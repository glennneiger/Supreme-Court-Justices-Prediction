felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
tell
us
to
whom
these
were
issued
prior
to
delivery?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
a
distribution
list,
i
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
each
one
of
these
agencies.
are
those
lists,
are
the
recipient
of
these
releases
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
characterization
of
them?
i
suppose
all
the
wire
services.
now,
what
specific
newspaper?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
delivery.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
were
on
file
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
were
22
speeches
delivered
over
a
span
of
what
two
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
four
years.
now,
was
the
registration
application
filed,
did
you
say
sometimes
two
or
three
years
after,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
an
application
in
--
in
block
for
all
of
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
are
any
of
the
challenge
publications
--
publications
that
were
made
in
the
intervening
period
that
is
between
delivery
of
these
speeches
and
notice
of
registration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
them
were
in
between
but
after
notice
was
sought
to
be
given
in
the
way
you've
indicated
by
retyping
or
whatever
it
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
1958.
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
cover
them
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
the
meantime
the
--
there
were
publications
in
non-allowed
source
--
at
non-allowed
sources
which
are
the
sale
as
infringement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
of
the
--
both
of
the
--
whatever
common
law
rights
maybe
claimed
or
are
there
no
common
law
rights
claimed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
look
for
so-called
common
law
rights
in
literary
property
and
for
the
protective
statutory,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
breaking
long
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
get
some
free
information
that
is
always
part
of
(inaudible)
must
you
take
out
a
--
how
much
of
a
quotation
requires
permission
that
every
sentence
of
a
concededly
copyrighted
word,
must
you
have
permission
for
every
clause
or
every
sentence
of
the
quotes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
--
that's
what
i've
been
noticing
that
people
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
ask
permission
for
--
half
the
clause
of
those
lines
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
another
work
or
--?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
another
work
not
--
why
did
the
dissemination
of
the
admiral
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
of
these
speeches
and
other
personal
curiosity,
how
many
of
these
speeches
of
the
educational
(inaudible)
of
the
admiral?
justice
felix
frankfurter
ten.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
the
10
--
i
don't
need
to
interrupt
you
though
i
do?
according
tanner
of
the
direction
of
this
argument
that
these
are
matters
that
are
in
guarantee
of
official
quality?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
it
is
implied
that
this
is
pre-legal
advice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
speak
on
behalf
of
all
members
of
the
court
and
i'm
not
authorized
to
do
so.
more
unto
this
court
go
and
address
to
learn
his
party
say
law
school
from
various
parts
of
the
country
on
the
jurisdiction
and
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
are
those
addresses
--
would
you
say
or
would
you
draw
a
distinction
that
those
addresses
are
not
copyrightable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
problem
i
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can
copyright
that
speech?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
specific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
when
i
talk,
except
from
the
bench,
i'm
not
a
judge,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
i'm
on
the
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
wouldn't
be
asking
if
we
weren't
justices.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
if
i
now
wrote,
to
be
very
specific,
if
i
now
wrote
to
mr.
landsford,
i
did
a
book
on
the
business
of
the
supreme
court,
is
that
copyrightable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
must
allow
my
secretary
to
take
part
in
that,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
much?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
arising
out
of
their
official
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
introductory
statement
of
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
brought
in
the
official
reports.
justice
felix
frankfurter
official
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
there
are
number
of
articles
in
the
--
what
is
that?
federal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no
the
--
not
the
supplement
for
the
f.2d,
but
another
series
of
federal
rules
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
see
from
time
to
time
articles
by
various
district
judges
about
pre-trial
practice,
discovery,
etcetera,
etcetera,
expositions
and
elucidations
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
judge
john
jones,
united
states
district
judge
for
the
seventh
district
of
new
york,
where
do
you
do
draw
the
line
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
private.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
would
follow
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
if
i
would
follow
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
know
what
they
said,
the
accusation
looks
like
it,
it
reads
like
it.
you
know
what
they
did
about
(inaudible)
that
all
qualities
of
fear
but
it
didn't
have
the
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
secretary
gates
disavowed
it.
that's
also
worth
evident
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet
--
yet
on
your
own
statement
awhile
ago,
though
the
chief
justice
authorizes
the
press
office
(inaudible)
whoever
does
that,
to
issue
a
release
about
some
personal
matter
or
some
personal
matters,
some
(inaudible)
and
so
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
release
because
you
are
little
too
universal
for
my
case
if
you
say
every
release
meaning,
everything
that
is
issued
through
the
information.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
government
might
say
mr.
rosefield
that
while
you
say
the
government
has
done
this
and
the
government
has
done
that
and
the
government
has
done
the
other
thing.
the
government
after
all
must
be
some
people.
and
the
government
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
except,
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
all
that
the
government
has
to
do
is
this
that
admiral
rickover
wrote
this
thing
at
home
so
you
told
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
he
brought
it
down
to
his
office
the
next
day.
he
then
told
his
secretary,
would
you
have
this
or
was
then
or
somebody
typed
it
out
(inaudible)
and
give
it
to
the
information
officer
and
distribute.
that's
all
the
government's
participation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well
--
but
certainly
the
registered
copyright
didn't
know
whether
this
rickover's
property
or
the
government's
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
i
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
then
pick
me
up.
and
there
--
and
therefore,
the
government
may
say
not
that
we
own
this
copyright
that
secretary
gates
may
say,
“i
have
no
idea
that
admiral
rickover
was
doing
this
thing.”
i'm
going
to
hold
them
over
to
close.
i'm
going
to
tell
him,
you
admiral,
don't
you
ever
do
this
again.
because
you,
yourself
has
indicated
that
these
are
nice
questions
as
to
what
is
done
within
the
job
and
what
is
done
outside
of
the
job,
sometimes
even
the
chief
justice
when
he
leaves
his
chair
as
a
chief
justice
and
he's
indicated
--
sometimes
the
justice
maybe
a
judge
when
he
leaves
the
chair.
these
are
nice
questions
and
they
can't
be
decided
by
such
appealing
generality
as
an
access
to
information?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
secretary
gates
may
say,
“you
have
no
business
to
have
this
done
on
government
time.
you
have
no
business
to
have
this
nice
blue
navy
label
over
there.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
we
are
foreclosed
by
what
secretary
gates
has
said
or
anything
there.
i'm
suggesting
that
in
the
scale
of
determination
that's
also
a
weightage
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
admiral
samuel
e.
morison,
who
is
the
official
historian
of
the
naval
warfare
of
the
last
war
in
his
whatever
it
is
(inaudible)
17
or
15
volume,
do
i
get
the
impression
that
these
are
not
copyrighted
by
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
he
was
put
on
to
reservist
the
other
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
this?
people
who
are
writing
the
history
of
either
army
or
navy
or
either
war,
meaning
by
that,
they
are
selected
by
the
armed
services
by
the
secretary
of
defense
or
even
the
president
as
to
admiral
morison
was.
they
are
officially
sent
to
have
full
access
to
all
the
documentation.
is
it
your
impression
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
the
service.
these
are
paid
by
uncle
sam.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
read
your
briefs,
but
do
you
deal
with
the
related
problem
of
invention
by
people
in
government
employ
--
employment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
a
very
--
this
court
has
found
that
a
very
thickly
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
to
those
–
as
to
the
323,
you
have
to
rest
on
the
common
law
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
mr.
mcdonald?
as
to
the
remission
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
court,
that
would
relate
to
further
speeches
by
the
admiral
and
not
--
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
as
to
those,
have
we
–
under
the
facts
in
the
record
as
to
what,
how
they
were
distributed
and
what
kind
of
flag
they
bore
or
see.
this
is
really
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
request
for
instruction
natural
enough
as
to
the
future
i
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
are
they
--
is
there
container
or
their
label
or
their
color
in
the
record
or
these
are
things
(inaudible)
these
are
naturally
relied
on,
what
about
those?
are
they
the
same
navy
then
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
don't
know
now,
it's
not
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
how
come
you
can't
advice
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
this
mean,
statement
of
fact
arrived
at
during
argument,
do
you
gentlemen
of
the
bar
talk
this
out
or
write
it
quickly,
that's
why
we
get
this
ambiguous
paragraph
3.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say
ambiguous
because
why
do
i
say
that.
if
there
are
speeches
that
were
made
available
through
the
public
information
office
in
the
next
sentence,
in
distributing
the
speeches
that
admiral
rickover
made,
i
wouldn't
call
that
elegant
phrase,
would
you
mr.
mcdonald?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i'm
pressing
you
on
this,
the
reason
(inaudible)
is
much
lighter
possible
is
when
i
have
to
look
a
little
ahead
in
this
by
chance
this
should
be
reversed
and
significantly
should
be
found
where
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
it
the
fact
that
the
flag
was
wrapped
around
--
not
wrapped
around
but
around
the
(inaudible)
with
the
seal
and
all
the
rest
the
court
in
its
opinion
should
--
should
find
significant
in
those
facts.
if
one
has
any
two
impression
of
the
admiral,
he
is
not
the
most
ironical
or
specific
character,
isn't
he?
and
he
might
find
there
differentiations
for
the
future,
so
then
i
want
to
know
what
are
we
deciding?
this
is
a
declaratory
judgment
case
and
therefore
we
have
to
be
forfeiting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
not
merely
to
recover
(inaudible)
the
fact
that
he
allowed
distribution
to
the
information
service,
if
the
fact
that
he
has
his
own
secretary
in
part
doing
it.
all
the
details
maybe
involved
in
under
an
opinion
and
therefore
leave
this
question
open
as
to
what
about
a
situation
where
these
ingredients
are
not
present
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
on
mr.
rosenfield's
argument,
the
copyright
makes
no
difference
if
these
other
elements
either
by
way
of
buttressing
or
essential
significant
are
in
the
case
and
he
may
take
them
out
of
a
specific
case
and
you'll
be
coming
up
here
and
say
no,
this
is
different
because
none
of
these
elements
suppress
it.
isn't
that
true?
it
doesn't
require
a
property
to
forecast
that
from
(inaudible)
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
government
told
him
that
it's
a
federal
conspiracy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
--
are
the
questions
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
mcdonald.
in
this
record,
whether
it
produced
any
letters
from
the
secretary
of
the
navy
amending
these
speeches
or
any
of
them
or
approval
of
the
educational
campaign
that
the
admiral
was
waging
or
saying
you're
doing
in
the
navy
a
great
service?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
department
take
any
note
of
these
speeches
feature
while
they
were
proceeding?
is
the
admiral
a
hot
favorite
of
the
department?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
does
it
appear
that
the
petitioner
here
wanted
to
re-print
in
bulk?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
go
back
a
minute,
please?
when
was
this
--
when
was
the
change
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
post
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
(voice
overlap),
anyhow,
litigation
was
in
the
air.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
famous
--
under
the
most
distinguished
scholars,
i
believe
the
founder
of
modern
sociology
--
a
great
deal
of
his
writing
on
sociology,
writing
from
employee
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
is
like
it,
but
i
shouldn't
suppose
that
would've
barred
him
from
copyrighting
his
books
on
dynamic
sociology
as
he
called
it,
but
what
he
--
although
he
disobeyed
orders
not
to
use
his
government
time
writing
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
of
course
he
would.
he
might
be
fired
but,
that
doesn't
bar
him
from
copyrighting
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
anything
like
it.
i
know
judges
who
write
novels
and
short
stories
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
--
to
refresh
my
--
rather
not
--
refresh
my
collection,
i
read
the
lewis
and
clark
opinion,
as
a
matter
of
literary
interest,
a
geographic
interest
and
i
forgot
what
--
i
didn't
obtain
what
the
real
decision
was.
but
technically
its
a
--
i
don't
know
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
what
did
they
decide
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
they
decide
in
that
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
stopped
there,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
stopped
in
the
court
of
appeals?
