mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
whether
an
official
government
press
release
is
a
government
publication.
if
it
is,
it
may
not
be
copyrighted.
more
broadly
stated,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
any
press
release,
government
or
private,
is
a
government
publication
within
the
statutory
restrictions
against
the
copyrighting
of
government
publication
when
it
comprises
a
speech
made
by
a
high
ranking
government
official,
delivered
while
on
official
duty
and
dealing
with
matters
falling
within
the
scope
of
his
official
duty
or
into
the
connection
or
relationship
between
that
duty
and
the
subject
matter
of
the
papers
involved.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
sought
the
declaratory
judgment
that
vice
admiral
hyman
g.
rickover
had
no
copyrightable
interest
in
23
of
his
public
speeches.
we
allege
that
this
was
so,
because
these
were
government
publications
and
therefore,
we’re
in
the
public
domain.
the
district
court
held
two
things.
first,
that
these
were
not
government
publications
and
secondly,
that
there
have
not
been
any
general
publications
and
therefore
copyright
was
properly
taken.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
first
point,
reversed
on
the
second
point,
and
remanded
for
trial
on
a
certain
titles.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
completely
undisputed,
your
honors.
the
petitioner
is
a
publisher
operating
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
respondent
is
the
honorable
and
highly
regarded
admiral
rickover,
who
during
all
of
the
time
of
these
proceedings
critical
dates
held
two
positions
simultaneously.
within
the
navy,
he
was
the
assistant
chief
of
the
bureau
of
ships
for
nuclear
propulsion
and
simultaneously,
within
the
atomic
energy
commission,
he
was
the
assistant
director
for
naval
reactors.
during
all
of
the
time
when
the
critical
facts
before
the
court
were
involved,
the
admiral
was
engaged
on
two
major
government
projects,
the
construction
of
this
country's
first
atomic
submarine,
the
nautilus
and
the
construction
of
this
country's
first
commercial
atomic
power
plant
at
shippingport,
pennsylvania.
between
october
of
1955
and
january
of
1959,
the
admiral
made
23
speeches,
publicly
delivered.
i
should
like
to
break
these
down
into
two
groups
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
the
23rd
one
had
on
its
face
a
copyright
registration.
the
other
22
did
not.
among
the
first
22
speeches,
13
were
issued
as
official
press
releases
of
the
department
of
defense.
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
printed
record
fails
to
disclose
this
clearly
enough,
i
have
asked
the
clerk
to
make
available
to
me
this
morning
the
actual
speech
press
releases
that
are
in
the
record
before
this
court,
this
is
from
your
record.
i
have
--
i've
chosen
four
at
random
out
of
the
13.
you
will
note
that
in
each
one,
this
is
the
portion
that
was
used
by
the
clerk
to
print
the
record,
this
little
piece
here,
you
will
note
that
across
the
top
of
each
one
of
these
speeches,
the
blue
band
news
release
please
note
this,
department
of
defense,
office
of
public
information,
washington
d.c.
in
the
center
is
the
co
of
the
department
of
defense.
off
to
this
side,
hold
for
release
until
delivery
of
the
press,
off
to
this
side
is
the
official
department's
number
of
the
press
release
number
and
its
series.
below
that
is
the
department
of
defense
telephone
and
the
extension
of
its
public
information
office,
so
that
anyone
can
get
further
information.
this
particular
speech
of
the
naval
revolution,
13
were
issued
in
this
particular
form.
additionally
to
this,
seven
were
issued
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
these
again
out
of
the
right
--
out
of
the
record.
not
quite
as
colorful,
but
across
the
side,
aec
and
on
the
top
of
it,
united
states
atomic
energy
commission,
washington
d.c.
for
release
and
the
telephone
number
for
future
information.
this
particular
one
or
i
should
say
that
in
each
case,
the
admiral
is
identified
by
his
official
titles
in
both
departments.
yes,
sir?
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
it
does,
sir.
the
one
that
i
read
to
you
earlier,
the
naval
revolution
says,
“hold
for
release
until
delivery
of
address
expected
about
2
p.m.
eastern
daylight
saving,
saturday
september
14th,
1957.”
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
in
--
there's
no
dispute
so
far
as
we
are
concerned.
the
allegation
by
the
respondent
is
that
that
negates
general
publication
in
part.
apart
from
that,
there's
no
dispute
that
i'm
aware
off
in
the
record.
the
similar
kind
of
information
appears
on
the
--
on
the
aec
press
release.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
certainly
shall,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
let
me
do
that
right
now.
each
of
this
was
released
by
the
department
of
defense
for
the
atomic
energy
commission
as
the
case
maybe
and
in
some
cases,
both.
they
were
released
widely
through
the
public
information
services
of
each
of
the
--
of
the
consigned
agency
as
a
--
well,
i
shall
draw
no
conclusion.
they
were
released
in
this
fashion.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
the
press
got
these.
they
were
issued
as
widely
as
the
department
of
defense
and
the
atomic
energy
commission
distributed
to
the
press,
to
anybody
else
that
asked
this
for
it.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
they
have
a
distribution
list.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
they
are
not,
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
none
were
indicated
except
that
mr.
justice
reed,
sitting
by
designation
below
characterized
them
in
discussing
--
in
discussing
the
issue
of
general
publication
is
saying
it
would
be
hard
to
have
distributed
them
all
widely
than
these
speeches
were
distributed.
i
should
like
to
continue
with
my
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
addition
to
being
distributed
officially,
each
of
the
speeches
was
distributed
by
the
admiral
in
three
ways.
first,
50
copies
were
made
available
by
him
to
the
sponsor
of
the
address
of
the
occasion.
in
each
case,
50
copies
were
made
available
by
him
personally
for
distribution
by
the
speeches
sponsored
to
the
press
or
others.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
before
delivery;
in
addition,
the
admiral
distributed
copies
to
those
who
asked
for
copies
after
delivery
or
to
those
unsolicited
whom
he
deemed
to
be
interested
in
this.
and
third,
he
distributed
them
or
he
had
them
distributed
at
the
national
press
club
here
in
washington,
although
not
one
of
the
23
speeches
was
there
delivered.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
they
were
on
the
press
release
table
as
handouts
for
anybody
to
take
bearing
in
mind
that
the
national
press
club
constitutes
45%
of
its
membership
as
non-press
people.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
the
record
is
not
clear
on
this
mr.
justice
whittaker,
but
i
think
this
much
is
clear.
i
assume
and
at
least
i
am
presenting
to
the
court
the
assumption
that
the
23rd
copy
which
i
have
here,
which
did
not
have
any
indication,
this
is
the
23rd
copy,
at
the
bottom
of
which
it
says,
“copyright
1958
h.g.
rickover.”
it
does
not
have
the
indicia
of
a
government
press
release.
i
assume
and
i
--
i
present
to
this
court
my
argument
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
released
only
by
him
personally
and
not
by
the
government.
apart
from
that,
the
record
is
silent
now,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
note,
your
honors
that
in
connection
with
these
government
press
releases,
there
was
neither
oral
nor
written
disclaimer
of
official
states.
no
way
does
there
appear
any
of
these
that
this
was
a
private
statement.
anything
which
would
indicate
anything
other
than
it
was
a
government
document.
there
was
no
limitation
on
its
use
or
in
the
nature
of
its
distribution.
i
might
add
that
the
first
22
which
were
not
copyright
registered
at
the
time
of
their
distribution
as
press
releases
was
subsequently
--
these
were
subsequently
registered
for
copyright
after
the
speech
had
been
delivered
and
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
you
simply
file
a
form,
i
have
here,
there's
a
copy
in
the
record,
the
form,
you
file
a
form
which
consist
of
two
short
pages,
give
the
author,
the
title,
the
date
of
the
publication,
what's
new
on
it,
and
sign
it,
and
pay
$2
and
it
registers.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
the
notation
under
the
law
must
be
on
the
copyrighted
item
at
the
first
date
of
publication
and
this
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
the
form
need
not
to
be
filed
first.
one
may
put
copyright
registration
on
it
and
then
file
after.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
one
of
the
cases
is
held
as
long
as
18
months.
the
courts
--
the
statute
says
reasonably
but
as
long
as
18
months
provided
no
one
has
been
deceived.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
the
form
was
filed
december
1st,
1958.
some
of
the
speeches
date
back
to
october
1955.
the
last
of
them
is
october
1959.
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court's
understanding
to
realize
that
when
these
were
copyrighted
after
distributed,
they
were
retyped
and
this
blue
band
and
the
slash
across
the
top,
atomic
energy
commission
were
cut
out,
so
that
the
copyright
office
had
concealed
from
it
the
original
nature
of
their
original
distribution.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
it
may
be.
it
may
be
significant.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
no
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
no,
sir.
because
the
--
the
statue
reads
that
they
make
--
no
copyright
may
subsist
in
matter
which
is
in
the
public
domain
and
therefore,
the
mere
copyright
registration
is
not
res
judicata
as
to
whether
it
is
or
is
not
in
public
domain.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
four
years.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
there
was
an
application
in
block
and
this
is
it.
they
were
all
filed
at
one
time,
the
first
22
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
--
were
filed
in
block
at
one
time
on
the
same
date,
but
with
a
separate
application
from
the
23rd.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes,
all
of
them
are,
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
beg
your
pardon.
let
me
make
sure
that
i
state
that
correctly.
these
speeches
were
delivered
and
the
press
releases
were
issued
in
a
period
between
october,
1955
and
the
end
and
prior
to
december
1st,
1959,
excuse
me,
1958.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
after
all
have
been
issued,
the
22,
as
press
releases,
after
that,
only
then
was
an
application
made
for
registration.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
to
cover
them
all.
plus
a
preface
which
is
not
here
involved.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
correct.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes,
sir.
but
the
claim
can't
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
that's
correct.
the
respondent
here
claims
he
had
common
law
right
because
these
were
not
published
as
distributed.
it's
important
for
the
court
to
realize
for
whatever
weight
it
wishes
to
give
it
mr.
brennan
--
mr.
justice
brennan
that
each
of
these
speeches
was
written
in
long
hand
according
to
the
record
by
the
admiral
at
home.
the
final
draft
of
each
of
these
speeches
was
typed
by
his
government
secretary
in
the
department
of
defense
on
government
facilities
and
government
time.
twenty
of
these
speeches
were
issued,
were
(inaudible)
by
government
officials
on
government
time
and
issued
as
government
materials.
two
of
these
first
22
were
not
issued
as
speeches
at
all,
but
were
used
in
other
ways.
the
department
of
defense
regulations
at
the
time
we're
involved
in
here.
forbid
the
use
of
defense
department
facilities
or
personnel
for
private
publications.
the
general
regulations
of
the
navy
at
the
time
here
involved
provide
that
in
connection
with
all
non-official
publications,
the
author
must
indicate
two
things,
a
positive
disclaimer
of
official
status
and
an
affirmative
statement
of
private
views.
it
is
clearly
recognized
and
admitted
that
as
to
all
23
of
these
speeches,
even
the
one
that
was
copyrighted,
the
prior
to
release,
no
such
disclaimer
was
made
despite
the
requirement
of
the
regulations.
all
23
of
these
speeches
were
delivered
while
the
admiral
was
on
official
duty.
he
had
not
taken
leave
for
personal
purposes.
only
four
of
these
speeches
were
delivered
in
the
city
of
washington.
all
the
others
including
one
in
general,
in
connection
with
all
the
others,
the
admiral's
travel
was
paid
for
by
the
government
of
the
united
states.
i
should
say
in
fairness,
that
when
honorarium
was
offered
to
the
admiral,
he
did
not
accept
them
personally,
but
he
designated
a
private
charity
for
that
transmission.
i
should
like
to
make
it
clear
at
the
outset
that
this
case
involves
no
question
of
secrecy
whatsoever
either
because
of
national
security
or
executive
privilege.
no
such
issue
was
involved
in
this
case.
the
issue
arose
when
the
petitioner
requested
copies
of
two
speeches,
the
last
two
that
were
not
copyrighted
in
order
to
pull
from
them
in
part.
the
admiral
refused
to
permit
him
to
quote
from
them,
although
he
wasn't
even
advised
and
didn't
know
how
much
quotation
was
involved.
now,
i
think
an
important
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
beg
your
pardon,
yes
sir?
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
second
circuit
said
that
this
question
of
fair
use
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
questions
in
the
whole
field
of
copyright.
i
have
attempted
to
brief
this
in
my
reply
brief.
the
normal
rule
seems
to
be
that
where
it's
small
enough
so
as
not
to
be
substantial
in
taking
away
the
person's
livelihood
or
economic
value
out
of
the
original
copyright
where
it
is
not
used
for
a
commercial
motive,
it
may
be
used.
but
this
question
of
fair
use
which
i
might
--
i
might
add
at
this
point,
the
admiral
says
it's
sufficient.
we
don't
need
a
constitutional
right
of
the
press.
all
you
have
is
fair
use.
fair
use
is
so
complicated
that
in
one
of
the
most
recent
issues
of
the
american
association
of
university
professors'
board,
a
professor
who
faces
this
came
to
the
sad
conclusion,
you
better
ask
for
consent.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
you
better
ask
for
consent
or
you're
in
trouble.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
that's
right,
sir.
i
happen
personally
to
be
the
executor
of
the
state
of
the
distinguished
author
and
i
get
questions
for
two
sentences,
request
for
two
sentences,
as
little
as
two
sentences
quotations,
it
irritates
me
but
i
don't
deny
it.
this
is
one
of
the
very
issues
and
we
have
said
that
to
be
--
to
be
relegated
to
fair
use
makes
no
sense
under
the
circumstances
and
in
any
event
doesn't
deprive
us
of
the
constitutional
right.
i
think
the
contents
of
these
speeches
are
of
the
utmost
importance
to
illustrate
our
position.
i
have
indicated
there
are
23
such
speeches.
ten
of
them
deal
with
a
naval
warfare
and
atomic
energy.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i'm
afraid
i've
failed
to
indicate
sir
that
this
was
a
proceeding
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
there
was
no
publication
made
in
this
case
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
they
would
have
been
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
quotations
from
the
speeches
as
is.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
in
another
work.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
should
say
sir
that
i'm
not
going
out
of
the
record.
i
wish
to
be
fair
to
the
court.
the
record
doesn't
disclose
that
it
would
be
in
another
word.
i
can
tell
you
from
my
personal
information
that
this
was
in
a
work
dealing
with
atomic
energy,
but
i
do
want
to
be
fair,
the
record
does
not
disclose
this
fact.

rosenfield
out
of
the
23,
10
are
on
naval
warfare
and
atomic
energy,
10
are
on
education
and
three
were
delivered
in
connection
with
the
bestowal
on
the
admiral
of
awards
or
medals
for
his
government
service
by
private
individuals.
i
should
like
to
discuss
each
of
these,
sir.
in
the
10
dealing
with
atomic
energy
and
naval
warfare,
two
main
subjects
were
discussed,
the
effect
--
the
industrial
effect
of
atomic
energy
on
naval
construction
and
the
revolutionary
effect
of
atomic
energy
on
naval
warfare.
let
us
look
to
the
speeches
themselves.
the
very
first,
i
should
say
that
on
page
105
and
106
of
the
record
is
a
list
of
these
various
speeches.
and
i
shall
refer
--
with
your
kind
permission,
i
shall
refer
to
the
numbers
in
the
order
in
which
they
appear
here
which
are
in
the
date
of
delivery.
the
very
first
speech
dealing
with
metallurgy
and
atomic
power
is
devoted
from
the
very
outset
and
i
quote,
“to
the
major
problems
in
the
use
of
metals
in
the
application
of
atomic
energy
to
the
propulsion
of
ships,
and
to
the
admiral's
besieging
his
audience,
the
national
metals
congress
for
help
in
solving
these
varied
problems.
the
eight
speech,
“the
challenge
of
nuclear
power”,
and
i'm
choosing
two
in
each
instance,
exhorts
industry
to
help
in
the
technical
and
industrial
aspects
of
his
official
job.
permit
me
to
quote
one
paragraph
and
i'm
quoting
as
indicated
on
our
brief
at
page
29.
“just
as
the
strength
of
a
chain
is
no
greater
than
that
of
its
weakest
link,
so
that
the
successful
operation
of
a
nuclear
power
plant
depends
on
the
reliability
of
all
its
parts,
not
alone
the
nuclear
reactor,
but
also
the
heat
exchanges,
pumps,
valves
etcetera.
in
fact,
our
experience,”
said
the
admiral,
“with
the
full
operating
plants
of
the
naval
reactors
program
has
shown
that
it
is
these
components,
the
industrial
components,
which
are
proved
less
reliable
than
the
nuclear
reactor
itself
and
also
their
delivery
time
is
poor.
here,
i
believe
is
the
challenge
to
industry,”
he
threw
out.
as
to
the
second
general
subject
in
these
10
speeches
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
mr.
chief
--
justice
frankfurter
is
always
ahead
of
me,
the
answer
is
yes.
the
purpose,
the
thrust
of
my
argument
is
that
all
23
of
these
speeches
as
will
be
indicated,
are
part
of
the
official
scope
of
his
duty.
the
second
group
in
the
first
10,
dealt
with
the
revolutionary
effect
of
nuclear
energy
on
naval
warfare.
the
second
speech,
nuclear
power
and
the
navy
had
as
it
theme
and
i
quote,
“the
impact
of
nuclear
power
on
the
navy
and
two
of
the
basic
principles
of
waging
naval
warfare.”
the
speech
goes
on
at
great
length
to
tell
how
the
nautilus,
our
submarine
which
he
constructed
came
to
be
built,
the
navy's
plans
for
future
vessels
of
the
same
kind
and
the
atomic
energy's
plans
for
future
naval
reactors,
bearing
in
mind,
both
of
these
were
his
employers.
and
the
last
of
these
10
first
speeches
on
industrial
effect
that
i
should
like
to
quote,
is
the
one
revolution
at
sea
11
and
14
are
substantially
identical
although
with
different
titles
and
the
theme
here
was,
and
i
read
from
the
bottom
of
page
29,
“today,
our
navy
is
in
the
midst
of
another
change,
conversion
from
oil
to
nuclear
power
and
he
deals
at
great
length
was
the
conversion
to
nuclear
power
and
the
resulting
effect
on
naval
warfare.
so
much
for
the
content
of
the
first
10
speeches,
now
to
the
second
10
group
and
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
the
first
10
came
in
the
first
order.
these
are
simply
by
classification,
those
dealing
with
the
relationship
of
national
defense
for
education.
at
this
point,
it
is
important
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
as
we've
done
on
our
brief,
certain
--
certain
little
known
facts
of
record
and
a
public
record
concerning
the
admiral's
own
duties
in
his
own
job.
it
is
our
point,
and
i
think
sufficiently,
we
hope
proved
in
the
--
in
the
brief,
that
the
admiral's
official
duties,
this
particular
admiral's
official
duties
required
him
to
be
an
educator,
to
operate
schools
in
his
official
duty.
i
direct
your
attention
to
the
quotation
from
the
23rd
speech
which
appears
on
page
31
of
our
brief,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
you
will
recall
that
this
was
the
speech
that
was
attempted
to
be
copyrighted
before
issuance.
i'll
read.
though,
and
i'm
quoting
of
course
from
the
admiral,
“though
i
have
never
taken
a
course
in
education,
i
have
been
running
schools
for
years.
we
have
set
up
schools
for
our
own
engineers,
and
for
our
industrial
people
as
well
as
for
officers
and
men
who
operate
on
nuclear
ships.
in
our
post-graduate
program,
we
teach
the
exacting
requirements
of
reactor
design,
construction
and
management.”
in
testimony
before
a
congressional
committee
in
the
very
period
in
question
here
between
55
and
59,
specifically
in
1957
and
i
quote
from
the
bottom
of
page
34
of
our
brief,
the
admiral's
total
to
house
appropriation
to
make,
“we
run
quite
a
number
of
schools
of
our
own
because
there
is
a
great
shortage
of
scientists
and
engineers
and
we
found
we
could
not
depend
too
much
on
our
schools
and
our
available
training
program.
we
have
to
train
our
own.
we
are
running
at
the
present
time
within
the
period
of
question.
a
number
of
different
schools
within
the
naval
program
ranging
from
the
one
of
the
submarine
base
at
new
london,
connecticut
for
teaching
nuclear
theory
to
officers
and
unlisted
man
to
others
and
i
shall
not
continue.”
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
clearly
shows
--
the
public
record
clearly
shows
that
one
of
these
schools
was
created
by
the
admiral
for
his
own
work.
speech
number
15,
dealing
with
education
in
the
nuclear
age,
shows
on
its
phase
that
was
delivered
as
the
dedication
of
the
new
london
school
to
which
he
talks,
which
he
created
and
he
asks
questions
in
his
dedicatory
remarks.
“why
do
we
need
a
school
here
that
cost
so
much
money?
why
do
we
need
a
school
which
is
limited
in
its
clientele?”
and
he
answers,
“bearing
in
mind
that
this
is
the
navy's
nuclear
expert
number
one,
we
have
no
choice,
but
to
develop
a
new
kind
of
navy
man
to
run
a
new
kind
of
ship.
the
schools
--
the
school
provides
the
kind
of
education
needed
by
officers
and
men
of
a
nuclear
navy
not
provided
elsewhere.”
i
have
indicated
that
he
was
employed
by
two
agencies
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
as
well.
he
created
a
school
for
them.
i
quote
from
his
testimony
before
a
congressional
committee.
in
1959
when
he
was
asked
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee
to
state
your
qualifications
for
talking
about
education,
and
in
part
the
admiral
said,
“i
was
instrumental
in
setting
up
the
oakridge
school
of
reactor
technology
in
oakridge
for
the
atomic
energy
commission.”
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
think
sir
--
and
this
is
one
of
the
tough
problems
that
we
face
in
our
(inaudible).
i
think
there
might
have
been
a
difference
because
here,
he
was
purporting
to
speak
for
the
government.
in
each
case,
he
was
dealing
with
matters
within
the
confines
of
his
own
official
duty
as
we
shall
show.
he
was
dealing
with
matters
within
his
own
peculiar
knowledge,
not
available
to
anyone
else.
we're
not
stressing
beyond
stating
it
that
the
issue
also
involves
use
of
government
facilities.
we're
pointing
out
our
major;
the
gravamen
of
our
argument
is
although
we
bring
the
other
end
that
he
was
in
the
conduct
of
his
official
duties.
now,
if
he's
beyond
his
official
duties,
different
questions
arise
and
they
could
well
have
been
a
different
ruling
in
our
judgment.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
the
lateral
mr.
justice
harlan.
there's
no
question
as
to
the
fact.
we
believe
they
applied
the
wrong
rule
of
law.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
the
rule
of
law
applied
by
the
court
below
was
that
a
publication
could
be
a
government
publication,
only
if
it
was
called
for
by
his
duties.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
that's
right
or
to
put
it
in
his
blunter
terms
as
the
trial
justice
put
it,
the
works
for
higher
doctrine,
that
he
wasn't
hired
to
make
speeches.
he
wasn't
hired
to
write
speeches.
our
position
is
two-fold.
first
of
all,
here
is
one
of
the
navy's
top
26
people.
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
this
regard
that
the
admiral
himself
rejects
the
--
the
argument
of
works
for
hire.
at
the
bottom
of
page
21
of
our
brief,
we've
indicated
from
a
transcript,
i
regret
your
honors
that
this
is
in
typed
--
imprinted
form
yet
but
it's
our
reason.
the
respondent's
own
view
of
his
duties,
“i
do
not
know
what
hat
i
am
wearing.
i
understand
that
i
have
some
job
descriptions
in
the
navy
and
the
aec
but
i
have
been
too
busy
to
read
them.
i
only
know
that
i
am
responsible
and
that
is
enough”
and
we
think
he's
right
and
the
court
below
was
wrong.
when
you
get
a
man
of
this
high
level
of
discretionary
authority
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
issue
that's
confronting
the
man
in
his
official
duty
is
what
he
makes
to
the
job.
somebody
else
would
have
made
a
difference
your
honor.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
in
my
judgment
the
howard
and
lyons
case,
360
u.s.
in
1959
answers
this.
the
court
is
not
foreclosed
from
looking
at
whether
or
not
this
is
official
duty
merely
because
the
united
states
says
it
is
or
is
not.
the
facts
speak
for
themselves.
the
fact
that
--
that
there
was
a
--
a
statement
that
this
was
not
his
official
duty,
i
think
is
contradicted
by
the
facts
of
the
record
in
the
speeches
themselves
and
in
the
way
this
man
behaved
on
his
job.
for
example
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
my
recollection
is
there
was
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
there
was.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
sir,
if
i
can
give
any
pre-legal
advice
to
the
distinguished
justice,
i
shall
be
honored.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
would
say
they
are
not
copyrightable
sir
and
we
brief
this
in
our
brief
for
this
reason.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
been
so
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
no,
no.
i
understand
sir.
i
realize
the
purpose
of
the
question.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
well,
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
impregnate
but
i
have
taken
the
liberty
at
pages
15
and
16
of
our
reply
brief,
this
green
document
of
making
these
various
observations
that
merely
because
a
speech
or
a
page
--
this
by
the
way
does
--
is
limited
to
speech,
it
could
be
a
memorandum,
a
paper.
merely
because
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
merely
because
something
is
written
by
a
person
who
is
in
the
government
service
doesn't
mean
that
it's
a
part
of
his
official
job.
for
example,
(inaudible)
was
surprised
when
edwin
arlington
robinson
was
in
the
u.s.
customs
bureau,
that
doesn't
make
his
poetry,
government
publications
nor
to
answer
the
--
your
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
be
personal
in
respect
of
members
of
this
court
when
the
chief
justice
made
a
speech
in
california
before
the
cardiovascular
agency
and
talking
about
foreign
affairs,
i
don't
think
this
was
a
public
document.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
think
he
can
copyright
that
speech.
[laughter]
i
think
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
a
very
interesting
difference
as
to
the
way
they're
treated.
this
is
the
copy
of
the
press
release
of
the
chief
justice's
remarks.
the
chief
justice
looks
surprise.
[laughter]
i
got
it
--
i
got
it
served
from
the
public
information
office.
you
notice
the
difference
in
handling
this.
the
chief
justice
doesn't
purport
to
speak
in
official
capacity.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
[attempt
to
laughter]
now
our
point
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
our
point
is
this,
on
the
point
that
you
raise;
the
constitution
of
the
united
state
says
that
the
judicial
power
shall
extend
to
cases
and
controversies.
chief
justice
marshall
said
in
osborne
against
the
bank,
“the
judicial
power
is
capable
of
being
acted
upon
only
when
the
subject
is
submitted
in
a
case.”
mr.
justice
field
in
smith
against
adams
in
130
u.s.,
mr.
justice
day
in
muskrat
219
said
the
same
thing.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
with
one
exception
sir,
with
one
exception.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
of
course
still
you're
on
the
bench.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
think
the
chief
justice
has
two
additional
obligations.
one,
the
obligation
under
the
constitution
to
sit
at
the
impeachment,
to
preside
over
the
impeachment
of
the
president,
i
think
this
is
an
official
duty.
secondly,
to
preside
over
the
judicial
congress
and
of
course
this
court
has
the
obligation
of
rules.
if
what
happened
by
members
of
this
distinguished
happens
within
the
confines
of
those
things,
i
think
its
government
publication.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
that's
right,
that's
right.
but
it
isn't
related
to
the
work
for
which
the
scope
of
your
authority
is
limited
by
the
constitution.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
think
it
is
sir.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
no
sir,
we're
not
arguing
and
i
wanted
to
make
it
clear
sir,
we're
not
arguing
alone
that
the
fact
that
the
secretary
was
used
or
the
government
paper
was
used
is
sufficient.
we
do
argue
as
the
sawyer
case
did
in
the
second
circuit
that
one
may
draw
an
inference
from
the
use
of
government
facilities
as
to
whether
or
not
the
author
deemed
them
to
be
the
government.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
exactly.
there
are
some
things
--
there
are
some
things
in
which
i
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
leave
the
matter
to
be
settled
by
disciplinary
action
on
the
administrative
level,
but
to
be
specific
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
don't
--
we
have
a
specific
question,
again,
forgive
me
for
being
personal.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
black
delivered
successive
lectures
at
the
madison
lecture
series
on
the
bill
of
rights
in
new
york
university.
i
don't
think
these
are
government
publications
and
we
don't
claim
they
are
government
publications.
our
claim
is
not
that
everything
that
government
officer
does
is
public.
only
those
things
connected
or
related
with
their
official
function
makes
the
product
part
of
his
official
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
not
necessarily
merely
arising
out
but
connected
with
or
related
with.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
this
sir
is
--
is
clear.
there,
the
documents
that
dealt
with
his
official
duty
were
not
copyrighted.
the
rec
--
the
opinions
of
this
court,
the
documents
that
dealt
with
things
that
his
official
duty
did
not
require
him
to
do
were
privately
copyrighting,
which
is
precisely
what
we
are
arguing.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
well,
but
it
was
--
it
wasn't
the
head
notes
there
that
were
involved.
it
was
--
it
was
the
--
the
descriptive
notes
in
which
he
did
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
well,
but
whether
he
--
whether
he
did
at
night
or
at
any
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
no.
the
rows
note
and
that
kind
of
note.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
were
notes
that
were
unrelated
to
the
specific
facts
of
the
case
but
show
where
this
case
fit
into
general
jurisprudence
of
the
subject.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
well
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
that's
right.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
but
--
but
we
are
not
saying
that
as
to
these,
these
were
part
of
his
job.
in
other
words,
we
come
back
to
the
point,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
for
it
to
be
part
of
the
public
duty,
it's
got
to
be
part
of
his
job.
i
might
add
furthermore
that
the
whitton
case
was
decided
by
the
court
prior
to
the
statutes
here
involved.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
in
1895
and
1899
so
that
one
of
the
--
the
major
tripod,
part
of
the
tripod
on
which
i'm
arguing
wasn't
present
in
those
cases,
but
i
think
the
rule
would
be
the
same,
that
these
were
not
related
to
his
job,
just
as
the
reporter
of
this
court
at
this
time,
if
he
would
to
write
descriptive
analysis
of
the
jurisprudence
resulting
from
this
court's
activities
would
not
be
within
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
lawyers
edition.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
federal
rules
of
decisions.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
say
that's
private
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
because
again,
the
judicial
power
is
limited
as
judicial
power
to
cases
in
congress.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
and
this
is
why
i
exempt
it
–
exempt
it
from
my
previous
remarks.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
mr.
justice
brennan,
i've
been
--
i've
been
torn
in
writing
this
brief
on
certain
issues
because
i
was
tempted
to
follow
what
mr.
justice
jackson
once
said,
“never
cite
to
this
court
anything
that
one
of
its
members
wrote
off
the
bench.”
and
i
think
in
a
real
sense,
what
he
was
saying
is
what
i'm
talking
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
pardon?
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
haven't
followed
it
myself
sir.
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
snide
or
but
i
think
--
i
think
you
can
drive
me
to
a
difficult
point.
i'm
not
of
all
sure
that
when
i
heard
the
chief
justice
spoke
before
the
federal
bar
association
on
the
question
of
the
delaying
the
courts
but
then
he
was
talking
officially,
because
of
his
--
the
character
of
his
activities
before
the
judicial
conference.
i
think
if
the
chief
justice
were
to
ask
one
of
the
justices
right
in
the
circuit,
to
conduct
the
surveillance
over
the
--
the
affairs
of
the
circuit,
i
think
i'd
be
implying
to
say
that
that
was
official
duty
rather
than
private.
i
think
there
can
be
--
the
tough
case
will
always
come,
but
i
think
the
overall
umbrella,
is
that
as
a
whole,
if
may
be
permitted
to
put
it
in
this
bluntness
terms
you
speak
only
when
you
sit
on
that
chair,
ex
cafadra
and
not
otherwise
with
the
exception
of
these
other
things
which
i
have
mentioned.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
no.
i've
been
trying
to
say
no
sir.
i
certainly
would
not
think
that
your
speeches
on
traffic
safety
mr.
justice
clark
are
government
publications.
i
think
those
were
in
your
private
capacity,
a
very
important
capacity
but
private.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
should
like
to
move
to
the
question
of
the
second
group
of
speeches
because
again,
i
think
the
facts
here
are
the
critical
things
before
the
court.
to
come
back
to
the
question
that
was
raised,
i
think
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
not,
that
there
is
any
dispute
on
the
facts,
but
as
to
the
rule
of
law
to
be
applied
to
the
facts.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
both
sir;
we
allege
--
our
fundamental
argument
is
this,
that
there
is
--
there
are
two
statutes
which
say
that
there
shall
be
no
copyright
of
any
kind
either
by
the
government
or
the
author,
in
government
publications.
the
difficulty
with
the
situation
is
that
there's
no
definition
of
government
publication
so
that
this
court
has
to
turn
to
the
general
rules
of
law.
on
that
score,
we
have
two
arguments.
the
first,
that
this
court
has
frequently
decided
the
meaning
of
words
not
defined
in
the
statute
and
its
basic
position
always
has
been
in
this
respect
to
use
the
sensible
interpretation.
the
ordinary
meaning
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
the
words
of
many
usages,
you
use
the
familiar
meaning
that
the
ordinary
man
accords
to
and
our
position
on
this
court
is
putted
in
its
bluntness
terms
is
very
simple.
this
purports
to
be
a
government
document.
it
looks
like
a
government
document.
it's
issued
and
treated
as
a
government
document.
it's
regarded
by
the
people
who
received
it
as
a
government
document,
on
the
government's
rule
of
a
common
sense
interpretation.
it
is
the
government.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
but
this
did
[laughter]
this
does.
this
has
the
authority
of
the
issuing
agency.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes,
but
here
it
is
under
his
only
imprimatur
and
furthermore
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
sixteen
are
of
this
character,
seven
are
of
the
atomic
energy
commission,
two
are
not
released
at
all
and
one
has
no
government
imprimatur
at
all,
the
23rd
and
what
i
am
saying
sir
is
very
simple.
i'm
saying
that
a
government
press
release
is
a
government
publication
and
lest
i've
interpreted
as
saying
this
alone.
let
me
point
out
to
you,
that
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
place
upon
the
superintendent
of
documents
in
the
government
printing
office,
the
obligation
of
publishing
a
monthly
catalog
of
government
publications.
he
has
said
on
an
official
press
release
is
a
government
document.
the
library
of
congress
in
a
publication's
bibliography
of
government
documents
has
said
likewise.
the
american
library
association
has
said
likewise
and
i
--
i
venture
to
say
that
mr.
justice
harlan
in
barr
said
the
same
thing
although,
i
shan't
--
i
shan't
not
go
into
that
at
this
point.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
here
it
is.
look
at
the
difference.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
you
caught
me
up
in
a
mistake.
every
release
which
purports
to
be
a
release
of
the
government
on
which
the
government
has
made
the
decision
that
this
is
to
be
a
government
release
with
the
consent
to
the
author
as
in
this
case,
because
he
personally
distributed
the
same
things
with
his
consent.
we
say
that
irrespective
of
anything
else,
although
this
is
by
no
means
our
whole
argument,
this
is
only
really
the
threshold
of
our
argument
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
black,
that
this
becomes
a
government
document
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
your
honors
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
within
the
22,
the
first
22.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i'd
like
at
this
point
to
get
to
the
23rd,
because
here,
we
have
a
problem
of
the
general
rule
of
law,
because
this
doctrine
that
i
have
talked
about,
the
common
sense,
interpretation
and
statute,
applies
only
to
the
one
so
denominated.
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
problem
of
when
there
--
when
an
individual
in
the
public
service
has
acted
within
the
confines
and
the
scope
of
his
official
duty.
and
we
think
there
are
two
cases
--
two
groups
of
cases,
first,
the
copyright
cases.
in
the
sawyer
case
in
the
second
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
this
precise
subject.
there,
an
employee
of
the
department
of
the
interior,
the
executive
assistant,
a
high
level
employee
was
sent
to
the
--
to
alaska
to
inspect
reindeer,
i
don't
quite
know
whether
he
counted
them
but
he
inspected
reindeer
and
these
facilities
of
the
department.
he
came
back
had
a
map
drawn
and
copyrighted
it.
the
district
court
said
that
where
an
employee
creates
something
in
connection
with
his
duties
under
the
employment,
it
belongs
to
the
employer.
this
map
was
prepared
as
a
result
of
and
relating
to
his
duties
in
alaska.
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
rule
of
law.
a
similar
rule
of
law
was
adopted
in
the
colorful
lewis
and
clark
expedition,
about
captain
clark's
notes,
but
i'd
like
to
go
further.
this
court
has
had
to
decide
when
things
are
done
within
the
course
of
official
duty
and
here,
i
come
back
to
the
barr
case.
the
problem
arises
in
defamation
cases,
where
the
issue
is,
where
otherwise
actionable
liable
is
issued
by
a
government
employee,
is
it
privileged
because
it's
within
its
official
duty.
in
the
spalding
case,
spalding
against
vilas
in
1896,
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
that
the
test
of
official
duty
was
whether
it
involved
and
i
quote,
“action
having
more
or
less
connection
with
the
general
matters
committed
by
law
is
control
or
supervision”.
the
precisely
same
rule
was
established
in
the
barr
case
in
1959
and
whatever
the
--
the
split
in
the
court
may
have
been
on
the
issue
of
privilege
--
of
privilege
whether
absolute
or
conditional,
both
sides
of
the
court
was
one
exception.
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
was
the
one
exception,
accept
that
this
rule
of
law
of
connection
is
settling
the
issue.
now
how
closely
the
relation
should
be,
the
connection
that
i'm
talking
about?
spalding
said
more
or
less
connected.
barr
said
that
it
is
sufficient
if
the
action
comes
within
the
outer
perimeter
of
the
petitioner's
line
of
duty.
the
sawyer
case
said
it's
sufficient
if
it's
in
the
general
area
of
the
widest
relationship.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
barr
case,
this
court
specifically
rejected
the
doctrine
established
below,
in
answer
to
mr.
harlan,
i'm
talking
to
the
rule
of
law
and
not
the
facts.
the
court
below
said
that
it
had
to
be
required
by
his
official
duties.
this
court
in
barr
specifically
rejected
and
i
quote,
from
the
bottom
of
page
23
of
my
brief,
“that
petitioner
was
not
required
by
law
or
by
direction
of
his
superiors
to
speak
out.”
remember,
this
was
a
press
release
case
your
honors.
it
was
not
required,
cannot
be
controlling
in
the
case
of
an
official,
a
policy
making
rank,
where
the
concept
of
duty
encompasses
the
sound
exercise
of
discretionary
authority.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
exactly
right
sir
and
my
position
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
the
government
has
never
done
it
and
this
is
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
well,
we
have
two
standards.
this
is
part
of
the
--
of
the
reason
for
our
constitutional
argument.
we
say
in
this
particular
case
on
the
doctrine
of
the
court
in
the
wilmington
parking
authority
case
in
the
last
session
of
this
court,
in
the
last
term
of
this
court.
we
say
that
the
united
states
government
is
a
joint
participant
in
the
legal
act
--
in
the
illegal
activity.
we
say
that
--
that
the
very
point
you've
made
sir.
this
is
part
of
our
complaint
whereas
the
government
has
in
other
cases
as
we've
shown
in
our
brief
prevented
individuals
from
doing
precisely
what
others
in
the
military
service,
it
didn't
here
and
that
by
illegally
failing
to
prevent
him,
it
was
a
joint
participant.
furthermore
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
in
an
--
in
unconstitutional
depravation
of
our
right
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
we
claim
sir
that
the
first
amendment,
is
abridged
in
this
case
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
a
copyright
--
a
private
copyright
monopoly
over
publicly
made
speeches
within
the
scope
of
official
federal
duty,
is
the
denial
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
on
the
ground
that
the
basic
purpose
of
the
freedom
of
press
guarantee
of
the
first
amendment,
was
to
protect
the
people's
right
to
know.
and
that
the
freedom
of
the
press
concept,
was
not
to
give
certain
business
special
rights.
but
through
then
to
protect
the
people's
right
to
know
and
what
we're
saying
in
this
case
is
a
very
simple
thing
that
the
decision
below
hobbles
this
right
to
know.
and
that
as
mr.
justice
holmes
said,
there's
a
line
of
growth
of
constitutional
argument.
200
years
ago,
the
zenga
case
said
there
was
liberty
to
print.
83
years
ago,
this
court
in
jackson
said,
there
was
liberty
to
distribute.
four
years
ago
the
buckler
case
said
there
was
liberty
to
read.
we
are
saying
now
with
the
constitution
being
a
sensitive
document
under
the
hurtado
case
that
freedom
of
access
is
the
next
step,
because
of
the
new
york
times
said
not
so
long
ago.
freedom
to
produce
a
blank
page
is
hardly
freedom
of
the
press.
freedom
of
access
to
governmentally
released
documents,
we
contend,
is
part
of
freedom
of
press.
in
the
cumming's
case,
this
court
said,
that
constitution
deals
with
substance
not
challenge,
with
the
thing
not
the
name.
your
honors,
we
say
that
at
this
time
in
history,
the
thing
and
freedom
of
the
press
is
freedom
of
access
to
officially
released
government
document.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
quite
the
contrary
we
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
well,
if
we
adopt
the
argument
that
it
has
given
in
the
prima
facie
right
prevent
us
from
publishing
this
material
at
the
penalty
of
$250
fine
each
time
they
publish
any
one
document,
we
are
saying
that
they
have
participated
in
an
illegal
grant
of
copyright
registration,
which
they
had
no
right
to
give
because
this
was
a
government
document.
they
--
the
government
administers
the
copyright.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
that's
correct
and
we
are
saying
that
failure
to
do
so
makes
them
a
joint
participant
in
the
abridgement
of
our
constitutional
right.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
that's
right.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
it
also
register
this
--
it
also
registered
the
copyright.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes
sir.
the
government
operates
the
copyright
office.
the
government
operates
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
well,
what
we
are
saying
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
no.
i'm
not
saying
access
to
information.
i'm
saying,
connection
with
his
work.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
well,
i
come
back
sir
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
said
in
the
howard
(voice
overlap)
it
isn't
that.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
have
no
doubt
about
that
sir
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
this
court
has
before
it
and
agreed
this
example
of
evasion
of
law
as
we
have
shown
in
our
--
in
our
petition.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
well,
i
say
two
things
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
this
is
only
part
of
my
argument.
my
argument
is
that
a
government
publication
by
statue
is
in
the
public
domain
and
cannot
be
copyrighted.
therefore,
i
have
a
right
to
use
a
government
publication
by
statute
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
this
is
correct,
but
what
we
are
claiming
here
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
we
are
claiming
--
we
are
claiming
--
we're
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment
to
prevent
the
admiral
from
attempting
to
prevent
us
from
using
the
stuff.
he
claims
the
right
to
this
and
if
we
--
if
we
are
put
to
the
actual
publication
of
it
and
we
may
have
to
pay
in
on
the
sums
in
penalties
under
the
constitution
--
under
the
statute.
we're
saying,
in
addition
to
our
constitutional
right,
that
we
have
the
right
under
the
statute
to
publish
any
document
which
is
a
government
publication
that
this
is
a
government
publication
and
we
have
a
right
to
publish
it
and
we
wish
a
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
in
part
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
our
statutory
position
and
our
constitutional
position
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
that's
--
that's
right
sir
and
in
connection,
if
i
may
make
one
private
further
comment
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
point.
in
connection
with
our
argument,
we
have
shown
in
our
petition,
cases
in
which
they
were
admitted
public
documents.
documents;
if
you
look
at
50
--
page
53
of
the
gray
volume,
a
document
which
is
admittedly
an
official
history
of
the
united
states
army
in
world
war
ii.
if
you
look
at
the
bottom,
it's
copyrighted
by
the
army
historian.
and
then
the
next
succeeding
pages
54
and
55,
we
see
a
whole
list
of
28
volumes
admittedly
government
documents,
admittedly
official
histories
privately
published
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
absence
of
an
opportunity
given
for
this
court
to
state
clearly
what
the
issue
is
has
caused
what
we
think
to
be
an
erosion
of
a
statutory
right
and
a
serious
breach
of
statutory
requirement.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
don't
know
the
facts
sufficient.
first
of
all,
the
admiral
is
not
a
public
official.
he
was
once
but
he
isn't
now.
he's
a
professor
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
no,
it
is
not
my
position
that
merely
because
access
is
made
to
official
use
by
private
people
that
the
documents
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
well,
there
is
a
very
strong
problem
as
to
when
the
question
of
contract
employees
come
in,
but
i'm
talking
about
official
employees
of
the
united
states
government
and
my
position
is
that
where
the
army
historian,
a
general
of
the
united
states
army
is
full-time
employed
by
the
army
for
the
purpose
of
writing
history,
this
is
a
government
document
and
i
say
it's
publication
as
a
private
document
is
a
breach
of
statute
and
a
denial
of
constitution.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
we
--
we
attempt
--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
your
honor,
in
our
reply
brief,
this
green
document,
we
--
we
attempt
to
point
out
that
the
dubiliar
case,
which
is
the
principal
case
involved
is
clearly
inapplicable
here
for
variety
of
reasons,
including
among
other
that
it
is
mooted
by
an
executive
order
that
there
was
a
fundamental
difference
between
--
in
the
statute
as
well
as
in
the
constitutional
picture
between
the
copyright
and
the
patent
law
and
we
also
point
out
whatever
value
it
may
have
that
the
admiral
himself
in
connection
with
that
position
affirmed
the
position
we're
affirming
here.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
this
is
--
this
is
precisely
what
i
claim
and
if
i
may
be
permitted
just
a
moment
to
explain
that.
let's
take
this
speech,
the
very
first
speech
in
which
he
complains
of
the
industry's
failure
to
produce
the
right
things.
he's
saying
that
the
valves
are
no
good
that
you
don't
produce
on
time
and
you're
holding
this
down
on
the
national
defense.
let
us
suppose
in
the
sense
that
mr.
justice
black
is
doing
that
there
was
only
one
contractor
that
was
obviously
involved
in
this.
and
it
was
clear
that
everybody
concern
that
the
admiral
was
maligning
that
contractor.
there
is
not
doubt
in
my
mind
and
i
think
there
wouldn't
be
any
in
this
court's
mind
that
the
admiral
would
have
the
right
under
the
barr
against
matteo
both
majority
and
minority,
mr.
justice
stewart
except,
in
saying
that
this
was
privileged
because
it
was
part
of
his
official
duty.
now
the
admiral
can't
have
it
both
ways.
he
can't
say
it's
privileged
because
it's
governmental
there,
but
it's
non-governmental
here
and
therefore,
i
can
copyright
it
and
this
is
this
--
the
gravamen
of
our
position.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes
sir,
because
the
fundamental
issue
is
the
same,
the
scope
of
official
duty.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
no
sir,
they
were
not
because
there
were
two
sets
of
regulations.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
activities
of
the
department
of
defense,
under
the
department
of
defense
regulations
and
i'm
--
may
i
refer
you
to
page
102.
i
should
like
to
emphasize
by
my
voice
the
different
points
i
wish
to
point
out
in
the
first
and
second
sentence.
personnel
of
the
department
of
defense,
military
and
civilians,
who
write
for
outside
publication
not
in
connection
with
their
official
duties,
we
claim
this
was
in
connection
with
official
duties.
in
the
second
sentence,
search
activity
will
not
be
conducted
during
normal
working
hours
or
accomplish
with
the
use
of
department
of
defense
facilities
or
personnel.
in
this
case,
it's
admitted
that
this
was
breached.
he
did
use
official
personnel,
he
did
use
official
facilities.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
yes
sir,
at
two
levels.
the
district
judge
invited
the
u.s.
attorney
for
the
district
of
columbia
into
the
case
and
it
was
rejected
or
at
least
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
availed
though
and
in
--
in
our
petition
before
the
court
on
page
29,
this
gray
volume,
we
asked
--
page
29
of
the
gray
volume
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
made
a
special
request
to
this
court,
i
don't
need
to
be
interpreted
with
the
court
mr.
chief
justice,
but
want
to
answer
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
requesting
this
court
to
ask
the
solicitor
general
to
file
a
major
security
even
in
connection
with
our
petition
or
if
granted
in
connection
with
the
--
with
the
merits
for
five
reasons,
as
an
employer,
as
an
administrator
of
the
copyright
office
who
had
to
know
the
meaning
of
17
u.s.c.
8,
as
an
operator
on
the
government
public
printing
office
who
had
to
know
what
a
government
publication
is,
as
a
government
of
the
united
states
controlling
its
entire
operation
and
as
a
representative
of
the
people
seeking
a
just
administration
of
the
law.
this
court
so
fit
not
to
do
so.
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
i
have
some
private--
mr.
harry
n.
rosenfield
it's
not
part
of
the
record
so
i
won't
indicate.
i
do
know
that
the
government
--
the
government
was
sufficiently
interested
to
circulate
all
of
the
departments
of
the
government
in
this
area.
i
--
i'd
rather
not
to
give
further
information
because
it's
not
part
of
the
record,
i
thank
you.
