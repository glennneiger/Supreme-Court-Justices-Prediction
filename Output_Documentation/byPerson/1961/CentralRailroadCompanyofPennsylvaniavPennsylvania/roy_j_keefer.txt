mr.
roy
j.
keefer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
statute
at
issue
in
this
case
imposes
a
tax
on
the
capital
stock
of
corporations
organized
under
the
laws
of
pennsylvania.
it
provides
that
tangible
personal
property
permanently
located
outside
the
state
should
be
excluded
also
exempt
assets
such
as
united
states
securities.
the
tax
has
been
construed
by
the
pennsylvania
courts
and
by
this
court
as
a
property
tax
on
the
assets
of
the
corporation.
this
case
presents
the
validity
of
the
property
tax
assessment
made
by
pennsylvania
upon
the
entire
fleet
of
appellant's
freight
cars
numbering
3074.
the
assessment
included
tax
also
on
all
of
appellant's
locomotives
numbering
30.
the
tax
was
challenged
under
the
due
process
and
commerce
clauses
on
the
ground
that
an
average
number
of
the
locomotives
and
freight
cars
had
acquired
a
situs
outside
the
state
or
were
habitually
and
substantially
employed
outside
the
state
and
therefore,
pennsylvania
lack
power
and
jurisdiction
to
tax
them.
the
tax
was
challenged
also
under
the
equal
protection
clause
on
the
ground
that
the
claim
made
by
appellant
for
exclusion
of
certain
freight
cars
denied
to
it,
was
allowed
to
other
railroads
under
similar
circumstances.
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
dauphin
county
pennsylvania
sustained
the
tax
as
assessed.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
modified
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
by
excluding
from
the
tax
an
average
of
13
locomotives
claimed
by
appellant
to
have
acquired
a
situs
outside
the
state.
but
the
court
sustained
the
tax
on
all
of
appellant's
locomotives
or
all
of
appellant's
freight
cars.
the
tax
on
the
freight
cars
is
here
on
appeal.
appellant,
central
railroad
company
of
pennsylvania
is
a
pennsylvania
corporation,
having
its
nominal
domiciliary
office
at
mauch
chunk,
pennsylvania,
but
having
its
principal
business
operating
office
at
jersey
city,
new
jersey.
the
state
court
reached
the
conclusion
that
all
of
appellant's
freight
cars
had
their
taxable
situs
in
pennsylvania.
now,
since
the
principal
issue
before
this
court
under
the
process
of
commerce
clauses
turns
on
the
determination
of
the
question
of
situs
or
of
the
power
and
jurisdiction
of
pennsylvania
to
tax
is
within
the
province
of
this
court
to
analyze
the
facts
in
order
to
apply
the
law
and
thus
ascertain
whether
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
state
court
can
be
supported.
the
facts
have
been
stipulated
by
the
parties
and
are
not
in
dispute.
however,
they
are
important
and
i
shall
summarize
them
as
briefly
as
possible.
all
of
the
capital
stock
of
appellant
is
owned
by
the
central
railroad
company
of
new
jersey,
which
for
brevity
will
be
referred
to
hereafter
as
cnj.
appellant's
railroad
trackage
of
207
miles
lies
wholly
within
pennsylvania
and
extends
from
scranton
and
wilkes-barre
to
the
pennsylvania,
new
jersey
border
at
easton
where
it
connects
with
railroad
lines
operated
by
cnj
of
new
jersey
to
jersey
city
and
to
points
on
the
north
--
north
jersey
shore.
appellant
and
cnj
share
offices,
officers,
administrative
and
clerical
personnel
at
offices
in
jersey
city,
new
jersey
and
new
york
city.
appellant
conducts
its
railroad
operations
at
and
from
the
jersey
city
office.
these
operations
consist
of
maintenance
and
repair
of
railroad
equipment,
assignment
of
locomotives
to
train
movements,
assignment
of
freight
cars
to
meet
the
demands
of
shippers,
accounting
and
settlement
with
all
carriers
and
with
all
users
of
its
equipment.
there
are
two
separate
and
distinct
types
of
use
of
appellant's
railroad
equipment,
the
one
under
the
operating
agreement
between
appellant
and
cnj
and
the
other,
under
the
car
service
and
per
diem
agreement
of
the
association
of
american
railroads.
first,
the
operating
agreement.
on
august
5,
1946,
central
railroad
--
i'm
sorry,
prior
to
august
5,
1946,
cnj
operated
its
railroad
lines
in
new
jersey
and
it
operated
also
the
railroad
lines
in
pennsylvania
from
easton
to
wilkes-barre
and
scranton.
on
august
5,
1946,
appellant
with
a
consent
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
took
over
the
operation
of
the
railroad
lines
in
pennsylvania
and
entered
into
an
operating
agreement
with
cnj
in
order
to
continue
the
existing
through
freight
and
passenger
service
over
the
respective
lines
of
the
two
companies.
the
agreement
provided
that
each
should
furnish
its
fair
share
of
locomotives
and
equipment
necessary
to
operate
the
through
service.
and
also,
that
whenever
any
unit
of
locomotive
or
other
equipment
of
the
one
party
entered
onto
the
lines
of
the
other
party,
it
should
thereupon
be
temporarily
leased
to
the
other
party
until
returned
--
and
operated
by
the
other
party
until
returned
to
the
owner's
lines.
pursuant
to
disagreement
and
to
the
stipulation
of
the
parties
in
this
case,
appellant's
locomotives
and
freight
cars
in
the
course
of
through
freight
shipments
originating
either
on
its
own
lines
in
pennsylvania
or
on
the
lines
of
cnj
in
new
jersey
run
on
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules
over
the
railroad
lines
of
both
companies.
and
for
that
use,
appellant
received
a
share
of
the
freight
revenue
and
while
its
equipment
was
on
the
lines
of
cnj
in
new
jersey,
it
received
a
mileage
rate
for
its
locomotives
and
a
per
diem
rental
for
its
freight
cars.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
locomotive,
no,
sir.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
there
is
not.
however,
the
state
court
make
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
--
did
make
a
distinction.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
did
make
a
distinction.
i'll
--
i'll
come
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
there
is
no
dis
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
oh,
yes,
one
is
a
mileage
rate
and
the
other
is
a
per
diem
rental,
yes.
now,
the
second
type
of
the
use
of
appellant's
railroad
equipment
is
under
the
car
service
and
per
diem
agreement.
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
of
1920
as
amended,
common
carriers
subject
to
provisions
of
the
act,
including
appellant,
were
required
to
establish
through
routes
and
rates
and
to
interchange
equipment
in
order
to
provide
rapid
and
eficient
through
interstate
movement
of
passengers
and
freight.
the
car
service
and
per
diem
agreement
of
the
association
of
american
railroads
effected
a
large
part,
the
purposes
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
subscribing
members
including
appellant
are
component
parts
of
an
integrated
railroad
system.
they
are
parties
to
through
freight
shipments
extending
beyond
their
own
lines.
the
agreement
provides
for
the
handling
and
use
of
their
equipment
by
other
subscribing
members
until
returned
to
the
owner's
route.
the
owner
is
entitled
to
a
share
in
freight
revenue
on
through
shipments
originating
in
--
and
terminating
on
its
lines
and
to
a
per
diem
rental
of
$1.75
a
day
while
its
equipment
is
off
its
lines
to
destination
point
and
until
the
equipment
has
returned
to
its
route.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
no,
there
is
involved
in
this
one,
your
--
in
the
second
use
only
the
--
only
the
freight
cars.
the
locomotives
are
not
involved
under
the
second
degree.
now,
it
might
be
of
interest
to
point
out
just
here
that
refrigerator
and
tank
cars
owned
by
private
car
companies
and
by
railroads
and
running
on
the
lines
of
railroads
by
--
used
by
shippers
are
also
subject
to
provisions
of
this
agreement.
the
owner
of
such
equipment
receives
the
same
per
diem
rental
of
$1.75
a
day
as
for
freight
cars
or
a
mileage
rate
at
the
option
of
the
owner
who
are
the
controlling
railroad.
now,
appellant's
entire
fleet
of
3074
freight
cars
was
in
general
service
and
will
subject
to
this
agreement.
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
while
off
its
own
lines
in
pennsylvania
and
the
lines
of
cnj
in
new
jersey,
the
freight
cars
were
run
habitually,
regularly
and
continuously
on
the
lines
of
other
railroads
operating
wholly
in
pennsylvania,
operating
within
and
without
pennsylvania
or
operating
wholly
outside
pennsylvania.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
while
appellant's
freight
cars
are
off
its
own
lines
in
pennsylvania
and
of
the
lines
of
central
of
new
jersey
in
new
jersey,
the
cars
are
run
regularly,
habitually
and
continuously
on
the
lines
of
other
railroads
operating
wholly
in
pennsylvania,
operating
within
and
without
pennsylvania
or
operating
wholly
outside
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
your
honor,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
on
the
basis
of
information
in
the
record,
which
i
will
come
to,
the
--
the
record
shows
that
those
cars,
an
average
of
2189
out
of
3074,
were
continuously
outside
of
pennsylvania
throughout
the
entire
year,
an
average
of
2189
or
71%
of
the
total.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
you
are
correct,
your
honor,
and
i'm
going
to
make
that
point
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
sir,
i'm
going
to
make
that
point
in
my
argument
that
the
state
court
and
the
appellee
before
this
court
in
its
brief
has
disregarded
a
vital
stipulated
fact
in
the
case.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
sir.
now,
i
--
i
just
like
to
point
out
what
is
in
the
record.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
from
the
reports
filed
with
appellant
under
the
car
service
and
per
diem
agreement,
the
names
and
locations
of
each
of
the
individual
railroads
on
which
its
cars
were
used
and
a
number
of
days
that
appellant's
cars
were
on
the
lines
of
each
were
included
in
the
record
that
parties
have
stipulate,
that
a
time
and
used
formula
of
car
days
shows
that
an
average
of
2189
of
appellant's
cars
was
continuously
on
the
lines
of
other
railroads
outside
of
pennsylvania
during
the
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
well,
i
think
it's
50a
of
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
it's
5a,
paragraph
15.
but
you
have
to
go
to
the
exhibits,
your
honor
and
figure
up
the
number
of
car
days
that
appellant's
cars
were
outside
of
pennsylvania
in
relation
to
total
car
days
to
get
that
formula
to
which
i
refer.
and
those
are
--
in
those
exhibits
are
y2
and
y3
and
the
page
numbers
are
131a
to
144a.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
yes.
except
this,
your
honor,
that
when
you
come
to
the
railroads
on
which
these
cars
are,
the
railroads
themselves
operating
in
and
out
of
pennsylvania
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
--
the
reports
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
it's
only
when
the
cars
are
on
the
railroad
lines
outside
of
the
state.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
there's
no
dispute,
your
honor,
as
to
the
member
of
car
days
because
that's
a
stipulated
part
of
the
record.
these
exhibits
y2
to
y6
in
the
record
as
to
the
number
of
car
days.
now,
it
is
set
forth
in
the
stipulated
facts
that
a
car
day
ratio
indicates
that
so
many
cars
just
2189
were
on
the
lines
of
railroads
outside
of
pennsylvania,
inferring
that
the
remainder
were
either
on
the
lines
of
central
of
new
jersey
in
new
jersey
or
where
on
railroad
lines
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
sir?
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
may
i
--
may
i
read?
i'm
reading
from
page
50a
and
51a
of
the
record,
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
50a
referring
to
exhibit
y.
this
exhibit
shows,
now
skip
to
subparagraph
(f),
an
allocation
within
and
without
pennsylvania
of
the
freight
cars
on
a
car
day
ratio
basis
thereby
resulting
in
an
allocation
of
so
much
value
to
pennsylvania
and
so
much
value
outside
of
pennsylvania.
all
i've
done
is
converted
that
value
into
number
of
--
of
freight
cars.
and
that
--
that's
what
i
have
done.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
the
only
--
the
only
thing
that
the
state
court
allowed
was
an
average
of
the
13
out
of
30
locomotives
that
were
ran
regularly
on
the
lines
of
central
of
pennsylvania
in
pennsylvania
and
central
of
new
jersey
in
new
jersey.
that's
the
only
thing
that
the
state
court
allowed.it
excluded
that
much
tax
from
the
lower
court's
judgment.
but
it
sustained
the
tax
on
all
of
appellant's
freight
--
the
entire
fleet
of
300
--
3074
including
those
run
regular
--
on
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules
over
its
own
lines
in
pennsylvania
and
the
lines
that
were
--
central
of
new
jersey
in
new
jersey
as
well
as
the
use
of
the
same
fleet
of
cars
on
the
lines
of
other
railroads
under
interchange
all
it
--
at
a
per
diem
rental
of
$1.75
a
day.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
without
any
apportionment.
what
we're
contending
here
is
that
the
state's
sustaining
of
the
other
portion
of
tax
violates
due
process
and
commerce
clause
and
we're
contending
that
apportionment
should
have
been
allowed.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
state
cannot
tax.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
pennsylvania
--
pennsylvania
is
the
state
of
incorporation,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
but
now
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
now,
your
honor,
you
--
i
put
your
finger
on
one
of
the
crucial
points
in
the
case.
and
that
is
that
these
cars
while
on
the
lines
of
other
railroads
outside
of
pennsylvania
were
not
predominantly
on
the
lines
of
railroads
within
a
particular
state
but
on
the
lines
of
railroads
throughout
a
number
of
states.
but
it
is
my
position,
sir,
that
that
still
prevents
pennsylvania
from
levying
an
apportioned
property
tax.
and
i
rely
upon
the
authority
of
this
court
in
standard
oil
company
versus
peck.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
your
honor,
i
have
attached
a
--
an
appendix
b
to
my
brief
if
you
would
return
to
it
--
turn
to
it.
it's
the
last
page
of
the
brief.
and
there
is
listed
the
number
of
borrowing
railroads
which
had
the
--
the
last
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
my
--
my
brief.
appellant's
brief
it
would
be
46.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
there
is
listed
the
names
of
railroads
where
appellant's
cars
were
on
the
lines
of
each
more
than
4000
days.
now,
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
one
particular
one.
look
at
long
island
railroad.
it's
about
--
below
the
middle
of
the
page.
there,
the
number
of
car
days
on
its
lines
was
6872.
now,
on
the
--
on
a
car
day
ratio
basis,
that
is
taking
that
number
of
car
days
over
total
car
days
times
the
value
of
all
freight
cars.
you
come
up
with
a
value
of
freight
cars
of
$62,630.03.
that
represents
18.83
cars.
now,
the
lines
of
long
island
railroad
lay
wholly
within
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
submit
that
under
all
of
the
average
unit
rule
decisions
of
this
court
that
that
average
number
of
18.83
would
have
a
tax
situs
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
thus,
the
state
of
new
york
could
appropriately
levy
a
property
tax
on
them.
now,
one
of
my
principle
points
is
that
if
this
nondomiciliary
states,
any
of
them
or
most
of
them,
have
the
power
to
levy
and
apportion
property
tax
on
these
freight
cars
while
on
the
lines
of
railroads
running
through
their
quarters
or
within
their
territories
and
that
they
can
tax
them.
and
i
submit
that
they
can.
then,
that
existence
of
that
power
of
these
nondomiciliary
states
to
tax
precludes
the
taxation
of
all
of
appellant's
cars
by
pennsylvania,
the
domiciliary
state.
and
that
is
the
whole
point
of
my
case.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
there
must
be
a
contact
with
the
state.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
not
--
not
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
well,
that
--
that
was
before
this
court
in
braniff
airways
versus
nebraska
state
board
in
1954
where
the
planes
were
run
on
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules
into
and
through
nebraska.
and
nebraska,
the
nondomiciliary
state,
levied
an
apportioned
property
tax
upon
the
planes
based
upon
time
of
stops
at
the
airports,
number
of
tons
originating
within
nebraska
or
--
or
delivered
in
nebraska.
they
use
an
apportionment,
a
--
a
formula
to
arrive
at
an
average
number
and
this
court
sustained.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
i
submit
that
it
does,
except
this,
your
honor,
that
our
freight
cars
while
on
the
lines
of
these
other
railroads
are
not
run
on
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules.
but
we
do
have
stipulated
fact
that
they
were
running
regularly,
habitually
and
continuously.
and
that
--
that
kind
of
movement
is
the
very
foundation
of
all
of
the
average
unit
rule
decisions
of
this
court.
and
where
you
have
that
kind
of
a
movement,
the
average
unit
rule
applies
and
being
applicable,
the
domiciliary
state
lacks
the
power
to
impose
an
apportion
property
tax
upon
all
of
the
units
of
transportation
equipment
which
are
used
not
only
within
its
borders
but
are
used
within
the
territories
of
other
states.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
use
in
the
other
states
was
71%
of
total
time
and
total
cars
continuously.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
your
honor
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
your
honor
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
your
honor
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
i
believe
that
this
court
has
not
decided
this
particular
issue
that
is
here
in
this
case.
it
has
decided
cases
involving
pullman
cars
run
on
the
lines
of
railroads
on
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules,
that
was
the
beginning
of
this
average
unit
apportionment
property
taxation
rule.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
no,
no,
your
honor.
now,
that's
just
precisely
what
happens
in
--
in
our
case
here
as
shown
by
this
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
i
believe
--
let
me
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
has
in
this
way.
refrigerator
and
tank
cars
are
used
just
exactly
in
the
same
manner
as
appellant's
freight
cars
are
used
in
this
particular
case.
in
the
refrigerator
car
cases
decided
by
this
court,
american
refrigerator
transit
company
versus
hall,
174
u.s.,
union
refrigerator
transit
company
versus
lynch,
177,
u.s.,
there,
the
facts
were
stipulate
that
the
tank
cars
were
run
indiscriminately
and
where
interchanged
on
the
lines
of
various
railroads.
one
of
the
western
states,
i
believe
it
is
colorado,
levied
an
apportioned
property
tax
upon
an
average
number
of
these
cars
which
it
determined
was
present
within
its
borders
throughout
the
entire
year.
and
it
arrived
at
that
average
number
on
the
basis
of
a
mileage
ratio
of
the
cars
run
in
the
state
to
total
mileage
of
all
cars
run.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
well,
here
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
here
--
here
also,
we're
only
dealing
with
one
year
in
our
particular
case.
but
may
i
go
on
your
honor?
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
the
fact
that
such
cars
were
used
as
vehicles
of
transportation
in
the
interchange
of
interstate
commerce
did
not
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
--
make
their
--
make
the
tax,
the
apportioned
tax
that
was
levied
there
unconstitutional.
so,
in
effect,
this
court
has
decided
that
in
these
interchange
cases
where
the
cars
are
run,
as
it
is
stipulated
in
our
case,
habitually,
regularly
and
continuously
in
any
single
state
if
the
state
by
a
use
of
a
formula
related
in
--
related
to
time
and
use
of
the
property
within
the
state,
if
it
uses
such
a
type
of
formula,
and
comes
up
with
an
average
number
of
cars
that
were
permanently
within
its
borders
throughout
the
entire
year,
it
can
tax
it.
and
that's
why
i
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
new
york
state
in
the
case
of
the
long
island
railway
company
could
tax.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
it
could
be
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree.
it
could
be
if
the
parties
were
to
agree
to
such
a
stipulation.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
it
is.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
didn't
check
into
that.
there
may
be.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
there
may
be.
but
your
honor,
i
--
i
submit
this.
that
any
of
these
nondomiciliary
states
through
which
these
cars
ran
could
obtain
necessary
information
and
data
to
--
to
arrive
at
an
average
number
of
the
cars
that
were
used
within
its
particular
jurisdiction
during
the
year.
and
if
that
data
and
the
application
of
it
produced
an
average
number,
then
i
submit
to
them
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
state
could
tax
it.
and
if
it
can't,
then
i
submit
that
pennsylvania,
the
domiciliary
state,
cannot
levy
an
unapportioned
tax
on
all
of
the
cars.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
on
--
on
a
mileage
basis,
your
honor.
the
mileage
basis
has
been
approved
by
this
court
any
number
of
times
as
a
reasonable
formula
to
determine
use
and
presence
of
units
of
property
within
the
state.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
your
honor,
if
it
is
a
fugitive
presence,
i
would
agree,
but
if
--
as
the
--this
record
shows,
it's
not
a
fugitive
presence.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
yes.
well,
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
same
thing
apply
--
was
applied
by
this
court
to
the
refrigerator
and
tank
cars
which
did
not
run
as
regularly
on
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules
as
the
pullman
cars.
they
ran
indiscriminately
by
--
depending
upon
the
needs
of
shippers
over
the
lines
of
railroads.
and
their
presence
in
any
particular
state
is
just
as
fugitive,
i
submit
your
honor,
as
the
presence
of
the
--
the
freight
cars
of
this
appellant.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
now,
your
honor,
that
case
was
union
refrigerator
transit
company
versus
kentucky
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
--
decided
by
this
court
in
1905.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
but
now
--
not
--
but
now,
this
is
the
way
that
case
arose.
and
i
--
i
must
say
that
the
use
of
this
term
permanently
is
often
misused
in
--
in
not
only
in
the
decisions
but
also
by
some
tax
riders.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
that
case
began
by
an
auditor
of
a
county
bringing
an
action
to
require
the
listing
of
property
by
that
tank
car
company
that
was
present
within
the
predictive
with
--
within
the
state.
and
the
lower
court,
the
county
court
required
the
--
the
company
to
list
for
tax
such
proportion
of
its
cars
as
were
shown
by
a
system
of
gross
earnings
that
were
used
within
the
state
of
kentucky.
now,
--
and
that
--
that
system
actually
was
the
--
was
the
car
hire
gross
earnings
or
ren
--
rental
per
day
for
the
cars
and
that
showed
that
an
only
an
average
of
40
cars
out
of
an
entire
fleet
of
2000
were
on
the
average
within
the
state
of
kentucky,
the
domiciliary
state.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
say
this.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
mr.
chief
justice
stone
in
his
--
a
note
to
his
dissenting
opinion
in
northwest
airlines
referred
to
this
kentucky
case.
and
he
said
there
that
the
tank
car
company
did
not
claim
on
the
record
to
prove
that
any
average
number
of
its
cars
were
in
specific
nondomiciliary
states.
and
he
went
on
to
say
that
since
this
court
limited
the
domiciliary
state
through
an
apportion
tax
that
the
state
--
the
cou
--
this
court
must
have
held
by
the
term
use
of
permanent
without
the
state,
that
it
was
permanent,
they
use
the
term
“permanent”
because
the
cars
on
the
average
were
used
and
employed
outside
the
state,
the
same
average
number.
mr.
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
this
average
unit
rule
decisions
of
this
court
where
you
do
tax
an
average
number
and
you
arrived
at
that
average
number,
the
--
the
unit
shifting,
the
average
number
is
said
to
have
a
permanent
situs
within
the
state.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
it's
--
it's
--
no,
an
average
number
was
permanent
throughout
the
entire
tax
year.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
no
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
your
honor,
i
--
i
submit
this
--
in
this
particular
case.
when
we
start
out
with
a
--
a
time
and
used
formula,
let's
say,
a
car
days.
and
let's
say
that
the
total
car
days
here
were
1,120,000.
now,
take
the
case
of
this
long
island
railroad
company
that
i
have
referred
to.
the
number
of
days
that
appellant's
cars
were
on
its
lines
were
6872.
now,
you
take
that
ratio
for
total
car
days
and
you
get
an
average
number
of
18
cars
that
were
not
present
in
new
york
for
20
days
or
30
days
or
50
days
but
that
is
a
presence
for
an
entire
year.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
correct.
now,
those
--
the
same
18
cars
weren't
there
all
the
time
but
the
units
were
changing
and
there
it
reached
18
words.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
throughout
the
entire
year.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
no,
it
just
this
way,
your
honor.
one
car
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
--
one
car
was
there
365
days.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
okay,
you're
right.
you're
right.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
you're
right.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
maybe
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
maybe
that's
why.
maybe
that's
why
we
haven't
had
tax
cases
often.
they
haven't
caught
up
with,
except
in
this
refrigerator
and
tank
car
cases.
there,
they
do
catch
up
with.
they
require
them
to
--
every
state
through
which
they
are
operated
requires
that
the
tank
car
companies
furnish
information
to
those
states
as
to
the
miles
that
the
car
has
travelled
in
the
states
and
so
forth
and
so
forth.
before
i
--
before
i
forget
it,
i
should
emphasize
one
thing
here,
which
to
my
mind
shows
clearly,
at
least
impart
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
should
be
reversed.
and
that
is
in
connection
with
appellant's
cars
that
are
stipulated
to
have
been
run
under
the
operating
agreement
between
appellant
and
cnj
that
were
run
on
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules
over
appellant's
lines
in
pennsylvania
and
over
the
lines
of
central
of
new
jersey
in
new
jersey.
now,
every
decision
of
this
court
hold
that
in
--
under
such
a
fact,
an
average
number
has
obtained
a
situs
outside
of
the
domiciliary
state.
and
in
this
case,
on
this
car
day
ratio
such
an
average
number
is
158
cars.
and
i
submit
that
at
least
on
that,
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
was
clearly
wrong
and
tax
on
that
number
of
cars,
158,
should
be
excluded
from
the
tax
assessment.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
exactly
so.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
exactly
so,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
sir?
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
they
have.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
but
they
have.
now,
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
leave
that
phase
of
the
case
because
i
think
we've
touched
the
bottom
of
principal
points.
they
remain
to
additional
points
that
i
will
cover
them
quite
briefly.
the
second
point
is
that
appellant's
freight
cars
are
exposed
to
multiple
taxation
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
but
that
point,
it
must
have
necessity
be
based
upon
the
assumption
that
other
states,
nondomiciliary
states,
had
the
power
to
levy
a
property
tax
on
some
of
appellant's
parks.
and
if
it
--
if
--
if
one
or
more
other
states
did
have
such
a
power,
we
submit
that
they
did,
then
the
existence
of
that
power,
even
though
it
was
an
exercise
like
in
new
jersey,
your
honor,
exposes
appellant's
property
to
multiple
taxation
and
that's
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
now,
the
appellee
will
argue
that
multiple
taxation
isn't
involved
because
appellant
hasn't
paid
any
property
tax
on
its
freight
cars
to
any
other
states,
but
we
submit
that
that
isn't
the
test.
the
test
is
not
what
other
states
did
or
did
not
do
but
what
pennsylvania
could
do.
the
last
issue
involves
discrimination
against
appellant.
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
in
--
that
in
assessing
capital
stock
tax
against
railroads
having
trackage
outside
the
state
an
apportionment
was
allowed
to
them
for
their
freight
cars
which
they
owned
while
those
freight
cars
were
on
the
lines
of
other
railroads
outside
of
pennsylvania
under
interchange
just
the
same
as
appellant's.
now,
appellant
contends
that
they
didn't
--
the
denial
of
a
similar
apportionment
to
it
constitutes
discrimination.
the
state
court
denied
discrimination
on
the
ground
that
valid
classification
could
be
made
and
was
made
in
the
statute
between
appellant
having
no
trackage
outside
the
state
and
other
railroads
having
trackage
outside
the
state.
now,
we
submit
that
any
such
classification
is
invalid.
for
example,
if
freight
cars
while
on
the
lines
of
other
railroads
under
per
diem
rental
and
interchange
do
not
acquire
a
situs,
as
the
state
court
held,
apart
from
the
owner's
domicile,
the
domiciliary
state
and
therefore,
the
domiciliary
state
has
constitutional
power
to
levy
an
apportioned
property
tax
upon
all
of
the
freight
cars
then
i
submit
that
the
exercise
of
that
power
against
the
appellant
and
a
failure
to
exercise
it
against
railroads
even
though
they
have
trackage
outside
the
state
constitutes
the
very
essence
of
discrimination
because
even
in
the
case
of
railroads
with
trackage
outside
the
state,
while
their
freight
cars
are
on
the
lines
of
other
railroads,
the
state
--
the
state
court's
decision
said,
“well,
those
didn't
acquire
a
situs
apart
from
the
domicile
of
the
owner
in
pennsylvania.”
well,
now,
if
they
didn't
and
pennsylvania
had
the
power
to
tax
and
didn't
tax
them
then
i
submit
that
the
appellant
is
being
discriminated
begins
because
it's
not
treated
the
same.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
your
honor,
his
dissent
was
directed
more
to
proving
that
there
was
multiple
state
taxation
involved
in
the
northwest
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
it
was.
of
necessity,
he
said
that
unless
you
did
apportion,
you
would
have
multiple
state
taxation.
my
argument
then,
your
honor,
doesn't
differ
much
from
his
except
i
must
admit
that
in
that
case,
there
were
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules.
and
i
think
he
had
a
good
case
for
apportionment
which
this
court
recognized
later
in
braniff
airways
versus
nebraska
state
board
10
years
later
in
1954.
so
i
think
this
court
actually
did
follow
his
argument
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
northwest
case
in
1944.
and
i'm
saying
also,
your
honor,
that
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
distinction
really
between
operation
on
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules
and
a
stipulation
of
facts
that
the
units
of
transportation
equipment
were
run
habitually,
regularly
and
continuously.
to
me,
both
--
they're
both
the
same.
those
are
evidence
of
a
presence
within
the
state.
these
are
domiciliary
or
nondomiciliary.
thank
you.

roy
j.

mr.

(voice

mr.

(voice

a
few
minutes?
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
make
two
points
briefly.
justice
--
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
mr.
keitel
about
the
freight
cars
that
ran
on
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules
over
the
lines
of
appellant
in
pennsylvania
in
central
of
--
of
railroad
in
new
jersey
in
new
jersey's.
and
mr.
keitel
lacks
the
point
that
those
cars
were
not
used
in
central's
--
appellant's
business
while
they're
in
new
jersey.
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference.
they
were
run
on
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules.
the
power
to
levy
a
property
tax
is
based
upon
physical
presence
of
that
property
and
habitual
employment
of
it
within
the
taxing
state,
whether
that
employment
is
by
the
owner
or
another.
now,
certainly,
in
this
particular
case,
these
freight
cars
that
were
run
on
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules
were
employed
in
new
jersey
regularly.
i
would
like
to
devote
the
rest
of
the
time
to
try
and
to
place
the
decision
of
this
court
in
new
york
central
and
the
hudson
river
railroad
company
versus
miller
in
its
proper
perspective.
the
state
court
and
the
appellee,
in
this
case,
disregard
--
just
turn
out
by
disregarding
two
vitally
stipulated
facts.
first,
that
the
cars
were
run
on
routes
--
in
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules
under
the
operating
agreement.
two,
under
the
rental
agreement,
they
were
run
habitually,
regularly
and
continuously.
then
they
--
they
start
out
by
applying
these
descriptive
terms
to
both
the
movement
of
appellant's
cars
under
both
uses.
the
state
court
said
indiscriminate
interchange
with
other
railroads
and
absence
of
fixed
routes
and
regular
schedules,
the
--
the
appellee
describes
the
movement
as
abs
--
temporary
absence
from
the
domiciliary
state.
but
on
the
basis
of
those
descriptive
terms
applied
in
this
case,
they
considered
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
new
york
central
and
hudson
river
case
apply.
now,
in
that
case,
it
is
very
clear
that
this
court
considered
the
movement
of
the
cars
to
be
so
sporadic
and
irregular
that
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
cars
did
not
obtain
a
situs
in
the
other
states.
and
for
that
reason,
they
sustained
the
--
the
unapportioned
property
tax
levied
by
the
domiciliary
state.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
no,
no,
your
honor,
there
was
absence
of
proof
or
absence
of
stipulation
of
facts,
if
you
please,
as
to
continuity
and
regularity
of
movement
of
the
cars
in
the
miller
case.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
and
there
was
--
and
the
--
and
the
taxpayers
submitted
no
proof
on
that
point.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes
--
yes,
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
well,
now,
for
example,
let's
say,
regular
routes,
is
that
what
you
said
sir?
regular
routes?
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
well,
the
route
was
the
lines
of
appellant
in
pennsylvania
and
the
lines
of
central
of
new
jersey
in
new
jersey.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
those
were
the
regular
routes.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes.
but
there
was
an
absence
--
may
--
may
i
go
on
for
just
a
minute?
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
mr.
chief
justice
stone
again
in
his
dissenting
opinion
or
at
least
in
a
note
to
it
in
the
northwest
airlines
case
had
occasion
to
discuss
this
refrigerator
car
case
that
kentucky
decided
in
1905
and
compare
that
with
the
miller
case,
and
he
says
that
his
explanation
of
miller
was
that
there
was
an
absence
of
proof
of
continuity
and
regularity
in
the
miller
case
which
was
present
in
the
northwest
airlines
case
and
which
was
present
in
the
kentucky
tank
car
case
of
1905.
now,
the
--
did
this
court
in
northwest
airlines
applied
the
rule
in
the
miller
case
to
that
case
to
sustain
the
minnesota
on
apportioned
property
tax
on
the
entire
fleet
--
fleet
of
planes
used
in
minnesota
on
700
northwestern
states?
that
was
in
1944.
in
1949,
1952
and
1954,
this
court
very
definitely
holds
that
the
rule
of
the
miller
and
the
northwest
airlines
cases
does
not
apply
to
units
of
transportation
equipment
that
were
run
regularly
and
continuously
to
and
from
and
through
the
domiciliary
state
and
other
states.
as
witness
their
--
this
court's
decision
in
ott
versus
mississippi
valley
barge
line
of
1949,
standard
oil
versus
peck
in
1952
and
braniff
airways
versus
state
board
in
1954.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
airlines?
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
j.
keefer
i
think
the
principles
--
the
principles
of
presence,
habitual
employment,
which
give
--
gives
rise
to
the
power
to
tax,
is
the
same
in
--
in
all
types
of
these
modes
of
--
of
transportation.
now,
the
--
the
state
has
made
another
point
also
that
it
has
referred
to
a
kentucky
case
decided
in
1926.
and
the
--
the
counsel
for
the
commonwealth
has
said
that
the
appellant
hasn't
come
up
with
any
case.
well,
i
--
i
do
have
a
case
and
i
have
cited
it
in
my
brief,
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
in
1959,
whereas
this
kentucky
case
was
decided
in
1926,
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
had
before
it
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
tank
cars
had
a
situs
in
oklahoma
from
which
income
was
earned
that
was
subject
to
tax
by
oklahoma.
well,
the
owner
of
the
tank
cars
was
a
non-resident
and
leased
these
tank
cars
to
railroads
who
in
turn
leased
them
to
shippers.
and
oklahoma
levy
the
incomes
tax
against
the
owner,
the
owner
protested
on
the
ground,
“why
--
why
i
never
used
those
cars.
i
wasn't
doing
business
in
--
in
oklahoma.
the
railroad,
i
leased
them
to
him.
he
leased
them
to
shippers.”
and
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
held
that
“even
though
you're
not
doing
business
in
oklahoma,
an
average
number
of
your
tank
cars
had
a
situs
there
from
which
you
derived
income
which
is
subject
to
the
state
tax.”
so
the
point
of
that
case
is
that
you
can
have
situs
of
property,
an
owner
can
have
situs
of
property
apart
from
his
dom
--
domicile
from
which
he
derives
income
and
his
tax
revolve
in
that
state
where
his
property
is
located
from
which
he
receives
income.
i
think
that
answers,
does
it
your
honors?
thank
you.
