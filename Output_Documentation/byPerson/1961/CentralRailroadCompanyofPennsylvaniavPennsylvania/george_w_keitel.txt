mr.
george
w.
keitel
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
we
could
summarize
the
problem
here
by
saying
this.
the
commonwealth
and
the
courts
below
relied
upon
the
new
york
central
versus
miller
case
and
we
think
that's
controlling
here.
the
taxpayer
contends
that
later
decisions
by
this
court
and
so
modified
the
impact
of
the
new
york
central
case
has
to
set
up
a
different
rule
as
the
domiciliary
taxation
of
freight
cars.
i'd
like
to
point
out
what
i
consider
the
salient
factors
in
this
case.
as
you've
already
heard,
this
is
a
domestic
corporation
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
pennsylvania
for
the
business
of
operating
a
railroad.
it
has
no
tracks
outside
pennsylvania,
operates
no
railroads
and
no
trains
outside
pennsylvania.
when
its
cars
go
outside
pennsylvania,
they
are
not
being
used
in
the
central
railroad
of
pennsylvania's
business
but
they're
being
used
in
the
business
of
another
railroad.
the
central
railroad
of
pennsylvania
is
not
authorized
to
do
business
in
any
other
state.
it
pays
no
corporation
taxes,
privilege,
property
or
otherwise
in
any
other
state.
it
has
the
same
officers
as
cnj
and
these
same
officers
have
filed
reports
in
pennsylvania
where
cnj
does
the
same
thing
as
central
of
pennsylvania
does
in
new
jersey
to
the
effect
that
they're
not
doing
business
here
and
they
are
not
taxed
in
pennsylvania
for
doing
the
converse
of
this
very
same
thing.
in
fact,
pennsylvania
tax
has
no
or
as
of
any
other
railroad,
it
is
not
doing
business
within
the
state.
our
court
has
construed
the
capital
stock
tax
which
is
here
involved
as
being
on
the
actual
failure
of
the
capital
stock
as
represented
by
a
property
and
assets.
this
tax
has
determined
by
fixing
actual
value
under
a
number
of
statutory
factors,
one
being
the
net
worth,
assets
less
liabilities,
one
being
the
earnings,
whether
they
go
into
surplus
or
dividends
and
in
some
instances,
the
market
value
or
the
--
or
the
value
of
the
stock
sales.
now,
the
property
used
in
pennsylvania
in
operation
to
outside
pennsylvania
is
exempt
such
as
u.s.
securities
are
exempt.
this
exemption
is
achieved
by
a
fraction
in
which
the
numerator
contains
all
the
taxable
assets
and
the
denominator
contains
all
the
assets
and
that
is
applied
against
this
value
of
the
capital
stock,
so
that
while
this
is
represented
by
property
in
a
sense,
this
tax
is
actually
on
capital
stock
value
and
not
directly
on
the
property.
this
tax
has
also
been
construed
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
not
opined
to
what
i
would
call
the
“converse
situation”.
a
corporation
having
property
in
pennsylvania
which
is
merely
leased
and
not
operated
by
that
corporation
is
not
subject
to
the
capital
stock
tax,
so
that
this
case
is
consistent
with
prior
rulings
of
our
court
in
saying
that
we
as
a
domicile
can
tax
all
the
property
not
being
operated
outside
the
state
in
business
as
well
as
by
saying,
if
we
do
not
tax,
the
property
of
outside
corporations
which
is
not
being
used
in
pennsylvania
in
their
business.
i
think
you've
recognized
the
alternatives
to
the
position
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
this
railroad
if
--
if
that
position
is
reversed
will
be
subject
to
tax
in
all
48
states
because
its
cars
were
rumbling
around
through
all
48
states.
to
me,
that
is
a
horrendous
alternative
to
this
situation
in
which
we
find
ourselves
here.
this
is
an
exemption
and
it
should
be
strictly
construed
under
both
our
laws
and
the
rules
promulgated
by
this
court.
now,
we
take
the
position
that
pennsylvania
as
a
domiciliary
state
may
tax
all
rolling
stock
unless
that
rolling
stock
has
acquired
a
situs
outside
pennsylvania.
we
contend
that
that
puts
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
taxpayer
to
show
that
there
is
a
tax
situs
acquired
whether
it'd
be
permanent
or
whether
it'd
be
the
type
that
was
discussed
here,
this
afternoon,
a
body
of
cars
continuously
in
one
state.
you
may
recall
that
the
cream
of
wheat
case,
cream
of
wheat
versus
grand
forks
where
this
court
said
that
even
though
the
business
and
property
of
a
corporation
is
outside
the
state,
the
state
of
domicile
can
still
tax
it
and
that
the
only
limitation
imposed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
merely
that
a
state
may
not
tax
a
resident
for
property
which
has
acquired
a
permanent
situs
beyond
its
boundaries.
the
court
went
on
to
say
the
limitation
upon
the
power
of
taxation
does
not
apply
even
the
tangible
personal
property
without
the
state
of
the
corporation's
domicile
if
like
a
seagulling
vessel,
her
property
has
no
permanent
situs
elsewhere
and
anywhere.
and
this
case
was
held
that
there's
still
good
law
and
newark
fire
insurance
company
case
decided
number
of
years
later
in
a
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
joined
him
by
justices
black
and
douglas.
they
assert
in
that
case
the
extent
of
the
state's
taxing
power
over
a
corporation
of
its
own
creation
recognizing
the
cream
of
wheat
case
has
neither
been
restricted
nor
impaired.
that
case
has
not
been
cited
otherwise
than
with
approval.
well,
that
brings
me
to
the
new
york
central
case
and
in
view
of
the
crucial
part
that
case
has
to
play
in
our
position.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
it
in
detail.
the
railroad
involved
there
was
a
domestic
corporation
owning
or
hiring
lines
without
as
well
as
within
the
state,
having
arrangements
with
other
carriers
for
through
transportation,
routing,
and
railing
and
sending
its
cars
to
points
without
as
well
as
within
the
state
and
over
other
lines
as
well
as
on
its
own.
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
202
u.s.
by
mr.
justice
holmes
described
the
business
of
the
railroad
in
these
words
and
noticed
the
similarity
between
justice
holmes'
description
of
their
business
and
the
business
of
this
tax
fair.
the
cars
often
are
out
of
the
relator's
possession
for
some
time,
and
may
be
transferred
to
many
roads
successively
and
even
may
be
used
by
other
roads
for
their
own
independent
business
before
they
return
to
the
relator
or
the
state.
in
short,
by
the
familiar
course
of
railroad
business,
a
considerable
portion
of
the
relator's
cars
constantly
is
out
of
the
state.
and
on
this
ground,
the
relator
contended
that
that
proportion
should
be
deducted
from
its
entire
capital
in
order
to
find
the
capital
--
the
capital
stock
employed
within
the
state,
discontents
and
the
controller
had
disallowed,
and
then
the
proceedings
were
remitted
back
to
him
to
find
whether
any
of
central's
rolling
stock
was
used
exclusively
on
the
state.
“at
the
rehearing,
no
evidence,”
i'm
quoting
now,
“it
was
offered
to
prove
that
any
of
the
relator's
cars
or
engines
were
used
continuously
and
exclusively
outside
the
state
during
the
whole
tax
year.”
the
evidence
did
show
movements
of
particular
cars
in
central
mileage
and
car
mileage
inside
and
outside
the
states
in
order
to
show,
"that
a
certain
proportion
of
cars,
although
not
the
same
cars,
was
continuously
without
the
state
during
the
whole
tax
year.”
that's
precisely
the
situation
we
have
here
with
this
taxpayer.
parenthetically,
it
should
be
noted
that
in
this
case,
we
think
the
appellant
has
offered
no
evidence
as
to
freight
cars
continuously
outside
pennsylvania.
it
relies
on
this
ratio
of
car
days
in
pennsylvania
over
car
days
everywhere
as
a
basis
for
its
allocation
of
freight
cars
in
the
exhibit
y
to
which
mr.
keefer
has
referred.
now,
in
deciding
the
new
york
central
case,
this
court
construed
the
new
york
tax
in
the
same
light
as
our
pennsylvania
capital
stock
tax.
and
this
is
the
language
that
i'd
like
to
refer
to
on
page
596
of
202
u.s.
“it
is
true
that
it
has
been
decided
that
property,
even
of
a
domestic
corporation,
cannot
be
taxed
if
it
is
permanently
out
of
the
state.”
and
for
that,
they
cite
the
union
refrigerator
case,
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
the
delaware,
lackawanna
and
western
case
versus
pennsylvania.
and
i'd
--
i'd
like
the
pause
here
to
point
out
that
this
union
refrigerator
case
preceded
the
new
york
central
decision.
the
new
york
central
decision
came
afterward
and
the
unsuccessful
party
in
that
case
cited
these
refrigerator
cases
in
support
of
his
position
to
no
avail.
resuming
the
quote,
"but
it
has
not
been
decided,
and
it
could
not
be
decided,
that
a
state
may
not
tax
its
own
corporations
for
all
their
property
within
the
state
during
the
tax
year,
even
if
every
item
of
that
property
should
be
taken
successively
into
another
state
for
a
day,
a
week
or
six
months
and
then
brought
back,
using
the
language
of
domicile,
which
now
so
frequently
has
applied
to
inanimate
things,
the
state
of
origin
remains
the
permanent
--
permanent
situs
of
the
property,
notwithstanding
its
occasional
excursions
to
foreign
parts.”
in
the
present
case,
it
does
not
appear
that
any
specific
cars
or
any
average
of
cars
was
so
continuously
in
any
other
state
to
be
taxable
there.
the
absences
relied
on
were
not
in
the
course
of
travel
upon
fixed
routes
but
random
excursions
of
casually
chosen
cars
determined
by
the
varying
orders
of
particular
shippers
and
the
arbitrary
convenience
of
other
roads.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
they
need
not
consider
the
parallelism
between
liability
elsewhere
and
immunity
at
home.
well,
this
case
was
followed
by
the
northwest
airlines
case
where
the
state
of
minnesota
was
permitted
to
tax
in
full
of
fleet
of
airplanes.
and
then
by
the
standard
oil
versus
peck
case,
the
decision
--
the
majority
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
douglas
and
it's
my
impression
that
the
taxpayer
here
is
contending
that
the
standard
oil
versus
peck
case
rendered
obsolete
these
earlier
decisions
and
would
require
pennsylvania
to
apportion
these
freight
cars
that
are
going
around
in
other
states.
but
if
you
study
the
decision
in
the
--
in
the
standard
oil
versus
peck
case,
you'll
find
an
entirely
different
situation.
there,
the
standard
oil
company
was
operating
in
its
barges
in
tennessee,
indiana,
kentucky
and
louisiana.
they
did
not
operate
them
at
all
in
ohio
which
was
a
state
attempting
to
tax
them.
the
only
time
these
barges
came
in
to
ohio
was
to
go
to
cincinnati
to
get
some
repairs
and
maintenance.
and
for
17.5
miles
trip
of
water
that
they
had
to
pass
through
in
order
to
get
to
one
of
the
kentucky
ports
across
the
river.
so
that,
here
you
have
a
case
where
the
barges
of
the
company
was
operating
on
were
never
--
never
in
the
domiciliary
state.
that's
one
main
distinction
here.
here,
all
of
these
cars
are
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
sometime
around
or
other,
they
have
to
start
there
and
they
have
to
go
back.
under
this
car
hire
agreement
between
the
railroads,
there's
an
obligation
to
route
them
back
at
--
in
a
convenient
manner
and
we've
printed
some
of
that
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
to
show
some
of
those
provisions.
the
second
important
difference
is,
and
this
is
a
difference
that
applies
to
practically
all
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
appellant,
in
the
standard
oil
versus
peck
case,
the
taxpayer
was
operating
the
barges.
it
was
his
business.
he
was
doing
business
in
four
other
states,
namely,
operating
his
barges.
that's
true
also
of
the
airlines
cases.
it's
also
true
of
the
refrigerator
and
the
pullman
cases.
because
in
those
cases,
the
pullman
company
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
furnishing
pullman
service
and
they're
doing
that
business
when
they
put
their
cars
on
a
train.
the
tank
line
companies
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
leasing
tank
cars.
and
when
they
lease
tank
cars
to
the
different
states,
different
people
who
rent
them,
they
are
doing
business,
the
tank
car
business.
but
in
this
particular
case,
when
these
cars
were
sent
out
on
these
other
railroads,
it's
not
in
further
into
the
business
of
the
taxpayer
but
it's
in
the
--
in
somebody
else's
business,
some
other
railroads
business
that
these
cars
are
being
used.
i
think
that's
a
basic
--
an
essential
distinction.
now,
there
have
been
no
decisions
of
this
court
on
this
point
but
i
do
have
one
case
in
the
state
of
kentucky
where
they
caught
up
with
this
situation
and
tried
to
tax
the
union
pacific
railroad.
state
of
kentucky
imposed
a
property
tax
and
a
franchise
tax
on
the
union
pacific
railroad
for
its
freight
cars
which
were
going
through
the
state
under
these
car
hire
agreements.
now,
this
was
a
lower
court
case,
but
it's
the
only
case
that
i
could
find
and
--
and
its
one
more
case
than
the
counsel
for
the
appellant
could
find.
and
i
think
that
it's
significant
because
it
shows
the
thinking
of
at
least
one
court
and
explains
perhaps
the
reason
why
the
states
have
not
tried
to
tax
these
roaming
freight
cars.
after
discussing
the
tank
line
and
the
tank
car
and
the
refrigerator
cases,
the
kentucky
court
said
this,
"a
railroad
freight
car,
however,
is
primarily
designed
for
the
use
of
the
owning
carrier
on
its
own
line.
it
is
not
sent
by
its
owner
on
for
the
line
of
another
carrier
in
the
prosecution
of
its
owner's
business
which
is
to
carry
freight
on
the
line
of
such
owner.
it
is
sent
on
to
the
line
of
the
connecting
carrier
for
the
convenience
of
the
shipper,
and
because
the
united
states
government
requires
railroads
to
do
so
and
through
routing.
the
tank
line
and
like
companies
received
a
substantial
profit
from
the
use
of
their
cars
within
the
foreign
states
or
at
least
their
cars
are
so
employed
or
used
in
an
effort
to
make
such
a
profit.
but
the
railroads
do
not
send
their
cars
into
other
states
in
an
effort
to
make
any
profit
from
them
while
there.
the
foreign
railroads
are
not
doing
business
in
such
states.
these
are
tank
line
and
like
companies.
although
the
freight
cars
of
the
foreign
railroads
are
present
in
this
state
form
time
to
time,
that
each
one
is
but
temporarily
so
in
the
cohesive
principle
which
brings
changing
units
together
to
form
a
whole
which
may
be
taxed.
that
is
the
use
an
employment
of
them
together
as
a
whole
by
the
owner
in
the
prosecution
of
some
purpose
of
his,
usually
business
is
absent.”
mr.
george
w.
keitel
the
--
the
--
mr.
george
w.
keitel
it's
commonwealth
of
kentucky
versus
union
pacific
railroad.
it's
in
--
you'll
find
it
on
--
in
my
brief.
i've
quoted
--
i
read
part
of
the
quote
that
i
have
in
my
brief
from
that.
so
you
see
--
if
you
look
at
the
reverse
side
of
the
coin
as
to
what
powers
these
other
states
might
have
in
taxing,
you'll
find
one
state
already
has
rejected
that
possibility.
and
we
think
that
it
stems
back
to
the
central
rail
or
the
new
york
central
versus
miller
case
which
certainly
holds
that
these
railroad
cars
are
taxable
at
the
domicile
of
the
owner.
now,
one
of
the
contentions
has
to
do
with
standard
oil
versus
peck
that
i
mentioned
a
minute
ago.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
court
in
deciding
standard
oil
versus
peck
did
not
overrule
the
new
york
central
case.
this
is
what
they
said
about
it.
new
york
ex
rel.
so
forth
versus
miller,
“sustained
a
tax
by
domiciliary
state
on
all
rolling
stock
of
a
railroad.”
but
in
that
case,
it
did
not
appear
that,
“any
specific
cars
or
any
average
of
cars”
was
so
continuously
in
another
state
as
to
be
taxable
there.
then
in
northwest
airlines
cases,
the
decision
is
mentioned
and
a
similar
statement
made
about
that.
then
justice
douglas
states,
“those
cases,
though
exceptional
along
their
facts,
though
a
straight,
the
reach
of
the
taxing
power
of
the
state
of
the
domicile
is
contrasted
to
that
of
the
other
states.”
but
they
have
no
application
here,
why?
since
most,
if
not
all,
of
the
barges
and
boats
which
ohio
has
taxed
were
almost
continuously
outside
ohio
during
the
taxable
year.
and
i
think
that
made
a
great
difference
in
that
case.
we
also,
of
course,
have
the
obligation
to
--
to
--
for
interstate
commerce
purposes
of
apportioning
tax
values.
but
here,
it's
our
position
that
there
is
no
interstate
commerce
because
this
railroad
doesn't
operate.
it's
aligned
outside,
that
kind
of
interstate
commerce
that
will
require
this
kind
of
apportionment
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
pays
no
taxes
and
we
think
we'll
not
have
to
pay
any
taxes
in
the
future.
mr.
george
w.
keitel
of
course,
we
contended
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
that
they
were
--
they
were
all
taxable
in
pennsylvania.
and
our
reasons
for
that
were
--
that
these
trains,
when
they
cross
in
new
jersey
were
operated
entirely
by
the
center
railroad
in
new
jersey.
this
was
a
no
sense
on
operation
by
the
central
railroad
of
pennsylvania.
and
if
you
--
if
you
read
the
operating
agreement,
that
is
very
clear
because
of
responsibility
for
the
equipment
and
the
personnel,
the
passengers
and
freight
is
all
assumed
by
the
--
by
the
other
company,
the
company
that's
actually
operating
the
train.
and
when
you're
in
new
jersey,
it's
the
cnj
that's
operating
the
train.
now,
it
was
our
--
our
position
--
another
interesting
thing
about
it
is
that
the
--
this
locomotive
rental
was
determined
by
the
--
the
depreciated
value
of
a
locomotive
and
they
added
five
mills
to
pay
for
the
tax
which
is
what
our
pennsylvania
tax
is.
so
that,
we
contend
that
the
central
railroad
in
new
jersey,
when
they
paid
the
rental
to
pennsylvania
was
actually
not
only
paying
rental
but
they
were
paying
the
five
mills
tax
that
--
that
they
were
trying
to
get
here.
but
as
to
the
freight
cars
themselves,
if
you
examine
the
operating
agreement,
you'll
find
that
the
freight
cars
come
under
this
car
hire
agreement
with
the
other
26
railroads.
and
i
--
i
think
it's
pretty
naïve
to
assume
that
all
the
freight
cars
of
central
railroad
of
pennsylvania
run
back
and
forth
like
the
diesel
locomotives
do.
i
would
think
that
a
lot
of
these
freight
cars
would
be
consigned
for
new
england
or
some
place
else.
mr.
george
w.
keitel
they
took
the
mileage
in
--
mr.
george
w.
keitel
--
they
took
a
mileage
average
--
mr.
george
w.
keitel
--
in
pennsylvania
as
against
the
new
jersey.
now,
i'm
sure
that
these
freight
cars
could
go
all
over.
they
don't
just
come
running
back
and
forth,
and
we
may
have
been
mouse
trapped
on
the
stipulation
here
in
agreeing
that
they
were
used
on
fixed
routes.
then
i
think
that
the
fact
that
their
car
hire
agreement
applies
makes
a
difference.
of
course,
he
probably
sensed
that
i
feel
that
our
court
was
wrong
in
drawing
that
--
mr.
george
w.
keitel
and
we
--
we
haven't
appealed
and
--
mr.
george
w.
keitel
--
and
we're
--
but
we're
--
we
like
the
right
to
use
the
argument
here
to
sustain
what
the
court
did
decide.
now,
on
the
stipulation
of
the
facts,
we
did
agree
with
the
taxpayer
that
these
cars
are
used
habitually
and/or
continuously
on
other
railroads.
well,
that's
merely
an
agreement
that
the
car
hire
agreement
is
--
applies
to
these
freight
cars.
when
you
get
to
examine
the
figures
in,
we're
entirely
in
disagreement
as
to
what
those
figures
mean.
i've
given
a
--
a
number
of
examples
in
my
brief
as
to
how
these
figures
add
up
to
almost
nothing.
example
number
one,
there
are
345
railroads
involved
here.
53.8%
of
the
total
car
days
were
on
the
306
railroads
which
are
entirely
outside
of
pennsylvania.
if
every
one
of
those
cars
was
on
every
one
of
those
railroads,
they'd
be
on
six
tenths
of
1%
days
per
year
per
railroad.
the
same
--
similar
thing
is
true
on
the
railroads
in
and
out
of
pennsylvania.
so
that
--
taking
the
most
favorable
position
toward
the
taxpayer
on
these
figures,
the
cars
are
more
than
seven
times
in
--
in
pennsylvania,
more
than
seven
times
longer
than
they
are
in
any
other
railroad.
another
example
is
the
--
the
one
that
was
mentioned
impart
here
of
the
car
hire
days.
the
average
is
1979
days
per
year
per
railroad.
that
could
mean
either
six
cars
for
a
full
year
or
1979
cars
for
one
day.
we
don't
know
what
these
figures
mean.
they're
just
averages.
and
on
some
of
the
tables
that
are
offered,
the
number
of
cars
on
the
appellant's
own
railroad
had
been
omitted.
so
we
--
we
contend
that
these
figures
do
not
sustain
their
burden
of
proof.
and
assuming
that
they
would
have
a
basis,
a
legal
basis
for
allocating
these
cars
outside
pennsylvania,
they
can't
sustain
that
burden
by
showing
that
they're
on
some
other
railroads.
it
seems
to
me
that
they
should
have
the
same
burden
to
show
us
that
they're
taxable
in
california,
let's
say,
as
california
would
have
to
show
their
court
that
they
are
taxable
there.
taxable
situs
to
me
means
enough
of
a
situs
to
enable
the
--
some
state
to
tax.
all
these
figures
show
is
that
a
certain
average
number
of
car
days
were
spent
on
--
on
345
different
railroads.
there's
nothing
fixed.
there's
no
--
no
such
thing
as
fixed
routes
here
because
a
shipment
might
go
out
one
day
to
california
and
there
may
not
be
anymore
for
--
for
six
months.
there's
no
regularity
here
of
anything
except
the
regularity
of
the
application
of
the
car
hire
agreement.
speaking
briefly
about
our
lack
of
equal
protection,
as
your
honors
probably
recall,
there
are
different
kinds
of
railroads,
there
are
some
that
have
multiple
domiciles.
there
are
four
or
five
operating
in
pennsylvania
in
that
category.
and
as
to
them
of
course,
we
--
we
give
a
complete
allocation
by
miles
--
by
miles
in
pennsylvania
over
total
miles.
we
have
to
because
that's
in
accordance
with
our
concept
that
the
domicile
is
the
place
where
the
tax
situs
rests.
there
are
some
railroads,
however,
that
are
domicile
in
pennsylvania
that
have
tracks
outside
of
pennsylvania.
and
it's
true
that
for
this
year
1951,
there
--
in
some
of
those
cases,
there
were
freight
cars
off
the
system,
you
might
say,
which
did
--
which
did
not
get
allocated
100%
in
pennsylvania.
now,
as
to
those
railroads,
this
--
this
failure
to
make
this
allocation
was
due
to
the
fact
that
they
were
reported.
there
was
no
distinction
made
in
the
reporting
of
the
railroads.
and
if
there
was
any
discrimination,
which
we
don't
believe
there
was,
but
if
there
was
any,
it
was
because
of
the
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
taxing
officers
and
not
because
of
any
policy
which
--
which
discriminated
against
the
--
the
--
this
railroad
and
in
favor
of
other
railroads.
we
were
not
in
a
position
to
give
this
railroad
an
allocation
because
it
has
no
tracks
outside
pennsylvania
and
we
think
that
we've
satisfied
the
equal
protection
clause
in
this
respect.
let
me
close
by
summarizing
in
saying
that
we
think
that
the
central
railroad
case
controls
this
case.
we
think
it's
still
good
law
as
it
applies
to
meandering
freight
cars
and
that
the
alternative
to
our
position
convey
the
taxation
of
railroads
like
this
in
48
states.
a
thing
which
i
don't
believe
the
railroads
would
really
appreciate
because
well,
their
--
well,
their
taxes
might
not
go
up
much.
they
would
be
subject
to
a
very
unfavorable
tax
situation.
thank
you.
