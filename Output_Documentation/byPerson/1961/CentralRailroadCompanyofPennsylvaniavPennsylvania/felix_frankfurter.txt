justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
that
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
stipulation
neither
explicitly
nor
by
implication
indicates
that
these
freight
cars
operated
continuously,
wholly
for
a
predominant
part
of
the
year
continuously
outside
of
pennsylvania
line,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
statement
is
in
conflict
with
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
conclusion
of
the
question
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
turning
point
on
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
take
your
own
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
stipulation?
turn
to
that
quickly.
no
if
it
takes
anytime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
volume
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
do
--
did
i
--
do
i
correctly
under
--
did
i
correctly
comprehend
or
apprehend
or
both
that
as
to
each
car,
there's
the
record
kept.
each
car
has
a
label,
has
a
--
has
a
number
or
a
--
or
letter
and
as
to
each
car,
there
is
a
record
and
one
can
tell
from
those
records
what
car
as
to
what
extent
in
home
territory,
by
home
i
mean
pennsylvania,
and
to
what
extent
outside
so
that
one
can
tell
or
is
this
true,
that
in
capable
of
mathematical
demonstration,
how
many
of
these
cars
are
more
than
180
odd
days,
83
days
outside
of
pennsylvania.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
then
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
catch
of
the
thing,
if
--
if
these
railroads,
if
these
farm
railroads
so-called
meaning,
not
the
railroads
that
own
cars
also
operate
within
--
within
pennsylvania.
the
fact
that
these
cars
are
used
on
other
roads
on
your
own
doesn't
make
any
difference
so
far
as
the
taxing
part
is
concern.
suppose
your
cars
used
300
days
of
the
year,
in
pennsylvania,
you
do
not
on
your
roads,
does
that
--
does
that
precludes
pennsylvania
from
taxing
them
against
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
geographical
question,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
couldn't
be
agreed
between
the
parties
of
this
--
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
see
if
there
was
agreement
between
the
parties
on
this
point,
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
should
have
gone
wrong.
on
your
view,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
rested
its
decision
on
an
inaccuracy,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
supreme
court
--
the
--
the
judgment
from
which
you're
appealing
rested
on
an
assumption
which
from
--
on
a
mathematical
assumption
which
from
your
point
of
view
is
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i'm
a
little
troubled
to
have
your
answer,
justice
harlan
does
not
that
there
was
agreement
between
the
parties
in
to
the
fact.
why
does
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
go
wrong
if
there
was
agreement
between
the
parties?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this
case.
i
accept
i
start
with
miller,
new
york
--
new
york
against
miller.
i
accept
that.
now,
if
a
state
made
tax
in
cars
of
impugnable
goods,
if
--
if
the
cars
spend
most
of
their
time
during
a
taxing
year
within
a
state,
the
state
made
tax
for
the
value
of
those
cars,
if
railroads
cars
are
predominantly
for
most
of
the
years
spent
in
a
--
in
another
state,
in
a
single
state
outside
of
--
of
the
taxing
state,
a
state
can
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
cannot
tax
at
miller.
now,
then,
take
the
case,
take
the
situation
put
by
justice
harlan.
suppose
the
cars
spend
most
of
their
time
outside
of
the
taxing
state
but
do
not
spend
most
of
their
time
in
any
other
single
state
outside
of
the
taxing
state,
that
raises
a
different
so
that
there
is
no
permanence
of
taxing
purposes
in
anyone's
states,
that
raises
a
different
question
which
certainly
wouldn't
allow
the
state
like
pennsylvania
to
tax
so
it
may
well
allow
the
state
of
incorporation
tax.
i'm
not
saying
it
would.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
do
you
--
pennsylvania
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
ground
in
which
the
tax
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
otherwise,
if
that
were
not
so,
then
cars
that
do
not
spend
the
major
part
of
the
year
in
any
particular
state
would
be
tax-free.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
any
--
any
of
the
--
could
any
of
the
states
of
--
of
the
borrowed
lines
taxed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
one-third
of
the
year,
for
one-fifth
of
the
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
54,
alright.
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
--
have
this
court
decided,
i
ought
to
know
but
i
don't
--
this
court
decided
that
any
state
in
which
cars
running
in
interstate
commerce
run
in
a
state
for
a
fraction
of
a
year
are
subject
to
the
property
tax
for
that
year?
have
we
decided
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
your
argument
as
you've
stated
in
a
minute
ago
rest
on
the
assumption
that
that
can
be
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
you're
trying
to
oust
pennsylvania
of
its
power
by
saying
the
other
states'
habits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
queerly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
those
were
the
cases
where
this
court
said
so
long
as
cars,
cars,
platonic
cars
are
in
the
state
throughout
the
state,
they
didn't
have
to
be
the
same
cars.that
conveys
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
have
you
decided
that
--
that
new
york
would
have
this
long
island
railroad
use
of
your
car?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
use
--
during
the
year
was
the
standard
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
calculation
was
on
the
basis
of
a
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
keefer,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
a
stipulation
such
as
you
have
here
could
be
made
in
relation
to
practically
every
carrier
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
because
these
cars
move
outside
the
state
often
every
state?
very
--
am
i
not
right
about
that?
that
this
such
a
stipulation
is
--
is
why
it
could
be
made
for
practically
every
carrier
except
--
except
the
wholly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--intrastate
carrier
like
the
long
island
railroad?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean,
such
as
the
transportation
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
mileage
tax
that
have
been
used
as
a
mean
of
ascertaining
what
has
not
--
but
if
not
a
fictive
matter,
namely,
of
concluding
that
for
practical
purposes,
the
cars
are
in
their
state
during
the
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
that
a
fugitive
presence
in
a
state
gives
the
state
the
taxing
power
over
instrumentality
with
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
fugitive
i
mean
non-permanence
that
the
unit
cases
or
varied
case,
the
railroad
cases,
the
pullman
cases
etcetera,
they
all
rested
on
the
assumption
that
since
you're
dealing
with
movables
and
since
these
are
fungible
good,
one
car
is
no
different
from
another
car
so
far
as
protection
of
the
state,
state's
government
is
concerned,
if
cars
moving
in
and
out,
moving
in
and
out,
moving
in
and
out,
they're
deemed,
for
all
practical
purposes,
of
what
the
state
gives
to
be
in
the
same
situation
as
the
depot
--
as
the
real
property
of
the
railroad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
help
me
out,
somewhere
around
199
u.s.
that
this
court
for
the
first
time
decided
over
a
short
pungent
expression
of
mr.
justice
holmes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
domiciliary
state
cannot
tax
all
the
rolling
stock
of
a
tank
company
or
railroad
company
if,
if,
a
big
if,
if
as
to
the
portion
with
this
permanently
outside
the
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
kentucky.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
it
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
amount
of
judges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
permanent
for
whatever
period
of
time
expands?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
little
too
difficult
for
me
to
comprehend.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
turns
out
that
cars
by
whatever
--
by
whatever
formula
you're
arriving
has
been
in
the
state
only
for
23
days.
it's
23
permanent
for
purposes
of
our
decisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
to
say
that
justice
holmes
assumed
that
somebody
ran
a
car
out
once
in
while
on
the
--
on
st.patrick's
day
or
on
columbus
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
new
york
central
counsel
or
very
able
counsel
and
they
didn't
think
it's
necessary
to
prove
that
--
that
cars
of
the
new
york
central
are
all
over
the
place,
not
just
error
in
cars,
took
a
joyride.
almost
--
when
you
say
regular
routes
means
a
car
run
on
tracks,
does
it
mean
much
more
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
cars
don't
have
a
--
they're
engaged
in
railroading
and
railroading
means
carrying
things
of
passengers
from
place-to-place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
--
that's
what
your
stipulation
says
and
i
was
wondering
what
that
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
based
in
your
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
and
in
the
central
case,
justice
holmes
said
he
wouldn't
care
what
was
the
fact,
doubtless
of
fact
that
many
of
the
new
york
central
cars
were
outside
the
state
for
six
months
of
a
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
airlines
and
ships
are
all
the
same
as
railroads?
justice
felix
frankfurter
airlines
and
ships?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
they're
all
the
same
for
tax
purposes?
