well,
mr.
feller
you
say
301
says
nothing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
--
it
doesn't
say
quite
that
way
does
it?
i
remember
in
the
clayton
act
case,
the
statute
said,
shall
be
entitled
to
sue
in
any
court
of
the
united
states
and
this
court
said
in
one
sentence
that
that
was
the
over
term
which
show
that
the
right
was
to
be
exercised
quote,
“only
in
the
court
of
united
states.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
this
statute
says,
may
be
brought
in
any
district
court
of
united
states
as
if
there
is
much
of
an
inference
there
as
there
was
in
the
clayton
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
in
that
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
court
can
say
so
in
that
opinion.
