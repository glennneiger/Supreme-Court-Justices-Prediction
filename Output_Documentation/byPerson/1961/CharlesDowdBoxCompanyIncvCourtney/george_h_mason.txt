mr.
george
h.
mason
may
it
please
the
court.
the
federal
law
here
involved
is
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act
with
the
subject
of
consideration
by
this
court
in
lincoln
mills
in
1957.
the
principal
issue
presented
here
is
whether
section
301
preempted
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
that
field
of
litigation
involving
collective
bargaining
contracts
where
interstate
commerce
would
be
effective.
the
case
comes
here
in
the
following
manner.
i
shall
refer
to
the
petitioner
here,
the
defendant
in
the
lower
court
action
of
the
company
and
the
respondent
here
is
the
union
for
convenience.
the
union
brought
a
suit
to
the
massachusetts
court
to
enforce
an
alleged
collective
bargaining
agreement
essentially
claiming
a
refusal
by
the
company
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
an
executed
agreement,
allegedly
executed
agreement,
an
improper
termination
of
that
contract
by
the
company
and
sought
as
relief
an
injunction
against
the
termination
of
the
contract
by
the
company,
specific
performance
of
the
entire
agreement,
a
declaratory
judgment
and
damages
for
the
violation
of
the
contract.
the
action
was
brought
by
the
union
--
international
union,
united
steelworkers
of
america
through
a
representative
of
the
international
by
the
local
charted
by
the
international.
on
behalf
of
the
organizations
themselves
and
of
the
individual
members
of
those
organizations
--
for
the
action
can
only
be
instituted
as
a
class
suit
in
massachusetts,
so
which
does
not
recognize
at
the
end
of
the
theory
with
reference
to
unincorporated
organization
such
as
labor
unions.
the
company
filed
a
demurrer
in
the
action
setting
up
specifically
that
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act
deprived
the
state
court
of
jurisdiction
in
a
suit
between
a
labor
organization
and
an
employer
for
violation
of
a
collective
contract.
the
company
incidentally
denied
the
validity
of
the
agreement
that
was
in
issue
and
determined
adversely
to
the
company.
mr.
george
h.
mason
of
the
collective
agreement
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
of
the
whole
agreement.
mr.
george
h.
mason
that
was
one
of
the
defenses
raised
by
the
company
as
to
the
invalidity
of
the
--
with
reference
to
the
validity
of
the
collective
agreement.
the
company
also
filed
a
motion
at
some
stage
in
the
proceedings
to
dismiss
the
action
for
want
of
jurisdiction
alleging
the
same
ground
as
it
did
in
the
demurrer.
the
demurrer
and
the
motion
was
--
the
demurrer
was
overruled
and
motion
was
denied
by
the
lower
court.
a
filed
decree
was
entered
in
the
lower
court
declaring
the
agreement
valid
and
binding
on
the
parties
and
directing
payment
of
specific
amounts
to
individual
members
of
the
union
in
the
form
of
wages
alleged
to
be
due
under
this
contract.
now,
i
might
point
out
here
that
the
original
action
sought
specific
performance
of
the
entire
contracts
which
had
many
clauses
in
it
--
with
reference
to
union
rights
qua
union
such
as
recognition
of
the
union,
union
shop,
check
off,
as
well
as
claiming
violation
of
rights
which
would
result
in
money
damages
to
the
individual
members
for
wages
alleged
to
be
due.
but
the
--
by
the
time
the
filed
decree
was
entered
in
1960,
the
original
contract
had
expired,
so
that
the
question
of
specific
performance
of
the
expired
contracts
had
become
moot
and
the
only
relief
therefore
which
the
court
afforded
to
the
union
was
to
grant
the
money
damages
which
was
alleged
to
be
due
under
that
expired
contract
or
the
duration
of
that
contract.
the
company
appealed
from
the
interlocutory
decrees
--
decree
overruling
the
demurrer
of
the
company
in
which
it
alleged
no
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
and
from
the
lower
court's
motion
to
--
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction
and
from
the
final
decree,
the
supreme
judicial
court
affirmed
the
rulings
of
the
lower
court
in
essence
holding
that
the
state
court
did
have
jurisdiction,
not
withstanding
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act
that
the
taft-hartley
--
the
three
--
section
301
did
not
establish
any
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts.
now,
it
may
be
of
interest
on
the
--
as
the
case
arises
here
that
in
the
findings
of
fact
which
are
undisputed
now
in
this
case,
there
was
a
finding
in
the
lower
court
that
the
company
sells
a
substantial
part
of
its
product
and
purchases
a
substantial
part
of
its
supplies
in
interstate
commerce.
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
here
of
whether
the
case
involves
one
affecting
the
interstate
commerce.
i
think
that
would
be
considered
by
both
parties.
it
found
that
the
company
refused
to
comply
with
the
contract
and
terminated
it
before
its
expiration
date,
and
that
the
collective
agreement
for
which
specific
performance
was
requested,
was
valid
and
contained
the
usual
clauses
which
are
incorporated
in
a
collective
agreement
so
that
the
case
is
one
to
which
section
301
obviously
applies.
it
was
brought
by
a
labor
organization
against
an
employer
for
a
violation
of
a
contract
between
these
parties
expressly.
the
company
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
i
think
that's
undisputed
so
that
this
would
affect
interstate
commerce
suit
conceivably
and
the
suit
sought
specific
performance
of
the
entire
contract
so
that
it
could
not
be
said
that
this
was
a
suit
to
maintain
or
prosecute
uniquely
personal
rights
as
distinguished
from
rights
of
the
union
as
a
union,
so
that
the
westinghouse
problem
is
not
yet
present.
i
think
it
was
not
specifically
that
will
force
money
judgments
for
individual
members
of
the
union
although
that
was
the
final
decree
entered
because
the
other
issues
had
become
moot
in
the
process
of
the
litigation.
now,
the
section
301
and
the
inquiry
i
should
say
here
presented
follows
in
somewhat
natural
sequence
from
the
court's
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
lincoln
mills
case,
in
mills'
case
in
1957
where
at
least
these
phases
of
section
301
were
determined
namely
that
section
301
was
not
a
procedural
statute,
but
created
substantive
rights
and
established
substantive
law,
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
it
did
--
created
a
direction
to
the
federal
courts
to
fashion
a
body
of
federal
law
under
section
301.
and
the
case
further,
i
think
for
our
purposes
in
this
situation
established
that
there
were
no
constitutional
difficulties
involved
in
the
enactment
of
section
301
granting
remedies
or
establishing
a
procedure
for
remedies
for
violation
of
collective
agreements
which
were
consummated
between
labor
organizations
and
employers.
now
i
think
that
being
in
the
sense
behind
this
as
far
as
the
issues
in
this
case
are
concerned
we
come
then
to
the
question
--
the
next
question
in
sort
of
a
logical
sequence,
if
section
301
established
the
substantive
law
beyond
a
mere
procedural
enactment,
permitting
a
forum
for
enforcement
of
collective
contracts
in
the
federal
courts
and
if
this
was
constitutionally
within
the
province
of
congress
to
so
enact
in
establishing
a
national
labor
policy,
then
i
think
it
must
be
assumed
that
there
–
if
there
is
no
constitutional
impediment
to
the
interpretation
and
application
of
section
301
as
set
forth
in
the
lincoln
mills
case,
then
it
must
be
assumed,
i
submit,
that
it
was
within
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
have
granted
exclusive
jurisdiction
for
the
enforcement
of
these
rights
to
the
federal
courts
if
it
so
fit
which
would
then
bring
us
to
the
customary
but
often
difficult
question
of
proving
the
legislative
intent
in
this
respect.
then
it
becomes
in
this
case
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
section
301
as
to
whether
congress
intended
or
the
general
pattern
of
this
legislation
and
the
general
purpose
of
it
would
require
an
interpretation
fairly
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
vested
in
the
federal
courts
when
section
301
was
enacted.
it
might
be
helpful
to
orient
ourselves
to
read
the
specific
provision
of
301
to
the
effect
that
section
(a),
that
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
between
an
employer
and
labor
organization
representing
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce
as
defined
in
this
act
or
between
any
such
labor
organizations
may
be
brought
in
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
having
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
without
respect
for
the
amount
of
controversy
or
without
regard
to
the
citizenship
of
the
parties.
and
it
would
seem
that
the
specific
statutory
language
and
the
general
pattern
of
the
legislation
would
in
the
first
instance
be
the
primary
source
to
inquiring
the
legislative
intent.
and
one
of
the
arguments
that
has
been
made
with
reference
to
this
question
of
whether
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
or
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
both
the
federal
and
state
courts
as
a
result
of
section
301
is
that
the
word
“may”
is
used
that
suits
may
be
brought
in
any
district
court
which
is
not
the
language
of
a
mandatory
exclusive
jurisdiction
normally
perhaps.
but
i
submit
that
dramatically
the
“may”
in
this
statute
or
in
this
clause
is
permissive
to
the
federal
courts
without
regard
to
the
amount
of
controversy
or
the
citizenship
of
the
parties.
in
other
words,
it's
permissive
to
the
federal
courts
to
act
regardless
of
these
restrictions
which
would
otherwise
apply.
it
is
not
permissive
necessarily
with
respect
to
federal
jurisdiction
vis-à-vis
state
jurisdiction.
i
think
this
would
be
a
fair
use
of
the
--
or
analysis
of
the
word
“may”
grammatically
in
this
particular
statute.
but
going
beyond
that
language
analysis,
if
we
look
at
the
pattern
of
the
legislation
itself,
the
taft-hartley
act,
i
think
it
becomes
somewhat
clear
that
where
the
congress
intended
to
permit
state
intervention
in
labor
relations
affecting
commerce
that
in
explicitly
and
expressly
said
so.
for
example,
there
is
nothing
presently
in
the
taft-hartley
act
which
says
that
the
board
has
exclusive
jurisdictional
or
unfair
labor
practices.
however,
it's
now
conceded
without
any
possibility
of
controversy
that
--
and
by
interpretations
of
this
court
that
the
power
of
the
board
is
exclusive
even
though
that
language
is
not
used
in
the
statute.
now,
when
the
court
saw
fit
to
grant
exclusive
or
rather
state
power
to
act,
it
did
so
in
express
language,
for
example
in
section
303
of
the
act
which
was
enacted
at
the
same
time
as
301,
the
language
is
that
whoever
shall
be
injured
in
his
business
or
property
by
reason
of
any
violation
of
subsection
(a)
which
is
the
secondary
boycott
provision,
may
sue
therefore
in
any
district
court
of
the
united
states,
subject
to
the
limitation
and
provision
of
section
301
without
respect
to
the
amount
in
controversy
or
in
any
other
court
having
jurisdiction
of
the
parties.
so
that
when
they
wanted
to
grant
and
specifically
say
this
court
--
state
courts
may
intervene
in
that
particular
situation,
enacted
simultaneously
with
301,
they
said
or
in
any
other
court
having
jurisdiction
of
the
parties.
they
did
not
use
that
language
in
section
301,
enacted
at
the
same
time.
mr.
george
h.
mason
that's
correct.
mr.
george
h.
mason
correct.
mr.
george
h.
mason
i
have
not
made
that
survey
your
honor.
i
am
familiar
with
certain
statutes
where
the
problem
has
risen
such
as
in
the
sherman
act
or
clayton
act,
the
patent
statutes
obviously,
the
employment
liability
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
i
think
the
fact
that
congress
had
no
--
gave
no
consideration
of
the
problem
as
never
deprive
the
court's
previous
decisions
from
interpreting
the
statute
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
correct
and
i
believe
that
we
have
an
imprecise
statute
on
that
particular
question
and
now
i'm
looking
first
at
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
and
if
you
see
if
that
throws
--
sheds
any
light
upon
the
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
well,
it
takes
such
a
certain
distance
in
this
respect
your
honor
that
for
example,
i've
pointed
out
section
303
(b)
which
specifically
says,
“the
courts
may
bring
a
suit
in
any
other
court.”
mr.
george
h.
mason
well
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
right.
mr.
george
h.
mason
i
think
specific
provision
--
specific
provision
does
not
shed
much
light.
mr.
george
h.
mason
then
i
move
on
to
the
general
pattern
of
the
act
of
which
this
particular
clause
is
applied,
which
i
think
is
a
logical
next
step
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
--
pursuing
this
inquiry
and
i
find
303
(b)
which
specifically
says,
“state
courts,
action
may
be
brought
in
the
state
court.”
i
find
in
section
10
(a)
which
gives
the
board
the
power
to
enforce
violations
of
unfair
labor
practices,
giving
the
board
the
power
to
see
enforcement
to
the
state
agencies
in
given
situations,
certain
types
of
industries.
there
they
specifically
give
this
power
in
10
(a),
in
14
(b),
where
they
want
to
preserve
the
rights
of
states
to
enforce
right
to
work
laws
which
could
have
been
preempted
by
the
federal
statute
if
it
saw
fit
to
do
so.
it
said
no
that
state
federal
right
to
work
law
shall
apply
and
here
is
another
situation
which
happened
recently
perhaps
in
1959
under
the
landrum-griffin,
the
labor
reporting
and
disclosure
act
of
1959
when
this
court
had
created
a
void,
a
no
man's
land
in
the
--
as
result
of
the
guss
case
where
the
state
court
couldn't
act.
the
state
court
was
barred
from
acting
even
though
the
national
board
declined
to
act
and
this
court
said,
“not
withstanding
the
declamation
of
the
state,
or
the
national
board,
the
state
board
could
not
act.”
this
was
a
preempted
field.
the
landrum-griffin
then
corrected
that
situation
in
--
by
adding
section
(c),
clause
(c)
to
section
14,
giving
the
board
the
right
to
cede
its
jurisdiction
where
it
felt
the
impact
on
the
--
when
the
interstate
commerce
was
insubstantial
to
the
state
agency,
a
power
which
was
not
previously
--
which
did
not
exist
previously
so
that
we
have
here
perhaps
four
different
categories
or
portions
of
the
act
where
the
congress
did
specifically
and
explicitly
give
power
to
the
state
to
intervene.
now,
i
say
this
create
somewhat
of
a
pattern
and
not
perhaps
an
overwhelming
argument
that
where
the
congress
wanted
the
state
to
intervene,
they
said
so
specifically,
even
though
they
did
not
say
in
other
situations,
these
powers
are
exclusive
to
the
federal
court,
but
looking
at
the
pattern
of
the
entire
language
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
give
some
assistance,
though
not
complete
argument.
mr.
george
h.
mason
right.
mr.
george
h.
mason
and
i
think
it's
a
--
the
next
consideration
that
i
would
come
to
after
analyzing
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
clause,
the
entire
statute
then
the
policy
behind
the
entire
legislation
of
which
this
clause
is
applied.
but
before
i
leave
the
--
the
language
problem,
i
might
--
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
impact
of
lincoln
mills'
decision
on
the
language
of
section
301.
lincoln
mills'
decision
holds
that
301
creates
a
substantive
law
and
this
being
a
federal
law
under
article
vi
of
the
supreme
law
constitutional
provision,
the
states,
if
they
had
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
would
obviously
be
bound
by
this
law.
and
then
you
find
in
section
301
specifically
that
in
suits
brought
in
the
district
court,
specifically
referring
to
suits
brought
in
the
district
court,
the
union
shall
be
regarded
as
an
entity,
may
be
sued
as
an
entity.
at
any
money
judgments
rendered
in
the
united
states
district
court
shall
be
enforceable
only
against
the
labor
organization
and
not
against
the
individual
members.
there
are
other
provisions
dealing
with
the
service
or
process
in
obtaining
jurisdiction
over
the
labor
organization,
again,
in
suits
brought
in
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states.
now,
if
we
say
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
that
this
statute
is
now
a
substantive
federal
law
which
must
be
applied
by
the
state
courts,
i
find
difficulty
in
maintaining
a
consistency
between
that
view
and
applying
the
language
of
the
statute
which
if
we
carried
the
--
onto
the
next
step
would
require
us
to
say
that
the
state
court
then
could
not
render
a
judgment
which
would
be
binding
upon
the
individual
members
of
the
union
if
this
is
substantive
law.
but
it's
difficult
to
me
that
--
to
see
how
you
can
fairly
say
that
when
the
statute
specifically
says,
“a
money
judgment
rendered
by
united
states
district
court
is
now
going
to
be
interpreted
to
be
a
money
judgment
rendered
by
a
state
court.”
the
language
is
inconsistent
it
seems
to
me
with
that
view.
so
that
i
--
let's
say
to
maintain
--
pardon.
mr.
george
h.
mason
the
interesting
thing
is
that
in
301
where
they
want
to
make
a
rule
of
law
of
general
application
without
applicability
only
to
district
courts
in
section
(e),
they
did
talk
about
agency
without
reference
to
whether
the
problem
or
issue
arose
in
the
federal
court
or
district
court.
and
this
of
course
brings
us
to
the
next
problem
which
this
court
probably
has
already
heard
about,
what
about
norris-laguardia
act
if
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction.
are
we
going
to
say
that
notwithstanding
that
section
301
talks
about
suits
and
the
district
courts
would
want
to
say
they
apply
to
the
state
courts,
i
am
personally
fearful
of
the
--
of
the
same
interpretive
procedure
being
applied
to
a
determination
that
norris-laguardia,
which
particularly
and
peculiarly
and
specially
restricts
united
states
district
courts
in
their
preventive
relief
in
these
labor
cases
and
doesn't
make
any
reference
to
interstate
commerce
is
now
going
to
be
said
to
apply
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
george
h.
mason
well
my
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
mason
at
the
recess,
i
think
we
were
discussing
the
application
of
norris-laguardia
to
the
state
courts
and
inquire
was
made
as
to
what
this
has
to
do
with
the
case
at
bar.
it
is
true
that
there
are
baby
norris-laguardia
acts
in
most
of
the
industrial
states,
but
i
venture
to
say
that
there
are
many
states
which
do
not
have
a
baby
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
george
h.
mason
i
raise
the
question
solely
because
of
the
difficulty
i
found
in
applying
substantive
law
expressed
in
section
301
specifically
referable
to
united
state
district
courts
and
saying
that
would
also
apply
in
the
state
courts.
i
raise
the
norris-laguardia
act
for
the
same
reason
that
if
it
were
true
that
a
statute
was
specifically
restricted
or
created
rights
pursuable
in
united
state
district
courts
could
be
said
to
also
apply
in
state
courts
even
though
the
language
is
restrictive
to
district
courts
then
the
same
reasoning
certainly
could
be
ruled
in
saying
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
which
restricts
injunctions
in
the
federal
courts
if
it
establishes
a
federal
labor
policy
which
is
a
federal
law,
and
must
be
enforced
by
the
state
courts
and
apply
it,
should
also
apply
in
the
state
courts
and
peculiarly
enough
in
this
brief
written
by
the
union
in
this
case,
the
union
said
that
this
court
holds
for
example
as
we
believe
it
should
that
norris-laguardia
act
precludes
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
against
the
strike
and
an
action
brought
in
the
federal
court
under
section
301,
the
same
limitation
would
have
to
be
applied
that
such
an
action
were
brought
in
the
state
court.
mr.
george
h.
mason
that's
contrary,
yes.
in
mccarroll,
the
california
court
said,
the
federal
law
301
(inaudible)
to
this
strike
or
this
suit,
but
we
are
not
restricted
in
the
relief,
we
can
grant.
since
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction,
we
can
grant
an
injunction
even
though
a
federal
court
could
not
if
the
action
were
brought
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
george
h.
mason
i
think
there
is
a
case
that
was
brought
up
with
this
term
of
the
court
if
i
am
correct
which
involved
the
issue
as
to
whether
norris-laguardia
act
was
effective
in
a
301
action.
and
i
think
that
was
--
should've
been
argued
if
it
wasn't
the
--
it
was
on
the
list
at
least
in
this
term.
so
the
issue
has
already
been
raised
as
to
one
does
the
norris-laguardia
act
apply
at
all
on
the
--
is
taft-hartley's
section
301,
did
that
supersede
norris-laguardia
and
i
think
the
anomaly
in
this
case
is
indicated
and
pointed
up
very
specifically
by
what
i
just
read
from
my
brother's
brief
that
i
suspect
that
the
united
steelworkers
union
would
prefer
to
be
arguing
my
side
of
the
case
and
not
decide
that
the
action
of
litigation
places
them
on
--
in
this
case.
mr.
george
h.
mason
well,
there
have
been
two
adjudications
i
know
by
the
federal
courts
in
which
this
question
has
been
raised.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
your
honor
in
the
westinghouse
case,
in
the
circuit
court,
the
court
in
that
case
took
the
position
that
the
jurisdiction
was
exclusive
in
the
federal
courts.
and
this
was
commented
upon,
i
believe,
by
this
court's
opinion
and
without
any
adverse
comment
at
least,
whatever
that
might
signify.
mr.
george
h.
mason
no.
mr.
george
h.
mason
no.
i
know
there
are
two
united
states
district
courts
with
decisions
referred
to
in
our
brief
which
holds
that
the
federal
jurisdiction
is
exclusive.
mr.
george
h.
mason
i
stole
it
from
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
mason
it's
an
accident
as
to
the
position
your
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
it's
an
accident
perhaps
from
the
standpoint
of
your
own
philosophic
the
concepts
as
oppose
to
the
interest
of
your
client
for
which
whom
you're
an
advocate.
that's
what
i
meant
really.
mr.
george
h.
mason
i
don't
believe,
so
i
think
they
look
to
counsel
for
that
advice
your
honor
normally
because
we
were
an
unwilling
party
in
this
case
to
litigation
instituted
in
the
state
court.
mr.
george
h.
mason
yes,
your
honor.
so
that
seems
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
specific
language
of
the
statute
leaves
any
ambiguity
here
an
interpretation
of
section
301
to
the
effect
that
federal
court
jurisdiction
is
exclusive,
makes
all
the
language
of
301
consistent.
but
when
you
take
the
different
position
that
the
states
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
then
you
will
have
difficulty
it
seems
to
me
in
applying
language
specifically
referable
to
united
states
district
courts
and
i
think
the
court
then
must
say
that
this
substantive
law
will
have
to
apply
in
the
state
courts
and
it
almost
involves,
if
that
is
a
federal
law
required
by
the
state
courts
--
requiring
the
state
courts
to
comply
with
it
that
the
federal
law
would
be
saying
to
a
state
court
even
though
you
do
not
recognize
in
your
legal
concepts
a
labor
organization,
the
voluntary
unincorporated
association
as
an
entity,
we
will
require
you
in
these
suits
to
include
in
your
concept
of
entity
a
labor
organization
as
amended,
which
seems
to
be
going
pretty
far
for
the
federal
law
to
tell
the
state
court
what
concepts
or
legal
entities
that
the
law
understands
and
recognizes
is
insufficient
and
they
must
move
forward
now
to
another
concept.
mr.
george
h.
mason
it
wouldn't
have
estopped
him
from
raising
the
question.
i
wonder
if
the
court
wouldn't
be
estopped
from
denying
by
virtue
of
3
--
301
that
there
was
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
conceivably
but
this
does
not
seem
to
satisfy
my
sense
of
judicial
consistency.
[attempt
to
laughter]
now,
if
the
specific
language
of
the
state
leaves
any
ambiguity
as
to
the
intent
of
congress,
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
serious
controversy
as
to
what
the
intent
of
the
congress
was
with
reference
to
the
entire
piece
of
legislation
of
which
301
is
applied,
namely
to
enact
a
uniform
and
comprehensive
code
of
regulation
in
this
field
of
labor
relations
and
it
would
seem
to
us
that
if
we
are
to
have
a
uniform
national
code
of
regulation
or
labor
relations,
that
that
purpose
is
best
served
if
we
vest
in
the
federal
courts
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
enforce
violations
of
collective
agreements.
i
think
it
is
difficult
and
even
though
the
legislature,
the
congress
in
considering
this
question
of
301,
discarded
a
suggestion
that
a
violation
of
the
labor
collective
agreement
be
made
an
unfair
labor
of
practice
and
they
said,
“we
will
leave
that
issue
to
the
usual
processes
of
the
court.”
even
that
position
did
not
remove
suits
for
violation
of
collective
agreements
from
the
general
scope
and
purview
of
the
act
and
the
purposes
it
was
designed
to
attain
namely
to
reduce
or
minimize
industrial
strike
and
promote
the
free
flow
of
commerce.
now,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
you
can
separate
the
contract
itself
which
is
consummated
through
a
collective
bargaining
process,
from
the
collective
bargaining
process
which
is
designed
to
achieve
that
contract.
in
other
words,
the
taft-hartley
act
itself
was
very
far
in
inserting
itself
into
this
collective
agreement.
first
it
says,
“who
will
be
recognized
as
the
bargaining
agent
for
the
employees
to
negotiate
this
contract
and
consummate
it.”
it
then
goes
on
to
say,
“what
will
be
considered
proper
collective
bargaining
and
what
will
be
considered
a
refusal
to
bargain
in
the
process
of
trying
to
achieve
this
agreement”
and
they
go
further
in
section
8
(d)
(4)
and
say
that
a
contract
once
consummated
must
--
cannot
be
terminated.
now
this
is
certainly
inserting
itself
right
into
the
contractual
obligations
of
the
parties,
it
can't
be
terminated
unless
certain
conditions
are
followed
such
as
60-day
notice
in
notifying
the
federal
mediation
service
and
the
state
mediation
service.
and
that
the
terms
of
that
contract
shall
continue
to
enforce
until
the
expiration
of
that
60-day
notice
period
or
the
termination
of
the
contract
whichever
is
laid
there.
so
they
even
add
terms
to
this
conditional
--
to
this
contract
which
were
not
inserted
by
the
parties,
by
legislation.
now,
the
step
--
the
next
beyond
that
and
the
failure
to
comply
with
this
provision
constitutes
refusal
to
bargain
and
unfair
labor
practice.
it
seems
to
me
then
that
the
enforcement
of
that
contract
which
is
almost
the
principal
objective
of
the
entire
act
in
its
control
of
collective
bargaining
must
be
said
to
be
an
integral
and
intimate
part
of
this
whole
national
policy
to
achieve
a
minimum
of
industrial
strife
and
a
minimum
of
interference
with
the
free
flow
of
commerce.
of
course,
this
is
based
under
the
constitutional
question
which
is
already
been
decided,
but
it
is
our
contention
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
taft-hartley
act
is
considered
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
section
301
that
that
purpose
can
best
be
served,
we
submit,
by
holding
that
implicit
in
301
was
a
design
to
vest
jurisdiction
over
violations
of
collective
agreements
in
the
federal
courts
as
distinguished
in
the
state
courts.
the
conclusion
just
suggested
is
almost
confirmed
not
quite
by
the
distance
that
this
court,
it
seems
to
me
went
in
garmon
ii,
when
it
said
that
in
the
case
involving
what
might
--
which
--
what
was
potentially
or
arguably
a
protected
or
prohibited
activity
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
the
state
courts
were
precluded
from
taking
action
from
intervening
because
of
the
possible
frustration
of
our
national
labor
policy.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
design
to
keep
control
and
the
regulation
of
these
labor
relations
as
it
affects
interstate
commerce
in
the
hands
first
of
the
board
which
was
most
expert.
and
i
submit
further
that
in
the
board
which
was
most
expert,
i
submit
that
in
the
federal
courts
we
might
well
contend
that
they
would
be
more
experts
than
the
state
courts
in
serving
this
national
policy.
and
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
language
of
professor
archibald
cox
of
the
harvard
law
school
who
has
studied
this
subject
quite
intensely.
and
in
1958,
in
the
american
bar
association
section
of
labor
and
relations
proceedings
in
commenting
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
during
the,
i
believe,
the
1957
term,
he
had
this
to
say
in
discussing
the
impact
of
laburnum
and
russell
on
the
question
of
a
state
remedy
for
damages
being
made
available
where
the
federal
law
did
not
provide
such
a
remedy
and
where
the
court
held
that
in
certain
cases
involving
the
public
welfare's,
the
police
power,
the
state
could
act.
and
professor
cox
said
the
state
judges
have
little
experience
in
cases
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
the
temptation
would
be
to
follow
state
law
and
let
the
supreme
court
--
and
let
the
supreme
court
decide
whether
the
field
was
not
preempted,
that
every
misinterpretation
would
involve
a
small
impairment
of
the
national
labor
policy
and
that
permitting
state
jurisdictions
award
damages,
absent
such
relief
under
federal
law
would
make
every
state
sued
in
industry
affecting
commerce
potentially
reviewable
by
the
supreme
court.
furthermore,
the
relative
and
expertness
of
the
state
tribunals
in
interpreting
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
seem
to
require
added
care
in
scrutinizing
their
decisions.
and
i
believe
this
court
in
garner
too,
made
reference
to
multiplicity
of
tribunals
dealing
with
a
particular
subject,
not
being
particularly
designed
to
achieve
a
high
degree
of
uniformity.
this
way,
i
think,
i
was
paraphrasing
the
court's
opinion
in
the
garmon
case,
so
that
we
submit
that
the
interpretation
of
section
301
as
creating
a
substantive
law
to
be
enforceable
exclusively
in
the
federal
courts
would
best
serve
the
national
policy
of
the
act.
mr.
george
h.
mason
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
mason
if
this
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
conceivably.
mr.
george
h.
mason
juries?
mr.
george
h.
mason
did
you
say
your
honor
that
juries
might
be
involved?
mr.
george
h.
mason
yes.
mr.
george
h.
mason
no,
i
think
this
is
conceivable
even
under
our
equity
jurisdiction.
mr.
george
h.
mason
frankly
your
honor,
i
don't
quite
follow
the
point
because
if
the
suit
is
one
cognizable
only
in
the
federal
courts
namely
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
h.
mason
if
it
involves
--
if
it
involves
a
question
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
h.
mason
state
court.
mr.
george
h.
mason
i
think
this
is
a
potential
--
this
is
possible
i
think
but
perhaps
not
too
likely
in
an
offhand
consideration
of
that
question.
mr.
george
h.
mason
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
mason
although
conceivably
reviewable
possibly
by
the
supreme
court
even
in
the
adjudication
by
the
state
court
where
it
0involves
a
federal
question,
it's
conceivable.
following
out
professor
cox's
viewpoint
as
to
the
lack
of
expert
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
state
courts,
there
is
50
state
jurisdictions
as
opposed
to
the
federal
courts
which
is
no
reflection
on
the
state
courts
except
that
these
matters
do
not
commonly
come
before
them
in
the
form
in
which
they
come
before
the
federal
courts,
it
is
not
simply
and
merely
a
matter
involving
an
action
for
damages
that's
involved
in
a
violation
of
a
collective
agreement.
there
are
specialized
types
of
problems
that
only
one
familiar
with
the
day-to-day
interpretations
and
the
words
of
art
that
develop
in
the
collective
bargaining
process,
only
those
familiar
with
that
situation
could
adequately,
it
seems
to
me,
deal
with
them
judicially.
the
term
seniority
has
taken
on
in
it
--
the
course
of
bargaining
very
distinct
special
implications
quite
far
beyond
whether
a
layman
might
first
suspect
when
he
saw
the
word.
it
enters
into
and
pervades
the
entire
contract
in
many,
many
concepts
of
the
collective
agreement.
union
shop,
this
is
a
special
kind
of
a
thing
that
would
require
some
expertise
to
understand
and
apply.
the
act
itself
has
direct
bearing
on
many
of
these
contract
clauses
such
as
check
off
of
union
dues
which
the
act
itself
regulate
specifically
as
to
how
--
what
kind
of
an
authorization
can
be
given
and
how
--
what
the
duration
of
that
will
be
and
grievance
procedure
and
arbitration
procedures
in
the
labor
field.
all
of
these
matters,
it
seems
to
me
would
require
a
special
knowledge
which
could
be
best
administered
by
a
smaller
group
of
federal
courts
dealing
specifically
with
these
problems
as
they
do
under
unfair
labor
practice
complaints
which
are
exclusively
within
their
jurisdiction.
the
point
i
make
is
that
the
problem
of
unfair
labor
practices
which
this
court
has
time
and
again
said
should
be
supervised
and
the
congress
intended
should
be
supervised
by
especially
schooled
and
trained
administrative
agency.
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
some
extent,
but
not
entirely,
to
the
actions
for
violation
of
the
collective
agreements
which
arise
out
of
the
collective
bargaining
process.
and
we
can
visualize
the
many
conflicts
that
may
arise
with
reference
to
a
situation
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
between
the
federal
and
state
courts.
i
mentioned
in
passing
the
possible
argument
that
will
be
made
at
some
point,
i'm
sure
of
the
application
of
norris-laguardia,
but
beyond
that,
take
the
lincoln
mills
decision,
which
established
to
tell
that
there
was
established
state
federal
law
to
--
in
this
field
of
violation
of
collective
agreements
and
directed
the
court
to
create
that
law.
now,
i'm
troubled
with
the
situation
where
the
jurisdiction
is
concurrent
when
the
case
arises
in
the
state
court
and
on
an
issue
upon
which
the
federal
courts
had
never
made
any
declaration
or
ruling.
what
is
the
state
court
to
do?
i
interpreted
lincoln
mills,
to
mean,
and
unless
i'm
incorrect,
that
it
is
the
federal
courts
who
are
to
fashion
of
the
federal
law
and
not
the
state
courts.
if
that
would
be
so,
what
happens
when
the
issue
arises
for
the
first
time
in
the
state
court?
no
adjudication
of
this
court
or
any
even
other
federal
court
on
the
question.
mr.
george
h.
mason
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
mason
correct.
mr.
george
h.
mason
well
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
correct
and
don't
--
isn't
it
fair
to
assume
that
the
state
courts
jealous
of
their
legal
body
of
law
and
their
prerogatives?
well,
in
the
absence
of
a
federal
statement
from
a
federal
court
or
decision
of
the
federal
court
make
the
assumption
that
the
state
law
is
the
law
that
the
federal
court
ought
to
apply
anyway
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
yes,
even
to
that
extent
so
that
we
can
expect
the
state
courts
to
perhaps
pay
little
attention
to
federal
law
not
deliberately,
but
subconsciously
in
interpreting
problems
coming
up
under
301
which
were
not
passed
upon
by
any
federal
court.
mr.
george
h.
mason
well,
that
--
that's
not
entirely
a
temporary
matter
your
honor
coming
up
here.
mr.
george
h.
mason
no.
mr.
george
h.
mason
i
--
mr.
george
h.
mason
i
would
--
i
would
go
further
your
honor
and
say
that
the
importance
of
certainty
in
the
law
is
really
of
extreme
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
h.
mason
well,
mr.
justice
holmes,
i
believe
he
said
it
was
the
guess
as
to
what
the
supreme
court
would
do
which
could
hardly
--
would
do
in
a
given
situation
and
that
may
not
be
as
certain
as
you'd
like.
but
certainly,
in
the
law
is
of
great
importance
in
the
practical
application
of
the
day-to-day
administration
of
labor
relations
which
i
think
this
court
could
acknowledge
as
a
factor
in
this
situation.
and
if
we
had
tried
to
reduce
industrial
strife
and
minimize
it
and
avoid
the
interferences
with
interstate
commerce,
the
more
certain
the
law
is
the
less
opportunity
for
confusion
and
complexities
which
plague
the
practitioners
and
the
specialists
and
the
more
chance
of
industrial
peace
if
at
least
the
parties
know
what
their
legal
rights
and
obligations
are.
but
when
that
is
in
the
state
of
flux
and
uncertainty,
we
create
by
that
very
uncertainty,
more
industrial
strife
then
it
would
otherwise
be
the
case
from
the
practical
standpoint.
we
make
one
other
point
in
this
case
about
the
violation
in
constituting
an
unfair
labor
practice
so
that
apart
from
the
exclusiveness
of
jurisdiction
on
the
garmon
ii
since
this
was
a
matter
which
was
potentially
within
the
purview
of
the
act,
the
state
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
anyway,
that
is
the
secondary
consideration.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
mason
i
should
like
to
make,
if
your
honor
please,
one
comment
about
prior
adjudications
on
this
issue
that's
here
involved.
i
would
say
that
quantitatively,
the
decisions
have
been
against
the
proposition
for
which
i
have
been
arguing.
however,
it
should
be
said
noted
that
most
of
those
decisions
are
state
court
decisions
in
which
the
state
being
very
zealous
of
its
prerogatives
would
normally
be
expected
to
support
its
own
jurisdiction.
and
it
maybe
of
interest
to
the
court
that
mr.
chief
justice
wilkins
in
the
decision
in
this
case
that
went
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
said,
“in
the
absence
of
a
clear
holding
by
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
that
federal
jurisdiction
has
been
made
exclusive,
we
shall
not
make
what
would
be
tantamount
to
an
abdication
of
the
hitherto
undoubted
jurisdiction
of
our
court.
even
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
is
looking
forward
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case.
thank
you
your
honor.
