mr.
david
e.
feller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
perhaps
better
that
i
begin
where
mr.
mason
left
off
because
i
think
the
problems
which
he
has
envisaged
as
a
potential
possibility
of
sustaining
what
almost
every
court
has
assumed
is
the
continued
state
court
jurisdiction
of
these
matters
are
much
greater
than
he
describes.
i
do
not
see
those
problems
and
in
fact
create
for
me
a
very
little
difficulty
but
i
want
to
clear
what
we're
talking
about.
we're
talking
about
a
suit
brought
by
one
party
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
against
another
party
for
breach
of
contract
not
bringing
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
that
suit
is
brought
in
a
state
court.
if
we
are
correct
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
and
the
federal
courts
is
concurrent
to
enforce
the
federal
law
governing
these
matters,
the
defendant,
if
he
likes,
has
the
right
to
remove
it
to
the
federal
court
so
that
the
employer
concerned
with
the
desire
or
the
union,
defendant
in
such
a
case
is
concerned
with
the
desire
to
get
federal
treatment
or
handling
of
this
case
procedurally
has
the
right
to
do
it.
the
only
case
which
remains
in
the
state
court,
as
we
see
it,
is
a
case
where
both
parties
would
prefer
to
have
this
matter
adjudicated
by
the
state
court.
if
the
plaintiff
wants
it
adjudicated
in
the
federal
court,
he
brings
the
suit
in
the
federal
court.
if
the
defendant
wants
it
adjudicated
in
the
federal
court,
he
removes
it.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
the
plaintiff
has
the
choice,
but
as
i
understand
it,
if
it's
a
suit
which
could
have
been
brought
in
a
federal
court,
the
removal
statute
gives
the
defendant
the
right
to
remove
that
case.
mr.
david
e.
feller
because
that
statute
specifically
so
stated
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
this
court
read
the
statute
as
i
would
say.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
do
not
read
this.
i
read
the
statute,
i
mean
perhaps
the
easy
way
to
say
is
not
(inaudible),
our
contention
is
that
if
the
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
as
we
believe
they
do,
the
case
is
nevertheless
removable
and
therefore
the
problems
are
not
so
great
and
that
is
accordance
with
what
every
court
that
has
dealt
with
this
matter
has
so
far
held.
mr.
david
e.
feller
oh
no.
mr.
david
e.
feller
obviously
not,
your
honor.
i'm
simply
stating
what
my
contention
is
and
that
by
argument
develops,
i
think
the
argument,
all
of
the
arguments
that
my
brother
mason
has
made,
argue,
i
think
for
the
proposition
which
has
so
far
not
been
contested
i
may
add
in
any
court
that
i
know
because
these
suits
are
being
removed
to
the
federal
court
everyday,
in
practice
today.
and
my
brother
in
fact
cites
fay
against
cystoscope
makers
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
was
a
removal
case
and
there
are
several
others.
mr.
david
e.
feller
huh?
mr.
david
e.
feller
because
the
suit
--
the
original
jurisdiction
was
under
301
and
it's
also
a
law
regulating
commerce
which
has
no
dollar
limitation.
now,
all
of
the
arguments
which
my
brother
is
making
as
to
the
compliments
of
the
federal
courts
would
argue
certainly
against
any
holding
and
we're
not
arguing
that
case
here.
i'm
simply
saying
it
is
my
view
that
if
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction,
it
has
jurisdiction
only
so
long
as
both
parties
are
willing
to
accept
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
e.
feller
there
was
no
effort
to
remove.
(voice
overlap)
the
defendants
simply
took
the
position
which
he
has
the
right
to
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
the
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
indeed
if
he
were
right
that
the
state
court
has
no
jurisdiction
then
the
cause
would
not
be
removable.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
perfectly
concede
that
there
are
many
times
when
parties
for
many
reasons
decide
not
to
exercise
their
right
to
remove.
my
only
point
was
really
delimiting
the
scope
of
our
problem,
was
that
the
consequence
of
a
decision
here
holding
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction
is
simply
that
where
parties
choose
that
state
courts
will
exercise
that
jurisdiction
only
where
both
parties
are
agreeable
that
they
should,
but
whatever
reasons
they
may
decide,
they
would
prefer
to
leave
the
case
in
the
state
court.
now,
one
other
problem
to
delimit
the
scope
of
our
case,
we
are
dealing
with
breach
of
contract
actions
not
with
unfair
labor
practices.
i
think
this
is
very
important
because
most
of
the
authorities
quoted
by
my
brother
mason
deal
with
unfair
labor
practice
questions
and
tort
suits
in
the
state
courts.
laburnum,
russell,
the
cases
mentioned,
were
tort
suits,
not
breach
of
contract
actions;
garner
was
a
tort
suit.
garmon
was
a
tort
suit.
all
of
these
cases
were
tort
suits
not
suits
for
breach
of
contract.
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
301
is
a
contract
and
that's
why
we're
talking
about
301.
we're
not
talking
about
either
torts
or
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
now
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
normal
preemption
rule
which
we
can
get
sloppy
and
say
applies
to
labor
relations,
but
what
this
court
said
in
garner
was
that
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
of
this
statute
and
i'll
quote
the
garner
case,
"congress
did
not
merely
lay
down
a
substantive
rule
of
law
to
be
enforced
by
any
tribunal
competent
to
apply
law
generally
to
the
parties.
it
went
on
to
confide
primary
interpretation
and
application
of
its
rules
to
a
specific
and
especially
constituted
tribunal
and
prescribed
a
particular
procedure
for
investigation,
complaint
and
notice,
and
hearing
and
decision,
including
judicial
relief
pending
a
final
administrative
order.‚Äù
they,
indeed,
provided
a
prosecuting
agency
and
the
general
counsel
for
the
labor
board.
for
the
this
reason,
the
court
said
that
this
kind
of
a
matter
not
only
the
federal
substantive
law
applied,
but
it
was
to
be
handled
through
the
exclusive
agency,
which
congress
had
established
for
this
purpose
and
which
indeed
congress
in
the
wagner
act
said
was
exclusive.
my
brother
mason
said
that
there's
no
language
of
exclusivity
in
there
because
i'm
sure
this
court
is
aware.
the
exclusive
language
was
taken
out
of
section
10
(a)
of
the
act
solely
because
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
provision
providing
for
the
session
of
jurisdiction
of
the
states
and
the
conference
committee
reports
are
clear
that
congress
still
intended
to
make
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board
in
unfair
labor
practice
matters
exclusive,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
that
kind
of
a
matter
here.
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
congress
made
a
specific
decision
to
exclude
breach
of
contract
matters
from
that
rule.
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
two
are
unfortunately
and
separately
intertwined
i
cannot
--
i
cannot
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
--
my
own
belief
is
that
the
bodies
which
are
customarily
endowed
with
the
duty
of
dealing
with
collective
bargaining
make
better
judges
in
suits
for
breach
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
than
judges
who
don't
do
that.
i
would
therefore
have
probably
thought
that
congress
should
have
not
done
what
it
did
do,
that
is
reject
the
provision
in
the
senate
bill.
the
bill
passed
the
senate
providing
that
a
breach
of
contract
should
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
therefore
process
through
the
board
and
the
matter
should
be
handled
through
the
specialized
agency.
the
house
decided
otherwise
in
conference,
it
was
decided
to
accept
the
house
decision
rather
than
the
senate
decision
and
that
these
matters
be
left
to
the
usual
processes
of
law.
now,
the
usual
processes
of
law,
and
simply
the
expert
body
is
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
by
and
large,
the
courts
of
appeals.
in
talking
about
the
federal
courts,
we
forget
that
federal
district
courts
are
almost
as
foreign
to
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
as
state
courts
are
except
in
the
limited
area
of
the
so
called
mandatory
injunction
which
they
used
very
little
in
which
the
district
court
practically
has
nothing
to
do
but
issue
an
injunction
where
the
general
counsel
as
a
preliminary
matter.
it
doesn't
eventually
decide
the
case.
the
case
is
decided
by
national
labor
relations
board
and
then
reviewed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
if
it
relates
to
a
field
of
litigation
which
is
excluded
from
their
jurisdiction,
they
may
if
they're
intellectually
curios,
but
i
suggest
the
good
state
court
judges
read
them
too.
mr.
david
e.
feller
some
do,
but
again
the
federal
district
court
as
a
class,
are
not
people
given
a
special
place
or
any
place
really
in
the
administration
of
the
statute.
alright,
now,
we've
delimited
the
problem.
now,
in
delimiting
their
problem,
i
want
to
make
one
thing
clear.
the
fact,
it
can
be
in
a
given
case
and
here
i
agree
entirely
with
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
that
the
same
act
can
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
a
breach
of
contract.
the
two
are
not
--
or
they're
in
different
legal
cubbyholes
actually
they're
sometimes
very
closely
related
and
you
can't
link
that
fact.
contract
may
provide,
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
against
union
members.
suit
is
brought
for
breach
of
that
contract.
there
is
a
contractural
obligation
and
relief
is
sought
for
a
breach
of
that,
but
in
fact
what
the
parties
have
agreed
to
do
is
to
abide
by
the
law
and
there
is
a
procedure
for
dealing
with
the
violation
of
the
law
and
unfair
labor
practice
procedure.
the
two
are
nevertheless
distinct
although
they
may
involve
the
same
thing
and
the
fact
that
a
breach
of
contract
has
occurred
is
of
course
remedy
of
both
--
as
a
contract
matter,
not
as
a
public
matter
but
a
public
right
as
between
the
contract
just
if
i
make
a
contract
with
a
man
not
to
hit
me
in
the
face
and
he
hits
me
in
the
face
and
i
presume
i
can
sue
him
for
damages
for
having
hit
me
in
the
face
even
though
he
can
also
be
prosecuted
by
the
district
attorney
for
assault
because
he
has
violated
the
contractual
obligation
to
me.
now
the
question
before
us
then
is,
only
the
breach
of
contract
though
it
is
a
labor
relations
matter
it
is
--
the
question
is
whether
a
state
court
has
cognizance
of
the
breach
of
contract
action.
and
that
question
is
whether
it
has
been
deprived
of
its
right
to
hear
that
question
and
decided
in
accordance
with
federal
law.
we
have
no
argument
about
here
that
the
substantive
law
is
federal
by
the
provisions
of
section
301.
now,
the
first
--
we
start
with
the
language
of
the
statute
that
section
301
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
that
the
federal
district
courts
may
take
jurisdiction.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
indicated
in
the
argument,
the
early
argument
that
some
interest
in
inquiry
as
to
generally
how
statues
of
this
nature
are
construed
in
other
places
where
congress
has
created
willingly
or
unwillingly
a
right
to
litigate.
well,
we
make
a
brief
effort
to
investigate
that
question.
and
the
general
view,
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
is
that
congress
is
almost
never
found
when
it
creates
a
federal
substantive
right
to
have
vested
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
that
right,
almost
never
found
to
do
so
where
the
--
it
does
not
specifically
say
so
that
the
right
of
enforcement
is
exclusive.
the
one
exception
is
the
sherman
and
clayton
act
action
for
triple
damages.
a
decision
which
has
been
much
criticized,
but
which
is
there,
which
is
saying
that
state
courts
do
not
have
the
right
to
enforce
a
cause
of
action
for
triple
damages
under
the
clayton
act,
despite
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
specifically
say
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
are
--
is
exclusive.
generally
speaking,
when
congress
has
created
a
federal
substantive
right;
that
right,
if
it
not
otherwise
so
specified,
is
enforceable
in
the
federal
courts
or
in
the
state
courts
indeed
than
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
from
the
very
nature
of
things,
the
law
each
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
who
are
before
him.
it
enforces
law
whether
derived
from
federal
law
or
state
law
in
all
cases.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
like,
it
goes
way
back
to
--
what's
the
--
claflin
against
houseman.
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
with
a
preference
in
bankruptcy
when
congress
said
that
a
certain
transfer
should
constitute
a
preference
in
bankruptcy.
this
court
said
that
the
--
as
--
in
bankruptcy
could
sue
in
the
state
court
on
that
claim
created
by
congress.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
the
question
of
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
(voice
overlap)
wasn't
bankruptcy
and
there
are
very
large
policy
questions.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
there
are
large
policy
questions
for
example
in
habeas
corpus
in
one
of
the
cases
which
we
cite
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
a
state
court
has
the
right
to
enforce
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
a
federal
claim
to
adjudicate
a
claim
of
federal
unconstitutionality
or
improper
use
of
federal
process
in
a
state
court.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
that
case,
i
remember
that
the
state
agent
was
--
ended
up
in
jail.
the
agent
of
the
state
of
oregon
who
came
to
arrest
the
man
in
california
ended
up
in
jail
when
the
california
court
said
that
he
was
--
his
actions
in
arresting
the
prisoner
violated
the
federal
constitution
and
he
said
the
state
court
can't
say
that.
of
course,
state
courts
can
say
that.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
say
almost
that
and
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
i
don't
say
they
must
because
i
don't
want
to
get
to
the
test
and
the
question
of
whether
the
state
courts
have
to
hear
these
cases,
that's
another
question.
i'd
say
the
state
courts
may
and
with
one
exception,
i
have
been
able
to
find
no
case
and
that's
the
sherman
and
clayton
act
where
a
federally
created
substantive
right
was
not
enforceable
at
the
option
of
the
parties
in
a
state
court
where
congress
did
not
say
exclusively
that
jurisdiction
shall
be
exclusively
in
the
federal
court.
now,
again,
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
so
certain
because
i
have
one
exception,
the
sherman
and
clayton
acts
but
this
at
least
poses
the
general
framework
in
which
i
think
we
looked
at
a
given
statute
because
this
is
the
way
congress
is
used
to
having
its
words
treated.
so
we
have
to
look
at
the
policy
of
this
statute
as
well
as
the
language.
the
language
certainly
doesn't
say
exclusive.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes,
but
on
our
federal
employers
liability
act,
i
take
it
the
defendant
does
not
have
the
right
to
remove
because
that
was
a
question
which
have
been
much
litigated
in
this
court
and
i
don't
want
to
get
involved
in
controversies
which
i
think
are
at
least
now
settled
and
which
may
involve
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes,
but
by
virtue
of
the
specific
statutory
language
in
that
case
and
the
specific
policy
of
those
statutes,
the
court
said
here
that
those
cases
were
not
removable,
but
the
plaintiff
could
bring
him
in
either
case
by
specific
language
of
congress.
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
congress
said
so
in
words.
in
other
words,
it
said,
‚Äúif
you
could
bring
a
suit
in
a
state
court‚Äù
it
said
so.
mr.
david
e.
feller
it
is
said
so
in
section
303
of
this
statute.
mr.
david
e.
feller
we
have
to
look
at
the
statutes
which
don't
say
anything
like
the
civil
rights
act
which
simply
says
that
wherever
--
i
think
section
47,
it's
now
1985,
‚Äúwhoever
shall
go
up
on
the
highway
and
disguise
in
the
conspiracy
section,
if
anyone
is
injured
in
that
way
he
shall
have
a
right
of
action,‚Äù
period.
it
doesn't
say
where.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
it
says
district
courts
shall
have
jurisdiction.
it
does
not
say
such
jurisdiction
shall
be
exclusive.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
i
--
again,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
history
of
the
sherman
and
clayton
act
litigation
but
i
think
there
was
in
that
case
developing
from
the
amendment
of
the
sherman
act
by
the
clayton
act
and
the
right
to
bring
private
action
in
addition
of
the
public
right,
a
background
which
led
the
court
to
that
conclusion.
i
personally
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
justify
a
decision
which
is
not
my
field
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
my
field
of
competence.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
that
is
expressed
in
either
in
that
decision
or
in
a
later
decision.
again,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
let
me
get
to
the
--
let's
assume
that
the
language
is
ambiguous
and
we
can
go
either
way
here
and
let's
look
at
the
policy
of
the
statute
and
what
is
accomplished
by
it.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that,
as
i've
already
indicated.
congress
made
a
specific
decision
that
this
matter
should
be
handled
in
the
usual
processes
of
the
law.
there
is
nothing
within
the
policy
of
this
statute
which
indicates
that
the
federal
district
courts
would
more
affectively
enforce
the
federal
rights.
now
remember
we
are
not
arguing
what
is
the
applicable
law.
we
accept
lincoln
mills
which
says
that
the
applicable
law
is
federal.
now,
what
kind
of
cases
do
you
have?
look
at
this
case.
this
is
a
very
simple
case
which
all
of
this
argument
is
about
policy
concern.
here,
we
have
a
case
where
an
employer,
a
negotiating
committee
met
with
the
union,
maybe
this
is
the
wrong
place
to
state
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
i
think
they
should
be
stated
some
time.
a
union
and
an
employer
had
an
agreement.
the
negotiating
committees
met.
a
vice-president,
the
brother
of
the
president
of
the
company,
a
member
of
board
of
directors
was
the
chairman
of
negotiating
committee,
they
met,
they
negotiated
an
agreement
providing
for
a
13-cent
an
hour
wage
increase
for
one
additional
holiday,
for
elimination
of
rate
ranges
in
pay
and
that
vacation
should
be
computed
on
in
anniversary
basis.
they
signed
a
memorandum
to
this
effect
and
that
this
should
be
effective
may
20,
which
was
the
date
of
the
expiration
of
the
old
agreement.
then
they
had
later
meetings
at
which
they
negotiated
the
language
implementing
this.
the
company
in
the
meantime,
put
the
wage
increase
into
effect
which
was
contained
in
the
memorandum,
even
though
as
it
said
in
its
notice,
the
final
language
hadn't
been
worked
out.
it
was
agreed
that
it
would
be
retroactive
and
they
put
it
in
13
cents
an
hour.
the
vice-president,
member
of
the
board
of
directors
and
head
of
the
negotiating
committee
tendered
a
formally
signed
contract
document
to
the
union
and
then
the
union
was
informed
that
the
people
that
they
have
been
dealing
with
were
not
authorized
to
represent
the
company,
but
the
contract
was
therefore
nullity
and
that
wages
will
be
reduced
hence
for
13
cents
an
hour,
the
amount
by
which
they
were
increased
as
a
result
of
the
agreement.
now,
what
are
the
difficult
questions
of
law
involved?
the
questions
litigated
before
the
master
is,
was
there
authority
in
this
negotiating
committee?
did
the
president
of
the
company
know
about
this?
he
found
that
she
did
that
the
responsible
officials
authorized
the
making
of
this
agreement.
he
found
that
she
did,
was
the
agreement
ratified
by
the
company?
the
master
found
what
it
did
and
therefore
was
the
agreement
a
valid
contract,
he
found
that
it
was.
now,
almost
every
case,
of
course
like
every
case,
but
most
breach
of
contract
cases
involved
this
kind
of
a
finding.
this
is
the
typical
kind
of
finding
which
is
made
by
courts
which
decide
breach
of
contract
cases.
now,
there
are
other
types
of
cases
in
which
other
concepts
are
involved,
but
we
should
not
assume
that
every
breach
of
contract
matter.
this
maybe
one
of
the
reasons
why
congress
decided
to
put
this
into
the
courts
rather
than
before
the
labor
board.
the
arbitration
decisions
which
your
honors
decided
last
year,
involved
a
question
of
the
substantive
law
--
kind
of
approach
which
should
be
taken
by
the
courts
in
dealing
with
these
matters.
but
once
sent
down
as
a
rule,
it
has
proved
to
be
reasonably
observable,
reasonably
understood
by
everyone
and
enforce
i
may
say
in
state
courts
as
well
as
in
federal
courts.
the
great
problems
that
are
foreseen
by
my
brother
in
dealing
with
these
contract
actions
simply
exist
if
they
exist
only
in
a
few
cases
which
can
be
properly
dealt
with
and
do
not
require
as
a
policy
matter
this
court
to
say
that
even
though
congress
hasn't
said
so
in
order
to
make
a
coherent
hole
of
labor
relations
law,
we
must
vest
this
jurisdiction
in
contract
actions
in
the
federal
district
courts
exclusively.
now,
this
would
create
a
problem
indeed
in
relation
to
the
westinghouse
case.
i
may
say
that
this
case
was
brought
in
the
state
court
because
there
were
some
uncertainties
as
to
whether
it
could
even
be
brought
in
the
federal
court.
in
my
statement
of
facts,
i
neglected
to
state
that
their
only
issue
between
the
company
and
the
union
in
this
case,
although
the
13
cents
was
paid,
the
company
was
in
fact
abiding
by
the
rest
of
the
terms
of
the
contract.
what
they
didn't
want
to
do
is
pay
--
the
company
discovered
that
13
cents
was
too
much
and
they
wanted
to
get
out
of
it
and
i
am
told
that
really
the
only
issue
though
the
company
said
that
the
contract
as
a
whole
was
void
because
it
was
not
properly
negotiated,
the
only
changes
in
that
contract
from
the
one
previous
enforced
were
wage
terms.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
didn't,
the
person
who
brought,
filed
the
suit
which
i
didn't
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
you
may
have
a
new
problem
your
honor,
301
deals
with
one
kind
of
contract,
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
unions
and
employers.
this
court
appeared
to
hold
in
westinghouse
or
at
least
appeared
to
hold
to
some
people,
the
people
who
filed
the
suit,
that
where
money
was
involved
for
individual
wage
earners
as
it
was
here,
the
suit
for
a
breach
of
that
contract
could
not
be
brought
in
the
federal
court
under
301.
mr.
david
e.
feller
there's
no
problem
here.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
have
not
argued
that
because
i
think
it
does
come
within
301.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
because
i
think
for
the
reason
that
my
brother
mason
has
said
the
whole
validity
of
the
contract
is
actually
at
issue
here
though
the
only
thing
they
were
arguing
about
was
money.
in
fact,
the
only
way
which
the
employer
could
get
out
to
paying
the
money
was
to
say
that
the
whole
contract
was
void.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
put
counsel
in
one
very
difficult
situation
when
he
has
to
look
at
each
case
and
say,
‚Äúis
this
westinghouse
type
of
a
case
or
is
this
--
maybe
not?‚Äù
if
he
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
the
meaning
of
a
cause
of
the
contract
instead
of
asking
for
money,
is
this
--
if
you
say
it's
either
exclusively
federal
or
exclusively
state,
the
problems
of
determining
each
way.
now,
my
own
view
is
that
which
i
will
say
that
there's
--
i
haven't
have
any
authority
for
since
the
westinghouse
case
was
decided
as
it
is
--
was.
my
view
which
we
express
in
our
brief
is
that
since
lincoln
mills,
in
fact,
the
westinghouse
case
would
be
decided
otherwise
of
this
court
hasn't
said
so,
but
whether
that
be
so
or
not
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes,
we
do.
mr.
david
e.
feller
alright.
well,
i'm
prepared
to
stick
to
it.
now,
i
think
i'm
just
pointing
out
the
difficulties
which
are
occasioned
if
whether
you
hold
that
this
suit
can
be
brought
or
any
suit
for
a
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
quite
different
matters.
now,
in
my
view,
the
suit
can
be
brought
in
the
federal
court,
it
can
be
brought
in
the
state
court.
if
it
is
brought
in
the
state
court,
it
is
removed.
now,
the
one
question
of
policy
and
your
honor
raised
the
question,
in
the
scheme
of
this
act,
i
think
the
expertise
doesn't
really
matter
because
as
i
said,
these
are
breach
of
contract
actions,
the
congress
has
decided
not
to
give
it
to
the
board
with
the
agency
with
expertise
argued
the
labor
board,
but
the
courts
and
the
federal
district
courts
are
not
the
expert
bodies.
the
one
passed
question
of
policy
in
determining,
assuming
you're
predetermined,
is
the
norris-laguardia
and
that's
a
hard
nut
even
though
it's
not
directly
involved
in
this.
i
think
you
have
to
--
have
some
idea
of
where
this
leads
you
and
my
brother
mason
didn't
make
the
best
argument
he
could
make
on
this
thing
which
is
in
his
brief.
there
is
a
district
court
case
in
which
a
suit
was
brought
for
violation
of
contract
and
an
injunction
and
damages
were
asked.
it
was
sought
to
be
removed
to
the
federal
court.
the
federal
district
court
said
we
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
injunction
part
of
this,
therefore
we'll
send
that
back
to
the
state
court,
to
issue
the
injunction,
but
we'll
keep
the
damage
part
because
that
we
have
jurisdiction
of
and
this
he
argues
is
one
of
the
problems
of
providing
concurrent
jurisdiction.
we
argue
that
in
301
cases,
i'm
not
arguing
about
norris-laguardia
being
applied
broadly
to
the
states
certainly,
but
in
301
cases,
that
the
federal
law
governing
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
is
the
federal
substantive
law
which
this
court
said
is
to
be
applied
in
section
301
suits,
the
federal
law
includes
as
part
of
its
policy,
the
prohibitions
in
section,
embodied
in
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
saying,
‚Äúthere
shall
be
no
injunctions
against
strikes‚Äù
i.e.
no
injunction
can
be
issued
against
the
strike
on
the
ground
that
it
is
in
violation
of
contract.
now,
this
is
not
so
difficult
as
it
may
appear.
certainly,
this
court
has
treated
the
norris-laguardia
act
as
part
of
federal
substantive
law.
the
hutchinson
case
certainly
has
language
to
that
effect.
i'll
indeed
point
out
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
dealing
with
a
case
coming
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
the
speck
case
decided
this
year,
this
court
said
that
it
would
be
not
proper
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
union
shop
contract
because
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
the
policy
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
that
was
a
case
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
let's
go
to
the
steele
case,
steele
versus
louisville
and
national
railway
where
this
court
enforced
the
duty
to
bargain
under
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
act
literally
applies
to
the
state
courts,
obviously
it
doesn't.
i
think
it
expresses
a
federal
substantive
policy
and
if
there's
a
federal
substantive
law
governing
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
this
court
has
said,
it
is
in
lincoln
mills
as
this
court,
i
think
without
the
dissent
from
any
member
applied
in
the
arbitration
cases
last
year.
nobody
suggested
that
these
matters
were
governed
by
state
law
there.
i
suggest
that
part
of
that
substantive
law
is
the
proposition
that
you
do
not
enjoin
a
strike
on
the
allegation
that
it
is
in
violation
of
contract.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
did
not
read
your
honor's
opinion,
the
hutchinson
case
in
that
way
but
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
i
--
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i'm
not
--
i
will
point
out
that
this
court
has
made
that
assumption
not
only
in
the
instance
i
referred
to.
in
the
chicago
river
case
which
this
court
decided
that
norris-laguardia
was
in
the
fact
amended
by
the
railway
labor
act
so
that
injunction
could
be
issued.
it
referred
to
the
steele
case
as
an
example
of
the
fact
that
despite
norris-laguardia,
injunctions
could
be
issued
to
enforce
duties
under
the
railway
labor
act.
the
steele
case
was
a
case
which
came
here
from
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
so
this
court
has
accepted
the
proposition,
implicitly
without
argument,
obviously
not
so
wholly,
but
it
has
looked
to
the
norris-laguardia
act
to
express
a
federal
labor
policy
as
i
think
it
does
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
it
can
be
but
again
you
have
to
decide
a
specific
case
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
you're
in
a
room
and
you
are
looking
to
general
policy
consideration.
mr.
david
e.
feller
but
i
will
say
that
i
would
feel
differently.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
don't
--
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
it
is
not
before
you.
however,
i
think
that
the
only
reason
i
advert
to
it
is
that
it
does
bear
on
the
policy
question
if
your
honor's
feel,
as
i
think
you
have
a
right
to
feel
that
in
determining
whether
this
jurisdiction
is
exclusive,
you
have
to
decide
how
this
fits
into
the
scheme
of
the
labor
relations
policy
set
forth
in
the
statute.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i'm
going
to
deal
with
this.
this
is
my
final
point,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
david
e.
feller
now
in
section
301,
this
particular
provision,
which
had
been
referred
to,
talks
about
301
language,
which
simply
says
that
suits
maybe
brought
in
the
district
court.
there
is
a
difference
between
this
language
and
the
language
in
the
section
303.
so
the
only
other
language
which
i
think
is
relevant
by
analogy
and
only
by
analogy.
section
303
also
creates
a
federal
substantive
right
in
terms,
it
says
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
the
purpose
of
the
section
to
do
certain
things
and
says,
‚Äúwhoever
shall
be
injured
by
result
of
conduct
in
violation
of
the
section
that
may
sue
in
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
or
in
any
other
court
having
jurisdiction
to
the
parties,
an
explicit
grant
of
jurisdiction
both
to
federal
and
to
the
state
courts.‚Äù
now,
it
is
argued
and
i
think
this
is
the
only
statutory
language
argument
which
can
be
made
in
this
case
that
the
fact
that
congress
so
provided
in
section
303,
makes
it
clear
that
as
i
say
it
knew
how
to
give
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
and
in
301
it
didn't.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
don't
regard
those
as
your
argument
--
your
honor
is
asking
as
to
whether
the
question
as
to
service,
i
think
those
apply
in
the
federal
courts.
i
assume
you
will
serve
in
the
state
court
as
you
serve
in
the
state
court.
mr.
david
e.
feller
alright
your
honor
i'll
address
myself
to
those
if
i'm
finished
with
303.
now,
the
reason
for
303
is
different
from
301
are
two
folds.
mr.
david
e.
feller
unfortunately,
i
think
no
one
--
none
of
us
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
guilty
as
charged
your
honor.
that's
all
i
can
say
we
were.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no
i
have
no
monopoly
and
i
will
say
since
i'm
answering
an
argument
made
by
the
petitioner,
i
think
probably
it
is
his
first
responsibility
to
refer
to
303,
but
i
concede
we
should
have
printed
303
in
any
case
whether
he
did
it
or
not.
but
the
important
thing
in
303
is
that
it
created
a
cause
of
action
in
the
courts
for
what
was
otherwise
created
in
the
act
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
in
other
words,
congress
created
a
brand
new
substantive
law
and
said
it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
words
in
the
303
are
exactly
the
same
as
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
and
made
--
this
is
the
secondary
boycott
which
was
made
on
unfair
labor
practice
and
congress
in
this
case
and
in
this
case
only
said,
‚Äúeven
though
we
have
made
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
it's
the
kind
of
thing
where
we
have
a
confident,
specialized
tribunal
which
is
supposed
to
have
exclusive
jurisdiction,
we're
also
going
to
create
a
cause
of
action.‚Äù
now
in
that
case,
we
have
a
very
good
argument
where
they
said
only
the
federal
court,
but
that
meant
since
it
is
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
area
that
only
the
federal
court
could
have
jurisdiction.
they
have
a
wonderful
argument
for
exclusive
jurisdiction
if
they
use
ambiguous
language
there.
the
jurisdiction
had
to
be
given
explicitly
to
the
state
court
because
you
are
creating
--
you
are
giving
a
cause
of
action
for
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes,
because
we
are
not
suing
because
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
david
e.
feller
you're
not
construing
--
in
that
case,
you
are
not
construing
the
language
of
the
statute
as
to
what
is
a
secondary
boycott,
a
very
difficult
question.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
but
the
difference
is
if
your
honor
please
that
when
you
are
suing
under
the
unfair
labor
practice
thing,
the
substantive
law
which
has
to
be
adjudicated
and
interpreted
is
the
particular
federal
statute,
the
unfair
labor
practice,
which
congress
has
said
this
is
--
and
this
court
knows
and
--
on
review
of
those
things
(8)
(b)
(4)
and
the
secondary
boycott
provision
or
the
one
with
the
most
mysterious
set
of
words
that
were
put
in
the
statute.
this
is
a
very
difficult
thing
and
therefore
the
normal
presumption
is
that
you
don't
allow
state
courts
to
decide
that
kind
of
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
the
mystery
doesn't
evaporate,
but
what
you
decide,
you
decide
what
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
means,
you
don't
decide
what
that
statute
means.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
correct.
the
different
words
as
your
honor
knows
can
very
often
have
a
different
meaning
depending
on
whether
they're
in
the
statute
or
in
a
contract
or
somewhere
else.
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
same
words,
the
same
words
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
depending
on
many
other
things,
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
your
honor,
if
--
if
the
same
words
are
put
in
to
collectively
bargaining
agreement,
let's
take
the
simple
case
where
it
is
said
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
on
account
of
union
activity,
a
common
provision
in
collective
bargaining
agreements,
commonly
arbitrated.
most
of
these
collective
bargaining
agreements
provide
(inaudible)
provision.
i
do
not
know
that
a
decision
by
an
arbitrator,
that
a
particular
kind
of
conduct
constitutes
discrimination
or
non-discrimination
under
that
collective
bargaining
thing
is
the
same
determination
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
makes
in
adjudicating
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
david
e.
feller
even
though
that
the
words
maybe
the
same,
i
can
come
to
an
arbitrator
and
prevent
--
present
history,
not
of
the
legislative
history,
i
don't
go
to
senate
committee
reports
when
i'm
arbitrating
a
case
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
if
i
bring
in
any
materials,
i
bring
in
materials
as
to
what
the
company
said
and
what
the
union
said
on
how
we
got
in
to
these
words.
i
don't
bring
in
senate
conference
committee
report
as
to
what
the
words
were
used
in
the
congress
--
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
even
though
the
words
maybe
the
same.
mr.
david
e.
feller
we
have
different
legislative
enactment.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
it.
we
have
the
303
provisions
against
secondary
boycotts
into
a
contract.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
i
didn't
say
that
section
303
provision,
i've
never
seen
such
a
thing
and
i
don't
know
what
union
or
what
company
would
provide
that.
i
said,
what
is
the
common
thing
is
for
a
union
to
provide
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
in
its
union
members.
303
is
a
secondary
boycott
provision.
mr.
david
e.
feller
it's
enforceable
whether
as
a
damage
suit
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
contract.
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
the
--
when
i
say
the
usual
contract,
the
case
i
put
is
a
case
in
which,
let
me
put
‚Äì
there
is
the
case
pending
on
your
honor's
docket
right
now
when
certiorari
was
filed
last
spring.
union
provides
in
a
contract
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
against
union
members.
this
is
the
kind
of
provision
which
as
i
say
is
usual
in
most
contracts,
95%
of
the
contracts
provide
arbitration
provisions
and
normally,
these
things
are
adjudicated.
the
man
is
discharged,
supposedly
for
not
showing
up
on
time.
the
union
says
it
wasn't
for
that
reason.
the
real
reason
is
because
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
grievance
committee,
so
you
file
a
grievance.
in
the
case
which
pending
before
your
honors,
the
company
says
we
won't
arbitrate
that.
the
reason
we
won't
arbitrate
is
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
what
you
say
is
true.
and
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
said,
‚Äúthat's
right.
this
is
preempted
by
the
federal
act.‚Äù
now
i
said
that
that
isn't
so,
that
even
though
it
may
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
the
provision
in
the
contract
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
against
union
members
is
identical
with
the
statutory
prohibition
against
discrimination
against
(voice
overlap)
union
membership.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right,
remediable
as
provided
in
this
case,
remediable
through
arbitration.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
that's
the
problem.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
the
whole
point
i
was
trying
to
make
your
honor
and
i
think
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
a
red
herring
in
this
business
and
the
whole
discussion
--
i
was
trying
to
say
that
even
though
in
another
aspect,
the
same
conduct
could
come
before
the
board.
it
is
a
red
herring
and
if
we're
in
agreement
on
that,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
for
all
the
examples.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
suggest
to
your
honors
the
answer
to
your
honor's
difficulty
is
that
it
is
no
more
anomalous
to
allow
the
state
court
judge
to
decide
that
question
that
it
is
to
allow
the
district
court
judge
to
decide
that
question.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
my
answer
to
that
is
i
concede
that
the
scope
of
reviewing
this
court
maybe
somewhat
different
in
a
jury
case
from
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts,
but
i
confess
that
i
could
not
for
myself
decide
that
congress
in
this
statute
decided
to
exclude
the
state
courts
from
jurisdiction,
but
to
allow
the
federal
district
courts
who
have
no
unfair
labor
practice
jurisdiction
to
decide
them
because
of
the
difference
of
the
scope
of
the
review
of
a
possible
jury
verdict.
i
just
don't
think
that's
a
sufficient
consideration
to
come
to
that
conclusion
and
i
don't
know
of
any
other
consideration
which
is
sufficient
to
argue
that.
the
federal
district
courts
are
just
as
foreign
to
unfair
labor
practice
matters
except
incidentally
as
are
the
state
courts.
they
are
given
no
jurisdiction
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
other
than
--
and
i'm
talking
about
the
national
labor
relations
act
not
the
labor
management
relations
act,
the
part
which
deals
with
the
labor
board,
other
than
to
hear
cases
for
temporary
relief
and
really
the
treatment
of
congress
as
dealing
with
those
cases
is
illustrative
because
you
go
in
and
if
you
allege
that
there
is
sufficient
cause
to
believe
that
there
maybe
an
unfair
labor
practice,
you
go
in
and
you
ask
the
district
judge
for
an
injunction.
indeed,
the
general
counsel
in
the
case
where
this
is
so
provided
in
10
(l)
of
the
act
is
required
to
go
in
and
ask
for
an
injunction.
the
injunction
is
issued
but
that
district
court
never
decides
the
case.
it
goes
to
the
board,
the
board
decides
it
and
very
gratefully
decides
it
differently
than
what
the
general
counsel
argues
in
the
nature
of
things
that
he
doesn't
win
all
of
these
cases,
and
the
court
of
appeals
decides
in
a
completely
independent
proceeding
from
the
federal
district
court.
so
i
suggest
that
all
of
the
arguments
for
federal,
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
here
and
there
are
some
good
ones
are
arguments
which
really
go
to
the
proposition
that
congress
should
have
really
made
this
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
those
arguments
are
not
permissible
here.
congress
decided
to
put
it
in
the
courts.
there
are
equally
good
arguments
i
think
for
saying
that
the
kind
of
issue,
there
are
enough
cases
involving
the
kind
of
issue
that's
involved
in
this
case
for
simply
authorization,
ratification
approval
or
the
typical
case
which
congress
was
thinking
about,
which
is
a
suit
for
damages
for
a
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
congress
wasn't
really
thinking
about
--
too
much
about
these
or
provided
both
way
jurisdictions.
it
was
thinking
about
a
case
where
union
as
contacted
that
these
will
be
the
terms
and
conditions
for
two
years
and
there
shall
be
no
strikes
and
the
union
says,
‚Äúwe
didn't
like
it,
we're
going
to
go
and
strike.‚Äù
and
it
wanted
to
provide
a
method
by
which
unions
could
be
sued
for
damages,
for
breach
of
that
kind
of
thing.
they
are
being
sued
today.
i
will
say
this
case
is
unusual.
i
think
the
question
was
asked
by
you
mr.
justice
black
as
to
what
the
usual
course.
all
the
decisions
we've
been
able
to
find
except
one
obscure
dictum
and
the
footnote
in
the
westinghouse
case,
all
say
that
the
state
courts
have
jurisdiction.
they
are
in
fact
exercising
their
jurisdiction
without
question
enforcing
federal
law
through
--
over
the
country.
steelworkers,
i
know
are
now
involved
in
two
damage
suits,
one
in
the
state
court
in
minnesota
and
one
in
the
state
court
in
california
in
which
i
will
confess,
i
never
thought
to
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
the
jurisdiction
was
exclusive.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
can
only
say
--
since
i
can
only
know
the
suits
which
i
know
about,
i
don't
know
about
all
of
them.
the
only
cases
i
know
about
is
this
case
and
the
three
cases
which
your
honors
decided
june
1960
which
were
the
arbitration
cases,
which
were
all
steelworkers
cases
and
all
started
in
federal
district
courts.
mr.
david
e.
feller
have
i
initiated
in
the
state
courts
how
many,
those
three
cases.
one
of
them
i
did
--
two
of
them
i
did,
two,
the
american
manufacturing
case
and
warring
gulf
case.
the
enterprise
case,
i
never
heard
of
until
the
court
of
appeals
--
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals.
this
case,
i
didn't
hear
about
until
petition
for
cert
was
filed.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
there
are
very
good
arguments
why
you
should
setup
a
scheme
in
which
there
is
no
court
enforcement,
but
board
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
that's
what
i
meant
to
say
if
i
didn't
say
that.
and
if
--
but
those
arguments
were
addressed
to
congress
and
rejected
by
congress
when
it
decided
that
court
enforcement
was
the
way
to
handle
this
question.
i
think
there
are
very
good
arguments
the
other
way
because
many
of
these
cases
involved
complex
questions
as
to
damages,
really
this
is
probably
--
that
--
in
this
case
the
damage
question
was
easy,
it
was
back
pay.
employer
lawsuits
involved
complex
questions
of
damages
and
one
damage
suit
which
the
steelworkers
are
involved,
we've
had
four
months
trial
on
the
question
of
damages
proving
profits
lost
to
profit's
not
lost
so
that
these
can
be
very
difficult.
it
may
be
that
congress
decided
that
this
kind
of
a
question
was
better
left
to
the
usual
processes
of
law.
the
courts
are
used
to
deciding
this
question
and
when
they
made
that
decision
and
this
is
really
our
argument,
i
see
no
reason
to
assume
that
they
said
by
the
usual
processes
of
law,
they
meant
only
the
federal
district
courts
and
not
the
state
courts
which
had
been
exercising
that
kind
of
jurisdiction
all
along.
that
--
301
at
--
with
the
gloss
that
has
been
put
on
it
by
this
court's
interpretation
contains
the
source
of
the
substantive
rules
to
govern
these
lawsuits
in
which
i
will
say
90%
of
the
law
in
most
of
the
cases
will
be
state
anyway,
but
absorbed
as
federal
law
such
as
we
have
in
this
case.
when
you
have
authority
--
who
has
authority,
that
law
will
be
enforced
through
the
state
courts
as
it
has
been
and
it's
now
being
done
just
as
it
can
be
in
the
federal
courts
and
there's
no
basis
for
reading
the
jurisdiction
in
this
case
as
--
granted
this
case
as
being
exclusively
federal
and
depriving
the
state
courts
of
jurisdiction
in
the
cases
where
both
parties
are
--
will
accept
the
state
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
e.
feller
now,
the
norris-laguardia
question
i
said
was
an
arguable
of
question.
i
will
say
your
honor
that
i
was
a
bit
surprised
that
the
removal
question
raised
in
a
contract.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
assumed
this
is
--
it
is
not
here.
mr.
david
e.
feller
but
i
assume
that
some
things
have
to
be
assumed
as
given
in
terms
of
the
policy
of
a
given
statute.
i
will
say
frankly,
i
have
assumed
it
to
be
given
and
not
subject
to
argument
that
a
suit
brought
under
a
suit
to
vindicate
a
collective
--
a
substantive
collective
bargaining
right
granted
by
federal
law
if
brought
in
the
state
court
could
be
removed
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
right
is
granted
by
the
contract
whether
it's
enforceable
pursuant
to
the
sub
--
federal
substantive
law
governing
collective
bargaining
agreements
established
by
301.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
correct
and
i
have
assumed
and
every
court
which
has
had
opportunity
to
address
itself
to
the
subject
has
assumed
without
controversy
so
far
and
as
i
know
that
such
a
lawsuit
is
removable.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
it
maybe
but
i
will
say
that
federal
employers
liability
act
specifically
provided
for
suits
in
the
state
courts
and
for
suits
in
the
federal
courts
and
the
question
then
was
having
specifically
provided
for
both
if
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
may
argue
with
you
in
that
your
honor.
