justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mason,
i
take
it
that
we
start
with
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
solve
this
problem
for
us.
we
have
to
solve
it
for
congress.
it
doesn't
say
shall
be
exclusively
nor
does
it
say
shall
also
be
in
any
state
or
any
court
having
jurisdiction.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
we
haven't
got
a
federal
employer's
liability
problem
and
we
haven't
--
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
have
you
--
you
just
made
a
generalize
statement.
your
argument
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
although
it
didn't
say
exclusively,
it
meant
exclusively
and
the
respondent's
argument
was
on
the
fact
because
it
didn't
say
exclusively,
didn't
mean
exclusively,
that's
what
the
congress
is
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
as
bearing
under
--
on
the
resolution
of
those
two
contradicted
provisions,
i
myself
for
instance
would
be
interested
to
get
light
on
various
statutes,
various
statutes,
not
only
labor
statutes
--
statutes
under
the
--
it
consists
of
act
taft-hartley
or
the
wagner
et
cetera,
the
various
statutes
in
which
congress
has
fermented
litigation,
not
consciously,
but
inevitably
and
i
wonder
if
either
you
have
collected
all
the
relevant
statutes
as
guidelines
as
illumination
in
finding
--
to
extracting
a
purpose
either
of
exclusion
or
inclusion
from
the
structure
of
a
statute.
have
you
done
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
can
toss
up
a
coin.
we
can
argue
about
consequences,
pro
and
con
and
so
on
and
then
i
hope
there
would
be
a
very
little
talk
about
the
intention
of
congress
which
you
evidently
didn't
have
because
it
didn't
express
it.
so
where
do
we
--
i
would
like
to
have
some
road
map.
that's
what
i'm
looking
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i'm
not
saying
i'm
the
duty.
i'm
saying
that
i've
got
a
duty
on
which
--
which
is
addressed
in
a
dark
room.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
a
very
part
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
some
other
length,
i
mean
the
specific
--
the
specific
statute
you
have
to
construe
doesn't
shed
very
much
light,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
the
specific
statute.
i
beg
your
pardon,
specific
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right
and
you
move
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
a
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
that,
but
the
guss
case
shows
that
this
court
derived
exclusion
from
policy
considerations,
consequences
of
not
exclusive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
in
a
different
field
in
the
interstate
commerce
field,
but
then
it
happened
in
all
case,
this
court
construed
or
practically
chloroformed
the
provision
which
said
the
common
law
rights
survived
because
if
it
has
to
construe
it
--
if
it
had
to
give
respect
literally
to
that
section,
it
would've
been
notified
the
purpose
of
the
rest
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
was
(inaudible)
mr.
mason
is
that
--
although
a
substantive
matter
as
we
play
with
words,
substantive
procedure,
these
are
essentially
--
litigation
is
to
be
conducted
against
whom
and
congress
would
hardly
have
provided
a
code
of
procedural
--
a
code
of
procedure
for
the
conduct
of
litigation
in
all
the
50
states
and
therefore,
sub
silencio
left
all
those
matters
to
local
jurisdiction.
i
am
not
saying
that's
a
full
answer
to
you
but
it
is
--
that's
what
you'd
had
to
come
down
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you
mr.
mason.
why
--
why
does
the
argument
opposed
--
the
conclusion
opposed
to
yours
implicate
the
relevance
of
norris-laguardia,
the
state
courts
never
occurred
to
me
that
it
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
mean
never
occurred
to
me
that
norris-laguardia
was
applicable
to
courts.
indeed
states
have
to
pass
separate
norris-laguardia
act
as
your
state
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
like
your
--
i
like
your
phrase
mr.
mason.
the
accident
of
litigation
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
call
the
initiation
of
a
litigation
by
a
plaintiff
an
accident?
justice
felix
frankfurter
accident
for
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
clients
in
the
habit
of,
i
think
they're
a
console
between
either
a
state
or
a
federal
court?
i'm
just
asking
that
as
a
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
mason,
i
don't
think
this
logical
argument
of
yours
will
serve
as
an
estoppel
to
mr.
feller.
if
you
sue
him
in
the
state
court
assuming
this
judgment
was
affirmed,
that
wouldn't
have
estop
him
not
to
raise
the
question
that
on
the
massachusetts
law
he's
not
an
entity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
your
comprehensive
organic
discussion
and
not
--
they
can
choose
it,
but
they
didn't.
in
other
word
--
in
other
words,
jurisdiction
which
doesn't
recognize
an
unincorporated
association
as
a
suable
entity
might
have
to
recognize
it
for
purposes
of
301
litigation
but
for
nothing
else
that
ever
is
litigated
in
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mason,
may
i
ask
this
question?
this
is
an
equity
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
went
to
a
master,
but
if
this
jurisdiction
is
sustained,
you
may
have
suits
on
the
law
side,
i
mean
you're
not
--
but
you're
not
under
301.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
if
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
under
301,
there
maybe
cases
involving
jury
suit
cases,
are
they
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
you
might
have
act,
on
the
law
side
and
therefore
juries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
is
that
too
fanciful
as
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
even
--
i
was
going
to
say
under
your
equity
(inaudible).
now
nay
there
--
if
this
jurisdiction
was
sustained,
i'm
groping
around
because
i
told
you
before
lunch
i
was
getting
a
little
out
of
the
dark
room
but
it
seems
(inaudible),
bow,
assuming
you've
got
jury
trial,
jury
case,
and
submissions
of
questions
from
the
jury
and
findings
of
verdicts
by
juries
on
the
basis
of
finding
--
it's
open
for
them
to
make
considering
the
limited
nature
of
the
review
unless
there
are
clear
rulings
on
law
but
what
i'm
getting
at
is
may
there
not
be
questions
of
law
so
entangled
with
finding
the
facts
by
the
jury
that's
on
review
would
be
impossible
to
extract
the
entanglement
of
law
in
the
jury's
finding
of
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
it's
cognizable
also
in
the
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
it
is
in
my
mind
is
the
considerations
that
underlay
the
(inaudible)
cases
if
you'll
probably
permit
it.
namely
that
if
you
allow
common
law
action,
the
common
law
action
that
exists
when
the
interstate
commerce
act
was
passed
namely
that
any
unreasonable
charge
allows
you
to
bring
an
action
of
individuated
with
the
recovery
of
the
excess.
you
get
a
verdict
from
a
jury
and
it'll
be
hard
to
extract
from
that,
what
part
of
it
was
the
reviewable
question
of
law
and
what
part
of
it
was
within
the
province
of
the
jury.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
kind
of
a
problem,
that
kind
of
a
danger
implicit
in
the
line
of
state
court
jurisdiction
concurrent
with
the
federal
court
because
if
there's
a
limitation
upon
the
reviewability
because
of
the
intervention
of
the
jury,
then
you
may
have
defeated
the
legal
questions
so
non-reviewable,
so
non-reviewable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
would
but
there's
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
a
supervising
--
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
over
a
federal
court
and
non-supervising
court
for
the
united
states
for
50
state
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
that
mr.
mason,
since
we
are
told
that
this
one
is
a
great
stimulus
to
juristic
inventiveness,
you'll
have
50
energetic
inventive
jurisdictions
instead
of
just
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
make
an
assumption
for
the
state
law
or
universal
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
only
a
temporary
even
because
you
can
always
come
up
here
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
not
be
(inaudible),
but
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
interest
of
jurisprudence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
heard
(voice
overlap),
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
requirement
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
held
the
opposite,
if
it's
the
federal
employer
liability
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
so
specifically
stated
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't
show.
well,
that's
the
point
that
justice
stewart
is
making.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
feller,
your
assurance
on
that
subject
doesn't
bind
that
---
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
had
--
the
court
divided
closely
on
the
question
whether
the
general
removal
statute
does
or
doesn't
apply
in
the
federal
employers
liability
act
and
the
consideration
that's
prevailed
now
that
there
may
be
--
may
not
be
removed
where
policy
consideration
is
drawn
out
of
the
purposes
of
legislation
and
nothing
that
you
now
say
can
permanently
or
effectively
or
authoratively
negated
such
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
case
--
the
problem
is
abstractly
either
as
you
put
it
and
may
--
there
are
maybe
today,
1961,
lawyers
like
mr.
louis
d.
brandeis
during
his
long
years
of
practice
in
massachusetts
made
is
possible
never
to
remove
a
removable
case
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court
for
professional
consideration
in
the
wise
conduct
of
a
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
301
is
preoccupied
with
the
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
mr.
feller,
am
i
wrong
in
speaking
that
in
construing
such
pervasive
technical
complicated
provision
as
collective
bargaining,
the
interpretation
of
what
the
collective
bargaining
mean
does
not
exclude
--
does
not
--
is
not
holding
without
life
from
what
may
or
may
not
be
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
legal
--
that
they're
in
different
legal
cubbyholes.
i'm
saying
something
very
different
namely
that
when
it
comes
to
construing
particularly
by
judged
to
what
things
mean,
what
is
allowed,
what
is
permitted,
what
is
required
by
collective
bargaining
agreements,
there
is
cross
like
problem,
what
may
if
so
construed
constitute
on
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
that's
all
i'm
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
presumably,
district
court
or
district
judges
agree
with
the
opinion,
the
courts
of
appeals
particularly
their
circuits,
i
should
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
sit
in
courts
of
appeals
again
and
again
district
judges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
--
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
vested
with
the
opinion
that
justice
(inaudible)
that
kind
of
thing
going
way
back.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
but
my
interest
derive
from
a
desire
for
a
closest
scrutiny
of
whether
in
those
cases
you
had
policy
consideration
which
--
whatever
or
whatsoever
you
may
finally
assess
them
are
for
me
present
in
this
case
which
are
not
present
but
there
is
one
present
in
the
--
in
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
bankruptcy
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
various
other
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
feller,
if
you
say
--
if
you
will
tell
us
that
our
decisions,
rarely
do
our
decisions
require
me
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
state
courts
in
subject
to
the
constitution
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
must
enforce
federally
created
right
unless
congress
explicitly
makes
enforcing
judiciary
solely
the
federal
judiciary
unless
you
tell
me
that
i'm
--
that
the
requirement
of
my
reading
of
the
cases
(inaudible),
if
you
don't
say
that
then
we
are
driven
--
then
i
don't
get
much
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
almost.
well
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
has
said
so
in
several
other
statutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand,
correct
me.
you
said
you
had
doubt
whether
this
could
be
brought
in
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whoever
did
it?
there
was
doubt,
if
this
arises
on
the
contract
and
it
doesn't
fall
under
301,
it
isn't
--
that
kind
of
--
does
301
deal
with
a
particular
kind
of
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
that
so
then
i
got
a
new
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
301
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
they're
very
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
either
that
is
an
issue
or
it
isn't?
if
it's
an
issue,
it
is
issuable
in
the
federal
court
and
if
it
isn't
issuable
under
301
in
the
federal
court,
there's
no
problem
for
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
stand
there,
do
you
say
this
litigation
could
have
been
brought
under
301
in
the
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
let's
stick
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
me,
norris-laguardia
or
substantive
law
with
reference
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
and
not
substantive
industrial
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
that
this
--
it
gets
the
difficulties
that
we
have
that
you
--
with
at
large
on
this
invented
motion
and
now
we
have
indirectly
to
decide
here
or
whether
if
we
decide
this
norris-laguardia
to
be
part
of
substantive
law
in
the
301.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you're
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
other
--
you're
coming
together
provisions
of
the
statute,
which
deals
explicitly,
which
is
used
from
the
301.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
we
are
in
the
less
speculative
area
there
because
you
got
to
use
the
expression
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
procedural
provision
(inaudible)
in
service?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
being
decisive
because
we're
picking
pieces,
putting
the
bits
and
pieces
together.
i'm
just
offering
that
you
should
base
on
(inaudible)
bits
and
pieces.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
parsimonious
in
giving
us
the
statutory
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
that
same
unfair
labor
practice
is
made
part
of
the
agreement,
it
becomes
part
of
the
contract
and
then
you
can
sue
it
in
the
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
your
suggestion
that
if
you
make
a
contract
that
the
fellow
shouldn't
hit
you
in
the
face
--
if
you
put
it
in
the
contract
then
you
sue
his
contract.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the
very
same
fact,
very
same
consideration,
very
same
arguments
pro
and
con
can
be
brought
and
can
be
utilized
and
address
to
the
state
court
if
it's
part
of
the
collective
agreement
although
it's
part
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
must
be
brought
in
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
put
it
in
--
if
you
put
it
in
terms
in
a
collective
agreement
then
the
mystery
evaporates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
those
are
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
point
is
that
it
wouldn't
depend
on
any
other
thing
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
it
wouldn't
depend
on
any
other
thing.
if
the
same
words
are
put
in
the
collective
agreement,
it
would
depend
on
anything
else
except
that
the
superior
court
judge
in
massachusetts
would
be
deciding
it
instead
of
judge
ford
in
the
federal
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
problem
i'm
putting
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
problem
i'm
putting
to
you
is
that
provision
in
a
collective
agreement
therefore
part
of
the
contract,
violation
of
which
is
suable
in
the
federal
court.
i'm
saying
that
in
that
kind
of
a
thing
you
can
sue
either
the
federal
court
rather
than
the
state
court,
although
you've
got
the
same
303
provision,
namely
written
in
a
contract
and
the
only
difference
is
different
between
six
or
three
or
two
or
five,
negligence
suit
arriving
out
of
the
same
accident,
taught
before
different
juries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
put
into
the
contract.
you
said
that's
a
very
common
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
your
(voice
overlap)
you
put
it
into
a
contract.
you
put
an
unfair
labor
practice,
you
put
in
a
situation
which
may
become
an
issue
before
the
national
labor
of
relations
board
into
a
contract,
breach
of
it
as
such
is
enforceable
in
a
damage
suit
because
it's
about
issue
of
a
contract,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
remediable
in
the
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
i'm
talking
where
there's
no
arbitration
agreement,
just
a
contract
without
any
arbitration
procedure
that
can
be
enforceable
as
an
ordinary
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
therefore,
our
problem
is
whether
that
contract
is
in
enforceable
for
a
federal
court
and
a
state
court.
i
don't
--
for
me
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
already
red
herring
in
this
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
take
care
of
my
problem
namely
that
--
namely
that
something
which
although
in
one
aspect
is
an
administratively
determinable
thing
may
become
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract
as
such
suable
in
the
federal
courts
for
breach
and
our
problem
is
whether
the
federal
court
or
the
state
court
that
the
state
court
would
be
called
upon
to
deal
with
matters
which
intrinsically
also
implicate
unfair
labor
practices.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
as
such
--
not
as
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
indicated
why
i
don't
think
that's
so
because
the
conclusion
that
are
embedded
in
the
jury
verdict
from
which
it's
very
difficult
so
far
as
state
courts
are
concerned
to
extract
what
is
the
non-reviewable
as
against
the
reviewable
ingredient.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
suits
have
the
steelworkers
initiated
in
the
state
courts
for
a
breach
of
contract
against
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
--
have
you
in
your
responsibility
initiated
in
the
state
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
--
when
you
say
there's
a
very
good
argument
that
can
be
made
for
exclusiveness
in
the
federal
court,
did
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
feller,
you
could
--
couldn't
have
--
you
couldn't
make
a
bigger
assumption
to
that
effect
that
i
made
before
the
federal
employer
rather
it's
decided
by
(inaudible),
you
couldn't
be
more
--
you
couldn't
have
been
clearer
that
that's
the
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
what
the
question
was.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
fallibility
maybe
greater
than
yours.
