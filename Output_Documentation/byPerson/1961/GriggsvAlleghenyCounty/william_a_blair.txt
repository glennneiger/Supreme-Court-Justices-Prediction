mr.
william
a.
blair
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
your
honorable
court
on
the
laws
of
a
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
involves
an
eminent
domain
proceedings
before
a
board
of
viewers
which
made
an
award
to
the
petitioner
for
the
taking
of
an
easement
over
his
airspace
by
reason
of
the
flight
of
planes
in
and
out
of
the
greater
pittsburgh
airport
owned
by
the
county
of
allegheny.
the
award
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
common
pleas.
our
exceptions
filed
embracing
simply
the
question
of
risk
of
liability
of
the
county
for
the
taking.
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
reversed
--
reversed
the
lower
court
and
then
set
aside
the
award
made
to
the
petitioner
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
county
of
allegheny
did
not
operate
the
planes
involved
in
going
to
and
from
the
airport.
the
question
before
of
this
court
seems
to
us
then
is
as
to
whether
or
not,
on
the
undisputed
facts
in
this
case,
the
respondent
took
property
of
the
petitioner
and
the
petitioner
has
been
deprived
of
his
property
without
due
process
in
violation
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
petitioner
under
authority
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
causby
328
--
or
328
u.s.
at
page
256
that
the
regular,
frequent,
and
necessary
low
flights
of
the
planes
over
the
plaintiffâ€™s
property
in
order
--
of
petitioner's
property
in
order
to
get
to
and
from
this
airport
constant
--
which
interfered
with
this
proper
use
and
enjoinment
of
property
constitute
a
taking
and
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
just
compensation
from
the
county
which
owns
airport.
the
causby
case,
as
you
may
recall,
involved
flights
of
bomber
planes
operated
by
united
states
government
in
19
--
around
1942
at
greensboro.
the
government
there
had
leased
the
airport
and
the
planes,
the
bombers
and
other
heavy
military
craft
flew
over
the
property
of
the
causby
family
which
operated
a
chicken
farm.
their
property
was
located
on
a
guide
path
or
approach
zone
leading
from
the
airport
and
the
planes
passed
over
at
a
height
as
it
was
testified
and
shown
in
that
case
as
low
as
83
feet.
as
a
consequence
of
this
regular
constant
flights
the
chickens,
were
--
some
of
them
were
killed
and
were
affected
so
that
the
causby
family
had
to
give
up
operating
the
chicken
farm
and
in
addition
to
that,
by
reason
of
the
noise,
the
vibration,
the
lights,
they
were
disturbed
in
their
regular
occupancy
and
became
frightened
and
nervous.
the
court
of
claims
made
an
award
to
the
causbys
on
a
basis
that
there
had
been
depreciation
in
the
value
of
the
property
in
the
taking.
the
government
appealed
to
this
court
on
the
ground
that
these
flights
were
lawful
flights
that
they
were
made
within
the
navigable
airspace
as
defined
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
and
therefore,
were
lawful
privileged
flights.
this
court
said
briefly
that
those
flights
were
not
privileged
that
the
space
below
the
safe
navigable
airspace
of
500
feet
or
thousand
feet
heading
upon
the
location
of
property
was
not
within
the
navigable
airspace
as
defined
in
the
civil
aeronautics
act
of
1926
and
also
on
1930
of
rather
the
air
commerce
act
of
1926
and
of
civil
aeronautics
act
of
1938.
our
situation
is
similar
to
that
of
causby
in
their
public
use.
the
county
of
allegheny
sometime
prior
to
1952,
determined
that
the
existing
airport
facilities
were
not
adequate
for
the
public
of
allegheny
county.
they
acquired
an
extensive
acreage
in
the
western
part
of
the
county
and
proceeded
to
lay
out
an
airport.
this
was
in
the
vicinity
of
the
--
our
petitioner's
property
and
included
in
the
arrangements
for
the
airport
or
the
plans
for
the
airport
is
what
they
called
a
master
plan.
now
this
master
plan
showed
the
runways,
the
three
runways
and
also
the
approach
zones
to
those
runways
which
must
be
followed
by
planes
entering
and
leaving
the
airport.
in
addition,
under
the
federal
airport
act
which
was
passed
in
1946,
the
county
of
allegheny
made
application
as
the
sponsor
to
the
civil
aeronautics
authorities
for
the
grant
of
funds.
i
should
say
that
the
master
plan
had
to
be
approved
by
the
civil
aeronautics
authority
here
in
washington
and
it
was
approved.
in
addition,
as
i
say,
they
made
application
for
funds
under
this
federal
aid
to
airports
as
a
result
of
which,
they
didn't
get
extensive
or
quite
large
sums
of
money
to
aid
in
the
building
of
the
airport
and
enter
into
agreements
with
the
federal
government
could
--
in
which
included
among
other
things
agreement
that
they
would
get
--
they
were
to
adopt
zoning
ordinances
or
obtain
easements
in
airspace
where
necessary
in
order
to
permit
the
safe
operation
of
planes
in
and
out
of
the
airport.
now,
the
petitioner's
property
is
located
on
the
northeast
approach
zone
and
that
is
the
zone
leading
to
the
northeast
runway.
it's
about
3200
feet
from
the
end
of
the
approach
zone.
i
might
say
that
the
approach
zone
as
shown
on
these
master
plan
extends
from
the
airport
at
the
end
of
the
runway
a
distance
of
10,000
feet
northeast
from
the
airport
on
a
path
and
glider
on
gradient
of
42:1
which
means
for
every
foot
forward
it
rises
one
foot.
our
property
is
situated
probably
about
30
feet
higher
than
the
level
of
the
airport
so
that
on
the
glide
angle,
the
approach
to
and
from
this
airport,
the
planes
on
the
glide
angle
would
be
according
to
the
testimony
in
the
record,
about
12
feet
above
the
chimney
of
the
petitioner's
property.
after
the
opening,
the
airport
was
opened
on
june
1st,
1952
by
--
pursuant
to
a
resolution
of
the
board
of
county
commissioners
other
--
the
board
of
view
found
as
result
of
its
independent
investigation
and
testimony
taken
before,
and
said
as
what
we
found
in
directly
the
page
33,
since
the
opening
of
the
airport
in
northeast
runway
and
its
approach
area
has
been
on
regular
operational
use
for
landing
and
taking
off
of
commercial
and
other
aircraft
in
regular
flight
patterns
of
heights
near
and
over
petitioner's
residence
from
take
off
has
been
from
30
to
300
feet
and
on
let
down
from
53
to
153
feet.
the
result
of
this
operation
is
constant
operation,
a
regular
operation.
the
board
says,
the
low
flight
of
the
aircraft
over
petitioner's
property
interfered
with
this
existing
use
and
enjoinment.
the
interference
resulted
from
noise,
disturbances
and
vibrations
were
created
by
such
airplanes
as
well
as
the
fear
for
personal
safety
caused
by
the
low
flights
in
close
proximity
to
the
petitioner's
residence.
the
said
noise
of
planes
over
petitioner's
property,
let
down
to
the
northeast
runway
have
been
comparable
to
that
of
a
noisy
factory
and
on
take
off
to
a
noise
of
the
riveting
machine
or
steam
hanger,
that
is
also
found
on
page
33
of
the
record.
mr.
william
a.
blair
no
sir.
there
was
no
defense,
the
county
offered
no
testimony.
mr.
william
a.
blair
no
sir.
mr.
william
a.
blair
no,
the
county
offered
no
testimony
at
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
the
controversy
gets
down
to
one
question
whether
or
not
the
county
is
liable,
as
an
owner
and
operator
of
this
public
airport
for
taking
of
an
easement
over
the
plaintiff's
over
the
petitioner's
property
and
that's
the
sole
question
before
you
whether
or
not,
there
was
a
taking
after
which
the
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
blair
yes
and
well,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
doesn't
say
there
was
or
wasn't
a
taking.
mr.
william
a.
blair
well,
they
placed
upon
in
the
state
supreme
court
i
don't
know
well
how
that
was
--
that's
in
contest.
we
say
there
was
a
taking.
the
supreme
court
says
that
we
should
look
to
the
airlines
for
relief
but
it
doesn't
say
that
there
wasn't
a
taking
sir.
mr.
william
a.
blair
that's
what
they
say.
mr.
william
a.
blair
that's
the
issue.
mr.
william
a.
blair
and
that's
the
only
issue
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
william
a.
blair
that's
exactly
the
question,
your
honor
and
we
so
state
it
in
our
brief
and
that
was
basis
on
which
it
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
whether
or
not,
the
county
was
liable
for
a
taking
under
the
circumstances
that
exist
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
william
a.
blair
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
blair
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
a.
blair
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
blair
i
say
to
that
that
this
first,
the
county
selected
the
location
of
the
airport.
it
had
no
mandate
from
any
person
or
from
the
federal
government
or
from
the
airlines
to
locate
for
it
at
any
particular
spot.
they
selected
the
airport
and
the
airport
location.
they
selected
it
for
one
purpose
for
the
public
use
of
all
other
people
of
allegheny
county.
there
would
be
no
excuse
for
this
airport
except
for
public
use
and
the
county
would
have
no
right
to
build
it
except
for
the
use
of
the
public.
the
consequence
is,
that
there
is
a
corridor
leading
beyond
another
airport
over
our
property
for
the
transportation
of
people
for
hire
by
airlines
operating
under
franchises
from
the
federal
government
and
according
to
the
controllers
of
the
federal
government
whereby,
for
the
benefit
of
the
county,
the
residents
of
the
county
of
allegheny
are
property
subject
to
--
subjected
to
this
servitude.
mr.
william
a.
blair
well,
we
might
sue
the
airlines
but
if
we
did
so,
we
would
be
running
counter
to
the
federal
in
the
stand
to
the
counter
of
the
air
commerce
act
which
say,
these
airlines
are
flying
exactly
where
there
are
required
to
fly.
mr.
william
a.
blair
in
our
view,
the
airlines
are
flying
where
they
are
compelled
to
fly
under
the
regulations
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
mr.
william
a.
blair
no
sir.
i
would
say
here
since
its
public
use,
it's
only
the
county
that's
liable.
mr.
william
a.
blair
no
sir.
mr.
william
a.
blair
that
would
be
liable
under
trespass
problem
and
because
of
the
repeated
trespasses,
we
would
be
given
power
and
the
law
of
pennsylvania
could
go
in
and
restrain
their
operation
over
our
property.
mr.
william
a.
blair
well,
we
could
sue
them
in
damage
if
your
honor
please
but
we
could
never
prove
damages
where
we
haven't
--
we
included
in
our
record
here
a
part
of
the
testimony
taken
that
this
hearing
before
the
board
of
view
showing
the
utter
impossibility
of
locating
or
determining
which
claim
cause
damage
or
how
much.
it's
just
an
impossibility
and
an
illusory
thing.
it
can't
be
done.
mr.
william
a.
blair
well,
if
your
honor
please,
that's
not
over
the
--
the
suggestion
of
our
supreme
court
is
that
we
sue
the
commercial
airlines,
but
there
are
more
planes
in
commercial
airlines
were
scheduled,
planes
that
go
over
our
property.
they're
probably
one
out
of
six
or
eight
--
six
or
seven
airlines
there.
mr.
william
a.
blair
yes.
mr.
william
a.
blair
now,
well
there
can't
be
a
joint
--
joint
tortfeasors
here.
you
couldn't
sue
--
if
we
must
sue
the
airlines,
we
have
to
sue
each
one
individually
that
we
claim
damages.
they're
not
acting
in
joint
concert
with
each
other,
they're
only
serving
a
certain
purpose
for
which
they
are
authorized
--
by
which
they're
authorized
by
this
government.
they
first
must
get
certificates
of
authority
and
convenience
in
order
to
operate
and
then
after
they
do
that,
they
have
to
operate
pursuant
to
the
regulations
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
or
federal
aviation
agency
whatever
it
may
be.
that's
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
they
all
do
so,
if
your
honor
please.
of
course,
the
civil
aeronautics
board
directs
the
flight
of
planes
throughout
the
united
states.
the
control
or
the
complete
control
of
aviation
or
air
commerce
is
with
the
federal
government.
and
that
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
because
united
states
is
not
liable
for
this.
there's
the
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
that
is
exactly
right.
the
united
states,
their
position
here
is
that
they
are
exercising
supervision
and
control
over
air
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
safety
and
for
a
unified
control
and
the
unified
handling
of
planes.
you
can
imagine
what
it
would
be
if
that
weren't
so
that
if
ever
political
subdivision
of
this
--
of
the
country
which
has
a
public
airport
in
control
in
operation
and
in
and
out
of
the
airport,
there
would
soon
big
chaos
in
the
air
commerce.
mr.
william
a.
blair
no
sir.
they
have
been
notified
of
this
case
and
were
well
aware
of
it
that
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
no
sir.
i
would
assume
that
they
were
parties
to
here
our
property
privacy
needed
to
be
parties.
this
is
simply
a
suit
of
rendered
condemnation
suit
against
the
people,
the
county
of
allegheny
which
owns
and
operates
the
airport
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
of
allegheny
county
in
order
to
that
they
have
a
major
airport
which
fits
in
with
the
national
airport.
mr.
william
a.
blair
no
sir.
the
county
is
the
owner.
that
they
lease
a
right,
they
entered
agreements
with
the
airlines,
the
right
to
land
and
take
of
from
the
airport.
mr.
william
a.
blair
no.
but
they
have
since
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
but
since
they
wanted
to
participate
in
the
national
airport
plan
and
they
wanted
an
adequate
transport
--
air
transport
facilities
they
have
to
conform
to
a
certain
regulations
of
the
federal
government
to
ensure
safety.
the
federal
government's
position
here
is
in
connection
with
the
safety
in
flight
of
planes.
mr.
william
a.
blair
they
got
a
subsidy
of
5
or
$6
million
in
order
to
help
to
build
this
plane.
the
government
gave
them
a
subsidy
and
say,
you've
got
to
fly
--
you're
authorized
to
build
the
airport
and
to
have
the
people
and
planes
come
in
there
but
that
as
far
as
we
need
to
go
but
we
do
aid
you
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
they
all
fly
â€“
they
all
follow
a
pattern
of
flight
and
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
well,
if
they
did,
they'd
be
violating
the
air
commerce,
the
board's
instructions.
mr.
william
a.
blair
the
â€“
the
airlines
always
say
that
they
are
privileged,
that
they
are
privileged
to
fly
where
they
are
flying
and
they
are
not
only
privileged
but
they
have
to
fly
here
in
order
to
comply
with
the
regulations.
you
understand
the
nearer
they
get
to
the
airport,
the
lower
they
must
be
as
they
approach
it,
and
the
heavier
the
planes,
the
flatter
the
approach
must
be.
so
and
but
--
and
that
is
for
the
safety
in
operations
so
that's
the
reason
the
government
says
to
the
county
of
allegheny,
(inaudible)
probably
under
that
act.
if
you're
going
to
wreck
this
airport,
you've
got
to
protect
that
approach
zone
two
miles
out
from
the
airport
in
order
(inaudible)
any
hazards
along
that
approach
zone
and
if
you
can't
do
it
by
purchase
of
property,
you
have
a
right
to
condemn
it.
now
to
get
air
easements
whenever
it
may
be.
mr.
william
a.
blair
well
that's
merely
two
miles
at
10,000
feet.
mr.
william
a.
blair
no,
our
place
is
three
piece
of
a
mile
about
32,00
feet
sir.
mr.
william
a.
blair
one
--
there
are
one,
whether
it's
negligent
operation,
there
we
would
have
to
sue
the
person
who
committed
the
negligence
and
that
because
he
would
not
be
performing
his
duties
according
to
the
requirements
of
law.
on
the
other,
he's
doing
something
that
he's
compelled
to
do
for
the
benefit
of
the
country.
and
therefore,
what
that
amounts
to
is
if
it
takes
our
property
as
a
public
taking
of
our
property
for
the
public
use.
mr.
william
a.
blair
that's
right
sir.
mr.
william
a.
blair
well,
in
the
first
place,
if
your
honor
please,
there
can't
be
any
blanket
condemnation
of
air
space
unless
there
is
some
authority
for
it
and
there
were
had
--
there's
no
act
which
permits
the
blanket
condemnation
that's
faced
by
the
federal
government
in
any
â€“
in
any
particular
instance.
mr.
william
a.
blair
that's
right.
mr.
william
a.
blair
whether
the
united
states
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
does
not
have
authority
to
take.
mr.
william
a.
blair
no
sir.
that's
what
i
said
in
the
beginning
that
the
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
all
that
united
states
says
is
if
you
erect
an
airport,
you
must
do
it
in
conformance
with
its
safety
requirements
of
the
federal
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
that's
right.
there
is
no
mandate
from
the
federal
government
for
the
county
of
allegheny
or
any
other
political
subdivision
to
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
and
that's
the
distinction
for
it.
that's
right.
mr.
william
a.
blair
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
blair
and
that's
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
there's
no
mandate
in
the
federal
government
to
do
anything
except
to
fly
in
safe
way
and
that's
for
the
protection
of
the
public
and
for
the
traveling
public
and
the
people
on
the
ground.
mr.
william
a.
blair
no,
i
don't
think
the
united
states
says
that
the
--
and
the
owner
of
the
airport
or
of
any
other
subdivision
of
the
state
has
got
to
take
the
property.
what
they
said
here
was
if
you
need
that
property
in
order
to
get
in,
you
are
--
must
get
it
by
â€“
easement,
taking
an
easement
as
you're
authorized
to
do
the
county
of
allegha
can
do
it
by
car
--
by
purchase
or
condemnation
whichever
way
they
want
but
they
have
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
no
sir.
not
get
the
planes
in
and
out
of
the
airport.
mr.
william
a.
blair
they
have
to
travel
in
certain
levels
and
to
get
out
in
there
under
this
approach
on
two
miles
out.
they
have
start
--
they're
supposed
no
matter
which
direction
they
come
from,
but
they're
directed
to
come
in
on
east,
northeast
runway
on
a
particular
day
because
the
wind
conditions
or
other
reasons,
they
go
out
and
they're
supposed
to
go
out
to
the
end
of
that
two
mile
stretch
and
start
to
correct
their
approach
--
gradual
approach
into
the
airport
and
unfortunately
for
us,
we're
nearer
where
they
have
to
land
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
that's
right.
mr.
william
a.
blair
that
is
correct
your
honor
please.
the
same
as
if
they
had
said
too
when
they
grant
a
franchise
to
the
airlines
to
operate,
they
say
you
may
operate
your
planes
but
we
don't
furnish
you
the
planes
but
you
must
fly
according
to
our
requirements.
mr.
william
a.
blair
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
may
be
but
i
don't
know
of
that.
mr.
william
a.
blair
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
may
be
the
--
that's
unfortunate
that
you
understand
these
people
and
at
the
beginning
lived
in
this
country
atmosphere
out
here
where
they
were
in
a
quiet
surroundings
know
that
they
didn't
want
to
leave
this
place
or
to
give
or
to
surrender
these
properties
to
have
the
airfield
there,
that
didn't
benefit
them.
they
wanted
to
stay
there
but
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
that
could
be.
i
think
i
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
sir?
mr.
william
a.
blair
oh,
well
that's
what
they
say.
but,
i
have
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
well
then
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
well
that's
a
little
different,
if
your
honor
please.
well
in
our
brief,
i
cited
in
a
possible
in
a
very
awkward
way
an
illustration
of
what
involved
here
that
i
suppose
if
they
erected
a
library
or
some
other
building
near
a
superhighway
or
a
regular
highway
and
in
order
to
get
to
and
from
that
highway
to
that
building,
they
had
to
travel
over
land
and
it
build
a
road
on
the
land
for
which
they
haven't
paid.
and
it's
the
same
thing
exactly
as
there
so
you
wouldn't
have
to
sue
the
bus
lines
or
the
airlines
or
the
taxi
drivers
in
order
to
recover
from
them
because
they're
going
--
ng
licensed
operators
and
the
public
too
that
in
order
to
get
damages
from
them
for
the
benefit
of
this
public
building.
mr.
william
a.
blair
well.
mr.
william
a.
blair
well,
that's
what
our
supreme
court
says.
mr.
william
a.
blair
but
that
is
not
what
we
say.
mr.
william
a.
blair
not
in
(voice
overlap)
and
that
the
county
has
the
interest
of
having
the
airlines
serve
the
county.
that
wants
to
be
a
modern
county
with
modern
facilities
so
that
they
can
--
their
people
can
travel
to
and
forth
by
in
the
modern
way
of
travel
and
if
they
want
undertake
it,
there's
a
public
need
that
they
assume
that
there
was
a
public
need
and
they
had
to
take
public
action
which
was
by
acquiring
a
land
and
erecting
the
building
but
they
didn't
take
enough
public
action
by
acquiring
the
easement
necessary
to
get
in
and
out
of
this
airport
and
they
located
the
airport
where
they
thought
it
was
proper
to
be
located
and
they
locate
it
for
one
thing
and
that's
for
the
purpose
of
serving
the
public
of
allegheny
county.
thank
you.
mr.
william
a.
blair
before
i
begin
your
honor,
if
the
court
please,
we
have
a
request
permission
to
file
supplemental
citation
at
your
brief.
these
are
the
three
articles
in
the
law
journals
which
came
out
to
or
which
came
out
since
we
were
last
brief
for
this
file
here
and
the
all
three
passed
upon
the
discuss
the
briggs
versus
allegheny
county
case
and
all
the
--
mr.
william
a.
blair
and
the
all
three
disagree
with
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
this
case.
mr.
william
a.
blair
sir?
mr.
william
a.
blair
well,
that's
possible.
nevertheless,
if
your
honor
please,
i
want
to
correct
just
several
things.
first,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
says
according
to
mr.
louik
at
the
making
of
the
plan,
the
master
plan
which
is
the
basis
of
our
statement
that
there
is
condemnation
of
our
property
or
the
acquisition
of
more
property,
that
is
not
true.
our
case
was
brought
strictly
within
the
rule
in
the
classification
which
you
said
flights
over
private
land
are
not
a
taking
unless
they
are
so
low
and
so
frequent
and
that
is
to
be
direct
and
immediate
interference
with
the
enjoinment
and
use
of
the
land
and
that's
what
happened
here.
not
the
land
over
the
plan
or
that
the
airport
or
the
approach
zones,
only
that
when
that
the
use
of
that
land
is
with
interference
with
us
and
the
actual
damage
and
contrary
to
what
mr.
louik
says
that
this
is
a
learned
narrow
case,
it's
only
there
has
to
be
the
actual
damage
even
under
the
causby
case
before
a
claimant
can
recover
and
that's
what
we
say
happened
here
and
ackerman
versus
the
court
of
seattle
was
a
similar
case
to
ours
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
washington
said
a
liability
was
with
the
port
which
own
the
airport.
