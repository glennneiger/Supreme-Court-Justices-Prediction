mr.
louik,
if
those
four
criteria
mean
that
the
county
for
these
four
reasons
didn't
need
to
acquire
the
easement
of
this
man's
property,
wouldn't
they
equally
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
county
didn't
even
need
to
acquire
the
land
on
which
the
runway
were.
these
are
going
to
be
the
controller.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
my
point
of
view
is
that
--
let's
just
then
confine
it
to
29
and
30.
now
i
suppose
if
that's
true
and
if
that
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
the
county
should've
condemned
this
easement
and
whether
or
not
it
owes
money
to
this
petitioner
for
taking
his
property,
if
29
and
30
are
the
answer
to
that,
why
are
29
and
30
--
why
don't
--
and
then
they
say
well
a
county
didn't
need
to
acquire
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
even
the
actual
land
on
which
the
airport
is
located.
you
don't
seem
to
answer
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
there
must
--
there
must
be
a
limit
so
that
the
federal
government
couldn't
simply
by
legislative
or
administrative
fiat
say
that
the
--
all
the
airspace
of
the
united
states
more
than
10
feet
off
the
ground
is
--
belongs
to
the
federal
government,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
--
(inaudible)
down
eventually
it's
going
to
land.
it's
got
to
get
down
that
low.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
change
in
the
regulations
to
redefine
navigable
airspace
was
a
point
in
your
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
here
defending
the
judgment
and
you're
entitled
to
defend
it
on
any
basis
you
want
to
either
on
the
grounds
upon
which
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
relied
or
any
other
grounds.
justice
potter
stewart
the
change
in
the
regulations
of
defining
navigable
airspace
certainly
would
be
relevant
consideration.
justice
potter
stewart
the
same
it
would
be
true
if
you
got
new
airplanes
that
needed
a
thousand
more
feet
of
landing
strip.
you
have
to
acquire
more
property.
