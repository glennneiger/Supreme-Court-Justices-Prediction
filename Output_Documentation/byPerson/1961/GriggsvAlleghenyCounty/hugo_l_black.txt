has
the
government
appeared
in
this
case
in
any
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
notified
it?
does
the
record
show
who
notified
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
they
have
to
get
consent
of
the
government
to
build
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
operate
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
--
how
many
miles
do
they
have
to
buy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
--
your
place
is
that
far?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
go
a
long
way
towards
furnishing
(inaudible),
haven't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
they
require
the
operator
â€“
is
there
nay
way
to
avoid
this
dilemma
except
not
to
build
an
airport
or
to
pay
your
people,
or
advice
you
to
cooperate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
can
go
straight
up
and
come
straight
down.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
can
go
straight
up
and
come
straight
down.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
limit
it
to
2,500
feet?
why
wouldn't
it
be
out
as
far
as
there
was
any
property
that
could
have
injured
no
one
by
the
flight
of
the
airplane?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
own
--
where
the
constant
passage
of
the
plane
annoying
so
much
that
the
amounts
to
taking
within
the
cause
of
case.
why
do
you
--
why
could
that
be
limited
to
2,500
feet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far
could
you
get
out
of
pittsburgh
and
why
could
you
put
one
outside
the
pittsburgh,
it
would
save
you
taking
all
the
property
within
two
to
three
miles
by
reason
of
the
noise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
is
then
--
why
if
it
is
the
taking
by
somebody,
either
by
the
government,
or
the
county
or
somebody
here,
to
me
it
is
a
taking,
why
would
the
county
(inaudible)
taking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
wasn't
--
do
you
have
to
assume
in
under
the
causby
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
the
dissent
insisted
on
something
like
this,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
was
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
not
also
the
entity
that
which
is
responsible
for
the
rules
that
required
the
low
flying.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
quite
understand
that.
may
i
ask
you
why
under
the
causby
case,
accepting,
this
should
not
be
considered
as
though
the
county
that
built
a
project,
initiation
of
running
of
automobiles
and
trucks,
an
inevitable
result
of
which
would
be
that
they'll
going
to
run
over
this
man's
land
with
those
trucks.
what's
the
difference
under
the
causby
case
with
its
treatment
of
the
--
of
the
right
of
the
man
for
his
easement
and
that
right
of
the
man
to
have
this
land
free
from
running
of
trucks
over
this?
would
the
county
be
liable
under
those
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
it
got
over
the
land.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
any
court
treated
it
just
that
way?
didn't
it
do
so
in
the
causby
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
have
to
assume
do
you
not
if
they're
flying
in
that
space
causes
him
the
same
kind
of
annoyance
that
the
people
in
the
causby
case
was
caused
by
the
flying
of
the
planes
there.
that's
in
the
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
the
argument
such
that
were
rejected,
was
it
not,
in
the
causby
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
a
little
surprised
that
you
have
not
taken
a
little
bit
difference
with
the
opinion
to
this
effect.
maybe
it
would
be
wrong.
airplanes
fly
on
the
authority
of
the
federal
government.
that's
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
heights
have
been
fixed
to
which
they
can
fly.
the
county
had
merely
taken
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
build
an
airport
for
the
purpose
of
the
planes
flying
in
a
legal
method.
under
the
constitution
this
provided
that
we
should
be
just
compensation
but
that
does
not
mean
it
should
be
imposed
on
everybody
even
though
through
acting
perfectly
lawfully
to
the
conduct
of
their
affair.
but
that
it
shall
be
done,
compensation
should
be
born
by
the
government,
whatever
government
that
is,
that
is
basically
responsible
for
the
taking.
that
may
not
be
a
good
argument
but
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
in
this
country,
the
aviation
business
is
peculiarly
a
part
of
the
national
government's
plan
of
operations
today.
it
has
to
be
--
perhaps
nearly
all
of
these
planes
fly
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
allegation
here,
is
there,
that
the
county
as
these
things
have
operated
in
any
manner,
it's
not
perfectly
legal
under
the
law
which
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
that
of
the
united
states
government
in
this
respect.
