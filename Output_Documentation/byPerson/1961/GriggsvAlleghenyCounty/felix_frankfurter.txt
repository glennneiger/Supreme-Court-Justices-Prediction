mr.
blair,
were
any
of
these
matters
contested?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
question
as
to
the
actual
damage
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
your
client?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
did
the
controversy
get
down
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
any
question
that
there
was
a
taking?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
was
there
a
question
of
who
took?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
that
therefore
that
is
not
in
contest
here,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
your
supreme
court
said,
even
if
there
were
--
assuming
there
was
a
taking,
the
county
is
not
liable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
only
issue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we're
not
here
to
--
we're
not
here
reviewing
a
denial
by
your
court
that
property
was
taken.
i
take
it,
the
whole
controversy
here
is
on
the
assumption
even
if
it
was
taking,
the
county
didn't
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
burden
here
is,
to
disprove
the
conclusion
of
the
supreme
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
if
there
was
a
taking,
you're
not
the
county
who
is
responsible.
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
burden
is
to
undermine
the
conclusion
of
the
supreme
court
--
forgive
me,
that
assuming
there
was
a
taking,
the
county
didn't
do
the
taking,
the
county
isn't
liable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
sue
the
airlines?
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
can't
sue
the
county.
i
just
want
to
explore
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
in
your
view,
the
airlines
were
not
tortfeasors,
were
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
could
not
sue
them
under
your
view,
is
that
right?
or
are
you
saying
that
the
county
and
the
airlines
have
joint
tortfeasors,
which
are
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
there
should
be
--
if
they
are
trespasses,
you
could
sue
them
in
damages,
couldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
airlines
come
in
over
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
haven't
got
a
case
against
the
county.
i'm
not
remotely
suggesting
that,
but
as
i
get
the
opinion
of
your
court,
they
indicate
that
you
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
airlines,
whether
do
you
call
it
a
trespass
would
be
because
trespasses
are
taking
at
to
that
extent
of
cutting
down
of
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
suggestion
that
i
thought
you
were
making
is
that
even
assuming
if
the
airlines
are
liable,
the
county
is
also
liable
and
they
both
as
if
were
joined
towards
tortfeasors
but
you
reject
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
why
don't
you
sue
the
united
states
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
you
just
answer
justice
douglas
with
what
they
had
did
to
your
damage
was
under
the
orders
of
the
united
states
and
you
said
the
united
states
can't
give
orders
that
takes
away
your
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
flights,
the
height
to
which
they
went
--
the
bonus,
all
were
in
conformity
with
some
orders
from
washington.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
couldn't
--
and
they
couldn't
deviate
from
that,
could
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
what
they
did
can
fairly
and
accurately
be
called
conduct
under
authorization
of
federal
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
blair,
would
you
even
have
to
explain
to
me
the
difference
between
the
responsibility
of
the
government
when
negligent
conduct
by
the
fellow
in
the
signal
tower
out
here
at
the
airport
and
the
responsibility
of
the
government
in
authorizing
indeed
requiring
flights
under
the
circumstances
you've
narrated
which
makes
those
in
roads
upon
what
you
deem
your
property
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
country
to
make
these
flights
even
lots
of
takings
for
the
benefit
of
the
country
but
uncle
sam
has
to
pay
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
uncle
sam
thinks
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
country
to
make
those
in
roads
to
be
appreciate
or
to
take
--
physically
to
take
if
you
will,
your
property
buying
the
duty
of
compensation
exist.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
of
course
if
we
didn't
say
you
must
condemn
it,
what
the
court
decided
was
that
there
is
an
implied
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
therefore
compensation
has
to
be
paid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
is
it
not
true
here
so
far
as
united
states
is
concerned,
as
the
efficient
creator
of
this
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
blair,
the
mischief
is
not
the
location
of
the
airport
but
what
is
the
use
to
which
it
is
put.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
i
--
i
have
no
information
of
it
other
than
you
give
me.
as
i
understand
it,
that
if
the
use
to
which
it
was
put,
the
precise
use
was
not
only
authorized
but
directed
by
the
government
of
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
there
any
requirement
or
authorization
that
the
united
states
should
compel
a
use
of
an
airport
only
under
such
conditions
that
it
takes
away
a
neighbor's
property?
it
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
civil
aeronautics
board
has
made
safety
regulations
that
would've
not
disadvantaged
you
or
taken
away
any
of
your
property
rights,
could
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand,
now
you're
saying
that
all
that
the
government
did
was
to
say
that
if
you're
going
to
use
an
airport,
you've
got
to
use
it
--
the
only
way
to
use
the
airport
is
under
these
conditions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
that
entails
taking
somebody's
property,
that's
your
concern
and
not
ours.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
differ
this
--
how
do
you
differ
this
kind
of
laws
from
the
laws
that
comes
to
your
private
interest
where
no
road
is
shut
or
road
is
closed
or
the
road
is
open
and
it
means
depreciation
in
property
sometimes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
very
large
percentage?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
the
--
it's
the
commonwealth,
if
your
commonwealth
or
your
county
leases
a
tract
of
land
to
an
approach
to
another
building
would
necessarily
the
lessor
of
the
state,
the
county
be
liable
or
trucks
to
go
over
somebody
else's
property
but
was
merely
the
lessee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
--
what's
the
difficulty
of
your
supreme
court
with
this
case
is
that
all
the
damage
was
done
was
done
not
by
the
county,
but
by
those
they
gave
these
rights
to
fly
over
your
land.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
this
county
is
liable
because
they
gave
the
airlines
opportunity
to
inflict
damage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
has
--
whether
it's
reasonable
not,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
ownership
of
property
of
the
governmental
unit,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
do
you
say
to
mr.
blair's
suggestion
that
your
supreme
court
relegated
the
petitioner
here
or
(inaudible)
be
the
petitioner
to
a
suit
against
the
airlines
but
that
perhaps
his
choice
that
mr.
blair
as
the
court
gives
his
client
that
you,
whom
you
will
sue
and
for
what.
what
do
say
to
that?
that
the
alternative
offer
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
is
no
alternative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
mr.
blair
to
say
that
this
is
unnecessary
flight
pattern
that
you're
going
to
have
any
flight
there
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
fly
that
low
with
reference
to
his
property,
--
with
reference
to
his
property,
the
lowness
of
the
flight
is
inevitable
and
therefore
damaging.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
something
--
i
don't
think
that
answers
the
claim
that
if
they
have
to
be
necessarily
low
of
course
to
interfere
with
the
property
interest
of
land
owners,
you
can't
fly
otherwise
but
if
you
do
fly,
you
have
to
pay
for
the
necessary
damage
for
your
necessary
flight.
you
don't
have
to
fly
at
all.
if
you
fly,
you
can't
do
it
at
the
expense
of
landowners
adjoining.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
gets
down
to
the
colloquial
who
done
it.
