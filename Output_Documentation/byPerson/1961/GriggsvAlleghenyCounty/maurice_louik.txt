mr.
maurice
louik
if
the
court
please.
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
said
in
this
case
was
that
they
determined
only
one
legal
issue.
assuming
that
the
plaintiff's
property
has
been
damaged,
they
determined
that
the
county
was
not
the
efficient
cause
of
that
particular
injury
and
that
determination
was
based
upon
findings
that
were
made
by
the
board
of
viewers.
i'd
like
to
read
this
because
they
are
just
four
short
sentences,
they
appear
on
page
2
of
my
brief
because
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
we
filed
exceptions
to
the
board
of
viewers
award
and
the
matter
came
up
before
the
court
of
common
pleas
and
our
supreme
court.
the
findings
are
number
29,
30,
31
and
32
and
they
read
as
follows.
29,
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
control
exercised
over
any
aircraft
by
the
county
of
allegheny.
30,
all
flights
into
and
out
of
the
greater
pittsburgh
airport
are
regulated
by
the
civil
aeronautics
administration
of
the
united
states
of
america.
31,
no
flights
of
aircraft
had
been
shown
to
be
in
violation
of
any
regulations
of
the
civil
aeronautics
administration.
and
32,
no
flights
were
shown
to
be
lower
than
necessary
for
a
safe
landing
or
a
safe
taking
off.
now,
what
we
--
mr.
maurice
louik
your
honor,
the
reason
the
supreme
court,
our
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
although
there
were
four
findings
here
actually
based
their
conclusion
only
on
29
and
30
is
so
far
as
the
county's
liability.
they
did
not
accept
our
contention
with
respect
to
31
and
32
which
has
to
do
with
immunity
of
lights
as
such
but
--
mr.
maurice
louik
now
well,
that
--
mr.
maurice
louik
the
property
on
which
the
airport
is
located
is
actually
physically
used
by
the
county.
we
have
constructed
buildings
on
that
property.
we
have
constructed
runways
on
that
property.
now,
in
the
drafting
of
our
master
plan
which
is
part
of
the
preparation
for
the
airport,
we
have
taken,
actually
taken,
appropriated
and
paid
for
certain
number
of
acres
of
land
upon
which
we
construct
our
facilities.
we
then
show
an
approach
zone
and
this
must
all
be
approved
by
the
federal
government,
an
approach
zone
that
extends
out
--
that
extends
some
10,000
feet
beyond
the
end
of
the
runway
and
fans
out
from
a
width
of
250
feet
to
--
or
from
500
feet
to
2,500
feet.
and
that
is
the
approach
zone
that
the
airlines
are
required
to
operate
within
the
regulations
of
the
civil
aeronautics
administration.
the
position
of
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was,
and
the
reason
that
was
rejected
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
was
that
the
drafting
of
that
master
plan,
constituted
a
taking
of
the
plaintiff's
property.
now,
if
it
constituted
a
taking
of
the
plaintiff's
property
merely
by
drafting
a
plan
and
showing
an
approach
zone
to
that
extent,
then
the
county
would
really
have
taken
and
i
use
that
in
quotes,
all
of
the
property
extending
10,000
feet
beyond
the
end
of
the
runway
and
of
a
width
going
from
500
to
2,500
feet.
now
we've
had
no
control
over
these
planes.
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
the
reason
i
say
2,500
feet
is
because
that
the
tightest
contention
is
that
we
have
taken
his
property
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
is
in
the
approach
zone
limiting
to
the
allegations
in
this
case.
mr.
maurice
louik
on
the
basis
of
the
plaintiff's
complaint
that
because
he
is
in
the
approach
zone,
and
i'm
saying
if
that
is
true,
then
we
have
taken
everything
in
the
approach
zone
which
extends
up
to
2,500
feet.
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
you
couldn't,
your
honor.
there
would
be
no
place
in
an
area
like
allegheny
county
where
you
could
take
property,
where
you
could
build
an
airport,
where
you
wouldn't
have
planes
coming
in
at
some
altitude
lower
than
500
feet
or
a
thousand
feet
as
the
plaintiff
has
indicated
here
in
order
to
get
into
the
airport.
now
--
mr.
maurice
louik
pardon
me.
mr.
maurice
louik
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
have
a
zoning
--
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
we
have
a
zoning
ordinance
which
of
course
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
but
it
is
a
zoning
ordinance
which
prohibits
certain
heights
of
buildings
and
certain
types
of
structures
with
a
minimum
--
i
believe
that's
25
feet
that
you
can
build
anything
that's
25
feet
above
the
ground.
but,
there
are
limitations
for
future
use
of
any
of
this
property
which
would
interfere
with
the
use
of
the
airport.
mr.
maurice
louik
that
is
correct.
mr.
maurice
louik
now,
the
basis
of
this
case
--
mr.
maurice
louik
as
any
community
was
affecting
use
of
land
by
reason
of
any
zoning
ordinance.
there
is
no
attack
here
on
our
zoning
ordinance
your
honor.
any
type
of
zoning
ordinance
would
of
course
affect
the
future
use
of
any
land
and
the
only
question
that
ever
comes
up
on
zoning
is
whether
if
it's
a
reasonable
ordinance
and
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
maurice
louik
that
is
correct.
now
the
position
of
the
county
in
this
case
is
that
the
acts
of
the
county
do
not
constitute
a
taking
or
any
injury
to
the
plaintiff's
property.
secondly
--
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
assuming
that
it
is
a
taking,
--
mr.
maurice
louik
your
honor,
we
have
to
assume
that
in
this
sense.
the
causby
case
uses
the
word
--
uses
the
term
taking
and
finds
that
the
government
was
liable,
“the
taking”
of
that
property.
the
reason
given
in
the
causby
case
was
that
there
were
continuous
low
flights
of
such
a
type
that
interfered,
substantially
interfered
with
the
use
of
the
plaintiff's
property.
that
is
in
effect
a
tort
but,
the
court
--
mr.
maurice
louik
yes.
mr.
maurice
louik
i
think
in
your
dissent,
your
honor,
you
pointed
out
exactly
the
problem
that
we
have
now.
but
in
that
case,
the
government
was
the
efficient
cause
of
the
damage
or
whatever
it
is,
tort
or
taking
as
this
court
said
taking,
but
it
was
the
efficient
cause
of
the
damage
because
the
government
operated
the
flights.
now,
it
is
not
correct
your
honor
as
it
was
stated
with
respect
to
the
causby
case
that
there
--
that
that
was
a
federal
airport.
in
the
causby
case
--
mr.
maurice
louik
it
was
leased
from
a
municipality.
the
municipality
in
that
case
was
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
allegheny
county
is.
there
were
military
planes,
and
there
were
commercial
planes
as
appears
from
the
record
in
the
causby
case.
in
our
case
too,
there
are
military
planes,
there
are
commercial
planes,
there
are
private
planes,
but
the
entity
that
was
held
liable
in
the
causby
case
was
the
operator
of
the
aircraft
and
in
every
case
in
which
there
has
been
liability
imposed
by
reason
of
flights
of
aircraft
whether
the
term
was
used
taking
or
tort
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
entity
that
was
held
liable
was
the
entity
that
operated
the
aircraft
not
the
entity
that
merely
set
up
the
airport
into
which
and
out
of
which
these
aircrafts
could
fly.
mr.
maurice
louik
in
the
causby
case
also,
the
court
--
this
court
did
not
indicate
the
basis
upon
which
the
decision
was
founded
in
that
whether
the
united
states
was
held
liable
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
promulgated
the
regulations
or
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
operated
the
aircraft,
but
those
two
facts
did
remain
or
do
remain
in
that
case.
the
united
states
government
did
not
own
--
certainly
was
not
held
liable
because
it
owned
and
operated
as
an
airport.
it
was
liable
either
because
it
--
or
made
the
regulations
or
because
it
flew
the
aircraft,
but
as
i
read
the
opinion,
the
basis
of
it
was
that
the
government
was
the
efficient
cause
because
it
operated
the
aircraft
because
you
say
in
your
opinion
that
the
taking
took
place
by
the
reason
of
the
continuous
low
flying
of
these
aircrafts.
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
your
honor
please
and
i
answer
that
in
this
way.
i
do
not
think
that
this
--
that
a
constitutional
question
is
raised
because
of
a
possibility
that
the
remedy
might
be
illusory.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
remedy
is
not
illusory
and
the
remedy
has
been
used
in
other
cases.
there
have
been
cases
against
the
united
states
government
in
tort
for
the
flight
of
aircraft.
there
have
been
cases
--
there
is
the
case
of
the
city
of
newark
where
the
court
--
in
the
district
court
of
new
york
where
the
--
or
new
jersey
where
the
court
went
into
the
question
of
tort
claim.
the
only
thing
that
they
determined
in
that
case
that
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence.
now,
whether
or
not,
that
remedy
is
illusory
will
depend
if
and
when
the
plaintiff
uses
that
remedy.
now
the
plaintiff
has
no
constitutional
right
to
a
particular
remedy
whether
it'd
be
eminent
domain
or
trespass
or
injunction.
he
does
have
as
we
contend
and
as
the
supreme
court
has
said,
he
has
other
available
remedies.
although
our
supreme
court
has
said
is
that
the
county
of
allegheny
is
not
liable
in
eminent
domain
proceedings.
this
is
not
an
act
of
taking
by
the
county.
now,
in
this
very
case,
this
plaintiff
now
has
pending
in
the
pennsylvania
courts
an
action
for
an
injunction
and
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
are
called
the
gardner
cases
are
really
this
case
but
they're
under
another
name
because
there
were
five
different
plaintiffs.
in
the
last
gardner
case,
the
court,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
merely
stayed
an
injunction
proceeding
against
the
airlines
and
against
the
county
to
compel
or
tell
the
plaintiff
to
proceed
in
some
other
manner
to
see
whether
there
would
be
a
remedy.
and
the
supreme
court
at
that
time
stated
that
whether
or
not
the
other
remedy
was
in
trespass
or
in
eminent
domain
for
a
taking
of
an
easement
or
an
eminent
domain
for
a
taking
of
a
fee
would
depend
upon
the
particular
facts
that
he
could
prove.
now,
they
have
tried
--
they
have
taken
one
position.
they
have
attempted
an
eminent
domain
proceeding.
in
that
eminent
domain
proceedings,
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
control
over
these
flights
by
the
county,
that
they
were
not
regulated
by
the
county,
that
they
were
not
flown
by
the
county
and
that
the
master
plan
in
designing
of
an
agreement
with
the
federal
government
did
not
constitute
an
act
to
eminent
domain
under
the
laws
of
pennsylvania.
now,
the
court
did
not
deny
them
due
process
because
they
have
indicated
that
there
are
may
be
other
remedies
that
there
are
other
remedies.
in
fact,
there
is
another
remedy
which
the
court
has
not
even
indicated
in
its
opinion
and
that
is
in
a
remedy
under
the
administrative
agencies
which
was
again
in
the
newark
against
the
eastern
airlines
case,
the
court
said
that
there
were
remedies
provided
for
in
the
federal
aviation
act
for
a
property
who
claims
that
his
property
has
been
damaged
by
reason
of
the
pattern,
flight
pattern
set
up
by
the
federal
government,
set
up
by
these
agencies.
this
is
not
a
matter
for
the
courts
to
determine
what
is
a
proper
flight
pattern
is
and
because
these
are
very
technical
matters
that
the
united
states
has
set
up
an
agency
with
a
provision
in
the
act
where
any
property
owner
who
has
a
complaint
may
go
to
that
agency,
complain
about
the
flight
pattern,
perhaps
have
it
changed
and
that
remedy
is
also
subject
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
this
court.
mr.
maurice
louik
well
--
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
certainly,
at
one
stage
of
the
flight
of
the
flight
is
going
to
be
low.
the
board
of
viewers
in
this
case
made
some
findings
at
our
request
that
these
flights
were
at
indeterminate
altitudes.
now,
even
if
the
flights
were
low,
the
point
is,
your
honor,
that
these
flights
are
controlled
and
determined
by
the
federal
government.
we
have
as
a
county
no
right
whatsoever
to
control
these
flights
to
regulate
--
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
your
honor,
there
are
some
other
very
perplexing
problems
on
this
--
in
this
matter
but
which
are
not
in
this
case
at
this
time
and
that
is
the
whole
problem
of
what
constitutes
navigable
airspace
and
what
the
federal
government
has
done
by
saying
that
there
is
an
absolute
freedom
of
transit
in
the
navigable
airspace
of
the
united
states
and
whether
the
united
states
by
reason
of
the
passage
of
that
act
has
taken
property
or
whether
that
property,
whether
this
was
a
property
right
that
has
never
belonged
to
a
property
owner
has
always
been
on
the
public
domain.
those
are
all
perplexing
problems
that
have
to
do
with
this
whole
question
of
flight
but
i
say
in
this
case,
they
do
not
come
out
at
this
time
because
we
haven't
reached
that
stage
of
the
case.
now,
if
in
when
such
a
case
should
arise
and
perhaps
in
this
case
where
the
question
would
come
up
as
to
whether
the
airlines
are
flying
within
the
public
domain
or
whether
the
united
states
has
created
a
public
domain
out
of
property
which
was
formerly
private
property
or
whether
they
never
was
any
private
property
will
be
in
issue
before
this
court
then
the
proper
case
comes
up
but
that
is
not
the
case
that
we
have
today.
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
the
county
would
not
be
liable
if
we
built
a
road
or
we
build
a
road
and
the
road
was
used
and
caused
damage
to
adjoining
property.
but
--
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
now,
when
it
goes
over
the
land,
the
question
comes
up
as
to
whether
there
is
ownership
in
that
airspace
in
the
plaintiff,
in
the
property
owner
for
which
he
is
entitled
to
any
damage.
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
in
the
causby
case,
they
said
that
there
was
a
taking
by
reason
of
the
flight.
then
the
causby
case
went
further
and
said
that
if
that
agency,
referring
to
the
caa,
have
prescribed
83
feet
as
the
minimum
safe
altitude,
then
we
would
have
presented
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
regulation,
but
nothing
of
the
sort
has
been
done.
basically,
this
court
held
in
the
causby
case
that
the
planes
were
not
flying
within
“the
navigable
airspace”
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
that
is
a
problem
which
will
have
to
be
decided
but
not
in
this
case
as
to
whether
they
are
flying
within
a
navigable
airspace.
now,
we
took
the
position
before
our
supreme
court
--
mr.
maurice
louik
yes,
your
honor
that's
in
the
case
but
our
position
which
was
not
adopted
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
this
case
although
it
was
followed
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
the
gardner
case
was
that
when
these
planes
were
flying
over
the
plaintiff's
property,
they
where
flying
within
the
navigable
airspace.
if
they
were
flying
within
a
navigable
airspace,
they
were
flying
within
airspace
which
did
not
belong
to
the
plaintiff.
it
was
airspace
which
--
mr.
maurice
louik
no.
as
they
pointed
out,
the
causby
case
said
that
there
--
that
it
was
in
that
case
not
within
the
navigable
airspace
but
said
that
if
that
agency
had
prescribed
83
feet
as
the
minimum
safe
altitude,
then
they
would
have
that
question
before
it
as
to
the
validity
of
that
regulation.
there
had
been
changes
in
the
regulations
since
the
causby
case.
there
had
been
changes
in
the
statute
and
now,
we
contend,
we
did
contend
before
our
supreme
court
that
i
again
say
that
that
our
supreme
court
didn't
actually
pass
on
that
in
this
case
but
our
basic
position
was
that
the
planes
were
flying
within
the
navigable
airspace,
therefore,
immune.
we
--
if
--
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
maurice
louik
whether
or
not
the
government
is
liable,
it's
not
a
position
that
i
have
to
take
your
honor.
my
position
is
that
the
counties
are
liable.
when
that
case
comes
up
against
the
federal
government,
there
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
the
united
states
has
taken
something
which
belong
to
the
property
owners
of
this
country
or
whether
it
has
not
taken
anything
but
has
merely
declared
that
a
navigable
airspace
did
--
has
made
the
declaration
that
what
always
did
belong
to
the
united
states,
really
does
belong
to
the
united
states
the
same
as
the
navigable
waters
perhaps,
but
again
this
is
not
a
point
in
our
case
at
this
time.
now
i'd
like
--
from
the
point
of
view
--
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
our
supreme
court
made
at
this
point,
they
said
that
they
were
not
--
that
our
arguments
had
the
rationale
of
reality
but
they
couldn't
accept
it
by
reason
of
the
causby
case
and
then
they
pointed
out
that
there
have
been
changes
since
the
causby
case
but
their
decision
rested
on
this
other
matter
that
the
acts
complied
of,
that
is
the
drafting
of
master
plan,
drawing
of
grant
agreement,
did
not
constitute
and
enacted
them
in
the
domain
by
the
county
but
that
the
plaintiff
had
other
remedies.
mr.
maurice
louik
we
have
so
presented
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
maurice
louik
--
and
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
in
connection
with
that.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
thing
your
honor
if
i
may
before
i
close
and
that
is
with
respect
to
a
municipal
operator
of
the
--
if
this
is
held
to
be
a
taking,
as
a
matter
of
law
by
the
county,
then
you
place
an
intolerable
and
unreasonable
burden
on
every
municipal
airport
operator
because,
it
has
no
control
over
what
it
takes.
we
can
build
an
airport
and
we
can
make
it
comply
with
all
the
regulations
like
we
did
in
this
case,
we
took
1,500
acres.
there
were
at
that
time
certain
regulations
in
effect
by
the
federal
government.
there
were
certain
types
of
planes.
now
let
us
assume
at
the
time
that
we
take,
we
build
this
airport
and
take
all
of
this
land,
the
planes
fly
at
such
an
altitude
that
when
they
get
half
a
mile
or
a
mile
up
or
off
the
runway,
they
are
at
a
height
of
500
or
700
feet.
without
our
consent
and
without
our
knowledge,
a
regulation
could
be
changed
or
a
new
type
of
aircraft
could
be
certificated
and
has
been
done
in
this
case
because
at
the
time
we
started
operations,
there
were
no
jet
aircraft
and
we
suddenly
find
that
by
reason
of
the
federal
government's
action,
these
planes
do
not
reach
a
--
let's
take
it
any
figure
--
500
feet
until
they
get
three
miles
out
off
the
airport.
and
we
find
it
as
the
cabbie
we
have
suddenly
“taken”
perhaps
500
other
pieces
of
property.
now,
that
place
is
--
mr.
maurice
louik
well,
we
would
--
but
then
that
would
be
an
act
of
the
county.
we
would
go
--
we
would
take
that
property
or
if
we
didn't
provide
that
landing
space,
the
planes
could
not
land
there.
but
by
a
change
in
regulation
or
a
change
of
certification
by
the
federal
government,
we
would
automatically
if
this
was
a
taking
find
ourselves
having
taken
property
which
we
had
no
knowledge
that
we
took.
now,
this
would
place
an
intolerable
burden
on
any
municipal
operator
because
we
would
never
know
what
these
airports
would
cost
us.
mr.
maurice
louik
your
honor,
i
will
say
that
we
have
touched
upon
that
in
our
brief.
i
have
not
argued
it
here
because
we
have
tried
to
limit
our
argument
to
the
point
that
as
we
see
the
basic
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
county
is
liable
on
the
basis
of
this
particular
fact
and
not
on
the
general
proposition
--
mr.
maurice
louik
as
i've
read
these
findings,
the
findings
arguably
that
they
operated
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
federal
--
mr.
maurice
louik
and
that
is
right
your
honor.
and
i
--
