mr.
louis
v.
nelson
mr.
chief
--
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
levingston
shipbuilding
company
and
the
insurance
care
--
the
travelers
insurance
company.
as
i
see
it,
the
question
here
is
as
to
whether
the
longshoremen's
act
has
repeal
the
texas
workman's
compensation
act
or
say
they
decide
and
its
all
to
what
extent.
we
have
the
texas
act
passed
in
1913
applicable
to
navigable
injuries.
it
has
been
held
by
the
courts
of
texas
that
the
texas
act
is
applicable
to
navigable
injuries.
it
has
been
held
that
new
construction
on
the
sabine
river,
where
levingston
is
the
employer
on,
i
believe,
the
same
barge,
was
under
the
texas
act
in
gonzalez
against
the
travelers
insurance
company.
now,
we
have
here
a
case
that
unti
--
as
judge
brown
says
until
these
two
cases,
there
was
no
serious
contention
that
new
construction
work
was
covered.
that
has
been
the
belief,
the
advice
and
the
reasoning
of
the
lawyers,
the
employers,
their
attorneys
in
the
courts
ever
since
the
longshoremen's
act
was
passed
and
prior
thereto.
even
the
sabine
river
in
millers'
against
braud
by
this
court,
in
the
middle
of
the
sabine
river,
a
navigable
injury
was
held
not
only
to
be
under
the
texas
act
but
that
the
texas
act
was
exclusive,
the
exclusive
remedy.
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
millers'
indemnity
against
braud,
about
1920.
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
the
united
states
supreme
court
--
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
the
--
the
--
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
270
u.s.
59
is
this
courts'
opinion.
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
and
affirmance
of
the
texas
supreme
court
allowing
recovery.
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
about
that
time.
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
--
that's
correct.
but
they
particularly
granted
the
exclusive
remedy
features
of
the
texas
act
as
against
the
contention
made
in
that
case,
that
the
texas
act
could
not
bar
any
rights
they
may
have
on
a
maritime
or
admiralty
law.
now,
the
courts
and
the
lawyers
assume
or
familiar
with
the
pre-1927
history.
but
it
hasn't
been
pointed
out
yet
in
the
arguments
here
and
i
just
want
to
run
over
the
history
that
we
are
faced
with
at
the
time
congress
passed
this
act.
we
have
jensen,
of
course,
which
held
that
the
--
i
mean
the
state
acts
could
not
apply.
congress
immediately
saved
the
state
compensation
acts
in
the
act
of
1917
to
maritime
workers
and
knickerbocker
set
it
aside.
then
the
act
of
1922,
saved
it
to
the
compensation
under
the
state
acts
to
whom
and
provided
that
it
was
exclusive
remedy
and
washington
against
dawson
struck
that
down.
at
the
same
time
thereafter,
the
grant
smith-porter
case
came
up
and
specifically
held
that
new
ship
construction
was
a
matter
that
could
be
governed
by
state
compensations
laws,
that
state
compensation
laws
were
applicable
and
to
be
precise,
that
the
oregon
state
compensation
law
in
its
provision
that
it
was
the
exclusive
remedy
was
to
be
given
effect.
that's
the
very
words
in
the
grand
smith-poter
case.
and
it
was
that
about
that
time
that
the
millers'
indemnity
against
braud
which
involved
the
texas
workmen's
compensation
act
which
we
have
here
in
the
same
river.
one
of
the
other
cases
that
might
be
understood
and
bring
a
different
light
to
it
is
the
sultan
railway
case
in
which
logging
and
sawing
industry
was
recognized
as
something
the
states
could
provide
although
the
men
were
on
navigable
streams.
the
fact
that
they
were
on
these
logs
and
putting
them
in
booms
did
not
make
the
federal
law
applicable
nor
the
fact
that
other
men
at
the
end
of
the
line
were
taken
them
out
of
the
booms
and
guide
them
up
to
conveyer
to
the
sawmill
and
they
held
that
that
was
not.
now,
that's
before
the
act.
at
the
time
congress
passed
this
longshoremen's
act,
that's
what
they
had.
some
cases
allowing
the
state
acts
to
apply
and
some
cases
allow
--
not
allowing
the
state
acts
to
apply
and
two
attempts
on
their
part
to
allow
the
state
acts
to
apply
in
all
cases
having
been
struck
down,
they
were
forced
to
pass
this
act.
we
need
not
go
to
the
record
back
in
1926
or
1927
because
certainly,
it's
been
examined
many
times
before.
there
is
an
indication
though
in
page
37
of
the
petitioner's
brief
that
shows
the
purpose
of
the
act
does
not
to
include
new
ship
construction
because
it
says
the
purpose
of
this
bill
is
to
provide
for
compensation
instead
of
liability
for
a
class
of
employers
commonly
known
as
“longshoremen”.
these
men
are
mainly
employed
in
loading,
unloading,
refitting
and
repairing
ships.
but
that's
what
congress
was
faced
with
at
that
time.
and
immediately
after
the
passage
of
the
act,
the
bureau
issued
its
own
opinion
number
7
which
i
have
the
--
is
in
the
petitioner's
brief
in
the
appendix
in
which
it
specifically
held
that
new
ship
construction
would
not
be
considered,
that's
the
petitioner's
brief
page
83
and
the
actual
holding
and
based
upon
this
rohde
case
and
the
francis
mcdonald
that
new
--
employers
en
--
engaged
in
new
construction
would
not
be
considered
covered
by
the
act
even
though
they
also
did
ship
repair.
now,
since
that
time
up
to
the
present
time,
we
have
the
--
this
court's
pronouncements
but
not
directly
as
on
new
ship
construction.
the
court
is
familiar,
however,
with
the
provision
placed
in
the
act
by
congress.
it
can
be
read
several
ways
and
i
know
that
in
some
of
the
decisions
it
has
been
quoted
several
ways
but
the
words
do
include
“but
only
if
recovery
may
not
be
had
under
the
state,
validly
had
under
the
state
law.”
as
to
that
provision
is
been
quoted
in
1930
in
cook
and
nogueira,
in
1932
in
crowell
against
benson,
in
1941
in
parker,
1942
in
davis,
1953
in
o'rourke,
and
1959
in
hahn.
i
believe
that
is
all
of
this
court's
decisions
that
have
attempted
to
construe
or
interpret
that
provision.
now,
we
have
the
bureaus
opinion
already
that
is
in
charge
of
enforcing
this
act.
we
have
the
dissenting
opinion
in
cook,
i'm
not
quoting
it
for
its
holding
but
it
is
the
first
pronouncement
i
could
find
that
referred
to
the
section
3
(a),
that
portion
of
it
where
it
says,
"but
only
if
recovery
may
not
validly
be
provided
by
the
--
the
state
act."
and
what
does
cook
says?
cook
uses
the
word
“withheld”.
withheld
covers
and
it
says
this,
"but
the
remedies
given
by
the
act
or
withheld
where
a
recovery
maybe
held
on
the
local
compensation
act.”
nogueira
is
another
case,
it
followed
in
1930
and
referring
to
section
3
(a)
he
says,
"explicitly
made
to
depend
upon
whether
recovery
could
be
held."
the
exact
words
is,
"the
application
of
the
act
in
such
cases
was
explicitly
made
to
depend."
now,
nogueira
might
pose
one
moment
there,
nogueira,
we
mustn't
forget
because
o'rourke
is
nogueira.
there
is
absolutely
no
difference
between
the
two
and
here's
the
1930
case
that
held
the
longshoremen's
act
applicable
to
a
railroad
employee
and
it
was
nothing
that
could
be
done
but
follow
nogueira
and
o'
rourke
case,
as
o'rourke
says,
"there's
no
difference
between
the
employments
in
the
two."
but
the
nogueira
case
is
at
281
u.s.
128
and
a
1930
case.
and
we
have
the
--
those
two
opinions,
crowell
against
ben
--
benson
used
this
word,
"limiting
the
application."
the
opinion
says,
in
limiting
the
application
of
the
act
to
cases
where
we're
covering
through
workmen's
compensation
proceedings
may
not
validly
be
provided
by
a
state
law.
the
congress
evidently
had
in
view
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
the
exclusive
authority
of
the
national
legislature.
now,
where
could
we
get
better
authority
for
the
interpretation
of
the
intention
of
congress
in
this
court's
pronouncements
as
to
its
interpretation,
and
the
footnote
to
that
quotation
cites
jensen,
knickerbocker,
washington
in
that
line
of
cases
for
authority
of
no
coverage
under
the
state
and
grant
smith-porter
and
sultan
railway
in
that
line
of
authorities
for
recovering
under
the
state
workmen's
compensation.
now,
we
come
to
parker-motor
boat
in
1941
and
language
used
in
that
case
with
reference
to
these
three
"a".
congress
have
and
expressly
kept
out
of
the
area
in
which
recovery
may
validly
be
provided
by
a
state
law
or
again,
section
903
(a)
appears
to
be
subscrac
--
subtraction
from
the
scope
of
the
act.
1942
with
davis,
here
again,
however,
congress
made
clear
its
purpose
to
permit
state
compensation
protection
where
an
--
whenever
possible
by
making
the
federal
law
applicable
only
if
recovery
made
not
be
validly
provided
by
state
law.
and
o'rourke,
outside
the
reach
of
state
compensation
law,
the
exact
quote
is
this,
"new
jersey
could
not
have
enacted
statutes
granting
compensation
for
respondent's
injury
on
navigable
waters,
therefore,
respondent
comes
within
the
coverage
of
that
portion
of
section
903
(a)
that
includes
those
outside
the
reach
of
the
state
compensation
law.”
and
finally
to
the
last
decision,
hahn,
1959
and
what
words
did
it
use
does
not
apply.
the
longshoremen's
act
does
not
apply.
the
exact
quote
is,
"by
its
terms,
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
does
not
apply
if
recovery
for
the
disability
or
death
through
workmen's
compensation
proceeding
may
validly
be
provided
by
state
law.”
now,
we
must
completely
eliminate
that
provision
in
section
9
--
903
or
3
(a)
where
in
it
says,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
coverage
is
only
if
recovery
cannot
be
validly
provided
by
a
state
law
and
in
every
--
every
discussion
or
pronouncement
by
this
court
since
the
act
was
passed,
you
need
not
go
any
further
but
each
one
has
recognized
that
there's
some
subtraction,
some
withholding,
some
taken
their
way
or
some
restriction
or
some
limitation
or
some
outside
the
reach
or
that
the
longshoremen's
act
does
not
apply
because
of
this
very
section,
that's
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
each
and
every
case.
the
answer
to
this
problem,
if
they'd
be
a
problem
by
a
problem,
i
mean
other
than
this
one
lawsuit
here,
the
answer
to
this
problem
cannot
be
obtained
by
holding
the
injuries
on
navigable
water
or
compensable
under
the
longshoreme's
act.
that's
an
extension
of
the
jensen
doctrine
but
be
that
as
it
may,
it
will
certainly
be
an
extension
of
other
forms
shall
be.
anytime
the
jurisdictional
line
is
let
down
or
expanded
to
live,
that
doesn't
end
it
because
it
will
be
contended
that
it
goes
a
little
bit
further.
i
might
divert
here
because
it
was
brought
out
in
the
brief
and
here
in
the
presentation
to
this
court,
that
it
is
the
intention
of
congress
to
give
speedy
and
inexpensive
relief
and
that
it
would
be
delayed
any
expense
involved
if
the
court
did
not
look
on
the
act
so
liberally
as
to
let
it
apply
to
anyone
who
wanted
to
come
under
it.
but
now,
this
case
we
have
here
today,
this
travelers
insurance
case,
my
own
client,
we
have
paid
the
claimants
in
this
case
more
than
the
texas
workmen's
compensation
law,
and
why?
because
we're
paying
it
on
an
order
number
3
made
by
the
deputy
commissioner
after
he
twice
said
we
did
not
owe
it.
but
certainly
a
change
was
held
in
one
of
the
district
courts
in
louisiana
and
the
department
came
in
and
said,
"we
are
wrong,
send
it
back"
in
the
third
time
he
awarded
the
compensation.
now,
what
is
the
delay?
we
are
paying
no
relief
because
of
the
fact
that
the
claimant
cannot
replay
--
repay
is
not
sufficient
to
obtain
a
stay
under
the
compensa
--
longshoremen's
compensation
act
so
even
if
--
if
the
claimants
should
lose,
they
will
win
and
if
they
win,
of
course,
they
will
win.
there
is
no
way
to
get
out
for
a
month.
and
as
to
the
expense,
they
are
furnished
competent
counsel
by
the
government.
they
are
well
protected.
if
there's
any
question
that
someone
may
come
under
the
longshoremen's
act,
they
have
no
hesitancy
at
all
to
get
the
protection
that
they
need
by
the
federal
courts
and
by
the
government's
attorneys.
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
this,
that
this
is
a
diversion
but
it
was
pointed
out
that
to
get
so
much
more
money
under
the
longshoremen's
act
than
they
do
under
the
texas
act,
well,
now
that
all
depends.
now,
at
this
time,
i'm
sure
the
longshoremen's
act
provides
more
for
a
week
--
per
week
and
for
a
longer
term.
but
that
can
change
and
it
is
noted
that
the
cases
that
have
come
up
claiming
workmen's
compensation
under
the
longshoremen's
act
have
been
death
cases.
you
don't
see
them
coming
in
and
claiming
back
into
it
because
then
they
run
to
the
texas
juries
or
a
finger
injury
that
involves
their
wrist
and
the
pain
goes
up
into
the
shoulder
and
produces
total
impairment,
because
then
they
go
to
the
texas
juries
to
get
more
but

is
a
matter
of
form,
either
side
can
appeal
and
is
a
trial
mainly
before
12
of
their
workmen

they

sometimes
they
are
of
a
different
trade
than
the
injured
party.

the
variety
of
question
which
we
might
say
result
in
a
finding
of
total
impairment
for
a
minor
injury
whereas
the
deputy
commissioner
who
passes
on
is
familiar
with
these
doctors
that
testify
all
the
time
and
his
finding
is
final
except
as
to
matters
of
law.
and
parker
is
a
death
case,
avondale
is
a
death
case,
and
u.s.
case
versus
taylor
is
a
death
case.
u.s.
case
this
new
construction
and
turned
it
back
and
parker
and
avondale
to
let
it
stand.
but
the
only
position
i
might
take
in
this
matter,
which
i
think
we
must
all
agree,
and
that
is
that
there
must
be
some
line
drawn
somewhere
upon
the
applica
--
application
of
this
longshoremen's
act
and
exclusive
in
the
same
way
with
reference
to
the
texas
or
any
other
state
act.
now,
perhaps,
i'm
diverting
but
sometimes
the
--
the
examples
i
--
i
think
that
some
of
the
opinions
here
pointed
out
show
that
examples
or
the
or
--
or
--
are
helping
clarifying
--
thinking
sometime
unless
we
step
into
a
trap.
now,
if
we
have
--
i
have
answered
the
petition
in
my
brief
and
i
--
i
won't
let
this
time
take
this
--
the
time
to
answer
with
reference
to
this
one
contention
but
if
we
say
that
we
have
navig
--
an
injury
on
navigable
waters
and
it
is
therefore
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act,
where
are
we
going
to
stop?
is
the
clothing
salesman
that
goes
to
galveston,
texas
on
the
ferry
that
crosses
the
houston
ship
--
ship
channel,
is
he
under
the
act?
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
if
the
--
if
u.s.
steel
or
bethlehem
steel
or
somewhere
on
that.
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
well,
they
might
have
something
just
like
--
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
the
point
--
my
point
is
when
is
the
legal
enmity
going
to
stop?
how
about
the
one
that
has
the
repair
shop
and
the
new
shop
at
galveston,
texas
but
in
--
on
the
atlantic
coast
has
only
the
new
construction,
is
the
one
with
only
the
new
construction
--
that
new
construction
not
covered
or
is
the
one
that
has
the
repair
and
the
new
construction
at
galveston,
new
construction
is
coming
or
suppose
that
the
--
it
is
the
same
legal
entity
to
--
that
owns
both
plants
then
there's
new
construction
on
the
atlantic
in
that
plant
covered
even
though
the
one
next
to
is
not
covered,
both
doing
only
new
construction
but
one
owning
a
repair
plant
in
galveston
and
the
other
not
only
a
repair
plant
or
has
in
a
separate
corporation?
is
the
employee
who's
out
fishing
in
a
small
boat
in
the
sabine
river
catching
bus
and
has
a
customer
and
in
the
course
of
his
employment
covered
by
the
longshoremen's
act?
the
position
here
of
the
petitioner,
i
believe
if
i
interpret
it
other
than
the
quotes
from
the
congressional
record,
is
to
--
is
depended
upon
o'rourke.
o'rourke
states
at
the
outset
that
it
was
granted
because
of
the
nogueira
case
that
held
exactly
the
same
thing
that
o'rourke
had
to
finally
hold
and
that
that
the
fact
that
the
employee
was
generally
employed
as
a
railroad
man
was
immaterial
in
determining
the
act
--
the
longshoremen's
act
would
apply
if
at
the
time,
he
was
actually
engage
in
what
would
be
interpreted
maritime
employment
and
at
the
time
he
was
engaged
in
unloading
a
railroad
car
that
was
on
a
barge
on
a
navigable
stream
and
they
considered
the
unloading
of
that
railroad
car
on
the
barge
the
same
as
if
he
was
unloading
a
vessel,
what
is
the
difference?
and
o'rourke
followed
that
exactly
and
quoted
that
the
--
both
services
in
both
cases
were
maritime
service.
now,
o'rourke
said
this,
our
differ
--
if
petitioner's
position
on
o'rourke.
when
o'rourke
discusses
the
fact
that
it
is
important
to
know
whether
the
employer
has
other
employees
or
any
employees
engaged
in
maritime
service,
o'rourke
is
speaking
of
the
application
of
the
exclusive
remedy
provision
of
section
905
where
it
says,
"in
reverse
to
employer
who
is
defined
as
a
person
who
has
any
employees
in
maritime
service."
in
other
words,
the
opinion
first
takes
up
the
question
of
coverage
and
refers
specifically
to
section
903
(a)
and
refers
specifically
to
the
withholding
portion,
if
recovery
may
be
held
under
a
state,
and
then
concludes
that
the
jensen
line
was
the
line
of
demarcation
that
the
state
in
the
o'rourke
case
could
not
have
awarded
compensation
that
therefore
it
was
within
the
longshoremen's
act
because
it
could
not
have
been
provided
by
the
state.
from
that
point
on,
o'rourke
then
discusses
as
to
whether
it
will
be
the
exclusive
remedy
as
against
another
federal
statute
and
then
they
look
to
the
definition
of
employer
in
section
905
and
say
that
in
that
instance,
if
he
has
any
employees,
then
it
will
be
the
exclusive
remedy
and
that's
the
way
i
interpret
o'rourke.
i
might
point
out
this
to
the
court.
it's
quite
a
difference
or
appears
to
me
to
be
quite
a
difference
between
the
application
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
and
the
application
of
the
state
act
from
the
standpoint
of
your
honors.
in
the
first
place,
as
i
read
the
decisions
particularly
davis
in
the
per
curiam
after
that,
davis
merely
came
to
the
conclusion
that
jensen
was
probably
wrong
or
at
least
a
lot
of
people
thought
it
was
right
or
wrong
and
a
lot
of
judges
though
it
was
wrong
and
probably
some
of
them
now
think
it
was
wrong.
and
all
that
davis
said
is,
"we
just
won't
find
any
constitutional
obstacle
to
apply
in
the
state
law
because
otherwise,
we
must,
in
this
case,
hold
that
the
law
of
the
state
for
workmen's
compensation
is
unconstitutional
and
we
must
presume
validity
of
the
state
law."
and
that
is
the
last
word
of
the
holding
of
the
majority
opinion
that
we
find
no
constitutional
obstacle
or
objection
i
believe
it
was.
now
that
the
--
the
position
that
i
take
on
behalf
of
respondents
here
is
that
moore
and
baskin
which
allow
state
coverage
was
merely
a
court
saying
that
they
would
find
no
constitutional
objection
to
the
application
of
the
state
law
and
the
did
not
say
that
they
would
not
apply
the
longshoremen's
law
obviously
because
it
was
repair
of
a
vessel
afloat
on
navigable
waters.
but
the
court
did
hold
in
saying
davis
in
the
per
curiam
decisions
that
we
will
find
no
constitutional
objection.
how
far
that
would
go?
we
do
not
know.
but
that
is
an
entirely
different
holding.
that
is
a
disagreement
with
jensen.
on
the
other
hand,
to
hold
that
new
construction
in
face
of
all
of
the
preexisting
authorities,
pre-1927
and
post-1927,
to
hold
that
that
is
under
the
longshoremen's
act,
is
an
extension
of
the
jensen,
further,
and
a
holding
that
the
state
act
cannot
apply
because
you're
--
the
court
has
the
decision
of
grant
smith-porter
to
exclude
it
in
their
own
interpretation
since
that
time,
the
bureau's
own
interpretation
and
the
words
of
the
statute
itself.
i
have
only
one
other
thing
to
note
to
the
court
and
it's
probably
insignificant
but
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
referred
to
the
second
award
but
we
did
get
two
awards
from
the
deputy
commissioner.
in
this
case,
just
--
i
want
to
bring
that
out
just
to
show
the
court
how
this
thing
has
been
handled
all
along
all
the
years,
two
times.
first,
he
denied
it
completely,
he
filed
a
suit
to
set
aside,
it
was
pointed
that
out
that
perhaps
it
was
not
on
the
texas
side
of
the
river
or
no
one
knew
where
the
line
was
anyway
whether
if
it's
in
the
middle
or
on
the
bank.
so,
it
went
back
remanded
by
the
district
court
and
the
second
time,
the
commissioner
again
denied
recovery
and
referred
to
the
same
thing
that
it
has
never
been
held
that
new
construction
was
under.
and
it
was
only
the
third
time
that
it
was
sent
back
to
him
at
the
request
of
the
attorneys
for
the
bureau
in
a
suit
to
set
aside
in
the
western
district
of
louisiana
that
this
award
came
up
against
the
travelers
and
the
levingston
shipbuilding
which
is
the
--
made
the
basis
of
this
claimant's
suit.
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
well,
other
than
they're
here,
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
--
as
i
understand
the
bureau
represent
--
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
it
is
true.
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
is
february
18,
1959
a
rejection
with
that
quotation
that's
--
that
never
had
been
held
and
july
the
30th,
1959,
that's
about
six
months,
the
same
thing
and
they
--
the
final
order
was
may
13,
1960.
and
the
only
notice
we
have
of
any
change
of
opinion
was,
in
fact,
that
they
came
in
and
we
were
on
the
same
side
that
is
deputy
commissioner
calbeck
and
the
employer
carried
to
sustain
the
award
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
an
original
answer
or
an
amended
answer
to
which
they,
in
effect,
say
that
“we,
travelers
and
levingston,
all
are
incorrect
remanded
for
a
change
in
the
law.”
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
that
was
--
i
don't
know,
that
was
purely
procedure
in
answer
to
a
complaint
filed
in
the
western
--
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
none
that
we
know
of.
that
--
i'll
put
it
this
way,
if
your
honor
please,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
or
nothing
in
the
hearing
or
nothing
in
the
prior
proceedings
to
indicate
any
official
change
an
opinion.
our
ruling
--
mr.
louis
v.
nelson
some
change
occurred
somewhere,
sometime
whereas
the
letter
to
me
from
the
director,
i
--
i
asked
him,
i
see
it's
in
the
brief,
page
85,
i
believe,
he
said
that
he
knew
of
none
since
19
--
before
1959
that
allowed
recovery
but
they
qualified
their
opinion.
and
he
referred
to
this
--
this
opinion
number
7
as
not
exactly
an
administrative
ruling
or
determination
or
opinion.
