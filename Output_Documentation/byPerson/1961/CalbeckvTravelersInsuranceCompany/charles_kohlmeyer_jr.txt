mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are,
of
course,
at
complete
variance
with
the
whole
argument
of
the
government
both
as
to
the
background
judicially
and
legislatively
of
the
harbor
workers'
act,
the
meaning
of
the
twilight
zone
theory
and
finally,
the
question
of
election.
i
should
like,
if
i
might,
to
correct
what
i
think
was
an
inadvertent
error
on
the
part
of
the
solicitor
general
in
referring
to
the
nature
of
the
employment
of
aizen
in
the
avondale
case.
your
honors
will
recognize
that
the
two
cases
were
tried
below
as
separate
cases
and
were
consolidated
for
the
first
time
only
on
the
application
of
--
for
a
writ
in
this
court,
therefore,
i
will
present
only
the
avondale
portion
and
mr.
nelson,
who
handled
the
travelers
case
in
texas,
will
present
that
portion
of
it.
insofar
as
avondale
is
concerned,
this
case
went
before
the
deputy
commissioner
on
an
agreed
statement
of
fact
in
which
it
is
stated
that
during
the
entire
term
of
aizen's
employment
by
avondale,
he
worked
solely
on
new
construction
and
performed
no
work
on
repair
jobs.
secondly,
not
withstanding
that
aizen
worked
solely
on
new
construction
and
performed
no
work
on
repair
jobs,
other
workmen
in
particular
crafts
assigned
to
work
on
repair
of
vessels
on
rare
occasions
performed
work
in
the
new
construction
field.
avondale
is
a
shipyard
which
principally
works
on
new
construction.
new
construction
is
completely
different
from
repair.
new
construction
involves
molds,
lofts,
design,
shore
work,
cutting
of
steel
plate,
prefabrication.
repair
work,
on
the
other
hand,
connotes
an
actual
physical
onboard
work
whether
in
dry
dock
or
whether
floating,
of
course.
but
there
are
two
different
types
of
crafts
generally
that
are
used.
there
is
nothing
peculiar
about
a
separation
of
these
two
types
of
craft.
the
crafts
--
the
new
construction
work
is,
as
i
say,
laid
out
in
advance
and
probably
is
less
skilled
than
is
the
repair
work.
nevertheless,
this
man
was
working
on
new
construction.
and
in
the
face
of
this
statute,
we
find
it
difficult
to
understand
how
the
government
hopes
to
get
around
the
words
that
compensation
is
payable
if
recovery
for
the
disability
or
death
through
state
compensation
proceedings
may
not
validly
be
provided.
this
is
the
point
in
the
case,
the
question
of
how
this
clause
got
into
the
act
is
clearly
shown
in
the
hearings
which
are
cited
by
the
government
but
one
portion
of
which
was
omitted.
it
is
to
be
understood,
of
course,
in
this
connection
that
this
act
was
adopted
with
the
background
of
the
jensen
case
before
the
senate
committee
which
--
in
which
the
act
originated.
they
were
looking
to
get
away
from
jensen
to
adopt
the
theory
of
compensation,
liability
without
fault,
which
at
that
time
was
a
rather
new
theory,
and
they
found
it
in
the
area
of
adopting
this
federal
legislation,
principally
applicable
to
longshoremen,
not
to
harbor
workers.
it
was
aimed
at
the
longshore
area.
as
the
senate
committee
stated
in
its
report,
if
longshoremen
could
avail
themselves
of
the
benefits
of
state
compensation
laws,
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
this
legislation.
but
unfortunately,
they
are
excluded
from
the
laws
by
the
character
of
their
employment.
and
they
are
not
only
excluded
but
the
supreme
court
has
more
that
once
held
that
federal
legislation
cannot
constitutionally
be
enacted
that
will
apply
state
laws
to
this
occupation
citing
jensen,
knickerbocker
ice
and
dawson.
now,
this
isn't
a
constitutional
problem
that
is
before
your
honors
today,
it's
a
question
of
legislative
interpretation
and
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
statute
must,
however,
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
constitutional
law
which
existed
at
the
time
that
it
was
adopted.
and
that
law,
as
we
understand
it
and
very
obviously
as
the
senate
committee
understood
it,
precluded
the
federal
government
from
encroaching
into
the
state
field
just
as
it
precluded
the
state
governments
from
encroaching
into
the
federal
field.
the
admiralty
was
on
one
side,
the
state
law
was
on
the
other
side.
the
federal
legislation
could
take
care
of
the
admiralty.
the
state
could
take
care
of
its
own
on
the
purely
local
matters.
the
local
concern
issue
had
been
settled
by
rohde
which
was
a
pre-1927
case,
1927
being
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
harbor
workers'
act.
and
likewise,
the
nordenholt
case
had
been
decided
which
held
that
an
injury
sustained
on
a
wharf
or
an
extension
of
the
land
over
water,
nevertheless,
was
covered
by
state
law.
now,
this
whole
area
is
an
area
of
great
dynamic
movement
today.
we
don't
know
where
we
stand
on
any
of
these
cases
in
the
twilight
zone
until
there
has
been
a
judicial
appraisal
of
the
particular
facts
as
we
understand
it.
we
don't,
of
course,
go
along
with
the
government's
position
that
twilight
zone
offers
a
complete
remedy
to
any
worker
in
the
amphibious
field
nor
did
the
fifth
circuit
go
along
with
that
theory
when
the
argument
was
pressed
upon
it
below.
i
think
that
mr.
justice
douglas
indicated
in
the
avondale-henderson
case
that
there
was
no
twilight
zone
as
to
a
barge
which
was
on
a
dock
where
a
man
was
injured
there.
and
likewise,
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
harlan
dissented
in
the
ross
island-hahn
case
on
the
theory
that
only
in
doubtful
cases
is
davis
necessary.
that
point,
of
course,
can
be
developed
later
but
at
the
moment,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
only
to
the
interpretation
of
this
clause
2
as
judge
brown
called
it
below
in
the
act,
namely,
that
recovery
through
compensation
proceedings
must
not
be
validly
providable
under
state
law
in
order
for
the
federal
act
to
apply.
it
would've
been
very
easy
with
the
background
that
the
congress
had
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
for
this
whole
theory
to
be
pitched
upon
the
admiralty
jurisdiction,
a
locust
injury
as
distinguished
from
any
type
of
employment
concept.
of
course,
the
congress
knew
of
this
with
the
background
of
the
jensen
case
before
it.
jensen
had
held
unconstitutional,
as
your
honors
recall,
the
application
of
a
new
york
state
comp
law
to
an
employee
engaged
in
stevedoring.
throughout
the
years
following
jackson,
numerous
cases
came
up
to
this
court
including
one
leading
case
from
louisiana,
messel
against
the
foundation
company
in
which
the
louisiana
state
compensation
law
was
held
to
be
--
was
held
not
applicable
on
constitutional
grounds
in
a
situation
where
a
repairman
onboard
ship
injured
while
in
--
on
the
navigable
waters
sought
comp
under
the
state
act.
he
was
refused
compensation
because
the
state
act
would
have
unconstitutionally
encroached
upon
the
federal
field
if
it
would
have
been
applied
in
that
case.
that's
the
background
that
was
applicable
in
the
adoption
of
the
harbor
workers'
act.
now,
insofar
as
the
quotations
from
the
individual
members
of
the
legal
profession
who
appeared
at
the
hearings,
it's
our
submission
that
this
is
a
pretty
weak
guide
to
an
interpretation.
on
the
contrary,
the
senate
report
which
condensed
all
the
arguments
pro
and
con,
clearly
indicates
that
the
senate
did
not
intend
and
thought
that
they
could
not
encroach
upon
the
state
field
and
therefore
had
to
stay
with
the
two
types
of
available
remedies.
first,
the
federal,
insofar
as
what
was
classically
known
as
the
“admiralty
area”
and
secondarily,
the
state,
but
preferring
to
give
the
state
jurisdiction
because
they
provide
that
compensation
maybe
payable
if
recovery
through
workmen's
compensation
proceedings
may
not
validly
be
provided
by
state
law.
and
so
far
as
the
act
itself
is
concerned
to
prove
that
there
is
no
question
or
was
no
question
in
the
mind
of
congress
when
it
adopted
the
law
as
to
the
locust
theory,
section
2,
subsection
3
particularly
excludes
from
the
coverage
any
person
engaged
by
the
master
to
load
or
unload
or
repair
any
small
vessel
of
under
18
tons
and
indeed
in
section
3,
it
is
provided
that
no
compensation
shall
be
payable
in
respect
to
the
disability
of
any
person
engaged
to
load
or
unload
or
repair
any
small
vessel
of
under
18
tons
net.
now,
if
the
congress
felt
--
if
the
senate
felt
that
they
could
constitutionally
have
or
rather
if
they
wished
in
enacting
the
statute
solely
to
base
liability
on
the
jurisdictional
grounds
which
were
covered
by
the
admiralty
law
then
why
would
they
have
excluded
a
person
engaged
to
load
or
unload
or
repair
a
small
vessel
of
under
18
tons
net?
obviously,
they
had
concern
for
the
big
ships.
obviously,
they
did
not
have
concern
for
the
over
water
or
over
land
theory.
the
fact
that
an
injury
occurs
over
water
doesn't
necessarily
make
it
subject
to
compensation
under
the
federal
act.
the
fact
that
it
occurs
on
land
probably
does
but,
of
course,
at
the
time
that
the
act
was
adopted,
no
one
could
have
--
would
have
dreamt
of
the
recent
constitutional
developments
and
that
we
have
seen
take
place
where
an
affect
on
commerce
could
be
the
basis
for
the
reaching
of
jurisdiction
by
the
congress.
based
upon
that
interpretation
and
based
upon
the
rohde
case
which
was
likewise
a
pre-1927
supreme
court
decision,
only
one
other
case,
the
taylor
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
and
apparently
that
the
government
has
been
able
to
find,
has
covered
this
particular
isolated
question
of
new
construction.
these
two
cases
are
the
only
two
and
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
courts
held
that
new
construction
was
not
covered
by
federal
but
was
covered
by
the
state
act.
moreover,
the
government
has
cited
in
its
brief
a
report
from
or
rather
opinion
from
the
compensation
commission
and
it
--
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
on
page
83
in
a
letter
from
the
compensation
commission
on
page
84.
it
is
our
submission
that
these
two
documents
clearly
show
that
the
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
harbor
workers'
act
by
the
deputy
commissioners
and
the
united
states
employees
commission,
are
to
the
effect
that
new
construction
would
not
be
covered.
if
there
are
only
two
reported
cases,
it's
our
deduction
and
i
assume
reason
--
of
reasonably
arrived
that
that
there
have
been
no
attempts
on
the
part
of
any
claimants
or
on
the
part
of
any
deputy
commissioners
to
throw
this
type
of
work
into
the
federal
field
because
if
there
had
been,
i'm
quite
confident
that
there
would
have
been
reported
cases
and
there
would
have
been
appeals.
there
are
none,
however,
that
we
have
able
to
find.
and
we
feel
that
the
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
act,
which
certainly
is
one
of
the
best
guides
to
an
interpreted
--
interpretation,
shows
that
there
is
an
ability
here
on
the
part
of
the
commission
to
refrain
from
reaching
or
rather
not
an
ability
but
a
tendency
to
refrain
from
reaching
out
into
the
other
fields.
and
these
two
cases,
arising
almost
simultaneously
in
the
same
circuit,
are
the
only
two
cases
that
we
know
of
where
there
have
been
attempts
by
the
commissioners
to
take
jurisdiction.
but
the
question
--
the
question
of
interpretation
is
not
a
constitutional
question,
it's
solely
and
only
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
and
when
it
is
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation,
this
section
2
or
clause
2
in
the
1st
section
conditioning
recovery
on
a
state
act
not
applying,
we
think
governs
this
particular
area
that
--
of
the
case.
and
so
far
as
the
parker
and
o'rourke
cases
are
concerned,
o'rourke,
if
the
court
please,
did
not
involve
a
state
compact.
the
state
compacts
of
the
--
of
the
compensation
act
of
new
jersey
could
not
constitutionally
have
been
applied
to
o'rourke,
he
was
either
a
harbor
worker
or
he
was
a
railroad
worker,
one
of
the
two.
and
your
honors
decided
in
o'rourke
that
he
was
a
harbor
worker
and
entitled
to
the
compensation
under
the
federal
act.
there
was
no
conflict
there
between
the
state
and
the
federal
law.
there
was
a
conflict
there
between
two
federal
laws.
as
for
example,
your
honors
have
had
these
cases
involving
jones
act
and
compensation
which
continuously
arise
down
in
our
circuit
anyway.
but
in
the
o'rourke
and
in
the
parker
cases,
it
was
clearly
recognized
that
the
field
in
which
a
state
may
not
validly
provide
for
compensation
must
be
taken
for
the
purposes
of
the
federal
act
as
the
same
field
which
the
jensen
line
of
decision
excluded
from
state
compensation
laws.
the
line
of
demarcation
between
the
state
and
the
federal
jurisdictions
was
set
at
jensen
and
was
continued
through
on
the
bases
of
jensen,
the
whole
way.
even
though
parker,
probably,
was
a
precursor
of
the
twilight
zone
decision,
it's
our
understanding
of
the
twilight
zone
theory
that
there
was
never
an
intention
to
grant
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
two
separated
and
completely
different
bodies
such
as
a
state
and
the
federal
bodies
simply
because
an
amphibious
worker
was
injured
somewhere
near
a
waterfront.
now,
this
raises
the
whole
question
of
the
interpretation
of
davis.
davis,
as
your
honors
will
recall,
was
the
original
twilight
zone
case.
but
in
that
case,
davis
was
a
man
who
was
capable
of
being
called
a
shore
side
or
an
--
a
longshoreman
worker.
davis
was
cutting
down
a
bridge
and
if
he
was
classified
as
a
man
who
was
burning
steel
on
a
bridge,
then
he
would
be
a
shore
worker
and
the
matter
would
be
purely
local.
there
would
be
no
question
of
federal
jurisdiction
entering
into
it.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
was
cutting
the
steel
and
ordered
to
fit
it
on
the
barge
which
would
be
taken
away
and
he
died,
of
course,
when
he
fell
overboard
from
the
barge,
if
that
was
so,
then
he
would
be
classified
as
a
longshoreman.
and
on
that
basis,
the
federal
act
would
--
should
necessarily
apply
on
a
constitutional
basis
because
the
state
act
couldn't.
it
was
a
factual
difference
though,
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
black
found
to
exist,
that
was
hard
to
determine
and
therefore,
created
this
twilight
zone
theory.
it
was
not
a
general
overall
theory
as
i
understand
the
government
contends
for
today,
that
anyone
smelling
of
the
sea
can
get
recovery
under
one
or
the
other
law.
this
just
reads
out
entirely
the
proviso
of
the
law
that
compensation
may
only
be
had
if
recovery
can't
be
given
by
the
state
acts.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
if
the
court
please,
i
do
not
think
so.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
parker,
i
--
i
would
rather
think
that
--
that
today,
parker
would
come
closer
to
being
a
jones
act
case
than
he
--
parker
would
come
to
being
a
compensation
case
under
the
federal
law.
he
was
certainly
employed
as
a
seaman.
he
was
a
look-out
on
a
small
boat
and
under
existing
jurisprudence
arising
principally
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
but
the
texas
tower
case
that
your
honors
decided
a
couple
of
years
ago,
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
jen
faller
case.
all
of
them
held
that
such
a
man
could
go
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
whether
he
was
a
seaman
under
the
jones
act.
i
would
think
that
parker
would
be
classified
properly
as
a
seaman
doing
the
work
that
he
was
doing
but
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
of
course,
he
did
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
it
is
also
true,
i
think,
that
your
honors
did
state
in
the
parker
case
that
the
field
which
it
--
in
which
a
state
may
not
validly
provide
for
compensation
must
be
taken
as
a
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
now,
if
this
be
true
and
if
that
statement
is
the
basis
under
rationale
of
the
proceeding,
i
should
think
that
there
would
be
no
intention
to
completely
have
a
mixup
between
the
two.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
that's
right,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
that
there
was
an
indication
in
parker
that
the
twilight
zone
was
coming
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
--
and
--
in
the
course
of
the
opinion,
the
section
of
the
senate
committee
would
--
report
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
was
reviewed
by
justice
black.
he
stated,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
provide
for
federal
compensation
in
the
area
which
the
specific
decisions
referred
to
placed
beyond
the
reach
of
the
states.
the
proviso
permitting
recovery
only
where
a
compensation
may
not
valid
will
be
provided
by
state
law
cannot
be
read
in
a
manner
that
would
defeat
this
purpose,
an
interpretation
which
would
enlarge
or
contract
the
effect
of
the
proviso
in
accordance
with
whether
this
court
rejected
or
reaffirmed
the
constitutional
basis
of
the
jensen
and
its
companion
cases
cannot
be
accepted.
the
result
of
such
an
interpretation
would
be
to
subject
the
scope
--
would
be
to
subject
the
scope
of
protection
that
congress
wished
to
provide
to
uncertainties
that
congress
wish
to
avoid.
the
theory
was
that
this
accident
was
local
concern
i
think
and
yet
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
the
business.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i'm
inclined
to
believe
that
that
could
have
been,
yes.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
it
was
not
said
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
--
in
those
words,
no.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
that
that
so,
yes.
i
think
that
if
parker
had
sought
recovery
under
the
state
law
and
his
twin
had
sought
recovery
under
the
federal
law
simultaneously,
i
think
you
might
have
had
your
same
situation
of
the
twilight
zone
being
announced
a
couple
of
years
before
it
was.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
so.
but
again
if
the
court
please,
this
is
again
a
situation
where
there
was
a
man
who
had
a
doubtful
employment
because
this
man,
parker,
was
a
janitor.
he
wasn't
an
amphibious
worker
at
all.
he
simply
happened
to
be
a
janitor
in
a
--
a
small
boat
retail
sales
organization
and
went
out
on
a
trip
with
them.
his
janitorial
services
were
obviously
purely
local
and
had
no
smell
of
the
sea.
he's
working
as
a
lookout
onboard
the
small
boat
which
i
think
would've
rather
be
stretching
things
to
call
him
a
seaman,
gave
him
an
area
that
--
that
he
should
have,
i
think,
properly
have
been
classified
as
a
seaside
worker
insofar
as
the
actual
moment
preceding
his
drowning
was
concerned.
but
i
have
no
difficulty
factually
in
saying
that
parker
and
davis
are
identically
the
same
because
they
present
those
very
difficult
factual
situations
that
your
honors
were
anxious
to
avoid
continuous
litigation
on.
that,
however,
is
not
true
in
the
instant
case
because
new
construction
from
1922
on
to
date
has
always
been
classified
as
state
comp
--
as
being
a
state
matter
because
first,
it's
purely
local
and
second,
generally
speaking,
new
construction
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
harbor
workers.
it
--
it
just
--
i
don't
think
the
act
was
ever
intended
to
cover
a
new
construction
work.
if
he
happened
to
fall
overboard,
well,
then
he
was
still
covered
by
the
state
law.
and
your
honors,
so
held,
of
course,
in
the
millers'
indemnity
case
in
connection
with
the
diver
and
several
other
cases
in
the
inferior
courts.
the
idea
that
the
solicitor
general
had
propounded
as
to
his
--
as
to
the
question
of
the
availability
of
the
remedy
on
nordenholt,
basing
on
--
on
nordenholt,
the
theory
that
the
dock
was
to
be
covered
--
the
dockside
worker
was
to
be
covered,
we
think
this
just
can't
be
justified
because
in
nordenholt
case
had
been
decided
although
the
admiralty
--
extension
to
admiralty
jurisdiction
act
had
not
been
adopted
at
this
time.
it
was
clearly
shown
through
the
jurisprudence
that
a
man
standing
onboard
ship
as
--
as
judge
brown
said
in
his
opinion
below,
handling
one
end
of
a
bale
of
cotton
and
a
man
standing
on
a
wharf
handling
the
other
end
of
the
bale
of
cotton
and
they
dropped
it
on
their
feet
together
and
hurt
themselves,
one
man
was
covered
by
one
system,
the
other
man
is
covered
by
the
other
system
of
compensation.
now,
this
might
be
illogical.
it
might
be
anything
your
honors
wished
to
classify
but
the
fact
remains
that
that
is
what
the
law
was.
and
if
this
twilight
zone
extension
covers
the
entire
waterfront
rather
than
this
specific
cases
that
are
difficult
to
determine
from
a
factual
basis,
then
we
will
really
have
chaos
in
this
field
and
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
litigation.
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
concurred
especially
in
avondale-henderson
case
and
said
that
there
could
be
no
twilight
zone
as
to
a
barge
in
a
dock
of
marine
railway
where
an
injury
occurred
on
that
because
it
was
particularly
covered
by
the
federal
act.
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
harlan
both
dissented
in
the
ross
island-hahn
case
holding
that
there
was
no
twilight
zone
except
in
factually
doubtful
cases.
and
if
the
decision
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
if
the
court
please,
i
understand
that
but
again,
hahn
was
difficult
and
--
and
again
these
cases
all
are
in
such
a
difficult
field.
and
with
the
law
being
as
a
dynamic
as
it
is
in
this
field,
it
--
it
makes
it
almost
impossible
for
a
practitioner
to
know
what
to
advise
a
client
and
what
a
client
should
do
and
what
a
--
a
laborer
should
do.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
is
correct,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
that
that
is
exactly
right.
in
these
doubtful
cases,
go
on
and
let's
don't
get
to
a
point
where
we're
going
to
weigh
the
balance
and
do
tenacities.
let's
give
the
man
compensation.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
you
can
have
to
get
away
from
the
doubt,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
how
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
but
louisiana
has
--
has
--
no,
not
at
all.
louisiana
has
held
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case
last
year,
held
directly
that
there
was
no
twilight
zone
as
to
a
stevedore
or
a
longshoreman
working
onboard
ship.
he
had
one
remedy
and
that
was
under
the
federal
act.
now,
this
doesn't
involve
a
twilight
remedy.
this
involves
a
state
remedy
if
he's
working
onshore,
a
federal
remedy
if
he's
working
on
ship.
but
if
you
have
a
man
that's
working
like
davis
was,
cutting
down
a
bridge
and
loading
a
barge,
if
he
--
if
you
have
a
man
like
parker
was,
a
janitor
who
was
out
onboard,
work
--
of
a
small
boat
working
as
a
lookout,
then
you
have
your
doubtful
situation
where
davis
and
parker
should
create
your
twilight
zone
and
let
your
first
come
first
serve
basis
remedy
serve.
this
is,
i
think,
perfectly
proper
and
perfectly
consonant
with
the
--
what
i
believe
your
honors
opinion
was
intended
to
do
insofar
as
that
case
is
concerned.
the
one
question
that
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
in
the
moment
or
two
that
remains
is
this
question
of
the
finality
of
the
election.
this
is
a
question
that
is
not
common
to
both
cases,
it's
only
in
the
avondale
case
and
it's
a
subject
of
the
government's
supplemental
brief.
the
brief
indicates
that
the
point
is
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
that
is
not
correct.
it
was
raised
below
but
it
was
not
met
by
the
court
below
because,
of
course,
they
didn't
get
to
that
point
but
the
last
paragraph
of
judge
brown's
opinion
below
does
treat
of
this
question.
this
man
was
paid
compensation
under
the
state
law
for
two
years
and
three
months
prior
to
the
time
that
he
took
it
and
he
said
that
he
wanted
federal
compensation.
now
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes,
if
the
court
please.
the
louisiana
act
is
self-operative.
we
have
no
commission,
you'd
make
no
reports,
you
simply
go
into
the
court
of
general
--
original
jurisdiction
if
there
is
a
dispute.
if
there
is
no
dispute
after
the
first
week,
the
employer
starts
paying
compensation
and
compensation
is
continued
until
it
runs
out
or
until
there
is
a
complete
recovery
or
whatever
the
matter
is.
now,
insofar
as
the
payments
were
concerned,
it
is
stipulated
in
the
stip
--
agreed
stipulation
of
fact
that
avondale
paydays
end
$35
a
week,
which
is
the
maximum
permissible
under
the
state
law,
by
checks
which
clearly
showed
on
their
face
that
they
represented
compensation
under
the
state
compensation
act.
there
was
no
dispute
about
this.
they
clearly
showed
that.
and
it
is
so
stipulated.
on
that
basis
--
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
might
finish
this
one
statement.
on
that
basis,
this
man
got
his
compensations
for
two
years
and
three
months
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
we're
splitting
our
time.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
on
--
on
this
basis,
if
this
man
comes
in
two
years
and
three
months
late
and
seeks
federal
compensation.
now,
you
say,
"what
difference
does
it
make?"
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference,
of
course,
as
to
what
the
liability
of
the
employer
is
as
to
setting
up
reserves
as
to
whether
or
not
he's
going
to
be
finished
with
the
payment
and
there
has
to
be
a
completion
of
--
of
this
compensation
liability
sooner
or
later.
on
that
basis,
it
is
our
submission
that
an
election
has
been
made,
such
an
election
as
mr.
justice
black
contemplated
was
possible
under
the
davis
case.
and
once
having
made
that
election,
then
just
as
if
there
were
an
election
of
remedies
at
common
law,
he's
barred
from
switching
his
horses.
he
just
does
not
have
another
bite
at
this
cherry.
