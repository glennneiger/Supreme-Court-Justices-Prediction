mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
two
cases
hereon
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
injuries
sustained
by
shipyard
employees
while
working
on
vessels
under
construction
but
which
have
been
launched
and
are
float
on
navigable
waters
are
compensable
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act.
the
facts
on
which
this
question
arises
differ
in
immaterial
respect
for
case
to
case
but
they
are
substantially
identical,
indeed
identical
in
all
material
respect
and
the
travelers
insurance
case,
the
first
case,
will
serve
to
illustrate
both.
the
insured
--
the
levingston
shipbuilding
company
operated
the
shipyard
on
the
sabine
river
which
flows
between
texas
and
louisiana.
it's
engaged
both
in
new
constructions
of
new
vessels
and
in
the
repair
of
vessels
which
are
previously
been
put
into
service.
unquestionably,
many
of
its
employees
are
engaged
in
maritime
employment
and
therefore
undeniably,
levingston
was
an
employer
covered
by
the
longshoremen's
act.
mcguyer,
the
employee
who
was
killed
was
employed
by
levingston
as
a
welder
to
work
indiscriminately
at
repairing
vessels
which
had
been
in
service
or
taken
out
of
service
for
repairs
and
also
at
completing
vessels
which
were
under
construction.
on
the
day
in
question,
he
was
working
on
the
superstructure
of
a
building
rig,
a
vessel
which
had
been
launched
and
was
floating
in
the
navigable
waters
of
the
sabine
river
but
it
had
not
been
completed
and
therefore
had
not
been
put
into
service.
there
was
an
explosion
and
the
cause
of
which
is
immaterial,
mcguyer
suffered
very
severe
injuries
of
which
a
week
later
caused
his
death.
in
seeking
compensation
for
these
injuries
sustained
in
the
course
of
his
employment,
mcguyer's
family
had
to
choose
between
seeking
compensation
under
the
federal
statute
or
under
the
texas
act
which
has
agreed
would've
been
the
applicable
state
statute
even
though
the
injury
happened
to
occur
over
on
the
louisiana
side
of
the
river.
under
the
texas
act,
the
widow
would
receive
$35
a
week
for
360
weeks.
that
would
be
the
maximum,
or
a
total
of
$12,600.
under
the
federal
statute,
the
widow
would
receive
in
her
own
right
something
over
$28
a
week
during
her
widowhood
and
an
additional
$12.15
a
week
for
each
of
two
children
on
account
of
their
minority.
this
would
make
a
total
maximum
compensation
to
mrs.
mcguyer
and
the
children
of
$83,500
or
approximately
six
and
half
times
to
some
payable
under
the
texas
act.
mrs.
mcguyer
in
fact
filed
claims
under
both
the
texas
and
federal
statutes
but
the
texas
claim
was
expressly
made
subject
to
the
claims
under
the
federal
act.
the
deputy
commissioner,
conducting
a
hearing
on
the
claim
under
the
federal
act
at
first
found
that
this
was
not
a
covered
injury.
the
case
was
then
carried
by
the
widow
to
the
district
court
and
while
it
was
pending
there,
the
deputy
commissioner
asked
to
have
it
remanded.
it
was
remanded.
the
deputy
commissioner
then
made
a
new
finding
and
then
awarded
compensation
to
the
widow
and
minor
children.
that
award
was
taken
to
the
district
court
by
the
insurance
company,
the
respondent
here.
the
district
court
ruled
that
they're
--
mcguyer
had
been
engaged
in
covered
employment
and
that
therefore
the
injury
was
compensable
under
the
federal
statute.
the
gist
of
its
opinion
is
at
page
40
of
the
record.
the
court
said
in
a
short
opinion,
“here,
mcguyer's
death
arose
out
of
it
in
the
course
of
his
employment
and
since
levingston
had
other
employees
engaged
in
maritime
employment
and
since
mcguyer's
death
admittedly
occurred
upon
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.”
his
widow
and
children
are
entitled
to
compensation
under
the
act.
so
you're
not
--
the
district
court
made
the
right
to
compensation
turn
on
three
facts
which
we
think
are
decisive.
first,
that
the
levingston
shipbuilding
company,
the
employer,
admittedly
had
the
employees
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
second,
that
the
injury
occurred
in
the
course
of
mcguyer's
work
and
as
a
result
of
his
employment.
and
third,
that
it
occurred
upon
navigable
water
and
we
think
were
those
three
facts
here
the
federal
act
applies.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
seems
to
us
to
be
the
holding
of
the
o'rourke
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is
the
holding
numeric
on
the
dixie
sand
and
gravel
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
sixth
circuit
1958
and
we
think
those
cases
to
assume
i
will
state
my
whole
argument
now
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
it
was.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
it
was
not
a
question
of
whether
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
state
act
could
apply.
of
course,
as
your
honor
will
recall
the
day
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
federal
and
state
acts
are
not
mutually
exclusive
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
all
cases.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
squarely
was
held
in
o'rourke
that
--
although
the
injured
employee
in
that
case
was
in
fact,
i
think,
a
railroad
employee,
still
this
three
elements
were
made
out
and
the
majority
of
the
court
concluded
that
the
longshoremen's
act
could
apply
and
that
went
on
and
said,
“this
impliedly
excluded
the
federal
employer's
liability.”
mr.
archibald
cox
he
was
the
brakeman
employed
on
one
side
of
the
north
river
i
take
it.
and
part
of
his
work
in
the
yard
there
would
be
to
go
up
on
trains
or
the
cars
of
the
trains
and
release
the
breaks
so
that
the
locomotive
could
back
up
and
they
could
then
be
pulled
off
on
the
shore.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
was
the
brakeman
who
went
a
little
bit
at
sea,
yes.
the
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
injury
did
occur
on
navigable
waters,
the
clerks
build
out
on
the
same
three
elements
that
the
district
judge
relied
on
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
the
injury
was
on
navigable
water
and
that
the
injury
arose
out
of
its
employment.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
we
think
those
are
the
decisive
circumstances.
in
the
avondale
shipyards'
case,
the
second
case,
the
employee,
minus
aizen
was
also
employed
to
work
indiscriminately
upon
both
vessels
being
repaired
in
the
avondale
shipyard
and
upon
vessels
under
construction
and
he,
like
mcguyer,
was
working
upon
a
drilling
rig,
a
vessel
which
had
been
launched
and
was
floating
on
navigable
waters
at
the
time
of
the
injury.
aizen
was
injured
while
also
working.
in
his
case,
he
was
not
killed.
he
was
totally
and
permanently
disabled.
and
again,
we
have
a
marked
difference
between
the
compensation
that
he
would
receive
if
he
were
--
permitted
to
the
state
law
and
the
compensation
which
he
may
recover
under
the
federal
act
may
recover
in
our
view.
in
human
terms,
the
difference
is
this,
under
the
louisiana
act,
he
would
receive
$25
for
400
weeks.
this
would
cover
him
until
he
was
35
years
old.
from
the
time
he
was
35
until
his
death,
he
would
have
no
means
of
support.
under
the
federal
act,
the
payments
would
run,
he
being
totally
and
permanently
disabled
for
as
long
as
he
lives.
in
actuarial
terms,
the
payments
might
come
to
10
times
as
much
under
the
federal
statute
as
under
the
state
law.
in
his
case,
the
deputy
commissioner's
initial
award,
awarded
compensation
under
the
federal
statute.
the
company
took
the
case
to
the
district
court,
a
different
district
court,
i
may
say
than
the
levingston
shipbuilding
case
went
to
and
that
district
judge
also
sustained
the
award
that's
upholding
the
coverage
of
the
federal
act.
the
cases
were
argued
on
the
same
day
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
both
were
substantially
decided
in
the
opinion
in
the
first
case.
the
court
held
squarely
that
employees
injured
while
working
on
the
construction
of
a
new
vessel
even
though
it
has
been
launched
and
float
in
navigable
water,
must
obtain
compensation
under
the
state
law
and
may
not
obtain
compensation
under
the
federal
act.
the
opinion,
i
think,
really
stands
on
two
legs.
first,
the
court
drew
a
very
sharp
distinction
between
the
completion
of
a
new
vessel
and
the
repair
of
an
existing
vessel.
now,
of
course,
both
types
of
work
when
the
vessel
is
in
float
are
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction.
but
the
new
construction
the
court
--
the
fifth
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
said,
it's
within
the
category
maritime
but
local
so
that
the
state
law
can
apply
and
therefore
it
said,
“the
federal
act
cannot
apply.”
the
second
leg
of
the
court's
opinion
was
to
go
back
to
the
early
president
in
grant
smith-porter
ship
company
against
rohde,
a
case
decided
before
the
enactment
of
the
longshoremen's
act.
and
to
say
that
since
that
case
held
that
an
employee
engaged
in
new
construction
upon
navigable
waters
on
a
floating
(inaudible),
could
recover
under
a
state
longshoremen's
act,
therefore,
he
could
not
recover
under
the
federal
law.
there
are
two
consequences
of
this
distinction
and
reasoning
that
i'd
like
to
advert
too
very
quickly,
the
first
is
that
it
makes
the
compensation,
to
employee
like
--
employees
like
these,
turn
entirely
on
the
happenstance
of
whether
on
a
particular
day
they
are
on
a
new
home
or
upon
an
old
house
being
repaired
because
they
are
employed
like
many
of
--
these
both
were
employed
like
any
--
many
other
workers
to
work
indiscriminately
on
new
construction
and
repair.
the
second
point
i
would
simply
mention
briefly
at
this
day
is
that
the
drawing
of
this
distinction
led
the
court
below
into
a
dictum
which
i
think
is
revealing
of
its
error
because
it
is
squarely
contrary
to
two
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
in
drawing
this
distinction
between
new
construction
and
repair,
the
court
flatly
stated
that
if
the
men
were
engaged
in
repair
work,
they
must
sue
under
the
state
law
and
could
not
recover
under
the
federal
law
because
this
is
squarely
inconsistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
more
vast
cases.
both
of
which
hold
that
employees
engaged
in
repair
work
may
recover
under
the
state
statute
and
i
think
while
this
is
the
not
--
is
the
other
half
of
the
pair
than
the
case
we
have
here
that
it
is
the
converse
and
shows
the
essential
error
in
the
court
below.
now
the
critical
words
of
the
statute
are
conveniently
found
on
pages
two
and
three
of
our
brief.
at
the
top
of
page
three,
you
will
find
the
definition
of
employer.
the
term
employer
means
an
employer
any
of
whose
employees
are
employed
in
maritime
employment
in
whole
or
in
part
on
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
including
any
dry
dock.
and
this
plainly
encompasses
both
the
respondents
in
these
cases.
then
section
3
(a)
903
of
the
code,
provides
compensation
should
be
payable
under
these
chapter
with
respect
of
disability
or
death
of
an
employee
which
incorporates
by
reference
as
you
see
the
definition
of
employer
and
employee
but
only
if
the
disability
or
death
results
from
an
injury
occurring
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
including
any
dry
dock,
we
admittedly
meet
that
requirement.
and
if
recovery
for
the
disability
or
death
through
workmen's
compensation
proceedings
may
not
validly
be
provided
by
state
law
of
the
critical
question
in
this
case
stated
in
general
terms
is
whether
that
concluding
proviso
or
qualification,
if
recovery
for
disability
or
death
may
not
be
validly
provided
by
state
law,
bars
federal
compensation
here
because
through
the
tolerance
or
sufferance
of
admiralty,
prior
to
1927,
states
had
been
allowed
to
give
state
compensation
under
the
conditions
obtained
in
here.
in
answering
these
question,
there
is
one
premise
which
must
be
borne
in
mind
and
that
is
whatever
may
have
been
the
initial
intention
in
this
respect,
it
is
plainly
clear
today
that
the
statute
does
not
make
state
and
federal
compensation
mutually
exclusive
in
all
cases,
and
that,
i
say,
whatever
may
i
have
been
the
initial
meaning
of
this
language,
has
now
become
a
premise
so
well
established
that
i
think
it
takes
no
argument.
this
is
the
statute
which
has
evolved
in
role
to
meet
real
conditions
and
we
interpret
it
in
the
light
of
present
and
not
simply
going
back
to
earlier
interpretation
as
it
was
a
bare
colloc
--
bare
collocation
of
words.
in
our
view,
the
concluding
portion
does
not
bar
recovery
under
the
federal
statute,
and
as
i
said
before,
we
think
the
federal
statute
applies
where
the
three
significant
factors
that
i
mentioned
in
the
discussion
with
mr.
justice
stewart
are
brought
out.
we
find
support
for
this
view
in
the
legislative
history
and
background
of
the
statute.
we
think
it
is
plainly
sustained
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
indeed
except
for
some
recent
decisions
in
the
fifth
circuit
by
the
uniform
course
of
decisions
for
20
years
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
finally,
we
urge
that
even
if
these
contentions
were
not
enough
alone
to
make
out
petition
in
this
case,
even
then
under
the
twilight
zone
doctrine,
established
by
davis
against
department
of
labor,
the
award
of
compensation
should've
been
sustained.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
at
this
point
before
coming
to
those
three
contentions,
if
i
were
to
recall
for
the
court,
the
background
against
which
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
were
mentioned
and
also,
i
recognized,
the
court
has
been
offered
a
good
many
times.
you
will
recall
and
i
can
do
it
by
referring
to
three
cases.
you
will
recall
first
that
the
jensen
case
laid
down
the
proposition
of
constitutional
law
that
injuries
occurring
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
admiralty
courts
were
not
compensable
under
state
statutes
because
admiralty
law
required
uniformity
and
therefore
the
diverse
rules
of
the
48
states
might
not
be
applied
and
that
distinction
was
subsequently
extended
in
two
cases,
the
knickerbocker
ice
and
dawson
cases
to
hold
that
congress
could
not
permit
the
states
to
apply
their
compensation
statutes
in
this
area.
the
second
case
that
i
would
refer
to
is
this
case
of
grant
smith-porter
ship
company
against
rohde,
which
introduced
the
so-called
doctrine
of
maritime
but
local.
in
grant
smith-porter
ship
company
against
rohde,
an
employee
was
injured
while
engaged
in
new
construction
of
a
ship
which
was
afloat
on
the
navigable
water.
he
had
been
employed
to
engage
only
in
new
construction.
his
employment
contract
contained
references
expressed
or
implied
to
the
state
compensation
act
and
the
state
compensation
act
provided
that
an
employee
who
elected
to
come
under
the
act
should
be
deemed
to
have
waived
his
rights
under
the
substantive
law
of
torts
to
sue
for
personal
injury.
and
the
particular
case
which
ultimately
came
to
this
court
was
a
suit
in
tort
to
recover
for
personal
injuries
but
it
was
held
that
the
employee
was
barred
by
his
acceptance
rights
under
the
state
law
and
that
the
state
compensation
act
could
apply
because
the
court
said,
this
was
maritime
but
local.
many
of
the
commentators
striated
the
rohde
case
as
they
retreat
in
part
from
jensen.
there
were
a
series
of
five
or
six
cases
in
this
court
that
applied
the
doctrine
and
the
various
other
kinds
of
employees.
the
third
case,
i
need
to
mention
only
briefly,
industrial
commission
against
nordenholt
corporation
which
drew
the
line
between
state
and
federal
--
between
--
through
the
permissible
line
of
state
acts
in
such
a
way
between
the
ship
and
the
dock
so
that
even
if
the
dock
reached
out
in
the
navigable
waters,
if
the
injury
occurred
on
the
dock,
the
state
law
might
be
applied.
i
mentioned
this
case
because
it's
one
of
the
things
to
which
the
concluding
words
of
section
903
might
be
taken
to
apply.
so
the
question
here
stated
in
the
length
of
its
background
--
of
the
background
of
the
longshoremen's
act
is
whether
this
concluding
if
clause
--
if
recovery
for
the
disability
or
death
through
workmen's
compensation,
may
not
be
validly
provided
by
state
law
is
to
be
held
to
incorporate
into
the
federal
act
a
limitation
on
the
cover
of
which
excludes
from
the
federal
act
this
pre-1927
category
of
maritime
but
local.
our
first
point
is
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
congress
did
not
have
any
intention
--
affirmative
intention
to
incorporate
in
the
section
903
the
doctrine
of
maritime
but
local.
i
stated
in
terms
but
did
not
have
any
intention
to
incorporate
it
because
i
do
think
that
this
is
a
statute
of
which
must
be
interpreted
as
i
have
said
earlier
in
the
length
of
developments
since
it's
neck
but
if
there
were
clear
evidence
that
congress
laid
stress
on
the
maritime
but
local
doctrine,
naturally,
that
would
give
us
a
pause
in
arguing
that
it
was
not
effective
law
today
but
quite
contraries
the
case.
well,
i
do
not
know
that
one
could
press
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
legislative
history
shows
affirmatively
that
the
doctrine
was
repudiated.
it
certainly
finds
more
in
that
direction
than
it
did
in
any
direction
of
preserving
it
or
attaching
importance
to
it.
the
bill
of
which
ultimately
was
enacted,
originated
in
the
senate
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
original
senate
bill
did
incorporate
the
maritime
but
local
doctrine.
we've
set
forth
the
relevant
excerpt
on
page
32
of
our
brief.
this
actually
apply
to
any
employment
performed
on
a
place
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
except
employment
of
local
concern
and
of
no
direct
relation
to
navigation
and
commerce
which
will
not
apply
to
imply
if
he's
a
master
or
a
member
of
the
crew
of
a
vessel.
in
the
hearings,
those
critical
words
which
are
taken
from
the
rohde
case,
employment
of
local
concern
and
of
no
direction,
no
direct
relation
to
navigation
and
commerce
were
explained
as
coming
from
the
rohde
case
and
were
severely
criticized,
indeed
in
a
written
memorandum
filed
some
time
after
the
conclusion
of
the
hearings
but
before
the
committee
made
its
report,
on
behalf
of
the
insurance
companies,
the
association
of
ship
builders,
there
was
a
precise
criticism
of
this
doctrine,
the
criticism
is
quoted
over
on
page
34
of
our
brief.
it
finds
both
with
the
indefiniteness
of
the
words
that
says
that
there
would
be
enumerable
questions
coming
before
the
court
if
they
were
preserved
and
urges
that
the
statute
be
expanded
so
as
to
cover
all
maritime
employment
under
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
was
from
an
employer
group.
the
american
shipbuilders
inc.
and
new
jersey
dry
dock
association.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
also
wanted
to
include
seamen.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
well
that's
--
they'd
--
there's
no
suggestion
of
an
expressed
repeal
in
any
of
the
hearings
that
i
read.
the
chief
debate,
indeed,
was
throughout
to
the
hearings
of
the
senate
and
in
the
house
and
such
a
few
references
are
on
the
floor
was
over
the
position
of
seamen.
but
i
do
think
that
some
significance
must
be
attached
to
this
change
in
wording
which
the
committee
made
because
if
you
will
look
over
on
page
35,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
will
see
that
the
committee,
when
it
reported
the
bill,
rewrote
the
definition
of
coverage
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
out
any
references
to
the
language
of
the
rohde
case
or
maritime
but
local
and
to
expand
its
coverage
even
though
it
did
not
changed
it
to
include
seamen.
it
then
--
it
read
at
that
stage,
compensation
should
be
payable
under
these
act
in
respect
to
disability
or
death
of
an
employee
but
only
if
the
disability
or
death
results
from
an
injury
occurring
upon
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
including
any
dry
dock
or
occurring
while
such
employee
was
employed
onboard
the
vessel
of
the
united
states
on
the
high
seas
and
if
recovery
for
disability
or
death
through
workmen's
compensation
proceedings,
may
not
validly
be
provided
by
state
law.
that
is
the
law
as
it
stands
today
except
that
there
is
this
phrase
coming
right
after
footnote
10
or
occurring
while
such
employee
was
employed
on
board
the
vessel
of
the
united
states
which
was
of
course
subsequently
believed.
i
may
say
that
although
that
suggest
justice
stewart,
that
seamen
might
have
been
covered
at
that
stage.
if
you
turn
over
to
the
next
page,
you
will
see
that
there
is
even
then
was
an
exception
that
took
most
seamen
out,
so
that
while
the
committee
did
broaden
the
bill,
it
did
not
broaden
it
to
the
full
point
of
including
seamen.
the
best
explanation
of
this
chain
that
i
can
find
is
that
the
committee
did
not
wish
to
incorporate
in
to
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act,
the
maritime
but
local
distinction
of
the
rohde
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
there
are
--
i
think
there
are
two
choices
looking
at
it
as
you
just
did
at
the
time
it
was
enacted.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
of
that
time
--
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
well,
i
think
that
if
we
--
i
think
that
it
must
have
had
served
one
or
two
purposes.
one
is
that
it
was
put
in
primarily
as
a
recital
of
the
reasons
for
enacting
the
statute
as
it
were
to
add
the
saying
there
in
coverage,
in
the
coverage
section
that
we
have
to
act
because
jensen
and
the
other
cases
have
excluded
the
state
jurisdiction.
and
this
interpretation
is
certainly
supported
by
the
view
--
by
the
fact
that
the
committee
report
refers
to
jensen
and
knickerbocker
ice
but
neither
on
the
committee
of
reports
or
anywhere
else
was
there
a
references
to
the
maritime
but
local
doctrine.
indeed,
perhaps
you
gain
some
slight
additional
strength
from
the
fact
that
when
the
senate
bill
was
read
on
the
house
floor,
they
simply
stopped
reading
it
after
occurring
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
nobody
attributed
any
significance
to
this
recital.
now,
if
it
must
be
given
some
substitutive
meanings
as
of
that
time,
i
would
say
that
it
was
intended
to
cover
the
situation
involved
in
the
nordenholt
corporation
case.
to
with
--
to
make
it
clear
that
the
longshoreman
who
was
injured
on
the
dock,
reaching
in
the
navigable
waters,
belong
to
the
state
rather
than
under
the
federal
act
because
if
you
had
left
that
out,
it
would
certainly
have
been
possible
to
argue
that
an
injury
upon
a
fixed
structure,
reaching
out
in
the
navigable
water,
was
an
injury
on
navigable
waters
just
as
much
as
it
appeared
on
the
floating
structure.
those
seem
to
me
taking
this
now
as
you
have
to
interpret
it
as
of
the
--
as
of
1927,
as
to
the
two
most
likely
interpretations
of
the
words.
the
legislative
history
in
the
house
does
not
require
the
same
detailed
exposition.
it's
enough
to
say
simply
this,
in
the
house
the
movement
was
only
for
expanding
comfort.
indeed,
the
original
house
bill
expanded
in
coverage
to
the
point
where
seamen
and
masters
were
included.
it
apparently
was
impossible
in
view
of
the
legislative
situation
than
existing
to
enact
such
a
bill
in
an
effort
to
get
a
bill
properly
enacted.
there
was
a
return
to
the
senate
floor
and
that
was
what
the
bill
became
--
and
that
was
the
bill
that
became
the
law.
now,
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
all
of
the
--
except
for
seamen,
all
the
changes
in
language
were
consistent
with
the
notion
of
expanding
the
federal
coverage
to
the
full
extent
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
that
there
were
certainly
nothing
to
indicate
beyond
the
fact
that
the
rohde
case
was
on
the
books
since
that's
an
indication
but
there's
nothing
beyond
that
bare
fact
to
indicate
that
the
congress
attributed
any
importance
to
the
maritime
but
local
exception.
now
of
course,
coming
at
the
statute
today,
35
years
later,
we
think
that
it
is
not
to
be
interpreted
as
it
might
have
been
in
1927
or
1928,
even
so,
we
would
have
had
a
pretty
good
case
then.
but
the
later
decisions,
the
growth,
the
revolution
of
the
statute,
make
it
all
together
plain
that
the
maritime
but
local
doctrine
is
not
a
limitation
upon
the
coverage
of
the
federal
statute.
the
first
case
that
we
think
establishes
that
proposition
is
parker
against
motor
boat
sales
corporation.
you
will
recall
that
in
that
case,
a
janitor
named
porter
who
was
employed
to
work
on
land
about
the
premises
in
someone
who
was
selling
out
boat
motors
and
small
boats
went
upon
a
single
boat
ride
with
his
superior
to
act.
it
was
said,
as
a
look
out
for
any
possible
obstructions
in
the
james
river.he
fell
overboard
and
was
drowned.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
set
aside
an
award
made
by
the
deputy
commissioner
in
favor
of
the
widow
upon
the
ground
that
the
state
could
award
compensation
under
the
doctrine
that
the
accident
while
maritime
was
a
local
concern
and
this
really,
i
think,
not
the
slightest
precedent
but
that
it
was
on
that
ground
the
maritime
but
local
exception
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
acted.
nevertheless,
this
court
reversed
and
sustained
the
award
of
compensation,
and
while
the
opinion
is
not
explicit
upon
that
point,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
rather
clearly
repudiates
the
whole
maritime
but
local
doctrine
as
a
measure
of
the
coverage
of
the
federal
act.
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
maritime
but
local
test,
on
the
rohde
case
and
others
like
it
were
not
cited,
the
opinion
below,
i
think,
would've
been
very
persuasive
if
these
were
the
tips.
instead,
this
court
held
very
simply
that
the
proviso,
the
concluding
language
that
i've
sought
to
direct
your
attention
to
several
times,
referring
the
cases
where
recovery
might
be
had
by
state
law,
did
not
provide
an
exception,
large
enough
to
cover
the
parker
case.
the
commentators
and
the
lower
courts
have
--
with
rather
complete
uniformity,
interpreted
the
parker
case
as
rejecting
the
maritime
but
local
doctrine.
professor
larson
and
his
book
on
workmen's
compensation
says,
this
decision
by
the
highest
court
appear
to
scrap
the
local
exception
to
maritime
employment
but
the
relation
to
navigation
and
commerce
of
an
unauthorized
print
in
a
tiny
outward
motor
might
seem
to
approach
the
vanishing
point.
the
second
case,
which
if
necessary,
puts
this
proposition
beyond
dispute
is
the
case
of
pennsylvania
railroad
against
o'rourke
to
which
i
referred
earlier
in
answer
to
some
questions
from
mr.
justice
stewart.
you
will
recall
that
it
involved
the
freight
brakemen
in
the
yards
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
at
jury's
decision.
the
argument
and
decision
in
the
second
circuit
had
been
inter
--
had
been
directed
to
the
proposition
that
the
place
where
the
injury
occur
because
it
had
occurred
on
navigable
waters
was
not
decisive
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
inquire
into
the
character
of
the
employment
and
the
opinion
below
went
on
in
the
respondent's
argument
in
defense
of
it
was
that
if
the
employment
was
not
maritime,
the
federal
act
had
no
application.
now,
this
argument
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
argument
that
was
made
in
rohde
and
the
other
old
maritime
but
local
cases.
in
grant
smith-porter
against
rohde
itself,
the
emphasis
was
on
the
character
of
what
the
employee
was
hired
to
do.
now,
the
contract
for
constructing
the
ahala
that
was
the
vessel
he
was
working
on,
the
court
said
was
not
maritime
and
also
the
uncompleted
structure
upon
which
the
accident
occurred
was
lying
in
navigable
waters,
neither
rohde's
general
employment
or
his
activities
at
that
time
had
any
relation
to
navigation
or
commerce.
and
in
that
opinion,
the
court
said
with
reference
to
jensen
and
similar
cases,
in
each
of
them,
the
employment
or
contract
was
navigable
in
the
cha
--
it
was
maritime
in
the
character.
here,
the
parties
contracted
with
reference
to
the
state
statute
and
the
alaska
packers'
case,
another
leading
exposition
of
the
maritime
but
local
doctrine
is
written
even
more
explicitly
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
employee
who
in
that
case
had
been
injured
pushing
a
vessel
in
the
navigable
waters
had
been
hired
to
work
about
a
cannery.
it
was
a
dead
season
and
he
was
a
cannery
worker
the
court
had
said
and
therefore
the
local
compensation
act
could
apply.
the
similarity
between
the
two
arguments,
the
argument
by
the
--
in
the
o'rourke
case
and
the
argument
in
the
maritime
but
local
cases,
had
been
noted
in
the
district
court.
indeed,
it
expressly
referred
to
the
rohde
case
and
indicated
that
in
its
judgment,
rohde
was
an
outlaw
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
and
the
rohde
case
and
others
were
cited
not
unnaturally
in
the
briefs
in
this
court,
in
the
o'rourke
case,
for
the
proposition
that
the
federal
act
would
not
apply.
never
the
--
nevertheless,
this
court
squarely
repudiated
the
test
which
calls
for
one
look
at
the
character
of
the
employment
and
indicated,
we
are
clear
that
the
emphasis
of
the
nature
of
respondent's
duties
here
misses
the
month.
the
statute
applies
by
its
own
terms
when
the
employer
has
any
employees
engaged
in
maritime
service
than
going
on
the
exclusive
coverage
of
section
903.
that's
the
one
we
are
arguing
about,
905,
extends
to
an
employee
of
an
employer
made
liable
by
904
when
he
is
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
on
navigable
water
and
we
have
those
same
three
facts,
an
employee
of
an
employer
covered
by
the
act,
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
on
navigable
waters.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
--
i
think
it
did
in
this
sense
if
you'd
say
directly
and
let
me
state
in
the
sense
in
which
it
applies
without
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
could
not
apply
because
the
exception
took
the
case
out.
then
there
would
have
been
an
altogether
different
question
as
to
whether
the
fact
that
a
state
compensation
law
applied,
prevented
recovery
under
the
fela.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
whole
argument
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
it
did
not
and
i
suppose
because
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
did
say
that
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statement
with
deference
to
the
author
of
opinion
and
the
majority
cannot
be
taken
literally
because
since
the
davis
case,
it
has
not
been
true
that
the
federal
and
state
laws
are
mutually
exclusive.
there
are
certainly
instances
in
which
the
state
may
grant
compensation
where
the
injury
occurs
under
circumstances
where
the
federal
law
might
apply.
the
clearest
illustration
is
the
case
of
the
work
on
the
repair
of
a
vessel
where
it
has
been
squarely
held
even
though
the
vessel
is
afloat
on
navigable
water
as
in
the
baskin
case
out
on
the
west
coast
that
the
state
law
may
apply.
but
so,
justice
douglas
is
not
only
obviously
right
but
i
appreciate
him
calling
into
my
attention,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
statement,
however,
is
too
broad
and
simply
does
not
accord
with
the
precedents
in
this
court.
i
may
point
out
that
these
three
facts
that
i've
sought
defect
towards,
that
i've
sought
to
emphasize
have
been
applied
justice
stewart
as
you
recalled
earlier
in
cases
where
the
clearer
question
was
one
of
the
coverage
of
the
federal
act
and
whether
an
award
on
the
federal
act
should
be
sustained.
thus
in
this
dixie
sand
and
gravel
case
on
the
sixth
circuit
stated
very
categorically
in
an
opinion
on
which
--
from
which
there
was
no
descent
on
this
point
that
given
these
three
facts,
then
the
federal
statute
apply.
and
i
think
that
it's
a
--
this
is
rather
clearly
the
rule
not
only
in
fourth
and
sixth
circuit
but
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
that
the
maritime
with
local
test
does
not
applied.
i
would
add
the
fifth
circuit
where
it's
not
the
present
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
think
it's
--
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
speaking
only
of
this
exact
factual
situation.
mr.
archibald
cox
alright.
yes,
that's
what
i
meant
but
--
as
distinguished
from
the
status
of
the
maritime
but
local
doctrine
in
general.
mr.
archibald
cox
speaking
of
this
category
of
new
construction,
i
think
the
facts
as
to
the
decisions
and
law
are
these.
first,
there
are
no
cases
upholding
federal
coverage
as
applied
to
new
construction.
we
have
to
concede
that.
second,
this
is
not
an
area
in
which
it
is
practicable
to
ascertain
what
the
practice
of
the
deputy
commissioner
has
been.
the
awards
are
not
filed
in
a
way
that
they
are
digested
or
analyzed
and
you
simply
can't
run
it
down.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
that
i
must
acknowledge
that
probabilities
are
that
there
were
not
any
significant
number
of
awards
and
compensation
because
i
suppose
that
they
would
have
been
taken
to
courts
in
view
of
the
decisions
if
there
has
been,
although
i
think
that's
a
little
speculative.
i
think
i
have
to
worsen
it
on
that
point.
so
that
judge
brown's
--
if
limited
sufficiently,
judge
brown's
reasoning
is
correct.i
would
make
these
points
in
reply.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
the
notion
that
an
exact
pre-1927
president
removed
something
from
the
area
of
doubt,
has
been
thoroughly
repudiated.
the
more
baskin
cases,
are
the
best
illustrations
and
indeed
the
difficulties
into
which
judge
brown's
search
for
certainty
in
the
pre-1927
precedents
leads
one,
are
very
well
illustrated
by
his
own
opinion
as
i
indicated
earlier,
he
said
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
rule
is,
i'm
referring
to
page
50
of
the
opinion,
in
the
face
of
some
state
court
decisions
which
we
have
expressly
declined
to
approve
or
follow,
have
we
spoken
in
positive
terms
as
to
ship
repairers.
a
ship
repairer
is
not
in
the
twilight.
he
is
in
the
federal
domain.
the
state
act
may
not
validly
imply
but
this
is
just
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
so
that's
one
thing
that
conventions
made
that
to
say
that
certainty
was
given
by
the
pre-1927
decision
is
not
really
proved
in
a
realistic
sense.
second,
i
can't
help
noting
also
perhaps
it's
not
with
significance
that
the
rohde
case
itself
is
distinguishable
on
these
facts
and
indeed
the
opinion
that
some
of
the
deputy
commissioners
apparently
relied
on
is
also
distinguishable.
the
rohde
case
dealt
with
a
man
who
worked
on
new
construction.
mr.
archibald
cox
wholly.
and
these
are
men
who
work
indiscriminately
back
and
forth
and
it
involve
a
contract
referring
to
the
state
act
that
apparently
lose
no
such
contract
here.
again,
the
only
case
which
followed
rohde
early
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act,
was
a
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
judge
brown
himself
acknowledges
that
that
case
has
not
been
followed
in
the
fourth
circuit,
not
in
the
narrow
sense
in
which
we
were
talking
earlier
but
in
the
sense
of
its
broader
rationale.
again,
the
distinction
between
new
construction
and
repair
has
been
clearly
repudiated
in
the
case
of
dry
docks
and
marine
ways.
now
i
see
no
greater
reason
for
applying
it
to
the
construction
of
ships
than
there
is
for
applying
it
to
the
construction
of
dry
docks
and
marine
ways.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
recess,
i
have
almost
concluded
by
comments
upon
the
proposition
that
the
one
thing
that
was
settled
in
this
area
was
that
one
engaged
in
new
construction
even
upon
navigable
waters
could
recover
under
state
law
and
therefore,
not
under
the
federal
act.
i
gave
a
number
of
illustrations
or
quite
some
reference
that
seem
to
me
to
show
not
only
that
all
around
that
doctrine
had
been
shipped
away
but
that
indeed,
even
the
rohde
case
itself
could
be
sharply
distinguished
from
the
travelers
insurance
case
and
could
be
distinguished
even
from
the
avondale
case
where,
also,
the
worker
had
worked
only
on
new
construction
during
his
tenure
of
employment.
he
had
apparently
been
hired
to
do
either
or
both.
now,
of
course,
the
underlying
point
to
which
i
was
attempting
to
direct
myself
was
that
i
think
in
this
area,
you
can't
take
a
single
decision
and
say
that,
well,
that
settles
the
law
on
this
point.
these
cases
are
all
interrelated.
the
rohde
case
laid
down
a
maritime
but
local
doctrine.
and
surely
a
lawyer
in
the
fifth
circuit
deciding
under
which
act
to
proceed
prior
to
the
decision
in
this
case,
would
have
read
three
opinions
by
judge
hutcheson
saying
that
the
maritime
but
local
doctrine
is
not
law
in
interpreting
the
federal
act.
indeed,
so
that
i
think
each
development
necessarily
affects
the
other
cases
and
one
could,
i
won't
take
the
court's
time,
but
if
you
were
to
take
the
maritime
but
local
decisions
in
this
court
prior
to
1927,
you
will
find
that
there
are
several
of
them
which
can't
possibly
be
reconciled
with
the
later
cases
applying
the
scope
or
defining
the
scope
of
the
longshoremen's
act.
indeed,
it
would
seem
to
me
more
fundamentally
that
the
basic
postulate
of
davis
against
department
of
labor
is
that
we
should
not
interpret
this
act
by
looking
to
see
if
we
can
find
some
particular
precedent
that
seems
to
be
close
enough
to
say
that
the
case
has
been
definitely
assigned
one
way
or
the
other.
we
rely,
of
course,
very
heavily
upon
the
davis
case,
as
i
understood
it
--
understand
it,
it
lays
down
the
proposition
that
when
a
case
falls
in
the
penumbra
about
which
--
about
what
might
otherwise
be
the
exact
demarcation
line
between
state
and
federal
jurisdiction
then
without
engaging
and
breaking
up
all
these
old
precedents,
the
employee
may
proceed
under
either
statute
and
that
compensation
should
be
awarded
under
either
as
he
may
proceed.
that
doctrine
rests
upon
two
in
the
sense
--
three
predicates.
one
is
certainly
that
we
are
dealing
with
remedial
humanitarian
legislation
that
the
aim
above
all
else
is
to
provide
these
men
with
compensation
because
they
have
been
injured
in
the
course
of
their
employment
and
therefore
the
--
the
business,
the
industry
should
compensate
them
as
part
of
the
cause.
a
second
predicate
of
the
twilight
zone
doctrine
is
that
the
expense,
we
should
not
incur
expense,
delay
uncertainty
in
litigation,
that
by
applying
either
the
state
law
or
the
federal
law
liberally
as
the
case
may
be
and
construing
exceptions
narrowly
as
one
done
--
one
does
with
remedial
legislation,
the
award
by
either
authority
in
this
peripheral
area
should
be
sustained.
when
dealing
with
a
state
award,
that
is
justified
by
the
presumption
of
constitutionality.
when
dealing
with
a
federal
award,
there
isn't
the
statute
a
creative
presumption
that
the
federal
law
does
apply
so
that
both
of
those
are
available.
taking
these
forces
together,
it
undoubtedly
does
result
in
some
overlapping.
the
moore
and
baskin
cases
shall
have
the
state
jurisdiction
may
overlap
unto
repair
work
which
had
been
under
federal
law.
the
avondale
marine
ways
case,
the
earlier
avondale
marine
ways
case,
shows
how
the
federal
law
has
overlapped
into
areas
which
might
originally
have
been
regarded
as
that
of
the
state.
now,
the
only
problem
that
is
left
if
one
gives
affect
to
these
guides
to
interpretation
and
to
the
humanitarian
purposes
of
both
sets
of
laws
is
the
electoral
problem.
what
does
one
do
with
the
words
if
compensation
may
not
be
validly
awarded
under
state
law?
i'm
tempted
to
escape
simply
by
saying,
well,
as
justice
frankfurter
did
in
his
opinion
in
the
davis
case,
one
can't
expect
to
complete
logical
nicety.
this
is
a
practical
doctrine
and
therefore
no
further
explanation
is
recalled.
i
think
the
court
is
entitled
to
a
little
better
explanation
than
that.
let
me
try
and
put
it
this
way.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
and
must
be
taken
today
as
i
said
in
the
beginning,
that
the
notion
of
exact
mutual
exclusiveness
does
not
and
can
no
longer
obtain.
i
would
explain
these
words
in
one
of
two
ways.
i
would
say
that
they
are
simply
a
recital,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
of
a
condition
rather
than
an
attempt
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
federal
statute,
that
they
recite
one
of
the
conditions
that
lead
to
its
neck.
the
other
possibility
is
that
they
were
intended
to
take
out
of
the
federal
statute
and
give
to
the
states
jurisdiction
over
injuries
occurring
on
fixed
structures
built
out
into
the
water
like
a
long
jet
or
something
of
that
kind
because
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
longshorebern
--
longshoremen's
act
was
enacted.
that
even
so
this,
literally,
may
be
an
accident
in
navigable
waters
or
unnavigable
waters.
nevertheless,
it
was
not
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
that
was
the
doctrine
at
that
time.
and
it
may
be
that
the
language
was
intended
to
make
it
clear
that
there
was
no
effort
to
subsume
that
under
federal
jurisdiction.
but
i
think
the
dominant
point
and
the
one
which
led
me
to
lay
--
take
some
time
going
through
the
legislative
history
is
that
whatever
maybe
the
explanation
of
this
language,
it
was
--
it
was
not
something
which
--
to
which
congress
gave
prime
importance.
it
was
not
something
that
bulks
as
large
as
the
consideration
of
policy
that
gave
rise
to
the
davis
case
and
which
we
think
should
be
controlling
here.
and
consequently,
the
court
has
extended
the
scope
of
federal
jurisdiction
when
the
injury
involved
the
three
factors
that
i
mentioned
earlier
and
since
this
language
had
no
such
important
purpose,
that
whatever
its
motive
or
explanation
maybe,
it
must
be
subordinated
to
the
policy
that
lies
behind
the
twilight
zone
cases
and
accordingly,
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
we
would
think
--
we
would
think
it
should
be
held
that
the
federal
act
applies
if
a
case
supplying
state
jurisdiction
to
these
facts
should
arise,
we
think
that
the
duty
of
the
state
court
would
be
to
sustain
that
award
also.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
a
case
that
--
where
jurisdiction
might
go
either
way,
just
like
the
case
of
work
at
repairing
a
vessel
that
has
been
put
in
service.
mr.
archibald
cox
which
is
already
been
held
to
go
either
way.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
--
the
plaintiff
hasn't
--
hasn't
pushed
forward
with
it
and
isn't
pressing
so
there's
no
occasion
for
the
state
to
do
anything
with.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
was
some
money
paid
by
avondale
marine
ways
to
aizen.
he
received
checks
which
would
have
been
due
either
under
the
state
act
or
under
the
federal
act.
the
checks
were
simply
marked
on
account
of
compensation
or
some
similar
blind
expression
like
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
oh,
yes,
there
was
been
no
--
there's
been
no
proceeding.
and
indeed,
as
i
recall
the
facts
the
--
wait
a
minute,
i've
been
--
i
said
there's
been
no
proceeding.
i
stated
it
too
broadly.
there's
no
--
at
that
time,
there
was
no
proceeding.
under
the
louisiana
act,
there's
an
obligation
to
go
ahead
and
make
payment
even
though
no
proceeding
has
been
instituted
so
that
aizen,
my
point
was
aizen
could
have
received
this
money
under
either
statute.
he
was
entitled
the
money
under
either
statute
and
he
did
nothing
which
could
constitute
an
election.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
amounts
are
larger
under
the
federal
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes,
yes
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
--
that
was
--
i
thought
that
was
what
i
was
saying
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
meant
to
say.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
that's
the
way
he
proceeded.
but
i
suppose
that
if
he
had
chosen
to
proceed
under
texas
law
and
had
not
filed
under
the
federal
act,
that
the
texas
body
would
have
taken
jurisdiction
and
that
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
courts
to
sustain
that
award.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
hope
i've
made
it
clear
because
i
--
i
do
take
it.
he
could
have
gone
either
way.
the
only
problem,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
left
open
and
we
don't
have
to
face
it
here,
is
that
what
point
has
an
employee,
if
any,
has
an
employee
irretrievably
pursued
one
remedy
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
but
there's
no
problem
with
that
kind
here
and
no
occasion
to
pass
judgement
upon
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
take
just
a
minute
to
then
--
effort
to
clarify
a
few
points.
there
is
some
little
light,
mr.
justice
stewart,
some
dim
light
on
this
in
a
letter
beginning
at
page
84
of
the
government's
brief
from
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
employees'
compensation
and
the
united
states
department
of
labor.
i'm
relying
very
largely
on
it
and
what
additional
advice
i've
been
able
to
get
here
from
my
assistants
the
last
few
minutes.
apparently,
the
deputy
commissioners,
up
until
about
1959,
did
feel
that
they
were
bound
by
that
1930
or
thereabouts
opinion.
then
when
this
travelers
insurance
case
was
taken
to
the
district
court
on
appeal
by
the
--
the
state
of
the
dissident,
the
department
of
labor
became
in
charge
for
defending
the
deputy
commission.
and
as
i
understand
it,
its
lawyers
felt
that
in
view
of
parker
and
o'rourke,
they
had
no
defense.
and
it
was
at
that
stage
that
it
was
requested
that
the
matter
be
remanded.
i
have
no
--
i
take
it
that
the
deputy
commissioner
in
the
colloquial
word
got
the
word
one
way
or
another.
i
doubt
from
what
i'm
able
to
learn
that
he
was
directed
to
change
his
opinion
that
apparently,
the
events
were
enough
to
persuade
him.
after
1959
or
thereabouts,
in
the
light
of
this
court's
opinions
and
most
particularly
the
o'rourke
opinion,
the
department
of
labor,
and
i
believe
it
shouldered
down
to
the
deputy
commissioners,
began
to
change
their
view.
a
second
point
which
i
should
mention
is
that
in
my
opening
argument
with
respect
to
the
payments
under
the
louisiana
compensation
act,
i
went
inadvertently
way
beyond
the
record.
i
misunderstood
a
passage
in
our
replied
brief.
it
was
not
accurate
for
me
to
say
that
the
payments
were
simply
indicated
as
payments
of
compensation
or
the
stipulation
clearly
sets
forth
that
they
showed
there
were
payments
under
the
louisiana
statute.
we
do
point
out
that
they
were,
in
fact,
were
more
than
would
be
due
under
the
louisiana
statute.
and
i
had
that
fact
in
mind
that
was
misled
by
but
the
stipulation
is
perfectly
plain,
of
course,
i
don't
attempt
to
go
back
on
it.
two
other
points
that
i
would
like
to
make
clear,
although,
perhaps,
they
are
of
the
essence.
but
first,
let
me
make
it
plain,
especially
in
view
of
mr.
kohlmeyer's
argument,
that
there
was
never
any
doubt
about
power
of
the
congress
to
enact
the
compensation
act
or
any
other
legislation
reaching
in
to
this
maritime
but
local
area.
mr.
archibald
cox
state
law
it's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
still
could
be
subject
to
--
and
i
think
perhaps
i
assumed
that,
without
making
it
clear
enough
to
begin
with,
the
state
law
in
this
maritime
but
local
area
came
in
either
to
supplement
or
indeed
there's
some
thinking
that
it
came
in
and
was
adopted
by
the
admiralty
and
applied
as
if
it
were
admiralty
law
but
i
don't
need
to
go
that
far,
the
point
is
the
defense
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
everything
except
could
not.
it
was
that
the
admiralty
court
wouldn't
done
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
there's
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
but
the
congress
do
act
in
this
area.
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear.
let's
step
aside
from
the
compensation
field
for
a
minute.
take
the
matter
of
wrongful
--
wrongful
death
and
they
sue
the
common
law
where
under
the
garcia
and
others
that
laid
the
foundation
through
this,
state
wrongful
death
statutes
were
allowed
to
supplement
the
admiralty.
i
take
it
that
if
congress
were
to
pass
a
uniform
law
applicable
in
the
admiralty
for
that
area,
then
no
one
would
dispute
the
power
of
congress
to
act.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
the
rohde
case
is
simply
an
application
of
wester
fuel
against
garcia
and
lack
points.
now,
the
reason
i
emphasize
this,
if
i
may
take
just
one
additional
moment
--
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice.
is
that,
of
course,
this
concluding
--
the
--
the
references
to
jensen
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
this
court's
opinions,
say
in
parker,
the
references
to
jensen
do
not
necessarily
carry
with
them
references
to
rohde
and
the
maritime
but
local
rule.
there's
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
must
have
gone
hand
in
hand
in
the
minds
of
the
authors
of
those
opinions
or
the
authors
of
the
senate
committee
report.
indeed,
most
of
the
commentators
had
treated
them
as
quite
separate
and
the
maritime
but
local
is
being
a
retreat
from
jensen.
so
that
seems
to
me
that
one
could
take
the
words
but
not
if
recovery
may
be
validly
provided
by
state
law
as
incorporating
jensen
without
the
rubric
of
rohde
and
other
cases
on
it
rather
than
as
incorporing
--
incorporating
it
with
that
revert.
now,
my
final
point
is
that
the
real
issue
here
is
whether,
although
we
think
we
would
have
a
good
case
even
in
terms
of
the
original
statute,
is
whether
this
case
is
to
be
decided
as
if
it
were
1927
or
in
the
light
of
the
growth
and
evolution
of
this
statute
in
the
intervening
35
years.
and
that's
epitomized
by
essential
difference
between
mr.
kohlmeyer's
argument
and
my
own.
mr.
kohlmeyer
said
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
congress
to
impeach
this
upon
a
locust
--
locust
theory
rather
than
upon
type
of
employment
and
went
on
to
argue
in
terms
of
type
of
employment.
and
counsel
for
travelers
put
us
issues
of
clothing
salesmen
and
people
out
on
a
single
boat
ride,
again,
referring
to
type
of
employment.
that
question
was
plainly
decided
first
by
nogueira
and
then
by
o'rourke.
and
the
court's
words,
they
are
precisely
applicable
here.
we've
clear
that
the
emphasis
on
the
nature
of
respondents'
duties
misses
the
mark.
the
statute
applies
by
its
own
terms
to
accidents
on
navigable
waters
when
the
employer
has
any
employees
engaged
in
maritime
service.
and
we
think
just
as
it
epitomizes
the
difference
so
that
language
in
the
o'rourke
case
which
had
been
followed
in
the
circuit
courts
including
the
opinion
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
i
mentioned
is
dispositive
of
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
i
would
put
--
i
would
say
that
one
could
resort
to
state
law
on
these
facts.
i
do
not
contend
that
these
men
would
have
been
barred
from
proceeding
under
state
law.
i
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
i
should
--
i
don't
think
i
have
to
argue
this
clearly
federal
and
--
and
i
don't.
i
say
that
the
effect
really,
i
think
what
might,
to
bring
my
argument
into
one
single
point.
i
would
say
that
the
policies
that
lie
behind
the
twilight
zone
because
it
isn't
just
a
slogan,
it
represents
some
important
policies
in
the
growth
of
this
statute
in
the
award
of
compensation
and
i
say
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
and
those
policies
are
enough
to
carry
one
at
least
out
to
the
line
laid
down
by
o'rourke
which
corresponds
with
the
exact
words
of
the
statute
except
for
this
somewhat
doubtful
phrase
that
we've
been
arguing
about
and
as
to
that
i
say
can
be
given
meaning
in
terms
of
jensen
alone
without
incorporating
the
doctrine
of
maritime
but
local.
