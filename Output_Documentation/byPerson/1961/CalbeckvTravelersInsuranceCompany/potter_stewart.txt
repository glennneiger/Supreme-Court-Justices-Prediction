that
was
--
that
was
pretty
much
the
holding
of
o'rourke
case,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
an
opinion
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
sixth
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
the
o'rourke
case,
if
i
have
it
in
mind,
that
was
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
reed,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
involved
a
sort
of
conflict
between
this
federal
statute
and
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
justice
potter
stewart
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
we
know
that.
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
a
member
of
our
train
crew
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
his
injury
did
occur
on
navigable
water.
justice
potter
stewart
his
employer
did
have
employees
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
this
cert
--
occasionally
was
from
an
employer's
group
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
they
wanted
to
include
the
seamen
as
well
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
then
what
to
--
to
repeal
the
jones
act?
is
that
the
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
do
you
think
and
maybe
you've
told
us
but
if
it's
so
i've
missed
it,
what
do
you
think
this
phrase
meant
to
the
congress
at
the
time
it
was
enacted?
justice
potter
stewart
in
--
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
light
against
the
background
of
the
decided
cases
of
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
--
jensen,
knickerbocker
ice
and
dawson
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
o'rourke
case
did
not
involve
directly,
certainly,
the
exemption
--
the
exception
that
we're
talking
about
today
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
this
mr.
solicitor
general
just
for
my
own
information,
did
the
court
in
the
o'rourke
case
discuss
the
proviso
that
the
act
--
the
federal
compensation
act
is
applicable
if
the
state
law
may
not
apply?
justice
potter
stewart
now
mr.
solicitor
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
general.
excuse
me
again
if
i
may
interrupt.
judge
brown
in
his
powerful
style,
indicates
in
this
case
that
the
rule
has
been
pretty
definite
at
least
in
his
circuit
and
i
should
gather
from
what
he
says
that
he
--
that
the
rule
as
being
quite
definite
and
certain
throughout
the
federal
courts
that
in
this
specific
factual
context
regardless
of
what
the
general
rules
might
be,
i.e.
--
i.e.
new
construction
even
though
the
--
even
though
the
ship
being
built
is
far
out
for
long
so
it's
floating
on
navigable
water
that
new
construction
is
outside
the
coverage
of
the
federal
act.
that's
what
he
seems
to
apply
and
he
seems
to
--
opinion
seems
to
be
positive
on
the
wisdom
of
having
the
certainty
in
this
area.
justice
potter
stewart
is
he
right
factually
about
that
or
is
he
wrong
factually
about
that
(voice
overlap)
present?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
category
of
new
construction.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
wholly.
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
think
that
the
parker-motor
boat
case
just
about
accomplish
that
job
of
reading
--
reading
out
that
proviso
of
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
but
for
well
that
--
that
may
be,
that's
an
interesting
idea
but
that
case
did
not
involve
that
question
--
of
whether
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
seaman
is
involved
whether
or
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
covered
by
the
--
this
federal
compensation
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
how
--
how
did
--
how
did
the
parker
opinion
deal
with
this
proviso
of
the
statute?
you
just
said
it
shouldn't
be
read
to
prevent
recovery
here
or
something
like
that,
didn't
it?i
have
to
have
--
in
front
of
me,
i
have
read
it
through.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
would
have
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
have
been
within
the
constitutional
power
of
a
state
to
provide
compensation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
we
--
we
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
but
--
but
the
court
did
say
the
--
this
proviso
of
the
statute
could
not
be
interpreted
to
defeat
recovery
under
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
federal
act
whatever
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
say
that
--
that
opinion
seems
to
foreshadow
the
twilight
zone?
justice
potter
stewart
twilight
could
be
foreshadowed.
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
dissent
--
the
dissent
doesn't
hold
anything.
the
dissents
are
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
what
case
is
that?
what
decision
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
united
states
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
confirm
--
affirmed
by
this
court,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
270
u.s.
59
affirmed
here?
justice
potter
stewart
affirmance.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
1924?
justice
potter
stewart
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
federal
act?
justice
potter
stewart
you
got
a
jury
in
texas
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
workmen's
compensation?
justice
potter
stewart
really?
justice
potter
stewart
with
a
special
kind
of
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
there
a
--
is
there
a
limitation
on
the
awards
or
--
or
is
the
--
is
there
no
--
no
ceiling
on
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
usually
the
question
for
the
jury
is
whether
or
not
it's
permanent
disability
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
partial.
justice
potter
stewart
but
his
employer
wouldn't
be
a
government
employer,
would
he?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
appointed
to?
justice
potter
stewart
have
any
in
some
of
these
days.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
evidence
of
--
exterior
to
the
record
in
this
case
in
the
story
that
you've
just
told
us,
is
there
any
evidence
of
administrative
change
of
mind
in
this
whole
area?
justice
potter
stewart
because
of?
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
two
times
the
deputy
commissioner
disallowed
the
recovery
and
based
to
that
on
the
statement
that
the
compensation
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
fact
have
never
been
--
never
been
held
to
apply
to
new
construction,
did
that
twice
and
then
at
the
request
of
the
--
the
counsel
for
the
deputy
commissioner
was
remanded
to
him
the
third
time
and
he
didn't
arrive
about
face,
is
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
was
early,
what
did
they
rely
on
in
thinking
that
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
they
didn't
refer
to
any
administrative
or
any
change
in
the
administrative
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
obviously
--
obviously
a
change
did
occur.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i've
just
--
i
haven't
--
before
me
now
because
within
the
last
few
minutes,
i
read
the
court's
opinion
in
millers'
indemnity,
this
court's
opinion
in
which
the
opinion
stated
that
this
would
be
a
matter
in
which
admiralty
would
have
jurisdiction
except
that
it
was
maritime
and
local
and
the
state
had
acted
with
its
compensation
act
and
therefore,
maritime
