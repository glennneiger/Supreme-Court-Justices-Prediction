well,
there
were
no
--
yes
the
texas
law
would
apply
in
the
travelers
insurance
case.
unknown
speaker
but
there
were
no
payments
made
with
the
travelers
insurance
case.
there
were
proceedings
filed
in
each
court
but
--
in
each
--
before
reaching
administrative
body.
but
the
texas
one
has
not
been
pressed
because
he
simply
filed
it
to
make
sure
that
he
wouldn't
be
bothered
by
the
statute
limitation
and
also
filed
it
in
such
ways
to
make
the
claim
that
if
there
were
any
necessity
of
an
election,
he
wasn't
electing
under
the
texas
act.
we
cited,
i
may
say,
in
our
reply
brief
sub-cases
dealing
expressly
with
this
problem
of
the
payment.
they
seemed
to
us
to
show,
i
suppose
the
respondent
wouldn't
be
as
persuaded,
that
there
has
been
no
election
here
and
that
accepting
the
payments
does
not
under
the
settled
authorities,
bar
isn't
from
proceeding
before
the
deputy
commissioner
and
under
the
federal
act.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
construe
basically,
its
on
appeal
whether
the
court
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
you
do?
