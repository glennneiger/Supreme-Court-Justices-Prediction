who's

justice
william

just

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
that's
because
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
inquiry
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
within
the
area
of
the
first
amendment,
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
terris,
could
you
tell
me
how
much
of
a
disclosure
to
the
witness
of
these
cases
that's
been
made.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
to
get
back
in
answer
to
my
question.
my
question
was
how
much
of
the
disclosure
has
to
be
made?
i
don't
need
to
ask
which
you
told
me
you
and
mr.
rauh
disagreed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
with
that.
but
how
much
in
disclosure
do
you
think
that's
to
be
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
trial
for
contempt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
suggest
that
they
have
no
--
the
committee
has
no
responsibility
(inaudible)
disclosure
to
the
witness
at
the
appearance
before
the
committee
on
the
basis
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
--
i
thought
he
argued
very
forcefully
yesterday.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
exactly
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
want
to
get
your
position
clear.
your
position
is
that
they
must
have
a
basis
before
they
can
ask
a
question,
a
reasonable
basis
i
think
you
said
but
that
this
disclosure
of
what
that
basis
is,
does
not
have
to
made
to
the
hearing
before
the
committee
but
it
is
only
part
of
the
government's
burden
in
an
ultimate
prosecutions
for
attempt,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
you
can
phrase
it
your
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
am
trying
to
get
clear
is
where
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
say
that
the
government
has
an
obligation
at
some
point
to
make
a
disclosure
of
what
the
basis
was,
without
--
at
what
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
part
of
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
proof
of
what
element
of
the
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
mr.
terris,
you've
already
told
us
that
this
is
part
of
the
government's
plea
to
be
filed.
may
i
ask
first
before
i
ask
the
question
i
was
just
about
to
ask,
suppose
that
the
--
before
the
hearing
that
the
witness
you
say
did
not,
but
supposed
he
had
and,
well,
what
is
the
basis
upon
which
you're
asking
this
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
there
is
no
responsibility
even
if
directly
asked
upon
the
committee
to
tell
them
what
the
basis
is
upon
which
they're
asking
the
question,
"are
you
a
communist?"
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
at
all,
i
see.
so
if
--
if
he
had
asked
a
question
directly
in
just
those
words,
the
committee
would
have
had
no
obligation
to
answer
them
but
he
would
nevertheless
have
had
to
answer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
accept
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you
don't
test
that
if
i
understand
you
on
your
view,
by
anything
that
happens
at
the
hearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
to
be
tested
only
by
what
happened
at
that
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
i
understand.
now,
may
i
get
to
the
second
question,
i
think
you've
made
that
very
clear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
--
now
let's
get
then
to
the
trial
where
you
do
say
that
the
government
include
--
must
include
something
which
indicates
that
they
had
a
reasonable
basis.
now,
what
is
that
is
that
just
at
some
member
of
the
committee
or
counsels,
the
problems
to
the
trial
and
says,
"we
had
a
basis
period."
is
that
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know.
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
how
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
form
would
it
take?
the
committee
witness
takes
the
stand
and
said
well
in
our
files,
we
have
information
that
this
witness
attended
meetings
and
such
and
such
and
such
and
such.
well,
we
have
information
as
they
said
here,
a
letter
signed
and
a
pseudonym
in
which
his
name
is
included
among
another
--
a
lot
of
other
names.
well
how
far
may
the
defense
go
to
test
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
if
--
if
the
witness
takes
(inaudible)
that
there
was
a
letter,
the
defense
is
foreclosed
in
trying
to
prove
that
there
wasn't
any
letter.
and
the
only
way
they
could
prove
it,
namely
by
showing
the
files
don't
contain.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
not
a
jenks
problem
anyway,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
that
it
requires
statement
to
this
witness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
letter
which
he
says
that
comply
as
the
reasonable
basis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
get
back
to
this
momentarily?
i
gather
what
you're
telling
is,
if
it's
in
the
first
amendment
area,
they
can't
call
a
man
off
the
street
unless
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
asking
the
question
which
trespass
if
you
please
in
the
first
amendment,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
take
whatever
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anyway,
is
that
--
get
in
to
the
first
amendment,
yet
when
they
get
him
there,
they
can
say
to
him,
"are
you
a
communist?"
they
don't
have
to
tell
them
because
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
asking
it
though,
only
if
before
the
committee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
maybe
he
had
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
--
i
gather
the
--
the
committee
--
the
congress
has
to
vote
before
these
matters
are
submitted
for
contempt
prosecutions,
does
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--
in
the
situation
you
put,
a
cong
--
a
committee
might
have
no
reasonable
basis
yet
call
him
in
and
ask
him,
"are
you
a
communist?"
with
whatever
consequences
that
might
have
and
then
not
pressed
for
a
prosecution
or
you
choose
a
thing
that
might
happen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
getting
at
if
that's
what
occurred
then
they'll
never
be
disclosed
if
they
did
have
some
reasonable
basis
in
believing
that
he
was
before
they
ask
him
questions,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
i
understand
mr.
terris,
even
though
you
did.
at
least
if
you're
in
the
first
amendment
area,
you're
not
entitled
he
says
to
be
told
on
the
basis
upon
which
the
question
was
asked.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
directly
mr.
rauh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
forget
the
fourth
amendment
argument
and
just
take
the
first
amendment.
you
say
you
raised
it
in
the
context
to
the
first
and
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
well,
(inaudible).
forget
the
fourth
for
a
minute.
you
raised
it
from
the
context
of
the
first
and
you
are
asked
a
question,
"are
you
a
communist?"
without
being
told
that
they
did
have
in
the
files
something
upon
which
they
felt
they
had
reasonable
ground
to
ask
that
question.
mr.
terris
says,
the
committee
had
no
obligation
whatever
to
tell
you
but
they
did
have
such
a
basis.
now,
how
do
you
meet
that
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
that
--
further,
supposed
he
said
had
--
supposed
the
chairman
had
said,
"well
we're
going
to
ask
you
this
because
we
have
in
our
file
a
letter
in
which
your
name
is
included
or
summoned
by
the
name
of
shelton
and
to
which
assigned
in
the
pseudonym
of
--
but
we're
not
going
to
show
you
the
letter,
but
that's
the
basis
upon
which
--
it's
that
information
upon
which
we
based
the
question."
what
can
you
say
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
witness
never
--
witness
first
testified
that
there
was
a
letter.
he
never
actually
withdrew
that
testimony.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
donner,
before
you
start,
i
gather
you're
going
to
give
us
the
facts
and
the
contexts
of
this
representation
election,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
what
you
said
earlier
that
you're
going
to
--
your
argument
is
going
to
be
that
the
aim
of
this
inquiry
was
specifically
to
injure
this
petitioner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
that
the
aim
of
the
inquiry
was
in
any
wise
to
affect
the
result
of
that
representation
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
on
your
argument
of
exposure
--
for
exposure
sake
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see
if
i
could
exclude
these
and
that
if
the
record
established
is
either
notwithstanding
--
we
don't
establish
that
injury
of
this
particular
petitioner
would
be
arguable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
do
establish,
that
it
was
--
to
effect
the
representation
election,
that
that
brings
the
inquiry
without
the
orbit
of
legitimate
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
house
--
are
there
any
evidence
that
the
house
committee
had
ever
published
that
dossier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
scheduled
date
for
the
election?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
union
win?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
issue
of
the
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
before
the
election?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
was
asked
whether
he
was
a
member,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
the
records
of
the
hearing?
