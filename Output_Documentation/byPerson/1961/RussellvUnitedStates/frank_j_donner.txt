mr.
frank
j.
donner
may
i
proceed?
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
like
the
(inaudible)
--
the
five
that
have
preceded
it,
a
contempt
case
arising
under
section
192
of
the
contempt
statute.
petitioner
here
was
found
guilty
in
a
six-count
indictment.
he
was
sentenced
to
nine
months
in
prison
and
fine
$250.
the
petition
here
raises
some
seven
issues.
four
of
them
have
been
discussed
in
one
form
or
another
during
the
train
of
arguments
that
the
court
has
heard.
and
i
want
to
confine
myself
here
to
one
argument
--
well,
really
two
arguments,
first
that
the
purpose
of
calling
petitioner
was
to
expose
him,
to
do
him
injury,
and
second
that
an
important
item
of
evidence
which
was
offered
below
was
erroneously
excluded
by
the
trial
judge.
this
item
of
evidence,
too,
dealt
with
the
question
of
exposure.
now,
let
it
be
said
at
the
very
beginning,
justice
harlan,
that
i
accept
the
premises
of
the
barenblatt
case
on
the
issue
of
exposure,
that
is,
i
--
assuming
i
know
what
the
barenblatt
case
holds,
namely
that
investigation
with
respect
to
communism
is
a
legislative
subject
matter.
and
that
it
does
not
--
the
fact
that
a
committee
is
investigating
communism,
however,
does
not
raise
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
it's
engaged
in
a
legitimate
legislative
endeavor
that
it
has
an
appropriate
legislative
purpose.
for
example,
in
the
barenblatt
case
itself,
that
the
court's
opinion
notes
that
--
notes
at
least
three
ways
in
which
this
presumed
legislative
purpose
might
be
overcome
by
a
showing,
for
example,
of
an
exertion
of
a
power
belonged
into
another
branch
of
government,
by
showing
of
a
lack
of
probable
cause
and
by
a
--
or
by
showing
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
pillory
a
witness.
so
that
--
i
think
that
the
issue
that
i
must
face
in
my
argument
is
what
did
the
committee
do
and
say
which
is
a
--
can
be
fairly
attributable
to
the
purposes
of
the
committee.
what
can
we
say
about
the
totality
of
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
purposes
of
the
committee
in
this
case?
now,
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
question
of
legislative
purpose
is
really
the
milk
and
the
coconut.
it's
the
exigent
thing
about
this
whole
investigative
process,
whether
you
view
it
as
the
justification
for
the
exercise
of
power
under
article
1
or
the
justification
for
the
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights
under
the
bill
of
rights.
there
must
be
a
legis
--
a
legislative
purpose
and
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
a
special
responsibility
to
find
such
a
purpose.
i
would
like
--
since
there
was
some
discussion
in
one
of
the
arguments
about
the
1857
statute,
i
think
justice
frankfurter
raised
the
question
about
it
as
well
as
justice
douglas,
i'd
like
to
read
a
brief
passage
from
the
debate
on
the
1857
contempt
statute.
senator
seward
objected
to
the
broad
language
of
the
1857
statute.
he
said,
“it
maybe
a
subject
on
which
congress
has
no
jurisdiction,
it
may
be
foreign
from
all
the
provisions
of
the
constitution,
it
may
be
a
local
question,
it
may
be
a
state
question,
it
may
be
a
personal
question.”
in
response,
senator
bayard,
who
was
one
of
the
sponsors
of
the
law
countered,
“i
am
aware
that
legislative
bodies
have
transcended
their
powers
--
that
under
the
influence
of
passion
and
political
excitement
they
have
very
often
invaded
the
rights
of
individuals,
and
may
have
invaded
the
rights
of
coordinate
branches
of
the
government;
but
if
our
institutions
are
to
last,
there
can
be
no
greater
safeguard
than
will
result
from
transferring
that
which
now
stands
on
an
indefinite
power,
the
punishment
as
well
as
the
offense
resting
in
the
breast
of
either
house
from
congress
to
the
courts
of
justice.”
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
we
--
that
the
court
here
has
a
great
responsibility
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
asserted
justification
for
the
exercise
of
legislative
power
really
exists.
now,
i
don't
contend
--
i
must
make
it
clear
that
merely
the
result
of
this
investigation
was
punitive.
i
don't
contend
that
my
client
was
innocently
--
innocently
hit
while
waiting
for
a
legislative
street
car.
i
contend
that
the
committee
intended
to
do
him
injury.
i
--
i
make
that
point
because
i
--
i've
been
--
the
court
below
said,
“well,
of
course,
if
a
result
is
injury,
you
can't
--
the
witness
can't
complain.”
i
agree.
i
think
everybody
recognizes
that
the
price
you
pay
for
making
a
contribution
to
the
clarification
of
issue
as
a
fact
maybe
injury.
my
point
is
that
there
was
a
purpose
here,
to
injure
my
client.
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
something
which
may
seem
trivial,
if
not
fearless,
but
it's
highly
important.
a
clue
to
this
case
is
that
it
was
--
it
was
a
hearing
which
was
held
in
the
carefree
days
before
watkins
when
the
committee
was
not
nearly
as
cautious
about
concealing
its
improprieties
as
it
is
today.
here,
i
think
the
evidence
of
what
the
committee
was
up
to
was
glaringly
revealed.
now,
the
second
general
point
that
i
want
to
make
before
sharing
the
facts
with
the
court
is
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
(inaudible)
here
of
what
happened.
it
isn't
just
one
fact,
it's
the
whole
pattern.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
no,
your
honor.
i
have
--
the
government
filed
a
brief
too
late
for
me
to
file
a
reply
brief.
and
at
--
but
it's
indicated
that
it
will
not
object
to
my
request
to
file
one,
and
i
would
like
to
file
a
reply
brief.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
be
glad
to
give
you
that.
that's

now
--
now
for
the
facts
--
mr.
frank
j.

no.
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
your
honor,
i
do
think
that
the
problem
has
acquired
several
new
dimensions
--
mr.

--
with
the
--
with
the
--
mr.
frank
j.

your
honor
--
mr.
frank

i
honestly
don't
think
so,
but
maybe
we'll
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
now
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
no,
your
honor.
there
has
never
been
a
committee,
for
example,
in
the
history
of
the
--
the
congress
that
i
know
about
to
whom
you
can
write
to
obtain
your
neighbor's
dossier.
there
has
never
been
such
a
--
such
a
committee
in
the
history
of
--
of
our
congress,
a
committee
who
--
which
maintain
a
dossier
of
millions
and
millions
of
individuals
which
supplies
them
on
request.
i
must
say
that
i'm
convinced
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
new
kind
of
institution,
a
new
kind
--
mr.
frank
j.

very
well,
your

mr.
frank
j.

yes.
mr.

mr.

well,
no.
i'm
going
to
do
both,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
i'm
--
yes,
i'm
arguing
that
both
of
these
were
improper
motivations,
your
honor,
and
that
they
will
both
encompass
within
the
plan
of
the
--
of
the
committee.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
right.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
yes,
your
honor.
and
once
more,
on
this,
we'll
say
at
this
point
that
i
--
i
think
--
that's
my
view
even
though
there
was
a
competing
legitimate
purpose
because
you
--
we
can't
decide
now
what
questions
were
asked
for
what
reason.
now
--
now,
we'll
go
on
to
the
facts.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
the
district
director
of
a
labor
union,
the
ue,
and
he
was
stationed
in
fort
wayne,
indiana
where
a
collective
bargaining
election
was
scheduled
for
february
24th,
1955.
on
february
9th,
the
local
press
in
fort
wayne
printed
a
statement
from
the
chairman,
obviously
based
on
an
interview
that
had
been
given
by
the
chairman
to
the
local
press
that
the
union
would
be
investigated,
and
the
story
added
that
a
committee
source
stated
that
mr.
gojack
and
another
witness
would
be
called.
now,
mind
you,
this
was
before
a
subpoena
was
even
issued
to
petitioner.
the
subpoena
was
issued
on
february
10th.
on
the
same
day
that
is
february
10th,
he
said
wire,
and
it
was
an
irate
and
harsh
wire.
you'll
here
more
about
it
i'm
sure
from
the
government.
but
he
had
a
reason
to
be
irate
and
harsh.
he
attacked
the
committee
and
pointed
out
that
no
election
was
pending
at
the
plant,
but
more
than
this
that
the
personal
--
personnel
director
at
the
plant,
a
man
named
mclaren
had
announced
to
the
employees
three
days
before
even
the
public
announcement
had
been
made
that
he
would
be
subpoenaed.
and
there
was
a
third
reason
why
he
was
angry.
the
previous
year,
the
--
the
personnel
director
had
circulated
in
the
plant
petitioner's
dossier
that
is
that
the
material
in
the
files,
in
the
committees'
files
about
the
petitioner,
and
of
course
used
it
for
labor-relations
purposes.
and
i
cross-examined
the
--
mr.
mclaren,
he
said
“why?”
he
just
asked
this
congressman
to
get
this
dossier,
then
he
reproduced
it
on
house
committee
--
the
house
committee
dossier
and
circulated
it
in
the
plant.
so
that's
the
first
sequence
of
events.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
no.
no
evidence
at
all,
your
honor.
and
i
--
and
that
--
it's
--
it's
quite
clear
that
this
was
a
dossier
from
the
committee's
files.
now
on
february
14th,
that's
a
few
days
later,
union
representative
went
to
seek
congressman
walter.
and
he
said,
“congressman,
look,
a
hearing
is
coming
up
--
our
collective
bargaining
election
is
coming
up
and
we
would
like
an
adjournment.”
during
the
course
of
this
hearing,
congressman
walter
said,
“no,
i
will
not
hear
your
request
for
adjourn
--
adjournment
except
in
a
public
hearing.”
so
he
called
the
press
in.
and
in
the
course
of
dealing
with
this
request
for
adjournment
he
said,
“i
want
to
see
the
union
go
out
of
business
because
it
is
not
good
for
the
country.
i
want
to
see
the
ue
go
out
of
business
because
it
is
not
good
for
the
country.”
this
was
in
the
course
of
a
mere
request
for
adjournment.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
not
by
--
not
by
--
not
by
--
the
epithets
were
in
the
wire,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
they
were
in
the
wires.
i'm
--
i'm
now
talking
about
the
--
the
hearing
at
which
the
request
for
the
adjournment
was
discussed.
now,
of
course,
the
next
--
next
day,
they
appeared
on
the
local
papers
where
the
election
was
scheduled,
a
headline
which
said
that
“house
un-american
activity
wants
ue
out
of
business.”
on
february
7th
--
17th,
that's
a
few
days
after
this
request
for
adjournment,
the
committee
did
give
an
adjournment
until
february
28.
and
of
course,
the
government
will
point
to
this
to
show
how
benign
the
committee
was.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
24th,
your
honor.
the
government
as
i
say
--
will
say
--
“well
look
--
look
what
a
favor
the
committee
--
the
committee
did
for
union
by
postponing
this
election.
how
can
you
say
they
were
out
to
get
to
the
union?”
the
answer
is
very
simple.
congressman
walter
then
made
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
which
of
course,
was
duly
reported
in
the
press
in
which
he
said,
“i
want
all
these
magnavox
workers
to
repudiate
this
union.
and
what's
more,
the
only
reason
we
are
postponing
the
election
is
because
we're
afraid
that
if
we
hold
it,
the
union
might
win.”
so,
the
hearing
was
postponed.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
no,
they
lost.
the
hearing
was
postponed.
a
second
subpoena
was
issued
on
february
23rd
for
a
hearing
on
february
28th,
again,
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
fort
wayne
situation,
the
second
subpoena
was
leaked.
before
it
was
served
on
my
client,
an
item
appeared
in
the
local
press,
and
i
read
this
item.
i'll
read
the
significant
part
of
it.
this
is
an
interview
with
congressman
walter
by
the
saint
louis
--
by
the
saint
joseph
herald
express
in
which
congressman
walter
says
about
two
of
the
witnesses,
“we
intend
to
bring
out
the
facts
that
they
are
card-carrying
communists.”
mr.
frank
j.
donner
this
was
february
21st.
again
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
this
was
again
before
another
election.
you
see,
the
editor
of
the
saint
joseph
herald
express,
where
the
whirlpool
company
is
located,
called
up
the
committee
and
got
this
statement
from
--
from
mr.
walter.
and
what
did
he
say?
he
said,
“we
intend
to
bring
out
the
facts
that
they
are
card-carrying
communist.
the
rest
is
up
to
the
community.”
now,
if
ever
there
was
an
intention
to
do
injury
to
someone,
this
is
it.
in
fact,
this
is
the
classic
strategy
of
modern
repression,
the
public
identification
of
the
victim
and
the
stimulation
of
private
sanction
so
that
he
may
be
injured.
and
this
court
has
seen
in
a
train
of
cases
that
have
come
before
you
just
how
this
has
worked,
just
how
this
has
become
the
classic
pattern.
now,
you
may
say,
“well,
that's
a
newspaper
clipping.
that's
what
the
government
tells
me.
it's
a
newspaper
clipping.”
but
there
are
important
things
about
this
newspaper
clipping.
i
subpoenaed
chairman
walter.
and
instead
of
coming,
the
government
offered
to
stipulate
that
if
called,
he
would
concede,
that
this
statement
was
made
and
that
it
was
accurate.
there
is
no
question
of
its
accuracy.
there
is
no
question
of
its
authenticity.
also,
i
want
you
note
that
he
didn't
say,
“i
intend
to
show
anything,”
he
said
“we
intend
to
show
that
they
are
card-carrying
communists
and
the
rest
is
up
to
community.”
he
didn't
say,
“we're
going
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
labor
and
communism.”
and
incidentally,
as
a
result
of
this,
meaning
--
we
may
reluctantly
have
to
identify
somebody
as
a
communist.
oh,
no,
he
didn't
say
that.
he
said,
“we
intend
to
show
they
are
card-carrying
communists
and
the
rest
is
up
to
community.”
so
that
you
have
here
--
you
have
here
a
pattern
of
leaks
to
the
press
and
of
attempts
to
use
the
investigative
power
as
the
means
of
influencing
the
election
as
well
as
promising
to
injure
this
one
individual.
now,
after
--
at
the
hearing,
the
counsel
for
petitioner
of
--
at
the
--
the
committee
hearing,
the
counsel
for
petitioner
filed
a
motion.
and
the
motion
he
--
he
--
was
in
the
form
of
a
statement
of
objections
to
the
hearing
as
well
as
a
motion
to
vacate
the
subpoenas,
and
the
motion
said,
“we
don't
think
that
the
objective
of
breaking
a
union
or
showing
that
someone
is
a
card-carrying
communist
so
that
the
community
can
work
its
will
on
him,
we
don't
think
that
these
are
legitimate
objects
of
legislative
concern.”
this
motion
was
filed.
the
committee
did
nothing
about
the
motion
really.
it
noted
that
it
was
filed.
and
at
the
end
of
the
hearing,
it
denied
the
motion
nunc
pro
tunc.
in
the
course
of
the
hearing,
the
witness
are
not
--
how
far
back
the
tunc
went,
but
that's
a
matter
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
during
the
course
of
the
hearing,
the
witness
here
was
asked
about
500
questions
--
all
kinds
of
questions
about
where
he
went
to
school,
whether
he
was
drafted
or
not
drafted,
and
of
whom
--
who
stay
--
stayed
with
whom
when
he
filed
out
--
filed
a
--
an
application
for
a
passport.
all
of
which
--
certainly
at
--
looking
at
spontaneously,
suggesting
that
the
committee
was
trying
to
do
exactly
what
it
promised
to
do.
it
never
did
show
that
petitioner
was
a
card-carrying
communist
or
indeed
any
other
kind
of
communist.
but
i
suppose
that
was
just
a
little
(inaudible)
on
the
part
of
congressman
walter.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
yes,
and
he
refused
to
answer
that
on
first
amendment
ground.
the
witness
refused
to
answer
the
questions
which
are
here
in
issue
on
three
grounds,
on
the
first
amendment
grounds
--
on
the
first
amendment
ground
on
exposure
on
the
ground
that
this
was
an
attempt
to
expose
him
and
hence
lacking
in
legislative
purpose,
and
on
the
ground
that
he
had
signed
for
many
years
non-communist
oath
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
now,
i
would
like
at
this
point
to
deal
with
the
evidence
question
because
in
my
view,
the
evidence
question
significantly
clarifies
and
unifies
what
happened
in
this
whole
series
of
actions
and
statements
that
i've
talking
about.
they
weren't
just
statements
that
were
made
spontaneously.
they
all
are
explained
and
unified
by
an
interview
which
congressman
walter
had
with
the
press
right
before
he
became
chairman.
and,
i
would
like,
if
your
honors
please,
to
read
the
interview.
this
appears
in
the
record
at
page
214.
and
of
course
this
was
a
kind
of
interview
that
a
chairman
to
be
gives
the
press
right
before
he
becomes
chairman.
and
the
chairman
was
interviewed,
congressman
walter,
in
november
of
1954.
and
he
was
asked,
“well,
what
are
your
plans
when
you
become
chairman?”
and
here
is
what
he
said,
and
i'm
reading
this
press
account,
“francis
e.
walter,
who
will
take
charge
in
the
new
congress
of
house
activities
against
communists
and
their
sympathizers,
has
a
new
plan
for
driving
reds
out
of
important
industries.
he
said
today,
he
plans
to
hold
large
public
hearings
in
industrial
communities
where
subversives
are
known
to
be
operating
and
to
give
known
suspected
communist
a
chance
in
a
full
glamour
of
publicity
to
deny
or
affirm
their
connections
with
the
revolutionary
conspiracy
or
take
shelter
behind
constitutional
amendments."
by
this
means
he
said,
active
communists
will
be
exposed
before
their
neighbors
and
fellow
workers
and
now
i'm
quoting,
“and
i
have
every
confidence
that
the
loyal
americans
will
work
with
them
will
do
the
rest
of
the
job.”
hearings
of
a
similar
nature
continuing
the
--
the
account,
have
been
held
in
local
areas,
but
representative
walter
wants
to
make
them
bigger
where
the
public
being
erred
as
well
as
invited
to
attend.
“we
will
force
these
people
we
know
to
be
communists
to
appear
by
the
power
of
subpoena,”
representative
walter
said,
“and
we'll
demonstrate
to
their
fellow
workers
that
they
are
part
of
a
foreign
conspiracy.”
now,
here
too,
there
is
no
question.
it's
been
conceded
that
congressman
walter
said
that.
that
it's
an
accurate
account
of
what
he
said.
the
only
issue
is
--
the
only
issue
that
government
raised
is
whether
this
is
relevant.
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
it's
highly
relevant.
first,
it
was
made
by
the
future
chairman
who
certainly
ought
to
know
what
the
program
of
the
committee
was
to
be.
second,
and
this
is
extremely
important,
this
--
this
statement
was
the
statement
that
was
made
immediately
prior
to
this
hearing
or
to
turn
it
around,
this
hearing
was
the
first
hearing
that
was
held
after
the
statement
was
made.
in
other
words,
the
first
investigative
act
that
was
taken
under
this
new
plan
was
the
fort
wayne
hearing.
and,
your
honor,
you
can
find
that
from
the
--
in
the
index
which
is
published
by
the
--
by
both
--
mcclellan
committee
has
an
index
as
well
as
the
house
committee
of
the
hearings.
and
you
will
find
that
--
that
this
hearing
occurred
directly
after
--
that
is
the
first
hearing
after
the
statement
was
made.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
this
should
have
been
admitted
into
the
record
by
the
district
court
because
it
was
the
statement
which
most
closely
reflected
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
committee
in
this
overall
plan
and
finally
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
yes,
it
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
well,
your
honor,
i
think
this
sort
of
unifies
it.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
no,
it
would
not
have
made
a
difference
to
the
case.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
but
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
oh
that
goes
without
saying,
but
the
question
is
what
does
he
do,
your
honor.
what
my
--
what
my
complaint
is
that
he
was
in
sort
of
instigating
a
dry
lynching.
he
was
saying,
“i'm
going
to
hold
these
hearings
and
you
go
out,
you
fellow
americans
and
do
there
--
do
your
job.”
mr.
frank
j.
donner
oh,
well,
i
think
it's
stronger
because
he
didn't
say
a
word.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
well,
i
think
it's
a
stronger
case
because
it
unified
everything
that
followed
it.
now,
let
me
--
let
me
show
you
what
i
mean.
there
are
two
--
there
are
things
in
what
he
said.
he
said,
first,
that
he
wanted
to
ex
--
that
i'm
talking
now
about
the
november
statement.
he
said,
first,
that
he
wanted
to
expose
communists
to
the
full
glare
of
publicity
so
that
loyal
americans
will
work
with
--
with
them,
will
do
the
rest
of
the
job.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
your
honor,
i
think
that
every
committee
occasionally
lapses
into
exposure,
but
the
point
i'm
making
here
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
my
--
my
point
is
that
you
couldn't
get
a
stronger
case.
this
--
this
committee
could
have
hired
a
sandwich
man
to
go
out
on
the
street
and
say,
“why
--
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
expose
all
these
people
and
you,
americans,
go
out
there
and
take
them
on,
run
them
out
of
plants,
boycott
them,
discharge
them
and
so
on.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
what
--
what
company
who
have
said
this
more
clearly?
now
--
and
oddly
enough,
what
does
it
--
what
does
this
statement
contain?
it
contains
the
two
elements
that
i
talked
about
before,
the
exposure
of
witnesses
and
the
appeal
to
the
public
to
do
the
rest.
and
of
course,
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
our
record.
the
--
he
called
up
these
--
these
newspapers
and
said,
“i'm
going
to
expose
these
people,
and
you
local
people
do
the
rest.”
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
clearer
example
of
an
improper
motivation.
now,
i
don't
say
that
this
is
the
only
case
in
which
the
committee
is
improperly
motivated.
but
i
say,
it's
one
of
the
cases
in
which
they've
shown
how
improperly
motivated
they
are.
now,
the
government
has
suggested
that
there's
something
in
barenblatt
which
says
that
a
court
is
bound
by
the
statements
of
a
subcommittee
chairman
and
that
since
congressman
moulder
said
when
the
witness
came
before
him,
“this
is
a
hearing
about
communism
and
labor”,
he
was
a
subcommittee
chairman
who
conducted
the
hearing,
“that
therefore
we
can't
go
behind
that.”
now,
this
is
odd
to
me.
i
presented
the
emspak
case
to
this
court.
and
i
showed
the
emspak
case
that
many
of
the
committee
members
said,
“exposure,
we're
going
to
expose
you.”
and
the
government
said,
“aha!
but
that's
not
the
chairman.”
well,
this
is
the
chairman.
the
chairman
of
the
committee
said,
“this
is
our
purpose.”
and
what's
more,
this
wasn't
the
chairman
who
was
alienated
from
the
subject
matter.
he
knew
all
about
it.
he
--
his
whole
--
his
whole
course
of
conduct
was
intimately
related
to
it.
then,
i
want
to
point
out
that
a
chairman
in
an
investigating
committee
has
a
peculiarly
important
role
under
rule
iii
of
the
house
rules,
“he
is
the
only
man
who
can
issue
subpoenas.”
under
rule
iii
of
the
house
rules
in
jefferson's
manual,
“he
is
the
only
member
of
the
committee
who
was
elected
by
the
whole
house.”
he
was
the
member
of
the
committee
--
he
was
the
chairman
who
created
this
subcommittee.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
say
that
you're
going
to
simply
brush
aside
all
of
these
things,
incidentally,
the
government
does
brushed
it
aside.
nowhere
will
you
find
in
the
government's
brief
any
reference
to
these
interviews.
they
simply
sneer
at
these
newspaper
clippings
as
though,
you
know,
there's
something
about
a
newspaper
which
inherently
disqualified
the
piece
of
evidence.
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
fact
that
he
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
oh,
no
question
of
it.
no
question
of
it.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
yes.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
except,
your
honor.
i
must
say
the
last
item
i
read
was
excluded
and
i
say
it
was
improperly
excluded.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
that
the
chairman
said
it,
the
fact
also
that
there
is
no
formal
resolution
stating
what
the
purpose
of
the
committee
is.
you
see,
since
watkins,
the
committee
has
taken
to
passing
formal
resolutions
saying,
“we
are
going
to
do
so
and
so
and
so
and
so,
and
a
subcommittee
of
such
and
such
and
such
and
such
is
appointed.”
i'm
sure,
your
honor,
you've
seen
cases
like
that.
there
is
no
such
formal
resolution
in
this
case,
and
so
we
have
the
chairman
stating
this
thing
and
then
you
have
what
congressman
moulder
said
in
--
as
--
as
the
subcommittee
chairman.
i
see
that
my
time
is
expired,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
file
a
reply
brief.
the
government
has
said
it
would
not
oppose.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
thank
you,
your
honor.
