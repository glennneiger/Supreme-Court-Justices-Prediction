mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
our
view
that
the
indictments
in
each
of
these
cases
which
are
for
purposes
of
the
argument
just
made
substantially
identical
conform
to
the
requirements
of
rule
7
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
in
that
they
are
plain,
concise
and
definite
written
statements
of
the
essential
allegations
of
the
offense.
as
justice
whittaker
suggested,
it
is
well-established
that
indictments
in
the
statutory
language
are
ordinarily
sufficient.
that
was
the
rule
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
debrow
case.
it
was
also
repeated
in
the
markham
case,
which
is
particularly
apposite
here
because
the
markham
case
involved
a
determination
by
the
court
of
the
sufficiency
of
an
averment
in
the
indictment
that
the
alleged
false
statement,
that
was
perjury
case,
the
alleged
false
statement
was
material
to
a
question
on
an
--
then
under
inquiry
by
the
veterans
administration.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
markham.
yes,
sir.
it
was
cited
in
--
in
our
shelton
brief.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
this
--
this
argument
is
made
in
shelton
and
since
this
was
the
first
brief
or
the
first
case
set
for
argument,
we
have
developed
this
point
primarily
in
the
shelton
brief
and
refer
to
it
and
incorporated
in
the
--
in
the
other
briefs
where
the
question
is
raised.
it's
referred
to
on
page
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
your
honor
it
is
argued
our
essential
position
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
this
case
at
pages
38
and
39
in
which
we
incorporate
the
developed
argument
as
set
forth
in
the
shelton
brief.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
we
were
--
we
were
trying
to
--
to
make
it
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
so
that
we
wouldn't
be
unnecessarily
repeating
legal
arguments
in
each
brief
which
were
common
to
several
cases.
and
our
--
we
tried
to
--
to
--
to
develop
a
--
a
master
brief
so
called
since
these
cases
were
all
set
together
and
to
try
to
eliminate,
insofar
as
possible,
unnecessary
duplicate
reading
as
to
what
our
position
is.
at
any
rate,
your
honor,
the
markham
case
which
--
which
we
do
refer
to
in
--
at
--
in
the
shelton
brief
at
page
80,
the
court
there
held
that
the
mere
averment
that
the
false
statement
was
material
to
the
matter
under
inquiry
by
the
veterans
administration
was
sufficient.
the
averment
of
materiality
in
a
perjury
case
is
directly
analogous
it
seems
to
us,
to
the
averment
of
subject
matter
and
pertinency
in
a
contempt
of
congress
case.
and
it
is
our
position
that
in
--
in
light
of
the
established
principles
of
these
cases,
the
allegation
that
the
--
there
was
a
subject
under
inquiry
and
that
the
questions
refused
of
answer
were
pertinent
to
those
--
to
that
inquiry
is
a
sufficient
averment.
what
the
subject
under
inquiry
was
--
is
a
matter
of
proof.
the
--
the
circumstances
which
demonstrate
the
pertinency
of
the
particular
questions
is
that
--
to
the
subject
under
inquiry
is
a
matter
of
proof.
now,
we
think
it
also
well-established
that
--
as
established
in
the
markham
case
and
in
the
debrow
case
that
the
--
the
test
for
the
sufficiency
of
an
indictment
is
whether
or
not
it
sufficiently
appraises
as
a
defense
of
the
specific
charge
for
which
he
is
to
be
tried
and
enables
him
to
prepare
a
defense
and
whether
it
is
sufficiently
precise
to
enable
to
him
to
plead
it
in
bar
of
a
subsequent
prosecution
for
the
same
offense
and
we
submit
the
indictments
in
these
cases,
particularly
in
this
case
meets
that
test.
now,
the
contention
is
made
that
because
the
subject
under
inquiry
is
a
nebulously,
that
--
in
view
of
that
particular
of
circumstance
in
this
type
of
case,
the
court
should
depart
from
the
general
principle
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
indictments
and
require,
especially
as
concerns
contempt
of
congress
cases
that
the
government
or
that
the
grand
jury
set
fourth
in
the
indictment
what
the
subject
under
inquiry
was.
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
that
when
the
--
when
a
defendant
is
appraised
as
he
was
in
this
indictment
and
in
the
other
indictments
of
the
subcommittee
or
the
committee
concerning
which
he
is
alleged
to
have
appeared
and
to
have
refused
to
answer
questions,
when
the
specific
questions
are
set
forth
in
the
indictment
as
they
are
all
of
these
cases,
together
with
the
allegations
that
they
were
pertinent
to
the
subject
then
under
inquiry
that
he
is
in
a
position
to
prepare
his
defense.
the
record
here
--
the
--
the
hearings
of
the
committee
which
are
available
to
him
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
--
for
trial,
in
this
particular
case
leave
no
room
for
doubt
so
as
to
confuse
a
defendant
with
what
he
has
to
meet
in
a
--
in
the
criminal
trial.
the
--
this
record
shows
that
the
committee
or
that
--
the
committee
which
conducted
the
hearings
in
dayton
as
distinguished
from
a
subsequent
committee
which
followed
up
on
those
hearings
here
in
washington
and
that
which
the
petitioner
appeared.
the
--
the
committee
in
dayton
announced
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearings
that
it
was
going
to
investigate
communist
activities
generally
in
the
dayton
and
yellow
springs
area.
now,
the
opening
statement
does
refer
to
a
lot
of
things.
it
refers
to
legislation.
it
refers
to
the
communist
conspiracy
and
the
international
situation
and
so
forth,
but
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
from
an
overall
reading
of
that
as
to
what
the
committee
intended
to
do
at
these
hearings
in
dayton
that
is
to
investigate
communist
activities
in
that
area,
dayton
and
yellow
springs
area.
now,
if
there
where
any
doubt
from
the
opening
statement,
the
hearings
themselves
and
the
questions
which
were
put
to
the
particular
witnesses
demonstrate
beyond
all
question
that
the
committee's
interest
and
that
the
committee's
area
of
inquiry
was
communist
activities
in
the
dayton,
yellow
springs
area.
they
--
they
interrogated
the
witness
strunk
concerning
his
knowledge
of
the
organizational
structure
in
the
dayton
area,
his
knowledge
of
certain
leaders
of
the
communist
party
in
that
area,
his
knowledge
of
communist
party
infiltration
in
--
in
that
particular
area.
there
were
other
witnesses
called
who
testified
as
to
communist
activities
in
the
yellow
springs
area,
as
to
the
existence
of
a
young
communist
leagues
cell
at
antioch
college
which
is
in
yellow
springs,
as
to
the
petitioner's
membership
in
the
communist
party.
all
those
things
and
only
that
type
of
thing
were
developed
throughout
the
hearings
conducted
in
dayton.
now,
if
that
weren't
enough,
and
i
think
that
this
court
clearly,
in
the
watkins
case
and
in
the
barenblatt
cases,
said
that
the
subject
done
under
inquiry
can
be
determined
from
the
statement
of
the
chairman
at
the
outset
of
the
hearings,
from
the
resolution
of
the
committee
here
concededly
as
the
court
has
held
in
the
watkins
case,
the
resolution
itself
does
not
add
materially
to
a
determination
of
what
the
subject
under
inquiry
was.
what
the
opening
statement
does
and
properly
can,
the
interrogation
of
the
witnesses
at
the
hearings
do
in
this
case
unquestionably,
establish
that
this
committee
was
inquiring
into
communist
activities
generally
in
the
dayton
and
yellow
springs
area
and
in
conducting
such
a
general
investigation,
it
necessarily,
as
any
such
investigation
would,
encompassed
within
such
a
general
investigation
certain,
more
specialized,
more
particularized
subjects,
infiltration
of
the
communist
party
in
to
the
ue
the
united
electrical
workers'
union.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
the
dayton
and
area,
yes
sir
and
several
leaders
of
the
ue
were
called
and
were
asked
to
testify
concerning
certain
strike
activities.
i
think
particularly
concerning
a
univis
--
a
strike
at
the
univis
lens
corporation
which
is
in
that
area
at
which
the
committee
tried
to
develop
to
what
extent
the
communist
party
and
its
leaders
had
been
sent
in
during
that
strike
to,
you
sir
so
to
speak,
the
functions
of
the
union
in
the
conduct
of
the
strike.
now,
as
i
say,
if
that
were
not
enough,
when
the
witness
--
this
witness
himself,
the
petitioner
came
before
the
committee,
he
was
not
left
floundering
at
all
for
what
the
committee
was
trying
to
find
out
from
him
when
he
first
--
he
answered
preliminary
questions,
and
these
statements
which
i'll
try
to
paraphrase
begin
in
the
record
of
pages
123.
he
has
--
he
was
--
he
asked
preliminary
questions
as
to
his
attendance
at
antioch
as
to
his
working
in
yellow
springs
during
the
critical
time
period,
his
working
in
antioch
and
his
residence
there.
he
--
he
was
told
by
both
committee
counsel
and
by
the
members
of
the
committee,
and
beginning
down
at
the
bottom
of
123,
they
made
reference
to
two
witnesses
who
would
appear
the
date
of
the
hearings,
john
o'brien
and
bb
o'brien,
husband
and
wife
who
had
testified
as
to
their
prior
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
who
had
testified
as
to
the
existence
of
a
young
communist
league
cell
at
antioch
college
in
about
1942.
their
testimony
also
demonstrated
that
the
leader
and
the
organizer
of
this
young
communist
league
group
at
antioch
was
herbert
reed,
who
was
a
communist
party
functionary
from
dayton,
who
had
no
connection
with
antioch
college
as
such.
but
that
he
had
come
in
to
the
--
to
the
campus
and
had
organized
this
ycl
group.
they
also
referred
the
witness
to
testimony
that
had
been
given
before
the
--
the
committee
at
the
dayton
hearings,
testimony
of
professor
robert
matchan
who
was
on
the
faculty
at
antioch
and
which
indicated
to
the
committee's
satisfaction
the
existence
of
a
communist
party
group
in
1945
or
1946.
and
they
--
they
said
after
having
made
those
points
to
the
petitioner,
they
said
on
page
126
of
the
record
at
the
--
at
the
top,
having
referred
to
the
ycl
group
in
1942
at
antioch
and
the
1945
communist
party
cell
at
which
certain
members
of
the
faculty
or
of
which
certain
members
of
the
faculty
were
members.
they
say,
now
there's
an
important
link
in
between
the
actual
organizers;
communist
party
organizers
in
1945
were
not
known.
you
may
be
in
a
position
to
supply
that
information
to
the
committee.
we
know
what
it
was
in
1942.
we
are
asking
you
now
to
supply
the
missing
link
to
that
testimony.
the
--
the
--
the
other
evidence
that
committee
had,
had
already
demonstrated
that
he
--
he
had
been
or
at
least
he
was
identified
as
having
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
about
this
time,
he's
working
in
this
area
and
certainly
there
was
the
likelihood
that
he
could
furnish
for
the
committee.
if
he
would
--
whatever
information
he
had,
which
might
shed
--
shed
information
on
the
three-year
period
of
communist
activities
between
dayton
and
yellow
springs
and
antioch
of
which
the
committee
had
a
void.
he
was
told
that
he
--
he
was
told
i
think
very
clearly,
that
is
the
information
we're
trying
to
get
from
you.
this
is
the
reason
why
we
think
you
can
give
it
to
us.
will
you
answer
this
question,
or
several
questions
and
his
reply
was
that
he
refused
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment.
now
we
think
no
circumstances
that
there
is
just
no
question
at
all
that
this
petitioner
in
preparing
his
case
for
trial
on
the
criminal
contempt
charge
certainly
was
in
a
position
to
properly
prepare
his
defense
and
to
make
whatever
defenses
he
had
available
to
him,
and
that
being
the
case
we
submit
that
this
indictment
meets
quite
far
the
test
for
the
sufficiency
of
an
indictment.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
they're
20
miles
apart,
yes
sir.
the
record
--
the
record
contains
that
information
and
i
think
the
petitioner
--
this
petitioner
is
during
the
course
of
his
testimony
before
the
committee,
they
asked
him
if
he
--
he
went
back
and
forth,
and
he
said
they
were
about
20
miles
apart
and
that
he
did
go
back
and
forth
during
this
time
and
antioch
--
antioch
college
is
in
yellow
springs.
now,
the
--
another
point
which
is
--
which
was
not
made
orally,
but
which
has
been
extensively
briefed
in
this
case,
and
which
is
also
raised
in
several
of
the
other
cases
which
are
to
be
heard
after
this
concerns
motions
of
the
petitioners
in
a
number
of
these
cases
including
this
case
made
before
trial
to
dismiss
the
indictments,
to
dismiss
this
indictment,
i'll
confine
it
to
this
case,
motion
to
dismiss
this
indictment
or
in
the
alternative
for
a
hearing
on
the
ground
that
more
than
--
that
13
or
more
of
the
indicting
grand
jurors
were
employees
of
the
federal
or
district
government,
and
therefore,
according
to
affidavits
submitted
in
support
of
the
motions,
affidavits
which
are
principally
i
might
say,
based
on
the
opinions
of
their
counsel
and
in
this
case,
on
a
preliminary
survey
resulting
in
opinions
expressed
by
professors
jahoda
and
cooke,
opinions
to
the
effect
that
a
government
employee
in
1954
necessarily
would
have
been
so
intimidated
and
so
fearful
as
a
result
of
the
government
loyalty
program
that
he
ought
to
be
held
as
a
matter
of
law
to
be
a
biased
grand
juror
in
this
kind
of
case.
now,
basically
our
primary
contention
is
that
the
supporting
affidavits
in
these
cases
which
were
submitted
in
support
of
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and
in
the
alternative
for
a
motion,
for
a
preliminary
hearing
on
that
question
do
not
contain
any
specific
facts
as
to
actual
bias
by
these
particular
grand
jurors,
and
we
think
that
since
that
is
so
at
the
under
the
--
under
the
case
law
and
under
the
--
what
appears
to
us
to
be
the
prevailing
rule
with
respect
to
challenges
to
grand
juries
that
these
petitioners
--
this
petitioner
was
not
entitled
either
to
a
hearing,
certainly
was
not
entitled
to
a
dismiss
along
the
indictment.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir.
there
originally
was
a
statute
or
a
provision
which
disqualified
government
employees
from
service
as
jurors
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
because
of
the
difficultly
of
getting
grand
jury
--
jury
panels,
congress
passed
a
statute
in
i
think
it
was
1908
or
thereabouts,
which
was
the
subject
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
case
of
wood
v.
united
states
which
is
cited
also
in
our
shelton
brief,
it's
299
u.s.
123.
in
--
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
that
statute
authorizing
government
employees
to
sit
as
jurors
in
criminal
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
constitutional.
the
question
of
government
employees
sitting
in
criminal
--
as
jurors
in
criminal
cases
in
the
district
also
was
considered
by
this
court
in
the
frazier
case,
which
is
also
cited
in
the
brief.
the
frazier
case
involved
a
--
a
prosecution
of
an
individual
for
violation
of
the
narcotics
laws
i
believe.
the
defendant
challenged
the
impartiality
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
implied
bias
of
a
government
employee
rendering
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict
in
a
case
where
the
government,
where
his
employer
was
the
--
was
the
prosecutor,
was
the
party
to
the
case.
and
this
court
held
that
the
fact
of
government
employment
did
not
render
a
government
employee
impartial
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
matter
of
showing
in
any
particular
case
with
respect
to
any
particular
juror
that
he
--
he
was
in
fact
intimidated
by
virtue
of
his
employment
could
be
shown
on
voir
dire
examination
and
of
course
would
be
a
proper
question
for
voir
dire
examination.
but
in
the
absence
of
such
is
showing
as
to
actual
bias
or
fear
on
the
part
of
the
particular
juror,
the
court
would
not
impute
from
the
circumstances
of
employment
alone
that
he
was
not
an
impartial
jury.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir,
the
--
that's
--
that's
another
important
distinction
we
think
applies
here.
there
is
no
prevision
that
we
know
of
in
the
federal
system
for
voir
dire
examination
in
the
usual
sense
as
to
determine
bias
with
respect
to
grand
jurors.
the
rules
--
rule
6
of
the
federal
rules
criminal
procedure
do
provide
for
challenges
to
the
grand
jury
or
to
any
grand
jury
on
the
basis
that
the
grand
jury
lacks
legal
quali
--
the
legal
qualifications,
that
is
that
some
of
the
grand
jurors
don't
meet
the
residence
requirements
or
the
age
requirements
and
so
forth.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct
sir,
or
that
a
particular
grand
juror
may
not
be
legally
qualified.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
sir,
or
at
least
it
might
--
it
might
of
showing
that
grand
juror
was
not
legally
qualified,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure,
would
necessarily
disqualify
the
entire
panel,
but
there
is
a
provision
at
any
rate
under
the
rule
for
a
challenge
to
the
grand
jury
on
the
basis
of
legal
qualifications
only.
there
is
no
provision
for
a
challenge
to
a
grand
jury
on
the
basis
of
bias.
now,
we
think
that
that
rule
also
carries
over
following
the
return
of
an
indictment,
so
that
you
can
challenge
or
at
least
embark
that
--
we
think
this
much
is
clear
anyway
that
what
they
would
like
to
do,
and
that
is
to
embark
on
a
fishing
expedition
trying
to
probe
the
grand
jury
that
returned
an
indictment,
trying
to
probe
its
motives
and
its
fears,
and
its
biases
hoping
that
something
will
turn
up
so
that
they
can
then
use
that
as
a
basis
for
challenge.
we
think
that
that
certainly
is
not
prohibited
and
has
no
support
whatever
in
any
of
the
case
law
in
the
federal
system
or
in
the
state
system.
now,
certain
other
cases,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
do
hold
and
we
think
properly
so,
that
where
a
defendant
can
show
that
a
particular
grand
juror
or
group
of
grand
jurors
were
biased
as
a
result
of
corruption
or
malice
that
the
court
will
--
and
upon
such
as
showing,
upon
an
actual,
factual
demonstration
that
that
was
the
case
that
the
court
would
in
the
--
certainly
in
the
exercise
of
its
powers
to
supervise
criminal
justice
will
set
aside
such
an
indictment
(voice
overlap)
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
if
it
were
just
one
grand
juror?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
all
13
of
these
were
relatives?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
i
think,
probably
that
would
be
a
sufficient
showing
of
--
of
actual
bias
which
--
for
example
i
think
some
of
the
cases
have
held
that
a
showing
of
financial
interest
on
the
part
of
a
--
of
a
grand
juror.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
of
course,
in
that
kind
of
case
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
--
well
the
court
will,
depending
on
what
the
underlying
circumstances
are,
find
actual
bias
by
virtue
of
the
circumstances
of
a
case,
for
example.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
that's
right.
for
example
in
the
frazier
case,
which
--
we
mentioned
earlier,
several
of
the
--
this
is
the
petit
jury
now
in
the
frazier
case,
and
the
court
held
that
the
government
employees
were
not
--
should
not
be
held
to
be
biased
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they're
government
employees
alone.
two
of
the
particular
government
employees
were
later
shown
to
have
been
employed
by
the
treasury
department
which
was
the
--
the
very
department
which
had
investigated
this
offense
--
the
narcotics
bureau
or
the
treasury
department.
the
court
pointed
out
in
frazier
that
neither
of
these
employees
of
the
treasury
department
were
employed
in
the
narcotics
bureau.
they
were
employed
in
some
other
--
i
think
if
they
were
employed
in
the
narcotics
bureau
then
it
might
be
said
that
that
particular
juror
should
be
held
to
be
sufficiently
close
to
an
interested
party
that
he
should
be
disqualified.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
to
a
certain
extent
i
suppose
that
applies
to
all
government
employees.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
of
course,
we
rely
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
dennis
case,
which
was
later
case
of
--
of
frazier,
and
the
dennis
case
involved
contempt
of
congress
case,
involved
an
individual
who
like
--
this
petitioner
was
charged
with
having
to
refuse
to
testify
concerning
communist
party
activities.
there,
it
was
the
petit
jury.
the
petit
jury
which
was
indeed
determined
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
particular
defendant
and
in
this
court
in
the
dennis
case
held
that
fact
and
even
in
view
of
the
newly
--
of
the
then
newly
existing
loyalty
order
that
the
--
the
--
there
shouldn't
be
imputed
two
government
employees
such
as
a
bias
as
to
make
them
disqualified.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
petit
juries
your
honor
and
we
think
that
is
on
a
very
important
distinction.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
--
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
true
your
honor,
but
that
is
because
of
the
traditional
view
of
the
court
with
respect
to
grand
jury
proceedings.
the
grand
jury,
unlike
the
petit
jury
of
course,
is
strictly
an
accusatory
body.
certainly,
traditionally,
there
is
no
impediment
to
a
grand
juror,
or
several
grand
jurors
taking
part
in
proceedings
of
which
they
may
have
personal
knowledge
for
example.
in
a
small
community,
it
may
--
it
may
happen
from
time-to-time,
whereas
presumably
somebody
like
that
might
be
disqualified
from
a
petit
jury,
but
we
think
that
the
distinction
that
the
courts
--
that
the
actual
distinction
between
the
function
of
a
grand
jury
and
the
function
of
a
petit
jury
makes
it
far
less
imperative
that
the
court
allow
an
inquiry
of
voir
dire
based
on
such
general
assumptions
as
we
have
here,
such
general
opinions
has
have
been
shown
in
these
affidavits
supporting
the
motions
and
exploratory
inquiry
into
the
fears
or
the
motives
of
grand
jurors.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
we
can
certainly
get
them
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
it
would
be
clear
to
all
of
us
that
it
would
certainly
be
50%.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
certainly
wouldn't
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh,
no,
no,
no.
no,
but
i
think
as
your
honor
knows
that
it
was
that
problem--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
that
arose
--
that
gave
rise
to
the
statute
which
--
which
didn't
make
federal
employees,
competent
juries
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
so
that
--
we
think
that,
certainly
on
--
on
the
showing
that
they
may,
and
the
lack
of
any
specific
facts,
the
lack
of
even
of
any
allegations
of
actual
bias
on
the
part
of
anyone
of
the
grand
juror,
that's
the
indicting
grand
jurors,
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
the
relief
request,
in
this
case
and
in
the
other
cases
where
that
question
is
raised.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
he
either
has
to
have
some
kind
of
evidence
from
which
he
can
make
a
preliminary
showing
to
that
effect
or
he
can't
make
the
showing.
the
law
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
our
--
our
view
is,
when
we
think
that
it's
--
it's
clear
that
the
law
makes
no
provision
for
interrogation
of
grand
jurors
on
voir
dire
and
in
the
cases
which
do
recognize
that
indictments
will
be
invalidated
by
a
virtue
of
corrupt
action
or
a
malicious
action
on
the
part
of
grand
jurors
are
dependant
as
most
situation
such
as
that
upon
the
defendant
being
in
a
position
to
come
forward
and
make
a
demonstration
that
that
was
the
case.
there's
no
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
that's
--
well,
that's
what
they
wanted
to
do
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
your
honor
that's
--
we
think
that's
the
only
remedy
they
have.
the
law
does
not
give
them
any
other
remedy
other
--
because
of
the
nature
of
the
grand
jury.
they
have
a
protection
at
trial,
it
isn't
as
if
they're
left
to
the
wolves.
they
have
a
trial
coming
up.
they
have
a
trial
coming
up
before
petit
jurors.
at
that
time,
they
will
be
allowed
to
make
a
detailed
exploration
into
the
actual
bias
of
particular
petit
jurors
and
after
all,
it
is
the
petit
jury
that
is
going
to
render
the
verdict
as
to
whether
there
is
guilt
or
innocence.
the
grand
jury
has
not
done
that.
it
doesn't
--
that's
not
the
function
of
the
grand
jury.
all
the
grand
jury
says
is,
“this
man
will
be
put
to
trial”,
that's
all.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
i
am
--
he
has
his
(inaudible)
defenses
that
he
can
--
i
mean
like
any
other
defenses
that
he
can
prove
they've
got
the
wrong
man.
he
can
prove
an
alibi
that
it
was
somebody
else
who
refused
to
answer
these
questions.
i
mean
undoubtedly,
if
he
--
if
he
was
there
--
if
he
was
--
and
if
he
did
refuse
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
not
your
honor
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
if
he
isn't
guilty
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
he
has
a
jury
trial.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
mean
it
may
well
be
and
i
think
it
frequently
is
in
these
cases
that
the
issues
are
fairly
--
and
certainly
the
factual
issues
of
fairly
cutting
drive,
the
defendant
who
subpoenaed,
he
appeared
he
refused
to
answer
questions.
the
only
thing
left
really,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
whether
or
not
he
made
legal
objections
which
he's
entitled
to
make.
if
he
did
those
things
and
if
he
didn't
make
proper
legal
objections,
he
has
violated
the
statute.
he
has
the
same
defense
that
anybody
else
has
in
any
kind
of
a
criminal
case.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
saw
fit
to
observe
as
it
rightly
might
that
not
only
did
this
petitioner
refused
to
answer
certain
questions
for
which
he
was
indicted.
but
his
attitude
before
the
subcommittee
was
abusive,
insulting,
and
contemptuous
of
the
committee
and
its
members.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
he
was
indicted
for
refusing
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course,
that
is
relevant,
your
honor
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
the
willfulness
or
the
refusal
to
answer
in
this
case.
his
--
his
attitude
and
his
remarks
to
the
committee
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
basis
upon
which
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
--
those
comments,
your
honor,
about
the
court
of
appeals
are
based
on
the
record
of
his
testimony
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
a
conclusion,
your
honor,
of
the
court
of
appeals
based
upon
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
from
the
record
at
the
hearing
which
was
offered
at
the
trial.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
they
--
they
have
direct
quotes
from
the
record,
your
honor,
that
he
made,
which
is
in
his
testimony,
and
the
court
puts
it
in
quotation
marks,
the
court
of
appeals
at
page
232.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
232,
yes
sir.
the
court,
after
making
the
statement
which
i
have
just
adverted
to
said
that
he
accused
the
committee
of
using
paid
liars
with
which
to
frame
witnesses,
then,
“i
did
not
know
what
paid
liars
and
forgers
that
you
may
have.”
“i
do
not
know
what
paid
liar
you
have
here
to
do
a
(inaudible)
job
on
me.”
“i
haven't
had
the
opportunity
to
vote
myself
at
$10,000
raise,”
and
a
few
others,
your
honor.
they're
all
in
the
record
of
the
transcript
of
the
hearings
which
is
in
evidence.
now,
in
view
of
the
assertions
which
is
the
principal
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
the
dominant
purpose
of
this
inquiry
and
of
calling
this
petitioner
before
the
committee
was
exposure
for
the
sake
of
exposure,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
go
back
and
advert
to
a
number
of
other
facts
which
occurred
prior
to
the
petitioner's
appearance
before
the
committee.
the
committee
--
the
testimony
in
the
case
shows
that
this
committee
had
been
engaged
intermittently
from
august
1949
to
february
1955
when
petitioner
appeared
in
investigating
communist
party
activities
within
the
united
electrical
workers
union.
the
committee
received
testimony
in
1951
from
an
individual
by
a
name
of
dekovich
(ph)
who
had
been
a
long
time
president
of
the
ue
and
a
former
communist
that
the
communist
party
infiltrated
the
ue.
mr.
dekovich
(ph)
had
testified
before
the
committee
that
it's
important
officials,
that
is
the
ue
where
99.9%
pure
communist
party
members.
in
july
1953,
one
jack
davis
had
testified
before
the
committee
that
all
organizers
for
the
ue
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
davis
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
had
been
a
ue
organizer.
before
this
petitioner
was
subpoenaed
before
the
committee,
the
committee
had
information
that
he
was
a
vice
president
of
the
international
and
was
a
president
of
district
9.
now,
on
february
9,
the
committee
announced
--
february
9,
1955,
this
the
period
which
is
involved,
the
committee
announced
that
hearings
would
begin
in
fort
wayne
on
february
21.
there
was
a
news
account
which
appeared
on
that
same
day
or
the
next
day
which
mentioned
the
petitioner
as
a
prospective
witness.
on
february
10,
the
next
day,
following
the
announcement
of
the
fort
wayne
hearings,
congressman
walters
received
an
abusive
telegram
from
the
petitioner,
protesting
the
hearings
in
view
of
the
nlrb
elections
which
were
scheduled
at
the
magnavox
plant
for
february
24.
now,
four
days
later,
on
february
14,
a
mr.
goldstein,
who
was
a
washington
representative
for
the
ue
requested
an
interview
with
congressman
walters
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
a
continuance
of
the
hearings.
a
transcript
of
the
interview
between
mr.
goldstein
and
congressman
walters
is
in
the
record
and
is
set
forth
at
pages
76
to
80.
now,
on
the
occasion
of
this
interview,
mr.
goldstein
said
that
he
had
asked
for
this
interview
to
request
the
postponement
and
to
find
out,
this
is
on
page
77,
whether
you
and
the
committee
were
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
election
was
scheduled
for
the
24th
and
chairman
walter
said
“not
until
we
received
an
insulting
telegram.
after
i
received
that
telegram,
then
i
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
was
an
election
being
held.
we
had
previously
absolutely
no
knowledge
of
it,
and
the
only
reason
we
decided
on
this
hearing
there
was
because
these
people
are
there.”
so
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
conclusively
shows
that
the
committee
when
it
decided
and
announced
the
fort
wayne
hearings
had
no
knowledge
of
the
magnavox
elections.
now
they
also
relying
on
a
--
on
a
newspaper,
petitioner
relies
on
a
newspaper
account
in
which
there
was
a
reference
made
to
union-busting.
the
writer
of
that
account
testified
at
the
trial
and
was
present
at
this
conference
which
was
recorded
and
is
part
of
the
record
between
congressman
walter
and
mr.
goldstein.
at
that
--
to
go
back
that
conference
for
a
minute,
mr.
goldstein
and
this
is
also
on
page
77
said,
“let
me
say
this.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
this
visit
of
mine
was
simply
for
the
purpose
of
asking
the
question
that
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
whether
or
not
you
were
aware
of
that
election,
and
if
not,
to
tell
you
about
it,
and
to
say
this:
that
it
looked
to
us
and
it
would
look
to
a
lot
of
people
as
though
the
coincidence
of
the
two
was
more
than
a
coincidence.
now,
i
am
saying
that
without
accusing
you.”
chairman
walter,
“i
do
not
care
if
you
accuse
me
or
not.
i
do
not
care
what
you
have
to
say
about
me.
but
this
telegram
said
very
definitely
that
this
was
a
case
of
union-busting.
now,
there
is
no
one
on
this
committee
interested
in
busting
unions.
all
of
us
have
very
established
records,
but
all
of
us
are
interested
in
seeing
your
union
go
out
of
business,
because
we
do
not
believe
it
is
good
for
the
united
states.”
and
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
that
statement,
that
congressman
walters
made
in
retort
to
the
suggestion
--
suggested
accusation
made
by
mr.
goldstein
had
this
to
say,
and
this
at
page
25
of
our
brief.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“it
can
be
gleaned
that
mr.
walter
showed
some
displeasure
which,
under
the
circumstances,
and
having
in
mind
the
abusive
and
insulting
telegram,
can
be
understood
and
as
readily
be
excused.
congressmen
are
more
fortunate
than
judges
in
at
least
this
respect,
that
when
attacked
unjustly,
they
are
at
liberty
to
defend
themselves,
and
to
express
themselves
forcefully
and
vigorously.”
now,
later
on
--
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
mr.
goldstein
at
this
interview,
which
was
recorded
and
really
took
the
form
of
a
committee
hearing,
refused
to
--
to
be
sworn
to
--
to
state
under
oath
that
he
knew
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
was
going
to
be
an
election
held
on
the
date
indicated
and
that
it
was
that
reason
that
he
requested
in
the
--
the
continuance
of
the
hearing.
since
he
refused
to
make
a
part
of
assertion
on
that
score,
this
particular
meeting
adjourned
without
any
action
being
taken
on
the
request
for
a
continuance.
a
few
days
later,
there
was
a
telegram
sent
from
petitioner's
counsel
to
these
--
the
committee
requesting
a
continuance,
that
was
at
first
denied,
but
later
on,
mr.
tavenner's
testimony
shows
that
when
he
checked
into
the
question
of
the
hearing
at
magnavox
and
found
out
the
hearing
was
coming
up,
he
got
in
touched
with
mr.
walter
and
there
was
a
continuance
granted.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
had
pointed
out
certain
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
which
showed
that
the
committee,
the
time
the
hearings
were
set
for
fort
wayne,
had
no
knowledge
of
the
scheduled
election
at
(inaudible),
but
that
a
continuance
was
granted
when
a
responsible
request
for
such
a
continuance
was
made
by
petitioner's
then
counsel.
the
hearings
were
continued
from
february
21
to
february
28,
which
was
the
time
period
requested,
i
think
they
requested
at
least
a
week,
and
petitioner
appeared
on
the
latter
date,
february
28,
in
washington.
he
testified
extensively
on
february
28
and
march
1.
he
answered
a
large
number
of
questions
concerning
his
union
offices,
his
military
service,
his
occupations
and
employment,
but
he
refused
to
answer
questions
concerning
activities
in
the
communist
party
or
connected
with
the
communist
party
challenging
the
right
of
the
committee
to
ask
such
questions
which
he
alleged
were
in
violation
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir,
he
did.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it's
set
forth
in
the
record
at
page
201.
the
prepared
statement
was
submitted
at
the
outset
of
the
hearings.
the
petitioner
was
not
the
first
witness,
he
was
the
third
witness.
the
first
three
witnesses,
all
were
represented
by
the
same
counsel
and
the
written
statement,
which
is
in
the
record,
was
submitted
on
behalf
of
those
first
three
witnesses
including
the
petitioner
and
was
submitted
to
the
committee
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearings.
the
statement
challenges
the
lack
of
a
legislative
purpose.
it
alleges
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
was
to
force
ue
out
of
business.
it
alleges
that
the
purpose
of
breaking
a
union
is
not
authorized
by
public
law
601
and
that
even
if
such
a
purpose
were
authorized,
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment
and
that
the
basic
resolution
is
unconstitutional
and
the
disclosure
of
his
political
beliefs
or
their
political
beliefs
would
violate
their
first
--
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
first
--
the
first
point
in
this
written
statement
is
that
the
committee
is
not
engaged
in
a
legislative
investigation
for
a
bona
fide
legislative
purpose.
and
then,
it
goes
on
to
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that
the
--
the
general
point
they
raised
as
to
the
charges
of
exposure
and
union
busting
would
be
barely
in
that
general
objection
made
in
the
written
statements,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
pertinency
objection.
no,
sir.
we
--
we
think
it's
clear
that
at
no
time
has
petitioner
raised
an
objection
as
to
pertinency.
i
think
in
his
brief,
now
he
does,
but
he
didn't
do
it
before
--
before
the
committee.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
on
--
on
the
question
of
exposure,
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
only
--
only
on
the
allegations
which
they
make,
and
which
they
have
made
continuously
concerning
the
fact
that
the
committee
was
engaged
in
union
busting.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and,
it
was
--
the
discussion
at
the
interview
with
mr.
goldstein,
who
was
a
washington
representative
of
the
petitioner's
union,
coupled
with
a
telegram
was
what
gave
rise
to
congressman
walter's
retort
to
the
provocations
of
the
telegram
and
to
the
accusations
of
mr.
goldstein
at
that
interview,
but
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
the
exposure
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
argument,
generally,
goes
beyond
that.
they
go
to
newspaper
clippings
which
quote
“members
of
the
committee”
and
to
other
sources
which
purport
to
quote
“members
of
the
committee”
on
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
--
not
on
the
question
of
exposure,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
on
the
exposure
argument,
we
rely
on
this
court's
decisions
in
watkins
and
barenblatt
in
which
the
--
substantially
the
same
contentions
were
made
based
on
similar
evidence,
statements
of
members
of
the
committee
and
things
of
that
sort,
which
they
urge
and
show
that
the
committee
was
engaged
in
a
pattern
of
exposure.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
particular
statement,
your
honor,
was
made,
we
think,
in
--
as
a
result
of
the
provocation
of
the
telegram
and
of
the
accusation
made
by
mr.
goldstein
at
the
u
--
at
this
interview
which
was
recorded,
the
statement
about
putting
the
union
out
of
business.
moreover,
the
--
we
think
that,
under
the
court's
decisions
in
watkins
and
barenblatt
where
the
court
said
that
it
would
not
look
into
--
it
could
not
inquire
into
the
motives
of
members
of
the
committee
where
it
appeared
from
the
record
that
a
legislative
purpose
of
the
congress
was
being
served.
in
--
in
the
barenblatt
case
the
court
said
in
part
that
so
long
as
congress
acts
in
pursuance
of
a
--
of
its
constitutional
power,
the
judiciary
lacks
authority
to
intervene
on
the
basis
of
the
motives
which
spur
the
exercise
of
that
power.
a
similar
statement
was
made
in
watkins
where
the
court
there
said
that
their
motives
alone
would
not
vitiate
an
investigation
which
had
been
instituted
by
a
house
of
congress
if
that
assembly's
legislative
purpose
is
being
served.
now,
in
this
case,
we
think
it
clear
that
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
committee
here
was,
at
the
time
of
these
hearings,
engaged
in
a
le
--
in
a
proper
legislative
purpose.
the
district
court
made
such
a
finding
and
that
finding
is
quoted
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
the
record
at
page
229.
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
similar
finding
that
there
was
a
dominant
legislative
purpose
in
these
hearings
and
of
course,
we
think
that
--
that
those
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
lower
courts
are
amply
supported
by
the
record.
at
the
outset
of
the
hearings
at
which
petitioner
testified,
the
committee
chairman
announced
and
his
part
of
his
opening
statement,
which
is
set
forth
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
he
stated
there
will
be
considered
at
this
hearing
testimony
relating
to
communist
party
activities
within
the
field
of
labor.
the
methods
used
by
the
communist
party
to
infiltrate
labor
organizations
and
the
dissemination
of
communist
party
propaganda.
similar
statements
were
made
during
the
course
of
various
colloquy
with
the
witness
during
his
interrogation
and
in
connection
with
questions
which
he
refused
to
answer
made
by
members
of
the
committee,
urging
him
to
answer
and
such
statements
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
10
and
12,
reiterating
the
interest
of
the
committee
in
ascertaining
the
extent
of
communist
infiltration
of
labor
unions
and
his
knowledge
concerning
such
activity
which
the
committee
was
seeking
him
to
testify.
additionally,
the
--
there
is
in
the
record
also
the
committee's
1955
annual
report
which
begins
in
the
record
at
page
126
--
or
--
or
128,
rather
and
in
that
annual
report,
the
committee
refers
to
the
fort
wayne
hearings,
the
hearings
at
which
this
petitioner
testified.
they
--
the
committee
reports
that
documented
proof
that
a
communist
dominated
union
siphons
off
worker's
dues
for
communist
purposes
was
produced
in
the
course
of
committee
investigations
and
hearings
on
district
9
of
the
ue.
committee
also
reported,
and
this
statement
appears
on
page
131,
that
these
documents
which
had
been
introduced
contained
incontrovertible
evidence
of
the
leadership
of
district
9
had
diverted
workers'
union
dues
to
--
to
the
support
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
is
after
the
hearings,
your
honor.
this
is
for
the
year
1955
at
which
the
committee
was
reporting
to
the
congress
in
its
annual
report
concerning
its
activities
during
the
year,
and
that
report
makes
reference
to
these
hearings
and
the
findings
and
conclusions
that
the
committee
was
making
as
a
result,
in
part,
of
the
testimony
adduced
at
these
hearings.
the
report
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
committee's
report,
your
honor,
and
the
legislative
recommendations
which
the
committee
also
makes
in
that
report
is
support
for
the
contention
that
the
committee
had
a
proper
legislative
purpose
at
the
time
of
the
--
of
the
hearings
here.
there
is
also
in
the
record
the
--
i
think
it's
exhibit
7,
the
committee's
report
for
the
year
1954
which
is
the
preceding
year
and
which
refers
to
the
committee's
investigation
of
communist
activity
in
the
labor
field,
plus
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i'll
try
to
get
in
a
minute,
your
honor.
now,
additionally,
the
court--
or
the
congress
has,
from
time-to-time,
as
the
court
knows,
passed
legislation
which
has
dealt
with
the
problem
of
communist
activity
in
the
labor
field.
the
communist
control
act
of
1954,
which
was
a
year
preceding
these
hearings,
was
passed
and
which
added
to
the
two
categories
of
communist
organizations
established
in
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
added
the
third
category
of
a
communist-infiltrated
organization
which
is
defined
in
the
statute
as
an
organization
do
--
as
a
labor
organization
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
communist
party.
the
--
the
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
which
required
affidavits
of
non-communist
union
officers,
shows
the
interest
of
congress
continuously
in
the
problem
of
communist
activity
in
the
labor
field,
and
a
number
of
other
statutes,
the
recent
repeal
of
section
9
(h)
and
the
enactment
of
the
new
statute
which
prohibits
members
of
the
communist
party
from
holding
union
offices
contemporaneous
with
being
members
of
the
party.
now,
in
just
the
--
i
think
that
pretty
well
sums
up
our
contentions
on
the
legal
points
made
in
this
case.
your
honor,
there's
a
colloquy
concerning
the
admissibility
of
exhibit
7
which
begins
at
page
15
of
the
record
and
two
extracts
are
quoted
by
the
court
at
page
20
and
21.
that
--
those
extracts
or
one
of
them
deals
with
the
communist
party
colonization
program.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
was
substituted
as
a
--
as
a
package
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
at
about
that
same
time,
there
was
enacted
the
statute
which
is
really
in
two
parts.
the
first
part
of
the
statute
prohibits
individuals
convicted
of
certain
--
certain
criminal
offenses
from
--
within
the
preceding
five
years,
i
think,
from
holding
jobs
in
certain
union
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
union
offices
unless,
i
think,
there's
a
provision
whereby
the
parole
board
can
certify
that
they
have
been
rehabilitated
and,
therefore,
can
hold
the
job.
there's
a
second
part
to
that
which
prohibits
members
of
the
communist
party
from
holding
certain
high
level
union
offices.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it's
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it's
--
it's
a
criminal
offense
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
for
a
communist
party
member
to
hold
such
a
union
position.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
on
his
part.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
understand.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
isn't
tied
up
with
any
nlrb
rights,
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
it
is
strictly
a
criminal
offense
as
i
recall
it
and
i
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
can
get
the
citation
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
--
but
it's
a
criminal
offense
for
a
member
of
the
party
to
hold
such
a
union
position.
there
is
a
case
which
has
been
initiated
under
that
statute
in
california
against,
i
think,
archie
brown.
that
case
has
not
yet
come
to
trial.
i
think
they've
had
preliminary
motions
on
constitutional
arguments
and
so
forth,
but
that
is
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
is
the
first
case
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct,
sir.
