justice

o.
douglas
yes,
but
what
page?
justice
william
o.
douglas
89?
justice
william
o.
douglas
89.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
i've
found
the
first
(voice

--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
i
see
it
now,
thank
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
with
your
answer
to
justice
--
i
don't
want
to
beset
you
further
than
you
are
already
beset.
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
seemed
to
suggest
that
the
problem
was
to
what
extent
a
court
will
interfere
with
congressional
committees.
i
didn't
think
that
was
in
the
--
these
case
or
--
any
of
the
cases
at
all,
because
simply
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
no
court
--
as
i
see
it
with
issue
of
an
injunction
that
say,
“you
shall
not
do
this”.
isn't
our
problem
that
the
extent
of
which
the
federal
courts
will
allow
themselves
to
become
implicated
in
unfair
proceedings
before
congressional
committees
and
send
people
to
jail
who
--
that
the
committee
wants
us
to
put
in
jail
or
wants
the
district
courts
with
juries
to
put
in
jail.
justice
william
o.
douglas
isn't
it
--
isn't
the
question
of
the
extent
of
which
the
federal
judiciary
should
become
implicated
in
--
in
these
congressional
investigations,
it
seemed
--
assuming
arguendo
that
that
stepped
over
the
bounds
of
fairness.
it
was
--
it
was
the
idea
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
expressed
in
his
separate
opinion
in
the
wilkinson
case
or
some
case.
i
forgot
the
precise
name
of
it.
it's
been
running
up
a
common
thread
throughout
a
lot
of
our
opinions.
and
while
we
haven't
squarely
faced
up
to
it,
maybe
this
is
the
case
that
will
cause
us
to
face
up
to
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
there
maybe
two
levels.
one
is
where
the
--
the
congressional
inquiries
beyond
the
scope
of
the
committee's
authority.
and
i'm
assuming
that
it
is
within
the
scope
that
justice
harlan
does
that
--
that
it
is
relevant.
the
extent
of
which
--
nevertheless
courts
should
go
or
the
--
should
not
go
in
lending
their
prestige,
their
imprimatur,
their
help
to
putting
people
in
--
in
prison
backing
up
what
maybe
we
assume
arguendo
is
grossly
unfair
congressional
procedures.
justice
william
o.
douglas
no.
but
that
--
but
that's
not
the
question
could
we
--
no
court
is
interfering.
congress
has
its
own
method
of
holding
people
in
contempt.
justice
william
o.
douglas
congress
can
put
--
could
put
this
man
in
prison
for
--
for
failing
to
answer.
we're
not
concerned
with
that.
we're
concerned
with
the
issue
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
there
is
an
essential
difference
because
the
power
of
congress
to
--
to
hold
for
contempt
expires
at
the
end
of
the
--
of
the
congress.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
here
is
--
this
one
is
for
10
years.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
that's
--
that's
something
that's
never
been
adjudicated.
justice
william
o.
douglas
by
a
man
who
is
committed
by
the
--
by
the
senate
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
i
mean
i'm
not
sure
that
you
could
say
that's
an
adjudication.
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
maybe
some
justiciable
question,
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
one
thing
for
congress
to
hold
the
man
for
the
--
that
congress
for
failing
to
answer.
another
thing,
the
courts
to
say
off
you
go
to
prison
for
10
years.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
would
be
a
--
it
would
be
a
serious
limitation
on
the
powers
of
prosecutors
to
get
indictments
for
offenses
of
this
kind.
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
congress
legislate
as
to
who
the
new
york
times
or
tribune
or
washington
post
could
employ?
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
they
prescribe
standards
for
a
newspaper
reporter?
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
they
say
that
they
would
have
to
pass
a
certain
loyalty
test
to
be
given
by
the
congress
before
they
could
report
for
the
newspaper?
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
where
is
this
in
the
legislative
field
of
congress?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
was
--
this
was
an
investigation
into
agencies
off
mass
communication,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
was
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
into
the
press.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
for
that
reason,
they
could
go
through
all
the
churches
too.
take
in
every
minister
and
all
the
sermons,
what
he
says
and
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know
but
we're
in
the
field
of
ideological
meaning,
ideological
matter.
we're
in
the
field
of
what
a
man
working
for
a
newspaper
or
a
minister
in
a
pulpit,
but
he
thinks
what
his
political
philosophy
is,
what
his
social
philosophy
is,
we're
in
that
area.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course
a
person
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
commits
a
crime
the
fact
that
he
is
the
editor
of
new
york
times
doesn't
make
him
immune.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about.
there's
no
criminal
conduct
being
investigated
here,
isn't
it?
