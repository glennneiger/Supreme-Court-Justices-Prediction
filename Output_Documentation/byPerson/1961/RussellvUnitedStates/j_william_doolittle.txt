mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
raised
a
substantial
number
of
issues
for
consideration
by
the
court,
some
of
them
presenting
very
broad
constitutional
questions.
however,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
all
of
these
questions
and
particularly
the
constitutional
questions
in
order
to
decide
this
case
completely.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
on
19
counts;
not
all
of
the
questions
that
he
raises
go
to
all
of
the
counts
since
he
was
given
a
general
sentence
and
a
fine
at
all
19
counts
it
was
less
than
the
maximum
authorized
by
2
u.s.c.
192,
for
any
one
count,
the
judgment
below
must
be
affirmed
if
any
one
of
the
counts
is
valid.
under
the
circumstances
of
course,
it
is
only
proper
that
we
consider
or
at
least
that
we
begin
our
consideration
with
the
count
or
counts
as
to
which
the
petitioner
raises
the
fewest
questions.
therefore,
while
the
government
does
contend
that
all
of
the
counts
are
valid
but
except
for
counts
3,
4
and
5,
as
to
which
we
agree
that
the
questions
were
in
fact
answered,
i
should
like
to
focus
at
the
outset
of
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
should
like
to
focus
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
on
count
7.
mr.
whitman
had
testified
that
he
was
connected
with
a
communist
unit
in
the
new
york
herald
tribune
and
that
appears
on
page
1742
to
43
of
the
hearings
and
he
declined
to
name,
he
then
declined
to
name
any
persons
who
were
members
of
that
unit
when
he
was
a
member
and
that
is
the
basis
for
count
6.
then
he
was
asked
the
question
on
which
count
7
is
based.
?now
the
members
that
you're
associated
with
in
the
cell,
do
you
know
whether
any
of
them
are
still
employed
by
the
herald
tribune??
now,
let
us
first
put
to
one
side
to
the
moment,
the
questions
that
that
--
the
issues
that
that
question
does
not
raise?
first,
that
question
does
not
involve
petitioners
and
the
amicus
contention
that
the
first
amendment
protects
a
witness
from
having
to
disclose
the
names
of
persons
with
whom
he
has
associated.
the
question
called
for
no
names
and
considering
the
size
of
the
staff
of
the
new
york
herald
tribune
which
petitioner
indicated
in
the
hearings
was
a
couple
of,
a
couple
of
hundred
perhaps
exclusive
of
mechanical,
that's
at
1742
of
the
hearings
and
further
since
he
had
disclosed
to
the
committee
any
of
the
names
of
the
people
in
the
unit
he
had
been
with
in
1948,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
an
answer
to
the
question
would
have
identified
the
names
of
any
of
petitioner's
former
associates.
secondly,
the
question
does
not
involve
the
problem
of
remoteness
in
time
that
that
petitioner
has
argued.
it
concerned
the
persons
employed
by
the
new
york
herald
tribune
at
the
time
of
the
hearings,
that
is
in
1956.
now,
of
course
it
was
linked
with
the
petitioner
since
his
last
activities
had
been
in
that
cell
in
1948,
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
in
connection
with
the
petitioner's
argument
on
this
point
of
remoteness
that
while
there
may
have
been
what
he
describes
to
be
a
high,
a
watermark
in
1950,
that
this
makes
it
all
the
more
important
for
the
committees
investigating
this
problem
to
able
to
look
at
information
prior
to
1950
because
this
watermark
will
also
determine
the
time
when
by
and
large
it
became
more
and
more
difficult
to
find
anything
out
of
the
party's
activities
and
only
by
developing
the
background
prior
to
the
time
that
the
party,
excuse
me,
what
more
and
more
underground
that
the
committees
were
able
to
develop
any
information
at
all.
thirdly,
assuming
that
the
question
under
inquiry
was
communist
infiltration
into
the
press
and
i
shall
go
into
that
question
in
a
moment,
this
question
clearly
does
not
involve
a
pertinency
problem
since
it
was
plainly
pertinent
on
its
face
to
an
inquiry
and
to
communist
infiltration
in
mass
communications
media
and
more
particularly
in
the
press.
the
answer
to
the
question
would
have
contributed
importantly
to
the
subcommittee's
knowledge
as
to
the
extent
of
communist
infiltration
into
the
newspapers
in
new
york
and
might
well
provide
a
foundation
for
asking
other
questions
that
that
petitioner
may
well
have
been
willing
to
answer.
for
example,
if
his
answer
had
been
in
the
affirmative,
there
were
still
some
people
in
the
new
york
herald
tribune
who
had
been
a
member
of
that
cell;
questions
such
as
how
many
of
them,
what
their
functions
had
been
in
the
party,
questions
such
as
that
might
have
been
asked
that
is
i
say
petitioner
may
have
been
willing
to
answer
and
that
the
amicus
for
example
at
page
12
its
brief
suggest
what
probably
be
appropriate
since
the
committee
did
have
a
valid
interest
in
determining
the
extent
or
at
least
the
numerical
extent
of
infiltration
into
mass
media.
now,
petitioner
does
raise
a
number
of
other
contentions
that
if
sustained
by
this
court
will
invalidate
the
petitioner's
conviction
on
all
counts
including
count
7
which
i
have
been
focusing
and
i'd
like
to
take
up
these
questions.
broadly
speaking,
they
relate
the
definition
of
the
subject
under
inquiry,
the
pertinence
of
individual
questions
to
that
subject,
the
authority
of
the
subcommittee
to
conduct
the
inquiry,
the
extent
to
which
petitioner
was
informed
of
these
matters
and
certain
questions
relating
to
the
form
of
the
indictment.
i
shall
discuss
each
of
these
in
turn
and
then
with
anytime
remaining,
i
shall
attempt
to
cover
the
points
that
go
to
the
other
counts
in
the
indictment.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
hope
i
can
get
to
that
point
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well
that's
implicit
--
implicit
basically
in
the
first
amendment
contention.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well
i'm
--
what
i'm
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
what
i'm
going
to
do
mr.
justice
is
to
take
up
the
points
that
must
be
reached
in
order
to
decide
this
case.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
in
the
context
in
which
it
has
been
raised,
we
submit
that
you
need
not
sir
because
the
first
amendment
point
that
he
makes
that
is
as
to
whether
or
not
the
individual
has
to
disclose
names
of
other
persons
are
not
raised
by
all
of
the
counts
in
the
indictment
and
i
am
taking
up
at
this
point,
one
of
the
counts
that
did
not
involve
that
point.
i
do
hope
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
not
in
the
context
in
which
he
has
raised
it,
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
black.
we
will
contend
as
i
will
spell
out
that
on
the
basis
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
balance
is
clearly
drawn
in
favor
of
the
witness'
having
to
answer
but
i
certainly
course
to
the
extent
of
that
as
necessarily
in
the
case
of
course.
i
submit
that
an
objective
reading
of
this
record
will
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
subject
under
inquiry
by
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee
at
the
hearings
at
which
petitioner
appeared.
the
subcommittee
had
for
some
11
months,
been
conducting
hearings
on
strategy
and
tactics
of
world
communism.
within
that
basic
framework
that
on
the
basis
of
testimony
given
by
one
winston
burdett
who
was
a
newspaper
man
and
broadcaster,
the
subcommittee
undertook
to
focus
more
particularly
on
communist
infiltration
into
news
media.
it
held
3
days
of
hearings
in
january
on
1956
at
which
18
witnesses
appeared;
17
of
whom
where
then
or
recently
have
been
employed
as
newsmen
and
other
of
whom
was
a
film
exhibitor.
at
the
outset
of
the
hearings
on
january
4th,
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
announced
that
the
hearings
about
to
commence
stemmed
from
burdett's
testimony.
that
the
investigation
of
communist
affiliations
that
resulted
from
that
testimony
disclosed,
?many
who
were
or
are
members
of
the
press?
and
that
?the
international
communist
conspiracy
has
as
one
of
its
primary
aims
the
influencing
of
public
opinion
thus
carrying
on
a
psychological
warfare
against
the
united
states
and
its
institutions
from
inside
by
methods
of
penetration.?
then
senator
hennings
said
in
a
statement
whose
primary
purpose
was
to
disavow
any
attack
on
the
free
press
to
that,
?the
committee
is
interested
in
the
extent
and
nature
of
so-called
communist
infiltration
if
such
exists
into
any
news
dispensing
agency.?
the
chairman
expressed
his
agreement
with
senator
hennings'
statement
in
its
entirety
and
also
disavowed
any
attack
on
the
free
press.
on
january
6th,
the
3rd
day
of
the
hearings
and
the
day
on
which
petitioner
appeared,
the
proceeding
is
opened
with
a
reading
of
a
telegram
from
a
new
york
newspaper
in
which
the
newspaper
stated
its
agreement
with
the
subcommittee's
efforts
to
uncover
communist
infiltration
wherever
found
and
the
chairman
responded
by
reaffirming
the
subcommittee's
purpose
to
follow
up
the
information
concerning
infiltration
of
persons
identified
as
communists
into
news
agencies.
in
a
course
of
some
remarks
by
senator
hennings
on
that
day
he
said,
?i
think
no
one
will
quarrel
with
nor
take
issue
with
the
fact
that
this
committee
has
the
right
to
inquire
into
all
efforts
or
indeed
all
consummations
of
efforts
of
the
communist
party
to
infiltrate
newspapers
or
other
media
of
communications?.
the
subcommittee
then
called
robert
shelton,
the
petitioner
in
number
9;
who
is
employed
as
a
copyreader
with
the
new
york
times.
shelton
was
questioned
primarily
on
whether
or
not
he
had
any
communist
affiliations
and
about
communist
infiltration
in
the
typographical
union.
the
next
witness
was
petitioner,
and
petitioner
concedes
that
he
was
present
at
the
beginning
of
the
session
that
day
incidentally.
by
and
large,
the
questioning
of
petitioner,
himself,
developed
the
character
and
duration
of
his
employment
by
various
newspapers,
by
tass
the
soviet
news
agency
and
by
various
communist
front
organizations,
the
nature
and
activities
of
the
communist
units
to
which
the
petitioner
has
been
exposed
and
more
particularly
of
the
newspaper
cells
of
the
communist
party
to
which
he
belonged
and
that
the
relationship
of
his
party
membership
to
his
employment
with
these
various
newspapers.
one
cannot
read
the
testimony
of
this
petitioner
and
that
of
the
other
witnesses
in
this
set
of
hearings
all
of
whom
were
in
the
communications
field
and
all
but
one
of
whom
were
newsmen
without
becoming
convinced
that
the
hearings
were
in
point
of
fact
concerned
with
precisely
what
the
chairman
announced
would
be
the
subject
under
the
inquiry,
the
strategy
and
tactics
of
the
communism
that's
reflected
in
communist
infiltration
into
news
media.
at
petitioner's
trial,
the
government
established
that
this
was
the
subject
under
inquiry
by
introducing
the
transcript
of
the
hearings
into
evidence.
in
addition,
the
subcommittee
counsel
testified
that,
?in
these
particular
hearings,
we
were
in
an
area
within
the
broad
area
of
tactics
and
strategy
within
the
narrower
area
of
infiltration
of
mass
communications,?
that's
at
page
31
of
the
joint
appendix
and
that
the
investigation
was,
?into
the
strategy
and
tactics
of
world
communism
of
which
this
mass
communications
was
an
offshoot
and
apportion,?
that's
on
page
37
of
the
joint
appendix.
now,
there
were
references
as
counsel
points
out
on
his
brief
in
the
testimony
of
the
subcommittee
counsel,
references
to
the
investigation
of
communist
activities
generally
but
it
is
clear
from
the
context
of
those
remarks
that
he
was
referring
to
the
basic
investigation
of
which
these
3-day
set
of
hearings
was
but
a
part.
and
similar
statements
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
are
plain
and
can
be
explained
in
the
same
way
where
the
rest
of
the
transcript
indicates
clearly
that
he
understood
the
subject
under
inquiry
to
be
what
i
have
said
that
it
is.
for
example,
at
page
34
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
said,
?you
were
indeed
though
inquiring
were
you
not
into
mass
communications
infiltration
by
communists??
and
at
page
37,
his
question
was
in
this
particular
investigation
in
mass
communications
and
generally
in
the
tactics
and
strategy
of
world
communism,
was
that
commenced
before
or
after
the
passage
of
the
rule
in
1955?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
we
do,
your
honor
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
contrary
to
the
representations
that
petitioner
has
made
in
this
appendix
to
his
brief,
the
court
of
appeals
did
identify
and
affirm
the
subject
under
inquiry
to
be
precisely
as
i
have
described
it.
the
court
by
specific
reference
and
that's
at
page
2
of
the
printed
record
found
the
subject
under
inquiry
to
be
the
same
as
it
had
found
in
the
shelton
case.
in
the
shelton
case,
its
statement
was,
?the
broad
subject
matter
of
communist
party
infiltration
and
subversion
and
narrower
subject
of
efforts
to
influence
american
public
opinion
and
the
specific
effort
to
use
the
press
to
implement
these
objectives;
that's
at
page
238
in
the
shelton
record.
and
then
in
its
opinion
in
this
case,
the
court
below
went
on
to
find
that
certain
other
questions
including
count
7
which
i
have
been
discussing,
?were
clearly
pertinent
to
an
investigation
of
subversive
activities
as
manifested
by
the
organization
of
members
of
the
press
into
communist
party
cells
in
the
period
following
world
war
ii?
and
that's
at
page
3
of
the
record.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
for
any
doubt
as
to
the
subject
that
the
subcommittee
had
under
inquiry
when
it
was
questioning
petitioner
nor
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
is
there
any
possible
doubt
as
to
the
pertinency
of
some
at
least
of
the
questions
petitioner
refused
to
answer,
the
first
eight
of
which
were
pertinent
on
their
face
to
the
subject
of
communist
infiltration
into
news
media.
now,
petitioner
contends
that
even
if
the
subject
under
inquiry
was
as
i
have
described
it,
he
was
not
apprised
to
the
subject
or
on
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
to
that
subject.
in
the
first
place,
this
contention
is
not
open
to
the
petitioner
since
he
did
not
raise
the
issue
of
pertinency
or
the
scope
of
the
subject
under
inquiry
at
the
hearing
when
the
subcommittee
could
have
corrected
any
deficiency
in
this
regard
that
might
have
existed.
the
general
objection
that
the
petitioner
made
to
the
authority
of
the
subcommittee
appears
at
page
1733
of
the
hearings
and
we
submit
that
it
is
significantly
less
precise
then
the
one
that
was
involved
in
the
barenblatt
case
in
which
this
court
held
was
insufficient
to
raise
the
question
of
pertinency.
all
the
statement
that
petitioner
had
in
the
hearings
did
was
to
raise
in
a
general
way
the
first
amendment
point
that
counsel
has
argued
here
and
that
is
that
he
was
not
obligated
by
the
first
amendment
to
answer
questions
concerning
other
persons,
but
the
--
as
an
objection
to
pertinency,
we
feel
certain
that
under
both
barenblatt
and
deutch
it
was
completely
inadequate
to
express
that
point.
in
any
event,
however,
petitioner
was
plainly
apprised
both
of
the
nature
of
the
subject
matter
and
of
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
to
subject
matter.
he
was
present
at
the
start
of
the
hearings
on
january
6th
when
he
heard
both
the
chairman
and
senator
hennings
to
make
statements
i've
already
referred
to
identifying
the
subject
under
inquiry
as
communist
infiltration
into
news
media.
he
heard
the
witness
ahead
of
him,
a
newsman,
questioned
on
this
subject.
his
own
prepared
statement,
the
one
i
referred
to
at
page
1733
in
the
hearings
reflects
his
understanding
that
infiltration
of
the
press
was
the
subject
under
inquiry.
he
ascribed
the
investigation
as
being,
?with
reference
to
the
beliefs,
associations
and
activities
of
individuals,
who
are
or
have
been
connected
with
newspapers.
here
as
in
barenblatt
and
--
and
precisely
the
same
reasons
as
in
barenblatt,
the
witness
was
plainly
aware
of
the
subject
under
inquiry
and
since
a
number
of
the
questions
including
that
involved
in
count
7,
were
pertinent
on
their
face
to
the
question
of
communist
infiltration
into
the
press,
petitioner
must
be
held
to
have
been
aware
of
their
pertinency.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
will
recall
that
on
thursday,
i
was
analyzing
this
case
in
terms
of
a
single
count,
count
7
which
arose
out
of
petitioner's
refusal
to
answer
a
question
as
to
whether
any
of
the
members
of
the
new
york
herald
tribune
cell
of
the
communist
party
to
which
he
had
belonged
until
1948
were
still
employed
by
that
newspaper.
i
chose
that
count
because
it
does
not
involve
petitioner's
main
first
amendment
contention
that
he
could
not
be
forced
to
disclose
names
because
it
does
not
present
the
problem
of
temporal
remoteness
that
the
petitioner
raises
and
because
it
does
not
present
any
problem
of
pertinency
to
an
inquiry
into
communist
infiltration
of
news
media.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir,
number
7.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
number
7
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
it
appears
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
5,
that's
the
large
blue
document.
now,
on
arguing
that,
the
government
had
fully
proved
the
subject
under
inquiry,
i
described
to
the
court
the
nature
of
the
proceedings,
the
remarks
of
the
chairman
and
of
senator
hennings
and
of
the
character
of
the
questioning
of
petitioner
all
of
which
establish
beyond
doubt
that
the
subject
was
communist
infiltration
into
news
media.
incidentally,
i
should
like
to
observe
in
this
connection
that
most
of
what
i
said
is
fully
applicable
to
the
shelton
and
price
cases
which
arose
out
of
the
very
same
hearings.
i
also
argued
that
while
the
petitioner
did
not
raise
any
objections
either
in
the
area
of
the
subject
matter
or
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
that
he
was
fully
apprised
to
both.
now,
in
order
to
be
certain
that
i
reach
the
matter,
i
should
like
now
to
cover
the
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
black
on
thursday,
and
that
is,
the
balance
that
is
to
be
struck
under
the
first
amendment
and
under
the
barenblatt
case
between
the
governmental
interest
and
the
private
interest
that
is
involved.
in
cases
such
as
these,
where
there
is
an
undoubted
interference
with
the
individual's
right
to
be
left
alone,
i
shall
continue
to
limit
my
primary
focus
on
count
7
since
an
affirmance
on
that
count
alone
will
sustain
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
trial
court.
the
importance
of
the
governmental
interest
involved
in
the
conduct
of
investigations
of
communist
activity
in
this
country
has
been
fully
explained
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
barenblatt
case.
that
interest
was
there
held
to
be
paramount
even
with
respect
to
lawful
activities
for,
as
the
court
pointed
out,
of
necessity
the
investigating
process,
investigatory
process
must
proceed
step
by
step.
that
governmental
interest
was
there
held
to
be
paramount
even
with
respect
to
an
area
as
sensitive
as
education.
an
educational
institution,
said
to
the
court,
is
not
a
constitutional
sanctuary
from
inquiry
and
surely,
the
pressroom
is
not
in
a
more
favored
room
--
it
is
not
in
a
more
favored
position
than
the
classroom.
that
governmental
interest
was
there
held
to
be
paramount
even
with
respect
to
so-called
associational
activities.
in
short,
the
governmental
interest
here
is
in
no
sense
less
compelling
than
it
was
in
the
barenblatt
case.
now
of
course,
it
is
relevant
in
balancing
the
competing
public
and
private
interests
that
are
involved
in
case
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
i
havren't
completed
stating
the
balances.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
sir
and
i
should
now
like
to
focus
more
particularly
on
the
information
that
the
governmental
interest
was
directed
to
in
this
case.
it
is
relevant
of
course
in
balancing
the
competing
public
and
private
interest
to
consider
what
information
of
value
the
subcommittee
might
have
elicited
by
a
frank
answer
to
the
question.
now
focusing
again
on
the
question
involved
in
count
7,
the
chairman
of
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee
had
indicated
that
the
subcommittee
had
information
that
there
was
a
communist
newspaper
cell
still
in
operation
in
new
york
city.
when
the
petitioner
was
asked
whether
the
new
york
herald
tribune
cell
to
which
he
had
belonged
was
still
in
existence,
he
stated
that
he
did
not
know.
he
was
then
asked
the
question
on
which
count
7
is
based,
a
question
that
would
obviously
have
thrown
some
light
on
that
subject
and
that
is
whether
any
of
its
fellow
members
of
that
cell
as
of
1948
were
still
with
the
herald
tribune.
now,
a
negative
answer
would've
provided
a
strong,
albeit
not
conclusive
indication
that
the
existing
cell
was
not
in
the
new
york
herald
tribune
and
perhaps
the
subcommittee
would,
on
the
basis
of
that
information
have
held
justified
in
concentrating
its
investigatory
efforts
elsewhere.
an
affirmative
answer,
would
have
confirm
the
subcommittee
and
the
possibility
that
the
existing
cell
was
in
the
herald
tribune
and
as
i've
indicated
would
have
lay
a
foundation
for
a
number
of
additional
questions
such
as
whether
any
of
these
persons
who
were
in
that
cell
in
1948
and
still
with
the
herald
tribune,
whether
any
of
them
were
to
petitioner's
knowledge
members
of
the
communist
party,
what
their
numbers
were
that
is
to
say
how
many
of
them
there
were,
what
their
party
functions
were
and
whether
or
not,
they
had
any
supervisory
or
policy
functions
with
the
newspaper.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
don't
suppose
that
they
could
legislate
directly
on
that
subject
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
they
could.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no
sir,
i
should
say
they
could
not.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
what
we
must
remember
in
cases
like
this
it's
not
necessarily
into
this
specific
area
of
the
press
of
course
that
congress
might
wish
to
legislate.
for
example
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
this
part
of
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
--
the
basic
inquiry
was
certainly
focused
on
that
question.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
sir.
now,
let
me
suggest
this
that
for
example
the
--
if
the
--
if
the
subcommittee
should
find
for
example
that
in
particularly
critical
areas
such
as
the
ability
to
influence
public
opinion
one
way
or
the
other.
the
communists
had
infiltrated
extensively,
that
may
be
the
basis
for
the
committees
wanting
to
for
the
congress
wanting
to
strengthen
the
internal
security
laws
generally,
or
on
the
other
hand
if
they
should
determine
for
example
that
there
was
no
serious
problem
in
the
--
in
certain
critical
areas
such
as
press,
education
and
whatnot.
they
might
decide,
well
since
they
don't
--
since
the
communist
does
not
seem
to
be
getting
into
the
areas
that
can
really
influence
public
opinion
and
really
cause
a
serious
difficulty,
maybe
we
should
like
to
draw
back
a
little
bit.
perhaps
we
should
like
to
enlighten
the
internal
security
laws.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
--
no.
i
wouldn't
agree
that
they
could
nor
would
i
agree
that
they
could
go
through
all
the
newspapers
and
question
all
of
the
writers,
and
the
editors
on
the
substance
of
what
they
had
written
in
those
papers,
but
that
certainly
isn't
involved
in
this
case.
and
there
was
no
questioning
here
on
the
substance
of
the
newspapers
on
what
these
reporters
(voice
overlap)
mererly
on
their
activities.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
sir.
we're
in
that
area
just
as
we
were
in
the
area
of
education
in
barenblatt
and
there
the
court
said
that
the
educational
institution
is
not
a
sanctuary,
simply
because
it
is
an
institution
of
education
and
simply
because
that
area
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
--
is
sensitive.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
the
conduct
here
was
a
lawful
activity.
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
there
is
no
indication
one
way
or
the
other
mr.
justice.
one
can
only
assume
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
if
they
have
the
names,
their
valid
legislative
interest
might
be
in
confirming
their
information
we
would
certainly
contend
that
that
would
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
black,
perhaps
i
might
suggest
that
if
the
information
they
had
was
so
absolute
--
absolutely
certain
perhaps
by
reason
of
admissions
of
the
persons
in
question
that
there
was
no
possible
reason
for
having
that
information
confirmed
if
that
information
was
not
needed
to
be
stated
in
order
to
lay
a
foundation
for
further
questioning.
it
is
conceivable
that
the
case
might
arise
in
which
there
could
be
no
valid
legislative
purpose,
but
i
suggest
that
this
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
i
suggest
that
in
the
first
place,
mr.
justice,
in
this
case,
that
particular
question
just
is
not
presented.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
would
because
not
only
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
not
only
for
the
reasons
that
i've
suggested
in
order
to
confirm
the
basis
of
the
information
they
already
have
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
--
to
lay
a
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
again
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
would
say
that
in
this
--
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
in
pursuit
of
the
kind
of
legislative
inquiry
that
this
committee
was
conducting,
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a
valid
legislative
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice,
naturally,
this
is
a
part
of
the
entire
inquiry
into
the
extent
of
infiltration
of
the
free
press
and
this
was
an
important
piece
of
information
to
fit
into
that
whole
checkerboard
that
had
been
testified
to
by
a
number
of
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
--
witnesses.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
they
do
enjoy
special
favors,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
presumably
so
without
affecting
the
freedom
of
the
press.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
certainly
does.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
most
certainly
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
oh,
i
was
about
to
say
that
--
i
would
say
that
if
the
committee
had
some
basis
for
concluding
that
those
individuals
could
provide
the
committee
with
information
that
would
help
it
in
its
inquiry
into
infiltration
into
the
press
that
it
could
ask
those
people
questions.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
part
of
the
inquiry
was
whether
or
not
that
was
so.
of
course,
it
is
quite
possible
that
those
in
command
might
not
know
that
there
were
members
of
the
communist
party
among
their
employees.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
he
may
mr.
chief
justice
although
quite
possibly
he
would
be
lacking
in
a
great
many
of
the
details
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
communist
party
may
have
intended
to
operate
within
the
area
of
the
press
and
so
on.
but
i
don't
doubt
at
all
as
to
that
in
answer
to
your
question
that
he
would
certainly
have
relevant
information
on
the
subject.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
again,
so
long
as
they
had
some
basis
for
knowing
that
the
--
for
believing
that
the
individual
did
have
some
information
that
would
be
helpful
to
the
committee,
yes
sir.
i
see
that
my
time
is
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
try
to
deal
with
all
the
points
covered
by
the
petitioner
and
first
to
the
point
that
he
dealt
with
in
most
detailed
last
and
that's
the
subject
under
inquiry
and
pertinency
of
the
questions
to
that
subject.
now,
it
is
the
government's
contention
that
the
subject
under
inquiry
was
in
fact
proved
to
be
communist
infiltration
into
the
news
media.
and
the
basic
reasons
as
far
as
the
hearings
as
a
whole
are
concerned
are
those
that
i
stated
in
arguing
the
whitman
case.
here,
however,
it
is
very
important
for
the
court
to
realize
that
at
trial
counsel
for
the
petitioner
repeatedly
conceded
that
the
subject
under
inquiry
is
precisely
what
i've
said
that
it
is,
communist
infiltration
into
news
media
and
we've
set
forth
the
citations
and
some
of
the
quotations
of
those
concessions
at
pages
27
and
28
of
our
brief
in
this
case.
moreover,
the
whole
premise
of
petitioner's
argument
which
he
makes
most
vigorously
in
his
brief
that
this
whole
hearing
constituted
an
unwarranted
attack
on
the
free
press.
the
whole
premise
of
that
argument
is
that
these
hearings
were
in
fact
concerned
with
communist
infiltration
into
news
media.
after
this,
i
should
like
to
advert
to
one
point
that
petitioner
does
make
in
his
brief
that
is
a
seemingly
inconsistent
remark
by
subcommittee
counsel
part
of
which
is
quoted
in
the
petitioner's
brief
at
page
25
here
and
which
is
set
out
in
more
detail
in
the
whitman
brief
at
page
22.
that
statement
which
as
i
say
is
referred
to
by
counsel
here
and
has
been
referred
to
by
counsel
and
some
of
the
other
cases,
is
to
the
effect
that
mr.
sourwine,
the
subcommittee
counsel,
denied
that
infiltration
of
the
press
was
the
subject
under
inquiry.
now,
to
understand
that
remark
it
must
be
appreciated
that
there
had
been
public
statements
to
the
effect
that
these
hearings
were
an
attack
upon
the
free
press.
the
subcommittee
was
most
sensitive
to
this
charge
as
i
think
we
would
all
agree
and
rightly
should
be.
and
their
concern
was
evidenced
by
statements
that
i
have
referred
to
in
prior
arguments
made
both
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee
and
by
senator
hennings
particularly
at
page
1588
of
the
hearing
record.
now,
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
context
that
in
making
of
the
remark
that
counsel
had
referred
to
here,
the
subcommittee
counsel
thought
whether
he
was
reasonable
and
thinking
so
or
not,
but
the
subcommittee
counsel
thought
that
the
committee
was
then
being
charged
with
an
attack
on
the
free
press
and
his
denial
goes
to
that.
it's
particularly
obvious
that
this
must
be
so
since
he
went
on
to
state
that
the
chairman
has
already
told
you
that
that
is
not
the
case.
well,
the
only
thing
that
the
chairman
had
already
told
anyone
was
that
this
was
not
an
attack
on
the
free
press.
i
might
point
out
that
in
any
event,
petitioner
was
not
present
when
this
remark
was
made.
it
goes
only
to
the
question
of
what
the
subject
under
inquiry
in
fact
was.
now,
as
to
the
appraisal
of
the
petitioner,
that
raises
of
course
of
the
subject
matter
and
pertinency,
our
contention
is
that
the
witness
did
not
object
to
this
at
the
hearing
and
that
under
both
watkins
and
barenblatt,
a
witness
must
make
a
specific
objections
on
these
grounds
in
order
for
it
to
be
effective.
the
statement
that
he
made,
again,
a
lengthily
legal
memorandum,
was
clearly
insufficient
under
barenblatt
where
roughly
the
same
kind
of
legal
memorandum
was
involved.
and
we
understand
from
what
petitioner
says
at
page
29
of
his
brief
that
in
essence
he
conceives
that
this
is
so.
i
read
the
bottom
of
page
29
of
his
brief
as
largely
conceding
that
no
objection
was
made.
in
any
event,
we
believe
that
he
was
satisfactorily
appraised.
the
witness
ahead
of
him
who
appeared
was
a
newsman,
who
was
questioned
about
his
party
affiliations
and
about
infiltration
into
the
typographical
union.
the
petitioner
was
asked
some
preliminary
questions
concerning
--
concerned
primarily
with
his
newspaper
background.
as
far
as
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
are
concerned,
counsel
at
trial
conceded
that
at
least
counts
one,
two
and
eight
are
pertinent
to
an
investigation
of
communist
infiltration
of
news
media
and
that
concession
appears
at
pages
291
and
292
of
the
trial
transcript
in
this
case.
now,
on
the
basis
for
calling
the
petitioner
before
the
subcommittee,
petitioner
raises
this
question
generally
and
also
in
a
context
of
his
effort
to
subpoena
subcommittee
records
not
only
on
petitioner
but
on
other
--
on
one
other
person,
and
also
to
his
efforts
to
cross-examine
with
respect
to
confidential
informants.
now,
we
contend
that
neither
at
the
hearing
nor
at
the
trial
did
petitioner
rebut
the
presumption
of
regularity
in
the
subcommittee's
calling
the
petitioner
so
as
to
bring
its
basis
for
doing
so
into
issue.
however,
we
do
believe
that
the
record
is
perfectly
plain
that
petitioner
was
not
called
as
a
result
of
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures.
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
subcommittee
counsel
gave
sworn
testimony
as
to
the
information
on
the
basis
of
which
petitioner
was
called.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
counsel
did
omit
a
little
bit
of
the
information
that
counsel
testified
was
a
part
of
the
basis
for
he's
being
called.
we
--
incidentally,
the
initial
--
the
basis
for
he's
being
called
in
the
first
place
as
testified
to
by
subcommittee
counsel
at
trial
is
set
forth
on
page
5
of
our
brief.
and
i
would
want
to
point
out
that
among
the
things
that
were
involved
were
information
that
petitioner
after
returning
from
war
time
naval
service
had
flown
an
airplane
on
a
trip
to
central
and
south
america
during
which
time
he
is
accompanied
by
a
courier
for
the
communist
party.
then
subcommittee
counsel
as
--
as
counsel
for
petitioner
has
pointed
out,
petitioner
was
called
before
an
executive
session
and
then
after
some
time
had
elapsed,
he
was
called
before
an
open
session.
now,
on
pages
6
and
7
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
forth
the
information
or
i
should
say
the
reasons
stated
by
subcommittee
counsel
at
the
trial
as
to
why
petitioner
was
recalled
in
open
session
after
he
had
refused
to
answer
questions
in
executive
session.
and
in
essence,
the
reasons
there
stated
are
that
the
committee
had
had
experience
in
the
past
that
some
times
a
witness
after
being
--
being
given
a
chance
to
think
it
over
did
decide
to
answer
the
questions
and
that
from
the
very
--
the
demeanor
of
the
witness,
they
felt
that
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
information,
that
he
might
be
willing
to
disclose
at
a
later
time,
as
i
say
this
is
set
forth
on
pages
6
and
7
of
our
brief.
subcommittee
counsel
did
submit
to
cross-examination
on
such
things
as
when
the
various
information
that
the
subcommittee
had
that
was
received
and
in
what
form,
but
here
again,
while
it
appeared
that
the
court
might
be
willing
to
allow
cross-examination
along
the
same
general
lines,
the
court
did
draw
the
line
at
the
request
of
the
government
that
requiring
the
subcommittee
counsel
to
disclose
the
confidential
informants.
therefore,
the
information
on
which
the
subcommittee
did
base
its
calling
of
the
petitioner
is
as
an
in
prior
cases
substantially
the
same
as
this
court
did
regard
in
barenblatt
as
having
been
sufficient
to
rebut
the
notion
that
petitioner
there
was
called
as
a
result
of
any
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures.
now,
one
point
that
has
been
raised
and
a
number
of
these
cases
that
has
not
yet
been
dealt
with
and
i
should
like
to
deal
with
briefly
at
this
point
is
one
of
the
indictment
points
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
indictment
had
to
allege
willfulness
because
that
issue
is
in
a
number
of
these
cases.
now,
the
statute
that
is
involved
here,
2
u.s.c.
192
does
not
contain
any
statement,
willful
or
otherwise,
concerning
state
of
mind
that
is
required
to
be
proved
in
these
cases.
however,
this
court
in
the
quinn
case,
349
u.s.
155
said
that
it
is
a
deliberate
intentional
refusal
to
answer
that
is
required
in
these
instances
and
the
indictment
in
this
case
as
in
several
of
the
others
alleged
unlawfully.
now,
the
only
court
which
is
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
that
has
directly
focused
on
this
question
has
repeatedly
said
that
this
is
enough,
that
is
to
say
that
the
word
“lawfully”
is
enough,
particularly,
particularly,
since
the
very
word
“refusal”
which
of
course
is
in
all
of
these,
itself
imports
a
deliberate
intentional
act
now
which
of
course
is
what
is
required
under
the
quinn
case.
now,
petitioner
has
in
oral
argument
hinted
at,
but
in
his
brief
exten
--
extensively
argued
his
contention
that
this
hearing
and
the
hearings
of
which
it
was
a
part
constituted
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
because
there
was
an
investigation
of
the
press.
now,
the
fourth
estate
is
not
immune
to
investigation
simply
because
it
is
the
press.
other
fields
that
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment
have
been
held
subject
to
investigation
such
as
education
in
the
barenblatt
case,
propaganda
in
the
braden
and
wilkinson
cases.
and
the
statements
of
this
court
made
in
the
barenblatt
case
i
think
are
particularly
applicable.
i
have
adverted
to
them
before,
the
notion
that
an
educational
institution
is
not
a
constitutional
sanctuary
from
inquiry
in
to
matters
that
may
otherwise
be
within
the
constitutional
legislative
domain
merely
for
the
reason
that
inquiries
made
of
someone
within
its
walls.
and
further
that,
we
think
the
investigatory
power
in
this
domain
is
not
to
be
denied
to
congress
solely
because
the
field
of
education
is
involved
and
we
submit
that
no
less
is
true
of
the
press.
furthermore,
in
this
case,
there
is
simply
no
basis
for
the
assertion
that
it
was
the
free
press
as
such
that
was
being
investigated
rather
than
communist
infiltration
in
news
media.
the
chairman
and
senator
hennings
expressly
disavowed
any
purpose
to
investigate
the
press
as
such.
their
statements
at
--
in
the
hearings
at
pages
1588
and
1717
to
1718
are
most
impressive
in
that
regard.
and
i
note
that
this
court
in
the
barenblatt
case
relied
on
similar
statements
to
answer
the
contention
that
the
education
that
the
content
of
the
classroom
as
such
was
being
investigated.
the
questions
that
were
asked
in
these
hearings
of
petitioner
and
of
the
other
witnesses
that
appeared,
probed
in
to
the
witnesses'
positions,
their
activities,
their
associations,
not
what
they
wrote,
not
the
content
of
the
newspapers
for
which
they
worked.
the
hearings
themselves
were
pursuant
to
winston
burdett's
testimony
that
the
communists
had
in
fact
infiltrated
news
media
and
the
committee
was
following
up
that
information.
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
found
to
the
contrary
in
this
case,
that's
at
page
4
of
the
record,
by
reference
to
its
opinion
in
the
shelton
case
which
in
turn
is
at
page
242
of
the
shelton
record
where
it
said,
“this
inquiry
was
in
no
sense
an
investigation
into
the
press
as
such,
but
into
the
question
whether
the
constitutionally
guaranteed
freedom
of
the
press
was
being
used
to
undermine
that
very
freedom
and
the
foundation
on
which
it
rests.”
now,
one
further
point
is
made
with
respect
to
the
authority
of
the
subcommittee
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
contention
that
whatever
the
reach
of
senate
resolution
366,
it
does
not
--
congress
did
not
intend
that
news
media
be
reached.
of
course,
it
was
similarly
contended
in
the
barenblatt
case
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
a
subcommittee
or
a
committee
be
authorized
to
investigate
education.
and
of
course,
the
court
rejected
that
argument
for
reasons
that
are
equally
applicable
here.
there
is
no
indication
whatever
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
the
press
from
the
authority
that
it
gave
to
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee
and
certainly
that
is
an
area
that
is
no
less
sensitive
than
education.
furthermore,
the
senate
clearly
approved
of
this
particular
phase
of
the
subcommittee's
work.
the
subcommittee
had
conducted
hearings
on
communist
activities
in
radio
and
television
and
non-communist
propaganda,
these
are
cited
at
pages
26
and
27
of
our
brief
in
the
liveright
case.
furthermore
with
full
knowledge
of
the
instant
hearings
which
have
been
reported
to
them
in
senate
report
1385
of
the
84th
congress,
senator
--
the
senate
appropriated
a
large
sum
with
which
the
subcommittee
was
to
continue
these
very
hearings.
now,
we
submit
that
there
cannot
be
any
serious
contention
that
these
hearings
were
authorized
by
the
senate.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
none
of
the
material
that
came
up
in
trial
was
--
as
far
as
any
contention
that
we've
ever
heard
came
as
a
surprise
to
the
petitioner.
this
was
all
going
into
in
the
hearings.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
this
information
was
not
new
as
far
as
the
petitioner
is
concerned.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes
sir,
in
term
--
and
in
terms
both
of
information
stated
to
be
in
the
possession
of
the
subcommittee
and
in
terms
of
the
questions
that
were
asked,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
there's
no
in
--
there
is
no
definite
indication
that
it
was,
but
--
there's
no
--
there's
no
clear
indication
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no
clear
indication
except
that
he
had
--
he
has
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
i'm
talking
about
what
--
i'm
talking
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
the
indication
yes
sir.
i'm
saying
that
the
record
itself
does
not
clearly
reflect
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
think
it's
probably
a
fair
way
to
read
the
record
that
it
is
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
this
was
brought
forward
as
one
of
a
number
of
items
and
i
think
you'll
see
that
in
the
context,
the
one
of
the
least
important
items
--
a
number
of
items
that
the
subcommittee
had.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
oh,
it
might
very
well
be.
of
course
there's
no
--
there
was
no
jury
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
it
conceivably
it
might
but
as
i
say
there
was
no
jury.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
think
it
might.
well
again,
there
was
no
jury
in
this
case
and
furthermore
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no
sir,
no
jury.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
would
hope
not
sir.
