mr.
harry
i.
rand
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
like
the
three
which
had
preceded
it,
seeks
the
reversal
of
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
affirming
a
conviction
for
contempt
under
2
usc
192.
petitioner
here,
at
the
time
he
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
in
early
1956
in
washington
before
the
internal
security
subcommittee
of
the
senate,
was
employed
as
a
program
director
at
a
new
orleans
television
station.
when
he
appeared
in--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
a
program
director.
when
he
appeared
in
response
to
the
subpoena
on
march
19,
1956,
he
found
sitting
as
the
sole
member
of
the
subcommittee
senator
eastland.
and,
he
was
interrogated
for
some
hours
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day,
first,
in
closed
executive
session
for
about
five
minutes,
and
then
an
open
public
session
for
about,
i
think,
an
hour-and-a
half
to
two
hours
by
senator
eastland,
the
sole
member
of
the
subcommittee
sitting
throughout
the
entire
session,
and
by
robert
morris
who,
at
that
time,
was
chief
counsel
of
the
subcommittee.
he
answered
numerous
questions
put
to
him
with
respect
to
his
educational
and
employment
background.
he
refused,
however,
to
answer
15
questions,
including
inquiries
as
to
whether
he
was
then
a
communist
and
whether
he
had,
at
any
time
in
the
past,
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
insisting
that,
in
light
of
the
scriptures
of
the
first
amendment,
the
subcommittee
had
no
authority
or
power
to
inquire
into
his
personal
and
private
affairs,
into
his
political
beliefs,
or
into
his
associational
activities.
when
he
was
asked
whether
he
was
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment,
he
expressly
disclaimed
any
reliance
on
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
accorded
by
that
amendment.
for
his
refusal
to
answer
the
15
questions,
he
was
indicted
for
contempt.
he
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
similar
in
nature
to
the
motion
which
was
filed
in
each
of
the
preceding
cases
argued
to
this
court,
a
motion,
in
part,
putting
an
issue
of
a
question
as
to
the
competence
of
the
grand
jury
and
other
questions
which
have
been
argued
to
your
honors
here
this
last
week
and
this
morning.
the
motion
to
dismiss,
like
the
other
motions
in
the
other
cases,
was
denied
in
all
respects.
petitioner
went
to
trial.
he
was
convicted,
fined,
and
sentenced
to
three
months
imprisonment.
we
urge
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
conviction
on
each
of
the
grounds
which
we
have
set
forth
in
the
eight
divisions
in
the
argument
of
our
brief.
we
cannot,
of
course,
in
this
half-hour
argue
orally
each
one
of
those
points.
with
the
court's
permission
and
to
the
extent
time
permits,
i
should
like,
therefore,
to
address
myself
just
to
two
of
the
grounds
on
which
we
rely
for
reversal.
first,
it's
our
contention
that
petitioner
here,
in
this
case,
was
denied
an
opportunity
adequately
to
cross-examine
and
to
make
a
full
defense
with
respect
to
the
issue
which
has,
here,
been
called
the
issue
of
probable
cause.
i
think
it's
now
in
plain
view
of
the
briefs
filed
by
the
government
and
in
view
of
the
oral
arguments
made
by
government
counsel
in
this
court
this
last
week
that
whatever
the
quarrel
may
be
between
the
government
and
the
petitioners
here
as
to
the
assimilation
of
fourth
amendment
criteria
to
cases
of
this
kind,
whatever
their
quarrel
may
be
as
to
the
quantum
of
proof
necessary
to
prove
probable
cause,
as
we
have
termed
the
issue,
that
the
government
now
concedes
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
government
to
make
a
showing
and
the
duty
of
the
courts
to
consider
in
striking
the
balance
which
this
court
says
must
be
struck
between
the
private
interest
and
the
public
interest
involved,
it's
the
duty
of
the
court
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
the
private
interest
and
the
public
interest
in
maintaining
privacy
inviolate
as
against
the
public
interest
in
securing
testimony
from
a
witness,
notwithstanding
the
scriptures
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
at
a
particular
hearing
from
a
particular
witness.
the
government
now
tells
us
that
they
agree
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
the
government
says
that
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
if
the
showing
is
made
that
it's
not
otherwise
obtainable
from
anyone,
now,
so
far
as
i
know,
none
of
these
cases
has
such
a
showing
been
made
by
the
government
that
the
--
that
it's
in
none
of
these
cases,
if
i
remember
my
records,
has
the
government
that
the
evidence
sought
from
this
particular
witness
has
not
been
obtained
or
could
not
have
been
obtained
from
other
sources,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i'm
sorry?
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
right.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
right.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
assume
in
many
other
proceedings,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
right,
and
i
suppose
in
each
of
these
proceedings,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
one
considers
the
type
of
proceeding
which
is
involved,
the
urgency
for
securing
the
information
in
this
particular
hearing
by
this
particular
tribunal
in
this
particular
manner,
the
question
as
to
whether
the
information
might
not
be
procurable
in
other
fashions
and
all
these
factors.
i
am
sure
this
court
as
well
as
other
courts
will
consider
and
are
required
to
consider
in
order
to
determine
whether,
under
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case
where
a
particular
witness
is
being
heard
and
being
interrogated
in
a
particular
fashion,
first
amendment
rights
should
be
invaded
or
may
be
invaded
notwithstanding
the
great
interest,
not
only
of
the
public,
but
of
the
courts
and
of
the
congress,
i
assume,
in
maintaining
privacy
inviolate
to
the
extent
it
can
be
maintained
inviolate
where
urgent
interests
of
state
do
not
require
that
an
invade
--
that
it
be
invaded.
now,
i
as--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
did
not
intend
that
to
mean
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
am
not
so-agreeing,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
would
protest
any
such
equation
of
interest
or
urgencies,
indeed--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
even
in
a
larceny
case.
indeed,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
of
course
that's
not
the
case
i'm
arguing
here.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
yes,
but
in
these
cases
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
mr.
jus
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
question
is.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
assume
statements
were
being
made.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
but,
i
had
not
heard
any
questions.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
to
the
extent
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
the
extent
that
a
human
being
citizen
or
non-citizen
protests
interrogation
on
the
ground
that
his
first
amendment
rights
or
the
rights
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
thus,
the
rights
to
express
himself
to
hold
political
beliefs,
the
rights
to
have
had
certain
associational
activities,
to
the
extent
that
a
witness,
even
on
a
criminal
trial,
contends
that
that
is
being
invaded,
to
that
extent,
i
believe
a
court
would
consider
the
urgency
of
securing
such
testimony
as
against
the
witness'
right
to
remain
silent.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
now
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
as
i
understand,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
defendant
is
not
trying
to
protect
his
own
rights,
as
you
put
the
case
to
me.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
the
defendant
--
the
defendant
is
merely
suggesting
that
he
would
prefer
not
to
have
others
put
on
as
live
witnesses
who
would
stipulate
as
to
the
fact.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
am
pleased
that
i
do
not
have
to
argue
that
case
here,
but
i
do
think
that
the
urgency
of
law
enforcement
is
something
different
from
the
urgency
of
securing
information
for
the
purpose
of
considering
whether
a
law,
not
defined,
shall
be
enacted
at
some
future
date.
i'm
surprised,
for
example,
when
the
government,
here,
urges
on
this
issue
of
probable
cause
that,
although
the
quantum
of
proof,
the
probandum,
in
a
criminal
prosecution
may
be
substantial,
it
should
be
less
substantial
here.
that
is,
that
one
--
that
a
congressional
committee
need
not
have
as
much
cause
to
call
a
witness,
says
the
government,
as
one
that
needs
in
a
law
enforcement
procedure
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
understand
that.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
mr.
justice
black,
i
--
although
i
have
no
cases
to
support
my
position,
i
should
think
that
would
be
so.
i
see
no
reason,
for
example,
why
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
which
traditionally,
has
been
protected
in
the
courts,
as
well
as
in
congressional
committees,
should
be
put
on
al
higher
level
than
the
privilege
under
the
first
amendment,
not
the
fifth,
to
remain
silent
with
respect
to
certain
activities
and
with
respect
to
certain
beliefs.
now,
i
don't
know
that
the
courts
have
been
confronted
with
this
problem
and
i
hope,
for
one,
that
i
need
not
be
here
to
argue
the
problem.
i
think
it's
a
more
difficult
one.
it's
a
more
difficult
case
to
argue
than
the
case
i'm
arguing
here
and
particularly,
if
i
may
continue,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
government
has
now
conceded
that
what
must
be
shown
here
as
a
minimum
is
that
the
committee
--
the
subcommittee
in
this
case
had
some
information
in
its
possession
or
within
its
knowledge
which
gave
it
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
this
particular
witness,
mr.
liveright,
petitioner
here,
had
something
--
some
information
which
might
be
of
value
to
the
investigation
in
which
the
subcommittee
was,
at
that
time,
engaged.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
some
--
of
some
value
to
the
subcommittee,
in
that
the
subcommittee
might
learn
something
by
interrogating
this
witness
in
connection
with
an
investigation
in
which
it
presumably
was
engaged.
now
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
in
order
to
legislate
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
in
order
to
legislate.
i
don't
know
for
what
purpose
here
because
the
committee
has
not
made
a
claim
--
the
subcommittee
has
not
made
a
claim
in
this
case
what
legislation
it
had
in
mind,
what
specific
legislation
it
had
in
mind
and,
as
i
shall
argue,
as
we
argue
in
our
brief
certainly,
the
subcommittee
here
likewise,
in
our
opinion,
had
not
specifically
delineated
the
subject
matter.
so
that,
here,
we
are
dealing
with
many
generalities
and
many
vague
concepts
but,
at
least,
the
government
says
“we
agree
we
have
to
make
a
showing
and
we
agree
that
the
court
had
to
consider
whether
this
subcommittee
had
some
information
which
gave
it
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
this
petitioner
could
be
of
some
help
to
it
in
the
investigative
process
leading
toward
legislation
somewhere
in
the
mind
of
the
subcommittee.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
the
government
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
of
course,
this
argument
is
within
that
framework.
we,
of
course,
argue
that
there
was
no
true
legislative
purpose
but,
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
i
may
direct
your
attention
to
the
government's
brief,
i
think
i
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
no
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
we
are
contending
here
that
this
was
not
a
legitimate
investigation,
not--
it's
true
because
we
do
not
accept
the
barenblatt
case
and
we
are
still
--
we
believe
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
not
we,
i
believe.
let
me
say
that
because
the
barenblatt
case,
of
course,
does
not
govern
the
other
cases
such
as
shelton,
price,
whitman
where
there
was
a
profess
examination
or
investigation
into
infiltration
in
the
press.
one
may
--
this
court
--
a
majority
of
this
court
may
ultimately
assimilate
barenblatt
to
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
do
not
believe
that
a
majority
of
this
court
has
said
that
the
congressional
committees
have
--
such
as
these,
have
authority
to
investigate
communist
infiltration
into
the
press.
i
think
that--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
i
have
not
said
that
education
is
alright,
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
i'd
like,
if
i
may,
to
direct
myself
to
your
question.
i
do
not--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
sorry.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
have
not
so
read
it,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
had
not
so
understood
it
but,
of
course,
the
government
reads
it
that
way,
mr.
justice
black.
the
government
reads
barenblatt
as
justifying
what
they
say
is
an
investigation
into
communist
activities
or
organization
in
general
in
the
united
states.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
had
not
so
read
the
dissenting
opinions,
but
if
i
can
get
back
to
mr.
liveright
who
of
course
has
retained
me
as
his
counsel,
i
should
like
to
--
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
remarks
suggesting
that
i
am
mistaking
the
government's
position.
and,
i
should
like
to
direct
the
court,
mr.
justice
harlan
particularly,
to
page
52
of
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
where
the
government
says
expressly
--
this
is
at
the
first
full
paragraph
sec
--
third
sentence.
this
court
indicated
in
barenblatt
that
congressional
committees
can
subpoena
a
witness,
at
least
when
the
investigation
is
in
an
area
closely
related
to
rights
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
only
if
the
committee
has
information
giving
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
the
witness
has
information
of
value
to
the
investigation.
similar
statement
made
at
page
54
of
the
brief,
similar
statement
made
in
the
shelton
briefs,
so
i
certainly
did
not
intend
to
mistake
the
government's
position.
i
understand
the
position
as
orally
stated
here,
notwithstanding
mr.
justice
frankfurter's,
i
think,
attempt
to
secure
a
greater
clarification,
perhaps
a
more
limited
statement
from
the
government.
the
government's
position
stated
here
is
that
the
government
must
show
in
every
trial
for
contempt
under
2
usc
192
in
these
cases,
and
that
the
court
must
consider
whether
there
is
information
which
the
committee
knew
about,
had
in
its
possession,
with
respect
to
this
particular
witness,
giving
it
reason
to
believe
that
this
witness
had
something
to
tell
the
committee
which
would
help
it
in
its
legislative
--
in
its
investigative
process.
so,
we
get
down
really
to
two
questions
which
are
essentials
in
these
cases.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that
is
not
my
position.
personally,
that
is
not
my
position.
i
know
it
was
mr.
rauh's
position.
i
b
--
it
may
well
be
that
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
let
me--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
if
a
witness
inquires,
it
may
be
the
duty.
but,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
he
did
not.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
what's
being
confused
are
two
considerations
here.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
first
---
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
i'm
trying,
despite
great
difficulty
to
keep
them
clear
in
my
presentation.
the
first
--
we
are
not
urging
what
has
generally
been
called
the
matter
of
luminosity
here.
in
other
words,
we're
not
urging
that
there
has
been
any
defect
in
these
proceedings
by
reason
of
mr.
liveright
not
being
informed,
despite
his
questioning,
despite
his
inquiry,
or
notwithstanding
the
lack
of
inquiry,
not
being
informed
as
to
why
he
was
being
called.
we,
however,
are
urging
that
the
government
concedes
that,
in
order
to
effect
this
balancing
process,
in
order
that
a
balance
which
this
court
says
must
be
struck,
the
trial
court
must
consider
what
it
was
that
was
so
important
to
the
committee
which
caused
it
to
call
this
witness
to
ask
him
questions
generally
deemed
to
invade
first
amendment
areas
and,
when
he
refused
to
answer
them,
to
submit
him
to
the
courts
for
punishment
for
contempt.
as
i
read
this
court's
opinions,
the
majority
opinions
in
this
court,
this
court
has
said
the
trial
court
must
strike
that
balance
because,
unless
it
strikes
that
balance,
we're
in
danger
of
having
first
--
the
rights
generally
deemed
protected
under
the
first
amendment
unjustly
invaded.
the
government
apparently
reads
the
opinions
of
this
court
the
same
way
because
the
government
says,
“we
agree
that,
at
the
trial,
we've
got
to
show
to
the
trial
court,
because
the
trial
court
has
to
affect
this
balance
to
strike
it,
we've
got
to
show
to
the
trial
court
why
it
was
we
--
the
subcommittee
wanted
this
witness.”
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
i
agree,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
i
do
not
have
to
go
that
far
for
purposes
of
this
case.
for
purposes
of
the
case,
i'm
arguing
here
today.
such
retroactive
testimony,
we
are
running
into
in
all
these
cases,
as
your
honors
have
noted.
with
respect
to
subject
matter
of
inquiry,
we're
continually
getting
rationalizations
after
the
fact.
in
this
case,
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
least
that
was
required,
and
so
the
government
concedes,
i
know
it
--
the
government's
concession
does
not
bind
the
court.
but,
the
government
concedes
that
the
least
that
was
required
was
a
showing
at
the
trial
stage
of
this
proceeding
of
what
information
this
subcommittee
had
in
order
to
justify
its
summoning
of
this
petitioner
in
this
investigation.
now,
what
happened
here,
this
was
not
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
should
think
so.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
unless
there
is
some
showing
to
the
courts
of
why
the
witness
is
there
or
why
he's
being
asked
the
questions,
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
whole
balancing
process
is
merely
lip
service,
t
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
am
trying
to
argue
within
them,
mr.
justice
black,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
arguing
within
them,
we
have
been
denied
our
rights
here.
the
government
introduced,
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
evidence
through
the
mouth
of
mr.
robert
morris,
chief
counsel
of
the
subcommittee
and
the
only
material
witness
for
the
government,
evidence
as
to
what
information
the
subcommittee
had,
the
warrant
justifying
the
summoning
of
this
witness,
what
information
it
had
prior
to
the
subpoenaing
of
the
witness.
when
we
cross-examined
mr.
morris,
we
found
mr.
morris
told
us
that
he
had
secured
this
information
from
a
confidential
informant
whom
he
described
as
a
reliable
informant.
we
sought,
by
cross-examination,
to
obtain
the
identity
of
this
informant.
the
government
objected
and
we
were
denied
an
identification
of
the
informant.
we
sought
to
ascertain
whether
the
informant
was
a
professional
informant
or
casual
informant.
the
trial
court
denied
us
an
opportunity
to
inquire
as
to
that.
mr.
morris
had
said
that
he
talked
to
this
unnamed
informant
on
three
or
four
occasions
about
petitioner
here
and
it
was
those
discussions
on
those
three
or
four
occasions
either
by
telephone
or
outside
mr.
morris'
office
that
had
led
the
subcommittee
to
summon
this
witness.
we
tried
to
test
the
credibility
of
mr.
morris'
testimony
by
asking
how
long
these
discussions
had
lasted
with
respect
to
petitioner.
the
trial
court,
on
the
government's
objections,
refused
to
permit
us
to
inquire
for
these
matters.
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
trial,
we
had
subpoenaed
--
we
had
issued
subpoenas
to
mr.
morris,
as
chief
counsel
of
the
subcommittee,
and
to
the
senate
clerk
requesting
that
the
--
all
the
information
on
the
files
of
the
subcommittee
relating
to
petitioner
be
brought
to
court
to
enable
us
to
inspect
that
information
and
to
use
it
if
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
use
it.
on
the
government's
motion,
those
subpoenas
were
quashed
in
their
entirety.
after
mr.
morris
had
completed
his
testimony
and
we'd
been
denied
cross-examination
of
mr.
morris,
we
again
asked
the
court
to
direct
that
mr.
morris
be
instructed
to
bring
into
the
courtroom
that
information,
so
far
as
it
was
reflected
in
writing,
relating
to
this
petitioner
which
mr.
morris
had
said
had
caused
the
subcommittee
to
subpoena
him.
this
time,
the
court
didn't
wait
for
any
government
objections.
the
court
summarily
and
peremptorily
denied
our
request.
so,
what
happened
here
was
that
we
were
denied
any
opportunity,
whether
by
cross-examination,
by
subpoena,
or
otherwise
to
test
the
credibility
of
what
mr.
morris
had
said
was
the
inf
--
had
said
as
to
the
information
causing
the
summoning
of
this
witness
as
to
the
need
by
the
subcommittee
for
this
witness'
testimony.
nothing
appears
in
the
record
to
indicate
why
mr.
morris
should've
been
granted
such
favors,
favors
generally
not
granted
other
witnesses
whether
government
or
otherwise.
the
only
reason
which
the
trial
court
has
signed
for
denial
of
our
right
to
cross-examine,
denial
of
our
request
for
information
was
that
the
information,
according
to
the
representations
of
government
counsel
and
mr.
morris,
was
confidential.
i
want
to
leave
one
note
--
make
one
further
note
with
respect
to
this
issue
before
i
conclude,
and
it's
this.
this
is
not
a
case
like
the
barenblatt
case
where,
as
your
honors
may
recall,
there
had
been
sworn
testimony
by
others
putting
mr.
barenblatt
in
the
communist
party
or
at
least
indicating
that
mr.
barenblatt
had
participated
in
activities
of
the
communist
party.
there
was
no
sworn
testimony,
whatever,
with
respect
to
mr.liveright
prior
to
his
being
summoned
and,
so
far
as
we
know,
there
is,
to
this
date,
no
testimony
on
the
public
record
of
any
of
these
committees,
either
if
these
committees
whether
in
the
house
or
the
senate,
putting
mr.
barenblatt
--
mr.
liveright
in
the
communist
party
either
as
a
member
or
as
a
participant.
i
see
my
time
is
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
few
remarks
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
probable
cause,
i
think
we
ought
to
be
quite
plain
here
just
what
happened
in
this
case.
there
was
no
information
before
the
subcommittee
with
respect
to
this
petitioner
prior
to
his
summoning.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
so
far
as
we
know,
of
the
subcommittee
such
as
one
found
in
the
barenblatt
case
where
a
prior
witness
had
named
the
wit
--
this
particular
witness,
mr.
barenblatt,
on
the
one
case,
and
mr.
liveright
here,
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
a
participant.
what
mr.
doolittle
undoubtedly
had
in
mind
in
responding
to
the
chief
justice's
question
was
that
the
subcommittee
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
was
some
information
which
it
had
which
caused
it
to
summon
petitioner
but
there
was
none,
so
far
as
we
know,
so
far
as
been
disclosed
on
the
record
here.
mr.
morris,
at
the
trial,
testified
that
there
was
some
such
information.
we
sought
to
cross-examine.
we
sought
to
get
it
by
subpoena.
we
sought
to
get
it
by
direction
from
the
court.
we
were
denied
any
opportunity
to
cross-examine
as
to
the
information
or
to
get
it
by
direction
of
the
court.
we
did
not
waive
our
rights.
at
page
117
of
the
joint
appendix,
appears
our
request
made
to
the
court
after
mr.
morris
testified
that
he'd
be
directed
to
bring
the
information
in.
the
court
denied
that
request.
we
said
we
wanted
the
information
in
order
to
test
the
veracity
of
the
witness.
mr.
morris'
veracity
could
not
be
tested
by
us.
now,
in
response
--
with
reference
to
mr.
justice
whittaker's
reference
last
week
to
the
draper
and
caroll
cases,
let
me
make
it
plain.
that,
had
the
unnamed
informant
been
named,
had
we
then
had
an
opportunity
to
call
him,
it
may
well
be
that
we
could
not
have
asked
mr.
x
anything
relating
to
the
truth
of
the
information
he
had
presumably
given
mr.
morris.
it
may
well
be
that
the
competence
of
that
information
as
proof
of
guilt,
if
it
were,
of
the
petitioner
might
not
have
been
brought
in
issue,
but
we
certainly
should've
been
permitted
an
opportunity
to
test
whether
in
fact
mr.
morris
was
telling
the
truth,
whether
in
fact
there
was
such
information
communicated
to
him
by
telephone
and
in
meetings.
and,
if
there
was
some
information,
we
should've
been
given
an
opportunity
to
find
out
from
mr.
x,
the
unnamed
informant,
whether
this
was
the
liveright
whom
he
mentioned
when
he
talked
to
mr.
morris,
whether
perhaps
it
wasn't
another
liveright
that
he
had
in
mind.
this
is
what
we
were
denied.
we
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
test
the
existence
and
the
reliability
of
the
information
presumably
given
to
the
subcommittee,
not
its
competence
as
proof
of
guilt.
now,
if
we
are
not
going
to
be
given
that
right,
if
petitioners
in
these
cases
are
not
going
to
be
accorded
that
right,
then
any
investigation
of
any
person
can
be
justified
merely
on
the
ipso
dixit
of
a
chief
counsel
of
a
subcommittee
and
of
the
self-serving
avowal
by
a
committee
that
its
investigation
is
legitimate
and
bona
fide.
there
is
no
other
way
we
know
of
making
a
showing
such
as
today,
for
the
first
time,
not
on
their
briefs,
the
government
would
impose
on
petitioners
a
strong
and
substantial
showing
that
there
was
no
basis
for
the
calling
of
this
man.
we
don't
have
a
case
here,
such
as
mr.
shelton
fortunately
had,
where
someone
had
crossed
out
the
name
willard
and
written
in
the
name
robert.
we
have
a
case
here
where
the
subpoena
was
directed
toward
herman
liveright.
unless
we
are
given
an
opportunity
to
test
the
veracity
of
the
government's
witness
who
testified
in
chief
to
test
whether
in
fact
there
was
such
information
in
existence,
a
fundamental
question,
we
are
being
denied
the
rights
accorded
all
defendants
in
all
criminal
trials.
now,
turning
to
the
question
of
subject
matter
under
inquiry,
here
again,
as
mr.
fanelli
made
it
clear,
it
was
the
case
in
russell,
we
have
a
shifting
of
the
nature
of
subject
matter
under
inquiry
from
stage
to
stage
of
this
litigation.
and,
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
we
find
the
definition
of
delineation
of
subject
matter
that
you'll
find
in
the
brief.
you'll
see
it
nowhere
else
below.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
counsel
took
the
position
that
this
was
part
of
the
investigation
into
the
communist
infiltration
into
the
press.
here,
the
government,
apparently,
abandons
that
suggestion.
in
the
trial
court,
the
government
prosecutor
said
this.
he
said
the
powers
this
committee
had
on
the
business
it
was
investigating
was
the
entire
breadth
of
its
powers
under
resolution
366,
and
at
no
time
has
this
since
been
narrowed
down
to
any
particular
subject
such
as
a
topic
or
a
particular
geographic
location
or
a
particular
and
narrower
activity.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
matter
under
inquiry,
anything
more
narrow
than
the
full
powers
of
the
committee.
that
was
the
testimony
of
mr.
morris
that
apparently
was
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
because
the
trial
court
did
not
particularize
as
to
any
subject
matter,
although
it
found
the
indictment
questions
pertinent
to
the
“subject
matter
under
inquiry
before
the
committee
at
that
time.”
we
then
are
brought
back,
inevitably,
to
resolution
366,
this
broad
resolution,
this
vast
resolution
about
which
i
know
no
better
characterization
than
that
offered
by
one
of
the
champions
of
this
subcommittee
--
the
internal
security
subcommittee.
its
former
chairman,
senator
jenner,
who
certainly
knows,
more
than
i
do,
what
the
subcommittee
was
engaging
in,
in
the
years
when
senator
jenner
was
a
member
and
a
chairman
of
the
subcommittee.
and,
senator
jenner,
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
as
we
quote
him
in
our
brief,
had
this
to
say
about
the
powers
of
this
subcommittee,
about
the
resolution
366.
he
said
resolution
366
authorizes
the
subcommittee
to
look
after
the
internal
security
of
the
united
states,
but
it
must
be
realized
that
it
is
hard
to
draw
a
line
indicating
where
the
subject
begins
and
where
it
ends,
and
i
suggest
that
if
senator
jenner,
a
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that
is
in
our
brief,
and
that
--
it's
in
our
brief
in
the
quotations
in
our
brief.
i
don't
know
at
what
page
but
this
is
100
congressional
record
843.
and,
if
senator
jenner,
himself,
could
not
determine
where
the
subject
began
and
where
it
ended,
i
suggest
that
mr.
herman
liveright,
a
mere
layman,
likewise,
should
not
be
required
to
have
determine
where
the
subject
began
or
where
it
ended
and
i
suggest
that
a
trial
court,
in
measuring
the
necessity
for
calling
a
witness
before
it
as
against
his
rights
to
remain
silent,
could
not
determine
where
the
subject
began
and
where
it
ended,
particularly
when
the
government
refused
to
say
at
the
trial.
thank
you.
