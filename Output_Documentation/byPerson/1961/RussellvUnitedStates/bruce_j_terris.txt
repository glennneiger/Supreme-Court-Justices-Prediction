mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
which
is
the
last
of
the
cases
which
should
--
which
are
being
argued
in
these
series
of
six
contempt
of
congress
cases.
in
the
appendix,
we
have
set
forth
principal
contentions
made
by
both
various
petitioners
in
the
six
cases,
and
by
the
government,
and
the
places
in
the
briefs
where
these
contentions
are
made.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
gojack,
number
128.
it's
the
last
–
it's
the
last
page
that
folds
out.
as
it
can
readily
be
seen
from
the
appendix,
many
of
the
contentions
are
repeated
often
several
times
in
the
different
cases
both
by
the
petitioners
and
by
the
government.
and
in
order
to
avoid
constant
repetition,
my
colleagues
and
myself
have
divided
the
legal
arguments
which
do
not
depend
primarily
on
the
various
facts
of
the
different
cases
between
ourselves.
i
will
cover
the
issue.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
all
--
the
only
--
only
point
i'm
making
is
that
i'd
like
to
divide
three
--
three
of
the
arguments,
the
legal
arguments
which
don't
depend
on
the
--
on
the
facts
of
the
--
of
the
different
cases
between
ourselves,
so
that
we
don't
repeat
in
each
of
the
cases
in
which
there
are
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
only
point
i
was
making
was
that
it
--
i'm
sorry,
if
you
have
the
appendix
before
you,
you
would
make
it
a
little
easier
to
point
out
just
which
of
the
issues
were
divided.
that's
all
your
honor.
we're
not
making
any
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
substantive
contention
from
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
from
the
appendix.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
sir.
the
difficulty
was,
your
honor,
we
didn't
know
all
the
contentions
that
we're
going
to
make
either
ourselves
or
with
the
various
petitioners.
i
will
cover
the
issue
whether
the
committee
--
whether
a
congressional
committee
must
have
probable
cause
in
order
to
subpoena
a
witness
to
testify
before
it.
and
i
also
hope
at
the
end
of
my
argument
to
discuss
the
contention
that
the
indictments
were
invalid,
because
they
failed
to
specify
the
precise
subject
under
inquiry.
mr.
maroney
will
argue
the
--
the
issue
whether
the
indictments
were
invalid
because
the
government
employees
on
the
grand
jury
are
alternatively
whether
the
petitioners
in
these
various
cases
were
entitled
to
hearing.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
that
will
be
in
--
that
will
be
in
the
russell
case,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
russell
case
is
the
second
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
russell
case
your
honor
is
the
second
case
and
mr.
raul
(ph)
in
his
brief
also
says
that
he
will
leave
his
argument
on
that
issue
to
the
russell
case
and
then
we
have
--
and
we
have
done
the
same
here
of
course
as
it
mentioned
in
oral
argument
or
in
his
brief
except
for
the
rely
on
the
brief
in
the
russell
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
russell
case
is
the
second
one,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
according
to
the
--
to
the
substantive
contentions
which
are
made
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
and
the
one
which
is
relied
on
entirely
in
oral
argument
and
almost
entirely
in
his
brief.
and
that
is
his
contention
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated
because
the
subcommittee
did
not
have
probable
cause
in
order
to
sub
--
to
subpoena
him
to
appear
before
it.
we
submit
first,
the
petitioner
cannot
raise
this
contention
since
he
did
not
make
it
at
the
time
he
appeared
before
the
subcommittee.
in
our
view,
a
witness
before
a
congressional
committee
can
raise
its
trial
for
contempt
only
the
issues
which
he
raises
before
the
committee
itself.
and
we
believe
that
the
only
exceptions
concern
the
elements
of
the
crime
which
the
government
must
prove
of
course
at
the
trial
for
contempt
whether
the
witness
raises
them
before
the
congressional
committee
or
he
does
not.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
are
as
a
matter
of
practice.
his
witnesses,
i
think
almost
100%
of
them
do
have
a
lawyer
with
them.
and
of
course
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
did
a
very
distinguished
lawyer.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
presumably,
if
the
witness
does
not
expect
to
--
to
answer
all
the
questions,
he
will
bring
a
lawyer.
but
this
--
this
contention
which
i've
just
made
is
not
--
is
not
a
novel
one.
it
has
been
held
in
numerous
decisions
by
this
court,
only
last
term
on
the
deutch
case.this
court,
we
believe,
made
the
exact
distinction
between
elements
of
the
crime
and
other
issues,
because
in
the
deutch
case,
the
court
held
as
it
earlier
held
in
the
barenblatt
case
that
a
witness
cannot
raise
at
his
trial
for
contempt
the
issue
that
he
was
not
apprised
of
the
pertinency
of
the
questions,
unless
he
questions
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
when
he
appears
before
the
committee.
and
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
deutch
case,
the
court
held
that
since
the
contempt
of
congress
statute
explicitly
provides
that
the
gov
--
that
the
questions
must
be
pertinent
but
the
government
is
required
to
prove
the
actual
pertinency
of
the
questions
to
the
subject
under
inquiry,
even
though
the
witness
makes
no
objection
on
the
ground
of
pertinency
when
he
appears
before
the
committee.
i
like
to
develop
this
contention
at
some
length
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
assume
the
latter,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
in
--
in
our
view,
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
--
on
the
kind
of
committee
here
and
i'd
say
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
--
i
suppose
that
ultimately
we
come
down
squarely
on
the
whole
line
of
cases
which
this
--
which
this
court
has
decided.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
your
honor.
we
get
in
reference
--
in
reference
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
will
say
the
most
of
the
cases
do
involve
the
un-american
activities
committee
because
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
area
of
course
where
the
litigation
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
has
a
reason.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
of
course
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
of
course
the
rationale
for
--
for
requiring
the
witness
to
raise
his
objections
is
that
even
--
even
if
the
committee
has
satisfied
objections
which
he
later
may
set
a
trial,
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
he
would
not
have
testified.
he
would
have
been
in
contempt
anyway.
and
this
rationale
is
--
is
explained
very
clearly
in
the
bryan
case
in
339
united
states
which
involved
the
question
of
a
quorum.
and
there,
the
court
held
that
a
witness
could
not
raise
the
issue
of
a
lack
of
a
quorum
when
he
was
tried
for
contempt,
when
he
did
not
raise
this
issue
before
the
committee.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
insofar
as
my
--
this
discussion
of
course
is
a
procedural
question,
and
this
as
to
whether
a
witness
must
raise
before
the
committee
itself
his
objections.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
know.
and
when
i
say
“the
committee”
i
didn't
mean
this
committee.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
a
committee,
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
to
rephrase
my
statement,
we
think
that
a
witness
before
any
congressional
committee
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
must
raise
his
objections
if
he's
going
to
rely
on
these
objections
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
may
well
be
your
honor
that
the
--
that
they
waive
their
rights
if
they
--
if
they
don't
bring
a
lawyer
and
therefore
--
did
not
know
with
them.
but
that
is
the
holding
of
--
of
this
court
in
numerous
cases.
as
i
say,
before
grand
juries
for
example
in
hale
and
henkel,
the
court
held
that
a
witness
at
his
trial
for
contempt
couldn't
argue
that
he
couldn't
produce
the
documents
because
he
haven't
said
this
when
he
--
was
asked
for
the
documents
at
--
at
that
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that's
right
your
honor.
but
the
exception
which
i've
indicated
of
elements
of
the
crime
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
is
certainly
--
that's
one
of
the
theories.
the
bryan
case
has
two
theories.
that
is
one
of
them.
the
second
one
is
that
he
--
that
the
witness
would
not
have
testified
or
produced
the
documents
even
if
the
committee
had
--
had
rectified
the
--
the
situation
because
he
relied
on
entirely
different
contentions.
and
that
of
course
applies
regardless
of
whether
it's
the
kind
of
objection
which
can
be
rectified.
for
example,
in
the
ollman
case
which
concerned
a
grand
jury,
this
court
gave
the
--
a
very
summarily
dismissed
first
amendment
contentions
which
i
assume
would
have
been
very
hard
to
rectify
in
the
ground
that
they
were
not
raised
at
the
time
that
the
witness
was
asked
to
testify.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
could
not
have
been
rectified
or
it
could
have
been
rectified.
well,
they
could
have
explained
to
the
witness
the
--
the
information
for
which
the
basis
which
they
had
call
them.
they
presumably
could
not
--
if
i
understand
mr.
rauh's
contention
correctly,
he
thinks
that
even
if
this
evidence
had
been
explained
to
the
witness
that
it
would
not
have
been
sufficient.
of
course,
we
disagree
with
that.
in
this
contention
which
we
--
which
i've
just
made
concerning
the
fourth
amendment,
was
applied
by
this
court
in
the
mcfall
case
only
last
term.
and
there,
the
witness
contended
that
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
and
this
court
held
that
if
the
witness
“was
in
doubt
as
to
what
records
were
required
by
the
subpoena
or
founded
unduly
burdensome
and
founded
to
call
for
records
unrelated
to
the
inquiry.
he
could
and
should
if
so
advice
the
subcommittee
the
court
then
cited
the
bryan
case
which
of
course
stands
for
this
precise
proposition.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
go
--
your
honor,
we
do
think
that
he
has
to
raise
all
his
objections
which
are
not
elements
to
the
crime.
however,
i'm
addressing
myself
to
your
point,
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
gives
him
information.
i
don't
think
he
gives
him
anymore
information
than
this
subpoena
does.
it
tells
him
what
records
to
produce,
but
it
doesn't
tell
what
basis
that
--
that
request
is
made.
i
think
those
two
situations
are
--
are
virtually
identical.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
and
of
course
--
we
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
you
honor,
we
think
that
--
that
--
that
if
anything
the
congressional
committee
has
bro
--
has
broader
power
to
have
inquiry
then
it
would
be
an
ordinary
case
in
the
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
except
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
of
course,
this
court
is
required
that
before
a
witness
has
to
answer,
he
has
to
be
told
what
the
subject
under
inquiry
is
if
he's
in
doubt.
so
before
he
makes
any
answer,
he
is
told
just
as
clearly,
perhaps
more
clearly
and
probably
more
clearly
than
he
would
in
a
criminal
case
where
the
indictment
may
frame
the
outside
limits
of
what
he
might
be
asked,
but
he
certainly
has
no
real
idea
of
what's
going
to
be
in
the
imagination
if
he's
the
prosecutor,
the
defense
attorney,
certainly
on
cross-examination.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
of
course
the
questions
have
to
be
within
the
authorizing
resolution
of
the
committee
at
first.
second,
they
have
to
be
within
whatever
subject
under
inquiry
as
stated
to
it,
so
there
are
very
definite
limitations
on
what
kinds
of
questions
can
be
asked.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
whether
the
petitioner
did
raise
the
fourth
amendment
contention
because
mr.
rauh
seems
to
think
that
the
government
is
in
--
inconsistent
on
this
point
in
--
in
its
brief.
first
of
all,
the
fourth
amendment
is
never
mentioned
by
the
petitioner
either
in
a
--
during
his
testimony
executive
session
or
in
public
session.
now
the
closest
he
comes
are
two
statements,
one
which
is
on
page
84
of
the
record
and
the
other
is
on
page
89.
on
page
84
of
the
record,
the
petitioner
says,
"i
failed
to
see
why
i'm
involved
in
this
hearing
which
the
chairman
said
wednesday
stems
from
the
burdett
testimony."
and
then
on
page
89
in
his
prepared
memorandum
objecting
to
the
hearing,
petitioner
says,
"i'm
involved
in
these
hearings
as
a
victim
of
accident."
and
then
he
goes
on
to
explain
on
the
same
paragraph
that
the
committee
had
no
basis
for
subpoenaing
him.
and
this
contention
concludes
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
paragraph
by
saying,
"it
appears
to
be
just
another
step
in
the
campaign
to
discredit
the
paper
for
which
i
work."
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
second
--
the
second
group
of
quotation
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
rather
was
page
89
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
from
the
record.
89.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
the
first
was
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
89.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
think
that
these
contentions
are
clearly
part
of
petitioner's
first
amendment
arguments
which
he
made
very
strongly
at
the
executive
sessions,
repeated
in
the
public
session
and
all
through
the
judicial
proceedings.
we
agreed
that
the
petitioner
does
raise
the
issue
of
probable
cause
under
the
first
amendment.
and
i
think
perhaps
that's
the
difficulty
that
--
between
the
government
and
mr.
rauh.
we
agreed
that
he
raised
the
first
amendment
contention
including
this
probable
cause,
but
we
think
that
there's
a
substantial
difference
or
there
maybe
a
substantial
difference
between
what
the
first
amendment
requires
and
the
fourth
amendment
requires,
assuming
as
mr.
rauh
does
that
the
fourth
amendment
would
require
the
same
re
--
with
the
same
kind
of
proof
in
order
to
call
a
witness
before
a
congressional
committee
as
it
would
be
necessary
for
a
police
officer
to
make
an
arrest
to
research.
now,
of
course,
we
don't,
we
don't
agree
with
that
statement
of
a
substantive
law.but
if
that
--
but
if
mr.
rauh
is
correct
on
that
proposition.
then
there
is
a
substantial
difference,
we
believe,
between
the
first
amendment
and
fourth
amendment
requirements.
at
the
least,
we
think
petitioners
vague
objection
which
does
not
even
mentioned
the
fourth
amendment.
it's
not
the
kind
of
clear
unambiguous
objection
which
this
court
required
in
deutch
and
barenblatt
cases
in
order
to
raise
issues
before
a
congressional
committee.
i
now
would
like
to
consider
petitioner's
contention
assuming
that
he
did
properly
raise
the
fourth
amendment
before
the
--
before
the
subcommittee.
in
here,
our
argument
is
two-fold.
first
of
all,
we
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
the
subpoenas
to
testify,
while
this
court
is
held
in
several
cases
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply
to
subpoena
duces
tecum.
we
know
of
no
case
and
petitioner
has
cited
no
case,
indicating
to
certainly
holding
if
the
fourth
amendment
applied
the
subpoenas
to
testify.
the
barenblatt,
the
wilkinson
and
braden
cases,
do
mention
probable
cause,
but
read
in
context,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
they
mentioned
probable
cause
as
part
of
their
discussion
of
the
first
amendment
and
whether
the
committee
has
a
val
--
has
a
valid
legislative
purpose.and
--
and
though
petitioner
cites
numerous
american
and
english
cases,
and
the
long
history
of
arrest,
searches
and
seizures,
we
think
that
they
show
merely
as
we
of
course
agree
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
arrest
and
searches.
we
think
there's
a
marked
difference
between
arrests
and
searches
and
testifying
before
a
congressional
committee.
and
our
second
contention
is
that
even
if
the
fourth
amendment
did
apply
the
subpoenas
to
testify,
that
it
was
not
violated
in
this
case.
it
seems
clear
that
if
the
fourth
amendment
applies
at
all,
it
requires
the
congressional
committee
to
have
considerably
less
information
in
order
to
subpoena
a
witness
to
--
either
to
testify
or
to
produce
documents
than
as
required
for
officers
to
make
an
arrest
or
search.
for
if
the
results
that
a
search
or
arrest
is
without
basis,
personal
rights
are
very
substantially
injured.
on
the
other
hand,
if
a
congressional
committee
subpoenas
a
person
who
turns
out
to
have
no
information
on
the
subject
which
is
under
inquiry,
the
witness
presumably
will
simply
answer
that
he
has
no
information.
we
do
not
to
--
any
vitally
important
interest
is
thereby
violated.
this
distinction
between
the
standard
of
probable
cause
to
be
applied
under
the
first
amendment,
the
subpoenas
has
a
contrast
to
that
applied
to
arrest
and
searches,
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
at
least
two
cases.
in
the
oklahoma
press
publishing
company
case
versus
walling,
which
is
in
327
united
states,
this
court
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply
to
subpoena
duces
tecum
issued
by
executive
agencies.
but
the
court
held
that
probable
cause
is
satisfied
in
that
circumstance
if
“the
investigation
is
authorized
by
congress,
is
for
a
purpose
congress
can
order
and
the
documents
sought
are
relevant
to
the
inquiry.”
and
a
similar
standard
was
applied
to
subpoena
duces
tecum
--
to
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
in
hale
v.
hankel.
we
think
that
there
is
no
possible
reason
to
apply
a
stricter
standard
to
subpoenas
to
testify
than
to
subpoenas
duces
tecum
even
if
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
subpoenas
to
testify
at
all.
and
if
anything,
the
standards
should
be
less
strict
as
to
subpoenas
issued
by
a
congressional
committee
than
by
an
executive
agency.
now
tying
the
standards
which
were
laid
down
by
this
court
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
oklahoma
press
case
to
the
situation
here,
the
barenblatt
case
establishes
that
congress
has
the
power
to
investigate
communist
activities.
as
we
will
show
in
the
liveright
case,
this
investigation
was
within
the
authority
conferred
on
the
internal
security
subcommittee
by
the
congress.
and
as
i
hope
to
show
later,
the
questions
which
petitioner
refused
to
answer
were
relevant,
that
is,
they
were
pertinent
to
the
investigation
of
communist
activities.
and
for
these
reasons
we
think
that
if
the
fourth
amendment
applies
at
all,
that
it
was
satisfied
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
the
injury
certainly
would
not
be
nearly
as
grave
as
when
a
person
is
illegally
arrested,
his
home
is
illegally
searched.
congress
for
example
could
--
has
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
assume
by
your
question
to
what
did
--
that
you
think
the
implication,
the
possible
implication
that
the
public
would
read
--
would
get
from
that
kind
of
a
question
even
though
it
was
answered
by
--
by
“no”
is
that
this
man
was
a
communist.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
without
even
calling
him,
the
congressional
committee
could
put
out
a
report
that
said
he
was
a
communist
and
presumably,
he
would
have
no
legal
recourse.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
the
theory
in
this
kind
of
situation
--
they
asked
him
a
question
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think,
maybe
one
of
the
problems
we're
having
is
that
we
do
--
we
do
not
make
the
contention
that
a
person
can
be
asked
a
question,
“are
you
a
communist?”
with
absolutely
no
basis.
we
think
the
court
has
suggested
it.
it
is
not
held
but
it
is
suggested
in
the
barenblatt
and
the
wilkinson
and
braden
cases,
that
there
has
to
be
some
basis
for
asking
that
kind
of
a
question.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
our
contention
is
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
you
mean
was
it
was
a'pplied
to
petitioner?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
just
any
idea
of
some
--
we
say
that
this
court
has
suggested,
it
is
not
held
but
it's
suggested
there
has
to
be
some
basis
to
ask
any
witness
including
mr.
shelton.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
think
that
that's
what
this
court
has
suggested.
we
have
not
argued
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
the
contrary.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
does
not
held
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
contention
which
we
are
making
here
is
that
we
have
satisfied,
that
the
--
that
the
committee
satisfied
the
standards
which
this
court
suggested
in
the
barenblatt,
wilkinson
and
braden
cases.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
i
--
i
think
this
court's
holdings
on
the
three
cases
i've
mentioned
do
indicate
that
since
you
are
balancing
various
factors
in
weighing
the
public
and
private
interests
involved
that
it
is
relevant.
what
kind
of
a
--
of
a
public
interest,
the
governmental
interest
is
--
is
involved?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
for
that
reason
cause
--
and
for
that
reason
cause
does
have
--
certainly
it's
irrelevant.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
correct
your
honor
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
alright
now
--
now
what
kind
of
a
showing
do
you
think
must
be
made
to
justify
it?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
one
of
the
difficulties
we
have
with
mr.
rauh's
that
i
think
in
verbal
form,
it
doesn't
appear
that
there's
much
difference
between
our
two
standards.
we
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
basis
but
a
basis
that
a
reasonable
man
could
form
a
judgment
on.
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
the
witness
has
information
which
is
a
value
to
the
committee,
that
is,
whatever
it
is
investigating
of
a
particular
time.
now,
mr.
rauh
seems
to
have
phrased
in
terms
of
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
witness
has
information.
in
braden
case,
this
court
held
the
probable
cause
and
reasonable
ground
mean
the
same
thing,
so
i
--
i
think
probably
the
--
certainly
in
verbal
terms,
we're
very
close
to
being
in
agreement.
he's
also
said
that
our
argument
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
likelihood.
i'm
not
quite
sure
even
how
--
what's
the
difference
of
this
between
a
likelihood
and
a
reasonable
basis.
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
think
that
is
the
--
that
is
really
the
main
disagreement
that
we
have
with
the
petitioner,
not
--
not
so
much
--
what
the
--
how
much
information,
but
whether
the
--
whether
the
courts
are
supposed
to
have
a
full
review
of
the
information
which
is
presented.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
let
--
let
me
--
let
me
--
let
me
talk
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
because
that
--
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
--
why
i
do
--
that
of
course
is
phrased
much
better
than
i
would
have.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
barenblatt
case
results
are
ultimately
in
that
--
in
that
kind
of
thing,
the
witness
can
be
asked
questions
and
whether
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
my
difficulty
your
honor
is
--
is
whether
--
that
--
that
statement
can
mean
any
type
of
harm.
i
think
that's
what
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
chief
justice
was
--
was
directing
himself
to
and
we
--
and
the
--
in
barenblatt
and
then
again
in
wilkinson
and
braden,
the
court
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
there
is
no
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
of
course
i
do
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
think
that
the
--
that
the
committee
at
the
trial
for
contempt,
has
to
present
the
basis
on
which
it
--
it
exercise
its
judgment
to
subpoena
the
witness.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
and
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
--
and
mr.
rauh
has
never
argued
that
they
were
required
at
that
point
to
present
their
evidence.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
he
--
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
there
may
be
a
new
(voice

--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
i
wouldn't
quite
phrase
it
that
way.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
is
not
--
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
an
element
of
the
crime.
we
think
this
court
has
indicated
in
barenblatt
and
then
wilkinson
and
braden.
that
it's
one
of
the
considerations
to
be
weighed
in
considering
the
witness'
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
at
the
trial
(voice

--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
trial.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
--
as
part
of
proof
that
you
--
in
part
--
it
is
part
of
considering
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
governmental
interest
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
think
that's
would
--
mr.
rauh's
contention
is,
because
i
think
that
if
he
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that's
difficult
if
--
if
i
--
if
i
said
that
that
was
all
that
we
have
to
overcome
then
presumably
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
wouldn't
but
--
but
beyond
that,
i
think
we
have
a
much
simpler
answer
and
that
is
that
watkins
and
barenblatt
hold
that
we
cannot
look
into
the
motives
of
the
members
of
congressional
committees,
that's
the
reason
i
do
not
want
to
answer
it
quite
so
simply
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
you
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
(voice
overlap)
he
assumes
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that's
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
as
i
say,
i
think
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
quite
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
we
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honors,
in
--
in
our
view,
the
precise
question
is
how
far
the
courts
are
going
--
going
to
interfere
if
you
will
restrict
congressional
inquiries.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
is
a
--
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
of
course
there's
judicial
review
of
that
too.
presumably
this
--
presumably,
congress
couldn't
put
somebody
in
jail
itself
if
it
had
no
probable
cause.
if
it
could
not
put
them
in
jail
through
the
use
of
the
court
(voice

--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
assume
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
which
method.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
the
power
of
the
court's
that
we
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
the
--
the
power
of
this
court
to
review
the
contempt
proceedings
in
the
--
in
the
congress
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
has
been
adjudicated
--
mr.
bruce
j.

yes,
in
kilbourn
and
thompson.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
it
--
it
isn't
adjudication
that
there
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
they
can
go
to
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
congress
that
time
was
(voice

power.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
are
--
i
have
to
come
back
to
--
in
our
view
although
the
power
to
the
--
to
the
individual
maybe
greater
since
he
will
be
--
he
could
conceivably
confined.
i
think
it's
for
five
years
your
honor,
but
could
be
confined
for
a
longer
period
than
the
--
than
the
senator
or
the
house
could
confine
that
still
the
--
if
this
court
lays
down
a
rule
of
probable
cause
under
the
fourth
amendment
as
mr.
rauh
contends,
it
would
be
a
serious
limitation
on
the
power
of
congress.
we
think
this
is
the
--
is
the
essential
question
in
this
case,
just
to
what
extent
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
if
--
if
the
congress
cannot
compel
testimony,
if
it
cannot
compel
testimony,
obviously,
it
very
seriously
interferes
with
it
--
with
its
power
to
investigate.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
the
proce
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
procedural
requirements
of
the
bill
of
rights
as
they
apply
to
courts
are,
at
least
do
not
in
terms
apply
to
congress
in
--
in
the
full
panoply
of
them.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
precisely
my
view,
the
holding
of
kilbourn
and
thompson
--
thompson
that
there
is
this
kind
of
judicial
review.
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
the
probable
cause
applies
here
in
a
different
fashion,
i
think
the
issue
would
be
the
same
if
the
procedure
was
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
suggested.
and
we
were
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
what
we
have
here,
we're
into
trial.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
think
the
rule
would
be
the
same
though
if
he'd
been
tried
by
the
senate.
we
think
that
he
would
have
been
required
--
the
senate
would
not
have
to
have
listened
to
any
fourth
amendment
contention
if
he
had
not
made
it
at
the
time
he
refused
to
answer
before
the
committee.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris

we
think
(voice

mr.

you

you

there
was

on

on

you
mean
like
he

i'm
just
--
he
was
interrogated
the
way,
maybe
police
officers
might
do
under

for
long
periods
of
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
in
that
kind
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
one
very
well
might
say
that
if
he
--
he's
been
coerced
that
he
--
he's
also
being
coerced
into
not
making
his
objections,
i
mean
here
--
he's
quite
free
to
make
his

objections.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce

if
a
man
is
under
coercion,
i
don't
think

he
can
be
compelled
to
raise
all
kinds
of
legal
objections

during
this
coercion.

mr.

douglas,
i
wanted
to
correct

misstatement
i
have
made.
the
statute
says
he
can
be
punished
for
--
for
one
year
so
that
the
--
the
actual
amount
of
punishment
is
not
too
much
greater
than
what
congress
could
also
impose,
of
course,
there
might
be
consecutive
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
sentences
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
conceivable,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
correct
sir.
with
only
one
limitation
of
course,
the
yates
case
says
that
if
they
lay
out
a
whole
area
in
which
they
will
not
answer,
they
can
only
be
convicted
for
one
contempt
but
the
--
but
that's
quite
true.
if
they
only
refuse
to
answer
a
series
of
questions
without
any
area
being
laid
out,
they
can
be
--
receive
consecutive
sentences.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
mr.
shelton
did
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
the
yates
case,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
your
honor,
you
did.
i
--
i
think
we're
talking
about
the
same
case.
it's
the
yates
case
and
--
and
you
said
there
can
only
be
one
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
(voice
overlap)
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
first
time
that
it
was
here,
you
threw
out
11
out
of
the
12
specifications
of
contempt
for
this
very
reason
that
she
had
laid
out
an
area
which
you
would
refuse
to
answer.
and
that
therefore
her
separate
refusals
were
not
contempt.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
--
what
is
the
precise
issue
in
this
case
and
with
which
mr.
rauh
emphasizes
so
strongly
and
that
is
whether
he
is
entitled
to
the
letter
which
is
the
basis
on
which
the
subcommittee
questioned
mr.
shelton.
in
our
view,
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
letter
because
he
--
because
he
is
not
entitled
to
plenary
judicial
review
of
the
basis
on
which
the
committee
subpoenaed
him.
we
think
that
there
is
--
that
this
court
did
not
hold
in
the
wilkinson
case,
braden
or
barenblatt
that
this
was
to
be
an
element
of
the
offense.
it
was
to
be
tried
just
like
any
other
element
of
offense.
we
think
that
--
that
all
the
court
suggested
there
and
that's
all
it
was,
is
a
suggestion,
is
that
the
committee
had
to
show
that
they
had
some
basis,
a
reasonable
basis
in
order
--
in
order
to
subpoena
him.
he
do
not
think
that
this
means
that
the
witness
has
--
can
put
the
committee
to
the
choice
that
is
of
either
not
forcing
him
to
testify
or
of
producing
confidential
information
and
although
mr.
rauh
seems
to
think
that
this
is
not
confidential
information,
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that
that
--
that
that
is
exactly
what
it
is.
was
signed
by
a
pseudonym,
it
had
--
it
--
it
apparently
had
considerable
other
information
on
other
persons
that
leaves
information
about
communist
party
activities.
and
it
was
precisely
the
kind
of
confidential
information
which
--
which
the
congress
would
of
course
not
be
very
willing
to
give
up
so
if
--
if
mr.
rauh
is
correct,
he
--
he
is
putting
the
committee
in
the
--
in
a
precise
situation
of
either
not
being
able
to
compel
and
to
testify
or
giving
up
important
confidential
information.
now,
in
the
other
cases,
two
of
the
other
cases
which
are
being
argued
in
these
series,
similar
contentions
are
made
and
they're
the
--
and
they're
the
petitioners
that
were
argued,
but
they're
entitled
to
all
materials
in
the
files
of
the
committee.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
he
did
say
that,
we
think
in
regard
to
the
first
amendment,
yes
sir.
well
i
think
--
i
mean
this
is
a
bunch
of
--
i
was
called
here
by
accident
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
it
makes
essentially
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
he
--
he
could
refuse
to
answer
of
course
and
if
--
and
if
this
court
held
that
his
first
amendment
rights
were
violated
because
the
committee
had
no
basis
for
questioning
him
then
he
would
--
then
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
of
course
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
he
couldn't
be
convicted.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
thought
i
might
be
able
to
make
my
answer
a
little
--
a
little
stronger.
in
watkins
and
barenblatt,
the
court
held
that
you
had
to
apprise
the
witness
of
the
subject
under
inquiry
in
the
pertinency
of
the
questions.
but
that
is
required
by
the
statute,
the
statute
says
that
--
that
you
have
--
that
the
question
has
to
be
pertinent.
and
this
court
held
that
the
only
way
a
witness
could
figure
out
for
himself
whether
--
whether
he
--
he
was
in
violation
of
the
statute,
was
that
--
that
they
tell
him
what
the
subject
was
and
the
pertinency
of
the
question.
now
before
--
now,
we
think
that
the
probable
cause
or
reasonable
grounds
or
however
you
wanted
to
phrase
it
but
that
consideration,
it's
just
one
of
the
considerations
which
are
involved
in
the
first
amendment
contentions.
now,
would
the
committee
have
to
say
--
go
through
the
kind
of
discussion
which
this
court
made
in
the
barenblatt
case
about
the
great
national
interest
in
--
in
protecting
the
--
against
subversion
that
--
that
they
had
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
it's
another
one
of
the
considerations
under
the
first
amendment
in
barenblatt.
if
--
if
the
witnesses
entitled
to
this
kind
of
an
explanation
when
he
objects
on
the
grounds
of
the
first
amendment
that
the
committee
goes
through
the
whole
first
amendment
contention.
obviously,
the
--
there's
going
to
be
--
it's
going
to
be
quite
--
quite
a
procedure
before
the
committee,
it's
not
quite
the
same
thing
when
you
ask,
"what's
the
subject?"
and
they
say,
“the
subject
is
communist
activities
in
news
media."
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
probably
not,
your
honor.
we
--
that
isn't
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
we
put
--
we
--
we
think
it
has
to
make
a
description
of
some
of
the
--
of
the
materials.
what
that
his
--
if
he's
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
he
attended
communist
meetings
of
some
kind
of
a
description
with
all
of
that
kind.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
we
--
we
think
that,
that
kind
of
evidence
is
sufficient
in
itself.
now
they
can
ask
questions
as
they
did
here."
how
long
ago
since
you've
seen
the
letter?
do
you
remember
precisely
what
it
--
what
it
says
here?"
they
can
ask
that
kind
of
question.
we
think
that
they
cannot
go
into
the
files
of
the
committee
either
by
a
subpoena
or
by
cross-examination.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
think
that's
true
your
honor.
now,
i
would
like
to
rely
in
part
on
the
barenblatt
case.
there,
the
court
--
there
the
court
said,
"in
--
in
discussing
this
issue,
the
one
sentence
which
is
on
probable
cause
nor
the
petitioner's
appearance,
as
a
witness,
follow
from
indiscriminate
dragging
of
procedures,
lacking
improbable
cause
for
belief
that
he
possessed
information
which
might
be
helpful
to
the
subcommittee."
and
then
it
dropped
a
footnote
to
support
this
--
this
statement.
and
the
footnote
says,
see
page
124
and
note
24.
now
on
page
124,
all
that
is
there
is
the
--
is
the
courts
answer
to
the
petitioner's
contention
that
the
questions
weren't
relevant.
the
court
says
the
questions
were
relevant.
we
think
the
questions
are
relevant
here.
and
then
at
note
24
--
note
24
contains
a
statement
by
the
chairman
that
the
evidence
or
information
contained
in
the
files
of
this
committee,
some
of
them
in
the
nature
of
evidence
shows
clearly
that
the
witness
has
information
about
communist
activities
in
the
united
states
of
america,
particularly
while
he
attended
the
university
of
michigan.
so,
that's
what
the
court
relied
on
in
barenblatt
for
showing
whatever
cause
must
be
shown.
now,
that
--
that
statement
is
considerably
less
detailed
than
the
statement
that
we
have
here.
at
least
this
identifies
the
source
in
general
terms
of
the
information.
it
doesn't
identify
the
particular
person
or
it
doesn't
show
the
letter
but
it
--
more
than
saying
we
have
something
in
our
files.
so
we
--
so
we
think
we've
gone
beyond
what
the
court
has
already
suggested
in
barenblatt.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
they
do
not.
and
of
--
and
of
course
we
would
--
we
would
say
that
it's
not
a
point
because
this
isn't
an
element
of
defense,
i
mean
we
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
--
no
it
would
not
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
quite
--
quite
correct,
your
honor.
now,
petitioner
seems
to
think
that
there's
either
an
--
an
all
or
nothing
proposition.
either
he's
entitled
to
completely
view
just
as
if
he
would
be
entitled
to
review
of
any
other
--
of
any
element
of
the
crime,
whether
he
answered
the
questions,
whether
the
questions
were
pertinent
or
--
or
he
says,
"then
there's
no
review
at
all."
and
therefore,
the
committee
can
cuff
him
off
the
street.
our
contention
falls
in
the
middle.
we
do
not
say
that
they
can
call
anybody
off
the
street.
that
is
not
our
contention.
when
we're
put
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights,
i
--
i
want
to
limit
that
very
clearly
to
that
because
that's
what
the
area
that
this
court
has
considered
the
question
in.
and
we
say,
what
the
committee
must
do
is
it
must
come
forward
either
with
sworn
testimony
and
this
was
sworn
testimony
by
an
official
of
the
committee
or
by
documentary
evidence
to
show
what
basis
they
have
for
questioning
the
witness.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
quite
correct,
your
honor.
not
in
the
--
not
the
full
kind
of
review
that
would
be
required
for
an
element
of
the
offense.
now,
this
is
--
for
example
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
quite
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
of
course
the
judge
(voice
overlap)
doesn't
have
to
believe
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
there's
--
that's
--
we
--
we
rely
on
the
--
on
the
strong
presumption
which
this
court
recognized
in
barenblatt
that
congress
is
--
is
pursuing
a
valid
purpose.
now,
there
the
question
was
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
this
court
made
quite
clear,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
not
look
into
the
files
of
the
committee
to
see
whether
there
wasn't
a
resolution
which
said,
"we
don't
want
this
man
to
testify
because
we
think
he
has
information,
we
just
want
him
to
testify,
because
we
want
him
to
be
fired
from
his
job."
now
there
may
well
be
that
kind
of
a
resolution
in
the
files
of
a
--
of
a
committee.
this
court
said
it
wouldn't
look
into
that,
it
wouldn't
--
it
would
start
with
the
presumption,
the
very
strong
presumption
that
there
was
a
valid
legislative
purpose
but
that
wasn't
a
consideration
of
a
constitutional
issue,
too.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
i
--
i
wouldn't
quite
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
do
not
have
to
apprise
and
that's
right.
mr.
rauh
has
never
made
the
contention
that
they
do.
he's
never
made
the
con
--
the
contention
that
they
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
he
--
well
he
--
i
think
yesterday,
he
did
suggest
for
the
first
time
that
possibly,
that
they
had
to
do
it
--
they
had
to
tell
him
at
that
time
but
i
--
when
i
say
never,
certainly
not
up
to
this
court
and
i
think
not
in
any
document
he's
filed.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
--
your
honor
they
could
--
they
could
do
that
even
if
there
--
if
there
was
a
requirement
that
they
have
to
apprise
him.
they
could
say
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
that
--
that's
true
but
it
would
also
be
true
if
a
rule
were
laid
down
that
they
had
to
tell
him
the
basis
and
they
refused
to
tell
him
the
basis.
it
had
still
the
--
the
--
excuse
me
--
that's
the
end
of
my
argument.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
of
course
we
make
the
very
sharp
distinction
between
the
fourth
and
first
amendment
and
since
we
do
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
say
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
could
call
him
off
the
street.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
think
that
they
could
bring
him
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
want
to
make
it
clear
though
that
if
they
ask
him,
"are
you
a
communist?"
this
court
has
suggested
that
--
that
that
question
may
not
be
able
to
be
asked
unless
they
have
some
basis.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
thank
you,
your
honors.
