whittaker
mr.

if
i
may
ask

mean
when
you
say,
to
use
the
phrase,
“probable
cause”
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
in
this
sense?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
the
--
that's
the
government's
obligation
to
show?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
probable
cause
is
shown
by
legally
competent
evidence?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
then
you're
relying
in

e.
whittaker
but
what
about
the
griffin
case
and
the
carroll

which
say
that
you
don't
have
to
show
even
probable
cause
to
sustain
a
search
by
legally
competent
evidence,
but
that
it
may
be
done
even
by
hearsay.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
the
application
of
the
jenkins

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
fanelli?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
to
understand,
when
you
say
indictment
is
invalid,
i
take
it
is
that
you
mean
it
is
void?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
reason
is
because

justice
charles
e.
whittaker

justice
charles

would
you
tell
me,
is
there
a
different
rule
in
your
judgment
to
be
applied
to
a
subpoena
of
this
character
from
a
subpoena
of
a
--
a
witness
in
a
civil
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
now
are
you
saying
that
one
of
my
clients
who
subpoenaed
can
testify
or
to
produce
papers
and
it
seem
to
me,
i
would
be
justified
in
going
within
and
they're
saying,
"just
keep
your
mouth
shut.
you
don't
have
to
testify
until
the
personation
in
the
subpoena
first
make
some
kind
of
a
preliminary
showing
that
you
may
have
information
of
value
and
only
then
will
you
have
to
talk.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
what's
the
difference
between
that
subpoena
and
this
subpoena?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
if
i
may
ask
you,
doesn't
your
argument
though
phrased
in
terms
of
probable
cause
really
mean
good
faith?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice
charles
