mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
mr.
chief
justice
sir,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
mr.
russell.
his
case
is
here
on
the
summary
calendar
for
review
of
his
conviction
by
the
district
court
here
in
washington,
which
had
been
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
our
first
contention
which
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
powers
of
congress
is
that
the
indictment
was
invalid
for
failure
to
specify
the
subject
of
inquiry.
and
the
question,
in
view
of
something
that
mr.
silard
said
in
the
shelton
case
which
preceded
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
indictment
failed
precisely
to
--
to
specify
a
subject
of
inquiry,
but
rather
whether
it
has
to
say
something
about
the
subject
of
inquiry
because
in
this
case,
as
is
true
in
the
other
five
contempt
cases
now
before
the
court,
there
was
nothing
stated
as
to
the
subject
of
inquiry.
here,
the
questions
upon
which
your
petitioner
was
indicted
are
set
forth
in
individual
counts
and
then
with
respect
to
all
of
them,
the
indictment
merely
says
that
the
questions
were
pertinent
to
the
question
then
on
under
inquiry.
nothing
further,
just
that.
in
the
course
of
this
argument,
i
shall
use
the
term
subject
of
inquiry
rather
than
question
of
inquiry.
in
the
cruikshank
case
decided
as
well
to
go
as
the
92
volume
of
your
official
reports,
this
court
established
a
rule
which
had
been
prefigured
and
foreshadowed
by
decisions
in
the
lower
federal
courts
that
when
a
statute
defines
an
offense
in
generics
terms,
as
the
contempt
statute
does,
that
an
indictment
setting
forth
an
offence
pursuant
to
that
statute
must
dissent
its
--
such
an
act
were,
must
dissent
to
particulars.
in
the
85
years
since
this
court's
decision
in
cruikshank,
that
case
has
been
applied
repeatedly
and
continuously
and
up
until
just
last
year
in
the
lower
federal
courts
to
invalidate
indictments
attempting
to
allege
various
types
of
crime
for
failure
to
state
factual
particulars
instead
of
statutory
generic
terms.
and
a
basic
reason
even
in
this
court
and
in
the
law
of
federal
courts
for
such
invalidation
is
that
where
an
indictment
uses
generic
terms
instead
of
particulars,
the
defendant
is
deprived
of
his
right
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
be
apprised
with
reasonable
certainty
of
the
accusation
against
him
so
that
he
may
prepare
his
defense.
now,
we
do
not
reduce
from
the
cruikshank
case
and
the
long
line
of
cases
that
have
followed
it
and
applied
it.
we
do
not
reduce
and
we
do
not
urge
that
any
indictment
is
invalid
if
for
any
generic
statutory
term,
all
of
the
particulars
are
not
given.
we
readily
admit
that
so
broad
a
rule,
applied
in
some
cases
wouldn't
make
much
sense
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
it's
at
about
page
6
of
the
record
your
honor,
page
2,
record
2.
for
example
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
no,
we
did
not
but
i
will
reach
that
point
in
just
about
five
minute,
sir.
your
honor,
i
may
just
now
in
its
real
question
that
the
government
made
an
opening
statement
that
was
quite
revealing
at
the
trial.
for
example,
in
terms
of
a
case
where
the
cruikshank
rule
might
not
make
any
sense
is
a
--
that
at
the
periphery
of
a
--
the
statutory
offence
of
perjury
is
the
requirement,
that
a
witness
had
been
sworn,
that
an
indictment
which
fails
to
state
the
name
of
the
person
who
administered
the
oath
is
not
fair
for
that
reason.
the
name
of
that
person
is
a
simple,
easily
identified
fact.
it
is
open
to
the
defendant's
easy
investigation
or
to
being
obtained
from
the
prosecution
upon
a
bills
of
particulars
and
the
name
of
the
person
who
administered
the
oath
is
the
same
whether
the
indictment
states
it,
whether
the
defendant
obtains
it
on
his
own
investigation
or
whether
the
prosecution
supplies
it
by
interrogatory.
that
essentially
is
the
debrow
case
upon
which
the
government
relies
as
being
applicable
here
but
that
case
which
makes,
we
don't
doubt,
considerable
sets
in
the
context
in
which
it
would
have
--
was
applied,
makes
no
sense
in
the
context
of
this
case.
of
course,
this
court
does
not
set
to
apply
by
rule,
even
the
well
established
cruikshank
line
of
cases
or
a
somewhat
new
and
novel
rule
that
the
government
suggests
here
that
the
indictments
in
statutory
terms
are
generally
good.
we
take
it
that
that
this
case
like
other
cases
must
be
decided
in
its
own
context
and
i
turn
to
that
context.
but
i
note
in
passing
that
as
to
the
point
that
i
am
now
discussing
namely,
whether
this
statute
is
invalid,
i'm
sorry
this
indictment
is
invalid
for
failure
to
specify
the
subject
of
inquiry,
the
context
of
this
case
is
not
so
far
as
i
am
aware
significantly
different
for
any
of
the
other
five
cases
now
before
this
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes
sir?
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes
sir,
vitiated,
void,
invalidated,
yes
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes,
precisely
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes
sir,
precisely
sir.
the
first
important
aspect
of
the
subject
--
of
the
context
to
this
case
is
--
that
in
this
type
of
contempt
case
and
by
type,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
mean
contempt
of
congress'
cases,
the
subject
of
inquiry
is
generally
a
very
difficult
thing
to
ascertain.
it
is
true
that
those
who
believe
that
they
have
ascertained
it,
stated
with
confidence
but
different
charges
with
equal
confidence
state
different
subjects
of
inquiry
in
the
same
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i
think
they
might,
yes
your
honor.
one
need
only
compare
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
watkins
and
sacher
cases
with
the
opinions
of
the
court
below
in
those
same
cases
or
as
another
example,
one
need
only
compare
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinions
of
this
court
in
deutch,
but
in
any
event
in
this
case,
the
subject
of
inquiry
was
a
very
difficult
thing
to
ascertain.
as
to
the
government's
position
on
it,
they
have
always
been
confident
that
the
subject
of
inquiry
has
been
very
clear,
but
it's
been
a
different
subject
of
inquiry
at
every
level
of
this
case.
at
trial,
the
government's
basic
position
was
that
the
subject
of
inquiry
was
no
less
than
house
resolution
number
5,
the
resolution
which
empowers
a
house
committee
on
un-american
activities.
at
the
same
time
at
trial
in
a
feeble
to
prove
something
which
the
government
calls
special
pertinence,
some
dozen-and-a-half
possible
subjects
of
inquiry
were
introduced
but
they
were
not
hooked
up
in
any
way
to
this
petitioner
or
the
questions
asked
of
him.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
again
was
asserting
of
what
the
subject
of
inquiry
was.
i
must
take
that
in
their
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
stated
somewhat
ambiguously,
but
apparently
the
subject
of
inquiry
was
infiltration
of
communism
among
the
leadership
of
the
united
electrical
radio
and
machine
workers
of
america
or
just
possibly
communist
policy
of
colonization
in
essential
industry.
in
this
court,
the
government
has
remained
confident
of
what
was
the
subject
of
inquiry
at
the
time
the
petitioner
testified.
in
its
brief
and
opposition
that
subject
of
inquiry
according
to
the
government
very
clear,
communist
activity
at
anitoch
college
and
now
on
its
brief
on
the
merits,
the
government
at
least
is
consistent
on
the
confidence
with
which
it
defines
the
subject
of
inquiry,
now
on
its
brief
on
the
merits,
the
subject
of
inquiry
has
become
communist
activity
and
the
dayton
yellow
springs
area.
on
the
congressional
side,
there
has
been
somewhat
more
confusion.
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
made
an
announcement
that
the
outset
of
the
hearings
at
which
petitioner
appeared.
the
announcement
covers
some
six
pages
of
the
record.
it
recites
a
number
of
subjects
that
are
not
claimed
to
have
any
connection
with
the
petitioner
or
the
questions
which
he
was
asked
and
the
(inaudible)
began
in
a
time
that
must
have
been
some
five
seconds,
it
mentions,
as
the
chairman
mentions
in
his
announcement,
that
there
was
some
sort
of
controversy
in
the
dayton
yellow
springs
area.
he
doesn't
state
what
the
controversy
was
and
he
explicitly
states
that
committee
is
going
to
stay
out
of
it.
then
he
goes
on
the
say
that
complaints
and
just
that
complaints,
not
from
whom
or
what
about
but
just
complaints
from
the
dayton
yellow
springs
area
had
left
to
the
series
of
hearings
at
which
your
petitioner
testified.
but
at
the
trial,
when
we
sought
to
ascertain
what
these
complaints
from
the
dayton
yellow
springs
area
were
about,
counsel
for
the
government
objected
made
the
explicit
statement
that
our
questions
seeking
to
ascertain
what
was
the
nature
of
these
complaints
was
“not
relevant
to
any
issue
in
this
case”
stated
that
we
were
just
on
a
remote
fishing
expedition.
the
court
agreed
with
them
and
we
were
unable
to
ascertain
what
the
complaints
were
about.
and
committee
counsel
who
testified
at
the
trial,
at
the
behalf
of
the
government
testified
that
the
hearings
at
which
petitioner
testified
or
appeared
that
the
subject
of
inquiry
that
there
wasn't
any
particular
subject
of
inquiry
or
in
other
words
that
the
committee
was
pursuing
no
subject
less
than
house
resolution
number
5.
so
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
by
the
opening
statement,
during
the
course
of
the
trial
by
our
attempts
to
ascertain
what
these
complaints
from
the
yellow
springs,
dayton
yellow
springs
area
were
about
and
at
the
end
of
the
trial
when
committee
counsel,
who
was
the
government's
last
witness
to
testify,
the
government
consistently
took
the
position
at
trial
that
the
subject
of
inquiry
was
no
different
from,
no
more
than,
no
less
than
but
was
house
resolution
number
5,
the
so
called
shadow
of
the
house
on
american
activities.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
the
district
court
mr.
justice
stewart
--
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
grand
jury
all
found
that
the
questions
were
pertinent
to
the
subject
of
inquiry,
but
they
all
managed
to
do
so
without
stating
what
it
was.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
just
before
the
recess,
i
was
covering
the
aspect
of
the
context
here
which
is
namely
that
the
subject
of
inquiry
in
this
case
was
a
very
difficult
thing
to
ascertain.
and
in
that
connection,
i
have
one
more
item
to
mention
on
the
congressional
side
namely
that
the
annual
report
of
the
committee
which
was
again
introduced
by
the
government
at
the
trial
in
this
case
states
that
the
subject
under
inquiry
when
petitioner
was
testifying
was,
“communist
infiltration
in
basic
industries
throughout
the
united
states.”
at
the
same
time,
however,
the
annual
report
goes
on
to
say
that
during
the
course
of
these
hearings
at
which
petitioner
testified,
several
witnesses
from
institutions
of
higher
learning
were
called
apparently
as
site
excursion.
as
i
have
already
noted
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
the
grand
jury,
the
trial
judge,
the
court
of
appeals
all
found
that
the
questions
here
were
pertinent
to
the
subject
of
inquiry
but
all
managed
to
do
so
without
statement
of
what
it
was.
in
short
your
honors,
the
subject
of
inquiry
here
is
so
difficult
to
ascertain
that
grand
jury,
trial
judge
and
court
of
appeals
stood
silent
on
the
subject
and
now,
the
government
clearly
discerns
a
subject
of
inquiry
namely
communist
activity
in
the
dayton
yellow
springs
area
which
it
specifically
disavowed
at
trial
as
not
related
to
any
issue
in
this
case
and
therefore
part
of
a
fishing
expedition
by
the
defense.
the
second
important
aspect
of
the
context
here
with
--
with
relation
to
this
point
is
that
this
elusive
thing,
this
thing
that
is
so
difficult
to
ascertain,
this
subject
of
inquiry
is
essential
as
the
court
noted
in
deutch
to
the
--
to
determination
and
therefore
also
to
defense
on
at
least
four
central
issues
in
a
contempt
of
congress
case.
three
constitutional
issues
namely,
whether
the
subject
transgresses
first
amendment
limitations,
a
second
constitutional
issue
as
to
whether
the
subject
of
inquiry
found
was
delegated
by
the
congress
to
this
committee
and
then
again
to
the
subcommittee,
a
third
constitutional
issue
namely
the
due
process,
one
as
to
whether
the
witness
was
appraised
of
the
pertinence
of
the
questions
and
the
non-constitutional
issue,
part
of
the
statutory
offense
whether
the
questions
were
pertinent
to
the
subject
of
inquiry.
again,
to
get
the
real
color
and
flavor
of
this,
contrast
a
perjury
case,
there
the
ascertainment
of
the
inquiry
is
not
at
all
related
to
two
basic
issues
in
a
perjury
case,
the
two
central
issues
of
truth
or
falsity
and
intentional
falsity
or
honest
error.
and
yet,
there
is
still
a
fair
and
important
aspect
of
the
context
here
on
this
question
and
that
is
that
the
failure
of
the
grand
jury
to
specify
in
this
indictment,
the
subject
of
inquiry.
prejudice
is
not
only
the
defendant's
defense
in
violation
of
his
rights
pursuant
to
the
sixth
amendment,
but
also
the
performance
by
the
trial
court,
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
this
court
of
their
article
3
functions
of
decision
--
judicial
decision
and
review.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
we
don't
argue
that
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
that's
right.
we're
not
arguing
here
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
when
--
we're
making
no
point
of
it,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
--
that
he
didn't.
we're
willing
to
assume
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
he
did
not.
i
don't
want
a
prejudice
other
cases
where
someone
maybe
arguing
differently
on
--
on
the
same
set
of
facts
or
similar
set
of
facts.
so
far
as
the
petitioner
is
concerned,
it
is
the
failure
of
the
grand
jury
to
specify
the
subject
of
inquiry
in
this
indictment
that
makes
it
possible
for
the
prosecution
to
convict
petitioner
on
house
resolution
number
5
as
the
subject
of
inquiry
to
get
the
conviction
affirmed
on
another
subject
of
inquiry
and
to
argue
here
for
affirmance
on
a
third
subject
of
inquiry
that
was
disavowed
as
--
at
trial
as
unrelated
to
any
of
the
issues
in
part
of
a
fishing
expedition.
the
prosecution
now
says
that
we
should
have
asked
for
a
bill
of
particulars,
but
in
answer
to
that
suggestion,
we
say
first,
that
it
is
the
only
grand
jury's
specification
of
the
subject
under
inquiry
that
effectively
confines
the
prosecution
to
one
due
process
channel
of
prosecution
for
one
charged
offense.
second,
if
we
had
asked
for
a
bill
of
particulars
instead
of
relying
on
the
government's
position
throughout
the
trial
and
in
its
opening
statement,
i
suppose
that
the
government
would
now
be
arguing
as
it
doesn't
show
them
that
it's
not
bound
by
opening
statements
and
by
bill
of
particulars.
but
furthermore
fundamentally
we
say,
the
persecution
was
clear
enough
on
what
it
thought
the
subject
of
inquiry
was
at
trial.
our
trouble
is
not
that
the
prosecution
failed
to
reveal
its
hand
on
the
subject
of
inquiry
that
essential
part
of
one
element
of
this
offense
rather
what
we
sought
it
from
is
that
in
deprivation
of
petitioner's
rights
both
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
under
the
due
process
clause
and
here,
i
have
in
my
mind
such
cases
as
giordenello,
stirone,
cadiacos,
namely
that
you
can't
be
convicted
of
one
offence
and
have
it
affirmed
on
another,
that
in
deprivation
of
his
rights,
the
government
has
revealed
a
different
hand
as
to
the
subject
of
inquiry
at
every
adjudicatory
level
of
this
case,
as
to
the
prejudice
to
this
court,
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
the
trial
court
resulting
from
the
failure
of
the
indictment
to
specify
the
subject
of
inquiry.
this
court
in
watkins
had
verdict
to
the
troubles
on
review
arising
from
the
vagueness
of
house
resolution
number
5,
but
--
yes
sir?
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
oh,
we
also
make
that
argument.
but
i'm
trying
to
point
out
the
reasons,
your
honor,
why
this
court
should
hold
that
an
indictment
in
this
type
of
case
should
give
the
nature
of
the
subject
of
the
inquiry.
we
also
make
an
another
argument
independently
that
the
proof
of
subject
under
inquiry,
that
is
the
proof
of
a
subject
--
that
is
a
permissible
subject
of
inquiry
failed
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
your
honor,
in
answer
to
that
question,
i
would
like
to
refer
you
to
the
cases
--
no,
it
is
not
the
general
law
in
our
view,
if
i
may
differ
with
your
honor.
but
i
would
like
to
refer
you
to
the
cases
we
have
collected,
beginning
at
page
41
of
our
brief
and
particularly,
the
cases
cited
in
footnote
27
of
page
43.
every
one
of
those
cases
will
be
contrary
to
the
suggested
statement
you've
just
made,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
footnote

on

mr.
justice
black.
but
here,
the
situation
is
much
worse
than
the
difficulties
of
court
faced
in
watkins
because
the
indictment
does
not
specify
the
subject
of
inquiry,
this
court
can
be
almost
certain
but
not
absolutely
certain
that
the
grand
jury
found
house
resolution
number
5
as
the
subject
of
inquiry
from
which
it
found
probable
cause
for
pertinence
because
that
was
the
government's
position
at
that
time
in
the
pre-watkins
phase,
that
is
in
the
days
before
this
court's
decision
in
watkins.
that
was
the
government's
uniform
and
basic
position
in
this
case
and
in
every
other
contempt
to
congress
case.
this
court
can
be
almost
certain,
but
not
absolutely
certain
that
the
trial
judge
also
convicted
on
the
basis
of
house
resolution
number
5,
which
under
the
watkins
case
is
impermissible
subject
of
inquiry,
being
too
vague
and
third,
this
court
can
be
almost
certain
but
not
absolutely
certain
that
the
court
of
appeals
impermissibly
in
view
of
cardiaco
and
stirone
and
etcetera
affirmed
that
conviction
on
the
basis
of
still
a
--
another
subject
of
inquiry
although
we
don't
know
what
it
was
because
by
that
time,
this
court
had
decided
the
watkins
case.
a
fourth
and
important
aspect
of
this
context
is
that
to
approve
of
this
indictment
is
to
sanction
a
most
extraordinary
violation
of
the
well-settled
rule
against
amendments
of
indictments
by
trial
court
or
by
prosecutor.
here,
the
grand
jury
left
the
blank
at
the
very
center
of
this
case
that
settle
upon
which
at
least
those
four
important
questions
depend
which
the
government,
the
trial
judge
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
fill
in
at
will
and
did.
and
fifth
and
lastly
and
maybe
most
importantly
is
that
once
the
grand
jury
has
done
its
duty
and
ascertained
a
subject
of
inquiry
on
the
basis
of
which
it
confined
the
probable
cause
to
charge
an
offence
pursuant
to
the
contempt
statute
which
of
course
is
the
grand
jury's
function
and
we
don't
understand
that
the
government
denies
that.
the
subject
of
inquiry
is
stated
in
the
indictment
simply
without
difficulty
and
in
just
a
few
words
as
mr.
terris
said
to
in
the
course
of
the
shelton
case
argument,
its
communist
activity
and
infiltration
of
news
media
or
here,
communist
activity
in
the
dayton
yellow
springs
area.
it
is
no
difficulty
at
all
for
the
grand
jury
or
the
government
to
state
it
once
the
grand
jury
has
performed
its
function
and
found
it.
indeed,
that
is
just
the
case
of
lorch.
lorch
testified
at
the
same
hearings
of
which
petitioner
testified.
he
was
first
indicted
by
precisely
the
same
sort
of
amendment
as
here,
but
the
trial
court
out
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio
dismissed
that
indictment
for
failure
to
specify
the
subject
of
inquiry.
the
government
went
back
to
the
grand
jury
and
got
an
indictment
which
states
that
the
subject
of
inquiry
at
the
time
was
communist
activities
in
the
dayton
yellow
springs
area.
and
if
the
subject
of
inquiry
stated
in
just
a
few
words,
the
defendant
can
prepare
his
arguments
in
defense
and
the
courts
can
intelligently
decide
on
such
issues
has
is
the
subject
of
inquiry
sufficiently
definite,
is
it
within
the
committee's
delegated
powers,
is
it
one
which
outweighs
the
concomitant
first
amendment
transgressions,
were
the
questions
pertinent
to
it?
was
the
witness
had
far
as
of
that
pertinence?
in
fine,
the
government
insists
on
indictments
which
do
not
specify
the
subject
of
inquiry
although
there
is
every
reason
in
affording
the
defense
an
opportunity
for
defense
and
in
affor
--
and
affording
the
courts
an
opportunity
for
intelligent
review
to
insist
on
that
specification
and
no
reason
at
all
for
not
specifying
it
except
that
prosecution
can
be
obtained
and
affirmed
more
readily
because
of
the
very
prejudice
to
the
--
to
defense
and
to
the
courts
in
their
article
iii
duty
which
results
from
non-specification.
in
the
sinclair
case,
the
court
stated
that
the
government
must
plead
pertinence
in
a
contempt
of
congress
case
and
surely
in
view
of
the
considerations
we
have
advanced
this
court
must
have
meant
more
than
the
empty
ritual
of
having
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who's
accredited
to
the
grand
jury
read
the
statute
and
see
that
it's
quoted
accurately
in
the
indictment.
the
government
relies
heavily
on
the
markham
case.
this
was
a
perjury
case.
the
government
says
that
it
holds
--
that
in
a
perjury
case,
you
don't
have
to
state
the
inquiry.
and
the
government
says
further
the
perjury
case
is
just
like
contempt
of
congress
cases.
we
say
first
that
in
the
markham
case,
the
opinion
explicitly
states
and
the
record
shows
that
the
inquiry
in
the
markham
case
was,
as
this
court
stated,
manifest
on
the
face
of
the
indictment.
moreover,
as
we've
already
noted,
in
a
contempt
of
congress
case,
unlike
a
perjury
case,
knowledge
of
the
subject
of
inquiry
is
the
touchstone
to
defense
and
judicial
solution
on
practically
all
of
the
important
issues
in
the
case.
we
might
note
further
that
per
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i
--
i
did
refer
to
that
in
the
course
of
my
argument
but
when
i
get
up
again,
i'd
be
glad
--
glad
to
refer
to
it
again,
mr.
justice
unless
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
i
don't
see
how
it
can
cure
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
in
our
case
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
i
don't
see
how
a
bill
of
particulars
would
have
been
any
different
from
the
opening
statement,
your
honor
and
also,
i
don't
think
it
would
cure
it
in
any
case
because
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
--
we're
entitled,
your
honor,
even
if
they
haven't
made
an
opening
statement,
we're
entitled
to
be
tried
on
what
the
grand
jury
found
as
this
offense,
not
on
what
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
thinks
it
is
and
therefore,
his
statement
to
us
doesn't
supply
that
the
effect
on
the
indictment
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
you
have
stated
our
contention
precisely.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
mr.
chief
justice
sir
first,
i
want
to
thank
you
for
the
graciousness
of
permitting
me
the
extra
time,
i
think
that's
the
first
time
that's
ever
happened
to
me
in
my
life.
i'd
like
to
state
while
i
have
the
time
and
while
it
hasn't
run
out
that
we
argue
not
only
the
invalidity
of
this
indictment
for
the
failure
to
specify
the
subject
under
inquiry,
not
only
the
subject
that
mr.
justice
whittaker
referred
to,
that
is
failure
to
prove
a
permissible
subject
of
inquiry,
not
only
the
subject
that
my
brother
counsel
touched
on
in
the
latter
part
of
his
argument
that
the
indictment
was
invalid
for
an
additional
reason,
but
we
also
argue
that
the
defendant
was
called
for
the
purpose
of
punishing
him
for
contempt
rather
than
on
legislative
aid,
on
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
also,
under
the
yates
case
that
he
committed
one
indict
--
one
offense
which
was
a
committed
one
--
one
offense
for
--
unlike
yates,
not
the
offense
for
which
he
was
indicted
and
that
therefore,
this
conviction
must
be
reversed
for
that
reason
and
four
reversible
in
prejudicial
errors
that
occurred
at
trial
in
a
particular
aspect
of
this
case.
now,
i'd
like
to
take
a
--
and
we
think
they're
all
good,
but
i
just
don't
have
the
time
to
argue
them
all.
i
would
like
to
spend
just
one
moment
on
the
specification
of
subject
of
inquiry
in
the
indictment
and
then
touch
for
a
few
moments
on
the
grand
jury
point.
that
is
the
business
of
government
employees
on
it.
i'm
afraid
that
my
brother
counsel
has
pretty
well-demonstrated
what
has
always
been
my
feeling
about
this
subject
of
inquiry
that
once
you
think
you
have
it,
you're
very
confident
about
it.
i
will
repeat
that
the
subject
of
inquiry
now
claimed
was
specifically
disavowed
at
trial
and
i
might
point
out
in
addition
that
as
to
the
univis
lens
--
univis
lens
strike,
the
united
electrical
and
radio
workers
which
occupied
a
lot
of
time
in
this
hearing
have
no
relation
at
all
to
the
questions
ask
to
the
petitioner,
and
that
the
only
statement
as
to
petitioner
was,
that
he
was
not
involved
in
that
strike.
i
want
to
say
in
the
end
that
as
to
markham,
as
i've
stated,
the
court
found
the
inquiry
manifest
on
the
face
of
the
indictment
and
record
supports
the
court
on
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes
sir,
that's
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
--
a
very
important
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
because
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
no.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
they
say
no,
we
say
yes,
but
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes,
they
do
in
the
shelton
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes,
so
they
argue,
but
i
say
this
mr.
justice,
that
it
isn't
just
a
question
of
nailing
down
the
prosecution.
it's
the
question
of
nailing
down
the
prosecution
to
the
crime
which
the
grand
jury
has
charged
and
this
is
not
taken
care
of
by
bill
of
particulars.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
in
terms
of
not
--
not
having
the
government
jump
around
them,
but
it
doesn't
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
that
--
that
--
that
may
be
true
also,
but
it
doesn't
take
care
of
a
good
part
of
our
argument
mr.
justice
because
it
doesn't
nail
down
the
court
of
appeals
to
what
the
grand
jury
said,
and
if
i
may
say
so
with
all
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
it
apparently
did
in
shelton.
it
departed
--
well,
i
don't
know
what
it
did,
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
mean
because
i
didn't
state
it.
that's
why
--
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
prejudice
to
courts,
that
is
also
not
taken
care
of
by
bill
of
particulars
on
--
i
see
a
red
light
here
on.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i
did
--
i
did
want
to
make
one
other
comment
if
i
may,
about
as
this
--
this
point
namely
that
the
government
has
not
suggested
one
single
reason
from
their
point
of
view
as
to
why
this
indictment
should
not
specify
the
subject
of
inquiry.
and
it
was
until
the
most
recent
era
of
cong
--
congressional
contempt
cases,
it
was
traditional
to
state
and
the
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief,
to
state
the
subject
of
inquiry
in
contempt
of
congress
cases
and
they
state
no
reason
now
for
departing
from
that
traditional
approach
in
a
more
dragnet
procedure
of
not
stating
it
and
if
there
were
not
the
constitutional
issues
involved,
this
case
boils
down,
if
there
were
no
constitutional
issues
related
to
this
point,
to
this
court's
supervisory
powers
over
the
federal
courts
and
whether
it's
going
to
permit
a
conviction
obtained
by
procedures
so
unfair
stemming
from
this
failure
of
specification
to
spare.
now,
to
come
to
the
grand
jury
point
with
your
honor's
permission
for
a
moment,
i
--
if
i
understand
the
government's
argument
correctly,
the
government
admits
that
a
grand
juror
like
a
petit
jury
must
be
impartial.
as
the
chief
justice
drew
from
the
government,
they
don't
seem
to
provide
any
avenue
for
testing
this,
but
at
least
they
concede
that
much
and
then
in
any
event,
this
court
has
said
again
and
again
that
one
of
a
defendant's
rights
is
to
an
impartial,
or
rather
the
word
that
has
been
used
is
unbiased
or
non-biased
grand
jury.
i
want
to
say
to
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
it
is
not
our
contention
that
government
employees
are
prohibited
from
sitting
in
prosecutions
by
the
united
states
and
i
want
to
say
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
we
are
not
arguing
anything
but
a
grand
jury
which
sat
in
washington
d.c.,
in
or
about
1954,
as
this
grand
jury
did
with
a
majority
of
government
employees
in
a
case
related
to
the
national
security
of
the
united
states
or
more
specifically
to
communism
and
we
say
as
to
that
type
of
case
and
not
grand
jury
that
it
was
not
qualified
to
pass
upon
probable
cause
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
no
sir,
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
--
apparently,
i
failed
to
make
myself
clear.
i
will
state
it
again.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
for
a
grand
jury
in
1954,
to
have
honored
in
a
case
involving
the
national
security,
or
communism
if
you
will,
the
two
are
frequently
acquitted
although
i
think
there
are
differences,
a
majority
of
government
employees
who
have
just
been
through
seven
years
of
the
intimidation
and
oppression
of
loyalty-security
programs,
that
a
grand
jury
sitting
at
that
point
could
not
validly
have
honored
a
majority
of
government
employees.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
let
me
--
i
was
just
going
to
go
on
mr.
justice
brennan
to
the
proposition
that
in
frazier,
mr.
justice
jackson
had
the
insight
to
foresee
what
was
beginning
to
happen,
that
in
dennis,
in
1952
and
dennis
rejected
a
contention
there
be
--
specifically
noting
that
the
--
the
loyalty
order
had
been
in
effect
for
just
two
months,
but
even
there,
two
justices
of
this
court
dissenting,
took
judicial
notice
of
what
i
am
complaining
about
in
1954.
now,
i'm
told
that
in
dissenting
opinions,
you
must
have
paid
too
much
attention
to
those,
but
i
don't
believe
that.
the
in
most
dissenting
opinions,
those
justices
took
judicial
notice
of
what
we
have
proven
in
this
case,
and
what
became
obvious
by
1954
when
we
reached
the
stake
in
this
nation.
i
wish
i
could
evoke
it
but
one
need
only
read
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
dennis
or
mr.
justice
black's
also,
when
we
reached
the
period,
when
one
could
say
what
the
profit
might
give
that
hunts
every
men
his
brother
with
a
neck
and
we're
just
slowly
emerging
from
that,
but
i'm
not
arguing
about
a
grand
jury
sitting
today
or
in
another
type
of
case,
no
one
that
sat
in
1948.
we
do
argue
with
subsidiary
contention
namely
that
we
were
at
least
entitled
to
a
hearing,
and
that
to
grant
us
a
hearing
today
under
bias
is
not
the
same
as
a
hearing
then
because
as
we
put
it,
when
the
battle
is
over,
all
men
would
pray,
and
you
can
extract
this
fear
now,
and
that
therefore
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed
on
that
ground.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i
think
we
did.
now
he
refers
to
the
opinion
of
two
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
there
--
if
you
would
start
with
record
number
9.
this
was
an
affidavit
with
counsel
and
the
case
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
it
incorporates
two
affidavits
by
two
social
psychologists
who
--
who
made
a
survey.
well,
it
wasn't
just
an
expression
of
opinion
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
as
to
those
two
affidavits.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes,
thank
you
very
much.
