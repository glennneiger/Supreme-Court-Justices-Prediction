mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
was
indicted
on
19
counts
for
declining
to
answer
certain
questions
of
the
senate
internal
subcommittee
put
to
him
on
january
6,
1956.
he
was
tried
without
a
jury.
he
was
convicted
on
all
counts.
he
was
sentenced
to
a
term
of
6
months
suspended
prison
sentence
and
a
fine
of
$500.00.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
affirmed
the
conviction
and
your
honors
granted
certiorari.
at
the
time
of
his
appearance
before
the
subcommittee
on
internal
security,
the
petitioner
appropriately
raised
questions
concerning
the
authority
of
the
subcommittee
and
concerning
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
which
were
asked
him,
objections
which
were
renewed
throughout
the
course
of
his
interrogation.
he
answered
fully
all
questions
concerning
his
own
acknowledged
membership
in
the
communist
party
between
the
years
1935
and
1948
and
made
it
entirely
clear
to
the
committee
that
all
of
his
activities
have
been
lawful,
political
activities
when
engaged
in.
he
declined,
however,
to
answer
any
questions
which
sought
the
names
of
persons
who
have
been
associated
with
him
in
the
communist
party
or
from
which
their
identity
might
readily
be
ascertained.
at
his
trial,
the
petitioner
took
the
stand
in
his
own
defense;
he
testified
at
some
length
concerning
the
reasons
which
had
led
him
to
the
depths
of
the
depression
in
1935
to
become
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
fact
that
his
studies
in
history
--
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
he
had
just
graduated
from
college,
justice
frankfurter,
harvard
incidentally
mr.
justice.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
in
1935
--
well,
i
believe
he
graduated
in
'34
in
the
event
he
was
comparatively
recently
out
of
college.
he
explained
that
his
studies
of
history
had
convinced
him
that
third
parties
had
exercised
an
energizing
influence
in
american
political
life.
he
described
at
some
length
or
offered
to
prove
his
activities
within
the
party
which
were
the
usual
rather
humdrum
activities
attending
public
meetings,
distributing
leaflets,
selling
copies
of
the
daily
worker
and
the
rest
of
it.
he
made
it
clear
that
his
membership
in
the
party
had
not
been
clandestine,
that
it
was
known
to
his
friends
and
associates,
that
he
engaged
in
no
conspiratorial
activities
and
that
the
same
was
true
so
far
he
was
aware
of
those
who
were
associated
with
him
in
the
party.
indeed
there
is,
if
the
court
please,
a
striking
parallel
between
the
reasons
for
his
entering
the
party
and
his
activities
within
it
and
those
of
(inaudible)
which
your
honors
held
were
insufficient
to
warn
his
exclusion
from
the
bar.
he
also
testified
at
length
concerning
his
growing
disinterest
in
the
party;
his
eventual
dissatisfaction
with
it
and
his
reasons
for
leaving
the
party
in
1948,
some
8
years
prior
to
the
time
of
his
interrogation
by
the
subcommittee.
he
was
asked
at
trial
to
state
his
reasons
for
declining
to
answer
the
questions
which
had
been
put
to
him
and
he
responded
as
follows;
i
read
from
page
9
of
our
brief
and
i
omit
some
portions
of
his
answer.
he
said,
?i
felt
that
by
i
being
compelled
to
answer
the
questions
which
i
decline
to
answer
that
i
would
be
cast
in
the
role
of
an
informer.
unlike
most
americans,
i
have
been
brought
up
to
despise
and
deplore
the
tattletale,
the
squealer
and
the
informer.
i
felt
i
would
be
violating
the
principles
and
tenets
on
which
i
have
been
brought
up,
if
i
were
asked
to
assume
that
role.
i
felt
that
i
knew
that
i
have
engaged
only
during
the
period
of
communist
party
membership
only
in
lawful
activity.
i
knew
that
my
associates
had
engaged
only
during
the
period
on
communist
party
membership
only
in
lawful
activity.
i
felt
that
as
a
result
of
what
i
knew
to
be
the
case,
that
if
i
were
to
name
names
to
be
an
informer,
that
the
result
would
be
terrible
trouble
on
the
shoulders
and
the
heads
of
people
to
were
as
innocent
as
i
of
any
wrongdoing.
i
was
confirmed
in
this
belief
by
the
fact
that
i
knew
my
own
knowledge
of
people
who
had
lost
jobs,
whose
careers
have
been
wrecked;
whose
families
have
been
upset,
whose
children
have
been
dislocated
purely
because
i
have
been
exposed
to
the
committee
by
somebody
for
what
in
its
own
time
had
been
perfectly
legal
activity.
and
i
felt
that
it
would
be
a
mean
and
ignoble
thing
if
i
would
be
defective;
an
agent
to
bring
destruction
on
people.
i
knew
that
of
course
it
would
be
possible
to
save
my
own
skin
by
giving
the
committee
what
it
was
pressing
me
for;
namely
the
names
of
other
people,
but
i
felt
that
i
couldn't
in
all
conscience
do
this
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
of
the
great
heritages
and
privileges
that
i
had
as
a
citizen
in
a
democracy
was
that
of
personal
responsibility
for
my
acts.
i
felt
certain
as
a
matter
of
inner
conscience
here,
that
i
could
not
disclose
the
names
of
innocent
people
in
order
to
be
a
possible
benefit
to
myself.
i
realize
that
as
a
result,
i
would
undoubtedly
have
to
stay
on
trial
for
contempt.
the
likelihood
arose
of
going
to
jail
which
i
am
not
anxious
to
do,
but
i'm
here
less
anxious
sir
to
become
in
my
own
eyes
an
ignominious
person
and
i
feel
deeply
that
i
would
utterly
lose
my
self-respect
were
i
to
violate
the
terms
of
my
own
inner
integrity.?
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
a
suspended
sentence
of
6
months
in
prison
with
$500.00
your
honor.
now
if
the
court
please,
i
should
like
to
leave
the
numerous
legal
issues
which
are
raised
by
this
case
to
our
brief
in
order
to
discuss
it
solely
in
terms
of
the
balancing
test.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
at
his
trial
your
honor;
he
took
the
stand
and
testified
and
i
read
his
testimony
at
the
trial.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
he
couched
it
in
terms
of
the
authority
of
the
committee
and
in
terms
of
pertinency
of
the
questions
but
he
made
it
entirely
clear
that
would
and
he
did
answer
all
questions
except
those
which
sought
the
names
of
his
associates
or
information
from
which
they
could
be
identified
and
it
is
clear
enough
that
this
is
the
line
which
he
drew
at
the
time
of
his
appearance
--
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
he
did
your
honor
--
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
he
did
your
honor;
he
did
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
it's
one
in
the
blue
thing
your
honor.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
oh
yes
your
honor.
it's
summarized
--
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
yes.
your
honor
will
find
that
the
language
of
the
letter
which
he
presented
to
the
committee,
the
important
sections
of
it
are
set
out
at
page
21
of
the
record
which
you
have
there.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
that
blue
thing;
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
at
page
21.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
now
at
the
outset
of
applying
the
barenblatt
balancing
test,
we're
faced
with
a
serious
problem
which
has
plagued
this
case
from
its
very
inception
and
that
is
that
to
know
what
the
subject
under
inquiry
was.
we
have
appended
to
our
brief
as
appendix
a,
a
tabulation
which
shows
what
the
subjects
under
inquiry
in
this
case
and
its
companion
cases
was
asserted
to
be
at
various
stages
of
this
inquiry.
and
your
honors
will
readily
see
from
that
the
other
confusion
and
inconsistency
which
has
followed
this
issue
through
this
case.
this
served
to
emphasize
mr.
fanelli's
argument
that
unless
the
subject
under
inquiry
is
clearly
stated
in
the
indictment,
the
government
is
free
at
each
and
every
stage
of
the
case
to
change
its
position
with
respect
to
what
the
subject
under
inquiry
was.
for
the
purposes
of
my
argument
here,
i
will
assume
that
the
subject
under
inquiry
was
that
which
the
government
now
asserts
it
to
be,
noting
that
they
have
changed
their
positions
since
they
filed
their
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari
and
i
will
say
only
that
which
they
now
define
as
communist
activities
in
news
media.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
he
did
your
honor,
not
only
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing
but
repeatedly.
if
you'll
look
at
page
4,
page
7,
footnote
4
of
our
reply
brief,
you
will
find
summarized
there
the
numerous
record
citations
to
his
objections
on
the
ground
of
pertinency.
now,
as
i
say,
i
should
like
to
contrast
the
fragility
of
the
government's
interest
in
getting
answers
to
the
questions
which
you
asked
with
the
urgent
and
impelling
reasons
of
personal
privacy
which
lead
the
petitioner
to
decline
to
answer
these
questions.
at
the
question
under
inquiry
genuinely
been
the
communist
activities
in
news
media.
the
obviously
pertinent
question
to
have
asked
the
petitioner
would
have
been,
?do
you
have
any
present
knowledge
concerning
communist
activities
in
news
media??
since
this
was
not
a
question
which
sought
the
identity
of
others
and
since
the
petitioner
had
left
the
communist
party
some
eight
years
before,
the
answer
to
that
question
would
almost
certainly
have
been,
no.
or
the
committee
might
have
inquired,
do
you
have
any
information
about
communist
activities
in
news
media
since
the
passage
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
the
administration
and
enforcement
of
which
it
is
one
of
the
duties
of
the
committee
to
investigate.
again
the
petitioner
would
almost
certainly
have
answered
that
question,
?no?;
and
what
is
significant
about
this
case
is
that
nothing
which
even
remotely
approaches
those
two
possibly
pertinent
questions
were
put
to
him.
on
the
contrary,
the
committee
promptly
rummaged
around
in
ancient
history.
the
first
question
they
asked
him
which
he
declined
to
answer
related
in
1938,
18
years
prior
to
this
inquiry,
and
the
most
recent
question
which
he
declined
to
answer
related
to
1948,
8
years
before
the
inquiry.
now,
we
suggest
to
this
temporal
remoteness
and
which
we
would
acquaint
with
these
spatial
remoteness
on
which
your
honor
relied
in
deutch,
has
in
this
case
a
certain
special
significance.
it
might
properly
be
said
i
think
that
1950
marks
a
kind
of
watershed
in
the
public
and
official
attitude
toward
the
communist
party.
prior
to
that
time
it
was
by
and
large
regarded
as
another
lawful
political
party.
in
that
year,
this
internal
security
act
was
adopted,
in
that
year
your
honors
has
decided
american
communications
association
against
douds
and
it
was
in
that
year
that
korean
hostilities
erupted.
so
we
say
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
barenblatt
balancing
test,
questions
which
relate
to
years
prior
to
the
1950
must
weigh
much
less
in
the
scale
than
activities
engaged
in
subsequent
to
that
time.
obviously,
activities
engaged
in
during
this
period
will
have
far
less
impact
on
the
national
security
than
activities
engaged
in
since
not
only
because
they
are
more
remote
in
time,
but
also
because
they
differ
importantly
with
the
three.
and
we
think
it
is
important
that
all
of
the
questions
asked
related
to
lawful
political
activity.
now
i'm
of
course
aware
that
your
honors
have
held
that
law
--
inquiry
in
the
lawful
political
activities
on
the
part
of
these
committees
is
proper,
but
your
honors
have
not
held
to
my
knowledge
that
this
is
not
a
relevant
consideration
to
bear
in
mind
for
the
purposes
of
accomplishing
the
balancing
test
in
barenblatt,
that
is
to
say
obviously
there
is
a
significant
difference
i
would
suggest
in
the
standard
of
pertinency
which
might
properly
be
applied,
in
the
case
of
the
congressional
committee
investigating
a
present
plot
to
blow
up
the
white
house
and
questioning
of
the
kind
here
involved
which
seeks
only
information
concerning
remote,
lawful
political
activity.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
i've
said
to
this
point
is
relevant
in
judging
the
petitioner's
private
interest,
that
is
to
say
faced
as
he
was
with
these
questions,
i
think
that
he
might
well
feel
himself
fortified
in
asserting
his
reasons
of
personal
privacy
by
the
fact
that
what
the
committees
sought
was
remote
in
time,
concerned
lawful
activity
and
had
--
could
shed
little
light
on
the
national
security.
but
the
--
i
cannot
improve
on
the
petitioner's
own
statement
of
the
urgent,
compelling
personal,
private
reasons
which
led
him
to
decline
to
answer
these
questions.
i
would
only
ask
that
your
honors
recall
that
this
inquiry
took
place
in
1956.
this
was
at
time
when
the
country
was
beginning
to
emerge
from
that
era
of
our
history
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
we
call
mccarthyism.
for
months,
for
years
prior
to
this
hearing,
the
public
prints
have
been
full
of
innocent
law
abiding
citizens
who
had
been
humiliated,
persecuted,
vilified
sometimes
even
to
the
point
of
suicide
and
death
because
i
have
been
revealed
before
one
or
another
of
these
committees.
the
petitioner's
fears
that
his
answers
to
these
questions
might
bring
harm
to
innocent
persons
were
not
factitious
or
contrived
notions.
they
were
headlines
of
the
time
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
if
under
the
barenblatt
balancing
test,
the
desire
of
a
citizen
to
avoid
unjustified
harm
to
innocent
people
is
not
a
sufficient
justification
of
personal
privacy
then
none
will
ever
be
found.
this
moral,
this
epical,
this
humane,
this
disinteresting
reason
for
declining
to
answer,
is
the
most
compelling
reason
that
this
court
will
ever
have
put
before
it.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
your
honor
--
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
i
trust,
i
understand
that
your
honor
and
i
can
only
say
that
as
counsel,
i
feel
bound
by
the
previous
announcements
of
this
court
which
it
seems
to
me
have
clearly
phrased
this
problem
in
terms
of
accomplishing
a
balancing
between
the
public
interest
that
was
to
be
served;
the
national
security,
if
that
was
affected;
and
the
individual's
reason
for
asserting
his
personal
privacy.
now,
this
it
seems
to
me,
if
this
is
the
true
test
of
mrs.
barenblatt,
as
i
read
it,
then
your
honor
i
think
it
becomes
impossible
to
generalize
to
without
knowing
all
the
facts
which
surround
the
case
that
your
honor
puts.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
you
have
and
i
suggest
that
you
have
this
discretion
by
a
commitment
from
the
congress.
the
congress
which
as
the
discussion
this
morning
brought
out
might
have
punished
directly
for
contempt
has
entrusted
that
power
to
the
federal
judiciary
and
then
doing
so
the
congress
has
imposed
certain
restraints
on
itself
which
are
expressed
in
the
statute.
the
committee
must
be
authorized,
the
questions
must
be
pertinent.
there
is,
your
honor,
no
question
of
limiting
the
congress
in
its
power
of
investigation.
obviously,
the
congress
does
not
want
unauthorized
investigations
going
on.
the
congress
does
not
want
impertinent
questions
asked
and
it
said
so
in
statute.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
yes,
senate
committee,
your
honor.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
there's
an
important
distinction
to
be
drawn
here.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
in
the
case
--
in
the
kilbourn
against
thompson
situation
where
you
were
dealing
with
habeas
corpus,
you
are
dealing
with
a
particular
exercise
of
congressional
discretion
in
the
particular
manner
and
i
assume
that
your
honors
would
respect
that
exercise
of
discretion.
in
this
case,
you
are
dealing
with
a
prosecution
brought
under
a
statute
which
the
congress
has
adopted
in
which
the
congress
has
fixed
the
standards
to
be
applied
by
the
federal
judiciary,
where
the
discretion
is
were
not
to
be
exercised
by
the
congress,
but
under
the
very
terms
of
itself,
is
to
be
exercised
by
the
federal
judiciary.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
well,
your
honor
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
those
two
that
congress
might
well
have
felt
that
it
was
proper
where
a
person
had
been
genuinely
guilty
of
contempt
of
congress
that
he
be
given
a
sentence
which
would
not
expire
at
the
end
of
the
congressional
term
and
the
congress,
at
the
same
time
to
say,
that
we
will
setup
certain
restraints
on
our
own
action
to
be
enforced
through
the
federal
judiciary
for
our
own
self
protection,
namely,
we
do
not
wish
to
have
unauthorized
committees
going
around
holding
hearings.
we
do
not
wish
to
have
congressmen
or
senators
asking
impertinent
questions.
we
ask
the
aid
of
the
federal
judiciary
in
imposing
on
ourselves
these
limitations
for
the
best
of
possible
reasons.
now,
i
think
that
there's
no
inconsistency,
your
honor,
between
those
two
and
to
suggest
that
the
congress
was
doing
nothing
but
being
blind
to
the
interest
of
the
citizen
in
this
case
in
adopting
the
statute,
i
think
carries
it
much
too
far.
i
think
the
congress
can
be
credited
with
the
same
interest
in
protecting
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
citizen
as
this
court
is
and
there
is
no
reason
why
the
congress
cannot
seek
the
aid
of
the
judiciary
precisely
in
protecting
the
constitutional
rights.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
well,
your
honor,
just
have
one
observation
to
that
question
and
that
is
that
the
congress
has
the
greatest
practical
difficulty
in
enforcing
these
restraints
on
itself.
this
is
a
large
body.
all
kinds
of
committee
sit
in
all
kinds
of
capacities.
these
are
legal
problems.
they
are
constitutional
problems
and
i
suggest
the
to
you
that
nothing
is
more
probable
than
that
the
congress
specifically
desire
the
aid
and
counsel
of
the
judiciary
in
protecting
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
citizen
and
that
it
is
wrong
to
suppose
that
these
limitations
are
limitations
which
the
judiciary
puts
on
the
investigating
rights
of
congress
that
they
are
in
effect
restraints
which
the
congress
has
been
put
on
itself
and
which
it
seeks
the
aid
of
the
federal
courts
and
administer.
if
your
honors
please,
the
inquisition
has
always
had
an
insatiable
appetite
for
names
whether
it
be
torquemada
or
titus
oates,
cotton
mather
or
savannah
rolla
or
lavrenti
beria
or
heinrich
himmler,
there
is
an
impelling
necessity
to
seek
ever
longer
lists
of
names
because
only
in
this
way
can
may
color
the
pretense
that
there
is
a
monstrous
conspiracy
against
the
state
of
which
they
and
they
alone
are
the
true
defendants.
as
this
lust
for
names
increases,
all
forms
of
due
process
are
forgotten.
all
questions
of
guilt
or
innocence
become
irrelevant.
all
questions
of
humanity
or
decent
treatment
of
one
citizen
by
another
disappear
until
finally
the
child
informs
on
its
parents,
the
student
on
its
professors,
the
wife
on
her
husband
and
finally
the
guilty
and
the
innocent
alike
walk
to
the
state
or
the
scaffold
or
to
the
tumbrel
or
to
the
death
chamber.
and
it
precisely
at
this
point
that
the
citizen
standing
up
and
saying,
i
acknowledge
my
responsibility
for
my
acts.
i
will
answer
for
myself
and
what
you
wish
to
know
of
me
you
shall
learn,
but
i
will
not
become
an
accomplice
in
your
desire.
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
dramatic
clash
between
the
felt
needs
of
the
inquisition
and
the
ethical,
the
moral,
the
religious
impulse
of
the
citizen
rise
to
their
dramatic
climax.
and
it
is
precisely
at
that
point
that
the
determination
must
be
made
as
it
has
always
been
made
whether
or
not
the
net
of
suspicion
shall
be
thrown
ever
wider,
drawing
in
successively
larger
numbers
of
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
or
whether
or
not
the
line
of
inquiry
shall
be
held
within
the
bounds
of
a
civilized
and
orderly
society.
i
urge
that
your
honors
draw
that
line
in
this
case
by
reversing
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
your
honor,
at
each
stage
of
this
proceeding,
the
government
has
relied
on
a
different
question
or
group
of
questions
to
sustain
the
verdict
below.
here,
it
relies
on
count
7
and
i
would
make
two
observations
with
respect
to
that
particular
question.
the
first
is
what
to
question
is
not
have
the
committee
inquired
of
the
petitioner
do
you
know
whether
or
not
there
are
presently
any
communists
employed
at
the
herald
tribune?
the
petitioner
would
almost
certainly
have
answered
the
question
and
almost
equally
certainly
would
have
answered
it
no
because
he
left
the
party
some
eight
years
before
he
left
the
herald
tribune
five
years
before
and
such
a
question
would
not
be
a
question
that
sought
the
identification
of
any
person
who
had
been
associated
within
the
party.
this
question
while
couched
in
present
terms
is
actually
an
effort
to
go
back
once
more
to
the
time
when
he
was
in
the
communist
party
in
1948.
the
second
observation
i
would
make
is
that
the
petitioner
had
made
it
entirely
clear
to
the
committee
by
the
most
exact
statement
that
he
would
answer
any
questions
asked
in
of
the
committee
--
by
the
committee
except
questions
which
sought
names.
now,
if
the
purpose
of
this
question
was
something
other
than
to
seek
names,
and
i
suggest
that
a
reasonable
witness
would
conclude
that
it
was
a
question
which
was
designed
to
elicit
names
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
common
fairness,
the
committee
should
have
informed
petitioner
that
that
was
not
the
question,
not
the
purpose
of
asking
a
question,
but
they
did
not
go
--
intend
to
go
on
and
ask
the
obvious
next
question
namely,
who
are
those
persons
and
the
rest
of
it.
i
think
it
was
no
under
--
misunderstanding
on
this
matter
either
by
the
members
of
the
committee
or
by
the
petitioner
and
i
think
that
any
explication
of
the
purpose
of
the
question,
if
it
was
other
than
to
seek
the
naming
of
names
was
due
to
the
petitioner.
thank
you
your
honor.
