do
you

do
you
agree

justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
that
he
was
indicted
for
refusing
to
answer
three
questions
to
be
answered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
question
of
balancing
that
you
would
put
on
each
side
of
the
scale?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
understand
you
to
list
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
know
if
it
is
implicit
in
any
that
you
add
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
the
simplicity
on
any
of
those
you're
suggesting.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
must
not
you
--
must
you
not
reach
that
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
it
does
or
not,
you
would
have
to
meet
the
question
of
balancing,
would
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you'd
have
to
meet
it
if
you
want
to
convict
him
on
one
of
these,
would
you
not,
that
he
has
raised
the
question
in
the
first
amendment.
justice

you
say

what?
justice

l.
black
what
case
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
shelton
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
you
proved
it,
did
you
say
you
proved
what
you
are
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
â€“
where
is
the
proof
in
the
record
if
you
will?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
--
is
that
affidavit
of
the
court
that
you
--
to
which
you
refer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far
does
that
go
now?
i
just
want
to
know
in
fact
the
(voice

affidavits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
want
to
--
your
time
is
up.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
know
it
is
sir,
your
honor
and
if
you
begin
with
record
number
12,
12
and
13
particularly
and
read
the
quoted
material.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
that
doesn't
necessarily
almost
lead
to
the
necessity
for
a
witness
as
distinguished
from
a
defendant
carrying
a
lawyer
with
him
when
he
goes
to
the
committee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you're
talking
about
this
particular
type
of
witness,
but
there
are
many
witnesses
that
go
before
committed.
they
are
--
they
have
their
legal
rights
waived
because
they
don't
have
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
of
some
(inaudible)
to
the
charge
that
they're
really
not
investigating
but
tried.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
reason
i
asked
you
the
question
was,
i
assumed
that
it
would
have
to
apply
to
any
committee
and
that
would
mean
that
the
witness
that's
summoned
before
any
committee,
state
or
federal,
would
always,
if
they
really
protect
their
constitutional
rights,
bring
a
lawyer
with
them.
if
they
have
any
claims
to
make.
those
--
few
laymen
would
know
how
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
that
you
--
it's
your
contention
to
that
is
framed
as
a
general
rule
that
no
witness
before
a
committee
can
never
raise
any
objection
or
what's
asked?
if
he
didn't
raise
it
before
the
committee,
is
there
a
moment
to
ask
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
sure
that
you
could
carry
that
--
what
you
seem
to
make
its
logical
extent.
supposed
gotten
him
in
there
and
took
him
with
force
threats
to
his
personal
safety,
to
make
a
statement
and
that
he's
been
indicted
for
that.
would
you
say
that
it
makes
no
difference
that
--
that
--
that
he
couldn't
save
himself
from
such
a
prosecution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
he
had
not
objected
to
it
on
the
ground
it
was
illegal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
interrogated
--
i
don't
know
--
with
threats
that
he
would
receive
bodily
injury
if
he
didn't
testify,
would
you
say
that
he
was
indicted
for
refusing
to
testify
there
that
he
couldn't
raise
that
question
because
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
hadn't
raised
it
before
the
committee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
could
get
it
routed
by
that
legal
maneuver
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
whole
figure
that
you
just
wouldn't
you
say
that
you
--
your
argument
doesn't
go
that
far,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
so?
i
thought
you'd
go
a
little
further
than
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
logically
explain
or
could
logically
determine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
number
count
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
you
are
limiting
it
to
one
count,
which
one
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
printed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
that's
the
proper
way
of
stating
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
the
proper
way
of
stating
the
balancing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
said
twice,
meaning
the
government's
interest
and
you
haven't
said
in
what
--
and
the
private
interest
of
the
party.
i
presume
you
would
have
to
balance
the
government's
interest
getting
this
particular
information,
this
particular
power
in
connection
with
its
prospects
in
passage
of
the
law
against
private
interest
of
the
man
plus
the
government's
interest
in
seeing
that
laws
do
not
interfere
with
the
rights
of
associations,
and
expressions
and
beliefs.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
say
that
you're
not
quite
meeting
the
inquiry
i
made
and
maybe
i'm
wrong
in
making
it.
you're
depending
on
one
question
and
you
say
you're
going
to
balance
the
interest
of
the
government
in
getting
this
information
which
is,
as
the
numbers
that
you
associate
within
the
cell,
do
you
know
whether
any
of
them
are
still
employed
with
the
herald
tribune?
as
i
understand
it,
you
can't
--
you're
not
to
discuss
that
on
a
generalized
basis,
case
by
case
balancing.
what
you're
interested
in
here
you
say
that
they
have
the
right
to
pass
some
law
that
this
would
be
helpful.
i
would
suppose
in
putting
your
balance,
you
would
have
to
show
why
they
need
this
particular
information
in
order
to
pass
some
law
that
they
had
a
right
to
pass,
not
in
general
about
the
investigation
but
what
is
that
in
the
record
to
show
that
on
balance,
the
committee
actually
needed
to
know
the
name
of
the
person
that
he
had
associated
with,
a
particular
person
it's
not
indicated
there
were
many,
they
had
to
do
that.
is
there
any
information
that
they
didn't
know
already
know
the
name?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
knew
the
names,
i
suppose
you
would
not
say
that
they
simply
needed
him
--
they
needed
that
to
pass
the
law
if
they
already
had
the
names,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
they
already
knew
who
they
were,
would
you
claim
that
they
knew
who
they
were,
the
interest
of
the
government
was
so
great
in
having
this
particular
man
repeat
their
names
in
public
that
it
was
so
great
to
inform
them
on
how
to
pass
the
law.
they
have
him
do
that
formal
useless
thing
that
would
outweigh
his
interest,
and
the
public's
interest
in
seeing
that
their
first
amendment
freedom
is
observed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
whose
duty
is
it
to
show
that
with
reference
to
the
balancing
of
constitutional
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
not?
you
have
--
you
have
limited
yourself
to
one
count
which
seems
to
ask
the
man
and
you
say
that
that
source
essentially
outweighs
the
first
amendment
right
to
ask
him
if
he
knows
whether
any
of
these
people
are
still
employed
for
the
herald
tribune.
suppose
they
already
had
the
information
from
that
informant
or
some
others,
it's
exactly
who
they
were.
would
you
still
say
that
they
could
make
him
answer
this
question
and
would
balance
it
against
his
rights
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
they
need
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
they
had
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
it's
conceded
that
they
had
it.
suppose
they
actually
had
it
in
their
record,
they
simply
wanted
him
to
testify
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
under
those
circumstances
that
the
interest
of
the
government
in
having
him
make
that
statement
publicly
outweighs
the
public's
interest
in
the
faithful
observance
of
the
freedoms
for
the
first
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
--
can
that
be
true
even
though
you
do
not
know
what
kind
of
legislation
could
be
passed
on
this,
based
on
the
simple
fact
that
he
had
publicly
stated
that
which
they
already
knew
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
free
press?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
suppose
they're
special
favors
by
the
first
amendment
too,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
suppose
to
enjoy
some
special
favor
by
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
limit
that
to
the
private
interest
and
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
a
particular
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
agreeing
that
when
you
put
in
balance
the
right
of
a
public
to
get
evidence
against
the
right
of
a
person
to
have
his
first
amendment
freedom,
that
there
might
not
be
a
considerable
difference
between
a
murder
case
where
a
witness'
evidence
is
essential
in
order
to
determine
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
a
man
and
in
a
hearing
before
some
agency
or
some
investigating
committee
where
the
relevance
is
there,
what
hangs
on
that,
whether
that
evidence
is
needed
for
the
purpose
of
passing
a
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
don't
you
answer
then?
i
don't
see
why
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
a
protection,
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
if
you
do
not
understand
what's
called
a
balancing
test
to
have
been
based
on
the
--
this
premise,
that
any
time
a
witness
is
called
on
to
answer
questions
that's
made
trenched
close
to
his
first
amendment
rights,
that
then
comes
a
question
of
balancing
and
i
suppose,
although
i
agree
with
you
that
the
test
weight
might
be
quite
different
with
reference
to
a
committee
or
administrative
agency
and
court,
but
i
suppose
that
rule
would
no
less
be
applied
in
the
court.
if
the
court's
balancing
test
is
a
genuine
test,
in
that
when
it
appears
even
in
court
that,
by
the
introduction
of
certain
evidence,
the
--
it's
going
to
treat
somebody's
first
amendment
right,
the
court
would
consider
in
determining
the
admissibility
of
that
evidence.
but,
it
was
necessary
to
balance
the
interest,
i
suppose,
under
that
test
of
the
public
in
getting
that
evidence
against
the
interest
of
the
public
in
protecting
first
amendment
rights
if
the
test
is
truly
followed.

to

for
what
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
--
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
barenblatt
before
that,
and
you
had
decided
many
things
that
i
did
agree
with
but
i
had
not
suspect
and
do
not
yet
know
that
it
decided
once
and
for
all
every
question
that's
asked
by
this
committee
is
legitimate,
whether
it's
relevant
in
a
particular
incident
to
aid
the
committee
in
making
law
or
not.
did
you
so
understand
the
barenblatt
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
that
it
could
or
attempted
to
decide
for
all
time,
this
being
a
legitimate
committee,
in
barenblatt,
it
was
legitimate
in
all
the
cases
to
ask
the
question
which
might
come
up
in
the
next
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you're
trying
to
argue
within
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
indictment
printed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
appendix?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
conviction
on
all
the
count?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
was
not?
justice
hugo

black
when
--
where
they
said
he
had
refused
to
tell
whether
his

would
be
coming?
justice

black
did
jury
acquit
on
that?
justice
hugo

black
dismiss?
justice
hugo

black
did
you
put
it
all
in
your
brief
what
you
find?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
motion?
if
it
takes
you
too
long,
don't
bother
then
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
argument
here
in
connection
with
that
ground
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
which
allege
that
there
had
only
been
one
offense
committed,
instead
of
15?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
been
abandoned
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
cited
the
legislative
history
which
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
citation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
there
been
many
committees
that
examined
and
the
same
subject
matter
that
these
committees
have
examined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
where
is
the
particular
statement
on
which
they
relied
that
it
is
abusiveness?
justice
hugo

black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
court
of

opinion.
i
want
to
see
it
in
