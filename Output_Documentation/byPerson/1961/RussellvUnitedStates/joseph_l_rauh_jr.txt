mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
what
is
under
review
here
is
the
conviction
of
petitioner,
robert
shelton,
a
copyeditor
on
the
new
york
times
for
contempt
of
congress
in
refusing
to
answer
two
questions
concerning
communism
put
to
him
by
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee
in
1956.
petitioner,
despite
an
unblemished
record
and
his
ability
to
keep
his
job
was
sentenced
to
six
months
in
jail
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
section.
the
facts
are
these.
it's
hard
to
know
just
how
this
investigation
got
started,
but
since
chairman
eastland
suggested
that
it
starts
with
a
man
winston
burdett,
we
will
assume
that
in
someway,
the
overall
investigation
got
started
through
him.
in
june
of
1955,
winston
burdett,
a
cbs
radio
commentator
testified
before
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee
in
the
course
of
hearings
on
strategy
and
tactics
of
world
communism,
he
revealed
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
the
late
30's
and
early
40's
when
he
had
been
employed
by
the
brooklyn
eagle.
he
did
not
mention
petitioner
nor,
and
the
record
is
clear
on
this,
has
anyone
ever
at
any
time
mentioned
petitioner
in
any
public
hearing.
as
to
the
private
hearing,
we
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
well,
mr.
burdett
testified
in
june
of
1955,
in
november
--
on
november
24,
1955,
an
aide
of
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee
showed
up
at
the
new
york
times
with
30
subpoenas
under
his
arm
for
an
executive
session
of
that
committee
on
december
7,
1955.
in
order
to
make
it
easier
to
find
the
people
in
new
york
times,
had
assigned
a
man
to
help
locate
them.
so
the
aide
of
the
committee
went
to
this
man
and
showed
him
some
names
and
they
finally
got
to
a
name,
a
subpoena
for
a
man
named
willard
shelton,
a
nationally
known
columnist.
“well,”
said
the
man
who
was
in
the
times,
“there
isn't
any.
we
have
no
willard
shelton.”
so
there
must
have
been
some
talk
and
it
isn't
clear
and
then
the
man
said,
“we
have
a
few
others.
we
have
one
--
we
have
some
in
the
typo
side,
we
have
one
on
the
news
or
editorial
side.”
so
the
aide
of
the
committee
says,
“what's
his
name?”
he
says,
“well,
it's
robert
shelton.”
so
the
committee
aide
wasn't
clear
what
to
do
so
he
called
back
to
the
--
subcommittee,
talked
to
the
subcommittee
counsel,
mr.
sourwine,
who
talked
to
chairman
eastland
who
said,
“tell
him
to
come.”
so
the
subcommittee
aide
took
the
subpoena
and
he
wrote
--
and
it
had
in
it
--
typed-in
“willard
shelton”
and
he
wrote-in
“or
robert
shelton”
and
the
man
was
brought
in
to
receive
his
subpoena.
now,
let
me
make
it
perfectly
clear
here
and
now,
we
are
not
raising
a
technical
question
of
whether
the
subpoena
is
legal.
they
had
issued
another
one
we
haven't
--
that's
of
no
significance.
what
is
of
significance
of
course
is
the
whole
case
then
began
to
revolve
around
the
fact
that
the
committee
had
no
probable
or
any
other
type
of
cause
for
calling
him.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
on
this
december
7,
1955,
he
appeared
in
the
executive
session
pursuant
to
this
subpoena.
no,
i
want
to
be
more
accurate.
they
gave
him
another
subpoena
just
for
himself.
he
could
have
one
all
by
himself
but
the
--
before
december
7th,
they
had
given
him
another
subpoena
just
for
robert
shelton
and
he
did
appear
on
december
7,
1955
before
the
executive
session.
after
preliminary
questions
of
the
most
routine
nature,
he
was
asked
to
answer
the
question
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
said,
i
--
he
pleaded
the
first
amendment,
the
scope
for
the
committee's
authority
and
he
said,
“the
actual
basis
for
the
inquiry
has
not
been
stated
to
me
nor
does
it
appear
on
the
subpoena.”
a
very
significant
thing
then
happened.
subcommittee
counsel
mr.
sourwine
said,
“i
am
greatly
surprised.
this
witness
was
not
charged
with
being
a
communist
and
i
am
surprised
that
he
has
taken
this
attitude
or
refusing
to
answer
this
question.”
that
more
or
less
wound
up
with
a
little
more,
the
executive
session,
and
that
is
not
the
session
from
which
the
indictment
flowed.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
do
not
sir.
and
of
course,
this
was
his
way
of
saying
it
wasn't
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
he
hasn't
at
all
--
they
did
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
do
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
do
not
if
your
honor
please
in
my
experience
with
the
house
on
un-american
activities
committee,
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee,
or
the
mcclellan
labor
investigating
committee,
but
at
least
with
the
latter
i
can
say
that
if
you
were
to
inquire,
you
would
get
very
specific
information.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
well,
he
was
told
he
would
have
to
come
back
in
open
session
and
he
returned
on
january
6,
1956
in
open
session
and
this
is
the
session
from
which
the
indictment
flowed.
well,
petitioner
quickly
said,
“i
challenge
the
jurisdiction.
i
have
no
information
to
give
you.
i
failed
to
see
why
i'm
involved
in
this
hearing.”
and
then
above
all
he
said,
“i
am
a
victim
of
accident.
you
subpoenaed
willard
shelton.
i
was
the
shelton
that
was
there.
i
was
called.”
well,
they
told
him
nothing.
they
just
said
this
--
as
mr.
sourwine
put
it
on
page
84
of
the
transcript,
“this
is
absurd,
answer
the
questions,”
which
he
then
declined
to
do.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
on
these
--
all
of
these
your
honor,
the
first
amendment,
the
jurisdiction,
victim
of
accident.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh
incrimi
--
self-incrimination,
no
your
honor.
it's
only
those
who
plead
the
fifth
amendment
that
don't
come
here,
the
self-incrimination
is
those
who
don't
plead
self-incrimination
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
that
come
here,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
we
were
not
his
counsel
but
he
did
have
counsel.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
he
refused
to
answer
three
questions,
two
of
which
he
was
indicted
and
two
of
which
he's
been
convicted
for.
he
was
indicted
for
three,
“are
you
a
member
of
the
party?
did
you
have
a
certain
conversation
with
a
certain
person?”
and
both
these,
he
refused
to
answer,
both
of
these
he
was
convicted
for.
now
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
but
very
--
all
about
his
education
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
where
he's
been.
of
course
he
answered
he's
been
on
pm,
just
made
the
victim
of
accident
thing
clear
because
when
they
asked
him,
“have
you
been
on
pm?
”it's
perfectly
clear
they
were
thinking
of
willard
shelton
who
has
of
course
been
a
very
distinguished
writer
for
the
newspaper.
well,
the
trial
started
in
january
1957
on
the
indictment
for
his
refusal
to
answer
these
two
questions
and
it
was
clear
to
everyone
that
our
major
defense
would
be
probable
cause.
so
we
issued
a
subpoena
for
all
the
information
they
have
on
their
--
in
their
files
about
robert
shelton
at
the
time
they
called
him.
what
we
wanted
to
do
is
to
get
a
concession.
they
didn't
have
any.
we
thought
that
be
the
end
of
the
case.
the
judge
--
the
government
argued,
“oh,
you
can't
have
that
because
we
don't
need
probable
cause.”
the
judge
quashed
the
subpoena
so
we
went
to
trial.
the
prosecution
started
in
by
this
statement.
we
do
not
have
to
prove
probable
cause
because
a
congressional
committee
can
call
the
man
off
the
street.
that's
on
page
40
of
the
record
because
i
thought
maybe
you
wouldn't
believe
me
that
a
representative
of
the
united
states
of
america
had
said,
“we
can
call
a
man
off
the
street.”
but
he
said
--
i
must
say,
i
said
that
was
shocking
then,
and
i
feel
the
same
way
now,
and
i'm
going
to
show
that
this
is
essentially
what
the
position
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
today
in
this
court.
but
he
said,
“i'm
not
going
to
just
rely
on
the
man
off
the
street
doctrine.
i
want
to
prove
that
we
had
probable
cause.”
so
he
called
subcommittee
counsel
sourwine.
now
remember
that
in
1957,
at
the
executive
session,
subcommittee
counsel
sourwine
said,
“i'm
greatly
surprised
when
this
man
--
when
petitioner
refused
to
answer,”
and
said,
“this
witness
is
not
accused
of
being
a
communist.”
then
a
year
later
at
the
trial,
mr.
sourwine
made
a
180
degree
shift.
he
remembered
a
letter,
a
letter
with
an
informant
pseudonym
x
which
had
been
received
by
the
committee
within
one
to
three
months
prior
to
the
december
1955
executive
session.
now,
all
that
he
could
remember
about
this
letter
was
this
one
sentence
approximately
as
i
give
it
to
you
now,
from
this
informant
pseudonym
x.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
oh,
no,
no,
that's
the
whole
point
in
the
case
your
honor,
is
they
wouldn't
give
us
the
letter.
mr.
sourwine's
testimony
and
maybe
the
best
place
to
show
you
what
he
said
about
this
is
record
98
and
about
two
lines
or
three
lines
--
three
questions
down,
the
answer
--
it's
fully
on
132
on
page
98.
the
committee
had
at
the
time
when
subpoena
was
issued
information
that
a
man
named
shelton
who
was
employed
in
the
news
department
or
city
side
of
the
new
york
times,
who's
a
member
of
a
communist
group
on
the
time,
was
active
in
the
affairs
of
that
group
and
would
be
or
should
be
in
a
position
to
give
the
committee
information
about
the
activities
of
that
group.
and
then
down
below
at
the
very
bottom,
you
will
see
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
came
by
a
letter
--
the
very
bottom
of
the
page
there,
five
lines
up.
now
--
so,
although
he
had
said
in
december
1955,
he
was
surprised,
although
he
had
said
that
the
man
was
not
accused
of
--
of
saying
--
being
a
communist,
he
now
says
that
within
one
to
three
months
before
that
time,
they've
gotten
this
letter
with
the
pseudonym
with
this
information.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
january
1957,
about
a
year
later.
he
couldn't
--
he'd
been
surprised
that
--
well,
naturally,
on
cross-examination,
we
brought
out
the
inconsistencies
and
the
incredibility
of
mr.
sourwine's
testimony.
we
asked
him,
“why
did
you
issue
it
to
willard
shelton
if
you
had
no
name
there?”
oh,
no
answer.
“why
were
you
surprised
if
you
had
this
letter?
why
did
--
why
did
you
say
he
wasn't
accused
of
--
being
a
communist
if
you
had
a
letter
that
said
he
was
accused?”
he
said
there
were
1500
or
1800
names
in
this
letter.
so
we
asked
him,
“can
you
tell
us
anything
else
about
this
letter
except
this
one
sentence?”
no,
he
remembered
nothing
about
the
letter
except
the
one
sentence
and
look
at
the
coincidence
of
that
one
sentence
he
could
remember.
it
was
just
those
things
that
would
rationalize,
having
issued
a
subpoena
to
willard
shelton
and
called
a
man
named
robert
shelton.
it
rationalized
that
we
didn't
have
his
first
name,
and
he
was
on
the
news
side
of
the
times.
actually,
he
is
not,
he
is
the
copyeditor,
not
in
the
editorial
side
because
the
news
side,
it
was
(inaudible),
but
that's
--
i
don't
make
anything.
i'm
only
showing
that
in
our
judgment
we
have
proved
it
was
fabricated.
now
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
didn't
do
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
no,
no.
he
said
--
he
said
they
had
a
letter.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
said
that
mr.
robert
morris
had
it
at
the
time
he
was
(inaudible)
--
well
of
course,
your
honor,
you
see
the
next
step.
we
asked
him
the
letter.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
--
that's
just
what
exactly
where
i
was.
obviously,
he's
saying
he
had
this
letter.
now,
we
were
entitled
to
this
letter
under
the
sixth
amendment
whether
i
had
been
able
to
demonstrate
on
cross-examination
a
prima
facie
case
that
this
was
a
manufactured
testimony,
we
were
entitled
to
it
anyway.
but
i
thought
it's
advisable
to
be
cautious
and
so
we
first
proved
that
it
was
manu
--
we
first
made
a
prima
facie
case
of
incredibility
of
the
witness,
then
we
asked
for
the
letter.
we
asked
for
the
letter
four
times.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
mr.
sourwine
refused
to
produce
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh
yes
your
honor.
we
kept
asking
the
judge.
but
mr.
sourwine
kept
saying
he
wouldn't
produce
it
and
the
judge
was
in
this
dilemma.
there
is
nothing
confidential
about
the
letter
anyway
because
there
is
a
pseudonym.
we
couldn't
--
and
we're
not
now
talking
about
an
informant's
privilege
because
we
haven't
reached
that
yet.
the
letter
itself
doesn't
giveaway
anything.
it's
a
--
it
had
a
pseudonym.
the
judge
had
this
dilemma.
sourwine
said,
he
wasn't
--
he
wouldn't
produce
the
letter.
the
judge,
we
told
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
judge
was
mr.
--
judge
rizley
of
a
--
a
visiting
judge
at
this
time
and
so
the
judge
had
this
dilemma.
he
wasn't
sure
exactly
--
he
saw
our
point
that
sixth
amendment
gave
us
the
right
to
the
letter,
but
he
said,
“i
don't
think
you
need
probable
cause
anyway
and
so
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
the
letter.”
and
then
a
little
later,
the
judge
said
to
me
at
one
time,
he
said,
“mr.
rauh,
i've
got
a
theory
of
probable
cause.
the
probable
cause
at
the
open
hearing
comes
from
the
closed
hearing.”
and
i
said,
“yes,
your
honor.
but
under
silverthorne
and
nardone,
you
couldn't
possibly
use
the
fruits
of
one
wrongful
calling
to
make
a
rightful
calling”
and
i
guess
i
scared
him
off
with
that
because
there's
nothing
in
the
opinion
at
the
end
making
that
point
and
the
government
doesn't
raise
it
here
and
of
course
they
couldn't
because
it
wasn't
their
theory
of
probable
cause.
the
only
theory
of
probable
cause
that's
been
offered
at
the
trial
was
mr.
sourwine's
theory
that
he
had
a
letter
which
we
said
he
didn't
have
and
which
he
wouldn't
produce.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
was
a
judge
at
that
time.
i
don't
know
whether
--
i
don't
know
whether
he's
available
or
not.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
he
was
a
judge
in
the
court,
in
a
municipal
court
in
new
york,
if
your
honor
please.
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
after
all
this
--
all
this
--
this
--
the
court
then
makes
its
decision.
and
the
court
says,
“it's
not
judiciably
reviewable.
you
don't
--
we
won't
look.”
and
the
court
makes
its
basic
decision
that
you
don't
--
the
government
does
not
have
to
prove
probable
cause
when
challenged.
he
did
say
as
afterthought
that
the
--
that
the
committee
could
call
anybody
off
the
times.
after
all
he
said
there
was
some
testimony
of
communism
off
the
times,
therefore
you
could
anybody
and
that's
probable
cause.
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
i
think
this
is
where
he's
looking
at
on
page
244
of
the
record,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is,
“you
can
call
anybody
off
the
working
press
because
there
was
evidence
of
communism
on
the
working
press.”
in
other
words,
they
said,
“you
can
call
anybody
you
want
from
the
newspaper
industry
because
there
was
some
evidence
that
were
some
communists
in
the
newspaper
industry.”
this
is
--
this
is
on
page
244.
after
the
important
revelations
of
(inaudible)
which
i
told
you
where
there
had
been
communists
in
the
brooklyn
eagle
in
the
1930's
and
early
1940's,
that
were
surely
not
a
dragnet
process
to
call
upon
as
a
member
of
the
working
press
to
check
on
possible
communist
party
activities
among
his
fellow
employees.
well,
as
you
can
guess,
the
government
has
dropped
that
theory.
the
government
has
completely
dropped
any
thought
that
you
could
say
it
was
probable
cause
to
call
a
man
at
random
off
the
press
because
there
was
some
other
communists
on
the
press.
they
don't
argue
that
in
this
court,
therefore,
the
theory
of
the
--
of
the
affirmance
has
been
dropped.
the
theory
of
the
judge
in
which
he
tried
once,
but
then
dropped
that
you
could
get
probable
cause
from
a
bad
calling
has
been
dropped.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
contemplate
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
contemplated,
if
your
honor
please,
two
things.
i
contemplate
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
witness
will
have
testimony
pertinent
to
the
matter
under
inquiry.
probable
cause
that
the
witness
will
have
testimony
pertinent
to
the
question
under
inquiry,
that's
what
i
mean
by
it.
the
government
as
i'm
coming
to,
has
a
diluted
theory
which
i
would
like
to
come
to,
but
to
me
probable
cause
means
probability
that
this
man
will
have
evidence
pertinent
and
relevant
to
the
question
under
inquiry.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
at
least
when
challenged,
if
your
honor
please.
i
know,
i
would
--
if
you
haven't
challenged
it
and
we
haven't
made
probable
cause
an
issue,
i
don't
say
they
would
have
had
to
prove
it.
i
don't
--
i
haven't
--
i
don't
have
to
carry
such
a
burden.
maybe
they
would
have,
but
in
this
case,
i
shall
probable
cause
before
trial,
at
trial,
court
of
appeals
and
as
you
can
see,
i
--
i'm
relying
on
it
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh,
precisely
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'm
relying
on
the
fourth
and
first
and
the
fifth.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'm
not
--
that
is
not
my
reading
of
those
cases
because
if
you
take
even
the
roviaro
case,
this
court's
statement
there
on
the
--
on
a
very
identical
point
your
honor
was
in
probable
cause
cases,
“the
government
has
been
required
to
disclose
the
identity
of
the
informant
when
there
was
sufficient
evidence
apart
from
his
confidential
communication.”
we're
not
even
asking
for
that
far.
we're
simply
asking
that
the
sixth
amendment
apply
to
a
document
which
we
were
--
which
first,
would
apply
whether
i
had
demonstrated
that
mr.
sourwine
was
prime
facie
not
telling
the
truth,
and
second,
whether
it
would
be
a
fortiori
when
you'd
made
this
much
of
a
case,
your
honors.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
oh
man,
not
--
not
at
all.
we
put
probable
cause
an
issue.
mr.
sourwine
testified
it's
all
wrapped
up
in
one
little
piece
of
paper.
certainly,
we
have
the
right
to
that
piece
of
paper.
the
sixth
amendment
is
--
is
--
is
not
applicable
on
a
criminal
trial.
now,
the
government
drops
what
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
but
it's
got
four
arguments
here
and
i
like
to
take
them
up
one-by-one
and
maybe
i
could
come
back
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
i
met
this
confrontation
sir.
now,
the
government
makes
four
arguments
here,
dropping
the
one
that
court
of
appeals
relied
on
and
the
afterthought
of
the
district
court.
the
government,
first,
says,
“we
didn't
raise
it.”
now
honestly,
when
you
come
in
and
say
you're
a
victim
of
accident,
when
--
well,
as
matter
of
fact,
what
the
government
says
that
we
didn't
raise
it,
they
admit.
i
must
say
the
government
sometimes
--
it
kind
of
amazes
me.
the
government
says,
“you
raised
probable
cause.”
they
concede
this
at
pages
14
and
30
of
their
brief.
we
raised
probable
cause
but
that
doesn't
raise
the
fourth
amendment.
what
kind
of
a
--
a
pleading
--
this
isn't
--
it
was
robert
shelton
that
went
before
that
committee,
not
sergeant
hawkins
in
common
law
pleading.
the
government
admits,
“we
raised
probable
cause”
and
said,
“we
didn't
raise
the
fourth
amendment.”
well
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
confrontation,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
of
the
witness
--
by
the
witness
--
by
the
witnesses
against
him
which
would
include
if
mr.
sourwine
is
relying
upon
a
piece
of
paper.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
he
didn't
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
didn't
indicate
the
slightest
difficulty
in
getting
it.
they
never
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
wasn't
our
obligation,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
may
i
just
explain
this
right
and
very
clearly
here?
mr.
sourwine
never
at
any
time
suggested
he
could
not
ask
mr.
morris
and
produce
a
letter.
he
said,
“i
will
not,
because
it's
privilege.
it's
confidential.”
he
never
--
there
was
never
in
the
confines
of
that
courtroom
ever
a
suggestion
that
the
letter
was
not
made
available
--
was
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but,
if
your
honor,
may
i
suggest
to
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
don't
suggest
that
mr.
morris
didn't
have
it,
but
when
the
assistant
chief
counsel
comes
and
says,
“it's
confidential,”
never
suggests
that
if
he
asks
mr.
morris
had
given
to
him,
he
wouldn't,
that
there
would
never
in
this
entire
five-year
litigation,
i
would
suggest
that
your
honors
the
first
person
who
has
ever
made
the
slightest
intimation
that
this
document
was
not
available
to
mr.
sourwine
by
the
simplest
request
of
mr.
morris.
but
mr.
sourwine
said,
“this
document
is
confidential
and
i
won't
produce
it.”
this
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
must
respectfully
disagree
that
when
you
are
going
after
the
official
representative,
testifying
at
the
hearing
as
the
agent
of
the
committee,
the
only
person
testifying
who
says
that
--
who
never
claims
his
document
is
not
available
to
him,
who
in
fact
makes
perfectly
clear
that
he
couldn't
produce
it
but
he
says,
“i
won't
because
it's
confidential.”
no
one,
not
even
the
government,
has
ever
suggested
until
--
no
one,
as
i
say,
until
your
honor
raised
this
point,
has
ever
suggested
that
mr.
sourwine
representing
the
committee
was
not
in
a
position
to
produce
a
document
which
another
agent
of
the
committee
had
and
was
available
to
mr.
sourwine
when
he
says,
“i
will
not
give
it
to
you.”
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
now,
the
government
raised
four
points.
they
dropped
the
one
that
court
of
appeals
raised,
they
made
four
where
they
said,
“first,
we
didn't
raised
it”
and
i've
told
you,
(inaudible)
raised
probable
cause,
but
we
didn't
raise
the
fourth
amendment.”
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
fourth,
fifth
and
first
amendment
probable
cause,
we
raised
at
the
trial
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court
on
petition
for
cert
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
right
at
the
very
beginning
on
page
40,
you
will
see
that
he's
already
answering
me
mr.
--
i
may
say
he
used
the
language
of
mr.
rauh
that
--
this
is
mr.
hicks,
at
the
bottom
of
page
40,
the
man
off
the
street
could
be
off
the
street
and
ask,
“are
you
on
one
of
the
persons
against
whom
we
would
do
it.”
“i
had
already
prior
to
that
time
said
that
you
couldn't
call
a
man
off
the
street.”
again,
on
page
37,
i
say,
the
middle
of
page
37,
i'm
quoting
myself,
“i
would
say
that
that
is
both
a
violation
of
fourth
and
fifth
amendments.
it's
an
absence
of
probable
cause.”
now,
the
second
government
argument
is
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
subpoenas
to
testify.
they
say
--
i
must
say
that
this
--
it's
a
little
hard
to
believe
this
sentence,
but
the
government
of
page
44
of
their
brief
says,
“the
requirement
that
a
person
appeared
briefly
before
a
congressional
committee
is
not
subject
to
the
fourth
amendment.”
i
don't
know
what
the
“briefly”
means.
the
requirement
that
you
appear
briefly
at
the
police
station
would
be
under
the
fourth
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
the
requirement
you
appeared
briefly
before
a
congressional
committee
to
have
your
mind
searched
is
certainly
under
the
fourth
amendment.
well,
your
honors
have
settled
this
--
watkins,
barenblatt,
and
wilkinson,
all
contain
statements
that
search
and
seizure
and
probable
cause
apply.
the
government
says,
“that's
only
the
first
amendment,
not
the
fourth.”
but
i
suggest
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yeah,
they
mentioned
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yeah,
they
mentioned
--
they
used
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
didn't
suggest
they
used
the
fourth
amendment.
i
was
very
--
the
watkins
case,
“witnesses
cannot
be
subjected
to
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.”
that's
certainly
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment.
barenblatt
says,
that
this
case
did
not
involve
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures
lacking
in
probable
cause.
now,
search
and
seizure
and
probable
cause
are
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment.
there's
no
other
amendment
that
those
words
refer
to.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
i
say,
i
do
not
think
you
have
probable
cause
or
some
other
phrase,
“i'm
a
victim
of
accident,”
then
they
must
tell
you.
actually,
your
honor,
may
i
put
your
finger
on
--
on
another
ground?
this
is
maybe
the
answer
again.
remember
all
of
this
happened
before
watkins.
everything
here
happened
before
watkins.
it
is
very
likely
that
when
he
said,
“i'm
a
victim
of
accident,
they
had
a
responsibility
to
tell
him,
“no,
we
have
this
letter”
and
as
we're
making
a
footnote
in
our
reply
brief,
it's
very
possible
which
your
honors
don't
have
to
go
any
far
that
--
than
to
say
just
like
your
honor
said,
when
you
raised
pertinency
in
watkins,
they
--
you
have
to
give
him
an
answer,
so
very
likely
when
he
said,
“i'm
a
victim
of
accident.”
they
should
have
give
him
an
answer.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
believe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
i
would
say
in
this
particular
case
where
he
said
i'm
a
victim
of
accident
and
it
was
a
fortiori
ten
times
over.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
now,
in
our
judgment,
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply.
i
mean,
under
our
bill
of
rights,
no
more
can
a
congressional
committee
without
probable
cause
search
a
man's
mind
in
a
(inaudible)
concession's
pockets.
this
is
the
--
the
fourth
amendment
actually
uses
the
word
persons.
it's
the
first
word
in
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
can't
say
that
to
a
constable
but
he
can
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
he
can
quash
everything
that
happened
as
a
result
of
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
will
try
not
to
be
sworn,
if
your
honor
please.
he
fought
--
mr.
shelton
fought
this
all
the
way
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
but
without
probable
cause.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely,
your
honor.
[laughter]
that's
exactly
what
i'm
trying
to
do.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
i'd
also
--
what
occurred
to
me
that
on
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
the
court
said
nothing
except
that
no
man
in
this
land
can
be
called
before
a
congressional
committee
without
probable
cause.
i
have
so
read
pages
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
would
say,
for
example,
that
boyd
and
brimson,
both
of
which
are
subpoenas
duces
tecum
are
no
different
insofar
as
the
--
as
the
principle
is
concerned,
there's
no
difference
between
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
and
the
subpoena
to
testify,
and
you
have
many
times
held
that
a
man
cannot
be
called
before
a
congressional
committee
with
documents
without
probable
cause
and
so
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
same
rule
with
subpoena
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
now,
the
government
doesn't
deny
that
the
first
amendment
applies.
the
government
doesn't
deny
that
the
first
amendment
applies
and
there
must
be
a
likelihood
even
the
government
doesn't
claim
--
making
--
you
can
just
call
these
people.
they
say
there
must
be
a
likelihood.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
they
say
the
first
amendment.
they
say
it
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
they
said
that
nobody
can
be
called
without
likelihood.
they
concede
that
much.
i
don't
know
what
you
do
when
you
start
with
the
word
likelihood
and
either
way
probable
cause
because
as
you
run
away
from
likelihood,
what
likelihood
mean?
pretty
soon,
you're
at
possibility
and
not
probability;
nevertheless,
the
government
says
it's
all
a
matter
of
likelihood.
well,
in
our
judgment,
the
fourth
amendment
applies
as
well
as
the
first.
well,
i
want
to
close
this
today's
session
on
this
note.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record,
nothing
in
this
record
that
shows
either
probable
cause
or
likelihood,
that
is
the
real
--
that
is
the
ground
on
which
there
must
be
an
acquittal.
there
is
not
--
assuming
the
government
is
right
that
it's
only
likelihood,
assuming
i'm
wrong
that
it
has
to
be
probable
cause
under
the
fourth
amendment,
there's
nothing
to
show
likelihood,
because
the
only
thing
on
which
they
predicate
likelihood
of
information
is
a
letter
that
was
withheld.
in
other
words,
the
government
couldn't
quite
say
we're
relying
on
this
letter.
they
used
the
letter
five
times
in
their
brief
but
they
never
explained
how
they
can
rely
on
it
when
it
was
withheld.
they
admit
they
have
to
prove
likelihood.
they
don't
just
show
any
ground
in
which
they
can
rely
on
the
letter.
they
admit
there
is
nothing
else.
so
you
know
what
they
finally
come
up
with?
they've
come
up
with
the
argument
that
it's
unreviewable.
they
have
come
up
now
finally,
if
your
honors
will
look
on
pages
59
and
60
of
the
government's
brief,
their
final
argument
is
this
court
has
no
grounds
on
which
to
review.
you
cannot
review
whether
there
was
a
likelihood
and
i
would
just
like
to
read
this
sentence
from
the
concurring
opinion
in
watkins
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
which
seems
to
me
that
answer
the
government's
unreviewability
argument
better
than
any
way
i
could
put
it.
“by
making
the
federal
judiciary,
the
affirmative
agency
for
enforcing
the
authority
that
underlies
the
congressional
power
to
punish
for
contempt,
congress
necessarily
brings
into
play
the
specific
provisions
of
the
constitution
relating
to
the
prosecution
of
our
offenses
and
those
implied
restrictions
under
which
the
court
functions.”
now,
if
your
honors
please,
the
government
has
admitted,
they
have
to
have
a
likelihood
of
information
from
this
witness
in
order
to
call
it.
we
said
it's
probable
cause
but
they
admit
likelihood.
the
only
likelihood
is
a
document
that's
been
withheld
wrongfully
under
the
confrontation
part
of
the
sixth
amendment.
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
--
well,
its
processes
will
not
be
used
to
punish
people
criminally
unless
the
sixth
amendment,
unless
the
processes
of
the
court
can
be
upheld.
therefore,
even
on
the
government's
theory
of
likelihood,
there
is
no
possible
way
in
which
this
conviction
can
be
sustained
because
it
just
so
many
words,
the
government
in
five
years
of
litigation
has
never
told
us
how
they
could
use
this
letter.
i
hope
tomorrow,
we
will
find
out
at
long
last
what
the
government's
theory
is.
they've
thrown
away
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
namely,
that
you
could
anybody
out
in
the
newspapers.
they
have
said
--
they
have
relied
on
a
letter
that
we
weren't
shown
under
circumstances
where
it's
quite
obvious.
we
made
a
prime
facie
case
of
incredibility
even
though
we
didn't
have
to,
and
now
they
say
to
us
at
a
final
matter,
this
is
unreviewable.
your
honors
cannot
question
whether
there
was
the
likelihood.
in
other
words,
the
government's
position
in
this
court
is
really
back
to
where
i
was
in
the
district
court
when
the
prosecutor
said
we
can
call
the
man
off
the
street.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
we
submit
on
the
brief
the
issue
of
the
question
under
inquiry
which
we
have
fully
briefed.
on
the
question
of
the
indictment,
it
does
not
contain
the
question
under
inquiry
that
the
grand
jury
was
wrong
and
chosen.
we
rely
upon
petitioner
in
the
next
case,
it
will
be
heard
in
one
when
we
finish.
now,
coming
to
the
problem
of
probable
cause
in
this
--
in
this
case,
i
know
it's
an
academic
question
that
the
court
seems
to
very
interested
in
is
whether
one
has
to
raise
probable
cause
before
the
committee.
however,
the
question
is
not
before
this
court
because
we
raised
probable
cause,
i
challenge
anybody
to
find
better
words
and
i
failed
to
see
why
i
am
involved
in
this
hearing
and
to
find
better
words
and
i
am
a
victim
of
accident
short
of
reciting
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
i
do
not
think
is
called
for
by
layman
thing
and
so
the
question
was
raised.
now
the
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
asked,
"did
we
raise
the
problem
and
have
we
--
did
i
argue?"
that
at
the
time
he
says,
"i
am
a
victim
of
accident."
does
the
committee
have
an
obligation
to
respond,
"you
are
not
a
victim
of
accident,
we
have
a
letter
here
that
says
it
from
a
reliable
informant,"
and
we've
argue
this
fully
in
footnote
6
on
page
13
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
on
page
89
--
87
--
89
sir.
on
the
second
--
the
first
sentence
in
the
second
full
paragraph,
"i
am
involved
in
these
hearings
as
a
victim
of
accident."
now,
therefore
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'm
only
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
we
raised
the
point.
we
are
not
at
this
moment
arguing
the
validity
of
the
point.
i
am
suggesting
we
raised
it.
that
is
the
only
point
i
have
made
so
far.
now,
coming
to
what
is
based,
we
did
raise
it.
now,
whether
we
would
have
to,
i
agree
with
the
questions
that
we
wouldn't
have
had
to,
but
the
fact
is
we
did
so
i
don't
quite
see
how
it
will
serve
my
short
remaining
time
to
argue
that
we
didn't
have
to
when
in
fact
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
we
did
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
see
no
more
reason
why
i
feel
that
it's
the
same
as
watkins.
we're
entitled
to
be
told
so
we
know
whether
we
have
to
answer,
and
it
is
not
true
that
this
man
had
a
closed
mind
in
whether
he'd
answer
these
questions.
right
in
the
record,
he
told
that
i
was
permitted
to
tell
the
judge
that
if
he
were
ever
legally
required
to
answer
these
questions,
he
would
do
so.
in
other
words,
this
is
not
a
man
who
went
in
there
with
a
blank
mind
that
he
would
never
consider
answering
the
questions,
this
is
a
man
as
to
whom
he
might
very
well
know.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
raise
it
both
ways,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
think
that
any
facts
that
the
committee
has
would
help
a
man
resolve
whether
he
has
a
right
not
to
answer,
should
be
provided
for.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
no
facts
in
your
statement.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
now
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
might
be
enough,
your
honor.
i
don't
say
that
it
is
and
i'm
glad
that
question
isn't
here
because
he
didn't
say
anything.
it
might
--
that
would
be
a
border
line
case,
i
would,
if
i
had
that
case,
i
would
be
(inaudible)
but
i
recognized
it's
a
different
case
than
this.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
was
just
coming
to
the
trial,
if
your
honor
please.
now,
so
much
for
the
hearing,
we
say
victim
of
accident,
i
failed
to
see
why
i'm
here,
raises
at
least
first,
we
think
for
forth,
we
think
there
should
have
been
an
answer.
now,
let's
forget
about
it
--
let's
begin
with
the
trial.
there's
no
question
we
raised
first,
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
of
the
trial
if
they
hadn't
have
a
--
a
reasonable
ground
for
calling
it.
raised
it
--
it's
--
it
was
the
whole
trial.
the
re
--
record
is
reached
of
this
--
this
point.
now,
the
government
takes
this
position.
they
say,
they
have
admitted
now
that
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
the
witness
has
information
which
it
is
--
which
has
a
value
to
the
committee.
they've
--
this
is
then
to
quote
again
from
mr.
terris,
"that
the
witness
--
that
they
have
to
present
a
basis
for
calling
him
at
the
trial."
now
they
say
they
have
a
basis
for
calling
him
at
the
trial
because
the
witness
(inaudible)
comes
in
and
says,
"there
is
a
letter."
we
make
a
prima
facie
case
that
there
is
not
a
letter
and
you
didn't
hear
one
word
out
of
mr.
terris
suggesting
that
the
prima
facie
case
we
made
that
the
wit
--
that
there
is
no
letter,
was
in
anyway
--
that
he
had
any
rebuttal
to
the
prima
facie
case
i
made
yesterday
that
there
was
no
letter
that
the
witness
contradict
himself
--
why
willard
shelton
if
there
was
the
letter,
why
was
he
surprised,
why
did
he
say
the
witness
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
i'm
saying
that
i
made
a
pro
--
on
cross-examination
a
prima
facie
case
that
the
witness
was
not
telling
the
truth
--
that's
all
i
was
adverting
myself
there.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
that's
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
exact
--
you
put
your
finger
on
what
--
on
the
whole
case
here,
the
judge
did
not
find
that
this
letter
existed.
in
other
words,
and
this
is
the
whole
case
and
it
seems
to
me
it
--
it
ends
any
suggestion
that
this
court
could
rely
on
the
letter.
this
court
cannot
rely
on
a
letter
that
the
--
a
judge
refused
to
find
existed.
that's
why
the
judge
found,
you
didn't
need
probable
cause
but
if
you
did,
you
had
it
because
he
was
a
man
of
the
times.
the
judge
refused
to
find
this
letter
existed
and
it
was
--
that
was
the
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
found,
that
you
could
call
anybody
off
the
working
press.
in
other
words
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
this
is
not
a
jury
case.
the
judge
is
the
trier
of
the
fact.
now,
and
it
so
--
that
there's
no
way
the
government
has
conceded
this
case
out
the
window
when
they
say
there
has
to
be
a
showing,
there
is
no
letter
on
this
record
because
the
trial
judge
refused
to
find
that
there
was
a
letter.
now
if
i
may
address
myself
to
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
sir
from
yesterday
about
the
draper
case.
the
draper
case
was
a
case
where
a
paid
informant,
narcotics
informant
--
you
know
it
better
than
i
do
but
i
was
really
describing
it
to
the
other
side
of
the
draper.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
let's
take
the
draper
case
which
was
the
first
when
you
imagine.
there
was
a
paid
informant,
told
a
federal
narcotics
agent
about
a
man
and
would
--
it
would've
been
probable
cause
if
the
informant
had
been
there,
but
the
agent
got
it
hearsay
from
the
informant.
they
arrested
the
man
in
the
quest
--
the
agent
then
died
so
the
(voice
overlap)
--
no,
the
informant
died.
so
the
agent
testified
probable
cause
and
this
court
allowed
it.
the
difference
between
this
and
the
draper
case
is
that
there,
the
hear
--
it
was
admitted
that
the
hearsay
existed.
here,
we
deny
that
the
hearsay
exists.
we
deny
that
the
letter
exists.
in
other
words,
our
case
would
be
like
draper
if
we
have
gotten
the
letter
and
then
said
this
letter
is
not
sufficient.
we're
sa
--
we're
saying
the
letter
doesn't
exist.
there
isn't
any
letter,
there's
no
proof
the
judge
--
district
judge
wouldn't
find
there
was
a
letter.
the
government
wouldn't
produce
it,
so
that
in
other
words,
in
draper,
the
fact
of
that
hearsay
existed
was
not
contested.
we
are
saying
there
is
no
evidence
hearsay
or
otherwise.
so
in
our
judgment,
i
didn't
really
give
a
--
adequate
distinction
of
draper
yesterday
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
completely
distinguishable
on
the
ground
that
there,
the
hearsay
obviously
existed
the
testimony
and
here,
we're
saying
there
is
no
letter,
the
hearsay
doesn't
exist.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
also
like
if
justice
frankfurter
would
do
me
the
--
a
favor
of
looking
at
the
record
page
99
where
yesterday,
he
referred
to
the
fact
at
the
bottom.
i
think
it
is
locked
in
the
safe
of
the
present
chief
counsel,
mr.
robert
morris
and
suggested
that
this
raised
a
problem
for
the
defense.
i
would
ask
only
that
we
go
to
the
next
question
and
the
next
answer
mr.
justice.
isn't
that
in
the
files
of
the
internal
security
committee?
answer,
"i
think
it
is
in
the
archives
of
the
committee,
it
is
in
the
possession
of
the
committee."
in
other
words,
the
government
is
conceding
there
that
they
--
that
that
this
is
the
witness
(inaudible)
saying
we
have
possession
of
it,
but
as
he
says
on
page
117
of
the
record
(voice
overlap)
117
when
i
asked
for
the
production
of
the
letter
to
the
court.
on
page
18
--
118
turning
over,
i
asked
the
court
for
it
but
mr.
justice
(inaudible)
saying
"i
am
sorry
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
rauh."
well
i
used
that
advice
of
you
sir.
“i
am
sorry
mr.
rauh
i
can't
give
you
that
letter."
it
is
confidential
but
then
he
doesn't
tell
us
why
and
that
--
but
i
kept
on
and
in
six
places
in
the
record,
i
would
like
to
give
you
these
citations
if
i
may.
six
times
in
the
record,
i
asked
his
honor
of
the
court,
to
give
us
this
document.
r99,
117,
169,
173,
181,
210
and
only
the
court
could
order
it
given
to
us
because
under
the
rules
of
the
senate,
neither
(inaudible)
or
morris
nor
anybody
else
could
give
it
to
us
without
an
order
of
the
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
can
--
he
can
get
that
your
honor
because
if
he
refuses
that
--
and
that's
the
difference
between
that
proceeding
and
this.
if
i
go
before
a
grand
jury
and
that
they
won't
tell
me
if
why
they
have
asked
me
to
come
there.
when
i
refused
to
answer,
i'm
not
in
contempt.
i
don't
--
not
going
to
be
indicted.
i
am
taken
before
the
court
and
at
this
time,
i
say,
that
they
didn't
have
any
grounds
for
calling
me.
the
court
will
ask
them,
"at
that
stage
and
before
any
criminal
offense
is
committed,"
the
court
will
then
say,
"what
the
--
we'll
ask
the
district
attorney
why
--
why
do
you
want
this
man?"
what
is
the
probable
cause
and
the
court
will
decide.
you
get
a
--
if
the
man
goes
back
and
refuses
to
answer.
actually,
he
can
appeal
that
right
out.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
happens
everyday,
if
your
honor
please.
when
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
by
a
man
refu
--
by
a
man
refusing
to
answer,
you
can't
go
and
get
an
injunction.
this
was
the
point,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
does
it.
i
mean
you
can't
get
an
injunction
against
the
grand
jury,
but
if
you
refused
to
answer
before
you
are
put
where
you
determine
whether
you're
going
to
commit
the
crime
of
refusing
to
answer,
you
do
get
it
from
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
hale
and
henkel
actually
does
say
there
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
have
two
points,
that's
one
of
them.
secondly,
that
certainly
at
the
trial,
the
government
has
to
make
some
showing
and
the
government
--
i
want
to
make
clear
that
the
government
has
conceded
this
case.
justice
frankfurter
finally
takes
a
--
took
a
position
in
his
questions,
stronger
than
the
government.
the
government
has
conceded
in
this
court
that
there
must
be
a
showing.
they
simply
say
they
can
make
that
showing
without
the
normal
standards
of
evidence
and
rely
on
the
letter
and
i
say
that
they
can't
do
it
under
the
sixth
amendment
confrontation.
but
even
if
you
can
do
it
under
sixth
amendment
confrontation,
i
say
where
they
fell
down
was
when
he's
--
when
they
indicated
that
there
was
something
in
this
record
that
showed
this
letter
and
i
say
the
one
that
judge
wouldn't
find
this
letter,
they're
out
even
if
you
could
get
around
sixth
amendment
which
you
cannot.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
would
only
say
that
at
one
stage,
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
may
be
i
tried
to
--
to
define
that
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
that
--
i'm
not
certain
how
it
would
work
out
and
say
a
witness
in
a
civil
case
except
again
to
point
out
that
if
the
witness
refuses
to
answer,
there
would
--
the
judge
will
have
to
determine
relevance
and
there
will
be
no
requirement
on
this
witness
to
answer
until
the
judge
and
through
the
entire
appellant
procedure,
has
determined
the
relevance
of
the
question.
in
other
words,
the
pro
--
the
--
you
--
you
do
not
get
the
situation
where
a
man
can
be
called
with
no
reasonable
grounds,
you
don't
get
that
in
a
civil
case
because
the
judge
will
determine
that
the
--
that
there
were
by
virtue
of
the
action
on
the
particular
question.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
make
that
suggestion,
i
was
making
it
much
more
limited
suggestion.
the
witness
there
has
the
protection
of
the
judge's
decision
on
relevance
before
he
is
required
to
answer
which
protection
he
does
not
have
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
difference
here
is
--
well,
i
suppose,
one
difference
is,
it's
the
government
of
the
united
states
operating
to
force
a
answer
in
a
first
amendment
ground
as
against
a
civil
action
which
ordinarily,
is
not
going
to
raise
a
problem.
people
aren't
--
individuals
are
not
ordinarily
calling
people
to
testify
unless
they
themselves
have
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
they
would
have
a
better
--
there's
a
difference
between
the
government's
operation
here
which
is
the
congressional
committee
and
the
individual
whose
right,
you
have
to
protect.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
your
honor,
i
believe
it
in
terms
of
--
and
the
government
agrees.
you
see,
we
had
a
wonderful
morning
here.
we've
had
a
--
a
meeting
of
the
minds.
the
government
and
the
--
mr.
shelton's
counsel
agree,
"that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
the
witness
has
information
which
is
of
value
to
the
committee."
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
i
--
i
was
suggesting
that
it
hadn't
bound
the
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
i
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
i
simply
said,
we
have
had
a
remarkable
unanimity
up
here
on
--
and
the
government
has
conceded
the
case
because
they
have
therefore
said,
"we
have
a
right
to
the
letter,"
but
they
--
there
is
no
letter
because
the
district
judge
wouldn't
find
the
letter
and
that
is
perfectly
clear.
and
i
would
like
to
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
tried
your
honor
--
we
--
we
issued
this
subpoena
to
the
committee
that's
referred
to
on
page
26
of
our
brief
of
our
record.
the
first
point
we
issued
a
subpoena
for
all
documents
relevant
to
this.
this
was
denied
and
you
--
and
on
the
ground
that
we
weren't
entitled
to
it
because
probable
cause
wasn't
an
issue
and
you
couldn't
have
issued
any
further
subpoena
because
this
--
i
mean
this
--
if
we
issued
another
subpoena
after
the
judge
had
denied
that
one.
i
think
i
might
have
been
in
contempt
in
case.
if
you
look
at
this
record
pretty
carefully,
there
were
a
couple
of
times
when
i
think
that
the
judge
felt
i
was
pressing
his
letter
pretty
hard.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely,
your
honor,
and
only
after
a
jud
--
court
order.
in
other
words,
what
would've
happened
was,
if
the
court
had
ordered
the
production
of
this
letter,
then
the
--
then
the
senate
would
--
would
have
automatically,
there's
a
procedure
whereby
when
the
court
orders
a
reduction
of
a
--
of
a
document
then
the
senate
and
the
house
do
provide
it,
but
the
initial
step
is
the
court's
ruling
that
the
document
is
a
material.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely,
and
i
kept
saying
when
they
subpoenaed
this
out,
your
honor,
then
of
course
we
are
entitled
to
an
acquittal
because
the
case
is
not
proved
and
this
seemed
to
be
rec
--
recognized
if
any
form
of
cause
were
necessary
as
is
i
would
point
out
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'm
glad
that
we
could
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
i'm
glad
we
could
end
on
such
a
nice
note
of
agreement,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'll
make
the
following
distinctions.
first,
this
is
a
subpoena
--
this
is
a
subpoena
by
the
united
states
of
america
through
its
congress.
the
other
is
essentially
an
individual
action.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
have
three,
your
honor.
i
have
been
trying
to
write
out
as
you
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
you
spoke
so
if
i
didn't
look
attentive,
but
i
was
trying
to
prepare
my
answer.
first,
there
may
be
others,
i
would
say
that
this
governmental
action
subject
to
due
process
and
it
is
arbitrary
for
a
congressional
committee
to
summon
someone
without
any
cause
and
that
is
this
record.
secondly,
there
is
in
the
court
a
proceeding
for
protection
which
i
tried
to
make
in
my
answer
to
--
before
that
the
mere
mechanics
of
how
it
works
is
a
protection
in
the
court
room
that
it
is
not
here.
but
if
the
man
walks
here
and
say,
"i
don't
know
that
i'm
a
victim
of
accident."
the
judge
is
going
to
make
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
in
a
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
obviously,
he
would
--
he
would
say
to
the
judge,
"i
am
a
victim
of
accident,
i
--
i
was
--
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
anything,
they
must
have
had
a
mistake
--
mistaken
identity
which
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
then
the
judge
would
ask
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no.
the
judge
would
immediately
ask
the
prosecutor
--
ask
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
ask
the
parties
what
the
relevance
of
these
all
is
and
--
and
if
relevance
were
shown,
the
judge
would
finally
decide
it
one
way
or
another.
this
fellow
would
at
least
have
had
the
protection
in
there
of
a
judicial
decision
before
answering.
so
i
say
there
--
there's
a
difference
in
the
type
of
action
here
and
there's
a
difference
in
the
practical
application
of
the
action.
and
thirdly,
and
i
--
i
don't
know
which
is
the
most
important
of
the
three
and
i
noticed
that
the
light
is
on
and
i
was
going
to
end
on
--
on
this.
this
is
an
action
in
an
area
of
the
first
amendment.
there
can
be
--
even
assuming,
everything
this
court
has
said,
if
your
honor
please,
assuming
--
assuming
exactly
what
the
--
i
accept
--
i
mean
i
don't
accept
the
decisions
of
barenblatt
and
wilkins
and
in
braden,
do
not
--
they
base
it
on
a
relative
consideration
of
need.
there
can
be
no
need
for
the
testimony
of
a
victim
of
accident
and
particularly
in
this
area,
the
procedural
requirement
and
this
is
all
--
this
is
(inaudible)
in
all
of
your
cases
where
procedural
requirements
definiteness
and
certainty,
must
apply
doubly
so
in
this
area.
so
that
where
--
i
think
when
the
government
concedes
that
there
is
some
cause,
they
are
recognized
and
i
think
it
was
on
a
first
amendment
time
when
they
were
concede
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
the
witness
has
information,
they
recognized
the
same
distinction
that
in
essence
--
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
make
that
in
this
area
where
the
first
amendment
is
in
--
is
involved,
there
must
be
some
showing
as
--
as
part
of
that
and
this
is,
i
would
say,
a
part
from
probable
cause
under
the
fourth
amendment
which
possibly
this
court
will
not
have
to
reach
since
there
isn't
any
cause
at
all,
since
there
isn't
any
letter
under
any
amendments.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
may
be
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
i
would
say
that
they
may.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
wouldn't
say
and
i
think
your
honor
will
be
--
would
recognize
this
particularly
that
there
are
degrees
of
protection
--
there
is
a
dispute
on
this
and
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
be
very
close
and
disputed
decisions
of
this
court
as
indicating
relative
considerations
in
here.
i
read
the
minority
is
indicating
that
there
are
not
relative
considerations.
i
read
the
majority
as
indicating
that
there
are
relative
considerations
of
freedom
of
speech
and
protection
in
this
area.
i
say
here
where
you're
being
called
before
one
of
these
two
committees
as
the
chief
justice
suggested.
we're
being
called
before
the
one
that's
in
the
house
in
america
and
other
is
one
here,
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee.
were
you
being
called
here?
this
is
peculiarly
vulnerable
and
dangerous.
now,
principles
have
to
be
established
for
committees
but
--
and
i
suggest
there
will
have
to
be
some
reasonable
basis
for
all
of
them,
but
we've
reached
the
agreement
and
that
cannot
be
decided
in
this
case
but
there
is
a
concession,
there
is,
it
seems
to
me
an
assumption
that
where
there
is
a
first
amendment
consideration,
and
let
me
say
this
sir,
even
though
this
court
has
decided
five
to
four
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
prevent
the
question
put,
i
don't
think
even
the
majority
suggest
that
this
is
a
frivolous
contention
that
the
four
--
that
that
the
fact
that
this
question
should
never
have
been
asked
anyway,
is
a
frivolous
contention.
but
i
say,
when
you
pyramid
upon
that,
asking
a
person
as
to
whom
there
was
no
ground
for
even
calling
him
there,
then
it
seems
to
me,
there
can
be
no
question
in
that
circumstances
that
the
weight
which
your
honors
define
majority
put
in
favor
of
asking
the
question,
clearly
must
go
the
other
way
against
asking.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
of
course,
your
honor,
i
--
i
agree
and
i
would
say,
finally
it
was
--
we
have
discussed
the
fourth
and
the
first
amendment
above
all,
and
i
don't'
see
what
this
seems
to
me,
what
can
settle
this
to
due
process
requirement.
and
if
there
is
anything
i
might
suggest
that
would
be
arbitrary
in
america
today
when
the
risk
that
comes
was
going
before
these
committees
and
i've
been
before
them.
there's
anything
that
would
be
arbitrary,
it
would
requiring
a
man
to
come
and
have
his
name
in
the
area
of
communism
without
some
reason
maybe
as
much
as
i
say
probability,
maybe
as
much
as
the
government
says
reasonable.
but
if
there
would
be
anything
that
would
be
arbitrary,
i'd
say
it
was
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
am
not
here
to
rectify
the
wrongs
of
history.
i'm
here
to
present
a
case
of
a
particular
human
being
who
has
obviously,
on
this
record
been
wrong.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
my
claim
is
based
upon
the
concurring
opinion
in
watkins
which
reads
as
follows,
"by
making
the
federal
judiciary,
the
affirmative
agency
for
enforcing
the
authority
that
underlies
the
congressional
power
to
punish
for
contempt,
congress
necessarily
brings
into
play
the
specific
provisions
of
the
constitution
relating
to
the
prosecution
of
offenses
and
those
implied
restrictions
under
which
a
court
functions."
i
could
not
have
said
it
better
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
principles,
if
i
may
submit
in
which
i
have
principles
applied
generally
sir.
