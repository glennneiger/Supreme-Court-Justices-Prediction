justice
john
m.
harlan
on
what
ground?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
the
fifth?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
assuming
in
your
probable
cause
argument
that
this
is
a
legitimate
congressional
inquiry,
in
other
words,
an
inquiry
in
aid
of
a
legislative
purpose.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
premise
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
which
you
started
for
your
probable
cause
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
you're
not
arguing
that
probable
cause
was
in
fact
--
or
in
determining
whether
this
is
exposure
for
exposure's
sake
and
whatnot.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
news
to
me,
i
was
just
wondering
where
did
you
find
the
fourth
amendment
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
sentence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
he
make
a
pertinency
objection
before?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
take
issue
with
mr.
van
arkel
statement
would
be
made
an
adequate
objection
on
the
pertinency?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
trying
to
raise
the
questions
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
he
did?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
means
to
your
witness?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
does
that
qualify
that
the
theory
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
rauh
very
frankly
stated
yesterday.
i
assume
your
argument
is
the
same.
this
probable
cause
argument
was
out
of
premise
(inaudible)
within
the
compounds
of
this
--
(inaudible)
pursuance
of
the
legitimate
congressional
purpose.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
framework
in
which
this
whole
probable
cause
issue
is
being
--
well,
we
are
not
dealing
with
probable
cause
in
terms
of
whether
in
some
evidence,
the
committee
was
(inaudible)
suppose
your
expedition.
we're
dealing
with
what
is
recognized
by
your
opponent
as
being
a
legitimate
congressional
concern.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
subpoena
issue,
pursuance
of
a
legitimate
congressional
concern.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
a
contention
being
made
by
your
adversary
that
(inaudible)
that
they
don't
rely
on
the
jenks
case,
do
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
your
victim
of
accident
stated?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
--
could
i
ask
you
a
question,
is
the
doctrine
that
you're
advocating
here
is
something
that's
peculiar
to
the
congressional
committees
or
would
it
apply
to
a
judicial
subpoena
or
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
be
concrete.
if
one
of
the
subpoenas
that
aid
subpoenas
before
a
grand
jury
has
to
go
into
the
grand
jury
room
and
they
can
go
into
the
court
and
say,
i
want
to
know
by
the
district
attorney
who's
subpoenaing
me
before
i
should
be
required
to
testify?
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
(voice
overlap)
--
question
on
how
you
raise
it
but
you
--
you
--
you
think
that
in
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
a
man
can
go
before
the
court
and
say,
"before
i
can
be
asked
any
question,
i
want
to
know
what
--
what
the
ground
is
in
which
i
was
subpoenaed."
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
never
heard
of
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
question
is
if
what
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
is
put
to
you
first
that
your
proposition
would
be,
i
take
it
that
however
relevant
the
questions
may
be
that
before
any
questions
are
put
to
the
witness
at
all,
he
has
a
preliminary
objection
that
would
go
to
a
disclosure
of
the
grounds
on
which
he
was
being
asked
to
testify.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
agreement
doesn't
bind
this
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
discretion
(inaudible)
you
keep
talking
all
about
the
--
always
about
the
first
amendment
area.
there's
another
constitutional
(inaudible)
and
there's
a
right
of
congress
to
legislate,
won't
you
agree
with
that
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
and,
the
grand
jury
in
--
perhaps
in
moreland
act
commissioner
in
new
york.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
the
government's
position,
really?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
understand
the
government
to
come
anywhere
near
your
approach
on
this
probable
cause
issue.
all
they
say
is
that,
certainly,
when
it
comes
to
assessing
the
ger
--
the
--
assessing
the
character
of
this
investigation
as
one
for
exposure
or
exposure's
sake
or
as
one
being
pursuant
to
a
legislative
obj
--
proper
legislative
objective,
then
the
question
as
to
whether
there
is
held
a
scale
or
hauling
of
people
in
off
the
streets
of
what
might
be
a
germane
consideration.
but,
i
understand
you
and
the
other
people
here
are
arguing
these
cases
on
the
premise
that
this
investigation,
at
least
accepting
the
decisions
of
this
court,
is
in
pursuance
of
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose.
and,
your
argument
on
probable
cause
is
within
the
framework
of
it
being
a
legitimate
investigation,
am
i
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
there's
no
legitimate
investigation
here
because
you
don't
accept
the
barenblatt
case.
that's
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
start
from
that
premise,
are
you
contending
that
this
is
not
a
legitimate
investigation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
what's
the
effect
about
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
barenblatt
doesn't
govern
that
either?
justice
john
m.
harlan
education
is
alright,
but
not
press.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
was
a
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
an
application
after
the
grand
jury
found
it
was
voir
dire?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand.
my
question
was
before
the
matter
reaches
the
grand
jury,
was
there
an
application
in
the
(inaudible)
with
respect
to
the
jurors?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
on
1857?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
were
in
the
wire?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
he
have
a
prepared
statement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
about
pertinency?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
right
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
there
was
no
fifth
amendment
claim
interposed
at
any
stage
of
this
proceeding?
