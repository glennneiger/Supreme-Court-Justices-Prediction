(voice

chief

mr.
maroney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suggest
mr.
maroney
that
you
don't
force
us
to
--
to
read
two
or
three
or
more
sets
of
briefs
in
order
to
know
what
your
issues
are
in
the
--
in
the
case.
i
think
if
you
--
if
you
at
least
give
us
a
--
fair
citations
of
your
--
of
your
point
on
the
brief
that
would
be
adequate
and
if
you
want
to
refer
us
further
to
other
briefs,
but
don't
--
don't
leave
us
in
a
point
where
we
position
--
where
we
read
this
brief
and
we
can't
--
can't
get
your
case
from
it
unless
we
--
we
go
back
to
some
other
case
that
--
that
isn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
consistent
with
our
rules,
i
think.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
asked
you
--
justice
black
asked
you
if
this
case
was
cited
in
your
brief
--
in
this
brief
and
you
said,
“no,
it
was
cited
in
the
shelton
brief,”
but
if
you
rely
on
it
this
case,
why
isn't
cited
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
grand
jurors
that
are
complained
off
here
were
relatives
of
members
of
the
committee,
would
you
have
to
--
would
you
have
to
prove
those
actual
bias
in
their
minds
from
something
they
had
said
or
done
before
the
validity
of
the
indictment
that
they
challenged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
i
said
if
these
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
realize
that
that
would
be
an
actual
--
actual
bias,
but
suppose
their
employees
of
the
congress?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
they
--
would
you
have
to
show
them
that
they
were
--
they
had
actual
bias
if
it
--
if
it
was
demonstrated
that
they
were
employees
of
the
congress?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
the
relationship
to
the
prosecution,
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
relevant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
they
were
not
employees
of
the
congress,
but
were
employees
of
some
department
that
was
under
programs
that
were
initiated
by
and
investigated
by
and
--
and
supervised
by
congress.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
i
--
that
was
i
was
getting
at.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
were
those
grand
juries
or
trial
juries?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
you
can
have
--
there
you
can
have
a
voir
dire
and
you
can
--
you
can
test
a
man's
mind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
find
out
what
he's
got
in
his
mind,
but
here
you
cannot
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
maroney,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question
on
that
--
on
--
on
that
bias.
assume,
let's
just
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
these
15
jurors
who
work
for
the
government
were
frightened
then
would
be
--
would
be
afraid
of
their
jobs.
for
instance
if
they
fail
to
indict
at
first
in
this
--
in
this
area,
let's
just
assume
that
they
were,
how
could
a
man
under
your
theory
ever
attack
that
and
ever
get
it
--
ever
get
it
grand
jury
that
would
not
be
composed
of
people
who
were
guided
by
those
fears?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
wouldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
you
wouldn't
let
him
have
a
hearing
to
determine
--
to
determine
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
here
--
i
suppose
here
their
showing
was
that
--
that
these
men
do
work
for
the
government,
that
there
are
these
loyalty
programs,
that
there
are
certain
practices
that
--
that
government
employees
are
discharged
at
times
on
--
on
confidential
information
that
is
not
available
to
them
and
that
they
have
no
way
of
defending
themselves
on
their
jobs.
and
--
and
so
therefore,
they
say
these
people
by
--
by
operation
of
law
are
biased
and
they
want
to
show
--
they
want
to
show
through
--
through
hearing
where
they
would
examine
the
jurors
that
fear
does
possess
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
else
could
they
do,
would
they
have
--
would
the
man
have
to
say
--
would
i
tell
somebody
in
the
defense
that
i'm
afraid
and
that's
the
reason
i
indicted
your
--
voted
to
indict
your
client?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
but
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
there
is
nothing
--
there
is
nothing
open
to
him
to
defend
on
in
your
--
in
your
view,
if
--
if
he
actually
refused
to
answer
the
questions,
that's
--
that's
all
you
concede
that
he
has
a
right
to
show
at
the
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
only
elements
of
the
crime
were
--
where
that
he
failed
to
answer
the
questions
and
it
seems
to
me
that
its
--
there's
no
one
he
can
cross-examine
on
the
subject
and
if
the
--
if
the
grand
jury
was
biased
against
him,
he's
--
he's
guilty
when
he
--
when
--
when
he
goes
into
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
this
kind
of
a
case,
it's
different
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
--
case
is
different
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
felony
case
or
a
--
or
a
murder
case,
but
here
what
is
open
to
him
other
than
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
the
man
who's
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
but
what
--
what's
--
according
to
your
theory
he's
not
--
he's
not
able
to
prove
anything.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fanelli.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
state
your
other
--
other
quite
quickly
briefly
because
i
wanted
to
hear
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
that
appendix
contained?
we
don't
have
it
here.
we
only
have
the
cases
distributed
that
are
for
this
week.
what
are
some
point
are
you're
making
in
connection
with
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no.
i
don't
mean
that.
you're
talking
about
the
appendix
(voice
overlap)
some
other
case
and
we
don't
have
that
distributed.
what
--
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
argue
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
mean
that
you're
not
going
to
take
up
all
the
issues
that
are
in
this
case
here?
you're
going
to
leave
us
down
to
the
sixth
case
before
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
tell
us
what
the
issues
are
in
this
case
that's
in
our
procedure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
to
those
cases
here
today,
we
will
hear
the
arguments
on
all
the
issues
and
not
--
and
not
leave
some
of
them
to
subsequent
cases.
that's
a
procedure
we
must
follow.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
does
have
some
information,
does
he
not
in
subpoena
duces
tecum,
but
if
you
just
pull
him
off
of
the
street
or
pull
him
out
of
his
--
out
of
his
chair
in
his
newspaper
office
and
take
him
to
the
--
take
him
to
the
committee,
he
doesn't
have
any
information.
does
every
--
does
every
witness
who
subpoenaed
without
knowledge
of
what
--
what
he's
going
to
be
up
against
in
the
committee
have
to
--
have
to
bring
a
lawyer
or
forfeit
every
right
to
contest
any
--
any
invasion
of
his
constitutional
rights
before
the
committee?
is
that
--
did
you
go
that
far?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
witness
does
know
when
he
goes
into
a
judicial
proceeding
that
there
is
either
--
that
there's
indictment
on
file
that
the
person
who
is
charged
with
certain
crime,
what
the
crime
is
and
he
knows
that
he
is
being
--
being
called
by
the
prosecution
or
the
defense
with
relation
to
that
--
to
that
crime,
does
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
nothing
more.
it
can't
go
beyond
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
he
knows,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
those
can
only
be
within
the
scope
of
--
of
that
offense
and
--
and
whatever
testimony
he
gives
but
here,
there
are
no
limitations
rather
if
you're
theory
is
correct.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris,
i
understood
you
to
say
a
moment
ago
that
when
a
witness
was
asked
these
questions,
all
he
had
to
--
had
to
do
was
to
answer
them
and
there'd
be
no
harm
done.
do
you
think
that
in
this
day
and
age
when
--
when
we're
so
possessed
--
so
possessed
of
fear
and
dislike
of
the
--
of
the
communist
party
and
its
activities
that
if
the
--
if
a
committee
was
to
just
pull
a
man
off
of
the
street
and
say,
“are
you
a
communist?”
and
he
says,
“no.”
do
you
think
that
would
not
--
that
in
itself
would
not
be
any
great
injury
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
sometimes,
they
illegally
search
a
man's
place
and
they
don't
get
anything.
and
sometimes
you'd
find
the
same
situation
here
with
witnesses.
they'd
asked
him
questions
that
wouldn't
--
that
wouldn't
harm
anybody,
but
if
they
just
took
a
man
off
the
street
as
you
contend
to
have
the
right
to
do
and
without
any
knowledge
or
information
concerning
him
without
any
showing
of
any
kind,
they
just
bring
him
in
before
--
before
a
committee
and
the
american
public
and
say,
“are
you
a
communist?”
would
he
answer
--
would
his
answer
“no”
save
him
from
public
harm?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
true.
and
they
could
commit
--
they
can
commit
all
kinds
of
libel
that
they
want
on
the
floor
of
the
--
floor
of
the
congress,
but
does
it
mean
that
because
they
can
do
that,
they
can
--
they
can
otherwise
discredit
and
downgrade
people
in
any
other
way
that
they
want?
does
it
follow?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wasn't
talking
about
(voice
overlap)
exactly
what
this
was
--
i
was
trying
to
just
probe
a
little
of
your
statement
that
they
could
ask
him
any
question
they
wanted
and
all
he
had
to
do
was
answer.
and
if
his
answer
was
negative,
why
he
wasn't
harmed?
i
ask
you
within
this
--
the
setting
of
these
hearings.
if
--
if
a
man's
answer
is,
“no,
i'm
not
a
communist.”
would
leave
him
uninjured
be
--
before
the
american
--
before
the
american
public
--
publicized
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
these
things
are.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(

chief
justice
earl
warren
as
applied
to
him,
as
applied
to
this
witness,
or
as
applied
to
their
general
power
to
investigate
communism
which
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
accept
that
then
that
they
must
have
some
--
have
to
make
some
showing
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
ask
a
question
of
a
witness
such
as
we
have
under
review
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
here
arguing
a
certain
position
and
you
arrive
at
certain
conclusions.
can't
we
test
them?
how
far
you
want
--
how
far
you
want
to
go
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
i
merely
ask
you
if
you'd
go
that
far?if
you
don't,
i
want
to
ask
you
another
question.
if
you
say
you
do,
i
think
i'm,
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
won't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
won't
answer
my
question
as
to
--
as
to
whether
the
committee
can
--
can
pull
a
man
off
of
the
street
and
without
any
showing
to
the
witness,
say
to
him,
"are
you
a
communist?"
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
now
you
accept
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
accept
that
that
is
your
responsibility
then
in
this
and
every
other
case
of
--
of
--
of
this
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris,
i'm
wondering
if
there
isn't
another
distinction
between
these
two
kinds
of
procedure
if
in
a
case
of
this
kind
on
trial
when
he
goes
on
trial.
if
these
things
are
not
open
to
him,
he
has
no
way
of
--
of
ever
raise
--
raising
him
unless
he
--
unless
he
raises
it
at
the
instant
that
he's
called
as
a
witness
and
asked
the
question.
now,
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
procedure
or
in
the
congress,
but
if
they
took
him
before
the
--
the
bar
of
the
house
of
representatives
for
failing
to
answer
these
questions,
he'd
be
entitled
to
--
to
a
hearing
there,
would
he
not?
he
could
put
up
a
defense,
could
he
not,
before
the
--
before
the
congress
and
--
and
trash
these
things
out
and
--
and
we'd
have
a
--
we'd
have
a
record
on
it
before
it
ever
--
before
he
was
ever
sentenced
but
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no
your
--
your
contention
that
--
that
the
cong
--
that
the
committee
is
not
required
to
show
any
reasonable
grounds
for
--
for
insisting
upon
this
evidence
is
conclusive
and
that
when
it
comes
to
the
--
these
--
when
it
comes
to
the
court
and
there's
an
effort
to
put
him
in
jail,
he
has
no
--
he
has
no
defense
to
it
at
all
nor
did
he
have
before
the
committee
unless
when
the
--
when
he
came
then
was
confronted
by
the
question.
he
was
prepared
with
a
lawyer
and
to
--
to
represent
him
and
advise
him
of
his
rights.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
say
i'm
not
--
chief

warren
im
not
--
chief
justice

warren
i'm
not

i'm
not

--
with
--
with
that
procedure
over
there
but
i
was
wondering.
chief

warren
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
have
a
dozen
questions
as
10
times
due.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
conceivable,
it's
been
done
hasn't
it?only
the
--
only
the
judges
haven't
given
them
consecutive
sentences
here.
what
they've
been
convicted
on
a
--
on
a
great
number
of
counts
depending
upon
the
number
of
questions
they
refuse
to
answer.
and
under
the
law
--
under
the
law
--
they
can
be
given
consecutive
sentences
but
did
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
recall
it,
we
have
the
(voice

--
chief
justice

warren
--
on
one
case
here
where
--
where
one
of
these
cases
of
this

wasn't

didn't
set

either.
chief

well,
the
first
time
--
the
first
time
it
was
here,
we
did
not
it
set
it
aside
because
of
that.
at
the
end,
didn't
we
--
didn't
we
--
we
merely
--
the

merely
limited
the

to
the
amount
of
time
served
--

--
the
first

around.
that
was

well

cannot
be
tested
in
the
usual
way.

full

not
for

cannot
be
tested
according

other

the
man
makes
a
statement
and
sticks
to
it,

that
makes
your
case
even
though

even
though

even
though
there
are

even
though
there
are
things

and
take
away
from
you
--
chief

earl
warren
could
they
take
the
privilege
away
from
one
newspaper
and
--
not
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
--
i
understood
here
to
put
some
limitations
on
how
far
the
committee
could
go
in
investigating
this
situation
and
i
wonder
if
they
--
if
they
can
take
this
man
off
of
the
copy
desk
in
the
newspaper
and
ask
him
the
questions
that
they
asked
him,
why
they
couldn't
go
from
solar
to
garret
in
the
building
and
ask
everybody
up
to
it
and
including
the
publisher
whether
or
not
they
were
influenced
by
timeless
propaganda.
chief
justice
earl

could
they
--
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
they
could
not
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
you
think
if
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
new
york
times
and
the
new
york
herald
tribune
had
been
subject
to
this
influence
of
the
communists
that
those
who
are
guiding
the
destiny
of
the
papers,
those
who
are
controlling
the
policy
would
necessarily
have
as
much
interest
--
as
much
knowledge
about
it
as
the
man
on
the
copy
desk?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
possible
it
would
not
but
isn't
it
likewise
possible
if
they
would
if
it
had
actually
influence
the
output
of
the
paper,
do
you
not
think
that
the
publisher
of
the
paper
would
have
at
least
this
much
information
as
this
man
and
possibly
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
therefore
--
and
therefore
would
--
he
would
be
able
to
take
anybody
in
the
--
anybody
in
the
newspaper
and
quiz
them
along
the
same
lines
that
this
man
has
been
quizzed
insofar
as
the
influence
of

you've
had
very

your

we'll
give
you
five
minutes
in
rebuttal

you
decide
to

it.
chief

so,
the

may
have
five
minutes
extra
also.
chief

mr.
doolittle,
may
i
ask
if
that
is
all
testimony
that
is
also
--
was
also
brought
up
before
the
committee
or
is
this
--
chief

earl
warren
or
is
this
--
any
of
this
new
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question
now,
mr.
doolittle.
do
you
consider
yourself
bound
by
the
record
before
the
committee
in
that
respect
or
do
you
contend
that
the
government
witnesses,
in
order
to
prove
a
necessary
element
of
the
crime,
can
bring
in
testimony
that
was
not
before
the
committee
to
show
the
importance
to
the
government
and
the
importance
to
the
committee
of
the
testimony
that
it
sought
to
elicit
from
the
petitioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
disclosed
in
the
--
yes,
not
disclosed
in
the
hearing
at
which
petitioner
was
present.
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
do
that
in
rebuttal
or
do
you
do
that
in
your
case
in
chief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
do
it
in
your
case
in
chief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
introduce
such
testimony
in
your
case
in
chief,
that
is,
testimony
that
is
not
covered
by
the
record
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
hearing,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
you're
going
to
do
it
in
your
case
in
chief,
how
could
you
put
the
defense
to
the
test
of
making
a
strong
showing
before
you're
advised
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
when
there
was
a
strong
showing
by
the
defense
at
the
trial
that
--
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
showing
made,
that
you
could
put
on
testimony
to
prove
that
there
was,
that
this
had
been
done
because
of
proper
investigation
on
the
part
of
the
government.
but,
i
ask
you,
how
could
they
make
a
strong
showing
if
you're
going
to
put
on
the
testimony
in
your
case
in
chief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
make
any
difference,
in

whether
it
had
been
made
before
he
was

afterwards?

of

mr.

let
us
start
over
again.
are
you
able
to
tell
us
of
your
own
personal
knowledge
of
any
information
that
the
committee
had
on
mr.
price
prior
to
subpoenaing
him
to
appear
before
if
--
now,
then
he
goes
on
until
all
of
these
things
seem
about
the
courier
and
about
the
signing
of
this
statement
and
so
forth.
is
that
--
is
any
of
that
new
matter
and
if
so,
which
is
new
matter
so
far
as
the
petitioner
is
concerned
and
what
was
brought
out
in
his
presence
at
the
--
at
the
hearing
of
the
committee,
would
you
just
take
it
now
from
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
all
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
was
all
done
at
the
committee
hearing
in
the
presence
of
the
--
of
the
petitioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
tell
me
if
mr.
price
who
signed
that
--
that
statement
as
you
say
in
defense
of
the
communist
party,
was
that
in
fact
this
mr.
price?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
indication
that
it
is
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
that
--
i
understood
from
mr.
boudin
that
it
showed
that
it
was
a
man
from
swarthmore
county
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
this
man
had
never
been
there.
now
is
that
--
do
you
--
don't
count
an
indication?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
your
present
judgment
as
to
whether
--
whether
this
is
the
mr.
price
who
signed
that
statement
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
still
that
testimony
was
produced
against
him
on
his
trial
and
he
was
denied
--
denied
the
right
to
cross-examine
concerning
this,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
not
think
that
would
be
important
before
an
american
jury
at
this
--
at
this
particular
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
making
a
defense
of
the
communist
party,
you
don't
think
that
would
affect
him
very
much?
chief
justice
earl
warren
conceivably
it
might
--
don't
--
don't
you
--
don't
you
think
that
it
would?
chief

oh,
i
thought
this
was

one

was

mr.

may
i
ask
you
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
caustic
telegram
that
you
--
you
mentioned
yesterday
on
the
question
of
exposure
for
exposure's
sake,
would
your
position
be
the
same
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
don't
--
in
other
words,
you
don't
rely
on
that
telegram
as
provocation
for
the
things
that
were
said
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
if
it
were
not
for
that
telegram,
would
your
--
would
your
case
be
any
different
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
suppose,
in
either
of
those
cases,
there
was
anything
like
there
is
here
where
the
chairman
of
the
committee
says
that
he
feels
that
his
duty
to
put
this
union
out
of
business
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
just
wondered
if
--
if
you
thought
that
in,
in
and
of
itself
would
show
the
purpose
of
the
committee
or
whether
you
consider
that
that
was
provoked
by
the
telegram
and
was,
therefore,
excusable.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
before
or
after
--
that
report,
before
or
after
the
--
the
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
that
be
used
to
support
the
hearing
--
an
afterthought
in
what
was
written
by
the
committee
a
year
afterwards?
