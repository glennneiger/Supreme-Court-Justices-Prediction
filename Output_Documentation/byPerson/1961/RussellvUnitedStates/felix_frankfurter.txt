justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rauh,
you
said
a
minute
ago,
it
didn't
appear
on
the
subpoena.
what
the
--
why
he
was
called,
may
i
ask,
were
the
subpoenas
of
this
committee
customarily
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
practice
was.
or
in
--
generally,
in
congressional
investigations
in
which
people
who
are
summoned
to
appear
by
compulsive,
by
subpoena,
did
the
subpoena
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
they
have
--
the
purpose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
do
state
the
--
they
do
give
the
name
of
the
committee
or
the
subcommittee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
plus
the
room
and
so
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
counsel
--
does
he
have
counsel
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
have
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
mr.
morris
called
as
a
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
available?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
judge
morris.
this
is
robert
morris
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
go
back
here
on
the
fourth,
but
may
i
go
back
or
down
to
the
sixth,
do
you
emphasize
the
sixth?
what
part
of
the
sixth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
confrontation
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
said
he
hasn't
got
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
said
--
he
said
it's
in
the
possession
now
of
mr.
morris.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
said
in
the
record
and
he
said
he
--
“i
think
it
is
locked
in
the
safe
of
the
present
chief
counsel
robert
morris.”
“is
that
(inaudible)
internal
security
committee?”
“i'm
unable
to
say
for
sure,
but
i
doubt
it.”
“why
do
you
doubt
it?”
“i
think
it
is
locked
in
the
safe
of
the
present
chief
counsel,
mr.
robert
morris.”
that's
why
i
asked
you
whether
you
called
mr.
robert
morris.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
a
man
says,
“i
haven't
got
the
letter,”
and
he
tells
you
who
has
it,
(inaudible)
your
obligation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
(inaudible)
with
my
reading
of
english
mean
that
this
statement,
clearly
as
possible,
that
it's
now
locked
up
in
the
safe
of
mr.
robert
morris.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
say
you
prove
them
to
be
a
liar,
and
that
the
totality
shows
it
wasn't
--
that
that's
baseless
and
it's
still
in
his
possession,
then
i'll
listen
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
all
he
said
and
i've
just
read
you.
i
haven't
read
this
record.
could
you
point
out
to
me
where
there's
a
subsequent
contradiction
of
this
statement
that
the
doctrine
--
that
the
letter
is
locked
in
the
safe
of
the
present
chief
counsel
mr.
robert.
i'd
be
glad
if
you'll
show
me.
and
of
course
--
in
the
cases
where
subpoenas
are
issued
for
the
production
of
document,
it's
a
common
place,
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
about
these
people,
it's
a
common
place
that
the
subpoena
must
be
directed
to
the
custodian
of
the
document
and
if
--
if
it's
directed
to
x
and
x
is
brought
in
and
says,
“i
haven't
got
it,”
it's
x's,
it's
in
y's
custody,
unless
he
shifted
it
to
--
by
its
custody
after
the
subpoena,
and
therefore
subject
to
contempt
(inaudible)
you
got
to
go
after
y.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
case
is
going
to
turn
on
my
construction
of
what
i've
read
to
you
or
your
construction
of
what
i
read
to
you,
is
that
what
this
case
is
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
general
question
mr.
rauh.
if
i'm
subpoenaed
by
a
committee
of
congress,
let's
forget
this
committee,
any
committee,
the
agricultural
committee,
can
i
say
and
if
i
had
–
(inaudible)
just
to
review
my
point
sir,
and
i
say,
“would
you
please
tell
me
why
you're
asking
me
to
appear?
i've
had
the
subpoena.
but
before
i
answer
any
question,
you
must
tell
me
why
you
called
me?”
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
watkins,
seems
to
my
understanding
--
watkins
relates
to
the
pertinency
of
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
whether
people
are
summoned
before
--
since
watkins
or
since
evidently
from
here,
here
or
another,
may
a
witness
before
--
when
he
gets
his
subpoena
from
the
committee
on
agriculture
or
the
joint
committee
that
is
now
here
in
this
economic
testimony,
and
he
is
summoned,
may
say,
“please
tell
me
why
you're
asking
me
to
appear.
no
accident,
no
nothing.”
he
just
wants
to
know
whether
they
just
(inaudible)
and
scare
him
without
thought.
somebody
had
a
bright
idea
to
call
mr.
jones
or
professor
jones,
may
a
witness
here
at
all
to
say,
“please
tell
me
why
you've
summoned
me.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
constable
can't
do
it,
but
he
--
if
he
had
--
if
a
constable
--
i'm
sorry
to
trouble
you,
but
i'd
like
to
understand
something
that's
so
unsettled
in
my
mind.
but
if
a
constable
has
a
subpoena,
may
the
witness
say,
“i
won't
go
with
you
until
you
tell
me
why
they
issued
this
subpoena.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
say
it
in
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
he
does
is
--
if
for
some
reason,
the
subpoena
is
inadequate
under
--
on
such
the
particular
fourth
amendment,
he
can
move
to
quash
the
subpoena.
as
i
understand,
there's
nothing
like
that
has
done
here,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
understand
that
a
new
subpoena
was
issued
in
his
proper
name,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
get
me
to
say
you
have
to
have
probable
cause,
then
it's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you're
trying
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
give
me
one
decision
that's
so
decided
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible),
is
this
brimson?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
i.c.c.
against
brimson?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
154.
i'm
learning
a
lot
of
laws,
but
that's
the
fair
state,
mr.
rauh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
old
was
he
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
take
similar
ground
before
the
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
did
he
state
to
the
committee
he's
scrupulous
against
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
making
the
line,
not
merely
the
legal
grounds
but
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
have
that
from
the
record
here?
is
it
in
this
blue
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
appeared
before
the
senate
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
questioning
it,
i
just
want
to
look
at
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
blue
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
is
it
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
van
arkel,
suppose
i
agree
to
your
last
few
remarks,
the
last
statement
and
applied
it
in
regards
to
questioning
in
a
court
of
law
at
a
trial,
(inaudible)
in
a
trial
in
this
court,
these
questions
would
otherwise
be
relevant
and
suppose
that
dealing
first
by
(inaudible)
ethics
you
just
made,
you
came
up
in
federal
court,
i
would
say,
well
the
judge
in
his
discretion
ought
not
to
rely
on
these
questions,
assume
--
assuming
(inaudible)
i
haven't
that
freedom
or
power
with
reference
to
inquiring
before
a
congressional
committee
or
have
i
or
not
in
order
to
yield
to
your
argument
say,
must
i
conclude,
that
putting
these
questions,
whatever
i
may
think
of
the
ethical
offensiveness,
putting
these
questions
were
not
outside
the
constitutional
power
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
i
put
my
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
case
that
i
put
to
you
namely
reviewing
a
conviction
in
a
district
court
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
also
involves
the
(voice
overlap)
but
what
i
am
putting
you
it's
a
different
kind
of
value
in
reviewing
the
conduct
ex-trial
of
a
federal
district
judge
for
a
suit
affirmed
by
court
of
appeals,
i
can
say
that
a
judge
who
has
large
dis
--
considerable
discretion
at
least
an
undefined
amount
of
discretion
in
conducting
a
trial
in
which
evidence
though
relevant
admissible
ought
not
in
fairness
because
of
the
motion
that
it
arouses,
the
misguidance
it
gives
to
the
jury
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
you
should
have
shut
that
out,
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
when
it
comes
to
dealing
with
the
thing
kind
of
questions
or
in
pursuit
for
the
same
questions
before
a
committee
of
congress,
i
have
that
much
that
kind
of
freedom
in
balancing,
do
i?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
you
go
with
me
in
the
distinction
that
i
--
that
i
indicated
this
morning;
namely,
you
go
with
me
with
the
distinction
or
do
you
say
rather
that
you
take
the
distinction
that
in
my
question
i
rejected,
namely,
if
mr.
whitman
have
been
brought
before
the
bar
--
was
it
the
house
or
the
senate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
whitman
has
been
brought
before
the
bar
of
the
senate,
on
a
report
by
the
chairman
of
the
particular
committee
that
found
him
in
contempt
and
the
senate
had
then
exercising
its
power,
implied
powers
to
be
in
contempt
before
the
senate,
itself
dealt
with
this
problem
and
gave
the
man
the
same
sentence,
it
was
authorized
to
give
the
same
sentence
$500.00
and
six
months
and
then
he
sought
out
habeas
corpus,
your
argument
implies
that
it
would
have
been
my
duty,
assuming
you're
advising
me,
it
would
have
been
my
duty
if
it
is
my
duty
to
reverse
this,
it
would
have
been
my
duty
to
say
habeas
corpus
proper.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
draw
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suggested
to
you
our
reviewing
power
overruling
in
the
district
court
will
not
require
disagreement
on
the
score
of
the
provision
of
the
constitution,
but
namely
they
go
out
power
as
supervisors
of
the
lower
federal
courts.
and
i
further
suggest
to
you,
or
rather
recall
to
you,
that
which
i
have
no
doubt
you
know,
that
in
the
maccracken
case,
it
was
made
specifically
clear
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
writing
for
an
unanimous
court
that
the
reason
for
the
1857
act
under
which
this
prosecution
is
brought,
it
didn't
have
to
do
with
any
of
these
things,
the
reason
was
in
order
to
permit
heavier
sentences
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
power
of
a
congressional
committee
would
expire
at
the
end
of
the
session
and
therefore
the
punishments
would
terminate
at
the
end
of
the
session.
and
the
reason
for
the
act
of
1857
was
not
an
alleviating
reason
at
all,
it
was
an
enforcing
reason
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time,
but
the
maccracken
case
also
makes
clear
that
the
same
restriction
against
abuse
of
constitutional
rights
limits
congress.
it
said
it
is
protected
if
you
have
either
as
in
kilburn
and
thompson
was
found
that
congress
had
no
duty
and
no
power
or
in
the
later
case
that
it
has
exceeded
it,
so
that
--
but
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
is
that
indictment
mr.
fanelli?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
ask
bills
of
the
particulars?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
fanelli
may
not
have
the
time.
if
i
may
miss
--
the
comment
you
were
going
to
make
about
the
bill
of
blank
--
about
the
bill
of
particulars.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
guess
what
i
know
whether
--
may
i
ask
this
question
and
you
can
answer
later?
would
no
bill
of
particulars
cure,
assuming
you're
right
about
the
defect,
is
this
is
an
incurable
defect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
--
just
want
to
know
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
in
--
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
whatever
difference
there
maybe
between
an
opening
statement,
i
suppose
there
were
some
difference
between
talk
and
the
deliberateness
of
a
bill
of
particular,
but
waiving
that
you
say
this
is
--
this
was
an
incurable
inadequacy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
falling
short
of
the
requirement
of
the
constitutional
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
maroney,
have
we
got
any
figures
--
government
got
figures
to
indicate
the
total
potential
jury
qualified
versus
in
the
district
and
the
total
number
of
government
employees
that
could
be
taken
out
of
that
pool?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
is
--
if
it's
--
if
it's
very
easy
to
get,
would
you
mind?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
making
--
there's
no
(inaudible),
i'm
just
curious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
you're
getting
to
a
greatest
social
magnet
for
people
who
come
here
because
it's
such
a
wonderfully
interesting
place,
with
all
the
wonderful
things
going
on,
cultural
center,
103
embassies,
etcetera,
etcetera,
lots
of
leisured
bias
people
now
make
it
their
home.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
mr.
fanelli,
your
argument
and
(inaudible)
is
that
if
indictment
had
specified
what
the
subject
that
the
inquiry
was,
the
government
would
be
nailed
down
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
the
same
--
the
same
restriction,
the
same
confinement
for
maneuvering
on
part
of
the
government
is
served
by
the
bill
of
particulars.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
will
list
it,
if
you
ask
for
bill
of
particulars,
you
may
say
that
subject
--
the
scope
of
the
inquiries
asked
him
so
the
bill
of
particulars
hold
him
to
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
say
no?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
bill
of
particulars.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
in
other
words
the
--
the
specificity
doesn't
come
from
the
grand
jury,
but
so
far
as
any
fairness
or
unfairness,
waving
the
question
whether
a
grand
--
an
indictment
can
be
amended.
i
appreciate
that
argument,
but
on
the
question
of
fairness,
the
bill
of
particulars
has
the
same
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
giving
you
notice.
i'm
giving
you
notice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
interest
of
time
of
i'm
interrupting
you
--
in
the
court
of
appeals,
say
although
the
bill
of
particulars
bound
into
this.
although,
the
government
says
the
bill
of
particulars
restricts
are
put
to
this,
the
court
of
appeals
can
go
beyond
that
or
differ
from
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
next
time
you
have
a
situation
in
putting
the
first
point
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
start
this,
i'd
like
to
--
of
what's
going
with
justice
black's
question
from
a
different
point
of
view
not
joining,
but
i
ask
you
a
question
in
reference
to
it.
are
we
dealing
with
the
immediate
case
before
us
on
the
assumption
of
the
un-american
committee
investigations
to
present
legal
questions
ad
hoc
as
it
grow
with
reference
to
that
committee?
is
there
going
to
be
--
is
that
being
build
up
with
jurisprudence
specially
with
reference
to
un-american
committee
investigations
or
are
we
talking
about
congressional
investigations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
i
suppose
(voice
overlap)
then
your
answer
to
justice
black's
question
is
inadequate.
if
you
say
in
these
cases,
witnesses
have
--
100%
of
them
have
lawyers.
that
doesn't
reach
my
concern
of
what
the
scope,
the
right,
the
power,
the
constitutional
power,
and
the
constitutional
limitations
of
congressional
investigations
not
un-american
committee
investigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
your
answer
isn't
adequate
or
it
doesn't
meet
justice
black's
question
if
i
may
say
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
with
reference
to
this
committee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
then
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
--
the
volume
of
questions
that
have
come
up
but
we've
had
other
committees.
this
isn't
the
first
time
that
these
questions
arise.
there
been
congressional
investigations
in
the
very
first
congress,
in
the
very
first
session
of
the
very
first
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
certainly,
i
don't
have
to
tell
you.
there's
been
litigation
in
this
court
and
decisions
dealing
with
investigations
long
before
anybody
ever
thought
of
the
un-american
committee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
purpose
of
mine
eventually
is
to
understand
whether
you're
going
to
limit
yourself
to
the
series
of
cases
that
have
come
before
us
and
now
before
us
arising
out
of
the
un-american
committee
investigation,
all
you've
been
talking
about
the
constitutional
powers
and
limitations
upon
congressional
investigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
continue
to
say
“the
committee”.
i'm
saying
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
a
committee
of
congress
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
pertains
to
utility
company
or
to
general
macarthur's
dismissal
if
he
was
dismissed
or
retirement
whatever
the
phrase
is
with
respect
to
him
or
whether
it's
a
reference
to
senator
thurman's
perspective
committee
inquiry
or
all
of
multitude
of
subject
matters
that
have
been
the
subject
of
congressional
investigations
ever
since
the
sinclair
military
expeditions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
the
witness
who
is
summoned
to
appear
in
court,
know
what
he's
going
to
--
he's
going
to
be
asked
to
testify
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
actually
told
what
--
why
he's
being
summoned?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
be
--
this
is
the
threshold
question
where
they
can
ask,
whether
he
must
have
the
committee
justify
to
him
why
they
issued
a
subpoena
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
him
in
an
investigation
which
is
defined
by
the
congressional
authorization
to
that
committee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
terris,
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
why
you
don't
say
that
it
is
within
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
conduct
investigation
which
results
in
damage
to
perfectly
innocent
citizens.
but
which
there
is
no
judicial
power
release,
why
don't
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
a
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
a
fact
that
comes,
that
people
may
draw
inferences
from
questions
that
of
the
court
which
are
within
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
put
and
for
which
there
is
no
judicial
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
say
that
plainly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
correcting
all
the
abusive
which
congress
may
exercise
in
its
constitutional
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
question
of
phrasing
it's
the
question
of
conduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
one
of
the
prices
that
citizens
pay
in
courts
before
committees
and
they've
always
paid
them.
and
the
question
is
what
other
limits
to
a
judicial
relief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
this
court
has
judicial
review
of
the
procedure
of
congress.
there
are
limits
to
what
--
to
the
power
of
that
congress.
this
court
had
said
it
has
power
and
it
has
limitations
upon
its
power.
but
is
there
any
doubt
that
innocent
people
have
involved
before
committees
of
congress
from
the
beginning
of
time
and
asked
questions
which
may
do
them
harm
in
their
--
in
their
community
or
among
their
friends
or
among
the
ignorance
or
among
the
life
for
which
there
is
no
judicial
relief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
that's
a
simple
answer.
of
the
limit
of
something
else
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
--
may
i
ask
a
couple
question
with
that
so
you
can
answer
the
fact,
i'd
like
to
know
whether
you
think,
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
scope,
the
right,
the
demand
upon
congressional
procedures
so
that
defiance
of
congressional
request
to
answer
may
not
be
enforced
to
the
criminal
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
on
the
kilbourn
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
be
concrete
and
say,
if
shelton,
instead
of
congress
referring
this
contempt
in
its
view
to
the
united
states
attorney
or
the
district
attorney
and
told
the
sheriff
that
the
sergeant-at-arms
could
bring
in
before
the
court
--
the
bar
of
congress
and
it
impose
exactly
the
same
offenses
and
it
put
him
in
charge
of
the
appropriate
arresting
officer
of
the
district,
you
would
then
have
done
exactly
what
was
done
here,
as
what
it's
done
in
kilbourn
against
thompson
to
sue
out
a
habeas
corpus
because
of
the
illegal
commitment
by
the
congress,
by
the
senate
when
it
exceeded
its
constitutional
power
to
do
what
it
claimed
to
be
beyond
its
constitutional
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
exactly
the
same
question
with
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
killbourn
was
let
out,
mr.
terris?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
terris,
we
talked
--
we
discussed
these
things
in
the
abstract
about
calling
in
a
man
off
the
street,
suppose
as
i
see
thus
move
it,
there'll
be
a
congressional
investigation
regarding
the
complaint
of
the
reserve
officer
to
observe
the
man
and
suppose
a
member
of
the
committee
of
congress
sees
a
man
with
reserve
uniform
(inaudible)
but
suppose
he's
identified
as
a
reserve,
the
man
is
a
reserve
(inaudible)
and
he
detain
this
man
until
a
subpoena
could
be
issued
for
him,
but
you
need
--
that's
a
man
off
the
street,
you
could
put
him
and
ask
him
about
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
about
or
fourth
or
fifth
or
any
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
asking
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
the
congress
doesn't
say
he's
going
to
bring
you
in
under
the
fourth
and
not
under
the
fifth,
under
the
first
but
not
under
the
sixth.that
is
the
way
congress
operates
and
never
did
operate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
they
bring
him
into
this
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
although
he's
from
the
street?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
can
discuss
these
things
from
(inaudible)
abstract
without
getting
anywhere
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
where
we
start
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
reminds
me
that
the

of

get

justice

propel

justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rauh,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
have
i
followed
--
i
followed
his
interest.
i
do
not
vouch
for
it
with
an
appreciation,
but
i
followed
with
interest
your
argument
and
am
i
right
in
inferring
that
if
the
chairman
of
a
committee
had
said
to
a
witness
and
this
witness'
position,
would
he
ask
him,
"why
am
i
here?"
if
the
chairman
said,
"i
can
assure
you
we
have
a
very
good
reason
for
putting
these
questions
to
you,
but
there
are
also
very
good
reasons
but
i'm
not
disclosing
the
reason."
that
would
still
be
subject
to
your
condemnation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
seem
--
i
don't
see
why
it
isn't
relevant
because
that's
precisely
what
took
place
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
were
my
lawyer
mr.
rauh,
would
you
advise
me
to
--
i
should
ask
counsel
what
right
they
had
to
infer
from
the
fact
that
i
put
a
question
that
that's
my
conclusion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
knowledge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
agreed
to
argue
the
opinion
for
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
automatically,
with
the
reservation
--
with
an
express
reservation
in
terms
by
the
congress
that
it
is
under
no
duty
to
respond
to
the
subpoena.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
right
if
you
are
entitled
to
the
--
to
the
letter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
letter
was
relevant
to
this
--
was
--
it
was
necessary
to
prove
the
ingredients
of
the
crime
and
if
either
the
government
or
the
congress
will
pose
an
essential
piece
of
documentation
to
prove
the
crime,
then
of
course
you
must
go
free.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
these
have
to
be
answered
first.
justice
felix
frankfurter
won't
you
agree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
recognize
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rauh,
isn't
the
first
amendment
involved
every
time
i'm
asked
to
talk
when
i
want
to
keep
silent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
it
--
not
maybe,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
have
a
right
to
keep
silent
even
--
even
though
what
i
say
maybe
frivolous
or
irrelevant
or
meaningless.
i'm
a
neurotic
about
keeping
silent
when
i
don't
have
to
talk,
now
that's
a
first
amendment
protection,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
not
into
the
first
amendment.
i
thought
that
is
the
clearest
thing
in
the
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
all
good
conscience,
in
all
good
conscience
mr.
rauh,
if
i'm
asked
to
give
my
view
about
a
subject,
one
exercising
authority
either
as
a
judge
--
or
the
chairman
of
a
senate
committee,
it
isn't
frivolous
for
me
to
say
it's
none
of
your
business
if
it
isn't
any
of
his
business.
now,
i
don't
think
you
can
really
differentiate
on
my
right
to
withhold
disclosure
of
my
views
on
any
subject
if
anybody
in
authority
has
no
business
to
elicit.
i
don't
think
you
can
make
that.
at
least
i
cannot
i
understand,
how
they
can
be
degrees
of
privacy
to
be
--
to
be
breached
by
a
public
authority
when
he
has
no
authority
to
do
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
the
only
committee
you've
been
exercising
this
kind
of
authority
and
has
been
a
(inaudible)
as
this
committee
has
been.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
well
--
very
well
know
that
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
are
here
--
you
are
here
in
the
context
of
--
of
a
claim
that
this
court
was
here
to
incur
congressional
investigatorial
power
in
order
to
tell
a
witness
when
it
summons
him
in
advance
why
it
has
something.
you
are
making
that
claim
and
that
is
your
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
well
brought
up
mr.
rauh
and
you
know
that
was
said
in
the
context
of
a
particular
situation
where
the
witness
didn't
have
the
remotest
idea,
wasn't
told
there
was
an
indication
why
he's
being
asked
a
question
that
he
is
being
asked.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
continue
that
elsewhere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
doolittle
does
the
press
enjoy
a
special
hostile
favors
in
the
interest
of
other
means
of
transmission
to
the
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
congress
take
those
favors
away?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
what
director,
mr.
rand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
statement
from
a
particular
w--
particular
hearing,
particular
witness,
regarding
a
particular
piece
of
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
otherwise
obtainable
from
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
same
would
apply
to
a
court
proceeding,
i
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
same
would
apply
for
a
proceeding
in
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
witness
is
called.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everywhere
where
there's
of
course
power
to
make
a
man
open
his
mouth
when
he
wants
to
keep
it
shut.
where
there's
an
attempt
by
a
legal
person
to
make
a
man
open
his
mouth
when
he
wants
to
keep
it
shut.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
means
that
if
defendant's
counsel
in
a
criminal
case
wants
to
stipulate
a
fact
unequivocally
and
ambiguously,
the
prosecution
must
accept
that
stipulation
and
not
call
witness
to
that
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
you
explain
the
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
a
larceny
case,
instead
of
a
murder
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
make
it
as
a
trespass
case.
make
it
anything,
while
he's
getting
a
trial
in
a
court
and
the
question
is
his
guilt
or
innocence.
the
materiality
of
it,
how
much
time
is
afforded
for
the
government
to
get
it
in
court
trials
in
order
to
demand
to
have
due
process
of
law
as
compared
with
the
right
to
get
evidence
which
the
court
said
in
the
first
discussion
of
the
whole
question
is
to
be
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
desire,
namely,
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
enable
the
government
to
pass
a
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
assume
the
defendant
said,
“i
don't
want
any
witnesses
against
me.
i
want
to
save
time,
money,
and
inconvenience.
i
admit
the
following
facts
and
i
want
to
know
whether
when
the
defendant,
himself,
is
protecting
his
due
process
by
admissions.”
you
can
say
the
prosecution
can't
be
allowed
to
put
witnesses
on
the
stand
to
human
testimony
and
confirming
testimony,
although
that
testimony
has
been
in
by
3
or
2
previous
witnesses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
i
consider
the
principles
you
are
proposing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
isn't
just
18.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
put
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
put
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
whether
in
a
trial
in
which
a
defendant,
for
his
own
protection,
gets
up
to
eminent
counsel
and
says
“i
admit
the
following
facts,”
unequivocally,
unambiguously,
is
the
prosecution
shut
off
from
accepting
that
fact,
that
stipulation,
and
saying,
“no,
i
want
to
put-in
human
testimony
to
establish
fact
and
to
confirm
it
by
having
four
witnesses
swear
to
it
because
the
jury
may
not
be
convinced
by
one
witness.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
defendant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
says,
“i
don't
want
to
prosecute
you
to
put
on
a
dramatic,
persuasive
witness
who
will
unduly
influence
the
jury.
i'm
admitting
all
these
facts
and,
therefore,
i
object.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
protecting
his
own
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
i'll
have
the
witness'
counsel,
an
eminent
counsel
of
a
witness
who's
called
who'll
test
against
having
his
client
open
his
mouth
because
the
facts
are
already
conclusively
in
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wasn't
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wasn't
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
was
quite
different
and,
from
my
point
of
view,
you
do
have
to
answer
my
question
for
me
to
understand
what
you
are
arguing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
because
you
don't
think
so,
but
i'm
just
telling
you
my
mind
and
not
your
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
therefore,
whether
that
means
that,
in
every
congressional
investigation,
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
when
john
doe
is
called
as
a
witness,
must
explain
to
him
why
--
state
to
him
the
specific
knowledge
in
the
possession
of
the
committee
that
makes
it
relevant
to
call
him
and
relevant
to
ask
the
question
that
he's
being
asked.
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
escape
it
from
your
point
of
view
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
ask,
if
you
summon
a
witness
without
having
knowledge
--
revealable
knowledge
as
to
the
reasons
for
asking
him
and
if
it
is
important
or
constitutionally
necessary
to
tell
him
why
he's
being
asked
specific
questions,
why
is
a
duty
of
a
chairman
of
a
committee
to
tell
that,
the
burden
is
on
the
committee
to
tell
that
to
a
witness
before
he's
interrogated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
the
witness
here
asked,
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--are
the
things
being
confused
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
mr.
rand,
i
put
it
to
you,
in
all
good
conscience,
if
that's
the
constitutional
requirement,
then
it
not
only
be
who
but
it
is
demanded
of
the
chairman
of
each
senate
or
house
committee
to
put
that
into
the
record
when
he
summoned
--
when
a
witness
appears
before
it
and
from
questions
of
court,
or
else,
you're
running
the
great
danger
of
retroactive
testimony
as
to
what
was
in
the
minds
of
people
who
didn't
disclose
their
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
same
thing
would
be
true
if
the
congress
exerts
or
exercises
its
own
power
of
committing
for
contempt.
i
do
not
see
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
see
that
there's
more
limitation
because
of
the
first
amendment
on
a
court
than
there
is
on
congress,
and
therefore,
mcgrain
and
dougherty,
mccracken,
every
blessed
investigation
from
the
beginning
of
time
would
require
or
would
in
the
future
require
a
chairman
to
make
a
solemn,
serious,
detailed
account
speech
to
the
witness
as
to
why
he's
there
and
why
he's
being
asked
these
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
depends
what
you
mean
by
balancing
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'll
next
have
a
scale
brought
into
court
and
weigh
it
in
a
proper
guarded
scale
rather
than
balancing
an
offense
in
which
it
will
delineate
it
in
those
prior
decisions.
you
may
not
like
them,
but
there
they
are.
they
may
be
overruled
but
here
they
are
up
to
this
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
was
the
judge?
do
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
this
--
where
is
this
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
he
a
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
is
just
--
news
paper
man
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
mr.
doolittle
is
here
to
be
cross-examined
and
mr.
lippman
is
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
mind
you're
stating
the
views
of
mr.
lippman
as
your
own.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
do
--
we're
getting
off
pretty
far
when
every
--
every
news
column
has
made
a
relevant
argument
with
an
inference
it's
almost
evidentiary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
all
due
respect
to
mr.
lippman,
whom
i've
known
for
the
rest
of
almost
my
whole
life.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
are
and
he
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
incidentally
that
shows
from
what
justice
--
from
what
the
court
then
understood
(inaudible)
in
the
problems?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
notion
that
this
just
began
with
the
un-american
committee
is
--
fly
right
in
the
face
of
the
whole
history
of
the
legislative
investigation
from
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
because
we
live
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
they're
vivid
and
contemporaneous,
they
were
just
as
--
they
had
just
--
it
came
to
mention
in
kilbourn
against
thompson,
and
in
maccracken,
and
in
the
utility
investigation
and
all
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
bear
on
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
trying
to
give
this
a
historical
perspective
speaking
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
only
becomes
--
it's
going
on
a
joyride.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
donner,
the
right
to
keep
quiet
is
just
as
pressured
when
it
comes
from
a
utility
tycoon
or
from
an
ex-communist.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
there
be
any
difference
to
you
if
mr.
walter
had
been
--
had
been
tight-lipped
and
not
made
that
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
a
difference
to
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
he
was
asked
to
do
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
point?
every
--
every
senator
who's
in
charge
of
a
committee
hearing
involving
a
public
interest
wants
the
whole
united
states
to
be
informed
and
as
it
were
to
the
extent
that
they
can
act
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
every
senator
or
congressmen
who's
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
does
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
am
asking
you,
whether
you
think
your
case
would
be
different
if
he
hadn't
said
a
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
do
you
think
senator
thomas
j.
walsh
and
senator
lafollette
a
when
they
expose
the
corruption
in
regard
teapot
dome
and
harry
daugherty?
what
do
you
think
their
purpose
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
they
must
insulate
against
exposure.
that's
your
present
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
a
piece
of
evidence?
was
it
introduced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
introduced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
he
was
indicted
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what's
the
relevance
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
even
follow
that.
however,
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
maroney,
does
the
--
the
ground
of
objections
--
the
statement
of
objections
to
which
you've
just
referred
cover
the
claims
of
invalidity
urged
by
mr.
donner
or
are
you
claiming
that
some
of
the
things
now
urged
--
urged
in
the
court
have
not
been
raised
at
the
committee
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
--
i've
read
it
and
i
know
what's
in
it.
i
just
want
you
to
tell
me
whether,
in
this
case
as
in
prior
cases,
the
government
says
that
some
of
the
points
raised
in
the
court
--
in
the
court
proceedings
had
not
been
raised
at
the
hearing.
have
we
got
any
such
question
in
this
case?
