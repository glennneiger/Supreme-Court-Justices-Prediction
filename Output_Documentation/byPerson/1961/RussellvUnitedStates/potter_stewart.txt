justice
potter
stewart
he
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
answered
good
many
preliminary
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
where
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
testimony
at
--
at
the
criminal
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
the
date
of
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
did
you
at
the
trial
though?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
talking
about,
at
least
--
i'm
talking
about
two
different
things.
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
got
a
handy
reference
to
the
transcript
of
what
you've
raised
in
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
did
any
one
of
those
three
opinions
talking
--
mentioned
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
the
statement
that
you
just
read
was
made
by
this
petitioner
at
his
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
the
district
court
find
that
--
that
the
subject
under
inquiry
was
or
didn't
--
or
wasn't
there
any
subject?
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
is
the
yellow
springs
from
dayton,
20
miles?
justice
potter
stewart
its
part
of
the
proof
that
this
was
not
exposure
for
exposure
sake?
justice
potter
stewart
well
(voice
overlap)
we're
talking
about
your
contention
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
not
be
--
fully
answering
mr.
rauh,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wasn't
that
just
a
matter
of
credibility
from
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
you're
entitled
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
not
a
jury
case
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rauh.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
that
it's
important
to
my
--
to
my
understanding
of
your
brief.
what's
your
distinction
--
what
distinction
do
you
make
between
this
kind
of
a
subpoena
to
mr.
shelton
and
a
subpoena
to
an
ordinary
witness
in
a
civil
action
of
the
federal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
like
talking
about
the
federal
court.
now
let's
--
let's
assume
this
kind
of
case
to
make
it
--
let's
assume
a
--
as
a
civil
action
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
assault
and
battery
allegedly
--
allegedly
committed
at
a
communist
meeting
here
and
you
--
you
subpoena
some
supposed
people
who
are
at
that
meeting
and
you
saw
the
--
saw
the
thing
happened.
i
would
so
assume
that
kind
of
case
in
the
federal
court.
now
what's
the
distinction
between
subpoenaing
even
mistakenly
people
as
witnesses
in
that
kind
of
a
case
and
a
subpoena
here?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
let's
the
say
the
first
question
is
--
is
--
to
him
is,
"where
are
you
at
that
communist
meeting
that
night?"
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
refuse
to
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
--
he
won't
say
no
to
that
question
under
my
case.
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
mr.
shelton
would
not
say
no.
justice
potter
stewart
this
civil
action
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
dissenting
opinions
in
barenblatt
and
wilkinson
render
those
cases
that
way,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
words
you
quoted,
they
are
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
maroney,
i
don't
know
how
much
relevance
it
is,
but
just
to
enlighten
my
ignorance,
section
9
(h)
is
--
was
repealed
in
1959,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
substituted
in
its
place,
could
you
tell
us?
justice
potter
stewart
but
something
else
was
enacted.
justice
potter
stewart
union
office.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
are
the
sanctions
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
--
what
are
the
present
sanctions
to
enforce
those
provisions?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
criminal
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
on
his
part.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
sanction
against
the
union
as
there
was
in
the
provisions
of
9
(h)?
9
(h),
of
course,
prevented
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
took
away
from
the
union
the
protected
--
the
protection
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
recall
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we're
pretty
far-field
from
the
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
did
mention
it
and
i
was
curious.
