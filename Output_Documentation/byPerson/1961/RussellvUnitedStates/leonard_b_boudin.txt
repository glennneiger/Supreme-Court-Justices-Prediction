mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner,
william
price,
a
reporter
at
the
time
on
the
new
york
daily
news,
seeks
review
here
of
his
conviction
by
the
court
in
the
district
of
columbia,
judge
keech,
sitting
without
a
jury
under
2
u.s.c.
192.
this
is
part
of
the
same
series
of
hearings,
which
are
involved
in
the
three
preceding
cases
other
than
--
other
than
russell
and
which
was
also
the
subject
of
an
opinion
by
judge
youngdahl
in
united
states
against
peck
which
deals
with
and
disposes
in
our
favor
of
the
constitutional
issues
and
which
i
will
not
discuss
until
the
end
of
my
argument
on
the
more
technical
aspects
of
the
case.
now,
the
petitioner
here
was
called
in
both
executive
and
public
sessions.
the
executive
in
december
1955,
a
public
in
january
1956
and
the
questions
that
were
put
to
him
were
over
a
wide
reach,
covering
such
matters
as
his
activities
in
a
labor
union
of
these
paper
men,
that
is
his
running
for
office,
his
knowledge
of
a
particular
young
woman
whose
name
appears
in
the
record,
his
traveling
as
a
pilot
in
an
airplane,
he'd
been
in
the
navy
in
latin
america
after
the
war
and
finally
the
usual
question
of
communist
party
membership
and
meetings.
this
was
a
very
wide
range
as
your
honors
will
see
when
i
point
out
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
was
never
indicated
to
this
petitioner.
but
what
is
particularly
significant
since
the
petitioner
here
has
been
indicted
and
convicted
not
for
his
appearance
in
december,
1955
but
his
appearance
in
january,
1956
is
that
the
questions
put
to
him,
as
developed
by
mr.
rand
upon
the
trial
of
his
trial
counsel,
were
identical
in
the
executive
session
of
december,
1955
and
the
public
session
of
january,
1956,
raising,
therefore,
the
question
which
we
do
raise
here
mr.
justice
harlan
as
to
the
legislative
purpose
of
a
second
inquiry
which
is
the
only
subject
here
of
this
appeal.
now,
i
may
say
here
that
your
honors
will
read
the
record
of
the
executive
as
incorporated
here
and
the
public
hearings
to
see
that
the
petitioner
denied
all
wrongdoing
because
various
insinuations
were
made
by
the
government
counsel
--
by
committee
counsel.
and
your
honors
--
honors
will
note
that
the
petitioner
did
raise
the
question
of
legislative
purpose
not
relying
merely
upon
the
arguments
of
conscience
discussed
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
deutch
case,
did
say
why
am
i
here,
did
say
there
is
no
legislative
purpose
and
at
no
point,
not
only
was
the
subject
of
--
not
only
was
pertinency
not
showing,
but
at
no
point
in
this
hearing
was
the
subject
matter
indicated
to
the
petitioner.
now,
the
petitioner,
after
being
indicted
by
a
jury
composes
as
in
the
other
cases,
a
majority
of
whom
the
government
employees,
made
the
motions
to
dismiss
the
indictment
which
is
set
forth
in
the
record
and
a
motion
was
denied
and
also
made
--
served
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
upon
the
committee
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
and
no
legislative
purpose
for
subpoenaing
him.
and
that
motion
--
that
subpoena
duces
tecum
was
quashed
and
the
motion
was
denied
and
the
petitioner
proceeded
to
trial.
at
the
trial,
counsel
for
the
government
insisted
that
the
subject
matter
of
inquiry
was
the
total
strategy
and
tactics
of
world
communism
and
counsel
for
the
committee,
to
the
extent
that
he
testified
on
the
subject
and
as
the
government
says
correctly
in
its
brief
somewhat
ambiguous
testimony,
the
testimony
that
government
relied
on,
counsel
for
the
government
again
said
it
was
world
communism
generally,
but
there
is
an
exhibit
introduced
namely
the
full
committee
hearings
in
which
senator
hennings
as
your
honors
will
recall
and
one
other
senator
talked
about
the
investigation
of
news
media
and
so
the
government
here
on
appeal
says,
“no,
it
was
not
an
investigation
the
world
communism
really.
it
was
an
investigation
of
media”,
although
that
is
not
consistent
with
mr.
sourwine's
testimony
on
this
point
at
the
trial.
the
trial
court
in
this
case,
whatever
it
maybe
done
and
i
don't
recall
what
the
activity
the
trial
courts
in
these
other
cases,
made
no
finding
as
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
except
stated
it
was
a
proper
inquiry
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
no
statement
as
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
so
that
we
are
compelled
to
rest
upon
these
divergent
points
of
view
expressed
by
the
government
here
and
by
mr.
sourwine
below
and
by
the
record
itself.
but,
your
honors
will
recall
what
i
said
before
that
at
the
time
of
the
committee
hearing,
assuming
luminosity
as
that
term
is
now
used
here
to
be
important,
the
witness
was
not
told
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry.
now,
we
raise
here
in
this
short
argument,
the
following
points
principally.
first,
was
there
reasonable
cause
or
legislative
purpose
or
justification
for
calling
mr.
price,
either
at
the
executive
session
and
certainly
at
the
public
session,
which
is
the
subject
of
his
inquiry?
secondly,
assuming
that
the
government
made
or
attempted
to
make
a
showing
of
such
legislative
purpose,
was
defense
counsel
here
as
in
liveright,
permitted
adequately
to
cross-examine
mr.
sourwine,
the
sole
witness
on
this
point
and
thirdly,
was
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
shown
to
the
witness
at
the
time
of
the
hearing?
i
may
not
reach
this
third
point
where
the
several
others
which
are
dealt
with
in
our
brief.
now,
as
to
probable
cause,
this
is
one
of
those
unusual
cases
in
which
the
committee
counsel
admitted
that
they
had
no
evidence
placing
mr.
price
in
the
communist
party.
in
most
cases,
the
claim
was
made,
sometimes
it's
supported,
here
no
such
claim
is
made.
what
then
was
the
reason
for
calling
mr.
price,
a
reporter
on
a
daily-news
internationally
known
for
its
conservative
events,
if
i
may
use
that
term?
three
reasons
are
given
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
none
of
these
reasons
separately
or
cumulatively
deserves
--
deserve
a
subpoena
by
any
rational
approach.
first,
that
mr.
price
ran
as
a
candidate
on
a
newspaper
guild
slate
for
office
which
mr.
sourwine,
without
a
single
word
of
evidence,
a
single
claim
of
support
except
something
like
public
repute
said
was
a
communist
slate.
i
passed
over
the
question
of
the
effect
on
trade
union
elections
if
a
man
who
runs
for
office
can
therefore
be
subpoenaed
and
come
down
merely
to
the
question
or
whether
that
was
a
reasonable
thing
here.
the
second
reason
given
by
mr.
sourwine
is
that
the
petitioner,
the
petitioner
here
knew
this
young
woman
whom
that
--
whom
mr.
sourwine
testified
was
a
communist
courier.
and
these
are
very
serious
charges
to
make
against
anybody
particularly
by
committee
counsel
under
the
public
privilege
and
i
point
out
to
your
honors
that
there
is
not
a
word
in
this
record
to
justify
that
kind
of
defamatory
statement
made
as
a
justification
for
calling
a
newspaperman
on
the
daily
news.
more,
more,
the
record
here
shows
that
the
lady
involved
had
testified
before
the
same
committee
six
--
some
months
before
and
had
not
asserted
privilege
in
answer
to
questions
put
to
her.
this
is
mr.
sourwine's
statement
at
the
end
of
his
testimony,
yet,
this
is
argued
as
a
reason
for
calling
a
newspaperman
because
he
had
some
relationship
rather
with
a
young
woman,
not
a
reasonable
thing
at
least
for
congressional
committee.
thirdly,
and
this
i
think
is
the
most
disturbing,
mr.
sourwine's
said
to
mr.
price,
he
believes,
he
didn't
know,
had
joined
in
a
statement
printed
in
a
daily
worker,
a
communist
newspaper
if
your
honors
please,
in
defense
of
the
communist
party.
now,
it
is
true,
let's
assume
that,
it
is
true
that
the
statement
as
printed
by
the
house
of
the
american
activities
committee
in
a
volume
which
unfortunately
is
not
in
the
record
does
say
text
to
statement
in
defense
of
communist
party,
but
if
your
honors
will
read
the
text
of
that
statement
and
see
who
the
signatories
are,
your
honor
will
see
that
it
was
a
1941
statement,
an
appeal
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
congress,
not
to
the
daily
worker
which
happen
to
reprint
it
as
they
had
a
right
to
do
i
assume,
and
that
wasn't
our
responsibility,
an
appeal
to
the
president
and
congress
against
the
possibility
of
the
communist
party
might
be
declared
illegal
and
against,
although
what
could
this
could
do
in
this
situation,
i
don't
know,
against
such
things
as
the
oklahoma
(inaudible)
which
as
your
honors
may
recall
was
being
applied
in
1940
to
various
members
of
the
communist
party.
this
appeal
is
a
most
rational,
honest
decent
appeal
that
anyone
could
--
could
read
as
witnessed
the
fact
that
is,
the
signatories
include
zechariah
chafee,
hocking,
just
was
admitted
to
the
academy
of
arts
and
letters,
one
of
a
series
of
great
honors,
professor
lehmann
of
the
union
theological
seminary,
francis
fisher
kane
of
philadelphia,
whom
your
honors
know,
the
great
lawyer.
these
are
the
kind
of
people.
it
is
very
likely
that
mr.
price
who
said
he
didn't
recall
having
signed
this,
never
signed
it
at
all
which
he
probably
ought
to
be
ashamed
because
the
william
price
here
is
the
william
price
of
swarthmore,
mr.
price
has
never
been
to
swarthmore,
but
this
accident
and
as
i
say
these
were
true
and
not
justifies
subpoena
and
with
one
of
the
three
things
that
led
to
this
man
against
whom
the
committee
had
no
information
being
subpoenaed.
now,
i
come
down
to
the
question
of
let's
assume
all
these,
however,
was
very
weighty
and
the
committee
did
have
this
information
and
there
might
have
been
some
evidence
as
to
a
curia,
although
mr.
price's
testimony
on
the
curia
issue
and
an
involvement
any
conspiracy
is
very
explicit
in
his
denial.
we
served
a
subpoena
on
the
government
for
the
purpose
of
producing
all
information
it
had
with
respect
to
this
young
woman
because
it
happened
that
she
had
testified
before
the
committee
and
completely
exculpated
herself
and
we
asked
for
all
information
with
respect
to
mr.
price.
as
i
said
before,
the
subpoena
was
quashed
and
when
mr.
rand
attempted
on
penetrations
to
get
information
from
mr.
sourwine
to
justify
what
he
had
said
on
his
direct
examination
to
justify
the
calling
of
mr.
price.
the
trial
court
upheld
his
refusal
to
answer
and
the
government
here
says,
“well,
the
trial
court
only
upheld
the
refusal
to
answer
ten
questions
as
if
the
number
of
questions
was
to
be
determined
over
the
constitutional
right
to
cross-examine
a
witness
with
respect
to
the
testimony
that
he
had
given
on
direct.
this
is
no
longer
a
first
amendment
problem.
this
is
a
right
--
is
a
normal
right
of
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
to
cross-examine
with
respect
to
what
has
been
adduced
on
direct.
the
trial
judge
merely
said
this
is
confidential
testimony
and
the
government
added
to
that
upon
this
appeal
a
new
argument
and
since
probable
cause
says
that
government
was
not
an
element
of
a
crime,
therefore
we
did
not
have
a
right
to
examine
it
because
it
was
only
an
element
of
the
right
to
call
the
witness.
now,
if
the
government
will
read
chief
judge
learned
hand's
opinion
in
andolschek
which
mr.
rand
referred
to
and
united
states
against
copeland,
the
government
will
see
that
whenever
the
government
has
the
information
bearing
upon
the
guilt,
innocence
or
the
right
to
prosecute
a
defendant
or
the
right
to
introduce
evidence
against
the
defendant
then
the
government
no
longer
has
the
right
of
confidence
with
respect
to
its
records
if
they
have
any
bearing
on
that
point.
and
judge
learned
hand
in
the
united
states
against
copeland
where
your
honors
denied
certiorari
which
did
not
involve
an
element
to
the
crime
but
the
question
of
whether
the
wiretap
--
the
records
of
the
government
--
wiretapping
records
had
led
to
the
arrest
of
the
defendant
in
that
case.
very
much
like
this
in
the
sense
sort
of
a
reasonable
cause
except
they're
involved
with
the
communications
act.
judge
learned
hand
said,
“it
is
however
one
thing
to
allow
the
privileged
person
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
toto
coelo,
another
thing
to
allow
him
to
fill
a
gap
in
his
own
evidence
by
recourse
to
what
he
suppresses.”
yes,
mr.
sourwine
was
--
was
stating
what
he
had
as
facts
and
would
not
allow
us
to
go
in
to
it
and
judge
learned
hand
said,
“the
prosecution
must
decide
whether
the
public
prejudice
of
allowing
the
crime
to
go
unpunished
was
greater
than
the
disclosure
of
such
“state
secrets,”
that
was
espionage
your
honors,
you'll
recall,
such
state
secrets
as
might
be
relevant
to
defense,
that
was
a
felony,
that
was
espionage,
this
is
a
misdemeanor.
and
finally,
judge
learned
hand
said
and
this
court
knows
this
language
i
am
sure,
“few
weapons
in
the
arsenal
of
freedom
are
more
useful
than
the
power
to
compel
a
government
to
disclose
the
evidence
on
which
it
seeks
to
forfeit
the
liberty
of
its
citizens.”
now,
we
come
last
in
the
next
two
minutes
to
the
question
of
luminosity.
did
we
ask
--
did
we
raise
the
issue
of
pertinency,
the
issue
of
right
of
the
committee
to
ask?
the
government
says,
“we
didn't
use
the
word
“pertinency.”
well,
i
submit
that
neither
did
mr.
watkins
as
your
honor
will
see
buried
in
his
statement
was
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
hasn't
--
see
how
these
things
are
relevant,
but
basically,
he
was
challenging
the
power
of
the
committee.
i'm
sure
this
court
did
not
mean
in
the
majority
opinion
written
by
the
chief
justice
to
lay
down
a
strict
rule
that
the
word
of
pertinency
must
be
used
otherwise
the
committee
has
no
duty
to
state
the
subject
matter
or
the
respects
in
which
the
matter
is
pertinent.
and
in
deutch,
there
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
dealt
with
a
very
narrow
thing,
a
man
came
forth
and
said,
“my
conscience
does
not
let
me
answer
the
information.”
he
didn't
challenge
the
power
of
the
committee.
we
challenged
the
power
of
the
committee
when
we
said
there
is
no
legislative
purpose
in
your
inquiry
committee,
so
to
intact
where
judge
youngdahl
acquitted
seymour
pat.
here,
we
rely
upon
what
the
chief
justice
said
in
quinn
against
united
states,
mr.
justice
harlan
concurring
in
that
aspect
of
the
court's
opinion
part
1
where
the
chief
justice
said,
involving
the
fifth
amendment,
“there
is
no
ritualistic
or
talismanic
formula
necessary
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment”
and
what
the
chief
justice
said
there
we
apply
here.
if
the
committee
was
in
any
doubt
as
to
subject
matter
--
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
witness'
objections
stated
in
five
different
ways,
“all
it
had
to
do”
as
the
chief
justice
said,
“was
to
ask
the
witness
whether
he
was
challenging
the
committee's
power,”
but
nobody
was
under
any
doubt
as
to
whether
the
witness
was
in
fact
challenging
the
committee
power.
your
honors
will
read
this
record.
your
honors
will
see
that
what
the
committee
was
concerned
about
was
one
thing.
“mr.
price,”
they
said,
“are
you
sure
you're
not
pleading
the
fifth
amendment?”
that
was
all
i
wanted
to
know.
they
didn't
care
whether
he
was
pleading
pertinency,
legislative
purpose,
committee
jurisdictional
power,
just
to
be
sure
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
being
involved
here.
i
don't
go
in
to
the
question
of
committee's
motivation
on
that
point.
i
merely
say
hereto
the
committee
was
very
able
to
see
that
there
was
a
direct
challenge
to
its
power
and
in
this
record
with
the
varied
number
of
subjects
covered
in
the
committee
hearing,
the
committee
had
to
tell
the
witness
what
the
subject
matter
was.
i
may
add
one
more
footnote,
what
i
have
said
is
a
dependence
upon
deutch,
the
dependence
upon
the
chief
justice's
opinion
even
if
narrowly
construed
in
watkins,
but
i
do
not
think
that
a
witness
whatever
maybe
his
duty
to
state
the
subject
matter
--
to
state
his
objections
to
--
on
pertinency
grounds
when
pertinency
is
a
problem
has
any
duty
before
a
congressional
committee
if
the
committee
is
silent
upon
the
principle
substratum
of
this
investigation
namely,
subject
matter.
when
the
committee
states
subject
matter,
the
witness
maybe
under
certain
circumstances,
i'm
not
prepared
to
--
can
see
all
cases
now
may
waive,
but
the
witness
can
never
waive
his
right
to
know
what
the
committee
is
investigating.
and
if
the
court
will
read
sometimes
again
as
it
must
occasionally
--
such
cases
as
sinclair,
the
court
will
see
that
in
sinclair
that
there
is
no
question
as
to
what
the
committee
was
investigating
in
detailed
discussion
that
it
had
with
counsel
who
appeared
and
was
permitted
to
talk
if
i
recall
him
there.
the
committee
indicated
subject
and
finally,
the
court
will
examine
the
indictment
in
sinclair.
it
will
see
a
22-page
indictment
in
detail,
explaining
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry.
i
don't
wonder
that
in
this
case
those
subject
matters
of
inquiry
were
indicated
in
the
indictment
because
none
was
stated
in
the
committee
hearing.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
judge
keech,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
before
going
back
to
the
questions
put
to
my
friend
mr.
doolittle
on
which
my
answers
might
differ
as
to
the
facts.
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
constitutional
issue
to
my
brief.
i
do
want
to
say
that
we
do
challenge
the
power
of
the
committee
to
investigate
the
press
and
we
think
that
both
judge
youngdahl,
speaking
for
the
judiciary
and
mr.
walter
lippman
speaking
for
the
press,
put
their
finger
on
the
real
problem
because
mr.
lippman
pointed
out
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
this
appears
at
page
40
of
my
brief
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
he
was
not
a
witness.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
this
is
just
an
observation
by
a
well-known
public
commentator
which
i
think
is
sound
to
some
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
committee
without
factual
support.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
understand
that
but
i'm
--
i'm
here
to
be
cross-examined.
i
am
stating
mr.
lippman's
view.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
will
adopt
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
will
state
them
as
my
own.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
will
then
adopt
them
as
my
own
avowing
to
his
knowledge
when
i
say
he
said,
“in
what
form
of
generation
had
ever
before
in
our
history
has
the
government
claimed
the
power
to
examine
and
pass
judgment
upon
who
shall
work
on
newspapers.”
now,
when
senator
hennings
of
whom
i
--
i
am
a
great
admirer
was
the
late
senator
hennings
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
was
always
a
great
admirer
and
he
was--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
regret
to
say.
when
senator
hennings
tried
to
separate
himself
a
little
bit
from
this
subcommittee
upon
which
he
found
himself,
i
think
for
the
first
time
of
his
life,
the
internal
security
subcommittee,
he
having
devoted
himself
to
the
protection
of
civil
liberties
on
another
subcommittee,
this
judiciary
committee
when
he
said
this
is
not
an
effort.
this
is
not
an
attack
upon
any
one
newspaper,
but
an
effort
on
the
part
of
this
committee
to
show
an
attempt
--
i'm
leaving
out
a
few
words,
in
the
communist
party,
the
influence
or
to
subvert
the
american
press.
now,
i
suggest
your
honors
that
the
remark
was
made
that
an
investigation
of
the
press
is
proper
in
order
to
protect
it.
it's
exactly
the
thing
that
will
undermine
a
free
press
and
whenever
the
government
moves
in,
whether
in
this
country
or
the
soviet
union
or
in
nazi
germany
or
elsewhere
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
the
press
shall
say
or
who
shall
work
on
it,
it
is
subverting
what
we
understand
in
this
country
to
be
freedom
of
the
press.
and
it
may
look
better
when
it
happens
to
the
united
states
and
the
senate
committee
uses
these
words,
“but
it
is
no
better
no
matter
what
country
under
which
it
is
done.”
now,
i
turn
to
the
second
point
in
the
last
couple
of
minutes
and
say
to
your
honor's
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
no
information
was
given
to
mr.
price
when
he
appeared
before
the
committee
as
to
charges
against
him,
questions
were
put
but
he
was
not
told.
i
think
i'm
fair
in
my
reading
of
the
record.
we
have
information
that
x
was
a
communist
courier
and
went
with
you
on
this
trip.
secondly,
when
mr.
price
--
when
mr.
sourwine
appeared
at
the
trial,
mr.
sourwine
never
claimed
that
any
such
information
had
been
given
to
mr.
price.
i
want
also
to
indicate
your
honors
that
we
do
not
see
how
this
whole
series
of
cases
like
grosjean
and
rumely
and
hannegan
are
consistent
with
what
was
done
in
the
present
situation.
and
the
time
is
too
short
for
me
to
analyze
the
argument
but
we
refer
your
--
your
honors
to
our
briefs
on
this
point
on
the
first
amendment.
thank
you
your
honors.
