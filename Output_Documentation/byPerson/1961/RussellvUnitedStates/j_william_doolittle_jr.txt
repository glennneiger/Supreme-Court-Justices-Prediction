mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
is
arguing
two
points
in
this
oral
argument
today.
he
has
only
adverted
to
one.
i
hope
to
be
able
to
cover
it
so
that
it
won't
be
covered
solely
in
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
justice,
it
is
in,
again,
in
this
blue
volume.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
and
it's
at
pages
1
through
3,
but
it's
after
the
pink
divider.
you
see,
the
first
part
of
that
volume
is
the
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it's
after
the
pink
divider.
then,
the
numbering
starts
again
and
it's
at
page
1.
now,
the
two
basic
questions
that
are
raised
and
that
i
do
hope
to
be
able
to
cover
in
the
time
available
are,
first,
the
basis
for
the
committee's
--
subcommittee's
calling
the
petitioner
and,
second,
the
extent
to
which
a
subject
under
inquiry
and
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
to
that
subject
were
adequately
established
and
proved.
now,
the
question
of
the
basis
for
calling
the
petitioner
has
been
raised
here
in
the
context
of
the
trial
court's
limitation
on
the
right
of
petitioner's
counsel
to
cross-examine
concerning
the
identity
of
confidential
informants.
now,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
realize
the
context
in
which
that
particular
question
first
arose
in
this
case
originally
at
the
trial,
and
i
might
say
that
there
was
no
question
of
the
committee's
basis
for
calling
petitioner
raised
at
the
hearing,
at
trial,
the
only
question
that
was
raised
with
respect
to
acquiring
this
information
on
which
the
committee
based
its
calling
of
petitioner
was
petitioner's
contention
that
the
committee
already
had
all
of
the
information
that
it
sought
to
obtain.
in
other
words,
that
its
calling
of
petitioner
was
a
vain
act,
not
that
the
subcommittee
didn't
have
any
basis
for
calling
him.
quite
the
contrary,
that
it
had
all
of
this
basis
and
didn't
really
need
to
know
anything
else.
now,
we
argued
in
our
brief
and
we
do
contend
that
this
would
be
no
defense
since
the
subcommittee
does
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
confirming
its
information
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
informants
that
have
given
it
this
information
are
reliable
and
in
establishing
a
foundation
for
asking
further
questions.
however,
after
the
trial
level,
the
petitioner
is
now
raising
this
question
as
to
the
basis
for
the
subcommittee's
calling
petitioner.
we
point
out,
first,
of
course,
that
this
is,
we
submit,
fatally
inconsistent
with
his
prior
contention
that
the
subcommittee
already
had
all
of
the
information
that
it
sought
answers
on,
and
i
might
say
that's
at
page
128
of
the
joint
appendix
where
that
statement
appears
in
the
trial
record.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
the
conviction
was
on
14
out
of
15
counts,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
15
was
the
one
that
was
not.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that's
right.
the
district
court
did
not
convict
him
on
it.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
actually,
the
district
court
dismissed
that.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
sir.
neither
at
the
hearing
or
at
the
trial
did
petitioner
rebut
what
the
government
contends
is
the
presumption
of
regularity
in
the
subcommittee's
having
called
petitioner
and,
thus,
we
submit
the
issue
of
the
basis
for
the
subcommittee's
calling
petitioner
just
was
not
brought
into
the
case.
however,
it
is
plain
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
petitioner
was
not
called
as
a
result
of
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures,
to
use
the
language
of
barenblatt.
subcommittee
counsel,
at
the
trial,
gave
sworn
testimony
concerning
the
information
that
provided
the
basis
for
the
subcommittee's
calling
petitioner.
we've
set
forth
that
information
at
pages
4
and
5
of
our
brief,
summarizing
what
was
testified
to
a
trial.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
we've
summarized,
your
honor.
i
think
you'll
find
the
references
are
fairly
complete
to
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
was--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
was
about
to
point
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
substantially
all,
and
i
believe
all,
of
this
information
was
in
fact
actually
discussed
in
the
hearing
before
the
various
questions
were
asked.
this
--
in
this
hearing
before
series
of
questions,
either
the
chairman
or
the
chief
counsel
would
state
what
information
the
subcommittee
had
and
then
it
would
proceed
to
ask
the
petitioner
the
questions
but
i
think,
in
specific
answer
to
your
question,
the
information
that
did
come
out
at
trial
was
not,
in
any
significant
way,
different
from
the
information
that
obviously
formed
the
basis
of
the
various
questions
that
petitioner
was
asked
at
the
time.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
if
i
could
have
one
point
of
clarification,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
you
say
not
before
the
committee,
do
you
mean
not
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
not
--
not
disclosed
in
the
hearings?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
it
is
our
contention,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
subcommittee
does
not
have
any
obligation
to
disclose
the
information
at
the
hearings,
and
our
position
is
that
the
first
time
there
comes
any
burden
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
taken
as
a
whole,
congress
and
the
executive
branch,
to
make
any
disclosure
on
this
point
is
when,
if
it
does
take
place
at
trial,
a
strong
and
substantial
showing
is
made
by
the
defense
that
there
was
no
basis
whatsoever.
then,
the
government
must
make
at
least
a
prima
facie
showing
that
the
committee
did
have
some
basis.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
it
would
depend
on
--
presumably,
i
mean
--
i'd
say,
technically,
it
would
be
rebuttal
because
as
we
say
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
again,
you're
talking
about
testimony
that
was
not
brought
out
at
the
hearings.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
we
can
certainly
contend
that
the
government
can
do
so
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
if
it's--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
if
the
inquiry
is
made
with
what
was
the
basis
and,
as
i
say,
a
strong
showing
is
made
that
there
was
no
basis,
then,
as
we
say,
the
government
certainly
may
disclose
to
a
reasonable
extent
the
basis
that
there
was.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i'm
afraid
i
don't
quite
understand
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
it's
quite
possible,
of
course,
that
the
case
in
chief
will
establish
so
clearly
that
their
--
that
the
committee
had
an
actual
basis
that,
perhaps,
the
petitioner
won't
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
--
be
able
to
make
any
showing,
but
there
are
any
number
of
facts,
for
example,
a
conclusive
--
an
absolutely
conclusive
demonstration
that
the
information
that
they
were
talking
about
involved
some
other
person,
then
it
couldn't
have
involved
petitioner.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
argue
that
the
first
point
that
petitioner
has
raised
in
that
concerns
the
committee's
basis
for
calling
the
petitioner.
after
subcommittee
counsel
had
testified
to
the
effect
that
i
have
referred
to
and
as
set
forth
on
pages
4
and
5
of
our
brief,
he
submitted
to
cross-examination
on
a
number
of
aspects
of
that
information
such
as,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
the
reliability
of
the
informants
and
the
form
in
which
the
information
was
received,
that
is
to
say,
whether
it
was
oral
or
written,
circumstances
in
which
it
was
received,
and
so
on.
and,
it
did
appear
from
the
record,
there's
no
indication
to
the
contrary,
that
the
court
would've
allowed
further
questioning
along
these
general
lines.
the
line
was
drawn
at
compromising
confidential
informants.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
types
of
information
that
were
brought
out
in
this
case
and
the
form
in
which
the
information
was
brought
out
in
this
case
is
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
barenblatt
case,
that
is
to
say,
it
is
the
same
type
of
information,
the
same
form
that
the
court
relied
on
to
rebut
the
proposition
that
the
witness
was
called
as
a
result
of
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures.
now,
in
this
case,
as
in
so
many
of
these
cases,
the
contention
is
again
raised
that
the
subject
under
inquiry
by
the
subcommittee
when
the
petitioner
appeared
was
not
sufficiently
set
forth
at
that
time
and
was
not
proved
by
the
government
at
trial.
and,
here
again,
it
is
not
so
much
contended
that
there
were
no
indications
of
subject
matter
but,
rather,
there
were
too
many
such
indications
and
that
they
were
inconsistent
with
one
another.
i
think
it
is
very
appropriate
in
these
circumstances
to
consider
briefly
why
it
is
important
to
identify
a
subject
under
inquiry,
and
also,
to
consider
the
character
that
a
subject
under
inquiry
may
assume.
of
course
the
primary
reasons
for
identification
of
a
subject
under
inquiry
by
an
investigating
committee
are
essentially
practical.
a
witness,
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
answer
each
question,
needs
to
know
the
subject
under
inquiry
at
that
time
so
that
he
can
reach
a
judgment,
on
the
one
hand,
as
to
whether
that
subject
is
within
the
committee's
general
investigating
authority
and,
on
the
other,
as
to
whether
the
particular
question
that
he's
trying
to
decide
whether
to
answer
or
not
is
pertinent
to
that
subject
matter.
what
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
the
proper
focus
for
this
must
necessarily
have
been
the
witness'
focus
is
upon
the
relationship
that
each
question
bears
to
what
the
subject
under
inquiry
was,
at
the
time
of
the
question
was
asked,
and
what
the
witness
understood
it
to
be
at
that
time.
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
subjects
under
inquiry
by
a
subcommittee
with
investigatory
authority
as
extensive,
and
yet,
as
interrelated
as
that
of
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee
are
bound
to
develop
essentially
in
layers.
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
internal
security
subcommittee
of
the
senate
had
been
engaged
for
a
number
of
years
in
one
basic
investigation
with
a
single
central
theme,
and
that
is
the
investigation
of
com
--
of
the
communist
organization
and
activities
in
the
united
states.
and,
in
a
very
real
sense,
that
is
always
a
subject
under
inquiry,
against
which
the
subcommittee's
questions
may
be
properly
judged.
however,
as
much
for
convenience
and
efficiency
as
for
any
other
reason,
the
subcommittee
will
often
conduct
hearings
focused
upon
a
narrower
aspect
of
that
basic
subject,
a
lesser
included
subject
under
inquiry,
so
to
speak.
a
good
example
of
this
is
the
three-day
set
of
hearings
that
the
subcommittee
held
on
communist
infiltration
into
news
media
which
is
involved
in
the
shelton,
whitman,
and
price
cases.
not
infrequently,
however,
the
breakdown
within
the
basic
subject
under
inquiry
will
coincide
not
with
a
group
of
witnesses
in
one
trade
or
profession
but
with
a
single
witness,
thus,
in
the
present
case.
the
subcommittee
was
pursuing
as
a
part
of
its
basic
subject
under
inquiry,
which
was
communist
organization
and
activities
in
the
united
states,
generally.
the
more
specific
subject
on
which
it
had
reason
to
believe
that
petitioner
had
information
was
recent
revisions
in
communist
organization
and
communist
activities
in
the
south.
and,
finally,
the
subject
under
inquiry
may
be,
and
often
is,
narrowed
down
even
more
for
the
purposes
of
asking
a
specific
single
question.
the
present
case
provides
an
excellent
example
of
that.
prior
to
asking
the
petitioner
whether
he
had
contributed
funds
to
the
communist
party,
the
chairman
informed
him
that
the
subcommittee
wish
to
know
how
the
party
was
financed,
thus,
establishing
a
subject
under
inquiry
for
that
one
particular
question.
and,
this
illustrates
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
the
subject
under
inquiry
often
manifests
itself
in
layers.
when
this
last
question
was
asked,
the
basic
subject
under
inquiry
was
communist
activities
generally,
within
which,
the
witness
was
being
questioned
on
the
narrower
subject
of
organizational
revisions
and
activities
in
the
south.
and
then,
for
the
purpose
of
this
one
question,
the
subject
was
expressly
narrowed
to
party
finances.
now,
it
is,
of
course,
this
stratification
of
greater
and
lesser
included
subjects
under
inquiry
that
explain
some
of
the
statements
by
the
prosecutor
and
by
subcommittee
counsel
at
trial,
suggesting
a
broad
subject
of
inquiry
in
terms
of
communist
activities
generally.
those
statements,
however,
were
in
no
way
inconsistent
with,
nor
did
they
in
any
way
change
what
the
government's
evidence
showed,
the
subject
under
inquiry
to
have
been
and
what
the
petitioner
understood
it
to
be.
now,
i
should
like,
very
briefly,
to
review
the
evidence
that
did
establish
what
the
subject
under
inquiry
was
in
the
present
case.
on
march
19,
1956,
the
petitioner
appeared
before
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee
very
briefly
in
executive
session
but,
upon
his
refusal
to
answer
to
questions
concerning
communist
associations,
he
was
temporarily
excused.
shortly
thereafter,
on
the
same
day,
he
was
called
before
the
subcommittee
in
open
session.
before
he
was
asked
any
questions,
subcommittee
counsel
read
a
statement
by
the
chairman
setting
forth
the
purposes
of
the
hearing
and
the
critical
portion
of
that
statement
was
this
paragraph.
“we
shall
try
to
determine
to
what
extent
soviet
power
operates
through
the
communist
party
here
and
to
what
extent
other
organizations
have
been
devised
to
effectuate
its
purposes.
we
shall
study
the
structural
revisions
that
the
communists
have
made
in
their
network
in
order
to
avoid
detection,
and
endeavor
to
trace
the
movement
of
individual
agents
through
these
changing
structures.”
petitioner
was
then
asked,
and
answered,
a
number
of
questions
about
his
current
employment
in
new
orleans
and
about
his
previous
employment
in
new
york
and
elsewhere.
then,
subcommittee
counsel,
after
stating
that
the
committee
had
information
that
petitioner
and
his
wife
had
been
instructed
by
the
communist
party
to
avoid
formal
party
associations
when
they
went
south,
made
this
statement.
“the
purpose
of
subpoenaing
this
witness
and
asking
him
the
following
questions
is
to
determine
to
what
extent
mr.
liveright's
activities
have
been
carried
out
in
new
orleans
in
the
framework
of
a
communist
party
and
to
what
extent
they
have
been
carried
out
in
some
other
framework.”
petitioner
was
then
asked
and
refused
to
answer
questions
as
to
whether
he
was
then
a
communist
or
whether
he
had
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
and
these
refusals
form
the
basis
for
counts
three
and
four.
then,
the
chairman,
after
noting
that
we
are
tracing
the
activities
of
the
communist
party
in
united
states,
made
this
statement.
“our
information
is,
sir,
that
you
are
sent
south
and
placed
there
with
your
wife
on
a
mission
for
the
communist
party
and
were
told
by
your
superiors
not
to
become
involved
with
the
communist
cell
that
was
a
professional
group
in
the
city
of
new
orleans,
but
the
word
was
used
by
your
superiors
to
stay
clean.”
the
chairman
then
asked
petitioner
the
questions
that
form
the
basis
for
counts
five
through
seven,
whether
he
was
sent
on
a
mission
for
the
party
into
the
south,
whether
he
had
affiliated
with
the
communist
cell
in
new
orleans
composed
of
professional
people,
and
whether
communist
meetings
had
been
held
in
his
home
in
new
orleans.
then,
after
petitioner
was
asked
and
refused
to
answer
question
about
being
membership
director
of
a
named
unit
in
the
communist
party,
the
chairman
stated
that
the
subcommittee
desired
to
know
how
the
communist
conspiracy
was
financed
and
that
it
had
information
that
petitioner
had
given
money
to
the
communist
party
on
various
occasions.
petitioner
refused
to
state
whether
this
was
true,
and
this
refusal
forms
the
basis
for
count
9.
then,
petitioner
was
asked
the
questions
on
which
counts
10
through
14
are
based.
this
concerned
mainly
certain
activities
in
new
york,
the
holding
of
communist
meetings
in
his
home
in
new
orleans,
when
he
joined
the
communist
party,
and
whether
he
had
been
told
by
the
communist
leadership
to
stay
clean
in
new
orleans.
thus,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
and
that's
at
page
8
of
the
record,
not
only
was
the
subject
under
inquiry
spelled
out
at
the
beginning
of
the
open
session
to
be
“structural
revisions
that
the
communists
have
made
in
their
network
to
avoid
detection
and
the
movement
of
individual
agents
through
these
changing
structures,”
but
it
was
further
refined
by
a
specific
statement
that
the
subcommittee
wish
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
petitioner
had
been
sent
south
to
carry
out
communist
activities
on
an
undercover
basis.
and
then,
each
of
several
series
of
questions
was
preceded
by
a
careful
explanation
of
the
way
in
which
the
questions
were
pertinent
to
the
announced
subject
under
inquiry,
although
most
of
them
were
pertinent
on
their
face
and
these
matters,
of
course,
were
established
at
trial
by
the
government's
introduction
of
the
transcript
into
the
record.
now,
since
petitioner
did
not
raise
the
subject
of
the
subject
under
inquiry
or
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
asked,
we
contend
that
it
is
not
open
to
him
to
contend
that
he
was
not
up
apprised
of
these
matters.
his
objection,
which
was
a
lengthy
legal
statement
comparable
to
that
involved
in
the
barenblatt
case,
expressed
only
his
objection
to
being
questioned
on
his
political
beliefs
and
his
associational
activities.
the
only
mention
of
pertinency,
like
in
barenblatt,
was
that
he
might
wish
to
challenge
the
pertinency
of
the
question
of
the
investigation,
and
that's
a
type
of
objection
that
was
expressly
held
in
barenblatt
to
be
ineffective
to
raise
a
pertinency
objection.
furthermore,
however,
it
is
plain
that
the
petitioner
was
aware
of
the
subject
under
inquiry
and
of
the
pertinency
of
the
subject's
--
of
the
questions
to
that
subject.
prior
to
his
appearance
at
these
hearings,
his
counsel
called
the
subcommittee
counsel
who
informed
him
in
general
terms
as
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry,
and
counsel
indicated
that
he
understood.
the
same
counsel
represented
petitioner
at
the
hearings
themselves.
he
did
not
indicate
that
there
was
any
variance
between
the
subject
disclosed
to
him
in
advance
and
that
actually
inquired
into
by
the
subcommittee.
petitioner,
of
course,
heard
the
repeated
explanatory
statements
at
the
hearings
by
the
chairman
and
by
subcommittee
counsel.
and,
we
submit
that
there
cannot
possibly
have
been
any
question
in
his
mind
as
to
what
was
being
inquired
into
and
how
the
questions
were
in
fact
pertinent.
counsel,
in
his
brief,
has
also
raised
several
other
questions
and
i
should
like
to
deal
with
as
many
of
them
as
i
can
within
the
time
available
to
me
and,
as
to
the
remainder,
we
will
of
course
rely
on
our
brief.
the
first
of
these
contentions
is
that
the
senate
resolution,
under
which
this
subcommittee
was
operating,
was
unduly
vague.
now,
the
authority
of
this
subcommittee
to
act
arose
out
of
senate
resolution
366
of
the
eighty-first
congress,
and
that's
set
forth
in
the
petitioner's
brief
in
this
case
at
pages
50
and
51.
actually,
there's
a
paragraph
or
two
that
is
not
included
there,
but
i'll
refer
to
that
a
little
later.
in
each
subsequent
session,
that
basic
resolution
has
been
readopted
and,
in
this
case,
the
senate
resolution
that
readopted
the
one
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
hearings
was
senate
resolution
174
of
the
eighty-fourth
congress.
now,
as
a
whole,
we
submit
that
this
resolution,
senate
resolution
366,
and
the
precise
terms
are
repeated
in
174,
that
their
terms
are
very
much
clearer
than
the
house
un-american
activities
committee
charter
which
was
considered
in
both
the
watkins
and
the
barenblatt
cases.
and,
the
rule
11
of
the
house
which
was
involved
in
those
cases
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
this
case
on
page
21.
but,
specifically,
this
--
senate
resolution
366
and
174
specifically
authorize
an
investigation
into
“infiltration
by
persons
who
are
or
may
be
under
the
domination
of
the
foreign
government
or
organizations
controlling
the
world
communist
movement
or
any
other
movement
seeking
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence.”
and,
we
submit
that
that
is
a
very
clear
and
specific
authorization
for
the
conduct
of
this
particular
investigation.
however,
that
should
not
be
thought
to
be
the
case.
like
house
rule
11,
this
resolution
--
series
of
resolutions,
indeed,
comes
to
us
with
a
persuasive
gloss
of
legislative
history
that
shows
that
the
senate
did
authorize
investigations
of
communist
activities
in
this
country
like
the
ones
that
are
involved
in
these
cases.
to
use
the
same
factors
that
the
court
cited
in
the
barenblatt
case
in
discussing
the
legislative
gloss
of
house
rule
11,
first,
this
subcommittee
has
devoted
most
of
its
energies
to
investigating
communist
activities
in
various
phases
of
american
life,
and
those
hearings
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
this
case
at
pages
26
and
27.
the
senate
has
repeatedly
continued
the
life
of
the
subcommittee
at
each
congress,
and
the
resolutions
that
do
that
are
set
forth
in
pages
27
and
28
of
our
brief.
the
senate
has
never
narrowed
the
authority
of
the
subcommittee
and
the
senate
has
continually
supported
it
with
substantial
appropriations
and
those
by
the
same
resolutions
that
i
have
referred
to,
cited
in
our
brief.
now,
the
contention
is
also
made
that
this
subcommittee
could
not
act,
at
the
time
that
it
was
questioning
petitioner,
because
the
senate
was
in
session.
section
134
(c)
of
the
legislative
reorganization
act
provides
that
committees
shall
not
sit
while
the
senate
is
in
session
without
special
leave.
now,
we
contend,
first,
that
this
claim
is
not
open
to
the
petitioner
because
he
did
not
object
at
the
hearing
when,
if
something
was
to
be
done
about
this,
it
could've
been
done.
he
did
not
inquire
as
to
whether
this
problem
was
present,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
not
now
open
to
him
to
raise
the
objection.
however,
we
submit,
too,
that
in
any
event,
section
134
(c)
is
a
procedural
limitation
for
the
benefit
of
congress
alone
in
order
to
secure
attendance
at
its
various
sessions
and
that,
in
any
event,
it
was
not
intended
to
confer
any
rights
upon
witnesses.
finally,
section
2
of
senate
resolution
366,
which
is
set
forth
at
page
3
of
our
brief
in
this
case,
expressly
gave
the
subcommittee
authority
to
sit
and
act
at
such
places
and
times
during
the
sessions,
recesses,
and
adjourned
periods
of
the
senate
as
it
deemed
advisable.
thirdly,
the
contention
on
the
subject
of
the
authority
of
the
subcommittee
is
raised
that
counts
one
and
two
are
invalid
because
the
executive
session
at
which
they
were
asked
was
not
authorized.
section
133
of
the
legislative
reorganization
act
requires
that
there'd
be
a
majority
vote
of
a
subcommittee
to
authorize
executive
sessions,
and
it
is
to
that
provision
that
petitioner
is
referring.
here,
again,
we
contend
that
this
point
is
not
open
to
the
petitioner
because
he
did
not
raise
it
at
the
hearings
when
it
could've
been
corrected.
however,
we
do
submit
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
resolve
this
question
one
way
or
the
other
since
it
does
affect
only
2
of
the
14
counts.
on
the
basis
of
which,
petitioner
was
convicted
since
he
was
given
a
general
sentence
that
is
less
than
he
could've
received
on
any
one
count.
his
sentence
must
be
confirmed
if
any
one
count
is
valid.
next,
i
should
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
point
of
government
employees
being
on
the
grand
and
petit
juries.
government
counsel
in
the
russell
case
has
stated
the
government's
basic
position.
that
is,
that
in
order
to
challenge
an
indictment
on
this
ground,
there
must
be
an
allegation
of
specific
and
convincing
evidence
of
strong
bias
on
the
part
of
individual
grand
jurors.
now,
the
affidavit,
on
the
basis
of
which
petitioner
did
make
the
challenge
that
he
made,
does
not,
unfortunately,
appear
on
the
record
here.
however,
it
is
substantially
similar
to
that
in
the
shelton
case,
and
that
appears
on
pages
4
to
8
of
the
shelton
record,
except
that
it
does
not
contain
the
last
two
paragraphs
of
the
shelton
affidavit
which
alleges
personal
knowledge
on
the
part
of
counsel
in
the
shelton
case.
but,
the
court,
i
think,
may
take
the
shelton
affidavit
as
being
substantially
what
was
involved
in
this
case.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
that
affidavit
was
far
too
general.
it
did
not
allege
specific
and
convincing
or
any
other
kind
of
evidence
biased
on
the
part
of
individual
grand
jurors,
nor
did
it
even
state
any
specific
evidence
of
fear
or
intimidation
on
the
part
of
government
employees
generally.
now,
we
contend
of
course
that
the
same
considerations
are
applicable
to
the
petit
jury
but,
of
course,
it
is
important
to
realize
that,
with
respect
to
a
petit
jury,
and
there
was
a
jury
involved
in
this
case,
that
voir
dire
is
available.
in
this
case,
there
was
and
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
there
was
a
jury
in
this
case,
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
was
a
petit
jury
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
there
was
a
petit
jury
in
this
case
and
counsel
did
participate
in
the
voir
dire,
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so.
well,
i
just
don't
know
about
that.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
hearing
was
requested.
yes,
certainly,
a
hearing
was
requested.
i
didn't
understand
your
question
to
go
to
that
point.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
this
of
course
was
afterwards.
that's
why
i
didn't
understand
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
it
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
grand
jury?
no,
sir,
there
was
no
such
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no.
the
application
was
made
actually
at
roughly
the
time
of
trial
to
have
a
hearing
in
which
the
grand
jurors
would
be
brought
in
for
questioning
as
to
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
i
don't
suppose
it
really
would.
i
don't
suppose
that
it
would.
now,
in
this
case,
in
the
case
of
the
petit
jury,
an
extensive
voir
dire
examination
was
in
fact
conducted
as
to
whether
nature
of
the
charges
involving,
as
they
did,
communism
and
questions
relating
to
communism,
or
the
government
employees
--
the
government
employment
of
some
of
the
jurors
might
affect
their
decision.
petitioner's
counsel
asked
some
13
questions
along
this
line,
those
are
86
to
94
of
the
transcript.
the
court,
itself,
asked
six
more
relating
to
this
very
point
and
those
are
set
forth
at
pages
95
to
96
of
the
transcript.
the
court
then
actually
dismissed
to
jurors
on
related
grounds,
first,
an
employee
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
and,
secondly,
a
woman
who
was
an
officer
of
an
organization
that
had
conducted
a
study
of
the
security
program.
petitioner
also
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
indictment
was
sufficient
in
this
case.
now,
the
sub
--
first
he
raises
this
question
with
respect
to
the
allegations
on
the
subject
under
inquiry
and
the
pertinency
of
the
questions.
the
indictment
did
allege
that
the
questions
were
pertinent
to
the
subject
then
under
inquiry.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
surely,
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
that's
right.
the
challenge
was
raised
on
the
same
basis
for
both.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
well,
the
charge
--
the
complaint
as
to
both
is
that
there
were
government
employees.
there
was
a
general
motion
to
disqualify
for
a
cause
made
with
respect
to
the
petit
jury.
petitioner
did
move
at
trial
to
have
all
government
employees
disqualified
from
the
petit
jury
on
the
ground
that
they
were
government
employees.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
page
10
of
the
joint
appendix,
mr.
justice.
now,
as
government
counsel
argued
in
the
russell
case,
no
court
has
ever
indicated
that
such
detail
as
the
petitioner
would
ask
for
here
is
required
in
indictments
in
cases
of
this
type
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
repeatedly
held
to
the
contrary.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
insistence
upon
specifically
stating
subject
under
inquiry
and
the
pertinency
of
each
question
to
that
subject
under
inquiry
would
be
inconsistent
with
rule
7
(c)
which
calls
for
a
plain,
concise,
and
definite
written
statement
of
the
essential
facts
constituting
the
offense
charged.
we
point
out,
for
one
thing,
that
there
was
no
bill
of
particulars
in
this
case
indicating
that
there
was
any
confusion
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
at
trial.
we
also
point
out
that
indictments
substantially
the
same,
exactly
the
same,
on
this
point
were
involved
in
barenblatt,
deutch,
and
wilkinson
and
that
the
question
was
not,
at
least,
sufficiently
obvious
for
counsel
in
those
cases
to
raise
or
for
the
court
to
rule
upon.
secondly,
the
question
is
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
the
authority
of
the
subcommittee
had
to
be
more
spelled
out
in
more
detail
than
it
was
in
the
indictment
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
the
authority
of
the
subcommittee
was
set
out
in
sufficient
detail,
and
here
is
the
detail
in
the
indictment.
pursuant
to
the
legislative
reorganization
act
of
1946,
section
102
(1)(k),
60
stat.
818,
and
the
senate
resolutions
366
of
the
eighty-first
congress
and
174
of
the
eighty-fourth
congress,
and
to
the
standing
rules
of
the
senate.
and,
incidentally,
the
standing
rules
of
the
senate
are
relevant
because
they
give
the
authority
of
the
judiciary
--
the
basic
authority
of
judiciary
committee
as
a
standing
committee.
we
submit
that
nothing
more
than
this
could
reasonably
be
required
in
an
indictment
that
must
have
a
plain,
concise,
and
definite
written
statement
of
the
essential
facts
constituting
the
offense
charged.
i
see
that
my
time
has
run
out.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
claim
has
not
been
raised.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle,
jr.
yes,
sir.
