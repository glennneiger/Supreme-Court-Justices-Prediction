number
31,
gwendolyn
hoyt,
appellant,
versus
florida.
mr.
ehrmann.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
suppose
you
can
say
either
that
women
are
less
active
in
political
life
than
men,
would
you
mr.
ehrmann?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
ehrmann.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
georgieff.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
defendant
there
a
woman?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
--
i
wonder
if
that
wouldn't
be
capable
of
other
--
another
kind
of
solution
there,
not
everyone
has
small
children
that
she
has
to
raise.
there
are
great
many
of
them
that
have
none,
a
great
many
of
them
that
are
married,
there
are
great
many
of
them
whose
children
have
become
matured
and
i
wonder
if
they
couldn't
--
who
are
better
have
a
statute
that
would
exempt
them
if
they
had
home
duties
of
that
kind
just
as
we
exempt
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
or
a
minister
of
the
gospel
and
so
forth.
but
i
don't
think
we
can
start
can
we
with
any
premise
that
all
woman
should
be
disqualified
because
a
great
many
of
them
are
the
mothers
of
our
children.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
you
speak
of
infirmities,
fundamental
infirmities
for
this
service,
do
you
mean
anything
except
that
women
are
homemakers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
you
think
for
a
series
of
--
through
a
series
of
years
that
they
have
10
every
year
and
no
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
doesn't
the
fact
that
you
always
have
10
show
some
kind
of
a
system
whether
it's
systematic
exclusion
or
whatever
it
is,
if
you
always
have
10
in
the
box
over
a
period
of
years,
isn't
that
some
kind
of
a
system?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
explained
a
moment
ago
that
the
reason
they
didn't
do
it
was
because
if
they
put
more
of
them
in,
they'd
soon
run
out
of
names
entirely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
justice
frankfurter
asked
you
why
didn't
--
if
--
when
you
have
so
few
women,
why
didn't
you
put
in
all
the
women
and
i
thought
a
little
while
ago
you
said,
if
we
kept
putting
in
more
and
more,
the
first
thing
you
know,
we
would
--
there
wouldn't
be
any
women
on
the
list.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
women.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
are
in
the
panel?
how
many
are
on
the
panel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
you
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
at
least
there
is
always
at
least
one
woman
on
a
panel
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
by
panel,
how
large
a
group
do
you
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
by
panel,
do
you
mean
the
jury
itself
on
the
trial
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
by
panel
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
what
you
meant
those
from
which
the
trial
jury
was
selected?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
county
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
--
well,
what's
the
principal
city
in
that
county?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
large
a
county
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
about
400,000
people
in
that
county.
