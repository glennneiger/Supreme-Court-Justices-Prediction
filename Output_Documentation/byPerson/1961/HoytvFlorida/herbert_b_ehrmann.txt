mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
may
it
please
the
court.
so
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the
first
case
before
this
court
involving
the
issue
as
to
whether
a
woman
may
be
tried
by
an
all-male
jury
and
convicted
under
a
statute
which
virtually
excludes
women
and
an
administration
of
the
statute
which
almost
makes
certain
that
there
will
be
no
women.
we
meet
that
issue
frontally
in
this
case.
gwendolyn
hoyt
was
tried
on
information
in
the
superior
court
or
in
the
court
of
criminal
record
of
hillsborough
county,
florida.
she
was
charged
with
killing
her
husband
and
the
information
stated
that
she
was
to
be
tried
for
second
degree
murder.
a
second
degree
murder
in
the
state
of
florida
is
defined
as
follows:
“when
perpetrated
by
an
act
imminently
dangerous
to
another
and
evincing
a
depraved
mind,
regardless
of
human
life,
although
without
any
premeditated
design
to
effect
the
death
of
any
particular
individual,
it
shall
be
murder
in
a
second
degree
and
shall
be
punished
by
imprisonment
in
the
state
of
prison
for
life
or
for
any
number
of
years
not
less
than
20
years.”
in
other
words,
the
distinction
of
a
second
degree
murder
from
manslaughter
was
a
state
of
mind.
mrs.
hoyt
pleaded
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
temporary
insanity.
the
jury
could
have
found
her
not
guilty,
could
have
found
her
guilty
of
manslaughter
or
could
have
found
that
she
was
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
having
a
depraved
mind.
florida
counsel
who
tried
the
case,
and
by
the
way
he
is
the
courtroom
today,
challenged
the
jury
panel
of
approximately
60
male
jurors
with
a
motion
to
quash.
he
challenged
it
on
two
grounds.
first,
that
the
statute
under
which
the
jury
was
selected
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
due
process.
and
that
the
method
of
administering
the
statute
by
the
jury
commissioners
was
also
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
due
process.
florida
is
one
three
states
which
has
a
jury
chosen
under
a
statute
which
says
that
women
are
qualified
to
be
jurors
and
then
goes
on
to
say
that
only
those
women
who
register
with
the
clerk
courts
may
be
called.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
there
are
additionally
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
--
three
states
which
exclude
women
entirely.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
so
that
there
are
six
states
today,
which
either
exclude
women
entirely
or
provide
that
they
must
volunteer.
now
what
happened
in
florida
is
apparently
what
happens
--
what
has
happened
in
states
--
other
states
where
they
had
this
type
of
statute,
we
have
cited
in
--
on
the
brief
the
reference
to
various
authorities,
mainly
that
where
women
have
to
volunteer
for
jury
service
there’s
practically
no
pool
out
of
which
women
can
be
drawn.
it
happened
in
new
york
and
it's
happened
in
other
jurisdictions
because
apparently
the
--
to
take
the
initiative
and
volunteer
for
jury
service
is
an
obstacle.
one
wonders
how
many
men
would
be
available
if
they
had
to
volunteer.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
yes.
despite
the
fact
that
i
shall
argue
that
women
and
men
are
very
different,
they
have
both
actuated
by
the
same
impulses
on
many
occasions
when
one
is
to
invite
themselves
to
public
service.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
pardon?
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
i
thought
i
qualified
it
by
saying
there
are
certain
particulars.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i'm
afraid
i
would.
that's
why
i
tried
to
be
conservative
in
my
statement.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
would
say
that
they
are
less
active
for
certain
reasons
of
tradition,
and
custom,
and
culture,
but
that
they
are
very
active
in
public
life
today,
extremely
so.
in
fact,
one
out
of
every
20
delegates
to
the
united
nations
is
a
woman.
so
that
one
out
of
20
delegates
in
united
nations
is
a
woman,
but
only
four
tenths
of
1%
of
the
eligible
women
in
florida
registered.
in
10
years
from
1947
to
1957,
218
to
220
women
registered
for
service
on
the
jury.
in
the
last
five
years,
only
35
registered
for
service.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that's
in
the
county.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
in
this
particular
county.
so
that
out
of
46,000
women
eligible
for
jury
service
in
hillsborough
county,
only
220
were
available
as
having
registered.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
no,
i
do
not
have
those
statistics.
i
do
know
this,
however,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
knows
that
new
york
now
has
a
different
statute.
women
may
be
exempted
because
(inaudible),
but
nevertheless,
there
are
many
women
serving
on
juries
to
the
state
of
new
york.
so
we
have
here
a
demonstration
coupled
with
authorities
who
confirm
that
that's
what's
happened
in
other
states
that
this
type
of
statute
just
doesn't
work
and
one
wonders
whether
it
was
intended
to
work.
i
am
reminded
of
mr.
justice
black's
remark
that
whether
ingeniously
or
ingenuously
women
--
a
certain
class
may
be
excluded.
the
effect
of
this
is
to
remove
women
almost
entirely
in
the
jury
list.
now,
we
come
to
the
question
of
the
administration
of
the
law
and
we
have
this
situation.
the
testimony,
it
is
in
the
record,
in
the
case
that
this
is
what
happens.
in
this
county
they're
required
to
make
up
a
list,
a
reservoir
of
60
thou
--
of
10,000
names
available
for
jury
service
and
out
of
that
10,000
names
a
panel
is
selected.
in
this
case,
the
jury
commissioners
through
their
clerk
or
through
their
clerk
--
or
through
the
clerk
of
court
testified
that
they
put
in
10
names
each
year
and
approximately
10,000
masculine
names,
so
that
whereas
on
the
operation
of
the
statute
only
one-third
of
1%
would
be
available
for
jury
service,
when
the
jury
commissioners
got
through
only
one-tenth
of
1
%
were
available
for
jury
service.
they
gave
no
explanation
of
this
other
than
to
say
that
they
had
always
done
it
and
this
was
the
testimony
on
page
17
of
the
record.
the
lady
who
made
up
this
list
of
10,000
names
said,
“mr.
lockhart
told
me
at
one
time
to
go
back
approximately
two
or
three
years
and
get
the
names
because
there
were
recent
women.”
and
she
said,
“well,
the
reason
i
placed
him
is,
i
went
back
two,
three,
or
four
years
and
noticed
how
many
women
they
had
put
on
before
and
i'd
put
on
approximately
the
same
number.”
that
is
for
four
years,
they
had
put
only
10
women's
names
in
and
she
did
the
same.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
think
1927,
yes.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
do
not
know.
i
only
have
a
guess.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
think
that
is
so,
but
i
would
be
guessing.
now
on
page
19
of
the
record,
we
find
that
this
took
place.
they
used
up
2500
names
of
10,000
from
the
year
before
so
that
the
jury
commissioners
then
were
putting
a
new
2500
names
into
--
to
make
up
the
10,000.
they
couldn't
use
the
names
of
those
who've
been
drawn
so
they
put
in
another
2500
names.
now
when
it
came,
if
your
honors
please,
to
the
second
2500
names,
no
women
at
all
were
put
in.
and
when
asked
why
that
was
so,
they
said,
“well,
we
had
10
names
in
there
that
weren't
drawn
from
the
year
before,
so
we
just
let
them
ride.”
so
that
apparently
for
years
also,
they
just
kept
these
same
10
women
in
there,
in
the
--
as
available
jurors
and
never
went
to
the
women's
list
at
all
and
this
is
her
testimony.
“in
2500
that
you
added,
were
there
any
new
women
added?”
“no
--
there
were
--
no,
there
were
no
new
women
added.”
“no
new
women
added
at
all?”
“no,
just
the
ones
that
were
in
the
box
still
of
the
7000,
which
were
those
that
were
left
from
the
preceding
year.”
“so
then
on
march
8,
1957,
no
women's
names
were
added
to
the
jury
list?”
“well,
they
weren't
added,
no.
we
just
used
the
ones
we
had”
and
then
a
question
by
mr.
hobbs,
“in
putting
this
in
march
8,
you
didn't
pay
a
bit
of
attention
to
this
list
at
all,”
meaning
women's
list,
“you
didn't
use
this
list
at
all?”
answer:
“no,
we
just
used
the
women
that
were
left
in
the
box.”
there
was
no
explanation
for
this.
i
think
it
was
just
--
it
must
have
been
that
(inaudible)
the
rest
of
the
testimony,
they
just
weren't
taking
it
seriously,
that's
all.”
service
of
women
on
jury,
hardly
any
of
them
volunteered.
they
paid
no
attention
to
the
duty
to
see
that
a
representative
jury
was
chosen.
now,
this
absence
and
exclusion
and
limitation
of
women
is
highlighted
by
the
fact
that
of
this
particular
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
as
told
by
the
judge
rothman's
majority
opinion
was
the
effect
on
the
defendant's
mind,
state
of
mind,
of
the
events
which
she
described
in
which
the
court
found
to
be
with
--
without
dispute
to
be
the
facts.
you
see,
the
jury
in
this
case
was
not
called
upon
to
reconcile
conflicting
facts.
there
is
no
doubt
that
mrs.
hoyt
struck
her
husband.
that
he
was
sent
to
the
hospital.
immediate
medical
attendants
couldn't
help
him.
he
died
during
the
night.
so
that
there
was
no
issue
of
fact
as
to
her
committing
the
act
was
concerned.
the
only
issue
before
the
jury
was
what
effect
did
the
marital
discord
at
her
attempts
to
get
her
husband
to
come
back
to
live
with
her
at
his
flat
as
you
will
see
from
the
judges
--
statement
her
flat
--
that
his
flat
refusal
have
anything
more
to
do
with
her
in
his
declaration
that
he
was
through
and
he
is
going
to
leave
her
and
her
little
boy
the
next
morning
for
good,
never
wanted
to
see
her
again.
and
it
was
at
that
moment
which
the
court
describes
she
happen
to
have
a
damaged
bat
in
her
hand
which
her
boy
had
found
in
an
alley
during
the
day,
that
had
left
on
the
floor
and
just
as
she
picked
that
thing
up,
he
then
signed
off.
he
said
he
was
through
with
her.
he
never
wanted
to
see
her
again
and
that's
when
she
struck
him
and
struck
him
several
times,
apparently
in
a
frenzy.
she
was
an
epileptic.
you
will
see
here
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
her
medical
history.
she
was
an
epileptic
with
damage
to
her
brain
and
she
went
out
of
control.
now,
i'm
suggesting
to
your
honor
that
i
don't
believe
a
professor
at
a
law
school
could
think
up
facts
of
a
case
which
tested
this
issue
of
the
exclusion
of
women
from
a
jury
more
than
this.
this
was
a
domestic
affair.
this
was
a
husband
and
wife
matter.
this
was
--
involved
all
the
complex
emotions
that
exists
in
a
relationship
of
that
type,
a
woman's
efforts
to
reclaim
her
husband,
his
scorn,
her
outburst.
now
apparently,
the
men
thought
that
what
she
did
was
evidence
of
a
depraved
state
of
mind.
we
don't
know
what
women
would
have
done
on
that
jury,
but
shouldn't
she
have
had
the
chance
of
having
a
woman
on
that
jury
who
would
have
said
that
--
now,
wait
a
minute,
this
woman
saw
her
home,
her
husband,
and
a
father
of
her
child
go
away.
in
one
final
statement
she
made
and
that
came
at
the
climax
of
the
day
of
considerable
emotion
in
which
she
had
struggle
to
reclaim.
maybe
she
wouldn't
have
said
it,
maybe
it
wouldn't
have
any
(inaudible)
--
wasn't
she
entitled
to
have
people
who
think
like
that
on
the
jury.
we
have
put
in
on
the
brief
here
references
to
sociological
studies
showing
the
difference
in
approach
frequently
between
men
and
women.
i
think
they
tend
to
backup
mr.
justice
douglas's
statement
that
they're
not
fungible,
men
and
women
are
not
fungible.
that
women
emphasize
more
the
home,
children,
husband,
their
approach
is
far
emotional.
they
are
mediators
rather
than
aggressors
in
discussion
and
after
all,
i
don't
think
that
these
studies
tell
us
anything
we
don't
know.
they
tend
to
corroborate
the
obvious
because
all
of
us
know
whether
it
is
from
literature,
what
every
women
knows
by
berry
or
(inaudible),
men
and
supermen
or
--
that
celebrated
song
that
in
my
fair
lady,
why
aren't
women
like
men,
that
there
is
a
difference
and
they
think
of
as
different.
and
that
while
individual
women
will
be
different
from
men
about
--
perhaps
be
not
so
very
different
from
men
--
as
a
class
they
are
different.
i
am
reminded
of
–
(inaudible)
was
once
introduced
at
a
suffragist
meeting
as
a
woman
with
a
brain
of
a
man.
and
in
responding
to
the
introduction
she
said
before
i
regard
that
as
a
compliment,
i'd
like
to
see
the
man
whose
brain
i
have.
now,
mrs.
hoyt
was
denied
in
a
case
in
which
it
is
thrown
into
high
relief,
the
mediating,
the
understanding
of
a
woman
who
sees
her
home,
the
father,
the
child
and
the
husband
going
away
after
as
i
said
it,
terrifically
tensed
emotional
day.
i
will
not
go
into
all
of
the
facts.
you
--
your
honors
will
read
them,
but
that
was
the
situation.
it
is
a
question
of
evaluating
how
far
these
pressures
broke
her
down
which
would
have
made
all
difference
in
the
world
between
a
decision
as
to
whether
she
was
suffering
from
temporary
insanity,
whether
it
was
manslaughter,
or
whether
she
had
a
depraved
mind.
and
this
jury
of
12
men
decided
that
she
had
a
depraved
mind.
and
so
she
was
sentenced
to
30
years
at
hard
labor
and
so
we
are
here
before
your
honors.
now
i
don't
think
it
requires
very
much
argument
just
to
show
that
women
are
a
different
class.
we
live
with
these
things
so
much,
if
your
honor
please,
that
we
forget
that
they
exist.
it's
like
a
person
who
is
working
in
a
factory
and
the
hum
is
constantly
going
on,
he
doesn't
even
notice
the
hum
anymore.
my
associate,
mrs.
dreben
here
who
wrote
most
of
the
brief
experimented
by
asking
men
what
they
thought
of
this
case.
well,
some
were
indifferent,
some
thought
--
the
moment
she
would
say
to
them,
supposing
that
a
man
was
being
tried
for
killing
his
wife
or
his
mistress
in
a
rage
and
supposing
the
jury
consisted
of
12
women,
what
would
you
think
then
and
that
apparently
woke
them
right
up,
they
said
of
course,
that
wouldn't
be
fair.
the
thing
is
that
we
just
get
accustomed.
there's
been
no
class
i
might
say
in
all
history
that
has
been
so
universally
and
persistently
discriminate
against
in
women.
it's
only
on
the
last
half
century
that
they've
been
emerging
from
a
position
of
inferiority.
they
are
also
excluded
from
eating
spices,
but
i
don't
notice
that
they
are
having
sit
outs
as
a
result
of
it,
but
there
is
this
short
division.
and
--
while
--
during
the
certain
periods
of
time
as
your
honors
know
that
--
they
were
--
they
had
no
legal
personality
at
all
particularly
if
they
were
married.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
it
might
be
if
i
was
ordered
off
the
premises,
if
i
follow
the
discussion
right.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
sir?
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
and
if
i
were
a
member
of
an
excluding
class?
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
is
true.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
the
law
at
length
because
to
speak
frankly,
nearly
everything
i
have
learned
of
constitutional
law
in
this
area
i've
learned
from
you.
i
mean
the
last
10
or
15
years
has
been
remarkable
for
a
development
of
the
law
relating
to
this
whole
question
of
the
selection
of
jurors,
both
in
the
majority
opinions,
in
the
dissents
and
the
concurring
opinions
for
different
reasons.
one
by
one,
the
early
distinctions
have
been
removed
by
this
court
such
as
that
it
relates
only
to
color
and
race
because
the
congress
have
passed
the
statute
on
that
subject.
or,
that
you
have
to
show
prejudice
to
show
denial
of
equal
protection,
or
the
fact
that
--
our
concepts
of
equal
protection
have
been
changing.
i
remember
in
one
of
the
cases
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
said,
it's
about
time
that
we
recognize
the
fact
that
we
now
have
a
different
perception
what
constitutes
equal
protection.
this
court
has
been
bringing
in
many
of
the
judges
that
are
sitting
here,
have
been
bringing
the
constitutional
question
on
the
selection
of
jury
abreast
of
the
times.
there's
no
longer
any
distinction
as
to
it
--
that
if
a
class
is
an
economic
class
or
if
a
class
is
not
one
of
race
or
color
but
of
a
nationality
or
of
any
other
group.
in
the
hernandez
case
which
firmly
states
that
if
a
defendant
is
a
member
of
a
class
which
is
excluded
and
there
is
no
justification
for
it,
it
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection,
and
that's
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
only
issue
that
we
have
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
sufficient
justification
for
this
statute.
if
there
is,
then
the
statute
is
constitutional,
but
it's
no
excuse
for
the
behavior
of
the
jury
commissioners
who
arbitrarily
limited
what
little
chance
there
was.
but
what
justification
is
there
for
the
statute?
the
trial
judge
himself
who
apparently
belongs
to
the
old
school,
if
you
read
his
ruling
on
this
subject
that
women
were
descended
to
the
level
of
men
when
they
got
equal
rights,
even
he
said
it's
a
silly
statute,
but
it's
not
for
me,
it's
for
higher
court
to
say
whether
it's
constitutional.
it's
true,
the
majority
opinion
goes
back
to
the
women's
places
on
the
home
and
urges
that,
but
the
majority
opinion
doesn't
--
i
mean
the
minority
opinion
also
regards
to
law
as
a
completely
unjustifiable
law.
women
are
fully
participating
in
all
aspects
of
life
today.
i
--
my
attention
has
just
been
called
to
another
item
here
that
i
forgot
to
mention.
i
had
stated
that
there
were
218
to
220
women
who
had
registered.
the
trial
judge
in
justifying
his
ruling
on
the
administration
of
the
law
stated
that
27%
of
the
available
women
were
on
the
10,000
list
and
the
10,000
was
15%
of
the
men,
60
odd
thousand.
how
we
happened
to
make
the
error,
we
don't
know
because
it
was
only
3%,
4%
and
5%.
and
apparently
the
supreme
court
of
florida
accepted
that
error
and
it
was
discovered
when
we
were
preparing
the
appeal
papers.
so
that
we
have
a
situation
whether
a
very
few
women
--
the
women
were
cut
out
on
the
jury
commissions
and
then
the
judge
who
tried
the
case
in
his
ruling
through
a
gross
error
misrepresents
the
number
that
were
available.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
yes.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
don't
know
but
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
the
fifth
amendment
as
i
understand
it
has
not
been
incorporated
in
the
rule
that
it
applies
to
states.
but
i
would
--
i
want
to
answer
your
honor's
question.
where
we
have
a
question
of
justification,
i
want
to
answer
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
where
we
have
a
question
of
justifying
a
state
statue,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
should
not
justify
a
20th
century
anachronism
by
justifications
that
might
have
been
valid
100
years
ago.
and
i
think
your
honors,
you're
one
of
the
first
to
recognize
that
with
in
some
of
the
decisions
that
we
are
not
using
ancient
justifications
to
justify
injustices
of
today.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
why?
i
suppose.
well
that,
i
couldn't
say
because
i
don't
know
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
--
where
the
control
lies
in
the
power
of
the
legislature.
they
--
but
i
would
say
this
that
i
am
not
here
urging
the
right
of
women
to
serve
on
juries.
i
am
here
defending
a
woman
who
is
sentenced
to
30
years
at
hard
labor
because
she
--
at
least
i
won't
say
because
but
without
the
benefit
of
having
women
on
the
jury.
now
if
the
statute
operates
so
that
women
don't
come
on
the
jury
and
if
there
is
no
such
statute
women
are
on
the
jury,
then
i
don't
think
we
need
to
discuss
it.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
mr.
justice,
we
do
not
know.
we
--
all
we
know
is
that
between
1952
and
1957,
only
35
women
registered.
that's
as
far
as
our
knowledge
goes
whether
--
where
any
new
registrations
in
that
last
year
or
not,
i
don't
know.
we
haven't
any
record.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
but
we
only
that
in
five
years,
only
35
women
registered
but
whether
any
of
them
registered
the
last
year
just
before
this
year,
we
don't.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
where
year
after
year
for
four
or
five
years,
they
limit
the
number
to
10,
your
honor
i
suggest
that
that
alone
would
be
discrimination.
there
were
two
--
there
were
in
addition
to
the
10
that
were
in,
there
were
about
208
to
210
other
women
that
could've
been
chosen
just
as
there
were
these
men.
we
don't
know
--
you
see,
men
didn't
have
to
register.
they
were
already
on
the
elector's
list.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
yes.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
there
certainly
wouldn't
have
been
any
exclusion
of
men,
where
10,
000
names
were
put
in,
all
male.
now,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
don't
you
think
that
if
they
don't
put
in
more
than
10
names
whether
they're
the
old
10
names,
or
new
10
names,
that
that
is
an
arbitrary
limitation?
and
this
court
has
decided
in
several
cases
that
limitation
is
just
as
bad
as
exclusion.
now
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
yes.
it
would
be
by
one
third
of
1%.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
three
tenth
of
1%,
approximately.
so
they
reduced
the
chance
from
one
third
of
1%
to
one
tenth
of
1%.
it's
a
pitiful
chance
in
any
event
but
they
reduces
that.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
yes.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well
your
honor
summarized
it
so
well,
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
violate
my
red
and
white
light
and
talk
any
further.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
i
agree
a
100%.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
the
only
way
that
we
can
gauge
this
is
by
the
--
is
by
the
way
the
list
itself
was
administered
and
they
administered
it
by
arbitrarily
limiting
to
10
each
year,
the
number
that
were
available.
now
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
it
doesn't
matter.
the
fact
that
they
put
the
same,
it
didn't
--
they
did
the
same
--
and
they
didn't
even
look
at
the
list
indicates
that
they
thought
it
was
a
joke.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
but
other
than
that,
if
there's
no
legal
difference
between
the
two.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
right.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that's
it,
exactly,
yes.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
know
whether
you
wish
to
have
this
information,
but
it's
an
answer
to
the
question
that
you
asked.
mr.
hardee
who
tried
this
case
in
hillsborough
county
has
just
given
me
a
note
in
which
he
says
that
in
1956,
not
one
--
one
woman
has
gone
on
any
panel
in
all
the
courts
of
the
county.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
hillsborough
county.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
tampa,
isn't?
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
about
400,000
--
i'm
about
to
say
your
honor,
about
300,000.
mr.
hardy
tried
the
case
(inaudible)
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
pardon.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that's
the
county
where
the
case
was
tried.
