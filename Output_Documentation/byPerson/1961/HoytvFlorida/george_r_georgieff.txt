mr.
george
r.
georgieff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
address
myself
any
to
these
propositions,
i'd
like
to
thank
the
indulgence
of
the
ladies
in
the
audience
and
of
course
my
good
wife
wherever
she
happens
to
be
for
the
things
that
i'm
about
to
say.
they
may
not
quite
square
with
what
woman
would
think.
first,
i'd
like
to
say
that
a
pronouncement
made
here
today
that
this
is
the
first
case
that
has
come
to
this
court's
attention
involving
this
precise
problem
is
not
quite
correct.
it
is
the
first
case
in
which
we
can
expect
an
opinion
of
one
sort
or
another,
but
in
the
case
of
state
versus
drafer
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
that
came
out
of
louisiana,
it
pays
me
to
admit
that
all
you
did
was
deny
cert.
i
could've
used
an
opinion
has
it
been
on
my
side,
but
you
didn't
do
that,
you
simply
denied
certiorari.
their
statute
is
literally
a
mirror
of
this
one.
it
requires
that
they
go
to
their
district
courts
and
register
their
wish
to
be
considered
as
jurors.
i
don't
know
why
you
did,
therefore
i'll
discuss
it
no
further.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
indeed.
it's
a
red
flag
case
in
every
particular
except
that
no
opinion
was
written.
now,
i
think
that
the
first
question
to
be
determined
or
discussed
in
any
case
is
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional
because
if
it
is,
then
and
only
then
do
we
have
to
get
to
the
proposition
of
whether
this
jury
commission
functioned
properly
or
it
didn't.
now
of
course
if
it
isn't,
there's
no
point
discussing
that.
it's
sort
of
like
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse.
i
say
it's
constitutional
because
you
have
said
it
was
in
strauder
versus
west
virginia
and
you
haven't
yet
changed
your
mind.
you
may
after
today,
i
don't
know
that,
but
in
any
case,
all
of
the
glowing
statistics
that
we
have
to
support
the
proposition
that
women
are
no
longer
the
backward
crew
that
we
have
made
them
since
time
immemorial,
or
i
take
it
brought
forth
to
demonstrate
one
thing,
that
is
to
say
that
they
are
eminently
qualified
to
serve
as
jurors.
i
do
not
say
they're
not.
they
probably
were
many
years
ago,
but
i
do
say
that
when
this
court
considered
the
proposition
in
making
its
dictum
statement
in
strauder
versus
west
virginia,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
made
that
pronouncement
because
women
do
not
comprise
38%
of
the
working
force,
nor
that
they
have
made
inroads
on
politics,
business,
economic,
and
social
levels.
i
think
they
did
it
because
of
classic
differences
that
no
attainment
can
change.
they
are
women
because
they
are
women.
they
have
functions
to
perform
that
no
ascension
of
the
scale
can
make
any
difference
here.
they
bear
our
children.
they're
the
ones
(inaudible),
not
the
men.
we
may
find
isolated
cases
of
this
but
in
the
main,
this
is
their
function
until
that
is
changed
we
can't
even
address
the
proposition.
what
move
this
court
to
say
what
it
did
in
strauder
versus
west
virginia
was
not
the
reverse
of
it
--
of
the
statistical
approach,
but
rather
that
there
were
things
that
women
were
confined
to
in
that
their
very
nature
required
them
to
perform
to
the
exclusion
of
men.
they
have
to
take
care
of
these
things
not
the
men
and
it
was
likely
the
opinion
of
this
court
that
to
require
them
to
serve
in
this
capacity
would
make
it
difficult
for
somebody
to
raise
these
children,
to
prepare
the
food,
to
keep
the
home,
and
to
do
other
things
that
woman
customarily
do
and
to
this
day
do.
now
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
did
not
mean
mr.
chief
justice
to
start
with
that
premise,
carry
it
through
or
bring
it
up
in
the
future.
i
will
address
myself
to
the
position
you've
taken
in
just
a
few
moments.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
first,
our
statute
does
not
exclude
any
women.
in
1946
when
this
was
considered,
we
had
a
statute
40.01
which
is
precisely
the
one
we
have
here
which
made
no
reference
to
women.
they
could
not
serve
on
a
jury
on
florida
until
40.01
was
amended
to
read
as
it
presently
does
and
as
it's
cited
in
the
brief.
now,
that
does
not
exclude
women
in
any
degree
whatever.
they
are
required
to
be
qualified
electors
just
as
men
are.
the
only
further
requirement
is
that
they
go
to
somebody
and
say,
“look,
i'm
not
possessed
of
any
of
these
infirmities
that
you've
recognized
over
the
years,
therefore,
consider
me
when
you
pick
up
this
jury
list
and
include
me
in
it.
i
have
time
and
the
inclination
to
do
this.”
if
we
had
said
or
if
we
were
here
on
the
proposition
that
women
cannot
serve
on
a
jury,
it
might
well
be
a
different
story.
i
suppose
i'd
be
a
little
more
hard
put
to
answer
the
position
that
you've
taken
mr.
chief
justice,
but
now,
this
simply
says,
“you
are
the
ones
that
must
go
to
the
judge
if
we
don't
have
this”,
and
say,
“well
look
your
honor,
i
have
seven
children
at
home
and
who
is
going
to
take
care
of
them.”
and
he
says,
“alright
ma'am,
you
don't
have
to
serve
on
this
jury,
go
on
home
and
take
care
of
your
family.”
so
what
is
the
difference
if
she
now
decides
that
because
she
does
have
the
same
seven
children,
she
won't
go
to
the
clerk
unless
and
until
such
time
she
has
the
time,
inclination,
and
the
ability
to
do
so.
they
have
throughout
their
brief
taken
the
position
that
why
do
we
have
something
like
this
when
the
judge
enjoys
a
broad
discretion
and
he
can
release
somebody
of
the
requirement
of
jury
duty,
especially
if
they
have
these
pressing
problems.
i
concede
that
he
does
and
if
he
does,
what
difference
does
it
make
that
she
exercises
it
affirmatively
by
going
to
court
in
response
to
the
summons,
or
does
it
beforehand
according
to
the
statute.
if
she
is
the
one
who
is
able
to
determine
whether
she
can
and
will,
then
surely
she
should
be
able
to
do
it
now
and
this
was
substantially
the
same
thing
that
you
had
in
fay,
fay
versus
new
york
case.
now,
there
the
court
concluded
that
it
did
not
violate
due
process
to
have
a
jury
that
was
enlivened
by
a
woman.
now
it's
true
that
a
woman
wasn't
the
defendant
in
that
case,
but
even
in
the
dissent
it
the
fay
case,
nobody
made
any
mention
of
the
fact
that
women
had
been
effectively
excluded,
such
as
they
say
here
today.
the
point
is,
i
made
the
distinction
which
i
think
is
a
valid
one,
and
of
course
the
court
may
not
agree,
but
i
said
the
difference
is
in
availability
and
eligibility.
the
law
does
not
say
that
women
aren't
eligible
to
serve
as
jurors
in
florida,
it
simply
says,
“if
you
want
to
become
available
go
to
the
clerk.”
now
they
are
the
ones
who
guard
the
availability.
if
they
don't
go,
they're
not
available.
if
they
do,
let's
presume
that
the
46,000
in
hillsborough
county
had
all
of
the
sudden
decided
that
they
wanted
to
serve
or
be
considered
for
service
as
jurors,
and
they
all
went
into
the
clerk,
their
argument
must
be
just
as
sound
if
every
one
of
them
were
down
there.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
should
imagine
that
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
not
to
me
sir,
no
it
wouldn't.
as
to
the
difference
between
the
two
it
would.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
in
other
words,
if
i
take
the
position
that
it
makes
the
difference
if
we
say
that
to
men,
then
obviously
my
position
now
is
got
to
be
fallacious.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
reason
we
have
this
difference
with
women
is
because
they
are
the
ones
that
do
have
all
these
infirmities
that
no
amount
of
ascension
on
the
social
scale
can
erase.
now
that's
one
that
i
can't
change
no
matter
what
i
do,
so
it's
unlikely
that
this
would
be
the
case.
this
is
unfortunately
a
man's
world
and
for
some
time,
i
must
--
i'm
afraid
it's
going
to
remain
one
and
i
don't
know
that
i
can
in
good
conscience
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
perhaps
so.
i
stand
corrected
to
that
extent,
but
--
alright,
let's
just
say
that
it
is,
whether
we
honestly
believe
it
or
not,
but
until
such
time
as
on
the
surface
it
becomes
something
other
than
that,
i
can't
in
good
conscience
say,
“well
i
could
see
that
this
would
be
the
same
situation
if
we
said
that
men
had
to
register.”
in
other
words,
it's
like
envisioning
$700
billion.
it
doesn't
mean
anything
to
me.
i
don't
know
how
they
could
do
this
with
the
structure
of
mankind
being
what
it
is.
and
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
an
ill
choice
of
word
mr.
chief
justice.
all
i
mean
is
the
traditional
reasons
that
women
have
to
stay
home.
in
other
words
to
prepare
meals
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
to
raise
children
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
keep
the
house,
etcetera.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
nothing
more.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
afraid
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
don't
quite
understand.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
quite
agree.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was,
that
was
the
case
where
the
wage
workers,
the
hourly
wage
workers
were
discriminated
against,
thiel
versus
southern
pacific
i
think.
that
too
probably
would
be
a
factor
here,
but
as
i
say,
i
think
that
this
statute
considering
what
we
had
in
1946,
as
a
decidedly
salutary
effect
for
the
women
of
the
state
of
florida.
now
admittedly
when
people
are
required
to
go
down
and
do
something,
experience,
i
suppose
general
experience
that
we
can
all
take
knowledge
of,
judicial
knowledge
of
is
the
fact
that
they're
reluctant
to
do
so
for
whatever
reason,
but
my
point
is
very
simply,
if
all
46,000
of
them
had
gone
down
and
registered,
essentially
the
position
of
the
appellant
has
got
to
be
the
same.
because
if
the
condemnation
is
directed
to
this
requirement
of
registration,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
one
did
or
all
of
them
did.
if
you're
going
to
condemn
it
because
of
that
requirement,
then
i
don't
care
whether
anyone
--
any
of
them
did.
it's
the
requirement
that
you're
after
and
my
point
is
very
simply
that
it
isn't
a
requirement.
it's
simply
allows
them
to
determine
beforehand
whether
they
will
or
won't.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
think
i
first
said
at
least
in
the
first
few
pronouncements
that
i've
made
that
there
was
no
exclusion
of
any
kind.
and
then
i
further
said
that
i
made
the
distinction
between
eligibility
of
women
for
jury
service
and
availability
and
i
think
that
constitutes
a
two-fold
answer.
there
is
no
exclusion
whatsoever.
now
it
may
be
that
no
woman
is
ever
picked
by
chance
out
of
the
jury
box.
i
don't
know
that
that
will
ever
happen
but
it
may
not
and
then
again
you've
got
to
condemn.
i
simply
say
that
this
doesn't
exclude
any
of
them
if
they
want
to
serve.
now,
these
cases
that
they
have
cited
for
the
proposition
of
this
has
got
to
be
condemned
because
of
a
systematic
exclusion
there
was
that
precise
thing
either
by
statute
or
by
operation.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
wonder
how
much
mathematics
would
be
involved
before
i
answer
that.
in
other
words,
if
only
one
had,
i
don't
know
what
i
would
say,
probably
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
again
i've
got
to
go
back
to
the
cases
that
they
have
cited
in
support
of
their
condemnation.
now,
what
do
you
decide
is
a
systematic,
intentional
planned
exclusion.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
is
that
one
--
just
a
one
time,
isn't
that
enough
to
condemn
it,
i
say,
“no.”
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it's
just
my
opinion.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
considering
if
they
had
up
until
1952
and
i
maybe
a
little
incorrect
in
my
mathematics,
in
hillsborough
county
they
had
--
let's
say
228
less
35
that
registered
between
1952
and
1957
which
is
our
critical
year,
considering
that
that
was
so,
i
should
say
that
if
they
did
that,
did
not
add
anymore
than
the
ten,
that
if
it
was
a
requirement
that
they
add,
we'd
soon
run
out
of
women's
names
if
we
have
no
further
registrants,
because
it
all
turns
on
whether
they
come
down
to
register.
now,
this
business
of
adding
to
them
each
time
you
have
a
depleted
box,
i
understand
the
consternation,
but
if
you
have
to
add
in
order
to
serve,
in
order
to
serve
this
idea
of
not
being
systematic
in
your
exclusion,
then
if
you
don't
have
enough
of
them
who
have
registered,
what
happens
when
you
run
out
of
them?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it
sounds
--
some
type
of
a
continuous
number.
the
record
doesn't
support
simply
10,
they
said
10
or
12.
now
of
those
that
were
available
to
them
they
couldn't
simply
pick
out
a
woman
elector's
name
for
then
they
would
have
been
violating
the
law,
because
it
requires
that
they
take
only
of
those
who
had
registered.
now
of
those
that
were
available
to
them
to
select
from
either
this
was
or
was
not
a
representative
group.
i
think
it's
just
as
simple
as
that.
our
supreme
court
in
writing
the
affirming
opinion
did
not
conclude
that
judge
grayson's
figures
were
correct
nor
did
they
adopt
them.
mr.
justice
drew
in
writing
the
majority
opinion
simply
cons
--
simply
said
that
this
is
a
representative
portion
of
the
available
women
jurors.
now,
obviously
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that
pronouncement,
then
there
is
nothing
i
can
do,
but
either
it
is
or
it
is
not
representative.
now
somewhere
along
the
line,
it
got
to
be
arbitrary.
the
jury
commission
has
to
pick
either
this
name
or
that
name.
now,
of
this
228
or
whatever
it
was
that
were
available,
they
decided
somewhere
along
the
line
somehow
because
they're
vested
with
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
that
of
this
amount,
10
should
be
a
representative
number
and
they
did
that.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
that's
a
good
question
judge.
i
wish
i
could
tell
you.
i
feel
a
good
deal
better
if
they
had
but
unfortunate
that's
not
so.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
as
i
said
before
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
truth
of
the
matter
is
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
it
wouldn't
have
mattered
a
bit.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
am
still
addressing
myself
to
the
proposition
that
this
statute
is
constitutional.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
if
we
say,
why
did
we
not
put
in
all
the
228
or
whatever
it
was,
let's
say
250
names,
why
didn't
we
go
on
ahead
and
put
in
the
whole
114,000
qualified
electors?
it
isn't
necessary.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
again,
i
must
confess
i
don't
think
i
understand
the
justice.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
all
of
them?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
the
women.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
alright.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
it
would've
increased
the
margin
or
the
percentage
opportunity
that
the
appellant
would've
had
of
securing
one
when
they
drew
the
petit
jury
panel.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
to
be
sure,
but
it
would
have
been
equally
important
if
we
had
nothing
there
to
prevent
all
of
46,000
women
electors
in
hillsborough
county
from
being
available.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
there's
a
difference
judge
and
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
its
somewhere
around
228,
i
think.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
just
ten
less
than
10,000.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
(inaudible)
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
to
be
sure,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
i
wished
they
had.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
at
least
then,
i
would
be
able
to
come
before
you
and
say,
“well
now
look,
they
followed
the
statute
as
it
is
and
they
took
everyone
of
them
that
they
had
available.”
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
but
the
record
doesn't
bear
it
out
to
be
arbitrary.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
certainly
not.
let's
limit
it
to
12.
i
think
the
record
will
bear
that
out.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
would
say,
yes
of
course.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
i
take
it
your
honor,
the
only
--
the
only
response
i
can
make
that's
borne
out
by
the
record
is,
if
the
10,
12
or
19
that
we
settle
for
is
representative
of
those
that
they
had
available
to
them
when
they
first
filled
the
box,
that
it
was
representative,
if
they
hadn't
used
any
others
when
they
refilled
it.
now,
if
it
wasn't
representative,
at
the
time
they
originally
compiled
the
10,000,
of
those
218,
that
requires
a
decision
to
be
made
by
the
jury
commissioners
that
in
this
vast
scheme
of
the
jury
system
we
have
to
have
women
because
it
has
a
salutary
effect.
they
are
not
required
to
do
that.
they
are
simply
required
to
select
people
from
the
list
of
available
qualified
electors
who
in
their
arbitrary
choice
are
people
who
are
going
to
be
considered
as
jurors.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it
would
have
to
be
just
as
alright
as
this
position
in
order
for
me
to
be
sound
on
all
flags.
i
couldn't
take
it
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
i
understand.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
i
think
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
perhaps
so.
perhaps
so
but
i
think
that
if
that
infirmity,
if
you
back
it
up
by
saying,
“it's
been
demonstrated
over
the
years
that
only
a
handful
of
them
do
come
in
and
register”
and
of
course
that's
so
in
hillsborough
county
by
the
actual
count
that
the
record
bears
out,
then
let's
address
ourselves
in
the
fact
that
the
legislature
should
change
that.
if
it's
brought
to
their
attention,
let
them
alter
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
to
register
with
the
clerk
their
wish
to
serve.
after
all
228
out
of
46,000
is
not
too
many.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
indeed.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
indeed.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
couldn't
say
it
better.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
indeed,
precisely.
you
can
look
at
the
record
and
if
you
listen
to
mr.
ehrmann,
he
said
to
you,
that
they
took
this
lightly,
didn't
pay
any
attention,
they
had
simply
said,
“oh
well,
10
or
12
before,
we'll
put
in
10
now,”
that's
not
systematic
plan
of
exclusion
like
you've
condemn.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
am
satisfied
she
could.
i
don't
have
any
doubt
of
it,
i
don't
believe.
assuming
that
the
discretion
of
judges
is
much
the
same
over
the
country,
i'm
sure
that
he
wouldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
if
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh,
with
the
clerk
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
of
the
circuit
courts,
she
could
pick
it
up
i'm
sure
anytime
she
wanted.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
anytime
at
all.
now
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
can
tell
you
firsthand
about
the
county
in
which
the
state
capital
is
located,
which
is
leon
county
and
has
a
high
incidence
of
criminal
practice,
a
petit
jury
panel
in
the
last
four
years
has
seldom,
if
ever
been
drawn,
that
did
not
include
a
woman.
now
i
couldn't
pretend
to
speak
for
the
66
remaining
counties,
i
don't
have
any
idea
and
there
is
no
way
that
we
keep
track
of
it
and
possibly
the
clerks
in
the
circuit
court
might
have
(inaudible)
--
might
give
us
some
information
but
i
don't
really
know
in
miami
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice
that
would
of
course
vary
with
the
right
of
counsel
to
reject.
i'd
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
in
the
capital
cases,
they
invariably
have
one.
in
the
less
than
capital,
which
is
a
six-man
jury
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
the
petit
jury
panel.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
isn't
that
your
question?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh,
the
number
that
are
registered?
is
that
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
by
actual
count,
that'd
be
difficult
since
the
number
of
them
do
it
by
repetition.
if
you
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
in
the
past
four
to
five
years
which
is
the
only
time
about
which
i
can
speak
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
in
anything
less
than
capital,
it's
only
a
six-man
jury.
it's
12
only
in
capital
cases
and
eminent
domain
proceedings.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
i
had
specific
reference
mr.
justice
black
to
the
ultimate
panel
which
hears
the
cause.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
what
--
i
thought
that's
what
the
justices'
question
was.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh,
i
think
they
start
out
in
groups
of
75
and
they
exhaust
that
if
they
have
to
then
go
to
the
next
75
and
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
sir.
i
--
i
never
come
to
that
stage
of
it.
i
couldn't
tell
you.
essentially,
since
my
time
is
about
to
expire,
my
position
is
very
simply,
that
if
anybody
limits
the
number
of
women
that
are
available
as
potential
jurors
in
the
state
of
florida,
it's
the
women
themselves.
now,
if
that
is
bad,
because
they
don't
demonstrate
an
interest
or
a
wish
to
serve
in
this
capacity,
then
let
them
modify
it
by
legislative
addition
or
some
other
way.
at
this
date,
at
this
precise
date
in
an
eminent
domain
proceeding
in
the
state
of
florida,
no
woman
is
permitted
to
serve
on
the
jury.
we're
not
here
on
that,
but
i
bring
it
up
for
whatever
its
worth.
if
they
don't
demonstrate
an
interest
in
this,
let
the
legislature
take
this
away
and
require
them
to.
now,
if
they
are
everything
that
we
have
been
told
they
were,
and
if
they
are
constantly
on
an
ascending
scale,
then
it
flies
under
the
teeth
of
this
low
qual
--
quantity
of
women
who
come
to
the
circuit
court
clerk,
and
say,
“look,
i
want
to
serve”.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
to
be
sure.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it
and
i
--
i
myself
as
i
have
said
it
before,
i
think
it's
salutary.
the
other
proposition
is
very
simply
that
this
--
this
woman
did
not
have
a
right
to
a
woman
on
this
jury.
she
simply
had
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury,
no
friends,
just
an
impartial
jury.
she
hasn't
said
she
didn't
have
one.
she
just
said
she'd
rather
have
the
other
one.
i
think
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed
and
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
--
rather
is
constitutional
both
on
its
face,
and
certainly
as
it
was
administered
from
what
they
had
available.
thank
you.
