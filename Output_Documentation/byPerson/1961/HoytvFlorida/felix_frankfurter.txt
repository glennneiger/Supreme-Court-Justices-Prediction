one
of
the
argument
as
to
women
suffrage
was
that
women
would
be
more
aggressive
or
at
least
more
alert
(inaudible)
than
men.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
stress
that
too
hard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
stress
the
equality
of
behavior
between
the
men
and
women
too
hard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'd
get
into
trouble
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
got
any
--
have
we
any
statistics
as
to
the
number
of
women
that
can
serve,
that
are
eligible
in
the
federal
courts
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
that
can
serve?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
probably
exclude
it
altogether,
weren't
they
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
sure
you
haven't
--
you
remarked
a
minute
ago,
that
there's
an
incitement
of
breach
of
the
peace.
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you're
a
woman
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you
were
a
woman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ehrmann,
later
--
december
1946,
this
court
didn't
--
i
think
i
was
justified
in
saying
it
in
my
dissent,
the
court
didn't
rule
that
as
a
matter
of
due
process
which
under
the
federal
law
impliedly
include
equal
protection
that
the
exclusion
of
women
constitutes
an
inroad
upon
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
fourth
amend
--
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
that
was
1946,
we
now
have
1961.
would
you
say
to
the
fair
statement
of
the
problem
in
this
case
to
say
that
what
we
really
--
what
i
really
have
to
decide
for
myself
is
to
what
extent
--
the
law
still
reflects
history,
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
the
real
problem?
to
what
extent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
catch-up
with
this
movement
of
which
you
spoke,
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
extent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
decision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
exhilarate
on
constitutional
grounds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
--
i
can
think
of
other
justifac
--
other
consideration,
namely,
if
women
are
as
politically
aggressive
as
they
are,
that
they
really
want
not
to
have
a
system
like
this
operate
whereby
they
have
to
come
forward
and
say,
i
want
to
serve
or
that
a
legislature
may
take
that
into
account.
that
they
expressed
really
the
feelings
of
the
women
at
large
as
a
group
instead
of
being
discriminating
against
and
this
statute
may
be
deemed
a
reflection
of
their
desires.
if
they
really
wanted
to
be
called
like
men,
there'd
be
no
trouble
about
getting
that
legislation
through
even
in
florida,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
of
course
two
questions
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question
before
you
sit
down.
there
are
two
questions
as
i
see
it
in
this
case.
one
is
--
well,
one
is
that
the
statute
as
such
requiring
them
to
come
forward
and
express
willingness
to
serve
as
a
juror,
if
that
as
such
is
bad,
offends
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
question
and
which
i
wish
without
arguing,
you
just
summarize
what
the
--
what
your
case
is,
the
other
problem
is
that
even
that
system,
even
that
system
which
allows
them
and
to
come
forward
has
been
so
administered
that
in
its
actual
operation
it
doesn't
give
voluntariness
an
adequate
chance
to
operate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not
violate
anything
if
you
answer
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
--
what
is
the
supporting
evidence
in
the
latter,
for
the
latter
statement
namely,
that
as
it
operate
--
as
it
was
administered,
the
element
of
voluntariness
wasn't
actually
operating.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
even
the
same
10
or
it
doesn't
matter,
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
area
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
element
of
chance
by
which
you
pull
out
one
ticket
rather
than
another
was
necessarily
reduced
if
you
only
add
10
out
of
which
to
pay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
--
make
a
difference,
how
many
women
--
what
the
experience
in
other
jurisdictions
has
it
been
as
to
excuses
given
by
women
to
serve
on
juries
where
they're
required
to
serve?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
i
don't
know
what
the
--
that's
why
i
asked
a
question
to
mr.
ehrmann,
suppose
the
experience
has
been
because
i'm
quite
sure
it
has
been,
that
many
more
women
ask
to
be
excused
from
jury
duty
than
men
do,
that
would
a
relevant
factor
in
shaping
the
kind
of
legislation
that
a
state
shape
--
that
a
state
shapes
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
jury
duty
by
women.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
they
didn't
throw
in
all
the
200
odd?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
the
legal
--
is
it
irrelevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
–
we're
not
here
to
answer
--
ask
good
questions,
we're
here
to
ask
relevant
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
--
i'm
not
questioning
you,
i
just
don't
understand
what
that
means.
suppose,
they'd
all
been
put
in,
would
that
have
--
would
that
have
rendered
it
and
they've
picked
only
and
out
of
the
lot
there,
(inaudible)
to
pick
three
that
become
jurors,
would
that
have
rendered
the
other's
functus
or
functus,
i
suppose
i
rather
say,
functus
officio
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
be
the
consequence
if
they
put
in
all
the
available
jurors
that
were
on
the
list,
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
women.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
women.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
suppose
that
(inaudible)
--
and
you
carry
on
from
there
with
this
consequence,
what
would
happen?
what
would've
happened?
you
said
you
wish
they
had?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
rather
important,
isn't
it
from
the
defendant's
point
of
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
weren't
and
they
--
i'm
assuming
with
you
for
purposes
of
my
question,
i'm
assuming
that
the
statute
is
constitutional.
i'm
now
asking
you
as
i
asked
mr.
ehrmann,
what
the
actual
translation
into
administration
of
that
system
was
and
out
of
the
available
lot,
they
picked
10
in
a
total
of
how
many,
how
many
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
in
the
total
jury
potential?
justice
felix
frankfurter
ten
out
of
10,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
now
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
law
of
probability,
if
there
had
been
225
women's
names,
the
chances
of
drawing
a
woman's
name
would
have
been
greater
than
if
there
had
been
only
ten
women's
name.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
be
sure.
now
what
i
am
asking
you
is
why
didn't
they
put
in
all
of
those
names
and
you
said
they
wish
they
had.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wished,
yes
that's
what
i
--
you
wished
they
had.
presumably
that
would
have
made
a
different
case,
what
would
have
been
the
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
i'm
asking
you
now,
why
as
a
matter
of
administration,
wasn't
it
an
arbitrary
administration
of
the
statute
to
restrict
the
available
drawing
power
of
women
to
ten
out
of
a
total
of
10,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
--
suppose
you
said
10
or
12,
suppose
i
give
you
15,
there's
no
suggestion
that
there
were
more
than
--
somewhere
around
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
let's
say
19,
i
said
two
digits,
19.
suppose
there
were
19
in
that,
i
want
to
know
why
with
so
limited
a
supply
of
women
and
presumably
the
legislation,
lest
we
suppose
that
women
are
a
desirable
ingredient
concept
in
the
jury
--
in
the
jury
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
alright.
so
that
that
was
as
a
policy
behind
the
statute
of
having
women
respecting
however
the
special
functions
of
historic
reasons
or
all
the
other
considerations
that
you
canvassed,
assuming
all
of
that,
it
limits
the
number
of
available
jurors.
i
want
to
know
why
the
system
was
so
administered
that
it
allowed
the
including
of
woman
in
a
jury
actually
drawn
with
so
small
result
on
the
basis
of
probability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
can
think
it
makes
a
difference
whether
you
have
10,000
out
of
which
to
draw
where
only
a
relatively
--
or
only
200
out
of
which
to
draw.
suppose
he
had
only
--
suppose
only
50
women
had
come
up
and
said,
“we
like
to
serve
on
juries.”
and
the
jury
commissioner
had
drawn
only
--
had
to
put
only
the
name
of
five
women
in
this
wheel,
would
that
be
alright?
could
it
be
--
this
is
allowed
in
arbitrary
choice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
there's
only
two.
i
don't
mean
to
argue
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
goes
to
a
certain
distance,
one
has
to
go
beyond
that,
i
don't
believe
in
that
argument,
that
mode
of
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
whether
a
system
which
inherently
by
experience
has
shown
to
lead
only
a
few
women
to
come
forward
to
be
ready
to
serve
as
jurors,
and
if
the
policy
of
the
state
is
to
have
women
on
jury,
that
is
the
policy
of
the
state,
restricted
though
it
is,
isn't
it,
whether
an
administration
which
arbitrarily
limits
to
so
smaller
chance
of
a
woman
being
on
a
jury
having
some
infirmity
of
its
own,
notwithstanding
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
only
a
handful
come
in
to
do
what,
to
serve?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
mr.
attorney,
in
the
actual
--
in
the
actual
life
as
far
as
criminal
prosecutions,
what
experience
can
you
give
to
the
court
as
the
presence
of
the
women
on
juries
in
the
past?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wanted
to
know
what
the
chief
justice
has
asked
you?
how
many
served
on
the
trial
jury?
it's
what
i
want
to
know,
in
the
county
of
yours,
in
capital
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
the
normal
(inaudible)
murder
--
certain
in
capital
cases
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
you
have
a
jury
of
six
in
--
what
you
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
12.
