mr.
ehrmann,
may
i
ask
you
please
sir.
after
the
1956
list
of
10,000
had
been
prepared
and
3000
of
them
had
been
we
will
say,
used
up
lessens
only
7000.
had
any
women
registered
for
jury
service
before
the
3000
names
were
put
back
in
to
bring
the
list
up
to
nine
--
to
10,000?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
that's
--
that's
alright.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
was
of
significance
to
my
way
of
thinking
because
suppose
the
administrators
of
the
jury
list
said
despite
the
fact
women
have
elected
to
serve
by
registering,
we're
not
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
it.
we'll
put
back
to
3000
all
men
and
leave
the
women
out.
that
might
very
well
be
a
systematic
discrimination
against
women,
but
if
there
weren't
any
women
who
had
elected
to
register,
it
couldn't
be
said,
could
it,
that
there
was
a
systematic
discrimination?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
but
there
60,000
men
who
are
eligible
you
say
and
only
10,000
men
and
women
on
this
list.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
the
wheel
as
i
would
call
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
there
might
be
some
disparity,
but
there
wasn't
an
exclusion
of
either
sex
from
the
wheel?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
know
what
the
mathematics
are.
it'd
be
218
to
64,000,
wouldn't
it?
if
218
women
who
have
registered
and
64,000
men
were
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
there
were
10
out
of
--
10
women
and
990
men
in
the
wheel.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
question
you're
talking
about
now,
if
i
may
say
so,
appears
to
me
as
answered
by
the
proposition
of
whether
there
is
an
exclusion,
isn't
it?
and
here
if
the
women
may
elect
to
serve
if
they
wish,
all
or
so
many
as
do,
none
were
excluded,
do
you
think
so?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
agree
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
suppose
the
population
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
there
may
be
admitted
some
inequality,
some
discrimination
(inaudible)
and
not
intentionally
done,
that's
alright,
don't
you
think?
