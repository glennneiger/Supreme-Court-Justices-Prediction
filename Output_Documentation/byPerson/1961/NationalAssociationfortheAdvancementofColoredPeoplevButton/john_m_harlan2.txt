do
you
have
a
paid
staff,
a
full-time
paid
staff?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
lawyers?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
it
be
that
what
you're
worried
about
was
that
you
didn't
know
what
the
right
route
of
review
was.
one
of
you
picked
the
district
court
and
the
other
picked
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
picked
the
supreme
court
so
you'd
cover
both
wickets.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
did
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
also
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
not
omission
of
any
portion
of
this
record
that
was
related
exclusively
with
the
fund,
that's
all
in
hand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
virginia
court
struck
that
statute
down.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john

justice
john
m.
harlan
are
those
cases
that
you
referred
to
that
struck
down
by
the
city
court
of
a
--
going
up
on
appeal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
virginia
court
is
directing
himself
only
to
those
cases
while
the
association
goes
to
people
and
not
what
people
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
people
and
ask
them
to
become
plaintiff
and
refer
it
to
the
lawyer
and
then
page
the
lawyer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
so
the
supreme
court
held
interpreting
the
statute
of
your
court.
