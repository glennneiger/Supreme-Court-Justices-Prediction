justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
why
--
i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
it
--
isn't
it
suppose
--
isn't
the
decision
of
the
virginia
courts
on
the
request
for
declaration
appealable
to
this
court,
reviewable
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
difficulty
arises
from
the
fact
that
it's
to
inquire
whether
it
was
assumed
that
the
mere
declaration
by
the
virginia
court
of
unconstitutionality,
insofar
as
it
affects
the
fund
--
i'll
ask
that
question
after
lunch.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
the
fund
is
a
new
york
corporation.
was
it
doing
business
in
virginia?
it
also
entered
--
was
it
licensed
to
do
business
or
whatever
is
required
by
virginia
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
a
litigant
before
the
virginia
supreme
court
when
the
question
--
when
these
issues
were
raised
before
it
by
proper
litigations.
it
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
not
an
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
gave
it
a
declaration.
now,
and
you
didn't
--
or
it
didn't
come
here.
are
you
also
in
conflict
with
the
fund?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
did
not
come
here
and
my
puzzlement
is
why
didn't
it
come
here,
if
under
the
notion
that
a
declaration
is
not
a
“case
of
controversy,”
this
court
has
decided
the
opposite
of
that
in
the
wallace
case
in
288
u.s.
because
the
reason
--
it
becomes
at
least
interesting,
if
not
important,
is
we
may
get
a
situation
[attempt
to
laughter]
where
the
virginia
court
now
has
construed
the
statute,
the
construction
is
binding
on
the
federal
court
as
it
is
on
this
court,
but
the
validity
or
invalidity
under
the
federal
constitution
is
of
course
open
to
the
federal
court
sitting
in
virginia
as
it
is
open
here
and
so
we
may
get
a
rather
embarrassing
situation.
i'm
not
saying
you
will
but
there
is
that
contingency
that
the
virginia
court
has
held
one
thing
and
the
district
court
may
hold
another
thing.
now,
would
you
enlighten
us
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
(inaudible)
--
no
suggestion
that
anybody
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
counsel
have
their
responsibility.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
matter
has
been
before
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
said
the
district
court
has
pronounced
some
views.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
did
want
to
say
if
by
chance
there's
a
misapprehension
or
a
non-apprehension
that
a
declaratory
judgment
may
also
come
here
subject
to
the
appropriate
condition,
but
this
court
decided
that
nearly
30
years
ago
in
288
u.s.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
they're
not
before
us
now
and
the
district
court
of
virginia
has
the
independent
duty,
at
least
there
is
before
the
district
court
of
virginia
now,
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
as
construed
by
the
virginia
court
in
re
--
as
it
relates
to
the
fund,
while
we're
considering
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
it
relates
to
the
naacp.
that's
the
situation,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
not
necessarily
--
not
necessarily.
the
facts
might
be
different.
that's
the
whole
point
of
this
strange
selection
of
routes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
is
--
they
are.
i
don't
know
enough
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
little
strange
for
us
to
go
out
of
the
way
and
pass
down
the
fund
when
the
fund
chose
not
to
come
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
i
won't
pursue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
may
make
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
might
might
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
ask
naacp
in
virginia
or
the
home
office?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
no
litigation
for
which
the
naacp
of
virginia
is
responsible
will
be
undertaking
without
consent
or
approval
or
authorization
by
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
what
you
said
thus
far,
am
i
to
infer
that
potential
litigants
would
come
to
the
naacp?
the
initiation
would
be
from
the
outside.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
--
does
the
record
uniform
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
be
specific
to
be
concrete
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
connected
successively
with
the
legal
aid
society
in
new
york
and
later
in
boston
and
there
was
--
there
were
from
time
to
time
meetings
held
into
the
community
that
there
is
such
an
organization
and
that
indigent
people
may
come
to
that
organization
at
the
stated
address
and
there
get
legal
advice
if
they
haven't
the
means
of
having
a
private
lawyer.
now,
does
that
describe
the
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter,
may
i
ask
you
to
read
or
refer
to
the
exact
words
of
the
statute,
violation
of
which
--
with
which
you
are
charged
or
which
you
are
in
charge
--
enjoined
not
to
violate.
you
used
several
phrases
and
i
want
to
know
what
the
statute
says
about
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
words
of
the
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
where
is
article
7?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
called
article
7,
it's
7
if
you'll
see
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
my
legal
aid
society
exempted
from
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
a
specific
--
i
mean
a
specific
organization?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
legal
aid
society.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
virginia
state
bar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
neither
apply
nor
would
you
come
under
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
didn't
--
you
weren't
approved,
so
you
don't
come
under
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
never
applied
and
you
don't
want
to
be
deemed
such.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
and
you're
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
all
events,
you
don't
come
within
the
exemption
because
you
didn't
come
within
the
procedure
for
exemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
(voice
overlap)
--
and
pay
the
fees
for
litigants
who
could
afford
to
pay,
is
that
important?
because
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then,
should
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
differ
from
a
legal
aid
society
in
that
you
do
not
help,
or
whatever,
you
do
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
do
business
with
indigent
litigants.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
a
perfectly
rich
man
can
come
to
you
(inaudible)
--
perfectly
--
i
don't
know
what
that
means,
but
a
financially
able
person
can
have
you
bear
the
cost
of
his
litigation,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
it
makes
a
difference.
i
just
want
to
get
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
some
members
of
the
law
school
of
the
university
of
virginia
have
as
a
collectivity,
the
law
school
think
it's
very
important
to
apprise
people
and
make
them
alert
to
and
the
vigorous
and
assertion
of
their
right
has
a
carefully
worked
out
program
of
making
speeches
all
over
the
commonwealth
telling
people
what
their
rights
are,
negroes
or
anybody
else,
i
mean,
any
other,
perhaps,
minority
groups
and
then
they
get
a
regular
business
to
do
this
throughout
the
academic
year,
teachers
all
over
virginia,
and
that's
all
they
do.
would
they
come
within
the
statute?
suppose
they
do
it
under
the
authority
of
the
university
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
are
you
prevented
from
doing
just
that
and
nothing
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
arguing
on
any
--
i'm
not
arguing
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
legal
interest.
i
just
want
to
know
what
this
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
i
suppose
i
happen
to
know
of
a
lawyer
in
virginia
whose
business,
as
a
matter
of
fact
(inaudible)
private
meetings,
he's
a
good
lawyer
and
most
of
activities
have
been
(inaudible).
now,
suppose
they
called
you
up
and
say,
“now,
we
can't
--
we're
not
this
so
and
so
in
such
and
such
a
place.”
so
there
are
other
lawyers
--
did
you
just
suggest
lawyers
or
if
they
go
to
legal
aid
society,
would
that
be
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
university
of
virginia
law
school
did
that,
they
would
come
within
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
also
by
your
own
statement,
there
are
some
additional
factors
in
the
record
as
to
you
which
are
not
in
my
hypothetical
case,
namely
that
you
actually
have
to
finance
these
lawyers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter,
you
said
to
enable
people
to
assert
or
vindicate
their
constitutional
rights,
you
used
the
words
“to
enable.”
now,
with
reference
to
that,
is
the
financial
position
of
a
person
who
seeks
to
assert
his
right
relevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
is.
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
position
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
unfamiliar
with
your
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
want
to
know
whether
if
a
person
says,
“yes,
these
are
my
rights.
these
are
the
rights
of
my,”
what
you
call
group,
i'm
not
sufficient
--
i'm
a
man
of
need,
but
i'm
not
sufficiently
interested
that
they're
the
burden
of
a
litigation.
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
position
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
the
state
may
not
say
that
if
a
man
is
in
a
position,
financially
able,
to
assert
his
constitutional
rights,
somebody
else
can't,
as
it
was
--
as
it
were
propellant
into
being
a
litigant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
haven't
asked
you
any
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
may
the
state
--
may
the
state
require
you
to
ask
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
are
--
because,
mr.
carter,
when
you
say
“constitutional
right,”
it's
the
constitutional
right
of
every
person,
white
or
colored,
jew,
gentile,
or
agnostic,
or
catholic
to
assert
his
rights
in
court
so
long
as
the
courts
are
open.
that's
his
constitutional
right.
now,
what
you're
asserting
here
may
apply,
though
not
as
vividly,
to
other
situations
and
i
just
want
to
know
whether
you're
asserting
that
an
organization
or
a
person
who
seeks
to
finance
the
assertion
of
legal
rights
may
be
barred
from
doing
that
by
the
state,
except
when
the
person
whose
rights
are
to
be
asserted
hasn't
the
financial
means
of
going
into
court
and
carrying
the
burden
of
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
saying
--
you're
not
saying
or
are
you
saying
that
the
state
of
virginia,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
is
singling
out
the
naacp
in
this
legislation.
are
you
saying
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
real
--
i
mean,
that's
a
real
equal
protection
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
are
saying
that,
that's
a
totally
different
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
every
criminal
case
involve
a
so-called
civil
rights
embedded
in
the
constitution
--
every
criminal
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
my
hypothetical
case,
mr.
wickham?
it's
--
to
me
not
a
(inaudible)
suggestion
but
some
members
of
the
university
of
virginia
law
school
might
be
interested
in
this
subject.
it's
not
too
fanciful
an
assumption,
is
it?
and
suppose
they
constitute
themselves,
the
committee
of
the
law
schools
to
awaken
negroes
in
the
state
to
their
rights
and
make
speeches
and
give
general
advice
and
also
say
they
have
a
list
of
lawyers
who
they
know
are
responsible
and
charge
small
fees
for
a
public
service
to
advice
indigent
negroes
who
wanted
to
assert
their
rights.
would
that
come
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
be
necessary
they
control
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mi
mean
that
--
that
isn't
a
matter
of
law.
that's
a
question
of
what
the
circumstance
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
they
would
or
wouldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
illinois
--
that's
precisely
the
ground
of
distinction
that
the
illinois
court
put.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
wasn't
true
there,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that's
the
distinction
that
the
illinois
case
took.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
they
were
not
controlling
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
saying.
that's
why
i
don't
see
why
you
say
it's
a
conclusive
presumption.
the
fellow
who
gives
advice
would
control
the
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
didn't
he--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
that
case,
did
they
say
that
was
illegal
in
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
one
of
the
rules
was
that
they
should
not
control
the
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
couldn't
solicit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
a
statewide
--
this
is
another
form
of
that
to
justice
stewart's
question,
have
you
of
statewide
civil
liberties
union
or
whatever
it's
called
or
rather
locality
that
have
legal
aid
society
in
virginia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
local
bar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
wickham,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
--
address
yourself
to
what
mr.
carter
claimed,
but
did
not
have
time
to
expand
and
argue
is
namely
that
whatever
maybe
the
justification
for
a
general
statute,
(inaudible)
for
soliciting
--
solicitation
of
litigation
that,
in
the
context
of
everything,
that's
particular
about
the
territory,
this
was
especially
directed
to
the
naacp
and,
therefore,
falls
as
a
clear
case
of
unequal
protection
of
the
law.
that
is
that
it
was
singled
out,
if
you
had
a
--
not
in
terms
but
in
fact.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
its
discrimination
in
its
enforcement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
there
is
discrimination
in
enforcement
then
there's
something
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
as
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
on
that
count
or
on
that
basis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
wanted
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
injunction
against
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
against
petitioner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
saying
the
state
hasn't
moved
against
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
brought
a
proceeding
in
the
district
court.
he
called
it
a
threat
because
of
this
overhanging
cloud
of
this
legislation
to
get
it
enjoined
and
then,
via
this
court,
they
were
remitted
to
getting
a
construction,
a
part
of
the
legislation
through
your
supreme
court.
that's
where
we
are
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
never
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
connection
with
their
series
of
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
said
they
want
a
declaration
and
they
say,
even
in
that
proceeding,
it
becomes
relevant,
i
doubt
they'll
say
something
about
it
but
i
thought
his
contention
was
that
that
was
central
contention
that
naacp
--
while
the
legislation
in
turn
is
general,
the
target
is
naacp.
if
that
is
so,
as
you
naturally
said,
that
would
be
bad,
wouldn't
it?
you
can't,
on
the
cover
of
general
law,
single
out
a
particular
enterprise
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
always
getting
paid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
get
into
cases
(inaudible)
they
get
into
cases
for
indigents
and
they
get
into
cases
by
consent,
as
justice
stewart's
application
to
get
started.
they
were
allowed
to
argue
that
they
hire
other
cases
for
the
consumer's
relief.
there's
--
a
lawyer
might
associate
himself,
but
i
had
a
very
sad
experience
(inaudible).
counsel
is
supposed
to
argue.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
did
think
“it's
perfectly
beyond
my
control.”
he
conducted
the
litigation
and
he
took
steps
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter,
please
tell
me
whether
this
is
a
fair
statement
of
what
your
argument
produce
in
itself
that
at
least
one
person
will
listen
to
you
closely,
namely
that
the
naacp
in
effect
--
mind
you,
in
effect
--
naacp
in
effect
is
trying
to
do
or
trying
to
bring
to
pass
the
protection
of
rights
which
the
state
itself
ought
to
see
to
it
that
they
are
protected
and
in
securing
those
rights
it
isn't
--
you
cannot
be
restricted
to
the
ordinary
rules,
the
ordinary
restrictions,
in
regard
to
the
kinds
of
litigation
applying
to
other
litigation,
plus,
the
power
of
this
court
to
oversee
decisions
that
do
not
protect
their
rights.
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
ordinarily
at
least
i'm
subject
to
correction,
but
i'd
always
assume
that
to
go
out
and
get
people,
induce
people
to
bring
litigation
and
conduct
their
litigation
for
them
and
pay
the
expenses
of
litigation
was
something
that
(inaudible)
are
not
allowed
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
i'm
--
therefore
you
--
that's
right
so
you
don't
disagree
with
what
i've
said
in
the
case.
