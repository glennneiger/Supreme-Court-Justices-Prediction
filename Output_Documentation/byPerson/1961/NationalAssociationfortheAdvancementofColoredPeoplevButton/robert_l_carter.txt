mr.
robert
l.
carter
as
we
understand
the
issue
in
this
case
which
i
will
attempt
to
set
out
at
the
outset,
is
whether
petitioner
who
is
engaged
in
a
course
--
a
regular
course
of
conduct
of
attempting
to
educate
the
public
in
respect
to
issues
of
racial
discrimination
and
which
encourages
negroes
to
assert
their
constitutional
rights
and
which
holds
itself
out
as
being
an
agency
which
will
aid
if
these
--
if
persons
come
forward
to
assert
these
rights
in
the
courts,
in
aiding
to
--
in
helping
provide
counsel,
paying
counsel
fees
and
costs.
and
whether
the
attorneys,
the
lawyers
who
are
associated
with
petitioner
in
these
efforts
and
which
handle
cases
of
this
kind,
whether
they,
both
petitioners
and
the
lawyers,
can
be
found
guilty
of
illegal
conduct
and
barred
from
these
activities
under
state
law.
we
contend
that
the
state
has
no
interest
to
protect,
in
this
regard,
has
no
power
to
make
such
activity
illegal
and
we
contend
that
in
doing
so,
as
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
has
held
in
construing
the
statute
which
is
now
before
the
court,
that
the
construction
of
the
statute
violates
due
process
and
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
case
arose
in
this
fashion
on
--
in
1956,
at
an
extra
session
of
the
general
assembly
of
virginia.
the
statute
which
is
now
here
before
the
court,
and
which
we
allege
is
unconstitutional,
was
enacted
along
with
some
five
or
six
other
statutes
which
petitioner
charges
were
anti-naacp
statutes
and
several
statutes
and
laws
dealing
explicitly
with
the
issue
of
school
desegregation.
these
were
passed,
and
this
was
a
part
of
the
state's
massive
resistance
plan
as
they
called
it
to
desegregation
in
virginia.
petitioner,
feeling
that
these
statutes
were
designed
to
destroy
it
as
an
agent
as
--
in
its
activities
in
virginia,
brought
suit
in
the
federal
court
against
five
statutes,
i
think
two
of
them
dealt
with
legislative
investigation
committees
and
these
we
could
not
--
we
did
not
feel
we
could
attack,
but
the
prior
statute
would
--
they
were
charged
with
being
unconstitutional
in
the
federal
court.
in
the
federal
court,
three
of
the
statutes
were
struck
down
and
two
of
the
statutes
were
considered
too
vague
for
interpretation.
and
as
the
court
knows,
on
appeal
here,
the
three
statutes
that
the
court
had
struck
down,
but
that
judgment
was
vacated
and
remanded
on
the
ground
that
the
--
both
statutes
at
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
should've
been
given
an
opportunity
to
construe
the
statute
before
the
federal
court
acted.
we
are
now
dealing
with
the
--
with
one
of
the
two
statutes
which
was
not
before
the
court
in
naacp
versus
harrison
which
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
they
are
now
pending
before
the
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
at
the
present
time.
two
of
the
--
the
other
two
statutes
were
not
touched
and
these
are
the
--
one
of
these
is
the
statutes
we're
dealing
with
at
the
present
time.
petitioner
brought
action
in
the
state
court
pursuant
to
the
instructions
of
the
court,
attacking
the
validity
of
these
two
statutes,
and
i
will
now
only
deal
with
one
of
them,
the
instant
statute
because
as
you
know,
the
second
statute,
chapter
36,
was
struck
down.
so
that
i
will
talk
from
now
on
as
if
only
one
statute
was
involved
in
this
instance.
there's
no
need
to
advert
at
all
to
chapter
36.
the
petitioner
took
the
view
that
the
instant
statute,
one,
did
not
apply
to
its
activities
or
the
activities
of
any
other
counsel
associated
with
it,
and
asked
for
a
construction
of
the
statute
to
that
effect.
if
the
statute
were
construed
as
applying
to
its
activities
or
the
activities
of
counsel
who
are
associated
with
it,
petitioner
took
the
view
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
should
be
struck
down.
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
held
that
it
applied
to
petitioner's
activities
and
that
in
fact,
the
record
disclosed
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
petitioner
was
in
fact
engaged
in
what
they
call
the
illegal
fomenting
and
starting
up
of
litigation
and
the
solicitation
of
legal
business
in
violation
of
chapter
33
and
that
counsel
who
were
--
who
took
cases
with
knowledge
that
they
were
being
financed
by
petitioner
was
also
guilty
of
malpractice
and
should
--
will
be
subject
to
disbarment.
the
statute
itself
is
set
out
on
pages
2
to
5
of
the
--
of
our
brief
in
chief,
and
the
italicized
sections
of
the
statute
are
the
new
matter
which
had
been
added
in
the
1956
session.
this
statute
had
been
codified
as
it
had
been
in
existence
sometime
before.
ordinary
statutes
like
--
which
i've
--
they
call
it
running
and
capping,
but
i
think
it's
--
we
can,
at
least
i
will
use
the
term
bar
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
--
i
have
never
heard
of
it
either
but
i
gather,
from
the
description
that
what
it
means
is
that
a
person,
an
agent
of
an
attorney
is
a
runner
to
secure
business
for
him
and
running
and
capping.
i
don't
--
other
than
the
running,
i
don't
understand
what
the
rest
of
it
means.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
i
suppose
so.
the
--
as
you
will
note
the
italicized
section
from
the
beginning
now
at
the
bottom
of
page
3
in
section
6,
the
italicized
sections
are
the
new
matter
which
was
added
to
the
statute.
and
under
this
statute,
it
is
now
made
a
malpractice
for
the
acceptance
by
an
attorney
of
the
--
of
an
employment,
compensation
of
cost
from
any
person
or
organization
with
knowledge
that
the
organization
has
violated
the
provisions
of
article
7.
and
in
article
7,
which
is
on
page
4,
a
runner
or
capper
is
now
described
as
not
only
being
a
person
acting
as
an
agent
for
an
attorney
but
as
an
--
acting
as
an
agent
for
any
organization
which
employs
or
retains
or
compensates
an
attorney
in
connection
with
any
judicial
proceedings
in
which
the
organization
is
not
a
party
and
has
no
pecuniary
right
or
liability
in
the
solicitation
or
procurement
of
business
for
such
attorney
or
for
the
organization
in
connection
with
any
judicial
proceedings
within
which
such
attorney
or
person
is
employed,
retained,
or
compensated.
now,
the
facts
on
which
the
court
reaches
the
conclusion
that
petitioner
is
engaged
--
is
guilty
of
violating
this
act
are
roughly
and
briefly
these,
and
i
might
add
that
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
these
facts
were
facts
that
were
adduced
in
the
federal
court
in
naacp
versus
patty
which
was
on
appeal
here,
and
it
was
the
record
that
was
adduced
there,
plus,
the
fact
that
in
the
state
court,
additional
evidence
was
taken.
these
were
combined
and
this
constituted
the
record
before
the
state
court,
upon
which
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
made
its
findings.
the
facts
disclose
that
the
petitioner
is
a
nonprofit
new
york
membership
corporation
and
that
it
has
several
subunits
in
virginia
described
as
branches
and
a
state
unit
in
virginia
which
is
called
a
virginia
state
conference.
it
disclosed
that,
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
that
one
of
the
areas
in
which
the
organization
operates
in
virginia
is
to
encourage
negroes
to
assert
their
constitutional
rights
in
courts
and
not
only
does
it
encourage
them,
but
the
organization
itself,
holds
itself
out
as
being
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
help
persons
to
bring
their
matters
before
the
court
and
to
finance
litigation
whom
it
is
brought.
it
is
conceded
that
the
petitioner
does
not
go
out
for
people,
but
in
terms
of
the
--
of
its
publications
and
writings
and
so
forth,
it
does
attempt
to
encourage
negroes
when
necessary
to
assert
these
rights
and
says
that
it
will
finance
them,
if
someone
comes
forward.
and
as
a
part
of
the
virginia
--
the
state
organization,
there
is
a
group
of
lawyers
which
constitute
a
legal
committee
which
in
this
context
is
called
a
legal
staff
and
these
group
of
lawyers
are
volunteers,
but
they
are
elected
each
year
by
the
state
unit
as
a
working
unit
of
the
--
of
--
they
have
a
chairman
and
most
of
the
litigation
in
virginia,
if
not
all
of
the
litigations
in
virginia
in
the
area
of
civil
rights,
which
petitioner
finances
are
handled
by
these
attorneys.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
full-time
paid
staff
which
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
of
lawyers,
yes,
sir,
which
this
paid
staff
of
lawyers
is
in
new
york.
there
are
no
full-time
paid
lawyers
operating
outside
the
new
york
area.
it
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
this
--
there
is
an
independent
organization
which
is
not
before
the
court,
which
is
called
the
naacp
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
which
is
separate
from
the
--
from
petitioner.
and
this
organization
did
have
a
--
what
is
called
a
regional
counsel
in
the
name
--
in
the
name
of
mr.
sparks-robinson
who
was
a
resident
in
virginia
and
who
was
paid
and
retained
to
handle
the
litigation
which
(inaudible)
act
as
counsel
in
cases
which
they
had.
now,
i
must
confess
that
the
two
organizations
have
operated
together
and
jointly,
but
i
didn't
advert
to
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
naacp
is
the
only
organization
now
before
the
court
in
this
instance.
the
way
that
the
lawyers
who
operate
in
virginia
are
--
handle
litigations,
one,
they
do
not
work
full
time;
two,
they're
volunteers.
they
do
not
get
paid
for
anything,
except,
they
do
receive
a
per
diem
when
they're
actually
engaged
in
any
litigation
which
the
state
unit
or
the
national
unit
decides
that
for
reasons
that
it
will
sponsor.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
is
paid
by
the
state
unit
in
this
instance.
generally,
it
can
be
--
help
can
come
from
the
national
unit
in
--
help
can
come
from
the
national
unit,
the
main
petitioner
here,
but
most
of
these
cases
which
are
referred
to
in
the
record,
the
money
was
--
or
funds
were
raised
by
the
state
units
and
used
to
pay
lawyers.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
this
is
in
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
what
the
court
was
doing
--
was
making
a
distinction
between
the
legal
defense
fund
and
petitioner
organization.
this
is
not
true.
both
organizations
turn
to
finance
the
litigation
and
so
forth.
the
fund
operates
differently.
it
is
a
tax-exempt
organization
and
the
organization
now
before
the
--
before
you
is
not.
and
it
handles
--
it
is
involved
exclusively
in
the
issue
of
legal
activity,
whereas,
this
organization
is
involved
not
only
in
legal
activity
but
also
in
political
activity
as
well
and,
for
that
reason,
it
is
not
tax-exempt.
but
i
--
there
has
been
no
real
delineation
of
the
kinds
of
work
that
the
two
will
do
in
the
field
of
litigation.
they
both
do
engage
in
it
and,
for
that
reason,
this
is
why
that
both
organizations
felt
that
this
statute
was
a
threat
to
their
existence.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
was
a
suit
that
--
it
originally
arose
as
a
suit
for
an
injunction
before
statutory
united
states
district
court
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
under
the
doctrine
of
federal
abstention,
we
were
sent
over
to
the
state
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
fund
was
a
plaintiff,
but
the
fund
asked
only
for
declaratory
judgment
and
we
asked
for
an
injunction
on
that.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
i
think
there
was
a
difference
in
procedure.
the
fund,
being
sent
over
to
the
state
court,
asked
merely
for
a
construction
of
the
statute
in
the
light
of
its
view
as
to
its
constitutionality.
the
fund
then
was
going
back
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
it's
now
there
for
an
interpretation
now
of
its
pleadings
as
to
the
statute's
constitutionality
in
light
of
the
declaratory
judgment
which
the
state
courts
have
answered.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
fund
was
of
the
view
that
it
could
not
ask
for
a
review
here
because
it
had
not
asked
that
the
statute
be
struck
down.
it
therefore
felt
that
it
had
to
go
back
to
the
united
states
district
court
or
the
united
states
district
court
which
had
jurisdiction
which
had
retained
jurisdiction
to
now
interpret
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
constitutional
interpretation
and
construction
which
had
been
given
to
the
statute
by
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
but
that
--
that's
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
are
both
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
are
both
doing
the
same
thing,
but
in
--
now,
it's
in
view
of
the
route
which
has
been
taken.
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
confusion
about,
when
a
doctrine
of
federal
abstention
is
applied
as
to
what
one
may
do,
and
what
occurred
was
that
the
fund
felt
that
the
route
it
could
take
was
to
seek
or
declare
--
a
declaration,
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
light
of
the
construction
and
constitutionality
it
was
seeking.
and
having
gotten
that
construction,
having
the
state
court
having
construed
the
statute,
with
the
federal
court
having
jurisdiction,
it
felt
that
it
had
to
go
back
before
the
state
court
--
before
the
federal
court
and,
there,
apply
for
the
relief
which
the
federal
court
said
it
could
not
give
because
the
statute
was
too
vague
and
ambiguous.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
in
all
fairness
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
understand.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
understand
the
--
but
i'm
trying
to
answer
the
question.
i
really
cannot
and
should
not
speak
for
the
fund.
all
i
can
say
is
that
in
terms
of
how
this
litigation
progressed
that
there
was
a
difference
in
concept
of
how
it
should
be
pursued.
and
we
took
the
view
that
we
should
ask
for
an
injunction
as
well
as
a
declaratory
judgment
and
that
we
should
appeal
the
judgment
if
it
went
against
this
court.
they
took
a
different
view
and
the
issue
--
the
case
in
terms
of
their
--
is
now
pending
before
the
united
states
district
court
and
the
united
states
district
court
i
think
i
might
add
took
the
view
that
they
should
have
appealed
to
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
is
not
pending,
awaiting
the
determination
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it
announced
it
in
open
court,
not
in
terms
of
an
opinion
and
it
is
now
holding
the
matter
awaiting
the
determination
of
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
what
happened
was
that
we
--
there
was,
as
i
indicated,
a
disagreement
or
rather
difference
as
to
what
the
right
route
or
correct
view
was
and
we
took
this
route.
that's
the
best
answer
i
can
give
to
you.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
might
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
might
say
that
the
--
at
the
present
time,
the
district
court
is
awaiting
the
decision
by
this
court
and
what
of
the
decision
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
is
taken
by
this
court,
the
district
court
will
of
course
be
bound
by
it.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
might
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
facts
which
are
crucial
to
a
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
even
though
the
organizations
are
different,
the
fact
picture
is
substantially
the
same.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
the
cases
were
consolidated
and
we
tried
to
gather
on
the
same
set
of
facts.
the
only
difference
in
the
facts
is
in
respect
to
the
corporate
structure
of
the
fund
as
contra
--
distinct
to
the
corporate
structure
of
petitioner.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
and
this
--
and
that
record
is
also
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right,
sir,
insofar
as
it
relates
to
this
particular
statute.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
it
employ
--
it
does
--
the
fund,
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
no
membership
and
the
naacp
does.
it
has
no
chapters
or
branches
that
are
operating.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
and
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
and
the
--
and
this
organization
does.
it
had
a
salaried
employee
who
was
no
longer
employed.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
it
had
at
the
time
this
record
was
closed,
but
that
salaried
lawyer
is
not
--
now
no
longer
employed
in
virginia
and
he
was
--
that
lawyer
was
also
a
part
of
the
legal
committee
of
the
petitioner
in
virginia
for
which
--
which
i'm
about
to
attempt
to
explain.
now,
as
i
attempted
to
indicate
before,
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
fomenting
and
starting
up
litigation
and
soliciting
business
and
that
the
lawyers
who
took
cases
which
petitioner
sponsored
could
be
charged
under
the
statute
with
barbarity
and
be
disbarred.
now,
the
issues,
it
seems
to
me,
or
rather
the
--
i
think
i
have
attempted
to
explain
what
the
facts
are,
except
to
attempt
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
how
the
--
a
particular
lawsuit
--
how
the
petitioner
gets
involved
in
a
particular
lawsuit.
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
record
that
the
petitioner
would
become
involved
in
a
lawsuit
in
several
ways.
one,
a
negro
who
felt
that
his
civil
rights
had
been
violated
might
come
to
the
office
of
the
state
--
the
state
office
and
talk
to
the
executive
secretary
and
say
that
“i
believe
this
is
a
problem
of
discrimination
which
the
petitioner
should
handle.”
he
would
--
the
officer
of
the
state
office,
the
salaried
employee
would
refer
him
to
one
of
the
lawyers
on
the
state
conference
legal
committee.
and
if
there
was
a
determination
that
the
matter
is
one
which
came
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
petition,
the
kind
of
cases
it
handled,
then
the
chairman
of
the
committee
would
take
it
up
with
the
president
of
the
state
office
and,
if
they
agreed,
then
these
funds
--
then
funds
from
the
state
office
would
be
forthcoming
to
help
in
financing
the
litigation
through
the
courts
or
as
happened
in
most
of
the
instances
in
the
particular
case
which
are
before
us
--
which
are
before
the
court,
the
people
in
particular
localities
would
go
directly
to
these
lawyers
and
say
that
“we
have
a
case
involving
school
desegregation
or
some
other
matter
and
we
would
like
to
have
this
matter
litigated
in
our
behalf.”
this
lawyer
would
then
request
of
the
naacp
whether
or
not
it
would
sponsor
the
litigation
and,
if
it
did
--
if
it
agreed,
then
of
course
it
would
sponsor
it
and
all
the
fees
and
expenses
of
the
litigation
would
be
handled
and
paid
for
by
the
organization.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
naacp
in
virginia
and
in
the
home
office
as
well.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
what
i
meant
was
that,
in
terms
of
the
--
i
thought
you
asked
me
whether
this
would
be
that
the
matter
would
be
financed
by
the
state
office
or
the
home
office
and
i
was
indicating
that
it
could
be
financed
by
both.
the
decision
as
to
whether
the
case
is
going
to
be
undertaken
is
generally
made
locally,
not
by
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
now
i'm--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
record
is
uniform
on
that
and
it's
clear
on
that
and
i
think
that
it
is
conceded
by
the
defendants
that
this
is
--
by
the
respondents
that
this
is
so.
i
attempted
at
the
outset
to
indicate
of
course
that
the
--
and
in
all
honesty
i
must
say
that
the
organization
does
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
goes
out
and
it
encourages
people
to
--
it
attempts
to
tell
people
what
their
believes,
their
rights
are
and
encourages
negroes
to
test
the
validity
--
the
invalidity
of
various
forms
of
racial
discrimination
and
it
does
indicate
that
if
someone
does
come
forward
that
it
will
assist
that
this
ought
to
be
a
part
of
the
picture,
but
we
do
not,
and
i
think
it
is
conceded
that
we
do
not
go
out
and
ask
people
to
come
forward
and
be
plaintiffs
in
particular
lawsuits.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
describes
the
--
that
describes
our
situation.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
now,
i'm
sorry.
i
think
i
spoke
too
fast.
i
don't
agree
that
you
are
bound
by
the
facts
as
they
are
found
by
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals.
i
think
that
you
may,
and
you
may
--
not
only
you
may,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
must
reevaluate
the
facts
and
evaluate
the
record
for
yourself
in
determining
whether
or
not
these
facts
are
--
if
the
facts
do
constitute
a
violation
of
the
constitution
or
the
statute.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
so,
except
for
the
--
our
hesitancy,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
is
the
fact
that
you
have
two
courts.
you
have
two
courts
that
have
made
findings
of
facts
here.
you
have
the
united
states
district
court
and
you
have
the
state
court
and
on
virtually
the
same
evidence,
they
have
come
to
different
conclusions
as
to
what
the
facts
are.
so
that
i
think
that
the
task
--
the
question
that
you
asked
me
is
not
--
it's
a
little
more
difficult
than
merely
following
the
state
procedure
on
what
the
state
has
found
on
virtually
the
same
facts.
now,
these
may
be
conclusions,
but
on
virtually
the
same
facts.
the
united
states
district
court
found
that
we
--
that
the
petitioner
was
not
engaged
in
stirring
up
and
fomenting
litigation
or
soliciting
business
for
lawyers
as
the
term
is
understood,
but
on
these
same
facts
or
practically
the
same
facts
which
i
will
tell
you
what's
the
--
and
i
will
show
you
the
differences
that
i
see
in
them,
the
state
court
reached
the
contrary
conclusion.
now,
it
can
be
said,
of
course,
that
these
are
conclusions
of
law
and
not
findings
of
facts,
but
in
any
rate
they
reached
different
conclusions
as
to
what
the
record
showed
in
terms
of
the
evidence.
now,
there
was
--
there
were
differences
in
the
evidence
before
the
state
court.
the
entire
record
which
was
before
the
district
court
was
before
the
state
court,
but
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
evidence
shown
that
in
the
city
of
norfolk
and
in
charlottesville
and
in
arlington,
that
some
of
the
people
whom
the
petitioner
had
assisted
in
litigation
were
not
indigents,
that
they
had
property
and
i
think
that
the
--
that
they
have
--
this
list
is
appended
to
the
brief
of
the
appellee.
this
was
not
before
the
district
court.
there
was
also
the
introduction
of
some
documents
which
indicated
that
the
state
organization
had
sent
out
directives
to
the
various
branches
which
in
effect
was
attempt
--
just
telling
them
the
effect
of
this
--
of
the
supreme
court
decision
in
1954,
asking
them
to
petition
their
school
boards
to
voluntarily
desegregate
their
schools,
advising
them
to
go
out
and
get
people
to
sign
petition
and
to
attempt
to
work
with
the
school
boards,
etcetera,
to
desegregate
the
schools
and
also
advising
them
that
the
--
if
the
school
boards
did
not
act,
then
there
was
time
to
file
a
lawsuit.
now,
these
were
--
these
were
the
differences
--
the
only
differences
in
the
fact.
the
--
that
fact
was
before
the
state
court
and
it
was
not
before
the
district
court,
although
i
might
say
that
the
petitioner
had
took
the
position
in
the
district
court
and
it's
taken
the
position
all
throughout
this
litigation
that
it
does
not
regard
itself
as
a
legal
aid
society
and
it
does
not
--
it
has
not
looked
into
the
financial
ability
of
the
people
that
it
supports
to
pay.
it
also
does
not
regard
itself
as
a
negro
defense
agency
and
does
not
take
each
and
every
case
that
a
negro
comes
up
and
indicates
that
he
has
been
denied
his
civil
rights.
there
is
a
category
of
cases
which
it
does
take
and
it
does
take
cases
in
which
an
issue
of
racial
discrimination
is
involved,
the
determination
of
which
it
believes
the
petition
will
affect
a
large
number
of
negroes
as
a
class.
and
since
1950,
it
has
stated
that
it
will
not
handle
any
litigation
unless
it
involves
a
direct
attack
on
the
validity
of
racial
discrimination
itself
or
racial
segregation
itself.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
on
phrase
--
on
page
3
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
page
3
of
petitioner's
brief,
i'm
sorry,
in
paragraph
6,
the
italicized
language
charges
the
attorneys
who
are
associated
with
us
of
malpractice.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
because
of
the
fact
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
they
accept
employment
and
compensation
from
an
organization
which
is
guilty
of
violating
the
provisions
of
article
7.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
article
7
is
down
below
on
page
4.
in
article
7,
the
italicized
words
again
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
article
7
is
on
page
4.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
do
you
mean
article
7?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
one
is
for
instance
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
representation
in
54-78
your
honor
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but,
they
call
it
--
it's
called
article
7,
where
it
describes
a
runner
as
a
--
a
capper
as
a
person
who
is
an
agent
or
attorney
or
for
any
person
or
organization
which
would
be
a
--
which
employs,
retains,
or
compensates
any
attorney
at
law
in
connection
with
any
judicial
proceedings
in
which
the
organization
is
not
a
party
in
which
it
has
no
pecuniary
right
or
liability.
we
were
charged
with
being
in
violation
of
that
provision
and
that
this
was
a
part
that
in
doing
this,
we
were
soliciting
business
for
this
attorney
which
we
--
for
whom
we
compensate.
now,
this
is
what
we
--
this
is
what
we
are
specifically
charged
with.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
legal
aid
society
was
exempted
from
the
provision
of
the
statute
in
chapter
36,
which
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
--
a
legal
aid
society
which
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
which
is
approved
by
the
virginia
state
bar.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
and
this
was
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
and
this
was
specifically
exempted
from
--
there
were
several
statutes.
i'm
sorry,
but
there
were
several
statutes,
one
was
33
and
one
was
35
which
was
here
before.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
the
court
specifically
held
that
we
are
not
a
legal
aid
society
and
its
--
in
terms
of
its
opinion
and
because
the
fact
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think
that
--
i
don't
know
whether
i'd
go
so
far
as
not
want
to
be
deemed
such,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
i
think
that
the
legal
aid
society,
as
we
understand
it,
is
one
that
its
help
is
dependent
upon
the
income
of
the
person
as
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
virginia
court
struck
that
statute
down
but
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
virginia
law,
which
specifically
exempts
the
legal
aid
society,
and
in
making
these
new
provisions,
they
made
sure
that
they
did
not
strike
down
this
kind
of
thing.
there
is
another
statute
which
involves,
which
is
chapter
34.
now,
we
think
that
--
and
i
might
briefly
try
to
make
my
contentions,
we
take
the
view
that
the
construction
of
this
particular
statute,
in
being
applied
to
us,
that
what
the
petitioner
is
doing
constitutes
the
illegal
fomenting
of
litigation
and
the
starting
up
of
litigation
and
that
the
solicitation
of
business
for
lawyers,
we
contend
that
this
is
an
arbitrary
construction
of
the
fomenting
of
litigation,
of
the
term
“fomenting
litigation
and
solicitation”
and
also,
we
contend
that
the
construing
of
the
fact
that
lawyers
who
are
associated
with
us,
with
petitioner,
who
handled
cases
are
guilty
of
malpractice,
that
this
is
also
arbitrary
and
is
a
violation
of
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
we
would
be
arguing
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
since
--
if
a
statute
which
was
straightforward,
a
statute
such
as
this,
we
would
be
concerned
as
to
whether
the
statute
applied
to
the
kind
of
activity
in
which
we
engaged.
and,
having
attempted
to
show
the
kind
of
activity
in
which
we
engage
and
bring
that
before
the
court,
with
the
court
having
made
a
specific
finding
that
our
activities
come
within
the
statute
and
are
violative,
we
would
have
--
necessarily
be
forced
to
contend
that
it
was
unconstitutional
because
i
think
the
--
without
regard
to
the
fact
that
this
was,
as
we
contend
it
is
a
racial
statute,
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
has
held
that
our
activities
come
within
its
order
and
are
illegal
and
i
think
that
whether
it
was
started
out
being
racial
or
eventually
came
--
became
racial
that
we
are
affected
by
it
and
we
would
therefore,
have
to
contest
it.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
will.
i'll
attempt
to
do
that.
i
--
it
seems
to
us
that
they
have
found
that
the
organization
itself,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
--
as
i've
attempted
to
explain,
encourages
people
to
assert
their
rights,
that
it
offers
legal
assistance
and
counsel
and
pays
lawyer's
fees,
the
court
has
specifically
found
that
this
constitutes
the
unlawful
solicitation
of
business
for
lawyers
and
that
illegal
fomenting
and
starting
up
of
litigation
and
it
has
found
that
the
lawyers
who
are
engaged
in
it
are
guilty
of
malpractice.
we
contend
that
this
violates
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
lawyers
who
handle
cases
which
petitioner
--
for
which
the
petitioner
pays,
for
which
he
pay
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
pays
the
legal
expenses
and
so
forth
that
these
lawyers
are
guilty
of
malpractice
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
-
and
are
subject
to
disbarment.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
--
and
let
me
add
one
other
point.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
this
has
been
--
that
this
has
been
shown,
if
the
court
please,
but
that
the
statute
does
not
necessarily
reach
that
point.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
mean
the
opinion
goes
beyond
that.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
do
not
investigate
and
determine
whether
a
person
has
the
means
before
we
determine
whether
that
assistance
will
be
given.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
only
issue
that
we're
involved
in,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
our
determination
is
whether
the
case
involves
racial
discrimination
and
whether
it's
determination
of
having
effect
upon
negroes
as
a
class.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
yes,
i
take
that
position.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
let
me
try
to
answer
it
this
way.
there
are
two
things
i
think
that
make
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
due
process
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
due
process
and
equal
protection.
now
equal
protection
is
--
it
will
be
a
little
shorter
for
me
to
answer.
the
statute
forbids
an
organization
such
as
ours
from
engaging
in
this
kind
of
activity
because
it
has
no
pecuniary
right
or
liability
in
the
outcome
of
the
litigation.
we
think
that
this
--
what
this
means,
as
we
understand
the
opinion,
is
that
commercial
--
a
commercial
concern
which
had
a
pecuniary
right
or
liability
may
do
the
things
that
we
are
condemned
from
doing
and
that
therefore,
insofar
as
we
--
we
are
not
interested
--
we
have
no
interest
in
the
or
no
--
we
have
no
monetary
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
litigation.
it's
an
interest
in
the
civil
rights,
etcetera,
of
the
group.
we
think
that
this
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
it
has
no
relation
in
our
judgment
to
make
this
distinction
to
the
integrity
of
the
bar
and
the
protection
of
the
judicial
process
which
is
the
only
objective
that
we
concede
that
the
state
may
have
in
enacting
and
forbidding
the
kinds
of
activities
that
we
do
in
this
context.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
with
reference
to
that.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
insofar
as
the
organization
is
concerned
and
insofar
as
its
members
are
concerned,
since
in
effect,
what
this
provision
will
do
will
make
their
right
to
group
together
and
advocate
and
carryout
a
program
which
the
association
has
carried
out,
this
of
course
--
this
of
course
does
strike,
we
think,
that
their
right
of
--
rights
under
the
first
amendment
which
is
also
involved
in
the
due
process
clause.
we
also
feel
that
in
terms
of
the
construction
of
what
solicitation
is,
we
do
not
feel
that
in
any
fair
and
reasonable
construction,
normally
as
these
terms
are
understood,
that
our
activities
or
petitioner's
activities
can
be
so
classified.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
not.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
not.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
are
not
prevented
from
--
at
the
present
time,
we
are
not
prevented
from
doing
that.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
may,
as
i
understand
the
opinion
below,
we
may
still
go
out
and
encourage
people
to
assert
their
rights,
etcetera,
but
when
we
get
to
the
point
that
the
people
come
and
ask
and
request
legal
assistance
and
ask
and
request
us
to
finance
their
litigation,
we
are
then,
if
we
do
that,
we
are
--
we
become
guilty
of
soliciting
business
for
lawyers
and
the
lawyers
become
guilty
of
malpractice.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
as
you
--
we
think
that
--
as
for
the
opinion
that's
been
interpreted,
we
can
make
no
suggestion
for
lawyers
because
of
the
fact
that
we
would
then
be
soliciting
business
for
particular
--
not
only
for
our
lawyers
which
has
been
done,
but
also
for
particular
attorneys.
now,
i
think
that
once
we
have
a
list
and
have
a
list
of
lawyers
that
we
would
recommend,
for
example,
that
would
come
within
that
prohibition
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
i
must
add
that
i
believe
that
our
activity
was
condemned
because
of
the
fact
that
the
kind
of
litigation
--
in
the
kind
of
litigation
which
we
were
involved.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
would
be
--
i
think
i
have
confused
you.
i
haven't
made
myself
clear
about
the
lawyer.
i
think
that
in
that
kind
of
case,
we
would
be
forbidden,
but
what
is
forbidden
is
the
lawyers
who
handle
litigation
for
the
--
in
which
we
sponsor
are
handling
a
litigation
for
particular
person,
for
example,
a
person
--
a
parent
--
a
child
wants
to
go
to
school
has
been
denied
because
of
race,
a
case
to
require
the
school
board
to
admit
them
to
the
school.
the
lawyer
handles
that
litigation,
the
litigation
is
financed
by
petitioner.
petitioner
pays
the
cost
of
expenses
and
a
per
diem
for
the
lawyer,
that
would
be
forbidden
and
if
this
were
a
case
involving
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
would
be
forbidden
from
doing
that.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
insofar
as
it
relates
to
our
activities,
they
have
so
held.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
our
activities
involve
the
--
any
case
in
virginia
which
--
in
which
a
person
were
denied
the
right
to
attend
a
particular
school
because
of
race,
we
would
--
and
if
we
pay
the
lawyer
who
would
handle
litigation,
we
would
be
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
this
is
--
what
was
struck
down
--
the
other
statute
--
the
other
was
that
you
couldn't
pay
unless
you
were
related
by
blood
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
etcetera.
that
has
been
struck
down.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
simple
matter
of
paying
--
or
paying
for
the
litigation
when,
as
they
found
that
we
--
that
the
litigation
is
being
handled
by
a
particular
group
of
lawyers
who
are
associated
with
us,
that
this
has
been
struck
down.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
they
said
that
because
--
they
said
that
we
had
no
pecuniary
right
or
liability
in
the
case
and
this
is
in
the
statute.
they
said
that
we
were
soliciting
illegal
business
for
lawyers
and
i
hesitated
on
your
term,
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
correct,
the
use
of
the
term
“solicitation.”
as
i
understand
the
term
“solicitation,”
for
example,
would
be
that
if
a
particular
group
of
person
were
out
getting
business
for
lawyers
for
which
the
individual
himself
paid
and
therefore
enriched
the
attorney.
this
is
not
the
situation
in
our
particular
case.
what
occurs
is
that
the
--
i'm
sorry,
what
occurs
is
that
the
plaintiff
who
is
concerned
about
his
civil
rights
will
go
to
a
lawyer
or
someone
and
the
financing
of
the
litigation
would
come
and
the
payment
of
the
lawyer
would
come
from
the
organization
to
enable
the
particular
person
to
carry
the
case
through
the
courts
and
to
this
court
if
--
eventually
this
court
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
i
am
asserting
that
in
the
context
in
which
--
in
a
particular
context
of
the
lit
--
of
the
activities
in
which
we
are
engaged.
you
must
remember,
mr.
justice
black,
that
we're
engaged
in
a
--
i
don't
say
this
broadly,
i
have
to
limit
it
to
what
the
kinds
of
activities
that
we
were
engaged
in.
the
--
we're
engaged
in
an
activity
involving
an
issue
of
racial
discrimination
and
segregation.
we
are
seeking
in
this
to
have
negroes
assert
their
rights.
we
in
fact
--
and
what
the
state
here
is
doing
is
saying
that
we
cannot
do
this,
although
they
have
a
constitutional
obligation
on
their
own
to
afford
the
constitutional
rights
which
we
are
attempting
to
have
people
assert
in
the
courts
and
have
it
declared.
we
think
that
the
state
cannot
forbid
this
kind
of
activity
or
doing
that
on
the
grounds
of
any
policy
or
the
integrity
of
the
bar,
etcetera,
because
we
think
that
the
facts,
in
effect,
belie
that
what
is
happening
in
this
kind
of
situation
is
any
threat
to
the
integrity
of
the
bar
at
all.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
--
i
agree.
i
think
that
this
would
be
our
position.
i
don't
believe
that
a
state
has
a
blanket
right
to
prevent,
as
you
indicated,
sir,
the
stirring
up
of
litigation
or
the
--
it
had
--
there
has
to
be
some
basis
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
litigation
it
could
prevent
from
stirring
up
and
the
kinds
of
things
that
it
can
do.
what
is
really
happening
in
this
case
is
that
the
prevention
of
our
bringing
--
or
our
aiding
people
and
bringing
the
--
their
cases
before
the
court
is
what
in
effect
is
happening
is
that
the
state
of
virginia
would
be
preventing
negroes
from
--
in
denying
from
seeking
to
test
the
validity
of
their
action
which
amounts
to
racial
discrimination
and
therefore
leave
their
policy
free
from
the
scrutiny
of
the
court.
we
think
they
cannot
do
this
and
we
think
that
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
that
this
is
a
violation
of
our
constitutional
rights
as
this
statute
has
been
interpreted.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
our
position
is
that
in
the
context
of
the
kinds
of
cases
that
we
have,
if
the
court
please,
is
they
involve
the
individual
but
the
group
status
that
the
financial
ability
of
the
individual
is
not
important
and
it's
not
important
particularly
because
of
the
fact
that
the
individual
himself,
although
he
may
benefit,
for
example,
by
a
decision
that
enables
him
to
vote
or
decision
to
permit
his
child
to
go
to
school,
sometimes
does
not.
what
does
happen
is
that
the
group
--
the
status
of
the
negroes
in
general
can
improve
and
we
think
that
this
is
the
vital
question
and
not
for
us
to
look
and
examine
as
to
whether
a
particular
individual
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
insofar
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
don't
--
we
have
never
--
i've
never
breached
the
situation,
if
the
court
please.
all
i
can
tell
the
court
is
that
we
have
not
--
if
a
person
comes
into
the
off
--
into
an
office
and
says,
“we
want
to
--
we
are
interested
in
this
kind
of
case
which
involves
the
right
of
negroes
--
my
right
being
discriminated
against
to
vote
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
do
not
inquire
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
--
i
think
that
the
state,
in
this
particular
case
has
made
a
--
it
seems
to
me
a
false
issue.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
financial
ability
is
relevant
because
i
think
that
what
is
happening
here
is
that
this
is
a
group
activity.
it
involves,
in
essence,
where
the
public
is
really
financing
and
some
of
these
people
that
have
means
are
attempting
to
furnish
the
financial
resources
where
these
rights
may
be
asserted
which
affect
the
group.
and,
under
these
circumstances,
since
these
are
public
interest
matters
and
not
matters
of
individual,
personal
and
private
concern,
i
do
not
think
that
the
state
has
a
valid
issue
in
terms
of
saying
that
some
of
these
people
here
make
$5000
a
year
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
oh,
yes,
i
think
i
haven't
got
--
we
--
i
haven't
been
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
just
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
the
--
and
i'll
have
to
--
my
time
is
been
up
some
time.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
thank
you,
thank
you.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
i
may.
first,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
one
point
and
that
is
that
this
act,
as
we
attempted
to
indicate
was
enacted
to
single
out
the
naacp
and
to
stop
it
from
engaging
in
the
--
on
behalf
of
people
in
the
activities
of
bringing
the
school
desegregations
and
so
forth.
and,
i
think
this
is
--
i
will
only
allude
to
it.
it
is
set
out
by
--
in
judge
soper's
opinion,
beginning
at
page
40
(a)
and
which
is
appended
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
40
(a)
in
the
--
at
the
end
of
the
petition.
secondly,
we
contend
that
this
--
in
other
words,
this
statute
was
passed
to
enable
the
state
to
maintain
its
program
of
segregation
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court,
if
i
may,
that
what
is
involved
in
this
is
that
what's
happening
with
the
--
with
petitioner
organization
is
that
a
negro,
as
a
group
in
virginia,
and
i
think
this
is
a
fact,
are
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
the
state
for
their
constitutional
rights.
what
has
happened
with
the
petitioner
organization
is
that
they
have
come
together
in
an
effort
to
collectively
be
more
potent
both
in
terms
of
advocacy
and
also
in
terms
of
bringing
these
matters
before
the
court
when
they
cannot
get
redress
in
any
other
manner.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
specific
thing
which
this
statute
is
striking
at
and
condemns
and
what
the
result
of
the
statute
seems
to
upholding
the
statute
what
virginia
wants
is
that
while
it
may
--
while
the
state
may
use
all
of
its
resources
that
are
available
to
maintain
the
status
quo
into
these
relations
that
negroes
will
not
have
the
benefit
or
the
support
of
an
organization
such
as
petitioner's
in
order
to
attempt
to
bring
this
matter
before
the
court
where
this
validity
of
these
kinds
of
acts
will
be
looked
at.
we
also
think
that
the
issue
control,
which
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
raised,
we
don't
think
that
this
is
really
an
issue
in
this
case
because,
in
the
kinds
of
cases
in
which
the
petitioner
supports
his
interest
is
identical
with
the
interest
of
the
plaintiff
and
there
cannot
be
in
any
way
that
we
can
see,
cannot
be
and
has
not
been
demonstrated
by
this
record
in
anyway
in
which
there
can
be
any
conflict
with
regard
to
this.
we
say
we
don't
control
the
litigation
because
the
petitioner
doesn't
control
it
because
it's
between
the
lawyer
who's
handling
it
and
the
plaintiff.
but
there
is
an
identity
of
interest
which
is
not
true
in
those
areas
in
which
the
question
of
control
has
arisen.
i
might
also
point
out
to
the
court,
in
terms
of
the
reply
brief
which
we
have
filed,
that,
in
that
case,
that
54-78
has
been,
apparently
is
being
applied
to
an
attorney
who
is
--
who
for
activities
which
he
engaged
in
on
behalf
and
in
litigation
sponsored
by
the
naacp,
the
disbarment
proceedings
has
been
brought
against
this
particular
individual
and
that
therefore,
insofar
as
one
of
the
district
bar
committees
is
concerned,
that
this
new
amendment
is
being
utilized
to
single
out
attorneys
that
have
operated
for
the
association.
and
thereby,
it
seems
to
us,
to
prevent
the
kind
of
litigation
which
had
been
traditionally
been
brought
before
the
court
to
be
adjudicated,
raising
questions
of
racial
discrimination
and
so
forth.
we
therefore
believe,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
statute
has
been
wrongly
construed
that,
as
construed,
the
statute
is
violative
of
the
rights
of
petitioners
and
its
members
to
due
process,
equal
protection,
to
--
that
it
denies
them
effective
--
a
right
to
effectively
come
together
as
a
group
and
advocate
the
elimination
of
segregation.
and
in
fact,
what
it
does
do,
we
think,
is
to
deny
access
to
the
courts
to
a
large
body
of
negroes
for
the
adjudication
of
their
rights
which
if
petitioner
does
not
bring
these
matters
to
the
courts,
they
will
not
be
adjudicated
and
litigated.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
so,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
that
i
would
make
one
call
here,
if
i
may,
and
that
is
i
do
not
regard
this
statute
as
applying
the
ordinary
rules
to
the
conduct
of
litigation.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
except
in
the
area,
if
the
court
please,
of
public
interest.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
alright.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
your
honor,
on
reargument,
if
i
may,
i
think
that
it
would
be
helpful
for
the
court
to
have
a
full
statement
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
one
statute
which
is
before
the
court
which
we
allege
and
contend
is
unconstitutional,
was
a
virginia
statute
which
was
enacted
with
the
extra
session
in
1956
and
which
statute
amended
the
virginia
bars
to
running
and
capping
to
include
the
--
an
organization
which
retained
an
attorney
or
compensated
an
attorney
in
--
or
attorneys
in
matters
in
which
he’d
have
no
pecuniary
right
or
liability
and
which
also
made
it
a
crime
for
organizations
to
solicit
business
for
attorneys.
the
statute
subjected
the
attorneys
who
were
involved
to
disbarment
and
made
the
activities
on
the
part
of
the
organization
a
misdemeanor.
on
the
theory
that
this
statute
was
a
part
of
a
package
of
anti
naacp
laws
and
was
in
fact
aimed
at
the
petitioner
and
designed
to
run
the
petitioner
out
of
business
and
in
fact
to
a
part
of
the
virginia’s
massive
resistance
plan
to
school
--
to
school
desegregation,
we
brought
proceedings
in
the
federal
court,
attacking
this
statute
and
four
others.
as
the
court
knows,
three
of
these
statutes
were
construed
by
the
federal
court
in
naacp
versus
patty.
appeal
was
brought
to
this
court
and
this
--
the
judgment
below
was
set
aside
on
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
federal
abstention.
i
might
add
that
since
that
time,
those
statutes
had
been
in
the
virginia
state
courts
and
they
have
--
a
decision
by
the
city
court
of
richmond
has
struck
those
statutes
down.
two
of
the
statutes,
one
of
which
is
presently
here
was
declared
by
the
federal
court
in
naacp
versus
patty
to
be
too
obscure
for
authoritative
construction
and
understanding.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
i
would
think
so
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
state
statute.
i
don’t
--
i
--
no
appeal
has
been
taken
because
the
matter
is
very
recent
but
i
would
anticipate
that
they
would
do
that.
unfortunately,
we’re
not
in
the
--
necessity
of
appeal.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
order
has
been
entered.
this
was
--
it
was
very
recent
that
an
opinion
handed
down.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
this
is
only
in
line
with
these
court’s
decision
that
they
question
of
lobbying
when
there
is
a
direct
contact
with
the
legislature
and
then
on
that
basis,
the
statute
was
upheld;
that
phase
of
it
was
upheld
and
was
construed
only
to
apply
to
that
kind
of
activity.
now
the
two
statutes
that
were
left
was
the
statute
which
i
have
referred
to
and
another,
the
--
we
took
the
cases
through
the
state
courts,
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction.
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
statute
which
is
now
presently
here
and
which
we
contended
is
illegal
but
struck
the
other
one
down.
so
i
think
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir,
just
one
statute
at
the
present
time.
now,
the
--
as
the
naacp
is
organized
and
i
know
that
this
is
familiar
to
some
of
you,
but
i
think
that
i
should
--
in
view
of
the
number
of
cases
that
had
been
here,
but
as
the
association
is
organized,
we
have
in
virginia
the
only
aspect
of
it
that
i
think
is
important
to
an
understanding
of
this
particular
case,
there
is
in
virginia
a
statewide
organization
which
is
called
a
state
conference.
it's
composed
of
approximately
80
or
89
branches
of
the
national
organization.
these
are
unincorporated
associations.
there
are
groups
--
with
the
--
a
group
of
lawyers
at
the
time
of
this
proceeding
and
numbered
15,
they
called
themselves
“legal
staff”
a
legal
committee
of
the
virginia
state
conference.
the
virginia
state
conference
and
the
officers
and
members
of
the
organization,
advocate
the
attack
upon
statutes
and
regulations
which
are
discriminatory.
they
urge
people
to
take
action
against
them
to
assert
their
rights.
these
group
of
lawyers
have
been
working
together
and
they
are
the
persons
that
will
panel
litigation
which
the
naacp
brings
in
the
court
or
sponsors
in
the
court
or
pays
for
which
are
brought
in
the
court
on
a
matter
of
which
there
is
a
concern
about
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination,
school
segregation
and
that
cases
--
and
cases
as
they
come.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
--
the
association
is
active
in
cases
in
the
broad
outline
where
an
issue
of
racial
discrimination
is
involved
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
state
action
or
statute
and
where
the
matter
would
be
of
concern
to
negroes
or
the
club.
it
is
also
active
in
cases,
in
criminal
cases
in
which
the
negro
defendant
is
involved
in
which
by
virtue
of
a
--
of
what
we
believe
to
be
a
denial
of
due
process,
the
administration
of
justice
has
--
there
has
been
a
failure
of
the
administration's
suggestion
of
justice
and
we
think
that
this
kind
of
case
would
be
helpful
to
negroes
in
order
to
secure
a
higher
standard
justice,
an
even
handed
justice
is
applied
to
them.
so
that
the
only
basis
in
which
the
association
takes
the
case,
it
is
that,
it's
whether
or
not
its
belief
that
the
resolution
of
the
issue
will
have
some
effects
on
negroes
as
a
client.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
issues
are
not
racial
issues
on
the
surface
whereas
for
example
in
some
of
the
confession
cases
here
and
the
case
that
you
mentioned,
the
fact
that
negroes
has
been
denied
the
right
of
counsel
or
has
been
involved
in
an
issue
of
forced
confession
or
it
has
been
a
confession
that
has
been
beaten
out
of
him
and
so
forth,
we
take
that
case
on
the
grounds
that
this
does
affect
negroes
as
a
class
and
this
will
have
some
effect
on
--
beneficial
effect
in
terms
of
the
administration
justice.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir
mr.
robert
l.
carter
now,
insofar
as
the
--
how
a
case
gets
to
or
litigation
gets
to
the
association
in
virginia,
the
record
discloses
that
the
matter
will
get
to
the
association
in
one
of
several
way.
one
that
a
person
may
come
--
we
have
office
in
richmond,
a
state
conference
office
in
richmond,
a
state
office
in
richmond
with
a
paid
full
time
executive
officer
who
is
not
a
lawyer,
persons
may
come
to
that
--
to
mr.
byrnes,
the
name
of
the
executive
secretary,
complaining
about
an
issue
of
discrimination,
complaining
that
some
action,
something
has
happened
to
them
or
some
action
has
been
taken
against
them
which
is
violated
--
violative
of
their
constitutional
right.
mr.
byrnes
will
refer
this
matter
to
a
--
one
of
the
lawyers
to
determine
whether
this
is
an
appropriate
case
for
the
association
to
concern
itself.
or
the
matter
may
come
directly
to
one
of
the
lawyers,
one
of
the
15
or
16
lawyers
on
the
--
on
the
legal
staff,
persons
may
come
to
them
as
for
example
in
norfolk
or
some
other
place
and
say
that
we
would
like
you
to
come
and
speak
to
some
parents,
we're
concerned
about
the
fact
that
our
children
are
still
attending
segregated
school
so
we
would
like
to
you
come
and
advice
us
on
this
matter.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
they
are
volunteers.
they
--
as
the
record
discloses
that
they
are
persons
who
are
only
paid
in
terms
of
per
diem
for
their
expenses
and
so
forth
when
they're
actually
involved
in
any
litigation
of
the
association
or
the
cost
of
which
the
association
pays
for.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
the
--
there
are
a
number
of
lawyers
or
few
lawyers
that
we
have
--
full
time
employ
--
full
time
--
paid
full
time
persons
who
devote
all
of
their
time
to
the
work
of
the
association
but
they're
not
in
virginia.
i
am
one
of
them.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
how
much?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
hope
this
is
--
it
is
hard
to
estimate
that
in
various
estimates
given
of
it,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
think
that
the
average
is
on
some
of
these
cases
that
it
would
cost
between
$5,000
and
$10,000
at
the
present
time
to
bring
for
example
a
school
desegregation
case
prosecuted
in
the
courts
up
to
this
level.
however,
as
you
well
know
when
the
initial
school
desegregation,
the
matter
was
brought
--
it
required
a
considerable
amount
of
--
larger
amount
sum
of
money.
and
these
things
depend
in
large
extent
upon
how
many
appeals
have
to
be
taken
and
things
of
that
kind.
but
i
think
in
the
record,
the
estimate
is
at
one
point
or
another
that
was
about
the
present
time
about
$5,000
to
$10,000.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
would
include
the
expenses
that
the
virginia
state
conference
for
example
would
pay.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
that's
in
a
court
cost
for
any
record.
there
are
things
--
there
were
some
expenditure
of
$12,000
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
which
the
--
a
little
over
$12,000
which
the
virginia
state
conference
paid
out
in
court
costs
and
counsel
pleas
in
school
segregation
cases
between
the
period
i
think
of
1956
to
1958
or
some
two-year
period
as
i
recall.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
in
virginia?
no
sir.
i'm
sorry
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
give
you
an
estimate
of
it.
i
think
that
there
have
been
--
there
is
a
great
deal
of
litigation
here,
some
of
which
is
on
the
threshold
of
being
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
the
--
as
i
was
referring
now,
the
--
the
second
ways
--
the
certain
manner
in
which
cases
are
sponsored
by
us
or
the
fees
are
paid
by
us
is
when
the
matters
come
to
a
lawyer
and
this
lawyer
will
determine
with
the
--
a
chairman
of
the
legal
staff
that
this
is
a
case
of
corporate
or
association
intervention
and
the
virginia
state
conference
will
then
decide
and
determine
that
it
will
pay
the
court
cost
and
will
--
counsel
pleas.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
pay
it
directly.
we
pay
it
to
the
lawyers
and
we
pay
the
costs
but
nothing
is
given
to
the
litigants
themselves.
in
other
words,
a
trial
or
a
parent
in
a
school
case
in
charlottesville
for
example,
who
wants
to
contest
the
constitutionality
of
his
denial
of
the
right
to
attend
school
in
charlottesville
without
being
restricted
on
the
basis
of
race,
would
the
--
if
the
case
were
appropriate
when
the
virginia
state
conference
would
pay
the
costs.
the
cost
would
be
paid
to
the
attorney
who
is
involved
in
terms
of
what
his
fee
is
and
the
payment
would
be
made
for
whatever
the
brackets
and
briefs
and
court
cost
will
be
involved
in
this.
the
--
nothing
would
be
--
no
funds
would
pass
to
the
litigant.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
this
is
--
this
is,
as
i
understand,
the
decision.
you're
talking
about
the
case
i
have
referred
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
but
you
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir,
but
you
will
recall
your
honor
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
that
phase
of
the
litigation.
we're
dealing
with
a
statute
which
has
been
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
in
which
in
my
judgment
at
least,
indicates
and
flatly
asserts
and
construes
the
activities
in
which
the
association
is
engaged
in
is
a
violation
of
the
--
of
the
statute
which
is
now
before
this
court
and
that
we
are
engaged
in
what
they
say,
running
and
capping
and
in
the
solicitation
of
business
for
attorneys
and
for
that
reason
that
we
are
guilty
of
[inaudible]
and
the
attorneys
who
are
associated
with
us
in
handling
of
this
kind
of
litigation
would
be
subject
--
subjected
to
disbarment.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
now,
i
think
that
what
has
to
be
kept
in
focus
it
seems
to
me
in
the
--
in
any
fair
appraisal
of
the
--
of
this
statute
and
this
--
at
the
present
time,
is
the
fact
of
the
negro
status
in
american
life.
i
think
that
this
in
terms
of
an
interpretation
of
whether
--
whether
these
activities
are
valid
or
invalid
or
whether
they
amount
to
[inaudible]
and
so
forth,
i
think
that
this
has
to
be
kept
in
focus
because
the
--
as
we
know,
in
terms
of
the
negro
in
america
and
particularly
in
the
south
is
that
--
is
an
individual
who
has
been
economically
and
politically
deprived
and
disadvantaged.
the
negro
has
not
been
able
to
have
any
effect
upon
the
executive
or
legislative
process,
the
state
government
for
a
long
time.
this
is
changing
because
this
certainly
has
been
true.
and
as
a
part
of
the
effort
for
a
negro
to
secure
equal
rights,
equal
citizenship
rights,
his
only
the
effective
method
up
until
the
present
time,
has
been
largely
to
an
attempt
to
bring
test
cases
or
have
test
cases
brought
which
would
determine
whether
various
acts
of
the
government
--
the
state
government
were
valid.
it
should
also
be
remembered
that
in
this
effort,
the
negro
as
a
class
is
arrayed
against
the
whole
panoply
of
state
power
and
that
the
association
in
the
effort
to
encourage
negroes
to
assert
their
rights
in
an
effort
to
find
a
way
--
ways
and
means
of
having
these
rights
adjudicated
so
that
they
can
be
[inaudible],
is
in
fact,
it
is
--
it
has
to
come
almost
--
the
naacp
and
the
negroes
in
terms
of
their
rights
are
arrayed
against
the
state
government
and
that
most
of
these
actions
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
the
action
that's
involved
in
this
record
which
is
before
the
court,
is
an
action
involving
the
reach
of
state
power
whether
or
not
the
various
acts
are
discriminatory
or
not.
this
is
not
a
--
any
litigation
that
involves
--
of
the
association
sponsors
which
involves
private
action
or
involves
individuals
as
private
persons.
what
is
involved
in
the
litigation
is
--
is
the
question
whether
state
action
or
state
regulations
as
it
affects
negroes,
conforms
the
constitutional
requirements.
and
i
think
that
it
also
has
to
be
kept
in
mind
in
asserting
the
--
whether
this
constitutes
[inaudible]
or
not
that
these
particular
statutes
which
are
now
before
this
court,
the
origin
of
the
statute,
its
antecedents
have
to
be
kept
in
mind
because
this
statute
was
a
part
of
a
package
of
statutes
which
were
in
turn
a
part
of
the
effort
of
the
state
of
virginia
to
interpose
massive
resistance
to
the
fundamental
law
as
declared
by
this
court
in
respect
to
the
school
desegregation
cases
and
of
course,
some
of
the
statutes
have
been
struck
down
and
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
sir.
i
don't
believe
that
he
has
misstated
any
particular
facts,
but
the
conclusions
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i'm
--
except
in
terms
--
i
mean
i
do
quarrel
with
the
use
of
weighted
words
such
as
solicited
and
clamoring
and
things
of
that
kind
but
the
mere
facts
of
the
--
as
stated
by
judge
henning,
i
would
have
no
--
no
quarrel.
i
think
that
the
facts
as
has
been
brought
out
are
that
the
--
the
--
the
cases
which
have
been
brought
on
the
record
which
has
come
to
the
court,
it
is
true
as
judge
henning
has
indicated
that
there
has
been
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
that
some
of
the
people
who
are
litigants
and
whom
the
association
supported
were
not
people
that
you
would
call
populous.
to
that
extent,
i
think
this
is
about
--
this
is
avowed
fact
and
that
we
have
made
no
issue
of
the
fact
that
we
do
not
as
evade
on
cases
on
--
in
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
activities
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
oh
no
sir.
i
couldn't
--
that
--
this
is
put
on
court
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
what
i
would
regard.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
in
the
first
place
--
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
believe
that
the
association,
in
fact,
channeled
anything
to
any
group
of
lawyers.
what
really
occurs
is
that
in
terms
of
this
kind
of
litigation
that
we
support
is
that
persons
come
to
the
association
and
there
are
lawyers
who
have
--
who
have
been
working,
voluntarily
working
with
the
organization
and
have
handled
these
kinds
of
things
before
have
worked
together
on
them
before,
either
people
come
to
them
or
they
come
to
us,
and
in
turn,
we
ask
the
lawyers
to
look
into
the
matter
to
tell
us
what
we
should
have.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
fact
to
that
matter,
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
in
the
record
that
would
sustain
the
fact
that
we
go
to
people
under
these
circumstances
at
all.
what
we
do,
do,
and
i
think
that
the
record
is
before
the
--
before
the
analysis
of
the
record
or
the
evidence
in
naacp
versus
patty
which
is
the
record
is
number
127
which
was
before
this
court
and
the
analysis
of
the
record
in
this
case
and
by
the
state
court
is
entirely
different.
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia,
found
that
the
calling
of
mr.
hill
for
example,
is
one
of
the
attorneys,
a
group
of
parents
calling
mr.
hill
to
come
to
speak
to
a
group
of
parents
about
an
issue
of
discrimination
or
school
problem,
was
going
to
autistic
in
and
out.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
has
really
occurred
is
that
these
people
know
and
do
know
in
most
of
these
matters
that
we
have
a
concern
for
these
things
and
our
branches
have
had
meetings
and
all
of
this
kind
in
terms
of
talking
about
the
illegality
of
segregation.
the
people
get
in
touch
with
some
person
on
the
staff
or
a
lawyer
and
say
that
we
want
to
fight
with
action.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
your
honor.
the
evidence
that
was
before
--
there
is
some
additional
evidence
before
the
court
which
the
court
in
reading
the
record
will
see
before
the
state
court
in
addition
to
the
evidence
before
the
--
before
the
federal
court.
the
evidence
in
fact
shows
that
when
the
--
the
item
that
i've
mentioned
to
you
before
and
that's
a
question
that
they
had,
a
number
of
people
testify
that
they
had
incomes
of
$5,000
or
$4,000
of
dollars.
that's
in
addition
to
the
evidence
before
the
federal
court.
the
other
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
i
--
the
--
we've
made
no
issue
of
that.
the
other
matter
which
was
before
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
--
with
the
kinds
of
issues
which
we
had
brought
up
in
the
school
cases,
showing
how
--
more
in
detail
how
mr.
hill
and
some
of
the
other
lawyers
and
the
association
got
involved
in
the
case.
but
i
think
that
any
reading
of
the
evidence
on
this
fact
that
mr.
bank's
testimony
before
the
federal
court,
mr.
hill's
testimony
for
the
--
before
the
federal
court,
reveals
that
there
is
no
difference
in
this
regard
in
respect
to
the
evidence
into
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
there
were
several
instances
testified
about
it
and
let
me
take
just
one
of
them,
the
case
involving
charlottesville.
the
evidence
in
the
--
in
the
--
before
the
state
court
show,
the
issue
was,
how
did
mr.
hill
got
involved
in
this.
mr.
hill
indicated
that
he
had,
for
many
years,
had
been
known
about
the
problem
in
charlottesville,
that
he
was
active
in
the
association
and
that
the
people
had
been
calling
him,
and
at
one
point,
when
this
particular
case
came
up
that
the
president
of
the
branch,
the
local
branch
in
charlottesville,
asked
him
to
come
to
charlottesville
to
speak
to
some
parents
who
wanted
some
legal
advice
and
who
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
that
particular
problem.
mr.
hill
went
to
that
meeting
and
the
issue
was
the
question
of
segregation
and
mr.
hill
advised
them
as
he
had
been
advising
that
the
only
way
they
could
have
secure
equal
education
opportunities
was
to
--
was
in
his
judgment
was
to
make
an
attack
on
segregation.
authorizations
at
that
time
were
signed.
some
of
which
were
addressed
--
had
his
name
on
them,
others
were
the
forms
that
were
out
and
he
filled
them
in
later
and
he
then
went
to
the
naacp
state
conference.
there
was
this
--
this
decision
was
made
and
we
should
support
the
case
and
this
is
how
we
were
involved.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
in
this
respect,
your
honor,
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia,
seems
to
say
exactly
that,
and
i
think
in
all
fairness,
i'll
have
to
admit
it
does
say
that.
although
i
may
have
this
caveat
that
what
it
does
say
is
that
all
of
our
activities
that
they
have
found
them
are
violative
of
the
statute.
it
does
say
--
it
says
where
we
would
find
that
would
curtail
our
activities
is
to
the
extent
that
the
naacp
in
handling
these
kinds
of
cases
only
has
a
limited
amount
of
funds.
it
has
attempted
to
use
these
with
as
much
--
to
make
them
go
as
far
as
they
can.
this
decision
would
seem
to
indicate
the
best
lawyers,
the
lawyers
who
are
connected
with
the
association
who
know
most
and
about
the
whole
issue
of
racial
segregation
and
the
law
who
are
most
interested
in
this
matter
would
be
the
lawyers
who
could
not
handle
cases
of
the
kind
in
this
field.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
your
honor,
the
only
thing
that
i
have
that
i
can
address
before
the
court
is
that
this
is
the
false
issue,
the
association
--
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
anyone
has
come
to
the
--
come
to
the
--
in
virginia
and
has
said
--
and
has
been
told
that
you've
got
to
use
a
particular
group
of
lawyers.
it
is
true,
of
course,
that
any
cases
that
are
handled
by
the
naacp
that
if
they're
handled
by
them
that
they
are
handled
by
particular
lawyers
who
have
been
associated
with
the
organization.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
true
but
as
i
understand
the
opinion,
mr.
jus
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
feel
that
insofar
as
our
operation
is
concerned
that
we
would
have
the
money
which
the
association
uses,
hand
--
and
cases
handled
by
lawyers
who
we
feel
are
competent
and
therefore
whom
we
would
--
we
would
be
ought
to
handle
the
matter.
we
do
not
feel
that
we
should
be
in
the
position
of
having
cases
brought
by
people
whose
competence
we
may
--
we
may
have
some
doubt.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
alright
sir,
alright.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
this
is
the
--
my
only
problem
but
if
that's
--
that's
exactly
what
the
case
would
reduce
itself
too,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
a
fact.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
but
the
point
that
we
have
in
terms
of
this
case
is
that
--
is
that
the
state,
i
think
the
state's
opinion
has
made
a
false
issue
out
of
this
because
--
and
i
suppose
--
what
i
was
trying
to
show
to
the
court,
there
has
been
--
this
is
not
a
closed
corporation
or
closed
group
of
lawyers.
the
evidence
discloses
that
the
numbers
of
lawyers
are
encouraged
to
be
involved
in
this
--
to
become
members
of
the
staff.
no
one
has
been
kept
out
of
it.
these
men
happened
to
--
or
on
the
so-called
part
of
the
operational
persons
who
have
happened
to
be
interested
in
this
particular
problem.
now,
virginia,
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
would
attempt
to
give
the
impression
i
suppose,
and
this
is
what
bothers
me
about
the
question
and
it
gives
me
difficulty,
i
guess,
would
give
me
the
impression
that
there
are
a
lot
of
lawyers
outside
that
somehow
--
that
this
is
only
channeled
to
certain
people
and
that
their
whole
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
the
--
the
--
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
alright.
the
--
the
point
is
that
the
--
the
counsel
--
counsel
in
these
cases
which
the
litigation
which
we
support
have
been
in
the
forms
which
i've
been
given
out,
there
has
been
one
or
two
instances
in
which
i
think
the
record
discloses
that
there
were
persons
who
were
not
associated
with
the
terms.
but
for
the
most
part,
i
think
the
record
discloses
that
these
cases
were
handled
by
particular
lawyers
who
happened
to
be
on
the
legal
staff
with
the
naacp,
the
15
or
16
lawyers.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir
and
i
might
add
further
on
this
record
that
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
any
individual
came
to
the
association
and
said
that
we
want
to
hire
--
we
have
a
particular
case
and
we
have
a
particular
lawyer
who
is
outside
of
your
--
not
on
your
committee
but
we
want
this
person
to
have
this
particular
case
and
that
we
have
to
turn
him
down.
the
evidence
discloses
that
whenever
the
persons
came
to
lawyers,
they
came
to
lawyers
that
were
associated
with
us.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
our
operation
would
be
crippled
for
several
reasons,
one,
i
think
that
the
knowledge
and
interest
in
the
problem
is
limited.
the
particular
lawyers,
for
example,
if
it
would
require
that
the
association
would
--
could
not
have
lawyers
who
are
interested
in
their
--
in
having
litigation
before
them
is
this
group
of
lawyers
that
manifested
an
interest,
work
together
on
the
problem,
discuss
the
whole
issues
of
segregation,
discuss
ways
and
means
and
to
pick
up
ways
of
means
to
attack
the
whole
problem
and
to
use
their
expertise
in
a
particular
manner
who
spent
part
of
their
time
learning
about
the
whole
question
of
the
reach
of
the
constitutionality
of
racial
discrimination,
how
it
can
be
attacked,
how
it
can
be
brought
sharply
to
the
issue
presented
to
this
and
other
court
squarely,
we
would,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
would
interfere
completely
with
the
--
with
the
whole
thrust
of
the
association's
operation
because
there
would
be
no
group
of
people
who
would
devote
their
time
and
effort
and
study
to
this.
there
would
be
some
lawyers
who
would
be
out
outside
who
may
or
may
not
be
interested
in
this
particular
field.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
have
had
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir,
we
have
not
and
i
think
that
it's
of
some
--
it
may
well
be
public
knowledge
that
this
court
is
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
has
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
right
in
the
newspapers
of
the
difficulty
of
secured
attorneys
to
defend
negro
defendants
in
the
south.
this
has
been
a
subject
of
some
concern.
we
think
that
not
only
must
these
cases
be
brought
but
the
cases
have
to
be
brought
on
the
basis
of
--
upon
in
which
the
particular
issues
which
involved
the
efforts
of
negroes
to
secure
equal
rights
in
whatever
category
can
be
defined
and
determined
by
the
court.
and
we
think
under
this
--
that
under
these
circumstances
that
it
is
essential
that
lawyers
who
have
worked
on
this
problem
from
time
to
time,
who
know
something
about
it
who
have
manifested
an
interest
in
it,
these
lawyers
must
no
be
jeopardized
in
terms
of
their
own
practice
by
involving
themselves
in
this
particular
operation.
and
for
this
--
for
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
we
could
--
we
could
use
the
research
but
you
don't
know
how
that
research
can
be
--
how
that
research
after
you
have
used
it
or
how
that
research
would
be
used
in
actual
litigation.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
what
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
record
shows
the
basis
for
the
courts'
statement
that
the
naacp
has
decided
as
of
about
10
or
11
years
ago
that
it
would
only
finance
litigation
in
the
field
of
segregation
which
involved
an
attack
on
segregation
itself.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
right,
right
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
right,
right.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
think,
your
honor
but
there's
anything
in
the
record
which
would
sustain
the
fact.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
no
sir,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
--
on
the
basis
that
even
--
my
problem
with
this
is
that
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
this
court,
this
--
this
--
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
says
that
this
evidence
shows
that
you
do
conform
--
and
direct
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
it
maybe
but
the
point
is
that
what
we
have
attempted
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
no
sir.
let
me
explain,
if
i
may
take
a
moment
to
attempt
to
explain
that.
the
association,
and
this
is
particularly
--
will
be
particularly
illuminated
in
the
--
on
the
issue
of
the
criminal
cases,
when
the
association
supports
an
individual
who
says
that
he
has
been
convicted
by
coerce
confession
or
the
exclusion
of
negroes
in
the
jury,
the
association
would
--
and
its
lawyers
would
underwrite
this
case
and
bring
the
case
up
if
necessary
to
this
court.
if
at
a
--
at
some
point,
and
this
has
occurred,
where
the
court
would
decide
on
some
other
basis
that
this
person
would
get
a
life
sentence
or
some
judgment
that
would
be
binding
on
him
until
his
benefit
and
he
has
no
interest
in
further
prosecuting
this
constitutional
question,
the
naacp
naturally
adheres
or
the
lawyer
handling
the
case
would
adhere
to
his
wishes.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
--
this
is
where
it's
--
and
when
you
get
to
the
question
of
school
segregation,
what
the
--
what
the
respondents
are
saying
is,
that
because
the
naacp
says
that
we
will
not
sponsor
litigation
unless
it
involves
an
attach
on
segregation
per
se
that
this
in
itself
is
controlling
on
the
grounds
that
some
negroes
who
might
be
on
the
south
would
be
happy
inside
this
[inaudible]
argued
separate
with
equal
facilities.
but
all
i'm
saying,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
we
make
that
decision
before
we
entered
the
litigation
and
after
that,
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
particular
litigant
is
going
to
pursue
the
case.
for
example,
the
litigant
may
decide
if
they
have
in
a
number
of
instances
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
the
lawyer
handles
that
and
the
litigant,
as
many
of
them
have,
have
found
that
the
--
by
being
plaintiffs
in
various
cases
that
it
made
them
uncomfortable,
their
life
is
uncomfortable
and
they
have
said,
“we
don't
want
to
go
on
any
further.”
now
in
all
instances
of
this
kind,
we
have
of
course
--
the
lawyers
have
of
course
withdrawn.
they're
not
representing
anybody
who
does
not
want
to
pursue
the
litigation.
so
that
my
difficulty
as
i
say
with
this
statement
with
the
conclusions
that
the
court
has
drawn
is
that
they're
not
based
on
my
judgment
on
any
facts,
any
evidence
that
can
be
supported
in
this
record.
and
that
i
--
i
think
that
we
do
not.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
particular
statute,
because
it
is
based
upon
the
pecuniary
right
or
liability
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
corporation
or
the
association
that
employs
the
lawyer,
pays
the
lawyer,
it
would
exact
the
liability
insurance
companies
from
the
operation
of
the
statute
and
under
this
--
under
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
they
--
the
--
the
law
would
bar
the
liability
insurance
companies
from
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
i
think
that
the
--
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
insurance
liability
companies
are
able
to
handle
cases
of
--
cases
of
this
kind
in
virginia
and
this
particular
statute
exempts
them
from
this
operation.
and
on
this
phase,
we
contend
for
example
that
the
statute
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
because
the
reach
of
the
statute
is
based
upon
the
property
right
and
property
interest
of
pecuniary
right
of
liability
of
the
particular
concern.
and
that
this
would
cover
liability
insurance
companies
and
would
allow
liability
insurance
companies
to
control
the
litigation
and
have
lawyers
handle
it
and
would
not
in
the
case
of
our
kind
in
which
the
issue
is
a
civil
rights
and
the
individual
rights
of
the
parties.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir,
we
think
--
we
point
it
out
in
our
–-
mr.
robert
l.
carter
denial
of
equal
protection,
yes
sir.
this
is
one
of
the
grounds
for
our
attack.
the
brief
currently,
if
i
may,
the
other
ground
of
our
attack
is
that
if
it's
a
denial
of
due
process
on
the
grounds
that
the
standards
which
are
applied
here
in
terms
of
the
--
of
when
a
person
maybe
able
to
assist
in
litigation
have
variance
with
general
standards
that
are
at
the
bar
and
that
throughout
the
united
states,
the
whole
issue
of
being
able
to
bring
--
test
the
litigation
is
important,
is
one
of
the
things
--
it's
one
of
the
--
because
of
the
way
in
which
this
court,
for
example,
in
the
federal
--
the
federal
court
handles
cases,
test
litigation
is
essential
because
no
matter
how
illegal
it
is,
public
officials
are
free
from
interference
by
any
of
their
activity
unless
a
case
or
controversy
is
brought
in
the
federal
court
to
handle
it
so
that
--
and
finally,
i
think
that
in
terms
of
our
objections
of
the
statute
is
that
we
contend
that
this
statute
being
a
part
of
the
massive
resistance
program
of
virginia
that
its
purpose
was
to
destroy
the
association
and
to
prevent
it
from
enabling
persons,
aiding
persons
to
contest
the
state
power
to
maintain
the
status
quo
and
that
is
if
--
if
the
statute
is
upheld
that
our
operations
will
be
impaired
and
in
this
effect,
we
think
that
this
is
akin
to
race
discrimination
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
association
--
without
the
association
being
able
to
assist
persons
in
contesting
the
validity
of
the
action
of
state
officials
in
attempting
to
maintain
segregation
in
the
state,
add
variance
with
this
cost
opinion,
then
the
whole
issue
of
the
movement
of
negroes
in
virginia
towards
security,
equal
rights
and
equal
justice
will
be
impaired.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
they
--
there
was
a
long
list
of
exemptions
in
36.
this
–-
mr.
robert
l.
carter
this
--
on
page
4
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
--
yes,
on
page
4
where
the
statute
is
set
out,
i
was
referring
to
section
58-78
which
is
about
halfway
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
in
which
the
definition
as
you
will
see
about,
again,
in
italics
in
which
--
in
which
it
has
no
pecuniary
right
for
liability.
and
my
analysis
of
that
was
to
the
effect
that
this
would
permit
liability
insurance
companies
to
control
litigation
and
would
not
permit
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
or
commercial
--
any
kind
of
commercial
interest
but
the
statute
you
were
thinking
of
was
i
believe
36
which
was
struck
down
had
a
whole
list
of
exemptions
which
people
that
were
exempted
was
found.
there's
no
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
one
before
you.
the
supreme
court
has
construed
54-78
only
to
indicate
that
it
applies
to
us.
it
hasn't
said
that
what
it
means
in
terms
of
other
people
but
it
has
said
that
it
applies
to
our
activity.
we
are
going
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
couldn't
--
i
couldn't
say
but
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
that
it
would
be
--
that
there
would
be
no
other
thing
that
they
could
hold
other
than
it
did
not
apply
to
commercial
corporations
or
associations.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
don't
know
your
honor
except
for
the
legislative
history
of
these
particular
statutes
in
which
the
one
--
the
36
that
you've
mentioned
and
32
i
believe
which
was
struck
down
which
has
a
list
of
persons
that
they
want
to
meet.
now,
the
history
of
this
statute
is
that
it
was
designed,
openly
designed
in
order
to
attempt
to
prevent
the
association
from
functioning
and
operating
and
was
concerned
only
with
the
issue
of
cases
involving
the
issue
of
racial
segregation.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
what
we
contend
the
effect
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
that
case
was
--
was
terminated
with
a
reprimand
of
mr.
tucker
but
in
the
cases
not
pending
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
is
now
terminated.
mr.
tucker
was
reprimanded.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
mr.
tucker
was
reprimanded.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
let
me
say
--
let
me
say
your
honor
that
the
issues
which
were
--
would
affect
this
case
that
is
--
that
before
the
reprimand
was
made
that
those
issues
were
thrown
out,
those
questions
were
thrown
out
of
the
case
and
the
complaint
on
that
ground
was
dismissed.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
that
was
dismissed.
mr.
tucker
was
reprimanded
on
something
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
particular
--
at
least
on
the
surface
with
the
issue
of
the
association.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think
it's
been
found,
mr.
justice
white
that
what
we
do
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
as
i
read
the
statute
your
honor,
my
only
conclusion
is
that
this
would
amount
to
the
[inaudible]
of
litigation
or
as
to
a
business
to
particular
lawyers.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
that
what
the
court
has
found,
it
has
used
language
in
terms
of
soliciting
and
channeling
and
controlling
but
it
has
said
in
effect
that
our
activities
amount
to
that.
now
what
this
leaves
us
with
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it
might
be,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
not
specifically
mention
that
and
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
seems
in
terms
of
its
opinion,
the
first
part
of
his
opinion
when
it
treats
the
statute
to
say
that
our
activities
amount
to
that
that
we
are
soliciting
and
what
we
do
confirms
this
and
this
really
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
particular
fact
that
i
gather,
that
would
be
shown
by
the
record
is
the
fact
that
we
--
that
the
association
has
admitted
that
encourages
persons
to
assert
their
constitutional
right,
that
the
association
has
from
time
to
time
indicated
publicly
that
various
laws
or
activities
maybe
unconstitutional
that
the
association
has
--
people
have
come
to
lawyers
or
come
to
the
naacp
and
that
they
have
been
given
authorizations
of
lawyers
to
handle
their
particular
case.
and
my
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
and
on
this
day
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
understand.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
your
honor,
the
point
is
that
in
terms
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
--
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
on
this
record
and
the
evidence
which
was
before
the
--
before
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
that
each
incidents
that
they
complained
of
were
instances
in
which
the
people
came
to
the
lawyers
in
terms
of
the
cases.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
what
the
evidence
will
disclose
in
this
case
and
as
the
--
and
i'm
not
attempting
to
invade
the
problem.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
didn't
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
justice
brennan
that
what
occurs
in
this
case
is
for
example
in
charlottesville,
again,
that
the
parents
or
the
president
of
naacp
branch
called
mr.
hill
who
was
the
lawyer
and
said
that
these
people
want
you
to
come
to
a
meeting
of
the
parents
to
discuss
the
school
situation
with
them.
and
at
this
meeting,
mr.
hill
had
authorizations
which
some
--
which
had
his
name
on
others
that
were
in
blank.
now,
the
only
thing
that
i'm
saying
is
that
in
this
particular
instance
and
in
the
prince
edward
county
case
which
you
will
recall
where
the
children
were
on
strike,
called
mr.
hill
and
mr.
robinson
and
said,
“would
you
come
up
to
help
us?”
these
are
the
kinds
of
instances
in
which
people
have
been
coming
to
--
come
to
the
association
seeking
lawyers
and
this
is
the
only
thing
that
i
was
attempting
to
show
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
some
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
sometimes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
was
in
charlottesville
but
in
prince
edward
county,
it
was
--
the
children
were
going
out
on
strike
was
another
example
who
asked
regarding
contact
with
mr.
hill
and
mr.
robinson
who
suggested
that
they
come
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
the
--
although
the
--
yes,
i
think
that
the
evidence
and
i
hear
that
i
--
i
think
that
the
evidence
itself
is
not
that
clear
cut
but
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
issue
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
alright
sir.
in
terms
of
the
issue
to
make
this
a
clear
cut
--
cut
question
which
i
suppose
was
clear
--
the
confusion
which
you
see,
i
think
that
this
is
the
issue
in
which
we
would
have
to
stand,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
from
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
--
that
they'd
cite
over
this.
