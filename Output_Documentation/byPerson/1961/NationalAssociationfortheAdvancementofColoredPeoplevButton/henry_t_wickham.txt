mr.
henry
t.
wickham
thank
you.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
we're
not
here
complaining
of
the
results
that
may
be
obtained
by
the
petitioner.
we
are
here
complaining
about
the
method
by
which
they
obtain
the
results.
this
question
--
this
case
involves
two
questions.
the
first
is
whether
or
not
chapter
33
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and,
second,
if
it's
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
whether
or
not
its
application
to
the
petitioner
makes
it
unconstitutional.
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
decided
three
things
it
seems
to
me,
in
its
opinion.
first,
that
chapter
33
was
not
unconstitutional,
second,
that
the
--
it
did
apply
to
the
activities
of
the
petitioner,
as
shown
by
the
evidence
in
the
record,
and
three,
that
it
did
apply
to
the
attorneys
employed
by
the
petitioner.
it
also
held
that
the
activities
shown
in
this
record,
not
only
violated
chapter
33,
but
also
the
canons
of
legal
ethics.
there
are
two
parts
of
chapter
33.
first,
there
was
the
amendment
of
section
54-74
code
of
virginia.
now,
that
section
was
first
found
in
the
code
of
virginia
of
1849,
i
believe,
and
from
time
to
time
thereafter,
it
was
amended.
it
deals
specifically
with
the
malpractice
or
unprofessional
conduct
of
licensed
attorneys.
the
1956
amendment
to
that
section
stated
that,
in
essence,
that
an
attorney
was
guilty
of
unprofessional
conduct
if
he
accepted
the
case
from
a
runner
or
capper
or
from
someone
who
had
obtained
that
case
or
gotten
that
case
in
violation
of
section
54-78
of
the
code
of
virginia
which
is
--
defines
running
and
capping.
it
appears
to
me
that
the
activities
of
the
petitioner
and
their
attorneys,
as
shown
in
the
evidence
of
this
case,
violates
section
54-74
before
the
amendment
or
after
amendment,
or
under
canons
of
legal
ethics.
it
doesn't
really
make
much
difference.
i
can't
see
where
there
would
be
any
change
in
the
decision
if
the
1956
amendment
had
not
even
been
made.
section
54-78,
whether
it
applies
to
the
laymen
in
the
unlawful
solicitation
--
for
their
unlawful
solicitation
of
business
for
attorneys,
the
statute
refers
to
persons
and
corporations
but
i
really
think
it
--
and,
of
course,
there
are
some
attorneys
who
run
for
other
attorneys,
i
suppose,
but
that
statute
really
deals
with
laymen
as
a
misdemeanor
to
violate
these
provisions.
but
once
again,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
the
activities
as
disclosed
in
the
record
before
this
court,
it
would
indicate
that
the
petitioner
would
have
violated
section
54-78
prior
to
this
1956
amendment
which
in
effect
only
stated
that
an
agent
of
running
capper
could
not
solicit
business
for
the
organization
for
--
that
an
agent
of
an
organization
cannot
solicit
business
for
that
organization
or
attorneys
employed
by
that
organization.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
as
i
read
the
cases,
that
i
in
fact
have
referred
to
in
the
respondent's
brief,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
from
54-78?
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
the
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that,
number
one,
as
i
understand
it,
they
did
not
pay
attorneys
for
the
client.
as
i
understand
those
cases,
they
haven't
--
the
brotherhood
has
no
control
over
litigation
and
furthermore,
the
brotherhood
does
not
actually
solicit
for
its
particular
lawyer
the
business
--
the
client's
business
for
litigating
in
the
court.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
the
provisions
of
section
54-78
apply
to
--
it
seems
to
me,
to
everyone
that
has
engaged
in
certain
activities.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
i
think
what
they're
driving
at,
for
example,
it's
a
virginia
case
involving
the
richmond
credit
association.
they
employ
lawyers
and
they
had
no
pecuniary
right
or
liability
in
a
particular
litigation.
their
clients
were
creditors
who
owed
money
by
various
concerned
people
and
--
but
this
credit
association
employed
attorneys
and
sent
the
clients
to
the
attorneys.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
sent
the
client
or
the
creditor
to
the
attorney
who
was
paid
by
the
credit
association.
i
think
that's
an
example
of
where
a
commercial,
i
might
say
association
as
opposed
to
a
nonprofit
corporation
as
this
petitioner,
would
equally
apply.
i
can't
follow
the
argument
at
all,
of
the
petitioner
that
these
statutes
are
a
denial
of
equal
protection
because
i
see
nothing
in
these
amendments
in
either
one
of
these
sections
of
the
code
that
classify
anybody.
there's
no
classification
in
them
really,
except
that
in
78
you
have
that
pecuniary
--
you've
got
that
pecuniary
interest
or
liabilities
there,
but
that
is
a
very,
very
broad
classification
in
which,
i
would
say,
everybody
would
fall.
i
can't
see
the
equal
protection
argument
in
this
case
at
all
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
how
the
petitioner
and
how
their
attorneys
and
employees,
how
they
operate,
i
think
they
can
–
there
is
talk
about
--
being
a
runner
of
the
business
is
--
i
don't
understand
it.
i
mean,
they
can
operate
in
the
state
of
virginia
just
like
anybody
else
can
operate
in
the
state
of
virginia.
they
could
apply
to
the
virginia
state
bar
to
become
a
legal
aid
society
whether
it'd
be
granted,
i
don't
know.
they'd
have
to
follow
the
rules
laid
down
by
virginia
state
bar
but
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes.
there's
a
statute
in
virginia
that
all
legal
aid
societies
has
to
--
the
virginia
state
bar
is
the
integrated
bar,
the
arm
of
the
state,
and
controlled
by
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
and
so,
the
integrated
bar
has
been
delegated
the
duties
of
establishing
rules
and
regulations
to
regulate
legal
aid
societies.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
petitioner
is
saying
here
that,
first
of
all,
we
are
defending
constitutional
rights
so
that
makes
us
different
from
the
next
person
and,
number
two,
we
are
a
nonprofit
corporation,
and
makes
us
different
from
another
person
and
number
three,
nobody
gets
any
gain
or
profit
from
our
activities.
so,
for
those
reasons,
we
are
exempt
from
--
come
within
the
statutes
in
question,
sections
54-74
and
54-78.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
say
that
i
have
found
no
case
that
has
drawn
that
distinction
to
date,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
don't
see
why
there
should
be
any
difference
in
your
procedure
or
your
professional
conduct.
it
should
be
right
down
--
it's
a
right
way
and
a
wrong
way
or
proper
way
and
an
improper
way.
and
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
regardless
of
the
type
of
litigation
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
procedures
and
the
proper
conduct
--
professional
conduct
of
attorneys
should
be
the
same
regardless
of
the
type
of
litigation.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
i
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
i
don't
--
i
didn't
mean
to
indicate
that.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--
and
i
hope
i
didn't
say
that,
sir.
i
just
say
that
an
attorney
should
proceed
along
long-established
methods
that
have
been
long
approved
by
the
canons
of
ethics.
now,
these
statutes
here
will
do
nothing
more
than
embody
or
codify
the
canons
of
ethics
whether
they
are
promulgated
in
our
state
or
by
the
canons
of
ethics
of
the
united
states.
these
statutes
do
nothing
more.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
there
are
few
cases
today
that
don't.
i
think
they
don't
have
some
touch
on
that
one
way
or
the
other.
but
what
we
object
to
here
is
--
or
his
--
to
state
it
in
another
way,
if
the
naacp
and
its
attorneys,
they
want
to
offer
their
services
free
of
charge,
in
my
opinion,
they
have
--
it
hasn't
violated
chapter
33
but
none
of
the
canons
of
legal
ethics,
but
what's
the
situation
here?
these
cases
are
channeled
to
the
chairman
of
a
legal
committee
which
incidentally
handles
all
the
cases.
he
brings
in
two
or
three
others
in
a
community
in
which
the
case
may
arise.
all
of
which
--
all
of
whom
are
on
the
--
this
legal
committee.
they
get
a
per
diem
of
$60
a
day.
that's
peanuts
according
to
one
statement
in
the
record.
on
the
other
hand,
another
statement
in
the
record
said
that
they
are
very
profitable.
his
associations
were
on
the
legal
committee.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
i
happen
to
read
not
long
ago
that
the
average
lawyer
in
richmond
grosses
$14,000
a
year.
that's
just
about
$60
a
day.
so,
i
don't
think
that
they
can
prove
$60
a
day
and
that
is
--
they
mentioned
somewhere
in
petitioner's
brief
a
purpose
restraint
of
trade
will
make
them
guilty
–
they
are
guilty
of
restraint
of
trade
that
they
channel
all
these
business
to
their
own
group.
getting
back
to
the
brotherhood
case,
i
think
that
they
could
--
the
petitioner
could
recommend
attorneys.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no,
sir.
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
alright.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
number
one,
they're
helping
indigent
people.
here,
we
have
no
record
of
that.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that
is
one
element.
i
think
we
have
--
i
haven't
related
all
the
facts
yet.
i
think
this
record
shows
that
--
and
i
think
we
have
to
consider
the
facts
as
a
whole,
possibly.
if
you
take
one
--
pull
one
out,
well,
maybe
that
in
of
itself
might
not
be
sufficient
but
when
you
consider
them
all,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
activities
clearly
violate
the
statute
as
well
as
the
cannon
of
ethics.
one
of
them
is
that
the
facts
that
these
people
--
the
record
shows
that
these
people
they
help
were
not
indigent
and
they
concede
that
they
don't
even
bother
themselves
with
determining
that
fact.
the
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
and
their
attorneys,
they
go
to
a
meeting
in
charlottesville
and
while
they
say
there
that
there
is
a
gathering
to
assert
their
constitutional
rights,
it
so
happens
that
they
also
pull
out
authorization
forms
at
the
same
time,
“just
sign
your
name
here,”
and
they
already
got
the
legal
committee's
name
on
the
authorization
slip
or
maybe
they
don't.
they
take
it
back
to
richmond
and
they
fill
their
own
name,
whatever
name
they
want
to
fill
in,
as
an
attorney
representing
these
people.
some
of
these
people
never
knew
who
represent
them.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
authorization
to
represent
--
for
the
attorneys
to
represent
their
client.
it
was
a
form
that
was
drawn
up
by
the
state
conference
for
the
naacp.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
sir?
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
when
was
that
drawn
up?
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
it
happens
--
if
the
--
it
happened
in
charlottesville.
it
have
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
think
it
was
back
in
1956
or
1957,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
this
law
was
passed
in
1956.
i
frankly
don't
know.
it
happened
before
that.
actually,
it
happened
--
i
mean,
another
instance
is
the
prince
edward
case
which
is
a
part
of
the
brown
decision.
it
happened
in
that
particular
case,
too,
which
started
back
in
1951.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
these
people,
down
and
off
they
go
--
they're
going
to
employ
the
attorney
for
the
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
think
that
they'll
be
violating
--
yes
sir,
because,
they
would
then
be
controlling
the
litigation
and
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--
you'd
lose
your
relationship
of
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
not
--
it
seems
to
me
that
you
almost
have
to
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
it's
a
question
of
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
it's
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
frantically,
i
think,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
as
a
practical
matter
that
is
almost
a
concluded
presumption
if
somebody
else
is
paying
that
you
lose
control.
that
seems
to
be
the
evil
that
in
most
of
the
cases
i've
read
in
various
jurisdictions
and
the
brotherhood
cases
with
one
or
two
of
them
that
the
mere
fact
of
someone
else
paying
the
attorney
that
you
lose
control
because
the
attorney
looks
to
the
person
who's
paying
him
rather
than
his
client.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
sir?
i
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
that
was
--
as
i
understand
the
illinois
case
is
--
that
was
one
thing
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that
they
said
that
the
brotherhood
could
not
do
it.
it
would
be
to
pay
the
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
pay
the
attorney.
that's
right.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
read
that
the
court's
opinion
would
indicate
that
it
was
a
conclusive
presumption
because
they
said
that
they
wanted
all
ties
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--
severed
between
the
attorney
and
the
brotherhood.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
should
say
they
certainly
implied
it
very
strongly
because
they
laid
down
the
rules
under
which
the
brotherhood
could
operate.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
right.
by,
number
one,
paying
the
attorney,
as
i
read
the
case.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct.
that's
correct
and
that's
exactly
what
we
are
here
complaining
that
what
the
petitioner
and
the
attorneys
are
doing
in
virginia
is
exactly
what
the
illinois
court
said
that
the
brotherhood
could
not
do
in
illinois.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
could
ultimately
depend
upon
a
question
of
fact
that
they
continually
suggested
there
that
it's
the
same
legal
committee,
for
example,
i
think
that
you'd
have
to
build
that
up
to
--
and
then
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
pattern
set,
but
normally
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
under
this
statute
for
them
to
suggest
competent
attorneys.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
think
you
get
into
a
close
case,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no,
sir.
if
the
petitioner
did
not
pay,
i
think
that
it's
possible
that
they
would
not
be
guilty
of
running
and
capping.
it's
a
--
i
think
it's
a
--
of
course
people
suggest,
at
least
a
john
smith,
a
layman
might
have
three
attorneys
in
richmond
he
thinks
very
highly
of
and
somebody
comes
to
him
to
ask
him
about
an
attorney
and
he
might
have
those
three
and
suggest
them
forever
and
ever,
and
i
don't
think
he
would
be
guilty
of
running
and
capping.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct,
sir.
i
would
sum
up
and
i'll
be
through,
sir.
i
think,
one,
that
they
could
continue
their
present
operation
if
they
paid
their
attorneys
nothing,
in
other
words,
if
it
was
a
true
charity
case.
number
two,
they
could
do,
as
suggested
in
illinois,
they
could
recommend
attorneys
to
these
people
who
come
to
them.
number
three,
if
john
smith
comes
to
them
and
said,
“i've
got
a
bad
law
case
here
and
i'm
an
indigent
and
i
need
some
money.”
i
think
it
maybe
they
could
give
him
the
$500,
or
whatever
it
might
take,
and
he
can
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
go
on
his
way
and
choose
his
own
attorney.
so,
there
are
three
methods,
it
seems
to
me,
by
which
the
petitioner
and
their
employees
and
their
attorneys
can
operate
under
these
statutes
and
under
the
cannons
of
professional
ethics.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
mere
fact
alone
that
they're
asserting
constitutional
rights,
to
me,
would
not
be
such
a
matter
as
to
give
them
a
different
method
of
procedure
than
the
other
members
of
the
legal
profession
have.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no,
sir.
i
don't
know.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
just
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
wouldn't
venture
a
guess.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
they
have
--
as
i
understand
the
legal
aid
societies
are
conducted
by
the
local
bar
associations--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
in
most
all
of
the
instances
then
i
would
--
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
i
respectfully
request
and
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
i
say,
your
honor,
i
see
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that.
he
talks
about
massive
resistance
and
government
standards
program.
it
was
the
government
at
that
time.
the
record
would
indicate
that
the
members
of
the
legislature
from
(inaudible)
county
introduced
this
particular
statute
and
i've
never
heard
him
being
accused
as
being
the
--
on
government
standards
massive
resistance
team.
so,
that's
one
answer
to
your
honor
and
of
course,
there
again,
another
answer
to
me
is
that
the
motives
are
not
material
here.
that
you
just
read
the
statute
and
see
that
there's
no
discrimination
on
its
face
and
therefore
we
would
have
to
go
no
further.
and
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
that's
another
problem.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
it
would
--
it
was
--
it
would
fall
or
it
would
be
invalid
under
that
set
of
facts.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
sir?
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
of
course,
the
statute
never
been
enforced
as
of
today.
there's
been
--
never
been
an
injunction
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it's
just
always
been
an
agreement
that
the
statute
would
not
be
enforced.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
so,
they've
never
been
charged
with
anything.
they're
the
ones
that
brought
this
litigation
along
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--
for
determination
and
as
matter
of
fact,
our
court
has
not
pointed
to
any
particular
section
or
clause
or
sentence
of
this
statute
that
the
petitioner
violates.
and
--
i
mean,
it
gets
me
back
to
the
point
that,
without
these
amendments,
these
sections
--
and
it
gives
you
away
from
an
evil
motive
part,
too,
without
these
amendments,
the
activities
shown
by
the
record
would
indicate
that
the
old
section
54-74
and
54-78
have
been
violated.
and
that's
all
our
court
has
stated,
as
well
as
the
violation
of
the
canons
of
ethics.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no,
sir.
i
mean,
against
us?
you
mean
against
this
fund?
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no,
sir.
they
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
he
said
somebody
asked
for
an
injunction
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
believe,
as
distinction
that
the
fund
didn't.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
didn't
know
that
was
the
distinction
in
that
case,
but
it's
immaterial.
it's
just
declaratory
judgment
that
was
brought
--
action
was
brought.
i've
forgotten
now
whether
an
injunction
was
--
i
don't
think
injunction
was
ever
argued.
i
mean,
it
was
--
it's
been
agreed
all
along
among
counsel.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no,
sir.
this
action
--
this
33
never
came
up.
the
three-judge
district
court
dismissed
this
particular
chapter
that
is
now
before
the
court.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
so
this
has
never
been
here
before
on
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct
but
my
position
is,
of
course,
that
you
can
read
the
statute
and
it's
very
clearly
applies
to
everyone.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
i'm
sure
it
has
been.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
yes,
sir.
it's
the
third
district
committee
against
--
camel
against
the
third
district
committee.
it
was
enforced
against
that
district
creditor.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
sir.
i
think
no,
it's
a
--
the
one
i
know
now.
i'm
not
sure
about
the
credit
association.
i'm
here
--
i
mean,
i
am,
too
but
the
camel
against
the
third-district
committee
was
another
case.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that
was
under
the
old
statute,
yes,
sir.
that
case
was
under
the
court
of
1942.
it
had
a
different
section
number.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that
and
nothing
more,
i
think,
would
be
personal
profit.
it's
--
the
next
step
might
violate
the
law.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
the
furnishing
of
attorney
and
the
paying
of
an
attorney.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
if
they
furnished
--
no.
well,
it
all
depends
how
you
interpret
“furnishing
the
money”
and
if
the
petitioner
will
furnish
the
client
with
the
money
and
let
him
go
off
and
pick
his
attorney,
well,
that's
perfectly
proper.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
but
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
the
same
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
or
they
can
furnish
him
the
lawyer
if
the
lawyer's
not
paid.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
it's
a
charity
case,
i
mean.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
right.
well,
of
course,
that's
when
you
get
your
legal
aid
society
comes
into
play,
but
i
might
mention
that
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
right,
though
i'm
not
sure
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
a
particular
legal
aid
society
might
not
be
approved
by
the
proper
authorities.
i
mean,
that's
--
but
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
don't
know
how
they
operate
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
don't
think
it
pays
the
lawyer
--
i
don't
think
it
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
said
suppose
it
does.
there's
some
--
these
lawyers
that
work
for
them,
i
imagine,
get
paid.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
that
was
just
--
quite
getting
ready
to
say,
your
honor,
it
seems
my
only
recollection
on
this
subject
is
that
they
come
in
as
amicus
curiae
quite
often.
i
never
had
an
experience
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i'd
like
to
add
one
thing,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice
that
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
in
connection
with
the
question
that
mr.
justice
black
asked
in
saying
the
summary
of
evidence
of
judge
soper
in
the
federal
district
--
this
record
before
this
court,
it
contains
some
300
more
pages
of
record
which
we
think
clearly
show
that
the
activities
violate
chapter
33.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
the
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
sir.
you
want
me
to
answer
that
question?
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
as
i
understand
it,
sir,
it
depends
on
what
judge
soper
meant
by
furnishing
money
to
pay
their
attorneys
if
they
furnish
money
directly
to
the
attorneys,
we
say
it
violates
chapter
33.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
if
they
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
even
though
the
client
asked
for
a
certain
attorney?
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
think
that
would
be
a
violation
of
chapter
33.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
as
i
said
last
year
in
our
open
argument,
we're
not
here
today
to
complain
about
the
success
or
failures
of
the
petitioner.
those
results
are
not
before
this
court
is
not
at
issue,
but
it
appears
that
what
is
in
issue
here
today
is
whether
or
not
this
petitioner
must
follow
rules
that
have
been
long
laid
down
by
many
courts
for
the
conduct
of
the
practice
of
the
law.
it
seems
to
be
the
local
fusion
about
the
terms
and
provisions
of
chapter
33.
chapter
33
amended
section
54-74
of
the
code
of
virginia
and
section
54-78
of
the
court
of
virginia
and
for
purposes
for
conformity
only
amended
section
54-79,
i
believe
in
the
code
of
virginia.
and
section
54-74
has
been
on
the
law
books
of
virginia
since
1849
in
some
form
or
other
and
it
deals
with
the
unprofessional
conduct
of
licensed
attorneys.
the
1956
act,
amended
and
reenacted
section
54-74,
carrying
with
it
the
same
provisions
that
were
heretofore
found
in
the
statute,
namely
that
is
unprofessional
conduct
to
solicit
business
directly
or
indirectly
in
amount
of
the
fifty-sixth
amendment
added,
i
might
say,
another
definition
of
unprofessional
conduct
though
frankly,
it's
my
view
that
it
was
included
in
the
first
and
it
was
not
actually
needed
because
it
simply
said
that
unprofessional
conduct
is
also
the
solicitation
or
the
taking
of
business
from
someone
who
the
attorney
knows
is
guilty
of
violating
or
running
in
statute,
the
running
and
capping
statute
of
virginia.
to
me,
that
didn't
add
anything
to
old
54-74.
it
didn't
take
a
thing
away
from
me.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
i
think
we
get
to
section
54-78
to
answer
that
question
sir.
that's
the
section
that
deals
with
laymen
and
running
and
capping
and
the
amendment
to
that
section
added
another
definition
of
running
and
capping
to
include
those
who
have
right
of
interest
in
litigation.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
and
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
foreign
bureau.
if
your
question
directs
to
whether
or
not
i
have
insurance
along
the
[inaudible]
with
insurance
company
furnished
me
lawyers
to
defend
my
case,
is
that
the
question?
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
know
no
consists
of
law
in
virginia
that
is
on
that
subject
that
deals
with
that
subject.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no
sir.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
the
legislature
has
insurance
company
in
mind
when
the
--
when
this
law
was
written
or
this
amendment
was
written,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
no
sir.
it's
--
the
key
to
section
54-78
is
solicitation
under
the
old
statute
and
under
the
new
amendment.
you've
got
to
have
solicitation
plus
the
fact
that
there's
no
pecuniary
interest
or
liability
involved
and
so
you
have
solicitation
in
each
part
of
section
54-78.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
and
you
can't
separate
that
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
the
right
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
if
they
suggested
that
the
--
that
i
use
their
attorneys.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
i'll
say
this
sir.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
done,
i
believe
though
i'm
not
an
insurance
lawyer,
i'm
not
sure
how
it
works
but
you
will
still
have
that
problem.
i
mean
you
could
get
the
insurance
company
if
it
was
unlawful
solicitation
and
they
could
be
or
might
be
exempt
under
the
amendment
of
section
54-78
but
why
would
they
--
they
would
not
be
exempt
under
the
first
part
of
54-78
which
is
the
real
definition
of
the
words
running
and
capping.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
right,
and
again,
you've
got
the
word
agent.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--
invoke
those
definitions.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct.
of
course
there's
a
definition
of
agent
further
down
which
was
the
original
definition
of
agent
which
i
believe
it
just
simply
says
that
an
agent
is
anybody
who
acts
in
behalf
of
a
third
party
so
it's
a
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct
sir.
in
other
words,
you've
got
two
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
think
that
that
amendment
would,
yes
sir.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
a
court
if
there
was
--
if
you
still
got
to
have
solicitation.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
don't
believe
it
is
sir.
i
think
that
lawyers
recommend
it
quite
often.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct
sir.
that
is
--
well,
now,
it
--
if
the
naacp
recommends
an
attorney
to
mr.
xyz,
they
would
not
come
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
that's
where
you
get
into
another
question
of
control.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
it
gets
in
the
word
of
control,
the
master-servant
relationship
comes
into
--
came
into
this
picture
as
well
as
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
when
you
consider
the
term
--
what
the
term
solicitation
means,
i
think
you
also
have
to
consider
the
master-servant
relationship
between
a
lawyer
and
client.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
and
paid
his
fee?
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
if
--
if
they
--
if
they
can
go
hand
and
glove,
yes
sir.
i
have
a
hard
time
in
my
own
mind.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct.
the
supreme
court
said
that
they
could
give
financial
aid
to
certain
parties
that
they
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
right
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
then
we
get
back
to
control
of
the
litigation
and
i
assume
no
control.
i
can't
frankly
see
the
distinction
whether
the
association
pays
the
client
and
who
in
turn
pays
the
lawyer
or
goes
direct
to
the
–-
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
say,
i
can't
see
the
distinction,
therefore,
i
say
that
would
be
of
no
violation,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
and
no
--
and
no
control.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct.
now,
that's
--
we
put
that
in
a
vacuum.
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
trouble
with
this
case
when
you
pick
up
this
part
here
and
this
part
here
and
say,
is
it
or
is
it
not
solicitation.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
right.
that's
the
key,
i
think,
is
the
control.
now,
they
say
there's
no
control
that
after
they
set
a
policy
for
the
type
of
case
they
will
take
but
after
that's
set,
there's
no
disturbing
the
lawyer-client
relationship.
well,
now,
when
you
consider
this
record
as
a
whole,
well,
that's
just
not
true
because
what
we
got
here,
we've
got
mr.
hill
who
is
the
chief
of
the
legal
staff.
now
he
was
the
chief
of
the
legal
staff
of
the
virginia
conference
naacp.
he
is
naacp
or
was
naacp
in
virginia.
now,
he
has
a
group
of
lawyers
that
has
started
at
13
and
they've
got
15
now
or
the
day
when
this
record
was
made
up.
and
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no
sir.
they're
not
employees.
well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
mr.
hill
was
or
was
not
an
employee
of
naacp.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
don't
think
he
was
on
a
retainer.
there
was
another
attorney
that
was
on
a
retainer
i
think
in
the
legal
--
in
the
fund.
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that
he
was.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
can't
say
if
it
was
subjecting
to
disbarment
sir
because
i've
seen
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
it
will
make
him
a
violator
of
section
54-74
which
would
subject
him
to
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
absolutely.
it
will
make
him
a
violator
of
section
54-74
prior
to
the
amendment
--
after
the
amendment,
with
no
amendment
and
with
no
law
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
kind
of
legal
ethics
and
uphold
the
law
so
held.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
not
--
not
in
mr.
hill's
case
sir.
well,
i
just
can't
imagine
the
person
of
the
local
chapter
of
naacp
in
charlottesville
and
he
comes
down
to
me
that
i
want
you
to
come
up
and
talk
to
some
parents
so
i
go
up
to
a
meeting
and
i
tell
them
what
their
legal
rights
are
and
what
their
constitutional
rights
are
and
what
they
should
do
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
so
they
all
sign
up
and
i'll
take
it
out
of
my
suit
--
brief
case
the
opposition
form.
it's
in
blank.
i'll
just
give
them
and
sign
it
and
i
go
back
and
have
my
name
and
have
other
lawyer's
name
and
then
i
go
to
court.
i
think
i
would
be
disbarred
in
five
minutes
under
those
circumstances
and
that's
my
point
here
that
it's
the
right
way
to
do
it
and
the
wrong
way
to
do
it
and
this
petitioner
can
do
it
the
right
way
and
i
see
no
reason
--
why
which
to
change
the
long
established
rules
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
how
can
i
do
it
the
right
way?
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
i
think,
one
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
think
one
traditional
you
might
say
exception,
it
really
to
me
if
it's
not
exception
but
it's
a
--
well,
i
use
to
call
it
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
what
is
or
what
is
not
proper
solicitation,
is
--
was
discussed
in
the
old
case
the
in
re
ades
by
circuit
judge
sopher
many
years
ago.
it
was
a
bottom
wall
disbarment
proceedings
before
the
federal
court
and
he
said
that
they
are
exceptional
cases
but
very
few
exceptional
cases
when
the
association
may
procure
a
lawyer
for
a
--
it
was
an
indigent
defendant
in
this
case
and
even
--
and
then
get
out,
the
lawyer
is
paying
--
got
no
fee
from
anyone.
another
instance
is
the
gammons
case
against
carolina
bar
association,
i
believe
in
which
the
bar
association
took
the
lead
in
urging
the
citizens
down
there
to
fight
these
user
laws
and
the
lawyers
of
the
bar
volunteered
their
services
to
fight
that
particular
case.
they
got
no
financial
gain
of
this.
now,
these
lawyers
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that
would
--
they
would
not
be
covered
by
this
law,
that's
right.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
i
don't
know.
these
record
shows
that
most
of
them
are
quite
able
to
pay
for
their
own
attorneys.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
i
don't
know
today
whether
or
not
in
virginia
that
there's
much
expense
involved
anymore
in
this
particular
type
of
litigation
that
--
in
this
record,
i
mean,
the
segregation
litigation.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
our
court
of
appeals?
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
consider
much
again
these
facts
as
a
whole,
as
i
pointed
out,
this
is
not
a
--
this
is
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment.
we're
really
deciding
this
case
in
a
vacuum
of
whether
or
not
mr.
hill
would
be
disbarred,
suspended
or
reprimanded.
they've
got
a
procedure
for
that
before
a
three-judge
state
court.
tomorrow,
he
might
do
something
or
i
might
do
something,
i
might
be
before
the
third
district
committee
which
the
richmond
bar
committee.
he
might
--
a
petitioner
affidavit
might
be
filed
against
him
with
the
court,
but
how
do
we
know?
we
can't
sit
here
and
really
determine
what
mr.
hill
did
in
charlottesville
back
in
1955
or
1956,
1957.
it
doesn't
mean
that
he's
doing
that
today.
i
just
can't
say
how
the
naacp
might
be
operating
in
virginia
today.
i
don't
know.
i
just
say
this
that
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
our
statutes
or
not
unconstitutional
per
se
because
really
--
that
base
really
on
our
counsel
legal
ethics.
and
number
two,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
plaintiff's
contention
here
is
that
--
really
that
it
just
don't
apply
to
their
activities.
and
i
say
to
this
court
if
you
read
this
record
as
a
whole,
it
is
clear
that
the
petitioner
has
violated
section
54-78
of
the
code
of
virginia
either
prior
to
or
after
the
amendment
or
has
violated
the
canons
of
ethics
as
the
court
below
has
held
and
that
certain
attorneys
or
certain
records,
certain
evidence
in
the
record,
indicate
that
certain
attorneys
have
violated
section
54-74
of
the
code
of
virginia
prior
to
the
amendment
or
after
the
amendment
or
with
no
statute
on
the
canons
of
ethics
and
it
seems
to
me
in
conclusion
that
for
this
court
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
of
virginia,
it
must
reverse
--
in
effect
reverse
many
state
court
decisions
not
only
in
virginia
but
in
other
states
which
had
been
cited
in
the
respondents
brief
and
also
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
solicitation
as
shown
by
this
record
is
not
proper.
if
it
does
do
that,
this
court
on
the
other
alternative,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
to
say
that
when
negroes
are
urging
their
constitutional
rights,
the
canons
of
legal
ethics
in
section
--
statutes
such
as
section
54-74,
do
not
have
to
be
followed.
we
have
an
exception
in
that
type
of
case
or
we
can
just
simply
say
that
the
petitioner
may
have
its
own
set
of
rules
and
the
rest
of
us
will
continue
under
the
old
set
of
rules.
i
urge
this
court
to
sustain
the
court
below.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
said
yes.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
but
i'm
not
–
in
all
frankness,
i'm
not
sure
of
it
that
the
--
that
the
answer
is
completely
yes.
frankly,
i
kind
of
forgotten
when
justice
harlan
asked
me
the
question
i
kind
of
forgotten
everything
that
--
i
answered
yes
or
the
question
which
i
answered
yes
to
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes
sir.
i've
got
it
right
here
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
no
sir.
i
say
this
that
i
don't
think
it's
--
i
haven't
been
in
any
of
these
cases
so
i'm
not
up
to
date.
but
we
got
a
new
chairman
of
the
legal
staff
now.
i
notice
he
is
in
all
these
cases
now
when
before
he
was
drawn
in
because
--
so
he
could
learn
and
that's
in
the
record
incidentally.
i
don't
see
how
he
can
wear
two
hats
or
can
turn
his
hat
around
and
say
that
i'm
establishing
a
master-servant
relationship
and
when
he
is
the
head
man
in
the
state
of
virginia
as
far
as
naacp
is
concerned,
that's
the
--
that's
where
i
have
difficulty
and
that's
where
i
say
that
the
control
was
there.
now,
i
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct.
he's
the
chief
counsel
in
all
these
cases.
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
it
in
another
way,
yes.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well
--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well
--
in
the
--
in
the
first
place,
the
chairman
sets
fees
in
all
cases
except
his
own
and
then
he
consults
with
the
president
and
then
they
set
his
fee.
that's
one
example
that
i
recall
is
in
the
record.
and
so
if
you're
not
--
you've
got
to
be
--
you've
got
to
keep
on
the
good
side.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you're
going
to
keep
on
the
good
side
of
the
chairman
or
you're
out.
you're
off
this
committee.
he
won't
be
reelected
next
year.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
didn't
say
that
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
having
the
staff,
to
me,
shows
a
great
deal
of
more
control
than
just
having
a
list
of
lawyers
here
when
the
staff
--
the
chairman
and
the
staff
run
the
state
conference
naacp,
that's
what
i'm
saying
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
it
can
possibly
be
alright,
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct
sir.
