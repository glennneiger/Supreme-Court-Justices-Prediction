justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mind
telling
me
--
i
understand
the
use
of
the
word
arbitrary
in
the
shorthand
method
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
stating
facts,
but
would
you
mind
telling
me
precisely
what
it
is
that
you
say
they
prohibit
you
from
doing
is
unconstitutional
and
the
formulization
of
your
statement
as
to
why
it's
unconstitutional
without
using
the
word
arbitrary
definitely
so
i
can
get
the
facts
that
you
are
saying,
you're
charged
with.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it
engages
in
precisely
what
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
petitioner
pays.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
becomes
a
crime
or
whatever
it
is,
a
malpractice
for
a
lawyer
to
handle
a
case
that
--
where
you
pay
the
fees.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
why
do
you
say
they
can't
do
that
under
the
constitution,
under
what
provision
and
under
what
formalization?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
then,
as
i
understand
it
to
say,
that
the
fact
that
you
offer
to
pay
money
and
do
pay
money
to
lawyers
who
want
to
raise
questions
of
racial
discrimination
on
their
part
to
protect
themselves
from
racial
discrimination
cannot
be
made
a
crime
as
virginia
has
not
and
cannot
be
made
illegal
as
they've
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
is
--
what
and
why
do
you
say
that?
what
provision
of
the
constitution
and
under
what
formalization
of
its
coverage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
what
provision
of
the
constitution
are
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
provisions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
they
can't
follow
this
classification
with
reference
to
that
article?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
depending
on
any
other
provisions
with
reference
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
doing
something
to
people
on
account
of
their
race
or
anything
of
that
kind?
any
other
provision
of
the
constitution
you
depend
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
their
right
to
advocate
things?
are
you
depending
on
anything
else
except
--
just
those
particular
provisions
to
which
you
refer,
equal
protection
and
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
be
forbidden
as
you
understood
–
as
i
understand
this
other
part
of
your
argument
from
paying
a
lawyer
or
helping
a
lawyer
or
advising
a
lawyer
in
the
handling
of
a
case
where
he
said
that
he
is
being
denied
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
his
race
or
color?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
with
the
case
i
mentioned
--
i'm
trying
to
get
down
to
a
concrete
thing
as
to
what
you're
claiming.
you
talked
about
civil
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
by
that,
as
one
illustration,
that
your
forbidden
to
pay
a
lawyer
because
of
your
interest
in
enforcing
the
right
of
people
not
to
be
denied
their
--
or
not
to
have
their
right
to
vote
denied
or
abridged
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
account
of
their
race
or
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
the
--
as
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
held
that
it's
illegal
in
virginia
for
an
institution
or
a
person
to
help
pay
lawyers
in
order
to
protect
that
constitutional
safe
--
constitutional
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
part
of
your
activity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asserting
the
constitutional
right
without
regard,
the
way
you
call
it,
solicitation
of
litigation,
just
what
you're
doing,
are
you
asserting
a
constitutional
right
for
an
institution
or
an
individual
to
invite
people
to
attempt
to
assert
their
constitutional
right
in
the
court
and
to
pay
those
lawyers
who
do
this
and
to
control
their
activities
in
that
litigation
to
the
end
of
protecting
their
constitutional
rights?
are
you
asserting
that
as
a
constitutional
right
to
that
extent?
it
seems
to
me
like
maybe
that's
where
you
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
you
go
far
enough
to
urge
that
although
they
can,
as
a
rule,
i
don't
know
whether
you
say
anything
about
it,
they
can
forbid
just
the
stirring
up
outside
ma
--
a
litigation
and
things
generally,
they
cannot
forbid
a
movement
on
the
part
of
groups
or
individuals
which
has
for
its
aim
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
particular
group
of
citizens
and
going
to
the
extent
of
saying
if
you
have
the
right
to
do
that
as
a
part
of
the
protection
of
those
constitutional
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
laid
down
by
the
virginia
state
bar?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
position,
i
assume
it
is,
that
a
group
has
no
more
right
to
form
this
together,
for
instance,
to
protect
certain
religious
people
from
alleged
mistreatment
or
certain
races
from
invidious
discrimination
which
deprive
them
of
their
constitutional
right
to
vote?
there's
no
difference
between
that
and
groups
which
go
out
and
solicit
business
for
--
in
general
for
a
lawsuit
between
two
people
over
a
hog
or
a
cow
or
something
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
asking
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
the
wrong
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
wrong
way
is
the
way
which
the
law
forbids
if
the
law
is
constitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
see
no
right
--
no
more
right
on
people
who
are
interested
in
carrying
out
a
general
campaign
to
protect
certain
rights
of
a
citizen
as
a
citizen
against
the
government
as
a
government
and
people
who
are
trying
to
solicit
business
just
for
the
general
run
of
the
minds
conventional
lawsuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
some
people
might
think
it
is
high
professional
conduct
if
you're
just
going
to
talk
about
ethics
and
so
forth
and
what's
right
and
what's
wrong.
some
people
might
think
that
many
do
as
indicated
by
the
history
of
groups
or
association
to
protect
civil
rights
that
it's
not
anything
degrading
in
trying
to
get
things
decided
that
are
necessary
to
protect
rights
embedded
in
the
constitution
made
for
citizenship.
but,
i
don't
think
you
can
dismiss
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it's
not
relevant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
only
can
you
just
dismiss
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
from
the
idea
that
the
man
did
--
the
man
who
would
believe
in
that,
somehow,
there's
something
wrong
with
him
professionally.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
the
key
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that
--
when
did
that
happen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
this
law
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
a
group
of
citizens
should
meet
in
richmond
and
then
offer
--
and
a
number
of
other
citizens
hold
public
meetings
and
they
say,
“we're
going
to
take
up
fund
here
and
we
want
every
citizen
who
will
--
is
willing
to
decide
they
have
--
to
bring
about
the
kind
of
litigation
necessary
to
protect
the
rights
of
people
to
vote
who
are
deprived
of
it
on
the
count
of
their
color,
we're
going
to
offer
to
hire
them
lawyers.
we
will
hire
them
lawyers
out
of
this
money,
whether
they
are
indigent
or
not”
and
a
lawyer
takes
employment.
would
he
violate
this
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
they
meet
and
say,
“we
are
much
interested.
we
think
there's
been
a
bad
suppression
of
the
rights
of
certain
people
here
with
their
right
to
vote.
the
only
way
we
see
to
correct
it
in
addition
to
public
sentiment
is
to
decide
to
institute
lawsuits
in
order
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
you
that
because
i
thought
that's
what
your
position
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
wickham,
as
to
this
paragraph
of
judge
soper's
opinion
that
this
was
the
correct
summary
of
what
you
would
say
would
be
covered
by
this
law
on
page
35
(a),
in
brief,
the
association
in
various
forms
publicizes
its
policies
against
discrimination
and
informs
the
public
that
it
will
offer
aid
for
the
prosecution
of
a
legitimate
complaint
involving
improper
discrimination.
thus,
it
is
generally
known
that
the
state
(inaudible)
will
furnish
money
for
litigation
if
the
proper
need
arises
but
the
association
does
not
take
the
initiative
and
does
not
act
until
some
individual
comes
to
it
asking
for
help.
would
that
be
covered
by
your
law?
would
that
outlaw
them
and
outlaw
the
--
and
make
it
illegal
for
an
attorney
to
accept
this
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
have
to
be
added
to
that,
under
your
interpretation
of
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
say
--
he
said
here
that
they
let
it
know
that
they
will
furnish
money
for
the
litigation
as
the
proper
need
arises.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
can
do
all
of
this
just
so
they
don't
tell
him
what
lawyer
to
get?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
understanding
of
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course
not
admitted,
(inaudible)
where
a
lawyer
serves
without
pay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
too
frequently.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
a
legal
aid
society
has
no
interest
in
just
particular
types
of
cases
such
as
this
group
and
other
groups.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
civil
liberties
union
if
it
sends
lawyers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
it
lets
people
know
that
it
will
supply
a
lawyer
in
cases
that
are
bad
enough,
pays
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
have
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
was
wondering
was
what
in
addition
to
this
constitutes
the
core
of
the
violation
if
there
is
something
that
has
to
be
added
to
what
he
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
read
to
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
wondering,
yes,
if
it's
not
too
much
trouble,
if
it
is,
don't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
not
be
possible
while
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
violated
if
they
furnished
it
directly
to
the
attorneys,
but
not
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
if
they
let
the
client
have
it
to
get
the
attorney.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
they
ask
him
to
get
a
certain
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
the
client
--
the
organization
designated
an
attorney
they
want
him
to
hire.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
violate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
40?
justice
hugo

black
you
deny
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
that
either.
justice

[inaudible]
it
is
your
position
and
i
thought
so
naacp
[inaudible]
particularly
with
regards
to
segregation.
in
order
to
do
that,
you
would
have
to
have
--
you
have
to
be
lawyers
to
try
their
lawsuits.
you
have
federal
lawyers,
particularly
in
this
field
and
through
the
degree
of
association
with
your
organization.
your
organization
finds
to
carry
on
data
for
any
concern
with
limited
amount
of
funds
it
had
[inaudible]
more
skilled
and
more
experienced
so
that
they
can
go
ahead

do

if

do
tell

if
you're
not
going

[inaudible]
justice

may
i
ask
you,
whether
you
think
the

go
so
far
as
the

include

it
goes

it

direct
to

the

the

can
change

you

get
