justice
potter

what
do
you
suppose
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
means
on
top
of
page
11
when
it
says,
“all
costs
and
expenses
incurred
in
such
suits
brought
on
behalf
of
negroes
are
borne
by
the
fund”?
is
that
just
a
mistaken
--
a
mistake
in
fact
or
have
i
misread
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
misunderstood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
this
litigation
arose
as
a,
what,
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
or
an
injunction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
it
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
this
also
then
became
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
in
virginia.
justice
potter
stewart
and
injunction
in
virginia.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
plaintiff
--
the
only
plaintiff
was
the
naacp.
the
fund
was
not
a
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
just
let
me
pursue
this
a
moment,
excuse
me,
and
a
declaratory
--
both
the
fund
and
the
naacp
lost,
in
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
fund
does
not
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
or
not
brought
certiorari
here.
does
this
mean
that
you
concede
that
the
fund
is
subject
to
this
statute
and
as
applied
to
it
that
the
statute
is
constitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
court
did
say
that
the
statute
applies
to
the
fund.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
as
so
applied,
the
statute
is
constitutional
and
the
fund
did
not
ask
for
any
review
here
of
that
--
of
this
point.
justice
potter
stewart
and
upon
unconstitutionality,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
not
just
the
mere
paying
wouldn't
do
it,
would
it?
isn't
that
under
the
other
statute
that
was
struck
down
by
the
virginia
supreme
court?
simply
paying
for
somebody
else's
litigation
i
thought
was
covered
by
the
chapter
that
was
struck
down
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
struck
down.
so,
the
simple
matter
of
paying
would
not
violate
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
doesn't
this
statute
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
i
may
be
entirely
mistaken,
but
doesn't
this
statute
make
illegal
only
a
combination
of
two
things,
the
solicitation
of
litigation
plus
the
paying
of
lawyers
to
handle
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
the
aclu
operate?
have
you
--
do
you
know
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
--
the
american
civil
liberties
union?
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
talked
about
a
different
method
of
procedure
from
what
other
people
have
and
i
wondered
how
similar
their
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
operations
were
to
these.
justice
potter
stewart
does
this
sub
--
justice
potter
stewart
has
this
statute
ever
been
enforced
against
anybody?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
in
its
form
before
the
1956
amendments?
was
it
ever
been
enforced
against
anybody?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
believe
you
cite
any
cases
from
--
between
you
and
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
entered?
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
were
under
the
old
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
it
often
get
into
cases
after
they've
started
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
have
just
one
here.
justice
potter
stewart
the
naacp
also
has
been
active
in
litigation
of
somewhat
different
kind
--
they're
--
in
the
record
i
saw
references
to
naacp
lawyers
who
would
--
have
been
acting
in
criminal
cases
involving
perhaps
a
white
victim
or
colored
defendant
or
vice
versa.
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
i
remember
shortly
before
i
left
the
court
of
appeals,
there
was
a
case
from
michigan
and
the
facts
were
that
the
defendant
petitioner
was
a
negro
and
the
victim
had
been
a
white
person
but
the
issues
in
the
case
were
whether
or
not
he
had
been
wrongfully
deprived
of
the
counsel
because
he
has
pleaded
guilty
and
denied
trial
in
michigan,
they
will
take
--
still
take
cases
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
issues
that
they
were
not
racial
issues
on
the
surface.
justice
potter
stewart
are
these
15
or
16
lawyers
are
--
are
they
full
time
employees?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
lawyers
in
virginia
who
are
full
time
employees?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
carter,
before
you
go
further,
i
wonder
if
i
could
take
you
back.
you
began
by
describing
factually
the
activities
of
the
naacp.
are
there
any
factual
inaccuracies
in
the
opinion
of
judge
henning
for
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course,
you
disagree
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
you
wouldn't
be
here
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
his
--
the
facts
are
stated
in
those
opinions
and
in
that
opinion,
you
do
not
quarrel
with
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
kind
of
a
summary
paragraph
on
page
15-a
of
the
petition
--
your
petition
for
certiorari
and
i
can
see
that
there
are
some
color
words
but
there
are
words
in
there
that
you
--
i
don't
think
they
please
you
but
forgetting
those
--
is
that
--
it's
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph
on
page
15-a.
justice
potter
stewart
in
short,
the
activities
of
the
naacp
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
but
now,
what
are
the
inaccurate
facts
or
something
except
for
the
use
of
the
majority
word?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
bottom
of
the
paragraph
--
the
paragraph
that
begins
on
the
bottom
of
15-a
and
runs
over
into
16-a,
the
virginia
court
points
out
that
the
difference
in
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
additional
evidence
of
this
case,
additional
to
that
that
was
before
the
federal
court
in
naacp
against
patty,
is
that
inaccurate
or
incorrect?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hill
himself
a
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
is
mr.
hill
a
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
was
the
one
who
address
this
meeting?
justice
potter
stewart
they
do
refer
litigation
to
the
lawyers
and
they
do
pay
them.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
would
be
accepted
from
this
law
because
they
would
have
a
pecuniary
interest,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
chapter
33,
does
not
apply
--
its
provisions
do
not
apply
if
the
corporation
has
a
pecuniary
interest
in
the
litigation
and
i
should
assume
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
an
insurance
company
which
might
be
liable
to
fail
if
the
--
if
its
insured
loses
would
have
a
pecuniary
interest.
justice
potter
stewart
the
solicitation
of
whom,
by
whom
of
what?
the
solicitation
of
the
lawyer
by
a
corporation,
isn't
that
it,
the
procurement
of
a
lawyer
by
a
corporation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
an
insurance
company
in
mr.
justice
black's
case
would
be
soliciting,
wouldn't
it
in
that
sense
of
the
word.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
insured
--
you're
uninsured
and
you
heard
--
you
become
a
defendant
and
your
liability
insurer
says,
“we'll
furnish
your
lawyer
and
we'll
pay
him.
now,
wouldn't
they
come
under
the
statute
except
for
the
exception
relating
to
know
virginia
in
which
it
has
no
pecuniary
right
of
liability?
they
would
not
come
under
only
because
of
that
exception,
wouldn't
that
be
true?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wouldn't
be
an
agent
of
the
attorney,
would
they?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
quite
similar
whether
they'd
come
under
the
old
--
whether
--
either
with
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
either
the
naacp
or
an
insurance
company
would
come
under
the
original
version
of
the
statute
as
to
the
amount
who
is
agent,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
involves
the
--
you
said
that
the
element
of
control
were
lacking.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
statute
would
not
be
violated
and
justice
harlan
then
said,
that's
the
implication
of
what
the
virginia
court
said,
isn't
it?
and
you
said
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
would
suppose
you're
relying
on
the
last
sentence
on
page
14-a
and
the
top
sentence
on
page
15-a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
you
better
look
at
it
before
you
