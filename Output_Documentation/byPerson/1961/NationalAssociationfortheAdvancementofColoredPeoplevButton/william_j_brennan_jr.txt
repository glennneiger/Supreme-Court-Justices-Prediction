just
out
of
curiosity,
mr.
carter,
what's
happened
to
those
three?
are
they
back
before
the
virginia
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
carter,
what's
capping?
what's
capping?
i

heard
that
expression.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
my
state,
we
call
the
man
who
is
chasing,
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
by
that,
mr.
carter,
in
the
district
court,
is
the
fund
now
asking
if
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
virginia
courts,
be
struck
down
as
unconstitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
whereas
you're
here
or
the
naacp
is
here
asking
us
to
strike
the
statute
down
contrary
to
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
virginia
courts
that
it
was
constitutional,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i
--
do
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
you
didn't
feel
that
the
fund
could
come
here
because
all
it
sought
was
a
declaration
of
its
application
to
the
fund,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right,
and
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
want
to
ask
you
that
question.

(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
it
will
be
at
all
significant,
mr.
carter,
but
wouldn't
you
tell
us
that
the
fund
employs
a
salaried
lawyer,
$6000
a
year
or
something,
and
that's
not
so
regarding
the
employee
--
the
lawyers
who
comprise
the
committee
for
the
naacp.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fund
had?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
suppose,
mr.
wickham,
they
continued
to
suggest
the
same
legal
committee
that
did
not
pay
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
they
did
not
pay
them,
even
if
the
petitioner
did
not
pay?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see
if
i
get
that.
does
that
mean
then
everything
that
you
say
that
this
record
shows,
the
petitioner
has
done
or
might
be
done
by
the
petitioner
without
violating
the
statute
if
the
petitioner
stopped
paying
any
compensation
to
the
attorney?
