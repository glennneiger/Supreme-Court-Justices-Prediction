justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter,
on
the
basis
of
your
reply
to
justice
harlan,
i'd
like
to
put
you
this
case
and
let
me
say
by
way
of
preface
that
i'm
never
troubled
by
questions
of
degree
of
a
necessity
of
growing
lines.
so
that
the
case
i
put
to
you
isn't
exactly
this
case,
but
your
answer
will
shed
some
light
at
least
to
me
on
your
contention.
suppose
instead
of
this
kind
of
an
investigation,
we
had
a
totally
different
case
that
these
14
men,
who
were,
according
to
the
record
in
this
case,
authenticated
or
identified
communists,
suppose
you
didn't
have
that
situation,
but
these
14
men
were
named
in
some
publication
as
communists
or
charged
with
being
communists
and
they
there
--
because
of
that
--
on
that
--
on
the
basis
of
that
publication
brought
a
libel
suit.
i
don't
know
if
the
law
applies
this
but
certainly
the
law
of
good
many
states
charged
a
man
of
being
a
communist
is
libelous
if
the
plaintiff
can
disapprove
that
because
the
plaintiff
says
he
isn't
and
no
proof
can
be
made
that
he
is.
let
us
assume
that
in
florida
to
charge
a
man
with
being
a
communist
is
a
libelous
accusation
and
these
14
men
bring
a
libel
suit
against
the
publication
so
charging
one.
the
defense
is
that
in
order
or
it
appears
in
the
course
of
the
--
of
the
trial
that
the
defense
claimed
that
in
order
to
conceal
to
--
to
cover
up
and
camouflage
their
communist
affiliation
they
sought
and
became
members.
they
were
due
paying
members
of
the
local
branch
of
the
naacp
as
a
cover
for
their
activities
as
communist
on
the
basis
that
all
right-minded
people
know
that
the
naacp
is
not
a
communist
or
a
communist
connected
or
affiliated
or
sympathetic
organization.
and
the
plaintiff
then
puts
on
the
stand
the
custodian
of
this
--
of
--
of
the
naacp
as
here
and
asked
him
on
direct
examination
whether
naming
them
or
any
of
them
was
in
fact
a
member
of
the
naacp,
was
a
registered
member
on
the
books
of
the
naacp
and
he
forthrightly
says
quite
clearly,
“no,
of
my
own
knowledge,
i'm
able
to
swear
that
they're
not.
they
do
not
belong
to
the
naacp
branch.”
on
cross-examination,
the
defendant
saying
all
human
memory
is
treacherous
and
asked
him
to
produce
the
membership
list
and
examine
the
list
in
order
to
verify
the
correctness
of
his
memory.
and
he
declines
and
a
subpoena
issues,
and
the
subpoena
is
--
is
disobeyed
and
then
the
question
arises
whether
the
court
has
compulsory
power
to
compel
the
custodian
to
produce
that
list
not
with
the
view
of
disclosing
it,
the
list
as
such,
not
with
the
view
of
putting
the
list
in
the
possession
of
counsel
for
the
plaintiff,
not
with
the
view
of
even
having
the
court
examine
the
list
but
counsel
for
defendant
on
cross-examination
being
a
rigorous
cross-examine
says
i
--
just
to
ask
you
to
turn
the
pages
of
your
membership
list
and
now
tell
me
after
you've
done
whether
you
adhere
to
your
testimony
or
all
your
testimony
unaided
by
any
reference
to
the
record
that
these
14
people
are
not
members
of
your
organization.
would
that
disobedience
--
disobedience
with
that
subpoena
also
claim
the
immunity
from
production
on
the
basis
of
the
alabama
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
quite
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
how
could
it
--
how
could
it
be
seized
except
by
a
third
order
of
--
of
a
subpoenaing
authority
whether
a
court
or
a
committee
which
then
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
it
--
i
may
misunderstand
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
list
here
would
not
become
evidentiary,
it
would
not
be
an
exhibit
for
instance,
it
wouldn't
be
an
exhibit
marked
for
identification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
merely
--
so
far
as
possible,
i
thought
i
stated
except
the
issue
would
be
different,
it
would
be
before
a
court
instead
of
an
investigating
body,
but
i
thought
i
gave
as
close
a
duplicate
original
of
the
legal
situation
at
least
as
my
limited
imagination
could
divine.
and
i
wanted
to
ask
you
whether
your
real
position
was
that
at
least
--
as
far
as
to
say
it
because
i
don't
want
to
carry
an
implication
that
i
don't
mean,
that
at
least
in
this
--
in
--
in
the
state
like
florida
or
in
kindred,
southern
state,
the
list
itself
is
immunized
from
any
kind
of
legal
production,
for
any
purpose
whether
the
list
becomes
an
exhibit
or
identification
or
in
evidence,
the
list
is
producible
for
general
purposes
or
limited
purposes.
and
i
just
wondered
whether
you
thought
the
--
the
reach
of
the
alabama
case
or
the
momentum
which
one
decision
gives
to
a
succeeding
set
of
facts
linking
it
together
which
is
what
you
fear,
whether
--
or
thereby
your
conclusion
is
or
your
submission
is
that
the
list
in
the
circumstances
we're
dealing
with
is
as
such
immunized
for
all
evidentiary
or
producible
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting,
mr.
carter,
remotely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
an
answer.
it's
a
troublesome
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
the
state
interest
of
being
sure
you
get
the
truth
so
far
as
humans
are
capable
of
producing
it
and
the
same
kind
of
state
interest
that
i've
put
in
my
case,
i
don't
mean
to
give
an
answer
to
it,
mr.
carter,
namely
that
--
that
memory
--
people
are
awfully
sure.
i
speak
from
deep
personal
experience.
people
are
awfully
sure
sometimes
that
they
can
turn
out
to
be
quite
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
an
issue
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying,
if
i
get
your
argument
mr.
carter,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
law
knows
a
number
of
not
too
many
appellees
because
the
first
record
is
of
a
society
is
to
be
able
to
elicit
the
truth
in
a
matter
in
controversy.
but
that
there
are
countervailing
considerations
of
policy
whereby
the
truth
is
fenced
off
from
being
disclosed
in
court
before
investigating
body
because
as
those
to
circumstances,
i
mean
the
various
privileged
communications,
husband
and
wife,
lawyer
and
client,
priest
and
confessor
and
the
communicator,
etcetera,
that
in
those
instances,
the
normal
regular
very
vital
interest
of
society
to
elicit
the
truth,
at
least
to
elicit
evidence
with
the
view
to
obtaining
or
ferreting
out
the
truth
must
be
used
in
other
interest
of
society
to
shut
off
that
source
of
information.
what
you
are
saying
is,
in
situations
presented
by
your
case
falls
within
that
rule
of
privilege,
that's
what
you're
saying
in
the
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
your
--
that
the
basis
of
your
argument,
at
least
a
vital
consideration
of
it
is
reasonable
fear
of
consequences
then
i
should
think
geography
might
make
a
difference
if
reasonable
fears
don't
exist.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
think
if
you
had
an
unpopular
corporation
if
there
be
such,
if
you
had
an
unpopular
or
a
corporation
for
the
time
being
under
some
public
what
shall
i
say,
anxiety
or
disfavor
and
a
law
arose
which
makes
otherwise
relevant
the
ascertainment
where
there
are
certain
persons
or
stockholders
in
that
corporation
pursues
a
heavy
stockholder
that
--
that
we
would
have
the
same
case
of
associated
protection
of
those
who
are
members
of
--
of
an
enterprise
whether
it
be
the
naacp
or
the
xyz
corporation.
do
you
think
all
these
things
are
all
the
same
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter,
can
we
end
on
a
harmonious
note
and
agree
that
the
first
amendment
applies
throughout
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter
before
you
–
i
beg
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
and
i
might
--
perhaps
should
have
asked
mr.
hawes
since
you're
the
petitioner
here,
i'll
ask
you.
he
spoke
of
reverend
--
mr.
gibson
answering
a
question,
there
are
no
questions
in
controversy
in
this
lawsuit
except
the
question
--
will
you
look
at
the
record?
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
no
--
no
oral
--
no
oral
inquiries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
right,
isn't
it?
