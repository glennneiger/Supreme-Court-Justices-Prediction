o.

you
will
discuss
cases
like
the
uphaus
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
in
your
own
time.
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
--
would
you
mind
restating
that
question
in
a
few
words
because
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you're
saying,
follow
the
prior
decisions
of
the
court.
justice
william
o.
douglas
some
what
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
you
look
at
this
request
of
this
--
the
florida
committee
a
little
more
closely
you
see
that
some
of
the
matters
they
want
to
discover
who
has
been
at
any
time
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
past
members
as
well
as
present
members,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but,
would
the
committee
--
do
you
think
a
committee
in
a
state
or
congressional
committee
have
authority
to
make
a
canvass
of
its
jurisdiction
to
see
how
many
people
that
ever
joined
the
communist
party
without
being
relevant
to
any
legislative
purpose?
justice
william
o.
douglas
leaving
out
all
--
present
membership.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
talking
about
past
membership,
30-year-old
membership,
20-year-old
membership,
10-year-old
membership.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
this
is
a
pretty
broad
nexus
thrown
here,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
53,
55
past
or
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know,
but
i
say
55
members
were
said
to
be
past
or
present.
i
just
wondered
what
the
past
membership,
what
relevancy,
possible
relevancy
that
has?
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
i
imagine,
if
you
look
--
start
looking
in
the
past
of
it,
any
person
you'd
apt
to
find
something
that
might
be
held
to
ridicule
him
if
it
was
exposed
or
degrade
him
or
her
if
it
were
exposed?
i
don't
suppose
anybody
is
without
some
sin
or
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
just
wondered
how
--
what
legislative
can
use
such
a
big
myth
to
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
in
this
field.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
what
i'm
talking
about,
this
field
is
past
membership.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course,
you
might
say
that
the
--
he
might
still
be
operating
underground
that
might
be
just
a
front.
it
illustrates
the
great
danger
of
getting
into
this
field
at
all
unless
you
are
investigating
not
the
ideas
and
ideology
and
political
faith,
but
actions.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
understand
what
i
mean?
justice
william
o.
douglas
a
10-year
old
membership
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
and
then
perhaps
he
went
underground.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
didn't
suggest
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
my
question
would
be
as
relevant
but
if
this
was
a
white
council
and
you're
investigating
past
membership,
(voice

--
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course
the
legislative
objective
is
not
restricted
to
overthrow
the
government.
it
could
be
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
anything
which
you
might
--
that
might
be
legislation
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
so,
i
would
think
that
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
any
evidence
that
the
organization
that
you're
investigating
was
engaged
in
--
engaging
in
communist
activities.
