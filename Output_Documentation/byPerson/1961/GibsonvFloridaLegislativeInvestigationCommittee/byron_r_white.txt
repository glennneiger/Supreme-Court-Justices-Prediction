justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean,
do
you
mean
there
was
inadequate
proof
that
any
of
--
for
example
the
14
names,
really
were
communists
or
were
active
communists?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
the
absence
of
both
of
those
is,
what
you
mean
by
the
lack
of
predicate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
what
it
amounts
to,
not
having
a
predicate?
justice
byron
r.
white
something
else
amounts
to
that?
those
of
the
two
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
make
my
question
clear.
let's
assume
there
really
was
adequate
proof
that
there
were
14
known
admitted
communists
who
were
members
of
the
naacp,
now
does
this
make
a
--
does
this
make
--
assume
they
had
independent
proof
of
it,
assume
they
all
come
in
and
said
they
were
members
of
the
naacp.
and
they
wanted
their
application
from
your
organization,
from
your
secretary,
is
that
predicate
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
show
that
there
is
a
--
that
the
organization
is
dominated
or
infiltrated?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
may
be
a
member
of
the
board
or
inactive
officers?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
the
[inaudible],
they're
saying
that
his
has
--
this
verified
that,
out
of
the
14
names
off
the
membership
list,
and
the
--
how
did
the
--
how
did
an
organization
engage
in
this
activity
that
you
say
that
some
of
the
organization
would
have
to
be
engaged
in
such
sort
of
acts
--
of
violent
activity
of
this
--
promoting
this?
well,
what
if
some
of
its
members
were,
would
the
organization
be
doing
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
it's
also
engaged
in
some
illegitimate
activity
through
some
of
its
members?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
legislative
committee
for
example
shouldn't
--
they
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
find
out
that
whether
or
not
the
organization
was
engaged
in
this
sort
of
activity
by
inquiry
from
the
organization.
they
must
get
evidence
independently
first
before
they
can
find
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
think
they
--
do
you
think
that
it
could
be
--
did
they
ask
the
secretary,
do
you
have
any
communists
in
your
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
--
you
couldn't
say,
well
here,
these
communists
are
these
two
members
of
your
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
please
check
from
your
membership
list.
justice
byron
r.
white
towards
the
--
when
this
question
was
asked,
it
was
already
of
the
record,
a
public
record,
all
the
evidence
to
whether
or
not
the
14
were
communists
or
whether
or
not
they
were
members
of
the
naacp,
all
the
other
evidence
was
already
in
the
record.
and
that
--
perhaps
we
can
answer
them
tomorrow
why
it
was
that
(inaudible)
--
why
it
wasn't
to
the
interest
of
the
naacp
to
verify
or
not
the
membership
of
these
people
who
had
--
on
the
public
record
were
said
to
be
members
are
active
even
in
organization.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it's
necessary
to
have
that
[inaudible]
how
does
this
require
to
become
effective
if
the
witness
shouldn't
be
aware
of
your
information.
how
can
he
ever
exercise
his
right
to
disclose
or
not
to
disclose?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
did
that
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
man
--
can
you
tell
me
offhand,
which
one
of
the
14
you
had
the
most
information
about
concerning
his
connection
with
the
naacp?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
does
this
connects
with
the
communist
party
also
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
any
strong
evidence
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
reverend
gibson
know
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
anybody
say
about
it
--
did
you
have
any
evidence
that
any
of
the
14
was
a
member
of
the
naacp
or
just
attended
meetings?
justice
byron
r.
white
abe
sorkin
has
the
clearest
case,
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
the
one
who
refused
to
say
one
way
or
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hawes,
do
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
you
were
entitled
to
have
verified
the
membership
[inaudible]
all
the
50
or
just
the
14
[inaudible]?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
feel
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
produce
some
evidence
that
some
communists
are
perhaps
members
or
attended
meetings
with
the
naacp
like
the
14
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
then
--
you
may
present
a
list
of
any
numbers
of
other
communists,
whether
you
have
any
knowledge
of
their
connection
with
naacp
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
those
other
than
30
in
that
connection?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
you
wouldn't
have
had
anything
to
tell
us
about
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
connection
with
the
naacp?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
want
to
know
[inaudible]
that
if
you
hadn't
told
him
that
you
had
that
you
--
that
you
knew
nothing
about
their
connection
with
the
naacp
would
give
them
right
to
verify
their
membership
or
not
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
(inaudible)
--
you
placed
the
--
you
placed
14
communists
in
the
naacp
do
you
feel
that
established
sufficient
nexus
between
the
communist
party
and
the
naacp
to
ask
about
the
--
sort
of
a
--
a
lot
of
other
[inaudible]
--
justice
byron

white
was
he
convicted
for
--
he
was
convicted
for
contempt,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
answering
parti
--
not
review

to
answer
particular
questions
or
were
there
many
counts
