mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
court
please,
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
to
review
the
constitutional
validity
of
that
judgment
which
affirmed
the
conviction
of
petitioner
for
contempt
and
sends
him
to
six
months
imprisonment
and
fine
for
refusing
to
obey
a
court
order
which
required
him
to
bring
to
the
hearings
of
the
respondent
committee
the
membership
list
of
his
organization
for
the
purpose
of
validating
the
inquiries,
his
answers
to
inquiries
concerning
the
associational
relationship
of
persons
alleged
to
be
subversive
with
the
naacp
to
which
he
belonged.
as
we
see
the
issue,
if
the
court
please,
the
basic
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
place
it
within
the
orbit
of
naacp
versus
alabama
and
bates
versus
little
rock
and
pertinent
cases
of
whether
there
is
an
overriding
state
interest
which
is
sufficient
to
enable
the
state
to
pierce
the
constitutional
protection
and
therefore
that
the
doctrines
of
barenblatt,
uphaus,
wilkinson
and
braden
and
florida.
we
contend,
of
course,
that
the
--
this
issue
--
this
situation
is
unlike
the
latter
cases
and
that
on
the
facts,
although
the
facts
are
somewhat
different
but
that
the
law
--
the
same
application
of
the
law
which
this
court
applied
in
naacp
versus
alabama
is
applicable
here.
the
facts
are
somewhat
of
this
nature.
on
november
4th
and
5th
of
1959,
the
respondent
committee
held
hearings
in
tallahassee,
alabama
and
tallahassee,
florida
an
issue
to
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
petitioner
and
others
requiring
them
to
bring
all
records
in
respect
to
the
membership
list
of
persons
in
the
naacp
in
mi
--
in
miami.
the
petitioner
and
other
persons
appeared
and
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing,
the
chairman
read
the
statute
which
gave
the
committee
authority
and
that
statute
is
set
out
on
pages
two
and
three
of
our
brief,
brief
for
petitioner,
and
then
he
made
a
statement
that
the
hearing
was
concerned
with
the
activities
of
various
organizations
operating
in
florida
in
the
field
of
race
relations,
coercive
reform
of
social
and
educational
practices
in
more
ways
by
litigation
and
pressured
administrative
action.
the
labor
education
of
the
vital
places
of
life
upon
this
party,
communist
front
organizations
variance
in
the
degree
depending
to
which
communists
and
communist
front
organizations
have
succeeded
in
penetrating,
infiltrating
and
influencing
various
organ
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
the
statement
begins
in
the
record
at
pages
--
at
page
8
of
record.
we
have
--
and
the
statement
that
i
am
referring
to
in
--
on
page
12,
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
12.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
thereupon
the
--
the
chairman
called
a
--
one
arlington
sands
and
we
contend
was
the
chief
witness
for
the
committee
who
had
any
--
allegedly
had
any
personal
knowledge
of
the
facts
that
they
attempted
to
adduce.
on
the
day,
november
4th,
mr.
sands
was
not
present
and
the
next
witness
was
a
--
the
investigator
of
the
committee.
the
investigator
of
the
committee
proceeded
to
testify
that
there
were
some
14
persons
who
he
met,
set
out
in
detail
whom
on
his
investigation
were
members
of
the
communist
party
or
were
active
in
subversive
organizations
and
were
according
to
the
information
of
the
committee,
members
or
had
been
active
in
the
miami
branch
of
the
naacp
he
also
named
some
33
other
persons
who
he
indicated
had
been
in
florida
at
the
present
time
or
were
--
or
is
engaged
in
this
subversive
activities
and
on
the
basis
of
the
committee
statement
investigation
were
active
in
the
organization.
petitioner
was
then
called
and
he
stated
that
he
was
the
custodian
of
the
membership
list
that
he
had
--
the
membership
list
of
the
branch
was
in
his
custody.
that
membership
in
the
organization
was
on
a
year-to-year
basis
that
he
had
been
present
in
the
organization
for
five
years.
he
pointed
out
that
the
organization
had
adopted
a
--
an
affirmative
anti-communist
policy
in
its
1950
convention
and
had
repeated
it
thereafter
which
barred
communists
from
the
organization.
and
he
indicated
in
answer
to
questions
from
the
committee
counsel
that
he
would
be
willing
to
testify
of
his
own
knowledge
as
to
whether
various
persons
who
were
named
and
alleged
to
be
by
the
committee
subversives,
as
to
whether
those
people
were
in
fact
members
of
the
organization
but
he
would
not
and
he
had
not
brought
the
membership
list
and
he
would
not
--
and
refused
to
validate
his
testimony
against
the
membership
list
itself.
after
--
in
the
course
of
the
testimony,
he
was
shown
pictures
of
some
of
these
14
persons
i
have
mentioned
and
each
instance
he
--
his
statement
was
that
some
of
the
people
he
recognized
and
some
he
did
not
but
that
he
would
--
that
he
had
no
knowledge
if
they
had
been
members
of
the
organization.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
he
push
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
petitioner
gave
a
figure
of
1000.
he
said
that
he
was
not
sure
of
that
but
that
he
was
reasonably
sure
that
this
was
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
i'm
not
sure
that's
it.
these
were
14
people
that
the
committee
had
said
that
it
had
reason
to
believe
were
members
of
the
communist
party
and
were
--
they
had
reason
to
believe
or
felt
were
also
members
of
the
organization.
in
addition
there
were
some
33
members.
there's
never
any
statement
by
the
committee
that
these
people
are
in
fact
members
of
the
organization.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
investigation
was
to
determine
whether
they
were
in
fact.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
correct.
he
did
not
refuse
to
--
i
might,
in
all
honesty
and
in
fairness,
i
might
indicate
that
the
petitioner
position
on
this
was
that
the
14
people
who
were
named
and
some
33
apparently
in
terms
of
--
where
there
was
no
reason
on
his
part
to
believe
or
to
disbelieve
the
committee
statement
that
were
in
fact
subversive,
he
proceeded
to
testify
and
to
indicate
as
to
whether
they
were
members
of
the
organization.
in
each
instance
as
i
indicated,
he
said,
“no,”
but
there
did
come
a
time
when
the
committee
named
a
particular
person,
reverend
graham
who's
in
a
companion
case
to
this
which
we
have
appended
as
appendix
b
in
our
brief,
in
our
petition
in
which
petitioner
asked
the
committee
why
this
statement
was
pertinent.
and
they
did
--
at
the
first
hearing,
they
refused
to
cont
--
to
carry
on
with
it
and
at
the
second
hearing
in
july
27th,
they
did
state
that
he
had
--
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
active
in
subversive
activities
but
petitioner
persisted
in
his
refusal
to
det
--
to
this
--
to
tell
them
whether
or
not
he
was
a
member
of
the
--
whether
or
not
he
was
a
member
of
the
organization.
but
i
suppose
that
the
more
accurate
statement
of
petitioner's
position
is
that
where
he
has
reason
to
doubt,
that
where
he
had
reason
to
doubt
that
what
the
committee
said
was
in
fact
true
with
respect
to
the
subversive
connections
of
these
particular
people
about
information
they
wanted
that
he
would
to
refuse
to
answer
but
where
he
had
no
reason
to
doubt
or
to
question
their
statement
then
he
was
answering
the
question
out
of
his
knowledge.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
yes.
i
--
yes,
i
think
that
in
the
context
of
this
particular
statute,
in
the
context
of
the
committee
hearing
and
the
purposes
for
which
the
committee
hearing
were,
subversive
means
communist
party.
it
does
not
mean
the
--
it
does
not
and
has
not
meant
in
terms
of
their
investigations
of
the
--
the
white
citizens
councils
or
the
fascist
organizations,
racist
organizations.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
there
has
never
been
any
allegation
here
by
anyone
here
that
--
with
respect
to
his
being
active
in
any
subversive
organization
at
all.
and
although
he
did
not
in
fact
make
a
statement
in
this
particular
--
and
in
this
particular
hearing
of
the
record,
the
record
on
there,
but
he
specifically,
he
had
in
prior
--
prior
times,
he
was
not
asked
that.
the
committee
--
in
fact,
the
committee
assumed
and
was
--
were
satisfied
that
he
himself
had
no
connection
with
any
subversive
organization.
now,
if
i
may
pick
up
the
thread
of
the
facts,
again,
the
petitioner
answered
as
to
these
14
and
was
for
whom
he
was
showed
pictures
and
then
he
was
--
there
was
a
name
of
--
names
some
30
people
--
33
of
people
and
as
the
counsel
for
the
committee
indicated
that
he
would
not
--
he
didn't
have
pictures
of
these
people
and
he
didn't
--
that
petitioner
might
not
recognize
a
name
and
therefore,
he
asked
him,
would
he
bring
the
membership
list
of
the
organization
to
the
committee
hearings
so
that
he
could
authenticate
his
testimony
in
respect
to
the
relationship
of
those
particular
persons.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
correct,
except
--
well
i
might
as
well
deal
with
it
now.
you
--
you
have
taken
me
--
you've
taken
me
a
little
bit
further
along
in
my
argument
than
i
have
point
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
than
i
had
planned
to
because
i
do
--
my
contention
is
that
once
the
membership
list
becomes
part
of
his
testimony
that
it
becomes
relevant
and
that
a
series
of
factors
become
--
or
put
in
motion
which
may
well
require
that
the
membership
list
be
produced.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
well
i
might
as
well
explain
it,
explain
this
now,
that
point.
i
think
that
our
contention
is
that
the
--
that
it
is
not
as
innocent
as
it
sounds
that
if
the
petitioner
comes
in
with
a
--
with
the
membership
list
and
has
that
at
his
feet
as
the
committee
says
that
they
want
him
to.
and
he's
asked
whether
john
jones
or
robert
young
or
so
forth
are
members
of
the
--
and
who
--
who
we
contend
are
members
of
the
communist
party
are
members
of
the
association
and
he
says,
“no,
they
are
not,”
then
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
put
in
motion
is
that
the
--
the
membership
list
becomes
relevant
because
the
committee
may
not
believe
that
he
is
telling
the
truth.
and
in
that
instance,
in
order
for
them
to
prove
that
he's
not
telling
the
truth,
the
membership
list
becomes
relevant
in
terms
of
the
--
the
disclosure
of
entire
membership
list
become
--
becomes
relevant
and
the
state
has
thereby
created
the
overriding
interest
to
get
the
list
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
has
committed
perjury
and
secondly,
it
becomes
relevant
insofar
as
the
petitioner
is
concerned
because
he
may
have
to
produce
it
in
order
to
defend
himself
against
the
charge
that
he
has
lied.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
agree
--
i
agree,
your
honor.
this
is
what
the
court
says
but
the
court
has
not
said
what
would
happen
in
the
next
step
when
the
committee
disbelieves
what
the
petitioner
is
testifying
to.
now,
the
--
the
court
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
not,
sir
because
i
think
that
what
we
have
is
that
we
have
to
determine
in
terms
of
whether
this
is
in
fact
a
violation
of
constitutional
right.
we
have
to
determine
i
think,
what
can
be
done
under
this
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
very
reasonable
and
logical
sequence
of
events
which
could
flow
from
his
producing
--
from
his
testifying
from
the
list.
because
i
think
the
list
then
becomes
relevant,
the
state
then
has
an
overriding
interest
which
it
does
not
have
we
contend
it
does
not
have
at
the
present
time.
so
that
i
think
that
by
he's
bringing
the
list
there,
the
state
has
produced
the
very
thing
which
would
make
it
possible
to
say
that
it
--
it
may
or
have
the
--
the
entire
membership
list
without
a
violation
of
the
(inaudible)
of
rights
or
a
violation
of
the
doctrine
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
mr.
justice
black,
my
contention
is
that
the
state
has
no
interest.
it
has
no
override
--
it
has
no
interest
at
all,
but
that
if
under
the
--
under
the
opinion
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
its
apparent
seeming
innocence,
if
the
petitioner
produces
the
membership
list
at
the
committee
hearing
in
order
to
testi
--
to
authenticate
his
answers
to
whether
or
not
various
persons
or
members
of
the
party
or
members
of
the
--
of
the
party
or
members
of
the
organization.
my
contention
is
that
a
sequence
of
the
events
are
put
in
motion
which
may
compel
the
production
of
the
list,
one
that
the
state
in
might
disbelieve
him
and
therefore
the
committee
in
terms
of
prosecuting
him
for
perjury
would
--
may
have
then
a
right
to
see
the
list
to
determine
whether
he's
lied
or
petitioner
in
order
to
defend
himself
against
charges
of
the
perjury
maybe
required
to
produce
the
list.
and
therefore,
my
argument
is
that
on
these
basis,
i
see
no
real
difference
between
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
saying
that
the
list
maybe
--
may
not
be
disclosed,
but
he
may
testify
from
it
and
the
actual
production
of
the
list,
which
this
court
forbade
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
will
--
i
--
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
finish
the
fact
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
you
insist
and
then
after
--
as
we
indicated,
he
was
--
he
refused
to
bring
the
list
in
and
he
was
ordered
to
do
so
and
he
persisted.
the
next
day,
i
think
the
hearing
closed
as
i
recall,
the
hearing
closed
that
day
and
the
next
day,
the
--
mr.
arlington
sands
was
produced
and
mr.
sands
testified
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
branch.
he
said
that
his
membership
--
rather
his
official
capacity
of
the
branch
predated
1950
that
he
didn't
really
know
whether
he
was
a
member
now
or
not.
he
hasn't
been
to
a
meeting
in
two
years.
as
he
began
to
testify
about
these
14
people
whom
the
investigator
had
indicated
were
members
of
the
communist
party
and
also
members
of
the
organization.
in
almost
every
instance
except
one,
he
indicated
that
he
did
not
know
whether
these
persons
were
members
of
--
were
members
of
a
subversive
group
and
were
members
of
the
naacp.
i
think
in
one
or
two
instances,
he
indicated
that
one
person
while
he
was
an
officer,
he
had
invited
him
to
attend
the
meeting
or
he
was
a
lawyer,
but
he
denied
the
fact
that
this
person
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
now,
we
contend
that
the
investigator
was
then
brought
back
to
impeach
this
testimony
and
it
was
indicated
that
the
investigator
had
talked
to
this
mr.
--
mr.
sands
at
the
wednesday
before
the
hearing
alone
in
a
room
with
him
and
that
therefore
it
was
--
what
he
said
was
his
word
against
the
other.
but
we
contend
therefore,
that
the
only
witness
produced
at
this
hearing
who
had
any
--
who
could've
had
any
personal
knowledge
about
the
facts
to
which
they
are
testifying
isn't
all
in
consent
that
it
is
clear
from
his
testimony
that
any
evidence
or
facts
that
he
had
predated
1950
and
that
therefore
that
the
people
about
whom
they
were
asking,
the
14
people
and
so
that
they
were
asking
him
about
were
persons
that
may
or
might
have
had
some
connection
with
the
organization
in
1950
or
before
1950
and
that
--
mr.
sands
had
himself
had
not
been
active
in
the
organization
since
that
time.
so
that
we
think
that
this
testimony
is
in
itself
insubstantial
in
--
to
provide
any
connection,
present
connection
and
for
that
matter
any
past
connection
between
the
organization
and
subversive
activity.
at
the
close
of
--
when
mr.
sands
was
finished,
there
were
several
other
witnesses
connected
with
the
organization
and
testified
and
were
shown
these
various
persons'
pictures
and
for
the
most
part,
they
did
not
having
seen
them
at
any
meetings.
they
all
denied
that
they
to
their
knowledge
that
they
knew
whether
these
persons
were
members
of
the
organization
and
in
some
instances
they
indicated
that
these
persons
might
--
that
they
might
have
seen
these
persons
at
meetings.
and
then
the
petitioner
was
brought
back
and
he
was
asked
how
the
anti-communist
policy
of
the
organization
was
implemented
and
he
pointed
out
investigations
that
were
made
of
officers
to
be
sure
that
there
are
no
officers
who
are
members
of
the
party,
who
are
the
officers
of
the
organization.
and
that
if
any
--
there's
any
evidence
of
any
person
being
engaged
in
any
activity,
any
rank
and
file
member
that
steps
were
taken
to
reject
that
person.
but
he
was
again
asked
to
produce
the
membership
list
for
the
first
purpose
of
authenticating
his
testimony
and
he
again
refused.
and
then
the
committee
as
the
statute
authorizes,
sought
a
rule
nisi
in
the
circuit
court
in
florida
to
require
the
person
--
the
petitioner
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
produce
the
membership
list.
and
there
was
a
hearing
at
that
--
on
that
order
to
show
cause
and
at
this
hearing,
the
petitioner
produced
evidence,
showing
that
the
disclosure
of
the
names
of
the
naacp
members
might
result
in
reprisals
and
harm,
economic
and
physical
harm,
attempted
to
proffer
testimony
into
--
indicating
that
the
persons
at
the
committee
whom
the
committee
was
interested
had
not
been
or
were
not
residents
of
florida
any
longer
and
that
the
committee
really
had
no
knowledge,
no
knowledge
in
its
--
or
no
evidence
in
its
files
that
these
persons
allegedly
communist
were
members
of
the
organization.
this,
the
court
refused
to
permit
interrogation
of
the
committee
chairman
and
the
investigator
for
the
committee
for
that
purpose
but
a
proffer
was
offered.
the
petitioner
was
ordered
to
appear
again
before
the
committee
and
to
give
the
evidence
and
the
petitioner
refused.
he
went
before
the
committee
but
again
refused
and
subsequent
to
that
there
was
a
hearing
he
was
convicted
of
contempt
on
sentences
i
have
indicated.
now,
on
appeal
to
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
committee
is
--
the
1959
statute
has
expired
but
the
committee's
life
was
reconstituted
in
the
1961
legislature
so
the
committee
is
still
active.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
affirmed
the
conviction
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
i
think
we
have
to
take
the
--
this
opinion
which
is
--
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
which
is
appended
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
its
prior
opinion
in
the
case
--
in
the
prior
case
here
which
--
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
florida
set
forth
the
framework
in
the
rational
on
which
it
required
the
production,
the
bringing
of
the
list
to
the
--
to
the
hearing.
supreme
court
of
florida
says
that
the
state
having
a
right
to
investigate
the
infiltration
of
communist
into
legitimate
organizations
that
this
gives
the
state
a
basis
for
demanding
the
names
of
the
persons
who
are
alleged
to
be
communist
as
to
whether
they
are
members
of
the
organization
different
from
what
is
the
present
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
and
that
in
order
to
protect
the
petitioner
and
organizations
that
there
will
be
no
demand
for
the
list
itself
and
that
all
that
the
petitioner
will
be
required
to
do
will
be
to
bring
the
list
and
validate
his
testimony
because
if
the
state
says
--
the
state
supreme
court
says
that
the
committee
cannot
get
the
list
and
there
will
be
no
necessity
for
the
list
to
be
filed.
now,
we
contend,
as
i
pointed
out
at
the
outset
that
there
is
no
legal
difference
between
this
case
and
the
naacp
versus
alabama.
we
think
that
the
rule
of
this
court
in
these
cases
is
that
the
state
must
show
an
overriding
interest
which
will
compel,
of
compelling
nature
in
order
for
the
state
to
be
able
to
intrude
upon
this
first
amendment
area.
our
contentions
are
that
no
such
overriding
interest
has
been
shown
in
this
particular
matter.
we
think
that
--
we
think
that
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
in
several
opinions
that
this
interest
cannot
be
simulated,
it
must
be
a
real
interest.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
there
is
no
finding
in
the
record
if
the
court
please,
but
we
think
that
it's
simulated
because
of
the
fact
that
we
think
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
a
sufficient
nature
to
show
that
insofar
as
the
particular
organization
is
concerned
that
there
isn't
any
real
evidence
of
any
communist
infiltration
to
the
organization.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
'we
don't
con
--
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
what
it
has
to
do
with
it
as
far
as
i
--
as
we
think
is
that
the
state,
as
we
understand
the
decisions
in
braden
and
wilkinson
that
if
the
state
may
investigate,
the
government
may
investigate
the
activity
of
subversives
into
legitimate
organizations,
what
we
understood
in
the
--
in
that
case
was
that
the
investigation
must
be
real
two,
that
it
must
be
for
a
valid
legislative
purpose
and
three,
there
must
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
--
these
kinds
of
inquiries
to
be
made.
now
as
far
as
we're
--
as
far
as
we
understand,
this
is
now
the
law
of
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
questions
that
were
asked
in
braden
and
wilkinson
were
their
own
connection
with
the
communist
party.
in
this
particular
instance,
there
has
been
no
evidence
that
the
petitioner
is
himself
a
communist
or
has
involved
in
any
way
in
any
connection
with
communist
organizations.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
think
that
--
let
me
--
let
me
answer
it
this
way,
if
the
court
please?
the
(inaudible)
for
me
on
the
facts
of
my
own
case
is
that
there
were
--
was
no
such
evidence
that
it
is
conceded
that
--
there
is
no
connection
with
subvers
--
with
subversion
by
this
petitioner.
there
is
also
no
evidence
that
the
organization
that
he
represents
is
in
fact
a
communist
front
organization.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
came
--
the
claim
is
a
--
is
a
peculiar
claim
if
the
court
please.
i
don't
think
that
that
claim
was
ever
really
made.
the
claim
was
that
they
wanted
to
--
that
they
thought
that
there
were
some
persons
who
were
--
that
there
had
been
some
communist
infiltration
at
the
organization
and
they
wanted
to
find
out
the
extent
of
it.
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
--
the
committee
as
i
understand
their
position
is
not
claiming
that
the
organization
had
been
infiltrated.
they
claimed
the
list
and
they
claimed
to
make
this
constant
inquires
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
is
so.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
so.
i
think
that's
exactly
--
that's
exactly
what
their
position
is.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
were
com
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
and
in
each
instance
and
so
far
as
--
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
mr.
justice
clark.
they
presented
an
investigator
who
testified
that
there
were
14
persons
who
on
his
investigation
which
--
were
shown
to
be
members
of
the
communist
party.
but
the
hearing
disclosed
as
i
think
quite
clearly
that
the
information
he
secured
was
from
an
arlington
sands
and
arlington
sands
testified
--
when
he
testified,
he
disclaimed
that
this
persons
were
communists
or
that
for
the
most
part
that
they
were
members
of
the
organization.
so
that
we
don't
really
have
any
clear,
valid,
in
my
judgment,
testimony
even
to
the
point
of
the
14
named
persons.
now
the
--
now
the
witness
did
--
the
petitioner
did
agree
and
did
answer
when
shown
with
the
pictures
of
these
14
persons.
he
did
indicate
these
persons
--
he
did
say
whether
or
not
he
knew
or
whether
these
persons
had
any
connection
with
the
organization.
in
each
instance
--
in
each
instance,
he
said,
“they
had
not”,
to
his
personal
knowledge.
but
that
he
refused
to
produce
the
membership
was
to
authenticate
his
testimony.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
i
could.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
as
i
understand
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wants
to
ask
is
that
if
in
a
civil
proceeding
the
membership
list
in
a
--
on
a
cross-examination,
there
was
an
order
to
require
the
production
of
the
membership
list
to
authenticate,
to
verify,
to
refresh
the
recollection
of
the
first
--
the
custodian
of
the
list
as
to
whether
under
these
circumstances
a
claim
could
be
had
under
the
--
under
naacp
versus
alabama,
is
that
correct?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
this
testimony
is
--
as
here,
that
he
testified
out
of
his
own
knowledge,
but
that
under
cross-examination
as
i
understand
it
which
would
be
the
place
of
the
committee
in
this
particular
instance
that
there
was
a
demand
for
the
list
in
order
to
be
sure
that
the
testimony
out
of
his
knowledge
was
true
and
there
--
therefore
there
was
a
--
for
recollection
purposes
and
that
there
was
no
demand
that
the
list
be
brought
in
but
that
it
be
produced
in
this
particular
instance.
i
--
i
will
say
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
this
is
a
--
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
--
a
very
difficult
question.
my
answer
to
it
--
of
course
i
will
answer
it
in
this
way,
i
don't
see
exactly
the
same
kind
of
consequences
which
would
come
from
this
--
from
the
testimony
of
this
particular
witness
under
cross-examination
and
as
would
occur
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
that
if
the
--
if
the
man
were
on
the
witness
stand,
the
custodian
to
authenticate,
to
refresh
his
recollection
with
the
protection
which
this
court
in
this
--
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
this
opinion
gives
that
they
cannot
be
produced,
it
would
seem
to
mean
that
at
that
point,
that
there
could
not
flow
the
consequences
that
i
fear
in
this
case,
that
the
whole
membership
list
could
thereafter
be
seized
on
--
in
--
in
further
prosecution
and
so
forth
on
--
for
perjury
of
--
for
--
or
that
the
--
sought
that
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
--
well,
i
think
if
--
if
the
court
please,
the
reason
that
i
take
the
next
step
is
that
i
think
that
we
have
to
examine
whether
or
not
there's
been
an
intrusion
of
first
amendment
rights
by
seeing
what
can
occur
under
this
--
under
this
--
under
these
consequences
not
only
in
this
particular
case,
not
only
can
the
--
well,
that
there'd
be
a
compulsion
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
to
--
to
make
on
--
there'll
--
there'll
be
a
compulsion
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
get
the
list
once
it
is
--
comes
in
--
it
comes
evidentiary.
but
there's
also
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
there
will
also
be
a
need
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
for
--
to
produce
the
list
because
he
would
--
in
order
to
defend
himself
against
the
next
step.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
would
like
to
take
that
position.
i
don't
think
that
the
--
i
don't
think
that
i
can
lead
that
into
the
alabama
decisions.
i
don't
think
that
--
the
reason
i
don't
think
i
can
take
that
position
is
because
of
the
fact
that
if
that
were
true,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
if
this
was
not
being
decided
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
the
court
having
decided
in
naacp
versus
alabama
would
not
have
granted
certiorari
and
heard
the
subsequent
cases
in
which
this
--
this
issue
was
ripe.
i
think
that
--
as
i
understand
the
alabama
case,
that
there
maybe
some
--
some
relevant
circumstances
in
which
the
--
the
court
might
find
that
there
would
be
a
requirement
to
produce
the
list.
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
all
i
can
do
is
in
terms
of
the
case
i
have
in
point,
i
don't
think
that
any
relevance
to
the
circumstances,
any
state
interest
is
present
here
which
would
warrant
a
departure
from
the
--
from
the
immunization
which
the
list
has
been
wracked
around
the
list
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
let
me
put
it
(inaudible)
--
let
me
put
(inaudible)
--
our
position
this
way
if
the
court
please.
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
has
any
power
to
compel
answers
to
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
the
--
of
the
petitioner
in
respect
to
whether
or
not
we
allege
such
in
such
a
persons
are
members
or
subversive
members
of
subversive
organization
and
that
therefore,
will
you
tell
whether
--
whether
they
are
or
not
members
of
the
organization.
our
contention
is
that
the
state
has
no
constitutional
authority
to
even
at
that
instance
compel
answers
to
that
--
to
that
particular
question
or
any
question
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir,
but
that
is
an
issue
in
answer
to
your
question
that
i
--
the
question
i
was
attempting
to
deal
with
that
you
raise
with
me.
now,
we
--
we
take
that
position
because
of
the
fact
that
we
--
we
say
that
without
a
showing
that
there
has
been
--
that
the
petitioner
himself
is
involved
in
subversion
or
that
the
organization
is
not
--
the
organization
is
that
there
is
no
--
that
they
can't
compel
that
answer
to
the
question
in
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
father
gibson
did
in
this
particular
instance
was
to
voluntary
--
volunteer
to
cooperate
with
the
committee,
but
when
the
committee
demanded
that
he
bring
his
membership
list
he
asserted
as
i
think
he
validly
may
the
--
the
right
freedom
of
association
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
that
also
is
a
difficult
question
for
me
to
answer.
i
would
think
not.
i
think
not.
i
think
that
--
personally,
but
i
think
that
the
cases
--
i
--
i
don't
think
that
i
can
rely
in
terms
of
that
--
on
these
cases.
as
i
read
the
cases,
they
are
based
upon
the
particular
facts,
particular
facts
which
are
relevant
in
the
south
and
they
have
been
applied
to
the
south.
and
then
--
and
i
think
that
the
court
has
made
a
claim
as
far
as
i
can
read
the
cases
that
if
the
situation
arose
in
oregon
or
some
other
place
with
--
where
the
particular
deterrence
which
would
occur
to
the
disclosure
of
the
membership
list
that
if
life
is
free
to
reach
a
different
conclusion.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
i
am
not
and
i
want
to
be
clear
that
i
am
not
here
advocating
my
position.
i
am
merely
attempting
to
state
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
state
what
this
court
--
what
i
think
this
court
has
held.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
i
don't
think
that.
not
white
people
--
certainly,
not
white
people
in
the
south
engaged
in
the
kind
of
activity
in
which
we
were
engaged
in
an
unpopular
--
in
an
unpopular
activity,
the
kind
of
which
we
were
engaged,
i
would
think
not.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
of
course
not,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
--
and
if
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
i
--
as
far
as
i
am
able
to
read
the
opinions
of
this
court.
i
would
--
i
would
before
--
i
think
that
i
would
come
to
that
conclusion.
i
think
that
--
as
i
understand
the
opinions
of
the
court,
the
facts
in
terms
of
the
reach
of
the
first
amendment,
the
facts
are
crucial.
and
where
the
facts
differ
then
the
--
the
issue
is
to
whether
--
whether
or
not
the
dangers
which
the
court
--
as
in
the
guarantee
which
the
court
seeks
to
protect
may
or
may
not
be
present
based
upon
--
upon
what
the
actual
facts
and
the
circumstances
are.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir,
right.
if
i
may
reach
the
few
minutes
i
have,
if
i
might
reach
the
question
that
you
asked
me
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
think
that
the
--
that
this
case,
in
my
judgment
differs
from
barenblatt
and
wilkinson
and
braden
on
the
one
hand
because
in
those
particular
instance,
the
question
which
was
asked
and
which
the
court
felt
--
this
court
felt
that
there
was
no
protection
against
was
whether
or
not
this
person
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
in
uphaus
on
the
other
hand
where
there
was
no
allegation
and
no
assertion
that
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
party,
although
there
was
disagreement
on
--
on
the
court,
the
majority
of
--
the
majority
found
that
there
was
relevant
facts
to
connect
the
world
fellowship
with
the
communist
party
and
therefore
to
give
grounds
for
the
state
seeking
the
entire
membership
list.
we
think
that
these
kinds
of
relevant
circumstances
and
relevant
facts
which
were
present
in
those
cases
are
not
present
here.
and
that
--
and
that
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
state
has
not
shown
that
there
is
any
reasonable
--
reason
--
reason
or
rational
reason
for
it
to
require
the
production
of
the
membership
list.
we
also
contend
if
the
court
please,
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
fact
that
this
committee,
this
investigation
has
been
going
on
since
1956,
committees
has
been
appointed
and
reappointed
until
--
in
1957
a
committee
was
appointed
and
--
and
in
1959,
a
committee
was
appointed
and
in
1961,
we
understand
a
new
committee
has
been
reconstituted.
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
--
we
contend
that
out
of
all
these
appointments
of
the
committee's
investigation,
no
valid
legislation
has
been
enacted.
and
we
contend
that
there
is
no
valid
legislation
which
can
come
by
virtue
of
the
investigation
which
this
committee
has
under
--
undertaken
particularly
or
--
or
especially
i
might
add
in
respect
to
the
--
to
the
--
to
the
membership
in
this
--
in
the
particular
organization
which
is
before
the
court.
we
--
as
we
understand
the
--
the
law
in
this
area,
the
free
speech
in
the
--
in
the
free
speech
area
that
although
an
investigation
of
subversive
activities
may
be
made
that
the
--
that
the
investigation
cannot
be
an
end
in
itself
to
merely
feed
on
itself
and
this
be
subjective
that
there
has
to
be
--
it
has
to
be
for
some
valid
purpose.
there
has
to
be
for
some
remedial
legislation
that
has
to
be
made
for
some
--
some
--
some
aim
or
some
interest
which
the
state
has
a
right
to
attempt
to
legislate
about
and
we
are
--
we
contend
that
that
this
not
--
not
present
here.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
i
don't
--
i
didn't
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
what
i
meant
to
say
--
what
i
should
have
said
more
clearly
was
as
i
understand
that
this
court's
opinion
in
uphaus
was
that
there
was
evidence
in
showing
not
just
members
of
--
that
the
world
fellowship
had
communist
in
it,
but
there
was
evidence
of
--
a
connective
link
between
it
and
the
--
and
the
communist
party
or
evidence
on
which
the
--
it
held
that
the
state
had
a
right
to
believe
that
there
was
a
connective
link
between
the
world
fellowship
to
the
organization
involved
and
the
communist
party.
we
contend
that
there
is
no
such
evidence
of
any
connective
link
in
this
particular
case.
and
i
said
before
and
i
--
i
would
stand
on
that
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
connective
link
is
demonstrated
by
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
person
is
a
member
--
who
--
who
is
allegedly
a
member
of
--
of
the
communist
party
is
a
member
of
the
organization
that
the
connective
link
has
to
be
in
terms
of
the
organization's
activities
which
are
in
conformity
with
the
aims
of
the
--
of
the
communist
party
of
the
sub
--
or
subversion.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
there
is
a
--
there
is
this
--
there
is
a
claim
to
that
effect,
mr.
justice
black,
but
we
--
we
don't
believe
that
the
claim
has
been
substantiated
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
true
that
they
were
trying
to
prove
it
by
asking
the
custodian
of
the
list
they
had
a
--
and
they
had
a
person
who
they
said
apparently
they
produced
as
a
witness
who
had
personal
or
purported
to
have
--
who
they
thought
had
personal
knowledge
of
it.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
if
the
court
please,
if
they
wanted
to
find
out
whether
persons
are
members
of
the
--
or
whether
they
are
subversives
in
the
organization
that
the
--
the
direct
thing
to
do
is
to
find
the
persons
and
ask
them.
they
had
a
list
of
the
names
of
these
people.
they
were
stating
that
they
were
members
of
the
organization.
if
these
were
true
--
if
they
were
--
these
were
in
fact
true,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
whole
controversy
in
respect
before
the
gibson
is
--
is
a
kind
of
a
futility.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
they
could
ask
the
witness
themselves
as
to
whether
they
were
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
they
made
no
--
in
this
particular
hearing,
they
didn't
bring
any
persons
to
that
extent.
as
i
indicated,
the
person
that
they
did
bring
had
no
--
this
--
who
had
been
at
one
time
a
member
of
the
--
of
the
naacp
disputed
their
testimony.
i
--
well,
i
think
i
had
better
leave
the
--
the
one
point
i
would
like
to
make
before
i
do
sit
down
and
that
is
that
the
--
i
think
that
where
the
--
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
this
investigation
can
be
made
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
whether
persons
are
named
by
the
committee
to
be
subversive
that
this
place
is
in
terms
of
pertinency,
this
place
is
an
intolerable
--
intolerable
burden
on
the
petitioner
because
there
are
no
objective
standings
by
which
he
can
determine
whether
he
can
answer
the
question
or
not.
if
the
committee
says
that
a
particular
person
is
a
subversive,
he
either
accepts
that
or
--
and
refuses
--
or
refuses
to
answer
at
his
own
risk
because
if
it
later
turns
out
that
the
committee
does
have
evidence,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
he
would
be
in
contempt.
this
is
not
the
degree
or
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
pertinency
where
it
must
--
must
be
--
must
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
some
objective
fact
where
the
petitioner
or
the
witness
is
able
to
make
a
determination
and
will
not
be
--
that
he
will
have
to
make
it
up
on
his
mind
or
his
belief
and
what
he
believes
in.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
if
i
may
--
because
i
think
that
the
statement
that
mr.
hawes
made
really
succinctly
places
the
problem
before
the
court.
mr.
hawes
says
that
the
committee
doesn't
want
to
stop
every
time
if
they
asked
whether
a
person
is
a
member
of
the
party
and
the
person
decides
to
stand
on
his
constitutional
rights,
but
it
seems
to
us,
if
the
court
please
that
this
is
the
--
this
is
a
particular
issue
here.
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
guarantees
remain
make
--
that
the
committee
cannot
violate
the
constitutional
guarantees
and
cannot
freely
violate
constitutional
guarantees
is
the
very
reason
for
this
court.
and
that
--
therefore,
in
this
particular
case,
as
we
pointed
out,
we
think
that
we
had
demonstrated
that
we
think
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
demonstrates
that
there
is
no
reasonable
connection
between
the
demand
for
this
--
for
what
is
being
demanded
in
any
legislative
purpose
that
the
--
that
this
committee
is
--
is
investigating
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
certain
persons
alleged
to
be
members
of
the
communist
party
or
members
of
the
--
of
the
organization.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
do
they
do
with
this
information.
can
they
pass
a
law
barring
that
members
of
the
communist
party
be
in
the
organization?
if
in
fact
the
--
what
they
have
to
do
in
order
to
--
to
attack
the
organization
and
to
lay
a
foundation
for
making
the
kind
of
investigation
which
i
think
--
which
i
--
as
i
understand
that
the
decisions
of
this
court,
there
would
have
to
be
some
showing
that
the
organization
itself
is
involved
in
some
kind
of
activity
of
this
kind.
now,
as
we
attempted
to
point
out
in
this
brief
and
show
to
the
comm
--
i
mean
in
--
for
all
these
hearings
and
show
to
the
committee
the
organization,
as
most
organizations
of
its
kind
were
--
attempted
to
take
care
of
the
--
of
the
problems
within
it
by
the
resolutions
which
--
which
were
adopted
and
by
following
it,
implementing
it
and
therefore,
being
sure
that
there
were
no
subversives
in
the
organization.
the
testimony
in
the
record
reveals
that
the
persons
who
were
in
charged
with
this,
with
--
and
implementing
these
resolutions
stated
that
there
are
no
communists
in
the
miami
branch
and
that
they
have
no
evidence
of
any
being
there.
now,
all
the
committee
wants
to
do
is
to
--
and
we
think
that
this
is
--
what
the
committee
wants
to
do
in
this
particular
instance
is
to
attempt
to
have
the
--
father
gibson
come
before
the
committee
with
the
membership
list
and
an
announcement
made
that
the
committee
has
had
possession
of
the
list
and
we
think
that
this
doesn't
fair
with
the
naacp
versus
alabama
case
situation
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right,
sir,
which
were
authenticated
via
testimony
whether
these
people
are
members
of
--
by
--
by
the
record.
that's
the
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
as
i
understand
the
uphaus
--
the
uphaus
case,
the
majority
--
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
disagreement
as
i
understand
it
between
the
majority
and
the
minority
on
what
the
facts
meant.
but
as
i
understand
uphaus,
the
majority
held
and
therefore
held
that
the
membership
list
was
not
privileged
because
the
majority
held
that
there
had
been
established
in
the
record
a
rational
basis
to
believe
for
the
state
to
believe
that
there
was
a
connection
between
the
world
fellowship
and
the
--
and
the
communist
party.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
connection
that
i
--
as
i
see
--
saw
in
the
--
as
i
understand
the
opinion,
the
connection
was
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
there
were
speakers
had
or
the
speakers
who
had
been
invited
were
allegedly
members
of
the
communist
party
to
address
this
group
that
some
of
the
members
who
had
been
--
who
themselves
was
allegedly
they're
communist
on
this
--
this
is
on
the
testimony
of
--
of
various
witnesses.
the
other
distinction,
if
i
may,
was
that
the
--
the
guest
list
itself,
as
i
understand
mr.
justice
clark's
opinion,
the
guest
list
was
required
to
be
made
public.
and
that
insofar
as
the
court
held
and
insofar
as
the
guest
list
was
concerned
that
the
--
the
protection
which
--
which
the
--
which
was
being
claimed
had
been
given
up
at
the
very
outset
because
they
were
required
to
disclose
it,
but
the
main
difference
is
--
as
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
because
there
has
been
dis
--
it
required
to
disclose
it
under
--
the
quest
list
was
required
to
be
given
and
its
given
to
the
sheriff
and
public
law
enforcement
officials
under
new
hampshire
law
so
that
--
this
was
another
difference
between
the
two
cases.
now,
i'm
saying
that
in
that
particular
case
that
there
is
no
nexus
between
the
party,
the
communist
party
and
the
--
and
the
naacp
established
in
this
record.
there
has
been
allegations
made
that
the
--
there
are
some
persons
involved
who
are
in
it,
but
--
but
the
allegations
i
--
we
submit
are
insubstantial
because
the
allegations
are
in
dispute
even
by
the
committee's
own
witnesses
and
that
therefore
we
think
that
the
--
the
link
which
uphaus
held
was
necessary
or
was
--
would
require
a
break
with
the
naacp
versus
alabama
is
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
--
i
--
i
could
say
that
--
what
i
think
i
meant
to
say,
if
the
court
please,
i
thought
that
they
had
no
right
in
answer
to
the
hypothetical
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter
put
to
me,
i
indicated
that
i
didn't
believe
that
it
was
a
valid
question
that
could
be
asked
as
to
whether
we
say
that
such
and
such
a
person
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
is
he
a
member
of
the
organization?
i
contend
that
this
is
not
a
valid
question
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
ask
in
--
in
circumstances
of
this
particular
case.
i
contend
of
course,
that
they
can't
prove
that
there
is
any
nexus
between
the
organization
and
the
--
and
the
naacp,
but
i
think
what
i
have
to
argue
here
is
the
worst
kind
of
circumstances
in
which
they
can
prove
in
this
particular
case
and
the
worst
kind
of
circumstance
i
think
they
can
prove
is
on
their
own
evidence.
the
evidence
is
not
--
is
not
evidence
in
which
there
can
be
any
support.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think
that
--
that
the
facts
are
that
an
investigator,
a
person
who
investi
--
who
are
alleged
to
be
investigator,
who
was
shown
to
have
talked
to
the
witness
saying
--
testified
that
his
--
his
evidence
showed
that
these
people
were
--
were
members
of
the
organization.
but
sands
himself,
the
personal
witness
came
on
the
witness
stand
and
testified,
one,
that
most
of
these
people
were
not
members
of
the
communist
party
to
his
own
knowledge
and
two,
that
they
were
not
members
of
the
organization.
so
that
our
--
our
contention
is
that
the
--
the
evidentiary
basis
which
they
were
attempting
to
establish
has
been
taken
away
from
them
by
their
own
witness.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court.
in
this
case,
we're
asking
the
court
to
review
the
constitutional
validity
of
a
contempt
conviction
of
petitioner
with
who
has
been
adjudged
in
the
contempt
of
court
and
sentenced
to
six
months
imprisonment,
$400
fine
and
six
months
additional
if
the
fine
is
not
paid,
for
his
refusal
to
abide
by
a
court
order
which
would
require
him
to
bring
before
the
florida
legislative
investigation
committee,
the
respondents
here,
to
verify
his
answers
as
to
their
questions
about
alleged
communists
who
were
supposedly
be
members
of
the
petitioner's
organization
which
happens
to
be
the
minor
branch
of
the
naacp.
petitioner
contends
that
in
his
basis
refusal
to
submit
to
the
order
of
the
court
and
to
the
order
of
the
committee
contends
that
this
matter
was
foreclosed
by
naacp
versus
alabama.
and
that
for
this
reason,
that
the
order
of
the
court
below
which
would
require
him
not
to
give
up
the
entire
membership
list
or
to
authenticate
his
answers
by
reference
thereto
is
in
substance
a
--
or
cannot
be
sustained
for
--
on
the
grounds
of
the
theory
of
this
court
in
the
naacp
versus
alabama.
for
that
reason,
he
has
refused
to
submit
to
this
and
the
--
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
this
matter
has
been
brought
here.
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief,
this
--
for
this
court
on
page
2,
the
law
under
which
the
investigation
committee
acts.
it
is
investigating
by
the
--
in
florida,
the
activities
of
organizations
and
the
persons
engaged
in
act
of
violence
or
advocating
a
course
of
conduct
which
would
constitute
a
violation
of
florida
law.
pursuant
to
this,
the
--
there
was
an
investigation
of
the
activities
of
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
colored
people
in
florida.
the
present
act
before
the
court
is
chapter
59-207
of
the
laws
of
florida
of
1959
by
the
transcendence
or
statute
which
was
enacted
in
1956
and
this
committee
was
organized.
the
committee
was
reconstituted
in
1957
and
reestablished
in
1959
and
i
believe
mr.
hawes
can
verify
this
that
the
committee
as
--
was
reestablished
in
the
1961
legislature.
now,
in
our
judgment,
what
the
--
what
was
occurred
in
the
--
before
the
committee
on
november
the
5th
and
4th
--
and
the
5th,
of
1959,
was
that
the
petitioner
who
was
the
custodian
of
the
membership
list
of
the
miami
organization,
was
called
before
the
committee
and
before
he
testified,
there
was
a
testimony
of
an
investigator
for
the
committee
who
indicated
that
there
were
some
14
persons
will
be
named
who
he
indicated
that
he
knew
or
believed
to
be
members
of
the
communist
party
and
also
members
of
the
miami
branch
of
the
naacp.
the
petitioner
himself
was
called
and
was
asked
as
to
whether
he
would
--
was
prepared
to
be
brought
--
had
he
brought
a
membership
list
to
be
required,
he
had
not
--
wasn't
prepared
to
answer
questions
concerning
the
identification
or
association
of
those
persons
with
the
organization.
this
he
refused
to
do.
he
indicated
to
the
committee
that
he
would
answer
any
questions
from
his
own
knowledge
as
to
the
membership
of
the
alleged
communists,
the
14
persons'
name
with
the
organization
but
refuse
to
bring
the
association's
membership
list
to
verify
his
answers.
on
the
next
day,
a
--
and
this
is
--
i
think
this
is
an
important
issue
or
fact
here
because
our
contentions
will
be
in
this
case
that
there
must
be
some
predicate
for
the
inquiry.
the
next
day
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
some
predicate,
some
basis
for
making
the
inquiry
of
the
court
--
and
the
committee,
we
submit
must
justify
the
fact
that
it
is
making
this
kind
of
inquiry
of
this
organization
must
have
some
facts
upon
which
it
can
predicate
a
belief.
we
believe
that
there
is
subversion
is
going
on
that
these
--
it
is
infiltrated
by
subversion.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
think
that
there
is
no
proof
in
this
record
which
would
be
sufficient
to
establish;
one
--
and
although
we
don't
have
to
make
this
contention
but
we
think
the
record
is
clear,
one,
as
to
whether
those
persons
were
in
fact
members
of
the
communist
party
and
two,
as
to
whether
they
were
members
of
the
naacp
and
the
--
on
the
hearing,
under
the
court
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
--
yes.
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
if
i
make
myself
clear,
that
what
i'm
trying
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
this
would
be
my
next
basis.
i
would
seem
to
feel
but
what
--
would
have
to
be
shown
in
order
for
this
kind
of
inquiry
to
be
made
in
fact,
would
be
a
showing
that
there
was
some
activity
on
the
part
of
the
organization,
some
link
on
the
part
of
the
organization
with
communists
or
with
subversion
before
this
association
to
privacy
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
would
think
--
my
feelings
would
be
that
there
has
to
be
some
activity,
some
activity
on
the
part
of
the
organization.
i
say
this
and
i
might
well
finish
answering
the
question,
although
you
have
pushed
me
far
along
in
my
argument.
i
say
this
--
i
say
this
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
is
not
so
then
the
--
then
in
other
words,
if
you
can
merely
establish
that
a
and
b
are
members
of
the
communist
party
and
the
inquiry
can
be
made
as
to
whether
they
are
in
fact
members
of
the
organization
and
the
state
can
demand
that
you
bring
your
membership
list
and
refer
to
it,
what
it
means
is,
that
you
are
forced
to
place
your
own
custodian
of
the
list,
his
own
freedom
from
contempt
and
the
association
of
privacy
of
members
on
something
about
which
he
would
no
way
of
knowing
whether
it
is
true
or
not.
in
other
words,
he
does
--
it
may
well
develop
that
he
would
believe
that
certain
a
and
b
are
not
members
of
the
communist
party
but
they
might
be
proved
to
be
so.
so,
that
he
has
no
basis
upon
which,
a
solid
basis
upon
which
to
assert
the
freedom
of
association
of
the
members
of
the
naacp,
which
was
established
in
the
naacp
versus
alabama.
and
for
this
reason,
we
think
that
this
would
put
the
custodian
of
the
list
in
an
improbable
position
and
would
undercut
completely
the
basis
for
the
--
for
which
was
established
and
we
think
correctly
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
there
was
testimony
by
an
investigator
which
indicated
that
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
a,
b,
(inaudible)
num
--
names
of
14
people
that
we
named
were
engaged
in
communist
activities
in
the
state
of
florida
and
are
members
of
the
association.
two,
that
33
people
who
merely
were
named,
are
members
of
the
naacp
and
the
communist
party.
the
witness
in
which
was
the
investigators,
the
witness
from
whom
the
committee
apparently
thought
it
would
substantiate
this
information
was
a
man
named
arlington
sands,
who
appeared
the
next
day.
mr.
sands
was
inquired
--
it
was
--
inquiry
was
made
of
him
as
to
these
14
persons
and
at
--
in
most
instances,
he
indicated,
one,
i
don't
know
whether
this
person
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
i've
never
seen
him
at
any
naacp
meeting
or
he
said
that
in
one
instance
a
person
named
shyane
he
says,
i
--
he
was
a
member
of
the
naacp
because
i
invited
them
there
but
i
don't
believe
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
mr.
sands
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
and
one
other
point,
if
i
may
say.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
mr.
sands
was
a
--
as
the
record
discloses,
was
in
1949
had
been
a
vice-president
of
the
miami
branch,
he
indicate
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
of
the
naacp,
yes
sir.
he
indicated
that
he
had
not
been
active
in
the
organization
since
that
time
that
he
had
not
been
a
member
of
the
organization
over
the
last
couple
of
years.
so
that
two
things
were
established,
we
think
in
these
terms
of
his
testimony
that
all
of
these
persons
who
--
the
link
was
spread
out
on
the
record,
even
if
they
had
been
established
that
they
were
members
of
the
organization,
since
this
was
of
--
attempt
was
made
to
verify
by
it
by
sands,
were
persons
whose
membership
dated
back
to
1949
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
membership
since
--
prior
--
since
that
time.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
there
--
as
to
the
14.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
there
was
some
statement
about
--
there
was
some
statement
about
33,
but
when
mr.
sands
testified
as
he
did,
and
apparently
surprised
the
committee
in
terms
of
his
testimony
in
regards
to
the
14,
he
was
--
no
further
inquiry
was
made
of
him
as
to
the
--
of
the
other
persons.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
and
what
i'm
trying
to
establish
which
i
think
is
important
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
record
--
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record,
independent
evidence
in
this
record,
that
anybody
named
as
a
communist
or
alleged
to
be
a
communist
was
a
member
of
the
naacp
at
any
time.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
this
--
the
evidence
on
this
point
mr.
justice
goldberg
was
that
in
1950,
the
naacp
had
adopted
an
anti-communist
resolution
baring
persons
from
the
organization.
all
of
the
resolutions
on
that
fact
up
to
1959
was
submitted
to
the
committee
and
because
at
the
last
argument
here,
counsel
for
the
committee
seemed
to
me
to
have
given
the
court
an
erroneous
conclusion
as
to
the
--
what
was
in
the
resolutions
passed
since
1950.
we
have
those
resolutions
prejudiced
so
that
the
court
could
itself
see
exactly
the
resolutions
which
had
been
adopted
by
the
national
organization
beginning
with
1950
through
1962.
the
committee
itself
had
and
was
presented
in
1959,
all
the
resolutions
which
we
have
adopted,
the
resolutions
up
to
that
point.
now,
it
is
our
--
it's
the
--
the
petitioner
told
the
committee
that
he
had
been
present
at
the
branch
for
five
years,
that
there
were
1000
members
in
it,
that
pointed
out
to
them
the
resolution
that
has
been
adopted,
a
policy
of
the
organization,
and
indicated
that
he
himself
was
aware
of
no
communist
infiltration
into
the
organization
at
all.
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
organization
had
taken
a
very
strong
policy
on
this
and
had
made
an
effort
to
keep
out
alleged
communist
and
keep
itself
free
of
this
kind.
the
committee
demanded
that
he
bring
the
list
and
on
this
there
was
this
refusal,
the
matter
then
went
to
court
on
a
--
pursuant
to
the
statute
and
evidence
was
adduced
in
the
court
to
show
that
the
deterrent
effect
on
the
disclosure
and
the
policies
of
the
organization
and
a
proffer
was
made
in
court
which
the
court
refused
to
show
that
the
committee
itself
had
no
knowledge
of
any
communist
infiltration
into
the
organization
and
that
most
of
the
persons
who
had
been
named
were
persons
that
no
longer
lived
in
florida,
but
this
proffer,
this
offer
of
evidence
was
refused.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
hope
you
are,
i
did
not
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
did
not
--
i
don't
believe
that
i've
made
a
statement
of
that
kind
because
my
whole
argument
has
to
be
predicated
on
the
belief
that
the
only
purpose
that
could
be
served
by
this
is
the
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i'm
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
am
certainly
going
to
be
corrected
sir
but
i
don't
believe
that
i
could
have
made
a
statement
as
to
that.
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it's
not
my
position
your
honor.
we
--
what
i
may
have
said
–
what
i
may
have
said
sir,
was
that
i
felt
that
the
investigation
that
this
committee
was
making
an
investigation
by
virtue
of
decisions
of
this
court
of
communist
infiltration
in
some
organizations,
as
i
understood
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
wilkinson
and
braden,
i
may
have
indicated
that
the
--
that
this
was
a
--
could
be
a
legitimate
activity
on
the
part
of
the
legislative
committee.
our
view
of
course
is
on
this,
and
i
think
this
was
set
out
in
our
brief
that
this
investigation
was
leading
to
no
purpose
was
based
upon
no
valid
legis
--
had
no
valid
legislative
purpose
at
all
and
i
am
reasonably
sure
that
this
had
been
set
out
quite
clearly,
this
point
has
been
set
out
in
our
--
both
in
our
petition's
brief
that
the
committee
had
been
in
existence
since
1956
and
that
our
view
is
that
the
only
thing
the
committee
is
doing
is
an
effort
to
smear
the
organization
by
linking
it
or
attempt
to
link
it
with
communism.
now,
we
have
set
out
in
the
--
at
the
--
in
the
appendix
b
to
the
petition
that
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
graham
versus
florida,
which
is
a
companion
case,
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
that
opinion
accepts
the
fact
that
exposure
of
persons
who
belonged
to
the
naacp
would
have
a
deterrent
effect
upon
their
freedom
of
association
and
accepts
the
thesis
we
believe
that
the
association
is
a
legitimate
organization.
it
took
the
view
however,
that
the
state
in
investigating
communism
that
this
provided
the
state
with
an
overriding
interest
which
would
entitle
it
to
demand
of
the
custodian
not
that
he
give
up
the
list
and
this
i
think
is
the
distinction
between
this
that
--
between
their
case
and
the
naacp
versus
alabama,
not
that
the
entire
list
to
be
given
off
but
that
merely
that
the
custodian
list
it
required
to
come
to
the
committee
hearing
and
to
authenticate
by
reference
to
the
membership
list,
his
answers
to
questions
as
to
the
statement
of
the
legislative
--
legislators
that
an
alleged
communist
is
a
member
of
your
organization
and
we
want
you
to
look
at
the
list
and
tell
us
whether
he
is
or
is
not
a
member
of
the
association.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
this
is
the
purport
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
but
the
problem
with
that
mr.
justice
harlan
is
that
it
seems
to
me
as
i
--
in
answer
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
asked,
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
undercuts
completely
the
basis
for
the
refusal
to
disclose
the
membership
was
--
by
that
was
established
in
the
naacp
versus
alabama
because
it
thus
seems
to
me
that
if
a
person
can
be
required
to
disclose
the
–
to
refer
to
the
list,
name
a
name
as
to
whether
person
is
a
member
on
the
grounds
that
a
committee
has
said
to
him,
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
such
and
such
a
person
is
a
member
of
communist
party,
then
it
seems
to
me,
sir,
that
no
person
could
with
any
security
refuse
to
name
any
man
that
the
committee
would
ask.
with
that
predicate
then
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
john
doe
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
would
you
refer
to
your
membership
list
to
let
us
know
whether
he's
a
member
of
your
organization
and
we
think,
if
your
honor
please,
that
this
would
simply
mean
that
naacp
versus
alabama
would
have
no
foundation
at
all.
this
would
be
a
reversal
in
fact
of
what
we
understand
to
be
the
basis
of
that
decision.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
because
of
the
fact
that
what
he
is
testifying
from
his
oral
--
then
--
from
his
memory
without
reference
to
the
list,
he's
testifying
as
an
individual
as
other
individuals
were
called
upon
to
testify.
he
does
not
bring
into
court
the
organization,
the
membership
list
and
he
does
not
bring
into
any
conflict
or
jeopardy
at
all
the
right
of
freedom
of
association
of
other
members
of
the
organization
who
--
they're
on
the
membership
list.
he
is
indicating
out
of
his
own
knowledge
that
--
and
he
says
that
any
person
could
be
called
upon
to
say,
to
cooperate
and
indicate
that
i
know
such
and
such
a
person
is
a
member
of
the
list.
i
mean
as
a
member
of
the
naacp.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
called
to
that
point
but
i
was
--
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
and
questioned
me
in
regard
to
that.
we
think
that
the
only
sound
basis
for
allowing
an
invasion
of
privacy
which
had
been
sustained
by
this
court
in
this
regard
is
on,
one,
a
showing
an
overriding
state
interest
which
would
have
to
be
established.
we
think
that
the
overriding
state
interest
which
the
state
would
have
--
would
establish
in
this
particular
case
would
have
to
be
that
--
it
was
that
this
committee
would
be
investigating
communist
infiltration
into
organizations
that
the
disclosure
of
the
names
or
the
requirement
by
the
person
testifies
to
the
membership
list
and
therefore
constructively
at
least
discloses
the
names
would
have
to
be
related
to
a
valid
legislative
objective.
we
think
that
this
was
the
basis
for
this
court's
decision
in
the
naacp
versus
alabama
and
we
think
that
this
--
it
should
be
adhered
to.
now,
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
to
punish
for
--
to
make
it
a
crime?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir,
i
would
believe
that
would
be,
yes
sir.
but
in
order
for
the
court,
for
the
legislative
committee
to
use
that
objective
in
terms
of
the
disclosing
of
the
membership
list
of
an
organization
otherwise
illegitimate,
it
would
seem
to
me
you
would
have
to
show
that
this
organization
in
it
--
is
itself
in
terms
of
its
activity
promoting
violence
in
this
regard.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
sufficient
because
if
the
committee
--
i
mean,
if
the
state
merely
says
that
communists
are
promoting
violence
and
therefore
we
want
to
know
whether
they
are
members
of
your
organization,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
they
can
make
any
kind
of
statement
and
secure
--
totally
secure
the
membership
list
which
this
court
has
held
that
it
is
a
right
of
freedom
of
association.
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
that
the
state's
justification
has
to
be
based
upon
something
real
and
effective,
something
that's
--
it
has
to
have
a
basis
for
it,
and
this
basis
it
seems
to
me
if
the
court
please,
would
have
to
be
the
activities
of
the
particular
organization.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
only
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
only
in
terms
of
the
organization
if
they
can
establish
that
the
organizations
and
they
want
to
pierce
the
freedom
of
association
which
this
court
has
set
up,
is
that
those
organizations
are
engaged
in
some
activity
along
this
line.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
justified
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
sound
for
this
court
to
adopt
the
principle
that
an
organization
--
that
the
legislature
is
concerned
about
the
infiltration
of
persons
that
were
interested
in
promoting
violence
and
it
says
that
we
have
the
names
of
x
people
who
were
interested
in
or
concerns
of
violence
and
want
to
infiltrate
the
govana's
club,
let's
say
and
therefore,
this
court
would
hold
--
would
uphold
the
right
of
the
state
and
the
legislature
to
say
–
tell
the
govana's
club
that
you
have
to
disclose
to
us
the
names
of
every
member
of
your
organization
because
of
this
factor.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
if
the
freedom
of
--
the
first
amendment
rights
means
that
their
protection
had
with
the
meaning,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
freedom
of
association
of
the
members
of
the
particular
organization
is
protected
provided
that
the
organization
is
involved
in
legitimate
activity.
this
is
what
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
mean.
now,
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
that,
i
think
that
what
the
court
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
weigh
the
evidence
of
the
illegitimate
activities
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
nexus
obtained
of
the
legitimate
--
the
legitimacy
of
the
organization
before
it
would
be
able
to
make
--
to
allow
the
kind
of
inquiry
which
this
court
--
which
this
--
is
being
asked
for
here.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
mr.
justice
white,
that
if
they're
asking
about
activity,
we're
talking
about
the
names
of
members,
if
they're
asking
about
activities,
that's
an
entirely
different
thing
because
it
would
seem
to
me,
perfectly
legitimate,
for
the
legislative
committee
to
inquire
of
father
gibson
or
anyone
else
connected
with
the
organization
that
is
brought
before
them
as
to
what
kind
of
activity
your
organization
has
been
involved
in,
what
has
it
done.
has
it
--
let's
say
that,
in
any
kind
of
communist,
a
subversive
activity
to
inquire
us
to
whether
they
have
done
this.
this
would
not
involve
in
my
judgment
the
same
kind
of
problem
which
has
involved
in
the
present
before
the
court
when
they're
not
asking
that.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
so.
but
they
asked
the
secretary
to
--
do
you
have
any
communist
in
the
organization
and
i
think
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
asked
father
gibson
that
and
totally
he
did
not,
he
knew
of
none.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
here
are
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir,
because
i
think
that
when
you
come
to
that
point,
if
you
ask
--
if
you
come
to
that
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
really
doing
is
in
terms
of
rank
and
file,
rank
--
the
rank
and
file
members
of
the
organization
who
have
pierced
the
association
of
privacy
which
has
been
protected.
and
it
seems
to
me
also
that
if
in
terms
of
the
legitimate
activities
that
the
organization
was
involved
and
if
it
is
attended,
if
it
is
related
to
something
that
the
disclosure
would
help
the
state
to
pursue
a
valid
objective,
of
course
it
can
be.
but
we
think
that
all
of
the
state
has
hidden,
has
said
as
we
believe
--
that
you
--
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
certain
number
of
people
in
your
organizations
are
communists
therefore,
you
bring
your
membership
list
and
let
us
know
about
it.
they'll
get
--
they
go
from
14
and
as
the
evidence
in
this
case
disclose,
they
had
went
from
14
and
on
the
last
hearing,
they
went
to
another
person.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
[inaudible]
mr.
robert
l.
carter
at
the
close
of
the
argument
yesterday,
mr.
justice
white
raised
the
question
and
asked
me
to
address
myself
to
it,
on
today.
i
can’t
repeat
the
question
in
words,
but
the
burden
of
it
as
i
understood
it
was
whether
why
was
it
not
in
the
interest
of
the
organization
to
verify
the
fact
that
the
person’s
name,
that
alleged
the
communists
were
not
in
memphis
and
therefore
to
give
the
testimony
requested.
the
reason
that
this
was
not
done
and
i
think
that
the
record
is
clear,
the
reading
of
the
record
makes
clear
that
these
14
persons
named
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
membership
in
the
organization
has
only
existed
for
one
year
and
it’s
obvious
that
these
persons
that
were
--
supposed
persons
were
named
or
persons
that
if
they
had
any
connection
with
the
organization
at
all,
would
have
been
predated
1950.
the
reason
that
this
was
not
done
is
because
of
the
fact
that
petitioner
believed
that
he
would
place
in
jeopardy
the
constitutional
right
of
freedom
of
association
and
the
privacy
in
that
association
which
this
court
protected
and
secured
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
now,
the
issue
that
comes
down
to
it
is
if
--
that
if
the
petitioner
answers
that
the
question,
where
will
he
stop?
the
next
question
will
be
a
list
of
negro
school
teachers
and
proffered
with
the
statement
that
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
these
persons
are
members
of
the
communist
party,
will
you
verify
as
to
whether
they
are
members
of
your
organization
or
ministers
for
example.
and
the
fact
that
this
is
itself
can
be
gleaned
from
the
court
--
by
the
court
--
by
reading
of
the
record
at
page
241,
in
which
on
the
--
when
the
petitioner
came
back
to
the
committee
on
the
second
time,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
need
be
with
the
--
it
begins
on
about
--
at
page
239,
but
looking
at
the
middle
of
page
241,
he
was
asked
to
disclose
whether
or
not
reverend
edward
graham
was
a
member
of
the
naacp.
mr.
holt
said
that
reverend
graham
that
--
what's
--
the
pertinence
of
the
question
is
that
reverend
graham
is
and
has
been
a
member
of
the
organization
in
dade
county
that
over
a
period
of
years,
he
is
or
has
been
a
member
of
certain
organizations
which
have
been
listed
as
subversive,
etcetera.
now,
we
contend
that
the
committee
was
not
really
looking
for
these
persons.
that
what
the
committee
was
in
fact
doing
and
what
is
before
this
court,
is
not
a
discussion
of
an
abstract
principle
of
state
power
but
the
same
issue
which
was
before
this
court
in
naacp
versus
alabama
and
the
bates
case
and
in
the
case
from
louisiana.
and
that
is
that,
and
i
have
not
stressed
this
in
the
argument
in
this
case
because
this
case
does
not
come
here
of
a
--
as
a
case
of
first
impression,
but
this
court
as
i
understood
its
opinion
in
both
cases
held
that
this
being
an
organization
of
a
minority
group,
unpopular,
that
the
freedom
of
persons
or
their
desire
to
the
persons
who
might
ordinarily
join
would
be
deterred
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
might
be
disclosed
and
--
their
names
might
be
disclosed,
their
identity
might
be
disclosed,
and
therefore,
they
would
be
subjected
to
kinds
of
intimidations,
intimidation
which
would
prevent
their
doing
what
the
constitution
says
that
they
can
do
and
that
is
to
participate
in
a
lawful
group
activity.
for
this
reason,
in
that
case,
this
court
said
that
there
must
be
a
status
with
some
compelling
--
of
compelling
proportions
in
order
for
the
intrusion
in
this
area
to
be
allowed,
and
secondly,
that
the
disclosure
must
be
relevant
to
a
valid
legislative
objective.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
i
don't
have
--
i
don't
think
i
have
to
make
that
argument,
but
i
do
think
that
what
the
state
must
disclose,
is
not
only
that
the
interest
and
that
is
the
interest
here
being
investigation
of
subversion,
but
that
the
state's
interest
must
be
directed
one
to
a
valid
legislative
objective
and
it
must
show
that
there
is
some
basis
for
the
inquiry
in
this
particular
instance.
in
other
words,
this
is
not
a
case
as
it
was
in
--
but
baron,
black
or
braden
or
wilkinson
in
which
the
petitioner
was
asked,
"are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?"
nor
is
this
the
case
in
which
the
--
if
there
is
an
assertion
by
the
investigators
that
the
organization
is
subversive
nor
is
it
a
case
in
which
there
is
an
--
any
assertion
at
all
that
the
organization
engaged
in
any
illegal
or
unconstitutional
activities,
nor
as
in
wilkinson
and
braden
had
there
been
any
showing
that
the
inquiry
is
directed
to
any
legislative
objective
that
there
is
any
legislation
being
composed
which
would
deal
with
this
particular
problem,
i
must
say
that
i
don't
know
what
this
--
what
they
could
do
in
this
instance
validly
legislated.
what
this
is
and
re
--
we
think
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
if
the
state
were
really
interested
in
information,
then
of
course
it
could
do
this
in
another
way,
but
what
i
was
attempting
to
define
was
that
the
limits
what
i
regard
as
state
power.
and
in
this
instance,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
has
to
make
this
kind
of
showing
or
else,
what
is
really
occurring
is
that
the
state
can
say,
“we
are
concerned
with
the
infiltration
of
communists.
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
they're
members
of
subversive
organizations,
of
subversive
groups
and
a
particular
organization,
and
it
that
regard
it
can
destroy
the
enclosure
which
this
court
has
erected
around
freedom
of
association
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
and
i
think
that
this
court,
that
this
is
a
retreat
them
from
that
decision
which
i
would
respectfully
urge
that
this
court
not
take.
now,
in
further
answer
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
inquiry,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
if
the
--
if
there
was
any
real
interest
here
in
evidencing
to
the
petitioner's
organization
that
we
have
the
information
that
these
13
people
are
members
of
the
party,
they're
likely
to
taint
your
organization,
you
be
careful
about
them
that
what
they
can
do
is
to
inform.
they
could
inform
the
petitioner's
organization
to
watch
out
for
these
persons
and
permit
them
if
they
--
if
such
people
are
in
the
organization
to
purge
them
from
it.
but
if
they
did
not
do
that,
what
they
did
was
to
attempt
to
--
by
this
means,
we
think
to
get
constructive
possession
of
the
membership
list.
and
we
say
if
the
court
please,
that
this
case
is
of
the
same
of
a
piece
with
the
same
situation
which
was
before
this
court
from
alabama,
louisiana
and
arkansas
that
if
the
court
will
read
the
first
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
this
case.
but
the
supreme
court
of
florida
took
this
court's
opinion
in
naacp
versus
alabama
and
said,
that
the
committee
at
that
time
was
seeking
the
possession
of
the
entire
membership
list.
but
the
court
said,
in
view
of
naacp
versus
alabama,
we
do
not
hold
that
you
can
have
that
but
that
--
on
the
grounds
that
you're
looking
for
a
communist
in
the
organization,
you
may
require
an
answer
to
this
--
to
specific
questions
asked
by
--
as
to
whether
a
person
--
validating
as
to
whether
a
person
belongs
to
this
organization.
and
we
if
the
court
please,
that
this
is
a
legalism,
that
what
this
does
by
not
placing
any
real
predicate,
any
real
indication
by
the
court,
any
real
showing
by
the
committee
that
there
is
some
link,
some
real
link
between
the
organization
and
communism
that
what
is
in
--
it
in
fact
saying
is
that
we,
merely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
we
alleged
that
certain
--
a
person
is
a
communist,
then
we
can
get
your
--
just
your
membership
was
entirely.
and
we
think
that
this
gives
the
individual
whose
custodian
of
the
listing,
the
only
person
who
can
protect
the
membership
list
and
the
freedom
for
association
of
the
organization's
members.
in
this
instance,
gives
him
no
principles
on
which
to
stand,
he
acts
--
he
doesn't
know
what
names
to
give
up,
he
has
to
give
up
all
the
names
or
else
he
has
no
way
of
knowing
whether
these
persons
who
are
called
communists
are
in
fact
communists
or
not.
and
i
might
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
i
would
--
again,
i
don't
think
i
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
i
think
that
if
there
was
a
showing,
not
that
do
we
have
evidence
that
a,
b
and
c
are
members
of
the
communist
party,
but
a
real
showing
of
a
connection,
an
activity
on
the
part
of
the
organization
which
connects
it,
which
--
that
which
--
has
--
give
up
the
--
the
state
reason
to
believe
that
is
harboring
subversives
and
engaging
in
subversive
activity,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
would
present
to
the
court
an
entirely
different
question.
and
that
would
present
also
to
the
court
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
individuals
who
was
custodian
of
the
list
had
a
reason
to
know
and
believe
and
understand
that
this
is
exactly
what
the
organization
is
doing.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
but,
i
think
that
what
i
was
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
alright.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
but
the
--
exactly,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
i
would
add
the
other
point
that
i
think
that
this
court
held
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
and
that
is
not
only
the
factual
evidence
of
subversive
activities
must
be
demonstrated,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
must
also
be
able
to
show
that
the
disclosure
which
it
seeks
is
relevant
to
a
valid
legislative
objective.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
is
set
in
two
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
alright.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
alright.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
black,
that
there
is
any
difference
in
my
answer
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
mr.
justice
brennan
and
to
your
question.
i
think
what
i
--
what
i
understood
--
mr.
justice
brennan
to
indicate
was
that,
that
this
showing
of
the
link
of
communist
activity
would
be
the
evidence
which
this
court
would
weigh
as
to
whether
this
was
an
overriding
--
overriding
the
state
interest.
and
of
course,
in
terms
of
weighing
it,
the
court
would
have
to
decide,
must
decide
what
--
whether
this
is
sufficient.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
--
and
that's
--
that's
exactly
the
point
which
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
we've
been
trying
to
make
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
the
naacp's
resolution
in
respect
to
the
presence
of
communist
in
its
ranks
is
a
relevant
fact.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
it
--
in
1950
adopted
the
--
this
kind
of
resolution.
it
evidenced
that
there
was
a
problem
and
i
think
that
when
the
courts
reached
the
other
resolutions
that
have
been
adopted
from
year
to
year
is
there's
an
indication
that
this
problem
had
been
dealt
with
by
the
organization
itself.
i
also
think
that
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir,
but
i
think
that
these
--
that
having
--
taken
these
steps
does
not
give
the
state
the
right
to
say
that
this
is
evidence
of
activity
which
links
you
clearly
upon
on
that
factor
alone
to
subversion,
into
subversive
activities.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
it
has
about
1500
chapters.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
didn't
understand
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
as
to
mean
that.
i
understood
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
to
raise
the
--
raise
with
me
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
fact
that
the
naacp
had
enacted
a
resolution
of
this
kind,
was
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
a
--
in
the
determination
of
this
court
--
of
this
question.
and
i
believe
that
the
--
quite
frankly,
that
the
--
the
resolution
does
show
that
the
organization
had
a
problem
but
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
--
what
i
wanted
to
say
in
further
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
is
that
this
record
shows
that
insofar
as
these
persons
are
concerned,
and
so
far
as
the
persons
in
miami
who
are
in-charge
of
keeping
the
org
--
keeping
this
resolution
being
sure
that
there
was
no
communist
infiltration
but
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
of
testimony,
these
persons
that
over
ten
years
that
they
had
never
heard
of
any
communist
activity
in
the
organization.
they
are
charged
with
pro
--
with
the
thing
that
this
resolution
is
enforced
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
refute
this.
so,
that
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
that
the
record
from
the
basis
of
the
resolution
makes
clear
and
it's
undisputed
that
the
resolution
has
been
enforced
that
in
regard
to
the
miami
chapter
and
that
there
is
no
communist
activities
certainly
the
state.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
i
did
not
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
did
--
i
didn't
say
that.
i
don't
intend
to
say
that,
but
i
do
think
that
even
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there's
such
a
resolution
that
the
state
is
obligated
to
present
concrete
evidence
showing
an
activity
or
some
thing
set
that
the
organization
itself
in
miami
is
harboring
subversion.
and
i
think
the
state
has
failed
to
do
this
before
it
can
show
to
this
court
that
it
has
presented
some
substantial
inference
which
subordinates,
the
right
of
freedom
for
association
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
if
i
may
say
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
the
state
cannot
merely
be
investigating
something
for
the
purpose
of
investigating.
it
must
be
related
to
something.
it
has
to
--
if
they
are
investigating
the
presence
of
communist
in
the
miami
branch
of
the
naacp,
it
has
to
be
related,
i
think.
and
i
think
this
court
held
to
this
in
the
watkins
versus
united
states,
something
in
regard
to
the
congressional
investigation,
it
has
to
be
related
to
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
i
also
think
that
this
court
reaffirmed
this
doctrine
in
braden
and
in
wilkinson.
and
i
don't
believe
that
it's
sufficient
to
say
that
they
are
investigating
the
presence
of
communist
or
that
they
have
a
right
to
investigative.
of
course,
i
think
they
have
a
right
to
investigate
but
it
has
to
be
related
to
something
that
they
can
do,
some
valid
purpose
which
i
think
that
they
have
failed
to
show
in
this
particular
case.
and
i
--
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
this
committee
has
to
--
in
existence
since
1956,
that
it
has
been
reconstituted
in
1957
and
1959
and
in
1961.
and
as
--
and
it
--
during
all
this
period
of
time,
it
has
not
evidenced
and
certainly
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
evidence
that
it
is
doing
anything
valid
--
in
a
valid
legislative
objective
in
terms
of
this
other
than
an
attempt
to
disclose
and
expose
which
i
think
this
court
says
that
legislative
power
cannot
be
used
to
that
extent.
for
these
reasons,
if
the
court
please,
we
respectfully
urge
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
court
please
–-
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
unless
the
court
wants
to
ask
me
some
questions,
i
--
