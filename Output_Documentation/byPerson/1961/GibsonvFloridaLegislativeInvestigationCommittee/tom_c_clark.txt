justice
tom
c.
clark
do
i
understand
that
he
refused
to
say
whether
he
himself
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
they
introduced
now
the
witness
who
testified
that
the
12
named
persons
were
communists?
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
there
were
questions
directly
as
your
witness
or
--
is
whether
they
belonged
to
any
(inaudible)?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
wonder
if
the
committee
has
given
this
(inaudible)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
if
we
--
unless
the
court
finds
(inaudible)
that
you're
right,
would
you
recommend
the
committee
(inaudible)
the

some
action
alleviating

conviction
if
the
reverend
answered
the
questions?
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
a
testimony
that
[inaudible]
instructed
by
the
communist
party
to
infiltrate

justice
tom
c.
clark

trying
to
find
out,

it
the
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
numbers
in
[inaudible]
the
names,
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
all
the
names
could
show,
it
would
be
that
john
doe
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
that
john
doe
is
a
member
of
naacp
[inaudible]
which
proves
that
nexus.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
then
the
legislature
might
--
if
it's
sufficiently
extensive
as
you
said,
might
not
do
