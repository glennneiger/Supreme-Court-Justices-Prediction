where
--
where
do
i
find
that,
mr.
carter?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
big
--
how
large
is
the
membership
of
the
naacp
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
at
that
adapted
party?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
committee
functus
officio
now
or
is
it
still
operates?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
fair
to
say
that
we
should
take
this
record
as
if
the
committee
had
expressly
said,
“we
do
not
claim
that
the
naacp
is
a
communist
organization
itself
or
even
a
front
organization,
but
we
are
interested
in
knowing
to
what
extent
communists
have
infiltrated
the
organization
and
made
use
of
the
naacp,
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
carter,
i
think
at
the
last
argument
you
said
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
you
made
no
claim
in
this
case
that
this
was
not
a
bona
fide
investigation
in
the
sense
that
the
truth
just
an
effort
to
smear
the
naacp,
you
said
you
made
no
claim
at
that
time?
am
i
wrong?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
correct?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
question
--
that's
reason
i
asked
you
the
question
because
i
have
a
--
i
was
impressed
with
your
frankness
of
that
--
saying
what
you
did
last
time
in
a
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
was
wondering
whether
i
had
either
misunderstood
you
or
whether
you
had
a
different
view
with
the
matter
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
that
--
that's
not
your
position
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
could
be
done
without
any
exhibition
of
the
list
to
the
committee
or
the
group
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
florida
supreme
court
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
reverend
gibson
have
had
a
very
good
memory
and
he
did
as
you
said
he
was
willing
to
do
and
testify
as
to
those
names
you
could
recollect,
how
does
the
impact
on
the
naacp
differ
from
that
which
would
result
from
his
oral
testimony
as
against
that
which
would
result
from
his
request
testimony?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
claim
in
this
case
that
the
state
had
no
power
to
contest
this
investigation
no
const
--
(inaudible)
--
it
was
a
constitutionally
unauthorized
investigation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
assume
that
there
was
a
sufficient
nexus
so
called
--
do
you
understand
what
i
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
sufficient
justification
for
the
committee
to
proceed
to
make
an
investigation
of
this
character,
do
you
still
say
that
the
records
for
the
limited
purpose
for
which
they
were
questioned
could
not
be
required?
justice
john
m.
harlan
–
in
determining
whether
was
a
link,
do
you
think
that
the
naacp's
resolution
with
respect
to
communist
infiltration
in
its
ranks
is
a
relevant
factor
to
take
into
consideration?
justice
john
m.
harlan
nobody
is
suggesting
that
the
naacp
is
not
taking
steps
to
defend
itself
against
this
sort
of
thing,
that's
the
very
purpose
of
the
resolution,
it
shows
on
its
face.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
put
you
again
the
question,
granting
all
that,
you
say
that
that
insulates
the
organization
from
official
inquiry?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
you
did.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
mr.
carter,
the
very
purpose
of
an
investigation
is
to
ascertain
whether
something
is
so
or
not
so
and
you
are
surely
not
suggesting
that
as
a
predicate
for
making
such
an
inquiry
is
the
state
might
show
that
in
fact
what
it's
undertaken
to
investigate
exists
before
it
can
begin
the
inquiry
in
to
it.
