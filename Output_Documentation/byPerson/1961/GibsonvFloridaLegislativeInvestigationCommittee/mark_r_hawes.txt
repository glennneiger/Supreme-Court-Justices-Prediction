mr.
mark
r.
hawes
if
your
honors
please.
i
hope
you
will
indulge
my
rough
voice.
i
am
just
overcoming
a
severe
sinus
attack.
i'll
try
to
stand
in
form
of
the
facts
with
one
opinion.
if
i
--
opinion
is
too
much
please,
indicate
it
out
(inaudible).
if
i
may
at
the
outset
begin
my
back
--
my
argument
back
with
your
honors,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
hugo
black's
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
could've
called
the
alleged
subversives,
i
would
like
to
direct,
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
did
call
some
of
the
alleged
subversives
in
this
case
and
before
we
called
the
petitioner
gibson,
we
called
a
communist
party
member
abe
sorokin
to
the
witness
stand.
this
appears,
beginning
at
the
record
on
page
22,
you
will
find
--
beginning
actually
on
19
of
the
record.
i
call
mr.
sorkin
to
the
stand
and
mr.
sorokin
declined
to
answer
any
question
i
asked
him
asserting
his
absolute
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment.
among
the
questions
i
asked
mr.
sorokin
and
this
was
before
we
called
petitioner
gibson
was,
“mr.
sorokin,
are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
united
states?”
he
declined
to
answer
that
on
the
ground
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
other
constitutional
privilege.
i
asked
him
if
he
--
“have
you
now
--
have
you
indeed
in
the
county
of
florida
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states?”
that
question
he
declined
on
the
same
ground.
i
asked
him,
“are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
naacp
in
miami-dade
county,
florida?”
i
asked
him,
“is
it
true
that
you
are
--
that
you
were
in
fact
a
member
of
the
naacp
and
that
you
joined
it
at
the
direction
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states?”
that
question
mr.
sorokin
declined
to
answer
on
the
grounds
among
other
than
his
fifth
amendment
rights
which
gave
him
an
absolute
privilege
on
all
of
the
decisions
of
our
own
courts.
now
then
your
honor,
my
committee
investigator
testified
point
blank
that
mr.
sorikin
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
gave
his
communist
party
card
number.
mr.
sorikin
is
one
of
the
men
about
whom
we
asked
the
petitioner.
of
course,
we
have
received
the
same
response
to
every
communist
party
member
that
we
have
called
used
the
fifth
amendment.
we
called
in
this
particular
hearing
other
party
members.
i
think
you'll
find
benny
--
a
witness
named
benny
stellar
was
called
in
this
case
and
asked
him,
we
got
the
same
result.
so,
actually
we
tried
to
pursue
the
notion
of
getting
this
information
from
the
witnesses
themselves
or
the
subversives
themselves
and
we
ran
into
a
blank
wall.
if
i
may
say
your
honors,
the
only
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
on
--
and
clearly
that
del
--
delineated
on
page
17
of
the
petitioner's
writ
for
certiorari
and
the
first
two
sentences
of
the
paragraph
beginning
just
above
the
middle
of
that
page.
and
this
is
the
issue
which
is
stated
by
the
petitioner
and
which
i
accept
as
a
true
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
page
17
of
the
petition
for
writ,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
the
issue
is
not
whether
petitioner
is
compelled
to
disclose
the
entire
membership
list
of
the
naacp
or
even
on
the
names
of
some
members.
the
issue
is
whether
petitioner
can
be
compelled
to
produce
his
organization's
membership
list
to
testify
concerning
any
persons,
association
or
status
and
i
--
in
the
line
there,
if
your
honors
please,
under
any
conceivable
conditions
ever.
what
you're
being
asked
to
do
in
this
case
is
precisely
what
you
were
asked
to
do
in
the
barenblatt
case
and
what
you
failed
to
do
in
that
case
is
to
erect
a
constitutional
sanctuary
of
absolute
immunity
around
people
engaged
in
a
particular
activity
or
belonging
to
a
certain
class
or
association.
in
the
barenblatt
case,
your
honor,
will
ask
a
whole
that
a
person
belonging
to
the
educational
field
cannot
be
interrogated
about
communist
activities
on
the
ground,
of
course,
of
--
not
only
first
amendment
freedom
of
associational
rights
but
i
think
freedom,
academic
freedom.
now,
if
you
will
turn
to
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
the
appendix
of
the
petitioner's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
at
page
28,
i
may
say
to
you
your
honors
that
mr.
justice
thornal
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
one
of
the
brainiest
constitutional
lawyers
i
have
ever
encountered
in
my
experience
as
a
lawyer.
mr.
justice
thornal
held
in
these
two
opinions
which
are
attached
to
this
appendix
that
we
could
not
compel
the
other
witness
graeme
to
testify
about
the
membership
of
these
same
people
in
the
naacp
because
we
had
the
petitioner,
the
custodian
of
the
records
there
that
purpose.
and
mr.
justice
thornal
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
exonerated
the
appellant
graeme
from
a
contempt
conviction.
he
declined
to
answer
any
questions
on
the
grounds
that
we
had
the
custodian
of
the
records
here
who
could
give
us
this
information,
gibson
in
this
case.
now
if
you
will
look
at
mr.
justice
thornal's
opinion,
you
will
find,
beginning
on
page
25
and
he
says
that
if
the
factual
situation
were
analogous,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
naacp
versus
alabama,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
would
of
course
honor
your
honors'
decision
in
that
case
and
reversed
the
conviction
of
this
man,
but
he
finds
the
facts
are
markedly
different
as
they
are.
on
page
27
of
the
appendix,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
he
finds
that
as
in
the
uphaus
case,
this
record
unequivocally
reports
that
members
of
the
communist
party
and
members
of
the
affiliates
--
of
its
affiliates
have
on
various
occasions
attended
meetings
or
participated
in
the
affairs
of
the
naacp
in
miami.
that
appears
in
this
record
as
judge
thornal
says
it
does.
on
the
top
of
page
28
of
the
appendix
on
his
opinion,
he
finds
that
what
the
appellant
is
really
asking
is
that
they
construct
a
constitutional
city
of
refuge
which
opens
its
precincts
to
those
who
seek
to
speak
freely
and
assemble
righteously
in
their
advocacy
of
their
just
causes.
and
in
doing
so
however,
he
would
have
us
provide
ideological
asylum
for
those
who
would
destroy
by
a
violence
the
very
foundation
upon
which
their
governmental
sanctuary
stands.
an
appeal
so
ideological
he
thinks
cannot
make
judicial
sanctuary
and
if
your
honors
please,
they
have
no
dispute
between
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
myself
as
to
the
law
of
this
case.
this
is
purely
and
simply
a
question
of
fact.
if
there
is
any
evidence
in
this
record
sufficient
to
show
probable
cause
to
believe
that
subversive
persons
have
been
associated
with
the
naacp
in
dade
county,
florida
then
this
case
falls
under
the
rational
of
your
honors'
decisions
in
barenblatt,
wilkinson,
braden
and
uphaus
and
the
petitioner's
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
if
you
find
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
that
we
have
any
communist
in
dade
county
who
have
been
or
may
have
been
participating
in
the
naacp's
meetings
and
decisions
down
there,
if
you
find
that
as
purely
a
figment
of
the
imagination
of
the
committee
from
the
record
then
of
course
you
should
reverse
the
conviction
of
the
appellant
of
the
petitioner
and
set
him
free.
in
that
connection,
we
all
know
and
we
have
discussed
in
today
that
some
51
people
altogether
were
identified
in
this
record.
i
want
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
one
other
piece
of
evidence
in
this
case
which
in
most
material
to
the
consideration
of
the
nexus
between
subversive
activities
in
the
naacp
or
as
counsel
referred
to
in
a
moment
ago
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
black,
the
connecting
link.
if
you
will
look
on
pages
119
and
120
of
the
record,
you
will
find
the
piece
of
evidence
there
which
in
my
judgment
is
absolutely
sufficient
to
justify
the
investigation
which
the
committee
undertook
and
which
the
courts
of
florida
have
upheld.
here's
an
anti-communism
resolution
brought
by
the
petitioner
himself
to
the
committee's
hearing
and
of
course
which
we've
already
possessed
up
when
we
started
this
hearing.
if
you
will
look
at
pages
16
and
17
of
my
brief,
i
quote
that
resolution
there
and
i
have
italicized
for
the
court's
convenience
certain
portions
of
that
resolution.
i
set
this
resolution
out
setting
--
starting
on
page
16
of
my
brief.
and
this
is
a
resolution
which
by
the
petitioner
it
is
admitted
was
passed
by
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
no
later
than
its
last
national
convention
last
year.
and
it
says
starting
out
where
certain
branches
of
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
are
being
wrecked
by
internal
conflicts
between
groups
who
follow
the
communist
line
and
those
who
do
not
and
going
on
in
that
paragraph
to
say
that
that
thing
asserts
that
it's
threatening
to
disrupt
the
organization.
in
the
next
paragraph,
and
whereas
it
is
apparent
from
numerous
attacks
by
communist
in
their
official
argument,
the
daily
workman,
the
political
affairs
that
there
is
a
well-organized
nationwide
conspiracy
by
communists
either
to
capture
or
split
and
wreck
the
naacp
and
incidentally
we
have
shown
this
by
independent
evidence
in
other
hearings,
they
recognize
that
it
is
a
name
of
the
n.a.a.c.
--
of
the
communist
party
to
penetrate
and
capture
their
organization.
and
they
resolved
in
the
next
paragraph
your
honor
that
they
go
on
the
record
as
against
the
communist
and
here,
we
have
called
upon
and
direct
and
instruct
the
national
board
of
the
directors
to
appoint
a
committee
to
investigate
and
study
the
ideological
composition
in
terms
of
the
membership
and
leadership
of
the
local
units
with
the
view
to
determining
the
causes
of
these
things
and
then
they
instruct
and
resolve
that
that
board
shall
have
a
necessary
authority
to
investigate
such
infiltration
and
if
necessary
suspend,
reorganize
and
ban
a
local
branch
of
the
naacp
that's
been
infiltrated.
in
other
words,
the
national
convention
and
solemn
convention
assumed
has
found
that
some
of
their
branches
are
so
infiltrated
that
they
themselves
had
set
up
an
investigating
committee
to
cope
with
the
situation,
and
if
that
is
true
your
honors
and
that
evidence
comes
from
the
petitioner
himself,
“why
wouldn't
the
state
of
florida
show
that
there's
at
least
50
some
odd
communist
in
dade
county
in
close
proximity
to
the
miami
branch
down
there?
why
can
the
state
of
florida
not
determine
whether
or
not
that
situation
exist
in
the
miami
branch
so
that
we
may
determine
whether
or
not
it's
necessary
that
we
legislate
in
whatever
area
your
honors
have
left
to
us
to
control,
sedition
directed
against
the
state
of
florida
and
against
seditions
directed
against
the
united
states
government
under
the
nelson
decision.
that
is
purely
and
simply,
your
honors,
a
question
of
fact.
the
record
abounds
and
i
say
supports
clearly
the
state's
position
in
this
case.
the
record
sets
the
uphaus
decision
in
motion,
the
barenblatt
decision,
the
wilkinson
decision
and
the
braden
decision
in
motion
in
this
case.
your
honors,
we
were
not
pursuing
reverend
gibson
in
this
case.
if
you
will
look
at
this
record,
you
will
see
i
gave
him
at
least
three
or
four
opportunities
to
purge
himself
to
comply
with
our
request
in
this
case.
we
didn't
want
that
reverend
gibson
(inaudible)
in
this
case,
we
wanted
the
information.
this
case
has
been
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
two
occasions
before
it
ever
reached
your
honors'
doorsteps.
you
will
find
that
the
fair
conclusion
of
this
entire
hearing,
i
called
him
back
to
the
stand
after
he
had
repeatedly
refused
to
comply
with
the
order
of
the
committee
and
asked
him
again
if
he
wouldn't
comply
with
the
order
of
the
committee
after
calling
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
were
some
names
that
he
wouldn't
recognize
out
of
the
thousand
names,
that
he
didn't
know
all
the
members
of
his
branch.
he
admitted,
if
you
will
look
at
the
record
that
he
didn't
know
all
the
members
of
his
branch
and
that
he
wouldn't
associate
a
name
with
the
face
sometimes
and
yet,
he
wouldn't
comply
with
the
order
--
the
committee
or
the
court.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
will
say
this
to
your
honor.
i
don't
know
of
course
what
position
my
committee
would
take.
if
it
takes
the
same
position
it
has
always
taken,
we
have
permitted
several
witnesses
to
purge
themselves.
we
are
civilized
people
down
there
in
the
legislature
of
florida
your
honor
and
i
know
that
for
myself,
i
have
no
desire
to
see
reverend
gibson
in
jail
at
all.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
of
course,
that
case
(voice
overlap)
committee.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
the
difficulty
now
that
with
the
position
i'm
in,
your
honor,
is
the
committee
does
not
control.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
this
is
a
--
a
contempt
to
the
court
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
--
case
now.
you
see,
what
has
happened
is,
we
have
invoked
the
aid
of
the
circuit
court
and
he
has
come
in
contempt
to
the
circuit
court
of
leon
county,
florida
by
refusing
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
but,
he
has
been
ordered
twice
by
the
circuit
court
to
do
this,
your
honor
and
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
once
to
do
this
before
he
was
ever
put
under
this
final
order
of
contempt.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
but
before
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
well,
honestly,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
what
his
position
--
judge
walker
would
make
to
this
case
in
the
circuit
court.
if
the
petitioner
wanted
to
purge
himself
that
would
be
another
matter.
i
could
not
speak
for
the
circuit
court,
but
i
know
this.
i
know
that
the
record
shows
that
we
have
sought
information
from
this
man
in
this
case
and
i
know
this
was
the
fact
that
this
particular
witness
was
not
the
official
custodian
of
the
records
in
this
case
until
it
was
announced
that
we
were
going
to
hold
this
hearing
and
i
know
that
the
reverend
gibson
took
it
on
his
self
to
take
the
records
from
the
official
custodian
who
was
the
secretary
of
the
miami
branch
and
he
announced
publicly
that
he
had
the
records
that
he
wouldn't
produce
them.
and
he
defied
this
committee
in
advance
of
the
hearing
being
called
and
he
came
there
with
that
attitude
of
defiance
and
he's
stuck
to
it
through
out
the
hearing
and
through
out
all
the
court
proceeding.
and
this
record
will
show
that
the
witness
burnell
alberry
was
the
real
custodian
of
this
record
before
reverend
gibson
took
him
over
as
president
and
he
actively
asserted
himself
into
the
position
that
he
now
finds
himself,
your
honor.
he
hasn't
given
us
any
choice
in
this
case,
but
on
the
question
of
law
which
is
all
before
the
court,
i
submit
that
it's
a
purely
a
fact
of
question
and
it
directly
brings
us
within
the
braden,
uphaus
and
barenblatt's
cases
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
it
is
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
would
on
this
condition,
your
honor.
and
one
thing
that
counsel
and
i
have
always
been
at
fundamental
dagger
heads
for
in
this
case.
you
understand
we
are
trying
to
hold
an
investigation
and
when
we
asked
him
about
a
particular
person,
we'd
tell
him,
“we
are
interested
in
this
particular
fellow's
affiliation.”
now,
counsel
has
taken
the
position
that
they
have
got
the
right
to
make
us
prove
to
the
witnesses'
satisfaction
that
the
information
we
have
about
the
subversive
affiliation
to
the
man
we
are
asking
him
about
is
right
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt.
now,
of
course,
your
honor,
no
investigation
can
be
conducted
if
every
time
you
want
to
ask
a
witness
about
the
association
of
a
particular
third
party,
you've
got
to
stop
from
having
a
side
trial
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
third
party
is
really
a
subversive.
now,
if
he
will
answer
the
question
about
the
people
which
our
committee's
information
indicate
are
subversives
or
affiliated
with
subversive
activities
in
florida
and
in
his
branch,
i
personally
will
recommend
to
my
committee
that
they
recommend
to
the
court
that
these
sentence
not
be
executed
or
at
least
shortened,
yes
sir.
i
have
no
desire
to
see
this
man
in
jail
and
if
you
will
read
in
the
record,
you
will
see
the
last
thing
i
did
with
him
was
to
give
him
another
opportunity
to
answer
these
questions.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
there
is,
mr.
justice
black
but
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no,
sir.
but
its
validity
at
this
time
is
in
a
(inaudible)
condition
since
your
honors
decision
in
nelson
versus
--
versus
pennsylvania.
we
have
never
revised
that
statute
to
take
out
those
portions
of
it
directed
against
subversion
--
directed
against
the
federal
government.
the
--
the
validity
of
that
statute
is
very
much
as
presently
withdrawn
in
question.
we
have
such
a
statute
though.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no,
sir,
your
honor,
none
whatsoever?
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
if
your
honors
please,
i
was
a
little
surprised
today
to
see
my
opponent
taking
the
position
that
in
addition
to
the
nexus
between
communist
activities
or
subversion
and
people
within
this
organization
that
we
had
to
show
an
addition
before
we
could
raise
these
questions.
some
evidence
said
this
organization
as
such
was
engaging
in
some
sort
of
subversive
activity.
now
this
is
not
the
question,
if
your
honors
please,
this
case
came
before
this
court
only.
it
is
not
a
question
embraced
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
that
you
issued.
now,
if
you
refer
that
these
two
petition
for
the
writ
itself,
you
will
see
the
question
presented
is
quite
substantially
different
from
the
contentions
being
made
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
here
in
this
argument.
the
question
is
presented
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
is
whether
or
not
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
we
could
compel
these
answers
without
violating
the
freedom
of
association
and
privacy.
in
the
absence
of
some
showing
of
a
nexus
between
the
communist
party
or
communist
front
organizations
and
their
subversive
activities
in
the
petitioner's
organization,
i
deem
that
to
be
a
proper
question,
if
your
honors
please,
and
i
deem
that
to
be
the
question
that's
before
the
court
for
consideration.
and
i
say
that
if
a
nexus
is
established
by
this
record
showed
that
there's
reason
to
believe
that
people
connected
with
a
subversive
organizations
are
or
might
be
members
of
the
miami
branch
of
the
naacp
what
you
have
an
actuality
before
the
court,
is
uphaus
against
wyman
over
and
over.
now,
it
is
not
required
and
was
not
required
in
the
uphaus
case
that
the
legislative
committee
of
new
hampshire
operating
as
a
one-man
committee
through
the
attorney
general,
show
that
the
world
fellowship
organization
had
engaged
in
any
subversive
activities.
but
the
nexus
in
that
case
was
that
some
18
or
19
members
of
the
communist
party
and/or
communist
front
affiliation
groups
had
spoke
at
meetings
in
a
summer
camp
run
by
the
world
fellowship
association.
that
was
the
sole
nexus
in
that
case.
that
record
didn't
purport
to
show
that
the
world
fellowship
association
as
such
had
engaged
in
any
subversive
activities.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
your
honor
i
read
uphaus
opinion
yesterday.
if
my
recollection
is
not
in
error
and
i
admit
it
may
be,
the
only
evidence
reflected
by
that
opinion
is
that
uphaus
himself
is
--
and
he
was
executive
director
i
believe
or
secretary
of
world
fellowship
shown
to
be
a
member
one
or
more
communist-run
associated
organizations.
and
at
the
summer
camp
run
by
this
association
had
their
speakers
of
some
--
i
believe
19
speakers,
some
of
whom
had
been
members
of
the
communist
party
and
some
of
whom
had
been
members
of
various
front
organizations.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no
sir.
i
can't
glean
that
from
the
opinion
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
say
that
these
are
meetings
at
the
summer
camp
run
by
the
organization.
the
record
does
not
show
from
the
opinion
that
this
is
official
meetings
of
the
organization,
but
they
are
meetings
of
some
type
at
the
summer
camp
run
by
this
organization
in
which
these
people
spoke,
that
is
what
i
glean
from
the
opinion.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
think
not
mr.
justice
goldberg.
what
you
have
in
mind
is
a
fact
that
the
laws
of
new
hampshire
required
this
summer
camp
which
ran
apparently
a
larger
motel
to
maintain
a
guest
list
for
the
state
purposes
but
it
did
not
appear
that
this
list
had
actually
become
available
to
the
state.
it
simply
was
that
the
state
law
required
the
maintenance
of
this
list
to
show
which
guest
apparently
had
stayed
at
the
motel
or
the
hotel.
that
is
my
impression
of
the
decision.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
well
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
in
the
uphaus
case
to
answer
your
question,
the
legislative
directed
to
the
attorney
general
was
extremely
broad
and
as
i
read
your
decision,
it
was
for
him
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
were
any
communist
or
subversives
within
that
state.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
think
you
reach
your
point,
to
answer
your
question
sir,
that
a
membership
can
be
so
old
if
it
can
be
shown
to
have
been
broken
that
it
becomes
irrelevant.
now,
where
that
line
is
sir,
i
do
not
purport
to
know.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
think
not.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
we
were
here
in
1956
when
we
started
this
investigation
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
well,
it
depends
upon
the
extent.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
mr.
justice
douglas,
this
brings
us
to
the
very
question
which
i
think
has
evolved
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
the
question
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
the
question
has
become
in
my
judgment
as
its
evolved
is
whether
or
not
any
legislative
investigations
committee,
state
or
national,
shall
be
permitted
to
investigate
in
this
field
at
all.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
well,
mr.
justice
douglas,
as
i
say
there
is
a
point.
definitely,
there
must
be
a
point
where
past
membership
fails
to
be
relevant
any
further.
but
i
don't
think
that
past
membership
of
a
year
or
two
years
or
three
years,
in
the
communist
party
itself
is
necessarily
irrelevant
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
individual
is
a
subversive
still.
now,
if
he
renounced
the
membership
in
the
party
10,
15,
or
20
years
ago,
i
think
clearly
there's
no
question
that
that
becomes
irrelevant
to
any
reasonable
mind.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
want
to
say
this
to
you
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
it
has
been
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
it
has
been
said
that
this
committee
that
i
represent
is
here
to
simply
trying
to
smear
the
naacp.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
--
it
has
been
said,
now
by
counsel.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
it's
a
fact.
this
same
committee
investigated
john
kasper,
the
ku
klux
klan
and
the
seaboard
citizens
white
council
in
regard
to
their
activities
in
their
same
racial
disturbance
down
there
in
florida.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
and
i
submit
your
honor
if
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
a
ku
klux
klan
that
i
wouldn't
have
any
difficulty
in
explaining
to
the
court
the
legitimacy
of
the
state's
interest
in
this
investigation.
now,
it's
certainly
is
not
true
that
this
particular
committee
of
the
state
of
florida
is
going
out
simply
to
destroy
the
naacp
and
i
want
to
say
to
your
honors
that
the
state
of
florida
has
long
recognized
the
binding
effect
of
the
judicial
decisions
of
this
court
in
regard
to
segregation
and
desegregation.
and
that
if
you
will
read
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
you
can
come
to
the
conclusion
at
all
that
any
--
the
judiciary
of
florida
and
i
know
it's
not
the
position
of
my
committee
to
defy
and
use
of
power
of
the
state
in
this
committee
to
defy
the
edicts
of
this
court
in
regard
to
desegregation.
yet
that
is
a
suggestion
that's
made
by
counsel
up
there
for
the
petitioner.
now
this
is
the
question,
pure
and
sample
as
this.
as
you're
going
to
close
this
organization
with
absolute
immunity,
from
many
sort
of
investigation
in
regard
to
subversion
and
the
effect
is
that
you're
saying
to
all
investigating
committees,
you've
got
to
get
out
of
this
field
entirely,
not
only
in
regard
to
the
race
issue
and
regard
to
communism
but
anything
else.
now
you
must
look
at
the
effect
such
a
law
will
have
on
other
cases
in
my
judgment.
i
can
see
the
effect
of
this
type
of
decision
is
overruling
the
immunity
statutes
of
many
of
the
states
and
the
federal
government.
you're
going
to
make
on
the
first
amendment
if
you
continue
and
if
you
receive
to
what
is
asked
you,
on
an
absolute
shield
in
effect
like
the
fifth
amendment.
you're
going
to
have
witnesses
coming
before
state
juries
and
regular
state
prosecutions
of
ordinary
crimes
and
saying
this
and
regardless
of
the
fact
that
i
get
immunity
under
your
law
for
my
criminal
involvement
whether
defendant
in
this
case,
i'm
not
going
to
testify
as
a
witness
from
the
state
against
this
defendant
because
it
invades
my
privacy,
my
associational
rights.
you
cannot
compel
me
to
say,
"well,
i
know
this
criminal"
and
whether
i
have
associated
with
him
before.
now,
these
are
facts
and
problems
if
your
honor
pleases,
been
said
many
times
that
hardship
law
is
bad
law.
and
when
you
sit
down
to
write
a
decision
to
protect
the
individual
because
perhaps
you
think
in
one
sympathetic
case
is
in
a
hardship
situation,
the
result
nearly
always
is
that
there's
a
distortion
of
the
true
law
that
operates
in
benefit
of
those
--
that
you
don't
contemplate.
now,
what
is
the
purpose
of
an
investigation?
what
it
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
have
never
in
my
life
and
i
have
been
--
conducted
all
of
these
investigations.
i've
never
asked
a
witness
about
his
religious
affiliations.
my
answer
to
that
is
no
sir.
but
on
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
if
the
white
citizens
council
ever
gets
itself
clearly
in
the
position
of
the
communist
party
where
it
has
been
judicially
determined
and
congressionally
determined
to
be
aimed
at
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
various
states
of
this
union,
my
answer
to
that
is
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
--
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
but
now
what
is
--
here's
the
whole
question
in
this
case
mr.
justice
o'
douglas
as
i
see
it.
are
you
going
to
require
an
investigating
committee
to
show
conclusively
before
it
can
put
questions
to
a
witness
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
thing
is
true,
that
it
is
true?
we've
got
to
make
a
conclusive
showing
that
present
members
of
the
communist
party
or
in
the
naacp
branch
in
miami
before
we
can
subject
this
organization
to
these
questions.
now
these
are
the
sole
question
in
this
case
in
my
judgment.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
because
if
we
don't
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that
is
the
question
that
has
evolved
here
orally
if
your
honor
please,
i
agree
with
that.
i
disagree
violently
that
that
is
the
question
legally
before
the
court.
[attempt
to
laughter]
now,
here's
the
situation.
we
set
out
in
here
before
these
groups,
we
call
the
counsel
in,
we
call
them
in
and
in
their
presence,
we
put
on
--
and
let
me
say
incidentally,
that
reverend
gibson
broke
into
this
hearing.
this
committee
didn't
go
looking
for
him.
this
record
shows
that
he
broke
into
this
hearing.
he
was
not
the
proper
custodian
of
these
records
at
all.
a
woman
named
ruth
perry
was
the
secretary
and
had
these
records.
he
went
and
is
present
and
took
him
and
announced
to
us
in
advance
to
that
hearing
that
he
wouldn't
produce
them
for
any
purpose
at
all
under
any
condition,
under
any
showing.
now,
when
we
called
him
up
there,
we
made
our
position
clear
by
the
same
token,
he
made
his
clear.
if
you
think
i've
exaggerated
his
position,
you
look
at
page
44
and
45
of
the
record.
on
page
44,
and
let
me
say,
there's
been
some
talk
of
14
members
of
the
communist
party
here.
mr.
strickland
did
identify
14
people
as
members
of
the
communist
party
and
those
14
people.
he
said,
he
had
reason
to
believe,
might
have
been
members
of
the
naacp
or
had
attended
meetings
of
it,
but
there
were
another
33
people
that
he
identified
as
members
of
the
party
or
communist
front
associations,
and
another
five
members
of
the
communist
party
itself
which
he
had
no
information
in
regard
to
whether
they
had
been
associated
with
the
naacp
in
any
capacity.
if
you
look
at
the
last
question
on
page
44,
i
say
to
the
reverend
gibson
that
i
have
this
list
of
people
before
me
that
they
have
been
--
according
to
my
information
affiliated
with
the
party
or
various
front
organizations
at
sometimes
--
and
i
want
to
know
whether
or
not
--
i
didn't
have
any
photographs
of
these
men,
the
first
14
men
i'd
showed
in
photographs
of
and
was
--
got
to
rely
in
on
his
memory
of
the
faces,
he
admitted
that
sometimes
you
don't
associate
name
with
the
face
and
sometimes
you
don't
recall
a
name.
i
didn't
have
any
photographs
of
any,
but
the
first
14
men,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
now
these
other
33
plus
eight
--
five,
these
38
people,
i
had
no
pictures
of
them
and
i
asked
him
if
he
would
bring
his
list
after
the
purpose
of
me
inquiring
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
they
were
members
of
naacp.
this
he
declined
to
do
and
if
you
look
on
page
45,
i
asked
this
question.
reverend,
so
there
won't
be
any
misunderstanding
on
your
position,
regardless
of
the
names
or
the
information
that
i
have
concerning
the
names
of
the
people
that
i
have
before
me
here,
you
simply
will
not
bring
your
records
here
for
the
purpose
of
comparison.
you
yourself
examining
them,
he
said,
“no
sir,
i
wouldn't.
if
you
will
call
those
names,
i
will
unequivocally
and
truthfully
tell
you
if
i
know
these
people.
question
-
based
strictly
on
the
name.
answer:
yes
sir.
question:
your
recollection
of
the
name?
question:
but
you
will
not
bring
your
records
for
the
purpose
of
comparing
your
membership
rule
with
the
list
of
the
names
that
i
have.
he
says,
"no,
no."
now,
if
your
honors
please,
they
didn't
raise
any
question
then
and
that
was
the
time
to
do
it,
that
we
haven't
--
we
hadn't
produced
enough
evidence
in
their
presence,
that
these
people
were
subversives.
that's
the
time
they
should
have
done
it
if
they
wanted
to
raise
that
question.
he
says,
my
position
is,
i'm
not
going
to
bring
those
records
into
this
hearing
room
on
any
condition
for
any
purpose,
purely
and
separate.
now,
if
his
conviction
is
to
be
set
aside
under
this
condition,
if
your
honors
please,
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
actually
presented
in
the
presence
of
he
and
his
counsel
is
not
sufficient
to
show
a
nexus,
you
are
simply
saying
that
an
investigation,
you
can't
have
one
because
you've
got
to
have
conclusive
proof
in
order
to
justify
the
inquiry
and
if
you
have
conclusive
proof
sir,
there
is
no
objective
to
the
hearing.
and
so,
you
are
simply
saying
that
you
just
can't
operate
in
this
field,
if
this
conviction
is
to
be
upset
in
my
judgment
and
that
conclusion
is
absolutely
inescapable
in
my
mind
as
a
lawyer.
as
one
way
or
the
other,
you
either
got
to
have
conclusive
proof
or
you
haven't?
now,
in
uphaus,
your
honors
made
this
comment
about
an
issue
of
the
nexus.
you
said,
the
nexus
--
the
proof
in
regard
to
the
nexus
is
“not
conclusive
but
sufficiently
relevant.”
that's
the
test
you
laid
down
in
uphaus
versus
wyman,
not
conclusive
but
sufficiently
relevant.
now,
no
court
has
ever
said
as
i
understand
the
decision,
what
degree
of
proof
must
be
laid
down
to
show
the
nexus?
i
have
never
seen
that
degree
of
proof
laid
out
in
any
decision,
but
you
talked
about
reason
to
believe
in
some
of
these
cases,
reasonable
grounds
to
think,
i
don't
think
it
means
the
same
as
probable
cause
in
a
search
warrant
case,
but
if
it
does,
the
evidence
before
the
court
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
that.
would
you
prefer
please
to
some
of
the
testimony
of
a
--
an
investigator
in
this
case
beginning
on
page
24,
down
in
the
middle
he
identified
a
woman
that
he
says
she
has
information,
this
is
record
page
24,
addressed
to
burnberg
of
miami
as
a
member
of
the
league
of
the
communist
party
and
he
gives
the
court
number
357.
he
says
he
has
all
the
information
that
she
is
a
member
of
front
organization
cited
by
the
house
un-american
activities.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
at
this
point
i
was
simply
laying
enough
evidence
out
there
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
relevancy
of
the
inquiry
to
this
witness
apparent.
think
of
the
position
the
committee
is
in.
if
i've
got
to
stop
the
inquiry
with
this
witness
to
prove
that
his
satisfaction
conclusively
that
there's
real
grounds,
in
a
factual
way
for
me
to
propound
the
questions
to
him,
i
can't
find
anything
but
irrelevant
issues
throughout
this
hearing
and
i
could
never
progress.
every
time
i
ask
him
a
question
he's
going
to
say,
“as
a
matter
of
proof,
mr.
hawes,
what
is
a
nexus,
what
is
the
relevance?”
you
see
it
and
the
investigation
cannot
progress
from
a
practical
standpoint
because
the
committee
will
be
required
to
stop
and
put
on
these
side
issues
factually
rather
than
merely
stating
to
the
witness
what
the
relevance
is.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
think,
mr.
justice
white,
that
he
is
entitled
to
some
information,
information
of
prima
facie,
taken
at
face
value,
shows
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
nexus
exists.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
in
my
judgment,
i
did.
now
that's
putting
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
well,
i
can
tell
you
of
several,
abe
sorkin.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
abe
sorkin.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
s-o-r-k-i-n.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
abe
sorkin
is
identified
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
this
record
and
he
is
identified
by
members
of
the
naacp
itself
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
as
having
attended
some
of
the
naacp
meetings.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
can
give
you
the
name
of
the
witness
who
did
that.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
don't
recall
if
reverend
gibson
knew
him.
arlington
sands
puts
abe
sorkin
in
meetings
of
naacp
on
pages
7
and
71
of
the
record.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
ruth
perry,
on
page
92
and
93
of
the
records
puts
abe
sorkin
in
meetings
of
the
naacp
and
i
believe
one
or
both
of
those
witnesses
say
they
believe
that
he
was
a
member
and
now,
members
of
the
naacp
themselves.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
abe
sorkin
was
a
witness
before
the
committee.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
he
refused
to
say
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
he
refused
to
say
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
naacp
on
the
grounds
of
the
fifth
amendment.
but
i
think
this
record
discloses
his
actual
communist
card
number,
or
one
that
he
had
borne
in
the
past.
but
in
all
events,
mr.
strickland
testified
positively
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
now,
i
note
that
among
the
14
original
men
that
i
had
pictures
of,
men
and
women,
arlington
sands
also
puts
oshana
and
james
nimmo
in
members
of
the
naacp,
oshana
and
james
nimmo
are
both
shown
to
be
communist
by
this
record,
that's
on
page
70
to
71
of
the
record.
matt
negro
is
junior
who's
co-counsel
for
the
petitioner
here
in
this
case
puts
james
nimmo
in
one
meeting
of
the
naacp
and
he
admits
he
only
attended
two
or
three
of
the
meetings
himself.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
some
are
closed
and
some
are
open,
as
i
understand
it
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
doubt
seriously
as
the
record
makes
the
distinction.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that's
one
witness,
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
there's
another
witness
who
put
sorkin
in
some
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
you'll
notice
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir
and
you'll
notice,
mr.
justice
brennan,
at
the
bottom
of
page
24
that
he
says
that
--
strickland
says,
ed
weiler,
who
recently
moved
from
miami
to
naples,
florida
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
that
he
had
--
and
advised
on
the
statement
he
had
attended
meetings
of
the
naacp
that
he'd
been
instructed
to
infiltrate.
you
look
in
the
middle
of
page
25
you
will
see
that
in
regard
to
charles
marks,
he
said
that
charles
marks
of
dade
county,
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
gives
two
numbers
that
he
has
born
there.
this
is
more
than
just
a
witness
sitting
up
there
gentlemen
only
as
counsel
and
saying
to
them,
“listen,
i
believe
out
of
the
pigment
of
my
imagination
that
this
man
might
be
a
communist
and
we
want
to
know
for
that
reason
if
he's
a
member
of
the
organization.”
now
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
mr.
justice
clark,
i'm
glad
you
brought
that
up.
i
hold
in
my
hand
what
the
document
on
file
before
you
entitled
--
appendix,
the
petitioner's
brief
on
reargument
and
if
you
will
look
on
page
7
of
that
document,
a
revolution
past
in
june
of
1956
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
this
fair
investigation,
you'll
find
this
statement
in
the
last
paragraph,
the
new
line
of
the
communist
parties
throughout
the
world
and
specially
in
the
united
states
is
by
infiltration
to
insinuate
their
programs
on
noncommunist
and
even
anti-communist
organization.
we
know,
now
this
is
the
national
--
naacp
speaking
here,
we
know
that
the
communist
leadership
in
america
has
directed
its
representatives
to
seek
--
to
involve
naacp
units
in
a
united
front
program.
this,
we
absolutely
reject
and
go
along
to
say
that
the
--
it's
necessary
now
that
they
exercise
more
precaution
than
ever.
and
in
that
connection,
if
you
gentlemen
will
please
refer
to
page
241
of
the
record,
the
page
cited
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
you
will
find
this
question
and
i
put
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case
and
i
wish
you'd
read
that
question
in
light
of
that
statement
from
naacp
there.
i
asked
about
the
membership
of
edward
t.
graham
in
the
dade
county.
i
explained
the
pertinency
of
the
question
to
the
petitioner
graham.
i
state
over
period
of
years,
graham
has
been
an
active
member
of
certain
organization,
was
listed
a
subversive
by
the
united
states
un-american
activities
committee
such
as
the
southern
conference
for
human
welfare
and
it
was
holistic,
the
southern
conference
educational
fund
which
was
also
cited
as
the
outright
communist
replacement
of
the
conference
for
human
welfare.
that
graham
has
appeared
in
addressed
meetings
of
the
soviet-american
friendship
association
and
the
fbr
club,
both
subversive
organizations.
as
recent
as,
march
12,
1960,
this
is
the
last
time
he
was
before
us.
march
12,
1960,
he
has
participated
in
meetings
in
orlando,
florida,
called
by
and
sponsored
by
this
subversive
organization
to
southern
conference
educational
fund,
that
he
went
from
miami
to
orlando
with
a
man
named
carl
braden
whose
conviction
your
honors
upheld
before
this
court,
that
there
was
present
a
man
named
james
dombrowski,
the
executive
director
of
the
southern
conference
educational
fund,
subversive
so
said
the
senate
committee
on
internal
security.
and
according
to
our
information,
dombrowski
is
a
high
official
and
member
of
a
number
of
outright
communist
organization.
i
go
on
and
on
and
i
say,
“now,
i
want
to
know
reverend
graham
--
reverend
gibson,
if
reverend
gale
is
a
member
of
your
miami
branch
and
if
he
attended
this
meeting
in
orlando
on
march
12,
1960
as
an
official
representative
of
your
organization?
am
i
not
getting
very
close
to
saying
that
what
he
contends
should
be
shown
activity
on
the
part
of
the
organization
itself?
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
in
light
of
the
statement,
we
know
that
the
communist
leadership
in
america
has
directed
its
representatives
to
seek
involvement,
to
involve
the
naacp
units
in
the
united
front
program.
this
is
the
very
united
front
program
that
they
are
referring
to
there
in
that
opinion
by
the
same
carl
braden
and
the
southern
conference
educational
fund
that
reverend
gibson
declined
to
answer
that
question.
and
i
laid
out
in
detail
the
information
that
we
have
then
in
regard
to
reverend
graham
and
his
activities
in
regard
to
this
united
front
organization.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
it
just
seems
to
me
that
you
reach
a
point
where
reason
doesn't
mean
anything.
if
you
can
say
on
this
record
if
you
read
it
carefully,
if
you'll
say
that
this
record
is
not
sufficient
to
show
that
there
is
or
maybe
a
situation
where
members
of
subversive
organizations
are
members
of
the
miami
branch
of
the
naacp
then
you've
got
to
say
this
conviction
[inaudible]
unless
you're
going
to
say
that
that
showing
has
got
to
be
conclusive.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
say,
everyone
of
them.
and
i'm
entitled
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no
sir.
mr.
justice
white,
that
is
not
my
position
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
on
everyone
of
those
33
people
that
i
wanted
to
ask
reverend
gibson
about,
he
had
no
right
to
raise
the
question
of
pertinency
and
he
hadn't
the
right
to
make
me
go
through
the
same
procedure
i
went
through
with
him
on
reverend
graham
on
page
241
and
242
and
to
tell
him
in
detail
with
what
you
want
as
referred
to
as
connective
reasoning.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
sir?
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
in
regard
to
their
connection
with
the
naacp,
i
would
not
have,
but
i
could
have
told
him
what
our
information
was
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
taken
in
context
with
this
whole
record
mr.
justice
white
if
i
had
shown
him
an
answer
to
his
question
on
pertinency,
that
we
had
evidence
to
link
them
with
the
subversive
activities,
anyone
of
them.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
and
we
place
him
in
dade
county
where
the
minor
branch
is
located.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
and
taken
in
connection
with
the
whole
testimony
of
the
others'
witnesses
and
all
the
evidence
to
show
that
it's
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
infiltration
has
been
made,
i
would
have
been
entitled
in
my
judgment
to
the
answer
regarding
that
question.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
say
if
we
show
that
there's
reason
to
believe
any
communist
infiltrated
mr.
justice
white
and
we
establish
at
any
particular
manner
subversive,
we
a
right
--
we
have
a
right
to
have
the
answers
to
whether
that
man
is
infiltrating,
that's
my
position.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
the
petitioner
in
this
case?
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
contempt
to
the
circuit
court,
of
leon
county,
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
for
refusal
to
answer
any
question
in
regard
to
--
based
in
his
testimony
on
his
membership
pledge.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
there's
no
particular
number
of
counts.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
pardon
me
mr.
justice
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
you
have
it
before
you
sir.
i
don't
know
just
where
it
is
in
the
record
because
it's
never
been
brought
into
question
in
this
proceeding.
but
the
petition
is
beginning
on
page
1
of
the
record,
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no
sir,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
he
was
not
because
he
told
me
that
he
would
not
consult
his
list
for
that
purpose
regardless
of
what
information
we
had
and
there
was
no
use
in
us
sitting
there
and
going
through
the
proceedings
of
asking
him
one
after
the
other.
he
said,
he
wouldn't
consult
it
in
regard
to
any
of
them.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
by
name.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
by
name?
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no
sir.
if
you
will
look,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
it
in
his
entire
testimony,
he's
--
admits
that
his
membership
is
about
a
thousand
people.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
he
doesn't
know
the
names
of
all
of
them.
but
sometimes
he
doesn't
--
he
knows
the
name
and
sometimes
he
doesn't
connect
the
name
with
the
person
with
the
face,
the
features,
the
identities.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
we're
all
human
in
that
regard.
and
for
me,
i
just
give
him
a
name.
you
see,
i
asked
him
about
these
specific
14,
the
first
14
because
i
had
photographs
of
those
individuals.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
and
i
could
associate
that
name
with
the
face
for
him.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir
and
of
course,
he
knew
some
of
those
14
but
he
didn't
know
them
as
members
of
the
naacp.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
another
witness
in
this
case,
sands
knew
i
think
eight
of
these
members
of
the
communist
party
when
the
pictures
were
exhibited
to
him,
and
he
puts
three
of
them
in
meetings
of
the
naacp,
but
you
see
mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
handicapped
in
regard
of
these
other
33
people,
i
had
no
photograph
of
them
and
if
i'm
going
to
ask
him,
does
he
know
john
jones,
i
don't
know
whether
we're
talking
about
if
he
knows
john
jones,
nobody
knows
whether
we're
talking
about
the
same
person
or
not.
and
the
thing
i
would
say
after
this,
we
don't
care
anything
about
having
possession
of
this
list
of
the
naacp.
the
court
had
ruled
in
alabama
versus
naacp
that
that's
impermissible.
we
recognize
the
binding
effect
of
that
decision,
but
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that
would've
been
the
end
as
far
as
abe
sorkin
is
concerned,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that
would've
been
the
end
as
far
as
abe
sorkin
was
concerned,
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i'd
had
to
stop
there
under
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
if
you
read
their
decision,
that's
why
they
directed
me
to
stop.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no
sir.
we
couldn't
have
done
that
and
we
wouldn't
have
attempted
to
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
makes
it
clear
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
do
that.
we
must
rely
on
the
integrity
of
the
witness
in
this
instance.
if
he
wants
to
perjure
himself,
if
every
man
we
asked
about
the
[inaudible]
on
that
list
he
could
tell
us,
no
one
would
be
hung
with
that.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
but
our
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
mr.
justice
black,
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
as
to
what
legislative
purpose
other
than
to
gain
information
was
to
be
served.
now,
there
are
many
purposes.
let
me
say,
i
think
one
of
the
justices
on
this
end
of
the
bench
over
here,
raised
one
yesterday
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
we
all
know
for
instance
that
is,
so
far
as
the
communist
agitation
in
this
country
to
foment
a
racial
strife
or
strife
any
racial
situations
and
actual
violence.
now,
it
may
be
that
we
need
state
legislation
to
curve
that,
depending
on
whether
we
have
sufficient
infiltration
or
not
in
fact.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
to
make
it
an
offense
to
encourage
violence
around
any
or
sort
of
a
racial
situation.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
we
have
no
such
laws.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
think
we
have
not.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
think
we
have
not
in
that
particular
instant.
another
great
area
of
uncertainty
has
arisen
in
regard
to
what
the
effect
of
our
state's
subversive
statute
is
since
your
decision
in
nelson
against
pennsylvania.
now,
i'm
satisfied
in
my
own
mind
that
this
court
left
open
to
the
states
in
that
decision
the
right
to
proscribe
and
punish
subversive
action
directed
towards
the
state
itself
but
not
against
the
federal
government.
i
think
that's
the
effect
of
that
decision,
but
i
think
our
statute
directly
is
tied
up
with
practically
the
same
wording,
in
the
same
effect
as
in
--
as
the
pennsylvania
statue
was
when
nelson
was
prosecuted.
and
the
legitimate
legislative
purpose
of
the
florida
legislature
determined
whether
or
not
there's
sufficient
communist
activity
in
the
state
of
florida
to
justify
redrafting
that
statute
so
as
to
make
it
clearly
aimed
at
subversion
directed
against
a
state
alone.
another
legitimate
purpose
in
my
judgment,
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
subversive
activity
in
the
state
is
sufficiently
extensive,
that
the
legislature
of
florida
would
want
to
exercise
its
right
under,
i
think
it's
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution,
to
get
the
state
legislatures
to
attempt
to
initiate
a
constitutional
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
to
permit
the
states
to
enforce
subversive
statutes
against
subversion
aimed
at
the
united
states
government
itself
as
well
as
the
states
in
spite
of
your
honor's
decision
in
nelson
against
pennsylvania.
i
think
the
state
has
a
right
of
self-preservation
if
your
honor
please,
the
same
as
the
federal
government
has
and
i
think
there
are
many
areas
than
legitimate
areas
for
the
state
to
operate
in,
in
the
field
of
subversion.
i
know
that
we've
taken
testimony
in
other
hearings
where
we
had
competent
witnesses
to
prove
that
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
communist
party
of
this
country
is
to
obliterate
the
states
because
they
look
at
them
as
individual
packets
of
resistance.
there's
no
doubt
at
all
that
the
communist
conspiracy
involved
action
against
the
state
itself
as
well
as
the
federal
government
is
an
interest.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
--
the
counsel
mr.
justice
black.
and
i
have
been
the
counsel
of
this
committee
that
ever
had
--
let
me
say
this
to
you
since
its
inception
and
i'm
a
criminal
defense
lawyer
by
nature
and
by
training.
i
don't
think
anybody
could
have
anymore
appreciation
of
a
man's
rights
than
i
have.
i've
made
my
living
upholding
and
defending
individual
rights.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
they're
not
colored?
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
all
of
them
are
not
colored
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
go
ahead.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
well,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
--
may
i
ask
--
may
i
answer
that
in
this
way?
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
you've
got
from
congressional
committee
was
over
here
on
capitol
hill
and
they're
going
to
be
holding
some
hearings
in
regard
to
interstate
commerce
and
in
regard
to
the
assignment
of
televisions
stations,
you're
having
some
scandal
up
here
about
that
now.
i
want
to
say
to
you
sir,
if
you
proscribe
in
this
committee's
investigation,
you're
going
to
prescribe
that
one,
that
the
witnesses
are
going
and
come
before
that
committee
over
there
and
they're
going
to
say,
“wait
a
minute,
under
the
u.s.
supreme
court's
decision,
you
can't
make
me
testify
about
my
association
with
the
people
that
i'm
--
have
duty
to
conspired
with
to
get
this
channel
for
television
unlawfully.”
now,
what
value?
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
the
value
of
it
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
well,
you
see
mr.
justice
black,
if
i
may
be
perfectly
frank,
the
difficulty
with
your
question
is
that
it
encompasses
your
belief
that
we
are
trying
to
do
something
other
than
operate
legitimately
in
the
legislature
in
florida.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
and
i
can't
answer
that
question.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
want
to
say
this
to
you
mr.
justice
black.
any
information
had
been
recognized
by
this
court
and
all
the
other
courts
for
years,
any
information
vying
upon
matters
as
subject,
the
proper
subject
to
a
proper
legislation.
any
such
information
this
court
has
always
said
the
committees
of
the
congress
over
here
entitled
to
have
to
enlighten
them
and
whatever
agreed
it
might
be
competent
to
enlighten
them
and
(inaudible)
the
past
legislation
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
you've
answered
that
question
in
the
uphaus
case
if
your
honor
please.
you've
said,
communist
investigation
in
the
state
is
an
overriding
stated
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
--
puts
it
to
rest
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
understand
that
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that's
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
but
your
honor,
this
court
as
a
composite
group
held
in
that
case
that
the
motive
of
the
investigators
could
not
be
considered.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
now,
that
was
immaterial.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
well,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that
wouldn't
be
limited
in
my
judgment
to
the
imagination
of
the
members
of
the
legislature
and
what
they
wanted
to
affect
by
way
of
legislation.
let
me
say
this
to
you
sir
that
in
the
instance
of
the
white
citizens
council
and
the
ku
klux
klan
that
we've
investigated,
we
examined
our
statutes
very
carefully
and
we
found
that
we
had
criminal
statutes
on
the
books
to
--
that
undoubtedly
covered
any
illegal
activities
or
any
violent
activities
of
those
organizations
were
engaged
in.
now,
you've
got
other
situation
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no
sir,
because
the
ku
klux
klan
and
the
white
citizens
council
does
not
operate
like
the
communist
party
operation,
mr.
justice
black.
they
don't
operate
by
direction.
they
don't
go
out
and
put
on
their
robes
and
get
out
and
then
grab
up
a
fellow
and
take
him
out
and
flog
him,
if
you
please.
now,
the
naacp
in
its
national
convention
tells
you
something
about
how
they
operate
and
we
read
that
in
page
7
of
the
appendix
here.
they
operate
through
organizations
and
the
more
you
know
about
an
operation
of
that
type,
the
more
your
imagination
will
help
you
to
put
together
legislation
that
might
be
useful
in
combating
it.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
they
don't
have
one,
but
we
identify
the
members
of
the
ku
klux
klan
mr.
chief
justice
and
we
had
many
members
up
there
testifying
for
the
committee,
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
we
did
in
fact
get
a
membership
list
to
the
white
citizens
council,
seabord
white
citizens
council
which
was
john
kasper's
organization
in
florida
and
miami,
headed
by
a
man
named
david
hackett.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
hackett,
brought
it
right
into
the
hearing
room,
turning
over
to
us.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
the
only
one
that
i'm
aware
of
and
this
was
--
john
remained
a
member
of
--
john
kasper,
i
think
a
very
respectful
character.
he
was
messing
around
down
in
your
state
of
alabama
down
there
in
election.
just
before
he
came
down
there
and
we
served
a
subpoena
on
him.
he
had
only
one
chapter
in
florida
at
that
time
and
it
was
in
miami
and
hackett
was
his
man
down
there
and
he
brought
the
membership
list
right
on
up
to
the
capitol
in
dallas
and
turned
it
over
to
us,
subject
to
our
subpoenas.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
none
--
i'm
sure
he
does
have.
i'm
sure
that
he
does
have
but
they
have
not
taken
any
--
and
there's
no
evidence
that
they
have
taken
any
violent
position
in
the
state
of
florida
as
i
read
in
the
press,
they
have
in
other
states
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir,
frankly
located.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that
was
some
time
ago
before
this
argument
developed,
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no
sir.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
what
i
mean
in
the
statement,
this
is
a
very
broad
statement
and
i
mean
by
communist
activities,
infiltration
by
communist
party
members
or
members
of
other
subversive
organization.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
do
not
say
that.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
i
do
not
say
that
at
all.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
and
determine
the
extent
of
it
if
any.
we
know
there
are
some.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no
sir,
not
just
the
14
names.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
the
entire
testimony
of
sergeant
strickland,
the
testimony
of
ruth
perry,
the
testimony
of
[inaudible],
the
testimony
of
arlington
sands
and
the
resolutions
of
the
naacp
itself,
all
of
these
things.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no,
they
have
said
we've
got
some
other.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that
was
the
one
that
i
had
the
pictures
of.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that's
right.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
that's
true.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
unquestionably
mr.
justice
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
now
i
want
to
go
a
little
step
further
than
that.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
of
every
person
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
--
i
asked
him
about
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir,
no
doubt
about
it
mr.
justice.
i
want
to
say
this
--
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
and
these
are
not
to
all
the
organization
we've
investigated
in
florida
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
names
and
numbers.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
justice
clark,
in
the
absurdity
of
the
position,
it
seems
to
me
it
was
illustrated
by
counsel's
statement
to,
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
or
mr.
justice
white
yesterday
that
he
conceded
that
we
hadn't
the
right
to
ask
reverend
gibson
if
they
had
any
communist
in
the
miami
branch.
but
we
didn't
have
the
right
to
say,
"now,
here's
two
communists
and
do
you
have
them
particularly
in
the
branch?"
now
that's
the
whole
situation
if
your
honors
please,
you
just
lose
reasons
somewhere
along
this
line
in
my
judgment.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
based
strictly
on
his
recollection
of
the
name.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
of
the
name
alone,
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
lived
in
a
certain
address.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
assuming
that
he
had
that
kind
of
information
about
the
individual,
it
might
have
identified
them
in
his
mind.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
there
have
been
many
if
your
honor
please,
like
the
southern
conference
educational
fund
that
is
mentioned
here.
i
think
there's
been
probably
a
dozen
or
more.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
we
have
investigated
in
some
areas
of
the
labor
movement
in
the
florida
in
regard
to
this
sort
of
infiltration.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
no
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
schools?
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
r.
hawes
there
has
been
some
proposed
and
not
passed
and
there
has
been
some
proposed
as
a
work
of
this
committee
and
passed,
in
regard
for
instance
to
fingerprinting
certain
employees
of
the
state
government.
we've
investigated
infiltration
of
the
state
government
in
various
agencies
down
there.
and
one
bill
that
i
think
of
now
that
we
passes
all
of
these
investigations
was
a
bill
requiring
the
fingerprinting
of
our
employees
permissibly
and
this
section
of
the
legislature,
i'm
sure
we
will
have
the
necessary
public
opinion
molded
to
passing
mandatory
to
all
our
school
teachers
and
all
public
employees
in
florida.
but
we've
investigated
many
organizations,
just
not
the
purpose
of
this
committee
to
just
to
smear
naacp
at
all.
any
other
questions?
