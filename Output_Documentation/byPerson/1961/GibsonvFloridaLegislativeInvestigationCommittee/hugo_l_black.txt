justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
repeating
why
do
you
--
what
is
the
standard
by
which
you
say
the
state
did
not
have
or
did
have
an
overriding
interest
at
one
time
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
contend
that
this
interest
is
simulated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
facts
on
that
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
evidence
on
that
fact
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
findings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
someone
had
sworn
it,
it's
your
idea
that
then
they
would
have
the
right
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
--
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
this
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
the
same
--
were
they
the
same
type
of
inquiry
as
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
questions
were
asked
in
braden?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
be
different
--
would
it
be
different
in
your
judgment
if
there
had
been
some
witness
of
some
kind
who
had
told
them
that
he
was
a
communist?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
--
did
they
claim
that
there
was
any
evidence
that
they
were
members
of
the
--
of
your
organization
were
also
members
of
the
communist
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
your
constitutional
question
will
be
different
had
your
controversy
had
arisen
in
oregon
or
maine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
constitutional
question
would
be
different?
you're
association
instead
of
being
association
of
colored
people
was
an
association
of
white
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
--
you
mean
that
the
cons
--
are
you
agreeing
and
i
think
you'd
have
other
basis
maybe
and
so
on
and
something
that's
unclear,
are
you
agreeing
in
that
instance,
(inaudible)
first
amendment,
if
you
review
--
refer
to
the
first
amendment
applies
differently,
people
of
different
races
in
different
parts
of
the
country
or
to
different
groups
in
different
parts
of
the
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
maybe
wrong
but
as
i
recall
it,
what
you
called
the
connective
link
in
uphaus
was
evidence
that
that
some
communist
had
been
at
this
(inaudible).
as
i
understand
this
record,
it
is
claimed
here
communists
had
been
naacp
leaders
in
florida,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
were
trying
to
prove
it
by
asking
the
witness
before
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
likelihood
that
they
could
have
found
any
witness
who
has
known
better
who
were
the
witnesses
--
members
in
this
particular
man?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall,
there
was
a
suggestion
in
most
of
these
cases
if
they
could
ask
the
witnesses
themselves.
justice
hugo
l.
black
ask
questions
themselves,
not
the
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
persons
who
were
accused
of
being
communists.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
florida
law
now
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
cited
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
proceedings
started
against
the
naacp
directly
in
order
to
forfeit
its
order
or
anything
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
connection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
also
present
a
question
would
it
not
under
numerous
cases,
whether
assuming
the
power
of
the
state
to
conduct
investigation
looking
at
the
whole
circumstances
involved
and
what
is
being
done,
the
rights
of
the
individuals
to
associates,
the
purpose
they
have,
the
power
of
the
state
the
fact
informational
rather
the
second
offenses
[inaudible]
this
court
would
say
under
this
--
these
cases,
the
interest
of
the
state
is
sufficient
to
override
these
constitutional
protections
to
the
individuals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
don't
know
that
there
is
any
difference
in
the
question
i
asked
you
to
the
one
my
brother
brennan
did.
but
i
want
to
see
if
you
are
--
if
you
have
changed
your
view
as
to
the
question
i
asked
you.
let
us
assume
that
the
record
does
present
evidence
which
the
courts
apply
you
think
to
be
sufficient
or
substantial
to
connect
these
people
up
with
--
at
least
some
of
them
that
would
--
some
kind
of
activity.
and
that
therefore,
you
find
the
power
on
the
part
of
the
state,
conduct
an
investigation
of
this
kind
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
abstractly.
you
also
have
facing
over
on
the
other
side
of
that,
a
constitutional
power,
constitutional
rights
of
individuals
to
associate
for
the
legal
purposes
of
protecting
that
constitutional
right.
i
understood
you
to
answer
me
a
while
ago
that
you
are
insisting
that
even
under
those
circumstances,
the
interest
of
the
state
in
doing
what
it
wants
to
do,
must
great
or
must
be
thought
under
all
the
circumstances
to
outweigh
the
interest
of
the
individuals
into
exercising
their
constitutional
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
but
i
want
to
be
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
hawes,
may
ask
you.
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
and
i
want
to
make
sure,
what
you
would
do
with
the
name,
what
purpose
it
would
serve
after
you
got
them?
the
declaration
of
the
committee
as
to
why
it
wanted
them
and
what
it
would
do
with
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
make
them
public.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
do
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
not
have
laws
to
that
effect
over
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wonder
--
i
think
you
have
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
a
member
of
the
legislator
--
leture
or
just
the
counsel
for
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
ask
you
this
simple
question
because
i
have
a
difficulty
in
the
proceeding,
maybe
if
it's
true,
legislatively
speaking,
why
the
names
of
14
people
in
florida,
in
fact
the
14
particular
people,
colored
people,
might
have
belonged
to
some
organizations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
white
and
colored?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
that
was
aid
--
material
in,
maybe
the
law
is
that
it
doesn't
make
any
--
it
has
--
didn't
have
to
be
material,
is
it?
why
that
would
be
any
material
aid
in
framing
the
legislation
to
prevent
--
turn
up
the
racial
violence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
maybe
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
might
be
of
--
because
--
not
be
a
problem
there,
might
they
not,
in
any
legislation
as
to
how
i'm
quoted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
–
specifically,
certain
specific
knowledge
about
certain
specific
individuals
doing
something
which
many
people
thinks
wrong
would
--
how
useful
that
would
be
in
connection
with
the
present
legislation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
not
necessarily
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
necessarily
to
be
that
at
all.
frequently
people
legitimately,
they
want
to
do
things
but
maybe
they
are
forbidden
to
do
by
the
constitution.
that
doesn't
mean
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
enlighten
him
in
the
passage
of
legislation
within
their
comity
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
court,
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
question
is
--
does
that
--
the
question
i'm
asking
was
based
on
the
criminals
could
possibly
[inaudible]
and
maybe
have
been
said
in
some
of
our
cases,
the
question
of
how
important
that
legislative
purpose
is
as
compared
with
the
freedom
of
association
guaranteed
by
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
said
abstractly?
or
i
--
or
rather
--
well,
i
didn't
agree
with
that
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said
–
[inaudible]
abstractly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
it
was
made
in
the
abstract
rule
that
any
time
there
was
a
legislature
who
wanted
any
information
at
all
about
communism,
all
other
rights
would
be
subordinated
to
it.
i
thought
that
that
case
went
more
largely
on
the
basis
that
you
had
to
consider
if
necessity,
overriding
the
certainty
of
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
wasn't
at
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
not
talking
about
motives
and
i
didn't
intend
to.
i
simply
wanted
to
ask,
what
purpose
in
your
mind
--
how
much
assistance
was
given
to
the
legislature
if
it
succeeded
in
getting
this
man,
give
these
14
names
that
he
brought
in
his
record.
how
much
could
one
reasonably
say
that
would
happen
in
the
passage
of
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
it
did
--
i
am
[inaudible]
in
the
passage
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
not
cover
it
with
reference
to
other
organizations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
only
one
there?
is
that
the
only
citizens
council
in
the
state
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
have
any
competitors
of
the
citizens
council
at
that
time?
