justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
did
not
refute
to
say
whether
among
the
thousand
were
these
14
or
any
other?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
say
subversive
mr.
carter,
is
that
synonym
for
members
of
the
communist
party
in
the
context
of
this
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
carter,
would
you
summarize
it?
perhaps,
you've
already
done
it,
i
hope
i
haven't
missed
it.
exactly
what
there
was
in
the
record
which
identified
anyone
who
had
membership
in
the
naacp?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
as
to
the
14,
mr.
carter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
they're
separate
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
there's
no
other
reference
to
the
33?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
evidence
at
all
about
them,
about
any
connection
of
the
--
that
they
might
have
in
the
naacp?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
carter,
may
i
peruse
this
a
little
differently?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i
get
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
what
you've
been
saying
is
this.
we
may
assume
the
constitutionality
of
this
kind
of
legislative
inquiry.
we
may
assume
also
that
it
was
an
inquiry
which
had
a
valid
legislative
objective.
but
that
nevertheless,
before
there
may
be
an
encroachment
upon
the
first
amendment
protections
which
you
rely
upon,
there
has
to
be
substantial
evidence
of
actual
communist
activities
by
the
organization
before
these
questions
can
be
put
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
doing
is
saying
that,
or
are
you,
that
factually,
this
record
is
more
like
the
sweezy
record
where
this
court
found
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
progressive
party
engaged
in
communist
activities
and
therefore,
questions
put
to
dr.
sweezy
about
the
progressive
party
could
not
be
put,
even
assuming
the
validity
of
the
new
hampshire
legislative
inquiry
in
the
subversive
activity.
and
that
this
is
like
the
sweezy
record
and
not
like
the
uphaus
record
where
the
court
found
that
the
world
federation
or
whatever
that
thing
is
called,
that
the
uphaus
was
connected
with
in
fact
was
engaged
in
activities
which
at
least
to
a
majority
of
this
court
satisfied
the
requisite
of
proof,
substantial
proof
of
activities
by
the
organization
itself
under
inquiry.
is
that
your
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
assumed
in
my
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
assumed
in
my
question
that
--
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
could
assume
that
it
had
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
could
assume
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
was
constitutionally
permissible,
namely
subversive.
and
yet,
before
the
questions
can
be
put
before
they
could
put
the
encroachment
on
the
first
amendment
rights
that
you
are
asserting,
there
has
to
be
this
substantial
evidence
of
activity,
subversive
activity
by
the
organization
under
inquiry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
reach
it
if
in
fact
the
evidence
doesn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
show
a
link
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
organization
with
the
subversive
activities
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
not
suggesting
surely
that
because
the
association
undertook
to
recognize
the
problem
to
deal
with
it
which
i
am
sure
it
has
tried
to
deal
with
it,
that
insulated
it
from
official
inquiry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
that
very
question
mr.
carter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
that
very
question,
how
many
chapters
does
naacp
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
about
1500
chapters.
now
these
resolutions
which
as
i
recall
it
are
dated
from
1950
or
thereabout?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
--
the
miami
chapter
or
whatever
--
what
--
is
that
--
we're
dealing
here
with
the
miami
chapter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
there
may
be
said
in
those
resolutions
is
there
any
identification
of
the
attempted
infiltration
referred
to
in
those
resolution,
with
the
miami
chapter
as
such?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
then
may
i
ask,
if
there
isn't,
now
you
answered
to
mr.
justice
harlan
that
nevertheless
those
resolutions
might
be
a
relevant
factor
and
what
puzzles
me
is
how
can
they
--
those
resolutions
which
make
no
reference
to
the
miami
chapter
as
i
understand
it,
be
relevant
to
the
conditions
within
the
miami
chapter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
organization
does.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
we
have
here
is
the
state
of
florida
making
an
inquiry
into
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
miami
chapter
of
the
organization.
now,
i
ask
again
--
i'm
a
little
puzzled
how
the
facts
that
the
organization
as
an
organization
had
a
problem
bears
on
whether
or
not
there
is
attempted
infiltration
of
the
miami
chapter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
wrong
--
i
thought
that
among
the
truths
that
the
court
relied
on
in
that
case,
were
these
that
the
--
some
of
the
speakers
at
world
fellowship
meeting
were
admitted
communists.
that
dr.
uphaus
himself
had
attended
that
warsaw
convention
where
the
united
states
was
censured
for
using
germ
warfare
allegedly
in
korea
and
there
were
communist
pamphlets,
some
wanted
by
smaller
talk.
the
evidence
was
were
distributed
at
meetings
of
the
world
fellowship.
now,
wasn't
that
rather
a
different
record
than
we
have
here,
that
is
as
regards
--
the
activities
of
that
organization,
world
fellowship,
and
the
activities
of
the
miami
branch
of
the
naacp
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
of
these
were
actual
activities
of
world
fellowship.
these
are
meetings
of
the
world
fellowship
addressed
by
these
individuals
who
the
record
showed
actually
admitted
that
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
does
as
to
sorkin
or
does
it
not?
i'm
looking
at
page
93.
have
you
seen
him
in
any
naacp
meetings?
i've
seen
him
occasionally
at
--
very
rarely
at
the
public
meetings
to
which
anybody
can
come
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
also
disclaimed
any
knowledge
whether
sorkin
was
a
member
of
the
naacp,
did
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
--
the
petition
holding
contempt
was
here
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
we
have
a
petition
here,
do
we
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
which
the
conviction
is
based,
is
that
the
one
at
page
1?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
mr.
carter's
point
mr.
hawes
that
i
think
he
made
it,
did
he
not
that,
suppose
reverend
gibson
had
produced
the
membership
list
and
you
had
asked
him,
is
abe
sorkin
included
in
your
membership?
and
he
looked
to
the
list
and
said
no,
would
you
have
stopped
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
beg
pardon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
supposed
he'd
taken
reverend
graham
and
said
this,
"is
his
name
listed?"
and
he
looked
at
the
list
and
he
says,
"no."
would
you
be
content
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
you
could
not
have
asked
that
the
list
be
produced
to
confirm
whether
or
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he's
truthfully
answering
he
know
that
reverend
graham's
name
is
not
on
the
list?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
there
were
other
organization
and
you
mentioned
the
ku
klux
klan
and
the
white
citizens
council,
as
well
as
the
naacp,
what
other
organizations
have
you
made
this
inquiry
of?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
category
--
for
example,
have
you
made
this
inquiry
of
labor
organizations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
churches?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
has
there
actually
been
any
legislation
proposed
in
--
as
a
result
of
(voice
