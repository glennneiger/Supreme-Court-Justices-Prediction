do
you
think
your
--
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
connection
--
that
is,
the
connection
in
the
point
you're
now
making
is
that
you
weren't
--
you
had
no
interest
in
sending
the
reverend,
mr.
gibson's
to
jail
but
rather
were
interested
in
getting
the
information.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
this
court
should
decide
that
--
that
you
were
right,
that
you
were
entitled
to
have
him
bring
with
him
the
membership
list
so
that
he
could
refer
to
them
in
answering
questions
about
specific
individuals,
would
he
be
given
a
locus
penitentiary
or
would
he
have
to
serve
six
months
in
jail?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
assume
of
course
that
you
are
civilized
and
i
am
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
(voice
overlap)
--
i
just
--
was
looking
at
the
judgment
of
the
court.
it's
a
judgment
of
a
six
months
sentence
in
jail
whether
--
or
whether
$1200
fine
with
no
opportunity
to
--
to
purge
oneself
in
that
sentence
by
answering
the
question.
isn't
that
though
--
isn't
that
the
form
of
the
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
been
stayed
pending
his
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
coming
to
this
court
and
so
that
he's
--
he's
certainly
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
were
talking
about
the
uphaus
case
before.
as
i
remember
the
uphaus
case,
mr.
uphaus,
right
up
until
the
very
--
at
any
time
sort
of
avoided
going
to
jail
by
simply
answering
the
questions.
and
--
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
the
case
here
that
that
was
--
that's
the
matter
to
which
i
was
directing
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
your
point
that
without
a
showing
of
that,
this
petitioner
needn't
have
done
even
as
much
as
he
did,
he
could
have
refused
to
answer
anything,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
who
was
mr.
sands?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
what
was
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
naacp?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
there
were
testimony
by
witnesses
that
the
members
of
the
communist
party
were
interested
and
one
of
their
objectives
was
to
promote
interracial
violence,
wouldn't
that
support
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
any
such
members
were
--
had
infiltrated
an
organization
as
to
the
national
association
advancement
of
colored
people
--
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
it's
a
very
legitimate
state
interest
to
prevent
bloodshed
and
violence,
is
it
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
within
their
borders.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
would
have
been
--
be
a
very
legitimate
inquiry
would
it
not
if
there
were
evidence
before
a
legislative
committee
that
members
of
a
particular
group
were
bent
on
promoting
interracial
violence
and
wouldn't
it
then
be
a
legitimate
inquiry
to
find
what
if
any
organizations
and
such
communist
members
had
infiltrated,
whether
it'd
be
the
white
citizens
council
or
the
ku
klux
klan
or
whatever.
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
rotary
club?
justice
potter
stewart
on
page
25,
strickland
said
that
at
one
--
that
one
--
according
to
his
own
testimony,
he
was
at
one
time
a
member
of
the
naacp.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
now
talking
about
sorkin
again.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
--
but
you've
made
clear
i
think,
have
you
not
that
the
reverend
mr.
gibson
was
entitled
to
--
have
you
explained
the
relevance
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
to
each
name?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
