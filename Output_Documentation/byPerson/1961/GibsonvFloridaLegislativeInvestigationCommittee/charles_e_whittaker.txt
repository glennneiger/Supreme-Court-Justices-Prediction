then
this
involved
as
i
understand
it
14
names
out
of
a
thousand?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
would
be
of
a
negative
character
and
i
suppose
that
his
testimony
was
true
and
all
he
would
say
if
he
had
the
list,
my
answer
is
no.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
would
be
no
revelation
of
any
contents
of
the
list
save
in
that
negative
word?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
didn't
mean
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
produced
mr.
carter
now?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
might
as
be
--
the
court's
order
though
has
expressly
said
to
--
that
the
list
shall
not
be
required
to
leave
the
hands
of
the
witness,
he
uses
it
only
for
verification.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
another
case,
isn't
it?
