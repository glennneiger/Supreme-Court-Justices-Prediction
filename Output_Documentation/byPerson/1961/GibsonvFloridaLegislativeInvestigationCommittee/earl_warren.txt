mr.

chief

warren
that
the
man
used
the
--
the
man
used
the
list
originally
to
testify
from?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
--
mr.
carter,
i
understood
you
a
moment
ago
to
distinguish
uphaus
from
this
case
on
--
on
the
ground
that
in
uphaus,
the
committee
did
have
some
evidence
that
subversives
had
frequented
this
--
this
place
and
you
say
that
in
this
one,
in
your
case,
there
is
no
such
evidence,
therefore
you
distinguish
the
two
cases
but
you
go
on
to
say
that
even
if
they
had
to
--
if
there
had
been
evidence
that
there
were
subversives
in
--
in
your
--
in
your
organization
or
at
least
so
testified
to
that
that
they
still
couldn't
do
it.
now,
i
--
i
can't
quite
follow
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
hawes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
carter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carter
would
you
--
would
you
briefly
again
distinguish
this
case
from
uphaus
for
me,
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understood
you
to
say
further
that
you
thought
that
--
that
they
could
not,
by
further
evidence
of
a
link,
establish
facts
which
would
entitle
them
to
this
list
in
your
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
thing
that
troubles
me
is
this.
in
uphaus,
the
facts,
let
us
take
them
as
you
say
it
were
in
this
case,
one
witness
testified
that
14
individuals
were
communists.
another
one
testified
that
he
had
seen
those
people
at
naacp
meetings.
now
--
now,
that
--
if
--
if
we
take
those
facts
as
true,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
where
in
it
can
be
differentiated
from
uphaus.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.

mr.

you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief

earl
warren
mr.
hawes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
the
naacp
meetings
closed
meetings,
closed
to
members
or
is
the
public
entitled
to
go,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
did
this
man
attend,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
read
that
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hawes,
may
i
ask
this
question?
was
reverend
gibson
asked
as
to
whether
he
knew
each
of
these
33
members
that
are
alleged
to
have
been
communists?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
did
tell
you
in
one
of
the
--
on
one
of
the
pages
that
you
called
to
our
attention
that
he
would
tell
you
honestly
whether
he
knew
them
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
whether
they
were
there
--
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
yes,
well
if
you
call
--
or
why
couldn't
you
have
asked
him?
i
don't
say
that's
all
you
have
to
do
but
why
couldn't
you
ask
him?
do
you
know
john
jones?
is
he
a
member
of
the
naacp?
and
he
might
have
cleared
up
most
of
your
difficulties
in
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
we're
all
treated
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did
ask
him
about
all
those
14?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
your
committee
asked
for
and
received
the
membership
list
of
the
ku
klux
klan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
ask
for
and
received
the
membership
of
white
council's?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
get
it
freely
â€“
did
you
get
the
list
through
the
custodian?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
didn't
he
say
he
would
tell
you
as
he
knew
the
fact
to
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
his
knowledge,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
if
you've
--
you
probably
had
some
other
identifying
material
that
you
could
have
given
him,
you
wouldn't
--
you
are
limited
to
just
saying,
do
you
know
john
doe?
you
could
have
said,
do
you
know
that
john
doe
who
lived
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
such
and
such
of
place
and
who
is
--
have
these
activities
and
so
forth
and
you
could
have
done
those
things
had
you
wanted
to
do
it,
couldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
you
used
up
your
time,
i
didn't
know
if
you
have,
but
that
what
it
--
i
think
you
had
three
minutes
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
not.
