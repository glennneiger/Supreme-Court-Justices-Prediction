mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
to
review
a
decision
modifying
upon
the
court's
own
motion,
a
cease-and-desist
order
entered
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
upon
the
stipulation
and
consent
of
the
respondents.
the
respondents
having
signed
that
stipulation
and
consent
have
taken
no
further
part
in
these
proceedings.
the
question
presented
as
we
see
it
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
may
properly
modify
as
too
broad
a
cease-and-desist
order
entered
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
where
the
respondents
not
only
raised
no
objection
to
the
scope
of
the
order,
but
actually
consented
to
its
issuance
and
enforcement
in
the
exact
form
in
which
enforcement
was
sought.
i
should
say
that
this
case
is
one
of
a
group.
there
are
two
other
cases
in
which
petitions
have
been
filed
to
review
companion
decisions
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit;
the
las
vegas
sand
and
gravel
case
which
is
number
38
and
local
476
of
the
plumbers
which
is
number
39.
in
addition,
there's
a
petition
pending
in
the
brandman
iron
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
raises
substantially
the
same
question
and
that
in
our
view,
these
cases
are
related
to
the
box
case
which
is
to
be
argued
immediately
after
this
one,
although
the
questions
maybe
somewhat
different.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
all
of
them.
the
brandman
iron
case
is
a
consent
decree
case.
the
plumbers
case
was
not,
and
i
believe
the
las
vegas
case
was
not
a
consent
decree
case.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows,
charges
were
filed
against
the
employer,
ochoa
and
two
labor
organizations
in
1958
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
a
complaint
was
issued
on
february
26,
1959.
the
complaint
appears
at
page
13
of
the
record.
the
complaint
set
out
first
that
ochoa
was
an
employer
subject
to
the
act
of
puerto
rico
because
he
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
it
also
identified
as
the
respondents
a
local
labor
organization,
a
local
of
the
longshoremen's
and
a
counsel
of
local
league
of
labor
organization,
also
representing
employees
seeking
to
organize
employees
in
puerto
rico.
the
allegations
were
that
ochoa
and
the
unions
had
entered
an
illegal
contract
--
entered
into
an
illegal
contract
in
1951
which
established
a
closed
shop
and
illegal
hiring
hall
and
an
illegal
checkoff,
all
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
so
far
as
the
employer
was
concerned
and
8
(b)
so
far
as
the
union
was
concerned.
the
complaint
set
forth
that
the
agreement
had
been
renewed
in
1955
and
that
at
all
times
between
1951
at
the
issuance
of
the
complaint,
the
employer
and
the
labor
union
had
maintained
the
agreement
and
given
effect
to
it.
you'll
recall
it
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
any
form
of
union
security
that
is
any
form
of
closed
shop,
union
shop
or
checkoff
is
illegal
unless
the
union
has
been
designated
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
an
appropriate
unit,
so
that
the
contract
and
its
maintenance
were
illegal
according
to
the
complaint
under
that
provision.
second,
it's
settled
law
that
a
closed
shop,
one
which
requires
an
employee
to
be
a
member
of
the
union
before
he
is
hired
and
a
hiring
hall,
one
which
enables
the
union
to
hire
the
man
for
the
employer
are
both
illegal
regardless
of
whether
the
union
has
the
majority
so
that
according
to
the
complaint,
there
was
a
case
under
that
branch
of
the
law
also.
a
period
of
time
then
went
by
and
in
january
1960,
the
respondents,
the
employer
and
the
two
labor
organizations,
the
local
and
the
counsel
entered
into
a
stipulation.
the
stipulation
appears
at
21
of
the
record
and
following.
it
recites
the
charge
and
the
complaint
and
then
sets
forth
the
facts
necessary
to
give
the
board
jurisdiction
relating
to
interstate
commerce,
contrary
to
the
statement
in
the
court
of
appeals,
there
was
no
admission
or
denial
of
the
board's
allegations.
that
indeed
is
not
practice
in
entering
into
consent
orders
in
national
labor
relations
board
cases.
the
stipulation
then
went
on
and
set
forth
in
precise
terms,
the
order
which
was
to
be
entered
by
the
board
and
you
will
find
the
order
as
recited
in
the
stipulation
and
as
ultimately
entered
by
the
board
beginning
at
page
24
of
the
record.
insofar
as
the
employer
is
concerned,
ochoa,
it
was
ordered,
i
am
just
below
the
middle
of
page
24,
to
cease-and-desist
from
performing,
maintaining
or
otherwise
giving
effect
to
any
agreement,
arrangement,
practice
or
understanding
with
ila
council
or
ila
local
1762,
those
were
the
two
respondent
unions
or
any
other
labor
organizations,
those
are
the
controversial
words
as
this
case
arises,
to
cease
from
giving
effect
to
any
understanding
with
these
two
locals
or
with
any
other
labor
organization
which
in
an
unlawful
manner
conditions
employment
or
the
retention
of
the
employment
upon
clearance
or
approval
by
the
aforementioned
labor
organization.
in
other
words,
this
forbad
the
employer
to
maintain
a
hiring
hall
arrangement
with
these
unions
or
any
other
unions.
the
next
paragraph
(b)
forbids
the
employer
to
enter
in
to
or
give
effect
to
any
illegal
union
security
contract,
again,
with
these
unions
or
any
other
labor
organization
and
again,
the
words
any
other
labor
organizations
are
in
question.
there's
no
controversy
concerning
paragraph
(c),
then
(d)
forbids
the
employer
to
encourage
membership
in
a
labor
organization
either
these
or
any
other
by
discriminating
in
regard
to
hire
or
tenure
employment.
and
again,
there
is
a
controversy
over
the
words
or
any
other
labor
organization.
it's
perhaps
worth
pointing
out
also
the
provisions
or
the
controversies
that
over
on
page
26,
the
order
went
on
to
require
the
employer
not
only
to
withdraw
recognition
from
these
unions
but
specifically
to
join
with
the
unions
in
reimbursing
the
employees
for
their
checked
off
dues.
i
say
that
because
this
suggests
that
the
board
--
local
board
authorities
regarded
this,
a
fairly
important
case,
when
the
employer
entered
into
this
order
which
involved
monetary
liability
that
he
can
hardly
have
consented
to
it
later.
the
provisions
directed
to
the
labor
organizations,
began
on
page
27.
i
won't
trouble
the
court
to
read
them.
they
are
the
parallel
or
converse
of
the
provisions
relating
to
the
employer
and
they
ordered
the
union
not
to
enter
into
such
contract,
not
to
establish
hiring
halls
and
not
to
induce
employers
to
encourage
or
discourage
membership
in
the
labor
organization
and
restrain
the
union
from
doing
that
not
only
in
relation
to
ochoa,
the
particular
employer
with
respect
to
whom
the
unfair
labor
practice
was
committed
but
any
other
employer
and
again,
it's
the
words
any
other
employer
that
are
in
controversy.
the
board
in
due
course,
entered
an
order
in
the
precise
terms
of
the
stipulation
and
then
following
the
stipulation,
it
filed
the
petition
for
enforcement
of
the
order
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
board
--
the
court
of
appeals
then
entered
its
decree,
modifying
the
board's
order
by
striking
out
the
phrase
“any
other
employer”
or
“any
other
labor
organization”
wherever
it
occurred.
the
board
filed
this.
it's
been
handled
simply
on
the
papers
as
a
routine
manner.
the
board
then
filed
a
petition
for
reconsideration
which
was
denied
and
it
filed
a
second
petition
for
reconsideration,
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
first
circuit
decision
was
in
conflict
with
a
case
recently
--
to
then
recently
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
had
--
where
the
second
circuit
had
refused
to
modify
a
similar
consent
order
in
a
case
which
it
was
asked
to
and
did
enforce.
on
the
board's
second
petition
for
reconsideration,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
handed
down
an
opinion
covering
not
only
this
case
but
seven
others.
and
since
there's
no
appearance
here
for
the
respondents
and
of
course
none
for
the
court,
it
seems
to
me
proper
to
go
through
that
opinion
in
some
detail
because
it
represents
the
only
statement
of
the
--
in
justification
of
what
was
done
below.
the
opinion
begins
on
page
60
of
the
record
and
follows
on
from
there.
the
opinion
begins
by
setting
forth
the
facts
of
seven
cases
which
were
then
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
in
all
of
them,
the
respondent
had
committed
unfair
labor
practices
in
relation
either
to
one
employer
or
one
labor
organization,
but
the
decree
enjoined
repetition
of
the
same
identical
unfair
labor
practices
in
relation
to
that
employer
or
labor
organization,
the
one
involved,
or
in
relation
to
any
other
employer
or
unfair
labor
practice.
the
cases
were
quite
different,
but
they
fall
into
three
groups,
and
i
think
it's
convenient
to
think
of
them
that
way.
in
one
group,
the
consisting
of
four
cases,
the
employers
had
engaged
in
conduct
designed
to
discourage
unionization
or
labor
organization
among
their
employees,
the
conduct
varied
little
but
it
was
the
type
of
conduct
which
would
take
place
when
a
union
first
--
might
take
place
--
when
a
union
first
came
and
tried
to
organize
a
new
plan.
and
the
board
had
simply
entered
orders
in
a
well-established
form
approved
by
this
court
in
the
past,
ordering
the
employer
not
to
interfere
with
union
organization
or
to
discourage
joining
this
union
or
any
other
union.
the
second
group
consists
of
one
case,
local
476
or
the
plumbers
union.
it
involved
a
secondary
boycott
that
is
to
say
the
plumbers
union
had
induced
the
employees
of
one
employer
to
stop
doing
their
normal
work
in
order
to
compel
that
employer
to
cease
dealing
with
the
employer
with
whom
the
plumbers
had
their
real
dispute.
the
order
in
this
case
directed
the
respondent
union
not
to
engage
in
inducing
the
employees
of
this
particular
secondary
employer
to
go
on
strike,
but
not
to
induce
the
employees
of
any
other
secondary
employer
to
go
on
strike
for
the
purpose
of
getting
at
primary
employer.
now,
i
say
the
primary
employer
in
its
original
form,
the
order
covered
any
other
primary
employer.
the
board
on
its
petition
for
reconsideration
did
not
ask
the
court
to
restore
that
so
that
what
the
order
finally
came
down
to
in
the
controverted
form
was
an
order
telling
the
union,
“don't
exert
pressure
on
any
secondary
employer
in
order
to
get
this
fellow
with
whom
you
have
to
fight.”
the
third
of
group
of
cases
were
made
up
of
this
ochoa
case
which
is
before
the
court
and
one
other
case
for
puerto
rico
involving
the
same
counsel
of
longshoremen's
labor
organizations,
but
apparently
a
different
local
and
the
facts
of
that
case
were
substantially
the
same
as
this.
so
what
we
--
the
court
had
was
different
kinds
of
unfair
labor
practice,
one,
interference
with
organizational
activity,
the
second,
secondary
boycotts,
and
the
third,
maintenance
of
an
unlawful
closed
shop
contract
and
unlawful
discriminatory
hiring
provisions.
after
going
through
the
facts
of
these
seven
cases,
the
court
concluded
from
them
that
the
board
had
a
marked
propensity
for
entering
blanket
orders
and
that
apparently
the
court
said,
“it
did
this
automatically
in
every
case
without
regard
to
the
specific
facts
of
the
case.”
the
court
then
turned
to
the
law
looking
at
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
express
publishing
case
and
in
the
communications
workers
case
that
was
decided
a
term
or
two
ago.
judge
aldrich
said,
“that
the
rule
was
that
if
a
broad
injunction,”
he
spoke
generally,
those
are
his
phrased
words,
“if
a
broad
injunction
was
going
to
be
entered,
there
must
appear
to
be
some
affirmative
reasons
for
it.”
then
he
took
up
the
suggestions
that
the
board
counsel
had
made
in
the
request
for
reconsideration
and
said
that
there
was
no
merit
to
the
board's
argument
that
from
the
facts
which
appeared
in
the
record,
it
was
not
unreasonable
for
the
board
to
conclude
that
the
respondent
might
engage
in
the
same
misconduct,
vis-à-vis
another
labor
union
or
another
employer.
for
example,
the
board
had
suggested
in
the
cases
involving
employer
discouragement
of
union
organization
that
it
was
reasonable
to
assume
that
if
an
organized
employer
interfered
with
restrained
or
coerced
their
employees
in
getting
ready
to
join
union
(a)
which
was
trying
to
organize
the
plant,
that
it
was
fair
to
infer
that
he
would
probably
engage
in
the
same
misconduct
if
they
began
to
join
some
other
labor
organization.
but
that,
judge
aldrich
said
was
simply
unsubstantiated
supposition
and
was
the
kind
of
unsubstantiated
supposition
that
had
been
held
improper
in
the
--
by
this
court
in
the
communications
workers
case.
then
at
the
top
of
page
66,
he
laid
down
what
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
is
a
general
rule.
in
those
cases
in
which
the
record
makes
it
apparent
that
there
was
for
the
single
party
involved,
we
will
not
grant
it,
in
other
words,
will
not
grant
an
order
broader
that
one
limited
to
the
single
party
involved.
he
then
turned
to
the
consent
cases
which
presented
of
course
a
somewhat
different
problem
than
those
--
in
which
the
order
has
been
entered
after
contest
and
he
concluded
that
the
cheney
california
lumber
case
in
327
u.s.
authorized
the
court
to
assume
responsibility
for
the
order
even
though
the
objection
hadn't
been
raised
below
and
to
set
it
aside
if
it
was
too
broad.
as
he
read
the
case,
the
court
which
we
quite
disagree
with,
the
cheney
case
was
a
holding
that
the
record
must
substantiate
the
order
and
that
it
was
immaterial
and
then
if
that
wasn't
done,
it
was
immaterial
whether
the
point
had
been
raised
below.
he
then
went
on
and
dealt
with
the
board's
argument
that
in
the
consent
cases,
it
must
be
assumed
that
there
were
facts
that
would
warrant
a
broad
order,
and
judge
aldrich
said
as
to
that,
that
the
board
had
entered
too
many
broad
orders
that
it
cried
wolf
too
often
and
that
therefore,
the
court's,
“our
normal
disposition
is
to
assume
in
the
absence
of
a
contrary
showing
that
the
case
is
an
ordinary
one
rather
than
a
special
case
calling
for
extraordinary
relief.”
and
then
he
went
on
and
argued
that
if
the
board
was
to
get
a
broad
order
by
consent,
there
must
appear
in
the
stipulation
some
facts
showing
that
there
had
been
a
generalized
scheme
to
violate
the
act.
and
the
final
part
of
the
opinion
develops
his
reasons
for
thinking
that
this
would
not
interfere
with
the
board's
handling
of
cases
by
consent
without
a
content.
we
then
brought
the
case
here,
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit
conflicts
with
decisions
in
the
second,
sixth
and
district
of
columbia
circuits.
it
is
supported
by
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
brandman
iron
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
three,
one
of
each
type.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
the
only
one
in
which
the
writ
has
been
granted.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
others
are
simply
pending
our
petition
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
others
are
not
consent
cases.
in
addition,
there
is
still
one
other
case
from
the
seventh
circuit
here
before
this
court,
the
brandman
iron
case
which
was
a
consent
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
supports
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
was
no
--
there
was
opinion
of
any
length
in
the
brandman
iron
case.
the
court
indicated,
i
think
two
things
which
it
might
be
important
to
point
out.
it
again
said
it
relied
on
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
stone
in
the
cheney
case
for
saying
that
the
court
has
a
special
responsibility
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
the
decree.
then
it
says
that
if
it
entered
a
broader
decree,
there
would
--
might
be
a
problem
on
contempt
if
the
--
it
was
an
effort
later
to
punish
the
union
for
conduct
not
in
relation
to
the
parties
to
the
litigation
before
the
board.
it
seems
to
that,
i
may
say,
that
one
of
the
fundamental
errors
that
the
seventh
circuit,
the
first
circuit
appeared
to
have
committed
is
in
thinking
of
these
cases
before
the
board
as
if
they
were
contest
between
the
private
parties,
the
charging
party
and
the
respondent
whereas
of
course
what
the
board
is
concerned
with
is
preventing
the
renewal
of
the
unfair
practices
on
a
broader
scale
and
in
the
public
interest
and
not
simply
to
protect
private
individuals
involved.
our
position
in
this
case
is
very
simple.
we
believe
that
the
court
below
erred
in
undertaking
to
modify
an
order
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
which
was
unquestionably
within
its
jurisdiction
both
as
to
the
subject
matter
and
the
extent
of
the
order
and
which
was
entered
by
consent.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
didn't
mean
quite
that.
i
meant
two
things,
one
that
it
was
--
this
was
a
case
plainly
within
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
a
case
within
the
board's
jurisdiction.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
affected
interstate
commerce
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
employer
and
employee.
i
meant
second
that
this
is
the
type
of
relief
which
the
board
has
the
power
to
grant,
that
is
to
say
if
it
made
on
order
here
directing
the
employer
to
pay
a
fine
of
$50,000,
the
board
has
no
power
to
grant
that
type
of
relief.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
--
i
would
think
--
let
me
add
--
i
think
i'm
going
to
hand
to
you.
first,
i
think
it
should
be
recognized
that
the
complaints
issued
by
the
board
have
never
made
any
specific
request
with
respect
to
relief.
so
on
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
this
--
in
this
case
without
attempting
to
go
beyond
it,
this
is
certainly
an
appropriate
type
of
order
for
the
kind
of
offense
that
the
board
--
that
the
complaint
alleged.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
--
the
complaints
did
not
allege
in
anyway
that
this
employer
or
this
union
had
engaged
in
this
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice
on
other
occasions.
neither
did
it
specifically
charge
that
it
was
a
fair
inference
from
the
unfair
labor
practice
in
which
they
have
engaged
in
the
past,
that
they
might
engage
in
the
same
or
related
unfair
labor
practices
in
the
future.
it
just
set
forth
what
they
had
done.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
correct.
there's
no
--
i
don't
believe
there's
any
question
about
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
nor
do
i
understand
that
judge
aldrich
would
have
disputed
that,
also
he
doesn't
say
anything
one
way
or
another.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
had
been
no
--
there
had
been
no
possibility
here
of
the
respondent
objecting
to
evidence
tending
to
show
that
the
maintenance
of
this
hiring
hall
was
a
general
thing
in
order
to
get
a
broader
order.
i'm
sure
that
--
that
kind
of
proof
has
been
introduced
frequently
under
this
kind
of
complaint.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
nothing
in
this
complaint
would
have
restricted
the
board's
proof
in
such
a
way
that
the
record
it
might
have
made
could
not
have
supported
this
argument.
is
that
it?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
it
works
in
a
--
it
doesn't
quite
work
in
a
board
consent
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
have
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
--
with
that
test.
indeed,
let
me
state
in
a
sentence
and
i
will
come
to
it
a
little
better.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
indeed
would
argue
that
the
test
set
forth
in
the
express
company
case
was
a
proper
test
that
the
question
is
whether,
if
you
have
a
record,
that
the
question
is
whether
the
conduct
which
the
record
establishes
may
reasonably
be
thought
to
give
rise
to
a
fair
as
justice
stone
said
that
the
things
which
are
forbidden
would
otherwise
be
committed
in
the
future.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
except
that
you
would
always
have
--
you
would
always
have
this
question,
what
you
mean
by
an
episodic
incident.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
think
--
and
i'm
not
trying
to
quarrel
with
you,
but
i
think
that's
a
very
important
and
this
is
again,
one
of
the
quarrels
that
i
would
have
with
judge
aldrich,
that
i
think
it's
a
grave
mistake
to
reduce
this
to
a
matter
of
words
and
that
one
unfair
labor
practice
may
reasonably
give
rise
to
an
inference
with
respect
to
the
respondent's
future
conduct.
it
would
be
quite
different
from
the
inference
you
might
draw
about
another
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
archibald
cox
you're
thinking
of
the
sentence
that
limits
the
reviewing
court?
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
really
jumped
over
that
and
that
was
one
thing
that
concern
me
a
little
because
i
had
been
discussing
this
with
you
as
if
the
point
had
been
raised
below
and
i
want
to
make
it
very
clearly
of
course
that
the
fundamental
problem
here
is
that
the
point
never
was
raised
to
the
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
was
about
to
call
the
court's
attention
going
back
to
the
thread
of
my
argument
to
section
10
(e)
of
the
statute
because
our
first
primary
argument
here
is
that
section
--
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
in
plain
violation
of
section
10
(e)
as
already
interpreted
by
this
court.
section
10
(e)
is
printed
on
page
26
of
our
brief.
the
critical
sentence
is
at
the
end
of
that
big
paragraph
on
26.
no
objection
that
has
not
been
urged
before
the
board,
its
member,
agent
or
agency
shall
be
considered
by
the
court
unless
the
failure
or
neglect
to
urge
such
objection
shall
be
excused,
because
of
extraordinary
circumstances.
now
in
our
view,
the
reviewing
court
has
no
--
it's
improper
for
the
reviewing
court
where
the
objection
has
not
been
raised
before
the
administrative
agency
to
apply
what
justice
frankfurter
called
justice
stone's
test,
that
is
to
say
one
never
comes
to
the
question
unless
the
point
has
been
saved
by
the
respondent
below.
and
for
that
proposition,
we
rely
first
on
the
words
in
the
statute,
but
second,
on
the
square
holding
of
this
court
in
the
cheney
california
lumber
case,
where
the
court
held,
i
think,
without
any
doubt,
that
it
involved
an
objection
to
the
scope
of
the
order,
that
a
court
of
appeals
had
no
authority
to
cut
down
an
order
as
too
broad
regardless
of
the
record
where
the
objection
had
not
been
raised
in
the
lower
court.
in
that
case,
the
objection
to
the
scope
of
the
order
did
not
relate
to
the
inclusion
or
any
other
employer.
it
related
to
the
type
or
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice
committed,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
possible
differentiation
between
the
two
cases
in
that
respect.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
would
--
cheney
as
i
understand
it,
saved
the
case
where
the
order
went
clear
outside
the
board's
power.
it
spoke
metaphorically,
traveled
wholly
outside
its
orbit.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
take
it
that
that
was
a
way
of
saying
that
where
the
board
did
something,
we
would
say
was
ultra
vires,
if
it
was
in
the
case
of
an
officer
or
a
private
corporation,
that
if,
as
i
said
earlier,
it
entered
an
order
requiring
the
payment
of
the
penalty,
or
if
it
ordered
the
employer
to
do
something
in
relation
to
employees
who
couldn't
be
covered
by
the
act
because
they
were
supervisors
or
executives,
if
it
did
something
of
that
kind
so
that
the
order
was
of
nullity
because
of
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true,
but
if
the
board
goes
outside
its
jurisdiction,
but
i
think
if
the
objection
has
not
been
raised
below,
and
the
order
is
within
the
board's
jurisdiction,
i
would
--
what
it
called
a
whistle
post,
but
i
think
under
the
statute,
it
has
an
obligation
to
enforce
the
order.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
--
that's
quite
true,
and
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i'd
like
--
mr.
archibald
cox
correct
and
that
--
and
the
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
of
course
depend
upon
one's
general
knowledge
of
the
area
and
backdrop
and
this
court
has
held,
i
think
not
in
board
cases
but
in
federal
trade
commission
cases,
that
that
board's
generalized
knowledge
in
special
experience
are
something
that
may
be
taken
into
account
in
drawing
this
kind
of
interest.
and
i
think
that's
another
mistake
with
respect
to
judge
aldrich
that
he
made,
that
he
says
in
the
course
of
this
opinion,
the
board's
expertise
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
he's
not
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
let
me
--
let
me
proceed
in
this
manner.
may
i
say
just
a
word
more
about
the
cheney
case
and
about
judge
aldrich's
handling
of
it
and
then
i
would
like
to
come
to
the
point
that
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
that
the
permissible
order
depends
upon
the
facts
and
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice
involved
and
to
develop
that
a
little.
and
in
the
course
of
doing
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
will
give
the
court
what
information
i
have
about
the
board's
practice,
and
i
think
that
will
cover
all
the
points.
i
think
that
i
should
in
fairness
call
attention
to
what
judge
aldrich
said
about
the
cheney
case.
he
said
that
the
cheney
case
could
not
properly
be
cited
for
the
proposition,
that
in
the
absence
of
timely
objection
by
the
respondent,
the
court
must
enforce
any
order
propounded
by
this
board.
in
our
opinion,
the
case
stands
for
no
such
proposition.
the
court
there
was
careful
to
point
out
that
findings
of
record
disclosed
the
course
of
conduct
against
which
such
order
maybe
the
only
proper
remedy.
it
was
equally
careful
to
point
out
that
the
situation
would
be
different
if
the
board
had
patently
traveled
outside
the
orbit
of
its
authority,
but
i
have
spoken
to
the
second
point.
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
i
can
only
say
that
i
think
judge
aldrich
badly
misreads
the
opinion
in
the
cheney
case.
the
passage
to
which
he
refers
as
i
read
it
is
one
in
which
justice
frankfurter
will
say
that
the
scope
of
an
order
depended
on
what
the
record
revealed
with
respect
to
the
court's
conduct.
he
was
making
a
general
statement
and
that
in
the
next
sentence
he
goes
on
to
say
that
where
the
point
has
not
been
raised
below,
the
court
will
not
examine
the
particular
record
to
see
whether
it
does
support
the
order
that
was
made.
it
should
also
be
remembered
that
in
the
cheney
case,
a
(inaudible)
disagreed
with
the
rest
of
the
court.
he
did
urge
that
the
court
had
an
obligation
to
go
to
the
particular
record
and
if
there
were
any
doubt
on
the
words,
i
think
the
fact
that
he
was
in
disagreement
with
his
colleagues
would
show
that
they
were
laying
down
a
rule
that
was
improper
to
go
to
the
particular
record,
if
the
board
stays
within
its
jurisdiction,
within
its
power.
now
of
course
the
reason
for
the
rule
is
quite
clear
and
seems
to
me
all
together
sound.
the
fact
is
that
the
scope
of
relief
depends
upon
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
particular
facts
and
circumstances,
and
this
is
something
in
which
one
leaves
the
--
trier
of
the
facts
should
have
an
opportunity
to
develop
them
and
the
courts
are
benefited
by
the
experience
and
analysis
of
the
expert
agency.
let
me
take
just
a
minute
to
illustrate
this
point
in
connection
with
the
types
of
cases
here
before
the
court.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
as
a
matter
of
really
widespread
knowledge
without
needing
any
special
experience
that
an
employer
who
engages
in
discriminatory
discharges,
another
coercion
when
a
union
comes
to
organize
his
plant
for
the
first
time
heretofore
an
organized
plant,
one
can
infer
that
his
opposition
is
to
union
organization.
it
would
not
normally
be
to
organization
by
this
particular
union.
now,
i
agree
that
it
could
be.
there
may
be
situations
where
an
employer
has
had
some
experience
with
the
leaders
of
a
particular
local.
he
may
feel
that
some
of
the
employers
of
the
textile
industry
did
but
they
didn't
carefully
were
organized,
that
they
weren't
going
to
have
clarity
in
this
(inaudible),
but
ordinarily,
we
know
from
experience
that
if
the
union
--
if
an
employer
tries
to
deter
union
organization,
the
first
time
organizers
come
to
this
shop,
it's
the
union
he's
to
get
and
therefore,
it's
proper
to
protect
the
employees
through
an
order
not
to
protect
the
organizational
activities
of
this
particular
union,
but
which
protects
them
in
engaging
in
organizational
activities
on
the
part
of
any
union.
now
with
other
unfair
labor
practices,
the
situation
may
be
quite
different.
the
communications
worker's
case
which
was
before
this
court,
seems
to
me
to
be
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
situation
where
one
could
not
infer
that
because
of
a
particular
violation
related
to
a
particular
employer
there
was
a
likelihood
of
our
generalized
violations.
this
was
a
case
of
violence
by
the
local
union
of
growing
out
of
the
strike
against
the
telephone
company.
the
local
union
admitted
members
as
members
only
the
employees
of
the
particular
employer.
it
dealt
only
with
one
employer.
what
is
more,
it's
i
think
the
matter
of
certainly
common
knowledge
among
those
in
the
field
that
the
outbreak
of
violence
during
a
strike
is
very
likely
to
be
the
product
of
a
particular
environment,
and
the
fact
that
relations
in
one
area
have
reached
the
point
where
violation
--
where
violence
breaks
out,
is
not
evidence
that
relations
between
that
international
union
and
the
at&t
all
over
the
country
have
reached
that
point.
the
international
union
was
named
as
the
respondent,
but
its
connection
with
its
violence
was
very
remote,
and
to
have
put
it
under
the
impediment
of
such
an
order
all
over
the
country,
in
quite
different
circumstances,
would
have
been
a
very
severe
remedy
indeed.
so
i
would
say
in
that
case,
you
see
that
the
inference
that
--
it's
quite
different
from
the
inference
one
would
draw
in
relation
to
employer
unfair
labor
practice.
now
it
said
in
the
--
in
a
sentence,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
the
case
of
a
secondary
boycott,
if
the
union
there,
in
order
to
reach
the
general
contractor
on
a
construction
project,
engages
in
secondary
activities
against
the
employees
of
one
of
the
subcontractors,
it's
a
pretty
fair
inference
that
he
has
in
particular
about
which
secondary
employer
he
has
picked
out,
and
that
if
he's
willing
to
engage
in
the
secondary
boycott
in
order
to
get
the
general
contractor
against
the
electrical
contractor,
well
the
next
time
he
may
do
it
against
the
plumbing
contractor,
like
i
thought
spotting
the
case
with
pick
pockets.
it's
not
particular
whose
pocket
he
picks
and
if
he
picks
my
pocket
what
you
want
is
to
keep
him
picking
any
pockets
in
the
future
and
not
just
not
to
pick
my
pocket
again
and
i
think
this
is
very
similar.
now
in
this
case,
we
don't
know
what
the
facts
were,
but
it
certainly
is
very
reasonable
to
suppose,
that
this
belongs
in
the
type
of
category
that
i
illustrated
by
the
employer
unfair
labor
practice.
in
the
first
place,
this
case
involves
apparently
maintenance
of
an
illegal
hiring
hall,
and
certainly
was
of
an
illegal
system
for
hiring.
and
when
--
i
think
i
can
say
never,
but
a
union
certainly,
very
seldom
maintains
a
hiring
hall
for
a
particular
employer.
it's
the
nature
of
the
institution
that
more
than
one
employer
will
be
involved.
furthermore,
the
ila
council
of
local
unions
was
involved
here,
and
it's
not
at
all
unreasonable
to
suppose
where
this
unlawful
arrangement
had
existed
for
10
years,
that
this
was
a
policy
of
the
council.
and
that
they
hadn't
just
singled
ochoa
out
as
the
employer
with
whom
they
would
attempt
to
establish
a
closed
shop
and
illegal
hiring
hall,
that
they
were
applying
it
to
other
employers
on
the
waterfront
in
puerto
rico.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
circuit
had
evidence
before
it,
not
evidence
in
the
record,
but
indications
before
it
that
that
was
the
case
because
as
i
pointed
out,
there
were
two
cases
in
this
category
before
the
court,
among
the
seven
the
union
dissolved
the
doris
case
as
well
as
this
one.
that
was
the
same
counsel
of
longshoreman's
union.
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
was
again
the
closed
shop
and
hiring
hall,
so
this
was
at
least
an
indication
that
the
suppositions
i'm
making
are
not
unreasonable.
now
in
a
consent
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
those
facts
might
well
have
existed,
certainly
the
board
did
not
travel
outside
its
property
in
entering
the
form
of
orders
to
which
the
employer
had
consented
and
we
think
that
these
reasons,
the
court
please,
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed.
i
forgot
to
answer
justice
frankfurter,
if
i
may
go
on
for
just
a
minute.
the
board
--
i
have
to
break
this
down
a
little
bit
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
my
understanding
is
that
the
board
in
the
case
of
employer
unfair
labor
practices
has
normally
enjoined
--
ordered
the
employer
to
cease-and-desist
from
discouraging
membership
not
only
in
the
particular
union,
but
in
any
other
union
on
the
theory
i
presume
that
i
stated
earlier.
in
the
case
of
secondary
boycotts
--
mr.
archibald
cox
communications
workers
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
--
that
case
has
--
i
think
it
has
a
no
bearing
on
the
employer
unfair
labor
practice,
for
the
reasons
i've
tried
to
state
earlier
that
one
must
read
the
case
in
the
light
of
the
realities
of
life
and
not
the
words
of
the
order.
and
as
i
tried
to
suggest,
the
reality
is
that
violence
in
a
strength
is
not
an
indication
that
there
will
be
violence
by
all
over
the
country
if
any
strike
against
any
employer
by
the
same
international
union,
and
that
is
why
it
was
cut
down,
not
just
because
of
the
words.
now,
the
case
has
had
an
impact
upon
the
board.
for
example,
in
this
situation
in
the
ochoa
case,
the
practice
was
that
if
nothing
was
made
of
the
point,
the
board
in
a
contested
case
and
the
regional
office
in
a
consent
case,
would
usually
issue
an
order
like
this
one.
since
the
decision
--
before
the
communications
workers
case,
if
the
point
was
raised,
either
with
the
regional
director
or
before
the
board,
and
it
would
then
inquire
whether
in
the
specific
facts
there
was
evidence
that
the
union
would
attempt
to
maintain
the
unlawful
closed
shop
with
a
number
of
employers
or
whether
this
was
an
isolated
incident.
but
the
normal
inference
was
this
was
the
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice
that
usually
isn't
confined
to
the
union's
relations
as
one
employer.
since
the
decision
in
the
communications
workers
case,
the
board
has
--
when
it
just
handled
it
as
a
matter
of
routine,
entered
the
narrower
form
of
order,
and
has
reserved
the
broad
one
for
situations
where
there
was
some
affirmative
proof
that
the
union
had
done
or
was
likely
to
do
this
in
relation
to
other
employers.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
what
i
would
say
if
i
was
presenting
it
to
the
board.
mr.
archibald
cox
before
a
court
i
would
simply
say
that
this
is
a
reasonable
inference.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
in
this
--
this
i'm
afraid
sounds
like
as
if
i
was
simply
arguing
but
it
isn't.
i
think
one
and
a
very
large
part
of
the
reason
is,
that
until
the
communications
workers
case,
i
don't
think
anyone
ever
suggested
that
there
was
any
question
so
far
as
the
employer
unfair
labor
practice
went,
so
far
as
that
situation
went
that
the
broad
order
was
normally
the
proper
one.
in
other
words,
the
question
never
was
raised.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
--
judges
are
also
bound
by
the
rule
in
section
10
(e).
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
quite
agree
with
that
and
i
wouldn't
have
to
be
there
if
they'd
be
here
if
they
have
been
and
no
doubt
as
a
result
of
these
cases
even
though
they
reverse
we
hope,
they
will
address
themselves
more
to
this.
i
should
say
one
more
word.
in
saying
that
this
has
not
been
discussed
and
the
board
has
not
set
forth
its
reasoning
in
the
employer
unfair
labor
practice
case,
i
do
not
want
to
give
the
impression
that
the
court
has
not
set
forth
its
reasoning
in
a
large
number
of
related
cases.
it
certainly
has
set
forth
its
reasoning
when
the
question
was
raised,
but
the
question
was,
“how
broad
should
the
order
be
in
relation
to
the
types
of
conduct?”
it
has
also
set
forth
its
reasoning
in
numerous
cases,
about
before
and
after
the
communications
workers
case,
where
it
was
dealing
with
union
unfair
labor
practices,
for
example
the
secondary
boycott
case.
it
has
considered
and
explained
why
it
thought
that
it
was
largely
irrelevant
who
happened
to
be
the
secondary
employer,
who
was
caught
in
the
squeeze
in
the
press.
this
was
a
weapon,
a
way
of
getting
the
primary
employer,
and
therefore
it
was
likely
to
be
invoked
against
one
secondary
employer
from
another.
so
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
that
the
board
had
never
directed
itself
to
this
problem
because
it
hasn't
done
it
--
in
the
employer
interference
with
union
organization
case.
now,
i
would
agree,
your
honor
that
it
could
have
done
much
more
in
this
direction.
i
think
that
there
is
a
growing
realization
to
that
among
some
of
the
agencies
as
well
as
the
board
and
i
would
join
with
you
and
hoping
that
it
would
go
further.
that
concludes
my
argument
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice.
