justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
you
may
have
told
us
but
i
missed
it
if
you
did.
how
many
of
the
seven
cases
that
judge
aldrich
took
under
review
are
now
before
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
of
each
type.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
the
others
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
others
are
not
consent
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
in
conflict
and
supports
this
--
support
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
by
that
that
it
was
an
order
allowably,
permissively
made
within
the
confines
of
a
complaint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
generally
speaking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
complaint
--
has
the
complaint
any
relevance
to
this
problem
mainly
the
scope
of
grievances,
of
violations
set
forth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
not
saying
a
complaint
like
a
bill
in
equity
setting
forth
the
prayer
but
the
outlines
of
what
it
is
that
is
charged
again
--
it
charges
violations
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
the
breath
of
relief.
is
it
--
this
really
raises
what
you're
indicating
that
--
what
the
function
of
the
complaint
is
and
extent
to
which
it
must
be
recognized,
it
presents
issues,
board
determinations
and
therefore
for
board
remedies.
i
know
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
under
that
complaint,
if
it
had
become
as
it
has
not
become
an
adversary
proceedings
under
that
complaint,
it
could
be
developed
that
this
wasn't
the
first
incident,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
if
--
if
the
evidentially
material
recorded
the
breadth
of
order,
the
complaint
would
not
have
restricted
it.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yeah,
but
it
bears
on
the
general
question
of
what
the
record,
quote
“the
record”
is
or
isn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
in
fact
my
question,
mr.
solicitor,
is
the
application,
if
it'd
be
a
relevant
test
of
chief
justice
stone's
underlying
thought
that
certainly
a
court,
since
after
all
we're
reviewing
here
that
which
amounts
to
an
injunction
by
the
court
that
the
reviewing
body,
the
court
and
this
court,
is
justified
in
--
in
not
granting
a
greater,
a
broader
or
pervasive
review
than
it
would
grant
on
this
record,
whatever
it
maybe,
if
this
came
up
from
a
bill
in
equity
and
relief
granted
by
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
--
therefore
the
stone
test,
if
i
may
call
it
that,
is
an
illusory
one
in
a
way,
that
you
can't
say
if
this
had
been
a
suit
in
equity
on
this
complaint,
no
such
relief
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
saying
it
does,
all
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i've
got
to
find
out
the
reach
of
that
test
given
in
the
express
company
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
if
the
record
--
if
it
had
been
or
where
there
is
an
adversary
proceeding
and
the
record
is
barren
of
any
suggestion
that
what
he's
complained
of
is
otherwise
an
isolated
or
episodic
incidents
then
you
will
get
the
application
of
his
test,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
trying
to
anticipate
your
argument,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
dissociate,
i
don't
think
you
can
take
the
equity
test,
the
court
reviewing
an
equity
decree
test
that
unmindful
of
a
policy
behind
and
the
reasons
for
whatever
--
is
attorney
that
i'm
about,
attorney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
you
can
--
this
is
a
dangerous
analogy
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you've
got
an
administrative
body
with
its
scope
of
discretion
and
the
specific
restriction
of
congress
upon
the
reviewing
part
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
don't
let
me
dislocate
your
arguments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
you
indicated
a
little
earlier,
so
many
of
or
good
many
or
perhaps
in
this
case,
the
legitimacy
of
the
order,
the
propriety
of
the
order
depends
on
allowable
inferences
to
be
drawn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
turns
in
so
many
instances
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
almost
in
--
in
this
kind
of
case
almost
always.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
deal
with
his
statement
that
the
board
has
a
tendency
in
making
needlessly,
from
his
point
of
view
needlessly
broad
order?
have
you
got
any
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
before
you
move
on
to
this,
what's
the
bearing
of
--
that
our
case
would
have
been
362
communications
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
bearing
of
that
on
what
you
say
has
been
the
normal
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
to
the
employer,
what
you
said
in
effect
--
what
you
--
what
you
have
said
in
effect
is
that
if
an
employer
resists
unionization,
violence,
taking
violence
out
of
the
context
of
the
discussion,
if
an
employer
resists
union
organization
because
he's
opposed
to
unionization,
what
you've
said
if
i
followed
you
is
that
one
can
draw,
one
should,
indeed
one
should
draw
the
appropriate
inference
if
the
discloses
a
bent
of
mind
and
not
an
ad
hoc
attitude.
is
that
essence
of
it?
i
don't
know
how
you
phrase
it
but
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
now
what
i
want
to
put
to
you
is
this,
not
only
as
hearing
for
the
board
here
but
in
view
of
your
own
specialized
experience
in
these
things,
has
the
board,
and
if
it
happens
why
it
doesn't,
set
forth
that
as
a
result
of
our
experience,
we've
been
sitting
here
all
these
years
with
an
accumulation
of
experience,
and
we
now
generalize
it
and
say
that
is
what
this
mass
of
cases
over
the
decades
has
shown,
that
when
there
is
opposition
to
unionization
not
based
on
any
particular
reasons
that
the
union
is
--
is
affiliated
with
this
or
that
undesirable
party,
that
is
our
experience
that
a
specific
case
manifests
a
general
attitude
of
mind.
why
did
the
board
make
--
make
those
declarations
with
appropriate
persuasiveness
so
that
the
courts
wouldn't
have
to
merely
yield
to
guesswork
on
the
part
of
counsel
who
represent
them
that
that's
what's
in
their
mind?
why
don't
they
put
their
minds
on
paper?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that
the
judges
are
naïve
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
i
know
but
it's
the
way
they
apply
it.
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
you.
i'm
agreeing
with
you,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
administrative
agencies
could
be
a
little
more
articulate
in
the
right
places.
