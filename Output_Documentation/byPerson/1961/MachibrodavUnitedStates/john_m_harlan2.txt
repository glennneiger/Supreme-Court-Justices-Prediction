oh,
i
suppose
an
understandable
thing
the
united
states
attorney
is
--
of
this
is
one
that
has
something
on
the
file,
isn't
it?
whether
the
court
pays
any
attention
to
it
or
not,
that's
a
human
natural
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
suppose
your
position
doesn't
go
to
the
extreme
of
saying
that
no
matter
what
a
prisoner
alleges
if
it
creates
an
issue
of
facts,
he
is
automatically
entitled
to
a
hearing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
the
district
court
will
try
this
case
that
these
papers
before
him
acted
--
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
an
excess
of
what
he
should've
done
in
denying
this
application
about
the
hearing.
that's
the
essence
of
this,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
discretionary
is
not
a
happy
word
but
at
least
you
got
to
show
something
more,
don't
you
to
make
a
due
process
claim
merely
that
the
papers
on
their
face
raise
a
trivial
issue
of
fact?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
time
in
the
rule,
mr.
reitz
between
the
plea,
the
sentencing
and
this
2255
motion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
motion
was
made
when?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
explanation
to
the
delay
that
the
record
indicates?
