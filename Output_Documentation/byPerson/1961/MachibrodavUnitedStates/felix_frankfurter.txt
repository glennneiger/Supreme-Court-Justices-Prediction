and
then
this
motion,

when
it
was
filed,
it
was
disposed
off
by
judge

on
september

more
than
three
years.
what
were
the
--
was
there
any
intervening
steps
between
that
sentence
and
this
motion?

two
counsels

be
his
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did

have
any
counsels
--
did
he
had
counsel
--

there
anything
to
disclose
--
to
show
that
he
wasn't
aware
of
these
facts
that
he
now
set
forth?
or
that
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
no
--
no
proceeding
was
started
on
the
basis
of
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
explanation
of
why
it
was
delayed?
justice
felix
frankfurter

don't
have
to
get
legal
education
regarding
the
facts
that
are
--
within
your
own
--
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
think
it?
he
doesn't
appear
to
have
been
a
--
very
slow
with
that
person
or
unfamiliar
with
the
nature
of
the
problem,
does
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean,
the
nature

the
same
charges?
justice

three
items
or
episodes
in
relation
to
these
subsequent,
these
present
claims.
what
would
judge
kloeb
get
out
of
those
three
experiences
with
the
petitioner
as
bearing
on
what
he
now
alleges?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
that
of
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
gets
some
judgment
regarding
the
prisoner's
--
petitioner's
intelligence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
capacity
to
apprehend,
his
strength
of
character,
and
things
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
cooper,
you
mean
schumann
&
mccullar
(ph)
or
some
other
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
schumann
&
mccullar
(ph).
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
counsels
of
his
choice.
justice
felix
frankfurter

retained
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
evidently
ceased
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
65?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
were
--
ms.
cooper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
this
went
to
a
hearing,
who
were
the
potential
witnesses?
who
would
be
--
could've
been
the
potential
witnesses?
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
the
petitioner,
who
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
--
the
only
other
material
with
the
court
that
the
judgment
gets
in
regard
to
this
charge
is
to
get
the
same
--
to
get
the
statement
of
the
u.s.
attorney
and
the
petitioner
respectively
under
oath
and
subject
to
possible
and
all
the
power
and
process
of
cross-examination
which
would
break
down
to
a
week.
do
you
say
the
u.s.
attorney
would
under
cross-examination
be
crushed
to
corroborate
all
of
the
statements
that
this
fellow
says,
is
that
it?
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
translating
in
to
what
would
happen
into
actuality
instead
of
just
abstract
speculation
and
fanciful
taking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
--
who?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
affidavits
from
former
counsel
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
judge
did.
