number
69,
john
machibroda,
petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
reitz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
in
the
answer
to
--
wouldn't
the
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
depends
somewhat
very
greatly
on
whether
the
things
alleged
in
the
petition,
were
things
within
the
knowledge
of
the
trial
judge
or
things
that
were
extraneous
to
the
actual
court
rule
conduct
of
the
parties.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
wasn't
your
situation
as
i
understand
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
cooper.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
were
the
proceedings
that
you've
mentioned
ms.
cooper,
just
what
were
the
proceedings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
--
you
may
not
--
an
arraignment
i
suppose
of
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
ms.
cooper
also
though
there
might
be
some
other
witnesses
in
connection
with
the
letters
that
the
man
said
he
wrote
to
the
attorney
general
and
to
the
judge
for
instance
of
the
--
if
he
said
he
gave
them
to
the
warden
in
the
prison
and
they
were
lost
some
place
in
transit
and
they
developed
that
he
did
actually
do
it.
i
suppose
there
might
be
witnesses
to
test
the
truth
of
this
statement
in
that
regard
might
there
not
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that
he
wouldn't
have
to
and
that's
evidentiary,
isn't
it?
if
you
are
trying
to
speculate
now,
on
what
witnesses
he
could
have
on
--
to
substantiate
his
claims
and
i
don't
suppose
he
has
to
name
everyone
in
this
petition,
does
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
the
judge
knew
nothing
about
this
man.
it
was
an
entirely
new
proceeding
to
him.
and
this
petition
was
on
file
and
was
before
it.
would
it
be
adequate
to
call
for
a
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
just
say
it's
a
new
judge
and
everything
else
is
the
same
and
he
makes
his
--
files
his
petition,
would
that
--
to
be
sufficient
to
call
for
a
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
wondering
how
could
the
record
show
anything
about
these
letters.
and
how
could
the
record
itself
show
to
a
stranger,
maybe
to
the
judge
at
the
trial,
it
might
be
a
little
different
but
to
a
strange
judge,
how
could
this
show
whether
his
allegation
about
his
conversations
with
the
unites
states
attorney
and
the
promises
that
were
made
were
true
or
false?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
the
extent
to
deny
him
a
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
isn't
a
question
whether
it's
a
harder
case,
that
wasn't
your
--
would
he
be
entitled
to
--
would
the
judge
be
entitled
to
say
in
most
circumstances,
on
the
records,
files
and
documents
shown
conclusively
that
he's
not
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
is
denied
or
would
he
be
obliged
to
give
him
a
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i've
talked
about
these
files
and
these
records
but
to
another
judge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
there
are
no
records.
there
are
--
i
want
the
records
just
they
are
now.
there
are
no
letters
there
because
he
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
oh,
yes.
that
letter
be
in
there
too.
but
the
two
letters
that
he
says
he
sent
and
the
judge
says
i
don't
remember
receiving.
now,
we
got
a
strange
judge.
this
one
determined
that
question
was
--
as
he
will,
the
question
as
to
whether
the
allegation
about
the
coerced
plea
is
true.
would
that
be
something
calling
for
a
hearing
or
for
the
judge
just
to
decide
whatever,
this
man
is
convicted
on
this
admitted
certain
things
and
so
we
won't
give
preference
to
anything.
he
says,
we
won't
give
him
the
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
don't
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
ms.
cooper
i
don't
want
to
be
persistent
but
i'll
tell
you
just
why
i
asked
that,
i
wonder
if
this
man
is
being
denied
a
hearing
in
this
case
just
because
the
judge
says
i've
had
experiences
with
this
man.
i
know
he's
a
robber
and
i
know
he's
a
thief.
he's
lied
in
other
respects
and
therefore
i
think
that
nothing
he
says
would
justify
him
and
in
taking
the
time
of
this
court
in
giving
him
a
hearing
so
i
will
deny
it.
is
that
what
the
--
is
that
what
the
judge
did
in
this
case
or
with
another
judge,
complete
stranger
have
the
evidence
on
which
he
could
say
that
the
man
--
this
petition
was
frivolous
and
that
there
was
no
need
of
giving
him
a
hearing.
that's
the
reason
that
i'm
asking
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
reitz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
reitz
you
mean
if
not
a
thief,
just
one
is
a
case
where
you're
representing
him
here.
all
he'd
get
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
you'd
get
would
be
a
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
all
you
seek
here
is
a
hearing,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we'll
recess.
