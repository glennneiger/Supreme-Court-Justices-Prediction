mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
if
the
court
please.
petitioner
in
this
case
is
also
seeking
collateral
relief
from
conviction
in
sentence,
in
this
case
for
two
bank
robberies.
the
convictions
rest
upon
pleas
of
guilty
entered
on
february
24th,
1956
in
the
record
at
page
40,
sentence
was
imposed
on
may
23rd,
1956.
the
sentence
is
aggregating
on
four
accounts
for
the
two
bank
robberies
40
years.
this
is
on
the
record
at
page
42
and
43.
this
present
proceeding
was
instituted
on
february
9th,
1959
as
a
motion
to
vacate
sentences
under
section
2255
of
judicial
code.
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio
summarily
denied
the
motion
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
in
a
brief
per
curiam
opinion.
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
may
i
say
at
the
outset
is
identical
to
the
issue
in
hill
versus
united
states.
it's
argued
namely
a
violation
of
federal
criminal
rule
32
(a).
i
don't
think
there's
any
necessity
for
me
to
say
more
on
that
rule
beyond
this.
what
is
at
stake
in
this
rule
is
nothing
less
than
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
be
heard
and
there's
nothing
more
fundamental
to
our
concept
with
due
process
and
the
right
for
a
defendant
to
be
heard.
in
the
context
of
the
sentencing
hearing,
rule
32
(a)
imposes
on
the
judge
the
obligation
to
make
that
right
effective.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
his
counsel
was
asked
to
speak
and
did
not
your
honor.
he
declined
to
say
anything.
it
was
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
the
rule
32
(a)
to
the
extent
that
it
operates
determined
by
this
court
in
the
green
case
operates
to
provide
the
defendant
himself
personally,
not
to
this
counsel,
personally
the
right
to
speak
and
this
court
virtually
unanimous
to
mr.
justice
stewart
only
accepting
took
that
position
in
the
green
case.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that's
right.
and
what
i
say
with
respect
to
rule
32
(a)
is
the
same
as
i
would
say
under
rule
11th
or
rule
44.
these
do
not
restate
constitutional
rights.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
that
i
know
of
that
could
be
stated
in
terms
of
an
obligation
on
the
court
to
initiate
some
proceeding.
what
the
rules
do
is
they
extend
and
make
more
effective
that
underlying
constitutional
rights
by
imposing
on
the
judge,
not
the
defendant
and
not
his
lawyer
the
obligation
to
undertake
to
vindicate.
the
second
issue
in
this
case
is
far
more
important.
may
i
say
mr.
justice
whittaker
before
it
pass
it,
that
the
government,
mrs.
cooper
has
indicated
concedes
that
32
(a)
has
violated
in
this
case
as
well.
a
more
fundamental
question
raised
by
petitioner,
machibroda
however
concerns
the
validity
of
its
underlying
conviction.
as
i've
indicatively
these
were
obtained
based
upon
guilty
pleas
and
by
his
motion
under
section
2255,
petitioner
contends
that
his
pleas
were
wrongfully
induced
by
promises
made
by
the
prosecutor,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
that
this
was
further
compounded
by
a
failure
of
the
judge
to
comply
with
a
mandatory
requirements
of
rule
11
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
i
stress
at
the
outset
that
there
was
no
hearing
in
this
case.
the
united
states
filed
a
response,
until
the
response
was
attached
an
affidavit
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
was
charged
with
having
--
made
the
bargain
with
the
prisoner
but
there
has
been
as
yet
no
hearing.
and
the
only
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
prisoner
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
these
very
serious
allegations.
since
there
was
no
hearing,
i
believe
the
government
concedes
that
the
allegations
must
be
assumed
to
be
true
for
purposes
of
this
proceeding
unless,
in
the
words
of
a
statute
which
is
on
the
top
of
page
4
of
petitioner's
brief,
unless
the
motion
and
the
files
and
records
of
the
case,
conclusively
show
that
the
prisoner
is
entitled
to
no
relief,
the
court
shall
cause
notice
thereof
to
be
served
upon
the
united
states
attorney,
grant
a
prompt
hearing
thereon,
determine
the
issues
and
make
findings
of
fact
in
conclusions
of
law
with
respect
thereto.
the
court
below
has
determined
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
the
files
and
records
of
this
case
conclusively
show
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
no
relief
and
this
position
the
government
supports
in
this
court.
the
motion
is
found
in
the
record
beginning
on
page
13,
and
there
is
of
course
the
most
crucial
document
in
the
case.
the
most
pertinent
allegations
concerning
the
bargain
are
on
pages
14
and
15.
in
sum,
without
reading
this
now,
the
petitioner
alleges
that
there
were
three
relevant
conversations
between
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
himself.
the
first
occurred
in
the
county
jail
where
he
was
being
detained
on
or
about
february
21st,
1956
which
was
three
days
before
his
arraignment.
the
prosecutor
promised
petitioner
that
if
he
entered
pleas
of
guilty,
he
would
receive
a
total
sentence
of
20
years.
the
promise
was
set
to
be
made
with
the
authority
of
the
united
states
attorney
and
was
implied
to
be
agreeable
to
the
judge.
it
was
a
bargain
that
was
virtually
ironclad.
further,
petitioner
was
expressly
cautioned
not
to
tell
his
lawyer
of
the
bargain.
the
lawyer
was
taken
out
of
the
arrangements.
the
second
conversations
took
place
in
the
county
jail
on
may
22nd,
1956
which
was
the
day
before
sentencing.
at
that
time,
the
prosecutor
reported
the
petitioner
that
the
judge
was
“vexed”,
because
petitioner
had
testified
in
behalf
of
a
codefendant
who
had
stood
trial
in
these
proceedings.
the
prosecutor
indicated
there
might
be
some
trouble
with
respect
to
the
agreement
that
the
sentence
was
not
to
exceed
a
total
of
20
years.
when
petitioner
protested
that
he
was
going
to
bring
the
whole
thing
to
the
attention
of
the
judge
in
open
court,
the
prosecutor
replied
there's
nothing
to
worry
about.
if
the
court
imposes
more
than
a
20
year
sentence,
the
united
states
attorney
would
move
to
have
a
sentence
reduced
within
60
days,
an
authorized
procedure
and
the
petitioner
was
further
told
threateningly
that
if
he
“insisted
on
making
a
scene”
his
difficulty
would
be
compounded
with
further
charges.
third
conversation
took
place
immediately
after
sentence
had
been
announced
on
may
23rd.
again,
the
prosecutor
promised
that
as
soon
as
the
judge
“cooled
off”,
the
united
states
attorney
would
have
a
sentence
reduced
to
20
years
and
the
prisoner
was
taken
off
to
begin
to
serve
his
sentence.
the
motion
further
alleges
that
subsequent
to
his
incarceration,
he
sent
two
letters
to
the
judge
and
two
letters
to
the
attorney
general
protesting
against
the
failure
of
the
government
and
the
court
to
keep
the
bargain.
he
received
no
reply
to
either
of
these
letters.
now
this
is
in
general
the
substance
of
the
allegations
of
the
motion.
what
has
happened
in
effect
is
that
the
government
and
the
court
below
has
tried
this
motion
virtually
received
evidence,
in
fact,
received
evidence
without
having
allowed
the
prisoner
even
the
basic
rights
of
a
hearing.
the
government
concedes,
i
believe
it's
a
concession.
it's
hard
to
read
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
files
and
records
of
this
case
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
motion
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner.
and
this
is
--
it
is
in
itself
deemed
i
suppose
his
basic
rights.
he
is
pictured
as
a
prisoner
who
had
deliberately
concocted
a
story,
tailor-made
so-called
to
fit
the
facts
of
this
case
and
explain
any
apparent
inconsistencies
by
some
facts
not
in
the
record.
this
voice
of
the
prisoner
makes
him
i
suppose,
a
psychopathic
liar
who
cannot
be
believed,
no
matter
what
he
says
even
though
i
take
that
the
government
concedes
there's
not
a
single
fact
in
the
record
which
tends
to
contradict
the
story
of
the
bargain
as
he
alleges.
what
does
appear
in
the
first
instance
is
the
affidavit
as
i
mentioned
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
this
was
filed
as
an
appendix
or
in
appended
to,
the
response
of
united
states
and
is
relied
upon
heavily
by
the
government
in
their
brief
and
--
in
their
brief
and
this
court.
i
cannot
find
one
single
justifiable
reason
for
that
affidavit
to
be
in
this
case.
it
is
nothing
more
or
less
an
attempt
to
try
the
case
without
having
a
hearing.
if
as
the
government
must
do,
they
conceived
the
facts
as
alleged
by
the
motion
for
purposes
of
summary
disposition,
the
affidavit
is
at
no
point,
the
government
says
the
affidavit
is
here
simply
to
show
that
the
government
does
not
agree
with
the
fact
alleged
in
the
motion
which
would
be
perfectly
obvious
without
the
affidavit.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
from
mr.
condon's
standpoint,
i
can
understand
that.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
court
using
it,
referring
to
it
in
the
opinion
and
arguing
to
this
court
i
don't
see
the
relevance.
i
see
no
relevance
at
all.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
well,
the
government
says
and
they're
technically
quite
accurate
that
the
court
below
did
not
specifically
rely
on
it.
however,
in
this
opinion
of
the
court
which
appears
on
the
record
on
the
beginning
on
page
47th,
the
court
does
have
a
sentence
which
is
unusual
for
a
simple
passing
reference
on
page
49,
the
three
quarters
of
the
way
down
under
oath,
clarence
m.
condon,
former
assistant
united
states
attorney
empathically
denied
these
allegations.
that's
a
stronger
statement
that
i
would
expect
from
a
simple
recitation
of
fact
but
there
is
nothing
in
here
to
indicate
that
the
court
expressly
relied
upon
that
affidavit,
that's
true.
now
the
second
piece
of
evidence
that
is
in
here,
it's
nothing
more
or
less
than
testimony
of
the
district
court.
the
judge
says
on
the
bottom
of
page
49,
in
reference
to
the
letters
which
the
prisoner
said
he
sent
from
prison
protesting
the
breach
of
faith
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
in
court,
the
judge
says
this
court
did
not
receive
two
letters
from
the
defendant.
that
is
nothing
more
or
less
in
the
statement
by
a
witness.
as
justice
frankfurter
said
in
the
gibson
case,
human
memory
is
a
very
treacherous
thing
and
that's
particularly
true
when
you
don't
recall
something
having
happened.
the
judge
has
dismissed
these
allegations
as
to
protests
filed
contemporaneous
with
the
man's
entering
into
prison
by
saying,
“i
don't
remember
receiving
them.”
now,
even
if
it's
true
that
the
judge
did
not
receive
the
letters
even
that
would
not
prove
that
the
letters
had
not
been
sent.
the
prisoner
alleges
that
they
were
posted.
he
cannot
of
course
allege
that
they
were
received.
whether
they
ever
got
to
the
courthouse,
whether
they
were
handled
by
members
of
the
clerk
staff
and
the
court
no
one
really
knows
at
this
point.
there's
been
no
hearing
on
the
allegations.
now
the
second
bit
of
evidence
which
the
court
does
formerly
use
is
a
letter
allegedly
received
by
the
court
some
six
months
after
the
prisoner
got
to
prison.
in
this
letter,
the
prisoner
in
a
very
neat
tone
asked
for
clemency.
now
the
court
on
page
40
--
on
page
50,
describes
this
as
evidence
which
indeed
it
is.
there
has
been
no
showing
that
this
letter
is
authentic.
there
has
been
no
introduction
of
this
letter
into
the
files
and
workers
of
this
case.
it's
simply
a
letter,
a
private
letter
sent
by
a
prisoner
to
a
judge.
the
letter
was
bad
enough
but
the
inference
from
which
the
judge
draws
from
this
letter
is
even
worse.
the
judge
says
that
the
inference
from
this
letter
shows
the
defendant's
allegations
must
be
false
because
he's
asking
for
clemency
rather
than
protesting
the
breach
of
faith.
this
inference
i
submit
the
defendant
is
entitled
under
all
element
reconceptions
of
due
process
to
rebut.
the
prisoner
recall
has
allege
that
he
sent
two
letters
protesting
a
breach
of
faith
from
the
part
of
the
court
shortly
after
being
imprisoned.
it
is
not
certainly
unreasonable
to
say
that
a
prisoner
who
has
twice
tried
to
assert
his
rights
and
found
assertion
futile
might
try
an
alternative
route.
so
that
even
if
this
letter
is
authentic,
the
prisoner
is
entitled
to
argue
to
the
court
that
the
inference
which
the
judge
has
drawn
and
from
which
he
says
so
conclusively
disproves
the
facts,
is
in
fact
not
founded
in
fact.
but
the
prisoner
seeking
clemency
was
doing
nothing
more
or
less
than
seeking
an
alternative
route.
the
government
as
i
say
in
their
brief
page
41
has
put
great
stress
on
the
lack
of
collaboration
by
the
facts
alleged
by
the
defendant.
even
on
this
meager
record
however
there
is
fairly
ample
corroboration
of
what
happened.
in
the
first
place,
the
united
states
attorney's
affidavit
and
here,
i
suppose
serves
some
cross
purpose.
the
united
states
attorney's
affidavit
admits
interviewing
the
prisoner
in
the
county
jail,
denies
that
it
was
done
for
this
purpose
and
denies
that
it
was
done
on
the
dates
alleged.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
sir,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
would
not
describe
it
as
a
discretionary
matter.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
sir.
statutes
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
oh,
i
think
that
would
make
a
great
differences,
if
he
alleged
facts
that
had
occurred
in
court.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
he
would
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
sir.
these
are
the
--
all
the
basic
facts
took
place
in
private
conversations
with
no
corroboration
outside
of
court.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
sir
your
honor.
the
proceeding
--
at
sentencing
is
in
the
record
on
page
40
and
it's
very
brief.
it's
about
the
lower
half
of
the
page
on
both
bank
robberies,
the
court
asked,
how
do
you
plead?
the
counsel
said,
guilty.
the
court
said,
is
that
your
desire
mr.
machibroda?
mr.
machibroda
said,
“yes
your
honor.”
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
this
is
a
major
disagreement
between
the
government
and
petitioner
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
on
the
facts
as
they
stand,
the
government
cites
this
among
many
other
irrelevant
facts
as
indicating
that
there
was
no
bargain.
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
transcript
which
would
be
consistent
or
more
consistent
with
the
bargain
than
this
one.
if
a
prisoner
has
agreed
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty,
and
the
judge
asks
him,
“do
you
want
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty?”
he's
likely
to
say
yes,
if
he's
going
through
with
the
agreement.
what
the
court
should
have
done
and
did
not
do
and
this
is
the
violation
of
rule
11
which
petitioner
has
alleged
is
he
should
have
made
more
than
this
simple
perfunctory
inquiry
to
determine
what
it
was
that
motivated
the
defendant
to
plead
guilty,
to
have
explored
the
nature
of
the
crime
with
him,
to
have
explored
why
it
was
that
he
was
entering
that
plea,
a
simple
routine
perfunctory
question
like
this
cannot
conceivably
satisfy
rule
11,
and
this
court
i
think
has
squarely
so
held
in
the
shelton
case,
where
in
fact
the
government
confessed
error.
in
the
shelton
case
more
than
a
simple
question
like
this
and
the
judge
to
the
prisoner,
they
had
a
formal
proceeding
with
the
prisoner
signing
the
guilty
plea
in
open
court.
you
couldn't
find
a
more
willing
expression
of
a
guilty
plea
than
there
was
in
the
shelton
case.
and
yet
the
government
when
the
case
reached
this
court,
confessed
error,
said
there
had
been
a
violation
of
rule
11
and
there
was
also
in
the
background
of
that
case
an
alleged
bargain
but
it
was
a
combination
of
the
bargain
plus
the
violation
of
rule
11
which
was
relied
upon
by
the
solicitor
general
in
asking
this
court
to
reverse
and
this
court
summarily
did
reverse
that
case.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
shelton
case
established
a
rule
which
seems
highly
oscillatory
in
these
circumstances
in
connection
with
rule
11
that
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
rule
and
there
were
allegations
of
a
bargain
or
some
defect
in
the
plea,
the
burden
of
proof
shifts
to
the
government
to
show
that
the
plea
was
in
fact
voluntary.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
the
argument
of
this
case
to
adopt
that
rule
but
it
indicates
what
follows
or
what
could
conceivably
follow
from
the
failure
of
the
court
to
make
the
mandatory
inquiry
required
by
rule
11.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
sentencing
took
place
in
may
1956.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
motion
was
made
in
1959.
it's
not
quite
three
years,
february
1959,
it's
a
little
shy
of
three
years.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
explanation
beyond
the
facts
that
we
know
that
the
prisoner
at
the
outset
on
the
allegations
that
i
say,
we
have
to
accept
as
true
protested
four
letters,
two
to
the
court
and
two
to
the
attorney
general
which
--
to
which
he
received
no
response.
thereafter,
he
tried
to
obtain
clemency
and
thereafter
there
is
this
gap
of
time.
the
only
explanation
for
which
i
could
offer
and
i'm
simply
guessing
is
that
he
was
in
the
process
of
obtaining
a
legal
education.
up
until
that
time
he
obviously
did
not
have
much
knowledge
of
law
but
this
is
the
first
attempt
by
this
prisoner
at
post
conviction
relief
formerly.
i
started
to
say
that
the
affidavit
of
the
united
states
attorney
is
in
itself
some
corroboration.
there
is
further
corroboration
in
the
transcript
to
what
took
place
the
first
time
the
defendant
appeared
in
court.
this
is
on
page
37
and
the
proceeding
was
on
february
17th,
1956
in
which
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
informed
the
court
that
in
all
probability
a
plea
of
not
guilty
would
be
entered.
this
was
four
days
prior
to
the
first
conversation
with
the
united
states
attorney.
subsequently
of
course,
the
guilty
plea
was
in
fact
entered.
the
third
elementary
--
fairly
elementary
corroborating
fact
is
in
what
the
codefendant
did
in
this
exact
case,
when
marvin
ferris
breaton
indicted
for
the
same
bank
robbery
did
in
fact
plead
not
guilty,
went
to
trial
and
was
convicted.
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
and
the
petitioner
would
not
have
taken
the
same
road.
our
third
bit
of
evidence
which
the
--
which
has
come
in
to
this
case
more
or
less
by
the
back
door
is
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
at
this
trial,
of
his
codefendant.
he
testified
in
behalf
of
the
codefendant.
the
government
now
argues
that
this
testimony
further
shows
that
he
is
a
person
with
no
fund
or
credibility
left
and
indeed
they
now
make
the
rather
unusual
move
of
offering
to
this
court
for
the
first
time
anywhere
a
transcript
of
that
testimony,
this
offer
is
on
their
brief
in
page
10.
in
a
footnote,
they
say
that
they
have
the
testimony
transcribed
and
they're
now
offering
it
to
the
court
for
the
court's
use.
i
suggest
that
would
be
an
intolerable
abuse
of
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
a
hearing,
to
conduct
the
hearing
on
the
conference
chambers
of
this
court.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
don't
know
that
was
--
i
don't
know
that
that
was
what
he
testified
your
honor.
the
court
indicates,
the
same
judge
who
sentenced
this
prisoner
sat
at
the
trial
of
the
codefendant,
in
his
opinion
of
the
bottom
of
page
48
and
the
top
of
49,
he
says
the
test
--
the
defendant
testified
in
behalf
of
mr.
breaton
which
to
the
best
to
this
court's
recollection
more
testimony
was
that
the
defendant
had
admitted
the
robbery
of
the
bank.
the
defendant
was
accompanied
by
another
individual
and
not
by
the
codefendant
breaton.
and
the
judge
says
obviously,
the
jury
did
not
accept
the
defendant's
account
on
the
bank
robbery
who
returned
the
verdict
of
guilty
against
breaton.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no,
the
motion
alleges
that
the
judge
was
vexed
because
of
his
testimony
unfavorable
to
the
government.
was
unfavorable
in
the
sense
that
it
exonerated
that
defendant
and
that's
all
the
motion
says.
the
additional
facts
are
brought
in
by
the
judge
out
of
his
recollection.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
sir.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
only
thing
the
record
shows
your
honor
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
i
can
use
the
word
record.
the
motion
alleges
that
the
prisoner
sought
informally
by
writing
to
the
district
judge
and
to
the
attorney
general
to
seek
or
to
get
some
relief
from
the
failure
or
the
breach
of
faith
from
the
part
of
prosecutor
and
the
court.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
your
honor.
he
was
not
represented
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
not
to
my
knowledge
and
the
motion
was
filed
pro
se.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no,
he
--
in
fact
the
motion
specifically
alleges
that
he
was
aware
of
the
facts
and
protested
immediately
upon
arriving
in
jail.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
formal
legal
proceeding.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
explanation
in
the
record.
i
venture
the
hypothesis
which
is
not
of
course
in
the
record
that
he
was
obtaining
a
legal
education.
this
is
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no,
but
the
remedy
that
you
might
seek
is
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
don't
know
that
it
appears
your
honor.
the
only
documents
that
he
has
filed
himself
for
the
--
are
the
motion
in
this
case
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
oh,
the
bank
robbery?
yes
your
honor,
undoubtedly.
the
--
i
would
add
just
one
more
thing.
the
government
has
stressed
in
its
brief
what
it
seems
to
me
are
a
lot
of
irrelevant
facts.
virtually
the
opening
and
closing
statement
in
their
brief
concerns
the
fact
that
this
defendant
--
petitioner
voluntarily
surrendered
to
the
jurisdiction.
he
was
captured
in
canada
i
believe.
way
of
extradition
came
back,
how
this
fact
and
many
others
like
it
which
the
government
stresses
have
any
relevance
whatsoever
to
whether
or
not
a
bargained
guilty
plea
was
entered
escapes
me
particularly
since
on
this
fact
especially.
the
alleged
bargain
did
not
come
into
existence
until
the
prisoner
had
come
under
the
jurisdiction.
i
see
no
indication
in
the
fact
that
a
man
waives
indictment
that
he
is
therefore
going
to
waive
a
trial
and
plead
guilty.
the
two
don't
go
together
at
all
in
my
mind
nor
does
the
fact
that
the
court
explained
the
charges
whether
the
charges
were
read
to
them
or
the
fact
that
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
pointed
out
in
the
record,
he
indicated
an
open
court
that
it
was
his
desire
to
plead
guilty.
these
facts
are
totally
consistent
but
the
bargaining
of
guilty
plea
which
is
exactly
what
the
prisoner
alleges
in
this
case
and
on
which
petitioner
submits
he
is
entitle
to
a
hearing.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
may
i
just
add
one
more
word
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
i
have
about
a
minute
left.
in
connection
with
the
hearing
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
were
conducting
the
hearing
or
assert
additional
witnesses
that
i
would
call
immediately
that
the
primary
one,
namely
defense
counsel.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
defense
counsel
to
find
out
why
it
was
in
a
brief
span
of
days.
the
defendant
had
indicated
normal
accord,
when
he
pled
not
guilty
to
change
his
mind.
another
witness
that
i
would
look
for
myself
in
this
hearing
on
these
allegations
which
i
think
would
be
crucial
would
be
a
record
of
visits
to
the
county
jail.
it
was
assumed
to
me
that
there
would
probably
be
some
record
kept
of
the
--
those
who
visit
prisoners
and
if
this
corroborating
evidence
could
be
found
it
would
be
most
helpful
i
would
think
in
establishing
the
accuracy
of
the
statements
made
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
your
honor.
the
only
thing
in
the
case
as
the
start
--
it
was
in
petitioner's
per
se
motion
and
his
affidavit
attached
filed
from
alcatraz
where
he's
somewhat
incapacitated.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
sir.
we'd
be
back
at
the
arraignment
stage
on
this
issue.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
to
my
knowledge
here
your
honor
there's
nothing
in
the
record
affirmatively
denying
it
or
admitting
it.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
we'd
get
the
hearing
and
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
thought
mr.
justice
black
might
be
one
of
the
hearing.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that's
right.
mr.
justice
clark,
the
testimony
is
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
i
do
not
know
what
he
testified
other
than
the
allegation
that
it
was
unfavorable
to
the
government.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
would
think
that's
further
testimony
by
the
district
judge.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
it's
in
his
memorandum,
yes
your
honor.
