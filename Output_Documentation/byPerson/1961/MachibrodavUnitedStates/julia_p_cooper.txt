ms.
julia
p.
cooper
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
pinpointed
the
remaining
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
whether
on
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
mr.
machibroda
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
his
allegation
that
the
pleas
of
guilty
were
induced.
now
in
denying
the
motion,
judge
kloeb
who
was
the
judge
who
had
heard
the
pleas
of
the
guilty
in
the
first
instance.
judge
kloeb
looked
at
the
files
and
the
records
of
the
case.
he
looked
at
the
allegations
of
the
motion
and
he
decided
that
petitioner's
pleas
were
entered
voluntarily
and
with
understanding
and
that
the
allegation
of
a
bargain
in
light
of
the
files
and
records
had
to
be
false.
now,
let
us
look
at
what
judge
kloeb
had
before
him,
not
only
in
the
files
and
records
but
of
his
own
personal
knowledge.
the
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
was
before
judge
kloeb
on
four
occasions
over
a
three-month
period
between
february
and
march
of
1956
to
answer
to
these
bank
robbery
charges.
he
had
a
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
oh,
yes.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
as
far
as
the
district
judge's
conservation
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
oh,
yes,
i'm
--
oh
--
before
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes,
i'm
coming
to
that.
on
the
first
occasion,
at
the
first
appearance,
the
petitioner
waives
a
prosecution
by
indictment
to
a
first
series
of
bank
robbery
charges.
on
the
second
occasion,
he
waived
prosecution
by
indictment
to
the
second
series
of
bank
robbery
charges
and
at
that
time
he
entered
the
pleas
of
guilty
to
both
of
the
information
which
have
been
filed
against
him.
on
the
third
occasion
he
testified
against
the
government
and
in
the
trial
of
a
codefendant.
and
i
might
say
that
they
--
the
government
does
not
rely
on
specific
testimony
in
this
regard,
rely
on
it
only
to
the
extent
that
the
court
did
and
it's
--
it
appears
as
part
of
the
record
in
the
court's
memorandum.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes.
and
if
that
--
he
admit
the
guilt.
i
think
that's
properly
in
the
record.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
well,
personal
observation
--
the
judge's
own
personal
observations
of
the
petitioner's
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
--
conduct
and
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
--
assurances.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
that
is
true.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes.
now,
we
think
that
the
record
shows
that
judge
kloeb
did
take
precautions
to
ensure
that
the
petitioner
understood
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him.
he
was
given
copies
of
the
information
and
both
of
the
informations
were
read
word
for
word
and
in
open
court.
judge
kloeb
received
the
assurance
of
counsel
and
this
was
retained
counsel,
that
he
had
examined
the
charges
carefully
and
had
discussed
them
with
its
client.
and
i
might
say
that
counsel
appeared
with
petitioner
on
each
of
the
four
occasions.
he
was
--
and
with
him
even
upon
the
occasion
of
his
appearance
as
a
witness.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes,
schumann
&
mccullar
(ph).
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
i
think
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes.
as
far
as
--
he
was
determined,
yes
your
honor.
now,
as
mr.
reitz
has
pointed
out,
the
court
heard
the
assurance
of
the
petitioner
that
it
was
his
desire
to
waive
indictment
into
the
pleas
of
guilty.
in
this
instance,
it
was
asked
if
that's
your
desire
mr.
machibroda.
is
that
your
desire?
now,
the
record
also
shows
that
the
petitioner
was
26
years
old
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
and
judge
kloeb
personal
assessment
of
the
petitioner
at
the
time
of
sentencing
is
important
we
think
or
is
at
least
significant
insofar
as
it
has
a
bearing
on
petitioner's
later
conduct
and
credibility
at
the
time
of
imposing
the
40
year
sentence.
judge
kloeb
said
that
in
view
of
the
seriousness
and
the
extent
of
the
crimes
which
involved
some
a
$159,000
and
aggravated
circumstances
of
bank
robbery
including
the
use
of
the
gun
that
it
was
his
feeling,
that
is
the
feeling
of
the
court
that
petitioner
needed
to
--
that
rather
society
needed
protection
from
petitioner
until,
he
reached
a
age
of
50
or
60
years.
now
the
record
shows
that
petitioner
also
wrote
to
judge
kloeb,
six
months
after
sentencing
and
we
think
this
letter
is
properly
a
part
of
the
files
certainly
in
the
records
of
the
case.
this
letter
is
important
and
that
judge
kloeb
in
describing
it
as
the
only
letter
he
had
ever
received
from
petitioner
relied
upon
it
as
a
great
extent,
to
a
great
extent
as
we
think
he
had
a
right
to
do
in
deciding
that
petitioner's
allegations
of
a
bargain
--
that
these
allegations
were
not
credible.
this
letter
appears
at
pages
55
to
56
of
the
record.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
50
--
55
and
56
of
the
record,
number
69.
it
is
apparent
we
think
that
this
is
not
the
letter
of
an
angry
young
man
who
had
been
misled
but
rather
the
letter
of
a
contrite
man
who
is
sorry
for
his
transgressions
against
society
and
for
judge
kloeb's
assessment
of
him
which
led
to
the
imposition
of
the
40
year
sentence.
you
will
notice
that
at
--
on
page
55
he
says,
“i
am
advised
by
the
decisions
arrived
at.”
at
the
top
of
page
56,
he
says,
"my
feeling
is
that
you've
--
he
shows
to
give
me
this
sentence",
and
i
quote
here
"because
of
my
abducere
and
foolish
pride."
all
you
could
see
was
a
young
maniac
with
no
apparent
respect
for
authority
and
so
he
thought
i
was
immutable.
and
notice
that
he
expressed
his
remorse.
i
have
a
great
desire
to
again
be
accepted
by
our
society.
notice
that
he
expresses
at
that
time
respect
for
the
law.
i
believe
that
our
law
today
represents
not
only
but
authority
but
justice,
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word.
and
notice
he
also
expressed
his
respect
for
judge
kloeb.
you
being
a
federal
judge
and
a
man
of
intelligence,
integrity
and
humility.
note
--
finally,
the
relief
that
he
request,
i
urge
you
to
reconsider
my
case
in
the
hope
that
you
would
consider
making
my
two
sentences
concurrent
which
would've
resulted
in
a
25
year
sentence,
had
the
sentences
been
concurrent.
now
this
then
is
the
record.
on
the
other
hand,
we
might
consider
the
allegations
which
petitioner
made
in
his
motion
to
vacate
which
was
--
that
the
motion
was
filed
three
years,
almost
three
years
thereafter.
in
his
affidavit
which
appears
at
pages
20
and
23
of
the
record
and
to
which
the
court's
attention
had
previously
been
called.
he
alleged
not
only
that
he
entered
the
plea
in
1956
because
mr.
condon
promised
him
that
if
he
would
do
so,
he
would
receive
a
sentence
not
exceeding
20
years.
but
he
also
implied
that
the
court
had
knowledge
of
this
agreement.
now
this
is
of
course
is
the
same
court
that
petitioner
had
praised
six
months
after
the
inquisition
of
the
60-year
sentence
as
a
man
of
integrity,
intelligence
and
humility.
now,
petitioner
also
alleged
in
his
motion
that
he
had
written
two
letters
to
the
court
informing
of
their
agreement.
yet
the
only
letter
which
judge
kloeb
had
received
is
that
letter
which
we
have
already
seen
which
was
a
letter
of
an
entirely
different
character.
and
petitioner
further
alleged
that
mr.
condon
promised
him
that
in
the
event
the
sentence
exceeded
the
promised
20
years,
that
he
would
move
--
mr.
condon
would
move
within
60
days
thereafter
for
reduction
of
that
part
of
the
sentence
which
exceeded
the
20
years.
and
yet
petitioner
waited
after
this
time
almost
three
years
before
instituting
the
present
proceeding.
under
these
circumstances
it
is
understandable
that
judge
kloeb
found
petitioner's
allegations
to
be
false.
and
significantly
judge
kloeb
stated
in
his
comprehensive
memorandum
which
appears
at
pages
47
to
52
of
the
record
that
if
he
had
any
doubt
at
all
about
the
truth
or
the
falsity
of
the
allegations,
he
would've
required
a
hearing
but
that
he
could
draw
no
other
conclusion,
no
other
conclusion
from
the
record
but
that
petitioner's
allegations
were
mere
concocted
--
or
afterthoughts.
petitioner's
position
would
appear
to
be
that
no
matter
how
ludicrous
or
how
patently
false
our
allegations
are
in
the
light
of
the
record,
is
a
movement
under
section
2255
does
in
fact
set
out
details
of
an
alleged
agreement.
an
alleged
injustice
within
his
personal
knowledge,
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing.
we
do
not
believe
this
to
be
the
law.
the
often
repeated
generalization
that
averments
of
fact
under
section
2255
motion
must
be
accepted
as
true
means
only
that
they
must
be
accepted
as
true
insofar
as
they
are
not
conclusively
shown
to
be
false
by
the
files
and
records.
this
is
the
language
we
think,
the
specific
language
of
section
2255
and
it
is
the
holding
of
the
hayman
case
which
petitioner
relied
upon
initially
in
bringing
the
motion
in
his
brief.
in
the
hayman
case,
the
issue
was
whether
the
movement's
attorney
had
appeared
as
a
counsel
for
a
witness
with
the
movement's
knowledge
and
consent.
that
particular
issue
was
in
no
way
reflected
in
the
files
and
records
of
that
case.
and
the
government
in
hayman
had
conceded,
in
fact
conceded
that
the
factual
issue
required
the
presence
of
hayman
at
a
hearing.
the
court
in
hayman,
this
court
in
hayman
specifically
pointed
out
that
a
movement
under
section
2255
does
not
have
to
be
automatically
produced
in
every
proceeding
but
that
his
production
depends
upon
the
circumstances
of
each
case.
the
court
recognized
that
section
2255
permits
summary
dismissal
if
--
in
the
language
of
--
as
i've
said,
the
language
of
the
section
said
that
the
motion
has
been
filed
and
the
records
in
the
case
conclusively
show
that
the
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
relief.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes
sir,
it
was,
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor,
no.
our
case
is
very
similar
to
the
present
case
is
that
of
johnson
versus
the
united
states.
likewise
the
case
which
arose
in
the
sixth
circuit
--
in
the
johnson
case,
may
i
make
just
one
reference
to
that.
the
johnson
case
at
239
f.2d
698
was
a
bank
robbery
case
as
this
case,
there
was
a
40-year
sentence
as
in
this
case.
the
motion
under
section
2255
was
filed
seven
years
after
conviction
and
it
relied
on
hayman
and
as
in
this
case
it
alleged
that
through
coercion
and
threats
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
johnson
was
denied
essential
witnesses.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
in
referring
the
denial
of
the
motion
without
a
hearing
noted
that
the
allocations
followed
a
pattern
which
had
become
prevalent
to
enable
convicts
under
long
term
sentences
to
obtain
vacation,
vacations
from
imprisonment
by
trumped
up
charges
against
their
attorneys,
against
court
officials
and
even
district
judges
notwithstanding
that
said
--
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
lower
courts
to
follow
the
pronouncements
of
the
supreme
court.
but
said
the
court
and
we
quote
this
on
page
42
of
our
brief.
we
cannot
believe
that
the
supreme
court
intended
in
its
care
case
for
the
protection
of
human
liberty
to
impose
upon
the
inferior
courts
the
duty
of
recalling
years
after
action
in
criminal
cases
prisoners
for
rehearing
based
on
obviously
nebulous
and
false
accusations.
that
reasoning
is
pertinent
here.
we
think
the
very
purpose
of
a
hearing
is
to
enable
a
court
a
court
to
arrive
at
the
truth.
the
very
purpose
of
section
2255
was
to
prevent
useless
burdensome
hearings
where
the
record
would
show
that
the
claims
moved
out
the
merit.
and
as
our
brief
points
out
the
other
futility
of
the
hearing
is
particularly
apparent
here
where
the
allegations
themselves
ruled
out
the
possibility
that
they
should
be
corroborated.
finally,
one
word
about
our
petition
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes.,
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
as
far
as
the
allegations
would
allege
they
would
be
the
only
witnesses.
the
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
--
petitioners
does
not
in
a
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
judge,
yes.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes
your
honor.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
he
specifically
alleges
that
the
names
of
those
witnesses
in
his
affidavit
is
there
might
be
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
i
don't
say
that
he
has
to
name
the
--
no
your
honor
but
the
--
he
has
to
provide
details
to
the
extent
that
it
would
make
his
motion
meet
the
requirements
of
the
section
that
the
--
the
allegations
must
be
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
on
the
same
records,
your
honor?
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
on
the
same
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
well,
your
honor
that
might
be
a
harder
case
than
this
but
we
think
that
the
record
itself
in
this
case
is
the
presumption
of
regularity
quite
apart
from
the
personal
knowledge
of
the
judge.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
he
alleged
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
as
i've
said
your
honor
that
would
be
a
harder
case.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
i
think
your
honor
that
each
case
would
have
to
be
considered
on
the
basis
of
the
files
and
in
records.
if
this
is
an
individual
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
to
another
judge,
it's
presumably
the
letter
to
the
judge
is
a
part
of
the
files
and
records.
that's
right.
the
letter
to
judge
kloeb
is
a
part
of
the
thousand
records
in
your
hypothetical
case,
is
that
right?
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
there
is
one
letter
there.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
well,
your
honor
i
certainly
think
the
strange
judge
would
have
to
take
into
consideration
everything
within
the
files
and
record
and/or
as
to
whether
or
not
in
that
case,
particular
case,
he
would
be
required
to
grant
him
a
hearing.
i
mean,
i
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
is
so
important.
he
will
have
an
intelligent
accused,
represented
by
two
counsel.
all
of
those
circumstances.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
well,
no
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
that
was
the
attitude
of
the
judge
here
nor
do
i
think
that
the
record
would
indicate
that
that
was
his
consideration.
that
is,
i
mean,
i
don't
think
he
said
that
i
know
he's
thief.
in
fact,
just
the
opposite,
i
would
say
that
certainly
judge
kloeb
had
a
rather
--
well
he
was
impressed
by
the
letter
asking
for
leniency
which
the
young
man
did
send
to
him.
i
think
he
took
into
consider
and
i
think
his
memorandum,
reading
his
memorandum
would
show
that
he
took
it
to
consideration
the
totality
of
these
circumstances.
the
fact
he
--
there
was
a
three
months
period
of
doing
--
in
which
time
he
answered
to
the
charges.
the
fact
that
he
was
represented
by
diligent
counsel.
the
fact
that
--
he
did
appear
to
be
intelligent.
that
the
record
itself
showed
a
presumption
of
regularity.
i
think
all
of
these
considerations
would
appear
in
his
opinion.
thank
very
much.
