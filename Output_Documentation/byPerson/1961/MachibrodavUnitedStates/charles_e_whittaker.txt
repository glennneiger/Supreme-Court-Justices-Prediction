did
the
court
really
rely

what
significance
do
you
attach
to
the
courts
asking
any

what
else
that
the

should've
done

could've
done?
justice
charles

whittaker
on
the
ground
that
this
plea
was
induced
by
fraud
of
the
assistant
district
attorney
is
irrelevant
you
say
to
show
that
in
the
trial
of
this
codefendant,
he
took
full
responsibility
on
the
stand
for
the
holdup.

whittaker
i
thought
you
were
arguing
though
the
reason
the
court
to
gain
the
total

with
this
defendant
was

he
had
taken
the
stand
in
the
trial
of
the
codefendant
and
assumed
all
of
the
claim
in
an
attempt
to
exonerate
the
codefendant?

whittaker
didn't
you
he
testified
against
the
government?
he
also
testified
against
himself,
did
he?
