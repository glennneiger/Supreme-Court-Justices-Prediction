justice
william
o.
douglas
would
your
objection
go
to
rule
35
(2)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
that
was
--
the
mode
in
green
was
rule
35,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
you're
really
asking
us
to
reconsider
green.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
entertained
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
there
certainly
isn't
anything
in
those
opinions,
any
of
the
three
of
them
or
four
of
them,
i
don't
how
many
they
were,
we
don't
think
this
could
be
raised
only
by
appeal,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
excuse
my
interruption
again
but
i
assume
on
my
recollection
of
green
that
nothing
was
mentioned
about
the
propriety
of
the
use
of
rule
35
procedure
but
i
see
now
in
the
footnote
of
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
that
he
addresses
himself
to
the
propriety
of
rule
35
on
other
aspects
of
this
case.
there
was
one
in
the
green
case
--
there
was
a
complaint
of
an
improper
charge
of
the
jury.
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
properly
said
in
his
footnote
that
rule
35
does
(inaudible)
but
rather
is
limited
to
challenging,
involved
the
legality
of
the
sentence
itself.
it
seems
to
be
not
assuming
arguendo
that
35
--
rule
35
applies,
but
it
seems
to
almost
say
that
35,
rule
35
is
a
proper
position.
that
was
not
an
opinion
for
the
court,
but
it
was
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course
we
have
had
arguments
in
the
court
as
to
whether
rule
35
as
opposed
to
considering
under
2255
where
it's
proper
to
raise
those
things
sua
sponte
i
think.
