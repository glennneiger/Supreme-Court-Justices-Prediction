ms.
julia
p.
cooper
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
agrees
that
in
neither
the
case
of
the
petitioner
here
nor
in
the
companion
case
of
the
petitioner
(inaudible)
have
there
been
compliance
with
rule
32
(a)
as
this
court
has
interpreted
that
rule
in
green.
we
say
however
that
the
error
is
not
one
properly
before
the
court
on
collateral
attack.
now
at
the
outset,
may
i
again
pinpoint
the
error
with
which
we
are
concerned?
as
noted
in
the
green
case,
the
right
embodied
in
rule
32
(a)
had
its
beginning
in
the
old
english
law,
practice
of
allocution,
arising
at
a
time
when
a
person
accused
of
a
felony
was
not
permitted
to
have
counsel
to
represent
him
and
there
was
a
formal
inquiry
was
put
to
him,
do
you
john
jones
have
any
reason
to
say
as
to
why
sentence
should
not
be
pronounced
against
you
and
in
answer
to
that,
the
person
accused
of
the
felony
could
answer
not
only
to
matters
and
arrest
the
judgment
but
also
as
to
a
plea
in
mitigation.
now
the
issue
in
green
was
whether
this
formal
inquiry
was
mandatory
in
light
of
present
day
procedure.
the
government
argued
in
that
case
that
it
was
not,
although
it
might
be
the
better
practice.
this
court
rejected
the
contention
of
the
government
that
inquiry
to
counsel
met
the
requirements
of
the
rule
since
it
said
the
need
still
existed
for
a
person
being
sentenced
to
personally
present
his
plea
in
mitigation.
it
did
not
decide,
we
do
not
think
whether
noncompliance
with
a
literal
concept
of
the
formal
allocution
that
is
the
putting
of
this
formal
inquiry
would
per
se
result
in
an
illegal
sentence.
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
the
omission
of
this
formal
inquiry
by
its
very
nature
is
subject
to
correction
only
by
direct
appeal.
we
say
that
it
is
not
an
error
of
the
scope,
of
the
magnitude,
or
other
character
that
is
subject
to
correction
perhaps
years
after
sentencing
either
by
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
or
by
motion
to
vacate
sentence
under
section
2255
or
by
rule
35
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
now,
i
won't
take
too
much
at
the
outset
about
habeas
corpus.
although
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
impliedly
conceded
that
we
think
that
he
could
not
invoke
the
great
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
since
an
oral
argument
mr.
reitz
relies
primarily
on
rule
35,
i
will
only
say
one
or
two
things
at
the
outset
with
reference
to
the
collateral
attack.
under
either
habeas
corpus
or
under
motion
2255
the
only
error
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes,
we
object
to
them
being
raised
under
all
three.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
that's
right
your
honor.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
no.
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
actually
in
green
this
court
did
not
really
meet
the
question.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes,
entertained
under
rule
35
motion
but
we
understand
the
holding
in
that
case
to
be
that
as
the
record
was
too
ambiguous
to
show
that
the
(inaudible)
concept
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
well,
there
is
an
implication
if
i
might
say
so
your
honor
that
raising
these
questions
years
after
sentencing,
did
present
certain
questions,
certain
difficulties.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
no.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
that
is
right.
the
basic
assumption
was
made.
now,
if
i
may
dispose
of
a
few
basic
questions
as
to
the
collateral
remedy,
i
think
it
can
be
agreed
that
only
those
errors
are
the
most
fundamental
character
are
errors
which
are
so
basic
that
they
can
be
said
to
undermine
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
properly
the
subject
of
collateral
relief.
the
scope
of
collateral
relief
was
comprehensively
discussed
by
this
court
in
sunal
versus
large
and
i
think
that
that
case
is
still
void.
that
case
recited
the
cardinal
principle
that
the
--
that
was
a
habeas
corpus
case
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
would
not
do
service
for
an
appeal
except
in
exceptional
circumstances
or
as
dissenting
members
of
this
court
put
it
in
sunal,
the
writ
will
lie
in
lieu
of
an
appeal
only
to
prevent
a
complete
miscarriage
of
justice.
now,
the
error
with
which
we
are
presently
concerned
is
not
just
that
kind
of
an
error.
it
raises
no
jurisdictional
problem,
thus,
the
facts
show
the
contrast
we
think
with
those
errors
in
sentencing
which
do
raise
jurisdictional
problems,
such
sentences
for
example
as
those
which
exceed
the
maximum
provided
by
statute.
moreover,
the
error
here
is
one
which
is
known
and
is
capable
of
being
raised
on
appeal
and
we
do
not
think
it
presents
those
exceptional
circumstances
as
would
warrant
a
departure
from
the
cardinal
rule
that
the
proper
way
of
correcting
errors
is
by
appeal.
we
do
not
think
it
remotely
approaches
for
example
in
seriousness
the
error
which
was
considered
in
sunal
versus
large.
there
that
was
an
incorrect
trial
ruling
which
deny
to
the
defendant
the
right
to
defend,
a
trial
on
a
certain
basis
which
the
law
later
said
was
available
to
him
but
this
court
nevertheless
said
was
correctable
only
by
direct
appeal
and
we
do
not
think
that
an
argument
for
greater
cognizance
can
be
made
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
under
sunal
versus
large
the
indication
of
collateral
remedy
would
have
called
for
retrial
whereas
here
it
would
call
only
for
re-sentencing.
the
issue
here
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
when
your
honor
--
perhaps
i
should
start
at
this
point
and
tell
you
why
we
think
rule
35
does
not
apply
here.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
your
honor,
we
start
off
with
the
propositions
certainly
that
we
think
as
to
scope,
rule
35
is
narrower
in
this
sense
that
there
were
few
questions
that
should
be
raised
under
it.
the
rule
we
say
is
available
only
to
correct
an
illegal
sentence,
and
what
the
petitioner
hill
is
asking
here
is
not
to
correct
an
illegal
sentence
but
to
have
an
erroneous
submission
in
the
sentencing
procedure
rectified.
we
say
that
an
illegal
sentence
within
the
meaning
of
rule
35
is
one
which
on
its
face
does
not
for
some
reason
conform
to
the
letter
of
the
statute
which
authorized
it
and
we
think
that
the
decisions
and
the
history
of
the
rule
support
this
construction.
for
example,
this
court
we
do
not
think
has
held
to
date
at
its
--
that
rule
35
is
applicable
to
a
sentence
which
is
not
illegal
per
se
on
its
face.
now,
we
might
consider
initially
the
--
quite
apart
from
being
considered,
initially
the
recent
cases
which
had
come
before
this
court
in
which
rule
35
has
been
found
to
applicable.
there
is
the
case
of
heflin
versus
united
states
in
which
the
issue
is
whether
consecutive
sentences
could
be
imposed
on
the
bank
robbery
statute
for
feloniously
receiving
in
taking
the
same
property.
the
court,
this
court
thought
rule
35
was
available
since
the
sentence
imposed
was
“illegal
on
its
face.”
i
might
also
call
your
attention
to
callanan
versus
united
states
to
holiday
versus
johnston
and
to
prince
versus
united
states.
they
were
all
cases
where
this
issue
of
the
pyramiding
of
penalties
was
raised.
in
morgan
versus
united
states,
this
court
noted
that
rule
35
was
not
available
to
correct
a
claim
denying
of
the
right
to
counsel
since
and
the
court
said
sentences
subject
to
correction
under
that
rule
are
those
which
the
judgment
of
conviction
did
not
authorize.
now,
rule
35
promulgated
in
1946
continued
the
existing
law
and
the
law
at
that
time
was
that
a
federal
district
court
could
not
correct
its
judgments
after
term.
now
this
was
a
pronouncement
of
this
court
in
the
early
case
of
united
states
versus
meyer.
now,
the
lower
court
decisions
following
the
meyer
case
held
that
there
were
two
exceptions
or
there
were
several
exceptions
to
this
rule
of
no
alteration
after
term.
these
exceptions
were
that
a
court
could
after
alteration
of
term
correct
for
clerical
mistakes
and
for
illegal
sentences
and
the
illegal
sentence
as
would
appear
from
the
review
of
the
cases
was
a
sentence
which
either
exceeded
the
maximum
provided
by
statute
or
the
sentence
which
imposed
to
sentences
for
the
same
offense.
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
noted
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
heflin,
rule
35
codified
this
existing
law
and
it
was
intended
to
remove
any
doubt
that
a
federal
district
court
could
correct
an
illegal
sentence
after
expiration
of
term.
we
do
not
think
that
the
rule
enlarged
the
scope
of
illegality
as
it
has
been
existent,
and
the
scope
of
legality
we
say
did
not
include
this
type
of
error
with
which
we
are
concerned.
and
may
i
say
in
this
regard
that
this
is
just
not
a
matter
of
--
we
just
can't
stop
and
say
this
is
just
a
matter
of
recalling
a
prisoner
for
re-sentencing.
the
issue
here
is
not
quite
that
simple.
granted
that
the
purpose
of
allocution
is
to
permit
the
prisoner
to
speak,
to
speak
himself
or
i
might
inevidently
put
it,
to
speak
his
piece,
but
we
can't
stop
there.
the
only
purpose
of
speaking
is
to
influence,
or
invoke
the
leniency
of
the
sentencing
judge
and
the
discretionary
manner
of
sentencing,
and
a
court
of
course
does
not
exercise
its
discretion
solely
on
the
basis
of
matters
urged
by
the
defendant.
there
may
be
many
other
considerations.
there
may
be
evidentiary
considerations,
the
seriousness
of
the
crime,
the
aggravated
circumstances
under
which
it
was
committed,
the
prior
record,
the
defendant's
conduct
even
at
the
time
when
he
is
brought
before
the
court.
and
so
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
therefore
that
if
this
court
found
that
allocutions
could
be
raised
collaterally
under
either
of
the
motions
of
rule
35
or
2255
that
whether
prisoner
may
be
recalled
before
a
court
which
did
not
originally
sentence
him
or
where
time
as
though
the
memory
of
the
sentencing
court
that
a
perusal
of
the
entire
record
might
be
necessary.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
here
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
know
if
he
is.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
yes,
he
is,
your
honor.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
i
am
in
kind
to
think
he
did
your
honor
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
he
had
been
dealing
with
this
for
years
and
years
and
as
his
remarks
in
the
record
would
indicate,
he
was
very,
very
familiar
with
the
facts
of
the
case.
he
spent
a
lot
of
time
going
over
it
and
so
i
would
say
--
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
general
mead.
ms.
julia
p.
cooper
that
is
correct
sir.
so
i
would
say
that
they're
not
merely
considerations
here
of
transporting
back
for
re-sentencing
in
many
instances
from
long
distances,
but
there
is
a
very
real
consideration
of
economy,
of
judicial
time
and
procedure
and
while
these
considerations
would
not
be
significant
if
they
were
balanced
against
a
deprivation
of
personal
liberty,
the
omission
of
allocution
we
say
such
a
deprivation
of
personal
liberty.
we
pointed
out
raising
of
jurisdictional
problems.
it
has
no
constitutional
implication.
as
i've
said
it
derived
from
common
law
practice
and
in
lieu
of
present
day
judicial
procedure
where
in
many
instances
there
is
a
pre-sentence
report.
the
accused
is
represented
by
counsel.
it
could
hardly
result
in
a
deprivation
of
personal
liberty.
one
final
word,
rule
32
(a)
we
think
can
be
distinguished
from
those
few
rules
of
federal
criminal
procedure
which
do
restate
basic
fundamental
constitutional
rights
and
therefore
may
probably
be
the
subject
of
collateral
attack.
such
a
rule
might
be
rule
43
which
requires
the
presence
of
a
defendant
in
every
stage
of
the
proceeding.
an
interesting
comparison
here
could
be
made
with
rule
10
which
protects
the
right
of
an
accused
to
be
present,
to
be
arraigned
in
open
court
and
to
be
informed
to
the
nature
and
acquisition
of
the
case
against
him
and
yet
the
courts
in
fifth,
tenth,
second
and
eighth
circuits
relying
in
this
court's
opinion
in
garland
versus
washington
has
held
that
literal
non-compliance
with
rule
10
is
not
a
jurisdictional
defect
which
can
be
raised
collaterally.
this
court
in
the
garland
case
held
that
arraignment
and
plea
are
not
essential
to
due
process.
and
finally,
may
i
reemphasize
that
a
prisoner
asking
for
the
formality
of
allocution
in
a
collateral
proceeding
under
rule
35
or
section
2255
is
asking
for
more
than
the
believed
right
to
speak.
he's
asking
the
court
perhaps
years
after
sentencing,
perhaps
of
a
court
totally
unfamiliar
with
the
case
to
exercise
discretion
anew
in
reimposing
sentence
with
all
the
attending
difficulties
on
the
basis
of
facts
which
could
have
been
erred
to
the
time
of
appeal
and
which
might
have
been
before
the
court
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
right
should
not
be
permitted.
thank
you.
