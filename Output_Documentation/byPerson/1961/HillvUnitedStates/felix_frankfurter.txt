felix
frankfurter
when
was
this
point
first
raise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
the
time
that
it
was
sought
to
be
raised
on
an
original
--
on
an
application
for
an
original
petition
to
this
court
and
the
raising
of
it
below,
several
other
motions
were
admitted,
were
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
first
proceeding
is
in
1955
then
it
wasn't
raised
again
until
when,
1958?
when
was
this
proceeding
began?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
between
1955
and
1959,
he
raised
several
objections,
how
many,
three?
he
challenged
the
sentence
three
times,
but
not
on
this
ground,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
this
point
as
against
other
claims.
what
i
want
to
know
is
when
did
--
if
this
present
proceeding
began
in
1959,
when
was
it
contested
below
for
the
first
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
may
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
he
raise
it
in
his
first
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
application?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
at
least
made
two
--
he
brought
two
proceedings
challenging
the
validity
of
the
sentence
before
he
got
around
to
this
point,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
i'm
talking
about
the
lower
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
knew
about
the
point
in
1955
and
he
didn't
formally
raise
it
until
1958,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1957.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
the
meantime,
went
to
--
it
came
before
the
court
twice
for
relief
on
other
grounds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
count
the
one
that's
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
claim
made
under
32
(a)
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
passed
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
have
counsel
before
you
were
appointed
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
in
the
lower
courts.
in
all
these
proceedings,
did
he
have
counsel
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
a
change
of
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
heard
what
you
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
discussed
was
it
ms.
cooper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
discussed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
was
discussed
on
the
assumption
that
even
assuming
that
the
sentence
is
illegal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
ms.
cooper,
from
what
appears
on
page
18
general
davis,
i
don't
know,
some
of
the
generals,
general
mead
and
general
davis
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
general
davis
says
â€œi
think
it
has
been
developed
in
the
proof
the
character
of
this
defendant
and
the
other
crime
which
he
has
committed
that
those
matters
must
have
been
before
the
court.
