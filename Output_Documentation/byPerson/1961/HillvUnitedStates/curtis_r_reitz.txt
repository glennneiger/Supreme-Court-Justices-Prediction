mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
if
the
court
please,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
seeking
relief
from
an
illegal
sentence
imposed
by
a
federal
district
court
on
june
4,
1954.
he
had
been
found
guilty
of
transporting
a
stolen
motor
vehicle
in
interstate
commerce
and
of
transporting
across
state
lines
a
person
who
had
been
kidnapped
and
held
for
ransom.
the
transcript
of
what
transpired
at
the
sentencing
proceeding
is
in
the
record
of
page
18
and
is
the
core
of
this
case,
beginning
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
the
page.
it's
quite
brief.
first,
the
court
said,
does
the
government
cared
to
say
anything,
this
was
following
the
conviction
and
counsel
for
the
government
said
that
he
did
not
care
to
make
a
statement
that
the
character
of
the
defendant
and
his
other
crimes
had
been
developed
in
proof
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
the
court
then
inquired
whether
his
memory
was
correct
as
to
the
disposition
of
other
--
of
the
defendants
in
these
cases
and
the
counsel
for
the
government
replied
that
the
one
defendant
had
received
the15-year
sentence
and
a
2-year
sentence
and
the
--
that
a
minor
had
received
a
smaller
sentence.
the
court
said,
that's
the
way
i
remembered
it,
and
they
are
found
on
page
19
of
the
record
without
any
further
inquiry,
the
court
proceeded
to
impose
sentence.
specifically,
the
court
did
not
inquire
of
the
defendant
whether
he
wanted
to
make
a
statement
in
his
own
behalf.
he
did
not
inquire
whether
the
defendant
wished
to
present
any
information
in
litigation
of
the
punishment.
nor
did
they
make
any
such
inquiries
of
counsel.
there
were
absolutely
no
questions
at
all
in
the
record
which
would
constitute
a
compliance
of
rule
32
(a)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
is
the
underlying
rule
in
this
case.
the
rule
which
is
in
petitioner's
brief
on
page
2
states
the
relevant
portion
of
the
second
sentence
of
32
(a),
â€œbefore
imposing
sentence,
the
court
shall
afford
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
make
a
statement
in
his
own
behalf
and
to
present
any
information
for
litigation
and
punishment.
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
green
versus
united
states,
it
is
plain
on
the
face
of
the
record
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
rule
32
(a)
and
that
point,
i
may
say,
is
not
in
contest
any
longer
in
this
case.
the
government
now
concedes
in
this
court
for
the
first
time
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
rule
32
(a)
in
the
treatment
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
in
the
lower
courts,
the
government
took
precisely
the
opposite
position.
the
case
now
comes
before
the
court
of
course
in
a
petition
for
collateral
relief.
on
october
21,
1959,
petitioner
filed
a
motion
to
vacate
the
sentences
based
upon
several
grounds
and
that
motion
is
in
the
record
at
page
26.
the
district
court
summarily
denied
the
motion
without
any
proceedings
whatsoever,
writing
an
opinion
which
is
found
on
page
41.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
in
the
brief
per
curiam
opinion
and
then
this
court
granted
certiorari
limited,
however,
to
a
specific
question
whether
petitioner
may
raise
his
claim
under
the
federal
criminal
rule
32
(a)
in
the
proceeding
he
has
now
brought.
the
other
issues
which
were
raised
by
petitioner
in
his
motion
for
relief
are
therefore
not
presently
relevant.
in
a
sense,
i
suppose,
this
case
is
a
continuation
of
where
the
green
case
left
off
last
term.
the
court
then
did
not
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
collateral
relief
was
available
in
the
case
was
a
violation
of
32
(a)
because
on
the
facts,
four
members
of
the
court
found
that
32
(a)
had
been
complied
with
and
mr.
justice
stewart
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
rule
should
have
prospective
operation
only
in
requiring
a
specific
question
addressed
to
the
defendant.
so
the
question
now
before
the
court
in
view
of
the
clear,
plain
violation
of
32
(a)
is
the
one
not
decided
in
green
which
is
whether
a
collateral
remedy
is
available
for
this
violation.
in
raising
this
question,
petitioner
sought
relief
under
section
2255
of
the
judicial
code.
at
the
present
time,
i
would
like
first
to
argue
that
he
is
entitled
to
relief
under
rule
35
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
the
government
does
not
challenge
the
possibility
of
interchanging
the
remedy
at
this
stage
and
i
will
explain
later
why
i
think
it
is
perhaps
important
to
the
defendant
that
this
be
done.
rule
35
provides,
and
it's
on
page
2
of
petitioner's
brief,
the
court
may
correct
an
illegal
sentence
at
any
time.
the
green
case,
the
court
will
recall,
was
specifically
raised
under
rule
35
and
decided
in
light
of
that
rule
and
the
question
now
relevant
is
whether
or
not
this
is
an
illegal
sentence.
we
are
dealing
of
course
with
a
rule
of
procedure
in
this
case,
a
procedure
set
forth
by
rule
32
(a)
with
respect
to
sentencing.
one
of
the
remarkable
things
about
the
administration
of
criminal
law
generally
in
the
last
few
years
is
the
recognition
long
overdue,
i
may
say,
of
the
importance
of
the
procedure
of
sentencing.
we
have
a
great
body
of
law
which
deals
with
the
procedures
surrounding
the
trial
of
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
but
we
have
virtually
no
procedures
at
present
which
deal
with
sentencing
as
such.
this
is
remarkable
in
light
of
the
fact
that
more
than
90%
of
the
defendants
who
appear
in
criminal
court,
in
a
federal
criminal
court
and
are
convicted,
do
so
on
a
guilty
plea
so
that
the
only
real
judicial
function
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
is
the
function
of
sentencing.
the
issues
of
guilt
are
foreclosed
by
the
plea
of
guilty
and
the
only
thing
which
the
judge
really
learns
about
the
defendant
is
learn
in
the
course
of
imposing
sentence.
the
only
provision
in
the
rules
as
presently
devised
which
offer
the
defendant
any
right
whatsoever
in
connection
with
the
procedure
of
sentencing
is
rule
32
(a).
the
government
has
taken
the
position
that
this
is
a
nice
rule,
a
rule
of
sound
practice,
but
one
which
can
be
dispensed
with
without
any
great
harm
to
the
defendant.
petitioner
takes
exactly
the
opposite
position
that
for
most
defendants,
this
is
the
single
most
important
rule
in
the
entire
set
of
federal
criminal
rules.
there
are
of
course
procedural
rules
which
we
might
call
housekeeping
rules,
which
simply
provide
for
a
settled
order
a
way
of
conducting
the
proceedings
of
the
trial
which
are
not
terribly
important
and
which
can
perhaps
be
dispensed
with
without
great
harm
to
the
litigants.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
procedural
rules
such
as
rule
32
(a)
which
have
underlying
and
powerful
reasons
of
policy.
there
were
several
such
rules
in
the
body
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
rule
11
and
rule
44
are
rules
which
specifically
reflect
constitutional
rights
of
a
person
accused
of
crime
and
in
their
own
way
they
provide
a
procedural
setting
for
vindicating
those
constitutional
rights.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
rule
32
(a)
is
of
similar
vintage.
this
is
apparent
in
the
first
place
on
the
face
of
the
language.
this
court
in
adopting
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
did
so
with
great
care
and
study
and
there
were
--
there
was
of
course
the
advisory
committee
which
worked
for
the
court
and
with
the
court.
there
were
two
preliminary
drafts
which
were
published,
commented
on
by
the
bar
and
there's
of
course
the
final
draft.
the
language
of
rule
32
(a),
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
you,
contains
the
unique
requirement
of
imposing
upon
the
trial
judge
the
obligation
to
initiate
a
procedural
move
for
the
protection
of
the
defendant.
that
is
done
in
very
few
instances.
it
is
done
in
rule
11
where
the
court
is
obliged
to
undertake
an
inquiry
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
plea
of
guilty
is
voluntary.
it
is
also
in
rule
44
where
the
court
is
obliged
to
advise
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
counsel.
it
is
also
in
rule
32
(a)
where
the
court
is
obliged
to
afford
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
make
a
statement
in
his
own
behalf
and
to
present
any
information
and
litigation
or
punishment.
in
this
case
itself,
i
think
we
have
dramatic
illustration
of
why
this
right
is
so
very
important
to
a
defendant.
one
of
the
charges
against
the
petitioner
was
of
course
kidnapping.
on
the
kidnapping
charge,
the
petitioner
could
have
received
as
a
sentence
following
conviction.
he
could
have
received
probation,
no
imprisonment
at
all
or
in
terms
of
the
statute,
he
could
have
received
any
term
of
years
for
life
imprisonment.
the
range
of
punishment
open
to
the
court
on
conviction
in
this
case
ran
from
zero
years
to
life
imprisonment.
this
is
a
remarkable,
a
dramatic
change
from
the
situation
which
existed
at
the
common
law
where
the
court
at
the
time
of
sentencing
had
virtually
no
discretion
at
all
with
respect
to
the
punishment
to
be
imposed
upon
the
convicted
defendant.
it
has
been
said
and
this
court
said
in
the
green
case
that
the
sentence
of
rule
32
(a)
here
relevant
derives
from
and
is
a
modern
equivalent
of
the
common
law
right
of
allocution.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
it's
a
little
more
than
that,
and
a
lot
more
than
that
because
the
common
law
right
of
allocution
protected
only
a
very
few
incidents
of
the
defendant's
rights.
a
defendant
in
response
to
the
allocution
from
the
court,
the
allocatus,
could
raise
only
a
few
possible
reasons
why
sentences
should
not
be
imposed,
and
for
the
most
part,
it
was
an
all
or
nothing
proposition,
no
attempt
to
influence
the
court
in
exercising
any
discretion.
a
defendant
could
say
that
he
had
been
pardoned
and
if
that
were
true,
no
sentence
could
be
imposed.
the
defendant
could
show
that
he
was
insane
and
had
become
insane
since
conviction,
a
rare
incident,
i'm
sure
in
that
case
sentence
could
not
be
imposed.
the
defendant
could
show
that
he
was
not
the
same
person
who
had
been
convicted,
that
there
was
a
change
in
identity
somehow
between
the
conviction
in
the
sentence
and
this
would
prevent
sentence
or
in
a
capital
case,
a
woman
who
had
been
convicted
of
a
capital
crime
could
show
that
she
was
pregnant,
in
which
case,
she
could
not
be
executed
while
she
was
pregnant,
but
all
of
these
reasons
which
pretty
much
sum
up
the
entirety
of
common
law
right
of
allocution
went
to
whether
or
not
sentence
could
be
imposed.
of
course,
today,
the
sentencing
process
has
become
a
discretionary
process
where
as
in
this
case,
an
enormously
wide
range
of
punishment
from
which
the
judge
must
select.
on
conviction,
there
is
no
indication
into
which
range
of
punishments,
any
particular
defendant
goes
and
our
modern
theory
of
punishment
discussed
by
this
court
very
well
in
the
williams
case,
williams
versus
new
york,
is
turning
more
and
more
towards
individualization
of
punishment
so
that
it
becomes
more
and
more
important
that
the
court
be
informed
of
the
relevant
facts
going
to
punishment
and
this,
more
so,
i
suggest
in
the
common
law
right
of
allocution,
is
what
underlies
rule
32
(a).
it
is
the
only
means
offered
to
the
defendant
to
participate
in
informing
the
court
of
what
is
relevant
in
the
choice
of
his
sentence
and
it
is
for
this
reason,
as
i
say,
perhaps
the
single
most
important
rule
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
as
they
stand
today.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that
is
right.
rule
35
or
32
(c)
states
it
as
optional
whether
or
not
the
judge
wishes
to
have
it,
he
can
order
that
it
not
be
made.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
believe
there
was
your
honor,
although
i
don't
think
it
appeared
in
the
record.
the
--
there
is
some
indication
that
the
judge
was
informed
of
the
prior
record
of
the
defendant
and
i
assume
that
came
from
a
pre-sentence
report.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
sir.
it
was
strictly
a
rule
35
case.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
your
honor.
it
was
instituted
in
the
lower
courts
as
a
motion
under
section
2255,
yes
sir
and
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
now
that
it'd
be
treated
as
a
rule
35
case.
perhaps
i'd
better
deal
with
that
at
this
point.
the
government's
position
on
rule
35,
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
the
--
it
would
appear
that
the
government
finds
rule
35
totally
swallowed
up
by
section
2255.
both
of
these
remedies
came
into
existence
at
approximately
the
same
time,
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
with
rule
35
was
enacted
in
its
present
form
in
1946,
or
promulgated
in
1946.
section
2255
came
into
the
judicial
code
in
1948
as
a
part
of
the
revision
process,
but
the
prior
legislative
work
on
both
the
rule
and
the
statutory
remedy
were
running
concurrently
from
the
early
1940s.
to
say
that
rule
35
and
section
2255
cover
identical
materials,
or
in
the
government's
words
that
rule
35
is
a
more
narrow
version
of
the
remedy
available
under
section
2255
is
to
deprive
the
rule
of
all
possible
reason
for
being
and
this
is
almost
belied
by
the
fact
that
these
two
remedies
were
brought
into
the
legal
realm
at
almost
identical
moments.
the
position
i
would
urge
this
court
to
take
and
i
will
say
this,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
confusion
as
to
the
scope
of
both
of
these
remedies
in
prior
decisions.
the
position
that
i
urge
the
court
to
take
is
that
rule
35
is
limited
exclusively
to
defects
in
sentencing
whereas
section
2255
is
much
broader
and
goes
to
all
those
defects
which
could
upset
the
conviction
itself.
now,
this
is
a
very
important
point
because
it
bears
heavily
on
what
happens
as
a
result
of
granting
relief
and
therefore
bears
heavily
on
the
scope
of
the
remedy
which
is
desirable
in
these
circumstances.
i
would
suggest
that
rule
35
be
limited
to
those
situations
in
which
the
only
remedy
sought
is
a
re-sentence.
in
any
instance
in
which
the
remedy
sought
would
require
a
retrial,
the
appropriate
remedy
would
be
section
2255.
in
this
way,
both
of
these
rules
would
have
an
area
of
independent
operation
and
it
would
be
possible
to
conceive
of
a
remedy
in
rule
35,
contrary
to
the
government,
being
much
broader
than
the
kind
of
remedy
permissible
under
section
2255
because
society
has
a
rightful
interest
in
not
unnecessarily
upsetting
convictions
of
long
standing
and
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
in
the
implication
of
either
of
these
remedies.
it
is
possible
to
upset
a
conviction
under
the
present
rules
regardless
of
how
long
it
was
obtained,
in
which
case,
simply
through
the
passage
of
time,
it
would
probably
impossible
in
many
situations
to
obtain
a
new
conviction.
the
only
remedy
being
sought
by
the
prisoner
in
this
case,
however,
is
the
right
to
have
a
legal
sentence.
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case
petitioner
concedes
the
validity
of
this
conviction.
there's
no
issue
open
on
which
he
could
say
otherwise.
all
he
is
seeking
is
the
right
to
have
a
legal
sentence
imposed
in
strict
conformity
to
his
right
under
rule
32
(a)
to
inform
the
court
on
those
factors
which
are
relevant
to
his
sentence,
a
right
which
he
had
been
totally
deprived
of
on
the
record
at
the
present
time.
the
government
has
taken
a
further
position
as
to
rule
35
which
it
seems
to
me
is
wholly
untenable.
now
perhaps
this
is
their
main
argument,
i'm
not
sure.
the
government
argues
that
rule
35
is
available
only
for
errors
which
appear
on
the
face
of
the
record.
that
has
never
been
decided
in
exactly
those
terms
by
this
court.
by
the
record,
the
government
means,
however,
not
what
we
would
expect
the
record
to
mean.
they
mean
the
equivalent
of
the
common
law
judgment
rule.
now
of
course
at
the
common
law,
this
was
the
whole
record.
there
were
no
other
records
kept.
the
argument
concerning
the
judgment
role
was
heard
regularly
in
proceedings
for
habeas
corpus
relief
in
the
last
century.
traditionally,
of
course,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
itself
in
the
case
of
an
attack
upon
a
conviction
would
lie
only
for
errors
that
appear
on
the
face
of
the
judgment
rule.
as
long
ago
as
1873,
however,
this
court
rejected
that
argument
in
a
habeas
corpus
case,
ex
parte
lange
and
held
that
the
record
kept
by
modern
courts
went
beyond
the
judgment
rule
and
in
that
case,
the
court
employed
the
minute
book
which
is
kept
by
trial
court's
entering
as
the
beginning
of
the
record
in
both
of
these
cases
shows
the
docket
entries,
the
minutes
of
the
court
at
the
various
stages
along
the
trial.
this
minute
book
was
of
course
a
form
of
record
totally
unknown
at
the
common
law.
the
government's
argument
actually
runs
directly
counter
to
what
this
court
did
in
the
green
case
where
the
â€“
apart
from
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
court
divided
exactly
on
how
to
read
the
transcript
of
sentence
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
common
law
judgment
rule,
never
has
been.
what
the
government
has
overlooked
is
the
court
reporter's
act,
adopted
in
1944
which
makes
it
mandatory
in
every
criminal
case
to
have
a
transcript
prepared
of
the
arraignment
and
sentencing
proceedings,
regardless
of
whether
anything
else
is
transcribed,
the
reporter
must
take
the
notes
and
transcribe
the
full
proceedings
of
arraignment
and
sentencing
and
this
is
made
the
part
of
the
record
in
this
case,
in
every
criminal
case.
that
statute
is
section
753
of
the
judicial
code
and
i
have
quoted
the
relevant
portions
of
it
on
page
8
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
there
may
be
sound
reasons
for
not
allowing
a
motion
under
rule
35
to
require
extrinsic
evidence
for
resolution.
the
government
is
plainly
wrong,
however,
in
suggesting
that
such
requirement
could
ever
arise
if
rule
35
is
used
to
inquire
in
the
compliance
with
rule
32
(a)
because
the
record
in
every
case
of
what
actually
took
place
in
the
courtroom
must
be
a
part
of
the
record
and
was
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
even
though
the
government
was
unaware
of
it
until
the
court
--
until
the
case
arrived
in
this
court.
therefore,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
granting
relief
in
this
case
could
not
possibly
lead
to
a
requirement
of
a
factual
inquiry.
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
looking
at
the
record
as
this
court
did
in
the
green
case
with
a
difficult
case
on
the
facts
in
green
case
and
deciding
whether
or
not
rule
32
(a)
has
been
complied
with.
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
inconvenience
to
the
government
or
even
inconvenience
to
the
court
in
making
such
an
inquiry.
it's
quite
simple,
quite
expeditious
and
it's
over
with
rather
quickly.
of
course,
if
the
court
should
determine
that
rule
35
is
not
an
appropriate
remedy
in
this
case
for
some
reason,
petitioner
would
still
revert
back
to
his
claim
for
relief
under
section
2255
of
the
judicial
code.
i
don't
think
that
as
far
as
the
scope
of
the
remedy
under
section
2255,
that
petitioner
and
the
government
are
really
in
disagreement.
i
think
we
both
agree
that
a
post-conviction
remedy
which
opens
up
factual
inquiries,
which
opens
up
the
possibility
of
upsetting
a
conviction
of
many
years
standing,
such
a
remedy
has
to
be
limited
to
those
errors
which
are
of
the
greatest
importance
in
the
administration
of
criminal
law
and
this
has
always
been
true.
the
original
writ
of
habeas
corpus
inquired
only
into
the
bare
competence
of
the
court
which
at
that
time
was
thought
to
be
the
only
way
which
was
entitled
to
post-conviction
vindication.
over
the
past
century,
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus
has
grown
enormously
in
criminal
law
and
i
submit
that
growth
process
ought
not
to
stop.
the
government
i
think
has
taken
on
a
false
issue
by
arguing
to
this
court
that
section
2255
is
no
broader
than
habeas
corpus
and
then
looking
at
habeas
corpus
as
it
was
defined
in
the
19th
century
where
they
find
exactly
two
cases
dealing
with
sentencing,
and
therefore
it
follows
in
their
logic
that
there's
no
remedy
under
section
2255.
the
first
difficulty
with
the
argument
of
course
is
that
the
habeas
corpus
cases
they
find
are
19th
century
cases.
the
government
did
not
even
find
for
example
that
habeas
corpus
would
protect
a
right
of
a
prisoner
to
be
present
at
his
own
sentencing
simply
because
there
was
no
case
in
this
court
so
holding
in
the
19th
century
but
that
right
is
obviously
one
which
would
be
protected
by
post-conviction
relief.
nor
did
the
government
find
that
habeas
corpus
would
protect
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
have
counsel
in
sentencing,
there
were
just
no
such
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
the
19th
century,
but
these
rights,
procedural
rights
are
obviously
fundamental
and
important
to
the
defendant
and
would
obviously
have
been
protected
by
this
court
under
habeas
corpus,
are
being
protected
by
lower
courts
under
section
2255
and
deal
with
sentencing.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
sir,
it
appears
quite
clearly
that
he
was
not
given
an
opportunity
to
speak.
the
entire
proceeding
appears
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset
on
page
18
through
20
of
the
trans
--
of
the
record,
starting
with
the
reporter's
note
that
the
case
was
called
for
judgment,
the
only
inquiry
made
by
the
court
was
addressed
to
counsel
for
the
government,
no
inquiry
was
made
whatsoever
even
to
the
defendant
or
to
its
counsel.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
sir,
counsel
for
the
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
think
it
might
your
honor.
the
lower
courts,
as
you're
perhaps
aware,
had
half
a
dozen
or
more
similar
cases
and
there
have
been
those
cases
in
which
counsel
actually
spoke
in
behalf
of
the
defendant.
in
no
such
case
has
a
lower
court
ever
granted
a
relief.
there
is
only
one
case
in
the
lower
courts,
exactly
like
this
one
that
i
know
of
that's
the
jenkins
case
decided
by
the
district
of
columbia,
in
that
case,
neither
defendant
nor
his
counsel
spoke
and
the
court
granted
relief
under
section
2255.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
therefore
that
primarily,
petitioner
is
entitled
to
relief
under
rule
35,
the
rule
which
explicitly
and
purposely
deals
with
sentencing
and
a
rule
which
by
virtue
of
its
necessary
limitations
does
not
have
to
be
as
narrow
in
scope
as
the
broader,
the
more
general
post-conviction
remedy
under
section
2255,
but
that
in
any
event,
petitioner
has
an
important,
a
fundamental
right
applying
to
the
very
core
of
the
case
against
him
which
ought
to
be
vindicated
even
under
section
2255.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
rule
32
(a)
violation?
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
point
was
first
raised
your
honor
to
my
knowledge
in
this
court
in
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
by
the
prisoner,
an
original
petition
filed
in
this
court.
the
--
in
a
footnote
on
page
8
and
9
of
petitioner's
brief,
i
give
a
citation
to
that
case,
number
373
miscellaneous
october
term
1955.
that
writ
was
denied
by
the
court
without
any
hearing.
the
issue
was
next
raised
to
my
knowledge
in
the
--
what
was
the
--
the
third
effort
by
this
prisoner
of
post-conviction
relief,
the
1958
proceeding
and
was
summarily
disposed
of
by
the
court
and
was
raised
again
in
this
--
his
fourth
application
for
2255
relief.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
sir.
this
man
has
been
in
the
courts
constantly,
i
think
since
he's
been
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
this
proceeding
began
on
october
1959.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
your
honor.
i
believe
from
1955
on
he's
been
raising
this
constantly.
the
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
he's
been
in
this
court
actually
since
this
case
was
â€“
since
cert
was
granted
in
this
case.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
rule
32
(a)
point?
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
it
was
contested
in
the
sense
that
it
was
validly
raised
in
the
lower
court
in
his
third
application
for
relief
which
was
filed
in
1957
and
decided
in
1958.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
to
my
knowledge,
the
only
--
the
only
time
he
has
missed
raising
it
and
he
has
raised
a
lot
of
issues
in
the
course
of
time,
the
only
time
he
missed
raising
it
from
the
time
he
first
raised
it
in
1955
in
this
court
was
in
his
second
application
for
2255
relief
which
was
in
1956.
i
think
that
when
i
actually
overlapped
in
the
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
he
did
not.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
he
did
not.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
well,
the
--
he
raised
the
issue
between
the
first
and
second
2255
motion.
he
raised
32
(a)
point
in
a
habeas
corpus
petition
in
this
court.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
in
the
lower
courts,
there
were
two
motions
in
which
the
objection
under
rule
32
(a)
was
not
raised,
that's
right
and
this
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
i
have
--
it
seemed
expedient
to
ask
for
relief
under
rule
35.
the
rule
explicitly
states
that
relief
is
available
anytime
and
this
court
indicated
in
the
callanan
case
that
the
repetitive
nature
of
the
motion
would
not
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
1957.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
sir.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes
sir.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no,
once.
he
--
his
second
petition
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that's
right.
he
had
two
2255
--
his
first
2255
motions
did
not
include
this
point.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that's
right.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that's
right.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
which
question
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
failure
to
raise
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
no
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
never
been
dealt
with
at
all.
the
lower
court
twice
has
in
a
very
general
statement
indicated
that
it
is
not
the
kind
of
issue
that
they
would
deal
with
in
prior
relief.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
there
is
none.
there
is
no
specific
reference
in
the
court's
opinion
to
the
rule
32
(a)
motion.
the
motion
as
i
said
raised
a
lot
of
issues
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
--
in
addition
to
this
and
all
the
court
said
was
the
last
paragraph
that
the
court
has
reexamined
the
motions
as
of
the
opinion
of
the
files
and
records
conclusively
show
that
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
any
relief.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
that
was
the
third
motion
(voice
overlap).
the
third
motion
raised
a
serious
question
of
denial
of
right
to
appeal.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
and
the
lower
court
had
denied
summarily
and
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
for
a
hearing
which
was
limited
to
that
specific
allegation
of
denial
of
the
right
to
appeal
and
was
found
against
him.
the
hearing
in
that
case
did
not
deal
with
rule
32
(a),
the
district
judge
excluded
the
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes,
your
honor.
the
motion
in
that
proceeding
--
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
only
insofar
as
the
court
indicated
that
it
was
not
the
kind
of
issue
that
the
court
thought
would
entitle
the
petitioner
to
a
collateral
relief.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
the
decision
was
1958.
i
refer
to
that
on
page
6
and
7
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
he
had
counsel
in
both
the
lower
courts.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
i
believe
so
your
honor.
he's
had
a
whole
series
of
court
appointed
counsel.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
yes.
no
counsel
has
ever
appeared
in
two
courts
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
curtis
r.
reitz
none
of
the
counsel
in
this
case
has
ever
appeared
in
two
courts.
the
counsel
in
the
lower
court
disappeared
before
the
appellate
proceeding.
