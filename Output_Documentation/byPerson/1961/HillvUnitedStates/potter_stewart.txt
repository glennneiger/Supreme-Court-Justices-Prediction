under
the
rules,
it's
optional,
is

not,
whether
a

a
pre-sentence
investigation
for
this
probation?
justice

stewart
has
this
question
ever
been
dealt
with
by
the
district

or

35,
the
failure
to
ask
him
whether
or
not
he
had
anything
to
say.
justice
potter
stewart
never
been
dealt
with
at
all?

just
been
looking
over,
i
can't
find
any

this
question.

we
set
this
when
i

found
that
there
was
no
merit
on
the
--
in
the
claim
made
that
if
the
court
did
have
not
to
reach
whether
or
not
that
claim
to
be
raised
in
the
rule
35
motion.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
reached.

stewart
in
case
of
the
history
of
his
having
been
declared
first
incompetent
to
