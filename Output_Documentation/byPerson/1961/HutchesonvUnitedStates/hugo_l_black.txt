justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
this
--
they
have
authority
to
investigate
every
local
crimes
committed
in
the
unites
states
if
somebody
connected
with
the
labor
union
had
something
to
do
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
they
allege
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
alleged
local
drafts
in
indiana
having
anything
to
do
in
interstate
commerce
directly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
you
the
question
because
i
didn't
understand
you
were
arguing
or
going
far
enough
to
say
that
a
committee
could
set
itself
up
as
the
investigator
of
purely
local
crimes
all
over
the
country
so
that
it
could
bring
about
a
better
enforcement
of
the
local
criminal
laws.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it's
a
sufficient
answer
simply
to
show
as
a
matter
of
federal
concern?
what
branch
of
the
federal
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
makes
a
--
does
that
make
a
difference
under
our
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
branch
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it's
held
in
one
case,
if
they
can
go
to
the
extent
where
it's
shown
to
be
a
matter
for
the
judicial
branch.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
what
i
meant
was
that
it's
not
enough
simply
to
say
something
to
federal
concern,
there's
two
branches
of
government
--
or
three
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
has
something
to
do
with
that.
and
whenever
it
reaches
a
point,
i
think
it
was
held
in
one
case
it
appears
to
me,
an
effort
to
the
trial
or
to
do
something
to
somebody
for
what
they've
done
instead
of
really
a
genuine
matter
of
legislative
concern,
then
it's
not
enough
to
say
a
federal
concern,
it
has
to
be
a
matter
of
legislative
concern,
it
has
a
right
to
do
what
it
is
there,
do
it,
and
go
as
far
as
it
is
they
are
going.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
of
course
a
--
it's
of
course
a
matter
of
legislative
concern
in
connection
with
the
labor
union,
to
regulate
what
they
do
in
a
way.
that
does
not
mean
i
suppose,
that
in
asking
--
having
investigation
to
branch
over
into
the
department
which
shows
that
your
purpose
and
that
is
--
is
to
do
something
to
somebody
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
they've
done
which
might
be
punishable
locally
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
federally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
understand
that
either
of
those
cases
or
the
daugherty
case
supported
to
overrule
kilbourn
and
thompson,
in
that
aspect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
connection,
i
--
you
referred
us
parts
of
the
record.
i
don't
understand
why
some
of
them
are
there.
they
show
where
a
witness
has
claimed
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination
and
the
interrogator
without
accepting
that
at
all,
continued
to
ask
repeatedly
detailed
questions.
do
you
deny
--
do
you
testify
about
this
and
this
without
recognizing
in
effect
--
substantial
effect
is
claim
on
self-incrimination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
asked
many
more
questions
after
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination
has
been
asked.
now,
i've
been
unable
to
find
yet
the
purpose
of
those
repeated
question
if
it
was
not
a
denial,
the
man's
benefit
of
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
question
i
was
asking
you
about
was
not
with
reference
to
the
petitioner
which
seemed
to
be
a
part,
back
at
the
place
where
you
referred
use
to
where
a
witness
after
having
claimed
his
privilege
of
self-incrimination
was
repeatedly
asked,
if
he
honestly
believed
that
he
gave
that
--
that
would
incriminate,
in
other
words
are
you
willing
--
afraid
to
ask
--
answer,
repeatedly,
he
was
pounded
with
questions
of
that
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
“are
you
really
guilty,”
that's
in
substance
what
the
question
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
read
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
he
claims
self-incrimination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
is
it
your
idea
that
--
that
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination
starts
when
a
man
claims
it
honestly,
he
can
be
held
on
the
stand
for
hours
for
instance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
ask
you
if
he's
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
just
try
to
persuade
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
reflect
a
light
with,
might
it,
on
what
the
committee
was
doing,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
investigation,
whether
it
was
pertinent,
whether
it
was
a
real
legislative
inquiry
or
something
like
kilbourn
and
thompson.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
material
if
--
if
you
assumed
that
exposure
for
exposure's
sake
cannot
be
done
by
the
committee
constitutionally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
it'll
be
relevant
even
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
--
suppose
--
is
this
relevant
to
reaching
a
conclusion
on
that
point?
are
you
arguing
on
the
basis
that
exposure
for
exposure's
sake
can
be
done
by
the
committee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
least
now,
i
want
to
make
it
clear.
i
understood
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
like
to
interrupt
you,
but
i
don't
quite
--
suppose
that
this
is
pertinent
and
the
general
statement
is
generally
pertinent
to
find
out
if
they're
misusing
union
funds,
that
wouldn't
mean,
would
it,
that
they
could
put
on
500
witnesses
to
show
that
for
the
idea
that
it
was
still
necessary
for
the
legislative
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
was
an
exaggeration
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
point
out
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
if
you
can
see
the
point,
i
was
--
