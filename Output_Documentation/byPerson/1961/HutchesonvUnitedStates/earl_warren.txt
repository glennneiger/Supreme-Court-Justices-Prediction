chief
justice
earl
warren
how
was
that
different
from
blaier's
refusal
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
contemporaneous
with
the
--
with
the
hearing
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
the
last
question
come
first?
chief
justice
earl
warren
colonel,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
when,
with
relation
to
the
trial
under
the
indictment
was
this
finding
made
by
the
committee,
the
one
you
have
just
read?
was
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before
or
after
the
trial
under
the
indictment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
whether
this
petitioner
in
any
portion
of
the
statement
before
the
committee
did
say
to
the
committee
that
his
reason
was
the
same
as
that
given
by
mr.
blaier?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
did
he
say
in
at
--
at
any
place,
that
the
reason
he
didn't
want
to
testify
was
because
it
would
compel
him
to
give
evidence
that
would
help
the
prosecution
in
the
indictment
which
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
--
if
that
is
the
gravamen
of
his
objection,
where
in
his
--
are
there
any
real
difference
between
his
objection
and
blaier's?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
think
it's
a
fair
reading
of
mr.
blaier's
objection
to
testifying
that
he
claimed
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
chief
justice
earl
warren
both
were
taken
by
the
same
reasoning
that
if
this
petitioner
said
that
he
wouldn't
testify
because
if
he
did,
it
would
help
the
prosecution
that
he
ought
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
same
reasoning
of
quinn
and
emspak
that
he
--
he
fairly
raised
before
the
committee
his
reason
for
--
for
not
testifying
therefore,
the
committee
should
have
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
say
to
mr.
blaier,
“you've
invoked.
you
have
not
invoked
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
therefore
we
let
you
go,”
did
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
not
interested
in
what
the
press
said
either,
but
i
am
interested
in
--
in
what
the
reaction
of
the
committee
was
to
that
statement
by
counsel.
did
the
committee
then
say
we
make
a
differentiation
between
you
and
mr.
blaier
because
we
consider
that
mr.
blaier
raised
the
fifth
amendment,
but
--
that
you
did
not
therefore,
we
treat
you
differently.
is
there
anything
by
fair
implication
which
show
that
the
committee
so
treated
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
think
they
in
asking
these
questions
that
they
did
ask
of
him,
that
they
arrived
at
that
point
that
you
just
spoke
of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
