justice
potter
stewart
colonel
wiener,
the
--
the
indictment
which
was
actually
pending
involved
a
charge
not
of
obstruction
of
justice,
but
rather
of
land
fraud,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
for
obstructing
justice
--
the
charge
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
now,
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
selling
land
to
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
now
was
there
ever
an
indictment
for
obstructing
justice?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
very
purpose
of
the
committee,
it's
very
authorizing
resolution,
created
it
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
criminal
activity
among
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
wouldn't
your
argument
colonel
wiener
lead
to
a
--
the
conclusion
that
the
--
that
this
resolution
creating
this
committee
was
--
was
improper
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
certainly
possible
that
they
might
find
that
activities
which
are
criminal
on
the
state
law
had
been
engaged
in
and
that
the
object
of
a
possible
outcome
of
their
investigation
might
be
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
legisla
--
sponsorship
of
a
federal
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
follow
that.
justice
potter
stewart
why
you
must
make
that
assumption?
in
this
very
case
of
course
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
activity
was
criminal
under
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
--
state,
not
federal
law.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
authorizing
resolution?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
would
have
been
admissible?
