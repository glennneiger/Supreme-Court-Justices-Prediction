justice
charles
e.
whittaker
colonel
wiener,
what
difference
would
there
be
in
pre-trying
the
issue
in
advance
of
an
indictment
over
trying
the
issue
before
a
legislative
committee
after
an
indictment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
then,
this
argument
would
mean
that
a
legislative
committee
could
not
inquire
a
bad
conduct
or
investigate
it,
if
it
was
likely
later
to
result
in
an
indictment.
