mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
our
view
of
this
case
with
respect
both
to
the
facts
and
the
questions
presented
is
quite
different
from
that
of
petitioners.
indeed,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
eventual
outcome
probably
depends
more
than
anything
else
on
whether
our
appraisal
is
what
occurred
or
the
petitioner's
appraisal
of
what
occurred
is
the
more
accurate.
as
we
see
it,
what
occurred
can
be
fairly
summarized
in
four
points;
first,
the
mcclellan
committee
did
not
inquire
into
the
real
estate
transactions
and
alleged
bribery
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
marion
county
indictment.
indeed,
it
asked
no
questions
which
barred
directly
upon
any
issue
raised
by
the
indictment
or
the
defense.
second,
the
mcclellan
committee
did
press
an
investigation
into
and
did
require
the
petitioner
to
answer
questions
concerning
the
alleged
use
of
labor
union
funds
for
the
purpose
of
obstructing
justice
in
lake
county,
indiana
after
the
highway
transaction
had
been
closed.
if
these
expenditures
were
made,
these
expenditures
of
union
funds,
then
of
course
they
violated
petitioner's
fiduciary
duties
to
the
union
members.
both
the
investigation
and
the
questions
put
to
petitioner
were
undeniably
pertinent
therefore
to
the
authorized
legislative
purposes
of
the
mcclellan
committee.
and
their
purpose
--
their
pertinence
was
clearly
explained
to
the
petitioner.
third,
the
authorized
investigation
for
legislative
purposes
might
have
shown
that
petitioner
was
engaged
in
what
i
have
called
a
--
an
effort
to
fix
the
investigation
in
the
lake
county,
an
investigation
into
the
highway
transaction,
and
therefore
those
questions
might
incidentally
have
produced
evidence
which
could
be
used
--
which
would
show
that
petitioner
had
a
consciousness
of
guilt
with
respect
to
the
underlying
marion
county
transaction,
and
which
therefore
we
agree
(inaudible)
if
answers
had
been
given,
have
been
used
against
him
in
the
trial
of
the
marion
county
indictment.
fourth,
when
the
pertinent
questions
with
this
collateral
impact
where
asked
petitioner
unequivocally,
repeatedly,
explicitly
and
with
the
advice
of
counsel,
disavowed
any
reliance
on
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
there's
no
resemblance,
i
think
between
the
situation
with
respect
to
mr.
blaier
and
the
situation
with
respect
to
petitioner.
blaier
said
that
the
he
refused
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
the
questions
relates
to
or
might
be
claimed
to
relate
to
or
aid
the
prosecution
in
the
case
in
which
i
am
under
indictment
and
stopped
there.
petitioner,
both
before
and
after
saying
that,
said
i
do
not
rely
on
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
blaier
never
said
this.
blaier
indeed
was
understood
by
the
press
and
i
take
it
by
the
committee
as
the
record
shows
to
have
been
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
so
of
course,
the
circumstances
in
this
respect
are
quite
different.
those,
as
i
see
it,
are
the
essential
path
in
the
collateral
relation
between
the
authorized
investigation
into
the
lake
county
alleged
obstruction
of
justice,
and
the
underlying
highway
scandal.
does
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
his
counsel
at
the
time
petitioner
was
questioned,
which
followed
the
questioning
of
blaier,
did
say
that
he
wanted
to
correct
the
misapprehension
which
the
press
had
gained,
he
didn't
say
the
committee
had
gained,
but
which
the
press
had
gained,
and
that
blaier
was
not
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
by
that
time,
of
course,
blaier
had
been
excused.
he's
off
the
stand.
when
i
say
excused,
i
--
to
be
honest
i
don't
recall
whether
he'd
been
released
from
under
subpoena
or
not,
but
he
was
off
the
stand.
the
questioning
of
him
was
over.
now
i
suppose
that
it
could've
been
inferred
from
then,
that
the
petitioner
was
seeking
to
make
the
same
kind
of
claim
that
blaier
and
his
counsel
subjectively
thought
that
blaier
had
been
making.
but
there
is
still
is
the
fact
that
petitioner
said
something
that
blaier
never
said
to
the
committee,
whatever
his
subjective
thoughts
have
been
made.
petitioner
said,
“i
waived
the
privilege,
not
in
those
words,
but
i
disavow
it,
i
don't
rely
on
it”
and
blaier
never
said
any
such
thing.
so
naturally
what
petitioner
did
say
carried
an
entirely
different
meaning,
i
think,
it
certainly
could
have
carried
a
different
meaning
to
the
members
of
the
mcclellan
committee
in
what
blaier
said.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
he
said
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
i
think,
it's
an
entirely
different
--
in
a
great
difference
in
the
way
this
left
the
committee.
let's
try
an
example
out
of
context.
suppose
that
i
were
asked
questions
about
a
conference
with
a
client,
and
i
said
i
refuse
to
answer
because
this
involves
something
i
said
to
my
client,
but
not
i'm
not
claiming
your
honor
the
lawyer
type
privilege.
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
think
it
was
fair
for
the
court
to
say,
“well,
you
haven't
claimed
the
privilege.
you
don't
stand
on
it.”
at
best,
from
the
petitioner's
standpoint,
these
things
would
seem
to
me
to
cancel
out.
furthermore,
i
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
was
not
a
matter
of
just
one
assertion,
that
there
was
any
possibility
of
misunderstanding.
the
chairman
of
the
committee
several
times
said
to
the
petitioner,
“do
i
understand
that
you
don't
rely
on
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination”
and
senator
ervin
said
the
same
thing,
and
each
time
he
said,
“no.”
then
the
discussion
with
senator
ervin
went
off
to
an
effort
to
explicate,
“well,
how
could
there
be
this
other
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment,
if
you
weren't
relying
on
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?”
and
that
was
usually
cut
off
and
i
think
quite
properly
because
the
petitioner
wasn't
a
lawyer,
and
was
obviously
in
no
position
to
discuss
it,
and
quite
obviously,
was
just
reading
what
his
lawyer
had
given
him
to
read.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
haven't
had
any
doubts,
your
honor,
that
on
that
--
on
the
record
of
the
inquiries
put
to
mr.
blaier,
that
if
the
privilege
had
been
disallowed
and
he
had
simply
stood
on
his
statement
and
refused
to
answer,
and
the
case
was
brought
here,
that
it
would've
held
that
he
had
properly
invoked
the
privilege
against
the
fifth
amendment
within
the
--
i
can't
think
of
the
name
of
the
case
now,
but
they
were
the
men
in
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
quinn,
and
there's
another
beginning
with
e
-
emspak.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
think
the
committee
quite
properly
said
that
no
particular
ritual
is
required.
what
the
man
is
saying
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
if
the
petitioner
had
not
explicitly
and
repeatedly
disavowed
relying
on
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
if
you
take
that
fact
away,
and
simply
take
the
language
that
the
petitioner
used
then
i
think
he
would
have
been
entitled
of
the
privilege,
but
here
he
said
over
and
over
again,
“i
don't
rely
on
the
privilege.”
i
don't
see
how
under
those
circumstances,
the
committee
was
under
an
obligation
to
say,
“oh,
yes,
you've
invoked
the
privilege,
we'll
give
it
to
you,”
and
he
said,
“no,
don't
give
it
to
me.”
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
in
--
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
didn't
say
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
do
know
that
petitioner's
--
all
we
know
about
that
beyond
the
bare
record
where
--
from
which
it
would
seem
to
me
it
was
a
fair
inference
that
that
was
what
he
was
claiming.
all
we
know
is
that
the
next
day,
mr.
travis,
his
attorney,
said
the
press
seems
to
have
gotten
the
impression
that
mr.
blaier
stood
on
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
that
was
what
he
was
doing.
now,
if
the
press
got
that
impression,
it
seems
to
me
likely
that
the
committee
had
the
same
impression,
and
when
he
used
the
words,
he
claimed
that
the
answers
might
aid
the
prosecution
in
a
case
in
which
i
am
under
indictment,
i
would
think
anyone
would
draw
the
conclusion
that
he
was
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
was
just
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
as
i
said
to
the
chief
justice,
i
think
the
words
are
clear
on
their
face.
perhaps,
i
shouldn't
have
invoked
this
little
bit
of
incidental
aid
from
the
record.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
sir.
no
one
suggested
to
the
committee
at
the
time
the
questions
were
being
put
to
mr.
blaier,
if
my
memory
is
correct,
that
the
petitioner
was
invoking
the
same
privilege
on
which
--
which
had
been
allowed
to
blaier,
except
that
--
i
don't
want
to
state
unfairly
--
there
was
this
little
reference
earlier
that
at
the
time
of
the
colloquy
about
the
petitioner's
asking,
if
my
memory
is
right,
there
was
no
reference
to
discrimination
between
the
petitioner
and
blaier,
and
i
must
say
given
this
record,
with
deference,
i
can't
see
how
anyone
could've
thought
the
two
were
the
same.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
he
was
not
because
he
was
allowed
the
privilege.
the
committee,
you
see,
mr.
justice
clark,
did
not
stand
on
the
murdock
case
and
allowed
the
privilege
even
so
theoretically
after
it
followed
the
murdock
case
it
might
have
disallowed
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
--
i
think
we
do
have
to
dispose
of
it
in
that
way.
i
suppose
that
the
government
--
i'm
not
sure
it's
material
but
i
think
in
terms
of
fairness,
that
the
government
should
point
out
that
there
was
no
discrimination
between
the
two
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
the
facts
of
the
record
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
in
order
to
deal
with
that
within
the
covers
of
the
record,
it
is
clear
that
the
statements
made
by
petitioner
were
very
different
from
the
statements
made
by
blaier.
so
that
there's
no
discrimination
between
the
two
in
the
way
the
committee
treated
them.
because
the
essential
difference
in
this
case
seems
to
us
to
turn
on
one's
appraisal
of
the
record.
i
wanted
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
to
develop
at
little
length
exactly
what
happened
in
a
broader
context
in
the
specific
pleas
made
by
blaier
and
the
petitioner.
in
the
background
of
these
hearings,
were
two
transactions
which
i
think
it
tried
to
characterize
as
related
but
quite
distinct.
one
of
them
is
what
i
would
call
the
indiana
highway
scandal.
according
to
widespread
reports,
petitioner
and
two
other
union
officials
had
bought
land
in
indiana
for
$20,000
in
an
area
where
it
was
expected
to
the
state
highway
would
be
laid
down.
they
bribed
an
official
named
doggett
in
the
indiana
highway
department
who
dealt
with
the
acquisition
of
rights
of
way,
and
then
transferred
the
rights
of
way
across
this
land
to
india
--
to
the
state
of
indiana
for
a
highway
for
the
sum
of
$78,000
or
about
four
times
what
they
paid
for
the
land.
when
questioned
about
this
transaction
before
another
senate
committee
some
time
before,
petitioner
claimed
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
prior
to
the
hearings
with
which
we
are
concerned,
he
and
his
associates
had
been
indicted
for
this
transaction,
the
highway
scandal,
in
marion
county
for
a
conspiracy
to
bribe,
and
actual
bribery
of
doggett.
it's
plain
that
the
indictment
had
not
been
tried
prior
to
the
time
when
petitioner
was
questioned
by
the
mcclellan
committee.
the
second
and
what
i
see
is
an
entirely
different
transaction
was
what
i
will
call
the
alleged
obstruction
of
justice
or
colloquially
an
attempt
to
fix
the
investigation
in
lake
county.
in
july
1957,
a
year
roughly
after
the
land
transactions
have
been
completed,
and
after
the
reports
of
the
alleged
bribery
were
out,
the
prosecutor
in
grand
county
of
lake
--
a
grand
jury
of
lake
county
began
an
investigation
into
the
highway
scandal.
this
was
before
the
indictment
had
been
returned
in
the
marion
county
seat.
after
a
few
days,
the
lake
county
investigation
was
dropped
and
holovachka,
the
prosecutor
had
announced
that
there
would
be
no
indictment.
sometime
later,
information
came
to
the
attention
of
the
mcclellan
committee
indicating
that
the
investigation
had
been
dropped
at
the
request
of
the
petitioner
and
his
union
associates.
as
a
result
of
the
bribes
that
had
been
paid
with
labor
union
funds,
and
through
a
series
of
labor
union
transactions
involving
the
teamsters,
and
through
the
influence
of
union
officials.
the
information
indicated
that
holovachka,
the
lake
county
prosecutor,
had
received
carpenters
union
funds.
what
raddock,
james
hoffa,
sawochka,
the
head
of
the
big
teamsters
union
in
lake
county,
teamsters
local
in
lake
county,
were
supposed
to
have
been
the
intermediaries.
the
lake
county
investigation
had
been
dropped
shortly
after
some
telephone
calls
had
been
made
from
a
chicago
hotel
to
hoffa
and
to
sawochka,
the
teamster
man,
in
lake
county.
the
calls
have
been
made
by
raddock.
they
were
paid
for
with
carpenters
union
funds.
at
the
time
raddock
made
the
calls,
petitioner
blaier
and
another
teamsters
official
had
been
staying
in
the
same
hotel,
and
the
hotel
bills
had
been
paid
for
with
labor
union
funds.
in
addition,
it
appeared
that
raddock
who
is
alleged
to
have
been
the
leading
man,
the
obstruction
of
justice,
had
received
$310,000
from
the
carpenter's
union
for
preparing
a
biography
of
a
former
president
of
the
union,
the
petitioner's
father,
and
the
evidence
before
the
mcclellan
committee
had
showed
that
the
work
at
most
should
have
cost
about
one-third
of
this
amount,
so
that
was
$200,000
roughly
unaccounted
for.
now,
it's
unquestionably
true
that
the
highway
transaction
in
the
alleged
obstruction
of
justice
were
related
in
two
ways.
the
lake
county
investigation
which
was
believed
to
have
been
fixed
by
the
use
of
union
funds
was
an
investigation
into
the
highway
transaction.
evidence
that
the
petitioner
attempted
to
stop
the
lake
county
investigation
might
have
been
admissible
against
him
in
the
trial
of
the
marion
county
indictment
on
the
theory
that
it
indicated
consciousness
that
the
effort
to
fix
indicated
the
consciousness
of
guilt,
and
of
course
under
familiar
rules
such
evidence
is
admissible
at
a
criminal
trail.
but
i
would
emphasize
that
in
every
other
respect,
these
were
two
distinct
transactions,
separate
in
both
time
and
place.
the
marion
county
indictment
could
be
and
indeed
it
later
was
tried
without
any
reference
to
the
attempted
obstruction
of
justice
in
lake
county,
and
the
alleged
obstruction
of
justice
in
lake
county
could
be
investigated
without
hearing
any
evidence
upon
the
bribery
or
the
real
estate
transaction
on
account
of
which
the
marion
county
indictment
had
been
returned.
taking
up
first
now,
the
lake
county
transactions,
i
submit
that
it
was
plainly
a
proper
subject
for
investigation
by
the
mcclellan
committee.
the
authorizing
resolution
appears
at
page
176
of
the
record,
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
page.
it
established
the
select
committee
which
was
authorized
and
directed
to
conduct
a
study
and
investigation
of
the
extent
to
which
criminal
or
other
improper
practices
or
activities
are
or
have
been
engaged
in
the
field
of
labor-management
relations
or
in
groups
or
organization
of
employees
or
employers
to
the
detriment
of
the
interest
of
the
public,
employers
or
employees,
and
to
determine
whether
any
changes
are
required
in
the
laws
of
united
states
in
order
to
protect
such
interests
against
the
occurrence
of
such
practices
or
activity.
petitioner
argues
in
several
points
in
his
brief
and
summarized
the
argument
here,
and
since
this
resolution
authorized
the
mcclellan
committee
to
investigate
criminal
activities,
it
directed
the
committee
to
investigate
the
activities
for
their
own
sake.
and
therefore,
attempted
unconstitutionally
to
have
it
act
as
sort
of
a
legislative
grand
jury,
prosecutor,
and
judge,
thus,
assuming
powers
which
are
given
to
the
executive
and
judiciary.
the
error
of
that
view,
it
seems
to
me,
becomes
perfectly
plain
when
one
reached
the
whole
resolution
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
background.
let
me
speak
very
briefly
about
the
background.
at
the
time
of
the
hearings,
although
the
federal
law
protected
and
encouraged
unionization
and
collective
bargaining,
there
was
no
federal
law
dealing
with
the
internal
affairs
of
labor
organizations,
none
relating
to
the
expenditure
or
management
of
union
funds,
non-declaring
or
enforcing
the
fiduciary
duties
of
labor
union
officials.
after
some
prior
disclosures,
congress
came
--
became
concerned
about
the
question
whether
there
should
not
be
enacted
federal
legislation
which
would
prevent
the
labor
union
leaders
from
abusing
the
power
which
they
had
obtained
largely
by
virtue
of
federal
legislation
such
as
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
taft-hartley
amendments.
the
extent
to
which
there
were
criminal
activities
or
other
improper
practices
plainly
would
bear
upon
the
need
for
such
legislation,
and
in
understanding
of
the
way
in
which
such
practices
were
carried
on
would
certainly
be
very
helpful
in
framing
a
precise
remedy
in
drafting
the
terms
of
the
legislation,
deciding
which
solutions
to
follow
and
which
to
reject.
colonel
wiener
says
that
there
is
no
legislative
practice
because
the
resolution
authorized
the
committee
to
investigate
criminal
activities.
now
first
may
i
say
that
if
his
interpretation
of
criminal
activity
as
applied
to
--
applies
only
to
violations
of
federal
law,
then
of
course
the
committee
was
not
functioning
under
that
part
of
the
resolution
in
this
case.
it
was
functioning
under
the
part
of
the
resolution
that
authorized
it
to
investigate
other
improper
activities.
it
would
draw
its
authority
from
there,
but
i
think
this
assumption
is
quite
wrong
if
this
context,
the
word
“criminal”
applies
to
criminal
or
other
improper
activities
is
not
so
precise,
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
plain
that
it
applies
to
federal
crimes
and
state
crimes
equally.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
would
be
limited
to
crimes
committed
by
a
labor
unions
whose
activities
could
be
said
to
affect
interstate
commerce
so
that
they
were
exercising
or
might
have
been
exercising
a
power
which
was
the
result
of
the
federal
legislation,
giving
unions
properly
so,
a
certain
status
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
taft-hartley
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
i
think
i
spoke
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
sir,
i
can't
imagine
that
it
had
anything
to
do
directly.
but,
if
the
--
if
the
suspected
facts
are
true
to
with
that
the
president
of
the
carpenters
union
used
union
funds
to
bribe
the
prosecutor,
then
he
was
using
union
funds
collected
from
members
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
if
union
influence
was
used
by
hutcheson
or
sawochka,
the
lake
county
teamsters
or
by
hoffa,
that
they
were
using
influence
accumulated
in
large
part
as
a
result
of
their
status
as
the
head
of
unions
are
protected
and
given
the
legal
status
under
federal
legislation
because
the
activities
of
the
unions
affected
interstate
commerce.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
no.
no,
i
--
i
certainly
didn't
mean
to
mr.
justice
black.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
the
committee
could
investigate
these
criminal
activities
for
the
purpose
in
which
it
was
instructed
to
investigate,
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
they
were
to
the
detriment
of
the
interest
of
the
public
and
then,
and
most
necessarily,
to
determine
whether
any
changes
are
required
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states
in
order
to
protect
such
interest
against
the
occurrence
of
such
practices
or
activity.
it
--
the
investigation,
of
course,
must
look
forward
and
did
look
forward
i
think
because
i
tried
--
for
the
reasons
i
tried
to
explain
to
the
enactment
of
federal
legislation,
which
would
be
broadly
limited
within
the
confines
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
it
didn't
deal
with
any
aspect
of
any
improper
activity
of
any
kind.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
1959.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they
--
they
fall
into
three
major
--
four
major
groups.
i'm
afraid
i
may
think
of
others
while
we're
talking
but
the
first
one
secures
certain
rights
of
individual
members
within
the
union
with
respect
to
participation
in
elections,
taking
part
in
meetings
and
so
on.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
internal
affairs.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
second
part
deals
with
the
management
and
accounting
of
union
funds
and
of
course
if
i
may
interrupt
for
just
a
second,
that
is
the
kind
of
legislation
to
which
this
sort
of
investigation
was
highly
relevant
because
knowing
how
the
funds
have
gotten
out
of
the
union
and
into
improper
hands
was
exceedingly
important
in
drafting
that
legislation,
(inaudible)
one
detailed
here
the
money,
it
was
said,
went
through
a
series
of
inter
union
transaction.
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
any
knowledge
about
the
mcclellan
committee,
but
i
don't
think
any
other
incident
of
that
kind
had
come
to
light,
and
in
drafting
the
sections
dealing
with
the
accounting
for
union
funds,
this
sort
of
thing
would
be
very
important
in
knowing
just
what
provisions
that
you
should
put
in.
the
third
major
area
of
the
1959
legislation
deals
with
receiverships
and
union
elections.
this
would
not
be
particularly
important
to
that
and
the
fourth
deals
--
the
fourth
put
certain
restrictions
upon
union
conduct
in
relation
to
organizing
activities
and
labor
disputes.
and
of
course,
this
sort
of
investigation,
according
to
some
person
--
people's
reasoning
was
very
pertinent
there,
because
one
of
the
theories
which
was
advocated
before
the
congress,
i
don't
personally
agree
with
it,
but
one
of
the
theories
was
that
the
unions
are
abusing
this
power
through
this
kind
of
activity
in
lake
county
as
the
way
to
prevent
them
from
doing
it
is
to
destroy
the
source
of
the
power,
that
is
to
say,
take
away
some
of
the
protection
they
have
under
the
wagner
act
and
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
as
i
say,
that
was
not
adapted
to
any
considerably
impairment
by
the
congress,
but
it
certainly
in
terms
of
relevance,
helped
to
make
this
material.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
provisions
in
the
1959
act.
i
don't
recall
the
details
of
which
prohibit
those
convicted
of
certain
crimes
from
holding
union
office
for
a
period,
i
think
it's
five
years
unless
the
secretary
of
labor
--
this
in
exculpatory
clause,
i
forget
just
how
it
reads.
it
seems
to
me
to
pick
up
and
thread
again
that
this
investigation
was
plainly
relevant
to
the
authorized
subject
of
the
committee's
investigations
and
that
the
committee's
resolution
which
instructed
it
to
investigate
criminal
activities
and
other
improper
practices
for
the
purpose
of
saying
how
they
injured
the
public,
and
then
to
decide
what
changes
in
federal
laws
were
needed
was
obviously
a
valid
resolution.
now,
i
should
point
out
that
the
relationship
between
the
investigation
of
the
lake
county
transaction
and
the
committee's
legislation
as
set
forth
in
the
governing
resolution
was
plainly
established
in
the
hearings
before
the
petitioner
and
his
associates
were
questioned.
the
first
evidence
of
that
appears
at
page
23
of
the
record.
going
back
to
page
21,
mr.
kennedy,
the
counsel
had
referred
to
the
indiana
highway
scandal,
then
he
referred
to
the
evidence
that
the
committee
had
of
the
alleged
obstruction
of
justice
in
lake
county
and
he
mentioned
some
of
the
detail
and
then
he
said,
“we
are
inquiring
into
the
situation
in
connection
with
the
presentation
before
the
grand
jury
in
lake
county,
indiana.”
the
explicit
mention
of
that
seems
to
me
to
exclude
as
later
events
prove
any
inquiry
into
the
highway
scandal,
any
direct
inquiry
into
the
highway
scandal,
then
he
(inaudible)
inquiring
into
the
intervention
of
certain
union
officials
in
that
matter.
then
the
chairman
anxious
to
make
sure
that
there
was
a
connection
to
the
authorizing
resolutions
then,
is
there
some
information
that
either
union
funds
were
used
in
the
course
of
those
transaction
or
that
the
influence
of
union
--
of
official
positions
of
high
union
officials
was
used
in
connection
with
this
illegal
operation,
and
mr.
kennedy
replied,
“we
have
information
along
both
lines,
mr.
chairman.”
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
page
23
of
the
record,
mr.
justice.
“we
have
information
along
both
lines,
mr.
chairman.
not
only
the
influence,
but
also
in
connection
with
the
expenditure
of
union
funds,”
and
then
skipping
a
few
lines
which
they
discuss
then,
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
chairman
mcclellan
said,
that
is
the
interest
of
this
committee
in
a
transaction
of
this
kind
or
alleged
transaction
of
this
kind,
to
ascertain
again
whether
the
funds
or
dues
money
of
union
members
is
being
misappropriated,
if
properly
spent,
or
whether
officials
of
unions
are
using
their
position
to
intimidate,
coerce,
or
in
any
way
illegally
promote
transactions
in
which
the
public
interest
is
involved.
as
i
suggested
before,
the
extent
to
each
union
funds
were
being
diverted
from
their
proper
purposes
was
clearly
a
proper
subject
of
federal
concern
and
the
way
in
which
it
was
done
would
plainly
be
of
interest
to
the
committee
and
to
other
members
of
the
congress
in
determining
what
kind
of
a
remedy
to
frame.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
the
third
--
mr.
archibald
cox
making
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
this
was
a
matter
of
concern
to
the
legislative
branch.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
don't
need
--
i'm
--
i
don't
--
confess,
i
don't
recall
the
case
mr.
justice,
but
we
don't
need
to
simply
argue
that
it
was
matter
of
federal
concern,
because
here,
it
was
a
matter
of
legislative
concern
under
the
authorizing
resolution
and
was
demonstrably
a
matter
which
would
be
of
the
greatest
help
in
drawing
legislation
that
was
enacted.
this
was
not
a
matter
of
self-hypothetical-interest
on
the
part
of
the
senate.
indeed,
at
the
time
these
hearings
were
going
forward,
a
bill
was
being
--
was
in
the
committee
stage
or
had
been
reported
on
the
floor
but
then
it
was
the
next
session
that
the
legislation
was
adopted.
so
this
was
a
very
real
practical
legislative
concern
to
the
senate
committee.
i
was
afraid
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
question,
maybe
i
haven't
answered
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
three.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'd
--
i
suggest
that
i
have
shown
that
this
was
a
matter
of
appropriate
legislative
concern
as
to
what
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
perhaps
i
understand
now.
at
this
point,
all
i
was
seeking
to
show
was
that
these
inquiries
of
this
subject
were
both
pertinent
to
the
authorized
subject
of
the
resolution.
now,
i
agree
that
i
have
to
go
out
further
and
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
there
was
any
proper
reason
for
which
petitioner
couldn't
answer,
and
i
also
had
to
deal
either
as
a
matter
of
law
or
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
i
should
think
to
do
both
with
the
argument
that
the
committee
really
wasn't
doing
here
what
is
was
pretending
to
do.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
kilbourn
well,
of
course,
i
think
i
have
to
say
--
show
--
i
have
--
i
have
two
things
to
say
ultimately
in
answer
to
what
understand
to
be
the
thrust
of
mr.
justice
black's
question.
first,
that
is
held
in
the
watkins
and
braden
that
if
the
questions
were
pertinent
to
a
subject
of
investigation
authorized
by
the
senate
resolution,
then
the
committee
--
then
the
court
will
not
inquire
into
what
may
have
been
the
actual
motives
of
the
mcclellan
committee.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
specific
compulsion
to
--
by
the
committee
or
the
counsel
for
the
committee
to
answer
those
questions.
he
at
least
accepted
the
claim
to
the
extent
that
he
went
on
to
ask
another
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
the
--
the
asking
of
additional
questions
is
something
which
must
reside
in
the
judgment
of
the
committee
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
suggest
that
up
to
a
point,
it
certainly
must
rely
in
the
judgment
of
the
committee
to
determine
how
far
the
witnesses'
refusal
goes.
these
questions
are
detailed.
they're
somewhat
different.
it
can't
be
assumed,
i
think,
in
the
refusal
to
answer
one
particular
question
that
this
is
a
refusal
to
answer
others.
now
at
some
point
--
at
some
point,
a
question
might
arise
of
whether
asking
additional
question
was
oppressive
and
served
no
useful
purpose.
and
i
would
think
if
a
man
were
indicted
and
sentenced
in
the
25
counts
of
--
for
failing
to
answer
25
questions
in
the
same
investigation
–
(inaudible)
case
on
that
which
i
have
forgotten,
i
think,
then
this
court
might
well
deal
with
it
and
say
there
has
been
only
one
offense.
but
here,
the
petitioner
--
there
was
a
general
verdict
and
there
was
a
single
sentence
of
six
months
imposed
on
all
counts.
this
was
below
the
minimum
--
below
the
maximum
that
might
have
been
imposed
on
anyone
and
it
would
seem
to
me
therefore
that
that
question
is
not
before
us.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
this
record
shows
any
oppression
of
the
petitioner
with
respect
to
his
claim
of
privilege.
no,
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
wouldn't
think
that
the
questions
that
were
put
too
radically
would
be
ground
for
reversing
the
conviction
of
petitioner,
hutcheson.
second,
as
i
read
the
record,
raddock
had
testified
some
in
executive
session,
and
it
seems
to
be
that
the
chairman's
urging
of
him
to
answer
these
questions
and
saying,
“do
you
really
want
to
standup?”
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'd
--
i've
--
i
would
like
--
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
understand
it
mr.
justice,
many
of
the
answers,
i
think
the
chairman
(inaudible)
in
fairness
--
but
many
of
the
--
many
of
the
things
said
by
the
chairman
read
to
mean
equally
consistently
with
an
effort
to
persuade
the
witness
to
give
this
information
even
in
the
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
you
might
change
--
one
might
change
his
mind.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
sir,
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
therefore
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
seem
to
that
a
--
there
was
no
--
certainly
nothing
that
would
vitiate
the
whole
proceeding
in
seeking
to
persuade
him
for
a
brief
period.
there
was
no
holding
him
here
for
hours.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
that
it
could
be
taken
into
account.
i
would
differ
with
your
honor
as
to
have
serious
as
is
here,
and
i
would
also
suggest
that
if
--
if
this
case,
where
the
subject
matter
and
the
actual
question
are
so
plainly
material
to
the
very
thing
that
the
committee
was
authorized
to
do,
to
see
what
changes
in
the
laws
of
united
states
were
necessary,
to
prevent
the
continuation
of
this
kind
practice,
which
was
injuring
employees,
employers,
and
the
public,
that
it
would
take
a
far
stronger
showing
than
there
is
here
to
convict
the
committee
of
any
improper
motive.
now
on
--
as
to
the
question
of
whether
the
committee
had
an
improper
motive
or
whether
that
is
relevant,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
two
things.
first,
it
seems
to
me
as
i
suggested
earlier
that
it
was
clearly
held
in
watkins
and
later
in
braden
that
where
the
inquiries
are
pertinent
to
the
authorized
purposes
of
the
committee
and
would
aid
congress
in
preparing
legislation
in
a
field
of
the
committee's
concern,
federal
concern,
that
in
that
event,
the
court
would
inquire
no
further.
in
watkins,
the
chief
justice
said,
“the
solution
to
our
problem
is
not
to
be
found
in
testing
the
motives
of
committee
members
to
this
purpose,
such
is
not
our
function.”
their
motives
alone
would
not
vitiate
an
investigation
which
had
been
instituted
by
house
of
congress
if
that
assembly's
legislative
purpose
is
being
served,
and
that
the
inves
--
that
the
facts
sought
to
be
obtained
here
would
serve
the
committee's
legislative
purpose
and
that
it
was
a
legislative
purpose,
seem
to
me
to
be
really
beyond
any
doubt.
furthermore,
this
case,
although
it
really
isn't
necessary
to
go
further,
i
think
fairness
to
the
committee
requires
me
to
point
out
that
the
record
does
not
support
the
attack
which
petitioner
makes
on
the
petition
--
on
the
committee's
motives.
most
of
his
argument
is
centered
about
a
statement
made
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee
which
appears
at
page
152
of
the
record,
begins
way
down
at
the
bottom.
at
this
stage,
the
committee
had
just
completed
this
phase
of
its
investigation,
says
--
say
it
apparently
did
not
contemplate
any
further
inquiry
into
the
management
of
the
carpenters
union
funds
or
into
the
alleged
obstruction
of
justice
in
lake
county.
the
chairman
stated
first
certain
conclusions
which
he
drew
from
the
evidence.
it
seems
that
at
the
very
least,
mr.
hutcheson
is
president
of
the
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters
and
joiners
was
grossly
careless
with
the
use
of
union
funds
and
completely
failed
to
meet
the
responsibility
as
president.
this
was
certainly
an
authorized
subject
of
investigation.
then
he
goes
on
at
some
length
to
describe
the
evidence
which
had
been
introduced
about
this
biography
and
about
raddock's
activities
on
behalf
of
the
union.
and
then
he
said
coming
down,
it's
really
quite
a
minor
thing
in
the
statement,
testimony
further
indicates
that
certain
high
officials
of
both
the
teamsters
and
carpenters
union,
two
of
the
largest
unions
in
the
country,
with
the
help
and
assistance
of
mr.
raddock,
were
involved
in
a
conspiracy
to
subvert
justice
in
the
state
of
indiana.
he
does
state
there
what
conclusions,
he
as
a
member
of
the
senate,
came
to
after
hearing
the
testimony.
but
i
find
nothing
improper
or
nothing
that
would
at
least
--
that
would
justify
the
court
in
refusing
to
force
--
to
punish
a
witness
for
contempt,
if
he
was
guilty
of
contempt,
is
the
fact
that
a
member
of
the
senate
committee
publicly
stated
what
conclusions
he
had
drawn
from
the
testimony.
neither
does
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
fact
that
he
stated
what
conclusions
he
had
drawn
is
enough
to
convict
him
of
some
improper
purpose
in
answering
the
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
think
that
if
one
had
the
case
where
it
were
conceded
that
a
committee
engaged
in
exposure
for
exposure's
sake,
then
what
would
not
to
left
this
because
the
concession
would
have
been
made.
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
disclaim
any
such
argument
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
that
exposure
for
exposure's
sake
can
be
done
by
the
committee.
i
say
two
things.
in
answer
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
say
two
things
in
answer
to
the
charge
that
this
was
exposure
for
exposures
sake.
i
say
first
that
it
is
clear
here
that
these
inquires
were
pertinent
to
an
authorized
subject
of
the
committee's
on
the
--
so
defined
in
the
committee's
resolution
and
that
they
were
--
this
was
in
fact
evident
which
would
aid
the
committee
and
the
congress
in
the
formulation
of
legislation.
but
i
say
that
where
that
is
established,
that
the
court
held
through
the
chief
justice
in
watkins,
that
the
court
would
not
inquire
further
into
the
committee's
motives
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then
we
--
i
want
to
repeat
one
thing
if
i
may,
and
then
i'll
try
to
deal
directly
with
your
observation.
but
first,
i
understand
watkins,
and
i
do
stand
on
this
proposition
to
say
that
if
the
inquiries
are
in
fact
pertinent,
then
this
court
won't
start
probing
the
minds
of
the
committee
to
find
out
what
they
thought
they
were
doing
but
that's
the
subject
that
is
shut
off.
now,
without
waiving
that
point,
i
say
second
that
here,
i
submit
that
on
this
record,
even
if
the
court
made
the
inquiry.
there
was
no
basis
for
concluding
that
this
committee
was
engaged
in
exposure
for
exposure's
sake.
now
your
honor,
puts
to
be
the
case
dealing
with
the
second
question
of
facts
as
i
understood
it.
suppose
that
the
committee
called
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
pert
--
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
what
i
was
going
to
say
if
i
may
skip
the
intervening
steps
is
that
there's
nothing
here
in
my
judgment
to
the
suggestion
that
the
committee
already
had
all
the
information
that
it
needed
about
this
lake
county
transaction.
there's
really
no
basis
for
that
for
several
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
there
was
never
any
evidence
brought
out
which
revealed
all
the
details
of
this
lake
county
transaction.
it
--
there
was
certain
amount
that
was
enough
to
convince
the
committee
there
was
something
phony
about
it,
but
the
way
it
was
done,
how
it
was
accomplished,
the
facts
of
the
inter-union
transaction,
which
could
be
plainly
helpful,
very
helpful
in
drawing
legislation,
never
were
detailed.
in
the
second
place,
surely,
it
is
within
limits
of
discretion,
i
concede
for
the
sake
of
argument,
surely
up
to
the
committee
to
make
up
its
mind
when
evidence
becomes
cumulative
and
it
needs
no
more.
it's
not,
i
think,
a
proper
exercise
for
the
--
of
the
judicial
function
for
the
court
to
say,
“what
we've
looked
at
this
and
we
really
don't
think
you
needed
to
find
anything
more
in
order
to
frame
legislation.”
that
certainly
within
broad
limit
is
a
function
for
the
congressional
committee.
and
however
narrow
those
limits
are
i
submit
that
the
committee
had
not
gone
beyond
here
and
that
no
one
reading
this
record
could
suppose
that
the
committee
had
all
the
information
that
would
be
helpful
bearing
upon
the
way
this
lake
county
investigation
was
fixed,
if
it
was
fixed,
which
i
only
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
argument.
similarly,
it
seems
to
be
that
there's
a
very
little
to
the
argument,
it
did
nothing
to
the
argument,
that
colonel
wiener
makes
based
on
mr.
mcclellan's
testimony
before
the
judge
at
the
trial
of
this
case.
the
testimony
is
on
page
153
of
the
record.
he
was
called
to
explain
this
statement
that
we
--
excuse
me,
i
got
the
wrong
reference,
165
of
the
record,
he
was
called
to
explain
the
statement
that
was
put
out
at
the
end
of
the
--
at
the
end
of
the
hearing,
the
senate
hearing.
and
he
said,
“this
was
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearings
in
this
particular
investigation.”
at
the
conclusion,
i
made
this
brief
statement
which
is
in
the
record.
“our
legislative
function
had
been
performed
in
seeking
information
regarding
crimes
and
improper
activities.
now,
there
i
think
what
he
is
saying
is
that
they
in
relation
to
the
lake
county
investigation,
in
relation
to
drawing
the
facts
about
the
lake
county
investigation,
they
were
done,
but
i
think
in
stretching
that
to
say
that
that
impliedly
excludes
any
purpose
to
use
the
information
later,
in
drafting
legislation
where
the
committee
was
specifically
charged
with
the
duty
of
drafting
legislation.
what
he's
saying
in
effect
is
our
legislative
function,
in
relation
to
this
lake
country
transaction,
in
relation
to
investigating
was
over.
we've
got
no
(inaudible)
about
it.
so
then,
since
there
was
some
evidence
that
a
state
crime
had
been
committed,
it's
our
practice
to
cooperate
with
the
state
officials.
so
what
i
was
saying
was,
my
statement
is
to
the
effect
that
if
the
state
officials
desired
to
pursue
any
testimony
that
we
had
developed,
we'd
cooperate
and
make
the
record
available.
now
i
suggest
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
indiana
case
was
tried
in
1960.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
appearance
before
the
congressional
committee
was
in
1959.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
it
preceded
the
trial
of
the
indiana
indictment.
i
may
say
that
although
certain
preliminary
motions
remained
with
respect
to
the
indiana
indictment,
that
--
that
at
the
trial,
there
was
no
reference
whatsoever
to
the
senate
committee
hearing
and
now,
i've
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
try
the
state
our
position
with
respect
to
the
question
of
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
preceded
the
trial
of
the
marion
county
indictment
which
i
think
came
in
the
summer
or
early
fall
of
1960.
i
said
earlier
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
think
a
fair
way
to
state
the
question
of
law
that
this
case
raises
is
this.
we
have
on
the
one
hand,
this
highway
scandal
which
was
a
separate
transaction
on
the
indictment
concerning
it,
raised
many
issues
of
fact,
all
of
which
were
carefully
avoided
by
the
committee.
we
also
have
another
transaction,
the
lake
county
obstruction
of
justice
or
the
alleged
case.
now,
the
committee's
questions
did
--
there
was
a
relation
between
them,
sort
of
a
nexus,
if
you
will,
between
these
two
quite
different
things.
and
the
committee
asked
questions
only
about
the
lake
county
transaction.
but
it
is
true
as
i
sought
to
say
that
the
answers
to
those
questions
might
have
revealed
a
consciousness
of
guilt,
and
therefore,
might
have
borne
over
on
the
trial
of
the
marion
county
indictment.
and
the
question
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what
is
that
admissible
enough?
now,
the
question
is
--
we're
given
--
whether
given
those
facts,
the
committee
could
constitutionally
put
the
questions
to
the
witness
which
were
pertinent
to
its
investigation
and
tell
him
either
to
answer
or
claim
the
privilege
of
self
--
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
we
say
that
the
right
to
put
the
questions
under
these
circumstances
is
perfectly
plain.
they
were
pertinent
questions
and
that
the
fact
that
the
answers
might
possibly
affect
the
trial
in
the
state
indictment
does
not
forbid
the
committee
to
put
the
question
that
the
way
for
the
witness
to
protect
himself
is
to
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
we
say,
second,
that
in
this
case,
for
reasons
i
sought
to
state
to
the
chief
justice
earlier,
that
we
think
the
privilege
plainly
would
have
been
allowed.
perhaps
it
didn't
have
to
be,
but
it
was
allowed
in
the
case
of
four
other
witnesses
who
were
understood
to
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
that's
the
slightest
reason
to
think
that
if
the
petitioner
had
not
disclaimed
the
privilege,
it
would
have
been
allowed
here.
in
any
event,
since
petitioner
disavowed
it,
he
could
hardly
be
heard
to
say
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
allowed
if
he
had
made
the
claim.
there
could
have
been,
we
submit,
no
--
or
let
me
put
it
this
way,
that
the
dilemma
that
colonel
wiener
says
the
petitioner
faced,
where
his
answers
would
be
used
against
him
in
the
indiana
case
or
his
pleading
the
privilege
would
be
used
against
him
in
the
indiana
case
is
unreal.
in
the
first
place,
the
privilege
he
did
claim
would
be
allowed.
surely
it
would
be
the
basis
for
his
many
adverse
inferences
against
him
as
a
claim
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
second,
we
think
is
the
slochower
case,
although
it
can
be
distinguished
on
the
fact,
in
effect
prohibits
drawing
adverse
consequences
from
a
federal
claim
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
twining
and
adamson
against
california
have
nothing
to
do
with
it,
because
and
the
indiana
(inaudible)
case
has
a
little
to
do
with
it,
because
those
are
all
about
the
effect
of
a
state
claim
of
privilege
in
a
state
proceeding.
and
finally
we
say,
with
respect
to
this
point,
that
any
basic
unfairness,
if
there
was
any,
despite
what
i
have
said,
should
have
been
raised
in
the
indiana
case,
but
at
this
point,
it's
entirely
hypothetical.
petitioner
might
or
might
not
have
taken
the
stand.
the
fact
that
he
claimed
the
privilege
might
or
might
not
have
been
invoked
against
the
prosecutors
or
when
the
prosecutor
attempted
to
invoke
it,
then
and
there
was
the
time
for
him
to
claim
the
prejudice.
and
if
there
was
any
basic
unfairness,
of
course,
he
could
have
brought
the
case
to
this
court.
and
if
there
was
no
basic
unfairness,
it
certainly
isn't
any
greater
--
in
this
case,
what
is
hypothetical
and
potential,
that
it
would
be
in
that
case
if
it
were
accurate.
so,
what
the
case
boils
down
to
is,
i
submit,
that
petitioner
is
asserting
that
although
he
disclaimed
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
the
fifth
amendment
gives
him
a
right
to
obtain
the
same
protection
under
another
name.
and
we
think
that
that
falls
of
its
own
weight
and
indeed
it's
inconsistent
with
the
view
that
one
must
claim
the
privilege,
that
it's
not
a
right
not
to
be
asked
a
question.
and
finally,
that
the
introduction
of
such
a
doctrine,
such
reading
this
into
the
vaguer
parts
of
the
fifth
amendment,
when
the
fifth
man
is
already
adequately
protected
by
the
specific
guarantee,
would
simply
create
confusion,
and
put
a
looseness
into
the
fifth
amendment
which
fortunately
now
is
absent
so
far
as
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
concerned.
