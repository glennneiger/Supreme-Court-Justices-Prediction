mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
essential
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
congressional
committee
in
the
course
of
pre-trying
state
criminal
matters
may
force
a
witness
to
invoke
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination
on
pain
of
going
to
jail
for
contempt
of
congress,
if
the
he
rests
his
refusal
on
the
due
process
clause.
more
specifically,
when
the
petitioner
was
called
as
a
witness,
he
was
then
under
state
indictment.
the
committee
said
it
would
not
question
him
regarding
the
subject
matter
of
that
state
indictment.
it
then
asked
him
questions,
affirmative
answers
to
which
would
have
been
admissible
at
the
trial
of
that
indictment
and
he
refused
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
it
would
aid
the
prosecution
unless
be
in
denial
of
due
process
of
law,
and
he
was
asked
whether
he
claimed
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
he
said
no
and
he
was
asked
whether
he
contented
the
due
process
included
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
he
said
he
didn't
know
the
answer.
now,
the
prosecution
says
here
that
if
he
had
invoked
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
he
would
be
in
the
clear,
but
since
he
rested
his
refusal
on
a
--
an
asserted
denial
of
due
process
of
law,
he
must
go
to
jail.
let
me
now
state
the
facts
in
greater
detail.
when
this
petitioner
was
called
as
a
witness,
he
had
--
he
was
under
indictment,
returned
in
the
state
of
indiana,
the
first
count
charging
a
conspiracy,
the
second
count
alleging
bribery.
the
dates
of
the
acts
alleged
in
the
indictment
were
1956.
the
indictment
was
returned
in
marion
county,
indiana
in
1958.
the
committee
said
specifically
that
they
would
not
inquire
into
the
subject
matter
of
the
marion
county
indictment,
but
the
committee
did
inquire
about
matters
between
the
date
that
the
indictment
was
returned,
and
the
date
of
the
acts
alleged
in
the
indictment,
namely,
allegedly
improper
efforts
in
1957
to
head-off
an
indictment
in
lake
county.
now,
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry,
as
stated
by
counsel
for
the
committee
was
this,
page
23
of
the
record,
top
of
the
page,
“we
are
inquiring
into
the
situation
in
connection
with
the
presentation
before
the
grand
jury
in
lake
county,
indiana;
the
intervention
by
certain
union
officials
into
that
matter,
and
the
part
that
was
played
by
mr.
hutcheson
himself,”
that's
this
petitioner,
“mr.
sawochka,
the
secretary-treasurer
of
local
142
of
the
teamsters,
and
mr.
james
hoffa,
the
international
president
of
the
teamsters.”
there
is
a
writ
--
an
issue
here
which
i
will
deal
with
later
in
detail
as
to
whether
there
was
any
relation
between
this
inquiry
and
the
indictment
as
i
will
indicate
the
prosecution
now
concedes
such
a
relationship.
following
the
background
state
that
i
have
quoted,
four
witnesses
were
called
and
--
to
testify
about
the
lake
county
activities.
three
claimed
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
one
claimed
the
attorney-client
privilege.
all
those
claims
were
respected.
thereupon,
the
committee
called
a
man
named
blaier,
who
was
a
codefendant
with
petitioner
in
the
marion
county
indictment,
and
when
they
asked
him
about
the
lake
county
matters,
he
refused
because
it
might
aid
the
prosecution
in
the
case
in
which
i
am
under
indictment
and
he
was
permitted
to
go
on
his
way.
he
was
the
second
general
vice
president
of
the
carpenters
union,
the
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters
and
joiners
of
america.
and
then
they
called
the
petitioner,
who
is
the
general
president,
and
he
was
asked
about
the
lake
county
transactions,
he
also
refused
to
answer,
but
his
ground
for
refusing
is
on
pages
122
or
123
of
the
transcript
was
this.
“it
relates
or
might
be
claimed
to
relate
to
or
aid
the
prosecution
of
the
case
in
which
i
am
under
indictment
and
thus
be
in
denial
of
due
process
of
law.”
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
there
are
only
two
differences,
this
petitioner
added
in
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
now,
there
may
also
have
been
a
difference,
he
was
the
president
and
the
other
fellow
was
the
second
vice-president.
now,
when
he
stated
this
quoted
ground
for
refusal,
he
was
asked,
“do
you
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?”
“no,”
and
he
disclaimed
that
consistently
and
then
he
was
asked,
“do
you
contend
that
due
process
includes
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?”
he
said,
“that's
a
legal
question,
i'm
not
qualified
to
answer
it.”
they
didn't
ask
him
further.
they
didn't
ask
his
counsel
who
was
present
for
elucidation,
but
unlike
blaier
who
was
permitted
to
go
on
his
way,
this
petitioner
was
directed
to
answer
and
when
on
18
separate
occasions
he
refused
to
answer,
he
was
cited
for
contempt
and
this
prosecution
followed.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
they
were,
your
honor.
at
the
close
of
petitioner's
testimony,
the
committee
chairman
made
this
statement,
pages
153
and
154
of
the
record,
"the
testimony
further
indicates
that
certain
high
officials
of
both
the
teamsters
and
the
carpenters
unions,
two
of
the
largest
unions
in
the
country,
with
the
help
and
assistance
of
mr.
raddock
were
involved
in
a
conspiracy
to
subvert
justice
in
the
state
of
indiana.
all
the
facts
regarding
this
conspiracy
undoubtedly
have
not
been
developed
by
the
committee.
further
exposure
we
believe
can
and
should
be
made.
we
will
be
glad
to
assist
and
help
law
enforcement
officials
in
the
state
of
indiana
if
they
determine
that
they
would
interest
themselves
in
the
matter."
now
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
was
part
of
the
hearing.
it
was
at
the
close
of
petitioner's
testimony.
this
statement
was
read.
then
at
petitioner's
trial,
the
committee
chairman
was
called
as
a
prosecution
witness
to
explain
the
statement.
and
in
the
course
of
his
sworn
testimony
at
this
trial
for
contempt
of
congress
he
said,
“our
legislative
purpose
is
to
search
out
and
find
if
crime
has
been
committed.”
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
at
page
165
of
the
record.
petitioner
was
tried
without
a
jury
and
the
judge
convicted
him
on
the
ground,
the
stated
ground,
record
174,
that
the
only
recourse
he
had
for
not
answering
questions
put
by
the
committee
was
to
invoke
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
the
prosecution
now
says
that
if
he
had
invoked
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
he
would
in
the
clear,
but
that
since
he
rested
his
refusal
to
answer
on
an
asserted
denial
of
due
process
of
law,
he's
got
to
go
to
jail
for
six
months.
now,
this
morning
here,
if
the
court
please,
i
propose
to
discuss
three
basic
propositions.
the
first,
that
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
for
a
legislative
committee
to
pre-try
a
criminal
case.
the
second,
that
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
to
force
a
party
to
make
a
discovery
that
would
expose
him
to
penalties,
and
the
third,
that
the
questions
now
under
consideration
were
not
asked
in
pursuance
of
any
legitimate
legislative
purpose,
but
before
i
can
get
to
those
three
basic
propositions,
i
must
pause
to
dispose
of
two
preliminaries.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
possibly
so.
it
could
be
disposed
off
on
that
ground.
but
before
i
get
to
either
of
the
three,
i've
got
to
deal
with
two
preliminaries,
and
the
first
preliminary
is
the
relationship
between
the
marion
county
indictment
alleging
acts
in
1956,
and
the
lake
county
transactions
supposed
to
have
taken
place
in
1957.
and
the
relationship
is
this,
that
as
a
matter
of
indiana
law,
any
improper
effort
to
head-off
or
discourage
or
stop
or
quash
a
prosecution
is
admissible
as
evidence
of
consciousness
of
(voice
overlap)
of
the
substantive
offense
and
the
prosecution,
in
their
brief
here,
concede
that
affirmative
answers
to
the
questions
about
the
lake
county
activities
which
they
referred
to
succinctly,
if
somewhat
inelegantly,
as
the
attempt
to
fix,
would
be
admissible
at
--
would've
been
admissible
at
the
trial
of
the
marion
county
indictment.
this
is
actually
the
most
significant
con
--
concession
because
the
record
shows
that
petitioner's
counsel
tried
diligently
and
persistently
to
demonstrate
to
the
committee
the
relationship
between
these
questions
they
were
asking
and
the
pending
indictment.
the
committee
seems
to
have
been
completely
hypnotized
by
the
chronology.
these
were
questions
about
matters
occurring
in
1957,
the
last
acts
alleged
in
the
indictment
were
in
1956.
how
could
there
be
any
relationship,
but
under
the
indiana
rule,
there
is
a
relationship
and
the
parties
agree.
now
the
second
preliminary
point
is
that
penalties
and
disadvantages
would
have
accrued
to
this
petitioner
if
as
the
prosecution
now
says
he
might
have
done,
if
he
had
invoked
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
turn
--
in
terms,
and
that
would
have
been
involved
three
demonstrable
disadvantages.
disadvantage
number
one;
in
the
expressed
view
of
the
committee
chairman
on
this
record,
and
in
the
subsequent
committee
report
which
has
been
incorporated
by
reference
into
this
record,
it
would
be
perfectly
--
it's
perfectly
plain
that
any
invocation
by
a
witness
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
treated
as
tantamount
to
an
admission
of
guilt.
now
i'm
familiar
with
the
cases
here
that
say
otherwise,
but
this
was
according
to
that
branch
of
the
government,
they
had
their
own
views.
if
anybody
invoked
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
before
them,
that
proved
his
guilt.
second
disadvantage,
if
petitioner
had
invoked
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
there
would
have
been
a
problem
concerning
his
continued
tenure
of
his
union
office
in
view
of
the
afl-cio
code.
now
the
precise
terms
of
that
code
are
not
in
evidence
and
not
part
of
the
record,
but
petitioner
admitted
in
response
to
questions
by
a
member
of
the
committee
that
he
was
concerned
about
it.
and
the
third
disadvantage
that
petitioner
would
have
incurred
if
he
had
invoked
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
this,
that
if
at
the
impending
indiana
trial,
he
had
taken
the
stand
as
a
witness,
any
prior
claim
of
privilege
on
his
part
regarding
the
same
subject
matter
could
have
been
made
the
subject
of
prosecution
comment
against
him.
that's
perfectly
plain
as
the
matter
of
indiana
law.
now
the
prosecution
says
indiana
couldn't
constitutionally
do
that,
and
they
cite
the
slochower
case,
in
the
350
united
states.
i
don't
think
the
slochower
case
says
anything
to
that
effect.
after
all,
the
cases
of
twining
against
new
jersey
and
adamson
against
california
are
still
law.
they
were
reaffirmed
only
last
term
in
cohen
against
hurley.
and
they
say
that
where
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
doesn't
take
the
stand
at
all,
the
prosecution
can
comment
on
it.
that
is
not
so
in
indiana.
if
an
indiana
criminal
defendant
does
not
testify,
that
fact
cannot
be
commented
on.
but
if
an
indiana
defendant
does
testify,
then
the
prosecution
may
use
the
fact
that
on
some
previous
occasion
he
has
claimed
his
privilege
with
respect
to
the
questions
being
asked.
so
that
at
the
very
least,
if
he
had
--
if
petitioner
had
before
the
present
committee
claimed
--
done
what
the
prosecution
says
he
should
have
done
in
order
to
be
in
the
clear
in
respect
of
contempt
of
congress,
he
would
have
hurt
himself
at
the
indiana
trial
if
he
had
taken
the
stand,
and
at
the
very
least,
he
would
have
circumscribed
his
freedom
of
action
at
that
trial.
and
now,
with
these
two
preliminaries
out
of
the
way,
i
come
to
the
first
proposition
that
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law
for
a
legislative
committee
to
pre-try
criminal
cases,
and
the
first
issue
between
the
parties
here
is
was
there
any
pretrial
in
fact?
and
we
say
the
committee
was
all
too
obviously
pre-trying
a
potential
criminal
case
in
its
entirety,
namely,
the
alleged
obstruction
of
justice
in
lake
county,
indiana.
now
that
pros
--
that
pretrial
started
with
an
accusation,
namely
the
background
statement
by
the
committee
counsel
which
i
have
already
quoted
and
then
that
pretrial
ended
with
a
verdict
by
the
committee
chairman.
the
testimony
further
indicates
that
certain
high
officials
evoked
the
teamsters
and
the
carpenters
union,
with
the
help
and
the
assistance
of
mr.
raddock,
were
involved
in
the
conspiracy
to
subvert
justice
in
the
state
of
indiana.
and
then
finally,
there
was
a
formal
judgment
of
conviction
entered
by
that
verdict
in
the
committee
report.
in
one
of
its
findings,
its
--
i'm
reading
from
page
26
of
petitioner's
brief,
one
of
the
committee's
findings
was
from
the
evidence
the
committee
also
finds
that
maxwell
c.
raddock
was
used
by
hutcheson
as
a
fixer
in
an
attempt
to
head-off
the
indictment
of
hutcheson,
the
carpenters
vice
president,
o.
william
blaier
and
the
treasurer,
frank
chapman.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
at
page
26
of
petitioner's
brief.
it
is
pro
--
a
quotation
from
page
590
of
the
committee's
interim
report
which
was
incorporated
by
reference
into
the
record.
it's
at
page
26
of
the
blue
brief.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
correct
and
the
--
and
the
asserted
conspiracy
to
obstruct
justice
was
the
effort
to
head-off
in
1957
an
indictment
in
the
lake
county
for
these
lands
frauds,
and
that
the
indictment
was
returned
about
six
months
later
in
the
adjoining
county
of
marion.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
on
the
substantive
charges.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
substantive
charges
were
conspiracy
and
bribery
in
connection
with
a
highway
method
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
obstruction
of
justice
was
the
effort
to
--
alleged
efforts
to
head-off
indictment
for
that
offense
in
lake
county.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
there
was
not,
but
bribery
which
according
to
the
committee's
report
was
involved,
bribery
is
a
crime
in
indiana.
conspiracy
is
a
crime
in
indiana.
compounding
a
felony
is
a
crime
in
indiana.
compounding
a
prosecution
is
a
crime
in
indiana.
so
that
if
--
what
this
committee
did
wasn't
the
pretrial
of
a
potential
criminal
case,
then
i
don't
know
what
pretrial
is.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
and
i
will
--
i
will
at
the
third
point
which
--
now,
two
members
of
the
court
think
i'm
taking
up
out
of
order.
i
will
discuss
that
and
say
that
that
is
not
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose
to
find
out
whether
the
crime,
i.e.
the
violation
of
existing
law
has
been
committed.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
an
attack
on
the
resolution.
yes,
your
honor.
but
it
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
it
has
been
tried.
it
is
now
on
appeal.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
my
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
correct.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly
and
to
that
extent,
they
were
pre-trying
the
pending
criminal
case
because
there's
a
common
ground
between
the
parties
that
affirmative
answers,
any
of
these
questions
as
to
the
alleged
lake
county
activities
would
have
gone
in
at
the
marion
county
trial,
and
therefore,
to
that
extent,
if
there
was
a
pretrial
of
a
pending
criminal
case,
and
when
the
prosecution
says,
page
40
of
united
states'
brief,
“it
distorts
the
record
to
say
that
the
committee
attempted
to
pre-try
a
criminal
case,”
i
submit
that
if
there's
any
distortion,
it
is
not
on
the
part
of
petitioner
or
his
counsel.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
finding
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i'm
pretty
sure
it
was
before,
your
honor,
let
me
just
check.
i
have
it
here.
the
committee's
second
interim
report
ordered
to
be
printed
october
23,
1959,
and
my
information
is
the
petitioner
wasn't
tried
on
that
indictment
until
sometime
in
1960.
so
that
it
preceded
--
it
preceded
the
trial.
now,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
public
prejudice
arising
out
of
the
pretrial
of
criminal
cases
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
serious
problems
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
today.
it
appears
mostly
of
course
as
trial
by
newspaper.
only
at
the
last
term,
two
cases,
on
consecutive
pages
of
this
court's
reports
were
reversed
because
of
trial
by
newspaper.
one
was
the
janko
case,
a
direct
appeal,
the
other
one
was
irvin
v.
dowd,
collateral
attack.
and
some
years
back,
there
was
the
delaney
case
in
the
first
circuit
which
turned
on
a
necessity
for
a
continuance
where
there
had
been
a
legislative
pretrial
of
an
impending
indictment,
but
there,
the
perspective
defendant,
delaney,
was
never
called
by
the
committee.
well,
i
hardly
need
say
that
such
a
legislative
pretrial
is
a
criminal
trial
without
any
safeguards.
the
committee
makes
the
rules.
there
isn't
any
cross-examination.
the
defendant
can't
bring
witnesses
in
support.
it's
a
legislative
trial
with
all
its
evils
culminating
in
this
finding
in
the
committee
report
in
something
that's
certainly
in
substance,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
for
a
legal
point,
but
certainly
in
the
substance
pretty
close
to
a
bill
of
attainder.
now
you've
got
the
same
problem,
if
the
court
please,
in
beck
against
washington
number
40
which
will
be
reached
a
little
later
in
this
same
argument
session
and
which
as
a
matter
of
interest
involves
the
same
legislative
committee.
well,
the
prosecution's
position
on
the
pendency
of
this
indictment
was,
that
is
true,
the
brief
on
opposition
here,
that
the
pendency
of
an
indictment
is
no
bar
to
a
legislative
inquiry
as
to
the
same
subject
matter
citing
the
sinclair
case
in
the
279
united
states.
well,
we
said
now
wait
a
minute.
there
wasn't
any
pending
indictment
in
sinclair.
there
was
a
pending
civil
action.
oh
says
the
prosecution,
"yes,
but
it
was
a
pending
civil
action
with
unmistakable
criminal
overtones
because
a
special
grand
jury
have
been
empanelled."
well
now,
if
the
court
please,
what
is
a
civil
action
with
unmistakable
criminal
overtones?
is
it
a
proceeding
where
if
judgment
goes
for
the
plaintiff,
the
defendant
must
not
only
pay
damages
but
go
to
jail?
there
isn't
any
such
act
and
the
difference,
if
the
court
please,
is
not
one
of
labels,
it's
one
of
substance
and
it's
this.
a
criminal
defendant
cannot
be
compelled
to
testify.
a
cri
--
a
civil
defendant
can
be
compelled
to
testify.
so
we
say
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
to
pre-try
a
pending
criminal
case,
and
we
have
here,
if
the
court
please,
not
newspapers
intent
on
the
crime.
not
newspapers
pandering
to
community
prejudice.
we
have
here
lawlessness
on
the
part
of
the
lawmakers.
a
pre
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
he
did
claim
a
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
he
did.
he
said
it
would
be
in
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
that
is
also
part
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
your
honor.
he
explicitly
disclaimed
reliance
on
the
self-incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
the
committee
recognized
it
as
to
the
other
witnesses.
now,
i
think
it's
speculated,
it's
--
if
in
the
extreme,
to
suppose
that
they
would
have
recognized
it
because
--
on
--
if
he
had
invoked
it,
and
i
say
that
--
and
i
say
that,
because
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
this
petitioner's
ground
for
refusal
was
not
very
different
from
blaier's
and
they
let
blaier
go
free
and
they
--
and
they
cite
--
directed
this
petitioner
to
answer
and
cited
him
for
contempt.
so
that
--
while
the
prosecution
says,
“yes,
they
would
have
let
them
go
free
if
he
had
invoked
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,"
i
say
that's
speculative.
its
weak
speculation
and
it
would
have
involved
the
three
disadvantages
that
i've
outlined.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
the
point
i
am
coming
to
in
a
--
in
great
detail
on
--
on
my
next
point
and
i'm
practically
there.
on
this
point,
the
matter
of
pretrial,
we
--
we
think
that
this
business
of
the
committee
of
congress
pre-trying
a
criminal
case
should
be
discountenanced
once
and
for
all.
there's
only
one
other
instance
that
i
know
of
that's
in
the
reports.
we
hadn't
cited
in
it
our
brief,
its
judge
keech's
granting
of
the
motion
for
acquittal
in
the
icardi
case
in
140
f.supp.
383.
that
was
the
pretrial
of
icardi,
the
alleged
murderer
of
major
holohan,
the
oss
man
in
italy,
that's
only
a
district
court
opinion
we
haven't
cited.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
think
both
are
equally
bad.
i
think
both
are
equally
bad
because
the
place
--
there's
one
--
only
one
place,
if
your
honor
please,
where
a
criminal
case
should
be
tried
and
that's
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
i
don't
say
that.
i
--
i
say
that
basically
here,
there
was
a
pending
indictment.
i
don't
say
for
a
minute
that
a
committee
has
to
bring
its
inquiries
to
a
grinding
halt
whenever
there's
something
that
has
the
smell
of
a
--
of
an
indictable
offense.
but
when
as
here,
they
go
out
deliberately
to
investigate
a
--
an
offense
which
they
know
is
an
offense,
which
they
know
in
advance
is
an
offense,
there,
i
say,
that
is
the
improper
pretrial
procedure.
and
--
and
as
for
the
contention
that
--
well,
this
would
leave
it
open
for
any
state
district
attorney
to
hamper
a
congressional
investigation
simply
by
indicting
people.
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
adams
against
maryland
for
90
years
--
for
90
years,
congress
provided
that
an
answer
given
by
a
witness
before
it
or
one
of
its
committees
would
not
be
admissible
in
any
court,
adams
against
maryland,
347.
once
they
restored
that
provision,
there
is
no
danger.
now,
i
come
to
the
point
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
--
that
is
one
of
my
arguments
which
is
my
third
point.
now,
i'm
on
--
on
the
second.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
and
that
is
that
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
to
force
a
witness
before
a
congressional
committee
to
subject
himself
to
penalties.
now
here
in
this
case,
simply
by
calling
this
petitioner
as
a
witness,
he
was
placed
in
a
quadruple
dilemma
with
penalties
absolutely
unavoidable.
if
he
answered
the
questions
affirmatively,
they
could've
been
used
against
him
at
his
pending
trial.
if
he
answered
them
negatively
and
those
negative
answers
were
false,
he
would
have
been
subject
to
a
prosecution
for
perjury.
if
he
claimed
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
he
was
subject
to
the
three
disadvantages
that
i've
outlined,
and
since
he
refused
to
answer
on
the
grounds
of
due
process
of
law,
he
faces
the
six
months
term
in
jail.
i
ask,
is
it
consistent
with
due
process
of
law
to
place
a
person
in
such
a
dilemma
simply
by
calling
him
as
a
witness.
now
of
course,
if
the
court
please,
i'm
perfectly
aware
that
under
the
rule
of
united
states
against
murdock
in
the
284
united
states,
a
witness
before
a
federal
tribunal
cannot
claim
--
the
state
cannot
claim
danger
of
state
self-incrimination.
the
committee
here,
however,
recognized
the
unfairness
of
that
rule
and
they
said
that
they
wouldn't
inquire
as
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
pending
indictment.
at
page
78
of
the
record,
this
is
--
the
chairman
said,
first
whole
paragraph,
“if
he
feels
that
it
might
jeopardize
his
defense,
we
recognized
that
where
he
is
under
indictment,
he
should
not
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
on
the
subject
matter
involved
in
the
indictment,
that
rule
or
policy
be
observed.”
well,
with
that,
a
good
deal
of
the
murdock
rule
went
out
the
window.
the
difficulty
before
the
committee
was
that
the
committee
wouldn't
recognize
or
couldn't
recognize,
it
was
unable
to
recognize
the
connection
between
these
lake
county
questions
and
the
marion
county
indictment.
here,
the
prosecution
recognizes
that
connection
and
says
he
would
have
been
alright
if
he
had
invoked
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
respect
to
the
lake
county
questions
and
with
that
statement,
if
the
court
please,
a
good
deal
more
of
the
murdock
rule
goes
out
the
window.
now,
moreover,
since
the
committee
here
sought
to
insist
–
or
to
sought
to
assist,
to
encourage
and
indeed
to
exhort
state
law
enforcement
officials
to
pursue
the
subject
matter
of
the
questions
namely
this
alleged
improper
procedure
in
lake
county.
we
have
a
palpable
instance
of
the
improper
use
of
federal
processes
to
compel
disclosure
for
state
purposes,
but
if
that
isn't
enough
then
we
urge
that
this
situation
be
treated
just
as
the
great
chief
justice
treated
a
precisely
similar
situation
in
the
saline
bank
case
in
the
first
appeal
and
chief
justice
marshall
there
said
the
rule
clearly
is
that
a
party
is
not
bound
to
make
any
discovery
which
would
expose
him
to
penalties.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
would
say
it
was
instinct
with
constitutional
by
someone
who
grew
up
with
the
constitution.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
overtones,
undertones,
i
say
precisely
similar
because
in
the
saline
bank
case,
the
united
states
sought
a
money
judgment,
it
was
a
suit
in
equity
because
of
fraud.
it
was
not
federal
law,
but
state
law
that
made
criminal
what
the
defendants
there
had
done.
the
situation
was
one
where
the
danger
of
the
state
penalty
was
actual
and
not
conjectural,
and
that
saline
bank
case
was
followed
as
late
--
as
the
200
united
states,
ballmann
against
fagin.
and
then
in
the
very
next
volume,
in
the
--
in
hale
against
henkel,
it
is
improperly
distinguished
and
palpably
misstated.
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
hale
against
henkel
--
the
saline
bank
case.
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
the
prosecution
was
under
a
state
law
which
imposed
the
penalty,
and
that
the
federal
court
was
simply
administering
the
state
law
and
no
question
arose
as
to
a
prosecution
in
another
jurisdiction.
now
when
i
say
palpably
misstated,
i'm
not
relying
on
dialect.
we've
gone
to
the
archives.
we
have
copied
the
complaint
and
the
interrogatories
in
the
saline
bank
case
from
the
manuscripts
and
printed
them
here
in
our
brief,
and
it's
perfectly
plain
that
saline
bank
never
for
one
minute
held
what
hale
v.
henkel
said
it
did.
there
wasn't
any
prosecution.
the
federal
court
wasn't
administering
state
law.
it
was
simply
suing
on
the
money
claim
of
the
united
states
and
the
only
possible
prosecution
would
have
been
by
the
state
in
a
named
state
court.
so
we
say,
let
us
return
to
the
pristine
federalism
of
chief
justice
marshall.
now,
murdock
also
rests,
in
our
view,
on
some
other
demonstrable
misreadings
of
authorities.
i
think
we've
covered
them
in
the
brief
and
certainly
justice
cardozo's
admonition
was
that
individual
cases
shouldn't
be
dissected
in
open
court
because
it's
a
--
have
to
be
a
gruesome
and
a
wearisome
spectacle
and
i
will
add
--
heed
that
admonition
and
reserve
the
balance
of
murdock
--
of
the
inequities,
the
misreadings
in
murdock
to
the
brief,
unless
if
the
court,
of
course,
any
members
of
the
court
have
questions
because
i
do
not
shrink
from
questions
as
to
that.
at
any
rate,
it
is
significant
that
here,
the
prosecution
does
not
challenge
our
reading
of
the
saline
bank
case.
they
don't
discuss
saline
bank
in
that
text.
they
don't
discuss
saline
bank
in
any
of
their
numerous
footnotes.
they
don't
so
much
as
cite
the
case.
rather
they
say
that
petitioner
lacks
standing
to
attack
the
murdock
rule
because
he
specifically
disclaimed
any
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
to
which
we
say,
"well,
he
never
disclaimed
due
process
of
law",
and
therefore
i
can
discuss
due
process
of
law,
if
not
indeed
till
the
cows
come
home,
not
certainly
until
both
lights
are
on.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
now,
this
court,
of
course,
has
frequently
said
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
include
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
i
don't
suggest
for
a
minute
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
be
read
differently.
but,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
most
of
those
comments
have
been
talked
rather
than
holding.
i
don't
at
the
moment
recall
a
case
where
that
was
said
where
there
was
a
state
indictment
actually
pending
but
this
--
i
should
be
wrong
as
to
that,
it
is
perfectly
plain,
i
think,
that
no
case
on
the
relationship
between
due
process
of
law
and
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
has
ever
considered
the
actual
true
holding
of
the
saline
bank
case.
and
i
don't
suppose
in
view
of
mapp
against
ohio
that
it's
necessary
to
argue
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
have
yet
have
a
completely
fixed
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
content.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
think
it
expresses
a
general
rule
offense
and
it's
--
to
me
very
interesting
in
dealing
with
all
these
contempt
of
congress
cases
that
the
basic
unfairness
of
the
murdock
rule
that
one
sovereignty
can
force
a
person
into
the
jail
of
a
coordinate
sovereignty
is
so
unfair
that
most
of
the
lower
courts'
reading
sometimes
between
the
lines
and
sometimes
the
line
themselves
would
like
to
get
away
from
it
and
i
think
that
is
an
expression.
i
mean,
here
was
a
--
here
was
a
federal
action
by
the
united
states
in
a
federal
court
and
--
and
if
a
rule
of
equity,
if
it's
a
rule
of
equity
rather
than
anything
else,
it
--
it
represents
a
basic
concept
of
fairness
which
after
all
is
what
due
process
is.
and
--
and
certainly
--
certainly
john
marshall
who
seven
volumes,
six
volumes
later
was
to
write
barron
against
baltimore,
certainly,
he
was
under
no
misapprehensions
or
misconceptions
as
to
the
line
between
state
and
federal
power.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
the
delaney
case
was
a
federal
prosecution
and
a
federal
legislative
committee.
and
delaney's
case
had
been
pretty
thoroughly
pre-tried
before
the
committee
without
however
calling
him
as
a
witness.
when
the
case
came
on
for
trial,
his
counsel
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
asked
for
continuance.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
it
was
--
it
was
definitely
on
due
process
ground.
but,
coming
back
here,
i
think
that
the
distinction
that
the
prosecution
makes
that
it
would
have
been
perfectly
alright
if
he
had
invoked
self-incrimination,
but
that
he
goes
to
jail
since
he
invoked
due
process,
seems
to
me
to
tribulize
a
basic
concept
of
fairness
into
a
form
of
words.
now
i
--
i
could
understand
the
prosecution
saying,
“look,
mr.
hutcheson,
you
cannot
claim
state
self-incrimination
at
all.”
that
i
could
understand,
that
at
least
would
be
logical.
then
we'd
be
face-to-face
with
the
unsoundness
of
the
murdock
case
because
it
rested
on
many
misconceptions.
but
to
say
that
you
would
have
been
alright
if
you
pleaded
self-incrimination
but
since
you
put
it
on
the
grounds
of
denial
of
due
process
of
law
take
him
away,
that
i
cannot
see
because
the
--
the
basic
unfairness
here
is
in
calling
the
man
as
a
witness
and
then
forcing
him
to
invoke
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
his
own
determent.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
they
were
repetitive
when
they
put
in
the
guarantee
of
jury
trial
placed.
they
had
in
the
original
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
that
--
i
understand
that.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
think
the
basic
unfairness
here
is
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no.
may
i
--
may
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
unfairness
here
is
by
making
him
--
by
making
him
invoke
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
his
own
detriment,
because
what
the
committee
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
the
answer
here
--
they
--
what
the
committee
did
here
was
to
say
to
the
witness,
“look,
you
either
answer
or
you
plead
your
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
means
to
us
that
you're
guilty,
and
which
will
hurt
you.”
in
other
words
to
--
to
lapse
into
the
inaccurate
jargon
they
--
they
said
answer
or
take
the
fifth
and
because
he
took
a
different
clause
of
the
fifth,
he's
got
six
months
to
serve,
making
little
ones
out
of
bigger
ones.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
think
due
process
includes
--
properly
includes
self-incrimination,
particularly
where
self-incrimination
itself
would
involve
efficiency.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
definitely.
no
question
about
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no
question
about
that.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
unfairness
here
is
to
invoke
self-incrimination
with
itself
be
appended
and
that
brings
me
to
the
question
of
whether
these
--
this
inquiry
dealt
with
any
proper
legislative
purpose
and
there
we
say
no
on
two
grounds.
in
the
first
place,
we
have
here
as
we've
had
in
so
many
other
cases,
the
matter
of
the
chairman
saying
the
purpose
is
exposure.
i'm
aware
of
the
cases
that
say
we
disregard
that
if
the
resolution
is
clear
and
clean.
what
was
the
resolution
here?
page
176;
“to
investigate
the
extent
to
which
criminal
or
other
improper
practices
or
activities
are
or
have
been
engaged,
the
extent
to
which
criminal
or
other
improper
practices
or
activities
are
or
have
been
engaged.”
now,
if
they
investigate
improper
activities,
of
course,
they
can
legislate
and
make
them
criminal,
but
to
investigate
criminal
practices
that
is
a
violation
of
existing
law
and
that's
what
the
chairman
said.
our
legislative
purpose
is
to
search
out
and
find
if
crime
has
been
committed.
well
now,
what
legislative
purpose
is
served
by
any
such
inquiries?
suppose
the
committee
finds
the
crime
has
been
committed,
what
legislation
will
they
pass
in
consequence
of
that
finding?
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
if
criminal
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
criminal
in
that
authorizing
resolution
means
state
criminal
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
then
of
course
the
witness
is
free
to
plead
state
self-incrimination
or
denial
of
state
due
process.
and
i
am
assuming
that
when
a
--
when
a
committee
of
congress
sets
out
to
investigate
criminal
activities,
it
means
--
it
means
federal
criminal
activities.
if
its
goes
beyond
that,
if
the
committee
of
congress
investigates
state
criminal
activities,
then
my
case
is
much
easier
because
then
they
can't
aid
the
prosecution
consistent
with
due
process,
so
it
must
mean
federal
criminal,
and
--
and
we
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
here,
they
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
the
question
here
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
question
here
is
the
state
federal
relationship
as
to
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
protecting
the
witnesses.
well,
if
you
say
your
honor
that
criminally
activities
means
state
criminal
activities
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
then
the
witness
can
say,
“well
look,
if
you're
going
to
investigate
state
criminal
activities,
why
--
i
don't
have
to
answer
questions
that
are
going
to
hurt
me
in
state
criminal
prosecutions.”
so,
all
the
rest
of
murdock
goes
out
the
window
once
you
assume
that
criminal
includes
state
criminal.
now,
i
assumed
that
it
means
federal
criminal,
and
i
submit
that
is
it
is
no
part
--
it
is
not
a
legitimate
legislative
function
to
find
out
whether
crime,
that
is
to
say
the
violation
of
existing
law
has
been
committed.
that
is
the
function
of
the
fbi,
of
grand
juries,
of
law
enforcement
officers,
and
of
u.s.
attorney,
but
there's
a
second
aspect
of
illegitimacy
here.
the
impropriety
of
the
entire
line
of
inquiry
is
shown
by
the
circumstances
that
the
committee
had
the
facts
at
the
beginning.
they
were
set
forth
in
the
background
statement.
and
they
found
the
facts
at
the
end
as
set
forth
in
the
com
--
chairman's
statement
and
is
set
forth
in
the
committee's
report.
so
that
they
didn't
need
this
petitioner's
answers
for
any
fact
finding
purposes.
now
the
prosecution
said
the
petitioner
would
go
free
if
he
claimed
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
that's
simply
emphasizes
and
underscores
that
petitioner's
answers
were
neither
necessary
nor
wanted.
it's
true,
it
would
subject
him
to
the
disadvantages,
but
it
wouldn't
give
the
committee
any
answers.
so
that
what
the
prosecution's
argument
does
is
to
prove
to
a
mathematical
certainty
that
the
committee
wasn't
really
seeking
information.
that
its
only
purpose
was
to
pre-try
a
pending
and
a
potential
criminal
case
and
to
make
this
witness,
who
was
already
under
state
indictment
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
his
own
demonstrable
det
--
detriment.
i
submit
that
at
this
time
to
halt
this
public
badgering
of
witnesses
where
no
legislative
purpose
is
served,
where
no
genuine
fact
finding
is
in
progress.
now
what
they
wanted
from
him,
they
have
the
facts,
they
have
the
facts
without
his
answers.
they
have
the
facts
without
any
of
these
witnesses'
answers
and
they
found
them
as
facts
in
their
report.
they
wanted
him
either
to
admit
guilt
in
terms
through
his
own
mouth
or
to
plead
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
on
their
own
strongly
held,
conscientiously
held
view
was
tantamount
to
an
admission
of
guilt.
in
other
words,
the
only
purpose
was
to
get
them
up
there
and
discredit
him
by
either
making
him
admit
wrongdoing
or
else
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
we
say
it's
about
time
that
the
courts
put
a
stop
to
this
saturnalia
of
exposure
for
exposures
sake.
this
legislative
pretrial
of
criminal
cases,
this
bringing
down
of
penalties
and
disadvantages
on
witnesses'
heads,
penalties
and
disadvantages
that
follow
automatically,
inescapably,
inevitably
simply
from
calling
them
as
witnesses,
and
this
forcing
of
a
witness
to
invoke
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
when
in
the
minds
of
the
committee,
in
the
minds
possibly
of
his
employers,
in
the
minds
of
a
great
segment
of
the
public,
would
involve
a
stigma,
when
they
don't
need
his
answers,
when
they
only
want
him
to
--
ask
him
the
questions
so
he
will
plead
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
i
submit
that
this
kind
of
treatment
of
witnesses,
not
to
get
information
out
of
them,
but
to
make
them
invoke
a
stigma.
and
it
is
a
stigma
whether
rightly
or
wrongly,
this
sort
of
business
does
not
further
any
legitimate
legislative
purpose.
i
submit
it
offends
against
public
decency,
and
therefore
defense
against
the
due
process
clause,
and
therefore
the
questions
work
as
petitioner
rightly
said
in
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
several
witnesses
gave
--
who
were
called
on
this
lake
county
matter
were
not
answering.
first
we
had
raddock.
on
the
advice
of
counsel,
i
refuse
to
answer
the
question
on
the
ground
that
it
may
tend
to
make
me
a
witness
against
myself
and
that
went
on
for
page
after
page
after
page,
beginning
at
about
page
34,
he's
asked
one
question
after
another,
the
same
answer,
the
same
answer,
namely,
that.
second
witness,
sawochka,
on
the
advice
of
a
counsel,
i
respectfully
decline
to
answer
the
question
and
exercise
my
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
not
to
be
a
witness
against
myself.
next
witness
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that's
48,
49,
50,
51,
52,
i'm
reading
from
my
reply
--
petitioners'
reply
brief
at
page
15
where
that's
(inaudible)
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
not
to
be
a
witness
against
myself.
then,
the
third
witness,
“on
the
advice
of
my
counsel,
sir,
i
decline
to
answer
the
question
upon
the
ground
that
my
answer
might
tend
to
incriminate
me.”
fourth
witness
invoked
the
attorney-client
privilege.
then
comes
blaier;
that
it
relates
solely
to
a
personal
matter
not
pertinent
to
any
activity
which
this
committee
is
authorized
to
investigate
and
also
because
it
might
aid
the
prosecution
in
the
case
in
which
i
am
under
indictment.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
see
how
anyone
could
possibly
understand
from
that
even
if
it
were
a
stupid
report
that
he
had
invoked
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
last
is
on
pages
82,
83
to
84,
86.
then,
there
comes
in
his
counsel,
mr.
travis
and
mr.
travis
says
on
page
91
of
the
record,
“it
was
not
mr.
blaier's
intention
is
--
in
his
refusal
as
i
draft
it,”
i
suppose
it's,
“i
drafted
it,”
“to
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment.
i
feel
there
are
other
guarantees
that
a
man
under
indictment
has
including
the
due
process
of
law
clause,
that
he
must
be
tried
only
before
the
court
where
the
indictment
is
pending.”
let
me
once
more
review
the
phrases
used
by
blaier
and
by
this
petitioner.
blaier
says
because
it
might
aid
the
prosecution
in
the
case
under
which
i
am
--
in
which
i'm
under
indictment
and
this
petitioner
--
it
relates
or
might
be
claimed
to
relate
to
or
aid
the
prosecution
in
the
case
in
which
i
am
under
indictment
unless
be
in
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
now,
where
is
the
difference
between
those
two?
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
but
they
didn't
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
but
it
suggested
--
it
was
suggested
by
the
prosecution
in
its
brief
at
some
length
that
if
hutcheson
had
invoked
self-incrimination,
they
would
have
let
them
go
as
the
others
had
gone,
had
been
permitted
to
go.
i
say,
it
underscores
the
speculative
nature
and
i
think
it
underscores
the
speculative
nature
of
the
argument
and
what
i
don't
want
to
go
outside
the
record,
i
cannot
shut
my
mind
to
the
fact
that
hutcheson
was
the
general
president,
and
blaier
was
only
the
second
general
vice-president.
now,
it's
suggested
by
the
prosecution
that
the
way
for
hutcheson
to
protect
himself
was
to
invoke
the
specific
guarantee
of
the
self-incrimination
clause
and
not
rely
on
the
due
process
clause,
to
which
i
think
the
answer
is
that
if
he
relied
on
self
--
if
he
invoked
self-incrimination,
he
would
be
disadvantaging
himself
in
three
respects
and
he
would
not
be
adequately
protected
and
only
the
due
process
clause,
it
seems
to
me,
would
protect
him.
and
then
it
suggested
and
here
i
do
not
understand
the
legal
reasoning
that
this
after
all,
if
your
honors
please,
don't
take
this
too
seriously,
this
was
a
mild
sentence,
it's
true
there
were
18
counts
that
they
build
up
against
them,
but
they
only
got
six
months.
i
suppose
if
they've
got
the
maximum,
he
could
have
had
one
year
on
18
counts
consecutively
which
would
be
18
years
and
an
$18,000
fine
and
would
the
questions
before
your
honors
be
any
different?
of
course
they
were
the
same
questions
because
the
appellate
court
cannot
revise
sentences.
but
the
--
to
me
the
most
significant
portion
of
mr.
cox's
argument
was
his
introduction
when
at
some
length
he
denigrated
my
client
by
going
into
the
details
of
the
alleged
conspiracy
to
subvert
justice
or
to
use
a
shorter
word,
the
“fix.”
well,
that
showed
pretty
clearly
that
they
didn't
need
this
petitioner's
answers.
they
didn't
need
these
answers.
they
had
the
answers
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
terribly
significant
that
in
reading
from
the
chairman's
testimony
at
the
trial,
mr.
cox
in
his
argument
omitted
what
mr.
cox
in
his
written
argument
omitted
this
sentence,
“our
legislative
purpose
is
to
search
out
and
find
if
crime
has
been
committed.”
now,
i
don't
go
into
that
as
a
notion
of
motive.
i
distrust
the
attribution
of
motives
because
too
often,
when
one
person
attributes
motives
to
another,
he's
attributing
his
own
baser
emotions
to
someone
else.
i
refer
to
that
not
as
a
statement
of
motive
but
as
a
particularly
authoritative
statement
of
purpose.
our
legislative
purpose
is
to
search
out
and
find
if
crime
has
been
committed
and
up
above
it
said,
“our
legislative
function
had
been
performed
in
seeking
information
regarding
the
crimes
and
improper
activities.”
and
then
when
the
chairman
had
concluded,
the
committee
came
in
with
the
detailed
pinpointed
report
on
page
592.
this
was
incorporated
by
a
reference
at
the
request
of
the
prosecution
and
they
pinpointed
this
alleged
conspiracy
to
obstruct
justice
and
i
submit
that
any
competent
legislative
draftsman
would
have
had
enough
from
those
legislative
findings
to
draft
a
proper
act
to
stop
that
in
the
future.
they
didn't
need
--
they
didn't
need
these
petitioners'
answers.
well,
mr.
cox
said
that
this
is
a
very
delicate
matter
for
a
court
to
tell
a
committee
when
it
has
sufficient
evidence.
i
recall
the
court,
the
case
of
united
states
versus
smith
in
the
286
united
states
where
the
court
in
the
very
careful
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brandies
had
to
interpret
the
senate
rules
in
order
to
determine
whether
george
otis
smith
had
been
properly
confirmed
as
a
member
of
the
federal
power
commission.
and
to
the
argument
that
this
court
cannot
interpret
the
rules
of
the
senate,
the
answer
was,
we
have
to
interpret
the
rules
of
the
senate
when
other
people's
rights
depend
on
it.
now,
what
is
involved
here
is
the
consequences
of
judicial
action
and
judicial
power
which
up
to
now
has
been
exerted
with
the
view
to
sending
this
petitioner
to
jail
for
contempt
of
congress.
i
submit
it
is
not
only
proper,
it
is
necessary
for
this
court,
in
that
situation
to
ascertain
whether
these
questions
were
asked
for
any
proper
legislative
purpose
or
whether
they
were
asked
simply
to
embarrass
this
petitioner.
the
committee
had
enough
facts
to
make
the
accusation.
they
had
enough
facts
for
the
committee
chairman
at
the
close
of
the
petitioner's
testimony
to
come
in
with
a
verdict
of
guilty.
they
had
enough
facts
when
the
staff
got
together
the
committee
report
to
come
in
with
very
detailed
findings
as
to
what
went
on
in
lake
county
and
why
did
they
want
the
petitioner
there?
they
wanted
him
either
to
admit
or
to
plead
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
circumstances
that
would
have
disadvantaged
him
in
three
respects.
now,
i
submit,
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
--
as
i
see
it,
the
vital
focus
of
this
case,
is
it
asking
questions
for
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose
when
you're
asking
one
man
18
questions,
not
for
information,
but
in
the
colloquial
sense,
to
put
him
on
the
spot,
to
embarrass
him,
to
make
him
subject
to
penalties,
to
make
him
claim
a
privilege
which
will
not
wholly
protect
him,
which
will
carry
a
stigma
and
which
will
disadvantage
him.
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
those
questions
are
not
questions
asked
for
legitimate
legislative
fact
finding
purposes.
