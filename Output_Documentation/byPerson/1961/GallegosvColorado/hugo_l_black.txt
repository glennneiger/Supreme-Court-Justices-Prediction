justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
part
you've
just
been
reading.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
ground
of
your
objection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
on
page
171,
you
examined
dr.
rymer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
identified
substantially
to
the
same
thing,
did
he
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
response
to
your
inquiries.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
true,
did
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
his
name?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
dr.
rymer,
was
he
a
physician?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
testified
on
behalf
of
the
defendant,
did
he
not?
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
170,
it
says
charles
a.
rymer
called
the
witness
in
behalf
of
the
defendant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
examination
by
the
court
and
direct
examination
by
mr.
vigil.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
suppose
objection
(inaudible)
--
on
your
part
to
his
testifying
and
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
directly
you
examined
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see,
you're
making
--
the
top
of
page
168?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
goes
on.
i'm
not
perfectly
clear.
assuming
if
you
are
right
and
that
you
did
appear
and
they
let
him
testify,
what
is
the
due
process
--
what
effect
does
that
have
and
connects
with
your
due
process
contention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
forbidden
by
due
process
to
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
testify
any
confession
or
anything
like
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
to
his
mentality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
your
point
is
that
it
violated
due
process,
put
a
doctor
on
to
testify
his
mentality
over
your
objection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
grade
did
he
go
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
hadn't
been
convicted
of
any
offense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
defendant
testify
about
the
signing
of
the
confession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
now,
that's
raised
as
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
find
it
for
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
he
did
testify,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
was
before
the
court,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
read
this
--
what
i
thought
was
the
difference.
i
didn't
find
that
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
its
there,
if
you
say
it's
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
just
read
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
why
did
you
say
that
makes
the
statement
of
what
you're
just
referring?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
--
what
i
read
was
that
he
said
that
he
would
be
kept
in
juvenile
whether
he
confess
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statement
to
which
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
is
the
only
one
i
was
able
to
find
throughout
this
evidence
in
which
he
gave
a
reason
why
he
signed
the
paper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
all
this
evidence
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
whole
evidence,
that's
what
you
get
continuously
between
--
up
to
page
163,
are
they
not?is
it
all
continuous?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
if
they
told
him
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
testified
he
was
released
from
security
after
signing
this
paper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
said
nobody
proved
it,
he
would
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
eddie
martinez.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
was
the
12
--
the
14
and
the
12?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
in
the
room.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
the
rooms
besides
the
security
room.
justice
hugo
l.
black
against
whom
was
the
information
filed
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
bobby
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
the
defendant
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
bobby?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
practice?
as
i
understand
if
you
had
two
hearings,
well
you
had
one
hearing
as
to
whether
this
evidence
was
--
confessions
could
be
admitted,
call
the
judge
without
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
that
theory,
the
defendant
testified.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
officers
testified.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
is
his
duty
to
pass
merely
preliminarily
upon
the
admissibility
of
this
confession
with
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
law
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
it's
voluntary
or
not
voluntary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
that
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
of
the
officers
and
your
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
anyone
else,
offered
this
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
other
witness.
