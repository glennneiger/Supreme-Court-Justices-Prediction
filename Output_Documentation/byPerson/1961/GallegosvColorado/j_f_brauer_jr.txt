mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
honorable
court.
between
8:30
and
9
p.m.
on
december
20th,
1958,
the
defendant
who
was
then
14
years
old
and
two
other
boys
were
shining
shoes
in
downtown
denver.
they
weren't
making
very
much
money
and
they
thought
of
a
plan,
to
rob
an
old
man.
the
victim
that
they
picked
out
on
the
street
was
partially
drunk
and
they
followed
him
to
his
hotel.
but
since
they
lost
track
of
the
old
man,
they
left
one
boy
at
the
door,
the
youngest
one,
as
a
lookout,
and
the
other
two
went
on
upstairs
and
they
have
asked
some
people
up
there
if
their
grandfather
had
just
come
in.
and
the
people
upstairs
said,
“well,
the
old
man
next
door
just
came
in.”
so
they
knocked
at
the
indicated
door.
and
when
the
man
answered,
one
of
the
boys
asked
for
a
drink
of
water.
the
old
man
then
turned
around
to
get
the
water
and
the
defendant
struck
him
with
a
shoe
brush
and
he
fell
right
to
the
floor.
the
two
boys
together
then
held
a
knife
on
his
throat
and
took
his
wallet.
they
ran
downstairs,
picked
up
the
lookout
at
the
door
and
the
three
of
them
together
ran
on
to
a
viaduct
where
they
split
up
the
$13
they
found
in
the
wallet,
threw
the
wallet
and
the
shoe
brush
off
the
side
of
the
viaduct,
it
was
never
--
neither
were
ever
recovered.
twelve
days
later,
new
year's
night
on
the
1st
of
january,
1959,
the
defendant
was
questioned
by
an
officer
who
had
a
record
of
this
assault
and
a
description
of
the
suspects.
he
immediately
admitted
he's
involvement
in
this
entire
incident.
the
next
day,
he
was
booked
in
at
juvenile
hall,
rather
that
night,
he
was
booked
in
but
the
next
day,
he
again
admitted
he's
part
of
it.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
the
officer
had
a
description
of
the
suspects
and
apparently
he
was
just
driving
around
picking
up
people
who
might
possibly
fit
the
description
and
talking
to
them
about
it.
and
this
defendant,
right
there
in
the
police
offers
through
his
car
at
the
time
he
was
picked
up,
admitted
he's
part
of
it.
we
will
later
cite
and
quote
the
exact
parts
of
the
record.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
no,
he
was
picked
up
with
his
two
brothers.
the
one
i'm
talking
about
is
defendant,
robert
gallegos
with
him
were
his
two
brothers,
richard
and
charles
gallegos.
richard
was
the
eight-year-old.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
he
was
the
lookout
at
the
door.
charles
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
now
as
i
state,
he
again
confessed
the
next
day
and
the
officer
in
the
juvenile
hall
took
the
entire
matter
down
in
longhand.
all
of
the
details
that
i've
already
related
about
are
in
that
oral
confession
he
gave
the
next
day
to
the
officer.
it
was
on
the
7th
of
january
when
he
signed
his
first
written
confession.
he
at
that
time
affirmed
all
of
the
details
i've
already
given
and
besides
that,
he
affirmed
the
date
as
december
20th,
1958.
now
after
the
attack,
the
victim
was
immediately
taken
to
the
hospital.
he
had
numerous
fractures
and
bruises
on
its
jaws
and
cut
on
his
neck.
four
days
later,
he
left
into
unconsciousness.
he
was
reexamined
and
they
found
quite
a
few
blood
clots
which
the
doctor's
testified
were
secondary
to
the
blows
that
he
received
about
the
base
from
the
shoe
brush.
on
the
discovering
of
these
blood
clots
and
so
forth,
they
applied
additional
medications.
they
also
performed
surgery,
but
the
victim
did
not
respond
at
all.
he
died
on
the
26th
of
january,
1959,
some
36
days
later
--
35
days
later
after
the
initial
attack.
and
the
death
certificate,
it
is
true
as
to
bronchial
pneumonia,
that's
the
cause
of
death.
at
the
trial,
both
the
doctor
and
the
pathologist
testified
that
the
cause
of
the
--
of
death
was
bronchial
pneumonia
and
that
the
blows
about
the
head
and
face
brought
on
the
bronchial
pneumonia.
apparently,
it
was
somewhat
similar
to
the
situation
of
this
fighter
that
just
died.
they
said
he
died
of
bronchial
pneumonia
caused
by
the
blows
about
the
face
and
the
head.
now
all
of
the
above
that
i
mentioned
in
regarding
this
case,
was
brought
out
during
the
people
side
of
the
presentation.
in
a
hearing
out
of
this
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
no.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
this
was
all
brought
out
in
open
court
before
the
jury.
in
a
hearing,
not
at
the
presence
of
the
jury,
the
defendant
denied
his
participation
in
the
event.
he
denied
making
the
oral
confessions.
he
said
the
written
statement
was
forced
out.
but
during
the
presentation
in
front
of
the
jury,
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand.
he
presented
other
witnesses
in
an
attempt
to
establish
an
alibi.
the
other
witnesses
testified
that
the
defendant
and
the
other
two
boys
allegedly
involved
in
this
affair
were
all
at
the
home
of
one
of
the
boys
watching
television
for
the
entire
evening
when
these
all
occurred.
now,
the
defendant
himself
also
presented
to
the
court,
the
juvenile
court
psychiatrist
--
psychologist,
pardon
me.
and
the
psychologist
said
that
in
his
opinion,
the
defendant
had
an
iq
of
70
regarding
his
language
ability,
the
ability
to
communicate.
but
he
said
he
had
an
overall
of
iq
of
83
which
was
equal
to
that
of
the
average
10
or
11-year-old.
the
psychologist
also
said
that
the
defendant
had
feelings
of
insecurity
and
of
being
retarded
and
was
more
prone
to
suggestions
from
others
than
with
the
normal
--
the
average
person
to
be.
i'd
like
to
point
out
at
this
point
that
in
colorado,
once
the
person
is
physically
14
years
old,
his
ability
--
his
mental
ability
short
of
insanity
is
immaterial,
i
can
feel
that
that
was
clear
for
mr.
vigil's
presentation
between
10
where
--
when
they
first
might
be
accountable
for
a
crime
and
14,
their
ability
to
distinguish
good
from
evil
is
all
important
and
whether
or
not
they're
tried.
but
once
they're
physically
14
years
old,
they
are
accountable
unless
they're
going
to
plea
and
show
insanity.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
no.
no
defense
of
insanity
was
ever
presented.
now,
the
psychiatrist
that
was
called
testified
about
eddie
martinez,
his
ability
to
distinguish
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
because
he
was
only
12.
and
being
in
that
group
between
10
and
14,
this
was
conclusive
factor
as
to
whether
or
not
he
knew
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
and
could
understand
the
nature
of
a
no.
the
psychiatrist
said
he
could
not
and
therefore
the
case
was
dropped
as
eddie
martinez.
but
after
robert
gallegos,
the
supreme
court
has
ruled
previously
that
once
--
then
you
show
they
are
14
years
old
physically,
then
they're
in
the
same
category
as
an
adult.
and
unless
they
show
insanity,
they
are
responsible
for
their
crimes.
no
insanity
was
ever
pleaded.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
well
as
far
as
he's
appearing
before
the
court,
it's
our
contention
your
honor
that
he
did
not.
he
examined
gallegos
because
mr.
vigil
submitted
a
petition
to
the
court
to
have
the
boys
examined
by
a
psychiatrist
to
aid
him
in
preparing
their
defense.
this
was
a
special
petition.
it
was
not
done
the
way
it
would
have
been
done
if
they
were
going
to
plead
insanity.
if
they're
going
to
plead
insanity,
they
must
state
their
plea
and
then
the
court
appoints
the
psychiatrist
who
report
back
to
the
court.
but
mr.
vigil
just
came
into
the
court
with
the
petition
and
said
he
thought
it
would
aid
him
in
this
case
to
have
a
psychiatric
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
don't
believe
the
law
says
it's
compulsory
--
there's
a
compulsory
psychiatric
examination.
it
says
he
is
accountable
if
it
is
shown
that
he
can
distinguish
between
good
and
evil.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
it
would
be
as
to
eddie
martinez.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
the
one
who
was
12.
he
is
not
before
this
court.
he
was
never
even
tried
let
alone
convicted
in
presenting
an
appeal.
the
cases
against
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
excuse
me.
pardon
me?
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
no,
the
case
was
dropped
(inaudible)
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
if
he
had
been
shown
to
understand
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong,
he
could
have,
yes.
but
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
--
then
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
in
more
serious
crimes,
they
can
be
tried
either
in
the
district
court
under
the
criminal
statutes
or
they
can
be
handled
as
juvenile
delinquent
in
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
can't
remember
the
exact
distinction.
i
believe
after
they're
16,
the
discretion
within
the
authorities
to
use
one
court
or
the
other
is
broader
than
when
they're
under
16.
but
i
feel
that
all
of
this
is
aside
from
the
main
point
because
we
haven't
heard
of
it
today,
not
martinez
who
was
12.
we
have
gallegos
who
was
14
and
who
--
a
lot
says
he's
accountable.
14
or
over,
you're
accountable
unless
you
plead
and
show
insanity
which
he
never
even
attempted
to
do.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
he
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
they
said
that
they
are
--
when
they
talked
about
ability
to
communicate
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
--
they
mean
language
ability.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
assumed
it
is
measured
by
vocabulary
and
ability
to
express
ones
self.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
as
to
that,
he
had
an
iq
of
70
which
they
said
was
equal
to
an
average
eight
or
nine-year-old.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
it
is
not
in
the
record
as
to
why
this
might
have
occurred.
in
denver,
it
is
often
true
that
spanish-americans
because
of
less
exposure
to
english
than
the
general
population,
either
so
many
of
their
friends
and
families
speak
spanish
in
their
home
are
poor
on
communication
even
all
the
way
through
schools.
they
just
don't
have
a
vocabulary
that
people
have
that
were
brought
up
in
english
speaking
homes.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
believe
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record.
i
believe
it
were
--
i
believe
there
was
mentioned
somewhere
but
i
don't
think
it's
clear
as
to
--
i
--
he
was
in
grade
school.
that
was
i
believe.
now,
before
the
victim
ever
died,
the
defendant
was
brought
into
juvenile
court
and
charged
as
a
juvenile
delinquent.
he
was
found
to
be
a
juvenile
delinquent
and
he
was
committed
to
the
state
industrial
school
before.
i
might
state
this
is
no
criminal
proceeding.
this
double
jeopardy
is
completely
out
of
the
question
it
seems
because
there
wasn't
even
any
conviction,
let
alone
a
conviction
of
murder.
the
guy
hadn't
even
died
yet.
so
it's
just
a
cri
--
a
juvenile
proceeding
in
which
he
is
adjudged
to
delinquent
and
committed
to
the
state
industrial
school.
that
happened
within
a
couple
of
weeks
after
the
boy's
first
confession.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
it's
--
if
there's
no
term
stated.
he
cannot
be
there
after
he
is
18
years
old
by
colorado
statute.
he
can't
be
in
that
industrial
school.
then
after
the
victim
died,
he
was
charged
in
criminal
court
for
first
degree
murder,
pled
of
course
not
guilty
and
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
now,
that
sentence
has
been
stated
any
of
these
many
appeals
and
in
the
meantime
of
course,
their
commitment
to
the
industrial
school
has
been
enforced
about
two
weeks
ago,
he
turned
18
and
therefore,
he
has,
in
the
last
two
weeks,
been
in
the
county
jail
because
he's
not
eligible
under
law
to
be
staying
longer
in
the
state
industrial
school.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
the
jury
sentences
a
defendant
if
he
is
over
18.
this
is
another
point
out
that
comes
to
later
because
the
death
penalty
is
not
possible
for
one
who
is
under
18
and
the
conviction
of
first
degree
murder
then
has
only
one
possible
sentence
in
colorado,
life
imprisonment.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
or
released
them
if
they
have
been
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i,
your
honor,
i'm
not
fully
familiar
with
all
the
transfer
proceedings.
i
have
not
dealt
with
that
particular
fate.
i
didn't
feel
it
was
important
to
this
case.
as
i
say,
they
could
not
transfer
him
to
the
state
penitentiary.
there
are
such
institutions
as
the
reformatory
and
so
forth,
and
i'm
not
thoroughly
familiar
with
what
circumstances
would
allow
a
transfer
to
which
one
of
those.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
he
would
have
to
get
out
of
the
state
industrial
school.
he
don't
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
he
hadn't
been
convicted
of
any
offense
but
there
are
other
institutions
for
juvenile
delinquents
beside
the
state
industrial
school.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
no.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
and
that
was
the
matter
fact
they're
usually
out
long
before
they're
18.
these
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
--
juvenile
court
commitments
are
very
rarely
for
anytime
up
past
the
time
when
they
would
be
eligible
to
be
in
the
institution
to
which
they're
committed,
they
are
released
prior
to
that
on
their
indefinite
sentence.
now
first
of
all
as
to
the
defendant's
confession,
a
written
confession
which
he
signed
after
the
period
in
security,
it
is
of
course
our
position
that
this
was
properly
admitted
to
the
trial
court
for
its
consideration.
and
i
just
want
to
reiterate
the
facts
because
it's
our
position
that
if
a
court
thoroughly
remembers
the
fact
in
sequence
as
to
how
they
happen,
that
then
the
position
of
the
state
of
colorado
becomes
quite
clear
on
the
entire
manner.
it
was
on
the
1st
of
january
of
1959,
in
the
evening
when
the
defendant
was
picked
up
and
right
there
in
the
officer's
car
admitted
that
he
was
involved
in
this.
this
is
shown
on
page
116
of
the
record.
he
read
about
a
third
to
the
way
down.
i
was
checking
the
area,
looking
for
the
boys
who
fit
the
descriptions
on
the
report
and
i
located
robert
and
his
brother,
charles,
and
his
brother
richard
at
19th
and
curtis
outside
of
the
dutchman's
inn,
i
believe
it
is
called.
question,
what
happened
at
that
time?
answer,
i
asked
him
to
sit
in
the
car
and
asked
him
regarding
this
offense.
richard
immediately
admitted
the
offense
and
robert
told
me,
he
was
involved
too.
now
at
that
point,
he
was
taken
to
juvenile
hall
when
he
was
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
no,
that
occurred
the
next
day.
i'm
coming
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
he
was
still
alive
at
this
point,
that's
right.
the
boys
were
then
taken
to
juvenile
hall.
the
next
day,
both
of
the
two
who
were
involved
again
confessed
the
entire
affair.
they
admitted
another
similar
offense
also.
this
is
shown
on
pages
1,
starting
at
page
117
and
over
to
118.
i'll
read
the
relevant
portions.
they
said
richard
and
robert
followed
mr.
smith
upstairs.
and
losing
him,
they
inquired
to
different
parties
that
--
that
they
were
looking
for
their
grandfather.
one
party
told
them,
“the
man
just
next
door
had
come
in
and
it
was
probably
him.”
again,
they
said,
“eddie
stayed
downstairs.
robert
said
he
knocked
on
the
door.
someone
told
him
to
come
in.
and
when
they
opened
the
door,
he
saw
it
was
the
man
they
were
looking
for.
then
he
punched
the
man
on
the
chin
with
his
fist.”
the
court,
who
did
this?
the
witness,
robert.
and
he
then
proceeded
to
get
his
bill
fold
out
of
his
rear
pocket.
now,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
the
last
paragraph
on
page
2
of
the
reply
brief,
which
has
come
in,
in
the
part
about
two-thirds
all
the
way
down
on
page
4.
so
the
question
here
is
to
which
boys
were
originally
picked
up
and
whether
their
statements
that
they
gave
prior
to
their
being
put
in
security
in
juvenile
hall
were
individual
statements
from
each
one
or
whether
they
were
some
kind
of
a
combined
statement
that
the
police
gathered
from
all
three.
now,
it's
clear
that
the
three
gallegos
brothers
were
picked
up
first.
and
then
charles,
when
they
found
out
he
was
not
at
all
--
all
involved
was
released.
eddie
martinez
was
later
then
picked
up
but
there
was
no
combined
statement,
the
statement
obtained
and
that
the
police
officers
testified
about
him
on
the
stand
were
individual
statements.
this
had
to
show
somewhat
on
page
125,
near
the
bottom.
and
it
shows
that
the
only
person
who
talked
about
combined
statements
was
the
defendant's
counsel
where
he
asked
the
officer,
“you
combined
the
statements
though.
you
had
been
questioning
them
and
you
combined
the
statements.”
answer,
no.
after
richard
told
me
what
happened
when
he
admitted
they
were
the
boys
then
robert
verified
that.
question,
and
richard
is
the
eight-year-old?
answer,
yes,
sir.
“and
then
robert,
his
brother
said
that
was
so?
answer,
yes.
who
was
the
third
boy
in
the
car?
answer,
their
brother
charles.
what
did
charles
have
to
do
with
this?
answer,
when
we
took
him
to
juvenile
court,
robert
told
me
he
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it
but
eddie
martinez
who
lived
at
45th
in
mariposa
was
the
one
that
was
with
him.
i
think
this
shows
how
the
three
got
picked
up
that
they
did
get
individual
admissions
from
each
of
the
two
involved
gallegos'
brothers,
but
then
they
later
picked
up
the
other
fellow,
eddie
martinez
who
the
gallegos
boys
said
was
also
in
on
it.
now,
it
was
at
8:30
p.m.
on
the
night
after
he
was
picked
up
just
about
24
hours
later,
2nd
of
january,
that
all
three
gave
complete
confessions.
the
defendant
himself
gave
the
facts
which
the
officer
recorded
in
longhand
and
which
are
shown
on
pages
197
to
199
of
the
record.
mr.
vigil
starts
reading
at
the
top
of
197.
i'd
like
to
go
on
a
little
further
and
show
what
the
officer
said
on
pages
197
through
199,
the
relevant
parts
that
the
defendant
had
testified
--
had
admitted
to
him.
he
admitted
another
assault
that
he
took
part
in
another
assault
on
an
old
man
in
a
hotel
at
1851
champa
street.
he
did
say
he
didn't
strike
the
old
man
that
he
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
that.
but
upon
leaving
the
premises,
he
proceeded
down
to
18th
in
curtis
street
where
he
was
shining
shoes
that
upon
seeing
an
old
man
who
was
later
identified
as
robert
f.
smith,
he
followed
him
to
a
hotel
on
18th
street.
he
didn't
know
the
name
of
the
hotel
or
address.
question,
did
he
say
he
was
with
them
in
one?
answer,
yes
sir.
he
told
me
he
was
with
his
younger
brother
richard
and
one
eddie
martinez.
question,
alright.
answer,
they
followed
the
old
man
to
the
hotel
and
richard
stayed
downstairs
and
watch
out
for
cops.
he
and
eddie
went
upstairs
and
they
lost
track
of
the
old
man.
they
asked
several
if
they
had
seen
his
grandfather
come
in,
that
he
had
just
come
in
and
was
drunk.”
i'd
like
to
skip
down
at
the
bottom
of
198
and
the
story
continues
there.
he
said
upon
knocking
on
the
other
door,
someone
told
him
to
come
in,
that
he
opened
the
door
and
he
had
seen
it
was
the
man
he
was
looking
for.
he
said
at
that
time,
eddie
martinez
asked
the
old
man
for
a
drink
of
water
and
when
the
old
man
brought
the
water,
eddie
grabbed
him
and
he,
robert,
hit
the
old
man
about
the
head
and
face
with
the
shoe
brush.
that
when
the
old
man
fell
to
the
floor,
he
took
a
knife
and
held
it
at
the
old
man's
throat
and
took
his
bill
fold
out
of
his
back
pocket.
question,
did
he
say
what
they
then
did?
answer,
he
said,
they
all
left
in
and
went
to
the
23rd
street
viaduct
where
he
gave
eddie
$3
and
they
kept
$10
to
split
between
him
and
richard
and
they
then
went
home.
that
he
threw
the
billfold
and
the
brush
over
the
23rd
street
viaduct
which
was
never
located.
now,
i
make
it
so
hard
to
read
this
record
and
say
that
this
boy
did
not
give
an
oral
confession.
i
don't
know
what
else
more
this
boy
could've
told
that
officer.
he
obviously
confessed
everything
there
was
to
confess.
before
he
was
even
placed
in
the
confinement,
which
the
counsel
now
alleges
was
the
--
the
cause
of
a
later
coerced
confession.
notice
that
he
had
already
thoroughly
admitted
the
entire
thing
before
they
even
alleged
that
the
coercion
had
begun.
now,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
--
defendant
was
told
that
he
could
see
an
attorney.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
if
you
look
on
197
about
one-third
of
the
way
down,
this
starts
with,
“you
had
another
discussion
with
him
at
juvenile
hall,
when
was
that?
answer,
january
2nd.
then
all
that
i
read
you
was
what
robert
gallegos
revealed
on
january
2nd
to
the
police.
now
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
defendant
was
told
that
he
could
see
an
attorney,
told
that
he
could
see
his
mother.
as
to
whether
or
not,
he
was
told
that
his
statement
had
to
be
voluntary.
of
course,
the
only
important
factor
on
this
is
whether
or
not
robert
was
told
all
of
that.
the
brief
talked
about
what
the
boy
were
told.
well,
we
only
have
to
worry
about
robert
has
told.
and
all
of
the
quotations
on
the
defendant's
own
reply
brief
on
page
3,
show
that
this
defendant
was
told
that
he
could
see
his
mother
and
that
he
could
see
an
attorney.
the
only
dispute
is
whether
he
actually
said,
“i
don't
want
to
see
either”
or
whether
he
shook
his
head
or
whether
he
said,
“no,
i
don't
want
to
see
either.”
there's
no
dispute
from
the
defendant's
own
quotation
that
he
was
advised
that
he
could
see
the
lawyer
and
could
see
his
mother.
it's
our
position
of
course
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
she
came
the
first
time,
was
told
what
visiting
hours
was.
the
next
time
she
came
back
was
on
visiting
hours
then
she
was
permitted
to
see
them
--
to
see
him.
he
never
asked
for
her
at
any
time.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
the
first
time
was
on
a
friday
night,
i
believe.
they
were
picked
up
on
a
thursday
night
then
she
came
friday
night.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
believe
so.
i
have
that
further
on
down
in
some
of
my
information
and
then
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
she
could
have
come
the
following
monday
but
she
didn't,
she
came
thursday.
those
were
the
visiting
nights,
were
seven
to
eight.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
he
was
kept
in
security.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
the
difference
mainly
is
that
he
was
told
he
could
have
either
a
lawyer,
or
his
mother,
or
both
if
he
wanted
them
and
he
never
requested
either
of
them.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
she
wanted
to
see
him
that
one
time
but
she
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
they
didn't
this
time.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
normally,
they
do
let
them
in
if
they
come
at
visiting
hours.
she
did
not
come
at
visiting
hours
and
the
next
time
that
was
visiting
hours,
she
didn't
come
either.
now,
it's
true
this
may
not
have
been
the
best
procedure.
but
as
i
was
starting
to
say,
it's
our
position
and
on
all
of
this,
you
don't
have
to
show
any
of
this
to
show
that
the
statement
was
voluntary
and
properly
admissible.
you
don't
have
to
show
he
was
advised
to
have
--
he
could
have
an
attorney.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
in
order
to
judge
the
fairness
of
the
whole
totality
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
which
he
was
held,
of
course
i'd
also
like
to
show
it
before
he
was
ever
placed
in
that
security
where
she
couldn't
see
him.
he'd
already
admitted
the
whole
thing.
as
soon
as
he
was
picked
up,
he
started
admitting
it
and
the
next
day
elaborated
the
crime.
so
that
the
main
question
presented
here
is,
was
the
written
confession
which
they
later
obtained
voluntary?
and
you
do
consider
all
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
boy
was
picked
up
and
held.
but
one
of
the
things
you
can't
escape
is,
if
you're
going
to
decide
that
this
last
one
was
involuntary,
have
you
considered
that
before
any
alleged
coercion
started,
before
his
mother
even
--
it
was
turned
away
at
the
door.
he'd
already
confessed
the
whole
thing.
now
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
we
were
thinking
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight.
i
did
not
try
this
case
of
course.
i'd
represented
it
on
appeal.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
they
would
not
attach
it.
they
did.
the
district
attorney
in
the
lower
court
obviously
wanted
to
and
did.
but
i
think
that
they
have
their
conviction
established
by
his
oral
admissions.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
we
don't
think
it's
the
best
procedure.
we
do
say
that
there
are
numerous
cases
from
this
court
which
come
right
out
and
say
that
if
the
first
one
is
involuntary,
that
then
we're
going
to
presume
that
the
later
ones
are
also
involuntary
unless
they
were
definitely
intervening
circumstances,
the
federal
digest
section
has
numerous
cases
from
all
of
the
federal
courts
with
this
holding.
we're
hol
--
we're
calling
for
the
reverse
of
this
proposition.
there's
only
one
case
we've
found
that
has
discussed
the
reverse.
it's
an
illinois
case
cited
on
page
8
of
our
brief.
if
the
first
ones
were
voluntary,
can
you
realistically
say
that
there's
anything
unreliable
about
the
second
one?
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
--
there's
no
evidence
that
in
the
early
part
they
asked
him
to
sign
and
he
refused.
it's
hard
to
say
they
held
him
until
he
signed
a
written
confession
when
he
orally
confessed
immediately
and
he
signed
the
written
confession
the
first
time
he
was
asked.
if
not
as
if
he
had
first
refused
to
sign,
then
they
held
him
until
he
did.
i
think
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
well
at
the
trial,
he
denied
having
ever
orally
admitted
it.
he
said
that
the
written
one
was
forced
out
from
him.
they
said
that
they
hold
him
in
security
longer
if
he
didn't
sign
it.
but
if
he
did
sign,
he
could
go
home.
that's
what
he
said.
of
course
the
jury
had
all
this
in
front
them.
they
were
the
ones
it
seems
to
me
to
decide
whether
the
police
officers
were
telling
the
truth
or
whether
the
defendant
was
telling
the
truth.
now,
in
order
though
to
show
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
then
all
of
this
same
evidence
from
the
same
witnesses
came
before
the
jury
after
i've
been
previously
come
before
the
court.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
exactly
what
happened.
as
i
say
in
order
to
judge
the
fairness
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
i've
found
indication
of
the
reliability
and
therefore
the
admissibility
because
if
they're
inadmissible
because
of
coercion,
it's
because
they're
unreliable.
that's
the
basis
of
the
whole
thing.
well,
how
fairly
was
he
treated?
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
it
seems
when
you
read
the
cases
on
it
that
the
reason
coerced
confessions
are
outlawed
is
because
there's
always
a
chance
that
someone
would
be
forced
him
to
sign
in
a
confession,
confessing
a
crime
he'd
never
committed.
they're
unreliable.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
not
one
that's
been
always
forced,
but
when
you
have
disputed
evidence
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
pardon
me,
one
that's
forced.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
you
can't
get
a
forced
confession
in
by
corroborating.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
but
in
determining
whether
it
was
forced
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
not
if
it's
shown
to
be
coerced.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
we're
saying
here
the
corroboration
shows
it
wasn't
coerced.
we're
saying
any
kid
who
confesses
as
soon
as
picked
up,
definitely
later
confessed
because
it's
coerced
but
because
he
wants
to
confess.
we're
saying
that
corroboration
doesn't
justify
the
coerced
confession.
we're
saying
the
corroboration
shows
he
couldn't
have
been
coerced.
this
kid
confessed.
it's
really
involuntary
but
soon
as
the
police
officers
even
talked
to
him
about
it.
now,
to
show
how
fairly
he
was
con
--
considerate
at
how
the
officers
explained
different
things
to
him
while
he
was
in
custody.
on
page
139
of
the
record,
we
read
from
one
of
the
police
officer's
testimony.
i
told
him
i
was
instructed
to
take
a
statement
and
if
they
wanted
to
give
him
statements,
that
i
was
there.
they
wanted
to
make
them,
to
obtain
them
from
the
boys.
i
explained
if
they
wanted
their
parents
to
come
in.
with
them,
it
would
be
fine
and
if
they
wanted
an
attorney,
it
would
be
fine
and
if
they
didn't
want
to
make
a
statement,
he
so
he
didn't
have
too.
and
i'd
say
if
you
want
to
get
this
whole
thing
straightened
out,
i
want
you
to
tell
me
the
truth
about
the
matter
and
they
said
they
would.
question,
you
had
previously
given
them
the
opportunity
to
get
counsel
or
have
their
parents
there?
answer,
i
told
them
if
they
wanted
an
attorney,
or
to
have
their
parents,
it
would
be
fine.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
well
you
see
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
you
see
he
has
confessed
another
crime
besides
it.
they
were
still
investigating
the
second
one.
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
they
kept
on
holding
and
one
of
the
reasons
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
--
they
didn't
get
the
written
confession.
here,
gallegos
also
admitted
knowing
all
about
if
not
being
directly
involved,
the
assault
on
the
other
old
man,
who
was
robert.
so
that
as
far
as
getting
it
straightened
out,
he
was
talking,
i
think,
to
any
offenses
you
haven't
even
told
me
about
in
addition
to
the
ones
you
have
told
me.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that
he
told
them
about
the
other
offense?
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
yes.
that's
in
ethical.
gallegos
admitted
also
knowing
about
it.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
directly
there.
it
just
shows
that
gallegos
had
mentioned
the
other
crime
also
and
that
then
the
officer
talked
to
him
this
way.
it
didn't
show
that
because
he
had
mentioned
the
other
crime,
i
talked
to
him
like
this.
so
you
have
to
read
that
into
it
if
it's
there?
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i'm
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
--
reading
on
page
139
now
and
i
just
would
like
to
finish
that.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
did
they
ever
request
an
attorney
or
to
have
their
parents
present?
answer,
they
did
not.
did
they
make
the
statement
then
voluntarily?
answer,
they
did.
now
this
certainly
is
very
interesting
in
view
of
the
claim
that
they
weren't
given
adequate
considerations
regarding
their
right
to
have
parents
or
attorneys
or
to
make
statements
voluntarily
or
not
at
all.
on
pages
146
and
147,
we
find
some
more
testimony
that
substantiates
the
state
of
colorado
position
that
this
boy
was
given
every
consideration
he
could
ever
have
expected.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
on
the
bottom
of
page
146
where
mr.
vigil
as
cross-examining
the
testifying
officer,
the
officer
said,
“as
i
previously
stated
mr.
vigil,
i
told
them
i
was
instructed
to
come
down
and
get
a
statement
from
them
if
they
cared
to
make
one.
i
told
them
if
they
wanted
their
parents
to
accompany
them
that
they
could.
i
told
them
if
they
wanted
an
attorney
to
accompany
them,
they
could
have
that.
and
i
told
them
if
they
didn't
want
to
go
with
me,
they
didn't
have
to.”
the
court,
you
told
them
they
could
have
a
lawyer
and
their
parents
go
with
him.
answer,
yes,
sir.
additionally
on
page
211
of
the
record,
this
is
also
a
cross-examination
by
defendant's
counsel
of
the
testifying
officers.
you
stated
--
you
told
robert
gallegos
several
things
upon
your
first
meeting
with
him
including
the
facts
that
he
could
have
a
lawyer
if
he
wanted
one,
that
he
could
have
his
parents
present
if
he
wanted,
that
he
didn't
have
to
say
anything
if
he
didn't
want
to.
did
you
make
and
use
this
as
a
part
of
a
general
statement
or
did
you
just
ask
him?
answer,
no
sir.
we
were
out
of
juvenile
hall
and
i
asked
the
three
boys.
they
were
brought
down.
at
that
time
i
told
them
it
was
my
job
to
attempt
to
obtain
a
statement.
and
at
that
time
i
outlined
what
i
have
previously
said.
now
as
to
informing
the
mother
of
the
seriousness
of
this
situation,
the
defendant's
reply
brief
cites
at
page
134
of
the
record
for
the
proposition
that
the
mother
was
never
really
told
how
serious
this
whole
thing
was.
we
feel
that
we
should
go
a
little
further
in
this
record
and
read
on
pages
135
and
136,
a
few
of
the
relevant
statements
that
i
have
found
there
in
this
record.
question,
when
you
took
charles
home,
did
you
advice
the
mother
of
charles
as
to
where
her
other
boys
were?
answer,
yes.
and
further
down,
“i
claimed
where
the
boys
were,
that
is
richard
and
robert
and
i
bought
charles
back
but
robert
told
me
charles
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it
and
eddie
martinez
was
with
him.”
question,
did
you
explain
the
details,
the
reasons
why
you
kept
the
boys
at
juvenile
hall?
as
to
the
assault
on
mr.
smith
and
also
on
mr.
cruise.
so
here,
he
already
knows
about
the
other
admission
at
the
time
he
first
--
that
first
night
when
he
picked
the
boys
up.
question,
did
she
make
any
answer
at
that
time?
answer,
she
made
the
remark
to
me
that
she
wanted
help
to
get
them
straightened
out.
then
on
page
136,
near
the
bottom,
“i
told
robert,
richard,
and
also
charles,
that
is
when
he
told
me
charles
was
not
involved,
i
explained
how
serious
it
was,
what
it
was
for
that
was
assault
and
robbery.
the
court,
and
did
you
say
possibly
murder
the
witness?
i
told
the
mother
that
as
i
recall
when
i
took
charles
back
home.
now,
how
can
you
say
that
the
mother
wasn't
advised
of
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
when
the
officer
comes
home
with
the
one
boy
and
said
this
boy
isn't
involved?
the
other
two
have
admitted
their
part
and
an
assault
that
could
lead
you
a
murder
charge.
and
then
they
say
that
she
was
not
advised
of
the
seriousness
of
the
situation.
we
don't
understand
that.
we
think
the
record
refused
it.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
she
went
down
the
next
night.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
and
at
that
time,
it's
true,
they
did
not
let
her
in.
but
she
was
advised
for
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
and
they
never
requested
her
to
come
according
to
the
police
officer.
now,
as
to
advising
her
when
she
could
see
the
defendant,
it
is
true
that
the
part
of
the
record
on
page
223
which
we
did
cite
in
our
brief
was
later
stricken.
that's
the
part
where
she
admits
that
the
officer
who
brought
one
boy
home
told
her
when
the
visiting
hours
were
and
when
she
could
come
in
to
see
the
boy.
now,
that
was
stricken.
but
the
part
of
the
record
which
is
on
page
134
where
the
officer
testified
that
he
told
her
what
the
visiting
hours
were
was
not
stricken.
so
it
is
still
in
the
record
that
when
the
boy
was
brought
home,
she
was
told
when
the
visiting
hours
were
that
she
could
see
the
other
two
boys
who
were
not
brought
home.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
page
134,
about
a
third
of
the
way
down.
the
officer
said,
“sure,
i
remember
telling
mrs.
gallegos
when
i
took
charles
back
what
the
visiting
hours
were.”
now
there's
another
place,
your
honor,
where
she
got
on
the
stand
and
said
that
she
was
told
that
they
were
monday
and
thursday
from
7
to
8
p.m.
but
that
was
stricken
so
that
it
isn't
before
the
court
as
a
matter
that
they
should
really
consider
on
appeal.
it's
clear
that
she
tried
to
see
him
on
the
2nd
of
january,
not
the
night
he
was
picked
up
which
was
a
thursday
and
she
could've
gone
down.
but
the
--
the
next
night
which
was
a
friday,
and
her
next
try
was
the
8th
of
january,
she
went
over
the
following
thursday.
and
at
that
time,
she
was
allowed
to
see
him,
she
came
during
visiting
hours.
it's
also
clear
that
the
boys
never
asked
for
their
mother
and
that
the
mother
told
the
police
that
she
wanted
help
in
getting
the
boys
straightened
out.
now,
pages
6
and
7
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
yes,
that
was
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
what
they
told
her.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
she
testified
that.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
and
then
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
because
he
was
under
investigation.
we
of
its
--
as
the
position
of
the
state
of
colorado,
i
want
your
honors
to
understand,
we
don't
endorse
every
action
that
was
taken
in
this
case
by
the
police
department,
by
the
juvenile
officers.
we
do
say
though
that
the
sum
total
of
it
does
not
add
up
to
a
coerced
confession.
it
did
not
add
up
to
an
unreliable
confession.
it
doesn't
add
up
to
a
--
a
conviction
that
has
been
obtained
in
violation
of
due
process.
the
testimony
is
all
true
there
that
if
the
boys
wanted
their
mother,
they
could
have
it
right
away
if
they
requested
the
mother
and
that
they
never
requested
her.
now,
it's
too
bad
if
she
was
told
that
she
would
wait
next
thursday.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
as
i'd
say
we
--
we're
not
proud
that
they
did
that
particular
part
but
we
also
say
that
you
can't
say
that
because
the
mother
didn't
get
there,
the
boy
was
so
abused
that
his
confession
was
forced
and
it's
unreliable
and
he
was
denied
his
right
even
though
he
orally
confessed
as
soon
as
he
was
picked
up
before
any
of
these
coercive
factors
supposedly
were
--
were
placed
about.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
six.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
almost
six
whole
days,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
he
was
picked
up
on
the
evening
of
the
first,
confessed
orally
then.
he
confessed
orally
on
the
second.
he
was
placed
in
security,
the
night
of
the
second.
on
the
7th,
he
signed
the
written
confession.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
what
happened.
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
whether
this
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
think
it's
quite
a
factor
that
this
court
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
--
court
should
remember.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
agree,
your
honor,
it
certainly
would've
been
better
if
they
had
allowed
the
mother
to
see
him
immediately.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
and
the
only
reason
that
this
is
important
is
whether
or
not
it
resulted
in
a
coerced
confession
and
we
say
it
didn't.
i
might
say
the
jury
said
it
did.
this
was
all
in
front
of
them.
they
had
proper
instructions.
now,
mr.
vigil
indicated
today
or
seemed
indicated,
perhaps
the
instructions
weren't
complete
in
all
case,
regarding
the
voluntariness
wasn't
in
front
of
the
jury.
well,
that
hasn't
been
raised
before.
we
don't
think
that's
even
in
front
of
this
court.
the
way
it
comes
to
this
court
is
that
no
objections
to
the
instructions
on
this
point
were
--
were
made
in
the
lower
court
and
the
jury
had
everything
in
front
of
them
that
they
could
have
asked
for
to
decide
and
they
decided
it
was
free
and
voluntary
after
the
court
had
made
the
--
the
preliminary
ruling
to
that
effect.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
he
said
that
they
told
him
that
if
he
didn't
sign
it,
he'd
be
kept
in
security
and
that
if
he
did
sign
it,
he
could
go
home.
that's
what
they
--
what
he
said
they
told
him.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
will
see
if
i
can
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i'll
see
if
i
can
find
it
your
honor.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
was
that
denied?
oh,
by
all
the
police
officers,
yes.
this
was
made
in
the
hearing
out
of
the
presence
of
a
juror
where
the
court
was
making
its
preliminary
determination
as
to
voluntariness
or
the
lack
of
it
as
a
confession.
this
didn't
come
before
the
jury
because
he
never
took
the
stand
in
front
of
a
jury.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
not
in
front
of
the
jury.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
before
the
court
in
a
(inaudible)
in
a
hearing
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
he
testified
that
he
was
told
that
if
he
didn't
sign
the
confession,
he
would
be
kept
in
security
and
then
if
he
did
sign
it,
he
could
go
home.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
near
the
end
of
that
period.
i'll
see
if
i
can
find
it
your
honor
at
the
record.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
(inaudible)
on
this
one,
yes.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
know
on
page
176
there's
quite
a
bit
of
it.
on
page
165,
there
are
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
--
some
of
it.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
this
is
where
he
later
reneged
on
the
earlier
statements.
this
is
where
they
asked
him
in
the
out
of
jury
hearing,
“did
anyone
say
anything
about
releasing
you
from
security?”
he
said,
“no
sir.”
but
it
--
it's
before
that
where
he
--
at
first
told
on
direct
examination,
the
opposite
story
which
was
that
he
was
told
that
if
he
signed
he
could
be
released,
if
he
didn't
sign
he
couldn't
pay.
now,
i
don't
have
my
finger
on
that
--
that
part
right
now.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
at
one
point
he
said
that,
that's
right.
the
boy
varied
in
his
explanation
in
this
hearing
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
it
was
typed
up
i
believe.
i
--
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
when
it
was
typed
your
honor.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
it
was
as
near
as
i
can
tell.
the
record
seems
to
indicate
that
the
reason
he
wasn't
typed
sooner,
the
reason
they
didn't
request
him
to
sign
it
sooner
is
because
they
weren't
sure
if
they
wanted
to
put
in
to
the
formal
written
confession
something
regarding
the
other
events
or
the
other
event
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
--
to
which
he'd
indicate
he
was
involved.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
on
the
7th
and
on
that
date
he
signed
it.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
no.
that
was
what
i
pointed
out
before.
there's
nothing
here
that
--
that
says
that
--
that
makes
you
think
they
held
him
till
he
signed
it.
i
mean
they
--
he
confessed,
they
held
him,
and
he
signed
it
but
they
didn't
hold
them
until
he
signed
it
in
the
events
that
he
kept
refusing
then
finally
he
signed.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
yes.
they
orally
talked
to
him,
i
believe
almost
everyday.
it
must
have
been
from
the
indications
in
the
record
mainly
about
other
offenses.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
no.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
they
can
only
hold
them
for
so
many
days
and
then
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
they
--
they
can
only
hold
them,
i
forget
for
how
long.
usually
it's
up
to
the
one
who's
being
held.
as
a
matter
of
practicality
if
he's
held
too
long,
he
presents
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
if
he
hasn't
have
any
form
of
charge.
i
might
say
that
at
this
time
of
course,
the
victim
hadn't
died
and
they
weren't
considering
apparently
criminal
charges.
the
--
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
there
was
a
robbery
which
has
resulted
in
a
juvenile
court,
a
judgment
of
delinquency
which
isn't
even
a
criminal
matter
in
colorado.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
oh
no.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
oh
no,
no.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
judgment
of
the
--
the
judgment
of
juvenile
delinquency
and
the
commitment
to
the
industrial
school
was
based
on
this
same
written
statement.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
it
was
after
the
7th
that
he
was
sent
to
the
industrial
school,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
they
didn't
use
it
immediately.
they
have
to
have
a
hearing
colorado
where
they
--
there's
a
complaint
of
delinquency,
as
called.
it
isn't
a
criminal
proceeding
and
then
he
is
not
convicted
of
a
crime.
he's
adjudged
to
juvenile
delinquent
or
isn't
adjudged
a
juvenile
delinquent.
and
he's
committed
to
one
of
the
institutions,
you
see.
and
all
of
that
proceeding
was
based
on
this
written
statement
along
with
the
oral
one.
then
about
two
weeks,
i
guess
after
he
was
so
adjudged
to
be
juvenile
delinquent,
the
victim
died
and
they
began
instituting
the
proceedings
to
try
him
for
murder
in
a
district
court.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
it
maybe,
your
honor,
that
that's
it
but
it
seems
to
me
somewhere
in
there,
he
said
that
he
signed
it
because
he
thought
he
was
told
that
they
would
let
him
out
of
security
and
go
home
if
he
did
sign
it,
that
they
would
keep
him
in
security
if
he
didn't.
i
believe
that's
in
there.
i
cannot
find
it
at
this
time.
that's
right
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
oh
yes.
yes,
the
record
is
complete.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
yes,
it's
all
continuous.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
apparently
your
honor,
it
isn't.
that
particular
indication
isn't
in
that
record.
i
can't
find
it
right
now.
i
would
have
to
research
the
entire
record,
but
i
can
find
only
the
ones
to
which
you
members
of
the
court
have
made
reference
right
now.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
feel
certain
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
i
cannot
have
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
there
it
is.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
then
he
says,
“did
anyone
say
anything
about
releasing
you
from
security?”
answer,
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
so
it's
confusing
to
say
the
least.
the
--
as
i
say
the
court
had
this
in
front
of
him
they
ruled
that
the
thing
was
voluntary.
the
defendant
did
not
choose
to
present
this
to
the
jury.
he
did
not
testify
in
front
of
this
jury,
but
the
jury
did
have
in
front
of
it
all
of
the
facts
that
he
chose
to
present
regarding
voluntariness
or
lack
of
voluntariness
of
this
confession.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
he
did.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
he
said
he
was
afraid
apparently
on
the
bottom.
not
in
terms
--
i
guess
not
because
they
told
him
but
he
was
just
afraid
that
he
would
be
kept
in
security
longer
if
he
didn't
sign
it.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
apparently
they
--
i
believe
it's
in
here
somewhere.
they
released
him
to
the
custody
of
parents
for
a
certain
time
between
that
time
and
the
time
he
was
brought
in
and
adjudged
to
be
a
juvenile
delinquent,
which
i
don't
think
it
was
more
than
a
week
or
10
days
after
from
the
time
of
that
statement.
now,
there
are
several
points
which
we
pointed
out
on
page
6
of
our
brief
which
we
feel
are
inaccurate
in
the
defendant's
brief.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
one
is
the
statement
that
he
was
kept
in
solitary
confinement.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
of
course
it
showed
that
he
was
kept
in
a
room
by
himself
that
he
was
allowed
to
eat
with
the
other
inmates
of
the
juvenile
hall.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that
the
room
all
alone,
not
with
the
other
boys,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that
there
is
no
indication
that
he
does
not.
they
called
it
a
room
on
itself.
they
don't
describe
what's
in
it.
they
say
he
is
allowed
to
go
out
of
there
and
go
to
eat
with
the
other
boys.
now,
we've
never
felt
that
this
add
it
up
to
the
usual
definition
of
solitary
confinement.
but
we
think
it's
misleading
to
say
what's
kept
in
solitary
confinement
because
there's
no
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
he
was
put
in
some
dark
room
all
by
himself
for
five
days
on
end
or
something
like
that
until
he's
signed.
it
shows
he
was
kept
in
this
room
by
himself
and
allowed
to
eat
with
the
other
inmates
of
juvenile
hall
during
that
five-day
period.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
at
one
point,
they
left
and
get
together.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
it's
--
it
isn't
consistent
with
the
usual
security,
but
apparently,
they
did
let
them
get
together
and
talk.
apparently
open,
they
would
discuss
it
among
themselves
at
--
after
the
youngest
one,
the
eight-year-old
confessed
and
let
him
go
up
to
the
roof
where
the
other
one
was
in
security.
and
they
violate
their
usual
rule
of
keeping
him
alone
and
let
them
get
together
and
then
heard
what
they
said
over
the
microphone.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
i'm
not
sure
if
that
was
eddie
and
richard,
or
robert.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
--
i
think
that
that
was
not
robert
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
--
richard
but
it
was
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
eddie
martinez
and
richard
gallegos.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
now,
this
is
only
relevant
you
see
as
to
whether
what
security
means.
obviously,
it
he
doesn't
mean
they
don't
see
anybody
else.
they
eat
with
the
other
inmates
and
at
times,
the
police
let
them
see
the
other
inmates
when
it's
to
their
own
demand.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
it
did.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
well,
that
was
at
the
time
the
three
was
still
at
--
on
trial.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
believe
that
was
brought
in
at
the
time
the
three
still
on
trial.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
all
three
were
originally
charged
but
the
eight
was
dropped
immediately,
you
see
the
eight-year-old.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
think
he
was
named
on
the
original
papers,
that's
right
but
it
was
dropped
immediately.
and
then
the
--
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
the
14
and
the
12
were
the
ones
that
actually
came
in
the
--
in
court
proceedings.
i
think
in
the
original
information
it
was
charged
though,
they
lifted
the
names
of
all
three
of
them
but
they
didn't
actually
ever
carry
out
in
proceedings
against
the
eight-year-old.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right,
in
colorado
it's
prosecuted
by
information.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
how
they
operate
to
know.
i
was
surprised
myself
when
i
read
this
record
because
it's
the
first
case
i
have
handled
that
related
to
someone
who
had
been
held
in
juvenile
hall.
but
they
apparently
have
a
room
spotted
and
can
hear
anything
they
want
to
by
turning
on
the
microphone.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i
assumed
from
the
record,
it
was
just
the
security
room
but
that
isn't
made
clear
for
sure.
you
can't
tell.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
of
that
sequence
you
have
there
is
right.
all
of
that
came
in.
now,
i
know
in
discussing
the
voluntariness
or
lack
of
it
of
gallegos'
statement,
mr.
vigil,
i
believe
again,
if
not
for
the
first
time
referred
back
to
this
bugging
room
with
two
boys
other
than
gallegos.
he
was
attempting
to
show
that
--
to
the
officer,
i
believe
they've
gotten
their
information
first
before
they
got
it
from
gallegos
and
then
placed
it
before
gallegos
to
sign
so
to
speak.
but
i
--
i'm
not
sure
if
there
was
anything
about
this
business
that
the
two
boys
were
choking
each
other
prior
to
the
time
martinez
was
dismissed,
the
case
against
--
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
well,
we've
already
shown
we
feel
a
lot
of
statement
that
defendant
was
kept
for
a
period
of
five
days
and
until
a
confession
was
signed.
it's
completely
misleading
because
if
--
you'd
get
the
impression
that
he
refused
and
refused
to
sign
and
they
kept
him
until
he
did.
we've
already
shown
that
he'd
signed
it
as
soon
as
if
the
written
one
was
placed
in
front
of
him
that
he
orally
confessed
as
soon
as
he
was
picked
up.
we
have
discussed
also
previously
the
statement
as
to
whether
or
not
he
has
the
mental
age
of
eight.
that
statement
appears
in
the
brief
doesn't
qualify.
there's
nothing
to
support
he
was
of
mental
age
of
eight.
their
psychologist
said
he
had
the
language
ability
of
eight
or
nine
but
he
has
the
overall
ability
of
10
or
11.
all
of
these
should
be
remembered
certainly.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
oh,
but
the
defendant
called
for
him.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
the
state
psychologist.
mr.
j.
f.
brauer,
jr.
that's
right.
and
as
to
whether
or
not
defendant
had
the
benefit
of
counsel,
we've
already
remarked
on
that.
now,
we
think
he
was
quite
thoroughly
and
repeatedly
advised.
the
defendant
cites
some
of
the
officers
who
said
they
did
not
advice
him.
well,
of
course,
every
officer
who
talked
to
him
didn't
have
to
say
you
can
have
counsel
in
order
for
him
to
be
advised.
this
isn't
a
conflict
in
the
record.
this
showed
that
some
officers
did
tell
him,
some
didn't
but
in
any
case,
he
was
certainly
advised.
the
most
unsupported
statement
we
feel
in
the
entire
brief
is
dependent
with
spanish
speaking
child.
there
is
nothing
to
support
that.
he
testified
out
of
the
presence
of
a
jury.
there's
no
interpreter.
all
the
police
officers
talked
about
their
conversations,
no
language
barrier
was
mentioned.
we
feel
that
that
isn't
a
support.
this
business
of
the
confession
since
it
is
the
real
important
point
of
this
case
is
what
we
have
elaborated
upon.
but
our
other
points
are
covered
in
the
brief.
