j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
--
these
kids
were
by
themselves
in
a
room
which
had
a
microphone
in
it,
the
kids
were
talking
and
the
officers
were
outside
the
room
and
heard
the
conversation
on
the
microphone,
was
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
167?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
haven't
seen
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
of
167.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
charles.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
you
say
the
doctors
didn't
but
the
psychologists
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
a
psychologist
a
doctor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
your
position
patient-relationship,
you
construct
this
from
the
fact
that
you
make
the
petition
for
the
appointment
of
these
doctors
to
examine
them,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
if
--
after
you've
got
the
results
of
those
examinations
as
just
as
if
you
had
retained
these
positions
for
that
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
they
could
not
then
have
testified
over
your
protest
because
that
would
have
violated
a
privilege,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
--
and
you
say
you
make
a
due
process
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
there
any
finding
at
any
stage
of
this
proceeding
in
the
state
courts
that
in
fact
this
did
establish
a
doctor-patient
relationship?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
apparently
your
state
supreme
court,
it
constituted
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
what
--
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
a
determination
of
the
meaning
of
your
statute
which
includes
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you're
not
--
you're
not
--
are
you
arguing
it's
been
applied
differently
in
other
cases
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
only
this
way
and
this
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
how
--
how
does
--
how
does
this
--
we
have
to
accept
the
colorado
supreme
court's
construction.
how
does
this
rise
to
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
think,
could
he
have
been
under
(inaudible)
as
an
adult
as
well?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
state
make
a
distinction
between
juvenile
defenders
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
regard
to
age?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
a
jury
fix
the
sentence
under
your
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
to
be
released,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
denied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
i
noticed
on
page
163
at
the
bottom,
robert
testified,
“i
signed
it
because
he
said
whether
we
told
the
truth
or
didn't
tell
the
truth,
he
is
going
to
send
us
to
the
industrial
school.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
had
the
impression
that
he
was
already
sentenced,
if
that's
the
right
word
to
the
industrial
school
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
this
robbery
charge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
happened
to
ask
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
it
was
after
the
7th
of
this,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
even
though
he
signed
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
we
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
release
him
from
security
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
all
three
tried
for
the
murder
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
proceeding
started
against
the
eight-year-old
as
well
as
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
offense
is
prosecuted
by
information
another
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
practice
to
bug
being
in
the
rules
of
juvenile
hall?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
eddie
martinez
was
the
12-year-old?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
beating
up
the
eight-year-old.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
robert
was
not
in
the
room
apparently.
richard
went
back
to
the
room
where
eddie
was
but
robert
was
not
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
i
gather
you
didn't
ask
for
the
testimony
to
be
stricken
after
eddie
and
richard
were
out
of
the
case
because
of
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
theory
that
the
police
got
this
information
overhearing
that
conversation
and
then
just
put
it
in
writing,
is
that
it?
they
had
robert
sign
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
but
what
i
was
getting
at
mr.
vigil
was
it
--
at
the
trial
i
gather
this
evidence
from
the
overheard
conversation
between
eddie
and
richard,
was
in
the
record
as
it
went
to
the
jury
against
robert,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you
didn't
ask
that
it'd
be
stricken.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nor
object
to
its
introduction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is,
you
never
asked
that
the
evidence,
the
overheard
conversation,
what
was
said
between
richard
and
eddie,
to
be
stricken
as
against
your
client.
