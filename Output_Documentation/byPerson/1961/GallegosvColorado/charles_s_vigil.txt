mr.
charles
s.
vigil
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
in
which
robert
elmer
gallegos,
the
petitioner
and
by
writ
of
certiorari
comes
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
colorado.
he
was
tried
in
the
district
court
in
the
city
and
county
of
denver
for
a
murder
during
--
train
during
a
robbery.
he
was
jointly
charged
with
eddie
martinez.
robert
elmer
gallegos
was
14
years
of
age
and
eddie
martinez
was
12
years
of
age.
the
case
against
eddie
martinez
during
the
course
of
the
trial
was
dismissed
because
of
the
fact
that
the
court
ruled
that
he
did
not
understand
the
nature
of
the
note.
the
court
further
heard
the
question
involving
the
admissibility
of
a
statement
taken
at
the
end
of
a
seven-day
period
in
security
and
in
the
juvenile
hall
in
the
city
and
county
of
denver
and
determined
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
very
well.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
this
case
started
by
an
investigation
by
the
denver
police
department
as
shown
in
exhibit
g
which
is
part
of
the
record,
i
think.
and
they
had
apparently
picked
up
at
least
one
other
individual
prior
to
the
time
that
surely
by
accident
in
accordance
with
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
chism
who
picked
up
these
boys
in
the
lower
section
of
denver
as
they
were
shining
shoes.
police
officer
chism
picked
them
up
and
the
record
will
show
that
after
picking
them
up,
he
immediately
took
them
to
juvenile
hall
and
the
next
day,
he
determined
that
there
were
three
boys
present
at
the
time.
it
was
bobby
gallegos,
his
brother,
charles
who
was
11
and
his
brother,
richard
who
was
eight.
and
in
accordance
with
what
was
done
at
that
time,
the
police
officer
interrogated
them
and
the
testimony
shows
that
after
the
interrogation
that
took
place
some
time
during
this
period
probably
on
the
3rd
of
january
of
1959,
that
a
charge
was
brought
in
the
juvenile
court
in
the
city
and
county
of
denver
and
at
that
time,
the
charge
that
was
brought
was
for
the
robbery
because
the
victim,
smith,
of
course,
was
still
living.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes,
in
the
juvenile
court.
in
that
case,
the
juvenile
judge
heard
the
proceedings
and
determined
that
the
boys
were
guilty.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
testimony
in
the
district
court
carried
this
forward
by
stating
that
they
had
admitted
their
guilt.
but
in
any
event,
the
court
sentenced
them
to
the
state
industrial
school
and
when
mr.
smith
died,
the
district
attorney
filed
a
charge
in
the
district
court
on
the
same
state
of
facts
except
for
the
one
fact
that
mr.
smith
had
died.
now,
the
death
certificate
showed
that
mr.
smith
had
died
from
pneumonia,
some
30
days
after
the
alleged
assault
that
had
occurred
on
december
the
20th
of
1958.
the
trial
occurred
on
june
the
9th
of
1959
or
started
on
that
day
and
during
the
trial,
the
evidence
indicated
that
the
facts
were
substantially
as
i've
stated
them.
the
--
the
attorney
general
appears
to
state
and
i
think
the
supreme
court
os
the
state
of
colorado
also
fears
to
state
this
although
no
dates
were
used
in
the
opinion,
that
immediately
upon
arrest,
that
bobby
gallegos
made
a
statement,
however,
the
record
will
dispute
this.
the
record
at
page
197
shows
that
officer
chism
was
questioned
starting
on
page
196
at
the
bottom.
question,
the
court
has
ruled,
you
may
testify
officer
as
to
the
conversation
you
had
with
robert
gallegos
on
the
occasion
that
is
on
the
evening
of
january
the
1st
at
19th
in
curtis
street.
answer,
he
admitted
to
me
the
conversation
began
in
regards
the
assault
on
robert
f.
smith
which
i
had
and
i'll
then
report
on
and
i
was
investigating.
in
talking
to
robert,
he
admitted
he
had
a
part
in
it.
question,
did
he
say
what
part
he
had
in
that?
answer,
he
didn't
at
first
and
that
is
the
reason
i
booked
him
in
juvenile
hall.
and
then
the
record
follows
at
page
199.
question,
this
conversation
occurred
on
january
the
2nd,
1959,
is
that
correct?
answer,
before
the
day
of
the
arrest
which
occurred
the
night
of
january
the
5th.
question,
what
happened
on
that
occasion?
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
he
was
actually
arrested
on
the
night
of
january
the
1st.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
was
new
year's
night
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
of
1959
and
was
taken
to
juvenile
hall
immediately
after
the
arrest
together
with
his
brother
charles
and
his
brother
richard.
and
the
answer
here
indicates
--
i
would
like
to
clarify
one
thing,
the
information
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
i
think
that
the
officer
is
mistaken
in
--
in
answering
this.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
and
i
think
that's
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
explanation
to
that.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes.
he
was
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
actually
arrested
on
january
the
1st.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
i
would
like
to
clarify
one
thing.
the
information
that
i
had
obtained,
i
sent
a
report
to
juvenile
court
on
this
first
information.
and
then
on
january
5th,
the
victim
or
the
other
so
identified
the
parties
at
juvenile
hall.
and
at
that
time,
upon
taking
the
other
victim
home,
i
was
called
to
juvenile
hall
that
richard
wanted
to
see
me.
that
is
when
he
told
me
about
the
assault
and
i
sent
an
additional
report
to
the
juvenile
court
at
that
time
indicating,
of
course,
this
was
january
the
5th
when
the
second
assault
which
involved
robert
smith
was
called
to
the
attention
of
officer
chism.
now,
we
follow
on
page
208,
at
the
top
of
the
page.
and
of
course,
that
witness
was
officer
miller
and
i
might
explain
here
that
officer
chism
was
the
officer
who
first
arrested
these
boys,
the
three
boys,
who
had
developed
later,
were
not
the
boys
that
he
wanted
that
is
all
three
of
them,
charles
was
released.
but
officer
miller
was
the
one
who
took
the
statement
at
the
police
station
on
the
7th.
and
the
question
that
was
asked
at
that
time
was
this.
question,
what
was
the
conversation?
answer,
i
told
robert
--
mr.
smith,
i
was
informed
mr.
smith,
who
was
in
critical
condition
at
denver
general
hospital
not
expected
to
live.
and
i
told
him
it
was
my
job
to
attempt
to
get
a
formal
statement
for
the
record
in
a
matter.
now,
the
obvious
thing
is
that
the
statement
on
that
date
was
taken
on
the
morning
of
january
the
7th
of
1959
that
indicates
that
no
statement
had
been
taken
prior
to
that
time.
now,
the
attorney
general
also
indicates
that
they
were
--
these
three
boys
who
were
picked
up,
i
might
point
out
here
also
that
eddie
martinez,
the
12-year-old,
was
not
picked
up
until
the
2nd
of
january,
although,
robert
and
charles
and
richard
gallegos
had
been
picked
up
on
the
1st
of
january.
but
because
of
the
fact
that
the
determination
was
made
to
charles
was
not
in
anyway
involved,
charles
was
released
and
taken
home.
and
eddie
martinez
was
picked
up
on
the
2nd
of
january
and
taken
to
juvenile
hall.
now
the
record
shows
that
so
far
as
eddie
martinez
was
concerned
and
i
refer
now
to
the
record
146,
and
this
witness
is
testifying,
and
the
court
asked
this
question.
the
court,
then
what
happened?
the
witness,
well,
as
i
say,
we
heard
eddie.
the
conversation
was,
“what
did
you
tell
that
guy?”
he
said,
“i
told
him
the
truth.
i
wanted
to
get
the
matter
straightened
out.”
and
we
heard
someone
say,
“you
brat!”
and
we
heard
a
scuffling
sound,
a
gurgling
sound,
and
we
ran
up.”
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that
was
the
witness.
the
police
officer
who
--
i
think
was
officer
miller
who
said
that.
and
this
testimony
that
he's
giving
comes
as
a
result
of
this
situation
that
exist
in
juvenile
hall.
they
have
microphones
in
each
one
of
these
security
rooms.
security
is
a
room
in
which
the
boys
are
kept
alone
and
not
allowed
to
talk
to
anybody,
although,
they
are
permitted
to
go
to
lunch
in
a
group
apparently.
but
the
officer
is
testifying
here
to
what
he
heard
over
this
microphone
after
they
had
talked
to
richard
who
was
eight
years
old.
richard
was
a
--
a
little
boy
who
was
undersized
in
any
event,
but
was
eight
years
of
age,
and
the
officers
had
kept
him
in.
this
statement
was
taken
--
this
statement
was
taken
on
january
the
3rd
of
1959.
and
of
course,
they
then
released
richard.
he
went
upstairs,
and
the
conversation
that
they
overheard
is
what
the
officer
is
relating.
and
he
goes
on
further
to
state
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
the
--
officer
miller
was
in
on
the
conversation
and
other
officers
in
the
juvenile
hall
were
overhearing
the
conversation
in
accordance
with
the
testimony
that
i
have
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
just
read.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well,
the
point
that
they're
making
is
this.
that
eddie
martinez
who
was
one
of
the
suspects
in
the
case
had
taken
richard
gallegos,
the
eight-year
old
and
was
choking
him,
and
he
states
this.
in
his
answer
to
another
question
which
follows
immediately
afterwards.
question,
when
you
were
listening
on
the
microphone
and
heard
someone
say
this,
you
indicated
it
was
eddie
martinez,
but
you
cannot
swear
he
said
this.
answer,
no,
but
i
can
say
it
was
eddie
martinez.
he
was
choking
richard
gallegos
when
i
ran
up
there.
in
other
words
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes.
he
said
that
that's
what
eddie
martinez
was
doing
because
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
richard
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that
is
correct.
however,
the
--
the
--
the
reason
that
i'm
reading
this
is
to
show
contrary
to
what
the
attorney
general
has
stated
that
no
statement
had
been
taken
by
the
police
officers
on
january
the
1st
when
these
boys
were
first
arrested.
and
the
reason
that
this
shows
that
is
because
the
officers
were
--
had
talked
to
richard
gallegos
on
this
night
when
they
released
him,
eddie
martinez
apparently
got
mad
because
of
the
fact
that
richard
gallegos
had
told
the
truth
as
he
said.
so
of
course
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
apparently
--
apparently
not.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
it
was
material
merely
to
show
that
no
statement
was
taken
which
is
what
i'm
attempting
to
show
here
and
no
statement
was
taken
at
the
beginning
of
the
time
that
was
involved
here.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
this
is
a
testimony
the
state
put
on.
however,
this
is
on
cross-examination
on
the
questions
that
i
had
asked.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
there
is
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
the
issue
can
again
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes,
it
was
but
not
in
--
in
all
of
its
detail.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well,
there
--
there
were
some
deficiencies,
i
would
say
in
the
submission
of
the
whole
hearing
before
the
jury,
but
in
any
event,
the
hearing
is
held.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
the
controverted
questions
of
facts
were
not
all
before
the
jury.
some
of
them
were
and
some
of
them
were
not.
and
the
controverted
question
of
fact,
for
example
would
--
appears
at
page
197,
was
before
the
jury
but
that
question
was
not
controverted.
that's
the
--
is
the
testimony
that
was
put
on
by
the
district
attorney.
the
question
being
whether
or
not,
bobby
gallegos
had
made
a
statement
on
january
the
1st
of
1959
when
he
was
arrested.
the
record
as
made
by
the
district
attorney
himself
indicates
that
bobby
gallegos
did
not
make
this
statement
because
the
witness
states
at
page
197,
in
response
to
the
answer,
he
didn't
at
first
and
that
is
the
reason
i
booked
him
in
juvenile
hall.
and
so
of
course,
the
district
attorney
himself
states
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
therefore;
this
witness
who
could
not
have
made
the
statement
when
he
was
first
arrested,
which
is
the
implication
and
the
fact
that
seems
to
follow
from
the
attorney
general's
argument
in
this
case
that
bobby
gallegos
immediately
made
a
statement.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
the
portion
that
i
have
just
read
from
page
197
was
before
the
jury
and
it
was
the
testimony
of
the
prosecution
as
it
presented
its
case.
now,
with
reference
to
the
matters
to
whether
or
not
this
--
this
boy,
robert
gallegos
had
counsel
or
whether
any
of
them
had
counsel.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
dispute
that
they
did
not
have
counsel
because
none
appeared
for
them
even
at
the
juvenile
court
hearing.
at
that
hearing
there
was
no
counsel
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
mother
attempted
to
see
her
son
on
january
the
2nd
and
went
to
juvenile
hall,
she
was
turned
away
and
told
that
she
could
not
see
him
with
the
explanation
that
he
was
under
investigation.
now
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
she
went
again
on
january
the
8th,
and
on
that
occasion,
she
was
permitted
to
see
him.
on
the
--
i
don't
think
she
went
again
because
she'd
been
told,
i
think
on
that
occasion,
that
she
could
only
see
her
son
on
visiting
days.
however;
the
record
shows
further
with
reference
to
this
and
this
is
on
cross-examination
on
page
211.
now
with
reference
to
your
first
request
as
to
whether
or
not
he
wanted
a
lawyer,
what
did
robert
say
to
that?
did
he
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
this
is
on
page
211,
the
bottom
of
the
page.
question,
now,
with
reference
to
your
first
request
as
to
whether
or
not
he
wanted
a
lawyer,
what
did
robert
say
to
that?
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
did
he
answer
it
at
all?
answer,
yes,
they
shook
their
heads.
i
mean,
they
gave
me
no
indication.
question,
so
when
you
asked
if
they
anted
their
parents,
they
shook
their
heads,
did
they?
answer,
they
didn't
indicate
they
wanted
them
there.
now,
i
think
through
the
record
it
--
it
appears
that
--
i
think
in
two
or
three
places
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
robert
and
eddie
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
martinez.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
eddie
was
12.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
those
were
the
only
two.
the
eight-year-old
under
the
law
in
colorado,
any
child
under
the
age
of
10
cannot
be
tried
and
a
child
under
the
age
or
up
to
the
age
of
14
must
know
the
difference
between
good
and
evil,
but
of
course,
is
another
point
which
is
involved
in
this
situation.
now
so
far
as
the
mental
capacity
of
robert
was
concerned,
robert
had
been
examined
by
a
psychologist
who
testified
before
the
jury
and
also
who
two
--
three
psychiatrists
had
examined
him.
now,
these
psychiatrists
had
been
appointed
upon
a
special
petition
before
the
trial
by
a
counsel
who
asked
that
psychiatrists
checked
these
children
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
should
follow
certain
procedures.
the
court
in
following
our
request
appointed
the
psychiatrist
and
afterwards,
the
psychiatrist
examined
these
children
and
presumably
for
reasons
of
their
own
made
reports
to
the
court.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
court
permitted
these
psychiatrists
or
at
least
one
of
them
to
testify
and
--
and
clearly
took
into
consideration
statements
that
were
made
by
the
psychiatrists.
and
the
attorney
general
in
his
brief
apparently
agrees
that
if
the
psychiatrist
did
testify
that
this
would
be
error
because
his
argument
is
simply
that
the
psychiatrist
did
not
testify.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
they
did
testify.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
the
record,
it
appears
at
page
167
and
172,
it
is
dr.
charles
a.
rymer.
the
testimony
of
the
doctors,
the
court,
i
will
make
it
clear
for
the
record,
calling
a
psychiatrist
has
nothing
to
do
whether
--
with
whether
or
not
the
boys
are
sane
or
insane.
the
statutes
provide
that
where
defendants
are
children,
they
must
know
the
distinction
between
good
and
evil.
and
the
question
of
sanity
or
insanity
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
under
the
statute,
the
court
has
to
know
and
it
has
to
be
shown
whether
they
know
the
distinction
between
good
and
evil.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes.
that's
the
judge
who
is
making
this
statement.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well,
let
me
see.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
maybe
its
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that's
record
170
--
170,
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
assuming
they
are
both
sane,
the
court
must
know
whether
they
know
the
distinction
between
good
and
evil.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
i
think
it's
at
record
170.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no,
this
is
the
court
who
is
talking
here.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
169
is
the
court's
statement.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that
is
correct.
now,
the
--
dr.
rymer
testified
at
170
and
i
think
at
172
or
174
is
the
statement
that
he
makes
that
he
examined
robert
gallegos
and
eddie
martinez.
now,
our
objection
to
this
is
quite
simple.
it's
the
fact
that
the
doctor's
testimony
should
not
have
been
considered
by
the
court
for
any
purpose
and
further
than
that,
the
doctor
could
not
say
even
that
he
had
examined
robert
gallegos
and
of
course
he
did
testify,
and
if
the
attorney
general's
conclusion
is
incorrect
insofar
as
the
record
is
concerned,
but
then
of
course
he
seems
to
admit
that
this
is
error.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
he
doesn't
testify
to
the
mental
capacity
of
robert.
he
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
testifies
that
he
examine
robert
gallegos.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
there
are
no
conclusions.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
he
didn't
tell
any
of
his
conclusions
except
for
the
fact
that
he
had
sent
a
report
to
the
court
and
the
court
has
previously
indicated
that
the
court
was
considering
these
letters
that
have
been
sent
to
the
court.
and
so
our
objection
as
to
the
courts
considering
these
letters
and
the
testimony
for
any
purpose
whatsoever
the
court
quite
obviously
used
these
letters
in
order
to
determine
the
question
in
the
statute
as
to
whether
or
not
these
children
knew
the
difference
between
good
and
evil.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no,
this
was
out
of
the
presence
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
of
the
jury.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
except
the
letters
that
were
sent
by
the
doctors
to
the
court.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
the
doctors
were
appointed
by
the
court
upon
a
special
petition.
there
was
no
plea
of
insanity.
it
was
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
a
special
petition.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well,
we
have
here
in
the
record
at
record
12
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes.
there
is
dr.
rymer
and
dr.
cohn,
and
then
on
page
14
as
the
letter
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
i
think
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
on
page
13,
dr.
rymer
reports
as
follows.
april
the
1st,
1959,
judge
h.
joseph
rowlands
and
judge
of
the
district
court,
city
and
county
building,
denver
to
colorado
regarding
robert
gallegos,
“dear
judge
rownson,
pursuant
to
your
request,
i
have
examined
the
above
names
at
juvenile
hall.
i
have
seen
robert
gallegos
on
four
occasions
and
wish
to
report
to
you
the
following
as
to
his
mental
condition.
it
is
my
opinion
that,
one,
robert
is
sane
at
the
time
--
that
he
was
sane
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
alleged
crime.
and
two,
that
he
is
able
to
distinguish
right
from
wrong
at
this
time
as
well
as
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
alleged
crime.
with
kindest,
this
personal
regards
are
humane.
very
sincerely
yours,
charles
a.
rymer,
md.”
on
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
the
point
i'm
making
is
this,
that
the
judge,
as
i've
indicated
before,
took
into
consideration
these
letters
in
determining
the
mental
condition
of
robert
gallegos
during
the
course
of
the
trial
and
also
permitted
dr.
rymer
to
testify
that
he
had
examined
robert
gallegos
over
our
objections.
in
addition
to
that,
he
had
other
letters
that
are
indicated
in
the
record
from
the
other
two
doctors
who
examined
bobby
gallegos.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
the
ground
of
my
objection
was
simply
this
that
there
was
a
doctor-patient
relationship
that
existed
because
this
was
based
upon
the
fact
and
that
is
the
appointment
of
the
doctors
who
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
we
had
made
a
special
petition
to
appoint
doctors
to
help
us
determine
what
course
to
take
in
this
case
and
not
base
upon
the
--
the
fact
that
the
boys
were
insane
or
any
claim
of
insanity.
and
therefore,
it
was
our
contention
that
this
could
not
come
under
the
usual
rule
that
in
an
insanity
plea
that
the
reports
are
made
to
the
court
and
--
that
the
court
can
use
them
or
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes,
i
have
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that's
--
that's
correct
but
i
didn't
examine
him.
i
think
that
it
could
--
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes.
that's
correct.
he
was
produced
as
a
witness
by
the
prosecution
and
not
by
the
defense.
we
did
not
produce
him
as
a
witness.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
objected
to
it
and
if
the
record
is
read
completely,
you'll
see
that
the
objection
appears
to
the
doctors
being
called
at
all
and
the
court
overruled
our
objection.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
psychologist,
the
doctors
do
not
state
that
but
the
psychologist
testifies
to
that.
the
psychologist
--
his
testimony
appears
in
the
record
and
he
testified
before
the
jury
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes,
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
i
think
he
probably
is
called
a
doctor
but
he
was
not
--
he
does
not
have
a
medical
degree
as
i
understood
his
testimony.
he
works
for
the
juvenile
court
and
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
his
name
is
chester
d.
perembur
and
he
testified,
in
his
testimony,
it
appears
in
record
263.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
he
was
a
psychiatrist,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no,
he
did
not
testify
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that's
correct.
that's
why
the
record
reads
but
that
that
record
is
incorrect.
he
was
not
called
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that
is
correct,
but
that
is
not
the
fact
of
the
matter.
he
was
not
called
by
the
defendant.
he
was
called
by
the
prosecution
or
by
the
court
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
determine
this
and
we
--
the
record
is
incorrect
to
that
extent
certainly
that
as
far
as
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
i
think
that
if
we
go
before
that
time,
you'll
see
at
page
168.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no,
at
the
bottom
of
that
page
and
you'll
see
mr.
rossman
who
was
assistant
district
attorney
trying
this
case
says,
“i
think
it
is
proper
to
have
a
ruling
on
the
point
right
now
on
the
objection
to
the
psychiatrists
testifying.”
mr.
vaio,
at
this
point
or
for
the
whole
trial.
the
court,
do
you
object
to
their
testifying
at
any
time
in
the
trial?
mr.
vaio,
that
is
correct.
the
court,
the
objection
is
overruled
and
he
proceeds
to
overrule
the
objection.
and
then
he
explains
himself
at
page
169
by
indicating
that
he
wants
to
make
it
clear
for
the
record
as
to
the
purpose
for
which
he
is
calling
the
psychiatrists.
and
so
the
court
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
the
connection
it
has
is
that
a
doctor
who
has
a
doctor-patient
relationship
with
any
person
who
cannot
testify
where
there
is
objection
made
to
his
testimony.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well,
i
think
it
would
be
due
process.
that's
my
conclusion
that
he
could
not
testify
because
the
defendant
would
be
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well,
he
did
not
testify
any
confessions
but
he
testified
to
a
point
that
we
felt
was
immaterial
which
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes,
to
his
mentality.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
exactly.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well
if
--
if
over
objection,
the
court
permits
this
testimony,
obviously
the
court
is
violating
what
i
consider
is
due
process
to
permit
a
doctor
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no,
i
don't
think.
i
think
the
court
did
not
rule
exactly
on
that.
there
was
no
ruling
on
that
basis.
i
think
the
court's
position
was
that
he
was
entitled
to,
that
is
the
judge
was
entitled
to
hear
this
testimony
for
the
reason
that
he
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
these
children
knew
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
under
the
colorado
statutes.
and
we
objected
to
that
because
this
was
a
material
point
in
the
case.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
i
think
that
that
is
early
in
the
--
there's
a
petition
and
at
the
first
part
of
this
record.
the
petition
appears
on
page
10
and
this
was
filed
on
february
the
17th
of
1959.
and
the
position
that
we
take
is
that
we
made
that
petition
as
a
special
petition
and
the
final
sentence
in
it
says,
so
that
the
psychiatrist
who
might
be
appointed
could
advice
with
counsel
as
to
the
condition
of
the
two
defendants,
both
of
whom
are
so
young
as
to
create
doubt
as
to
their
understanding.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
now,
there
was
a
question
as
to
the
psychologist,
chester,
d.
perembur
in
his
testimony
appears
in
the
record
263
and
he
stated
in
his
testimony
that
robert
gallegos
has
an
iq
of
70
on
a
verbal
scale.
he
speaks
the
language
of
a
child
you
might
expect
that
age
of
nine.
he
has
a
general
iq
of
83.
this
put
him
in
the
lower
range
of
intelligence.
i
would
say
he's
probably
functioning
at
the
level
one
might
expect
of
a
normal
child
of
11,
maybe
10.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no,
there
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
was
no
testimony
in
our
position.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
testimony
in
opposition
to
this
at
all.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
now,
the
next
point
that
we
have
is
the
question
involving
the
testimony
that
was
given
in
the
juvenile
court.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
same
testimony
that
was
given
in
juvenile
court
on
the
robbery
charge
where
robert
gallegos
was
sentenced
to
the
industrial
school,
it
was
the
same
testimony
that
is
exhibit
d.
it
was
the
same
testimony
that
was
used
in
the
district
court
to
convict
him
on
a
murder
charge.
now,
with
regard
to
that,
the
--
so
far
as
the
testimony
was
concerned,
there
was
no
dispute
that
this
was
the
same
testimony
and
that
it
was
used
in
the
juvenile
court
and
that
as
a
result
of
that,
robert
gallegos
was
sent
to
the
industrial
school
in
1959
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
january
of
1959.
thereafter
of
course,
when
mr.
smith
died,
he
was
tried
again
on
the
murder
charge
in
the
district
court
and
sentenced
to
the
state
penitentiary
for
life.
however;
he
was
kept
in
the
industrial
school
to
complete
his
term
on
the
robbery
charge
and
the
sentence
on
the
murder
charge
has
not
yet
taken
effect.
he's
being
held
in
county
jail
and
the
city-county
of
denver.
now,
so
far
as
the
position
that
we
take
there,
we
feel
that
because
of
the
statute
in
colorado
that
reached
clearly
that
this
evidence
cannot
be
used
in
any
other
court
or
in
any
other
proceeding
that
this
forecloses
the
state
in
using
this.
and
of
course,
we
have
quoted
the
statute
in
--
in
our
briefs.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well,
i
think
that
the
state
supreme
court
has
read
this
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
and
has
determined
there,
their
ruling
was
to
the
effect
that
the
only
thing
that
is
foreclosed
by
this
statute
was
a
transcript
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well
possibly,
it
does.
i
can't
say
that.
i
would
say
that
the
court
having
determined
this
is
not
following
the
statute
as
it
--
as
it
reads.
i
think
the
statute
is
very
clear
and
that
it
should
be
read
as
it
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
case.
this
statute
appears
in
almost
every
state
in
the
union
and
i
think
that
the
district
of
columbia
has
a
statute
that's
very
similar
to
it.
there
is
--
there
are
some
differences
in
it,
however.
but
generally
speaking,
the
testimony
that
is
used
in
the
juvenile
courts
could
not
be
used
anywhere
else.
and
the
case
of
harling
versus
the
united
states
which
is
--
comes
from
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
case
that
discusses
this
and
because
it's
a
matter
that
involves
a
child
of
16,
the
court
in
that
case,
i
think,
points
out
that
this
situation
is
such
that
the
juvenile
must
be
--
that
there's
a
sort
of
a
contracts
of
relationship
that
exists
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned.
now
so
far
as
the
construction
of
the
statute
in
colorado
is
concerned,
i
think
that
the
supreme
court
there
did
construe
it
and
my
view
is
that
this
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well,
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
it
violates
any
constitutional
provision
to
say
that
that
should
be
accepted
quite
frankly.
but
at
the
same
time,
i
feel
that
that
construction
is
not
in
conformity
with
what
the
law
states.
now,
the
last
point
that
we
have
is
a
point
involving
the
waiver
of
the
jury
trial.
we
requested
to
waive
a
jury
trial
in
this
case
from
any
reasons.
and
in
the
case,
we'd
also
filed
a
plea
of
former
jeopardy.
and
the
court
overruled
this
motion
to
waive
a
jury
trial
in
the
case
in
chief.
however;
on
the
plea
of
former
jeopardy,
the
court
heard
this
plea
of
former
jeopardy
without
a
jury.
now
of
course,
we
did
not
request
the
jury
nor
did
we
do
anything
about
having
the
jury
in
the
case,
because
in
that
particular
plea,
although
under
the
cases
in
colorado
in
pleas
of
former
jeopardy,
there
must
be
a
jury.
in
this
particular
situation,
there
was
no
jury
in
the
plea
of
former
jeopardy.
however,
when
the
trial
--
on
the
charge
itself
came
on,
the
court
insisted
that
there
must
be
a
jury
and
overruled
our
motion
or
a
waiver
of
the
jury.
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
the
court
please.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
matter,
there
were
several
statements
taken
that
were
written
and
i
have
previously
referred
to
exhibit
g.
this
exhibit
g
is
dated
on
january
the
3rd
of
1959
and
was
signed
by
two
officers
who
were
assigned
to
this
case,
j.s.
riggs
being
one
of
the
detectives
and
p.o.
chism,
being
the
other
one,
and
p.o.
chism
is
the
principle
witness
that
the
district
attorney
relied
upon
to
carry
forth
the
case
and
sat
beside
the
district
attorney
during
the
whole
trial.
and
p.o.
chism
is
the
man
who
testifies
and
whose
testimony
i
have
previously
alluded
at
page
197
in
complete
contradiction
to
the
statement
of
the
attorney
general
in
this
case.
because
at
page
197,
chism
states,
as
i've
stated
before,
“did
he
say
what
part
he
had
in
it?”
that's
the
question.
and
the
answer,
he
didn't
at
first
and
that
is
the
reason
i
booked
him
in
juvenile
hall.
so
obviously,
chism
didn't
get
any
statement
in
any
automobile
from
robert
gallegos.
that's
the
unqualified
statement
of
the
district
attorney's
witness.
and
the
other
statement
that
we
have
referred
to
is
the
fact
that
the
officers
on
january
the
3rd
were
listening
over
the
microphones
and
on
that
date,
because
richard
hadn't
apparently
told
the
truth
about
what
happened
as
the
testimony
shows
and
eddie
martinez
was
beating
him
up.
so
obviously,
they
had
not
secured
any
statement
until
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
eddie
martinez
was
the
12-year-old.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
he
was
beating
up
eddie
who
was
eight
years
old.
and
so
they
had
a
statement
at
that
time,
what
was
the
purpose
of
all
of
these.
but
more
than
that,
eddie
martinez
was
beating
up
richard
because
he
had
made
a
statement.
now,
exhibit
3
or
exhibit
g,
i
should
say,
with
just
the
exhibit
that
i
have
pointed
out
is
one
in
which
the
detectives
point
out
that
the
--
they
are
checking
two
offenses
that
apparently
occurred
by
their
own
exhibit
and
this
is
in
their
handwriting
on
december
the
19th
and
not
december
the
20th.
now,
there's
been
some
question
here
with
reference
to
what
does
release
from
security
mean.
well,
security
in
the
juvenile
hall
is
putting
a
boy
in
a
room
alone
where
he
cannot
see
anybody.
that's
the
testimony
in
this
record.
and
of
course,
releasing
from
security
means
simply
that
when
he's
released
from
security,
he's
permitted
to
mingle
around
with
the
other
boys
and
participate
in
the
activities
of
the
juvenile
hall.
now,
the
officers
knew
and
the
record
substantiates
this
that
when
they
took
a
boy
to
juvenile
hall
that
he
was
immediately
placed
in
security
for
at
least
24
hours.
and
of
course
when
we
talk
about
what
is
solitary,
i
would
like
to
know
what
solitary
is,
how
do
you
define
solitary?
does
that
mean
that
you
put
him
in
a
dark
room
or
you
kept
in
the
dungeon
of
some
kind?
i
don't
think
that's
contemplated
at
all.
solitary
and
we
all
know
this
from
any
military
experience
very
often
as
merely
being
put
in
a
room
where
you
can't
communicate
with
anybody
and
that's
all
what
it
means
to
anyone
i'm
sure.
and
of
course
in
this
case
when
we
have
children,
you
have
a
child,
eight
years
old,
one
12
and
one
14
and
they're
all
kept
in
solitary.
more
than
that,
the
officers
are
listening
over
microphones
to
get
statements
that
they
might
make.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well
as
--
as
it's
been
stated
here,
they
had
released
richard.
they
brought
richard
downstairs
at
juvenile
hall.
the
juvenile
hall
is
a
building
where
juveniles
are
kept
and
it
has
two
floors.
apparently,
they
brought
richard
downstairs
because
they
think
the
officers
states
that
richard
had
sent
word
to
him
that
he
wanted
to
talk
to
him.
well
of
course
when
he
came
out,
they
brought
richard
downstairs
and
they
talked
to
him.
and
then
of
course,
they
sent
him
back
upstairs.
apparently,
when
the
instructions
to
go
into
the
room
to
the
others,
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
in
any
event
the
--
it's
clear
that
somehow
or
another,
according
to
the
testimony
of
this
officer
that
they
did
hear
this
fight
going
on
over
the
microphone.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no,
robert
was
apparently
not
in
the
room
at
least
as
far
as
the
testimony
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
at
that
point?
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no,
the
--
the
case
of
course,
all
this
information
was
secured
prior
to
the
trial,
this
--
the
sequence
of
these
events
is
mr.
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
well,
i
think
previously
we
had
objected
and
the
page
196,
we
have
an
objection
that
the
court
overruled
and
the
objection
goes
to
the
question
of
permitting
the
officer
to
testify
at
all
as
to
any
oral
statements
or
alleged
oral
statements
because
the
court
had
had
this
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
determine
what
statements
are
going
to
be
admitted
and
ultimately,
the
court
determines
that
the
written
statement,
exhibit
d
could
be
admitted.
now,
there
were
numerous
exhibits
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
the
information
was
filed
originally
against
only
eddie
martinez
who
was
age
12
and
bobby
gallegos
who
was
age
14.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
yes.
bobby
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
gallegos
is
the
defendant
here.
a
child
at
the
age
of
eight
cannot
be
charged
in
colorado
with
any
offense
because
the
law
limits
the
age
to
age
10,
anyone
under
the
age
of
10.
now
we,
so
far
as
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
i
think,
yes.
i
know
he
was
in
error
with
regard
to
the
original
charge.
they
were
all
arrested
and
taken
to
juvenile
hall
but
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
the
youngster,
richard
martinez
or
richard
gallegos,
i
should
say,
was
not
charged
in
the
information
nor
was
he
charged
in
the
juvenile
court.
now,
so
far
as
the
testimony
of
bobby
gallegos
is
concerned,
this
was
not
presented
to
the
jury
at
all.
he
testified
in
the
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
so
i
think
counsel
for
the
people
in
this
case
was
in
error
with
regard
to
that
because
it
was
my
understanding
that
that
was
his
statement.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
oh
yes.
yes,
it
was.
and
we
did
not
call
him
to
testify.
he
could
have
testified
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
yes,
before
the
jury,
but
he
did
not
testify.
and
the
reason
i'm
stating
this
is
because
i
wanted
to
correct
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
--
argument
that
had
been
made.
now,
i
wanted
to
make
one
further
point
and
that
was
with
reference
to
the
combined
statements
that
were
taken.
now,
there's
been
some
indication
here
that
these
statements
were
not
combined.
the
original
statements
that
were
taken
were
combined
statements
and
the
reason
that
this
is
important
is
that
the
original
information
was
taken
from
this
eight-year-old
who
under
the
law
in
colorado
could
not
even
be
a
witness
because
a
child
at
the
age
of
10
--
under
the
age
of
10
is
considered
not
to
be
qualified
to
testify
unless
someone
can
establish
that
he
is
qualified.
in
this
case,
of
course,
no
one
ever
establish
this
particular
point,
but
the
statements
were
taken
from
this
eight-year-old
child.
now,
the
record
at
page
123
starts
with
these
questions.
well,
it
starts
at
the
bottom
of
page
122.
“where
did
you
take
them?”
“i
took
them
to
the
admitting
office
of
juvenile
hall.”
“did
they
put
them
in
solitary?”
“that
i
don't
know.”
“you
know
that
is
customary,
don't
you?”
“i
know
it
is
customary.”
“how
long
did
they
keep
them
there?”
“24
hours.”
“how
long
did
they
--
did
they
keep
these
boys?”
“i
don't
know.”
“they
--
they
keep
them
five
days
--
they
kept
them
five
days,
did
they
not?”
“did
they
question
them
there
all
five
days
while
they
were
there?”
answer,
aye,
more
or
less.
you
have
the
information
they
had
given
me.
you
have
here
what
has
been
--
marked
these
people
to
exhibit
a.
this
is
a
statement
that
you
stated
had
been
written
in
longhand
and
apparently
signed
by
all
three
of
these
boys.”
“yes
sir.”
“do
you
contend
this
is
a
joint
statement
made
by
all
of
them
at
once?”
“they
were
all
together.”
“you
don't
take
statements
that
way
normally,
do
you?”
“no,
that
was
just
the
information
more
or
less,
i
wanted
to.”
“normally,
you
take
the
statement
from
witnesses
one
at
a
time,
do
you
not?”
“normally,
yes.”
“in
this
case
--
instance,
all
three
made
the
statements
and
all
three
signed
it.”
“they
verified
it,
each
one
of
them.”
“what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is
the
statement
you
have
there,
isn't
the
statement
of
all
three
or
one
of
them?”
“actually
it
isn't
a
statement;
it
is
information.”
“is
it
the
information
from
all
three
or
what?”
“all
three.”
“so
you
combined
it
in
one
seat.”
“that
was
more
or
less
from
my
information
to
make
my
report.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
this
other
information
that
you
have
here
which
has
marked
people
to
exhibit
b
and
c,
is
that
correct?”
“yes.”
“it
is
information
from
all
three
except
for
the
short
note
and
that
is
just
the
information
from
the
two.”
and
now
i
continue
on
page
124.
“you
could
not
say
which
one
of
the
two
gave
you
the
information.”
“i
do
not
--
i
do
know
eddie
and
robert
was
the
only
ones
there.”
“that
is
people's
exhibit
c?"
”yes.”
“so
far
as
you
are
concern
then,
this
information
is
combined
information
from
all
three
as
far
as
exhibits
a
and
b
are
concerned
and
exhibit
c
is
from
two
of
them.
is
that
correct?”
"and
you
couldn't
say
which
one
of
the
boys
gave
you
the
information.”
“yes,
i
can.”
“you
can
pick
it
out
line
by
line.
i
know
exactly
what
happened
on
that
short
note.”
“yes,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
the
short
note.
i
am
talking
about
the
information
generally.”
“let's
confined
to
a
and
b,
can
you
pick
out
one
line
and
say
which
boy
told
you
that?”
answer,
i
don't
believe
i
could
pick
it
out.
so
i
think
that
shows
quite
clearly
that
these
exhibits,
so
far
as
a,
b,
and
c
which
were
the
original
statements
were
combined
information
which
is
what
we
have
stated
from
all
three
of
these
boys.
and
the
first
statement
that
was
taken
was
taken
from
the
eight-year-old
and
the
record
shows
that
this
was
taken
on
january
the
3rd
after
he
had
been
kept
in
solitary
confinement
for
a
period
of
at
least
two
days.
now,
there's
no
question
that
this
boy
was
taken
from
the
streets
of
denver
and
here
again,
there's
an
important
point.
it
was
a
sheer
accident
that
these
boys
were
picked
up.
at
the
record
at
page
150,
starting
at
the
top
of
the
page,
“now
with
reference
to
your
testimony
as
given,
can
you
state
whether
or
not
other
police
officers
interrogated
these
boys
or
talk
to
them
prior
to
your
doing
so.”
answer,
no,
sir,
i
had
no
knowledge
about
that.
question,
you
have
not
--
no
knowledge
of
that?
you
mean
the
state
then
that
it
happened
by
sheer
accident
that
you
happen
to
approach
these
boys
on
the
date
that
you
did?
answer,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no
--
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no.
the
law
of
the
state
is
that
the
judge
must
rule
as
to
whether
this
is
admissible
for
all
purposes.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
there
was
no
one
else
offered
this
evidence.
mr.
charles
s.
vigil
no
other
witnesses.
thank
you
very
much.
