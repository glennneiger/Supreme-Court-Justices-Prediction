what
was
the
occasion
for
his
being
picked
by
the
officer?
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
boy
alone
when
he
was
picked
or
was
with
anybody?
justice
potter
stewart
who
was
that?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
was
that
for
an
indefinite
term
or
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
is
a
two
--
a
two-step
procedure
in
his
trial
first
before
the
court
on
the
admissibility
of
the
written
confession
and
then
the
court
made
a
preliminary
ruling
that
it
was
--
that
it
can
go
to
the
jury
as
to
its
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
did
happen
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
from
what
page
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
139?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
on
223
here,
she
testified
and
i
understand
this
was
subsequently
stricken
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
so
it's
not
technically
part
of
the
record.
but
they
told
her
that
the
visiting
hours
were
on
mondays
and
thursdays,
but
she
couldn't
come
until
the
next
thursday
and
i
gather
that
the
following
monday
would
be
the
next
visiting
hours,
but
she
couldn't
come
on
monday
because
she
couldn't
come
--
it's
a
almost
a
week,
about
the
middle
of
the
page
a
little
below.
but
i
couldn't
see
him
until
thursday.
and
this
is
on
a
friday
evening,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
other
words,
she
couldn't
come
on
a
regular
visiting
hours
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
a
monday.
she
testified
that
they
told
her.
justice
potter
stewart
because
he
was
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
investigation.
justice
potter
stewart
almost
a
week.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
bottom
of
164,
he
said
i
was
scared
that
if
he
didn't
do
it,
they
would
keep
us
in
security
longer
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
--
there's
testimony
elsewhere
in
this
record
about
--
hearing
a
conversation
among
the
boys
over
the
microphone.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
couldn't
quite
see
how
that
was
consistent
with
the
securities.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
how
--
how
could
they
converse
if
they're
--
each
one
of
them
was
in
solitary?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
that
was
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
it
was
your
option
or
his
option
that
he
did
not
testify
before
a
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
