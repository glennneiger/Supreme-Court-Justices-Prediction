no,
what
boys
were

asking
about
there,
robert

else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
eddie
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
robert

the
only
two
there.
chief

earl
warren
alright
(voice

--
chief
justice

testimony.
what's
the
--
chief

earl
warren
but
did
--
where
is
it
that
he
testifies
to
the
mental
capacity
of
robert?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
where
are
the
conclusions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
say,
that
he
just
examined?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
he
didn't
tell

chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
out
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
presence
of
the
jury.
chief
justice
earl

chief

earl
warren
these
doctors
appointed
by
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
where
will
we
find
in
the
record
what
--
what
these
doctors
said
either
in
their
evidence
or
--
or
in
their
record
as
to
the
mental
capacity
or
the
mental
age
of
robert?
chief
justice
earl
warren
page
12?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
that
--
what
does
that
say?
there
isn't
anything
there
that
they
have
reported,
anything
affecting
their
--
mental
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
age
of
robert.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
is
there
anything
in
this
record
from
any
of
these
doctors
showing
what
mental
age
of
robert
gallegos
is?
and
if
so,
where
is
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
in
the
record
will
we
find
what
you
ask
for
when
you
ask
the
court
to
appoint
these
doctors?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
testimony
in
opposition
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
state
put
on
any
--
any
testimony
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
mr.
vigil.
mr.
brauer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
brauer,
what
--
what
did
the
testimony
show
as
to
the
age
of
robert
insofar
as
his
ability
to
communicate
was
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
as
i
understood
--
as
i
understood,
his
general
mental
age
was
--
was
of
11
--
between
10
and
11.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
didn't
they
also
make
some
distinction
as
to
his
powers
of
communicating
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
being
articulate,
didn't
they
give
him
a
mental
age
as
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
it
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
eight
or
nine-year-old.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they're
in
an
industrial
school
to
reach
the
age
of
18
and
they
transferred
them
then
to
some
other
institution.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
kind
of
an
institution
do
they
have
the
power
to
transfer
them
to
when
they
do
right
at
the
age
of
18?
chief
justice
earl
warren
surely
if
delinquent
--
a
juvenile
is
delinquent
the
court
doesn't
lose
its
jurisdiction
over
him
at
18
years
of
age,
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
--
you
--
you
have
other
institutions
to
which
he
can
under
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
his
mother
came
and
they
wouldn't
let
her
see
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
the
first
time
she
came?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
be
the
second.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
would
it
be
if
she
came
on
friday
night,
how
long
will
it
be
until
she
could
see
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
in
the
mean
time,
he
was
kept
incommunicado?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what's
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
his
mother
came
and
she
couldn't
get
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
won't
they
let
--
in
your
juvenile
hall,
won't
they
normally
let
the
mother
in
to
see
a
14-year-old
boy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
normally,
what
do
they
do
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
we're
dealing
with
the
pretty
young
boy
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
14
years
with
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mental
age
of
11
and
power
of
communication
of
an
eight-year-old
child.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
they
introduced
the
written
one
then
if
they
already
have
it
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
you
have
a
voluntary
statement
and
then
hold
--
hold
the
person
incommunicado
until
he
--
he
makes
a
written
statement
and
then
you
introduce
the
written
statement,
is
that
--
is
that
good?
is
it
really
involuntary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
might
not
be
this
way
that
they
got
some
kind
of
a
statement
from
him
but
it
might
not
have
been
satisfactory.
they
wanted
more
and
they
want
it
in
written
form.
they
want
to
make
it
more
graphic
for
the
jury
so
they
held
him
and
held
him
incommunicado
until
he
would
sign
it.
i
don't
say
that
happened
but
i
say
it
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
could
well
happened.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say
why
he
signed
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
only
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
can
you
take
the
forced
confession
and
then
corroborate
it
and
--
and
validate
it
in
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
no,
no,
no,
not
the
one
that's
false.
i
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
forced.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
the
--
what
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
a
confession
was
true
or
false?
whether
the
confession
is
true
or
false,
you
can't
--
you
can't
introduce
this
if
it's
coerced.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
mean
when
he
said
--
if
they
wanted
to
get
the
things
straightened
out,
he
was
there
to
get
a
statement.
what
do
you
mean
by
if
they
wanted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
be
straightened
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
mean
in
this
testimony
of
his
when
he
said
if
you
want
to
get
this
thing
straightened
out,
now
you
can
tell
me
the
story.
is
there
anything
in
that
testimony
to
indicate
that
he
was
talking
about
the
other
crimes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
the
law
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
she
did
go
down
to
see
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
how
many
days
was
it
after
he
was
arrested
that
he
signed
a
written
confession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
six
days.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
his
mother
put
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
although
the
officers
told
him
when
he
was
incommunicado
that
he
could
see
his
mother
or
see
a
lawyer,
the
authorities
themselves
told
the
mother
that
she
couldn't
see
him
for
six
days?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
that
bears
on
whether
it's
free
and
voluntary
when
you're
dealing
with
a
14-year-old
boy
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
who
has
a
mental
age
of
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
power
of
communication
of
a
child
eight
years
old?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we're
dealing
--
dealing
with
the
whole
life
of
a
boy
here,
he's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he's
imprisoned
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
see
him
on
various
occasions
and
talk
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
law
in
colorado
that
requires
a
person
who's
arrested
and
charged
with
crime
to
--
accused
of
crime
to
be
taken
before
a
magistrate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
don't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
have
any
right
to
be
taken
before
a
magistrate
and
arraign
then
go
to
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl

i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice

it
was
a
robbery.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
one
in
here.
i
think
i
--
i
read
it
where
he
--
he
says
the
reason
he
did
it
was
because
he'd
have
to

they
told
him
he'd
have
to
stay
in

--
security,

think
i've
seen
it

myself
but
i
cannot

chief

i
just
got
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
robert
there
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
way
i
understood
the
counsel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
was
that
--
was
that
before
the
jury
--
did
that
go
before
the
jury
of
that
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
wondering
how
that
got
in
to
the
testimony
of
these
other
two
boys
having
a
conversation
when
he
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
it,
eddie
martinez
who
is
12
years
old
was
also
charged
with
this
--
this
murder
and
he
was
kept
in
the
case
until
the
doctors
had
given
this
testimony
about
him
choking
the
other
little
boy
and
hearing
the
gurgling
and
so
forth
over
this
microphone
that
you
have
in
the
room.
and
then
after
that,
the
doctor
said
that
he
was
unable
to
distinguish
right
and
wrong
so
--
so
they
dropped
him
out
of
the
case
and
let
the
testimony
in
against
this
boy.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
was
a
psychologist
of
the
juvenile
department,
the
states
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes,
he
called
him.
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
he
was
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
there
was
state
psychologist,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
brauer.
mr.
vigil.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
--
so
counsel
was
in
there
when
he
said
they
were
all
originally
charged.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
