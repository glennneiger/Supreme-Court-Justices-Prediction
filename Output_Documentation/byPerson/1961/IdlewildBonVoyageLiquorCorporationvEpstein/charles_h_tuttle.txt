mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
also
on
applications
for
mandamus
running
separately
to
district
court
judges
bicks
and
dimock
and
cashin
under
circumstances,
i
will
explain
in
a
moment.
the
heart
of
this
case,
your
honors,
is
i
think
summed
up
in
a
single
sentence
in
the
opinion
by
judge
dimock
when
the
matter
was
before
him
and
that
sentence
is,
?plaintiff
slightly
raises
a
serious
legal
question
when
it
states
that
what
new
york
is
regarding
as
unlawful
has
been
ruled
by
the
united
states
to
be
a
lawful
foreign
commerce.?
now,
there's
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts.
they're
all
stated
in
--
at
the
end
of
the
complaint.
the
only
response
from
the
defendants
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
sufficiency,
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
lack
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
the
complaint
invokes
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
under
section
1337
of
the
code
over
cases
arising
under
acts
of
congress,
regulating
foreign
commerce.
the
complaint
after
stating
the
relation
and
--
of
the
plaintiff
and
its
integration
into
the
plan
for
foreign
commerce,
set
forth
in
sections
311
of
the
tariff
act
of
1930
and
in
section
5301
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
goes
on
to
state
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
had
ruled
that
the
business
conducted
by
the
plaintiff
so
integrated,
was
illegal
and
that
the
liquor
authority
of
new
york
had
in
consequence
informed
the
plaintiff
that
its
business
was
illegal
and
had
threatened
it
with
civil
injunction
and
with
criminal
prosecution
under
the
alcohol-beverage
control
law
of
new
york.
now,
the
complaint
contained
in
consequence,
four
prayers,
one
for
injunctions,
temporary
and
permanent,
two,
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
three,
for
a
three-judge
court
and
four,
for
a
restraining
order
pending
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court
because
of
the
immediate
irreparable
damage
it
was
suffering
in
consequence
of
the
promulgation
and
publicity
of
the
attorney
general's
opinion.
the
plaintiff
accompanied
its
complaint
with
motions
for
injunction
and
for
a
three-judge
court
and
the
restraining
order.
now,
the
motion
by
the
defendant
for
a
dismissal
and
the
motion
by
the
--
motions
by
the
plaintiffs
which
i've
just
stated
all
came
on
before
judge
bicks
whose
opinion
is
at
page
49
of
the
record.
in
that
opinion,
he
has
summarized
correctly
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
as
to
the
nature
of
the
plaintiff's
business.
your
honors
will
find
them
at
page
49
and
50.
he
stated
in
his
opinion
that
the
?plaintiff
complies
with
section
311
of
the
tariff
act
of
1930
and
with
5301
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
with
all
the
regulations
promulgated
pursuant
thereto,?
nevertheless,
judge
bicks
refused
all
motions.
he
instead
reserved
jurisdiction
pending
rulings
of
a
filed
character
by
the
state
court
in
an
action
not
then
pending
at
all
and
not
contemplated
by
the
plaintiff
as
to
the
policy
of
the
state
alcohol
beverage
control
law
in
this
situation
and
he
refused
even
a
restraining
order
to
protect
the
plaintiff
pending
the
institution
of
an
action
that
was
not
then
yet
--
then
pending.
notwithstanding,
he
refused
the
restraining
order,
notwithstanding,
?that
plaintiff
has
not
since,
meaning
since
the
promulgation
of
the
attorney
general's
opinion,
been
able
to
make
purchases
to
meet
its
requirements
and
plaintiff
faces
the
prospect
of
closing
its
doors
with
consequent
substantial
damage.?
now,
the
complaint
reinforced
that
statement
by
judge
bicks
with
pointing
to
--
also
to
the
fact
that
it's
lease
from
the
port
authority
at
idlewild
airport
where
its
sole
business
is
conducted,
was
cancellable
by
the
port
authority
if
--
if
the
plaintiff
ceased
doing
business
because
the
port
authority
had
a
percentage
of
the
gross
profits,
and
that
said
the
complaint,
the
plaintiff
was
in
consequence
faced
with
the
prospect
of
immediate
bankruptcy.
now,
the
practical
effect,
your
honor,
of
judge
bicks'
decision
so
far
as
this
plaintiff
was
concerned,
was
as
the
court
of
appeals
later
pointed
out,
a
dismissal.
the
plaintiff
was
out
of
court.
it
was
denied
or
relieved
and
it
was
just
as
if
the
--
judge
bicks
had
in
times
dismissed
the
complaint
and
said,
?you
come
back
to
us
after
you've
instituted
and
conducted
a
state
court
proceeding
to
final
judgment
in
determination.
now,
then
as
soon
as
that
decision
by
judge
bicks
came
down,
the
port
authority
went
right
at
it,
i
don't
mean
the
port
authority,
the
liquor
authority
went
right
at
it.
they
communicated
with
the
interstate
bonded
truckers
that
brought
the
liquor
from
the
class
vi
united
states
government
bonded
warehouses
and
told
them
that
if
they
continue
to
bring
any
of
the
wines
and
liquors,
they
would
be
prosecuted
and
their
licenses
would
be
revoked
by
the
liquor
authority.
they
also
served
a
subpoena
for
all
our
books
and
records
to
be
brought
before
the
liquor
authority
and
in
addition
they
renewed
their
threats
of
civil
and
criminal
prosecution
against
the
plaintiff.
we
therefore
took
an
appeal
?
oh!
no,
we
therefore,
before
appealing,
bringing
the
appeal
forward,
we'd
already
appealed
as
soon
as
judge
bicks
came
down
with
his
decision.
we
applied
to
judge
dimock
because
of
the
absence
of
any
three-judge
court
to
make
our
application
to,
we
applied
to
judge
dimock,
saying
that
the
situation
had
now
developed
to
a
point
where
we
must
renew
before
him,
all
the
motions
we
had
on
before
judge
bicks
and
we
said
that
the
reinforcement
of
the
militancy
of
the
liquor
authority
put
us
to
the
point
where
we
were
just
out
of
business.
we
had
to
stop.
judge
bicks'
opinion
is
at
page
88
of
the
record
and
it
amounts
to
a
statement
that
he
felt
constrained
out
of
comity
to
follow
the
said
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes.
yes,
judge
dimock's
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
judge
bicks
was
the
first
judge.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes
sir
and
judge
dimock
said
that
he
felt
constrained
to
follow
the
decision
of
judge
bicks.
we
thereupon
brought
on
our
appeal.
judge
bicks
--
dimock
did
however,
grant
us
a
temporary
restraining
order
pending
the
hearing
of
our
appeal
so
that
we
were
still
in
business
when
we
were
before
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
will
be
found
at
page
103
of
the
record,
stated
that
judge
bicks
and
judge
dimock
had
no
jurisdiction
whatever
to
make
the
dispositions
which
they
made,
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
to
do
anything
except
convene
a
three-judge
court
and
that
interpreting
as
they
did
to
stratton
case
in
this,
decided
by
this
court
282,
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
and
it
consequently
granted
the
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
in
toto
without
even
thinking
as
this
court
has
in
the
phillips
case,
the
other
cases
cited
just
the
other
day
and
the
bailey
decision
by
this
court,
the
orders
of
bicks
and
--
judge
bicks
and
judge
dimock
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
pronounced
to
be
in
excessive
jurisdiction,
without
jurisdiction
and
therefore
void.
now,
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
wound
up
with
this
extraordinary
statement.
this
result
leaves
us
in
a
somewhat
anomalous
position.
the
results
we
reached
are
unhappy
ones.
we
are
refusing
access
to
our
court
to
a
party
who
we
believe
is
entitled
to
relief.
nevertheless,
as
i
say,
they
did
not
even
vacate
the
orders
which
they
were
pronouncing
in
their
opinion
to
be
void.
that
opinion
coming
down
we
--
and
to
stay
pending
appeal
being
thereby
vacated,
we
rushed
in
before
judge
cashin
and
we
said
now,
?here
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
declaring
that
these
orders
of
the
two
proceeding
district
judges
are
void?
because
that's
the
consequence
of
being
made
without
jurisdiction,
we
renew
everything
before
you
and
his
opinion
will
be
found
at
section
120
as
extraordinary
in
this
respect.
he
said
that
everything
that
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
had
said
about
the
orders
being
without
jurisdiction
well,
dictum
and
that
consequently
the
orders
that
had
been
added
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
without
jurisdiction
was
still
the
law
of
the
case
and
still
in
effect
and
out
of
comity
he
was
obliged
to
go
along
with
it.
that
left
us
where
the
--
but
one
cause
and
that
was
to
come
to
this
court
and
we
got
a
stay
from
mr.
justice
harlan
pending
the
hearing
of
this
appeal.
now,
a
word
as
to
our
business,
the
complaint
describes
it
fully
and
without
contradiction.
our
sole
business
is
conducted
under
the
constant
supervision
and
control
of
the
u.s.
bureau
of
customs
acting
as
part
of
the
treasury
department
in
turn
acting
under
the
plan
set
forth
in
section
311
of
the
tariff
act
and
section
5301
of
the
code.
its
sole
business
is
export
of
wines
and
liquors
in
the
original
package.
these
bottles
are
all
bought
in
the
u.s.
class
vi
custom
warehouse,
government
warehouses
at
the
very
starting
point
where
they
are
manufactured
as
bottle
for
export
from
the
u.s.a.,
that's
on
every
bottle
as
it
comes
to
us.
now,
it
is
brought
in
to
us
under
these
two
federal
statutes
for
re-warehousing,
that's
the
word,
re-warehousing
on
our
leased
premises
in
idlewild.
by
that,
it's
meant
there
is
under
direction
of
the
bureau
of
customs,
a
huge
portion
of
our
space
set
forth
and
contained
under
lock
and
key.
we
don't
have
any
access
to
it.
these
bottles
so
bought,
go
directly
into
that
big
safe,
as
it
were,
under
the
control
of
the
u.s.
bureau
of
customs
who
has
the
sole
key
to
it.
the
perspective
passenger
must
be
a
passenger
on
a
non-stop
plane
to
a
foreign
country.
nothing
can
be
done
if
there's
going
to
be
a
stop
elsewhere
in
this
country.
now,
that
passenger
lays
down
his
money
for
such
number
of
bottles
as
the
foreign
country
will
allow
under
reciprocal
arrangements
made
with
our
government
to
be
imported
there
duty
free
because
these
bottles
go
out
from
us
tax
free
and
duty
free.
and
they
are
largely
for
the
use
of
the
economy
passengers
who
--
because
of
this
plan,
this
federal
plan
for
export
and
reciprocity
with
foreign
nations
so
as
to
improve
our
trade
abroad,
enables
the
economy
passenger
to
buy
one,
two
or
three
bottles
not
more
than
that
unless
the
foreign
country
would
allow
more
to
get
in
duty
free
there,
for
$3
instead
of
what
otherwise
he
would
have
to
buy
somewhere
else
for
$7.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
no,
i
have
just
about
to
say.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
this
is
a
little
narrative
and
i'm
coming
at
last
to
the
foreign
country.
we
don't
put
these
on
the
plane.
the
united
states
customs
authority
writes
out
the
necessary
export
documents.
the
warehouse
in
our
premises
is
opened
by
them
and
with
these
documents
the
bottles
are
taken
and
delivered
to
the
purser
of
the
nonstop
plane
and
those
documents
require
that
those
bottles
be
new
--
not
delivered
to
the
passenger
until
that
plane
has
arrived
in
the
foreign
country
and
the
passenger
has
been
brought,
he
is
now
on
foreign
soil
when
the
purser
comes
along
and
says,
?the
label
on
the
bottle
is
now
fulfilled.
export
from
the
u.s.a.
has
been
fully
accomplished.
?now,
it
so
happens
that
this
very
section
311
in
the
gulf
oil
case
in
309
has
been
before
this
court
and
state
as
being
within
the
exclusive
power
of
the
united
states
not
a
preemptive
question.
it's
not
a
conflict
question.
it's
a
--
exercise
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
an
area
where
alone
the
federal
government
has
any
jurisdiction
and
this
court
said
that
the
purpose
was
to
enable
the
american
manufacturers
to
compete
both
favorably
with
their
foreign
competitors
without
any
substantial
loss
of
revenue.
now,
at
the
conclusion
of
his
opinion,
judge
bicks
summarized
these
regulations
and
statutes
very
fairly
and
yet
he
doesn't
give
the
force
to
them
which
the
old
summarization
necessarily
expresses.
he
says,
the
treasury
department
has
expressly
approved
these
proceedings
and
has
ruled
that
sale
so
consummated,
constitute
an
exportation
of
merchandise
within
the
meaning
of
section
311
of
the
tariff
act.
now,
i'm
going
to
ask
your
honors
to
see
how
the
attorney
general's
opinion
in
this
case
pinpoints
the
issue.
you'll
find
that
opinion
on
page
21
of
the
record
and
it
makes
five
concessions
which
higher
urge
are
of
great
materiality
here
in
pinpointing
the
real
issue.
first
and
i
quote
verbatim,
?first,
this
transaction
is
an
export
within
the
meaning
of
section
311
of
the
tariff
act.?
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
page
21
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
i
didn't
mention
the
21(a),
yes
sir
i
should've.
this
transaction
is
an
export
within
the
meaning
of
section
311
of
the
tariff
act.
in
other
words,
the
attorney
general
himself
recognizes
that
this,
this
bottle
dedicated
for
all
time
for
export
only
in
the
place
where
the
manufacture
occurred
under
government
control
is
for
export
only.
second,
he
says,
?the
liquor
will
remain
under
bond
and
under
supervision
of
the
bureau
of
custom
at
all
times.?
i
think
from
my
description,
you'll
see
how
true
that
is.
third,
he
says,
?delivery
is
not
made
within
the
state,
delivery
is
not
made
within
the
state?
and
it's
not
made
to
the
passenger
until
he
reaches
his
foreign
destination.
fourth,
he
--
the
attorney
general
concedes
that
this
is
not
a
sale
for
consumption
on
the
premises
and
that
means
of
course
for
consumption
in
the
state.
now,
the
reasoning
of
the
attorney
general
is
very
curious
and
i'm
about
to
show
you
that
is
directly
opposed
to
the
ruling
of
the
new
york
state
tax
department.
he
says
that
the
alcohol
beverage
control
law
of
new
york
contains
no
provision
for
licensing
a
business
such
of
ours
which
is
connected
in
this
way
with
foreign
commerce.
and
in
as
much
as
there
being
no
possibility
of
a
license
because
the
statute
doesn't
authorize
license,
we
are
necessarily
illegal
because
a
sale
and
he
calls
this
a
sale
in
the
state
of
new
york,
without
a
license
is
per
se
illegal
subject
to
injunction
and
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
now,
i
think
where
the
attorney
general's
assistant
who
wrote
that
opinion
over
looked
the
fact
that
the
legislature
do
more
about
this
than
apparently
the
attorney
general
did
and
did
not
make
a
provision
for
licensing
business
such
of
ours
because
the
legislature
realized
that
it
was
in
foreign
commerce
and
therefore
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
new
york
at
all.
now,
the
state
tax
department
which,
if
this
was
a
sale
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
new
york,
would
have
not
only
the
right
but
the
duty
to
impose
a
tax,
has
ruled
just
the
opposite
and
i
quote,
it
says,
you'll
find
it
on
page
26
of
the
record
that
from
the
tax
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
new
york
on
alcoholic
wines
and
liquors
there
must
be
accepted
sales
in
united
states
customs
bond
which
of
course
this
is.
there
must
be
accepted
sales
of
wines
and
liquors
where
the
merchandise
is
stored
in
class
vi
warehouse
under
general
regulations.
well,
our
premises
has
this
warehouse
right
in
it
to
which
we
have
no
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
what's
that?
class
vi
warehouse
is
described
your
honors
in
tariff
--
in
section
311.
it's
a
warehouse
which
is
solely
under
the
control
and
supervision
of
the
united
states
government.
the
liquor
in
its
raw
form
is
put
together
in
these
bottles
there
under
government
control
and
then
stored
there
under
government
control
to
be
withdrawn
for
export
in
the
way
i
have
described?
and
that
(voice
overlap)
the
same
class
vi
warehouse
is
a
phrase
in
the
section
311.
now,
then
that
being
so,
i
will
read
these
exceptions
again,
you'll
see
that
all
three
of
them
apply
to
us
says
the
tax
department.
one,
it
accepts
sales
in
united
states
customs
bonds,
second,
it
say,
it
accepts
sales
of
wines
and
liquors
rather
the
merchandise
is
stored
in
class
vi
warehouse
under
general
regulations
and
it
accepts
wines
and
liquors
when
sold
under
such
circumstances
that
this
state,
state
of
new
york
is
without
power
to
impose
such
a
tax.
well,
here
is
a
direct
conflict
between
two
departments
of
the
state
operating
simultaneously.
now,
i
--
i
wish
to
submit
that
the
underlying
issues
in
this
case
as
we
see
them
i
have
i
think
become
manufacturer
from
what
i
have
stated.
first,
our
position
is
that
plaintiff
is
a
federally
sanctioned
and
integrated
implementation
for
a
national
purpose
of
a
congressional
regulatory
plan
for
foreign
commerce
and
trade
reciprocity
with
a
foreign
government.
and
that
it
follows
that
such
plan
and
the
implementations
of
it
enacted
by
and
authorized
by
the
congress
are
in
an
area
of
national
jurisdiction
in
which
new
york
has
no
jurisdiction.
but
even
if
we
in
past
decide
from
the
--
the
question
that
new
york
had
no
jurisdiction
and
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
might
be
duality
of
jurisdiction,
nevertheless,
the
purpose
of
the
federal
statue
would
be
clearly
preempted
and
therefore
exclusive
in
that
sense
and
that
i
say
finally
in
conclusion
on
these
statements
of
our
positions
of
the
district
court's
act,
all
three
of
these
judges,
the
last
two
simply
following
the
trail
of
the
first,
in
abstaining
from
all
protection,
denying
everything
until
some
state
court
adjudication
of
finality
might
be
made
in
an
action
not
even
then
existing
was
and
i
speak
respectfully
of
the
lower
court,
abdication
of
the
--
its
original
jurisdiction
conferred
by
section
1937
of
the
code,
all
the
cases
under
acts
of
congress
regulating
foreign
commerce
and
i
quote
the
words
of
the
section.
and
that
section
was
enacted
for
the
very
purpose
of
conferring
on
the
federal
courts
not
only
the
right
but
the
duty
of
vindicating
the
acts
of
congress
and
the
national
purposes
reflected
therein
vindicating
from
state
conflict.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
surprisingly
it
is.
i
say
surprisingly
because
notwithstanding
all
the
litigation
that
we
had
below,
three
federal
district
judges,
a
court
of
appeals
divided
two
to
one,
an
application
by
us
here
for
these
rights
in
this
court,
a
brief
in
opposition
from
my
friend
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
not
mentioned.
it
is
sprung
on
us
in
the
--
i'll
use
that
term
politely,
it
is
sprung
on
us
in
their
brief
in
this
court
and
i
had
intended
to
come
to
it
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
it
is,
it
is,
i
recognize
now
in
the
case
put
there
at
their
last
moment.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes,
it
was
there
but
not
recognized
in
any
of
the
briefs
or
arguments
until
we
got
here.
now
then
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes,
that
is
the
surprising
part
of
it
and
i
draw
some
significance
from
the
fact.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
so,
there
are
here
of
course,
substantive
issues
and
procedural
issues.
now,
the
substantive
issues
i
think
i
have
made
entirely
plain
here,
well,
my
undertaking
to
put
them
into
sentence
or
two
and
the
procedural
issues
are
these.
i
think
we
made
a
case.
well,
it
was
the
preeminent
duty
of
the
federal
court
to
protect
us.
this
was
preeminently
a
federal
case.
they
--
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
supremacy
clause
was
merely
invoked
to
protect
some
private
rights
which
had
no
federal
origin
or
creation.
judge
bicks
bases
himself
on
the
well-known
pullman
decision
but
in
all
the
cases
that
he
cites
and
i
say
this
without
fear
of
contradiction,
foreign
commerce
was
in
no
way
involved.
the
rights
that
were
involved
were
private
rights
rising
under
common
law
and
the
claim
was
that
those
rights
were
being
invaded
by
a
state
court
action
in
such
ways
as
to
constitute
a
violation
of
due
process.
well,
that's
a
different
situation
because
they
are
at
least
--
there
was
duality
of
jurisdiction
and
there
were
certainly
no
exclusive
jurisdiction
involved
in
the
federal
government
nor
was
the
question
of
preemption
involved
in
the
slightest
way.
it
was
a
pure
case
of
discretion.
now,
so
i
say
there
was
a
fundamental
error.
now,
at
the
start
here,
a
misconception,
an
overlooking
that
we
were
in
an
area
of
foreign
commerce
and
that
what
this
court
was
doing,
the
district
court
was
in
effect
saying,
?nevertheless,
the
state
of
new
york
could
cross
this
highway
of
foreign
commerce
built,
controlled
and
operated
by
the
federal
government,
the
state
could
erect
a
sort
of
east
berlin
wall.
in
other
words,
veto
it.
i
emphasize
this
wasn't
a
case
of
conflict
between
mere
times.
this
was
a
case
where
the
attorney
general
was
saying
we
veto
what
the
federal
government
had
authorized
and
that's
the
reason
why
judge
cashin
said,
?this
is
the
heart
of
the
case.?
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
i
would
ask
of
this
court
to
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes
sir.
i
would
ask
of
this
court
that
the
court
direct
judge
bicks,
and
if
necessary
the
other
two
judges
so
as
to
round
out
the
mandamus,
to
accept
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
and
do
one
of
two
things,
either
convene
a
state
court
--
a
three-judge
court
and
grant
a
protection
to
us
on
a
restraining
order
pending
the
convening
or
else,
and
i've
been
studying
the
daily
case
of
two
days
ago
by
this
court,
recognized
that
there
can
be
no
debate
about
the
exclusiveness
of
jurisdiction
in
the
national
government
for
national
purposes
over
a
foreign
commerce,
and
that
consequently
this
referring
it
to
the
state
court
for
some
interpretation
or
finding
out
some
policy
about
the
alcohol
beverage
control
law
was
referring
the
whole
matter
to
a
sovereignty
which
had
no
jurisdiction
and
consequently
its
courts
would
have
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
i'm
asking
a
certiorari
to
the
court.
now,
my
friend
in
his
brief
has
described
what
has
happened
below
as
a
morass
of
complexities.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
i
am
suggest
--
i
was
coming
here
in
the
thought
that
there
must
be
a
three-judge
court,
but
after
i
got
here
i
read
the
opinion
in
the
bailey
case
and
i
saw,
at
least
i
thought
i
saw
it,
that
the
exclusiveness,
the
complete
supremacy
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
over
foreign
commerce
was
so
undebatable,
unlitigable
that
the
district
court
in
ought
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
thing
under
1337
itself,
but
i'll
have
to
leave
that
to
this
court.
you
asked
me
what
i
was
looking
for,
i
propose
two
outs
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
--
either
one
is
satisfactory
to
me.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it'd
be
little
presumptuous
for
me
to
undertake,
to
interpret
and
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
the
duty
of
a
one
judge
would
be
to
protect
us
against
the
assaults
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
liquor
authority
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
normally
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
normally,
i
would
with
the
reservation
however,
that
is
of
this
court
feels
as
i
feel
that
there
is
no
debate
about
the
sole
authority
of
the
federal
government
and
this
court
has
held
that
time
and
time
again
that
the
doctrine
of
the
bailey
case
is
applicable.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
i
will
--
i
will
go
directly
to
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
and
i
--
may
i
approach
it
in
the
way
of
discussing
two
surprises
that
i
find
and
they
are
related
together
and
i
think
i
--
the
second
one
which
is
the
twenty-first
amendment
must
be
considered
along
with
the
first
one.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
i
do
reject.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
no,
it
isn't
that
i
don't
like
the
reference
of
the
state
court.
the
ground
is
that
if
this
court
should
do
that,
this
court
would
be
recognizing
a
duality
of
jurisdiction
which
doesn't
exist.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
the
premises
of
that
would
have
cause
be
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
can
have
at
least
some
debatable
application
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
--
i
will
address
myself
to
that.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
oh
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
i
got
them
in
my
brief
in
reply.
i
immediately
rushed
to
see
what
this
court
have
said
about
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
relation
to
foreign
commerce.
now,
that's
a
different
proposition
in
relation
to
foreign
commerce.
i
know
what
some
of
the
decisions
have
been
with
reference
to
interstate
commerce,
but
i'm
now
talking
about
foreign
commerce.
may
i
approach
this,
this
way?
in
the
first
place,
your
honors
will
find
on
the
brief
of
my
friend
this
proposal,
page
8,
38
and
40.
i
think
that
the
force,
perhaps
i
am
over
complementing
my
brief,
but
i
think
the
force
of
what
we
had
put
together
here
impressed
to
the
attorney
general
and
that
they
felt
they
have
to
have
an
out
somehow
or
rather
and
you'll
find
it
as
expressed
as
an
alternative
for
this
court
and
says,
here's
a
practical
solution
to
rescue
the
case
from
a
morass
of
procedural
and
jurisdictional
complexity.
now,
that
practical
solution
is
this
and
i
read
it
verbatim,
it's
on
page
9.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
their
brief,
yes
sir,
page
9.
it
is
suggested
that
this
court
enter
an
order
as
follows
grant
the
petitioner
for
mandamus,
now
that's
what
they've
been
fighting
us
out
up
to
the
present
moment.
second,
remand
the
case
to
the
single
judge
district
court
with
instructions
to
cause
the
convening
of
a
statutory
three-judge
district
court.
that's
what
they
thought
a
step
by
step
in
all
the
lower
courts.
next,
direct
the
statutory
court
which
of
course
doesn't
exist
yet,
to
retain
jurisdiction
but
stay
further
proceedings
pending
the
disposition
of
the
related
question
of
state
law
by
the
state
courts
thereby,
asking
this
court
in
advance
to
decide
against
us
an
appeal
which
if
the
statutory
court
had
--
have
stayed
in
favor
of
the
state
court,
we
would've
take
it
to
this
court.
so
here,
we
have
a
direction
to
a
court
that
doesn't
exist
to
decide
a
contention
against
us
before
we
even
have
a
chance
to
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
in
the
first
place,
it
involves
us
in
an
extended
litigation
all
the
way
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
state
of
new
york
with
all
of
the
expense
and
the
delays
and
furthermore
there
is
a
provision
in
the
alcohol
beverage
control
law
quoted
in
my
brief
that
no
stay
can
be
granted
in
any
action
with
reference
to
that
statute
for
more
than
30
days.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
that
the
federal
court
could
stay
its
hand
but
how
could
it
stay
if
the
state
court
action
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
--
with
the
limit
of
30
days?
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes,
i
think
it
could
do
that
but
i'm
pointing
out
that
any
assumption
that
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
state
statute
itself
in
collisions.
now
then,
what
strikes
me
as
a
fundamental
in
this
proposal
is
that
it's
asking
this
court
to
make
an
order
which
it
has
never
made
before
in
connection
with
foreign
commerce
to
recognize
a
duality
of
jurisdiction,
and
if
you
do
that,
you're
overruling
a
lot
of
decisions
which
are
on
my
brief.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
if
i
may
just
conclude
this
matter
with
(inaudible)
sentences,
i'll
come
directly
to
the
twenty-first
amendment.
i
would
ask
your
honors'
attention
to
the
reasons
which
they
assign
for
these
new
proposals.
at
page
38
of
our
brief,
it's
in
one
sentence
and
i'll
read
it.
the
petitioner
seeking
a
threatened
infringement
of
its
rights
under
the
federal
constitutions
may
have
a
cause
of
action
which
it
cannot
seek
in
the
federal
court.
it
should
not
be
foreclosed
for
bringing
such
suit
nor
should
it
be
subjected
to
irreparable
harm
pending
the
judicial
determination
of
those
rights.
and
then
it
proceeds
to
--
at
page
31
to
offer
and
what
it
calls
an
assurance
that
if
the
case
in
the
federal
court
is
suspended,
pending
to
file
determination
in
a
state
court
action
to
be
brought,
they
will
agree
that
there
will
be
no
enforcement
proceedings
in
the
meanwhile
and
or
any
penalties
for
business
in
the
meanwhile.
of
course,
it's
inconceivable
that
even
where
they
have
assurance
of
that
third
parties
like
those
who
are
the
trackers
and
so
forth
are
going
to
be
very
much
impressed
with
that
protection.
they
are
not
parties
to
this
case.
and
in
also,
it
puts
our
entire
business
onto
a
shadow.
i'm
stating
that
because
they
cite
the
harrison
case
in
360
u.s.
167
where
abstention
was
granted
in
an
opinion
which
stressed
the
fact
that
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
there
had
been
assurances
by
the
state
officials
that
there
would
be
no
enforcement
proceedings
pending
final
determination.
well,
the
answer
to
that
is,
in
the
first
place
that
that
assurance
had
been
given
at
the
very
outset
of
the
federal
court
suit.
they
came
by
to
him
and
said
but
in
this
case
of
course,
we
met
nothing
but
threats
and
effort
suit
proceedings,
subpoenas
save,
representatives
consulting,
going
to
interstate
bonded
trackers,
going
to
us
and
telling
us
that
there
would
be
criminal
and
civil
proceedings.
and
in
the
second
place,
in
the
harrison
case
as
it
all
the
cases
they
say
that
foreign
commerce
isn't
involved
at
all
with
all
the
consequences
in
law
and
to
the
--
make
them
so
on
nationalism
which
is
essential
here
are.
our
justice
sentenced
from
the
--
this
court.
i
am
quoting
from
289
u.s.
board
of
trustees,
“the
principle
of
duality
in
our
system
does
not
attach
the
authority
of
the
congress
in
the
regulation
of
foreign
commerce
the
right
to
engage
in
foreign
commerce
is
not
the
gift
to
a
state
and
the
state
cannot
regulate
or
restrain.”
now
of
that
being
so,
i
am
also
saying
that
the
harrison
case
has
no
parallel
to
this
case
or
to
these
proposals
because
as
i
come
to
the
twenty-first
amendment,
i
will
refer
you
to
two
state
court
decisions
in
new
york
each
by
our
appellant
division
which
is
the
intermediate
appellate
court
holding
squarely
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
does
not
give
any
dual
jurisdiction
or
any
much
less
any
veto
power
over
foreign
commerce
in
wines
and
liquors
conducted
as
it's
conducted
here.
now
then,
i
come
to
the
twenty-first
amendment.
and
i'm
going
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
extraordinary
statement
that
they
make
and
have
to
make
in
order
to
give
that
amendment
any
possibility
of
application
here.
you
will
find
it
on
page
18
of
their
brief,
it's
in
a
heading
and
in
black
type
and
i'll
read
it.
“regulation
of
the
liquor
traffic
in
the
state
--
by
the
state
is
paramount,”
notice
this
word
paramount
“to
the
federal
governments'
right
to
regulate”
and
all
we
are
talking
about
is
foreign
commerce
here,
“whether
under
the
constitutional
provisions
governing
commerce,
exports
and
imports
and
supremacy
or
under
statutory
and
regulatory
provisions
of
a
preemptive
character.”
i
regard
that
as
the
extremely
revolutionary
statement
the
like
of
which
will
be
found
in
no
decision
by
this
or
any
other
court.
“paramount”,
it's
a
complete
denial
of
the
national
power
as
regards
foreign
commerce
in
wines
and
liquors.
it
would
make
impossible
the
plan
which
is
contained
in
311,
any
state
on
the
seaboard
or
on
the
pacific
coast
or
indeed
in
the
interior
could
veto
that
plan
in
cause
it
to
fall
as
utterly
ineffective.
now,
let
me
refer
in
the
discussion
back
to
the
concessions
made
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
opinion.
we
all
know
that
the
wording
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
this,
“the
transportation
or
importa
--
importation
into
any
state
territory
or
possession
of
the
united
states
for
delivery
or
use
therein
of
the
intoxicating
liquors
in
violation
of
the
laws
thereof
is
hereby
prohibited.”
now
i
read
you,
but
may
i
just
repeat
these
three
concessions.
delivery
is
not
made
within
the
state
because
it
isn't.
there's
no
delivery
to
anybody
except
to
cause
delivery
to
the
place
or
to
the
plane
but
that
plane
is
an
interstate
--
is
upon
plane
--
upon
commerce
plane
and
there's
no
delivery
to
the
passenger
until
he's
reached
abroad.
the
original
package
is
not
destroyed.
second
concession
was
it's
not
a
sale
or
consumption
in
the
state
and
of
course,
that
means
within
the
state.
and
the
third
one
is
that
this
is
an
export
within
the
meaning
of
section
311.
now
says
my
friend,
that
not
withstanding
all
that,
that
statute
311
does
mean
a
thing
when
it
comes
to
wines
and
liquors
is
completely
at
the
mercy
of
the
state
either
to
impose
a
license
or
to
impose
a
tax
or
to
veto
it
altogether.
and
it's
that,
that
is
claimed
in
this
case,
complete
disruption.
and
of
course
it
--
that
claim
about
the
twenty-first
amendment
now
brought
forward
completely
contradicts
the
whole
doctrine
that
the
other
side
of
contended
before
up
to
this
moment
that
they
shouldn't
be
abstention
by
the
federal
court
because
could
there'd
be
anymore
of
a
federal
question,
a
preeminent
federal
question
than
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
if
there
was
anything
in
the
world
that
made
this
a
federal
case
which
should
not
have
been
bound
out
to
the
state
courts
for
determination
in
some
state
action
not
then
existing,
it
would
be
the
question
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
so
they
contradict
their
whole
line
by
bringing
this
into
the
picture
and
i'm
saying
that
if
there
is
any
question
about
the
twenty-first
amendment
then
the
relief
i
ask
for
should
be
granted.
we
should
be
put
right
back
in
the
state
court
as
of
the
preeminent
court
by
statute
and
the
right
of
the
case.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
the
federal
court,
excuse
me
--
federal
court
for
determination.
now
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
i
can
appreciate
the
force
of
that
your
honor
but
the
statute
which
is
2281
until
4
under
which
we
have
asked
for
the
--
to
three-judge
court
and
the
federal
statute
1327
gives
us
the
right
of
protection
where
the
issue
arises
under
acts
of
congress
of
which
where
we
are
situated,
a
right
of
protection
against
officers
of
the
state
claiming
to
act
under
a
constitution.
now,
if
the
--
if
the
state
has
no
jurisdiction
at
all
in
this
field,
there
is
nothing
to
refer
to
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
now,
the
pullman
case
is
the
progenitive
of
a
line
of
federal
cases
on
which
abstention
has
been
based
from
time-to-time.
i
deal
with
that
in
the
brief
because
i
show
that
in
every
case
including
the
pullman
case
which
my
friend
cites
in
his
brief,
there
were
outstanding
grounds
for
the
inapplicability
of
the
doctrine
of
those
cases
here.
in
the
first
place,
there
was
no
foreign
commerce
involved
in
anyone
of
it.
in
the
second
place,
there
was
no
affirmative
right
in
anyone
of
them
created
by
the
federal
government
in
the
exercise
of
its
constitutional
power.
certainly,
no
paramount
right
created.
there
were
cases
where
the
federal
constitution
was
invoked
solely
for
the
protection
of
private
right.
let
me
give
you
one
of
the
illustrations.
under
a
state
court
--
under
a
state
statute
of
pennsylvania,
there
was
a
condemnation
proceeding
against
the
plaintiff's
property.
the
issue
was
whether
the
state
statute
made
adequate
provision
for
proper
compensation.
the
owners
of
the
property
rushed
in
to
the
federal
court
and
said
the
sup
--
due
process
clause
gathers
supremacy
from
this
nature
as
one
of
the
provisions
in
the
constitution
and
because
of
the
supremacy
clause.
and
this
court
said
that
there
was
a
question
which
might
remove
the
constitutional
question.
there
was
no
action
of
a
hostile
character
being
taken
like
sending
the
police
surrounded
to,
solving
injunction
of
criminal
proceedings
as
i
gave.
the
--
this
court
said
that
--
those
are
questions
is
to
whether
that
statute
did
or
did
not
provide
adequate
cause
and
compensation.
and
therefore,
there
could
be
an
abstention
to
find
out
what
they
are
--
there
was
plainly
a
duality
of
jurisdiction.
plainly
and
above
all
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
not
involved
in
any
sense
of
the
claim.
now,
all
these
cases
and
all
those
cited
by
judge
beeks
including
the
pullman
case
fall
within
that
area.
now,
they
have
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
i
have
started
to
go
--
i've
got
to
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes,
surely.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
interstate.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
see,
it
cannot
do
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
court
under
the
decisions
of
the
new
york
court
in
foreign
commerce.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
let
me
give
you
the
citations.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes,
this
court.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
two
of
them.
you
will
find
them
in
my
reply
brief
at
page
9.
now,
those
--
those
were
foreign
commerce
in
this
sense
that
they
involve
one,
the
yosemite
national
park
which
is
conclusively
under
--
so
this
court
held
for
these
papers
under
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
it
is
a
foreign
area.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes,
it
does.
it
talked
about
importation
into
any
state.
now,
i
was
going
to
say
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
what
a
sale
is
to
regulate
--
oh,
where
do
i
get
--
the
transportation
or
importation
into
any
state.
now,
that's
the
predicate.
now,
i
was
about
to
say
that
that
is
what
happens
here
at
all.
the
attorney
general's
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
no,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
i
don't
believe.
i'll
put
it
this
way
that
where
foreign
commerce
is
involved,
there
can
be
no
abstention
in
favor
of
the
courts
of
a
sovereignty
that
has
no
jurisdiction.
and
so
far
as
interstate
commerce
is
concerned,
there
have
been
cases
where
there
had
been
abstention
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
the
state
statute
means.
but
i
don't
know
of
any
decision
that
even
as
to
interstate
commerce
that
where
there
is
no
delivery,
and
the
attorney
general
has
conceded
it,
there's
no
delivery
within
the
state
and
where
there's
no
use
within
the
state
that
there
can
be
any
abstention
because
i
don't
see
anything
to
abstain
in
favor
of.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
oh,
it
--
it
have
--
well,
if
we
don't
get
it
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
we
don't
get
it,
it
comes
through
the
bureau
of
customs
into
the
bureau
of
customs
warehouse
in
our
least
supremacies
under
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
the
record
doesn't
show
here
except
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
certainly.
the
record
doesn't
show
anything
except
that
the
bonded
warehouse
in
question
was
maryland.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
no,
state
maryland.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
was
in
maryland.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
it
came
under
the
control
guidance
and
direction
of
the
u.s.
bureau
of
customs
on
abandoned
tracker
who
was
responsible
into
the
bureau
of
customs.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
may
i
--
may
i
--
to
come
right
to
it.
may
i
refer
your
honors
to
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
i
know.
i
understand
that.
but
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
--
i'm
saying
that
the
two
decisions
--
i'm
saying
that
the
two
decisions
of
this
court
cited
on
my
reply
brief
at
page
9,
answer
of
the
question
that
where
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
no,
no
my
reply
brief,
page
9.
now,
it
so
happens
providentially
that
four
days
ago,
they
came
out
in
a
--
the
last
northwestern
advance
sheets
of
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
--
which
i
put
in
an
addendum
and
i
trust
your
honors
all
have
this
addendum
because
l
ask
the
clerk
to
see
that
they
were
distributed.
it
covers
both
points
in
my
argument.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
it's
addendum
to
briefs
of
petitioner.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
i
file
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
no.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
no.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
it's
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
--
it's
an
addendum
to
briefs
of
petitioner,
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
filed
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
if
you
have
gotten
it,
i'd
like
to
see
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
--
it
gets
supply.
now,
that
is
deceits
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
holds
that
the
--
number
one,
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
no
taxing
power
over
liquor
that
is
being
imported.
it's
going
the
other
way
as
long
as
the
original
package
in
wisconsin
hasn't
been
broken.
and
in
second
place,
it
holds
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
it
all
application
until
the
bringing
of
that
liquor
into
wisconsin
and
cites
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
should
regard
as
controlling
on
that
thing.
