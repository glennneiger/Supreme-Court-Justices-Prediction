(inaudible)
alternative
--
reject
rather
the
alternative
suggestive
of
the
state's
brief
namely
that
we
grant
the
writ
and
direct
the
constitutional
three-judge
court
stay
any
further
state
proceedings
pending
reference
to
the
state
courts
of
the
question
interpretation
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
objection
i
gather
is
you
don't
like
the
reference
from
the
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
this
much
is
so
though
isn't
it
mr.
tuttle.
no
--
there's
no
decision
yet
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
from
this
court
which
you
can
rely
on
us
foreclosing
that
question,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
no,
would
stay
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wouldn't
it
stay
with
the
application
of
any
of
the
new
york
liquor
laws
against
your
client
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
tuttle,
i
suppose
the
state
might
answer
you
an
interpretation
of
the
state
statutes
as
not
applicable
to
your
business,
makes
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
or
the
meaning
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
--
i'm
just
addressing
myself
to
your
argument
based
in
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
think
you
yourself
said
earlier
that
you
made
reference
to
one
or
two
cases
at
least
pullman
and
sabre
which
is
frivolous
that
a
proper
reason
for
abstention
is
that
a
state
law
might
be
so
constitute
as
to
avoid
the
necessity
to
determine
a
federal
constitutional
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
that
question
involved
neither
the
two
appellant
division
cases
that
mr.
tuttle
mentioned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
question
as
a
construction
of
the
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
imply
as
confident
as
you
are
or
the
attorney
general
is
in
his
interpretation?
new
york
courts
may
not
agree
with
it
as
applied
for
this
particular
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
would
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
would
that
include
the
--
mr.
tuttle
makes
the
point
that
may
be
alright
for
him
but
what
about
the
tracking
companies
that
delivered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
--
with
the
issue
sale
or
not
under
the
definition
is
something
that
under
your
practice
would
first
have
to
go
through
administrative
proceeding
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
before
it
gone
in
to
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
goes
directly
to
the
declaratory
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
brought
in
your
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
a
question,
the
remand
in
those
cases
where
they
in
turn
to
remand
to
quote
single
judge
district
court
or
just
remand
to
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
may
have.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
ziffrin
actually
involved
in
the
foreign
commerce?
what
were
the
facts?
did
it
actually
involve?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'll
look
out
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
except
for
that
possibility,
what
is
the
reason
would
it
be
for
an
abstention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
reason
for
state
court
action
except
there
may
be
a
question
whether
in
fact
sale
means
as
used
(inaudible)
does
under
your
statute.
what
done
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
avoid
the
constitutional
question
unless
the
state
--
your
state
court
do
disagree
with
attorney
general
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
with
the
meaning
of
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
is
in
that
truck,
if
it's
going
from
maryland
across
the
state
of
the
new
jersey
and
new
york
and
the
same
truck
in
new
jersey
can't
tax
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
wasting
more
time
on
that.
you've
done
that
severally.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
how
about
the
possible
problem
comes
through
the
state
courts,
may
they
come
here
directly
or
do
they
have
to
get
back
from
abstaining
federal
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
do
it
but
that's
not
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
thank
you
very
much,
gentlemen.
