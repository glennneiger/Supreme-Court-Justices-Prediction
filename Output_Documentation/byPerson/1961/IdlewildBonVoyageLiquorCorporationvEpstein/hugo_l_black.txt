justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
say
this
court
has
held
it
time
and
time
again,
i'm
interested
in
the
question
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
you
before,
had
it
held
it
that
a
question
of
twenty-first
amendment
was
raised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
very
essentially
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
sackman,
would
you
oppose
to
stay
in
your
determination
on
these
issues
which
should
claim
in
the
case
rather
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
give
the
rule
that
did
apply,
same
rule
that
applied
to
foreign
as
to
interstate
commerce?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
said,
i
have
forgotten,
but
i
thought
you
said
(inaudible)
in
foreign
ex
--
exports
apply?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
meant
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
for
abstention
on
the
theory
that
you
will
ask
your
state
court
to
hold
that
this
--
these
activities
are
not
covered
by
the
act
--
by
the
state
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
why
--
why
are
you
in
favor
of
abstention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
you
agreed
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
that
they
are
covered
by
the
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
understand.
he
can
take
--
concede
it's
illegal
and
i
understand,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
if
he
is
insisting
that
it
is
protected
by
the
commerce
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
ought
to
send
it
back
to
the
state
you
--
in
order
to
get
them
to
hold
that
the
activities
are
the
kind
that
he
says
they
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
yet
they
are
covered
by
the
act
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
agreeing
with
him
as
to
what
those
activities
are
as
any
disagreement
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
factually,
you
have
no
dispute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
is
the
matter
(inaudible)
in
going
back
to
the
supreme
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
unless
we're
going
to
assume
that
they
will
hold
different
to
your
argument
and
different
to
his
argument
that
these
activities
are
not
in
--
does
not
part
by
the
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
avoid
it
unless
the
state
--
you
loose
your
case
before
the
state
court
and
mr.
tuttle
wins
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
rather
--
a
pretty
claim
uses
the
doctrine
of
abstention,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
hasn't
been
said
that
we
always
have
fame.
justice
hugo
l.
black
come
from
both
arguments,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
any
circumstances?
