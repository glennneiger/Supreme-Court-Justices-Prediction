am

right
in
my

mr.

that
its

the

decide
whether
not

do

justice
potter
stewart
i
think
your
honors
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
honors
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
honors,
there
are
many
questions
i
have
to
discuss
here.
i
have
--
i
believe
only
about
15
minutes
so
i'm
going
to
rely
on
my
brief
first.
that
on
the
assumption
that
your
honors
agree
with
me
that
the
single
judge
district
court
did
have
the
power
to
abstain
and
that
was
within
his
sound
discretion
to
do
so,
i
have
argued
in
my
brief
that
his
exercise
of
the
discretion
was
a
proper
exercise
in
the
discretion.
now
basic
to
this
determination
is
of
course
the
twenty-first
amendment.
and
i
should
like
to
spend
a
few
more
minutes
on
that.
the
twenty-first
amendment,
of
course,
is
a
federal
question.
we
have
never
said
that
it's
not
a
federal
question.
as
a
mater
of
fact,
it's
my
adversary
who
confuses
the
question
of
what
is
a
state
question
and
what
is
a
federal
question.
he
has,
if
one
reads
his
brief,
stated
that
the
determination
of
superior
regulatory
rights
of
the
state,
this
would
be
the
federal
government,
is
a
question
which
the
state
has
decided
against
--
against
us.
and
i
say
that
assuming
the
state
has
--
some
of
the
state
courts
have
done
so
and
i
can
only
see
one
case
that
does
so.
but
that's
not
binding
upon
this
court
because
this
is
essentially
a
federal
question.
in
state
board
of
equalization
against
young's
market
company,
this
court
held
that
under
section
2
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
the
states'
power
of
regulation
of
the
liquor
traffic
is
paramount
to
the
federal
government's
control
over
interstate
commerce.
and
your
honor
wished
to
know,
i
think
it
was
judge
frankfurter
who
wish
to
know
earlier
of
the
day,
as
to
whether
this
court
had
ever
made
a
decision
respecting
the
relative
supremacy
as
to
exports.
and
i
might
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
1939
decision
of
this
court
in
the
ziffrin
against
reeves,
where
the
appellant
had
argued
that
despite
the
twenty-first
amendment,
exports
remain
subject
to
the
commerce
clause
and
free
of
state
regulations.
this
court
affirmed
the
lower
court's
rejection
of
the
appellant's
argument
and
held
for
the
supremacy
of
the
state
rights
under
section
2
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
there
are
many
cases
which
follow
up
the
interstate
commerce
situation.
justice
potter
stewart
your
position
in
other
words
is
the
same
position
as
that
exemplified
in
the
attorney
general's
letter.
