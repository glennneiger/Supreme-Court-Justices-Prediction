justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
tuttle,
unless
i
did
not
hear
you,
you
have
made
no
reference
to
the
twenty-first
amendment,
is
that
not
in
your
case
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
surprising
--
i
like
your
--
surprisingly
it
is,
what
i
like
is
your
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
there
but
not
dealt
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
surprise,
isn't
it?
that's
the
surprising
part
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
was
a
(inaudible)
impression,
mr.
tuttle.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
tuttle,
it
would
help
me
if
you
would
interrupt
your
sequence,
your
architectural
order
and
tell
me
what
it
is
you
asked
of
this
court,
what
kind
of
a
judgment
do
you
want
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
argue
it.
i
just
want
to
know
sort
of
what
i'm
looking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
leave
me
a
little
in
doubt
whether
to
start
a
--
i'm
referring
from
what
you've
said?
you
started
with
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
reversed,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
want
--
do
you
want
--
are
you
suggesting
that
there
must
be
a
three-judge
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
say
in
putting
the
burden
on
this
court,
and
leaving
a
day
to
show
your
usual
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
ask
you
to
decide
for
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
did
seek
some
light,
i
did
seek
some
light
whether
you
think
that
this
presents
no
question,
no
ground
of
unconstitutionality,
therefore
there's
nothing
for
the
three-judges
to
decide
and
therefore
one
judge
should
go
ahead
and
do
what
--
whatever
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
any
event
you
are
asking
in
effect
an
injunction
against
state
authority
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
you
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
normally
that
would
require
on
the
ground
of
what
they're
doing,
has
no
constitutional
basis
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
therefore
normally
you
would
need
three
judges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
reason
why
you
will
answer,
as
you
only
said
promptly,
justice
black's
last
question
is
that
insofar
as
the
twenty-first
amendment
comes
in
to
operation,
it
may
come
into
operation
not
merely
the
reference
of
a
substantive
constitutional
issue,
but
if
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
got
that
it
may
bear
on
whether
or
not
an
appropriate
court
may
abstain
by
reference.
the
two
are
involved,
aren't
they?
if
there
is
something
to
the
twenty-first
amendment
problem
then
i
don't
think
that
they
will
stay
out
of
hand,
abstention
is
precluded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
tuttle
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you're
going
to
--
onto
another
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
you
--
well,
i
just
want
to
ask
you
this,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
the
--
the
twenty-first
amendment
permits
state
to
pass
enactments
which
control,
although
prior
to
the
twenty-first
amendment,
they
would
have
constituted
infringement
of
the
commerce
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
(inaudible)
starting
point
of
all
this
that
no
state
may
keep
out
liquors
taken
has
been
limited
by
the
twenty-first
amendment
as
to
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
i
want
to
put
to
you
is
whether
the
restrictions
upon
state
power
regarding
where
foreign
commerce
is
involved
is
greater,
a
state
can't
do
as
to
foreign
commerce
but
it
can
do
today
as
to
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
had
good
many
differences
among
ourselves
as
to
what
the
twenty-first
amendment
involved
with
reference
to
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
recall
you
correctly
or
before
me
--
i
do
not
recall
that
we
had
foreign
commerce
problems
under
that
amendment.
have
we
had
them,
mr.
tuttle?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
this
court,
not
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
case
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
talking
about
the
sale
import.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
it.
my
question
didn't
imply
that
i
disagreed
with
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
only
question
was
whether
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
there
may
not
be
the
need
for
ascertaining
underlying
state
law
or
state
practice
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
within
the
twenty-first
amendment.
i'm
not
in
indicating
that
i
think
it
is.
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
inside
or
outside.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there's
certainly
delivery
from
your
wholesale
as
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
am
i
wrong
that
new
york
wholesalers
put
into
that
bonded
house
liquor
within
the
state
of
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
get
the
liquor
from
somewhere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
called
maryland
or
the
name?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
did
it
get
to
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
light
of
the
decision
of
this
court
that
that
transportation
from
maryland
to
new
york
can't
be
shut
out
by
new
york.
i'm
not
at
all
sure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
i'm
in
favor
of
it.
justice

--
(voice

--
justice

in
december
29,
the
petitioners'
reply
brief
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
tuttle
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
a
brief
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
stand
or
fall
with
reference
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

all
tangled
up
with
a
lot
of
snarl
of
--
of
procedural
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
stand
or
fall
with
reference
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
altogether
whether
the
court
has
any
kind
of
jurisdiction?
fully
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
to
one
judge
or
three-judge
court?
i
think
there
is
--
that
the
complaint
presented
no
federal
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
what
you
conceive
to
be
--
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
federal
question
that
was
alleged
which
gave
the
district
court
jurisdiction
putting
to
one
side
for
the
moment
whether
a
three-judge
court
was
required
to
be
convenient.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
assume
that
--
that
as
a
matter
of
allegation,
he
stated
enough.
he
didn't
just
present
that
abstract
question.
does
the
district
court
have
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i'm
building
on
what
you
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
claim
seeking
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
state
laws
because
they
have
no
force?
in
that,
they
are
subordinates
to
--
to
federal
authority
with
the
constitutional
as
both
constitutional
and
statutory
which
gives
them
the
right
way
of
viewing
this
thing
without
later
interfering
by
state
officials
on
acting
under
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
--
that's
what
the
case
--
that's
their
complaint,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
they're
making
that
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
face
of
it,
you
couldn't
file
in
old
fashion
the
merit,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
not
--
whether
they
were
substantial,
whether
on
the
merits,
they
could
--
the
state
law
would
have
to
yield
or
can
bend
to
federal
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
here
agreeing
with
judge
beeks?
are
you
trying
to
sustain
his
original
judgment
namely
that
this
presented
a
problem
within
his
jurisdiction
but
in
view
of
the
entanglement
of
federal
and
state
law,
you
first
wanted
the
state
court
to
determine
what
the
state
law
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
involve
you
in
agreeing
that
he
could
do
all
that
by
himself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
state
question
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
do
you
think
is
a
--
a
condition
--
an
undeceiving
condition
to
determining
the
federal
issue
attended
by
mr.
tuttle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
get
the
piece
of
paper
which
entitled
them
to
get
a
bottle
labeled,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
attorney
general
passed
on
this
very
question
or
is
it
merely
was
there
a
--
or
did
he
merely
pass
on
whether
the
transactions
are
taxable
under
new
york
law
or
rather
two
--
or
is
there
an
equation
between
them?
there
--
if
there
is
a
sale
they're
taxable,
if
they're
not
taxable,
there's
no
sale.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on,
if
they
do
need
a
license
and
operate
without
a
license,
then
there's
an
illegality
with
certain
consequence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
still
would
leave
open
the
question
whether
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
such
a
restriction
invaliding
really
the
facts
which
is
foreign
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
into
that
mr.
sackman,
you
have
only
less
your
--
whatever,
it's
50
minutes
or
something
like
that,
for
me
this
case
raises
questions
have
put
the
argue
that
you
only
had
to
listen
to
oral
argument
for
hours
and
hours
and
hours.
now,
your
contend
to
--
you
are
just
here
sitting
pretty
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
appeal
and
brought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
so
far
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
so
far
as
the
court
--
as
far
as
the
judgment
that
is
before
us
leaves
you
in
a
position
of
getting
exactly
what
you
wanted,
the
reference
by
judge
beeks
that
a
single
judge
had
the
state
court
to
pass
on
or
whatever
to
pass
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
for
me
the
as
--
the
perfect
whole
basket
full
of
--
of
snails
in
this
case,
and
i
hope
before
you
sit
down
you'll
indicate
your
view
as
to
whether
judge
beeks
was
entitled,
assuming
he
has
the
power,
it
was
appropriate,
whether
he,
as
a
single
judge
could
fold
this
thing
in
up
stay,
whether
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
dismissing
this
appeal.
what
we
can
do
with
reference
to
the
thing
that
we
are
reviewing
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
certainly,
there
are
those
three
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
deal
with
before
we
ever
get
to
your
question
whether
anybody
should
abstain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what's
your
oral
argument
is
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
precisely
this
case,
poresky
was
a
case
in
which
a
statute
was
attacked
as
unconstitutional
which
had
already
been,
i
don't
know
in
how
many
instance,
held
constitutional.
and
the
court
held
what
we
held
in
the
different
situation
on
monday.
but
there
was
no
--
in
fact,
there
is
no
real
question.
but
you
don't
say
there's
no
real
question.
what
you
say
is
it
may
depend
on
what
the
state
law
ingredient
of
the
federal
question
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
you
don't
say
there's
no
federal
question.
you
say
there
is
a
statute
--
a
state
statutory
ingredient
and
that
if
--
that
would
be
authority
will
--
will
determine
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
because
it's
so
frivolous
or
so
depiction
as
we
said
in
bailey.
that
was
poresky
--
porensky
--
there
was
no
question
legally
speaking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
say
that
here
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
of
ordering
an
abstention.
it
doesn't
go
to
the
merits
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
nor
to
the
merit
of
the
question
where
the
three
judges
have
to
fold
their
hands
until
they
get
enlightenment
from
the
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
(voice
overlap)
went
into
the
--
united
states
district
court
claiming
that
his
right
for
being
blunt
to
threat
--
to
a
real
threat
of
state
officials
claiming
that
they
were
acting
under
state
law.
and
his
claim
is
that
those
state
laws
are
unconstitutional.
and
therefore
in
effect
--
i
have
--
i
suppose
in
terms
he
has
for
an
injunction
against
a
claim
authorization
by
state
statutes
which
made
statute.
he
said
to
fail
because
of
the
superior
federal
authority
and
that
the
district
court
neither
granted
the
injunction
nor
denied
the
injunction,
did
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
lifted
like
muhammad's
coffin
(inaudible)
as
in
a
mount
or
abattoirs.
and
therefore,
there's
a
serious
question
whether
a
single
judge
when
asked
to
grant
or
deny
the
injunction
which
normally
requires
three
judges
can
say,
“i'll
hold
the
matter
of
until
i
hear
from
the
state
court.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
judge
--
judge
beeks
had
dismissed
this
complaint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
unless
you
can
say
about
the
claim
of
right
protected
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
more
is
blunt
and
sought
to
be
frustrating
on
the
claim
that
there
are
some
state
legislation
which
can
blunt
such
a
claim.
and
the
claim
is
made
that
that
state
legislation
is
unconstitutional
then
3281
say
you
must
summon
three
judges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sackman,
i'm
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
the
lower
court,
single
judges
have
done
precisely
what
judge
beeks
said
as
a
division
in
the
lower
courts.
i'm
well
aware
in
the
fact
that
in
one
or
two
cases,
this
court,
without
considering
the
problem,
has
disposed
of
the
matter
without
any
reference
to
whether
a
single
judge
who
when
asked
to
enjoin
a
state
statute,
enforcement
of
a
state
statute
can
do
it
by
himself
or
as
to
someone
has
to
ask
the
senior
--
circuit
judge
to
convene
three
judges.
and
i'm
well
aware
of
that
fact.
this
case
is
here
partly
to
--
to
examine
and
face
those
problems
which
are
very
serious
jurisdiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
not
in
one
case
has
this
court
consider
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
this
court
ever
say
a
word
on
the
subject
in
many
of
those
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
this
court
ever
consider
the
question
that
i'm
putting
to
you?
now,
did
it
ever
spell
out
or
did
it
ever
discuss
it
in
hour
briefly
namely,
whether
a
single
judge
is
asked
to
enjoin
state
statute
and
he
neither
enjoins,
he
neither
grants
nor
deny
but
stays,
whether
he
can
do
that
all
by
himself.
has
this
court
ever
say
a
word
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
this
court
often
or
too
often
over
170
or
180
years,
not
too
often
but
often
necessity
makes
rulings
when
the
problem
isn't
(inaudible)
or
rightly
before
it
then
there
comes
a
time
when
you
have
to
consider
it.
and
this
is
one
of
those
times.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
says
he
--
if
when
he
denies
or
grants,
now
if
he's
asked
to
grant
and
he
doesn't
grant,
he
doesn't
explicitly
deny
but
he
at
least
for
a
period
denies
by
not
granting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
has
to
overcome
those
terms
of
that
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
put
the
problem.
you've
met
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but

that

you

doctrine

the

justice

except
that
he
has
to
determine
justifiably

presents

a
real
question.
and
that's
exactly
what
congress
meant
him
to
be.
congress

didn't
want
a

judge
to
decide
the
faith

state
legislation.
justice

he
shall,
the
statute
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
in

you
can
call
it
that.
congress
did
not
want
to
have
a
single
judge
decide
whether
he
should
declare
a
statute
unconstitutional
or
not.
and
it
didn't
propose
to
have
him
wait
at
the
end
in
order
to
find
out
where
this
going
to
knock
it
out
as
a
standing.
that's
the
whole
point
of
the
three-judge
mechanism.

you

it

it

court
of

that
the
tax
was
valid

invalid,
i
forgot
which.
and
they
had
no
power
to
do
that.
but
it's
a
very
different
thing
to
decide
just
as
this
court
when
it
holds
it
had
no
jurisdiction
as
we
did
in
bailey.
we
can
make
a
proper
disposition
for
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
too
modest
with
his
power
in
saying
it
couldn't
do
anything.
it
could
pass
on
--
it
had
jurisdiction
to
decide
what
the
district
court
judge
did,
and
then
it
could
have
jurisdiction
to
seek
the

court
did
and
in

that
the
district
judge
did
the
right
thing.
justice

i

it's
merely,
for

that
the

only
eight
judges

the

that
only

sit

may

you

get

even.
