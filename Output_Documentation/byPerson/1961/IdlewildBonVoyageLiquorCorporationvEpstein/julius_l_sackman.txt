mr.
julius
l.
sackman
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
the
petitioner
has
brought
this
action
for
a
judgment
declaring
that
certain
provisions
of
new
york's
alcoholic
beverage
control
law
sought
to
be
applied
to
it
are
unconstitutional
and
void
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
as
so
applied,
they
violate
the
commerce
clause,
the
export-import
clause
and
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
and
the
premises,
this
alleged
unconstitutionality
on
the
fact
that
the
state
seeks
to
regulate
in
an
area
where
by
reason
of
the
provisions
of
the
tariff
act
of
1930
as
amended
coupled
with
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
national
government
has
allegedly
preempted
regulation
by
the
states.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
predicated
solely
on
the
presence
of
the
alleged
federal
question.
there
is
no
diversity
of
citizenship
involved
nor
--
or
any
facts
alleged
upon
which
jurisdiction
may
be
based
other
than
the
fact
that
there
is
this
alleged
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution.
if
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right.
but
by
point
is
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
the
petitioner
of
(inaudible)
stand
or
fall
on
the
fact
that
he
presents
to
the
court
a
substantial
federal
question.
with
respect
to
the
first
part
of
the
proceeding
which
involved
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
with
reference
to
the
fact
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
with
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
has
presented
to
the
federal
court
a
substantial
federal
question
which
is
in
condition
to
be
considered
by
the
court
at
the
present
time.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
the
complaint
presented
a
potential
federal
question,
the
substantiality
of
which
presently
cannot
be
determined
on
the
posture
of
the
case
as
it's
presented
to
the
court
at
the
present
time.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
right.
the
question
of
whether
in
fact
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
new
york
were
enacted
or
were
being
sought
to
be
applied
at
the
present
time
in
a
manner
which
was
violative
of
alleged
paramount
federal
rights
respecting
interstate
commerce,
foreign
commerce
and
under
this
alleged
preemptive
scheme
under
the
tariff
act
and
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
assuming
that
the
--
you're
--
you're
keeping
out
of
the
case
now
the
question
of
state
law.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
assuming
that
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
yes,
sir.
assuming
that
the
federal
regulations
were
paramount,
assuming
that
the
federal
jurisdiction
was
paramount
then
there
would
be
no
question
about
the
substantiality.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
they
do
make
that
claim.
and
i
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no,
you
couldn't
because
as
the
--
as
judge
beeks
put
it,
he
couldn't
determine
at
either
way
because
of
--
as
he
put
it,
the
tentative
and
hypothetical
posture
in
which
the
case
was
presented
to
him,
that
pending
the
determination
of
a
necessary
aspect
of
the
case,
he
couldn't
tell
whether
the
question
--
the
federal
question
which
clearly
was
stated
was
in
fact
substantial.
that
is
the
point
which
judge
beeks
made
when
he
turned
them
down
in
their
application
for
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
agree
with
that
completely,
sir.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
yes,
sir.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
do
agree
with
that.
may
i
proceed?
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
in
all
instances?
i
don't
say
its
--
its
automatic
and
i
don't
say
it's
true
in
all
instances.
there
may
be
situations
where
the
questions
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
yes,
but
the
attorney
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
--
the
attorney
general,
nevertheless,
he's
still
merely
another
lawyer.
he
may
--
he's
--
his
opinion
may
have
a
little
greater
weight
perhaps
when
addressed
to
governmental
state
problems.
nevertheless,
it's
still
an
opinion
of
a
lawyer.
there
is
no
judicial
determination,
no
state
judicial
determination
of
the
question
which
was
before
the
attorney
general.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
and
that's
why
i'm
here
now
contending
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no,
no,
we
have
said
these
things.
we
have
said
--
we
have
said
that
this
is
a
sale
within
the
meaning
of
new
york
state
alcoholic
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
we
do
not,
sir.
we
do
not
make
the
federal
court
a
secondary
tribunal.
we
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
federal
question
ready
for
determination.
we
say
that
the
federal
question
is
not
yet
right
for
determination
that
the
application
is
pre-mature.
but
we
do
not
suggest
even
though
we
formally
moved
to
dismiss,
our
position
now
is
that
we
do
not
suggest
that
the
action
be
terminated
by
way
of
dismissal.
we
suggest
that
the
federal
court
retain
jurisdiction
and
abstain
pending
the
determination
of
the
state
question.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
what
will
happen
in
--
in
the
state
court
is
that
there
won't
even
have
to
be
a
trial
and
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
is
brought.
a
motion
will
be
made
purely
as
a
question
of
law.
there's
merely
a
question
of
law
involve
and
motion
will
be
made
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no,
no,
it
--
it
would
be
a
question
of
law
based
upon
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
we
will
accept
the
allegations
of
the
compliant
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
--
as
to
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
think
we
can
--
i
think
we
can
go
through
special
term,
the
appellant
division
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
six
months.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
the
state
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
at
the
demise
premises,
the
plaintiff
as
mr.
tuttle
has
rather
accurately
stated
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
sells
--
sells
bottles
of
liquor
is
an
actual
sales
transaction.
they
take
an
order,
they
take
the
payment
for
it,
they
give
a
receipt
for
it,
which
receipt
the
passenger
purchaser
uses,
i
suppose,
later
on
to
retrieve
the
bottle
at
the
point
of
this
embarkation
in
a
foreign
country.
but
there
is
an
actual
sale
which
takes
place
at
that
point.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right.
however,
unless
this
court
misconceived
the
thing,
we
do
not
conceive
of
the
sale
transaction
in
the
normal
sense
of
a
sale
in
which
the
question
delivery
is
involved
as
to
whether
it's
consummated
time
of
delivery
or
at
the
place
of
delivery.
we
have
a
specific
statute
which
defines
a
sale
under
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
law.
and
your
honors
will
find
in
the
appendix
to
the
states'
brief
or
the
liquor
authorities'
brief
rather
at
page
42,
sale
means
any
transfer,
exchange
or
barter
in
any
manner
and
by
any
means
whatsoever
for
a
consideration
and
includes
and
means
all
sales
made
by
any
person
whether
principle,
proprietor,
agent,
servant
or
employee
of
any
alcoholic
beverage
indoor
or
warehouse
receipt
pertaining
thereto
to
sell
includes
to
solicit
or
receive
an
order
for,
to
keep
or
expose
for
sale
and
to
keep
with
intent
to
sell
and
shall
include
the
delivery
of
any
alcoholic
beverage
in
the
state.‚Äù
now,
the
mere
fact
that
they
have
this
bottle
on
their
shelves
exposed
for
sale,
the
mere
fact
that
they
solicit
orders
under
our
statute
constitutes
a
sale.
and
so
therefore,
whether
we
treat
of
this
transaction
as
the
sale
in
the
traditional
commercial
sense
or
whether
we
treat
of
the
sale
as
defined
in
the
rather
limited
or
rather
broadened
in
which
is
defined
in
our
alcoholic
beverage
control
law,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york
may
very
well
go
along
with
the
attorney
general
in
his
opinion
that
the
transactions
which
were
involved
here
constituted
sales
within
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
those
cases
that
he
was
talking
about
dealt
with
the
relative
supremacy
or
paramountcy
of
rights
between
the
state
regulation
and
federal
regulation
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
point.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right
but
this
of
course,
i
--
l
merely
pointed
this
out
incidentally,
that
will
be
the
question
which
will
be
the
state
courts
and
which
is
within
the
peculiar
prerogative
of
the
state
courts
to
determine.
and
it's
the
determination
of
that
question
which
is
the
necessary
prerequisite
to
the
presentation
of
a
federal
question
to
the
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
make
no
such
implication.
i
agree
--
i
agree
that
there's
a
possibility
they
may
disagree
with
us.
but
i
--
i
rather
confidently
expect
that
they'll
go
along
with
us.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no,
i
didn't
go
into
that
at
all.
he
went
for
the
--
the
question
that
was
involved
here
was
imposed
directly
by
the
idlewild
bon
voyage
liquor
corporation
to
the
state
liquor
authority
which
was
referred
to
the
attorney
general
as
to
whether
a
description
was
given
of
the
business
which
was
transacted
and
the
question
was
do
they
need
a
license?
there's
no
question
of
taxes
or
whether
there
was
a
sale
or
no
sale.
the
question
was
do
they
have
to
be
licensed
under
our
alcoholic
beverage
control
law?i
should
like
to
correct
in
that
respect
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no
question
about
that,
sir.
and
i
should
like
to
at
this
point
to
correct
the
third
thing
which
was
contained
in
the
attorney
general's
opinion.
the
attorney
general
made
the
statement
that
this
petitioner
was
not
eligible
under
the
law,
under
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
law
to
a
license
that
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
law
made
no
provision
for
a
license
in
this
case.
and
i
think
your
honors
might
have
gotten
the
misimpression
from
mr.
tuttle's
argument
that
this
was
because
the
legislature
never
contemplated
that
they
will
going
to
interfere
with
interstate
commerce
to
foreign
commerce
and
that
was
not
the
point
at
all.
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
it
was
provided
that
licenses
shall
be
issued
to
stores
under
certain
physical
conditions
one
for
example,
that
the
store
be
at
street
level.
the
only
exception
to
that
was
that
in
a
railroad
terminal
where
there's
an
arcade
or
a
wreath
going
down
that
a
license
--
license
premises
could
be
located
there.
other
than
that,
they
could
be
no
license.
now,
the
petitioner's
premises
are
located
on
the
second
floor
in
one
of
the
buildings
of
the
idlewild
airport.
now
at
the
time
that
this
section
was
enacted,
of
course
we
didn't
have
the
airports
that
we
have
today.
we
didn't
have
the
commercial
activity
around
the
airports
or
the
transportation
of
passengers
that
we
have
today,
and
if
it
just
never
occur
to
make
an
exception
in
favor
of
the
issuance
of
licenses
to
somewhat
above
or
below
street
level
at
an
airport.
and
so
for
that
reason
only
did
the
attorney
general
say
that
the
law
provides
has
no
provision
for
the
issuance
of
a
license
to
a
petitioner
who
is
conducting
premises
of
this
character.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
true.
and
l
proposed
to
discuss
that
your
honor.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
of
course
not
--
of
course
not.
we
said
so
affirmatively
and
in
that
respect,
i
--
i
might
say
this,
that
it's
true
that
i
didn't
make
these
assurances
until
we
got
to
this
court
because
this
is
the
first
court
in
which
i
appear
for
--
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
if
others
appear
before
then
and
i
will
say
this.
this
policy
generally,
the
state
liquor
authority
being
an
enforcement
agency
in
this
field
is
not
be
stayed,
they
don't
want
to
be
stayed.
but
i
spoke
to
them
about
it
and
i
assured
them
that
we
ought
to
give
a
stay
in
this
case
and
all
fairness
we
ought
to
do
this.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
my
--
my
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
we
can
give
the
stay
just
as
broadly
as
they
wish
it.
we
will
desist
of
many
harassment
of
any
sort.
mr.
tuttle
has
sort
of
look
to
give
to
us
in
amount
here,
when
i
made
these
assurances,
i
made
it
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
doesn't
need
the
assurances.
he
can
get
unlimited
restraint
right
under
new
york
civil
practice
act.
the
point
that
he
makes
about
the
inadequacy
of
the
state
remedy
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
he
dislikes
going
into
the
state
courts
is
that
irreparable
injury
will
be
done
to
him
because
under
section
121
of
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
law,
a
stay
is
limited
to
30
days.
but
i
should
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
state
under
121
applies
only
to
actions
which
are
brought
under
121.
and
those
actions
are
to
review,
and
they
--
they
appear
on
page
31
and
32
of
my
brief,
to
review
certain
categories
of
determinations
made
by
the
state
liquor
authority
where
they
seek
to
review
such
and
there
usually
by
and
it
--
these
are
administrative
determinations
which
are
then
reviewed
and
delayed
by
proceedings
in
the
nature
of
certiorari.
under
those
circumstances,
section
121
limits
the
stay
to
30
days.
but
in
this
case,
the
type
of
action
which
the
petitioner
would
bring
in
the
state
supreme
court
is
an
action
not
to
review
the
action
of
the
state
liquor
authority
either
under
its
general
jurisdiction
or
within
the
specific
categories
which
are
made
under
section
121.
his
action
is
based
upon
an
assertion
that
the
authority
is
without
jurisdiction
at
all
over
him
by
virtue
of
the
impact
of
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no,
sir.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
he
could
bring
this
action
under
new
york
civil
practice
act
section
473
for
declaratory
judgment.
and
20
years
ago
in
1941,
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
and
new
york
operators
against
the
state
liquor
authority
in
--
an
action
involving
the
identical
situation
here
and
it's
against
the
state
liquor
authority
said
they
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
necessary
jural
relation
exist
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendants
for
such
an
action.
and
it
concluded
the
necessity
of
a
license
may
be
the
subject
of
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment.
well,
now
that's
the
very
point
that
would
be
involved
in
our
case.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
brought
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
since
it's
brought
under
the
civil
practice
act
provisions
is
under
this
action,
sections
877
and
879
of
our
civil
practice
act
would
apply.
and
i
should
like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
read
to
you
some
relevant
provisions
of
those
sections.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
in
the
sense
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
except
--
i
--
i
think
i
have
attempted
to
overcome
it
in
my
--
in
my
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
--
my
practical
suggestion
as
to
a
solution
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i've
shown
that
i'm
not
content
just
to
take
advantage
of
--
of
the
position
that
i
am
in.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
correct.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
right.
and
i
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
have
answered
every
one
of
those
questions.
we
is
discussed
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
--
everyone
of
those
points
and
i
should
like
to
get
to
it
if
i
may.
first
of
all
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
as
to
the
power
of
the
single
judge
district
court
to
order
abstention.
in
poresky,
this
court
held
that
a
single
judge
district
court
or
rather
let
me
put
it
this
way.
in
the
case
at
bar,
a
single
judge
district
court
has
refused
to
convene
a
statutory
court
on
the
ground
that
because
of
the
tentative
and
hypothetical
posture
of
the
case,
he
is
unable
to
find
that
there
exist,
the
substantial
federal
question
which
is
an
essential
prerequisite
to
the
convening
of
the
statutory
court.
now,
that
he
has
this
power
was
the
purport
of
this
court's
decision
in
poresky
where
the
court
held
that
the
provision
requiring
the
presence
of
a
court
of
three
judges
necessarily
assumes
that
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
but
that
the
determination
of
this
question
is
not
--
does
not
--
is
not
required
by
the
statute
to
be
passed
upon
by
the
three
judges.
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
district
court
clearly
has
authority
to
dismiss
for
the
want
of
jurisdiction
when
the
question
lacks
the
necessary
substance
and
no
other
ground
of
jurisdiction
appeal.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
true.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
but
i
say
that
there's
a
federal
question
which
lurks
in
the
background
which
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
--
may
materialize
or
may
not
materialize
and
for
that
reason
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
in
bailey
--
in
bailey,
you
said
that
a
three-judge
court
is
not
required
when
the
claim
for
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
wholly
insubstantial,
legally
speaking
on
existence
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no,
but
i
would
say
here
that
here
we
can't
tell
whether
it
is
or
is
not
insubstantial.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
say
that
the
single
judge
court
who
had
to
decide
the
preliminary
question
of
substantiality
before
he
had
the
right
to
request
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court
needed
enlightenment
from
the
state
courts
as
to
a
question
of
state
law,
the
court
--
before
he
could
determine
the
substantiality
of
the
federal
question.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
but
--
but
your
honor
this
court
has
held
time
and
again
in
cases
that
--
and
--
and
premised
on
the
--
on
the
determination
in
poresky
were
--
was
dismissed
on
those
grounds
that
the
greater
power
includes
the
lesser
power
and
then
if
has
the
right
to
dismiss
under
those
circumstances,
it
has
a
right
to
retain
jurisdiction
and
order
abstention
so
that
it
can
determine
later
on
when
the
determination
comes
in
from
the
state
court
whether
the
question
is
substantial
or
not.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
say
--
well,
some
courts
have
dismissed
on
abstention
grounds.
i
think
that
by
retaining
jurisdiction
and
abstaining,
he
was
doing
--
he
was
doing
the
right
thing.i
--
i
don't
believe
the
he
should've
dismissed
on
abstention
grounds.
although,
there
had
been
cases
where
federal
courts
have
dismissed
on
so
called
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
then
may
i
call
your
honors'
attention.
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
city
of
meridian
against
southern
bell
telegraph
and
telephone
company
in
1959,
the
--
a
declaratory
judgment
action
was
broached
to
declare
that
a
state
statute
didn't
apply
to
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
and
that
if
it
did
apply,
it
was
unconstitutional.
the
case
was
tried
before
a
single
judge
district
court
on
the
merits
and
the
statute
was
held
invalid.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
this
court
without
passing
on
demerits,
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
single
judge
district
court
with
the
directions
to
hold
the
cause
while
the
parties
were
paired
to
a
state
tribunal
for
an
authority
of
declaration
of
applicable
state
law.
and
the
interesting
thing
about
that
case
and
this
case
is
that
in
both
cases,
the
sole
predicate
for
federal
jurisdiction
is
the
alleged
federal
question.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well
then
i
should
like
to
--
to
continue
along
those
lines
your
honors
in
several
cases.
as
i
read
them,
they
seem
to
be
all
going
in
one
direction.
even
from
this
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well
now,
even
prior
to
meridian
and
subsequent
to
meridian,
the
--
the
problem
seems
to
have
been
before
the
court.
for
example
in
chicago
against
fieldcrest
dairies
back
in
1942,
a
suit
which
was
within
the
ambit
of
three
courts
--
three-judge
court
jurisdiction,
the
single
judge
district
court
determined
the
question
of
state
law
which
was
involved
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
the
same
thing.
this
court
vacated
the
judgment,
remanded
the
course
to
the
single
judge
district
court
with
directions
to
abstain.
and
spector
motor
service
against
mclaughlin
in
1944,
again
a
suit
which
fell
into
the
ambit
of
three-judge
court
jurisdiction,
the
single
judge
district
court
decided
the
case
on
the
merits
including
the
question
of
state
law.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court
but
its
decision
too
was
based
upon
a
consideration
of
the
merits.
this
court
vacated
the
determination
of
the
appellate
court,
remanded
the
case
to
the
single
judge
district
court
with
directions
to
abstain
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
it
said
with
directions
to
retain
the
bill
pending
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
if
this
--
it's
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
if
this
court
had
said
it
in
such
terms,
i
would
have
had
it
in
my
brief
your
honor.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
so
what
i'm
doing
is
to
pointing
out
what
the
court
--
well,
you
can't
find
what
the
court
says,
you
try
to
show
what
the
court
did
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
right.
well
now
then
may
i
call
your
attention
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no,
the
--
the
remand
was
to
the
district
court.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
but,
they
were
--
they
were
matters
which
emanated
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
--
from
a
single
judge
district
court.
and
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
i
was
out
of
line
when
i,
of
course,
emphasized
single
judge
because
it's
a
matter
like
they
came
from
a
single
judge
court.
i
can
see
that
the
--
the
--
in
terms
of
the
remand
was
to
the
district
court.
now
even
subsequent
to
the
meridian
case,
in
two
cases
which
i
will
concede
at
the
outset
were
not
within
the
ambit
of
the
three-judge
district
court
jurisdiction.
in
louisiana
power
light
company
against
the
city
of
thibodaux,
the
district
court,
a
single
judge
district
court
ordered
abstention
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
decision.
this
court
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
reinstated
the
abstention
order
of
this
court
--
of
the
district
court.
and
on
the
same
day
in
the
mashuda
case,
your
honors
will
recall
that
a
single
judge
district
court
had
dismissed
the
suit
on
principles
and
abstention.
it
was
a
dismissal
on
the
principles
of
abstention.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
lower
court
and
this
court
affirmed
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
but
it
was
by
a
split
decision.
the
majority
held
that
the
district
court
had
abused
its
discretion
in
dismissing
on
the
ground
of
abstention
and
the
minority
were
--
reviewed
that
the
district
court
had
acted
within
its
proper
discretion.
but
what
is
of
paramount
interest
in
this
case
is
that
neither
the
majority
nor
the
minority
question
the
right
of
the
district
court
to
exercise
its
discretion.
the
single
judge
district
court
to
exercise
its
discretion
in
this
respect,
they
merely
deferred
as
to
whether
he
had
properly
exercised
it
or
abused
it.
now
as
i
pointed
out
about
mashuda
and
thibodaux,
both
cases
in
which
were
not
within
ambit
of
three-judge
jurisdiction.
but
again
i
say
that
where
a
cases
within
the
conceded
jurisdiction
of
the
single
judge
district
court,
no
matter
what
the
basis
of
that
jurisdiction
may
be,
if
before
he
can
determine
the
question,
if
in
order
to
ripen
the
question,
even
--
if
in
order
to
mature
the
things
to
the
point
where
he
can
apply
the
federal
principles
which
are
involved,
he
has
the
power
as
supplemental
to
his
power
subsidiary
to
his
power
to
order
abstention.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
correct.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
i
--
i
think
were
--
were
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
--
if
i
may
judge
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
the
court
of
appeals
in
considering
this
matter,
even
though
they
dismissed
the
appeal,
did
conclude
that
the
right
to
abstain
in
the
first
instance
in
cases
which
come
within
the
ambit
of
three-judge
district
court
jurisdiction
was
for
the
three-judge
court
and
not
for
the
single
judge
court.
and
they
reasoned
that
the
decision
to
abstain
is
different
from
preliminary
contamination
of
substantiality
since
it's
not
automatically
said.
it
presupposes
jurisdiction
that
is
subsequently
surrendered.
now,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
unwarranted
weight
to
this
distinction.
i
think,
first,
that
a
decision
to
abstain
is
similar
in
many
ways
to
a
decision
on
the
question
of
substantiality
or
decision
on
the
question
of
equity.
and
that
these
matters
are
for
--
the
disposition
of
these
matters
is
mandatory,
not
discretionary,
when
the
facts
come
within
the
criteria
which
have
been
fixed
by
this
court.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
true.
but
i
--
but
i
should
--
but
i
--
but
i
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
but
my
--
my
point
is
here
your
honor
that
--
if
i
may
continue
with
the
reasons
why
it
is
not
in
the
first
instance
within
the
prerogative
of
the
three-judge
court,
a
decision
to
abstain,
just
like
a
decision
on
the
question
of
substantiality
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well
your
honor,
asking
a
question
purely
rhetorically,
i'm
not
expecting
an
answer
unless
your
honor
wishes
to
answer
it.
if
you
would
to
follow
out
that
reasoning
then
every
time
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
which,
at
least
on
its
face,
fell
within
the
ambit
of
three
court
jurisdiction.
actually,
the
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
--
the
convening
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
true.
then,
under
those
circumstances,
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court
would
become
a
purely
automatic
thing
calling
for
no
thinking
on
the
part
of
the
judge
before
--
the
single
judge
before
whom
it
appears
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
i
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
now
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
what
happens
is
that
the
--
the
single
judge
court
makes
the
request
of
the
chief
circuit
judge
to
convene
with
the
court.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
think
that
is
true
even
under
the
existing.
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
if
the
single
judge
district
court
decides
to
make
a
request
but
the
senior
circuit
court
judge
would
have
to
convene
the
--
the
statutory
court.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right.
i
think
he
has
to
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
--
but
my
--
my
point
is
--
was
this
that
on
the
--
if
we
follow
out
to
its
extreme,
the
suggestion
is
made
by
judge
frankfurter
and
i
know
he
is
making
the
suggestions
purely
for
the
purpose
of
eliciting
the
reasoning.
the
action
of
the
single
judge
district
court
makes
him
almost
an
automaton.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
yes,
sir.
as
i
read
the
case,
i
--
i--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
unless
i
have
misread
the
case
your
honor
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
don't
recall.
i
haven't
got
the
name
of
the
judge
who
rendered
the
decision
your
honor.
and
unless
i
have
misread
the
case,
it
applied
the
same
rule
that
was
applied
in
state
board
of
equalization
and
in
carter
against
virginia.
and
those
cases
applied
to
interstate
commerce,
i
believe
it
was
applied
to
exports.
now,
the
best
statement
i
think
or
i
should
say
--
shouldn't
say
the
best
statement
but
a
good
statement
of
the
relative
rights
was
given
by
a
federal
district
court
affirmed
by
the
fourth
circuit,
certiorari
later
being
denied
by
this
court.
in
united
states
against
rankin
where
the
court
said
that
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
it
is
entirely
up
to
the
state
where
the
liquor
can
be
imported
into
or
delivered
or
used
within
its
boarders.
since
it
can
prohibit,
it
may
permit
under
such
terms
as
it
sees
fit
untrammeled
by
the
due
process
clause,
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
the
only
one
i
--
i
found
was
the
ziffrin
case
to
which
i've
referred.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
ziffrin's
against
the
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well
right
now,
with
the
--
i
think
i
had
a
hundred
cases
to
this
case
and
i
--
when
--
they
begin
to
merge
with
each
other.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
in
california
against
washington,
which
your
honors
may
recall,
only
in
1958,
that
was
an
action
which
arose
under
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
where
the
state
of
california
sought
to
file
a
bill.
and
my
office
filed
a
brief
in
support
of
california's
position
as
amicus
curiae.
now,
we
contended
in
that
case
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
did
not
subordinate
federal
rights
arising
under
the
commerce
clause
to
state
regulation,
and
we
specifically
requested
this
court
to
overrule
its
decision
in
state
board
of
equalization
against
young's
market
company.
this
court
rejected
our
argument
and
denied
leave
to
file
the
bill.
so
now
were
on
the
other
side
and
we
kind
of
take
advantage
or
something
we
learned
in
the
california
case.
now,
i
should
like
to
continue
under
this
twenty-first
amendment
situation.
counsel
for
the
petitioner
says
that
this
is
a
state
question
and
he
says
in
rosenbloom
against
franklin
appellate
division
case
in
new
york
state,
the
--
the
views
which
he
expressed
as
to
relative
superiority
of
supremacy
were
decided
in
favor
of
the
federal
government.
now
assuming
that
is
so,
i
still
say
that
this
court
is
not
bound
by
a
state
court
determination
on
a
federal
question.
now,
the
other
cases
which
they
cite
may
be
distinguished
on
various
grounds.
for
example,
manner
of
gulf
oil
co.
against
mcgoldrick
which
was
in
an
appellate
division
decision
affirmed
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
later
affirmed
by
this
court.
the
court
disallowed
a
city
sales
tax
on
oil
which
was
held
in
bonded
warehouses
class
6.
and
might
i
parenthetically
amplify
on
the
definition
of
a
class
6
warehouse
about
which
mr.
justice

class

bonded
warehouses
don't
deal
only
with
wines
and
liquors.
all
merchandise
for
export
is
in
class
6
bonded
warehouses.
and
so
here,
you
had
oil
which
was
in
a
bonded
warehouse
class
6.
and
the
tax
was
stricken
down
on
the
ground
that
this
was
an
unconstitutional
interference
for
foreign
commerce,
but
this
case
dealt
with
oil,
not
liquor.
the
impact
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
wasn't
present.
in
addition
to
that,
it
may
be
distinguished
on
the
ground
that
it
dealt
with
the
tax
and
not
with
that
part
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
which
is
reserved
to
the
state
under
section
2
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
in
drory
against
valenti,
another
case
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner.
there
was
a
question
with
respect
to
liquor
stored
for
export
purposes
in
the
foreign
trade
zone
in
the
port
of
new
york.
now,
that
is
an
enclosed
police
area
which
was
created
under
federal
law
pursuant
to
state
statutory
authorization.
the
city
of
new
york
had
to
get
authorization
from
the
state
of
new
york
to
apply
to
the
federal
authorities
to
create
this
foreign
trade
zone
in
the
port
of
new
york.
and
the
state
statute
which
authorized
the
city
of
new
york
to
make
the
application
specifically
provided
that
if
it
would
be
granted,
the
city
was
to
operate
--
establish,
operate
and
maintain
such
zone
in
accordance
with
law
that
is
in
accordance
with
the
federal
law.
so
that
to
this
extent,
the
state
statute
may
be
construed
as
a
legislative
surrender
by
the
state
with
respect
to
the
foreign
trade
zone
area
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
--
of
its
paramount
rights
of
regulation
in
much
--
may
i
just
finish
this
sentence,
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
state
concededly
has
no
paramount
rights
of
regulation
over
lands
which
are
--
where
sovereignty
is
seated
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i'm
going
to
argue
that
this
--
in
the
--
i'm
going
to
argue
with
the
state
court
that
this
activities
are
illegal
under
the
state
law.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
because
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
if
--
if
counsel
where
to
concede
that
his
operations
were
illegal
under
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
--
the
state's
alcoholic
beverage
control
law
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
correct.
that's
his
contention.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no,
that
they're
not.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
say
they
are
not
--
they
are
not
protected
that
the
right
--
the
regulatory
rights
of
the
state
with
respect
to
a
licensing
transactions
of
liquor
are
superior
to
any
rights
that
the
petitioner
claims
under
the
federal
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
factually,
we
have
no
dispute
as
to
what
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
we
have
no
dispute
is
to
what
the
--
what
the
facts
are.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
correct.
we
say
that
exactly
what
we
said
in
the
attorney
--
in
the
opinion
which
was
issued.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
think
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
there
are
two
things
that
the
state
court
can
hold.
the
state
court
can
hold
one
that
this
--
that
this
didn't
constitute
a
sale.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that
these
transactions
do
not
constitute
a
sale
and
then
the
whole
case
is
down
the
drains
so
far
as
the
state
is
concern.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no.
no,
that's
not
our
argument.
but
they
could
find
that
and
then
there'd
be
no
federal
question
because
their
--
their
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
of
course,
we're
operating
on
the
--
on
the
point
that
if
there
is
abstention,
there
is
state
court
action,
there
will
be
a
fine
but
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
your
honor,
this
court
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
this
court
had
said,
and
i
think
your
honor
earlier
in
the
day,
referred
to
the
fact
that
this
court
will
avoid
unnecessary
friction.
the
general
basis
of
the
pullman
decision
and
the
cases
which
follow
will
avoid
on
committee
reasons
and
early
determination
and
unnecessary
determination
for
constitutional
question.
now,
that's
--
that's
based
on
the
fact
that,
of
course,
these
state
courts
might
decide
contrary
to
the
attorney
general's
view
as
to
whether
it's
a
sale.
now,
we,
of
course,
aren't
going
through
this
just
for
the
exercise.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right.
now,
we
--
we
expect
that
the
states
--
that
is
that
we
--
we
are
hoping
that
the
states
will
--
that
the
courts
will
agree
with
the
attorney
general's
opinion.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right.
and
there's
nothing
to
come
back
for.
now
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
true,
but
how
are
you
--
how
--
i
--
i'll
concede
that
i'm
saying
that
you
must
abstain
in
order
--
because
you
haven't
got
a
right
to
do
this
because
maybe
the
courts
will
hold
against
me.
and
therefore,
you'll
never
have
to
answer
the
question,
and
then
there's
something
anomalous
about
it.
but
nevertheless,
from
your
point
of
view,
where
the
impartial
point
of
view
where
you
don't
--
where
you
don't
hold
anything
either
way
as
to
how
the
state
court
is
going
to
decide
it.
you
cannot
reach
the
question
which
is
for
your
determination
until
you've
gotten
the
determination
no
matter
how
it
goes.
now,
it
may
be
peculiar
that
this
argument
comes
from
my
mouth
rather
than
from
my
adversaries
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
my
adversary
doesn't
want
abstention
under
any
circumstances.
he
doesn't
want
abstention
under
any
circumstances.
he
says
that
so
long
that
it's
an
interstate
commerce,
foreign
commerce,
that's
what
distinguishes
all
of
the
cases
from
this.
and
what
he's
forgotten
about
is
that
the
cases
which
he
cites
on
these
things
don't
deal
with
the
police
power.
they
deal
--
we
can
see
for
example
that
the
state
cannot
tax
merchandise
which
is
an
interstate
commerce
even
if
its
wines
or
liquors.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that
even
if
its
wines
and
liquors,
the
state
cannot
tax.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
but
that
is
we
cannot
tax
if
it's
an
interstate
commerce.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
yes,
because
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
the
tax
--
you're
talking
about
the
merchandise.
now,
the
wines
and
the
liquors
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right.
i
say
you
cannot
tax.
the
twenty-first
amendment
section
2
did
not
reserve
to
the
states
any
taxing
power
or
any
of
its
general
police
powers
other
than
that
part
of
its
police
power
which
dealt
with
the
regulation
of
transactions
in
liquor.
the
police
power
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
we
can
keep
it
out.
yes.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
right.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
now
there,
your
honor,
i
must
disagree
even
though
it
might
be
contrary
to
the
position
hence
that
i
ought
to
take.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
i
--
i
--
i
have
read
the
decisions.
for
example,
i
--
i
might
say
this,
just
so
that
before
we
pass
this
that
i
--
that
i
cover
a
little
more
fully.
it
has
been
said
that
the
treasury
department's
letter
which
is
exhibit
a
next
to
the
complaint
that
this
is
the
approval
of
the
petitioner's
operation.
and
i
think
it
should
be
recognized
only
for
what
it
actually
and
expressly
approves.
the
letter
of
the
treasury
department
does
not
approve
the
operation
as
free
of
state
regulation.
it
merely
approves
the
operation
as
quote
‚Äúfree
of
duty
and
tax‚Äù.
and
the
tariff
act,
too,
when
the
regulation
is
there
under
deal
with
only
with
duties
and
taxes.
and
the
letter
of
the
new
york
state
department
of
taxation
to
which
mr.
tuttle
referred
simply
says
that
it
shall
be
free
from
state
taxes,
the
various
cases
that
he
cites,
the
case
which
he
fought
and
this
is
important
because
it
shows
the
--
what
i
believe
to
be
his
misconception
of
the
point.
his
addendum,
he
thought
it's
important
enough
to
make
an
addendum
to
all
of
his
briefs,
a
verbatim
and
complete
copy
of
the
wisconsin
decision
in
morton
(ph)
against
the
board
of
review.
and
the
very
first
paragraph
of
that
decision,
judge
--
chief
judge
bradford
said
the
issue
here
is
whether
merchandise
imported
for
sale
and
kept
on
hand
by
the
import
of
wholesale
to
meet
current
or
anticipated
business
demand
is
protected
by
article
i
section
7
clause
2
of
the
united
states
constitution
from
the
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax.
now,
we
don't
say
that
we
have
the
paramount
power
to
tax
and
thereby
interfere
with
interstate
commerce
or
foreign
commerce
or
areas
where
the
federal
government
is
preempted
under
the
tariff
act.
but
we
say,
and
we
dot
even
claim
as
to
general
police
powers,
but
we
say
as
to
that
cause
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
was
reserved
to
us
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
where
do
have
the
--
the
paramount
powers
of
regulation.
now,
as
a
result
of
the
questioning,
i
have
skipped
around
and
frankly
i
--
i
should
like
to
just
hurriedly
now,
just
to
make
a
few
points.
the
petitioner
asserts
that
--
well,
i'll
cover
the
state
question.
he
asserts
that
the
adequate
--
the
state
remedy
is
not
adequate.
and
i
pointed
out
that
the
--
he
has
his
action
for
declaratory
judgment.
and
i
was
discussing,
when
i
was
interrupted,
the
fact
that
under
sections
877
and
879
of
the
cpa,
he
can
get
complete
and
unlimited
restraint
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
i
won't
read
it,
i'll
leave
it
to
your
honors
to
read
at
the
brief.
his
claim
for
inadequacy
of
relief
falling,
he
then
claims
that
there's
no
state
action
now
pending
and
therefore
they
can't
be
abstention.
and
of
course,
this
court
has
many
times
ordered
abstention
where
no
state
action
was
presently
pending.
for
example
in
albertson
against
millard,
the
court
remanded
it
to
the
lower
court
to
hold
the
proceedings
in
advance
the
reasonable
time
pending
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
state
courts
either
impending
litigation
or
other
litigation
which
may
be
instituted.
and
in
spector
motor
service
against
mclaughlin,
it
--
the
remand
was
quote
with
directions
to
retain
the
bill
pending
the
determination
of
proceedings
to
be
brought
with
reasonable
constitute.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
so
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
alright.
now
then,
i
should
like,
for
just
for
a
moment,
spend
some
time
if
i
may
on
the
certiorari.
now
here,
we're
in
a
tricky
area.
the
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
may
be
considered
either
on
the
basis
of
assumption
of
jurisdiction
in
the
single
judge
court
or
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
single
judge
court.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
spend
too
much
time
on
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction
because
i've
argued
that
with
respect
to
the
petition
for
mandamus.
but
i
merely
want
to
add
this
that
if
the
single
judge
district
court
had
jurisdiction
then
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction
accepting
that
its
action
instead
of
being
to
dismiss
the
appeal
should
have
been
to
affirm,
according
to
our
contention.
since
the
ultimate
result
would
be
the
same
neither
event,
i
see
no
point
in
--
in
the
--
in
--
on
--
in
paying
any
attention
to
that
aspect.
now,
if
the
single
judge
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
then
of
course
we
have
the
stratton
situation
where
the
court
of
appeals
says
the
single
judge
district
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
therefore,
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
because
if
we
were
to
take
jurisdiction,
we
would
be
supplanting
the
statutory
scheme
for
direct
appeal
from
the
single
judge
court
--
from
the
three-judge
court
to
the
supreme
court.
and
therefore,
they
should
dismiss
the
appeal.
that
was
what
said
in
stratton.
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case.
if
this
court
was
to
follow
stratton,
it
would
have
to
tell
the
court
to
do
exactly
what
has
already
done.
now,
lastly,
i'll
admit
that
it
was
born
of
a
spirit
of
impatience
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
may
i
just
take
a
moment,
i
see
the
--
my
time
is
almost
up.
just
to
make
some
comments
about
my
practical
solution.
i'll
admit
that
it
was
born
on
the
spirit
of
impatience
with
the
fact
that
the
rules
should
have
become
such
that
six
judges
seating,
three
in
the
district
level
and
three
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
plus
attorneys
and
the
attorney
general's
office
plus
eminent
counsel
mr.
tuttle
could
have
become
embroiled
in
such
awfulness.
and
so
purely
for
the
sake
of
cutting
the
gordian
knot,
without
minimizing
the
force
of
any
of
the
objection
for
that
made
or
any
of
the
arguments
that
i've
made.
i
have
suggested
this
alternative
suggestion
--
alternative
method
of
remanding
it
to
the
single
judge
granting
the
petition
for
mandamus,
directing
him
to
request
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court
but
directing
the
three-judge
court
to
abstain
pending
determination
of
the
state
question.
now,
there
are
a
several
things
i
think
your
honors
ought
to
consider.
first
place,
the
question
of
whether
abstention
should
have
in
the
first
instance
be
considered
by
the
three-judge
court
of
the
first
or
the
single
judge
court
would
be
out,
we
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
that.
the
question
of
the
restraints
whether
we
give
them
voluntary
assurances
or
whether
they
have
it
under
the
state
statute
would
be
out
because
of
three-judge
court
unquestionably
could
restrain.
but
lastly
and
most
importantly,
i
think,
is
the
fact
that
actually
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
a
single
judge
court
or
a
three-judge
court
which
abstains.
because
if
the
cases
preempted
to
the
state
courts
in
the
manner
of
which
this
court
in
the
windsor
case,
on
the
second
remain,
said
it
should
be
remanded
where
it
said
that
it
should
--
the
state
question
should
be
decided
by
the
state
court
in
the
light
of
the
constitutional
objections
which
were
presented
to
the
federal
court.
the
entire
case
would
be
before
the
state
court.
in
other
words,
not
merely
was
this
is
a
sale,
but
assuming
it
was
a
sale,
does
it
violate
the
federal
constitution
in
the
respects
alleged
by
the
petitioners.
that
being
so,
when
it
goes
through
the
three
tiers
of
the
state
court,
it
will
be
reviewable
by
this
court
directly
on
certiorari,
thereby
effectively
bypassing
the
--
the
district
court
whether
it'd
be
single
judge
or
three
-judge
court.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
think
they
can
--
i
think
they
can
come
here
directly.
and
i
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
i
--
i
think
they
--
i
think
they
--
they
ought
to
be
permitted
some
way
or
to
be
found
for
them
to
do
it
for
this
reason
that
if
they
go
back
to
the
district
court,
you
might
then
find
some
conflicting
decisions
between
at
least
in
the
ultimate
aspect
of
the
case
before
it
gets
here,
between
the
federal
court
of
appeals
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
and
the
only
--
the
only
dangerous
thing
ultimately
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
we
got
a
complete
decision
from
this
court
no
matter
what
--
whether
they
had
disagreed
or
not.
but
assume
the
odd
situation
that
we
had
only
eight
judges
sitting
as
we
have
right
now
and
we
had
a
--
a
44
decision
in
which
would
be
the
law,
the
federal
court
of
appeals
or
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
