justice
william
o.

i
thought
that
--
mr.
tuttle
that
you
perhaps
would
start
with
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
say
that
it
talks
about
importation
not
exportation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
a
costumer,
isn't?
either
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
constitutional
statute.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
are
you
tendering
them
the
proposition
that
the
litigation
started
pursuant
to
the
authorization
of
congress
in
the
federal
district
court
challenged
in
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
must
go
to
be
transferred
to
the
state
tribunal,
is
that
your
proposition?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
is
there
dubious
here?
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
has
taken
a
clear
definite
position,
(voice

--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
as
the
law,
he
speaks,
this
is
not
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
this
is
the
man
who
commands
the
law
enforcement
agencies.
he
says
this
is
what
i'm
going
to
do
if
you
do
this.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
this
is
not
just
--
he's
not
--
the
petitioner
isn't
dreaming
imaginary
things.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
i
just
wonder
what
theory
do
you
make
the
federal
court
sort
of
the
secondary
tribunals.
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
long
does
it
take
litigant
to
get
through
a
trial
court
in
your
state
to
the
court
of
appeals
these
days?
justice
william
o.
douglas
there's
a
question
of
law
then
we
--
all
that
it's
in
question
on
that
--
on
affidavit,
would
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
long
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
how
long
does
it
take
a
case
of
that
kind
to
get
through
your
court?
justice
william
o.
douglas
have
you
found
any
export
cases
under
(voice
