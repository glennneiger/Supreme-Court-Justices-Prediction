mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
preliminarily,
i
--
may
i
say
that
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
state
decisions
in
which
meba
has
been
involved,
the
one
is
in
re
kelleher,
40
california
second
424,
254
pacific
second
572.
now,
as
respondents
understand
the
situation
in
this
court,
the
facts
which
define
and
delimit
the
issue
before
this
court
are
conclusively
determined
by
the
findings
of
fact
made
in
the
trail
court.
none
of
which
is
or
successfully
could
be
challenged.
now,
i
--
and
to
avoid
any
conclusion
i
may
make,
what
i
hope
is
a
clarifying
statement.
the
counsel
refers
to
a
statement
made
--
of
course,
may
i
say
to
a
sentence
in
a
memorandum
filed
december
1,
1959
by
the
court
in
connection
with
the
proceeding
for
a
preliminary
injunction
and
they
state
referred
to
the
first
sentence
on
re
--
record
18
in
this
court.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
this
is
the
trial
court's
memorandum.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
and
in
their
brief,
they
completely
emasculate
and
misrepresent
this
statement
admitting
the
fact,
the
first
part.
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
show
the
meba
local
101
admits
to
membership
any
non-supervisory
employee.
and
then
they
have
said
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
record
18,
sir.
and
it
is
the
first
sentence
in
the
second
full
paragraph
on
that
page.
the
record
in
this
printed
record
in
this
court.
then
another
thing
upon
which
they
rely
is
the
statement
by
their
trial
counsel
which
is
printed
in
the
record
in
this
court
at
pages
24-26,
i
believe.
now,
the
record
before
the
minnesota
supreme
court
was
filed
when
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
are
you
talking
about
the
printed
record?
i
am,
sir.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
at
page
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
--
24
i
think,
to
26.
that
is
where
they
undertake
to
derive
some
of
the
facts
upon
which
they
predicate
their
argument.
that
statement
was
merely
not
a
stipulation
and
it
was
merely
a
statement
made
by
counsel
and
was
admissible
only
or
at
evident
revalue
only
insofar
as
it
constitute
in
admission
against
it.
and
that
is
expressly
so
stated
by
the
trial
court
and
the
printed
records
before
the
state
supreme
courts
at
page
114,
a
copy
of
which
was
filed
with
this
court
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
at
least
confusing
as
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
for
petitioners
in
their
statement
of
the
case
and
elsewhere
do
not
refer
to
the
ultimate
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
trail
court
after
hearing
on
the
merits
and
pursuant
to
which
the
permanent
injunction
was
issued
anywhere
in
their
brief,
instead,
when
they
do
refer
to
any
findings,
they
are
the
preliminary
unamended
findings
which
were
made
in
connection
with
the
order
to
grant
a
preliminary
injunction.
now
as
many
as
cases,
i
think
it
makes
no
difference
but
it
certainly
is
confusing
to
me
and
i
should
think
it
would
be
to
the
court
to
have
record
citations
to
something
other
than
the
final
findings
which
were
adopted
in
the
trail
court
and
which
on
the
basis
of
its
degree.
now
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
(inaudible)
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
pardon?
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i
think
the
final
findings
begin
on
--
on
page
29,
sir.
and
they're
the
ones
that
are
dated
or
filed
on
march
16,
1960.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
i
re
--
i
rely
in
all
of
them.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
no,
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i'm
afraid
i
have
only
added
to
confusion.
i
wanted
to
say
that
merely
that
the
defendants
or
--
or
petitioners'
brief,
their
statement
of
facts
ignored
these
findings.
our
statement
of
brief
rest
wholly
upon
these
findings
which
were
the
basis
of
the
degree.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
if
your
honor
please.
i
don't
put
it
--
i
--
i
think
all
of
them
are
conclusive
as
far
as
the
facts
they
find.
now,
i
think
the
effect
is
--
is
--
of
their
findings,
the
appropriate
ones
is
also
conclusive.
but
i
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
no.
for
instance,
finding
13
on
page
32,
is
conclusive
upon
a
proposition
which
however
is
not
challenged
that
the
trail
court
directly
held
that
all
employees
of
respondents
are
supervisors.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i
reply
--
rely
on
finding
2
of
page
29
of
the
record,
printed
record
in
this
court.
the
defendant,
marine
engineers
be
--
beneficial
association,
local
101
here
and
after
referred
to
as
meba
is
a
voluntary
unincorporated
association
which
submit
--
admit
the
membership
licensed
marine
engineers
employed
on
commercial
vessels
on
the
great
lakes.
now
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
and
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
kind
of
worthy
that
that
is
true.
now,
the
only
thing
that's
in
the
record
from
the
bull
case
is
an
affidavit
of
the
president
of
this
union
who
swore
that
they
never
admitted
to
membership,
any
members
other
than
supervisor
engineers.
now,
as
i
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
only
question
raised,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
i
--
i
think
the
evidence,
only
evidence
there
is,
is
to
the
effect
that
the
--
they
take
members
of
the
license
of
marine
engineers
under
great
lakes.
those
are
live
steam
vessel
and
that
all
of
those
are
supervisor
--
engineer
supervisors.
now,
i
think
that
if
there
is
any
exception
to
that,
the
burden
is
upon
these
petitioners
to
prove
it.
they
know
who
are
their
members
are
and
they
can
bring
the
fool
but
they
didn't
do
it.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
suppose
i'm
wrong,
my
printed
proposition
as
i
hoped
to
develop
is
that
assuming
that
this
local
101
did
have
this
counsel
argued
two
or
three
non-supervisor
members
but
otherwise,
its
membership
was
--
are
composed
of
supervisors
and
that
we
have
here
an
activity
directed
to
trying
to
compel
an
employer
to
recognize
that
role
call
as
the
bargaining
agent
for
its
admittedly
supervisor
personnel
that
would
still
not
deprive
the
state
courts
of
jurisdiction.
now,
i'd
like
to
just
proceed
to
state
my
theory,
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
will
agree,
i
hope
they
will
but
at
least
i
--
i
like
to
present
it
briefly.
i'll
start
with
the
--
this
proposition,
the
--
in
1947,
the
congress
in
amending
the
national
labor
relations
act
of
1935,
undertook
to
exclude
the
area
of
labor
relations
between
supervisors
and
their
employers
from
the
nlra
and
from
the
jurisdiction
of
nlrb.
they
did
that
in
part
by
redefining
employee
and
perhaps
to
some
extent,
employer
and
by
defining
of
supervisor
so
that
it
would
be
certain
what
they
meant.
now,
that
--
if
--
if
the
language
could
otherwise
be
subject
to
a
different
interpretation,
i
submit
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
real
legislative
history,
the
reports
of
the
committees,
of
the
senate
and
the
house
and
statement
of
the
--
of
the
persons
or
the
members
of
congress
in
charge
of
the
bill
on
their
respective
groups
conclusively
established
that
this
was
on
--
the
congressional
intent
and
that
among
other
things,
they
regarded
it
as
a
highly
important
principle.
that
--
the
--
that
--
neither
that
--
supervisors
should
not
be
permitted
to
engage
in
the
regulatory
federal
scheme
on
behalf
of
employees
and
perhaps
on
behalf
of
employers.
now
--
and
when
--
before
i
go
to
the
sentence
of
my
argument,
i
mentioned
another
thing
and
that
is
section
14
(a).
now
in
the
original
act,
it's
printed
at
page
41
of
our
brief
in
the
appendix
that
dealt
--
by
preceded
in
the
act
by
the
word
limitations,
now
in
other
words,
congress
put
in
as
in
--
as
a
limitation
upon
what
it
had
done
before
with
respect
to
amendments
and
specifically
with
respect
to
the
exclusion
of
supervisors
from
the
area
of
labor
relations
covered
by
the
federal
act.
now,
they
started
and
they
say,
"nothing
herein
so
prohibit
any
individual
as
the
supervisor
from
becoming
or
remaining
a
member
of
a
labor
organization."
to
me
that
seemed
unnecessary
but
it
seems
to
me
of
this
that
they
put
therein
and
then
says
nothing
herein,
that's
in
these
amendments
shall
be
so
construed
to
avoid
the
possibility
that
the
existence
of
the
amended
federal
act
or
the
amendments
themselves
should
be
construed
to
prohibit
supervisors
from
joining
unions
where
they
were
permitted
to
do
so
under
state
law.
now
prior
of
course
to
the
act
of
1935,
labor
relations
had
been
in
general
and
as
far
as
here
con
--
concerned
exclusively
regulated
by
the
states
and
congress
was
remitting
this
area
of
labor
relations
to
state
regulations.
now
then
however,
they
were
so
concerned
about
what
they
thought
were
the
evil
effects
of
the
earlier
act
which
had
been
construed
in
the
petrov
case
that
they
added
but
no
employer
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
other
--
of
employer
subject
to
this
act
shall
be
compelled
to
deem
individuals
defined
herein
as
supervisors,
as
employees
for
the
purpose
of
any
law,
either
national
or
local,
relating
two
collective
bargaining.
now
as
--
any
at
all,
that
isn't
this,
this
amendment.
now
i
--
i
think
this
was
another
cautionary
move
which
they
did
not
--
they'd
--
they
--
in
which
they
wanted
to
make
clear
or
to
provide
rather
that
while
they
were
remitting
to
the
state,
the
area
of
labor
relations
which
is
--
consist
of
those
between
supervisors
and
their
employers.
they
weren't
--
were
not
to
--
permitted
to
enact
interstate
law
the
rule
of
the
packard
decision.
now,
our
--
our
position
broadly
is
this.
the
real
question,
i
may
state
somewhat
as
following.
did
the
minnesota
state
court
have
jurisdiction
or
the
right
to
exercise
jurisdiction
in
an
area
of
labor
relation
which
the
congress
expressly
excluded
from
the
operation
of
the
nl
--
nlra
and
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb
where
--
in
order
to
enforce
the
statutes
in
public
policy
of
the
state
of
minnesota.
in
other
words,
to
enjoin
a
continuing
violation
of
the
state
statutes
and
interstate
public
policy
insofar
as
there
was
no
limitation
in
both.
now,
my
contention
is
that,
as
i
involved
here,
they
plainly
had
that
jurisdiction
subject
only
to
the
limitation
that
they
couldn't
enact
in
interstate
law
the
(inaudible)
decision
which
had
lead
congress
in
large
part
to
enact
the
amendments
relating
to
the
--
to
supervisors.
now,
we
come
then
to
--
to
the
proposition,
the
contrary
proposition
which
is
edged
by
our
brother
in
--
on
the
other
side.
i
think
we
have
to
approach
this
matter
from
this
standpoint.
at
least
in
my
view
obviously
if
the
1904
decide
to
amend
seven
amendments,
the
congress
undertook
to
exclude
the
area
of
labor
management
relations
here
involved
from
the
federal
statute
and
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
board.
now,
when
we
come
to
--
if,
and
i
am
doubtful
at
that,
if
it
were
true
that
you
could
make
a
technical
argument
that
some
sections
of
the
act,
nlra
applied
to
some
sort
of
convict
with
--
in
which
a
union
of
supervisors
engaged,
it
would
be
unthinkable
that
call
--
that
this
court
or
any
court
would
cease
upon
that
technical
and
literal
construction
to
defeat
the
clearer
intention
of
the
congress
which
was
to
restore
the
regulation
of
this
area
of
labor
relations
to
the
state.
now,
as
i
think
mr.
pressman
conceded
and
as
mr.
friendly's,
well
then
passing,
may
i
say
before
i
--
i
go
on.
without
going
into
detail,
in
my
opinion,
the
three
decisions
of
this
court
upon
which
petitioners
principally
rely
have
no
applications
whatever
to
the
instant
case.
so
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the
first
case,
state
case
in
which
the
question
has
clearly
been
raised
as
to
whether
doctrines
of
federal
preemptions
or
primary
administrative
jurisdiction
bar
the
exercise
of
state
power
in
a
field
of
labor
relations
which
the
congress
has
expressly
excluded
from
federal
regulation.
in
the
case
in
which
mr.
pressman
principally
relied
that
is
the
decision
in
274
f.2d
137,
the
court
did
nothing
more
than
to
hold
that
upon
a
basis
of
their
sketchy
record
there
presented,
and
under
the
principles
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
universal
ever
--
ever
--
camera
case
it
could
not
say
that
there
was
no
basis
for
a
finding
or
holding
of
the
nlrb
that
in
that
particular
case
whatever
part
of
meba
was
involved
was
a
labor
organization.
now,
the
court
went
on
and
however
it
--
to
say
that
we
are
not
binding
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
they
relied
in
part
upon
an
old
admission
and
an
old
pleading
and
upon
some
very
--
they
have
court's
passing
--
they
felt
there
rather
inferences
drawn
from
not
the
very
good
development
of
the
facts.
there
--
but
the
court
said
that
they
--
they
could've
shown
more.
the
union,
they
certainly
knew
who
their
members
were
or
if
they
didn't
they
could
find
out
and
they
didn't
offer
any
proof
and
therefore,
their
court
wouldn't
upset
it.
but
it
expressly
said
it
was
just
approving
it
on
those
facts.
now,
i
think
it's
very
significant
to
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
--
i
--
i
would
like
to
just
rely
to
your
honors'
attention
to
the
later
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
another
field
but
in
which
this
case
wasn't
urged
and
where
this
union
again
contended
that
it
was
not
a
labor
organization.
that
is
the
decision
in
294
of
f.2d
relating
to
the
emergency
injunction.
in
that
case
judge
friendly
had
occasion
to
refer
to
it
again
and
says
this
case,
he
said
in
national
ma
--
marine
engineers
beneficial
association,
the
nlrb,
second
circuit,
though
we
accepted
the
proposition
that
a
union
comprise
only
of
several
supervisors
would
not
be
a
labor
organization
within
section
8
(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
held
that
on
the
facts
there
presented,
the
board
was
justified
in
finding
that
non-supervisory
employees
participated
in
these
two
unions
and
hence,
in
holding
them
within
that
section.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
that
case
involved
tugboats
or
towboats
and
barges
on
england
waters,
as
i
think
was
suggested
by
or
at
least
to
--
raised
by
question
of
one
of
the
justices
that
the
states
in
between
this
large
boat
carry
--
cargo
carrying
steamers
on
the
great
lakes.
and
these
small
barges
and
towboats
and
the
like
on
england
waters
is
very
great
and
in
some
of
the
nlrb
decisions
which
are
cited
by
petitioners,
they
stressed
that
and
point
out
their
completely
different
situation.
your
honor,
we
have
--
i
--
i
recognize
myself
to
this
point
one
moment.
the
only
--
the
basis
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
our
plaintiff
argument
is,
as
i
analyze
it,
first,
that
the
jurisdiction
of
these
courts
were,
state
courts,
could
not
be
exercised
because
of
doctrine
of
federal
preemption.
now,
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
decision
of
this
court
which
holds
that
where
the
congress
in
undertaking
to
regulate
part
of
a
field
has
specifically
excluded
what
another
applied
from
federal
regulation.
nevertheless,
it
has
preempted
the
state
courts
from
acting
in
that
excluded
field.
it
has
always
been
the
law
for
many
years
that
the
mere
enactment
of
a
federal
statute
stick
--
to
a
federal
statute
did
not
oust
the
states
of
all
the
jurisdiction.
certainly,
has
been
settled
in
without
question
that
congress
may
regulate
a
power
but
only
a
power
of
subject
matter
over
which
it
could
exercise
exclusive
power.
so,
i
--
i
said
can't
be
on
that
doctrine.
then
it
is
on
--
it
has
to
be
on
the
doctrine
of
primary
administrative
jurisdiction.
i
submit
that
is
--
is
also
unavailing.
first,
i
do
not
know
their
--
any
decision
of
this
court
that
holds
whereas
here,
the
congress
has
carved
out
part
of
the
subject
matter
of
a
particular
federal
regulation
and
left
it
to
the
states
that
the
question
as
to
whether
a
particular
case
follows
within
the
area
of
that
subject
matter
cannot
be
decided
by
a
state
court
or
a
federal
district
court
in
which
the
question
is
presented.
but
they
must
stay
awake
until
this
administrative
agency
makes
a
decision.
now
here,
there's
nothing
involved
but
questions
of
law.
there's
nothing
inconceivably
that
could
be
suggested
which
is
not
within
the
con
--
conventional
experience
of
every
justice
on
this
bench,
nothing
of
any
of
the
reasons
for
it.
but
i
think
the
primary
thing
is
that
in
the
--
where
the
question
is
as
to
a
--
a
--
something
falling
within
an
area
which
congress
has
expressly
excluded
from
certain
federal
regulations.
it
would
be
unthinkable
that
the
courts
could
not
decide
that
issue
but
must
send
it
to
an
administrative
tribunal.
it
is
the
same
thing
as
though
the
question
is
raised
as
to
whether
something
that
union
or
interstate
commerce
are
effecting
interstate
commerce
in
the
very
--
by
the
decision
of
justice
brandeis
in
270
u.s.
--
way
back
to
270
u.s.
he
states
the
claim
that
--
question
as
to
whether
a
particular
act
was
excluded
from
the
federal
statute
which
preserve
precisely
the
same
ground
as
did
the
question
as
to
whether
it
was
in
interstate,
i
think,
it
was
in
interstate
commerce
for
--
i
think
it
was
in
in
those
days,
i
don't
believe
they
went
to
affect
this.
and
--
so
i
come
briefly
to
this,
i
do
not
think
that
--
well
on
the
first
place,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
judge
friendly
did
not
hold
that
a
union
of
supervisors
can
avoid
the
state
regulations,
the
field
of
government
in
which
the
regulation
is
omitted
--
remitted
by
taking
in
one
or
two
non-supervisory
members.
but
we
come
down
to
this
unrealistic
technical
argument,
the
only
argument
--
so
apparently
it
can
be
advanced
that
this
union
can
be,
if
it
has
two
non-supervisor
members
among
10,000
then
the
states
cannot
exercise
their
regulatory
power
and
their
courts
cannot
enjoin
a
continuing
violation
of
the
state
statutes
and
state
public
policy.
i
do
not
believe
that
such
a
theory
would
ever
be
adopted
by
any
court
and
certainly
is
contrary
to
what
this
court
said
in
the
ryan
case
294,
i
believe
it
is
u.s,
but
i
--
i
--
i
think
to
394.
i
--
i'm
(inaudible)
why
shouldn't
--
i
may
be
wrong.
now
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
they
have
--
they
have
--
have
this
case
which
would
end
up
before
judge
friendly
which
involved
these
towboats
in
--
on
there
-
on
it
--
they
have
--
and
i
don't
know,
they
--
they
are
held
that
there
was
reasonable
ground
for
enjoining
what
they
were
doing
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
there
has
been
a
number
of
cases
on
the
great
involving
ships
neither
here
comparable
on
the
great
lakes
and
they
held
there
that
none
of
the
engineers
or
one
of
them
suited
specifically
our
time
on
tho
--
on
those
vessels
are
employees
that
they
are
all
supervisors.
but
i
submit
on
this
question,
it's
some
--
it's
something
which
has
to
be
decided
by
the
court.
now,
starting
with
the
premise
that
the
--
that
the
united
--
congress
has
remitted
this
area
of
labor
regulations
to
the
regulations
of
the
states
world
war
before
1935
subject
only
to
a
limitation
i
mentioned.
to
--
and
then
to
say
that
if
a
union
of
those
supervisors
contains
one
or
two
non-supervisor
members,
who
would
be
employees
under
the
act.
the
whole
congressional
purpose
is
defeated
is
certainly
inadmissible.
i
also
say
that
if
it
were
technically
true,
that
the
means
which
are
being
used
by
such
a
union
of
supervisors
could
also
be
regarded
in
a
certain
aspect
as
a
--
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8
(b).
that
could
not
reasonably
be
made
the
basis
of
foreclosing
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
in
this
excluded
area
of
labor
regulations
that
would
go
far
beyond
permitting
the
tail
to
wag
the
dog.
and
it
would
be
using
a
very
technical
and
narrow
thing
in
--
under
periphery
of
the
law
have
anything
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
could
defeat
the
clear
intent
of
congress
in
this
--
enacting
these
amendments
in
1947.
i
submit
that
if
there's
any
change
in
that
respect
to
be
made,
these
gentlemen
should
make
their
appeal
to
the
congress.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i
think
undoubtedly
they
would
have,
sir.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i
think
they
would
have,
why?
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
because
--
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
their,
the
organization
is
overwhelmingly
controlled
by
employees
under
the
act.
and
it
falls
naturally
that
they
are
going
to
be
engaged
principally
in
that
--
in
the
kind
of
better
--
betterly
working
conditions
of
employees.
i'd
like
to
add
another
thing,
it
seems
to
me
we
don't
reach
it
here,
but
if
we
did
reach
the
que
--
that
question,
i
--
i
suggest
this.
conceivably,
a
union
might
have
many
employees
and
it
might
have
many
supervisors,
either
in
locals
or
non-integrated
basis
or
an
integrated
basis,
very
large
number.
now,
i
submit
that
the
only
realistic
test
would
be
whether
the
activity
of
that
union
is
directed
to
trying
to
organize
supervisors
who
are
expressly
excluded
from
the
act
or
whether
they
are
trying
to
organize,
i'm
taking
of
illustration
only,
employees
under
the
act.
it
seems
to
me
it
requires
reasonable
to
say
--
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
pardon?
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
i
think
if
it
is
close
enough,
it
might
be
that
the
court
couldn't
but
if
its
close
--
if
it
isn't
closed,
certainly
isn't
here
i
don't
get
any
question
about.
for
instance,
american
trust
company,
it
engages
in
banking
business,
engage
in
a
trusting
business.
nobody
would
suggest
that
for
the
same
principles
of
law
are
applicable
in
both
capacities.
no
more
do
i
think
that
the
same
would
be
applicable
to
a
union
in
different
capacity.
but
i
don't
think
we
ever
reached
that
question
here.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
i
agree
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
raymond
t.
jackson
well,
i
would
think
that
if
it
was
--
if
it
was
presented
in
the
field
of
permitting
supervisors
--
of
requiring
employers
to
a
--
to
--
engaged
in
collective
bargaining,
it
recognizes
that
way,
it
would
not
be
good.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
was.
i
have
erroneously
of
procedure
on
that
theory
that
the
decision
of
the
questions
of
state
law
by
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
are
conclusive
here
both
because
they
have
not
been
challenged.
and
also
because
i
understand
the
rule
of
this
court
could
be
that
the
interpretation
of
the
state
law
by
its
highest
court
is
all
through
conclusive
except
in
certain
constitutional
situations
where
there
might
seem
to
be
an
effort
to
avoid
the
federal
constitution.
