mr.
lee
pressman
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
a
--
an
appeal
taken
from
the
order
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
which
affirmed
an
injunction
issued
by
the
court
below
that
restrained
peaceful
picketing
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
involved
in
this
case.
the
petitioners
are
the
national
marine
engineers
beneficial
association
and
an
affiliated
local
101
both
being
unincorporated
labor
unions
admitting
into
membership
marine
engineers
who
work
on
the
self-propelled
vessels
under
american
flag
on
the
deep
sea,
great
lakes,
the
rivers
and
the
inland
harbors.
the
respondent
here
or
respondents
namely
two,
the
interlake
steamship
company
and
the
pickands
mather,
one
is
the
owner
and
the
other
is
the
operating
agent
of
a
fleet
of
vessels
on
the
great
lakes.
they
happened
to
be
the
second
largest
operator
of
vessels
on
the
great
lakes.
a
dispute
arose
between
the
petitioners
on
the
one
hand
and
the
respondents
on
the
other
with
respect
to
the
organizing
or
recognition
of
the
marine
engineers
of
the
respondents.
it
has
been
found
below
and
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
marine
engineers
of
the
respondents
are
what
is
termed
"supervisors"
as
defined
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
however,
as
a
result
of
this
dispute,
the
petitioners
established
a
picket
line
on
a
date
namely
november
12,
1959.
the
picket
line
was
established
at
the
dock
of
a
secondary
employer
namely
the
colorado
fuel
and
coal
company
or
coal
and
fuel
company
at
which
place
a
vessel
of
the
respondents
was
then
placed
unloading
its
cargo.
also,
a
picket
line
was
established
either
the
same
or
the
next
day
at
the
plant
of
another
secondary
employer
namely
interlake
iron
company.
when
the
picket
line
was
established
at
both
these
places
with
respect
to
the
first,
it
has
been
found
below
that
the
employees
of
the
secondary
employer
refused
to
work,
ceased
working
and
as
a
result,
has
been
found
below,
the
colorado
fuel
and
--
fuel
company
was
not
able
to
continue
working
as
it
was
supposed
to
on
the
ship
for
the
respondents.
mr.
lee
pressman
no.
mr.
lee
pressman
the
union
had
no
members
at
the
colorado
--
at
the
carnegie,
i'm
sorry,
i
should
have
said
carnegie
coal
and
fuel
company
nor
did
the
union
have
any
members
at
the
interlake
iron
company.
on
the
picket
line,
there
were
no
employees
of
either
the
secondary
employers.
mr.
lee
pressman
actually
--
mr.
lee
pressman
that
is
the
issue
which
i'd
like
to
come
to
later,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
pressman
before
the
lower
court,
a
first
a
restraining
order
was
issued
and
then
after
hearing,
the
restraining
order
was
merged
into
a
temporary
injunction
and
finally
into
a
permanent
injunction.
below,
in
the
court
below,
it
was
found
and
the
court
made
its
findings
to
the
effect
that
what
i've
just
recited
had
occurred
namely
the
picketing
at
the
premises
of
the
secondary
employer.
and
though
the
petitioners
urged
that
in
the
face
of
those
facts,
activity
had
been
presented
which
could
reasonably
or
arguably
be
held
to
fall
within
the
purview
of
certain
positions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
contention
was
dismissed
and
the
court
issued
its
orders,
holding
in
effect
that
by
virtue
of
the
picketing
at
the
premises
of
the
secondary
employer
and
compelling
the
secondary
employer
to
cease
doing
its
business,
it
had
the
purpose
of
forcing
the
respondents
to
recognize
this
union
and
to
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
contents
of
which
would
have
been
in
violation
of
minnesota
statutes
and
minnesota
public
policy
and
the
orders
were
issued.
the
orders
were
directed
specifically
among
other
things
at
ceased
the
picketing
and
ceasing,
having
the
picketing
ceased
at
the
premises
of
the
secondary
employer.
the
simple
question
that
we've
submit
is
involved
in
this
appeal
is
whether
where
you
have
a
union
which
--
as
we
will
demonstrate,
is
primarily,
not
exclusively
but
primarily,
composed
of
what
is
known
as
"supervisors"
engaging
in
activity
where
the
dispute
is
admittedly
over
a
group
of
employees
or
workers
of
the
primary
employer
who
are
supervisors.
but
where
the
activity
involves
the
employees
of
a
secondary
employer
as
in
this
case
is
that
kind
of
a
situation
reasonably
or
arguably
within
the
purview
of
a
provision
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
therefore
preempted
for
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb.
the
specfi
--
the
specific
provision
of
the
statute
to
which
we
have
reference
is
what
is
known
as
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
commonly
referred
to
as
the
secondary
boycott
provision.
i'd
like
to
pause
for
a
moment
and
point
out
that
at
the
time
this
dispute
arose,
the
provision
of
the
secondary
boycott
provision
was
so
designated
as
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
subsequently,
they
were
amendments
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
under
what
is
commonly
referred
to
as
the
landrum-griffin
act
in
which
that
provision
became
what
is
now
known
as
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
for
our
purposes,
the
amendment
did
not
change
the
impact
of
the
issue
which
we
are
raising.
i
shall
henceforth
referred
therefore
to
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
since
that
was
the
provision
involved
in
our
case.
i
wish
to
at
this
moment,
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
essence
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
the
secondary
boycott
provision
which
is
that
where
a
labor
organization,
which
is
one
necessary
ingredient,
induces
or
encourages
the
employees
of
another
employer,
what
i
call
a
secondary
employer,
to
cease
their
work
and
the
--
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
secondary
employer
cease
his
operations
or
his
relationship
with
the
primary
employer,
that
is
the
essence
of
the
offense
under
the
secondary
boycott
provision.
i
don't
believe
i
need
emphasize
here
the
framework
that
has
been
established
by
this
court
in
three
outstanding
cases
as
to
when
do
we
have
preemption
in
favor
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
we
have
the
garner
versus
teamsters
case,
the
weber
and
anheuser-busch
case
and
the
san
diego
versus
garmon
case.
they
established
the
framework,
which
we
submit
for
our
purposes,
has
established
preemption
in
our
case,
namely
the
simple
test
is
whether
the
type
of
activity
that
has
been
presented
may
reasonably
or
arguably,
not
necessarily
clearly
but
simply
reasonably
or
arguably
indicate
that
the
activity
is
within
the
purview
of
either
the
permissible
or
protected
activity
of
the
act
or
the
prohibited
activity
of
the
labor
act
that
then
establishes
preemption
in
favor
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
lee
pressman
correct
your
honor
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
there's
been
such
confusion
between
the
state
courts
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
previous
cases.
i'd
like
to
make
clear
at
this
point
what
we
concede
because
no
question
about
it,
namely
when
there
are
a
group
of
workers
who
fall
within
a
definition
of
"supervisors",
they
are
excluded
from
the
definition
set
forth
of
the
act
of
the
employees.
you
have
sections
in
the
act
that
so
provide.
mr.
lee
pressman
your
honor,
i've
had
grave
difficulty.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
as
to
the
conduct.
my
difficulty
has
been
in
clarifying
frankly
in
presenting
to
the
courts
below
what
has
been
held
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
lee
pressman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
lee
pressman
for
reasonably
or
arguably
you
mean?
i
would
submit
yes
because
--
actually,
may
i
say
just
to
the
outset,
we
have
here
i
believe
a
very
situation
that
i'm
sure
the
court
had
in
mind
in
enunciating
its
doctrine
of
preemption,
namely
you
will
find
in
the
case
of
meba
versus
national
labor
relations
board
where
the
board
has
held
this
very
organization
to
be
a
labor
organization
for
the
purpose
of
the
secondary
boycott
provision,
the
section
8
(b).
the
second
circuit
upheld
that
order
and
stated
that
and
held
that
meba,
the
very
petitioner
here,
is
a
labor
organization
for
purpose
of
section
8
(b),
the
test
being
one
that
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
on
the
other
hand,
having
been
so
found
by
the
labor
board
and
by
the
federal
court,
we
find
ourselves
confronted
in
the
state
court
where
the
state
court
says,
"we
won't
permit
this
issue
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
we'll
make
the
determination.
and
we're
holding
that
you
are
not
a
labor
organization
for
the
--
within
this
purview
of
section
8
(b)."
mr.
lee
pressman
your
honor,
the
record
shows
the
following.
the
court
below
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
personnel
that
we
were
seeking
to
organize
in
this
case
of
the
primary
employer
were
supervisors,
a
specific
finding
to
that
effect.
mr.
lee
pressman
yes,
there's
no
question
about
that
that
the
marine
engineers
of
the
petitioner
are
supervisors.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
merely
made
in
its
conclusion
of
law,
a
statement
that
the
petitioner
is
not
a
labor
organization
within
the
purview
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
just
a
statement
of
conclusion
of
law.
in
the
memorandum
--
mr.
lee
pressman
i
will
state
now
what
we
have
in
the
record.
in
the
memorandum
of
law
that
a
company
--
the
findings
of
fact
on
the
restraining
order
and
then
was
incorporated,
this
very
memorandum
law
was
incorporated
in
the
amended
findings
of
fact
and
further
and
finally
incorporated
by
the
court's
own
reference
in
the
ultimate
injunction
order
of
a
permanent
character.
the
memorandum
law
has
this
paragraph,
which
what
we
have
here
in
the
record,
"the
record
in
this
case
does
not
show
that
meba
local
101”,
which
is
only
one
of
the
petitioners,
“admits
the
membership
any
supervisory
employee
and
in
any
event”,
that
the
court
went
on
to
say,
"it
is
clear
that
its
membership
is
composed
primarily
and
almost
exclusively
of
supervisors."
the
reason
the
court
in
that
statement
did
not
say
exclusively
or
wholly
is
because
the
record
also
contains
a
statement
of
counsel
for
the
petitioners
in
the
court
below
in
which
statements
have
definitely
was
accepted
into
the
record
not
as
mere
argument
but
as
a
statement
of
fact
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
where
counsel
said
that
“most
of
the
engineers
are
supervisory
employees
of
the
membership
of
the
petitioners",
using
the
word
"most."
in
the
court
below,
there
was
also
presented
and
accepted
into
the
record
a
case
that
had
been
previously
decided
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
ordering
an
election
of
marine
engineers
in
which
the
organization
involved
was
the
predecessor
of
local
101
so
that
the
board
in
holding
that
election
necessarily
was
holding
that
those
marine
engineers
were
employees
and
not
supervisors
and
they
had
been
members
of
the
--
the
same
organization.
that
is
all
we
have
in
the
record,
your
honor.
of
course
in
the
--
before
the
lower
court,
we
had
before
the
court
the
labor
board
decision
in
the
case
involving
the
meba
which
subsequently
became
the
subject
of
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
meba
versus
nlrb.
the
appellate
--
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
had
judge
friendly's
opinion
in
nlr
--
in
meba
versus
nlrb
in
which
there,
there
was
a
final
decision
that
this
very
organization
was
a
labor
organization
within
the
purview
of
the
act.
now,
i
must
confess
that
i
believe
that
in
the
court
below,
both
the
lower
court
and
the
higher
court,
there
was
considerable
confusion
as
to
the
difference
between
what
is
involved
on
the
section
8
(a)
and
what
is
involved
on
the
section
8
(b).
for
example,
in
the
courts
below,
we
pointed
out
that
we
were
--
we
argue
that
in
our
belief
we
were
--
this
case
was
preempted
and
urged
upon
the
court,
a
minnesota
supreme
court
case
of
norris
green
versus
siu.
both
courts
dismissed
that
issue
claiming
that
there
they
said,
the
employees
or
the
workers
of
a
primary
employer
were
employees.
whereas
here
they
said,
the
workers
of
the
primary
employer
are
supervisors.
therefore,
the
case
is
inevitable,
completely
in
error
on
that
--
on
such
conclusion.
when
it
came
to
the
issue
whether
we
were
or
were
not
a
labor
organization,
i
submit
your
honor
that
the
courts
below
did
not
go
into
the
issue
whether
we
were
a
labor
organization
as
interpreted
by
the
nlrb,
namely
in
our
very
case
what
the
labor
board
has
held,
that
if
there
are
two
employees
in
our
organization,
only
two
or
more
and
its
oddly
immaterial,
says
the
national
labor
relations
board,
whether
those
two
are
the
actually
involved
in
the
primary
dispute,
the
courts
said
immaterial.
the
fact
that
we
have
two
workers
who
are
employees,
who
are
our
members,
makes
us
a
labor
organization
and
if
we
become
involved
in
a
dispute
where
the
primary
workers
are
supervisors
but
in
the
course
of
our
dispute,
we
become
involved
inducing
employees
of
a
secondary
employer,
we
are
subjected
to
the
prohibitions
of
section
8
(b).
the
courts
below
simply
refused
to
accept
that
proposition.
mr.
lee
pressman
your
honor,
in
the
complaint,
the
respondents
set
forth
that
there
were
workers
of
carnegie
coal
and
fuel
company
who
were
working
on
that
ship
until
the
picket
line
was
established
and
that
was
--
the
picket
line
was
established
they
ceased
working.
there
was
no
claim
in
the
court
below
that
those
employed
workers
had
any
semblance
to
the
question
of
whether
they
were
supervisors.
they
were
ordinary
workers
in
the
sense
of
being
employees
under
the
act.
now,
there
is
one
case
again
which
i
submit
in
the
court
below
has
misunderstood,
namely
the
case
of
bull
steamship
company
versus
meba.
we
have
been
going
--
when
i
say
“we”,
your
honor,
i
mean
the
petitioners
here,
we've
been
going
through
a
labyrinth
with
the
labor
bard
trying
to
find
out
where
are
we
under
this
act.
in
the
bull
steamship
company
case,
which
is
cited
on
our
brief,
you'll
find
there
a
question
as
to
what
is
the
situation
in
under
section
301
(a)
of
the
act.
where
you
may
recall
suits
maybe
filed
for
breach
of
contract
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization
representing
employees.
judge
clark
writing
the
opinion
in
that
case,
i
submit
held
merely
this
that
to
meet
the
test
of
that
provision,
the
contract
on
which
suit
is
brought
must
cover
at
least
employees.
he
didn't
get
to
the
issue
whether
we
are
a
labor
organization
or
not.
he
merely
found,
as
the
record
disclosed,
that
clearly
enough,
the
people
covered
by
that
specific
contract
were
not
employees
but
supervisors.
there
was
no
contest
on
that
issue.
having
so
found
from
the
record
to
be
the
case,
he
simply
held
that
section
301
could
not
cover
that
contract.
he
didn't
have
to
reach
the
issue
whether
we
are
a
labor
organization.
mr.
lee
pressman
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
i
believe
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
so
that
you
couldn't
even
get
within
the
field
of
reasonably
or
arguably
that
there
was
no
ingredient
such
as
a
labor
organization
then
you
wouldn't
be
within
the
purview
of
section
8
(b).
but
i
do
submit
--
mr.
lee
pressman
your
honor
that's
the
test
that
has
been
laid
down
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
i
might
--
namely,
they
say
that
if
there
are
labor
organizations
defined
as
an
organization
in
which
employees
participate,
the
labor
board
has
held
that
participation
of
employees
merely
requires
two
or
more
and
that
makes
it
a
labor
organization.
i
might
suggest
or
submit
that
in
a
case
called
masters,
mates
and
pilots
versus
n.l.r.b
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
respondents,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
has
remanded
a
similar
case
to
the
board
stating
that
in
there
judgment,
they
believe
a
substantial
number
should
participate
before
making
it
a
labor
organization.
what
the
ultimate
decision
of
the
labor
board
will
be
or
the
courts
in
receiving
appeals
in
that
issue,
i
do
not
know.
we
have
argued
below
in
the
federal
cases
and
before
the
board
that
on
our
humble
judgment,
a
labor
organization
for
purpose
of
8
(b)
in
view
of
the
fact
that
our
members
have
been
excluded
from
section
7
and
section
8
(a)
should
be
an
organization
which
is
primarily
supervisors
and
if
it
is
--
if
it
is
that,
it
shouldn't
be
within
the
purview
section
8
(b).
but
we've
been
overruled
by
the
labor
board
and
the
federal
courts.
so
that
we
are
now
in
a
paradoxical
position
where
before
the
labor
board
and
the
courts
taking
appeals
from
orders
of
the
board,
we're
held
to
be
under
the
purview
of
section
8
(b)
and
then
we
get
in
before
state
courts
and
the
state
courts
simply
disregarded
the
decisions
of
the
nlrb
and
rule
on
their
own.
i
believe
you'll
find
that
from
the
opinions
of
the
lower
court,
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota,
their
whole
thrust
in
determining
whether
we
were
a
labor
organization
or
not
was
that
the
primary
employees
involved
here
were
supervisors.
and
since
they
were
excluded
from
the
national
labor
relations
act,
"certainly"
said
the
courts,
an
injunction
should
be
issued.
it
was
is
a
curious
notion
in
the
courts
below
and
then
a
part
of
counsel
for
the
respondents
that
by
uring
the
issue
of
preemption
here
as
we
are,
that
we're
trying
to
evade
the
law
and
be
in
a
no
man's
land
where
no
one
has
jurisdiction
over
us,
quite
to
the
contrary.
we're
submitting
that
under
the
decisions
of
the
nlrb
and
the
decisions
affirming
there
--
theirs
that
we're
simply
stating
where
within
the
purview
of
section
8
(b)
apparently
and
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
first
decide.
mr.
lee
pressman
i
think
minnesota,
your
honor,
is
the
first
state
where
we've
had
the
issue
up.
we've
had
many
decisions
in
the
federal
courts
where
the
labor
board
has
gone
in
for
what's
called
10(l)
injunctions,
which
decisions
unfortunately
not
reported
so
we
haven't
put
it
in
our
brief.
we've
had
about
four
or
five
of
those
in
which
labor
orders
held
that
we
are
a
labor
organization.
mr.
lee
pressman
pardon
me?
mr.
lee
pressman
no,
it
was
a
secondary
boycott,
same
issue,
secondary
boycott.
your
honor,
i
just
simply
say
in
conclusion,
and
i'm
trying
to
reserve
a
little
time
for
any
rebuttal
i
could
make
in
(inaudible),
said
i
submit,
this
is
the
very
situation
which
i
believe
was
at
the
heart
or
the
reason
for
the
doctrine
of
preemption.
here,
certainly
the
record
indicates
that
there
is
enough
of
a
situation
to
urge
that
reasonably
or
arguably
we
are
the
petitioner
or
petitioners
are
labor
organizations
falling
within
the
purview
of
section
8
(b).
and
it's
for
the
labor
board
therefore
to
have
the
primary
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
make
that
determination,
not
a
conflict
among
all
the
state
courts,
some
saying
“yes”,
some
saying
“no”
and
the
labor
board
saying
some
--
making
the
third
decision.
mr.
lee
pressman
no,
your
honor,
you
may
--
i'm
--
i'm
sure
you
misunderstood
me.
i
said
the
lower
court
made
no
such
finding.
what
the
lower
court
found
was
that
the
employees
of
this
primary
employer
were
supervisors.
that
was
the
only
finding
of
fact
on
that
issue.
the
only
thing
you
have
is
that
statement
--
is
a
conclusion
of
law
that
petitioners
is
not
a
labor
organization
within
the
purview
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
then
we
have
that
sentence
in
the
memorandum
of
law
which
i
read,
where
the
first
thing
--
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
says,
"nothing
in
the
record
as
to
any
non-supervisory
member."
and
then
the
rest
of
the
sentence
goes
on
to
say,
"almost
primarily"
but
does
not
say
that
the
membership
of
the
petitioners
is
exclusively
supervisors.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lee
pressman
none
your
honor.
mr.
lee
pressman
none.
mr.
lee
pressman
situations
will
vary
where
on
some
vessels
be
it
in
the
harbors
and
the
rivers
--
mr.
lee
pressman
--
where
our
marine
engineers
will
not
be
supervising
anybody
and
then
eliminates
them
as
--
from
the
status
of
being
supervisors.
mr.
lee
pressman
marine
engineers
in
other
situations
mostly
in
the
offshore
and
on
the
great
lakes
are
supervisors
because
customarily
they
have
non-supervisors
whom
they're
supervising.
mr.
lee
pressman
but
we
have
among
our
membership
as
to
graham
transportation
case
indicates.
we
have
among
our
membership
non-supervisors
because
the
labor
board
has
held
elections
for
them.
mr.
lee
pressman
this
is
on
the
harbor.
mr.
lee
pressman
on
the
great
lakes
--
mr.
lee
pressman
--
i
would
say
that
the
marine
engineers
on
the
great
lakes
have
primary
the
same
status
as
those
of
the
primary
employer
here,
the
respondent.
mr.
lee
pressman
your
honor,
we
take
in
none
but
marine
engineers.
mr.
lee
pressman
but
within
the
concept
of
marine
engineers.
most
of
them
are
supervisors
and
though
a
marine
engineer,
he
might
not
be
a
supervisor.
and
we
take
in
marine
engineers
only.
mr.
lee
pressman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
pressman
what
i've
just
said
applies
to
both
the
national
meba
and
local
101.
mr.
lee
pressman
that
we
can
or
cannot
(inaudible).
mr.
lee
pressman
no,
your
honor.
if
we
are
a
labor
organization,
we
fall
within
section
8
(b)
because
section
8
(b)
starts
out
by
saying
"it
shall
be
an
unfair
legal
practice
for
a
labor
organization
to
do
certain
things."
mr.
lee
pressman
now
--
mr.
lee
pressman
that
--
that
provision
we
would
not
violate.
mr.
lee
pressman
the
second
--
i
--
i
think
that
was
true,
your
honor.
i
think
the
secondary
boycott
provision
which
under
which
we
would
fall.
mr.
lee
pressman
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
just
two
or
three
very
brief
comments.
first,
the
case
we've
heard
to
by
counsel
for
the
respondents
in
re
kelleher
for
the
case
that
arose
that
has
--
i
believe
is
completely
in
apposite
in
the
sense,
it
did
not
in
anyway
raised
the
issue
of
preemption.
the
issue
came
up
under
a
state
statute
with
respect
to
certain
jurisdictional
disputes
between
various
unions
but
the
issue
of
preemption
is
not
involved
in
that
case.
number
two,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
local
101
to
which
references
has
been
made
is
not
confined
in
its
jurisdiction
to
the
great
lakes.
the
record
indicates
that
local
101
includes
areas
in
the
offshore
and
harbors
activities,
and
as
i
stated,
local
101
is
the
successive
union
to
the
union
involved
in
graham
transportation
case
where
an
election
was
held
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
therefore
indicating
they
do
have
members
who
are
employees.
counsel
for
the
respondents
has
pointed
to
finding
number
2
on
page
29
of
the
record
as
his
only
finding
with
respect
to
the
status
of
the
membership
of
the
meba.
i
indicate
and
wish
to
emphasize
that
that
finding
merely
says
that
the
defendant
local
101
admits
to
membership
license
marine
engineers.
there
is
no
statement
that
that
is
the
exclusive
membership
of
local
101.
and
may
i
point
out
that
the
other
petitioner
in
this
case
is
the
national
meba.
local
101
is
only
one
of
two
petitioners.
lastly,
i
wish
to
make
this
observation.
as
far
as
the
meba
is
concerned,
we
argued
strenuously
before
the
labor
board
and
may
i
say
to
the
chief
justice,
the
nlrb
did
hold
in
this
specific
case,
"we
were
a
labor
organization
because
we
had
a
few
members
of
the
word
non-supervisors."
you'll
find
the
actual
quotation
from
the
decision
of
the
nlrb
on
page
11
of
our
brief
where
the
board
says,
"we
conclude
that
some
of
the
engineers
whom
meba
admits
into
membership
are
not
supervisors,
and
therefore
that
meba
is
a
labor
organization
as
defined
in
the
act."
the
labor
board
so
held
and
that
was
the
case
that
judge
friendly
and
the
court
affirmed
in
the
case
which
we
have
cited.
i'd
make
this
last
observation.
there's
been
considerable
comment
--
mr.
lee
pressman
pardon
me?
mr.
lee
pressman
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
lee
pressman
it
has
not
repudiated.
mr.
lee
pressman
we
have
had
no
cases
that
have
come
up
since.
we've
accepted
that
that
could
be
the
law.
and
there'd
been
no
repudiation
whatsoever.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
has
been
another
case
of
the
nlrb
involving
the
masters,
mates
and
pilots,
an
organization
primarily
composed
of
supervisors
and
the
board
reaffirmed
their
decision
in
that
case.
mr.
lee
pressman
it's
cited
in
re
--
in
the
pos
--
respondent's
brief.
you'll
find
it
in
masters,
mates
and
pilots
versus
nlrb,
i
don't
have
the
precise
page
number.
but
may
i
make
my
--
a
final
comment.
before
the
labor
board,
the
national
meba
being
composed
primarily,
not
exclusively,
but
primarily
of
supervisors,
we
have
urged
that
since
our
members
by
and
large
do
not
get
the
protection
of
section
8
or
section
7.
we
should
not
be
brought
into
the
fold
of
the
act
under
section
8
(b).
we
argued
as
strenuously
as
it
could
possibly
have
been
done.
we
were
overruled,
we
maintained.
there
was
a
quid
pro
quo
for
one
for
the
other.
we
have
accepted
that
ruling
that
we
are
under
the
--
within
the
purview
of
section
8
(b).
that
is
precisely
what's
involved
in
this
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
