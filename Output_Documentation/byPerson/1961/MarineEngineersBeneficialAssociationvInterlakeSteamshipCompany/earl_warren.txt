there

is
the
relationship
of

do
you
point
out

that's
being
conclusive
against
the

the

position?
chief

chief
justice
earl
warren
what
were
the
deficiencies
in

cause
the

to
take
the
petition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
might
we
not
have
the
same
situation
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
--
because
of
a
failure
to
show
what
the
membership
consisted
of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
--
mr.
jackson,
may
i
ask
this.
has
the
board
itself
ever
taken
a
position
on
these
issues
in
any
of
these
cases
that
we've
been
talking
about?
