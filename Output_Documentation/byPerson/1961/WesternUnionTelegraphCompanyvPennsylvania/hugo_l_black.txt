justice
hugo
l.
black
you
made
one
statement
that
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understood,
maybe
i
understood
it
wrong.
did
you
say
that
one
state
is
bound
under
all
circumstances
to
be
entitled
to
all
these
funds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'm
not
take
--
talking
about
making
you
pay
it,
two
or
three
or
four
or
five,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that's
under
the
law,
one
state
is
entitled
in
every
dollar
of
this
fund,
one
or
another
state
is
entitled
to
every
dollar
of
this
fund.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
no
distinction
possibly
would
be
drawn
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
there's
a
state
that
doesn't
have
escheat
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
state
of
domicile
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
western
union's
supplies
so
far
as
i've
heard
from
you
so
far
is
that
one
question
that
might
be
understood
in
this
through
is
--
has
no
interest
dollar
can't
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
probably
belongs
to
somebody
else
and
you
say
that
the
--
maybe
it's
right
that
the
one
state
should
have
a
right
to
take
this
property
as
its
own.
it's
a
state
where
the
corporation
was
organized
that
which
corporation
has
no
possible
interest
by
itself
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
what
i
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
it
say
it's
fair
to
everyone?
you're
going
to
look
at
10
to
everyone
concerned.
say
that
the
state
which
happen
to
be
active
and
having
collaboration
to
organizing,
get
all
the
multistate
money
which
may
belong
or
have
belong
to
the
people
in
all
of
the
state
for
the
union.
how
could
just
say
that
you're
putting
it
all
simply
in
way
of
fairness,
that
that's
a
fair
way
to
provide
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
know
they're
working
out
well.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maine
--
maine
and
delaware,
maybe
new
jersey.
justice
hugo
l.
black
arizona
permitted?
i
didn't
know
if
they
did
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
become
a
recent
competitor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
presume
there's
one
basis
of
fairness
is
more
than
that.
the
word
“situs”
or
are
any
other
word
or
label,
that
is
whether
the
states
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
money
and
left
at
a
place
or
to
get
it
all
for
process
of
escheat
on
grounds
somehow
constitution
requires.
i'm
not
saying
we
don't
have
to
sit
and
do
that
but
i
do
not
see
how
anyone
could
appeal
on
the
basis
of
justice
in
that
regard.
they're
just
simple
elemental
as
--
as
we
think
about
of
justice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
ought
to
be
held
twice
in
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
i
think
is
also
an
element
of
fairness
that
you
should
not
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
arguments
could
be
made
against
that
--
to
take
the
new
york
life
insurance
company,
maybe
its
principal
office
is
in
new
york
but
its
policy
holders
are
in
every
state
in
the
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
well,
i'm
not
saying
they're
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
your
company's
interest
is
a
single
one,
while
you
have
had
added
it
there.
what
you
want
to
be
protected
as
i
understand
it,
is
having
to
pay
this
price
of
being
harassed
by
continuous
lawsuits
because
there's
no
way
for
nobody
to
know
who
gets
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
no
other
interest,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
we
didn't
want
to
hold
at
new
york
got
a
windfall.
then
what's
your
suggestion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
own
it
yet.
it
hold
it
in
custody
for
people
owned
it.
you
own
it
in
various
parts
of
the
union
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
we
didn't
want
to
hold
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
corporation,
did
you
get
it
or
are
they
supposed
to
be
centralizing
it
at
certain
states,
or
the
status
of
doing
business,
then
what's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
second
suggestion.
i
don't
understand
why
western
union
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
has
a
choice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
to
be
relieved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
yet
to
mention
the
people
who
own
the
money,
either
those
who
paid
it
in
or
those
to
whom
it
could
have
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
none
of
the
couriers
at
that
time
had
been
or
have
known,
did
they,
any
right
of
owning
in
a
single
slight
right
of
ownership
to
that
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
none
of
the
couriers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
temporary
but
that
the
--
it
was
the
people
who
would
get
the
money
and
not
the
people
who
would
carry
into
holding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
in
the
proposals
so
far
as
you
know,
that
congress
by
its
power,
under
the
commerce
clause
or
any
clause
to
enact
some
legislation
to
prevent
confusion
as
a
result
of
the
claims
of
the
various
states
to
escheat?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
of
prior
procedure,
that's
putting
a
greater
emphasis
on
who
gets
there
first.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
there
has
been
a
bunch
of
good
activity
in
the
last
few
years
in
the
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
some
of
it
in
one
of
his
previous
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
may
not
be
unseemly
but
despite
of
dispute
between
you
and
new
york
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
new
york
is
here
raising
questions.
we've
permitted
new
york
to
argue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
the
state
who
are
headed
to
an
escheat
would
never
get
together
in
the
way
and
that
the
congress
passed
the
law,
i
don't
know
what
it
could
or
not,
i'm
not
saying.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
former
case
as
all
of
them
have
pointed
in
one
opinion
or
another,
the
difficulties
of
reaching
the
decision,
the
decision
have
been
better
now,
haven't
you?
all
the
time
there's
someone
pointing
out
that
--
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out
here
and
the
other
members
of
the
court,
that
there
may
be
other
claimants
who
have
a
pretty
considerable
right
to
some
of
these
funds.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
we're
confronted
with
this
contest
that
vague
between
you
and
new
york
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
the
other
states
may
find
out
their
responsibilities
that
i
have
no
doubt
the
courts
will
have
far
better
more
contest
than
your
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
your
argument.
it
means
and
probably
should
that
if
you
do
when
new
york's
law
and
any
other
states
barred
you
from
asking
from
presenting
your
claims.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
adjust
funds.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
it
gives
one
state
which
the
power
to
determine
as
you
say
in
the
lawsuit
of
its
own
in
its
own
state
to
make
a
final
determination
of
who's
entitled
to
funds
that
maybe
the
40
states
has
potential
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
put
in
the
briefs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
standard
oil
case
though
several
opinion.
two
of
the
opinion
indicated
that
wholly
found
this
position
was
made
to
his
four
members
agreeing
for
any
final
disposition
that's
made,
all
the
states
should
be
heard
about.
it
might
have
an
interest
nor
to
state
of
pennsylvania.
one
suggested
--
one
opinion
indicated
that
the
proper
place
indicated,
the
proper
place
to
do
that
might
be
in
our
courts.
the
other
one
didn't
indicate
at
all.
assuming
that
it
should
be
found
necessary
of
some
kind
that
in
order
to
name
that
final
adjudication
the
evident
adjudicated
that
all
the
claimants
could
be
present.
would
you
say
that
pennsylvania
would've
been
a
good
--
its
court
would
have
been
an
appropriate
place
for
this
instance
to
have
that
adjudicated
in
the
other
state?they
would
then
have
no
power
to
bring
them
here,
wouldn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
says
that
this
court
--
of
course
we
have
said
that
in
some
instances
a
matter
of
that
between
states
that
you
began
in
the
district
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
say
the
way
we
can
dispose
of
this
particular
judgment
that
either
holding
absolutely
that
you're
entitled
to
in
new
york
or
not.
a
holding
that
new
york
is
more
entitled
than
you
are
holding
against
you
and
then
leaving
it
to
be
decided
hereafter,
what
have
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
argument
would
rule
new
york
out
completely,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
by
not
claiming
there
yet?
