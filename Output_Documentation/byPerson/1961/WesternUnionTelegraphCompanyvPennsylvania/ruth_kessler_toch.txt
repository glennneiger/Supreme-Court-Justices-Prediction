ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
new
york
has
filed
here
as
amicus
curiae
in
the
court
being
given
permission
to
argue.
as
amicus
curiae
asking
that
the
court
not
decide
this
appeal
on
consideration
only
of
pennsylvania's
contention
that
it
has
jurisdiction
of
these
obligations
by
virtue
of
the
amenability
to
process
of
western
union,
48
states,
at
least,
united
states
can
make
that
statement.
nor
on
consideration
only
of
the
single
contact
that
pennsylvania
has
with
these
transactions.
now,
whether
we
say
situs
in
the
traditional
way
or
contact
as
that
term
has
been
used
in
the
fairly
recent
escheat
case
in
decisions,
opinions
by
this
court.
now,
i
should
say
that
in
all
escheat
cases,
the
holder
has
no
interest.
it
is
the
key,
is
or
it
is
the
holder,
banks,
life
insurance
and
so
on.
the
interest
is
by
the
owner
who
is
unknown
or
cannot
be
found.
now,
we
ask
the
court
that
if
you
--
the
whole
of
this
transactions,
the
kind
of
transactions
these
are,
with
virtually
every
one
of
them
passing
through
several
states
and
to
evaluate
pennsylvania's
claim
in
that
plight.
now,
we
ask
the
court
to
evaluate
the
claim
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
in
this
case
is
the
state
of
incorporation
and
the
state
where
the
principal
office
of
the
obligor
is
located
and
where
the
obligation
is
--
ultimately
has
its
place
as
mr.
buchanan
has
described
it.
now,
obviously,
in
these
multistate
transactions,
western
union
having
its
offices
and
thousands
of
offices
in
the
48
states,
in
other
words,
not
just
one
office
but
thousands
of
them,
it
would
be
difficult
of
course,
to
bring
all
of
the
states
that
could
possibly
have
a
claim
before
the
court.
we
submit
that
pennsylvania
in
this
case
is
representative
of
all
the
other
states
which
have
some
contact
with
these
transactions
as
contrasted
with
new
york
state
in
this
case
because
the
step
that
may
take
place
in
anyone
of
these
several
states
is
no
more
essential
in
the
transactions
than
the
step
which
may
take
place
in
another
state.
and
accordingly,
the
contact
again
of
anyone
said
state
would
not
be
greater
than
a
contact
of
another.
this
would
include
pennsylvania
and
perhaps
pennsylvania's
claim
is
a
great
and
its
contact
is
a
great
deal
less
than
that
of,
for
example,
the
state
where
the
sendee
has
been
or
where
he
is
resident.
and
so
we
asked
the
court
to
weigh
as
alternative
to
the
number
of
states
with
minor
and
equal
in
value
and
degree,
at
the
most,
the
ultimate
and
essential
contacts
of
the
principal
office
of
western
union
with
the
transactions
and
therefore,
of
the
state
of
the
principal
office
of
western
union,
new
york
state.
now,
pennsylvania,
in
its
brief,
has
sent
that
new
york's
position
in
this
case
is
and
in
its
statutes
is
different
from
the
position
we
took
in
the
connecticut
mutual
case.
and
perhaps
in
my
comment
on
that,
i
will
also
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
of
where
connecticut
mutual
and
standard
oil
leaves
us
or
states
which
are
before
the
court
on
the
question
of
escheat.
i
think
our
position
is
in
harmony
with
the
position
we
took
in
western
--
in
connecticut
mutual
and
also
that
where
those
cases
leave
us
is
that
the
factors
in
one
kind
of
transaction
point
to
one
state
as
having
the
jurisdiction,
the
dominant
contacts
and
in
another
transaction,
another
kind
of
transaction
that
another
state
has
it.
now,
in
the
standard
oil
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
think
we're
talking
about
the
contacts
with
the
obligation.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
in
escheat,
as
i
said,
the
money
is
taken
by
the
state
from
the
holder
of
it.
that
is
where
it
is,
it's
the
holder
of
it.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
except
that
eventually
it
--
they
don't
hold
it
in
pennsylvania,
they
don't
hold
it
in
pennsylvania.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that
is
quite
right.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no,
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice,
it
was
not
paid
out
in
pennsylvania
and
it
wasn't
supposed
to
be
paid
out
in
pennsylvania
except
in
the
--
in
a
small
proportion
of
the
cases.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
but
very
few.
i
mean
--
may
say
this,
certainly,
so
few
that
we
can't
say
that,
that
was
the
type
of
transaction
it
was
and
that's
where
the
money
was.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
i
am.
i
think
i
am
on
a
matter
of
law
and
i
think
that
each
one
of
these
cases,
the
rule
of
law
is
developed
because
of
the
kind
of
transaction
it
is.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
may
i
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that's
right.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that's
right.
i
should
state
that
that
was
that
--
perhaps
mr.
buchanan
can
answer
a
little
more
definitely
on
that
one,
he
has
his
five
minute
because
i
didn't
study
it
but
i
should
also
say
two
things,
that
--
notices
would
have
to
go
from
pennsylvania
also
to
the
payees
--
the
sendees
all
over
the
united
states
and
moreover,
new
york
a
custodial
statute
so
that
at
any
time
when
the
sendee
discovers
at
any
time
that
this
money
has
gone
to
the
state
of
new
york,
always
comes
to
the
state
of
new
york
to
control
and
gives
them
the
money
and
that
is
the
daily
practice.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
custodial
statute.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that
may
there
well
but
i
think
that
the
notices
still
could,
whatever
notice
is
affective
whether
it's
personal
or
publication,
would
be
effective
whether
it
was
in
pennsylvania
or
was
outside
because
the
sendees,
that's
exactly
why
we're
saying
in
this
case
and
of
the
most
of
sendees
are
spread
all
over
the
united
states.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
couldn't
tell
you.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
it's
substantial
but
as
i
say
they
are
always
ready
and
they
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
couldn't
tell
you
and
as
i
said,
if
the
court
wants
to
know,
i
can
find
out
and
send
you
our
comptroller
reports.
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
left,
i
think
that
the
--
we
took
the
position
in
connecticut
mutual
and
the
brief
is
on
file
in
this
court.
we
said
that
new
york
there
seeks
only
policies
written
by
the
branches
of
the
foreign
companies
on
new
york
ensures
and
delivered
in
new
york.
and
that
is
the
core
of
the
court's
holding;
it
is
the
domiciliary
tie,
the
tie
of
residence.
now,
those
where
the
essential
factors
in
this
insurance
policies,
so
that
the
prinicipal
office
aspect
of
it
was
subordinate.
but
in
this
case,
pennsylvania
does
not
rely
on
residence
of
any
one.
they
don't
know
the
residence
of
the
sendees,
they
don't
know
the
residence
of
the
senders
and
certainly
western
union
is
not
a
resident.
and
new
york
state,
the
only
domicile
that
we
know,
both
by
registration
and
by
the
principal
office
is
in
new
york
state.
now,
as
to
life
insurance
since
then,
we
have
these
giant
insurance
companies
in
new
york
state,
metropolitan
new
york
by
this
showing.but
we
only
escheat
the
unclaimed
funds
on
policy
written
in
new
york,
delivered
new
york
and
the
lives
of
new
york
residents
by
our
own
domestic
insurance
companies.
their
branches
outside
new
york
in
pennsylvania,
anywhere,
we
do
not
touch
them.
and
finally
as
far
as
our
legislation
is
concerned,
in
1953
we
added
in
the
--
as
subject
to
escheat
to
our
statute
section
501
involving
securities.
and
there,
we
said,
that
we
take
only
the
unclaimed
securities
of
domestic
corporations
owed
to
residents
of
new
york
state.
so
i
think
that
our
position
is
consistent,
i
think
that
our
position
is
rather
temperate,
it
is
a
custodial
statute
and
so
we
ask
that
for
these
transactions
is
to
court
reverse
pennsylvania,
reject
pennsylvania's
claim
and
approve
new
york's
claim.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
--
i
think
without
giving
it
a
thought
that
i
would
say
the
principal
place
of
business
and
none
of
which
is
domesticated.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
but
i
still
say
is
the
site
of
obligation,
yes.
where
the
company
merely
registers
outside
that
state
but
has
its
place
of
business
--
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
took
the
position
in
our
brief
in
connecticut
mutual
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
foreign
insurance
company
has
been
authorized
to
do
business
in
new
york
state,
it
wasn't
doing
business
in
new
york
state,
we
were
not
claiming
policies
written
by
that
company.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
think
we're
dealing
there
with
securities
which
have
their
situs,
i
think,
going
way
back
and
the
home
of
the
company
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
know
and
i
have
tried
to
utilize
that
case
and
bring
it's
harmony
with
our
position.
but
the
only
thing
that
i
can
ascribe
to
as
the
basis
of
that
holding
is
the
old
traditional
theory
that
the
stocks
of
a
corporation
have
their
base
in
the
state
where
the
core
--
companies
incorporated.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
know.
well,
in
this
case,
of
course,
we
don't
have
the
problem.
