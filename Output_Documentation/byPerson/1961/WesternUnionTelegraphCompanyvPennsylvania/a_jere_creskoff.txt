mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
i
will
first
endeavored
to
answer
mrs.
toch
because
she
spoke
last
and
that
is
always
most
clearly
in
mind.
i
have
no
objection
to
the
fact
but
the
fact
is
that
in
filing
its
petition
before
this
court,
the
state
of
new
york
seemed
to
rest
its
application
on
the
question
of
the
domicile
of
the
corporation,
the
respondent
in
this
case.
however,
the
brief
filed
by
the
state
of
new
york
seems
to
depart
from
that
position
and
argues
rather
on
contacts.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
contents
of
the
brief,
new
york
leans
over
toward
the
position
taken
by
pennsylvania
and
depends
on
contacts
rather
than
the
mere
fact
of
domicile
of
the
corporation.
now,
this
of
course
must
necessarily
be
so
because
in
the
sense,
it
was
new
york
in
the
decision
of
its
appellate
court
by
its
legislature
on
the
decision
in
connecticut
life
versus
moore
in
297
new
york,
that
got
away
from
the
question
of
the
domicile
of
better
corporation
and
rest
it
in
a
contacts,
the
so-called
superior
contacts
that
new
york
had
with
the
insurance
policy
stoned
by
foreign
insurance
companies,
domesticated
in
new
york
and
so
to
residents
of
new
york.
it's
true
that
when
that
case
reached
this
court,
this
court
modified
the
cases
of
escheat
or
to
taking
under
its
custodial
law
various
classes
of
policies
that
might
have
troubled
this
court
such
as
the
residence
of
the
beneficiary
and
other
factors
that
were
then
involved
but
it
was
new
york
itself
that
in
that
series
of
cases
departed
from
the
principle
that
is
a
insignificant
fact
that
a
corporation
has
its
domicile
in
one
place
or
another.
now,
this
business
we've
heard
about
the
unseemly
raise
of
the
states
for
the
escheat
of
funds,
just
isn't
held
up
by
the
facts.
it
so
happens
when
my
hair
was
a
lot
darker
even
then
day,
i
argued
the
original
client
case
in
this
court
way
back
in
the
303
u.s.
20
some
years
have
passed
from
that
day
and
i
leave
it
to
this
court
to
answer
for
itself
how
many
us
chief
cases
have
reached
this
court
in
those
20
some
years.
obviously,
very
few
and
obviously
always
when
someone
thought
that
there
was
a
special
point
involved
that
hadn't
been
decided.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
no
i
wouldn't
come
go
completely
that
far
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
has
been
raised
in
this
case
by
the
appellant,
the
question
of
this
threats
that
were
issued.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
controlled
this
court's
decision
to
know
its
probable
jurisdiction
in
this
case
but
we
have
in
our
discussions
in
pennsylvania
assumed
it
was
that
new
element
of
the
graft.
although
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
do
indeed.
i
think
in
the
case
of
standard
oil
and
new
jersey
and
in
the
connecticut
and
moore
cases,
there
is
sufficient
law
without
further
for
this
court
to
recognize
the
degree
of
the
pennsylvania
court
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
not
in
the
connecticut
case,
there
was
emphasis
of
it
but
the
court
departed
from
the
significance
domicile.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
it
talked
about
substantial
contacts
and
in
my
opinion,
may
i
say
that
there
was
a
lot
to
the
theory
of
substantial
contacts
and
when
we
examined
what
contacts
we
are
talking
about
as
the
chief
justice
started
to
inquire,
we
can
perhaps
clarify
just
what
the
substantial
contacts
is
and
what
the
affirmable
contacts
are
that
other
states
might
touch
upon
a
fund
and
then
this
point
let
me
say
that
i
can't
conceive
of
any
single
escheat
situation
where
any
of
that
more
than
two
states
can
possibly
be
involved
and
probably
when
a
situation
is
analyzed
in
each
particular
case
just
one
state
is
surely
involved.
now,
i
wonder
if
it
was
made
clear
to
the
court
in
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
i
know
there
was
no
one
intention
not
to
make
it
clear
but
i
want
to
leave
it
crystalline
clear
that
not
one
cent
of
the
funds
covered
by
the
pennsylvania
escheat
decree
have
been
the
subject
of
the
claim
of
any
of
state
including
new
york.
now
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
think
not
for
the
following
reasons
because
i
think
that
what
we're
talking
about
here,
the
most
substantial
contact
of
all
can
only
be
in
the
state
where
the
raise,
when
the
obligation
was
created,
now
i
can
conceive
of
the
shifting
locale
of
that
obligation
once
created
and
that
obligation
that's
being
escheated
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
no
i
said
when
you
judge
this
substantiality
of
contacts
that
give
a
state
and
perhaps
the
only
other
state
a
right
to
proceed.
that
is
a
very
substantial
contact,
now
let
me
answer
something
on
the
question
of
these
drafts
and
these
payees.
that
very
question
was
before
the
new
jersey
court
of
the
standard
oil
case.
it's
true
that
the
same
question
was
not
pressed
when
that
case
reached
this
court
but
if
the
court
will
keep
in
mind
that
mr.
buchanan
agree
that
another
name
for
these
drafts
we
talked
about
is
checks
and
that
checks
in
payment
of
dividends
that's
been
issued
in
the
thousands
and
that
that
question
was
disposed
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
the
standard
oil
case,
those
checks
too
might
have
been
negotiated;
those
checks
to
may
have
found
their
place
in
the
hands
of
citizens
or
residents
in
other
states
or
other
foreign
countries.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
no
as
i
recall
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
that
situation,
those
checks
were
drawn
on
banks
in
new
york.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
drawn
by
and
on
the
banks
in
new
york
that
were
the
special
depository
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
--
for
the
payment
of
dividends
that
special
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
but
let
me
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
let
me
follow
up
your
question
there
a
bit,
in
another
direction,
mr.
justice
brennan.
these
drafts,
we
must
remember,
are
issued
--
we're
issued
no
less
than
15
years
to
go
in
any
instance
and
in
some
instances
30
years
ago,
as
assumed
by
exhibit
a
in
the
record
page
59,
where
there's
a
representative
list,
of
this
type
of
graft.
only
one
item
is
for
a
hundred
dollars
and
the
rest
are
for
$1
to
$15
dollar
maximum.
we
understand
that
that
is
represented
those
20
items
are
represented
above
the
situation.
now,
you've
have
heard
they
might
not
be
a
majority
of
cases
but
many
of
these
drafts
were
issued
intrastate.
the
sender
was
in
pennsylvania,
the
recipient
was
in
pennsylvania.
the
whereabouts
of
neither
is
known,
no
claims
has
been
made.
now
what
about
these
drafts,
isn't
it
interesting
that
the
respondent
himself
in
his
answer
in
the
state
court
in
pennsylvania,
pleaded
that
the
pennsylvania
stature
of
limitations
has
deprived
to
all
of
these
drafts
and
there
was
no
further
liability.
now,
in
this
situation
we
are
much
of
the
fears
of
dual
liability,
triple
liability,
quintuple
liability
but
in
fact,
this
respondent
while
it
didn't
pass
in
the
appellate
court,
did
plead
at
the
pennsylvania
statute
of
limitations
was
a
bar
to
all
of
the
drafts,
and
i
think
any
liability
to
run
wherever
held.
now,
going
to
the
question
or
fear
of
liability
over
and
over
again,
that
certainly
wouldn't
be
true.
that
the
respondent
has
any
fear
on
that
score
at
all
because
himself,
has
categorically
pleaded
that
these
obligations
are
all
dated.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
may
i
try
to
answer
that
this
way.
we
assume
that
in
the
ultimate
sense,
it
was
the
duty
of
the
respondent
to
refund
the
price
deposited
or
the
amount
deposited
with
western
union
to
be
sent
in
the
event
that
they
could
not
deliver
that
month.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
no,
that's
--
i'm
in
agreement
with
that
generally
but
perhaps,
this
more
approaches
our
are
reasoning
in
answer
to
your
question.
we
must
remember
that
there
was
no
agreement
here
or
whatsoever
between
the
sender
and
western
union
to
issue
any
draft
at
all.
all
the
record
discloses
and
all
of
the
instances,
all
that
happened
was,
western
union
gave
a
receipt
to
the
sender
saying,
we
will
send
so
much
money
to
the
sendee.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
the
sender
is
bound,
nor
anyone
is
bound
unless
under
the
pennsylvania
law,
there's
a
specific
agreement
that
the
issuance
of
a
draft
is
in
fact
payment
and
of
course
the
draft
is
evidence
of
the
obligation.
but
the
original
obligation
is
that
which
the
draft
is
built
around,
now
even
in
notifying
the
pay
where
western
union
said
we
have
received
a
sum
of
money
for
you.
it's
true
that
western
union
for
its
convenience
or
that
of
the
payee
might
not
pay
the
dollars
over
the
counter
but
issue
a
draft,
but
that's
something
that
was
never
within
the
agreement
between
the
sender
and
western
union.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
in
the
course
business.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
no
sir.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
the
very
--
the
record
will
show
that
these
are
exhibits
of
the
respondent
that
is
was
a
matter
of
convenience
whether
in
a
given
case,
either
making
refund
to
the
sender
or
giving
the
money
to
the
payee
whether
a
draft
was
or
was
not
issued
was
a
pure
matter
of
convenience,
to
one
or
the
other
of
a
party,
now
in
any
case,
the
sender
could
come
in,
and
walk
out
with
the
cash
if
that's
what
he
prefer.
if
he
didn't
want
to
carry
the
cash,
he
might
say
i
will
take
a
draft
in
which
case,
they
gave
him
a
draft.
sometimes
western
union
would
know
the
payee
and
would
mail
a
draft
or
deliver
it
by
messenger
and
would
do
so
apparently
without
asking
the
sendee
which
form
he
wanted
the
transmittal
but
would
do
so
as
a
matter
of
convenience
to
itself
and
the
draft.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
he
may
on
certain
cases
where
not
these
drafts
are
dated
(voice
overlap)
where
not
the
statute
of
limitations
available
as
a
defense.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
well
i
remember
this
too
about
that
draft
we're
talking
about
that
it
wasn't
an
unconditional
draft
in
every
case,
it
was
a
draft
that
have
to
be
accepted
at
the
bank
in
which
drawn.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
it's
not
the
identification
of
the
end
of
the
sendee,
i'm
talking
when
it
reaches
the
bank
on
which
it's
withdrawn,
the
draft
have
to
be
accepted.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
think,
that
minnesota
would
be
bound
in
that
case
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
that
that
finally
adjudicated
here.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
oh
yes.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
would
the
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
would
think
not
sir.
i
would
think
that
the
claimant
of
minnesota
in
that
case
would
have
to
be
freshly
examined
and
that
it
may
turn
out
because
of
the
facts
in
that
case
to
be
superior
than
any
claim
that
pennsylvania
might
assert.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
well,
i
have
never
argued
that
one
state
of
necessity
because
it's
a
state
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
no,
i
do
not
at
all
attach
any
importance
that
time
and
may
i
say
upon.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
well
i
--
i
would
say,
i
would
like
to
know
first
what
minnesota
was
asserting
as
it
rights
to
the
fund
as
compared
to
what
pennsylvania
on
that
hypothetical
case
was
saying
its
rights
were
into
those
specific
funds.
now
pennsylvania
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
would
say
i
would
like
to
examine
all
of
those
facts
and
to
show
that
that's
a
consistent
position,
may
i
say
that
pennsylvania
has
very
scrupulously
avoided
attempting
to
include
as
escheatable
property
any
moneys
that
other
residence
of
the
other
48
states
may
have
sent
or
residents
in
pennsylvania
under
similar
circumstances.
pennsylvania
does
not
regard
that
as
escheatable
property
within
pennsylvania,
even
though
the
sendees
may
have
been
in
pennsylvania
because
to
be
consistent,
the
concept
of
pennsylvania
is
that
the
closeness
of
the
contact
to
the
core
of
the
transaction,
the
obligation
if
there's
to
be
some
order
“must
reside
in
the
state”
where
the
fund,
where
the
obligation
is
originated
because
the
sender's
sent
the
fund
from
that
and
was
presumably
a
resident
of
that
state.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
think
that's
the
ultimate
question.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
no,
i
want
the
personal
service
was
on
the
debtor.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
our
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
--
position
is
that
the
obligation
created
at
the
time
of
the
sending
was
the
raise
that
is
here
attached
the
obligation
of
western
union.
our
position
right
or
wrong
is
that
the
locale
of
that
obligation
cannot
shift
by
the
mere
issuance
of
these
drafts
which
are
now
stale-dated,
a
term
used
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
and
that
pennsylvania
had
jurisdiction
over
the
rights,
notice
it
was
proper,
it
was
affirmed
on
appealed
and
as
far
as
pennsylvania's
concerned
unless
this
court
finds
that
an
error
was
committed.
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
third
step
where
the
full
faith
and
credit
will
be
given
by
new
york.
they
have
given
heretofore,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
during
the
whole
tendency
of
this
case,
the
pennsylvania
case
we're
here
talking
about
and
new
york
abandoned
property
laws
specifically
exempted
any
situation
in
which
another
court
and
another
state
have
first
taken
jurisdiction.
now,
it's
true
in
1960,
after
the
decree
was
injured
in
this
case,
new
york
amended
its
abandoned
property
law
and
left
out
that
provision
and
i'm
saying
during
the
entire
period,
the
inception
of
the
action
to
the
procurement
of
the
decree,
new
york
recognized
that
many
field
with
another
state
had
proceeded
to
the
escheat
of
the
fund,
it
would
hold
hands
off
until
the
determination
of
that
case
and
your
honor
needs
determine.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
when
one
raises
the
obligation
by
western
union.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
pennsylvania
has
seized
that
raise.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
by
the
service
of
the
process
by
the
service
of
the
complaint
of
escheat
by
this
complainant.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
actually
a
certified
copy
of
the
petition
escheat.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
no
because
as
far
as
pennsylvania
is
concerned,
it
has
jurisdiction
over
western
union,
western
union
is
operated
in
pennsylvania
through
hundreds
of
offices
for
many
years.
it
enjoys
the
protection
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania
in
the
same
sense
as
was
set
in
the
connecticut-moore
case.
it
has
pleaded
in
the
courts
of
pennsylvania
that
submitted
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
but
not
on
these
funds,
your
honor.
it
may
submit
itself
in
missouri
as
to
different
raise
but
it
hasn't
as
to
this
raise
from
our
viewpoint.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
it
has
been
so
indicated
here
but
i
don't
think
you
can.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
don't
think
it
can.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
we
take
that
position
right
or
wrong.when
you
think
it's
right,
but
whether
be
right
or
wrong,
that's
our
position,
that
the
raise
does
not
float
around,
the
obligation
does
not
float
around.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
don't
think
that
--
i've
never
heard
of
such
a
proposal.
i
don't
know
whether
congress
would
interest
itself
because
the
confusion
and
the
size
of
the
whole
field
is
sometimes
greatly
exaggerated.
i
don't
think
any
confusion
exist,
i
don't
think
any
chaos
exist,
i
don't
know
of
any
other
state
that
ever
at
the
same
time
has
laid
a
claim
to
a
fund
that
another
competent
court
in
a
different
state
had
under
its
control
because
of
prior
start
of
procedure.
now
we
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
no,
because
the
case
was
depending,
because
it's
recognize
that
ones
a
competent
court
has
taken
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
properly
or
coordinate
courts
will
recognize
that
jurisdiction,
recognize
that
possession
and
to
waive
the
orderly
disposition
of
that
case.
there
just
have
been
none
of
these
raises
we
talk
about.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
not
that
i
am
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
there's
been
a
little
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
well,
since
that
opinion
was
retained
have
we
heard,
of
any
unseemly
raises
between
the
states
and
the
unseemly
litigation
between
states.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
there
is
no
despute
in
the
sense
that
new
york
is
a
party
here.
new
york
is
simply
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
well,
i
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
they
might,
it
just
so
happens
i'm
not
in
their
company.
that
they
might
consider
it,
i
just
don't
know
one
way
or
the
other.
but
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
well
it's
always
appeared
to
me
that
others
have
been
more
concerned
upon
that
about
the
possible
existence
of
other
claimants
than
the
immediate
parties
have
ever
been.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
well
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
yes,
i
agree
with
that
your
honor,
this
is
wrong
as
far
as
the
law
goes
a
new
field.
i
don't
think
the
field
is
as
unlimited
as
some
people
suspect.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
our
essential
position
in
the
situation
is
of
course
this,
that
pennsylvania
have
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
that
the
raise
as
we
see
it
was
seized,
that
the
case
proceeded
to
unnoticed
to
hearing
that
the
lower
court
adjudicated
the
case,
that
exceptions
were
heard.
exceptions
disposed
of
then
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
all
of
the
arguments
you
heard
here
today
and
more
are
heard
and
carefully
considered
by
the
supreme
court.
and
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
and
interpreted
the
state
statutes
involving
the
part
of
drafts
and
the
dates
under
those
drafts,
and
the
staleness
of
drafts
that
we
heard
about
today.
i
necessarily
think
that
the
decree
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
opinion
by
that
court
in
this
case
is
where
they
have
a
lot
of
weight
because
it
considered
all
of
these
questions.
and
insofar
as
it
determined
the
interpretation
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
on
notice
and
the
pennsylvania
statues
on
the
drafts
concerning
a
question
whether
they're
payment
or
not
or
just
an
evidence
of
the
obligation
deserve
a
great
deal
of
weight
from
this
court
and
i'm
certain
that
they
will
get
a
great
deal
of
weight.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
as
to
any
of
these
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
--
these
funds.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
except
your
honor
that
we
don't
conceive
that
any
single
fund
can
there
be
40
states
in
having
the
potential
claim
or
that's
the
question
of
domicile
is
eliminated
more
than
one
fact
as
to
a
specific
fund
as
to
a
specific
single
item
we're
talking
about.
let's
assume
that
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
hypothetical
$25
transaction
that
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to.
if
we
narrow
it
down
that
way.
i
can't
see
that
any
court
will
ever
find
that
more
than
one
state
is
entitled
to
escheat
of
that
$25.
once
it
eliminates
the
question
of
the
easy
solution,
let's
give
it
to
the
state
of
incorporation
of
domicile.
other
than
that,
i
can't
see
any
two
states.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
maybe
but
not
in
particular
case
with
those
particular
fact
shown
that
missouri
would
prevail.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
but
then
we
say
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
no.
i
think
missouri
have
succeeded
in
that
case.
and
that
still
be
one
state
that
could
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
well,
it
couldn't
under
this
decree
but
i
think
that
it's
only
fair
to
assume
that
there
are
many
situation
of
hardship
as
the
cases
have
shown.
these
funds
can't
be
held
in
a
vacuum
forever
because
somebody
may
be
affected
by
the
notice
of
a
procedure
itself;
that
happens
every
day.
you
try
to
do
substantial
justice.
you
try
to
do
--
to
give
notice
that's
fair
under
all
circumstances
considering
the
nature
of
the
case,
your
international
or
your
malignant
cases
said
that
very
specifically
on
the
question
of
certainly
somebody
may
be
hurt.
your
international
shoe
case
much
more
substantial
interest
wherein
dispose
off.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
if
it
proceed
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
well,
let
me
point
out
as
far
as
pennsylvania's
concerned
of
escheat
statute
still
provide
a
term
of
years
and
which
then
a
proper
person,
that
could
include
that
term
could
include
another
state,
could
include
anybody
that
might
come
in
and
recover
the
fund
that
had
showed
superior
title.
there's
nothing
that
bars
any
state
i'm
coming
in
for
period
of
three
years
after
the
final
decree
escheat
in
pennsylvania.
now,
in
new
york
under
this
custodial
statute,
i
must
differ
although
it
may
seem
a
matter
of
temerity
with
mrs.
toch
here
from
what
that
statute
provides
that
statute
is
a
mixed
mini
escheat
statute
to
new
york
statute.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
mixed.
some
cases
are
mini
escheat
and
some
cases
custodial.
i
say,
if
we
assume
that
these
drafts
are
separate
obligations
under
the
new
york
statute,
you
must
come
in
within
five
years.
or
you
forever
lost
your
chance
for
a
refund.
now
the
five
years
differs
from
the
pennsylvania
three
years
that
who
is
there
to
say
which
is
the
wiser
period
by
which
they
--
more
generous
or
one
must
can
go
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
don't
know,
that's
not
in
the
position.
i
don't
think
it
was
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
--
ever
attacked.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i'm
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
you
would
have
this
x
states
but
i
still
point
out
that
each
state
if
it
were
entitled
under
this
theory
would
not
be
proceeding
for
the
same
transaction,
for
the
same
dollar
that
was
sent.
in
that
sense,
there
would
be
no
conflict
between
any
of
the
states.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
am
offering
that,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
do
believe
that
if
ever
there
was
such
a
rule
or
an
act
of
congress
that
some
special
forum
would
probably
be
designated
for
the
disposition
of
such
cases.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
well
i
know
further.
i
contemplate
that
in
these
cases,
the
dispute
might
sometimes
involve
others
than
just
states
and
might
be
as
to
particular
fund
of
individuals
involved,
there
are
payees.
so
when
i
said
a
different
forum,
i
meant
that
there
were
any
applicants
for
part
of
the
funds
involved
other
than
the
state.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
would
have
no
difficulty
at
all
with
the
proposition
that
this
court
can
properly
affirm
the
pennsylvania
decree.
i
think
when
the
briefs
are
studied,
some
of
the
other
problems
raised
here
today
by
some
of
the
questions
of
the
justices
perhaps
offer
some
more
problem
than
does
that
question.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
would
rule
them
out
because
your
honor
i
think
they
have
ruled
themselves
out.
i
think
they've
ruled
themselves
out
by
their
own
statute.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
no
sir,
because
they
specifically
accepted
cases
in
which
other
states
were
already
proceeding.
i
think
they've
ruled
it
out
by
their
own
position
in
connecticut
versus
moore
case.
may
i
go
back
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
your
question
which
you
said
i
have
no
intention
of
helping
you
and
which
i
did
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
that
--
and
this
court
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
this
court
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
this
thought
occurs
to
me
beyond
the
portend
of
your
question
sir
that
perhaps
pennsylvanians
would
benefit
more
than
his
--
than
we're
aware
of
if
the
rule
or
the
other
way
because
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
number
of
sendees
in
pennsylvania
if
that
were
--
those
funds
were
regard
as
escheatable
in
pennsylvania
would
exceed
by
far
the
funds
that
are
escheatable
under
this
decree
because
the
funds
were
originated
and
that
sent
out
from
pennsylvania.
i'm
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
--
certain
--
that
moving
the
other
way,
pennsylvania
was
the
proper
forum.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
pennsylvania
was
the
sendee's
state.
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i
think
because
more
money
is
sent
in
to
pennsylvania
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
jere
creskoff
i'm
not
aware
of
that
part,
your
honor.
