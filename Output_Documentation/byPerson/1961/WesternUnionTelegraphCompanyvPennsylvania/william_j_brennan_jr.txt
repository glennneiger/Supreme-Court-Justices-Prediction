justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
buchanan,
analytically,
what's
the
relationship
between
western
union
and
these
deposits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--
it
was
a
property,
it's
a
debt
owing
by
western
union
to
somebody?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
somebody
--
to
somebody
is
the
depositor
as
creditor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
as
depositor,
the
fellow
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
who
buys
--
gives
you
the
money
and
gets
his
draft.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
--
or
is
this
a
combination?
as
i
understand
it,
if
i
go
to
into
a
western
union
office
in
pennsylvania
and
i
ask
you
to
send
my
son
at
college
$25,
but
that's
too
low,
but
if
i
do,
there's
a
relationship
established
in
that.
if
you
don't
deliver
to
my
son
the
$25,
i'm
entitled
a
refund
of
it,
am
i
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
by
reason
of
agreement
between
us
at
the
time
i
purchase
the
draft.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
now
is
--
as
to
the
funds
that
are
involved
here,
what
do
they
represent?
monies
which
fathers
like
me
are
entitled
by
way
of
refund
because
of
non-delivery
or
monies
which
are
represented
perhaps
still
by
outstanding
drafts
which
should
not
delivered,
which?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
in
that
sense
the
father
no
longer
has
any
right
to
fund,
does
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
the
relationship
is
between
you
--
the
western
union
and
the
father
by
reason
the
father's
right
to
refund
or
between
western
union
and
the
son
by
reason
of
the
outstanding
draft,
where
it
be
the
son
will
be
to
holder
of
that
i
guess
it's
negotiable
draft.
relationship
was
one
as
far
as
western
union
is
concerned
of
debtor
to
creditor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what's
escheated
here
is
what?
the
property
of
the
creditors
and
not
of
the
western
union's?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
of
western
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
that's
negotiable
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
in
that
sense
the
property
interest
in
the
sense
of
the
creditor
is
owned
not
by
anybody
in
pennsylvania
but
outside
of
pennsylvania.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
pennsylvania's
statute
of
limitations
which
makes
the
claim,
whether
it's
claim
for
refund
or
the
claim
presented
by
the
draft
barred
by
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
the
new
jersey
case?
on
some
times
since
i
wrote
it,
but
i
had
a
recollection
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we've
turned
it
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
of
limitation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
not
escheatable
under
the
new
jersey
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
did
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
opinion
dealt
with
a
constitutional
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
to
the
extent
of
which
the
western
union
is
protected
by
a
statute
of
limitations.
if
the
proper
analysis
is
the
debtor
and
creditor,
then
to
that
extent,
at
least,
then
western
union
takes
these
funds,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
believe
that
the
obligation
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
buchanan
will
this
be
it,
if
pennsylvania
may
despise
the
interest
of
the
creditor
and
in
that
way
require
you
to
pay
your
obligation
owing
the
creditor
to
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
you
want
to
be
protected
against
some
other
state
with
the
creditor
actually
resides
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
you're
saying
well
now
that
property
--
pennsylvania
can't
displace
a
new
jersey
creditor
by
just
picking
up
western
union's
obligation
to
new
jersey,
if
anyone
may
do
that,
new
jersey's
got
to
be
it
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
new
york?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
you
were
at
delaware
corporation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
say
suppose
you
were.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
everything
as
it
is
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
this
also
your
point
mr.
buchanan
that
if
the
draft
arrives
and
sendee's
said
state
and
is
delivered,
you
don't
know
what
happens
to
it.
if
it's
not
delivered
within
72
hours
the
obligation
comes
back
to
an
obligation
of
the
sender's
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
suggest
though
mr.
creskoff
isn't
there
at
least
has
difference
that
the
sender
comes
into
a
pennsylvania
office
of
western
union
as
an
agreement
from
the
western
union,
that
if
show
order
its
office
in
connecticut
make
a
payment
of
x
dollars
to
somebody
in
connecticut.
since
a
draft
issued
from
the
connecticut
office,
the
obligation
with
western
union
undertook
in
pennsylvania
present
and
order
to
it's
connecticut
office
which
discharged
and
the
transaction
which
involved
in
what's
now
an
outstanding
draft
originated
not
in
pennsylvania,
in
that
sense,
but
in
connecticut
whereas
the
dividend
shops
which
we're
speaking
of
in
the
new
jersey
case
and
perhaps
my
memory
fails
me
but
i
thought
that
those
went
out
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
i
may
be
wrong
about
that
but
in
any
event,
the
initial
obligation
to
pay
dividend
was
discharged
in
new
jersey
by
the
draft
which
issued
in
new
jersey,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
the
check
rather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
were
drawn
on
but
were
they
drawn
by?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
you
made
it
right
about
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may
be
right
about
that.
i
rather
had
the
recollection
of
the
dividends
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
checks
originated
in
new
jersey
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
creskoff,
i
might
suggest
that
i
don't
think
you
don't
get
to
the
point
that
troubles
me.
i
don't
see
how
pennsylvania
has
a
better
claim
for
purposes
of
escheat.
by
reason
of
the
initiation
of
the
transaction
in
the
pennsylvania
office,
when
in
many
of
this
cases
at
least
the
terminal
part
of
the
transaction
now
represented
by
an
outstanding
draft,
to
place
at
an
office
in
another
state.
the
state
of
the
office,
where
the
sendee
was
at
least
at
the
time
where
the
order
went
then,
now,
why
should
pennsylvania's
connection
whit
the
transaction
rise
to
any
better
claim
than
that
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
only
then
but
i
as
understand
what
mr.
buchanan
answered
us
earlier,
i
haven't
look
at
this
record
to
know
the
actual
facts,
i
thought
what
he
told
us
was,
that
the
bulk
of
sum
escheated
is
represented
by
drafts,
issued
by
sendee
offices
which
have
never
been
presented
for
payment,
am
i
wrong
in
part
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
this
--
this
--
isn't
this
involved
us
with
a
tariff
of
requirements
and
whatever
may
have
been
the
words
in
the
understanding
between
the
clerk
and
the
sender
is
not
the
whole
transaction
as
defined
in
the
tariff.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
required
by
the
tariff?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
it's
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
honeypot
is
getting
entry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
mr.
buchanan?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
say
went
out
of
pennsylvania,
you
mean
that
literally
outside
of
pennsylvania?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
--
but
we
don't
know
though
how
many
of
them.were
the
sendees
in
pennsylvania?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
amount
is
almost
$35,000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
eat
into
your
time
mr.
buchanan
but
i
know
there's
something
about
destruction
of
your
records
under
sec
regulations
after
a
particular
period.
if
i
understand,
your
record
are
still
completed
and
so
that
you
can
identify
which
drafts
one
from
pennsylvania
to
what
offices
outside
of
pennsylvania?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
of
course
drafts
issued
by
an
office
outside
of
pennsylvania
where
that
is
you
have
no
idea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
but
they
would
show,
wouldn't
they,
the
sender,
sendee's
office
have
issued
a
draft,
the
sendee
office
that
issued
the
draft?
