is
your
client
is
a
stakeholder
and
you
don't
care

you're
paid
as
long
as
you're
protected?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
make
reports
to
western
union?
do
you
make
reports
to
more
than
new
york,
to
state
they
made
it
in
new
york?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
have
difficulty
in
determining
what
you
report?
how
do
you
do
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
the
one
who
got
it
first
was
the
one
entitled.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
if
then
--
if
you
and
minnesota
were
locked
into
an
argument
like
here
over
justice
frankfurter's
$12,000
who
would
win
it
or
who
should
win
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
residents
of
pennsylvania
had
been
taking
money
orders
to
be
delivered
in
minnesota
and
minnesota
office
of
western
union
never
could
bind
the
people
so
they
had
in
minnesota
$12,000.
