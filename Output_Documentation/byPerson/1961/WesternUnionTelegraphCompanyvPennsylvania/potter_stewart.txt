stewart
and
who's
the
drawee
of
the
draft,
who
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
western
union
is
drawer?
justice
potter
stewart
but
yet,
what
are
--
one
of
those
fiscal
agencies?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
sendee
is
the
--
is
the
payee
of
the
draft?
justice
potter
stewart
normally
--
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
really
fit
differ
much
with
check,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
how
about
the
situation
of
money
sent
to
pennsylvania
to
missouri
and
a
draft
drawn
to
missouri
and
given
to
the
sendee
and
the
sendee
never
cashes
and
does
in
testing
whether
that
draft
is
interstate.
certainly,
missouri
will
have
greater
rights
for
that
money,
would
it
not,
by
escheat
than
would
the
state
of
pennsylvania?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you'll
see
--
i'm
--
i'm
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
suggesting
an
answer
to
your
statement
that
you
couldn't
conceive
of
a
situation
where
that
would
be
to
the
state.
but
that
obviously
is
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
how
can
missouri
succeed
if
pennsylvania
had
already
cheated
the
money
under
this
decree?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
a
matter
of
service
of
process
here
i'm
just
suggesting
that
i
understand
that
you
know
the
fact
that
in
this
hypothetical
case
i
gave
you,
missouri
would
have
a
greater
right
to
escheat
than
pennsylvania.
justice
potter
stewart
and
get
under
this
decree,
the
money's
already
been
escheated
to
pennsylvania.
