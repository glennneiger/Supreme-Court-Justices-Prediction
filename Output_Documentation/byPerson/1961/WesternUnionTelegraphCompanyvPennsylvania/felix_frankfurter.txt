justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it,
you're
starting
you
--
your
contention
from
where
the
decision
of
this
court
have
left
you,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
where
did
--
where
do
the
decisions
of
this
court
leave
you
to
--
and
leave
you
open
to
make
whatever
contention
you
are
planning
to
make?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there's
--
if
there
has
been
no
change
of
residence
prior
to
maturity
of
policy
by
debt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
new
york
in
the
insurance
case
we
couldn't
tell
that
is
--
that's
what
bothers
some
of
us,
we
couldn't
tell
what
--
what
the
domicile
of
the
beneficiaries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
you
said
the
cases
lead
you,
rather
narrow
maneuvering
ground,
what
is
open
to
you
to
argue
the
different
case,
this
case
from
the
standard
oil
and
the
insurance
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
just
indicated
there
you
already
had
a
(inaudible).
here,
you
haven't
gone
by
a
thing,
you
may
have
a
legal
read
in
the
sense
of
an
obligation
and
pursue
of
all
the
cover,
i
thought
that
you
haven't
gone
anything
here
at
all,
have
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
do
anymore,
i
take
it
mr.
buchanan,
and
to
find
vulnerability
in
your
statute
in
relation
to
your
case.
you
have
a
merely
negative
task
but
have
you
and
do
you
care
to
state
what
do
you
think
is
the
solution
of
this
conundrum
that
you
just
put?
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
just
put
a
conundrum.
you
said
there
are
four,
five
states
unlike
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
black
i
think
earlier,
justice
black
and
the
chief
justice
earlier
before
lunch,
namely
that
is
one
or
all
or
nothing.
you
now
indicated
because
there
might
be
five,
four
or
five
candidates
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
his
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
address
to
yourself
to
what
you
think
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
with
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
--
international
shoe?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
that
depends
on
situs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
now
what's
the
matter
with
the
new
rule
that
deviates
maybe
a
little
old
about
the
old
rule,
that
situs
of
the
intangible
credit
is
the
domicile
of
the
debtor
and
make
it
perhaps
if
that
what
it
requires,
the
domicile
of
the
principal
office
or
chief
place
of
business
of
the
debtor,
would
that
be
alright?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
got
to
have
some
rule
by
which
to
determine
situs,
haven't
you,
in
order
to
determine
presence
of
the
raise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
buchanan,
when
you
said
that's
a
harder
case,
there
is
the
procedural
way
of
--
of
avoiding
all
these
rate
of
seizure,
illegal
seizure,
isn't
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
in
your
case
--
excuse
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
buchanan,
is
delaware
still
the
mother
of
corporation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he,
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
--
i
the
domicile
of
the
corporation
or
to
be
in
test,
delaware
would
be
in
excessively
affluent
society,
wouldn't
she?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
made
--
we
made
that
to
test
with
reference
to
jurisdictional
matters,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
harassment,
apart
from
collectability
is
concerned,
there
is
no
mode
of
correct
protection
except
in
having
all
potentially
interested
state
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
clean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
has
clean
cuttedness
barred
or
inhibited
litigation
by
lawyers?
that's
something
new.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
point
of
view
of
contact,
that
dubious
legal
term,
send
me
as
much
contact
with
reference
to
the
outstanding
draft
in
--
in
sendee's
state
as
there
is
in
pennsylvania
and
the
sender
--
and
the
sender's
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it's
fair
to
--
it's
fair
reading
of
the
decision
of
this
court
that
if
the
sendee
states
were
able
to
segregate
or
know
the
amounts
uncollected
in
the
sendee
state,
the
sendee
state
certainly
could
escheat.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
whether
they're
still
in
there
or
not,
certainly
they
reach
there
first,
but
that
was
the
starting.
from
the
point
of
view
of
contract,
if
it
means
anything,
namely
a
decent
relation
to
the
subject
matter,
that's
--i
can't
get
beyond
that
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that
power
of
the
western
union
which
is
doing
business
in
other
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
toch,
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
satisfy
a
curiosity
of
mine.
how
much
--
what's
the
size
of
the
fund
that
we
will
get
with
an
escheat
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
have
a
--
do
you
have
that
magnitude?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
i
understand
that.
it's
probably
there
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
just
want
to
know
what
the
gross
amount
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
before
this
last
statement
the
special
point
involved.using
this
court,
can
you
suggest
that
this
court
could
affirm
the
judgment
of
your
supreme
court
by
just
citing
the
insurance
cases
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
fact
in
the
--
do
you
think
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
are
now
before
us
common
within
the
--
in
the
decision,
i
don't
mean
the
rationale,
i
don't
mean
the
philosophy
but
i
mean
the
circumstances
which
were
relied
on
in
the
opinions
of
the
court
for
sustaining
the
claim
of
escheat
by
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
wasn't
that
a
great
emphasis
on
the
domiciliary
place
of
the
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that
talk
about
the
contacts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
proof
that
it's
that
--
that
(inaudible)
--
no,
i'm
sure
that
that
involved
--
the
implication
is,
if
they
had
it,
they
wouldn't
have
gone
after
it.
does
that
mean
that
it's
a
matter
of
law
that
issues
to
minnesota
and
south
dakota
and
florida
wouldn't
give
rise
to
legitimate
claim
of
contacts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
i
don't
follow
the
necessity
of
such
monistic
doctrine.
if
i
issue
a
check
in
one's
states,
which
gets
to
the
another
state
and
the
whole
of
it,
as
a
negotiable
instrument
funds
which
he
can
claim
in
the
courts
of
that
state
and
every
state,
why
do
you
cut
it
all
off
we
say
that
the
issuing
place
is
the
only
contact
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
course
of
business
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
that
--
it
is
the
course
of
business
to
have
a
draft.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
we're
going
to
talk
reality,
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
that
to
show
us
in
actual
that
the
applicant
for
a
money
order
in
pennsylvania
established
and
if
that
shows
that
he's
actually
residing,
a
legal
resident
of
pennsylvania
then
the
notification
of
the
payee
in
connecticut
or
new
york
that
he
may
come
up
and
turn
up
at
the
office
of
connecticut
and
new
york,
he
got
a
showing
and
that
would
make
it
suable
into
courts
of
that
state
against
the
western
union
in
there,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
that.
i'm
just
saying,
he
gets
a
notification
and
go
to
the
western
union
office
and
show
this
piece
of
paper
and
wants
$627
and
they
could
have
sold
him
a
baseball
game
or
what
not.
and
this
(inaudible)
he
could
sue
in
that
state
for
shows
in
that
piece
of
paper,
come
to
being
there,
doesn't
it?
i
mean
all
these
are
legal
reality
or
unrealities,
whichever
you
choose
to
call
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
to
identify
himself
that
he'd
have
to
accept
it.
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
creskoff,
suppose
needless
saying
the
decree
of
pennsylvania,
and
suppose
in
the
next
litigation
to
come
before
this
court,
one
of
this
greyhound
lines
where
they
got
these
escheats.
it
turns
up
in
minnesota
that
there
are
$12,000
and
$22,000
unclaimed
sendee
claim
against
the
western
union
in
minnesota
and
minnesota
wants
to
then
bring
the
escheat
proceeding
in
minnesota
against
the
western
union
and
sue
them
there.
if
one
votes
to
sustain
your
decree,
the
decree
you
got,
does
that
in
impliedly
mean
that
pennsylvania
that
minnesota
would
be
out
in
my
hypothetical
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
if
i
assumed
that
as
supposed
it
gives
full
paid
in
credit
to
that
decree
but
these
are
due
moneys
that
are
accumulated
since
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
said
that
our
claim,
the
basis
of
our
plane,
the
contact
we
have
for
the
unsatisfied
money
orders,
claim
within
minnesota,
is
that
$22,000
that
shows
in
action
not
redeemed
and
not
satisfied
in
minnesota
and
that
issue
was
never
contested.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
decree
in
western
union
against
commonwealth
merely
covered
the
funds
up
to
that
time.
i
want
to
know
whether
if
i
sustain
your
decree
i
foreclosed
all
these
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
it
one
or
the
other
when
you
say
superior
and
reading
as
implied
in
a
situation
where
there
are
multiple
interests,
what
compulsion
is
there
in
law,
in
the
constitution
in
good
sense
that
is
only
one
state
that
is
superior
to
all
the
others?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
relatively
new
field
with
all
the
said
and
done,
these
laws
didn't
get
on
the
way
until
the
late
30's.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you,
does
it
appear
in
the
record
if
it's
an
allowable
statement
that
you
can
make
outside
the
record?
how
many
--
how
many
states
it
was
the
nonappearance
of
the
sendee
that
led
to
the
nondischarge
of
the
original
deposit
in
pennsylvania
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
if
there
are
--
but
my
point
of
view
or
the
point
of
view
of
contact
as
i
understand
it
carrying
out
a
procedure
that
this
been
an
outline
if
in
fact
the
local
office
in
the
various
states
and
were
to
this
payee
or
that
they're
waiting
for
the
check
or
whatnot.
if
the
x
numbers
of
state
and
x
number
of
state
also
have
the
kind
of
contact
that
i
understand
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
be
satisfied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
--
and
if
they
each,
if
they
each
had
a
shorter
statute
of
limitation
of
a
period
of
installation
than
yours
and
each
ran
for
their
own
you'll
have
the
x
state
going
after
their
local
fund.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
because
from
my
point
of
view
pennsylvania
as
sender
the
state
would
be
out
because
i
think
the
receiving
state
would
ever
get
a
claim
because
that's
where
a
new
obligation
either
in
a
piece
of
paper
or
in
the
creation
of
a
new
shows
and
action,
that
was
the
--
as
it
was
the
domicile
of
the
grieving
states
and
all
of
these
and
i'm
afraid
play
either
than
most
of
writing
my
own
acts.
all
of
which
shows
that
this
ad
hoc
unitary
determination
of
what
is
essentially
is
a
non-unitary
problem
is
not
the
way
to
make
adjustment.
if
that
doesn't
help
you,
i
don't
mean
to
help.
that
needs
my
help.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
mean
to
--
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
compare
it
in
your
way
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
the
sendees
--
called
it
the
sendee's
state
where
your
property
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
asked
you
that
because
pennsylvania
is
so
rich
that
people
don't
make
claims.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
interest
rates
high
in
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
try
to
urge
a
breakdown
for
those
with
escheatable
claim
of
pennsylvania
in
order
to
differentiate,
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
point
you've
just
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
--
but
i
understand
that,
but
this
must
have
started
in
the
lower
court,
didn't
it,
in
a
litigation?
this
didn't
start
in
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
well
now,
did
you
there
say
pennsylvania
purports
to
escheat
only
the
senders'
property.
and
therefore,
they
must
took
it
to
the
senders
what
is
in
involved
in
escheating
an
obligation
owing
not
to
the
sender
but
owing
to
somebody
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
and
that
was
rejected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
total,
the
decree
to
be
escheated
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
includes
the
sender's
claim
what
might
be
sender's
claim
or
return
of
the
unclaimed
deposit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
well
as
sendees
in
minnesota
and
all
over
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
place.
