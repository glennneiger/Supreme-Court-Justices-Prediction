justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
it's
a
draft
in
any
event,
it's
accepted
before
it's
delivered.
so
it's
an
absolute
obligation
of
western
union,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
not
drawn
on
the
bank
but
it's
drawn
on
western
union
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
available
at
the
bank?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
an
effective
check,
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
can
you
not
distinguish?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
think
this
raise
was
to
the
pennsylvania
court
and
would
substitute
service
was
then
had
upon
the
creditor,
would
that
not
bind
new
york?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
my
reason
for
asking
in
this
question.
why
contacts
doesn't
do
it.
i
don't
understand
that.
is
it
not
a
question
of
where
is
the
raise?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
about
how
many
dollars
have
been
totally
involved
here
are
represented
by
outstanding
negotiable
drafts?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
my
position.
the
draft
is
not
issued
to
pennsylvania.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
the
telegram,
new
orleans
authorizes
and
new
orleans
office
should
have
it
delivered
there,
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
would
that
--
that's
the
theory,
due
to
the
court's
holding
in
standard
oil
against
new
jersey.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
involve
with
shares
in
stocks,
and
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
with
cash
dividends
accumulate
those
shares.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
it
was
held
there.
now,
new
jersey
has
no
place
of
business
at
all,
but
standard
oil
has
no
place
of
business
in
new
jersey,
that
was
its
domicile
and
yet
new
jersey
was
entitled
to
this
property
and
this
piece
of
land.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
one
more,
if
i
may.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
it
would
have
to
do
with
your
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
court
got
to
make
it,
it
hasn't
gone
up
to
now.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
mr.
creskoff,
is
it
really
a
question
of
which
state
has
the
better
or
more
equitable
claims?
is
it
not
really
a
question
of
whether
the
pennsylvania
judgment
here
validly
as
against
these
creditors
took
their
credits?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we're
not
here
--
now,
isn't
it
true
that
before
you
could
--
first
of
all,
do
you
agree
this
is
an
action
in
rem?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
had
no
personal
service
on
these
persons
whose
credits
you
took?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
right,
now
then
in
order
to
substantiate
the
substituted
service
on
these
unknown
persons
whose
credits
you
took,
did
you
not
have
to
first
have
a
raise
in
court?
now,
did
you
have
the
raise
in
court
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
how
did
you
get
it,
that's
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
question
for
me.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
still
don't
see
(inaudible)
basis
of
state
claim
the
presence
of
drafts
in
pennsylvania.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
it's
--
that
it's
the
question
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
did
they
seize
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
by
the
service
of
a
--
of
a
summon
on
western
union
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
that
not
have
been
served
in
any
one
in
the
48
states
in
the
same
way?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
don't
have
to
be
in
missouri.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
could
this
raise
only
found
in
any
one
of
the
48
states
of
the
claim,
am
i
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
it
could?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
was
some
place,
(inaudible)
that
takes
the
place
of
the
physical
raise
in
that
statute.
