mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
is
from
the
affirmance
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
of
a
decree
declaring
the
escheat
to
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
of
the
amounts
of
western
union
telegraphic
money
orders
which
originated
at
office
in
pennsylvania.
the
western
union
telegraph
company,
the
appellant,
asserts
that
the
pennsylvania
escheat
law
as
here
applied
is
repugnant
to
the
fourteenth
amend
--
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
escheats
these
amounts
with
which
the
pennsylvania
has
no
sufficient
contacts
without
sufficient
notice
and
without
giving
western
union
the
protection
to
which
it
is
entitled
or
should
be
entitled
under
the
constitution
against
liability
to
others
for
the
same
amounts.
western
union
is
a
new
york
corporation
with
its
principal
office
in
new
york
city.
it
has
thousands
of
offices
in
the
48
states
and
district
of
columbia
where
it
is
registered
to
do
business.
it's
not
registered
in
alaska
or
hawaii.
its
interstate
business
is
regulated
by
the
interstate
--
by
the
federal
communications
commission,
formerly
by
the
intestate
commerce
commission.
it
has
been
continuously
regulated.
a
telegraphic
money
order
transaction
is
designed
to
cause
a
credit
for
payment
of
money
to
be
telegraphed
from
the
office
of
origin
to
a
payee
at
another
office.
the
sender
--
sender
of
the
money
order
goes
into
western
union
office
and
fills
out
an
application
form
and
pays
the
principal
amount
plus
the
tolls
and
gets
a
receipt.
a
message
is
then
sent
from
the
office
of
origin
to
the
western
union
office
closest
to
the
designated
payee
who
is
often
called
the
sendee.
this
message
directs
the
second
office,
the
office
of
destination
to
make
payments
to
the
designated
sendee
by
negotiable
draft
the
file
tariffs
of
the
--
this
telegraph
company
call
for
this
form
of
payment.
the
office
of
destination
gets
to
in
touch
with
the
sendee.he
is
called
in
and
given
a
negotiable
draft.
if
he
wants
cash
immediately,
he
can
endorse
that
draft
and
in
fact
in
return
for
currency.
but
very
often,
because
this
draft
is
in
some
ways
preferable
to
cash,
he
walks
out
of
the
office
with
the
draft.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
drafts
are
drawn
on
banks
called
fiscal
agents
and
sub-fiscal
agents
of
western
union
but
they're
just
banks
in
various
cities
throughout
the
united
states
but
none
of
those
cities
are
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
western
union
draws
against
its
account
at
those
banks
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
one
of
those
fiscal
agencies?
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
sendee
is
named
as
the
payee
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
but
of
course
these
are
negotiable.
he
can
endorse
them
and
they
can
travel
as
couriers
without
luggage.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
it's
a
check.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
it
is
an
absolute
obligation
of
western
union.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
it
is
drawn
against
the
western
union's
account
at
the
bank.
it
is
a
draft
on
the
bank
but
those
bank
--
in
those
banks,
balances
are
maintained.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
it's
a
check.
it's
referred
in
the
book
of
rules
of
tariffs
as
a
draft,
that's
why
i
find
myself
calling
of
that.
but
it
is
payable
at
a
particular
bank.
and
it
is
also
payable
to
order
is
negotiable.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
we
do
want
to
be
protected,
your
honor,
and
in
our
position
in
this
case
is
this
pennsylvania
decree
cannot
protect
us.
first
of
all,
it
can't
protect
us
under
the
full
faith
of
the
credit
clause
and
it
can't
protect
us
even
if
this
court
said,
“oh
yes,
full
faith
of
the
credit
clause
would
protect
you
here.”
it
can't
protect
us
against
the
continual
harassments
that
we
would
have
and
people
that
might
not
take
that
as
the
last
word.
the
trouble
is
that
this
is
such
a
multistate
transaction;
anyone
of
these
money
order
transactions
can
involve
possible
claims
of
three
or
four
states.
therefore,
a
wise
rule
is
badly
needed
to
save
the
courts
and
litigants
and
my
clients
against
multiple
litigation
if
not
multiple
liability.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
other
states
have
brought
actions
or
made
claims,
some
of
them
under
the
uniform
unclaimed
property
act
don't
bring
actions,
they
just
say
give
us
a
return,
give
a
report
and
pay
the
money
in,
and
as
i
will
show
later,
some
of
those
are
quite
duplicative
as
of
the
same
moment
of
escheat.
just
very
confusing
to
the
owner
of
the
escheated.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
your
honor
as
i
will
indicate
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
as
i
will
indicate,
new
york
here
has
the
strongest
claim
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
oh
we
send
regular
reports
to
new
york
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
oh
yes,
they
regularly,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
money
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
--
money
permits.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
they
only
escheat
after
15
years.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
therefore,
they're
sometimes
too
late.
others
take
this
in
a
shorter
period
of
three
years.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
but
that
is
the
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
that
is
the
fact.
new
york
exerts
that
he
is
entitled
to
all
of
these
unclaimed
property.
before
i
--
made
statement
of
facts,
i'd
like
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
made
it
absolutely
clear
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question
that
though
we
cannot
under
the
pennsylvania
procedure
be
in
the
position
of
the
stakeholder
in
this
case,
we
think
we
should
in
all
equity
and
fairness
be
a
stakeholder
and
would
want
to
be
a
stakeholder.
some
state
is
entitled
to
all
of
the
funds
that
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
because
pennsylvania
has
no
provision
for
new
york
for
instance
which
has
already
brought
suit
for
at
least
part
of
the
particular
funds
back
of
the
particular
drafts
involved
in
this
pennsylvania
case.
there's
no
provision
for
new
york
to
come
into
the
pennsylvania
proceeding
even
if
new
york
wanted
to
and
maybe
they
would
choose
that's
well
we'd
like
two
bites
out
of
cherry
and
if
you
lose
to
pennsylvania,
you'll
have
lost
under
a
decree
that
doesn't
bind
us
and
we'll
come
in
again.
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
new
york
is
here
and
i'm
very
happy
to
have
given
a
quarter
of
my
time
to
her
because
i
think
that
when
you
hear
her
argue,
you
will
see
that
new
york
is
out
to
take
these
funds
under
its
custodial
statute.
it's
not
--
that
the
true
escheat
statue
--
statute
but
it's
the
equivalent
so
far
as
we're
concerned.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
with
good
seizure
of
the
raise
and
good
fair
notice,
an
opportunity
to
come
into
courts,
it
would
bind
new
york.
but
this
decree
that
we're
dealing
from
is
not
going
to
convince
new
york
that
it
is
bound.
hence,
i
am
afraid
that
unless
this
court
makes
it
very
clear
one
way
or
the
other,
other
states
will
not
feel
themselves
bound.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
very
nature
of
escheat
is
that
it
takes
100%
of
funds.
it's
one
or
another.
now,
whether
the
state
entitled
to
escheat,
is
entitled
by
mere
priority
regardless
of
contacts
which
is
pennsylvania's
position
here
or
whether
the
state
that
is
entitled
is
the
domiciliary
state
or
some
other
state,
only
one
state
can
take
the
funds.
if
more
than
one
can
take
it,
we
have
been
denied
due
process
by
a
multiple
taking.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
every
dollar
of
this
fund,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no,
some
of
these
funds
might
be
proven
to
be
new
to
the
state
of
nevada
or
i
don't
think
they
have
a
current
escheat
statute
or
say,
california.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
it's
up
22
and
it's
going
strong.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
relationship,
it
is
just
a
creditor-debtor.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
a
debt
owing
by
western
union
to
somebody
in
most
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no,
not
a
depositor
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
in
very
few
other
cases
is
the
fellow
that
gave
us
the
money,
the
one
who
is
the
obligee
because
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
if
we
don't
deliver
within
72
hours
and
that
is
--
is
the
next
step
in
the
procedure.
if
we
don't
deliver
a
negotiable
draft
to
your
son
within
72
hours,
then
you
are
entitled
to
a
rebate.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
agreement
as
set
up
by
the
filed
tariffs.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
though
i
wondered
whether
your
honor's
son
would
give
you
the
opportunity
with
refund,
the
majority
--
the
great
majority
of
the
monies
involved
here
are
cases
of
outstanding
negotiable
drafts
payable
to
the
sendees.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
son
at
college.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no.
it's
unlike
the
bank
deposit
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
--
cases
where
the
whole
idea
is
to
put
money
and
to
come
out
at
the
same
place.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
debtor
to
creditor,
evidenced
by
draft
in
almost
all
the
cases
--
in
some
of
the
cases.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
it's
the
interest
of
the
creditor.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no
it's
--
it's
an
obligation
of
western
union
but
it's
the
interest
in
that
obligation
which
is
escheated.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
typical
case
you
might
say
of
those
that
are
involved
here
is
an
out
of
state
sendee
or
is
endorsee
where
there
is
a
negotiable
draft
outstanding.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
and
it's
payable
outside
pennsylvania
under
the
negotiable
instrument
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
pennsylvania
in
its
escheat
does
not
recognize
the
statute
of
limitations.
we
did
plead
it
here
as
a
protection
to
those
better
entitled
to
these
funds
but
we
have
not
pressed
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
western
union
has
not
--
has
never
taken
that
as
its
personal
defense
in
a
suit
on
one
of
these
obligations.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
in
new
jersey
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
in
new
jersey.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
in
new
jersey
your
honor,
avoided
coming
to
the
constitutional
question
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
--
because
under
new
jersey
law,
the
statute
of
limitations
has
barred
it.
i
mean
the
constitutional
question
that's
involved
here.
but
new
jersey
since
your
honor
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
new
jersey
has
tried
to
get
around
that
by
passing
a
five-year
escheat
or
custodial.
all
the
states
are
after
this
sort
of
funds
and
it's
a
problem
which
is
going
to
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no.
the
western
union
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
western
union
as
a
matter
of
fact
pays
stale
drafts,
old
obligations.
there's
one
in
the
record
here
that
we
paid
off
while
this
was
pending
and
while
pennsylvania
was
claiming
it
dating
back
to
1935.
that
was
paid
in
new
york.
and
--
pennsylvania
cannot,
though
they
have
tried
in
their
brief,
say
to
us,
“you
have
to
plead
the
statute
of
limitations
and
therefore
you're
protected."
we
--
the
only
thing
that
pennsylvania
can
furnish
us
to
satisfy
the
constitution
when
they
take
this
is
the
right
to
plead
that
there
has
been
a
valid
escheat
decree
which
bars
all
others.
otherwise,
there
is
a
double
taking
or
the
possibility
of
a
double
taking
which
is
a
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
decisions
of
this
court
leave
us
a
fairly
narrow
scope.
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
based.
i
say
this
is
the
rationale
though
they
haven't
been
based
in
so
many
works
on
a
domiciliary
hold
on
the
property
taken.
the
bank
deposit
case
is
obviously
inclined
against
united
states
which
was
deposits
in
the
u.s.
marshals
office
in
philadelphia
taken
by
pennsylvania
because
the
--
those
funds
were
held
in
pennsylvania
by
what
is
--
for
those
purposes
of
pennsylvania
court.
in
connecticut
mutual
against
moore,
the
connecticut
mutual
was
a
foreign
life
insurance
corporation
though
its
--
its
regulated
status
and
its
method
of
doing
business
under
the
supervision
of
the
new
york
insurance
commissioner
in
effect
as
to
those
policies
made
it
the
same
as
the
new
york
corporation.
but
there,
the
only
thing
that
this
court
held
was
that
where
you
have
a
new
york
insured
and
new
york
beneficiary
and
a
policy
issued
in
new
york,
new
york
can
take
the
proceeds.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
exactly,
that
has
to
be
the
situation
at
the
date
of
the
escheat
or
the
date
maturity
of
the
policy.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
it
bothers
me
as
to
whether
that
case
decided
at
anything
your
honor,
but
at
least
we
know
what
it
didn't
decide
in
part.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
domiciliary
hold,
standard
oil
of
course,
that's
the
most
recent;
it
was
a
case
of
domiciliary
corporation.
they
said,
“if
it's
the
money
you
owe,
give
us
your
stock
which
is
located
at
the
registered
office
of
the
--
in
the
domiciliary
state."
the
stock
is
much
closer
than
anything
else
to
the
corporate
heart.
give
us
its
stock
in
these
--
under
dividend
checks
because
you
are
a
domiciliary
state
and
that
is
the
holding.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
a
mere
legal
obligation.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
new
york
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
--
or
new
york,
yes.
the
--
if
pennsylvania
by
simply
saying,
“well,
we
can
serve
your
registered
agent
and
therefore,
we
have
power
to
seize
the
raise
that
is
a
hard
thing
to
seize
simply
by
service.
well
then,
anyone
of
48
states
or
the
district
of
columbia
that
has
an
escheat
or
custodial
statute
can
do
the
same
thing.
and
as
i
indicated
before
lunch,
there
are
some
of
the
custodial
statutes
under
the
uniform
act
where
the
period
of
dormancy,
the
period
for
escheat
is
exactly
seven
years,
the
date
of
escheats
and
presumably
the
moment
of
escheat
is
exactly
the
same
day
in
each
year.
so
that
four
or
five
states
by
their
legislative
action,
escheat
the
same
amounts
could
escheat,
the
same
amounts
due
from
all
over
the
country,
simply
because
they
can
get
jurisdiction
of
western
union
in
that
state.
then
which
one
of
four
or
five
that
have
the
identical
statute
is
the
escheator?
you'd
have
an
automatic
quadruple
or
quintuple
escheat
or
taking
into
custody
at
the
same
moment.
the
very
theory
of
escheat
is
that
a
court
decree
only
declares
escheat
that
has
already
taken
place,
but
if
pennsylvania
by
speedy
action,
runs
through
its
own
courts
and
gets
a
final
decree
and
if
therefore
able
to
cut
off
the
claims
of
four
or
five
other
states,
that's
we're
doing
the
same
thing
but
didn't
get
there
as
fast,
then
has
pennsylvania's
action
nullify
the
escheats
which
had
already
occurred
in
this
other
cases
just
through
the
action
of
its
courts?
the
metaphysical
questions
are
impossible
as
i
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
i
believe
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
theoretically
you
have
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
i
think
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
i
think
your
honor
in
this
case,
the
state
of
domicile
is
the
only
one
which
should
take
under
any
wise
decision.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
state
of
domicile
and
that
is
new
york
--
the
state
of
domicile
of
western
union
because
that
is
the
only
domiciliary
fact
that
is
known
this
whole
complex
business.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
but
at
least
the
domiciliary
state
has
the
tie,
the
control
--
real
control
over
this
corporation.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
interest
of
corporation
your
honor
is
not
the
important
thing.
new
york
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
new
york
has
the
ties
and
to
control
the
contacts,
sufficient
contacts
in
the
language
of
the
cases.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no.
the
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
--
sufficient
contact,
the
language
of
international
shoe
don't
apply
here
at
all,
your
honor.
a
different
sort
of
interest
is
involved
and
must
be
considered,
the
same
with
the
multiple
taxation
cases.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
situs.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
it's
too
right.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
that
certainly
would
be
alright
your
honor.situs
is
perhaps
an
old
fashioned
word
but
i
think
it's
a
wise
word
in
case
like
this.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
right
your
honor,
and
domicile
in
this
case,
i
submit
that
it's
very
easy
to
find
the
situs.
the
debtor's
state
of
incorporation,
the
debtor's
principal
office,
the
debtor's
treasury
to
which
all
of
these
unclaimed
money
orders
filtered
back,
they
go
into
the
cash
until
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
new
york.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
and
we
had
our
principal
office
in
new
york.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
that
would
be
a
little
harder
question.
i'm
glad
we
are
altogether
here.
we
would
have
no
fear
of
multiple
escheats.
we
would
have
a
good
defense
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
if
new
york
had
been
fast
enough
to
take
these
funds
first.
they
brought
their
suit
but
they
have
a
15-year
escheat
statute.
they're
not
quite
so
greedy
and
my
friend
from
new
york
state
would
say,
well
they're
not
greedy
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
have
a
very
well
setup
escheat
system
which
does
not
take
fast
but
takes
wisely.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
if
this
court
would
entertain
the
suit,
we
would
be
glad
to
the
--
the
--
pay
the
money
into
the
--
into
this
court
and
let
the
states
fight
it
out,
but
we
are
in
that
position,
we're
in
that
position
of
having
had
it
taken
from
us
by
pennsylvania.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
in
that
case,
delaware,
your
honor,
under
that
standard
of
new
jersey
case
would
have
a
clear
right
to
escheat.
but
this
court
would
have
the
problem
of
bringing
together,
considering
together
the
interest
of
new
york
and
delaware
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
suggestion
of
a
interpolator
on
the
order
of
texas
against
florida
would
be
the
only
real
solution
in
that
case.
unless
this
court
said
domicile
is
the
good,
easy
rule,
it's
fair
on
the
average
to
everyone
concerned,
stick
to
domicile.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
well
i
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
i
said
it
might
be
fair
on
the
average
but
your
honor
indicates
well
some
states
might
average
out
better
than
others.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
new
york
i
suppose
would
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
and
arizona.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
or
panama.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
it
--
i'm
glad
i'm
on
this
side
of
the
batch,
these
questions
in
fairness
are
not
mine
for
ultimate
decision.
i
say
in
this
case,
the
questions
of
fairness,
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
true
owners.
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
other
states,
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
orderly
administration
of
justice
to
avoid
reasons
to
escheat,
unseemly
the
competition
between
states
all
call
for
a
reversal
of
this
pennsylvania
decree.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
when
it
comes
to
horse
trading,
i
represent
the
horse
here.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
we
do
not
want
to
be
held
twice.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
and
i
think
that
we
and
other
similarly
situated
and
the
states
who
are
otherwise
going
to
be
contending
over
every
little
escheatable
bit
of
property
are
entitled
to
a
clear,
firm
rule.
whether
that
be
domicile,
you
say
that
might
not
be
fair
principal
place
a
business,
but
here,
there
is
an
additional
factor.
the
monies
that
are
paid
on
these
unclaimed
amounts
and
were
represented
mainly
be
negotiable
drafts,
eventually
find
their
way
back
into
the
treasury
in
new
york
of
the
western
union
company
and
that
after
two
years
under
federal
communications
commission
regulations,
these
unpaid
amounts
have
to
be
taken
in
as
income.
they
thus
enter
into
the
profit-loss
statement
and
into
the
regulated
rate
structuring.
they
are
already
given
back
but
we
will
lose
a
little
something
here
but
the
--
when
we
have
to
pay
the
amounts
under
this
new
escheat
statutes
but
they
either
go
back
to
the
general
public
when
they
weren't
claimed
by
us
or
in
reduction
of
rates
or
they
should
go
to
one
certain
place.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
an
incorporator
myself
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
i
like
the
pennsylvania
corporation
myself.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
as
mr.
justice
black
points
out,
maybe
that's
too
good.
but
the
principal
office
--
where
the
principal
office
coincides
with
the
state
of
incorporation,
where
the
actual
work
is
done
there.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
exactly
your
honor
--
yes
and
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
and
new
york
is
very
fair
about
it,
the
new
york
life
and
the
metropolitan.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
in
the
mutual
of
new
york.
they
only
take
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
that's
exactly
our
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
we're
not
interested
so
far
as
--
so
long
as
we
are
thoroughly
protected.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
though
i
indicated
if
new
york
were
entitled
--
were
held
by
this
court
to
be
the
--
the
state
entitled
to
escheat,
i
don't
think
anybody
else
would
be
picking
on
us
because
that
would
be
clean
cut.
you
either
need
a
clean
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
i
would
suggest
first
your
honor
that
it's
not
windfall
for
new
york
because
it
holds
it
in
custody
and
if
claimant
shows
up,
(voice
overlap)
back.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
you're
asking
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
you're
asking
in
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
you're
asking
me
your
honor
for
my
second
choice?
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
yes.
we
think
that
we
would
be
better
protected
under
the
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
if
in
line
with
those
cases,
new
york
were
held
to
be
the
state
here.
but
if
--
if
we're
not
to
be
new
york,
the
only
other
states
are
those
that
can
have
--
can
show
the
presence
of
these
negotiable
drafts
or
the
states
in
which
the
banks
are
situated
on
which
those
drafts
are
drawn.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
we
don't
--
we
don't
know
where
those
people
are,
what
state
they
are
resident
in
because
the
very
nature
of
this
business
is
the
money
goes
particularly
when
it's
in
a
form
of
draft,
as
a
courier
without
luggage.
from
state
to
state
and
is
has
rapidly
as
can
be
imagined.
the
money
certainly
went
out
of
pennsylvania
with
the
speed
of
the
electricity
when
the
wire
was
sent,
say
from
pennsylvania
to
san
francisco,
transmitting
a
money
order
to
somebody
who
got
within
72
hours,
a
draft
there.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
any
single
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
negotiable
drafts
themselves?
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
but
the
holders
--
the
holders
of
them
did
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
from
time
to
time.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
holders
are
the
people
entitled
to
the
money.
the
holders
of
the
drafts
whether
endorsees
or
original
holders
and
--
but
we
don't
know
where
they
are.
we
know
where
these
banks
are,
where
the
drafts
were
drawn
but
in
this
present
state
to
this
record
this
case
can
only
be
sent
by
saying
how
sort
out
which
of
these
money
order
transactions
is
tied
up
with
a
bank
in
chicago
or
one
in
memphis
or
one
in
san
francisco
or
los
angeles.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
almost
all,
your
honor.
the
--
with
great
majority
of
the
money
involved
here
is
represented
by
outstanding
drafts
that
were
issued
to
sendees
or
payees.
the
next
amount
in
size
is
refund
drafts
outstanding,
but
then
there
are
also
cases
where
the
sender
never
went
back
to
get
his
refund
draft
and
therefore
there
are
only
one
negotiable
receipt
outstanding,
that's
a
very
small
part
of
it.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
even
more
your
honor
because
it
was
the
sender's
idea
that
kept
that
draft
out
there
into
that
other
state.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor,
some
of
these
were
intrastate
and
from
one
point
is
pennsylvania
to
another
one-six
dozen
approximately.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
if
they
can
prove
that
the
drafts
are
still
in
the
sendee
states
and
so
on,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
however,
they
would
have
no
power
over
those
sendees
perhaps
in
most
of
the
cases
because
the
fellow
that
needs
a
money
order
remits
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
that's
right,
but
the
fellow
who
typically
gets
a
remittance
is
either
so
journeying
at
college
shall
we
say
or
passing
through
hung-up.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
refund
draft.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
and
that
refund
draft
maybe
uncashed
and
wander
out
anywhere
in
the
country.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
yes,
indeed,
we
make
reports;
i
presumed
the
all
22
states
that
presently
have
this
at
least
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
particularly
when
the
acts
are
vague
and
don't
indicate
exactly
what
they
want
us
to
report
and
then
we
ask
and
they
say,
“we
want
you
report
everything”.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
in
the
three
minutes
which
you
mr.
chief
justice
have
graciously
awarded
me,
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
i'd
like
to
point
out
just
a
couple
of
things
from
the
record
in
answer
to
the
two
various
questions
that
have
been
asked.
on
the
number
of
--
on
the
amount
coming
into
pennsylvania,
if
your
honors
will
refer
to
page
57
of
the
record,
it
shows
that
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
57.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
it
shows
the
$23,590
were
found
to
be
originating
elsewhere
not
taken
by
pennsylvania
and
about
$40,000
to
some
of
two
other
figures
without
pennsylvania.
so
pennsylvania
has
chosen
the
bigger
approach,
the
bigger
end
of
this
stake
on
the
idea
that
can
only
have
one
answer.
i
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
well,
originated
in
pennsylvania,
excuse
me.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
yes,
we
do
know
approximately
five-sixth
went
out
of
pennsylvania,
five-sixth
of
the
total.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
that
same
page
shows
that
$31,500
was
destined
out
of
pennsylvania,
$6,000
within
pennsylvania,
$23,000
coming
in
from
out
of
state.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
the
--
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
that
the
record
does
not
show
but
the
record
does
show
that
all
drafts
issued
less
than
1%
are
refund
drafts,
that
was
a
sample
which
shown
at
the
page
--
i
don't
remember
the
name
in
the
page
in
the
records.
it's
not
page
59.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
one-sixth
for
intrastate.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
no.
we
have
the
records
of
a
drafts
involved
in
this
case.
but
they
have
not
been
statistically
analyzed.
mr.
john
g.
buchanan,
jr.
yes,
with
some
reservation
i
say
that
the
records
weren't
so
good
some
earlier
years.
mr.
justice
brennan
you
asked
about
the
book
of
rules
the
tariffs,
the
filed
tariffs.
at
pages
61
to
page
64
of
the
record
are
the
extracts
from
the
filed
tariffs
and
each
one
starts
by
saying,
“all
payments
will
be
made
by
drafts.”
there
are
some
provisions
for
paying
cash
in
certain
instances
but
at
the
very
least,
those
--
these
filed
tariffs
give
western
union
the
option
at
least,
the
very
least,
no
matter
how
you
read
them
to
pay
by
drafts.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
douglas
had
some
question
about
the
situation
in
minnesota,
will
minnesota
sit
back
and
let
pennsylvania,
the
pennsylvania
decree
rule
us,
i
say
no.
minnesota
is
free
to
say
pennsylvania
sent
out
a
notice
filed
a
petition,
sent
out
a
notice
saying,
“we
are
taking
money
refundable
to
senders,”
and
that's
what
the
notice
said
here.
but
we're
--
we
are
taking
drafts
payable
to
sendees
says
minnesota
because
this
whole
proceedings
started
out
saying
in
the
notice
saying,
“we're
just
taking
money
refundable
to
senders”
but
in
the
end
they
took
something
much
broader
than
that
payable
to
sendees,
payable
to
endorsees
and
drafts
and
so
on.
and
