escheator.
mr.
buchanan,
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
any
other
state
ever
brought
any
actions
to
escheat
this
money?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course,
well
do
you
--
do
you
concede
that
--
in
these
circumstances,
some
state
couldn't
cheat
the
money?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
state
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
ever
done
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
they
ever
escheated
the
money?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
probably
your
whole
system?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
i
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
has
new
york
attempted
to
escheat
the
money
on
all
of
your
--
all
your
transactions
throughout
the
country
because
you
are
incorporated
in
new
york?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
the
fact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
you
say
if
your
company
was
incorporated
in
delaware
and
had
its
principal
place
in
a
business
in
new
york,
where
would
the
escheat
lie?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mrs.
kessler
toch.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
kessler
toch,
i
wonder
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
we
don't
use
contacts
in
different
senses
here
now,
when
we're
determining
what
the
dominant
contacts
should
be,
what
contacts
are
we
talking
about?
the
contacts
with
the
company
or
are
we
talking
about
the
contacts
with
the
person
to
whom
who
owes
--
to
whom
the
money
is
owed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
that's
--
that's
just
what
i
want
to
ask
and
why
--
why
should
it
be
that
way
in
this
escheat
matter,
i
can
see
if
there
was
contest
between
the
person
to
whom
the
money
was
to
be
paid
and
the
person
who
is
to
pay,
that
perhaps
the
contacts
of
the
person
who
is
to
pay
would
be
the
appropriate
one,
but
here
we're
not
doing
that.
here
the
company
has
no
interest
in
this
money
at
all
and
the
--
and
the
only
person
who's
interested
in
it
would
be
the
person
who's
entitled
payment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
--
i
could
agree
to
that
because
the
--
if
the
western
union
and
takes
money
in
pennsylvania
to
send
to
a
person
in
another
part
of
pennsylvania,
i
don't
know
that
we
necessarily
need
to
say
that
--
that
they
hold
it
in
new
york.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
don't,
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
because
they
wanted
to
do
business
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
all
their
business,
say
can
in
new
york,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
money
was
paid
in
pennsylvania
and
it
was
supposed
to
be
paid
out
in
pennsylvania.
why
must
we
then
say
that
the
money
is
being
held
in
new
york?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
some
--
some
of
the
cases
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
aren't
in
overall
rule
that
will
--
will
govern
in
all
cases.now,
certainly
you
have
to
be
bound
by
some
of
the
cases
that
you
bring
before
us
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
may
i
tell
you
one
other
thing
troubling
then
i
won't
--
won't
bother
you
anymore.
i
notice
one
of
the
things
that
subjected
to
about
the
escheat
in
pennsylvania
is,
that
the
notice
is
not
adequate.
now,
i'm
just
wondering
this,
if
the
escheat
is
always
to
be
in
new
york,
do
you
think
notice
could
ever
be
really
adequate
in
cases
where
the
telegram
was
sent
in
arizona
let
us
say
to
a
payee
in
arizona.
how
would
in
any
notice
in
new
york
be
good
notice
to
that
payee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he's
the
really
--
the
person
who's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
who's
involved
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
merely
because
new
york
has
a
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
law.
now
it
might
be
--
there
might
another
state
that
doesn't
have
it
in
that
one
--
a
law
in
a
case,
in
a
case
where
corporation
would
be
bound
whatever
rule
--
faction
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
kessler,
what
would
you
say
if
this
company
was
incorporated
in
delaware
and
had
its
principal
place
business
in
new
york,
would
it
pass?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
three
extra
minutes
to
finish
argument,
and
that
time
(voice
overlap)
by
the
other
side
the
same
of
course.
now,
mr.
--
mr.
creskoff.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
buchanan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
about
five
minutes.
you
have
five
minutes.
