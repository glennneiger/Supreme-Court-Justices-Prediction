mr.
robert
r.
bair
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
unique
feature
of
this
case
is
that
there
is
no
current
labor
dispute
involved.
there
was
no
preexisting
working
condition
which
had
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
management
of
this
company
which
had
been
made
the
subject
of
a
labor
controversy.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
board
itself
made
no
specific
finding
that
there
--
that
there
was
a
current
labor
dispute
in
this
case.
they
merely
adverted
to
what
they
called
prior
complaints
about
the
cold.
what
were
these
prior
complaints?
there
were
on
--
there
were
seven
employees
who
were
discharged.
only
three
of
these
employees
testified
on
the
subject
of
prior
working
conditions,
and
these
three
did
not
use
the
word
complaint.
the
general
counsel
asked
them
whether
they
had
made
any
complaints
before
this
walkout
about
working
condition.
caron,
the
leader,
said
he
used
to
talk
to
the
foreman.
he
talked
to
the
foreman
about
the
cold.
the
second
man,
heinlein,
said
he
remarked
about
the
cold
on
prior
occasions.
he
remarked,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
i
--
when
i
on
cross-examination
asked
him
about
these
remarks,
he
said
he
spoke
several
times
during
the
past
six
months,
maybe
a
year,
maybe
two
years
ago
whereas,
only
two
months
prior,
in
november
of
1958,
the
respondent
installed
a
500,000
btu
furnace
in
a
shop,
an
additional
furnace,
not
a
replacement
but
an
additional
furnace
in
a
shop,
the
heat
from
which
flowed
in
to
this
machine
shop.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
completely
knocks
out
any
value
that
the
heinlein
testimony
had.
now,
the
third
witness
is
a
man
named
george,
and
george
was
asked
about
prior
complaints.
but
did
he
respond
by
saying
complaint?
he
said
no.
no.
he
asked
the
foreman
several
times
why
the
furnace
would
not
put
out
more
heat.
now,
this
is
the
sum
total
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
about
a
current
labor
dispute.
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
concerted
action
taken.
these
--
these
so-called
remarks
asks
about
--
asking
about
the
cold,
used
to
talk
about
the
cold
were
topics
of
conversation
such
as
you
have
in
every
plant
with
the
doors
opening
and
shutting,
bringing
business
in
and
out.
it
was
--
they
were
topics
of
conversation
just
as
they
were
topics
of
conversation
during
the
summer
when
the
men
were
breaking
about
the
heat.
now,
to
raise
this
evidence
into
a
current
labor
dispute,
with
which
congress
was
concerned,
with
which
--
which
leads
to
strikes,
which
obstruct
commerce,
which
gives
this
court
and
the
board
the
very
source
of
jurisdictional
power
to
govern
actions
which
are
involved
here,
to
raise
this
evidence
into
a
current
labor
dispute
is
absurd.
there
was
--
there
was
not
--
there
was
no
concerted
action
whatever.
there
were
--
there
was
no
labor
organization
involved
in
this
case
whatever.
there
was
no
organizational
activity
involved
in
this
case
whatever.
there
were
seven
men,
working
in
a
machine
shop,
it
was
a
cold
day,
15
degrees,
18
degrees
below
the
normal
for
that
day,
the
winds
were
howling
from
23
to
43
miles
an
hour.
the
furnace
--
the
main
furnace,
1,500,000
btu
furnace
was
not
operating.
the
watchman
didn't
know
how
to
start
it
for
some
strange
reason,
but
it
was
not
operating.
it
was
started
just
as
soon
as
the
company
electrician
arrived
at
the
plant
at
7:15
in
the
morning.
these
men
were
huddled
outside
of
the
foreman's
shop.
the
leader
told
the
men
what
the
foreman
had
said
to
him.
if
they
had
any
guts,
they'd
go
home,
and
so
they
went
home.
they
went
home
because
it
was
cold.
we
do
not
deny
that.
they
went
home
because
of
what
caron
told
them
that
jarvis
said
about
them,
if
they
had
any
guts,
they'd
go
home.
these
were
the
two
reasons
the
men
went
home.
the
men
did
not
go
home
because
there
was
a
current
labor
dispute,
because
this
was
a
protest
against
the
cold.
the
men
went
home
because
it
was
cold.
now,
why
is
the
existence
of
a
current
labor
dispute
so
important?
as
i
said
previously,
the
labor
dispute
is
the
very
source
from
which
this
court
and
from
which
the
board
and
from
which
congress
attains
jurisdiction
to
act
in
matters
of
this
kind.
section
1
of
the
wagner
act
is
very
explicit
on
the
subject.
section
2
(3)
defining
employee
and
section
2
(9)
defining
labor
dispute
expressly
recognizes
the
need
for
a
current
labor
dispute.
section
2
(3)
preserves
an
employee's
status
under
the
act.
it
recognizes
that
if
an
employee
ceases
work
as
a
result
of
unfair
labor
practice,
he
remains
an
employee
under
the
act.
section
2
(3)
states
further
that
where
there
is
economic
strike
involved,
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
but
the
employer,
where
an
employee
ceases
work
in
consequence
of
or
in
connection
with
a
current
labor
dispute,
he
remains
an
employee
under
the
act.
therefore,
i
say
that
in
this
case
unless
there
is
current
labor
dispute,
the
statute
does
not
recognize
these
employees
as
retaining
their
employee
status.
the
mackay
case
referred
to
by
mr.
manoli
holds
just
this.
there
was
a
question
before
this
court
in
that
case
as
to
whether
there
was
a
current
labor
dispute.
this
court
found
that
there
was.
there
were
negotiations,
collective
bargaining
negotiations
leading
towards
the
hope
of
a
contract
governing
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions.
there
is
no
such
thing
here.
this
court's
decision
in
the
labor
board
against
the
electrical
workers
likewise
recognizes
the
importance
of
the
concerted
activity
occurring
in
the
context
of
a
current
labor
dispute.
now,
not
only
does
section
2
(3)
of
the
act
recognize
the
importance
of
a
current
labor
dispute.
section
10
(c)
which
gives
the
board
the
power
to
reinstate
employees
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
refers
to
employee
to
obtain
a
definition
of
employees.
we
go
back
to
section
2
(3)
where
again
we
arrived
at
the
requirements
of
a
current
labor
dispute
before
employees
quitting
work,
retain
their
employee
status
under
the
act.
now,
we
submit
that
the
board
should
have
made
a
finding
as
to
whether
or
not
the
evidence
consisted
of
--
constituted
a
current
labor
dispute.
they
passed
over
this
jurisdictional
prerequisite
i
believe
because
of
their
belief
that
the
punishment
was
disproportionate
to
the
offense.
they
thought
the
discipline
was
too
severe.
but
it
is
submitted
that
the
harshness
or
the
mildness
of
discipline
is
not
a
matter
for
the
board
to
determine.
management
is
much
better
qualified
at
least
in
this
one
phase
of
labor
relations
to
decide
what
is
best
to
maintain
order
and
discipline
in
a
particular
plant
governed
by
peculiar
conditions
of
the
business
in
this
particular
plant.
it
is
not
for
the
board
to
decide
whether
discipline
is
harsh
or
severe.
and
we
believe
that
in
this
case,
the
board
was
in
actuality
substituting
its
judgment
for
that
of
management
in
the
question
of
the
severity
of
punishment.
turning
now
to
the
question,
assuming
arguendo
that
the
facts
in
this
case
can
support
a
finding
of
a
current
labor
dispute,
where
are
we
then?
assuming
that
the
testimony
of
these
three
men
asking
about
the
cold,
remarking
about
the
cold,
talking
about
the
cold
can
be
ballooned
into
a
labor
dispute,
where
are
we?
the
employee
--
the
employer
discharged
these
men
for
a
cause.
the
cause
was
that
the
men
left
the
plant
without
notice
to
the
foreman,
without
discussing
the
matter
with
the
foreman,
without
requesting
anything
of
the
foreman,
without
investigating
whether
or
not
the
furnace
was
running,
without
asking
for
a
conference,
without
making
an
ultimatum.
they
did
not
inform
anybody
of
the
action
they
were
taking
of
the
objects
they
sought
of
the
purposes
they
thought
that
they
were
going
to
achieve.
the
true
motives
of
the
employer
in
this
case
and
there's
no
evidence
that
contradict
this
or
simply
to
punish
the
men
for
infraction
of
the
plant
rule,
namely
leaving
the
plant
without
permission.
mr.
robert
r.
bair
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
r.
bair
i
think
the
significance
there
is
that
it
presented
to
the
men
a
challenge
or
a
dare
or
an
encouragement,
and
that
the
men
may
very
well
have
left
because
of
that
and
but
for
that,
they
might
not
have
left.
now
if
that
is
so,
that
indicates
to
me
all
the
more
clearly
that
the
men
did
not
leave
to
protest
a
preexisting
working
condition.
mr.
robert
r.
bair
no
your
honor
i
do
not.
i
think
the
evidence
will
show
your
honor
that
caron
and
jarvis,
the
leader
and
the
foreman
frequently
talked
together
in
a
jocular
fashion.
they
frequently
kidded
one
another
about
activities
in
and
about
the
plant.
this
was
not
a
serious
conversation
that
took
place
in
the
foreman's
office.
i
think
the
record
will
bear
that
out
your
honor.
now,
the
board
did
not
try
to
explain
to
discredit
or
give
any
reasons
for
disregarding
the
employer's
evidence
of
the
reasons
or
the
motives
behind
the
discharges.
i
don't
know
why.
i
think
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
board
in
discharge
cases
to
give
some
reason
for
disregarding
the
evidence
of
the
respondent.
the
house
conference
report,
number
510
of
the
88th
congress
points
this
out
very
clearly
at
page
56.
and
then
section
10
(c)
as
enacted
by
the
taft-hartley
act
completely
deprives
the
board
of
power
to
reinstate
employees
discharged
for
cause.
that
is
the
language
of
section
10
(c).
the
board
shall
not
have
power
to
reinstate
employees
who
are
suspended
or
discharged
for
cause.
so
on
page
75
of
the
appendix
a
to
the
respondent's
brief,
the
last
paragraph
of
section
10
(c).
now,
it
maybe
asked
what
happens
when
you
have
a
conflict
between
10
(c)
giving
the
employer
the
power
to
discharge
for
cause
and
section
7,
giving
the
employees
right
to
take
concerted
action
for
their
mutual
aid
and
protection.
i
have
no
difficulty
reconciling
the
two
sections.
it
seems
to
me
that
section
7
contemplates
something
that
has
to
do
with
an
employer
unfair
labor
practice,
which
is
not
involved
here
a
prior
preexisting
unfair
labor
practice,
or
it
must
have
something
to
do
with
collective
bargaining,
negotiation,
conference,
self-organization.
here
in
this
case
as
i
say,
there
was
no
notice,
no
demand,
no
ultimatum,
no
discussion,
no
conference.
you
have
a
bold
unannounced
walkout.
turning
to
the
employer's
activities
in
this
case,
you
have
no
refusal
by
the
company
to
do
anything.
you
have
the
instant
action
of
the
company
in
trying
to
correct
the
condition
and
the
condition
was
corrected
within
minutes
after
the
electrician
arrived.
working
temperatures
were
normal
by
noontime.
two
months
prior,
the
company
had
installed
a
500,000
btu
furnace
in
a
shop
to
supplement
the
heating
plant.
so,
we
have
here,
it
seems
to
me,
a
way
to
reconcile
section
10
(c)
and
section
7.
section
7
uses
the
word
other
concerted
activities
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
or
other
mutual
aid
and
protection
and
it
is
submitted
that
the
word
other
refers
back
to
collective
bargaining.
the
mutual
aid
refers
to
an
attempt
by
the
employees
to
aid
themselves
in
improving
working
conditions
as
to
which
there
is
a
dispute.
it
contemplates
going
to
the
employer
conferring
with
him,
negotiating
with
him,
and
if
unable
to
agree
then
to
take
the
ultimate
weapon
and
strike.
but
it
contemplates
in
the
first
instance
some
attempt
to
resolve
disputes.
the
words
mutual
protection
do
not
refer
to
protection
against
working
condition
and
it
is
submitted.
if
there
is
an
abnormally
dangerous
working
condition,
the
employee
is
fully
protected
by
section
502
of
the
act
which
states
that
if
they
quit
in
good
faith
because
of
abnormally
dangerous
conditions
per
work
at
the
place
of
employment,
this
quitting
shall
not
be
deemed
to
strike
under
the
act.
in
other
words,
this
definition
confirms
our
thesis
namely
that
when
an
employees
walkout
without
making
a
demand
or
without
conferring
with
their
employer
in
any
way.
but,
because
of
some
dangerous
condition
of
work,
this
is
not
a
strike
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word.
a
strike
contemplates
the
ultimate
weapon
following
a
demand
upon
the
employer
or
a
concession
and
a
refusal
by
the
employer
to
concede.
now,
i
say
that
protecting
an
unannounced
walkout
of
the
nature
we
have
here
will
not
effectuate
the
policies
of
this
act.
and
then
unless
a
reinstatement
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
that
cannot
be
ordered
under
section
10
(c).
mr.
robert
r.
bair
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
r.
bair
the
--
with
reference
to
the
complaints
about
the
cold,
i
have
already
addressed
myself
to.
mr.
robert
r.
bair
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
bair
i
understand
your
honor
and
i
agree
with
you.
but
the
evidence
must
be
evidence
of
a
serious
complaint,
evidence
of
something
more
than
a
topic
of
conversation
it
seems
to
me.
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
robert
r.
bair
well,
that
is
so
your
honor,
but
--
but
that
was
a
very
special
day,
occasioned
by
very
special
circumstance.
the
previous
complaints
were
not
complaints
with
reference
to
a
day
when
the
furnace
was
not
operating.
the
so-called
complaints,
i
do
not
admit
that
they
were
complaints.
the
general
counsel
asked
them
questions
using
the
word
complaints.
they
replied
in
terms
of
--
i
talked
about
the
cold
or
remarked
about
it
or
asked
about
it.
that
is
--
that
is
our
position
your
honor
that
the
evidence
was
not
of
the
sort
that
could
support
a
current
labor
dispute.
in
other
words,
a
controversy
between
capital
and
labor
over
a
cold
working
condition,
it
just
does
not
take
that
status.
mr.
robert
r.
bair
well
your
honor,
in
that
situation,
i
fall
back
on
the
other
phase
of
the
argument
that
even
if
there
is,
even
if
you
can
say
that
this
is
a
current
labor
dispute,
you
still
have
to
look
to
the
reasons
for
the
discharge
which
are,
the
right
to
discharge
for
cause
being
protected
by
section
10
(c).
and
you
have
to
try
to
reconcile
the
employer's
right
to
discharge
under
10
(c)
with
the
employees'
right
to
take
concerted
action
under
section
7.
the
motives
of
the
employer
in
discharging
these
men
cannot
be
laid
to
a
scheme
to
coerce
or
intimidate
these
men
or
to
interfere
with
their
rights
to
take
collective
action.
the
employer
would
have
taken
this
action
whether
it
was
by
one
man
or
three
or
seven.
the
employer's
motives
behind
the
discharge
have
long
been
looked
at
by
this
court
in
other
cases,
and
the
power
of
the
employer
to
discharge
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
time
and
again,
jones
&
laughlin,
the
fansteel
case,
they
all
advert
to
the
fact
that
the
wagner
act
does
not
interfere
with
the
right
of
the
employer
to
select
and
discharge
his
men.
it
does
interfere
with
his
right
only
when
by
doing
so.
he
is
trying
to
interfere
with
their
rights
under
section
7.
and
finally,
the
rights
under
section
7
being
protected
are
not
rights
to
take
any
kind
of
action
but
their
rights
to
take
concerted
action
directed
towards
the
policies
of
the
act,
