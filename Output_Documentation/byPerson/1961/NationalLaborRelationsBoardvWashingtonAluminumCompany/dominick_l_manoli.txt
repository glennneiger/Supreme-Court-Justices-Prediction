mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit.
the
labor
board
found
in
this
case
that
the
respondent
company
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
discharging
seven
employees
who
had
concertedly
walked
out
of
the
plant
in
protest
against
inadequate
heating
of
the
machine
shop
in
which
they
were
employed.
the
board's
order
requires
the
respondent
company
to
offer
reinstatement
of
these
employees
with
back
pay.
the
court
below
set
aside
the
board's
order.
it
concluded
that
the
walkout,
the
concerted
walkout
was
not
concerted
activity
within
the
protection
of
the
statute
and
that
therefore,
the
discharge
does
not
violate
of
the
act
because
the
employees,
prior
to
the
walkout,
had
failed
to
make
a
demand
upon
the
employer
to
correct
the
objectionable
conditions.
the
question
presented
is
whether
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
there
is
award
in
the
statute
for
the
interposition
of
such
a
condition
precedent
to
the
employees'
exercise
of
their
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
i
shall
briefly
summarize
the
basic
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
controversy.
the
respondent
company
operates
a
plant
in
baltimore,
maryland
where
it
is
engaged
in
the
fabrication
of
aluminum
products.
and
in
connection
with
this
plant,
it
operates
a
machine
shop.
the
day
shift
on
the
machine
--
on
the
machine
shop
consists
of
a
foreman
and
eight
employees.
and
at
the
time
of
the
events
that
gave
rise
to
this
controversy,
these
employees
were
not
represented
by
a
union
nor
was
there
in
effect
any
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
provided
for
machinery
for
the
handling
of
grievances.
the
shop
is
approximately
40
x
75
feet.
it
is
not
insulated.
it
has
a
number
of
doors
which
open
to
the
outside
and
during
working
time,
these
doors
are
open
by
frequently.
the
shop
is
principally
heated
--
principally
heated
by
large
gas
furnace
and
to
--
by
a
large
oil
furnace
rather,
by
large
oil
furnace
and
two
much
smaller
gas
furnaces.
sometime
prior
to
the
walkout
here
in
question,
the
employees
complained
about
the
coldness
of
the
shop
in
the
winter
time.
on
january
5th,
1959,
a
monday
morning,
the
employees
of
the
machine
shop
reported
at
the
plant
some
time
between
7
and
7:30.
that
particular
morning
was
extremely
cold
and
for
baltimore,
an
abnormally
cold
day,
cold
morning.
an
anticipation
of
the
heat,
the
night
watchmen
had
been
at
the
plant
at
1
o'clock
that
morning
--
1
o'clock
monday
morning,
and
again
at
5
o'clock
that
morning
and
had
sought
to
start
the
furnaces,
but
he
was
unable
to
start
the
large
furnace,
and
the
large
furnace
is
the
one
that
is
the
source
of
--
the
primary
source
of
heat
for
the
machine
shop.
when
the
employees
reported
at
work,
as
i
say
between
7
and
7:30,
they
found
the
shop
extremely
cold.
and
one
of
the
employees,
caron,
went
into
the
foreman
jarvis'
office
in
order
to
get
warmed
but
found
that
his
office
was
just
as
cold
as
the
rest
of
the
shop.
while
he
and
foreman
jarvis
were
discussing
the
cold
in
the
shop,
foreman
jarvis
saw
a
couple
of
employees,
as
the
record
puts
it,
all
huddled
up
near
the
doorway,
and
jarvis
remarked
to
caron,
"if
those
fellow
had
any
guts,
they
would
go
home."
caron
reported
this
statement
to
his
fellow
employees
and
they
discussed
it
among
themselves,
and
they
decided
to
go
home.
there's
one
employee
who
testified
and
answered
the
question,
"why
did
you
leave
the
plant
on
monday
morning
with
these
other
men?"
i'm
reading
it
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
43
of
the
record.
his
answer
was,
"well,
they
said
it
was
extremely
cold,
and
we
had
all
got
together
and
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
go
home.
maybe
we
could
get
some
heat
brought
into
the
plant
that
way."
now,
seven
of
the
eight
employees,
as
i
say,
had
decided
to
go
home,
and
as
they
were
leaving,
jarvis
and
perhaps
one
or
two
of
the
employees,
or
rather
caron.
as
they
were
leaving,
caron,
one
of
the
employees
remarked
to
foreman
jarvis
that
they
were
going
home,
they
were
leaving,
it
was
too
cold.
they
walked
out
at
approximately
the
time
that
the
7:30
whistle
which
blew
the
--
which
marked
the
--
the
start
of
working
day,
the
time
that
whistle
blew.
only
one
of
the
eight
employees
decided
to
remain
and
apparently
the
record
suggest
that
he
was
an
alien
and
feared
that
because
he
was
an
alien,
he
might
have
difficulty
obtaining
other
employment.
meanwhile
--
meanwhile,
the
company's
electrician
had
fixed
the
furnace,
probably
some
switch
there
hadn't
been
put
on.
he
fixed
the
furnace
and
within
a
few
minutes
after
7:30,
the
furnace
was
operating
but
the
temperature
in
this
machine
shop
did
not
reach
normal
until
nearly
noon
at
that
day.
about
an
hour
later
after
the
men
had
walked
out
of
the
plant,
the
company's
president
appeared
at
the
plant.
and
when
he
discovered
what
had
happened,
he
ordered
the
seven
men
to
be
discharged
because
he
said,
"they
had
left
without
permission."
notice
was
given
to
the
very
--
to
the
seven
men,
either
by
telephone
or
by
telegram,
that
particular
day
that
they
were
discharged.
in
a
very
short
time
of
the
decision
to
discharge
them,
one
of
the
employees
came
back
and
apparently
indicated
that
he
was
prepared
to
go
back
to
work
but
the
company
said,
"no,
that
they
won't
take
him
back."
and
on
the
next
day
or
two,
one
or
two
other
employees
also
indicated
the
desire
to
return
to
work
but
again
the
company
refused
to
reconsider
its
decision.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
the
same
day.
that's
right
and
all
of
the
parties
were
notified
on
the
day
of
the
walkout.
that's
correct.
now,
as
i
said,
the
court
below
disagreeing
with
the
board
concluded
that
this
walkout,
this
concerted
stoppage
of
work
by
these
employees
was
not
concerted
activity
within
the
protection
of
the
statute
because
these
employees
had
failed
prior
to
the
walkout
to
make
a
demand
upon
the
employer
to
correct
the
objectionable
conditions.
the
court
below
did
not
set
aside
the
board's
additional
findings
that
these
people
had
complained
about
the
coldness
of
the
shop
in
the
winter
time
sometime
before
the
walkout.
but
it
is
kind
of
these
complaints
on
the
ground
that
these
complaints
had
not
been
coupled
with
a
specific
demand
that
the
employer
do
something
about
it.
now,
in
our
judgment
and
the
board's
judgment,
we
believe
that
neither
the
basic
--
neither
the
specific
provisions
of
the
statute
nor
its
basic
policies
warrant
the
imposition
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
of
such
a
condition
present
to
the
employer's
exercise
of
their
section
7
rights,
namely,
the
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activities
for
mutual
aid
and
protection.
now,
the
starting
point
of
our
analysis,
i
think
is
section
7
of
the
act
and
section
8
(a)
(1).
section
7
of
the
act
provides
that
the
employer
shall
have
the
right
to
engage
in
collective
bar
--
to
engage
in
concerted
activities
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
or
other
mutual
aid
or
protection.
section
8
(a)
(1)
makes
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
interfere
with,
coerce
or
restrain
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
section
7
right.
now,
i
think
there
can
be
very
little
question
that
the
walkout
in
this
case
certainly
satisfies
the
literal
language
of
section
7.
it
was
the
concerted
action
of
seven
employees.
it
wasn't
protest
against
objectionable
working
conditions
and
hence
for
their
mutual
aid
or
protection.
and
i
venture
to
say
--
i
venture
to
say
that
the
walkout
here
is
the
most
elementary
form
of
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
and
protection
and
that
the
walkout
here
represents
nothing
more
than
a
simple
exercise
of
the
employee's
right
to
engage
in
a
concerted
stoppage
of
work
for
the
purpose
of
objecting
to
a
--
to
conditions
of
work
that
they
don't
want
or
like.
and
it
would
seem
to
follow
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir,
there
was
not.
they
were
not
represented
either
by
union
and
there
was
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
effect.
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
the
employer's
discharge
in
this
case
is
the
plaintiff
sort
of
interference
and
restraint
of
employees
in
the
exercise
of
section
7
rights.
now,
i
am
aware,
i'm
aware
if
the
court
please
that
the
courts,
both
the
board
and
the
courts
have
held
that
not
all
conduct,
not
all
the
employees
self-helped
which
falls
within
the
literal
scope
of
section
7,
necessarily
enjoys
its
protection.
both
the
board
and
the
courts
have
held
at
that
section
and
that
be
read
literally
so
as
to
minimize
all
conduct
which
falls
within
its
literal
scope
without
regard
either
that
means
or
the
opposite.
both
the
board
and
the
courts
including
this
one,
have
held
that
concerted
activity
may
lose
the
protection
of
the
statute
where
either
--
either
where
its
object
is
in
contravention
of
a
specific
provision
of
the
statute,
our
statute,
or
its
basic
policy,
or
the
provisions
of
some
related
federal
statute
or
--
or
whether
means
used,
even
though
for
a
lawful
act
are
so
egregiously
incompatible
with
the
recognized
standards
of
conduct
in
employer-employee
relationships
as
to
be
deemed
indefensible.
now,
i
submit
your
honors
that
this
case
does
not
fall
within
any
of
those
categories.
the
court
below
sought
to
anchor
its
decision
in
this
case
here
upon
the
policy
of
the
statute
which
fosters
the
peaceful
resolution
of
industrial
disputes
through
collective
bargaining
and
through
negotiation.
and
the
court
felt
here
that
the
failure
of
the
employees
to
go
through
the
formality
of
making
a
prior
demand
upon
the
employer
before
they
walked
out
was
in
derogation
of
this
policy.
now,
of
course
it's
true
that
if
employers
make
a
prior
demand
upon
the
employer
to
correct
objection
of
the
conditions,
it
may
be
conducive
to
the
peaceful
resolution
of
that
dispute.
but
to
say
as
the
court
below
apparently
thought,
to
say
that
there's
an
inconsistency
between
strike
action,
concerted
work
stoppages
and
the
statutory
policy
of
fostering
the
peaceful
resolution
of
industrial
disputes
by
negotiation
and
for
--
because
the
employers
have
not
gone
through
the
formality
of
making
a
prior
demand,
i
submit
that
your
honor,
that
to
say
that,
to
say
that
there's
an
inconsistency
between
the
two
is
to
misconceive,
is
to
misconceive
the
place
of
strike
action
and
work
stoppages
in
the
statutory
scheme.
as
this
court
said
in
the
insurance
agent's
case,
the
right
to
engage
in
work
stoppages
for
mutual
aid
or
protection,
the
right
to
engage
into
strikes
was
not
a
grudging
exception
to
the
statutory
policy
of
fostering
the
peaceful
resolution
of
industrial
disputes.
it
was
part
impartial
of
it
as
indicated
by
section
7,
by
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
section
8
--
and
section
13
of
the
statute
which
in
some
brought
in
to
protect
the
right
of
the
employers
to
engage
in
concerted
activities,
and
immunize
the
right
to
strike
except
as
specifically
provided
otherwise
in
the
statute.
congress
has
seen
no
inconsistency
between
work
stoppage
or
strike
action
and
the
policy
of
the
statute
of
the
peaceful
resolution
of
disputes,
just
because
the
employers
had
not
made
a
prior
demand
and
there
is
no
provision.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
don't
think
we
have
a
fact
issue
in
here
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
substantially
basic
facts
are
undisputed.
i
do
think
that
we
make
it
into
a
question
about
where
the
board
has
made
an
accommodation
between
competing
interests
within
the
framework
of
the
statute
on
how
much
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
--
we
don't
believe
that
universal
camera
is
involved
in
this
case.
now,
there's
no
provision
in
the
statute
which
requires
the
employees
to
make
a
demand
upon
the
employer
before
they
engage
in
a
strike
or
on
a
walkout
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
the
only
exception
to
this
is
section
8
(d)
of
the
statute.
and
section
8
(d)
provides
for
what
has
been
called
the
cooling-off
period,
but
this
provision
applies
only
where
there
is
in
effect
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
price
have
given
notice
to
terminate
or
modify
it.
well,
that
is
the
situation
and
that
is
not
the
situation
here
of
course,
then
the
parties,
the
employment
may
not
lock
up.
now,
the
employers
may
go
out
on
strike
without
having
given
certain
notices
and
engage
and
had
--
and
have
to
have
this
cooling-off
period.
i
say
we
have
nothing
like
that
here.
now,
it
may
well
be
--
it
may
well
be,
there
will
be
that
spontaneous
work
stoppage
such
as
in
this
case,
may
be
the
most
effective
method
that
the
employers
have
at
hand
for
compelling
the
employer
to
alleviate
objectionable
working
conditions.
and
again,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
insurance
agents,
the
fact
that
peaceful
self-help
by
employees
maximizes
the
pressure
upon
the
employer
to
do
something
about
it,
about
the
conditions
that
they
are
objecting
to
does
not
necessarily
make
those
self
--
does
not
make
those
self-help
activities
run
it
counter
to
the
statutory
policy
of
collective
bargaining
or
a
fostering
the
peaceful
resolution
of
industrial
disputes
by
negotiation.
now,
there
may
be
situations
--
there
may
be
situations
where
the
broad
section
7
rights
may
have
to
be
accommodated
to
some
legitimate
employer
interest.
for
example,
both
the
board
and
the
courts
have
held
that
where
you
have
a
spontaneous
workout
--
a
spontaneous
walkout
which
may
create
a
hazardous
condition
of
the
plant
or
may
endanger
its
safety
that
the
employees
may
lose
the
protection
of
the
statute
under
those
circumstances.
or
you
may
have
a
situation
like
the
third
circuit
had
in
condenser,
a
number
of
years
ago.
number
of
years
ago
where
the
employer
had
promised
the
employees
that
he
would
hear
them
--
hear
their
grievance
at
the
end
of
the
working
day
and
they
acquiesce
in
this
but
subsequently
then
just
walked
out
of
the
place.
here,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
said,
"well,
they
had
given
an
implied
promise
that
they
would
wait
until
they
had
--
or
would
hear
them
as
he
had
promised
to
do
it."
but
we
have
nothing
like
that
in
this
case.
there
was
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
this
case.
there
was
no
promise
to
hear
these
people,
there
was
no
union
involved
in
the
case.
the
employees
had
made
--
they
hadn't
be
--
made
complaints,
they
hadn't
made
complaints
about
the
coldness
of
the
plant
some
time
prior
to
the
particular
walkout
here
while
the
court
below
discounted
these
complaints
on
the
--
on
the
ground
that
they
were
not
coupled
with
specific
demand
that
the
employer
do
something
about
it.
i
suggest
that
that
view
is
rather
hyper
technical.
when
the
employers
appeared
at
the
plant
on
this
morning,
the
condition
there
were
intolerable
and
was
the
most
natural
thing
on
the
--
on
earth
for
them
just
think
that
work
was
out
of
the
question
and
for
them
to
go
home.
now,
the
employer,
at
all
times,
knew
why
the
employees
had
walked
out.
he'd
knew
why
they
had
walked
out,
when
he
discharged
them.
it
knew
what
it
had
to
do
in
order
to
bring
them
back.
it
could've
notified
them
that
the
furnace
was
in
operation
and
that
the
plant
would
be
heated
--
would
be
--
would
be
heated
up,
normal
temperatures
by
noon,
but
instead,
what
did
it
do?
it
summarily
fired
them.
now,
we
are
told
--
we
are
told
that
the
walkout
here
interrupted
critical
production
of
this
--
all
that
we're
--
the
evidence,
the
right
of
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
there
was
some
one
item
that
was
supposed
to
go
out,
it's
an
unspecified
item.
the
testimony
is
it
was
supposed
to
go
out
that
day,
and
the
other
thing
was
that
two
people
were
taken
from
some
other
jobs
and
put
in
the
machine
shop.
now,
i
venture
to
suggest
your
honors,
that
whatever
disruption
there
was
here
for
production
at
best,
at
best
was
no
more
than
what
it
would
be
incidental
of
any
strike
or
work
stoppage.
now,
weighing
these
factors
--
weighing
these
factors,
the
board
concluded
--
the
board
concluded
that
the
failure
of
the
employer,
the
omission
of
the
employees
to
make
it
--
close
with
the
formality
of
making
a
prior
demand
upon
the
employer
to
correct
the
objection
or
conditions
was
insufficient.
it
was
insufficient
in
the
circumstance
of
this
case
to
award
a
forfeiture
of
the
right
to
which
otherwise
entitle
to
under
the
statute.
this
court
has
said
that
where
an
accommodation
must
be
made,
must
be
made
between
competing
interest
within
the
statutory
framework
but
the
primary
responsibility
for
making
these
accommodations
is
--
lies
with
the
board,
and
that
the
court
should
respect
that
kind
of
an
accommodation
unless
it's
unreasonable.
we
think
that
the
court
below
lost
sight
of
this
principle
when
it
upset
the
board's
judgment
of
this
case.
basically,
it
seems
to
me,
the
court
below
has
made
its
decision
with
respect
to
the
legality
of
the
walkout
here,
turn
upon
its
notion
that
there
was
something
unfair
about
it.
something
unfair
about
it
because
the
failure
of
the
furnace
to
work,
the
mechanical
failure
of
--
of
furnace
to
work
was
of
something
of
opportunity
and
that
the
furnace
was
in
operation
within
a
few
minutes
after
the
employees
had
walked
out.
but
both
the
board
and
the
courts
i
think
properly
so
had
been
weary.
they've
been
weary
of
conditioning
the
exercise
of
section
7
rights
upon
their
individual
notions
as
to
what
is
wise
or
fair
or
proper.
indeed,
as
long
it
goes
1938,
this
court
said
in
the
mackay
case
that
the
wisdom
or
unwisdom,
the
justification
or
the
lack
of
justification
of
the
employees
may
have
in
engaging
in
concerted
activity
is
normally
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
illegality
of
that
activity.
and
to
hold
otherwise,
to
hold
otherwise
would
present
the
very
serious
danger
of
resurrecting
the
discredited
common
law
of
conspiracy
doctrine
under
which
such
is
decided
whether
act
--
concerted
action
by
employees
was
legal
or
not
legal
under
basis
--
their
own
individual
views
as
to
what
was
fair,
desirable
or
wise.
this
philosophy,
we
believe
runs
counter
to
the
philosophy
of
the
federal
labor
policy
as
reflected
not
only
in
the
norris-laguardia
statute
but
in
our
statute
as
well.
of
course,
the
court
below
--
the
court
below
was
not
so
unmindful
of
history
as
to
phrase
this
decision
in
terms
of
fairness
or
wisdom,
but
we
think
that
that
was
the
inevitable
and
we
submit
that
it
was
wrong.
it
was
wrong
for
it
to
have
overruled
the
board's
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
the
court
has
no
questions,
i
have
no
further
to
add.
