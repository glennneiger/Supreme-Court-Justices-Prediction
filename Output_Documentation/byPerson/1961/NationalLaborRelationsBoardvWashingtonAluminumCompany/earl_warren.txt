chief

what
do
you
do
mr.
bair
with
the
finding
of
the
board
as
quoted
by
mr.
chief
judge
sobeloff
in
his
opinion
on
124
of
the
record
where
he
says,
"the
trial
examiner
found,
and
we
agree,
that
the
respondent
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
in
terminating
the
employment
of
seven
complainants
who
were
engaged
in
protected
concerted
activity
under
the
act.
we
rely,
inter
alia,
upon
the
following.
the
credited
testimony
of
the
employee
hovis,
that,
"we
all
got
together
and
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
go
home.
maybe
we
could
get
some
heat
brought
into
the
plant
that
way."
the
credited
testimony
of
the
employees
heinlein,
caron
and
george
as
to
previous
complaints
made
to
the
respondent's
foreman
over
the
cold
working
conditions,
and
to
the
effect
that
the
men
left
on
the
morning
january
5th
in
protest
to
the
coldness
at
the
plant,
and
the
evidence
of
the
seven
complainants
left
the
shop
at
approximately
the
same
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
have,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
hasn't
the
board
some
discretion
in
determining
whether
a
matter
--
a
thing
is
a
complaint
or
a
mere
--
mere
casual
discretion?
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
violent
complaint
surely
it
doesn't,
in
order
to
represent
a
complaint
against
cold
conditions.
otherwise,
the
more
--
the
more
general
the
men
were,
the
more
considerate
they
were
in
their
conduct,
the
less
rights
they
would
have.
they
don't
have
to
--
they
don't
have
to
do
it
in
a
turbulent
manner,
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
suppose
if
they
called
it
to
the
attention
repeatedly
of
their
foreman
who
represents
the
employers
that
the
board
would
at
least
have
the
right,
would
it
not,
to
consider
those
things
as
complaints
particularly
when
it
got
down
to
15
degrees,
that's
pretty
cold
for
people
to
work
in
without
the
heat?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
board
have
--
would
the
board
have
a
little
more
discretion
in
determining
whether
these
were
complaints
or
not
but
we're
dealing
with
unorganized
men
who
have
no
one
to
represent
them
on
the
other
hand
where
they
have
a
union
with
a
shop
steward
whose
duty
it
was
to
carry
complaints
to
the
management?
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
you
think
that
it
could
be
a
little
less
formal
when
you're
dealing
with
men
who
are
not
organized
and
who
might
on
the
rule
not
want
to
go
and
complain
literally
to
the
employer
but
who
would
and
--
well
as
he
could
call
it
--
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
--
of
the
owner
that
it
was
too
cold
to
work
in
and
so
forth
and
then
finally
that
they
have
(inaudible)
for
these
15
of
the
men
might
be
seriously
injured
in
their
health,
they
all
get
together
and
say,
"we'll
go
home.
maybe
we
can
--
maybe
we
can
have
the
situation
remedied."
