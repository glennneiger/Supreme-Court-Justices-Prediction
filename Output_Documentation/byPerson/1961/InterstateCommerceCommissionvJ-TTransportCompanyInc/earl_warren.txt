mr.
taylor,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
might
there
not
be
a
difference
between
the
commission
saying
that
u.s.a.c.
can
supply
all
of
the
needs
of
the
shipper
from
saying
that
it
can
do
all
of
the
things
for
the
shipper
that
the
private
or
the
contract
carrier
could
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
there
a
difference?
are
they
not
there
deciding
what
they
think
the
shipper
needs
rather
than
to
say
that
they
can
do
just
as
much
for
him
as
the
contract
carrier?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
this
act
contemplate
competition
between
public
carriers
and
private
carriers
in
this
field?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i'm
--
i'm
speaking
with
contractors,
or
is
it
just
between
rail
and
water
and
trucks
or
does
it
break
it
down
farther
and
does
it
contemplate
the
competition
in
this
field
between
public
truckers
and
contractors?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
mr.
taylor.
chief
justice

(inaudible)

mr.
solomon.
chief
justice

warren
to
support
either
way
or
both
ways?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
was
it
--
excuse
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wrape.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
testing
carrier
have
comparable
equipment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
evidence
to
counteract
what
you
have
just
read
to
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
stands
uncontradicted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.

is
mr.
rice
or
mr.
ginnane
first?
yes
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
commission
propose
to
hear
parties
on
that
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
a
testimony
contrary
to
this
that
you
pointed
out
to
us
here
on
195,
196
and
197?
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
mr.
rice
will
address
himself
to
the
lower
rates
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we've
got
time
now,
haven't
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
the
fact
that
the
common
carrier
rates
were
not
unreasonable
prove
that
the
private
carrier
or
contract
carrier
could
not
reasonably
do
it
cheaper
and
therefore
better
supply
the
needs
of
the
shipper.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understood
here
--
but
i
understood
from
mr.
ginnane
that
it
wasn't
identical
service
that
these
men
could
distribute
to
six,
seven
or
eight
more
people
on
its
trip
but
that
a
common
carrier
couldn't
do
more
than
two
or
at
the
utmost
three.
now
that's
quite
a
--
there's
quite
a
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
said
there
was
a
substantial
difference
and
undoubtedly
that
that
would
result
in
the
benefit
to
the
shipper.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solomon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
the
other
side
has
about
two
minutes
if
it
wishes
to
use
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
thank
you.
