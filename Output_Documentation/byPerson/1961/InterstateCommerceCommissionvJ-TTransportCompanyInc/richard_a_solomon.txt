mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
in
a
very
brief
period
that
i
have
in
this
argument,
i
don't
think
i'll
have
time
to
do
more
than
outline
our
position.
but
the
issues
presented
in
this
case
are
also
presented
in
the
reddish
case
is
to
follow
and
i
may
be
able
to
elaborate
there.
now,
with
due
respect
to
my
friends
on
the
appellee
side,
i'm
not
going
to
take
any
time
here
to
argue
the
question
of
whether
the
commission
can't
consider
adequacy
of
service
or
consider
the
service
that
the
common
carriers
and
other
protesters
here
provide.
i
think
the
lower
court's
decision
in
both
this
case
and
the
reddish
case
are
very
ambiguous
on
this
point.
and
i
agree
strongly
with
the
commission
that
they
should
be
clarified
in
this
court's
opinion.
but
i
don't
really
think
that
there's
any
serious
problem.
if
the
court
was
saying,
if
they
can't
consider,
it
was
clearly
wrong,
they
have
to
consider
the
existing
services.
you
can't
make
a
determination
that
makes
any
sense
without
knowing
what
you're
starting.
the
problem
we
have
is
not
whether
you
consider
existing
services,
but
how
you
consider
existing
services
in
evaluating
the
two
primary
questions
which
normally
are
going
to
be
decisive
in
this
type
of
case.
now,
as
justice
frankfurter
said,
there
are
five
factors
which
the
commission
is
required
to
consider
and
there
are
additional
factors
because
i
agree
with
the
commission
that
these
are
not
exclusive
factors.
there
may
be
other
factors,
which
the
record
will
require
them
to
consider.
but
in
most
cases,
in
most
cases,
the
problem
really
comes
down
to
whether
the
interest
of
the
shipper
in
securing
new
service
are
more
important
to
the
national
transportation
policy
or
less
important
to
the
national
transportation
policy
than
the
interest
of
the
existing
carriers
in
protecting
their
services,
the
choice
is
between
the
effect,
in
other
words,
if
i
may
cite,
use
statutory
language
between
the
effect
of
a
denial
of
the
application
upon
the
shippers
for
whom
it
is
being
put
forward
because
contract
carrier
applications
are
always
put
forward
by
a
proposed
contract
shipper,
a
transporter
for
specific
shippers.
the
shipper's
interest
as
contrasted
with
the
interest
of
the
existing
carriers.
now,
as
we
see
it,
and
as
the
court
below
saw
it
too,
in
passing
upon
these
two
basic
factors,
there
are
three
problems
which
have
risen
over
the
years
and
which
are
exemplified
in
both
the
j-t
and
the
reddish
cases,
which
are
very
important.
the
first
of
which,
to
which
i'll
only
advert
very
briefly
here
is
burden
of
proof.
the
commission
has
used
very
loose
language
in
the
past.
it
uses
very
loose
language
here
with
respect
to
whether
the
shipper
or
the
applicant
must
show
that
the
protesting
carriers
are
unwilling
and
unable
to
do
what
they
intend
to
do.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
commission
puts
the
burden
upon
the
shipper
and
the
applicant
to
show
what
somebody
else
can
do,
not
only
is
that
illogical
but
it's
clearly
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
of
1957
amendments
because
the
commission
at
that
time
tried
to
put
through
an
amendment
which
would've
put
the
burden
on
the
applicants
and
that
was
expressly
rejected.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
showing
that
they're
unwilling
or
unable
to
provide.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
it
does,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
think
a
lot
of
things
can
be
drawn
from
their
experience
and
i
think
even
they
can
--
from
their
experience
say,
generally
speaking
we
are
going
to
look
with
great
disfavor
upon
contract
carrier
applications
unless
there
is
a
real
unmeetable
need,
because
we
know
generally
speaking
that
this
will
effect
the
existing
common
carriers.
but
the
problems
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
the
1957
act,
in
part
because
that
contract
carriers'
complaint
that
they
were
doing
this
too
generally
and
not
looking
at
the
specific
facts,
it
requires
them
to
look
at
the
specific
facts
and
apply
their
general
test
to
the
specific
facts
of
the
case.
now,
as
putting
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
the
real
problem
here
is
whether
they
do
make
their
generalizations
conclusive.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
the
generalizations
are
perfectly
well
tools
to
help
you
in
reaching
in
a
decision
but
they
are
not
a
substitute
for
a
decision.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
from
my
point,
i
must
confess
completed
wherein
--
that's
why
we
didn't
decide
that.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
united
states,
despite
what
it
may
seem
like
because
we
sometimes
do
come
up
here
opposing
the
commission
does
not
like
to
and
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
recognizing
exactly
what
you
were
saying,
we
have,
although
we
think
there
is
some
basis
for
the
lower
court's
opinion
here,
we
have
leaned
over
backwards
to
say
that
in
our
opinion,
on
the
basis
of
the
record
of
the
j-t
case,
we
don't
have
to
say
this
in
reddish,
we're
in
the
basis
of
the
j-t
case,
we
do
think
that
the
commission
can
be
said
to
have
found
that
j-t
can
fully
and
completely
meet
the
distinct
needs
of
the
shipper
here.
now,
this
is
debatable,
but
we
think
that,
as
we
look
at
the
record
here
that
this
is
a
conclusion
that
they
not
only
could've
drawn,
but
that
the
language
would
seem
to
say
they
drew
it
outweighs
the
language,
which
seems
to
indicate
they
didn't.
this
isn't
a
clear
problem
even
in
the
j-t
case
your
honor,
because
not
only
does
the
commission
in
its
general
discussion
at
pages
38
of
the
record,
talk
in
terms
of
shipper
needs
being
merely
met
by
reasonably
adequate
service
of
the
common
carriers,
exactly
the
type
of
showing,
which
this
court
and
the
schaffer
found
was
no
--
not
sufficient.
but
on
page
49
of
the
record,
it
again
talks
in
terms
of,
whereas
here
it
appears
that
a
motor
common
carrier
is
able
to
furnish
a
service
substantially
similar
to
that
proposed
by
a
motor
carrier
--
by
a
motor
common
carrier
applicant.
so
there
is
this
problem
in
the
j-t
case
as
well
as
the
reddish
case.
but
we
agree
with
mr.
taylor
that
when
you
look
at
this
decision
on
the
whole
here,
there
is
enough
in
here
to
find
that
the
commission
filed
that
the
existing
carrier
could
fully
meet
the
needs
of
the
shipper
and
that
they're
sufficient
on
the
record
so
that
in
the
very
broad
leeway
that
the
commission
must
necessarily
have,
this
is
supportive.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
mean
by
distinctive
needs,
sir
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission
seems
to
think
it
means
that
too
because
the
commission
does
use
the
words
“distinctive
needs”
in
the
j-t
case.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir,
the
203
(a)
(15),
in
defining
common
carrier
uses
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
mean
contract
carrier,
uses
the
term
distinct
needs
of
the
shipper
and
it
is
that
--
for
that
reason,
that
the
lower
courts
picked
up
this
term.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
there's
a
--
all
the
difference
in
the
word.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
problem
in
all
too
many
cases,
the
problem
in
the
reddish
case
is
that
in
evaluating
the
needs
of
the
shipper,
one
of
the
statutory
things
that
they
must
evaluate
all
too
often,
the
commission
says
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
needs
of
the
shippers
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
but
what
209
says
is,
“you
must
evaluate
the
effect
of
a
denial
upon
the
shipper.”
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
which
means,
i
believe
and
i
think
must
necessarily
mean,
that
what
will
a
shipper
lose
in
the
way
of
transportation
if
this
application
is
denied,
which
necessarily
means
what
does
he
need,
because
what
if
--
you'll
now
determine
what
he
loses.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
now,
all
too
often
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
sure.
but
it's
not
only
that,
it's
a
question
of
what
are
the
specific
needs,
because
all
too
frequently
justice
frankfurter,
what
the
commission
does
is
it
looks
at
the
common
carriers
and
says,
“they
can
perform
the
general
type
of
service
that
is
asked
for
here.”
if
it's
--
well,
they
say
here,
these
are
both
specialized
carriers.
they
can
both
perform
the
same
general
type
of
service.
now,
if
they
stop
there,
as
we
think
they
did
in
reddish,
we
think
that
would
be
clearly
wrong.
it
would
be
exactly
what
the
commission
did
in
the
schaffer
transportation
case,
at
355,
where
they
said
the
railroads
can
get
these
granite
blocks
from
vermont
to
the
midwest,
they
can
provide
a
reasonably
adequate
service
and
they
didn't
look
to
see
that
--
a
reasonably
adequate
service
may
not
meet
the
full
needs
of
the
shippers.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
this
is
a
very
real
problem
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
this
is
“words.”
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
this
is
“words”
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
but
it's
more
than
that.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
that's
what
--
that's
what
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
disagree.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
all
too
frequently,
the
commission
has
used
this
phrase
“reasonably
adequate,”
as
this
court
found
in
the
schaffer
case,
has
used
this
convenient
term
“reasonably
adequate”
to
say
that
the
protesting
carriers
are
doing
something
equivalent
generally
to
what
the
shipper
needs
and
that's
good
enough,
and
we
won't
consider
the
shipper
needs
anymore.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i'll
give
you
a
more
specific
case
because
it's
the
case
i'm
going
to
argue
next.
in
the
reddish
case,
both
the
protestants
and
the
applicant
can
provide
multiple
pickup
and
delivery
service
of
small
orders
and
that's
true.
and
to
that
extent,
they
are
--
the
protestants
can
provide
reasonably
adequate
service,
but
that's
not
the
issue.
the
issue
in
reddish
is
whether
the
protestants
can
provide
this
type
of
service
as
fast
and
as
efficiently,
and
that
the
commission
doesn't
pay
any
attention
to.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
think
on
the
same
wavelength.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
problem
here
and
in
all
these
commission
cases
is
that
in
all
too
many
of
them,
they
have
used
a
formula
rather
than
looking
at
the
facts
to
see
distinct
needs.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
they
have
used
lose
language
to
avoid
doing
their
job.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
agree
sir
that
we
have
to
look
at
what
is
behind
the
words
and
not
merely
at
the
work.
and
that
--
let
me
turn
in
connection
with
to
this
problem.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
burden
of
showing
the
distinct
needs
of
the
shipper
are
upon
the
shipper
or
the
applicant
who
wishes
to
serve
it.
the
burden
of
showing
whether
they
can
be
met
by
the
protestant
carriers
is
on
the
protesting
carriers.
now,
i
would
like
to
get,
if
i
have
any
time
at
all,
to
the
question
of
presumption,
which
is
the
place
which
in
the
specific
facts
of
the
j-t
case,
we
part
company
with
the
commission.
now,
as
i
say
in
most
cases
and
in
the
j-t
case,
the
problem
is
evaluating
shipper
needs
against
the
needs
of
the
--
against
the
interest
of
the
existing
carriers.
and
the
statute,
the
1957
amendment
next
express
what
we
think
was
implied
previously
and
that
is
that
the
commission
must
consider
the
effect
of
a
grant
upon
the
services
--
upon
the
services
of
the
existing
protesting
carriers.
our
problem
with
the
commission
is
that
it
doesn't
make
any
effort
in
any
case
or
at
least
in
these
two
cases,
maybe
it
makes
some
effort
in
some
cases
mr.
todd
may
mention.
but
in
these
two
cases,
it
makes
no
effort
to
look
and
see
what
the
real
effect
of
this
grant
is
going
to
be
upon
the
protesting
shippers.
it
doesn't
look
to
the
problems
that
mr.
rice
mentioned
about
the
empty
trucks
of
u.s.a.c.
it
doesn't
look
to
what
u.s.a.c.'s
financial
position
is.
it
doesn't
look
to
whether
this
grant
would
really
affect
u.s.a.c.'s
ability
to
continue
its
services
for
its
public
just
as
efficiently
as
if
it
didn't
make
the
grant.
all
it
does
is
apply
this
presumption.
now,
mr.
taylor
read
you
the
general
language
that
the
commission
had
in
its
decision
with
respect
to
this
presumption.
i'm
not
going
to
reread
it.
but
what
i
would
like
to
read
from
the
commission's
decision
is
what
it
said
in
this
case
when
reach
the
factor
that
it
has
to
reach
under
209
with
respect
to
the
impact
upon
the
protesting
carriers.
and
i
am
reading
from
the
bottom
of
page
45
of
the
record
and
what
it
says
is,
“the
requirement
of
section
209
(b)
that
we
consider
the
effect
which
are
grant
of
authority
would
have
upon
the
services
of
protesting
carriers
has
we
believe
been
adequately
discussed,”
where
on
page
42
the
language
that
mr.
taylor
read
you.
it
is
sufficient
at
this
point
to
say
that
in
view
of
our
finding
herein,
that
u.s.a.c.
is
in
a
position
to
provide
any
service
that
is
needed.
we
conclude
that
a
grant
of
authority
to
the
applicant
would
have
an
adverse
affect
upon
the
protestant.
in
other
words,
without
any
attempt
to
analyze
what
the
real
impact
will
be,
they
say,
“it
is
sufficient
that
they
can
provide
the
service,
therefore,
if
they
don't
get
it,
it
will
have
an
adverse
effect
upon
it.”
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
not
very
extensive,
this
is
the
entire
record.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
all
the
witnesses.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
rice
suggests
that
there
was
something
bearing
on
the
subject
that
wasn't
evaluated?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
there
was
very
little
if
anything
which
you
can
make
an
appropriate
analysis
on.
but
if
the
commission
were
to
disagree
with
me
and
say
that
we
think
that
this
and
this
in
the
record
is
sufficient,
i
might
have
more
difficulty
in
arguing
that
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they
must
consider
the
problem
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
and
not
consider
in
the
light
of
a
pure
generalization.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
let
me
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
but
your
honor,
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
the
issue
was
canvassed,
it's
a
question
of
what
such
evidence
as
there
is
in
the
record
means
and
they
must
evaluate.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir.
they
did
not
evaluate.
they
simply
said,
“we
don't
have
to
discuss
this
matter
because
we've
already
said
that
we
are
applying
a
general
presumption.”
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
is
one
statement
--
no,
that's
just
general
again.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
say
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
would
think
the
answer
to
your
question
would
be
no.
but
if
the
commission
were
to
disagree
with
me
and
pick
on
some
bit
of
evidence
and
say,
“this
is
sufficient,”
i
am
not
in
a
position
now
to
say
that
i
would
say
that
that
was
unreasonable,
so
unreasonable
that
it
would
have
to
be
removed
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it's
up
to
the
commission
to
come
to
this
court
having
evaluated
the
evidence
and
not
to
say
to
this
court,
“we
didn't
evaluate
the
evidence.
we
just
played
on
a
general
presumption
but
you
look
at
the
record
and
see
whether
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
support
this
generalization.”
i
think
that's
a
fairly
shocking
point
of
view,
not
a
one
that
this
court
would
normally
want
to
hear
to.
i
think
it's
up
to
the
commission
as
the
body
here
that's
got
the
statutory
responsibility
to
evaluate
the
evidence.
and
your
job
is
to
review
whether
that's
a
reasonable
evaluation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
sir.
it's
a
challenge.
this
is
a
debatable
question
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
are
inadequate?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
argument
is
one,
they
had
previous
experience
with
the
protesting
carrier
and
it
was
found
to
be
unsatisfactory.
two
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
record
is
very
weak
on
this
because
when
they
started
to
testify
on
this
unsatisfactory
past
history,
the
examiner
cut
them
off
and
said
that's
1952.
that's
too
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
long
ago.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it's
--
i
can't
give
you
the
exact
page.
it's
in
the
testimony
of
a
namesake
of
mine,
but
no
relative
by
the
name
of
ernest
solomon
which
appears
in
the
record
roughly
between
pages
83
and
109,
but
i
am
sure
his
counsel
will
know
better
than
i
do.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
was
argued
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
was
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
was
argued
that
the
common
carrier
protested,
had
a
provision
in
his
tariff
which
gave
him
permission
to
keep
control
at
all
times
of
the
vehicles
and
that
this
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
him
to
dedicate
vehicles
to
the
particular
shipper.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
these
were
all
discussed
by
the
commission
and
reject
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
there
are
some
evidence
on
that.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
is
very
little
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
anything
but
there
is
some
evidence
on
this.
it's
mostly
opinion
evidence.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
is
not
very
much
evide
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
some.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
are
supporting
the
commission
on
this
point,
your
honor.
i
am
just
answering
justice
black's
question,
sir.
we
think
that
these
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'm
talking
about
the
j-t
case.
i
will
talk
about
the
reddish
case
later,
it's
at
--
no.
but
in
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
which
the
commission
considered
and
evaluated.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
think
so.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
i
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
no,
your
question
is
the
heart
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
no,
no,
your
question
is
the
heart
of
the
problem.
what
your
honor
is
asking
me
is
if
the
protesting
carriers
can
arguendo,
provide
fully
and
completely
for
the
shippers,
why
do
you
have
to
go
beyond
that?
why
doesn't
that
end
the
case?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
why
doesn't
that
end
the
case?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
this
so,
i
think,
gets
into
the
basic
problem
of
the
relationship
between
common
carriers
and
contract
carriers
and
the
basic
difference
in
standards
for
passing
upon
the
two.
unfortunately,
our
brief
does
not
contain
the
standards
for
common
carrier
applications
but
i've
handed
it
up
to
you,
207
of
the
act
provides
that
common
carriers
are
to
be
passed,
common
carrier
applications
are
to
be
passed
upon
in
the
normal
way
that
a
utility
application
is
to
be
passed
upon,
i.e.
a
common
carrier
must
show
that
the
service
he
wishes
to
provide
is
or
will
be
required
by
present
or
future
public
interest
and
necessity,
and
that
is
the
standard
language
for
applicant
for
common
carrier
facilities
and
railroads,
telephones,
telegraph,
public
utilities.
contract
carriages
are
different
animal.
the
standard
of
section
209
does
not
require
him
to
show
that
there
is
a
public
need
for
the
service.
instead,
the
provisions
of
section
209
are
that
the
commission
shall
grant
a
contract
carrier
application
if
it
is
consistent
with
the
public
interest
and
the
national
transportation
policy.
now,
this
distinction
which
the
lower
courts
mentioned
reflects
i
think
a
real
distinction
that
congress
was
making.
we
agree
completely
with
the
commission
that
the
basic
reason
for
regulating
contract
carriage
was
to
ensure
that
contract
carriers
didn't
skim
the
cream
off
the
market
and
hurt
the
common
carriers
upon
which
the
small
people
in
the
country
necessarily
depend.
but
the
commission
felt,
i
mean
the
congress
felt
that
that
was
the
primary
reason
for
regulating
contract
carriers
and
unless
there
was
a
demonstrable
effect
upon
the
common
carriers,
there
wasn't
any
need
to
prevent
the
small
man
from
buying
a
truck
and
going
into
business
providing
for
the
special
services
of
a
shipper.
and
therefore,
they
had
this
distinction
in
the
standards.
now,
prior
to
1957
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'm
getting
to
209.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'm
getting
to
209,
sir,
because
209
gets
to
the
relationship
as
a
result
of
the
1957
amendments.
now,
prior
to
1957,
despite
the
statutory
scheme,
the
commission
had
a
very
real
problem
and
that
was
--
i
am
really
taking
much
too
much
time,
but
let
me
try
at
least
answer
it.
the
problem
they
have
was
that
prior
to
1957,
when
they
were
passing
upon
an
application
for
a
contract
carrier
applicant,
they
didn't
know
what
they
were
passing
on
and
the
reason
for
that
was
that
prior
to
1957,
a
contract
carrier
application
was
a
hunting
license.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
a
hunting
license.
it
was
a
--
maybe
a
limited
hunting
license
but
it
didn't
limit
the
person
when
he
got
his
permit
to
serving
the
particular
shippers
whose
needs
he
had
applied
to
serve.
he
could
go
out
and
get
additional
shippers
and
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
contract
steel
case,
which
mr.
taylor
mentioned
yesterday,
the
court
made
that
perfectly
clear.
it
said,
“as
long
as
he
keeps
within
the
general
specialization
field
that
he
had
been
licensed
for,
he
is
perfectly
able
and
willing
to
go
out
and
get
as
many
new
contracts
as
he
wants.”
now,
that
meant
--
that
meant
that
despite
this
difference
in
standard,
the
commission
had
a
real
problem
because
it
never
could
really
tell
when
it
made
a
grant
for
a
contract
carrier
what
its
impact
was
going
to
be.
it
could
not
say,
“this
fellow
is
going
to
serve
shipper
a
and
b
and
we
can
tell
what
the
impact
of
his
serving
shipper
a
and
b
is
because
as
soon
as
it
got
the
permit,
he
could
turn
around
and
serve
shippers
d,
e,
f
and
g
as
well.
and
therefore,
the
commission
over
the
years
did
evolve
a
policy
of
changing
the
act
and
turning
around
completely.
and
applying
to
contract
carrier
applications
the
same
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
showing
standard
that
the
act
provided
for
common
carriers
and
it
thought
that
was
necessary
because
of
this
problem
i
mentioned.
but
this
problem
has
been
resolved.
the
1957
amendments
do
for
the
first
time
give
the
commission
the
authority
when
j-t
comes
here
and
says,
i
want
to
serve
boeing.
they
say,
“okay.
we
will
give
you
a
grant
to
serve
boeing
and
if
you
want
to
serve
some
other
air
companies,
you
come
in
and
amend
your
certificate
before
you
do
it.
there
are
certain
minor
exceptions
to
this.
this
isn't
may
be
quite
as
definite
as
i
might
be
implying.
there
are
certain
substitution
rights
but
barring
that,
the
commission
now
has
control,
it
can
determine.
it
can
go
back
to
where
it
should
have
been
in
the
first
place.
i'm
very
belated
in
coming
to
answer
your
question
justice
black.
it
can
now
allow
a
man
to
go
into
the
contract
carrier
field
even
though
there
isn't
any
showing
of
unmeetable
need
if
that
man
can
go
in
without
demonstrable
harm
to
the
existing
carrier.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
let
me
--
let
me
backtrack
on
demonstrable.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
am
suggesting
that
the
1957
amendments
were
both
an
enlargement
and
a
contraction,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
is
correct.
the
origin
of
the
statute
was
a
proposal
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
cut
down
on
contract
carriers.
but
like
many
other
things,
what
starts
out
as
one
thing
ends
up
as
another,
and
the
contract
carrier
people,
the
legislative
history
makes
perfectly
clear,
got
their
quid
pro
quo
in
this
compromised
legislation.
as
the
congress
made
perfectly
clear
in
its
report,
everybody
was
happy
with
this
at
the
end.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
statute
as
it
eventually
enacted
was
enacted
with
the
hosannas
of
everybody.
it
was
a
compromised
legislation
and
everybody
was
satisfied.
the
commission
was
satisfied.
the
contract
carrier
people
were
satisfied.
the
common
carrier
people
were
satisfied.
everybody
was
satisfied
as
the
reports
make
clear
this
was
compromised
legislation.
the
main
thing
the
common
carriers
and
the
main
thing
the
commission
were
worried
about
as
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
and
as
the
common
carrier
people
said
when
they
withdrew
their
objections
to
certain
other
changes,
the
main
thing
they
were
afraid
of
was
this
court's
decision
in
the
contract
dealings,
the
hunting
license
problem
to
which
i
referred
previously.
to
get
that
plug,
they
were
willing
to
add
these
five
factors
to
section
209.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they
were
not
in,
in
the
original
pro
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
original
commission
proposal
to
section
209
(b)
did
not
contain
any
of
this
language
of
evaluating
these
five
factors.
that
was
suggested
originally
by
my
friend
mr.
todd
representing
the
contract
carrier
group.
the
commission's
original
suggestion
for
209
(b),
on
the
contrary,
would
have
put
the
burden
upon
the
contract
carriers
to
show
that
the
common
carriers
were
unwilling
and
unable
to
provide
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
adequacy.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
effect,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
in
a
lot
of
cases,
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
commission
was
acting
that
had
never
been
approved
by
the
courts
and
i
suggest,
to
your
honor,
that
that's
why
they
originally
attempted
in
1957
to
get
language
into
the
act
to
nail
down
the
policy
which
they
had
been
applying.
but
they
weren't
successful.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they
withdrew
it.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
you're
--
i
think
so,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
because
i
read
this
language
to
be
really
getting
at
this
problem
of
saying
that
you
have
to
show
a
need
or
you
don't
get
your
grant
irrespective
of
what
the
real
impact
is
on
common
carriers.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
sir.
that
is
not
the
position
of
the
government.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
--
with
all
due
respect
to
both
myself
and
justice
whittaker,
i
do
not
think
we
quite
meant
that.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
why
i
--
that's
why
i
hedged
my
answer
to
judge
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
think
i've
made
my
position
clear.
if
i
misstated
in
my
answer
to
justice
whittaker,
i
really
think
that
it
is
better
that
i
let
my
colleagues
make
their
position
clear
than
trying
to
resolve.
if
i
misstated
myself
justice
frankfurter,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
wouldn't
have
put
it
the
way
judge
smith
did
it
because
he
implies
that
they
were
considering
only
a
six-factor?
now,
i
don't
think
that
is
what
he
meant.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
your
honor,
and
i
suggest
that
the
decision
can
be
--
go
on
not
on
what
judge
smith
said,
but
what
the
law
is.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
don't
agree
for
a
minute
that
the
only
question
here
was
cost
and
maybe
i'll
have
time
to
get
back
to
the
other
factors
but
i
think
they've
been
fairly
well
canvassed
already.
but
let
me
direct
myself
immediately
to
the
cost
problem
which
is
a
serious
one
and
a
recurring
one
and
this
is
merely
an
example
of
a
commission
decision
in
which
they
say
we
won't
consider
cost.
now,
let's
see
what
we're
talking
about
and
let's
us
look
at
what
the
claim
was
and
what
the
commission
did.
you
look
at
page
388
of
the
record.
the
commission
in
its
decision
says
what
the
contract
carrier
applicant
claim
and
after
the
--
about
halfway
down
that
long
paragraph,
three
or
four
lines
after
the
reference
to
the
schaffer
case,
you
will
see
that
they're
discussing
the
claim
made
by
the
contract
carrier
and
he
said
that
in
determining
an
application
for
contract
carrier
authority,
we,
the
commission,
must
consider
whatever
distinct
advantages
contract
carrier
service
may
have
overcome
in
carrier
service
including
the
possible
ability
of
a
contract
carrier
to
offer
service
at
lower
rates.
that's
the
claim.
how
does
the
commission
respond
to
this
claim?
look
at
page
395.
this
is
how
they
respond
to
the
claim.
the
only
serious
complaint
which
shippers
have
against
existing
service,
i'm
reading
from
the
final
paragraph
on
that
page,
is
with
the
less
than
truck
load
rates
of
motor
common
carriers.
i
don't
think
that's
true,
but
that's
what
the
commission
says.
even
should
the
application
be
granted,
they
assert,
they
will
continue
to
use
common
carrier
service
to
some
extent.
that's
true,
but
irrelevant.
that
is
with
respect
to
the
car
loan
service
not
the
less
than
car
loan
service,
then
they
go
on
and
say,
“it
may
clearly
be
concluded,
we
believe,
that
the
support
of
the
application
rests
entirely
on
a
desire
to
obtain
lower
rates”
and
their
answer,
“this
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
to
justify
a
grant
of
authority
to
a
new
carrier.”
let
me
go
on
to
say
as
mr.
rice
does
that
the
solution
is
to
handle
this
matter
in
a
rate
proceeding.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
quite
know
what
that
would
mean.
how
that
word
alone
change
the
situation?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
would
not
agree
with
them.
particularly
in
the
case
here
where
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
nothing
alone
is
justification
for
anything.
you
have
to
just
look
at
the
whole
facts.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
that
is
particularly
true
in
this
case
where
the
commission
accepts
the
examiner's
findings
and
in
fact
makes
themselves
that
these
shippers
are
going
to
go
back
to
private
carriage.
they
accept
those
findings
and
yet
by
applying
this
presumptions,
which
i
discussed
i'm
afraid
too
long
this
morning,
they
say
nevertheless
--
although
the
shippers
are
going
to
go
back
to
private
carriage,
nevertheless
the
protestants
are
going
to
be
injured.
now,
certainly
in
the
light
of
that
type
of
thing,
even
if
this
was
the
only
factor,
it
would
be
an
important
factor.
it
isn't
the
only
factor,
but
even
if
it
was,
it
would
be.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
legal
significance
of
a
threat
of
going
back
to
private
carriage
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
i'm
picking
up
your
word
threat.
i
don't
think
there
is
much
legal
significance
of
a
threat.
i
think
a
threat
can
be
analyzed
against
the
facts
of
what's
going
on.
they
could
have
looked
to
see
whether
--
what
other
shippers
were
doing
in
this
area.
it
turns
out,
however,
when
you
look
to
see
what
other
shippers
are
doing
in
this
area
that
the
other
shippers
in
this
area
are
engaged
in
private
carriage
for
their-less-than
truckload
goods.
they
could
have
looked
to
see
whether
he
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
that
is
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
that
is
important.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
legal
relevance
of
that
is
sir,
that
if
that
is
true,
the
common
carrier
protestants
cannot
be
hurt
because
they're
not
going
to
get
this
business
anyway
and
the
legal
relevance
of
that
is
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
me
if
cost
were
the
only
factor.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
question
is
the
effect
upon
the
common
carrier.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission
doesn't
say
speculative.
the
commission
says
that
--
the
commission
accepts
and
makes
findings
that
there
will
be
no
real
damage
to
them.
the
only
damage
the
commission
finds
is
this
presumption.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
in
large
part.
let
me
get
back
to
the
question.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
much
more
than
money
as
mr.
ginnane
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
sure,
sure.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
i
agree
completely,
yes.
but
the
cost
problem,
the
commission
has
taken
a
ball
statement
that
it
won't
consider
cost
factors
and
it
won't
consider
them
in
the
context
that
was
made
which
i
read
you
and
which
is
more
expanded
up
in
their
actual
pleadings
before
the
commission
of
an
alleged
inherent
efficiency.
we
have
exactly
the
same
commission
determination
here
that
this
court
dealt
with
in
the
schaffer
cas
e.the
only
problem,
real
problem
is
whether
this
is
different
from
the
schaffer
case
because
of
the
fact
that
schaffer
or
maybe
schaffer
happened
to
deal
with
the
competition
between
motor
carriers
who
were
the
applicants
there
and
railroads
who
where
the
protestants,
whereas
this
case
deals
with
conflict
between
two
types
of
motor
carriage.
that's
the
whole
question
as
far
as
we
can
see.
that
there's
no
distinction
between
those
distinctions
i
have
made,
schaffer
is
clearly
applicable
here.
now,
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
distinction.
we
don't
even
think
this
court
need
--
get
to
the
problem
which
is
discussed
in
some
of
the
briefs
under
which
the
lower
court
didn't
feel
that
had
to
get
to.
the
verbal
problem
as
to
whether
contract
carriage
by
motor
transport
is
a
different
mode
of
operation
than
contract
carriage
by
motor
transport.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
there's
no
definition
of
the
word
mode
and
you'd
been
in
a
verbal
more
asked.
but
we
don't
think
that
that's
necessary
anyway
because
the
national
transportation
policy
which
is
involved
here
and
which
is
what
this
court
in
schaffer
said
the
commission
had
to
apply
and
was
incorrectly
not
applying
when
it
made
exactly
the
same
statement
about
rates.
isn't
limited
to
inherent
advantages
of
different
modes.
on
the
contrary
as
the
court
below
correctly
pointed
out,
one
of
the
major
important
factors
of
the
national
transportation
policy
is
to
promote
safe,
adequate,
economical
and
efficient
service
among
the
several
carriers.
and
we
haven't
got
the
slightest
doubt
that
within
the
context
of
that
language,
if
a
type,
i
won't
use
the
word
mode,
if
i
type
a
motor
carriage
is
capable
of
providing
cheaper
service
that
that
is
something
that
the
commission
must
consider.
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
this.
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
this,
we
think
it's
eliminated
by
the
amendment
to
section
209
(b)
because
three
months
before
schaffer,
congress
put
in
to
the
act
an
expressed
requirement
of
the
commission
in
passing
upon
these
contract
carrier
applications,
consider
the
effect
of
a
denial
upon
the
shippers.
now,
it
didn't
say
consider
only
effects
of
the
denial
upon
the
shipper's
except
whether
the
cost
factors
here
are
significant
to
them.
it
said,
consider
the
effect
of
a
denial
upon
the
shippers,
and
we
take
that
to
mean
what
it
says.
whatever
the
effects
maybe,
they
should
be
considered.
now,
consideration,
one
of
the
difficulties
in
this
whole
business
is
that
some
of
our
friends
on
the
appellant
side
seemed
to
equate
with
the
word
consideration
with
the
word
decision.
of
course,
the
commission
has
broad
discretion
after
it
gives
full
weight
to
whatever
cost
factors
are
involved,
to
point
that
they
are
outweighed
by
other
factors.
and
particularly,
i'd
be
the
first
to
agree
that
if
there's
any
serious
threat
to
the
common
carriers
in
an
area
which
is
necessary
that
might
often
outweigh
this
thing.
but
the
problem
here
is
the
commission
never
stops
to
consider
it
and
we
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
cost
problems
must
be
considered.
let
me
say
a
word,
however,
about
something
that
mr.
rice
said
which
justice
frankfurter
picked
up,
and
that
is
the
efficacy
of
a
rate
proceeding
to
settle
this
type
of
problem.
and
i
think
justice
frankfurter
is
quite
right,
presumably
the
commission
could
maintain
this
temporary
authority
while
it
went
through
a
rate
proceeding.
it
would
be
one
of
longest
temporary
authorities
of
all
time
since
this
rate
proceeding
would
be
from
five
points,
from
four
points
to
35
or
40
points
throughout
the
country
involved
in
many
carriers,
but
it
could
do
that.
but
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
the
main
answer
to
this
rate
proceeding
as
a
way
out
of
this
problem,
is
that
it
doesn't
settle
anything.
it
is
quite
possible,
quite
probable
i
would
say
that
what
is
a
reasonable
rate
for
a
common
carrier
in
the
view
of
its
other
responsibilities
to
the
public,
is
still
a
much
higher
rate
than
a
contract
carrier
can
provide.
and
therefore,
after
you
get
through
with
your
rate
proceeding,
you
are
--
with
all
likelihood
will
still
have
an
inherent
advantage
which
it
has
to
be
considered.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
i
agree.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
agree
that
the
problem
here
really
isn't
rates.
the
problem
here
really
is
inherent
cost
advantages.
this
isn't
a
rate
problem
that
has
to
be
worked
out
to
decimal
points
by
accounting
techniques.
the
problem
is
--
the
problem
of
administrative
agency
such
as
the
cab
in
cases
we
mentioned
in
our
brief,
handle
all
the
time
looking
at
a
problem
in
its
logical
sense
and
saying
is
there
something
inherently
important
here
which
should
be
considered
and
there
obviously
is
and
they
should
give
it
some
reasonable
way
instead
of
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
when
this
court
rejects
an
argument
which
it
has
considered,
it
doesn't
say
it
hasn't
considered
and
that's
what
the
commission
has
said.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there's
no
--
there's
no
area
for
ambiguity
justice
frankfurter.
the
commission's
brief
makes
perfectly
clear
that
if
this
court
accepts
the
statement
here,
they're
going
to
continue
until
the
court
tells
them
not
to,
to
ignore
any
rate
factor,
that's
their
position
and
that's
what
they're
going
to
do.
now,
very,
very
briefly,
let
me
get
to
the
problem,
the
non-rate
factors
here.
i
think
this
has
mostly
been
canvassed
in
the
colloquy
between
mr.
ginnane
and
the
chief
justice
and
it's
perfectly
clear
as
mr.
ginnane
frankly
admitted
that
a
single
carrier
devoting
himself
to
these
shippers
who
can
serve
all
of
their
points
that
they
originate
from
and
go
to
all
of
the
points
that
they're
going
to,
can
get
there
faster
than
the
common
carriers.
not
one
of
them,
not
one
common
carrier
protested
in
this
record
can
serve
even
the
four
originating
points,
to
say
nothing
of
serving
all
the
points
where
particular
loads
have
to
go
to.
it
doesn't
mean
anything
to
say
that
canned
goods
is
a
typical
product
carried
by
railroad
common
carriers
and
motor
common
carriers,
of
courses
it
is.
but
although,
canned
good
require
as
far
as
the
makeup
of
the
truck,
that
ordinary
truck,
the
particular
problem
that
we're
dealing
with
here
is
the
problem
of
a
shipper
of
canned
goods
who
has
--
certainly
enough
adequacy
into
this
record,
a
need
for
shipping
at
short
notice,
small
orders
to
a
number
of
shippers
and
it
cannot
be
done
by
the
complicated
interlining
consolidation
drop
off
techniques
that
the
common
carriers
because
of
their
limitations
of
authority
after
hand.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
record
makes
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
difference
is
this.
supposing
you
have
a
--
we're
talking
about
small
shipments.
there
are
300,000
pounds
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
contract
carrier
can
pick
up
three
smaller
shipments
from
the
steele
plant
in
springdale
and
go
on
to
the
warehouse
in
westville,
oklahoma
and
pick
up
three
more
and
then
take
them
directly,
in
the
same
truck
without
any
interchange
or
anything
like
that
to
five
or
six
points
in
different
states
on
his
way
out.
the
common
carriers
in
the
first
place
if
there
is
a
--
there's
no
common
carrier
who
can
pick
up
from
all
of
these
four
places.
they
just
don't
have
the
authority
to
do
so.
there
are
many
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
one.
one
can
pick
up
from
one
place
and
another
can
pick
up
from
another
place
and
they
can
get
together
to
the
third
place
and
move
it
from
one
place
on
one
truck
to
another
place
on
another
truck,
but
obviously
that
takes
time.
that's
not
the
way
you
get
an
efficient
split
minute
transportation
system.
similarly,
as
they
go
along
even
if
we
--
even
if
the
particular
shipments
could
all
be
picked
up
by
one
common
carrier
at
the
originating
point,
the
record
makes
clear
there
are
a
lot
of
these
shipments
which
are
not
going
to
where
that
common
carrier
can
drop
off
beyond
his
area
of
his
limited
license.
therefore,
for
those
shipments,
he
can
drop
off
somewhere
along
the
line
then
he
has
to
transfer
to
another
truck.
the
result,
the
record
indicates
its
damages
in
this
transporting
from
one
thing
to
another,
delays,
the
type
--
they
just
can't
--
they
can
do
it,
but
they
just
can't
do
it
as
fast
and
efficiently.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
exactly.
exactly
that's
what
contact
carrier
service
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
exactly,
exactly
and
this
is
agreed
to
by
the
commission.
the
commission
itself
admits
on
page
394
that
although
protestant
carriers
especially
those
operating
over
regular
loads,
they
don't
quite
admit
it,
they
almost
admit
it
that
they
may
be
hindered
in
some
instances
by
their
authorities
and
the
nature
of
their
operation
from
achieving
complete
flexibility,
the
commission
admits
this
and
mr.
ginnane
was
perfectly
candid
about
it.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
permit
them
to
do
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
original
premise
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
premise
was
that
they
were
there
by
the
time
congress
got
around
to
regulating
motor
carriage
in
1934
or
1935,
there
were
three
types
of
carriers.
there
was
private
carriage,
there
was
common
carriage
and
there
was
this
third
type
of
carriage
where
individuals
engaged
in
the
transportation
business
were
transporting
not
as
common
carriers,
but
as
contract
carriers
and
the
commission
felt
that
if
it
--
the
congress
felt
they
have
to
regulate
this
existing
type
of
service.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
only
to
a
very
limited
degree.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
not
in
our
opinion,
but
that's
the
argument
i
made
in
the
first
argument.
that's
the
difference
in
the
language
between
207
and
209
as
example
--
as
enlarged
upon
in
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
think
so
sir.
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
but
i
do
want
in
fairness
say,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
was
regulating
contract
carriage
among
other
things,
one
of
his
primary
reasons
in
regulating
contract
carriage
was
to
prevent
an
undo
burden
upon
common
carriage
by
a
overlooking
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
when
congress
passed
the
1935
motor
carrier
act
it
was
imposing
restrictions
on
both
common
and
contract
carriers.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir
not
until
1935.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
was
imposing
restrictions.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
--
their
state
law
is
more
complicated
than
that.
they
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please,
i
represented
mr.
reddish
below
and
the
--
before
the
commission
and
i'm
representing
here.
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
of
assistance
to
this
court,
certainly
would
not
be
to
the
industry,
if
the
matter
of
the
application
of
the
statutory
standards
was
allowed
to
go
by
the
board
and
if
this
court
was
not
aware
of
the
circumstance,
which
brought
forth
the
five
criteria
which
are
now
specified
in
section
209
of
the
act,
you
will
recall
that
with
respect
to
what
congress
was
doing
in
1957,
it
was
imposing
on
contract
carriers
in
that
statute,
a
new
restriction,
something
entirely
new
and
different
and
intended
to
have
a
very
distinct
limitation
on
the
competitive
impact
of
an
individual
contract
carrier
on
the
common
carrier
operation.
and
that
restriction
was
to
be
found
in
giving
the
commission
new
power,
never
before
held
in
1957,
to
identify
the
shippers
by
name
that
that
contract
carrier
would
be
permitted
to
serve.
and
that
had
a
very
significant
effect
upon
the
ability
of
the
contract
carrier
to
compete
then
and
in
the
future
as
it
does
on
mr.
reddish.
let
us
take
for
example,
the
question
here
just
before
this
court.
if
it
is
a
fact
that
the
steele
canning
company
is
not
going
to
refuse
to
go
to
private
carriage,
mr.
reddish
would
be
one
who
suffers
if
they
go
because
he
no
longer
has
the
authority
which
he
would've
had
prior
to
1957
to
search
for
another
canning
company
in
this
area
to
serve.
he
is
bound
now
and
for
all
of
the
time
into
the
operations
of
the
steele
canning
company
or
the
cain
canning
company
and
then
the
keystone
canning
company.
now,
that
competitive
impact
that
that
carrier
can
make
as
a
result
of
the
1957
amendment
made
a
very
distinct
difference
and
what
the
commission
was
to
consider
when
they
came
to
considering
the
impact
on
existing
carriage.
and
if
you
will
look
at
the
criteria
in
the
statute,
you
will
see
that
the
criteria
is
not
a
direction
to
the
commission
to
consider
the
impact
on
all
common
carriage
or
the
entire
common
carriage
system
of
the
united
states.
the
question
the
commission
is
directed
to
or
points
its
attention
to
is
whether
or
not
the
grant
of
the
authority
will
affect
the
services
of
the
protesting
carrier,
not
the
services
even
of
all
carriers
in
united
states,
but
the
protesting
carriers
alone.
and
secondly,
the
impact
on
the
services
of
those
carriers
because
now
for
the
first
time
in
1957,
it
was
possible
for
the
commission
to
determine
precisely
what
the
effect
would
be
now,
and
in
the
future
perhaps
or
at
least
to
make
a
judgment
with
that
respect
in
that
connection
because
they
could
now,
for
the
first
time,
determine
what
the
shipper
was
and
who
he
would
be
now
and
in
the
future.
and
so,
you
can
look
at
steele
canning
company's
present
services.
you
can
look
at
their
present
transportation.
you
can
look
at
what
has
been
performed
in
the
past
and
what
is
likely
and
make
a
judgment
as
to
what
is
to
what's
likely
to
be
performed
in
the
future
and
be
able
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
the
services
of
the
protesting
common
carriers
or
protesting
contract
carriers
although
how
there
could
be
and
in
view
of
the
limitation
of
by
shipper's
by
name,
i
don't
not
know.
but
in
any
case,
you
could
make
a
determination
precisely
of
the
effect,
that
that
kind
of
a
grant
would
have
on
the
protesting
carrier.
and
the
commission
never
did
that
in
this
case.
the
commission
instead
resorted
to
precisely
those
tests
which
they
had
adopted
prior
to
1957
under
a
definition
of
a
statute
which
said
that
they
were
to
determine
whether
it
was
consistent
with
the
public
interest
in
the
national
transportation
policy
unguided
by
any
specific
criteria.
the
commission
applied
in
this
case
in
short,
precisely
those
standards
that
they
had
applied
previously
to
a
contract
carrier
who
would
have
the
free
and
unrestrained
right
to,
as
this
court
held
in
the
contract
steel
carriers
case
the
right
aggressively
to
search
for
and
add
new
contracts
within
the
scope
of
these
geographical
license
and
within
the
scope
of
the
commodity
was
authorized
transport.
now,
that
this
1957
amendment
constituted
a
marked
departure
from
the
act
prior
to
1957
is
i
think
crystal
clear
from
the
determination
of
the
way
in
which
congress
ordered
the
commission
to
deal
with
the
pre-existing
contract
carrier.
prior
to
1957,
the
contract
carrier
is
free
to
compete
for
potential
traffic
as
well
as
the
traffic
of
the
shippers
who
appeared
before
the
commission
and
testified.
these
pre-1957
contract
carriers
were
to
be
given
under
this
1957
amendment,
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
operate
as
common
carriers
and
they
were
to
be
given
these
solely
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
they
conform
to
the
new
definition
of
contract
carriage,
one
that
said
for
one
or
a
limited
number
of
shippers
meeting
the
distinct
needs
of
those
individual
shippers.
if
you
did
not
meet
that
new
standard,
you
were
to
be
given
a
common
carrier
of
certificate.
you
were
to
be
turned
into
what
congress
found
you
were
in
fact
to
wit
a
common
carrier.
and
therefore,
when
you
approach
and
apply
the
five
criteria,
that
are
now
specified
in
section
209
(b)
of
the
act,
you
have
a
situation
in
which
it
is
entirely
possible
that
you
have
specific
criteria
by
which
you
can
--
in
a
specific
factual
situation
by
which
you
can
measure
that
impact.
the
commission
never
did
that
here.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
services
of
the
protesting
carriers
in
this
case
would
in
anyway
be
affected,
nothing.
their
finances,
their
equipment,
the
services
that
they
are
rendering
to
the
public
generally,
nothing
in
this
record
suggests
one
word
as
to
what
in
any
way
that
would
be
affected
and
that
is
the
precise
and
as
i
take
it,
legal
significance
of
the
fact
that
this
shipper
has
--
or
the
shippers
involved
here
have
in
the
past
transported
these
shipments
in
their
own
private
carriage,
and
this
illegal
significance
of
the
fact
that
these
--
the
finding
of
the
commission
that
these
shippers
would
do
so
in
the
future
because
of
their
distinct
need
if
not
met
by
contract
carriers.
the
1957
amendments
to
the
part
ii
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
were
designed
to
give
the
commission
that
which
said
it
needed
so
desperately.
a
yardstick
by
which
they
could
distinguish
between
a
contract
carrier
and
a
common
carrier,
one
that
the
commission
told
congress
at
the
time
or
the
committee
is
considering
it
that
contract
carriers
have
inherent
differences
and
inherit
advantages
in
the
way
in
which
they
operate.
they
have
inherent
advantages
because
they
are
keyed
in.
they
are
locked
in
to
the
shippers
operation.
the
shipper
loads
their
vehicle.
the
vehicles
are
scheduled
to
go
into
their
production
either
inbound
or
outbound
movements
of
it.
you
don't
have
to
employ
a
core
of
solicitors
to
go
around
and
find
new
freight.
you
have
only
one
or
two
shippers
and
you're
so
coordinated
with
them.
you
are,
in
fact,
as
the
examiner
in
fact
found
in
this
case
the
shippers
wanted
mr.
reddish
to
be,
the
transportation
department
of
these
canning
companies.
you
don't
need
solicitation
expense
and
mr.
reddish
doesn't
have
any
solicitors
or
any
solicitation
expense
in
getting
that
kind
of
traffic.
you
don't
have
to
have
any
terminal.
mr.
reddish
doesn't
have
a
terminal.
he
has
a
garage
where
he
keeps
his
equipment
off.
you
don't
need
to
have
a
terminal
because
you
are
not
involved
in
the
handling
and
re-handling
of
the
freight
as
a
contract
carrier.
and
as
a
consequence,
you
have
precisely
those
inherent
advantages
that
the
chairman
of
the
commission
himself
pointed
out
that
congress
when
they
were
considering
common
contract
carriers
in
the
1957
amendments
to
this
act,
that
realized
cost
advantage.
cost
advantage
is
that
the
chairman
told
the
committee
they
had
and
that
the
commission
has
always
recognized
that
they
had.
the
question
that
the
shippers
were
trying
to
put
forward
to
the
commission
was
not
that
the
common
carriers
were
charging
them
an
unreasonable
or
a
burdensome
rate
considered
as
a
common
carrier
rate,
considered
as
the
necessary
to
carry
out
the
expenses
to
discharge
the
obligations
and
the
burdens
and
the
kind
of
service
that
a
common
carrier
is
expected
and
required
to
do
under
the
act.
these
rates
are
entirely
lawful.
they
are
reasonable
judged
by
that
standard.
but
we're
not
judging
them
by
that
standard.
we're
not
--
the
shipper
is
not
asking
for
them
by
that
standard.
the
shipper
is
asking
for
something
entirely
different.
he's
asking
for
that
which
prior
to
1935
would
have
been
called
private
for
hire
transportation,
a
kind
of
a
transportation
that
is
a
substitute
not
for
common
carriage
but
a
substitute
for
his
own
private
carriage.
and
now
what
happened
in
this
case,
what
the
commission
finally
did
by
insisting
that
the
shippers'
reasonable
transportation
need
as
they
would
choose
to
define,
found
within
their
prior
concepts
of
transportation,
by
doing
that,
the
commission
has
ignored
what
was
intended,
what
--
i
believe
that
the
legislative
history
and
what
the
act
itself
suggests
that
private
carriage
was
to
be
supplanted
by
or
at
least
the
shipper
was
to
have
an
alternative
of,
to
private
carriage
contract
carriage,
a
contract
carriage
that
was
so
distinctly
related
to
what
he
needed,
that
it
would
perform
the
kind
of
job
that
a
regular
common
carrier
serving
off
the
public
generally
could
not
perform.
but
the
commission,
by
refusing
to
apply
the
statutory
criteria,
and
by
saying
that
the
criterion
of
the
impact
or
the
effect
upon
the
shipper
of
the
denial
of
this
application,
is
in
effect
that
we
will
judge
solely
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
someone
can
in
fact
physically
transport
a
shipment
of
canned
goods
from
point
a
to
point
b
regardless
of
the
time
it
takes
them
to
transport
it
and
most
importantly
for
a
canned
good
shipper
regardless
of
the
cost
that
which
that
will
be
performed
for
you
is
denying
to
the
private
--
to
the
contract
carriers
under
the
1957
amendment,
precisely
what
congress
was
intending
to
give
them.
if
we
are
going
to
limit
you
on
the
one
hand,
to
serving
this
precisely
identified
shipper,
then
we
will
give
you
the
opportunity
on
the
other
hand
to
serve
his
distinct
needs
and
we
will
measure
whether
or
not
you
should
be
a
new
entered
into
the
field
by
the
considerations
of
those
shippers,
by
consideration
of
whether
you
will
in
fact
hurt
in
some
way
that
the
existing
common
carrier
transportation
system
of
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
as
for
example
mr.
justice
brennan,
supposed
that
this
shipper
was
not
in
fact
a
shipper
who
was
giving
to
the
contract
carrier
something
they
hadn't
transported
before
that
is
where
it
was
not
a
private
carriage
situation
but
where
the
shipper
said
we
want
you
to
transport
these
goods
and
these
goods
were
already
being
transported
by
a
number
of
common
carrier.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
those
circumstances
the
common
carrier
should
come
in.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
if
he
could
show
that
he
is
in
such
financial
condition
that
he
must
be
given
an
opportunity
to
transport
them,
that
his
existence
to
the
common
carrier
industry
because
of
his
financial
standing
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
even
though
--
if
he
could
show
that
his
financial
existence
required
that
he'd
be
given
an
opportunity
to
transport
all
potential
traffic
because
to
do
so
would
destroy
in
some
way,
the
fabric
or
the
kind
of
system
that
the
commission
has
built
up.
it
is
conceivable
that
the
commission
might
then
say,
“show
us
your
financial
condition.
show
that
your
needs
or
--
for
this
traffic
outweigh
the
shippers
specialized
in
individual
needs.”
that
is
a
conceivable
possibility.
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
restrain
the
commission's
ability
to
consider
what
they
thought
was
necessary
to
maintain
a
common
carrier
system
of
transportation
by
rail
or
by
motor
but
that's
not
what
they
did
here.
they
didn't
do
that
at
all.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
the
loss
of
this
traffic
now
or
in
the
future
would
in
any
way
affect
the
finances
of
the
protesting
carriers
or
would
in
any
way
affect
the
kind
of
operation
that
they
were
conducting
or
would
in
any
way
do
anything
else
to
these
carrier
of
a
specific
nature.
what
the
commission
held
here
was
consistent
with
their
holdings
prior
to
1957,
that
a
common
carrier
expressing
a
willingness
and
showing
to
the
commission
satisfaction
at
least
the
ability
to
transport
these
shippers,
that
that
common
carrier
was
to
be
permitted
the
opportunity
to
transport
those
goods
and
that
no
other
service
was
to
be
authorized
even
though
the
commission
at
the
same
time
held
that
on
this
record,
they
would
never
transport
those
goods
and
that
is
a
flat
and
specific
finding
by
the
commission.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
would
never
handle
it.
if
you'll
just
take
a
look
at
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
certainly
sir.
now,
it
maybe
if
the
commission
did
not
believe
the
shippers,
the
commission
could
weigh
that
fact
and
say,
“we
do
not
believe
the
shipper”
but
they
never
did
that.
they
believed
the
shipper.
they
believe
they
would
but
what
they
chose
to
do
was
to
adapt
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
said
even
so
you
must.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
he
said
that
and
he
said
it
in
my
judgment
because
he
was
about
to
report
a
bill
which
would
give
the
power
to
the
commission
for
the
first
time
seriously
to
limit
contract
carriers,
by
specifying
the
shippers
that
they
would
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
was
the
effect
of
what
he
was
reporting
out
at
that
instant
and
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
the
statute
did
so
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
my
judgment
by
adapting
a
new
restriction
on
contract
carriage,
and
at
the
same
time
by
adapting
criteria
that
were
relevant
to
the
new
and
change
status
of
the
contract
carrier,
a
new
and
distinctly
limited,
competitive
service
that
the
contract
carrier
would
be
able
to
perform
and
if
the
judgment
is
as
transportation
law,
that
you
should
not
regard
the
existence
of
private
carriage
as
an
alternative,
then
all
i
could
say
would
be
that
the
statute
will
be
wholly
out
of
step
with
the
reality
of
the
economic
need
which
moves
these
goods
across
the
country.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
is
nothing
in
the
committee's
report
but
there
is
substantial
amount
that
was
before
the
committee
at
the
time
they
were
considering
this
bill
and
the
substantial
shippers
all
appeared
before
congress
and
pointed
out
precisely
the
dilemma
in
which
this
kind
of
a
judgment
would
place
it.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
any
case,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
in
passing
upon
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
would
be
an
impact
on
the
shipper
from
an
effect
of
the
denial
of
the
application
and
the
suggestion
made
to
this
court
that
there
was
any
finding
by
the
commission
that
the
existing
service
of
the
common
carrier
was
in
fact
adequate
to
meet
the
needs
was
never
meant
in
any
terms
exclusive
of
cost
or
even
laying
aside
an
issue
of
cost.
the
commission
said
that
such
an
issue
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
perhaps
it
is.
if
common
carriage
is
in
fact
demonstrated
to
be
adequate
to
meet
the
shippers'
transportation
needs
then
it
would
seem
that
there
would
be
less
of
an
effect
upon
the
shipper
if
you
deny
the
application
of
the
contract
carrier.
although,
the
commission
in
the
reddish
case
said
that
such
a
determination
was
necessary
upon
them
under
the
new
1957
amendments
of
the
act,
they
never
made
such
a
determination,
never.
the
commission's
decision
in
the
reddish
case
is
couched
wholly
in
terms
of
--
the
shipper
has
failed
to
prove
that
the
existing
service
would
not
meet
his
reasonable
transportation
needs
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
shipper
resided
a
number
of
instances,
in
which
for
example,
it
was
proposed
by
one
common
carrier
to
him
that
in
order
to
transport
goods
to
iowa
and
to
illinois
that
they
transport
them
to
denver,
colorado
from
fort
smith,
arkansas
and
then
back.
they
said
this
is
generalized
kind
of
comment.
this
is
a
generalized
kind
of
objection
and
that
they
never,
however,
reach
any
determination
that
the
existing
service
would
in
fact
meet
any
need
of
the
shipper
whether
it's
couched
wholly
in
terms
of
cost
or
whether
it's
couched
in
terms
of
near
service
to
get
their
canned
goods
that
they
had
produced.
if
there
are
plants
in
arkansas
to
the
kinds
of
customers
that
they
have
to
sell
in
order
to
remain
in
business
and
in
order
