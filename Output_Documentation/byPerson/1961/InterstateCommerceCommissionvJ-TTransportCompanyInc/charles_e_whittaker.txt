but
do
they
have
one
at
the
point
of
destination?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
the
other
on
is
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
contend
that
the
service
rendered
--
supposedly
rendered
by
j-t
would
be
precisely
that
which
has
been
rendered
by
the
other
company?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
is
not
that
the
very
basis
upon
which
the
commission
had
acted
prior
to
those
amendments?
what
is
the
basis
that
they
had
to
these
showing
of
unwillingness
or
inability
on
the
part
of
the
common
carriers
upon
the
service,
before
a
contract
carrier
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
they
could
not
get
it
done,
but
they
finally
withdrew
it,
didn't
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
one
more
thing.
isn't
that
the
same
policy
which
judge
smith
found,
they
view
in
this
case,
despite
that
change
in
amendments?
i'll
refer
you
to
page
176
of
the
record,
where
it
says,
â€œwe
conclude
that
if
these
decisions
turning
solely
on
the
adequacy,
willingness,
and
ability
to
pass,
it
cannot
be
justified
and
were
clearly
erroneous.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
he
said,
now
here
comes
the
crux
of
the
matter,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
case
was
decided
by
the
commission
on
that
basis.
that's
the
fact
of
--
crux
of
his
holding,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
mr.
ginnane
that
the
average
stops
and
deliveries
here
was
about
six
per
trip
on
these
lcl
loads?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
the
most
--
that
a
common
carrier
or
through
line
hauler
could
efficiently
handle
would
be
two
or
three?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
would
like
to
understand
that
here
the
commission
approved
the
findings
of
the
examiner
but
did
not
follow
his
conclusion?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
he
find
--
the
examiner's
found
that
there
were
special
conditions
relative
to
the
delivery
of
these
canned
goods
that
these
various
shippers
had
rules
where
they
must
receive
from
a
particular
time
for
example?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
didn't
the
commission
--
didn't
the
examiner
find
that
the
common
carrier
service
couldn't
meet
that
kind
of
special
condition
and
that
it
could
be
not
only
by
a
contract
carrier
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
commission
--
the
examiner's
conclusion.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
you
call
it
conclusion,
i
referred
to
it
as
a
finding,
i
don't
not
know
which
it
is
