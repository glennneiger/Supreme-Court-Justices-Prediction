mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
and
i
am
sharing
my
time
with
mr.
rice
who
is
the
counsel
for
the
rail
and
motor
carriers
who
intervene
in
the
proceeding
before
the
commission
and
in
the
court
below.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
final
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
in
the
western
district
of
arkansas.
that
judgment
set
aside
in
order
of
the
commission,
which
denied
the
application
of
mr.
e.
l.
reddish
for
a
contract
carrier
permit.
this
case,
like
the
prior
j-t
case
involves
recurring
and
important
questions
as
to
the
relative
rules
of
common
carriage
and
contract
carriage
in
the
public
transportation
system.
he's
the
coordinator
of
transportation
as
pointed
out
back
in
1934.
these
problems
plagued
state
regulation
prior
to
federal
regulation.
they
were
an
issue
when
federal
regulation
begun
in
1935.
they
were
again
posed
in
the
litigation
before
this
court
in
the
contract
steel
carriers
case
and
they
were
posed
again,
we
think
by
the
lower
court's
interpretation
of
the
1957
amendments
which
followed
this
court's
decision
in
the
contract
steel
carriers
case.
like
j-t
but
upon
different
facts,
this
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
in
determining
an
application
for
a
contract
carrier
permit,
the
commission
is
precluded
from
considering
an
affirmative
showing
by
protesting
common
carriers
that
they
are
able
and
willing
to
provide
an
adequate
service
to
the
shipper.
the
case
also
involves
two
additional
questions,
questions
which
are
not
common
to
the
j-t
case,
whether
the
commission's
findings
as
to
the
effect
of
a
denial
upon
the
supporting
shipper
were
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
whether
in
determining
the
effect
of
a
denial
upon
the
shipper.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
whether
the
commission's
findings
as
to
the
effect
of
a
denial
upon
the
supporting
shipper
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
on
different
facts.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
but
this
is
an
evidentiary
problem
peculiar
to
this
case.
that's
all
i
meant
to
say.
the
third
question
is
whether
in
determining
the
effect
of
a
denial
on
the
shipper,
the
commission
must
give
consideration
to
the
proposed
lower
rates
of
the
applicant
for
a
contract
carrier
permit.
this
all
began
in
may
1958
when
mr.
reddish
applied
for
a
contract
carrier
permit.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
to
the
lower
rates
or
the
proposed
lower
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
on
this
record,
it
must
be
rates
because
there
were
no
costs
in
the
record
at
all
and
not
too
much
on
rates.
and
the
way
the
court
below
put
it
was
in
terms
of
rates
reflecting
inherently
lower
cost
but
with
nothing
in
this
record
on
anybody's
cost.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
there
was
nothing
in
there
as
to
what
per
se
these
were,
just
generalities.
and
as
i
say
that
there
--
i
will
point
out
shortly,
there's
very
little
in
there
as
to
what
the
actual
rates
were
for
that
matter
to
say
nothing
of
the
cost.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
in
the
hearing
before
the
hearing
examiner,
there
were
some
evidence
offered
on
cost
and
it
was
not
excluded.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
not
excluded.
i
mean
evidence
as
to
rates
was
received.
the
commission
on
its
report
held
that
in
this,
as
in
other
cases
involving
determinations
for
applications
for
either
common
carrier
certificates
or
contract
carrier
permits,
it
would
not
go
into
the
matter
of
rates.
that
would
restrict
this
determination
to
the
issues
of
service.
they
say
reddish
applied
for
a
contract
carrier
permit
to
transport
canned
food,
mostly
seasonal
vegetables
for
three
canning
companies
in
springdale,
lowell
and
fort
smith
arkansas
and
westville,
oklahoma
to
customers
located
at
points
in
33
states,
and
to
move
materials
and
supplies
used
in
canning
from
points
in
30
of
those
states
back
to
the
four
manufacturing
points.
and
the
geographical
scope
of
the
requested
authority
is
pretty
well-illustrated
in
a
map
which
appears
in
the
record
at
pages
32
and
33.
after
the
usual
administrative
proceedings,
division
1
of
the
commission
issued
its
report
denying
the
application,
and
a
petition
for
reconsideration
was
denied
by
the
entire
commission.
thereafter,
the
three-judge
court
set
aside
the
commission's
order,
remanded
the
case
to
the
commission
for
proceedings
consistent
with
that
court's
opinion.
the
court
below
held
first
that
that
1957
amendments
to
section
209
(b)
forbid
consideration
of
the
adequacy
of
legal
service
in
determining
whether
a
denial
of
a
contract
carrier
application
would
adversely
affect
the
supporting
shippers.
well
that's
in
the
record
at
page
406,
and
however,
secondly
that
the
denial
of
the
application
would
so
if
found
adversely
affect
the
supporting
shippers
as
it
found,
and
as
the
court
found
that
they
required
a
special
service
which
could
not
be
supplied
by
existing
common
carriers.
and
finally,
that
court
held
that
the
court
must
consider
the
lower
rates
of
a
contract
carrier
service
in
evaluating
the
effect
of
a
denial
upon
the
shipper.
i'll
try
to
summarize
the
facts
fairly.
there's
no
real
dispute
over
them
but
in
places
they're
vague
and
honest
man
can
interpret
them
differently.
the
steele
canning
company
is
the
principal
shipper
supporting
the
reddish
application,
and
one
of
their
officers
was
by
far
the
principal
witness.
steele
normally
buys
and
distributes
about
75%
of
the
output
of
the
other
two
shippers,
also
vegetable
canners.
steele
sells
its
merchandise
through
food
brokers,
to
wholesalers,
chain
stores
and
the
larger
supermarkets.
they
do
not
sell
to
the
corner
grocery
stores
as
suggested
in
the
department
of
justice's
brief.
they're
substantial
canners
and
they
sell
to
substantial
customers.
he
testified
that
the
majority
of
steele's
customers,
roughly
80%
of
them,
buying
orders
from
3,000
to
10,000
pounds
per
order.
3,000
pounds
will
represent
100
cases.
we
hold
our
minimum
to
a
100
case
shipment.
steele's
represent
and
testified
that
a
number
of
its
larger
customers
by
10
days
supply
where
10
years
ago,
they'd
buy
a
truck
load.
that
way,
they
can
operate
on
the
canner's
money.
i
think
that's
a
little
bit
of
the
ultimate
economic
background
with
some
of
these
transportation
situations.
the
canning
business
is
competitive
with
narrow
profit
margins.
steele's
competitors
in
the
arkansas
valley
and
nearby
points
use
a
combination
of
private
carriage
for
smaller
shipments
plus
common
carriage.
steele's
customers
placed
their
orders
principally
by
telephone
and
often
for
delivery
on
specified
days
or
even
specified
times
a
day.
steele
testified
that
we
used
common
carrier
and
straight
truckload
shipments
and
on
many
shipments
that
have
a
destination
and
two
intermediate
stops.
the
supporting
shipper's,
steele
and
the
others
stated
that
they
would
continue
to
use
common
carrier
service
on
truckload
shipments,
even
if
registered
application
were
granted.
now,
there's
a
history
to
this
transportation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
supporting
shippers
stated
that
they
would
continue
to
use
motor
common
carriers
for
truckload
shipments,
full
of
truckload
shipments
even
if
the
reddish
application
were
granted.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
are
in
effect
so
they
would
not.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
would
resort
to
private
carriage.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
the
history
of
this
transportation
is
something
like
in
the
drum
case
last
week.
in
1948,
steele
started
to
transfer
its
small
shipments
in
consolidated
lots,
in
its
own
vehicles,
private
carriage
bona
fide
private
carriage.
and
he
continued
that
until
1958,
when
he
encountered
labor
difficulties,
which
resulted
in
a
sharp
reduction
in
his
contract
and
his
private
carriage
operations.
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
on
reddish's
application,
the
commission
authorized
reddish
to
perform
a
temporary
service
authorized
in
temporary
authority
to
serve
steele
as
a
contract
carrier,
a
temporary
authority
which
is
still
in
effect
pending
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
the
shippers
testified
that
they
could
not
use
the
less
than
truckload
services
of
the
protesting
motor
common
carriers
for
various
reasons.
first,
that
although
small
shipments
must
be
carried,
as
a
matter
of
economics
and
consolidated
truckloads,
a
common
carrier
often
cannot
carry
consolidated
loads
because
it
doesn't
serve
all
the
destinations.
that
is
of
the
different
points,
it
will
have
to
breakup
the
consolidated
loan
for
interline
or
interchange
with
other
carriers
that
do
serve
the
destinations.
secondly,
they
alleged,
although
in
somewhat
general
terms,
that
such
interchange
when
they
used
more
than
one
carrier
can
result
in
delay,
increased
likelihood
of
damage
and
misconsignment
of
shipments.
and
finally,
they
alleged
that
the
protesting
motor
common
carriers
will
handle
such
ltl
shipments
only
at
rates
higher
than
truckload
rates.
in
its
report,
the
commission
purported
to
summarize
the
general
position
of
the
shippers
as
follows.
this
is
in
the
record
at
page
390.
steele's
representative
expressed
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
forced
out
of
business,
if
it
had
to
ship
the
numerous
small
orders
of
canned
goods
in
less
than
truckload
quantities
at
less
than
--
at
less
than
truckload
common
carrier
rates
and
that
successful
operation
of
its
business
necessitates
the
movement
of
this
traffic
in
consolidated
loads
either
by
private
carriage
or
in
for--
hire
transportation
at
truckload
at
rates.
there
wasn't
too
much
specific
evidence
as
to
rates.
looking
at
the
reddish's
brief
and
the
citations
which
he
gives,
they
refer
the
court
to
pages
in
the
record
which
show
his
rates
to
a
few
points
in
ohio
and
it's
cited
as
showing
that
he
was
performing
to
those
points,
pooled
truck
movement
of
small
shipments
at
a
cost
to
the
shipper,
at
a
rate
comparable
to
the
truckload
rate
of
the
motor
common
carriers.
also
the
steele
representative
testified
year
rates
addressing
the
cross-examiner,
year
rates
on
ltl
shipments
are
prohibited
in
the
most
points.
but
later,
he
was
asked
to
explain
that
and
he
said,
“i
mean
those
rates
and
certain
occasions
are
two
and
three
times
as
high
as
truckload
rates,”
but
without
further
elaboration
or
detail.
now,
the
testimony
of
the
protesting
motor
carriers
that
is
set
forth
in
detail
carrier
by
carrier
in
the
examiner's
report
which
is
put
in
the
record.
it
was
summarized
in
the
commission's
report
at
pages
391
and
392
of
the
record
as
follows;
by
either
direct
or
joint-line
service,
motor
protestants
can
provide
service
to
substantially
all
the
points
involved
herein.
each
of
the
opposing
motor
carriers,
except
nelson
brothers,
as
a
common
carrier
and
each
operates
a
substantial
amount
of
equipment
suitable
for
the
transportation
of
the
commodities
here
involved.
although,
shippers
have
knowledge
of
the
availability
of
service
from
several
protestants,
none
of
the
protestants
has
participated
in
the
involved
traffic.
all
have
expressed
an
interest
in
participating
in
this
traffic
either
as
initial
or
connecting
carriers
on
both
inbound
and
outbound
shipments.
they
have
handled
both
large
and
small
shipments
of
the
type
of
traffic
here
involved,
and
are
willing
to
provide
multiple
pick
up
and
delivery
where
authorized.
so
in
that
context,
more
or
less
undisputed
facts,
the
commission
turned
to
apply
the
criteria
in
section
209
(b),
the
five
criteria
that
were
referred
to
this
morning.
looking
at
the
number
of
shippers
to
be
served
by
reddish,
the
commission
concluded
that
his
proposal
to
serve
only
three
shippers
failed
within
the
definition
of
contract
carrier
in
section
203.
then
turning
to
the
nature
of
the
service
proposed,
the
second
criteria,
the
commission
noted
that
the
shippers
require
a
motor
carrier
service
for
the
transportation
of
less
than
truckload
shipments
of
canned
goods
providing
multiple
pickups
and
deliveries.
they
had
found
protesting
carriers
are
authorized
to
serve
the
origin
points
involved
and
either
directly
or
through
interchange,
a
numerous
points
in
a
vast
33-state
destination
territory
in
which
applicant
desires
to
operate.
the
service
required
by
the
shippers,
the
commission
found,
does
not
seem
to
be
in
any
way
different
from
that
which
motor
common
carriers
are
rendering
daily
to
countless
other
shippers
of
the
same
or
similar
commodities.
this
appears
to
be
a
situation
of
which
the
service
proposed
and
shown
that
when
needed
could
be
performed
by
protesting
common
carriers
as
well
as
by
the
applicant.
and
we
submit
that
those
applicant
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
found
the
service
required
by
the
shippers
does
not
seem
to
be
in
any
way
different
from
that
which
motor
common
carriers
are
rendering
daily
to
countless
other
shippers
of
the
same
or
similar
commodities.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
and
of
course
one
thing
that
they
would
be
taken
into
account
would
be
that
in
sharp
contrast
with
j-t
and
the
highly
specialized
articles
thereabout.
we
are
now
dealing
with
one
of
the
most
common
items
of
commerce
in
the
country,
canned
food.
it
moves
in
commerce
in
a
volume
which
i
would
say
can
be
exceeded
only
by
a
coal,
grain
and
perhaps
automobiles.
a
huge
volume
of
canned
food
moves
in
commerce.
as
an
example,
the
railroad
share
in
1958,
under
a
bureau
of
the
census
study,
the
railroad
share
was
estimated
to
be
9
million
tons.
now,
this
commodity,
canned
food,
whether
it's
transported
by
the
applicant
reddish
or
by
the
protesting
motor
common
carriers
is
going
to
be
moved
in
ordinary
garden
variety
trailers.
trailers
pulled
by
a
tractor
and
no
special
equipment
is
--
it
doesn't
have
to
be
refrigerated
or
anything
like
that.
this
could
be
carried
anything
from
a
wheelbarrow
or
not.
it's
been
carried
through
the
years
by
all
types
of
carriers.
as
of
1958,
a
bureau
of
the
census
study
which
is
referred
to
in
our
brief,
showed
the
railroad
as
of
that
time
holding
42%
of
canned
seasonable
vegetables
for
higher
carriers
at
19%
and
private
carriers
at
36%.
as
of
1958,
private
carriage
had
dominated
the
haulers
up
to
250
miles
but
the
longer
haulers,
the
railroads
tended
to
dominate
particularly
to
their
extreme
distances
with
the
for-hire
motor
carrier
sector.
and
there's
another
conclusion
we
draw
from
that
that
by
no
means,
all
of
the
competitors
of
these
supporting
shippers
are
relying
solely
upon
private
or
contract
carriage,
in
immense
number,
must
even
be
used
in
the
relatively
inflexible
railroad
services.
in
these
circumstances,
the
commission
considered
the
effect
of
a
grant
upon
the
protesting
carriers.
at
that
point,
it
relied
primarily
upon
its
own
prior
decision,
the
j-t
case
concluding
that
authorization
of
a
new
carrier
to
transport
this
traffic
which
the
protesting
common
carriers
could
efficiently
handle
would
have
an
adverse
affect
upon
it.
now,
whether
or
not
the
commission
properly
applied
section
209,
in
so
concluding
was
argued
fully
in
j-t.
next,
the
commission
considered
the
effect
of
a
denial,
a
family
applicant
and
the
supporting
shippers.
and
in
so
doing,
it
rejected
or
certainly
it
heavily
discounted
the
shippers'
complaints
about
the
inadequacy
of
the
service
available
from
the
existing
common
carriers,
the
protesting
common
carriers.
the
commission
concluded,
and
this
is
in
the
record
at
page
394
that
aside
from
evidence
pertaining
to
rates,
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
substantial
showing
of
dissatisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
shippers
with
existing
service.
complaints
about
joint-line
service,
slow
transit
time
and
inability
to
arrange
multiple
pickups
and
deliveries
are
of
a
general
nature
and
are
substantiated
by
reference
to
specific
instances.
now,
although
protested
motor
carriers,
especially
those
operating
of
a
regular
roots
maybe
hindered
in
some
instances
by
their
authorities
and
the
nature
of
their
operations
from
achieving
complete
flexibility
in
affecting
pickups
and
deliveries.
the
supporting
shippers
have
failed
to
show
that
they
have
been
unable
to
obtain
reasonably
adequate
service
upon
request.
the
court
below
at
that
point
held
the
contrary.
it
said,
and
this
is
at
page
406
in
the
record,
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
shippers
have
not
used
the
services
of
the
protesting
carriers
because
these
services
are
inadequate.
the
court
below
also
held
and
this
is
at
page
410,
that
the
shippers
required
special
service
which
could
not
be
supplied
by
a
common
carrier.
now
the
commission
erred
as
a
matter
of
law
in
equating
the
reasonable
service
of
the
existing
common
carriers
with
the
special
service
which
the
court
found
that
the
shippers
needed.
now,
leaving
the
question
of
rates
aside,
we
submit
that
that
rationale
of
the
court
below
presents
a
very
serious
problem
for
the
entire
common
carrier
industry,
rail
and
motor
alike,
and
that's
because
we're
dealing
here
with
a
commodity
which
requires
no
special
equipment
or
handling,
which
is
one
of
the
largest
freight
movements
in
the
country.
we're
dealing
with
an
application
to
transport
it
for
substantial
shippers
to
points
in
33
states.
we
say
that
if
the
commission
must
grant
such
a
broad
application
or
such
a
common
commodity
and
on
such
a
generalized
showing,
it
will
have
to
do
so
in
similar
cases
because
on
this
record,
evaluating
this
record,
it's
fair
to
say
that
any
shipper
of
canned
food
can
make
the
same
general
criticisms
of
common
carrier
interline
service
on
less
than
truck
line
shipments,
and
any
such
shippers
could
testify
as
steele
did
that
he
and
his
customers
would
like
fast,
single
line
service
on
less
than
truckload
shipments
and
at
truckload
rates
every
shipment
in
the
country
would
like
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
often
does,
it
often
does.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
often
does.
as
a
generality,
one
line
service
by
a
single
carrier
from
origin
to
the
ultimate
destination
is
faster
than
interline
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
a
bit
later
in
his
report,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
shipper's
real
complaint
was
over
rates
not
over
service
and
that's
to
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would
reply
this
way,
that
in
this
generalized
evidence
and
some
of
those
at
page
194
and
195
and
again
at
198,
that
the
court
below
made
an
independent
evaluation
of
that.
we
submit
that
it
was
sufficiently
general
that
the
commission
was
not
compelled
to
accept
it
as
a
sufficient
demonstration
that
the
service
of
the
existing
common
carriers
was
not
reasonably
adequate.m
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
would
vary
from
case
to
case.
it
would
vary
for
example
as
to
whether
you
had
to
interline
with
a
total
of
three
carriers
or
whether
just
two.
the
motor
carriers
involved
in
the
interchange
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
dealt
with
some
generalized
examples
at
pages
194
and
195
of
the
record,
and
began
at
about
198,
but
i
think
(inaudible)
will
indicate
that
the
commission
was
entitled
to
call
it
unsubstantiated
generalities
or
at
least
not
going
beyond
the
objections
which
anybody
will
have
to
a
less
than
single
line
service
for
all
of
their
shipments.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
my
recollection
is
that
there
was
not,
there
was
not.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
five
or
six,
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
evidence
on
that
was
from
steele's
representative
who
testified
that
they
had
used
common
carriers
not
only
for
truckload
shipments
but
also
for
shipments
which
involved
deliveries
at
two
intermediate
lines
in
addition
to
that
destination.
that
was
a
precise
testimony
on
that
one.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
our
great
many
of
these
points,
there's
no
question,
they
would
have
to
interchange
with
other
carriers
and
no
one
of
these
carriers
are
on
protesting
motor
common
carriers,
serves
more
than
the
best,
a
good
fraction
of
this
33-state
area
and
no
motor
common
carrier
of
the
country
does.
we're
talking
about
three
quarters
of
the
united
states
now
being
covered
by
this
application.
now,
for
a
great
many
points
in
that
33-state
area;
there
would
have
to
be
an
interchange
of
at
least
one
carrier,
maybe
two.
it
was
not
developed
in
detail
but
we
can
say
that
just
from
the
size
of
the
area
involved.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
they
could
do
it
directly.
it
wasn't
too
specific
but
obviously
what
they
would
do,
they
would
accumulate
shipments
for
a
series
of
points
more
or
less
approximately
in
the
line
and
they
then
carry
them
through
and
drop
them
off
as
they
went.
and
then
of
course,
they
would
--
because
of
course
they
couldn't
take
a
one
time
shipment
by
itself
in
arkansas,
the
new
jersey
city
and
they
don't
pretend
to.
now
in
the
long
run,
economic
forces,
not
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
not
the
congress,
are
going
to
determine
whether
this
huge
chunk
of
traffic
is
going
to
be
carried
primarily
by
railroads
or
motor
carriers
or
private
carriers
or
contract
carriers.
but
in
the
meantime,
i
don't
think
the
commission
has
to
accelerate
that,
if
that
is
the
trend.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
accept
a
shipper's
statement
at
face
value
that
if
he
doesn't
get
a
contract
carrier
service,
he's
going
to
grant
for
private
carriage
and
perhaps
he
will
and
perhaps
he
won't.
the
case
was
before
this
court
two
years
ago,
the
general
motors
corporation
was
stating
that
well
they
might
go
into
private
carriage,
well
they
did.
and
this
court
properly
reminded
the
commission
that
it
shouldn't
rely
too
heavily
on
the
trucks
or
shippers
as
to
what
they
would
do
if
they
didn't
have
their
way.
and
as
the
drum
case
last
week,
and
as
mr.
steele's
experience
in
this
case
shows,
it's
one
thing
to
talk
about
private
carriage
but
it
isn't
always
a
bed
of
roses.
and
under
those
circumstances
–-
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
not
to
be
discouraged
in
any
affirmative
sense
because
the
interstate
commerce
act
leaves
every
shipper
free
carry
his
own
goods.
but
conversely,
the
whole
national
transportation
policy
is
to
encourage
the
development
of
a
system
of
public
transportation
which
can
serve
all
of
the
shippers
reasonably
and
economically.
and
in
this
context
--
sir
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
approved
his
findings
except
as
they
otherwise
indicated
in
their
own
report
which
they
often
do.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
i
give
you
an
example
of
that?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
he
had
the
pages
of
detailed
findings
as
to
the
statement
especially
testimony
of
the
protesting
common
carriers.
the
commission
didn't
reject
that.
it
adopted
it.
in
its
own
report,
it
simply
summarizes
its
purposes
in
one
paragraph.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
i
refer
to
that
in
the
statement
i
think
that
some
--
steele's
representatives
testified
that
some
of
his
customers,
he
did
not
say
how
many,
but
presumably
quite
a
few
required
deliveries
on
certain
days
and
that
some
would
require
shipments
at
specified
times
a
day.
i
suppose
do
you
know
to
tie
in
with
the
availability
of
the
shipper's
own
work
forces.
i
think
that
would
be
rather
common
in
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
suppose
to
some
extent,
they
have
to.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
mean
many
shippers
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
not
in
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
not
in
that
kind
of
detail
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
was
his
conclusion.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
examiner's
conclusion.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly.
and
the
commission
refused
to
give
weight
to
what
it
regards
as
such
a
generalized
objection
as
to
common
carrier
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
it
in
affect
said,
that
these
complaints
are
not
sufficiently
substantial,
and
in
fact,
it
discounted
them
as
being
the
sort
of
complaint
that
anybody
could
make
against
interline
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
don't
think
they
set
aside.
they
took
his
findings
based
--
which
in
turn
were
based
upon
rather
generalized
evidence.
and
the
commission
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would
say
rather
the
commission
was
evaluating
that
generalized
evidence
itself
and
stated
that,
“we
do
not
think
these
objections
are
enough
for
us
to
hold
that
the
services
which
could
be
provided
by
the
existing
common
carriers
would
not
be
reasonably
adequate.”
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
did
not
in
terms
reject
those
findings
rather
it
itself
characterized
the
limited
evidence.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
substance,
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
on
page
394
your
honor,
in
the
second
full
paragraph
about
this
sixth
line,
eight
line.
the
commission
concludes,
aside
from
evidence
pertaining
to
rates,
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
substantial
showing
of
dissatisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
shippers
with
existing
service
and
it
goes
on
to
characterize
or
rather
sparse
testimony
on
this
point.
it
says,
“complaints
about
joint-line
service”
slow
trends
of
time
and
inability
to
arrange
the
multiple
pickups
and
deliveries
are
of
a
general
nature.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
think
they
reverse
the
examiner
on
any
finding
as
to
what
the
facts
were.
mr
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh
i
think
that
perhaps
presumptions
on
my
part.
but
i
think
what
the
commission
has
done
in
its
report.
i
think
it's
a
quite
permissible
technique.
it
has
taken,
for
example
that
--
the
undisputed
but
general
testimony
of
pooles
(ph)
representative
and
it
just
put
its
own
characterization
on
it
as
not
being
sufficiently
substantial
in
character
to
preclude
the
commission
from
finding
that
the
existing
services
--
existing
carriers
could
perform
a
reasonable
adequate
service
on
this
commodity
canned
food.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that
except
by
getting
into
almost
a
semantic
circle.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
semantic
circle.
it
seems
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh
no,
no
indeed
there
was
not.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
the
commission's
report
assumes
that
the
kind
of
service
which
reddish
could
perform
and
assuming
what
the
record
does
sound
that
he
could
financially
do
so,
that
the
service
proposed
by
reddish
would
be
beneficial
to
the
shipper
because
what
was
offered
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly,
from
the
shipper's
point
of
view,
it
would
be
the
perfect
service.
it
would
be
the
ideal
that
the
single
line
shipment,
single
line
transportation
of
less
than
truckload
shipments
at
truckload
rates.
every
shipment
the
country
would
like
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
alright,
i
think
the
report
assumes
that
the
shipper
would
be
benefited.
but
the
report
goes
on
--
but
if
under
that
rationale
of
the
court
below
then
the
result
would
be
to
transfer
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
the
shippers
to
determine
whether
and
when
contract
carriage
is
consistent
to
the
public
interest
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
and
it
could
mean
in
a
situation
like
this
with
this
important
commodity,
that
you
turnover
to
the
food
canners
of
america.
the
choice
as
to
whether
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
my
reply
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
in
view
of
overall
broad
objectives,
the
national
transportation
policy
to
maintain
a
balanced,
efficient
system
available
to
all
the
shippers
not
just
to
those
who
are
able
to
get
contract
carriers
for
themselves.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
justice
black,
would
you
forgive
me
if
i
say
that
i
feel
honor
bound
to
heal
the
rest
of
the
time
to
mr.
rice.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
hardly
the
result.
we
would
have
expected
to
come
from
legislation
which
was
clearly
intended
to
tighten
up
on
what
congress
thought
was
an
excessive
growth
of
contract
carriage.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
hope
so.
i
no
longer
have
the
time
to
do
it
sir.
