mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
i
said
that
it
has
been
the
general
practice
of
the
commission
actually
since
virtually
the
inception
of
the
motor
carrier
regulation
in
1935,
to
give
due
consideration
to
the
adequacy
of
service
that
could
be
rendered
by
protesting
existing
carriers.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
in
part,
it's
whether
they
may
consider
that
and
then
(voice
overlap).
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
well,
we
would
certainly
say
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
yes.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
if
the
extreme
position
of
appellees
here
and
what
the
court
below
may
have
found
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
it
should
be
the
law
that
the
commission
may
not
consider
this
sort
of
showing
at
all.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
united
states,
no.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
they
agree
with
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
well
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
that
is
really
the
second
phase,
which
would
be
embraced
by
the
second
and
third
questions
whether
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
we
are
afraid
that
that
is
--
that
is
the
case
and
it
might
be
a
rather
abrupt
and
extreme
departure.
for
example,
the
appellees
have
argued
in
their
brief,
as
i
understand
their
ultimate
position,
that
if
a
contract
carrier
meets
the
definition
of
contract
carriage
in
terms
of
the
number
of
shippers
and
the
nature
of
the
service
proposed,
that
it
virtually
follows
that
the
certificate
or
that
the
permit
should
issue.
as
i
read
their
briefs,
there
are
a
number
of
statements,
which
it
seems
to
me,
definitely
lead
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
well,
they
--
frankly,
we
would
hope
at
the
very
least
to
secure
from
this
court
an
opinion,
which
would
be
much
more
clear
to
both
the
industry
and
to
the
commission
itself
with
respect
to
what
the
commission
may
or
may
not
do
under
these
amendments
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
and
we
find
the
opinion
below.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
we
say
that
decision
below
is
still
in
error
and
as
i
will
argue
to
your
honors,
the
commission's
findings
are
adequate
and
what
it
did
is
supported
by
the
record
and
is
within
the
ambit
of
its
discretion
and
judgment
as
the
expert
agency
in
this
field.
the
united
states
will
agree
--
will
agree
with
me
i
think
on
one
of
the
points,
that
is,
what
the
commission
did
with
respect
to
the
record
and
its
findings
concerning
the
adequacy
of
the
existing
service,
the
effect
on
the
supporting
shipper.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
the
united
states
will
disagree
with
us
on
what
--
and
a
ship
--
the
commission's
treatment
of
the
criterion
of
the
effect
of
a
grant
on
the
protesting
existing
common
carriers.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
we
think
it
clearly
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
harlan
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
and
i
think
--
especially
apparent,
at
least
it
is
to
us,
in
the
district
court's
criticism
of
what
the
commission
did
with
respect
to
this
effect
on
the
supporting
shipper.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
yes.
well,
that
would
bring
me
actually
to
my
argument
at
first
on
what
the
district
court
said
about
the
commission's
findings
and
conclusions
with
respect
to
the
effect
on
the
supporting
shipper
of
the
denial
and
what
the
commission
in
fact
did.
the
district
court
said,
as
we
read
this
opinion,
that
the
commission
had
ignored
the
affirmative
evidence
of
the
supporting
shipper,
boeing,
specific
needs
that
no
consideration
were
given
to
special
services,
which
the
district
court
said
in
fact
could
not
be
supplied
by
the
common
carriers
here.
and
that
the
commission
had
not
made
adequate
findings
respecting
the
distinct
transportation
needs
of
the
shipper.
i
think
from
the
rather
full
statement
of
facts
i
gave
yesterday
and
others
facts
from
the
record
and
which
the
commission
has
found
and
we
set
them
out
rather
fully
in
our
brief,
that
it's
just
not
true
that
the
commission
did
not
consider
the
evidence
of
the
shipper,
boeing's
needs,
and
that
it
did
not
consider
the
ability
of
the
protesting
common
carrier
to
meet
those
special
needs.
it
summarized
the
needs
in
great
detail
and
it
found
specifically
that
the
protesting
common
carrier
could
provide
exactly
the
same
sort
of
service
as
was
proposed
by
j-t,
the
appellant,
and
it
recited
in
detail
the
things
that
the
protesting
common
carrier
was
accustomed
to
do
and
would
do
in
this
case.
and
as
a
result,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
protesting
common
carrier
was
fully
able
to
meet
the
needs
of
boeing.
so,
i
think
it's
just
patent
from
the
commission's
report,
in
any
fair
reading
of
it,
that
it
is
just
not
the
case
that
the
commission
ignored
affirmative
evidence
of
boeing's
needs
and
that
it
made
findings
that
didn't
reflect
or
touch
those
needs,
that
--
that
the
report
is
the
full
answer
to
that.
the
court
also
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
suggests
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
in
the
commission's
brief,
pages
46
to
52,
we
address
ourselves
to
this
point,
to
recite
initially
what
the
court
said
about
the
commission's
treatment
of
this
and
then
we
point
out
what
the
commission
itself
said.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
on
page
50,
for
example,
we
set
out
from
the
commission
report
what
it
said
about
the
needs
of
boeing
and
what
the
applicant
is
proposing
to
do
for
boeing,
what
it's
been
doing
under
its
temporary
authority.
it
goes
on
to
set
out
what
u.s.a.c.
can
do
and
is
offering
to
do
here
and
then
at
--
to
go
back
to
page
47,
it
again
summarizes
in
some
detail
what
u.s.a.c.
is
in
a
position
to
do
and
is
offering
to
do.
and
i
think
it's
apparent
from
this
sort
of
treatment
in
the
report
that
it
has
fully
considered
what
the
shippers
has
testified
what
its
needs
are
and
has
fully
considered
what
u.s.a.c.
has
affirmatively
shown
that
it
could
and
would
do,
and
has
concluded
that
--
and
i'm
quoting,
“u.s.a.c.
is
fully
able
to
meet
the
shippers'
needs.”
and
that,
“in
view
of
the
adequacy
of
existing
common
carrier
service,
the
supporting
shipper
would
not
be
materially
affected
by
denial
of
the
applications.”
i
think
that's
all
the
commission
needs
to
find
on
this,
especially
after
this
rather
full
discussion.
so,
we're
satisfied
to
rely
on
these
few
pages
in
our
brief
and
the
--
and
the
court's
reading
of
the
commission
report
to
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
well
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
is
no.
the
commission
has
not
said
here.
the
shipper
says
it
needs
this,
but
we
really
don't
think
it
needs
that
that
the
common
carrier
can
do
something
else,
which
is
close
enough.
they're
not
substituting
their
judgment
for
the
shipper
here
with
respect
to
its
needs.
although,
i
don't
want
to
be
understood
as
conceding
that
the
commission
has
got
to
accept
uncritically,
everything
a
shipper
says
about
its
needs.
but
in
this
case,
on
this
record,
that
the
commission
recites
the
testimony
of
boeing
as
to
what
it
needs
and
what
has
been
done
for
it
on
the
temporary
authority
by
j-t.
and
then
the
commission
points
out
that
the
u.s.a.c.
can
do
the
same
things.
it's
a
specialized
carrier.
it's
a
common
carrier
but
specializes,
and
that's
what
85%
of
his
business
in
serving
the
aircraft
industry.
it's
accustomed
to
modifying
equipment,
dedicating
special
equipment,
meeting
production
schedules,
all
these
things,
boeing
says
it
needs.
it
has
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
the
terminal
right
at
the
origin
point
of
the
shipment
so
it
can
pick
them
up
on
a
phone
call.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
the
j-t
has
the
terminal
in
wichita,
which
is
where
boeing
is.
it
does
not
have
a
terminal
in
indianapolis.
the
reverse
is
true
of
u.s.a.c.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
from
this
record
that
the
protesting
common
carrier
u.s.a.c
has
indicated,
has
shown,
that
it
can
provide
service,
which
would
be
as
close
to
being
precisely
what
j-t
is
now
rendering
as
you
could
get
it.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
well,
the
commissioners
--
the
commission
is
the
finding
of
the
fact.
i
don't
have
to
tell
this
court
that.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
well
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
i
would
say
that
the
commission's
report
reflects
that
it
fully
set
forth
and
considered
the
shippers'
needs,
that
it
fully
set
forth
and
considered
the
service
that
is
proposed
to
be
provided
and
could
be
provided
by
the
protesting
common
carrier,
and
that
it
made
completely
adequate
findings
that
the
service
proposed
is
fully
able
to
meet
the
shippers'
needs.
i'll
go
further
to
say
that
those
findings
are
overwhelmingly
supported
by
this
record
and
that
certainly,
when
this
court
gets
into
the
record,
it
could
not
conclude
that
such
findings,
which
i
submit
are
adequate,
are
arbitrary
and
without
support
in
the
record.
i
think
that
they're
more
than
substantially
supported.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
they're
rather
overwhelmingly
supported
in
this
record.
i
don't
see
that
this
phase
of
the
commission
decision
is
a
problem
frankly.
i
--
again,
maybe
i'm
deferring
too
much
to
our
friends
in
the
united
states,
but
the
point
at
which
they
are
in
disagreement
with
the
commission's
decision
is
the
most
troublesome
point.
and
if
it
meets
the
pleasure
of
the
court,
since
my
time
is
rapidly
running
out,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
address
myself
to
that
final
point.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
now,
as
we
read
the
district
court's
opinion,
it's
its
view
that
the
commission
based
this
determination
of
the
effect
of
granting
the
permit
on
the
services
of
the
protesting
carriers,
on
the
basis
of:
one,
an
improper
presumption;
and
two,
its
conclusion
with
respect
to
this
affect
was
without
record
support.
that
is
the
district
court
seemed
to
feel
that,
for
example,
if
the
protesting
common
carrier
were
presently
enjoying
the
track,
such
that
a
grant
of
the
permit
would
result
in
the
traffic
being
withdrawn
from
the
protesting
common
carrier,
that
then
it
might
be
the
sort
of
a
diversion
of
traffic
which
could
constitute
a
sufficient
adverse
effect
that
the
commission
could
consider.
but
that
something
short
of
that,
it
just
wouldn't
satisfy
the
criterion
and
that
the
commission
on
something
short
of
that
would
probably
not
be
justified
in
finding
an
adverse
effect.
well,
the
protesting
common
carrier
is
not
enjoying
that
track
so
we
do
not
have
a
case
where
the
grant
of
the
permit
is
going
to
withdraw
on
the
protesting
common
carrier,
traffic,
which
is
now
transported.
i
think
the
united
states
generally
agrees
with
the
district
court.
it
too
feels
that
the
commission
has
based
its
finding
in
this
area
on
an
unsupported
presumption.
now,
the
basis
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
yes.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
i
will
read
you
the
language
in
the
commission's
report
in
which
what
is
presumption
lang
--
at
this
presumption
word
is
used.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
in
our
brief,
it's
a
language
quoted
from
the
commission's
report
at
pages
57
to
58
of
our
brief.
in
the
record,
it's
page
42.
the
commission
has
been
discussing
generally
the
background
and
what
it
has
done
in
the
past
and
towards
the
bottom
of
this
quotation
on
page
57
of
our
brief,
we
find
the
language,
“however,
we
believe
that
our
past
holdings
that
existing
carriers
are
entitled
to
transport
all
the
traffic
which
they
can
economically
and
efficiently
handle
before
additional
authority
is
granted
are
equally
valid
today
as
they
were
prior
to
the
1957
amendments
to
the
act.
there
is,
in
effect,
a
presumption
that
the
services
of
existing
carriers
will
be
adversely
affected
by
a
loss
of
'potential'
traffic,
even
if
they
may
not
have
handled
it
before.”
now,
that
is
a
sole
place
in
the
commission's
report
where
it
uses
this
presumption
language
and
the
court
will
note,
they
said,
“there
is,
in
effect,
a
presumption,”
in
effect
in
setting
--
to
set
off
the
commerce.
now,
what
the
commission
is
saying,
and
i
think
when
this
report
is
carefully
read
at
two
or
three
--
it
becomes
almost
redundant
on
this
point.
at
a
couple
of
places,
they've
discussed
the
national
transportation
policy
and
relate
this
sort
of
thinking
to
it.
and
what
the
commission
is
saying,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
generally
speaking,
authorizing
a
service
for
which
there
is
no
need,
that
is
that
the
existing
carriers
can
meet,
but
authorize
a
new
unneeded
competitive
service.
generally
speaking,
it
is
viewed
as
adversely
effecting
the
existing
carriers
because
it
takes
out
of
circulation,
potential
traffic,
which
might
become
available
to
them
and
that
this
sort
of
thing
if
it
were
to
occur
as
a
regular
matter
authorizing
an
unneeded
competitive
service
would
be
inconsistent
with
preserving
sound
economic
conditions
in
the
motor
transportation
industry.
and
i
think
that
sort
of
thinking
is
entirely
consistent
with
--
if
we
go
back
to
1935,
when
motor
carriers
are
put
on
to
regulation,
with
the
--
the
reasons
that
they
were
put
under
regulations
as
set
forth
so
succinctly
by
this
court
in
the
a.t.a.
case
at
345
u.s.,
where
they
pointed
out
it
was
the
over
competition,
the
instability
in
the
industry
which
it
caused
to
be
put
on
the
regulation.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
so
the
commission
in
general
is
of
the
belief,
that
it
is
--
will
not
advance
the
preservation
of
sound
economic
conditions
in
the
motor
carrier
industry
to
authorize
a
new
service
to
compete
with
carriers
already
in
the
field
where
the
new
service
is
not
meeting
a
need
that
the
existing
carriers
cannot
adequately
take
care
of.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
as
i
try
to
indicate
a
few
moments
ago,
in
this
case,
the
commission
has
found,
i
think
completely
ample
evidence
that
the
existing
common
carriers
here,
who
were
protesting
this
application
can
meet
the
distinct
needs
of
these
shippers.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
well,
the
existence
of
a
terminal
in
wichita
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
you
can
deliver
to
boeing's
plant.
frankly,
and
i
may
be
challenged
(voice
overlap).
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
yes.
i
think
this
terminal
at
wichita
thing,
in
a
transportation
sense,
is
kind
of
a
phony,
because
the
delivery
is
to
the
plant
of
boeing,
it's
not
to
a
carrier's
terminal
in
wichita
--
it's
still
a
plant
of
boeing.
the
only
convenience
to
a
shipper
and
the
carrier
having
a
terminal
in
the
same
town
where
his
industry
is
would
be
that
he
could
walk
over
there
and
talk
things
over,
but
you've
got
a
telephone
for
that.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
i'd
say
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
issue
as
there
may
be
in
reddish,
on
whether
the
commission
has
found
that
it's
the
reasonable
needs
that
are
met,
but
not
the
distinct
needs,
because
here
the
commission
has
said,
as
i
read
a
few
moments
ago,
the
protesting
carrier
is
fully
able
to
meet
the
needs
and
it
has
recited
the
needs
and
recited
what
the
carrier
can
do.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
on
this
record
that
the
distinct
precise
special
needs
can't
be
met
the
protesting
carrier.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
yes,
that's
our
position
and
we're
entirely
content
to
leave
the
commission's
report
to
speak
for
itself
in
the
record.
we
think
that
the
findings
are
there
on
the
records
supported.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
well,
private
carriers
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
first,
the
act
contemplates
limited
competition
in
the
first
place,
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
regulated
industry
and
regulated
rates.
i
would
like
to
think
it
more
in
terms
of
service.
i
think
the
function
of
a
contract
carrier
is
to
provide
some
specialized
and
tailored
service
to
a
shipper,
which
is
akin
to
what
it
might
provide
for
itself,
where
that
service
is
not
otherwise
available.
it's
an
alternative
to
going
into
private
carriage.
and
today,
other
contract
carriers
might
be
under
the
scene,
providing
the
same
service,
and
that
might
be
a
barrier
to
a
new
one
being
authorized
or
specialized
common
carriers
may
be
fully
able
to
provide
it.
i'd
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
and
on
the
other
hand,
i
would
like
to
say
something,
and
i'm
afraid
i've
cut
my
friend
mr.
rice
out
completely
here.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
would
say
that
they
must
take
all
of
the
factors
into
account
that
are
relevant
and
pertinent
to
a
particular
set
of
facts.
for
example,
the
fifth
factor,
the
changing
character
of
the
shippers'
requirements.
the
commission
pointed
out
was
not
pertinent
here.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
it
took
it
into
account.
he
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
was
aware
of
it.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
oh,
the
statute
says,
“in
determining
whether
a
grant
would
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
and
national
transportation
policy,
the
commission
shall
consider.”
now,
i
would
say
that
that's
pretty
mandatory
upon
the
commission
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
to
consider
those
things.
now,
what
weight
they
attach
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
to
these
is
not
spelled
out.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
mr.
frankfurter,
yes.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
it
certainly
does.
i
would
like
to
save
whatever
time
we
have
left
for
rebuttal.
