mr.
james
w.
wrape
chief
justice,
and
the
court
pleases.
there's
is
one
preliminary
matter
that
i'd
like
to
take
up
with
the
court.
on
october
the
9th,
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
in
docket
mc
108,
453
sub
22,
the
application
of
g
&
a
truck
lines
served
an
order,
this
was
only
a
week
or
so
ago
and
after
the
briefs
were
printed.
in
that
order,
we
believe
that
the
court
correctly
stated
the
law
and
applied
the
principles
of
section
209
as
we
believe
they
should
be
applied.
we
furnished
copies
of
that
report
to
all
parties.
we
furnished
copies
to
the
clerk
and
we
asked
leave
to
have
it
distributed
to
the
court
as
this
report
is
one
of
the
many
that
are
not
printed
in
the
permanent
found
reports
of
the
commission
and
we
believe
that
it
will
be
very
helpful
to
you
in
the
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes,
just
--
october
the
9th.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
on
the
same
point
and
it
applies
the
five
criteria
in
section
209
as
we
believe
and
say
they
should
have
been
applied
in
this
case.
if
the
court
pleases,
i
represent
j-t
transport
company
and
have
represented
them
throughout
this
proceeding
along
with
mr.
todd
who
represents
the
contract
carrier
conference,
we'll
attempt
to
divide
our
time
and
we
have
attempted
to
divide
our
argument.
i
intend
to
address
myself
to
the
record
as
made
in
the
case,
the
reports
of
the
commission,
the
decision
of
the
fine
court
in
kansas
city.
mr.
todd
will
be
happy
to
discuss
and
to
answer
any
questions
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
out
of
which
the
1957
amendments
evolved.
in
the
first
place,
i
should
state
and
i
want
to
state
it
as
shortly
as
i
can.
we
can't
quite
figure
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
in
this
case.
he
was
our
foremost
antagonist
in
the
lower
court
below.
he
did
not
appeal.
he
comes
here
and
i
believe
he
now
confesses
error
on
the
part
of
the
commission
and
to
some
extent,
he
supports
us.
into
some
extent,
he
supports
the
commission.
but
in
the
end,
he
asked
that
the
matter
be
remanded
and
the
case
decided
by
the
commission
in
the
light
of
his
brief.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
as
i
say,
i
believe
he
is
an
appellee
only
because
he
is
not
an
appellant.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
i'll
be
very
happy
to,
sir.
now,
with
respect
to
the
argument
and
the
briefs
advanced
and
filed
by
the
commission,
i
have
a
more
quarrel
--
more
of
a
quarrel
with
mr.
taylor
in
what
he
didn't
say
than
in
what
he
did
say.
this
--
the
j-t
transport
company
is
a
contract
carrier
who
has
devoted
its
20
years
of
existence
to
the
transportation
exclusively
of
aircraft
components.
we
don't
talk
about
aircraft
parts.
these
are
great,
big
components
or
assemblies
that
are
subcontracted
and
manufactured
at
a
place
apart
from
the
place
of
final
assembly.
and
then,
they
have
to
be
transported
to
the
production
line
and
they
are
put
into
the
big
air
freight.
the
particular
aircraft
assemblies,
or
components
as
we
sometime
call
them,
that
are
here
involved
are
parts
of
the
b-52
which
is
the
--
it
is
a
big
jet
transport
fighter
plane.
it's
one
of
the
type
that
met
with
the
disastrous
accident
this
past
weekend.
it
has
been
manufactured
since
1952
and
is
it
--
it
is
still
a
part
of
the
air
force's
production
of
fighter
planes.
the
particular
commodity
here
is
called
the
landing
gear
bulkhead.
that
is
a
great,
big
12-foot
by
16-foot
component
that
fits
up
into
the
airframe
from
which
the
wheels,
the
landing
gears
are
suspended.
it
is
made
of
magnesium,
titanium,
and
aluminum.
yet,
the
core,
the
aft
bulkhead
is
122
x
181
x
24
inches.
that
is
11
x
15
x
2
feet
wide.
the
other
one
is
slightly
smaller.
they
weigh
practically
nothing
considering
their
bulk,
their
weight
in
each
instance
is
under
1400
pounds.
they
are
very
expensive.
each
one
way
cost
about
$25,000.
now,
in
order
to
transport
a
component
of
this
size
over
the
highway,
in
a
vehicle
within
the
legal
limits,
is
a
problem
and
it
is
not
like
the
commission
would
have
you
think
that
it
is
something
you
throw
on
the
back
end
of
a
flatbed
truck
and
take
across
the
country
because
you
can.
it
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
sir?
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes
sir.
there
are
some
fine
pictures
of
the
components
in
the
record,
pages
144
to
140
--
or
pages
141
to
144
in
(inaudible).
the
picture
at
page
144
is
the
component
in
a
shipping
fixture.
the
shipping
fixture
goes
into
the
trailer
and
the
component
is
shipped
within
those
big
frames.
now,
the
--
as
i
say,
the
job
of
moving
this
over
the
highway
is
a
tremendous
one,
the
j-t
transport
company
in
their
long
experience
designed
a
trailer
which
was
a
highly
specialized
trailer.
it
had
to
be
because
one
of
these
components
which
was
11
feet
high
had
to
be
carried
upright
because
of
strain
or
stress.
so
we
had
to
get
a
component
that
is
11
feet
high
into
a
trailer
that
is
only
12.5
feet
at
its
highest
point
from
the
roadway.
so
they
developed
what
they
called
an
underslung
trailer.
that
means
one
part
of
the
trailer
drops
down
to
about
eight
inches
off
the
highway
and
the
floor,
the
rest
of
the
trailer
is
higher.
in
order
to
load
the
components
in
the
shipping
fixture,
into
the
trailer,
they
push
them
in
on
tracks.
when
they
would
get
this
component
over
the
underslung
portion
which
the
floor
which
had
been
raised,
they
had
an
electric
elevator
that
they
installed
in
each
one
of
these
trailers.
and
that
elevator
would
move
the
roof
and
the
--
and
the
floor
up
at
the
same
time
so
that
the
sunken
floor
was
leveled
with
the
rest
of
the
floor
so
that
the
component
could
be
pushed
in.
once
it
got
there,
the
elevator
lowers
the
top
and
the
floor
down
to
the
point
where
this
big
component
could
ride
safely
over
the
highway.
now,
in
addition
to
the
trailer
that
they
have,
they
also
designed
and
they
owned
and
they
furnished
these
shipping
fixtures,
copies
of
which
you
can
see
in
the
record
beginning
at
pages
141
and
144.
these
fixtures
were
designed
so
that
the
components
were
attached
to
them
in
a
way
to
simulate
the
attachment
of
these
same
components
when
they
go
into
the
airframe,
so
that
you
avoid
strains
and
stresses
in
transit.
these
components
are
highly
susceptible
to
damage
because
of
strain
or
stress.
if
they
are
jarred,
or
if
they
are
dropped
or
if
anything
lose
them,
so
as
to
cause
the
strain.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
sir?
mr.
james
w.
wrape
these
were
composed
of
a
light
--
a
very
light
metal.
now,
my
time
is
short.
i
could
tell
you
some
more
about
the
highly
specialized
nature
of
the
tractor
--
i
mean,
of
the
trailer
and
of
the
shipping
fixtures,
but
i
believe
that
along
with
the
pictures
will
demonstrate
what
i
mean.
this
was
no
simple
kind
of
an
operation.
it
was
a
highly
complex
operation.
now,
according
to
the
record
here,
the
shipment
moved
from
the
empty
trailer
or
the
trailer
with
the
shipping
fixtures
in
it,
moved
from
wichita
to
indianapolis
overnight,
from
indianapolis
after
it
was
loaded
back
to
wichita
overnight
as
against
a
rail
movement
of
some
three
or
seven
--
up
to
seven
days
transit
time.
now,
the
trailer
after
it
was
designed
and
built,
the
fixtures
after
they
were
designed
were
submitted
to
the
engineering
department
of
boeing,
who
under
our
contract
had
the
absolute
right
to
reject
either
the
trailer
or
of
the
shipping
fixtures
if
they
believe
that
any
damage
would
accrue
or
if
they
didn't
believe
that
they
were
entirely
proper.
in
other
words,
we
simply
acted
as
the
agent
and
we
did
for
boeing
what
boeing
would
have
done
by
--
for
itself
if
it
had
engaged
in
private
carriage.
now
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
no,
sir.
this
equipment
had
to
be
built.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
the
existing
carrier
offered
to
build
one.
now
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes,
sir.
there
are
four
ships
a
month
in
each
direction
and
with
overnight
service
it
would
just
about
to
make
it.
now
sir,
the
pictures
which
began
in
the
record
at
page
141
show
the
trailer
empty
with
the
electric
elevator
in
the
front
of
the
trailer.
you'll
notice
a
hole,
or
a
well
up
in
the
front,
that
is
the
underslung
portion,
the
floor
which
is
raised
by
the
elevator.
now,
on
page
142,
you
see
the
fixtures
loaded
with
the
components
and
in
the
trailer.
that
is
the
way
that
it
moved
from
indianapolis
to
wichita.
now,
at
page
143,
you
see
one
component
loaded
in
a
fixture
and
one
empty
fixture.
and
of
course
anyone
--
anyone
can
see
that
the
return
trip
with
the
empty
fixtures
is
not
what
we
ordinarily
call
deadhead.
that
is
the
movement
of
an
empty
unit
over
the
highway.
and
for
the
commission
to
insinuate
or
to
suggest
that
u.s.a.c.
could
have
eliminated
deadhead
miles,
in
this
operation,
it
is
impossible
because
it
requires
the
absolute
use
of
the
trailer
in
each
direction
one
with
the
empty
fixtures,
one
with
the
loaded
fixtures
in
the
other
direction.
it
is
a
two-way
movement,
although
the
components
are
only
handled
in
one
way,
in
one
direction.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
sir?
mr.
james
w.
wrape
well,
if
you'll
look
at
page
143
sir,
you
will
see
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
alright,
so
you'll
see
that
the
fixture,
the
empty
fixture,
completely
fills
up
one
half
of
the
trailer.
the
other
fixture
has
a
component
in
and
if
you
took
the
component
out,
the
fixture
would
likewise
occupy
the
other
half.
in
other
words,
coming
back
with
the
empty
fixtures,
you'll
require
a
full
trailer.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes
sir.
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
no,
sir.
that
is
right,
sir.
these
are
--
these
are
prominent
fixtures
and
the
record
shows
there
were
two
sets
where
there
were
--
there
were
four
trailers,
four
fixtures
owned
by
j-t
transport
co.
and
furnished
for
transportation
and
boeing
had
four
more
units
for
their
own
use
or
storage
in
their
plan.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes
sir.
it
--
i
will
touch
on
that
in
a
few
minutes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
in
light
of
that
point,
i
might
bring
it
out
here.
the
record
shows
that
each
of
these
b-52's
is
an
individual
airplane.
it
has
a
serial
number
and
every
component
bears
that
particular
serial
number.
each
component
is
manufactured
for
a
particular
airframe.
so,
when
the
production
line
begins
to
move,
these
components
move
in
to
wichita
on
a
schedule
so
that
at
the
proper
time
when
the
landing
gear
bulkheads
are
to
be
inserted
into
the
airframe,
they
must
be
there
at
that
time.
if
for
any
reason
they
are
not
there,
then
you
have
either
to
stop
the
production
line
and
wait
for
them
or
you
take
that
airframe
completely
out
of
the
line
and
then
put
an
out
of
sequence
installation
into
the
airplane
when
the
component
finally
arrives.
you
have
a
tremendous
delay
in
production
and
you
will
have
the
tremendous
expense
of
taking
that
big
airframe,
that
big
plane,
a
big
jet
52
out
of
the
line
and
over
--
and
set
it
aside
until
the
component
gets
there.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes
sir.
that's
--
it's
all
in
the
record
sir.
the
record,
and
a
practitioner
before
the
commission
is
a
very
complete
one.
it
isn't
very
long.
there
were
two
witnesses
for
the
applicant
and
two
or
three
carrier
witnesses
for
the
protesters.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes
sir,
it
is
fully
developed
there.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes
sir,
i
will
get
to
that,
yes.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
that
sir
and
with
respect
to
the
distinct
need
of
the
shipper
as
we
part
as
the
statute
mentions,
and
particularly
because
the
commission,
in
their
argument,
just
overlooked
it.
i'm
going
to
stop
right
here
on
the
account
of
my
time,
sir.
now,
with
respect
to
the
record,
the
traffic
director
for
boeing
testified,
mr.
solomon.
and
i
think
it
would
be
quicker
for
me
to
read
to
you
two
or
three
excerpt
from
his
testimony,
and
to
even
summarize
it.
at
page
89
in
the
record,
the
question
was
asked,
“did
that
mean
anything
to
you
in
determining
to
bring
about
the
filing
of
the
application
and
your
support
of
the
application?”
that
is
whether
it's
a
contract
carrier
or
not.
his
answer
was,
“yes,
it
did,
because
we
recognized
that
the
contact
carrier
can
dedicate
equipment
to
our
service.
the
type
of
equipment
that
we
want
and
we
feel
that
on
this
type
of
transportation,
it
is
the
best
thing
to
have
the
equipment
solely
dedicated
to
our
use.”
on
page
90,
in
response
to
the
question,
“do
you
have
contact
with
them
--”
that's
j-t,
“--daily
with
respect
to
their
operations?”
“yes.”
“does
the
maintenance
of
a
terminal
by
j-t
at
wichita
mean
anything
to
you?”
mr.
solomon's
answer,
“it
means
very
much
to
us,
in
as
much
as
the
type
of
operation
that
they
conduct
in
hauling
these
various
components
for
us.
we
find
the
daily
cooperation
that
we're
able
to
have
with
j-t
employees
at
wichita
is
very
helpful
to
us
and
is
i
would
say
necessary
to
the
successful
operation
of
this
type
of
service.”
in
response
to
the
question
--
is
this
time
of
transit
ability
important
to
you?”
he
said,
“normally,
in
manufacturing
airplane
parts,
there
are
many,
many
engineering
change
that
must
go
into
each
unit.
as
these
engineering
changes
are
incorporated,
they
have
to
lock
them
out
so
far
down
the
line,
and
if
you
have
a
longer
transit
time,
it
takes
you
that
much
longer
to
get
to
these
changes
in
the
picture.
in
other
words,
these
changes
mean
an
improvement
in
the
airplane
and
if
we
have
a
longer
transit
time,
it
takes
us
that
much
longer
to
get
these
changes
into
our
aircraft
that
we
are
rolling
off
the
production
line.”
and
in
response
to
the
question,
“how
do
you
regard
the
j-t
transport
company
in
your
scheme
of
operations?”
his
answer,
“well,
we
feel
they
are
just
merely
a
part
of
our
production
line
in
that
we
can
schedule
the
parts
right
from
our
manufacturer
and
the
shipments
are
moved
right
into
our
receiving
area
and
through
the
inspection
and
right
on
into
our
production.
so
they
are
actually
just
an
extension
of
our
production
line.”
and
in
response
to
the
question,
“will
you
tell
the
examiner
whether
or
not
boeing
believes
that
it
needs
the
surface
here
proposed
in
order
to
successfully
complete
its
contract?”
his
answer,
“we
feel
we
definitely
need
this
type
of
service
to
furnish
or
build
the
best
type
of
aircraft
that
we
can
for
the
united
states
air
force.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
no
sir.
i
think
it
was
sufficiently
stated,
it's
only
with
respect
to
their
past
unsatisfactory
service
and
i
believe
that
mr.
solomon
stated
his
position,
he
would
intend
to
go
into
other
remedy.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
oh,
certainly
sir.
as
i
stated,
i
believe
we
have
a
full
and
complete
record
here
from
a
practitioner
standpoint.
now
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
oh,
no
sir.
no,
there
couldn't
be
sir.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
that
is
uncontradicted.
the
only
thing
that
the
protestants
put
in,
they
were
carrier
witnesses,
was
their
availability
and
their
willingness
and
their
declarations
of
adequate
--
adequacy
in
their
service.
that's
the
only
--
that's
the
only
other
side
of
the
case.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
the
only
thing
that
the
protestants
put
into
the
record
was
their
willingness,
their
ability,
and
the
establishment
of
their
service.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
well,
their
willingness
to
handle
the
traffic.
i
was
going
to
get
to
that
mr.
justice,
and
it
might
be
a
good
place
here.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
well,
they
are
willing
--
able
and
the
willingness,
ability
and
willingness
of
course
was
the
old
test
that
was
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
they
are
talking
about
service,
in
general,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
i
have
challenged
the
commission
in
each
step
of
this
proceeding
to
point
out
one
fact
of
record
upon
which
they
based
their
conclusion
that
u.s.a.c.
said
they
would
dedicate
equipment
to
the
use
of
boeing.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
the
commission
says
yes.
if
they
will
dedicate
equipment
to
every
other
shipper
in
the
united
states
who
also
asks
for
it,
they
could
do
it.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
i
do
not
think
it
is
important
to
a
settlement
of
this
case.
but
as
i
say,
i
challenge
that
statement
of
the
commission
and
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record,
there
is
no
testimony
except
mr.
decker's
on
behalf
of
u.s.a.c
and
the
only
thing
he
says
in
response
to
--
he
has
an
affirmative
answer
in
response
to
a
question
of
counsel,
“would
you
station
a
modified
trailer
in
indianapolis?”
and
he
said,
“yes.”
he
does
not
say,
“i
will
dedicate
this
to
the
exclusion
of
some
six
or
seven
other
shippers”
he
bragged
about
having
in
indianapolis
and
saying
he
was
serving
in
order
to
prove
his
ability
to
perform
this
kind
of
service.
he
never
does
say
in
this
record
that,
“i
will
dedicate
a
piece
of
equipment
to
the
use
of
boeing,”
in
the
same
way
that
j-t
says,
“here
it
is.
you
use
it.
you
dispatch
it.
you
operate
it.
you
just
tell
us
what
to
do
and
we'll
do
it
for
you
as
the
same
as
you
do
it
yourself.
and
that
is
what
it
amounts
to.
now
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
--
counsel
for
the
commission
--
sir?
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
that's
the
only
interest
that
you
can
take
from
--
i
don't
think
they
setup
networks.
they
set
the
data
and
didn't
agree
to
dedicate.
they
caught
it
the
same
as
we
did
because
we
argued
it
before
the
court.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
when
you
say
service,
i
heartily
agree
with
you,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
when
you
say
service,
i
heartily
agree
with
you.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
the
service,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
they
said
that
--
the
court
said
that
the
record
didn't
support
a
statement
that
u.s.a.c
could
meet
the
distinct
needs
of
boeing
or
the
needs
of
boeing
or
as
disclosed
by
the
record.
i
think
you'll
find
that
sir
at
page
177
in
the
record
which
contains
the
court's
decision.
it
is
right
--
about
the
first
five
lines,
sir.
let
me
get
back
sir
to
my
argument.
i
do
not
have
very
much
time.
the
--
there's
only
one
protestant
here
and
that's
u.s.a.c.
i'm
figuring
we
have
the
railroads
and
we
had
three
or
four
heavy
haulers
who
wanted
to
give
a
multiple
line
service.
after
the
recommended
report
which
recommended
the
granting
of
the
application,
these
so-called
heavy
haulers
were
satisfied
with
it,
realized
they
couldn't
meet
the
needs
and
filed
no
exemptions.
the
railroad
objected
to
the
recommended
report
because
they
said
the
commodity
description
was
too
great,
it
was
for
airplane
parts,
and
they
wanted
--
restricted
the
landing
gear
bulkheads
to
which
we
agreed,
and
from
that
point
on,
we
only
have
one
protestant
and
that
is
u.s.a.c.
transport
company.
now,
the
u.s.a.c.
transport
company
were
fortunate
enough
to
secure
an
early
certificate
from
the
commission.
they
can
transport
aircraft
parts,
untraded
and
traded,
between
all
points
in
the
united
states
east
to
the
mississippi
river,
and
between
all
points
in
that
vast
area
on
the
one
hand,
and
all
points
west
of
the
river
on
the
other.
so
if
their
mere
existence
is
to
be
taken
as
a
basis
for
a
denial
of
a
contract
carrier
application,
you
can
see
it
is
impossible
that
there
ever
would
be
any
extension
of
any
contract
carrier
aircraft
service.
now,
i
think
i
have
touched
and
i
think
i
hope
i
have
demonstrated
that
we
have
no
question
here
about
deadheading
of
equipment.
that
is,
if
u.s.a.c.
was
able
to
get
this
business,
they
could
utilize
some
empty
miles
because
they
can't.
you
have
to
have
the
same
number
of
miles
in
the
use
of
the
unit
in
each
direction
because
one
way,
you
haul
a
complete
trailer
load
of
fixtures
and
the
other,
you'll
haul
the
fixtures
with
the
components
in
it.
now,
mr.
solomon
in
his
testimony
said
that
there
were
two
reasons
why
he
didn't
go
to
u.s.a.c.
one
was
this
general
dissatisfaction
with
prior
service
and
he
specifically
gauged
specific
instances.
and
the
second
was
a
tariff
provision.
that
tariff
provision
reads
and
i
quote,
“the
determination
of
the
equipment
to
be
used
to
transport
any
shipment
efficiently
and
safely
shall
rest
exclusively
with
the
carrier.”
in
a
most
unusual
statement,
the
commission
says,
“that
does
not
mean
anything.”
the
representative
at
the
hearing
says,
“we
will
provide
a
piece
of
equipment
and
dedicate
them.
well,
of
course,
the
record
does
not
show
that
he
said
they
dedicate
it.
and
anyway,
no
matter
what
he
says
at
the
hearing,
as
this
court
has
always
held
and
as
the
commission
has
maintained,
it's
the
rules
in
the
tariff
that
count,
that's
the
contract
of
the
common
carrier
with
his
customer,
and
he
can't
bury
that
by
anytime
of
an
oral
agreement
under
oath
in
a
hearing
or
otherwise.
now
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
location
for
the
terminal,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes
sir.
now
as
i
stated,
the
examiner,
immediately
after
the
hearing,
served
his
recommended
report,
recommending
the
granting
of
the
application.
before
the
report,
before
that
report
came
out,
in
fact,
before
the
hearing,
the
commission
had
granted
to
the
applicant
a
temporary
authority
to
engage
in
the
very
operation
that's
here
involved.
that
authority
was
granted
under
section
210
(a)
which
required
a
proof
of
an
urgent
and
immediate
need
and
a
showing
that
there
was
no
carrier
service
capable
of
meeting
that
need.
the
commission
granted
that
temporary
authority
over
the
violent
objection
of
u.s.a.c.
it's
still
effective
by
reason
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
now,
here
is
something
that
you
haven't
heard
and
something
that
i
believe
is
most
important
in
this
case.
in
the
first
commission
report
which
was
served
on
january
31,
1958,
the
commission,
the
record
shows
that
the
commission
took
six
printed
pages
in
which
to
adopt
the
recommended
report
of
the
examiner
to
restate
the
facts
and
then
to
proceed
to
deny
the
application
stating
and
i
read
the
one
paragraph,
“here
is
the
basis
for
the
denial
of
this
application
in
the
first
report.”
mr.
james
w.
wrape
page
26,
sir.
and
this
is
the
real
reason
why
the
application
was
denied
in
the
second
report.
the
commission
says,
“the
burden
is
upon
the
applicant
seeking
contract
carrier
authority
as
well
as
one
seeking
common
carrier
authority
to
establish
among
other
things
that
there
is
a
need
for
the
service
proposed
which
existing
carriers
cannot
or
will
not
need.
a
service
not
needed,
cannot
be
found
consistent
with
the
public
interest,
or
the
national
transportation
policy.”
now,
following
that
decision,
we
filed
a
petition
for
reconsideration
on
what
the
full
commission
was
denied.
then
we
went
to
court.
we
filed
a
suit
in
the
same
district
court
at
kansas
city
where
there
was
a
final
adjudication.
that
was
on
august
of
1959.
after
we
got
the
suit
filed
and
before
the
answer
date,
the
commission
came
up
with
a
decision
in
the
so-called
leary
case
that
is
cited
at
mr.
todd's
brief.
they
there
applied
somewhat
the
criteria
in
section
209
as
we
thought
it
should
be
and
we
thought
perhaps
they
had
finally
agreed
that
there
had
been
an
amendment.
and
incidentally
in
the
first
report,
there
is
not
one
mention
of
the
amendments
of
1957,
although
they
have
been
effective
for
three
months
when
that
order
issued.
they
simply
ignored
and
decided
it
on
the
same
basis
that
they
always
have.
well,
after
the
leary
case
came
out
and
then
--
it
appeared
that
perhaps
they
were
going
to
apply
these
standards
setup
in
209,
we
filed
a
successive
petition.
that
is
one
that
is
not
ordinarily
allowed
under
the
rules
and
we
filed
it
while
the
case
was
still
in
court,
much
to
our
surprise
and
we
were
very
happy.
the
commission
promptly
issued
an
order
setting
aside
and
reopening
the
--
or
issued
an
order
reopening
the
proceedings
for
further
disposition
on
the
same
record.
so,
we
by
agreement
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
other
parties,
we
took
a
nonsuit
without
prejudice
in
the
district
court.
then
along
came
the
second
order
which
is
the
one
that
has
been
discussed
here.
we
found
out
of
course
that
when
we
filed
that
successive
petition,
we
made
our
first
mistake,
because
it
gave
the
interstate
commerce
commission
its
opportunity
in
the
second
order
to
prepare
and
file
its
first
brief
in
this
litigation.
we
say
that
the
second
order
is
simply
--
well,
first,
in
the
second
order,
in
the
head
note,
which
the
commission
prepares,
it
starts
out
and
it
says,
“we
affirm
our
decision
in
the
first
order.”
in
the
second
order,
they
specifically
provide
in
the
order
itself
that
the
first
order
is
still
valid.
now,
in
the
second
order,
they
are
trying
to
explain
what
was
so
clear
and
cogently
stated
on
--
in
the
first
order
that
the
reason
why
the
application
was
denied
was
because
there
was
an
existing
carrier.
now
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes,
sir.
now
sir,
you
say
the
whole
commission,
it
wasn't
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes,
sir.
well,
the
first
one
that's
done
before
the
commission
entirely,
do
they
denied
our
petition
for
reconsideration.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
the
--
division
1
wrote
the
order
but
the
full
commission
denied
our
petition
to
reconsider
that
order,
so
it
was
their
order.
now,
the
second
order
is
only
the
order
of
four
commissioners.
the
other
11
commissioners
either
didn't
participate
or
they
concurred
with
--
separating
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
(inaudible)
freas
and
commissioners
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
there
were
seven,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
and
four
of
the
seven,
it
is
their
report
and
not
the
report
of
the
others.
now
sir,
i
do
not
think
that,
in
view
of
the
time,
that
it
would
do
anything
for
me
to
discuss
the
findings
of
the
division.
it's
there
before
you.
i
think,
as
the
court
said,
it's
apparent
that
they
were
simply
giving
reasons
in
lawyer's
language,
not
administrative
language
as
to
why
their
first
decision
was
valid.
now,
we
filed
a
second
suit
and
we
presented
it
to
circuit
judges
johnson
and
mathes
and
district
judge
smith.
and
their
decision
is
like,
what
is
the
decision
that
is
now
before
you?
that
decision
--
i
have
no
apologies
to
make
for.
i
believe
it
is
a
fine
decision
and
it
stands
on
its
own
feet
and
needs
no
defense
from
me.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
yes,
sir.
and
the
--
mr.
james
w.
wrape
the
court
says,
“with
respect
to
the
commission's
findings
on
criteria
4
that
they
applied
the
improper
standard.
now,
the
gist
of
that
court
decision,
i
think
i
can
state
very
briefly,
i've
been
living
with
it
for
a
long
time.
it
does
not
hold
that
the
commission
cannot
or
shall
not
consider
the
existing
--
the
existence
of
protesting
carriers,
the
willingness
and
ability
of
protesting
carriers
or
the
adequacy
of
the
service
of
the
protesting
carriers
but
it
simply
says
that
those
factors
cannot
be
considered
in
lieu
or
instead
of
the
five
additional
standards
prescribed
by
209
(b).
now,
i
can
well
understand
that
the
commission
in
beginning
to
consider
criteria
three,
that
is
the
effect
of
the
granting
of
the
application
upon
the
services
and
that's
an
important
word,
of
protesting
carrier.
they
first
have
to
determine
that
there
was
a
carrier.
then
that
that
carrier
was
willing
and
able
to
perform
a
reasonably
adequate
service.
all
right,
now
having
found
that,
they
proceed
to
the
real
question.
what
is
the
--
what
rule
granting
of
the
effect?
what
effect
will
a
granting
of
the
application
have
on
the
services
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
first
three
factors
were
answered
in
the
affirmative.
it
does
not
--
if
it's
not
adverse,
we
stop
right
there.
if
it
is
adverse,
then
they
weigh
that
along
with
the
other
four.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
no
sir,
no,
they've
got
the
4.
but
when,
they've
got
to
4,
they
answered
four
by
saying
that
the
service
of
u.s.a.c
was
adequate.
but
that's
not
--
that's
not
the
question.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
no
sir,
no,
it
is
the
effect
--
a
denial
would
have
on
the
shipper.
now,
this
case
that
we
gave
you
today
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
is
meant
by
criteria
4.
in
the
g
&
a
case,
the
shipper
had
three
plants.
they
were
all
served
by
common
carriers.
the
applicant
served
two
and
he
wanted
to
serve
the
third
because
they
wanted
to
mix
the
loads
and
have
split
loads,
split
pickups,
and
split
deliveries.
so,
and
the
reason
why
the
shipper
wanted
that
was
because
of
economic
reasons
and
his
distribution
reasons.
so
a
denial
of
that
application
would
have
severely
and
adversely
affected
the
shipper
because
he
would
not
be
able
to
practice
the
most
economical
operation
are
the
best
distribution
plans.
i
have
taken
up
way
more
than
my
time.
mr.
james
w.
wrape
oh,
but
let's
still
get
to
the
