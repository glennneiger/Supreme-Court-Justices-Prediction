what

that

something
i
would
think
of
as
in
the
nature
of
a
distinctive

that
that

needed.
in

you
are
arguing
on
the

that
this

has
fully
met,
the

has
fully
met
its

not
its
burden

a

is
there
any

that's
the
reason
i'm
asking

the
question.
maybe
it
means
that
congress
decided
that's
what
i
want
you
to
say
one
way

or
discuss
one
way

the
other
if
you
will.
congress
decided
that

that
could
be
shown
in

a
particular

could

out

was

it
had.

about

particular
of

inherently
so
much
easier
performed
that
your
knowledge
rate
would
be
less

you're
not

would
that
not

a
permissible
element

are
you
rejecting
mr.

argument,
which
i
understand
the
basis

part
on
the
fact
that
what
they
were
really
trying

get
here
was
cheaper

justice

may
i
ask
you
one
question
on
that
because
of
the
point

i
was
trying
to
ask,
suppose
that
was
the
only
point?
justice

that
was
the
only
point
they
had
but
they
wanted
to
say
and
prove
that
was
so
much
cheaper
to
the
carrier
by
this
method
that
inherently
they
could
do
it
a
lot
cheaper
and
they
want
to
get
the
advantage
of
it.
would
you
say
they
abide
from
doing
that
in
this
kind
of
proceedings
and
that
would
have
no
influence?
justice

well,
they
have
two
types
here,
less
than

less
than
truckload
and
truckload.
justice
hugo

black
would
you
say
that
if
it's
to
be
admitted
beyond
all
doubt
much
cheaper
the
carrier
by
less-than-truckload,
they
made
a
contract
to
somebody
to
carry
by
less-than-truckload
then
common
carrier
one
takes
them
before
they
could
make
that
contract,
that
they
would

barred

making

contract

the
advantage

the
cheap
advantage
they
would
get,

the
only
advantage
they
would
get
would
be
cheaper

rate

was
there's
any
