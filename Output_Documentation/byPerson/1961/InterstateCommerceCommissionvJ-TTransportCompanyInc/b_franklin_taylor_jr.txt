may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
argue
for
the
interstate

commission,
and
mr.
roland

argue
for
the
other

the
regular
common

transport
company.
this
case
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court,
setting
aside
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
commission's
order
denied
an
application
by
j-t
transport
company
for
contract
carrier,
extension
of
service
permit.
this
case
together
with
the
reddish
case
to
be
argued
following
the
argument
of
this
case,
presents
important
questions
respecting
the
interpretation
of
the
1957
amendments,
sections
203
(a)
(15)
and
209
(b)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
section
203
(a)
(15)
defines
the
term
“contract
carrier
by
motor
vehicles”.
section
209
(b)
prescribes
the
standard
to
be
applied
by
the
commission
in
passing
upon
applications
for
contract
carrier
permits.
it
sets
forth
five
criteria
which
the
commission
shall
consider
in
applying
the
governing
standard.
these
statutory
provisions
are
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
the
commission's
brief
at
pages
65
and
66.
they
provide,
in
important
part,
as
follows:
section
203
(a)
(15)
as
amended,
defines
a
contract
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
as
any
person
which
engages
in
transportation
by
motor
vehicle
of
passengers
or
property
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
for
compensation
other
than
transportation
as
a
common
carrier.
such
transportation
to
be
under
continuing
contracts
with
one
person
or
a
limited
number
of
persons
either
(a),
for
the
furnishing
of
transportation
services
to
the
assignment
of
motor
vehicles
for
a
continuing
period
of
time,
the
exclusive
use
of
each
person
served
or
(b),
for
the
furnishing
of
transportation
services
designed
to
meet
the
distinct
need
of
each
individual
customer.
section
209
(b)
as
amended
provides
that
a
permit
shall
be
issued
to
any
qualified
applicant
who
is
fit,
willing,
and
able
properly
to
perform
the
service
of
a
contract
carrier
and
to
conform
to
requirements
of
the
act
and
commission
regulations,
where
the
proposed
operation
will
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
in
the
national
transportation
policy
declared
in
the
act,
otherwise,
such
application
shall
be
denied.
section
209
(b)
goes
on
to
state
that
in
determining
whether
issuance
of
a
permit
will
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
in
the
national
transportation
policy,
the
commission
shall
consider:
(1)
the
number
of
shippers
to
be
served
by
the
applicant,
(2)
the
nature
of
the
service
proposed,
(3)
the
effect
which
granting
the
permit
would
have
upon
the
services
of
the
protesting
carriers,
and
(4)
the
effect
which
denying
the
permit
would
have
upon
the
applicant
and/or
its
shipper
and
(5)
the
changing
character
of
that
shipper's
requirements.
in
this
case,
the
commission
found
that
the
applicant,
j-t
transport's
proposed
operations
met
the
definition
of
contract
carriage.
it
found
j-t
qualified
in
terms
of
the
number
of
shippers
to
be
served
and
the
nature
of
the
service
proposed.
it
also
found
that
the
character
of
the
shipper's
transportation
requirements
is
not
such
as
to
preclude
their
performance
by
a
common
carrier.
the
commission
found
that
the
principal
common
carrier
protestant
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
you
mean
whether
the
transportation
requirements
could
also
be
met
by
a
common
carrier?
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
that
the
character
of
the
shipper's
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
character
of
the
shipper's
transportation
requirements
is
not
such
as
to
preclude
their
performance
by
a
common
carrier.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
the
commission
was
merely
saying
there
that
this
sort
of
service
may
be
rendered
by
contract
carriers
and
it
also
may
be
rendered
by
common
carriers.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
the
protesting
carriers
in
this
case
were
common
carriers.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
well,
it
is
involved.
i'm
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
no,
it's
existing
carriers
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
specifically
the
effect
which
granting
the
permit
would
have
upon
the
services
of
the
protesting
carriers.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
so
having
found
that
j-t
qualified
and
that
the
transportation
could
also
based
--
performed
by
a
common
carrier,
the
commission
found
that
the
principal
common
carrier
protestant
is
fully
able
to
meet
the
transportation
requirements
of
the
shipper.
consequently,
denial
of
the
permit
would
have
no
material
adverse
effect
on
that
shipper,
then
concluding
that
the
preservation
of
sound
economic
conditions
and
transportation
required
that
existing
carriers
should
be
afforded
the
opportunity
to
transport
available
traffic
which
they
can
handle
adequately
before
a
new
competitive
service
is
authorized.
the
commission
found
that
granting
the
permit
would
adversely
affect
the
protesting
carrier
in
this
instance
and
that
the
potential
loss
of
traffic
to
that
carrier
outweighs
any
detriment
to
the
applicant
flowing
from
a
denial
of
the
application.
as
a
consequence
of
these
findings,
the
commission
made
the
ultimate
finding
that
to
authorize
the
proposed
operations
will
not
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
and
the
national
transpiration
policy.
on
the
basis
of
its
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
1957
amendments
and
the
language
of
the
five
criteria
in
section
209
(b),
the
district
court
held
that
in
considering
the
ability
and
willingness
of
existing
common
carriers
to
provide
service
which
would
meet
the
shipper's
transportation
requirements,
the
commission
had
erred
by
injecting
a
sixth
test
specifically
rejected
by
congress.
the
court
also
held
that
the
commission's
findings
respecting
the
effect
of
a
denial
upon
the
supporting
shipper
were
in
error.
it
held
that
this
commission
had
improperly
imposed
upon
the
applicant
and
its
shipper,
the
burden
of
showing
the
inadequacy
of
the
existing
common
carrier
service.
that
the
commission
had
ignored
evidence
of
specific
needs
which
the
court
found
could
not
in
fact
be
met
by
the
protesting
common
carrier,
and
that
the
commission
had
failed
to
make
adequate
findings
in
terms
of
the
shipper's
distinct
needs.
finally,
the
court
held
that
the
commission's
finding
of
an
adverse
effect
on
the
protesting
carrier
was
based
on
an
improper
presumption
and
is
without
record
support
since
the
protestant
is
not
presently
handling
the
traffic,
and
consequently
the
grant
of
an
application
to
the
contract
carrier
would
not
divert
present
traffic
away
from
the
protesting
common
carrier.
in
our
view,
this
case
then
presents
three
questions.
first,
whether
the
commission
may
consider
an
affirmative
showing
by
a
protesting
common
carrier
that
it
is
able
and
willing
to
provide
a
transportation
service
adequate
to
meet
the
transportation
requirements
of
the
shipper
supporting
the
application
for
a
contract
carrier
permit.
second,
whether
in
finding
that
denying
the
application
will
not
adversely
affect
the
supporting
shipper.
the
commission
erred
by,
(1)
placing
upon
the
applicant
and
its
shipper,
the
burden
of
showing
the
inadequacy
of
existing
service,
(2)
by
ignoring
evidence
of
specific
needs
which
could
not
be
met
by
the
protesting
carrier
and
(3)
by
failing
to
make
findings
as
to
those
specific
needs.
the
third
question
is
whether
the
commission
was
entitled
to
conclude
that
where
existing
common
carrier
service
is
adequate
to
meet
the
shipper's
needs,
granting
the
permit
would
be
inimical
to
the
preservation
of
sound
economic
conditions
in
transportation.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
third,
is
whether
the
commission
was
entitled
to
conclude
as
a
matter
of
judgment
and
discretion
on
the
record
before
it
that
where
the
existing
common
carrier
service
is
adequate
to
meet
the
shipper's
needs,
granting
the
permits
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
preservation
of
sound
economic
conditions
in
transportation
and
would
adversely
affect
the
services
of
the
protesting
common
carrier.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
the
commission
stated
this
--
in
this
case
as
a
proposition
generally
applicable.
the
quarrel
that
we
have
with
the
united
states
is
almost
entirely
on
this
third
question
and
the
united
states
feeling
that
the
commission
reached
its
conclusion
here
on
the
basis
of
a
presumption
which
did
not
reflect
particular
facts
in
this
particular
case
and
we
are
of
course
disagreeing
and
i
would
develop
that
point
fully
when
i
reach
it.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
essentially
undisputed.
the
appellee,
j-t
transport
company
has
operated
for
a
number
of
years
as
a
regular
route
carrier
by
motor
vehicle,
carrying
uncrated
aircraft
parts
between
various
points
in
midwestern
and
western
states.
it
has
been
issued
some
16
permits
between
july
1953
and
january
1957
for
that
purpose.
by
an
application
filed
in
march
of
1957,
j-t
sought
a
permit
to
operate
as
a
contract
carrier
of
aircraft
landing
gear
bulkheads,
uncrated,
requiring
special
handling
and
equipment
over
irregular
routes
from
indianapolis,
indiana
to
wichita,
kansas.
at
the
hearing
on
the
application,
the
wichita
division,
a
boeing
airplane
company
which
is
the
consignee
of
the
bulkheads
supported
the
grant
of
the
permit.
several
motor
common
carriers
appeared
as
protestants.
now,
a
landing
gear
bulkhead
weighs
about
1380
pounds.
it's
worth
about
$24,000.
four
bulkheads
constitute
a
load
on
a
trailer
hauled
by
a
truck
tractor.
they
are
manufactured
for
boeing
at
indianapolis
by
a
subcontractor
and
delivered
to
boeing
at
wichita
for
installation
in
b-52
airplanes.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
which
took
place
in
may
1957,
j-t
had
been
transporting
the
bulkheads
for
about
four
months
under
temporary
authority
issued
by
the
commission.
it
was
averaging
slightly
less
than
four
loads
per
month
and
that
is
that
it
carried
14
loads
in
the
slightly
less
than
four
months.
the
transportation
has
been
accomplished
under
the
temporary
authority
and
has
proposed
to
be
accomplished
under
the
permit
sought
in
this
case
by
the
use
of
specially
designed
closed
top
trailers,
equipped
with
shipping
fixtures,
designed
by
j-t,
the
applicant,
with
the
aid
of
boeing.
the
equipment
is
assigned
to
the
exclusive
use
of
the
shipper.
j-t
has
a
terminal
at
wichita,
but
none
at
indianapolis,
the
origin
point
of
the
shippers.
thus,
j-t
must
deadhead
its
equipment
700
miles
to
indianapolis
in
order
to
pick
up
each
shipment.
however,
the
record
showed
that
boeing
knows
sufficiently
far
in
advance
of
a
particular
movement
to
give
j-t
ample
notice
in
order
that
it
may
move
its
equipment
to
700
miles
to
indianapolis,
transport
the
bulkheads
back
to
wichita,
and
still
meet
boeing's
production
schedules.
prior
to
the
inauguration
of
j-t's
service
under
its
temporary
authority,
railroads
were
used,
but
the
record
reflects
dissatisfaction
on
the
part
of
boeing
with
the
rail
service
principally
because
there
was
a
necessity
of
constructing
special
containers
in
which
to
put
the
bulkheads
when
they
were
transported
and
that
that
was
a
costly
operation.
the
principal
protesting
carrier
in
this
case,
u.
s.
a.
c.
transport
company
is
a
motor
common
carrier.
since
january
1950,
it
has
held
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
transport
over
irregular
routes,
aircraft
parts
crated
or
uncrated,
restricted
to
parts
requiring
special
equipment
or
handling
by
reason
of
size,
weight
or
fragile
nature.
the
geographical
scope
of
u.
s.
a.
c.'s
certificate
embraces
the
instant
transportation
between
indianapolis
and
wichita.
the
record
shows
and
the
commission's
findings
in
accordance
with
this
following
statement
of
facts
with
respect
u.
s.
a.
c.'s
capabilities
and
past
performance.
u.
s.
a.
c.
specialized
in
serving
the
aircraft
industry
for
several
years.
it
is
accustomed
to
modifying
its
equipment
to
meet
specific
transportation
requirements
of
particular
aircraft
manufacturers
and
it
has
done
so
many
times
in
the
past.
it
operates
more
than
170
tractors
and
over
225
trailers
including
trailers
which
would
be
readily
adaptable
for
the
transportation
of
the
traffic
involved
in
this
case.
if
tended
the
traffic,
it
would
modify
and
make
available
whatever
equipment
is
necessary
to
meet
the
shipper's
transportation
requirements.
it
has
numerous
terminals
throughout
the
country.
while
it
has
no
terminal
at
wichita,
it
does
have
a
terminal
at
indianapolis
where
the
shipments
originate.
consequently,
it
would
not
have
to
deadhead
its
equipments
700
miles
to
pickup
the
shipments.
it
is
willing
to
station
at
indianapolis,
a
suitable
closed
type
van
modified
and
with
fixtures
installed
to
move
the
traffic.
it
has
idle
equipment
in
indianapolis
and
must
deadhead
other
movements,
considerable
equipment
out
of
there.
its
drivers
are
required
to
have
security
clearance
and
that's
true
of
j-t's
drivers
and
apparently,
it's
a
requirement
in
order
to
handle
this
type
of
traffic
and
enter
the
boeing
plant.
although
boeing
knew
of
the
services
of
u.
s.
a.
c.,
it
didn't
try
them
for
the
indianapolis
to
wichita
movement.
generally,
it
gave
three
reasons.
there
was
a
testimony
about
an
allegedly
unsatisfactory
experience
in
using
u.
s.
a.
c.
at
another
place
in
connection
with
other
traffic
in
1953,
four
years
before
the
hearing.
the
witness
was
unable
to
say
whether
the
damage
incurred
at
that
time
was
a
fault
of
the
carrier
or
the
shipper,
what
recovery
was
made
or
any
of
the
details,
really
and
the
examiner
shut
off
a
cross-examination
on
the
grounds
that
this
was
too
remote
in
time
to
have
any
bearing
on
the
present
application.
the
second
reason
given
was
that
u.
s.
a.
c.'s
tariff
contains
a
provision
which
says
that
it
may
exercise
control
over
the
type
of
equipment
to
be
used.
now,
u.
s.
a.
c.
witness
explained
the
purpose
of
that
provision
as
being
merely
to
ensure
that
its
equipment
would
not
be
overloaded
such
that
there
might
be
damage
to
traffic
or
unsatisfactory
safety
conditions
to
give
it
a
minimal
control
over
its
equipment
since
it
is
doing
the
hauling
and
the
commission
specifically
found
that
this
sort
of
tariff
provision
was
no
impediment
in
view
of
u.
s.
a.
c.'s
express
willingness
to
specifically
modify
and
make
available
the
necessary
special
equipment
to
handle
movements
in
this
case.
the
third
objection
offered
by
the
shipper
for
not
having
tried
the
services
of
u.
s.
a.
c.
was
that
u.
s.
a.
c.
had
no
terminal
in
wichita
where
boeing
is
located.
but
as
i
have
pointed
out,
it
did
have
a
terminal
in
indianapolis
where
the
shipments
originate
and
it
has
a
terminal
in
topeka
kansas
which
is
about
a
170
miles
in
wichita,
and
of
course,
telephonic
communication
is
always
available
to
talk
with
the
u.
s.
a.
c.
people
so
that
the
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
this
case,
there's
no
cost
involved
or
rates.
rates
and
cost
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
--
are
not
a
problem.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
about
the
rates
being
available
to
boeing
--
made
available
to
boeing
by
the
various
carriers
as
having
anything
to
do
with
this,
no.
now
in
the
reddish
case
there
is
that
problem,
but
consequently
the
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
yes.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
those
were
the
reasons
that
boeing
gave
for
not
having
tried
the
services
of
u.
s.
a.
c.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
whittaker.
it's
a
--
it's
a
common
carrier
which
specializes
in
serving
the
aircraft
industry.
it
serves
a
number
of
aircraft
manufacturers,
lockheed
among
others.
and
as
i've
noted
in
the
--
the
record
shows
that
it
--
it's
accustomed
to
modifying
its
equipment
to
handle
special
types
of
traffic.
it's
authorized
to
do
so.
and
in
the
record,
there
are
some
photographs
of
some
of
the
equipment
that
u.
s.
a.
c.
has
showing
the
highly
specialized
nature
and
the
varying
nature
of
their
equipment.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
that
boeing
would
have
to
use
u.
s.
a.
c.
or
the
railroads
which
it
had
been
using
before
for
20
months
before
this
temporary
authority
operation
of
j-t
or
there
was
some
other
testimony
in
the
record
with
respecting
two
other
common
carriers
who
could
offer
a
joint
line
service,
which
they
testified
would
be
able
to
meet
the
requirements
of
boeing.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
no.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
it
means
that
the
boeing
would
be
restricted
to
those
carriers
who
are
presently
in
the
field,
authorized
to
provide
the
service,
and
as
the
commission
found
fully
capable
of
providing.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
or
going
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
as
the
commission
develops
at
considerable
length
and
--
and
probably
redundantly
in
its
report,
that
generally
speaking,
absent
peculiar
facts
in
this
specific
case
the
--
the
transportation
industry
will
be
best
served.
if
the
presently
permitted
and
existing
carriers
are
given
the
opportunity
to
haul
traffic
which
they
can
adequately
haul
before
a
new
competitive
service
is
authorized,
and
i
suppose
that
goes
back
to
the
original
problems
which
gave
rise
to
the
enactment
of
the
motor
carrier
right
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
ata
case
in
344
u.s.
over
competition
and
an
unsettled
rate
picture
were
factors
which
moved
the
congress
to
put
the
motor
carrier
industry
under
regulation.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
precisely,
and
the
commission
made
--
related
it
specifically
to
that
policy
which
is
specifically
mentioned
in
the
governing
standard
of
the
five
criteria
we
have
in
209
(b)
are
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
the
application
would
meet
the
standard
of
consistency
with
the
public
interest
in
the
national
transportation
policy.
that
is
the
standard,
the
criteria
are
implementing
factors.
well,
the
threshold
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
commission
is
precluded
by
these
1957
amendments
from
giving
any
consideration
to
a
showing
by
a
protesting
common
carrier
that
it's
able
and
willing
to
provide
service
adequate
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
shipper,
supporting
the
contract
carrier
application.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
it's
not
presently
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
we
say
that
it
certainly
did
not
take
away
the
right
of
the
commission
to
consider
the
adequacy
of
existing
service
in
the
field,
something
which
it
had
always
considered
up
until
that
time.
the
district
court
appears
to
have
held
and
--
and
i
must
confess
that
it's
not
perfectly
clear
whether
they
have
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
commission
may
not
give
any
consideration
to
this
factor
or
i
say
it
appears
to
upheld
the
commission
may
not
consider
the
adequacy
of
existing
services.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
i've
read
the
report
of
the
district
court
many,
many
times
and
i'm
still
not
clear
in
my
own
mind
whether
the
district
court
is
saying
flatly
that
the
commission
may
not
give
any
consideration,
or
whether
it
is
saying
that
the
manner
in
which
it
gave
consideration
here
was
error.
it
is
certainly
saying
the
latter,
but
some
of
the
language
in
the
report
that
for
example
considering
the
ability
and
willingness
of
existing
carriers
to
provide
the
service.
the
court
below
says,
“involves
the
application
of
a
sixth
test
specifically
rejected
by
congress.”
so
the
best
i
can
say
is
that
may
have
held
that
the
commission
may
not
give
any
consideration.
i
think
that's
the
position
of
the
united
states
too,
as
i
read
their
brief.
they
feel
the
court
may
have
held
that,
but
in
any
event,
the
other
appellees,
j-t
transport
and
the
contract
carrier
conference
pretty
flatly
contend
that
the
commission
may
not
consider
the
ability
and
willingness
of
existing
common
carriers
to
provide
the
service.
they
flatly
say
in
their
brief
in
more
than
one
place
that
such
a
factor
is
irrelevant
to
the
five
criteria.
so
that
--
in
fact,
one
or
the
other,
i
think
it's
the
j-t
brief
says
that,
“we
don't
think
the
court
went
so
far
to
say
it
may
not
give
any
consideration,
but
we
go
that
far.”
so
that
is
issue
is
here
one
way
or
another.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
largely
because
of
legislative
history,
your
honor.
now,
the
united
states
agrees
with
the
commission
that
the
commission
may
consider
such
a
showing,
indeed
that
it
must.
we
think
that
that's
patent
from
a
reading
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
i
think
it's
clear
that
a
showing
by
the
existing
carriers
of
their
ability
and
willingness
to
provide
a
service
which
would
meet
the
needs
of
the
supporting
shipper.
it's
necessary
to
be
considered
if
the
commission
is
going
to
imply
--
to
apply
the
third
and
fourth
criteria
at
all.
if
the
commission
is
going
to
consider
the
effect
which
granting
the
permit
will
have
upon
the
protesting
carrier,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
got
to
consider
whether
the
protesting
carrier
is
in
a
position
and
is
willing
to
provide
the
service
to
meet
the
shipper's
requirements.
and
it's
even
more
clear
i
believe
when
you
consider
the
fourth
criteria
as
the
commission
said
itself
in
its
report,
“whether
the
shippers
would
be
adversely
affected
by
a
denial
must
depend
upon
a
determination
of
whether
existing
service
is
adequate
to
meet
their
transportation
requirements.”
and
we
submit
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
need
on
the
part
of
the
supporting
shipper
for
the
proposed
service,
inherently
embraces
the
complementary
question
of
whether
the
existing
available
service
in
the
field
is
adequate
to
meet
the
shippers'
needs.
they
are
but
opposite
sides
of
the
same
coin.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
right
from
the
language
of
the
statute,
you've
got
to
consider
such
a
showing.
moreover,
the
1957
amendments
retain
the
same
governing
standard
of
consistency
with
the
public
interest
and
the
national
transportation
policy
that
had
applied
since
the
national
transportation
policy
was
enacted
in
1940
and
had
indeed
applied
since
the
motor
carrier
regulation
was
passed
in
1935
because
in
--
until
1940,
between
1935
and
1940,
the
standard
was
consistency
with
the
public
interest
and
section
202
(a)
of
the
motor
carrier
act
as
it
was
then
read
and
as
this
court
knows
202
(a)
was
the
predecessor
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
it
was
that
statement
of
policy
which
later
as
expanded
became
a
national
transportation
policy
so
that
this
governing
standard
has
always
existed
and
it
was
not
changed
by
the
1957
amendments
and
the
ability
of
carriers
in
the
field
has
always
been
considered
as
a
factor
of
considerable
importance
in
determining
whether
a
new
permit
or
certificate
should
be
issued
and
we
think
that
the
retention
of
the
standard
indicate
that
it
should
still
be
considered.
and
we
don't
think
that
it's
--
of
any
importance
that
the
factor
of
the
adequacy
of
existing
service
is
not
specifically
mentioned
in
the
statute.
appellees
apparently
would
feel
that
that
was
significant,
but
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
commission
has
considered
many
things
which
are
not
specifically
written
in
the
statute
and
the
good
example
is
this
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restriction
in
connection
with
common
carrier
certificates
and
contract
carrier
permits
issued
to
motor
carrier
subsidiaries
of
railroads.
and
the
commission
imports
this
standard
--
these
restrictions
which
originate
in
the
section
5
(2)
(b)
of
the
act
into
sections
207
and
209
dealing
with
motor
carrier
certificate
and
permits
and
that
practice
has
been
approved
and
indeed
required
by
the
court
in
the
number
of
cases,
most
recently
in
the
american
trucking
associations
case,
364
u.s.
in
fact,
in
that
american
trucking
associations'
case
at
pages
13
and
14,
and
we
have
sent
them
out
--
set
out
the
quote
in
our
brief
in
speaking
of
the
amended
section
209
(b),
this
court
clearly
recognized
that
the
ability
and
willingness
of
the
existing
carriers
to
render
the
service
was
of
a
significant
factor
the
commission
must
consider
and
point
it
out,
but
saying
at
one
point,
there
is
for
example
no
finding
that
independent
contract
carriers
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
perform
the
same
type
of
service
as
specific
motor.
so
we
think
its
clear
from
the
statute
the
history
and
from
even
this
court's
pattern
recognition
that
such
a
factor
and
such
of
showing
must
be
considered
by
the
commission.
that
leads
us
to
the
legislative
history.
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
united
states
and
the
commission
differ
on
the
manner
in
which
the
commission
treated
the
criterion
of
the
effect
of
granting
the
permit
on
the
protesting
--
existing
protesting
carriers.
the
commission
found
that
granting
the
permit
would
adversely
affect
the
existing
carriers
in
the
field
who
are
able
to
handle
the
traffic.
the
united
states
quarrels
with
the
commission
there
because
in
their
view,
the
commission
made
such
a
finding
on
the
basis
of
a
presumption
without
relating
it
to
specific
facts
of
harm
or
detriment
in
this
record
and
that
--
mr.
b.
franklin
taylor,
jr.
so
far
as
our
view
of
the
legislative
history
and
what
it
accomplished,
united
states
and
the
commission
is
generally
in
agreement.
so
far
as
the
ability
of
the
commission
to
consider
a
--
an
affirmative
showing
by
a
protestant
that
it's
able
and
willing
to
meet
the
shipper's
requirements,
we're
in
agreement.
and
so
far
as
the
manner
in
which
the
commission
treated,
the
affect
on
the
supporting
shipper
of
a
denial
of
the
contract
carrier
application,
the
united
states
agrees
with
the
commission
that
the
commission's
treatment
of
it
was
correct
and
that
the
district
court
erred
in
saying
(1)
that
we
had
imposed
an
unfair
burden
of
proof
on
the
applicant
and
its
shipper,
(2)
that
we
had
not
considered
the
distinct
needs
and
requirements
of
the
shipper
and
(3)
the
commission
had
not
made
adequate
findings
to
reflect
those
distinct
needs,
all
of
which
the
court
took
the
commission
to
task
for
it,
but
we
maintain
that
the
commission's
findings
were
adequate
and
that
the
united
states
agrees
with
us
on
that.
so
our
difference
is
quite
narrow.
the
appellees,
jt
and
the
contract
carriers'
conference
and
the
district
court
would
find
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1957
amendments,
a
clear
indication
on
the
--
or
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
prohibit
the
commission
from
considering
a
showing
by
common
carriers
that
they
can
and
will
provide
adequate
service.
and
of
course,
it's
--
i've
discussed
in
an
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
these
amendments
did
not
--
are
not
to
be
viewed
in
the
vacuum.
there
has
been
a
history
of
the
motor
carrier
regulation
as
this
court
has
pointed
out.
it
was
passed
for
distinct
purpose
to
stabilize
the
industry
to
take
care
of
unsatisfactory
economic
conditions
caused
by
overcrowding,
over
competition
and
unstable
great
picture.
we
also
point
out
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
that
one
of
the
purposes
and
the
fundamental
objective
of
motor
carrier
regulation
was
to
foster,
promote
and
protect
adequate
common
carrier
service
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
contract
carriers
were
placed
under
the
regulation,
that
that
was
a
purpose
of
the
motor
carrier
act
and
continues
to
be
a
purpose.
i
think
it's
supported
by
congress
in
the
same
session
at
which
passed
the
1957
amendments
in
dealing
with
amendments
to
--
another
part
of
the
act.
the
same
house
and
senate
committees
that
dealt
with
the
1957
amendments
we're
concerned
with
here,
said
at
one
point
in
its
report,
this
very
thing
that
a
purpose,
a
fundamental
purpose
of
motor
carrier
regulation
is
to
promote
and
protect
common
carrier
service.
so,
we
think
these
two
threats
must
be
considered
when
we
view
the
1957
amendments
themselves.
the
precise
impetus
for
the
1957
amendments
was
this
court's
decision
in
the
united
states,
the
contract
steel
carriers,
350
u.s.
at
page
409,
which
decision
apparent
to
make
possible
the
proliferation
of
contract
carrier
services
in
competition
with
common
carriers.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
contract
carriers
were
free
to
aggressively
search
for
a
new
business
and
enter
into
new
and
more
contracts
within
the
scope
of
their
permit.
the
result
was
that
the
line
between
common
and
contract
carrier
which
is
essentially
in
terms
of
holding
out,
the
common
carrier
holds
out
to
provide
its
services
to
the
general
public
or
anybody
that
can
use
it.
the
contract
carrier
has
no
such
holding
out
but
only
provides
a
service
to
the
shipper
with
whom
it
executes
a
contract.
and
by
a
contract
carrier
being
able
to
enter
into
many,
many
contracts,
it
was
reaching
the
point
where
it
was
essentially
holding
out
its
service
to
any
and
all
and
consequently,
the
line
between
common
and
contract
carrier
is
becoming
(inaudible).
