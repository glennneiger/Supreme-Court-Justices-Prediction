justice
felix
frankfurter
now
that
--
that
last
thing,
it
is
specifically
in
turn
dealt
with,
namely
the
bearing
of
granting
it
on
the
fate
of
the
common
carriers,
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
included
in
some
of
these
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
you've
just
said,
what
you
said
namely,
they
found
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
what
you
said
about
the
common
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
is
not
the
specifically
dealt
within
the
statute,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
was
a
much
more
precise
in
prospect,
namely,
the
statute
does
not
say
specifically
that
the
granting
or
denial
doesn't
use
specifically
the
bearing
upon
common
carrier's
ability
to
get
the
service,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
protesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
know
much
better
than
i,
there
is
a
history
behind
all
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i
just
wanted
to
nail
that
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
call
you
to
restate
your
third
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
as
a
general
proposition
or
with
reference
to
what
was
developed
in
the
record
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
cost
difference
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
cost
difference
--
is
there
a
difference
within
the
cost?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
boeing's
choice
of
j-t
instead
of
u.
s.
a.
c.,
finance,
money
play
no
part?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
the
--
the
boeing
was
free
of
course,
boeing
in
--
was
free
to
use
u.
s.
a.
c.
it
chose
not
to,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
reason
that
you
gave?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
upshot
of
--
of
the
commission's
denial
of
this
certificate
to
j-t
or
equipment
to
j-t
that
boeing
would
have
to
use
u.
s.
a.
c.?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
implying
the
--
the
legal
consequences
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
significance.
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
means.
it
means
that
--
that
the
carrier
of
choice
would
be
restricted
to
what
boeing
is
concerned,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
the
commission's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
large
--
at
large,
the
commission's
position
is
taking
into
account
the
relative
encouragement
or
help
or
regard
to
the
had
for
the
railroad
to
grant
transportation
systems
in
their
entirety,
it
has
the
right
to
make
such
--
such
determinations
which
would
restrict
the
shippers'
freedom,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
goes
back
to
what
we've
had
to
deal
in
settled
cases
namely
with
this
--
the
national
transportation
policy,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
amendment
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
under
the
1957
amendment,
it
wasn't
able
to
do
this
under
the
prior
--
well,
1957
enlarged
the
power
of
the
commission
instead
of
narrowing
them
widely
speaking,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
makes
you
say
that
the
decision
isn't
--
may
not
give
any
consideration
because
if
it
may
give
some
consideration,
then
the
weight
to
be
given,
(inaudible)
questions
of
judicial
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
largely
because
of
legislative
history
i
suppose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
taylor,
before
you
begin
so
i
shouldn't
be
breaking
in
on
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
practice
or
the
orders
of
the
commission,
or
whatever
the
basis
for
your
statement,
that
it
has
been
said
in
the
law
prior
the
1957
amendment,
taking
into
account
what
the
district
court
here
said
couldn't
be
taken
into
account?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
this
is
about,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
am
i
right
to
infer
that
if
this
decision
stands,
there
would
be
a
break
in
that
practice
or
a
denial
of
something
that
has
been
enforced
by
the
commission
from
1935
to
1957?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
not
(voice
overlap)
and
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
the
material
showed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
certainly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now
the
government
doesn't
stand
on
that,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
assume
--
assume
the
decision
below
is
not
to
be
read
to
the
extreme
extent,
to
which
some
of
the
appellees
at
all
had
been
would
put
it,
assume
that
they
say
that
on
the
record
here
while
it
may
take
into
account
what
happens
to
the
common
carriers
addressed
on
that
almost
exclusively
or
with
insufficient
basis
either
in
facts
or
in
finding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
that
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
there
was
a
--
whether
--
what
was
decided
in
this
case,
forget
the
talk,
what
was
decided
in
your
view,
the
commission's
view
is
the
departure
from
what
had
been
the
commission's
practice
under
to
the
motor
carrier
act
for
20
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
are
here
not
reviewing
their
brief,
but
the
decision
below.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
i
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
i
have
read
the
opinion
as
wholly,
not
that
the
commission
is
precluded,
but
that
in
this
case
on
the
record,
the
evidence
before
the
commission
and
the
requisite
findings
to
be
made
thereon.
one,
there
was
an
insufficient,
that
there
was
a
want
of
evidence,
or
two,
or
and
two,
that
there
weren't
findings
such
as
a
court
is
entitled
to
have
from
the
commission
in
order
to
know
what
it
is
that
it
is
reviewing,
suppose
i
--
we'll
get
the
--
the
opinion
below
that
way
and
therefore,
the
decision
to
carry
out
that
kind
of
an
opinion,
what
do
you
say
then
about
the
decision
below?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
right,
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest,
instead
of
worrying
about
what
the
united
states
argued
and
what
the
appellees,
the
other
appellees
argued,
and
bothering
about
my
questions,
you
address
yourself
to
what
is
involved
in
justice
harlan's
question
what
you
had
said
before
you
intervene,
namely
that
taking
not
the
extreme
interpretation
that
may
be
placed
upon
the
district
court,
but
taking
the
view
that
it
does
not
disallow
the
commission
from
taking
into
account
the
effect
or
consequence
to
the
uncommon
carriers,
(a)
there
is
basis
in
the
record
for
the
fact
--
for
the
conclusion
that
it
did
not
unduly
give
weight
to
that
factor,
and
(b),
that
there
are
findings
carrying
out
that
sufficiency
of
evidence.
i
think
then,
one
will
be
a
little
clearer
rather
than
having
to
consider
all
of
these
cross
kinds
of
differences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
if
it's
merely
a
question
of
whether
it
is
--
where
it
would
be
rendering
the
same
service
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
shipper,
considerations
of
convenience,
time,
cost,
everything
--
you
say
cost
is
out
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
all
of
the
other
considerations
had
make
a
difference
to
the
shipper,
it
says
a
contest
on
the
ingredient
of
factors
that
add
up
to
satisfy
or
meeting
the
shippers'
need,
if
there's
a
difference
of
opinion
and
there's
a
basis
for
taking
one
view
rather
than
another,
it's
not
a
business
of
a
court
to
say,
“we
think
we
disagree
with
the
commission.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know.
but
that's
a
loose
phrase
“a
finding
of
fact”
and
i'm
trying
to
penetrate
in
finding
out
what
--
what
is
the
finding
of
fact
in
the
sense
that
if
there
is
a
conflict,
the
commission's
resolution
of
the
conflict
is
determinative,
rather
than
what
are
the
standards
by
which
the
so-called
fact
to
judge.
those
are
two
very
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
we
better
agree
on
what
are
the
standards
that
may
be
taken
into
account
once
you
assume
the
common
carriers'
interest
as
viewed
from
the
shipper's
need
is
a
relevant
factor
for
the
ultimate
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
go
beyond
the
immediate
discussion,
let
me
rather
conclude,
forgive
me.
209
(b)
sets
forth
five
factors
in
determining
whether
he
can
affirm
and
be
consistent
to
the
public
interest
et
cetera,
the
commission
shall
consider
the
five
factors,
which
you
enumerated
just
--
i
want
to
know
this.
i
want
to
know
the
commission's
specific
attitude
on
this
question.
must
the
commission
take
all
five
factors
into
account?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
knew
you
must
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
must
in
determining
whether
a
delicate
issue
canvassed
those
five
considerations.
i'm
not
now
asking
whether
the
considerations
have
any
relevance
in
a
particular
case,
and
therefore,
they
do
take
them
into
account,
namely
zero.
i'm
not
asking
the
weight
to
be
attached,
i'm
asking,
must
they
in
their
conclusion
give
evidence
that
they
have
considered
the
five
ingredients
which
determines
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
rejection
or
grant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
my
question.
i
answer
those
--
i
put
a
very
specific
question
with
very
specific
purposes
in
mind,
with
very
specific
decisions
of
this
court
in
mind.
namely,
when
any
administrative
agency,
whether
the
commission
or
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
the
sugar
case
we
had,
is
told
to
act
on
the
basis
of
the
following
consideration,
he
cannot
delete
from
the
statutorily
enumerated
consideration
anyone
and
say,
“well,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
going
to
pay
attention
to
this.”
he
may
find
that
there's
no
part
in
the
equation.
it
has
no
weight.
it
has
no
value.
it
has
the
irrelevance.
but
there
must
be
some
evidence
that
the
commission
wasn't
unmindful
of
the
limitation
of
its
mandate.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
can
you
--
can
this
--
the
report
of
the
commission,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
commission
arguing
before
this
court,
that
the
report
of
the
commission
indicate
explicitly
that
it
did
something
about
each
one
of
those
five?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
commission
doesn't
have
to
take
your
--
the
commission
doesn't
have
to
determine
the
demand
for
a
permit,
either
by
your
willingness
to
do,
that
it
isn't
foreclosed
to
say,
despite
that
fact,
we
think
some
of
these
other
factors
outweigh
any
more
than
it
has
to
give
the
shipper
a
free
choice,
neither
the
shippers'
wish
nor
the
common
carriers'
readiness
and
determinative
as
i
read
the
statute
and
as
i
read
its
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
quite
--
unless
you
have
a
different
legislative
history
in
mind
than
i
have,
what
the
commission
tried
to
originally
propose
is
that
that
such
--
such
a
permit
can
be
granted
only
if
the
existing
common
carriers
are
unwilling
or
unable
to
provide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
burden
of
proof.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
solomon,
please
tell
me
why
the
commission
--
why
the
commission,
having
been
authorized
to
take
into
account
five
factors
cannot
say
as
a
result
of
a
great
deal
of
experience
over
more
than
two
decades,
our
experience
lead
us
to
conclude
that
in
evaluating
these
five
factors,
it
seems
to
us
desirable
from
a
point
of
view
or
proof
to
start
off
in
saying
that
in
most
instances,
the
factors
have
been
shown
to
be
such
that
we
can
now
formulate
a
general
rule
that
on
the
hold,
this
one
(inaudible)
the
burden
of
proof.
so
long
as
they
don't
make
it
conclusive,
please
tell
me
why
that
may
not
be
drawn
from
their
experience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
putting
that
completely,
that
means
that
they
cannot
make
their
generalization
or
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
can
draw
on
a
generalization
as
one
of
the
elements
in
reaching
a
conclusion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you,
but
a
great
deal
of
leeway
will
be
given
as
to
the
different
weight
they
attach
and
i'm
rather
surprised
that
--
surprised
to
look
at
the
brief,
neither
side
have
cited
a
case
in
which
we
dealt
with
this
problem
rather
extensively,
namely
secretary
of
agriculture
against
central
roig
company
in
338
u.s.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
case
dealt
with
a
similar
problem
relating
to
the
functions
of
secretary
of
agriculture
and
gave
him
the
broadest
leeway
as
to
how
you
weigh
the
different
factors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
have
a
separate
statutory
standing
or
duty
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
an
independent
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
distinctive
needs
within
the
statute,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
on
209,
is
there
any
difference
between
needs
and
distinctive
need?
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
tell
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
they
must
evaluate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
209,
there
is
no
“distinctive
needs.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
automobile
shipper
had
different
needs
than
a
banana
shipper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
from
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
from
my
point
of
view,
it
isn't
reasonably
adequate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
“words.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
"words,
words,
words,”
then,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
do
mean
with
--
because
the
statute
talks
not
about
an
abstract
platonic
shipper,
it
means
a
fellow
is
engaged
in
business
as
some
goods
to
ship
from
a
to
b
and
his
needs
must
be
satisfied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
many
of
the
carriers
who
ships
bulk
goods,
that
isn't
good
enough
that
the
particular
bulk
requires
a
particular
treatment,
a
particular
acceptance
and
a
particular
delivery.
justice
felix
frankfurter
once
you
spell
it
out,
i
don't
disagree
with
you
at
all,
but
i
don't
get
any
(inaudible)
significance
between
specific
needs
and
needs.
needs
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
don't
satisfy
the
particular
shipper
on
satisfaction
of
his
needs.
it's
as
simple
as
that
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know,
they
have
loosened
their
language
unlike
what
courts
there
were
engaging.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
if
you
can
penetrate
that
in
their
result,
they
have
left
out
irrelevant
factors
and
i
understand
you
thoroughly,
if
you'd
go
and
looked
at
their
words
through
a
microscope,
then
i
don't
think
why
--
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
they
should
be
judged
more
harshly
than
you
would
judge
me,
i
hope.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
evidence
--
what
--
your
proceedings
are
before
the
commission
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
oral
testimony
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
extensive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
all
the
witnesses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
nothing
in
the
oral
testimony
bearing
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
this
is
the
record
--
if
this
is
the
record,
then
you
know
the
record,
was
there
anything?
why
do
you
have
to
refer
to
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
they
repeat
in
their
order,
in
their
report,
the
evidence
that's
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
be
--
i
don't
follow.
if
in
fact,
the
issue
was
canvassed.
i
can
understand
if
you
say
the
issue
wasn't
canvassed,
but
if
the
issue
was
canvassed
testimonially
before
the
commission,
must
they
summarize
the
evidence?
again
and
again,
courts
don't
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
evaluate
it
by
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
go
on
to
the
next
sentence.
maybe
they
were
--
they
were
repeating
however
than
indeed
(inaudible)
could
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
generally,
but
that's
why
i
asked
you
whether
there's
an
underlying
basis
for
it
in
the
testimony.
if
you
say,
“no,”
that
would
be
an
end
of
the
matter.
but
you
don't
say,
“no,”
you
said
there
was
some.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you?
must
they
repeat
it
in
the
body
of
their
report?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
think
you
must
be
in
that
position,
if
you
say
they
didn't
adequately,
take
into
account
a
requirement
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
--
if
you
can
look
at
the
examination,
direct
and
cross-examination,
wasn't
it,
on
these
points?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
ask
you
whether
very
much.
there
were
some.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
say
it's
barring
your
testimony,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
standards
for
issuing
contract
carriers
as
against
common
carriers
certificate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
209
isn't
that,
209
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
gets
the
relationship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
1957
act
was
an
enlargement
of
opportunities
to
what
you
call
a
little
carrier,
that
contract
carrier.
it
was
a
contraction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
origin
of
the
statute
was
precisely
to
cut
down
the
freedom
that
theretofore
existed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
were
in,
in
the
original
proposal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
some
an
--
another
one
in
there,
which
would
have
been
more
restrictive.
but
the
commission
was
--
didn't
ask
for
a
free
charter
to
deny
a
grant
without
more,
were
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
burden,
it
would
have
been
an
absolute
prohibitory
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
solomon,
if
--
your
answer
to
justice
whittaker's
question
in
the
position
of
the
government,
the
case
is
a
very
simple
one,
namely,
that
congress
has
laid
down
five
requirements
to
be
considered
by
the
commission
and
as
i
understand
the
question
to
which
you
responded,
your
answer
means
the
commission
disregarded
four
out
of
the
five
and
paid
attention
only
to
one.
is
that
the
position
of
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
if
that
is
what
--
that
is
what
justice
whittaker
read
from
the
judge
below.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
but
the
portion
of
what
he
just
read
from
judge
smith's
opinion
says
that
that,
the
commission
paid
exclusive
attention,
getting
the
exact
words,
to
one
factor,
not
in
fact
so
that
we
do
not
have
to
have
pre-arguments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know,
but
hedging
means
that
it
isn't
so,
or
hedging
means
nothing.
what
do
you
mean
you
hedged?
you
mean
you
didn't
agree
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
am
trying
to
understand
this
case
and
if
judge
smith
is
right,
it
is
a
very
simple
matter,
namely,
the
commission
is
on
the
duty
to
consider
five
factors
in
reaching
the
conclusion.
it
considered
only
one
and
therefore,
there
is
no
need
of
long
arguments
or
long
opinions
or
long
anything.
it
disregarded
an
act
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
i
know
what
he
meant
unless
by
what
he
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
generously
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
generously
suggesting
you'll
clear
up
all
the
difficulties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
make
those
fixtures
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
that
all
these
details
were
developed
before
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
(inaudible)
were
all
written?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
refresh
my
recollection,
did
the
district
court
sustain
you
in
saying
that
there
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
protestants
could
perform
this
very
service
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
bringing
to
be
facilities
to
give
the
service
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
word
“dedicate”
is
any
kind
of
final
label
that
gets
(inaudible).
the
district
court
say,
there
was
no
theory
that
the
protestant
common
carriers
could
furnish,
willing,
and
able
to
furnish
the
very
service
which
the
shippers
needed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
because
that
they
couldn't
furnish
the
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
could
put
themselves
in
the
situation
to
give
the
service
that
boeing
needed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
whole
commission
on
the
reconsideration,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree,
i
remember
what
he
said
but
it
was
before
the
commission
as
an
entirety.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it
was
before
division
1.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
didn't
sit,
commissioner
macpherson
dissented,
commissioner
webb
concurred,
commissioner
freas
concurred
and
result
commissioner
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
eight
--
three
didn't
participate,
so
i
suppose
there
were
eight
left,
aren't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
seven.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
is
a
difference
between
saying
the
court
rule
because
there
was
a
lack
of
evidence
and
saying
thereby
the
wrong
standards,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
--
what
does
the
court
decide
in
your
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wrape,
if
you
are
right
that
the
protesting
carrier
couldn't
have
furnished,
didn't
make
either
case
showing
his
ability
to
furnish
the
service
that
boeing
needs,
then
we
don't
get
to
the
question
of
standards
at
all,
do
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
--
that
the
protestants
could
do
what
the
contract
carrier
did
in
what
they
needed,
if
that
is
so,
it
doesn't
answer
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
therefore,
if
they
don't
meet
the
distinct
needs,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
repeating
the
first
question
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
was
not
involved
in
the
other
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
yes.
i
thought
you
said
there
are
two
additional
problems
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
interrupt
mr.
ginnane?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
read
that
statement
about
the
common
--
protesting
carriers
perform
this
kind
of
service,
would
you
mind
reading
that
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
seeking
all
the
irrelevant
factors
into
account
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
geography,
the
same
states,
et
cetera?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
there
are
common
carriers
in
new
england
who
do
this
as
against
common
carriers
in
the
south.
i
don't
know
if
there's
a
difference
or
not,
but
i
think
those
were
take
into
account.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
like
it
because
interline
--
because
shipping
from
one
carrier
to
another
involves
delay
uncertainty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
was
the
volume
of
the
commission,
from
what
you
have
read,
the
commission
said
that
these
were
generalized.
now,
what
specifically
was
the
evidence
that
the
commission
rejected
on
the
part
of
the
shippers
that
this
really
isn't
meeting
their
needs?
i
don't
mean
that
its
perfection,
nothing
as
perfect
as
well
i
suppose.
but
this
isn't
meeting
their
needs
and
the
common
can't
play
in
which
one
would
use
that
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
district
court
you
say
went
on
the
ground
that
the
record
clearly
established.
that
means
that
there
wasn't
room
for
a
contrary
judgment
by
the
commission
that
straight
line
shipment,
straight
line
transportation
is
advantageous.
now,
the
question
is
that
it's
sufficiently
advantageous
as
to
make
--
if
you
please
the
qualitative
difference,
i
should
think
that's
important,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
you
said
a
minute
ago
yourself
that
no
doubt
that
straight
line
transportation
is
preferable.
now,
how
heavily
preferable?
to
what
extent
preferable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
exactly
this
issue
canvassed
dealt
with
to
a
testimony
and
for
experienced
over
a
period
of
month
if
not
in
a
year,
et
cetera,
et
cetera?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
if
we
take
into
account
anything
that
promotes
private
carriage
is
to
be
discouraged?
is
that
also
national
transportation
policy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
common
carriers
meet
that
requirement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
need
to
go
in
your
general
knowledge
mr.
ginnane.
i
mean,
is
this
canvassed
in
this
–
i
thought
we
are
reviewing
a
proceeding
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
refer
to
page
198
and
i
looked
at
it,
anyhow,
it's
on
steele,
this
past
month,
when
that
merchandize
of
interline
especially
get
shifted
from
one
carrier
to
another.
we
have
one
awful
time
getting
their
merchandize
at
large.
this
past
month,
we
--
i've
had
complaint,
we
had
one
customer
(inaudible)
ship
is
ordering
a
full
load,
shipped
it
in
our
trucks
so
it
wouldn't
be
necessary.
but
i
should
think
withheld
in
the
universal
camera
case
that
the
commission,
therefore
it
was
your
commission,
administrative
agency
must
not
disregard
the
examiner's
finding.
it
must
consider
it
as
part
of
the
whole
record
but
it
may
--
or
different
conclusions
from
what
he
has
before
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginnane,
do
you
think
--
can
you
give
me
any
hope
that
i
might
live
long
enough
so
that
the
commission
would
make
(inaudible)
on
findings
so
that
(inaudible)
have
to
go
through
looking
for
the
(inaudible)
i
just
asked
you
if
you
could
give
any
hope
along
that
line.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
be
contended
that
congress
meant
almost
the
opposite
that
it
didn't
say
that
a
permit
must
be
granted
to
a
contract
carrier
whenever
it
would
be
to
the
advantage
of
a
shipper
to
use
the
contract
carrier.
that
is
not
the
legislation,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
if
in
an
application
proceeding,
the
shipper
must
submit
to
a
denial
of
the
application
and
take
on
the
common
carrier
and
then
bring
a
proceeding
and
say
the
common
carrier
to
which
you
have
preferably
--
which
i
must
now
use
unless
i
become
a
private
carrier,
as
to
why
unreasonable
rates
and
they
have
to
begin
rate
--
unreasonable
rate
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
would
--
that
he
would
--
a
shipper
would
support
this
application
but
the
commission
says,
“no
you
can't
have
this
more
favorable
mode
of
transportation,
this
contract
carrier.
you
have
to
resort
to
a
common
carrier”
and
then
he
must
bring
a
proceeding
and
pay
the
rates
to
which
i'm
subjected
because
i
must
use
the
common
carrier
if
i
don't
want
to
go
into
the
private
carriage
business
too
high
and
that
will
bring
a
regular
rate
proceeding
to
lower
the
rate,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
if
the
rates
are
onerous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
he
must
file
--
he
loses,
the
shipper
loses
in
the
application
proceeding
to
get
a
more
favorable
private
contract
carrier
as
a
mode
of
transportation.
he
loses
in
that,
and
must
therefore
either
do
his
own
carriage
or
take
the
common
carrier
who
has
or
which
has
onerous
unreasonable
rates,
he
must
begin
all
over
again
in
a
rate
proceeding,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
assuming
he
lost
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
it's
established.
is
it
established
that
the
contract
carrier
rate
would
be
cheaper?
is
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
accept
that
or
do
you
reject
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
we're
talking
about
a
hypothetical
case,
are
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
case
before
us,
isn't
the
case
where
concededly
the
contract
carrier's
rate
would
be
less
than
the
common
carrier's
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean
cannot
be
ignored
by
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
--
yes
you
were,
but
i
don't
quite
get
its
pertinence
to
this
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
the
essential
thing
is
that
considering
the
nature
of
the
problem
and
the
structure
of
the
act,
rate
problems
was
not
to
be
dealt
with
in
certification
proceedings
or
other
proceedings
had
nothing
intrinsically
to
do
with
rates.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
specifically
in
this
case,
the
commission
while
denying
this
grant
has
given
a
temporary
certificate,
hasn't
it?
it
was
a
temporary
certificate,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
the
commission
may
say,
taking
into
account
the
five
ingredients
of
209
nevertheless,
there
is
raise
of
questions
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate
of
these
common
carriers
which
has
been
disclosed
in
these
proceedings,
we
will
continue
this
temporary
certificate
and
revert
the
question
of
the
rate
structure
of
the
common
carrier
to
a
separate
rate
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solomon,
what
is
the
legal
significance
of
a
threat
of
going
back
to
private
carriage?
justice
felix
frankfurter
going
through
it
if
not
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
what?
i
want
to
know
and
so
what,
you
said
particularly
if
as
the
record
shows
in
this
case,
this
could
be
in
the
belief
they
go
back
--
they
back
go
back
to
private
carriage.
suppose
they
do,
what
other
--
why
is
that
--
i
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
don't
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
what
is
the
legal
relevance
of
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
is
that
genuinely
(inaudible)
to
say
they
won't
be
hurt.
there
maybe
a
difference
between
having
a
contract
carrier
as
a
competitor
and
having
boeing
and
swift
and
schaffer
and
well
who
not
do
their
own
trucking.
i
don't
think
those
are
equations.
contract
carriers
are
in
business
for
money
and
a
fellow
who
carries
his
own
stuff,
a
private
carrier
isn't
in
business
for
trucking,
he
is
in
his
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
all
speculated.
we
have
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
about
the
money.
isn't
it
about
the
money?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
in
what
part
is
this
money?
this
is
a
question
of
drawing
upon
the
available
transportation
resources,
revenues
of
the
country
is
that
this
is
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
is
about
additional
things
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
united
states
and
the
government,
but
as
between
the
protesting
carrier
and
the
private
--
and
the
common
carrier,
its
money.
justice

alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
this
in
an
invidious
sense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
rate,
the
rate
--
question
of
the
rate
problem,
with
the
rate
claim
may
evaporate
after
the
application
proceeding
is
finished.
justice
felix
frankfurter
rate
proceedings
evaporate
very
often.
these
are
counted
in
the
game.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
this
court
rejects
an
argument,
it
doesn't
mean
it
hasn't
considered
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
it
simply
says
that
that
is
an
insufficient
answer.
that's
all
they
said
and
the
question
that
justice
stewart
put
is
an
inflicted
argument.
the
answer
is
implicit
that
means
this
alone
is
isn't
because
there
are
other
considerations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
solomon,
when
the
congress
dealt
with
the
contract
carrier,
it
wasn't
indulging
in
permission.
it
was
restricting
the
area
of
freedom.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
always
more
restrictions
in
common
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
that
there
was
a
congressional
act
permitted
with
them.
i
say
there
were
always
restrictions
on
common
carriers
and
there
were
no
restrictions
on
contract
carriers,
and
congress
by
1935
wasn't
giving
permission
for
largest
contract
carriers.
it
was
imposing
very
severe
restrictions,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
anyhow,
they
had
--
they
had
freedom
in
law
both
under
the
state
and
federal
law
which
thereafter
did
not
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
they
were
concerned
with
the
decision
of
the
revenues
to
be
obtained
from
commercial
trucking.
and
the
senate
report
emphasizes
that
their
chief
concern
was
with
protecting
common
carriage
because
then
it
is
a
matter
of
reporting
to
the
committee
they
had
emphasis
on
that
fact
and
he
said
that
the
public
interest
--
your
committee
is
of
the
opinion
of
public
interest
and
a
sound
transportation
system
and
particularly
in
a
stable
and
adequate
system
of
common
carriage
require
this
bill.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
why
he
said
it.
all
i
--
i
don't
go
behind
documents
particularly
of
a
senate
committee
that
reports
a
bill
which
have
these
provisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
any
private
information.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact,
he
said
it
in
words
for
the
committee
that
they
were
concerned
to
protect,
and
to
share
that
the
common
carriage
was
to
have
if
there
was
to
be
any
commercial
transportation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
find
that
one
word
of
reference
and
even
the
committee
reports
or
the
statute
to
the
part
that
private
carriage
is
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
private
interest
properly
present
their
private
view,
their
particular
private
interest
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
every
private
interest
represented
before
a
committee
requires
me
to
assume
that
that
was
right
into
the
committee
report
or
into
a
statute
when
it
doesn't
appear
there.
