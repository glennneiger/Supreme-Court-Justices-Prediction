where
is
the
united
states
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
as
far
as
your
present
argument
has
gone,
you
are
in
agreement,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
--
as
i
read
your
brief,
i
understood
your
ultimate
point
would
be
that
however
you'll
read
the
district
court's
opinion,
that
what
the
district
court
did
here
exceeded
its
proper
function
as
the
reviewing
court
of
the
administrative
agency.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
the
findings
that
it
--
so
far
as
findings
were
concerned,
you
say
the
findings
are
adequate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
you
pinpoint
the
particular
passages
in
the
report?
if
you
can
do
it
quickly.
justice
john
m.
harlan
47?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
statute
eventually
enacted
--
enacted
over
the
protest
to
the
commission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
arguing
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean,
that's
where
all
this
is
directed
to.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question,
but,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
too
much.did
the
commission
exclude
the
evidence
that
you
thought
was
relevant
to
the
issues
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
got
before
the
commission
everything
that
you
thought
was
germane.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
say
they
don't
--
you
say
they
stop
and
didn't
consider
4
as
well
as
3?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
it's
just
one
side
of
the
coin,
isn't
it?
