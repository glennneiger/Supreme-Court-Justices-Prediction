mr.
roland
rice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
roland
rice
let
me
say
that
it
is
the
view
of
the
specialty
common
carrier,
which
i
represent
in
the
two
groups
of
common
carriers
holding
general
commodities,
which
i
represent
that
the
commission
is
required
to
consider
all
of
the
elements
enumerated
by
congress
in
section
209
(b).
let
me
also
emphasize
that
this
specialty
common
carrier
which
i
represent
hauled
a
limited
group
of
commodities,
namely
u.s.a.c.
transport
company.
these
are
commodities,
airplane
parts,
engines
and
so
on,
and
we
are
obligated
to
offer
our
services
to
all
people
who
ship
and
who
wished
to
receive
those
commodities.
now,
with
respect
to
the
general
commodity
carriers
which
i
represent,
the
two
groups,
the
two
conferences
of
american
trucking
associations,
we
hold
out
our
services
to
all
the
public
insofar
as
we
are
capable
of
doing
so
and
in
many,
many
cases,
we
are
actually
serving
thousands
and
thousands
of
shippers
and
we
haul
many
thousands
of
individual
commodities.
now,
at
the
same
time,
there
are
common
carriers
that
transport
a
very
few
commodities
and
u.s.a.c.
transport
is
one
of
those.
j-t
transport,
a
contract
carrier
also
hauls
a
very
few
commodities,
certainly
as
compared
with
the
general
commodity
carriers.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
those
two
are
competitive
because
j-t
is
now
seeking
and
has
been
granted
temporary
authority
by
this
commission
to
do
something,
which
very
clearly,
u.s.a.c.
transport
has
the
right
to
do
and
the
commission
found
that
u.s.a.c.
transport
could
perform
this
service.
not
only
that,
there
are
automobile
carriers
who
handled
nothing
but
automobiles
and
who
are
common
carriers
and
who
served
whatever
portion
of
the
public
is
available
to
them
and
there
aren't
many
automobile
manufacturers
in
this
country.
at
the
same
time,
there
are
contract
carriers
of
automobiles
holding
permits
granted
by
this
commission,
which
perform
service
which
is
almost
identical,
if
not
physically
identical,
with
that
served
by
the
common
carriers.
in
addition,
there
are
many
other
types
of
common
carriers
of
--
specialty
commodities.
for
example,
you
have
the
household
goods
carriers
who
haul
for
anybody
but
they
don't
haul
general
commodities.
they
haul
that
group
of
commodities
falling
in
the
area
of
the
household
goods
service.
you
should
find
the
same
thing
with
tank
truck
carriers.
you
have
common
carriers
by
tank
truck
and
you
have
contract
carriers
by
tank
trunk
and
they
will
be
both
be
hauling
the
same
or
a
limited
number
of
commodities,
and
these
carriers
therefore,
in
a
very
real
sense
are
competitive
the
one
with
the
other.
the
question
was
asked
here
a
bit
earlier,
whether
or
not
if
what
the
lower
court
does
should
become
law,
there
will
have
been
established
a
sharp
departure
from
practice
in
the
past
with
respect
to
what
this
commission
has
done
in
considering
cases
when
a
new
application
is
before
it.
it's
my
view
and
very
emphatically
so
that
this
would
amount
to
a
sharp
departure
in
practice,
going
all
the
way
back
to
the
beginning
of
regulation
in
1935
and
continuing
to
cases
that
are
being
decided
week
after
week
and
month
after
month
by
this
commission
in
which
it
shows
that
it
does
consider
the
adequacy
of
service
of
existing
carriers.
that
is
something
which
in
my
opinion
is
specifically
brought
out
by
the
amendments
of
--
in
209
(b)
in
1957,
and
furthermore,
that
language,
the
word
“adequate”
itself
appears
in
the
national
transportation
policy,
the
concluding
sentence
of
which
imposes
upon
the
commission
the
obligation
to
administer
all
the
sections
of
act
with
due
regard
to
the
total
policy
expressed
by
congress
there,
which
includes
adequacy
and
which
includes
sound
economic
conditions.
we
think
the
commission
was
fully
within
its
rights
and
bound
by
law
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
give
consideration
to
every
element
that
it
did
and
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
reached
in
this
case.
and
furthermore,
if
anyone
wants
to
know
what
adverse
effect
there
might
be
upon
u.s.a.c.
transport,
the
common
carrier
of
limited
commodities,
which
i
here
represent
along
with
the
others,
let
me
say,
just
look
at
the
219
empty
vehicles
which
we
moved
in
a
two
and
half
month
period,
and
this
in
the
record
from
indianapolis
out
and
on
which
we
had
no
break
and
with
which
by
modification
which
we
offer
to
do
have
record,
we
could
have
used,
for
transporting
the
commodities,
that
are
here
before
the
commission
and
before
this
court.
mr.
roland
rice
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
this
court
said
so
in
364
u.s.1,
the
pacific
motor
trucking
case.
thank
you.
mr.
roland
rice
i
hope
to
have
some
time,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
roland
rice
we're
coming
right
to
the
question
of
lower
rates
and
i
also
want
to
deal
with
the
other
question,
which
has
just
been
discussed.
it
is
said
by
the
court
below
your
honors
that
the
commission
erred
in
not
giving
consideration
to
rate
advantages
and
that
this
ought
to
have
been
done
and
that
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
below
believes
that
this
alone
should
have
been
determined
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
rates
ought
not
to
be
considered
in
these
application
cases.
i
think
the
real
reason
for
that
is
not
so
much
that
rates
would
then
involve
cost
--
studies
of
costs
which
are
extremely
lengthy
and
expensive
and
time
consuming.
it
isn't
that
alone
though
that
would
be
very
hurtful
and
delaying
in
these
proceedings.
furthermore,
to
do
it
at
this
stage,
it
would
probably
mean
that
all
the
protesting
carriers
would
have
to
bring
in
studies
of
their
rates
and
cost
studies
which
would
further
delay
and
complicate
the
matter.
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
a
better
reason
for
refusing
to
consider
rate
levels
in
the
application
proceedings
is
that
the
sole
legal
question
before
the
regulatory
agency
at
that
time
is
a
question
of
the
service
need,
is
there
a
need
for
service?
not
what
the
service
is
where
but
whether
or
not
a
need
exists
and
to
pass
upon
the
various
considerations
which
go
to
make
up
that
need
and
to
arrive
at
an
administrative
determination
upon
those
facts
as
to
a
need.
the
commission
has
very
properly
said
that
if
there
is
a
question
concerning
the
level
of
the
rates
that
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
act
--
the
provisions
that
we
call
the
rate
provisions
that
are
available
to
the
parties
for
filing
complaints
and
sometimes
they
are
petitions
for
investigations
and
so
on,
whereby
the
level
of
the
rate
maybe
brought
before
the
commission
in
a
proper
proceeding
calculated
to
consider
that
issue
and
not
the
issue
of
a
need
for
additional
service
or
new
service
or
advancing
or
extending
service.
mr.
roland
rice
in
an
application
proceeding?
no
sir,
i
do
not
say
that
they
can
never
be
considered.
mr.
roland
rice
that
might
be
but
we
do
not
have
that
here,
your
honor.
and
furthermore,
i
think
in
the
schaffer
case,
this
court
had
such
a
matter
before
it
or
so
indicated
and
furthermore,
the
commission
has
recognized
that
if
the
level
of
the
rate
is
such
as
to
constitute
effectively
and
embargo,
perhaps
rates
ought
to
be
considered
then
but
we
don't
have
that
before
us
at
this
time.
mr.
roland
rice
if
i
understand
your
question,
you're
assuming
that
he
would
two
things
that
he
would
support
an
application
for
new
rights
and
also
would
file
a
complaint.
mr.
roland
rice
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
he
should
go
through
both
of
those,
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
roland
rice
well,
he
wouldn't'
have
to
try
first
of
those.
if
the
rates
are
onerous
and
he
doesn't
like
them,
he
can
file
the
complaint
against
the
rates
but
it's
not
--
mr.
roland
rice
you
said
if
he
loses.
mr.
roland
rice
yes,
yes,
that
would
be
the
procedure
to
be
followed.
but
of
course,
you've
got
this
fact
in
this
particular
case,
that
they
had
not
used
this
common
carrier
as
a
great
deal
and
there's
no
evidence
here
at
all
that
they
had
made
any
complaint
about
the
rates
and
no
evidence
--
mr.
roland
rice
not
established.
mr.
roland
rice
not
established.
mr.
roland
rice
i
reject
that
personally.
mr.
roland
rice
in
the
question
you
put,
that's
my
understanding,
yes.
mr.
roland
rice
only
in
a
few
instances,
and
that's
all
that
it
says
your
honor.
mr.
roland
rice
no,
i'm
accepting
that
fact,
and
the
commission
so
found.
the
commission
after
looking
at
all
of
this
evidence
came
to
the
conclusion
that
all
the
--
all
the
facts
considered,
all
the
elements
of
the
law
that
the
commission
had
to
look
at,
that
the
one
important
complaint
these
shippers
had
related
to
the
level
of
the
rates.
mr.
roland
rice
at
395
of
the
record
as
i
recall
it,
your
honor.
mr.
roland
rice
suppose
that
was
--
mr.
roland
rice
i
don't
think
that
that
would
have
any
influence,
but
the
only
case
that
i
know
anything
about
in
which
that
has
occurred
is
in
the
schaffer
case
where
you
had
two
modes
of
transportation,
and
this
court
took
a
look
at
the
modes
of
transportation
and
found
that
an
inherent
advantage
in
one
mode
lay
in
its
ability
to
provide
better
service
and
at
lower
rates.
mr.
roland
rice
that's
right,
and
they
had
used
--
mr.
roland
rice
no,
and
it
just
doesn't
operate
that
way.
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
you
have
a
truckload
situation
in
which
for
example
30,000
pounds
of
canned
goods
would
be
carried
on
a
vehicle
from
a
to
b,
from
one
consignor
to
the
one
consignee.
there
is
no
complaint
at
all
about
those
rates.
insofar
as
these
facts
are
concerned,
we
don't
have
any
problem
there.
but
if
you
carry
say,
5,000
pounds,
all
from
the
same
consignor
to
one
consignee
at
a
and
then
5,000
pounds
to
another
consignee
at
b
and
another
5,000
or
7,000
pounds
to
another
consignee
c,
this
man,
reddish,
had
a
stop-off
charge
which
he
imposed
presumably
but
was
not
charging.
the
common
carriers
were
wanting
to
impose
their
charges.
they
would
provide
that
kind
of
service.
they
had
the
stop-off
charge
for
that.
and
the
imposition
that
is
an
application
of
that
charge
did
lead
to
a
greater
cost
to
the
shipper.
and
they
had
never
been
approached
to
see
whether
or
not
the
level
of
that
total
charge
to
the
shipper
could
be
changed
to
make
it
acceptable
to
the
shipper.
in
other
words,
the
carrier
is
right
(voice
overlap)
mr.
roland
rice
there
is
some
evidence
of
solicitation
of
traffic.
mr.
roland
rice
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
that
they
had
offered
to
decrease
their
rates.
mr.
roland
rice
no.
no,
there
is
no
evidence
of
that,
your
honor.
i
simply
would
like
to
call
attention
again
to
the
schaffer
case,
and
to
read
this
one
sentence.
in
these
circumstances,
as
this
court
said
that
is,
where
you
have
motor
and
rail
carriers
involved,
and
not
just
one
mode.
in
these
circumstances,
a
rate
benefit
attributable
to
differences
between
the
two
modes
of
transportation
is
an
inherent
advantage
of
the
competing
type
of
carrier
and
cannot
be
ignored
by
the
commission.
let
me
go
ahead
and
say
that
--
mr.
roland
rice
i'm
quoting
that
--
mr.
roland
rice
well,
the
commission,
i
was
really
talking
about
whether
or
not
there
are
any
instances
in
which
the
commission
should
look
at
rates
and
i
said
that
the
court
in
the
schaffer
case
had
done
it
and
i
was
reading
the
language
there
in
which
this
court
as
i
understood
it
had
said
that
it
is
proper
for
the
commission
to
look
at
the
--
at
rates
where
different
modes
of
transportation
are
involved.
mr.
roland
rice
precisely
that.
mr.
roland
rice
no.
mr.
roland
rice
never
be
what?
mr.
roland
rice
well,
they
won't
be
--
mr.
roland
rice
no
they
wouldn't
--
mr.
roland
rice
i'm
saying
that
rates
do
not
properly
belong
in
a
service
case
when
somebody
needs
a
new
service.
let's
assume
a
man
--
mr.
roland
rice
not
only
--
mr.
roland
rice
i
mentioned
two
instances
in
which
i
know
that
they
may
lawfully
be
done.
one,
what
this
court
said
in
the
schaffer
case,
and
two,
where
there
is
an
in
effect
a
rate
so
high
as
to
constitute
an
embargo.
i
recognized
those
two
and
others,
i
don't
know
about.
mr.
roland
rice
there
is
temporary
requirement.
mr.
roland
rice
that's
precisely
the
way
it
would
be
done.
mr.
roland
rice
there
is
just
one
more
thing
that
i'd
like
to
say
about
these
rates
and
the
reason
why
they
should
not
be
considered
in
a
proceeding
having
to
do
with
operating
rights
and
that
is
that
if
the
commission
were
required
to
do
this,
anybody
could
come
up
to
the
commission
and
offer
a
lower
rate
than
the
published
rate
and
if
the
commission
is
required
to
grant
the
authority
sought
simply
because
the
lower
rate
is
proper,
we
would
invite
the
most
predatory
practices
that
both
the
congress
and
this
court
through
the
years
had
condemned.
mr.
roland
rice
i
don't
think
it
would
in
an
application
case
(voice
overlap)
mr.
roland
rice
i
don't
think
it
would
at
all
because
you
still
have
the
opportunity
to
examine
the
rates
under
a
rate
proceeding.
mr.
roland
rice
on
identical
service
your
honor
which
is
really
what
you
would
have
in
this
instance
as
i
see
it,
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
a
contract
carrier
can
perform
the
service
any
cheaper
than
the
common
carrier.
mr.
roland
rice
well,
that
all
depends
on
the
operating
authority
of
the
respective
carriers.
the
common
carrier
can
do
it
just
as
well
as
the
contract
carrier,
if
he
has
authority
to
reach
those
points.
what
mr.
ginnane
was
saying
as
i
understand
it
is
that
here
you
have
a
man
in
one
state,
seeking
authority
to
serve
every
point,
that
would
be
thousands
of
points
in
33
states
in
the
united
states
and
no
one
motor
carrier
has
the
authority
to
do
that
and
that's
why
they
can't
reach
all
of
these
points
and
make
all
of
these
multiple
deliveries.
they
could
make
some
in
many
instances
but
in
some
cases,
their
operating
authority
didn't
go
that
far.
mr.
roland
rice
there
would
be
some
benefit.
i
think
the
commission
realized
that,
but
at
about
394,
as
i
recall
it
in
the
record
here,
the
commission
weighed
all
that
and
came
up
finally
with
the
conclusion
that
the
act
and
the
policy
made
it
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
authority
should
not
be
granted.
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
for
that
is
that
unless
that
was
so,
unless
there
was
some
restrictions
upon
the
entry,
the
right
of
entry
into
regulated
transportation,
we
probably
have
multiple
thousands
of
carriers
and
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
that
is
in
line
with
the
transportation
policy
expressed
with
the
congress.
every
little
shipper
all
over
the
united
states
would
be
wanting
a
carrier
to
serve
all
of
his
consignees
throughout
all
of
48
states
or
50
or
such
of
them
as
those
to
which
he
sent
his
goods.
and
i
think
the
congress
has
looked
at
that
and
decided
that
that
is
not
a
good
way
to
establish
a
national
transportation
system.
you've
got
to
have
some
single
line
and
some
interline
in
order
to
have
a
sound
economic
transportation
system
to
serve
all
the
needs
of
all
the
people
and
it
cannot
be
perfect
in
either
situation.
thank
you.
