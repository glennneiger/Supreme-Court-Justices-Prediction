justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
i
want
to
ask
you
this.
in
ex
parte
united
states,
242,
which
you
refer
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
related
to
the
absence
of
power
of
a
judge
to
suspend
the
sentence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
case,
the
chief
justice
relied
very
largely
on
the
laws
of
the
state
on
that
point.
i
have
not
found
by
either.
you
refer
to
the
laws
of
the
states
on
this
point
as
to
the
power
of
a
judge
to
dispose
of
a
case
this
way
so
that
it
will
be
biased.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
look
into
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
you
find
no
cases
in
the
state?
i'm
surprised
at
this
because
i
know
from
personal
experience
of
many
years
in
which
judges
have,
as
they
said,
taken
the
bit
in
their
mouth
and
direct
an
acquittal
just
instantly,
maybe
when
the
first
witness
is
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
might
be
because
it
has
not
been
to
protect
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
when
we
agree
as
to
that,
i
recall
during
the
prohibition
case,
there
are
many
cases
where
the
governor
was
not
allowed
to
get
very
far
for
the
judge
could
direct
a
verdict.
it
was
just
a,
frankly,
from
my
own
observation
in
some
places,
a
common
experience.
and,
i
had
--
i
do
not
recall
myself
that
it
had
ever
been
challenged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alabama.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
general
rule
--
the
general
idea
was,
in
what
might
be
a
very
arbitrary
action
on
the
part
of
the
judge,
nevertheless,
under
the
doctrine
of
former
jeopardy,
the
government
had
no
relief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
those
cases
to
indicate
that
the
rule
would
have
been
announced
the
same
had
the
action
of
the
court
been
to
direct
an
acquittal,
rather
than
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
direct
a
mistrial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
main
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
you
find
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
is
of
some
relevance
to
me
and,
therefore,
did
you
find
any
case
in
any
state
where
they
had
permitted
a
second
trial
after
a
judge
--
after
the
case
had
come
on
the
trial,
not
been
completed,
and
the
judge
took
the
bit
in
his
mouth
and
directed
an
acquittal?
did
you
find
any
case
where
they
had
allowed
him
to
be
tried
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
connecticut
passed
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
reason
i
asked
the
question,
if
they
had
passed
on
an
acquittal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
may
say
that
it
may
be
unique
in
the
time
lo
--
time
--
years
that
i've
practiced,
it
was
not
unknown.
