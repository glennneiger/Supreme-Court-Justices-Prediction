mr.
arthur
richenthal
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices
may
it
please
the
court.
the
two
individual
petitioners,
fong
foo
and
robert
knupp,
and
their
corporate
employer
were
indicted
for
having
falsified
and
concealed
and
conspiring
to
falsify
and
conceal
material
facts
from
the
army
signal
supply
agency,
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government,
and
its
government
inspector
during
the
performance
of
two
contracts.
the
petitioners
were
brought
to
trial
before
judge
wyzanski
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
massachusetts
which
had
jurisdiction
to
try
the
defendants
and
jurisdiction
over
the
offenses
charged.
a
jury
was
empanelled.
an
opening
statement
was
made
by
the
prosecution,
an
evidence
was
presented
through
witnesses,
the
principal
one,
being
the
government
inspector
named
konstanz
paliotto.
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
trial,
judge
wyzanski
directed
an
acquittal
of
the
three
petitioners
prior
to
the
government
resting
its
case,
telling
them
that
their
bail
was
discharged
and
that
they
were
free.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
trial.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
there
had
been
four
government
witnesses
called
after
the
opening
of
the
--
by
the
prosecution,
and
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
to
pick
the
jury?
as
i
recall,
the
record
doesn't
show
it,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
i
think
it
took
one
day.
judgment
of
acquittal
was
entered
the
day
after
mr.
judge
wyzanski
freed
the
defendants.
about
45
days
later,
the
government
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
from
the
united
states'
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
anglo-american
jurisprudence,
the
court
below
issued
a
writ
of
mandamus
vacating
a
judgment
of
acquittal
in
a
criminal
proceeding
and
directing
that
petitioners
be
tried
again
for
the
same
offense.
it
is
our
position,
sirs,
that
the
constitution,
statutes,
and
judicial
decisions
make
it
clear
that
there
can
be
no
review
of
a
judgment
of
acquittal
by
an
appellate
court,
whether
by
appeal,
mandamus,
or
in
any
other
form.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
yes,
sir,
in
a
double
jeopardy
jurisdiction.
we
have
taken
the
position
and
argued
extensively
in
our
briefs
that
the
government
has
no
right
of
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
and
cannot
utilize
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
bring
up
for
review
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
we
have
set
out
the
history
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
and
the
cases
showing
the
congressional
and
judicial
hostility
to
the
use
of
mandamus
to
circumvent
the
lack
of
a
right
of
appeal.
it
is
our
position
that
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
once
ended
by
a
court
that
has
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
and
over
the
cause,
may
not
be
inquired
into
and
petitioners
may
not
be
brought
to
the
bar
again.
the
way
we
understand
the
law,
it
is
unnecessary
for
any
inquiry
to
be
made
into
the
expressed
or
unexpressed
reasons
of
why
an
acquittal
was
entered.
and
particularly
as
this
so,
where
no
question
is
raised
as
to
the
good
faith
of
the
district
judge,
it's
for
this
reason
that
we
ask
the
court's
indulgence
and
i'm
not
setting
forth
at
this
point
of
our
argument
a
detailed
statement
of
the
facts
which
we
shall
attempt
to
go
into,
in
answer
to
the
government's
arguments,
if
time
permits.
there
is
and
can
be
no
case
cited
by
the
government
as
valid
for
the
proposition
that
an
acquittal
can
be
vacated
and
the
defendants
try
it
again.
one
of
the
maxims
in
our
common
law
heritage
is
that
an
acquittal
entered
is
forever
a
bar
to
further
prosecution
for
the
same
offense.
this,
we
believe,
is
of
itself
significant
in
the
hundreds
of
years
of
criminal
prosecution.
this
fundamental
concept
that
an
acquittal
is
sacred
and
inviolable
is
so
strong
that
obviously,
it
is
not
surprising,
that
the
question
has
not
often
been
raised
in
an
appellate
court.
there
is
no
decision
to
parallel
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
this
case.
it
is
significant,
however,
that
in
the
two
cases
where
the
government
has
raised
this
question,
one
in
this
country
and
one
in
england,
the
government's
contention
has
been
rejected.
we
specifically
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
decision
of
the
unanimous
bench
in
united
states
versus
weissman,
which
was
decided
in
1924
by
mr.
justice
holmes.
in
that
case,
the
district
court
directed
a
verdict
of
acquittal
prior
to
the
submission
of
any
evidence,
no
witnesses
before
it.
it
was,
in
effect,
a
discharge
of
the
indictment.
by
writ
of
error,
the
government
raised
before
this
court
the
same
issues
it
is
raising
today,
that
that
trial
was
no
hearing
and
that
the
trial,
in
effect,
was
a
nullity.
mr.
justice
holmes,
speaking
for
unanimous
court,
affirmed
the
principle
that
once
a
defendant
is
before
a
properly
constituted
court
which
has
jurisdiction
of
the
defendant
and
the
cause
and
a
judgment
of
acquittal
has
been
entered,
nothing
could
be
done
to
set
aside
such
an
acquittal.
as
we
read
united
states
versus
weissman,
the
only
facts
that
are
pertinent
are
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
party
and
the
cause
and
a
verdict
of
acquittal
entered.
under
that
decision,
we
respectfully
submit
the
appellate
inquiry
should
end.
it
is
significant,
your
honors,
that
united
states
versus
weissman
was
not
even
referred
to
in
the
majority
opinion
in
the
lower
court.
now,
i
ask
the
court's
permission
to
explore
in
detail
a
very
important
english
case
which
is
on
all
force
with
this
case.
in
the
weissman
case,
the
issue
came
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
error.
in
the
english
case,
it
came
up
exactly
in
this
form
by
writ
of
mandamus.
i
refer
to
a
decision
decided
by
the
queen's
bench
in
1952
entitled
regina
versus
middlesex
justices.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
yes,
it's
cited
in
the
briefs,
and
particularly
in
the
individual
petitioner's
brief.
in
that
case,
the
trial
court
directed
a
verdict
of
acquittal
after
the
opening
by
the
crown,
and
prior
to
the
submission
of
any
evidence,
the
court
told
the
jury
it
had
read
pretrial
depositions.
the
record
reveals
that
the
judge
had
been
exposed
to
three
pretrial
depositions,
one
from
the
policeman
who
arrested
the
defendant,
who
incidentally
have
been
charged
with
drunk
in
driving,
and
he
said
he
saw
the
car
weaving
in
and
out,
go
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road,
and
hit
the
curve,
a
disinterested
witness
who
has
been
driving
at
the
back
of
the
car,
in
effect,
said
the
same
thing.
a
doctor
who
examined
the
defendant
shortly
after
he
had
been
arrested
said
he
had
been
intoxicated,
and
attached
to
the
doctor's
deposition
were
some
handwritten
statements
of
the
defendant.
the
trial
judge
said
that
from
the
handwritten
statements,
he
concluded,
that
the
defendant
had
not
been
driving
while
drunk.
incidentally,
those
statements
of
an
educated
man
indicated
a
misspelling
of
his
street
and
of
his
town.
the
crown
felt
that
this
was
a
very
important
case
and
took
the
appeal
by
writ
of
man
--
took
--
brought
it
up
by
writ
of
mandamus
because
they
had
no
right
of
appeal.
and,
the
queen's
bench
excoriated
the
lower
court
judge
but
held
it
could
not
and
would
not
go
and
back
of
the
verdict
of
acquittal.
now
the
government,
apparently,
recognizes
the
significance
of
the
middlesex
justice
case
because
it
takes
four
pages
of
its
brief
and
attempts
to
distinguish
it,
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
such
distinction
is
without
any
validity.
they
try
to
say
that
in
the
middlesex
case,
the
judge
dismissed,
i
quote,
“with
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
the
prosecution's
case.”
and
judge
wyzanski
dismissed,
quote
in
italics,
“without
knowledge.”
i
bring
to
this
court's
attention
that
when
mr.
judge
wyzanski
dismissed,
he
had
had
eight
days
of
trial
and
600
pages
of
testimony.
he
had
had
colloquies
with
counsel
at
the
bench
who
had
explained
their
case.
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
case,
he
had
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
he
had
motions
for
bill
of
particulars,
he
had
bills
of
particulars
filed.
certainly,
judge
wyzanski
had
full
knowledge
of
the
prosecution's
case
when
he
made
this
decision.
on
the
issue
before
the
appellate
court,
we
submit,
once
a
verdict
of
acquittal
has
been
entered,
it
is
unnecessary
whether
the
judge
is
familiar
or
not
familiar
with
what
the
government
intends
to
prove.
and
the
middlesex
decision
does
not
go
on
the
content
of
the
record.
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
excoriate
the
judge
and
for
that
reason,
it
pointed
out
that
though
he
said
he
had
read
the
depositions,
it
was
fairly
obvious
that
he
have
not.
we
submit,
sir,
that
the
risk
of
error
or
impropriety
of
what
the
judge
has
done
must
be
borne
by
the
government
once
it
has
had
an
opportunity
to
appear
before
a
court
which
has
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
and
the
cause.
now,
it
is
obvious
that
this
background
of
non-reviewability
lies
not
only
in
the
inherent
jurisdiction
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
lack
of
any
right
of
appeal.
but
in
the
principle
of
the
fifth
amendment,
petitioners
are
entitled
to
the
full
protection
of
that
amendment.
there
is
no
question
that
these
defendants
were
in
jeopardy
in
the
first
trial
in
front
of
judge
wyzanski.
one
need
only
have
seen
fong
foo
who
lost
15
pounds
during
the
13
days
and
heard
the
outburst
of
tears
of
knupp
and
foo
when
judge
wyzanski
told
them
that
they
were
free
and
that
their
bail
was
terminated.
no
matter
what
label
is
put
upon
the
action
of
the
trial
judge,
realistically,
these
defendants
have
now
been
placed
in
second
jeopardy.
i
would
like
to
read
a
very
relevant
quote
from
this
court
in
united
states
versus
ball,
one
of
the
leading
double
jeopardy
cases.
“the
verdict
of
acquittal
was
final
and
could
not
be
reviewed
on
error
or
otherwise
without
putting
the
defendant
twice
in
jeopardy
and,
thereby,
violating
the
constitution.”
by
this
mandamus,
if
sustained,
the
government
has
obtained
in
the
appellate
court
that
which
the
lower
court
refused
to
give
them,
an
acquittal,
that
which
--
i
missed
the
trail,
excuse
me,
sir.
the
government
tries
to
utilize
this
court's
opinion
in
the
gori
case
as
a
basis
for
supporting
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
as
we
read
the
gori
case,
the
rationale
of
that
is
that
a
trial
judge
should
be
free
to
exercise
its
most
sensitive
judgment
for
the
more
effective
protection
of
the
criminal
accused,
and
there
is
a
basic
distinction
between
the
gori
case
and
this
case.
the
trial
judge
in
the
gori
case
intended
a
mistrial.
here,
the
trial
judge
intended
to
free
the
defendants.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
our
position
would
be
that
that
verdict
could
be
reviewed
in
any
way,
that
direction
of
acquittal.
that
the
government
ran
the
risk
of
what
their
functionaries
did.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
think
that
one
error
of
the
lower
court
is
an
attempt
to
analyze
and
psychoanalyze
what
the
judge
did.
the
judge
verbalized
something
which
was
triggered
by
misconduct
of
the
united
states
attorney,
but
he
wasn't
writing
an
opinion.
he
was
explaining
to
a
jury
why
he
was
performing
his
civic
duty
of
directing
a
verdict
of
acquittal
and
excusing
them.
and,
we
say
that
this
kind
of
decision
opens
up,
in
every
case,
what
motivated
the
judge.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
and
we
have
a
sub-trial
now
under
the
issue
of
(inaudible)
if
this
decision
should
be
sustained.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
we
say
that
the
verdict
of
acquittal,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
non-reviewable
even
if
it'd
be
done
for
the
misconduct,
or
more
so
if
it'd
be
done
for
the
misconduct
of
the
united
states
attorney,
if
you
do
want
to
go
into
reasons.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we
certainly
do.
we
say
an
absolute
necessity
under
our
common
law
principles
and
under
the
constitution
and
under
the
statutes.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
if
i
can
quote,
i
think,
you
have
taken
a
line
that
i
was
going
to
take
legal
license
with
from
gertrude
stein
and
say
“an
acquittal
is
an
acquittal
is
an
acquittal,”
sir.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
the
constitution
gives
a
defendant
the
right
not
to
be
placed
twice
in
jeopardy,
and
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
well,
the
objective
guide
of
whether
you've
been
placed
in
jeopardy
certainly
is
an
acquittal.
now,
in
this
particular
court,
in
the
gori
case,
when
the
court,
when
it
has
fought,
as
has
been
going,
in
mistrial
cases,
the
court
specifically
excluded
from
its
decision,
i'm
now
referring
to
the
majority
opinion,
sir.
the
situation
where
the
prosecution
has
given
another
more
favorable
opportunity
to
convict
the
accused
and
certainly,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
exists
in
this
case.
this
case
was
going
very
poorly
for
the
government.
mr.
justice
wyzanski,
at
the
end
of
the
second
day,
warned
him
that
he
was
going
to
take
drastic
action.
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
day,
he
called
the
u.s.
attorney
into
a
conference
and
recommended
that
they
now
thrust.
he
told
them
that
an
ineradicable
impression
had
been
made
upon
the
jury
that
if
a
verdict
had
been
brought
in
against
these
defendants,
he'd
have
to
set
this
aside.
if
evident,
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
should
apply,
it
should
apply
in
a
situation
where
the
case
was
going
so
favorably
and
where
the
judge
intended
to
acquit
the
people.
now,
what
is
the
government's
answer
to
the
historic
background
of
non-reviewability
as
evidence
in
our
view
of
the
law
by
judge
weissman
--
judge
holmes
decision
in
the
weissman
case
and
regina
versus
middlesex
and
the
queen's
bench
decision
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
well,
we
submit
sir,
that
this
case
cannot
be
brought
here
under
the
criminals
appeals
act.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
no.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
the
only
similarity,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
that
in
that
case,
an
examination
of
the
government's
briefs
indicate
that
they
may
be
identical
arguments
insofar
as
no
hearing
is
concerned
and
nullity.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
well,
this
is
--
these
are
the
government
lawyers,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
and,
mr.
justice
holmes
saw
fit
to
address
itself
--
himself
to
that
argument.
now,
in
this
case,
they
make
those
arguments
that
there
was
no
hearing,
everything
below
is
a
nullity
and
therefore,
these
defendants
were
not
in
jeopardy.
we
submit
the
hearing
to
which
they
were
entitled
was
accorded
to
them,
namely,
an
appearance
before
a
properly
constituted
court
which
had
jurisdiction.
now,
the
government
is
faced
with
the
problem
of
what
is
the
power
of
the
judge
to
direct
a
verdict
of
acquittal
and
when.
and
even
they
are
compelled
in
their
briefs
to
admit
that
the
judge
can
direct
a
verdict
of
acquittal
prior
to
their
putting
in
their
full
case
where
an
essential
fact
in
the
judge's
view,
whether
erroneously
or
not,
has
not
been
made
out.
now,
we
submit
here
that
an
essential
part
of
the
government's
case
was
not
made
out.
in
their
opening
statement,
they
told
the
jury
and
the
court
that
they
would
have
to
understand
the
testing
of
the
device
involved
before
getting
to
the
question
of
whether
there
had
been
fraudulent
testing.
now,
this
court
must

should
understand
that
the
device
involved
is
a
complicated
electronic
device
called
a
radiosonde
which
is
dropped
from
a
plane
by
a
parachute
and,
as
it
passes
through
the
air,
returns
to
a
receiver
by
morse
code

temperature,
the
humidity,
and
the
pressure
of
the
air
as
it's
going
down.
the
government
made
it
absolutely
clear,
and
i've
read
--
refer
to
page
70
of
the
record,
that
the
first
part
of
its
case
would
be
an
explanation
of
this
complicated
device
and
it
put
on
the
stand
mr.
paliotto,
who
was
the
principal
witness
for
the
government.
the
record
reveals
he
had
been
the
chief
inspector
at
the
defendant
corporate
plant.
he
had
designated
the
tests
which
were
involved
in
the
indictment
and
evaluated
them.
he
had
personally
initiated
the
fbi
investigation
and
he
personally
had
custody
of
the
tapes
which
allegedly
embodied
the
false
testing.
his
testimony
was
technical
and
difficult
to
follow.
he
admitted
he
had
difficulty
explaining
that
as
to
lay
people
even
though
he
was
a
government
inspector
at
the
defendant
plant.
the
judge's
vigilance
was
particularly
provoked
at
the
commencement
of
the
second
day
of
trial
by
mr.
paliotto
description
of
a
test
operation
as
resulting
in
spurious
marks
on
a
piece
of
paper.
when
questioned
by
the
judge,
he
explained
that
spurious
meant
instantaneous,
on
the
spur
of
the
moment.
the
judge
cautioned
the
witness
on
the
use
of
such
language
in
criminal
cases
involving
fraudulent
testing.
further
on
that
day,
mr.
paliotto
identified
the
document
as
prepared
by
an
agent
of
the
company
which
turned
out
to
be
a
government
inspector's
worksheet.
the
judge
ordered
and
i
quote,
“this
misleading
exhibit
to
be
taken
from
the
jury.”
at
this
stage,
it
was
a
friday,
the
judge
told
the
government
that
he
would
be
compelled
to
take,
“drastic
action
if
the
case
were
not
better
prepared
in
connection
with
the
technical
matters.”
thereafter,
on
further
testimony,
when
the
case
reconvened
after
the
weekend,
mr.
paliotto
came
up
with
inconsistent
and
contradictory
statements
on
very
important
matters,
such
as
the
destruction
of
his
notes
on
his
activities
as
an
inspector
and
the
date
of
destruction.
and
then,
the
most
important
incident
arose.
he
admitted
and
changed
his
testimony
that
he
had
actually
destroyed
the
tapes
which
embodied
the
false
testing
and
that
such
destruction
took
place
after
the
commencement
of
the
criminal
investigation
which
he
had
invoked
by
going
to
the
fbi
and
this,
in
light
of
a
promise
on
the
record
by
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney,
that
the
defendants
would
have
the
test
tapes
available
to
them.
it
was
when
this
contradictory
testimony
came
out
on
the
fifth
day
that
mr.
justice
wyzanski
called
the
u.s.
attorney
to
the
bench
and
recommended
to
him
that
on
this
record
this
case
should
be
nolle
pros.
he
said,
“this
has
gone
on
for
two
or
three
days.”
mr.
arthur
richenthal
page
359,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
am
going
to
tell
you
that
if
i
were
the
united
states
attorney
in
this
case
and
my
principal
witness
was
testifying
as
this
witness
had
done,
i
would
forthwith
nolle
pros
the
case.
recognizing
the
seriousness
of
this
charge,
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney,
who
had
rather
ineptly
tried
the
case,
called
upon
his
boss
and
they
waited
until
mr.
richardson
came
down
into
the
courtroom
and
the
judge
noted
that
mr.
richardson
had
joined
government
counsel
and
then,
explaining
to
mr.
richardson,
he
said
to
him,
“the
cold
record
perhaps
inadequately
conveys
the
total
picture
as
it
has
developed
in
the
last
few
days
of
testimony
and
in
particular,
the
testimony
of
the
witness
paliotto
was
on
the
stand.
further
on
that
page,
he
says,
“on
one
occasion,
he
will
give
an
answer
in
the
affirmative.
a
few
minutes
later
when
the
situation
has
really
not
changed,
in
any
respect,
he
takes
a
diametrically
opposite
position.
he
seems
not
to
realize
the
ambiguity
his
testimony
has
created.
he
seems
to
be
unresponsive
to
repeated
warnings
by
the
court
that
there
could
be
no
more
serious
matter
than
the
offering
of
testimony
in
a
criminal
case
and
that
the
witness
should
pause
and
reflect
if
these
are
invalid,
but
should
not
plunge
himself
and
the
rest
of
us
into
a
series
of
confusions.”
mr.
arthur
richenthal
no,
the
jury
had
been
excused,
mr.
justice
harlan.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
judge
made
it
clear
that
if
there
were
any
members
of
the
press
present,
he
would
hold
them
in
contempt
if
they
dealt
with
this
conference.
this
was
completely
between
him
and
the
prosecuting
attorneys.
and,
he
ended
up
on
page
362
by
saying,
“i
can't
feel
that
any
trust
could
be
placed
in
this
witness
and
if,
in
the
end,
the
jury
did
believe
this
witness,
i
think
it
would
be
almost
inevitable
that
i
would
have
to
set
aside
the
verdict,
as
not
being
a
verdict
which
could
be
granted
full
credit,
as
being
a
verdict
based
upon
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.”
mr.
richardson
was
insistent.
he
went
ahead
and
explained
that
they
had
other
witnesses.
the
judge
was
indulgent.
he
went
on
with
the
case.
he
went
on
with
the
case
for
another
three
days.
when
mr.
paliotto
finished,
they
called
their
next
principal
witness,
one
mr.
rosenholm
who
was
an
employee
of
the
corporate
defendant,
had
been
inspector
in
the
plant,
named
as
a
co-conspirator
but
not
a
defendant
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
with
this
witness,
there
was
a
change
of
vital
testimony
with
respect
to
test
cards
and
conversations
with
respect
to
dealing
with
the
test
cards.
the
witness
revoked
the
entire
situation
and
finally
said
it
hadn't
happen.
then,
the
situation
arose
which
triggered
the
directed
verdict.
the
witness
rosenholm
testified
to
a
conversation
with
company
counsel
and
placed
the
conversation
in
february
1958.
the
indictment
charges
a
conspiracy
from
september
1956
to
november
1957.
when
attorneys
for
the
defendant
raised
a
question
of
lawyer-client
privilege,
the
attorneys
had
a
colloquy
at
the
bench
and
defended
--
the
government's
counsel
explained
that
this
was
a
key
conversation
and
that
it
was
through
the
knowledge
of
the
attorney
for
the
company
that
they
were
going
to
attribute
knowledge
to
the
corporation
and
it
was
an
essential
part
of
the
conspiracy.
the
judge
saw
many
problems
arising
under
the
lawyer-client
privilege
and
declared
a
recess
to
give
the
u.s.
attorney
an
opportunity
to
lay
the
proper
basis
to
get
this
evidence
in
the
record.
they
convened
overnight.
the
next
day,
mr.
rosenholm
took
the
stand,
continuing
in
direct
examination
with
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
examining.
he
then
changed
the
date
of
this
key
conversation
to
september
1957
and
placed
it
directly
in
the
conspiracy.
on
cross-examination
later
that
day,
defendant's
counsel
brought
out
that
out
of
the
courtroom,
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
had
refreshed
the
recollection
of
the
witness
rosenholm
for
the
changed
date.
the
judge,
in
our
opinion,
very
properly
told
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
that
such
change
should
have
taken
place
with
the
witness
on
the
stand
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
jury,
and
defendant's
counsel.
and,
this
event,
your
honors,
triggered
on
the
eighth
day,
after
all
this
patience
and
indulgence,
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
make
clear
that,
on
the
--
on
our
position
as
to
the
non-reviewability
of
a
verdict
of
acquittal
that
i
need
not
have
gone
into
the
explanation
of
the
trial
in
the
district
court.
i
did
that,
however,
to
make
clear
to
the
court
that,
in
answer
to
the
government's
position
that
a
district
court
judge
does
have
the
power
to
direct
a
verdict
of
acquittal
where
the
government
has
failed
to
make
out
an
essential
part
of
its
case,
whether
erroneous
or
not.
and,
i
wanted
to
make
clear
that
on
this
record,
on
the
theory
of
the
trial,
an
essential
part
of
the
government's
case
was
an
explanation
of
the
operation
of
this
electronic
device
which
clearly
was
not
made
out
due
to
the
inadequate,
incredible
testimony
of
the
government
inspector.
and,
i
do
want
to
say,
in
answer
to
one
question
from
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
the
misconduct
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
in
our
opinion,
was
not
the
reason
for
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
but,
rather,
it
made
a
bad
government
case
impossible
and
triggered
the
final
action
of
the
court.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
well,
i
respectfully
feel
it
was
a
bad
government
case,
sir.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
now,
coming
back
to
the
government's
alleged
distinction
of
regina
versus
middlesex,
i
think
it
must
become
fairly
obvious
on
an
examination
of
the
record
that,
certainly,
their
distinction
that
judge
wyzanski
acted
without
knowledge
of
the
government's
case
is
a
distinction
without
any
validity
because,
after
all
the
eight
days
of
testimony,
and
all
the
proceedings
and
briefs
that
had
taken
place
and
colloquies
with
counsel,
he
knew
much
more
than
the
judge
who
claimed
to
have
read
the
depositions
in
the
middlesex
justice
case.
in
passing,
i
ask
the
court
to
read
the
queen's
bench
decision,
not
the
english
report
decision
which
is
quoted.
the
queen's
bench
decision
is
the
one
referred
to
in
the
government's
brief.
now,
we
urge
upon
the
court
to
continue
the
historic
principle
that
a
verdict
of
acquittal
is
not
reviewable
and,
certainly,
should
not
be
reviewed
in
the
instant
case.
we
feel
by
giving
an
independent
judiciary,
this
non-reviewable
right
is
no
more
horrendous
than
giving
the
government
attorney
the
right
to
nolle
pros
in
criminal
proceedings
which
right
is
non-reviewable
on
a
much
broader
scale.
we
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
order
of
the
first
circuit.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
first,
in
un
--
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
about
state
authorities,
the
solicitor
general's
office
may
not
have
unearthed
any
but
i'm
pleased
that
our
office
did.
and,
i
call
your
attention
to
pages
54
and
55
of
our
brief
where
we
set
forth
many
cases
in
double
jury
--
in
double
jeopardy
jurisdictions
which
have
ruled
on
this
question
and
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
the
corporate
brief.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
page
54
and
55.
i
particularly
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
reasoning
of
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
kentucky
which
his
completely
applicable
to
the
instant
situation.
under
these
circumstances,
the
situation
was
precisely
the
same,
as
if
the
trial
judge
had
peremptorily
instructed
the
jury
to
acquit
the
defendant
after
the
evidence
for
the
commonwealth
was
in
or
at
the
conclusion
of
all
the
evidence,
and
in
obedience
to
such
instruction,
he
was
acquitted
and
discharged.
of
course,
in
such
a
state
of
case,
the
judgment
of
acquittal
would
be
a
bar
to
another
prosecution
for
the
same
offense.
the
fact
that
this
power
places
great
authority
in
the
hands
of
the
circuit
judges
does
not
furnish
sufficient
reason
to
depart
from
the
long-established
rule
of
practice
that
such
a
proceeding
is
a
bar
to
another
prosecution
for
the
same
offense.
the
circuit
judges
of
the
state
are
necessarily
and
properly
invested
with
large
power
and
discretion
in
directing
the
control
and
disposition
of
criminal
cases
and,
if
there
should
occasionally
be
a
miscarriage
of
justice
on
account
of
an
erroneous
decision
of
the
judge,
an
exceptional
mistake
like
this
should
not
be
allowed
to
overturn
a
firmly
set
of
principles
in
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
i
submit,
if
the
court
goes
into
the
facts,
you
will
find
that
it's
pretty
close
in
point.
they
called
off
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal,
as
i
recall.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
because
the
prosecutor
witnesses
were
not
present.
they
never
even
went
to
trial
on
the
issue.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
all
i
do
is
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
directed
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
you're
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
mr.
justice
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
i
agree.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
the
only
issue
i
want
to
make
is
the
ju
--
the
government
tries
to
make
an
acquittal,
a
certification
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
there
are
many
instances
in
our
system
where
it
is
not
a
certification
of
guilt
or
innocence,
many
in
which
this
court
has
passed
upon
and
many
high
state
courts,
in
addition
to
that.
and,
it
is
nothing
contrary
to
our
system
not
to
have
a
complete
certification.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
it
is
unique
occurrence
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
here,
the
solicitor
general
and
we
are
in
agreement.
there
is
no
such
case.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
connecticut
is
not
a
double
jeopardy
state,
sir.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
no,
it
has
not.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
they
have
not,
to
my
knowledge,
sir.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
answer
to
your
last
comment
about
unique
situations,
i
think
i
learned
under
you
that
these
unique
situations
had
cause
bad
law.
may
i
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
we
agree
with
that
position,
sir,
and
it
was
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
and
that
is
the
reason
why
there
is
lack
of
authority.
and,
i
think
the
reason
why
the
issue
is
here
today
is
the
use
of
mandamus
to
raise
the
question
when,
admittedly,
it
could
not
be
raised
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
in
a
form
of
bootstraps
argument,
in
effect,
by
using
the
aldrich
statute
which
never
gave
him
the
power
to
take
this
question
up
and
there
is
no
inherent
right
of
appeal
in
this
case.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
i
do
want
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
to
some
extent,
it
does,
your
honor.
i
want
to
make
this
distinction.
the
cases
which
the
solicitor
general
cited
on
issuing
a
bench
warrant
or
enforcing
a
statutory
sentence
are
compelling
a
judge
to
perform
an
act
which
he
is
supposed
to
perform.
they
do
not
involve
the
issue
in
this
case
where
the
judge
has
started
the
commencement
of
a
hearing
and
has
a
power
to
proceed.
the
solicitor
general
directed
himself
to
a
division
of
powers
argument
between
the
executive
and
the
judicial,
and
i
would
say
that
the
argument
is
on
the
other
foot.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
the
attorney
general's
office
is
seeking
to
exercise
judicial
powers
by
stopping
judge
wyzanski
from
ent
--
and
any
other
district
court
judge
from
entering
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
he
made
the
determination
that
the
prosecution's
case
was
defective
as
a
matter
of
law.
he
didn't
say
that
they
should
be
prosecuted.
he
didn't
say
they
should
be
taken
before
a
court.
he
directed
the
verdict
which
is
a
judicial
act
directly
within
his
powers.
he
did
it
for
reasons
which
were
based
on
the
record.
he
did
it
in
good
faith.
he
believed
it
to
be
legally
sufficient.
and,
at
that
point,
there
should
be
no
further
examination
of
his
action,
particularly
under
the
division
of
powers.
now,
the
absurdity
of
the
government's
argument
is
directed
to
the
question
which
was
raised
by
the
bench.
if
acquittal
is
given
before
the
government
rests,
then
the
court
of
appeals
can
review
the
record
and
that
involves
all
the
analysis
of
the
motives
that
went
into
the
judge
in
making
the
decision.
if
the
acquittal
is
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case,
it's
final.
now,
this
leaves
open
the
whole
area
of
the
judge's
right
to
exclude
evidence.
it
narrows
his
discretion
in
a
way
that's
never
been
narrowed
in
the
history
of
the
federal
judiciary.
it
creates
an
arbitrary,
an
unsound
rule.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
well,
this
is
our
interpretation,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
arthur
richenthal
well
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
or
--
mr.
arthur
richenthal
it
is
our
understanding
of
the
position
taken
in
their
brief
that
this
is
definitely
their
position
and
i
don't
know
how,
when
you
go
behind
all
the
language,
you
could
find
any
other
position
in
order
to
guide
future
courts
on
this
question.
in
passing
and
in
concluding,
i
should
like
to
tell
the
court
that,
as
i
listened
to
the
learned
solicitor
general's
argument
here
today,
i
felt
that
this
court
and
we
were
faced
with
an
argument
not
involving
any
defendants.
it's
as
though
there
was
an
issue
between
the
government
and
the
district
court
judge.
our
system
is
key
to
dealing
with
the
particular
case
and,
in
this
case,
we
have
defendants.
they
were
tried.
the
government
says
they
didn't
have
their
day
in
court.
we
say
they
had
eight
days
in
court.
the
government
says
there
was
no
hearing
because
the
government's
idea
of
the
kind
of
evidence
they
should've
listened
to
was
not
followed.
that,
simply,
is
the
government's
position.
now,
the
solicitor
general
very
fairly
made
a
statement
that
the
trial
was
going
well
for
these
defendants.
how,
on
that
basis,
can
this
acquittal
be
tortured
into
a
mistrial
and
these
defendants
be
sent
back
for
another
trial?
what
then
does
the
fifth
amendment
mean?
i
respectfully
submit
that,
on
any
one
of
three
alternative
grounds,
that
mandamus
is
not
a
proper
way
to
review
this
issue
which
is
barred
by
the
criminal
appeals
act.
that
the
district
court
has
inherent
power,
once
the
trial
starts,
to
run
that
courtroom
as
he
deems
proper
and
that
one
of
those
powers
is
the
direction
of
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
powers
that
he's
got
and
it
isn't
for
the
prosecution
to
say
“you
can
only
do
it
when
you
listen
to
the
amount
of
evidence
that
we
want
you
to
listen
to
or
you
sit
here
and
make
up
your
mind
at
the
end
of
two
witnesses
and
then
turn
off
your
hearing
aid.”
that
part
is
alright.
the
government
would
raise
that
question.
and,
if
we
take
the
statement
that
mr.
caner
made
during
the
nolle
pros
discussion
that
only
one
-tenth
of
the
case
was
in,
we
might
need
another
80
days
before
the
judge
could
turn
off
--
turn
that
hearing
aid
back
on
again.
this
is
the
absurdity
to
which
this
position
leads
us.
and,
lastly
and
most
importantly,
we
only
urge
it
because,
under
the
rules
of
statutory
construction,
this
court
often
prefers
to
decide
on
questions
other
than
constitutional
questions,
we
know
of
no
stronger
case
where
individual
defendants
are
entitled
to
the
bar
of
double
jeopardy
than
in
the
instant
case.
and,
on
all
the
applicable
decisions
of
this
court,
this
writ
of
mandamus
should
be
quashed
and
the
order
of
the
first
circuit
reversed.
thank
you.
