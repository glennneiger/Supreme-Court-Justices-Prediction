justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
you,
you
go
beyond
that.
i
was
once
present
in
court
waiting
for
a
case
when
one
of
the
most
eminent
district
judges
in
modern
history,
upon
the
opening
of
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
in
a
triple
damage
case
in
the
sherman
law
suit,
then
said,
“i
know
that
you
can't
prove
what
your
opening
said
you
undertake
to
prove.”
counsel
was
gesticulated,
objected
naturally.
and
the
judge
said,
“i
know
--
i
know
this
situation.
i
was
in
conflict
with
these
enterprises
for
nothing
for
10
years
before
i
went
on
the
bench.
you
can't
--
these
are
all
impossible
undertakings
you
make
and
i
direct
the
judgment
for
the
jury
for
the
defendant.”
now,
suppose
this
had
been
a
criminal
prosecution
under
the
sherman
law,
a
criminal
prosecution
in
conflict
with
the
government.
the
u.s.
attorney
makes
an
opening
statement
and
the
district
judge
says
“i
know
the
government
can't
possibly
prove
what
they
say
they'd
prove
when
i
direct
verdict
of
acquittal.”
you'd
say
that
that
is
understandable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
weissman
is
really
a
different
case
because
--
i
don't
know
why
you
have
to
rely
on
that
case,
why
you
think
its
(inaudible)
weissman
was
a
case
that
arose
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
and
that
is
a
specific
statutory
jurisdictional
statute,
and
that
case
held
that
that
is
not
a
res
--
that
it
could
not
be
brought
here
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
that's
all
it
held.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
that
is
--
that
is
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
talking
about
the
criminal
appeals
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
you
establish
by
that
statement
is
that
lawyers
make
all
sorts
of
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
make
all
sorts
of
arguments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
difficulty
is,
mr.
solicitor,
that
the
rights
are
correlative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
neither
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
if
one
reads
the
record
so
as
to
attribute
direction
of
acquittal
to
the
state
of
--
state
of
the
record,
then
it
does
become
important
to
decide
whether,
in
fact,
the
direction
was
attributable
to
his
notion
of
misconduct
by
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
or
whether
his
notion
of
the
misconduct
of
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
the
final
--
was
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel's
back.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
the
latter
--
if
that
was
the
final
thing
that
made
judge
wyzanski
act
and
all
the
prior
incidents
were
part
of
it,
then
you
have
a
customary
thing,
a
cumulated
causation
in
which
you
cannot
attribute
the
termination
of
the
trial
exclusive
to
what
he
has
no
business
to
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
punish
the
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of
the
misconduct
of
its
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
if
one
takes
judge
aldrich's
position,
then
it
is
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
we
have
crossed
that,
mr.
solicitor.
judge
aldrich
goes
on
the
ground
that
the
termination,
the
direction
of
acquittal,
was
due
to
judge
wyzanski's
interpretation
of
the
misconduct
of
the
u.s.
attorney,
rather,
his
assistant.
now,
if
you
say
that
that
was
nearly
the
last
clear
chance
that
he
gave
the
situation
but,
entering
into
his
judgment
of
his
view
of
the
whole
cause
of
proceeding,
then
you
do
have
to
face
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
face
the
position
taken
by
chief
judge
woodbury,
namely,
either
--
your
position,
either
on
an
a
fortiori
vote.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
therefore,
my
next
question
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
next
question
is,
can
you
really,
on
this
record,
isolate
the
last
item
of
a
transaction,
namely
his
feeling
that
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
was
guilty
of
misconduct
and,
therefore,
he's
going
to
put
an
end
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
isolate
that
as
the
abuse
--
not
abusive,
but
exercise
of
non-power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
if
we
--
if
one
takes
that
view,
as
one
might
under
a
court,
then
we
must.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
“can”
is
a
big
word.
is
it
fairly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
directed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
the
record,
sustained?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
little
too
refined
an
analysis
to
rest
on
the
truth
that
judge
aldrich
declined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
need
enlightenment
on
one
point.
you
say
it's
immaterial
whether
the
judge
is
right
or
wrong
in
thinking
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
was
guilty
of
misconduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
why,
you
say
that
because
the
judge's
interpretation
of
the
conduct
of
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
was
that
the
prosecution
was,
to
use
the
colloquialism,
was
doctoring
the
evidence.
and,
he
was
exercising
a
judgment
of
the
effect
on
getting
those,
being
able
to
accord
a
fair
trial
to
a
defendant
where
the
prosecution,
himself,
infuses
some
poison
into
the
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
judge
was
that
--
how
do
you
know?
he's
a
very
rapid
--
his
cerebration
is
very
rapid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
judge
doesn't
lay
there
his
intellectual
suggestion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
you've
read
only
bears
not
what
the
solicitor
general
said.
i
don't
think
it
makes
much
different,
but
what
you've
read
from
the
kentucky
case
is
to
acquit
the
defendant
after
evidence
for
the
commonwealth
was
in
and
the
whole
case
of
the
government
is
that
it's
evidence
for
the
commonwealth
to
which
the
united
states
wasn't
allowed
to
be
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
any
more
accept
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
any
more
accept
this,
the
weight
you
attach
to
this
quotation,
which
looks
all
the
other
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
the
common
place
being
about
deciding
whether
continuance
should
be
granted,
the
government
can't
go
on,
it
hasn't
got
its
witnesses,
the
court
said
that's
too
bad,
that's
your
lookout
and,
if
you
can't
go
on,
on
what
we've
got
now,
there's
no
choice
for
me
but
to
direct
an
acquittal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
it's
worthwhile
taking
your
time.
all
i'm
saying
is
the
problem
you
make
looks
in
the
other
direction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
both
you
and
the
solicitor
general
would
say
that
you
didn't
find
any
because,
happily,
this
is
rather
a
unique
occurrence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
are
two
aspects
of
this
mandamus
problem.
if
the
government
is
right,
if
this
was
a
lawless
behavior
and
the
consequence
of
the
lawless
behavior
was
a
nullity,
was
a
judicial
nullity,
was
a
legal
nullity,
then,
certainly,
mandamus
would
be
an
appropriate
remedy.
the
other
aspect
of
it
is,
if
there's
doubt
about
it,
should
mandamus
be
invoked?
but,
if
the
government
is
right,
certainly,
if
there
is
a
nullity
and
the
record,
he
is
acquitted
of
the
law.
and,
the
government
goes
in
and
says
he
shouldn't
be
acquitted
of
the
law
but
he
should
be
tried
again
and,
in
order
to
accomplish
that
conclusion,
except
by
mandamus,
just
as
ex
parte
united
states
was
by
way
of
mandamus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
mandamus
question
turns
on
the
substantive
merits
of
the
case.
