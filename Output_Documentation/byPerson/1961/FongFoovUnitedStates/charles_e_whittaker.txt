mr.
solicitor
general,
in
the
matter
of
the
provocations
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
any
event,
whatever
the
proper
term,
they
were,
utmost,
mere
error,
weren't
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
if
the
judge's
interrogations
and
his
method
of
interrogating
had
provoked
the
uncertainty
in
the
witness'
testimony,
that's
still
mere
error,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
this.
suppose,
after
this
testimony
of
these
witnesses
had
been
heard,
court
was
impressed
that
they
were
incredible
and
did
not
constitute
a
responsible
basis
upon
which
to
build
and
he,
therefore,
made
up
his
mind
that
whatever
else
happen,
the
judgment
--
he
couldn't
submit
the
case
and
he,
in
effect,
said
or
expressly
said,
“whatever
else
you
offer
will
be
irrelevant,”
and
then
perforce
the
ruling
the
prosecution
was
required
to
suspend
and
he
--
the
court
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
would
that
be
good?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
after
this
evidence
is
in,
the
court
says,
“whatever
else
happens
will
be
irrelevant.”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
--
cannot
put
on
any
more
evidence.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
he
said
it
will
be
irrelevant
because
of
what's
already
happened
and,
in
effect,
that
means,
“whatever
else
you
offer
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i'll
exclude.”
