mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
very
extraordinary
case,
we
base
our
case
upon
three
propositions.
first,
we
assert
the
basic
right
of
people
to
be
heard
in
the
prosecution
of
a
valid
indictment.
when
a
defendant
has
been
charged
with
crime
by
the
grand
jury
in
a
lawful
indictment,
then,
we
submit,
the
district
judge
has
no
power
to
bar
prosecution
by
entering
a
judgment
of
acquittal
without
a
hearing.
i
simply
illustrate
the
proposition
by
putting
a
converse
case.
if
a
judge
were
trying
a
criminal
defendant
without
a
jury
and,
at
the
end
of
hearing
two
character
witnesses
for
the
defense,
the
judge
were
to
say
“nothing
can
convince
me
that
this
scoundrel
is
innocent.
i
find
him
guilty
and
enter
judgment
forthwith.”
that
that
judgment
would
not
merely
be
erroneous,
but
that
the
judgment
would
be
void
and
could
be
collaterally
attacked
years
later
on
habeas
corpus
or
under
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
because
my
hypothesis
in
this
case,
the
judge
was
trying
the
case
without
a
jury.
i
meant
--
i
think
i
stated
that
in
the
facts.
i
meant
to.
no,
because
he
would've
denied
a
fair
hearing
and,
also,
our
case
is
the
converse,
we
submit,
that
essentially
the
same
proposition
stands.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
in
all
respects
and
the
fact
that
that
is
the
law
in
one
case
does
not
establish
that
it
is
the
law
in
the
other.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
shall
submit
that
they
should
be
correlative
and
will
go
on
to
develop
my
reasons,
if
i
may,
a
little
later.
our
second
proposition
is
that,
where
the
judge
--
where
the
district
court
has
exercised
this
non-judicial
function
and
is,
therefore,
refusing
to
try
the
indictment,
that
mandamus
is
the
proper
remedy
to
expunge
the
non-judicial
action
and
to
order
the
court
to
proceed
to
do
its
duty
to
put
the
case
to
trial.
my
third
proposition
has
to
be,
of
course,
is
that
the
constitutional
limitation
against
placing
a
defendant
in
double
jeopardy
does
not
bar
further
prosecution
of
this
indictment.
before
developing
these
points,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
were
to
describe
once
again
what
was
involved
in
this
case
and
what
took
place
at
the
trial.
the
indictment
was
under
the
false
statements
act
and
for
a
conspiracy
to
submit
false
statements
to
the
government.
the
defendant
corporation
had
agreed
to
manufacture
and
sell
certain
radiosondes,
a
device
which
is
dropped
from
an
airplane
at
a
high
altitude,
a
parachute
then
opens,
there
is
a
certain
shock
at
that
point,
and
the
parachute
then
allows
the
device
to
float
to
earth.
the
device
is
used
in
weather
forecasting.
it
transmits
signals
which,
if
the
device
is
accurate,
enable
an
instrument
on
the
ground
to
record
signals
which,
in
turn,
tell
the
operator
what
the
temperature,
the
humidity,
and
the
barometric
pressure
are
at
the
point
in
the
air
where
the
radiosonde
did.
for
example,
if
the
radiosonde
to
take
temperature,
for
an
illustration,
where
the
height
where
the
temperature
was
-50
degrees
centigrade,
the
radiosonde
might
transmit
the
morse
code
signal
bn.
at
40
degrees,
it
would
transmit
qx.
at
30
degrees,
another
pair
of
letters.
it
was,
therefore,
obviously
of
the
greatest
importance
that
the
machine
be
adjusted
in
a
certain
way
that
the
signal
bn,
which
the
operator
on
the
ground
knew
meant
fif
--
-50
degrees
centigrade,
in
fact
was
transmitted
at
-50
degrees
centigrade.
and,
these
tests
involved
in
the
case
involved
testing
the
radiosondes
for
the
accuracy
of
the
signals
that
they
transmitted
with
respect
to
temperature,
humidity,
and
the
barometric
pressure.
the
charge
was
that
the
test
results
which
were
given
by
the
operators
of
the
testing
devices
to
the
government
were
falsified
and
this,
of
course,
if
true,
would
be
a
violation
of
the
false
statements
act
and
a
conspiracy
to
submit
such
false
information
would
be
a
criminal
conspiracy.
the
defe
--
the
government,
after
the
jury
was
empanelled,
made
a
very
short
opening
statement.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
was
careful
to
explain
that
the
government's
case
fell
into
two
parts.
the
first,
he
said,
would
be
largely
technical
and
he
didn't
need
to
put
it
in
at
all,
but
he
thought
that
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
jury
to
explain
what
a
radiosonde
was
and,
also,
to
explain
the
procedures
for
testing
the
accuracy
of
the
calibration
of
the
transmitting
machines.
so,
he
said
he
would,
first,
call
two
witnesses
who
would
describe
the
technical
aspects
of
the
case.
and
then,
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
would
call
other
witnesses
who
would
actually
describe
the
falsification
of
the
tests.
he
did
not
state
the
exact
number,
but
it's
apparent
that
there
were
a
number
of
witnesses
from
the
plant
who
would
testify
about
the
falsification
of
the
test
and,
indeed,
the
actual
conspiracy.
he
didn't
go
into
detail
about
what
their
testimony
would
be,
then
followed
four
or
five
days
of
trial,
during
which,
two
witnesses
tried
to
explain
radiosondes
and
the
procedure
for
testing.
it's
difficult
to
describe
those
four
or
five
days.
they
were
--
it
was
extremely
long,
extremely
painful.
the
witnesses
turned
out
to
be
rather
inept.
the
judge
repeatedly
interrupted
the
witnesses
and,
i
think,
one
reading
the
record
would
include
that
he
contributed
in
very
large
part
to
the
difficulty.
for
example,
he
was
extremely
precise
in
preventing
witnesses
from
stating
any
conclusion.
he
objected,
for
example,
to
the
witness
saying
that
the
signal
that
came
at
-50
degrees
centigrade
would
be
bn.
the
witness
must
say
that
the
signal
would
be
dit-dit-da-da
da-da-dit-dit
so
that
he
wouldn't
be
stating
a
conclusion.
at
another
point,
the
witness,
describing
how
the
radiosonde
was
put
into
a
chamber
where
the
atmospheric
conditions
which
it
would
experience
could
be
simulated,
the
judge
objected
to
the
use
of
the
word
“chamber”
because
he
said
it
might
refer
to
his
offices
or
it
might
refer
to
a
chamber
pot
and
the
word
“chamber”
was,
therefore,
an
improper
one.
he
objected
to
the
use
of
the
word
“gave,”
one
witness
--
one
man
in
the
plant
gave
a
radiosonde
or
some
other
part
to
another
man
in
the
plant,
because
he
said
“that's
a
legal
conclusion
and
you
can't
embody
any
legal
conclusions
in
your
testimony.
you
must
say
he
handed
it
to
him.”
well,
after
some
days
of
this,
the
witnesses
not
unnaturally,
began
to
become
tense
and
i
make
no
assertion
that
they
did
not
say
many
inconsistent
things.
whether
the
inconsistencies
were
serious
or
not
is
a
matter
of
dispute
or
a
matter
of
judgment,
sir.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
described
what
had
happened
in
this
fashion.
i'm
looking
at
page
50
and
51
of
the
record.
“the
testimony
of
the
two
principal
witnesses,
to
whom
we
have
specifically
referred,
were
certainly
confused
and
conflicted.
it
is
clear
from
the
record
before
us
that
the
confusion
and
conflicts
in
these
witnesses'
testimony
was
due
in
no
minor
part
to
the
judge's
persistent,
sharp,
and
sometimes
caustic
cross-examination
through
their
direct
examination.”
and
then,
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me,
over
on
page
53,
right
near
the
top.
this
record
provides
a
prime
example
of
the
consequences
of
overzealous
participation
in
the
examination
of
witnesses
by
the
trial
judge.
it
is
clear
that
the
judge's
sharp
persistent
and
almost
badgering
question
and
caustic
remarks
first
made
the
witnesses
weary
and
overcautious
and
then
confused
them
into
inconsistencies
and,
in
addition,
disrupted
the
orderly
presentation
of
the
government's
case.
i
think
that
i
will
leave
the
point
about
the
conduct
of
the
trial
there
with
simply
one
observation.
when
one
recalls
that
this
is
a
small
circuit
and
that
the
judge
at
the
trial,
he's
an
extraordinarily
able
man,
a
judge
of
15
years
experience,
for
the
senior
circuit
judge
to
administer
that
review,
which
must
have
cost
him
great
personal
distress,
is
i
think
the
best
evidence
of
the
provocation
to
which
he
was
put
and
of
the
manner
in
which
these
five
days
of
trial
had
been
conducted.
after
the
first
four
or
five
days,
the
district
judge
excused
the
jury,
turned
apparently
to
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
and
said
that
there
are
many
kinds
of
character
in
life
and
one
of
the
important
kinds
of
character
is
the
ability
to
recognize
that
he
has
no
case
and
the
willingness
or
courage
to
dismiss
his
case
when
that
becomes
evident.
and,
he
then
commented
on
the
unreliability
of
these
two
technical
witnesses
and
allowed
the
prosecution
15
minutes
to
decide
whether
to
drop
its
case.
at
that
point,
the
united
states
attorney,
himself,
came
into
the
courtroom
and
there
was
a
colloquy
between
the
judge
and
the
united
states
attorney
and
his
assistant
which
appears
at
page
362
of
the
record.
the
judge
had
already
stated
again,
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states
attorney,
why
he
thought
that
the
witnesses
were
unreliable.
he
referred
particularly
to
this
use
of
the
word
“superiors”
which
was
certainly
an
extraordinary
malapropism
but,
if
one
reads
that
part
of
the
record,
he
will
find
that
the
witness
was
describing
a
standard
testing
procedure
and
not
what
anyone
had
done,
and
that
there
was,
i
think,
no
possibility
that
this
was
a
deliberate
effort
to
prejudice
the
case.
he
was
just
a
technically
educated
man,
ignorant
of
the
english
language.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
had--
i'm
sorry.
i
confused
your
honor.
i
went
back.
i
was
coming
to
362
and
was
attempting
to
summarize
something
that
had
preceded
it.
the
other
thing
which
preceded
it,
the
judge
said,
as
an
illustration
of
the
witnesses'
misuse
of
words,
that
in
describing
the
method
of
measuring
humidity,
which
is
most
accurately
measured
by
the
use
of
hair,
that
when
the
witness
had
said
he
knew
only
about
hair,
that
it
must
be
virgin
hair,
as
one
would
speak
of
virgin
timber
or
virgin
wool
or
virgin
sulfur,
the
judge
had
engaged
in
a
colloquy
which
i
think
need
not
be
repeated
but,
obviously,
was
of
color
humor.
having
referred
back
to
these
incidents,
the
judge
then
said
that
no
jury
would
bring
in
a
verdict
against
the
defendant.
and,
mr.
richardson
said
“i
think,
in
the
first
place,
we
should
make
it
clear
that
this
witness
was
called
for
a
limited
purpose,
not
central
to
establishment
that
wrongdoing
had
occur,”
and
he
went
on
to
say
he
understood
he
was
explaining
the
nature
of
the
test.
the
government
would
rely
entirely
on
other
witnesses
to
show
that
the
test
were
not
carried
out
and,
in
fact,
were
falsified.
we
believe,
therefore,
whatever
the
jury's
impression
of
this
witness
generally,
this
judgment
as
to
whether
the
defendants
were
guilty
would
and
should
rest
upon
the
testimony
of
witnesses
who
will
testify
that,
under
the
instructions
of
the
defendants,
they
did
not
follow
the
procedures
prescribed
and
that
they,
in
fact,
falsified
those
procedures.
then,
mr.
caner,
the
assistant,
explained
over
on
the
next
page
“the
court
has
not
heard
one-tenth
of
the
testimony
in
this
case
and
none
of
the
fraud
testimony.”
after
that
colloquy,
the
judge
said
that
he
would
allow
the
case
to
go
on.
then,
the
witness,
robert
rosenholm,
was
called
and
he
was
to
be
a
witness
and
he
was
a
witness
until
the
actual
falsification
of
these
tests.
for
example,
one
of
the
tests
was
to
discover
whether
the
mechanism
had
been
manufactured
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
survive
this
shot
when
the
parachute
opened
and
stopped
its
decent,
and
it
would
be
--
the
radiosonde
would
be
subjected
to
a
similar
shot.
what
was
done,
according
to
the
witness,
was
that
the
radiosonde
would
be
put
into
the
testing
device
that
simulated
the
conditions
it
would
experience.
it
would
be
made
to
broadcast.
the
results
would
be
recorded
on
a
tape
and,
if
they
were
accurate,
well
and
good.
then,
what
should
have
taken
place
would
be
that
the
shot
would
be
administered
to
the
device.
it
would
be
put
back
in
the
gadget
and
a
second
tape
would
be
made
showing
how
accurately
it
recorded
after
the
shot.
but,
what
witness
said
was
done
in
the
plant
was
that
two
tapes
were
made
before
the
shot
and
that,
then,
one
tape
was
made
after
the
shot
and
that
the
tapes
given
to
the
government
inspector,
who
was
charged
with
determining
whether
the
devices
were
accurate,
would
be
the
two
tapes
before
the
shot
and
one
would
be
represented
to
be
a
post-shot
tape.
another
part
of
his
testimony
concerned
the
making
of
what
i
think
i
could
call
false
tapes.
one
was
suppose
to
record
what
signals
the
radiosonde
actually
emitted.
if
one
know
that,
at
-50
degrees
centigrade,
it
was
supposed
to
emit
the
signal
bn
and
the
signal
pt
came
instead,
why,
he
could
record
bn
on
the
tape,
gives
the
tape
to
the
government
inspector
and,
thereby,
mislead
him.
rosenholm
also
testified
that
this
was
done
and
he
was
describing
in
some
detail
exactly
how
the
test
was
administered
and
the
false
information
was
given
to
the
operator.
he
said
that
the
false
information
was
on
a
car
and
then,
after
what
i
recall
to
be
about
two
pages
of
the
record,
he
said,
“no,
wait
a
minute.
i
see
where
i
went
wrong
now.
it
wasn't
on
a
card.
the
card
stayed
with
the
radiosonde
all
the
time.
i
would
go
to
the
file
and
get
the
information
and
give
it
to
the
operator
who
was
falsifying
the
test.”
so,
there
was,
in
the
sense,
an
inconsistency
but
it
was
also
an
inconsistency
that
the
witness,
himself,
called
attention
to
and
said,
“no,
i
was
wrong,”
and
it
came
after
a
good
deal
of
this
badgering
inspector.
the
witness
then
went
on
to
deal
with
the
alleged
conspiracy.
he
testified
that
a
time
had
come
when
he
went
to
an
office
in
north
dayton,
the
town
near
the
plant,
where
a
company
lawyer
was
present
and
that
various
other
employees
were
there.
the
question
then
that
came
up,
as
it
obviously
might,
about
the
admissibility
of
this
testimony,
which
we're
not
concerned
with.
and,
he
was
asked
--
well,
excuse
me
just
a
minute.
what
he
was
going
to
testify
to,
as
nearly
everyone
knew,
was
that,
at
that
meeting,
the
company
lawyer
and
responsible
company
officials
had
had
this
falsification
called
to
their
attention
and
that
they
had
determined
that
it
should
continue.
so,
this
was
an
essential
part
of
the
alleged
conspiracy.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
what
he
was
going
to
testify
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
my
impression
from
the
record
is
that
judge
wyzanski
had
learned
this,
too,
yes.
so,
that
since
it
was
alleged
that
the
conspiracy
ran
until
november
1957,
it
was
important
to
the
prosecution
to
admit
as
to
--
the
meeting
was
some
time
before
november
1957.
the
witness
was
asked
before
he
gave
this
testimony,
mr.
justice
brennan,
on
page
552
of
the
record,
“did
you
have
a
discussion
with
him?”
“yes,
sir.”
“approximately
when
did
you
have
the
discussion?”
witness:
“i
am
not
sure.”
the
court:
“can't
you
tell
us
whether
it
was
1958
or
--
“witness:
“it
was
1958.”
“can't
you
tell
us,
on
reflection,
whether
it
was
hot
weather
or
cold
weather?”
“i
believe
it
was
in
the
month
of
february,
but
i'm
not
sure.”
the
point
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
is
that
the
witness
had
never
been
very
precise,
that
a
very
suggestive
question
had
been
put
to
him
by
the
judge
because
if
you
say
“was
it
1958
or
--”
it
suggest
1959,
and
if
you
don't
know
whether
it's
1957
or
1958,
the
judge
thought
1958
is
the
earliest
possible
date,
and
a
not
too
strong
a
witness
might
easily
fall
in
with
it.
shortly
later,
there
was
a
recess
for
the
evening
and,
the
next
morning,
i
turn
now
to
page
559,
the
assistant
united
states
mr.
--
attorney,
mr.
caner,
asked
his
first
question.
he
said
“yesterday,
mr.
rosenholm,
you
said
you
believed,
at
the
time
you
were
called
by
mr.hester
to
his
office
and
introduced
to
mr.
tykelan,
it
was
february
1958.
are
you
sure
of
that
date?”
answer:
“no,
sir.”
“what
is
your
best
recollection
of
what
occurred
--
of
when
that
occurred?”
witness:
“approximately,
september
1957.”
then,
mr.
caner
sought
to
approach
the
bench.
one
could
only
infer
that
his
purpose
was
to
explain
what
had
taken
place
overnight,
but
the
judge
said,
“you
don't
have
to
approach
the
bench.
that
requires
no
explanation.
it
isn't
in
a
criminal
case
correct.”
apparently,
meaning
that
it
had
been
incorrect
for
mr.
caner
to
have
said
anything
to
the
witness.
now,
that
is
sheer
inference
on
my
part.
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
“it”
means,
but
we
do
know
that
it
came
out
somewhat
later
during
cross-examination,
when
of
course
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
made
a
great
issue
of
this
change
of
date
very
skillfully
and,
certainly,
with
all
propriety,
that
mr.
caner
had
spoken
to
the
witness
and
that
the
witness
had
changed
his
testimony
after
talking
to
mr.
caner.
now,
this
appears
on
page
567
and
i
think
that
it,
too,
is
worth
calling
to
your
attention.

down
--
two-thirds
the
way
down
the
page,
“when
you
testified
yesterday
to
february
1958,
you
believed
you
were
telling
the
truth,
didn't
you?”
“yes.”
“you
had
every
intention
to
tell
the
truth,
didn't
you?”
“but,
you
came
here
this
morning
and
now
say
it
was

court:“1957?”
mr.
st.
clair,
he
was
counsel
for
defendants:
“that
is
right.”
“instead
of
february
1958?”
“that
is
right.”
and
then,
they
go
on
--
no,
i
must
read
at
the
very
--
“and
any
conversation
you
had
by
february
of
1958
would
be
entirely
meaningless,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
don't
you?
you
know
that,
don't
you?”
“of
that,
i
don't
know.”
“weren't
you
told
that
in
substance?”
“by
whom?”
“by
anybody.”
witness:
“i
don't
recall
whether
anybody
told
me
this.”
remember
that
a
purist
has
been
keeping
after
him
for
some
time
now.
he
doesn't
recall
whether
anybody
even
told
him.
“you
don't
recall
that
even
though
it
happened
this
morning?”
that
he
was
told
this
date
would
be
meaningless
may
have
happened
that
morning,
for
all
we
know.
the
court:
“you
are
being
asked
about
a
conversation
which
must
have
taken
place
within
the
last
hour-and-a
half.”
“not
necessarily.”
“were
you
ask
--
told
by
anybody,
not
necessarily
had
been
an
hour-and-a
half?”
the
witness:
“yes.
i
agreed
to
the
fact
that
mr.
caner
questioned
me,
your
honor,
and
that
i
had
changed
the
date
this
morning.”
there
was
no
attempt
on
his
part
to
conceal
anything.
now,
what
had
happened,
as
it
comes
out
in
the
later
colloquy,
was
that
mr.
caner
had
shown
him
during
the
interval
a
statement
that
he
had
given
to
the
fbi
and
had
asked
him
whether
this
refreshed
his
recollection
as
to
the
date,
and
the
witness
had
said,
yes,
he
must
have
been
wrong
on
the
stand
yesterday.
at
this
stage,
the
judge
put
an
end
to
the
trial.
he,
first,
rebuked
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
for
speaking
to
a
witness.
he
exonerated
him
of
any
intention
to
do
wrong,
but
charged
him
with
highly
improper
conduct
and
he,
then,
said
to
the
counsel
for
the
defendants
that
he
was
prepared
to
respond
to
a
motion.
at
that
stage,
counsel
for
the
defendants
moved
for
a
directed
verdict.
i
emphasize
that
this
was
on
their
motion
and
not
on
the
judge's
own
initiative.
and,
the
judge
called
the
jury
back
and
explained,
referring
both
to
the
ineptness
of
the
witnesses
and
the
misconduct
as
he
sought
of
counsel,
that
the
trial
--
that
he
was
putting
an
end
to
the
trial
and
that
he
was
directing
them
to
return
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
didn't
mean
to
use
--
if
i
used
the
word
“initiation,”
it
was
an
unfair
slip
of
the
tongue.
the
court
indicated
that
it
was
prepared
to
take
some
action.
what
i
meant
to
emphasize
was
that
the
defendants
did
move
for
an
acquittal.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
natural
response
but,
sometimes,
an
attorney
has
the
duty
to
disagree
with
the
court
and,
if
the
defendants
here
wanted
this
trial
to
go
forward
and
thought
it
was
to
the
advantage
of
their
client,
then
it
was
certainly
within
their
power
and
i
would've
thought
entirely
proper,
indeed,
their
duty
to
have
said
“your
honor,
we
want
to
be
tried
here
and
now.
we
don't
want
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
they
--
this
would
depend
of
course,
if
they
thought
it
through,
upon
their
speculation
about
the
effects
of
the
acquittal.
if
they
knew,
as
i
hope
to
show
the
court,
that
the
order
that
was
entered
would
simply
be
a
usurpation
of
non-judicial
power
then,
perhaps,
they
wouldn't
have
wanted
it
entered
because
this
trial
had,
from
their
point
of
view,
been
going
very
well.
i
do
submit,
your
honor,
but
i
think
this
is
the
nub
of
it,
this
is
not
simply
a
case
where
the
judge
has
terminated
the
trial
without
the
consent
or
over
the
objection
or
without
any
participation
by
the
defendants.
it
is
a
case
where
the
defendant
moved
for
the
judge
to
take
what
we
believe
was
a
non-judicial
function
to
enter
a
non-judicial
order,
one
utterly
beyond
his
power.
the
case
went
from
there
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
on
mandamus.
the
court
of
appeals
was
unanimous
in
the
view
that
the
united
states
attorney
had
engaged
in
no
misconduct
and,
i
take
it,
there's
really
no
basis
for
any
suggestion
contrary
to
the
court's
ruling
on
that
point.
the
court
was
also
unanimous
that
the
order
entered
by
the
district
judge
was
a
nullity
because
it
was
beyond
his
power.
there
was
a
difference
between
the
judges
in
their
reasoning.
chief
judge
woodbury,
speaking
for
the
majority,
said
that
the
district
judge
would
have
had
no
power
to
enter
this
order
of
acquittal
at
this
stage
in
the
case,
whether
he
did
it
because
of
some
assumed
inadequacy
in
the
government's
evidence
or
whether
he
did
it
because
of
the
misconduct
of
counsel.
judge
aldrich
agreed
that
there
was
no
power
to
direct
a
verdict
of
acquittal
because
of
the
misconduct
of
counsel
but
he
thought
that
there
would've
been
power
if
it
had
been
done
because
of
inadequacies
in
the
evidence.
this
forced
him
naturally
to
consider
what
was
the
reason
which
the
judge
--
for
which
the
judge
acted.
he
concluded
that
it
was
not
done
because
of
inadequacies
of
the
evidence,
that
it
was
done
simply
because
counsel
had
engaged
in
what
the
judge
thought
to
be
misconduct
and
he
concluded
that
the
order
was
a
nullity
because
the
judge
has
no
power
to
direct
a
verdict
of
acquittal
for
that
reason.
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
we
think
the
court
below
was
undeniably
right
in
holding
that
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
was
not
guilty
of
misconduct
and
that
the
criticism
of
the
district
judge
was
an
extraordinary
aberration.
i'm
certain,
too,
that
after
studying
the
record,
this
court
will
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
any
deficiencies
in
the
prosecution's
case
were
largely
the
result
of
the
confusion
created
by
the
district
judge.
whether
the
district
judge
was
right
or
wrong
in
these
respects,
however,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
largely
immaterial
at
this
stage
in
the
case.
for
our
case
necessarily
shows,
necessarily
depends
upon
showing,
not
merely
that
he
was
wrong
but
that,
even
if
he
were
right,
he
would've
had
no
power
under
these
circumstances
to
direct
the
verdict
of
acquittal.
but,
i'm
speaking
of
a
lack
of
power
in
the
very
stricter
sense
just
as
the
court
has
no
power
to
forbid
a
grand
jury
to
consider
a
particular
offense
or
no
power
to
refuse
to
issue
a
bench
warrant
after
the
grand
jury
has
returned
a
valid
indictment.
so,
here,
we
submit
that
the
district
judge
had
no
power
to
enter
this
order
of
acquittal.
to
illustrate
the
point,
i
refer
back
to
the
illustration
i
used
toward
the
opening
of
my
argument
as
a
judge
--
to
the
case
of
the
judge
who
had
no
power
to
return
a
finding
of
guilty
because
he
had
not
heard
testimony.
the
petitioners
here
assert
that
the
power
of
a
trial
judge
to
acquit
defendants
who
are
properly
before
him
is
absolute.
much
of
their
case
and,
as
i
--
indeed,
as
i
understood
mr.
richenthal,
depend
--
indeed,
all
their
cases,
as
i
understood
mr.
richenthal,
depends
upon
this
proposition
which
we
think
both
reason
and
authority
show
to
be
in
defensive.
we
deny
that
a
district
court
has
any
such
absolute
power.
in
the
first
place,
the
proposition
advanced
by
the
petitioners
is
inconsistent
with
the
fundamental
constitutional
division
of
functions
between
the
executive
and
judicial
branches.
the
judicial
branch
has
no
power
to
determine
what
crimes
shall
be
investigated
or
what
indictments
shall
be
tried.
where
prosecution
upon
an
information
is
permissible,
that's
the
responsibility
of
the
united
states
attorney.
where
prosecution
must
be
by
indictment,
it
is
up
to
the
united
states
attorney
to
determine
what
crimes
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
grand
jury
or
the
grand
jury
may
conduct
an
investigation
of
its
own.
but,
in
either
event,
it's
none
of
the
concern
of
the
district
court,
or
of
any
other
court.
for
the
court
to
interfere
in
any
of
those
cases
would
be
a
plain
usurpation
of
non-judicial
power.
similarly,
a
judge
cannot
nolle
pros
an
indictment
or,
as
i've
mentioned
earlier,
refuse
to
issue
a
bench
warrant.
the
judge
who
refuses
to
permit
a
trial
in
the
prosecution's
evidence,
we
say,
exceeds
the
judicial
function
just
as
much
as,
if
after
the
case
were
in,
he
were
to
try
to
issue
a
pardon
and
his
order
is
equally
void.
that
fundamental
division
of
power
has
been
fully
recognized,
i
think,
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
for
example,
in
ex
parte
united
states,
in
242
united
states,
the
question
was
whether
a
district
court
had
the
power
to
suspend
sentence,
the
inherent
power,
because
the
case
arose
before
the
statutes
conferred
that
power
in
the
court.
the
decision
upon
mandamus
was
that
the
attempted
exercise
of
such
power
was
void.
in
the
course
of
the
reasoning
by
chief
justice
white,
he
expressed
this
fundamental
division
to
which
i've
been
trying
to
call
attention.
he
said
“if
it
be
that
the
plain
legislative
command
fixing
a
specific
punishment
for
crime
is
subject
to
be
permanently
set
aside
by
an
implied
judicial
power
upon
considerations
extraneous
to
the
legality
of
the
conviction,
it
would
seem
necessarily
to
follow
that
it
could
likewise
be
implied
a
discretionary
authority
to
permanently
refuse
to
try
a
criminal
charge
because
of
the
conclusion
that
a
particular
act
made
criminal
by
law
ought
not
to
be
treated
as
criminal.
and,
thus,
it
would
come
to
past
that
the
possession
by
the
judicial
department
of
the
power
to
permanently
refuse
to
enforce
a
law
would
result
in
the
destruction
of
conceded
powers
of
other
departments
and,
hence,
leave
no
law
to
be
enforced.
so,
he
suggested
the
exercise
that
this
power
to
decide
what
crime
should
be
prosecuted
simply
did
not
belong
to
the
judicial
branch.
the
same
point
came
before
the
court,
a
number
of
years
later,
in
ex
parte
united
states,
in
287
united
states,
where
a
district
judge
had
refused
to
issue
a
bench
warrant
after
the
grand
jury
had
returned
a
valid
indictment
and,
thus,
refused
to
bring
the
defendant
to
the
bar
for
trial
and
the
court
held,
again
on
mandamus,
that
that
was
an
abuse
by
the
district
judge.
that
it
had
no
discretion
to
refuse
to
issue
a
bench
warrant
because
it
would
have
no
discretion
to
bar
a
trial.
thus,
again
indicating
what
the
proper
division
of
functions
is.
i
think
the
case
could
be
tested
by
an
example
which
is
not
in
the
books,
it
seems
to
me,
to
follow
from
those
precedence,
just
like
today.
suppose
that,
as
soon
as
the
jury
were
empanelled
in
a
criminal
case,
the
judge
should
say,
“i
don't
think
this
man
should
be
prosecuted.
he's
lived
a
reputable
life.
i
doubt
very
much
that
he
is
guilty
of
crime.
i,
therefore,
direct
a
verdict
of
acquittal.”
we
submit
that
this
simply
would
be
a
nullity.
the
judge
has
no
discretion
to
determine
who
should
be
tried
and
that
the
obvious
flaw
in
that
situation,
the
obvious
excess
of
judicial
power
in
that
situation
fully
demonstrates
that
the
petitioner's
propositions
are
quite
wrong
in
saying
that
anything
called
“an
acquittal”
is
within
the
judge's
power
and
puts
an
absolute
end
to
any
possibility
of
prosecution,
except
for
the
label
which,
surely,
is
not
decisive.
there's
no
difference
between
attempting
to
acquit
a
defendant
before
there's
been
any
trial
and
refusing
to
issue
a
bench
warrant
or
refusing
to
let
the
grand
jury
return
an
indictment
or
entering
a
nolle
pros
over
the
objection
of
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
quite.
my
proposition
is
that
there
is
no
power
to
direct
a
verdict
of
acquittal
until
the
court
has
granted
the
government
a
hearing.
now,
we
--
i
direct
myself
to
the
point
raised
by
your
question.
we
do
recognize,
of
course,
that
it
is
part
of
the
trial
judge's
function
to
determine
whether
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
and
that
the
court
may
direct
an
acquittal,
that
it
has
power
to
direct
an
acquittal
at
that
stage
no
matter
how
misguided
its
judgment
of
the
evidence
may
be.
what
we
do
say,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
that
the
judge
has
power
to
acquit
a
defendant
after
he
has
heard
the
evidence,
after
he
has
granted
a
hearing.
even
so,
his
order
is
erroneous,
but
that
there's
a
fundamental
distinction
between
passing
judgment
upon
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
after
a
hearing,
and
simply
saying
at
the
beginning
“i
won't
let
this
case
go
forward.”
the
one
is
a
judicial
function,
the
other
isn't.
mr.
archibald
cox
what
do
i
mean
by
a
hearing?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
mean
after
learning
what
the
government's
case
is.
mr.
archibald
cox
normally,
that
would
come,
after
hearing
the
government's
evidence
but
i
do
not
assert
that
that
is
the
only
time
at
which
a
verdict
of
acquittal
may
be
entered.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
there
are
a
number
of
other
points
at
which
the
power
to
direct
an
acquittal
arises.
for
example,
the
power
to
direct
an
acquittal
because
of
a
defect
in
the
indictment
which
is
unquestionably
within
the
power
of
a
district
judge,
it
was
the
wiseman
case.
even
so,
he
shouldn't
do
it.
he
--
still,
he
has
the
power
to
do
it
and
it
is
done.
that
may,
of
course,
be
done
at
any
stage
of
the
case.
again,
if
the
prosecution
has
made
an
opening
statement
which
reveals
what
the
testimony
is
and
the
judge
says,
“well,
all
you
propose
to
prove
still
wouldn't
be
a
crime,”
then,
an
acquittal
may
be
entered.
again,
i
think
that,
partway
through
the
course
of
the
case,
the
fundamental
defect
in
the
government's
case
may
appear.
let
me
suppose,
for
example,
a
prosecution
for
transmitting
a
stolen
automobile
across
state
lines,
a
violation
of
the
dyer
act.
let
us
suppose
that
the
--
in
its
opening
statement,
the
united
states
attorney
said,
“i'm,
first,
going
to
prove
that
this
automobile
was
stolen
and
then,
second,
i'm
going
to
prove
how
it
was
transported
across
state
lines.”
and,
he
calls
a
witness
to
testify
that
the
automobile
was
stolen
and
the
witness
ends
up
with
a
self-contradictory
evasive
statement
that
maybe
he
gave
to
the
defendant,
and
that's
all
that
there
is.
and,
the
judge
says,
“well,
that's
the
best
you
could
do
on
this
critical
issue.
there's
no
point
in
our
sitting
here
and
trying
whether
it
was
taken
across
state
lines.”
but,
the
government
had
been
given
its
chance
to
go
forward
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
and
it
failed.
now,
still,
an
additional
illustration
would
be
if
a
fundamental
--
if
some
indisputable
defense
appeared
in
the
course
of
the
government's
testimony.
at
that
stage,
my
point
is
that
the
judge
must
learn
what
the
government
can
do
and,
if
he
doesn't
learn
what
the
government
can
do,
then
he
is
not
exercising
judicial
power
because
the
whole
notion
of
the
trial
presupposes
that
what
will
act
upon
the
basis
of
information
before
it
and
not,
if
he
attempts
to
do
something
else,
he
is
exercising
this
discretionary
power,
which
i
think
the
citation
show
does
not
exist.
now,
in
this
case,
the
trial
had
gone
on
for
several
days,
but
the
judge's
action
did
not
differ
in
any
substantial
respect
from
the
entry
of
a
verdict
of
acquittal
immediately
after
the
jury
was
empanelled
and
before
the
opening
statement.
the
judge
had
been
told
that
the
prosecution
would
divide
its
case
into
two
parts
and
it
would
only
just
barely
embark
upon
the
essential
part
of
the
case.
indeed,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
jury
could
convict
on
whether
the
jury
understood
the
witnesses
about
radiosondes
or
not
or
about
these
tests
or
not.
after
all,
if
there
were
a
number
of
witnesses
who
described
this
conspiracy
and
fixed
the
date,
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
they
understood
the
test,
as
long
as
they
knew
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
falsify
the
test.
the
witnesses
on
the
conspiracy
had
simply
not
been
heard
with
the
exception
of
the
testimony
that
rosenholm
had
given.
here,
again
i
think
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
careful
opinion
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
describes
the
situation
very
well.
the
district
judge,
judge
woodbury,
said
sharply
termi
--
abruptly
terminated
the
government's
case
long
before
the
government
had
an
opportunity
to
show
whether
or
not
it
had
a
case
and,
moreover,
he
did
so
in
ignorance
of
either
the
exact
nature
or
cogency
of
the
specific
evidence
of
guilt,
which
government's
counsel
said
he
had
available
and
was
ready
to
present.
we
think
it
follows,
therefore,
that
the
order
cannot
possibly
be
sustained
as
an
exercise
of
the
power
to
acquit
for
insufficiency
of
evidence.
the
court
lacked
the
power
because
it
had
not
heard
or
even
learned
about
the
evidence
and
this
depends,
i
emphasize
again,
not
upon
the
chronological
point
of
the
trial
or
any
mechanical
measure
but
on
whether
the
government
has
been
given
the
substance
of
a
hearing,
either
through
the
opportunity
to
paraphrase
what
the
witnesses
would
say
or
through
the
opportunity
to
put
the
witnesses
on
the
stand.
the
alternative
question,
which
is
necessary
for
me
to
consider,
is
whether
there
is
power
to
acquit
because
of
a
misconduct
of
the
prosecutor.
i'll
cover
that
very
quickly.
a
district
judge
has
a
wide
variety
of
measures
with
which
to
deal
with
misconduct,
may
censure
the
attorney
or
take
disciplinary
action
against
him
if
it
finds
that
the
misconduct
has
somehow
influenced
the
--
unfairly
influenced
the
trial.
of
course,
it
may
declare
a
mistrial.
if
it
finds
that
the
government's
conduct
is
so
unfair
that
a
fair
trial
could
not
be
held
in
the
district
in
the
future,
then,
no
doubt,
it
has
authority
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
but,
it
has
no
power
--
no
more
power
to
punish
the
prosecutors,
i
submit,
by
acquitting
the
defendant
than
there
is
to
punish
the
defendant's
lawyers
by
convicting
the
defendant.
as
was
stated
in
mcguire
against
the
united
states,
a
criminal
prosecution
is
more
than
a
game
in
which
the
government
may
be
checkmated
and
the
game
lost
merely
because
the
officers
have
not
played
according
to
rule.
and,
we
conclude
here
that
judge
had
done
either
possible
basis,
the
order
was
a
nullity.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
judge
had
heard
--
mr.
archibald
cox
all
the
evidence,
then
i
think
that
it
would
be
implicit
that
he
had
acted
on
the
evidence,
that
he
had
found
the
government
didn't
have
a
case
and,
no
matter
how
outrageous
the
decision
that
the
government
didn't
have
a
case
might
be,
that
we
would
be
bound
by
it,
that
he
would
have
granted
us
a
hearing,
that
he
would
have
exercised
the
judicial
power
of
attempting
to
decide
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
no
matter
how
wrong
he
was,
he
would've
exercised
a
judicial
function
and
the
acquittal
would
be
binding.
we
could
not
obtain
mandamus.
there
could
not
be
a
second
trial.
mr.
archibald
cox
solely
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that's
about
the
hardest
case,
i
think,
your
honor.
it
isn't
our
case,
i
suggest.
the
difficulty
i
have
with
it
is
that,
frankly,
i
am
troubled
about
saying
that
the
appellate
court,
on
mandamus,
may
inquire
into
the
motivation
of
the
judge
at
that
stage
in
the
trial
in
attempt
to
disentangle
the
possible
reasons
he
might
have
given.
now,
in
the
case
you've
posed,
the
fact
is
acknowledged
and
i
think
i
would
say
that
if
he
purpo
--
that
if
he
announces
that
he
is
exercising
this
non-existent
power,
then
the
stage
to
which
the
trial
has
progressed
makes
no
difference,
but
i
don't
think
i
have
to
argue
here
and,
candidly,
i
would
be
very
reluctant
to
argue
that,
in
a
case
where
the
assertion
of
non-existent
power
wasn't
acknowledged
by
the
judge,
wasn't
manifest,
that
we
had
the
right
to
inquire
into
it.
i
don't
believe
we
do.
as
i
say,
certainly,
i
don't
have
to
argue
any
such
case
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would've
agreed
with
judge
--
first,
i
think
that
judge
aldrich
is
right
in
attributing
--
in
saying
that
the
judge
directed
the
verdict
because
of
his
belief
that
the
prosecutor
had
engaged
in
misconduct.
he
hadn't,
but
i
think
that's
why
the
judge
acted.
second,
i
would
agree
with
judge
woodbury
that
if
the
judge
did
act
because
he
thought
the
evidence
was
insufficient,
that
still
he
went
beyond
his
power
because
he
didn't
--
he
hadn't
heard
the
evidence
in
order
to
judge
whether
it
was
insufficient.
so
that,
i
agree
with
judge
aldrich
up
to
a
point
in
his
analysis
in
the
judge's
action,
but
i
say
that
we
don't
need
to
go
into
that
question
because
i
don't
think
the
judge
had
the
power
in
either
event.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
afraid
i
don't
quite
understand,
your
honor,
because
if
he
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
point
i
was
trying
to
suggest
to
the
court
was
that
it
was
necessary
to
give
to
engage
in
any
disentangling
if
neither
ground
would
be
a
sufficient
ground
for
the
acquittal.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
only
point
on
which
i
agree
with
judge
aldrich
is
on
the
decision
of
the
point
which
i
assert
is
unimportant,
but
i
wanted
to
give
the
chief
justice
my
analysis
of
that
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
can
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
we're
in
complete
agreement
but,
somehow,
we
started
around
the
circle
at
a
different
point,
but
i
don't
disagree
with
anything
your
honor
has
said.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
i
understand
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
not
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but,
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
isolate
it.
i
am
saying
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then,
i
would
say
--
you
mean,
can
one
take
the
position
that
judge
aldrich
took,
logically.
mr.
archibald
cox
isn't
that
what
it
comes
to?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
could
--
mr.
archibald
cox
is
it
proper
to?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
this
is
a
very
hard
question
and
i
think
pro
--
well,
i
don't
like
to
say
that
judge
aldrich
was
wrong
and
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
point.
i
think
my
case
really
depends
on
saying
that,
whatever
was
the
motivation
of
these
two
possible
motivations,
they're
not
--
the
judge
did
not
have
the
power.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
seems
from
his
statement
that
this
was
a
cumulative
thing.
it
was
a
highly
unfortunate
thing
and
it
apparently
been
building
up
for
a
number
of
days.
so
that,
this
was
triggered,
as
mr.
richenthal
said.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
--
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think,
first,
your
honor,
that
if
there
had
not
been
a
number
of,
from
our
standpoint,
provocations
--
provocation
is
the
wrong
word.
if
there
had
not
been
--
the
trial
hadn't
been
handled
as
it
was
with
reference
to
the
united
states
attorney,
i
suspect
i
was
not
in
office
at
the
time,
that
the
government
would've
said,
“well,
this
is
one
of
these
things.
we
can't
let
it
go.”
as
a
matter
of
appellate
law,
i
would
think
that
our
case
was
exactly
the
same
and
we
would
be
defending
it,
yes,
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
really
mean
all
the
connotation
is
that
word.
it
was
the
first
one
that
came
to
my
mind,
but
i
think
you
know
what
i
mean.
the
reasons
we
acted,
the
motives.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
--
as
i
tried
to
say
at
the
outset,
i
think
in
all
candor
that
i
have
to
say
that
even
if
the
judge
was
right,
even
if
the
united
states
attorney
was
guilty
of
misconduct,
and
even
if
the
witnesses
were,
up
to
this
point,
were
as
bad
as
the
judge
said
they
were,
that
still
he
had
no
power
to
do
this
because
if
he
was
merely
wrong,
mandamus
wouldn't
be
a
proper
remedy
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
would
still
be
mere
error
but,
because
what
we
say
essentially
here
is,
one,
a
district
judge
has
no
power
to
acquit
without
a
hearing.
what
we're
pleading
for
essentially
here,
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
is
the
right
of
the
prosecution
to
be
heard.
now,
when
i
say
the
prosecution,
i
don't
mean
the
prosecutors
or
even
the
government
as
an
abstraction.
it's
the
right
of
the
interest
that
are
secured
by
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law,
the
interest
of
public
in
the
security
of
properties,
security
of
persons,
security
of
transactions.
it's
their
right
to
be
heard
and
not
to
be
cut
off
before
they
have
had
a
hearing.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
there
was
one
point
which
i
wasn't
quite
sure
i
understood.
now,
the
judge
makes
this
statement
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
and,
the
prosecution
then
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
has
he
refused
to
allow
it
to
put
on
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'll
exclude.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
presume
that
a
judge
has
the
power
to
--
the
power
to
exclude
individual
bits
of
evidence.
i
would
doubt
that
he
had
the
power
before
he
heard
it
or
learned
what
it
was,
to
say,
“i
won't
receive
any
evidence”
because
that
would
be,
in
substance,
the
very
same
case
as
if
he
directed
an
acquittal.
but,
i
think
he
could've
done
this.
i
think
that,
as
the
prosecutor
called
each
witness,
if
the
defendant
objected,
the
judge
would
have
power
to
rule
on
the
objection
and
no
matter
how
wrong
he
was,
provided
he
was
purporting
to
rule
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
that,
then,
we
could
not
challenge
the
upshot
of
the
trial.
the
point
is
this
--
this
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
ways
in
which
a
judge
who
is
determined
to
prevent
conviction
could
do
it.
he
could,
the
case
that
occurred
to
me,
justice
whittaker,
would
be
the
judge,
when
he
reached
this
point
of
the
trial,
simply
turned
off
his
ear
--
hearing
aid.
he
doesn't
tell
anyone
this
and
that
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
he
says,
“i
don't
think
there's
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury.”
i
suppose
that
that
order
would
stand.
the
protection
in
that,
i
think,
is
this,
that
if
the
judge
directs
his
find
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence,
in
terms
of
admissibility,
that
that
itself
is
a
good
deal
of
protection.
i
can't
imagine
the
district
judge
in
this
case,
no
matter
how
annoyed
he
was
at
the
government
and
no
matter
how
great
this
momentary
aberration,
i
cannot
imagine
this
district
judge
having
excluded
a
palpably
admissible
evidence.
it's
just
a
protection
in
itself
if
he
has
to
before
direct
his
find
to
the
issue.
now,
if
he's
stubborn
enough
or
benignant
enough,
of
course
he
could
accomplish
the
same
result,
but
i
think
we
get
to
--
the
public
gets
the
benefit
of
that
protection.
mr.
archibald
cox
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
the
judge
never
directed
his
mind
to
the
question
whether
there
could
be
a
fair
trial
sometime
in
the
future
here
and
that,
therefore,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
he
would've
had
power
to
prevent
the
case
being
tried
in
the
future
if
he
found
that
there
could
never
be
a
fair
trial
because
of
the
prosecution's
misconduct.
here,
i
think
he
never
put
his
mind
on
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
know,
except
that
there
is
certainly
not
the
slightest
indication
of
it
in
the
record
and
this
is
not
the
kind
of
conduct
which,
if
it
had
been
wrong,
would've
been
thought
to
make
a
fair
judgment.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
always,
certainly,
sir.
second,
if
i
might
just
give
one
other
--
second,
i
would
say
that,
even
under
those
circumstances,
there
is
no
power
to
enter
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
an
acquittal
is
a
finding
on
the
evidence
or
on
the
opening
statement
which
takes
place
as
evidence.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
matter
has
been
researched
by
the
department
and,
i
take
it,
by
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
there
simply
appears
to
have
been
no
case
remotely
like
this,
except
the
case
of
regina
against
middlesex
justices.
but,
there,
i'm
convinced
that
when
your
honors
read
that
opinion
that
you
will
find
that
lord
godard
was
criticizing
the
way
the
register
had
appraised
the
full
depositions
from
the
prosecution
witnesses
that
he
had
learned
entirely
what
the
case
was,
that
he
knew
all
the
evidence
that
the
prosecution
was
going
to
put
in,
and
he
said
it
doesn't
make
the
case.
well,
if
that
had
been
done
here,
i
think
that
we
would
be
out
of
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
my
understanding
that
no
reported
decision
like
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
couldn't
deny
the
possibility.
it
would
seem
to
me
wholly
at
war,
your
honor,
with
the
basic
not
--
two
basic
notions.
one,
the
notion
that,
at
least
in
the
federal
courts,
this
isn't
always
true
in
the
states,
that
the
judge
has
no
power
to
decide
what
cases
shall
be
prosecuted.
some
--
in
some
states,
he
does
and
the
answer
would,
there,
be
different,
but
he
has
no
such
power
in
the
federal
court.
second,
such
action
would
be
wholly
at
odds
with
the
notion
of
a
trial.
if
you
aren't
allowed
to
tell
which
the
case
is,
you
aren't
getting
a
trial
and
i
suggest
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
would
seem
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
seem
to
me
that,
under
ex
parte
united
states,
both
the
case
in
242,
to
which
you
referred,
and
the
one
in
247
that
such
action
could
be
challenged.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
on
that
point,
if
i
--
might
i
take
just
a
minute
to
answer
justice
black
on
this
point?
with
respect
to
the
defense
of
former
jeopardy,
mr.
justice
black,
i
very
briefly
would
say
this.
in
the
first
place,
our
courts
and,
as
your
honor
knows,
from
--
we'll
recall
from
wade
and
hunter,
in
opinions
by
yourself,
have
rejected
the
notion
that
this
is
simply
to
be
a
mechanical
counting
of
the
number
of
times
the
defendant
has
been
put
before
a
jury.
and,
there
are
many
instances
where
some
extraordinary
event
prevents
a
fair
judgment
of
guilt
or
innocence,
but
that
the
defendant
may
be
put
on
trial
a
second
time.
those
extraordinary
events
may
be
the
death
of
the
judge
or
the
illness
or
death
of
a
juror,
the
inability
of
the
jury
to
agree,
the
fortunes
of
war.
now,
our
case
here
really
boils
down
to
say
that
the
assumption
of
this
non-judicial
power,
or
the
attempt
to
exercise
this
non-judicial
power
on
the
part
of
the
presiding
judge,
should
be
treated
in
the
same
way
as
other
extraordinary
non-judicial
events
such
as
the
necessity
of
terminating
a
court-martial
because
of
the
fortunes
of
war
or
terminating
a
trial
because
of
the
illness
of
the
judge
or
the
illness
of
a
juror.
i
could
elaborate
that
at
more
length
but
i
think
that's
essentially
what
the
point
comes
down
to.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
there
is
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
certainly
no
intimation.
i
would
simply
say
that
your
honor
puts
undue
emphasis
upon
the
label
“acquittal.”
the
judge
didn't
acquit
here.
he
may
have
called
it
an
acquittal,
but
this
wasn't
an
acquittal
because,
one,
he
has
no
power
simply
to
acquit
because
he
thinks
the
prosecution
shouldn't
go
forward.
it
wasn't
an
acquittal,
two,
because
there
had
been
no
trial.
and,
we
say
that
this
--
the
label
“acquittal”
has
no
legal
effect.
one
must
look
and
see
what
was
done.
mr.
archibald
cox
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
but,
if
it
had
been
--
mr.
archibald
cox
a
dismissal,
of
course,
it
would
not
be
a
necessary
--
a
dismissal
would
not
necessarily
bar
further
prosecution.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
could've
declared
a
mistrial
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
think
it
was,
in
effect,
a
nullity.
that
it
was
nothing
and
that,
therefore,
there
is
still
an
indictment
waiting
to
be
tried
and
mandamus
is
the
normal
and
proper
remedy
for
requiring
a
court
to
proceed
to
trial
when
it's
failing
to
perform
its
duties.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
want
the
whole
thing
expunged.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
well,
that
would
be
true
if
it
had
been
a
mistrial.
mr.
archibald
cox
had
--
he
was
doing
his
best
to
keep
us
from
trying
it
again.
i
wouldn't
deny
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
we
sub
--
that's
what
--
we
submit
that
words
aren't
that
controlling.
