we'll

chief

earl

mr.
richenthal,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl

mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
don't
quite
understand
you
when
you
say
that
this
came
of
the
initiation
of
the
defendant
and
not
the
court.
i
thought
you
said
the
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
a
rather
natural
response
to
a
judge's
suggestion
of
that
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
want
an
acquittal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
they
want
an
acquittal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
they
had
heard
--
if
the
judge
had
heard
all
the
evidence,
whether
the
majority
below
was
correct
in
its
interpretation
of
his
action
or
whether
to
set
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
judgment
is
correct.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
he
had
said
specifically
that
“i
am
granting
this
motion
to
acquit
solely
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
solely
because
i
believe
that
he's
been--
the
defendant
has
been
treated
unfairly
by
the
prosecution
and
i
wouldn't
ask
any
jury
to
convict
the
man
in
those
circumstances.
therefore,
i
grant
an
acquittal.”
would
that
stand?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
view
do
you
take
of
the
evidence
in
view
that
the
majority
took
--
the
majority
took
the
view
that
the
judge
aldrich
took?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
had
been
a
dismissal,
he
would've
done
it
himself,
wouldn't
he?
here,
he
directed
the
jury
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
exercise
his
power.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
that's
true,
but
you're
talking
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
talking
about
labels
here.
you
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
he
called
it
an
acquittal.
it's,
in
effect,
just
a
dismissal.

justice

richenthal.
