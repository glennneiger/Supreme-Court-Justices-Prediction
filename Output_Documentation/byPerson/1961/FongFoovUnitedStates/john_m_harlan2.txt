justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
judge
wyzanski
had
said,
“i'm
directing
a
judgment
of
acquittal
here
because
i
think
the
prosecutor
misbehaved
himself,
and
the
only
way
of
enforcing
high
standards
upon
the
prosecuting
officials
is
to
dispose
of
cases
where
they
don't
live
up
to
the
standards
as
they
should.”
what
is
your
position
on
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
draw
no
distinction
between
--
between
the
grounds
on
which
judge
aldrich
disagreed
with
the
majority.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
accepting
judge
aldrich's
premises,
for
purposes
of
my
questions,
you
still
say
that
you
are
entitled
to

justice
john
m.

the
constitution
doesn't
say
that

justice
john
m.

that's
a
different
thing
from
saying
an
acquittal
is
an
acquittal,

justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
are
you
reading
from?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
all
of
this
go
on
in
the
presence
of
the
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
arguing
is
that
there's
no
power
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
direct
a
d
--
direct
an
acquittal
until
all
the
government's
evidence
is
in?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
didn't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
didn't
have
the
district
attorney's
alleged
misconduct
in
this
case,
nothing
of
that
kind,
you'd
still
be
defending
this
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals?
