mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
briefly
in
the
roper
case
are
these.
in
1954,
the
government
stored
some
of
its
grain,
surplus
grain
in
the
james
river
fleet
anchorage
aboard
that
liberty
ships.
the
ships
were
inactivated
and
were
acting
as
storage
facilities
for
the
government's
grain.
in
1956,
the
government
sold
some
of
its
grain
to
the
--
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
sold
some
of
its
grain
to
the
continental
grain
company.
as
follow
this
transaction,
the
government
paid
the
continental
grain
company
fees
for
the
unloading
of
its
vessel
at
the
norfolk
grain
pier.
the
harry
lane
was
one
of
these
vessels.
it
was
then
decided
to
unload
this
vessel
at
the
norfolk
grain
pier
and
the
harry
lane
was
towed
from
the
james
river
fleet
anchorage
down
to
james
river
through
navigable
waters
of
the
chesapeake
bay
to
the
port
of
norfolk.
the
universal
modern
method
of
discharging
grain
and
in
fact
loading
grain
is
the
use
of
equipment
known
as
the
“marine
leg”
or
“grain
shoot”.
this
is
automatic
equipment.
the
vessel
is
brought
up
to
the
pier
and
this
equipment
is
lowered
over
into
the
holes
of
the
vessel
and
there
is
an
endless
belt
that
goes
up
this
grain
shoot.
and
if
it
is
unloading
the
vessel,
it
sucks
this
grain
up
into
the
warehouse
and
--
which
is
over
here
on
the
side
of
the
pier.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
yes,
there
are
--
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
--
pictures
in
the
record.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
in
the
original
record,
yes.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
this
equipment
--
at
the
end
of
this
equipment
is
what
is
known
as
the
“detachable
scoop”
or
“plow”.
in
other
words,
it
is
conceivable
that
when
this
grain
shoot
gets
to
the
bottom
of
the
hole
that
it
cannot
get
the
rest
of
the
grain
from
the
four
corners
of
the
hole
up,
so
they
have
a
scoop
there
at
the
end
of
this
grain
shoot
and
which
is
detachable
and
the
man
detaches
this
scoop
and
there
is
machinery
which
holds
this
scoop
towards
the
mouth
of
the
leg
and
he
walks
as
if
he
were
plowing,
pushing
the
grain
to
the
mouth
of
the
leg
and
it
is
sucked
up
into
the
storage
through
the
leg.
that
simply
is
the
method
of
operation.
now,
longshoreman
roper
was
an
employee
of
atlantic
and
gulf
stevedores
which
is
a
stevedoring
company
engaged
solely
in
stevedoring
work.
the
owner
of
the
vessel,
harry
lane,
which
is
the
government,
sold
its
grain
to
the
continental
grain
company
which
owns
the
storage
facilities.
and
the
continental
grain
company
in
turn
got
the
services
of
atlantic
and
gulf
stevedoring
company
to
do
the
unloading
and
roper
was
the
employee
of
the
atlantic
stevedoring
company
longshoreman.
he
went
aboard
the
vessel
and
when
he
was
injured,
he
was
attempting
to
show
others
in
the
hole
of
the
vessel
how
the
--
the
plow
should
operate
and
pushing
towards
this
block.
what
happened
was
there
are
wheels
on
the
end
of
this
scoop,
at
the
mouth
of
this
scoop
around
which
lines
go
to
this
scoop
and
in
pulling
the
machinery,
in
pulling
this
scoop
towards
the
mouth
due
to
a
defective
block
or
actually
due
to
a
defective
strap
on
the
block,
this
thing
broke
and
it
slipped
off
and
hit
roper
in
his
face
as
he
was
walking
on
the
bottom
of
the
hole
or
pushing
the
grain
towards
the
shoot.
we
filed
our
case
and
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
and
proceeded
on
through
proving
and
alleged
in
the
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel
in
line
with
sieracki
and
all
of
the
others
who
came
along
the
latest
(inaudible)
the
crumady
of
this
court.
the
district
court
held
in
that
instance
that
the
vessel
did
not
owe
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
to
longshoreman
roper
because
the
court
held
that
the
vessel
was
not
in
navigation.
although
she
was
performing
everything
that
a
live
ship
was
doing,
she
was
discharged
in
her
cargo
pursuant
to
a
commercial
venture
by
her
owner,
the
united
states.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
she
had
been
“mothballed”
which
means
that
--
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
yes,
they
told
her
by
a
means
of
a
tag
from
the
james
of
anchorage
to
norfolk,
it
does
spread
20
miles.
and
aboard
this
vessel,
the
government
put
a
master
with
licenses
unlimited
and
six
crewmen.
the
government
calls
him
a
riding
to
this
still
seaman
in
our
ample
opinion.
however,
the
master
of
the
vessel,
admitted
in
his
testimony
that
he
had
complete
charge
of
the
vessel
during
the
unloading
operation
and
in
fact
he
even
stated
that
if
the
stevedores
had
attempted
to
do
anything
unsafe
that
he
would
have
stop
the
unloading
operation.
the
district
court,
however,
said
that
this
vessel
was
not
in
navigation
and
consequently,
according
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
west
v.
united
states
that
no
warranty
was
owed
to
anyone.
the
circuit
--
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court
with
chief
--
chief
judge
sobeloff
dissenting.
chief
judge
sobeloff
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
that
this
was
not
“dead
ship”
that
--
that
the
west
decision
of
this
court
in
1959
was
improbably
apply
to
the
factual
situation
here
of
course.
pardon
me.
and
the
west
case,
this
court
held
that
a
vessel
which
--
whose
owner
had
by
a
consent
given
the
vessel
to
the
shipyard
for
a
complete
overhaul
and
repair.
and
it
was
taken
to
shipyard
and
the
shore-based
worker
who
came
aboard
the
vessel
to
--
to
make
it
seaworthy
and
was
entered
as
the
result
thereby
that
the
vessel
owner
did
not
owe
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
because
the
vessel
was
--
with
there
--
was
out
of
navigation.
it
is
our
position
in
this
field,
in
this
case,
that
the
fourth
circuit,
the
majority
in
the
fourth
circuit
misapply,
totally
misapply
the
west
decision
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
indeed,
this
court
pointed
out
in
west
that
the
sieracki
doctrine
holding
that
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
extends
to
shore-based
workers
who
are
performing
the
traditional
duties
of
seamen,
held
that
in
the
west
decision
that
that
was
not
applicable
because
the
vessel
was
out
of
navigation.
now,
our
position
here
is
just
as
the
district
court
said,
while
this
--
the
district
court
had
its
opinion
said,
“this
is
no
“dead
ship”.
she's
a
live
ship.
she's
doing
everything
a
live
ship
does
and
sitting
in
navigable
waters.”
we
come
therefore
to
the
principle
question
here
as
i
would
see
it
--
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
no,
sir,
nothing
had
to
be
done
to
the
vessel.
in
other
words,
the
vessel
was
completely
seaworthy
for
the
voyage
for
which
it
was
intended
to
be
put
on
that
is
it's
a
--
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
no,
sir.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
that's
exactly
all,
sir.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
at
norfolk.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
that
is
all,
sir.
and
--
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
and
take
--
take
the
grain
on
it.
that
--
that
is
all.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
complete
vessel
in
all
detail.
she
is
a
world
war
ii
liberty
ship.
but
that
--
there
was
no
necessity
for
repairs,
not
only
for
preparation
of
the
vessel
to
perform
the
voyage
that
it
performed,
it
was
a
--
it
was
seaworthy
in
all
respect
for
the
voyage.
so
--
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
i
--
i
think,
sir,
that
it's
been
stored,
my
recollection
is,
since
1956,
1956,
yes.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
the
accident
happen
1958.
in
other
words,
the
government
had
brought
this
--
had
filled
this
vessel
up
at
norfolk
with
the
surplus
grain
and
take
this
back.
he
towed
it
back
to
james
river
fleet.
and
then
when
they
sold
that
grain,
then
they
brought
it
back
to
norfolk
for
the
unloading.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
now,
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
that
there
is
too
much
--
i
think
judge
--
chief
judge
sobeloff
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
the
fact
that
this
was
a
vessel
doing
everything
that
any
other
vessel
does
and
that
is
the
completion
of
--
completing
a
voyage
on
a
commercial
venture
for
her
owner
and
was
doing
--
and
was
unloading
its
cargo.
and
roper,
my
client,
was
doing
what
traditionally
a
seaman
does.
and
as
the
court
held
in
sieracki
then
this
person
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
the
other
point
in
the
case
was
the
claim
that
since
this
machinery
was
--
was
attached
to
the
dock
that
--
which
was
performing
the
thing,
the
unloading
operation
that
the
--
that
watches
if
seaworthiness
did
not
cover
such
machinery.
but
this
court
stated
in
west
versus
united
states,
mr.
justice
clark
writing
the
opinion
for
a
unanimous
court
that
the
emphasis
now
should
be
upon
the
focus
--
the
focus
should
be
upon
the
status
of
the
vessel
is
it
in
navigation.
in
west,
here
you
had
a
vessel
in
the
shipyard
pulled
up
on
the
ways.
the
man
was
injured
making
unseaworthy.
and
in
the
roper
case,
you've
got
a
vessel
performing
a
live
function.
so,
we
look
to
the
status
of
the
vessel
to
determine
if
that
vessel
is
seaworthy.
and
if
it
is
determined
that
it
is
seaworthy,
then,
of
course
--
pardon
me,
in
navigation,
if
it's
determined
it
is
navigation,
then
the
sieracki
doctrine,
pope
and
talbot
v.
hawn,
crumady
and
all
of
the
rest
of
the
decisions,
magnificent
decisions
of
this
court
holding
that
this
man
is
entitled
to
the
warranty.
but
the
west
decision
says
also
this
as
we
take
it.
mr.
justice
clark
said
in
west.
we
don't
believe
that
there
should
be
any
job
analysis
for
this
people.
they
show
a
basic
people
that
come
aboard
and
perform
seamen's
duties.
my
point
with
this
court
is
that
by
analogy,
if
--
if
west
held
that
there
should
be
no
job
analysis
neither
should
there
be
a
gear
and
equipment
analysis.
what
difference
does
it
make?
isn't
--
isn't
it
really
immaterial
that
one
handle
this
equipment
should
be
on
a
dock,
it
is
doing
the
same
thing.
the
unloading
operation
which
a
longshoreman
would
be
doing
with
a
shovel
in
the
hole
or
standing
on
the
dock
and
shoveling
the
grain
into
a
pile
on
the
dock,
we
see
no
difference.
and
what
difference
would
it
make
also
between
that
and
the
line
which
is
attached
to
the
dock?
so
we
think
that
the
emphasis
since
west
had
shifted,
the
emphasis
had
shifted
to
the
status
not
only
to
the
vessel
but
the
status
of
the
equipment.
and
if
the
equipment
is
being
used
in
a
practical
and
reasonable
relationship
to
the
maritime
service
to
the
vessel,
why
should
this
court
or
any
other
court
go
into
any
analysis
of
the
type
of
equipment?
is
it
grain
unloading
equipment?
is
it
a
dolly
that
you
have?
is
it
a
--
a
block
and
tackle?
as
we
do,
the
petterson
decision
also,
the
earlier
decision
of
this
court,
in
which
this
court
said,
“it
makes
no
difference
who
owns
that
equipment.”
if
that
equipment
is
brought
aboard,
the
vessel
and
its
used
to
the
maritime
service
of
the
vessel,
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
that
case
and
it
was
affirmed
by
this
court
that
the
warranty
was
owed
to
petterson
was
injured
as
a
result
thereby.
so,
our
view
is
that
the
majority
in
the
fourth
circuit
below
was
clearly
and
plainly
wrong
in
misapplying
the
doctrine
of
the
west
decision
to
the
roper
case.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
--
the
equipment
analysis
to
the
fact
that
it
is
attached
to
the
dock
makes
any
difference
whatsoever.
it's
suggested
in
the
government's
brief,
they
have
said
--
some
have
said
examples
perhaps
of
rendering
a
principle
--
reduce
it
to
absurdity
about
--
(inaudible)
running
along
the
dock
and
things
of
that
nature.
but
through
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
sieracki
are
as
on
the
clear
reasoning
that
if
the
equipment
is
being
used
in
a
practical
and
reasonable
relationship
to
the
maritime
service
to
the
vessel,
then
it
should
be
covered
and
its
immaterial
works
on
the
dock.
and
in
fact,
congress,
pardon
me,
congress
has
passed
the
extension
of
admiralty
act
in
title
46
section
740
which
has
held
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
extends
to
the
dock.
well,
if
it
extends
to
the
dock,
a
longshoreman
on
the
dock,
their
cases
--
the
(inaudible)
case
and
others
which
hold
that
it
does
extend
there.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
briefly
for
one
moment
restate
what
was
said
on
last
thursday?
the
question
involved
here
is
whether
or
not
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
is
owed
by
a
vessel
which
has
been
put
into
navigation
for
a
commercial
purpose,
and
well
the
warranty
extends
to
gear
an
equipment
which
is
attached
to
the
dock
on
one
end
but
is
laying
in
the
hole
and
is
performing
maritime
services
in
the
service
to
the
vessel
during
the
unloading
operation.
i
stated
the
piece
of
equipment
involved
in
this
case
is
a
grain
shovels
on
a
marine
leg.
it
leans
over
from
the
dock
into
the
hole
of
the
vessel
and
is
the
only
method
in
which
this
vessel
can
be
unloaded.
this
court
said
recently
in
1959,
west
versus
the
united
states,
that
the
emphasis
now,
the
focus
should
be
upon
the
status
of
the
vessel
in
order
to
determine
the
--
whether
or
not
it
was
in
navigation
and
the
warranty
was
old.
we
believe
that
the
decision
also
imply
that
the
warranty
extends
also
to
gear
and
equipment
which
is
used
in
the
maritime
service
of
the
vessel
which
i
say
practical
and
reasonable
relation
to
the
maritime
service.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
yes
sir,
what
is
the
part
of
a
vessel's
equipment
is
indeed
a
relative
matter,
as
modern
science
progresses,
new
types
of
equipment
are
made
in
the
vessel
and
we
cannot
be
restricted
to
any
particular
type
as
there
are
improvements
going
on
all
the
time.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
well,
this
is
also
used
in
the
maritime
service
as
a
clear
and
practical
relationship
to
the
maritime
service
to
the
vessel.
in
other
words,
through
sieracki
--
starting
sieracki
1946
and
through
to
--
the
crumady
decision
in
1959,
this
court
has
double
attempted
to
make
any
gear
and
equipment
analysis
of
a
type
and
kind.
this
court
has
always
said,
it's
a
clear
reasoning,
that
if
this
equipment
is
used
and
the
maritime
service
and
an
entry
of
thought
arises
out
of
this
service
then
it
is
covered
--
the
warranty
is
covered,
covers
this
type
of
equipment.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
yes
sir,
i
--
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
--
i
had
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
yes
sir.
the
--
a
marine
leg
of
grain
ship
is
a
piece
of
equipment
that
is
attached
to
the
dock
and
it
is
--
it
is
a
funnel
that
goes
over
to
the
hole
of
the
ship
and
it
pulls
up,
it
sucks
up
the
grain
through
the
leg
into
the
grain
way
on
the
other
side.
there
is
no
other
way
to
unload
the
grain
ship.
in
fact
since
1956,
the
government
has
unloaded
28
of
its
own
grain
ships,
here
at
norfolk
with
this
equipment.
we
don't
--
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
i
presume
sir
in
same
way
the
coals'
unloaded
by
shovel
and
--
then
the
holder
to
the
vessels
hole
and
put
on
the
dock.
this
--
this
is
just
an
innovation
the
marine
leg
is
about
to
change
its
status.
now,
if
the
court
--
in
west,
the
court
said
we
will
have
no
job
analysis.
mr.
justice
clark
stated
that
in
his
opinion.
now,
if
we
will
have
no
job
analysis
to
determine
whether
the
maritime
worker
is
entitled
to
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness,
why
should
we
have
in
a
gear
or
equipment
analysis?
indeed
in
the
state
opinion
judge
learned
hand
said,
his
words
were,
“if
the
maritime
thought
arises
out
of
the
service
to
the
vessel,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
or
not
it
arose
on
land
or
it
arose
on
the
vessel.”
and
indeed
congress
to
1947
showed
the
way
by
extending
maritime
jurisdiction
on
the
admiralty
extension
act
to
the
dock.
and
since
admiralty
jurisdiction
is
extend
to
the
dock,
and
certainly
where
this
equipment
is,
it
shows
this
court
that
congress
itself
has
pointed
the
way
for
the
coverage
of
this
type
of
equipment.
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
time
mr.
chief
justice
in
reply
please.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
thank
you.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
distinguished
friend
mentioned
the
--
two
courts
below
rule
was
with
reference
to
affirming
the
majority
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit.
this
court
stated
in
the
mcalister
case
versus
united
states
in
1954
348
u.s.,
that
the
supreme
court
stands
in
the
same
position
in
review
of
the
district
court's
findings
as
the
circuit
--
as
the
court
of
appeals
does
and
if
the
findings
are
clearly
erroneous
when
although
there's
evidence
to
support
that
--
to
support
it,
the
reviewing
court
on
the
entire
evidence
is
left
with
adoptive
conviction
a
mistake
has
been
made
and
this
court
will
reverse.
the
facts
--
this
is
not
a
situation
where
this
court
must
overturn
a
district
court
or
circuit
court's
findings
of
facts
because
the
facts
are
undisputed
here.
there
are
--
there
are
only
one
set
of
facts.
now,
it
is
the
misapplication
of
the
law.
the
west
case
has
been
misapplied
through
the
local
case
and
chief
judge
sobeloff
has
--
has
bear
pointedly
shown
the
way
where
it
ask.
this
--
the
majority
in
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
it
was
a
dead
ship.
this
is
no
dead
ship.
this
ship
was
following
and
doing
the
functions
of
a
ship
unloading
its
grain.
it
was
kind
of
a
like
a
commercial
venture
for
the
owner.
how
can
any
--
any
position
be
made,
however,
this
was
a
dead
ship,
a
deactivated
ship.
now,
the
other
question
involved
regarding
the
equipment,
we
don't
believe
as
we
stated
before
that
it
makes
any
particle
of
difference.
well,
it
would
go
to
see.for
instance,
no
one
ever
supposed
that
the
--
an
atomic
reactor
would
go
to
sea.
but
in
the
savannah
today,
a
merchant
vessel
who
has
been
at
sea
over
a
year,
wholly
and
totally
powered
by
atomic
power,
whoever
supposed
that
that
would
go
to
sea.
mr.
sidney
h.
kelsey
no,
sir.
i
do
not
sir
because
the
facts
are
clearly
with
a
dispute.
the
vessel
was
in
navigation.
she
made
aboard.
she
was
unloading
her
cargo
and
the
only
way
it
could
be
unloaded.
now,
if
you're
going
to
strip
this
longshoreman
of
his
benefit
of
the
warranty
when
he's
using
equipment,
the
only
equipment
that
the
shipowner
has,
however,
provided
him
well.
the
only
equipment
to
do
his
job,
if
you're
going
to
strip
him
of
a
warranty
on
the
basis,
on
the
analysis,
that
one
end
of
the
equipment
is
on
the
dock.
we
think
it's
not
in
accordance
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
equipment
covered
is
given
equipment
which
i
think
practical
and
reasonable
relationship
to
the
maritime
service
of
the
vessel.
everything
were
arises
out
of
a
maritime
service.
all
around
that
vessel
and
floating
in
water,
well
its
type
to
the
dock
(inaudible)
is
the
maritime
protection.
and
congress
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
extended
it
to
the
dock.
now,
as
to
the
other
part
of
the
case
which
my
friend
allude
to
that
we
could
have
sued
someone
else,
we
--
we
didn't
sue
anyone
else.
in
fact,
we
couldn't
because
equipment
actually
was
not
owned
by
continental.
it
was
owned
by
northwest
railroad,
which
was
an
independent
contractor
and
it
leased
equipment
to
continental.
but
the
point
in
case
is
that
the
united
states,
the
largest
shipowner
in
the
world,
provided
this
defective
equipment
for
this
longshoreman
to
you,
and
it
was
docked
at
the
face
and
the
whole
of
the
ship
using
in
it,
as
chief
judge
sobeloff
have
said.
we
believe
the
supreme
court
under
these
facts
would
grant
a
recovery.
thank
you
sir.
