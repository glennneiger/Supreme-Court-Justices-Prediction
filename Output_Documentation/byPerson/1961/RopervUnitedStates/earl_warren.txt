mr.

you
may
continue
your
argument.

mr.
kelsey
just
before
you
get
to
that,
you
said
that
this
was
the
only
way
that
ship
could
be
unloaded,
would
you
elaborate
that
just
a
bit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.

chief

earl
warren
mr.
colby,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
i
understand
from
what
you've
said
a
few
moments
ago
that
we
can
eliminate
from
the
case
the
fact
that
this
ship
had
been
deactivated
and
at
the
time
was
not
in
full
maritime
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
the
grain
was
eliminated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
colby,
may
i
ask
you
this?
as
i
understand,
it
would've
made
no
difference
whether
this
ship
was
fully
activated
or
whether
it
was
inactivated
as
--
as
this
one
had
--
had
been.
the
unloading
would
have
been
exactly
the
same.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
now
just,
let
me
go
on
please.
and
that
the
same
equipment
would
have
been
used
and
that
regardless
of
whether
it
was
an
activated
ship
or
not,
this
injury
would've
occurred
as
it
did
occur.
now,
why
in
those
circumstances
does
it
make
any
difference
in
this
case?
that
the
ship
was
inactivated
as
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
this
is
according
to
your
protection.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
colby
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
my
--
my
question
is
not
the
same
as
mr.
justice
black's.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
difference
does
it
make
in
this
case,
if
the
same
equipment
had
been
used
whether
the
ship
was
activated
or
not
and
if
the
accident
would
have
occurred
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
it
happened
here?
why
â€“
why
are
you
here
arguing
that
one
--
as
one
of
your
questions
that
this
is
deactivated,
admittedly
unseaworthy,
vessel
of
the
mothball
fleet
which
is
out
of
navigation
and
is
being
used
for
the
non-maritime
purpose
of
storing
wheat,
why
do
you
make
that
through
the
first
question
if
those
are
the
facts?
