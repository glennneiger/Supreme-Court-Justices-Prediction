she
did
not,
under
her
own
power
i
guess.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
had
to
bring
her
to
the
dock.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
kelsey.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
say
that
and
--
perhaps,
i
didn't
hear
you
say
it,
but
you
said
it
already.
what
was
involved
before
they
move
in
--
from
change
were
--
map
of
the
change,
was
there
much
had
to
be
done
with
the
ship
in
order
to
take
it
to
20
miles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
it
is
a
“mothballed”.
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
actually
happened.
nothing
was
done
to
put
it
in
shape
for
the
voyage
such
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
put
a
tag
on
it
and
towed
her
away,
was
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
when
she
got
to
the
loading
dock,
wherever
that
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
nothing
except
open
the
hatches
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
fill
up
with
grain
and
then
take
it
back
where
it
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kelsey
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
any
equipment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wondered
mr.
kelsey
if
you're
going
to
talk
us
through
this
(inaudible)
on
this
picture.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
the
scoop
mr.
colby?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
should
you
look
at
this?
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
cant
--
i
can't
follow
this.
i
see
that
--
am
i
looking
at
it
correctly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
it
looks
a
pipe
here
you
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
very
certainly
the
one
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
where's
the
steel
trap
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
steel
trap
broke
or
something
and
release
the
block.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
we
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
can
we
see
it
here
mr.
colby?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
--
while
this
process
is
going
on
a
--
the
scoops
still
attach
somehow
to
the
leg,
this
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
colby
suppose
that
there
had
been
a
ship
and
full
operation
crew
and
everything
else
had
simply
--
and
its
cargo
consisted
this
grain
or
its
loading
equipment
is
functioning
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
but
they
had
the
one
loaded
at
the
site
where
into
this
warehouse,
could
they
have
used
the
ships
equipment
of
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
--
suppose
this
ship
had
been
like
that
in
this
very
accident
have
happened,
would
you
still
be
arguing
that
there
was
no
breach
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
i
--
as
i
understand
it
by
quite
your
correct
words,
a
finding
of
liability
on
the
basis
of
breach
of
seaworthiness,
do
you
think
would
be
supportable
if
this
ship
had
been
as
you
put
it
otherwise
fully
seaworthiness
or
this
fully
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
not,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
on
what
ground
--
on
what
ground
would
he
be
resting
it,
that
he
is
not
doing
seaman's
work
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
colby,
this
had
been
a
commission
ship
and
roper,
not
a
stevedore
employee
but
a
member
the
ship's
crew,
operating
this
thing
at
time
this
happened
and
all
the
other
facts
where
the
--
what
they
are
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
for
a
member
the
ship's
crew?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
–
i'm
assuming
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
assuming
of
course
that
the
--
that
the
ship's
owner,
the
master
or
someone
assigned
roper
as
a
member
the
ship's
crew
do
this
job
in
the
hole?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
–-
on
that
set
of
facts,
we'll
do
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
then
--
would
the
–
that's
to
say
then
that
even
though
he
was
a
member
to
the
crew
in
that
circumstance,
the
shipowner
would
have
no
liability
to
the
seaman?
