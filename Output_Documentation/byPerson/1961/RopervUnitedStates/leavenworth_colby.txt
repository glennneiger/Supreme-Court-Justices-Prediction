mr.
leavenworth
colby
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
my
brother
and
his
distinguished
argument
has
pointed
out
precisely
what
the
difficulty
is
and
how
this
case
came
to
be
decided
and
how
it's
here
today.
he
has
said
that
the
court
in
west
said
that
no
job
analysis
would
serve
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
now,
that
we
think
means
in
effect
that
the
scope
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
must
be
determined
upon
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case.
and
in
this
case,
two
courts
below
have
held
that
in
the
special
facts
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
the
man
here
did
not
suffer
damage
as
a
result
of
the
reasonable
reliance
upon
a
warranty
or
representation
by
the
shipowner
that
the
equipment
which
injured
him
was
safe
or
seaworthy.
one
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
below
dissented.
he
appeared
to
be
of
the
view
that
my
learned
brother
has
so
skillfully
advocated
here,
that
whenever
any
kind
of
a
device
is
used
to
assist
in
the
maritime
operation,
whatever
the
maritime
operation,
that
device
should
be
deemed
to
be
warranted,
to
be
seaworthy
for
a
voyage.
now
of
course,
there
are
certain
semantically
difficulties
about
using
words
in
this
way,
but
i
pass
those.
i
should
like
to
remind
the
court
of
the
origin
and
development
and
analysis
of
what
it
is,
a
breach
of
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
so
skillfully
set
forth
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
also
in
his
dissent
in
the
mitchell
case,
the
concept
to
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
was
originally
developed
in
respect
of
the
shipowner's
warranty
to
the
underwriter
and
the
shipowner's
warranty
to
the
shipper
and
the
shipowner's
warranty
the
passenger.
all
of
whom
were
people
who
knew
nothing
about
what
was
going
on
aboard
with
the
exception
of
the
passenger
they
weren't
even
there.
now,
beginning
with
the
case
of
(inaudible)
the
famous
coal
oil
can
case
where
they
had
gasoline
in
the
coal
oil
can.
this
conception
was
extended
to
cover
a
situation
where
without
fault.
the
shipowner
had
misled
the
seamen.
so
now,
we
find
that
this
conception
of
recovery
for
the
breach
of
warranty
of
seaworthiness
is
precisely
the
same
sort
of
thing
as
the
courts
were
confronted
with
in
connection
with
the
warranty
of
sales.
and
accordingly,
we
found
that
when
we
got
to
sea
rocky,
the
court
very
properly
extended
the
rule
as
the
courts
had
ruled
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
shore
side
property
in
macpherson
against
buick
to
everyone
who
was
within
the
reach
of
the
representation.
and
the
court
most
properly
said,
“we
will
not
draw
the
line
as
to
whether
the
man
is
a
seaman
in
the
strict
sense,
but
we
will
extend
it
wherever
the
man
is
aboard
the
ship
doing
maritime
work
or
as
they
keep
saying
work
of
the
same
nature
as
the
seaman.”
now,
that
of
course
as
this
court
has
developed
through
the
years,
then
requires
the
same
factors
that
it
does
in
a
breach
of
warranty
of
sale
onshore.
there
must
be
a
representation
that
something
is
fit
for
a
purpose.
there
must
be
a
reasonable
reliance
upon
that
representation
and
there
must
be
an
injury
causally
resulting
from
the
reasonable
reliance.
and
this
court
through
a
series
of
decisions
has
developed
and
expanded
this
rule.
most
significant
it
seems
to
me
in
the
context
we
have
today,
is
as
both
courts
below
thought,
this
court's
decision
in
the
west
case
where
the
court
held
that
if
the
shipowner
did
not
represent
that
the
vessel
was
seaworthy
but
on
the
contrary
represented
that
it
was
unseaworthy,
the
man
could
not
rely
upon
any
inconsistent
implication
of
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
now,
two
courts
below
appreciating
the
facts
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
the
same
sort
of
thing.
now,
my
brother's
argument
it
seems
to
me,
pre-supposes
a
representation
that
the
courts
below
decided
against
his
client
solely
because
they
thought
this
vessel
was
not
in
navigation.
and
secondarily,
that
this
matter
was
one
resulting
from
a
part
of
the
real
estate
onshore
which
extended
over
into
the
hole
when
it's
sucked
up
the
grain.
now,
i
don't
think
that
that
isn't
anyways
consistent
with
what
the
court
below
actually
said,
because
if
your
honors
will
examine
pages
102,
103
and
so
forth
of
the
record,
you
will
see
that
that
is
not
at
all
what
the
court
of
appeals
thought
about
the
case.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
with
respect
to
a
special
factual
situation
like
this,
there
was
no
representation
by
the
shipowner
that
the
unloading
equipment
of
the
vessel
was
seaworthy
and
properly
maintained
because
it
all
has
been
taken
off.
it
says
that,
at
the
bottom
of
page
102,
“no
such
limited
use
could
give
rise
to
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness
of
unloading
equipment,
all
of
which
was
still
in
mothballs”
and
that
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
blooms
were
still
aboard
but
they
were
lashed
down
or
completely
removed.
now,
my
brother
very
properly
says
that
here,
he
wouldn't
have
unloaded
it
with
the
ship's
equipment
in
any
event.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
far
from
giving
rise
to
an
implication
in
the
circumstances,
that
the
shipowner
warranted
the
seaworthiness
for
a
voyage
of
the
equipment
which
was
passed
to
the
dock,
which
could
not
go
on
a
voyage
and
which
could
not
for
all
practical
purposes
ever
be
inspected,
controlled,
examined,
repaired,
or
what
have
you
by
the
shipowner.
this
is
not
within
the
scope.
now,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
this
picture
that
you'll
have
of
the
marine
leg
and
see
where
it
is
up
there
before
its
--
when
it's
retracted
before
it's
introduced
into
the
ship.
and
you
will
see
that
so
far
as
the
ship's
people
are
concerned,
all
it
can
do
is
look
up
and
see
it
as
a
part
of
the
real
estate.
it's
attached
to
this
tower
which
is
attached
to
the
grain
elevator
and
it
swings
out
and
comes
down.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
the
scoops
are
stored
in
this
point
here
of
the
bucket.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
it's
very
difficult
to
look
at
this.
i
think
the
structure
is
directed
you
see
on
--
on
steel
legs.
it's
goes
up
like
this
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
it's
swung
up.
it
swings
down.
now,
the
--
the
scoops
or
shovels
are
stored
in
between
the
two
parts
of
the
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
you're
looking
at
a
correctly.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
the
leg
which
reaches
down
in
the
vessel.
if
your
honor
please,
it
works
something
like
this
if
i
may
take
a
couple
a
rulers
here.
here
is
the
thing
pass
to
the
dock.
you
see
it
in
this
position
like
this,
up
like
this.
now,
when
it
is
to
be
introduced
into
the
ship,
they
extend
it
down
into
the
hold
of
the
ship
like
this.
now,
this
leg
which
you
see
in
the
picture
here
along
the
edge
is
a
clamshell
buckle
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
no,
that
pipe
is
not
a
device
in
question.
that's
a
suction
type
leg.
that
works
on
the
vacuum
cleaner.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
the
one
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
this
clamshell
bucket
--
on
top
at
here.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
and
that
goes
down
to
the
bottom
that
has
a
foot
that
rests
ultimately
in
the
bottom
the
hold
of
the
ship
and
the
buckets
run
around
on
an
endless
chain
lifting
the
grain
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
there
was
a
block
attached
to
the
bottom
of
the
leg.
that
is
because
as
your
honor
will
remember
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
once
the
grain
gets
slow.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
no,
at
this
point
it's
stored
back
in
the
leg.
they
--
when
the
grain
is
gotten
to
such
a
point
that
the
grain
no
longer
flows
against
the
leg,
then
they
take
out
the
leg,
these
scoops
and
they
pull
by
power
at
furnish
from
the
dock,
the
scoops
through
the
remaining
grain
to
get
the
grain
against
the
bucket.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
the
scoop
has
a
line;
just
like
a
bull
line,
it
has
a
line
that
goes
over
a
pulley
or
block
on
the
marine
leg
and
up
to
block
to
the
source
of
power.
and
they
have
a
clutch
device
with
a
hand
rope
that
the
chap
pulls
and
while
he
has
that
pulled,
it
takes
up
tension
and
draws
the
scoop
through
the
grain.
see,
this
is
only
used
at
the
--
on
the
last
grain.
that
other
vacuum
cleaner
type
device
you
see
there
was
--
will
lift
grain
almost
to
the
last
bucketful.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that's
the
type
that
you
see
somewhere
down.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
but
you
see
that's
a
much
slower
device.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
the
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
don't
think,
if
your
honor
please,
you
can
never
eliminate
that
sort
of
thing
for
a
case.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
said
--
i
said
that
you
cannot
rest
it
on
that
ground
alone
that
it
is
a
factual
question
overall.
what
is
the
scope
of
the
representation
of
what
is
seaworthy?
now,
because
this
vessel
had
all
of
its
unloading
equipment
removed
from
it,
because
this
vessel
was
not
licensed
to
do
anything,
because
this
vessel
merely
floated
upon
the
water
as
a
floating
granary.
the
scope
of
the
representation
to
the
man
of
what
might
be
in
a
seaworthy
condition
for
a
voyage
if
will
and
if
you
will
join
my
brother
in
the
conception
that
this
is
a
voyage
going
from
the
reserve
fleet
over
to
be
unloaded,
a
short
distance.
still
you
are
presented
with
the
question,
what
is
the
scope
of
the
warranty?
what
does
the
shipowner
represent?
and
the
court
below
said,
that
in
these
special
circumstances,
he
didn't
represent
that
the
loading
equipment
whether
shore
side
or
on
the
ship,
was
seaworthy
for
a
voyage
because
there
was
no
loading
equipment
aboard
the
ship.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
no.
they
wouldn't
have
used
this
equipment
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
i
think
is
what
mr.
chief
justice
warren
is
addressing
himself
to
when
he
says,
really
that
--
what
i
say
he
says
that
the
question
of
the
navigation
in
so
forth
has
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
it.
and
in
the
sense
that
your
honors
takes
it,
i
take
it
that
so.
in
other
words,
if
the
vessel
had
been
fully
seaworthy
for
a
voyage,
they
still
would
have
used
the
marine
leg.
the
marine
legs
still
would
have
been
a
matter
concerning
which
the
shipowner
could
know
nothing
and
it
would
be
a
device
which
was
not
like
ships
equipment.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes,
but
i
assume
if
that
were
so
in
appraising
and
discussing
the
special
facts
of
the
case,
the
court
would
have
thought
it
necessary
to
put
it
primarily
on
the
ground
that
this
man
was
not
engaged
in
ships
work
and
he
was
not
using
ships
equipment.
now
remember,
this
man
is
the
foreman
of
atlantic
and
gulf
stevedores,
who
are
the
people
hired
by
continental
grain
company,
the
operators
of
the
elevator
and
the
owners
to
the
marine
leg,
to
do
this
particular
job.
the
record
shows
that
this
is
the
man
who
on
this
day
inspected
this
leg
to
see
whether
it
was
suitable
and
so
forth.
and
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
because
i
do
not
think
that
the
shipowner
warrants
that
equipment
which
is
not
appropriate
to
go
on
a
voyage
of
the
ship,
is
warranted
seaworthy
for
a
voyage.
in
other
words,
passing
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
would
be
resting
it
primarily
upon
the
ground
that
part
of
the
real
estate
is
nothing
which
is
warranted
as
part
of
a
vessel
seaworthy
to
go
to
sea.
now,
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
as
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
most
recently
points
out
in
the
mitchell
case,
is
a
warranty
that
the
ship
and
appurtenances
and
equipment
of
the
ship
are
seaworthy
for
a
voyage
and
--
and
of
course
this
was
the
point
primarily
of
the
mitchell
case,
that
they
will
be
maintained
seaworthy
for
a
voyage
and
thus
where
the
shipowner
in
mitchell
didn't
keep
the
rail
free
from
slime.
and
the
man
came
up
from
his
cabin
expecting
that
the
rail
would
be
by
that
time
free
from
slimes
since
that
was
the
way
he
got
on
the
dock
was
by
stepping
on
the
rail
and
he
slipped.
there
was
apparently
on
the
record
of
breach
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
now
here,
there
is
no
representation
as
to
the
seaworthiness
for
the
voyage
of
equipment
which
cannot
go
on
the
voyage,
but
must
always
remain
fast
to
the
dock.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that's
right.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
and
if
the
(voice
overlap)
had
broken
as
in
the
patterson
case,
or
wire
had
given
way
as
in
the
rogers
case
or
a
shackle
had
broken
as
in
sieracki
or
any
of
these
other
things
of
ships
equipment,
he
would
at
that
time
have
been
within
the
warranty.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
but
this
man
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
please.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that's
right.
in
other
words,
this
is
just
one
factor
and
that
of
course
is
what
the
west
case
has
thought,
that
you
cannot
decide
these
questions
by
saying
the
ship
is
--
there
is
not
a
navigation
by
saying
that
the
man's
work
in
general
is
or
his
not
maritime
employment.
now,
certainly
this
man
if
you
do
it
as
my
brother
would
have
you
that
he
was
unloading
the
ship,
this
is
clearly
a
maritime
employment
of
the
kind
that
a
seaman
does.
on
the
other
hand
if
he
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
what
was
the
individual
man
doing.
in
other
words,
he
was
the
man
that
looked
after
this
shore
side
device.
he
is
--
in
the
capacity
of
looking
after
the
shore
side
device
as
foreman
for
this
operation,
he
is
not
doing
in
that
quality
seaman's
work.
now,
he
went
exactly
the
same
sorts
of
problem
in
connection
with
crumady
and
halecki
and
everything
else,
and
this
is
why
it
cannot
be
determined
by
any
kind
of
shibboleth.
you
cannot
decide
that
it's
a
navigation
or
it's
not
a
navigation,
the
fellow
has
got
a
job
classification
to
do
this
or
that.
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
individual
parties
do.
what
was
this
man
supposed
to
do?
what
was
the
actual
representation?
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
would
say
there
was
no
warranty
of
seaworthiness
there
that
that
is
deferent
from
the
stricker
case,
were
ships
equipment
slid
of
the
ship
and
hit
the
man,
injuring
him
while
he
was
standing
on
the
dock.
because
there
the
equipment,
the
appurtenances
of
the
ship
which
are
warranted
to
be
seaworthy
and
to
be
main
--maintain
see
were
they
failed
and
stricker
got
hurt.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
there
might
be
a
warranty
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
precisely.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
and
here
of
course,
there
is
not
doubt
about
mr.
roper's
right
to
sue
continental
grain
company
who
was
not
his
employer
and
presented
no
compensation
questions.
and
it
was
continentals
grain's
failure
to
maintain
the
marine
leg
properly
which
caused
the
damage.
there
would
be
no
doubts
so
far
as
i
can
see
about
mr.
roper's
right
to
sue
continental
grain
company
and
recover
for
negligence.
in
other
words
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
was
a
maintenance
in
jury
case
if
your
honor
please,
not
a
unseaworthiness
case.
in
other
words,
the
question
was
not
that
the
house
had
an
unseaworthy
balcony
and
that
the
ship
was
charged
with
that
but
rather
that
being
in
a
house
or
shore
was
authorize
recreation
for
a
seaman
in
a
foreign
port.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes,
i
imagine
that
after
that
experience,
he
was
somewhat
more
careful
and
never
went
into
a
house
that
had
a
balcony.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
should
think
that
the
answer
is
the
same
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
in
other
words,
the
shipowner
warrants
the
seaworthiness
for
a
voyage
of
the
ship
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
and
her
equipment.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well
of
course
it's
a
little
difficult
as
a
practical
matter
because
this
is
a
skilled
work
with
a
shore
side
device.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
but
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
should
think
on
the
set
of
facts,
there
it
was
no
breach
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
because
it
is
not
an
appurtenance
of
the
vessel.
they
went
so
far
--
now,
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
the
question
of
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
as
long
as
that
maintenance
in
cure.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
and
he
might
be
liable
for
negligence.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
but
he
would
not
be
liable
on
the
ground
that
there
had
any
--
was
any
representation
by
a
shipowner
that
a
shore
side
equipment
which
he
couldn't
see
or
have
anything
to
do
with,
had
not
been
maintained
properly.
in
other
words,
it's
a
question
and
that
is
what
the
court
below
so
carefully
recognized
that
pages
102,
103,
and
104
of
the
records
that
this
is
a
factual
question
of
what
is
the
scope
of
the
representation
and
was
the
reasonable
reliance.
now,
on
the
reasonable
reliance,
please
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
the
man
who
had
the
duty
of
inspecting
this
thing.
no
one
would
have
any
better
chance
to
know
about
it
than
he.
and
bear
in
mind
that
instead
of
suing
continental
of
people
whose
machinery
brooked
on
it,
he
proceeds
to
sue
the
shipowner.
now,
i
don't
blame
him
one
little
bit
because
if
you
can
get
away
with
it
so
to
speak,
why
--
it
requires
very
little
from
proof
of
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness
and
proof
of
the
case
of
negligence.
it's
idle
for
me
to
stand
here
and
mr.
kelsey
just
stand
here
in
the
court
to
consider
what
turned
out
on
the
record.
i
don't
suppose
mr.
kelsey
was
this
convinced
when
he
got
his
case
under
way.
the
continental
would
be
shown
pretty
well
on
the
record
to
be
negligent.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes
sir.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
think
we
did
presented
in
our
position
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
into
the
certiorari.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
and
in
the
brief
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
but
the
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well,
now
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
these
shows
why
the
ordinary
rule
is
that
you
urge
anything
in
support
of
the
decision
below
because
we're
drawn
into
this.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i'm
--
with
my
eyes,
it's
not
possible
for
me
to
read
the
opposition
that
quickly
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes,
but
it's
a
good
long
time
ago
since
i
read
the
opposition.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
and
since
--
no
i
didn't
write
it.
since
this
question
about
the
dock
has
been
in
the
case
from
the
beginning,
i
am
little
of
the
opinion
that
it's
probably
braided
in
there
somewhere.
but
let
me
say
this.
i
think
it's
entirely
under
the
issue
which
the
court
below
raised,
despite
the
fact
that
they
defined
it
out
because
the
question
is
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
the
question
is,
what
is
the
scope
of
the
warranty
that
the
shipowner
made?
now,
they
get
out
of
it
by
this
matter
at
the
bottom
of
page
102,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
which
they
say
that
there
was
no
representation
as
to
any
kind
of
loading
equipment.
therefore,
i
take
it
they're
saying
that
that
includes
loading
equipment
on
the
shore.
now,
this
is
perhaps
not
the
way
i
would
have
done
if
i
have
been
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
but
we
are
--
we
are
obliged
to
take
the
case
the
way
they
find
it.
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
new
issue
as
shown
by
the
briefs
–-
briefing
in
the
record
generally.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that's
right.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
this
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
this
is
what
mr.
justice
black
very
properly
raises.
now,
what
we're
raising
in
the
--
you
and
mr.
justice
black
are
raising
that
the
analysis
that
the
court
below
made
was
not
as
practicable
it
seems
to
me,
an
analysis.
in
other
words,
they
take
it
by
saying,
since
there
was
no
representation
that
any
loading
equipment
was
seaworthy,
there
is
no
representation
that
this
shore
side
loading
equipment
was
seaworthy.
therefore,
they
say
that
there
is
no
occasion
for
passing
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
this
is
to
be
treated
like
the
wire
and
the
snatch
block
in
the
other
cases
or
whether
it's
to
be
treated
like
the
grinding
wheel
in
berryhill
where
the
court
said,
“well
that
was
not
ship's
type
equipment.”
mr.
leavenworth
colby
what
this
does
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
think
that
we
make
our
first
question
because
that
is
the
way
that
the
court
below
ceased
upon
it.
as
i
say
to
you,
they
viewed
the
question
that
there
was
no
warranty
of
seaworthiness
in
respect
of
any
equipment
on
the
vessel.
therefore,
there
was
none
in
respect
of
the
land
based
equipment
attached
to
the
real
estate.
now,
your
honor
is
perfectly
correct
that
if
instead
of
approaching
the
problem
from
the
standpoint
of
the
analysis
of
the
court
below,
but
rather
from
the
facts
themselves,
we
see
immediately
upon
analysis
of
the
facts
themselves,
that
it
would
not
have
made
any
difference.
now,
i
don't
think
that
that
means
that
the
court
below
is
wrong.
it
merely
means
that
the
opinion
is
somewhat
inartificial
because
they
reached
the
shore-side
equipment
by
saying
there
was
no
warranty
at
all.
therefore,
there
was
no
warranty
of
shore
side
equipment.
therefore,
we
don't
need
to
examine
the
scope
of
the
shore
side
equipment.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well,
i
suppose
what
they
decided
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
think
what
they
decide
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
is
that
in
the
circumstances,
yes,
but
there's
a
difference
between
what's
decided
and
what
is
said.
i
think
what
they
decided
was,
that
in
this
circumstances,
the
shipowner
had
not
made
any
representation
upon
which
the
plaintiff
relied
and
which
the
shipowner
had
breached.
now,
i
think
that's
the
essential
holding
of
the
case.
now,
the
opinion
keeps
discussing
this
in
terms
that
there
was
no
warranty
of
unloading
equipment
because
of
the
special
circumstances
of
the
case
that
the
unloading
equipment
had
been
taken
out
and
off
of
the
vessel.
and
you
and
chief
justice
very
properly
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
actually
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
i.e.
the
removal
of
grain
out
of
the
railroad
car,
out
of
the
barge,
out
of
a
vessel,
out
of
anything.
you
can't
do
it
with
tackle
like
a
ship
has.
you
have
to
do
it
either
with
a
sucking
device
or
with
the
clamshell
pocket
device.
now,
again
i
say
to
you,
this
is
the
question
on
the
one
hand
between
the
factual
analysis
of
it
and
the
way
of
the
opinion
discusses
it.
but
i
don't
think
when
the
court
below
was
not
wrong,
even
though
it
talked
about
it
the
wrong
way,
that
that
is
a
ground
for
reversal.
i
think
it
may
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
very
well
be
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
no,
i
think
the
court's
opinion
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that's
right.
and
i
emphasized
that
the
court's
opinion
shows
which
is
indubitably
correct
that
the
shipowner
made
no
warranty
as
to
the
seaworthiness
and
maintenance
and
fitness
of
any
kind
of
unloading
equipment.
and
since
they
made
no
warranty
as
to
unloading
equipment,
the
court
below
said
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
as
distinct
from
a
case
where
they
was
unloading
equipment,
that
might
have
been
warranted.
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
that
took
care
of
the
problem
or
whether
it
was
aboard
or
ashore.
and
i
think
this
is
not
only
logically
but
practically
a
perfectly
permissible
way
to
go
about
it
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
although
it
doesn't
post
a
good
case
for
certiorari
because
this
court
wants
to
decide
the
more
important
question,
which
is
your
honors
have
pointed
out
is
presented
on
a
ship
in
navigation
no
--
just
the
same
as
on
the
ship
out
on
navigation.
but
that's
the
question
of
the
scope
of
certiorari
after
the
court
has
granted
it.
it
has
nothing
to
do
in
my
opinion,
with
the
question
whether
the
court
below
was
wrong
because
it
was
not.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
it
is
my
understanding
that
that
has
never
been
the
con
--
the
doctrine
with
respect
to
this
court
anymore
than
with
respect
to
an
appellate
court.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
in
other
words
you
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
you
are
ordinarily
tried
to
present
the
case
in
support
of
the
decision
below
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
but
you
are
not
bound
by
that.
you
also
try
to
explain
that
there
are
factors
which
the
court
below
shows
to
gloss
over,
which
are
equally
important
if
not
more
controlling.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
many
times
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
many
times
your
honor
and
some
of
them
were
matters
that
were
very
wide
for
many
doctrine
about
jurisdiction
or
anything
like
that
mr.
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
correct.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
did
not
think
that
i
had
taken
it
on
the
ground
that
the
court
had
decided
it
that
way.
i
thought
that
i
had
taken
it
upon
the
ground
that
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stewart
put
it
to
me
and
what
we
are
now
getting
to
here
now
that
actually,
and
i
would
assume
for
purposes
of
this
court's
opinion
in
deciding
the
case.
it
should
not
be
ignored
that
although
the
court
of
appeals
shows
in
dealing
with
the
case
on
its
special
facts
to
view
with
it
that
way
that
is
not
the
only
situation
in
which
this
problem
would
be
presented.
and
that
i'm
sure
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
stewart
to
imply
at
one
point,
this
is
quite
an
exceptional
case
to
have
this
happen
on
a
deactivated
vessel
coming
up
from
the
reserve
fleet.
it
probably
happens
everyday,
constantly
in
respect
to
grain
ships
on
the
great
lakes
in
the
sense
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well,
with
difference
your
honor,
that
is
what
i
have
thrice
said.
i
don't
think
is
an
altogether
fair
interpretation
of
the
way
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
went
about
it,
although
they
do
say,
they
don't
have
to
decide
the
question
of
the
grinding
wheel
in
berryhill
versus
the
snatch
block
in
patterson.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes,
sir.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
they
do
expressly
say
that.
and
that
puts
them
in
the
opposition
that
they
have
decided
the
case
on
the
ground
that
when
there
is
no
warranty
as
to
the
seaworthiness
of
any
equipment,
that
covers
the
situation
that
there
is
no
warranty
as
to
the
seaworthiness
of
shore-based
equipment,
and
this
is
logically
on
unassailable.
however,
much
it
may
represent
a
chance
to
throw
away
an
opportunity
to
instruct
the
district
courts
in
the
bar
as
to
what
the
applicable
law
would
be.
i
have
no
occasion
to
teach
that
with
your
experience
in
the
legislature.
i
have
no
occasion
to
teach
that
much
trouble
would
be
avoided
if
judges
in
courts
of
appeal
would
recognize
that
in
addition
to
deciding
the
particular
case,
they
are
also
engaged
in
providing
guidance
to
district
courts
and
lawyers
who
have
other
cases
coming
along.
now,
i
must
agree
with
you
that
the
court
below
didn't
take
the
opportunity
to
recognize
that
this
problem
is
presented
in
this
case
on
a
ship
where
there
was
no
loading
equipment
of
board
but
could
have
been
presented
equally
on
a
case
where
there
was
loading
equipment
of
board.
but
i
remind
you
again
mr.
justice,
that
there
is
an
old
judicial
concept
and
approach
that
you
always
decide
everything
on
the
narrowest
possible
grounds.
now
again
and
again
and
again,
this
has
been
proven
to
be
an
awkward
way
of
deciding
cases.
i'm
sure
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
can
provide
some
delightful
examples
because
as
i
recall
when
i
went
to
school
to
him
nearly
30
year
ago,
he
then
had
something
of
the
sort
which
he
tried
it
out
as
examples
of
how
judges
by
trying
to
be
too
narrow
had
not
done
themselves
to
the
bar
any
good.
so
it
seems
to
me
what
we
have
is
the
case
where
this
court
may
very
well
want
to
deal
with
the
other
aspect,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there's
any
necessity
just
because
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
do
it
in
felicitously.
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed,
because
i
think
quite
to
contrary.
there's
everything
in
the
record
and
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
there
is
implicit
what
your
honor
has
raised.
thank
you.
