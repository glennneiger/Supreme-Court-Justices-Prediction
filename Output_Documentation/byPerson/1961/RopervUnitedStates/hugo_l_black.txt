mr.
colby.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
a
little
disturbed
by
your
argument
because
i
think
you're
arguing
something
as
the
court
--
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
laid
aside
and
which
you
did
not
even
present
as
a
question
in
your
opposition
to
this
certiorari.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
proposition
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
present.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
present
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
your
question,
i
find
not
even
a
semblance
of
an
argument.
and
i
assume
that
was
because
the
court
said
at
101,
the
district
court
did
not
consider
whether
the
usual
warranty
of
seaworthiness
would
encompass
this
sort
of
shore-based,
shore
attached
equipment
for
it
held,
there
was
no
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
since
we
agree,
we
also
confine
ourselves
to
the
holdings
that
there
was
here
no
warranty
of
the
seaworthiness
of
any
unloading
equipment.
and
then
they
proceed
and
decided
on
the
basis
to
the
west
case
holding
of
a
deactivated
ship
and
i
find
nothing
in
you
original
opposition
to
this
certiorari
indicates
that
you
or
whoever
wrote
that
brief,
thought
there
was
in
a
such
question
here
as
you
are
now
presenting
with
reference
to
--
except
the
single
question
of
the
west
case
that
this
was
deactivated
ship.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
am
i
correct
in
your
opposition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
did
not
--
have
you
not
read
it?
have
you
not
read
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
write
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
below
did
define
it
out
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
evident
now
in
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
all
they
decided,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
they
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
they
said
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
i
understood
that
if
that
has
been
your
first
presentation
of
your
case.
but
you
win
until
i
ask
you
the
question,
as
i
understood
you
on
the
argument
if
the
court's
opinion
showed
what
now
you
say
it
does
not
show.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
read
from
the
page
102
and
103.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
colby,
when
you
or
any
other
lawyer
comes
here
to
sustain
a
judgment,
it
--
has
it
been
the
guiding
of
this
court
that
you
are
restricted
in
sustaining
the
judgment
not
only
to
the
ground
but
to
the
language
of
the
opinion
below,
the
decision
of
which
you
are
sustaining?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
my
understanding
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
you
presented
that
late.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
(voice
overlap)
--
have
you
understood
for
many
thing
i
said
that
the
implication
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
made
were
intended
to
be
made
by
me,
that
a
man
cannot
defend
his
judgment
on
anything
he
desires.
i
asked
why?
after
you
have
been
arguing
a
case
for
a
long
time,
you
took
it
on
the
position
that
the
court
had
decided
it
that
way,
when
the
record
shows
it
had
none.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
court
(voice
overlap)
remains,
does
it
not?
that
you
are
asking
us
to
decide
this
case
now
on
the
basis
of
facts
and
you
say
a
factual
basis,
the
very
important
which
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
haven't
passed
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
not
express
to
say
that
they
do
not
have
to
decide
anything
upon
the
basis
of
the
shore-base?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
do?
