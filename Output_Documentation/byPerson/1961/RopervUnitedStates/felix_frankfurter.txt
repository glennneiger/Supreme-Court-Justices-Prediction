perhaps,
you
--
perhaps
you
explain
the
difficulty,
but
let
me
put
it
specifically.
deriving
my
question
arise
from
your
statement
a
little
while
ago
regarding
the
stages
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely
that
he
was
a
foreman
is
it
where
and
oversea
for
the
stevedoring
company
concerned,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
the
same
person
with
the
same
status
and
the
same
function
that
going
aboard
a
ship
of
this
shipowner,
the
ship
fit
for
voyage,
he
would
have
--
under
sieracki
come
within
the
protection
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
seaworthiness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
say,
if
may
finish
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
my
purpose
of
clearing
up
my
thought.
you
say
that
the
relevance
of
his
relationship
to
the
stevedoring
concern
and
not
to
the
shipowner,
the
relevance
derives
from
the
fact
that
this
isn't
part
of
the
ship's
equipment
for
a
–-
for
a
sea
voyage
and
therefore
a
fortiori
you
said.
first,
he
was
an
employee
of
the
stevedoring
concern
isn't
being
warranted
seaworthiness
of
an
equipment
that's
not
never
part
of
a
ship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
the
--
although
the
injury
is
causally
connected
with
equipment
on
land
and
forever
remaining
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
this
--
if
this
had
been
an
ordinary
seaman
of
active
live
ship,
and
even
sent
aboard
of
--
been
sent
ashore
by
the
mate
or
the
mass
or
the
captain
or
want
not,
to
do
a
job
--
to
do
a
job
connected
with
this
installation
and
he
had
been
inject,
what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
he
might
--
there
might
be
a
warranty
on
the
buick
but
not
because
of
the
seaworthy
doctrine,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
mate
sends
him
over
--
suppose
the
mate
sends
him
ashore
and
he
asked
to
use
a
car,
that's
the
use
of
buick,
the
buick
has
the
inherent
effect
of
the
buick
had
in
a
new
york
case,
they
might
sue
the
buick
company
but
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
through
the
shipowner
on
the
ground
of
unseaworthiness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
bearing
–
what's
the
bearing
of
that
romeo
case,
the
fellow
got
drunk
and
got
on
the
seaman,
get
on
the
balcony
somewhere
in
venice
or
where
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
a
cure
for
romeo,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
even
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
–
am
i
right
in
my
recollection
that
this
court
has
decided
cases
on
ground
never
adverted
to
either
by
the
court
below
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
counsel
at
the
bar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
here's
against
--
here's
the
question
was
really
raised
on
which
a
constitution
decision
have
rested?
