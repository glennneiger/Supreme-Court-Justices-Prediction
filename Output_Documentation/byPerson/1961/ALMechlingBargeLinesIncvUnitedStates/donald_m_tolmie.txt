mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
addressing
myself
to
subject
to
which
are
--
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
oh,
forgive
me.
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
i
thought
that
your
time
was
through.
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
great
deal
has
been
raised
as
to
the
factual
situation
here
with
the
rates.
i
think
it's
rather
important
that
this
be
reviewed.
the
grain
traffic
here
involved
moves
from
northern
illinois,
origin,
to
eastern
destinations.
the
rates
on
which
this
traffic
moves
are
made
up
of
two
parts,
one
is
a
rate
into
chicago
and
the
second
portion
is
a
reshipping
rate
from
chicago
to
the
east.
now,
prior
to
the
rate
reduction
of
1959,
prior
to
the
reduction
here
involved,
the
western
railroads
had
in
effect
reduced
the
rates
into
chicago
at
the
same
time
the
water
carriers
had
rates
in
effect
into
chicago.
the
eastern
railroads
had
reshipping
rates
which
applied
from
chicago
to
eastern
destinations
on
practically
all
traffic,
grain
traffic
originating
in
western
territory.
however,
there's
one
glaring
exception
to
this
and
that
is
on
grain
from
northern
illinois
origins
arriving
at
chicago
by
rail.
these
reshipping
rates
would
not
apply.
now,
the
reason
for
the
--
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
on
grain
from
northern
illinois
arriving
at
chicago
by
rail,
the
eastern
railroad's
reshipping
rates
applicable
from
chicago
to
the
east
would
not
apply.
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
what
would
apply
would
be
the
inbound
rail
rate
plus
an
amount
necessary
to
equal
the
local
rate
which
was
applicable
from
chicago
to
the
east.
now,
the
purpose
of
this
was
that
without
applying
a
rate
greater
than
the
reshipping
rate
in
chicago,
the
railroads
would
be
in
violation
of
the
long
and
short-haul
laws.
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
well,
it's
called
a
proportional
rate.
the
rate
applies
only
if
there
has
been
a
prior
movement
inbound
to
that
point.
normally,
there
would
be
transit
at
that
point.
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
no.
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
sir,
or
your
honor
i'd
like
to
get
to
that
--
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
--
if
i
may
in
just
the
moment.
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
from
--
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
yes
sir.
on
barge
traffic
originating
in
northern
illinois
distant
to
the
east
which
arrives
at
chicago
by
barge,
this
reshipping
rate
would
apply
and
still
does
apply.
this
was
a
result
of
the
mechling
barge
line
case
where
in
this
court
required
that
the
chicago
to
the
east
railroads
cannot
lawfully
charge
more
for
carrying
ex-barge
grain
than
they
can
charge
for
carrying
ex-lake
or
ex-rail
grain
to
or
from
the
same
locations.
now,
the
effect
--
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
that
is
correct.
the
effect
of
the
rate
provisions
that
is
the
effect
of
the
availability
of
the
reshipping
rate
to
ex-barge
traffic,
and
the
unavailability
of
this
reshipping
rate
to
ex-rail
traffic
--
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
reshipping
rate
--
mr.
donald
m.
tolmie
yes.
if
it
we're
not,
the
reshipping
rate
would
apply.
the
effect
of
this
is
--
was
an
exact
turnabout
of
what
faced
the
commission
in
the
--
or
rather
faced
the
court
in
the
mechling
barge
line
case.
the
railroads
were
charging
more,
the
eastern
railroads
were
charging
more
on
ex-rail
traffic
to
northern
illinois
than
they
were
charging
on
ex-barge
traffic
from
northern
illinois.
now,
because
of
the
--
because
of
section
4
of
the
act,
the
railroads
before
they
could
affect
any
change
in
this,
had
to
deal
with
the
rates
from
the
intermediate
points.
that
is
the
local
rates
from
chicago
or
the
local
rates
from
indiana
to
the
east.
this
could
be
dealt
with
in
two
manners.
either
to
reduce
the
rates
at
the
intermediate
points,
the
local
rates
from
chicago
to
the
east,
or
to
seek
fourth
section
relief
to
maintain
the
high
rates
of
the
intermediate
points
and
permit
the
combination
of
the
rail
rate
in
the
chicago
and
the
reshipping
rate
out
of
chicago
to
apply
to
this
traffic.
what
the
railroads
did
elect
to
do
was
to
secure
fourth
section
relief.
their
application
was
filed.
all
interested
parties
including
the
appellants
here
did
file,
did
have
the
opportunity
and
did
file
protests.
in
these
protests,
they
stated
their
views.
now,
as
a
result
of
the
relief
granted,
the
eastern
railroads
were
able
to
charge
the
same
for
their
service
from
chicago
to
the
east
whether
the
traffic
arrived
by
barge
or
grain
or
rail
at
chicago.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
same
result
here
could've
been
reached
by
reducing
the
lower
rates
from
chicago
--
by
reducing
the
short-haul
rates
applicable
from
chicago
to
the
east.
now
in
fact,
this
is
what
was
ultimately
done
in
march
of
1959.
the
railroads
at
that
time
reduced
the
short-haul
rates.
by
this
reduction,
any
violation
or
departure
from
the
long
and
short-haul
clause
was
removed
and
any
relief
which
the
railroads
had
been
granted
under
the
fourth
section
orders
here
involved,
expired.
the
appellants
here
have
asserted
that
the
reductions
in
the
short-haul
rates,
that
is
the
rates
from
chicago
and
indiana
points
was
done
solely
or
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
a
judicial
determination
of
validity
of
the
orders
in
this
case.
all
i
can
say,
since
there's
nothing
more
in
the
record
that
this
was
not
the
fact,
that
there
were
other
economic
factors
which
were
involved.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
