mr.
friedman,
i
just
like
to
add
to
your
burden,
but
there
is
a
question
that
your
brief
doesn't
answer,
and
that
is
that
if
a
damage
suit
were
brought,
i
suppose
maybe
the
--
maybe
you're
not
the
counsel
to
answer
this.
i
suppose
that
the
defense
were
to
invoke
the
abilene
doctrine?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
primary
jurisdiction
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
of
the
commission
therefore
it
would
be
back
in
the
damage
suit
precisely
where
we
are
in
this
suit.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
don't
advert
to
that
in
your
brief?
