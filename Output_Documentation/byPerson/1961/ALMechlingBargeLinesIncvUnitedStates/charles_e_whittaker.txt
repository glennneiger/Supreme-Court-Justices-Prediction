justice
charles
e.
whittaker
pardon,
i
didn't
understand
your
last
statement.
i
didn't
understand
it.
i'm
sorry.
you're
left
with
me.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may,
i
ask
you
please,
is
this
matter
in
contest
now?
does
not
the
solicitor
general
concede
your
point?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
he
conceded
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
it
true
that
before
findings
could
be
made,
some
hearing
would
have
to
precede?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
that
case,
as
i
understand
it
and
the
ones
like
it
go
to
the
question
of
mootness,
but
if
you
get
over
that
and
reach
the
merits,
then
does
not
the
solicitor
general
practically
concede
your
position
on
the
merits?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
some
hearings,
but
must
it
be
the
full
definitive
hearing
that
the
final
investigation
resulted
in?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
what
basis?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
it
true
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
it
true
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
it
true
mr.
friedman
that
the
reason
there
are
no
findings
in
this
record
is
that
the
commission
made
none
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
and
you
now
concede
that
that
was
error.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
say
that
henceforth
you're
going
to
make
them
and
the
issue
before
us
is
upon
what
you're
going
to
make
them.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
whether
you're
going
to
have
to
do
it
on
affidavits
or
whether
you
got
to
have
a
full
definitive
hearing
first?
isn't
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
by
reshipping
rates,
do
you
mean
a
sort
of
a
transit
privilege?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
goods
have
to
be
necessarily
reloaded
to
another
car?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
is
not
throughout,
or
mr.
hayes,
are
they
not
in
fact
as
a
result
of
the
publication
and
filing
of
the
new
tariff?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
i'd
like
you
to
tell
me
why
you
wouldn't
be
just
(inaudible)
in
this
case
and
be
mooted
and
they
take
the
judgment
and
the
order
in
light
of
the
commission's
and
solicitor
general's
representations
-â€“
the
commission's
representations
that
the
practice
of
(inaudible)
and
that
henceforth
they
will
make
their
findings
before
they
issued
section
4,
why
wouldn't
that
do
you
everything
you
want?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
what
wouldn't
it
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
was
a
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that
would
be
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
may
be
another
case,
that
may
be
an
advice,
the
opinion
but
that's
a
--.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
shouldn't
have
done
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
that
another
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
true
--
i
asked
you
please.
if
we
could
read
the
representations
of
the
solicitor
general
and
the
icc
that
we
have
to
stop
this
practice,
if
we
believe
that
then,
isn't
the
case
moot?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
should
we
pronounce
that
type
of
matter
here
in
a
moot
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
not
a
--
wouldn't
be
if
we
accept
as
i
understand
you
to
--
the
representations
of
the
solicitor
general
that
this
practice
is
no
longer
to
be
followed
in
the
commission?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
didn't
conclude
in
my
assumption
in
the
hearings,
he
says
there
must
be
findings,
and
whatever
you
are
going
to
rest
those
findings
on,
is
another
day
perhaps,
but
he
agrees
this
is
order
is
bad.
and
he
says
they've
stopped
the
practice.
now
then,
what
would
be
tried
if
we
remanded
this
case
to
the
three-judge
court?
what
issue
would
there
be
to
that
effect?
