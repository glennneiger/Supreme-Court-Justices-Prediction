mr.
mr.

--
united
states.
mr.
hayes,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
you
may.
you
may
mr.
hayes.
mr.
friedman.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
why
wasn't
the
hearing
given?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
yes.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
but
we
don't
grant
a
hearing
after
we
--
after
we
affirm
it
such
as
they
do
on
the
commission.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
that
is
something
of
a
distinction
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
(voice
overlap)
process
in
there,
isn't
it?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
the
case
is
over
but
--
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
it
is
not
over.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
there's
a
little
difference
there,
isn't
it?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
you
mean
--
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
friedman,
may
i
ask
you
--
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
friedman,
what
is
the
first
stage
in
the
proceeding
where
the
commission
can
under
your
theory
grant
temporary
relief?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
now
is
there
--
is
there
â€“-
does
statute
provide
that
or
is
that
your
interpretation
of
the
law?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
alright.
now
let
me
ask
you
this
question
then,
if
it
--
if
you
must
--
if
they
must
wait
until
the
protest
is
put
in,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
they
granted
right
at
the
time
the
first
petition
is
filed
or
after
the
protest
if
they
can
decide
without
hearing
or
any
kind
of
proceedings
all
of
the
contested
facts
against
(inaudible)?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
well,
now
that's
kind
of
an
equivocal
statement.
it
seems
to
me
they
never
do
it
except
where
they
think
they
can.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
well,
now
let
me
ask
you
this,
in
this
case
there
were
contested
facts,
were
there
not?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
factual
issues.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
now,
those
undoubtedly
were
--
would
have
raised
an
issue
as
to
whether
they
could
affirm
it,
they
get
relief,
wouldn't
they?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
no,
just
--
would
you
answer
that
please?
did
they
or
they
didn't
they
raise
issues
of
that
importance?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
if
you
can't
answer
that,
why
if
they
didn't
would
they
--
would
they
grant
a
full
hearing
on
it?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
in
other
words,
they
decided
all
the
contested
issues
against
the
protestants
on
the
question
of
temporary
relief
and
then
left
them
for
14
months
or
whatever
time
that
might
elapse
between
them
and
the
final
order
to
lose
their
business
because
of
these
high
rates.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
yes,
and
the
question
was
rather
made
out,
how
do
you
make
that
out?
that's
--
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
that's
a
thing
that
bothers
me,
mr.
friedman,
if
they
can
decide
contested
issues
against
the
protestants
without
a
hearing,
without
any
evidence
of
any
kind,
i
do
not
see
what
good
it
does
to
wait
until
the
protest
is
entered,
might
just
as
well
do
it
on
the
petition
itself.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
oh,
i
was
just
going
to
say
and
would
you
attempt
to
differentiate
please
between
those
cases
that
where
there
is
a
contest
and
where
there
is
none.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
tolmie,
is
--
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
very
well.
mr.
tolmie.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
hayes.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
reread
it
please.
i'd
like
to
hear
it.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
hayes,
may
i
--
before
you
to
sit
down,
your
time
is
up,
but
before
you
sit
down,
would
you
answer
this
question
please.
when
the
railroads
restored
their
rates
which
is
--
this
claim
made
this
case
moot,
was
any
portion
of
the
order
of
the
commission
less
standing?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
would
you
mind
--
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
--
to
tell
us
--
telling
us
what
that
was
and
how,
if
at
all,
it
affects
your
case?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
does
the
fact
that
the
withdrawal
of
their
rates
leave
standing
that
portion
of
the
finding
of
the
commission
that
they
had
made
a
showing
that
entitles
them
to
consideration
under
section
4?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
do
that
--
does
that
affect
--
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
yes.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
because
didn't
they
have
to
make
some
kind
of
a
finding
first
if
there
were
special
circumstances
that
--
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
they
made
nothing?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
i
see.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
you
also
have
to
--
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
this
section
have
because
we
haven't
discuss
it,
the
proposition
that
when
you
sue
it
for
damages
under
the
abilene
doctrine,
it
will
have
to
be
sent
back
to
the
commission
to
determine
anew
on
the
facts,
whether
the
order
was
justified,
under
the
cases
we've
had.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
hayes,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
and
i
will
ask
the
same
question
with
mr.
friedman,
if
you
think
it
would
help
us
in
it,
i
need
to
have
the
original
petition,
the
protest
that
were
made
against
it
and
the
original
order
made
by
the
commission,
and
if
you
do
think
it
would
help
us,
would
there
be
any
objection
on
the
part
of
the
parties
to
making
them
available
to
us?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
yes.
but
if
we
said
because
it's
an
illegal
--
because
we
find
that
is
an
illegal
practice,
would
that
take
care
of
you?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
yes.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
thank
you,
mr.
hayes.
