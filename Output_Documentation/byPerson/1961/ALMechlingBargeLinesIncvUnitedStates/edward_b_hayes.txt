mr.
edward
b.
hayes
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
certain
water
carriers
authorized
and
certified
under
the
transportation
act
of
1940
to
move
grain
by
barge
from
northern
illinois
to
chicago
where
the
waterway
ends.
from
an
order
of
a
statutory
three-judge
court
dismissing
their
complaint,
they
appealed.
the
court
has
reserved
the
question
of
its
jurisdiction.
so
far
as
it
concerns
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
review
the
order
of
dismissal,
there
is
no
dispute
in
the
briefs
that
such
jurisdiction
does
exist
but
the
appellees
contend,
as
the
lower
court
held,
that
by
reason
of
certain
events
brought
about
solely
by
the
intervening
railroad
defendants
after
the
suit
had
been
pending
for
about
four
months,
which
i
shall
describe,
there
ceased
to
be
a
case
or
controversy
within
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
and
that
since
in
their
view,
judicial
power
to
grant
injunctive
relief
had
been
ousted,
there
was
no
judicial
power
to
grant
the
declaratory
relief
which
the
complaint
also
sought.
this
complaint
attacked
a
series
of
fore-orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
authorizing
the
rail
competitors
of
these
water
carrier
appellants
to
charge
lower
rates
for
longer
hauls,
attacked
those
fore-orders
as
instances
of
what
the
complaint
challenged
as
a
continuing
and
unlawful
practice
of
the
commission
to
enter
such
orders
authorizing
rates,
lower
rates
for
longer
haul
in
competition
with
water
carriers,
without
any
findings
of
fact
and
without
even
setting
the
date
for
the
hearing,
under
which
the
commission
contemporaneously
ordered
the
issues
of
fact
to
be
determined.
the
same
issues
of
fact
upon
which
the
correctness
of
its
order,
already
entered
depended.
the
commission's
answer
in
the
court
below
admitted
that
practice
on
both
counts,
the
absence
of
findings,
the
absence
of
a
hearing
when
the
order
was
entered
affecting
rights
immediately,
the
hearing
being
contemporarily
--
contemporaneously
ordered
to
decide
the
issues
on
which
the
order
depended,
it
defended
that
practice
as
entirely
lawful
in
every
respect,
both
with
respect
to
the
absence
of
findings
and
with
respect
to
the
hearing
point.
these
orders
which
are
thus
entered
in
that
way
by
admission
of
the
answer,
a
continuing
practice,
are
called
temporary
but
they
changed
the
status
quo.
the
last
for
months
or
years
they
are
final
legislative
acts
for
the
period
of
their
duration.
they
are
the
diametrical
opposite
of
the
relief
traditionally
granted
by
courts
of
chancery
to
preserve
the
status
quo
pending
a
hearing.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
for
14
months.
their
repetition
whittles
away
over
the
years
the
traffic
of
the
water
carriers
until
--
as
the
complaint
alleged,
the
affidavit
show
there
being
no
contrary
showing,
their
very
continuance
and
existence
in
the
trade
is
threatened.
this
is
a
comparatively
recent
practice
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i
have
before
me
a
photostat
of
page
52
of
the
64th
annual
report
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
of
the
year
1950,
printed
here
in
1951,
on
which
the
commission
says,
“frequently,
during
the
past
year,
we
have
had
occasion
to
consider
either
in
suspension
proceedings
or
fourth
section
application
cases,
these
are
both
section
application
cases,
rail
rates
reduced
to
meet
water
competition.
numerous
suspension
to
the
rates
resulted.
in
some
instances,
after
investigation,
the
reduced
rates
were
found
not
unreasonably
low.
in
others,
they
were
found
not
justified
and
required
to
be
cancelled,
and
then
this.
it
has
been
the
general
policy
of
the
commission
not
to
grant
any
relief
from
the
fourth
section
to
meet
water
competition
without
full
justification
at
a
hearing.”
that
was
the
policy
of
the
commission
as
of
1950.
the
policy
described
in
this
complaint,
and
which
i
have
just
described,
charged
in
that
complaint,
charged
more
over
as
being
the
continuing
practice
of
the
commission,
is
at
page
31
of
the
record
in
the
commission's
answer
filed
on
january
18,
1960,
defended
as
entirely
lawful
in
every
respect.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
lawful.
l-a-w-f-u-l,
lawful.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
contrary
as
that
practice
alleged
in
the
complaint
is
to
the
practice
described
in
this
report
of
1950.
this
complaint
attacked
these
orders
as
instances
of
that
recurring
practice
admitted
by
the
commission
to
be
the
practice,
admitted
to
be
recurring
and
defended
at
every
point
as
lawful
in
every
respect
averring
that
the
injury
which
the
commission's
order
did
not
deny
of
diverted
traffic
from
these
water
carriers
to
the
rail
carriers
by
these
lower
rates
--
lower
rail
rates
for
longer
hauls
was
not
legal
injury
because
it
resulted
solely
from
the
lawful
acts
of
the
commission.
the
acts
of
the
commission
being
those
which
i
have
described
and
their
lawfulness
being
challenged
on
the
grounds
i
have
stated.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
it
would
indicate
that
the
long-short
haul
differential
would
be
restored?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
oh,
your
honor
anticipates,
may
i
say
one
thing
before?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
--
well,
i
will
answer
your
honor's
question
now
because
that
the
--
which
you
want
to
know
now
i'm
going
to
answer
now.
after
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
the
lower
court
had
held,
after
the
litigation
had
been
pending
for
four
months,
that
the
railroads
by
withdrawing
their
application
for
this
fourth-section
relief,
no
further
order
having
been
entered
by
the
commission
that
these
temporary
orders
having
stood
meantime
that
the
rates
having
been
charged
in
the
meantime
and
the
injury
having
been
suffered
in
the
meantime.
the
railroads
by
withdrawing
their
application
for
fourth-section
relief
had
rendered
this
whole
controversy
one
on
which
there
was
no
power
in
the
federal
tribunal
to
grant
any
relief.
the
orders
were
not
withdrawn
of
the
commission.
they
simply
ceased
to
chart
that
kind
of
rates.
that
is
the
change
pending
the
litigation
to
which
i
referred,
and
which
i
said
i
would
describe,
brought
about
solely
by
the
action
of
the
railroads
themselves
which
is
contended
to
rebut
the
case
in
all
its
aspects,
both
with
respect
to
the
request
for
injunction,
also
for
declaratory
relief
beyond
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
it
was
in
that
aspect
that
the
court
below
sustained
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and
it
was
still
in
that
aspect
when
the
appellees,
the
commission,
and
the
intervening
railroads
asked
this
court
on
motion
for
an
outright
affirmance.
this
court,
however,
did
not
summarily
affirm.
now,
on
the
appellate
briefs
of
the
commission
in
this
court,
the
commission
says
--
by
counsel,
“as
to
the
feature
of
these
orders
which
consists
in
entering
them
without
findings,
we
have
changed
our
minds.
we
think
they
are
illegal.
but
as
to
the
feature
of
these
orders
which
consists
in
entering
them
before
the
hearings
are
held
which
the
commission
orders
in
order
to
inform
itself
on
the
issues
which
it
prejudges
in
the
order
it
has
already
entered,
we
think
these
orders
are
perfectly
lawful.”
and
the
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
commission,
as
--
i
don't
know
how
far
i'll
go
back.
the
commission
in
its
appellate
brief
here
says
it
has
changed
its
--
the
position
that
it
took
when
the
court
below
acted
with
respect
to
the
lawfulness
of
these
orders
insofar
as
they
are
entered
without
finding,
but
it
says,
“we
insist,
we
continue
to
insist
that
these
orders
are
perfectly
lawful
notwithstanding
that
they
have
been
entered
before
entering
upon
the
hearing
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
before
entering
upon
any
hearing,
hearings
that
--
whose
time
hadn't
been
even
set
at
the
time
when
the
commission
entered
these
orders,
hearings
to
determine
precisely
the
contested
issues
of
fact
upon
which
the
correctness
of
those
orders
already
entered
depended.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the--
it
was
not
granted
on
the
basis
of
any
showing.
it
was
granted
on
the
basis
of
the
railroad's
application
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
in
our
protest.
i
said
“hearing.”
i
hope
i
made
that
clear.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well,
it's
permanent
to
the
period
of
consideration
which
may
be
a
year
or
two.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
indeed.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
we
did.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
we
--
it
was
before
the
commission.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
a
wrongful
exercise.
i
think
yes.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no,
sir.
if
i
understand
you,
it
was
their
duty
not
to
act,
in
my
humble
opinion,
unless
and
until
they
had
done
what
was
needful
to
satisfy
themselves
in
a
lawful
way
of
the
outcome
of
issues
of
fact
that
had
been
made
before
them
in
a
pending
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
commission
does
not
have
power
to
do
what
it
did
here
and
describes
as
temporary
relief,
no.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
think
we
are
--
i
am
confused,
your
honor,
with
your
honor's
question
and
i
do
apologize.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
you
say
temporary
relief.
this
relief
lasts
for
years.
that's
just
im
--
just
a
word.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
and
lawyers
are
always
wrong.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
think
they
were
traveling
outside
both
their
statutory
and
their
constitutional
authority
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well,
for
one
thing,
we
live
in
illinois
and
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
beg
your
--
and
--
yes,
and
we
operate
that
and
in
illinois,
it
is
held
by
a
three-judge
court
that
passes
on
this
kind
of
thing
that
this
kind
of
an
order
is
not
reviewable
in
court.
we
tried,
as
the
record
shows,
in
a
previous
instance
of
precisely
this
kind
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
that's
what
the
court
held.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
and,
to
act
unconstitutionally
and
outside
the
statute
by
an
unreviewable
authority
is,
i
submit,
an
autho
--
anomaly
that
cannot
exist
and
which
this
court
has
rejected.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
--
my
statement
was
unreviewable
and
unconstitutional.
it's
--
i
quite
agree
that
an
unreviewable
authority
is
not
necessarily
an
unconstitutional
authority
but
if
that
authority
is
exercised
in
a
manner
that
is
unconstitutional,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
bound
to
be
reviewable
and
is
reviewable
and
is
reviewed.
but
we
couldn't
get
an
injunction
there.
other
courts
have
held
that
these
orders
are
reviewable.
we
don't
live
there.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no,
and
this
is
why,
because
the
commission
whenever
that
previously
has
been
attempted
with
respect
to
orders
by
--
in
other
circuits
where
there
were
injunctions
issued,
as
either
entered
a
final
order
before
they
could
be
reviewed
here
as
in
the
dixie
carrier's
case
or
else
the
railroads
have
withdrawn
their
applications.
and
so,
the
attempt
to
bring
the
case
here
has
been
largely
were
lost
so
far
as
bringing
about
a
correction
of
the
practice
--
the
recurring
practice
of
which
we
complain
and
which
continues
to
our
injury
without
ever
being
able
to
get
it
before
this
court
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
as
we
are
today.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
affidavits
show
five
instances
with
respect
to
this
very
traffic.
the
affidavits
show
also,
as
i
recall
it
in
a
particular
period,
nine
instances
between
april
9th,
1958,
this
is
record
54,
and
november
19th,
1959.
the
protest
of
nine
separate
and
distinct
fourth-section
relief
applications
in
which
temporary
and
quotes,
“fourth-section
relief
was
sought
and
obtained
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission.”
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
waterway
strait
bureau
of
which
this
carrier
is
one
of
the
members.
of
those
nine
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
sir.
this
is
the
same
traffic
that
was
involved
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
this
is
corn,
oats,
and
soybeans.
the
pre
--
the
earlier
case
involved
corn
and
wheat.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
sir,
that
is
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
sir,
and
the
injury
resulting
from
this
continual
whittling
away
of
water
carriers
traffic
is
in
the
case
of
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
one
after
another
of
this
temporary
of
so-called
order
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
thank
you.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
may
i
should
like
to
call
attention
to
the
report
of
the
late
great
joseph
b.
eastman
on
this
form
of
rail
rate
competition
with
water
carriers
which
shows
that
--
about
what
it
is,
a
means
of
financing
lower
rail
rate
competition
with
water
carriers
by
revenue
--
rail
revenue
derived
from
none
water
competitive
rail
transportation,
both
with
respect
to
the
short-haul
rate
and
the
great
reservoir
of
non-competitive
traffic
which
the
railroads
have
generally,
and
to
--
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
not
quite,
your
honor.
and
may
i
refer
directly
to
that
having
said
what
i
have
said.
the
solicitor
general’s
concession
is
put
in
a
form
which
is
confusingly
broader
than
any
issue
that
is
presented
in
this
case.
let
me
lead
up
to
that
if
i
may,
i
referred
to
the
fact
that
after
insisting
in
the
lower
court
on
the
validity
of
the
commission's
procedures
in
all
respects,
both
with
respect
to
the
necessity
of
findings
and
also
with
respect
to
the
necessity
of
hearings
before
on
a
contested
issue
or
uncontested
issues,
a
binding
order
is
made
without
giving
the
hearing
that
the
commission
admitted
the
needs
because
it
orders
one
--
insisted
in
the
lower
court
on
the
validity
of
its
procedures
on
both
those
points,
then
the
solicitor
general
concedes
that
as
to
the
necessity
of
findings
--
it,
the
commissioner,
has
for
some
years
been
following
a
practice
which
is
contrary
to
law.
that
admission
is
made
in
very
broad
terms.
but
the
insistencies
that
there
should
be
no
consideration
as
to
whether
the
commission
has
not
also
been
following
a
procedure
for
years.
some
few
years
last
past
that
is
contrary
to
law
with
respect
to
the
necessity
of
those
hearings
in
these
circumstances.
it
is
in
these
circumstances
that
we
urge
that
findings
are
necessary
and
that
hearings
are
necessary.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no
sir,
he
did
not
concede
that
hearings
were
necessary.
he
conceded
only
that
findings
were
necessary,
and
asked
that
this
court
not
even
consider
whether
the
commission
had
not
also
been
departing
from
legally
required
procedures
with
respect
to
the
necessity
of
hearings.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
that
sir
is
my
position.
he
does
not
concede
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
asked
this
court
not
to
pass
on
that
point,
but
to
allow
the
commission
to
proceed
without
review
on
the
short-term
orders
which
have
so
long
escaped
preview
by
the
means
that
i
described
yesterday.
changing
the
situation
when
the
immediate
practice
--
immediate
instance
of
the
unlawful
practice
is
the
same.
that
is
the
essence
of
this
case.
it
is
the
recurrent
nature
of
these
illegalities
in
short-term
orders
escaping
review
that
makes
it
necessary
for
that
to
be
a
review
here
against
the
contention
that
there
is
no
longer
any
controversy
because
the
particular
instance
of
the
unlawful
practices
(a)
findings
--
no
findings,
(b)
no
hearing
has
lapsed
by
virtue
of
something
engineered
for
the
railroad
defendants.
this
court
said
in
the
southern
pacific
terminal
cases,
i
cannot
put
my
argument
in
better
language
than
that
of
the
court
in
that
case.
the
questions
involved
in
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
now
usually
continuing
as
are
manifestly
those
in
the
case
at
bar.
and
their
consideration
ought
not
to
be
as
they
might
be
defeated
by
short-term
orders
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review,
that
at
one
time
the
government
and
in
another
time
the
carriers,
have
their
right
determined
by
the
commission
without
a
chance
of
regress.
there
was
a
situation
in
which
the
order
before
the
commission,
had
order
of
the
commission
had
expired
by
its
terms.
it
had
been
entered
for
two
years
only,
and
the
two
years
were
up
and
the
argument
of
the
commission
was
there
as
yet,
but
the
case
was
moot.
that
was
the
answer
that
this
court
returned
in
a
situation
of
short-term
orders
that
goes
straight
to
the
circumstances
of
this
existing
continuing
controversy.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
your
honor,
i
think
he
does.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
say
that
the
findings
of
fact
are
necessary
and
yet,
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
hold
the
hearing
which
the
commission
admittedly
the
needs
to
make
those
findings
which
are
to
be
decisive
of
its
action,
before
it
takes
action,
binding
action,
action
that
can't
be
collaterally
attacked
that
continues
for
years,
although
it's
called
temporary
while
the
hearings
are
postponed.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
an
impossible
position.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
thank
you
for
raising
that.
let
me
urge
the
point
that
i
have
made
in
my
brief.
these
so-called
temporary
orders
are
the
diametrical
opposite
of
the
relief
traditionally
granted
by
chancery
to
maintain
the
status
quo
pending
the
hearing.
these
so-called
temporary
orders
changed
the
status
quo.
at
once
before
the
hearing
by
a
determination
on
findings
now
admitted
to
be
necessary
are
precisely
the
issues
on
which
any
such
binding
order,
changing
status
quo,
injury
and
immediate
injury
of
one
of
the
parties
would
have
to
depend.
it's
hard
to
concede
how
anyone
could
defend
that
kind
of
a
practice.
it
is
just
reminiscent
of
the
famous
trial
in
lewis
carroll's
satire
which
the
order
of
procedure
was,
“sentence
first,
verdict
afterwards.”
it
turns
it
upside
down.
no
one
would
imagine
that
when
the
commission
goes
to
congress
and
says,
“we
always
give
a
man
a
hearing
if
he
has
a
proper
interest.”
what
they
mean
is
that
they
dispose
off
his
interests
right
at
the
outset
merely
on
pleadings.
and
then
so
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
the
hearing
is
long
postponed.
and
the
results
of
the
government
says
sometimes,
“in
a
change
of
the
order
which
had
forced
those
issues
apparently
when
the
case
was
first
submitted
on
the
pleadings.”
now,
i
say
the
government's
concession
with
respect
to
the
necessity
of
those
findings
rarely
carries
with
it
a
concession
of
the
necessity
of
having
a
hearings.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
thank
you.
the
hearing
that
is
required
in
order
to
maintain
that
basic
standard
of
fairness
which
due
process
requires
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
depends
certainly
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
have
not
said
so
your
honor.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
your
honor,
i
am
--
with
submission
beginning
by
urging
that
the
commission's
concession
of
the
necessity
of
findings
is
confusingly
far
broader
than
the
issue
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
here,
bear
with
me.
here
is
a
case
in
which
the
railroads
ask
an
order
to
divert
from
these
water
carriers
the
traffic
they're
moving.
they
asked
that
order
on
the
basis
of
papers
that
they
have
spent
months
on
amassing,
interested,
tendentious,
disputed
data.
the
water
carrier
is
given
15
days
to
get
something
on
file
on
washington,
all
he
can
do
is
to
put
an
issue
the
events
that
the
railroads
have
made.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
water
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
that's
a
melon
color
reflection
to
your
honors,
to
the
length
of
that
time.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
they
had
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
your
honor,
i
make
no
protestation
of
perfection
for
any
human
being,
but
again
bear
with
me.
no
one
can
prepare
a
showing
to
meet
a
showing
that
has
been
prepared
for
months
in
15
days,
it
can't
be
done.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
this
case
your
honor
here
is,
one,
in
which
the
concession
of
the
necessity
of
findings
in
every
case
is
so
broad
that
as
it
was
--
is
put,
it
would
include
the
necessity
of
findings
even
in
an
uncontested
case,
even
in
a
case
where
there
is
no
effort
on
the
part
of
the
railroads
to
do
anything
but
protect
traffic
which
they
already
have.
there
--
even
where
the
protest
is
filed
by
one
who
has
no
profit
interest,
even
where
the
protest
is
--
there
should
be
findings
as
i
suppose
as
to
the
interest
to
show
why
no
hearing
is
granted
even
then,
under
this
concession.
but
there
--
it
is
so
broad
as
to
include
every
kind
of
a
fourth
section
proceeding.
now
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
that
was
not
the
matter
to
which
i
was
addressing
for
myself
your
honor.
if
i
understand.
it
is
true
that,
that
concession
as
so
phrased
is
one
on
which
the
commission
may
change
its
mind.
in
fact,
if
the
commission
in
the
subsequent
proceeding
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
erroneously
made,
then
perhaps
it
would
be
its
duty
to
change
its
mind.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
provided
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
provided
--
but
--
well,
i
suppose
they
have
their
views
on
due
process.
unless,
they
have
been
confronted
with
a
determination
by
this
court
that
according
to
their
concession,
today,
according
to
our
contention,
according
to
the
decisions
of
two
or
three
judge
courts.
it
is
necessary
that
there
should
be
findings,
constitutionally
necessary
that
there
should
be
findings
for
that
necessity
of
findings
is
placed
by
this
court
upon
fundamental
principles
of
constitutional
government.
and
that
quotation
your
honor
will
recognize
as
from
panama
refining
company
against
ryan
and
mahler
against
eby.
those
are
constitutional
necessities
of
findings
which
they
now
recognize
and
which
they
now
say
they
have
not
been
observing
in
their
procedures
for
the
protection
of
water
carriers,
a
protection
which
was
enjoined
on
them
by
congress.
and
surely
if
by
short-term
orders
they
can
for
many
years
fail
to
give
to
the
water
carriers
protections
which
are
as
this
court
has
said
required
by
fundamental
principles
of
constitutional
government
in
one
respect.
it
should
have
the
consideration
of
this
court
as
to
whether
they
have
not
been
giving
less
than
that
constitutional
protection
in
the
other
respect.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i'm
not
sufficiently
informed
to
make
a
statement
on
that.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
do
know
that
in
some
fourth
section
application
cases
they
do
make
findings.
but
in
the
fourth
section
application
cases
of
these
water
carriers,
we
have
not
been
getting
them
in
any
of
these
cases
that
i
have
here
described.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
know
of
none,
and
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no,
none
has
been
cited.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
and
in
that
connection,
i
should
like
if
i
might
--
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
i
have
the
--
from
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
understand.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
understand.
there
is
material
in
our
reply
brief
on
that
your
honor,
a
material
from
the
congressional
record.
the
number
is
very
great
and
in
practically
none
of
them
is
there
any
protest
by
anybody.
now,
we
don't
contend
that
in
a
default
proceeding,
the
commission
must
have
a
trial
to
make
findings.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
but
the
interests
of
parties
which
are
controlled
by
the
law
as
--
are
their
rights.
our
rights
and
interests
which
under
the
constitution,
they
have
a
right
to
be
fairly
heard
of
before
those
rights
are
taken.
i
would
refer
on
the
necessity
and
the
kind
of
case
where
there
is
a
necessity
for
an
adversary
hearing,
the
(inaudible)
hearing
to
the
case
of
hannah
against
larche
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief
in
which
this
court
made
plain
that
where
an
order
is
to
be
entered
now
that
directly
affects
the
legal
rights
of
parties.
there,
those
procedures
which
judicial
experience
have
shown
are
necessary
to
a
fair
opportunity
to
be
heard
are
required
by
due
process
of
law.
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
if
i
have
any.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
should
have
to
talk
fast
in
the
few
minutes
remaining.
the
large
part
has
been
made
of
the
circumstance,
if
we
tried
to
get
our
relief
before
the
commission
by
hearing
that
without
going
into
court,
to
set
this
order
aside.
we
did
try.
we
did
not
get
our
hearing.
we
did
not
get
our
relief.
the
hearings
were
finally
set,
then
they
were
reopened,
then
they
were
combined
with
other
things,
all
on
the
motion
of
the
railroads.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
over
our
protest,
a
period
of
10
months.
and
why
didn't
we
go
into
court
immediately?
your
honor,
we
did
go
into
court
immediately
in
the
preceding
situation
which
is
described
in
the
record.
it
didn't
get
us
anywhere.
there
have
been
other
attempts
to
get
correction
in
court
and
when
the
correction
is
sought,
the
rates
are
withdrawn,
the
court
has
told
there's
no
controversy,
and
the
same
thing
happens
right
over
again
a
few
months
later
and
the
instances
--
of
nine
of
these
instances
in
the
period
of
less
than
a
year
are
detailed
in
the
record
in
this
case
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
any
time
(voice
overlap)
--
may
i
finish
my
thought
your
honor.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
a
determination
of
any
particular
instance
of
that
can
always
be
engineered
in
just
this
way.
we
observed
that
it
is.
we
should
spend
what
money
we've
got
left
in
going
into
court
proceedings
that
aren't
going
to
do
us
any
good.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
if
i
don't
get
relief
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
but
the
point
is,
your
honor,
that
they
are
now
saying
in
this
court
are
they
not,
here
we
can't
get
relief
in
this
court
because
the
matter
is
moot.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
your
honor
--
no
words
can
express
my
gratitude
for
that
fact.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes.
professor
sharpman
(ph)
does
not
endorse
this
practice.
this
is
not
an
inveterate
practice
of
73
years
standing.
i
quote
from
professor
sharpman
(ph),
page
245
volume
3,
“but
the
applicant
is
required
to
--,”
and
that's
the
railroad,
“is
required
to
state
whether
a
hearing
is
or
is
not
desired
and
it
is
the
uniform
practice
of
the
commission
to
hold
hearings
upon
the
request
of
any
party.”
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
that
was
1937.
i
--
he
refers
to
the
original
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
think
they
cite
it
in
there.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
thus
submitted
the
applications
are
disposed
off
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
after
investigation
and
recommendation
by
the
fourth
section's
board,
but
the
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
may
i
read
the
second
sentence
in
its
context
please?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
did
read
--
finished
it.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
thought
i
had.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
may
i
re-read
your
honor.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
“on
the
basis
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
thus
submitted,
applications
are
disposed
off
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
after
investigation
and
recommendation
by
the
fourth
section
board
without
formal
proceedings,”
that's
a
great
majority
of
instances.
this
is
the
next
sentence,
“but
the
applicant
is
required
to
state
whether
a
hearing
is
or
is
not
desired,
and
it
is
the
uniform
practice
of
the
commission
to
hold
hearings
upon
the
request
of
any
interested
party."
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
pardon?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
there
was
such
a
request
here
your
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
a
hearing
was
scheduled
after
the
order
was
made
that
disposed
off
our
rights.
now,
their
suggestion
is
that
our
rights
can
be
disposed
off
for
14
months
without
a
hearing,
“sentence
was
first,
verdict
afterward.”
that
has
not
been
the
procedure
of
the
commission
and
there
has
been
no
communication
to
congress
to
that
effect.
i
quote
from
the
1950
report
of
the
commission,
published
here
in
1951.
frequently,
during
the
past
year,
we
have
had
occasion
to
consider
either
in
suspension
proceedings
of
fourth
section
application
cases,
rail
rates
reduced
to
meet
water
competition.
numerous
suspensions
of
the
rates
resulted.
in
some
instances
after
investigation,
the
reduced
rates
were
found
not
unreasonable
below.
in
others
they
were
found
not
justified
and
required
to
be
cancelled.
it
has
been
the
general
policy
of
the
commission
not
to
grant
any
relief
from
the
fourth
section
to
meet
water
competition
without
full
justification
of
the
hearing.
this
is
a
new
practice.
it
is
not
the
inveterate
practice
since
18
--
the
first
rules
of
the
commission
provided
that
the
first
thing
that
would
be
done
in
the
fourth
section
application
was
filed
was
to
set
the
date
for
the
hearing.
that's
quoted
in
the
next
page
on
sharpman
(ph)
from
which
i
read.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
can't
see
how
it
does
and
yet
that
is
urged,
your
honor,
and
seems
to
have
weight.
and
perhaps
it
may
have
some
significance
that
this
is
a
practice
which
has
come
in
only
since
1950.
and
is
not
the
inveterate
practice
which
congress
has
presumed
to
have
sanctioned
by
its
acquiescence
at
all.
then,
it
is
suggested
that
we
can
make
a
showing
to
the
commission
in
opposition
to
an
application,
an
application
which
is
made
in
a
case
which
was
described
from
the
bench
as
very
difficult
and
complicated.
the
case
in
which
we
are
expected
to
meet
a
mass
of
tendentious
data
which
we
dispute
as
to
which
we
raised
contested
issues
of
fact,
issues
that
we
can
only
present
on
a
hearing
when?
15
days
will
not
give
a
man
an
opportunity
to
what
relief
against
him,
to
his
opponent
that
takes
his
property
that
is
going
to
be
in
effect
for
14
months
particularly
when
that
same
thing
can
be
done
again
and
again
and
again.
i'm
tempted
to
say
a
famous
quotation,
“indeed
it
can.
indeed
it
is.”
this
complaint
says
that
it
is.
this
complaint
is
admitted
as
to
its
factual
averments.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no,
sir.
you
don't
get
those
extensions.
furthermore,
after
the
railroads
have
amassed
this
material,
you
come
in
with
what
you
can
do
in
15
days
then
the
railroads
have
another
10
days
to
reply,
and
you
can
make
your
agenda
to
that
reply.
that
is
not
what
courts
of
equity
do.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
hearings
were
not
set
until
months
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
after
the
order
was
entered,
but
were
held
the
order
having
been
entered
on
the
date
stated.
the
hearings
were
held
in
july.
the
hearings
were
then
concluded,
and
the
record
closed
then
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
had
not
been
set,
when
they
entered
the
order.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
there
were
delays
in
concluding
the
hearing.
they
are
set
forth
in
detail.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
not,
and
it
did
not
occur
until
the
following
july.
and
i
know
that
it
was
reopened
then.
and
i'm
perfectly
clear
that
there
were
delays
of
those
hearings
over
our
objection
at
the
instance
of
the
railroad
applicants.
that
is
detailed
in
our
complaint,
these
names,
dates,
times,
and
places.
that
is
not
what
courts
of
equity
do.
what
courts
of
equity
do
is
to
issue
orders,
not
to
change
the
status
quo,
based
on
determination
of
the
contested
issues
before
it.
but
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
they
issued
those
orders
to
maintain
the
status
quo
until
there
was
a
hearing.
this
is
the
diametrical
opposite.
it
changes
the
status
quo
before
the
hearing
and
even
with
respect
to
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo,
a
court
of
equity
as
pointed
out
from
the
bench
will
require
at
the
instance
of
any
party
that
if
it
has
entered
an
order
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
generally
done
only
under
bond
to
protect
damages
but
if
it
is
entered
that
order
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
then
the
parties
must
proceed
promptly
to
that
hearing
upon
the
merits.
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo
protected
by
bond
against
damages
with
the
requirement
of
immediate
proceeding,
the
hearing
on
the
merits,
is
not
the
same
as
this
changed
the
status
quo.
and
the
ultimate
contested
issues
without
anything
to
protest
damages,
that
continues
--
yes,
we
could
go
into
court
perhaps,
they'd
withdraw
their
application
and
just
as
they
did
here,
they've
done
it
many
times
before
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
we'd
be
up
against
the
same
thing.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes.
and
not
by
refusing
to
permit
them
to
withdraw
their
application
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
but
that
--
except
for
that
circumstances
as
just
what
the
court
below
should
have
done
and
didn't
do
in
which
we
asked
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
but
certainly,
it
had
under
the
southern
pacific
case
which
is
undistinguishable
from
this
one.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
that
was
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes
sir.
this
order
of
the
commission
is
now
admittedly
an
unlawful
order.
it
is
an
order
that
authorizes
the
railroads
to
charge
those
lower
rates
for
longer
hauls
that
did
us
this
damage.
now,
the
order
is
admitted
to
be
unlawful
by
the
commission,
but
it
is
not
admitted
to
be
unlawful
by
the
railroads.
if
we
proceed
against
the
railroads
whose
brief
prefers
only
to
section
8
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
by
the
way,
is
necessary
also
to
read
section
9
giving
us
the
right
to
proceed
in
court
we
choose,
if
we
proceed
against
the
railroads,
then
they
who
have
not
admitted
the
invalidity
of
this
order
will
say
to
the
court,
these
people
are
trying
to
recover
against
us
for
doing
something
which
an
outstanding
order
of
the
commission
authorizes
us
to
do,
that
under
the
(inaudible)
case
is
absolutely
out
of
order.
the
only
place
that
we
can
get
relief
against
that
order
so
that
we
may
recover
our
damages
is
in
this
direct
review.
indeed,
the
government
substantially
conceded
that
suggesting
some
sort
of
an
exception
for
this
case,
as
the
court
remarked,
the
court
is
not
a
counsel.
and
the
lower
court
will
not
concur
if
the
railroads
can't
help
it
in
that
view,
and
the
commission
won't
be
a
party
there,
the
railroads
only
will.
therefore,
it
stands
as
a
bar
until
this
court
strikes
it
down
on
this
direct
review
to
our
recovery
of
damages
which
were
unlawfully
authorized
and
were
unlawful
rates.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well,
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
commission
didn't
--
forgive
me
your
honor.
it
--
let
me
answer
what
i
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
commission
didn't
make
that
finding.
all
the
commission
said
was,
the
rates
are
authorized
and
you
can
charge,
and
that
is
left
standing.
i
think
that's
what
you
inquired
upon.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
they
made
none
at
all.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
they
made
none,
and
in
that
respect,
they
admit
here
the
order
was
an
unlawful
order.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
and
there,
that
unlawful
stands,
the
unlawful
order
stands
to
bar
us
from
collecting
the
damages
which
we
suffered
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
from
the
unlawful
rates
which
it
unlawfully
offered.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
but
your
honor,
the
railroads
don't.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
and
unless
this
order
is
vacated,
then
the
railroads
against
whom
we
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no
sir,
they
do
not.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no
sir,
the
order
authorize
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
how
about
the
damages
we
suffered
in
the
meantime
with
that
order
authorized?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
that
is
going
to
be
an
issue
if
as
and
when
this
court
sets
that
order
aside,
and
we
sue
the
railroads
for
charging
those
rates
without
a
lawful
commission
authority,
until
this
court
sets
it
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
we
lost
money
through
all
that
time.
and
our
affidavit
showed
heavy
losses.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
only
consequence
that
i
recall
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
your
honor,
knows
a
great
deal
more
about
that
than
i
am
but
if
i
may
respond
to
the
suggestion,
the
only
thing
that
gets
vacated
is
an
underlying
legal
document
that
i
recall
in
those
circumstances,
is
the
order
of
the
lower
court.
you
don't
vacate
the
order
of
the
commission,
the
order
of
the
commission
is
still
there.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well,
its
--
it's
--
i
--
your
honor,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
to
you
is
–
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
do
not
agree
with
you.
i
should
think
you'd
like
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
and
unless
something
is
done
to
set
that
aside,
the
railroads
who
--
to
act
on
that.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
railroads
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well,
if
you
say
that
in
a
binding
way
that
binds
the
railroads
in
our
subsequent
litigation,
then
you
have
given
me
a
present,
but
not
if
you
dismiss
this
case
as
moot.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
that
argument
would
be
made.
we
think
there's
a
good
answer,
if
this
order
is
set
aside
under
the
american
union
coal
company
case
cited
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
as
the
beginning
in
156
federal
and
many
others.
but
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
we
ought
to
have
a
right
to
present
those
issues
to
the
court
on
bar
by
an
order
unencumbered
and
unclogged
by
an
order
which
is
admitted
by
the
commission
to
be
an
unlawful
one.
the
railroads
also
admitted
that
is
what
they're
going
to
use
when
we
take
them
in.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
there
is
absolutely
nothing
that
this
court
has
any
interest
in
that
i
don't
have
the
greatest
desire
to
have
this
court
have.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
original
order
of
the
commission
is
a
part
of
this
record.
it's
alleged
in
the
admitted
complaint,
the
series
of
four
orders
just
the
same
like
soldiers
at
rest
and
just
as
unlawful
form,
admittedly
unlawful
form,
that
is
part
of
the
record,
and
our
complaint
thus
set
forth
that
we
file
the
protest
here
alleging
that
those
rates
were
destructive.
it's
threatened
the
extinction
of
legitimate
water
competition
and
were
lower
than
necessary
certainly
to
meet
legitimate
water
competition.
and
counsel
for
the
government
conceded
in
his
argument
that
that
goes
to
whether
or
not
it
is
a
reasonably
compensatory
rail
rate.
it
reasonably
it
goes
two
ways,
that
is
before
the
court
and
anything
more
the
court
desires
for
me,
i
desire
affirmance.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
is
it
the
same
long-haul
rates?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
and
we
can
attack
them
now
only
on
the
basis
that
they
are
unreasonable
under
section
1.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
we
attack
them
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
not
anymore.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
when
we
could
attack
them
now
only
under
section
1.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
record
shows
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
old
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well,
those
are
put
in
under
this
fourth
section
application.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
long-haul
rates
that
are
now
in
effect
were
those
that
were
put
down
to
their
present
level
as
a
result
of
this
fourth
section
order.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
certainly
it
would
enable
us
to
recover
our
damages.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
certainly
it
would
not
do
this
your
honor.
it
would
not
give
us
the
right
to
have
a
hearing
before
the
commission,
the
body
appointed
by
congress
to
hear
the
facts
and
judge
the
issues
on
which
our
rights
depend.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
before
--
if
you
include
in
that,
a
requirement
that
they
shall
not
only
make
findings
but
before
they
make
a
binding
order,
they
shall
give
us
a
chance
to
be
heard
as
we
put
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
that
would
give
us
all
we
want.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
that's
this
case
because
we
attacked
that
practice
in
this
case,
not
only
the
failure
to
make
findings,
but
the
failure
to
give
us
a
hearing
before
they
cut
our
heads
off.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
and
they
do
it
again
tomorrow?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
assuming
they
are
in
good
faith,
unless
this
court
binds
them
to
that
practice,
then
if
their
views
changes
to
what
the
law
requires
in
good
faith,
they
would
be
bound
to
change
their
practice.
it's
only
this
court's
directive
that
they
dragged,
with
this
court's
directive
they
must
follow
the
law.
otherwise,
with
these
short-term
orders,
there
is
a
no
man's
land
of
uncontrolled
administrative
action.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no
sir.
if
you
believe
that
the
representations
of
the
solicitor
general
to
that
this
was
an
unlawful
order,
then
i
presume
if
you
so
hold
an
opinion,
you
will
have
--
stop
the
practice.
but
the
belief
of
the
representation
of
a
public
officer
as
to
what
is
lawful,
i
am
challenged
--
the
solicitor
general's
integrity
on
that
at
all.
it
does
not
bind
the
administrative
agency.
it
does
not
even
bind
his
successor.
there
will
be
nothing
to
prevent
this
same
practice
from
going
on
even
immediately
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
case
is
not
moot
your
honor.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
if
you
say
that
it's
illegal
because
we
find
it
an
illegal
practice
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
then
that
does
my
business
with
respect
both
to
the
findings
and
the
failure
to
give
a
hearing
before
they
could
argue
it.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
don't
know.
the
only
issues
are
concluded
so
far
as
they
are
factual
issues
by
the
admissions
of
the
complaint
and
the
showings
of
the
affidavit.
there
may
be
some.
but
your
honor,
may
i
urge
this,
the
questions
involved
in
the
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
are
usually
continuing
and
these
questions
are
manifestly
continuing
and
their
consideration
ought
not
to
be
as
they
might
be
defeated
by
short
term
orders
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review,
and
at
one
time,
the
one
party,
and
at
one
time
the
other,
have
his
rights
determined
without
a
chance
of
regress,
unless
you
settle
these
matters.
then
the
short
term
orders
will
be
recurrent.
they
will
be
recurrent
not
because
the
solicitor
general
is
in
bad
faith
on
the
question
of
the
necessity
of
findings.
they
will
be
recurrent
because
the
commission
doesn't
agree
with
it
or
because
he
changes
his
mind
or
at
any
case,
because
this
court
has
not
settled
the
right
of
the
parties,
the
question
that
needs
to
be
solved.
and
as
pointed
out
from
the
bench
on
the
other
point,
the
necessity
of
hearings,
that
is
question
b
in
this
case,
just
as
much
this
case
as
the
question
of
the
necessity
of
findings.
that's
that.
that's
in
the
complaint.
and
on
that,
we
think,
we
are
entitled
to
be
heard
before
it
rule
is
off
with
our
heads.
