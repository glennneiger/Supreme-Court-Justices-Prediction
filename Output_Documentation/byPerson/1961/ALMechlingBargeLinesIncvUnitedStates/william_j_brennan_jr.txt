mr.
friedman,
may
i
ask
--
i
gather
if
someone
protested
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
also
submits
something,
does
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
when
you
do
come,
would
you
tell
me
what
is
the
situation
where
issues
of
facts
may
perhaps
arise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see,
that's
5
years,
5%,
well,
that's
300
over
five
years
of
protested
application?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
about
60
years
on
average,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
i
misunderstood
you
to
--
i
thought
you
said
when
a
hearing
is
requested,
it's
granted
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
the
hearing
is
requested
on
a
temporary
--
on
an
applications
for
temporary
order
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
no
hearing
is
given.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
exactly
what
did
you
rely
on
in
other
words,
before
the
temporary
order
was
issued?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
be
anything,
what
was
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
take,
it
was
lower.
the
reshipping
rate
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
what
it
had
to
charge
with
the
ex-rail
cargoes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hayes,
i
think
you've
mentioned
earlier
that
there
have
been
several
continuances
of
the
hearing
date.
can
you
shortly
give
me
the
--
what
the
chronology
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
many
months?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
but
that's
--
this
is
where
we're
getting
at.
i
think
you
said
earlier
that
in
this
particular
case,
a
hearing
date
hadn't
been
set.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
but
when
was
that
entered?
that
date
was
continued
--
i
thought
you
said
several
times
before
the
hearing
was
finally
held
and
it
continued
on
each
case
on
application
of
the
railroad.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
take
up
your
few
seconds,
was
the
hearing
begun
on
the
date
originally
scheduled
for
the
hearing
to
begin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
except
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
mr.
hayes,
if
we
get
over
the
mootness
point,
the
government
concedes
that
this
particular
order
has
to
be
vacated.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
railroads
don't
join
the
government
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
long-haul
rates
that
were
constituted
by
this
temporary
order
are
now
in
effect
and
have
been
in
effect,
they
were
sustained
temporarily.
