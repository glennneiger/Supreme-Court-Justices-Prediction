justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
hayes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
state
--
is
this
a
part
of
the
continuing
fight
with
connection
with
barge
carriers
and
railroad
carriers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
same
traffic.
what
is
--
what
is
this
carrier?
what
is
this
carrier?
is
this
wheat
or
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
the
commission
--
i
don't
quite
understand
this
myself.
are
you
saying
that
the
commission
has
now
--
are
you
charging
the
commission
has
now
devised
a
claim
under
which,
by
giving
a
lot
of
temp
--
so-called
temporary
permits
as
to
rates
and
then
withdrawing
them
when
--
as
to
whether
they
could
be
reviewed
that
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
carrier
withdraw
them,
or
whatever
it
is
that
thereby
the
barges
are
being
compelled
to
lose
their
vendors
because
by
this
device
the
railroads
are
permitted
to
undercut
them,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
barges
are
by
that
means
and
by
that
device,
losing
the
benefit
that
congress
said
they
should
have
by
reason
of
the
inherent
difference
between
the
cost
of
railroad
and
barge
transportation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
whittling
away
by
this
method
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
temporary
of
something,
it
keeps
it
going
so
that
it
can't
be
challenged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
orders
by
the
commission
with
railroads
uphold
where
they
held
enough
for
a
year,
a
year
and
a
half
over
the
protest
of
the
railroads
such
temporary
action
as
they
took
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
anybody
cited
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
i
do
not
want
to
interrupt
what
you're
saying,
but
i
want
to
find
out,
are
you
representing
the
commission
here
or
are
you
representing
the
government
in
the
concession
you
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
commission
admits
that
the
practice
it
had
--
it
has
heretofore
had
in
connection
with
this
order
is
unlawful.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
your
statement
you
have
about
the
commission
and
the
temporary
hearing.
do
you
say
the
application
does
not
ask
for
temporary
relief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
the
commission
know
then
that
they
want
temporary
relief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
does
that
mean
temporary
relief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it
means
permanent
but
i
do
not
understand
how
the
commission
would
act
on
it
if
they
didn't
let
them
know
that
they
wanted
some
relief
right
away.
i
now
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
en
banc
for
the
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
is
that
what
you
were
saying?
are
you
saying
if
the
commission
suspects
from
an
application
that
these
people
might
be
imported
or
they
might
want
--
these
people
might
want
relief
immediately
without
a
hearing
or
that
the
commission
does
automatically
of
itself
picks
it
up
and
does
it
without
anybody
suggesting
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
understood
him
to
say
--
are
you
saying
if
they
do
it
when
it's
suspecting
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
want
to
find
out
--
what
i
want
to
find
out
here
and
i
suppose
it
must
be
true
whether
or
not
the
commission
acts
--
whether
or
not
the
people
who
want
temporary
relief
actually
asked
it
either
in
words
which
say
we
want
temporary
relief
instantly
under
section
4
or
we
want
temporary
relief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
do
i
understand
that
you're
saying
for
the
commission,
these
people
do
not
ask
for
temporary
relief
in
such
mystical
or
subtle
language
as
they
desire?
but
that
they
do
not
ask
for
temporary
relief
and
this
is
a
matter
that
the
commission
takes
up
on
its
own
motion
because
they
think
they
ought
to
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
railroads
in
this
case
or
whoever
did
this
ask
for
temporary
relief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
did
they
ask
for
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
if
it
is
crucial
in
the
case
but
i
--
and
when
you
ask
for
temporary
injunction,
ordinarily,
the
statute
which
requires
that
there's
a
limitation
at
the
time
that
temporary
injunction
can
be
granted
and
even
in
states
where
they
provide
that
temporary
injunction
can
be
granted
as
a
rule
as
i
recall
it
for
a
limited
time.
but
they
asked
for
it
and
as
justice
whittaker,
indicated
they
give
some
kind
of
showing
as
to
why
they
should
have
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
only
in
the
rarest
instances
as
i
recall
that
they
grant
it
for
over
a
period
of
a
certain
number
of
days
without
giving
the
other
side
a
right
to
be
heard.
do
they
have
any
such
rules
at
the
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
usually,
these
types
are
frequently
very
complicated
and
take
several
years,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there's
no
hearing
before
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
a
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
findings
from
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
findings
from
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
water
carriers
authorize
and
notified
of
this
when
they're
filing
the
papers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
temporarily.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
did
they
ask
for
a
hearing
on
it?
or
did
they
offer
anything?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
permanent
hearing
--
now
for
a
permanent
â€“
will
they
given
the
chance
to
offer
any
affidavits
in
connection
with
its
temporary
order
which
state
in
effect
how
long?
justice
hugo
l.
black
right.
were
they
given
any
opportunity
or
did
they
offer
any
affidavits
on
that
temporary
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
were
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
given
an
opportunity
to
do
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
(inaudible)
--
i'm
not
talking
here
about
permanent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
i'm
interested
in
now
is
temporary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
all
we're
talking
about
here,
all
they
have
here
is
one
that
was
granted
on
temporary
relief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
possible
to
confine
it
to
that
so
that
we
can
find
out
just
what
was
done
in
connection
with
the
action
for
temporary
relief
which
lasted
14
months.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
one
other
issue,
isn't
it?
you
had
there
a
question
where
they
were
challenging
not
your
permanent
owner
because
you
didn't
make
any.
that
was
--
the
commission
made
that
moot
by
its
action
after
they
attacked
them
on
the
ground,
they
had
created
a
device
of
subterfuge
to
keep
from
giving
water
carriers
the
advantage
of
that
which
congress
had
said
they
should
have
--
has.
you're
familiar
with
that
longstanding
controversy
to
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
it
was.
that's
all
you
had.
then
what
we
have
here,
it
seems
to
me,
are
of
the
facts
that
perhaps
would
be
essential
in
some
way
in
the
court,
before
you
dispose
of
that
contention,
that
this
couldn't
be
moot.
because
it
was
a
part
of
a
continuing
practice
which
would
keep
on
something
wasn't
done
that
the
papers
up
to
that
time
should've
been
brought
into
the
court
so
that
it
could
determine
the
real
issue
which
they
were
raising
which
was,
that
you
had
a
practice
which
from
--
had
not
only
injured
them
in
the
past,
but
if
allowed
to
continue,
would
keep
on
doing
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
the
--
wasn't
that
the
issue
before
the
court
that
they
raised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
issue
they
raised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
tell
me
then
what
they
raised
in
that
connection,
forgetting
for
the
moment
if
you
can
that
there
was
a
permanent
order
that
one
issued,
and
that
you're
talking
about
a
permanent
order
because
all
they're
talking
about
is
a
temporary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
against
their
client?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
they
not
allege
that
it
was
against
the
water
carriers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
issue
they
raised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you
say
they
properly
rejected
with.
how
could
they
reject
it
without
seeing
the
papers,
to
see
what
had
been
done
and
to
have
something
--
some
knowledge
of
the
charges
they
made
that
this
was
part
of
the
continuing
practice?
how
could
they
do
it
without
looking
in
what
the
commission
had
before?
whether
the
railroad
raised
the
question
how
the
commission
acted,
how
soon
it
acted,
what
notice
it
gave,
who
it
talked
with
and
so
forth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
question
of
mootness,
then
that
gives
me
an
idea
i
hadn't
gathered
from
you
or
the
other
counsel
before.
your
question
of
mootness
suggests
to
me
that
you
are
not
relying
on
the
fairness
that
the
commission
has
made
it
moot
by
relieving
itself
of
these
14
months
of
order
but
that
--
they
didn't
have
a
right
to
litigate
this
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
we
take
judicial
knowledge
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
filed
to
take
judicial
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
each
charge
with
the
cases
of
--
where
water
carriers
were
involved,
actions
would
be
taken
which
denied
him
a
right
to
be
heard
at
all
when
the
(inaudible)
so-called
temporary
motion
pending
--
an
order
pending
14
months,
can
we
take
judicial
knowledge
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
same
thing
is
possible.
can
you
point
out
where
it
has
happened
where
railroads
protested
many
times?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
claiming
that
this
is
aimed
at
water
carriers
and
there
is
a
history
that
the
commission
has
done
some
things
which
the
court
found
could
not
be
done
with
reference
to
water
carriers,
is
there
not,
along
history?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
where
the
railroad
protested
that
it
was
being
disadvantageous
in
connection
with
the
temporary
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
action
was
taken
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
friedman,
i've
just
looked
at
the
dates,
what's
been
done
and
i
just
want
to
see
if
it's
correct.
the
complaint
was
filed
november
16,
1959?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
original
order
of
the
commission
that
the
railroad
asked
in
the
latter
part
of
1958
as
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
put
in
effect
the
certain
rates
which
these
carriers
--
the
water
carriers
claim
was
of
great
interest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
it
was
giving
them
an
advantage
and
depriving
him
of
that
natural
advantage.
the
commission
issued
an
order
refusing
to
suspend
those
rates
in
january
of
1959?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
suit
was
filed
november
16,
1959.
i
don't
know
what
went
on
in
between,
but
i'm
trying
to
get
at
this
situation.
then
the
case
was
answered,
was
about
to
go
to
trial
and
the
commission
on
march
28,
1960
notified
the
court
that
the
railroad
had
withdrawn
their
section
4
application.
and
that
therefore
it
was
no
longer
in
controversy.
at
that
time,
as
i
understand
it,
that's
put
in
effect
that
all
rates
which
are
--
were
in
effect
before
the
new
rate,
the
railroad
had
filed
to
which
it
--
the
water
carrier's
objective,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
grant
the
relief?
did
this
reinstatement
of
whatever,
or
decorations
of
a
new
rate,
whatever
it
was.
did
it
give
the
water
carrier
what
they
had
asked
in
their
protest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
now,
let
me
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
go
on
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
present
time
i'm
not
interested
to
know
why.
i'll
let
you
stay
just
a
moment.
then
the
plaintiffs
came
in
and
said
that
this
is
a
continuing
practice
of
the
commission,
and
we
want
you
not
only
--
we
want
you
first
to
enjoin
this
order
because
it
was
bad
itself.
and
secondly,
we
want
you
to
enjoin
the
practice
which
is
a
continuing
one
and
--
from
which
we
can
get
no
relief
except
by
an
order
to
the
commission
to
stop
doing
it.
and
the
court
pointed
out
on
page
64,
they
had
raised
these
two
questions
but
he
held
that
it
was
moot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
didn't
mean
to
stop
you
from
answering,
all
i
wanted
to
get
was
while
i
had
it
in
my
mind
those
dates.
now,
you
want
to
say
something
about
what
happened.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
be
very
much
interested
to
hear
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
against
that
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
the
water
carriers
practically
as
a
result
of
the
new
order?
i'm
not
--
just
forget
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
section
4
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
they,
from
withdrawing
the
old
order,
did
the
withdrawal
of
the
old
order
by
the
railroad
to
paraphrase
it,
did
that
in
and
--
if
that
had
been
in
and
of
itself,
all
it
was
done,
then
the
rates
would've
been
returned
to
the
original
level
before
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
mean
that
under
the
new
--
some
kind
of
a
new
order,
but
i'm
talking
about
--
suppose
you
just
--
they
just
withdrew
the
tariff
rate
to
which
the
objection
has
been
raised,
that's
all
that
happened
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
suppose
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
nothing
else
suggested.
the
commission
did
nothing
else.
what
would
then
have
been
the
status
to
the
railroad
rates,
over
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
they've
been
--
alright.
now,
did
they
on
this
order
which
has
been
held
moot,
have
they
been
restored
to
the
original
status?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
the
amount
that
they're
talking
about,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
involves
an
amount.
there's
an
amount
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
we
had
before,
and
the
amount
that's
in
here,
and
what
this
fight
is
over,
is
that
these
water
carriers
claimed
that
the
commission
has
been
--
as
i
understand
it,
systematically
by
various
devices
in
its
reading
in
reference
to
various
types
of
orders
has
been
systematically
discriminating
against
the
barge
line
rate
so
as
to
deprive
them
of
the
differential
level
to
which
congress
intended
them
to
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
then
you're
understanding
of
it
is,
mr.
hayes,
we
can
find
it
later,
your
understanding
of
it
--
and
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
find
out
in
that
connection,
is
that
while
there
was
one
level
of
a
high-rate
here
and
one
level
of
the
high-rate
here,
they
said
that
the
relationship
between
the
two
rates
was
