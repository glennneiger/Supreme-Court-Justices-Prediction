mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
take
one
moment,
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
am
the
co-counsel
with
mr.
johnson
in
number
14,
the
mercantile
bank
case
and
have
signed
the
briefs
in
that
case.
i
do
not
generally
represent
republic
national
bank
in
dallas
which
is
appellant
in
number
15.
mr.
neth
leachman
who
argued
number
15
before
your
honors
before
was
taken
seriously
ill
and
was
unable
to
come,
asked
me
on
monday
to
come
and
serve
for
him
and
i
am
doing
that.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
address
myself
to
the
question
which
was
under
discussion
when
counsel
sat
down
concerning
transferability.
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
texas,
the
subject
of
venue
is
taken
very
seriously.
there
is
a
statute,
revised
civil
statute
article
1995,
which
has
30
odd
subdivisions
of
exceptions
to
the
venue
right
to
be
sued
in
one's
home
county,
the
annotations
to
it
practically
filled
the
volume
that
is
the
venue
statute.
on
other
hand,
practice
on
a
plea
of
privilege
is
governed
by
the
texas
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
under
the
texas
rules
as
interpreted
by
our
texas
court,
there
is
full
provision.
and
in
this,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
counsel
for
transfer
of
actions
as
to
which
a
plea
of
privilege
is
sustained.
moreover,
under
article
1995,
there
is
an
exception
to
the
right
to
be
sued
in
one's
home
county,
which
says
that
where
there
are
codefendants,
they
may
be
sued
in
any
county
where
one
of
them
can
be
called.
and
under
that
provision,
coupled
with
the
transferability
provision,
my
understanding
of
texas
venue
laws
sir
is
that
this
whole
action
may
in
the
discretion
of
the
civil
district
court
in
travis
county
of
where
this
case
originated,
be
transferred
to
dallas.
in
any
event,
the
action
as
to
these
two
banks
may
be
transferred
and
maybe
tried
there.
that
may
present
some
difficulty.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
court's
discretion.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
it
has
--
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
my
understanding
is
it
could
sir,
the
texas
rules
of
civil
procedure
provided
for
it.
now,
if
the
--
if
--
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
about
transfer
--
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
no,
your
honor
because
the
trial
court
overruled
the
plea
of
privilege,
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
reversed
and
sustained
the
plea.
the
texas
supreme
court
in
turn
again
reversed
and
overruled
our
plea,
so
there's
never
been
any
consideration.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
that's
right.
well,
in
response
to
your
honors
question,
the
order
of
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals,
the
judgment
entered
upon
its
decision
at
record
350
provides
that
the
trial
court
was
instructed
to
render
judgment
sustaining
appellant's
plea
of
privilege
and
transfer
this
cause
as
to
appellants,
that
is
as
to
republic
and
mercantile
bank,
to
any
civil
district
court
of
dallas
county,
texas
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
rule
89,
texas
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
rule
incidentally
your
honor
is
printed
as
appendix
to
mercantile
bank's
opening
brief.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
maybe,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
i
apologize
sincerely
for
having
confused,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
the
texas
law
does
not
require
that
the
whole
action
--
perhaps
that's
the
point
of
confusion,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
texas
law
does
not
require
that
the
whole
action
be
transferred.
it
does
not
require
that
the
action
only
as
to
these
appellants
be
transferred.
it
permits
--
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
--
transfer
of
the
whole
action
as
i
understand
it.
and
--
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
have
two
--
two
replies
to
that.
one,
i
respectfully
believe
that
contention
is
incorrect.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
no
sir.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
i
believe
that
the
rule
is
not
--
that
governs
transfer
is
not
in
our
appendix
but
it's
in
the
texas
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
i'm
not
anticipating
this
question.
i
don't
have
the
name
--
the
number
of
the
rule
at
my
fingertips.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
we
would
greatly
prefer
to
do
so
and
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
secondly,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
reply
that
the
trial
of
these
banks
apart
from
the
other
defendants
is
a
hazard
and
not
an
insurmountable
one
of
litigation
which
would
be
encountered
anytime
that
the
federal
venue
statute
applicable
to
them
was
applied
and
the
balance
of
the
action
brought
in
travis
county,
texas.
turning
to
the
second
question
that
i
would
like
to
mention
in
reply
concerning
the
opinion
of
the
texas
supreme
court
in
the
langdeau
against
burke
investment
company
case,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
context
in
which
this
question
of
the
texas
supreme
court's
ruling
has
arisen
in
this
case,
is
a
contention
by
the
appellee
made
until
we
arrived
here
today,
that
article
21.28
of
the
texas
insurance
code,
subdivision
4
(f),
required
this
suit
to
be
brought
in
the
court
where
the
delinquency
proceedings
were
pending.
and
from
that
platform,
appellee
sprung
forward
to
the
contention
that
texas
law
had
localized
the
situs
of
an
action
by
a
receiver
as
though
it
were
not
a
plenary
suit
brought
with
the
separate
number
and
possibly
in
a
separate
court.
of
course,
we
pointed
out
that
such
a
contention
lived
down
an
avenue
which
would
prohibit
suits
by
the
receiver
in
any
federal
court.
a
suit
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
there
are
many
difficulties
rationally
with
that
contention
made
but
i
mentioned
it
only
in
order
that
the
court
may
appreciate
the
context
in
which
this
question
has
been
briefed
and
in
which
it
has
come
up.
now,
we
point
it
out
because
of
this
contention
in
the
reply
brief
on
the
merits
filed
by
mercantile
bank
in
number
14
which
was
then
number
90
last
term,
at
page
11
that
the
decision
of
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
in
holt
against
wheeler
in
which
the
texas
supreme
court
had
dismissed
a
writ
of
error
stated
section
4
(f)
is
remedial
or
procedural
because
it
deals
exclusively
with
the
venue.
it
is
not
a
statute
dealing
with
substantive
law.
now,
we
thought
that
decision
made
perfectly
clear
that
the
contention
of
appellee
that
this
action
had
been
“localized”
within
the
purview
of
casey
against
adams
was
untenable.
when
the
supreme
court
stated
in
langdeau
against
burke
that
the
statute
merely
signifies
an
intention
to
give
plaintiff
the
right
if
he
chooses
to
maintain
the
suit
there,
the
contention
disappears
all
together.
now,
lastly
in
response
to
this
question
of
local
actions,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
question
is
a
question
of
federal
and
not
of
state
law.
while
we
have
been
debating
here,
this
question
of
what
holt
against
wheeler
and
burke
against
langdeau
and
other
texas
decisions
hold,
in
our
view,
this
is
purely
a
question
of
federal
law
under
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
against
kepner
and
similar
decisions
holding
that
the
interpretation
of
a
federal
venue
right
is
purely
a
question
of
federal
law
for
this
court
to
determine
and
not
some
state
label.
under
federal
decisions
cited
in
our
brief,
in
the
reply
brief
of
mercantile
bank,
number
90,
last
term,
number
14
this
term,
those
cases
are
set
forth
and
clearly
show
that
this
is
purely
a
transitory
action
being
a
plenary
civil
action
for
money
damages
direct
offense
and
alleged
tort.
now,
i'd
like
to,
if
your
honors
please,
to
turn
briefly
to
this
contention
that
there
was
a
repeal
of
this
venue
statute
in
1882
by
the
congress.
as
a
preliminary,
i
would
like
to
say
that
between
1864
and
1875,
this
venue
statute
was
known
as
section
57
of
the
national
bank
act.
from
1875
on,
it's
been
known
as
section
5198
of
the
revised
statutes.
and
i
say
that
because
i'm
going
to
make
reference
to
some
cases
that
discussed
it
one
way
or
another.
in
1873,
the
congress
passed
an
amendment
to
section
57,
which
provided
that
there
should
be
no
attachment
in
a
state
court
against
a
national
bank.
that
aspect
of
section
57
passed
in
1873
has
no
application
here
except
that
it
casts
light
on
the
decision
of
a
later
case
in
this
court.
in
1882
because
of
the
1875
legislation
conferring
general
federal
question
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts
and
bringing
into
play
the
osborn
decision
for
national
banks
and
permitting
them
always
to
go
into
federal
courts.
congress
passed
this
legislation
saying
that
the
jurisdiction
of
suits
against
national
bank
--
by
and
against
national
banks
shall
be
none
other
than
banks
which
are
not
chartered
under
federal
law.
a
counsel
has
constructed
an
argument
based
on
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
say
federal
court
jurisdiction.
the
fact
is
that
this
court
has
passed
in
half
a
dozen
decisions
on
the
meaning
of
that
legislation.
the
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief,
petri
case
coming
down
finally
to
the
buford
case
in
1903.
and
in
the
buford
case
--
excuse
me
your
honor
--
this
court
said
that
that
1882
legislation
which
counsel
contends
repealed
the
state
court
venue
provisions.
the
necessary
effect
of
this
legislation
was
to
make
national
banks
for
purposes
of
suing
and
being
sued
in
the
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states,
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
they
are
respectively
located
and
to
withdraw
from
them
the
right
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states
simply
on
the
ground
that
they
were
created
by
and
exercised
their
powers
under
acts
of
congress.
no
other
purpose
can
be
imputed
to
congress
than
to
effect
that
result.
now,
with
all
of
the
possibly
appealing
arguments
made
by
counsel
for
the
treatment
of
a
bank,
one
bank
across
the
street
from
another
bank,
respectfully
your
honors,
should
be
addressed
to
the
legislature
and
not
to
this
court.
with
those
reasons
being
attributed
to
congress
by
appellee,
the
whole
argument
falls
when
this
court
says
to
the
--
flatly
to
the
contrary
that
no
purpose
such
as
counsel
is
suggesting
to
your
honors
can
be
attributed
to
the
congress
in
enacting
that
legislation.
now,
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
an
amendment
to
section
57
of
the
national
bank
act
prohibiting
attachment.
now
attachment
is
a
way
of
getting
personal
jurisdiction,
of
course.
and
in
the
van
reed
case
to
which
mr.
johnson
made
reference
and
which
is
cited
in
mercantile
bank's
opening
brief,
this
court
was
faced
with
a
contention
that
this
1882
legislation,
just
as
counsel
has
just
now
argued
to
you,
was
intended
to
put
all
banks
on
the
same
footing,
and
that
if
you
could
get
an
attachment
against
the
state
bank
than
this
1882
law
repealed
section
57
pro
tanto
to
put
on
them
on
an
equal
footing.
and
this
court
flatly
rejected
that
contention
and
(inaudible)
flatly
rejected
the
contention
made
by
counsel
today
that
this
act
relating
to
state
court
venue
was
somehow
repealed
by
1882
legislation
having
the
purpose
of
dealing
with
federal
court
jurisdiction.
thank
you,
your
honor.
