mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
--
and
if
it
please
the
court.
the
first
significant
and
most
important
result
of
construing
this
federal
statute
has
--
it's
urged
on
the
court
by
the
appellants,
is
that
you
are
going
to
create
a
substantial
area,
a
substantial
number
of
cases
where
neither
a
federal
court
nor
any
state
court
will
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
will
fall
up
for
this
reason.
national
banks
cannot
be
sued
or
sue
in
a
federal
court
at
this
time
in
most
instances
except
in
the
same
cases
in
which
a
local
state
bank
or
for
that
matter,
a
local
state
corp
--
corporation
can
sue
or
be
sued
in
a
federal
court.
there
are
certain
exceptions
when
there
are
suits
involving
a
co
--controller
but
that
--
that's
a
very
limited
area.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
the
force
of
it
is
that
a
national
bank
cannot
sue
in
a
federal
court
or
be
sued
in
a
federal
court
except
in
the
same
jurisdictional
circumstances
in
which
a
local
state
bank
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is
by
federal
statute.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
i
have,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that,
your
honor,
was
a
--
first
grew
out
of
a
statute
passed
on
july
the
12th,
1882.
it's
in
my
briefs.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
i'll
have
it
just
a
second.
page
27
of
the
brief.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
this
was
passed
on
july
the
12th,
1882.
and
it
grew
out
of
chief
justice
marshall's
decision
in
the
osborn
case
in
which
--
in
which
he
decided
because
a
national
bank
was
a
creature
of
congress
of
federal
statute
that
thereof
--
and
all
of
it's
rights,
powers
and
privileges
were
the
result
of
the
act
of
congress
therefore,
that
any
suit
that
was
instituted
by
or
against
the
bank
on
any
--
even
a
private
cause
of
action
necessarily
was
a
suit
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
therefore
it
was
removable.
the
railroad
cases
followed
that
same
reasoning
until
--
until
this
statute
and
then
a
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
now
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
yes.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
said
that
a
national
bank
can
only
institute
a
suit
in
a
federal
court
or
be
sued
in
a
federal
court
under
the
same
jurisdictional
circumstances
that
a
local
state
bank
with
--
with
a
limited
exception
set
out
by
the
statute
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
mr.
--
and
that
is
exactly
my
contention
in
--
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
and
i
--
what
i
am
trying
to
demonstrate
is
that
that
being
true,
and
since
our
state
venue
and
the
counties
in
which
suit
can
be
brought
in
the
states,
the
locality
of
actions
in
the
state
are
governed
by
state
law.
for
example,
a
suit
involving
title
to
the
land
like
in
the
casey
versus
adams
case.
we
can
only
bring
that
suit
in
our
statute
in
texas
like
most
statutes
and
this
has
common
law
history,
too,
says
that
it
must
be
brought
in
the
county
where
the
land
is
located.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
i'm
trying
to
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
--
that
we
--
that
there
--
if
you
follow
that
construction
of
the
statute
urged
by
the
appellant,
that
you
have
a
no
man's
land
area
in
which
you
have
numerous
cases
that
cannot
be
filed
either
in
the
federal
court
or
the
state
court
because
the
state
statute
controls
the
locality
of
actions
filed
in
the
state
court.
and
if
it's
a
suit
for
the
title
of
the
land,
it
must
be
brought
there
and
cannot
be
brought
elsewhere.
and
if
--
if
it
is
a
case
in
which
the
national
bank
cannot
file
in
a
federal
court
or
cannot
be
sued
in
the
federal
court
then
there
is
no
court
anywhere
in
the
land
where
that
particular
suit
can
be
filed.
and
that
was
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is
one
of
the
positions
that
we
are
--
have
taken
throughout
this
course
and
it's
in
our
brief.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is
correct,
sir.
because
--
i
say
that
because
this
statute
passed
in
1882
following
the
difficulties
that
grew
out
of
chief
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
the
osborn
case
in
which
they
were
removing
every
kind
of
case
possible
no
matter
what
the
amount
was
or
the
--
to
the
federal
courts
was
passed
in
which
it
says
provided
however,
that
jurisdiction
for
suits
hereafter
brought
by
or
against
any
association
established
under
any
law
providing
for
national
banking
associations
except
suits
between
them
and
certain
united
states
government
officials
and
the
government
shall
be
the
same
as
and
not
other
than
the
jurisdiction
for
a
suit
by
or
against
banks
not
organized
under
any
law
of
the
united
states
which
do
or
might
do
banking
business
whereas
such
national
banking
association
may
be
doing
business.
and
it
winds
up
and
says,
“and
all
laws
and
parts
of
laws
of
the
united
states
inconsistent
with
this
provision,
provides
all
be
and
the
same
are
hereby
repealed”.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is
not
in
the
code
now.
that
remained
in
the
code
of
the
united
states
from
july
the
12th,
1882
until
in
1948.
now,
this
is
a
part
of
the
banking
code.
in
july
--
in
1948,
when
the
judiciary
act
was
passed,
it
was
repealed
as
a
part
of
the
passing
of
the
judiciary
act
without
comment
although
most
statutes
that
were
repealed,
there
were
some
specific
reason
gave
--
given
for
that.
but
in
1948,
in
passing
title
28,
the
judiciary
code,
it
was
repealed
without
comment.
but
what
i'm
saying,
if
this
repealed
section
94
in
1882,
the
repealing
of
this
statute
in
1948
in
no
way
revise
or
reconstitute
section
94.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
no,
sir
it
did
not.
it's
still
a
part
of
the
banking
provision.
it
was
not.
and
the
1920
--
i'll
call
your
attention
further.
the
1926
recodification
did
not
repeal
the
prior
existing
laws
but
we
must
go
back
to
what
they
were
if
there's
any
question
about
it.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
in
the
morgan
case,
the
court
expressly
said,
“this
case
is
not
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
act
of
july
the
12th,
1882
because
it
was
passed
subject
--
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
this
suit
and
by
its
own
terms
has
no
application
to
it.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
and
if
it
had
no
application
to
that
case,
the
court
has
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
--
except
for
saying
that
the
court
had
no
reason
to
further
discuss
it.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
and
i
--
i
particularly
--
i
want
to
come
back
to
the
question
that
if
--
the
importance
of
our
position
because
you're
going
to
have
a
no
man's
land
area
in
casey
versus
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
well,
if
--
if
a
national
bank
can
always
sue
or
be
sued
in
a
federal
court,
then
i
am
wrong.
but
if
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
a
national
bank
except
in
certain
exceptional
instances
cannot
sue
or
be
sued
in
a
federal
court.
and
i
feel
personally
quite
sure
that
i
am
correct
in
that
except
under
the
same
jurisdictional
circumstances
that
a
local
national
bank
or
a
local
corporation,
then
you
have
a
land
title
suit
in
texas.
but
you
don't
have
a
diversity
of
parties.
you
don't
have
one
of
these
peculiar
or
one
of
those
federal
parties
in
there,
that
suit
cannot
be
filed
in
the
federal
courts.
it
cannot
be
tried
in
the
state
courts
in
dallas
county
in
this
instance.
it
must
be
tried
where
the
land
is
located.
therefore,
no
court
has
jurisdiction.
that's
the
significance
of
casey
versus
adams.
the
court
there
solved
this.
it
solved
that
in
suits
when
they're
talking
about
a
local
suit.
it
solve
that
under
state
practice,
that
suit
must
be
where
the
raise
was
in
that
instance.
and
that
if
they
should
give
94
the
full
literal
significance
that
is
urged
on
this
court,
that
there
would
be
no
court
that
had
jurisdiction.
and
therefore
they
said
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
the
suit
cannot
be
filed
in
a
federal
court
because
there's
no
diversity
of
parties
or
it
has
no
jurisdiction,
and
it
cannot
be
filed
in
the
county
in
the
state
court
where
the
banks
are
located
because
it's
a
land
suit
for
example,
there
is
no
court,
federal
or
state
that
has
jurisdiction
of
that
course
of
action.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
each
one
of
these
federal
statutes
have
recognized
that
the
congress
cannot
give
or
take
away
or
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
insofar
as
it's
--
the
causes
of
action
that
it
will
entertain.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
may,
if
i
--
if
i
may,
let
me
grasp
just
a
moment
on
that
question.
in
trying
to
--
to
establish
what
section
94
mean,
i've
gone
clear
back
to
the
creation
of
the
first
bank
of
the
united
states.
and
i
did
that
because
i
find
that
the
author
of
the
first
national
banking
act
of
1863,
apparently
from
reading
the
acts,
had
decided
on
the
previous
charters.
the
first
national
--
the
first
national
bank
was
created
in
18
--
1791
and
its
charter
provided
that
the
bank
was
empowered
to
sue
and
be
sued,
defend,
complain
and
answer
in
any
court
of
record
or
anywhere
else.
now,
the
first
case
that
came
up
under
that
act
was
the
deveaux
case,
which
was
simply
a
suit
for
conversion
by
some
georgia
citizens
against
a
branch
of
that
bank
situated
in
georgia,
there
was
not
a
diversity
of
citizenship
nor
was
there
any
other
jurisdictional
reason
why
it
could
be
filed
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
do
not
deny
that
in
the
least.
but
chief
justice
marshall
in
that
case
held
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
and
he
--
since
corporations
where
quite
new
in
the
united
states
that
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
alright.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
alright.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is
true
sir.
but
when
we
pass
on
--
when
that
charter
to
that
bank
expired
and
it
was
recreated
during
the
war
of
1812.
and
the
osborn
case
came
up
subsequently
in
the
early
1820's.
that
particular
provision
of
the
charter
had
been
modified
to
say
that
state
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
the
federal
circuit
courts
would
have
jurisdiction.
and
chief
justice
marshall
in
the
osborn
case
held
to
the
court
in
that
particular
instance
had
jurisdiction
and
quotes
the
new
language
in
the
second
national
bank
charter
and
sustained
it.
now,
that
charter
expired
during
the
jackson
administration
and
there
were
no
national
banks
until
the
national
banking
act
of
1863.
since
chief
justice
marshall,
we
might
not
then
viewing
it
from
this
1960
have
the
same
view
but
since
he
had
placed
significance
on
the
mentioning
of
the
federal
courts
by
name,
i
say
that
it
was
a
natural
thing
to
do
for
the
author
of
the
bill
in
1863
to
have
said
the
same
thing
in
which
in
1863,
they
did
with
no
mention
of
state
courts
at
that
time,
but
where
the
extra
language
for
the
first
time
may
be
sued
in
the
district
in
which
they
are
located.
in
1864,
that
whole
national
banking
act
was
repealed
and
a
new
one
passed
which
included
state
courts
and
had
the
reference
to
the
county
and
in
the
city
in
which
the
suits
were
filed,
which
i
say,
it
was
an
attempt
to
grant
affirmatively,
not
a
restriction
but
an
affirmative
grant
growing
out
of
the
history
in
the
deveaux
and
the
osborn
cases
and
not
an
attempt
to
restrict
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
chief
justice
marshall
himself
in
the
osborn's
case
has
this
to
say
about
the
deveaux
case,
whether
this
decision
be
right
or
wrong,
he
had
rejected
in
the
deveaux
case,
this
language
that
it
could
be
sue
or
be
sued
in
any
court
of
record,
whether
this
decision
be
right
or
wrong,
it
amounts
only
to
a
declaration
that
a
general
capacity
of
the
bank
to
sue
without
mentioning
the
courts
of
the
united
states
may
not
give
a
right
to
sue
in
those
courts.there
--
it
--
with
that
language,
there
is
no
--
there's
--
it
--
it
seems
to
me
to
follow
plainly
that
the
offer
of
the
banks
of
the
act
in
1863
and
1864,
thought
it
necessary
to
mention
the
courts
and
that
it
was
attempt
to
grant
jurisdiction
which
were
in
reality
this
other
language
was
amply
brought
to
have
permitted
such
suits.
and
if
i
may,
in
the
--
this
supreme
court
subsequently
speaking
through
mr.
justice
bradley
said
that
the
result
of
the
deveaux
case
was
to
leave
the
banks
open
to
be
sued
entirely
and
only
in
state
courts.
and
that
case
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
mr.
--
mr.
bradley's
language
is
quoted
there.
he
says
that
the
result
of
the
deveaux
case
was
not
to
leave
the
banks
where
they
couldn't
sue
or
be
sued
in
any
court.
but
it
left
them
solely
to
be
sued
and
sue
in
state
courts
because
the
language
of
the
act
of
congress
that
says
that
they
can
sue
and
be
sued
in
any
court
of
record
and
that
is
in
substance
still
a
part
of
the
national
banking
act
to
this
day
is
broad
enough.
and
there's
no
reason
on
earth
as
we
look
--
as
we
view
it
now
why
that
shouldn't
be
interpreted
to
give
them
broad
powers.
and
if
this
other
act
is
an
attempt
to
grant
affirmatively
power
and
not
a
restriction
where
you
have
another
part
of
the
statute
that
grants
broader
authority,
then
i
say
that
it's
not
controlled.
and
if
--
if
we
examine
the
terms
of
the
statute,
it
doesn't
say,
may
only
be
brought
in
the
county
where
--
where
the
bank
is
brought.
it
doesn't
say
shall
be
brought.
it
doesn't
say
must
be
brought.
it
says
maybe
brought,
which
would
indicate
that
the
author
means
that
he
thinks
he
is
granting
something
and
that
if
he
doesn't
grant
more,
there
is
no
more
wherein
in
fact
as
a
part
of
the
banking
--
banking
act
in
1863
and
to
the
present
day
is
this
provision
that
they
can
be
sued
in
any
court.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
i
do
not
think
at
this
time,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
--
serves
no
purpose.
but
it's
--
i
--
i
think
it
necessary
that
i
undertake
to
explain
the
existence
of
the
statute
and
why
it
exist.
and
i
believe
that
the
language
of
the
deveaux
case
and
the
osborn
case
in
the
history
of
suits
are
examined
carefully.
and
when
just
--
chief
justice
marshall
says
that
naming
the
federal
courts
was
important
and
necessary,
i
think
it
not
surprising
that
in
1863,
when
the
national
banking
act
was
passed,
that
they
again
named
the
federal
courts
at
that
time
the
district
courts
and
circuit
courts
and
territorial
courts.
and
again,
and
then
of
course
there
was
doubt
--
necessarily
doubt
with
reference
to
state
courts,
name
state
courts.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
there
is.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
believe
that
in
--
in
reading
the
deveaux
case
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
--
and
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
--
the
osborn
case
that
--
that
--
that
a
person
can
say
parti
--
not
--
of
course,
not
viewing
it
from
our
standpoint
at
this
time
but
at
that
time,
that
there
were
not
many
grave
doubts
because
the
--
just
--
chief
justice
marshall
for
example
says
that
a
corporation
couldn't
be
a
citizen
of
a
state.
and
therefore,
there
wouldn't
be
any
diversity
jurisdiction.
now,
well,
that's
changed
of
course.
there
are
many
doubts
that
are
cast
on
the
subject.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
he
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
--
if
they
talk,
he
discuss
this
whether
or
not
if
all
of
the
stockholders
lived
in
a
certain
county,
venue
or
state,
then
that
might
create
diversity
of
citizens.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
let
me
come
back
if
i
may
to
this
proposition.
i
have
searched
through
the
library
here
in
the
supreme
court
as
well
as
our
own
and
i
find
no
congressional
committee
reports
and
no
debates
on
the
intent
or
purpose
of
this
section.
i
think
in
the
morgan
case,
you
may
well
--
the
court
is
in
there
in
discussing
the
--
he
speculates
on
possible
purposes
that
it
might
have.
since
it
had
not
been
properly
raised
in
the
lower
case
and
the
morgan
case,
it
was
waived
and
the
court,
technically,
did
not
have
to
reach
the
question
and
did
--
it
didn't
cite
or
mention
casey
versus
adams
which
was
the
only
supreme
court
case
in
existence
that
time
which
had
held
local
actions
both
by
common
law
and
by
statute.
that's
the
language
of
casey
versus
adams.
local
actions
both
by
common
law
as
that
distinction
is
made
between
local
and
transitory
actions
and
by
statute.
and
the
court
was
saying
that
because
the
court
realize
what
my
first
premise
here,
that
the
locality
of
actions
in
state
courts
is
fixed
by
state
law,
either
common
law
or
statute
and
that
there's
a
broad
area
where
no
court
would
have
jurisdiction.
if
this
statute
has
given
an
absolute
literal,
unbendable
interpretation
and
that
if
you
file
a
suit
--
if
you
had
a
suit
involving
the
title
of
land,
i
use
that,
there
are
many
other
cases
in
some
county
where
the
bank
wasn't
located
and
the
federal
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
diversity
and
the
state
court
in
the
county
where
the
bank
was
located
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
its
own
local
laws
governing
the
locality
of
action.
no
court
has
jurisdictions.
no
court
has
jurisdiction
anywhere.
casey
versus
adams
is
founded
on
that
principle.
the
morgan
case
never
reached
it.
it
was
a
waiver
case.
the
bank
tried
its
case,
it
didn't
raise
the
question,
only
raised
it
on
appeal.
and
the
only
actual
decision
in
the
morgan
case
is
that
of
waiver.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
a
case
from
connecticut
and
another
case
which
specifically
and
expressly
say
that
when
a
statute
fixes
the
county
in
which
the
court
had
venue,
that
a
common
law
distinction
of
local
and
transitory
no
longer
upholds
and
that
it
is
a
local
action
by
state
statute.
we
do
have
a
texas
case
that
holds
that
--
our
venue
is
entirely
regulated
by
statute
that
the
common
law
distinction
between
transitory
and
local
action
no
longer
holds
and
that
they're
entirely
governed
by
statute.
and
in
the
court
in
casey
versus
adams
not
only
says
the
common
law
distinction
but
by
statute
recognizing
that
in
many
states
that
the
venue
is
controlled
or
the
locality
of
the
action
is
controlled
by
a
statute.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is,
they
decided
without
it.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
it
would
be,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
it
isn't
but
it
also
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
no,
but
it
is
a
peculiarly
local
actions
since
the
court
in
which
the
delinquency
proceedings
are
pending
has
custodia
legis
of
all
of
the
insolvent
insurance
company's
property.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
and
it
(voice
overlap)
it
is
a
district
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
travis
county,
texas.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
this
--
yes,
this
--
this
suit
if
independent
of
the
statute
and
going
back
to
the
common
law
of
distinction
between
transitory
and
--
and
local
action
would
be
transitory
and
it
is
--
it
is
a
sec
--
we
--
i
--
i
wouldn't
say
it's
entirely
tort
because
the
suit
against
the
banks
here
involves
not
only
a
charge
of
conspiracy
but
also
that
having
let
this
man
ben
jack
cage
borrowed
$920,000
on
december
the
31st
--
personally
on
his
personal
note,
the
vice
president
of
the
bank
taking
out
a
deposit
ticket
to
the
insurance
company
under
a
long
committees
agreement
that
the
money
won't
be
removed
and
it
will
be
paid
back
on
january
the
2nd.
and
then,
having
been
paid
back
the
banks
had
stopped
to
deny
that
those
are
not
the
funds
of
the
insurance
company.
so,
it's
not
entirely
tort.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
i
still
think
that's
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
e.
cureton
yes,
i
still
think
that's
a
transitory.
if
you
go
back
to
the
common
law
distinction
but
--
i'd
go
back
to
casey
versus
adams
which
not
only
says
local
action
has
a
common
law
of
history
but
as
made
so
by
a
statute.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
they
specifically
say
that
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
we
make
no
point
with
that.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
we
of
course,
were
trying
this
case
with
an
eye
on
being
here
today.
and
we're
--
and
we're
familiar
with
casey
versus
adams
and
--
and
wanted
them
to
decide
that
point.
but
they
actually
decided
it
on
a
different
basis.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
on
a
broader
basis
and
--
and
ignore
that
point
except
to
say
that
they
--
they
are
not
making
that
decision.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
there
--
if
i
may
say
this
much
further,
mr.
justice
stewart.
there
had
been
one
case
on
--
that
has
come
up
from
the
lower
courts
as
to
whether
this
particular
statute
was
mandatory
and
even
controlled
over
other
cases
where
they
were
--
had
been
mandatory
before.
it
went
to
intermediate
appellate
court,
the
supreme
court
of
texas
refused
a
writ
in
it.
there
has
recently
been
a
case
coming
up
from
another
intermediate
court
that
held
to
the
reverse.
the
supreme
court
in
--
of
texas
in
the
last
two
weeks
has
granted
a
writ
in
that
case.
in
the
first
case,
they
--
they
let
the
matter
stand
in
that
case
they
--
which
held
in
reverse,
they
have
granted
a
writ
so
we
have
--
of
course,
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
they
will
hold
that
this
statute
is
not
mandatory
in
controlling
over
other
mandatory
provisions
in
our
code.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
he
did
say
that
but
he
also
said,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
made
it
very
plain
that
he
referred
to
local
actions
both
at
common
law
and
local
actions
made
so
by
statute.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
all
candid,
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
language
of
course
in
94
that
specifically
for
the
course
in
casey
versus
adams
to
base
its
decision
on.
i
understand
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
--
we
understand
that.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
and
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
it
is
my
views
that
he
saw
clearly
at
that
point
that
there
was
an
area
where
no
court
would
have
jurisdiction
and
that
therefore,
some
distinction
had
to
be
made
between
a
situation
where
the
state
court
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction
in
the
county
where
the
bank
was
located
and
the
federal
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
of
the
case
here
because
there
was
no
--
either
by
subject
matter
or
no
diversity
upon
it.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
thank
you.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
of
course,
if
i
am
right
in
the
premise
that
that
act
is
repealed,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
oh
of
course,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
we
would
be
very
happy
in
this
litigation
to
have
it
decided
on
that
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
if
the
state
court
said
that
under
the
rule
of
casey
versus
--
versus
adams,
the
rule
wouldn't
apply.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
still
poses
a
serious
question
is
to
whether
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
if
they
say
that
that
is
not
a
local
action,
they
are
also
saying
at
the
same
time
that
that
suit
can
be
tried
in
dallas
county
under
texas
practice.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
under
texas
practice,
when
--
when
a
court
doesn't
have
venue,
the
suit
isn't
dismissed.
it
simply
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
--
transfers
the
case
--
the
papers
and
the
case
is
never
dismissed.
it
remains
on
file.
the
case
simply
would
be
sent
to
dallas
as
far
as
these
people
were
concerned.
but
we
--
the
promoters
of
this
corporation
and
the
directors
of
this
corporation,
who
were
parties
to
this
year-end
transaction,
could
be
down
in
austin
and
the
banks
would
be
in
dallas.
and
we've
been
in
pretty
bad
shape.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
we
would
have
to
transfer
as
to
the
banks
only.
we
couldn't
transfer
the
rest
of
it.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
so
we
would
have
the
banks
in
dallas
and
the
people
--
the
promoters
and
people
who
were
the
instigators
of
this
thing
would
be
in
another
court.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
sir?
mr.
william
e.
cureton
we
do
not
say,
mr.
justice,
that
this
stands
on
a
--
a
raise
or
the
common
law
distinction.
we
say
that
it
is
a
local
action
by
mandatory
state
venue
statute.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
makes
it
so.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
and
i
--
i
find
nothing
wrong
with
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
because
a
national
bank
in
reality
is
a
local
concern
doing
a
broad
local
business.
it
does
have
national
significance
and
in
the
beginning
had
in
even
much
broader
significance.
and
it
had
a
great
fight
at
one
time
between
the
state
banks
and
the
national
banks.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is
correct,
sir.
but
i
am
trying
to
create
an
environment
by
pointing
out
the
necessary
results
that
would
cause
this
court
to
want
to
find
that
my
interpretation
is
incorrect.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
with
reference
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
at
this
stage
of
this
proceeding,
from
a
very
practical
standpoint,
of
course
the
appellee
would
rather
--
and
prefers
to
have
this
matter
of
venue
if
that's
what
it
is
determined
at
this
stage
rather
than
to
try
the
entire
case
which
is
of
some
size,
and
then
have
it
reach
this
court
and
be
reversed
and
have
to
be
retried
again.
that
of
course
is
the
practical
basis
for
the
texas
statute
that
permits
a
direct
appeal
to
the
appellate
courts
in
texas
from
a
trial
court
decision
on
venue
so
that
that
question
maybe
finally
decided
and
it
was
finally
decided
in
this
case.
before,
you
try
the
case
on
the
merits
so
that
you
don't
try
the
case
and
then
have
to
come
back
and
retry
it
entirely.
based
on
the
--
that
doesn't
of
course
precluded
the
possibility
that
some
federal
question
could
arise
in
the
main
case
and
that
the
principal
case
could
be
back
here.
although,
reading
of
the
pleadings
would
not
indicate
that
a
federal
question
is
involved.i
do
not
intend
to
labor
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
we're
on
to
say
that
as
far
as
texas
is
concerned,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
on
this
venue
question
is
final.
there
has
been
no
trial
and
no
finality
to
the
trial
of
--
to
the
case
on
the
merits.
if
i
may
briefly
give
the
court
just
a
little
background
to
the
case,
this
suit
is
the
result
of
a
very
large
and
grand
promotion
of
an
insurance
company
known
as
the
ict,
insurance
company
of
texas
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
ben
jack
cage,
who
is
now
a
fugitive
from
justice
in
brazil.
the
liquidator
who
represents
the
creditors
of
that
company
and
the
stockholders
of
that
company
has
filed
a
suit
under
the
texas
practice.
texas
by
statute
has
created
a
state
board
of
insurance
commissions.
and
that
board
in
turn,
pursuant
to
statute,
has
designated
a
liquidator
for
insolvent
insurance
companies.
and
in
the
proceeding
in
the
state
--
in
the
county
of
the
state
capital
of
texas
pursuant
to
statute,
and
the
liquidator
has
been
designated
at
the
receiver
for
this
insurance
company.
now,
the
texas
statute,
as
a
part
of
our
insurance
code
says
that
proceeding
is
by
or
against
the
liquidator,
shall
be
brought
in
the
county
and
the
court
where
the
delinquency
proceedings
are
pending.
and
that
statute
controls
the
venue
and
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
unless
the
federal
statute
that
is
submitted
by
the
appellants
controls.
let
me
say
in
the
first
place
that
we
certainly
agree
that
in
the
supremacy
of
acts
of
congress
in
the
constitution,
we
do
not
contest
for
one
minute
that
proposition.
but
let
me
first
explain
to
the
court
the
choice
that
we
had
as
attorneys
for
the
liquidator
in
this
case.
the
allegations
are
that
the
two
dallas
banks
in
a
sequence
of
yearend
transactions
in
which
the
bank
was
represented
by
a
vice
president,
would
loan
this
man
cage,
large
sums
of
money
up
to
a
million
dollars
on
his
personal
note.
and
that
the
vice
president
of
the
bank
would
make
out
a
deposit
ticket
to
the
ict
insurance
company
for
that
sum
of
money
and
the
money
would
be
put
into
the
account
of
that
company.
there
would
be
a
loan
committee
memorandum
that
the
money
was
not
to
be
withdrawn
and
was
to
be
repaid
on
january
the
2nd,
three
days
later.
and
that
enabled
the
company
to
submit
to
the
board
of
insurance
commissioners
of
texas
a
yearend
statement
that
will
show
it
to
be
solvent
and
would
gain
it
a
license
to
do
business
for
the
succeeding
years.
the
promoter,
ben
jack
cage,
the
various
officers
of
the
corporation,
the
directors
of
the
corporation
and
various
other
people
connected
with
this
specific
transaction
to
confine
it
to
the
one
transaction,
are
people
that
we
want
and
feel
are
necessary
to
be
sued
in
a
single
lawsuit
involving
this
transaction.
so,
we
have
a
choice
now
applying
the
suit
in
dallas
where
the
two
banks
are
located
or
to
file
it
in
austin,
texas,
in
travis
county,
where
the
texas
statute
says
that
the
liquidator
may
institute
the
suit.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
the
statute
is
made,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
it
is
not
mandatory.
but
every
texas
--
may
i
say
this,
that
every
texas
case
except
this
recent
suit
involving
the
title
for
langdeau,
including
two
cases
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
texas
has
denied
a
writ,
has
held
that
the
texas
statute
contained
in
this
insurance
code
with
reference
to
venue
controls
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
this
very
case
held
that
control.
if
we
file
this
suit
in
dallas,
these
other
defendants
under
the
texas
practice
which
i
assume
must
be
the
practice
generally,
would
have
filed
pleas
of
privilege
to
be
sued
in
the
county
where
they
live
and
if
there
were
corporations
in
the
county
where
they're
doing
business.
and
since
we
didn't
file
it
in
travis
county
where
this
texas
statute
gives
these
jurisdictions,
they
would
have
had
an
absolute
right
to
have
move
their
part
of
the
case
to
the
county
where
they
live.
the
only
practical
opportunity
that
we
have
to
sue
all
of
these
people
that
are
important
and
necessary
to
this
proceeding
is
under
the
texas
insurance
code
which
says
that
we
have
the
right
to
sue.
the
liquidator
has
the
right
to
sue
in
the
county
where
the
delinquency
proceedings
are
pending
in
travis
county,
texas.
and
there,
we
can
sue
each
and
every
one
of
the
individuals
at
any
company,
any
private
corporation,
and
those
people
now
are
in
court
in
travis
county
and
can't
be
moved
to
dallas.
so
if
appellants
position
is
sustained,
the
suit
as
to
the
banks
alone
will
be
taken
out
and
move
to
dallas
whereas
the
other
principles
in
these
acts
are
left
in
travis
county.
let
me
go
now
to
the
statutes,
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
first.
the
first
case
that
arose
under
this
act
was
casey
versus
adams.
in
casey
versus
adams,
as
you'll
recall
involved
a
suit
for
foreclosure
of
a
mortgage
or
land
in
a
parish
in
louisiana.
a
bank
located
in
another
parish
was
made
a
party
defendant
and
the
bank
asserted
its
privilege
under
this
statute
to
be
sued
in
the
county
where
it
was
located.
and
this
court
in
casey
versus
adams
held
that
the
statute
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
a
local
action,
and
it
said
not
only
local
by
common
law
history
as
this
thing
we
contend
to
it,
but
local
by
statute.
and
we
have
cited
two
cases,
one
from
maine
and
one
from
vermont.
let's
say
that
when
a
state
statute
fix
this
venue,
that
cause
of
action
in
a
particular
case,
that
cause
of
action
in
that
case
is
a
--
constitutes
a
local
action.
in
this
case,
the
texas
statute
as
sustained
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
had
fixed
venues
in
travis
county
and
under
the
language
of
casey
versus
adams,
it
is
a
local
action.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
the
court
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
all
i
can
say
to
the
court,
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
respect
to
that
is
this,
that
there
had
been
five
or
six
cases
that
have
gone
up
under
this
texas
statute.
and
each
one
of
them
has
sustained
the
venue
in
the
county
where
the
delinquency
proceedings
are
pending.
this
suit
involving
the
title
of
land
came
up.
and
as
the
court
well
know,
a
land
has
always
occupied
a
unique
position
in
human
history
and
under
the
jurisprudence.
we
might
have
foreseen
i
suppose,
that
the
court
when
it
--
we
have
a
statute
that
says
that
a
suit
involving
the
title
of
land
must
be
brought
in
the
county
where
the
land
is
located.
then
we
have
this
statute
that
says
the
liquidator
can
file
a
suit
in
the
county
where
the
delinquency
proceedings
are
pending.
land
went
out
as
it
has
if
you
look
back
through
the
cited
cases
throughout
history
on
this
question,
land
always
went
out.
all
i
can
say
about
it
is
that
in
only
the
exception
of
land,
the
title
of
the
land,
as
it
been
--
as
the
statute
been
sustained
as
controlled.
in
this
very
case,
the
supreme
court
of
texas
held
this
statute
controlling
under
the
--
in
this
cause
of
action
and
in
this
case
and
in
every
other
case
that's
come
up
except
the
one
involving
the
title
of
the
land.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
i
do
not
say
that
the
court
says
--
may
have
stated
in
its
opinion
what
i
have
stated
but
ever
since
i've
been
out
in
law
school,
a
great
deal
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
courts
have
repeatedly
treated
land
and
particularly
with
reference
to
suits
involving
the
title
of
the
land
is
--
as
a
special
and
unique
situation.
i'm
presuming
as
a
matter
of
history
from
the
position
of
the
fact
that
land
was
the
only
source
of
wealth
for
great
many
centuries
and
had
a
special
relation
during
the
futile
days
perhaps.
and
you'll
find
that
throughout
the
decided
cases.
you
can't
get
a
--
but
you
can't
get
to
escape
the
fact
that
in
this
very
case,
the
same
court
held
this
statute
controlled
it,
and
that
there
are
five
or
six
other
cases,
all
of
the
other
cases
that
have
arisen
under
the
texas
statute
have
held
the
same
way.
that
court,
the
supreme
court
in
the
burke
case
is
not
reversing
the
position
of
those
cases
at
all.
none
of
those
cases
involved
the
title
of
land.
the
next
case
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
is
first
national
bank
versus
fellows
ex
rel
union
trust
company
which
reached
this
court
from
wisconsin
in
which
a
proceeding
there
had
been
instituted
at
the
state
capital.
and
the
bank
was
a
party
and
was
located
in
another
county
and
raised
this
very
question.
and
the
court
decided
that
the
venue
and
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
this
county
of
the
state
capital,
controlled.
justice
van
devanter
and
it's
to
show
that
if
the
matter
was
before
the
court,
justice
van
devanter
in
his
dissent
takes
the
position
that
this
federal
statute
should
have
controlled
it
but
it
did
not
control
it,
and
the
decision
of
that
--
of
the
court
at
that
time
was
just
as
in
casey
versus
adams,
it
sustained
the
venue
in
a
different
county.
the
morgan
case
cited
by
appellants
was
a
case
in
which
the
court
held,
and
let
me,
in
all
frankness
say,
that
the
opinion
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
federal
statute
is
controlling.
i
don't
deny
that
at
all.
but
the
decision
is
that
the
privilege
that
the
bank
has,
and
i
would
say
if
it
had
one,
was
waived
when
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
lower
court,
it
wasn't
raised
until
it
was
on
appeal.
now,
i'd
like
to
further
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
that
opinion,
the
court
expressly
states
that
this
proviso
to
the
act
of
july
the
12th,
1892
which
we
rely
as
repealing
this
statute,
the
court
expressly
stated
that
that
suit
had
been
filed
before
that
act
was
passed
and
that
that
act
was
not
considered
in
reaching
the
decision.
now,
except
by
reference
in
two
other
cases,
which
didn't
involve
the
point
at
all,
there
are
no
other
decisions
by
this
court
on
the
point.
of
course,
there
are
great
many
state
court
decisions
as
counsel
for
appellant
has
said.
and
for
one
reason
or
another,
they
have
generally
and
nearly
unanimously
found
that
this
statute
does
not
apply.
now,
i
would
like
for
a
minute
to
trace
the
history
of
the
statute
as
i
understand
it.
the
first
national
bank,
bank
of
the
united
states,
was
created
by
act
of
congress,
granted
a
charter
by
act
of
congress,
it
was
no
banking
act,
in
1791
and
existed
for
20
years.
and
it
had
a
provision
in
this
charter
granted
by
congress
that
said
that
the
bank
could
sue
or
be
sued
in
any
court
of
record
or
anywhere
else.
following
the
--
the
granting
of
charter
and
some
years
later
while
the
bank
was
still
in
existence,
the
supreme
court
in
the
deveaux
case
held
that
that
did
not
confer
--
that
language
did
not
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
circuit
court
which
at
that
time
was
the
trial
court
of
the
federal
system.
that
the
federal
courts
had
only
expressed
jurisdiction
and
that
this
language
would
not
confer
jurisdiction,
although
it
would
give
authority
for
the
corporation
to
be
sued
when
the
court
did
have
jurisdiction.
that
--
the
charter
of
the
first
--
of
the
bank
of
united
states,
the
first
one,
expired
after
20
years
in
following
the
financial
problems
of
the
war
of
1812
was
rechartered
as
the
second
national
bank
of
the
united
states
in
1860.
and
the
charter
of
the
second
national
bank
in
addition
to
the
language
that
i've
quoted
that
it
could
sue
and
be
sued,
complain
and
defend
in
any
court
record,
also,
specifically
said
that
the
circuit
court
of
the
united
states
has
jurisdiction.
and
it
is
my
view
that
that
was
the
outgrowth
of
the
deveaux
case.
and
an
effort
to
give
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
court
in
the
famous
osborn
case
the
supreme
court
subsequently
held
that
the
bank
having
been
chartered
by
act
of
congress,
any
suit
that
it
was
involved
then
was
a
suit
under
the
law
of
the
united
states.
and
according
to
the
language,
stated
that
the
federal
courts
had
jurisdiction.
after
that
charter
had
expired
as
a
result
of
--
during
henry
jackson's
administration,
there
were
no
national
banks
at
all
from
1836
to
1863,
the
present
national
banking
act
which
has
come
down
to
us
with
amendment
before
us
was
passed.
and
the
first
--
and
if
that
national
banking
act
is
read
side
by
side
with
these
older
charters,
you
will
see
that
the
author
of
that
act,
wrote
the
banking
act
with
his
eye
on
many
other
provisions
contained
in
those
original
charters
including
specific
authority
for
the
national
bank
to
be
sued
in
the
federal
circuit
and
territorial
courts.
a
year
later,
the
state
courts
were
expressly
included.
and
the
language
of
that
act
though,
instead
of
saying
generally,
said
in
the
county
and
city
or
territory
in
which
they
are
located.
now,
it's
my
position
that
that
language
grew
out
of
the
old
deveaux
case
which
had
held
that
the
federal
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
until
finally
the
second
charter
had
been
granted
in
which
they
were
given
expressed
jurisdiction.
and
that
it
was
thought
necessary
both
to
mention
both
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts.
and
that,
that
that
is
not
a
restriction
but
an
affirmative
grant
and
the
language
of
that
statute
says
‘may'.
it
doesn't
say
‘may
only
be
brought'
or
‘must
be
brought',
it
says
‘may'.
and
that
historically
as
an
affirmative
grant
and
not
a
restriction,
there
was
still
a
broader
language
which
is
still
contained
in
the
national
banking
act
that
national
banks
can
sue
and
be
sued,
defend
and
complain
in
both
--
in
any
court
of
record
and
in
subject
to
that
language
has
come
down
to
us
to
this
day
and
it's
much
broader
than
that.
but
if
i
am
wrong
about
that
and
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
i
am,
and
that
this
language
was
a
restriction
and
incidentally,
although
--
and
united
states
code
annotated,
it
says,
venue
statute,
it
says
venue
as
a
heading
for
this
section
of
the
statute.
neither
the
original
act
nor
any
other
official
publications
of
the
acts
of
congress
had
used
or
ever
used
the
word
‘venue'.
and
i
think
it
means
jurisdiction.
but
let's
assume
that
it
is
a
restriction.
by
1882,
the
national
banks
were
going
--
were
removing
all
cases
to
the
federal
courts.
i
will
agree
with
counsel
and
that
a
number
of
decisions
have
arisen.
there
were
filing
suits
in
the
federal
courts
and
they
were
removing
cases
to
the
federal
courts.
and
congress
had
an
intent
and
a
purpose
to
put
national
banks
for
the
purpose
of
lawsuits
on
the
same
footing
as
state
banks
located
in
the
same
counties
and
territories
where
the
national
banks
were
located.
and
as
far
of
renewing
the
charter,
understanding
the
charters
of
the
existing
banks
and
also
applicable
to
all
future
banks,
it
passed
this
act
of
july
the
12th,
1882,
in
which
it
said,
the
jurisdiction
for
suits
hereafter
brought
by
or
against
any
association
under
any
law
providing
for
national
banking
associations,
and
then
it
accept
suits
between
them
and
the
united
states
or
its
officers
and
agents,
shall
be
the
same
as
and
not
other
than
the
jurisdiction
for
suits
by
or
against
banks
not
organized
under
any
law
of
the
united
states
which
do
or
might
do
banking
business
whereas
such
national
banking
associations
maybe
doing
business
when
such
suits
maybe
forgotten.
and
then
it
says,
“all
laws
and
parts
of
laws
of
the
united
states
inconsistent
with
this
proviso
be
in
the
same
or
hereby
repealed”.
now,
that's
not
limited
to
suits.
it
says
nothing
about
suits
in
federal
courts.
it
says
suits.
and
counsel,
of
course,
following
that,
the
leather
--
this
leather
manufacturers'
national
bank
versus
cooper
and
several
other
cases
arose
in
which
involved
an
attempt
to
remove
cases
to
federal
courts.
and
i
do
not
deny
that
the
language
of
this
statute
would
apply
in
a
removal
case.
i
simply
say
that
congress
was
trying
to
put
national
banks
on
the
same
footing
as
state
banks,
not
only
in
removal
cases
but
in
all
suits,
it
says
suits.
and
i
might
say
for
that
i
have
traced
every
recodification
of
the
federal
statutes
down
to
the
present
for
fear
that
this
present
act
that
is
being
urged
by
the
appellants,
might
have
been
repassed.
and
except
for
the
recodification
in
1874
which
was
before
this,
all
of
the
others
have
expressly
said
that
they
are
not
original
enactments
and
they're
not
--
that
they
do
not
pass
the
language
as
contained
therein
as
a
new
law.
and
if
there's
any
dispute
as
in
1926,
if
there's
any
dispute
as
what
the
statute
means,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
original
enactment.
i
might
say
in
closing
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
there
is
none,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
had
been
finally
settled.
they
are
now
in
travis
county.
had
we
brought
the
suit
initially
against
all
of
them
in
dallas,
they
would
have
filed
a
plea
of
privilege
setting
up
where
they
live.
and
under
texas
law,
they
will
--
texas
put
to
that
no
alternative
where
to
move
that
the
case
is
condemned
to
that
county.
that
is
the
very
purpose
of
this
insurant
provision
because
after
all,
we're
dealing
with
the
business
which
is
a
business
affected
by
public
interest,
as
the
court
knows,
in
which
there
is
a
special
provision
for
an
insurance
commission
to
regulate
those
issues.
there
is
a
special
provision
for
a
state
liquidator
to
handle
insolvent
insurance
companies
or
insurance
companies
in
distress.
and
so
that
it
can
be
held
in
an
orderly
fashion
that
all
suits,
all
parties
can
be
brought
into
the
single
court.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
texas
statute
and
that's
the
reason
it's
been
held
controlling
in
every
cases
after
this
land
title
suits.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
it
was
and
it
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
this
particular
case
--
this
particular
case
was
decided
before.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
yes,
sir.
the
langdeau
case
--
the
merchant
v.
--
both
the
langdeau
because
langdeau
is
the
liquidator
in
all
of
the
suits.
the
burke
investment
company
case,
the
recent
case
does
not
overrule
any
of
the
prior
decisions
with
reference
to
the
controlling
effect
of
this
statute
except
as
to
section
14
of
our
statute
relating
to
land
titles
and
when
that
--
the
fact
that
that
case
was
pending,
was
mentioned
here
by
counsel
before
--
in
the
previous
argument,
i
knew
very
well
and
i
felt
uneasy
to
tell
that
and
i
didn't
tell
this
court
that
that
case
would
--
that
this
case
--
this
particular
case
had
any
connection
with
that
one
because
realizing
that
rarely
is
it
held
that
you
can
sue
for
title
of
land
anywhere
where
the
land
is
located.
and
that's
just
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
things
that's
engrained
in
our
human
system,
our
common
law
system,
and
our
system
of
jurisprudence.
nonetheless
in
this
case
it's
settled
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
there
are
many
problems
that
would
--
could
be
inherent
in
this
situation
and
i
don't
think
texas
is
different
from
other
states.
if
you
sue
the
administrator
of
a
state,
you
got
to
sue
him
where
the
administration
is
pending.
if
you
want
to
file
a
mandamus
proceeding
against
the
state
official,
you
got
to
file
it
usually
at
the
county
where
the
state
capital
is
located.
a
bank
that
is
just
as
well
involved
the
decision
in
the
burke
case
is
a
good
illustration.
suppose
the
bank
claim
to
be
the
owner
of
an
interest
in
a
track
of
land
in
texas,
and
it
was
located
in
another
county.
and
the
national
bank
or
the
texas
bank
then
can't
remove
the
case
to
a
federal
court
and
the
suit
can't
be
filed
on
the
federal
court.
in
texas,
that
suit
must
be
filed
where
the
land
is
located.
now
this
court
holds
that
it
must
be
filed
where
the
bank
is
located
and
there
are
other
parties
to
the
suit,
how
can
the
texas
court
proceed?
since
it's
governed
by
the
state
law
as
far
as
the
locality
of
action
is
concerned,
it
must
--
it
must
say
that
the
suit
has
to
be
where
the
land
is
located.
the
supreme
court
has
said
it
in
this
case.
mr.
william
e.
cureton
it
isn't
a
land
case.
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
i'm
simply
saying
that
to
illustrate
--
mr.
william
e.
cureton
that
is
right.
i'm
simply
giving
that
as
an
illustration
of
the
practical
difficulties
and
i
say
that
--
i'd
say
that
a
no
man's
land
area
is
going
to
be
created
where
if
the
case
can't
be
filed
in
the
federal
court
and
can't
be
removed
to
a
federal
court,
then
under
the
texas
statute,
it
must
be
in
the
county
where
the
land
is
located.
for
example,
no
court
will
have
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
