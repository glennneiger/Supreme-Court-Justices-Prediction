justice
charles
e.
whittaker
let
me
see
if
i
understand
that.
after
a
challenge
of
the
venue
has
been
overruled,
there
is
no
way
under
your
law
to
preserve
the
point,
were
you
--
did
you
come
in,
except
by
appeal,
if
you
come
in
and
defend
even
though
over
protest
you
still
have
waived
venue?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
the
case
you
mention,
that
would
be
a
sort
of
a
dual
appeal
and
both
are
within
the
prescribed
time.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
was
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
now,
is
it
true
that
the
statute
which
gives
the
right
to
sue
and
be
used
has
anything
to
do
with
the
place
where
isn't
that
left
to
the
other
statute
namely
94
or
am
i
not
wrong?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
