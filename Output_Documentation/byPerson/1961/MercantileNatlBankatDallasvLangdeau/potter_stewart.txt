justice
potter
stewart
on
this
case,
the
texas
court
explicitly
refrained
from
deciding
whether
or
not
this
was
a
local
action,
am
i
right?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
if
--
if
you're
right
as
to
the
casey
case
that
carved
out
of
its
--
at
least
carved
out
on
the
exception
that
94
would
respect
the
local
actions
and
if
this
court
should
decide
that
that's
all
it
did,
then
would
it
be
your
view
that
it
would
be
our
duty
to
remand
it
to
the
texas
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
was
a
local
action
under
local
law?
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
for
us
to
determine
that
it
was
a
local
action.
this
certainly
isn't
the
kind
of
traditional
interim
action
about
the
--
about
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
a
suit
to
acquire
title
or
anything
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
a
tort
action?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
--
what
--
what
was
that
slander
theory
be?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
that's
just
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
where
is
--
can
you
tell
us
any
opinion,
any
record,
which
i
guess
begins
on
page
365,
where
it
is
that
the
texas
court
says
that
they
are
refraining
from
deciding
whether
or
not
there's
a
local
action.
i
can't
find
it
but
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
they
had.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
they
had.
justice
potter
stewart
on
a
broader
basis.
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
my
question
to
you
and
i
guess
perhaps
you've
answered
it
is
whether
you
think
it's
up
to
us
to
decide
whether
this
was
a
local
action
or
whether
if
we
decide
that
casey
exception
should
prevail
that
we
should
remand
it
to
the
texas
court
to
decide
or
whether
under
local
laws
or
local
action.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it'd
be
at
your
first
argument
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
your
bank
is
located
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
dallas.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
lawsuit
was
brought
in
austin?
justice
potter
stewart
we
--
some
of
these
cases
like
colorado
river
case
we
have
a
map
in
front
of
us
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
have
the
map
(voice
overlap)
it's
about
200
miles?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
is
the
other
bank
located?
justice
potter
stewart
also
in
dallas.
justice
potter
stewart
lawyers
are
not
arguing
against
that
principle.
