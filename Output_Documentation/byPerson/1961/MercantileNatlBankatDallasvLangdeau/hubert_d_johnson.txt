mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
two
cases
appeals
by
the
two
banks
have
been
consolidated
same
issues
involved.
i
will,
as
the
attorney
for
appellant
in
number
90,
held
the
opening
--
opening
fully
rebuttal
period
used
by
mr.
leachman
representing
the
appellants
in
number
91.
this
case
--
or
these
cases
present
an
issue
that
does
not
seem
to
have
been
before
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
in
recent
years.
a
suit
was
brought
in
a
state
court
in
travis
county,
texas
by
the
receiver
of
ict
insurance
company.
many
defendants
of
144
the
pleading
indicates,
two
of
them
or
two
national
banks
with
offices
established
in
dallas,
texas,
dallas
county,
texas
approximately
200
miles
away
from
travis
county,
which
travis
county
is
a
state
capital.
the
two
banks
thought
that
they
had
a
right
to
have
venue
of
actions
against
them
in
the
state
court
in
their
home
county
where
they
were
established.
they
each
filed
the
type
of
pleading
that
the
state
practice
calls
for
setting
up
this
claim
of
right
of
venue.
in
texas,
we
call
it
a
plea
of
privilege
so
designated.
it's
been
called
a
privilege
by
--
towards
allover
the
country
and
other
town.
we
actually
have
a
name
for
it
that
we
call
it
a
plea
of
privilege.
it
asserts
a
right
of
venues.
the
receiver
of
the
insurance
company
controverted
said
“no,
we
have
a
right
to
maintain
venue
in
the
court
here
in
austin,
in
the
state
court
here
in
austin
because
there
is
a
state
statute
that
gives
venue
of
actions
by
or
against
a
receiver
of
an
insolvent
insurance
company
in
the
state
court
in
austin,
in
the
state
court”.
there's
no
question
of
jurisdiction
of
a
state
court.
there's
no
argument
in
this
case
that
it
ought
to
be
in
a
federal
court.
the
argument
pertains
to
where
the
venue
should
be
and
whether
or
not
the
venue
right
that
was
contained
in
the
original
national
bank
act
of
1864
and
was
apparently
inadvertently
omitted
in
1873
revised
statute
and
then
reinstated
in
the
1875
act
to
correct
errors
and
omissions
confers
that
right
on
these
two
national
banks.
and
on
the
opposite
side
of
that,
the
receiver
mr.
langdeau
says
that
this
state
statute
is
controlling
overrides,
takes
away
the
right
or
that
the
right
doesn't
exist
which
is
another
way
of
saying
the
same
thing.
now,
the
court's
notation
in
this
case,
noted
it
was
postponing
jurisdiction
to
consideration
for
the
day
along
with
the
merits
and
that
outset.
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
jury
--
about
the
jurisdiction
phrase.
the
venue
hearings
under
our
state
practice,
and
i
don't
think
its
uncommon
practice,
or
the
issue
as
to
ju
--
venue
here
are
joined
by
the
filing
of
a
plea
of
privilege
and
by
the
filing
of
a
controverting
affidavit
and
then
an
issue
is
drawn
and
the
court
hears
that
and
here
its
first.
it's
a
separate
venue
trial.
there
were
two.
in
this
instance,
they
were
heard
consolidately
because
they
were
the
same
basic
issue.
both
banks,
admittedly
national
banks,
both
banks
owned
the
offices
in
dallas
direct
clash
between
the
state
statute
and
the
federal
statute.
that
was
the
issue
that
was
before
the
travis
county
district
court
when
it
was
appealed
from
that
court
to
the
austin
court
of
civil
appeals,
the
intermediate
court
of
civil
appeals.
there
was
a
stipulation
filed
in
the
record
showing
that
that
had
been
the
only
issue.
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts.
it
was
a
dispute
as
to
the
clash
between
the
two
laws.
the
austin
court
of
civil
appeals
said
that
they
thought
that
the
federal
statute
was
clear
and
controlling
and
said
that
the
venue
should
be
transferred
to
district
courts
in
dallas
county
texas.
state
district
courts
in
texas,
by
the
way
by
texas
constitution
have
jurisdiction
of
all
damage
suits
seeking
damages
in
excess
of
$
1000.
so
this
was
a
$15,000,000
tort
damage
suit
as
the
very
lengthy
pleading
shows.
and
so
that
was
the
order
judgment,
judgments
entered
by
the
austin
court
of
civil
appeals,
a
single
opinion
written
in
the
two
cases
because
they
presented
the
same
issue.
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
took
the
case,
the
cases
is
up,
heard
them
again
consolidatedly
handed
down
judgments
said
that
the
state
statute
was
controlling.
we
say
that
it
leaves
the
federal
statute
as
meaningless
and
having
no
meaning
with
reference
to
any
proceeding
of
the
state
court
and
that
was
all
court
they
were
then
passing
on
although
it
has
two
pieces,
both
relating
to
venue
one
and
venue
or
proceedings
in
federal
courts,
one
venue
in
state
courts.
now,
the
only
jurisdictional
objection
or
issue
that's
been
drawn
in
issue
is
this
to
whether
or
not
the
judgments
are
final
within
the
framework
of
the
introductory
phrases
to
section
1257
dealing
with
appeals
from
final
judgments
of
the
state
court
of
last
resort.
and
we've
called
the
state
court
of
last
resort,
i
think,
the
record
clearly
shows.
we've
had
our
motion
of
rehearing
overruled
withdraw
in
the
state
court
on
this
venue
issue.
we
--
in
our
brief
looked
at
this,
we
feel
act
carefully
and
they
looked
clear
all
due
regard
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
on
the
interpretation
of
final,
both
in
section
1257
and
in
section
1291.
and
we've
gone
back
and
check
as
best
we
can.
and
they
seem
to
mean
the
same
thing
and
the
same
policy
standards
of
their
print.
the
case,
it
seems
to
us
to
be
most
clearly
in
point
was
the
case
of
--
in
the
cohen
versus
mutual
benefit
that
came
up
under
section
1291.
it
was
subsequently
followed
in
swift
and
company
versus
compania
columbiana
whatever.
i
can't
pronounce
it.
i'm
not
very
good
in
spanish.
but
it
was
followed
in
that.
it's
a
rather
narrow
--
narrow
aperture.
it's
not
open
just
every
time
you
have
a
temporary
provisional
tentative
phase
of
a
case.
but
there's
nothing
temporary
or
provisional
about
this
under
the
state
court
practice,
which
is
where
we
were
in
the
commissions
that
we
have
to
deal
with.
the
venue
trial
was
a
separate
trial.
there
had
to
be
an
appeal
from
it
within
20
days
from
the
order
or
else
it
was
final.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
holds
that
it
is
not
appeal
from,
it's
waived.
the
determination
is
res
judicata
as
to
venue.
it's
no
longer
within
the
control
of
the
trial
court.
they
have
even
po
--
held
that
at
the
end
of
the
term
and
we
just
have
two-month
terms
to
this
courts
that
the
court
can't
even
on
its
own
motion
make
the
change.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
that's
the
thrust
of
these
holdings
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
it
was
an
exception
in
the
early
days
that
it
commented
on.
and
i
would
not
be
--
i'd
be
less
than
frank
but
it
mentioned
it
where
you
had
a
case
that
proceed
immediately
to
trial
on
the
merits
disposed
them
for
the
same
term,
you
can
bring
them
up
together
but
that
was
a
situation
in
which
you
could
perfect
your
appeal
from
the
total
within
the
20
days.
it's
a
very
narrow,
not
available
in
144
defendant
case,
not
available
in
hardly
any
case.
but
conceivably,
during
might
be
convene
to
pass
on
the
venue
issue,
the
court
might
overruled
it,
go
right
ahead
to
try
two
or
three-daytime
could
be
brought
up.
that's
the
only
condition
under
which
you
would
be
safe
in
bringing
the
whole
case
up
together
in
texas.
otherwise,
the
courts
hold
that
you
have
a
right
of
appeal.
you
must
appeal
if
you
want
to
continue
to
complain.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
both
within
the
prescribed
time.
you
would
have
to
beat
it
to
the
gate.
you'd
have
--
you'd
have
to
stay
within
the
time
limits
because
it's
sort
of
--
of
an
exception
to
the
statutory.
it
was
now
expressed
in
court
rules
but
it
--
it
was
one
time
expressed
in
statute.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
that's
correct.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
and
that's
the
reason
that
we
have
gone
to
careful
consideration.
we
think
careful
consideration
of
the
radio
station
wow
versus
johnson.
the
cases
that
get
into
this
area
of
certain
segregated
or
partial
issues
unrelated
to
other
issues
such
as
the
cohen
case
and
the
swift
and
company
case,
cases
that
went
the
other
ways
such
as
republic
natural
gas
company
versus
oklahoma.
but
it
seems
to
me
in
fairness
to
say
that
--
that
court
recog
--
the
court
recognized
that
this
was
not
some
sort
of
an
arbitrary
of
technical
matter
and
that
you
did
have
to
make
a
choice
between
certain
realities.
the
cases
that
i
find
it
--
have
emphasized
the
fact
that
it's
a
federal
court
application
intended
to
be
cases
that
where
the
state
court
was
trying
to
claim
some
degree
of
lack
of
finality
in
the
appellate
process
such
as
the
richfield
oil
company
case.
and
i
believe
one
of
the
others
arnold
--
no,
not
arnold
case
the
marquestry
railroad
case
where
there
was
a
power
of
review
to
me
that
came
up
in
california.
and
there
was
a
continued
power
of
review
and
the
question
was
“is
this
really
final
now
or
do
we
have
to
wait
until
that
last
power
of
review
is
--
is
exhausted?”
but
i
--
i
think
that
we
--
we
realize
and
we
say
in
our
brief
and
we
recognized
that
all
this
texas
practice
is
not
controlling
on
its
court
but
it
goes
to
consideration
of
the
finality
in
fact
and
the
fact
that
you
have
complete
finality
as
a
completely
practical
matter
and
that
there
is
no
other
way
to
find
out
if
you
can
be
tried
in
dallas
county
under
--
under
texas
practice
except
just
to
go
head
on
in
--
in
travis
county.
and
you
probably
would
not
have
any
right
of
complaint
at
all
in
texas.
i
know
you
would,
whether
you
adhere
confront
the
argument
that
where
you
had
a
final
judgment
and
you
didn't
appeal
timely
that
worried
in
some,
too.
and
you
--
you
have
to
be
right
on
--
on
the
timely
right.
the
--
we
made
a
--
a
very
lengthy
and
critical
comparison
of
it
with
the
standards
that
were
describe
in
the
cohen
case.
the
formality,
the
being
a
formal
judgment,
being
conclusive
of
the
issue,
the
being
separable
from
and
collateral
to
and
we're
not
merged
into
the
judgment
distinguishing
from
the
montgomery
trades
council
case
involving
a
temporary
injunction
where
the
issue
is
still
before
the
court
on
final
injunction
hearing
as
the
same
set
of
facts
still
subject
to
the
provisional
review
and
control
of
the
court.
and
frankly,
on
the
basis
of
what
we
consider
a
fairly
careful
analysis
of
this
matter,
we
believe
this
court
that
this
is
--
these
are
final
judgments
that
the
necessary
element
of
finality
is
present.
and
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction.
now,
we
approach
the
question
discussing
many
of
these
landmark
cases
with
some
fair
accreditation
because
they're
the
court's
own
cases.
and
they
interpret
them
in
a
way
but
we
tried
to
put
things
out
and
put
together
we
think
the
cases
in
our
brief
that
are
pertinent
to
the
issue.
we
believe
that
they
established
the
finality
that's
required.
turning
briefly
to
the
interpretation
of
a
statute,
the
question
of
whether
we
have
the
right,
the
statute
which
we
quote
in
our
brief
was
section
57
of
the
national
bank
act
1864.
and
it
deals
with
actions
and
proceedings
against
national
banks
in
specified
federal
courts
and
in
specified
state
courts.
the
1863
act,
which
just
had
a
tenure
of
a
little
bit
more
than
a
year
which
authorized
the
formation
of
national
banking
associations
took
a
completely
different
approach
to
it
and
referred
to
a
proceedings
by
or
against
national
banking
associations
in
specified
federal
courts.
you'll
find
a
complete
divergence
of
change
in
approach
in
the
1864
act.
the
1873
revision,
for
some
reasons
that
is
not
apparent,
did
not
include
this
particular
section
57
of
the
national
bank
or
anything
--
bank
act
or
anything
like
it
but
there
were
a
number
things
that
were
left
out
in
the
1873
revision.
and
couple
years
later,
in
1875,
they
were
--
an
act
was
passed
to
correct
errors
and
omissions.
and
this
was
put
back
some
potentially
the
same
language
that
it
had
before.
it's
probably
not
necessary
to
say
whether
or
not
it
was
ever
dropped
out
the
law
or
not,
it's
been
referred
to
frankly
as
having
been
a
part
of
the
law
since
1864
without
--
without
interruption.
the
first
case
that
came
along
to
construe
this
was
a
state
court
case.
a
case
up
in
new
york
court,
cook
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
about
1867
and
it
said,
well
this
is
just
permissive.
you
can
sue
anywhere
in
the
state
notwithstanding
what
it
said
on
the
statute.
couple
of
years
later,
the
massachusetts
court,
they
wrote
a
case
called
crocker
versus
marine
national
bank.
in
the
crocker
case,
arrived
to
just
the
exact
opposite
result
of
the
new
york
court
said
that
this
had
to
mean
must
under
this
context
and
otherwise
it
did
not
mean
anything.
so,
purpose
meaningless
if
you
put
in
the
period
of
permissive
form.
and
about
1871,
there
was
a
case
that
called
bank
of
bethel
versus
pahquioque
bank
which
was
a
suit
in
a
state
court
in
connecticut
that
went
on
up
and
came
to
this
united
states
supreme
court.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
adverted
to
the
statute
said
that
the
suit
had
been
brought
in
a
proper
state
court,
state
court
had
jurisdiction.
it
would
mention
that
is
was
a
court
that
was
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
simply
apply
the
statute
verbatim.
in
1880,
this
came
before
this
court
again
in
casey
versus
adams,
which
was
a
case
that
came
up
to
the
state
courts
in
louisiana.
it
came
and
arose
under
the
louisiana
form
of
statute
that
dealt
with
determining
priorities
or
classifying
rates
--
ranks
of
privileges
the
way
they
use
it
in
the
civil
code
statute
where
a
mortgage
foreclosure
had
occurred.
the
money
was
in
the
court.
who
was
to
get
the
money?
the
state
statute
there
said
that
it
--
this
court
was
the
only
one
that
had
the
power
or
jursisdiction
to
make
this
determination
and
only
on
this
national
bank
said
that
the
new
orleans
court
was
the
only
one
with
jurisdiction.
it
came
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
united
states
supreme
court
in
casey
versus
adams
apparently
look
at
the
statute,
gave
it
a
construction
said
that
this
was
a
typical
interim
proceeding,
an
action
which
was
classified
as
a
local
action
which
was
old
as
action
themselves.
and
that,
it
was
their
opinion
that
this
statute
was
not
designed
to
apply
to
such
typically
local
actions
as
this.
in
the
next
case
that
came
before
this
court
and
the
key
case
as
we
see
it
is
first
national
bank
of
charlotte,
north
carolina
versus
morgan.
opinion
was
written
in
1889
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
first
mr.
justice
harlan.
it's
a
very
interesting
opinion.
the
--
a
bank,
national
bank
in
north
carolina
was
sued
in
a
state
court
in
north
carolina
which
was
not
in
the
county
in
which
the
court
maintains
this
business.
they
were
sued
and
for
them
to
recover
this
double
penalty
for
exacting
your
jury's
interest.
the
bank
defendant
lost
his
lawsuit
on
--
in
the
--
on
the
appeal
in
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
for
the
first
time,
it
said
wait.
they
couldn't
say
it
sue
us
there
anyway
jurisdiction.
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
void
judgment.
the
--
or
one
of
their
contentions
they
are
making
was
that
only
a
federal
court
would
have
jurisdiction.
they
were
basing
it
on
exclusive
jurisdiction
section
of
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
dealing
with
suits
to
recover
penalties
under
federal
laws.
first
they
said
that's
wrong
because
the
subsequent
statute
dealing
with
national
banks
was
a
later
statute
and
modified
that
feature
of
it.
then
they
said
this
state
court
was
not
the
right
state
court.
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
had
to
decide
what
was
the
nature
of
this
right.
they
cited
the
crocker
case,
the
early
massachusetts
case.
they
cited
the
bethel
case.
they
said
that
it
was
a
personal
privilege.
it
was
written
years
before
the
(inaudible)
case,
but
it
sounded
a
great
deal
of
lacking.
they
say
it
was
a
waivable
personal
privilege.
if
it
had
been
claimed
it
must
have
been
granted
by
the
court
--
the
state
court
in
which
it
had
been
brought.
now,
that
case
continues
to
be
and
is
the
key
case.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
first
national
bank
versus
morgan.
we
refer
to
it
all
the
way
through
as
the
morgan
case.
they
used
afraid
that
if
there
was
an
exception
that
statute
was
an
exception
that
it
was
an
immunity.
pretty
strong
language
has
said
no
use
speculating
as
to
why
congress
granted
it
so
far
as
that
it
did
grant
it.
the
austin
court
of
civil
appeals
felt
that
that
case
was
fully
controlling
on
this
federal
statute.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
said
we
are
not
going
to
follow
it.
we
consider
that
dictum.
we
don't
think
it
was
dictum.
we
think
that
it
was
right
straight
to
answering
the
issue.
the
issue
was
what
sort
of
a
right
does
this
statute
grant?
and
the
answer
would
agree,
not
jurisdiction,
venue,
a
waivable
right
but
if
asserted
it
must
be
granted,
must
be
recognized.
and
thus,
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
key
case
that
we
feel
has
been
disregarded
by
the
texas
court.
it's
been
disregarded
in
a
number
of
other
states,
a
lot
of
collection
of
state
court
cases
in
the
briefs.
we
didn't
do
anything
set
put
and
in
the
appendix
because
we
felt
that
only
served
to
illustrate
was
the
confusion
among
the
various
states
and
the
almost
extremes
to
which
they
have
gone
to
try
to
make
a
clear
statute
into
something
that
they
could
not
apply
and
that's
about
all
that
they
--
they
seem
to
me
to
show.
there's
a
california
case,
the
monarch
wine
company
case
that
we
make
particular
reference
to
because
it
has
such
a
thorough
review
of
both
state
and
federal
court
cases.
the
cases
that
have
construed
and
applied
this
statute
as
to
venue
in
the
federal
courts,
which
as
i
say
is
the
first
part
of
it
have
without
exemptions
said
that
it's
--
unless
there's
a
waiver
or
consent
to
be
sued
elsewhere
the
venue
right
in
the
federal
court
says
is
provided
for
since
against
the
national
banks
has
provided
for
right
here
in
this
section
and
those
cases
come
right
on
down
to
very
recently.
the
argument
is
--
has
been
made
just
briefly
the
subsequent
after
1889.
there
was
a
case
in
1917
it
--
before
this
court.
first
national
bank
versus
fellows
ex
rel.
union
trust
company,
a
quo
warranto
proceeding
brought
on
relation
in
the
state
capital
in
michigan
against
the
bank
--
national
bank
having
trust
powers
under
section
11
(k)
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
and
that
--
in
that
case
the
banks
actual
office,
the
place
of
business
was
not
in
the
state
capital.
in
the
state
courts,
there
were
no
argument,
no
--
no
point
made
of
that.
it
was
not
urged.
it
was
not
even
urged
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
although
a
dissenting
opinion
went
back
and
say
we
can
consider
a
jurisdiction
when
it
could
--
should
have
been
in
--
in
this
particular
situation
would.
most
the
argument
there
was
about
whether
not
a
colorado
type
of
proceeding
--
was
a
type
of
proceeding
that
ought
to
be
brought
in
the
state
court
and
whether
it
ought
to
be
brought
against
the
national
bank
or
whether
it
ought
to
be
brought
exclusively
in
a
federal
court.
in
1923
in
bank
of
whitney
versus
bank
in
america
case,
a
national
bank
with
offices
in
new
orleans
was
sued
in
a
federal
court
in
the
state
of
new
york.
they
attacked
jurisdiction
that
they
weren't
there
and
weren't
doing
business
there
and
couldn't
be
sued
there.
it
did
not
raise
this
venue
right
provide
for
under
r.s.
5198
or
section
57
or
is
codified
as
12
u.s.c.
94.
it
didn't
raise
that.
and
so,
in
the
united
states
supreme
court,
i
think
its
mr.
justice
brandeis
wrote
the
opinion
as
i
recall.
are
those
--
excuse
me,
he
concluded
saying
that
we
do
not
have
to
reach
this
question.
it's
not
before
this
court.
the
jurisdiction
point
was
there
from
the
beginning
was
raised
there
such
the
absence
of
it's
being
present
in
the
federal
district
court
in
new
york,
footnote
to
the
opinion
sites
the
statute
r.s.
5198
cites
first
national
bank
v.
morgan.
but
it
seems
to
me
rather
than
declining
to
discuss
it,
he
simply
says
there's
another
ground
here
that
we
do
not
have
to
go
into.
that's
the
only
--
that's
the
only
thing
as
so
i
read
the
case
to
me.
as
far
as
i
can
tell
and
i
think
we
made
a
careful
search
other
than
one
or
two
cases
where
there's
been
advertence
to
the
section
in
federal
court
cases
cope
versus
anderson
as
i
recall
made
advertence
to
the
12
u.s.c.
94.
but
that's
the
--
that's
the
case
law
on
it.
the
--
in
1875,
the
united
states
--
the
congress
made
a
very
material
amendment
to
the
judiciary
act
conferring
jurisdiction
on
federal
courts
in
the
area
of
so-called
federal
question.
apparently,
prior
to
them
and
i
was
not
aware
that
until
i
begin
studying
this.
diversity
had
been
the
basis
of
it
and
sole
basis
of
it
except
where
there
had
been
special
statutes.
that
also
put
provision
and
therefore
removal
on
federal
question
--
basis.
and
of
course,
in
the
light
of
some
cases
as
had
drawn
the
great
deal
of
support
from
osborn
versus
second
bank
of
united
states,
you
run
in
the
situations
where
by
virtue
of
federal
origin,
there
was
a
basis
for
saying
that
any
case
involving
brought
by
or
against
the
national
bank
was
one
that
the
bank
could
bring
in
the
federal
court
if
it
wanted
to
and
if
it
was
sued
as
a
defendant,
it
could
be
remove
the
federal
court.
well,
that
lead
to
some
mandatory
legislation.
in
1882
act
first
which
was
a
kind
of
garble
and
then
in
1887
and
1888
act
to
clarify
what
they
meant
as
four
or
five
cases
and
if
going
down
the
line
on
that
and
made
very
clear
and
that,
that
was
all
addressed
to
the
matter
of
jurisdiction
not
venue
all
addressed
to
the
manner
of
clarifying
the
lack
of
availability
of
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
because
of
federal
origin.
the
cases
discussed
the
famous
pacific
railroad
removal
cases
which
seem
to
point
up
the
pandora's
box
which
had
been
opened
by
the
1875
act
at
least
sets
away
the
--
you
got
a
situation
in
which
yes,
you
have
state
court
jurisdiction
but
it
could
be
ousted
by
removal
by
many
of
these
railroad
companies
and
all
of
the
national
banks
and
that
have
to
be
clarified
in
petri
versus
continental
bank
and
the
whitmore
versus
amoskeag
bank
and
the
con
--
commercial
national
bank
versus
--
continental
national
bank
versus
buford.
we
cite
a
couple
of
those
cases
and
they're
all
cited
in
the
petri
case
and
in
the
buford
case,
too,
as
i
recall.
make
it
put
it
clear
as
to
what
that
amendatory
legislation
was
driving
at.
it
has
never
been
construed
to
have
any
other
effect
in
the
1948
rewriting
of
the
judicial
code.
the
statute
contained
a
lot
of
--
of
things
that
were
expressly
repealed.
and
it
stated
among
those
expressly
reapeal
was
this
1882,
1887,
1888
legislation
that
dealt
with
the
same
subject.
it's
now
in
28
u.s.c.
1348
as
i
recall.
and
that
is
not
to
me
indicative
of
any
change
in
the
clearer
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
local
action
thing,
i'll
revert
to
that
a
little
bit
more.
this
action
here
then
exert
contain
in
the
pleading
that
takes
up
the
first
321
pages
of
this
record
for
which
i
would
like
to
apologize
in
making
the
record
so
lengthy
but
i
couldn't
figure
out
how
to
present
a
case
without
pleading
and
i
couldn't
also
figure
out
how
to
condense
it
because
it
was
so
difficult
to
--
to
do
that
sort
of
thing.
but
if
you
turn
to
the
prayer
portion
of
it,
you'll
see
that
it
is
a
tort
action
based
on
a
claim
grand
conspiracy,
fraudulent
conspiracy
extending
over
from
1950
to
1957.
144
parties
and
some
of
them
apparently
coming
in
and
off
the
scene
at
one
time
and
another
seeking
joint
and
several
liability
a
claim
for
some
$15
million,
some
special
claims
on
special
acts
against
the
different
defendants
which
are
covered
in
the
part
b
of
the
prayer.
there's
certainly
nothing
about
it
that
suggests
that
it's
anything
other
than
the
normal
tort
action,
transitory
in
nature,
be
brought
wherever
you
--
wherever
you
want
to,
nothing
local
in
that
nature.
the
statute
that
they
refer
to
here
that
the
state
supreme
court
of
texas
seem
to
rely
so
heavily
on
was
this
1955
statute.
there's
nothing
but
a
venue
statute.
it
refers
to
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction.
it
was
not
planned
to
give
any
new
jurisdiction.
our
jurisdiction
is
given
by
constitutional
provision
in
texas,
district
courts,
all
land
suits,
all
damage
suits
over
a
thousand
dollars,
the
courts
under
$500,
between
$200
and
$500
they
had
to
be
our
county
court
wasn't
changing
any
of
that.
there's
been
a
state
court
case
in
texas
holding.
and
it
was
purely
a
venue
statute
that
it
even
applied
to
existing
facts
and
that
it
did
not
violate
the
provisional
ex
post
facto
theory
because
it
was
a
procedural
venue
statute.
and
it
just
took
right
over
and
applied
a
lawsuit.
it
was
brought
after
even
those
based
on
facts
that
are
ruled
before.
the
--
there's
nothing
that
i
can't
see
in
the
statute
that
purports
to
create
any
kind
of
an
action
or
to
make
it
local.
if
you
have
an
action
against
the
receiver
on
a
rejected
claim,
there
is
a
section
of
the
statute,
section
3
(h)
of
article
21.28
that
like
so
many
instances
and
receivership
statute
says
that
you
present
your
claim,
one
is
denied
then
you
sue
in
the
receivership
court
but
this
is
not
that
kind
of
an
action.
it
is
just
exactly
the
opposite.
the
receiver
who
is
suing
the
banks
and
many
others
for
things
that
happened
to
the
insurance
company
from
1950
to
1957
long
prior
to
the
receivership
suing
28
or
30
parties
that
by
the
pleadings,
allegations
live
outside
the
state
are
foreign
corporations
has
not
doing
business
in
the
state
to
get
in
personam
jurisdiction
is
not
going
to
be
impossible
in
all
probability
to
do
it
in
the
state
district
court
there
in
austin.
i
don't
think
that
the
local
action
claim
stands
on
the
basis
of
any
common
law.
the
definition
of
local
is
transitory
by
its
very
nature
by
the
definitions
of
this
court
in
some
cases
that
we've
cited
by
the
definitions
of
the
texas
courts
in
cases
that
we've
cited
there
and
by
all
the
literature
that
you
could
see
on
it.
the
statute,
this
insurance
code
does
not
purport
to
create
any
locality
of
action.
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
say
we
don't
pass
on
whether
this
is
a
local
or
transitory
action.
no
indication
that
they
were
much
impressed
with
that.
if
i
could
just
use
a
minute
or
two
to
summarize
the
opening,
it
is
the
position
of
the
appellants
in
these
cases
which
are
here
consolidated
that
the
right
given
to
them
by
the
federal
statute
has
been
finally
determined
against
them
that
the
validity
of
the
state
statute
is
contracting
with
the
applicability
of
the
federal
statute
has
been
appealed,
that
it
comes
clearly
within
section
1257
if
it's
final
then
it's
final.
it's
final
under
all
practical
tests.
it's
comes
clearly
within
the
test
outlined
in
the
cohen
case.
and
it's,
therefore,
we
feel
that
this
is
a
case
where
jurisdiction
of
this
court
can
attach,
should
attach
the
--
there's
no
other
place,
no
other
way
that
this
determination
whether
this
right
exist
can
be
made.
it's
been
--
we've
gone
the
gamut
in
texas
and
we've
haven't
been
able
to
make
it
get
into
recognition.
as
to
the
merits
phrase
of
it,
we
have
a
very
clear
statute.
it's
a
venue
statute.
it's
a
valuable
venue
right.
it's
been
denied.
and
we
feel
that
there
isn't
really
a
great
deal
of
doubt
about
the
fact
that
in
first
national
bank
versus
morgan,
the
court
correctly
construed
the
statute
and
that
the
texas
supreme
court
was
completely
erroneous
in
saying
that
this
was
a
matter
that
was
--
i
think
the
use
of
phrase
insulated
from
federal
judicial
review.
well,
when
the
interpretation
of
a
federal
statute
and
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
that
right
is
available
to
us
is
not
a
matter
that
can
be
brought
for
federal
judicial
review
then
we
have
completely
repealed
section
1257,
i
think.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
no

mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
no,
sir.
i
did
not

mr.
hubert

yes,
sir,
i
--
i
have.
i
have
not
put

in
my

now.
i
did
that
although
the
state
courts
but
i
--
i
do
and
i
have
a
complete
disagreement
with
them.
i
cited
them
in
the
--
in
the
appendix
there
but
i
don't
agree
with
the
lineup
of
them
at
all.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
the
appendix
to
the
brief
in

brief
appellant

90
has
a
list
of
them
over

53
--
i'll
put
my
glasses
on.
i
can't
see
the
numbers
--
page
53,
appendix
c.
i
believe
that
that's
an
exhausted
list
of
the
state
court
decision
and
53,
54,
55
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
that's
right.
there
may
be
one
or
two.
they're
not
in
that
list
but
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
we
made
a
pretty
exhausting
search
of
them
and
we
don't
agree
with
them
at
all.
many
other
cases
were

like
in
the
morgan
case,
it
was
waived
not
presented.
others
are
cases
of
strictly
local
action.

have

the
only
reference
that
i
can

is
in
the

in
the

which
said
we
don't
have
to
reach
this
question.
mr.

i
didn't
interpret

way.
i
didn't

elusion
to
it.

mr.

that's
the
one
it
was
in
a
federal
court
in
new
york
on
a
bank
that
did
its
business
in
new
orleans
and
went
up
on
the
jurisdictional
point
for
no
--
nothing
was
made
of
the
other
point.
it
seems
to
me
all
the
court
was
saying
that
there's
another
thing
that
this
thing
could've
going
up
and
we
don't
have
to
write
about
it
because
it
wasn't
brought
before
the
court.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
where
number
14
and
number
15
were
consolidated
in
this
court's
original
october
1961
order,
were
argued
in
february
28
and
29,
consolidated
and
--
or
here
again
today
in
that
shape.
the
cases
come
from
judgment
of
the
texas
supreme
court
hereby
appeal
through
the
root
provided,
we
believe,
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1257
(2).
the
cases
in
each
case,
national
banks
located
in
dallas
where
their
sole
offices
in
dallas
had
been
sued
in
--
as
one
of
two
of
144
defendants
according
to
the
pleading,
in
a
state
court,
state
district
court
in
travis
county,
austin,
texas.
for
information
of
non-texan
that's
approximately
200
miles
from
dallas
and
that
austin
is
right
on
the
very
center
of
the
state,
dallas
is
a
little
bit
north
there.
the
--
most
of
this
record
is
comprised
of
the
rather
lengthy
pleading
which
was
the
suit
itself
or
the
allegations
are
made
by
the
plaintiff.
the
plaintiff
was
the
receiver
appointed
by
the
court
of
an
insolvent
insurance
company.
he
also
is
a
--
an
official
as
provided
for
by
state
law
and
only
as
the
statutory
liquidator.
and
by
the
state
law
he
becomes
the
receiver
by
appointment
of
the
court.
each
of
the
banks
promptly
filed
what
we
call
a
plea
of
privilege
under
texas
practice
which
is
the
method
of
setting
up
the
assertion
of
the
venue
right.
each
set
up
by
--
for
itself
as
it
had
to
under
texas
practice
its
right
to
have
the
cause
transferred
as
to
it
--
to
its
home
county
there
in
dallas
county.
the
only
place
where
it's
established
and
the
only
place
that
it
does
have
a
place
of
business.
we
don't
have
a
branch
office
problem
here.
texas
is
--
did
not
have
branch
banking
and
that's
there
--
was
their
only
office.
the
venue
issue
is
set
for
separate
trial
as
is
provided
for
under
state
practice.
we've
attached
to
our
briefs
the
--
two
practice
rules
that
govern
it.
each
of
the
venue
claims
or
pleas
of
privilege
were
controverted
by
the
receiver
and
a
hearing
was
held,
actually
hearings,
although
when
it
developed
that
there
are
really
no
fact
issues
that
it
was
basically
a
stipulated
matter
in
the
law
issue,
they
were
held
consolidatedly.
orders
entered
in
each
case
denying
the
pleas
of
privilege.
then
each
of
the
defendants
took
its
appeal
to
the
austin
court
of
civil
appeals.
each
had
to
decide
then
under
state
court
practice
whether
it
would
appeal
or
not
appeal
because
if
it
did
not
do
so,
the
matter
was
closed
under
state
practice.
the
austin
court
of
civil
appeals
had
before
it
the
case,
both
the
cases,
a
stipulation
that
the
only
issue
involved
was
this
legal
issue
of
whether
the
provision
of
the
national
bank
act
of
1864
origination
gave
the
national
banks
this
venue
right
notwithstanding
a
venue
right
that
the
receiver,
plaintiff
had
conferred
on
him
by
1955
texas
statutes.
the
austin
court
of
civil
appeals
said
that
the
trial
court
had
erred
in
these
cases
and
then
ordered
the
cases
transferred
and
the
appeal
then
went
to
the
texas
supreme
court
and
it
said,
“no,
the
austin
court
of
civil
appeals
had
not
erred.
the
time
for
motion
of
rehearing
filed
overruled,
were
through
in
texas”.
this
court
in
its
october
order
noted
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction
was
carried
forward
to
consideration
along
with
the
merits.
the
casebooks
tell
me
that
that's
a
warning
to
me,
that
i
better
come
prepared
to
talk
about
jurisdiction.
i
talk
some
about
it
before
and
i
want
to
talk
some
more
about
it
now.
if
i
can't
get
in
here
what
the
rest
of
the
questions
involved,
that
would
make
much
difference.
i
have
before
in
the
period
of
time
when
we
are
preparing
our
notice
of
appeal,
we
made
a
--
what
we
think
is
a
very
careful
study.
we
have
followed
it
up
thereafter
and
we
have
devoted
the
substantial
part
of
our
brief.
better
than
half
of
it,
as
i
recall,
to
this
jurisdiction
question,
a
jurisdiction
question.
first
has
in
it
the
aspect
of
finality
of
the
matter
as
far
as
the
state
court
is
concerned,
the
state
practice.
we
have
cited
case
in
here,
the
supreme
court
of
texas
case
that
i
think
is
contained
at
page
16
of
our
brief
is
which
it
all
falls
in
sr
company
v.
mcdonald
which
announces
a
number
of
rules
that
might
not
be
the
practice
everywhere
on
a
venue
right
but
they
are
the
practice
in
the
law
in
texas
and
they
make
it
beyond
--
clear
beyond
peradventure
that
we
had
to
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
unless
we
wanted
to
acquiescent
that
we
could
not
sit
back
and
bring
the
matter
up
again.
in
that
wichita
falls
railroad
case,
in
fact,
that's
just
exactly
what
have
happened.
in
july,
one
term
of
the
court,
the
trial
court
had
overruled
a
plea
of
privilege.
later
in
november
at
another
term
of
the
court,
the
defendant
who
had
asserted
the
plea
of
privilege
had
the
temerity
to
say,
let's
reconsider
this.
and
he
had
--
he
is
more
persuasive
the
second
time.
the
trial
court
then
said,
“alright,
we'll
transfer
it.
we'd
already
transferred
it.
i
grant
you
plea
of
privilege”.
the
appellate
courts
pointed
out
to
him
that
he
could
not
do
that,
that
this
was
a
separate
trial
that
it
granted
that
it
had
certain
interlocutory
phases,
he
would
not
lack
a
ruling
on
appeal.
there
is
not
enough
lack
of
ruling
that
could
be
carried
forward
if
this
had
--
the
time
to
appeal
was
now,
that
it
not
haven't
been
appealed
from,
and
that
the
order
attempting
to
make
the
transfer
was
void.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
appellee
disagrees
with
me
in
the
slightest
as
to
what
wichita
falls
railroad
company
versus
mcdonald
said.
now,
i'm
aware
of
the
fact
that
that's
what
the
texas
court
has
said
as
to
the
finality
of
this
phase
of
the
case,
this
res
judicata
plea
which
is
a
basic
element
of
finality
is
fully
recognized
in
texas
and
we've
--
this
case
was
not
the
first
case
it
so
held
is,
it
was
the
most
recent
one
in
texas
and
it
is
more
or
less
the
keystone
case
that
we
all
cite.
in
gospel
army
versus
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
yes,
that's
true.
i
quite
agree
and
i
realize
i
have
not
--
that's
only
the
one
aspect
of
it
and
certainly
apart
from
saying
that
that
is
conclusive
of
it.
yes,
sir.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
that's
the
way
--
yes,
sir.
that's
what
we're
saying.
the
--
the
trial
on
the
merits
is
not,
it
all
concern
with
whether
dallas
national
bank
in
dallas
or
a
national
bank,
it
would
be
the
same
thing
if
we
were
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
--
individuals.
involved
questions
--
it
would
appear
both
state
law
and
common
law
principles
as
to
the
pleading
as
a
typical
transitory
tort
action
for
a
lot
of
money,
the
$15
million
bond
which
even
in
their
own
ways
is
a
lot
of
money.
the
--
so
we
began
to
look
at
these
cases
in
this
court
that
have
gone
--
that
have
interpreted
this
meaning
of
final
judgment
as
in
1257
(2),
also
as
in
1391
which
relates
to
the
final
decisions
of
district
courts.
in
our
federal
district
courts,
they
do
have
an
area
there
for
appeals
from
certain
types
of
specified
interlocutory
orders
but
if
you
don't
come
within
one
of
those
then
you
have
to
get
in
this
final
category.
that
led
us
to
the
decision
of
this
case,
this
court
in
the
cohen
versus
beneficial
industrial
corporation
in,
i
believe,
it's
1949.
and
frankly,
that
case
intrigued
us
and
we
have
tried
to
apply
every
analysis
that
we
could
to
it
as
to
why
this
case
might
or
might
not
come
within
the
purview
of
that
case.
and
we
frankly
believe
that
this
case
does
come
within
the
--
what
the
court
describe
as
a
small
class
of
case
that
was
dealt
with
in
the
cohen-beneficial
industrial
case.
as
you
probably
recall
in
that,
that
was
a
suit
by
minority
stockholders
in
a
federal
district
court
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
after
the
case
had
been
filed,
new
jersey
adopted
a
statute
which
gave
the
defendant
corporation,
under
certain
circumstances,
the
right
to
require
security
for
cost.
the
statute
said
that
it
applied
to
pending
actions.
the
defendant
corporation
moved
to
have
the
cost
bond
made,
the
security
for
cost
made
and
the
trial
court
denied
it,
primarily
based
apparently
on
a
theory
that
the
new
jersey
statute
was
not
intended
to
be
applied
in
an
action
in
the
federal
court.
there
was
some
erie
railway
versus
tompkins
problems
in
it.
and
at
that
point,
having
denied
it,
the
corporation
is
faced
with
the
question
of,
can
we
go
up
now
or
do
we
have
to
wait
and
have
this
trial
happen
to
us
without
security
and
then
come
up?
is
this
the
final
decision?
it's
not
one
of
those
interlocutory
types
that
are
covered
by
section
1291
or
1292
that
deals
with
certain
types
of
injunction
receivership
orders
that
can
be
appealed
from
as
--
even
though
they
are
interlocutory
orders.
the
circuit
court
held
that
it
could
entertain
jurisdiction
and
held
that
the
trial
court
had
erred
that
this
statute
should
have
been
applied
in
the
federal
court
and
this
court
took
the
case
and
coming
at
considerable
length
and
discuss
in
great
detail
the
appealability
or
jurisdictional
aspect
of
it.
apparently,
there
really
weren't
any
disagreement
among
the
court
on
that
part.
there
was
a
disagreement,
a
dissent
as
to
whether
or
not
the
new
jersey
statute
was
such
a
statute
that
should
be
applied
in
the
federal
court
proceedings.
but
as
far
as
the
explanations
and
the
discussions
are
concerned,
we
have
excerpted
in
our
brief
and
in
the
appendix
the
total
portion
of
the
opinion
on
appealability
and
we've
tried
to
subject
the
present
case
to
an
analysis
as
to
each
of
the
factors.
and
frankly,
we
were
prejudiced,
i
will
admit,
in
what
we
hope
was
the
answer
but
we
feel
like
‘it
fits
to
a
t'
and
we
feel
that
actually
in
some
measure,
this
one
is
even
more
demanding
of
it
because
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
beyond
peradventure,
the
issue
is
not
even
subject
to
review
fully
by
the
state
court.
now,
i
don't
get
the
feeling
in
the
cohen
case
that
if
the
federal
district
judge
had
decided
to
change
his
mind
90
days
later
on
whether
he
would
require
security
for
cost
--
give
security
for
cost
that
the
court
would
have
been
powerless
to
do
so.
there
wasn't
any
inclination
that
he
was
going
to.
and
so
actually,
from
that
--
in
that
standpoint,
we
have
a
more
permanent
and
irrevocable
finality
established
by
virtue
of
the
peculiar
state
court
practice.
now,
you
can
say,
“well,
that's
state
court
practice
and
we're
not
governed
by
that”.
but
we're
in
the
state
court
and
we
have
to
deal
with
our
rights
with
reference
to
what
the
state
court
does
with
them
and
i
don't
--
we
don't
feel
that
we
have
a
complete
immunity
from
those
rules
with
respect
to
timeliness
of
appeal
and
preservation
of
our
rights.
it
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
here
the
last
time
about
--
well
what
if
this
--
we
don't
entertain
jurisdiction
and
this
matter
is
saved
and
brought
up
again,
where
will
it
would
be?
certainly,
the
state
court
by
its
own
determination
will
not
consider
the
venue
matter
again.
when
it
--
that
circumstance
should
happen,
if
it
should
happen
and
we
come
up
here
again,
we'll
have
kind
of
an
odd
situation
in
which
the
last
state
court
action
on
it
took
place
a
year
or
so
before.
and
i
think
someone
commented
before
that
there
would
be
a
good
deal
to
unscramble
at
that
stage.
now,
the
appellee
before
is
taking
the
position
and
i
think
probably
would
now
that
actually
they
would
like
to
have
this
question
settled,
realizing,
however,
that
this
court's
jurisdiction
can't
be
conferred
by
what
my
opponents
would
like
or
what
i
would
like
and
that
i
have
this
burden
of
showing
that
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction,
i
believe
that
it
does.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
that's
correct.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
the
comments
in
the
cohen
case
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
--
is
about
too
late
to
effectively
review
about
the
fact
that
if
they
didn't
get
the
right
to
see
whether
they
could
have
security
for
cost
until
after
they
had
already
incurred
the
cost,
it'd
be
somewhat
late
or
really
quite
strikingly
apt
here.
they're
quite
a
bit
like,
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
comments
in
the
swift
&
company
attachment
case
where
the
attachment
was
vacated
which
is
a
case
that's
cited
and
followed
the
cohen
case.
and
he
said
that
appellate
review
of
this
order
at
a
later
date
after
the
--
it
would
be
an
empty
right
after
the
vessel
had
been
released
in
the
restoration
of
the
attachment
only
theoretically
possible
that
it
is
somewhat
the
situation
we
ought
to
hear.
if
we
go
to
trial
in
austin,
and
it's
later
determined
that
we
weren't
required
to
go
there,
it'll
be
kind
of
apparent
victory
to
find
it
out
that
time
goes
--
it
would
have
already
happened.
and
neither
this
law
means,
we
don't
have
to
be
tried
twice
there,
i
don't
know
but
seriously,
that
feature
of
the
cohen
case
is
certainly
quite
appropriate.
now,
we've
done
the
best
we
could
to
check
the
comparable
statutes
in
the
cases
under
1257
dealing
with
appeals
coming
up
from
state
court
system
in
the
state
and
the
cases
that
come
up
from
the
other
side,
from
the
federal
side
and
we
haven't
been
able
to
find
any
reason
for
arriving
at
different
standards
on
this
area
of
finality.
in
radio
station
wow
versus
johnson
and
there
was
some
discussion
of
that
but
that
was
an
accounting
work.
and
one
issue
had
been
decided
but
it
was
still
accounting
and
the
court
went
ahead
and
heard
the
concluded
issue
of
the
case.
the
cases
are
numerous.
i
think
we
have
cited
most
of
them
here.
we
think
we
have.
the
montgomery
trade
council
case,
which
is
sometimes
cited
for
the
opposite
position,
involved
the
temporary
injunction
in
alabama,
but
there
they
had
the
--
you
were
faced
with
the
old
rule
of
gibbons
versus
ogden.
it
said
that
the
temporary
injunction
was
continuing
in
the
(inaudible)
of
the
court
and
that
it
might
very
well
take
it
up
at
anytime
and
that
it
was
in
contemplation
of
a
hearing
on
a
permanent
injunction.
and
--
but
the
--
i'll
cite
that
case
because
the
dissent
which
felt
that
the
real
issue
there
was
the
power
of
the
state
court
to
interfere
in
the
merits
that
was
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
i
think
pretty
well
have
been
settled
later
on
but
at
that
time,
it
was
still
a
crying
issue
was
really
what
has
been
involved
and
if
that
had
been
decided
very
finely,
and
it
took
a
comment
on
the
fact
that
these
things
had
to
be
given
a
practical
rather
than
a
technical
construction
and
commented
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
reason
why
you
should
have
one
standard
that's
going
to
the
federal
system
of
finality
and
another
system
when
it's
come
up
to
the
state
court
system.
many
of
the
cases
that
have
come
up
to
the
state
court
system
had
been
cases
where
the
judgment
of
the
highest
supreme
court
did
not
reverse
the
case
or
settled
it,
that
it
had
effective
remand
and
by
operation,
sometimes
a
state
practice.
some
cases
where
there
was
something
still
yet
to
be
done,
a
remittitur
problem.
we
don't
think
and
we'd
be
the
last
to
say
that
interlocutory
orders
per
se
should
be
brought
before
this
court.
the
texas
case
there
again
pointed
out
that
this
was
no
ordinary
interlocutory
order.
the
cohen
case
points
out
that
this
is
not
only
talking
about
opening
the
door
to
appeal
some
interlocutory
orders
generally,
not
talking
about
fragmentary
review,
piecemeal
review,
advisory
opinions
to
guide
the
court,
the
trial
court
as
it
goes
along.
we
are
not
here
on
that
type
of
case.
we
believe
that
there
is
always
ample
precedent
in
the
constructions
of
the
statutes
that
govern
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
recognize
jurisdiction
in
this
case
without
stretching
anything
that
has
been
done.
that
it
does
not
call
for
a
new
exception
at
all,
it
calls
for
a
recognition
of
an
application
of
the
cohen
rule
as
we
call
it
and
that
type
of
thing
which
there
again
was
not
the
first
in
this
area.
the
accounting
cases
had
come
on
long
before
the
cases
of
that
type
where
there
still
were
things
to
be
done
in
other
aspects
of
the
litigation
but
not
related.
i
apologize
for
belaboring
at
such
a
detail
the
jurisdiction
point,
but
i
say
again
if
i
--
if
i
don't
have
jurisdiction
and
everything
else,
i
have
to
say
it's
--
it's
(inaudible).
the
basic
statute,
federal
statute
on
which
we
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
sure.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
this
is
a
georgia
case.
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
frankly,
i've
forgotten
it.
i
read,
it
but
i've
forgotten
it.
i
can
tell
you
something
else
but
that's
the
truth
and
i
--
that
i
just
don't
recall
it
at
this
time.
they
--
mr.
hubert
d.
johnson
i
gather
that.
i
think
so
and
i
will.
the
basic
thing
on
which
the
national
banks
were
basing
their
right
was
the
provision
of
what
was
section
57
of
the
national
bank
act
of
1864
and
it
was
carried
forward
as
a
part
of
section
5198
of
the
revised
statutes
when
they
revised
under
the
1873
authorized
revision.
and
nowadays,
you'll
find
it
in
12
u.s.c.
94.
this
1940
edition
at
least
carries
it
at
that
place.
this
statute
is
--
we
think
it's
really
quite
clear
on
its
face
it
--
the
reading
of
it
--
we
set
it
out
in
full,
doesn't
seem
that
it
ought
not
cause
so
much
concern
as
to
the
construction
of
it.
it
says,
actions
and
proceedings
against
national
banks
maybe
had
in
any
district
or
territorial
court
of
the
united
states
held
within
the
district
in
which
such
association
may
be
established
or
in
any
state
county
or
municipal
court
in
the
county
or
city
in
which
such
association
is
located
having
jurisdiction
in
similar
cases.
now,
in
our
brief
we've
gone
over
all
of
the
cases
in
this
court
and
few
in
some
other
courts
that
have
construed
this
statute.
the
--
beginning
with
the
bethel
case
that
involved
a
connecticut
proceeding.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
connecticut
courts
could
entertain
one
against
the
national
banks,
they
said
that
they
could.
the
casey
v.
adams
which
was
a
state
court
proceeding
up
from
louisiana's
highest
court
held
that
--
with
respect
to
the
statute,
it
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
an
interim
action,
a
type
of
local
action
that
there's
been
known
there,
as
long
as
there'd
been
actions.
that
being
a
peculiarly
local
action
from
the
very
description
of
it,
the
opinion
is
very
short.
you
can
see
that
that
was
what
was
there.
the
main
case
and
the
one
that
we
think
was
being
controlling
and
which
we've
based
our
rights
was
this
first
national
bank
of
charlotte,
north
carolina
versus
morgan,
that
arose
in
the
early
1880s
and
was
decided
in
this
court
in
1889
and
it
was
a
suit,
in
the
state
court
in
north
carolina
where
the
bank
was
sued
away
from
its
home
county
but
it
didn't
raise
its
rights
until
it
--
he
lost.
then
it
raised
its
rights
saying
that
there
was
complete
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court
out
in
their
outlying
county
where
it
had
been
heard.
the
opinion
in
that
case
was
written
by
the
first
mr.
justice
harlan.
looks
like
i'm
thinking
on
the
harlan
cases
a
little
bit,
but
that's
the
way
the
thing
worked
out.
that
opinion
had
occasion
then
to
say,
was
this
so
jurisdictional
that
it
could
be
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
what
did
the
statute's
proper
right
did
it
grant?
and
the
court
said
that
it
was
not
a
jurisdiction
statute,
that
it
was
a
personal
privilege
which
if
it
had
been
asserted,
it
must
have
been
recognized.
now,
that
opinion
is
--
the
opponents
don't
like
it.
they
say
that
it's
a
dictum
because
it
didn't
have
to
go
so
far.
but
we
think
that
they
had
then
--
in
saying
what
the
statute
was
not,
they
said
what
it
was,
which
is
not
an
uncommon
way
of
answering
the
question.
and
the
answer
was
already
quite
clear
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
they
hadn't
said
at
least
that
much
then
the
statute
was
totally
and
completely
meaningless.
the
state
courts
have
gone
off
all
around
the
clock
on
it.
they
have
said
that
it
was
a
mere
permissive
thing,
meaning
that
the
court
could
grant
it
if
they
wanted
to
or
could
not
grant
it
if
they
didn't
want
to.
they
didn't
--
well
that's
not
much
of
a
right
and
it
doesn't
mean
anything
if
it
says
that.
if
it
just
means
that
they
may
grant
it
or
not
as
this
trial
court
sees
fit
to
do,
then
it
wasn't
worth
having
the
statute
about
it.
and
we
have
discussed
that
point
and
it's
been
discussed
very
thoroughly
in
a
number
of
state
courts
and
it
had
been
discussed
in
a
couple
of
circuit
courts
of
appeals
cases
but
except
by
inference,
it
wasn't
discussed
here
in
the
morgan
case.
it
was
saying
that
if
it
had
been
claimed,
it
must
have
been
recognized
which
certainly
is
mandatory
type
of
language.
in
the
casey
v.
adams,
if
it
was
just
a
main
type
of
thing
and
they
didn't
need
to
go
into
the
matter
whether
it
was
a
local
or
a
transitory
action.
the
--
in
1923,
in
a
case,
bank
of
america
versus
whitney
central
bank,
this
court
did
not
have
occasion
to
actually
consider
the
matter
because
of
the
fact
that
from
the
brief
in
the
case
you
can
see
that
it
was
never
asserted.
the
banks
were
claiming
there
that
--
the
bank
there
was
claiming
that
it
was
not
subject
to
process
from
the
jurisdiction
because
it
was
not
located
there.
by
on
this
side,
the
court
said
that
if
anybody
had
ever
wanted
to
point
out
this
other
matter
that
even
if
they've
been
subject
to
process,
it
might
have
been
that
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
be
sued
in
their
home
county,
citing
the
morgan
case
and
the
statutes
on
which
it's
based.
now,
we've
given
a
little
bit
of
attention
to
the
state
court
cases
but
nothing
tremendous
because
they
are
confused.
some
of
them
have
gone
off
on
the
theory
that
this
has
--
it
referenced
only
to
this
limited
type
of
action
where
a
bank
was
being
sued
for
the
penalty
for
having
charge
usurious
interest
which
apparently
was
based
on
the
legislative
coincidence
that
in
the
1875
corrective
act,
they
put
back
something
that
had
been
omitted
and
put
it
back
at
the
last
part
of
a
section
that
had
dealt
with
the
penalty
for
charging
usurious
in
--
for
national
bank
charging
usurious
interest.
but
the
language
of
the
statute
is
quite
clear
that
it
refers
to
actions
and
proceedings
against
national
banks,
any
one
in
this
title
and
the
whole
title
there
is
about
national
banks.
that
was
not
the
rationale
in
the
morgan
case.
it
was
not
the
rationale
in
the
casey
v.
adams
and
it's
been
completely
explained
away
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
leonardi
case
and
in
the
buffum
case,
true
both
of
those
are
cases
that
involved
proceedings
filed
in
the
federal
district
court.
but
they're
talking
about
the
same
statute
and
could
have
that
limitation
to
usury
claims
in
federal
--
in
state
courts,
it
would
have
been
the
same
thing
for
federal
courts
because
the
same
problem
was
there.
that
i
think
has
been
pretty
well
laid
at
rest.
some
of
them
had
gone
off.
the
cases
had
fall
on
the
other
category
on
the
conclusion
that
this
was
a
local
action.
well,
they
had
basis
in
those
cases
on
casey
v.
adams.
casey
v.
adams
has
not
been
overruled.
it
has
not
been
expanded
by
this
court
to
cover
more
than
the
true
interim
proceeding.
the
argument
has
been
made
in
some
of
the
cases
--
been
made
in
the
briefs
here
by
the
appellee
that
there
was
a
proviso
to
section
4
of
an
act
in
1882
that
partially
or
wholly
repealed
this
section
57
of
the
national
bank
act
of
the
1864
act.
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
that
in
some
detail
and
in
large
upon
what
we
had
originally
by
a
supplemental
brief
which
we
think
shows
beyond
question
that
the
1882
proviso
was
directed
exclusively
at
a
jurisdiction
problem
that
arose
out
of
the
amendment
of
the
judiciary
act
in
1875
that
gave
general
federal
question
jurisdiction
in
national
banks
having
this
federal
origin
status.
we're
therefore
in
a
position
to
practically
eliminate
the
concurrent
state
court
jurisdiction.
we
cite
four
or
five
cases
that
have
gone
--
that
had
analyzed
carefully
this
1882
act
and
its
follow
up
acts
of
1887
and
1888
which
have
carried
forward
in
the
judiciary
code
in
1911
and
then
rewritten
again
in
the
judiciary
code
of
1948
which
seems
to
us
to
thoroughly
exhaust
the
subject
and
thoroughly
establish
what
the
statutory
language
itself
established
that
it
was
addressed
strictly
to
the
matter
of
preventing
this
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
because
it
was
for
all
practical
purposes
exclusive
as
long
as
this
free
right
of
removal
existed,
that
is
if
you
have
the
$500
amount
in
controversy.
and
that
meant
that
this
was
a
problem
where
the
intention
of
giving
any
state
court
jurisdiction
was
being
afforded.
and
that's
all
that
that
those
--
that
statute
was
about
and
the
language
of
it
shows
it.
the
cases
of
this
court
over
the
next
25
years
after
it
was
passed
show
it.
it
has
been
discussed
very,
very
carefully
by
this
court
in
the
petri
case
and
in
the
continental
national
bank
versus
buford.
it
was
also
discussed
and
noticed
in
the
van
reed
versus
people's
bank
in
1905
which
involved
the
matter
of
attachments
issuing
out
of
a
state
court
against
a
national
bank
which
had
been
a
matter
that
was
covered
by
section
57
as
it
had
been
amended
in
1873.
they
were
really
into
the
same
area
there
although
it's
true
with
a
different
point
of
impact.
but
all
those
cases
show,
it
seem
to
me,
if
so
thoroughly
develop
the
legislative
purpose
and
intention
of
that
as
its
language
shows
that
frankly
one
of
the
reasons
we
didn't
give
it
as
much
attention
in
the
original
brief
was,
we
didn't
think
it
was
--
merited
a
great
deal
of
attention
but
it
had
been
the
subject
of
good
deal
discussion
here
before
so
we
thought
maybe
--
maybe
it
would
be
better
to
enlarged
a
little
bit
upon
it.
on
this
local
action
matter,
there
was
an
argument
made
here
before
to
the
fact
that
the
state
statute
that
created
the
insurance
--
of
the
insurance
code
and
particularly
this
section
of
the
1955
act
that
gave
this
right
of
venue
to
the
receiver
in
the
county
or
in
the
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
where
the
delinquency
proceeding
is
pending,
was
intended
to
create
a
local
action.
it
did
create
a
statutory
local
action.
at
that
time,
we
said
and
we
say
again
that
casey
versus
adams,
seems
to
us
makes
it
quite
clear
that
they're
talking
about
what
is
really
a
local
action
and
not
one
that
it
just
labeled
such.
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
rather
after
he
pointed
out
that
if
you
can
just
put
the
label
on
it,
then
they
can
just
go
back
and
amend
the
statute
and
say
that
any
action
we
bring
is
the
local
action
and
therefore
we've
eliminated
the
federal
law.
it's
not
that
--
that
shouldn't
that
simple.
and
so
the
label
is
not
controlling
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
there's
nothing
in
the
insurance
code
and
nothing
in
this
section
that
purported
to
create
any
action.
it
dealt
with
actions
that
arose
out
of
transactions
with
the
company
before
it
went
into
receivership.
this
very
pleading
shows
here
that
they're
based
on
actions
that
go
back
to
1950
in
a
so-called
grand
conspiracy
that's
extended
from
1950
to
1957.
they're
talking
about
a
1955
act
and
the
1957
receivership.
and
it
was
not
intended
to
be
a
local
action.
at
that
time,
there
was
mention
of
the
fact
that
there
has
been
--
was
pending
in
the
texas
supreme
court
a
case
which
would
involve
a
construction
whether
this
was
a
mandatory
type
of
provision
or
what
in
this
section
4
(f)
of
article
21.28
of
the
insurance
code
of
texas.
that
case
has
since
been
decided,
and
that
case
and
we
quote
from
in
our
supplemental
brief
is
burke
versus
--
burke
investment
company
versus
langdeau.
and
they
point
out
there
that
it
was
a
merely
permissive,
a
place
that
the
receiver
could
bring
an
action,
not
the
place
that
he
had
to
bring
an
action.
it's
clear
from
that
case
that
the
receiver
could
bring
an
action
against
these
national
banks
in
a
district
state
court
in
dallas.
it
is
clear
that
he
could
bring
an
action
anywhere
he
wanted
to.
he
might
have
some
of
them
changed
under
local
rules
of
venue
if
these
people
had
local
rights.
this
was
not
a
must
statute
but
the
main
thing
i
pointed
out
in
that
case
was
that
in
the
discussion
of
it,
in
no
way
suggested
that
it
had
anything
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
action.
it's
strictly
pertains
to
venue
and
it
was
permissive
at
that.
they
had
a
case
there
involving
the
--
where
a
land
suit
had
been
brought
where
the
land
was
and
the
receiver
said,
“no,
it
has
to
be
brought
here
where
i
am”,
which
one
of
them
controls.
the
1955
when
was
later
in
time,
if
it
was
mandatory,
perhaps
it
superseded
the
other
and
held
that
it
was
not.
both
of
them
are
local
venue
statutes
in
texas.
they're
not
concerned
with
the
nature
of
the
action
really
basically
even
in
the
land
suit
in
texas.
the
party
being
sued
has
to
set
up
this
plea
of
privilege
or
else
the
court
has
jurisdiction.
the
local
action
argument,
we
didn't
think
had
too
much
before
and
in
the
light
of
what
the
texas
supreme
court
has
said
since
then
and
which
is
covered
in
a
supplemental
brief,
we
think
now
it
really
completely
falls.
i
want
to
save
some
time
for
my
--
the
counsel
in
the
other
case
to
close
and
if
there're
no
questions
at
this
time,
i'll
relinquish
that
the
appellee
move.
