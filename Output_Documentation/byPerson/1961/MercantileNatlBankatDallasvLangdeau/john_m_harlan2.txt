of
course,
the
fact
that
this
is
final
under
the
texas
law,
it
doesn't
mean
that
it's
final.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
section
is
that?
is
that
in
the
code?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
was
this
argument
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
order
under
texas
law
might
be
final.
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
this
final
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
--
you
got
another
--
i
take
a
very
favorable
view
of
cohen
too
because
i
represented
the
prevailing
party
in
that
case.
but
you
got
another
factor
in
it.
and
that
is
when
you
come
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
i
suppose
the
underlying
premise
of
your
argument
would
be
that
congress
intended
to
protect
these
banks,
national
banks
by
reason
of
this
venue
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
if
you're
not
allowed
to
appeal
now,
the
very
purpose,
assuming
you're
right
on
the
merits
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
or
the
ruling
of
this
court
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
--
what's
the
effect
of
that
langdeau
case
then
that
says
it's
permissive?
as
i
understand
the
case,
it
says
it's
permissive
only
in
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it
would
yield
to
another
mandatory
jurisdiction
--
mandatory
venue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
--
if
you
have
to
sue
again
in
dallas,
there's
no
way
you
can
bring
under
your
law,
no
way
you
can
bring
in
these
other
defendants?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
none.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
your
--
was
this
case
decided
by
your
supreme
court
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
before
or
after
langdeau?
justice
john
m.
harlan
before.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
takes
a
little
of
the
bloom
of
your
equity.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
there
seems
to
be
a
diametrical
difference
of
view
between
you
and
your
colleague.
i
put
this
same
question
to
him
and
he
answered
me
categorically.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought,
maybe
i
mistook
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
texas
law
carry
on
the
subject
to
--
also
to
answer
a
simple
question
as
to
whether
or
not
if
you
prevail
--
if
you
prevail
this
action,
the
entire
action
could
be
transferred
to
dallas?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
each
of
you
shakes
his
head
whenever
the
question
is
asked
and
i'm
terribly
confused
about
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
view
of
the
texas
law
is
confusing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
permits.
justice
john
m.
harlan
says
no
