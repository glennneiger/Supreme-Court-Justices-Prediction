mr.
neth
l.
leachman
if
your
honors
please,
i
would
like
to
go
back
first
and
elaborate
a
little
on
the
nature
of
this
case
purely
from
the
pleading
standpoint.
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
below.
it
was
all
agreed
and
it's
all
a
matter
of
record
these
pleas
of
privilege
controverting
affidavit
in
the
complaint.
so
any
statements
made
by
counsel
outside
of
the
pleadings
are,
of
course,
not
in
the
record.
they
went
a
little
far,
went
to
brazil
out
of
the
record
that
i
don't
think
that'll
be
--
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
go
out
of
the
record
and
i
only
intend
to.
the
plea
--
the
petition
shows
that
this
is
a
suit,
and
i
say
this
deliberately
and
not
in
--
with
any
malicious
thought
that
this
is
a
monstrosity,
this
suit.
and
i
want
to
tell
you
what
it
is.
it's
144
defendants
that
this
--
that
this
receiver
is
sued
allover
texas
in
the
united
states
and
some
in
england
and
which
the
general
theme
running
throughout
this
complaint
is
this,
“that
this
ict
insurance
company
was
organized
in
1950”.
they
said
when
it
was
organized,
it
was
insolvent.
that
at
all
times
from
1950
to
1957,
when
it
was
put
in
to
receivership
and
a
state
liquidator
for
insurance
companies
took
it
over,
that
it
was
insolvent.
that
all
of
these
people
that
had
dealings
with
it
over
this
period
of
seven
years,
know
--
knew
that
it
was
insolvent
and
that
their
transactions
with
this
insurance
company
were
made
with
the
ulterior
motive
and
purpose
of
keeping
it
head
above
water,
so
to
speak
so
that
it
could
continue
to
commit
frauds
on
stockholders,
policyholders
and
the
public
at
large.
that
puts
these
two
banks
in
the
position
of
--
of
dealing
with
an
insurance
company
under
the
pleadings.
that
it
knew
to
be
insolvent,
lending
it
money
from
time
to
time.
and
they
do
ordinary
course
of
the
banking
business,
knowing
that
it
was
insolvent,
not
lending
it
the
money
as
a
pure
banking
transaction
to
get
interest
on
the
money
but
to
keep
this
broke
insurance
company
alive
so
it
could
commit
vast
frauds
on
--
on
the
public
at
large.
now,
with
144
defendants
in
the
case
and
each
one
conspiring
with
each
other,
i
ask
an
actuary
to
tell
me
just
how
many
conspiracies
that
would
be.
and
he
came
up
with
an
astronomical
figure
that
was
greater
than
mr.
glen's
argument.
it
was
22
with
six
figures
behind
it
and
then
trillion,
trillion,
trillion
conspiracies.
now,
we
are
asked
to
--
these
two
banks
are
subpoenaed
to
come
down
to
austin,
texas
to
bring
their
attorney
with
them,
to
bring
an
officer
with
them,
to
bring
their
records
with
them
and
sit
there
throughout
that
kind
of
a
trial.
i
don't
know
how
long
it
would
take.
no
member
of
this
court
could
--
could
guess
how
long
it
would
take.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
dallas.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
yes.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
austin,
texas.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
yes,
it's
200
miles.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
200
miles
south
of
(inaudible)
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
it's
in
dallas,
too.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
both
these
banks
are
in
dallas.
now,
if
you
have
to
go
down
there
and
engage
in
that
sort
of
a
--
i'm
on
the
same
mileage.
it
would
tremendously
expensive
because
every
member
of
this
court
knows
that
clients
pay
their
attorneys
expenses
when
they're
out
of
town
on
their
business
and
don't
pay
it
when
they're
in
town
on
their
business.
now,
if
they
tried
it
in
dallas,
they
wouldn't
have
any
--
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
sir?
no,
i'm
getting
to
the
irreparable
entry
that's
mentioned
in
some
of
the
--
this
court's
decisions
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
and
it
would
be
quite
an
inconvenience
to
put
it
most
mileage
as
to
have
to
go
down
there.
and
in
the
morgan
case,
the
--
the
--
this
court
said
that
it's
--
it
assumed
that
it
was
passed
for
the
standpoint
of
convenience
over
the
banks.
it
could
see
no
other
reason
for
it.
now
--
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
no,
sir.
we
don't
permit
branch
banking
in
texas,
your
honor.
so,
that
covers
the
--
the
--
the
nature
of
the
case.
and
you
can
see
that
if
this
court
should
decline
jurisdiction
and
we
are
forced
to
go
to
austin,
texas
to
try
this
case
that
there
certainly
will
be
irreparable
entry
and
damage
because
if
we
prevail,
if
we
won
after
such
a
proceeding
is
there,
we
couldn't
recover
our
attorneys,
our
attorneys
fees
or
our
expenses
down
there
or
expenses
of
our
officers
down
there
which
we
wouldn't
be
put
to
and
in
dallas.
and
it's
not
just
an
ordinary
lawsuit.
this
is
an
extraordinary
proceeding,
the
like
of
which,
i've
never
been
in
before.
and
i've
been
in
the
business
about
40
years
and
longer.
so,
i
get
back
to
the
--
it's
our
position
and
feeling
as
we
read
the
law
and
we've
studied
it
carefully
and
i
fear
these
gentlemen
have
to.
but
as
we
read
the
law,
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
appeal
and
for
the
--
if
we
read
the
law
correctly,
if
it
accepts
jurisdiction
and
hears
the
case
on
the
merits,
we
have
no
concern
about
this
honorable
body
here
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
section
94
of
that
statute
is
valid
in
force
and
effect
and
it
requires
its
mandatory
and
it
requires
that
the
venue
privilege
that
were
asserted
by
these
two
banks
be
sustained
as
to
the
banks
and
the
suit
as
to
them
move
to
dallas
county.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
your
honor,
that
is
a
very
strained
technical
analysis
--
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
--
of
these
statutes
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
follow
them
very
far
in
it.
i
know
this
--
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
--
that
--
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir
i
--
i
understand
that.
i
know
of
this,
that
the
1864
statute
is
clear
and
non-ambiguous.
and
i
know
that
you
don't
resort
to
history
to
--
to
determine
the
meaning
of
a
statute
if
it's
clear
and
non
--
non-ambiguous.
and
the
statute
is
there
on
the
books.
it
was
--
it's
been
on
the
books
since
1864.
and
where
the
confusion
arises
and
they
inject
confusion
into
the
picture
because
they
don't
differentiate
between
jurisdiction
and
venue.
they're
two
entirely
different
things.
and
they
even
inject
into
their
arguments
of
the
--
the
question
of
capacity
to
sue.
for
example,
in
your
--
in
your
1864
statute,
you
had
--
you
had
12
u.s.
code
section
24
which
deals
along
with
capacity
to
sue.
and
that's
the
question
that
your
honor
asked
yesterday,
capacity
to
sue.
they
can
sue
and
be
sued.
now,
the
venue
statute
in
1864,
section
94
of
1957
as
it
was
then.
it
gave
to
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
and
the
second
clause
gave
to
the
state
courts
--
it
gave
to
the
federal
courts,
provided
the
juris
--
the
venue
for
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
and
provided
for
the
venue
of
the
state
courts
in
the
suits
brought
in
the
state
court.
we
--
their
--
their
assumption
is
--
is
reached
based
on
the
good
deal
of
speculation
on
what
they
think
congress
had
in
mind.
they
suspect
that
congress
had
this
in
mind.
and
it's
in
their
brief.
i
don't
know
how
they
can
look
into
congress'
mind
except
from
the
written
result
of
what
congress
came
up
with.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
in
1863,
your
honor,
i
believe
and
then
it
was
in
1864
and
then
it
was
left
out
of
one
enactment
and
then
passed
about
a
year
later,
i
believe.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
yes,
yes.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
when
it
was
brought
forward,
i
haven't
traced
it,
your
honor,
as
to
--
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
yes.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
in
1926
--
in
1926,
it
was
brought
forward.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
in
the
national
bank
section.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
yes,
sir.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
yes.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
that's
the
u.s.
code
that
was
rewritten
in
1926
that
we're
talking
about.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
codification.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
codification
of
all
federal
--
yes.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
yes.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
no
--
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
well,
we're
--
we
just
differ
on
it
then,
your
honor.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
we
could
find
it
out.
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
sir?
mr.
neth
l.
leachman
that's
right.
nor
we
don't
agree
with
them
on
that.
now,
we've
gone
over,
rather
thoroughly,
the
question
about
how
final
this
matter
is.
and
of
course,
the
--
the
federal
courts
are
not
bound
by
state
rulings
on
finality
of
the
judgment.
we
concede
that
but
how
final
can
anything
be?
you
are
looking
at
it
from
your
view
point.
is
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
finding?
forget
about
what
the
text
has
said.
you
change
--
if
change
be
reviewed
again
in
texas
where
we
--
we
can't
go
back
there
and
ask
anybody
to
--
to
review
that
question
again.
you
go
from
the
trial
court
on
that
and
the
supreme
court
and
you
can't
get
it
reviewed
again.
so,
if
we
were
to
come
back
here
at
a
later
date,
we
couldn't
come
back
here
in
a
different
complexion
or
status
then
we
are
out
of
date.
it
would
still
be
the
very
same
record
and
the
very
same
situation
that
this
final
question
on
venue.
now
venue,
in
this
case,
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
merits.
and
you
go
into
the
merits,
it's
--
they're
not
going
to
mention
the
--
the
venue
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
merits.
so,
it
is
on
this
question
that
involves
the
federal
right
of
these
banks
to
be
sued
in
the
county
of
their
locale.
it's
the
sole
question
here
before
this
court.
and
it's
a
valuable
right.
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
has
--
has
held
in
effect.
i
won't
look
for
the
opinion
to
quote
it
exactly.
but
they
held
that
this
question
of
venue
was
once
exclusively
within
the
area
of
jurisdiction
so
to
speak
or
--
or
this
exclusive
decision
of
--
of
the
texas
courts.
and
that
the
--
that
this
question
and
we
are
insulated
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
this
question.
well,
if
we
--
if
we
are,
then
this
statute
is
repealed
by
judicial
legislation
and
there's
no
relief
that
can
--
can
come
to
--
to
an
injured
party
that
has
the
right.
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
asking
yesterday
if
we
would
go
over
the
state
court
decisions
that
were
cited
for
adversaries
in
this
case.
and
i
don't
have
much
time
but
i
--
i
have
just
a
few
more
minutes.
and
i'll
--
i'll
attempt
to
--
they're
distinguishable,
had
great
of
them
are.
the
austin
court
of
civil
appeals
made
a
statement
in
--
in
a
very
brief
language
what
they
involved
and
that
is
--
that
court's
notation
was
--
was
correct
about
it.
it
said
this,
that
their
decisions
involved
one,
only
usury
cases.
well
now,
the
--
the
usury
case
distinction
has
been
repudiated
in
leonardi
versus
chase
national
in
the
second
cir
--
circuit
with
this
court
denying
certiorari.
they
said
they
were
applicable
only
in
transitory
cases.
and
three,
that
it
is
permissive.
well,
this
court
can
determine
as
well
as
the
state
court
whether
it's
permissive.
but
some
of
them
held
it
was
permissive.
then
they
held
that
it
was
repealed
in
section
1348
supra.
now,
in
the
international
refugee
case
by
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
1949,
they
answered
that
--
that
question.
and
it
also
is
--
was
answered
in
the
buffum
case,
decided
contrary
in
the
buffum
case
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
repealed.
now,
the
--
the
fifth
distinction
was
a
single
new
jersey
court
in
the
cassatt
case
wherein
the
--
the
court
there
in
new
jersey
said,
“we're
inclined
to
think
that
the
direct
application
of
the
statute
is
jurisdic
--
as
--
is
to
jurisdiction
and
that
it
is
not
in
such
potent
control
of
venue
as
to
be
imperative
in
the
present
case.
so
that's
the
--
that's
the
way
those
cases
fall.
now,
there
are
several
of
them,
i
have
notes
here
on
what
each
one
holds.
and
now,
i
won't
have
time
to
go
over
it,
but
i'll
say
this,
that
they
--
they
don't
sustain
our
adversaries
in
the
way
that
they
say
they
do
because
at
least
two
of
them
in
there
hold
that
it's
mandatory
to
the
cases
they
cite,
hold
that
it's
mandatory.
and
then
there
were
some
waiver
cases
in
there
where
they
have
waived
it.
and
then
there
was
one
where
they
claim
they
we're
stopped
to
--
to
assert
it.
so,
those
--
those
cases
don't
--
don't
help
them
as
much
as
they
would
like
for
them
to.
for
example,
this
iowa
case
that
they
cite.
that
was
a
state
law
fixing
super
headed
liability
of
a
stockholder
of
a
state
bank.
and
the
national
bank
apparently
was
one
of
the
stockholders
and
has
held
there
that
it
was
a
local
action
statute
created
the
cause
of
action,
it
was
not
a
common
law
liability.
and
as
to
--
as
to
our
case
--
whether
or
not
it's
a
local
action,
i
don't
think
it
could
be
any
question
about
it.
and
i
--
i
would
think
that
this
court
can
certainly
pass
on
that
--
that
question
because
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
mentioned,
if
a
state
legislature
can
make
a
local
action
out
of
any
kind
of
action
that
it
sees
fit
to
then
it
can
effectively
repeal
the
force
and
effect
of
this
venue
statute.
if
casey
versus
adams
is
the
--
is
the
--
the
law.
thank
you
very
much.
