justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
have
to
unscramble
an
awful
lot
of
eggs
though,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
my
point
is,
apparently,
you
and
counsel
for
the
other
side
would
see
eye
to
eye
as
to
this
possibility
of
transferring
the
whole
cause
to
dallas.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
adversary
said
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
you
prevail,
they
are
burdened
to
have
two
actions.
there's
no
way
of
taking
the
140
individuals
and
bringing
the
action
against
them
in
the
same
courtroom
with
the
two
banks
in
dallas.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
we
have
to
examine
this
whole
volume
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
new
cases
you
mentioned?
