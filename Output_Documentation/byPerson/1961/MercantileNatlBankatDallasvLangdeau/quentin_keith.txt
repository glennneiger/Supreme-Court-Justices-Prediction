mr.
quentin
keith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
quentin
keith
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
would
give
to
your
honors
just
a
little
background
on
the
factual
aspects
of
this
matter
because
unlike
most
cases
that
you
have
before
you,
this
case
has
never
been
tried.
we
have
been
through
all
of
the
courts
of
texas.
and
there,
there
hasn't
a
court
union
yet
the
trying
to
file
in
we're
going
to
try
this
lawsuit.
the
two
banks
here
are
on
the
two
defendants
that
were
involved
in
a
--
in
a
large
case.
there
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
ben
jack
cage,
a
certainly
co-conspirator
whom
we
allege
conceive
the
idea
of
forming
a
labor
union,
by
forming
an
insurance
company
to
be
owned
by
labor
unions
which
was
an
excellent
idea
except
that
ben
jack
cage
apparently
had
large
in
his
heart
rather
than
a
public
spirited
undertaking.
mr.
cage
had
occasion
to
appear
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
and
unsuccessfully
appealing
his
10-year
conviction
and
is
now
taking
sanctuary
in
brazil.
the
banks
being
sued
as
co-conspirators
and
being
in
--
we
allege
that
there
are
stopped
to
deny
that
they
have
not
waived
their
right
to
the
federal
venue
statute
and
then
let
me
say
at
the
very
outset
of
this,
if
i
may,
sir,
that
we
make
no
contention
here
and
i've
never
made
any
contention
that
this
court
cannot
review
state
court
action
relating
to
federal
statute.
we
make
no
contention
or
did
the
state
made
any
contention
that
the
--
the
national
banks
here
are
to
be
deprived
of
anything.
i
may
say
i
make
a
further
concession
here,
sir.
i
do
not
say
that
this
--
that
we
can
confer
jurisdiction
on
a
court
by
agreement.
but
i
do
agree
with
counsel
that
under
texas
practice,
for
all
purposes
and
i
emphasize
the
word
all,
for
all
purposes,
the
determination
of
a
venue
issue
is
now
final
in
texas.
it
is
not
final
should
this
court
determine
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction
here.
i
think
that
that
case
can
be
brought
along
and
eventually
reach
this
court
at
the
conclusion
of
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
but
i
say
to
your
honors
that
insofar
as
texas
courts
are
concerned,
the
venue
question
will
never
be
litigated
regardless
of
whether
this
court
takes
the
jurisdiction
assuming
it
denied
the
jurisdictional
question
that
they
did
not
take
jurisdiction.
so
far
as
texas
law
is
concern
we
are
through
litigating.
mr.
quentin
keith
yes,
sir?
mr.
quentin
keith
yes,
sir.
mr.
quentin
keith
yes,
sir.
mr.
quentin
keith
i
think
so,
sir,
because
what
we
are
--
what
we
have
here
now
is
the
interlocutory
judgment
under
our
practice.
it
has
settled
the
venue
issue
but
it
is
still
an
interlocutory
judgment.
we
can
only
have
one
final
judgment
in
our
--
in
our
practice
--
mr.
quentin
keith
--
which
will
be
the
one
at
the
end
of
the
road.
mr.
quentin
keith
no,
sir.
not
again
--
mr.
quentin
keith
well,
i
think
it
poses
a
procedural
dilemma
that
i
cannot
answer
and
--
mr.
quentin
keith
well
--
mr.
quentin
keith
i
want
to
be
as
frank
as
i
can
with
your
honors.
mr.
quentin
keith
i
say
in
the
city
of
wichita
--
the
wichita
falls
railroad
case,
the
mcdonnell,
its
in
141
texas
holds
flat
out
and
plainly
nonequivocally
that
the
decision
of
on
a
hearing,
on
a
plea
of
privilege
by
an
appellate
court
and
in
this
case,
the
last
appellate
that
will
review
it
is
final
and
binding
and
will
not
be
reviewed
upon
a
subsequent
hearing.
it
--
it
then
becomes
res
judicata
insofar
as
venue
is
concerned.
mr.
quentin
keith
no,
sir.
no.
we
don't
have
business
that
we
waived
down
there,
sir.
mr.
quentin
keith
your
venue
questions
are
there.
you
file
your
plea
of
privilege,
it
must
be
controvert,
you
file
what's
known
as
a
controverting
affidavit.
that
it
comes
on
for
hearing
if
that
it
adversely
determined
to
either
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant,
if
that
is
to
see
if
it
is
transferred
over
the
plaintiff's
objection
or
if
it
is
retained
over
the
defendant's
objection.
the
losing
party
has
20
days
will
then
which
--
mr.
quentin
keith
in
which
to
appeal
for
practice
appeal.
mr.
quentin
keith
if
--
that
is
right.
mr.
quentin
keith
no,
sir.
mr.
quentin
keith
i
don't
say
texas.
mr.
quentin
keith
i
said
this
court
plea.
mr.
quentin
keith
that's
those
--
i
don't
think
that
whatever
we
call
it
a
final
judgment
down
there
can't
preclude
this
court
from
eventually
reviewing
that
decision.
i'll
say
the
--
mr.
quentin
keith
yes.
and
i
say
for
venue,
we're
now
at
the
end
of
the
road.
but
--
mr.
quentin
keith
you
--
yes,
sir.
you
would
have
a
record
that
would
be
that
they
can
instead
of
an
--
mr.
quentin
keith
that's
accepts
in
substance
what
they
would
say
if
there
is
a
remaining
federal
question,
the
court
--
the
court
in
washington
will
undoubtedly
seize
the
broad
and
then
review
it.
now
sir,
i
made
--
did
i
make
myself
clear?
i
don't
want
to
create
or
try
to
create
jurisdiction
by
agreement
but
i
don't
want
to
try
to
talk
to
this
court
into
a
local
practice
situation
here
that
will
leave
us
both
in
doubt
as
to
where
we
are.
now,
in
this
case,
if
i
may
say
to
your
honors,
we
have
concluded
here
that
this
court
has
before
it
now
for
the
first
time
since
the
national
banking
act
was
passed
nearly
100
ago,
the
--
the
final
and
then
the
ultimate
determination
to
make
whether
this
is
a
venue
or
it's
a
jurisdictional
or
whether
it's
a
mandatory
statute.
first,
before
we
get
to
that
section
94,
i
want
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
section
24
of
article
or
section
12
of
the
u.s.
code.
national
banks
shall
have
the
right
to
sue
and
be
sued,
complain
and
defend
in
any
court
of
law
and
equity
as
fully
as
natural
person.
now,
what
did
the
bank
seek
here?
it's
just
exactly
what
ben
jack
cage
sought
in
brazil.
they
want
sanctuary
and
in
texas
we
have
no
such
thing
as
branch
banking.
a
bank
sets
up
business
in
dallas
goes
out
and
tries
to
do
business
all
over
the
state.
if
this
there's
the
law
as
they
contend
for
that
you
can
only
sue
in
the
county
in
which
they
are
a
domicile
then
they
have
sanctuary
but
they
can
go
from
el
paso
to
orange
or
they
can
go
from
texarkana
to
el
paso
from
--
from
amarillo
to
galveston
seeking
business
but
regards
to
what
they
tell
you,
“you
got
the
follow
me
home
before
you
can
sue
me.”
i
say
to
your
honors
that
that's
the
law
of
sanctuary.
it
has
no
place
in
our
present
setup
of
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
mr.
quentin
keith
one
is
section
24.
it
gets
on
the
right
pursuant
basis
if
it
is
94
that
they
weren't.
mr.
quentin
keith
now,
i
say
to
your
honors
that
a
corporation
has
long
since
been
decided
by
this
court
that
the
--
it's
inherent
and
the
--
in
the
creation
of
a
corporation
that
they
have
the
right
to
sue
and
to
be
sued.
so
that
it
if
it
becomes
any
question
of
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
give
the
national
bank
something
with
the
state
banks
who
complete
whether
or
not
they
have.
mr.
quentin
keith
yes,
sir.
that
i
--
yes
sir,
i'm
very
re
--
readily
consent
to
this.
i
say
to
your
honor
this,
congress
has
not
been
blind
to
the
fact
that
national
banks
are
not
something
that
needed
protection.
they
are
not
an
in
--
industry
any
longer.
in
facts
does
the
national
banks
although
may
not
outnumber
our
state
banks
later
about
four
other
powerful
banking
institutions
in
our
area.
we
are
trying
to
say
to
your
honors
this,
before
i
get
to
the
--
i
see
we're
practically
on
the
adjournment
time,
i'm
not
going
to
get
in
too
much
state
statutes
yet
as
to
where
i
say
this
course
of
action
come
from
of
why
it
must
be
brought
there
and
ousted.
i
say
to
your
honors
is
this
that
this
national
banking
statute
were
passed
1863
and
so
on
down
through
the
several
amendments
there,
too,
was
designed
for
the
reason
of
brief
to
protect
the
infant
industry.
and
for
100
years
this
court
has
not
passed
the
point
of
direct
that
is
to
say
whether
or
not
now
they
can
be
sued
as
other
citizens
of
the
states
may
be.
mr.
quentin
keith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
upon
adjournment
yesterday
afternoon,
i
have
words
about
to
pass
to
another
phase
of
the
matter.
that
is
to
say,
i
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
this
court
can
always
determine
the
finality
of
a
state
court
judgment
and
the
determination
of
the
finality
of
a
state
court
judgment
as
a
matter
for
this
court
to
determine.
so,
our
texas
practice
will
not
control,
of
course
and
i
so
hope
can
see,
with
your
honors'
permission
i'll
now
pass
on
to
the
--
the
matters
involved
in
this
lawsuit
as
--
if
it
reaches
the
merits,
the
court
reaches
the
merits
of
the
consideration
of
this
suit
originated
with
mr.
langdeau
as
the
receiver
appointed
of
an
insolvent
insurance
company.
he
was
appointed
a
receiver
under
our
liquidation
code
or
under
our
insurance
code.
this
is
a
lawsuit
that
was
brought
under
the
provisions
of
a
particular
texas
statute
which
says
in
substance
and
it
is
quoted
in
our
brief
“that
the
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
of
the
county
in
which
delinquency
proceedings
are
pending,
under
this
act
shall
have
venue
to
hear
and
determine
all
actions
and
proceedings
et
cetera
instituted
by
the
receiver”.
that
is
followed
by
another
provision
of
the
code
which
says
a
court,
unless
the
same
clearly
appears
to
the
contrary
from
the
text,
means
that
court
in
which
the
delinquency
proceedings
are
pending.
now,
i
say
to
you,
your
honor,
that
this
is
the
type
of
a
case
that
the
supreme
court
mentioned
and
had
in
mind
when
they
brought
upon
the
decision
in
casey
against
adams.
it
was
your
--
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
quote
very
briefly
from
casey
against
adams.
that
is
the
case
mr.
johnson
alluded
to
very
briefly
yesterday.
that
is
the
only
case
by
this
court
which
squarely
presents
a
question
involved
in
this
case.
that
is
to
say
whether
or
not
this
particular
--
peculiar
federal
statute
relating
to
national
banks
must
be
observed
in
every
instance
and
that
there
are
no
exceptions.
casey
--
mr.
quentin
keith
yes,
sir.
mr.
quentin
keith
i've
--
i
had
not
alluded
to
morgan
if
--
if
your
honor
please.
i
was
speaking
--
mr.
quentin
keith
the
morgan
case,
sir,
if
i
may
allude
to
it.
the
morgan
case
held
that
the
bank
had
waived
this
right.
mr.
quentin
keith
yes,
sir.
mr.
quentin
keith
now
--
mr.
quentin
keith
correct,
sir.
mr.
quentin
keith
no,
sir
--
no,
sir.
i
concede
sir,
that
there
is
some
language
in
the
morgan
case
that
is
adverse.
but
i
say
to
your
honor
and
i
say
again
that
casey
against
adams
is
the
only
case
in
which
this
court
has
squarely
faced
and
where
it
was
not
over
to
dictum.
mr.
quentin
keith
there
is
no
question
--
there
is
no
question
about
that.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record
but
it
--
mr.
quentin
keith
i
will
still
adhere
to
that
statement,
sir.
but
if
i
come
back
and
i
repeat
sir
with
your
permission
that
casey
against
adams
is
the
only
case
in
which
this
court
has
squarely
faced
the
issue
of
section
94
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
a
mandatory
provision.
there,
if
i
may
say
so,
was
a
case
wherein
a
bank
in
new
orleans
had
timely
claimed
their
privilege
to
be
sued
in
new
orleans,
but
the
land
upon
which
the
lawsuit
was
predicated
to
clear
the
title
to
it
was
situated
in
another
phrase,
a
similar
--
a
similar
to
a
county
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
court
there
held
that
--
and
this
is
a
very
brief
quotation
that
i
want
to
present
to
the
court.
it
says
this,
“we
think
this
statute,
we
think
relates
to
transitory
action
only
and
not
to
such
actions
as
or
by
law
local
in
their
nature”.
and
that
section
5136,
that's
the
predecessor
of
the
present
section
24,
subjects
the
banks
to
suits
at
law
or
in
equity
as
fully
as
natural
persons,
and
we
see
nowhere
in
the
banking
act
any
evidence
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
exempt
banks
from
the
ordinary
rules
affecting
the
locality
of
actions
found
at
all
local
claims.
mr.
quentin
keith
yes,
sir.
the
casey
case
--
mr.
quentin
keith
the
casey
case
was,
sir,
was
in
19
--
in
1880
and
the
morgan
case
19
years
later
in
1899.
mr.
quentin
keith
the
morgan
case
--
mr.
quentin
keith
sir?
mr.
quentin
keith
i
do
not,
sir.
i
do
not
think
that
the
morgan
case
--
mr.
quentin
keith
if
they
overruled
it
sir,
they
overruled
it
sub
silentio
because
it
had
mention
it,
i
don't
know
why,
but
if
your
honor
will
study
the
morgan
case,
casey
against
adams
wasn't
mentioned
there.
and
then
certainly
19
years
before
there
was
bound
about
an
overlapping
judge
on
that
point.
i
didn't
study
the
personnel.
mr.
quentin
keith
yes,
sir
but
--
mr.
quentin
keith
yes,
they
had
few
books.
but
i
think
they
studied
them
probably
as
well
as
we
do
some
of
our
myriad
of
books.
mr.
quentin
keith
well,
i
would
think
sir
that
when
they
once
have
held
a
case
and
upheld
firmly
and
definitely
on
a
--
on
a
provision
that
was
squarely
presented
and
where
it
should
not
be
considered
over
detective
that
they
meant
to
hold
what
they
say.
and
if
it
is
overruled,
it
will
be
overruled
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
expressly
so.
now,
sir,
this
case
presents
one
wherein
a
lawsuit
could
have
been
brought
in
all
over
the
one
county
because
this
man,
its
property
itself
was
in
custodia
legis.
the
receiver
had
the
control
and
the
custody
of
the
property
itself.
he
was
invested
by
a
statutory
authority
to
bring
the
suit
in
one
county
and
one
only.
he
brought
that
suit
there.
and
he
brought
it
against
many
individuals.
let
me
say
to
your
honors
that
while
this
case
has
not
yet
been
tried,
this
case
precedes
against
the
banks
on
the
theory
of
a
conspiracy
on
so-called
year-end
transactions.
for
instance
and
i
now
call
your
honors
attention
to
page
180
and
100
and
--
wait
a
minute,
it
is
169
of
the
--
of
the
record,
as
an
illustration
on
what
we
are
called
upon
here
to
establish
upon
the
trial
of
this
court
is
on
a
transaction,
for
instance,
that
occurred
on
december
31
of
1953,
the
insurance
company
promoters
and
their
operators
being
desires
and
of
decorating
their
year-end
statement
borrowed
$400,000
from
the
republic
bank.
taking
a
security
therefore,
a
box
sealed
up
with
an
affidavit
on
it
that
it
contains
$584,000
worth
of
premium
load.
they
purported
to
buy
$400,000
worth
of
bonds
on
the
31st
of
december.
they
earmark
those
bonds
and
on
january
2,
reappropriated
those
bonds
to
their
own
accounts,
canceled
out
the
note
and
collected
some
few
dollars
in
interest
on
$88.88
interest.
now,
we
have
a
conspiracy
charge
out
of
proposition
that
they
were
bolstering,
that
the
banks
directly
participate
or
it
is
in
the
scheme
to
defraud
the
public.
now
we
have,
in
a
conspiracy
action
generally
and
touch
as
it
is
elsewhere
where
a
person
joins
a
conspiracy
already
in
existence
and/or
he
participates
in
that
conspiracy
and
where
you
get,
you
then
can
choose
your
form.
we
chose
a
form
here
because
it
was
a
statutory
choice.
we
now
have
a
situation
wherein
a
conspiracy
action
such
as
i
have
demonstrate.
that's
only
one
of
them.
there
are
many
of
them.
mr.
quentin
keith
by
that
is
to
say
the
insurance
code
which
created
this
man's
title
the
“statutory
liquidator”,
said
under
our
texas
practice
that
new
lawsuits
shall
be
--
be
brought
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
where
the
delinquency
proceedings
are
pending.
the
delinquency
proceedings
which
are
not
challenged
were
brought
in
travis
county
that
has
receipt
of
government
in
texas.
the
--
that
is
the
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
having
custody
of
the
property
of
the
defunct
insurance
company,
one
of
the
assets
which
is
this
lawsuit,
seeking
to
recoup
the
money
that
the
--
the
debtors
and
the
stockholders
and
the
--
the
unfortunate
creditors
of
this
company
were
defrauded
of.
so
we
say
to
your
honors
that
this
is
a
suit
somewhat
lacked
the
florida
case
had
in
the
okeechobee
case
wherein
--
i
grant
you
again
that
that
is
a
state
court
case.
it
is
not
binding
and
may
be
not
even
persuasive
upon
this
court.
but
the
okeechobee
case
was
a
situation
wherein
a
--
two
banks
in
florida
had
contracted
with
a
county
whereby
that
they
were
going
to
deposit
certain
securities
to
secure
county
of
funds.
one
of
the
banks
was
located
in
jacksonville
and
another
one
was
located,
i
believe,
in
lake
county.
but
in
any
event
in
two
separate
counties,
there
was
a
tripartite
arrangement
there.
the
florida
court
considered
the
statute
which
we
have
involved
here
and
said
in
substance
that
if
--
if,
and
my
i
quote
for
just
a
moment
from
that,
“the
suit
could
not
be
maintained
against
the
one
under
the
allegation
of
this
bill
of
complaint
without
the
other
being
joined
in
that
suit
under
the
florida
national
bank
of
jacksonville
may
not
be
sued
upon
its
joint
contract
in
okeechobee
county
and
the
people's
bank
of
okeechobee
county
cannot
be
sued
on
its
joint
contract
in
duval
county
then
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
which
a
complainant
may
maintain
its
suit.
we're
not
quite
in
that
position
here
because
granted
that
we
can
try
a
conspiracy
case
in
two
different
forms.
but
your
honors
well
know
that
the
difficulty
appended
upon
that.
if
you
try
one
set
of
co-conspirator
as
one
place,
it
is
the
other
fellow
that
is
guilty.
if
you
try
them
together,
it's
the
only
place
a
successful
conspiracy
suit
can
ever
be
prosecuted.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
know
i
violated
one
of
the
court's
rules
so
we're
going
to
split
the
argument.
may
i
submit
the
remainder
of
the
time
to
mr.
cureton.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
quentin
keith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
first
address
myself
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
concerning
the
burke
investment
case.
all
of
these
are
langdeau
cases
because
he
is
the
statutory
receiver.
this
is
a
langdeau
case.
but
then
358
southwestern
2d
of
page
354
at
the
very
outset
of
the
opinion,
i
quote
from
the
reporter's
series
rather
than
the
texas
reports
because
it's
not
yet
in
the
texas
reports.
the
court
says
this.
it
is
well
settled
that
exception
14
is
mandatory
where
the
privileges
of
property
claim
being
important
to
the
suit
which
call
within
its
terms
quoting
--
citing
some
cases.
they
purport
that
the
words
used
by
the
legislature
in
section
4
(f)
which
we
have
involved
here
is
quite
different.
it
does
not
provide
that
the
actions
makes
in
very
end
shall
or
must
be
brought
in
the
county
where
the
receivership
is
pending.
a
venue
to
hear
or
determine
the
proceeding
is
conferred
upon
the
courts
of
that
county.
but
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
lawmaker
is
intended
for
such
courts
to
have
exclusive
venue
of
all
suits
by
or
against
the
receiver.
now,
i
skip
a
little
bit
over
on
page
555.
he
says
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
mandatory
provisions
of
exception
14,
that's
the
land
question
and
a
permissive
term
to
section
4
(f),
which
is
ours.
since
section
16
does
not
require
that
the
former
yield
to
the
letter
in
the
case
like
the
present.
now
finally,
he
comes
to
the
conclusion
in
the
--
as
he
must,
having
held
that
one
is
mandatory
and
the
other
is
permissive,
citing
the
general
rule,
a
permissive
statute
applicable
to
actions
of
a
particular
kind
must
always
yield
to
a
mandatory
provision.
that's
a
self-evident
fact.
and
then
he
finally
concludes
that
venue
under
exception
14
is
determined
by
the
location
of
the
land
and
the
nature
of
the
relief
sought
and
it
does
not
appear
that
the
allegations
of
the
petitioner
fraudulently
made
and
so
forth
so
consequently
the
land
venue
statute
control.
now,
nowhere
in
that
--
now
that's
two
times
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
has
written
upon
the
question
of
venue
in
concerning
this
--
the
provision
of
4
(f)
that
we
have
involved
here.
the
other
one
is
our
case
that
the
case
that
we
have
here
wherein
the
court
there
said
that
it
was
unnecessary
for
the
court
in
our
case,
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
it
is
unnecessary
to
our
decision
to
determine
whether
this
particular
action
is
local
or
transitory.
well
they
answered
it
a
year
later
in
the
burke
case
in
holding
that
it
was
a
mandatory
thing
and
consequent
rules
are
transitory
and
it
did
not
control.
now,
he
says
this
and
i
still
quote
from
the
texas
court
because
it
brings
to
bear
the
question
that
is
really
before
this
court
as
a
matter
of
practice.
he
says
as
to
invoke
the
rule
and
says
to
the
point
by
the
respondents
would
in
effect
denied
a
petitioner
the
rights
to
maintain
the
suit.
as
he
says
in
the
okeechobee
case,
if
you
got
one
bank
or
if
you
got
10
banks
residing
in
different
counties,
each
of
them
are
necessary
parties,
if
they
weren't
necessary
parties,
you
would
have
to
do
your
single
individual
cause
of
action
whether
under
the
construction
sought
by
the
banks
in
this
case
be
impossible
to
enforce
since
you
would
be
in
10
different
counties.
now,
i
confess
to
this
court
the
proposition
that
national
banks
are
not
industries
anymore.
i
address
the
further
proposition
not
that
i
dispute
for
a
moment
that
the
supremacy
of
the
act
of
congress
that
will
control
it.
but
the
national
banks
should
no
longer
the
estimates
of
the
government
that
they
were
when
the
national
banking
act
was
adopted
in
the
civil
war
days.
the
national
banks
in
effect
are
simply
private
corporations
engaged
in
business
for
private
benefit
and
as
such
are
regulated
by
the
comptroller
of
currency
just
as
our
state
banks
are
regulated
by
our
banking
commission.
i
say
to
your
honor
that
there
should
not
be
any
rule
of
law
that
says
that
the
national
--
the
city
bank
of
new
york
although
it
advertises
every
time
i
read
the
magazine
about
having
branches
all
over
the
world,
can
only
be
sued
in
new
york
city
whereas
the
chase
manhattan
bank
across
the
street
can
be
sued
just
as
where
you
can
catch
it.
now,
those
two
banks
one
of
them
being
a
state
bank
and
one
of
them
a
national
bank,
i
say
to
your
honors
that
they're
in
direct
competition
that
there
is
no
particular
reason
for
it
and
that
there
has
been
shown
here
that
there
has
been
in
effect
a
repeal
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
petitioners
or
the
appellants
in
this
case
were
liable.
now,
when
congress
passed
the
act
in
1882
saying
that
the
national
banks
should
have
a
jurisdiction
for
a
suit
here
and
after
it's
brought
by
or
against
any
association
established
under
any
law
providing
for
national
banking
except
suits
between
them
and
the
united
states
or
its
officers
and
agents
shall
be
the
same
as
and
not
other
than
the
jurisdiction
for
suits
by
or
against
banks
not
organized
under
this
--
they
so-called
‘where-to-do
business'.
now,
what
they
contend
for
here
is
a
dual
standing.
they
say
that
they
want
something
more.
congress
had
said
in
plain
and
unmistakable
language
and
there
isn't
any
question
to
what
that
still
was,
that
congress
said
that
they
shall
not
be
picked
on,
they
shall
not
be
--
suffer
to
any
detriment,
they
shall
not
be
subject
to
anything
that
is
--
that
you
don't
give
to
your
own
banks
and
chartered
by
your
own
state.
congress
did
not
mean
by
that
same
token
to
make
them
particular
wards
of
the
federal
government
even
though
at
that
time
they
were
issuing
money
that
they
were
the
instrumentalities
of
the
government.
they
don't
issue
money
anymore.
the
federal
reserve
system
has
taken
over
the
national
banking
functions.
they
are
the
instrument
of
finance
of
the
country,
not
national
banks.
i
say
to
your
honors
that
there
is
here
in
this
case
a
complete
order
and
absolute
answer
to
it,
that
is
to
say,
that
this
statute
upon
which
the
banks
rely
here
has
been
effectively
repealed,
that
it
has
been
repealed
by
an
act
of
congress
and
that
the
congressional
treatment
of
banks,
the
reason
for
its
existence
is
no
longer
fair
and
that's
the
reason
that
it
was
repealed.
now,
in
this
case,
it
seems
that
this
is
a
rather
unimportant
point,
but
the
banks
are
involved
in
this
case
for
the
142
other
people.
there
are
142
defendants
in
this
lawsuit.
the
lawsuit
has
been
on
file
now
five
years
and
nothing
has
ever
happened
to
it
except
the
trial
of
its
plea
of
privilege
on
the
stipulated
facts.
there
are
(inaudible)
of
evidentiary
facts
that
must
eventually
go
to
a
jury.
the
facts
seek
to
remove
every
facet
of
this
matter
to
dallas.
that
leaves
a
140
of
them
back
in
austin
to
try
the
rest
of
the
case.
now
the
banks
don't
come
before
this
court
under
the
record
here
as
anything
other
than
relying
upon
the
cold,
bare
rule
that
they're
in
business
as
national
banks
and
they're
entitled
to
be
sued
only
in
the
county
of
dallas,
that
that's
the
only
place
that
you
can
get
them.
now
the
lawsuit
is
in
austin
as
to
140
people.
now,
there
are
allegations
there
that
ben
jack
cage
who
has
answered
and
incidentally
ben
jack
cage
was
given
10-year
penitentiary
sentence
for
his
participation
in
this
matter
and
job
fail
and
he
is
in
brazil
according
to
time
magazine.
his
case
is
reported
and
it's
cited
in
our
briefs.
there
are
allegations
in
here
that
ben
jack
cage
for
instance,
it's
found
on
page
168
of
the
record,
went
into
the
republic
bank
one
day,
the
31st
day
of
december
of
1954
and
it
brought
with
him
a
sealed
box
upon
which
was
an
affidavit
that
there
were
$584,000
worth
of
premium
notes
in
that
sealed
box.
there
--
whereupon
the
bank
loaned
him
$400,000
on
the
last
date
of
december
of
1952
on
a
note
due
january
2,
1954,
my
first
year
was
wrong.
it
was
1953
--
it
was
the
end
of
the
year.
it
was
due
and
payable
january
2.
they
said
that
the
box
and
treasury
bills
are
$400,000,
for
those
--
and
of
course,
they
kept
the
treasury
bills.
in
january
2,
they
sold
the
treasury
bills.
they
paid
off
the
note
and
they
gave
them
back
the
unopened
box
containing
allegedly
$584,000
worth
of
premium
notes.
in
the
meanwhile,
when
it
comes
time
to
make
their
appearance
before
the
banking
--
before
the
insurance
commissioner,
as
to
how
were
you
doing
business
on
the
31st
of
december?
we
have
$400,000
worth
of
treasury
bills
but
there's
nobody
who
had
any
money.
we
have
$184,000
worth
of
premium
notes
and
they
were
in
that
box
in
the
bank.
now,
that's
only
one
of
them.
there
are
many,
many
such
instances
here.
now,
your
honors
can
see
--
your
honors
can
see
the
problem
upon
which
the
receiver
representing
the
defrauded
stockholders
and
the
people
holding
judgments
against
the
ict,
wanting
all
these
people
in
the
one
courtroom
at
one
time.
let's
just
decide
who's
going
to
pay
for
this
matter.
if
it's
true,
i
say
to
your
honors
that
they
all
ought
to
be
there
at
one
place.
a
conspiracy
case
when
you
try
it
to
one
place
a
part
of
it,
it's
all
laid
up
on
the
other
fellow.
but
you
got
them
in
their
together
and
let
one
jury
decide
where
and
who's
responsible
for
it.
i
say
to
your
honors
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
statute
has
been
repealed
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
start
--
the
reason
for
the
statute
no
longer
exist,
and
as
a
matter
of
reason
--
as
a
matter
of
reason
this
court
should
not
create
anymore
‘no
man's
land'
where
you
can't
sue
anybody
for
the
rights
of
(inaudible).
and
in
appearing
here
today,
we
appear
here
not
in
the
nature
of
--
as
you
would
normally
do,
to
litigate,
but
for
a
receiver
seeking
to
collect
money
from
perpetrators
of
fraudulent
transactions
so
that
we
could
pay
off
judgment
that
were
recovered
by
the
widows
and
the
orphans
in
texas
and
to
pay
them
the
money
that
we
believe
rightfully
belongs
to
them,
but
to
say
that
because
there's
an
old
statute
of
dubious
ancestry
and
history,
it's
going
to
say
we
must
segregate
this
lawsuit
and
try
it
in
two
places,
is
in
effect
to
deny
the
receiver
the
right
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
any
lawsuit,
anywhere
or
anytime.
mr.
quentin
keith
if
there
was
not
a
receivership
--
if
there
was
not
a
receivership
pending
and
if
there
were
no
limitation
questions
involved,
then
i
would
say
to
your
honor
that
there
is
a
possibility
if
both
of
the
banks
live
in
the
same
county,
as
they
do
here,
because
that
might
be
able
to
allege
under
peculiar
venue
statute
we
have
in
texas,
a
cause
of
action
that
in
the
--
mr.
quentin
keith
sir?
we
have
no
--
texas
statute
is
not
mandatory.
mr.
quentin
keith
yes,
i
could
sue
these
two
banks
in
one
place
and
i
could
--
mr.
quentin
keith
i
could
sue
the
individuals
even
though
they
live
in
dallas
or
maybe
they
live
houston,
or
amarillo
or
el
paso
or
somewhere.
i
would
be
force
to
allege
and
to
prove
or
make
a
showing
on
the
preliminary
hearing,
(a)
that
they
were
necessary
parties
to
the
lawsuit,
that
they
were
parties
to
the
conspiracy.
what
we
term
unnecessary
parties
then
that
defeats
their
right
to
be
sued
in
their
own
county.
mr.
quentin
keith
that
is
--
not
in
this
case.
i
mean
time
has
already
wiped
out
any
possibility.
i'm
talking
specifically
and
i
address
my
part
--
mr.
quentin
keith
well,
limitation
is
already
long
since
about
this
--
mr.
quentin
keith
--
lawsuit
because
--
mr.
quentin
keith
--
filed
--
mr.
quentin
keith
conceivably
so,
had
we
anticipated
that
this
court
was
going
to
hold
differently
than
what
our
texas
supreme
court
did
that
is
with
reference
to
the
banking
act.
i
say
to
your
honors
that
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you
that
there
is
a
possibility
and
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
possibility.
assuming
this
court
held
against
us
that
there
would
be
a
method
and
a
manner
whereby
a
future
suits
such
as
this
conceivably
could
be
brought
in
the
county
which
the
banks
were
located
for
filing
--
all
of
your
banks
were
located
in
one
county.
mr.
quentin
keith
or
doing
business,
sir,
yes.
mr.
quentin
keith
yes
it
does,
it
kind
of
zealously
blights
delineation
or
somewhat.
it
doesn't
offer
the
fact
in
this
particular
case
and
i
was
addressing
myself
with
this
particular
case.
i
didn't
mean
to
mislead
the
court
in
the
sense
that
we're
not
--
i'm
talking
about
a
model
suit,
but
some
possible
lawsuit
in
the
future.
mr.
quentin
keith
i
--
mr.
quentin
keith
i
raise
the
question,
if
the
court
please,
that
we
are
necessary
parties.
now,
there
is
a
distinction
in
our
practice
between
necessary
parties
and
nominal
parties
or
parties
at
convenience
and
so
on.
mr.
quentin
keith
or
indispensable
parties,
but
now
in
this
instance,
i
say
to
your
honors
that
ben
jack
cage,
the
perpetrator
for
fraud
is
a
necessary
party
to
it.
in
other
words,
he
went
down
and
he
signed
ict
insurance
company
by
ben
jack
cage
to
the
republic
bank
and
that
this
was
an
estimate
of
fraud
that
ben
jack
cage
or
republic
bank
ought
to
be
in
the
same
court
house
at
the
same
time,
he
tried
the
lawsuit.
whereas
if
you've
got
two
banks,
one
of
them
just
30
miles
away
of
fort
worth
for
instance,
in
tarrant
county
and
one
of
them
in
dallas
and
he
could
have
done
it
in
two
hours
this
apart,
then
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
the
entire
matter
together.
mr.
quentin
keith
no,
he
answered
you
--
mr.
quentin
keith
no,
i
think
he
answered
you
this
way,
that
they
were
--
that
can
you
have
a
distinction
with
the
necessary
parties.
and
that's
under
our
general
venue
statute.
now,
so
long
as
you
can
get
all
of
your
people
with
your
banks,
all
in
one
place,
then
--
because
if
your
honors
hold
that
this
particular
national
statute
is
mandatory
then
there
is
no
way
under
our
texas
practice
that
i
can
get
two
national
banks
who
happen
to
live
in
different
counties.
we
have
no
branch
banking
so
it's
not
a
question
of
doing
business
anywhere
else.
we
have
no
national
--
no
branch
banking
by
constitution
in
texas.
mr.
quentin
keith
that
--
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
quentin
keith
not
quite
that
--
that
you
could
ever
get
them
together
if
they
were
national
banks
whereas
if
there
were
state
banks,
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
and
i'm
trying
to
make
to
your
honor.
if
they
were
state
banks,
you
could
get
them
together
at
least
in
one
time.
mr.
quentin
keith
no
sir,
in
any
case
--
mr.
quentin
keith
because
the
states
--
the
state
rights
or
the
state
bank
rights
are
controlled
by
state
law.
and
now
what
the
national
banks
here
seek
is
something
that
the
state
banks
can't
ever
--
so
long
as
the
bank
is
chartered
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas,
it
could
never
claim
the
benefits
of
section
9
accordance
that
you
have
before
you
--
mr.
quentin
keith
sir?
mr.
quentin
keith
say
it's
just
like
any
other
citizen.
i
mean
you
would
normally
sue
them
and
they
have
the
right
to
be
sued
in
the
county
in
which
they
are
domicile.
mr.
quentin
keith
with
exceptions
to
tort
actions,
for
instance
that
you
can
bring
in
the
county
in
which
the
tort
occurred
--
mr.
quentin
keith
where
i
could
catch
a
local
defendant
in
the
department.
mr.
quentin
keith
let
me
--
let
me
take
the
illustration
of
dallas
and
fort
worth
of
30
miles
apart.
i've
got
two
state
banks,
one
in
dallas
and
one
in
fort
worth
and
i've
got
a
local
defendant
living
in
austin.
ben
jack
cage
lived
in
austin.
i
could
take
my
choice.
i
could
take
my
choice
and
i
can
take
austin,
fort
worth
or
dallas.
mr.
quentin
keith
anyone
of
the
three.
mr.
quentin
keith
right.
any
--
one
court
by
the
three
--
by
some
token,
they
entered
into
this
conspiracy
in
houston.
i
could
sue
all
three
of
them
there
even
though
none
of
them
lived
in
there
because
that's
important
--
for
the
cause
of
action
to
approve.
did
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
quentin
keith
thank
you,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
quentin
keith
there
is
only
peculiar
provision
under
our
workman's
compensation
act
that
provides
that
--
subsequently
develops
a
strong
case
to
moot.
otherwise,
we
you
don't
claim
it
and
it
doesn't
involve
land
(inaudible)
where
it
was
filed.
mr.
quentin
keith
yes,
sir.
thank
you,
sir.
