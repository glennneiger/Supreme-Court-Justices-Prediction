justice
byron
r.
white
before
you
leave
the
jurisdictional
point
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
did
you
think
that
pope
against
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
was
a
relevant
case
on
that
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see
you
don't
cite
it
in
here
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
this
isn't
a
land
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
court,
and
your
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
court
held
it
wasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
there
was
not
a
receiver
--
receivership
involved
here,
you
would
have
--
this
problem
was
no
way
to
solve
whatsoever.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
your
texas
statute
is
mandatory?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
could
have
use
--
under
the
texas
law,
you
could
sue
these
two
banks
in
one
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
couldn't
sue
the
individual.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
there
is
--
i
mean
this
is
where
you
get
all
your
problems,
i
take
it.
you
say
that
the
statute
shouldn't
be
--
shouldn't
be
construed
so
that
you
don't
have
the
remedy
against
necessary
party.
well,
you
do
have
a
remedy
against
necessary
parties
in
a
conspiracy
act
under
your
own
texas
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
because
of
statute
limitations?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
if
you'd
start
it
out,
that
could
mean
instead
of
trying
to
sue
in
the
receivership
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
doing
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
wasn't
--
in
that
event,
it
wouldn't
be
the
construction
of
the
statute
that
is
--
so
it
would
be
troublesome,
it
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
fact
it
started
out
without
--
maybe
starting
two
lawsuits
in
two
different
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
indispensable
parties.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
would
be
the
--
this
would
be
the
case
if
there
wasn't
a
receivership
pending
and
the
banks
were
in
two
different
counties.
this
would
be
the
normal
situation
that
you
run
into
in
many
ordinary
cases
around
the
country
that
sometimes
you
can't
get
two
defendants
together
when
you
want
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
lawyer
runs
into
everyday,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
is
a
receivership
pending?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that.
but
assume
--
what
is
the
venue
for
a
state
bank
where
no
receivership
is
pending
or
anything,
you
just
want
to
sue
a
state
bank,
where
do
you
sue
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
want
to
sue
them
for
a
conspiracy?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
let's
assume
that
you
want
to
sue
two
banks
who
do
business
in
two
different
counties,
two
state
banks
in
two
different
counties
on
a
conspiracy.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
could
sue
them
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
anyone
of
the
defendants
resided.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it
did.
