justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
--
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
unless
you
referred
to
it
and
i
didn't
hear
it,
do
you
agree
with
the
lineup
of
ca
--
state
cases
in
the
appellee's
brief?
is
it
true
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
federal
state
court
has
gone
one
way,
has
gone
against
you
on
these
two
cases,
two
state
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
have
you
marshaled
the
state
decisions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
--
where's
the
appendix
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
got
20
and
years
12,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
a
morgan
case
in
--
before
this
court?
that
--
it's
urging
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
that
--
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
contested
or
--
or
canvas
but
has
there
any
been
reference
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
that
mean
that
they
left
open?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where's
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where's
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
citation,
the
volume?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
one
right
now.
oh,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
keith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you'll
have
to
enlighten
me
a
little
bit.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
as
of
this
moment,
this
is
a
non-relitigable
issue
in
texas
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
this
court
should,
according
to
its
own
standard
of
finality
for
purposes
of
taking
jurisdiction
over
a
state
judgment
suppose
it
has
not
--
does
not
have
the
quality
of
finality
for
our
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
then
the
question
could
be
litigated
in
the
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
tell
me
that
--
that
howsoever
that
go,
howsoever
that
go,
if
it
goes
to
the
merit
that
on
review,
the
texas
supreme
court
or
whatever
the
court
is
that
has
a
final
to
say
could
not
review
the
question
of
venue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
--
then
how
do
you
open
it?
because
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
says
for
our
purposes,
it
is
not
final.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
--
your
answer
--
on
your
answer
may
turn
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
it's
final
for
our
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
you
don't
--
if
i
may
interrupt,
suppose
no
reviews
--
suppose
exception
is
taken
that
the
seizure
of
jurisdiction
by
the
local
texas
court,
suppose
the
present
appellant
having
made
that
warrant
that
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction,
it's
ruled
against
them
and
they
duly
may
take
an
exception
whatever
you
call
it
in
texas
and
say
we'll
reserve
the
review
of
that
until
--
until
the
disposition
of
the
merits
because
they
waived
them
then
they
couldn't
raise
it
there
after?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
which
to
--
in
to
which
to
seek
a
reviewing
that
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
which
--
then
that
is
if
he
doesn't
desire.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
telling
me
--
are
you
telling
me
that
the
trial
section
law
is
concerned,
that's
final
but
if
this
court,
says
it
isn't
final
for
purposes
of
review
for
--
under
the
original
--
original
article
section
25
of
the
judiciary
act
that
then
texas
might
set
a
different
review?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
understand
but
--
but
the
prior
--
texas
case
would
come
up
here
from
final
determination
of
your
appellate
court
and
says
we're
--
you
don't
look
at.
applying
statute
as
to
the
venue
disposition
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
wants
to
deal
with
it,
that
it's
through.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
concession
of
the
congress
to
allow
suit
at
all
in
the
state
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
mr.
keith
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
fully
understand
what
was
decided
in
morgan
but
i
do
not
quite
see
why
you
say
it
wasn't
presented
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
just
said,
the
only
--
you
just
said
that
casey
was
the
only
case
in
which
that
issue
would
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
fully
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
before
they
got
to
waive,
they
considered
--
the
court
considered
quite
extensively,
what
it
is
that
required
waiver
or
what
--
what
is
--
what's
involved
in
the
waiver.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
fully
understand
that
you
can
say
technically
that
was
a
--
that
was
a
dictum.
and
if
the
court
had
written
an
opinion
in
which
it
said
in
fact,
whatever
may
be
the
requirement
of
the
statute
in
this
case,
you're
not
called
upon
to
decide
it
because
even
if
it
was
waived,
but
there
was
no
even
if
talking
in
the
morgan
opinion,
was
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
--
i
followed
you
yesterday.
i
thought
your
argument
yesterday
was,
and
i
don't
see
why
you
shouldn't
have
a
greater
wisdom
overnight.
but
your
argument
--
your
argument
yesterday
was
that
the
impact
of
national
banks
or
the
role
of
national
banks
in
the
economy
in
--
in
the
banking
scheme
of
the
country
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
considerably
changed
since
the
morgan
case
in
that
knowledge,
whatever
may
numerical
number
of
national
banks
in
texas,
their
power
unrelated
to
the
unit
of
banks,
their
power
is
far
greater
than
the
larger
number
of
state
banks,
that's
what
your
oral
argument
yesterday,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understood
to
say
that
you
wanted
us
in
effect
understanding
these
words.
you
properly,
to
my
point
of
view,
you
said
that
what
was
said
in
morgan
should
be
reconsidered
because
the
underlying
circumstances
were
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
remember
and
you
will
tell
me,
the
casey
case
was
earlier
than
the
morgan
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
morgan
case
eat
what
you
just
quoted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
that
the
morgan
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
go
back
on
what
--
what
you'd
find
in
casey?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
morgan
case
go
back
on
what
you'd
find
in
casey?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
to
me
very
strange
that
the
morgan
case
discussing,
not
saying
we're
not
qualified
to
discuss
these
things
for
there
was
waiver
thus,
discuss
it
on
the
merits
quite
--
quite
unreservedly
that
the
later
case
after
a
full
discussion
should
have
overruled
in
effect
what
you
say
was
the
prior
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
just
--
no
justices
had
few
books
to
turn
to
when
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
cases
that
we
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
that's
really
insignificant
that
they
didn't
mention
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
repeating
that?
i
don't
think
i
get
the
force
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
by
federal
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
have
you
got
the
reference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
those
were
independent
provisions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
in
your
briefs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
91
you're
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
did
you
say
of
your
brief?
you
said
90
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
is
that
in
construed
to
the
(voice
overlap)
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
said
is
that
a
suit
against
the
national
bank
can
only
be
brought
in
the
county
in
which
a
state
and
all
the
state
banks
could
be
sued.is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
as
to
the
venue
of
the
county.
otherwise,
this
act
would
have
repealed
the
earlier
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
are
right,
that's
an
easy
answer
to
this
whole
case
then,
all
the
case
that
i've
been
talking
--
i've
been
talking
irrelevances.
what
you're
now
saying
is,
in
order
to
determine
where
a
federal
--
where
a
national
bank
may
be
sued,
you
go
to
the
state
--
to
the
state
venue
provision
pursuing
a
state
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that's
so,
there's
no
problem.
you've
just
turned
94
around
instead
of
saying
that
the
statute
in
94
defined
by
congress
where
a
suit
may
be
brought
against
the
--
against
the
national
bank
even
if
brought
in
the
state
court.
do
not
make
federal
jurisdiction
pendent
on
state
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you'll
appeal
at
the
other
side
because
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
you
are
saying.
and
if
i
follow
you,
what
you
are
saying
is,
jurisdiction
against
the
--
in
a
suit
involving
a
national
bank
in
the
federal
court
is
determined
by
the
jurisdiction
against
the
state
bank
in
a
state
court.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
means
that
section
94
is
repealed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
also
saying,
if
you're
right,
that
when
this
court
discussed
section
94
in
18
--
in
the
morgan
case,
it
discussed
the
section
that
has
been
repealed
and
assumed
that
this
was
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
--
and
you
are
saying
now
that,
impliedly,
the
1882
act
repealed
94
and
therefore
in
1882
was
repealed
by
18
--
1948.
there
was
nothing
left.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
if
you
are
right,
only
if
you
are
right.
you're
assuming
that
you
are
right.
otherwise,
it
wouldn't
be
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
94
has
superiority
over
your
state
law
restriction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
assuming
that
congress
cannot
pass
a
venue
statute
that
should
control
and
put
to
one
side
a
restrictive
state
venue
statute
relating
to
federal
national
bank.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
whole
--
i'd
like
to
be
clarified
about
this.
the
whole
power
to
sue
a
national
bank
in
a
state
court
is
federally
granted.
the
congress
may
take
it
all
away
and
restrict
for
the
whole
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
so,
i'm
sorry
to
say.
national
banks
from
the
beginning,
i
happen
to
be
familiar
with
the
history
of
what
you
are
now
reading,
national
banks
from
the
constitutional
power
to
create
them,
rested
on
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
create
federal
agents,
national
banks
of
federal
agencies
and
therefore
it's
within
the
power
of
congress
to
restrict
suit,
the
court
through
which
suits
may
be
brought
against
federal
agencies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
would
be
for
a
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
reason
because
of
the
whole
conception
of
corporations
in
those
areas
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
incorporated
would
deem
to
thee
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
individual
citizens
of
the
place
where
the
thing
was
incorporated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
should
there
be
doubt
about
state
court,
if
you
are
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
said
that
if
there
was
doubt
about
a
state
court,
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
why
there
should
be
doubt
about
state
courts.
you're
accounted
for
their
references
to
state
courts
that
were
doubts.
what
doubt
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
(inaudible)
case
in
309
u.s.
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
whole
concept,
the
whole
climate
of
opinion,
the
whole
way
of
looking
at
things
about
corporation
in
the
days
of
the
deveaux
case
were
wholly
different
from
our
conception
regarding
a
corporation
as
a
legal
personnel,
and
that's
at
the
bottom
of
the
deveaux
case,
not
the
relation
between
state
and
federal
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
conceive
of
a
corporation
as
being
a
legal
person
suing
and
suable,
they
thought
a
corporation
with
a
collection,
was
a
company
of
adventurer
as
they
call
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
time
they
got
around
to
--
by
the
time
they
got
around
to
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
casey
case
and
the
morgan
case,
that
motion
of
a
corporation
have
long
since
gone
by
way
of
the
bank
of
augusta
against
earle
and
all
the
other
decisions
when
chief
justice
stone
is
gone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
basically
in
adams
as
justice
stewart
indicated,
casey
and
adams
for
the
construction
of
section
94
in
a
case
relating
to
real
estate.
and
chief
justice
in
writing
the
opinion
said
local
actions
which
are
in
the
nature
which
concern
the
things
which
are
in
the
nature
of
suits.
and
therefore,
he
construed
the
statute
to
mean
that
if
you
go
after
the
thing,
you
have
to
go
after
it
where
it
is.
isn't
that
right?
isn't
that
what
the
chief
justice
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
can't
be
whether
the
state
by
calling
all
actions
local
can
derail
the
federal
act.
that's
too
easy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
lawyers
constantly
construe
language
in
its
settings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
chief
justice
--
waived
it
perfectly,
if
i
may
say
so
without
disrespect,
lawyer-like
things
and
say
you
construe
this
in
the
light
of
circumstances
that
went
vividly
in
the
minds
of
the
congress.
and
when
you're
confronted
with
that
kind
of
a
problem,
you
put
yourself
in
the
place
of
the
congress.
and
it
couldn't
be
that
he
in
effect,
these
aren't
his
words,
i'll
come
to
the
exact
words
in
a
minute,
but
couldn't
be
that
they
meant
suit
must
be
brought
and
get
hold
of
the
thing
where
there
is
no
thing.
and
therefore
he
said
it
doesn't
apply
to
interim
proceedings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
find
no
such
statute
as
you
find.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
do
indicate
what
your
argument
leads
to
is
if
you
fail
on
a
ca
--
in
casey's
case
is
that
a
state
by
statutory
definitions
would
make
every
action
local
and
therefore
practically
puts
to
sleep
section
94.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
i
--
i
had
that
in
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
transferred.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
the
reason
that
you
are
after
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
reason
that
you're
--
you
are
after
here?
did
you
ask
for
any
attachment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
statute
makes
it
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
local
law
makes
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
means
that
this
--
that
the
local
law
of
any
state
can
make
anything
of
transitory
action,
anything
non-transitory
action
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
isn't
a
question
of
wrong
or
right,
this
is
a
question
of
what
limit
--
what
congress
has
done
if
it
has
done
anything
as
to
where
suits
maybe
brought
against
national
bank.
it
closely
confined
a
question
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
more
for
environment
when
it
comes
to
matters
of
policies
and
when
it
comes
to
questions
of
venue,
environment
is
a
very
different
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
address
yourself
to
the
argument
we
just
heard
before
you
got
on
your
feet,
the
act
of
1882,
the
provider
of
1882
by
virtue
of
its
last
clause
repealing
all
of
the
inconsistent
prior
legislation
in
effect
repealed
94
and
that
was
subsequent
repeal
in
1948
of
the
1882
act,
couldn't
bring
to
life
that
theretofore
repealed
section
94.
i
think
that's
the
correct
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
whole
subject
is
technical.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
job
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
convince
us
that
we
shouldn't
follow
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
--
can
you
tell
me
when
section
--
when
was
section
94
originally
enacted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
now
--
in
revisions
--
there
were
revisions
of
--
of
the
statutes
at
large,
from
time
to
time,
there
was
a
revised
statue
of
course
in
77
and
78
and
there's
a
judicial
code
in
1911.
in
any
of
those
subsequent
revisions
of
judiciary
matters,
was
this
section
94
included?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
be
important
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
if
it
was
brought
forward
after
1882
for
enactment
of
congress,
it's
hardly
a
plausible
argument
that
it
was
repealed
in
1882,
though
i
think
those
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
a
--
in
an
act
relating
to
national
banks
or
in
the
judicial
code?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
in
1926,
the
revision
of
the
national
bank
act
included
in
effect
section
94
and
it's
what
--
and
carried
down
to
1926.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
couldn't
very
well
of
--
or
if
it
was
repealed
in
1882,
it
was
revised
in
1926.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
give
me
--
what's
the
title
of
the
--
you
know
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
congress
passed
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
passed
it,
didn't
it?
it
was
an
act
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
of
--
it
wasn't
a
private
venture
or
a
--
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
there
was
--
there
was
an
emission,
a
legislative
emission
in
1926
by
congress
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
we
could
simply
turn
the
pages
of
this
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
find
out.
