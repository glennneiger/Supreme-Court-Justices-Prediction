justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
may
i
ask
you
not
to
mention
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
your
act
is
not
like
the
new
york
statute
even
apart
from
those
amendments,
is
it?
you
say
--
your
statute
says
that
even
though
discharged
in
bankruptcy,
the
debt
must
still
be
paid
in
full
and
one
cannot
have
the
license
until
it
is
paid
in
full,
whereas
the
new
york
statute
put
a
limitation
of
three
years
on
it,
didn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
wouldn't
it
be
permissible
in
either
case
for
the
state
in
the
exercise
of
its
--
(voice
overlap)
--
you
shall
be
--
it
can
have
a
certain
accident,
be
prohibited
from
driving
for
a
classified
reasonable
appearance.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
isn't
that
the
difference
between
the
reitz
case,
the
new
york
statute
than
your
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
theory
of
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
theory
of
that
is
that
the
state
is
interested
in
people
carrying
certain
minimum
amounts
of
protection,
isn't
that
it,
$10,000
in
any
one
accident?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
what
your
--
the
theory
of
that
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
madsen,
just
a
minor
question.
does
the
uniform
act
and
the
act
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
makes
suspension
permanent
until
judgment
is
paid
or
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
is
it
for
period?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
just
the
point.
one
criterion
makes
payment
of
a
discharged
debt,
the
criterion
and
the
other
makes
the
police
power,
namely
some
sanction
for
a
negligent
conduct,
the
criterion.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no
sanctions
then,
effective
sanctions
are
levied
against
one
who
has
means
to
discharge
any
judgment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that
still
makes
payment
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
(voice
overlap)
criterion.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
would
seem
to
me
new
york
statute
took
care
of
the
matter.
it
says
that
you
may
not
have
your
license
back
for
three
years
unless
--
meanwhile
you
pay.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
you
get
your
license
back
in
new
york.
now,
it
seems
to
me
it's
one
thing
and
surely
a
state
can
say
that
one
found
guilty
of
negligently
injuring
another
with
an
automobile
shall
suffer
a
certain
sanction
such
as
the
temporary,
at
least,
surrender
of
his
license
to
drive.
but
to
say
that
one
can
never
drive
until
he
has
paid
the
debt
that
has
been
discharged
in
bankruptcy
is
to
revive
the
debt
and
thus
to
negate
the
bankruptcy
act.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
this
is
just
something
i
wrote
down
myself
to
ask
you
about.
now,
what
about
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
new
york
in
that
situation
under
its
statute
would
say,
you
can't
have
one
free
accident,
you
must
either
suffer
a
penalty
of
three
years
or
sooner
pay.
isn't
that
what
new
york
says?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
that
would
be
true,
is
it
not,
where
--
i
mean
--
let's
put
that
this
way,
it
would
be
true
that
for
all
of
the
dues,
the
$15,000
over
the
$10,000,
there
would
be
no
execution
to
it
because
the
debtor
didn't
discharge
the
bankruptcy
or
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
you're
forcing
payment
of
the
first
$10,000
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
of
the
$25,000
bankruptcy
discharged
judgment.
