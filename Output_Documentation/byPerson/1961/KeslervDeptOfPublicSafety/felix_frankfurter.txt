justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
bar
this
court
from
considering
whether
there
isn't
relief
for
him
under
the
state
law
which
he
has
not
exhausted?
the
fact
that
the
three-judge
court,
that
the
litigation
didn't
take
that
element
into
account
to
which
the
chief
justice
has
referred,
does
that
bar
this
court
from
considering
whether
in
fact
we
have
what
might
be
called
an
abstract
question
here?
in
other
words,
the
implication
as
i
get
it
of
the
chief
justice's
question
is
that
if
he
could
get
his
license
restored
under
state
law
by
an
appropriate
application
from
the
state
agency
and
he
didn't
resort
to
that,
then
haven't
we
got
a
situation
in
which
the
constitutional
question
is
what
might
be
called
premature?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
--
neither
your
state
agency,
your
supreme
court
held
that
the
debt
was
not
discharged.
in
other
words,
if
he
was
sued
for
this
judgment,
debt,
for
discharging
bankruptcy
i'd
take
it
would
be
controlling,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
--
what
your
state
agency
did
as
approved
by
your
supreme
court
is
not
to
say
that
the
debt
isn't
discharged,
didn't
say
that.
they
said
that
in
effect,
what
was
said
in
reitz
namely
that
the
state
has
another
interest
which
isn't
included
in
what
--
in
--
which
isn't
a
consequence
of
a
discharged
debt.
the
debt
may
be
discharged
and
get
some
--
something
--
some
--
the
state
may
draw
some
conclusion
from
the
fact
that
the
fellow
didn't
pay
his
debt
although
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
it
because
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to,
apart
from
the
difference
that
justice
whittaker
just
called
attention,
what
do
you
say
to
the
consideration
given
by
judge
hand
in
writing
in
reitz
against
mealey
for
the
three
district
court
--
for
the
district
court,
what
do
you
say
to
the
considerations
of
judge
hand
that
this
business
of
spelling
out
in
the
statute
that
the
creditor
should
ask
a
clerk
to
forward
the
judgment.
it's
all
eyewash
because
that
happens
anyhow,
that
the
clerk
wouldn't
know
whether
debt
was
paid,
that
he
would
be
nudged
even
though
the
statute
said
nothing
about
it,
he
would
be
nudged
by
the
creditor
who
has
chief
interest
so
far
as
that
goes
in
telling
the
unsatisfied
judgment
debt
forwarded
to
the
agency
and
that
the
clerk
couldn't
possibly
know
whether
the
judgment
debt
has
been
discharged
without
--
without
calling
upon
the
judgment
creditor
for
all
this
information
so
that
spelling
out
in
the
statute,
the
creditor
must
ask
the
clerk,
he's
merely
spelling
out
what
in
fact
takes
place
in
life.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
statute
doesn't
give
--
doesn't
give
him
that
control
and
if
he
fulfills
the
condition
to
which
the
chief
justice
has
referred.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
drivers
who
bring
about
sometimes
gas
or
certainly
loss
of
injury
to
one
sort
or
another,
dangerous
ones
at
times,
such
drivers
of
greater
hazard,
if
they
don't
have
to
pay
any
consequence
for
their
negligence
to
disregard
the
rules
of
the
road,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
deciding
who
shall
have
a
license.
and
therefore,
this
isn't
just
the
state
capriciously,
without
any
interest,
saying,
“oh
no,
while
the
fellow
is
discharged,
we're
going
to
use
the
club
against
him.”
it's
like
the
case
--
the
instance
that
judge
hand
gives.
suppose
--
suppose
the
state
refuses
to
hire
a
man
in
a
--
or
discharges
a
man
--
as
a
fireman
refuses
to
hire
him
is
solely
because
he
didn't
pay
up
a
discharge,
a
discharge?
so
the
debt
is
discharged.
nobody
can
make
the
fellow
pay,
but
the
city
says,
a
fellow
who
lives
beyond
his
means
which
is
what
not
paying
your
debt
means,
is
not
a
good
risk
for
us
as
a
firefighter
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
a
certain
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
have
to
go
very
far,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
--
did
this
originate
with
the
uniform
commissioners?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
a
--
i'm
one
of
these
unique
creatures
that
doesn't
drive
a
car
but
aren't
there
other
sanctions
for
denying
a
license
and
revoking
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
we
say
there
were
no
other
sanctions
against
the
fellow
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
madsen.
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
reitz,
meaning
right
of
the
statute,
1936
act
of
new
york
could,
to
use
the
phrase
of
my
brother,
could
the
state
commissioner
have
triggered
the
proceedings
unless
the
clerk
sent
up
a
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
i
don't
think
i
put
my
question.
could,
under
the
new
york
law
of
1936,
the
--
whatever
the
appropriate
agency
was,
the
commission
have
sua
sponte
of
its
own
accord
revoke
the
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
did
the
--
the
nonpayment
of
the
judgment
debt
get
deployed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
haven't
taken
my
question
as
i
may
state
here.
i
asked,
could
the
commission,
without
any
notice
from
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
i
ask
you
mr.
madsen
over
this
law
as
a
product
of
the
uniform
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
know,
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
it
--
would
you
agree
the
case
gets
down
to
this
that
this
court
has
to
decide
whether
the
exercise
by
congress
of
the
bankruptcy
power
whereby
honest
debtors
are
discharged
for
inability
to
pay
their
debt
preempts
or
does
not
preempt
an
interest
that
the
state
may
have
in
its
own
like
which
by
indirection
may
also
involve
putting
some
pressure
on
the
discharged
debtor.
isn't
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
no
--
there's
no
minimum
finding
in
the
court,
i
mean
the
court
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
man
has
four
children
or
three
children
or
about
to
go
to
college,
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera.
he
just
pays
$10
a
month
for
the
next
three
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
judgment
is
wiped
out,
i
mean,
the
judgment
doesn't
exist
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
madsen,
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question,
namely
that
he
have
to
pay
it
all
which
was
discharged
on
the
account
of
your
analysis
of
your
state
statute
a
court
may
relieve
him
from
paying
all
and
thinking
that
a
partial
payment
over
an
extended
period
of
time
would
satisfy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
the
payment
of
the
judgment
which
isn't
what
the
court
is
concerned
with
but
to
determine
whether
he
is
a
reliable
fellow
who
should
have
a
vehicle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
up
to
the
statutory
requirement,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
--
for
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
automobile
liability
security
that
this
act
apparently
is
one
of
the
act
that
the
commissioner's
model
act,
i
think,
undoubtedly
from
the
latest
report
of
the
uniform
commission,
i
gather
that
this
was
one
of
their
proposals,
this
act
emanated
from
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
judgment
is
$20,000
or
$15,000
or
$30,000,
it
may
be
cut
down
to
$10,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
minimum
requirement
but
not
--
but
not
a
requirement
to
liquidate
the
judgment
debt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
standard
statements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
[inaudible]
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
--
your
--
the
specific
provision
of
your
separability
clause
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
years
now
--
for
years
and
years,
well,
that
since
1940
the
separability
clause
affecting
federal
statute
does
precisely
that
that
if
any
part
of
this
or
any
provision,
any
clause
so
that
you
can
cut
out
the
words.
