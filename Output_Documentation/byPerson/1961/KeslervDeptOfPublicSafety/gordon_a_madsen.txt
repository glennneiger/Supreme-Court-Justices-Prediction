mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
fell
out
in
the
basic
reason
for
the
statute.
i
would
like
to
submit
that
there
are
two
other
bases
however
in
addition.
first
that
the
state,
and
we
indicate
in
our
brief
at
the
outset,
perhaps
i
should
say
by
way
of
introduction
first,
we
conceded
that
this
court
--
or
the
three-judge
court
had
jurisdiction
in
the
matter
and
of
course
this
court
as
well
and
i
should
like
also
to
mention
two
additional
facts
that
were
not
touched
upon
by
counsel
for
the
appellant.
in
this
instance,
this
particular
bankrupt,
discharged,
in
addition
to
this
particular
judgment,
a
$502
small
loan
and
a
$290
attorney's
fee,
the
attorney's
fee
resulting
from
the
trial
of
his
negligent
action.
so
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
bankrupt
was
principally
discharging
this
particular
debt
in
the
course
of
taking
out
that
bankruptcy.
and
i
also
wish
to
point
out
that
in
response
to
this
question
of
separability
and
what
the
legislature's
intent
is,
there
is
no
discussion
in
either
brief
about
the
legislative
intent
in
passing
this
act
largely
because
there
isn't
any
such
record
of
it.
there
are
no
reports
of
committee
action
that
are
printed
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
utah
except
where
there
are
some
public
hearing
and
there
was
none
in
this
instance
when
this
act
was
passed
in
1951.
the
act,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
a
copy
of
the
uniform
vehicle
code
which
has
been
widely
adopted
in
many
of
the
states
in
our
country.
i
point
out
on
page
5
in
our
brief,
in
the
footnote,
at
the
bottom,
the
21
states,
including
utah,
which
have
so
passed
this
act.
it's
also
of
interest
to
note
that
the
congress
has
passed
this
act
with
these
creditor
control
provisions
in
them
for
the
district
of
columbia.
and
assuming
the
intent
of
congress
and
knowledge
on
the
part
of
congress,
that
it
is
aware
to
the
paramountness
of
the
bankruptcy
act
when
congress
passed
this
act
for
the
district
of
columbia
it
left
this
creditor
control
in
the
act,
i
presume,
assuming
that
you
can
ascribe
some
intent
to
congress
knowing
or
believing
that
these
provisions
did
not
conflict
with
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
i
don't
know
where
these
controls
originated
your
honor.
they
must
have
come
into
being
somewhere
around
1936
or
1939
when
they
were
put
in
the
way
of
amendments
in
the
new
york
act
as
it
was
considered
in
the
reitz
case.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
and
i
think
the
reasoning
behind
that
and
this
is
only
my
opinion
but
i
believe
the
reasoning
behind
the
business
of
making
it
permanent
rather
than
for
a
limited
period
would
be
that
if
you
make
it
for
a
limited
period,
the
possibility
of
collection
is
thereby
frustrated.
if
in
fact
the
judgment
debtor
can
prolong
for
enough
time
the
collection
of
his
debt,
he
can
get
his
license
back
by
the
simple
expiration
of
time
whether
or
not
he
had
satisfied
his
debt
or
proved
financial
responsibility.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
yes.
i
believe,
however,
that
they
can't
be
separated,
mr.
justice,
in
this
particular
that
i
think
--
and
this
is
getting
to
the
basic
point
here
which
i
think
is
controlling,
what
was
the
purpose
of
this
act?
was
it
in
fact
a
police
statute
as
we
contend
it
was
and
a
proper
exercise
of
state
police
power?
is
it
primarily
concerned
with
keeping
a
particular
kind
of
driver
from
using
the
highway
and
i
think
that's
what
it
based
at?
i
think
therefore,
when
all
of
these
creditor
control
provisions
are
written,
they
say
not
only
must
he
pay
the
debt,
but
he
must
in
addition
demonstrate
financial
responsibility.
we're
not
simply,
therefore,
considering
payment
of
an
otherwise
discharged
debt.
we're
considering
that
this
class
of
drivers,
we
don't
consider
permissible
uses
of
our
highway.
the
right
to
use
our
highway
is
a
privilege
we
bestow
and
we
therefore
control
and
regulate
reasonably.
while
in
some
states,
this
is
no
longer
called
a
privilege,
but
rather
a
property
right
even
in
the
state
of
new
york
--
even
the
state
of
new
york
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief
on
page
7
and
8
citing
the
most
recent
case
even
where
new
york
recognizes
the
right
to
drive
as
a
property
right.
they
still
contend
and
hold
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
reasonably
regulate
this
use.
now,
if
the
state,
therefore,
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
power
says,
we
don't
feel
that
people
who
can't
meet
these
minimum
standards
of
responsibility,
should
properly
use
our
highway,
we
therefore
say,
we
don't
compel
you
at
the
outset
to
furnish
your
certificate
of
insurance
before
you
drive
at
all,
but
that
rather,
if
you
have
an
accident,
you
must
pay
the
damages
logically
resulting
--
provably
resulting
from
that
accident.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
the
state
on
its
own
motion?
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
in
given
instances
it
can,
your
honor,
not
from
a
matter
of
judgment.
there
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
--
another
provision
that
has
to
deal
with
accident
reports
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
no.
i
believe
in
this
instance,
it
has
to
be
initiated
by
the
creditor.
there's
no
question
about
that
but
my
point
being,
and
perhaps
indirectly
answering
your
question,
mr.
justice,
is
that
the
creditor
provision,
the
creditor
control
as
it's
been
called
here,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
gets
into
the
question
of
implementing
the
act.
this
does
not
change
its
nature
as
a
police
statute,
but
said
this
is
one
of
the
criterions.
it's
true.
you've
got
not
only
to
pay
the
judgment
but
demonstrate
financial
responsibility.
we
are
still
presently
concerned
with
financial
responsibility
and
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
we'll
take
it
away
only
for
a
while
and
you
may
or
may
not
pay
your
judgment
and
then
you
can
have
it
back.
no;
either
you
will
drive
safely
or
you
will
be
insured
or
as
you
get
in
an
accident,
you
will
pay
the
damages
resulting
from
that
accident
before
you
can
drive
again
and
you
must
after
such
an
accident
demonstrate
financial
responsibility.
you
might
have
insurance
from
that
on.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
correct.
if
you
demonstrate
your
financial
responsibility
and
again,
remember,
you
had
a
fifth
--
these
minimums
limits
of
$10,000.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
of
course,
your
honor,
there
are
certain
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
your
honor,
in
this
context,
i'll
stand
for
the
correction
of
mr.
chief
--
of
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
of
course,
there
must
be
certain
abilities
to
drive
and
test.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
nonpayment
of
a
judgment.
the
commission
cannot
act
on
its
own.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
i
believe
they
are
in
this
particular,
your
honor,
because
even
though
the
lower
court
did
rule
on
this
matter,
this
question
of
getting
the
--
having
--
requiring
the
bankrupt
to
request
the
return
of
his
license
and
getting
consent
of
the
judgment
creditor
wasn't
done
in
this
instant.
the
lower
court,
i
think,
ruled
that
this
wasn't
done
by
this
bankrupt.
it
was
obviated
by
the
fact
that
he'd
been
denied
by
the
commission
and
that
no
justiciable
controversy
arose
contesting
that
provision
and
that
wasn't
before
the
court.
the
court
just
didn't
consider
that
provision
about
the
judgment
creditor's
consent
in
restoring
a
license
so
that
they
--
in
saying
the
statute
haven't
been
complied
with,
they
just
said,
we're
not
going
to
concern
ourselves
with
that
part
of
the
statute.
i'm
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
correct.
both
the
requirements
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
--
must
be
made.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
no,
that's
the
difference.
this
is
a
distinction
between
our
statute
and
the
one
considered
in
the
reitz
case.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
it
would
have
had
to
with
an
automatic
statute,
yes.
the
clerk
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
it
was
mandatorily
required
for
the
clerk
to
forward
them
all
of
the
commission.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
oh
no.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
as
i
remember,
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
--
unless
i
am
mistaken
the
utah
act
is
entirely
the
uniform
act
and
because
it
appears
in
the
utah
act,
i'm
inclined
to
believe
it
also
occurs
in
uniform.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
i'd
be
happy
to.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
you
asked
me
and
i
answered
i
don't
know.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
through
the
drafts
memora,
but
considering
all
of
this
creditor
control,
in
summarizing,
they
are
that
the
judgment
creditor
must
initiate
the
action
and
mr.
justice
douglas
added
and
certif
--
request
that
the
judgment
be
certified
up.
then
there's
a
provision
for
a
consent
on
the
part
of
a
creditor
to
restore
the
license
on
from
prescribed
by
the
commission
and
the
showing
of
financial
responsibility
thereafter.
the
provision
it
said
the
discharge
in
bankruptcy
shall
not
affect
it.
then
there's
a
provision
that
the
limits
are
the
minimum
amounts
up
to
$10,000.
and
finally,
a
provision
that
if
in
fact
the
judgment
creditor
wants
immediate
or
a
complete
payment
that
the
judgment
debtor
in
that
instance
can
apply
to
the
court
again
in
--
which
the
judgment
was
reduced,
can
apply
to
the
court
to
be
permitted
to
make
payments
monthly
on
this
indebtedness
on
whatever
term
of
the
court
in
its
discretion
as
opposed
to
the
judgment
creditor
determined.
and
there
is
no
time
limit
set
on
it,
no
reasonable
time
period
within
which
judgment
has
to
be
paid.
this
is
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
trial
judge
who
originally
determined
the
indebtedness
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
--
all
of
these
provisions,
if
it
please
the
court,
have
the
net
effect
not
of
becoming
the
principal
concern
of
the
act
but
rather
a
concern
for
the
judgment
debtor
to
reduce
the
otherwise
harshness
of
the
act
had
it
been
nothing
more
than
the
automatic
revocation
statute
that
was
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
reitz
case.
that
is
to
say
requiring
all
judgments
to
be
docketed
whether
they
had
been
paid
or
a
private
arrangement
had
been
made
to
settle
the
matter
or
not
that
in
fact
these
are
safeguards
and
protection
for
the
judgment
debtor.
and
if
he
finds
a
recalcitrant
creditor,
he
first
can
go
see
him
privately
and
say,
“can't
we
resolve
this
matter?”
and
if
he
can
do
this,
the
judgment
creditor
fails
to
certify
up
a
request
the
judgment
setup,
his
license
remains
intact.
if
he
can't
do
this
and
the
judgment
is
set
up,
he
still
has
the
right
assuming
that
the
creditor
is
doing
what
is
contended
here,
go
into
court
and
ask
the
court
to
set
whatever
monthly
payment
he
can
afford
to
pay
and
thereby
get
a
restitution
of
his
license
so
that
he
can
continue
to
drive.
these
provisions
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
designed
to
soften
an
otherwise
harsh
effect
of
the
act
and
that
justice
hand
--
judge
hand
pointed
out
in
the
lower
court's
three-judge
decision
in
the
reitz
case,
it
is
best
calculated
to
do
the
clerk's
work
for
him
if
you
put
the
responsibility
on
the
judgment
creditor
to
see
to
it
that
the
judgment
is
set
up
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out.
and
the
other
basis
if
--
another
analogy
as
pointed
out
by
the
court
below
in
this
case
in
which
it
argued
in
holding
unanimously
that
this
act
was
constitutional
that
for
example
in
a
criminal
statute,
the
complaining
witness
is
the
party,
sometimes
the
aggrieved
party,
the
injured
party
who
has
to
initiate
the
beginning
of
the
criminal
action
and
supposing
carrying
it
to
the
logical
conclusion
that
it
were
to
say
a
burglary
and
the
complaining
witness
signed
a
complaint.
the
burglar
is
tried.
he
is
convicted
and
perhaps
placed
on
probation
and
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
probation
is
to
make
full
restitution.
i
reckon
it
could
be
there
said
that
the
complaining
witness
survived
yet
benefited
directly,
personally
as
a
result
of
that
order
of
restitution
and
having
initiated
this
action.
but
the
fact
that
the
complaining
witness
is
directly
benefited
does
not
change
the
nature
of
the
statute
and
make
it
no
longer
a
police
statute
or
a
proper
exercise
of
the
state
police
power,
the
fact
that
he
has
benefited
or
recompressed
is
incidental
to
the
proper
exercise
by
the
state
of
its
police
power.
and
surely,
if
this
court
is
willing
to
say
that
where
such
a
statute
required
mandatory
forwarding
of
these
judgments
to
the
commission
as
being
constitutional
at
a
proper
exercise
of
the
state
police
power,
surely
then,
where
there
are
other
safeguards
designed
to
facilitate
and
ease
the
burden
on
the
judgment
debtor.
this
type
of
statute
is
unconstitutional.
it
seemed
to
the
matter
of
fact
to
put
the
court
--
put
the
state
in
the
natural
consequence
of
things
if
these
acts
were
to
be
held
to
be
--
by
this
court
to
be
unconstitutional
would
mean
that
the
state
would
thereby
have
to
impose
the
requirement
of
insurance
on
all
drivers.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
right.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
really
(inaudible).
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
this
is
possible,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
no.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
what
the
following
provision
is
designed
to
prevent,
your
honor,
and
perhaps
i
didn't
properly
emphasize
it.
but
in
the
event
that
you
have
such
a
recalcitrant
judgment
creditor,
who
will
not
say
you've
got
to
pay
me
every
penny
and
every
other
most
part
of
it
or
i
won't
consent.
there
are
two
provisions;
once
he's
paid
the
minimal
amounts,
the
judgment
creditor
have
nothing
further
but
assuming
nothing
had
fail
as
you
said
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
assuming
--
assuming
if
nothing
has
said,
agreed.
assuming
that
what
you
have
said
about
no
payment
being
made
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
there
is
still
the
alternative
for
the
judgment
creditor
to
go
then
into
the
court
where
the
judgment
was
obtained
and
asked
the
court,
having
made
a
full
disclosure
to
him
what
his
financial
situation
is.
now,
mr.
judge,
you
tell
me
what
i
can
and
can't
pay
and
in
what
amounts
and
when
and
take
as
much
time
even
perhaps
i
presume,
determine
whether
interest
shall
be
collected
or
added
or
compounded
on
this
matter
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
--
so
that
if
i
have
such
a
judgment
creditor
that
gets
--
will
not
consent
to
my
return.
i
can
go
and
get
the
court
to
work
out
whatever
terms
are
most
satisfactory
to
me
in
the
court's
description,
not
in
the
creditors
but
the
court's
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
pardon?
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that
is
section
41-12-17,
your
honor
and
it
appears
at
page
7
in
the
record.
i
think
i
quoted
it
in
my
brief
also
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
in
jurisdictional
statement,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
40
--
yes,
41-12-17
subdivision
(b).
the
commission
shall
not
suspend
a
license
registration
of
a
non-resident
operative
privilege
and
shall
restore
a
license
registration
(inaudible)
whether
or
not
operative
privilege
suspended
following
nonpayment
of
judgment
when
the
judgment
debtor
gives
proof
of
financial
responsibility
and
obtain
such
an
order,
permitting
the
payment
of
such
judgment
in
installments
and
while
the
payment
of
any
such
installment
is
not
in
default.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
(voice

--
previous
section
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
yes,
pardon?
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
he
may
give
it
by
installment,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe,
however,
this
doesn't
limit
the
court's
prerogative
to
work
out
whatever
terms.
it
says
he
can
apply.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
at
the
court's
--
should
order,
that's
what
--
that's
all
the
court
will
consider
then
in
effect
what
the
--
then
you've
just
transferred
the
creditor
into
the
judge
and
the
judges
are
recalcitrant
and
in
that
instance,
then
the
state
is
powerless
but
only
in
that
instance.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
there
are
no
--
there
are
no
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
what
it
appears
to
me
to
be,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that
the
license
has
written
forthwith
as
soon
as
the
order
is
entered
and
so
long
as
the
judgment
debtor
is
not
in
default
on
any
monthly
payment.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
one
of
the
criterions
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
i
agree
mr.
justice.
i
don't
know
how
we
can
avoid
that
fact.
there
are
incidental
benefits
to
the
creditor,
but
our
position
is
this
does
not
change
the
nature
of
the
act
of
the
statute
itself
that
it
principally,
primarily
an
exercise
of
the
state
police
power,
a
proper
such
exercise,
one
which
has
been
widely
done
and
i
should
add
further
that
not
only
the
21
states
have
adopted
the
creditor
control
provisions
or
the
model
act,
but
virtually
all
the
other
states
have
some
kind
of
safety
responsibility
act
and
most
of
the
remaining
ones
have
the
automatic
provision,
that
is
the
one
that
just
said
the
judgment
shall
be
forwarded
up
the
license,
shall
be
suspended
some
for
a
limited
period
and
many
permanently.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
no,
well
--
yes.
but
assuming
you
don't
have
it
all
paid
in
three
years.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
i
believe
you're
quoting
the
language
of
mr.
justice
douglas
into
defending
the
right
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
i
believe,
your
honor
that
unless
you
have
some
kind
of
permanent
revocation,
it
is
no
sanction
at
all,
that
is
to
say
it
is
not
affecting
that
cannot
be
easily
avoided.
and
i
think
this
is
our
final
point
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
that
to
permit
a
person
to
circumvent
the
purposes
of
this
act
by
the
simple
expedient
of
bankruptcy
is
to
work
an
undue
hardship
on
the
person
who
happened
to
be
--
that
happens
to
be
victim
of
the
first
accident.
assuming
for
a
moment
we
wipe
out
the
statute,
we
declare
it
unconstitutional,
so
then
there
is
no
such
creditor
control,
there
is
no
taking
away
of
a
license
for
being
in
an
accident
even
though
you're
uninsured.
so
a
party
gets
into
an
accident.
he
is
responsible.
he
is
adjudged
the
judgment
debtor
and
subsequently
discharges
that
debt
in
bankruptcy.
this
then
wipes
out
the
judgment
creditor
in
that
instance
while
if
in
fact
the
same
man
gets
into
another
accident
within
six
years,
he
can't
discharge
that
one
in
bankruptcy
so
that
one
can
be
collected.
so,
what
we're
saying
to
everybody,
you
get
one
free
accident
in
our
state.
you
can
have
one
free
accident.
you
don't
need
to
be
insured.
you
don't
need
to
be
financially
responsible.
you
can
discharge
it
by
the
simple
expedient
of
bankruptcy,
but
thereafter
when
bankruptcy
can't
be
used
as
your
shield,
you're
in
trouble.
i
don't
think
that
this
statute
is
designed
to
be
frustrated
in
that
fashion
and
i
don't
believe
the
bankruptcy
act
was
designed
to
provide
that
of
protection.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
it
did.
it
is
not
now.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
now
permanent
as
well,
your
honor
and
incidentally
the
creditors
control
and
contrary
to
what
counsel
argues
in
his
brief,
they
were
amended
out
as
he
indicated
in
1941
but
only
as
part
of
reenacting
of
this
model
code
and
the
creditor
control
provision
still
remain
in
the
new
york
act
as
much
as
they
appear
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
it
does
have
a
separability
clause
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
there
are
no
other
provisions
unfortunately,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
to
what
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
in
this
area
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
it's
a
general
separability
clause.
as
i
understand
the
statutory
construction,
the
whole
section
would
have
to
be
taken
out
which
would
mean
that
the
area
of
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
--
judgment
debtor
would
no
longer
affect
financial
responsibility,
no
longer
affect
the
commission.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
i
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
agreed
except
i
may
have
misled
your
honor
in
one
particular,r
partial
payment
up
to
the
minimum
requirement.
i
don't
believe
the
court
could
for
example
say,
i
--
in
your
fact
situation
say,
you
only
need
to
pay
$5000
where
the
statute
requires
$10,000.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
up
to
that
amount
on
whatever
term
the
court
determines,
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
it
may
very
well
have,
your
honor.
i
venture
to
mention
it
to
--
in
--
with
regard
to
legislative
intent
that
not
only
with
a
committee
report
but
both
in
the
senate
and
the
house
in
utah
legislature,
the
act
was
read
three
times
in
the
passed
without
any
debate.
so
we
have
no
guide
to
tell
us
what
the
legislature
intended
if
one
part
restricting
or
another
were
lifted.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
whatever
installments
he
chooses
or
whatever
time
period
the
court
determines.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
let's
say
that
the
court
would
ordinarily
pay
$10,000
on
whatever
terms
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
--
it
determines
and
give
back
the
license.
whatever
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
--
other
remedy
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
--
is
then
available
to
the
creditor
would
be
a
material
as
a
part
of
the
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
i'd
be
happy
to
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
burton,
but
is
--
black,
excuse
me,
but
i
understand
that
you
can't
piecemeal
take
clauses
out
of
sections
when
you
separate
it.
if
that
could
be
done
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
as
i
understand
the
settled
on
statutory
construction,
he
came
from
our
state
and
we
take
him
as
kind
of
a
bible
perhaps
his
opinion
is
and
i
haven't
fairly
briefed
the
subject
that
you
can't
rewrite
sentences
that
you
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
--
we
should
take
out
a
section
or
sentence
at
a
time.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
but
unfortunately
this
is
just
a
clause
in
a
sentence.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
and
it
uses
them
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
unfortunately,
the
wording
in
the
utah
act,
this
uniform
act
says
section
and
i'm
afraid
that
would
be
construed
to
mean
the
entire
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
--
(voice
overlap).
it
is
not
quoted
in
the
record,
your
honor.
the
separability
clause
does
not
appear
in
the
record
but
it's
--
it
is
in
the
act
and
i
believe
in
the
language
and
i'm
going
by
memory,
if
any
section
of
this
act
is
put
out
unconstitutional,
the
remainder
of
the
act
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
i'd
be
happy
to
research
that
for
the
court,
your
honor
if
that's
a
possibility
but
i
have
just
got
on
the
assumption
that
they
can't
take
merely
a
phrase
or
clause
out
of
a
sentence.
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
i
don't
know
but
i
will
be
glad
to
furnish
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
a.
madsen
well,
i'm
sure
that
it
came
after
the
bankruptcy
act.
if
we're
imputing
--
null
it
to
congress,
it
would
have
come
after
it
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
