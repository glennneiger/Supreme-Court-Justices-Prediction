mr.
skeen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
skeen,
did
the
court
below
determine
whether
the
petitioner
had
complied
with
the
--
with
the
provisions
of
state
law
concerning
the
restoration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
did
he
comply
with
the
act?
did
they
find
that
he
complied
with
the
act
in
making
his
petition
for
restoration?
i
think
he
could
have
under
that
act
could
have
shown
financial
responsibility
and
have
had
it
restored
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
at
least
notwithstanding.
now,
did
he
--
did
the
court
find
whether
he'd
complied
with
that
section
of
the
law
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
skeen,
that's
the
reason
i
asked
you
if
that
particular
portion
of
your
act
had
been
passed
on
by
the
court
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
is
a
escape
hatch
though,
this
provision
about
subsequently
showing
financial
responsibility.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
must
pay
in
addition
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
addition
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
madsen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
madsen
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
provision,
restoration
provisions
are
properly
before
us
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
is
true
--
it
is
true,
is
it,
that
the
--
that
they
could
not
restore
the
license
if
they
did
not
pay
the
judgment
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
even
though
they
were
able
to
provide
adequate
insurance
for
the
future?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
madsen,
may
i
interrupt
you
just
once
more.
you
mentioned
this
is
a
uniform
law
and
that
there
were
21
states
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
a
uniform
law
include
this
restoration
provision
as
you
have
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
you
and
the
counsel
could
agree
on
the
little
memorandum
on
that
issue
and
submit
it
to
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
do
that
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
madsen,
may
i
ask
you
this,
just
this
one
more
question.
assume
that
the
judgment
debtor
has
a
judgment
for
20
--
judgment
creditor
has
a
judgment
for
$20,000
and
the
license
is
revoked.
and
later,
the
driver
makes
an
application
for
restoration.
no
part
of
that
--
no
part
of
that
judgment
has
been
paid.
does
the
judgment
creditor
have
the
right
to
say,
“well,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
this
isn't
paid,
i
permit
him
to
apply
for
and
get
a
restoration
of
his
license,”
is
--
can
he
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
if
he
can
do
that,
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
state
putting
him
in
the
driver's
seat
under
this
act
in
giving
him
the
right
to
say
from
that
time
on,
the
rest
of
the
debtor's
life
whether
or
not
he
can
drive
because
if
that
--
if
he
will
never
say,
if
he
will
never
consent
to
the
man
getting
the
--
his
license
restored
then
the
state
is
powerless
ever
to
restore
it?
now,
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
part
of
the
case
that
bothers
me
more
than
the
initial,
initial
part
of
it.
i
think
the
state
does
have
a
right
under
the
police
power
to
do
this,
but
i
wonder
if
that
doesn't
put
the
creditor
in
the
driver's
seat
from
that
time
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
$10,000
is
a
lot
--
$10,000
is
a
lot
of
money
to
some
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
it
can
--
under
your
state
law
he
can
wipe
out
a
judgment
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
madsen,
does
your
act
have
a
severability
clause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
now,
may
i
ask
this.
if
this
particular
section
was
struck
down
just
as
to
the
creditor
control
on
the
return
of
the
license,
would
that
seriously
affect
the
state
if
--
that
had
the
other
provisions
in
there
giving
the
court
the
right
to
agree
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
you'd
say
every
section,
subsection
clause
or
--
so
forth
is
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
whole
section?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
skeen.
