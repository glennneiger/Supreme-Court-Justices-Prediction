mr.
e.
j.
skeen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court,
denying
injunctive
relief
against
the
enforcement
of
the
utah
safety
responsibility
statute.
we
contend
that
the
utah
statute
conflicts
with
section
17
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
is
therefore
void.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
read
a
brief
reference
from
the
section
--
sections
of
the
statute
that
we
have
in
question
here.
they
are
found
on
pages
3
and
4
of
my
brief.
“whenever
any
person
fails,
within
60
days,
to
satisfy
any
judgment
upon
the
written
request
of
the
judgment
creditor
or
his
attorney,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
clerk
of
the
court
or
the
judge
of
a
court
which
has
no
clerk
in
which
such
a
judgment
is
rendered
within
the
state
to
forward
to
the
commission
immediately
after
expiration
of
said
60
days,
a
certified
copy
of
the
judgment.”
the
following
section
provides
that
upon
the
receipt
of
the
certified
copy
of
the
judgment,
the
commission
shall
suspend
the
license
and
the
registration
of
the
judgment
debtor’s
vehicle
and
then
follows
a
subsection,
“if
the
judgment
creditor
consents
in
writing
in
such
form
as
the
commission
may
prescribe
that
the
judgment
debtor
be
allowed
license
and
registration
or
non-operating
residence
operating
privilege,
the
same
maybe
allowed
by
the
commission
in
its
discretion
for
six
months,
from
the
date
of
such
consent
and
thereafter
until
the
consent
is
revoked.”
the
following
section
provides
that
such
license
and
registration
shall
remain
so
suspended
and
shall
not
be
renewed
or
shall
any
such
license
registration
be
thereafter
issued
in
the
name
of
the
person
unless
and
until
such
judgment
is
stayed,
satisfied
in
full
or
to
the
extent
hereinafter
provided
and
until
the
said
person
gives
proof
of
financial
responsibility,
then
follows
this
statement.
“the
discharge
in
bankruptcy
following
the
rendering
of
any
such
judgment
shall
not
relieve
the
judgment
debtor
from
any
of
the
requirements
of
the
act.”
the
following
section
provides
for
application
for
--
to
the
court
for
relief,
but
it’s
not
involved
in
this
case.
now,
we
take
the
position,
your
honors,
that
the
provisions
of
the
statute
i
have
read
give
the
creditor
a
measure
of
control
of
the
suspension
and
renewal
of
the
driver's
license
which
in
effect
puts
into
operation
a
collection
device
and
what
in
effect,
write
into
the
section
17
of
the
bankruptcy
act
another
exception,
which
we
contend
would
be
clearly
contrary
to
the
constitutional
provision
granting
to
the
congress
the
right
to
establish
the
power
and
authority
to
establish
a
uniform
bankruptcy
law.
section
17,
your
honors
will
recall,
provides
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy
shall
release
a
bankrupt
from
all
his
provable
debts.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
such
as
to
squarely
raise
this
question.
the
bankrupt,
appellant
here,
was
sued
in
a
state
court.
a
judgment
was
recovered
against
him.
the
judgment
creditor
immediately
requested
that
the
copy
of
the
judgment
be
sent
to
the
commission.
the
commission
suspended
his
driver's
license
and
registration
certificate
and
the
--
following
that,
the
bankrupt
or
the
judgment
debtor,
filed
a
petition
in
bankruptcy
and
he
was
discharged.
following
his
discharge,
the
bankrupt
made
a
written
application
to
the
commission
to
restore
his
driver's
license.
that
application
was
denied
and
the
letter
denying
it,
which
is
in
the
record,
the
commission
stated
that
--
quoted
this
provision
that
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy
shall
not
relieve
the
judgment
debtor.
the
bankrupt
then
filed
this
proceeding
in
the
bankruptcy
court
to
assure
to
him
the
fruits
of
the
litigation
and
to
get
injunctive
relief
through
the
bankruptcy
court
against
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
contending
as
i
stated
that
the
statute
is
void
because
it
conflicts
with
the
bankruptcy
law.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
we
submitted
the
case
on
a
stipulated
set
of
facts
which
outlined
what
the
judgment
debtor
had
done
and
it's
clear
in
this
case
that
there
was
a
request
by
the
judgment
creditor
under
the
statute
and
we
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
--
before
starting
the
proceeding,
the
bankrupt
made
a
timely
application
to
have
his
license
restored.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
yes.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
the
court
made
no
formal
findings
in
the
case
we
submitted
it
on
the
stipulated
set
of
facts
to
the
three-judge
court
and
the
--
it's
certainly
clear
that
there
is
no
question
about
that
based
on
the
case
before
the
three-judge
court.
now,
this
case
your
honor
--
honors
--
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
well,
i
might
answer
it
in
this
way,
your
honor.
the
bankrupt
judgment
debtor
made
a
written
request
for
restoration,
setting
up
his
discharge
in
bankruptcy
and
the
relief
was
denied
by
the
state
not
because
he
didn't
tender
performance
under
the
--
by
showing
that
he
had
insurance,
but
simply
because
the
discharge
in
bankruptcy
didn't
entitle
him
to
get
the
first
base
on
the
question.
that
--
that
factually
stopped
any
further
proceedings
to
get
the
license
renewed.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
if
he
--
if
he
were
sued
on
the
debt,
of
course,
the
discharge
would
be
controlling
--
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
well,
of
course
admittedly,
the
cases
hold
that
the
bankruptcy
act
simply
destroys
the
procedure
to
collect
the
debt.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
the
debt
is
still
there.
however,
the
position
we
take
and
urge
is
that
the
state
has
no
right
by
this
sort
of
legislation
to
inject
another
exception
into
section
17.
and
we
contend
that
that's
exactly
what
is
happening
here
because
of
the
element
of
creditor
control
in
the
case.
now,
in
the
reitz
case,
the
court
concluded
that
had
the
clerk
by
a
force
of
law
been
required
to
certify
the
judgment
in
and
had
the
creditor
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
that
it
would
be
--
would
not
contravene
the
bankruptcy
act
and
would
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power
and
constitutional,
but
in
that
case,
we
had
the
same
problem
involved
here
except
that
in
this
case,
we
think
that
there
can
be
no
severability
of
the
creditor
controlled
features
of
the
law.
your
honors
will
recall
that
in
the
reitz
case
which
involved
the
new
york
statute,
the
statute
as
originally
enacted
simply
provided
for
the
certification
of
the
judgment
to
the
commission
and
the
commission
was
thereupon
authorized
to
suspend
the
operation
of
the
law
for
a
period
of
three
years
--
or
the
license
for
a
period
of
three
years.
then
in
1936,
new
york
amended
the
statute
to
permit
the
creditor,
judgment
creditor,
to
allow
six
months
use
of
the
suspended
license
and
then
in
1939,
the
new
york
statute
was
amended
to
provide
for
suspension
only
upon
action
of
the
judgment
creditor.
now,
those
two
amendments,
1939
and
1936
are
substantially
the
same
as
our
statute
laws
when
it
was
enacted
as
a
whole.
we
did
not
go
at
it
piecemeal.
the
entire
statute
was
enacted
as
a
whole
and
we
think
that
clearly,
there
was
no
possibility
of
these
creditor
control
provisions
being
severable
from
the
rest
of
the
statute.
if
they
were
taken
out
of
the
statute,
it
wouldn't
be
what
the
legislature
intended
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
sense
to
the
rest
of
the
statute.
so
we
take
the
position
in
this
case
that
we
have
now
submitted
to
this
court
for
decision
the
question
that
was
not
decided
in
the
reitz
case
because
the
court
took
the
position
that
the
1936
and
1939
amendments
were
severable
from
the
rest
of
the
statute
and
that
if
there
is
a
--
if
they're
unconstitutional,
the
original
statute
was
constitutional
and
sustained
it.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
sir.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
that's
right.
and
there
is
another
limitation,
the
judgment
debtor
may
pay
up
to
$10,000
as
i
remember
arising
out
of
one
accident
and
be
relieved
if
he
--
for
example,
there
happened
to
be
a
$30,000
or
$40,000
judgment
against
him,
he
could
pay
up
to
a
minimum
and
be
relieved.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
well,
that's
of
course
is
a
good
question.
however,
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
from
a
practical
standpoint,
there
are
some
reasons
for
judge
hand's
statement,
however,
the
statute
doesn't
stop
there.
it
goes
right
on
and
puts
in
the
hands
of
a
judgment
creditor
the
right
to
restore
the
license
for
a
period
of
six
months
--
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
--
or
permanently.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
the
--
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
well,
the
court
did
not
pass
on
the
question
as
it's
been
presented
to
be
here.
it's
just
been
assumed
throughout
that
his
efforts
to
get
his
license
restored
had
been
nipped
in
the
bud,
so
to
speak.
he
made
a
request
for
restoration
and
they
rejected
it
so
there's
nothing
else
for
him
to
do.
it'd
been
an
idle
act
to
go
off
and
say,
“well,
i
can
buy
some
insurance.”
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
a
simple
matter
to
get
insurance
and
that
didn't
come
in
to
the
picture
at
all.
they
simply
nipped
his
efforts
to
get
his
license
right
at
the
beginning.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
that's
true.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
but
--
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
that's
alright
as
far
as
it
goes,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
it
doesn't
make
him
a
better
driver
--
doesn't
make
him
a
better
driver
because
he
happens
to
be
able
to
pay.
he
--
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
he
--
he's
still
may
be
a
bad
risk
on
the
highway,
but
a
driver
who
can
pay,
turn
over
the
money
is
free
to
use
the
highway.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
whereas
one
who's
a
poor
man
and
can't
pay,
he
is
permanently
deprived
of
using
an
automobile.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
well,
i
think
personally
that
there's
a
great
merit
to
that
suggestion.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
that's
one
important
difference.
this
new
york
statute
was
a
three-year
statute,
ours
is
permanent.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
plus
paying.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
plus
paying.
you
see,
he
can't
get
it
--
his
suspension
lifted
simply
because
he
can
show
financial
responsibility
--
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
he
must
pay
in
addition.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
yes.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
he
must
pay
in
addition
and
that's
the
part
that
we
believe
makes
it
contrary
to
the
purpose
and
intent
of
section
17
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
he
must
also
pay.
and
his
--
as
i
indicated
before,
there
is
a
--
he
can
pay
up
to
a
certain
amount
but
it
is
a
large
sum
for
a
man
who
is
--
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
--
in
the
position
of
this
bankrupt.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
yes.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
that's
right.
in
the
--
we
think
that
if
for
example,
a
legislature
through
--
under
its
police
power
of
the
state
passed
a
law
to
the
effect
that
no
judgment
based
on
negligence
on
a
public
highway
shall
be
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
say,
we
--
a
state
had
the
nerve
to
enact
such
a
law,
that
would
clearly
i
think
all
agree
would
be
contrary
to
the
bankruptcy
act.
now
this,
as
far
as
the
practical
effect
of
this
statute
is
concerned,
it's
just
the
same.
the
legislature
has
said
that
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy
shall
not
relieve
the
judgment
debtor
of
the
requirements
of
this
act
and
that
puts
a
leverage
on
the
judgment
debtor
that
makes
it
impossible
for
him
to
either
drive
which
is
just
about
a
necessity
of
life
or
pay.
and
we
have
some
states
enacting
such
laws
others
don't
and
the
purpose
of
having
a
uniform
bankruptcy
law
in
the
united
states
is
destroyed
by
this
type
of
legislation.
we
submit
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
three-judge
court
and
strike
the
statute
down
as
unconstitutional.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
counsel
in
his
brief
makes
a
statement
that
i
wanted
to
make
one
comment
about.
on
page
13,
he
says,
appellee
respectfully
submits
that
this
court
should
find
that
the
state
policy
of
preventing
financially
irresponsible
drivers
from
using
its
highways
outweighs
whatever
intrusion
the
act
may
incidentally
make
into
the
field
of
bankruptcy.
now,
that
sounds
alright,
but
i
don't
believe
this
is
a
kind
of
a
case
where
the
court
can
weigh
equities.
i
think
that
the
court
has
to
determine
whether
this
statute
we're
attacking
makes
any
intrusion
or
whatever
in
the
field
of
bankruptcy.
if
it
makes
any
intrusion,
the
statute
is
void.
it's
not
a
matter
of
weighing
equities.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
that's
right.
mr.
e.
j.
skeen
it's
absolute.
if
there's
any
intrusion,
the
statute
is
void
as
contrary
to
that
provision
of
the
constitution.
thank
you.
