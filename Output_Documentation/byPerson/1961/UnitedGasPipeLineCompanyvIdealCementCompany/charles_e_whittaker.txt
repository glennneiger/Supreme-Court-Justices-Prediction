justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
beggs,
at
that
time,
was
there
some
point
to
which
you
can
slip
in
where
the
interstate
commerce
ended
and
intrastate
commerce
began
as
respect
to
the
gas
distributed
in
mobile?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
beggs,
(inaudible),
would
you
contend
that
this
transportation
by
united
gas
was
interstate
in
character,
all
the
away
to
ideal
burners?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
do
you
contend
that
it
was
interstate
commerce
all
the
way
that
there
never
was
a
time
when
this
particular
gas
(inaudible)
ceased
to
be
in
interstate
commerce
and
became
local
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
what
judge
rives
held,
wasn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
agree
it
was
all
interstate
commerce
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
movement?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
how
can
it
tax,
the
privilege
or
that
the
city
tax
privilege
of
doing
interstate
business?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
but
why?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
interstate
carried
from
the
commerce
had
ended
at
the
plant
site,
hasn't
it,
where
local
commerce
began?
that's
how
(voice
overlap)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
i
can't
understand
i
think
mr.
beggs
on
this
is
the
power
of
mobile
to
levy
even
a
sales
tax
under
the
privilege
of
commerce.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
whether
that
to
say
then
that
an
interstate
carrier
may
not
make
a
sale?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
locally
if
he
makes
the
sale?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
then
became
interstate
commerce
--
interstate
commerce
all
the
way
up
to
the
consumers'
burners?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
right
at
that
point,
it
became
local
in
character.
