was
the

the
local
taxation
by
the
local

contested
in

just
for
you

make
an

what
was
the
inter-corporate
relation,
if
any,
between
mobile
and
united,
i'm
not
(voice

justice

what?
justice
felix

none.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
all
those
--
in
those
cases
on
which
--
which
--
on
which
you
rely,
were
those
cases
where
there
were
ownership
of
the
commodity
sold,
the
physical
transfer
from
out-of-state
directly
through
the
out-of-state
seller
into
the
hands
of
local
the
buyer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
i
know
that
case,
but
what
--
that
was
not
a
case
where
the
whole
transaction
from
the
beginning
of
the
commercial
transactions
to
the
end
was
in
the
control
of,
in
the
direction
of,
in
the
ownership
of
the
interstate
business
enterprise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
--
there
was
break
in
--
in
mcgoldrick
and
berwind-white.
now,
there
is
a
physical
break
here
in
the
sense
that
the
local
--
that
it
go
--
that
the
sale
to
the
ultimate
consumer
is
the
local
transaction.
but
the
transmission
of
the
gas
from
out
of
the
state
finally
to
the
hands
of
the
homeowner
in
mobile
is
all
unbrokenly.
i'm
not
saying
this
is
--
i'm
pursuing
this.
i'm
fully
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
the
subject,
but
the
fact
that
the
incident
of
the
sale
is
local
doesn't
put
an
end
to
the
question,
it
doesn't
answer
it,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know
but
the
fact
that
the
sale
takes
place
there
doesn't
answer
the
commerce
clause
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
answer.
i'm
not
(voice
overlap)
the
fact
that
you
can
say
localizing
of
sale
of
a
continuous
transaction
from
texas
oil
fields
to
alabama
doesn't
mean
that
because
the
incident
can
be
broken
up
as
phenomenon
local
to
mobile,
but
that's
an
end
of
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
beggs
may
i
suggest
if
you'll
permit
me,
that
i
think
you
have
to
make
--
mean
the
last
sentence
in
per
curiam
opinion
on
rehearing
on
page
128,
i
say
that
was
written
by
judge
rives,
but
last
sentence
i
think
summarizes
the
conflict
and
controversy
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
held
that
the
taxes
on
the
act
of
privilege
of
delivering
the
gas
in
the
city
of
mobile
that
--
this
on
the
page
5.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
the
incidence
of
the
tax
or
incident,
i
take
it
means
that
was
the
tax
goes
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
that
is
not
the
case
as
i
understood
that
justice
black
gave
you.
he
said
and
the
local
dealers
and
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
about
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
might
be
business
reasons
why
you
can't
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
domain
of
taxation,
in
the
domain
of
commerce,
business
arrangements
are
made
which
may
carry
undesirable
consequences
and
you
can
hypothetically
say
you
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
encounter
all
hypothetically
(voice

that's
quite
true,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
it
wouldn't
--
maybe
it
wouldn't
mr.
rhyne.
you
can't
hypothesize
these
states.
business
affairs
aren't
just
conducted
to
respond
to
legal
conflict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
sometimes
are,
it's
sometimes
can't
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
then
it'd
be
all
of
the
difference
in
the
world
between
dealing
with
six
big
commercial
consumers
and
dealing
with
thousands
local
consumers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
difference
in
the
world?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
quite
true
mr.
rhyne.
if
in
fact
it
is
a
tax
on
commerce
then
the
fact
that
interstate
commerce
enjoy
--
enjoy
the
immunity
from
state
taxation
which
the
local
competitor
does
not
makes
no
difference
because
the
discrimination
then
is
against
interstate
commerce
as
such.
and
in
that
connection,
i
wish
you
to
address
yourself
in
good
time
to
the
use
that
judge
rives
made
of
section
19
of
the
ordinance,
on
page
113
and
114
and
he
concludes
thus
united
must
pay
a
tax
each
year
before
it
can
supply
gas
to
scout
and
ideal
within
the
city
of
mobile.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
quotes
that
--
the
difficulty
i
have
with
this
case
is
the
conflict
as
what
this
ordinance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
says
and
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
facts
--
he
quotes
section
19
and
italicizes
that
it
cannot
do
this
without
having
first
obtained
tax
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
the
section
19
relevant
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
came
up
from
the
state,
we
would
be
bound
by
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
--
they
are
troubling
to
me
mr.
rhyne
in
order
to
disclose
you
my
trouble,
along
the
line
of
justice
brennan's
question.
here
is
a
consideration
of
what
this
ordinance
mean
or
what
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
and
apparently
this
case
was
argued
in
april
--
on
april
20th,
1960
and
then
there
was
--
it
was
considered
by
the
three
judges.
it
then
held
under
advisement.
they
filed
a
corrected
opinion
on
the
september
2nd,
1960.
petition
for
rehearing
in
which
these
matters
were
urged
was
filed
and
there's
an
opinion
that
rather
unusual
thing,
certainly
for
this
court
as
i
--
as
i
see
its
manifestation,
a
month
later
there
is
an
opinion
on
rehearing
in
which
from
your
point
of
view,
the
court
is
absolutely
fairer,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
didn't
suggest
that.
it
just
gives
me
thought
in
saying,
the
court
was
all
wrong
and
counsel
is
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
--
i
should
think,
you
would
think
that
a
natural
trouble,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
--
did
mr.
beggs
argue
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
--
i
should
assume
in
the
matter
of
course
that
from
your
point
of
view
you
pressed
the
mcgoldrick
case
hard
on
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
even
referred
to
as
you
read
his
opinion,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
--
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
am
saying
is
that
this
is
the
very
far
reaching
error
of
this,
if
error
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
case
isn't
even
mentioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
--
suppose
judge
rives
was
right
and
suppose
section
19
which
he
sets
forth
on
page
113
and
114
or
the
governing
section
and
he's
commentary
on
it
in
that
401,
66.
suppose,
he
was
right
and
i
would
ask
you
the
right
--
well
understand,
you
could
say
within
your
case.
but
you
would
have
a
very
different
case
wouldn't
you
or
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
don't
you
--
you
don't
carry
me
along
if
they
invoke
the
principle
that
there's
no
discrimination
against
that
--
that
local
commerce
is
on
an
equal
footing
because
i
must
repeat
at
--
at
the
heart
of
it
issue,
problem
commerce
clause
is
that
interstate
commerce
has
a
right
of
free
and
free
no
matter
what
the
consequences
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
does
section
16
help
us
to
determine
this
by
itself
what
is
or
what
is
not
in
any
unlawful
tax
on
interstate
commerce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
--
it
helped
us
to
ascertain
when
it
is
and
when
it
isn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
is
then
it
--
and
it's
not
included.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
whole
question
is,
is
it
or
isn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
if
since
you
evidently
--
inadvertently
referred
to
the
section
15,
before
you
directed
me,
i
looked
at
it
and
that
it
has
the
comprehensive
description
of
whether
amount
of
the
license
is
making
the
trend
or
so
on
and
so
on
or
amount
of
sales,
this
ordinance
except
where
otherwise
specified.
now
that
deals
with
amount
of
--
where
the
amount
of
a
license
is
made
to
depend
on
the
amount
of
sales.
this
ordinance
except
where
otherwise
specified.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
amount
whether
there
is
anything
otherwise
specified?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
--
perhaps
i
would
ask
mr.
beggs
when
he
gets
on
his
feet
again,
i
assume
he
will.
in
the
petition
for
rehearing,
i
notice
that
the
first
provision
said
that,
there's
no
other
thing
important
on
a
proposition
where
this
petition
is
granted
only
the
unrelated
question
of
whether
the
tax
had
to
be
paid
before
united
states
--
before
united
could
exercise
the
privilege
of
selling
its
gas
has
been
considered
or
argued.
evidently,
that
was
argued
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
were
you
in
the
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'll
ask
him
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
gas
the
only
one
that
has
no
fixed
amount?
i
should
just
suppose
if
the
basis
--
section
15
certainly
contemplate
getting
money
on
the
basis
of
gross
sales,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
if
any
other
business
called
upon
required
to
--
or
exacting
from
other
business
in
which
the
exacting
is
to
be
ascertained
from
the
value,
from
either
the
amount
of
the
capital
invested
or
the
value
of
the
goods
or
the
amount
of
sales?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i'm
not
referring
to
the
gas
companies.
section
15
is
a
scheme
for
ascertaining
the
amounts
payable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
the
amount
is
fixed
for
a
form
broker
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
plumber
or
whatnot
and
it's
just
a
question
of
how
many
dollars.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
section
15
contemplates
exactions
from
commercial
enterprises
in
which
the
exaction
is
not
fixed
but
it's
an
ascertainable
amount
dependent
on
capital
invested,
value
of
goods,
or
amount
of
sales.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
any
other
businesses
from
which
exactions
have
to
be
made
would
come
within
this
ordinance
in
other
words
in
any
other
type
of
business
would
come
within
this
ordinance
and
the
--
basis
of
ascertaining
the
amount
is
--
turns
on
--
it
is
the
function
of
the
capital
invested
or
the
value
of
the
goods
or
the
amount
of
sale,
is
there
any
other
commercial
enterprise
within
the
scope
other
the
gas
companies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
amount
of
the
sales
or
the
amount
of
capital
invested
or
the
value
of
the
goods?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
true
of
every
one
of
these
businesses.
a
new
business
has
the
basis
on
which
you
can
calculate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
point
is
--
but
if
it
says
the
amount
of
the
sales,
it
can't
have
a
minimum
amount
unless
it
says
in
default
of
having
any
prior
sales,
it
shall
be
x
dollars.
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay.
is
there
such
a
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
white,
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
one
kind
as
one
goes
through
this
booklet
merchants
item
259,
merchants,
wholesale,
those
run
the
amount,
the
annual
amount
runs
from
$50
to
$200
and
to
fractions
of
a
percentage,
but
they
all
are
hooked
to
the
gross
annual
business
and
it
runs
from
a
gross
annual
business
of
$25,000
to
$2
million.
no
fixed
amount
of
a
license
as
in
another
instances,
$1000
or
$50
net
but,
a
ratio
of
the
gross
annual
business
and
if
a
business
starts,
a
wholesale
business
may
present
this
same
kind
of
a
problem.
if
the
business
starts
and
new,
there
is
no
gross
annual
business
determinable
the
day
it
opened,
the
year
it
opened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you're
exacting
the
same
situation
as
the
natural
gas
companies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
i
break
in
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
an
opinion
on
rehearing.
mr.
beggs
filed
his
petition
for
rehearing
september
23rd,
1960
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
next
day,
the
entry
on
the
record,
in
the
books
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit
would
have
been
the
next
day,
september
24th
assuming
that
is
in
a
sunday,
suppose
they
just
entered
petition
for
rehearing
denied
and
suppose
we
had
no
more
than
that
mr.
white.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
have
been
out
of
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
clearly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
it
is
so
that
--
i
have
an
opinion,
i
haven't
put
my
mind
on
it,
but
the
question
is,
whether
--
what
--
what
we
find
on
pages
127
and
128
runs
the
time
on
you
in
that
those
two
pages
constitute
the
entry
of
a
judgment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
you
correct
me
if
i
understood
it
improperly,
i
have
to
go
beyond
that
and
say
that
what
appears
on
page
132,
november
16,
that's
the
time
running
from
november
16.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
that
the
mere
(inaudible)
by
the
per
curiam
the
second
petition
for
rehearing
is
denied,
although
that's
all
we
have,
clearly
that
would
not
start
and
had
been
running
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
have
a
--
not
you,
but
i
would
have
a
very
hard
time
to
attach
different
legal
significance
to
what
was
written
after
the
first
--
as
between
the
first
petition
for
rehearing
and
the
second.
in
other
words,
by
that
concern,
i
could
make
a
legal
distinction
between
the
dispositions
made
on
the
first
hearing
and
the
disposition
made
after
the
second.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
i
were
you,
i
wouldn't
argue
it,
i
would
cite
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
beggs,
may
i
ask
you
this,
as
i
understand
it,
there
were
seven
large
commercial
consumers,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
two
are
before
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
other
five
in
the
vernacular
pulled
up
or
is
that
--
or
that
case
pending.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
--
that
controversy
is
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
any
event,
i
want
to
ask
this
question.
i
understood
you
do
agree
that
if
this
construction
were
placed
upon
the
ordinance
by
the
state
court,
this
court
will
be
foreclosed
from
independent
examination
of
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yeah.
now,
was
there
at
any
time
or
even
your
petition
for
rehearing,
i
don't
mean
to
draw
anything
here
unfavorable
inferences
and
i
just
want
to
know
this.
was
it
ever
suggested
in
view
of
the
construction
of
the
court
of
appeals
gave
that
one
had
better
find
out
what
alabama
supreme
court
gives?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
--
because
it's
--
i'll
tell
you
why
there's
such
(inaudible).
assume
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
under
construction
of
the
statute
as
you
will
arrive
again
next
year,
wouldn't
it?
is
the
ordinance
still
enforced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
alabama
supreme
court
wouldn't
be
bound
by
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
alabama
supreme
court
makes
next
year
may
find,
they
conclude
the
judge
rives
is
right
in
construing
that
ordinance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
giving
--
my
question
isn't
implied
any
weight
either
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
doesn't
tell
me
at
least,
maybe
it
tells
it
to
others
what
the
ordinance
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
beggs,
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
ordinance
that
held
by
a
state
court
to
have
exceeded
the
enabling
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
that
may
mean
that
for
the
first
year
you
go
free.
