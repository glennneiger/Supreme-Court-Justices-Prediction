the
difference
between
this
i
gather
and
in
sale
a
coal,
is
that
the
coal
is
a
tangible
thing,
if
it
were
to
come
there
and
the
company
held
it
in
its
place
and
some
local
broker
acted
as
salesman,
you
would
say
that
the
city
could
collect
the
tax
for
the
sale
of
the
coal
and
as
i
gather,
you're
arguing
the

thing
about

are

well,
i
suppose,
wouldn't
we,
we
would
have
that
question
before
us
not
in
theory

in
fact
that
mobile
had
tried

do
that?
justice

(voice

may
i
ask
you
how
you
can
rely
on
the
provision
which
says
that
the
tax
must
be
paid
as
a
prerequisite
for
doing

at

rely

through
what?
justice
hugo

why
was
it
an
omission?
justice
hugo

black
(voice

the
law
which
prescribes
that
company
that's
going
to
do
business
to
gas
company
for
a
year
and
the
next
year,
it's
based
on
the
gross
tax,
which
certainly
is
not
consistent
with
saying
that
the
law
at
the
same
time
means
that
they
got
to
pay
the
tax
as
a
prerequisite
for
doing
business.

justice

let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
a
few
weeks
ago,
this
court
had
a
case,
as
i
recall
it
from
connecticut,
maybe
weeks
or
months,
in
which
there
was
no
indication
that
the
statute
in
that
state
has
ever
been
enforced.
you
have
here
statute
which
you
say
might
bar
united
which
comes
here
and
said
that
it's
not
--
it's
got
no
object
to
pay
any
tax,
it
might
bar
them
from
doing
an
interstate
business.
have
you
any
idea
or
do
you
have
any
information
of
any
sorts
of
any
kind
that
mobile
either
has
in
the
past
or
has
threatened
to
enforce
in
a
such
statute
against
the
person
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
as
a
condition
of
such
doing
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
city
attorney
has
signed
a
brief
here
which
indicates
there's
no
such
law
in
effect.
what
have
you
to
say
with
reference
to
his
statement
of
that
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
if
we're
passing
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
cities
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
state
law,
the
effectiveness
of
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
assume
that
all
we
track
it
down
on
the
well-recognized
rules,
we
should
be
pretty
sure
what
weâ€˜re
doing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
these
distinctions
also
apply
so
far
as
the
sales
to
the
individual
consumers
are
concerned,
which
you
just
referred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
right,
it's
broken
into
smaller
parts
that
it
violates
the
constitution.
does
that
justify
the
city
in
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
the
consumers,
these
small
consumers
have
that,
the
burden
of
this
if
the
others
don't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
why
--
if
it
is
the
same
--
you're
basing
it
on
the
same
movement,
you
say
but
you
split
it
up
into
parts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
difficult
time
in
drawing
a
distinction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
does
the
movement
of
the
wholesale
company
in?
what
is
the
movement
in
of
the
gas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
movement
--
what
is
the
movement
of
the
gas
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
if
you
base
it
on
movement
alone,
the
situation
is
the
same.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
base
it
on
that
alone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
beginning
at
--
beginning
with
what
date,
mr.
white?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
should
begin
from
the
last
--
last
opinion
of
the
court
on
rehearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
(voice
overlap)
court
wants
to
disagree
with
you
and
think
it
when
the
court
takes
up
a
matter
for
rehearing
and
writes
its
opinion
on
it,
it
begins
in,
when
would
it
be
out
of
time?
would
it
be
in
time
or
out
of
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
(voice
overlap)
you
did
not
make
a
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
court
takes
jurisdiction
of
the
motion
for
rehearing,
considers
it
and
writes
an
opinion
on
it,
that
here
what
you
did,
you
say
that
that
wouldn't
be
the
judgment
which
was
appealable?
justice
hugo

so
