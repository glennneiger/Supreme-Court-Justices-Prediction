mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
presents
a
question
of
whether
the
commerce
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
denies
a
municipality
the
right
to
tax
the
direct
sale
of
natural
gas
to
industrial
consumers
within
the
city.
the
seller
being,
an
interstate
pipeline
company,
but
the
seller
itself
making
the
deliveries
direct
to
the
plant
of
the
purchaser
and
admittedly
the
situs
of
the
sale
lying
within
the
city
levying
the
tax.
the
appellate,
united
gas
pipeline
company
occupies
here
the
unique
position
of
a
taxpayer
arguing
for
the
validity
of
a
tax
levied
upon
it
rather
than
against
the
validity
of
the
tax.
that
situation
is
brought
about
by
the
fact
that
united
gas
paid
the
city
of
mobile,
the
taxes
for
the
three
years
in
question
and
then
sued
two
of
its
industrial
customers
to
whom
these
direct
deliveries
are
made
for
their
contractual
reimbursement.
under
thef
contract,
customers
were
obligated
to
reimburse
to
united
in
his
subsequent
levied
sales,
occupation,
privilege
or
the
types
of
taxes
and
this
tax
was
subsequently
levied
and
the
liability
of
the
appellees
to
united
gas
is
admitted
save
only
on
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
tax.
the
case
was
litigated
in
the
district
court
solely
on
the
question
of
whether
the
commerce
clause
was
infringed
upon
by
the
levy
of
this
direct
tax.
the
district
court
held
that
the
delivery
to
the
--
directly
to
the
consumer
on
the
sale
completed
within
the
city
of
mobile
was
separable
from
commerce
and
sustained
the
tax.
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
view
that
the
tax
on
the
privilege
of
selling
within
the
city
of
mobile
was
the
equivalent
of
a
tax
on
the
preceding
interstate
transportation
and
struck
the
tax
down
as
an
improper
burden
upon
interstate
commerce.
mr.
e.

i
suppose,
your
honor,
a
part
of
the
inseparable
from
commerce.

the

which
has
no

at
the
time
of
this
litigation,
seven
of
those
industries
were
within
the
city
of
mobile
or
its
police
jurisdiction.
the
two
northern
most
industries
were
outside
of
that
jurisdiction
and
therefore
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
alabama
power
and
international
paper
were
the
two
--
were
already
involved
at
that
time
your
honor.
now,
the
history
of
the
direct
sales
is
this.
prior
to
1954,
these
industries
purchased
their
gas
requirements
from
the
local
distributor,
mobile
gas
service
corporation.
because
of
the
rate
problems,
rates
--
those
rates
being
subject
to
administration
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
order
to
assure
a
more
stable
price,
the
industries
negotiated
with
united
gas
for
direct
purchases.
under
the
national
gas
act,
sales
for
resale,
that
is
sales
to
the
local
distributor
was
subject
to
the
federal
power
whereas
direct
sales
to
the
ultimate
consumer
are
not
so
subject.
and
so
in
1954,
all
seven
of
these
industrial
contracts
were
assigned
by
the
local
distributor,
mobile
gas
service
corporation
to
united
gas
pipeline
company.
united
gas
immediately
contracted
with
the
local
distributor
to
continue
to
make
the
distribution
through
their
local
distribution
system,
to
read
the
meters,
to
do
the
accounting,
to
send
the
bills
and
to
collect
for
the
gas.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
no
sir.
they're
taxed
under
the
statute
now
on
the
local
consumers,
mobile
gas
service
corporation
distributes
to
all
of
the
commercial
and
industrial
consumers
in
the
city.
and
they
pay
this
3%
tax
on
40,000
to
50,000
consumers
of
theirs.
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
united
gas
pays
no
tax
on
its
sales
for
resale
to
the
local
distributor
but
the
local
distributor
has
paid
the
tax.
if
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
upheld,
united
gas
will
be
in
the
position
of
being
able
to
make
direct
sales
to
consumers,
free
of
any
tax.
the
absurdity
we
submit,
as
we
conceive
of
that
the
position
is
that
if
that's
true
as
to
seven
industries,
why
not
ten,
why
not
2,
why
not
all
50,000
customers
within
the
city
of
mobile?
they'd
like
all
be
assigned
from
the
indirect
purchase
to
the
local
distributor
over
to
direct
purchases
from
united
gas
pipeline
company
and
escape
entirely
the
3%
of
sales
tax
if
it
be
that
the
sale
and
the
distribution
within
the
city
of
mobile
to
the
direct
consumer
is
to
be
exempted
from
the
tax.
your
honors
would
observe
that
from
this
--
following
this
paper
transfer
in
1954,
the
local
customers
who
would
--
the
industrial
consumers
whose
purchases
from
the
local
distributor
would
have
unquestionably
been
subject
to
the
tax,
but
who
would
like
to
escape
the
tax
since
they
buy
from
united
direct
rather
from
--
rather
from
the
local
distributor.
your
honors
would
observe
that
they
still
get
their
gas
through
the
same
pipes.
it's
read
through
the
same
meters.
it's
service
by
the
same
crews.
the
accounting
is
kept
right
in
the
same
office
in
mobile.
the
bills
go
out
from
the
mobile
office.
the
checks
in
payment
go
back
to
the
mobile
office
and
then
back
to
the
mobile
bank.
so
the
whole
transaction
is
consummated
within
the
city.
there's
no
dispute
and
it
is
conceded
that
the
size
of
the
sale
is
within
the
city
of
mobile.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
but
--
prior
to
the
1954
transfer
of
this
tax,
as
i've
already
said,
it
was
not
even
authorized
at
that
time.
this
tax
was
levied
from
the
first
time
in
1956.
the
local
distributor
has
not
contested
and
he
pays
it
and
of
course
either
directly
or
indirectly,
passes
it
on
to
his
customers,
and
united
gas
paid
it
for
the
three
years
in
question
and
two
of
the
industries
denied
the
obligation
to
reimburse.
not
because
the
contract
doesn't
require
it,
if
it
is
a
valid
tax,
they
defend
it
solely
on
the
validity
of
the
tax.
we
should
point
out
that
the
only
tax
reach
that
the
city
of
mobile
undertakes
to
make
against
united
and
that
united
disputes,
is
on
these
sales
direct
to
the
consumer.
united
transports
into
the
city
of
mobile
vast
quantities
of
gas,
free
of
this
tax
because
it
is
sold
at
wholesale
for
resale
by
the
local
distributor
and
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
sale
for
resale
is
that
--
that
interstate
commerce
but
the
sale
of
the
direct
consumer
is
not.
likewise,
united
transports
through
the
city
of
mobile's
police
jurisdiction
free
of
any
tax,
vast
quantities
of
gas
destined
for
the
pepsi
cola
and
northwest
florida
area.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
united
gas,
no
sir,
no
physical
change
at
all,
but
there's
only
a
paper
change.
it
did
give
a
greatest
stability
to
prices
and
that
--
but
the
physical
change
--
is
exactly
the
same
meters,
the
same
crews,
the
same
office,
the
same
pipes,
the
same
procedure.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
exactly
and
the
same
source
all
gas
for
the
mobile
area
comes
from
the
united
gas
pipeline
company.
no
--
no
physical
change
or
whatever.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
so
far
is
that
--
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
well,
i
don't
need
mean
to
--
suggest
that
it's
not
a
perfectly
legitimate
change
but
as
far
--
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
they
contracted
with
united
and
said,
“we'll
do
the
same
servicing
as
your
agent,
we
formerly
did
when
we're
going
to
sell
it.”
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes,
sir.
the
supreme
court
--
what
it
stated
is
this
that
during
the
time
of
this
litigation,
the
sales
price
from
united
to
these
industries
was
$0.23
per
thousand
cubic
feet.
their
agreement
with
mobile
gas
was
to
pay
them
$0.02
per
thousand
cubic
feet
for
doing
the
local
distributing
and
reading
the
meters
and
keeping
the
accounts
and
collecting
the
bills.
in
actual
practice,
the
$0.23
is
paid
to
the
mobile
gas
office
in
mobile
as
the
agent
of
united
in
trust
account.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
none,
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
none
whatsoever.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
none
at
all.
it
never
has
been.
it's
--
it's
simple
a
local
distributor
who
purchase
a
gas
requirements
in
wholesale.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
your
honor,
the
tax
here
levied
is
not
on
the
gas
or
movement
of
the
gas,
but
it
is
on
the
local
privilege
of
selling.
now,
the
sale
itself
is
a
transaction
consummated
within
the
city.
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases
that
the
sale
and
distribution
direct
to
the
local
consumer
is
a
local
interest,
separable
from
commerce
and
the
burden
if
any
that
holds
on
commerce
is
inconsequential,
the
local
interested
being
paramount.
the
court
has
held
in
three
cases
that
the
section
for
sale
to
subject
to
state
taxation
because
it
is
the
local
activity
of
selling.
it's
comparable
to
your
holdings
and
general
commodity
cases
where
you
have
held
that
the
state
in
which
the
sale
is
consummated
may
levy
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
that
sale.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes
sir
the
transfer
of
possession
was
the
answer
in
support
in
the
tax.
for
example
in
mcgoldrick
versus
--
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
i
was
under
the
impression
that
until
--
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
it
depends
on
what
the
tax
--
taxable
entities
your
honor
and
may
i
read
from
the
ordinance,
“each
person
--”
this
is
page
84
of
the
record
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
misconstrued
the
tax
ordinance
and
--
and
felt
that
it
was
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
delivery
that
thing
and
speaks
always
of
delivering.
they
never
get
around
to
the
privilege
of
selling.
now,
the
burden
of
the
tax
is,
“that
each
person,
firm
or
corporation
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
or
distributing
natural
gas,
in
an
amount
of
3%
of
the
gross
receipts
from
the
business
transacted
by
such
client
in
the
city
of
mobile”
for
the
preceding
year
of
such
natural
gas
sold
or
distributed
from
point
or
points
in
the
city
of
mobile.
now,
the
court
has
held
that
where
the
gas
is
purchased
as
it
is
consumed
and
it
is
--
that
it's
purchased
at
the
burner
tips,
the
sale
takes
place
at
the
burner
tips.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
if
the
tax
your
honor
--
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
well,
if
time
permits,
i
would
like
to
discuss
some
of
the
brief
--
some
of
the
cases
that
are
in
the
brief
where
i
believe
just
that
has
been
held
that
the
state
where
the
transaction
comes
to
fruition
is
conferred
the
benefits
and
he's
entitled
to
tax
whether
it'd
be
a
gross
receipts
tax
or
other
form
of
tax.
let
me
point
out
here
that
none
of
the
usual
grounds
upon
which
a
--
an
alleged
tax
on
interstate
commerce
is
--
may
sometimes
be
stricken
down
exist.
there's
no
claim
here
that
the
tax
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce.
the
same
tax
applies
to
the
local
distributor
and
it
is
paid
without
question.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
it
with
respect
to
the
two
sets
part
of
the
purchase
price
that
the
local
distributor
retains
on
second
re-hearing.
just
how
to
--
to
justify
taxing
$0.02
out
of
the
$0.23
when
it's
all
part
and
posture
between
transactions,
we've
been
on
unable
to
find.
but
with
those
who
do
all
of
their
purchasing
from
the
local
distributor,
the
--
the
--
the
tax
is
paid
and
all
passed
on
to
all
consumers
so
we
have
here
seven
consumers
who
were
excluded
from
the
tax
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
result
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
discrimination
in
reverse.
it
says
that
any
interstate
seller
who
brings
his
commodity
in
interstate
but
himself
makes
a
delivery
and
collects
the
purchase
price
right
within
the
city
shall
be
immune
from
the
tax.
i
say
the
--
the
all
50,000
or
so
of
the
local
consu
--
local
consumers
of
gas
could
just
well
be
transferred
over
the
united
gas
and
skip
this
tax
entirely.
the
rule
is
the
same
in
power
cases
as
this
court
has
held,
why
not
let
the
power
companies
make
that
same
indirect
escape
with
the
tax.
i
mean
if
it's
true
for
the
city
of
mobile,
it
would
be
true
for
municipalities
and
state
taxes
throughout
the
country.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
your
honor
i
think
so.
you
will
characterize
the
interstate
sale
of
--
of
gas
direct
to
the
consumer
as
interstate
and
i
think
as
long
as
the
transportation
is
in
progress,
it
is
interstate
movement.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
i
agree
that
it
was
--
its
movement
was
interstate.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
he
held
it
that
--
that
the
tax
was
on
the
movement
your
honor.
he
never
reached
--
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
the
movement,
but
your
honor
it's
the
movement
that
is
taxed.
it's
the
sale
that
is
taxed.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
the
movement
your
honor,
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
i
agree
that
the
movement
was
but
i
agree
if
that
is
not
the
event
that
was
taxed.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
they
taxed
the
privilege
of
making
a
local
sale
your
honor.
the
umbrella
that
the
commerce
clause
throws
over
the
interstate
transportation
should
not
extend
to
the
things
that
are
done
with
the
commerce
after
it
arrives.
for
example,
in
the
mcgoldrick
versus
berwind-white,
their
coal
was
barged
interstate
from
the
mines
in
the
outside
state
directly
to
the
plant
site.
the
court
upheld
a
sales
tax.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
because
the
court
said
that
the
delivery
of
possession
to
the
consumer
was
at
its
plant
site
which
was
is
in
new
york
city.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
but
there
was
no
further
transportation,
your
honor.
the
local
commerce,
the
sale
began
but
--
but
we've
forgot
to
make
the
distinction
between
transportation
and
commerce.
i
agree
that
transportation
as
long
as
it
was
flowing
was
commerce,
but
when
it
comes
to
the
local
sale
and
consumption,
the
transportation
is
ended
and
the
local
event
has
taken
place.
in
the
indiana
cases
that
came,
the
court
pointed
out
that
true
mcgoldrick
involved
the
sales
tax
but
the
same
tax
on
the
seller
applies
and
the
tax
was
upheld
in
the
national
harvester
case
on
two
types
of
sales.
one,
where
the
purchaser
came
in
and
says
--
from
out
of
state
and
says,
“i
want
to
buy
this
tractor
and
take
it
to
florida.”
admittedly
it
is
commerce,
but
he
made
the
sale
and
ended
commerce,
second,
where
the
tractor
was
shipped
into
the
state
and
delivered
in
to
the
purchaser
at
the
end
of
its
journey,
the
delivery
of
possession.
now
we
have
a
transfer
delivery
of
possession
when
it
passes
through
our
meter
to
their
burner
and
it's
consumed.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes
sir
and
it
points
the
--
what
we
conceive
to
be
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
that's
on
page
128
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
throughout
treated
the
tax
as
a
tax
on
delivery.
it
expressly
disavows
that
it
is
a
tax
on
sales.
it
says
that
the
city
would
have
the
right
to
tax
sales,
but
it
didn't
choose
to
tax
sales.
it
choose
to
tax
deliveries
according
to
court
of
appeals,
but
the
clear
reading
of
the
ordinance,
discloses
that
all
it
did
tax
is
a
sale.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes.
and
if
that
be
true
your
honor,
our
case
fails,
but
it
isn't
what
the
ordinance
levies
the
tax
on.
the
tax
is
levied
on
the
sale,
the
privilege
of
making
the
sale
and
it
was
the
inability
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
catch
that
distinction
which
is
well
summarized
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
that
caused
the
reversal.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
i
agree
your
honor
they
do
not
have
the
right
to
levied
on
the
privilege
of
commerce,
but
the
commerce
umbrella
does
not
give
to
the
out-of-state
seller,
the
right
to
come
within
the
city
and
complete
a
local
sale.
you
see,
there's
no
segregation
of
this
gas
at
any
point
until
it
is
full
by
fortuitous
circumstance
for
this
particular
plant.
mrs.
jones
could
just
well
pull
it
to
fry
her
husband
eggs
that
morning
fur
--
further
up
the
line.
it's
a
non-segregated
commodity
until
it
is
purchased
for
the
commodity
that
united
gas
has
within
the
city.
and
the
--
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
the
dis
--
difference
of
the
physical
property
is
ought
not
to
produce
a
different
result
and
has
not
in
this
court.
in
three
different
cases,
the
court
has
held
that
fact
of
the
local
sale
by
the
interstate
pipeline
company,
the
one
who
brought
it
in
is
sufficient
support
to
tax
and
in
the
other
cases
--
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
oh
sir,
a
local.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
no
sir,
no.
it's
--
it's
the
interstate
shipper
who
brought
it
in
and
sold
it
just
as
in
the
other
cases.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
he
sells
to
his
--
all
the
other
customers
in
the
city
except
these
seven.
we
took
over
these
seven
and
sell
them
in
direct
and
if
that
device
permits
us
to
escape
attack,
we
might
take
over
the
rest
of
the
customers.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
that's
true.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
answering
the
quantitative
distinction
question
that
was
asked
upon
which
mr.
white
undertook
to
make
a
distinction.
that
question
has
been
passed
on
by
this
court
itself
in
one
of
the
early
cases
in
pennsylvania
gas
company
versus
public
service
commission.
the
court
held
that
the
pipeline
company
that
pipes
the
gas
into
the
state
and
sold
it
to
residences
and
factories
within
the
state
was
subject
to
state
regulation
because
the
business
was
local
in
character.
in
the
subsequent
case
of
panhandle
eastern
pipeline
company,
the
pipeline
company
sought
to
exclude
its
large
bulk
sales
to
anchor
hocking
or
very
large
industry
on
the
theory
that
the
pennsylvania
gas
case
made
local
only
the
small
sales,
but
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
opinion
in
the
pennsylvania
gas
case
that
requires
it
--
does
not
require
to
be
so
limited.
on
the
contrary,
emphasis
may
rather
be
placed
on
effect
that
both
situations
involved
sales
to
ultimate
consumers.
anchor
hocking
being
just
as
clearly
in
that
category
is
that
factories
and
residences
served
in
the
--
in
the
pennsylvania
gas
case.
both
involved
gas
sold
to
the
ultimate
consumers
so
that
the
quantitative
test
has
already
been
before
the
court
and
the
test
is,
if
the
transaction
is
a
sale
to
the
ultimate
consumer,
it's
local
in
character
and
is
subject
to
both
the
state
--
state
power
to
regulate
and
the
state
power
to
tax.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
--
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
no,
no.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
the
interstate
carrier
may
sell
his
own
commodity.
but
when
he
sells
this
commodity,
at
the
end
of
--
at
the
end
of
interstate
hall,
he
has
become
subject
to
local
law.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
may
i
make
this
distinction
your
honor?
if
united
--
if
united
was
transporting
the
gas
of
abc
gas
company
for
half,
spector
motor
company
was
holding
free
then
the
whole
transaction
would
be
interstate
commerce.
the
movement
was
a
pick
it
up
in
texas
and
then
putting
down
in
alabama.
that
part
is
free
of
any
tax
and
we
put
in
--
there
has
been
no
effort
tax
at
all
but
the
court
of
appeal
seems
to
think
there
has.
but
what
united
pipeline
did
was
got
owner
to
bring
in
the
commodity
but
it
owned
the
commodity
and
at
the
end
of
the
journey
it
says,
now
having
brought
here,
we've
got
the
right
to
sell
free
of
any
tax.
so
there's
the
distinction
but
spector
motor
service
says,
the
carrier
that
picks
up
and
puts
down
for
hire,
the
commodity
of
the
third
party,
sure
its
interstate
commerce
from
picking
up
to
the
putting
down
but
where
the
carrier
owns
the
commodity
and
he
tries
to
stretch
the
umbrella
out
over
the
sale
at
the
end,
he's
invaded
the
local
field
and
it's
subject
to
local
regulations.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
they
paid
out
your
honor.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
they
paid
out.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
it's
out,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
i
believe
you
follow
the
state
decision,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
no
sir,
i'd
like
--
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
no
sir.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
may
i
make
two
answers?
i
called
the
court's
attention
that
the
alabama
district
judge
and
alabama
lawyer,
judge
rives
also
is
an
alabama
lawyer
but
judge
thomas
is
there
pressing
in
the
alabama
law
upheld
the
order.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
he
construed
it.
so
if
weight
is
to
be
given
to
a
lower
court
construction,
i
don't
know
which
i
have
to
agree
with.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
now,
the
second
answering
it
another
way,
what
has
been
overlooked
so
far
by
mr.
white
hasn't
been
called
to
the
court's
attention
in
this
construction
of
the
statute
is
the
backing
up
state
statute
which
authorizes
city
ordinance.
that
is
found
in
appendix
b
on
our
main
brief.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
it
does
make
clear
though
your
honor
that
the
tax
is
limited
to
sales
and
it's
not
on
transportation
and
it's
also
makes
clear
that
the
tax
is
only
on
the
sales
of
the
previous
year
and
that
--
that
state
enabling
act
has
been
before
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
held
that
where
an
utility
was
purchased
by
a
new
purchaser,
it
cannot
be
taxed
on
the
sales
of
the
seller
in
the
previous
year.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
but
to
remedy
that,
the
legislation
then
added
a
cause
that's
in
here
now
but
it
wasn't
there
at
that
time.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
i
agree
that
this
precise
point
is
not
the
best
part.
i
wanted
to
answer
though
the
questions
of
why
there
is
nothing
in
the
city
ordinance
that
taxes
on
current
year
sales
or
requires
a
minimum
tax
at
the
outset.
to
have
done
either
would
have
exceeded
the
enabling
act
to
the
state
legislature.
that
provision
in
section
15
it
says
that
you
can
have
60
days
free
and
then
pay
based
on
current
year
sales
hasn't
an
application
here.
the
state
statute
says
only
sales
of
the
previous
year
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
ruled
that
it
means
just
that.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes.
right,
that's
the
effect
of
them.
that's
all
we've
argued
in
any
of
the
courts.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
last
year
that
we
paid
in
1958
was
something
over
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
on
these
two
industries,
alone
i
believe.
my
figures
are
vague
in
my
mind
now
your
honor.
the
total
of
the
tax
is
about
one-third
of
the
mobile
--
city
of
mobile
revenue
but
that
involves
the
purchases
from
the
local
distributors.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes
sir
and
former
state
secretary.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
i'm
sure
their
heart
is
any
more
than
rest
of
us.
we
paid
out
dollars
and
we
feel
we're
entitled
for
reimbursement
and
that
must
be
fair
with
our
other
customers.
mr.
e.
dixie
beggs
yes
sir.
i
would
like
also
to
point
out
that
the
state
of
alabama
supreme
court
has
passed
on
similar
state
enactments
and
in
southern
natural
gas
which
came
to
this
court,
the
tax
was
upheld
because
there
were
sales
direct
to
industries
there.
in
the
other
two
appearances
of
similar
tax
cases
before
the
alabama
supreme
court,
they
held
that
interstate
commerce
was
involved
because
the
only
sales
was
sales
for
resale
to
the
local
distributor.
but
in
southern
natural
gas
case,
we
had
a
--
a
factual
situation
quite
comparable
to
this
to
where
the
sales
where
there
are
six
to
seven
subsidiaries
of
the
tennessee
court
of
iron
company
and
the
state
graduated
franchise
tax
was
upheld
because
that
was
found
to
be
a
local
business.
and
this
court
said
again
upholding
the
tax
which
had
been
ties
through
upon
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
said,
“we
had
occasion
in
east
ohio
gas
company
to
consider
the
distinction
between
the
transportation
of
gas
into
a
state
and
the
furnishing
of
gas
so
transported
to
consumers
within
the
state.”
that
is
the
distinction
which
makes
this
tax
on
the
privilege
of
furnishing
it
to
the
consumer
who
buys
at
his
burner
tips,
who
pays
for
it
and
the
city
where
he
does
the
consuming.
he
gets
it
under
the
streets
of
the
city,
under
the
police
protection
of
the
city.
that
makes
this
the
local
event
that
is
separable
from
commerce,
the
sale
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
the
interstate
transportation
is
over.
there's
been
a
transfer
of
possession,
the
transfer
of
title.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
