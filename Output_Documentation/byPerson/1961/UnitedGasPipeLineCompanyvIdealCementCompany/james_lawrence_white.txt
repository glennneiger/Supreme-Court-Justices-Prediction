mr.
james
lawrence
white
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
can
come
to
grips
immediately
with
the
problem
that
appears
to
bother
the
court
and
state
--
i
can
state
unequivocally
and
possibly
understandably
that
we
contend
the
court
was
exactly
right
in
its
analysis
of
this
ordinance.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
it
is
quite
evident
from
the
reading
of
the
ordinance
itself
and
that
--
that
it
is
broader
than
one
that
imposes
a
tax
based
on
the
sales
measured
by
gross
receipts
which
from
hearing
the
argument
from
my
opponents
this
morning
and
browsing
their
briefs,
i
take
to
be
their
fundamental
argument.
i
submit
that
if
you
turn
to
the
ordinance,
which
begins
at
80
--
page
83
of
this
record,
it
is
an
outright
requirement
that
one
must
satisfy
the
condition
set
forth
therein
to
conduct
a
business
of
any
nature
it
said
so
on
page
83
under
a
sub-arabic
2
and
they
say
that
--
reading
the
introduction
first,
we're
paraphrasing,
“the
following
is
hereby
declared
to
be
the
schedule
of
licenses
for
the
year
beginning
january
1,
1955
and
so
on,
then
it
says,
for
keeping,
engaging
and/or
carrying
on
a
business
of
any
nature
offering
merchandize
for
sale,
soliciting
orders
or
making
deliveries
of
any
merchandise
and
so
on.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
quite
evident
from
this
that
we
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
ordinance
to
have
it
apply
to
every
person
whatever
located,
if
he's
engaged
in
or
doing
any
of
the
acts
there
specified.
now,
appellant
would
have
us
adhere
or
attend
only
to
section
193
of
that
ordinance
which
appears
after
omissions
on
page
84
of
the
record.
there
true
enough,
they
deal
with
gas
companies,
but
in
dealing
with
gas
companies,
they
deal
with
them
for
the
purpose
of
setting
forth
what
the
exaction
well
be
from
it
--
from
gas
companies.
i
do
not
think
that
it
can
be
reasonably
contended
that
all
that
goes
before
this
exaction
provision
or
the
measurement
on
the
gross
receipts
is
a
nullity
and
doesn't
mean
anything.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
mr.
justice
black,
insofar
as
i
know
there's
been
no
compulsion
in
the
sense
that
processes
had
been
issued
or
anything
else.
insofar
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
i
am
not
familiar
with
alabama
law
and
all
of
its
detail
sir.
so
far
as
the
context
to
these
cases
are
concerned,
united
who
is
the
one
who
paid
the
taxes,
see,
we're
here
in
the
reimbursement
situation
for
the
tax
paid
as
mr.
beggs
pointed
out,
the
gas
company
is
trying
up
over
tax
on
the
gas
company.
it
was
voluntarily
paid
by
united
gas
pipeline
and
i
am
sure
that
there's
no
quarrel
that
that
is
the
fact
and
consequently,
we
find
ourselves
in
the
posture
of
in
effect
saying,
“united
you
did
the
wrong
thing.
you
paid
something
you
did
not
have
to
pay.”
mr.
james
lawrence
white
i
think
that
you
have
that
in
fact
why
--
this
case
--
you
could
make
short
trip
to
this
case
about
any
question
at
all
mr.
justice
black.
but
when
you
come
to
the
remedies,
now
it
contained
in
the
ordinance
of
self
it
first.
it
is
quite
evident
that
they're
serious
about
this
as
license
tax.
the
--
i
think
that
i
should
point
out
that
this
ordinance
and
the
thrust
is
to
the
business
of
any
nature
and
it
includes
making
deliveries
and
that
the
--
a
coverage
of
the
ordinance
is
all
inclusive
that
it
doesn't
single
out
any
local
incident
really
when
you
come
down
to
it,
when
you
talk
about
the
coverage
of
it,
because
there
it
pertains
to
any
business.
now,
if
only
sales
are
singled
out,
if
the
--
if
the
appellant
is
correct
that
what
they
tax
is
the
sale,
we
submit
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
that
a
tax
on
the
sale
really
can't
be
differentiated
from
a
direct
and
apportioned
tax
on
gross
receipts
which
this
court
i
think
has
rather
uniformly
disallowed.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well,
i
think
it
does
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes.
mr.
justice
harlan
and
i
think
that
has
particular
applicability
to
a
question
that
i
hope
to
reach
and
i
think
the
court
is
concerned
in
and
this
is
a
jurisdiction
on
appeal
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
and
--
and
justice
rives
so
treated
it
sir
--
judge
rives
in
the
court
below
so
treated
it
as
having
an
important
bearing
on
it.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well,
it
is
--
it
is
a
self-executing
completion
justice.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
but
it
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well
let
me
go
by
--
oh
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
of
the
launch
and
recess,
my
attention
had
been
directed
to
section
16
of
the
ordinance
and
perhaps
i
didn't
get
import
of
justice
harlan's
question
and
possibly
then
i
didn't
follow
the
logical
change
to
that
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
will
make
this
observation
in
that
section
16
that
it
seems
to
that
it
neither
adds
to
nor
detracts
from
the
ordinance
that
if
--
it
were
otherwise
in
conflict
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
presumably
of
the
constitution
of
alabama
where
then
you
would
have
it
invalid
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
so
provide
or
not.
justice
harlan,
i
don't
know
if
that
has
answered
your
question
or
not.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
oh
yes,
i
see.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
now,
treating
a
further
with
the
statute
as
a
whole,
i
say
that
this
is
a
licensing
ordinance
because
not
only
does
it
so
state
and
requires
outright
in
so
many
words,
a
license
to
conduct
any
business
of
any
nature
and
you
need
to
make
deliveries
and
to
enter
the
city
to
do
business.
i
think
that
this
concept
of
a
license
being
involved
here
is
further
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
the
tax
must
be
paid
before
engaging
in
business
as
i
see
it
under
section
18
of
the
ordinance
which
appears
on
page
--
record
page
85.
it
provides
rather
impressive
criminal
penalties
of
a
$100
fine
and
six
months
imprisonment.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
guess
i
have
the
wrong
page
reference
to
section
18.
yes,
it
begins
on
the
--
at
the
--
17.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
oh,
15,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
it
is
section
15.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes.
well
--
oh
no,
i'm
sorry
sir
it
is
section
19
and
section
20
containing
the
criminal
sanctions
and
they
appear
on
page
86.
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan,
thank
you.
there
is
a
provision
for
a
lien
on
the
property
of
the
offending
or
non-complying
business
and
that
i
believe
is
--
yes
it
is
set
forth
in
section
21
of
the
ordinance
on
page
86
and
as
was
mentioned
by
one
of
the
counsel
for
the
appellant
who
preceded
me,
there
are
provisions
for
injunctive
relief
under
the
organic
law
of
the
state
which
provides
for
--
or
is
the
enabling
legislation
for
a
city
to
enact
an
ordinance
of
this
type.
now,
this
license
i
think
also
could
be
construed
as
being
only
an
annual
license
or
in
other
words,
it
is
required
each
year
the
ordinance
so
states
in
its
very
introductory
sentence
on
page
83
of
the
record.
and
section
1
states
that
the
following
is
here
i
declare
to
be
and
it's
adopted
--
it's
a
schedule
licenses
for
the
year
beginning
january
1,
1955
and
for
each
subsequent
year,
the
license
is
payable,
is
due
on
january
1
of
each
year
and
that
is
set
forth
in
section
3
of
the
ordinance
which
appears
on
page
84
of
the
record
and
in
the
case
of
the
new
business
even
coming
into
the
town
as
set
forth
in
section
15
there's
a
sort
of
temporary
method
of
making
them
pay
for
the
license.
now
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
if
it
had
not
operated
previously,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
be
the
case
and
for
it
to
continue
to
operate
the
thrust
of
the
license
--
the
ordinance
is
such
that
it
must
pay
it.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
i
can
answer
as
to
gas
companies,
there's
no
other
thing
specified
otherwise
specified
as
to
whether
the
ordinance
in
all
of
its
at
least
more
than
193
sub-provisions
as
to
separate
businesses
so
specified
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
cannot
say.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well
i
think
it
was
argued,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
no,
i
was
not
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
if
we
have
a
standing
by
itself,
mr.
justice
harlan,
my
position
would
be
the
same
that
even
as
construed
by
appellant
that
this
is
not
a
gross
receipts
tax,
but
it
is
a
license
tax
on
sales
measured
by
gross
receipts.
i
think
that
whenever
you
equate
it
on
that
basis,
you
immediately
run
into
the
situation
or
the
concept
that
the
tax
on
the
sale
cannot
be
differentiated
from
directly
un-apportioned
tax
on
gross
receipts.
and
on
the
basis
of
the
panhandle
indiana
case
under
the
natural
gas
act
true
enough,
it
certainly
seems
clear
that
in
the
situation
like
this,
interstate
commerce
is
still
continuing
at
the
point
which
they
seek
to
reach
through
this
--
this
license
tax.
now,
if
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well
that
is
--
as
i
understand
it
mr.
justice
black,
that
is
the
situation
of
what
is
owed
by
a
company
that
has
have
the
past
experience
that
they
can
assess
the
license
tax
for
the
current
year
on
the
basis
of
what
they
have
done
the
previous
year.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
then,
as
i
understand
that
they
have
a
two
months
period
during
which
a
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
to
pick
up
the
--
i
believe
that
is
section
15
of
the
ordinance
on
page
84
and
85
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
15.
that's
84
and
85
begins
at
the
bottom
of
its
folio
122.
i
think
that
that
to
provides
for
the
situation
where
you
have
a
new
company
coming
into
the
city
of
mobile,
and
then
in
fact
saying
that
before
engaging
in
or
doing
the
business,
a
person,
firm
or
corporation
so
liable
or
applying
for
a
license
shall
pay
the
minimum
amount
prescribed.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
sir,
i
do
not
know
off
hand.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
specified
minimum
not
to
my
recollection.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
--
that
made
through
an
omission
be
the
case
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
i
say
that
may
through
an
omission
be
the
case.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well,
i
can't
say.
i'm
not
in
position
to
answer
the
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
i
think
that
certainly
in
that
event
mr.
justice
black,
they
would
have
to
pay
it
the
next
year
to
continue
doing
the
business
and
it
would
be
every
business
much
a
license
for
that
purpose
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well,
that
--
that
is
where
you
gain
the
minimum
experience
to
pay
the
minimum.
mr.
justice
black
sir
had
asked
me
what
was
the
minimum
regard
to
it
natural
gas
company
or
a
gas
company
here
and
i
was
not
in
position
to
answer
on
that
because
i
didn't
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
pardon
sir?
mr.
james
lawrence
white
i
do
not
see
it
here
and
i
candidly
so
state.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
is
--
that
is
the
way
the
general
idea
of
section
15
justice
black.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes.
and
i
think
that
in
dealing
in
services,
there
are
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
i
did
not
have
the
advantage
of
this
pamphlet
until
afternoon
recess
justice
brennan.
mr.
rhyne
was
kind
enough
to
give
it
to
me.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
it
--
it
may
be
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
mr.
chief
justice,
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
as
i
say,
i
did
not
have
the
ordinance
until
--
during
the
luncheon
recess.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes.
on
page
48,
they
specify
each
railroad
company
having
an
office
in
the
city
shall
pay
$2,000.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
$2,000.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
you
mean
it's
--
you
are
still
referring
to
gas
companies,
mr.
justice
frankfurter?
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
on
the
amount
of
the
sales
sir,
i'm
advised
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
electric
--
i'm
advised
the
electric
companies
come
under
that
category,
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
not
at
least
for
the
first
year
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
it
does.
it
provides
minimum
amount
but
i
mean
does
not
–-
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
can
certainly
appear
so
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
not
to
my
knowledge,
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
construe
section
19,
i
think
that
that
would
apply.
in
the
--
a
case
of
a
gas
company
in
the
city
of
mobile,
it
was
already
there
which
in
any
year
just
did
not
procure
its
license
and
pay
its
license
fee.
and
let's
assume
the
situation
which
presumably
would
be
the
situation
in
regard
to
united
gas
pipeline,
the
appellant
here.
it
has
been
in
mobile
--
have
been
doing
business
in
mobile
for
a
number
of
years.
it
has
the
basis
on
which
you
could
determine
what
it
owed
the
city
for
the
license.
if
it
beginning
for
example
in
the
year
1962,
just
decided
it
was
not
going
to
pay
then
i
would
say
it
would
be
in
the
situation
of
doing
the
business
without
having
first
to
obtained
the
license
and
would
be
subject
to
the
license
as
it
is
contemplated.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
appears
so
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
is
right.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
on
the
basis
of
what
we
know
sir,
it
could
--
it
could
get
by
free
for
a
year.
yes.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
is
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
i
have
known
not
such
knowledge.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well,
i
don't
understand
that
he
has
conceded
that
there's
a
law
in
effect
mr.
justice
black.
as
i
get
it,
they
have
said
that
they
would
withhold
their
hand
in
seeking
injunctive
relief
which
comes
under
the
alabama
organic
law
or
enabling
legislation,
but
i
do
not
understand
the
amicus
or
the
city
of
mobile
to
have
said
that
there
is
no
such
law
that
would
permit
the
enforcement.
now,
i
say
to
you
sir
that
i
know
of
no
threat
or
of
any
instance
of
using
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
of
the
injunction
or
the
criminal
penalties.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well,
i
think
sir
that
you
can
be
sure
on
what
you're
doing
when
you
have
something
that
is
so
obviously
intended
to
be
a
license
and
that
whether
or
not,
its
enforcement
has
been
threatened.
perhaps,
there's
been
no
need
to
threaten
enforcement
because
the
tax
has
been
paid.
that's
certainly
true
on
the
instances
before
us
here.
whether
it
is
going
to
be
dependent
upon,
whether
they
will
or
whether
they're
not,
whenever
they
presume
to
have
the
power
to
do
so,
i
think
the
fact
that
they
have
provided
themselves
with
the
power,
presume
to
have
the
power
to
do
so,
there
you
have
a
threat
to
interstate
commerce
which
the
commerce
clause
reaches.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well,
i
think
that
the
point
was
made
that
this
does
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
but
i
again
say
that
the
fact
that
there
is
no
discrimination
is
in
itself
determinant
of
the
fact
that
the
--
i
think
that
again,
and
i
believe
was
in
freeman
versus
(inaudible)
this
court
observed
that
it's
immaterial
that
local
commerce
is
subjected
to
a
similar
encumbrance
and
i
think
in
the
corollary
there
would
be
true
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
treated
alike
does
not
give
the
city
the
right
to
encumber
interstate
commerce.
i
would
–-
mr.
james
lawrence
white
quite
alright,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
i
think
that
quantitatively
you
can.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes.
it
is
that
--
well,
where
you
have
the
lar
--
movement
of
very
much
larger
volumes
of
gas
than
you
have
in
the
instances
of
where
you
serve
domestic
costumers,
you
have
the
situation
of
a
further
and
further
division
of
the
gas
into
smaller
and
smaller
packages
so
that
it
can
be
distributed
to
more
and
more
people
that
you
then
get
into
a
situation
of
where
you
are
occupying
streets
of
a
city
up
to
a
much
greater
extent.
you
get
into
a
situation
of
where
perhaps
the
--
there's
a
greater
regulation.
i
recognize
that
perhaps
the
mechanical
test
of
breaking
the
package
may
no
longer
be
of
a
particular
significance,
but
yet,
you
have
a
repeated
breaking
down
of
the
commodity
into
smaller
and
smaller
quantities.
here,
we
have
the
situation
of
where
the
only
function
of
the
local
distribution
company
is
to
serve
as
a
conduit
for
these
large
interstate
pipelines
gas
which
goes
in
large
volumes
to
the
seven
customers.
i
think
that
it
all
gets
to
be
perhaps
mr.
chief
justice,
a
matter
of
degree.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
and
--
but
when
you
come
to
the
small
householder
who
may
use
a
very,
very,
very
small
fraction
of
the
amount
in
the
whole
year
that
a
large
industry
may
use
in
a
few
hours,
i
think
you
have,
as
i
said,
recently,
a
quantitative
situation
which
i
think
would
have
an
effect
on
this
interstate
commerce
concept.
now,
aside
from
this
privilege
tax
concept,
it
seems
to
me,
if
the
court
please,
that
as
i
pointed
out
in
discussing
this
ordinance
generally,
this
ordinance,
the
thrust
of
it
while
it
may
say
at
is
to
the
sales
to
be
measured
by
gross
proceeds
that
--
to
say
that
that
makes
a
difference,
is
a
difference
without
any
distinction
whatsoever.
because,
if
they
do
in
fact
reach
the
gross
proceeds,
if
this
then
i
think
becomes
a
direct
tax,
we
don't
have
here
a
situation
of
where
they're
trying
to
reach
net
income,
we
don't
have
the
situation
wherein
the
city
is
trying
to
make
an
apportionment
so
as
to
make
this
tax
commensurate
with
the
local
--
the
relative
local
activity
that
is
involved,
i
submit
your
honors
that
we
held
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes.
i
would
say
that
there
in
a
maybe
more
abstracts
since
you
have
a
continuation
of
interstate
commerce,
but
it
gets
broken
down
into
smaller
and
smaller
package.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
it
would.
i
think
it
does
have
an
important
bearing
upon
it
because
i
don't
think
that
you
can
divorce
interstate
commerce
in
all
instances
from
physics
that
you
have
problems
in
a
very
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
know
if
they
do.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well
now
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well,
i'll
take
it
then
when
you
asked
me
the
question
originally,
you
related
it
to
this
same
pipeline
company
making
the
same
delivery.
the
actual
fact
is
that
in
the
city
of
mobile,
the
gas
which
is
sold
by
--
it's
sold
too
to
small
domestic
customer
is
sold
by
the
local
distributing
company
and
the
local
distributing
company
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
the
movement
by
the
wholesale
company
on
the
sale
to
the
domestic
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
the
movement
of
the
gas
in
sir,
when
it
is
consumed.
when
it
is
burned,
when
it
is
used
for
its
inherent
physical
property
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
lawrence
white
it
moves
to
clear
to
the
burner
tip
in
either
event.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
if
it
were
dependent
on
that
alone.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
there
have
been
state
decisions
mr.
justice
harlan
on
--
as
the
state
franchise
tax
which
i
frankly
must
state
i
don't
believe
lends
any
light
on
this.
there
are
state
franchise
taxes
and
if
--
the
state
taxes
it
on
an
entirely
different
basis.
there
was
one
case.
i
do
not
have
it
at
hand
now.
i
discarded
it
mainly
because
i
thought
it
had
really
no
relationship
to
this
which
involved
transcontinental
gas
pipeline
company
and
another
which
involved
a
transportation
by
a
--
or
products,
oil
products
transported
and
my
recollection
is
that
in
both
instances,
the
state
struck
down
the
franchise
tax
because
interstate
commerce
was
involved.
but
it
was
not
a
situation
--
it
was
a
franchise
tax,
straight
out
franchise
tax.
i
have
averted
to
the
fact
that
i
think
that
we
cannot
say
that
there
--
that
this
is
not
also
a
gross
receipts
tax
and
accordingly,
it
would
be
defective
for
that
reason.
the
court
had
reserved
the
question
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case
until
argument
on
the
merits
and
we
have,
if
your
honors
please,
indicated
two
possible
jurisdictional
deficiencies
in
this
case
so
far
as
the
appeal
is
concerned.
one
is,
that
whether
the
appeal
--
appeal
has
been
out
of
time
because
of
the
history
of
this
case
below
where
we
had
two
petitions
for
rehearing
and
whether
--
and
we
submit
that
on
the
question
of
timeliness
of
the
appeal,
it
is
simply
dependent
upon
what
the
court
below
did
the
second
time
because
if
the
court
did
enter
a
judgment
at
that
time
or
an
order
which
would
be
the
beginning
of
the
juris
--
running
of
a
jurisdictional
time
admittedly
they
are
on
time
otherwise,
they
would
be
out
of
time.
the
other
question
on
jurisdiction
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes,
certainly
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
they
would
have
been
out
of
time
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
yes
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
clearly
out
of
time
by
over
a
hundred
days,
i
believe.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
if
they
constitute
such
a
change
by
the
court
of
its
--
either
its
original
judgment
and
opinion
or
the
timely
petition
for
rehearing,
i
would
say
that
they
would
apparently
be
in
time.
if
the
court,
on
the
other
hand,
by
the
second
opinion
on
rehearing
did
not
alter
its
previous
holdings
and
merely
restated
them,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
appeal
has
been
filed
out
of
time.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
would
be
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
is
my
contention,
sir.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
it
was
be
more
out
of
time
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
--
by
--
the
notice
of
appeal
mr.
justice
harlan
was
filed
on
january
25th,
1961
and
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
february
13,
1961
so
it
would
be
even
more
out
of
time.
the
other
point
on
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
well,
it
depends
--
it
depends
on
what
date
we
start
from
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
no,
my
--
i
have
begun
from
the
denial
of
the
court
–-
mr.
james
lawrence
white
it
would
be
out
of
time
if
you
consider
the
first
order
of
the
court
below
on
rehearing,
it
would
be
in
time
if
you
consider
the
second
order
of
the
court
on
rehearing.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
and
neither
can
i,
justice
frankfurter
and
that's
why
i
raised
the
point.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
i
would
say
that
that
--
it
wouldn't
not
be
the
judgment
that
for
no
other
reason
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
--
invoking
the
policy
that
litigation
must
have
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
lawrence
white
thank
you
sir,
i
have.
the
other
point
on
jurisdiction
was
whether
the
court
below
had
actually
declared
this
city
ordinance
upon
which
appellants
were
dependent
to
be
repugnant
to
the
constitution.
certainly,
it
drew
it
in
the
question.
there's
no
question
about
that,
and
it
determined
as
a
part
of
its
rationale
that
it
would
offend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
but
the
thing
that
--
my
concern
the
court
from
the
jurisdictional
standpoint
is
that
the
court
then
said
this
isn't
unconstitutional
as
a
whole
that
the
--
i
am
going
to
use
the
savings
clause
of
this
to
save
it
from
unconstitutionality,
therefore
that
so
far
as
complying
of
those
rigorous
standards
which
are
required
in
jurisdictional
matters,
the
court
below
said
this
--
the
ordinance,
as
we
construe
it,
is
constitutional.
as
i
said
before,
it
certainly
drew
into
question
to
whether
or
not
it
was
constitutional.
i
think
it
brings
into
play
perhaps
a
difference
in
the
judicial
code
which
started
with
the
amendments
of
1948
wherein
dealing
with
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
hear
an
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals,
one
of
the
federal
court
of
appeals,
it
was
necessary
that
the
statute
relied
upon
be
declared
to
be
repugnant
to
the
constitution
treaties
or
law
of
the
united
states
whereas
previously
it
was
only
necessary
as
in
cases
of
certiorari
from
the
state
court
to
draw
it
into
question.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
i
inquired
of
my
associates
from
alabama
as
to
whether
such
a
procedure
is
available
first
and
i'm
advised
that
it
is
in
some
form.
i
think
that
it
is
–
if
there
were
a
genuine
doubt
as
to
where
the
state
of
the
state
law
that
that
might
well
be
appropriate.
i
submit
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
james
lawrence
white
--
this
ordinance
means
what
it
says.
mr.
james
lawrence
white
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
thank
you
sir.
