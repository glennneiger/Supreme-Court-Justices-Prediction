did
mobile
--
was
mobile
taxed
in
that
earlier
period
under
the
same
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
essence
of
your
--
is
this
the
essence
of
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it
that
section
19
stands
totally
and
wholly
independently
from
the
tax
statute
that's
involved
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
the
trouble
with
the
dis
--
the
trouble
the
lower
court
was
that
it
lifted
over
so
to
speak
what
it
found
in
language
that
it
found
in
section
19
and
gave
that
as
the
characteristics
of
the
taxing
statute,
i
guess
and
that
in
determine
the
instance
of
the
tax,
we're
not
bound.
we
might
be
in
other
cases
to
characterizing
the
instance
with
this
tax
for
ourselves
to
see
whether
there's
a
federal
relation?
is
that
the
essence
of
your
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
section
16
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
your
argument
which
in
the
ordinance?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
it
provides
that
no
provision
of
this
clause
should
be
applied
(a)
so
as
to
impose
any
unlawful
tax
or
unlawful
burden
on
the
interstate
commerce
and
so
forth?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

i
was
thinking
it
would
have
a
bearing
on
the
construction
of
the
statute.

(inaudible),
i
thought
that
you

(inaudible)
justice
john

is
the

justice
john
m.
harlan
more
out
of
time.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
put
another
question
to
you
since
you
have
been
canvassing
a
lot
of
things,
supposing
one
has
left
in
doubt
as
to
what
the
proper
construction
of
this
statute
is
notwithstanding
judge
rives'
opinion,
but
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
send
you
back
to
the
state
court
to
get
interpretation
on
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
economics
of
this?
what's
the
dollar
amount
of
the
taxes
involved?
