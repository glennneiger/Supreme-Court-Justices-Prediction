may
i
ask
mr.
rhyne?
do
we
have
much
leeway
here
to
deal
with
the
--
what
the
court
below
said
that
this
ordinance
means
that
--
justice
william

--
to
the
extent
that
this
an
interpretation
of
the
ordinance
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

how
far
may
we
go
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordinarily,
we
give
considerable
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
local

we've
always
said
that
we
can
go

that
the
incidence
is
deliveries
and
not
sales,
is
that
in
the
label?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that's
to
say
that
was
merely
a
label
--
my
difficulty
is
that
when
they
read
the
ordinance
as
saying
it
is
on
delivery
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
on
sale,
is
that
the
label
to
what
was
done.
