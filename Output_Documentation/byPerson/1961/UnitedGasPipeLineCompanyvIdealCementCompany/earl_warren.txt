15.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
your
understanding
this
license
of
the
--
that
the
pipeline
company
is
required
to
pay
the
license
before
it
starts
to
operate
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
minimum
license
fees
for
other
kinds
of
business
in
gas
companies
in
this
--
in
this
ordinance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
would
be
an
exception
then
to
the
other
sections
of
the
ordinance
which
do
fix
minimums
for
other
kinds
of
businesses?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
other
businesses
for
which
there
is
no
minimum?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
white
i'm
--
i'm
just
wondering
if
section
19
and
section
20
would
apply
to
a
gas
company
if
there
is
no
minimum
for
them
to
pay
and
no
license
required
before
they
--
they
start
doing
business
because
section
19
says
that
any
person,
firm
or
association
or
corporation
who
shall
engage
in
any
business
trade
profession
or
keep
any
establishment
or
do
any
business
or
any
act
with
which
a
license
is
required
by
the
foregoing
ordinance
without
having
first
obtain
such
license
shall
upon
conviction
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
as
i
understand
it,
this
section
193
on
the
gas
companies
does
not
require
them
to
--
to
pay
any
license
fee
or
any
--
any
minimum
license
tax
when
they
commence
doing
--
doing
business,
but
there
is
another
section,
section
15
which
provides
for
tax
penalties
of
up
to
25%
in
the
event
they
don't
--
they
don't
pay
the
tax
and
i
wondered
if
the
city
is
--
is
limited
to
--
to
those
penalties
that
are
provided
for
in
section
15
rather
than
these
--
these
criminal
sections
which
you
have
pointed
out
to
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
the
--
we
got
to
start
some
place.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
let's
start
the
first
--
first
year.
now,
let's
have
a
gas
company
and
a
grocery
store.
if
a
grocery
store
started
to
do
business,
it
would
have
to
have
a
license
the
very
first
day
it
opened,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
anyone
did
open
a
grocery
store
without
--
without
paying
the
minimum,
whatever
it
might
be,
would
have
to
go
to
jail
under
this
ordinance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
a
gas
company,
as
far
as
we
can
see
from
these
sections,
could
start
in
and
could
do
business
for
an
entire
year
and
it
would
not
be
subject
to
these
penal
statutes,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
free
for
a
year.
what
i
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question
and
i'll
try
not
to
bother
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
gas
company
instead
of
distributing
its
gas
to
the
householders
and
to
the
retail
merchants
and
so
forth
in
the
city,
instead
of
doing
that
through
an
agent
as
it
does
now
which
is
paying
the
tax
undertook
to
make
the
distribution
to
those
consumers
in
exactly
the
way
it
does
with
these
two
large
ones
and
it
collected
the
charges
itself,
would
you
say
that
all
of
its
business
would
be
exempt
from
this
tax
on
the
grounds
that
it's
interstate
commerce
or
can
you
make
a
distinction
between
these
large
ones
and
the
small
ones?
chief
justice
earl
warren
quantitatively?
chief
justice
earl
warren
question
of
degree
or
whatever.

justice
