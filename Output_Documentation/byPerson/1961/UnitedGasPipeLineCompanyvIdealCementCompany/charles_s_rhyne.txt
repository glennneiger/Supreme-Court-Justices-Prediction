mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
interest
to
the
city
of
mobile
here
is
that
about
one-third
of
their
tax
revenues
is
involved
in
this
gross
receipts
tax
and
of
course
at
this
as
mr.
beggs
has
said
applies
to
natural
gas.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
would
be
very
easy
for
to
the
local
people
or
united
to
just
print
a
form
contract
and
turn
over
all
the
costumers
to
the
pipeline
and
call
them
all
direct
sales
and
escape
the
tax
completely
and
the
same
thing
could
be
done
in
the
field
of
electricity.
so
this
is
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
would
be
an
identical
situation
because
this
gas
comes
to
city
gate
and
it's
commingled
with
all
the
other
gas
and
until
--
and
it
goes
trough
the
same
lines
as
all
the
other
domestic
gas
handled
by
mo
--
mobile
gas
service,
it
reduces
the
pressure
and
all
of
that
kind
of
thing
and
so
some
of
the
gas
goes
into
this
plant
and
some
other
goes
to
joe
dox
next
door.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
--
i'd
like
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
grant
you
just
a
matter
of
convenience
only
because
they
could
have
a
contract
with
joe
dox
who
uses
this
--
a
tiny
little
bit
of
gas
as
much
as
they
can
have
a
contract
with
that
--
tremendous
use
or
such
as
involved
here.
now,
i
would
like
in
this
case
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
isn't
a
licensing
ordinance
in
the
conventional
or
regulatory
sense.
this
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
pardon?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yeah,
it's
not.
i
thought
it's
not.
it's
not
a
regulatory
ordinance
in
the
conventional
or
creational
sense.
there
are
no
preconditions
to
the
engaging
in
the
natural
gas
business
under
this
ordinance
at
least
in
the
city
of
mobile.
the
taxes
imposed
on
the
business
of
selling,
the
business
of
selling
gas.
there
is
no
minimum
requirement.
the
tax
is
paid
on
march
1,
a
year
after
they
begin
selling.
it's
--
it's
measured
by
the
preceding
year's
business.
there,
the
court
below
got
very
concerned
about
the
fact
that
in
the
alabama
code,
there
is
an
injunction
which
they
claim
might
be
used
to
stop
the
flow
of
--
of
interstate
commerce.
there's
no
injunction
in
this
ordinance
at
all.
i
express,
there's
no
discretion
to
refuse
a
license.
i
think
that
the
court
below
was
confused
by
labels
rather
that
the
practical
effect
of
this
particular
tax.
now,
this
type
of
tax
has
been
upheld
by
this
--
this
court
at
least
in
my
view
in
--
in
two
cases,
southern
natural
gas
company
versus
alabama
in
301
u.s.
where
it
was
a
franchise
tax
as
i
grant
you,
but
it
was
tax
imposed
on
the
sales
within
the
state
of
alabama
by
direct
seller,
the
pipeline
or
a
direct
sale.
the
same
thing
in
interstate
oil
pipeline
company
versus
stone,
337
u.s.
and
in
memphis
natural
gas
company
versus
beeler
where
there
was
a
3%
tax
on
net
income
from
sales
of
natural
gas
by
a
pipeline
company
to
a
direct
user.
now,
there's
no
difference
really
here
between
the
gross
receipts
or
privilege
tax
and
the
taxes
that
were
imposed
there
because
there
is
no
regulation,
there
is
no
burden
on
interstate
commerce
whatever.
the
--
the
interstate
seller
is
treated
identically
with
the
intrastate
seller
and
to
give
interstate
commerce
this
tremendous
competitive
advantage
over
a
local
commerce
is
something
that
this
court
has
always
guarded
against
and
it
has
emphasized
that
it
merely
struck
down
taxes
that
give
a
competitive
advantage
to
the
local
intrastate
rather
than
interstate
seller.
so
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
he
--
he
is
wrong
when
he
says
they
must
pay
a
tax
as
a
precondition
to
doing
business,
but
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
now
he
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter
is
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
having
first
obtained
any
license.
the
only
money
is
to
be
paid
at
the
end
of
year,
no
money
in
the
beginning.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
not
to
this
particular
gross
receipts
tax
because
i
should
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
particular
ordinance
encompasses
a
lot
of
things.
it
encompasses
a
tax
on
gasoline
for
example,
a
room
tax
on
hotel,
many
different
things
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
well
i
think
you
have
the
same
language
before
you
and
it's
an
interpretation
of
--
of
an
ordinance
and
their
--
their
interpretation
is
certainly
not
binding
on
this
court.
for
example
they
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
yes,
but
not
--
i
think
from
the
--
the
circuit
court
of
appeal.
for
example,
they
say
something
about
the
gas
entering.
this
being
imposed
when
the
gas
enters
mobile.
well,
the
provision
of
the
ordinance
that
refers
to
entering
is
a
reference
to
the
taxpayer
entering.
and
the
taxpayer
that
already
entered
the
city
and
had
a
tax
paid
just
within
the
city
before
the
tax
was
imposed
that
the
--
the
taxpayer
united
entered
the
city
in
1954
when
these
contracts
were
made,
really
to
escape
federal
rate
regulation.
so
the
taxpayer
was
already
there.
now,
the
mistake
that
the
court
below
made
i
--
i
sincerely
submit
was
it
didn't
consider
this
little
code
as
a
whole
and
that
the
different
parts
of
it.
part
of
it
i
say
is
--
is
a
gasoline
tax,
part
of
it
is
a
--
a
room
tax
and
part
of
it
is
this
gross
receipts
tax.
now,
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
my
experience
sir
--
if
your
honor
please
that
a
very
few
courts
change
--
petitions
for
rehearing
and
i
would
say
that
the
court
was.
it
repeated
the
error
that
it
made
before
and
--
and
that
i
don't
think
that
makes
it
any
more
corrected
than
it
was
the
first
time.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
would
say
this
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
--
i
would
say
so.
but
i
--
i
do
think
that
here,
that
the
court
below
completely
misconceived
the
incidence
of
this
tax
in
saying
it
was
on
delivery
instead
of
on
sale
and
this
court
had,
many
time,
upheld
taxes
on
sales
measured
by
the
gross
receipt
there
from
and
i
think
that
that's
a
fundamental
error
that
the
court
below
didn't
face
up
to
at
all
and
in
doing
so,
it
ignored
the
--
the
many
cases
in
this
court
but
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
i'm
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
the
essence
of
our
argument
in
that
--
that
is
our
position
and
of
course
we
also
take
the
position
that
where
there's
no
discrimination
against
or
burden
on
interstate
commerce
or
competitive
advantage
to
interstate
commerce
that
this
court
has
held
that
interstate
commerce
must
pay
its
fair
share
of
the
conduct,
the
state
and
the
local
government
and
here
were
you
have
the
separate
instance,
the
sale
taking
place
mobile,
the
billing
and
all
of
these
things
that
mr.
beggs
referred
to,
that
if
the
city
of
mobile
does
have
the
power,
without
conflict
to
the
constitution
to
impose
this
type
of
tax.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no
sir,
he
went
off
from
the
transportation
case
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
agree.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
true,
that's
true.
he
considered
spector
and
calvert
cases
where
there
were
taxes
imposed
on
the
flow
or
stream
of
commerce
as
distinguished
from
the
sale
at
end
of
the
line.
so
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
none
that
i
know
of
this
--
it
was
not
in
person.
i
think
it
that
--
that
the
interpretation
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
certainly
not
binding
on
this
court.
you
can
look
at
page
--
the
old
--
overall
of
this
ordinance
and
see
just
exactly
what
is
tax
and
what
effect,
if
any,
it
has
on
interstate
commerce.
it's
kind
of
a
practical
judgment
in
these
cases.
i
think
mr.
justice
clark
pointed
out
there
more
than
300
and
so
decisions
of
this
court
relating
to
this
particular
type
of
problem
and
always
the
court
has
not
looked
at
the
label,
the
label.
the
word
“license”
i
think
implied
regulation
or
something
and
scared
the
court
below.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
that
it's
not
and
i
think
that
we're
on
the
very
face
of
the
language
of
the
ordinance
it
says
it's
on
sales
that
obviously
the
court
below
is
wrong.
now,
they
--
they
reached
out
and
tried
to
use
some
other
parts
of
the
ordinance.
it
didn't
relate
to
this
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
particular
tax.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
say
they
were
i
can't
confuse
by
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
is
entitled
by
licensed
ordinance
and
within
that
ordinance,
you
have
all
of
these
different
types
of
taxes
that
are
imposed.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
we
would
have
except
i
think
that
the
--
the
effect
on
interstate
commerce
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
so
very
minimal
and
there
is
no
competitive
disadvantage
to
it.
no
discrimination
against
it
so
that
even
so,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
below
faced
up
to
the
line
of
decisions
to
this
court
that
said
that,
“even
though
it
was
imposed
on
interstate
commerce,
if
all
these
things
don't
exist,
the
tax
is
valid.”
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
we're
not
contesting
that
in
the
sightless
and
i'll
say
our
position
if
you
well
know
is
taxes
on
the
sale
and
stuff.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
all
of
these
imaginary
things
so
the
court
below
have
never
a
arisen
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
have
mr.
beggs
--
he
represents
united
and
i
represent
the
city,
but
they
haven't
been
denied
any
--
