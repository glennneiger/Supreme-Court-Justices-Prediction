mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
the
federal
act
your
honor
has
as
its
prime
purpose
and
it
is
set
out
in
the
act,
it
is
set
out
in
the
legislative
history,
the
creation
of
a
uniform,
classification,
standard
system
of
tobacco.
now,
the
act
itself
says,
“uniform
standards
for
classification
and
inspection
of
tobacco,
section
2.”
they
repeat
it.
the
legislative
history
is
build
up
with
--
with
the
controversy
between
the
proponents
of
the
act
who
claim
that
uniform
standards
of
classification
were
necessary
and
the
opponents
who
said,
“no,
this
is
a
local
problem,
leave
it
up
to
the
states.”
congress
in
adopting
the
act,
adopted
the
argument
of
the
proponents,
and
in
fact
as
i
said,
put
it
into
the
act
itself.
now,
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
under
the
authority
granted
him
in
the
statute
has
established
seven
different
classes
of
tobacco,
the
27
different
types,
perhaps
there's
as
many
as
200
different
grades
et
cetera
down
the
line.
he
has
also
said,
that
the
tobacco
of
the
identical
--
the
characteristics,
the
same
quality,
and
length,
and
moisture
and
so
on
and
so
forth
shall
be
type
identically,
no
mater
where
it
may
have
been
grown
by
the
accidents
of
geography.
in
other
words,
the
tobacco
grown
on
one
side
in
savannah,
the
river,
the
tobacco
grown
on
the
other
side,
if
it
has
the
same
characteristics
physically,
it
will
have
the
same
type
whether
that'd
be
14
or
13
or
12
or
what
have
you.
now,
the
state
of
georgia
--
i
mean,
we
continue
one
more
point.
the
act
also
has
as
its
purpose
not
just
the
establishment
of
classification
and
standards
in
vacuum,
but
the
communication
of
those
standards
to
the
buyer
and
the
seller
in
order
to
bring
some
order
to
the
chaos
that
range
at
--
ranged
in
the
tobacco
markets
before
1935.
legislative
history
is
full
of
descriptions
of
the
way
this,
as
my
friend
said,
“the
thousands
of
the
tobacco
farmers
were
--”
well
the
words
--
the
one
congressman
was
subject
to
the
wholesale
of
robbery
by
the
few
buyers
and
speculators
mainly
because
the
farmer
did
not
know
what
type
and
grade
of
tobacco
he
had.
the
buyers
had
their
own
systems.
the
farmers
might
have
a
system
and
there
was
just
mass
confusion.
the
congress,
as
i
said,
wanted
this
information
of
the
classification
of
a
particular
lot
tobacco
to
communicate
to
the
buyer
and
the
seller.
it
gave
authority
for
this
to
the
secretary.
the
secretary
set
forth
two
requirements
for
the
communication,
one,
that
the
type
and
the
grade,
now
not
just
the
grade
but
the
type
and
the
grade
it
says
in
the
regulations,
be
on
the
warehouse
ticket
that
is
on
the
basket
then
secondly,
that
the
auctioneer
when
he
begins
the
auction
of
a
lot
of
tobacco
shall
to
publicly
announce
this
information,
so
that
the
buyers
and
the
sellers
know
what
they
are
dealing
with.
that
is
the
federal
statute.
the
state
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
is
correct.
as
i
understand
it,
about
an
hour
or
so
before
the
auction
starts,
one
or
more
federal
inspectors
start
to
go
down
the
road
one-by-one.
there
maybe
one
inspector
to
a
small
warehouse.
there
maybe
as
many
as
three
or
five
in
a
large
warehouse
and
they
inspect
each
basket
of
tobacco;
they
pull
out
different
leaves
from
different
--
different
areas
within
the
basket
to
get
what
they
consider,
a
represented
its
sample.
and
then
they
make
this
determination,
what
is
the
type,
what
is
the
grade?
now,
i
might
point
out
at
this
point
that
if
an
interest
deportee,
either
the
farmer
or
somebody
who
buys
a
tobacco
is
unhappy
about
the
--
the
typing
and
grading,
he
can
ask
the
original
inspector
to
re-inspect,
to
reclassify.
he
can
also
call
in
that
inspector's
supervisor
who
is
--
probably
in
the
same
warehouse
if
--
if
not
his
in
the
same
locality
to
re-inspect.
and
finally,
there
is
an
appeal,
the
procedure
to
the
tobacco
division
of
agriculture
department
and
they
have
the
field
offices
with
some
one
designated
to
do
it
so
that
there
would
be
a
day
or
maybe
two
days
to
lay
that,
but
as
you
say,
this
is
all
done
before
the
--
the
actual
auction.
at
the
time
of
the
auction,
this
information
is
publicly
announced.
now,
the
georgia
has
come
in
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--
there
are
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
there
are
seven
classes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
there
are
27
types
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
they
are
--
well,
i
know
in
flue-cured,
they
are
168
different
grades
and
somebody
just
told
me
that
there
are
more
in
some
other
classes
of
tobacco.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
so
i
--
there
are
--
i
will
say
upwards
of
200
different
grades.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
27
types,
at
the
present
time.
now,
may
i
point
out
that
this
is
subject
to
change
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--
because
as
condition
has
been
changed,
the
secretary
has
amended
his
classifications
from
time
to
time.
i
assume
--
i'm
sure
it
is
done
through
(inaudible)
proceedings
where
anybody
who's
interested
and
come
in
and
get
his
opinion
as
to
what
should
be
done.
at
the
moment,
i
am
informed
that
the
tobacco
growers
in
florida
claimed
they
have
entirely
distinctive
type
and
they
wanted
the
cc
from
georgia
and
have
a
type
number
15
down
there.
i
understand
this
is
under
the
consideration
of
agriculture
now.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
sure.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
you
will
not
only
one
more,
but
you
would
have
a
different
one
using
the
same
terminology.
you
would
also
have
--
you
--
all
that
georgia
has
done
here,
and
i
want
to
point
this
out
because
i
think
it
is
very
important.
all
that
georgia
has
done
here
is
to
set
up
a
definition
for
type
number
14.
if
they
are
permitted
to
do
this,
i
see
no
legal
distinction
why
they
cannot
come
in
and
set
up
their
own
standard
for
168
different
grades
for
type
13,
12
and
11.
i
--
i
don't
see
why
north
carolina
can't
do
the
same
thing
etcetera
and
etcetera,
going
right
back
to
where
we
start
it
from
1935.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
it
does
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
are
price
reports
out,
i
believe
every
marketing
day
and
their
average
is
every
week
and
there's
a
monthly
report
and
well,
you
know
what
the
department
will
publish.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
correct
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
would
say
your
honor,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
it
--
it
may
be
in
the
sense
that
once
the
buyer
and
the
seller
knows
what
the
type
and
grade
is
at
a
particular
basket
of
tobacco.
now,
after
all
there
are
certainly
impurely
of
grade,
everybody
agrees
with
that.
there
is
some
controversy
as
to
whether
one
type
is
better
than
another.
i
--
i
refuse
to
get
into
that,
but
the
--
there
are
certainly
impurely
of
grades.
there
are
grades
that
there
are
--
there's
a
tobacco
that
is
water
logged
in
which
case
it
gets
a
certain
grade
or
if
it
is
too
dry
or
if
it's
tore
or
what
you
have
you,
this
all
goes
into
the
grading
system.
so,
once
the
buyer
and
seller
know
what
the
type
and
grade
of
tobacco
is,
they
have
the
basis
to
bargain.
they
know
what
they
are
getting,
and
they
know
what
they
are
selling.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well
as
my
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
as
my
brother
here
pointed
out,
in
a
cigarette,
you
have
a
blend,
you
have
and
if
the
lucky
strike,
the
people
--
pardon
me,
you
have
a
large
percentage
of
scrap
that
is
your
lowest
grades.
now,
i
would
assume
that
there
is
a
surging,
a
competitive
supply,
and
the
demand
system
on
scrap.
if
there
is
an
enough
scrap,
the
price
of
scrap
will
go
up
--
because
they
have
to
have
it.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
type
and
grade.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
right.
it
is
intended
too
by
congress.
and
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
correct.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
if
you
read
this
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
vacuum,
then
i
would
agree
word-for-word,
there
is
no
substantial
difference,
but
you
can't
read
it
in
vacuum.
it
was
not
intended
in
vacuum,
it
is
not
applied
in
vacuum
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
would
now
i
like
to
draw
your
attention
to
page
six.
up
near
the
top
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
of
the
page,
of
my
brief,
where
there
is
a
definition
of
the
term
“types”.
and
under
that
definition,
this
is
about
a
third
of
the
way
--
way
down,
it
says,
“tobacco
which
has
the
same
characteristics
and
corresponding
qualities,
colors
and
length
shall
be
treated
as
one
type,
regardless
of
any
factors
of
historical
or
a
geographic
nature
which
cannot
be
determined
from
an
--
an
examination
of
the
--
the
tobacco.”
now,
there
was
a
purpose
for
putting
that
in.
the
purpose
was
pointed
out
by
the
secretary
when
he
first
promulgated
these
regulations.
the
secretary
said
that
it
is
not
possible
without
a
considerable
detail,
to
specify
all
of
the
sections
in
which
a
certain
type
is
produced,
or
to
include
all
the
local
names.
he
went
on
that
in
the
present
classification,
now
this
is
the
first
time
he
promulgated
these
--
these
standards,
in
the
present
classification,
it
has
been
the
purpose
of
the
department
to
use
a
sufficient
number
of
names
to
identify
each
type
of
tobacco,
to
supplement
this
information,
the
principal
sections
in
which
each
type
is
produced
are
also
shown.
in
case,
the
local
name
of
a
type
or
the
section
in
which
it
is
produced
is
not
covered
under
the
description
of
the
type,
it
does
not
follow
that
that
the
tobacco
is
of
a
different
type.
the
following
rule
will
assist
in
determining
the
type
in
which
any
tobacco
shall
be
placed
and
then
he
--
he
quoted
that
--
the
rule
that
i
referred
you
to
your
honor.
now,
i
set
this
out
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--
this
is
our
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
on
page
23
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--
in
case,
the
local
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
the
23
of
my
brief
on
top,
the
top
line,
in
case,
the
local
name
of
a
type
or
the
section
in
which
it
is
produced
is
not
covered
under
the
description
of
the
type,
it
does
not
follow
that
the
tobacco
is
of
a
different
type.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but
what
this
is
saying
mr.
justice
black
is
that
in
the
definition
of
type
14,
it
would
not
be
practical
who
list
in
every
state
in
which
it
might
possibly
be
grown.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
instead
they
have
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
right.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
---
that
right.
so
that,
if
you
have
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but
what
this
says
is
that
the
growing
for
that
type
is
not
necessarily
limited
to
those
geographic
areas.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
that
is
shown
in
the
regulation
which
i
refer
to
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--
it
is
printed
directly
under
that
--
in
that
sentence
which
you
--
you
and
i
just
have
been
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--
talking
about,
where
it
says,
any
tobacco,
just
--
just
two
lines
down.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
because
your
honor,
it
was
intended
that
the
special
rule
that
you
call,
be
only
the
--
the
naming
of
the
principal
places
of
production
of
that
particular
type.
if
that
particular
type
is
grown
elsewhere,
and
after
all,
you
--
you
can't
tell
from
year
--
for
year
what
a
farmer
might
--
might
(voice
overlap)
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
it
has
been
that
when
the
inspector
examines
a
lot
of
tobacco,
he
examines
it
for
both
the
type
and
grade,
and
he
says
that,
“this
is
type
14”
even
though
and
it
has
grown
in
south
carolina.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
the
record
is
on
page.
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
it
quickly
here.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
your
--
your
honor,
may
i
make
this
clear
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
no
that's
--
there
is
nothing
uncommon
about
--
about
designating
any
agriculture
commodity
from
the
state
that
it
comes,
but
that's
not
this
case.
if
georgia
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--
would
here
come
in
and
say
that
we
want
all
georgia
grown
the
tobacco,
to
have
a
label
on
it
grown
in
georgia,
then
we
would
have
a
different
case.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
flue-cured.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
--
that's
right
sir.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
it
would
--
conflict
if
they
say
if
georgia
says
that
tobacco
grown
georgia
only
or
for
in
alabama,
they're
minor
commodity,
but
if
--
if
--
if
the
georgia
comes
in
and
says
that
tobacco
sold
in
georgia
can
be
type
14,
only
if
it
is
grown
in
georgia,
florida
and
alabama,
and
not
if
it
is
this
grown
across
the
savannah
river.
what
they
have
done
to
establish
a
different
type
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
if
–
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
would
say
your
honor--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
would
say
that
we,
it
wouldn't
have
a
situation
of
conflict
then
but
we
would
then
have
the
problem
of
preemption
and
what
the
georgia
could
act
within
this
--
this
area.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
was
it
in
the
varnville
case
that
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
it
was
--
it
was
preemption,
but
that's
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but
the
--
the
thing
is
your
honor
to
know
that
the
federal
regulation
is
not
as
you
have
stated.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
mean
i
think
that's
not
how
it
has
been
enforced
(voice
overlap)
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
here
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
would
say
that
the
answer
is
yes
sir
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--
because
they
used
type
14.
if
they
would
only
use
grown
in
georgia,
then
we
would
have
a
different
situation.
but
the
fact
is
they
have
used
a
phrase
the
type
14,
which
has
a
specific
meaning
in
the
(inaudible)
and
what
they
are
doing,
even
if
they
are
coincidently
--
even
if
they
are
assisting
the
government
and
there
are
many
cases
--
i
mean
the
santa
fe
elevator
case
(inaudible)
and
many
others,
where
this
--
this
court
has
said
that
where
congress
has
acted,
the
states
cannot
and
assist.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
would
say
there
is
no
practical
conflict.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
there
is
no
practical
conflict,
but
there
is
this.
there
is
a
different
requirement
on
the
warehousemen.
there
is
the
fact
that
they
are
coming
into
an
area
on
which
congress
through
its
own
and
through
the
secretary
of
agriculture
as
the
fully
(inaudible)
i
mean
there's
no
argument
there.
the
--
the
townsend
case
was
brought
up
yesterday
as
an
--
an
example
where
the
congress
under
--
of
this
act
did
not
preempt
a
field,
but
that
was
a
different
subject
in
townsend.
but
in
this
subject,
the
subject
or
classification
and
identification
of
the
--
of
the
tobacco
who
--
and
congress
through
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
fully
legislated
and
as
this
court
has
stated
many
times
that
the
state
cannot
come
in
even
to
the
aid
of
congress
that
they
cannot
make
any
additional
or
supplemental
regulations.
the
--
the
napier
case
where
--
where
the
icc
through
under
the
act
of
congress
prescribed
certain
matters
as
far
as
train,
the
local
motive
is
concerned.
he
said
absolutely
did
nothing
about
a
curtain
on
the
--
on
the
cab.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
sure,
okay.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
alright.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
right.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
your
honor
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
you
have
--
before
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
you
have
before
you
both
questions?
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
now,
where
is
that,
the
question
of
conflict?
it
is
the
position
the
government
that
the
geography
does
not
make
any
difference
in
the
typing
of
tobacco,
that
tobacco
grown
across
the
savannah
river
in
south
carolina,
if
it
has
the
same
characteristics
as
type
14
(voice
overlap)
should
have
is
type
14
tobacco.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
they
have
said
that
only
tobacco
grown
in
georgia,
florida
and
alabama
can
be
type
14.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
argue.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
right.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
right.
now,
face
of
--
on
the
face
of
--
and
may
if
i
point
out
your
honor
that
there
is
a
--
that
his
works
cumbrously.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
if
you
don't
agree
with
me
on
the
first
then
we
get
to
the
second.
[attempt
to
laughter]
but
if
i
may
point
this
out
that
the
--
the
conflict
works
conversely
also
that
the
tobacco
that
is
grown
in
georgia,
that
the
federal
inspector
would
say
that
this
is
type
13
or
12
or
11,
that
the
georgia
statute
would
say,
“no,
it's
grown
in
georgia
and
therefore
it's,
the
14.”
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
my
--
my
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--
opponents
controvert
it.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
the
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
in
my
mind
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
in
my
mind,
it's
a
matter
of
reading
the
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
you
read
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
the
definition
of
type
14
in
the
federal
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
alright.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
page
8.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
the
top
of
the
page.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
read
that
in
light
of
the
definition
of
types
on
6
of
my
brief.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
and
read
in
the
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
the
georgia
statute,
the
georgia
--
the
definition
of
14
which
i
will
find
for
you
in
just
a
moment.
it's
in
section
1
for
the
statute
back
in
the
appendix
that
i
know.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
pardon?
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
no
sir.
no
trouble
whatsoever.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
the
government
says
that
it
is
a
conflict
your
honor
and
--
and
we
--
we
submit
on
that
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
in
my
opinion,
yes
your
honor.
may
i
point
out
one
more
thing?
i
know
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
it
maybe
as
mr.
harrison
has
contended
here
that
there
is
a
reason
to
draw
certain
geographic
lines
because
the
nicotine
content
or
chemical
content
or
what
have
you.
i'm
--
i'm
not
arguing
that.
i'm
not
a
chemist.
i'm
not
an
expert
on
that,
but
there
is
a
re-course
open
to
the
georgia
interest.
if
they
wish
that
these
factors
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
the
federal
standards,
they
can
go
to
the
sector
of
agriculture
under
the
ruling
and
proceedings,
present
their
evidence
and
ask
for
the
classification
that
they
contend
should
be
made.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
your
honor
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
he
believes
he
has
done
that
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
--
but
he
can
--
and
make
it
the
explicit
if
the
--
the
court
rules,
otherwise
it's
not
georgia.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
your
honor,
you
have
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
you
have
within
the
other
definitions.
you
have
other
types
and
other
classes
of
tobacco
that
are
grown
elsewhere,
that
where
--
would
also
be
grown
in
other
states.
it
is
--
why
did
you
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
can't
answer
that
your
honor.
may
i
point
out
also
that
if
what
the
georgia
interests
are,
they're
complaining
about
is
that
the
inspectors
have
not
been
properly
enforcing
the
federal
regulations.
now,
that
is
one
thing
they
can
bring
up
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
in
this
--
in
this
court
which
they
have
not
renewed
in
their
--
their
brief.
but
again,
they
have
an
appeal
procedure
open
to
them
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
they
are
not
right
in
our
view
in
running
to
the
state
of
georgia
to
intercede
itself
between
a
tobacco
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
jul
--
well,
you
mean
in
this
court
or?
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
--
i
believe
that
--
he
believes
that
it's
not
ambiguous.
that's
all
i
can
say.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
do
sir.
