mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
if
the
federal
inspector
had
classified
the
south
carolina
and
north
carolina
tobacco
as
type
14
and
was
dust-free
and
was
precluded
under
the
georgia
act
from
having
a
white
tag
place
their
own,
we
have
no
case.
we
cannot
conflict
with
the
federal
government
and
with
duly
authorize
the
regulations
all
with
the
statute
and
we
recognize
it,
but
we
say
there
is
no
conflict.
let's
keep
in
mind
that
the
very
definition
that
is
described
to
type
14
tobacco
and
may
i
say
at
the
outset
i
hope
the
court
will
keep
firmly
in
mind
that
there
is
a
difference
between
type
and
between
grades.
a
type
is
a
broad
general
classification
with
that,
we
have
adopted
a
--
the
state
of
georgia
has
adopted
the
federal
government's
definition.
there
is
absolutely
no
effort
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
georgia
in
its
acts
or
otherwise,
to
tamper
with,
change
or
in
anyway
communicate
grade.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
grade
is
a
subdivision
of
type
your
honor
and
grade
as
said
by
mr.
durben
is
the
place
where
the
--
where
price
is
determined.
it's
just
like
the
difference
between
a
kansas
city
state
prime
and
a
st.
louis
missouri
state
prime.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
i'm
saying
your
honor
that
that's
supposing
the
possibility
of
a
conflict
and
we
have
here
a
record
before
this
court
in
which
there
is
not
one
iota
of
evidence
to
--
in
the
infirmity
and
indeed
if
the
evidence
is
in
the
contrary
that
none
of
this
tobacco
that
was
brought
down
there,
even
on
the
29.1096,
the
broad
general
classification
would
have
or
was
classified
as
type
14.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
yes
sir.
he
could
classify
there's
type
14
your
honor
but
he
has
not
done
so
and
--
and
the
complainants
themselves
in
their
complaint
said
that
there're
all
be
inspector.
the
secretary's
agent
did
was
to
grade
the
tobacco,
not
make
any
classifications.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
no
sir.
i
say,
there
is
--
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not
make
--
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
--
there
is
a
conflict
because
he
then
proceeds
himself
to
define
it
or
based
on
geography
alone.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
that's
on
the
page
8
of
the
government's
brief.
he
says
that
type
14
and
incidentally,
the
general
broad,
general
classification
is
cfr
29.1096.
this
is
29.1100
which
follow.
type
14
is,
and
this
is
secretary's
definition,
that
type
of
flue-cured
tobacco
commonly
known
as
southern
flue-cured
or
new
belt
of
georgia,
florida
and
alabama
produced
principally
in
the
southern
section
of
georgia
and
if
i
may
interpolate,
produced
to
some
extent
in
florida
and
alabama.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
absolutely
excludes
under
the
present
pending
definition.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
yes,
sir
but
if
you
don't
--
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
and
if
said
--
say
included
those
minor
situations,
florida
and
alabama
and
since
in
this
record,
if
your
honor
please,
defendant's
exhibit
one
shows
a
map
promulgated
and
it's
identified
as
the
defendant's
exhibit
one
shows
a
map
which
outlines
the
various
types
and
in
this
map
it
show
--
itself
shows
that
which
has
been
described
as
an
official
determination
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
shows
that
the
type
14
is
grown
only
in
georgia,
florida
and
alabama.
now,
i
do
admit
sir
that
there
is
the
possibility
that
a
man
across
the
savannah
river,
right
across
could
grow
type
14
tobacco
and
that
the
secretary
on
the
10.96
might
subsequently
could
classify
it
as
type
14,
but
if
this
court
said
in
(inaudible)
against
the
united
states,
we've
got
a
set
of
concrete
facts
here
that
secretary
has
identified
it
as
georgia,
florida
and
alabama.
the
secretary,
and
there's
no
evidence
here
that
there
is
any
other
possibility
or
if
indeed
that
person
is
not
now
before
this
court.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
not
so
--
according
to
his
official
publication,
defendant's
exhibit
one,
which
is
a
map
shown
in
the
area,
not
according
to
the
witness.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
they
fall
in
13,
12
and
11.
it
goes
up
to
the
line.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
that,
your
honor,
the
defendant's
exhibit
one
was
not
printed
in
record.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
well
--
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
yes
sir,
which
i
have
in
my
hand
--
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
it
was
just
not
printed.
it
was
sent
up,
yes
sir.
and
also
in
page
125
of
the
record
--
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
how
does
he
treat
it
your
honor?
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
it
is
called
type
13
or
the
type
12.
there
is
no
carolina
type
14
tobacco
under
the
secretary‘s
regulation.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
now,
that's
my
understanding
your
honor.
i'm
certain
that's
true
but
i
don't
--
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
--
make
some
statement.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
page
125
your
honor.
it's
a
testimony
of
an
employee
of
the
department
of
agriculture,
tobacco
division,
in
which
she
identified
this
court's
record
which
was
not
printed
and
said
that
it's
an
official
publi
--
publication
and
then
i
interpret
it
is
to
be
in
the
official
determination.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
this
is
the
gentleman
who
works
in
the
tobacco
division
of
the
department
of
agriculture
your
honor
who
sat
in
as
the
record
reveals
on
the
drawing
of
the
georgia
act
and
who
incidentally
after
the
passage
of
the
georgia
act
as
the
record
reveals
had
the
secretary
put
the
last
of
secretary
was
put
in
to
effect
in
florida
exactly
the
same
thing
to
put
blue
and
white
tags
on
tobacco
grown
in
those
areas.
on
page
–
the
very
complaint
here
shows
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
sub
--
that
counsel
or
the
appellants,
appellees
and
counsel
to
the
government
are
dealing
with
the
proposition
that
possibly
georgia
could
at
some
future
take
be
in
conflict
with
the
federal
definition
and
if
someone
keep
up
and
was
excluded.
but,
that
ignores
that
well-established
principle
that
when
you
--
this
court
is
treating
with
an
act
of
congress
on
an
act
to
the
legislature
that
you
will
do
everything
possible
to
uphold
that
act
and
that
you
will
not
suppose
or
imagine
a
case
that
to
give
rise
to
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
well,
and
it
went
on
to
say
and
to
some
extent
and
includes
and
defined
flor
--
including
florida
and
alabama
and
i
assume
that
to
some
extent
in
--
in
the
south
carolina,
they
had
been
in
any
view
that
have
them
in
the
regulation.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
no
dispute
and
that's
right
and
if
of
course
because
that
would
give
raise
to
the
passage
of
this
act.
we
can
of
course
be
in
conflict
regardless
of
how
(inaudible)
the
act
maybe
but
we
say
your
honor,
we
have
not
in
conflict
because
this
plaintiff
has
brought
this
case
here,
is
a
warehouseman.
so
far
as
this
court
knows,
so
for
as
the
world
knows,
there
is
not
now
in
existence
any
human
being
on
earth
who
does
produce
even
though
he
might
produce
type
14
tobacco
outside
of
the
states
of
georgia,
south
carolina
and
florida
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
way
that
this
act
can
be
said
to
be
in
conflict
is
based
on
the
outside
possibility
that
at
some
future
date,
someone
may
come
in
to
exist
into
on
to
federal
regulation
would
have
type
14
and
would
then
be
precluded
on
the
georgia
regulation.
that's
time
enough
for
that
person
to
complain
as
you
said
in
the
(inaudible)
against
the
united
state.
now,
here's
what
they
say
and
here's
the
real
complaint,
this
is
paragraph
12
of
the
complaint,
which
is
on
page
5
of
the
record
and
under
which
they
come
to
this
court,
this
case
gets
to
this
court,
under
the
federal
law
just
mentioned,
official
graders
of
the
united
states,
official
graders
of
the
united
states,
department
of
agriculture
grade
each
sheet
of
tobacco
or
pile
of
tobacco,
immediately
prior
to
it's
sale
so
that
said
official
grade
may
be
established.
this
grade
is
the
official
grade
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
grade,
if
your
honors
will
turn
page
39
of
the
government's
brief
and
look
at
section
511
(g),
the
grade
of
the
tobacco
is
the
thing
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
was
interested
in
communicating
to
the
purchasers
for
they
say,
and
this
is
in
the
act
no
and
not
the
regulation,
“warehousemen
shall
provide
space
on
warehouse
tickets
or
other
tags
or
labels
used
by
them
for
showing
the
grade
of
the
like
covered,
thereby
as
determined
and
authorized
by
the
tobacco
inspector.
the
secretary
may
prescribe
by
regulation
the
form
in
which
sets
the
deep
certification
of
grade
shall
be
shown
and
may
require
that
a
copy
of
it.
now,
the
secretary
has
gone
on
and
prescribed
a
regulation
which
includes
type,
grade
and
so
forth
but
his
employees
have
not
put
it
on
there.
no
way
on
any
of
these
blue
tags
that
you
have
because
they
have
designation
that
this
is
in
fact
type
14
tobacco.
if
it
is
--
if
the
south
carolina
tobacco
was
type
14
under
the
federal
definition
and
has
so
been
classified
by
their
inspectors,
we
would've
been
in
violation
of
the
constitution
in
trying
to
put
a
blue
tag
on.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
could
--
he
could
--
he
could
say
any
tobacco
anywhere.
yes
sir,
he
can
--
he
can
do
it.
no
question
about
that.
he's
got
us
by
--
to
--
got
control
of
it.
but
as
the
(inaudible)
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
but
on
(voice
overlap)
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
that's
--
well,
that's
the
right.
he'd
have
to
-
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
he
couldn't
exclude
that.
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor
and
--
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
oh
yes,
sir
and
there's
an
appeal
--
what
i
mean
is,
he
could
change
his
regulation
and
say
that
suddenly
including
to
some
extending
in
georgia,
florida,
alabama
and
south
carolina,
then
when
we
sought
to
enforce
our
act
against
the
south
carolina
man,
if
that
be
(inaudible),
we
would
be
in
violation
and
our
act
must
fall.
but
there
again
your
honor,
that
supposing
the
possibility
of
some
unknown
factor
and
dreaming
up
a
constitutional
question
that
may
or
may
not
--
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
when
did
the
secretary
--
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
when
the
government
--
i
mean,
when
this
court
invited
him
to
appear
here
--
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
no
sir.
the
--
the
position
of
the
department
of
agriculture
as
revealed
by
the
record,
i
think
we
must
imparted
one
its
employees
would
not
have
been
there
testify
was
favorable
to
--
this
act
and
that
there
was
no
conflict
in
our
definition.
the
map
itself
shows
it.
the
record
also
demonstrates
that
the
secretary
or
somebody
pursuant
to
a
party
from
the
secretary
put
the
same
proposition
in,
in
the
state
of
florida
and
only
lifted
it
when
the
temporary
injunction
was
issued
against
the
--
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
your
honor,
may
i
take
this
to
say
why?
this
court
as
i
don't
believe
that
we
have
given
--
been
fair
to
--
and
telling
you
exactly
what
gave
rise
to
this
litigation,
what's
the
dollars
and
cents
about
this
as
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
mr.
denmark
groover,
jr.
yes
sir.
maybe
too
many
dollars
and
too
few
cents
on
some,
but
this
--
there
are
two
things
that
georgia
was
interested
in
--
in
protecting.
type
14
as
it
revealed
by
page
115
of
the
record
has
special
qualities,
just
like
if
a
man
goes
to
the
grocery
store
and
he
wants
some
garlic
salt
instead
of
some
onion
salt,
he
will
pay
more
for
the
garlic
salt
than
he
would
for
the
onion.
it
won't
fit
in
the
recipe.
they
--
they
buy
this
tobacco
as
type
14
and
they
ship
it
all
over
the
world,
24
million
pounds,
the
previous
year
of
south
carolina
tobacco
had
come
on
out
in
the
market
to
the
extent
that
they
occupy
17%
of
our
total
market
and
thus
georgia
was
loosing
its
identity.
now,
the
second
and
a
very
important
thing
is
if
we
sell
out
tobacco
in
georgia,
florida
and
alabama
loose,
that
is
in
tangled
leaf
form.
the
other,
the
market
sell
it
in
tied
form,
they
have
to
type
by
the
in
so
that
the
machine
--
the
manufactures
pick
it
up
and
can
handle
it
manually.
well
with
this
tremendous
influx
of
--
of
the
loose
leaf
tobacco
that
would
normally
be
so
typed,
coming
in
to
our
market,
we
were
threatened
with
the
loss
and
as
testified
by
an
employee
of
the
department
of
agriculture,
we
will
--
we
were
threatened
with
a
loss
of
our
untied
tobacco
market.
now,
that
meant
this
to
us.
it
meant
first
by
our
sense
of
pound
if
we
could
possibly
type
and
second
the
record
demonstrates
beyond
question
that
because
of
the
show
occurrences,
we
couldn't
typed
our
tobacco
so
it
is
we
passed
this
act,
and
who
were
the
people
that
come
here
complaining?
it's
not
the
grower
in
south
carolina,
the
man
who
possibly
could
have
full
type
14
tobacco.
i
don't
know.
it's
not
him
but
it's
the
warehousemen
who
have
built
their
tobacco
warehouses
based
on
being
able
to
sell
other
than
any
product
properly
identified.
now,
it
may
well
be
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
the
reason
the
buyers
wouldn't
pay
on
blue
tag
tobacco,
the
same
price
they
would
pay
for
it
in
--
for
the
white
tag
is
because
they
wanted
to
discourage
this
loose
leaf
influx
too
on
account
manufacturing
culture
but
does
not
state
of
georgia's
activity.
that
maybe
--
it
maybe
the
counsel
for
the
warehousemen,
and
the
department
have
a
case
against
them
for
conspiracy,
but
not
to
strike
down
an
act
designed
and
passed
to
protect
the
vital
industry,
the
largest
single
of
cash
crop
in
our
home
state,
and
not
to
be
stricken
down
if
this
court
pleases
on
this
acquisition
that
at
some
future
date,
possibly
that
could
arise
a
conflict.
now,
on
the
only
question
of
preemption,
if
you
look
at
the
act
itself
i
think
it
would
be
different
--
it
will
be
shown
(inaudible),
shows
that
congress
did
not
intent
to
preempt
it
as
to
type
and
identification.
if
i
--
well,
let
