chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
durden,
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
issue
in
this
case
as
to
the
relative
merits
of
the
--
of
this
fruit
type
of
tobacco
that
is
grown
in
georgia,
and
alabama
and
the
new
so
called
new
belt
on
the
one
hand
and
that
--
and
that
grown
in
the
carolina's
or
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
durden,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
these
buyers
have
the
competence
to
walk
along
the
road
that
you
told
us
about
and
--
and
from
their
observation
while
they
re
buying
be
able
to
determine
this
came
from
georgia,
this
came
from
alabama,
this
came
from
the
carolinas?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
that
within
the
field
of
their
company?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
cannot.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
--
you
take
a
couple
of
minutes
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cohn.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
how
--
how
many
types
and
grades
mr.
cohn
did
you
say
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
had
been
classified
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture?
chief
justice
earl
warren
seven
classes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
27
types.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
pursue
that
just
one
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
one
--
one
more
step?
when
the
secretary
does
this,
he
classifies
all
of
the
tobaccos
in
america.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
the
georgia
law
is
permitted
to
stand
that
would
leave
us
with
it
with
one
more
grade
or
classification
then
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
set
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
secretary
of
agriculture
publish
market
reports
in
accordance
with
those
classifications?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
and
of
course
that
would
apply
only
to
the
classifications
he
had
made.

justice
earl
warren

your
brief?

chief
justice

alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
what
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
groover,
you
may
have
five
minutes.
actually,
mr.
groover,
that
was
time
we've
taken
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
groover,
how
does
the
secretary
treat
the
carolina
so
called
number
14,
type
14
tobacco
in
his
marketing
reports?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
so
he
solely
reports
in
his
daily
or
weekly
reports?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
groover,
it's
late
in
the
argument
to
ask
this
question
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure
in
my
own
mind,
is
it
your
--
your
position
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
not
provided
even
in
his
regulations
or
in
his
administrative
practices
that
this
tobacco
which
comes
from
the
carolina's
is
grade
--
is
type
14
tobacco?
