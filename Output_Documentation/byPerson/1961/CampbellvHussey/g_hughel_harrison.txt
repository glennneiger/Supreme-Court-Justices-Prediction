mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
state
of
georgia
is
authorized
to
require
the
identification
of
flue-cured
tobacco
at
the
time
that
it
has
offered
for
sale
in
the
tobacco
warehouses.
your
honor,
there
are
two
statutes
involved.
one
is
the
federal
tobacco
inspection
act
and
the
other
is
a
1960
act
of
the
georgia
general
assembly.
we
have
conceded
and
admit
that
in
the
event
that
the
federal
act
has
preempted
the
fees,
then
the
georgia
act
cannot
stand.
we
submit
that
the
controlling
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
congress
by
the
federal
tobacco
inspection
act
and
the
regulations
issued
thereon
which
relate
to
the
establishment
and
promotion
of
the
use
of
standards
of
tobacco
and
how
they
may
be
determined
as
precluded
to
state
of
georgia
from
protecting
a
product
of
that
state,
and
revealing
and
requiring
the
revealing
of
the
truth
of
the
product
at
the
time
it
is
offered
for
sale.
the
purpose
of
the
georgia
act
is
stated
and
at
least
four
times
in
the
act.
and
that
is,
that
it
is
to
provide
a
positive
means
of
identification.
it
sets
forth
right
in
the
title
of
the
act
in
section
1
in
defining
its
--
the
purpose,
is
found
in
section
13
(a)
and
in
section
13
(e)
of
the
georgia
act.
much
has
been
said
and
will
be
argued
before
this
court
as
to
the
means
and
mechanics
utilized
by
this
act
in
carrying
out
this
stated
purpose.
insofar
as
those
means
relate
to
geographic
areas
production
and
the
identification
that
is
employed,
it
is
submitted
that
these
factors
and
mechanical
mean
are
subservient
to
the
basic
issue
and
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
of
georgia
is
authorized
to
require
or
provide
identification.
in
that,
once
it
is
determined,
that
this
authority
exists
then
the
means
and
methods
employed
and
the
results
thereof
are
placed
in
their
proper
perspective.
again,
we
submit,
that
the
basic
issue
is
the
authority
of
the
state
of
georgia
to
require
the
identification.
the
federal
tobacco
inspection
act
was
enacted
by
the
congress
in
1935.
in
currin
versus
wallace,
there
was
an
attack
upon
the
constitutionality
of
this
act.
by
leave
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
read
an
excerpt
from
that
case
and
that
it
refers
to
a
previous
case
wherein
this
act
was
under
construction,
again
from
the
state
of
georgia,
wherein
the
warehousemen
had
complained
of
the
georgia
statute
fixing
the
maximum
fees
that
the
warehousemen
could
charge
for
their
services
in
selling
the
tobacco.
and
i
quote,
in
townsend
versus
yeomans
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
in
currin
versus
wallace,
sir.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
i
have
an
excerpt
from
currin
versus
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
from
this
court,
u.s.
supreme
court,
citation
306
u.s.1.
in
townsend
versus
yeomans,
301
u.s.
441,
we
recently
had
under
consideration
the
legislation
of
georgia
prescribing
maximum
charges
for
the
services
of
tobacco
warehousemen
who
conducted
their
business
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
prevailing
in
north
carolina.
there,
the
warehousemen
strongly
insisted
that
they
were
engaged
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
as
a
tobacco
sold
on
their
floors
was
destined
for
interstate
or
foreign
shipment,
and
hence
that
the
state
was
without
power
to
fix
their
fees.
they
invoked
the
federal
act
in
support
of
their
contention,
but
we
found
nothing
in
the
federal
act
which
undertook
to
regulate
the
charges
of
warehousemen
and
hence
we
concluded
that
congress
had
restricted
its
requirements
and
left
the
state
free
to
deal
with
the
matters
not
covered
by
the
federal
legislation
and
not
inconsistent
therewith.
the
authority
of
congress
to
enact
the
tobacco
inspection
act
was
not
questioned.
we
do
not
question
the
authority
here.
we
submit
that
a
reading
of
the
cases
shows
that
there
was
a
limited
purpose
in
the
congress
enacting
the
federal
tobacco
inspection
act,
and
that
is
that
the
act
was
enacted
so
as
to
remove
the
contusion
and
the
elimination
of
doubt
and
manipulation
in
the
tobacco
act
throughout
the
use
of
this
act.
it
is
stated
that
is
--
it
is
to
provide
a
uniform
method
for
determining
for
standards
and
for
the
classification
of
tobacco.
in
this
connection,
the
lower
court
cited
section
3
of
the
federal
act
in
support
of
its
opinion
that
there
should
be
scheme
of
federal
regulations
so
pervasive
as
to
leave
no
room
for
state
action.
this
section
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
u.s.
department
of
agriculture
to
investigate
the
sorting,
handling,
condition,
inspection
and
marketing
of
tobacco
from
time
to
time,
and
to
establish
standards
for
tobacco
by
which
its
type,
grade,
size,
condition,
or
other
characteristics
may
be
determined
which
standards
shall
be
the
official
standards
of
the
united
states,
thereafter
follow
other
provisions
of
this
section
relative
to
the
date
that
the
standard
shall
become
effective
and
authorizing
amendments
and
modification
thereto.
section
5
of
the
federal
act
provides
a
manner
by
which
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
designate
those
option
markets
where
tobacco
is
bought
and
sold
at
option.
it
specifically
requires
than
no
such
market
may
be
designated
and
subsequent
to
a
referendum
where
it
is
required
that
at
least
two
thirds
of
the
growers'
voting
favor
the
designation
of
the
market.
this
section
also
authorizes
the
secretary
to
temporarily
suspend
the
inspection
and
certification
requirements
at
any
designated
market
for
the
named
reason.
this
same
section
provides
that
nothing
contained
in
the
act
shall
be
construed
to
prevent
transactions
in
tobacco
--
at
markets
not
designated
by
the
secretary
or
at
designated
markets
where
the
inspection
and
certification
requirements
have
been
suspended.
the
declaration
of
purpose
contained
in
the
federal
act,
which
is
section
2,
states
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
includes
a
statement
that
without
uniform
standards
of
classification
and
inspection,
evaluation
is
subject
to
price
manipulation
and
other
evils
submit
that
the
federal
tobacco
inspection
act
is
by
its
terms
an
authorization
to
the
secretary
to
perform
named
acts.
the
determination
of
tobacco
by
grade
is
strict.
authorization
is
given
to
the
secretary
in
broad
language.
it
is
submitted
by
the
--
that
the
act
itself,
the
construction
of
the
act
by
this
court,
show
that
the
act
does
not
precludes
state
action.
under
the
federal
act,
the
secretary
had
determined
and
defined
four
basic
types
of
tobacco.
this
is
flue-cured
tobacco,
your
honor.
type
14
under
the
federal
act
is
defined
as
follows:
“that
type
of
flue-cured
tobacco,
commonly
known
as
southern
flue-cure
or
new
belt
of
georgia,
florida,
and
alabama,
produced
principally
in
the
southern
section
of
georgia
and
to
some
extent,
in
florida
and
alabama."
one
of
the
stipulation
that
was
entered
into
by
the
parties
and
as
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
is
as
follows,
it
is
stipulation
number
4
on
page
27
of
the
record,
“and
an
official
standard
of
the
united
states
the
federal
government
has,
under
the
federal
tobacco
inspection
act,
designated
types
11,
12,
13
and
14,
known
as
flue-cured
tobacco,
and
has
designated
as
type
14
tobacco
only
flue-cured
tobacco
grown
in
georgia,
florida,
and
alabama”.
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
type
of
the
production
of
type
14
tobacco
is
in
and
of
itself
relatively
new
when
compared
to
the
production
of
tobacco
in
other
years.
of
the
four
types,
three
of
these
types,
contain
language
that
give
leeway
that
the
principal
area
of
production
is
in
designated
areas
in
the
states
of
the
carolina's
and
virginia.
now,
the
language
employed
in
defining
type
14
goes
to
recognize
that
it
is
a
relatively
new
area
of
production
and
we
submit
that
under
this
definition,
under
the
federal
definition
of
type
14,
that
it
cannot
be
produced
in
any
other
area.
the
record
in
this
case,
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
supports
this
statement.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
testimony
in
this
record
shows
that
you
can
take
plants
from
one
bed
in
florida
--
plant
bed
in
florida
or
south
georgia
and
plant
it
in
the
different
production
areas
and
that
you
will
have
a
resulting
product
that
has
distinct
characteristics,
its
nicotine
content
would
vary.
the
aroma,
the
burning
qualities,
physical
properties
and
chemical
content,
and
while
we're
there,
your
honor,
the
production
of
type
14,
the
qualities
of
type
14,
as
such
that
it
is
in
demand
not
because
of
its
superiority,
not
because
any
other
grade
is
inferior,
but
because
it
has
definite
known
characteristics
that
those
in
the
marketplace
in
buying
tobacco,
desire
to
have
that
product
when
they
can
identify
it
as
such.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
as
a
definite
type
of
tobacco,
sir.
we
have
--
a
question
of
geography
has
been
quite
involved
in
this
case.
we
submit
here
that
geography
standing
alone
is
not
a
controlling
issue.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
there
is
an
area
of
dispute
there,
your
honor.
we
take
the
position
that
the
federal
government
under
the
federal
tobacco
inspection
act
has
set
up
definite
areas
of
production.
and
the
record
in
this
case
reveals
that
they
will
not
recognize
as
true
to
type
any
tobacco
produced
outside
the
type
--
producing
area.
now
as
to
the
individual
state,
the
type
14,
as
i
mentioned
here,
is
produced
in
the
three
state
area
of
georgia,
florida,
and
alabama
with
the
principal
area
of
production
be
in
georgia.
now,
type
13
is
defined
as
certain
in
areas
of
south
carolina,
then
we
have
type
12
and
11
coming
on
up
north
into
the
virginia
area.
these
areas
are
defined
under
the
federal
tobacco
inspection
act,
and
the
testimony
of
mr.
williams
in
this
record
shows
that
the
department
will
not
recognize
as
true
to
type
any
tobacco
produced
outside
of
that
area.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
florida.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
no,
sir.
that
is
not
true.
we
do
not
--
we
separate
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
no,
sir.
we
put
a
tag.
the
type
14
carried
the
white
tag.
and
again,
type
14,
as
under
our
statute,
would
include
the
tobacco
produced
in
georgia,
florida,
and
alabama.
now,
this
is
one
reason
that
i
made
the
point
that
the
basic
issue
is
the
authority
of
the
state
to
require
the
identification.
we
realized
that
we
might
not
have
utilized
the
best
means
possible
in
carrying
out
the
identification.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
sir,
we
want
the
truth
known
of
at
--
or
the
tobacco
at
the
time
it
is
offered
for
sale.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
we
want
the
truth.
we
want
the
type
known,
and
we
utilize
this,
this
means
of
the
colored
tags.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
we,
sir,
would
place
on
the
marketplace
a
white
tag
upon
of
all
that
tobacco
produced
in
the
states
of
georgia,
florida,
and
alabama
which
is
recognized
as
type
14
under
federal
law.we
would
place
upon
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
well,
right
now
sir,
our
act
has
been
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
(voice
overlap)
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
sir,
we
say
there
is
no
federal
barrier.
we
say
that
if
the
toba
--
federal
tobacco
inspection
act
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
no.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
no,
sir.
they
distinguished
it.
we
placed,
historically,
that
we
have
used
the
white
basket
tickets
on
the
sheet
of
tobacco
that
is
offered
for
sale.
now,
under
the
georgia
act
in
question
here,
we
would
retain
the
white
identification
tag
on
type
14
which
is
your
three
state
areas.
we
would
place
on
other
that
type
14
this
blue
card
which
would
have
in
the
area
provided
for
the
designation
of
type.
it
would
be
blank
where
that
demand,
when
it
was
brought
in
to
the
warehouse,
when
it
was
received
for
weighing
in
the
warehouse,
it
would
be,
at
that
time,
the
producer
would
be
required
to
submit
his
marketing
card
that
then
the
warehouseman
could
place
within
that
grade,
the
appropriate,
the
truth
concerning
the
area
of
production
under
the
federal
stamp.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
much
has
been
said
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
sir.
now
--
but
that
is
the
general
statement
which
is
followed
by
the
specific
statements
defining
the
various
type
areas.
and
we
submit
there
that
you
have
the
11,
12,
and
13
define
the
principal
areas
of
production,
but
then,
when
you
get
to
the
definition
of
type
14
that
--
we
say
that
there
is
certainly
grounds
for
us
to
take
the
position
that
it
can
only
be
produced
in
the
three
state
areas.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
the
savannah
river?
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
your
honor,
that
--
i
might
answer
you
in
this
manner.
drawing
the
--
if
--
if
we
assume
that
the
production
area
in
georgia
were
to
come
up
immediately
to
the
savannah
river
and
the
production
area
in
south
carolina
came
down
to
the
north
side
of
the
savannah
river,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
that
there
--
that
you
couldn't
grow
on
one
side
a
tobacco
of
similar
quality.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
with
--
neither
would
your
honor,
neither
would
the
federal
government
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
--
recognize
that
being
true
to
type
as
to
being
type
14
tobacco.
and
they
are
making
other
point.
there
is
no
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
it's
part
of
this
record,
sir.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
your
honor,
we're
seeking
a
means
of
identification
at
the
marketplace
and
at
the
time
of
sale
to
show
that
product,
the
same
as
we
--
as
you
see
that
california
identifies
its
origin.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
say
that
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
i
say
that
you
can
only
produce
type
14
flue-cured
leaf
tobacco
in
the
states
of
florida,
georgia,
alabama.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
according
to
federal
as
well
as
the
state.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
we
want
to
tag
this
tobacco,
sir,
to
reveal
its
identity.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
at
the
further,
your
honor,
i
will
have
to
answer
you
that
question.
not
avoiding
your
--
i'm
not
avoiding
you
at
all.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
it's
a
question
of
revealing
in
effect,
sir.
it
is
in
--
it
is
preserving
the
identity
of
a
product
that
is
produced
in
those
three
areas
that
has
definite
and
distinct
properties,
and
qualities.
it
is
to
--
designed
to
protect
that
market
by
requiring
that
any
product
that
is
brought
into
that
state
produced
elsewhere
must
be
labeled
to
show
the
truth
as
to
its
origin.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
well,
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
heretofore,
but
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1960
georgia
statute
that
type
was
for
all
purposes
--
all
practical
purposes
determined
by
the
place
of
sale.
now,
there
is
a
reason
why
the
state
of
georgia
had
to
move
in
order
to
protect
its
product.
historically,
type
14
is
the
only
tobacco
that
is
sold
in
loose-leaf
or
tangle-leaf
form.
in
other
words,
we
can
sell
the
tobacco
in
these
three
state
areas,
and
north
of
the
savannah
river,
it
must
be
tied
in
order
to
be
sold,
tied
and
hinged.
now,
many
factors
are
involved,
but
here
are
some
of
the
important
ones.
our
tobacco
produced
--
matures
early.
we
--
the
marketing
season
opens
along
the
latter
part
of
july
of
each
year.
there
is
not
the
times
or
sufficient
time
in
order
to
enable
the
producer
in
georgia
to
tie
his
tobacco
and
get
it
on
the
market
at
--
at
this
early
marketing
date.
now,
this
marketing
date
they
open
up
begin
when
the
new
area
started
in
the
production.
they
move
down
in
order
to
market
it
and
permitted
the
marketing
of
this
tobacco
in
this
tangle-leaf
form
or
loose-leaf
form.
and
then,
while
they
were
selling
them,
they
could
utilize
their
personnel,
the
trained
warehouseman
and
other
personnel
in
there
to
market
this
product.
this
crop
in
georgia,
and
then
use
the
same
personnel
and
move
up
the
production
area
in
an
orderly
manner.
now,
this
--
the
amount
of
loose-leaf
tobacco,
which
is
your
type
14,
was
relatively
fixed,
and
then
we
have
began
--
they
began
the
movement
of
other
than
type
14,
the
carolina
tobacco
to
be
specific,
which
we
say
is
--
under
the
type
13
--
under
the
federal
law
is
type
13,
11,
and
12.
they
initially
began
to
move
the
tobacco
that
could
not
be
processed
or
tied
to
move
this
tobacco
down
into
the
state
of
georgia
and
sell
it.
now,
this
amount
of
tobacco
that
was
brought
into
the
state
remained
fairly
stable
until
we
started
to
getting
more
mobility
and
for
other
reasons.
we
don't
know.
we
had
a
steady
step-up
of
the
tobaccos
that
were
brought
over
into
the
state
of
georgia
to
the
point
that
we
reached
about
22
million
pounds
in
1959.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
it
was,
in
fact,
labeled
type
14,
your
honor,
because
the
warehouseman
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
the
type
--
the
tobacco
was
sold
in
most
instances
by
tag
such
as
--
with
such
a
tag
such
as
this.
it
had
the
word
type
14
placed
on
it.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
this
--
this
was
in
compliance
with
it,
sir.
we
say
that
it
wasn't
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
which
we
say,
sir
--
let
me
--
may
i
answer
you
this
way,
that
if
--
we
say
that
when
if
the
type
13
moved
into
georgia
was
sold
under
the
label
of
type
14,
that
it
was
in
effect
mislabeled,
and
that
its
--
the
truth
concerning
its
identity
was
concealed.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
well,
they
go
back
to
say
that
the
--
all
tobacco
having
a
common
characteristic
should
be
treated
as
one
type.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
you
may
have
purchased
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
without
regard
to
geographic
origin.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
that
is
exactly
what
happened,
your
honor.
this
tobacco
moves,
prior
to
this
act,
it
moved
into
georgia.
it
was
sold
in
loose-leaf
form.
it
was
sold
with
this
type
14
on
them,
notwithstanding
of
fact
that
it
was
grown
and
tied-in
--
in
the
--another
type
area.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
sir,
we
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
sir,
we
say
that
we
want
it
identified
as
to
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
--
the
type
authorized
by
the
federal
law.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
we
want
to
identify
it,
sir,
as
to
type
and
its
origin.
here,
what
--
when
the
georgia
--
when
georgia
enacted
the
statute,
it
was
aware
of
it.
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
was
aware
of
the
federal
classification
as
to
type.
we
purported
or
we
attempt
to
adopt
the
federal
definition
of
type
14
into
the
georgia
act
to
use
it
as
a
means
or
basis
of
identification.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
yes,
sir.
and
we
have
in
this
record,
in
the
record
that
is
before
the
court
found.
we
have
established
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
properties
and
in
the
characteristics
of
this
tobacco,
particularly,
the
alkaloids.
you
start
the
alkaloids
which
is
your
nicotine.
you
start
down
in
the
florida,
you
are
1
to
1.5,
and
by
the
time
we
reached
to
virginia,
we're
up
in
3.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
i
doubt
seriously
if
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
sir,
we
have
--
we
say
here
that
we
have
adopted
the
federal
statute
and
gone
one
step
further
and
that
the
federal
statute
provides
a
means
by
which
these
classes
encloses
the
type
and
grade
might
be
determined.
and
we
have
gone
further
and
said
that
at
the
time
of
sale,
that
tobacco
must
be
identified
as
to
its
type.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
this
is
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
your
honor,
most
of
it
is
south
of
the
altamaha
river.
it's
in
the
southern
section
of
the
state.
there's
five
tobacco
markets
north
of
the
altamaha
river.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
yes
and
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
which
i
have
submitted
here,
your
honor,
on
page
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
we
haven't
asserted
in
their
act.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
no,
sir.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
that
is
true,
sir.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
that's
in
7
cfr
29-1100.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
it's
on
page
8
of
the
brief
of
the
--
of
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
very
beginning,
sir.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
on
page
--
on
the
very
beginning,
sir,
of
type
14
on
the
first
line.
it
had
the
figures
11,
12,
13,
and
14
and
then
says
type
14,
the
type
involved
in
this
case
is
defined
by
the
secretary
as
that
type
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
it
was
stipulated,
sir.
the
one
with
the
stipulation
is
in
here,
and
further
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
sir
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
the
attention
of
the
lower
court,
sir,
in
spite
this
stipulation,
held
that
the
georgia
act
was
in
conflict
with
the
federal
act
in
the
rules
and
regulations.
it
said
we
were
in
direct
conflict
and
that
we
identified
it
--
tobacco
based
solely
upon
the
geographic
area
of
production.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
right
sir.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
they
said
we
--
it
was
in
violation
of
the
federal
law
for
us
to
--
they
said
in
effect
that
we
have
established
another
classification.
that
we
engage
in
another
typing
area
--
typing
scheme
that
was
in
conflict
with
the
federal
act.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
your
honor,
i
might
make
one
other
statement
that
the
act
in
question
here,
the
identification
provisions,
for
one
--
one
portion
of
an
act
that
relates
to
tobacco
warehouses,
the
appellees
in
this
case
complied
with
the
provisions
of
the
act.
they
complied
with
the
licensing
and
bonding,
they
require
--
complied
with
the
holding
date
requirement.
but
they
singled
out
here
the
identification
provision.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
georgia
act
was
authorized
that
we
do
have
the
right
to
identify
the
facts.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
sir,
we
would,
in
support
of
the
proposition,
we'll
use
the
idaho
potatoes,
the
california
oranges,
the
florida
citrus,
and
cases
of
--
like
those.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
record
does
not
support
any
such
statement.
the
complaint
in
this
case
did
not
--
was
not
based
upon
the
fact
that
it
would
receive
a
different
identification
under
the
georgia
law
that
it
would
under
federal
law.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
we
would
--
we
would
have
to
concede
that
that
would
be
a
more
serious
problem,
but
there
is
nothing
here.
there's
no
conflict
shown
in
this
record.
the
disparity
in
price
is
we
say
as
result
of
the
identity
being
made
known
and
its
something
that
the
buyers
themselves
did.
it's
nothing
that
we
did.
we
just
identify
to
reveal
the
truth.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
may
i
--
reserve
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
under
the
georgia
statute,
sir,
we
would
say
that
it
would
be
other
than
type
14
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
we
put
a
blue
one,
but
we
would
say
we
would
do
that
because,
sir,
that
under
the
federal,
it
would
be
type
13.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
it
would
be
a
white,
sir.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
we
stipulated
and
we
agreed
that
there
was
a
disparity
in
price
between
the
tobaccos.
we
said
though
that
the
stip
--
the
difference
could
very
well
--
we
didn't
know
what
the
difference
was,
but
we
--
we
have
to
say
that
it
was
the
buyers.
if
they
knew
what
they
were
buying,
they
were
there
to
buy,
as
this
record
revealed,
they
were
there
to
buy
a
definite
type
of
tobacco
because
of
its
characteristics.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
well,
we
can't
say
that
it
was
because
of
the
color
of
the
tag,
but
the
purpose,
the
of
the
--
of
the
tag,
your
honor,
was
to
put
them
on
notice
that
it
was
not
type
14
tobacco
and
that
he
could
examine
it
himself
to
determine
what
type
it
was.
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
