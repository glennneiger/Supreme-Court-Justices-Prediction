justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
there
differences
in
characteristics
depending
on
state
where
the
type
14
is
grown?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
when
they
can
identify
it,
as
what,
as
grown
only
in
georgia
or
grown
in
north
carolina
or
south
carolina
or
wherever?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
i
want
--
what
i
--
i
know
absolutely
nothing
about
it
or
from
where
it
is,
but
i
gather
that
when
the
federal
government
says
that
this
is
type
14
and
permits
them
all
to
be
legal
and
sold
together,
that
this
is
on
some
basis
of
common
characteristics
of
the
tobacco
without
regard
to
where
it's
grown,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
practical
one
thing
--
what's
the
practical
result
in
this
fight?
as
i
understand
it,
what
this
warehouse
complains
though,
if
type
14
were
grown
into
whether
it's
from
alabama,
georgia
--
or
what's
the
third
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
florida,
it's
all
lumped
together
and
it's
just
sold
at
whatever
price
you
get
for
it.
but
the
under
the
operation
of
your
state
statute,
you
in
effect
segregate
georgia
grown
type
14
from
florida
and
alabama?
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
practical
effect.
don't
you
put
a
different
colored
tag
or
something
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
practical
question
i
think
the
same
one
that
i'm
trying
to
get
at
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
is
this.
am
i
wrong?
i
was
wrong
obviously
that
all
type
14,
without
regard
to
where
it's
from
and
sold
at
the
georgia
warehouses
has
this
special
identification.
now,
this
must
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
distinguish
it
from
other
types.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
must
--
there
must
be
a
dollar
and
cents
difference
from
this,
so
we
wouldn't
have
the
case.
now,
what
--
what
can
you
get
at
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
do
it
so
well
as
a
tobacco
farmer,
tell
us
in
complete
ignorance
why?
why,
if
it's
outside
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
would
suppose
it
had
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
were
any
of
these
marketing
facts
involved
of
the
adoption
of
the
federal
regulations
(inaudible)
that
makes
the
counsel
more
aggressive.
do
you
think
that
you're
talking
about
now
was
--
do
they
underlie
some
of
the
federal
regulations,
these
facts
of
marketing
tobacco?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no
if
you
have
answered
yes
then
i
willing
to
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
before
you
leave
it,
here's
a
language
it
seems
just
lay
one
of
this
long
side
or
the
other,
what
the
federal
regulation
says
this
type
14
is
the
fact
of
produce
principally
in,
the
southern
side
of
georgia
to
some
extent
further
than
alabama.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
the
state
regulation
says
is
that
type
14
is
that
which
is
loosely
or
grown
in
the
traditional
loosely
area
which
consist
of
the
state
of
georgia
and
part
of
alabama.
