justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
that
was
a
simple
thing
that
made
it
rather
complicated,
in
the
first
place,
where
does
this
tobacco
grew,
in
alabama,
in
florida,
in
georgia
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
north
or
southern
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
summary
of
your
argument,
you
present
the
case
which
if
correct,
as
justice
frankfurter
have
suggested,
that
you
make
a
quite
different
case,
the
one
where
you
don't,
that
you
sometimes
state
to
be
the
case.
you
said
the
state
of
georgia
has
decided
to
identify
tobaccos
as
to
the
type
at
the
time
of
sale.
georgia
act
substantially
adopts
the
federal
definition
of
type
14
tobaccos
as
grown
on
the
state
of
georgia,
florida,
and
alabama.
now,
you
argued
then
that
because
you
have
not
changed
the
federal
law,
you
have
not
defied
the
federal
law,
but
you
are
simply
acting
in
harmony
with
it
to
identify
more
clearly
by
saying
it's
the
area
when
they
themselves
have
made
that,
the
standards
for
type
14,
you
say
since
you're
not
in
conflict
with
the
federal
law,
it's
alright.
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now,
that
depends
on
your
showing
as
i
should
make,
first,
that
you
are
not
that
--
the
federal
regulation
does
provide
that
type
14
shall
include
tobacco
which
can
only
be
grown
in
those
three
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
do
not
claim,
do
you,
that
if
--
if
your
--
if
the
federal
regulation
has
said
that
all
tobacco
of
a
type
which
includes
those
four
states,
that
you
have
a
right
to
defy
that
law
in
georgia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did
not
claim
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
depends
altogether
from
your
bases
--
basis
of
your
--
your
argument
on
whether
you
are
right
in
saying
that
the
federal
regulation
as
to
type
14
defines
a
tobacco
that
can
only
be
grown
in
those
areas.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it
is
grown
in
those
areas,
you
say
you're
not
in
conflict
with
it
because
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
you
just
--
have
a
--
statement
to
--
against
the
--
where
it
was
grown
because
that
means
type
14.
now,
where
is
that
regulation,
the
federal
government
if
you
say
that's
only
those
three
states'
tobacco?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
8.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
in
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
do
they
deny
that
that
is
the
federal
regulation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
they
say
then
that
you
are
identifying
that
your
law,
that
since
they
give
that
identification,
is
in
conflict
with
federal
law
if
you
say
they
concede
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
argument
that
--
that
your
action
conflicts
with
theirs.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
has
violated
the
--
it
was
in
conflict
to
the
federal
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
name
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
case
that
you
--
excuse
me
--
has
there
been
any
case
that
you
cite
where
this
court
has
held
where
the
regulations,
agricultural
regulations
of
any
commodity
can
only
apply
to
those
produced
in
one
state
--
that
that
state
can
or
cannot
have
them
labeled
as
coming
from
that
state
and
other
states
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
correct
in
understanding
you
that
by
saying
you
didn't
know
why
it
would
make
that
difference
in
the
virtue
of
prices?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
there's
no
doubt
that
the
one
or
another
as
i
gather
you
argument
in
that
case,
the
buyers
do
not
want
to
pay
as
much
for
the
south
carolina
tobacco
as
they
do
for
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
but
as
i
gathered
from
what
you
said,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
exact
import
of,
they
will
not
pay
you
that
because
it
has
a
blue
tag,
and
a
blue
tag
signifies
to
them
that
it's
coming
from
somewhere
400
or
500
miles
and
that
has
to
be
one
of
the
carolina.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
won't
buy.
now,
may
i
ask
you
--
because
of
your
familiarity
with
tobacco,
i
have
a
recollection
that
--
that
tobacco
grown
in
connecticut,
that
suppose
at
least
by
connecticut
people,
do
you
want
to
know
the
best
tobacco
in
the
world
by
purposes
to
which
they
used
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
may
be
wrong
to
that
state
but
i
believe
it
is,
it
is
connecticut.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
is
required
with
references
--
against
the
regulation
for
them
to
stamp
that,
has
made
and
grown
in
connecticut?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
understand
that.
but
what
i'm
asking
you
is
do
you
know
whether
the
regulations
permit
them
to
label
that
as
connecticut
tobacco,
on
the
basis
that
it
is
a
different
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
get
--
it's
frequently
i
see
oranges
(inaudible)
grown
in
(inaudible)
grown
in
california
or
grown
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
florida?
do
you
know
whether
that
is
in
line
with
the
government's
regulations
or
did
they
forget
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
what
i
am
talking
about
the
federal
government,
does
it
forbid
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
fact,
it
does
refer
to
citrus
fruits,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
do
have
a
statute
which
gives
the
same
agency
considerable
regulatory
power
over
citrus
fruits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
recall
also
getting
some
other
states.
they
advertise
variant
astringents
that
they
grow
in
sun
valley,
some
other
states,
texas
--
pink
grapefruit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
that
the
general
custom
if
you
know
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
recall
that
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
but
the
question
is
of
course
whether
the
collision
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
federal
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
answering
that,
would
you
state
who
hires
the
auctioneer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
particular
warehouse
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
community,
they
have
in
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
not
represent
particular
consumers
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
wholesale
consumers
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
may
i
ask
you
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
said
seven
classes,
how
many
types?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
--
would
you
read
that
sentence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
second
batch.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
you
might
read.
justice
hugo
l.
black
23.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
disturbs
me
that
is
that
here
it
is
--
seems
that
this
covered
under
the
description
of
the
type
because
you
regulate,
which
mr.
justice
harlan
and
all
the
judges
described
that
time
is
being
grown
in
three
states
particularly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
he
says
that
if
in
case
it's
not
done
which
indicates
that
he
sometimes
does
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
he
do
it
for
the
reference
with
connecticut
tobacco?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there's
nothing
unusual
about
the
saying
of
the
types
of
consists
of
tobacco
growing
for
the
particular
geographical
areas.
is
it
--?
--
is
there
anything
unusual
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
--
unless
you
read,
it
is
produced,
here
is
the
local
name
and
type
that
is
not
covered
under
the
description
in
type,
but
it
is
covered
here.
that's
what
is
bothering
me.
may
i
ask
you
if
you
have
been
--
do
you
classify,
is
there
anything
that
shows
your
practice
has
been
to
classify
carolina
tobacco
as
type
14?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
--
i
--
i
--
remember
that,
but
if
you
have
already
given
a
definition
to
a
type
which
limits
it
to
particular
area,
why
would
this
general
statement
effect
that
special
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
one
(voice
overlap)
was
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
tobaccos.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
where
does
the
record
show
that
had
been
the
fact
here
despite
--
despite
this
regulation
which
points
in
my
mind
to
the
other
direction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
know
pardon
me.
the
reason
i'm
asking
this
is
that
--
i
think
it's
nothing
less
common
designating
certain
types
for
the
purpose
to
buy,
coming
from
a
particular
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
uncommon
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
--
that's
what
we
have
to
decide.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
you
include
as
a
type,
the
question
here
is
actually
that
whether
that
is
a
collision,
suppose
you
include
as
a
type
and
just
said
specifically
type
14
shall
include
all
tobacco
grown
in
south
--
certain
name,
some
kind
of
flue
--
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
flue-cured
tobacco,
grown
in
south
georgia
and
alabama
and
florida,
you'll
include
all
that.
that's
all
it
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
it
would
be
--
it
would
conflict
with
that
rule
which
you
permit
to
identify
as
i
suppose
(inaudible)
where
the
only
place
have
grown
in
those
places
that
would
somehow
conflict
constitutionally
with
your
rule
for
the
man
--
for
the
people
who
grow
the
tobacco
in
those
states
put
on
that
grown
in
those
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
assuming
--
i
am
assuming
in
my
question
which
is
an
argued
of
the
point.
i
don't
think
it's
been
argued
precisely
on
it
much.
i'm
assuming
that
your
regulation
says
that
the
type
14
is
the
type
of
tobacco,
flue-cured
tobacco
grown
in
georgia,
alabama
and
florida.
that's
all
it
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
georgia
then
would
violate
the
constitution
by
a
conflict
with
your
regulation,
if
it
said,
“we
want
all
on
our
tobacco
grown
in
georgia,
alabama
and
florida.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
--
even
though
that
was
a
100%
in
harmony
with
what
the
board
had
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
don't
suppose
you'd
called
it
preemption
if
they
will
finally
help
you
to
identify
a
type.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
that's
the
--
that
is
impossible.
that's
--
that's
not
one
problem
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

problem
here
which
i
was
trying
to
find
your
view
on
assuming
that
it
is,
assuming
if
you
specifically
said
as
they
argued
and
in
your
–
(inaudible)
that
you
have
limited
type
14
to
tobacco
grown
on
those
three
states,
is
it
your
position
that
we
should
hold
a
statute
of
georgia
unconstitutional
which
in
addition
to
saying
type
14,
says
grown
in
georgia,
part
of
alabama?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
it
is
but
--
but
i
want
to
find
out
what's
your
views.

justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
the
converse
of
that
true?
couldn't
the
secretary
tomorrow,
whatever
we
decide,
describe
--
re-describe
type
14,
as
has
been
his
practice
to
include
south
and
north
carolina,
and
say
principally
grown
in
alabama,
north
alabama,
georgia,
florida,
north

south
carolina?
justice

black
(inaudible)
wouldn't
it?
justice

black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo

black
i
mean
do
you
think
it
would
destroy
the
--
i
frankly
have
difficulty
at
this
time
in
seeing
that
he
hadn't
described
it
as
--
as
grown
in
those
three
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
why
he
wanted
to
put
other
definitions
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
did
he
construe
it
by
putting
those
names
and
leaving
the
impression
that
it
was
only
grown
in
those
places?
justice
hugo

how
long
has
this
case
been
(voice

how
long
has
this
case
been
litigated?
justice
hugo
l.

why
hasn't
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
whoever
handles
this
corrected
this
plainly
ambiguous
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
say
it
means
one
thing
in
the
language
indicates
to
me,
it
means
another.
why
hasn't
he
corrected
it
so?
why
bring
it
up
here
instead
of
there?
justice
hugo

he
believes
there's
no
ambiguity?
justice

do
you
back
(inaudible)
justice

is
there
evidence
to
the
contrary?
justice

may
i
ask
you
in
connection
with
the
statement
that's
been
made
several
times
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
about
the
price.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
there
was
any
dispute
of
this
statement
made
the
representative
of
this
argument,
i
think
georgia
and
florida
tobacco
has
had
the
reputation
of
being
invest
tobacco
produced
in
the
united
states
in
the
last
five
years.
i
think
that
it's
worldwide.
justice
hugo

and
that
provides
for
judicial
review,
doesn't
it?
