what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
or
the
statement
that
the
solicitor
--
solicitor
general
propose
that
during
the
period
when
two
statutes
were
in
operation,
the
georgia's
and
the
federal
government
that
the
tobacco
was
classified
as
type
14
by
the
federal
government
and
given
a
different
classification
by
the
georgia
government
with
the
result
that
--
it
went
--
they
went
out
to
the
market,
to
the
buyers
and
to
the
sellers,
precisely
the
same
tobacco,
under
two
different
classification,
is
that
correct?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
if
it
did,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
you
were
saying
just
as
we
wrote
yesterday
that
the
presence
of
the
blue
ticket
and
the
white
ticket
on
a
basket
of
tobacco
meant
that
the
basket
sold
for
a
lower
price.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
they
didn't
explain
why
that
is
true?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
federal
act
doesn't
regulate
price,
does
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
this
--
any
of
this
in
the
record?
justice
william
o.
douglas
grade
is
merely
a
subdivision
type?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
how
can
you
say
there's
not
a
conflict
when
the
regulation
says
that
type
14
shall
be
made
regardless
of
geographical
or
--
