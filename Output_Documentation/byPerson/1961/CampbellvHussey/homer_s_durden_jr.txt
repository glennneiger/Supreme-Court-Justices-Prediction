mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
came
up
here
to
argue
as
a
lawyer,
but
i
think
may
we
all
argue
as
tobacco
farmers,
it
just
so
happens
that
all
the
counsel
by
appellees
are
tobacco
farmers.
and
the
blue
tags
you
have
before
you,
were
not
sent
up
with
the
record
although
somewhere
introduced
in
the
trial
of
the
case
through
an
oversight,
they
were
not
made
part
of
the
record,
and
at
the
brief
of
counsel
on
both
sides,
we
would
use
the
blue
tags
and
the
white
tags
in
the
oral
argument,
and
our
aptitude
maybe
have
the
court
in
seeing
the
difference.
it
takes
in
its
call
on
a
blue
tag
over
onto
your
right
hand
side
grade
on
the
blank
line
there.
immediately
before
all
tobacco
is
sold
on
the
tobacco
markets,
official
grader
of
united
states
department
of
agriculture
grades
this
tobacco.
and
he
would
write
the
grade
to
that
particular
pile
of
tobacco
on
that
card,
just
for
example,
we
might
say
that
he
puts
down
that
b6f,
which
is
one
of
the
168
grades.
this
chart,
the
official
schedule
for
loan
by
the
--
the
u.s.
standard
grade,
fresh
to
the
farmers
by
the
warehousemen
and
all,
you'll
notice
about
halfway
down,
your
left-hand
column,
b6f
$46.
that
is
the
loan
value
that
the
government
--
the
stabilization
program
will
make
the
farmer
in
the
event
that
the
tobacco
buyers
don't
bid
that
much
for
it.
they
will
buy
that
tobacco
on
the
government
grade.
of
course,
this
stabilization
program
had
to
buy
practically
all
the
blue
tag
tobacco
that
was
sold
in
georgia
for
those
two
days
operation.
if
the
government
agency
is
willing
to
take
the
tobacco
under
the
loan
value,
based
on
the
government
grade
will
cost
the
tobacco
companies
should
be,
because
eventually,
those
companies
turn
around
and
buy
that
tobacco
from
the
stabilization
program
and
fill
the
demands.
as
to
the
price
deferential,
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
questions
that
was
(inaudible)
some
of
these
gentlemen
for
$18
per
hundred
pounds
difference.
we
don't
know
why
it
happened
but
it
happened,
maybe
it
raised
it
a
lot
to
cover,
but
as
it
pointed
out
in
the
record
on
the
swainsboro
market,
the
first
day,
the
first
11
rows
of
tobacco
that
was
sold
were
georgia
tobacco,
white
tag
tobacco.
i
have
been
following
the
market,
selling
tobacco
from
my
father's
farm
since
1928,
and
several
years
of
(inaudible)
georgia,
that
particular
market
opened
as
good
as
any
market
i've
ever
been
on.
the
first
pile
of
blue
tag
tobacco
that
was
sold
in
swainsboro,
georgia
that
day
was
on
the
11th
row.
i
stationed
myself
at
that
particular
part
of
tobacco
because
we
anticipated
that
there
were
going
to
be
trouble,
and
my
client
had
asked
me
to
be
present.
when
the
tobacco
auctioneers
come
along,
you
probably
seen
the
commercial
to
how
they
conduct
the
sale,
when
the
auctioneer
chant
in
his
unknown
tongue,
the
warehousemen
opens
a
bid,
these
are
the
first
men
who
makes
bid,
then
the
auctioneer
takes
up
his
bid
and
he
turns
the
tobacco
from
r.j.
reynolds
to
liggett
&
myers
american
tobacco
and
trying
to
up
that
bid.
they
spent
about
eight
seconds
on
each
pile
of
tobacco.
each
buyer
has
a
little
signal,
stretch
his
ear,
something
like
that
that
he
and
the
auctioneer
communicate
with
and
a
man
walks
along
and
write
it
on
the
ticket
and
he
will
write
on
the
face
of
that
ticket
44
cents
per
pound
rattles,
put
it
back
on
the
pile
of
tobacco.
that
first
blue
tag
pile
that
was
sold
in
swainsboro
that
day
was
knocked
off
for
$61
a
pound,
that's
a
$61
a
hundred.
that
was
then
4
or
5
cents
of
the
highest
price
that
was
paid
for
--
in
a
tobacco
on
that
market
practically
during
the
whole
season.
65,
66
and
67
were
the
very
best
prices
often.
they
moved
on
to
the
second
pile
of
tobacco
before
the
tobacco
buyer
realized
what
had
happened
that
he
had
bought
a
pile
of
blue
tag
tobacco.
he
stopped
the
sale,
turned
to
the
warehouseman
and
says,
“i
can't
buy
it”.
well,
i
was
standing
by
the
warehouseman
and
he
asked
why.
it's
in
too
high
odor.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
too
high
odor.
now,
odor
is
moisture
content.
if
you
don't
have
it
wet
enough,
tobacco
crackles,
just
like
paper,
just
crumble
like
a
dead
leaf.
if
you
get
it
in
too
high
odor
and
it's
very
absorbent,
it
would
mold
and
rotten.
so
you
must
control
the
humidity
right
to
--
in
a
very,
very
narrow
limit.
i
got
little
bit
confused
out
on
the
facts.
he
turned
to
the
warehousemen
and
said,
“i
can't
buy
it”.
the
warehouseman
asked
him
why,
“because
it's
blue
tag
tobacco”.
he
says,
“that's
right,
blue
tag”.
then,
another
buyer
points
to
him
and
says,
“no,
it's
in
too
high
odor”,
and
that's
when
he
says
“yes,
it
is
in
too
high
odor”,
but
he
did
make
a
statement
first,
“if
blue
tag,
i
can't
buy
it”.
the
warehouseman
turned
to
me
and
said,
“what
do
i
do?”
and
i
said,
“stop
the
sale.
let's
get
the
government
grade
it
back
here
and
have
it
re-grade
it
and
see
if
it
isn't
too
high
odor”.
that
was
done.
the
government
grade
or
re-graded
it,
okayed
it,
and
says
it
is
in
good
order,
a
good
marketable
tobacco,
started
the
sale
up,
couldn't
get
a
bid
on
it
where
it
had
been
$61
a
hundred
pounds,
when
the
blue
tag
showed
up
on
it,
it
worth
nothing.
we
want
for
the
rest
of
that
row.
i
got
in
there
with
the
buyers
and
the
warehouseman,
and
we
could
not
get
a
bid
on
another
pile
of
blue
tag
tobacco
for
the
rest
of
that
row.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
yes,
a
row
is
a
tobacco
warehouse
sir,
it's
a
big
barn-like
structure
and
we
put
out
tobacco
and
rows
on
the
floor,
say
200
baskets
to
a
row,
and
they
start
at
one
in
the
warehouse,
and
they
go
down
in
this
row,
and
then
come
over
to
the
next
row.
they're
simply
was
laid
down
on
the
floor.
there
were
some
30
or
40
baskets
remained
in
that
particular
row
that
they
had
to
bid
on.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
it
came
from
carolina
sir,
i
don't
know
whether
north
or
south
carolina.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
it
was
definitely
out
of
georgia,
those
were
grown
outside
of
georgia.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
yes,
it's
placed
right
on
top
of
the
tobacco.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
oh,
yes.
what
they'd
do
with
those,
we
have
little
sticks
that
are
split,
and
we
stick
this,
keep
this
tag
like
that
and
just
stick
it
on
top
of
the
pile
of
tobacco,
and
it
stays
and
some
of
them
don't
use
the
stick.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
multiple
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
he
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
he
could
see
it,
but
what
happened
was
its
wrapped
before
the
warehouseman,
the
auctioneer
got
to
that
pile
of
tobacco,
they
usually
have
a
little
boy
that
comes
along
and
fix
these
tags
up
and
he
hands
them
to
the
auctioneer,
and
then
passed
down
the
line
to
the
ticket
man,
so
that
during
the
confusion,
all
the
--
they
don't
see
it.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
they
just
see
it
and
that
slight
of
hand
trick
you
might
say.
and
then
when
he
did
realize
it's
blue
tag,
when
it
was
thrown
back
on
the
pile
of
the
tobacco
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
he
saw
it,
then
he
says,
“i
can't
buy
it,
its
blue
tag
tobacco”.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
i
have
my
idea,
sir,
but
i'd
have
to
go
out
of
the
record
and
be
just
my
own
opinion.
i
--
i'd
be
glad
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
very
well,
it's
in
economic
value,
sir.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
that's
exactly
what
it
boils
down
to,
sneaking
on
its
value.
my
friends
will
disagree
with
me.
we
live
in
these
five
warehouse
towns
and
what
is
known
as
the
--
the
newest
bell
or
the
new
bell.
georgia
is
a
new
bell
state.
we've
arguing
for
our
share
of
tobacco
for
my
father
many
years
of
what
it's
worth
as
a
form
of
agriculture
here
in
washington,
and
in-charge
of
the
tobacco
division
and
the
marketing
division.
and
i
remember
sitting
in
as
a
little
high
school
boy
in
campuses
where
he
would
be
arguing
with
these
other
states
about
we
weren't
getting
enough
of
our
tobacco
and
they
were
arguing
we
were
getting
too
much.
so
this
thing
goes
way
back.
in
south
georgia,
down
in
our
whitman
and
douglas
and
down
in
austell,
they
had
their
markets
before
we
get
ours
in
swainsboro
and
statesboro,
our
five
markets,
north
of
altamaha
river
can't
live
on
tobacco
that's
grown
in
that
territory.
we
don't
have
enough
volume
to
survive
in
a
competitive
business
like
tobacco
auction
business.
50%
of
our
tobacco
is
brought
in
from
the
carolinas.
i'm
strictly
out
of
the
record
in
saying
this,
and
i'm
surmising
and
i'll
probably
stand
corrected
by
my
brother
counsel.
but
the
north
carolinian
and
south
carolinian
warehousemen
hated
to
this
north
carolinian
and
south
carolinian
tobacco
going
to
georgia
to
be
sold,
and
they
want
it
stopped.
in
turn,
some
of
our
south
georgia
boys
warehousemen
didn't
care
too
much
about
whether
we
continue
to
operate
or
not
because
if
we
could
not
operate
this
carolina
tobacco,
then
we'd
have
to
do
it
as
i
have
done
many
times
leave
our
farm
and
go
and
spend
two
nights
sleeping
on
a
pile
of
tobacco
truck
waiting
to
get
it
sold.
where
today,
i
can
take
it
in
this
morning
and
get
it
sold
that
afternoon.
as
i
say
gentlemen,
i
went
out
of
the
record
on
that,
and
i'm
sure
that
the
counsel
will
--
take
it
--
accept
this,
to
what
i
have
said.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
thank
you
mr
chief
justice.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
frankly
sir,
i
don't
know
unless
we
go
back
to
the
tobacco
act,
federal
tobacco
inspection
act
in
1935,
the
federal
act,
where
congress
stated
that
without
uniform
standards
of
classification
and
inspection,
the
evaluation
of
tobacco
is
susceptible
to
manipulation,
control,
and
speculation
and
for
that
reason,
it
was
necessary
to
have
regulation
by
a
single
authority.
otherwise,
you
have
undue
fluctuations
in
price
which
would
impose
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce
for
the
sale
of
tobacco.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
oh
no.
but
the
--
where
you
have
dual
regulation
and
we
have
for
the
federal
act
identifying
tobacco
in
one
amount
and
the
georgia
act
identified
in
a
different
manner,
the
conflict
is
what
led
to
what
congress
said
would
happen
undue
fluctuations
in
price
and
i
think
that
that
congress
was
--
you
might
say
looking
in
a
crystal
ball
and
see
and
that
this
would
happen,
it
did
happen
just
like
you
said
it
would.
have
i
answered
the
question
sir?
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
that
was
put
in
part
of
the
federal
act,
sir.
now,
mr.
cohn
is
going
to
handle
the
part
of
the
case
pertaining
to
the
preemption
by
the
federal
government
and
in
his
brief
and
argument,
he
goes
into
the
congressional
record
and
to
debate
from
the
floor
of
congress
where
these
congressmen
expressed
their
feelings
about
the
very
point
that
you
mentioned
sir.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
again,
i
was
speculating
sir.
it's
not
in
the
record.
we
have
no
proof,
but
we
have
a
condition
in
our
tobacco
growers
where
we
have
a
huge
number
of
growers
with
a
small
number
of
purchasers.
those
tobacco
buyers
know
that
where
a
man
hauls
his
tobacco
400
or
500
miles
to
the
market
to
sell
it
that
he
more
or
less
has
to
take
what
they
want
to
give
him
for
it.
it
would
be
prohibited
for
him
to
turn
the
sale
down.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
on
the
tobacco
sales,
the
sale
amount
of
tobacco
is
being
sold,
the
floor
man
would
put
on
the
sheet
the
price
and
the
purchaser's
name
or
seller.
if
i
follow
to
that
sale
and
i
was
not
satisfied
with
that
price,
i
would
turn
that
sale
by
turning
right
there.
when
i
tear
that
tag
that
means
that
i'm
dissatisfied
with
the
price.
i
can
then
take
my
tobacco
up
and
carry
it
by
home.
but
if
i
haul
it
400
or
500
miles,
i
can't.
it
--
it'd
be
prohibited.
so
they
realize
that
they
get
offer
me
whatever
they
want
and
i
more
or
less
got
to
take
it
unless
i
live
locally
where
i
can
turn
it
and
bring
it
back
and
resell
it
tomorrow.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
it
could
happen
sir
except
for
the
fact
that
the
blue
tag
is
spotted
as
being
--
tobacco
has
been
hauled
a
long
distance
and
they
know
just
like
when
i
use
to
have
to
haul
my
tobacco
a
100
to
150
miles
to
south
georgia,
i
--
i
would
have
to
take
a
price
a
lot
of
times
but
i
didn't
want
because
i
couldn't
hold
it
back
to
my
home
and
put
it
on
market
another
time.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
they
do
sir.
they
will,
and
they
did
assign
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
yes.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
connecticut
does
grow
tobacco,
yes
sir.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
oh,
sir
that
is
a
different
type
of
tobacco,
we
are
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
we're
--
we're
dealing
streaker
or
flue-cured
tobacco.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
i
don't
--
i'm
--
(voice
overlap)
flue-cured
tobacco
now.
we
have
burley.
we
have
air-and-sun,
fire-cured
and
various
types
of
tobacco
and
in
my
section
of
the
country
we
grew
flue-cure
tobacco
only.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
yes.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
as
long
as
it
does
not
undue
to
burden
interstate
commerce,
it's
--
it's
perfectly
alright.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
no.
not
that
i
know
of.
so
far
as
i
know,
there
is
nothing
in
federal
statute,
i
--
i
could
--
could
be
mistaken
in
this,
pertaining
to
citrus
fruits,
the
appellant
cited
the
cases
sligh
versus
kirkwood
which
is
a
florida
case,
ruled
that
of
florida
statute,
where
florida
passed
an
act
in
making
a
criminal
offense
to
shift
from
the
state
of
florida
any
citrus
fruits
one-fifth
for
human
consumption
and
this
court
in
passing
on
that
case,
pointed
out
that
they
could
do
that,
that
to
restrict
their
local
in
character
and
that
the
federal
government
had
not
acted
to
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
on
the
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
no
federal
statute
and
of
course
for
that
particular
statute
did
not
restrict,
identify
or
do
anything
to
citrus
fruits
in
california,
citrus
fruits
in
texas
or
any
other
state.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
sir?
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
that
was
florida,
for
citrus
fruit
grown
in
florida.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
well,
we
--
we
--
we
ship
peaches
from
georgia,
georgia
peaches.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
georgia
eggs.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
ship
georgia
poultry,
but
so
long
as
it
does
not
unduly
burden
interstate
commerce,
that's
--
that's
permissible.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
but
if
i
put
all
my
citrus
fruit,
anything
that
would
place
in
embargo
on
citrus
fruit
from
other
states,
i
can't
do
it.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
i
see.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
say
that
the
georgia
act
was
not
local
in
character.
they
placed
an
embargo
on
products
brought
in
from
carolina.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
no,
in
fact,
i
would
either.
but
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
maybe
i
can
explain
it
to
you
mr.
chief
justice
in
this
way.
the
appellants
had
a
doctor
sean,
i
believe
what's
his
name,
who
is
an
agronomist
from
the
clinton
collage,
he's
a
tobacco
specialist
and
he
explained
to
the
trail
court,
that
farther
up
the
belt
you
get
the
different
nicotine
content
that
you'd
find
in
tobacco
as
a
general
rule.
now
there
is
--
there
is
no
set
rule.
in
other
words,
i
could
plant
ten
hectares
tobacco
on
my
farm.
one
side
of
my
field,
i'd
have
a
light
sandy
lawn
soil.
the
other
side,
i
have
what
we
call
a
tipped
and
red
pebble
soil.
well,
the
chemical
characteristics
and
probably
the
nicotine
content
for
the
tobacco
grown
in
the
sandy
lawn
would
be
different
from
other.
there
is
no
uniformity
sir.
it's
for
that
reason
that
this
tobacco
is
aged
for
about
three
years
after
it's
bought
in
the
market.
then
as
in
this
huge
(inaudible),
then
the
chemist
of
the
tobacco
company,
when
they
start
of
manufacture
that
into
cigarette,
they
have
to
get
in
a
sample
of
tobacco
because
you
may
have
(inaudible)
tobacco
just
grown
on
50
different
falls.
and
they
take
that
tobacco
and
run
that
chemical
analysis
on
the
samples
to
see
what
must
be
added
so
that,
they
were
getting
uniformity
of
taste.
as
you
know,
when
you
light
up
a
cigarette,
you
smoke
as
one
cigarette
or
one
cigar,
of
course
we're
not
dealing
with
cigar
tobacco,
which
you
smoke
one
cigarette
because
it
has
a
taste
that
you
like.
and
when
you
light
that
cigarette,
you
expect
to
have
the
same
taste
that
the
previous
cigarette
that
same
brand
have,
so
they
must
have
uniformity.
and
in
order
to
get
that
uniformity,
they
run
this
chemical
test
to
see
what
must
be
added
to
that
tobacco.
and
they
add
licorice,
now
honey,
and
the
other
flavors
that
make
a
camel
cigarette
taste
like
lucky
strike
or
phillip
morris
to
get
that
uniformity.
so,
there
is
--
there
is
nothing
that
you
can
say
that
is
uniformed
by
tobacco.
it's
--
you
might
say
almost
to
carry
an
agent
for
this
attitude
--
added
ingredients.
and
each
brand
of
cigarette
has
a
certain
percentage
of
what
we
call
the
premium
grade
tobacco
and
it
also
had
a
certain
percentage
of
your
rough
trash
you
might
say.
no
one
is
monopolizing
the
--
cream
of
the
crop
you
might
say,
but
they
--
they
blend
that.
it's
a
blend
is
what
it
is.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
maybe
i
can
answer
this
question.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
the
warehouse.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
well
most
of
our
warehouse
sir,
live
in
carolina
because
they
come
that
far
with
short
seller
state.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
oh
no
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
no,
you
may
have
one
auctioneer
that
would
work
for
two
different
warehousemen.
he
--
he
is
an
employee
by
the
warehousemen.
he
gets
a
certain
amount
of
each
basket
of
tobacco
he
auctions
on.
your
question
sir,
i
don't
know
and
i
--
and
i
don't
have
the
proof
of
why
that
first
basket
of
tobacco
sold
for
$61
a
hundred
pound.
and
then
when
it
realized
that
every
blue
tag
tobacco,
they
refused
to
buy
it
at
any
products.
as
you
recall
yesterday,
i
made
the
statement,
that
as
soon
as
that
buyer
realized
that
it
was
a
blue
tag
tobacco
and
he
turned
to
the
warehousemen,
“i
can't
buy,”
why,
because
it's
blue
tag.”
the
next
buyer
(inaudible)
order,
too
much
moisture
content
the
he
said,
“yes
that's
right”
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
we
stopped
the
sale
and
had
the
government
grader
to
come
back
and
regrade
that
part
of
tobacco.
and
he
regraded
it,
certified
that
it's
in
good
order
and
we
tried
to
sell
it
and
we
couldn't
sell
it.
basket
after
basket
after
that,
they
refused
to
bid
anything
on
blue
tag
tobacco.
now,
it
has
been
stipulated
that
as
much
as
$18
a
100
difference
in
the
price
of
blue
tag
tobacco
and
the
white
tag
tobacco.
on
the
first
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
right.
also,
the
(inaudible)
grade
of
carolina
tobacco
by
the
government
grade,
sold
for
less
and
identical
grade
of
carolina
--
or
georgia
tobacco
until
the
blue
tags
are
removed.
and
the
record
will
show
that
after
the
first
two
days,
when
we
got
a
restraining
order,
when
the
judge
collet
signed
a
preliminary
restraining
order
and
the
blue
tags
were
removed
that
the
carolina
tobacco
sold
right
on
par
with
the
georgia
tobacco.
the
price
disparity
disappeared.
they
can
no
longer
pick
it
out.
i
wish
i
had
the
evidence
sir,
to
answer
your
question.
i
don't
have
it,
but
it
is
another
case
of
where
you
have
a
huge
number
of
producers
with
a
small
number
of
purchasers
and
it
could
very
easily
work
into
collusion,
control,
speculation
and
manipulation
just
as
congress
said.
now,
we
were
selling
to
thousands
of
tobacco
buyers.
i
don't
think
we'd
be
here
today.
i'm
not
accusing
the
tobacco
companies
or
anything,
i'm
guessing,
it's
a
must.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
think
mr.
cohn
could
possible
go
to
that
better.
i'd
be
glad
going
to
if
you
would
like
but
we
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
that
--
that
was
surely
congressional
record
that
he
has.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
no
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
they
cannot.
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
sir,
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
see
my
time
has
expired
--
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
--
may
i
answer
the
question?
mr.
homer
s.
durden,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
at
the
trial
in
this
case
before
the
three-judge
federal
court,
i
had
my
client
go
into
warehouse
and
pull
five
samples
of
tobacco.
two
of
those
samples
were
taken
from
a
pile
of
carolina
tobacco.
three
of
those
samples
were
taken
from
pile
of
georgia
tobacco
that
the
government
grader
has
said
was
the
identical
grade
as
far
as
the
government
was
concerned.
as
i
recall,
they
were
grade
b
foil.
i
could
be
wrong
on
that.
every
witness,
including
the
warehousemen
that
we
represented,
the
specialist
in
clinton
college,
the
mr.
nutz
who
was
the
representative
for
the
universal
tobacco
company,
we
would
ask
them
to
pick
out
which
tobacco
came
in
carolina,
which
tobacco
came
from
georgia.
they
could
not
do
it.
now,
the
reason
they
couldn't
do
it
so,
most
of
this
tobacco
that
we've
grown,
see
the
grown
and
gathered
it
in
north
carolina
and
carried
to
south
georgia
where
it's
planted
in
plant
beds
in
the
early
december.
those
have
to
be
kept
under
can,
tobacco
(inaudible)
and
all
up
along
in
march,
these
commercial
plant
growers
sell
their
plants.
they
own
up
five
or
six
inches
high.
in
the
fall
the
buyers
of
those
plants
transplants
that
tobacco.
i
may
buy
a
truck
load
of
tobacco
plants
from
that
farmer,
plant
it
on
my
farm,
under
the
georgia
act,
that's
type
14
tobacco.
from
that
same
plant
bed,
grown
from
their
identical
seed,
a
man
from
north
carolina
may
plant
--
this
type
13
or
type
12
or
type
11,
according
to
where
he
happens
to
replant
it,
it
is
the
same
tobacco.
tobacco
is
nothing
but
a
weed.
now,
these
experts
are
good.
they
can
come
along
on
the
sale
and
they
can
tell
whether
it's
the
looks
or
the
(inaudible)
or
the
tips.
you
see,
tobacco
stock
has
some
20-24
leaves.
the
lower
leaves,
we
call
the
sun
leaves
and
they
can
examine
those.
the
government
graded
can
examine
it
and
tell
you
right
quick.
it's
a
sun
leaves.
then
we
have
our
prime
leaves
which
are
the
middle
leaves
and
they
can
be
--
the
difference
from
those
can
be
told
and
then
we
have
our
tips
which
are
usually
much
small.
so
they
know
the
tobacco.
it
stands
the
reason
at
this
cigarette
company
with
a
millions
of
dollars
invested,
they
have
to
know
tobacco.
and
if
there
was
any
difference
in
the
georgia
grown
tobacco
and
the
carolina
tobacco,
they
would
pick
it
out,
but
they're
just
not.
if
there
is
no
other
question,
my
time
has
run
out.
thank
you.
