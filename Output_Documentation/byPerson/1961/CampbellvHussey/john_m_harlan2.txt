far
as
this
court
(inaudible)
to
your
brief,
as
that

of
flue-cured
tobacco
come,

southern
flue-cured
or
new
belt,
georgia,
florida,

alabama,
produced
consequently
in
the
southern

said,
“we
describe
this
tobacco
in
the
very
words
of

according

but
in
addition,
we
want
a
blue
tag
to
put
on
to
make
it
easier
to
people
to
identify,
would
that
come
in
to
conflict
with
the
federal
regulation?
