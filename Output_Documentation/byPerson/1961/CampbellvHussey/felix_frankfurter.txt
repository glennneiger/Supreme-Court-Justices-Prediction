justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
it
that
the
federal
regulations
require
or
forbid
you
from
doing
that
you
want
to
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
just
be
specific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
you
weren't
labeled
or
flagged
florida
14?
what
is
--
what
is
it
that
you
physically
would
do
if
you
are
allowed
to
do
it
and
what
--
what
is
--
and
why
does
the
federal
government
prevents
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
it
that
the
federal
government
--
why
--
why
can't
you
do
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
what
federal
barrier
is
there
for
you
doing
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
on
from
there,
clear
this
up.
as
i
understood
you
to
say
quite
clearly,
quite
unequivocally,
that
the
federal
government
restricts
the
recognition
of
type
14
to
georgia,
florida,
and
alabama.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
you
say
you
agree
with
that?
you
don't
want
type
14
--
you
don't
what
this
white
thing
to
be
affixed
to
anything
that
doesn't
grow
in
those
three
states.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
--
don't
get
me
to
--
don't
get
a
pity
fellow
like
into
more
agricultural
products
that
you
need
to.
just
clear
this
up
for
me,
as
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
are
--
you
would
simply
want
to
declare
the
truth,
namely,
that
type
14
comes
from
those
three
states
and
you
also
so
that
exactly
what
the
requirement
of
the
federal
government
is,
it
restricts
growth.
explain
--
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
it
restricts
type
14
growth
to
those
--
in
those
geographic
areas,
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
adhere
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
according
to
federal
regulations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
you
want
to
do
is
to
--
to
tag
them
as
coming
from
those
states,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
--
don't
get
into
generality.
do
you
want
type
14
tobacco
to
be
--
to
be
restricted
to
tobacco
coming
from
those
three
areas?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
suggesting
you
are.
this
is
evidently
vague
--
now,
i
don't
understand
anything
about
it.
it's
very
complicated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
but
if
a
stand
makes
the
same
requirement,
namely
that
type
14
can
only
come
from
those
three
sources,
what
is
the
difference
between
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
wouldn't
that
tobacco,
if
it
came
to
south
carolina,
it
couldn't
be
labeled
type
14,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
in
doing
that,
it
disregarded
or
defied
the
federal
regulation,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
was
that
--
was
that
or
was
that
not
in
violation
of
any
federal
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
stuff
that
came
from
south
carolina
labeled
type
14,
was
that
outside
of
the
federal
regulation
requirement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
you
may
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then,
you
are
saying
in
the
answer
you
gave
me,
at
least
you
may
take
--
you
gave
me
otherwise.
it
must
get
out
of
my
mind
that
type
14
by
virtue
of
federal
law
including
regulation
can
only
come
from
those
three
areas.
when
you
tell
me
that,
you
then
tell
me
that
the
federal
government
authorizes
the
south
carolina
stuff
to
labeled
14,
i
can't
reconcile
the
two.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
you
were
enforcing
the
federal
law
and
they
wanted
to
violate
it.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
get
down
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
identify
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
the
federal
government,
suppose
the
department
of
agriculture,
or
the
enforcing
the
authority
of
the
--
of
the
federal
law
explicitly,
leaving
no
room
for
equivocation,
allowed
south
carolina
tobacco
having
certain
constituents
to
be
identified,
to
use
your
word,
as
type
14.
would
you
have
a
case?
have
i
made
my
question
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
federal
government
by
an
appropriate
regulation,
says
tobacco
having
these
constituents
coming
from
georgia,
florida,
alabama
and
--
and
south
carolina,
and
south
carolina,
are
to
be
deemed
type
14,
and
then
the
south
carolina
stuff
moves
into
georgia,
would
you
have
a
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
that's
what
this
case
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
of
course,
your
statute
maybe
bad
even
if
they
did
that
--
abstractly
in
harmony
with
the
federal
law,
as
it
was
said
in
--
what
was
that
case
in
charleston
or
something
or
rather
237
u.s.,
state
statute
may
be
bad
if
it
--
if
it
conforms
to
or
not
merely
conflicts
with
the
federal
statute,
if
the
conformity
itself
in
practical
operation
tries
to
give
some
advantage
for
the
state.
i'm
not
saying
this
is
the
situation.
but
in
all
events,
you
must
first
show
the
kind
of
--
make
a
demonstration
of
justice
black's
inquiry
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
did
the
rest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
too
high?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
row?
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
also
telling
me,
was
the
blue
tag
placed
in
the
basket?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
anybody
could
see
it
with
a
blue
tag.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
asked
you
is
because
you
said
he
did
bought
it
and
then
he
said
he
can't
because
it's
blue
tag.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
see
it.
couldn't
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
see
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he
saw
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
federal
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see
two
different
questions
as
justice
black
has
pointed
out
namely
the
power
of
a
state
in
the
protection
of
health
or
even
the
protection
of
its
local
economy
to
make
provisions
protecting
health
and
furthering
the
local
economy
and
charged
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
commerce
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
am
intrigued,
that's
a
very
different
problem
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
one
whether
it's
a
matter
of
construction,
there
is
a
collision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
our
question
here,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
have
a
very
different
question
if
there
were
no
federal
tobacco
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
same
georgia
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
probably
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wonder
if
you
could
take
two
minutes
of
your
time
to
state
explicitly
and
with
as
much
detail
as
it's
relevant
just
what
the
items
of
collision
are
between
the
federal
act
and
its
implementing
regulations
and
the
legislation
which
you
say
must
fall
because
of
the
overriding
authority
of
that
body
of
federal
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
that
def
--
they're
carrying
out
those
two
definitions
as
the
type
and
grade,
that's
all
pre-determined
before
the
auction
begins?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
--
are
all
the
differences
indeed
in
the
type
and
class
of
the
differences
in
class,
type,
and
grade,
from
seven
to
27
to
a
hundred
and
something,
are
all
those
differences
reflected
in
price?
was
it
a
choice
of
quality,
a
choice
of
preference
within
the
same
price
grading,
within
the
same
price
scheme?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
whether
does
it
--
whether
type
class
two,
grade
30
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
so
on,
the
differences
between
the
grade
and
the
classes,
the
types
and
the
grade,
are
those
differences
functioned
to
the
price?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
be
--
he
may
decide
to
buy
one
grade
out
of
another,
because
of
sheer
profit
just
one
person
may
prefer
--
one
grade
out
to
another
although
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
course
it's
the
same
or
he
may
just
make
a
preference
of
--
as
a
preference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

grade
relationship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
only
been
from
classification
that
the
secretary
has
made
both
as
the
class
--
as
the
class
and
as
the
type
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
grade
has
some
rational
basis
for
the
making,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
rational
classification
may
even
if
it
doesn't
but
it
may
affect
the
buyer
and
the
seller.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
furthermore,
it
is
intended
to
be
uniformed
throughout
the
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cohn,
may
i
take
you
away
from
cases
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
finding
out
exactly
what
is
case
is
about?
and
i
like
to
pursue
justice
black's
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
don't
make
sub
two
things
that
are
different
namely,
(1)
that
the
state
has
added
or
subtracted
or
qualifed
a
requirement
of
federal
law.
that's
one
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
(2),
a
totally
different
problem
even
if
the
state
had
harmoniously
supplemented
the
federal
law
may
do
so.
now
those
are
very
different
three
--
very
different
questions
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
the
clarity
that
has
not
yet
been
conveyed
to
me
at
least
which
this
case
is
has
georgia
done
anything
to
the
regulations,
implementing
the
statute
whereby
it
has
made
in-roads
upon
those
regulations,
either
by
adding
or
subtracting
or
making
a
differentiation
in
the
practical
enforcement
of
what
the
secretary
has
done
and
was
authorized
to
do.
now,
could
you
keep
those
two
separate
and
then
tell
us
what
it
is
we
have
before
us
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
have
the
first
class,
it
is
definable.
you
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
us
exactly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
is
what
the
regulation
said
and
georgia
is
trying
to
take
something
away
from
it
or
add
something
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
added
a
time
though
don't
make
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
if
i
may
cut
in,
has
georgia
negated
that
in
a
slightness
degree
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
georgia
denied
whereas
they're
typing
14
to
stop
then
its
ingredients
and
characteristics
by
the
secretary
is
not
type
14.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you're
right
about
that,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
second
classification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
(voice
overlap),
why
did
you
get
the
second
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
mr.
cohn,
to
disagree
with
you,
imply
that
the
language
is
so
confused
or
that
georgia
determination
either
by
an
appropriate
organ
of
the
administration
or
in
practice
has
negated
on
what
you
said,
otherwise,
you
ought
to
be
able
to
read
and
say,
“yes,
this
is
an
addition
or
a
subtraction”
whichever
it
maybe.
you
seem
to
think
this
is
a
matter
of
controversy
whether
you're
right
on
your
first
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
it
could
have
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
i'm
not
talking
about
lawyer's
arguments.
i'm
talking
about
the
materials
by
which
a
court
must
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
ought
to
be
susceptible
of
more
or
less
easy
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me
what
i
should
read
in
order
to
conclude
that
you're
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
tell
me
what
i
should
read?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
just
give
me
page
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
the
law
court
have
any
trouble
in
reading
it
the
way
you
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
district
court
have
any
trouble
in
reading
it
they
way
you
read
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
language
must
be
singularly
optative.
we
can
quarrel
whether
--
the
government
says
that
two
statutes
are
linguistically
in
conflict,
they're
not
in
conflict.
that
--
that
--
that
doesn't
require
solomon
or
just
any
of
the
desire,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
what
the
government
says.
are
the
materials
there
to
justify
what
it
says?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
the
secretary
couldn't
classify
in
the
type
14?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
do
you
--
and
you
would
--
do
agree
or
do
you
agree
i
just
have
a
slight
to
ask
confliction
and
make
confession
that
--
but
you
suggested
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
regulation
and
section
1
of
your
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
language,
i'm
not
talking
about
what
was
done
under
the
lines
but
that
there
is
a
collision
between
the
secretary
who
defines
type
14
both
not
exclusively,
geographically
but
also
characteristics
of
tobacco
outside
of
those
--
that
territory
and
the
restrictive
geographic
provision
of
section
1.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
no,
principally
to
me
means
principally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
if
there's
minor
situations
where
it
also
exists.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
the
secretary
himself
interpreted
his
definition
of
type
14
to
include
tobacco
grown
outside
of
these
three
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
what
--
in
what
type
of
carolina
tobacco
fall?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
that
the
record
show
that
he
himself
has
--
has
shoved,
has
pigeonhole
carolina
tobacco
into
those
other
types.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what,
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
how
can
we
tell?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
something
so
vital
(voice

is
not
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
comment
on
--
if
you're
good
enough
to
turn
page
160
of
the
opinion,
comment
on
judge
jones'
sentence,
the
last
sentence
of
the
big,
long
paragraph,
“the
testimony
of
the
defendant
establishes
that
in
fact,
tobacco
is
having
the
same
characteristics
since
our
requirement
in
quality,
colors
and
length
maybe
grown
on
both
sides
of
the
boundary
line,
between
georgia
and
south
carolina.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
--
after
the
court
below
said
that
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
dealing
with
the
secretary's
definition
of
characterization
of
type
14,
even
thought
it's
commonly
known
as
produced
principally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore,
that
plainly
is
matter
of
english
needs
scope
including
other
things
within
those
product
line
and
(voice

phrases
and
as
a
matter
of
practice
and
as
a
matter
of
construction,
that's
what
the
--
how
the
secretary
construed
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
properly
draw
the
inference
of
what
you've
said
mr.
groover
that
assuming
you're
right
and
that
--
that
--
and
that
there
is
no
collision
today
and
you're
entitled
to
be
and
you're
right
so
that
we
judge
by
what
was
and
not
what
--
by
what
will
be,
am
i
right
in
saying
that
the
afternoon
that
our
decision
comes
down
reversing
this
case
and
sustaining
use
such
that
it
should
turn
out
to
be,
the
secretary
may
issue
a
new
--
promulgate
a
new
regulation
leaving
no
doubt
on
the
matter
and
you
have
to
stop
at
once?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
suppose
you
