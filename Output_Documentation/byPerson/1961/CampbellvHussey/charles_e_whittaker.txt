justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
it
true,
mr.
harrison,
that
there
was
actually,
at
times,
an
$18
or
hundred
difference
in
price
on
the
tobaccos.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
let
me
ask
you
this.
isn't
it
true
that
this
regulation
29.1096
contains
these
language
--
this
language,
“a
class
is
subdivided
into
types
which
are
“divisions
of
a
class
of
tobacco
having
certain
common
characteristics
and
closely
related
grades,
tobacco
which
has
the
same
characteristics
and
corresponding
qualities,
color,
and
lengths
shall
be
treated
as
one
type,
regardless
of
any
factors
of
historical
or
geographical
nature
which
cannot
be
determined
by
an
examination
of
the
tobacco.”
is
that
right
now?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
thus
--
therefore,
you
were
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
that
type
14
tobacco
cannot
be
grown
in
south
carolina,
right
across
(inaudible)
or
whatever
--
the
savannah
river.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
savannah
river.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
you
wouldn't
put
your
white
tag
on
the
tobacco
grown
in
south
carolina
even
though
it
was
precisely
the
same
goods?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
(voice
overlap)
regard
to
geographical
origin?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
this
really
was
--
do
you
wanted
to
identify
it
as
to
origin,
do
you
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
federal
government
apparently
in
this
regulation
needs
to
identify
the
tobacco
by
its
constituent,
its
characteristics,
color
and
length
“without
regard
to
their
origin,”
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
harrison,
may
i
ask
you
a
couple
of
very
simple
questions?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
tobacco,
otherwise
of
the
length,
color,
the
grade
type
14
came
from
south
carolina
to
this
warehouse.
what
kind
of
--
what
color
tag
would
you
put
on
it
under
the
georgia
statute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
would
you
put
a
white
tag
or
a
blue
tag?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
if
the
same
tobacco
precisely
like
it
came
from
georgia,
what
color
tag
would
you
put
on?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
what's
the
difference
in
price
between
the
blue
and
the
white?
isn't
that
where
the
disparity
came
down
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand
that
the
record
shows
here
or
at
least
the
judge's
opinion
that
about
six
seconds
is
spent
per
pile
in
this
--
in
the
bidding
of
sale.
and
they
determine
whether
they
will
pay
$18
more
or
less
per
hundred
pounds
depending
on
the
color
of
the
tag,
that's
on
the
bundle.
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
can
understand
the
difference
in
putting
a
blue
tag
and
a
white
tag
on,
but
why
would
that
make
any
difference
to
the
buyers
of
the
big
tobacco
companies
when
they
see
the
same
constituencies
and
they
know
what
the
score
is,
why
would
they
knock
down
18
dollars
a
hundred
on
the
same
tobacco
simply
because
it
had
a
blue
tag
on
it,
rather
than
a
white
one?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
does
take
it
home.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
why
couldn't
that
happen
whether
the
basket
had
a
blue
tag
or
a
white
tag?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
must
have
been
some
reason
though
when
they
auctioneer
cane
to
the
first
row,
in
the
first
basket
with
that
had
a
blue
tag
on
it,
there
were
no
bids
at
all.
maybe
it's
not
in
the
record;
maybe
it's
not
important,
i'm
just
curious.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
that's
in
price
--
that's
in
price
but
not
value.
