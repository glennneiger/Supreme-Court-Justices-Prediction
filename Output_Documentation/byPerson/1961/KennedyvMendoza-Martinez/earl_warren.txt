mendoza-martinez.
mr.
davis,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
aren't
you
going
to
give
us
--
tell
us
why
that
isn't
--
why
it
isn't
a
proper
amendment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
when
did
he
leave
the
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1942?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
when
was
the
act
amended
to
apply
to
aliens?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
at
the
time
he
did
leave
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
could
have
only
have
applied
to
a
citizen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
thought
you
said
in
1944.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
amended
1922.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
thought
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
when
amended.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
kennedy,
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
versus
francisco
mendoza-martinez.
mr.
davis,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
two,
robert
f.
kennedy,
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
appellant,
versus.
francisco
mendoza-martinez.
mr.
terris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris,
may
i
ask
you,
if
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
this
man
were
not
a
dual
national?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
administrative
effect
being
given
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
when
he
left
the
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
had
been
a
non-citizen
at
that
time,
had
he
committed
any
offense
by
going?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
draft
evaders
there
were
in
this
country
who
did
not
leave?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
have
any
information
as
to
how
many?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
it
is
important
to
pay
for
a
war
as
it
is
to
fight
it,
and
i
wonder
if
a
man
left
the
country
to
evade
paying
a
million
dollars
or
so
in
taxes
if
he
could
have
his
citizenship
evoked.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
great
difference,
do
you
not
think
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
million
dollars
in
--
and
the
tax
payment
might
be
as
helpful
to
the
government
during
the
war
as
the
services
of
an
eighteen-year-old
draft
evader.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
are
taking
there
about
punishment,
not
about
taken
the
citizenship
away.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
it
an
equally
important
duty
to
pay
your
share
of
taxes
to
win
a
war?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
because
it
was
more
important,
do
you
think
that
makes
a
constitutional
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
thought
you
said,
you
didn't
believe
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
just
wanted
to
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
did
trop
desert
from?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
algeria
and
where
did
he
go,
to
america?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
in
algeria
--
why
wouldn't
that
involve
our
foreign
relations
just
as
much
as
this
mexican
boy
who
went
down
to
a
friendly
nation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wasn't
talking
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wasn't
talking
about
statute,
i
was
talking
about
the
factual
difference
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
made
no
constitutional
distinction
between
him
and
the
person
who
is
not
a
dual
national
and
how
about
the
statelessness
of
the
man
who
is
not
a
dual
national
who
is
in
the
same
circumstances
as
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
so
understood
it
to
be
â€“-
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
constitutional
difference
then?
if
one
is
more
clear
than
the
other
constitutionally
what
is
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
this
was
severe
the
punishment
that
can
be
extended
to
a
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
--
what
is
the
maximum
he
can
be
punished
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
in
this
case
as
in
the
trop
case,
he
could
be
punished
for
leaving
the
county.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
thinks
so,
chairman
russell?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
senator
russell
oppose
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
passed
it,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
the
attorney
general
recommending
that
there
is
mention
on
the
line
of
punishment
or
penalty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
going
to
ask
what
other
countries
do
provide
for
expatriation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
there
are
only
a
few
of
them
that
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
turkey
and
philippines.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
make
the
distinction
--
they
make
the
distinction
between
naturalized
and
native
born?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
1955.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
three,
dean
rusk,
secretary
of
state
appellant
versus
john
henry
cort.
mr.
doolittle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doolittle
just
to
straighten
this
out,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
he
has
the
passport
for
two
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
hasn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
somewhere
along
that
line
and
hasn't
chosen
to
come
back.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then,
i
thought
i
also
understood
you
to
say
just
a
moment
ago
that
he
would
not
be
permitted
to
come
back.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
boudin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
dean
rusk,
secretary
of
state,
appellant,
versus
joseph
henry
cort.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
boudin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
also
a
presumption
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
he
has
to
overcome?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
point
was
that
he
has
in
addition
to
what
you
--
his
burden
would
be
in
an
ordinary
trial,
he
is
required
in
a
proceeding
of
this
kind
to
overcome
a
presumption?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doolittle?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
be
--
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
say
he
was
an
american
because
they
denied
him
a
passport
and
i
suppose
we
wouldn't
be
able
to
say
he
is
an
englishman
because
they
refused
to
let
him
stay
there
any
longer,
what
would
you
suggest
that
he
say
in
there,
when
he
made
this
application
for
a
passport
in
czechoslovakia?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you
mentioned
there
it
was
one
of
the
factors
against
him,
that
he
himself
admitted
he
was
a
stateless
person.
i
was
just
wondering
that
if
that
was
an
irrational
thing
for
him
to
do
in
the
circumstance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
oh
yes,
go
right
in.
