mr.
j.
william
doolittle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
this
is
another
expatriation
case.
appellee
joseph
h.
cort
was
denied
a
passport
by
the
secretary
of
state
on
the
ground
that
he
had
expatriated
himself
under
section
349(a)(10)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
by
remaining
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
in
time
of
national
emergency
for
the
purpose
of
evading
military
service.
when
the
case
was
here
last
spring,
this
court
decided
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
appellee’s
suit
for
a
judgment
declaring
that
he
is
a
citizen
and
enjoining
the
secretary
from
denying
him
a
passport
on
the
ground
that
he
is
not
and
the
court
held
that
section
360
(b)
and
(c)
of
the
act
did
not
provide
the
exclusive
procedure
by
which
he
could
attack
an
administrative
determination
that
he
was
not
a
citizen.
the
court
ordered
the
merits
of
the
case
reargued
and
so
today
there
is
squarely
presented
for
decision
the
constitutionality
of
section
349
(a)(10),
which
is
the
statutory
successor
to
section
401(j)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
whose
constitutionality
is
at
issue
in
the
mendoza-martinez
case
just
argued.
the
facts
are
essentially
undisputed.
cort
was
born
in
boston
in
1927.
on
turning
18
in
1945
he
registered
under
the
regular
selective
service
act
and
shortly
thereafter
was
classified
4(f).
he
later
registered
under
the
universal
training
and
service
act
of
1948
and
under
that
act
was
classified
3(a)
and
subsequently
2(a).
then
he
attended
the
yale
medical
school
from,
which
he
received
the
md
degree
in
1951,
june
1951.
shortly
prior
to
graduation
in
may
1951,
he
registered
under
the
doctors
draft
act.
in
that
same
month,
may
1951,
he
departed
for
england
to
accept
a
research
fellowship
at
the
university
of
cambridge.
in
september
1952,
while
he
was
still
in
england
on
that
fellowship
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
he
was
required
to
obtain
permission.
it
appears
that
there
was
a
little
bit
of
confusion
in
his
mind
at
this
time.
the
time
for
him
to
register
had
not
yet
arrived
when
he
registered.
you
see
he
left
actually
before
graduation,
before
he
was
an
md.
he
got
the
--
he
discussed
the
matter
with
the
local
draft
board,
also
discussed
it
with
the
draft
advisor
at
yale.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
the
problem
that
he
had
and
his
draft
advisor
at
yale,
who
was
a
member
and
the
faculty,
advised
him
that
he
was
sure
this
would
be
all
right
and
at
the
local
board
in
new
haven
with
which
he
had
registered
was
fully
advised.
now
there
is
a
bit
of
a
problem
in
that
he
--
his
registration
was
actually
with
--
his
registration,
his
regular
registration
under
the
regular
draft
was
with
a
board
in
brookline,
massachusetts,
which
was
not
informed
of
this,
but
we
do
not
regard
that
as
bearing
on
his
intention
in
leaving.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
his
departure
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right
your
honor,
we
don't
contend
otherwise.
as
i
say
in
1952
september,
while
he
was
still
in
england,
he
was
classified
by
his
local
board
in
massachusetts
as
1
a
medical.
later
in
that
same
year
he
received
an
offer
of
a
position
as
an
instructor
in
physiology
at
harvard
medical
school.
in
december
of
1952,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
authorities
at
harvard
accepting
the
position
and
indicating
that
he
had
obtained
transportation
to
return
to
massachusetts,
to
the
united
states
in
june
1951,
excuse
me,
in
june
1953
and
that
he
would
be
prepared
to
start
work
in
july
or
august
at
the
medical
school.
on
the
same
day,
he
wrote
to
the
massachusetts
medical
advisory
committee,
which
was
an
organ
that
was
assisting
the
draft
boards
in
their
operations
under
the
doctors'
draft
act.
he
wrote
back
to
the
committee,
requesting
a
deferment
from
military
service
on
the
ground
that
his
teaching
position
at
harvard
would
be
essential.
however,
the
authorities
at
harvard,
after
considering
the
question,
decided
that
the
teaching
position
could
not
be
justified
as
essential
and
they
notified
the
massachusetts
advisory
committee
of
that
fact
and
they
also
notified
mr.
cort.
thereupon
the
advisory
committee
recommended
to
the
selective
service
authorities,
that
cort
be
considered
available
for
active
military
service.
and
in
february
1953,
cort
was
sent
a
notification
by
his
home
draft
board
that
his
request
for
deferment
had
been
rejected
and
ordering
him
to
report
for
a
physical
examination
either
at
home
or
at
an
examining
facility
at
frankfurt
am
main
in
germany.
cort
received
this
order,
but
he
failed
to
obey
it.
during
the
spring
of
1953,
cort
exchanged
several
letters
with
the
authorities
at
harvard
who
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
at
that
time
he
was
in
england
at
cambridge,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
he
was
told
to
report
either
at
home
or
in
germany
for
a
physical
examination.
in
the
spring
of
1953
cort
and
the
authorities
at
harvard
exchanged
several
letters.
the
authorities
at
harvard
noted
the
desperate
need
of
the
military
services
for
physicians
and
explaining
why
they
couldn't
hold
his
position
to
be
essential.
they
suggested
perhaps
he
might
wish
to
seek
a
military
commission.
cort
ended
the
correspondence
with
harvard
in
1953
with
the
statement
that
his
application
for
a
position
would
have
to
remain
on
file.
in
june
1953,
the
local
draft
board
again
ordered
cort
to
report
for
a
physical,
this
time
at
home.
then
in
july
it
ordered
him
to
report
for
a
physical
in
germany.
then
in
august
1953
it
ordered
him
to
report
for
induction
at
home.
cort
received
each
of
these
orders
and
failed
to
obey
each
of
them.
approximately
one
year
later,
in
august
1954,
upon
the
failure
of
the
british
government
to
renew
his
residence
permit,
cort
traveled
to
czechoslovakia
where,
in
his
words,
he
took
political
asylum.
he
did
not
travel
on
a
valid
american
passport
because
his
passport
expired
in
1952
and
he
did
not
get
it
extended.
he
was
admitted
to
czechoslovakia
as
a
stateless
person,
presumably
on
his
own
representation
to
that
effect.
now
later
this
same
year,
1954,
he
was
indicted
in
the
district
of
massachusetts
for
failing
to
report
for
induction
into
the
armed
forces
as
ordered
and
that
indictment
is
still
pending.
on
taking
up
his
residence
in
czechoslovakia,
cort
was
employed
by
the
institute
for
cardiovascular
research,
which
is
an
organ
of
the
ministry
of
health
of
the
czechoslovak
government.
he
lived
in
prague
with
his
wife
and
his
two
children
were
born
in
czechoslovakia
during
that
period.
i
might
note
at
this
point
that
his
two
children
are
american
citizens
and
as
far
as
i
can
determine
not
czechoslovak
citizens.
almost
five
years
later,
in
april
1959,
cort
applied
for
an
american
passport
at
prague.
six
months
later
this
application
was
denied
by
the
state
department
on
the
ground
that
cort
had
expatriated
himself
under
section
349(a)(10)
of
the
1952
act,
and
this
finding
was
affirmed
by
the
department's
passport
board
of
review
after
a
hearing
in
december
1959.
thereupon
cort
instituted
this
suite
against
the
secretary
of
state
for
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
in
march
1960.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
to
hear
his
constitutional
arguments
and
in
october
1960
the
court
issued
its
decision,
in
which
it
held
first,
that
the
government
was
required
to
prove
that
cort
had
committed
an
expatriating
act
by
clear,
convincing
and
unequivocal
evidence.
that
the
government
had
met
that
burden
in
demonstrating
that
cort's
purpose
in
remaining
outside
of
the
united
states
had
been
for
the
purpose
of
evading
military
service.
however,
the
court
held
that
section
349(a)(10)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
is
unconstitutional,
feeling
compelled
so
to
hold
as
a
result
of
this
court's
opinions
in
trop
against
dulles.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
by
the
secretary
of
state.
i
might
add
just
as
a
footnote
before
i
proceed
to
my
argument
that
in
fact
a
passport
was
issued
to
mr.
cort
by
the
state
department,
in
january
1961,
but
he
has
not
yet
returned
to
united
states.
now
we
submit
first
that
there
is
no
question,
but
that
cort
committed
the
act,
that
section
349(a)(10)
makes
an
expatriating
act
and
the
only
factual
issue
as
to
which
there
was
any
disputes,
the
three-judge
district
court
unanimously
found
and
i
quote,
“we
are
convinced
that
his
purpose
was
to
avoid
service
in
the
armed
forces.
the
appellee
does
not
in
his
brief
at
least
seem
seriously
to
challenge
this
finding.”
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
basis
for
challenging
and
as
i
said
in
december
1952,
cort
conveyed
to
the
authorities
at
harvard
his
plans
to
return
including
the
fact
that
he
had
obtained
transportation
to
return.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
it
issued
under
the
requirement
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
we
sought
a
stay
of
that
decision
in
this
court
and
we
were
denied
it,
so
we
were
required
to
issue
him
a
passport.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
its
premise
of
course
on
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
which
we've
been
unable
to
get
a
stay,
which
not
only
requires
us
to
issue
a
passport,
but
declares
him
to
be
a
citizen,
the
department
was
doing
nothing
of
what
it
was
required
to
do.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
almost
two
years
he
is
been
able
to
come.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
she
returned
to
the
united
states
in
i
believe
it
was
1958
perhaps
1959
and
did
negotiate
with
selective
service
authority,
the
department
of
justice
and
state
department
trying
to
workout
something,
actually
with
the
army
as
well
to
perhaps
obtain
him
a
commission
or
something,
but
all
of
this
led
to
nothing.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir
it
is.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right,
for
his
absence
from
the
country.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no
that's
derived
from
his
wife's
citizenship.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir,
but
her
citizenship
alone
is
sufficient
to
acquire
for
them
american
citizenship.
there
are
certain
requirements,
which
i
assume
have
been
fulfilled
in
order
for
this
to
be
the
case.
i
might
say
she
has
to
have
lived
ten
years
in
the
united
states
of
which
five
were
after
the
age
of
14.
now
from
the
fact
of
the
record
that
we
can
tell
about
her,
i'm
quite
sure
that,
that
was
the
case
with
mr.
cort.
i
was
covering
the
--
in
very
summary
form
the
basis
for
the
government's
contention
that
there
is
no
question,
but
that
mr.
cort
did
commit
the
expatriating
act.
as
i
say,
in
december
1952
he
indicated
that
he
had
already
made
plans
and
arrangements
for
transportation
to
return
in
june
1953
and
on
the
same
day,
this
is
the
29th
of
december
in
1952,
knowing
his
service
obligation,
having
been
informed
that
he
was
classified
1
a
medical
he
sought
a
deferment.
now
in
february
1953
when
that
deferment
was
denied
and
he
was
ordered
to
report
when
he
saw
that
he
in
fact
was
going
to
be
called
upon
to
fulfill
his
obligations,
then
suddenly
everything
changed
and
from
then
on
he
made
it
quite
clear
that
he
had
no
intention
whatever
of
coming
back
and
we
submit
that
this
series
of
circumstances
could
not
be
more
clear.
now
he
has
suggested
a
number
of
reasons
why
he
allegedly
remained
in
england.
for
one
thing
he
suggests
that
he
believes
the
--
he
believed
at
that
time
that
the
induction
order
was
not
issued
in
good
faith.
now
we
submit
that
the
circumstances
under
which,
as
he
well
knew
the
induction
order,
or
i
should
say
originally
the
order
to
report
for
a
physical
was
issued,
there
could
be
no
question
of
its
good
faith.
he
had
applied
for
a
deferment
on
the
ground
of
the
essentiality
of
his
perspective
employment.
he
knew
that
the
harvard
authorities
in
good
faith
denied
the
essentiality
of
the
position
and
we
submit
the
procedure
from
there
on
was
so
clearly
regular
that
he
was
then
--
his
deferment
was
denied,
he
was
ordered
to
report.
there
could
be
no
question,
no
serious
questions
as
to
the
good
faith
with
which
the
orders
were
issued.
he
also
contended
that
he
didn't
want
to
go
back
because
he
was
afraid
he
would
persecuted
for
his
political
associations,
but
up
until
the
time
he
received
the
notice
to
report
for
a
physical
examination,
he
intended
to
go
back
whatever
the
consequences
might
be.
he
also
said
that
he
thought
that
his
physical
disabilities
under
which
he
had
originally
been
classified
4f
back
in
1945,
would
be
such
as
to
render
him
ineligible
for
military
service.
however,
he
must
have
known
the
doctors
were
not
being
held
to
as
high
standards
as
others
and
in
any
event
the
best
way
to
find
out
would
have
been
to
report
to
the
physical
and
get
that
determined.
appellee
rests
primarily
on
the
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
which
of
course
is
the
ground
on
which
the
government
brought
the
case
here.
now
this
challenge
presents
substantially
the
same
questions
as
those
involved
in
the
mendoza-martinez
case
because
section
349(a)(10)
is
virtually
identical
to
section
to
401(j)
of
the
1940
act,
slightly
updated
by
the
adding
of
the
air
forces
to
the
land
and
naval
forces.
the
only
notable
difference
is
the
addition
in
1952
of
the
provision
that
if
a
person
failed
to
comply
with
the
compulsory
service
laws
his
absence
from
the
united
states
is
presumed
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
evading
military
service.
however,
that
presumption
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
the
district
court's
decision
was
reached
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
actually
in
the
case
and
the
government
does
not
rely
on
the
presumption
at
all.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
one
way
in
which
this
case
does
differ
from
the
mendoza-martinez
case,
and
that
is
the
fact
that
cort
lacks
alternative
citizenship,
that
is
that
if
he
is
expatriated
under
section
349(a)(10),
he
will
be
without
citizenship
in
any
country.
i
might
note
at
the
outset
that
in
the
government's
view
this
fact
has
no
bearing
on
applicability
of
the
statute,
the
underlying
problem
with
which
the
statute
sought
to
deal
is
present
whether
the
invader
has
alternative
citizenship
or
not,
and
congress
evidenced
no
intention
whatever
in
its
own
deliberations
that
the
statute
should
be
limited
to
one
classification
of
citizens
or
another,
the
benefit
shall
be
of
course
to
citizens
who
are
subject
to
the
draft.
we
do
submit
that
whatever
difference
it
may
make
that
cort
does
not
have
an
alternative
citizenship.
the
difference
is
more
theoretical
than
real
and
it
certainly
is
not
a
difference
of
constitutional
proportions.
whatever
banishment
may
have
involved
in
roman
times,
whatever
outlawry
may
have
involved
in
the
middle
ages,
we
submit
that
there
is
not
the
remotest
basis
for
comparing
those
conditions
with
statelessness
in
the
civilized
world
of
today.
many
studies,
as
both
sides
have
pointed
out,
have
been
made
in
recent
years
on
the
problem
statelessness,
stemming
largely
from
the
problems
of
mass
denationalizations
in
europe,
the
problems
of
refugees
and
what
not.
but
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
these
studies
to
indicate
any
probability
whatsoever
that
persons
who
lose
their
statelessness
--
lose
their
american
citizenship
could
become
stateless
persons,
will
in
fact
suffer
serious
hardship
as
a
results
of
that
stateless.
quite
the
contrary
as
a
result
of
this
increased
interest
in
the
problem
of
statelessness
brought
about
not
because
of
individuals
like
mr.
cort,
but
by
the
problems
of
mass
refugee
migrations,
significant
efforts
have
been
made
by
both
national
governments
and
international
organizations
to
alleviate
such
problems
as
do
remain
in
this
area.
we
submit
that
this
is
where
the
problem
belongs
in
the
political
organs
of
government
and
not
in
courts.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
he
would
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
i
might
say
your
honor,
in
all
candor,
mr.
cort
could
not
come
back.
there
is
a
provision
whereby
a
person
who
has
left
the
country
to
evade
the
draft
is
excludable.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no
citizenship
that
is
true,
that
is
correct,
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
pardon?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
i
don't
know
how
that
could
be
done
your
honor.
he
is
as
i
say
excludable
absolutely
under
the
immigration
law
for
having
left
the
country
to
evade
the
draft.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
sir
presumably.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
--
no
i
should
say
your
honor
if
you
were
allowed
to
come
into
the
country,
i
can't
imagine
the
circumstances,
i
can't
imagine
the
procedures
under
which
he
would
be,
because
as
i
say
he
is
excludable.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
but
if
he
did
come
back
in
to
be
tried,
no
there
would
not
be
a
ground
to
deport
him
because
he
would
have
entered
the
country
legally.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
he
would
be
an
alien
who
could
not
be
deported.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
i
don't
know
any
reason
for
supposing
that
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
and
i
suppose
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
all
of
those.
there
is
no
reason
for
supposing
that
he
wouldn't.
an
alien
is
described
as
one
who
is
not
a
citizen
and
that
perfectly
describes
him.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
he
--
of
course
he
does
not
have
the
privilege
and
immunities
of
the
united
states
citizen.
now
certainly
as
far
as
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
not
quite.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
will
be
two
years
in
january.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
i'm
talking
to
your
honor
--
well
that's
assuming
that
the
government's
position
is
sustained
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
pending
the
litigation
he
--
because
the
stay
of
the
district
court's
order
was
not
granted
by
this
court.
we
had
to
issue
a
passport,
he
could
come
back,
but
i'm
assuming
that
statute
is
valid
and
the
litigation
is
over.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
your
honor
pending
this
litigation
for
all
legal
purposes,
he
is
a
citizen,
he
is
declared
to
be
a
citizen
by
the
district
court
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
stay
that
decision,
so
he
can
come
back
as
a
citizen.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
oh
yes
if
--
that's
right.
if
he
were
allowed
back
in
and
for
purposes
of
participating
in
this
litigation
or
of
serving
a
term
for
draft
evasion,
yes
of
course
he
could
be
legally
admitted
if
that
could
be
accomplished.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
he
would
not
certainly
have
the
protection
of
whatever
rights
some
other
country
had
been
able
to
obtain
for
him.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
as
a
citizen
that's
right.
he
would
have
certainly
some
rights
just
as
a
resident
alien.
that
is
to
say
a
person
who
is
living
in
this
country
who
is
a
resident
alien
is
not
one
who
can
be
treated
with
impunity
by
anyone.
this
court
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
protections
are
--
of
course
he
has
fewer
protections
than
as
a
citizen
has.
now
one
thing
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
so
far
is
mr.
cort
himself
is
concerned
there
is
not
the
vaguest
hint
in
this
record
that
he
is
experiencing
or
would
experience
any
hardship
as
a
result
of
his
status
of
statelessness.
czechoslovakia
admitted
him
eight
years
ago
as
a
stateless
person
and
despite
its
full
awareness
of
his
status.
there
is
no
indication
that
it
has
treated
him
in
any
but
the
most
hospitable
manner.
he
is
at
all
times
held
the
position,
a
responsible
position
in
a
government
research
institute.
he
is
continued
his
very
extensive
writings
in
the
field
of
medical
research.
he
speaks
czech
fluently,
as
well
as
speaking
a
number
of
eastern
european
languages.
he
is
seen
fit
to
have
both
of
his
of
children
born
there.
he
went
almost
five
years
without
seeking
an
american
passport
and
he
has
had
a
passport
for
almost
two
years,
but
has
not
seen
fit
to
exercise
his
rights.
we
submit
that
at
least
as
far
as
mr.
cort
is
concerned
there
is
no
basis
for
supposing
that
statelessness
has
imposed
any
difficulties
upon
him.
but
the
more
important
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
your
honor,
but
what
i
want
to
emphasize
and
what
i
am
discussing
here
is
the
difference
between
statelessness
and
well,
dual
nationality,
a
person
who
has
another
citizenship.
i
am
simply
saying
that,
that
as
far
as
his
situation
is
concerned
it
is
not
significantly
different
from
one
who
had
another
nationality.
indeed,
i
might
point
out
that
the
very
circumstances
that
i
have
cited
to
you
might
very
well
be
taken
to
indicate
that
he
didn't
regard
a
czechoslovakian
citizenship
as
such
a
very
bad
thing
after
all.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
what
i'm
addressing
myself
to
mr.
justice
douglas
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
statelessness
is
in
any
genuine
respect
equivalent
to
be
an
outcast
banishment
and
so
on,
but
more
particularly
whether
it's
significantly
different
from
the
person
who
has
his
citizenship
taken
away
but
has
no
alternative
nationality.
but
the
point
that
you
just
raised
is
equally
applicable
to
both
persons;
one
who
has
no
alternative
nationality
and
one
who
has,
that's
my
point.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
think
we
have
a
fair
basis.
for
example,
mr.
cort's
situation
itself
gives
us
some
basis
for
knowing
that
here
is
one
person
at
least
whose
situation
we
do
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
your
honor,
who
is
to
know
what's
to
be
true
of
anyone
who
has
nationality
in
another
country.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
your
honor,
and
it
also,
it
might
be
very
different
if
he
had
some
other
nationality.
you
see
the
point
that
i
am
addressing
myself
to
is
not
whether
the
nothingness
between
having
an
american
citizenship
and
not
but
having
no
citizenship
and
having
another
non-american
citizenship,
and
for
that
matter
the
united
states
cannot
require
that
other
country
shall
protect
their
citizens
and
assure
them
civil
rights.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
but
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i
would
also
suggest
that
we
have
no
basis
for
knowing
what
would
be
the
status
of
a
dual
national,
who
lost
his
american
citizenship
because
we
can't
require
his
other
nationality
to
protect
him
to
give
him
civil
rights.
he
may
be
just
as
badly
treated
in
the
country
if
his
other
nationality
is
as
a
stateless
person,
we
can't
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
quite
possibly
it's
been
suggested
in
argument
here
that
a
state
--
that
a
person
of
dual
nationality
would
not
look
forward
to
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
would
not
look
forward
to
having
anything
but
my
american
citizenship,
your
honor.
now,
the
second
reason,
and
in
my
view
really
the
most
important
reason
why
statelessness
as
such
cannot
be
said
to
be
an
intolerable
consequence
of
expatriation
and
i
emphasize
that
i
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
if
that's
possible
that
that
would
about
as
bad
as
i
could
imagine.
whatever
the
hardships
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
in
the
case
of
the
man
without
a
country
apparently.
whatever
the
hardships
of
the
status
of
statelessness,
the
important
point
is
that
there
is
no
basis
for
assuming
that
a
stateless
person
need
remain
stateless
indefinitely
against
his
will.
the
most
notable
trend
in
the
nationalization
procedures
of
the
nations
of
the
world
has
been
in
the
direction
of
liberality.
what
this
means
is
that
any
person
who
wishes
to
avoid
statelessness
can
acquire
the
citizenship
of
another
state.
we
have
shown
for
example,
on
page
54
of
our
brief
that
mr.
cort
appears
to
be
fully
eligible
to
acquire
czechoslovak
citizenship
by
naturalization.
the
record
does
indicate
affirmatively
that
he
has
not
applied.
however
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
he
might
be
turned
down,
if
he
did
so.
if
the
day
should
come
when
it
could
be
shown
that
all
doors
to
other
nationalities
were
closed
to
persons
who
lost
their
american
citizenship,
the
argument
of
statelessness
is
a
too
drastic
consequence
that
might
have
some
weight.
as
it
is
we
submit
that
no
one
can
complain
of
the
hardships
of
statelessness
who
could
end
that
status
with
little
difficulty.
now
i
should
like
very
briefly
since
of
course
the
constitutional
questions
involved
in
mendoza-martinez
are
involved
in
this
case,
i
should
like
very
briefly
to
summarize
the
government's
position
in
that
case
--
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
with
the
qualifications,
the
minor
and
inapplicable
qualifications
that
i've
indicated
that's
right
your
honor,
identical.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
as
i
pointed
out
your
honor
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right
your
honor,
but
the
trial
in
this
district
court
was
the
trial
de
novo
and
the
district
court
did
not
rely
on
it.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
pardon?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right.
we
believe
that
the
statute
is
sustainable
as
counsel
in
mendoza-martinez
have
stated
under
three
interrelated
heads
of
government
power;
the
war
power,
the
foreign
relations
power
and
the
inherent
power
of
any
national
government
to
regulate
its
own
citizenship.
we
submit
that
without
doubt
a
departure
from
this
country
to
evade
military
service
in
wartime
raises
the
most
serious
problems,
and
problems
that
are
cognizable
under
the
war
power.
we
believe
that
the
problem
of
the
inequality,
the
gross
inequality
of
treatment
as
between
those
who
risk
their
lives
by
service
and
those
who
sit
out
the
war
from
security
of
a
foreign
shore
is
an
extremely
serious
problem
and
one
that
must
be
dealt
with
by
a
country
deeply
engaged
in
war.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
this
was
in
1953,
i
don't
believe
all
the
shooting
had
stopped
there.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
perhaps
you're
right
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
certainly
we're
not
relying
on
the
precise
situation
that
was
involved
in
this
case.
i'm
of
course
directing
myself
to
the
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
meet.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes.
again,
your
honor
to
repeat
the
argument
of
mr.
terris,
we
believe
that
the
power,
for
example
the
power
of
foreign
affairs
is
an
inherent
power
of
the
government.
we
believe
it's
not
one
that's
to
be
implied
from
anything
in
the
constitutions,
it's
inherent
in
any
country
with
solvency
and
similarly
we
believe
that
the
power
to
regulate
citizenship
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
there
is
nothing,
there
are
no
specific
words
in
the
constitution
covering
the
powers
to
regulate
foreign
affairs,
that's
right
and
that
it
is
justifiable
as
an
inherent
power,
a
power
that
a
sovereign
government
has
to
have
in
order
to
operate
in
the
nation
--
in
a
world
of
sovereign
governance
and
we
submit
similarly
just
as
all
other
countries
recognize
their
own
power
to
regulate
citizenship
in
the
national
government,
in
the
national
state,
that
the
federal
government
of
united
states
has
that
power.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
our
reading
of
the
case
is
notably
the
curtiss-wright
case.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
your
honor
the
constitution
sought
to,
if
you
will,
divide
up
or
allocate
the
powers
that
might
be
allocated
as
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government,
and
our
point
is
that
the
inherent
powers
of
a
sovereign
government
were
never
there
for
division
between
state
and
national
government.
they
are
the
powers
of
a
national
government
and
could
scarcely
be
given
to
states
other
than
sovereign
states.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
not
to
make
treaties
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
pardon?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
that
is
certainly
part
of
the
foreign
affairs
power
your
honor,
but
the
general
foreign
affairs
power,
for
example
the
power
to
make
executive
agreements
and
generally
to
conduct
negotiations
with
foreign
states,
that
had
to
be
considered
as
an
inherent
power
of
any
sovereign
state.
we
submit
that
the
alternatives
available
to
a
congress
wishing
to
deal
with
the
serious
problem
created
by
the
gross
inequality
of
treatment
that
i
refer
to,
forced
congress,
the
exercise
of
the
foreign
affairs
powers
of
the
government
to
adopt
the
alternative
of
expatriation.
the
other
alternatives
as
mr.
terris
has
pointed
out
were
simply
not
acceptable,
would
involve
the
government
in
embroilments
with
other
states
and
that
it
could
not
afford
particularly
in
wartime
and
therefore
that
it
was
reasonable
for
congress
to
adopt
the
procedure
of
expatriation.
as
in
perez
the
termination
of
the
fugitive's
citizenship
terminates
the
problem.
no
more
could
gross
inequality
of
service
as
between
citizens
of
the
united
states
sap
the
morale
and
effectiveness
of
the
nation's
fighting
force,
because
those
who
would
abandon
their
country
no
longer
had
citizenship.
also
as
in
perez,
there
are
elements
of
a
transfer
of
allegiance
in
this
act
of
expatriation;
that
congress
might
quite
reasonably
regulate
under
its
inherent
power
over
citizenship.
here
we
have
a
citizen
abandoning
his
country,
relinquishing
his
allegiance
to
this
country
in
the
time
of
its
greatest
need.
we
have
that
act
and
then
in
addition
we
have
the
act
of
his
interposing
between
himself
and
his
own
country,
the
sovereignty
and
protection
of
another
country
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
a
genuine
transfer
of
allegiance
such
that
congress
clearly
has
the
inherent
power
to
regulate.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
due
process
infirmity
in
dr.
cort's
expatriation.
dr.
cort's
citizenship
was
tried
out
in
a
full
de
novo
judicial
trial.
the
government
had
the
burden
of
proof,
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
had
committed
an
expatriating
act,
and
a
high
burden
it
is;
clear,
convincing
and
unequivocal
evidence
that
does
not
leave
the
issue
in
doubt.
this
is
a
standard
that
is
closely
akin
to
the
criminal
standard
and
we
submit
that
it
fully
satisfies
all
requirements
of
due
process
of
law.
we
submit
too
that
this
act
of
expatriation,
this
provision
making
departure
from
the
country
to
evade
military
service
is
not
a
punitive
act.
we
believe
that
its
independent
derivation
to
meet
a
specific
wartime
problem
bespeaks
its
independent
basis
and
its
independent
regulatory
purpose.
in
fact
i
might
say
that
it
was
introduced
by
the
justice
department
does
not
in
anyway
suggests
that
it
has
a
punitive
basis.
the
attorney
general
is
the
president's
principle
law
officer
and
when
he
introduces
legislation
in
congress
it
cannot
be
said
that
he
is
simply
speaking
for
the
prosecuting
branch
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
not
at
all
your
honor.
nothing
except
as
we've
indicated
to
show
that
it
was
intended
just
to
be
carried
over
into
the
new
statutes,
but
there
is
no
independent
focus
on
it
of
any
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
nothing
like
that
your
honor.
at
issue
of
course
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
and
not
the
wisdom
of
an
act
of
congress.
the
question
is
whether
congress
had
the
power
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
great
moment
and
if
so
whether
it's
selection
of
the
means
for
doing
so
was
within
the
range
of
rational
choice.
we
believe
the
power
and
the
reasonableness
of
congress
in
acting
section
349(a)(10)
are
clear,
but
whatever
doubts
there
maybe
are
we
submit
insufficient
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
constitutionality.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
like
to
cover
one
point
that
is
suggested
by
a
question
of
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
relation
to
my
argument
yesterday
and
that
is
a
point
of
immigration
law.
if
mr.
cort
should
come
back
to
the
united
states
under
the
passport
that
he
has
been
granted,
of
course
he
would
be
illegal
entrant.
there
would
be
no
basis
for
contending
that
he
was
not
a
legal
entrant.
then
if
subsequently
the
district
court's
decision
should
be
overruled,
should
be
reversed
by
this
court,
there
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
then
be
deported
for
any
--
for
being
within
an
excludable
class
when
he
came
into
the
united
states.
now
that
question
has
never
been
decided
by
any
court
as
far
as
we
know.
it
depends
obviously
on
whether
or
not
during
the
period
of
litigation
the
supreme
court's
final
decision
could
have
retroactive
effect,
and
as
i
say
that
question
is
an
open
question.
so
there
is
the
possibility
that
he
could
at
that
point
be
deported
for
having
been
within
an
excludable
class
when
he
entered,
not
for
having
entered
illegally,
but
for
having
been
within
one
of
those
classes
and
of
course
he
would
be
within
at
least
one
excludable
class.
now
i
should
also
like
to
cover
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
pardon
me?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
that's
right
your
honor.
now,
but
what
i
say
is
the
open
question.
it's
whether
or
not
he
could
at
that
point
be
deported
for
having
entered
the
united
states
at
the
time
he
was
within
an
excludable
class.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
it's
clear
that
he
would
be
--
he
was
within
an
excludable
class.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
but
whether
he
would
be
deportable
on
that
ground.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
my
whole
point
your
honor
is
that,
that
question
has
not
been
decided.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
question.
it
is
possible
that
he
would
be
but
we
would
not
be
inclined
to
say
that
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
your
honor,
he
would
be
an
alien,
they
would
certainly
be
free.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
not
at
all,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
now
i'd
like
to
cover
one
other
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
asked,
i
believe
it
was
on
the
basis
for
my
statement
yesterday
that
he
entered
as
a
stateless
--
entered
czechoslovakia
as
a
stateless
person.
that
is
based
upon
page
87
of
the
record,
which
is
a
part
of
his
application
for
a
passport
in
which
he
indicates
that
his
residence
permit
in
czechoslovakia
was
a
residence
permit
as
a
stateless
person.
now
i
would
also
like
to
cover
a
factual
question.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
i'm
--
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
should
have
said
anything
else.
i'm
merely
--
my
statement
yesterday
was
merely
that
he
entered
czechoslovakia
as
a
stateless
person.
i
am
not
attaching
any
morals
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
i'd
say,
i
say
he
knew
he
was
a
stateless
person,
but
that's
all
i
can
say.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
except
insofar
as
czechoslovakia
knew
he
was
stateless
person
and
did
not
treat
him
on
the
ground.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
do
agree
with
it,
your
honor.
now
i'd
like
to
cover
one
other
factual
point
raised
by
mr.
boudin
yesterday,
and
that
is
on
the
question
of
mr.
cort's
purpose
in
remaining
aboard.
it
was
indicated
that
mr.
cort
had
--
if
i
could
just
finish
this
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
it
was
indicated
that
mr.
cort
had
received
a
letter
from
the
authorities
at
harvard
prior
to
his
having
received
a
notice
from
his
draft
board.
now
in
point
of
fact
because
of
the
problems
of
when
letters
reach
one
across
oceans
and
so
on,
it
is
probable
that
a
letter
written
by
harvard
did
reach
mr.
cort
before
his
draft
notice
did.
but
in
point
of
fact
that
letter
from
harvard,
what
it
said
was,
and
this
appears
at
138
of
the
record,
it
said,
“we
have
had
to
deny
your
request
and
we
declare
your
position
essential,
so
you'll
probably
be
drafted.”
well
now
your
honors,
if
that
is
what
made
mr.
cort
decide
to
stay
in
england
rather
than
his
actual
draft
notice,
which
he
received
a
few
days
later,
we
suggest
that
it's
just
as
clear
that
he
remained
in
england
to
evade
the
draft.
we
suggest
that
the
fact
that
he
knew
he
was
--
that
he
heard
that
he
was
going
to
be
drafted
first
from
harvard
rather
than
from
the
selective
service
authorities
doesn't
make
any
very
important
difference
as
far
as
his
own
mental
attitude
is
concerned.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
sir
he
didn't.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
he
would.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
sir.
