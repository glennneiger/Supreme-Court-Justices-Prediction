mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
find
myself
in
the
very
peculiar
position
of
barely
supporting
my
opponent
with
whom
i
have
contested
this
issue
so
long
on
the
first
question
before
us,
because
i
join
with
him
in
asserting
that
this
properly
should
have
been
a
one-judge
court.
in
addition
to
the
contentions
ably
advanced
by
mr.
davis,
may
i
also
inquire
whether
the
true
task
is
not
what
in
excessive
zeal,
i
may
have
included
in
the
prayer
of
the
complaint,
but
rather
what
the
trial
judge
in
his
considered
judgment
put
in
his
judgment.
and,
in
this
particular
case
as
it
happens,
some
of
what
i'm
saying
is
ex
cathedra
now,
the
record
could
easily
be
augmented
to
show
what
i'm
about
to
say.
i
submitted
a
proposed
judgment
which
included
all
of
the
injunctive
relief
which
i
thought
was
proper
in
the
case.
the
united
states
attorney
objected,
citing
a
case
in
our
own
ninth
circuit,
which
i
think
is
relevant
here,
although
i'm
not
sure
i
can
pronounce
it
but
ng
kwock
gee
versus
dulles
221
f.2d
942.
and
the
gist
of
that
case
was
at
the
court,
in
similar
circumstances,
rejected
the
attempt
of
counsel
to
obtain
injunctive
relief.
and
so
in
our
case,
judge
jertberg
wrote
to
us,
and
said
that
he
thought
the
united
states
attorney
was
correct,
and
that
i
have
been
excessively
zealous
perhaps
in
the
drafting
of
my
proposed
judgment,
and
in
his
own
office,
drafted
a
modified
judgment
in
which
he
was
very
careful
to
omit
any
reference
whatever
until
injunctive
relief.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
it
as
221
f.2d
942.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
have
considered
that.
we're
here
for
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we're
here
for
the
third
time.
i
know
that
the
court
has
heard
the
constitutional
contentions
which
are
involved
here
time
and
time
again.
i
earnestly
assert
that
it
is
time
now
to
reach
the
question.
by
saying
that
though
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
might
be,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
another
words,
the
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
if
we
had
had
three-judge.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
could
have
been
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
this
procedure
of
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
rejecting
the
attempt
of
counsel
to
obtain
more
relief
than
the
action
entitled
them
to
happen
in
hall
versus
welch.
i'm
having
to
cite
orally,
because
i
think
your
honor
--
your
honors
understand
that
i
received
a
very
late
communication
concerning
this
question,
just
about
a
day
before
i
left
from
california,
hall
versus
welch
185
f.2d
525.
i
thoroughly
agree
with
mr.
davis
that
the
assertion
of
that
the
word
“injunction”
should
somehow
be
enlarged
by
judicial
construction
to
include
an
action
for
declaratory
relief
simply
because
derivatively
or
contingently,
there
may
also
be
an
impact
on
federal
officers.
i
think
that
assertion
is
entirely
correct
and
i
concur
with
them
in
it.
i
have
looked
at
the
f.2d
reports
on
trop
and
perez,
and
it
does
not
appear
clearly
whether
injunctive
relief
was
sought,
but
it
does
seem
quite
clear
that
a
single-judge
sat
in
both
cases.
and
i
would
urge
again
that
what
is
really
determinative
here
is
not
what
counsel
sought,
but
what
the
court
gave.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i'm
certainly
bound
by
it,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
it
doesn't.
thank
you.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
we
could
think
of
it
this
way,
in
terms
of
different
counts
of
the
same
complaint.
a
court
can
reasonably
assume
jurisdiction
of
a
particular
count
and
try
it
and
validly
try
it
and
reject
taking
jurisdiction
over
another
count
and
there
would
be
no
essential
difference
between
that
and
what
has
happened
here.
i
know
that
the
hour
is
late.
i
believe
that
the
constitutional
issues
have
been
exhaustedly
briefed,
but
i
would
like
to
speak
on
the
other
nonconstitutional
issue
which
has
emerged
from
the
court
sua
sponte,
and
that
is
this
question
of
collateral
estoppel.
the
solicitor
general
has,
in
my
opinion,
avoided
the
essential
question
here
with
almost
unbelievable
deafness.
there
is
a
basic
fact
before
the
court
which
is
agreed
upon
and
stipulated,
too.
and
that
is,
that
in
1944,
when
this
section
401
(j)
was
passed,
mendoza
was
a
nonresident
alien.
he
was
in
mexico,
because
he
had
gone
there
in
1942.
now,
when
judge
yankwich
of
our
southern
district
subsequently
tried
him
and
found
him
guilty,
he
found
him
guilty
of
a
continuing
offense
not
from
1942
to
1944
on
this
statute
would
have
made
him
a
nonresident
alien,
and
thus,
not
open
to
or
rather
available
for
selective
service.
but
judge
jertberg
found
him
guilty
of
a
continuing
offense
from
1942
until
1946.
and
i
assert
in
closing
if
the
court
please,
it's
says
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
he
pleaded
guilty
to
it,
and
if
that
constitutes
an
admission,
i
can't
imagine
in
what
context
it
constitutes
an
admission.
because
the
judgment
of
conviction
made
after
all
of
the
proceedings
where
true,
reincorporated
the
same
finding,
is
it
hypertechnical?
is
this
is
a
piece
of
logic
that
has
no
real
flesh
and
blood
significance?
judge
jertberg
had
to
decide
the
extent
of
punishment
for
a
man
who
had
committed
an
offense
over
a
given
period
of
time.
if
it
had
been
two
years
instead
of
four
years,
i
urge
that
it
is
a
reasonable
and
proper
inference
that
he
would
have
taken
a
lesser
period
of
time
into
consideration.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california,
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1252,
which
provides
for
the
direct
appeal
--
for
direct
appeal
to
this
court
when
a
federal
statute
has
been
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
facts
in
this
case
have
been
stipulated
and
are
entirely
undisputed.
respondent
was
born
in
united
states
in
1922,
and
thereby
became
the
citizen
of
the
united
states.
he
was
at
the
same
time
a
citizen
of
mexico,
because
both
of
his
parents
were
mexican
citizens
and
he
is
until
this
day
still
a
national
citizen
of
mexico.
respondent
registered
for
the
draft
in
california.
in
the
fall
of
1942,
he
left
the
united
states
for
mexico
as
the
stipulation
in
this
case
states
for
the
sole
purpose
of
evading
and
avoiding
training
and
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
the
stipulation
further
states
the
respondent
remained
in
mexico
until
november
1,
1946,
for
the
same
purpose,
stipulation
is
on
pages
33
to
34
of
the
record.
meanwhile,
on
september
27,
1944
congress
enacted
section
401(j)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
which
provides
for
the
expatriation
of
any
citizen
departing
from
or
remaining
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
in
time
of
war
or
during
a
period
declared
by
the
president
to
be
a
period
of
national
emergency,
for
the
purpose
of
evading
or
avoiding
training
and
service
in
the
land
or
naval
forces
of
the
united
states.
and
after
respondent
returned
to
united
states
in
1946,
he
pleaded
guilty
to
draft
evasion
in
1947,
and
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
a
year
and
a
day.
deportation
proceedings
were
then
brought
against
respondent
on
the
ground
that
he
had
expatriated
himself,
and
he
voluntarily
returned
to
mexico.
respondent
re-entered
the
united
states
in
1952,
and
new
deportation
proceedings
were
brought
against
him.
after
he
was
ordered
deported
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
dismissed
his
appeal
he
brought
this
action
to
have
himself
declared
an
american
citizen
on
the
ground
of
section
401(j)
was
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
found
that
respondent
came
within
the
terms
of
section
401(j),
because
he
had
remained
abroad
after
the
passage
of
the
act
with
a
purpose
of
evading
the
draft.
the
district
court
further
found
that
the
statute
was
constitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
and
the
respondent
petitioned
this
court
for
certiorari
in
1956.
the
case
was
held
for
almost
two
years
pending
the
determination
by
this
court
of
perez
versus
brownell,
and
trop
v.
dulles.
as
is
this
court
remembers
in
the
perez
case,
this
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
section
401(e)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
a
statute
which
provided
for
the
expatriation
of
american
citizens
who
voted
in
foreign
elections.
in
the
trop
case
this
court
held
that
section
401(g)
of
the
nationality
act
was
unconstitutional,
a
statute
which
provided
for
the
expatriation
of
deserters
in
war
time,
although
there
was
no
majority
opinion
for
the
court.
the
case
--
this
case
mendoza-martinez
case
was
then
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
trop
case,
this
court’s
decision
in
the
trop
case.
the
district
court
this
time
held
that
section
401(j)
was
unconstitutional,
because
it
believed
that
the
trop
case
was
controlling.
the
case
again
came
to
this
court,
it
was
argued
and
this
court
sua
sponte
remanded
the
case
again
to
the
district
court
for
consideration
whether
the
government
was
collaterally
estopped
from
asserting
that
respondent
had
expatriated
himself
because
of
respondent's
1947
conviction
for
draft
evasion.
on
remand
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
no
collateral
estoppel
and
reasserted
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
this
court
then
noted
the
probable
jurisdiction.
the
case
was
argued
last
spring
and
then
set
for
re-argument
in
this
term.
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
we
think
the
statute
is
constitutional
as
applied
both
to
dual
nationals
and
to
stateless
persons.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
the
administrative
effect
in
that
and
mr.
cort
was
involved
in
the
next
case
to
be
argued
here
today
is
a
stateless
person.
however
we
think
that
at
the
very
least
this
applied
to
dual
nationals
is
constitutional,
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
very
strongly,
we
think
it's
constitution
as
applied
to
all
american
citizens.
as
i
mentioned
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case.
there
is
first
the
non-constitutional
issue;
whether
respondent's
1947
conviction
for
draft
evasion
has
a
collateral
estoppel
effect
in
this
litigation.
and
the
second
and
the
constitutional
issue,
which
the
government
appealed
to
this
court
is
whether
section
401(j)
is
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
turning
first
to
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel;
the
basic
principal
of
collateral
estoppel
was
that
parties
are
bound
in
subsequent
litigation
involving
a
different
basic
cause
of
action
as
to
a
fact
which
has
been
explicitly
determined
or
at
least
necessarily
determined
in
the
prior
litigation
between
the
same
parties.
and
this
is
significantly
different
than
the
principles
of
res
judicata
for
that
principle
bars
entirely
the
prosecution
of
a
second
action,
based
upon
the
same
claim
as
an
earlier
litigation
and
applies
not
only
to
issues
which
are
actually
litigated,
but
as
to
any
issue
which
could
have
been
litigated.
now
applying
the
principles
of
collateral
estoppel
here,
we
submit
that
there
is
not
a
slightest
doubt
that
the
issue
of
respondent's
citizenship
was
not
actually
litigated
and
determined
in
the
1947
conviction
of
respondent
for
draft
evasion.
respondent
pleaded
guilty
to
the
first
count
of
the
three
count
indictment
and
that
count
states
and
the
indictment
is
on
pages
24
to
26
of
the
record,
that
count
states
the
respondent
was
a
male
person
within
the
class
made
subject
to
selective
service.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
was
not
a
citizen
at
the
time
he
was
convicted,
that's
right
your
honor.
but
our
argument
is
--
just
about
say
section
3,
first
of
all
our
answer
to
that
and
i
will
come
a
little
more
fully
to
it
in
a
minute,
is
that
his
liability
under
the
statute
came
when
he
violated
the
draft
act.
now
he
may
not
have
continued
to
be
liable
in
1947,
that
--
it's
not
important
whether
he
was
liable
at
the
time
he
was
convicted,
it's
important
whether
he
was
liable
under
the
act
at
the
time
he
committed
the
offense.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
that
when
he
left
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
probably
yes
your
honor
because
section
3
of
the
selective
service
act
makes
the
act
applicable
both
to
citizens
and
to
resident
aliens
alike.
so
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
not
at
the
time
he
left
the
--
not
at
the
time
he
left
the
country.
he
was
at
least
a
--
he
was
at
least
a
resident
up
until
the
time
he
left
the
country.
now
he
may
have
continued
to
be
a
resident
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
we
think
there
is
no
collateral
estoppel
here.
the
fact
that
he
was
outside
the
united
states
does
not
establish
that
he
was
no
longer
a
resident.
for
example,
for
all
we
know
he
may
have
continued
to
have
a
house
here.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
either
in
this
case
or
in
the
1947
conviction
as
to
any
facts
which
show
that
he
gave
up
residence
in
the
united
states.
residence
would
depend
upon
a
whole
serious
of
facts
such
as
whether
he
established
a
home
in
mexico,
as
opposed
to
traveling
around
and
similar
evidence.
so
we
don't
--
so
even
if
he
had
not
been
a
citizen
in
19
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
lost
--
he
did
not
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no
your
honor.
i
think
maybe
i
misspoke
to
chief
justice.
he
did
not
lose
his
citizenship
when
he
left
the
country
because
section
401(j)
was
not
in
effect
at
that
time.
if
it
had
been
in
effect,
he
would
have
lost
his
citizenship
at
that
time.
but
section
401(j)
was
not
passed
until
september
27,
1944.
he
had
been
outside
the
country
approximately
two
years
at
that
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
when
he
continued
to
remain
outside
the
country
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
was
from
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
under
--
in
our
view,
he
was
not
a
citizen
from
the
date
of
the
act
until
today,
but
through
the
period
that
the
indictment
covered
which
is
until
november
1,
1946
which
is
the
relevant
period.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
was
convicted
in
1947.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
was
not
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
we
don't
know
where
he
was
residing,
he
was
in
the.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
the
record
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
we
don't
know
where
he
is
a
resident,
the
record
is
entirely
silent
where
he
was
a
resident.
all
we
know
was,
he
was
in
mexico.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
rightly.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
because
it's
not
important
whether
he
was
liable
--
whether
he
was
liable
for
continued
service
under
the
act
at
the
time
he
was
convicted.
the
question
was
whether
he
was
liable
for
service
at
the
time
he
committed
the
acts
that
are
of
the
subject
of
the
indictment.
he
committed
--
he
violated
the
selective
service
act
by
leaving
the
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
i'm
talking
about
the
selective
service
act,
he
violated
in
1942,
when
he
left
the
country,
failed
to
report
for
induction.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
that's
when
he
violated
the
selective
service
act.
he
was
expatriated
in
1944
when
the
act,
when
the
expatriation
act
was
passed.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
may
i
answer
that?
we
have
two
answers
to
that
your
honor,
even
assuming
that,
that
was
the
gist
of
count
one,
that
was
an
important
part
of
count
one,
there
still
would
be
no
collateral
estoppel
because
there
is
nothing
there
that
indicates
he
was
either
--
that
he
was
a
citizen,
continued
to
be
a
citizen,
that
is
--
that
cannot
be
ascertained
from
count
one.
you
know
from
the
conviction
in
count
one
assuming
that,
that
part
of
the
count
has
--
is
a
real
part
of
the
allegations.
you
can
tell
from
that
allegation
that
he
was
either
a
citizen
or
not
--
or
a
resident
alien
from
1942
until
1946.
there
is
no
indication,
that
he
was
a
citizen
as
opposed
to
a
resident
alien
and
as
i
say
the
record
before
the
district
court
was
entirely
silent.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
correct
but
he
may
well
have
been
for
all
the
district
court
knew
a
resident
alien.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
then
our
answer
is
assuming
that
there
was
clear
evidence
before
the
district
court
that
he
was
a
non-resident
alien,
so
that
you
--
then
our
answer
is,
that
count
one,
to
me
the
gist
of
the
allegation
in
count
one
is
he
violated
that
selective
service
act
by
leaving
the
country.
now
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
1942
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
the
remaining
in
the
country
was
to
be
considered
surplusage
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
think
this
is
true
is
that
count
one
does
not
say
that
he
remained
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft,
which
would
be
required
if
that
was
one
of
the
allegations
on
which
he
was
convicted
in
contrast
to
saying
that
he
left
the
country
for
evade
--
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft.
so
it
appears
that
all
this
is
a
statement
as
to
the
events
that
he
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
draft
act
and
he
continued
not
to
meet
those
requirements.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
issue
of
constitutionality
of
section
401(j),
which
is
the
issue
on
which
the
government
appealed
to
this
court.
i
like
to
break
this
issue
into
two
parts.
first
i'd
like
to
discuss
whether
there
was
any
source
of
substantive
power
in
the
constitution
on
which
this
statute
may
be
based.
second
after
showing,
we
believe
that
such
a
power
does
exist,
i
will
discuss
whether
either
the
limitations
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
or
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
restricts
congress,
prevents
congress
from
exercising
its
substitutive
powers.
but
before
discussing
these
broad
issues
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
two
basic
principles
underlying
the
government's
entire
argument.
the
first
principle
is
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
there
is
an
extremely
strong
presumption
that
any
statute
which
has
been
passed
by
congress
is
a
coordinate
branch
of
the
federal
government,
that
such
a
statute
is
constitutional.
and
the
second
principle
is
that
a
constitutionality
of
a
statute
depends
not
on
any
views
as
to
its
prudence
or
to
its
wisdom,
but
on
whether
congress
had
the
constitutional
power
to
pass
it.
as
to
the
substantive
power
of
congress
to
pass
section
401(j),
in
the
perez
case
which
this
court
decided
less
than
five
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
congress
has
the
power
to
expatriate
american
citizens.
the
standard
laid
down
by
the
court
for
testing
such
a
statute
was
that
a
rational
nexus
must
exist
between
the
content
of
the
specific
power
in
congress
and
the
action
of
congress
in
carrying
that
power
into
execution
or
stating
this
same
thought
in
terms
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
of
article
one
of
the
constitution.
the
question
is
whether
the
particular
statute
is
necessary
and
proper
for
carrying
into
execution
powers
vested
by
this
constitution
in
the
government
of
the
united
states?
the
government
believes
the
section
401(j)
has
a
rational
nexus
and
is
necessary
and
proper
to
three
powers
conferred
on
congress
by
the
constitution,
the
war
power,
the
power
over
foreign
affairs
and
the
inherent
power
of
every
sovereign
nation
over
its
own
citizenship.
we
think
it
needs
extremely
little
demonstration
that
congress
has
broad
authority
under
the
war
power
to
legislate
concerning
the
draft,
more
broadly
concerning
recruitment
of
men
in
periods
of
war
or
national
emergency,
which
is
the
only
period
which
section
401(j)
covers.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
makes
clear
that
both
the
executive
branch
and
congress
were
vitally
concerned
during
world
war
ii
with
the
loss
of
manpower
through
citizens
leaving
the
country
to
evade
the
draft.
attorney
general
bill
told
congress,
and
this
is
the
letter
which
underlies
this
statute,
that
over
800
draft
evaders
had
left
the
united
states
for
mexico
by
1944
from
the
western
district
of
texas
alone.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
don't
have
those.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
the
800
as
i
say
came
from
one
district,
i
assume
that
district
was
probably
the
one
in
which
the
most
had
–-
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
but
this
was
only
one
district
along
the
border,
but
i
assume
that
was
probably
the
district
which
was
the
largest.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
not
too
knowledgeable
about
passport
requirements,
but
i
don't
think
you
need
a
passport
even
during
the
war
to
get
into
either
canada
or
mexico.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
well
i
think
it
was
mainly
to
canada
and
mexico,
that
was
the
main
problem.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
was
only
a
few
thousand
people
at
most
that
were
--
that
were
probably
involved
under
this.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
your
honor.
i
want
to
emphasize
and
i'll
come
back
to
this
probably
several
times
during
my
argument.
we
think
there
is
a
very
sharp
distinction
between
draft
evaders
in
this
country
who
just
evade
the
draft
and
stay
within
our
jurisdiction
and
those
who
go
to
a
foreign
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
i'm
certain
i
could
get
the
figures
as
to
the
number
of
draft
evaders.
i
do
not
have
any
at
this
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor
we
think
that
there
is
sharp
difference.
we
think
that
the
loss
of
thousands
of
potential
soldiers
in
this
way
is
directly
relevant
to
the
war
power,
not
only
because
of
the
loss
of
manpower,
but
also
because
such
wholesale
escape
from
the
draft
is
seriously
unfair
to
the
millions
of
other
americans
who
serve
their
country
in
war
and
this
resulting
any
quality
of
sacrifice
we
think
could
well
lead
to
the
sapping
of
morale
both
in
the
armed
forces
and
in
the
public
generally.
now
the
government's
possible
alternatives
for
meeting
this
serious
problem
were
extremely
few.
draft
evaders
leaving
the
country
could
not
be
punished
because
they
were
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
the
extradition
treaty
with
mexico
like
most,
if
not
all
other
american
extradition
treaties,
did
not
and
does
not
provide
for
the
extradition
of
draft
evaders.
therefore
the
government
would
have
been
required
to
make
representations
or
even
put
on
pressure
on
mexico
and
other
foreign
countries
in
order
to
secure
the
return
of
the
draft
evaders
who
had
fled
to
them.
at
the
same
time,
the
draft
evaders
were
necessarily
looking
to
the
countries
where
they
have
taken
refuge
for
protection.
as
a
result,
we
submit
that
the
united
states
and
other
countries
particularly
mexico
were
likely
to
be
drawn
into
serious
conflict.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
the
only
difference
between
what
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
that
possible
statute
and
the
actual
statute
was
that
there
was
no
notice
specifically
given
to
each
individual
draft
evader.
however,
i
think
there
can
be
a
very
little
doubt
under
this
court's
decisions
if
that
distinction
does
not
make
a
constitutional
difference.
there
is
no
indication
in
mackenzie
case
and
the
savorgnan
case
where
this
court
held
that
a
person
had
been
expatriated,
it
was
admitted
--
at
the
district
court
unfounded
it
and
was
therefore
assumed
in
this
court
that
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
but
i'm
saying
that
for
constitutional
purposes,
we'll
be
here
with
the
same
case
if
congress
would
pass
that
statute.
that
statute
would
also
have
involved
probably
considerable
problems
with
trying
to
locate
people
in
another
country
and
in
itself
might
have
given
rise
to
conflicts
with
the
other
countries.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
the
government
emphasized
it
very
strong
and
we
do
not
think
that
they
fall
into
the
same
category
and
this
court
has
quite
cleanly
emphasized
in
the
number
of
cases
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
not
trying
to
make
any
comparison
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
think
it's
extremely
important.
i
would
come
back
to
what
this
court
said
in
the
selective
service
cases
that
service
in
the
armed
forces
is
a
supreme
and
noble
duty
of
every
american
citizen.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
think
that
statements
only
meant
to
be
what
is
the
duty?
now
it
happens
that
case
went
onto
discuss
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
suppose
it
--
you
can
get
it,
you
can
get
little
more
values
here.
i
would
submit
and
i
think
that
the
cases
of
this
court
indicate
that
service
in
the
armed
forces
in
times
of
national
emergency
is
a
more
important
duty.
now,
i
would
argue
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
would
--
that
congress
could
take
away
citizenship
for
persons
not
paying
their
taxes
and
leaving
the
country
in
time
of
war
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
did.
i
think
congress
has
that
power.
i
think
that
this
is
a
clearer
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
i
think
that
i
--
we
believe
the
congress
has
this
power.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
think
that
the
possibilities
of
conflict
with
foreign
nations
is
increased
when
many
draft
evaders
seek
the
same
country
as
the
place
of
refuge
and
of
course
as
i
have
indicated
this
is
exactly
what
section
401(j)
was
intended
to
meet,
this
was
the
underlying
problem.
most
of
these
people
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
indicated
went
to
one
or
two
countries
and
in
addition
the
country
--
the
possibilities
of
conflict
were
increased
even
more
because
the
statute
mainly
applied
to
dual
nationals
and
of
course,
the
countries
of
refuge
would
almost
automatically
protect
their
own
citizens
as
we
have
frequently
done
in
similar
situations.
now
the
immigration
service
figured
show
that
section
401(j)
is
mainly
applied
to
dual
nationals
and
mainly
to
mexicans,
because
every
litigated
case
as
far
as
we
know
with
the
exception
of
the
court
case
as
i've
indicated
will
be
argued
next
has
involved
a
dual
national.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
you
mean
we
can
just
do
nothing.
your
honor,
we
don't
--
we
did
--
we
don't
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
there
is
another
possible
conflict,
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute
that
i
think
would
arise
anyway,
but
we
don't
think
that
the
foreign
affairs
power
of
this
--
united
states
is
a
sovereign
country
depends
on
us
doing
nothing
in
situations
which
are
of
extreme
importance
to
the
country.
now
as
i've
indicated,
the
war
power
--
another
war
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
would
--
the
embarrassment
as
this
court
indicated
would
arise
even
--
it
might
very
well
arise
even
though
we
did
nothing.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
agree
mr.
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
justice,
i
agree
with
you
on
the
distinction,
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
difference.
the
reason
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
difference
is,
because
i
don't
think
the
foreign
affairs
power
of
united
states
means
merely
some
kind
of
a
defensive
action
to
try
to
prevent
embarrassment
in
italy
when
somebody
votes
in
an
italian
election
or
in
mexico
when
somebody
votes
in
an
mexican
election.
the
foreign
affairs
power
of
the
united
states
and
one
which
congress
has
the
power
to
legislate
under
means
the
right
to
protect
the
sovereign
rights
of
the
united
states.
now
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
war.
people
were
going
across
the
border
to
escape
the
draft.
there
was
a
loss
of
man
power;
there
was
a
possibility
of
loss
of
morality
because
of
this
escape.
i
don't
think
that
the
foreign
affairs
power
only
means
that
we
could
keep
quiet
and
therefore
have
no
conflict
with
anyone
because
we
kept
quiet.
but
in
addition,
there
is
another
possible
conflict
and
that
is
with
dual
nationals,
particularly
dual
nationals,
but
resident
aliens
too,
going
across
the
border
to
mexico
who
are
of
draft
age
during
the
time
of
war,
there
was
an
extremely
good
possibility
that
they
would
be
constricted
by
mexico
or
another
country,
which
they
--
in
which
they
sort
refuge.
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
the
united
states
would
be
called
upon
to
give
them
protection.
this
isn't
just
the
theoretical
problem,
just
exact
questions,
exact
problem
arose
during
the
civil
war
when
americans
left
the
country
to
evade
the
draft
and
then
the
united
states
was
called
upon
to
give
them
protection
when
their
country
of
refuge
attempted
to
conscript
them.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
we
can
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
have
done
so
in
the
past.
i
think
however
that
this
not
--
this
is
not
normally
that
this
particular
remedy
is
not
a
very
good
one.
the
reason
it
isn't
is
because
when
a
policy
is
attempting
--
when
a
country
is
attempting
to
maintain
a
policy
with
a
neighboring
country
such
as
mexico
--
to
tell
mexico
it's
okay
to
draft
some
people,
but
it's
not
okay
to
draft
other
american
citizens
is
not
a
policy
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
okay,
is
it
dual
nationals
then
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
as
a
matter
of
international
law
they
would,
but
we
have
still
made
representations
in
the
past
as
a
matter
of
history
to
try
to
get
american
citizens
who
were
dual
nationals
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
government
submits
that,
that
this
statute
well
of
course
could
not
remedy
all
the
problems
which
i
have
indicated,
was
of
considerable
benefit
in
remedying
some
of
them,
because
the
unfairness
of
sacrifice
between
american
citizens
was
ended
because
draft
evaders
who
left
the
country
were
no
longer
american
citizens.
they
no
longer
could
claim
equal
rights
with
other
americans
without
assuming
their
fair
share
of
the
obligations,
and
the
possibility
of
conflict
over
the
draft
problem
imposed
by
other
countries
was
ended
because
since
the
draft
evaders
no
longer
were
american
citizens
they
were
no
longer
entitled
to
protection.
i'd
like
to
pause
briefly
at
this
point
and
emphasize
the
similarity
of
section
of
401(j)
with
the
statute,
which
was
upheld
in
the
perez
case
and
the
lack
of
similarity
between
section
401(j)
in
the
desertion
statute
that
was
held
unconstitutional
in
trop.
i
have
emphasized
that
the
point
of
draft
evaders
is
likely
to
involve
complications
with
other
countries.
in
perez,
this
was
the
ground
principally
relied
on
sustaining
the
statute.
in
trop,
there
was
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
foreign
countries
at
all.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
because
the
statute
as
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
believe
pointed
out,
his
concurring
opinion
did
not
even
--
was
not
restricted
in
anyway
to
desertion
in
a
foreign
country
or
fleeing
to
a
foreign
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
deserted
for
i
believe
a
single
day
in
algeria
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
there
are
two
answers
there.
first
of
all,
the
statute
as
a
whole
was
not
directed
to
people
that
were
in
algeria.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
is
trop
and
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
if
that's
the
actual
facts
of
trop.
he
deserted
in
a
country
which
was
under
american
occupation
or
at
least
--
there
was
no
possibility
of
any
conflict
in
that
case.
now
it
may
be
--
i
really
--
our
cases
which
one
could
be
a
deserter
and
could
involve
foreign
affairs
problems,
but
this
court
emphasized
what
mr.
justice
brennan
emphasized
that
the
statute
was
not
directed
to
foreign
affairs
problems.
now
secondly
in
perez,
this
court
emphasized
that
the
voting
of
american
citizens
in
foreign
elections
embarrassed
united
states
and
therefore,
taking
away
citizenship
ended
the
problem
as
i
have
indicated
as
to
at
least
two
of
the
problems
involved
in
draft
evaders
leaving
for
foreign
countries,
the
taking
away
of
citizenship,
hence
that
problem.
third
mr.
justice
brennan,
noted
in
the
trop
case
that
expatriation
appeared
to
have
a
little
additional
effect
in
detouring
deserters
for
expatriation
could
only
occur
after
there's
been
a
court-martial
and
the
court-martial
have
the
power
to
impose
long
imprisonment
or
even
death.i
n
contrast,
this
statute
does
not
apply
to
people
who
have
been
convicted
by
a
court-martial
by
any
other
court
of
law.
it
applies
only
to
people
who
are
outside
the
united
states
and
it
cannot
be
extradited.
therefore
the
only
remedy
that
they
--
obviously
they
could
not
be
punished
at
all,
certainly
not
by
death
and
the
only
remedy
that
congress
had
before
is
the
possibility
of
expatriation.
and
finally,
justice
brennan
again
in
the
trop
case
noted
that
the
loss
of
citizenship
was
severe
and
particularly
that
statelessness
would
likely
be
solved
and
he
therefore
suggested
that
these
facts
indicated
there
should
be
a
stronger
connection
between
expatriation
and
the
power
conferred
by
the
constitution.
but
the
severity
of
this
statute
is
substantially
less
than
the
severity
of
the
desertion
statute
involved
in
the
trop
case.
here
as
i've
indicated
that
normal
situation
is
that
of
a
dual
national
who
still
as
a
citizen
of
the
country
in
which
he
himself
took
refuge
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
statute
is
properly
applied
to
both.
we
think
it
is
even
more
clear
that
it's
properly
applied
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
to
the
dual
national.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
difference
--
one
of
the
differences
is
at
least
mr.
justice
brennan
thought
there
was
a
difference
depending
on
severity,
how
close
the
power
conferred
by
the
constitution
is
to
expatriation.
he
thought
that
because
of
the
severity
of
the
desertion
statute,
the
government
was
required
to
show
a
closer
connection.
now
if
that
is
true
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
normal
situation
is
not
severe,
no
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
let
me
go
back
--
the
maximum
think
that
can
happen
to
him,
we
do
not
concede
is
punishment.
the
max
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
do
not
believe
it
is
punishment.
the
maximum
severity
of
harm,
the
harm
that
can
result
and
the
worst
that
can
happen
is
a
person
who
is
stateless
and
has
no
connection
whatsoever
to
any
country
we
do
not
think
that
will
rise
frequently,
if
at
all
under
the
statute
that
my
colleague
will
discuss
the
problems
of
statelessness
under
the
statute
in
the
cort
case,
because
that's
where
it
is
directly
involved.
but
the
large
majority
of
the
cases
involve
people
who
will
not
be
stateless
at
all,
and
we
think
the
statute
should
be
considered
on
that
basis.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
i've
you
spoken
before,
but
we
do
not
believe
this
is
punishment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
know
whether
i
have
misspoken
before,
but
we
do
not
believe
this
is
punishment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
senator
russell,
the
senate
had
very
little
to
do
with
this
bill
at
all.
it
arose
in
the
house.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
he
set
the
penalty
too,
but
as
far
as
characterizing
him
as
the
sponsor
i
was
only
trying
to
explain
that.
he
mentions
i
think
the
word
penalty
twice.
we
think
that
this
is
the
kind
of
loose
talk,
which
is
often
used,
for
example,
with
the
regard
to
the
fraud
penalty
in
tax
litigation.
this
court
held
that
was
a
civil
remedy.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
he
did
not
say
it
was
the
penalty
and
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
principle
that
they
had
occurred
in
the
house,
there
is
no
mention
of
any
penalty
or
punishment
or
anything
or
punishment
or
anything
suggesting
penalty
or
punishment
in
the
house.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
there
were
two
consequences,
i
agree.
the
same
thing
you
might
say
that
in
addition
to
going
to
jail
when
you
are
convicted
of
a
felony
you
lose
your
right
to
vote,
but
i
don't
think
that
shows
the
right
to
vote,
the
loss
of
the
right
to
vote
is
punishment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
legally
speaking.
i
would
like
to
come
to
punishment
a
little
more
fully
later
on.
and
now
i
just
consider
the
third
source
as
substantive
power
on
which
we
believe
this
statute
can
constitutionally
be
based,
the
inherent
sovereign
power
of
every
country
over
its
nationality
and
its
citizenship.
this
court
said
a
long
time
ago
in
the
wong
kim
ark
case
that
every
independent
nation
has
the
inherent
right
to
determine
for
itself
and
according
to
its
own
constitution
and
laws
what
classes
of
person
shall
be
entitled
to
its
citizenship,
and
the
same
kind
of
thought
was
repeated
in
the
mackenzie
case
in
239
us.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
they
are
not
in
those
terms,
but
of
course
we
were
relying
on
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
it
does
not,
but
this
court
has
not
construed
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
preventing
expatriation
in
the
perez
case,
savorgnan
case
and
several
other
cases.
in
fact,
the
majority
of
the
court
even
in
the
trop
case
does
not
say
that
there
is
no
underlying
power
of
congress
to
expatriate
persons.
we
submit
that
congress
can
use
the
power
over
nationality
and
citizenship
to
impose
a
duty
of
allegiance,
meaningful
allegiance
on
american
citizens.
in
the
luria
case,
this
court
stated
that
citizenship
is
a
membership
in
a
political
society
and
implies
a
duty
of
allegiance
on
the
part
of
the
member
and
the
duty
of
protection
on
the
part
of
society.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
at
the
intermission
i
was
discussing
the
source
of
constitutional
power
held
by
congress
over
citizenship
and
nationality.
and
i
was
alluding
in
particular
to
the
luria
case
decided
by
this
court,
which
describes
the
obligations
of
citizenship
in
the
--
the
same
time
the
obligations
of
this
country
to
its
citizens.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
231
united
states,
begins
at
99,
i
am
going
to
quote
from
page
22.
the
court
said
that
citizenship
is
a
membership
in
a
political
society
and
implies
a
duty
of
allegiance
on
the
part
of
the
member
and
a
duty
of
protection
on
the
part
of
the
society.
well,
when
these
are
reciprocal
obligations,
one
being
a
compensation
for
the
other,
we
submit
the
respondent
has
broken
this
mutual
compact
and
therefore
that
congress
could
reasonably
provide
that
he
was
no
longer
a
citizen.
short
of
treason
and
the
like,
we
believe
that
section
401
applies
to
conduct,
which
is
at
the
furthest
extreme
from
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
the
persons
which
come
under
the
statute
have
first
of
all
deliberately
evaded,
what
this
court
has
said
and
i
indicated
before
we
rely
on
the
statement
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
draft
evader
has
evaded
as
i
have
indicated
the
supreme
and
noble
duty
of
every
citizen
to
defend
his
country
in
time
of
war
and
national
emergency,
but
draft
evasion
is
not
sufficient
for
expatriation
under
the
statute.
the
draft
evader
must
leave
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
evading
his
duty.
we
think
this
point
means
two
things.
first
of
all,
it
means
that
the
draft
evader
is
taking
himself
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
is
completely
abandoning
his
country
in
time
of
great
danger
and
we
think
that
the
flight
means
something
else.
it
means
that
the
draft
evader
is
placing
himself
within
the
jurisdiction
and
under
the
protection
of
a
foreign
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
have
been
possible
to
make
that
kind
of
a
determination
and
that's
which
make
that
the
case
go
off
in
that,
that
is
not
what
the
district
court
found
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
ground
which
would
allow
for
expatriation
on
that
basis.
we
think
that
the
statute
--
as
i've
indicated
before,
we
think
this
statute
applies
to
dual
nationals
and
everyone
else.
we
think
at
the
least
it
applies
constitutionally
to
dual
nationals.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
correct
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
want
to
overstate
the
facts
in
this
case.
there
was
no
proof
in
this
record
that
when
he
went
to
mexico
he
intended
to
give
up
his
american
citizenship.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
--
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
congress
could
reasonably
determine
that
when
a
person
does
this,
it
is
that
he
is
choosing
that
his
primary
allegiance
is
to
another
country,
that's
right
and
we
think
that
would
be
enough
to
sustain
the
statute
as
applied
to
mendoza-martinez.
however,
i
would
--
the
cort
case
which
is
going
--
which
is
also
going
to
have
to
be
decided
by
this
court
involves
different
facts,
although
we
think
that
the
situation
in
court
is
not
materially
different
that
he
too
chose
a
foreign
country
voluntarily
and
that
--
but
it
–-
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
it
involves
the
successor
and
there
is
no
legislative
history
of
the
successor
indicates
any
different
than
this
one.
i
think
that
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
it
has
to
be
treated
the
same.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
i
think
i
stated
that
to
mr.
justice
goldberg.
we
don't
think
there
is
any
evidence
in
this
particular
case
then
when
he
went
to
mexico,
he
intended
to
give
up
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
correct,
just
as
the
same
problem
was
involved
in
mckenzie.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
exactly,
your
honor.
we
--
and
we
think
that
under
the
mackenzie
case,
the
savorgnan
case,
the
perez
case
that
it's
not
important
whether
he
had
an
intent.
however,
we
think
that
as
to
dual
nationals
there
is
even
more
clearly,
was
it
reasonable
for
congress
to
say
that
people
in
this
situation
have
chosen
their
country
of
primary
allegiance,
whatever
their
subjective
intention
is,
it's
immaterial.
their
subjective
intention
maybe
that
they
like
the
united
states
better
than
mexico.
but
as
a
matter
of
the
objective
facts
that
they
have
chosen,
they
have
manifested
allegiance
to
another
country
and
that
as
applied
to
mendoza-martinez
and
the
large
group
of
people
that
--
the
largest
group
of
people
under
the
statute,
congress
could
reasonably
find
that
they
had
a
stronger
allegiance
to
another
country
and
should
not
be
allowed
to
have
--
to
continue
to
have
american
citizenship.
in
summary
on
this
point
we
think
that
what
congress
determined
here
whether
the
person
was
a
dual
national
or
not
however,
in
either
event,
what
congress
has
said
is
that
these
people
have
given
up
all
meaningful
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
and
therefore
the
united
states
need
not
continue
to
give
the
benefits
of
american
citizenship
to
people
of
this
type.
we
think
that
congress
can
reasonably
say
such
a
person
who
abandons
his
country
in
foul
weather
cannot
obtain
the
benefits
of
citizenship
in
fair.
and
this
is
approximately
what
attorney
general
biddle
told
the
congress
in
submitting
this
bill.
he
said
that
persons
who
are
unwilling
to
perform
their
duty
to
their
country
and
abandon
it
during
its
time
of
need
are
much
less
worthy
of
citizenship
than
are
persons
who
become
expatriated
on
any
of
the
existing
grounds,
and
of
course
existing
grounds
were
those
which
were
in
the
original
1940
nationality
act.
and
the
same
kind
of
statement
was
made
by
congressmen
dickstein,
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
in
the
house
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives.
now
again
i'd
like
to
pause
and
emphasize
the
similarity
of
this
--
of
the
connection
between
401(j)
to
the
inherent
powers
over
citizenship
that
existed
in
perez
and
the
dissimilarity
as
far
as
this
connection
is
concerned
with
the
statute,
the
desertion
statute
in
trop.
in
trop
mr.
justice
brennan
said
that
desertion
is
often
a
technical
offense
and
indeed
in
the
trop
case
itself,
the
particular
person
involved,
might
well
be
regarded
as
merely
a
technical
violation
of
the
desertion
laws.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
it
was
the
--
it
was
the
next
day
he
--
had
been
away
just
a
day.
we
submit
that
leaving
the
country
for
evading
the
draft
is
always
an
extremely
serious
offense.
now
the
second
ground
why
this
is
like
--
why
this
is
unlike
trop
is
that
in
the
trop
case
justice
brennan
compared
desertion
as
i've
indicated
before
to
failure
to
pay
the
taxes
and
said
that
failure
to
pay
taxes
in
desertion
bore
essentially
the
same
relationship
to
allegiance
to
one's
country.
as
i've
indicated
before
we
do
not
believe
this
is
true.
we
think
that
the
duty
to
serve
one's
country
is
on
a
higher
level,
but
even
accepting
the
fact
that
it
is
true,
persons
that
come
under
section
401(j)
are
not
just
draft
evaders.
they
are
people
who
have
left
the
united
states
and
we
think
that
they
are
leaving
the
united
states
for
a
foreign
country
shows
the
inconsistency
of
any
real
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
and
thirdly
in
the
trop
case
the
statute
applied
to
persons
with
no
connection
whatsoever
with
any
other
country.
therefore
the
most
that
one
could
say
in
trop
was
that
the
person,
the
deserter
had
given
up
allegiance
to
the
united
states,
but
here
we
think
that
the
statute
applies
to
people
in
which
it
can
fairly
be
said,
particularly
as
to
dual
nationals,
but
we
think
to
everyone,
that
they
have
indicated
considerable
allegiance
to
another
country
as
well
as
lack
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor
we
think
that,
that
--
that
under
this
third
source
of
power,
the
inherent
power
of
congress
over
a
citizenship
and
nationality,
that
congress
has
the
power
when
it
--
to
decide
that
a
person
has
lost
his
citizenship
when
it
can
fairly
be
said
that
he
has
manifested
lack
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
as
i
indicated
in
the
[inaudible]
cases
that
there
was
a
compact
between
the
citizen
and
his
country,
they
have
mutual
obligations.
and
if
that
is
true,
when
a
citizen
has
seriously
violated
his
obligation
to
his
country,
we
think
that
congress
has
the
power
to
decide
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
do
not
rest
the
statute
on
any
finding
by
congress
that
all
people
who
go
to
mexico
have
voluntarily
given
up
citizenship,
anymore
than
in
the
savorgnan
case
that,
that
matter.
there
it
was
admitted
that
the
woman
involved
did
not
intend
to
give
up
her
citizenship.
this
court
said
that
she
preformed
an
act,
which
under
the
statute
was
grounds
for
expatriation
and
it
did
not
matter
what
her
subjective
intent
was.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
i'm
basing
my
argument
on
an
entirely
different
proposition.
in
trop,
the
chief
justice's
plurality
opinion
stated
that
this
was
punishment,
the
desertion
statute,
made
expatriation
punishable
and
it
was
a
violation
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause.
now
if
this
was
punishment,
then
as
i'm
about
to
get
to,
we
would
run
into
the
problem,
whether
this
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
would
also
run
into
the
due
process
problem,
that's
right,
your
honor,
we
would
run
into
both
problems.
but
we
think
we
run
into
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
it's
not
like
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor
and
that's
why
i
say
we
rest
on
entirely
different
ground,
we
say
that
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
we
would
be
lost
in
any
case
other
than
this
one.
in
the
last
part
of
brief
we
argue
that
this
person,
that
mendoza-martinez
has
been
convicted
so
that
it's
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
the
law
--
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
would
--
no,
you
do
not
have.
and
you
don't
have
it;
you
wouldn't
have
it
in
most
case
to
be
frank.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
that's
right.
if
this
is
the
punishment,
court
has
not
received
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
congress
has
the
power
to
ascribe
to
certain
conduct
that
a
person
can
be
expatriated,
that's
right.
i
don't
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
subjective
intent
to
abandon
his
country?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
and
i
think
that's
the
explicit
holding
of
the
court,
as
i
say
in
the
savorgnan
case
and
perez
case
for
that
matter,
the
mckenzie
case
and
another
cases
in
dictum.
now
turning
to
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
where
does.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
the
curtiss-wright
case
this
court
said
that
the
federal
government
has
all
the
power
of
sovereignty
which
are
normally
to
the
--
which
other
sovereignties
have.
now
the
power
over
nationality
is
one
of
those
powers
of
sovereignty
you'd
think,
as
i've
quoted
a
statement
from
wong
kim
ark
case
saying
that,
that
says
approximately
just
that.
there
is
another
statement
in
mckenzie
in
here
that
is
approximately
to
the
same
effect,
that
this
is
what
every
country
in
the
world
believes
to
be
one
of
its
inherit
sovereign
powers
and
the
curtiss-wright
case
i
think
establishes,
as
well
as
mckenzie
in
here
and
wong
kim
ark,
that
this
is
a
power
like
all
other
inherent
powers
of
sovereignty.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
for
expatriation,
almost
all
countries
provide
for
expatriation
for
different
types
of
problems,
of
activity.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
well,
i
have
a
list
of
a
large
number
of,
kind
of
--
it
depends
on
the
--
they
are
different
acts,
different
acts
of
--
now
as
to
this
particular
act,
i
think
there
are,
i
forgotten
the
names,
i
think
there
were
couple
countries
that
specifically
provides
this
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that's
right.
and
then
there
is
a
much
broader
group
of
countries
as
to
naturalize
citizens
have
such
a
broad
grounds
for
taking
away
their
citizenship
that
it
would
probably
cover
this
kind
in
the
act
--
pretty
commonwealth
for
example.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
they
have
your
honor.
i
think
however
that
distinction
is
the
court
will
probably
later
see
in
the
schneider
case.
it
might
be
the
--
has
constitutional
problems
of
its
own.
so
the
fact
that
congress
decided
to
be
even
handed
with
all
american
citizens
i
don't
think
that
--
should
in
anyway
make
this
statute
less
constitutional.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
this
court's
opinion
in
the
curtiss-wright
case
is
directly
to
the
contrary
as
far
as
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
the
curtiss-wright
case
is
--
i
submit
is
as
explicit
on
this,
on
this
point
as
it
can
possibly
be.
it
says,
domestic
matters
your
honor's
description
of
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
is
precisely
accurate.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
think
--
i
think
your
honor
will
find
that
i'm
accurately
describing
it.
it
is
to
--
as
to
foreign
affairs
that
power
did
not
come
from
the
states
at
all
because
the
states
did
not
have
the
power
over
foreign
affairs,
they
were
not
sovereign.
according
to
the
curtiss-wright
case
that
that
power
came
from
england
to
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
england
to
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
sovereign
power
in
this
country
was
first
in
england
then
under
the
articles
of
the
confederation
in
the
confederation
and
then
came
to
the
federal
government,
it
never
passed
through
this.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
it
is
a
branch
of
it
in
one
sense
your
honor.
foreign
affairs,
i
have
emphasized
conflicts
with
other
countries
for
the
inherent
power
over
nationality
i
think
it's
immaterial.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
curtiss-wright
is
a
little
broader
than
that.
it
says
not
only
foreign
affairs
but
all
those
powers
normally
held
by
sovereign
nation
in
the
international
law.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
certainly
in
terms
in
the
first
instance
that's
right
your
honor.
however,
the
power
of
nationality
in
the
federal
government,
in
the
government,
in
the
nation
as
a
whole,
in
the
confederation
before
we
think
was
passed,
as
i
say
directly
under
curtiss-wright
to
the
federal
government.
now,
i
agree
with
you
your
honor
that
it
comes
from
the
same
source
just
like
the
foreign
affairs
power.
i'm
only
emphasizing
the
difference
for
one
purpose.
i'm
assuming
arguendo
for
this
point
that
there
was
no
conflict
with
mexico.
there
would
be
no
conflict
with
mexico.
even
so
we
think
that
the
federal
government
has
the
power
of
deciding,
the
congress
has
the
power
of
deciding,
the
people
that
so
manifest
lack
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
and
even
allegiance
to
a
foreign
country
may
have
their
citizenship
taken
away
just
as
they
--
because
they
have
broken
the
compact
in
essence.
turning
briefly
to
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause,
our
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
which
we
think
is
relatively
clear
that
this
statute
was
not
intended
to
impose
punishment,
and
we
think
the
applicable
standard
was
laid
down
by
this
court
very
recently
in
forming
a
nester.
and
there
the
court
stated
that
only
the
clearest
proof
could
suffice
to
establish
the
unconstitutionally
of
a
statute
on
the
ground
that
a
punitive
purpose
in
fact
lay
behind
the
statute.
judicial
inquires
and
the
congressional
motives
are
at
best
a
hazardous
matter
and
when
that
inquiry
seeks
to
go
behind
objective
manifestations
becomes
a
dubious
affair
indeed.
moreover,
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
with
which
this
enactment
like
any
other
comes
to
us,
forbids
us
lightly
to
choose
that
reading
of
the
statute's
setting
which
will
invalidate
it
over
that
which
will
save
it.
now,
this
court
has
held
in
many
cases
that
even
very
severe
harm
coming
to
individuals
is
not
punishment.
the
court
has
held
deportation
is
not
punishment.
denaturalization
which
is
very
similar
after
all
to
expatriation
in
as
to
its
effect
is
not
punishment,
disbarment
and
as
i
have
indicated,
the
fraud
penalties
as
they
are
called
in
tax
cases.
therefore,
we
think
these
cases
and
especially
in
flemming
and
nestor
established
that
even
very
severe
measures
do
not
constitute
punishment
if
congress
is
regulating
an
area
within
its
substantive
powers.
now,
i
have
argued
extensively
that
this
statute
is
related
to
regulation
the
congress
may
properly
exercise
as
military,
foreign
affairs,
and
citizenship.
in
addition,
we
think
the
terms
of
this
statute
make
quite
clear
the
punishment
was
not
intended.
it
is
unlike
the
trop
statute.
here
the
statute
does
not
depend
on
conviction
by
any
court.
in
fact
it
doesn't
even
depend
in
the
same
elements
of
a
crime
for
which
a
court
can
convict
because
as
i
have
emphasized
draft
evasion
does
not
constitute
ground
for
expatriation
only
if
a
person
leaves
the
country
or
remains
aboard
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft.
and
finally
your
honors,
we
think
that
unlike
in
trop
there
was
a
considerable
basis
in
trop
for
saying
that
desertion
statute
was
the
same
as
the
1865
statute.
in
1865
statute
there
was
fair
amount
of
evidence
that
it
wasn't
intended
for
purposes
of
punishment
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
desertion
statute
in
1940
shows
that
it
was
a
continuation
of
the
1865
statute
that
is
not
true
of
this
statute.
this
statute
was
not
even
in
existence
from
1940
until
1944.
the
draft
evasion
statute
in
1865
was
repealed
in
1940.
in
1944
on
the
basis
of
new
purposes
and
new
problems,
congress
enacted
this
statute.
now,
attorney
general
biddle
alluded
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
precedent
that
there
had
been
a
statute
of
this
kind
before,
but
he
did
not
say
that
this
statute
was
merely
for
the
same
purpose
and
had
--
and
was
a
continuation
of
the
earlier
statute.
we
therefore
submit
that
the
judgment
involved
should
be
reversed.
