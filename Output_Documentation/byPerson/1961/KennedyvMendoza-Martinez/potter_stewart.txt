justice
potter
stewart
naturally,
obviously,
i
can
assure
you,
he's
not
satisfied.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
also
be
the
record
that
was
before
us
in
the
1959
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
in
turn
refers
to
the
(voice
overlap)
declaratory
judgement
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
he
could
have,
how?
justice
potter
stewart
denying
he
was
a
male
person?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
proceed,
i'm
a
little
confused,
i
guess.
but,
how
could
he
have
put
this
question
an
issue
in
this
criminal
case?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
were
a
--
if
it
was
a
criminal
offense
whether
or
not
he
was
a
citizen
as
i
understand
you.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
guilty
plea,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
why
wouldn't
that
have
been
equally
true
in
perez
against
brownell?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
that
everything
you'd
said
is
of
extraordinary
applicability
to
this
case.
the
highest
duty
of
citizenship
is
to
serve
the
nation,
the
united
states
in
time
of
war
and
somebody
who
flees
to
another
country
to
evade
that
obligation
is
an
objective
matter
certainly
i
should
think
under
the
very
criteria
that
you've
been
discussing
to
be
considered
somebody
who's
abandoned
his
citizenship.
justice
potter
stewart
surely
as
much
as
perez
by
simply
voting
in
a
mexican
election.
justice
potter
stewart
the
same
sanction
was
imposed
in
that
case
as
the
government
would
impose
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
loss
of
citizenship.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
it
wasn't
punishment
there,
why
is
it
punishment
here?
justice
potter
stewart
differentiating
the
two,
isn't
it.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
do
turn
to
that,
where
do
you
find
this
inherent
power
of
congress
over
citizenship
and
nationality?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
your
argument
on
the
foreign
relations
power,
that's
an
explicit
power
and
on
the
war
power,
that's
an
extremely
explicit
power.
where
do
you
find
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
this
so
called
inherent
power?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
excuse
me,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
this
inherent
power
argument
really
is
the
foreign
affairs
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
assumingly
correctness
of
curtiss-wright,
this
is
limited
to
our
conduct
in
international
affairs
and
so
this
third
--
so
called
third
argument
is
really
a
branch
of
your
first
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
international
law.
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
relationship
generally,
i
should
think
between
a
sovereign
nation
and
its
citizens
and
on
the
question
whether
or
not
a
person
is
a
citizen
would
be
a
domestic
matter,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well
there
is
the
argument
that
so
much
more
subtle
than
the
remark
you
attribute
to
me,
that
the
argument
that
the
morale
of
those
people
who
stayed
here
and
who
did
submit
to
the
draft
and
who
did
serve
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
their
nation,
it
might
have
been
pretty
badly
impaired
had
they
known
that
their
fellow
citizens,
that
have
evaded
the
draft
simply
by
fleeing
to
another
country
with
impunity
and
then
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
this
nation
to
punish
the
guilty,
there
is
that
argument
that's
been
made
this
morning
as
i
understood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
is
that
you
come
back
after
the
shooting
is
over.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
there
is
no
such
tension.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
would
have
been
something
else.
justice
potter
stewart
be
sent
to
prison
for
what,
a
maximum
of
five
years.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
comparative
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
also
to
a
point
where
there
will
never
been
any
possibility
of
his
coming
back.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
are
relying
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
making
that
argument
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
first
sentence
of
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
--
your
present
argument
that
require
certainly
overruling
the
perez
case
and
probably
also
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
probably
also
hare
and
savorgnan.
justice
potter
stewart
well
some
will
say
a
basic
element
is
the
right
to
travel
from
here.
justice
potter
stewart
free
movement
too.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
don't
quite
get
it,
if
you
put
this
in
terms
of
a
contract;
you
say
that
there
is
something
absolutely
invulnerable
about
citizenship
as
such
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
so
far
as
involuntary
action
by
the
sovereign
goes,
but
that
a
sovereign
can
deny
diplomatic
protection
to
a
citizen
abroad?
justice
potter
stewart
well
isn't
that
also
a
breach
of
the
contract
if
there
is
a
contract?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
don't
quite
get
that.
i
honestly
understand
it,
because
it
seems
to
me
just
a
matter
of
degree
on
a
difference
in
time.
if
you
take
away
one-by-one
each
of
these
so
called
privileges,
you
end
up
with
maybe
somebody
who
is
--
if
you
want
to
label
him
a
citizen,
you
can,
but
he
hasn't
got
any
of
the
rights
or
privileges.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
far
as
[inaudible]
so
far
as
you
know
he
is
still
in
czechoslovakia?
justice
potter
stewart
although
since,
what
more
than
a
year
he
has
beenâ€¦
justice
potter
stewart
been
able
to
come
to
this
country.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
his
wife
in
1959
try
to
make
arrangements
for
him
and
try
to
make
a
--
negotiate
an
agreement
under
which
he
could
come?
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
the
statute
of
limitations
is
total?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
is
that
statutory
presumption?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
relied
on
very
heavily
administratively.
justice
potter
stewart
it
didn't
even
mention
it?
justice
potter
stewart
district
court
didn't
even
mention
it.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
doolittle
is
there
any
independent
legislative
history
behind
this
349(a)(10)
as
contracted
from
401(j)?
justice
potter
stewart
one-way
reports.
justice
potter
stewart
which
--
you
are
talking
about
the
1865?
justice
potter
stewart
between
1940
and
1944.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
quite
a
different
statute
that's
what
you're
telling
us.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
seems
to
me
if
i
may
suggest
so
and
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
quite
a
good
deal
of
difference
between
leaving
the
district
and
leaving
this
nation.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
is
unambiguous
as
far
as
its
meaning
goes,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
you
certainly
don't
make
the
argument
or
do
you
that
denationalization
itself
is
either
punishment
or
if
punishment,
cruel
and
unusual?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
you
are
asking
us
to
overrule
three
cases
in
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
perez
and
savorgnan
and
hare.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
said
perez.
justice
potter
stewart
savorgnan.
justice
potter
stewart
but
just
--
i
perhaps
i
didn't
put
my
question
very
well.
i
--
my
question
was,
was
whether
or
not
you're
urging
us
that
denationalization
per
se
is
punishment,
and,
(b)
if
punishment
whether
denationalization
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
that
is
involuntary
denationalization.
justice
potter
stewart
now
wouldn't
you
concede
that
at
least
three
cases
this
court
has
affirmed
situations
in
which
citizens
were
involuntarily
denationalized.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
a
criminal
trial
involving
the
constitutional
safeguards
that
surround
a
criminal
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
jury
trials
the
rest
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
on
that
basis.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
court
martial,
there
obviously
couldn't
be
that
here,
you're
not
saying
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
court
has
clearly
and
unambiguously
held,
has
it
not,
that
anytime
that
--
the
alleged
expatriate
at
anytime
can
ask
for
any
of
the
privileges
or
benefits
of
citizenship
and
if
they
denied
him
then
it's
up
to
the
government
in
a
court
of
law
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
that
had
the
heavy
burden
to
prove
the
act
of
expatriate.
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
were
trials
in
those
two
cases
and
there
was
a
trial
in
this
case.
