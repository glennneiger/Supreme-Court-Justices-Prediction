justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
it
would
not
have
a
bearing
upon
the
question,
eighth
amendment,
assuming
this
is
a
penalty?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
not
congress
here
have
said
that
the
very
act
of
leaving
the
country
to
avoid
military
service
in
time
of
war
or
national
emergency
is
so
inconsistent
with
allegiance
as
to
constitute
a
voluntary
renouncement
of
american
allegiance?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
that
not
have
been
its
basis
for
saying
what
it
did
in
401
(j)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
deserving
all
of
these
of
course
the
right
of
the
citizen
to
renounce?
