your
point
about
having
had
no
trial
prior
to
depravation
of
citizenship,
you
are
really
making
that
argument
aren't

in
nishikawa,
i
have
it
right
on
gonzalez
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
government
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
the
act
of
expatriation
and
that
this
occurs
in
a
trial
anytime
that
the
person
allegedly
who
expatriated,
asks
for
any
of
the
rights
of
citizenship.
