justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
he
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that,
that
time
he
was
not
a
citizen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
was
residing
in
mexico.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
he
was
not
a
citizen
of
this
country
and
was
residing
in
mexico?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
a
non-resident
alien,
was
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
time
he
was
indicted
for
evading
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
was
a
non-resident
alien
at
the
time
he
was
convicted
for
violating
the
draft,
was
he
rightly
or
wrongly
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
rightly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
any
act
as
violated
before
september
27,
1944?
justice
hugo
l.
black
1942,
what
--
that's
when
he
violated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
there
is
a
different
constitutionally
speaking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
technically
speaking
--
legally
speaking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
make
any
difference
in
your
judgment
as
to
the
power
of
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
meant.
you
are
not
placing
that
on
the
idea
that
congress
can
presume
or
find
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
a
man
has
voluntarily
abandoned
citizenship
if
he
hasn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
make
any
difference
to
your
argument,
that
this
was
what
you
would
call
technical
or
legal
punishment
for
a
crime?
would
you
say
that
congress
does
not
have
the
right
to
take
away
a
man's
citizenship
for
serious
crime?
as
i
understand
it
your
argument
is
broad
enough
to
--
but
even
if
it
was
so
called
technical
or
legal
punishment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
power
argument
you
are
making
is
rather
disturbing
to
me.
i
had
an
idea
that
the
constitution
was
adopted,
the
express
purpose
was
to
limit
its
power
of
the
national
government
to
those
specifically
granted
of
our
necessary
implications
from
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
case
would
cause
us
to
hold
that
the
federal
government
has
power
over
and
beyond
those
expressly
granted
to
it
by
the
states
and
the
original
constitution
are
granted
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
other
court
expressed
several
objections
to
that
case
and
that
gives
me
a
new
one.[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
power
came
from
england
or
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
just
had
a
riot
with
england.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
number
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
tot
case,
not
the
tot,
but
one
that
justice
roberts
wrote
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
tot,
t-o-t.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
been
trying
to
think
it
for
myself,
you'd
get
along
better
with
that,
not
a
joint
issue
of
that,
i
recall
during
the
first
world
war,
a
man
who
left,
dealing
the
soldiers
during
the
war
and
after
the
war,
but
that
man
finally
came
back.
it
seemed
to
me
like
you
could
--
your
argument
is
just
as
strong
without,
trying
to
refute
the
idea
that
a
lot
of
soldiers
would
really
resent
the
fact
that
the
government
didn't
try
to
get
somebody
who
had
run
off
to
keep
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
views
as
of
before
of
course
have
been
expressed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
certainly
take
away
his
right
to
vote
as
i
understand.
could
they
take
away
his
right
to
talk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why,
if
they
can
take
away
the
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
because
it's
inherited,
because
the
constitution
says
that
you
should
have
right
to
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
understand
was
the
object
of
putting
it,
right
to
citizenship
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
reviewed
the
record
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
did
not,
in
that
amendment
of
course
seek
to
define
what
would
be
the
rights
of
this
citizenship
that
they
gave,
but
they
left
that
to
be
developed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
according
to
the
constitutional
--
within
the
constitutional
limitation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
his
status
here
in
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
his
status
here
in
this
country
if
he
is
stateless
and
comes
back
later
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
of
course
if
he
did
come
back
he
couldn't
get
privileges
and
immunities
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
say
[inaudible]
if
he
came
back
what
would
happen
to
him,
would
he
be
deportable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
would
be
his
status?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
would
be
an
alien
who
didn't
even
have
the
privileges
of
an
alien,
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
there
is
certain
privileges
and
immunities
which
a
man
has
even
as
an
alien.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
the
states
wouldn't
have
to
recognize
any
of
the
privileges
of
immunity
as
a
citizen.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
pervious
[inaudible]
most
of
the
countries
in
the
world
about
how
we'll
treat
that
aliens,
the
states
have
to
abide
by
it.
would
any
--
would
he
have
any
of
that
protection
from
anywhere
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
would
have
no
rights
that
an
alien
has
from
any
country
that
has
a
treaty
with
us.
he
would
have
no
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
of
this
country
under
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
their
main
protection,
do
they
not
come
from
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
possible,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
that
you're
repeating
the
statement
that
in
view
of
the
powers
of
the
government,
do
you
mean
by
that
powers
that
are
not
granted
in
the
constitution
either
expressly
or
impliedly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
not
find
any
constitution
authority
directly
recognizing
the
government,
federal
government's
power
to
conduct
foreign
affairs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
disturbing,
because
i
had
supposed
that
if
there
is
anything
it
was
settled
in
this
country
at
an
early
date,
the
laws
of
the
federal
government
had
no
power
except
that,
which
was
expressly
granted
and
granted
by
the
necessary
implications
and
the
necessary
[inaudible].
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
about
reading
of
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
look
to
something
inherent
that's
not
in
the
constitution
nor
defined
that
the
federal
government
has
failed
to
make
the
treaty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
they
represent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
we
have
that
issue
to
decide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
he
was
remaining
away
to
avoid
the
draft.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
district
court
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
wouldn't
that
be
enough
in
the
absence
of
any
statement
by
him?
it
seems
to
me
like
you've
got
very
grave
and
important
questions,
and
i
wasn't
--
up
to
this
time
i
didn't
suppose
we
had
to
consider
this
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
deny
that
there's
been
a
trial
on
that
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
raises
a
constitutional
question
in
itself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
referred
to
that
in
my
--
one
of
my
opinions
and
the
opinion
i
wrote
in
trop.
justice
hugo
l.
black
relevant
to
a
military
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
object
to
that
kind
of
a
trial,
is
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
--
and
what
you're
saying
as
i
understand
it
is,
that
even
the
statute
is
constitutionally
valid,
they
can't
hide
in
the
fashion
in
which
they
did
on
affidavits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
civil
rights
and
trial
by
jury
might
have
something
to
do
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
might
interrupt
you
[inaudible].
i
don't
quite
understand
the
point
of
your
argument.
if
--
i
would
say
that
if
the
federal
government
has
the
power
to
do
this
under
any
one
of
the
clauses
of
the
constitution,
then
it
had
to
refer
to
it.
i
don't
quite
get
that.
i
don't
see
why
it
would
have
to
refer
to
it?
it
might
think
it
was
acting
under
one,
was
acting
under
another
like
go
on
and
indict.
what
is
the
--
why
do
you
use
this
argument
and
what
you
want
to
prove
by
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
--
what
i
get
at
and
what
i
don't
understand
is
this,
whether
they
intended
it
to
be
based
on
that
or
not,
if
can
be
based
on
it
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
ground
i
don't
think
that
i
would
draft?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i'm
suggesting,
quite
different
suggesting
that
if
congress
has
the
power
to
do
this
under
any
clause
of
the
constitution,
i
wouldn't
think
statute
could
be
invalidated
by
what
some
individual
congressman
or
leader
or
spokesmen
of
the
committee
or
anything
else
said
was
his
purpose.
if
it
comes
within
the
authorized
power
of
congress,
why
do
we
have
to
bother
about
what
they
thought
they
wanted
to
do
it
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
is
all
out,
and
put
in
the
committee
and
they
said
our
purpose
is
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
considering
the
meaning
--
but
considering
the
powe.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
as
i
understand
it,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
it
and
i
may,
i'm
not
sure,
your
argument
as
i
understand
it,
so
as
congress
--
so
we
assume
that
[inaudible]
is
all
we
want
to
act
under
the
war
power,
contribution
to
the
war
power.
they
then
come
in
and
they
ask
you
through
the
[inaudible]
and
ask
you
to
enforce
the
act
on
the
basis
that
it
helped
in
foreign
relations;
that,
that
couldn't
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
waiving
that
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
ground
on
which
his
passport
was
denied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
that
in
this
case
the
position
was
that
the
statue
itself
makes
a
man
automatically,
deprives
him
of
citizenship
if
he
leaves
here
on
the
account
of
--
to
evade
the
draft
and
if
that
happens
before
he
has
any
kind
of
a
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
automatic
depravation
of
citizenship
without
any
kind
of
trial
in
any
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
it?
am
i
right
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
the
statute
provides?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
get
a
judicial
review
of
that,
what
kind
of
judicial
review
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
call
your
attention
this
also,
that
this
is
a
trial,
it's
a
trial
by
the
judges,
if
this
man
had
an
automobile
license
or
if
somebody
took
away
a
$6
--
$25
piece
of
property,
but
he
was
tried
for
offense
which
would
subject
him
to
no
less
depravation
for
the
matter
of
loss
of
citizenship,
he
would
have
a
trial
by
a
jury
or
judges,
who
tried
the
whole
case
with
counsel,
right
to
counsel
and
all
of
those
things.
and
there
is
a
question
that
arises
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
whether
that
kind
of
so
called
judicial
review,
the
kind
of
protection
that
the
constitution
affords
the
man,
because
they
take
him
--
they
take
away
his
citizenship.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
kind
of
a
trial
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
having
the
trial
not
merely
the
review
of
some
administrative
agency
that
has
heard
evidence
and
made
findings
and
so
forth.
you
say
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
trial
before
they
do
this,
he
is
entitled
to
trial
by
jury
with
all
the
protection
that
the
court
of
law
affords
the
man
charged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
with
it,
that
he
was?
