justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
have
the
page
number
of
that
unpronounceable
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
942
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
it's
of
any
significance
that
mendoza
was
a
dual
national?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
is,
but
i
was
just
asking
the
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
it
would
have
applied
equally
here
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
name
of
that
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
draft
of
that
is
still
pending?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
congress
has
put
in
a
recital
on
something
that
the
committee
reports,
simply
saying
that
citizens
who
don't
respond
to
their
duty
to
serve
in
the
army
in
time
of
war
are
not
worthy
of
being
citizens
and
we
don't
want
them
as
citizens,
supposing
they
had
said
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
then
the
other
material
question
--
your
argument
is
that
there
is
no
power
to
do
this.
we
have
to
attribute
given
power,
we
have
to
attribute
to
congress,
whether
it
said
so
or
not,
a
purpose
to
exercise
power
that
--
by
hypothesis
we
are
assuming
now,
it
has
and
attribute
a
legitimate
exercise
that
power
to
whatever
it
says
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
whatever
it
fails
to
say.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i
suggest
what
mr.
justice
goldberg
said
might
be
borne
in
mind
that
i
should
think
the
foreign
relations
was
time
of
emergency
or
time
of
war,
whether
you
call
it
war
power
or
foreign
relations
power,
two
things
are
absolutely
inseparable
i
think,
under
the
right
conditions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
at
some
point
to
the
question
as
to
whether
congress
has
power
to
take
away
citizenship
without
the
citizen's
consent?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
is
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
boudin
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you're
assuming
or
accepting,
event
though
you
don't
agree
with
it,
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
denationalize
without
consent,
your
argument
bypasses
that
question
or
assumes
it.
in
another
words
you
say
you
can
win
this
case
even
making
that
concession.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
you
have
some
slight
stumbling
block.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
fact
that
the
court
has
decided
at
least
three
times
that,
that
isn't
so.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
review
de
novo,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
evidentiary
wise,
constitutional
wise,
statutory
wise,
every
wise.
justice
john
m.
