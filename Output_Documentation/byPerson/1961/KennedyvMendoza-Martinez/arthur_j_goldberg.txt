why
do
you
suppose
your
client
went
to
mexico?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
don't
think
he
had
a
greater
attachment
to
mexico
and
then
just
left?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
it
be
logical
to
assume
that
if
we
had
nothing
successful
in
the
war
that
his
attachment
to
mexico
would
have
been
a
little
deeper
than
you
indicate?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
does
your
argument
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
any
kind
of
deportation
is
penal
because
the
consequences
are
just
as
bad,
are
they
not?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
any
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
if
congress
had
specified
here
that
anybody
who
knows
he
has
dual
nationality,
who
live
--
is
living
in
the
country
where
he
has
nationalities,
dual
nationality
and
who
stays
in
that
country
for
one
year,
six
months
after
he
is
called
up
for
selective
service,
looses
his
nationality,
would
your
argument
still
reach
that,
knowingly
--
knowing
the
element
being
present
in
all
the
case
that
i've
indicated?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
think
voting
is
more
of
an
intent
than
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no
i
did
not
go
that
far,
i
said
he
was
there,
but
he
remains
there
after
a
statute,
which
says
that
if
you
stay
another
year
there
during
time
of
war
and
do
not
report
back,
you
will
then
lose
your
nationality.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
could
we
say
--
could
it
be
said
you
don't
have
a
right
to
have
a
passport
except
to
return
to
the
united
states?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
he
said
in
his
affidavit
that
he
wanted
to
come
back
but
he
has
not
chosen
to
do
so.
he
would
then
be
an
alien
legally
admissible
to
the
united
states
with
all
of
the
rights
of
an
alien
under
any
result
that
might
happen.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
but
i'm
assuming,
suppose
you're
right
here,
even
then
he
would
have
been
legally
admitted
to
the
united
states
and
would
be
an
alien
resident?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
are
not
pleading
the
american
citizenship
with
czechoslovak
citizenship.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
thought
the
government
counsel
has
conceded
[inaudible]
he
would
be
regardless
of
outcome
of
this
case
a
legally
resident
alien
[inaudible]
against
you?
