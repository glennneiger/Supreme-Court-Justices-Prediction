a
very
wise
man
once
said,
“one
good
answer
is
enough.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
that
your
--
the
answer
you've
given
me
is
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
a
better
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
saying
that
underlying
your
specific
argument
is
the
assumption,
the
starting
point
that
the
three-judge
court
provision
must
be
strict
according
to
the
letter
enforced
and
no
argumentative
consideration,
something
just
as
good
as
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
at
the
bottom
of
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
have
put
it,
couldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
is
that
quite
so,
he
might
have
attacked
the
--
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
in
the
united
states
doesn't
prove
he
was
a
resident
alien.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
isn't
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
lawyers
--
wouldn't
they
do
things
that
are
not
so.
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
think
they're
not
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
might
challenge
it
on
both
grounds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
you
don't
want
to
embrace
that
opportunity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
congress
make
it
an
offense
punishable
heavily,
say,
five
years,
a
sentence
of
five
years,
a
mandatory
sentence
for
five
years
for
leaving
the
country
to
escape
the
draft?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could've
hung
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
that
--
that
wouldn't
be
coercive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
when
you
use
words
like
coercive
and
slide
from
coercive
to
punitive,
and
slide
from
punitive
to
the
constitution,
you're
doing
a
lot
of
sliding,
more
than
three
bases
i
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
you're
meant
to
slide.
i'm
saying
you
first
used
the
word
coercive
and
in
the
next
sentence
you
used
the
word
punitive,
in
the
next
sentence
you've
said
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
indicating
that
if
what
you
say
goes
and
congress
couldn't
impose
a
sentence
of
five
years,
so
you
say
hang
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
it
could.
i'm
not
--
i've
expressed
no
opinion
on
this
statute.
i'm
merely
saying,
you
throw
around
words
like
coercive
and
punitive
doesn't
help
me
in
the
slightest
to
analyze
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
constitution
doesn't
say
congress
couldn't
make
it
--
couldn't
have
--
affect
penal
consequences
for
leaving
the
country
to
obey
this,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
but
using
adjectives
--
using
adjectives,
it
doesn't
settle
complicated
constitutional
questions.
