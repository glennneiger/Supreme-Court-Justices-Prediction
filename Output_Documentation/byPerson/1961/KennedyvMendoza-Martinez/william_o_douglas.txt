justice
william
o.
douglas
on
the
merits,
are
there
any
decisions
apart
from
the
lower
court
ruling
in
this
case
that
a
resident
alien
who
leaves
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft
and
returns
could
be
prosecuted
for
evading
the
service?
justice
william
o.
douglas
they're
the
ones
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
say
in
your
brief
would
be
subject
to
prosecution?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes
but
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
this
the
only
decision
--
judge
jertberg's
decision.
is
that
only
one
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
thought
we
have
to
decide
the
resident
alien
point
in
this
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
collateral
estoppel,
don't
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
is
no
--
would
be
no
collateral
estoppel
if
he
was
a
resident
alien.
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
a
resident
alien
be
relieved
from
responsibility
if
he
ceased
to
be
a
resident?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
just
assumed
that
an
alien
who
left
the
country
who
had
been
a
resident
would
cease
to
be
a
resident
--
of
the
resident
on
leaving.
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
there
any
facts
in
this
case
to
indicate
that
if
he
had
the
--
treated
as
an
alien,
that
he
still
have
the
purpose
to
maintain
his
residence
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
the
government's
position
is
right,
that
the
violation
of
the
act
automatically
deprives
a
person's
citizenship,
he
wasn't
a
citizen
at
the
time,
was
he?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
he
was
a
non-resident
alien
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
would
he
have
lost
his
citizenship,
i'm
little
confused
on
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
he
left
the
country?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
he
lost
his
citizenship
there?
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
he
was
a
--
not
a
citizen
but
he
was
--
is
your
theory
that
of
a
non-resident
alien?
justice
william
o.
douglas
therefore
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted
unless
he
was
a
citizen
under
the
selective
service
act.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
just
happened
to
be
reading
attorney
general's
letter
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
says
while
such
persons
are
liable
to
prosecution
for
violation
of
the
selective
service
act
if
and
when
they
return
to
this
country,
it
would
seem
proper
in
addition
they
should
lose
their
united
states
citizenship.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
seems
like
in
terms
of
penalty
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
adding
to
the
penalty
of
going
to
jail.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
i
don't
what
this
has
to
do
with
the
merits.
he
either
has
a
legal
right
or
he
doesn't
have
a
legal
right.
these
equities,
these
so
called
equities
you're
talking
about
are
highly
relevant.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
is
a
permanent
[inaudible]
or
a
variable
or
something.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
are
not
really
addressing
yourself
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
i
thought
in
answer
to
justice
stewart
you
have
said
that
the
constitutional
question
is
always
open
before
this
court.
justice
william
o.
douglas
have
very
often
have
been
overruled.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
are
not
asking
for
an
advisory
opinion.
