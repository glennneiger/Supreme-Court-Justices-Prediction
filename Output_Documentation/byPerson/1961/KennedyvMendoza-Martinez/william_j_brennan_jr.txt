justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
before
you
get
to
them
mr.
davis,
this
is
a
one
judge
tentative
to
one
constitutionality
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
court
was
a
three-judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
wasn't
there
three-judge
court
required
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
sought
by
this
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
so,
at
page
23.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
we
don't
have
the
amended
complaint
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
would
it
--
well
now,
what
is
before
us?
the
second
or
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
concerned
about
it
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
where
--
how
do
we
know
all
this?
from
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
is
this
second
amended
complaint
before
us
is
part
of
the
record
upon
which
we
have
to
decide
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
get
this
clear
mr.
davis.
you're
telling
us
now
that
this
prayer
at
page
23
of
the
second
amended
complaint
asking
that
defendants
are
enjoined
and
restrained.
you
say
there
was
no
such
prayer
in
either
the
original
complaint
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
or
the
first
amended
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
might
explain
why
none
of
us
saw
the
possibility
of
the
three-judge
court
question
with
that
matter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
why
you
didn't
see
it
too.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
face
of
this
complaint.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
but
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
case
on
that
latter
proposition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
harlan.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
of
an
administrative
decision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
except
this,
mr.
davis.
if
we
had
only
this
complaint
before
us,
why
isn't
this
complaint
in
fact
seeking
a
declaration
that
he
was
a
citizen
and
in
addition,
an
injunction
enforcing
that
declaration,
not
merely
as
in
flemming
and
nestor,
the
reversal
of
an
administrative
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
face
of
this
complaint,
why
isn't
that
what
this
complaint
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
recollection
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
is
it
true?
it's
a
declaratory
judgment
that
he
is
a
citizen
and
the
relief
of
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
deportation
orders
on
the
ground
that
he
is
a
citizen,
not
merely
a
reversal
of
an
administrative
decision,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
you
may
be
right
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
all
they
asked
in
flemming
and
nestor
was
for
a
judgment
and
i'm
quoting
“affirming,
modifying
or
reversing
the
administrative
decision”.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
that's
all
i
ask.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
certainly
again
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
face
of
this
amended
complaint,
what's
asked
is
an
injunction
against
enforceable
deportation
letter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
deportation
orders
have
to
rest
on
the
constitutionality
of
facts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
see
how
that
is
an
enforcement
--
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
is
a
declaratory
judgment
though
under
the
general
declaratory
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1503
(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1503
(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
a
special
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
from
a
special
--
not
from
administrative
declaratory.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i
accept
your
words
and
your
description
that's
what
it
is,
that's
--
that's
an
accurate
descriptive
you
are
having.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
to
get
the
administrative
determination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
you
have
to
get
a
judicial
review
by
a
way
of
declaratory
judgment
and
i
suggest
that
if
you
answer
that,
a
prayer
for
injunctive
relief
has
certainly
this
second
amended
complaint.
then
you
do
raise
the
question
of
the
application
of
2283
and
the
requirement
for
three-judge
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see.
let's
say
for
example,
suppose
we
don't
have
this
particular
problem
but
one
just
relies
under
the
declaratory
judgment
action
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
statute.
and
all
he
seeks
is
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
was
all
that
was
done
in
this
case,
is
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
federal
statute,
that
in
that
way,
you
can
get
around
the
requirement
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
hasn't
--
that
--
has
this
court
ever
held
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
a
rather
easy
way
to
get
around
the
three-judge
requirement,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
tell
me.
tell
me,
if
there's
a
declaratory
judgment
that
an
act
of
congress
is
unconstitutional,
is
there
any
member
of
the
executive
department
charge
of
this
enforcement
that
would
in
fact
enforce
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sure
he
would.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
judicial
determination
that
is
unconstitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
either.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
was
the
idea
of
a
three-judge
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
long
way
around
to
saying
that
the
congress
didn't
want
single-judges
declaring
state
statutes
or
preventing
the
enforcement
of
state
statutes
in
the
grounds
of
unconstitutionality
by
enjoining
their
enforcement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
could
no
have
been
a
resident
alien
when
he
went
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
he
went
in
1942,
there
was
nothing
which
stripped
him
of
his
american
citizenship.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
he
was
an
american
citizen
in
1942.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
were
really
a
three-judge
case.
i
gather
we
couldn't
read
it.
there's
no
jurisdiction
in
the
judgment
below
if
this
should
have
been
a
three-judge
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
might
be?
it
would
be,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
have
a
jurisdiction
to
say
that
the
lower
court
had
no
jurisdiction,
and
we
have
to
say
it
had
no
jurisdiction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
surprised.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
did
the
(inaudible)
that
reviewed
the
statute
if
it
reaches
the
case
thoroughly,
reaches
it
by
merely
or
even
merely
with
your
application
for
an
injunction.
that's
the
way
the
statute
reads
from
the
fact
what
the
judge
gave
or
anything
else
to
which
it's
stipulated
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
before
you
begin,
i
think
you
told
us
yesterday
that
you
submitted
to
judge
jertberg,
a
court
order
which
included
the
provisions
for
injunctive
relief
and
that
he
refused
to
enter
it,
but
under
the
order
he
did.
did
the
government
make
any
objection
to
your
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
was
the
government's
objection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
the
fact,
unless
the

[inaudible]
justice
william

not
going
have

with

affairs
power
and
the
american
government
demands
a
return
of
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
nothing,
there
is
nothing
imminent
about
the
--
about
giving
any
diplomatic
protection
which
requires
[inaudible]
take
the
citizenship
away
from
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

we
can,
we
had
in
the
past.

justice
william
j.
brennan,

[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mr.
terris
did
i
correctly
understand
that
the
government's
position
is
that
statute
[inaudible]
draft
and
that
has
sole
purpose
[inaudible]
that
is
without
regard
to
what
may
have
been
the
motivation
of
the
draft
[inaudible]
that
to
embrace
another
citizenship
although
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
there
was
i
thought
your
position
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
congress
constitutionally
could
impose
expatriation
for
draft
evasion
whether
or
not
the
draft
evader
intended
to
renounce
american
citizenship
and
embrace
another
citizenship.

not?
justice

yes.

william

what
was
the
fact
here,
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,

[inaudible]
justice
william
j.

now
that's
the

[inaudible]
trial
and
no
trail
[inaudible]
what
was
the
trail
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
of
the
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
what
the
evidence
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
this
whole
[inaudible],
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
boudin
even
though
you
are
going
to
reargue
it,
may
i
just
ask
this?
it
was
suggested
yesterday
that
when
dr.
cort
entered
czechoslovakia,
he
sought
admission
as
a
stateless
person.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
statement
unsupported
by
anything
in
this
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
leads
me
to
ask
this.
if
we
have
the
problem,
which
in
your
view
we
don't,
whether
there
maybe
denationalization
except
with
the
consent
of
the
citizen,
might
a
citizen
renounce
american
citizenship
to
embrace
a
stateless
status?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
far
i
gather
our
cases
have
been,
savorgnan
and
mackenzie
at
least,
where
there
has
been
--
what's
been
embraced
has
been
another
allegiance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
any
event
if
dr.
cort
did
embrace
or
attempt
to
embrace
a
stateless
status,
he
certainly
has
changed
his
mind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
what
you
are
saying,
is
under
those
circumstances
and
if
there
should
be
a
reversal,
i
gather
that
the
--
he
became
–
ceased
to
be
an
american
citizen
as
of
whatever
is
the
date
found
that
he
committed
the
expatriating
act,
that's
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
my
point
is,
if
the
government
prevailed,
he
has
been
an
alien
every
since
19
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
what
you
are
saying
is
that,
that
being
so
a
question
would
be
raised
whether
when
admitted,
now
as
having
been
determined
that
at
the
time
of
admission
he
was
an
alien,
was
he
within
an
excludable
class?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
the
question
i
want
next
to
get
to.
he
would
clearly
be
within
an
excludable
class.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
does
it
follow
from
that,
that
he
would
also
then
be
deportable
within
one
of
the
classes,
deportable
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
