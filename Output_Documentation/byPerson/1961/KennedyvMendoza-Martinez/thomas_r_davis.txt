mr.
thomas
r.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
southern
district
of
california
under
28
united
states
code
1252
and
it's
here
on
direct
appeal
because
that
court
held
invalid
a
statute
of
congress,
section
401
(j)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
providing
that
person
subject
to
the
draft
who
leave
the
country
for
the
purpose
of
evading
draft
are
expatriated,
lose
their
nationality
and
section
1252
provides
for
direct
appeal
to
this
court
from
the
judgment
of
any
court
of
the
united
states
holding
invalid
a
statute
of
congress.
as
the
court
will
no
doubt
recall,
the
case
has
been
here
twice
before
at
the
october
term,
1957.
the
case
was
remanded
after
the
decisions
in
the
perez
and
trop
cases
relating
to
expatriation
for
foreign
voting
and
expatriation
for
desertion.
at
that
time,
the
district
court
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
it
was
again
appealed
by
the
government
directly
to
this
court.
after
the
argument
of
the
case,
the
court
sua
sponte,
found
in
the
record
a
lurking
question
of
collateral
estoppel
which
it
thought
beclouded
the
record
and
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
with
permission
to
the
parties
to
amend
the
pleadings
to
raise
that
issue.
and
the
case
was
so
remanded
and
as
i
shall
stand
in
a
min
--
state
in
a
minute,
that
issue
was
resolved
adversely
to
the
appellee
by
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
again
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
the
government
again
brought
the
case
here.
now,
in
this
posture
of
the
case,
there
are
two
issues
before
the
court.
one
is
the
non-constitutional
issue
on
which
the
court
remanded
the
case
the
last
time.
that
is
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel
because
mendoza-martinez,
the
appellee
had
been
convicted
of
draft
evasion
in
1947.
and
the
question
is,
whether
that
conviction
for
draft
evasion
in
1947
collaterally
estops
the
government
in
this
case
from
claiming
that
he
lost
his
citizenship
as
a
result
of
section
401
(j)
of
the
nationality
act.
and
the
other
question
is
the
same
question
which
has
been
twice
here
before
that
is
the
validity
of
the
statute
itself
and
that
issue
in
and
of
itself
comes
here
unencumbered
by
any
dispute
as
to
the
facts
because
the
facts
had
been
stipulated
below
both
on
the
prior
occasions
and
on
this
occasion
and
mendoza-martinez
has
agreed
that
he
did
leave
the
country
and
remain
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft.
i
should
state
at
the
outset
for
a
moment
that
there
follows
this
number
20,
a
court
case
which
has
a
relationship
to
this
case.
in
that,
there
was
presented
in
that
case
the
constitutionality
of
the
successor
provision
in
the
1952
act.
this
case
arises
under
the
1940
act.
the
successor
provision,
as
i
will
try
to
point
out
in
that
case,
is
in
the
respect
pertinent
here
is
the
same
as
section
401
(j)
with
which
we
are
dealing.
but
there
are
nonconstitutional
issues
in
the
court
case
which
are
different
from
the
non-constitutional
issue
in
the
present
case.
and
there
is
one
further
fact
which
i
should
mention
at
the
outset
which
may
have
some
significance
and
may
not
which
does
differentiate
the
court
case
from
the
present
case,
because
this
appellee
is
a
dual
national,
that
is
since
birth,
he
was
a
national
of
both
mexico
and
the
united
states.
the
court
in
the
next
case
so
far
as
we
know
is
only
a
national
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
facts
are
very
simple.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes,
but
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
the
answer
mr.
justice
is
that
a
three-judge
court
is
only
required
when
an
injunction
is
sought
against
the
enforcement
or
operation
of
an
act
of
congress,
an
injunction
as
the
words
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
may
i
go
into
that
for
a
moment,
mr.
justice.
i
have
two
answers.
and
one
is
that
as
this
case
was
brought
originally
and
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
record
of
the
1957
term
i
have
examined,
the
amended
complaint
which
came
to
the
court
at
that
time
as
solely
for
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
you
don't
have
the
first
amended
complaint.
it
was
unfortunately
never
printed.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes,
but
i'm
quite
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
that
was
amended
after
the
case
was
remanded
at
the
preceding
--
by
the
preceding
decision
of
the
court
and
which
consent
was
only
given
to
the
parties
to
amend
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel.
and
my
first
point
is
that
this
amendment
of
the
complaint
at
that
time
when
the
case
was
remanded
before
was
not
pursuant
to
the
commission
which
this
court
had
given
in
the
1959
term
and
it's
remanded
only
on
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel.
so
that
this
amendment
of
the
complaint
to
ask
for
an
injunction
against
the
deportation
order
which
is
on
page
23
of
the
record
was
not
--
it's
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
this
court
and
therefore
it
was
not
a
proper
amendment.
that's
my
first
point
in
that.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
the
mandate
of
the
court
is
in
the
record.
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
the
1959
term
is
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
at
page
--
at
page
20,
it
is
ordered
and
adjudged
by
this
court,
that
this
court
be
in
the
same
as
hereby
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
permission
to
the
parties
to
amend
the
pleadings
if
they
so
desire
to
put
in
issue
the
question
of
collateral
estoppel
and
to
obtain
an
adjudication
upon
it.
as
i
read
that,
it
gives
consent
to
one
amendment
of
the
complaint
or
one
subject.
it
does
not
give
consent
to
other
amendments
of
the
complaint.
that
is
my
first
answer
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes,
but
one
of
my
--
my
statement,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
this
amendment
was
an
improper
amendment
which
the
court
need
not
pay
attention
to
in
deciding
this
case.
i
have
other
answers
but
that's
my
first
one.
and
the
second
answer
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
but
obviously,
mr.
justice
brennan
may
not
be
satisfied
with
that
answer
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
then
i
would
go
on
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
--
i
under
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
understand,
mr.
justice.
the
second
answer
i
have
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
because
the
court
remanded
the
case
only
to
amend
the
case
--
amend
the
pleadings
with
respect
to
collateral
estoppel.
and
this
amendment
asking
for
an
injunction
in
addition
to
a
declaratory
junction
does
not
relate
to
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel,
has
asked
for
another
type
of
additional
relief
going
to
the
whole
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
don't
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
don't
know
about
the
original
complaint
but
the
first
amendment
complaint
which
i
have
seen
in
the
record
of
the
court
at
the
1957
term
which
was
first
here
did
not
contain
this
paragraph
four.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
think
actually
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
think
actually
--
i
think
it
doesn't
exist
even
apart
from
this
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
for
the
reason
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
even
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
the
reason
is
that
the
court
--
that
the
court
has
indicated
that
a
three-judge
court
is
to
be
convened
only
where
there
is
to
be
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
a
federal
statute
and
the
mere
asking
for
an
injunction
in
other
respects
or
the
mere
asking
for
the
invalidation
of
the
statute
so
a
declaratory
judgment
doesn't
trigger
the
three-judge
court
provision.
now
this
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
yes.
the
case
that
i'm
about
to
cite
to
your
honors
is
the
case
of
flemming
against
nestor
which
was
decided
two
terms
ago
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
and
we
think
it's
quite
close
for
this
reason.
there
was
in
that
case
--
the
social
security
administration
had
denied
social
security
benefits
to
nestor
because
he
had
been
deported
for
certain
reasons
and
under
the
statute
he
was
no
longer
entitled
to
benefit.
he
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
that
provisional
statute.
and
of
course,
he
was
denied
relief
by
the
administrators.
and
he
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
not
asking
for
a
three-judge
court,
but
under
the
special
provision
of
the
social
security
act
which
provides
a
review
by
a
single-judge.
and,
he
--
the
question
--
this
court
preserved
the
hearing
on
the
merits,
the
issue
of
whether
there
should
have
been
a
three-judge
court.
and
the
court
decided
on
that
time
that
in
that
particular
--
in
that
kind
of
case,
where
he
was
seeking
a
review
of
the
denial
of
benefit
even
though
it
was
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right
and
the
same
is
true
here,
because
this
is
being
brought
under
section
503
of
the
nationality
act.
perhaps,
if
i
complete
my
statement
of
the
flemming
case
or
the
nestor
case,
i'll
be
able
to
show
the
analogy,
which
we
think
exists.
the
court
there
said
that
even
though
the
district
court,
the
single-judge
court,
had
the
power
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
in
reviewing
the
denial
of
benefits,
it
didn't
seek
--
the
case
didn't
seek
an
injunction
against
the
operation
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
and
therefore,
a
one
judge
court
was
proper,
and
it
upheld
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
and
went
on
to
the
decide
the
merits.
now,
the
analogy
that
we
think
exist
in
this
case,
that
this
is
too,
also,
being
brought
under
a
special
provision
of
the
statute,
section
503
of
the
1940
act
which
provides
for
a
declaratory
relief
against
denial
to
citizenship
claims
by
the
administrators.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
i
think
in
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
think
in
flemming
and
nestor
that
--
that
--
i
do
not
recall
that
they
ask
for
an
injunction
in
addition
though
they
may
have.
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
but
what
they
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
what
they
basically
ask
for
was
a
determination
that
the
statute
was
invalid,
and
therefore,
that
the
administrator
was
wrong.
here,
what
is
being
asked
is
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
in
fact,
the
very
first
--
said
portion
of
the
complaint
on
page
21
says
“this
is
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
under
the.”
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes,
but
compared
to
the
complainant
in
the
court
came
where
they
ask
for
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
and
enforcement
of
the
statute
not
only
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
a
particular
administrative
decision.
i
do
not
recall
at
the
moment
whether
in
flemming
and
nestor,
though
it
may
have
been,
but
i
don't
recall,
they
added
on
to
their
original
review
relief
provision
--
request
for
relief.
and
they're
--
and
also
to
enjoin
the
secretary
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i'm
not
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i'm
not
certain
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
--
whether
they
had
it
or
not,
but
i
think
it
would
have
made
a
difference
if
they
had.
i
think
that
if
they
had
sought
--
follow
the
statutory
proceeding
of
the
social
security
act
and
had
asked
for
what
they
ask
that
had
then
added
a
catch
off
phrases
here
asking
for
an
injunction
against
the
secretary
to
prevent
him
from
enforcing
the
statute
against
it
or
denying
relief.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
that's
a
different
thing
from
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
as
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
yes,
yes.
i
agree
with
that.
but,
if
i
come
back
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
come
back
to
the
thing
i
said
before
mr.
justice
brennan
that
where
there
is
a
statutory
proceeding,
a
special
statutory
proceeding
such
as
existed
in
flemming
and
nestor,
and
as
we
think
exist
here,
a
special
statutory
proceeding
will
have
more
to
say
about
this
in
the
next
case,
but
it
applies
here
where
there
is
a
statutory
proceeding
for
review,
in
here
it's
called
the
declaratory
judgment
type
of
action.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
this
is
not.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
this
is
under
the
special
provision.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
1503
(a)
of
title
8
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
--
is
a
special
provision.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
but
it
provides
a
special
provision.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
and
our
argument
is
that
whether
there
is
a
special
provision
of
that
kind
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
it
is
only
triggered
if
there
has
been
an
administrative
denial.
it
is
not
precisely
the
same
as
the
kind
of
review
you
have
in
a
labor
board
case
but
you
can
just
start
it.
if
you
think
you
want
a
declaration
of
your
nationality,
you
have
to
had
an
administrative
--
a
final
administrative
denial
of
your
plan,
and
that
triggers
the
special
statute
and
when
you
--
when
a
review
proceeding
is
brought
under
this
--
a
special
statute
of
that
kind
as
in
flemming
against
nestor,
and
where
you
are
really
seeking
a
review
in
reverse
of
an
administrative
determination
of
nationality
as
it's
true
in
flemming
against
nestor,
we
think
that
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
mr.
justice,
i'd
say
again
that
if
in
the
nestor
case,
the
plaintiff
there
had
raised
--
and
there
had
said
four
after
the
review
proceeding
and
declaratory
judgment
and
we
seek
an
injunction
against
the
secretary's
denying
benefits
to
may
--
on
the
ground
of
the
invalidity
of
the
statute.
i
think
that
the
decision
of
the
court
would
not
have
been
any
different
than
it
was,
and
that
the
court
would
have
said
that
a
single-judge
could
properly
have
--
hear
the
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
think
that
is
in
the
course
of
decisions
of
the
court
that
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
the
court
has
indicated
that
there
can
be
determinations
of
unconstitutional
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
think
that
has
always
been
the
interpretation
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
i
think
the
issue
is
never
been
decided
but
i
think
that
has
been
the
course
of
interpretation.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
the
congress
provided
an
injunction
because
they
were
interested
in
not
stopping
the
wheels
of
administration
from
going.
an
injunction
has
an
effect
which
is
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
oh,
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
--
i
think
that
that
he
would
enforce
(voice
overlap)
the
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes,
if
it
were
decided
by
a
lower
court,
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that
made
me.
i'm
not
aware
of
that.
but
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
--
and
i
think
that's
one
reason
why
the
congress
passed
28
u.s.c.
1252
providing
for
a
direct
appeal,
because
where
there
--
and
that's
not
limited
to
injunctions
that
can
cover
declaratory
judgments
any
kind
of
civil
proceedings.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
think
the
idea
originally,
and
of
course
it
came
in
with
relations
to
state
--
of
state
legislation.
it
came
in
long
before
there
were
a
declaratory
judgment
or
at
least
before
they
come
long
before
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
passed.
and
the
common
way
of
proceeding
in
those
cases
was
to
enjoin
a
state
from
enforcing
a
particular
statute.
of
course,
it
was
only
--
the
only
people
who
could
take,
what
shall
i
say,
benefit
of
it
were
the
plaintiffs
and
those
incriminated.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
i
think
that
congress
didn't
care
about
single-judges
saying
that
state
statutes
were
unconstitutional.
it
didn't
want
single-judges
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
the
statute,
so
that
the
entire
administrative
procedure
or
whatever
it
was
under
the
statute
would
come
to
halt.
i
think
that
that's
true.
then,
i
think
history
is
also
showing
that
there
is
kind
of
narrowing
in
the
eyes
of
congress
of
the
impact
of
the
three-judge
court
provision,
so
that
as
time
went
on,
and
it
was
applied
to
the
federal
government
later,
and
then
as
time
went
on,
this
court
indicated
that
there
could
many
decisions
of
unconstitutionality
without
have
--
without
a
three-judge
court
by
a
single-judge
court.
and
then
in
1937,
in
the
new
deal
days,
the
congress
put
in
its
provision
that
i
stressed,
the
1252,
where
a
single-judge
could
do
it
because
they
understood
that
there
would
be
proceedings
where
a
single-judge
would
hold
the
statute
of
un
--
unconstitutional
of
federal
statute.
they
want
a
quick
review,
but
i
think
that
the
difference
--
there
is
a
difference
between
quick
review
in
this
court
which
they
didn't
want,
and
provision
for
a
hearing
by
a
three-judge
court
which
they
were
willing
to
leave
in
the
terms
of
which
it
had
classically
been
an
injunction
against
the
operation
or
enforcement
of
the
statute.
that
mr.
justice
is
our
position.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
resident
alien?
no.
there
are
no
--
it
could
be
prosecuted.
i
don't
know.
i
haven't
looked
up
the
decisions
relating
to
resident
aliens.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
we
say
that
both
citizens
and
resident
aliens
would
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
--
i
come
then
to
the
collateral
estoppel
issue
which
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
--
which
you
are
talking
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
don't
think
judge
jertberg's
decision
has
to
do
with
resident
aliens.
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
man
who
was
a
citizen
and
then
left
the
country
and
lost
his
citizenship
under
section
401
(j)
which
was
enacted
in
1944.
there
are
other
decisions
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
i
don't
think
you'll
have
to
decide
the
resident
alien
point,
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
only
possible
relevance
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
estoppel
and
if
i
may
expatiate
a
little
on
that
which
is
the
other
uncons
--
nonconstitutional
issue
in
the
case,
our
--
let
me
recall.
the
court
raised
this
issue
sua
sponte,
gave
permission
to
the
parties
to
amend
the
pleadings
and
send
the
case
back.
the
appellee
did
amend
his
complaint
to
raise
this
issue.
there
was
no
hearing
in
the
district
court
in
the
sense
that
there
was
oral
evidence
or
affidavits.
there
was
an
oral
argument
by
the
parties,
and
judge
jertberg
decided
against
the
appellee.
he
rejected
the
issue
of
the
defense
of
collateral
estoppel
and
he
put
it
that
way.
and,
of
course,
we
think
he
was
correct.
now,
the
facts
with
relation
to
that
are
all
in
the
indictment
in
criminal
judgment
of
the
--
in
the
earlier
1947
proceeding.
and
they
appear
in
the
record
and
that
it
appears
the
2426
and
the
judgment
of
2728.
what
happened
in
1947
is
that
there
was
this
indictment
returned.
the
defendant
pleaded
guilty
to
count
one
of
the
indictment,
count
one
was
a
provision
that
charged
him
with
evading
service
in
the
draft
by
going
to
mexico
and
remaining
there
until
on
or
about
november
1st,
1946.
but
it's
very
important,
i
think,
for
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel
that
the
indictment
didn't
charge
that
he
was
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
it
said
as
you
will
see
on
page
24,
franc
martinez-mendoza,
a
male
person
within
the
class
made
subject
to
selective
service
under
the
selective
service
and
training.
and
the
reason
why
that
was
said
was
that
the
selective
service
and
training
act
related
not
only
to
citizens
of
the
united
states,
but
to
resident
aliens.
it
covered
all
citizens
and
resident
aliens,
and
it
was
common
to
phrase
indictments
in
the
term
--
in
the
general
terms.
and
so
--
now,
what
happened
--
what
happened
was
that
the
defendant
pleaded
guilty
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
there
would
be
no
--
we
think
there
was
no
collateral
estoppel
even
he
were
a
citizen
as
i
will
to
try
to
point
out
which
i
think
it
was,
but
i
think
there's
--
the
whole
problem
of
collateral
estoppel
arises
from,
i
think,
the
definition
of
that
principle
is
very
different
from
res
judicata
which
says
that
if
you
have
the
same
cause
of
action,
anything
that
was
or
could
have
been
raised
in
first
cause
of
action
is
conclusive.
collateral
estoppel
is
different.
it
provides
that
the
parties
are
bound
only
by
those
issues
which
were
actually
litigated
in
the
earlier
case
or
were
necessarily
included
in
the
judgment.
and
since
clearly
here,
the
causes
of
actions
are
different,
it's
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
that
applies.
as
i
will
try
to
show
in
the
next
few
minutes,
neither
branch
of
the
doctrine
of
federal
estoppel
applies
here.
it
wouldn't
actually
put
in
litigation
--
litigation
the
issue
of
citizenship
because
the
government's
indictment
didn't
say
anything
about
the
citizenship.
he
was
a
male
person
subject
to
the
act,
and
he
pleaded
guilty,
and
the
judgment
is
in
the
same
term.
so,
the
issue
of
citizenship
was
never
put
in
litigation.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
he
could
have
put
in
litigation
but
he
did
not,
because
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
he
could
have
put
it
by
pleading
not
guilty
and
denying
that
he
was
subject
to
the
act.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
subject
to
the
act.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
1942.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
1942.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
1944.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
or
resident
aliens.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes
but
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
oh,
i'm
sorry.
you
mean
the
expatriation
act
for
the
part.
so,
the
selective
service
act
applied
to
resident
aliens
all
along.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
it
applies
from
the
beginning
to
resident
aliens.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
or
this
from
any
time
it's
relevant
to
this
case.
it
applies
to
resident
aliens
as
well
as
to
citizens.
the
issue
was
not
actually
put
in
litigation.
now,
was
it
necessarily
decided
by
the
judgment?
and
i
think,
it's
important
to
say
that
the
rule
is
generally
stated
that
it
has
to
be
clearly
necessarily
decided
not
a
mere
matter
of
speculation.
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
think
that
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
i
think
that
he
--
it
would
have
got
in
much
good
to
put
it
an
issue
because
he
would
have
been
liable
even
if
he
were
just
a
resident
alien
before
he
went
to
mexico.
and
--
but
if
he
thought
that
for
other
purposes,
it
was
important
for
him
to
get
a
decision
in
the
litigation
that
he
was
or
was
not
a
citizen,
i
think
he
could
have
put
an
issue
by
asking
for
bill
of
particulars.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
he
was
a
resident.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
but
he
was
a
resident
of
the
united
states.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
yes.
what
i'm
saying
to
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
if
he
thought
it
was
necessary
to
get
himself
a
determination
in
the
criminal
case
as
to
whether
he
was
a
citizen
or
not,
he
could
have
raised
that
issue.
i
don't
think
it
would
have
done
him
any
good
in
the
criminal
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that
is
the
basis
why
i
think
that
there
was
no
collateral
estoppel
here.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
true.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes,
you
are
quite
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
done
no
good
because
the
fact
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
he
could
have.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
but
the
whole
gist
of
this
offense
occurred
in
1942.
that's
the
gist
of
the
offense
when
he
was
clearly
a
resident
alien
or
fairly
a
citizen.
before
the
expatriation
act
occur
for
the
past
in
september
27th,
1944.
that's
the
gist
of
the
offense.
that's
the
gist
of
count
one
as
shown
by
the
other
two
counts
which
the
district
judge
in
the
criminal
case
thought
cast
light
on
the
first
count.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
not
necessarily
at
all.
this
court
has
held
that
in
the
chew
against
colding
case
that
a
man
who
was
a
resident
and
was
debarred
at
the
port
from
coming
back
was
still
a
resident
of
the
united
states
because
he
had
lived
here
so
long,
and
there
was
no
showing
that
he
had
given
up
his
residence,
so
that
--
it
isn't
true
at
all,
i
think,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
there
were
no
facts
because
there
was
a
--
this
was
a
plea
of
guilty.
but,
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
mr.
justice,
is
that
he
would
have
been
guilty
of
this
offense
even
if
he
gave
up
his
residence
when
he
went
abroad
because
he
was
at
the
time
he
was
in
the
united
states
subject
to
the
draft
as
a
citizen
or
as
a
resident
alien,
and
that
by
going
abroad,
he
did
not
absolve
himself
from
the
criminal
offense
which
had
already
been
committed.
i
should
--
some
question
has
been
raised
by
the
appellee
as
to
the
use
of
the
language
in
the
indictment
and
that
they
remain
until
on
or
about
november
1946.
i
would
like
to
say
it
was
--
we
think
that
those
words
were
unnecessary
for
the
indictment.
there
were
surplusage,
but
if
they
hadn't
been
there
if
it
just
said,
and
they
remain,
the
indictment
would
have
been
a
good
indictment.
i
will
also
that
we
do
not
think
that
we,
the
government,
would
have
been
able
to
rely
upon
this
criminal
conviction
as
res
judicata
for
the
period
up
to
november
1st,
1946,
if
the
tables
had
been
turned.
that
is
i
don't
think
that
we
would
have
been
able
to
rely
upon
this
indictment
and
the
conviction
as
showing
that
this
man
had
gone
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft,
and
remain
there
up
to
and
until
november
1st,
1946.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
judge
jertberg
did
that
because
the
government
objected.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
the
government
objected
it
was
beyond
the
scope
of
the
action
and
if
the
court
please,
there
is
additional
reason
for
the
government's
having
objected
which
i
wanted
to
bring
out
exactly
at
this
time.
under
the
general
prodding
i
must
say
of
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
should
point
out
that
we
went
through
a
pretrial
procedure
in
this
case
pursuant
to
rule
16
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
as
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
is
well
aware,
that
rule
explicitly
provides
for
amending
the
pleadings
to
correct
earlier
errors
and
as
does
rule
15
of
course
also
provides
for
amendment.
but
what
is
important
about
rule
15
which
relates
specifically
to
amendment
is
that
it
provides
that
any
amendment
which
is
accomplished
relates
back
to
the
original
pleading.
in
other
words,
the
rule
says
in
just
about
so
many
words,
the
pleading
as
it
is
amended
shall
be
deemed
a
pleading
which
was
originally
before
the
court
so
that
the
excessive
zeal
which
i
exhibited
in
drawing
this
prayer
was
cured
by
virtue
of
the
explicit
terms
of
rule
15.
and
on
that
ground,
in
addition
to
the
inherent
ground
that
it
was
beyond
the
scope
of
the
action
per
se,
but
on
the
ground
of
the
pretrial
stipulation
as
well,
the
government
rightly
objected
to
any
additional
ancillary
relief
being
granted
in
judge
jertberg's
order,
and
judge
jertberg
correctly
refused
me
the
additional
ancillary
relief
which
i
sought.
therefore
your
honor,
i
submit
that
under
rules
15
and
16,
the
court
correctly
proceeded
and
what
is
more
important,
the
correction
that
it
made
and
in
--
contained
in
its
final
judgment
was
a
correction
which
by
virtue
of
rule
15
related
back
to
the
original
pleading.
i
have
returned
again
today
to
take
up
the
additional
time
of
the
court
because
we
did
not
reach
at
all
the
--
neither
mr.
davis
nor
myself
reached
at
all
the
ultimate
question,
the
constitutional
question
and
in
any
time
i
take
up,
i
realize
that
it
has
been
many
times
argued
here
and
argued
by
men
of
far
greater
experience
and
wisdom
than
i
have.
nonetheless,
perhaps
the
mendoza
case
is
destined
to
be
the
bellwether
case
and
it
would
be
improper
for
me
not
at
least
to
make
some
brief
contentions
on
the
basic
question
of
constitutionality.
without
rehearsing
the
briefs,
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
one
specific
question.
it
is
possible
on
one
theory
or
another
with
a
very
sharp
knife
to
divide
trop
versus
dulles
from
mendoza.
but
there
is
one
basis
on
which
it
cannot
be
divided
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
say
that
in
mendoza,
there
is
no
punishment
involved
whereas
in
trop,
401
(g),
there
is
punishment
involved.
that
i
submit
is
an
indefensible
distinction.
every
bit
of
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
originating
as
it
did
with
the
attorney
general
and
proceeding
through
legislative
argument
in
the
citations
that
we
have
given
to
the
court
shows
that
it
is
plainly
coercive
statute.
and
this
i
submit
is
a
pivotal
question
because
if
it
is
punitive,
if
section
401
(j)
is
a
punitive
statute,
i
submit
that
it
plainly
violates
procedural
due
process
of
law.
and
this
is
of
crucial
importance
because
of
the
often
repeated
inclination
or
in
the
determination
of
this
court
not
to
limit
or
affect
the
power
of
congress
if
it
can
conceivably
be
avoided.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
it
could've
hung
him
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
think
it
is
extremely
coercive
but
it
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
didn't
mean
to
slide
at
all,
i
meant
them
as
a
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
may
i
then
use
the
word
penal
and
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
--
suggest
that
that
reaches
the
question
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no.
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
at
all
because
i'm
suggesting
indeed
that
they
could've
hung
him.
but
they
couldn't
have
hung
him
on
the
statute
like
401
(j)
because
there
is
no
criminal
procedure
provided
for.
it
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
understand
your
honor
and
for
that
reason,
i
adopt
and
henceforth
intend
to
use
the
word
penal
hoping
that
it
is
as
unambiguous
a
word
as
i
could
select.
i
submit
that
this
is
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
it
--
your
honor,
it
could
not
impose
a
penal
sanction
like
401
(j)
because
401
(j)
is
procedurally
defective
aside
from
the
power.
now,
that's
another
question
and
i'm
aware
of
your
honor's
views
on
the
question
of
whether
congress
ultimately
has
that
power.
what
i'm
trying
to
reach
now
is
the
question
of
whether
congress
went
about
it
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
and
i
submit
that
401
(j)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no
your
honor
and
i
hope
that
the
selection
of
the
word
penal
eradicates
any
ambiguity
that
might
otherwise
have
existed.
i
submit
that
this
if
the
statute
in
trop
is
penal,
this
is
a
penal
statute.
if
it
is
a
penal
statute,
it
is
violative
of
procedural
due
process
of
law
because
it
provides
for
loss
of
citizenship
instantaneously
per
se,
a
united
states
attorney
may
ordain
if
this
happened
and
the
only
remedy
in
effect
is
to
come
in
and
say,
“alright.
you
say
i'm
an
alien.
i'm
pleading
as
an
alien
but
you're
wrong,
i'm
a
citizen.”
it's
a
civil
proceeding
in
declaratory
relief.
it
is
not
a
criminal
proceeding
which
guarantees
to
the
defendant
those
protections
which
are
fundamental
to
due
process
of
law,
to
procedural
due
process
of
law.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes
your
honor
and
those
other
protections
which
are
elementary
in
which
i
don't
think
the
court
wants
me
to
rehearse
here
which
are
necessary
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
your
honor,
i
would've
thought
that
it
was
of
course,
to
all
of
us
who
have
labored
on
this
side
of
the
wall
thought
so.
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
valid
distinction
to
be
made
now
that
perez
has
been
decided
in
that
this
court
has
held
that
there
is
vested
in
the
government
an
inherent
right
by
virtue
of
its
sovereignty
or
by
virtue
of
the
foreign
affairs
power,
it
doesn't
really
matter
very
much
which
you
say
it
is,
but
in
any
event,
the
government
has
the
power
to
separate
its
citizens
from
its
non-citizens.
to
set
out
certain
acts
which
--
whether
the
person
subjectively
intended
it
or
not,
nonetheless
are
of
such
a
character
that
must
necessarily
result
in
a
divestment
of
their
citizenship.
that
is
the
acts
have
a
rational
nexus
to
the
abandonment
of
citizenship.
in
a
sense,
perez
is
not
divorced
from
perkins
versus
elg
in
the
older
cases
which
said
in
effect
that
expatriation
is
the
voluntary
relinquishment
of
nationality.
perez
says
as
savorgnan
said
that
the
standard
must
be
objective,
the
petitioner
will
not
be
hurt
to
come
into
court
and
say,
“well,
i
didn't
really
mean
to
do
that”
and
there's
a
lot
of
sound
ground
for
that
mr.
justice
stewart
because
suppose
the
act
were
a
voluntary
signing
of
a
pledge
of
allegiance
to
the
british
flag
and
then
the
petitioner
later
came
in
and
said,
“well,
i
didn't
know
what
i
was
doing,”
the
government
is
entitled
to
count
on
certain
acts
as
manifesting
a
desire
to
change
allegiance.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
in
perez
the
petitioner
was
being
punished.
he
was
found
to
have
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
oh,
yes,
indeed.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
true.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
without
being
discourteous,
i'd
have
to
turn
the
question
around
and
say
how
could
it
be
non-punitive
here
if
it
--
if
it
was
punitive
in
trop
which
four
members
of
the
court
explicitly
held
it
to
be
and
i
think
inevitably
one
must
derive
from
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion,
the
same
result
that
it
was
nakedly
a
punitive
statute,
but
i
don't
mean
to
beg
the
question
your
honor.
i
am
trying
to
distinguish
perez
and
say
that
although
those
of
us
who
fall
on
the
other
side
of
this
urged
otherwise,
nonetheless
it
can
now
still
be
said
that
perez
is
a
regulated
statute
because
the
government
has
got
to
be
able
to
go
out
into
this
world
and
say
of
its
citizens
or
alleged
citizens
abroad,
these
are
our
citizens.
these
are
the
people
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
flag
and
these
over
here
are
not
citizens
and
on
the
basis
of
that
power,
which
seems
to
me
stated
that
way
to
be
an
inherent
attribute
of
sovereignty
if
it
is
not
part
of
the
foreign
affairs
powers,
on
the
basis
of
that,
perez
can
be
justified
as
a
non-penal
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
your
honor
i
think
it
is
of
no
significance
at
all
because
the
record
is
utterly
devoid
of
the
slightest
indication
that
mendoza
ever
asked
to
be
a
mexican
citizen.
the
british
empire
tomorrow,
the
parliament
can
adjudicate
everybody
in
this
room,
a
subject
to
the
british
crown
if
it
so
desires.
we
have
no
control
over
that
act
anymore
than
mendoza
had
control
over
what
the
mexican
constitution
said
about
the
nature
of
his
birth
which
happened
to
be
that
he
was
born
of
persons
who
were
of
mexican
nationality.
now,
there's
more
to
it
than
that.
if
we
were
to
make
such
a
distinction
in
this
case,
we
would
be
creating
a
separate
class
of
citizens,
a
set
of
citizens
who
were
especially
subject
to
a
law.
if
this
is
the
pivotal
point
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
your
honor,
i'm
suggesting
that
if
that
were
in
the
mind
of
the
court,
the
court
should
consider
that
it
would
be
creating
improperly
a
special
second
class
of
citizens
who
would
be
subject
to
this
statute
where
those
who
had
not
been
ordained
to
be
citizens
of
the
british
empire
or
the
republic
of
mexico
or
whatever,
those
who
had
not
happened
to
have
fallen
into
that
category
would
be
relieved
from
the
impact
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no.
your
honor,
i
would
submit
this
and
this
was
a
matter
which
was
specially
considered
this
time
on
remand.
the
results
of
that
consideration
appear
in
a
very
careful
language
of
judge
jertberg
in
the
specific
finding
on
the
subject
in
which
he
finds
in
essence
that
the
petitioner
is
a
citizen
of
mexico
according
to
the
laws
and
constitution
of
mexico.
what
is
citizenship
in
mexico
if
the
court
please?
what
is
citizenship
in
bulgaria
or
in
hungary
or
in
russia
or
wherever?
citizenship
here,
we
understand
and
certainly
when
the
court
has
written
the
final
chapter
of
this
series
of
cases,
we're
going
to
know
more
about
what
citizenship
is,
but
we
have
a
pretty
good
idea
that
it
means
basic
protections,
basic
protections
of
american
rights.
but,
when
we
say
that
a
man
is
a
citizen
of
mexico,
he
may
be
persona
non
grata
for
any
number
of
reasons
which
are
beyond
the
knowledge
or
can
of
this
court.
citizenship
when
it's
extended
to
a
foreign
land
means
less
than
nothing.
it
can't
equally
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
send
for
example
a
man
to
bulgaria
behind
the
iron
curtain,
even
though
according
to
the
constitution
of
bulgaria,
he's
a
citizen
of
it.
to
make
the
distinction
upon
that
basis
your
honor
is
to
presuppose
that
citizenship
in
each
foreign
land
is
what
citizenship
is
here
and
i
don't
think
the
court
knows
that.
in
fact,
i
think
the
court
more
than
that
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
such
is
very,
very
far
from
the
case.
he
will
be
set
adrift
just
as
surely
as
well
as
the
court
because
mexico
may
declare
him
for
any
number
of
its
own
reasons
to
be
persona
non
grata.
and
i
can
inform
the
court
for
the
record,
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
that
long
ago
we
received
a
letter
from
the
mexican
consul
on
our
inquiry
that
he
was
not
welcome
in
mexico
because
he
had
insisted
on
relying
on
his
american
citizenship.
it
can't
be
before
the
court.
a
mexican
consul
can't
speak
for
the
mexican
government
and
i
don't
think
that
the
secretary
of
state
or
whoever
appropriate
officer
might
make
such
a
statement
and
mexico
would
make
it
but
it
has
been
made.
i
say
this
informally
for
the
court's
information.
citizen
or
not,
he
is
not
welcome.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
congress
could've
said
it
but
i
think
congress
would've
been
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
we
know
that
in
fact
it
was
not,
that
this
emerged
from
the
attorney
general's
office
as
an
additional
penal
sanction
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
united
states
attorneys
and
incidentally
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
brilliantly
develops
this
history
of
the
statute.
we
know
that
in
fact
it
wasn't,
but
even
if
we
didn't
know
where
the
statute
came
from
or
what
its
source
was
and
how
it
was
administered,
nonetheless,
i
would
submit
that
congress,
and
i
say
this
naturally
with
deference
and
respect,
would
have
been
indulging
in
a
sophistry.
a
tax
evader
or
a
bank
robber
who
goes
across
the
border
is
doing
the
same
thing
to
avoid
this
kind
of
sanction
and
the
third
answer
your
honor
is
how
can
we
say
this
now
of
mendoza
when
the
court
refused
to
say
it
in
trop.
here
was
a
man
who
had
taken
his
oath,
who
was
in
military
service,
who
was
in
a
combat
zone
and
who
then
deserted
and
the
court
refused
to
uphold
the
constitutionality
there.
now,
how
can
we
turn
to
a
man
who
has
not
yet
taken
that
oath
and
i
hope
everything
i
say
here
carries
with
it
no
implied
suggestion
that
this
was
not
a
seriously
criminal
act,
i
have
--
i
said
this
earlier
in
1959
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
response
to
his
questioning,
certainly
this
is
a
dastardly
despicable
reprehensible
criminal
act.
those
of
us
who
are
defending
this
and
defending
it
so
hard
or
doing
so
because
we
believe
that
it's
an
infringement
upon
a
constitutional
right,
but
getting
back
into
my
third
point,
mr.
justice
whittaker
we
could
not
say
that
congress
could
have
made
such
a
statute
in
mendoza
and
upholding
on
that
basis
after
this
court
has
held
that
congress
could
not
have
done
it
in
trop.
because
of
course
in
trop
they
didn't
contain
that
language
of
deemed
to
have
voluntary
relinquished
his
citizenship,
but
hypothesizing,
we
could
hypothesize
in
trop,
but
this
the
court
refused
to
do.
and
in
a
five
to
four
decision,
it
struck
down
the
constitutionality
of
the
deserter
who
had
taken
the
oath
of
office.
to
make
this
distinction
now,
if
the
court
please,
without
deluding
my
previous
contentions
would
be
to
reverse
trop.
i'm
virtually
at
the
end
of
my
time
and
i'd
like
to
reach
entirely
across
for
just
a
moment
all
of
the
considerations
which
are
so
magnificently
set
forth
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
i
couldn't
have
written
that
brief
if
i
have
worked
on
it
for
50
years
and
i'm
deeply
grateful
that
it
was
filed
on
behalf
of
my
client,
but
reaching
across
all
of
the
things
that
have
been
raised,
i
would
like
to
ask
this
court
for
a
moment
to
consider
the
question
of
ultimate
power.
the
chief
justice
speaking
in
trop
expressed
the
feeling
that
this
question
was
perhaps
behind
us
now
because
of
perez,
that
is
to
say
that
it
is
now
behind
us
whether
congress
in
certain
circumstances
has
the
power
to
take
away
citizenship.
and
of
course,
to
the
extent
that
perez
does
that,
i'm
not
entitled
to
speak
on
the
subject
at
this
point,
but
if
i
was
correct
in
my
earlier
assertions
that
perez
is
a
regulated
statute
that
is
that
there
was
a
proper
exercise
of
sovereignty
to
allow
the
united
states
to
separate
the
sheep
from
the
goats,
there
remains
before
this
court
the
question
of
whether
congress
per
se
as
a
penal
sanction
has
the
power
under
any
circumstances
no
matter
how
the
statute
is
drafted
to
take
away
citizenship
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
would
be
proper
here
to
reach
that
question
and
to
hold
that
congress
does
not
have
that
power.
and
this
is
why
i
say
that.
citizenship
is
the
status
which
allows
the
governed
to
contract
with
the
government.
citizenship
was
explicitly
recognized
in
our
sister
french
revolution
as
being
the
status
which
all
of
the
freed
people
attained
and
the
status
by
which
they
entered
into
their
--
to
the
great
contract
with
their
new
government.
here,
it
was
so
assumed
to
be
the
case
because
of
the
tradition
of
british
subjects
that
we
never
said
it.
and
i
submit
that
it
needs
saying
now
that
the
court
should
hold
as
inviolable
the
status
of
citizenship
because
it
is
the
status
by
which
the
governed
contract
to
enter
into
government.
that
is
to
say
it
is
the
source
from
which
the
constitution
arose
and
if
this
court
should
hold
that
congress
may
not
infringe
upon
that
status
because
it
is
infringing
upon
the
contractual
status
of
the
other
party,
of
the
people.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes
your
honor,
always.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
my
time
has
expired
mr.
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court.
as
seven
members
of
the
court
know
i
have
been
with
this
case
for
sometime
and
looking
at
it
simply
from
the
point
of
view
of
one
who
has
become
deeply
interested
in
the
constitutional
problem,
naturally
i
would
hope
that
we
will
reach
a
resolution
here
of
the
underlying
constitutional
problem.
unfortunately,
i
don't
have
the
luxury
of
proceeding
that
way,
i'm
a
lawyer
with
a
client
and
there
are
very
strong
preceding
arguments
which
must
be
made,
which
could
well
prevent
this
court
from
reaching
the
constitutional
problem.
representing
mr.
mendoza,
i
bring
those
arguments
with,
i
hope
with
the
same
conviction
as
i
bring
the
later
ones.
the
court
will
recall
that
the
present
remand
is
actually
for
the
trial
court
to
consider
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel,
which
was
raised
sua
sponte
from
this
court.
we
therefore
take
considerable
temerity
on
my
part
to
tell
the
court
what
theory
is
since
the
theory
came
from
a
court.
there
was,
however,
in
the
colloquy
that
took
place
between
counsel
for
the
government
and
the
court,
a
little
confusion
it
seem
to
me
remaining
when
it
was
done.
it
wasn't
quite
certain
at
least
to
me
as
a
listener,
what
act
it
was
that
the
government
was
supposed
to
have
done,
which
we
now
assert
estops
it
from
denying
the
citizenship
of
mendoza,
and
therefore
for
the
purpose,
perhaps
of
only
clarifying
my
own
mind
may
i
state
briefly
the
collateral
estoppel
theory
as
we
understand
it.
there
is
a
conveniently
even
set
of
dates
1942,
1944,
1946.
mendoza
left
in
1942.
in
1944
while
he
was
in
mexico,
the
section
401(j)
was
passed.
in
1946
he
returned
to
the
united
states.
subsequently
of
course
in
1947
he
was
convicted.
now
the
indictment
and
the
judgment
of
conviction
both
charge
him
with
departing
and
remaining
outside
of
the
united
states
to
avoid
the
draft
from
1942
to
1946.
so,
that
a
quantum
of
the
offense
is
established,
it
isn't
one
day
or
one
week
its
four
years,
1942
to
1946.
but
if
as
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
pointed
out
earlier,
in
1944
mendoza
was
instantaneously
denationalized
then
the
offense
was
impossible
for
him
to
commit
from
1944
to
1946.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right
your
honor,
but
under
401(j)
if
it
were
effective
he
would
not
have
been
a
citizen.
so,
we
assert
that
by
charging
mendoza
with
a
quantum
of
offense
from
1942
to
1946,
the
government
is
now
estopped
to
deny
that
he
was
not
a
citizen
during
that
period
or
to
put
it
otherwise,
the
government
is
estopped
to
deny
that
he
ever
lost
his
citizenship.
now,
the
court
sent
this
back
to
judge
jertberg
to
get
his
views
on
it.
judge
jertberg
opined
that
although
he
could
understand
the
argument,
he
couldn't
see
that
it
was
--
there
was
any
real
substance
to
it
for
this
reason.
if
the
offense
had
been
committed
for
five
minutes
or
10
minutes
or
a
year,
it
still
would
have
been
draft
evasion
and
he
would
have
been
convicted
of
it,
whether
he
is
convicted
of
it
from
1942
to
1946
or
1942
to
1944,
which
is
what
we
assert
would
have
been
required
to
prevent
this
estoppel.
well,
i
can
understand
judge
jertberg's
position,
but
i
think
he
fell
into
error
for
this
reason;
every
indictment
sets
forth
sufficient
facts
to
permit
the
trial
court
to
understand
the
total
quantum
of
offense.
it
would
be
a
rare
case
indeed
where
the
district
attorney
or
the
united
states
attorney
merely
accused
a
man
in
an
indictment
of
stealing
money.
he'd
say,
he
stole
a
$100
or
he'd
say,
he
stole
a
million
dollars
and
he
would
expect
that
the
trial
court
would
have
that
fact
very
much
in
mind
when
the
trial
court
rendered
the
judgment
in
the
case
or
at
least
pass
sentence,
granted
the
guilt
is
there
or
not
there.
but
the
extent
of
the
offense
would
then
be
for
the
court
to
consider
in
the
passing
of
sentence.
now,
judge
yankwich,
chief
judge
at
the
yankwich
of
our
southern
district
tried
the
criminal
case.
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty
so
there
wasn't
much
to
the
trial.
judge
yankwich
imposed
a
sentence
with
an
indictment
before
him
showing
a
four-year
offense.
we
submit
that
it
is
a
reasonable
inference
that
judge
jertberg
had
in
his
mind
a
four-year
offense
as
opposed
to
a
two-year
offense.
therefore
the
united
states
has
--
we
are
not
merely
doing
hyper
technical
logic
chopping
here,
there
was
something
real
in
judge
jertberg's
mind
when
he
sentenced
this
man
to
prison.
he
sentenced
him
for
a
four-year
offense.
we
submit
that
it
is
a
fair
inference
that
he
would
have
been
moved
to
mitigate
that
sentence,
if
he
had
known
that
the
offense
had
not
continued
after
1944
or
had
been
limited
to
two
years.
judge
jertberg
took
cognizance
of
my
argument
and
he
said
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
sustain
it.
i
submit
that
there
doesn't
have
to
be
anything
in
the
record
in
that
sense.
that
it's
a
reasonable
inference
that
every
judge
infixing
the
penalty
takes
into
account
the
extent
of
the
offense.
it
seems
to
me
also
if
the
court
please
that
this
court
can
reasonably
hold
in
favor
of
mendoza
on
the
basis
of
stare
decisis
in
that
trop
is
not
distinguishable
upon
any
substantial
ground.
to
me
the
attempted
distinctions
are
two;
one
is
that
401(j)
involves
the
offense
of
leaving
the
untied
states,
and
the
second
is
this
question
of
dual
nationality.
now,
with
all
respect
to
able
counsel,
i
was
not
sure
when
the
government
finished
whether
the
government
fully
conceded
that
this
element
of
dual
nationality
is
no
longer
before
the
court
or
whether
it
didn't.
so
i'm
going
to
have
to
proceed
as
if
it
is
still
before
the
court
although
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
conceded
more
in
this
direction
than
they
ever
had
before
here.
but
first
let
me
turn
to
the
other
branch
of
the
attempted
distinctions
from
trop
leaving
the
united
states.
it's
been
pointed
out
before
and
the
chief
justice
has
been
one
of
those
who
has
pointed
it
out,
that
the
tax
evader,
the
thief
or
anybody
else
leaving
the
united
states
is
essentially
on
no
different
ground
if
international
problems
are
created.
they're
probably
going
to
be
created
by
the
presence
of
such
an
offender
now
within
those
borders
and
as
judge
jertberg
as
i
crossed
to
point
out,
there
is
no
showing
here,
but
that
mendoza
was
not
a
peaceful
resident
of
mexico
throughout
his
term
there.
so
that
i
submit
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
that
the
leaving
of
united
states
injects
an
element
into
this
case
which
should
distinguish
it
from
trop.
it
seems
dubious
that
the
government
had
anything
like
that
in
mind
in
the
first
place,
if
the
court
pleases.
let's
look
at
how
they
framed
the
statute.
they
didn't
say
any
person
entering
any
foreign
state
shall
commit
something,
they
simply
said
leave
the
united
states.
now,
that
could
mean
going
out
in
the
middle
of
lake
michigan
for
all
of
that
and
i
hope
the
court
won't
take
me
as
being
facetious,
but
it
could
mean
that
going
beyond
the
10
mile,
limited
an
ocean
going
vessel.
if
the
government
seriously
was
concerned
with
the
presence
of
these
draft
evaders
within
some
foreign
state,
it
would
seem
reasonable
that
they
would
have
said
so
and
if
they
wouldn't
have
picked
this
awkward
phraseology
in
the
negative.
the
other
branch
of
this
question
of
distinguishing
trop
as
dual
nationality,
i
think
the
court
has
heard
enough
argument.
i
could
tell
from
the
questions
of
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
mr.
justice
white
that
they
have
also
had
it
brought
to
their
attention.
i
have
a
few
comments
to
make
because
there
is
other
ground
to
cover
and
i
don't
want
to
spend
too
much
time
on
it.
but
should
we
not
emphasize
in
the
first
place
that
this
question
of
dual
nationality
is
one
which
is
imposed
by
foreign
governments
by
their
laws,
by
their
enactment's,
rather
than
by
any
decision
or
act
either
of
the
individual
within
the
united
states
or
much
less
any
act
of
the
united
states
government.
the
--
as
i
--
i've
said
before
in
this
court,
the
british
parliament
tomorrow
can
pass
a
law
and
say
that
we're
all
still
citizens
of
england
and
i
guess
we
will
be
if
they
say
so.
now,
are
we
pay
to
--
then
say
that
if
the
british
government
picks
some
category
of
us
and
says
you
are
now
british
citizens
that
we
are
a
class
of
citizens
to
be
distinguished
from
the
rest
of
us
and
isn't
that
all
it
really
is
to
it?
of
course
mendoza
comes
from
a
certain
racial
strain
which
identifies
him
in
physical
looks
with
those
people
of
mexico,
but
he
was
born
in
kern
county,
california.
let
us
imagine
also
the
situation
of
the
american
citizen
who
is
also
a
dual
national
of
china.
now,
what
would
that
mean
to
him
by
a
way
of
substantial
benefits,
how
would
that
better
his
position
if
he
were
thrust
out
into
the
world.
can
we
not
well
imagine
reasonably
that
if
a
person
of
chinese
descent
went
to
communist
china
and
said,
“hi,
i'm
an
american
citizen
and
i'm
also
a
citizen
of
china”
that
the
net
reward
that
he
would
reap
for
this
would
be
to
be
hung
by
his
thumbs
or
whatever
else
they
thought
out
for
him.
the
idea
that
dual
nationality
ipso
facto
and
without
any
further
showing,
means
that
there
is
another
homeland,
another
haven
out
there
some
place
simply
can't
be
sustained
in
this
1962
world
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
a
real
heart
of
it.
there
has
been
something
i
have
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
before
to
hold
the
record.
i
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
at
the
instance
of
mr.
justice
whitaker
and
that
is
the
fact
that
we
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
by
virtue
of
a
communication
from
the
mexican
counsel
in
fresno
purporting
to
speak
for
the
mexican
government
that
even
mexico
wouldn't
accept
this
man,
if
he
had
clearly
renounced
his
mexican
citizenship
in
favor
of
his
american
citizenship.
now,
it
isn't
competent
evidence
and
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
how
i
could
get
to
the
government,
the
president
or
whoever
of
mexico
and
get
an
expression,
which
might
be
accepted
as
competent
evidence.
i
even
went
to
the
length
before
this
present
argument
of
importuning
mr.
dean
acheson
to
make
an
approach
which
he
might
be
able
to
make
much
more
effectively
than
i
could.
he
replied
that
he
didn't
think
it
was
appropriate
and
i
certainly
can
understand
his
feelings
about
it.
certainly,
i
never
would
undertake
such
an
approach
without
at
least
getting
permission
of
the
state
department.
for
my
own
part
the
argument
lacks
strength
because
i
don't
think
there
is
any
reality
to
it,
that
dual
nationality
doesn't
necessarily
mean
there
are
two
homes
in
the
first
place,
but
because
there
has
been
attention
given
to
it
in
this
court,
i
have
made
that
effort.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well,
i
know
why
he
went
to
mexico
mr.
justice
goldberg,
because
i
have
stipulated
to
that,
i
am
bound
by
it.
he
went
to
mexico
to
avoid
the
draft,
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
and
if
there
were
i
couldn't
raise
it
now.
and
this
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
think
it
was
a
geographical
accident.
the
mexican
people
who
come
from
via
lower
valleys
in
california
have
hundreds
of
relatives
down
here.
he
ran
there
because
that's
where
haven
was,
just
the
way
a
kentucky
boy
goes
back
into
those
kentucky
hills,
that's
where
the
haven
and
the
protection
is
and
to
mendoza,
that's
where
his
was.
if
he
had
been
living
in
some
other
part
of
the
united
states
was
more
remotely
removed
from
his
ancestral
beginnings,
he
would
have
avoided
the
draft
by
going
some
place
else.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
i
can
answer
that
unequivocally.
i
think
further
that
the
record
is
totally
devoid
of
any
showing
even
that
mendoza
knew
he
was
a
citizen
of
mexico,
much
less
was
choosing.
but
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
diverts
me
to
a
point,
which
has
been
raised
here
in
the
past
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
don't
think
that
on
that
later
occasion
i
did
a
sufficient
job
of
arguing.
what
he
has
asked
me
in
the
past
and
what
really
essentially
you're
asking
me
now,
is
whether
it
isn't
possible
to
postulate
this
entire
case
in
term
of
perkins
versus
elg
and
so
forth.
that
is
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
designate
certain
acts,
which
if
performed
indicate
without
more
an
objective
desire
to
relinquish
nationality.
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
lapse
of
time
is
the
reason
for
my
limited
answer
to
that
question
on
the
last
occasion.
back
in
1955,
i
wrote
a
special
amicus
brief
devoted
solely
to
that
one
single
point,
in
the
case
of
daniel
castaneda
gonzales
versus
landon
and
it
was
in
the
october
term
of
1955,
it
may
be
that
the
clerks
can
again
make
that
brief
available
but
let
me
say
briefly
this
about
it
now.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
111,
your
honor.
the
heart
of
this
short
brief,
which
i
wrote
on
the
subject
then,
is
heiner
versus
donnan
285
u.s.
312,
in
which
this
court
struck
down
the
device
of
the
conclusive
presumption
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
the
fact
which
is
relied
upon
to
give
rise
to
the
presumption
is
in
and
of
itself
conclusive.
and
to
say
it
another
way
so
that
there
would
be
no
misunderstanding,
this
court
went
further
and
said
that
constitutional
safeguards
are
not
to
be
avoided
by
the
device
of
the
constitutional
presumption.
now,
it's
necessary
to
go
one
step
further
into
other
decisions
of
this
court.
it
is
absolutely
true
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
in
cases
like
savorgnan
that
they
will
go
behind
the
doing
of
the
act
and
find
out
whether
in
the
back
of
his
or
her
head,
the
person
in
question
intended
to
give
up
the
citizenship,
but
in
the
savorgnan
case
and
the
other
related
cases
in
that
field,
the
act,
which
was
done,
was
itself
conclusive
and
by
that
i
mean
simple
renunciation
in
writing
of
american
citizenship
in
favor
of
canadian
citizenship
or
acts
of
like
character.
now,
in
those
cases
i
think
the
government
was
right
and
the
court
was
right
in
saying,
we
will
not
go
behind
such
a
simple
and
unequivocal
act
of
relinquishment
of
nationality,
but
if
mr.
justice
stuart
please,
that
isn't
what's
happened
here.
they've
tried
to
extend
those
sensible,
logical
cases
by
taking
a
thoroughly
equivocal
act,
an
act
from
which
any
number
of
reasonable
inferences
can
be
drawn
and
say
just
because
we
say
so,
if
you
do
this
you
lose
your
citizenship,
and
that
is
the
vital
difference.
i
have
developed
this
thought
a
little
further
in
this
older
brief
in
gonzales.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
it's
gonzales
verus
landon
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes
your
honor,
but
even
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
the
citation.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
perkins
versus
elg.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
don't
remember
it
your
honor,
i
am
sorry.
i
didn't
--
i
don't
believe
i
cited
it
in
his
brief
no.
well
i'm
not
yet
at
an
end
however
of
my
attempt
to
bring
to
the
intention
of
this
court,
those
basis
on
which
it
can
decide
in
a
favor
of
mendoza
without
reaching
the
question
of
the
ultimate
powers
of
congress,
because
if
we
can
show
here
that
this
is
a
penal
statute
and
mr.
justice
black,
we
mean
a
technically
penal
statute,
if
we
can
establish
that
the
government's
cause
is
done,
we
can
show
that
there
was
manifestly
no
procedural
due
process
of
law
as
we
understand
it
in
criminal
proceedings
and
we
bring
into
play
fully
and
without
any
limitation,
the
doctrine
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
but
the
threshold
to
all
of
this
is
the
question
of
whether
this
is
in
truth
a
penal
statute.
we
have
had
this
out
before
and
perhaps
members
of
the
court
will
member
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
had
a
rather
brisk
colloquy
on
the
subject,
which
went
on
for
sometime.
may
i
bring
to
the
attention
of
all
of
the
justices,
because
i
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
two
members
of
the
court
were
not
present
at
that
time,
those
elements,
which
we
believe
show
that
this
is
a
penal
statute
and
i
mean
a
technically
strict
penal
statute.
in
the
very
first
place,
expatriation
and
deportation
from
the
united
states
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
ancient
punishment
of
banishment
or
ostracism.
it
goes
back
to
the
beginnings
of
organized
society.
it
was
one
of
the
first
punishment
that
men
every
thought
off
for
themselves
and
yet
as
we
begin
to
civilize
ourselves
and
to
introduce
more
modern
standards
of
law,
we
abolished
this
punishment
as
a
particularly
cruel
and
unusual
one,
as
one
which
was
not
befitting
imposition
by
civilized
men.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
oh
yes
your
honor
that's
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
have
to
reach
to
the
record
for
support
to
show
that
this
actually
does
involve
deportation
as
well
as
the
loss
of
the
status
of
citizenship,
but
if
the
court
please,
that's
almost
self
executing,
because
(a)
he
committed
a
felony,
(b)
you
make
him
an
alien,
(c)
he
becomes
a
deportable
alien
under
the
terms
of
the
mccarran
act.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
oh!
yes
your
honor
it
always
has.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
think
that's
correct.
in
any
event
this
action
was
instituted
by
me
to
head
off
a
deportation
proceeding,
which
was
then
in
progress.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
it
was
completed
but
–-
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right
and
he
has
been
ordered
to
deported,
but
the
government
has
not
executed
upon
that
order
because
of
my
declaratory
relief
action.
it
therefore
seems
to
me
ironic
if
the
court
pleases
that
we
should
be
here
in
1962,
talking
about
a
statute
being
regulatory,
which
imposes
in
its
practical
effect
a
punishment,
which
was
so
primitive
in
its
characteristics
that
the
anglo-saxon
world
has
long
ago
abolished
it.
now
despite
the
agility
of
counsel
for
the
government,
he
was
unable
to
show
equally
that
the
civil
war
statutes
from
which
these
derive
were
not
penal
statutes
because
that
the
courts
call
them
this
and
by
inference
this
court
called
the
1965
statutes
penal.
more
than
that
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
in
colloquially
with
counsel,
both
the
house
and
the
senate
clearly
indicated
a
penal
intent
with
respect
to
the
imposition
of
this
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right,
your
honor
huber
versus
reily.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right,
your
honor.
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
but
i
think
in
kurtz
it
as
much
said
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right.
that's
correct,
but
it
has
not
so
squarely
held
that's
correct.
the
other
important
thing
it
seems
to
me
is
the
source
of
this
statute,
where
did
it
come
from?
did
it
come
from
the
state
department
to
implement
mexican
relations?
did
it
come
from
the
pentagon
to
implement
the
war
effort,
it
did
not.
it
has
been
clearly
shown
here
that
the
source
of
this
statute
is
the
justice
department.
it
was
an
effort
by
the
justice
department
to
do
what
it
thought
was
best
to
enforce
the
draft
act.
and
when
the
justice
department
requires
or
asks,
requires
is
certainly
the
wrong
word,
asks
of
congress
an
additional
tool
or
a
weapon
for
the
enforcement
of
an
otherwise
penal
statute,
surely
it
appears
on
its
face
that
the
last
bit
of
the
facade
has
disappeared
and
that
this
is
a
penal
statute.
common
sense
also
it
seems
to
me
requires
it,
to
send
this
man
to
jail
for
a
year
and
say,
that's
your
punishment
for
that,
and
then
to
come
after
him,
a
year
after
he's
finished
his
term
and
say,
now
you
also
left
the
united
states
in
the
commission
of
that
same
offense
now
we're
going
to
take
away
your
citizenship
for
that
and
deport
you,
but
that's
not
penal
is
to
stretch
credulity.
this
is
--
this
court
lives
in
a
world
of
reality.
i
don't
think
its
going
to
buy
that.
if
we
are
right
in
this,
if
these
cumulative
elements,
which
i
have
suggested
to
the
court,
show
that
this
is
in
truth
and
in
fact
a
penal
statute,
then
the
government's
case
as
i
have
suggested
must
fall,
because
there
was
no
trial
by
a
jury.
the
burden
in
the
first
instance
to
bring
this
action
was
placed
upon
the
petitioner,
rather
than
as
it
properly
should
have
been
upon
the
government.
the
statutes
did
not
provide
for
the
other
safeguards
which
are
traditionally
given
to
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
action.
equally
is
the
last
shred
of
distinction
between
trop
and
this
case
destroyed
by
virtue
of
the
same
argument.
and
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
trop
is
brought
into
full
play,
if
we
have
shown
that
this
is
a
penal
argument
and
i
submit
that
we
have.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
your
honor
any
kind
of
compulsory
deportation,
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
i
think
this.
i
think
that
the
--
it
is
within
the
power
of
congress
to
state
those
acts
which
in
and
of
themselves
conclusively
show
an
intent
to
voluntarily
relinquish
nationality
and
if
that
act
can
be
shown
in
a
civil
proceeding
to
have
been
done
then
i
would
say
no,
it's
not
a
compulsory
process.
if,
i
say
this
with
a
little
reluctance
because
of
my
overall
feelings
in
this,
but
i
think
it's
necessary
for
me
to
concede
it
to
give
logic
to
my
argument.
however,
where
congress
has
gone
beyond
the
traditional
form
of
compulsory
--
i'm
sorry,
voluntary
relinquishment
of
nationality
and
entered
into
the
field
of
using
the
device
as
a
punishment,
then,
yes,
whatever
the
offense
is
there
should
be
criminal
trial.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
your
honor
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
reach
that
here,
but
since
your
question
requires
me
to
reach
it,
i
would
still
argue
against
such
a
statute
because
i
don't
think
that
the
requisite
intent
would
be
shown
to
be
made
out
even
if
the
man
knew
that
he
has
such
a
citizenship.
now
if
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
suppose
the
statute
--
did
your
honor's
question
encompass
the
element
that
in
addition
to
knowing
that
he
was
a
citizen
of
the
second
country
that
he
intentionally
went
there
to
take
advantage
of
that
citizenship?
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
it
would
be
a
lot
closer
question
than
this
one,
where
we
do
not
have
those
elements
present
if
the
court
please.
i
have
not
yet
reached
the
question
of
what
the
inherent
powers
of
congress
are
and
of
course
i
should
again
deal
with
those
thoughts
as
time
permits
me
to.
i
remember
the
first
time
this
question
of
war
power
came
up
with
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
said
it
was
not
a
very
good
way
to
raise
an
army,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
his
first
reaction
on
that
--
at
that
first
argument
in
1959
states
pretty
succinctly
the
sum
and
substance
of
this.
it
really
is
not
an
effective
weapon
to
accomplish
the
purposes
alleged
for
it
even
if
we
adopt
the
fiction
that
it
was
enacted
for
that
reason
in
the
first
place.
we
know
why
it
was
enacted,
the
justice
department
asked
for
it,
but
if
we
go
into
the
fiction
that
we
were
thinking
about
the
enablement
of
the
government's
war
effort
at
the
time.
i
still
submit
that
there
has
been
no
showing
whatever
by
argument
or
by
any
other
reference
to
show
that
this
was
the
slightest
talk
to
the
war
effort.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
first,
i
think
it's
also
been
well
established
by
mr.
justice
goldberg's
questions
that
the
extent,
the
total
extent
of
this
offense
was
infinitesimal
in
comparison
with
the
total
war
effort.
secondly,
would
it
really
have
a
benefit
to
the
morale
unless
the
person
we
are
going
to
return,
let's
think
about
the
fugitive.
if
the
fugitive
has
left
and
is
going
to
keep
ongoing,
would
it
make
any
of
us
feel
any
better
that
we
had
taken
away
his
citizenship,
what
would
he
care
he
is
gone,
he
intends
to
stay
gone,
but
let's
suppose
he
changes
his
mind
and
decides
to
come
back.
now
when
he
arrives
at
those
gates
we
have
him
again
and
we
can
shoot
him
if
we
choose.
we
can
give
--
we
can
use
any
measure
of
penal
sanction
that
we
wish
to.
the
factor
of
the
improved
morale
only
occurs
when
we
do
something
to
him
that
he
doesn't
want
us
to
do
to
him.
if
he
has
gone
for
a
good
he
isn't
going
to
care,
if
he
comes
back
we
can
punish
him
a
lot
more
effectively
than
by
this.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
see
your
honor's
point.
of
course
my
answer
is
that
the
government
could
him.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes
i
understand
that.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes,
but
you
can
also
be
also
be
shot
for
it
congress
choose
is
it
do
to
you.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no,
but
there
could
have
been
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes
that's
right.
but
there
could
have
been.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
but
while
i'm
referring
your
honor
to
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brennan
when
he
said
there
are
other
things
we
could
have
done
which
would
have
been
more
effective.
in
effect,
i'm
agreeing
with
him
by
saying
yes
there
indeed
are.
we
could
have
adopted
a
conventional
penal
statute
of
greater
magnitude
which
would
have
punished
this
man
to
a
point
where
the
question
of
morale
or
any
other
question
would
have
been
fully
satisfied.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
possibly,
but
then
would
that
make
any
difference,
if
he
was
going
anyway
we
wouldn't
care.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
the
--
certain
comments
of
the
court
in
relation
to
the
application
of
the
foreign
affairs
power
have
led
me
to
believe
that
i
can
do
well
to
go
on
to
a
final
position
which
i
have
urged
here
before.
i'd
like
in
the
minutes
remaining
to
me
if
the
court
please
once
more
to
try
to
reach
across
these
arguments,
to
urge
upon
the
court
the
possibility
that
we
can
burst
out
of
this
thicket
that
we
have
been
in
all
these
years
and
out
into
the
sunlight
once
again
if
we
take
a
strong
clear
position
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
citizenship
itself.
what
is
citizenship?
what
is
to
be
a
citizen
as
opposed
to
be
a
government?
and
i
urge
upon
this
court
the
concept
that
in
effect
we're
back
at
the
time
of
marbury
versus
madison
again.
we're
back
when
decisions
were
being
made
by
this
court
which
established
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
various
basic
components
of
this
country.
in
marbury
of
course
it
was
the
court
itself
which
was
asserting
its
own
power,
but
on
various
early
occasions
this
court,
because
it's
the
only
instrument
to
do
so,
the
only
instrument
that
can
do
so,
has
stated
a
basic
position
as
to
the
power
of
the
component
itself.
now
i
speak
of
the
two
largest
components
of
all,
the
component
of
the
citizens
and
the
component
of
government.
and
this
in
a
democratic
theory
is
a
contractual
arrangement.
the
citizens
say
to
their
government
you
can
govern
but
only
in
such
terms
and
conditions
as
we
set
out
and
the
great
contract,
the
united
states
constitution
is
made.
and
i
urge
upon
this
court
once
more
the
thought
that
the
status
of
citizenship
itself
must
stay
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
destroy,
because
if
congress
can
destroy
the
status
then
congress
has
destroyed
the
contract.
if
there
is
no
opposite
contracting
party,
there
is
no
contract
anymore,
to
shoot
him
is
one
thing,
but
he
goes
his
last
mile
as
a
citizen,
to
destroy
his
status
is
to
destroy
everything.
the
chief
justice
has
said
it
in
different
way
and
in
a
different
light,
but
it
bears
upon
the
same
thought.
what
does
it
matter
how
hard
we
work
to
protect
the
basic
freedoms
in
the
bill
of
rights,
if
we
give
to
congress
the
right
to
take
them
all
away
through
the
back
door
by
this
device
of
the
involuntary
relinquishment
of
nationality.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
i
think
it
goes
deeper
than
that
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
it
certainly
bears
upon
it,
but
i
think
it
goes
deeper
than
that.
i
think
it
goes
to
the
very
basis
that
this
country
was
formed
on
before
there
was
a
constitution.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
not
quite.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
your
honor,
no
i
don't
think
so,
because
savorgnan
was
an
act
which
was
equivocally
a
relinquishment.
hare
to
me
with
all
deference
and
due
respect
is
an
equivocal
case.
i
can't
read
it
and
come
to
final
conclusions
over
it.
but
now
about
perez,
i
don't
think
this
court
need
overrule
perez,
even
though
as
an
interested
lawyer
i
wish
the
decision
had
been
otherwise.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right
your
honor.
i
think
i
can
illustrate
it
by
one
specific
illustration.
suppose
congress
had
passed
a
law
that
says
--
that
said
that
after
you
serve
your
term
for
draft
evasion
and
are
set
loose
in
the
united
states
again
you
shall
never
again
have
the
right
of
free
speech,
this
court
would
strike
that
statute
down
in
a
minute
and
yet
there
isn't
any
real
essential
difference
between
what's
happening.
the
other
things
that
your
honor
has
mentioned
are
privileges,
affirmative
privileges
of
citizenship,
certain
of
the
bonuses
that
come
with
it
and
surely
it
is
established
that
the
congress
has
a
right
to
limit
those,
but
to
takeaway
the
status
itself
is
to
takeaway
the
basic
freedoms
and
that's
what
the
chief
justice
was
saying.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no
sir
i
think,
if
there
is
a
basic
element
to
citizenship
it's
right
to
be
here,
always.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes.
it
could
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right
and
we
never
can
destroy
that,
because
that
goes
back
long
before
these
present
statutes
that
are
in
dispute,
the
right
of
voluntary
relinquishment,
certain
opinions
to
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
yes
he
can.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no
that's
a
sanction.
to
destroy
citizenship
is
to
destroy
the
basic
status
itself,
not
one
of
its
bonuses
or
exterior
attributes.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
he
has
got
a
right
to
be
here
and
that's
what
the
chief
justice
said
in
trop,
that
the
essence
of
citizenship
is
the
right
to
be
here,
the
right
to
remain
here,
even
if
you've
taken
away
these
other
exterior
attributes
and
the
contract
remains
intact,
because
what
you've
done
to
him
short
of
that
point
is
to
impose
sanctions
upon
him,
which
are
entitled
to
impose.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
no
that
was
the
statute
that
i
--
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
because
that
is
an
inherent
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
bill
of
rights,
which
gives
a
man
a
right
to
vote.
but
it
is
one
of
the
basic
american
freedoms
to
express
oneself
freely,
this
court
would
never
tolerate
a
statute,
which
took
away
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
after
release
from
incarceration.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
sir?
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
well
that's
right,
i
agree
with
that
and
i
think
it's
implicit
in
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
exactly
that
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
not
of
recent
years
your
honor,
but
i
certainly
think
that
the
reading
of
it,
particularly
as
this
court
spoke
in
wong
kim
ark,
and
i
was
astonished
to
hear
the
government
bring
that
case
to
the
court's
attention
again.
i
don't
think
that
1898
court
would
have
decided
this
case
any
other
way
than
as
i
urge
it,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
gives
to
the
congress
the
right
to
confer
citizenship
and
not
the
power
to
take
it
away.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
they
did.
mr.
thomas
r.
davis
they
did
your
honor,
certainly.
and
certainly
what
we're
doing
here
today
is
a
part
of
that
developmental
process.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
