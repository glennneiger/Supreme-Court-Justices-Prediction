mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
supreme
court.
there
are
as
we
see
it
four
issues
in
this
case.
first
is
the
fundamental
constitutional
issue,
that
is
whether
or
not
congress
can
take
away
citizenship
by
reason
of
a
person
remaining
abroad
for
purposes
of
avoiding
the
draft
particularly,
although
not
necessarily
limited
to
the
factual
situation
here,
where
he
is
an
american
citizen
by
birth
and
where
the
result
would
be
to
leave
him
stateless.
this
would
be,
if
the
court
were
to
reverse
the
court
below
on
the
basic
constitutional
issue,
the
first
case
in
the
history
of
this
country
where
an
american
citizen
by
birth
was
deprived
of
his
citizenship
through
an
act
of
congress.
the
second
issue
still
before
the
court
despite
the
absence
of
comment
by
the
district
court,
is
whether
or
not
the
presumption
is
a
valid
one.
since
i
think
we
shall
be
able
to
show
the
court
that
the
presumption
here
was
the
basis
of
the
decision
which
expatriated
dr.
cort,
namely
the
decision
of
the
nationality
board
and
the
department
of
state,
and
since
absent
the
presumption,
we
think
there
is
an
absence
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
under
the
mishawaka
doctrine.
our
third
point
is
of
course
that
there
is
no
clear
and
convincing
evidence
and
the
fourth
is
reliance
upon
the
huber
and
the
kurtz
case,
because
in
those
cases,
in
one
directly
and
in
the
other
by
adoption,
the
principle
was
laid
down
that
constitutionally
one
could
not
be
given
a
punishment
such
as
the
loss
of
citizenship
under
the
1865
statute
in
that
case,
without
a
trial,
whether
it
was
a
trial
by
a
civil
court
or
a
military
court,
but
a
trial
and
not
by
a
government
administrative
agency,
an
ad
hoc
group
appointed
in
the
department
of
state.
while
i
have
the
highest
regard
for
the
individual
members
of
that
board,
before
which
i
appeared,
they
still
do
not
represent
a
court
under
our
judicial
system.
and
now
i
want
to
briefly
turn
to
the
facts,
because
although
i
had
intended
to
rest
principally
on
the
constitutional
arguments
and
to
show
what
has
not
yet
been
shown
today,
although
it
was
so
ably
shown
earlier
by
mr.
davis
in
his
first
argument,
that
the
1865
statute
dealt
with
two
problems;
desertion
and
draft
evasion
and
that
the
disposition
of
this
court
in
trop
necessarily
required
the
same
decision
here.
but
on
a
rereading
of
the
record
and
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
not
only
this
case,
but
it
is
conceivable
that
the
preceding
case
maybe
decided
on
facts
or
could
be
decided
on
facts
less
than
the
constitutional
issues.
i
think
i
must
address
myself
to
the
facts
insofar
as
they
have
not
yet
been
brought
out.
now
i
shall
not
repeat
the
counsel
for
the
government
so
ably
and
for
the
most
part
accurately,
except
for
one
or
two
smaller
things
that
i
will
try
to
correct,
as
stated
as
the
facts
in
the
case.
dr.
cort,
as
the
record
shows
and
this
is
hardly
a
defense,
is
and
was
from
a
very
early
age
an
eminent
physiologist.
he
went
to
england
not
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
draft,
but
for
purposes
of
research
work
in
the
field
in
which
he
is
extraordinarily
competent
and
internationally
known
in
the
field
of
kidneys
and
physiology.
while
he
was
there,
he
did
have
correspondence
with
harvard
medical
school
and
here
the
government
is
slightly
in
error
as
to
the
dates,
because
it
was
before
he
received
his
draft
or
notice,
that
harvard
suggested
to
him
and
your
honors
will
read
the
record
here,
that
there
was
not
much
point
said
harvard
in
his
coming
there
since
although
his
department
head
thought
he
was
necessarily
and
should
be
free
from
the
draft,
other
people,
the
acting
being
different.
and
so
before
he
received
the
notice
of
february
9,
1953;
the
notice
sent
on
that
day
and
the
court
will
take
judicial
notice,
it
takes
several
days
to
get
to
england.
on
january
31
the
future
head
of
dr.
cort's
department,
this
appears
at
138
of
the
record,
wrote
him
and
said
he
thought
it
inadvisable
for
dr.
cort
to
take
the
job
and
dr.
cort
concurred
by
letter
dated
february
10.
then
came
the
various
notices
and
we
have
said
we
received
those
notices,
although
we
have
not
stipulated
as
to
when
they
were
received,
the
notice
is
to
report
for
examination
and
then
finally
came
the
last
notice,
the
significant
one
upon
which
the
indictment
is
based,
that
of
august
13,
1953
directing
dr.
cort
to
report
of
induction
on
september
14,
1953.
now
faced
with
this,
what
did
the
board
of
nationality
review
do?
it
said
that
on
december
29,
1952
dr.
cort
intended
to
teach
at
harvard,
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
between
december
29,
1952
and
february
9,
1953.
and
therefore
said
the
board
of
nationality
review,
we
rely
upon
the
presumption
that
in
remaining
away
in
disregard
of
draft
board
notices,
dr.
cort
remained
away
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
draft.
the
board
apparently
as
i
have
just
looked
at
the
original
record,
and
i
will
confirm
it
tomorrow,
did
not
have
before
it,
the
correspondence
with
harvard,
which
would
have
explained
that
dr.
cort
did
not
on
when
he
first
received
the
draft
board
notice
intend
to
go
to
harvard
because
about
ten
days
before
that
dr.
cort
had
been
told
by
harvard
that
it
didn't
want
him.
this
was
an
administrative
board
hearing,
it
moved
principally
with
oral
argument
from
me
and
a
few
exhibits,
and
it
is
quite
understandable,
quite
aside
from
the
constitutional
problems
involved,
that
the
board
was
a
little,
shall
we
say
sloppy
at
it's
handling
the
problem
and
didn't
have
all
the
evidence.
it
was
later
on
when
the
matter
came
to
the
district
court
that
the
government
came
out
with
the
few
more
exhibits,
the
correspondence
with
harvard,
which
clarified
the
harvard
picture,
but
hardly
showed
that
dr.
cort
was
remaining
abroad
for
the
purposes
of
avoiding
the
draft
and
so
when
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
your
honor's
may
have
that
issue
to
decide.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
the
--
that's
the
job
of
the
government
before
it
can
expatriate
dr.
cort.
it
must
prove
under
349(a)(10),
the
statute
is
set
forth
the
pages
two
and
three
of
my
brief
that
dr.
cort
was
remaining
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
draft.
it
must
make
that
value
judgment,
a
value
judgment
made
by
the
board
of
nationality
review
and
by
the
district
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
district
court
said
that
in
its
view
dr.
cort
had
remained
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
draft
because
said
the
district
court,
he
had
intended
to
take
a
job
at
harvard,
which
showed
that
he
was
interested
in
coming
to
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
i
must
admit
your
honor
that
i
had
concentrated
on
the
constitutional
issues
up
to
now,
but
i
do
think
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
dr.
cort's
affidavit,
the
only
sworn
document
that
there
is
here,
is
in
the
record,
in
which
he
denies
having
remained
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
draft
and
that
affidavit
is
not
contested.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
definitely
deny
that
there
has
been
a
trial
on
the
issue.
the
only
kind
of
a
trial
that
might
have
occurred,
which
would
have
comported
with
the
elements
of
due
process
would
be
a
trial
under
the
indictment
of
course
for
the
violation
of
the
selective
service
act,
and
that
trial
has
not
yet
occurred,
and
of
course
what
occurred
before
the
board
of
nationality
review
could
under
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
be
considered
a
trial
of
the
issue.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
it
does
and
we
come
down
to
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
your
honor
did,
and
we
relied
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
except
in
trop,
your
honor
was
dealing
with
a
military
trial
and
we
haven't
even
had
a
military
trial.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
this
is
one
of
the
rare
cases
where
i
would
not
mind
a
military
trial,
we
had
no
trial.
we
merely
had
a
board
sitting
there
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
as
i
indicated,
saying
on
the
basis
of
the
oral
argument
of
counsel,
correspondence
between
the
parties,
we
think
this
man
remained
abroad,
and
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
despite
his
sworn
statement
to
the
contrary
that
he
has
remained
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
draft.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
they
did
your
honor
and
of
course
i
address
myself
to
the
statutory
presumption
next.
we
think
that
the
statute
presumption
is
a
perfectly
irrational
one
falling
before
this
court's
opinion
in
tot
and
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
not
a
single
word.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
district
court
was
a
hearing
upon
affidavits.
dr.
cort
submitted
elaborated
affidavits
in
which
he
explained
why
he
had
remained
abroad,
a
matter
that
i
have
not
yet
come
to,
but
which
i
shall
have
to.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
government's
case
was,
and
he
had
correspondence
with
harvard
that
he
intended
to
have
job
at
harvard,
and
how
can
he
say
that
he
didn't
want
to
come
back
to
the
united
states?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
preciously.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
that
i
have
an
old
point
your
honor,
i'll
indicate
more
clearly
tomorrow,
a
claim
that
we
were
entitled
to
a
full
trial
and
that
the
statute
did
not
gave
the
constitutional
type
of
trial
to
which
were
entitled.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
add
to
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
but
i
would
go
a
little
farther.
it
could
not
be
constitutionally
valid
because
the
statute
provides
for
no
trial.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
is
it
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
in
considering
the
government's
basic
argument
that
this
is
a
statute,
which
has
a
relationship
to
the
far
relations
power
of
the
government
and
that
it
does
not
imposed
any
punishment,
one
might
be
well
to
consider
the
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
remarks
in
his
reflections
on
the
reading
of
statutes,
that
in
considering
the
construction
of
a
statute,
we
might
begin
by
reading
it.
and
if
one
does
read
section
21,
of
the
act
of
march
3,
1865,
the
progenitor
of
both
the
draft
desertion,
the
draft
evasions
and
the
desertion
provision,
one
sees
that
they
have
a
common
origin,
a
common
purpose
and
common
sanctions.
in
fact,
section
21
contains
in
the
very
same
sentence,
not
merely
the
same
section,
the
provisions
with
respect
to
draft
evasion
and
desertion.
now
the
statute
itself,
which
again
we
must
look
at,
is
a
statute
which
provides,
which
is
described
as
an
act
to
amend
the
several
acts
herein
after
passed,
to
provide
for
the
enrolling
and
calling
out
of
the
national
forces
and
for
other
purposes,
nothing
to
do
with
foreign
relations.
it
is
composed
of
27
sections,
all
of
which
deal
with
different
aspects
of
running
an
army
and
the
question
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
not
your
honor.
i
think
running
an
army
had
something
to
do
with
the
question
that
the
statute
dealt
with.
in
short
it
is
conceivable
that
a
statute
could
contain
the
provisions
relating
to
foreign
relations,
even
though
when
army
measure,
but
this
particular
one,
i
answer
your
honor
in
this
way,
this
particular
statute
dealt
only
with
the
question
of
how
to
run
the
economy
internally.
so
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no
if
there
were
any
part
of
the
statute
that
touched
on
foreign
relations,
i
would
say
it
would
not
be
necessary
too.
it
is
because
each
of
the
sections
taken
separately
deals
with
a
different
aspect
of
the
army,
such
as.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
1865
statute,
exactly,
and
your
honors
will
see
and
i
think
the
briefs
and
other
cases
have
indicated
that
the
history
isn't
unbroken
one
except
at
one
point
where
they
left
out
the
draft
desertion
provisions,
the
draft
evasion
provisions
in
1940.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly
your
honor.
now
as
i
said
mr.
justice
goldberg,
if
you
take
the
sections,
one
of
them
will
deal
for
example
with
the
question
of
bounties,
another
will
deal
with
the
question
of
soldier's
pay,
the
third
with
a
prohibition
against
allowing
insane
people
to
be
inducted
in
the
army.
nothing
at
all
suggesting
the
government's
present
argument,
and
somehow
rather
in
1865
there
was
a
conception
of
what
our
relations
were
going
to
be
with
other
countries.
now
i
will
come
to
the
government's
arguments
on
that
point
in
greater
detail.
now
the
particular
section
of
course
that
we're
dealing
with
here
has
three
subtitles,
two
of
them
are
significant;
penalty
for
desertion,
et
cetera;
and
leaving
the
country
to
avoid
the
draft
to
incur
like
penalty.
now
the
debates
on
the
subject,
which
i
don't
think
have
been
discussed
before
this
court
before,
likewise
indicate
a
concern
for
enrolling
in
army
and
not
a
concern
for
what
will
happen
if
somebody
leaves
the
country.
the
bill
itself
was
proposed
by
mr.
schenck,
chairman
of
the
military
committee,
representative
from
ohio
and
mr.
schenck's
remarks,
it
was
an
emergency
bill
i
may
say,
in
which
they
had
very
short
debate,
and
which
people
who
opposed
the
bill
were
called
traitors,
mr.
schenck
stated,
“here
is
a
penalty
that
is
lawful,
wise,
proper
and
it
should
be
added
to
the
other
lawful
penalties
that
now
exists
against
deserters.”
and
as
the
bill
was
originally
introduced
it
merely
referred
to
people
leaving
the
country,
but
congressman
wilson
of
iowa,
which
i
gather
was
a
state
with
hills
in
it,
moved
to
amend
the
bill
by
providing
that
anybody
who
left
the
district,
not
merely
the
country,
should
be
covered
by
this
statute
and
as
he
said,
“in
my
own
state,
and
i
presume
it
is
so
in
all
the
states,
as
soon
as
that
notice
is
given,
that
is
a
notice
of
induction,
many
persons
at
once
prepare
to
leave
and
do
leave,
going
into
the
territories
and
among
the
mountains
and
mines
to
avoid
the
services
of
a
country
in
the
event
that
they
are
being
drafted.”
well,
mountains
and
mines
in
iowa
and
the
relating
area
is
certainly
a
far
cry
from
mexico
or
czechoslovakia
or
england,
which
the
government
is
emphasizing
in
the
present
time.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
was
a
statute
--
but
that
is
exactly
the
same
statute
that
we
have
today,
except
we
have
eliminated
the
words
the
district,
that's
merely
a
formulation
of
words.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
if
they
were
your
honor,
any
reference
at
all
in
any
of
the
debates
that
followed
to
indicate
that
this
wasn't
merely
a
streamlining
of
the
statute,
then
i
would
have
to
recognize
some
weight.
but
there
isn't
a
word
in
the
period
from
1865
to
1952
that
suggests
a
different
policy,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
government
itself
in
its
brief
in
gonzales
against
landon,
says
that
the
purposes
of
the
current
statute
are
purposes
of
the
1865
statute.
now
i
would
take
them
if
they
were
there,
as
well
as
their
construction
which
i
rely
on
in
another
connection.
in
the
debate
i
may
say
in
1865
and
a
debate
that
followed,
all
the
speakers
emphasize
the
fact
that
this
was
a
question
of
punishing
people.
no
suggestion
made
of
any
effect
on
foreign
affairs.
in
1912
i
think
the
most
significant
report
is
a
report
number
335
at
the
62nd
congress,
which
is
a
report
from
the
committee
on
naval
affairs,
not
foreign
relations,
in
which
they
recommended
that
the
statute
be
amended
to
be
limited
only
to
peace
time.
and
that
there
again
the
chairman
of
the
committee
pointed
out,
in
using
the
words
punishment
and
penalties,
and
i
may
say,
cited
from
winthrop's
military
law
and
precedents
in
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
the
navy,
in
which
winthrop
pointed
out
that
this
was
a
war
measure.
no
again,
no
suggestion
that
it
would
have
had
anything
to
do
with
foreign
relations.
in
1940,
the
cabinet
committee's
report
was
considered
by
the
congress
and
your
honors
will
recall
that
the
cabinet
committee
included
on
it
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
please
sir.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
have
nothing
clear
enough
i
regret
your
honor.
i
was
not
adjusting
myself
to
the
question
of
power,
but
there
is
a
question
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
government
says
that
the
1865
statute
was
passed
because
the
government
was
afraid
that
it
might
have
some
--
the
situation
might
have
some
effect
on
foreign
relations.
i
referred
to
the
history
and
the
words
of
the
1865
statute
to
show
that
the
foreign
relations
concept
is
not
based
on
reality.
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we're
not
talking
about
power.
well
if
the
government
has,
i
was
addressing
myself
your
honor
to
the
question
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
not
the
power.
now
your
honor
is
suggesting
that
if
there
were
a
purpose
it
didn't
exist,
that
the
government
might
produce
it
now
to
justify
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
of
course
this
is
not
a
single,
i'm
only
addressing
myself
to
one
aspect
your
honors,
it
is
not
a
single
congressman,
it
is
a
full
sweep
of
the
congress.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
take
the
position
your
honor
passing
the
broader
question
of
power,
which
your
honor
has
reserved,
that
if
the
congress
passes
a
statute
intending
to
aid
the
war
power,
it
is
not
for
the
court,
most
respectfully
or
for
the
government
to
suggest
that
this
provision,
this
statute
passed
the
aid
of
the
war
power
can
now
be
translated
and
is
justified
on
the
basis
of
foreign
relations
power.
it
is
the
congress'
intention
in
passing
a
statute
that
i
would
say
would
be
determine
whether
or
not
the
exercise
of
power
is
proper.
congress
cannot
pass
a
statute
under
the
intended
to
aid
interstate
commerce
suggests
and
then
argue
--
then
have
it
argued
here
that
in
fact
it
was
intended
to
aid
foreign
relations,
so
i've
moved
too
close.
i
think
the
government
is
bound
in
considering
the
meaning
of
the
statute
by
the
intention
of
those
who
drafted
it.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
and
considering
i
haven't
address
myself
yet
to
the
power.
i
merely
addressed
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
argument
of
the
government,
that
foreign
relations
was
involved,
was
really
involved.
i
come
to
the
question
of
power
next.
i
have
not
addressed
myself
to
the
question
of
power,
but
the
question
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute
in
answer
to
the
government's
argument
that
the
statue
was
intended
somehow
rather
to
relate
to
foreign
relations.
i'm
suggesting
it
was
only
intended
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
first
would
say
that
could
not
be
done,
yes
your
honor.
now.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
--
that
that
was
not
be.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
say
that,
that
is
not
within
the
power
of
congress.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think
one
can
say
that
a
statute
that
was
passed
and
that
congress
says
was
passed
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
the
war
power,
can
now
be
justified
on
the
ground
that
it
might
conceivably
have
some
relationship
to
the
foreign
relations
power.
now
this
is
quite
aside
from
the
question
of
whether
congress
has
the
power
at
all
of
course.
in
short
i
think
that
when
one
comes
before
the
court
to
argue
that
a
statute
is
justified
on
the
one
power
or
another,
one
doesn't
pluck
from
the
wings
a
power
which
one
can
find
as
an
advocate
on
the
constitution.
it
has
to
have
some
relations
to
the
reality
and
if
in
fact
this
statute
didn't
have
any
relationship
to
the
reality
of
foreign
relations,
in
1865
or
1912,
the
government
can't
simply
find
the
foreign
relations
power
and
say
it
might
have
some
relationship
to
it.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
not
think
that
they
are
inseparable
and
i
don't
think
that
congress
felt
that
they
are
inseparable
in
considering
this.
there
is
not
a
line
in
any
of
the
legislative
history
from
1865
to
date
which
suggests
that
the
congress
was
concerned
about
foreign
relations
in
any
of
these
statutes.
however,
i
bear
in
mind
your
honor's
point.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no
i'm
addressing
myself
to
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
with
purpose.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
it
is
your
honor.
now
the
government,
i
will
simply
say
without
pressing
the
point
further
that
the
government
refers
to
various
problems
arising
on
the
war
of
1812
and
the
problems
for
the
north
german
states.
those
problems
were
quite
different
from
those
which
led
to
the
impact
of
1865
and
a
careful
reading
of
the
remarks
of
the
state
department
papers
will
show
those
problems
related
to
the
question
of
american
citizens
who
went
aboard
and
who
were
pressed
into
the
armies
of
the
north
german
states
in
the
1850's
and
1860's
or
in
1812
of
course
to
our
seamen
were
being
pressed.
they
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
question,
what
would
happen
when
people
who
were
--
our
draft
delinquents
went
aboard.
and
i
will
not
take
the
time
of
the
court
to
refer
the
court
who
i
think
has
been
misstated
by
commentators
like
saing
who
was
relied
upon
by
the
government,
where
they
attempt
to
prove
a
connection
between
these
problems
with
the
north
german
states
and
the
act
of
1865.
those
north
german
state
problems
were
all
dealt
with
in
the
act
of
1868,
the
expatriation
act
and
in
our
treaties
in
the
1870s
with
the
north
german
states,
but
they
have
no
connection,
except
that
they
happen
to
be
in
approximately
the
same
period
with
the
statute
with
which
we're
now
dealing.
now
the
government
suggests
that
some
how
or
other
the
possibility
that
there
is
flight
aboard
here
or
the
fact
there
is
flight
aboard
or
in
the
case
of
dr.
cort
it
wasn't
one
who
flight
aboard,
it
was
remaining
aboard,
distinguishes
this
case
from
trop.
i
have
only
to
refer
the
court
to
the
government's
brief
in
perez
against
brownell,
which
is
quoted
at
page
31
of
my
brief,
where
the
court
said,
in
talking
about
the
desertion
and
the
draft
evasion
sections,
“the
reasons
which
sustained,”
where
the
government
said
pardon
me,
“which
sustained
section
401(j)
also
apply
to
the
cognate
section
401(g).
desertion
in
war
time
like
draft
evasion
is
a
repudiation
of
the
highest
obligation
of
citizenship
and
involves
kindred
considerations.
subsection
(g)
does
different
from
subsection
(j)
in
that
it
will
meet
the
requirement
of
flight
from
this
country
or
foreign
residence,
but
the
absence
of
this
factor,
said
the
government,
does
is
not
swing
balance
against
constitutionality”
and
we
agree
of
course
with
that
position,
at
least
that
part,
not
the
earlier
part.
now
there
is
a
very
real
difference
i
may
suggest
between
this
case
and
perez.
it's
true
that
in
both
cases
and
in
numerous
other
cases
people
happen
geographically
to
have
been
aboard,
but
geography
is
not
the
essence
of
perez.
as
your
honors
will
recall
from
the
detailed
opinion
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
was
not
that
perez
was
in
a
foreign
country.
it
was
what
perez
did
in
that
foreign
country
that
the
majority
of
this
court
regarded
as
having
a
bearing
upon
foreign
relations.
and
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
although
very
respectfully
we
have
differed
from
it
on
our
brief
here,
is
very
precise,
that
perez
in
remaining
aboard
and
in
voting
aboard
was
actively
doing
something
which
was
an
interference
with
another
country's
internal
affairs,
although
i
think
he
had
a
right
to
as
a
dual
national,
and
that,
that
interference
might
be
attributed
to
the
united
states,
that
the
united
states
would
be
regarded
as
the
principal
and
perez
as
the
agent.
well,
nobody
would
suggest
in
these
cases
that
mendoza-martinez
was
the
agent
of
the
united
states
in
remaining
in
mexico
or
dr.
cort
in
remaining
aboard,
in
defiance
as
the
government
claims,
of
their
obligations
under
the
selective
service
act.
and
it
is
--
if
we
take
the
full
meaning
of
perez,
the
attribution
to
the
united
states
government
of
something,
which
might
lead
another
government
to
resent
it
then
of
course
this
case
is
clearly
distinguishable.
now
the
government's
theory
of
the
delinquency
of
obligations,
which
is
the
essence
of
its
sovereignty
point,
as
various
members
of
court
have
indicated
and
as
prior
counsel
have
indicated
is
a
very
dangerous
doctrine,
because
where
do
you
stop?
what
obligation
of
citizenship
is
it;
that
is
to
lead
to
the
taking
away
of
citizenship
status
itself.
why
do
we
have
a
system
of
punishments
instead
of
a
system
of
banishment
in
this
country?
and
i
remember
hearing
in
this
connection,
just
give
one
illustration,
one
of
our
finest
district
court
judge's
in
the
united
states
judge
edward
weinfeld,
talked
once
on
the
subject
of
sentencing.
judge
weinfeld
said
that
in
his
view,
a
man
who
was
most
delinquent
in
his
obligations
of
citizenship
above
all
others
was
a
man
who
has
defrauded
the
government
of
taxes,
because
taxation
was
the
sinuous
of
a
government
and
that
was
the
case
where
judge
weinfeld,
a
very
fair
but
very
able
judge
imposed
the
most
severe
penalties.
now
the
illustrations,
the
manifold,
there
is
not
much
point
in
my
trying
to
be
more
ingenious
than
other
counsel
and
the
various
members
of
the
court
in
illustrating
where
this
is,
where
this
ends,
but
i
think
it
ends
nowhere
and
it
comes
down
to
the
whole
problem
with
the
conception
of
citizenship.
i
would
suggest
that
we
of
course
adhere
to
the
basic
principles
laid
down
by
the
chief
justice
in
the
majority
--
in
the
first
section
of
his
majority
opinion
in
trop
and
in
his
dissent
in
perez,
but
we
have
not
found
it
necessary
in
view
of
the
time,
i
simply
won't
argue
what
is
not
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
on
the
question
of
the
general
power
of
the
government
in
a
case
where
there
is
“a
rational
nexus”,
to
take
away
citizenship,
but
the
broader
doctrine
that
somehow
or
other
there
exists
a
sovereign
power
in
the
government
to
take
away
from
the
people
who
intended
to
be
sovereign,
the
citizens,
their
status
this
i
think
is
an
appalling
doctrine,
and
the
government
has
attempted
to
minimize
here,
the
question
of
statelessness.
and
i
prefer
to
refer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
comments
in
one
of
the
cases,
i
think
it
was
in
trop
where
he
pointed
out
--
where
he
pointed
out
that
citizenship,
the
loss
of
citizenship
has
tragic
consequences.
while
the
justice
ameliorated
the
situation
to
some
degree,
no
reflection
of
these
tragic
consequences
is
suggested
in
the
government's
brief
and
i
would
merely
indicate
a
few
things
to
the
court
at
the
present
time.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
if
there
had
been
sufficient
time,
your
honor,
i
would
have
welcomed
the
opportunity
that
i
think
that
really
involved
a
re-argument
of
trop.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
re-argument
of
perez,
but
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
make
that
point
here
because
we
make
the
point
that
trop
is
controlling
in
the
sense
that
we
have
had
punishment
here.
punishment
here
which
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
the
eighth
amendment,
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
between
the
act
of
remaining
abroad
and
the
foreign
relations
power
of
the
united
states
and
that
therefore
under
both
perez
and
trop
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
i
do
make
the
argument.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no
i'm
not.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i'm
not
asking
your
honors
to
overrule
trop,
i'm
asking
your
honors
to
follow
trop.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yeah.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i'm
going
to
be
more
responsive
to
your
honor,
if
i
may.
i'm
asking,
your
honor
to
--
i'm
not
asking
your
honors
to
overrule
perez
because
perez
was
a
case
not
involving
in
the
view
of
the
court
punishment,
but
involving
a
rational
relationship
which
doesn't
exist
here.
and
i'm
not
asking,
your
honors
to
overrule
the
others,
if
your
honor
--
i'd
be
glad
to
say
why
i'm
not.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
am
precisely
urging
that
and
relying
upon
trop
as
my
authority.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
but
in
none
of
the
cases
in
which
the
court
reaffirmed
that
was
the
issue
of
punishment
involved.
in
each
case
the
court
regarded
that
and
i
think
that
point
has
been
made
in
all
of
the
opinions
of
the
court,
the
court
has
regarded
that
as
a
transfer
of
allegiance,
your
honor
is
referring
to
mackenzie
against
hare,
the
savorgnan.
those
were
cases
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
the
first
two
were
cases
clearly
of
a
transfer
of
allegiance.
i
think
that
perez
represents
the
first
break
with
the
past
and
given
the
time
i
would
welcome
the
opportunity
to
reargue
that
principle,
that
the
rational
nexus
theory
can
be
applied
to
citizenship
itself.
but
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
reargue
them.
the
important
point
is
that
i
am
not
faced
with
any
decision
of
this
court,
which
says
that
punishment
can
be
constitutionally
imposed
or
rather
that
denationalization
can
be
imposed
as
a
form
of
punishment
constitutionally.
i
have
on
my
side
the
one
case
which
is
in
my
favor
here,
which
is
your
honor's
own
decision
in
trop,
an
indistinguishable
statute
in
terms
of
origin,
language
from
the
beginning
and
the
general
developmental
history.
so
that
there
is
no
case
in
this
court,
no
case
as
yet,
unless
this
is
to
be
it
in
reversal
of
trop,
in
which
this
court
has
said
someone
maybe
punished,
maybe
punished
for
by
taking
away
his
citizenship.
now
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
believe
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
that.
i
do
not
know
the
facts.
i
could
not
conceive
that
it
--
i
would
--
cannot
conceive
of
it
being
at
all
relevant
here
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
believe
so
but
i
am
not
sure
your
honor.
i
would
have
to
address
myself
to
that.
if
dr.
cort
sought
admission
as
a
stateless
person,
if
he
did,
it
was
obviously
because
the
united
states
was
not
giving
him
at
that
time
and
as
it
had
not
from
1951
on,
a
passport.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
such
line
of
continuity
between
renunciation
of
american
citizenship
and
the
adoption
of
stateless.
one
never
adopts
a
stateless
position.
it's
a
limbo
into
which
one
is
thrown
by
his
government's
act
or
his
own,
but
he
doesn't
adopt
it.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly
your
honor,
and
in
perez
where
they
had
already
rejected
another
allegiance,
which
the
man
still
was
able
to
retain.
this
will
be
as
i
said,
perhaps
not
expertly,
originally
the
only
case
in
which
a
man
has
been
--
has
had
his
citizenship
taken
away,
that
i
know
of,
whether
for
a
crime
or
otherwise,
but
the
by
the
act
of
his
government
and
in
which
he
will
become
stateless.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
he
never
wanted
your
honor
to
be
stateless.
this
was
a
situation
enforced
upon
him
by
the
united
states
government.
and
dr.
cort
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
this
moment
does
not
have
the
full
privileges
of
an
american
citizen
to
which
he
his
entitled,
under
the
decision
of
the
court
below
because
in
answer
to
a
question
that
was
given
the
other
day,
dr.
cort
only
has
a
one-way
passport
to
the
united
states
given
by
the
united
states
government
in
response
to
the
order
of
the
court
below.
well
now
obviously
he
is
entitled
to
all
the
rights
of
a
citizen.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
have
emphatically
in
my
brief
your
honor
agreed
with
the
chief
justice's
opinions
to
which
i
have
referred
before
and
denied
here
as
i
have
elsewhere
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
had
the
power
to
take
away
against
a
man's
consent
his
citizenship,
but
i
have
said
that
as
--
that
i
do
not
have
to
carry
that
burden
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
am
certainly
not
waiving
it,
i
have
made
the
point
in
my
brief
and
nothing
would
please
me
more
than
to
have
the
court
as
i
think
it
should
pass
upon
the
issue,
but
i
do
not
think
that
in
my
case
it
will
have
to.
i
would
have
welcomed
the
opportunity
for
a
full
argument
before
the
court
to
reargue
this
particular
matter,
because
i
consider
it
one
of
the
most
serious
decisions
that
was
ever
made
by
the
court
and
leave
this
[inaudible]
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
even
if
counsel
doesn't
raise
it
and
i
have
raised
it
from
the
first
day
that
we
began
this
case,
i
have
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
any
congressional
action
whatsoever
in
depriving
a
man
of
american
citizenship.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
have
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
have
a
slightly
[inaudible]
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
have
--
well
i
hope
that
the
trop
will
not
the
overruled
your
honors
since
i
think
that
it
is
very
substantial
authority
for
me
here.
may
i
make
two
more
observations
in
view
of
the
time
problem?
the
first
is
that
the
discussion
by
the
government
of
the
fact
that
there
are
conventions
being
held
for
the
purpose
of
minimizing
or
continually
mitigating
the
rigors
of
the
absence
of
nationality
is
the
best
proof
that
there
are
very
critical
problems
involved
in
terms
of
the
loss
of
nationality
and
one
doesn't
need
be
sociological
expert
to
tell
of
refuge
problems
that
exists
all
over
the
world
today,
because
the
people
without
nationality
even
where
political
problems
are
not
involved.
and
of
course
if
dr.
cort
were
to
come
to
this
country
and
would
find
that
by
a
decision
of
this
court,
the
novel
one
that
i
suggested
before,
he
no
longer
had
citizenship.
your
honors
realize
that
he
would
fall
under
241(a)
of
the
act
making
him
an
excludable
person.
he
would
fall
under
212
(a)
of
the
act,
he
would
fall
under
241
of
the
act
making
him
a
deportable
alien.
he
would
fall
under
another
section
of
the
act,
which
gives
the
attorney
general
the
right
to
arrest
him,
a
man
born
in
this
country,
keep
him
for
six
months
or
so,
look
for
another
country
to
deport
him
and
he
would
fall
under
probably
the
most
serious
section
of
the
act
in
the
history
of
this
country
that
lower
courts
at
least
have
criticized,
the
provision
that
he
shall
be
subject
to
supervision
under
regulations
prescribed
by
the
attorney
general,
that
he
shall
submit
to
medical
and
psychiatric
examinations.
this
is
an
american
citizen,
a
man
born
in
this
country,
that
he
shall
give
information
under
oath
as
to
his
nationality,
circumstances,
habits,
associations
and
activities
and
such
other
information
whether
or
not
related
to
the
foregoing
as
the
attorney
general
may
seem
--
feel
fit
and
proper,
this
is
what
happens.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
concession
i
very
much
appreciate
your
honor,
but
i
regret
that
my
good
friend
learned
as
he
is,
cannot
speak
for
the
congress
of
the
united
states
or
even
for
those
who
administer
the
statue.
just
as
statelessness
says,
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
is
a
wide
area
of
unknown
dangers,
so
entering
the
statute
under
--
entering
the
country
under
these
unusual
circumstances,
if
we
were
not
to
prevail,
it
would
create
very
serious
problems.
of
course
i
have
been
talking
about
the
dr.
cort
individually,
let
us
forget
about
dr.
cort
and
consider
x,
because
this
court
is
concerned
with
the
border
problem.
a
man
norn
in
this
country
not
entering
under
these
particular
circumstances,
is
he
to
be
treated,
the
american
citizen
born
here,
treated
this
dreadful
way
that
we
subject
aliens
even
in
1962
and
i
had
a
sad
smile
as
i
heard
some
other
statements
made
about
the
amelioration
of
our
immigration
laws,
but
every
member
of
this
court
knows
what
our
immigrations
law
are
today.
and
i
would
only
add
one
word
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice
with
respect
to
a
problem
that
i
passed
over
a
little
too
quickly.
i
think
i
may
not
have
been
completely
fair
to
counsel
or
to
the
court
when
i
moved
into
an
argument
on
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
doctrine,
because
if
in
fact
the
government's
admission
is
a
justifiable
one
and
i
think
it
is,
namely
as
mr.
terris,
preceding
counsel
stated.
if
this
is
punishment
said
mr.
terris,
then
the
statute
is
embowered
as
the
court
because
he
never
had
a
trial,
a
point
made
by
mr.
justice
black,
which
i
discussed
the
other
day.
there
has
--
there
is
no
trial
provided
for
under
this
desertion
--
under
this
draft
evasion
statute.
although
there
is
a
trial
provided
for
under
the
desertion
statute
and
the
fact
that
we
may
ultimately
review
the
proceedings
in
a
360
action
or
in
some
other
action
of
the
judicial
code
does
not
mean
that
we
have
had
a
trial,
which
has
led
to
the
punishment.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
your
honor
and
i
would
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
your
honor
yes
and
i
would
say
we
have
not
even
had
a
civil
trial
of
the
kind
which
we
were
entitled
to
before
we
lose
our
nationality.
we
lost,
well
dr.
cort,
i
don't
want
to
make
this
too
inclusive
at
the
moment,
dr.
cort
lost
his
nationality
as
a
result
of
an
administrative
decision
of
an
assistant
division
head
in
the
department
of
state.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
your
honor
the
ground
on
which
his
passport
was
denied
occurred
in
1951.
the
government
is
taking
some
support
for
that
here,
in
violation
--
under
the
general
principles,
which
were
struck
down
by
this
court
in
kent
and
grale
against
dulles.
the
government
from
51
on
was
treating
dr.
cort
as
if
he
were
not
entitled
to
some
of
the
benefits
of
citizenship,
they
denied
him
a
passport.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct.
the
position
of
the
government
is
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
may
i
respond?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
the
position
of
the
government
is
and
it
was
the
position
taken
by
the
department
of
state
that
from
the
moment
that
he
allegedly
remained
aboard
to
avoid
the
draft,
from
that
moment,
without
a
trial
judicial
administrative,
criminal
or
civil,
he
lost
his
citizenship.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
the
statute
doesn't
provide
for
any
trial.
it
provided
the
act
of
remaining
aboard,
now
when
the
time
comes
to
be
denied
a
benefit
like
a
passport
as
occurred
later
in
1959.
an
administrative
chief
in
the
department
of
state
says,
“i
have
looked
over
the
papers,
i
am
satisfied
that
dr.
cort
remained
aboard
for
avoiding
the
draft,
purpose
of
avoiding
the
draft
and
i
therefore
hold
that
he
is
not
a
citizen.”
then
you
go
to
the
board
of
the
nationality
review,
which
again
under
the
procedure
i
have
indicated
makes
the
same,
but
none
of
this
is
provided
for
by
--
no
trial
is
provided
for
by
statute.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
the
only
judicial
review
we
could
have
here
would
be
one
of
the
constitutionality
of
statute
and
as
mr.
justice
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
ah
but
the
question,
the
original
question
is,
was
there
a
jurisdiction
to
deny
dr.
cort
in
the
first
place
a
passport?
was
there
a
power
in
the
government
without
a
hearing,
without
the
trial
which
this
court
suggested
in
the
kurtz
case,
which
the
court
of
--
which
the
pennsylvania
court
of
appeals
suggested
in
huber,
was
a
condition
preceding
to
the
depravation
of
a
right,
but
because
between
the
time
that
dr.
cort
allegedly
remained
away
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
draft,
and
the
time
that
the
court
ultimately
decided
the
matter,
he
was
denied
rights
by
the
department
of
state
without
a
trial,
on
the
ground
that
they
had
evaluated
the
situation
and
that
he
was
no
longer
an
american
citizen.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think
the
supreme
court
is
a
court
of
original
jurisdiction
your
honor
to
hear
this
kind
of
matter.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
quite
a
difficult
trial,
because
the
state's
normally
on
affidavits
this
were
--
this
was
and
is
not
the
trial
which
congress,
which
the
constitution
contemplates
as
a
trial
occurring
before
the
man
is
to
be
deprived
of
benefits.
as
your
honors
will
recall
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
as
a
final
word
if
i
may
impose
your
honor,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i've
tried
to
reach
this
point
before,
in
a
footnote
to
trop
suggested,
this
is
footnote
number
three,
suggested
that
trop,
or
a
person
like
trop
could
have
shown
in
his
judicial
trial
that
the
court-martial
was
without
jurisdiction
and
we
suggest
that
the
judicial
trial
here,
the
so
called
judicial
trial
before
the
three-judge
court
in
which
we
saw
a
passport,
it
is
appropriate
to
show
not
merely
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
a
court-martial
which
wasn't
here,
but
there
was
no
trial
at
all.
i
thank
your
honor
for
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
your
honor
there
is
a
presumption
that
i
have
dealt
with
in
my
brief.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly
and
we
have
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
that
presumption.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
think
that
it
bears
no
rational
relationship
to
the
fact
involved
particularly
because
it
says
that
any
violation
of
the
selective
service
laws
will
lead
to
a
presumption
that
a
man
is
remaining
abroad
for
the
purposes
of
avoiding
the
draft.
well
your
honors
who
are
at
least
as
expert
as
i
am
in
this
area
know
the
numerous
violations
of
the
selective
service
laws,
all
of
which
are
necessarily
as
a
matter
of
law
encompassed
within
this
word
any
violation.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
missed
your
honor's
point
--
your
honor
is
quite
right.
that
is
quite
true,
we
have
that
additional
burden
and
we
address
ourselves
on
the
constitutional
level
really
to
that
as
well
as
the
preceding
point.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
shall
answer
your
honor.
this
matter
is
still
in
litigation.
dr.
cort
has
been
given
only
a
small
part
of
its
right
to
the
citizen
by
the
united
states
government,
namely
a
one-way
passport.
there
is
no
indication
that
the
government,
although
we
prevailed
in
the
court
below,
is
prepared
to
recognize
him
as
a
full
citizen
with
a
very
ill
wife,
as
the
record
will
indicate,
bring
his
family
here
and
to
begin
to
try
to
settle
down
while
this
matter
is
in
litigation,
would
be
i
think
an
unreasonable
burden
on
any
individual.
i
may
say
in
answer
to
your
honor's
unspoken
question
and
mr.
doolittle's
stated
point
that
dr.
cort
does
not
want
czechoslovakian
citizenship.
we
thank
the
government
for
suggesting
that
he
might
be
eligible
for
it,
but
it
is
the
one
thing
that
we
have
not
wanted
and
the
one
thing
that
dr.
cort
does
want
is
to
have
american
citizenship,
to
have
all
the
rights
and
to
comeback
here
as
an
american
citizen
either
to
go
into
the
army,
and
your
honor's
will
read
the
record
to
show
the
efforts
that
we
made
beginning
with
1959
in
our
meetings
with
general
hershey
on
this
moment
or/and
to
face
a
criminal
indictment,
but
to
give
us
a
crumb
here
with
all
the
sanctions
that
might
be
imposed
when
the
government
is
ready
to
colloquially
if
i
may
say,
lift
the
beam,
i'm
afraid
that
they
dropped
the
beam,
i'm
afraid
that,
that
will
be
an
unfair
burden
at
the
moment.
but
dr.
cort
has
done
nothing,
although
he
could
have
of
course
in
the
way
of
adopting
czechoslovakian
citizenship
and
his
children
as
indicated
here
are
american
citizens.
now
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
i
am.
i
think
the
punishment
aspect
aids
it.
the
government
suggests
i'm
dependent
upon
on
whether
it
is
punishment,
but
i
make
it
regardless
whether
it
is
punishment
because
whether
you
call
it
punishment
the
government
uses
the
word
technically
or
not.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
well
i
didn't
know
the
statute,
it's
for
congress
to
pass
a
statute
that
will
give
us
a
trial,
until
they
do
that
i
think
one
can
assume,
at
least
we
assume
that
the
depravation
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
government
was
never
faced
with
the
argument
that
i
have
made
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
the
court
in
both
cases
decided
in
favor
of
the
individuals
involved.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
on
that
basis
without
ever
holding
because
the
issue
was
never
litigated
as
i
can
recall
it,
without
ever
holding
that
the
depravation
could
occur
without
a
trial.
this
issue
that
i
have
posed
in
our
briefs
and
we
raised
in
the
district
court,
that
there
must
be
a
trial
similar
to
the
one
which
existed
in
trop.
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
exactly,
it
would
have
to
be
a
trial
and
congress
has
setup
as
the
court
has
held,
congress
has
setup
a
court
martial
procedure
for
the
deserter.
it
has
never
set
up
any
kind
of
trial
for
the
man
who
is
allegedly
remaining
abroad
for
avoiding
the
draft.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
your
honor
and
this
court
has
not
held,
has
not
held
that
the
issue
has
never
been
raised,
that
a
person
can
even
in
the
absence
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
be
deprived
of
his
nationality
by
virtue
of
an
act
whose
interpretation
is
left
in
the
hands
of
an
administrative
official.
that
was
not
raised
in
nishikawa;
that
was
not
raised
in
gonzales;
that
has
never
been
raised
before.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
recall
the
precise
trial
--
there
was
no
trial
as
--
there
was
no
trial
here
until
many,
many
months
and
years
after
we
had
suffered
the
depravation
of
citizenship
in
the
view
of
the
state
department.
there
was
no
trial
until
many
months
after
an
administrative
official
of
the
state
department
had
said
you
have
lost
your
citizenship
as
of
september
1953.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
never
had
a
trial
here.
we
had
a
review
proceeding
of
the
district
court
on
which
we
charged
that
the
absence
of
a
trial
made
the
government's
action
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
and
not
a
decision
reached
by
a
man
across
the
desk,
a
perfectly
nice
man
in
the
state
department
who
shuffled
some
papers
and
has
a
pleasant
oral
argument
with
me.
and
then
as
result
of
the
shuffling
of
papers,
which
i
have
never
seen,
makes
a
decision
which
led
to
the
telegram,
which
is
set
forth
in
the
record
here.
citizenship,
the
passport
denied,
because
you've
expatriated
yourself.
that
man
maybe
the
finest
man
in
the
world,
but
the
constitution
didn't
set
him
up
to
try
people
and
to
deprive
them
of
citizenship.
thank
you.
i
thank
you
your
honor.
