mr.
milton
kramer
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
having
declined
to
review
it.
the
facts
are
these.
in
the
midst
of
a
local
political
campaign,
the
judge
of
the
superior
court
of
bibb
county,
on
behalf
of
all
three
judges
of
that
court,
delivered
a
special
charge
to
a
grand
jury.
before
delivering
that
special
charge,
the
local
press
had
been
notified
to
have
reporters
present.
they
did
have
reporters
present.
in
that
charge,
the
judge,
after
advising
the
grand
jury,
he
was
speaking
on
behalf
of
all
three
judges,
said
among
other
things,
“we
find
what
appears
to
be
an
inane
and
inexplicable
pattern
of
negro
bloc
voting.”
mr.
milton
kramer
beginning
on
page
6
of
the
record.
the
part
i
just
read
is
the
last
part
of
the
paragraph
ending
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page.
he
then
continued,
and
i'm
skipping
some
unimportant
phrases
and
clauses,
“there
is
an
answer
which
should
be
brought
to
life
so
that
people
of
the
community
may
understand
what
is
going
on.
the
people
are
entitled
to
know
how
one
candidate
or
another
is
able
to
gather
to
himself
thousands
of
negro
votes
in
bloc
where
there
is
no
apparent
reason
for
it.”
then,
over
in
the
next
page
--
mr.
milton
kramer
it's
macon.
mr.
milton
kramer
macon
is
the
big
city
in
central
georgia.
mr.
milton
kramer
at
the
top
of
the
page,
he
advised
the
grand
jury
“bloc
voting
is
apparent.”
then,
the
last
sentence
of
that
paragraph
ending
on
that
page,
“we
do
not
mean
to
say
to
you
that
negros
do
not
have
the
vote
--
the
right
to
bloc
vote,
if
they
wish
to
do
so
if
their
self-interest
is
a
factor
in
their
decision,”
presumably,
otherwise,
they
have
no
such
right
in
the
view
of
the
judge.
the
next
paragraph,
“issues,
principles,
or
policies
may
under
some
circumstances,
justify
certain
groups
in
casting
similar
votes,
but
if
the
vote
is
a
right,
it
is
an
individual
right
and
carries
with
it
the
duty
and
obligation
of
intelligent
determination
by
the
individual
claiming
the
right.
there
is
no
right
of
a
vote
to
be
bartered,
nor
is
there
any
right
to
a
vote
to
be
cast
in
bloc.”
now,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
“there
is
no
doubt
that
when
the
vast
majority
blindly
follow
the
leaders
and
vote
as
they
are
told,
it
actually
amounts
to
a
purchase
of
thousands
of
votes
by
the
favorite
candidate.”
now,
over
on
page
10,
after
instructing
the
grand
jury
on
the
existence
of
certain
election
laws
which
had
not
been
enforced
for
over
50
years,
they
had
a
law
on
the
books
at
that
time
which
made
it
illegal
to
pay
anybody
to
campaign
for
you.
all
campaigning
had
to
be
by
volunteer,
but
that
had
been
ignored
for
50
years
and
he
refers
to
that
on
page
10,
the
first
paragraph
starting
that
page,
“some
may
say
that
the
hiring
of
people
for
the
purpose
of
canvassing
and
influencing
voters
to
vote
for
one
candidate
rather
than
another
is
a
common
practice
in
elections
and,
therefore,
should
be
overlooked,”
but
he
tells
them
not
to
overlook
it
in
the
case
of
negro
bloc
voting.
on
page
11,
in
the
third
paragraph,
“it
is
not
unusual
to
hear
a
candidate
proclaim
that
there
are
no
racial
issues
involved
and
that
he
represents
no
special
interest.
that
he
is
beholden
to
no
particular
individual
or
group
and
yet
we
find
on
election
day
getting
an
almost
solid
negro
bloc
vote
and
no
satisfactory
explanation
is
ever
offered.”
that
was
on
june
the
6th.
after
he
delivered
his
charge,
copies
of
his
charge
were
available
for
distribution
in
the
judge's
chambers.
the
next
day,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
who
also
was
the
sheriff
of
the
county,
issued
a
news
release,
and
that
appears
on
page
12.
in
that,
he
said
among
the
following,
and
this
was
the
basis
for
his
first
citation
--
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
but
there
is
some
--
mr.
milton
kramer
there
was
no
implication
about
that
but,
later,
there
was
a
stipulation
of
facts
that
at
the
time
he
made
this
statement,
the
grand
jury
had
in
its
possession
the
records
of
some
earlier
elections
in
which
he
had
been
a
candidate
but
there
was
no
implication
that
they
were
aimed
at
him,
except
that
he
had
--
the
fact
is
he
had
gotten
large
support
from,
at
least
i
think
he
had,
from
the
negro
vote.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
presumably.
there's
no
evidence
of
the
fact.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
think
you
can
infer
nothing
from
the
prompt
reaction.
this
man
had
been
active
in
politics
and
it
doesn't
show
in
the
record
but
he
had
not
been
in
the
judge's
camp.
mr.
milton
kramer
he's
in
elective
office
and
so
was
the
judge.
mr.
milton
kramer
four
years,
i
think,
and
the
sheriff
also.
this
is
the
superior
court
of
bibb
county.
each
county
has
at
least
one
judge.
this
particular
one
has
three.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
it's
not
(inaudible)
court.
the
petitioner
then
issued
his
news
release,
which
appears
on
--
beginning
on
page
12.
in
it,
he
said
“the
people
of
bibb
--
he
distributed
this
to
reporters
“the
people
of
bibb
county
should
take
notice
when
their
highest
judicial
officers
threaten
political
persecution
carried
out
under
the
guise
of
law
enforcement.”
whatever
the
judge's
intention,
the
action
of
the
superior
court
judges
ordering
a
bibb
county
grand
jury
to
investigate
negro
bloc
voting
“will
be
considered
one
of
the
most
deplorable
examples
of
race
agitation
to
come
out
of
the
middle
georgia
in
recent
years,”
and
skipping
down
to
the
paragraph
after
the
next,
“no
one
would
question
the
duty
of
a
grand
jury
to
investigate
any
at
all
election
law
violations.
however,
simple
justice
would
demand
that
the
judge
not
single
out
the
negro
people
for
particular
investigation.
if
we
seriously
wish
to
enforce
the
old
law
against
hiring
workers
for
canvassing
or
influencing
voters,
then
let
us
start
by
indicting
our
u.s.
senators,
congressmen,
and
governors,
and
almost
all
elected
state
officials.
if
we
overlook
the
mountain
of
white
candidates
and
campaign
workers
who
have
violated
this
old
law
to
investigate
the
mole
hill
of
a
few
negro
campaign
workers,
then
truly
we
are
manipulating
the
law
in
a
manner
to
persecute
the
few.
this
is
the
type
of
political
legal
action
which
brings
down
ridicule
and
demands
for
civil
right
legislation
against
the
south.
then,
he
got
a
little
stronger.
“negro
people
will
find
little
difference
in
principle
between
attempted
intimidation
of
their
people
by
judicial
summons
and
inquiry
and
attempted
intimidation
by
physical
demonstration
such
as
used
by
the
kkk.”
mr.
milton
kramer
yes?
mr.
milton
kramer
he
is
a
member
of
the
bar,
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
and
he's
--
he
has
not
been
suspended
from
practice.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
he
is
practicing
law
today.
this
conviction
does
not
deprive
him
of
the
right
to
continue
to
practice.
“it
is
hoped
that
the
present
grand
jury
will
not
let
its
high
office
be
a
party
to
any
political
attempt
to
intimidate
the
negro
people
in
this
community.”
then,
down
at
the
end,
“it
further
seems
a
height
of
hypocrisy
to
dust
off
an
old
blue
law
that
has
been
ignored
for
50
years
and
suddenly
order
its
rigid
enforcement
against
the
minority
group
of
voters.
however,
politically
popular
the
judge's
action
may
be
at
this
time,
they
are
employing
a
practice
far
more
dangerous
to
free
elections
than
anything
they
want
investigated.”
mr.
milton
kramer
i
don't
know.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
just
don't
know.
on
july
7,
a
month
later,
the
solicitor
general
of
the
county
filed
a
petition
for
contempt.
a
contempt
citation
was
issued
the
same
day.
the
following
day,
the
petitioner
did
two
things.
he
wrote
a
letter
and
issued
another
press
release.
i
will
overlook
the
letter
now
and
come
back
to
it
later.
the
letter
formed
--
later
formed
the
grounds
for
count
2
of
the
contempt
citation.
i'll
skip
that
for
the
time
being
and
go
to
the
second
news
release.
in
his
second
news
release,
he
said
simply,
in
substance
and
nothing
else,
“my
defense
will
be
that
i
told
the
truth.”
mr.
milton
kramer
19
and
that's
the
very
first
line
of
his
second
press
release.
“my
defense
will
be
simply
that
i
have
spoken
the
truth”
and
then,
he
goes
on
to
elaborate,
“when
i
said
so
and
so,
wasn't
--
was
i
not
telling
the
truth,
and
when
i
said
so
and
so,
wasn't
i
telling
the
truth”
and
so
on.
the
petition
for
contempt
was
thereupon
amended
to
add
two
new
counts
of
contempt.
one
with
respect
to
the
letter,
which
i'll
discuss
later
and
the
third,
count
3,
that
this
statement
that
he
told
the
truth
the
first
time
was
an
independent
ground
of
contempt.
the
petitioner
demurred
--
he
filed
lots
of
demurrers
apparently
in
georgia,
75
demurrers.
mr.
milton
kramer
which
amendment,
the
latest
am
--
the
last
amendment?
mr.
milton
kramer
oh
so
add
the
counts,
14
of
the
record.
it
begins
on
14
of
the
record
and
they
add
count
2
and
3.
the
day
that
the
two
new
counts
were
filed,
the
judge
cited
him
for
the
additional
contempt
and
then,
in
view
of
the
demurrer
that
had
been
filed,
the
petition
for
contempt
was
further
amended
to
add
an
allegation
that
these
things
in
and
of
themselves
constituted
contempt
of
court.
they
added
an
allegation
to
that
effect.
they
did
not
add
an
allegation
to
the
effect
that
the
statements
were
untrue,
although
some
of
the
demurrers
were
based
on
the
absence
of
an
allegation
that
anything
he
said
was
untrue.
they
did
not
amend
it
to
allege
that
they
were
untrue.
all
the
demurrers
were
overruled.
now,
in
georgia
practice,
one
files
not
only
demurrers
but
at
the
same
time,
a
response
or
an
answer
in
an
ordinary
civil
suit.
the
plaintiff
filed
a
response
in
which
he
denied
the
allegation
that
his
actions
were
part
of
a
course
of
conduct
designed
to
be
contemptuous
and
--
of
the
court
and
to
ridicule
it
and
to
investigate
and
to
interfere
with
the
grand
jury
that
had
been
alleged
and
he
denied
it.
he
alleged
that
the
judge's
charge
was
given
in
the
midst
of
a
political
campaign
and
he
alleged
affirmatively
that
the
reason
he
gave
the
--
made
this
statement
was
that
he
wanted
the
people
of
the
county
to
know
what
he
verily
and
sincerely
believed.
at
the
hearing,
there
was
no
oral
testimony,
none
at
all.
the
only
facts
before
the
court
appear
by
reason
of
two
stipulations.
one
of
the
stipulations
on
page
45
simply
state,
first,
that
he
is
the
sheriff
of
the
county
and
on
the
county's
payroll.
second,
that
he
released
the
two
news
releases
to
the
press
and
that,
at
the
time
he
did
it,
the
grand
jury
had
before
it
the
records
of
some
earlier
elections
in
which
he
had
been
a
candidate.
thirdly,
that
the
judges
had
read
the
story
and,
fourth,
that
the
grand
jurors
had
been
disturbed.
those
were
the
only
facts
before
the
court
except,
by
reason
of
the
stipulation
which
appears
on
page
47,
to
the
effect
that
his
statements
--
the
petitioner's
statements
in
his
sworn
response
would
be
accepted
as
evidence.
that
was
the
stipulation
approved
by
the
court.
so
--
mr.
milton
kramer
the
stipulation
is
on
page
47.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
i
think
they
are
prescribed
by
statute
and
they
may
appear
in
the
appendix
to
the
--
the
statute
may
appear
in
an
appendix
to
the
respondent's
brief.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
does,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
one
doesn't
know
because
the
judge
who
found
him
in
contempt
simply
said
“i
have
considered
the
record
and
heard
arguments
of
counsel
and
i
find
you
guilty
on
all
three
counts.”
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
no.
the
sup
--
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
did
say
that
the
demurrer,
asking
that
the
allegation
that
he
was
sheriff
be
stricken
was
properly
overruled,
that's
all.
mr.
milton
kramer
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
it
could've
been
the
same
had
he
been
a
plain
citizen
because
the
court
made
no
findings
and
gave
no
reasons
for
his
conclusion.
he
simply
says
“i
consider
the
thing
and
i
find
you
guilty.”
and,
in
the
petitioner's
response,
he
affirmatively
stated,
well
this
may
be
a
conclusion
but
anyway
he
affirmatively
stated
that
he
was
not
acting
as
sheriff
at
the
time.
he
was
simply
acting
as
a
private
citizen
who's
interested
in
political
matters,
and
that
was
not
controverted.
mr.
milton
kramer
it
says
he
was
the
sheriff,
yes,
but
they
--
and
that
is
admitted.
he
was
the
sheriff
at
the
time
but
he
responded
by
saying
that
he
was
not
acting
as
a
sheriff.
he
was
simply
acting
as
a
private
citizen
and,
as
i
said,
that
was
not
controverted.
these
are
all
the
facts
that
the
court
had
before
it
and
incidentally,
although
no
point
was
made
of
this
in
the
court
below,
the
judge
who
tried
him
of
course
it
was
one
of
the
three
judges
who
had
prepared
this
special
charge
for
the
grand
jury.
mr.
milton
kramer
primary
campaign.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
next
month,
july
something,
i
don't
recall.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
charge
was
in
june.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
contempt
was
--
mr.
milton
kramer
july
7
and
whether
that
was
before
or
after,
i
don't
know.
i
think
the
election
was
at
12,
but
i'm--
mr.
milton
kramer
they
--
oh
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
the
record
doesn't
show.
my
information
is
that
they
run
every
four
years
and
that's
all
and
that
all
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
am
reasonably
sure
they
were.
the
record
doesn't
show,
but
i'm
reasonably
sure
that
all
of
them
run
every
four
years.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
it
might
be.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
it
would
certainly
change
the
facts
very
materially
because
it
would
not
be
singly
--
well,
this
news
release
would
never
have
been
made
because
it
was
singling
out
a
minority
group
when
everybody
was
doing
it
and
was
singling
out
the
minority
and
saying
“told
the
grand
jury
investigate
the
bloc
voting
of
this
small
minority,”
well
not
so
small
but
of
this
minority
group
when
everybody
was
doing
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
that
the
judge
was
trying
to
inject
a
racial
issue
into
the
campaign
and
the
petitioner
was
of
the
view
that
the
judge
was
trying
to
intimidate
the
negroes
against
voting
as
they
had
theretofore
voted
because
if
they
continue
to
vote
that
way
then
some
of
them
might
get
indicted.
that
was
the
petitioner's
sincere
belief
that
the
judge
was
trying
to
intimidate
them.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
and
all
these
done
by
--
mr.
milton
kramer
page
34?
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
whether
that
--
mr.
milton
kramer
they
seem
to
say
that
that
--
that
seems
to
mean
that
it's
a
little
worse
if
the
sheriff
does
it,
but
he
would
--
it
does
not
say
he
was
acting
as
sheriff,
but
because
he
was
a
sheriff.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
there
is
a
statute
which
provides
for
holding
the
sheriff
in
contempt
under
certain
circumstances.
well,
here
we
are
on
pages
36
and
37
of
the
respondent's
brief,
this
is
the
respondent's
brief.
it
gives
the
duties
of
the
sheriff
and
then
holds
that
the
court
then
provides,
in
the
next
section
on
page
37,
that
if
the
sheriff
fails
to
perform
his
official
duties,
the
court
may
hold
him
in
contempt.
now,
i
think,
impliedly,
that
means
not
otherwise
except
for
contempt
in
open
court,
i
suppose.
mr.
milton
kramer
this
is
the
respondent's
brief,
not
mine,
the
other
side.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
he
waits
on
the
court.
in
this
particular
county,
the
sheriff,
himself,
does
not
attend
the
grand
jury,
some
bailiffs
do.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
i
know.
i
think
not.
i
don't
know.
i
can
find
out.
mr.
milton
kramer
he
furthers
his
bailiff.
he
doesn't
do
it
himself.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
well,
i
think
that
was
simply
an
appellation
rather
than
describing
his
official
capacity.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
the
--
i
was
going
to
come
to
count
2.
they
reversed
count
2
and,
in
my
view,
i
think
count
2,
if
he
did
anything
apprehensible,
was
the
most
apprehensible,
but
they
reversed
his
conviction
on
that
one
and
the
respondent
makes
much
of
it.
he
kept
referring
it
to
count
2
in
their
brief,
although
they
did
not
appeal
from
the
reversal
or
seek
review
of
the
reversal
of
the
conviction
on
count
2.
that
was
the
letter
he
wrote
also
on
july
8
--
mr.
milton
kramer
i
think
that
might
be
a
cause
for
dismissing
him
but
i
don't
think
it
will
be
contempt.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
don't
know
that
you
can't
dismiss
him.
i
think
the
sheriff
can
be
impeached.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
well,
i
doubt
that
the
judge
would
hold
-
mr.
milton
kramer
--
will
conduct
the
impeachment
proceedings.
count
2
was
a
letter,
an
open
letter
to
the
grand
jury
which
he
gave
to
the
bailiff
to
deliver
to
the
grand
jury,
and
it
was
so
delivered
and
read,
in
which
he
said
in
substance
that
“if
you're
going
to
investigate
bloc
voting
by
the
negroes,
investigate
bloc
voting
by
the
groups
controlled
by
the
democratic
executive
committee
of
this
county.
they
have
bloc
voting,
too
and
why
don't
you
investigate
what
they're
doing?”
now
--
mr.
milton
kramer
in
effect,
a
deputy.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
but
the
--
he
was
convicted
for
contempt
on
that
count
and
that
conviction
was
reversed
and
the
repeated
discussions
about
it
in
the
respondent's
brief,
i
submit,
are
improper
because
that's
not
in
this
case
anymore.
it's
dead.
they
sought
no
review.
they're
not
seeking
review.
the
only
contempt
citations
that
are
before
this
court
are
in
counts
1
and
3.
the
petitioner
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia.
that
court
held
in
substance
that
conduct
that
has
a
tendency
to
obstruct
a
grand
jury
is
contempt.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes?
mr.
milton
kramer
i
think
not.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
said
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
still
not
be
contempt.
mr.
milton
kramer
what
i
said
was
i
think
it
will
not
--
still
would
not
be
contempt
because
the
statute
provides
--
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
absolutely
not.
now,
for
example,
they
have
an
allegation
also
that
he
was
on
the
public
payroll
and
he
asked
that
that
be
stricken
as
irrelevant
and
that
--
mr.
milton
kramer
an
a
fortiori
is
what's
contempt
here.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
i
mean,
they
are
not
equivalent.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
court
of
appeals
held
on
review,
a
conduct
that
has
a
tendency
to
obstruct
the
grand
jury
is
contempt.
it
held
also
that
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
statements
were
irrelevant,
that
even
if
true,
it
was
contempt.
it
held,
thirdly,
that
attacks
on
a
judge
which
could
have
had
the
effect
of
diverting
the
grand
jury
is
contempt.
it
held
that
the
allegation
that
the
petitioner
was
on
the
public
payroll
was
not
an
irrelevant
allegation,
just
on
the
public
payroll,
not
the
sheriff
and
then,
i
would
like
to
read
some
from
what
he
said,
beginning
on
page
63
of
the
record.
now,
i
must
apologize
to
the
court
for
the
fact
that
in
our
brief,
some
of
this
is
quoted
--
indicated
that
it
came
from
the
court
itself
while
what
the
court
was
doing
was
quoting
from
an
earlier
decision
but
the
effect
is
the
same.
they
were
quoting
and,
apparently,
with
approval,
saying
things
that
sound
to
me
like
the
old
discarded
scandalizing
the
court.
and,
at
one
time,
scandalizing
the
court
was
the
doctrine
in
georgia.
beginning
on
page
63,
it
says
“if
there
is
any
one
thing
in
democratic
society
which
must
be
presumed
conclusively
until
judicial
determination
to
the
contrary
by
a
court
of
law
or
impeachment,
it
is
the
integrity
of
the
courts,”
then
skipping
down
to
the
middle
of
the
paragraph,
“when
a
judge
is
accused
of
wrongdoing,
it
is
an
attack
and
an
undermining
of
one
of
the
most
important
supports
of
the
government.
if
a
judge
is
corrupt
or
incompetent,
there
may
be
a
remedy
by
suit,
prosecution,
impeachment,
or
at
the
polls.
now,
how
do
you
go
about
defeating
somebody
at
the
polls
or
impeaching
him
without
criticizing
his
--
without
criticizing
him?
it's
difficult
to
understand.
skipping
down
to
the
bottom
of
page
64,
this
is
again
quoting
from
one
of
their
prior
decisions,
“the
power
of
the
judiciary
rests
upon
the
faith
of
the
people
in
its
integrity
and
intelligence.
take
away
this
faith
and
the
moral
influence
of
the
courts
is
gone
and
respect
for
the
law
is
destroyed,
indicating
that
that's
their
starting
point.”
that's
what
--
that's
their
--
the
premise
from
which
they
reason
whether
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner
constituted
contempt.
mr.
milton
kramer
accusing
the
court
of
delivering
a
special
charge
for
political
purposes
and
directing
it
to
a
minority
group
without
being
--
without
direct
--
without
directing
a
criminal
investigation
or
alike
and
trying
to
intimidate
a
minority
group
from
voting
as
they
had
theretofore
voted.
and,
they
know
exactly
how
they
vote
because
they
have
segregated
voting
in
bibb
county.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
well,
imputing
to
the
court
an
attempt
to
intimidate
the
minority
group.
mr.
milton
kramer
pardon?
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
one
of
them,
i
submit,
is
scandalizing
the
court.
it's
imputing
their
integrity.
that's
one,
second
--
secondly,
diverting
the
attention
of
the
grand
jury.
now,
the
grand
jury
is
a
part
of
the
judicial
system
and
i
think
it's
established
in
georgia
that
--
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
well,
that
is
so
stipulated.
mr.
milton
kramer
pardon?
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
the
conviction
on
that
count
was
reversed.
these
were
two
press
releases.
it
was
not
--
they
were
not
sent
to
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
read
it
in
the
newspapers.
mr.
milton
kramer
if
a
member
of
the
grand
--
mr.
milton
kramer
if
--
mr.
milton
kramer
if
a
member
of
the
grand
jury
said
it
to
the
grand
jury?
mr.
milton
kramer
in
public?
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
--
mr.
milton
kramer
will
that
be
contempt
in
georgia?
under
this
portion
of
the
opinion
that
i
read,
i
presume
it
would.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
kramer
he
is
not
injecting
or
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
as
i
understood
the
entire
question,
it
was
whether
a
grand
jury
could
say
it
outside.
mr.
milton
kramer
of
course
not.
well
--
mr.
milton
kramer
in
very
--
mr.
milton
kramer
in
very
--
in
very
large
part.
well,
i've
gone
into
the
facts
in
considerable
detail
because
it
seems
to
me
that,
having
discussed
them
that
much,
the
--
there
was
a
very
little
to
discuss
about
the
law.
obviously,
i
rely
primarily
--
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
in
the
respondent's
brief,
they
tell
you
that
such
and
such
an
election,
1,001
out
of
1,200
so
and
so
negroes
voted
--
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
no
it's
separate
building
they
vote
in.
voting
is
in
the
same
building,
it's
on
separate
floors.
now,
this
isn't
in
the
record
and
i
don't
like
to
present
the
facts
that
aren't
in
the
record,
but
that
is
the
fact.
they
--
mr.
milton
kramer
the
negroes
vote
in
the
negro
high
school
and
the
white
people
vote
in
the
white
high
school.
in
the
courthouse,
negroes
vote
in
the
basement
and
white
people
vote
on
the
first
floor.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
you
vote
by
race.
you
go
different
places
by
race.
mr.
milton
kramer
it's
the
same
ballot,
but
i'm
really
departing
from
the
record.
i
don't
like
to
do
that.
your
tax
returns
are
on
different
colored
paper,
depending
on
whether
you're
white
or
negro.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
missed
one
word,
white
what?
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
think
it's
still
there
today.
the
legal
argument
is
really
very
simple.
i
--
the
court
below
held
that
a
conduct
that
has
a
tendency
to
obstruct
or,
in
another
place,
condunce
--
conduct
that
could
have
had
the
effect
of
diverting
the
grand
jury
is
enough
to
constitute
contempt.
now,
bridges
against
california,
pennekamp
against
florida
and
craig
against
harney
are
all
clearly
to
the
contrary.
i
might
point
out
that
the
dissent
in
pennekamp
against
florida
was
predicated
primarily
on
the
fact
that
there
was
an
attempt
at
intimidation.
now,
we
have
nothing
here
about
the
petitioner
who
was
held
in
contempt
trying
to
intimidate
anybody.
he
was
simply
criticizing
someone
else's
conduct.
also
in
the
pennekamp
and
the
craig
against
harney
cases,
this
court
held
that
it
examines
the
facts
for
itself
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
clear
and
present
danger
which
must
be
shown
and,
i'm
sure
you've
heard
the
words
many
times,
solid
evidence
and
that
the
effect
must
be
a
very
serious
one
and
something
more
than
probable
must
be
very
imminent
and
so
on.
this
case
meets
none
of
those
tests.
i
said
the
dissent
and
two
of
them,
or
at
least
one
of
them
was
predicated
primarily
on
intimidation
and
we
have
no
intimation
of
intimidation
here.
what
we
have
here
is
an
admitted
attempt
to
dust
off
a
law
that
hadn't
been
enforced
for
years.
the
judge,
himself
in
his
charge,
recognized
that
that
this
law
hadn't
been
enforced
for
a
great
many
years
and
he
was
asking
the
jury
to
consider
enforcing
it
against
the
negroes
and,
the
petitioner
said
he
thought
it
was
unfair
for
the
judge
to
do
that.
the
other
thing
he
did
was
to
say
that
if
bloc
voting
is
investigated,
investigate
it
all
over
not
just
by
negroes
and
he
said
further
that
if
the
judge's
charge
being
limited
to
negroes
would
be
construed
as
intimidation
and
all
his
criticism
was
of
the
judge,
not
of
the
grand
jury.
in
the
pennekamp
case,
the
court
indicated,
it
didn't
hold,
that
criticism
of
a
judge
in
a
case
that
was
going
to
a
petit
jury
there
would
have
too
speculative
effect
to
warrant,
holding
it
to
be
in
contempt.
now,
i'd
like
to
mention
another
consideration.
in
craig
against
harney,
both
the
majority
opinion
and
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
jackson
indicated
that
they
were
of
the
view
that
the
range
of
permissible
comment
about
judicial
proceedings
would
be
greater
in
a
case
where
public
issues
were
involved
than
it
would
be
in
the
ordinary
private
litigation.
now,
this
court
has
held
that,
it
has
indicated
it.
now,
if
that
is
the
consideration
then,
certainly,
it
would
strengthen
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here
because
this
charge
to
the
grand
jury
was
obviously
a
matter
of
great
public
importance
and
of
public
interest.
i
submit,
you
need
not
decide
that
here
because
even
if
the
range
of
the
permissible
conduct
for
that
were
narrower,
it
would
still
not
be
contempt.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
brief
for
the
respondent
to
point
out
certain
errors.
we
did
not
file
a
reply
brief.
i'd
like
to
point
them
out
here.
first,
on
page
6
--
mr.
milton
kramer
under
petition
for
certiorari?
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
we
did.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
blue
one.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
there
are
two
blue
ones.
it's
a
small
one.
it's
very
thin.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
it's
the
one
where
my
name
is
over
in
the
left
inside
of
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
respondent
says
that
he
said
so.
you
mean
was
he
in
fact
or
was
he
thinking
of
being
--
the
--
he
--
the
fact
is
he
was
not
a
candidate.
he
did
make
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
he
expected
to
run
in
the,
not
in
the
primary,
but
in
the
november
election
against
whoever
was
chosen
in
this
primary.
but
--
mr.
milton
kramer
now,
on
page
6
in
the
second
full
paragraph
of
the
respondent's
brief,
they
say
that
the
press
release
--
the
open
letter
to
the
grand
jury
implied
that
the
judge's
charge
was
false.
it
made
no
such
implication.
and,
secondly,
there,
they
are
talking
about
count
2,
the
open
letter
to
the
grand
jury.
the
conviction
on
which
it
was
reversed
and
review
was
not
sought.
this
is
a
--
they
start
out
right
here,
relying
on
things
in
count
2
because
maybe
the
conviction
on
count
2
should
have
been
sustained.
therefore,
the
conviction
on
counts
1
and
3
should
be
sustained.
i
just
don't
follow
the
reasoning
but
they
keep
relying
on
count
2.
on
page
8,
they
say
that
the
petitioner
offered
no
evidence
in
support
of
his
allegations.
well,
that
is
just
not
so.
it
was
stipulated,
and
the
stipulation
approved
by
the
court,
that
his
statements
and
his
response
would
be
accepted
as
evidence.
it
is
the
state
that
offered
no
evidence.
they
offered
none
at
all.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
think
i
would've
had
a
little
harder
time
not
because
of
what's
in
it
but
because
he
had
it
delivered
inside
the
jury
room.
that's
what
would
make
it
harder,
not
because
of
any
--
not
because
of
its
contents.
i
suppose
that
it
is
seriously
reprehensible
to
cause
documents
to
be
delivered
into
the
jury
room
with
indictment.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
i'm
sure
not
--
sure
not
--
of
course
not,
but
that
is
not
before
us.
that
was
reversed
and
no
review
sought
of
the
reversal.
it
is
the
states
that
offered
no
evidence
at
all.
we
did
have
evidence
in
there
in
support
of
all
our
allegations.
all
they
had
was
that
stipulation
that
he
was
the
sheriff,
that
the
judge
read
it,
that
the
jury
read
it,
and
that
the
jury
was
--
has
certain
documents
in
there
pertaining
to
an
election
in
which
he
had
been
a
candidate.
now,
on
page
19
of
the
respondent's
brief,
and
without
indicating
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
now,
on
page
19,
again,
the
respondent's
brief
quotes
apparently
indicating
that
it's
relevant
to
this
case
about
sending
a
letter
to
a
grand
jury.
again,
they're
referring
to
count
2
to
show
how
reprehensible
this
conduct
was
and
count
2
was
not
before
the
court.
now,
on
page
24,
near
the
top,
they
say
that
the
trial
court
simply
called
to
the
attention
of
the
grand
jury
a
georgia
criminal
statute.
well,
i
even
comment
on
that,
it
obviously
did
a
great
deal
more
than
that.
on
pages
28-29,
they
say
that
the
petitioner
did
not
mention
truth
as
a
defense.
well,
in
his
demurrers,
he
certainly
did.
he
complained
about
the
absence
of
an
allegation
of
untruth
and,
in
his
press
release,
he
--
of
which
they
criticize
him
--
in
his
response
to
the
petition
for
contempt,
he
said
that
the
reason
he
made
it
was
that
he
wanted
the
people
of
the
county
to
know
what
he
verily
and
sincerely
believed.
now,
i
take
it
that
is
an
allegation
of
truth.
now,
you
can
get
to
some
things
that
are
almost
amusing.
they
say
truth
is
an
affirmative
defense
in
georgia
which
must
be
raised
and
untruth
need
not
be
alleged.
now,
as
i've
shown,
it
was
raised,
but
their
citations
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
truth
is
an
affirmative
defense
and
must
be
raised
are
such
things
as,
well,
in
one
place
here,
“section
105708,”
which
we
cite
is
relevant
to
that
proposition.
105707
provides
that
if
a
white
woman
is
charged
with
having
had
sexual
intercourse
with
a
colored
man,
that
should
be
slander
without
proof
of
damage
and
then
708
says
that
truth
could
be
a
defense.
now,
what
relevance
that
has
to
a
case
like
this
is
beyond
my
comprehension.
the
other
citations
in
support
of
that
proposition
are
similar.
they
--
all
of
them
relate
to
the
admission
in
evidence
of
the
taking
into
consideration
the
court's
admitting
in
evidence
the
truth
of
the
libel
and
--
of
the
statement
in
a
criminal
libel
case.
mr.
milton
kramer
you
say
his
client
was
before
the
court
and
the
lawyer
gives
you
the
custody
--
mr.
milton
kramer
i
think
not.
now,
if
he
--
if
he
issued
different
kinds
of
press
releases
in
which
he
said
that
this
is
--
that
my
client
is
an
honest
man
and
he
didn't
steal
the
goods
and
the
grand
jury
shouldn't
believe
anybody
who
says
otherwise,
well,
that
would
be
tampering
with
the
grand
jury,
i
suppose.
that
would
be
different,
but
issue
a
press
release
on
a
political
matter
and
purely
political
matter,
he
wasn't
telling
the
grand
jury
what
to
find
or
what
not
to
find.
he
was
complaining
of
the
judge's
discriminatory
charge
singling
out
the
minority
group
to
be
investigated
and
no
one
else,
and
complaining
that
that
would
be
construed
or
might
have
the
effect
of
intimidation.
i
would
like
to
mention
one
more
thing
--
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
that
was
their
ground
that
he
has
the
right
to
call
the
attention
of
the
grand
jury
to
other
things
that
were
going
on.
it's
apparently
stopped
with
as
accepted
in
georgia
but
i
must
point
out
some
other
deficiencies
in
the
respondent's
brief
on
page
31.
on
page
31,
they
say
that
we
didn't
prove
anything
and
that
if
we
had
proven
certain
things,
they
would've
proven
something
else.
first,
near
the
top,
they
say
that
if
the
paci
--
if
the
--
but
had
petitioner
sought
to
adduce
proof
establishing
the
truth
of
this
emulated
allegations,
the
--
if
we
had
and
we
did.
it's
in
the
sworn
response
which
was
accepted
in
evidence
in
which
he
said
that
he
believed
in.
they
say
that
then
they
would've
been
prepared.
they
would've
proven
something
else.
now,
that's
something
else,
of
course
it's
not
in
the
record
and
it
should
be
disregarded
because
we
did
prove
it
and
even
if
we
hadn't,
it's
entirely
outside
the
record.
and,
that's
what
they
tell
you
that
1,001
out
of
1,262
negro
votes
had
been
cast
the
same
way
in
some
election.
then,
they
say
that
also
reliable
reports
indicated,
now,
that's
not
in
the
record.
then
they
say
the
response
alleged
that
petitioner
was
himself
a
candidate.
they
say
had
we
proven
that,
well,
the
response
does
prove
it
because
the
response
was
accepted
into
evidence.
they
say
had
we
proven
it,
they
would've
proven
something
else.
well,
that
something
else
is
not
in
the
record
and
they
have
no
right
to
insert
it
here
as
a
factual
statement.
but,
i
submit,
apart
from
all
that,
that
this
case
falls
far
short
of
the
standards
this
court
set
forth
in
bridges,
pennekamp,
and
craig
against
harney
and,
even
had
it
been
much
worse,
the
convictions
should
have
been
reversed.
i'll
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
issue
of
truth
was
injected,
as
your
honor
pointed
out
in
the
response
on
page
38
of
the
record.
he
did
respond
saying
that
he
truly
and
sincerely
believed
what
he
said,
and
that
was
accepted
as
evidence
by
stipulation.
i
would
like
to
close
this
comment
on
the
response
that
was
made
to
a
question
that
the
chief
justice
presented
to
mr.
ed
--
mr.
leverett.
the
chief
justice
asked
him
whether
it
is
common
practice
in
georgia
for
charges
to
the
grand
jury
to
be
in
open
court,
and
the
answer
was
yes.
it
is
not
common
practice
in
georgia
or
anywhere
else
to
summon
the
members
of
the
press
to
be
present
and
to
have
verbatim
copies
available
in
chambers
for
distribution.
i
think
he
--
mr.
milton
kramer
it
is
not
common
practice
in
georgia
or,
i
believe,
anywhere.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
in
bibb
county,
it
is
not
the
common
practice
to
summon
the
press
to
be
present
and
to
distribute
in
chambers,
copies
of
what
the
charge
was.
this
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
it
is
not
the
practice
in
--
the
answer
--
the
answer
to
that
was
given
to
the
question
should
be
supplemented
with
the
statement
that
it
is
not
common
practice
to
summon
the
jury
and
distribute
copies
in
the
judge's
chambers.
mr.
milton
kramer
perhaps
the
political
nature.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
but
the
political
nature
of
the
charge
is
highlighted
by
the
fact
that
it
was
done
here
when
it
is
not
done
otherwise.
