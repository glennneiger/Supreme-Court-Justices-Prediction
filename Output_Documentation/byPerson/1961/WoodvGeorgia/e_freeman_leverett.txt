mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
starting
my
argument
in
proper,
i
would
like
to
dispose
of
one
or
two
questions
that
have
been
raised
here
during
the
argument
of
mr.
kramer.
the
implication
was
sought
to
be
made
that
the
georgia
statute
in
question
here
related
only
to
campaign
workers.
that
is
not
so.
that
statute
was
two-pronged,
the
first
and
foremost
part
concern
the
buying
and
selling
of
votes.
it
enumerated
a
number
of
other
offenses
and
then,
down
at
the
end,
dealt
with
the
matter
of
campaign
workers.
secondly,
there
was
also
a
stipulation
in
the
record
that
was
sent
to
this
court,
but
it
was
not
printed
that
the
response
would
be
taken
as
traversed
without
the
necessity
of
the
state
having
to
file
a
formal
traverse.
the
stipulation
relating
to
the
response
also
was
that
it
would
be
accepted
as
a
tentative
evidence
only
as
to
the
statements
of
fact
and
not
as
to
the
statements
of
opinion.
now,
thirdly,
petitioner
says
that
it
can't
be
determined
definitely
whether
or
not
his
status
as
a
sheriff
had
anything
to
do
with
the
affirmance
of
the
convictions
on
the
two
counts.
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has
admitted
himself
out
of
court
because
under
the
rule
of
stembridge
versus
georgia,
if
it's
possible
that
the
case
was
disposed
of,
not
that
it
appears
that
it
was
but
if
it
was
a
mere
possibility
that
it
was
deposed
of
--
disposed
of
on
a
nonfederal
ground
that
that
is
sufficient
to
dismiss
certiorari
as
has
been
improvidently
granted.
i
would
call
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
if,
as
our
contention
it
will
make
further
on,
that
this
man
was
also
dealt
with
as
an
officer
of
court,
as
a
discipline
matter
as
distinguished
from
merely
a
contempt
which
is
an
entirely
different
thing,
the
sawyer
case.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
that
that
would
certainly
remove
the
application
of
the
bridges
case.
there
might
be
some
other
question
there
involved,
but
i
think
that
it
would
take
out
the
main
constitutional
question.
i'll
put
it
that
way.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
would
live
one.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
be
anything
likely
substantial
as
the
issue
that's
made
with
perspective
of
bridges
rule
proper.
at
page
72
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
if
it
please
the
court,
our
contention
is
that
the
state
here
was
dealing
with
this
man
in
two
aspects.
as
mr.
kramer
says,
it's
not
definite.
you
cannot
say
that
the
court
actually
held
that
it
was
disciplining
an
officer
of
court.
the
purpose
there,
when
you
proceed
against
an
officer
of
court,
is
not
so
much
to
prevent
obstruction
to
a
pending
proceeding,
which
is
the
bridges
question,
as
it
is
to
discipline
an
officer
of
court
for
his
contemptuous
conduct
toward
the
court.
we
say
that
if
this
case
can
be
supported
on
the
discipline
proposition,
that
that
certainly
removes
the
major
constitutional
question.
i
will
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
removes
it
entirely
because
he
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
right.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
right.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
because
the
evidence
was
insufficient
and
because
that's
a
lewisville
case
there.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think,
in
fairness,
i
should
say
that
if
you
would
but
i
do
not
believe
it
would
be
anything
as
substantial
as
the
other
one.
that
was
my
point.
i
did
not
--
at
page
72
of
the
record
--
69,
i
beg
the
court's
pardon.
demurrer
number
14
moves
to
strike
the
allegation
in
counts
1
and
3
to
the
effect
that
he
was
at
all
times
during
the
contemptuous
acts
to
the
society
was
sheriff
of
bibb
county.
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
in
fact
the
sheriff
of
bibb
county
at
the
time
and
he
is
such
an
officer
in
the
honorable
court
was
relevant
to
the
inquiry
and,
also,
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
t
--
presiding
judge
townsend,
he
emphasized
that
fact
at
page
72.
now,
the
fourth
point.
so
far
as
i
know,
there
was
no
judge
of
the
court
that
was
up
for
election
in
this
primary.
i
do
not
--
i'll
be
frank.
i
do
not
know
precisely.
i
could
not
say
definitely,
but
my
understanding
is
that
no
judge
was
running
for
reelection
in
this
primary.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
four
years
in
the
state
as
a
general.
now,
fulton
county
has
a
special
constitutional
amendment.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
bibb
county
is
four
years.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
think
they
--
i'm
not
certain
about
that.
i
don't
think
that
they
did
in
this
case.
now,
a
great
deal
has
been
said
about
our
reference
to
count
2
which
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
we
put
that
in
to
show
a
--
the
intention,
a
calculated
effort.
this
court
so
held
that
you
could
consider
the
--
this
matter
in
the
context
of
the
statements
preceeding
and
following
the
statement
which
is
actually
in
question,
that's
in
the
craig
case
331
u.s.
367
at
page
376.
that
is
the
reason
that
we
refer
to
count
2.
that's
the
reason
that
we
ask
that
that
statement,
it
was
a
letter
--
open
letter,
be
sent
up.
we
aren't
trying
to
get
a
reversal
on
that,
but
we
think
it
can
be
considered
to
show
--
to
remove
any
doubt
that
this
was
a
patent
effort
to
influence
the
grand
jury
in
a
pending
proceeding.
now,
mr.
kramer
also
said
that
contempt
here
was
directed
at
the
--
at
the
judges
in
every
place
where
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
this
question.
it
emphasized
the
fact
that
it
was
contempt
because
of
an
attempted
interference
with
the
proceedings
of
a
lay
grand
jury.
the
statement
has
also
been
made
in
argument
that
--
about
truth.
under
georgia
law,
i
think
the
necessary
effect
of
reading
these
statutes
is
that
truth
is
an
affirmative
defense
that
the
defendant
himself
must
raise.
the
state
does
not
have
to
negative
it
or
in
a
libel
case,
in
a
slander
case,
the
state
does
not
have
to
negative
the
issue
of
truth.
that
is
for
the
defendant
to
raise
it.
statement
has
also
been
made
that
this
case
was
not
decided
on
clear
and
present
danger,
page
67,
with
respect
to
the
question
as
to
whether
these
acts
of
the
defendant
constituted
a
clear,
present,
or
imminent
danger
or
serious
threat
to
the
administration
of
justice.
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
citation
so
amended
so
charges.
the
court
below
has,
by
its
conviction,
so
found
and
the
evidence
supports
the
finding.
of
more
importance
is
the
fact
there
--
that
the
conviction
on
count
2
was
reversed
because,
as
the
court
said,
the
state
had
failed
to
show
a
clear
and
present
danger.
now,
georgia
has
a
statute
which
declares
it
a
crime,
anyone
to
engage
in
the
buying
or
selling
of
votes.
there's
nothing
particularly
unusual
or
certainly
nothing
harsh
about
this
statute.
it
differs
little
from
section
597
of
the
criminal
code.
it's
been
on
the
books
since
1833.
its
constitutionality
is
not
under
attack
in
this
proceeding.
bibb
county,
georgia
is
one
of
the
large
metropolitan
area
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia.
on
june
6,
one
of
the
three
judges
of
that
court
delivered
the
charge
which
has
been
referred
to
here
previously.
the
court
directed
the
jury
to
consider
the
statute
with
respect
to
widespread
reports
of
voting
or
buying
of
votes
by
certain
political
candidates
from
certain
political
leaders
of
the
negro
race.
it
was
pointed
out
that
these
charges,
they
derive
corroboration
from
the
fact
that
in
prior
elections
in
which
there
were
no
racial
issues
whatever
involved,
that
there
had
been
des
--
demonstrated
an
inane
palate
of
negro
bloc
voting.
the
court
further
advised
the
jury
of
other
charges
to
the
effect
that
reports
have
been
made
that
the
candidates
had
met
with
some
of
these
negro
leaders
and
had
been
promised
their
support
only
to
later
have
that
support
go
to
another
candidate
who
had
met
with
these
leaders
and
paid
them
large
sums
of
money.
sometimes,
so
the
court
stated,
this
money
was
paid
ostensibly
for
advertising
in
radio
or
published
and
so
forth
but
that
it
appeared
that
it
was
in
fact
understood
by
the
parties
to
be
an
outright
purchase
of
the
votes.
that
is
the
implication
of
the
charge.
there
was
nothing
improper
or
objectionable
about
this
charge.
it
was
phrased
in
a
conventional
sober
language
of
the
courtroom.
strong
adjectives,
coarse
phrases,
inflammatory
etiquettes
were
avoided.
the
charge
called
no
names
nor
did
it
assume
that
offenses
had
in
fact
been
committed.
it
left
it
clear
that
the
responsibility
of
resolving
these
factual
issues
was
on
the
jury.
the
court
was
capital
to
state
that
bloc
voting
was
not
illegal
per
se
but
only
when
it
was
as
the
result
of
a
bargain
and
sale
or
when
there
was
some
conspiracy
by
domineering
organizations.
no
effort
was
made
to
intimidate,
harass
or
threaten
anyone.
there
was
no
appeal
to
racial
prejudice
or
to
inflame
racial
passions.
racial
prejudice
is
--
is
crept
into
this
case.
it
is
there
because
the
petitioner
put
it
there
and
not
because
of
the
state.
the
court
here
simply
discharged
its
traditional
function,
charging
the
jury
with
respect
to
a
state
criminal
statute
and
widespread
reports
of
its
violation.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
my
understanding
is,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
that
it
is
always
done
in
open
court.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right.
i
may
be
--
i
may
not
be
right,
but
i
--
that's
my
understanding.
now,
we
say
the
fact
that
negro
political
leaders
happen
to
be
involved
in
this
case
doesn't
change
it
in
the
least.
they
aren't
immune
from
the
law.
well,
much
has
been
said
here
in
the
briefs
about
prejudice.
we
would
like
to
tell
to
the
res
--
the
petitioner
to
take
heath
lest
that
he
himself
(inaudible).
the
record
does
not
show
and
this
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
to
rephrase
it,
i
was
simply
saying,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
the
prejudice
in
this
case
has
been
injected
by
the
petitioner
himself.
this
court
cannot
assume
that
the
facts,
circumstances,
and
conditions
referred
to
in
the
court's
charge
did
not
in
fact
exist.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir,
the
record
does
not.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
if
he
might
have
gone
to
the
evidentiary
stage,
we
think
we
could've
shown
that
it
was
primarily
a
municipal
election
that
had
been
held
in
that
year,
but
that's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that,
i
could
not
answer.
i
do
not
know.
it
has
apparently
been
interpreted
or
construed
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
that
it
certainly
should,
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
primary
was,
i
believe
the
june
20th.
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
it
is
in
the
record
somewhere.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
he
was
not
a
candidate
in
this
election.
i
do
not
think
he
actually
ran
in
the
general
election
in
november.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
right,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
that
does
not
--
i
have
previously
stated
at
the
outset
that
my
understanding
is
that
they
were
not
and
none
of
them
were
running,
but
i
do
not
have
definite
information.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
macon,
georgia
about
the
second
or
third
or
fourth
largest
city
in
the
state.
we
say
that
to
make
a
charge
that
this
was
prejudice
is
itself
an
instance
of
prejudice
where
there
are
no
facts
at
all
to
substantiate
the
charges
that
the
petitioner
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
how
can
you
assume
that
they
are
if
they're
not
in
the
record?
the
judges
are
presumed
to
follow
the
law
and
to
form
that
unit
properly.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir,
because
he
did
not
at
any
time
undertake
to
prove
that
it
was
not
true
what
the
court
had
said.
he
filed
his
response,
but
his
response
did
not
and
we
contest
that
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
was
under
oath
but
it
did
not
raise
the
issue
of
truth.
his
demurrers
raised
the
issue
of
truth
and
that
was
a
question
of
pleading.
if
he
had
--
if
he
had
sought
to
prove
truth,
then
the
state
would
have
brought
in
evidence
to
show
the
background
in
all
the
various
circumstances
relative
to
support
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
think
that
it
technically
would
have
under
this
court's
decision
in
patterson
versus
colorado,
but
where
someone
makes
an
offer
of
proof,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
to
prevent
the
state
from
rebutting
it
for
purposes
of
appellate
record.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
believe
it
was
quite
that
strong.
i
think
he
said
that
he
barely
--
he
wanted
to
present
his
opinion
or
something
to
that
effect.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
was
just
getting
to
that.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
if
it
please
the
court,
i
interpret
that
merely
to
mean
a
disavow
of
any
contemptuous
intent.
i
do
not
construe
that
to
mean
to
be
a
plea
of
truth.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
if
it
please
the
court,
likewise,
i
do
not
interpret
that
as
a
plea
of
truth.
in
fact,
the
petitioner's
--
one
of
his
contentions
is
he
does
not
himself
contend
that
this
was
an
effort
to
prove
truth
because
one
of
his
contentions
that
he
presented
in
his
brief
was
that
we
prevented
him
from
proving
truth
as
a
defense.
we
will
answer
that
in
due
course.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
--
the
supreme
court
did
not
write
an
opinion.
it
just
denied
certiorari.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
do
not
think
that
it
did
under
this
court's
opinion
in
the
patterson
case
and
the
holding
in
this
case.
we
do
say
that
if
there
had
been
an
effort
to
prove
truth,
if
the
state
would
have
set
and
rebutted
it,
regardless
of
whether
it
was
proper
or
not
as
a
matter
of
strategy
at
the
time
that
it
came
up.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
he
was
convicted
of
contempt
pursuant
to
a
statute,
two
statutes,
one
dealing
with
officers
only
and
another
dealing
with
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it's
not
clear
from
the
opinion
because
of
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
the
court
did
not
actually
decide
either
way
because
they
said
that
the
statute
is
24105,
i
believe
it
is,
that
it
is
not
declaratory
of
the
contempt
file
of
a
constitutional
court.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
20
days
$200.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
do
not
know.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
the
georgia's
courts
recognize
that
the
power
of
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
to
limit

there's
no

about
that.
they
have
simply
said
that
the

mr.

i'm

i
believe
the

said
that
it's
not

to
resolve
the
issue
as
to
whether
this
conduct
comes
within
the
meaning
of

the
georgia
supreme

had
just
recently
interpreted
this
24105

it
reversed

this
charge
was
delivered
on
june
6,
the
next
day.
rather,
that
day,
the
grand
jury
retired
to
consider
its
deliberations.
the
following
day,
while
it
was
actually
engaged
in
investigating
this
very
matter,
sheriff
wood
issued
this
press
release
from
the
same
courthouse
in
which
the
grand
jury
was
sitting.
the
statement
in
vitriolic
language
attacked
the
courts
and,
in
effect,
told
the
jury
not
to
consider
the
investigation
that
the
court
had
directed
them
to
make.
the
court's
charge
was
characterized
as
race
agitation,
a
crude
attempt
to
judicial
intimidation,
persecution
of
the
few,
racial
prejudice,
and
intimidation
no
different
in
principle
than
that
from
the
k--
used
by
the
kkk.
the
following
day,
he
also
delivered
his
open
letter
to
the
grand
jury
itself
in
which
he
very
care
--
shrewdly
mimicked
the
court's
charge.
he
followed
it
almost
step
by
step
and
said
“it's
really
not
who
the
court
has
said
that
is
guilty
of
this
violation
of
the
law
but
it's
a
democratic
executive
committee.”
it
was
stipulated
that
both
of
this
documents
were
actually
raised
by
members
of
the
grand
jury
while
they
were
considering
the
very
issue
in
question.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
right,
sir.
the
grand
jury
proceeding
continued
and
approximately
one
month
later,
on
june
--
on
july
the
7th
and
an
attachment
for
contempt
was
issued
against
petitioner,
charging
him
with
contempt
of
court
in
making
the
first
press
release.
the
following
day,
july
the
8th,
petitioner
released
another
statement
in
which
he
again
reiterated
most
of
his
prior
charges
and
just
went
down
the
line
practically
and
said
“i
said
this
and
i'm
saying
it
now”
and
he
further
said
that
his
defense
would
be
true.
he
--
again,
the
investigation
was
still
pending
and
this
statement
was
read
also
by
members
of
the
grand
jury.
subsequent
amendments
added
the
open
letter
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
it's
stipulated
in
the
record.
subsequent
amendments
to
the
contempt
proceedings
added
the
open
letter
as
count
2
and
the
july
8
press
release
is
count
3.
petitioner
filed
demurrers
in
response.
after
hearing,
the
court
imposed
the
sentences.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
it's
privileged
under
georgia
law.
i
don't
think
you
could
get
it
that
far.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
record
does
not
show
that.
the
record
does
not
show
that,
one
way
or
another.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes,
sir.
they
made
a
report.
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
they
made
findings
that
they
had
been
widespread
violations,
that
there
were
two
groups
there
that
were
accepting
money
but
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
two
--
one
group
involving
an
alexander
and
another
involving
the
hoopa,
that
they
were
leaders
of
certain
factions
and
that
they
had
received
money
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
believe
they
--
the
neg
--
the
leaders
were
of
the
negro
voters
association.
the
money
is
allegedly
been
paid
by
white
candidates
to
the
negro
leaders.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
recall
anything
having
been
said
about
that.
we
feel
that
there
are
two
questions
and
two
questions
only
that
are
really
presented
by
this
petition
for
certiorari.
the
first
one
is
what
was
the
test
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
evaluating
these
statements.
the
second
question
is,
assuming
that
this
test
was
clear
and
present
danger,
as
we
contend,
was
the
test
properly
applied?
now,
there
is
a
third
issue
that
the
petitioner
seeks
to
make
here
which
we
will
show
was
not
raised
in
the
trial
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
or
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
filed
in
this
court,
and
that
relates
to
his
contention
that
he
was
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
proving
truth
as
a
defense.
eight
years
prior
to
this
court's
1944
decision
in
the
bridges
case,
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
had
rejected
the
common
law
scandalizing
the
court
test
in
townsend
versus
state.
and,
what
has
become
to
be
the
leading
case
in
georgia
on
constructive
contempt,
the
mcgill
case,
cited
in
1953.
the
court
declared
that
the
common
law
rule
was
no
longer
in
effect
in
georgia
by
virtue
of
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
speech
and
press.
the
court
in
this
case
declared
that
while
the
power
to
punish
for
contempt
was
inherent
in
courts
of
record,
that
this
inherent
power
itself
was
limited
by
the
constitutional
provisions
or
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
i
interpret
that
at
the
bottom
of
the
paragraph
on
page
66.
count
2
must
stand
alone
to
meet
the
test
of
whether
it
constitutes
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
administration
of
justice,
mcgill
versus
state,
and
it
fails
to
meet
this
test.
the
court
erred
in
holding
the
defendant
in
contempt.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
that
the
court
is
saying
before
that
this
did
not
--
could
not
on
its
face
be
construed
as
being
an
attempt
or
having
the
effect
of
influencing
the
grand
jury
and
we
cannot
consider
that
this
is
a
part
of
a
pattern.
we've
got
to
interpret
this
by
itself.
it
think
that's
not
--
the
court
was
not
necessary
to
go
that
far
in
view
of
the
craig
case,
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
and,
of
course,
it's
presumed
in
it's
binding
here.
in
the
present
case,
the
amended
petition
for
contempt
allege
that
petitioner's
statements
were
issued
while
the
grand
jury
deliberation
was
in
progress
and
that
they
constituted
a
clear,
present,
and
imminent
danger
to
the
investigation
and
administration
of
justice,
page
43.
throughout
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
emphasis
was
placed
on
the
fact
that
this
was
an
interference,
an
obstruction
with
a
pending
grand
jury
investigation.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
repeatedly
referred
to
petitioner's
statements
as
being
contemptuous
because
of
the
obstruction
and
interference
with
the
pending
proceeding,
and
the
court
specifically
held
that
the
evidence
on
both
counts
supports
the
finding
clear
and
present
danger.
a
compelling
significance,
as
i
have
just
stated,
is
the
fact
that
in
reversing
on
count
2,
the
court
of
appeals
assigned
as
its
reason
the
fact
that
it
did
not
meet
the
test
of
clear
and
present
danger.
now
petitioner's
argument
that
clear
and
present
danger
was
not
used
is
based
entirely
upon
some
statements
taken
from
carr
versus
state
which
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
already
conceded,
were
misquoted
in
his
brief.
in
that
connection,
we
say
that,
while
undoubtedly,
the
castigating
of
the
--
excuse
me.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
recess,
i
was
undertaking
to
show
that,
in
this
case,
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
had
in
fact
applied
to
a
clear
and
present
danger
test.
only
seven
months
after
the
wood
decision,
a
decision
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
in
the
renfro
case
"but
even
constitutional
courts
are
limited
to
the
extent
that
there
must
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
administration
of
justice,"
citing
the
wood
case
as
authority
for
that
holding.
that
decision
was
rendered
by
a
judge
of
the
same
division
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
as
the
judge
who
wrote
the
decision
--
the
majority
decision
in
the
wood
case.
coming
now
to
the
application
by
the
court
of
that
route,
we
might
state
as
a
matter
of
state
substantive
law
that
the
grand
jury,
as
an
arm
of
the
court
and
that
its
proceedings
constitute
a
judicial
proceeding.
consequently,
any
effort
to
interfere,
to
influence
the
grand
jury
is
punishable
to
the
same
extent,
so
the
cases
say,
there's
an
effort
to
influence
or
interfere
with
the
petit
jury.
judge
field's
famous
charge
delivered
in
1872
to
the
grand
jury,
he
deplored
the
frequent
efforts
of
"private
prosecutors
to
intrude
themselves
into
your
presence
to
obtain
or
prevent
to
present
one
or
indictment
of
parties."
the
significance
attached
to
grand
jury
proceedings
is
very
well
borne
out
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
reference
to
jury
selection.
the
court
has
held
that
even
though
a
defendant
is
convicted
by
a
jury
in
which
there
was
no
discrimination
and
in
which
there
was
ample
evidence
to
support
the
verdict
of
conviction.
nevertheless,
if
there
was
discrimination
in
selection
of
the
grand
jury,
the
conviction
will
be
set
aside.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
attempt
to
explain
it.
i
think
it's
wrong,
but
the
state
did
not
undertake
to
have
it
reviewed
below
and,
of
course,
i
say
you
can't
do
so
in
this
juncture.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
right.
well,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
right,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
would
simply
say
that
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
so
holding
the
count
two.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
would
simply
say
that,
in
my
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
count
two,
in
holding
that
there
was
no
clear
and
present
danger.
i
think
that
there
was.
but
i
think,
there,
our
whole
reasoning
was
based
upon
the
assumption
that
they
could
consider
only
that
particular
letter
and
that
on
its
face,
that
letter
did
not
indicate
that
it
would
interfere,
that
it
perhaps
was
bringing
something
new
to
the
attention
of
the
grand
jury.
in
some
states
do
permit
that
so
long
as
a
communication
to
a
grand
jury
does
not
deal
with
a
pending
matter
if
it
undertakes
to
inject
a
new
claim
or
a
new
charge
that
they
commit
that.
that
has
been
upheld
in
some
states.
i
know
of
no
particular
authority
in
georgia
one
way
or
another.
efforts
to
influence
grand
juries
are
declared
crimes
by
title
18
section
1504.
they
are
uniformly
held
punishable
as
contempt
by
the
state
cases.
now,
coming
to
the
application
of
the
test,
the
three
decisions
of
this
court,
applying
the
clear
and
present
danger
test,
all
involved
entirely
different
factual
considerations.
the
bridges,
pennekamp,
and
craig
cases
involved
criticism
of
judicial
action
already
taken
or
statements
which
it
most
could
be
construed
as
efforts
to
influence
the
trial
judge
himself,
not
the
lay
jury
and
a
great
emphasis
was
placed
upon
that
in
concurring
opinions
in
the
shepherd
case,
shepherd
versus
florida,
that
was
reiterated
time
and
time
again
in
mr.
justice
reed's
decision,
i
believe,
in
the
pennekamp
case,
the
assumption
being
that
judges
are
supposed
to
be
superior
individuals
who
can
resist
these
external
pressures.
this
case
is,
in
a
sense,
the
first
in
which
a
full
court
has
been
faced
with
the
very
issue
here.
the
case
most
likely
or
liken
to
it
is
people
versus
parker,
an
illinois
case
where
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
contempt
in
sending
the
letter
to
the
grand
jury
urging
them
to
investigate
the
chicago
tribune.
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
vote.
even
there,
however,
that
case
is
not
as
strong
as
this
because
there,
as
i
just
previously
said,
was
an
effort
to
bring
a
new
charge
to
the
attention
of
the
grand
jury.
here,
there
was
an
effort
to
obstruct
and
to
interfere
with
a
charge
that
had
already
been
given
to
the
grand
jury
by
the
court.
another
case
which
somewhat
approaches
this
problem
is
maryland
versus
baltimore
radio
show.
in
that
case,
the
maryland
court,
under
its
interpretation
of
the
bridges
formula,
it
set
aside
the
contempt
conviction
of
a
radio
station.
this
station
had
published
or,
rather,
had
broadcast
extensively
the
fact,
about
two
days
after
a
brutal
crime
had
been
committed,
that
the
accused
had
been
arrested,
that
he
had
confessed,
that
he'd
gone
out
and
reenacted
the
crime,
and
that
he
picked
up
the
bloody
knife
from
underneath
some
leaves
and
they
also
broadcast
his
prior
record.
the
maryland
court,
applying
the
bridges
formula,
found
that
there
had
been
no
clear
and
present
danger.
however,
we
say
that
case
is
distinguishable.
to
begin
with,
the
opinion
denying
certiorari
by
this
court
was
very
careful
to
point
out
that
the
denial
in
no
way
was
to
be
construed
either
as
an
approval
or
disapproval
of
a
decision
of
the
maryland
court.
secondly,
the
broadcast
was
made
the
day
following
the
arrest
of
the
person.
it
had
a
certain
news
value
at
that
time.
the
maryland
court
expressly
declared
"that
it
was
not
concern
with
deliberate
attempts
to
influence
the
outcome
of
a
pending
case
for
the
reason
that
the
statements
there
made
were
news
reports
and
were
not
argumentative
in
nature."
now
here,
on
the
other
hand,
we
say
that
this
case
is
framed
in
the
strongest
possible
light.
the
proceeding
was
pending.
in
one
pending
just
in
a
technical
lawyer
sense.
it
was
pending
in
a
realistic
sense
to
the
extent
that
the
jury
was
then
considering
the
very
matter
in
issue.
these
statements
by
their
clear
urging
told
the
jury
to
do
one
thing
when
the
court
had
just
charged
it
to
do
something
else.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
do
not
know,
sir.
i
cannot
answer
the
question.
i
don't
think
there
has
been
a
case
on
that.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think,
of
course,
that
one
distinct
difference
is
that
there
was
no
evidence
here,
no
proof
that
this
man
was
under
investigation.
this
charge
of
the
court
did
not
call
any
names.
it
just
said
there'd
been
reports.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
--
there
had
been
--
there
are
some
cases
cited
in
the
brief
dealing
with
situations
where
comments
were
made
pending
a
grand
jury
investigation.
i
believe
that
one
of
them
is
either
the
kilpatrick
of
the
--
one
of
the
tribune
cases
in
there
in
which
they
held
if
he
went
to
a
certain
extent,
that
it
would
be.
in
one
case,
i
think
he
threatened
to
sue
the
grand
jurors
and
they
said
that
was
very
clearly
a
contempt
of
court.
it
was
an
effort
to
influence
a
pending
proceeding.
thirdly
--
or
fourthly,
these
statements
were
made
in
the
same
courthouse
where
the
grand
jury
was
sitting.
they
were
made
by
a
high
office
of
court
whose
duty
was
to
attend
upon
and
to
assist
the
grand
jury
that
he
was
seeking
to
influence.
they
were
actually
read
by
members
of
the
grand
jury.
we
submit
that
unless
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
which
distinction?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
certainly
puts
the
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
that
i
believe
that,
to
the
mind
of
a
layman,
a
statement
made
by
a
sheriff
in
the
courthouse
where
the
jury
was
sitting
would
be
far
more
likely
to
have
an
effect
upon
a
juror's
mind
than
if
the
statement
had
been
made
by
someone
who
was
not
the
sheriff
or
made
at
a
distance
from
the
court.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
that
it
certainly
would
have
some
relevance.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
that
it
would.
i
think
that
in
the
mind
of
--
a
lay
juror
could
very
well
say
that,
gather
some
impression
from
it
regardless
of
whether
or
not
we,
as
lawyers,
would.
the
question
here
is
the
effect
upon
the
jury,
not
upon
--
on
a
lawyer
or
a
judge.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
apparently,
the
thought
here
was
that
we
were
getting
into
the
now
question,
i
presume,
there.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
his
con
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
would
not
think
so.
i
think
the
purpose
for
the
court's
doing
that
was
--
so
that
if
anyone
had
any
information,
they
could
bring
it
into
before
the
grand
jury
in
the
proper
manner
by
going
to
the
solicitor
general
and
saying
that
"i
have
some
evidence.
would
you
see
if
the
grand
jury
would
like
me
to
testify?"
i
think
that
would
be
the
purpose
of
the
court's
doing.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
think
the
law
actually
says
that.
i
think
that
has
been
perhaps
the
procedure.
i'm
not
even
certain
about
that.
of
course
you
can
always
bring
it
before
the
grand
jury
by
taking
out
a
warrant.
then,
the
grand
jury
inevitably
will
summon
you
and
let
you
testify
in
support
of
your
warrant.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
this
is
the
first
case
that
i
know
of
that
has
actually
dealt
with
this
question.
i
do
not
know
of
any
case.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
true.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
quite
true.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
as
to
new
charges,
not
as
to
charges
already
pending.
that,
generally,
i
think,
is
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
was
basing
my
assumption
on
the
law
review
article
in
39
journal
of
criminal
law.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
leads
to
that
question.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
indirectly,
i
will
come
to
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
it's
inevitable
that
the
freedoms
of
speech
will
become
--
at
some
time,
come
into
conflict
with
the
necessity
for
a
fair
trial.
and,
in
this
case,
as
in
the
case
of
any
conflict
between
any
other
to
freedoms,
this
court
has
to
weigh
the
situation
in
the
light
of
all
the
circumstances.
as
stated
in
the
pennekamp
case,
the
comments
must
be
appraised
on
a
balance
between
the
desirability
of
free
discussion
and
the
necessity
for
fair
adjudication.
and,
what
is
the
interest
here?
the
interest
of
the
state
of
georgia
and
this
is
a
very
weighty
interest,
it's
no
less
important
to
georgia
than
the
threat
from
internal
subversion.
the
interest
is
two-fold,
unhampered
grand
jury
proceedings
as
a
general
matter.
on
the
georgia
law,
it's
necessary
to
have
a
grand
jury
indictment
to
prosecute
all
felonies.
the
defendant
cannot
even
waive
a
grand
jury
indictment
in
a
capital
felony.
he
can
in
non-capital
felonies,
in
writing,
waive
the
indictment
but
an
indictment
is
an
essential
beginning
point
for
a
criminal
prosecution.
and,
of
course,
there's
a
danger
that
improper
influences
creep
into
the
grand
jury
room.
the
indictment,
itself,
would
be
subject
to
being
quashed
on
motion.
secondly,
we
think
that
the
other
weighting
interest
that
the
state
of
georgia
has
is
the
necessity
of
enforcing
its
voting
laws.
and,
i
know
--
also,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
here
that
the
choice
here
was
not
between
silence
and
the
right
of
this
petitioner
to
speak
his
views.
he
very
conceivably
might
have
been
on
a
different
position
entirely
if
he
waited
until
after
this
grand
jury
proceeding
was
over.
but,
let's
assume,
in
the
words
of
the
bridges
case,
that
freedom
does
not
bare
an
inverse
ratio
or
up
to
the
timeliness
of
the
assertions
seeking
expression.
even
here,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
make
any
difference
for
this
reason.
the
petitioner
could
have
asked
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
i
understand
that
he
actually
did.
that's
not
in
the
record
but
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
know
whether
he
asked.
i
understood
he
testified.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
he
did
appear.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
let's
assume
further
that
he
asked
and
was
refused.
let's
assume
even
further
that
he,
himself,
was
being
investigated.
this
court
has
already
passed
on
such
a
situation
and
found
that
there
is
no
sufficient
societal
interest
in
that
type
of
utterance.
in
hannah
versus
larche,
this
court
held
that
no
one
has
a
right
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
and
state
his
contentions
because
of
the
disruptive
influence
their
injection
would
have
on
the
proceedings.
and,
what
we've
said
we
think
would
be
sufficient,
even
as
against
a
private
person,
a
fortiori,
whereas,
here,
the
defendant
was
himself
an
officer
of
the
court.
the
sawyer
case,
i
think,
comes
into
this
case
in
this
respect.
in
that
case,
a
lawyer
was
being
disciplined
for
doing
just
what
we
have
conceded
that
a
private
person
could
not,
that
is
scandalizing
the
judge.
this
court
did
not
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
it
but
it's
conceded.
but
it
seemed
to
assume
that,
as
to
a
lawyer,
that
that
would
be
a
permissible
rule
of
conduct
to
be
applied.
that
the
--
the
court's
opinion
turned
on
the
fact
that
the
utterances
there
were
not
aimed
at
the
judge
but
were
aimed
in
general
at
this
mere
fact
and
there
was
no
effort
to
scandalize
the
judge
in
that
particular
proceeding.
and,
also,
another
point
about
this
dual
personality
of
mr.
wood,
i
think,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
the
opinion
there
stated
that
it's
immaterial
whether
or
not
mrs.
sawyer
was
counsel
in
that
particular
case
or
not
that
the
official
transaction
thing
doesn't
have
too
much
to
do
in
that
particular
context.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
it
makes
it
strong.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
it
makes
it
stronger
than
he
was.
i
do
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
not
think
it's
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
essential
that
he
have
to.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
it
changes
it.
i
do
not
think
that
if
he
had
not
been
sheriff,
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
here
to
uphold
the
clear
and
present
danger
test.
we
say
that,
because
he
was
sheriff,
that
it
makes
it
even
stronger.
now,
even
if
we
resurrect
this
blackstone
and
fox
controversy
and
invest
it
with
constitutional
dignity,
we
would
reach
the
same
result
because
fox
says
that,
while
these
constructive
contempt
have
not
pry
to
blackstone's
comments
with
reference
to
the
ollman
case,
had
not
been
dealt
with
summarily
that,
historically
and
traditionally
contempts
by
--
contempts
by
officers
of
the
court
had
been
treated
summarily.
and
here,
the
court
had
instructed
the
jury
to
perform
a
stated
function.
the
defendant
interjected
himself
and
told
them
not
to.
one
last
contention
i
think
that
should
be
discussed
with
respect
to
the
application
of
this
test,
concerns
the
assertion
made
that
you
must
show
that
the
obstruction
actually
succeeded.
that's
not
what
this
court
held
in
the
bridges
case.
it
held
that
you
must
show
that
there
was
a
danger,
not
that
the
obstruction
actually
succeeded.
now,
petitioner
says
that
the
pennekamp
case
holds
that
the
danger
must
be
shown
by
solid
evidence
but
that's
not
what
the
court
said.
the
court
said
that
the
circumstances
likely
to
give
rise
to
a
clear
and
present
danger
test
must
be
shown
by
"a
solidity
of
evidence."
if
actual
obstruction
is
shown,
there's
no
need
for
a
rule
phrased
in
terms
of
a
danger
because
the
evil
itself,
and
not
just
its
danger,
would
already,
thereby,
be
a
theatre
colloquy.
one
thing
we
certainly
do
not
dispute
and
that
is
that
the
mere
utterances
themselves
are
sufficient
in
the
same
sense
that,
in
a
tort
action,
certain
utterance
is
--
would
be
conce
--
deemed
libelous
per
se.
we
say
you
have
to
consider
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
time
and
manner
the
--
the
nature
of
the
pending
proceedings,
susceptibility
of
the
particular
fact-finding
body
in
any
and
all
other
circumstances
which
will
have
any
relevance
on
the
question
as
to
whether
the
substantive
evil
would
likely
come
about.
this
was
the
procedure
followed
in
the
great
cases
of
bridges,
the
pennekamp,
and
the
craig
cases.
in
the
pennekamp
case
--
or
rather,
in
the
bridges
case,
emphasis
was
placed
on
the
fact
that
the
statements
were
made
after
trial
and
did
not
communicate
any
information
which
the
court
did
not
already
know
anyway.
there
was
no
effort
to
influence
the
jury.
in
the
pennekamp
case,
you
have
substantially
the
same
thing.
criticism
was
a
judicial
action
already
taken,
page
348.
it
did
not
deal
with
rulings
during
the
jury
trial,
also
page
348.
and,
the
florida
court
had
expressly
questioned
the
applicability
of
the
bridges
rule
to
that
particular
case.
that's
at
page
345
at
footnote
6.
in
the
craig
case,
the
pertinent
facts
were
that
the
publications
were
simply
news
reports
or
public
business
and
it
most
could
be
construed
as
calculated
to
influence
not
the
jury
but
the
judge
who
the
court
said,
"is
supposed
to
be
a
man
of
fortitude,
able
to
strive
in
a
hearty
climate."
petitioners
also
argue
that
a
prejudicial
and
inflammatory
charge
should
not
be
made
the
basis
of
contempt.
well,
to
begin
with,
we
do
not
concede
that
the
statement
of
the
charge
of
the
court
was
prejudicial
and
inflammatory.
we
say,
on
the
contrary,
that
it
was
entitled
probably
to
respect.
well,
even
assuming
arguendo
otherwise,
the
law
is
that
even
an
erroneous
ruling
of
a
court
does
not
excuse
contemptuous
conduct.
this
court,
therefore,
let
it
link
in
the
united
mine
workers
case.
now,
there
are
three
cases
that
are
cited
for
this
contention.
the
louisiana
and
the
nebraska
cases
simply
hold
that
a
lawyer
should
not
be
adjudged
in
contempt
for
filing
a
motion
to
caution
indictment
in
which
he
alleges
that
that
indictment
was
obtained
as
the
result
of
an
improper
charge
by
the
grand
jury
or
by
the
court.
obviously,
we
don't
contest
that.
the
mississippi
case
simply
held
that
a
lawyer
--
that
--
rather
than
an
indictment
itself
should
be
quashed
where
the
judge
had
in
effect,
directed
the
return
of
an
indictment
by
a
charge
which
actually
assumed
that
crimes
had
been
committed.
the
last
contention
that
i
come
to
deals
with
a
point
that,
as
we
contend,
has
not
been
made
in
this
case.
the
demurrers
--
that
is
the
issue
of
truth,
the
demurrers
themselves
raise
the
question
that
the
petition
for
contempt
did
not
allege
that
the
statements
made
were
false
or
untrue.
however,
as
i
--
as
we've
previously
stated,
we
do
not
believe
that
his
answer
or
his
response
raised
the
issue
of
truth.
that
would
be
a
plea
on
the
georgia
practice.
it
would
have
to
be
a
little
more
formality
attached
to
it
in
many
some
statements
of
opinion.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it's
in
the
--
in
dealing
with
the
rulings
on
the
demurrers,
page
67.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it's
a
rule
--
it's
a
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
only
as
a
question
of
pleading.
that
is
the
question.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
if
he
made
those
statements
in
a
campaign
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
if
he
had
made
it
at
this
particular
time
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
that
that
would
be
different
for
this
reason.
there,
the
purpose
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
would
not
know
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
couldn't,
but
i
think
it
would
certainly
be
a
stronger
case
for
this
reason.
there,
the
purpose
of
the
statement
was
to
--
for
a
political
campaign
for
office.
here,
it
was
obviously
for
the
purpose
of
obstructing
a
grand
jury.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
would
be
an
argument
but
i
don't
concede
the
validity
of
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
think
you
could
in
this
case.
i
think
you
might
in
your
hypothetical
case
because,
there,
he's
running.
he's
in
a
race.
he's
actually
in
a
race.
but,
here,
he
was
not.
he
had
already
announced
he
wasn't
running.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
primary.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
(inaudible)
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that,
in
one
case,
the
man
was
actually
out
campaigning
against
the
judge.
that
was
the
hypothetical
output
to
me.
in
this
case,
he
was
not
running
in
this
--
in
this
primary
election.
he
says
a
campaign
was
in
afoot,
but
he
was
not
a
part
of
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
possibly
sir.
in
any
event
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
he
was
not
a
candidate
against
the
judge.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir,
i
didn't
say
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes,
sir.
getting
back
to
this
issue
of
truth,
the
georgia
practice
requires
that
a
party
make
an
offer
of
proof
and
that
a
special
assignment
of
error
be
presented
in
the
bill
of
exceptions.
that
was
not
done
in
this
case.
the
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court.
that
alone
was
failed.
you've
got
to
have
a
special
assignment
bearing
petition
for
certiorari.
the
first
time
that
he
sought
to
make
this
issue
was
in
his
petition
for
reconsideration
that
he
filed
in
the
georgia
supreme
court
that
was
too
late
at
that
juncture.
he
al
--
he
mentioned
it
in
his
application
for
stay
to
this
court,
but
he
did
not
mention
it
in
his
petition
for
certiorari.
under
rule
23,
i
believe
it
can't
be
considered
for
that
reason.
now,
he
goes
on
to
say
that
he
was
prevented
from
raising
by
certain
amendments
that
were
filed
to
the
pleadings,
and
the
primary
thrust
of
his
argument
there
is
that
the
petition
was
amended
to
make
it
clear
that
if
he
did
undertake
to
prove
truth,
that
he
would
be
held
in
con
--
direct
contempt
in
that
respect.
that's
not
true.
this
amendment
that
was
filed
was
filed
after
a
hearing
on
demurrers
when,
for
the
first
time,
the
demurrers
of
the
petitioner
were
filed
in
which
he
said
that
the
petition
is
fatal
because
it
fails
to
allege
that
this
conduct
create
a
clear
and
eminent
danger.
subsequent
to
that,
the
court
granted
an
extension
of
time
for
amendment.
this
amendment
was
filed
five
days
later,
on
august
the
10th,
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
this
--
what
the
solicitor
apparently
feared
might
be
a
defect
in
his
petition.
he
amended
it
by
setting
out
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
making
of
the
utterances.
then,
he
concluded
in
this
paragraph
with
the
language
that's
narrowed
out
upon
his
foreclosing
the
issue
of
truth
by
saying
that
the
making
of
these
utterances
under
these
circumstances,
in
effect,
was
in
it
of
itself
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
administration
of
justice.
so,
we
say
that
he
has
not
been
foreclosed
from
making
this
issue
as
a
defese.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
on
it
solely
as
a
question
of
pleading
and
if
he
had
actually
made
it,
his
offer
of
proof
might
have
failed
for
a
number
of
reasons
and
the
issue
would
not
be
here
in
any
event.
and,
we
think
that
he's
trying
to
inject
into
this
case
a
hypothetical
issue
that
has
not
been
presented
or
decided
below.
