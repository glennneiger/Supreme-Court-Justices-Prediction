may
i
ask
you
to
follow
up
justice
brennan's
question?
what
other
grounds
that
disbars
him
under
the
laws
in
georgia?
justice
hugo

black
how
was
he
barred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
the
added
counts.
justice
hugo

black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

suppose
a
member
of
the
grand
jury
hadn't
accepted
that

(voice

would
that
have
been

yes,
if
he

black
yes,
either
way.
justice

(inaudible)
justice

do
you
know
whether
or
not,
in
georgia,
the
grand

is
the
most
(inaudible)
what
other
grand
juror
say,
what
they
actually
know,
have
they
done
away
with
that
old
common
law
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said
outside.
i
didn't
intend
to
use
or
to
draw
the
test
if
we
may
have
to
formulate
when
the
case
is
over.
i
was
simply
asking
you
the
fact
that
the
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
depends
on
what
the
court
holds
as
to
that
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
what
members
of
the
court
can
hold
it,
one
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
does
that
mean
that
the
state
concludes
that
what
he
is
charged
does
not
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
had
any
relevance
to
the
conviction
that
--
to
the
formulation
of
the
law
based
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
later
case
that
was
referred
after
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
on
page
65?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
before
the
claim
(inaudible)
was
here,
this
charge
does
not
reflect
on
the
judgment
of
that
motion.
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
be
contempt
in
georgia
for
a
man
who
wanted
the
grand
jury
to
investigate
an
alleged
crime
to
write
them
a
letter
telling
them
about
it
or
is
that
customarily
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
that
distinction
would
be
enough
to
draw
a
difference
on
whether
it
is
in
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
back
in
the
members
in
the
courthouse
who
maybe
have
a
job.
justice

black
frequently,
the
men
who
hold
a
political
job
are
the
very
ones
who
make
public
statements
about
political
matters.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
lawyer
makes
this
outside
the
court
or
inside
the
court.
would
it
make
any
difference
where
the
--
judging
him
guilty
of
contempt
whether
he's
inside
the
court
or
outside
the
court,
unless
he
had
some
way
inside
the
court
actually
interrupt
the
court
proceedings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
issued
a
state
--
he
just
issued
a
statement
from
the
courtroom,
public
on
the
outside.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
on
whether
or
not
it
was
contempt
where
the
statement
came
from,
if
it
was
a
statement
issued
to
the
public.
i'm
not
talking
now
about
this
order
or
the
motion
or
something
actually
inside
the
courtroom.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
you
think
it
would
make
any
difference
if
wood,
here,
a
sheriff,
was
a
lawyer,
had
been
running
against
the
judge
at
that
time
and
had
made
the
exact
remarks
he
made
in
a
campaign
speech
against
the
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
precise
--
statements
to
be
made
in
a
campaign
against
the
judge
and
in
the
campaign
they
have
mentioned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
made
it
by
the
same
time
while
he's
a
candidate,
running
together.
giving
as
an
example
why
this
judge
is
not
fit
to
be
a
judge
in
his
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
it
could
be
cited
and
convicted
for
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it?
why
do
you
say
that?
it
might
be
that
he
had
a
view
of
the
public
servant
citizens.
he
wanted
to
call
attention
to
things
that
he
thought
were
injurious
to
the
public.
certainly,
that
would
be
one
argument,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
if
he
then
saw
that
the
law
was
being
flagrantly
used
or
thought
he
saw
it's
flagrantly
used
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
about
and
brought
in
judgment
for
a
large
number
of
people,
he
commented
on
that
publicly
in
which
you
couldn't
draw
an
inference
that
maybe
he
did
it
because
he
was
a
public
servant
citizen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
fact
that
he
was
a
candidate,
do
you
think
that
will
make
it
worse?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
fact
that
he
was
a
candidate
against
him,
do
you
think
it
would
be
worse
for
him
to
point
out
what
he
thought
was
the
judge's
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
are
you
agreeing
to
--
i
understood
you'd
agree
to
some
question
or
to
some
suggestion
or
comment
that
was
made
to
the
effect
that
it
will
make
it
worse
for
him
to
make
a
statement
about
the
judge
if
he
was
a
candidate
for
judge.
