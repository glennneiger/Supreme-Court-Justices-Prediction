justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
kramer,
perhaps
you've
already
said
something
and
i
wasn't
attentative.
was
there
any
indication
that
these
remarks
of
the
judge
in
any
way
implicated
the
sheriff?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
(voice
overlap)
bad
name
or
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
term
of
the
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kramer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
mr.
wood
also
a
lawyer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
the
georgia
bar?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
he
practicing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
does
this
conviction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kramer,
is
there
anything
at
all
in
the
record
regarding
the
duties
of
a
sheriff
in
georgia
in
relation
to
the
courts
and
the
county
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
that
--
perhaps
i
better
ask
you
a
question,
was
the
support
for
this
holding,
in
part,
based
upon
the
fact
that,
as
sheriff,
he
was
an
officer
of
the
superior
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
isn't
there
something
in
the
supreme
court
opinion?
it's
been
a
while
since
i've
read
it
as
to
that
effect
though
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
getting
at
is
whether
the
support
from
the
conviction
rests
at
all
on
his
being
sheriff
or
would
this
have
happened
if
he'd
just
been
a
plain
citizen
and
not
a
sheriff.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
were
these
judges
running
for
reelection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
in
that
particular
primary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
know
whether
any
of
these
judges
were
then
running.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kramer,
i
asked
you
earlier
whether
the
supreme
court
had
rested
at
all
on
the
fact
that
he
was
sheriff.
at
page
34
of
their
opinion,
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
opinion
seems
to
be
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
34
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
perhaps
the
opinion
is
in
the
record
but
i
have
it
here
on
appended
to
the
decision.
those
last
several
lines
and
all
these
carried
on
by
the
sheriff,
an
officer
of
the
law
and
of
the
court,
at
times
during
which
the
grand
jury
properly
had
before
it
the
consideration
of
charge
of
court.
we
can
only
conclude
that
the
sheriff's
intent
for
his
actions
constitute
contempt.
that's
what
i
have
reference
to
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
affirming
to
the
contempt
conviction
as
part
at
least
by
the
supreme
court
rested
on
that
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
might
be
significant
as
the
case
is
before
us
whether
they
rested
this
on
the
fact
that
as
sheriff
and
officer
of
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
that
make
it
a
nonfederal
ground?
i
don't
follow.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
then
would
remove
the
federal
constitutional
question
he
raised?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
it
still
leave
any
federal
constitutional
question
even
if
this
was
a
disciplinary
matter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
had
--
wasn't
sawyer,
i
forgotten
that.
i
should
remember
but
i
don't.
sawyer
was
a
lawyer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
made
a
speech?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
reversed
a
contempt
conviction
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
we'd
still
have
a
constitutional
question
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
get
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
now
seems
to
run
possibly
for
the
public.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
from
the
opinion,
i
thought
it
was
not.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
what?
i'm
sorry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
group?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
leverett,
i
gather,
you
think
our
decision
in
sawyer
has
no
relevancy
to
our
problem
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
finding
as
to
this
or
any,
rather,
statement
of
the
--
to
that
effect
in
the
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
a
common
practice,
you
say,
in
georgia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
used
to
charge
grand
jury
as
a
state
judge
and
it
was
not
an
uncommon
practice
of
mine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
used
to
have
them
all
mimeographed.
