(inaudible)

had
stated
(inaudible)
that
everything
that
he
just
said
was
true
(inaudible).
chief

where
does
that
appear
in

would
that
be

(inaudible)
for
further
evidence
to
show
that
the
purpose
of
issue
(inaudible)
was
simply
to
face
the
general
public
on
what
(inaudible)
verily
and
sincerely
believed
the
other
side
of
the
issue
created
by
the
charge
of
the
grand
jury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
before
that
when
it
says
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leverett,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leverett,
do
you
make
any
distinction
between
this
case
and
a
case
where
a
client
or
his
lawyer
makes
a
statement
that
what
is
under
investigation
that
this
is
merely
political
persecution?
we
read
of
that
daily
--
almost
daily
in
the
newspapers
whenever
there's
anything
that
involves
political
situation.
the
first
thing
they
said
is
that
its
political
persecution.
now,
is
that
any
different
from
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
maybe
the
--
maybe
it
was
--
would
be
of
his
partner
or
his
family
or
someone,
some
group
that
he
belonged
to.
would
there
be
any
difference
between
that
and
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
noticed
here
that,
in
the
response,
the
petitioner
says
that
before
the
judge
gave
his
charge
in
this
case
that
he
summoned
all
of
the
news
media
to
the
courthouse
and
then,
as
soon
as
the
charge
was
given,
he
distributed
the
--
he
had
distributed
copies
to
all
of
the
newspapers
and
that
the
petitioner
was
merely
answering
in
exactly
the
same
way,
publicizing
his
own
side
of
the
case
the
same
way
the
judge
had
done
his.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
way
that
in
which
the
judge
do
it
have
anything
to
do
with
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
person?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
is
there
anything
in
your
law
which
says
that's
the
only
way
that
a
person
can
bring
any
information
to
the
grand
jury
is
through
the
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
--
in
georgia,
is
it
illegal
for
a
citizen
to
personally
bring
information
to
the
attention
of
the
grand
jury
that
he
consider
it
should
be
investigated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
--
the
reason
i
asked
you
is
because,
in
some
states,
it
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
is
not
to
this
--
it's
--
it's
a
common
practice
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
citizens
to
bring
information
to
the
grand
jury.
in
fact,
they're
--
they're
instructed
that
they
should
take
cognizance
of
any
complaints
of
that
kind
to
come
to
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
--
in
some
states,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
differentiation
between
the
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
did
ask
to
testify?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
he
did
testify?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leverett,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
conclusion
if
--
if
mr.
wood,
instead
of
being
the
sheriff,
had
been
a
reporter
or
the
auditor
who
are
in
no
sense
--
who
could
in
no
sense
become
officers
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
it
changes
the
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
it
says
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
respondent
shows
that
he
was
directly
interested.
this

respondent
shows
that
he
was
directly
interested
in
the
outcome
of
said
election
not
only
as
a
private
citizen,
but
also
as
one
who
was
an
announced
candidate
for
public
office
in
the
general
election
to
be
held
in
november
1960.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
was
a
primary
for
that
election.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then,
he
goes
on
to
say
that
respondent
felt
and
believed
that
the
language
which
was
employed
in
the
charge
to
the
grand
jury
was
of
such
a
nature
that
it
tended
to
create
or
emphasize
issues
likely
to
have
a
drastic
impact
for
the
outcomes
and
democratic
primary.
so,
wouldn't
that
put
it
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
hypothetical
that
justice
black
asked
you
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kramer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
