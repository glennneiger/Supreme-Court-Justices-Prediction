what
page
is
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
grant
that
is
so
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
this
exact
situation
that
there
is
minus
one
factor,
namely
that
what
the
charge
had
been
was
improper
alleged
duty
of
bloc
voting
without
reference
to
negroes.
what
would
your
position
be
as
to
the
validity
of
this
conviction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
the
essence
of
your
position
is
that
this
is
a
racial
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that
statute,
mr.
kramer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
i
understand.
(voice
overlap)
yes,
i
have
the
brief
in
my
possession.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
sent
to
the
grand
jury.
justice
john
m.
harlan
wasn't
the
communication
sent
to
the
grand
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
blue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
think
that
conviction
of
count
2
would've
been
sustainable?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
a
lawyer
instead
of
the
sheriff
that's
involved
here,
a
lawyer
whose
client
was
being
subject
to
â€“
was
being
investigated
by
the
grand
jury,
had
issued
this
press
release,
do
you
think
he
would've
been
subject
to
discipline?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
lawyer
knows
that
his
client
is
involved
in
the
grand
jury
investigation
of
this
alleged
bloc
voting
and
he
issued
these
press
releases,
would
he
be
subject
to
discipline?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
one
thing
bothers
me.
how
do
you
reconcile
your
state
court's
decision
as
to
count
two
which
has
gone
unsubstantiated
because
no
clear
and
present
danger
has
been
shown
handing
this
letter
of
communication
to
the
grand
jury
foreman?
was
its
finding
that
the
--
there
was
a
clear
and
present
danger
in
the
other
two?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
know,
but
you're
defending
the
counts
1
and
2,
aren't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
framework
of
bridges,
etcetera.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
i
am
putting
to
you
is
that,
if
there
was
no
clear
and
present
danger
as
your
state
court
found
involved
in
the
count
2
was
reversed,
what
remains
to
be
said
in
defense
of
the
holding
if
there
was
a
clear
and
present
danger
in
respect
to
the
other
two
counts
in
which
you
prevail?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
would
think
what?
