justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
represent
him
in
the
trial
court,
mr.
shea?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
arens,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
had
a
lawyer,
though.
justice
john
m.
harlan
two
years?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
go
back
to
something
you
said
earlier?
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
it.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
is
no
civil
commitment
proceeding
possible
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
there
is
a
criminal
charge
pending
against
a
man.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
does
that
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
mean
that
in
a
case
where
a
man
has
been
convicted,
no
plea
of
insanity,
no
suggestion
of
insanity,
he
is
committed
to
prison.
he
then
becomes
insane
in
prison
during
the
service
of
his
sentence.
is
there
no
power
of
the
warden
to
institute
some
kind
of
a
proceeding
to
transfer
him
to
an
insane
asylum?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
the
hospital
would
have
to
release
him
after
the
term
of
his
sentence
even
though
he
continues
to
be
insane?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
arens,
what
would've
been
your
position,
your
constitutional
position,
had
there
been
a
plea
of
insanity
imposed
here
and
the
same
procedure
followed
under
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
no.
i
meant
supposing
he
had
voluntarily
entered
a
plea
or
his
counsel
had
(inaudible)--
a
plea
of
in
--
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
then
the
court
had
held
him
not
guilty
by
a
reason
of
insanity
and
that
then
follow
the
procedure
under
the
statute,
would
you
have
a
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
would
that
have
been
a
constitutional
proceeding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
your
--
your
basic
constitutional
position
as
i
understand
it
from
your
colloquy
with
justice
brennan
is
that
he
was
committed
to
st.
elizabeths
without
any
determination
of
insanity.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
had
there
been
a
voluntary
plea
of
not
guilty
by
a
reason
of
insanity
and
an
acquittal
by
that
reason,
would
that
have
amounted
to
a
finding
that
he
was
insane?
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
reasonable
doubt,
exactly.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
i
am
trying
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is
the
reach
of
your
constitutional
position.
is
it
that
even
under
the
hypothetical
case
that
i
put
that
that
would
render
the
application
of
the
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or,
is
your
position
limited
to
the
situation
where
there
has
been
no
voluntary
plea
of
insanity
imposed
and
one
simply
entered
by
the
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
--
i
would
think
that
you
could've
given
the
judge
an
easier
route,
if
i
understand
the
statute
correctly,
namely
to
accept
his
plea,
send
him
to
st.
elizabeths,
alert
the
warden,
the
warden
finds
he's
presently
insane,
he
can
transfer
him
to
st.
elizabeths
to
the
expiration
of
his
sentence
and
then
a
civil
commitment
proceeding.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
the
court
have
done
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
why
do
you
have
to
go
through
this
other
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
a
much
more
direct
way
of
reaching
the
problem
that
you're
complaining
about
as
going
through
the
mechanics
of
dismissing
a
criminal
proceeding
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
undismissable?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
find
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
that
would
prevent
a
reading
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
only
in
a
situation
where
there
had
been
a
defense
of
insanity
interposed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
you
reading
from?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
durham
case
the
mode
of
power
behind
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
put
a
question
to
you,
this
concession
which
perhaps
has
been
answered
before
the
white
light
or
red
light
goes
on.
bearing
in
mind
that
our
duty
is
to
construe
this
statute
if
we
can
avoid
constitutional
question
on
the
basis
of
our
constitutional
evidence,
i
wish
you
would
explain
to
me
what
the
insurmountable
obstacles
are
to
construing
the
statute
as
not
applied
or
as
applying
only
in
the
case
where
a
plea
of
insanity
has
been
imposed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
been
interposed
by
the
defendant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
literally,
i
agree
with
you.
you
don't
have
to
take
time
on
that,
but
are
we
excluded
from
reading
the
statute
in
a
way
to
avoid
constitutional
questions
by
--
is
this
statute
so
inconsistent,
so
impermissible,
so
inconsistent
that
instruction
is
impermissible?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
if
there
was
a
gap
construing
the
statute,
as
i
suggest
that
it
might
be
construed,
if
there
was
a
gap
in
fulfilling
--
left
a
gap
in
fulfilling
the
congressional
purpose,
i
would
say
that
was
impermissible.
but,
as
i
understand
the
type
of
operation
of
this,
if
the
statute
was
construed
as
i'm
now
hypothesizing
and
the
man
were
sent
to
saint
elizabeths
and
the
superintendent
looked
him
over
and
said
“well,
this
no
--
man
is
no
longer
insane.
he
has
recovered.”
it
would
be
his
duty
to
release
him.
now,
if
the
judge,
faced
with
that
kind
of
a
limited
construction
of
the
statute,
said
“well,
alright,
there's
been
no
plea
of
insanity
here
but
i've
looked
at
this
man
and
he
seems
to
be
very
insane
and
i
will
send
him
to
prison,
as
i
have
to
do,
and
tip
off
the
warden.
he
better
take
a
look
at
him”
and,
the
warden
sends
him
over
to
saint
elizabeths
for
examination
and
saint
elizabeths
said
“we
believe
that
the
man
is
not
insane
at
the
moment”
and
out
he
goes.
what's
the
difference
between
the
two
things
as
a
practical
result?
what
gap
is
left
in
the
administration
of
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
hypothesizing
in
both
instances
that
the
man
--
the
only
justification
that
under
either
procedure
the
war
--
the
--
saint
elizabeths
who
have
obtained
with
or
above
the
sentence
would
be
if
he
is
found
then
un-recovered
from
his
insanity
both
instances
if
they
found
him
sane
at
the
time,
even
though
insane
at
the
time
of
his
--
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense
or
would
it
be
duty
to
release?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
talking
before
the
sentence
expired.
justice
john
m.
harlan
exactly.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
this
gap?
