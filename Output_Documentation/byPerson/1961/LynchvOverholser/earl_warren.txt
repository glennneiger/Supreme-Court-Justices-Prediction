mr.
shea.
mr.
arens,
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
start
--
would
you
start
again
with
those
facts
please,
the
procedural
facts
so
we
can
have
them
all
in
mind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
arens
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
arens,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
when
court
counsel
was
appointed
then
the
defendant
came
into
court
and
then
asked
permission
to
change
his
plea
from
not
guilty
to
guilty,
was
it
necessary
for
the
court
then
to
proceed
with
the
trial
or
did
the
court
have
the
power
if
it
desired
to
do
so,
to
direct
that
a
civil
proceeding
be
initiated
to
determine
his
sanity
if
the
court
believed
that
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
he
actually
was
competent
to
proceed
with
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
it
have
to
dismiss
the
charges?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
must
be
no
criminal
charge
pending
if
a
civil
proceeding
is
to
be
conducted,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
arens,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
when
the
court
refused
to
accept
the
defendant's
plea
of
guilty,
was
there
any
statement
on
his
part
that
the
reason
he
was
not
doing
it
was
because
he
felt
this
man
was
more
likely
to
be
insane
than
guilty
and
that
therefore
he
was
offering
the
defense
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
interpose?
did
the
judge
interpose
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
the
minutes
of
the
court
show
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
am
not
questioning
that.
i'm
not
questioning
that
at
all
but
i
suppose
the
minutes
of
the
court
will
show
that
the
defense
--
the
defendant
once
pled
not
guilty
and
then
that
he
offered
to
plead
guilty
and
was
denied
that
opportunity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
shown.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
there
anything
in
addition
to
that
to
show
that
the
court
itself
interposed
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
for
this
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
arens,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
is
there
not
another
alternative?
could
not
the
judge
before
he
placed
him
on
trial
at
the
suggestion
of
the
prosecution
or
the
hospital
or
anybody
else
have
dismissed
this
criminal
case
against
him
and
then
had
a
civil
proceeding
to
determine
his
sanity
without
having
to
put
him
in
jeopardy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
after
the
civil
proceeding
was
over,
if
he
was
found
to
be
sane
then
they
could've
charged
him
again
with
the
same
crime,
tried
him,
and
convicted
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
government
--
did
the
government
offer
this
proof
of
insanity
in
its
case
in
chief
or
in
rebuttal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
hospital
agrees
with
you
to
some
extent
at
least,
did
it
not?
didn't
they
make
a
differentiation
between
his
mental
condition
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense
and
as
of
the
time
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
say
that
he
had
improve
greatly
and
that
he
was
then
able
to
understand
his
surroundings
and
to
cooperate
with
counsel
in
the
conduct
of
his
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
after
all
we're
not
trying
him
under
english
procedure,
are
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
referring
back
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
stewart
about
whether
this
case
might
more
properly
be
here
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
release
him
because
of
his
penal
--
present
mental
condition,
would
you
be
in
any
better
position
in
that
kind
of
a
proceeding
to
raise
these
questions
that
you
are
now
raising
here
than
you
are
in
this
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
point
mr.
arens
is
this.
could
you
in
such
a
proceeding
raise
these
procedural
questions
as
to
his
commitment
to
the
institution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
believe
you
could,
so
if
you
can't
raise
it
in
this
kind
of
a
proceeding,
you
couldn't
raise
it
in
any
proceeding,
could
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
arens,
we've
taken
so
much
of
your
time
in
argument
that
i'm
(inaudible)
answering
--
passing
you
questions
that
i'm
going
to
give
you
five
more
minutes
in
rebuttal
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
which
you
may
be
able
to
sum
up
your
argument.
mr.
marshall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marshall,
who
made
--
who
made
the
decision
that
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marshall,
from
the
standpoint
of
procedural
due
process
finding
the
evidence
here
(inaudible),
when
does
the
record
show
that
he
first
had
not
been
(inaudible)
for
his
sanity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
on
the
day
of
the
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
the
trial
judge
prejudged
him
before
the
he
got
to
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marshall,
are
you
sure
(inaudible)
the
only
--
the
only
thing
that
got
to
my
mind
is,
is
the
procedure
that
he'd
gotten.
the
one
that
should
and
can
be
followed
in
the
federal
cases
in
order
to
deprive
the
man
(inaudible)
he
had
the
burden
of
proving
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
(inaudible)
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
in
this
case
have
accomplished
his
purpose
if
he
had
said
that
this
is
probably
a
minor
offense.
to
me
(inaudible),
he's
mentally
ill.
i'm
not
going
to
try
him
this
time
for
this
crime.
we'll
dismiss
this
proceeding
and
i'll
instruct
(inaudible)
simple
insanity
proceeding
against
him.
and
then,
if
on
that
jury,
he
was
found
to
be
not
mentally
ill,
then
the
prosecution
who
will
give
the
charge
for
this
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
judge
had
offered
a
dismissal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
mr.
marshall
(inaudible)
and
he's
only
charged
with
a
misdemeanor,
shouldn't
either
the
court
or
the
prosecution
notify
at
the
trial
it
is
not
going
to
contend
his
guilt
but
only
the
fact
that
he
is
insane,
thus,
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
prepare
his
defense
to
get
the
witnesses,
that
he
needs
to
get
the
psychiatrist
that
he
needs,
and
then
(inaudible)
but
the
prosecution
couldn't
get
to
court
in
the
abnormal
way.
we
must
concede
that
it's
abnormal
for
the
prosecution
to
offer
evidence
in
sanctity
of
the
penalty
in
this
case
in
chief.
wouldn't
the
offense,
in
the
nature
of
the
prosecution,
given
that
notice
of
(inaudible)
prepare
if
he
wanted
to
contest
the
question
of
his
insanity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
what
(inaudible)
if
the
petitioner
did
prevail
in
this
case
and
which
position
he
was
released
from
custody
to
saint
elizabeths
hospital
from
the
authorities
that
the
hospital
thought
that
he
was
still
insane.
could
they
then
initiate
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marshall,
is
it
making
any
difference
at
all
under
the
presentation
of
the
court
of
appeals
had
put
on
this
statute
whether
the
trial
is
two
months
or
two
years
after
the
commission
of
the
offense
because,
as
i
understood
you
to
say
a
little
earlier,
the
finding
of
the
court
is
not
(inaudible)
at
the
time
of
trial.
the
finding
is
what
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense.
so,
no
matter
how
long
after
the
offense,
the
evidence
can
still
be
insane
or
the
finding
insane
as
to
what
his
mental
condition
was
at
that
moment.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marshall,
if
we
were
--
if
were
to
hold
in
this
case
that
the
statute
itself
would
require
(inaudible)
by
insanity
was
constituted
but
that
the
rights
of
this
particular
defendant
had
been
violated
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
but
you're
representing
this
man
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
if
these
two
affidavits
before
him
as
to
the
competency
of
the
defendant,
the
judge
would've
said,
could
he
not,
“i'm
going
to
determine
whether
in
my
own
judgment
this
man
is
competent
to
stand
trial”
could
be
all
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
arens.
