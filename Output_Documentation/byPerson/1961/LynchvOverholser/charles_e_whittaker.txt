justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
to
say
that
the
court
--
excuse
me,
excuse
me,
i
think
you
were
talking
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
to
say
that
the
court
may
sentence
a
person
whom
the
evidence
shows
to
have
been
of
unsound
mind
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
mr.
arens,
are
you
arguing
that
the
government
used
this
criminal
leads
as
the
substitute
for
or
to
debate
the
civil
process
for
examining
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
arens,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
you,
but
did
you
say
that
a
plea
of
not
guilty
under
the
law
of
the
district
of
columbia
embraces
a
defense
of
insanity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
a
plea
of
not
guilty
here
was
in
fact
a
plea
of
not
guilty
for
any
cause
including
insanity.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
one
more
question
please.
i
understood
you
a
while
ago
to
say
that
the
trial
judge
might
have
dismissed
this
proceeding.
how
could
he
have
done
that
in
the
absence
of
evidence
showing
illegal
irresponsibility
for
the
client?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

arens
