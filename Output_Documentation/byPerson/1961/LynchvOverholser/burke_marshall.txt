mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
a
number
of
issues
that
are
raised
in
the
brief
by
mr.
arens'
argument.
i
would
like
to
separate
them
into
two
categories
because
i
think
that
they
will
be
easier
to
deal
with
in
that
fashion.
one
category
has
to
do
with
the
trial
court's
conduct,
what
the
chief
justice
just
referred
to
as
the
claimed
procedural
irregularities
in
the
case.
these
issues
have
been
put
by
mr.
arens
largely
in
constitutional
terms.
but
i
think
that
the
fact
is
that
many
or
most
of
them
are
not
necessarily
constitutional,
that
is
that
the
court
could
deal
with
them
in
the
matter
of
administering
federal
judicial
system
and
the
system
of
justice
in
the
federal
courts
without
giving
them
a
constitutional
dimension.
the
other
issues
have
to
do
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
these
are
necessarily
constitutional.
they
depend
--
they
turn
on
the
question
of
whether
congress
acted
so
irrationally
in
passing
the
mandatory
commitment
statute
in
the
district
that
the
statute
has
to
be
declared
unconstitutional
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
turning
first
to
the
procedural
side
of
the
case,
i
think
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
there
is
no
question
but
that
this
procedure
against
mr.
lynch
started
with
the
commission
of
two
criminal
acts.
there
is
--
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
should
say
two
acts
which
were
criminal
unless
he
was
not
responsible
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
criminal
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
burke
marshall
they
are
two
acts
prohibited
by
a
criminal
statute,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
he
was
criminally
responsible
for
them.
i
meant
that
they
did
not
start
with
him
sitting
in
his
home
and
being
brought
in
to
a
--
by
the
government.
they
started
with
a
commission
of
an
act
which
is
prohibited
by
a
criminal
statute
and
the
question
was
what
consequences
resulted
from
that.
the
other
fact
is
that
there
is
no
question
on
this
record
as
to
the
--
mr.
lynch's
insanity
at
the
time
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
burke
marshall
to
clear
up
this
point
of
the
way
that
i
worded
my
statement
about
the
commission
of
a
crime,
i
think
that
on
the
record,
there
is
no
challenge
to
the
fact
that
the
government
proved
in
this
trial
all
the
material
elements
of
the
criminal
acts
except
sanity
and
that's
all
that
i
meant
is
that
there's
no
question
but
that
it
started
with
the
commission
of
acts
which
would
be
criminal
were
not
it
for
depe
--
for
the
defendant's
insanity.
mr.
burke
marshall
there
is
no
record,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
there
is
a
presumption
of
regularity
and,
as
i
say,
the
--
there
is
no
challenge
to
it.
mr.
burke
marshall
there
is
no
transcript
of
the
trial
proceedings.
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
there
was
no
suggestion
by
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
i
do
not
think
that,
in
this
particular
case,
there's
any
dispute
as
to
what
happened
in
the
municipal
court,
any
basic
dispute.
the
record
does
show
that
when
the
case
came
on
to
trial
before
the
chief
judge
of
the
municipal
court,
he
had
before
him
two
reports
from
the
hospital
on
the
mental
condition
of
mr.
lynch.
one
was
about
three
weeks
old.
that
one
said
that,
at
that
time,
mr.
lynch
was
incompetent,
unable
to
understand
the
proceedings
against
him,
unable
to
assist
counsel,
and
that
that
report
recommended
commitment
and
further
treatment
at
the
time.
the
other
report
was
dated
just
the
day
before
the
trial.
that
said
that
he
had
made
improvement.
that
he
was
now
able
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charge
and
to
assist
counsel,
but
that
at
the
time
the
crimes
were
committed,
he
had
been
suffering
from
a
mental
disease,
which
the
report
diagnosed
as
a
manic
depressive
psychosis,
which
is
a
very
serious
mental
disease
and
that,
in
the
opinion
of
the
psychiatrist
who
wrote
the
report,
the
crimes
or
the
criminal
acts
had
been
a
product
of
that
mental
disease.
those
two
reports
were
before
the
judge.
mr.
burke
marshall
yes,
they
are,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
--
the
record
simply
doesn't
show
what
happened
on
that
point.
in
fact,
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
the
court,
on
its
own
motion,
called
the
psy
--
psychiatrist
or
whether
the
government
called
him
or
even
whether
or
not
it
was
on
the
case
on
--
in
chief.
it
does
show
--
all
that
it
shows
is
that
there
were
these
two
reports
before
the
judge
and
that
it
was
in
the
context
of
those
two
reports
that
the
judge
rejected
the
plea
of
guilty
and
proceeded
to
trial.
mr.
burke
marshall
at
the
trial,
yes,
mr.--
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
burke
marshall
well
--
mr.
burke
marshall
but
the
--
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i'm
afraid
that
i
just
can't
answer
that
question
in
general
because
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
the
proceedings
before
the
municipal
court.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think
it
--
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
raises
a
problem
in
this
case
because
the
petitioner,
as
i
understand
this
case,
does
not
really
challenge
anything
that
went
on
in
the
municipal
court,
except
it
--
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
mr.
--
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
i
think
the
point
is
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
he
was
not
tried
on
a
question
of
sanity
or
insanity.
he
was
tried
for
the
commission
of
two
criminal
acts
and
in
that
trial
there
was
evidence
of
his
mental
condition
and
on
the
basis
--
mr.
burke
marshall
mental
condition
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crimes.
mr.
burke
marshall
yes
sir,
he
was
competent
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
judge
necessarily
had
to
find
that
before
he
put
him
to
trial.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
on
that
point,
of
course,
there
is
a
great
difference
between
being
competent
in
the
sense
of
being
triable,
of
being
able
to
understand
the
proceedings
and
being
under
the
district
of
columbia
rules
legally
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
responsible
criminally.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
that
i'd
better
clear
up
this
confusion.
the
--
mr.
arens
did
not
say
--
i
did
not
understand
him
to
say
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
alleges
that
lynch
was
or
was
not
competent
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
lynch,
on
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
does
not
allege
sanity
right
now.
there
is
no
claim
that
he
has
recovered
from
the
mental
disease
which
existed
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crimes,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
court
had,
in
order
to
make
this
commitment,
make
a
finding
at
the
trial
that
he
was
then
insane.
the
court
proceeded
under
the
statute
and
the
statute
operates
from
a
finding
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
once
that
finding
is
made
by
a
court
or
by
a
jury
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
under
the
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
commitment
follows
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
i
do
not
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
on
this
record
it
could
be
said
that
there
was
any
affirmative
evidence
of
sanity
at
all,
of
any
court
--
of
any
kind
at
any
point,
but
i
don't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
the
court
found
him
to
be
insane
at
the
time
of
his
trial
because
that
would
be
a
misstatement
of
what
the
court
did.
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
say
that.
the
--
under
the
davis
case
in
the
federal
system
and
under
the
tatum
case
in
the
district
of
columbia,
once
the
evidence
of
insanity
is
introduced,
put
in
issue
at
all,
either
by
the
government
or
by
the
defense,
then
there
is
a
burden
on
the
government
to
prove
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
that's
the
only
finding,
mr.
justice
brennan.
on
the
other
hand,
as
i
say
there
is
no
allegation
of
sanity
either
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense
or
at
the
time
of
trial
or
now.
he
does
not
on
this
record,
raise
the
question
of
insanity.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
believe
that
the
offenses
were
in
october
and
the
trial
was
in
december.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
i
think
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
i
think
the
--
mr.
burke
marshall
no
--
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
effect
of
the
finding
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
is
to
find
that
there
was
--
the
government
has
not
proved
his
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense.
it
is
not
an
affirmative
finding
under
the
statute
of
insanity.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
with
that
amendment,
i
think
that
your
statement
is
correct
that
the
carryover,
the
time
lag,
between
what
--
the
finding
that
the
court
did
make
as
to
mental
competence
was
from
october
which
was
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense
until
december.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
of
course,
unless
he
disappeared
or
something,
there
would
normally
not
be
a
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
first
knowledge,
i
suppose,
that
he
had
--
that
he
was
actually
going
to
try
--
trial
was
when
the
court
rejected
the
plea
of
guilty.
now,
that
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
on
the
day
of
trial,
mr.
chief
justice.
of
course,
i
would
not
accept
that
characterization
of
what
went
on.
the
trial
court
did
have
before
it,
when
it
was
faced
with
this
defendant
in
this
case,
it
did
have
before
it
these
two
psychiatric
reports
which
indicated
--
which
really
constituted
overwhelming,
i
think,
evidence
of
his
innocence
at
that
time.
the
psychiatric
reports
showed
that
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
psychiatrist
who
examined
him
that
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offenses,
he
was
the
victim
of
a
manic
depressive
psychosis
which
is
a
very
serious
mental
disease
in
any
terms
and
that,
as
a
result
of
that,
he
did
what
he
did
which
was
the
criminal
acts
and,
so
that,
it
was
in
that
context
that
that
was
the
situation
the
trial
judge
was
faced
with
and
--
mr.
burke
marshall
no.
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
mean
that
when
the
court
--
when
the
trial
judge
came
in
and
was
faced
with
this
change
in
plea
in
the
entrance
of
a
plea
of
guilty,
he
had
before
him
these
two
psychiatric
reports
and
the
psychiatric
reports
i
think,
as
i
say,
indicated
to
the
trial
judge
really
very,
very
strong
evidence
of
innocence,
of
innocence
of
the
crimes
with
which
this
man
was
charged.
so
that,
the
court
was
faced
with
a
position
of
having
to
accept,
if
he
did
what
the
defense
counsel
wanted
to
do
--
him
to
do,
accept
the
plea
of
guilty
under
situation
when
he
knew
that
the
man
who
was
pleading
guilty
was
not
in
fact
guilty
or
at
least,
mr.
chief
justice,
he
is
--
he
had
overwhelming
reason
to
believe
that
from
what
was
plainly
in
front
of
him
at
that
time.
i
think
that
it's
in
that
context
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
--
at
the
propriety
of
what
the
trial
judge
did.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
--
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
in
that
case.
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
either
at
the
trial
court
or,
even
more
importantly,
at
the
time
of
the
release
procedures
under
the
statute.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
statute
covers
all
kinds
of
crime.
i
mean,
the
mandatory
commitment
statute
of
the
district
of
columbia
covers
crimes
that
are
brought
--
are
charged
by
indictment
and
crimes
that
are
charged
by
information
and
crimes
that
are
brought
before
the
juvenile
court,
so
that
there
isn't
any
limitation
in
the
statute
based
upon
the
magnitude
of
the
crime,
but
we
are
dealing
with
a
series
of
procedures
that
starts
with
the
trial
judge.
now,
the
trial
judge,
in
considering
a
plea
of
guilty
in
the
municipal
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
has,
under
the
rules
of
that
court
an
area
of
discretion.
in
this
case,
with
the
evidence
before
him,
which
was
not
a
very
minor
mental
aberration
but
of
a
very
serious
mental
disease
and
with
the
crimes
before
him
--
that
were
before
him,
exercised
his
discretion
in
that
case
in
the
way
that
he
did.
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
tell
how
a
trial
judge
would
exercise
his
discretion
in
another
case.
and
--
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
no
that
course
of
action
was
not
opened
to
the
trial
judge.
mr.
burke
marshall
because
i
don't
think
that
the
trial
judge
has
the
authority
or
power
just
to
dismiss
a
criminal
proceeding
when
the
government
has
proof
that
the
man
did
it
--
did
the
act.
i
don't
think
that
that
was
a
course.
now
--
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't.
i
think
that
the
judge
has
to
proceed
to
trial
if
the
government
wants
to
bring
it
to
trial.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
i'm
not
acquainted
with
the
next
case,
mr.
justice.
[laughter]
maybe
that's
fortunate.
mr.
burke
marshall
well
--
mr.
burke
marshall
we
don't
have
a
burge's
law,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
this
case.
i
can
answer
the
question
in
terms
of
this
case.
i
can't
answer
it
in
terms
of
every
criminal
trial
in
the
district
of
columbia
because
i
don't
know,
it
may
vary.
but,
in
this
case,
the
psychiatrists
that
testified
were
all
clearly
independent
witnesses
in
the
sense
that
their
testimony
in
any
normal
case
would've
been
contrary
to
the
best
interest
of
the
prosecution.
they
testified
--
usually
if
the
government
calls
a
psychiatrist,
it
does
so
in
rebuttal
and
it
does
so
to
rebut
defense
testimony
of
other
psychiatrist
who
says
that
a
man
is
insane.
the
testimony
in
this
case,
though
it
is
not
in
the
record,
i
think,
presumably
must
be
of
all
had
been
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offenses.
mr.
burke
marshall
that,
i
think,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
a
necessarily
--
necessary
result
of
the
federal
system,
except
in
the
district
of
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
it's
--
the
district
of
columbia
is,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
is
a
peculiar
mixed
jurisdiction
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
and
the
matters
that
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case
are
matters
of
district
of
columbia
law
and
it's
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
believe
that,
normally,
it
is
the
practice
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
state
civil
authorities
to
--
for
a
commitment
proceeding,
but
there
is
no
--
nothing
under
the
statute
and
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
anything
constitutional
that
the
federal
government
could
do
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
believe
--
mr.
burke
marshall
i
believe,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
there
are
11
states
that
have
mandatory
commitment
statutes
that
are
like
this
and
the
british
statute
is
like
this.
there
are
other
statutes
where,
although
they
do
not
require
a
present
finding
of
insanity,
leave
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
some
discretion.
if
you
add
it
up,
the
states
which
have
either
an
inflexible
mandatory
commitment
law
or
a
commitment
law
which
does
not
in
by
its
terms,
require
a
present
hearing
and
finding
on
the
issue
of
insanity,
i
think
there
are
about
29
or
30
states
like
that.
as
i
say,
that's
the
british
practice.
before
this
statute
was
--
mr.
burke
marshall
where
there
is
a
finding
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
that
either
the
statute
requires
commitment
right
then
and
there,
as
does
this
statute
which
is
11
states,
or
it
permits
the
trial
judge
to
commit
him
without
any
intervening
hearing,
but
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
not
as
a
mandatory
matter,
as
is
true
under
this
statute.
that's
a
general
summary,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
may
be
minor
variations
in
it.
mr.
burke
marshall
there
are,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
some
that
require
a
full
hearing.
i
think
that's
only
three
states,
but
there
are
about
18
additional
states
which
require
some
kind
of
an
intervening
hearing.
i
think
that
in
this
case,
speaking
to
the
municipal
court's
discretion
and
his
exercise
of
discretion,
that
he
did
--
that
the
existence
of
the
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia
affected
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
in
that
he
did
have
a
statute
before
him.
the
statute
had
been
passed
by
congress
in
a
specific
situation
by
reason
of
the
developments
of
the
durham
rule.
the
intent
of
the
statute
to
apply
to
acquittals
by
reason
of
insanity
was
very
specific
and
i
think
that,
as
i
say,
in
exercising
his
discretion
under
the
rule,
he
did
have
to
take
into
account
this
congressional
intent
in
the
statutory
situation.
in
addition,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
in
a
way
remarkable
that
we
have
the
petitioner
and
we
have
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
here,
arguing
for
a
rigid
rule
of
law,
a
rigid
rule
of
law
that
would
require
a
trial
judge
faced
with
this
kind
of
a
situation
to
ignore
evidence
of
insanity,
which
is
evidence
of
innocence,
and
proceed
to
accept
a
plea
of
guilty.
in
fact,
the
cases
--
some
of
the
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia,
in
this
area,
have
suggested
that
that
--
it
would
be
an
abuse
by
the
trial
judge
to
accept
a
plea
of
guilty
under
the
--
those
circumstances,
that
failure
of
trial
counsel
to
raise
the
point
under
those
circumstances
would
be
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
burke
marshall
now,
i
am
speaking
--
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
duty
on
government
prosecution.
mr.
burke
marshall
but
--
mr.
burke
marshall
i
was
going
to
go
on
and
say
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
that
to
be
true
in
the
district
of
columbia
cases.
i
may
be
wrong
about
that,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
statement
to
that
effect,
but
i
must
say
that
i
think
it
would
be
unconscionable
on
the
part
of
the
government
not
to
bring
evidence
of
this
nature
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge.
we
are
talking
at
this
point
simply
of
his
discretion
in
doing
what
he
did.
thurman
arnold,
when
he
was
on
the
court
of
appeals
here,
said
that
it
offended
the
collective
conscience
of
our
society
to
impose
a
punishment
where
we
could
not
impose
blame.
if
this
rule
of
law
is
--
that
is
being
contended
for
were
to
operate
it
would
be
a
necessary
result
of
it.
the
trial
judges
would
not
have
discretion
but
would
be
required
by
this
court
to
accept
plea
of
guilty
and
to
impose
punishment
where
it
could
not
impose
blame
or
at
least
where
it
would
have
overwhelming
reason
to
believe
that
it
should
not
impose
blame.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
were
any
suggestion
here,
any
allegation,
that
the
defendant
had
been
in
--
had
been
prejudiced
by
this
or
if
the
--
his
lawyer
had
asked
for
a
continuance
at
the
time
that
the
re
--
plea
of
guilty
was
rejected,
i
think
that
maybe
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
might
have
reversed
if
the
trial
court
had
refused
to
grant
a
continuance,
but
this
came
up
in
a
context
where
the
man
had
been
confined
in
the
district
of
columbia
general
hospital
for
observation.
he
really
had
no
--
there
is
no
suggestion
at
all
that
he
hadn't
done
these
acts
that
were
defined
as
being
criminal
in
the
district
of
columbia
code
and
i
just
think
that
the
possible
prejudice
of
that
sort
is
not
presented
in
this
case
and,
as
i
say,
it
was
not
raised.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
that
raised
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
under
the
district
of
columbia
law
when
he
is
confined
in
a
hospital,
including
saint
elizabeths,
because
of
mental
illness,
that
the
superintendent
of
that
hospital
can
initiate
civil
commitment
proceedings.
mr.
burke
marshall
i'm
not
fully
acquainted
with
all
the
procedures
under
the
civil
commitment,
but
i
think
that
would
certainly
be
a
basic
and
maybe
the
relevant
difference
in
this
case.
mr.
burke
marshall
the
--
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
he
did
make
the
point
about
not
having
enough
time
to
prepare.
mr.
burke
marshall
but
i
don't
think
that
chief
--
judge
fahey's
basic
point
was
that
the
commitment
was
unlawful.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
he
states
the
opposite,
i
believe.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
--
if
it
were
solely
a
question
of
his
not
having
time
or
something,
i
believe
in
the
district,
he
could've
raised
that
question
by
appeal.
his
petition
for
habeas
--
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
if
we
pass
that
point
and
pass
the
peculiarity
of
the
question
of
time
and
whether
or
not
he
had
time
to
prepare
or
to
meet
the
government's
case
here,
i
think
we
are
straight
up
against
the
provisions
in
the
constitutionality
of
the
district
of
columbia
statute
of
section
301.
that
statute
does
provide
for
mandatory
commitment.
it
does
apply
to
anyone
who
has
been
acquitted
by
reason
of
insanity
on
any
charge
for
any
offense
in
the
district
of
columbia,
whether
by
indictment
or
by
information
or
in
the
juvenile
court.
the
basic
con
--
mr.
burke
marshall
on
its
face,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
irrespective
of
the
timeline
as
well.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
district
of
columbia
statute
is
really
in
two
parts,
one
part
dealing
with
the
commitment
procedures
and
the
other
part
with
release
procedures.
how
you
get
out
once
you're
in?
the
part
dealing
with
commitment
procedures
in
my
judgment
does
not
have
any
leeway
on
this
point.
it
is
a
mandatory
commitment
statute
and
it
applies
to
anyone
acquitted
by
reason
of
insanity,
and
i
don't
know
of
anything
in
either
the
language
of
the
statute
or
in
the
history
of
the
statute
that
the
court
could
rely
on
to
say
that
it
didn't
apply
to
everyone
acquitted
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
experience
under
this
statute,
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
case
where
it
has
proved
to
be
the
fact
that
someone
committed
under
the
statute
was
in
fact
not
insane
at
the
time
that
he
was
committed.
that
is,
the
experience
under
the
statute,
i
think,
has
been
such
that
there
has
never
been
an
instance
where
the
timeline
was
so
great.
and
you
can
see,
in
a
way,
why
that
would
be
so
because
under
normal
situations,
unless
the
defendant
can't
be
found,
he
would
be
brought
in
and
if
he's
incompetent
to
stand
trial
at
that
time,
he'd
be
submitted
to
the
hospital
for
treatment.
the
treatment
of
these
diseases
takes
an
appreciable
amount
of
time.
it
isn't
like
getting
over
something
with
a
defined
beginning
and
defined
end
like
measles.
the
time
that
it
takes
normally
in
order
to
make
improvement
requires
hospitalization
and
treatment.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
that
long
a
delay
unless
the
defendant
was,
in
the
meantime,
in
a
hospital
receiving
treatment
until
he
became
mentally
competent
to
stand
trial.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct
--
that
is
correct
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
but,
under
all
that
time,
he
would
be
under
the
treatment
of
doctors
and
the
doctors
during
all
that
time
would
be
faced
with
a
statutory
responsibility
of
informing
the
judge
--
informing
the
court
as
soon
as
he
became
competent
to
stand
trial.
the
hospital
is,
of
course,
very
crowded
and
the
staff
of
the
hospital
is
conscious
of
this
statutory
duty.
he
isn't
--
the
way
that
it
is
set
up,
i
think
that
it
is
not
--
it's
at
least
unlikely
that
he
would
sit
there
because
of
inertia
on
the
part
of
the
hospital
staff.
mr.
burke
marshall
but
my
point,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
i
don't
think
that
would
affect
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
concern
because
if
the
delay
was
by
that
reason,
it
would
all
the
time
be
delay
while
he
was
in
a
hospital
and
while
doctors
were
watching
him
to
see
if
he
became
competent
to
stand
trial,
so
that
the
delay
between
the
time
of
that
finding
and
the
trial
itself
would
be
very
short.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
it
is
possible,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
in
some
case
in
the
district
for
some
reason
or
another,
that
if
he
left
the
jurisdiction
that
there
might
be
a
substantial
period
of
time
between
the
commission
of
the
crime
and
the
trial
on
that
charge
and
--
mr.
burke
marshall
it
was
passed
in
1955.
the
durham
rule
was
--
was
handed
down
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
1954
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think
that
the
experience
under
the
statute,
as
i
know
of,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
was
relevant
to
your
question
which
was
--
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think
that
--
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
i
think
judgment
by
experience
in
this
instance,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
relevant
because
the
challenge
to
the
statute
--
this
part
of
the
statute
is
upon
the
basis
that
it
was
irrational,
irrational
for
congress
to
make
the
judgment.
mr.
burke
marshall
and,
i
would
--
i
do
not
have
them
firmly
in
my
head
but
i
think
there
must
have
been
--
mr.
burke
marshall
there
are
a
large
number
--
there
are
a
large
number
of
them.
i
would
--
there
are
over
200
or
300,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
they
all
appear
in
some
hearings
in
congress
last
year
and
i
can
get
you
that
figure.
i
can
get
you
a
figure.
mr.
burke
marshall
on
the
operation
of
the
statute
and
the
general
context
of
the
statute,
the
context
in
which
it
is
--
was
passed,
i
think
that
it
is
also
relevant
and
that
the
court
should
give
some
weight
to
the
fact
that
it
is
in
opposite
or
a
result,
a
consequence,
as
a
matter
of
legislative
history
of
the
durham
rule.
the
durham
rule,
the
direction
of
the
durham
rule,
the
movement
of
the
durham
rule
was
in
treating
mentally
ill
as
being
mentally
ill
and
not
as
being
insane.
i
think
that
that
movement
is
generally
accepted
as
having
been
a
good
one.
it
is
a
result,
one
consequence
of
that,
necessarily,
is
that
more
people
are
acquitted
by
a
reason
of
insanity
under
the
district
of
columbia
than
they
would
be
under
the
tests
of
insanity
or
criminal
responsibility
that
are
applied
in
other
jurisdictions,
and
another
consequence
of
it
is
that
the
consequence
of
having
been
tried
that
--
the
consequence
of
this
rule
of
criminal
administration
is
a
treatment
rather
than
imprisonment
and
it's
a
corollary
of
that
or
another
consequence
of
the
durham
rule
and
the
statute
that
followed
the
durham
rule
that
the
length
of
time
which
someone
might
spend
in
confinement
is
not
necessarily
related
to
the
--
to
the
magnitude
of
the
offense
with
which
he
is
charged.
as
i
say,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
necessary
and
inevitable
consequence
of
a
rule
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
permits
the
advance
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
by
the
use
of
psychiatrists,
by
the
recognition
that
insanity
and
responsibility
is
not
necessarily
related
to
specific
or
certain
mental
diseases.
and,
i
think
that
it
is
the
frustration
with
this
fact,
the
frustration
with
the
fact
that
the
treatment
for
someone
who
is
mentally
ill
is
not
necessarily
related
at
all
to
the
length
of
imprisonment
which
he
would
suffer
if
he
had
been
found
guilty.
it's
that
frustration
which
gives
rise
to
this
case.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
in
no
practical
way
would
it
be
injured.
i
think
it
would
injured
in
that
--
i
think
in
no
practical
way
that
would
be
injured,
i
think
that
it
would
be
sort
of
unrelated
to
the
contentions
advanced
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
agree
with
you
about
that
but
i
just,
as
i
say,
don't
think
that
it's
raised
in
this
case.
he
--
the
defendant,
if
he
had
asked
for
a
continuance,
if
he
had
asked
for
more
time,
if
he
had
--
if
he
now
even
claimed
that
he
could've
proved
sanity
at
that
time,
which
is
not
a
claim
that
he
makes
on
the
record,
if
any
of
those
things
were
true,
i
don't
think
this
case
would've
come
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
i
think
that
that
kind
of
error
and
i
think
it
might
have
been
an
abuse
of
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
not
to
grant
a
continuance,
but
the
trial
judge
was
not
asked
for
a
continuance.
mr.
burke
marshall
a
plea
of
insanity
has
been
imposed?
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
the
statute,
mr.
justice
harlan,
reads
as
follows.
it
says
when
any
person
tried
upon
an
indictment
or
information
--
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
best
i
can
say
--
the
best
way
i
can
answer
that
is
that
--
is
that
it
would
--
it
has
no
basis
at
all
in
the
statutory
language.
the
statutory
language
talks
about
people
who
are
acquitted
by
reason
of
insanity.
it
does
not
talk
about
it
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
defense
imposed
and
the
law
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
law
in
the
federal
system
at
that
time
was
that
the
issue
of
insanity
could
be
raised
by
evidence
introduced
by
either
side.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
principal
gap
that
would
be
left
in
the
procedure
that
you
suggested
is
that
the
time
for
his
treatment
in
the
hospital
would
necessarily
be
related
to
the
punishment,
the
length
of
punishment
for
the
offense
that
he's
been
cre
--
he
committed.
the
--
among
other
things
--
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
of
course,
that's
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
he
found
him
ins--
found
him
sane
at
the
time
that
the
sentence
would've
expired,
it's
his
duty
to
release
him
under
this
statute.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
it
is
a
duty
--
it
is
the
duty
of
the
superintendent
of
the
hospital
to
certify
him
as
ready
for
release
whether
--
if
he
has
a
99-year
sentence
and
he
recovers
in
9
months,
he
gets
released
under
the
statute.
mr.
burke
marshall
and,
i'm
afraid
i
haven't
grasped
your
question.
mr.
burke
marshall
the
gap
occurs,
mr.
justice
harlan,
as
to
prisoners
who
would
--
whose
term
had
not
expired.
if
--
if
the
court
handed
down
a
rule
of
law
which
would
forbid
a
--
yes,
sir?
mr.
burke
marshall
well
--
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
a
choice
that
would
leave
the
trial
judge
in
this
circumstance.
now,
if
the
trial
judge
accepted
the
plea
of
guilty,
he
could
do
what
mr.
justice
harlan
suggests,
and
that
is
that
he
could
sentence
him
and
then
suggest
to
the
warden
that
the
man
ought
to
be
looked
at
and,
perhaps,
sent
to
saint
elizabeths.
but,
if
he
did
that,
he
did
that,
he
would
be
finding
a
man
whom
the
government
and
the
court
and
defense
counsel,
all
knew
to
be
innocent
and
he
would
be
imposing
a
finding
of
guilty
and
imposing
a
sentence,
a
con
--
a
sentence
of
conviction
under
those
circumstances.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
proceeded
to
do
what
i
would
think
would
be
his
duty
as
a
judge
and
under
conscience,
which
would
be
to
take
in
the
evidence
of
insanity,
then
--
and
have
a
trial
and
not
accept
the
plea
of
guilty,
then
the
man
would
--
the
defendant
would
be
acquitted
on
the
grounds
of
insanity
and
there
would
be
no
commitment
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
would
be
applicable
to
the
case,
which
i
think
would
defeat
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
burke
marshall
well
--
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
i
think
a
very
few
of
them,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
there
was
an
implication
in
your
question
which
i
would
like
to
remove
and
that
is
that
you
said
i
believe
that
if
necessary
to
change
--
to
save
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
of
course,
i
do
not
think
such
a
construction
is
necessary
to
change
--
save
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
think
that
the
statute
is
a
rational
act
of
congress
in
equating
treatment
of
the
mentally
ill
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
suppose
that
he
could
have,
as
a
matter
of
procedure
and
power,
but
he
would've
been
doing
something
for
which
there
would
be
no
justification
in
fact.
i
do
not
think
anyone
contends,
starting
with
mr.
lynch
and
on
to
the
government
or
the
court
that
lynch
was
not
at
that
time
competent
to
stand
trial.
he
was
competent
to
stand
trial
in
that
he
understood
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
and
he
was
competent
to
talk
to
his
lawyer
and
tell
his
lawyer
what
had
happened.
the
--
that
is
very
different
from
not
--
from
being
responsible
in
the
criminal
law
sense.
