justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
no
transcript
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
--
the
point
is
that
there's
never
yet
been
an
affirmative
determination
that
he
is
insane,
whatever
that
means.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
did,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
--
that
he
did
not
request
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
far
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
mode
of
power
behind
making
it
mandatory.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
required,
that
i
gather,
to
the
discretion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
government
agree
with
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
do
say,
i
gather,
that
the
court
did
find
him
insane
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense
that
--
or
that
the
verdict
implies
an
affirmative
finding
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense.
do
you
say
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
all
that
we
actually
have
here
then,
indeed
we
have
no
finding
of
any
kind
on
this
record
that
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense,
he
was
in
fact
insane.
all
that
we
have
is
that
there
is
a
reasonable
doubt
of
his
sanity
which
is
implicit
in
the
verdict
and
also
is
all
that
we're
to
take
the
finding
of
the
judge
to
mean.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
isn't
true
that
that's
not
the
premise,
mr.
marshall,
as
i
understood
it.
the
premise
is
not
that
there
was
any
finding
of
insanity
in
october.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
marshall
had
just
said
that
there
it
is
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
marshall
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
goes
even
beyond
this,
doesn't
it?
do
i
correctly
understand
the
district
of
columbia
cases
to
say
that
if
the
prosecution
has
knowledge
of
facts
which
might
indicate
mental
disability
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
the
prosecution
is
bound
to
follow
that
contention
in
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
there
anything
in
any
of
the
district
of
columbia
cases
which
suggest
that
that
is
the
view?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact
here,
mr.
marshall,
but
for
the
fortuitous
circumstance
that
within
two
months,
the
psychiatrist
would
say
he
had
improved
after
he
had
been
confined
on
a
conclusion
that
he
was
not
competent
to
stand
on
trial,
he
might
still
have
been
there
and
not
been
brought
to
trial.
as
of
today,
nobody
knows
and
that
period
might
have
been
much
longer
than
two
months
that
have
been
factored
in.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
but
i
assume
there
must
be
some
instances
of
commitment
that
this
one
was
made
initially
because
they
felt
he
was
not
competent
to
stand
trial
where
a
long
period
of
treatment,
hospitalization
is
required
before
there
is
a
certification.
well,
now,
he
is
competent
to
stand
trial.
