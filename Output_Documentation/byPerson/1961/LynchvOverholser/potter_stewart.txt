justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
--
statute
provides
so
far
as
commitment
for
observation
at
the
time
of
arraignment?
justice
potter
stewart
when
he
entered
his
plea
of
not
guilty,
did
he
have
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
statute
leave
room
for
challenge
of
the
judge's
action?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
talking
now
about
this
preliminary
commitment
for
observation
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
an
arraignment.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
statute
gives
the
judge
power
to
do
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
far
as
--
upon
observation.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
saying
this
to
shock
us?
does
that
seem
shocking
to
you?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
those
are
the
terms
of
the
statute,
aren't
they?
they're
not
confined
to
the
nature
or
magnitude
or
gravity
of
the
crime
that
the
person
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
charged
at
all.
they
are
directed
to
the
person's
condition
not
to
the
magnitude
of
the
offense
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
why
do
you
refer
to
that
as
a
disaster?
it's
a
sad
condition,
but
assuming
that
this
person
is
mentally
ill,
why
is
it
disastrous
to
send
him
to
a
mental
institution
to
be
cured?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
probation
condition
upon
voluntary
commitment
to
in-patient
treatment,
commitment
to
an
institution?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
nobody's
completely
free
of
every
abnormal
mental
condition,
what's
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
that
bothers
me.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
i
don't
get
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
be
any
criminal
charge
pending
against
the
person,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
government's
proof,
if
the
witnesses
for
the
government
showed
the
commission
of
the
act
of
writing
a
check
against
its
official
funds
but
further
showed
that
the
act
was
done
under
such
circumstances
as
to
show
incontrovertibly
that
the
man
was
insane
when
he
did
it,
now
--
then
what
would
the
judge
have
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
a
judge,
a
conscientious
judge,
could
--
justice
potter
stewart
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
who
can
initiate
an
involuntary
commitment
proceeding
under
the
district
of
columbia
law?can
anybody
or
does
it
have
to
be
a
member
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
his
family
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
the
statute
provide,
do
you
happen
to
know,
does
it
--
as
to
who
can
initiate
the
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
on
page
24
of
the
record
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but
has
it
--
this
man
hasn't
tried
to
be
released,
has
he?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
we
were
reviewing
his
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
denial
of
his
release,
it
would
be
one
thing.
we'd
have
that
before
us.
we
have
those
release
provisions
before
us
and
i
under
--
you
just
said
he's
been
denied
at
least
twice
and
has
he
tested
this
out
judicially?
justice
potter
stewart
then
we'd
have
those
provisions
before
us
but
we'd
have
now
before
us
something
quite
different,
don't
we?
we
don't
have
those
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wasn't
suggesting
mr.
arens
that
you
couldn't
raise
most
of
the
questions
you've
raised.
i
was
simply
suggesting
that
the
release
provisions
of
the
statute
are
not
directly
an
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
brought
the
kind
of
action
suggested
by
the
chief
justice,
you
could
raise
those
but
you
couldn't
probably
raise
some
of
the
ones
that
you're
raising
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(inaudible)
to
the
other
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
begging
the
question
as
to
they're
criminal
if
he
was
sane,
they're
not
criminal
if
he
was
insane.
justice
potter
stewart
unless
he
had
defenses
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
made
them
non-criminal.
justice
potter
stewart
the
fact
that
he
was
tried
at
all
raises
the
presumption
that
there
was
a
finding
that
he
was
competent
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
therefore,
presumably
he
entered
the
trial
at
the
time
of
the
commitment.
justice
potter
stewart
responsible
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand,
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
you're
getting
into
the
next
case.
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
marshall,
while
we're
little
a
field,
we're
dealing
here
of
course
with
a
statute
applicable
only
to
the
district
of
columbia.
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
the
generally
applicable
federal
statutory
scheme
provides
that
in
the
--
in
criminal
cases
tried
anywhere
in
the
united
states,
except
the
united
--
district
of
columbia,
that
if
a
person
pleads
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
is
acquitted
by
the
judge
or
by
the
jury
upon
that
plea,
that
he
walks
right
out
of
the
courtroom
and
that
the
district
judge
has
no
duty
and
no
power
to
do
anything
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
because
these
are
matters
of
state
concern
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
not
federal
concern.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes.
my
understanding
is
correct,
he
walks
right
out
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
freeman
subject
of
course
to
any
commitment
procedures
which
anybody
might
want
to
invoke
under
this
applicable
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
state
statute
which
is
like
this
district
of
columbia
statute
which
makes
commitment
absolutely
inflexibly
imposable
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
doesn't
allow
the
judge
any
discretion
at
all.
