justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
the
detailed
--
that
led
to
that
commitment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
assumption
or
presumption
to
be
entered
through
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
want
to
know
is
if
the
judge
could
do
this
out
of
hand
just
capriciously?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he
must
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
had
some
basis
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
be
assumed
that
the
conditions
of
the
section
were
satisfied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
exactly
what
the
proposition
is
that
you're
tendering
to
the
court.
suppose
a
man
is
--
appears
before
--
been
brought
before
a
magistrate
and
he
gives
evidence
of
being
a
raving
maniac,
if
one
may
assume
that
such
evidence
may
overtly
be
made.
does
the
judge
--
must
the
judge
stop
then
and
there
and
appoint
counsel
and
go
through
the
proceedings
of
having
the
counsel
raise
the
question
or
may
he
at
once
make
arraignments
for
the
transfer
of
that
individual
to
st.
elizabeths?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
--
and
do
you
--
is
your
submission
that
that
is
violative
of
the
due
process
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
do
not
know
--
we
do
not
know
on
what
valid
or
substantial
or
satisfying
basis
the
commitment
here
was
made.
he
may
not
have
been
a
raving
maniac,
if
that
term
is
still
permissible
in
these
days,
but
may
have
been
a
basis
just
as
--
justified
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
your
main
point.
would
you
mind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
stating
exactly
what
it
is
you're
tendering
to
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
perhaps
one
could
understand
better
what
the
significance
of
the
facts
are
if
you
will
tell
us
with
reference
to
what
are
to
be
judged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
must
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
be
--
i
probably
was
wrong
to
ask
you
to
state
your
general
proposition
because
there
must
be
more
to
the
facts
than
one
rejection
ceased
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
all
you've
told
us
specify
is
that
the
record
doesn't
show
what
the
basis
was
on
which
the
magistrate
did
make
the
commitment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
interrupt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
plea
--
of
guilty
has
been
accepted,
what
procedure
would
have
followed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
issue
of
insanity
at
all
come
into
play?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
responsibilities
for
the
crime
to
which
he
pled
guilty
was
not
conducible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
doesn't
do
that,
if
the
magistrate
doesn't
do
that,
he
must
accept
a
plea
of
guilty,
although
he
had
before
him
reliable
indicia
indicating
mental
disturbance
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
that's
your
position,
is
it
not,
under
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
questioning
it.
i
just
want
to
know.
i'm
in
a
state
of
confusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
--
i
don't
--
i'm
not
reaching
the
legal
questions
of
my
own
legal
thinking
because
i'm
not
yet
clear
what
the
situation
is
and
therefore
i'm
much
troubled
here.
if
a
plea
of
guilty
is
offered,
is
tendered,
the
court
must
either
accept
it
or
out
of
hand
dismiss
the
charge
though
he
has
no
evidence
that
the
man
isn't
guilty.
he
must
dismiss
that
out
of
hand
in
order
to
begin
civil
mental
process,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
the
alternative
is
to
accept
the
plea
of
guilty,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
judge
--
could
the
judge
sua
sponte
have
summoned
or
did
he
by
chance,
summoned
the
psychiatrist,
take
the
witness
stand,
put
him
through
a
course
of
questioning.
then
conclude
what
he
did
conclude
on
the
basis
of
the
written
report?
he
could
do
that,
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
i'm
again
--
i'm
still
more
confused.
i
thought
you
just
said
that
the
prosecution
that
there
could
be
a
trial
of
the
issue
of
the
claimed
insanity
making
him
irresponsible
for
the
commission
of
the
deed,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
there
was
a
third.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
must
ask
you
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
government
had
called
this
psychiatrist
instead
of
having
the
municipal
court
judge
act
on
the
written
report,
suppose
the
government
said
“your
honor,
i'd
like
to
summon
dr.
jones”,
and
then
put
dr.
jones
who
merely
repeated
verbatim
what
he
had
in
his
report.
could
the
judge
then
act
as
he
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
the
third
alternative?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
does
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
first
answer
carry
with
it
that
that's
--
that
that
--
what
you
denominate
the
common
law,
the
iowa
law
is
required
by
the
due
process
clause?
because
we're
not
concerned
here
with
what
is
common
law
or
iowa
law.
we're
concerned
here
in
view
of
your
submission
that
there
was
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
due
process
that
he
may
insist
on
--
for
some
--
what
you
call
strategy
and
that
is
an
ill
sound
to
my
ear
but,
the
strategy
is
protected
by
the
constitution.
this
is
a
game
that
as
a
matter
of
due
process
he
must
be
sent
to
jail
although
the
government
is
ready
to
prove
whatever
the
adequacy
of
proof
may
be
that
in
fact
he
was
mentally
irresponsible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
those
are
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
claim
here
by
assigned
counsel
that
he
wants
to
disprove
the
substantiality
of
the
psychiatrist's
claim
or
testimony
on
the
court?
as
i
understood
your
argument
thus
far
it
is
that
absolutely,
a
man
has
a
right
to
insist
on
a
plea
of
guilty
being
taken
and
entertained
no
matter
what
the
showing
of
mentally
responsibility
of
the
act
for
which
he's
being
--
to
which
he
pled
guilty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
upshot
of
which
is,
he's
rid
of
the
charge
of
crime
against
him.
that
is
wiped
out
and
he
can
now
defend
perhaps
successfully
that
he's
mentally
unbalanced.
those
are
the
constitutional
rights
for
which
you
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
rightly
infer
that
what
the
municipal
court
did
was
warrant
it
under
the
statute
and
that
you
read
--
you
reach
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
means
--
that
means
that
in
effect
the
court
of
appeals
construed
the
statute
to
lay
down
as
a
rule
of
law
that
the
duty
of
proving
mental
responsibility
is
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution.
that's
what
is
implied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it's
unconstitutional
to
make
any
such
requirement
that
the
prosecution
has
the
duty
of
affirmatively
proving
mental
capacity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
this
court
has
said
that
it's
not
unconstitutional
to
do
the
reverse
but
i
wonder
if
we've
reached
the
point
where
it's
unconstitutional
to
put
the
burden
of
proving
mental
responsibility
upon
the
prosecution
whether
that
violates
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
he
did
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
it's
unfair
and
irrational
to
put
this
extra
burden
on
the
prosecution
instead
of
resting
on
the
presumption
it
entered
by
the
decision,
part
of
presumption
that
is
entered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you're
not
here
because
the
record
doesn't
permit
you
to
be
here.
in
this
court,
there
is
no
record
on
which
to
base
it.
that
in
fact
the
proof
was
lacking
in
those
--
essential
that
what
we
call
due
process.
this
case
isn't
here,
but
there
is
no
basis
for
finding
that
the
prosecution
didn't
maintain
its
responsibility
of
proving
that
mental
responsibility.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
here
on
the
assumption
and
the
inevitable
influence
that
the
prosecution
undertook
that
burden,
that
it
established
it,
that
the
judgment
warranted
in
finding
it
--
what
it
established
and
that
it
violates
due
process
to
put
this
extra
burden
on
the
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
reading
a
totally
different
question.
that's
the
--
that's
like
our
recent
thompson
case.
what
you've
now
said
was
--
there
was
no
basis
for
such
a
finding
by
the
court.
i
can
understand
that
claim
but
as
i
also
understand
it,
we
haven't
got
the
basis
on
which
to
pass
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
arens,
would
you
please
enlighten
me.
you
answer
justice
douglas
a
minute
ago
that
there
was
no
finding
that
the
judge
didn't
find
that
he
was
not
guilty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
the
--
page
9,
please
explain
what
that
means.
is
it
the
direction
that
the
superintendent
think
of
then?
the
court
having
found
the
accused
not
guilty
on
the
ground
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense.
isn't
that
a
finding
of
insanity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
there's
a
--
that
it's
justified
that
there
was
proof
of
it
but
there
is
certainly
as
a
finding,
if
i
understand
what
that
word
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
are
saying
is
that
it's
unconstitutional
for
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
say
if
a
man
is
found
insane
at
the
time
of
the
--
insane
for
the
transaction
for
which
he's
tried
and
he's
acquitted
because
of
that
mental
state,
congress
of
the
united
states
can't
say
you
--
that
the
judge
should
send
him
for
observation
at
a
hospital
for
his
mental
state.
that's
your
ultimate
position,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
separate
because
there's
always
the
opportunity
for
relief
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
terms
of
his
commitment
so
states,
“each
in
your
custody
on
guilty
shall
be
discharged
by
due
course
of
law.”
as
always,
an
accessibility
to
the
court
as
to
--
in
every
case
of
mental
confinement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
you
say
10
days,
a
month?
the
whole
point
is
that
this
is
an
observation
in
the
hospital.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know,
but
in
order
to
determine
what
to
treat
or
how
to
treat,
you
must
observe.
this
is
an
effort
to
ascertain
facts
on
the
basis
of
which
rational
judgments
can
be
based.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
isn't
the
case
we
have
before
us.
we
have
this
statute
and
this
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
“involuntary”
all
you're
saying
is
that
before
a
judge
accepted
a
plea
of
guilty,
he
wanted
to
have
established
and
put
upon
the
prosecution
the
burden
of
establishing
that
he's
to
send
to
jail
a
man
of
a
charge,
may
have
been
mentally
irresponsible.
that's
what
you
mean
by
involuntary.
that's
all
you
can
mean
in
the
context
of
these
facts.
of
course,
that's
involuntary,
in
that
entire
control
of
the
judicial
proceedings
are
not
in
the
hands
of
the
defendant
where
an
issue
is
his
mental
responsibility.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
so
extraordinary
to
me
since
this
is
exactly
the
english
provision
as
a
result
of
the
most
thorough
investigation
by
a
royal
conviction,
a
thorough
examination
of
the
house
of
commerce
before
the
act
of
1959
was
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
decided
section
60
subsection
2
of
that
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
talking
about
the
act
of
1978
elizabeth
protecting
chapter
72,
section
60
subdivision
2.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
which
gives
exactly
what
you've
--
so
far
as
i
can
read
it,
so
should
i
read
it.
the
first
one
deals
with
the
powers
of
court
after
conviction,
section
2
subdivision
2,
where
a
person
is
charged
before
a
magistrate's
court
with
any
act
or
omission
of
a
--
as
an
offense,
the
court
would
have
power
on
convicting
him
of
that
offense
to
make
an
order
under
subsection
1
of
this
section.
then,
if
the
court
is
satisfied
that
the
accused
did
the
act
or
made
the
omission
charged,
the
court
may
if
it
sees
fit
make
such
an
order
without
convicting
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)

are

therefore,
if
one
man
before
him,
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner,
testified
regarding
the
responsibility
(inaudible)
and
make
it
sufficiently,
implicitly
(inaudible)
to
what
he
testified,
is
one
because
you
say
that
the
commitment
as
of
now
was
not
without
justification?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
meaning
that
whether
that
is
perfectly
proved
that
at
the
time
of
commitment,
he
was
sane.
he
was
(inaudible)
and,
having
no
evidence
or
having
evidence
the
other
way
(inaudible)
as
he
is
not
under
the
statute,
but
the
statute
is
applied.
that
might
make
one
result
on
the
validity
of
the
statute
which
gives
presumption
(inaudible)
mental
health
irresponsibility
at

there
is.

(inaudible)
justice

but,
i
might
have
a
different
case.
i
might
have
a

if
the

for
which
he
has
been
charged
and
as
to

he
was
indicating

there
might
be
a
finding

(inaudible)
justice

i
know
--
justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix

i
know,
but
he
said
that
what
was
an
unfair
--
an
unfair
trial
turning
a
proceeding
for
a
commitment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
that
case
(inaudible)
case,
but
that
issue
is
not
handled
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now
on
that
assumption
or
assuming
that
(inaudible)
and
i
hope
you'd
say
something
as
to
what
this
court
would
do
assuming
that
this,
otherwise,
mean
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
how
to
correct
an
error.
i
guess
you
say
what
the
judge
did
here
all
points
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
hat
does
not
meet
my
point
that
if
a
finding
of
his
mental
condition
at
the
time
of
the
offense
is
a
week
before
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
statute
may
indulge
the
presumption
of
continuity
which
it
might
not
(inaudible)
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix

(inaudible)
the
question
might
not
be
raised.
justice
felix

when
was
the
statute
first
passed?
justice

are
you
now
defending
the
constitutionality
of
the
(inaudible)
on

that
there
were
numerous
(inaudible)
where
ever
they

committed
