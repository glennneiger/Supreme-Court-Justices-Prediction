mr.
richard
arens
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
from
the
application
of
section
301
of
title
24
of
the
d.c.
code.
the
statutory
provision
in
question
provides
for
the
mandatory
commitment
to
a
public
mental
hospital
of
all
those,
and
i
quote
the
statutory
language,
“acquitted
solely
on
the
ground
that
they
were
insane
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
act
charged
in
the
information
or
indictment.”
the
petitioner,
coronel
lynch
is
an
inmate
of
st.
elizabeths
hospital
as
a
result
of
a
commitment
pursuant
to
the
statutory
provision.
yet,
the
petitioner
is
not
an
ordinary
beneficiary
of
an
insanity
acquittal,
as
these
terms
have
been
traditionally
understood.
the
petitioner
is
an
inmate
of
st.
elizabeths
hospital
as
the
result
of
an
imposition
upon
him
of
an
insanity
defense
which
he
resisted
by
every
legal
means
at
his
disposal.
the
petitioner
in
brief
was
compelled
to
submit
to
an
insanity
defense,
the
successful
advancement
of
which
was
calculated
to
and
did
in
fact
result
to
his
incarceration
in
a
lunatic
asylum.
mr.
richard
arens
i'm
mr.
arens,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor,
i
did
not
represent
him
in
the
municipal
court.
mr.
richard
arens
a
lawyer
was
appointed
to
him
at
a
later
stage
of
the
municipal
court
proceedings.
the
facts
of
this
case
can
very
--
be
very
briefly
summarized
at
an
early
stage
of
the
municipal
court
proceedings.
the
petitioner
had
no
lawyer
and
may
i
say
this,
the
petitioner
who
had
never
before
been
convicted
of
a
criminal
offense
and
who
previously
served
honorably
as
a
commissioned
officer
in
the
armed
forces
was
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
bad
check
law
of
the
district
of
columbia.this
took
place
on
november
6,
1959.
specifically,
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
overdrawing
his
checking
account
by
$100
and
failing
to
make
restitution
within
a
period
of
five
days.
and
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
he
was
arraigned
before
the
municipal
court
and
he
lacked
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
time
of
his
arraignment
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
a
not
guilty
plea
was
entered
for
the
petitioner
by
the
court.
and
it
was
at
that
time,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
petitioner
was
committed
to
the
d.c.
general
hospital
psychiatric
division
for
examination
to
determine
his
mental
competency
to
stand
trial
pursuant
to
section
301
of
title
24
d.c.
code.
mr.
richard
arens
your
honor,
the
record
does
not
show
what
the
precise
basis
of
this
commitment
was.
i
do
not
know.
i
assume
that
some
prima
facie
evidence
of
mental
unsoundness
had
been
presented
to
the
municipal
court.
the
record
does
not
show
it.
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
we
can
--
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
the
municipal
court
judge
acted
capriciously
in
this
case.i
believe
he
acted
in
good
faith,
however,
erroneously.
mr.
richard
arens
i
--
mr.
richard
arens
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
his
attention
must
have
been
called
to
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
have
had
a
previous
history
of
mental
hospitalization
which
of
course
is
not
denied.
mr.
richard
arens
there
was
no
transcript,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
arens
section
301
(a)
of
title
24
of
the
d.c.
code
provides
that
upon
prima
facie
evidence
of
insanity
or
incompetency
to
stand
trial
or
upon
personal
observation,
the
judge
may
order
the
commitment
of
an
individual
defendant
charged
with
a
crime
by
either
an
indictment
or
an
information
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
it
can
be
validly
assumed
these
conditions
were
satisfied
although
as
an
act
of
due
process
of
law,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
assistance
of
counsel
was
necessary
even
at
that
early
stage
and
that
assistance
of
counsel
was
unavailable
at
that
time
to
the
petitioner,
for
what
is
clear
was
the
petitioner's
commitment
for
observation
was
not
challenged
essentially
because
petitioner
lacked
legal
representation
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor,
he
did
not.
and
the
record
--
mr.
richard
arens
the
statute
specifically
provides
for
an
opportunity
of
challenging
commitment
to
a
mental
hospital
by
habeas
corpus.
i
believe
that's
--
mr.
richard
arens
there
is
no
--
mr.
richard
arens
there
is
no
specific
statement
addressed
to
that
particular
point
in
the
statute.
mr.
richard
arens
upon
prima
facie
evidence
of
mental
insanity.
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
completely
correct
and
may
i
say,
if
your
honor
please,
there
has
been
at
least
one
case
in
which
an
individual
charged
with
a
minor
traffic
violation
found
herself
in
the
psychiatric
ward
of
a
public
hospital
upon
the
basis
of
that
particular
statute.
mr.
richard
arens
i'm
saying
this
essentially
to
illustrate
the
scope
to
which
this
particular
statute
has
been
subjected
in
the
day-to-day
operations
of
municipal
wards.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor,
they're
not.
they're
not.
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
completely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
under
the
statute
as
it
stands
at
present
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
judge
may
at
once
make
arrangements
for
the
transfer
of
that
particular
individual
to
--
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
that
assistance
of
counsel
should
be
available
even
at
that
stage
although
this
is
not
the
central
part
of
the
petitioner's
case.
in
fact,
i
do
not
rely
upon
--
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
indeed,
there
may
have
been
a
basis,
but
not
--
mr.
richard
arens
no.
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
recount
the
subsequent
history
of
the
judicial
proceedings
--
mr.
richard
arens
very
well,
your
honor.
the
major
issue
before
this
court,
as
i
see
it,
is
this.
may
the
prosecution
in
a
system
of
adversarial
justice
prevent
a
competent
defendant
from
waiving
any
defense
available
to
him
and
compel
him
to
assert
a
defense
of
its
choosing
to
his
disadvantage.
specifically
and
more
narrowly
applied
to
this
case
the
issue
may
be
stated
as
follows.
may
the
prosecution
compel
the
defendant
to
present
the
insanity
defense,
the
successful
advancement
of
which
ends
in
disaster
because
a
person
who
successfully
asserts
insanity
must
be
committed
to
a
mental
institution
for
an
indefinite
period.
and
because
commitment
to
a
mental
institution,
i
respectfully
submit
is
one
of
the
major
depravations
inflicted
by
our
society
insofar
as
loss
of
liberty
to
speak
of
no
other
considerations
is
concerned.
mr.
richard
arens
i
would
suggest
the
procedure
by
which
we
determine
whether
or
not
this
particular
person
is
mentally
ill
be
a
rationale
and
fair
procedure.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
procedure
employed
by
the
municipal
court
in
this
case
was
neither.
it
permitted
of
no
fair
assumption
that
this
particular
individual
was
in
fact
mentally
ill
and
was
dangerous
to
himself
or
others
as
of
the
time
of
the
adjudication.
this
was
no
civil
commitment
proceeding
in
which
by
fair
preponderance
of
evidence,
it
was
established
that
the
defendant
was
sick
at
that
time
and
that
he
needed
hospitalization.
what
took
place
in
this
case,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
a
proceeding
in
which
the
commitment
of
the
individual
petitioner
was
made
possible
under
a
standard
of
proof
requiring
the
raising
of
nothing
more
than
a
reasonable
doubt
concerning
his
mental
health.
confinement
--
mr.
richard
arens
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
wish
i
could've
stated
it
that
succinctly.
that
is
precisely
--
mr.
richard
arens
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
completely
correct,
your
honor,
and
may
i
say
it
is
not
the
original
commitment
which
is
the
subject
of
attack
in
this
court.
it
is
the
subsequent
commitment
to
which
i
ask
leave
to
address
myself
at
this
time.
for
after
his
original
commitment
at
the
district
of
columbia
general
hospital,
that
hospital
reported
a
--
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
your
honor,
i
should
be
delighted
to
do
so.
the
petitioner
had
been
charged
for
the
violation
of
the
bad
check
law
of
the
district
of
columbia.
this
happened
on
november
6,
1959.
at
that
time,
upon
arraignment
in
municipal
court,
he
was
not
assisted
by
counsel.
the
court
entered
a
not
guilty
plea
for
him
and
committed
him
to
the
d.c.
general
hospital
for
observation
to
determine
his
competency
to
stand
trial
upon
that
charge.
now,
on
december
4,
1959,
that
hospital
reported
to
the
court
that
petitioner
was
of
unsound
mind
and
mentally
incompetent
to
participate
in
his
own
defense.
some
time
elapsed
after
that,
approximately
three
weeks,
and
the
hospital
then
reported
a
change
in
the
petitioner's
mental
condition.
it
reported
that
petitioner
had
sufficiently
recovered
to
be
capable
of
participating
in
his
own
defense,
but
that
he
had
been
suffering
from
a
mental
disease
at
the
time
of
the
crimes
charged
in
the
information
and
that
the
crimes
if
any,
were
probably
the
products
of
said
disease.
i
say
“probably,”
if
your
honors
please,
because
there
was
no
statement
of
certainty
within
the
diagnostic
view
propounded
by
the
government's
psychiatrist
as
reflected
in
his
letter
to
the
municipal
court
reproduced
on
page
26
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.
the
psychiatrist
informed
the
municipal
court
in
that
letter
that
petitioner
was
suffering
from
a
manic
depressive
psychosis.
however,
the
causal
relationship
between
that
disease
and
the
criminal
act
set
forth
in
the
indictment
was
described
in
less
than
categorically
unqualified
terms.
the
illness
declared
the
doctor,
and
i
quote
him,
“would
particularly
affect
his
judgment
in
regard
to
financial
matters
so
that
the
crime
charged
would
be
a
product
of
this
mental
disease.”
now,
it
was
on
the
basis
of
this
certification
that
petitioner
was
brought
before
the
municipal
court
again
on
december
29
as
competent
to
stand
trial
upon
the
charges
then
pending
against
him,
and
he
was
then
represented
by
counsel
appointed
by
the
municipal
court.
petitioner
thereupon,
acting
through
counsel,
insistently
and
consistently
sought
to
affect
the
withdrawal
of
the
not
guilty
plea
which
had
been
entered
for
him
and
enter
a
guilty
plea
in
its
stead.
this,
he
was
not
allowed
to
do.
a
trial
was
held
over
the
petitioner's
objection,
obviously,
upon
--
mr.
richard
arens
yes
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
arens
the
defendant
would've
been
subject
to
a
maximum
sentence
of
one
year
in
the
district
of
columbia
penal
system.
mr.
richard
arens
two
years
insofar
as
there
were
two
crimes,
yes.
mr.
richard
arens
the
judge
of
course
could
have
committed
the
individual
defendant
to
a
mental
hospital
under
section
301
if
at
the
time
of
sentencing
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
individual
defendant
was
incompetent
to
participate
in
the
proceedings
or
appreciate
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
in
which
he
was
involved.
mr.
richard
arens
not
as
i
see
it,
if
your
honor
please.
at
that
stage,
the
defendant
might
have
received
a
maximum
of
two
years,
one
year
each
if
consecutive
sentences
had
been
imposed
or
he
could've
been
placed
upon
probation
with
provision
for
psychiatric
out-patient
treatment
if
the
judge
had
considered
that
desirable.
mr.
richard
arens
that
could
conceivably
have
taken
place.
but
the
drastic
difference
between
that
procedure,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
the
procedure
followed
in
this
case
is
that
the
petitioner
could
have
established
his
eligibility
for
release
with
the
greatest
of
ease
compared
to
the
situation
which
he
now
find
himself
where
his
eligibility
for
release
is
dependent
upon
a
showing
by
proof
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt
under
recent
court
of
appeals
decision
that
he
is
free
of
any
abnormal
mental
condition
and
that
he
is
not
likely
to
engage
in
further
check
writing
in
the
reasonably
foreseeable
future.
and
i
believe
the
consequences
are
very
sharply
different.
mr.
richard
arens
the
court
of
appeals
has
--
mr.
richard
arens
the
court
of
appeals
has
interpreted
abnormal
mental
condition
to
cover
apparently
the
length
and
depth
of
mental
disorders
listed
in
the
american
psychiatric
association
manual.
in
a
recent
case,
for
example,
the
court
of
appeals
declared
that
the
mere
fact
that
an
individual
suffered
from
a
psychoneurosis,
a
condition
which
modern
psychiatrists
inform
us
is
so
widespread
as
to
perhaps
afflict
50-60%
of
the
population
if
not
more,
is
not
eligible
for
release
in
st.
elizabeths
if
he
cannot
show
that
his
psychoneurosis
is
not
of
such
a
nature
as
to
prevent
him
from
engaging
in
further
check
writing,
the
offense
with
which
he
was
originally
charged.
in
other
words,
check
writing
proclivity
stemming
from
a
merely
neurotic,
as
distinct
from
psychotic
condition
is
sufficient
to
keep
an
individual
at
st.
elizabeths
until
such
time
as
he's
completely
rid
of
it
and
the
burden
of
establishing
his
eligibility
for
release
is
entirely
upon
him.
mr.
richard
arens
this
is
the
criminal
statute
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
civil
commitment
statute
where
release
procedures
are
infinitely
more
liberal.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
at
all
that
the
municipal
court
had
the
power
to
dismiss
the
charges
and
recommend
the
initiation
of
civil
commitment
proceedings.
mr.
richard
arens
for
civil
commitment
proceedings
to
be
initiated
the
charges
would
have
to
be
dismissed
under
the
civil
commitment
statute
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
richard
arens
the
district
of
columbia
statute,
and
i'm
referring
now
to
title
21
of
the
d.c.
code,
permits
the
initiation
of
civil
commitment
proceeding
only
in
the
absence
of
any
criminal
charges
which
--
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
the
way
i
understand
it
--
mr.
richard
arens
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
your
honor
please.
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
civil
commitment
proceedings
have
been
initiated
pursuant
to
title
21
of
the
d.c.
code
where
criminal
charges
were
still
pending
against
the
individual
defendant.
mr.
richard
arens
my
position
--
mr.
richard
arens
this
is
part
of
my
position.
i
believe
the
individual
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
enter
a
guilty
plea
in
order
to
avert
the
i'm
--
involuntary
imposition
upon
him
of
an
insanity
defense.
mr.
richard
arens
it
--
mr.
richard
arens
if
civil
commitment
procedures
are
to
be
initiated,
no
criminal
charges
can
be
left
pending.
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
one
alternative.
there's
a
further
alternative,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
further
alternative
would
be
to
put
the
government
to
the
proof.
let
them
establish
the
commission
of
the
particular
offense,
but
prevent
them
from
imposing
an
insanity
defense,
the
successful
assertion
of
which
results
in
loss
of
liberty.
mr.
richard
arens
could
the
judge
summon
a
psychiatrist
independently
for
the
purpose
of
asserting
an
insanity
defense?
mr.
richard
arens
i
respectfully
submit
that
he
could
not.
mr.
richard
arens
it
isn't
clear,
your
honor,
if
it
was
the
judge
or
the
prosecution
which
did
that
and
i
believe
the
government
has
conceded
that
we
do
not
know.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor.
i
did
not
say
that.
i
did
say
there
was
--
there
were
two
alternatives.
one,
the
acceptance
of
the
guilty
plea
or
the
dismissal
of
the
charges
in
the
initiation
of
civil
commitment
procedure
--
mr.
richard
arens
and
the
other
possibility,
if
it
please
your
honor,
would
be
putting
the
government
to
the
proof
in
establishing
the
commission
of
the
offense
charged
in
the
information.
mr.
richard
arens
with
this
(inaudible)
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor,
he
could
not.
i
respectfully
--
mr.
richard
arens
the
third
alternative
is
putting
the
government
to
its
proof
without
putting
--
with
the
caveat
that
the
defendant
be
permitted
to
manage
his
own
trial
strategy
and
that
an
involuntary
insanity
defense
not
be
imposed
against
--
upon
us.
mr.
richard
arens
i
respectfully
submit
that
insofar
as
the
defendant
does
not
rely
upon
this
testimony,
this
testimony
cannot
be
used
to
affect
his
loss
of
liberty
because
it
involves
procedural
irregularity
striking
at
the
heart
of
due
process.
mr.
richard
arens
my
answer
to
this
mr.
justice
whittaker
is
two-fold.
the
traditional
common
law
view
has
been
that
an
individual
defendant
has
a
right
to
enter
a
guilty
plea
and
as
the
iowa
supreme
court
has
put
it,
reasons
other
than
that
he
is
guilty
may
induce
a
defendant
to
enter
a
guilty
plea
and
therein,
he
must
be
permitted
to
judge
for
himself.
my
second
answer
if
it
please
the
court,
is
simple.
mr.
richard
arens
the
--
mr.
richard
arens
that's
completely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
completely
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
--
mr.
richard
arens
my
position
if
it
please
the
court,
is
that
we
cannot
have
an
inversion
of
the
roles
of
the
prosecution
and
the
defense.
mr.
richard
arens
in
which
the
defendant
has
no
notice
as
to
what
it
is
that
he
is
called
upon
to
defend
himself
against
and
which
he
does
not
know
that
the
trial
in
which
he
is
specifically
charged
with
uttering
a
check
with
intent
to
defraud
is
about
to
be
transformed
into
an
inquiry
into
his
mental
health.
mr.
richard
arens
there
is
an
alternate
proposition,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
that
is
conceding
the
right
to
the
court
for
purposes
of
argument
to
reject
a
guilty
plea.
we
cannot
concede
the
right
to
the
court
to
impose
a
defense
against
the
will
of
the
individual
defendant
particularly
if
the
successful
assertion
of
that
defense
comports
loss
of
liberty
without
notice,
without
an
opportunity
to
rebut
the
defense
which
is
in
fact
no
defense
at
all
but
a
method
of
inflicting
a
very
serious
sanction
and
without
assistance
of
counsel
--
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
your
honor.
i
do
make
that
argument
and
i
make
it
consistently
with
the
view
expressed
by
judge
mcgarraghy
in
the
district
court
in
granting
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
sustaining
the
writs.
judge
mcgarraghy
declared,
“i
don't
believe
that
the
municipal
court
had
a
right
to
convert
this
proceeding
into
a
civil
commitment
proceeding
which
is
what
it
did.
therefore,
i
don't
think
the
municipal
court
had
jurisdiction
to
commit
the
petitioner
to
st.
elizabeths.”
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
my
understanding
and
i
hope
i
have
not
misinformed
--
mr.
richard
arens
--
the
court.
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
is.
section
302
of
title
24
of
the
district
of
columbia
code
makes
it
possible
for
any
individual
found
guilty
of
crime
while
serving
sentence
to
be
transferred
to
a
mental
hospital.
significantly
however,
if
it
please
the
court,
his
confinement
within
that
mental
hospital
would
be
limited
to
the
term
of
his
sentence
and
he
would
not
be
under
the
disadvantage
that
petitioner
is
in
now.
mr.
richard
arens
the
hospital
would
have
to
release
him,
if
your
honor
please,
unless
civil
commitment
proceedings
were
instituted
and
there
would
of
course
be
no
bar
to
the
institution
of
civil
commitment
proceedings
upon
the
expiration
of
the
sentence.
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
substantially
my
understanding
of
what
transpired.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor,
we
have
no
transcript
to
the
record
in
the
municipal
court.
mr.
richard
arens
i
have
not
been
able
to
obtain
any
reliable
information
on
the
subject.
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
the
municipal
court
judge
acted
with
the
best
of
humanitarian
--
mr.
richard
arens
that
much
is
shown
in
it.
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
arens
well,
your
honor.
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
the
only
thing
that
is
plain
is
that
the
defense
of
insanity
was
asserted
for
the
petitioner
either
by
the
government
or
by
the
court.
no
formal
insanity
plea
is
required
under
the
rules
prevailing
in
the
circuit.
mr.
richard
arens
and
may
i
then
say,
reverting
to
the
statement
of
facts
that
evidence
was
heard
over
the
objection
of
the
petitioner
and
this
evidence
included
testimony
by
a
government
psychiatrist
who
testified
substantially
and
afforded
the
hospital
report
which
i
have
referred
to.
as
a
pauper,
the
petitioner
lacked
opportunity
of
any
independent
psychiatric
verification
of
the
claims
concerning
as
mental
health
which
were
propounded
by
the
one
psychiatrist
who
testified
for
the
government.
accordingly,
petitioner
offered
no
expert
evidence
in
rebuttal
of
the
evidence
of
the
insanity
which
had
been
thus
presented.
lack
of
facilities
in
municipal
court
for
the
procurement
of
qualified
psychiatrist
at
government
expense
has
been
repeatedly
set
forth
below
in
briefs
and
has
never
been
denied
by
the
government.
it
cannot
be
asserted
that
petitioner's
counsel
requested
independent
psychiatric
scrutiny
but
had
he
done
so,
it
would
have
been
a
futile
gesture.
at
the
conclusion
of
this
trial,
the
chief
judge
--
mr.
richard
arens
there
is
no
evidence
--
mr.
richard
arens
--
to
indicate
that
he
had
requested
it.
i
merely
say
that
had
he
requested
it
there,
it
would
have
been
a
futile
gesture
in
the
absence
of
any
facilities
on
the
part
of
the
municipal
court
for
rendering
services
of
this
kind.
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
that
a
defendant
has
a
right
not
to
have
any
defense
imposed
upon
him.
mr.
richard
arens
then,
if
your
honor
please,
most,
though
not
all
of
my
procedural
objections
to
what
took
place
in
municipal
court
would
have
been
avoided.
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
it
would've
been
a
constitutional
proceeding
up
to
a
point.
the
objection
to
the
proceeding
would
then
have
come
at
a
later
stage
significantly
at
the
point
where
the
commitment
of
the
defendant
was
made
without
affording
him
an
opportunity
to
show
cause
why
commitment
should
be
denied
because
of
an
improvement
in
his
mental
state
and
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
no
longer
ill
or
dangerous
to
himself
or
others.
mr.
richard
arens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
because
under
davis
against
united
states
decided
by
this
court,
an
acquittal
by
reason
of
insanity
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
a
finding
of
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
richard
arens
and
accordingly
the
commitment
would
still
have
been
objectionable
not
for
lack
of
a
fair
hearing
and
the
imposition
of
an
insanity
defense
without
notice
and
without
opportunity
to
rebut.
but
for
lack
of
affording
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
show
cause
why
commitment
should
be
denied
because
notwithstanding
any
previously
existing
mental
state,
he
was
not
as
of
the
time
of
the
adjudication
--
mr.
richard
arens
--
was
mentally
ill.
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
arens
our
position
goes
all
the
way,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
richard
arens
the
statute
which
authorizes
deprivation
of
human
liberty
without
affording
the
target
of
the
particular
proceeding
an
opportunity
to
show
cause
why
commitment
should
be
denied
strikes
me
as
repugnant
to
the
due
process
clause
is
--
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
there
is
no
requirement
for
a
special
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
richard
arens
yes
--
it
could've
been.
mr.
richard
arens
he
could
conceive
they
have
dismissed
the
proceedings
as
a
matter
of
individual
discretion.
he
could
have
stated
that
the
individual
defendant
although
guilty
of
the
factual
transaction
lacked
a
particular
intent
to
defraud
and
he
might
have
avoided
inquiry
into
his
mental
health
under
the
criminal
insanity
law
with
consequences
as
far
reaching
as
the
ones
which
he
faces
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
arens
there's
no
question
--
mr.
richard
arens
there's
no
question
about
that
upon
--
mr.
richard
arens
if
i
understand
your
honor
correctly,
he
certainly
could've
been
given
a
determinate
prison
sentence.
the
warden
could've
been
alerted
concerning
his
mental
condition.
he
could've
been
transferred
pursuant
to
section
302
to
st.
elizabeths
hospital,
although
his
confinement
therein
would
have
been
restricted
to
the
term
of
his
sentence,
or
he
could've
been
placed
on
probation
with
the
requirement
that
he
undergo
psychiatric
treatment
on
an
out-patient
basis
which
is
a
medical
matter,
may
have
been
what
was
indicated
for
the
petitioner
was
never
afforded
--
mr.
richard
arens
yes
--
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
this
would
probably
have
been
preferable.
mr.
richard
arens
without
any
question
at
all,
mr.
justice
warren.
mr.
richard
arens
precisely
and
may
i
say,
if
the
court
--
if
it
please
the
court,
that
dismissals
of
proceedings
particularly
on
the
municipal
court
level
are
a
common
place
occurrence.
a
first-offender
almost
invariably
succeeds
in
having
the
charges
against
him
dismissed
if
there
is
any
showing
at
all
that
he
has
a
job,
that
he
has
a
residence,
and
that
he
is
vouched
for
by
citizens
of
some
reputation.
it
is
amazing
that
in
this
case
in
which
the
government
asserts
concern
for
the
rights
of
this
particular
individual
no
dismissal
of
proceedings
took
place.
the
individual
was
forced
to
trial
and
committed
to
st.
elizabeths
until
such
time
as
he
was
certified
by
the
hospital
authorities
has
recovered
from
his
mental
illness
and
not
likely
to
be
dangerous
to
himself
or
others
in
the
reasonable
future.
and
there
was
no
finding
by
the
municipal
court
as
to
the
petitioner's
then
existing
state
of
mind
or
social
dangerousness.
mr.
richard
arens
i
can
--
mr.
richard
arens
as
a
general
matter
of
practice,
members
of
the
family
take
the
initiative
but
i
can
vouch
to
the
court
from
the
fact
the
government
has
on
numerous
occasions
successfully
initiated
commitment
proceedings
including
commitment
proceedings
in
cases
in
which
i
have
represented
certain
clients.
mr.
richard
arens
the
statute
permits
the
government
to
initiate,
specifically
permits
the
government,
the
police
to
initiate
civil
commitment
proceedings
under
certain
circumstances.
and
in
one
particular
case,
united
states
versus
haggard,
judge
youngdahl
dismissed
a
murder
charge
pending
against
that
defendant
and
then
upon
my
recommendation
signed
a
civil
commitment
order
upon
a
petition
which
i
had
prepared.
the
government
would've
been
in
an
identical
position
and
could've
done
the
same
thing
and
in
fact
it
has
in
similar
cases.
but
if
i
may
sum
the
factual
situation
of
this
case
up,
neither
the
petitioner
nor
his
counsel
raised
the
issue
of
insanity,
neither
he
nor
his
counsel
introduced
any
evidence
bearing
on
the
issue
of
insanity
and
no
motion
or
request
was
made
in
his
behalf
for
a
finding
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
every
move
toward
that
finding
was
resisted.
however,
the
presiding
judge
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
a
government
psychiatrist
was
not
rebutted,
found
the
petitioner
not
guilty
on
the
ground
of
insanity
and
committed
--
affected
his
commitment
in
the
manner
aforesaid.
significantly,
there
was
no
finding
petitioner's
insanity
as
of
the
time
of
the
adjudication
nor
was
a
hearing
afforded
the
petitioner
in
which
he
might
have
shown
cause
why
confinement
was
improper
for
practical
legal
or
medical
reasons
thus
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
arens
in
the
case
in
chief,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
richard
arens
if
i
understand
--
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
quite
correct.
it
was
either
the
court
or
the
government
but
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
--
the
petitioner
never
denied
the
writing
of
the
bad
checks
and
accordingly
i
do
not
think
there
was
any
conflict
on
that
point.
there
was
certainly
no
conflict
as
to
psychiatric
testimony
since
petitioner
had
no
psychiatrist
available.
we
do
not
know
whether
the
psychiatrist
was
called
by
the
government
or
the
court.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
the
statute
authorized
the
involuntary
imposition
of
the
insanity
defense.
i
do
not
believe
congress
contemplated
a
situation
in
which
an
individual
who
had
not
affirmatively
--
mr.
richard
arens
as
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
action
of
the
municipal
court
was
warranted
by
the
statute.
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
it
is
--
mr.
richard
arens
no
your
honor.
having
the
re
--
having
the
prosecution
prove
mental
responsibility
or
lack
of
responsibility
in
no
way
violates
due
process.
mr.
richard
arens
provided
the
prosecution
does
so
in
a
procedure
which
can
be
denominated
as
fair
and
rational
and
provided
the
consequences
of
the
particular
defense
are
not
as
onerous
and
punitive
as
they
turn
out
to
be
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
richard
arens
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
unfair
and
irrational
to
do
it
under
a
standard
of
proof
which
permits
the
forfeiture
of
human
liberty
upon
the
basis
of
a
doubt
concerning
mental
health.
mr.
richard
arens
may
i
--
mr.
richard
arens
may
i
address
myself
to
the
points
so
cogently
raised
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
as
follows.
suppose
that
in
a
criminal
--
in
a
particular
case
in
which
commitment
is
involved,
the
--
a
jury
trial
was
held
and
suppose
that
a
psychiatrist
provides
evidence
infinitely
more
persuasive
and
unequivocal
in
the
evidence
provided
in
this
case
as
to
the
mental
illness
of
the
defendant
and
the
causal
relationship
of
that
mental
illness
were
the
crime
charged.
and
suppose
the
judge
thereupon
charges
the
jury
that
commitment
to
a
mental
hospital,
and
let
us
assume
this
is
a
civil
commitment
proceeding,
is
possible
upon
the
showing
of
nothing
more
than
reasonable
doubt
concerning
his
mental
health.
will
this
court
uphold
loss
of
human
liberty
under
a
standard
of
this
particular
type
regardless
of
the
weight
of
the
evidence?
mr.
richard
arens
mr.
--
mr.
richard
arens
there
is
no
finding
in
this
case
at
all
by
the
judge
that
the
individual
was
insane
as
of
the
time
of
the
adjudication.
implicit
of
course
an
acquittal
by
reason
of
insanity
is
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
defendant's
mental
health
as
of
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crimes
alleged
in
the
information.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
forfeiture
of
human
liberty
upon
the
basis
of
a
reasonable
doubt
in
a
proceeding
in
which
the
defense
is
forced
upon
the
defendant
without
notice
as
to
the
consequences
and
without
an
opportunity
to
rebut
what
is
not
a
defense
but
an
offense
--
mr.
richard
arens
--
offends
due
process.
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
your
honor.
the
senate
and
house
reports
--
mr.
richard
arens
i'm
reading
from
page
53
--
mr.
richard
arens
--
of
my
brief.
mr.
richard
arens
if
your
honor
please,
refer
to
the
situation
where
the
accused
has
pleaded
insanity
as
the
defense
to
a
crime
and
the
jury
has
found
the
defendant
was
in
fact
insane
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
may
i
say
that
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
section
301,
congress
knew
of
no
single
example
in
which
an
involuntary
imposition
of
an
insanity
defense
had
been
tolerated
by
the
courts
and
it's
concerned
at
that
time
as
its
well-known,
was
that
the
liberal
laws
rule
of
criminal
responsibility
presented
by
the
durham
case
would
enable
numerous
dangerous
criminals
who
had
affirmatively
taken
advantage
of
what
was
thought
to
be
a
possible
loophole
to
roam
the
streets
and
endanger
the
public
safety.
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
without
any
question,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
that's
right.
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
completely
correct.
mr.
richard

no,
i
did
not
say
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
richard

i
said
no
--
there
wasn't

mr.

that

correct,
mr.
justice

mr.

no,
your
honor.
i've
--
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
this
comports
nothing
more
than
a
finding
of
the
reasonable
doubt
concerning
insanity
as
of
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
alleged
offense
as
distinct
from
the
time
of
the
petitioner's
commitment
to
st.
elizabeths
hospital.
mr.
richard
arens
i'm
quite
sure
the
government
does
not
agree
with
me
on
this
point.
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
indeed
--
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
the
d.c.
general
hospital,
after
having
originally
declared
this
individual
to
be
too
sick
to
stand
trial
subsequently
announced
that
he
was
then
free
of
such
mental
disease
as
would
render
him
incompetent
to
participate
in
proceedings.
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
is.
the
situation
would
be
very
different
if
the
statute
were
to
provide
for
example,
that
after
an
acquittal
by
reason
of
insanity,
an
individual
defendant
were
to
be
committed
for
an
extremely
short
period
of
observation,
after
which
a
report
had
to
be
returned
to
the
court
certifying
as
to
what
his
mental
state
then
was,
the
commitment
which
not
to
express
after
an
insanity
acquittal
is
indefinite
and
to
establish
it
--
mr.
richard
arens
the
opport
--
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
will
not
do
to
say
that
because
habeas
corpus
may
be
resorted
to
in
the
future,
liberty
may
be
deprived
at
a
particular
time
without
due
process
of
law
and
--
mr.
richard
arens
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
district
court
has
refused
to
consider
habeas
corpus
petitions
which
have
been
filed
as
long
as
six
months
after
an
acquittal
on
the
ground
--
mr.
richard
arens
insofar
as
this
particular
individual
has
been
forced
into
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
called
a
special
class
of
individuals
who
may
not
be
released
in
the
manner
in
which
individuals
who'd
been
committed
pursuant
to
civil
commitment
law
may
be
released.
we
do
have
--
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
your
honor,
he
has
tried
twice
to
be
released.
there's
no
longer
mentally
ill
and
he
has
not
been
able
to
meet
the
exacting
standards
of
the
court
of
appeals'
standards
which
require
that
he
prove
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
st.
elizabeths
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
failing
to
certify
that
his
psychoneurotic
propensity
will
not
in
the
reasonably
foreseeable
future
result
in
further
check
writing.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor,
that
has
not
been
tested.
i
merely
--
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
we
have
an
individual
who
has
been
forced
into
an
intolerable
position
as
a
result
of
the
involuntary
imposition
of
the
insanity
defense.
part
of
the
realities
of
this
position
is
his
inability
to
secure
a
release
under
standards
prevailing
in
the
civil
commitment
field.
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
certainly
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
but
that
is
both
extraordinary
and
unprecedented
for
this
or
any
other
court
to
countenance
the
imposition
of
the
defense
which
is
spurned
by
the
defendant.
and
no
rule
appears
to
be
better
settled
but
that
constitutional
defenses
and
privileges
are
subject
to
waiver.
and
may
i
say,
if
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
were
not
subject
to
waiver,
we
would
be
preventing
defendants
from
taking
the
stand
and
testifying
their
own
behalf
and
providing
a
rational
account
of
the
transaction.
i
believe
we
would
be
striking
a
due
process
of
law.
mr.
richard
arens
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
respectfully
take
issue
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter
on
the
english
position,
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
which
his
quite
unmistakable.
the
eng
--
mr.
richard
arens
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
for
a
moment,
i
will
attempt
to
--
i
have
cited,
if
your
honor
please,
section
443
of
the
royal
commission
report
on
capital
punishment.
mr.
richard
arens
i'm
not
--
mr.
richard
arens
well,
i
--
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
undoubtedly.
we
could
make
a
frontal
attack
upon
the
release
procedures
of
the
district
commitment
law
if
we
had
alleged
in
the
case
which
finally
came
before
this
court
that
he
had
recovered
from
all
mental
illness.
all
we
can
allege
at
this
particular
time
is
that
he
was
put
in
a
position
of
severe
disadvantage
and
that
--
but
one
of
the
disadvantages
is
the
difficulty
which
he
would
inevitably
encounter
if
he
were
to
seek
release
at
a
future
time.
mr.
richard
arens
the
release
procedure
--
mr.
richard
arens
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
this
would
be
independent
--
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
that
is
stating
the
position
of
petitioner
with
perfect
precision.
mr.
richard
arens
not
directly
an
issue.
mr.
richard
arens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
summarizing
what
i've
already
said,
may
i
state
the
question
emerging
in
this
case,
is
not
essentially
whether
an
insanity
defense
may
be
forced
upon
a
recalcitrant
and
competent
defendant
with
a
view
of
spearing
him
life
or
loss
of
liberty.
the
question
is
whether
an
insanity
defense
may
be
forced
upon
a
recalcitrant
and
competent
defendant
with
the
view
to
depriving
him
of
his
liberty
without
adequate
safeguards
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
safeguards
emerging
from
the
situation
confronting
this
court
were
not
adequate.
the
government
concedes
that
there
was
no
formal
notice.
the
opportunity
to
defend
effectively,
in
terms
of
psychiatric
assistance
was
nonexistent
and
the
standard
of
proof
was
clearly
and
explicitly
that
of
reasonable
doubt,
and
reasonable
doubt
alone.
there
was
no
finding
that
petitioner
was
insane
as
of
the
time
he
was
committed
and,
when
committed,
he
was
committed
under
circumstances
that
made
his
release
subject
to
an
onerous
oppressive
and,
i
submit,
unconstitutional
standard,
a
matter
which
is
not
all
together
relevant
in
considering
his
present
plight.
the
hypothetical
situation
applied
by
the
chief
justice
strikes
me
as
precisely
the
situation
which
would
become
common
place
if
the
lynch
rule
were
to
be
maintained.
we've
suggested
that
the
application
of
the
lynch
doctrine
would
enable
the
prosecution
to
assert
by
no
means
implosively
that
almost
any
traffic
violation
was
attributable
to
the
tension
generated
by
a
mild
and
perhaps
a
very
widespread
mental
disorder.
such
assertion
backed
by
evidence
presenting
no
more
than
a
reasonable
doubt
concerning
the
mental
health
of
a
defendant
as
of
the
time
of
that
violation
would
result
in
the
commitment
of
that
defendant
to
saint
elizabeths
hospital
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
and
one
might
add
without
any
assurance
of
adequate
treatment
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
auburn
against
overholser
declared
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
psychiatric
treatment
at
saint
elizabeths
to
be
a
matter
of
legislative
and
not
a
judicial
concern.
i
conclude,
with
the
observation
of
a
legal
publicist,
undoubtedly
known
to
this
court,
aristotle
observed
long
ago
that
punishment
is
a
sort
of
medicine.
we
have
considerable
cause
today
to
observe
that
medicine
can
be
a
sort
of
punishment
sans
due
process
of
law.
the
use
of
medicine
as
punishment
now
calls
for
the
correcting
hand
of
this
court.
