mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
mr.
justice
black,
and
if
it
please
the
court.
before
i
state
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case,
it
might
be
well
for
me
to
dispose
of
one
or
two
matters
that
were
--
that
came
before
the
court
in
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
on
yesterday.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
i
should
say
that
the
dean
of
our
law
school
out
in
missouri,
although
he
was
called
as
a
witness
to
testify
before
this
hearing,
was
not
a
patient
of
dr.
freeman.
there
was
one
other
that
--
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
that's
correct
but
i
want
it
abundantly
understood
because
he
is
a
highly
regarded
man
in
our
state.
one
other
thing
that
i
think
i
might
touch
on
very
briefly
is
this.
some
question
was
raised
on
yesterday
as
to
how
it
was
that
this
matter
came
to
the
attention
of
the
bar
examining
board.
the
record
--
at
page
66
of
the
record,
if
the
court
is
interested,
shows
that
a
mr.
alexander,
who
was
a
member
of
the
boone
county,
that's
columbia,
missouri
bar,
represented
the
state
board
of
healing
arts,
as
it's
called
there,
in
this
proceeding
against
dr.
freeman.
he
took
the
precaution
of
calling
mr.
trombley,
who
is
a
young
member
of
the
bar
in
boone
county,
knowing
that
trombley
represented
two
of
the
witnesses
who
were
to
appear
before
this
board
including
mrs.
werheyki
who
is
prominently
mentioned
in
this
record,
saying
that
if
anything
was
done
with
reference
to
these
witnesses,
he
would
like
to
know
about
it
and
trombley
promised
him
to
do
so,
and
trombley
testified
that
there
were
some
things
done
but
the
only
thing
that
had
any
relationship
to
the
petitioner
was
the
matter
of
mrs.
werheyki
and
it
was
in
that
way
that,
after
trombley
had
received
his
telephone
call,
he
reported
the
matter
to
mr.
alexander
and,
apparently,
that's
the
way
it
came
before
the
state
board
of
bar
examiners.
i
would
like
to
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
it's
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case
that
this
record
presents
two
issues
of
fact.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes?
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes,
we
do,
mr.
justice,
and
the
board
is
appointed
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes,
for
four
years.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
members
of
the
bar?
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
excuse
me,
yes,
there
are
five,
as
i
recall.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes,
they
are.
if
i
may
say
so,
they
are
distinguished
members
of
the
bar.
it
is
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case
that
this
record
presents
two
issues
of
fact.
one,
whether
the
petitioner,
michael
zipkin,
tried
to
intimidate
a
witness
in
the
dr.
freeman
hearing
and,
second,
whether
the
petitioner,
himself,
was
a
truthful
witness
when
he
appeared
before
the
state
board
of
bar
examiners.
both
of
these
questions
of
fact
were
resolved
against
the
petitioner
by
the
state
board
at
their
hearings.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
mr.
justice,
the
--
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
at
the
time
that
this
matter
occurred,
this
hearing
was
held,
the
scope
of
the
review
was
none
too
well-defined
so
far
as
the
rule
of
the
supreme
court
was
concerned
that
governed
the
proceeding,
but
i
can
tell
you
what
happened.
what
happened
was
that
this
board,
not
acting
as
a
prosecuting
body,
but
simply
as
a
board,
had
the
power
to
subpoena
witnesses,
did
subpoena
witnesses
including
the
--
well,
all
their
six
witnesses
in
all.
they
came
and
testified.
some
were
favorable
to
the
petitioner,
some
were
unfavorable
to
him.
they
made
their
finding
which
is
reported
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
93,
as
i
recall
it
and
then,
this
finding
was
filed
with
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
i
think
it
is
apparent
that
the
supreme
court
treated
the
board
as
a
trial
court.
the
supreme
--
in
the
supreme
court,
a
motion
for
review
was
filed
by
mr.
zipkin's
then
attorney
because
the
findings
of
the
board
were
contrary
to
him
found
that
he
had
not
shown
that
he
was
of
good
moral
character.
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
had
before
it,
when
it
made
its
determination
and
entered
its
judgment,
the
record
--
the
transcript
of
the
record
below,
the
motion
for
review,
and
the
suggestions
that
were
filed
in
support
of
the
motion
which
were
in
the
form
and
nature
of
a
brief.
they
did
not
hear
the
witnesses,
but
they
had
the
transcript
of
the
evidence.
they
had
a
brief
in
support
of
mr.
zipkin's
position
and
under
those
circumstances
the
supreme
court
entered
a
judgment
affirming
the
action
of
the
examining
board.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes,
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
treated
it
that
way.
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
findings
of
the
bar
board
were
supported
by
competent
and
substantial
evidence
so
that,
really,
it
was
as
if
this
were
an
equity
case
that
came
up
from
the
trial
court
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
and
was
tried
de
novo
but,
of
course,
all
that
was
required
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
findings
below.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
no,
as
i
recall
it,
it's
substantially
the
same,
but
they
have
laid
out
the
ground
rules
of
procedure
a
little
more
carefully.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes,
yes
mr.
justice.
there
had
been
one
case
of
which
i
have
knowledge
that
had
been
tried
by
the
board
and
where
the
board
had
found
that
the
petitioner
was
not
--
had
not
established
that
he
was
of
good
moral
character
and
where
he
filed
a
review
with
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
and
where
the
supreme
court
upheld
the
bar
board
and
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court
but
the
petition
was
denied.
may
i
then
return
to
these
two
factual
issues
and
--
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
no,
it
does
not.
as
to
this
first
issue
of
fact,
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
intimidated
a
witness
in
the
freeman
hearing
as
the
board
found,
i
think
it
is
important
for
me
to
briefly
restate
the
background
that
existed
at
the
time
that
this
telephone
call
was
made
by
the
petitioner
to
mr.
trombley.
the
petitioner
was
a
patient
of
dr.
freeman's
and
apparently
a
good
personal
friend
of
his.
irene
werheyki,
who
is
mentioned
prominently
in
this
record,
was
a
woman
who
was
also
a
patient
of
dr.
freeman's,
a
charity
patient.
she
had
--
i
think
it
is
clear
she
was
a
rather
pitiable
figure.
she
had
been
married.
she
was
divorced.
after
her
divorce,
a
baby
was
born.
she
was
without
means.
it
was
under
those
circumstances
that
the
trombleys
took
her
into
their
home
and
she
lived
in
a
basement-apartment
with
her
baby,
i
presume,
and
worked
in
--
for
the
trombleys.
her
life
was
almost
wholly
dependent
upon
the
trombleys.
the
testimony
shows,
according
to
mr.
trombley
now,
that
this
woman,
this
mrs.
werheyki,
came
to
him
in
a
distressed
state
of
mind
saying
that
dr.
freeman's
hearing
was
shortly
forthcoming
and
that
she
understood
that
she
was
going
to
have
to
testify
in
the
case
and
what
should
she
do?
would
the
lawyers
asked
her
questions
and
so
forth?
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
state
board
of
healing
arts
as
they
call
it.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
it's
really
the
med
--
state
medical
board.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
i'm
sure
it
did,
i'm
sure
it
did.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
well,
i
think
she
could've
been
subpoenaed.
i
suppose
if
she
wanted
to
exercise
her
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment,
she
could
have,
if
her
testimony
was
of
that
character,
but
otherwise
i
assume
she
was
subject
to
being
required
to
testify.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
i'm
sure
it
does,
mr.
justice.
under
those
circumstances,
this
woman
came
to
young,
mr.
trombley
who
was
a
member
of
the
bar,
not
long
but
was
a
member
of
the
bar,
and
asked
his
advice
as
to
what
she
should
do.
he
said
“tell
the
truth,”
and
so
she
then
went
back
to
dr.
freeman
and
said
that
she
understood
she
was
going
to
be
called
as
a
witness
in
his
hearing
and
she
was
going
to
tell
the
truth.
dr.
freeman
said
to
her
that
he
thought
that
would
be
unwise,
and
here
is
a
significant
shred
of
evidence.
he
said
“if
you
do
testify,
you
may
be
put
out
of
the
house
where
you
are
living.”
this
is
what
mr.
trombley
said
that
mrs.
werheyki
told
him
that
“you
may
be
put
out
of
the
trombley
house
that
your
reputation
will
be
ruined
and
other
derogatory
things
will
happen
to
you”
and
so,
she
came
back
and
reported
that
to
mr.
trombley
and
his
wife.
it
was
in
that
context
or
atmosphere
that,
about
two
days
later,
this
telephone
call
was
received
from
mr.
zipkin,
the
petitioner.
trombley
testified
and
it
was
his
testimony
that
was
believed
by
the
bar
board,
trombley
testified
that
this
telephone
call
came
in.
they
had
two
extensions
in
the
house.
his
wife
first
answered
the
phone
and
then
he
went
over
and
picked
up
the
telephone
and
it
was
zipkin
on
the
other
end
of
the
phone
and
he
said
“this
is
michael
zipkin.
i
am
helping
dr.
freeman
with
his
case
and
everything
is
getting
along
alright,
except
that
we
have
one
problem.
irene
werheyki
is
in
a
truth-telling
mood
and
i
think
that
you
and
mrs.
trombley
and
dr.
freeman
and
i
had
better
meet
and
discuss
this
subject
to
see
what
can
be
done
about
irene.”
it's
significant,
too,
that
not
just
mr.
trombley
who
was
a
young
lawyer,
and
i
think
might
have
some
special
sensibilities
about
what
should
be
done
under
those
circumstances,
he
reacted
violently,
but
so
did
his
wife
who
was
not
a
lawyer
at
all.
she
said
“we're
not
afraid
of
you,
zipkin.”
he
said
“are
you
trying
to
intimidate
a
witness?”
and,
under
those
circumstances,
the
conversation
was
broken
off
so
far
as
trombleys'
version
of
this
thing
is
concerned.
zipkin
--
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
i
think
--
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
the
thing,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
no,
but
i
think
that's
--
i
think
--
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
i
think
that's
fair.
zipkin
told
a
different
story
entirely
from
this.
his
version
of
the
thing
was
that
he
did
not
call
up
to
intimidate
a
witness.
he
denied
that
he
said
that
irene
was
in
a
truth-telling
mood
in
this
conversation.
what
he
said
that
he
said
over
the
telephone
was
this.
that
he
called
up
saying
that
he
had
heard
that
irene
was
going
to
charge
dr.
freeman
in
his
hearing
with
rape
or
sexual
relations
with
him
and
that
he
thought
that
the
trombleys
should
know
that
so
they
would
not
become
involved
in
the
mess
that
was
sure
to
follow
because
she
was
living
in
their
house.
that
was
what
he
said
on
one
occasion,
but
when
pressed
further
by
the
board
as
to
what
he
said
over
the
telephone,
he
changed
the
story
and
said
later
“well,
i
called
up
and
said
that
i
had
heard
that
irene
was
going
to
testify
in
the
freeman
hearing
and
that,
if
she
does,
you
will
become
involved
in
the
matter
because
she
is
living
in
your
home.”
he
denied
that
he
was
trying
to
intimidate
a
witness
when
he
called
but
it
is
significant
i
think,
too,
that
when
mr.
trombley
and
his
wife
both
reacted
violently
to
this
telephone
call,
he
said
he
didn't
just
stop,
having
given
them
the
warning
that
he
said
he
called
up
to
give
them,
but
he
said
“if
you
want
to
talk
with
me
or
with
dr.
freeman
about
this
matter,
if
you
will
call
me,
i
will
tell
you
what
i
heard.”
those,
if
the
court
please,
are
the
facts.
with
reference
to
this
issue
of
whether
mr.
zipkin,
the
petitioner,
tried
to
intimidate
a
witness
in
this
case.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
on
page
71,
if
the
court
please,
there
is
the
first
answer
that
mr.
zipkin
gave
with
reference
to
this
telephone
conversation.
it
is
a
long
answer.
it
covers
all
of
that
page
but
it
is
an
interesting
answer
and
one
that's
important
to
the
court,
i
think.
you
will
notice
there
that
on
three
different
occasions,
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
a
chance
to
tell
his
story,
three
different
times
in
that
long
answer,
he
said
that
he
had
heard
that
irene
werheyki
was
going
to
accuse
dr.
freeman
of
rape
or
sexual
immorality
and
that
he
was
calling
in
order
to
warn
the
trombleys
of
this
so
that
they
won't
become
so
involved.
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
the
privilege
of
reading
very
briefly
from
one
of
those
statements,
because
i
think
it
is
in
sharp
conflict
with
his
testimony
later
on.
at
one
point
in
this
long
answer
he
said
“i
said
--
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
page
71,
mr.
justice,
towards
the
bottom
of
the
page,
about
the
bottom-third.
“i
said
and
i
just
heard
irene
werheyki
is
going
to
accuse
dr.
freeman
of
rape
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
this
because
if
irene
gets
into
a
mess,
she
is
just
liable
to
drag
you
into
it.
she
lives
with
you”
and
so
on.
now,
if
the
court
please,
if
you
will
turn
to
page
87
of
the
record
where
the
petitioner
was
under
cross
--
under
examination
by
another
member
of
the
board
and
where
he
now
tells
another
version
of
this
telephone
conversation.
on
page
87,
about
a-third
of
the
way
down,
question,
“alright,
and
you
were
calling
the
trombleys,
as
i
understand
it,
to
inform
them
that
irene
was
going
to
testify
to
rape
and
sexual
intercourse,
although
i
also
understand
--
understood
you
to
say
you
were
confident
in
your
own
mind
that
irene
would
do
--
wouldn't
do
anything
like
that.”
answer,
“no.
i
called
the
trombleys
simply
to
tell
them
i
heard
irene
was
going
to
testify.
i
didn't
know
what
to”
and
then,
again,
he
stuck
by
this
from
now
on,
on
89
--
page
89,
he
--
they
say
here,
“do
you
remember
further
--
the
question,
“do
you
remember
further
testifying
that
knowledge
came
to
you
that
irene
werheyki
was
going
to
testify
that
she
was
involved
in
some
rape
and
sexual
immorality”
and
the
witness
then
started
to
interrupt
in
the
questioner,
the
board
member
said
“wait
a
minute.
did
you
testify
to
that
or
not?”
“yes.”
question,
“didn't
you
just
get
through
telling
mr.
syler,
another
board
member,
that
you
didn't
know
what
she
was
going
to
testify
to
before
you
called
trombley?
which
is
right,
did
you
or
didn't
you?”
answer,
“here
is
what
is
right.
i
called
up
the
trombleys
and
informed
them
of
exactly
what
i
heard.”
“what
did
you
hear?”
answer,
“that
irene
was
going
to
testify
against
freeman
at
his
hearing.
i
didn't
hear
what
about
or
what
the
charges
were,
i
had
no
idea.”
and
this
last,
and
then
i
will
not
burden
you
with
further
references
to
the
record,
one
of
the
members
of
the
board,
a
mr.
oliver,
dissented
from
the
finding
of
the
board
but
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
on
the
very
concluding
page
of
the
examination
of
the
petitioner,
that
mr.
oliver
thought
that
he
had
not
testified
candidly
before
the
board.
if
your
honors
would
turn
to
page
92
of
the
record,
the
very
last
thing
that
was
asked
the
petitioner
and
this
by
mr.
oliver.
in
the
middle
of
the
page
and
in
the
middle
of
his
question,
which
is
long,
“i
want
you
to
reflect
on
what
you
had
heard
and
what
you
actually
told
them
as
to
your
understanding
to
what
irene
was
going
to
testify
to.”
and
then,
answer,
“i
only
told
the
trombleys
one
thing,”
and
omitting
a
little,
“i
heard
that
irene
werheyki
--
i
heard
a
rumor
that
irene
werheyki
was
going
to
testify
at
this
hearing
of
dr.
freeman's.”
“so
that
i
understand
your
testimony,
it
is
that
you
did
not
tell
them
--
tell
that
you
had
also
heard
that
she
was
going
to
testify
that
she
had
been
raped
by
dr.
freeman
or
words
to
that
effect?”
“no
sir.”
and
then,
at
the
very
end
of
the
hearing,
this
comment
by
commissioner
oliver,
“well,
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
that
you
reflected
on
that
because
i
am
not
quite
sure
the
testimony
is
consistent
all
the
way
through”
and
so,
if
the
court
please,
it
is
our
position
here
that
there
are
two
issues
of
fact.
this
board
had
the
power
and
the
jurisdiction
to
determine
facts.
it
resolved
both
those
facts
against
the
petitioner,
namely
that
he
had
testified
falsely
with
reference
to
this
telephone
conversation
and,
second,
that
he
had
undertaken
or
attempted
to
intimidate
a
witness
in
the
freeman
hearing.
as
a
result
of
which,
the
board
concluded
that
the
petitioner
had
not
discharged
his
burden
of
proof
to
establish
that
he
was
of
good
moral
character.
now,
the
petitioner
here
has
relied
in
its
--
in
his
brief
heavily
upon
the
schware
and
the
first
konigsberg
cases
by
this
court
of
course.
may
i
say
that
those
cases
are
in
no
ways
applicable
to
the
present
case?
in
the
first
place,
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
or
bill
of
rights
case
at
all.
it
is
simply
a
question
of
whether
this
man
had
due
process
of
law.
is
there
any
rational
basis,
in
other
words,
for
the
finding
of
fact
that
was
made
by
the
board
in
missouri?
furthermore,
these
two
cases,
schware
and
konigsberg,
are
as
different
on
the
facts
these
cases
could
be.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes?
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
i
think
on
90
--
page
98,
mr.
justice
black,
you
will
find
the
findings
of
the
--
of
the
bar
board.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
well,
they
are
in
the
--
they
are
in
the
findings.
i
do
not
know
that
they
are
in
quite
that
concise
a
form,
but
if
you
--
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
--
the
findings
are
long
but
--
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
that's
alright.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes,
you
find,
i
think,
that
they
are
both
there
clearly
in
the
court
--
in
the
board's
findings.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
well,
that's
the
paragraph
that
i
had
in
mind.
they
find
there
that
the
applicant
did
attempt
to
influence
the
testimony
of
mrs.
werheyki
and
--
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
and
that
he
was
not
telling
the
truth,
yes.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes,
i
--
they
--
i
think
you
certainly
can
say
that
they're
in
the
paragraph,
although
they
may
not
be
quite
as
concise
as
they
might
be.
but,
if
i
may
return
to
just
a
brief
reference
to
the
schware
and
konigsberg
cases,
they
are
not
the
same
as
this
case
at
all
because
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
or
bill
of
rights
case.
the
testimony
in
both
of
those
cases
with
reference
to
the
moral
--
good
moral
character
of
the
man
who
is
applying
for
a
particular
bar
examination
was
infinitely
stronger
than
it
was
in
this
case.
there
was
no
question
in
either
of
those
cases
about
the
petitioner's
truthfulness
when
he
appeared
before
the
board.
in
fact,
the
court
commented
schware
upon
his
candid
--
candidness
in
revealing
the
fact
that,
many
years
before
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
there
was
no
issue
of
fact
before
the
local
board
there
with
reference
to
some
matter
of
substantial
importance
and,
furthermore
and
finally,
the
testimony
there
related
to
a
situation
15
years
before
whereas,
the
testimony
here
related
to
a
matter
that
was
quite
current
and,
in
fact,
his
appearance
--
the
petitioner's
appearance
before
the
board
and
whether
he
told
the
truth
was
a
matter
of
immediate
concern
to
the
board.
it
happened
in
their
very
presence.
and
so
if
the
court
please,
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
this
petitioner
has
received
due
process
of
law.
he
received
a
full
hearing
at
which
he
was
represented
by
counsel,
given
every
opportunity
to
bring
in
any
witnesses
that
he
had.
all
witnesses
were
heard
patiently
and,
finally,
at
the
end
of
the
hearing,
certain
com
--
certain
conclusions
of
fact
were
made
by
the
board,
on
the
basis
of
which,
they
entered
a
judgment
that
these
are
--
they
found,
rather,
that
this
man
had
not
established
that
he
was
of
good
moral
character.
i
think
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
well,
i
didn't
mention
that.
at
least
--
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
no.
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question,
mr.
justice.
i
didn't
mention
it.
it
did
not
occur
to
me
as
being
a
very
important
matter,
but
perhaps
it
will
strike
some
members
of
the
court
otherwise.
my
feeling
with
reference
to
that
is
this,
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
board
found
that
in
an
issue
of
fact
with
reference
to
whether
he
held
himself
out
to
be
a
lawyer
in
this
other
matter,
the
mere
fact
that
the
board
there
found
in
favor
of
the
petitioner,
but
found
in
another
issue
of
fact
with
reference
to
intimidating
a
witness
against
him
is
by
no
means
inconsistent
and
all
that
that
illustrates
really,
if
the
court
please,
is
this.
that
a
fact
finding
body
whether
it'd
be
a
court
or
a
board,
such
as
this,
that
can
see
the
witnesses,
see
their
demeanor
on
the
stand,
how
they
react
to
questions
that
are
put
to
them,
has
an
immense
advantage.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
that's
right.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
yes.
mr.
richmond
c.
coburn
that's
very
true.
that's
true,
mr.
justice,
and
one
other
thing,
and
i
think
this
is
--
this,
to
me,
would
be
important
if
i
were
sitting
on
this
board,
with
reference
to
his
--
representing
himself
to
be
a
lawyer,
he
did
not
testify
untruthfully
with
reference
to
that
at
all.
his
position
was
perfectly
consistent
all
the
way
through.
he
denied
holding
himself
out
as
a
lawyer.
all
he
said
was
“well,
i'm
a
law
student”
or
“i
know
more
about
the
law
than
you
do,”
but
with
reference
to
what
this
telephone
conversation,
where
he
was
found
to
have
tried
to
intimidate
a
witness,
his
testimony
is
strikingly
inconsistent.
and
so,
the
board,
i
think,
was
quite
authorized
in
deciding
against
him
on
that
issue
and
for
him
on
the
other
issue
of
fact.
thank
you
very
much.
