what
popular
--
i
ought
to
know,
but
i
don't,
--
what's
the
population
of
kansas
city?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
(inaudible)
of
the
university?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
seat
of
the
university?
justice
felix
frankfurter
high
i.q.
quotient
though.
high
i.q.
quo
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
all
been
through
that
experience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
proceeding
before
the
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
us
all
there
was,
so
far
as
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
done
on
--
printed?
is
it
all
printed
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
typewritten.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
brief?
no
oral
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
what
was
filed
was
--
was
there
a
lawyer?
were
you
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
whoever
represented
the
petitioner
was
a
lawyer,
wasn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
restricted
as
to
what
he
could
file?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
like
our
affirmance
of
an
appeal
on
the
printed
document
without
oral
argument,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
at
all
like
a
denial
of
a
facial
error
though.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
adjudication
by
the
supreme
court
with
full
power
of
review,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
set
me
straight,
mr.
davis.
after
this,
roughly
speaking,
certification,
the
board
action,
now
under
review,
followed,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
did
it
get
before
the
board
and
--
in
the
first
place,
who
certified
his
competence
to
take
the
bar
examination,
the
same
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
formal
authority
was
this
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
was
then
authorized
to
take
the
examination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then,
followed
this
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which,
as
it
were
nullified
that
formal
authorization
and
--
have
you
told
us,
if
you
have
i
was
inattentive,
i
didn't
mean
to
be.
how
was
this
new
proceeding
which
is
now
on
review
here,
how
did
it
get
going
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
he
got
around
to
taking
his
bar
examination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
he
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
acted
on
his
authorization.
he
took
his
bar
examination
and
then
there
was
a
complaint
contesting
his
moral
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
fitness
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
order
of
events?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
and,
you
indicated
that
the
board,
as
an
active
consciously
directed
body,
didn't
go
through
to
find
out
affirmatively
what
his
moral
character.
somebody
--
somebody
wrote
a
letter
to
somebody
the
way
you
want
to
get
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know,
but
it
wasn't
the
board
in
pauperis,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
when
a
cer
--
a
complaint
like
this
is
made
and
the
board
sat
as
roughly
speaking
as
adjudicating
body.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
second
time
or
even
the
first
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
initially,
you
can't
take
a
bar
examination
in
missouri
without
being
certified
to
be
of
good
moral
character.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
if
you
pass
it,
then
you're
admitted
and
you
don't
have
to
go
through
another
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
moral
character
examination
as
those
who
us
who
were
admitted
to
the
bar
of
new
york
had
to
go
through.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
