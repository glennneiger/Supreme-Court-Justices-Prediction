john
m.
harlan
there's
no
suggestion,
i
take
it,
that
he
was
flunked
on
his
examinations
because
a
complaint
had
been
filed
against
him.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
suggestion
of
that
kind.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
issue,
then,
is
out
of
the
case,
everything
you've
been
talking
about
up
to
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
representation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
you
flunk
the
first
time,
you
have
to
get
permission
to
take
the
bar
exams
again,
do
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
the
--
but
you
can't
take
the
--
if
you
flunk
once,
you
can't
take
it
automatically.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh!
can
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
i
don't
understand
how
the
committee
gets
anything.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
character
committee
examination
normally
is
after
you've
passed
your
bar
exam.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
when
does
that
--
at
what
stage
is
the
character
committee?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh!
initially?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
either
time.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
rule,
does
this
preclude
this
young
man
from
reapplying
at
some
stage
for
permission
to
take
the
bar
examination?
