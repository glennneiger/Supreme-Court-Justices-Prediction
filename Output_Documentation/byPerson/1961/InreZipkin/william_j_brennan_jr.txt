justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
first
amendment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
complication
below
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
usual
practice
of
the
supreme
court
of
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
the
nature
of
the
proceeding,
a
motion
for
judicial
review.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
the
new
procedure
contemplate
an
independent
examination
of
the
record
by
the
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apparently,
at
least
in
this
occasion,
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apparently,
they
didn't
exercise
it
in
their
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
independent
discretion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
--
what
was
sent
up
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
sent
up
to
the
court
with
the
motion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
i
mean,
was
the
record
of
the
transcript
of
this
procedure
sent
up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
any
event,
you're
not
raising
any
question
with
us
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
review
procedure,
are
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
as
far
it
appears,
in
any
event,
we
don't
know
whether
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
ever
looked
at
the
record
or
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
mind
just
reading
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
they
did
look
at
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
a
sort
of
thompson-louisville
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
trombley
told
some
other
lawyer,
didn't
he
in
thompson?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
coburn.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
how
is
the
board
appointed?
is
this
--
do
you
have
any
--
the
integrated
bar,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
terms
of
office?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
members?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
members
of
the
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
five,
from
various
parts
of
the
state
under
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
us
anything,
mr.
coburn,
the
scope
of
review
by
the
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
findings
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
if
treated
as
the
lower
court,
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then
i
--
that
review
would
be
on
the
part
of
the
supreme
court,
only
an
examination
of
the
transcript
will
see
if
there
is
evidence
--
substantial
evidence
or
something
to
support
the
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
new
rule,
has
this
changed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
coburn,
isn't
that
at
page
98,
aren't
the
two
findings
expressed
just
as
such
in
that
paragraph
beginning
based
on
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
he
was
not
telling
the
truth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
placed
that
as
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
due
finding
of
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
excuse
me
mr.
coburn.
i
am
right,
am
i
not,
that
there
were
other
witnesses
on
the
business
of
representing
himself
with
an
attorney
who
said
that
he
did
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that,
this
is
--
even
though
there
was
evidence
in
addition
to
his
testimony
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
that
issue
as
there
was
not
on
this
other
one.
