mr.
heywood
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
schware,
first,
konigsberg
type
case.
the
issue
is
relatively
clear-cut.
whether
commissioner
--
whether
petitioner
has
been
denied
permission
to
take
the
missouri
bar
examination
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
there
is
no
rational
justification
in
the
record
for
the
finding
of
the
missouri
board
of
law
examiners
that
petitioner
is
not
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
there
is
no
first
amendment
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
correct.
the
facts
are
more
involved.
in
june
of
1960
at
the
age
of
25,
petitioner,
michael
zipkin
from
kansas
city,
graduated
from
the
university
of
missouri
law
school.
he
had
previously
been
investigated
twice
as
to
his
moral
character
by
regional
bar
committees
and
twice
found
to
be
of
good
moral
character,
once,
when
he
filed
his
law
student
registration
form
and,
later,
when
he
filed
to
take
the
missouri
bar
examination.
he
took
the
missouri
bar
in
june
of
1960
but
did
not
pass.
while
the
papers
were
being
graded,
however,
a
complaint
was
raised
against
him
and,
when
the
results
of
the
bar
examination
were
announced,
petitioner
was
advised
that
if
he
wanted
to
take
a
second
bar
exam,
the
board
would
have
to
inquire
further
as
to
his
character.
the
petitioner
advised
the
board
that
he
did
want
to
take
a
second
examination
and
the
board
advised
him
that
the
hearing
would
be
held
and
that
the
hearing
would
be
particularly
directed
to
the
questions
of
whether
he
had
held
himself
out
as
an
attorney
in
connection
with
a
certain
divorce
litigation
between
a
mr.
and
mrs.
baurichter
in
columbia,
missouri
and
whether
he
had
influenced
or
attempted
to
influence
witnesses
at
the
hearing
before
the
state
board
of
healing
arts
of
a
dr.
freeman,
a
columbia,
missouri
psychiatrist.
the
board
of
healing
arts
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that
is
correct.
he
failed
the
bar
exam
and
this
has
to
do
only
as
to
his
moral
character.
the
state
board
of
healing
arts
hearing
on
dr.
freeman
was
held
in
june
of
1960
and
resulted
in
dr.
freeman's
license
being
revoked
for
unprofessional
conduct.
petitioner's
hearing
was
held
in
columbia
on
october
of
1960,
as
scheduled.
the
witnesses
who
testified
were
six,
the
board
subpoenaed
plus
mrs.
baurichter,
the
individual
involved
in
the
divorce
litigation,
and
petitioner,
himself.
carl
sapp,
the
first
board
witness,
a
columbia,
missouri
attorney,
testified
that
he'd
known
petitioner
casually
for
six
or
seven
months.
that,
while
he
was
not
acquainted
with
his
reputation,
“his
conversation
and
conduct
at
the
times
that
i
have
seen
and
talked
to
him
have
been
above
reproach
and
he
has
conducted
himself
as
a
gentleman
in
my
presence”
and,
mr.
sapp
said
that
he
would
sign
a
character
affidavit
for
petitioner.
mr.
sapp
also
testified
that
he
represented
dr.
freeman
at
his
hearing,
that
he
never
requested
petitioner
to
interview
witnesses
or
obtain
statements
and
that,
to
his
knowledge,
petitioner
had
never
done
so.
mr.
sapp
said
the
petitioner
never
played
a
part
in
the
freeman
hearing.
mr.
sapp
also
testified
regarding
events
related
to
a
divorce
proceeding
filed
by
his
client,
mrs.
baurichter,
who
was
a
patient
of
dr.
freeman's
against
her
husband
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
correct,
mr.
justice,
just
about
everyone.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
stap
--
sapp
stated
that
there
was
considerable
community
feeling
in
columbia
by
reason
of
the
freeman
hearing
and
the
baurichter
divorce
proceeding
and
that,
in
june
of
1960,
there
were
rumors
all
over
the
community
about
dr.
freeman
and
ada
margaret
baurichter,
most
of
which
were
believed
whether
there
was
evidence
or
not.
mr.
sapp
said
that
the
issue
of
petitioner's
character
at
this
law
examiner's
hearing
was
very
much
tied
in
with
the
community
feeling
toward
dr.
freeman
and
mrs.
baurichter.
the
second
board
witness,
mr.
baurichter
testified
that
he'd
known
petitioner
probably
a
year,
that
he
had
been
on
friendly
terms
with
him,
and
had
good
relations
with
his
friends,
that
petitioner
had
been
a
guest
in
the
baurichter
home,
and
that
he
saw
no
reason
to
see
otherwise
than
that
petitioner
was
a
person
of
good
reputation.
mr.
baurichter
also
testified
that
he
was
estranged
from
his
wife,
that
petitioner
and
mrs.
baurichter
had
come
out
to
the
home
at
the
time
mrs.
baurichter
moved
out
since
petitioner
helped
her
move
some
furniture,
that
petitioner
later
came
out
with
mrs.
baurichter
to
take
an
inventory
which
mr.
sapp
wanted
and
that,
on
this
latter
occasion,
petitioner
made
the
statement
that
“i
think
i
know
a
little
more
about
it
than
you
do.
i
am
a
lawyer.”
mr.
baurichter's
hired
hand,
james
earl
grant,
the
third
board
witness,
testified
to
the
same
effect
as
to
the
attorney
representation
charge.
it
can
be
noted
at
this
point,
however,
that
mrs.
baurichter
and
petitioner
both
denied
that
any
such
attorney
representation
was
made,
testifying
to
the
effect
that
petitioner
said
“i
possibly
know
more
of
the
law
than
you
do”
or
words
to
that
effect.
in
any
event,
this
testimonial
variance
became
inconsequential
because
the
board
of
law
examiners
in
their
opinion
expressly
found
that
petitioner
was
not
disqualified
on
the
ground
that
he
had
held
himself
out
as
an
attorney.
the
fourth
board
witness
was
professor
edmond
r.
anderson.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
the
issue
as
to
the
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
--
attorney
representation
charge,
that
is
correct,
but
it
ties
in
with
this
whole
question,
mr.
justice
harlan
and,
therefore,
i
mentioned
it.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
correct.
professor
anderson
testified
that
he
had
known
petitioner
over
two
years,
that
he
knew
him
as
a
student
and
socially,
that
he
thought
petitioner
met
the
requirements
for
admittance
to
the
missouri
bar
and
the
petitioner
was
fit
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar.
professor
anderson
also
testified
that
petitioner's
reputation
for
character
and
truthfulness
was
good
and
that
everybody
that
i
know
whose
judgment
i
would
respect
around
here
has
also
thought
well
of
michael
zipkin
and,
in
kansas
city
where
i
understand
he
lives
now,
former
students
of
mine
speak
well
of
him.
professor
anderson
also
testified
that
his
wife
had
been
a
patient
of
dr.
freeman
and
that
dr.
freeman's
hearing
before
the
state
board
of
healing
arts
was
widely
publicized
and
discussed
in
conversations
and
by
rumors
in
the
area.
the
fifth
board
witness
was
dean
joseph
covington
of
the
missouri
law
school.
he
testified
that
he
knew
petitioner
only
in
his
capacity
a
dean
--
as
dean,
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
his
reputation.
that,
in
regard
to
the
requirements
of
character
and
fitness,
he
had
no
knowledge
that
would
prevent
petitioner
from
being
a
member
of
the
bar
and
that,
as
far
as
the
law
school's
records
indicated,
petitioner
was
--
had
good
grades
and
good
background.
mr.
baurichter
testified
she'd
known
petitioner
approximately
a
year-and-a
half,
that
she
became
acquainted
with
him
when
they
were
both
patients
of
dr.
freeman
and
participated
in
certain
group
activities
that
dr.
freeman
stimulated,
that
petitioner
was
very
highly
spoken
of,
and
that
she
would
say
his
reputation
was
good.
michael
j.
trombley,
the
sixth
board
witness,
was
the
main
one
against
petitioner.
he
had
received
his
law
degree
in
missouri
in
february
of
1960,
the
semester
before
petitioner
graduated.
and
he
testified
that
he
first
became
acquainted
with
petitioner
when
they
were
freshmen
in
law
school,
that
they
were
then
on
friendly
terms,
close
friends
at
one
time,
that
they
talked
a
lot
and
did
things
together,
and
that
they
had
been
in
dr.
freeman's
home
along
with
mrs.
trombley,
the
witness'
wife,
and
the
bauritchters,
and
that
they
have
not
associated
together,
petitioner
and
trombley,
as
they
once
did
because,
well,
primarily
over
this
dr.
freeman
deal.
trombley
explained
that
he
and
his
wife
had
been
patients
of
dr.
freeman
at
one
time
and
were
in
association
with
him
that
--
the
situation
came
up
where
a
lot
of
things
were
being
questioned.
he,
dr.
freeman,
was
acting
in
a
questionable
manner
and
so
forth
at
which
time,
we
broke
off
relationship
with
dr.
freeman.
trombley
stated
that
petitioner
came
over
to
the
trombley
home
twice
after
that,
that
they
talked
about
dr.
freeman
and
that
their
friendship
just
ended
right
there.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
he
was
a
psychiatrist,
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
there's
nothing
more
than
that
in
the
record.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
correct.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
did
believe
in
group
therapy
and
various
witnesses
testified
as
to
social
events,
roller
skating,
parties,
and
that
sort
of
thing
that
his
patients
had.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
it
would
appear
that
way.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
kansas
city?
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
kansas
city,
about
500,000,
columbia
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
i
would
say
--
mr.
coburn
says
about
35,000.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
it
is
the
seat
of
the
university
of
missouri
and
two
other
educational
institutions,
relatively
small
educational
town.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
very
definitely.
trombley
testified
that
the
break
between
petitioner
and
himself
had
nothing
to
do
with
petitioner's
character
that
it
was
more
his
association
with
dr.
freeman.
trombley
further
testified
that
he
and
his
wife
employed
a
housekeeper
by
the
name
of
irene
werhey
who
lived
in
an
apartment
in
their
basement
and,
yes,
who
was
also
a
patient
of
dr.
freeman
and
had
been
for
over
a
year.
that,
while
she
was
under
treatment
from
him,
she
was
informed
that
she
was
to
appear
against
him
at
this
hearing
of
his,
that
she
was
very
confused
and
asked
trombley
what
she
should
do,
and
trombley
told
her
that
she
should
tell
the
truth.
irene,
the
housekeeper,
then
went
to
dr.
freeman,
according
to
trombley's
testimony,
and
told
dr.
freeman
that
she
was
going
to
be
called
at
his
hearing,
that
she
was
going
to
tell
the
truth,
and
dr.
freeman
told
her
that
that
would
not
be
wise,
this,
all
according
to
the
testimony
of
witness
trombley.
trombley
testified
that,
within
a
few
days
after
that
and
before
the
freedman
hearing,
a
call
came
in
from
petitioner
that
mrs.
trombley
first
answered
the
telephone
and
that
he
answered
a
few
minutes
or
a
few
seconds
later
on
an
extension
and
that
everybody
was
speaking.
trombley
testified
as
to
the
substance
of
the
conversation
as
follows
and,
here,
with
the
court's
permission,
i'll
read
from
page
10
of
the
petitioner's
brief
where
the
record
is
quoted.“
sir,
mr.
zipkin
was
talking
to
my
wife
when
i
picked
up
the
receiver.
he
mentioned
the
fact
that
he
was
helping
dr.
freeman
with
his
case
and
that
things
were
looking
well
and
that
there
was
some
new
material
or
something
new
had
come
up
but
there
was
a
problem
in
that
irene,
i
mean,
mrs.
werhey
was
in
a
truth-telling
mood
and
that
she
felt
--
he
felt
that
my
wife
and
i
should
meet
with
he
and
dr.
freeman
to
see
what
could
be
done
about
mrs.
werhey.”
question:
“now,
was
there
any
further
conversation
other
than
that?”
“well,
i
think
that
this
time,
i
interjected
and
my
wife
had
been
doing
all
the
talking.
i
said
‘are
you
trying
to
intimidate
a
witness?
what
is
going
on?'
he
said
‘i
think
it
would
be
better
for
everybody
all
the
way
around
if
we
met
and
decided
what
to
do
with
mrs.
werhey.'”
trombley
testified
that
he
gratuitously
represented
two
of
the
witnesses
at
the
freeman
hearing,
including
ms.
irene,
the
housekeeper
but
that,
after
the
telephone
call
by
petitioner,
he
had
no
further
conversations
with
petitioner
with
reference
to
dr.
freeman's
hearing,
that
he
had
no
knowledge
that
petitioner
ever
approached
irene
personally
either
before
or
after
the
telephone
conversation.
and,
in
fact,
in
response
to
a
board
member's
question
as
to
what
in
particular
caused
him
to
accuse
petitioner
of
attempting
to
influence
a
witness,
trombley
replied
“i
sort
of
maybe
jumped
to
conclusions,
but
you
take
the
preceding
incident
that
i
discussed
that
irene
had
told
me
about
and
connected
it
with
this
incident.”
when
asked
about
petitioner's
reputation
for
voracity
and
morality,
trombley
replied
“i
don't
think
it
is
particularly
good.”
after
stating
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
this
during
the
last
few
months
of
their
relationship
and
that
he
had
no
opinion
in
1959,
trombley
admitted,
upon
further
questioning,
that
he
had
been
a
character
witness
for
petitioner
in
his
1959
divorce
case
and
that
he
had
then
testified
that
petitioner's
reputation
in
the
community
for
voracity
and
morality
was
good.
the
final
witness
was
petitioner,
himself.
he
testified
that
he
was
introduced
to
dr.
freeman
by
the
trombleys
in
december
of
1958.
that
he,
thereafter,
became
a
patient
of
dr.
freeman,
that
he
went
to
him
because
of
his
mari
--
of
his
own
marital
difficulties
and
because
he
was
having
difficulty
concentrating
on
his
studies.
petitioner
testified
that,
at
that
time,
“trombley
was
the
closest
friend
i
ever
had
that
i
considered
mr.
and
mrs.
trombley
to
be
very
close.”
petitioner
and
trombley,
petitioner
testified,
sat
together
in
the
law
classes,
helped
each
other
with
their
examinations.
trombley
had
been
a
witness
at
petitioner's
divorce
proceeding
and
trombley
had
been
instrumental
in
getting
petitioner
a
place
to
live
at
the
house
of
the
legal
fraternity
to
which
petitioner
did
not
belong
after
his
divorce.
as
to
what
precipitated
the
rift
between
them,
petitioner
stated
that
trombley
developed
an
almost
fanatical
hatred
of
dr.
freeman,
that
when
the
trombleys
separated
from
dr.
freeman,
petitioner
did
his
best
to
maintain
his
friendship
both
with
the
trombleys
and
dr.
freeman
but
that,
gradually,
this
became
impossible.
that,
every
time
he
went
over
to
the
trombleys
even
to
comfort
him
after
trombley's
bar
exam,
trombley
would
go
and
do
--
and
harangued
about
dr.
freeman,
and
that
the
telephone
conversation
just
ended
anything.
petitioner
testified
that
“trombley
just
got
mad
at
me
because
i
was
seeing
dr.
freeman.”
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
no,
your
honor.
he
passed
the
bar.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
well,
he
went
over
to
comfort
him
after
he
took
it
before
the
results
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
--
were
announced.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
yes,
sir.
petitioner
testified
that
he
called
the
trombley
home
about
a
month
before
the
freeman
hearing,
that
he
did
so
as
a
friendly
gesture
because
he
had
heard
that
irene,
the
housekeeper
in
their
home,
was
going
to
testify
against
dr.
freeman
at
his
hearing,
that
mrs.
trombley
had
once
told
petitioner
that
they,
the
trombleys,
couldn't
stand
all
this
gossip
about
dr.
freeman
and
that
he
just
called
them
to
tell
them
something
he
didn't
know
they
knew.
petitioner
denied
that
he
used
any
words
such
as
“truth-telling
mood”
and
stated
that
there
was
no
intimidation
involved
in
the
phone
call.
with
both
of
the
trombleys
yelling
at
him,
however,
and
mr.
trombley
accusing
him
of
attempting
to
intimidate
a
witness,
petitioner
testified
that
he
said
“well,
if
you
want
to
get
together
with
me
and
talk
about
this
or
with
me
and
dr.
freeman
at
a
later
date,
i'll
do
so.”
petitioner
testified
that
he
did
not
talk
with
dr.
freeman
or
anyone
about
making
the
call
to
the
trombleys,
that
he
never
even
told
dr.
freeman
that
he
did
so
and
that
he
never
talked
to
irene
about
anything
connected
with
the
freeman
hearing.
in
february
of
1961,
the
board
of
law
examiners
filed
their
opinion
that
petitioner
was
not
a
person
of
good
moral
character
and
should
not
be
allowed
to
take
a
second
bar
examination.
one
of
the
five
board
members
dissented.
the
board
threw
out
the
attorney
representation
charge,
finding
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
it.
on
the
witness
intimidation
charge,
however,
the
board
found
against
the
petitioner.
the
board
said,
i
am
referring
to
page
17
of
petitioner's
brief,
based
on
the
record
of
the
hearing
before
the
board,
therefore,
it
is
the
finding
of
the
board
that
applicant,
michael
zipkin
did
attempt
to
influence
the
testimony
of
irene
werhey
by
approaching
mr.
and
mrs.
trombley
with
the
suggestions
as
testified
to
by
trombley,
that
applicant,
michael
zipkin,
was
not
telling
the
truth
in
his
testimony
before
the
board
with
regard
to
what
he
said
in
the
telephone
conversation
to
mr.
and
mrs.
trombley
and
as
to
whether
or
not
he
knew
when
he
telephoned
them
that
mrs.
werhey
was
going
to
testify
as
to
sexual
relations
with
freeman.
the
board
summarized
the
testimony
regarding
petitioner's
character
and
reputation
and
comment,
here
again
on
page
18,
“even
though
it
might
be
said
that
the
evidence
preponderates
in
favor
of
the
reputation
of
the
applicant
for
good
character,
yet,
the
general
reputation
would
have
to
yield
in
deciding
this
matter
to
the
specific
act
and
facts
with
regard
to
the
telephone
conversation
above
set
out
as
the
determinative
factor.”
petitioner
filed
a
motion
for
judicial
review
in
the
missouri
supreme
court
urging,
among
other
things,
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
the
missouri
supreme
court,
without
oral
argument,
summarily
affirmed
the
board's
order.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
as
far
as
i
know,
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
was
the
first
time
that
a
case
such
as
this
had
come
up
in
missouri
and
there
was
no
established
practice,
and
that's
why
motion
for
judicial
review
almost
in
the
nature
of
a
certiorari
petition
to
this
court
was
filed
with
the
missouri
supreme
court.
the
board
of
law
examiners
does
recommend
to
the
state
supreme
court
their
findings,
and
then
the
court
itself
of
course
has
the
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that
was
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
in
this
instant.
since
this
case
in
the
missouri
supreme
court,
there
has
been
a
new
rule
adopted
which
specifically
spells
out
a
procedure
for
review
giving
a
bar
applicant
a
certain
period
of
time
to
file
any
motion
with
the
missouri
supreme
court
taking
exception
to
any
finding
of
the
board
of
law
examiners.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
other
than
that
the
court,
of
course,
has
the
final
determination
and
obligation
to
determine
the
fitness
of
applicants
for
the
bar.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
in
this
instance
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
in
this
instance,
other
than
in
a
summary
order
stating
that
they
reviewed
the
record
and
the
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
--
exceptions.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
the
papers?
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
the
record
was
sent
up
and
various
specific
points
urged
in
the
motion
why
the
case
should
be
overruled,
weight
of
the
evidence,
and
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
that
sort
of
thing,
along
with
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
the
state
supreme
court?
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
well,
i
know
the
documents
that
were
filed
with
the
missouri
supreme
court
and
the
parts
of
those
that
relate
to
the
federal
constitutional
question
are
contained
in
the
brief
--
in
the
record.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
no,
it
was
typewritten.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
it
was
typewritten.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
no
brief
was
ever
filed
except
there,
along
with
this
motion
for
judicial
review,
there
were
suggestions
in
the
nature
of
federal
court
suggestions
which
constituted
a
brief.
no
brief
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
no,
i
was
not
in
the
case
at
that
time.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
there
was
a
lawyer
at
that
time,
yes.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
no,
not
in
any
way
and
he
filed
a
brief
rather
full
brief
was
filed,
but
no
response
was
ever
filed
and
no
argument
was
ever
had.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
no,
your
honor.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
well,
they
stated
in
their
opinion.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
they
did.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
at
the
record
page
118.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
now,
at
this
day,
the
court,
having
considered
the
transcript,
record,
and
files
herein
and
the
motion
for
judicial
review
and
exceptions
from
the
findings
and
orders
of
the
state
board
of
law
examiners,
finds
that
said
order
is
supported
by
competent
and
substantial
evidence
on
the
whole
record
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
we,
therefore,
considered
and
the
judge--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
oh!
yes,
yes,
they
did
have
the
record
before
them.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
i
would
think
so.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
oh!
no,
no.
i
--
when
i
did
refer
to
hat,
mr.
justice,
i
only
meant
that
the
motion
that
was
filed
seemed
to
be
in
the
--
by
petitioner
in
the
nature
of
a
request
for
judicial
review
because
there
was
no
question
at
that
time
in
missouri.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that
is
correct.
petitioner
submits
that
there
is
no
rational
justification
in
the
record
for
the
finding
of
the
missouri
board
of
law
examiners.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
the
sole
contention.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
we
have
cited
that
case,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
it's
more
schware-konigsberg
type
of
argument.
we
don't
claim
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
their
finding
that
he's
lacking
in
good
moral
character.
we
do
claim
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
does
not
rationally
justify
the
finding
of
the
board
of
law
examiners
and
rationally
justifying,
of
course,
is
the
language
of
this
court
in
both
schware
and
konigsberg.
missouri
supreme
court
rule
8.07,
which
appears
on
page
21
of
our
brief,
states
in
part
that
in
no
event
will
permission
be
granted
to
register
as
a
law
student
or
to
take
the
bar
examination
until
an
investigation
as
the
moral
character
has
been
completed.
two
such
investigations
were
made
in
this
case
and
petitioner
was
twice
found
to
be
of
good
moral
character.
thus,
at
the
time
the
attorney
representation
charge
and
the
witness
intimidation
charge
were
raised
against
him,
he
had
fulfilled
his
burden
of
proof
and
had
established
a
prima
facie
case,
and
the
board
never
overcame
this,
the
petitioner
submits.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
i
would
say
yes,
the
same
board.
the
actual
investigation
had
been
made
by
a
regional
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
to
take
the
bar
exam,
and
did
take
it.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
well,
a
complaint
was
made.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
no,
after
--
after
he
took
the
bar
examination
and
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
while
the
papers-
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
moral
char
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
well,
there
were
actual
investigations
made
by
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
no.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
you
may
take
it
a
second
time
without
any
additional
fee,
as
i
understand
it,
and,
as
a
routine
matter,
this
is
frequently
done.
however,
at
the
time
they
advised
petitioner
of
the
results
of
the
bar
exam,
they
told
him
that
if
he
did
want
to
take
a
second
examination,
they
would
have
to
have
a
further
inquiry
as
to
his
good
moral
character,
and
that
was
the
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
yes,
you
can.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
the
following
--
following
session.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
well,
because
they
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
not
in
missouri,
mr.
justice.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
prior
to
the
time
you
were
allowed
to
take
the
bar
examination.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
and,
the
rules
of
the
missouri
court
specifically
provide
that
in
no
event
will
you
be
allowed
to
take
an
examination
until
the
moral
character
investigation
has
been
completed.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
the
efforts
were
made
to
find
out
which
do
appear
in
the
record
but
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
he
reported
that
to
--
he
reported
the
telephone
incident
to
the
lawyer
for
the
board
of
healing
arts
in
charge
of
the
dr.
freeman
hearing.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
mr.
justice
black,
with
the
court's
permission,
i'll
reserve
the
minute
or
so
of
my
time
left.
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
matter
of
this
inconsistency,
the
only
real
inconsistency
that
appears
on
this
record,
and
it's
an
inconsistency
that
we
have
admitted
in
our
brief,
is
that
petitioner
first
testified
that
he
said
“i
heard
that
irene
was
going
to
testify
against
dr.
freeman
about
rape
or
sexual
relations,”
whereas,
he
later
said
“i
only
heard
that
she
was
going
to
testify
against
dr.
freeman.”
now,
petitioner
submits
that
this
inconsistency
as
to
what
he
heard
some
five
months
prior
to
the
time
of
this
board
hearing,
considering
particularly
all
the
rumors
and
talk
that
was
going
on
about
this
general
matter
is
not
a
consistency
that
warrants
the
conclusion
of
the
board
of
bar
examiners
that
he
was
not
telling
the
truth
or
is
of
unfit
character
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
the
petitioner
submits
that
even
assuming
that
trombley's
version
of
the
telephone
call
is
correct,
that
even
assuming
that
what
was
said
on
the
telephone
that
that
doesn't
form
a
basis
--
a
substantial
basis
from
which
you
can
draw
a
legal
conclusion
that
that
constituted
an
attempt
to
intimidate
a
witness
--
mr.
heywood
h.
davis
we
say
that
even
accepting
trombley's
version
of
the
phone
call
and
wholly
apart
from
the
fact
that
petitioner
testified
to
the
contrary
that
that
is
not
a
basis
from
which
you
can
draw
the
conclusion
that
that
did
constitute
such
an
attempt.
the
14
lines
of
testimony
that
i
read
yesterday
in
which
mr.
coburn
referred
to
as
to
this
one
telephone
conversation,
one
single
controverted
telephone
conversation.
