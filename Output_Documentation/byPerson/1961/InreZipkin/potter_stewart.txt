everybody
sounds
as
to
being
a
patient
of
this
doctor's.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
certainly,
all
the
--
everybody
involved
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
in
the
case
insofar
as
you're
going
to
argue
that
they
couldn't
--
the
board
could
not
have
consistently
decided
that
question
that
way
and
the
question
that's
--
that
is
here,
the
way
they
did
decide
it,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
dr.
freeman
--
i
know
he's,
i
gather
he's
a
psychiatrist.
was
he
a
psychoanalyst
or
what
was
he?
justice
potter
stewart
some
indication
that
he
believed
in
group
therapy.
justice
potter
stewart
it
must
have
been
big
parties.
as
i
said,
[laughter]
the
whole
town
seems
to
be
his
patient.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
in
kansas
city.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
oral
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
up
until
this
case
it
--
the
ground
rules
of
procedure
had
not
been
very
well
delineated.
does
this
mean
that
there
had
been
no
--
no
case
like
this
before
this
one?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
dr.
freeman's
hearing
was
to
be
before
a
board
called
the,
what?
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
state
board
of
healing
arts?
justice
potter
stewart
did
that
--
does
that
board
have
subpoena
power?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
--
because
as
the
record
indicates
that
there
was
some
--
that
mrs.
trom
--
that
mrs.
werheyki,
or
whatever
her
name
was,
had
some
choice
as
to
whether
or
not
to
appear
and
testify.
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
--
it
does
have
subpoena
power.
