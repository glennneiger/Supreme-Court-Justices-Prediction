justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
bother
you
--
would
it
bother
you
--
you
said
when
he
was
tried
as
a
recidivist,
would
it
bother
you
if
you
would
state
just
exactly
how
he
was
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
denial
of
the
fact
that
he
has
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
why,
why
did
--
what
facts
were
omitted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
state
raise
any
objection
on
that
ground?
was
there
a
ruling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
there
was
no
chance
to
amend
on
account
of
a
ruling
to
dismiss
the
petition
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
we
know
about
the
reason
he
dismissed
the
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
rule
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
when
a
person
comes
before
them
asked
to
be
admitted
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis?
does
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
require
him
to
allege
that
he
is
indigent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
do
that
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
do
that
in
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
allegation?
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
page
15,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
does
it
say
he's
indigent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
isn't
this
the
whole
request
he
made
to
the
state
to
fill
out
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
he
allege
he
was
indigent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
so
material,
why
isn't
it
in
the
record?
is
that
--
do
you
mean
as
jurisdictional
and
it's
not
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
you
know
that
this
didn't
show
that
this
--
this
jurisdictional
fact
was
absent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
admit
it
--
you
admitted
all
along,
but
you
say
he
cannot
proceed
unless
he
said
he's
indigent
on
this
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
why
the
--
this
court
would
hold
that
that's
a
vital,
crucial,
fatal
thing
in
a
petition
to
the
district
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
proceed
on
a
statement
where
he
doesn't
say
he's
indigent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
in
the
record
that's
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
here
on
--
printed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
a
dismissal
on
the
merits
or
an
opinion
which
discussed
the
merits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
it's
our
duty
to
try
to
find
out
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
had
a
view
that
was
trying
to
conceal
from
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
ordinarily,
we
like
to
have
another
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
their
(voice
overlap)
if
their
reason
for
the
action
of
the
lower
court
and
those
in
the
judgment
is
affirmed
because
it's
a
right,
i
would
assume
that
neither
the
court
of
virginia
doesn't
want
to
play
hocus-pocus
even
with
indigent
defendants
or
defendants
who
are
jail.
