justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
meador,
let's
see
if
i
follow
you.
there's
only
a
single
official
line
of
the
executive
of
the
department
being
the
director
of
the
welfare
or
whatever
it
is
who
may
initiate
this
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
secondly,
if
it
is
initiated,
the
sentence
may
have
been
imposed
in
some
remote
county
from
virginia
--
from
richmond
by
another
judge
i
gather
and
that
the
judge
who
imposes
the
enhanced
punishment
is
one
of
the
judges
sitting
in
richmond,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
this
unique?
in
other
words,
it's
not
the
sentencing
judge.
i
gather
there's
initial
sentence
imposed,
is
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
and
that
it
comes
to
richmond
as
being
an
enhancement
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
the
application
of
the
director?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
reason
he
gave
was
that
there
was
no
merit
for
the
right
to
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought,
i
thought
--
am
i
wrong
about
this
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong
apparently
despite
the
omission
which
you
say
was
in
the
petition
before
him,
that
there
was
an
omission,
despite
that
he
went
ahead
and
decided
the
constitutional
point
on
the
premise
that
in
fact
at
a
recidivist
trial
it
had
been
understood
that
he
was
representing
to
this
court.
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
say
he
does
but
it
would
--
he
go
--
he
went
ahead
and
decided
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
can
i
complete
the
question,
which
was
he
was
not
have
had
the
reach
if
in
fact
the
man
were
not
an
indigent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.

doesn't

he
doesn't
(inaudible)

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
has
jurisdiction

not,
on
this
habeas
corpus
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
was
entitled
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
believe
--
obviously
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

he
had
the
jurisdictional

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
has
no
argument
on
the

or

argument
on
that
ground.

law.
