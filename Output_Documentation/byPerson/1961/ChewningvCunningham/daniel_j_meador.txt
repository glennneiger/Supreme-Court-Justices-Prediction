mr.
daniel
j.
meador
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
case,
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
the
petitioner
is
confined
in
the
virginia
penitentiary
under
a
10-year
sentence
imposed
upon
him
under
the
state's
recidivist
law
which
is
section
53-296
of
the
code.
that
section
provides
for
a
separate,
independent
judicial
hearing
on
the
recidivist
charge.
it
empowers
a
trial
judge
on
finding
three
valid
trial
penitentiary
sentences
to
make
a
decision
whether
any
further
imprisonment
is
called
for,
if
so,
what
is
the
appropriate
sentence
for
any
number
of
years
up
to
life
imprisonment.
the
question
here
in
this
case
is
whether
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
a
prisoner,
an
indigent
prisoner
without
a
lawyer,
has
a
right
to
the
assistance
of
court-appointed
counsel
at
this
recidivist
trial.
the
case
here
was
commenced
below
by
tuning
in
the
law
and
equity
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
by
the
filing
of
a
habeas
corpus
petition.
this
petitioner
has
been
denied
all
the
way
up
in
the
virginia
courts
without
a
response,
without
any
hearing,
so
we
take
the
facts
here
set
out
in
the
petition
and
in
the
attached
exhibits
as
true.
those
facts
show
that
the
following
occurred.
in
june
1958,
the
petitioner
was
confined
in
the
virginia
penitentiary
under
a
sentence
for
some
prior
offense
which
is
not
revealed
in
the
record.
on
june
25th,
1958,
he
was
brought
before
the
circuit
court
for
the
city
of
richmond
along
with
an
unknown
number
of
other
defendants.
at
that
time,
and
on
that
date,
the
commonwealth's
attorney
filed
an
information
against
the
petitioner
under
the
recidivist
statute.
that
information
alleged
that
the
petitioner
had
been
three
times
convicted
and
sentenced
to
confinement
under
the
laws
of
virginia
and
it
averted
that
certified
copies
of
those
three
previous
convictions
were
being
shown
to
the
court.
the
convictions
were
not
enumerated
or
described
in
any
way
in
this
information.
at
that
point,
the
petitioner
requested
that
the
court
provide
him
with
the
assistance
of
counsel,
but
the
court
denied
that
request
and
proceeded
to
sentence
the
petitioner
along
with
the
other
defendants
to
10
years
in
the
penitentiary.
this
is
a
sentence
that
the
petitioner
is
now
serving
and
it
is
the
sentence
which
he
attacks
in
this
proceeding.
he
averts
in
his
habeas
corpus
petition
that
the
court
there
was
without
authority
and
jurisdiction
to
sentence
him
without
the
assistance
of
counsel
and
hence
he
is
now
being
held
illegally
by
the
respondent.
the
judge
in
the
law
and
equity
court
dismissed
his
petition,
as
i
stated,
without
calling
for
response
and
without
any
hearing.
he
delivered
an
opinion,
accompanying
a
dismissal,
in
which
he
held
that
under
the
law
of
virginia
there
was
no
right
to
court-appointed
counsel
at
a
recidivist
trial
and
he
further
expressly
held
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
there
was
no
right
to
court-appointed
counsel
at
this
type
of
proceeding,
citing
this
court's
decision
in
gryger
against
burke
and
chandler
against
fretag.
following
that
dismissal
of
his
petition,
the
petitioner
took
appropriate
and
reasonable
steps
to
appeal
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
in
his
petition
for
writ
of
error,
he
expressly
set
out
several
times
that
he
was
invoking
a
right
to
counsel
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
he
cited,
he
discussed
relevant
decisions
of
this
court.
on
the
basis
of
that
petition,
within
the
record
from
the
law
and
equity
court,
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
denied
the
writ
of
error
and
entered
an
order,
affirming
the
judgment
below
on
the
ground
that
it
was
plainly
right.
this
court
then
granted
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
appointed
counsel
to
represent
the
petitioner.
we
thus
have
here
before
us
a
final
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
virginia
in
a
proceeding
in
which
the
federal
constitutional
right
to
counsel
was
claimed
in
this
decision
of
the
state
court
as
necessarily
decided
that
claim
against
the
petitioner.
hence,
it
seems
clear
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
the
virginia
judgment.
now,
petitioner
here
is
contending
that
the
failure
of
the
circuit
court
of
richmond
to
provide
him
with
counsel
at
his
recidivist
trial
denied
--
violating
both
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
shall
leave
the
equal
protection
argument
to
the
brief
and
focus
here
on
due
process
problem.
under
the
due
process
clause,
there
are
two
grounds,
two
propositions
on
which
this
case
could
be
decided
for
petitioner,
indeed
should
be
decided
on
one
of
the
other
grounds.
first
is
that
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
particularly
the
nature
of
the
recidivist
trial
itself
show
that
the
absence
of
counsel
deprived
the
petitioner
of
a
fundamental
right
of
a
fair
hearing.
second
proposition,
a
bit
broader,
is
that
the
assistance
of
counsel
is
necessary
to
a
fair
hearing
whenever
a
state
moves
against
a
person
to
put
him
into
penitentiary
for
substantial
number
of
years
of
life.
now,
turning
to
the
circumstances
of
this
recidivist
trial
here
which
demonstrates
the
need
of
counsel,
the
first
point
i
would
make
is
that
the
cluster
of
questions
which
surround
the
prior
convictions
under
section
53-296,
asserts
that
no
layman
can
meet
them,
asserts
that
no
layman
could
even
appreciate
the
questions
existed.
now,
the
statute
itself
which
for
the
court's
convenience
is
in
the
petitioner's
brief
at
pages
2
and
3,
the
statute
itself
simply
says
that
the
prisoner
may
deny
the
existence
of
any
such
reference,
but
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
has
indicated
that
there
are
a
number
of
other
questions
that
may
be
raised
and
litigated
concerning
these
records.
so
it
might
be
pointed
out
here
that
even
if
the
petitioner,
a
layman
in
jail,
read
the
statute
carefully,
read
it
intelligently,
he
would
not
be
apprised
of
the
questions,
the
qualifications
thrown
around
the
use
of
certain
prior
records
which
have
been
put
there
as
a
matter
of
judicial
gloss.
now,
for
instance,
there
is
a
strong
indication
that
if
one
of
these
prior
convictions
are
still
pending
appeal
at
the
time
of
the
recidivist
trial,
the
defendant
can
object
to
its
use
on
the
theory
that
it's
not
conclusive.
moreover,
if
two
of
these
prior
convictions
occurred
at
the
same
term
of
court
or
on
the
same
day,
they
cannot
both
be
used.
this
is
not
altogether
clear,
but
there
is
a
strong
indication
it
so,
but
the
most
important
point
i
would
think
about
the
use
of
these
record
is
the
fact
that
they
are
open
to
collateral
attack.
it
seems
fair
to
say
that
any
ground
of
collateral
attack
on
these
convictions
can
be
raised
and
litigated
in
the
recidivist
trial
itself
whether
it
be
a
want
of
jurisdiction
in
the
convicting
court
or
whether
it'd
be
some
constitutional
defect.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
it's
by
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
in
their
opinions
by
way
of
holding
in
dictum,
i
would
say.
frequently,
this
has
come
up
by
way
of
suggestion
that
a
denial
of
counsel
in
one
of
the
underlying
convictions
were
voided
and
hence
remove
it
from
consideration
in
the
recidivist
trial,
but
it
seems
to
me
fair
to
say
that
any
federal
constitutional
defect
in
one
of
these
convictions
would
operate
to
void
it
and
to
remove
it
from
consideration.
for
this
case,
that
might
be
a
great
importance
because
if
one
of
the
three
underlying
convictions
in
this
case
was
successfully
attacked,
that
would
leave
only
two
convictions
which
would
mean
under
53-296
a
maximum
recidivist
sentence
would
be
five
years
whereas,
for
three
or
more
previous
convictions,
the
maximum
is
life
imprisonment.
the
petitioner
here
in
fact
received
10
years
so
it
would
be
possible
by
attacking
one
of
the
convictions
to
cut
his
sentence
in
half
in
this
case.
now,
last
term
in
reynolds
against
cochran,
the
court
here
pointed
to
this
feature
of
florida,
habitual
criminal
proceeding
as
one
aspect
of
it
which
demonstrated
the
need
for
counsel
and
showed
how
counsel
could
be
a
benefit
to
the
defendant.
now,
the
feature
of
this
virginia
proceeding,
which
above
all
else,
indicates
a
necessity
of
counsel,
is
the
sentencing
power
vested
here
in
the
trial
judge.
this
statute
gives
the
trial
judge
the
broadest
kind
of
granted
power.
there
is
no
minimum
and
no
maximum
prescribed,
that
is
the
maximum
is
life
imprisonment.
he
need
not
give
any
sentence
at
all,
as
i
read
the
statute.
that
is
open
for
his
decision
in
this
hearing.
there
is
no
time
limit
prescribed
on
how
far
back
he
can
go
in
using
old
convictions.
whether
the
conviction
happened
one
year
ago,
20
years
ago,
or
40
years
ago
is
immaterial
with
the
statute
to
the
power
of
the
trial
judge.
it's
also
immaterial
to
what
interval
went
by
between
these
convictions,
whether
they
were
a
year
or
two
apart
or
20
or
30
years
apart.
a
man
may
have
committed
an
offense
as
a
youth
in
decades
past,
he
commits
another
offense
this
--
the
power
of
the
trial
judge
comes
into
play.
it's
immaterial,
the
circumstances,
the
type
of
the
prior
offense
are
immaterial
under
the
statute.
the
only
qualification
is
that
it
carry
a
sentence
to
the
penitentiary.
whether
it
is
homicide
or
relatively
minor
lapse
is
immaterial
to
the
power
of
the
judge
here.
or
whether
it
would
be
a
crime
of
violence
or
not
is
of
no
consequence
to
the
power
of
the
judge.
in
short,
the
legislature
in
this
statute
has
given
the
trial
judge
a
blank
check
over
this
defendant
for
remainder
of
his
life,
assuming
three
valid
prior
sentences.
that
this
sweeping
power
vested
in
the
judge,
differentiates
this
proceeding
from
a
number
of
other
habitual
criminal
statutes,
particularly
the
west
virginia
statute
that's
just
been
discussed
here.
there
it
might
fair
to
be
said
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
proceeding
is
simply
to
identify
the
defendant
as
a
person
upon
whom
the
law
has
already
placed
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
here
the
law
itself
has
placed
no
sentence
on
the
defendant.
the
law
is
simply
saying
to
the
trial
judge,
bring
him
in
and
hold
the
hearing
and
you
decide
whether
any
sentence
at
all
is
necessary
and
if
so
how
much
up
to
life
imprisonment.
there
is
a
judicial
hearing
here
on
that
vital
question
and
here
is
where
i
would
contend
that
the
need
of
counsel
is
the
greatest
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
your
honor,
i
think
it
might
well
be.
all
i
can
say
here
is
that
as
a
matter
of
degree,
the
power
vested
in
this
trial
judge
is
so
much
greater.
for
one
thing
in
an
ordinary
criminal
prosecution,
the
judge
vested
with
the
discretionary
sentencing
power
will
have
presided
over
the
trial.
it's
tied
to
a
substantive
offense.
it
gives
him
some
context
in
which
to
impose
a
sentence.
some
frame
of
reference,
some
body
of
factual
information
about
the
defendant
and
about
what
he
did.
here,
the
man
is
brought
before
the
court
with
no
background
of
this
sort,
simply
records
of
three
prior
convictions.
now,
to
pursue
this
point
further
on
the
sentencing
power,
this
court
itself
has
recognized
in
cases
that
this
kind
of
decision,
the
matter
of
sentence,
where
a
sentence
is
not
fixed
by
law
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
kinds
of
questions
that
the
trial
judge
can
face
and
that's
particularly
so
in
this
type
of
case.
as
i
say,
this
is
not
tied
to
a
substantive
offense.
here,
the
judge's
problem
is
how
much
more
time
shall
we
put
this
man
in
the
penitentiary
over
and
above
all
the
time
he
will
have
served
for
each
one
of
his
offenses.
the
law
is
already
exact
with
this
penalty
for
each
offense.
now,
the
question
is,
shall
we
keep
him
there
over
and
above
that?
various
writers
in
courts
had
mentioned
that
the
judge
here
has
to
take
into
account
a
number
of
elements
such
as
protecting
society
against
these
habitual
offenders,
deterring
others
from
repeating
crime,
to
punish
him
further,
to
rehabilitate
him
if
he's
capable
of
being
rehabilitated.
all
these
package
of
intangible
factors
here,
the
judge
has
to
take
into
account.
now,
if
we're
going
to
have
any
kind
of
rational
decision
on
this
question.
a
decision
on
the
sentence
if
not
a
mere
whimsical
decision
by
the
trial
judge
it's
essential
that
he
have
before
him
a
body
of
facts,
facts
concerning
this
defendant,
his
record,
his
character,
his
personality,
the
totality
of
the
factual
data
surrounding
this
individual
defendant.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir,
there's
a
statute
providing
for
pre-sentence
report
in
felony
cases.
that's
one
of
the
questions
i
touched
on
in
the
brief.
it's
not
clear
to
me.
there's
no
virginia
decision
that
i've
found
which
says
this
is
available
in
a
recidivist
trial.
however,
it
appears
to
me
to
be
discretionary
with
the
trial
judge
so
that
he
could
call
on
a
probation
officer
to
make
a
pre-sentencing
report.
again,
one
of
our
points
is
that
without
a
lawyer,
the
defendant
is
not
apt
to
be
aware
of
this,
not
apt
to
call
it
to
the
trial
judge's
attention
so
that
the
trial
judge
could,
in
his
discretion,
call
for
this
pre-sentencing
report.
now,
it's
in
this
problem
of
developing
the
facts
relating
to
this
defendant
that
the
lawyer
services
are
so
necessary.
in
the
first
place,
by
hypothesis,
in
all
recidivist
trials
under
this
statute,
the
defendant
will
be
already
in
the
penitentiary,
locked
behind
walls
and
hence
disabled
from
getting
out,
investigating
his
case,
contacting
witnesses,
preparing
in
all
of
the
multitude
of
ways
in
which
a
case
is
prepared
on
facts.
he
cannot
do
it
himself
even
if
he
had
the
capabilities
and
the
know-how
because
he's
locked
up
and
he's
without
money.
so
the
lawyer
is
necessarily
in
that
regard,
but
more
than
that
the
lawyer
is
essential
because
this
is
the
kind
of
problem
here
that
even
a
prisoner
who
is
faced
some
prosecutions
in
the
past
will
not
be
familiar
with.
this
is
a
peculiar
proceeding.
a
prisoner
might
very
well
have
some
appreciation
of
how
to
meet
a
substantive
charge.
did
he
do
it
or
not
do
it,
was
he
there
or
not
there
and
all
of
the
various
kinds
of
issues
that
might
come
up
in
an
orthodox
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir,
i
find
none.
the
statute
itself
says
the
sentence
that
he
may
deem
proper.
i
find
that
to
be
no
standard
in
my
view
and
i
find
no
standard
even
in
the
legislative
history
as
it
is
or
in
the
decisions
of
the
courts
which
points
out
my
argument
that
the
judge
sits
there
with
his
enormous
power
over
the
man's
liberty
unfettered
by
any
standards,
not
hedged
in
by
any
limitations
imposed
either
by
statute
or
decision.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
mandatorily
life?
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
i
don't
have
the
exact
count
on
that.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
something
less
than
26.
it
would
purely
be
a
guess,
perhaps
it
does
have
more
but
it's
purely
a
guess.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
among
those
26
states
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
alright.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
the
sentence
--
the
florida
statute
which
was
before
the
court
last
term,
i
suppose
would
be
representative
of
that.
the
sentence
is
expressed
in
terms
frequently
of
the
amount
of
punishment
that
could
have
been
imposed
in
the
last
principal
offense.
sometimes
it
will
say
not
more
than
twice
the
maximum.
it
could
have
been
imposed
for
the
last
principal
substantive
offense.
there's
tremendous
variation
here
in
these
provisions.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir,
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
except
in
this
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
not
so
in
this
statute
mr.
justice.
in
the
virginia
statute,
the
moving
--
the
initial
moving
party
that
the
statute
contemplates
is
the
director
of
the
department
of
welfare
and
institutions.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir,
and
he
is
not
under
the
virginia
statute
given
discretion.
it
stated
that
he
shall
report.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
commonwealth's
attorney.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
let
me
add
one
more
comment
on
that
though.
this
differs
from
the
west
virginia
statute
in
this
regard.
under
the
virginia
statute,
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
these
cases
is
vested
in
one
court,
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond.
so
it's
not
at
the
discretion
of
prosecutors
all
over
the
state
to
bring
or
not
bring
the
recidivist
charge.
the
duty
is
placed
upon
the
director
of
the
department
of
welfare
when
a
prisoner
is
received
into
the
penitentiary,
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
this
one
court,
the
circuit
court
of
city
of
richmond.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
case
is
pending
now
setting
this
up
as
a
denial
of
equal
protection,
the
failure
to
invoke
the
statute
against
other
prisoners.
specifically
the
case
that's
pending
before
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
now
is
that
the
statute
is
not
brought
to
bear
against
prisoners
with
out
of
state
convictions.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
well,
that
wouldn't
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
that
wouldn't
bother
me
in
this
case
because
it's
left
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
i
don't
see
why
the
director
though
would
shy
away
from
invoking
it
in
this
case
in
this
--
under
this
statute
because
the
trial
judge
has
this
wide
choice
on
the
sentencing
question.
he's
not
compelled
to
give
life
or
nothing
as
in
west
virginia.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
well
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
which
is
the
exclusive
court
for
this,
my
impression
is
now
there
are
two
judges
that
handle
the
recidivist
cases,
maybe
mr.
hopkin.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
they
may
well
have
a
system
of
other
circuit
judges
serving.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
that's
according
to
the
statute,
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
he
sits
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond.
that's
the
only
court
that
has
jurisdiction
to
impose
a
recidivist
sentence.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
in
one
of
the
substantive
offenses.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
an
entirely
separate
independent
proceeding
from
any
other
criminal
proceeding
in
virginia.
that's
one
of
the
unique
features
of
our
case.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
my
only
information
on
that
is
outside
the
record
and
it's
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
i
do
have
a
report
for
the
year
in
which
our
man
here
was
sentenced
and
this
does
not
show
the
number
of
recidivists
actually
sentenced
under
the
recidivist
statute.
this
report
simply
shows
those
persons
received
in
the
penitentiary
who
were
subject
to
the
recidivist
statute
and
for
the
year
ending
june
30,
1958,
this
report
showed
a
total
of
417
who
had
prior
convictions.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
well,
the
statute
says
if
it
shall
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
director.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir,
the
statute
would
seem
to
lay
it
upon
him
to
report
then
to
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
and
then
the
information
is
filed.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
it
says
that
he
shall
report,
shall
give
the
information
thereof
without
delay
to
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
it
would
seem
to
me
that
he
has
number
of
other
duties,
yes
sir.
the
strange
thing
about
this
case,
i
might
just
comment
on
and
this
is
not
disclosed
by
the
statute
is
that
in
this
case,
the
information
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
was
filed
by
the
commonwealth's
attorney.
now,
the
statute
doesn't
mention
who
files
the
information
in
the
court.
it
says
the
director
gives
information
to
the
court
and
that
the
information
shall
be
filed
but
it
doesn't
say
who
files
it
so
as
a
matter
of
practice
inferring
from
what
is
true
in
this
case,
i
would
take
it
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
comes
in,
in
the
name
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
files
this
information
in
this
wholly
independent
criminal
proceeding.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
might
save
my
remaining
minute
or
two
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
might
take
the
questions
from
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
brennan
together
here,
to
answer
them
both,
we
are
here,
the
court
here
is
reviewing
the
judgment
of
course
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia,
a
judgment
which
has
affirmed
on
the
merits,
a
judgment
of
the
law
and
equity
court
of
richmond.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir,
i'm
citing
a
statute
first.
a
statute
of
virginia
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir,
in
the
record
at
page
29.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
the
court
states
that
the
record
had
been
materially
considered
and
inspected.
the
court
being
of
the
opinion
that
the
said
judgment
is
plainly
right
does
reject
the
petition,
the
effect
of
which
is
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
law
and
equity
court.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
the
judgment
of
the
court
was
a
judgment
of
dismissal
of
the
petition
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
--
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir,
i
won't
argue
that.
the
court
below
though
did
write
an
opinion.
now,
if
i
can
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
the
law
and
equity
court
wrote
it
in.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
the
law
and
equity
court
wrote
an
opinion
which
was
part
of
the
record
before
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir,
i
won't
contend
that.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
i
--
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
i'm
in
complete
agreement.
my
next
point
and
i
would
simply
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
correct.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir.
i
do
think
it's
open
to
this
court
though
to
look
and
to
see
if
there
is
any
state
ground,
tenable
state
ground
adequate
to
support
this
judgment
wholly
independent
of
the
federal
claim
and
i
would
say
there
is
none
and
i
would
say
the
respondent
here
is
resting
with
ghost
so
to
speak.
he
has
not
cited
a
single
decision,
a
single
rule
of
court,
a
single
statute
in
virginia
which
requires
an
explicit
allegation
of
indigency
in
a
habeas
corpus
petition.
and
against
that,
we
do
have
the
view
generally
taken
of
pleadings
by
the
virginia
court
that
we
take
us
through
not
only
to
the
facts
which
are
brought
in
the
petition
but
facts
which
may
be
fairly
inferred
from
those
avowed
and
i
would
say
indigency
is
one
of
them
in
this
case
and
this
court
itself
has
said
so
in
several
different
cases.
so
in
substance,
i
say,
you
search
the
record,
you
search
the
law
of
virginia,
we
find
no
state
ground
which
can
support
this
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
affirming
the
dismissal
of
the
petition.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
it
went
up
clearly
on
the
federal
question.
the
respondent
doesn't
deny
that.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
i
simply
say
there
isn't
one
there
when
we
look.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
i
would
assume
that
particularly
if
we
can't
find
such
a
state
ground
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
--
in
the
law
of
virginia.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
correct
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
