(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
justice

i
demand
you
setting
on
the
(inaudible)
justice

how
many
(inaudible)
mr.

how
many
cases
does
the

--
your
record,
(inaudible)
justice
felix

(inaudible)
with
that
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
does
that
mean
that
the
record
offers
(inaudible)
of
recidivist?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it's
--
if
this
information
come
to
your
knowledge
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it,
there
are
other
provisions
too,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
their
jurisdiction
exclusively
criminal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
so
because
the
judge
gave
a
reason
that
he
doesn't
have
to
give
(inaudible)
who
doesn't
give?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is,
as
i
understand
you,
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
you,
you
say
that
on
the
face
of
the
--
of
the
application,
in
the
face
of
this
writ,
he
showed
them
--
disqualified
from
getting
the
writ
that
he
asked
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
that
the
state
doesn't
have
to
reply
to
something
that
they
should
be
so
clear
that
he
doesn't
need
a
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
and
therefore
you
didn't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
as
simple
as
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
not
questioning
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
in
the
--
are
you
suggesting
that
this
case
turns
on
a
rule
or
law
of
local
practice
that
there
--
that
this
case
turns
on
the
state
ground
that
certain
requirements
are
made
by
virginia
for
pleading
or
particularity
of
pleading
in
this
kind
of
a
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
isn't
--
that
isn't
the
question.
if
suppose
your
supreme
court
had
spelled
out
as
you
just
have
done,
suppose
the
supreme
court
dealt
with
this
--
but
this
--
what
did
the
supreme
court
here
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
denied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
in
denying
it,
they
said,
â€œwe
think
the
allegations
are
inadequate
under
our
requirements.
"
that's
what
you
are
saying
they
impliedly
did.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
why
you
mix
it
up
as
to
what
the
requirement
on
the
federal
law
is
because
of
the
several
other
considerations
come
into
play.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
just
said
that,
this
doesn't
set
forth
then
we
have
to
decide
whether
the
procedural
ground
claimed
or
avowed
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
is
a
procedural
ground
that
the
state
may
take
or
is
an
evasion
of
--
of
a
federal
right.
that
would
be
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
suppose
he
had
alleged
it
and
from
that
--
go
from
there
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sufficient
grounds
under
the
due
process
clause
or
sufficient
grounds
under
the
requirement
of
virginia
procedure
(inaudible)
or
appellate
that
he
hasn't
made
out
of
that
more
is
required
as
the
matter
of
allegation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
required
under
what,
under
local
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
the
local
law
makes
the
requirement,
i
repeat,
suppose
they
spelled
it
out
then
we'd
be
confronted
with
the
question
whether
virginia
has
a
right
to
make
those
requirements
of
--
if
you
please,
these
stringent
allegation
as
its
mode
of
bringing
issues
before
a
court
which
is
a
very
different
question
from
the
question
that
mr.
meador
has
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
--
straighten
me
out.
i
seem
to
be
all
confused.
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
grounded
on
the
fact
that
at
the
time
an
enhanced
sentence
was
imposed,
it
was
imposed
on
the
conditions
that
deprived
him
of
a
claim,
constitutional
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
claim
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
there
is
no
doubt
as
i
understand
from
you
that
in
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
he
was
an
indigent
and
was
allowed
to
proceed
by
your
court
in
forma
pauperis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
you
say
is
that
the
constitutional
claim
has
no
basis
because
in
the
proceeding,
the
constitutional
invalidity
of
which
he
--
which
he
asserts
is
lacking
in
a
foundation
because
at
that
time,
no
showing
was
made,
no
showing
was
made
that
at
that
time,
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
have
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
ask
you
two
questions.
forgive
me.
what
are
we
reviewing
here?
are
we
reviewing
judge
young
or
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
i'd
like
to
ask
both
of
you
and
mr.
meador
when
he
gets
on
his
feet
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
we
reviewing
judge
young
or
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore
(voice
overlap)
therefore,
what
is
relevant
to
our
purpose
is
the
legal
significance
of
that
determination
and
not
what
judge
young
did.
we're
referring
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
alright,
of
course
(inaudible)
it
must
have
been
in
some
pleading
on
the
basis
of
which
some
judgment
was
entered,
loose
as
pleadings
are
these
days
and
generally
be
granted
as
they
seem
to
be
but
people
just
wanted
to
abstract
justice
but
that's
the
basis
of
this
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
we're
here.
this
case
was
brought
here
not
from
the
circuit
court
of
--
of
richmond,
it's
brought
here
from
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
maybe
it
was
brought
here
improperly.
i
don't
know.
i
haven't
thought
about
it.
but
if
we're
reviewing
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
then
what
we
are
reviewing
is
that
judgment
and
therefore
we
must
speculate,
and
if
that
judgment
can
rest
fairly,
not
speculatively,
but
fairly
on
the
state
ground
and
(inaudible)
though
the
supreme
court
had
written
in
the
state
ground.
the
other
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
before
you
sit
down,
you're
about
to
sit
down
and
you
haven't
said
a
thing,
at
least
nothing
that
i
have
heard
on
the
assumption
that
all
this
argument
thus
far
is
--
is
decided
against
you.
you
haven't
said
anything
on
the
merits
on
the
assumption
that
chewning
was
an
indigent
when
he
was
--
when
he
got
his
enhanced
sentence.
did
you
--
have
you
said
anything
on
that
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
you
mind
repeating?
let
me
ask
you
specifically,
assume
you're
wrong
on
this
indigence
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
should
the
case
--
are
you
then
in
effect
confessing
error
and
saying
there
should
be
a
reversal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
haven't
heard
any
argument
on
that
substantive
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
i've
been
deaf
while
you
were
talking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
you're
back
on
your
state
ground
namely
that
more
must
be
alleged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you're
back
unless
our
cases
say
that
a
mere
claim
of
indigency
under
these
circumstances
is
not
enough
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
united
states
constitutional
law
to
sustain
his
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
with
--
alright
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
document
that
last
statement
on
the
merits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
record
please.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
does
it?
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you,
but
does
the
supreme
court
--
did
the
supreme
court
in
virginia
say
in
terms
you're
affirming
judge
young
on
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
well
if
that
--
it's
done
that
then
that's
a
short
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
affirmed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
--
the
court
doesn't
affirm
an
opinion
when
it
affirmed
the
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
court
below,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
is
that
part
of
the
judgment
which
is
up
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
you
may
be
right
in
your
conclusion
but
--
but
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
a
game
or
this
isn't
any
tricky
stuff
that
i
am
suggesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
are
here
reviewing
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
want
to
know
what
that
judgment
was.
that
judgment
was
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
and
the
lower
court's
judgment
was
a
dismissal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
all
that's
here
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
judgment
dismissed
the
petition,
is
that
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
how
--
how
can
you
do
that
if
the
court
--
when
this
court
dismisses
something
and
doesn't
get
rid,
it
doesn't
conceal
its
reasons,
it
doesn't
deem
it's
fit
to
give
reasons,
that
isn't
concealing
and
so
you
of
course
say
what
you
said
that
this
court
must
see
if
there
is
a
state
ground
which
can
justify
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
weren't
playing
hocus-pocus.
they
made
known
something
so
clearly
that
they
don't
have
to
give
a
reason
which
is
why
we
don't
give
reasons
very
often.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
good
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
they
give
reasons
to
these
cases
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
find
it
then
there
isn't
any.
