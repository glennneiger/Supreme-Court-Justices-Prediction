mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
if
i
may
initially
attempt
to
answer
a
few
of
the
questions
which
were
propounded
to
professor
meador.
in
regard
to
the
pre-sentence
report,
there
is
no
pre-sentence
report
filed
in
these
cases.
i
have
never
known
and
i
don't
prosecute
to
understand
but
in
my
investigation,
i
have
never
known
that
any
pre-sentence
report
has
been
filed.
however,
there
is
before
the
court
at
the
time
each
man
is
brought
before
the
court,
his
folder,
his
folder
which
is
made
up
at
the
time
he
is
admitted
to
the
penitentiary
which
contains
all
of
his
pre-sentence
reports,
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
neurological,
psychological
tests
made
in
his
regard
and
this
matter
is
available
to
the
judge
of
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond.
in
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
are
two
judges
of
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
and
it
is
only
these
two
judges
that
sit.
i
have
not
known
since
i
have
been
in
the
attorney
general's
office
of
any
other
judges
sitting
in
this
court
on
habitual
offender
cases.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
an
unusual
court.
its
jurisdiction
is
limited
by
statute
to
specified
state
cases.
in
other
words,
you
can
only
sue
the
state
there.
and
they
have
the
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
something
like
that,
something
like
that.
i
will
try
to
first
briefly
discuss
the
motion
to
dismiss
which
we
have
filed
in
this
case.
we
feel
that
this
case
is
very
similar
to
the
newsom
case
which
was
before
this
court
earlier
this
year.
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
in
the
law
and
equity
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
does
not
allege,
it's
not
alleged
in
there
that
the
petitioner
was
indigent
at
the
time
he
was
tried
as
a
recidivist.
the
man
was
represented
by
court-appointed
counsel
at
the
time
of
his
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
law
and
equity
court.
the
petition
was
not
amended.
no
effort
was
made
to
amend
it.
moreover,
this
same
thought
would
be
applicable
with
regard
to
professor
meador's
argument
as
to
the
possible
invalidity
of
the
three
prior
convictions
which
form
a
basis
for
this
sentence
and
for
all
other
pertinent
matters
relative
to
the
statute.
he
was
represented
by
counsel
and
no
amendment
was
made.
he
does
not
allege
or
suggest
that
he
told
the
court
that
he
was
indigent
or
and
that
in
fact
he
was
indigent
at
the
time
he
was
tried
as
a
habitual
offender.
moreover
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
statute
in
virginia
in
regard
to
criminal
cases
which
is
now
19.1-241
on
which
the
petitioner
is
relying
herein
provides
that
in
every
criminal
case,
in
every
felony
case,
the
court
must
appoint
counsel
and
they
do
this
even
when
the
man
says
i
do
not
want
a
lawyer
and
then
once
we
try
them
and
convict
them
then
they
apply
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
i
might
add.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it
did
--
it
treated
the
case
as
an
indigent
case,
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
this
mr.
chief
justice,
sir,
is
that
we're
talking
about
indigency
at
two
different
periods,
there
are
two
different
periods.
he
is
indigent
now
or
at
least
he
alleges
that
he
is
indigent
and
the
pauperis
oath
attached
to
his
petition
verifies
this
together
with
the
statement
as
to
the
amount
of
funds
which
he
has
in
his
spending
account
in
the
penitentiary.
what
i
am
saying
sir
is
that
he
did
not
allege
or
suggest
at
the
time
he
was
tried
as
a
recidivist.
he
didn't
allege
in
his
petition
that
i
was
indigent
when
i
was
tried
as
a
recidivist.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
at
this
point
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir,
at
this
point.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i'm
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
don't
object
to
the
court
permitting
him
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
and
permitting
him
to
have
very
able
and
competent
court
appointed
counsel.
what
i
am
saying
sir
is
this
that
at
the
time
he
was
tried
as
a
recidivist,
we're
considering
that
now,
just
eliminate
everything
else
in
my
thoughts
where
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
below,
which
is
the
entire
basis
for
this
proceeding,
he
does
not
state
that
he
was
indigent
at
the
time
he
was
tried
as
a
recidivist.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
there
is
no
question
that
he
is
properly
everywhere
as
he
has
come
up
the
line
sir.
what
i
am
--
apparently,
i
am
not
making
myself
clear
obviously,
let
me
try
it
once
--
let
me
try
--
let
me
try
it
once
more
sir.
in
1958,
this
man
was
tried
as
a
recidivist
and
received
additional
time
in
the
state
penitentiary.
now,
in
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
he
says
that
i
ask
the
court
to
appoint
a
lawyer
for
me.
that's
all
he
says.
what
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
mr.
chief
justice
is
the
fact
that
he
did
not
state
in
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
in
1958
when
i
was
tried
as
a
recidivist,
i
told
the
court
that
i
was
a
pauper,
that
i
was
poor
and
didn't
have
any
money,
that
i
couldn't
afford
an
attorney
and
that
is
the
entire
basis
for
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
writ
of
certiorari
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
we
did
not
file
any
response
or
anything
in
regard
to
that.
no
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it
treated
him
as
an
indigent
at
the
time
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
law
and
equity
court.
this
is
a
collateral
attack
on
habeas
corpus
sir
of
the
conviction
in
1958
and
not
an
appeal
of
that
conviction.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
it's
a
collateral
attack
which
was
begun
in
the
law
and
equity
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
the
law
and
equity
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
the
procedure
followed
is
this
and
i
neglected
to
point
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
in
this
case?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
don't
know
how
exactly
he
was
tried
in
this
case
sir
because
the
record
does
not
reveal
it
other
than
the
court
orders
appending
--
the
information
and
the
court
order
appended
to
the
petition
for
writ
habeas
corpus
and
the
man's
statement
which
is
limited,
very
limited
to
the
fact
that
he
said
i
ask
for
counsel
and
no
counsel
was
appointed
for
me.
he
does
not
state
that
i
told
the
judge
that
i
didn't
--
couldn't
afford
counsel
and
i
was
indigent
and
that's
why
i
couldn't
employ
a
counsel,
he
gives
no
reason
for
that
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
in
other
words,
what
--
my
position
in
this
case
is
very
simple.
under
morris
versus
smith
which
is
the
latest
decision
in
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
and
penn
versus
smith,
it's
well
settled
that
well-pleaded
allegations
must
be
accepted
as
the
truth
and
in
penn
versus
smith
which
is
cited
in
page
12
of
our
brief,
we
pointed
out
that
it
is
necessary
any
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
allege
facts
and
we
are
contending
in
regard
to
our
motion
to
dismiss
that
the
petition
fails
to
allege
sufficient
facts
for
judge
young
who
was
judge
of
the
law
and
equity
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
act
on
it
because
judge
young
is
limited
in
his
jurisdiction.
he
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
petition.
he
has
no
jurisdiction
to
hold
a
hearing
in
this
case
because
under
the
applicable
provisions
of
law,
he
can
only
issue
the
writ
returnable
to
the
court
wherein
the
original
proceeding
took
place
because
the
man
has
alleged
certain
unrecorded
matters
of
fact.
now
our
position
is
that
the
man
failed
to
allege
sufficient
facts
to
justify
judge
young
in
issuing
the
writ
and
that
that
was
the
sole
question
which
was
before
our
court
of
appeals.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
fact
that
was
omitted
in
this
case
sir
was
the
identical
fact
which
was
omitted
in
the
newsom
case
except
at
a
different
point.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
fact
of
indigency.
in
other
words,
our
position
i
believe
is
quite
simple.
the
man
is
represented
by
counsel
at
the
time
of
his
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
appointed
by
the
court.
the
petition
was
not
amended
to
allege
that
at
the
time
i
was
tried
as
a
recidivist,
i
was
indigent.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
state
has
not
appeared
in
--
the
state
has
not
appeared
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
there
was
plenty
of
chance
to
amend
sir
but
the
state
was
never
called
upon
to
appear
in
the
proceeding.
this
is
the
same
judge
that's
cited
in
the
newsom
case.
the
same
judge,
the
same
thing
happened.
he
opined,
and
he
didn't
have
anything
to
opine
on
because
the
case
was
not
before
him.
he
had
nothing
that
he
could
do
except
issue
a
writ
returnable
to
another
court,
so
the
only
question
he
had
was
--
are
the
allegations
sufficient
to
justify
the
issuance
of
the
writ.
that's
the
only
question
he
had.
he
had
no
pure
question
of
law
and
so
he
couldn't
write
an
opinion
sir.
there
was
nothing
for
--
the
opinion
which
he
has
written
is
immaterial
and
irrelevant
and
is
not
pertinent
to
this
controversy.
now,
if
we
may
proceed
along
a
little
bit
in
connection
with
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
didn't
say
that
was
the
reason
he
dismissed
it
sir.
i
said
that
is
the
only
reason
that
he
could
have
had
sir
under
the
virginia
statute.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
would
have
to
answer
your
question
in
the
negative
sir
because
the
opinion
of
the
--
of
judge
young
never
states
that
the
man
is
indigent.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that's
right
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
and
that's
exactly
what
he
did
in
the
newsom
case
which
this
court
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
sir?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
would
you
mind
trying
that
question
once
more
sir
[attempt
to
laughter]?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
well
we
don't
have
any
right
to
come
(voice
overlap).
that's
right
sir.
we
were
not
called
upon
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that's
right,
very
simple.
now,
in
regard
(voice
overlap)
sir?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well
i
hope
i
am
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
to
conti
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
in
regard
--
to
continue
on,
in
regard
to
what
the
virginia
law
requires
in
connection
with
filing
a
petition
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus.
it
is
well
settled
that
it
is
necessary
to
plead
facts.
now,
the
--
our
authority
for
that
is
as
we
have
said
before
morris
versus
smith
and
the
penn
versus
smith
case.
now,
the
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
has
contended
that
in
virginia,
this
is
not
necessary
and
it
cited
several
cases
in
this
regard
and
it
has
compared
this
case
to
one
which
is
met
by
demurrer.
this
of
course
is
not
so
because
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
in
the
morris
case.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
of
adjournment
yesterday,
it
was
manifest
to
counsel
that
apparently
because
of
his
own
inaptness
or
perhaps
too
great
of
--
familiarity
with
the
problem
that
he
had
failed
to
state
to
the
court
in
a
clear
and
distinct
manner
his
position
in
this
case,
in
connection
with
his
motion
to
dismiss,
counsel
had
stated
that
he
thought
it
was
a
simple
question
perhaps
because
he
deals
with
it
quite
daily
and
day
in
and
day
out
and
quite
often
in
fact
twice
more
this
week,
so
with
the
court's
permission
in
a
few
minutes
remaining,
i'll
try
to
present
it,
perhaps,
i
hope
a
little
bit
more
clear
than
i
--
clearly
than
i
did
yesterday.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
then
i'll
refer
to
it
only
briefly.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
the
petitioner
in
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
failed
to
state
sufficient
factual
grounds
to
justify
the
law
and
equity
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
in
issuing
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
a
hearing
returnable
to
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
wherein
the
previous
judicial
proceeding
took
place
of
which
the
petitioner
complained.
this
is
because
the
petitioner
failed
to
state
in
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
when
he
requested
counsel
at
the
time
of
his
recidivist
proceedings
that
he
was
indigent
at
that
particular
point.
that
is
the
point
i
was
trying
very
desperately
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
to
make
on
yesterday.
now,
the
only
thing
which
is
before
this
court
for
its
consideration
is
this
record
which
contains
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
two
exhibits
appended
thereto.
that
is
the
only
thing
that
this
court
has
to
rule
upon.
an
examination
of
the
petition
reveals
that
there
is
a
bare
allegation
that
this
man
was
denied
counsel.
there
are
no
other
facts
alleged.
he
does
not
contend
he
was
indigent.
he
does
not
contend
that
he
was
denied
any
federal
constitutional
right.
he
does
not
contend
that
he
was
unfamiliar
with
court
proceedings.
he
does
not
suggest
anything
in
connection
with
the
proceeding
that
counsel
could
have
done
for
him.
he
does
not
allege
that
any
of
his
previous
convictions
were
unlawful
or
illegal
or
constitutionally
invalid.
indeed,
in
fact,
he'd
meant
before
this
--
been
through
this
proceeding
once
before
as
a
second
time
offender
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond.
now,
on
that
bare
allegation,
it
is
our
position
that
he
has
failed
to
state
a
case.
my
learned
friend,
professor
meador,
has
suggested
in
his
reply
brief
that
it
is
unnecessary
for
the
petitioner
to
avert
facts
in
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
this
is
contrary
to
virginia
law
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday
in
connection
with
morris
versus
smyth
which
is
found
on
pages
3
and
11
our
--
of
our
brief
and
penn
versus
smith
which
is
found
on
page
12
of
our
brief.
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
court
said
that
the
petitioner
must
state
facts
to
the
respond
--
the
petitioner
rather
in
this
court
has
suggested
that
under
tomkins
versus
missouri,
and
williams
versus
kaiser,
that
it
is
unnecessary
for
the
petitioner
to
state
that
he
was
indigent
at
the
time
he
requested
counsel.
an
examination
of
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
those
cases,
opinions
rather,
reveals
that
the
rule
in
missouri
is
and
it
has
been
so
stated
by
these
highest
court
in
the
state
of
missouri
that
if
a
man
alleges
that
he
was
tried
without
counsel
or
was
denied
counsel,
the
highest
court
in
that
state
has
held
that
it
will
assume,
that
it
will
assume
that
he
was
indigent
at
the
time
he
requested
counsel.
there
is
no
such
rule
in
virginia.
there
is
no
case
that
says
this
in
virginia.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
believe
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
you
have
stated
my
proposition
very
succinctly
sir.
that's
exactly
it.
it
not
only
turns
on
that
ground,
on
a
state
ground,
but
i
know
of
no
federal
case
and
there
may
be
many
that
i
have
not
found,
but
i
know
of
no
federal
case
that
says
that
you
can
come
in
and
say,
“now,
judge,
i
want
a
lawyer
appointed
for
me.”
i
know
of
none.
you've
got
to
state
that
you're
indigent
first.
now,
there
may
be
a
limited
number
of
situations
as
you
mr.
chief
justice
pointed
out
during
the
course
of
my
argument
in
newsom
case
where
a
man
has
plenty
of
money,
but
can't
get
a
lawyer
but
that
is
not
applicable
to
this
particular
situation.
we
are
suggesting
sir
that
the
petition
on
its
face
even
in
this
court
fails
to
allege
sufficient
grounds.
now,
as
the
cases
progress
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
denied
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
the
petition
for
writ
of
error.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
the
same
thing
they
did
in
the
newsom
case.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
true
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
i
would
say
this
to
the
court.
if
--
if
the
man
had
stated
he
was
indigent,
i
would
not
take
this
position
in
this
case.
i
would
--
i
would
admit
the
fact
that
he
was
indigent
because
he
would
have
alleged
it,
but
he
has
not
done
so
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
and
this
would
put
the
case
in
a
different
posture.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
alright
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
assume
that
he
has
alleged
that
he
was
indigent
and
was
denied
counsel,
that's
all.
on
those
bare
allegations,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
he
would
not
have
alleged
sufficient
grounds
even
then.
as
he
had
said,
“i
was
indigent,
i
am
ignorant
--”
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
think
that
more
than
the
bare
allegation
of
indigency
would
be
required.
he
would
have
only
had
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
local,
local.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
he
must
comply
with
section
14-180
of
the
code
of
virginia.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
sir?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
not
--
i
don't
know
whether
that's
printed
in
the
record
sir
or
not.
i
would
have
to
look
and
see
whether
or
not
he
put
in
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
that's
where
it
goes
to
the
supreme
court
by
notice
of
appeal
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it's
--
he
asked
leave
to
file
in
forma
pauperis.
now
the
entire
petition
is
not
printed
in
this
booklet
sir.
the
petition
is,
but
not
the
papers,
filed
therewith.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir
and
he's
been
allowed
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
he
alleged
he
was
indigent
and
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
the
record
was
designated
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case
sir.
i
filed
(inaudible)
designation.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
did
not
consider
it
quite
candidly
your
honor
as
particularly
pertinent
to
the
consideration
of
this
court
because
i
have
admitted
all
along
that
the
man
had
been
proceeding
in
forma
pauperis
in
his
habeas
corpus
proceeding
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
he
cannot
proceed
in
regard
to
alleging.
now,
let's
see
whether
i
can
differentiate
the
two
situations
sir.
my
position
is
that
he
has
failed
to
allege
in
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
at
the
time
he
was
tried
as
a
recidivist
under
the
habitual
criminal
statute
and
at
the
time
he
asked
for
counsel
in
connection
with
that
proceeding,
he
has
failed
to
allege
that
he
was
indigent
at
that
particular
point
or
that
he
told
the
judge
he
was
indigent.
we're
talking
about
two
entirely
different
proceedings
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
statement
is
not
contained
in
this
printed
record.
it's
in
the
file
sir.
when
he
filed
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
he
appended
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
i
would
assume
that
it
is
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that's
what
mr.
meador
is
claiming
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir
that
is
the
claim.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
judge
young
who
wrote
this
opinion
and
also
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
newsom
case
does
not
find
insofar
as
i
am
able
to
ascertain
as
a
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
indigent.
he
deals
with
cases
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well
that
--
i'm
afraid
i
must
answer
that
question
negative
sir
because
that
gets
back
to
judge
young's
authority
and
the
premises
which
is
limited,
very
limited
because
of
his
jurisdiction.
he
has
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
any
question
presented
to
him
except
a
pure
question
of
law
because
he
is
judge
in
the
law
and
equity
court
in
the
city
of
richmond.
in
this
particular
case,
this
man
is
confined
in
richmond.
judge
young
is
vested
with
the
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
petition.
the
only
jurisdiction
he
has
to
do
--
has
then
at
this
point,
he
can
do
two
things.
he
can
either
determine
that
the
allegations
are
sufficient
to
justify
the
issuance
of
a
writ
to
another
court
wherein
the
previous
judicial
proceeding
took
place.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct.
he
had
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
petition
presented
a
proper
showing
of
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
man
is
illegally
detained.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that's
what
he
concluded
and
that's
what
he
concluded
in
the
newsom
case
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
only
way
that
you
can
ascertain
that
fact
sir
is
by
reading
8
--
section
8-596,
8-598
of
the
code
of
virginia
and
the
cases
which
i
have
made
reference
to
in
my
brief
particularly
morris
versus
smyth
and
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well
i
believe
that
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
i
think
that's
what
the
reason
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
deny
the
writ
of
error,
so
that's
the
only
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
the
only
--
my
only
reason
for
making
that
statement
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
there's
a
great
deal
of
speculation
in
that
regard
sir
but
my
authority
for
that
proposition
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
i
don't
think
that
i
am
--
i
haven't
asked.
but,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
deal
with
this
subject
as
i
said
before,
ad
infinitum
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
court
determined
in
the
newsom
case
last
term
and
in
that
case,
the
same
situation
occurred,
it
was
the
same
identical
judge.
he
has
not
done
this
since
the
chewning
case,
because
the
chewning
case
came
after
the
newsom
case
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
the
same
situation.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
you're
reviewing
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
you're
reviewing
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
but
if
i
might
finish
that
sentence
i
started
sir,
you're
reviewing
as
i
understand
it,
the
decision
of
judge
--
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
in
connection
with
the
denial,
the
bare
denial
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
that's
what
you're
reviewing.
in
a
petition
form,
the
petition
itself
forms
a
basis
for
the
whole
proceeding.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
think
i've
got
two
sentences
in
today
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
assume
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir.
i
am
not.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
my
brief
is
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
my
brief
answer
if
i
may
make
it
to
that
question
sir
is
that
the
bare
--
assuming
that
he
was
denied
counsel,
assuming
he
was
indigent,
he
has
not
alleged
any
other
facts
which
would
indicate
that
he
was
denied
that
he's
rather
--
that
this
particular
proceeding,
under
the
recidivist
statute
which
is
not
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i'm
right
back
on
the
state
ground.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
thank
you
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
thank
you.
