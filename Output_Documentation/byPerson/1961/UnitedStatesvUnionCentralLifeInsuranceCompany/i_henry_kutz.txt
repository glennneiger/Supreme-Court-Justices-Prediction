mr.
i.
henry
kutz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
contest
between
a
mortgage
in
a
federal
tax
lien
for
priority.
under
statute,
under
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
i
hope
to
discuss
in
more
detail
later
on
my
argument,
a
federal
tax
lien
in
order
to
be
valid
as
against
the
mortgage
and
several
other
classifications
against
the
mortgagee
and
several
other
classifications
must
be
filed
in
either
one
of
two
ways.
in
a
state
office
where
--
which
has
been
established
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
state
or
authorized
by
the
laws
of
the
state
or
if
the
state
has
not
authorized
such
an
office
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
district
court,
the
issue
in
brief
here
is
whether
a
state
has
authorized
such
an
office
when
it
requires
that
the
notice
of
lien
describe
particular
parcels
of
real
property
in
order
that
it
may
accept
notice.
the
state
of
michigan
did
prescribe
under
its
law
that
any
notice
of
lien
filed
in
the
office
authorized
by
it
must
state
--
must
describe
the
real
property.
and
since
this
was
not
considered
as
permitting
a
notice
of
tax
lien
to
be
filed
in
the
form
and
with
the
efficacy
of
a
full
notice
of
tax
lien
that
was
filed
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
district
court.
the
facts
are
--
which
are
not
in
dispute
are
as
follows.
in
january
1954,
federal
income
taxes
were
assessed
against
robert
and
helen
peters
in
the
amount
of
some
$1300
and
notice
and
demand
for
payment
was
sent
to
them.
in
july
1954,
a
notice
of
tax
lien
was
filed
by
the
government
in
the
clerk's
office
of
the
united
states
district
court,
eastern
district
of
washington,
the
notice
did
not
contained
a
description
of
any
real
property
owned
by
the
tax
payers.
at
that
time,
the
statute
of
the
state
of
michigan,
statute
which
had
been
in
this
form
from
the
1920's
on
required
that
to
set
up
of
certain
offices
for
the
filing
of
federal
liens
but
required
that
the
property
be
described
before
the
--
in
such
a
notice.
in
5th
--
1953,
the
year
before
these
events
took
place,
the
attorney
general
of
michigan
had
ruled
that
the
registers
--
county
registers
in
michigan
could
not
accept
notices
of
tax
lien
unless
they
did
contained
such
a
description.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
county
register
would
not
accept
the
notice,
the
--
and
since
it
was
felt
that
this
was
an
unwarranted
condition
limiting
the
federal
tax
lien,
the
district
director
filed
a
notice
in
the
clerk
--
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
united
states
district
court.
subsequent
to
this
july
when
the
note
54
when
the
notice
was
filed,
the
insurance
company
respondent
here
gave
a
mortgage,
loan
money
and
gave
a
more
--
and
received
the
mortgage
from
the
peters
on
property
which
say
they
then
owned
in
oakland
county.
subsequently,
this
was
done
in
november
1954,
subsequently
the
peters
defaulted
on
the
payments
on
the
mortgage,
the
present
action,
the
action
before
the
court
here
which
was
one
of
foreclosure
the
mortgage
was
brought
in
the
michigan
state
court
and
the
united
states
was
joined
as
a
party
both
the
trial
court
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
held
that
the
government
had
not
filed
an
adequate
notice
because
it
had
been
filed
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
and
asserting
that
the
state
had
provided
an
office.
the
michigan
supreme
court
further
considered
two
decisions,
one,
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
youngblood
case
which
held
that
it
was
proper
for
michigan
to
require
that
the
real
property
be
described,
and
the
other
a
decision
of
the
ninth
--
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
rasmuson
case
which
held
to
the
contrary
supporting
on
the
government's
view
point.
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
noted
that
this
court
had
not
spoken
on
the
subject
and
decided
to
follow
the
youngblood
case.
the
nature
of
the
federal
tax
lien
is
that
it
attaches
upon
notice
and
demand
and
assessment
of
the
tax.
and
that,
it
applies
to
all
property
then
owned
by
a
tax
payer
or
after
acquired.
if
in
order
to
file
notices
of
tax
lien
in
the
state
or
any
other
office,
the
district
directors
would
have
to
describe
the
property
to
which
a
notice
attached,
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
some
officer
of
the
government
either
continuously
search
the
various
registers
offices
to
determine
whether
a
tax
payer
has
acquired
owned
property
at
the
time
the
notice
was
filed
and
in
particular
whether
he
acquired
property
later.
this
would
effect
we
believe,
very
seriously
the
efficacy
of
the
federal
tax
lien
as
created
by
congress.
we
think
this
is
an
unreasonable
and
improper
condition
to
the
designation
of
an
office
and
under
these
circumstances,
a
state
has
an
effect
not
designated
any
office
at
all
and
therefore
the
government
is
entitled
to
file
its
lien
in
the
office
of
the
united
states
district
court.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
the
federal
tax
lien,
we
believe
strongly
supports
this
argument
in
this
view
point.
the
federal
tax
lien
in
almost
its
present
form
was
first
established
in
around
1867,
but
at
that
time
there
was
no
provision
at
all
for
the
filing
of
notices
of
lien.
in
--
it
became
section
3186
of
the
revised
statutes
in
1875
and
then
1893,
a
case
came
to
this
court
construing
that
provision
of
the
revised
statute.
the
--
under
the
facts
of
that
case
which
is
united
states
against
snyder,
a
taxpayer
had
sold
real
property
to
a
bona
fide
purchaser
but
this
court
held
that
nevertheless,
the
purchaser
took
--
subject
to
the
tax
lien.
in
1913,
the
first
provision
for
notice
--
filing
of
notices
of
tax
lien
was
incorporated
into
the
statute.
that
provision
required
that
the
notice
be
filed
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
and
further
provided
that
if
a
state
authorized
a
place
in
a
county
for
the
filing
of
notices
of
tax
lien,
the
notice
should
also
be
filed
in
the
state
office.
in
1928,
the
revised
statute
section
was
further
amended
and
it
then
provided
that
the
notice
would
not
be
valid
as
against
the
mortgagee,
purchaser,
and
judgment
creditor
unless
a
notice
was
filed
in
one
of
two
places.
in
a
state
office,
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
state,
or
if
the
state
had
not
provided
such
an
office,
in
an
office
of
the
united
states
district
court,
while
that
statute
--
while
the
statute
in
that
form
was
in
effect,
namely,
when
the
words
were
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
a
state,
a
case
arose
in
the
sixth
circuit,
western
district
of
michigan
construing
the
very
statute
that
we
have
before
us
which
requires
that
the
notice
of
lien
include
a
description
of
the
real
property.
the
case
went
to
the
sixth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
against
the
government
on
--
for
the
reason
stated
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
that's
united
states
against
maniaci.
what
the
court
emphasized
was
that
the
statute
as
it
then
read
said
that
the
state
office
was
to
be
instituted
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
a
state
and
therefore
the
court
reasoned
that
since
the
state
might
by
law
make
certain
conditions.
within
a
few
year
--
two
years
after
the
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
of
the
maniaci
case,
congress
then
changed
the
law
--
amended
the
law
again
to
read
as
it
does
in
the
governing
provisions
here.
it
changed
the
language
from
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
state
to
and
--
ought
--
as
authorized
by
the
laws
of
the
state.
and
in
so
doing,
the
committee
reports
indicate
quite
clearly
that
it
was
the
purpose
to
obviate,
to
overrule
legislatively
that
station
of
the
sixth
circuit,
and
to
prevent
state
offices
from
doing
any
more
than
designate
state
--
the
states
from
doing
anymore
than
designating
offices
and
to
denying
to
states
the
rights
of
setting
any
conditions.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
not
by
name,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
read
what
the
committee
--
the
senate
committee
reports
said,
it's
on
page
16
of
our
brief,
that
treasury
department
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
section
3672
of
the
code,
that's
the
1939
code,
the
revised
statute
provision
have
been
renumbered
that
way,
and
the
corresponding
provisions
of
prior
law
authorized
the
state
or
territory
only
to
designate
the
local
office
for
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
lien.
this
section
of
the
bill
which
clarify
section
3672
(a)
as
amended
is
merely
declaratory
of
the
existing
procedure
and
in
accordance
with
the
long
continued
practice
of
the
treasury
department
which
has
been
questioned
in
the
courts.
and
i
think
in
the
--
if
i
may
add
that
mr.
justice
in
the
rasmuson
case,
the
eighth
circuit
construed
this
change
made
in
1942
to
be
intended
to
overrule
the
maniaci
case
and
i
think
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
i
don't
think
there
are
any
other
court
of
appeals
cases.
it
--
one
of
the
few
cases,
the
--
now,
after
--
after
the
amendment,
the
ninth
--
of
1942,
the
question
the
again
came
up
in
the
six
circuit
in
the
case
called
youngblood
against
united
states
which
is
one
of
the
cases
--
which
is
the
case
that
the
court
below
followed
here.
in
that
case,
the
united
states
attempted
to
mandamus
a
registrar
of
a
county
in
michigan
to
compel
him
to
accept
the
notice
of
lien
under
the
amended
1942
act
without
a
description
of
the
real
property.
and
the
government
prevailed
in
the
lower
court.
the
upper
court,
that
is
the
sixth
circuit
reversed,
and
its
holding,
we
believe,
was
principally
that
mandamus
were
of
a
state
ministerial
officer
who
was
merely
trying
to
carry
out
this
--
the
provision
to
the
statue
of
his
own
state
was
improper.
and
that's
all
as
we
think
the
case
actually
holds,
the
rest
is
dictum,
but
in
that
dictum
which
is
dictum
that
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
quoted
here,
the
sixth
circuit
stated
that
in
its
opinion
the
1942
amendment
did
not
change
the
situation
as
it
had
existed
before,
in
other
words
the
change
from
--
in
accordance
with
a
lot
--
in
office
establish
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
state
was,
in
its
view,
equivalent
to
statement
that
the
--
the
provision
in
1942
act
that
the
notices
must
be
filed
in
offices
authorized
by
the
laws
of
the
state.
subsequently,
in
the
eighth
circuit
in
united
states
against
rasmuson,
the
question
arose
under
minnesota
law,
and
there,
it
arose
in
connection
with
property
which
had
been
registered
under
the
torrens
system,
which
is
optional
in
that's
state
and
which
also
exists
in
about
a
dozen
states.
the
--
it
was
claimed
that
the
filing
by
the
government
was
ineffectual
because
it
wasn't
filed
as
against
the
very
property
that
was
registered
under
the
torrens
act.
in
other
words,
it
had
to
file
as
against
this
particular
parcel
which
is
substantially
the
same
as
requiring
a
description
in
a
notice
of
lien.
the
lower
court
ruled
against
the
government,
but
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
there
was
a
change
in
the
meaning
of
the
law
by
the
1942
act,
that
these
states
offices
are
authorized
by
congress
which
it
--
for
the
convenience
of
citizens
of
the
state,
the
state
may
take
advantage
to
them
as
it
wishes.
but
it
cannot
require
any
conditions
to
be
put
upon
the
lien
which
are
not
inherit
to
the
lien,
that
in
effect
all
that
it
can
do
is
designate
the
office
in
which
the
notice
of
lien
shall
be
filed.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
well,
i
think
it
requires
the
name
of
the
lienor
and
this
is
the
form
that
has
been
used
for
many
years.
the
name
of
the
lienor,
his
address,
business
or
residence,
the
taxes
--
the
statement
of
the
taxes
which
are
assessed
to
him
against
him,
and
the
statement
--
the
notice
of
lien
as
claimed.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
real
property.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
real
property.
if
i
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
in
fact,
our
argument
goes
a
little
further
if
your
honor
pleases,
we
say
that
to
insist
as
a
condition
that
real
property
be
described
would
impair
the
efficacy
of
the
lien
as
created
by
congress,
because
it
would
require
--
the
effect
would
be
that
the
lien
would
not
apply
on
after
acquired
property
of
the
tax
payer.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
well,
the
congress
just
says
the
notice
of
lien,
but
the
form
of
the
lien
as
it
has
been
filed
for
many
years
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
on
all
--
yes?
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
if
your
honor
pleases,
it's
on
page
22
of
our
brief
in
appendix
a.
if
any
person
liable
to
pay
any
tax
neglects
or
refuses
to
pay
the
same
after
demand,
the
amount,
including
interest
etcetera,
shall
be
a
lien
in
favor
of
the
united
states
upon
all
property
and
rights
to
property
whether
real
or
personal,
belonging
to
such
person.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
that
is
3672
(a)
on
the
same
page.
such
lien
shall
not
be
valid
as
against
any
mortgage,
pledgee,
purchaser,
or
judgment
creditor
until
notice
thereof
has
been
filed
by
the
collector,
one,
under
state
or
territorial
laws
in
the
office
in
which
the
filing
of
such
notices
authorized
by
the
laws
of
the
state
or
territory
in
which
the
property
subject
to
the
lien
is
situated,
whenever
the
state
or
territory
has
by
law
authorized
the
filing
of
such
notice
in
an
office
within
the
state
of
territory
or
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
i
think
that's
correct.
that
is
the
issue.
this
court
--
i
should
say
further
that
this
court
has
held
in
the
glass
city
bank
case
that
the
lien
applies
to
after
acquired
property.
i
mean
that
is
clearly
the
law
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
no,
but
we
couldn't
file
any
notice,
we
didn't
know
whether
they
were
going
to
acquire
property
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
our
brief
also
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
--
point
--
points
out
that
in
the
1954
code,
which
did
not
apply
here,
though
the
michigan
court
cited
it
and
quoted
it,
even
more
clearly
in
its
legislative
history,
shows
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
merely
that
states
might
designate
offices
not
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
no,
that's
--
that
was
under
the
1942
act.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
well,
i
think
the
statute
says
it
in
the
glass
city
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
no,
i
think
it
maybe
construed
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
--
on
glass
city.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
they
won't
accept
it.
there's
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
which
we
quote
in
appendix
c
of
our
brief.
they
just
--
they
said
it
isn't
proper
lien
under
our
law.

mr.

it

been,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
file
these
liens
claiming
the
completely
and
contrary
to
the
michigan
practice
which
was
exceptional.
michigan
was
not
the
usual
situation.
you
have
michigan
and
you
have
these
torrens
states,
but
in
most
of
the
states
there
was
no
such
provision
made.
and
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
send
to
the
court
a
letter
in
which
i
referred
it
to
articles
in
the
michigan
law
review
which
had
not
come
to
my
attention
until
i
was
preparing
this,
describing
the
situation
generally.
mr.

henry
kutz
now,
under
the
1954
code
that
is
the
law
is
in
effect
in
1955
while
as
we
argue
in
our
brief,
we
think
a
fortiori,
this
--
the
government's
position
is
correct,
and
congress
clearly
intended
that
to
be
so.
it
also
showed
that
it
was
just
clarifying
the
preceding
practice.
furthermore,
the
michigan
authorities
would
not
accept
these
liens
up
until
the
chance
--
that
1956
when
they
adopted
the
uniform
law,
that
is
stipulated
on

in
page
10
of
the
transcript
record.
the
uniform
law
has
been
adopted
in
about
25
states
and
the
problem
comes
up,
i
might
say
in
another
situation,
i
hope
in
connection
with
automobiles
which
are

certificates
are
given
by

of
title
by
the
register
of

and
in

states,

tried
to
insist
that
the
government
file

against
these
certificates,

of
