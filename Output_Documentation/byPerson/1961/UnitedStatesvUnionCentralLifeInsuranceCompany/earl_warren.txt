mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler,
when
you
amended
your
law
in
michigan,
you
adopted
a
uniform
law,
didn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
many
states
--
do
you
happen
to
know
have
the
uniform
law
at
the
time
of
this
tax
lien?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
not
required
--
that
does
not
require
a
description
of
the
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
uniform
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
--
i
suppose
that
was
in
existence
before
congress
changed
its
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
that
isn't
what
--
that
isn't
what
i
mean.
these
uniform
laws
are
presented
to
all
of
the
states
of
the
union
and
they
adopt
them,
some
adopt
them,
a
great
many
of
them,
some
don't.
but
here,
i
suppose
the
uniform
law
was
in
existence
in
some
states
before
michigan
adopted
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
if
you
know
is,
how
many
states
had
this
uniform
law
at
the
time
of
these
particular
liens
that
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
know
whether
there
was
a
great
number
or
very
few?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
--
the
reason
i
asked
you
that
is
because
of
what
counsel
read
from
the
reports
of
the
committee
in
which
congress
--
in
which
the
committee
of
congress
said
that
that
this
had
been
the
longstanding
practice
of
the
treasury
and
they
were
merely
righting
it
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler,
may
i
trouble
you
just
once
--
once
more,
you've
taken
care
of
the
jay
smiths
in
the
community.
now,
how
about
the
government
where
the
property
--
whether
the
property
is
--
the
ownership
of
the
property
is
undisclosed
in
the
community,
there
must
be
a
lot
of
real
property
even
if
the
ownership
for
which
is
undisclosed
or
would
be
undisclosed
if
liens
became
ineffective
unless
the
description
of
the
property
was
recorded.
now,
how
--
if
a
man
was
the
undisclosed
owner
of
certain
real
state,
and
the
government
didn't
file
a
description,
how
would
the
tax
policies
of
the
united
states
be
carried
into
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
mr.
butler,
you
had
that
law
since
1923,
have
you
enforced
it
regularly
in
--
against
the
government
since
1923?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kutz,
can
you
tell
me
what
the
factors
has
been
in
the
treasury
department
throughout
the
country
in
the
light
of
what
you
read
from
the
report
of
the
committee,
the
house
committee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
house
committee
rather?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
do
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
