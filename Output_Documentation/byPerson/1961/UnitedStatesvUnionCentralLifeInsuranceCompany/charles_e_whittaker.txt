whittaker
on
that
story,
i
understand
your
statute
to
permit
acceptance
of
the
lien
so
far
as
personal
property
is
concerned
without
any
description.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
this
section
7.751
shown
at
appendix
a,
page
23
of
your
brief
which
seems
to
require
a
description
only
of
default
land,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
and
--
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon,
to
the
government's
brief,
appendix
of
the
government's
brief.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
appendix
a,
section
7.751.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
might
be
good
as
between
the
parties,
but
not
as
against
creditors,
mortgagees,
and
the
like.
