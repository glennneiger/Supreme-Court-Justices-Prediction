mr.
h.
william
butler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
important
thing
that
we
should
keep
in
mind
in
considering
this
case
is,
first
of
all,
that
we
undoubtedly
must
recognize
that
we're
living
in
a
commercial
society
within
this
country.
and
this
court
has
also
recognized
that
the
plenary
powers
of
congress
particularly
in
the
taxing
field
must
sometimes
give
way
so
as
to
maintain
that
fluidity
of
commerce.
for
example
if
you
want
to
take
the
history
of
this
particular
situation
prior
to
the
1913
amendment
congress
had
said
apparently
that
these
liens
could
be
filed
without
reference
to
any
kind
of
notice
and
many
persons
suffered
as
a
result
of
it.
congress
recognized
in
this
problem
in
1913
amended
the
statute
to
provide
for
notice
so
as
to
provide
some
protection
to
commerce
and
to
people
that
they
--
so
that
they
could
deal
freely
with
property.
now,
that's
an
overlying
principle
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
very
wisely
recognized
that
where
you're
going
to
impinge
upon
the
fluidity
of
this
commerce,
there
must
be
good
and
compelling
reasons
to
do
so.
and
if
we
apply
those
principles
to
this
case,
and
if
we
also
recognize
that
this
plenary
power
to
interfere
with
the
fluidity
of
commerce
through
these
ill-noticed
liens
should
be
curtailed
or
at
lease
should
only
be
allowed
to
the
extent
congress
grants
it.
but
i
think
you'll
agree
with
us
that
this
case
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court.
i'd
like
to
address
my
argument
to
that
phase
--
mr.
h.
william
butler
no
sir,
not
at
all.
i
want
to
make
that
expressed
from
the
beginning
that
we
do
not
question
congress'
power
and
we
do
not
question
the
fact
that
had
congress
seen
the
fit
to
do
so,
it
could
go
right
back
to
the
situation
prior
to
snyder.
we
are
concerned
here,
mr.
justice
harlan,
only
with
interpretation
of
these
congressional
enactments,
two,
a
number
that
we
accept
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
three,
a
number
if
we
accept
ours.
now,
let's
just
view
the
situation
first
of
all
from
the
actual,
realistic
matters
that
stands
now.
all
this
argument
about
hardship,
all
this
argument
about
the
problems
of
the
district
collector,
the
taxing
authorities
are
now
for
naught.
in
1955,
this
statute
was
amended.
so,
there
is
no
longer
any
question
about
it.
the
district
collector
is
no
longer
confronted
with
any
problems
such
as
--
were
set
forth
here
and
since
1955,
there's
been
no
requirement,
there's
been
no
requirement
that
the
description
be
put
on
because
congress
in
1955
unequivocally
and
clearly
declared
what
its
intention
was.
mr.
h.
william
butler
that
statute
is
the
present
statute
sir
and
it's
found
in
the
appendixes,
i
believe
of
the
brief
of
the
united
states,
in
their
appendixes,
yes,
at
appendix
b
on
page
25.
that
is
present
statute
and
has
been
in
effect
since
january
1st
of
1955.
mr.
h.
william
butler
not
(inaudible)
--
well,
sir,
i
think
it
bears
on
the
fluidity
of
the
argument
to
this
extent,
that
the
american
bar
association
and
others
are
recognizing
the
problem.
this
is
created
by
what
congress
has
done
now
and
even
now
our
talking
sir
in
terms
of
seeking
some
sort
of
amendment.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
for
example,
we
have
a
kind
of
saying
in
michigan,
“heaven
helped
the
property
owner
named
jay
smith,”
because
if
there
is
one
jay
smith
who
has
been
a
little
bit
derelict
in
paying
his
taxes,
every
jay
smith
owning
property
now
may
come
under
question.
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
believe
that
you
could
say
very
well
say
that
although
i
do
think
that
the
1955
amendment
supports
exactly
what
we're
arguing
with
reference
or
prior
to
it.
and
i
would
also
point
out
sir,
that
this
court,
i
believe
in
a
very
enlightened
opinion
in
brosnan
has
recognized
that
unless
there
is
a
clear
intent
would
appear
with
the
fluidity
of
commerce
it
should
not
be
so
extended
and
construed.
now,
--
mr.
h.
william
butler
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
william
butler
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i
do
not
know
exactly
how
many
states
have
the
uniform
law
at
the
time
of
this
tax
lien,
i
can
answer
your
question
possibly
and
directly
by
saying
that
in
1923,
michigan
adopted
the
statute
which
i
believe
was
uniform
at
that
time
and
required
in
most
states
did
that
the
lien
contained
a
description.
after
the
amendment
in
1955
which
obviated
this
problem
completely,
michigan
thereafter,
i
believe
in
1956,
adopted
its
present
act
which
i
believe
to
be
the
uniform
recording
statute
now.
mr.
h.
william
butler
after
congress
expressly
declared
itself,
michigan
went
along
--
mr.
h.
william
butler
that's
right.
mr.
h.
william
butler
no.
michigan
until
congress
changed
its
act
in
1955
had
an
act
on
its
books
requiring
that
the
lien
contained
a
legal
description.
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
believe
so
sir.
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
do
not
know.
i
cannot
answer
that.
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
believe,
if
you
read
maniaci
and
if
you
read
youngblood
and
--
as
i
hope
to
develop
further,
the
government
was
confronted
with
this
problem
in
many
states.
in
fact,
until
rasmuson
was
decided
sometime
in
1958,
which
was
after
the
amendment
doing
away
with
the
requirement
of
any
notice
by
congress,
until
that
time
that
--
i
believe
your
honor
was
the
first
decision
on
any
of
the
books
stating
that
there
had
to
be
a
description.
and
i
believe
that
it's
a
fair
inference
from
the
record
that
most
states
require
that
there'd
be
some
legal
description
in
the
lien
prior
to
1955.
in
fact,
i
believe
i
do
not
want
to
state
it
as
axiomatic
that
the
michigan
act
of
1923
requiring
a
description
was
equivalent
to
a
uniform
act
if
not
the
uniform
act
which
all
states
had
prior
to
1955.
i
believe
that,
but
i
am
not
certain.
mr.
h.
william
butler
well,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i
cannot
state
expressly
but
it's
my
recollection
and
it's
my
belief
that
most
states
prior
to
1955
--
mr.
h.
william
butler
--
require
--
mr.
h.
william
butler
--
the
description.
mr.
h.
william
butler
and
that
this
was
the
frustrating
experience
for
the
treasury
department,
and
as
a
result,
congress
finally
clearly
expressed
itself
of
1955.
mr.
h.
william
butler
and
i
might
add
that
since
1955,
the
problem
does
not
exist.
so,
we're
now
concern
to
reach
back
six
years
in
time
to
decide
what
we
should
do.
and
i
believe
that
based
upon
the
concepts
promulgated
by
this
court
in
brosnan
and
other
decisions
that
a
recognition,
the
commercial
fluidity
sometime
is
equally
important
with
the
plenary
power
of
the
government
that
we
should
observe
the
policy
certainly
of
michigan.
now,
michigan
since
1923
has
required
that
any
lien
contained
a
legal
description
to
be
effective,
we
have
not
confined
ourselves
to
government
tax
liens
but
it's
also
the
policy
of
michigan
that
any
sort
of
a
levy,
any
sort
of
a
lien
against
the
real
property
to
be
valid
must
contain
a
legal
description.
we're
going
to
protect
the
999
other
jay
smiths
who
may
not
have
been
the
person
involved.
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
cannot
answer
that
question
directly
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
believe
that
the
michigan
policy
as
declared
certainly
has
been
to
require
some
description
as
clear
as
possible
of
the
real
--
of
the
even
personal
property.
for
example,
our
recording
laws
with
reference
to
channels
require
a
clear
description
of
the
channel.
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
believe
that
that
is
the
section
which
--
are
you
referring
to
page
23
of
our
brief,
mr.
--
mr.
h.
william
butler
page
23.
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
believe
that
this,
sir,
quotes
only
that
portion
of
the
statute
mr.
justice
whittaker,
which
relates
to
land.
my
recollection
is
that
there
are
other
provisions
which
have
to
do
with
chattels.
i
do
not
otherwise
know,
i
cannot
state
that,
and
i
cannot
answer
that
clearly.
mr.
h.
william
butler
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i
believe
the
--
i
don't
want
to
avoid
your
question
but
i
believe
the
answer
is
best
made
indirectly
by
saying
that
if
the
ownership
is
undisclosed,
the
government's
lien
is
going
to
be
much
used
to
it
at
any
event
because
it
doesn't
even
know
the
ownership
of
the
property,
they'd
have
to
bring
tracing
processes
at
which
time
they
would
have
disclosure,
but
i
believe
more
important,
the
answer
to
this
whole
situation
where
the
government
seeks
to
build
this
up
as
enormous
problem
prior
to
1955
has
been
answered
in
our
brief
where
we
point
out
that
the
only
time
the
government
is
going
to
have
this
problem
is
where
these
persons
against
whom
the
lien
has
been
filed,
either
subsequently
convey
or
subsequently
mortgage,
and
many
people
against
whom
liens
have
been
filed
do
neither.
and
then
it's
only
going
to
arise
where
a
bona
fide
purchaser
per
value
comes
into
the
picture,
and
many
of
these
people
don't
make
transfers
of
value.
they
may
make
these
secret
transfers.
mr.
h.
william
butler
but
the
statistics
of
it,
we
do
not
agree
with
it.
even
if
it
were
so,
if
we
go
back
these
six
years,
we
don't
have
the
problem
now.
but
even
so,
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
will
became
too
much
of
a
problem.
mr.
h.
william
butler
yes,
it
does
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
do
not
believe
so,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
do
not
believe
it
does.
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
will
endeavor
to
do
so
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
h.
william
butler
we
have
a
law
which
re
--
no,
the
judgment
in
michigan
your
honor
does
not
become
a
lien
automatically
but
--
mr.
h.
william
butler
no.
after
notice
was
given,
there
was
a
requirement
that
it
be
reduced
by
a
process
of
the
court,
that
would
be
reduced
to
one
attachment
and
that
then
the
attachment
be
recorded
with
the
legal
description
of
the
property.
with
reference
to
real
property,
michigan
has
deviated
in
very
few
respects
from
a
requirement
that
the
real
property
be
completely
identified.
mr.
h.
william
butler
that
would
be
an
invalid
mortgage
in
michigan.
mr.
h.
william
butler
it
has
to
be
precise
and
certain
to
encumber
the
land,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
h.
william
butler
that
is
correct
mr.
whittaker
--
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
h.
william
butler
it
would
properly
good
as
between
the
parties
if
there
were
no
intervening
rights
of
bona
fide
purchases
or
others.
now,
i
don't
want
to
burden
the
court
too
much
with
the
fact
because
i
don't
believe
it's
contradicted,
that
michigan
has
clearly
intended
from
1923
on
that
any
sort
of
a
lien
or
encumbrance
against
property
contained
a
proper
description.
mr.
h.
william
butler
yes,
it
would,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
would
require
a
complete
metes
and
bounds
description.
mr.
h.
william
butler
that's
right,
we
require
that
there
be
a
legal
description
with
reference
to
the
range,
the
county,
and
the
--
there's
a
recorded
plat,
if
the
course
is
adequate
and
preferences
made
to
the
plat
of
the
michigan
plat
act,
but
it
has
to
be
a
complete
and
clear
description.
mr.
h.
william
butler
correct
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
william
butler
yes,
we
have
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
we
have
the
opinions
of
this
court
going
back
of
our
courts
and
of
the
sixth
circuit.
going
back,
quite
along,
and
if
you
read
the
maniaci
case,
it
is
quite
apparent
from
a
reading
of
that
since
1928.
the
--
that
construction
have
been
put
upon
it.
we
have
many
cases,
we
have
cases
of
our
circuit
court
one
or
two
of
those,
hicks
versus
carpenter
which
is
unrecorded
case.
we
have
the
united
states
versus
maniaci,
our
attorney
general
made
a
declaration
of
it.
as
mr.
justice
black
points
out,
our
lien,
our
judgments
could
not
become
a
lien
but
it's
required
that
they
could
reduce
to
a
description
and
this
has
been
the
declared
policy
of
michigan.
mr.
h.
william
butler
we
have
not
cited
that
in
the
appendix.
there
are
statutes
on
the
book,
the
exact
scope
of
those,
i
do
not
know,
but
we
have
not
cited
those
neither
of
our
--
in
any
of
the
briefs.
mr.
h.
william
butler
i'm
afraid
i'll
have
to
ask
the
court's
deference
and
that's
to
allow
me
to
communicate
with
the
court
the
next
two
days
giving
those
--
mr.
h.
william
butler
--
citations
and
findings.
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
do
not
know
they
all
have.
mr.
h.
william
butler
yes,
it
does
--
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
will
--
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
will
endeavor
to
communicate
that
to
the
court
upon
my
return
to
detroit
if
i
may.
mr.
h.
william
butler
conceivable,
it's
conceivable
your
honor.
now,
that
being
a
declared
policy
why
should
it
be
disturbed,
particularly
by
what
must
be
regarded
at
best
as
rather
ambiguous
declarations
of
congress?
now,
the
youngblood
case
was
a
clear
declaration
that
under
the
very
law
involved
in
this
particular
case
and
youngblood
became
the
law,
i
believe
not
only
the
circuit,
but
the
law
of
most
circuits
at
that
time,
in
1944,
that
was
passed.
it
was
a
clear
declaration
to
the
effect
that
after
all
if
a
lien
was
to
be
asserted
against
real
property,
that
lien
should
be
recorded
as
the
statute
gave
the
right
with
the
register
of
deeds
of
the
county
where
the
land
was
situated.
youngblood
was
not
dictum.
three
quarters
of
that
decision
discussed
this
very
question.
i
think
it's
a
well-reasoned
opinion.
i'm
prejudiced
because
it
holds
with
me,
but
i
also
believe
that
it's
a
well-reasoned
opinion
and
properly
approaches
the
whole
problem.
youngblood
also
discussed
mandamus,
that
was
the
other
phase
of
it,
but
it
would
be
equally
appropriate
since
both
subject
were
discussed
to
say
that
the
mandamus
phase
of
it
was
dictum
and
that
the
discussion
about
the
relevancy
of
the
44
statute
was
germane
to
the
case.
i
won't
burden
the
court
with
a
host
of
citations
about
dictum,
they
were
not
raised
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states,
so
we
didn't
bother
to
answer
them,
although
in
the
brief
before
the
michigan
supreme
court
they
were
raised,
and
our
brief
in
reply
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
brief
contains
those
citations.
now,
in
the
few
moments
that
i
have
remaining,
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
to
the
court
the
reason
why
we
believe
that
youngblood
is
correct.
please,
may
the
court
bear
in
mind,
that
this
is
a
question
not
of
the
power
of
congress,
but
of
the
intent
of
congress.
we're
dealing
with
these
statutes
in
1942-1944
and
earlier,
did
congress
intend
that
the
state
could
protect
the
muniments
of
its
titles
by
requiring
that
the
collector,
like
everyone
else,
if
he
wants
to
file
a
lien,
should
do
so
by
properly
describing
the
property.
we
say
clear
it
was
intended
to
be
so.
now,
going
back,
the
united
states
first
brought
this
problem
up
in
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
maniaci
which
is
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
goes
back
to
about
1939.
and
i
had
the
interesting
experience
of
reading
that
case
again
this
morning
before
i
came
down
and
it
sounds
as
though
the
government,
the
same
learned
counsel,
the
government
was
arguing
in
maniaci
at
that
time,
because
in
36
f.supp.,
the
argument
of
the
government
was
set
forth
in
this
language.
the
government
urges
that
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
of
1928
was
solely
to
leave
to
the
states
the
power
to
designate
by
law
the
place
of
filing
of
notice
of
lien,
that
a
law
requiring
a
notice
to
set
forth
a
description
of
the
property
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
legislature
and
that
subject
provisions
neither
authorize
nor
approved
by
the
act
of
1928,
if
we
substitute
the
words
1942
for
1928,
we
virtually
epitomize
the
whole
position
of
the
government.
and
the
sixth
circuit
in
maniaci
struck
that
down
and
refused
to
by
--
abide
by
it
and
said
that
the
laws
of
michigan
very
properly
state
that
the
lien
must
contain
a
description.
and
then,
the
act
was
amended
in
1942
and
the
government
again
came
back
and
said
we're
confronted
with
these
hardships,
and
they
argued
in
youngblood,
there
should
be
no
requirement
that
the
lien
be
recorded
with
the
register
of
deeds.
and
the
sixth
circuit
again
in
youngblood
took
cognizant
of
all
of
these
arguments
and
again
said
unless
congress
clearly
states
what
it
intends
to
do,
we
must
rely
upon
the
statute
as
it
reads
and
that
statute
does
not
require
it.
now,
it's
interesting
to
note
these
gyrations
made
in
amending
the
statute.
from
1913
unto
1928,
which
became
the
1939
provision
of
the
code,
that
was
the
old
act,
the
law
stated
that
the
lien
would
be
valid,
it
must
be
valid
to
be
valid
--
it
must
be
filed
in
the
register
of
deeds
when
any
state
by
appropriate
legislation
authorizes
the
filing
of
such
notice
in
the
office
of
the
register
of
deeds.
that's
the
way
the
law
stood,
and
in
1928,
that
was
amended.
and
28
act
which
became
part
of
the
39
code,
struck
out
that
language
and
said
that
the
lien
to
be
valid
must
be
filed
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
state
or
territory
--
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
state
or
territory.
now,
solicitor
general
is
here
today
arguing,
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
state
or
territory
concededly
means
that
maniaci
was
probably
right
and
that
the
state
could
say
the
lien
must
have
a
description.
and
yet
before
maniaci,
this
opposite
position
was
taken
and
it
was
said
this
changed
the
law
and
that
it
was
no
longer
necessary
that
the
state
require
a
levy
--
the
levy
to
contain
a
description
because
the
1913
act
required
it,
and
now
it's
changed.
in
other
words,
the
government
since
1913
has
been
saying
congressional
changes
mean
just
exactly
that
we
no
longer
have
to
do
it.
but
the
most
significant
telling
part
of
this
whole
thing,
it
seems
to
me
is
this,
in
1944
before
youngblood,
the
government
again
came
in
and
said,
the
statute
has
been
amended
again
in
accordance
with
the
law
has
been
deleted
and
both
statute
now
reads
in
the
office
in
which
the
filing
of
such
notice
is
authorized.
therefore,
the
state
can
no
longer
set
forth
the
requirements
for
filing
that
only
is
given
a
place,
and
that's
the
argument,
and
they
say
youngblood
is
wrong
because
youngblood
didn't
go
along
with
this
on
that
and
recognizes
clear
declaration
of
congress
but
--
mr.
h.
william
butler
i
have
been
practicing
law
long
enough,
sir,
to
realize,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
it's
pretty
difficult
to
determine
what
congress
sometimes
intends
when
you
see
the
ultimate
product
that
congressional
action
come
up
and
become
a
part
of
the
statute
books.
i
don't
think
it
means
anymore
than
it
did
in
1913
when
they
changed
the
act
and
went
back
to
what
vir
--
and
passed
what
is
now
virtually
the
1944
act,
because
in
1913
the
statute
read,
authorized
the
filing
of
such
notice
and
the
office
of
the
registrar.
in
other
words,
the
state
statute
authorizes
the
filing,
they
talked
of
filing.
then
in
1928,
or
which
became
part
of
the
1939
code,
they
struck
that
and
they
said
in
accordance
with
the
law.
and
then
in
1944,
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
one
that
we're
confronted
with
now
which
changed
all
this,
they
go
right
back
and
virtually
reenact
the
1913
statute
which
says,
in
the
office
and
which
the
filing
of
such
notice
is
authorized
by
the
law.
so
we've
gone
through
almost
the
complete
cycle.
and
most
importantly,
i
would
adopt
in
a
sense
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
in
stating
congressional
direction
is
manifested
by
the
1955
act,
because
in
1955
when
congress
finally
want
to
make
it
clear,
it
had
no
trouble.
and
interestingly
enough,
mr.
justice
harlan,
when
it
didn't
make
the
amendment,
it
did
not
go
back
and
amend
section
6
--
3672
which
have
been
the
troublesome
one,
talking
about
in
the
office
were
authorized
or
in
the
office
designated,
but
it
added
the
whole
new
section
and
didn't
changed
3672
very
much
and
added
a
new
subsection
(b)
to
the
effect
you
can
file
this
lien
no
matter
what
the
state
court
provides.
in
summation,
i
should
simply
like
to
restate
my
argument
this
way.
this
problem
since
1955,
no
longer
exist.
the
director
is
not
confronted
with
these.
so
you
were
asked
not
to
go
back
six
years
and
decide
that
law
which
arose
prior
to
1955
should
be
changed
despite
the
fact
that
youngblood
was
on
the
books
and
continued
on
the
books
when
this
mortgage
was
given
and
continued
on
the
books
until
changed
by
congressional
statute.
maniaci
was
in
the
circuit,
our
own
attorney
general
had
made
declarations
and
we
had
decisions
from
our
courts
and
you're
asked
to
change
that.
now,
think
for
a
moment
of
brosnan
and
the
mischief
and
the
habit
that
may
very
well
--
may
very
well-resulted
as
it
affects
the
marketabilities
of
title
and
why
it
should
be
done,
i
do
not
know,
because
the
problem
since
1955
complained
about
by
the
director
no
longer
exist.
so
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
all
of
the
arguments
now
made
maybe
interesting
from
the
academic
standpoint.
since
1955,
the
problem
hasn't
existed
and
there
is
no
reason
to
strike
back
and
re-determine
youngblood
which
in
effect
is
what
you're
asked
to
do.
youngblood
was
never
appealed
from
in
1942
or
1944
by
anyone.
if
it
created
all
this
(inaudible)
from
1944
and
presage
the
devastation
of
government
liens
which
is
now
proclaimed,
why
was
it
not
appealed
from
and
why
do
we
come
to
this
court
now
in
1961?
i
believe
that
muniments
of
title
of
michigan
should
not
thus
be
disturbed
particularly
in
view
that
since
1955,
the
problem
hasn't
existed
for
the
government.
