justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
--
if
i
can
get
my
mind
--
what
in
your
judgment
is
the
federal
law
required
to
the
kind
of
notice
that
is
to
be
given
and
filed
in
recording?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
difference
between
you
and
the
state
that
they
insist
that
under
that
statute,
you
must
describe
the
property
on
which
the
lien
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
claimed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
real
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
argument
is
that
it's
not
necessary
to
describe
the
real
property
that
you
--
it's
enough
for
the
government
simply
to
assert
that
we
have
a
lien
on
everything
this
man
has.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
--
why
have
you
quoted
the
precise
language
of
the
lien
which
congress
says
has
created?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
now,
you
said
congress
says
there
should
be
a
lien,
on
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
cite
that
--
spoke
that
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
has
to
be
considered,
i
suppose,
as
controlled
by
the
other
section
which
authorizes
or
require
whichever
you
wished
to
say,
a
filing
of
the
lien
under
state
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
state
book,
now,
what's
the
precise
language
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
the
difference
between
you
and
them
is
they
insist
that
as
by
law
authorize
the
filing,
that
you
are
required
to
file
it
containing
the
precise
information
which
the
state
has
said
shall
be
considered
to
be
notice
and
nothing
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
was
not
after
acquired
property,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
used
that
as
an
argument
to
show
that
it
was
intended
to
free
the
government
from
setting
out
the
property
owned
by
the
person,
the
taxpayer
in
specific
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
what
you
read
from
on
page
26?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
michigan
have
a
tax
lien?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
have
a
general
tax
lien
which
applies
to
everything
everybody
owns?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright,
could
you
refer
to
that
later?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
a
judgment
lien
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
--
after
its
filed,
after
the
notice
was
given,
do
you
have
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
mortgage
in
michigan
valid
or
invalid?
which
simply
states
that
the
--
to
secure
this
land,
i'd
give
a
mortgage
on
all
the
real
estate
i
own,
wherever
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
to
be
precise
and
certain
under
your
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
be
good
as
between
the
parties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
land
--
this
law
which
is
referred
to
on
page
23,
applies
only
to
tax
liens
to
the
united
states,
where
is
the
law
--
state
law
provides
this
--
makes
this
requirement
of
tax
lien
to
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
title
of
the
michigan
code
we
can
find
that
under?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
get
it
because
i
was
curious
to
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
your
state
law
--
this
relates
only
to
the
federal
government
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
to
know,
what
is
your
law
with
reference
to
tax
liens
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
there's
a
similar
requirement?
