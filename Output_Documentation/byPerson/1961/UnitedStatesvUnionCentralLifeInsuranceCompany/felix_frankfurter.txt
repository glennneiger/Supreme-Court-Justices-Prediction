go

justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
two
questions?
is
susceptible
i
think
of
a
quick
answer.
one,
under
the
--
under
the
lien
statute,
if
the
government
files
a
notice
of
a
lien,
it
then
settle
that
that
carries
with
it
all
after
acquired
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
etcetera?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
statute
or
by
decisions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
did,
not
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
now,
my
next
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
my
next
question
is
this,
if
the
government
files
a
notice
to
property
so
and
so,
defining
the
parcel
of
realty
that
is
--
on
which
it
--
for
which
it
invokes
a
lien,
does
michigan
law
say
that
--
the
government
can
say,
â€œwe
file
--
this
is
a
notice
of
lien
on
property
x,
and
all
after
acquired
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general,
and
that
is
the
decision
of
michigan
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
obsolete
statute
with
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
obsolete
liens
but
obsolete
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
butler,
doesn't
that
bear
on
your
--
fluidity
of
the
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
you
draw
inferences
from
--
as
you
have
every
right
to
it,
do
you
want
to
hear
an
argument
maybe
referenced
to
general
principles
related
to
a
specific
case.
if
you
draw
implications
from
what
--
the
purposes
of
construction,
you
ought
to
consider
what
congress
presumably
was
not
unmindful
of
namely,
we're
living
in
a
commercial
society.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
1955
act
would
indicate
that
congress
seems
to
have
been
--
at
least
have
been
retrogressive
in
the
realization
of
that
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you'll
find
most
of
them
out
on
michigan
tax
cases
(inaudible)?
