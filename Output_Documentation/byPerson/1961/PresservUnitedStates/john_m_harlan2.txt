justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
you're
right
on
that
but
the
subpoena
is
invalid,
what
relevancy
is
that
got
to
this
charge?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
all
the
committee
had
said
--
supposing
there
had
been
no
subpoena
issued
that
the
government
had
proved
that
the
--
that
the
defendant
knew
of
the
committee's
interest
in
these
documents
and
then
what
happened
did
happen.
wouldn't
that
make
out
of
case
under
the
obstruction
of
justice
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
government
investigator
had
a
committee
investigator
and
have
a
conversation
with
the
officers
of
the
union
or
with
this
man
particularly.
where
they'd
arranged
it,
it
would
have
this
material
produced?

(inaudible)
justice
john

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
behalf
of
the
senate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
are
there
some
official
agencies,
administrative
agencies
for
example
that
have
no
power
to
subpoena
(inaudible)
life
services?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
this
statute
was
would
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
go
on
to
cover
them
as
well
as
those
that
have
some
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
ask
you
another
question.how
many
prosecutions,
if
you
know,
had
there
been
under
this
statute
as
distinguished
from
the
companion
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
cases
have
reached
court
of
appeals
level,
do
you
know,
under
this
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
they
all
cases
that
--
where
subpoenas
have
been
issued?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
this
question
that's
raised
now,
has
it
ever
been
litigated
under
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
statute
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
government
concede
the
invalidity
of
the
subpoena?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
persons
to
be
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
served
with
the
subpoena.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
arguing
then
i
take
it,
is
it
necessary
part
of
the
government's
case
under
this
indictment
that
the
subpoena
was
validly
issued?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
no
subpoena
had
been
issued
at
all
and
the
committee
has
instructed
the
investigator
to
go
around
and
tell
mr.
presser
that
he
was
going
to
be
subpoenaed
and
that
they
were
interested
in
his
files
and
he's
been
gerrymandering
this
investigation
and
then
the
same
currencies
have
taken
place.
would
that
have
been
reachable
under
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
documents
are
taken
in
your
own
premise.
i
suppose
these
documents
of
the
subpoena
was
invalidated
you
say,
they
would
have
been
subject
to
a
valid
issued
subpoena,
assuming
the
subpoena
is
valid
and
as
to
the
effect
of
this
conduct
of
presser
at
least
know
that
the
horizon
of
the
committee
intended
the
subpoena
them
and
therefore,
they
discovered
that
their
subpoena
was
invalid
that
they
--
from
the
issue
of
the
valid
subpoena.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
gave
every
evidence
that
you
wanted.
justice
john
m.
harlan
doesn't
the
department
of
justice
and
many
administrative
agencies
frequently
go
and
ask
people
to
submit
their
records
without
necessitating
of
issuing
a
subpoena?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
say
that
this
obstruction
of
justice
statute
in
the
case
of
that
kind
was
not
reach
a
knowing
destruction
of
records
in
the
face
of
an
informal
request
for
the
government
that
they
be
produced.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
the
commission
stands
in
any
different
position
in
this
respect
and
what
the
department
of
justice
or
any
administrative
agency
stands.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course,
technically
the
question
or
objection
well
is
going
for
legal
conclusion.
