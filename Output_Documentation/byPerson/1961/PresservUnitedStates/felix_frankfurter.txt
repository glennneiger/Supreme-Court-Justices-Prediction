justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
it's
from
--
do
you
mean
that
it's
from
the
subpoena
that
he
learnt
that
the
documents
are
relevant
to
the
investigations.
that
outside
of
that
he
didn't
know
or
couldn't
know,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
--
the
subpoena
told
him
what
doc
--
what
documents
were
wanted,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
a
subpoena
is
invalid.
now
what
i'm
asking
is,
could
he
only
derive
knowledge
of
the
desire
of
the
committee
to
have
that
from
the
subpoena
or
would
the
subpoena
alone
tell
him
that
those
documents
are
relevant
in
outside
of
what
the
invalid
subpoena
from
your
point
of
view
told
them,
he
wouldn't
know
that
they
were
relevant?
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
somebody
called
him
up
on
the
telephone
and
said
we're
going
to
send
somebody
around.
the
subpoena
will
be
served
on
you
and
--
in
tomorrow
in
two
hours.
and
i'll
tell
you
now
so
you
might
get
ready
for
the
things,
he
wants
this
--
in
these
documents
and
he
then
destroys
them.
would
that
be
within
the
statute?
no
subpoena
outs
--
outstanding
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
no
more
than
what
i've
given
you.
the
committee
called
him
up
and
said,
we
just
assured
you,
determined
as
just
of
the
--
the
sub-chairman
is
best
to
have
signed
the
subpoena
and
an
investigator
is
on
the
way
to
get
you
on
about
two
hours
outside
the
country
somewhere
and
he
thought
of
a
million
opportunities
to
get
the
documents
together.
he
has
no
--
the
subpoena
hasn't
reached
him
and
he
then
does
away
with
the
documents.
would
that
be
within
or
without
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
with
mccracken?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
do
with
mccracken,
the
mccracken
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
no.
they
--
there
was
no
--
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
i
haven't
looked
at
the
case.
my
memory
may
betray
me.
but
mccracken
wasn't
served
with
a
subpoena
was
it,
some
other
people
were?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
invalidity
of
the
subpoena,
wipe
out
the
practical
knowledge
which
he
derived
from
this
invalid
piece
of
paper.
does
that
sponge
out
the
information
it
conveys
to
him
that
the
committee
wanted
these
documents
as
a
practical
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
may
legally
but
does
it
--
because
i
know
a
piece
of
paper
was
invalidly
issued
therefore
have
i
derived
no
knowledge
upon
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
what
she
was
--
under
which
he
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
to
the
chief
justice
--
did
you
answer
the
chief
justice
that
you
don't
contend
it
outs
--
it
is
outside
of
prohibition
of
the
proscription
of
whether
corruptly,
obstructor
indeed,
what
did
you
say
to
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
seeking
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
you
--
may
i
infer
from
what
you
said
that
you're
not
making
--
you're
not
directing
yourself
consideration
to
what
the
corruptly
means
in
that
context.
so
i
infer
--
may
i
infer
from
what
you
said
that
it
corruptly
means
having
no
justifiable
--
willfully
seeking
to
despoil
some
documents
that
a
committee
wants,
would
that
take
care
of
corrupting,
whether
corruptly
--
corruptly
doesn't
mean
usually
has
nothing
to
do
with
money
especially.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
if
a
man
--
that
it
would
cover
corruptly
if
with
the
view
to
despoiling
with
the
view
of
making
impossible
the
availability
of
the
document,
he
just
destroyed
it
for
that
purpose
that
would
be
corruptly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
he
could
be
a
potential
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
(inaudible)
by
the
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the

that
right?
