mr.
john
cardinal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
argued
on
the
general
docket
in
the
spring
that
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
go
through
the
facts
briefly
once
again.
as
you
may
recall
it's
an
indictment
and
conviction
for
the
violation
of
title
18,
1505
of
the
us
code.
the
facts
which
led
up
to
the
indictment
of
the
petitioner
are
briefly
and
they
begin
with
the
filing
or
the
serving
of
a
petition
purportedly
that
of
the
mcclellan
committee
on
the
petitioner
on
march
21,
1958.
the
subpoena
--
i'm
sorry,
i
might
have
said
the
petition,
it
was
the
subpoena
that
was
served
on
mr.
presser,
called
for
the
all
of
the
records
of
joint
council
41
which
is
the
--
an
affiliation
of
the
ohio
conference
of
teamsters
for
the
northeastern
and
southeastern
parts
of
ohio,
for
a
period
of
approximately
10
years
from
july
--
from
january
1,
1959
until
january
1,
1958.
immediately
following
the
service
of
this
subpoena
upon
mr.
presser,
it
was
affected
with
the
committee's
field
office
in
cleveland
an
arrangement
whereby
the
accountants
and
attorneys
for
joint
council
41
gave
to
the
field
office
personnel,
those
records
demanded
by
the
subpoena
and
for
which
the
field
office
receipted.
this
arrangement
continued
until
at
least
september
5
of
1958
at
which
time
sheridan
who
had
served
the
subpoena
on
mr.
presser,
again
returned
to
cleveland
and
served
a
subpoena
upon
koza
and
stoyer,
the
accountants
and
lawyers
for
joint
council
45,
demanding
that
the
office
files
of
that
firm
as
they
pertain
to
joint
council
41
were
to
be
displayed
in
washington
on
september
9,
five-four
days
from
that
day.
on
september
9,
sheridan
again
returned
to
cleveland
and
went
to
the
office
of
joint
council
41
where
he
testified
that
in
as
much
as
he
was
aware
that
some
of
the
files
had
not
been
turned
over
to
the
field
office,
he
attempted
to
examine
those
files
still
in
joint
council
41's
office
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
should
have
been.
after
some
conversation
with
mr.
presser,
the
files
--
the
cabinets
in
the
office
were
turned
over
to
mr.
sheridan
and
he
examined
those
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
and
determined
that
he
would
take
four
particular
files.
in
one
of
these
files,
there
were,
according
to
his
testimony,
two
documents,
one
an
invoice
known
as
the
doich
invoice
and
its
ex
--
the
government's
exhibit
12
upon
which
there
were
listed
eight
names.
the
invoice
was
the
counsel's
receipt
for
the
purchase
of
eight
champagne
buckets.
on
the
other
document,
was
a
list
of
names
which
included
the
eight
on
the
doich
invoice
but
other
names
behind
which
were
listed
certain
items
known
to
the
investigator
to
have
been
sums
of
money
for
or
gifts,
christmas
gifts.
these
were
contained
in
an
envelope
marked
x-mas
list.
mr.
presser
testified
that
he
wanted
a
receipt
for
the
four
files
that
were
taken
out.
because
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour,
mr.
sheridan
said
i
can't
do
that,
i
will
be
back
and
they
by
mutual
agreement,
agreed
to
have
the
files
photostated
and
sheridan
was
to
return
on
the
13
and
pick
up
the
photostated
copies.
mr.
sheridan's
testimony
was
that
there
was
no
testimony
--
no
conversation
concerning
a
receipt
that
mr.
presser
said
that
he
would
not
let
them
go
out
until
they
were
photostated.
at
any
way,
on
the
13th
of
september,
sheridan
again
returned
the
office
and
joint
council
41,
look
through
the
files,
and
found
that
the
doich
invoice
had
been
mutilated
to
exclude
the
eight
names
listed
on
the
left-hand
corner
and
the
list
which
include
those
eight
names
and
others,
was
missing.
he
immediately
made
some
remark
to
mr.
presser
and
presser
was
too
have
said,
“you
have
your
job
to
do,
i
have
mine.”
mr.
sheridan
left,
taking
the
files,
giving
no
receipts
and
testified
before
his
committee
on
september
17th
concerning
this
incident.
now
a
year-and-a-half
later
on
march
23,
1960,
mr.
presser
was
indicted
for
obstructing
the
committee
in
its
investigation
and
according
to
the
indictment
that
the
allegations
are
that
the
committee
at
that
time
at
all
times
material
to
the
indictment
was
duly
in
the
due
and
proper
exercise
of
its
investigative
powers
pursuant
to
its
authorizing
resolution
and
that
in
accordance
with
its
own
rules
of
procedure,
issued
the
subpoena
demanding
the
documents
which
the
petitioner
knew
were
relevant
to
the
committee's
investigation
and
were
demanded
by
the
subpoena.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
sheridan
took
the
stand
and
in
the
course
of
cross-examination
of
mr.
sheridan,
it
was
brought
out
that
the
subpoena
which
was
served
on
the
petitioner
on
march
21
of
1958
was
in
all
likelihood
prepared
in
cleveland.
that
the
subpoena
was
signed,
the
blank
subpoena
was
signed
by
senator
mcclellan,
chairman
of
the
mcclellan
committee
and
was
addressed
by
and
filled
in,
the
substance
of
the
subpoena
filled
in
by
employees
in
the
field
office
in
cleveland.
now
senator
mcclellan
also
had
taken
the
stand
and
with
respect
to
the
organization
of
the
committee
stated
with
fairly
good
specificity
the
subpoena
power
of
the
committee,
nothing
was
said
concerning
this
particular
subpoena.
however,
the
likelihood
of
sheridan's
testimony
was
further
bolstered
when
the
supplemental
subpoena
issued
on
april
1
and
in
the
record
as
defendant's
exhibit
a
was
without
qualification
signed
by
the
senator
in
blank
and
issued
to
--
and
issued
by
the
field
personnel.
now
at
that
point
in
the
trial,
we
asked
the
court,
we
move
the
court
to
quash
the
subpoena
and
the
indictment
and
discharge
the
defendant.
on
that
particular
point,
the
trial
court
held
that
this
subpoena
was
valid
and
later
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
valid,
but
that
no
subpoena
was
necessary
in
this
instance.
now
our
contention
is
that
under
the
indictment
and
under
the
processes
of
the
committee,
the
committee
had
to
be
in
the
--
in
order
to
be
in
the
due
and
proper
exercise
of
its
investigative
powers
had
to
have
issued
a
valid
subpoena
for
the
production
of
these
documents.
that
the
--
mr.
john
cardinal
it's
because
of
the
indictment
and
because
of
the
rules
of
procedure
of
the
committee
itself.
there
is
rule
four
of
the
rules
of
procedure
provides
that
the
chairman
has
the
right
to
issue
subpoenas
or
he
has
the
right
to
delegate
that
authority
to
a
member
of
the
committee,
providing
that
authority
is
delegated
in
writing.
so
that
issuance
we
contend
provides
not
only
the
signing
of
a
subpoena,
but
includes
the
address
that
would
be
the
subject
to
whom
the
subpoena
is
addressed
and
the
documents
or
the
person's
body
who
is
demanded
before
the
committee.
the
fact
that
issuance
has
a
greater
connotation
than
merely
signing
the
blank
subpoena
is
recognized
at
page
26
of
the
government's
brief.
and
in
as
much
as
the
committee
in
this
instance
purported
to
act
through
its
coercive
power
of
the
subpoena,
we
contend
that
the
voluntary
turning
over
of
these
documents
cannot
later
validate
original
an
originally
void
process.
we
also
contend
contrary
to
the
government
that
such
a
process
cannot
then
be
ratified
by
the
committee
because
the
committee
in
this
case
instance,
in
this
particular
instance,
could
not
have
delegated
to
sheridan
or
any
employee
the
power
to
make
cogent
or
validate
a
blank
piece
of
paper
signed
by
senator
mcclellan.
we
contend
therefore
that
the
trial
court
was
in
error
that
the
--
in
not
discharging
the
defendant,
that
the
committee
was
not
in
its
due
and
proper
exercise
of
the
investigative
power
authorized
under
its
authorizing
resolution,
senate
resolution
74.
it
was
in
violation
of
its
own
rules
of
procedure
that
the
subpoena
was
not
a
defective
process,
it
was
a
void
process
and
that
the
void
process
cannot
be
validated
by
ratification
because
it
could
not
have
been
delegated
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
john
cardinal
that
is
our
position
your
honor,
that
it
had
to
be
a
valid
process
of
the
committee.
mr.
john
cardinal
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
it
would
have.
i
don't
think
that
the
--i
think
that
for
otherwise
as
required
and
it's
argued
by
the
government,
the
manner
in
which
the
committee
could
obtain
witnesses
and
documents.
mr.
john
cardinal
yes,
sir.
that's
right
your
honor
but
i
was
attempting
to
answer
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
i
don't
think
that
in
the
circumstances
that
you
put
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner
would
have
been
in
violation
of
1505
unless
he
voluntarily
appears.
i
believe
that
he
--
if
he
voluntarily
appears
before
the
commission
--
the
committee
and
in
a
sense
subjects
himself
to
its
jurisdiction
that
that
isn't
broken
by
something
that
transpires
there
merely
because
he's
not
under
subpoena.
i
do
believe
that
the
committee
might
take
some
action
by
resolution
or
otherwise
which
could
place
him
in
a
position
where
he
was
bound
to
comply.
mr.
john
cardinal
well,
i
attempted
to
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
believe
that
they
have
the
right,
the
committee
has
the
right
to
obtain
documents
and
to
obtain
information
from
witnesses
either
through
the
compulsory
power
of
the
subpoena
or
otherwise
and
i
think
or
otherwise
is
some
voluntary
submission
to
the
committee's
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
cardinal
i
don't
believe
that
that
would.
mr.
john
cardinal
i
think
that
in
a
situation
where
the
petitioner
may
have
voluntarily
subjected
those
files
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
--
and
that
would
be
a
fact
question,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
legal
answer
would
be.
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
if
there
had
been
no
subpoena,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
petitioner
would
be
in
violation
of
1505.
i
don't
--
mr.
john
cardinal
in
all
candor
i
would
say
no.
mr.
john
cardinal
well,
i
think
that
in
one
respect
that
assumes
that
the
committee
would
want
them.
mr.
john
cardinal
well
of
course
our
contention
is
that
the
committee
has
never
acted
in
this
case
up
to
the
time
and
including
the
time
of
the
indictment.
but
--
mr.
john
cardinal
i
think
that
he
was
an
authorized
investigator
of
the
committee.
his
duties
were
outlined
by
senator
mcclellan.
but,
his
duties
were
not
to
germinate
blank
pieces
of
paper
into
subpoenas.
mr.
john
cardinal
yes.
mr.
john
cardinal
i
think
that's
my
position
which
probably
hasn't
been
made
clear
if
i
believe
that
if
sheridan
under
the
same
circumstances
had
gone
in
and
said,
“we're
going
to
want
these
records”
and
the
petitioner
said,
“well,
i'm
going
to
burn
them”
and
he
does
burn
them
and
they're
later
subpoenaed
that
there
is
no
violation
of
1505.
i
believe
conversely
if
the
committee
evidences
in
some
way
other
--
mr.
john
cardinal
well
that
presents
a
close
question
but
i
think
that
the
further
you
get
to
the
official
act
of
the
committee's
acting
into
the
thing,
that
then
you
don't
read
what
it
really
required
then
you
get
full
scope
of
otherwise.
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
john
cardinal
no,
there
are
many.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
cases
apart
from
the
one
that
we
have
right
here
indicated
that
such
a
note
would
have
no
legal
effect.
i
don't
know
in
this
area
--
mr.
john
cardinal
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
have
no
knowledge
--
mr.
john
cardinal
there
is
none
in
this
record
of
practice
other
than
in
this
case,
that's
right.
mr.
john
cardinal
i
understand
they
do
but
that
was
from
only
--
only
from
the
briefs
of
the
government.
mr.
john
cardinal
to
my
knowledge
mr.
justice
black,
there
isn't
any,
but
there
may
be
one.
mr.
john
cardinal
i
think
that
that's
true.
mr.
john
cardinal
on
those
facts,
i
don't
think
that
the
committee
has
officially
acted
in
it.
i
don't
believe.
mr.
john
cardinal
well,
i
think
implemented
by
statute,
they
do
stand
in
a
different
sense.
i
think
that
it's
a
delegation
of
the
power.
mr.
john
cardinal
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
cardinal
i
don't
know
of
any
your
honor.
mr.
john
cardinal
i
don't
know
of
that
any.
i
don't
know
of
any
such
case.
if
i
have
any
time
left
your
honor,
i
might
use
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
cardinal
your
honor,
i
had
intended
to.
we
believe
that
the
evidence
of
senator
mcclellan
was
wholly
erroneous
in
this
instance,
in
this
case
broken
down
his
testimony
was
organizational,
a
recitation
from
what
was
described
is
the
interim
report,
the
recitation
from
the
committee's
report
and
certain
conclusions
that
he
drew
from
this
testimony.
now
the
government
attempted
to
justify
all
of
these
evidences
on
the
ground
that
it
tended
to
show
that
the
committee
was
really
investigating
under
its
authorizing
resolution
that
the
names
on
the
documents
were
pertinent
to
that
inquiry
and
knowledge
of
the
petitioner
to
the
fact
that
the
committee
wanted
those
names.
now
we
believe
that
following
the
organizational
testimony
of
senator
mcclellan,
the
entire
evidence
of
the
senator
was
self
serving.
he
begins
by
relating
the
special
findings
of
this
committee
to
certain
members
of
the
teamster's
union
and
certain
other
persons
not
connected
with
the
teamsters
union
which
are
supposed
to
have
apprised
the
petitioner
that
the
bad
character
of
those
people
which
are
read
into
the
record
at
pages
42
through
46
that
the
committee
was
going
to
want
the
names
listed
on
this
invoice.
he
also
was
permitted
to
check
or
read
the
committee's
report
of
sheridan's
testimony
concerning
his
visit
to
the
joint
council
41
office
before
the
committee
on
september
17th,
that
would
be
four
days
following
his
leaving
cleveland.
now
the
testimony
before
the
committee
by
sheridan
was
given
under
two
subpoenas
neither
one
of
which
is
the
one
that
forms
the
basis
of
the
indictment.
so
that
when
sheridan
then
came
on
to
testify,
the
testimony
of
senator
mcclellan
has
already
said
has
placed
before
the
jury
that
this
testimony
does
indicate
that
the
committee
was
deprived
of
evidence
which
would
have
--
documents
which
did
impede
the
inquiry
of
the
--
of
the
committee.
mr.
john
cardinal
that
was
one
of
the
grounds
that
they
attempted
to
justify
it
on.
it
--
grounds
that
these
names
listed
on
the
invoice
were
pertinent
because
the
special
findings
that
had
been
concluded
by
the
committee
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
served
upon
the
petitioner
where
in
some
form
some
manner
connected
with
the
teamster's
union.
the
petitioner
was
neither
called
before
the
committee
at
that
time.
none
of
the
people
other
than
this
christmas
gift
--
list
were
all
known
to
him.
he
was
not
present
and
the
entire
findings
of
the
committee
were
in
a
form
of
ex
parte
entered
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
john
cardinal
the
evidence
of
all
of
these
was
subjected
too
repeatedly.
particularly
the
interim
report
which
at
first
was
sustained,
the
objection
was
sustained
then
the
senator
said,
“the
reason
we
want
these
names
are
pertinent
is
that
we
are
interested
in
the
use
of
the
union
funds
for
the
payment
of
christmas
gifts.
the
trial
judge
let
it
in
for
that
purpose.
it's
a
completely
none
secretive
because
he
talks
about
the
rise
of
dorfman
to
a
power
of
eminence
in
the
insurance
field
after
the
death
of
his
predecessor
referring
that
maybe
the
petitioner
had
something
to
do
with
dorfman's
predecessor's
death.
that
was
led
in
for
that
specific
purpose
at
the
time
that
the
counsel
went
over
the
exhibits
that
went
into
the
record.
the
court
at
page
212
and
213
of
the
record
refused
to
let
the
interim
report
go
to
the
jury
because
he
said
he
did
not
feel
that
it
was
pertinent,
material
to
the
matters
that
we
have
here.
but
you
may
argue
it
and
argue
with
the
prosecutor
did
because
at
335,
he
points
out,
i
think
it's
335,
i'm
not
sure
of
that
page,
points
out
that
the
reason
the
put
this
in
was
to
show
that
presser
had
knowledge
that
they
were
investigating
these
men
and
therefore
tore
the
invoice.
