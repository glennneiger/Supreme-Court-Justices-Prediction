justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
medalie?
the
statutory
language,
is
this
what
you
have
referenced
to?
the
due
and
proper
exercise
of
the
power
of
inquiry,
is
that
what
you
mean
by
duly
authorized?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
may
i
ask
as
to
that?
what
if
the
government's
burden,
the
prosecution
under
this
section
in
respect
of
that
element?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
i
will
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
government
have
a
view
as
to
what
its
burden
is
if
that
be
an
element
of
the
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
irrespective
of
that,
i
take
it
that
this
means
--
at
least
this
much
doesn't
it?
that
the
committee
activity
involved
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
in
connection
with
something
which
can
be
agreed
to
be
or
how
much
conclusion
can
be
reached
that
that
something,
that
inquiry
was
an
inquiry
in
the
due
and
proper
exercise
of
the
power
of
inquiry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
some
(inaudible)
question
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
the
determination
whether
or
not
the
particular
inquiry
to
which
this
effort
to
get
these
papers
related
was
a
due
and
proper
exercise
of
power
of
inquiry,
a
question
of
law
or
of
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
for
the
judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
it
handled
in
this
case
as
a
question
of
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
but
i
suppose
mr.
medalie,
this
would
be
true
if
one
corruptly
impedes
on
inquiry
which
has
not
in
the
due
and
proper
exercise
to
the
power
of
inquiry
there'd
be
no
offense
under
the
statute,
could
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
medalie,
was
senator
mcclellan's
testimony
offered
any
question
except
that
of
--
you've
been
using
the
word
purpose,
an
equal
purpose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
on
what
ground
was
the
objection,
if
any
was
taken
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
senator
mcclellan's
testimony?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
--
you
told
us
i
think
that
at
no
time
was
it
said,
"well
if
the
testimony
is
to
be
taken,
it
should
be
taken
out
of
the
presence
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
you're
saying
is
under
1503
the
fellow
intimidated
must
be
a
witness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
under
this
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
cudahy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
arguing
mr.
cardinal
that
in
fact
there
was
an
objection
that
taking
this
testimony
in
the
presence
of
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
can't
give
us
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
some
ref

beg
your
pardon?
