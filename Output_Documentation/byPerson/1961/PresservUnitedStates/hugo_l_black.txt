know
of

for
destroying

in

the

there
is
none.
justice

do
i
understand
correctly

appeals
sustained
this
conviction
on
the
basis
that
it
could
be
sustained
even
though
there
has
been
no

on
the

effect
that
this

any

he

you're

weren't

justice

i'm
just
asking
for
information.
justice

i'm
familiar
[inaudible]
in
practice,
you
should
take
it
up
with
people
and
say
we're
going
to
want
them,
we'd
rather
give
it
to
him
without
a
subpoena.
you
can't
get
him
without
a
subpoena
unless
you've
agree
to
it.
we're
asking
you
to
let
this
happen
and
if
they
don't
give
them
a
subpoena
but
there's
any
--
are
there
any
cases
if
you
know
of
anywhere
that
people
who
have
been
convicted
for
doing
something
with
papers
before
they
were
subpoenaed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
pretty
important
thing,
isn't
it?
it
has
been
in
the
history
of
the
law,
hasn't
it,
if
that
came
into
the
subpoena.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
much
interested
in
your
written
[inaudible]
because
i
don't
know
what
it
is
now.
you
mean
that
if
the
committee
decided
and
want
to
investigate
what
is
the
motive,
and
notifying
that
they
wanted
to
investigate
their
private
papers,
books,
letters,
and
so
forth
and
from
that
time
on,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
law
based
on
[inaudible]
if
so,
where
is
the
statute
that
would
justify
such
an
unusual
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
they
have
abided
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
they
have
private
papers
use
in
the
conduct
could
have
been
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'd
like
to
discuss
is
rather
fully
and
i
think
why.
i
have
issued
a
lot
of
subpoena.
before
issuing
and
trying
to
get
a
piece
of
paper
even
when
i
wanted
them
to
consent
i
carefully
drew
up
what
was
i
consider
to
be
a
valid
subpoena,
gave
it
to
him
and
notified
him
and
told
him
that
a
great
deal
of
time
could
be
saved
if
they
would
simply
let
our
people
look
at
it.
and
say
wanted
to,
they
can
look
at
it
there
and
didn't
have
to
go
to
the
extent
and
trouble
bring
it
up.
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
at
this
time,
i
do
not
know
that
anyone
saw
that
we
could
preempt
people
from
doing
what
they
feel
with
that
papers
merely
by
notifying
that
we
would
want
them
in
the
future.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
were
going
far
enough
to
suggest
that
without
a
subpoena
you
could
do
this.
does
your
case
depends
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
more
prosecutions
where
they
destroyed
them
after
and
i
had
something
to
do
with
one
where
they
would
destroy
after
subpoena
was
served.
but
are
there
any
cases
anywhere
that
you
have
in
your
brief
that
people
have
been
convicted
for
destroying
papers
and
what
they
deliberately
with
those
papers
merely
because
they've
been
notified
but
permitted
that
they
would
want
them
sometime
in
the
future.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
may
have
been
done.
i'm
asking
because
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
wholly
unfamiliar
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
that
case
and
what
did
he
rely
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
raises
a
different
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understood,
it
seemed
to
me
this
court
below
decided
this
case
and
your
argument
rested
on
the
assumption
that
without
any
statute
and
more
definitely
this
one
1507,
when
a
committee
informs
the
man
in
business
that
he
has
got
to
hold
his
papers,
because
the
committee
would
want
him
in
the
future
that
if
he
does
what
he
pleases
with
his
papers,
you
can
be
tried
as
a
criminal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh
there's
a
knowledge
that
is
it
your
position
to
be
knowledge
on
the
part
of
a
business
that
they
wanted
paper
or
sufficient
to
prevent
his
destroying
without
becoming
a
criminal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
subpoena
in
order
to
object
to
his
papers
to
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
that's
a
different
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happens
if
the
case
as
to
the
opinion
written
by
judge
weinfeld?
justice
hugo
l.
black
stopped,
you
know
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
not
convicted.
this
is
not
pertaining
to
the
victim,
it
didn't
go
up
in
the
higher
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
you
to
say
it
that
you
thought
it
would
be
a
valid
process
and
you
know
just
sign
the
subpoenas
in
blank,
not
on
this
the
subordinate
to
fill
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
england
[inaudible],
wouldn't
it?
