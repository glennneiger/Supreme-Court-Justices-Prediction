mr.
john
g.
cardinal
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
may
i
begin
by
stating
briefly
the
facts
that
gave
rise
to
this
case.
this
is
a
case
which
involves
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
under
section
1505
of
title
18,
generally
referred
to
as
obstruction
of
justice
sections
of
the
--
of
the
code.
the
petitioner
was
indicted
on
march
23,
1960.
and
on
april
1,
1960,
he
was
arraigned
and
pleaded
not
guilty.
he
came
on
for
trial
on
may
31
of
1960.
and
on
june
the
7th,
the
jury
returned
the
unanimous
--
unanimous
verdict
of
guilty.
the
court
overruled
the
petitioner's
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
and
the
judgment
on
the
verdict,
and
the
appeal
was
taken
to
the
sixth
circuit
--
sixth
circuit
on
april
24th
of
last
year,
unanimously
affirmed
the
action
of
the
trial
court.
the
fact
situation,
circumstances
which
gave
rise
to
the
petitioner's
indictment
were
briefly
these,
the
transcript,
i
believe,
fairly
shows
that
walter
sheridan,
a
--
an
investigator
for
the
committee
involved
in
this
case,
the
select
committee
in
--
in
investigating
improper
and
criminal
activities
in
the
labor
management
relation
field,
went
to
the
officers
of
joint
council
41,
on
march
21,
1958,
served
upon
the
petitioner
as
president
of
joint
council
41,
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
the
subpoena
required
the
production
of
all
of
the
documents
of
joint
council
41
for
a
period
of
nine
years
preceding
january
1
of
1958
before
the
committee
in
washington
forthwith,
following
the
service
of
this
subpoena,
representatives
of
joint
council
41,
not
employees
of
joint
council
41
except
as
accountants,
began
complying
with
the
subpoena
by
de
--
depositing
the
demanded
documents
in
the
field
office
at
cleveland
which
had
been
established
by
two
employees
of
the
committee
for
the
convenience
of
the
production
of
documents
and
these
employees
were
not
the
same
employee
that
served
the
subpoena.
on
september
the
9th,
the
same
employee,
the
investigator,
walter
sheridan,
again
went
to
the
officers
of
joint
council
41
and
asked
to
see
certain
correspondents
files
which
he
understood
from
his
conversations
with
the
field
office
personnel
had
not
been
produced
to
the
field
office
in
cleveland.
when
he
finally
finished
his
examination
of
these
files,
he
indicated
to
the
petitioner
that
he
would
like
to
take
four
folders
--
four
file
folders
with
him.
now
at
the
time
that
the
field
office
had
been
established,
mr.
(inaudible)
and
ms.
thorpe,
both
employees
of
the
committee,
had
established
the
practice
of
receding
for
the
documents
that
the
representatives
of
joint
council
41
had
turned
over
to
the
field
office
so
that
on
the
day,
september
9,
1958
when
the
investigator,
sheridan,
demanded
the
four
files
which
it
was
claimed
were
required
to
be
produced
under
the
subpoena,
the
petitioner
asked
for
receipts
in
compliance
with
the
practice
that
was
then
in
existence
with
the
field
office.
at
this
point,
there
is
some
conflict
as
to
the
--
as
to
what
happened.
but
sheridan's
version
of
the
testimony,
i
mean
what
happened
was
the
petitioner
demanded
that
the
documents
all
before
photostatted
before
they'd
be
removed
from
the
office
of
joint
council
41.
the
petitioner's
version
of
that
episode
is
that
the
petitioner
himself
was
quite
willing
to
have
given
the
--
the
documents
and
did
give
the
documents
but
all
wanted
a
receipt
and
that
through
the
lateness
of
the
hour
that
then
being
almost
closing
time,
the
petitioner
or
investigator
suggested
photostatting.
now,
during
the
course
of
this
trial,
when
sheridan
took
the
stand,
he
was
cross-examined
regarding
the
subpoena
that
was
served
upon
the
petitioner
on
march
21,
1958.
his
evidence
which
constitutes
the
only
affirmative
evidence
in
the
record
concerning
this
particular
subpoena
was
that
it
was,
in
all
likelihood,
prepared
in
cleveland
by
some
personnel
of
the
committee,
not
the
chairman,
although
the
subpoena
was
signed
in
blank
by
the
chairman.
now,
it's
upon
those
facts
and
the
resolution
authorizing
the
investigative
power
of
the
committee
together
with
the
committee's
own
rules
and
procedure
that
forms
a
basis
of
our
first
contention
and
that
is
that
the
petitioner
could
not
have
been
in
violation
of
any
of
the
provisions
of
1505
and
could
not
have
obstructed
the
investigative
powers
of
the
committee.
the
indictment
itself
charges
that
the
petitioner
withheld
mutilated
and
destroyed
two
documents.
the
documents
were
observed
by
sheridan
the
fir
--
on
his
first
visit
to
joint
council
41
office
on
september
9,
1958,
when
he
returned
to
pick
the
documents
up,
following
there,
having
been
photostatted.
two
of
the
documents
were
missing.
one,
an
envelope
marked
christmas
list
and
a
piece
of
paper,
yellow
paper,
which
contains
certain
names
back
of
which
were
indications
of
a
gift
or
sums
of
money.
there
was
another
document,
an
invoice
which
indicated
the
purchase
of
eight
champagne
buckets
from
the
rudolph
deutsch
company
and
on
the
one
corner
of
this
invoice
were
listed
eight
names.
these,
sheridan
observed
on
september
9th,
when
he
retuned
on
september
the
13th,
the
envelope
in
the
sheet
of
paper
were
missing
and
the
invoice
had
been
mutilated
to
the
extent
that
these
eight
names
were
missing,
had
been
torn
off
and
part
--
partially
erased.
now,
it's
with
the
--
the
effacement,
the
mutilation
and
the
concealment
of
those
two
documents
--
three
documents
that
the
petitioner
was
indicted
for
having
obstructed
the
investigative
power
of
the
committee.
indictment
charges
that
the
committee
pursuant
to
its
authorizing
resolutions
and
its
own
rules
of
procedure
had
duly
subpoenaed
the
documents
of
joint
council
41.
senate
resolution
74,
which
is
the
authorizing
resolution
of
this
committee,
provides
that
the
committee
may
demand
documents
which
it
deems
necessary
to
its
investigation
by
the
use
of
subpoena
or
otherwise
and
further
provides
that
the
committee
shall
organize
and
adopt
rules
of
procedure
not
inconsistent
with
the
rules
of
the
senate.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
there
was
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
he
had
them
in
his
--
his
office.
there
was
some
attempt
at
the
trial
to
--
to
show
that
the
recording
secretary
was
officially
the
custodian
of
the
records
but
the
recording
secretary's
office
was
not
in
the
office
where
the
actual
files
were
kept.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
he
was
the
president
of
joint
council
41.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
joint
council
41
is
an
administrative
unit
of
the
teamsters
union
composed
of
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
well,
it's
in
the
--
in
the
ohio
area.
it's
composed
of
local
unions
affiliated
to
make
this
joint
council.
and
there
are
three
in
ohio,
joint
council
41,
generally
covers
the
northern,
eastern
and
part
of
the
southeastern
portions.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
of
the
state.
and
then
there
are
two
other
joint
councils
in
the
state.
those
three
councils
go
together
to
make
up
what
is
known
as
the
ohio
conference
of
teamsters.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
and
presser
was
president
of
joint
council
41.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
question
about
that.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
upon
the
organization
of
the
committee,
it
did
adopt
rules
of
practice
and
procedure
which
provided
that
the
chairman
had
the
right
to
exercise
the
subpoena
power
for
the
committee
and
also
provided
that
any
member
of
the
committee
could
exercise
the
subpoena
power
provided
his
authority
was
evidence
in
writing
by
the
--
by
the
chairman.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record,
and
from
the
statement
of
the
prosecutor,
there
is
no
evidence
available
that
the
chairman
at
any
time
authorized
any
member
of
the
committee
in
writing
to
exercise
the
subpoena
power
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
committee.
the
evidence
is
that,
in
all
likelihood,
this
subpoena
served
upon
joint
council
41
was
signed
in
blank
because
that
was
the
testimony
of
sheridan
who
testified
on
that
subject
that
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
there
--
there
is
no
specific
statement
that
it
--
that
actually
happened.
the
nearest
thing
to
anything
--
any
testimony
on
that
was
sheridan's
testimony
and
he
said
in
one
place,
in
all
likelihood,
that
it
was
done
--
signed
in
blank
and
another
place
that
the
chances
are
that
it
was.
but
that's
as
close
to
the
direct
evidence
on
that
particular
point.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
was
not.
no.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
yes.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
no,
he
didn't
testify
as
to
that
practice.
his
testimony
was
that
he
had
the
authority
to
issue
subpoenas
and
that
generally
in
the
investigative
process
of
--
of
this
committee,
he
did
issue
subpoenas,
whether
or
not
they
were
signed
in
blank
and
filled
in
or
prepared
by
investigators
or
other
employees
of
the
committee,
was
not
touched
in
his
testimony.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
no,
he
was
not
asked
that
specific
question.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
friday
before
we
had
recessed,
i
had
related
the
facts
upon
which
i've
been
concluded
that
the
mcclellan
committee
as
we
viewed
the
situation
was
not
in
its
proper
exercise
--
doing
proper
exercise
of
its
investigated
powers
and
that
therefore
couldn't
be
no
violation
of
section
1505.
bases
for
our
conclusions
and
the
reasons
therefore
we
feel
are
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
compulsory
process
of
the
committee
is
a
deligation
of
a
power
from
congress
which
must
be
strictly
construed
to
have
any
valid
invocation
of
that
power
against
one
whom
the
power
is
asserted.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
would
be
that
the
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
think
assuming
that
if
he
knew
under
circumstances
that
the
section
1505
does
include
situations
that
are
not
involving
the
compulsory
process.
however,
in
this
instance,
the
committee
was
attempting
to
proceed,
to
obtain
documents
through
the
compulsory
process
and
the
knowledge
that
would
be
obtainable
or
would
be
referable
to
the
petitioner
or
to
joint
council
41
must
necessarily
come
from
that
subpoena.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
but
the
petitioner
in
joint
council
41
ought
to
have
the
right
to
rely
upon
the
efficacy
of
what
was
extensively
a
valid
process.
in
this
instance,
it
was
not
the
process
of
the
committee
but
was
the
officious
act
of
an
investigator.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
frankfurter
whether
you
mean
the
petitioner
or
the
investigator?
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
that's
--
that's
my
position.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
think
of
the
fee
submitted
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
committee
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
think
it's
with
without
the
criminal
statute.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
where
the
--
pardon?
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
there
was
an
absolute
refusal.
there
is
no
refusal
with
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
in
this
instance,
i
think
the
distinction
is
that
the
subpoena
is
not
returnable
to
a
judicial
officer
to
whom
objections
maybe
taken.
i
believe
also
that
an
extensively
valid
subpoena
should
warrant
the
petitioner's
reliance
upon
that
validity.
but
if
in
fact
it
is
a
void
subpoena
that
the
committee
has
not
been
acting
and
is
not
acting
and
that
therefore,
the
petitioner
or
any
other
accused
is
not
in
violation
of
1505
or
obstructing
the
due
and
proper
power
of
inquiry
by
that
committee.
the
situation
does
not
--
is
not
different
then,
those
situations
which
have
existed
in
unlawful
searches
and
seizures
where
the
act
of
the
official
survey
is
completely
void.
the
voidness
of
the
--
or
i
should
say
the
voidability
of
the
process
is
pervasively
infects
the
action
with
which
they
attempt
to
proceed.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
in
my
opinion,
it
does.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
morally,
maybe
no.
but
as
--
as
an
official
act
in
the
committee,
there
is
no
knowledge.
if
in
fact
the
action
ultimately
becomes
valid,
there
maybe
some
knowledge
attributable
to
that
accused
but
not
by
virtue
of
the
process,
by
the
virtue
of
the
circumstance
which
later
occurs.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
whoever
corruptly
or
by
threats
or
force
or
by
any
threatening
letter
or
communication
influences,
obstructs
or
impedes
or
endeavors
to
influence
or
obstruct
or
in
impede
to
do
any
proper
administration
of
the
law
under
which
such
proceeding
is
being
had
before
such
department
or
agency
of
the
united
states.
or
to
do
in
proper
exercise
of
the
power
of
inquiry
under
which
such
inquiry
or
investigation
is
being
had
by
either
house
or
any
committee
of
either
house
or
any
joint
committee
of
the
congress
shall
be
find
not
more
than
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
that
is
a
distinction
i
was
attempting
to
make
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
my
distinction
or
the
distinction
that
i
was
attempting
to
make
was
that
i
recognize
the
fact
that
the
committee
may
obtain
information
through
investigation
by
method
other
than
the
compulsory
process.
and
then
i
would
think
would
be
by
voluntary
acts
upon
the
part
of
a
witness
or
an
association
not
by
any
indirect
act
on
the
part
of
a
spokesman
for
the
committee
which
by
some
other
indirect
source
finds
its
way
to
the
person
to
whom
they
eventually
will
direct
an
inquiry.
that
was
the
distinction
that
i
was
making
that
there
was
a
distinction
there
between
the
compulsory
process
and
the
--
and
the
voluntary
act
of
production.
knowledge
on
his
part
would
necessarily
stem
from
--
in
my
opinion
of
a
--
an
official
act
of
the
committee
to
warrant
this
subjection
to
the
proscriptions
of
the
criminal
statue.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
he
may
and
avoid
criminal
proscription
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
yes.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
do.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
well
i
think
i
--
the
argument
that
i
was
not
making
was
that
only
by
compulsory
process
may
the
committee
obtain
information
through
investigation.
i
was
attempting
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
type
of
investigation
where
they
compel
the
--
the
production
of
documents
or
testimony
of
a
witness
and
the
type
where
they
may
obtain
it
voluntarily.
but
the
voluntary
act
as
i
see
it
would
be
on
the
part
of
the
institution
which
would
produce
the
documents
or
the
witness
that
would
give
the
information.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
think
that
the
as
a
definition
of
the
--
that
would
be
a
good
definition.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
think
that
there's
a
definition
that
that
would
be
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
don't
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
don't
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
--
think
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
no.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
no.
i
don't
know
of
such
a
case.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
not
as
they
pertain
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
--
to
investigation.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
they
have
not
as
it
pertains
to
an
investigation.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
there
is
none
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
hasn't
been
a
subpoena
served
upon
the
petitioner
or
joint
council
41
to
this
day
other
than
the
one
which
is
the
subject
of
this
lawsuit.
because
of
the
imperfection
that
existed
in
which
we
claim
did
exist,
we
are
also
of
the
opinion
that
there
--
if
there
could
not
have
been
from
the
time
that
it
was
served
until
of
the
acts
late
in
the
indictment
were
completed,
a
waiver
of
any
objection
of
procedural
regularity
which
would
in
anyway
void
the
subpoena
in
the
original
instance.
the
--
the
chairman
was
authorized
to
issue
these
subpoenas.
he
took
the
stand
against
the
petitioner
and
was
never
asked
and
did
not
testify
that
he
issued
the
subpoena.
we
think
that
there
is
a
significance
in
the
word
issue
that
for
the
committee
to
properly
be
in
the
exercise
of
its
investigative
powers,
the
substance
of
that
subpoena
along
with
the
authoritative
signature
must
come
from
the
power
which
congress
has
given
the
chairman
alone.
there
was
one
exception
in
that
according
to
the
rules
of
procedure
and
that
was
if
the
chairman
could
if
he
so
decided,
grant
the
power
to
issue
subpoenas
to
another
member
of
the
committee
provided
that
the
execution
of
that
authority
was
in
writing.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
authority
issued
by
the
chairman.
senator
mcclellan
stated
that
the
authority
reposed
in
the
committee
was
in
--
in
the
chair
for
issuing
subpoenas.
therefore,
we
think
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
on
this
issue,
the
invalidity
of
the
pros
--
of
the
--
of
the
subpoena
prevented
the
petitioner
or
anyone
connected
with
the
joint
council
41
in
--
in
authority
to
waive
any
objections
to
the
procedural
requirements
and
due
to
the
court
or
to
the
committee's
own
rules
of
procedure,
the
only
method
in
which
a
delegation
of
the
authority
for
issuing
subpoenas
had
to
be
in
writing
and
not
to
an
investigator.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
that's
--
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
wrote.
their
decision
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
record
substantially
showed
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
and
therefore,
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
holding
that
the
indictment
may
not
be
or
should
not
be
dismissed
because
the
subpoena
was
validly
issued
by
the
committee.
in
that
respect,
i
might
say
that
the
--
the
trial
court
was
not
of
all
sure,
the
record
discloses
--
the
trial
court
said
that
he
wasn't
sure
in
this
case
but
he
thought
that
in
the
--
in
the
federal
investigating
committees,
that
this
type
of
subpoena
had
been
in
use
and
would
be
valid
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
then
specifically
held
that
it
was
properly
issued.
we
believe,
we
submit
to
the
court
as
i
said
that
this
warrant
and
justifies
now
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment
against
the
petitioner.
however,
we
are
not
at
all
resting
exclusively
on
--
on
that
particular
question
although
we
think
that
that
is
a
pervasive
in
--
infection
with
which
affects
the
--
the
complete
case.we
also
believe
that
the
testimony
of
senator
mcclellan
against
the
petitioner
was
prejudicial
to
his
rights
both
as
to
form
and
as
to
fact.
the
senator
testified
that
there
was
some
investigation
made
in
ohio
in
1958
concerning
senator
bender
--
ex-senator
bender
because
the
committee
was
interested
in
whether
or
not
mr.
hoffa
had
fulfill
the
promise
to
clean
up
the
union.
senator
bender
apparently
was
assigned
as
one
of
the
members
of
the
internal
commission
who
want
to
clean
up
of
the
--
the
union.
he
did
not
testify
that
the
documents
under
subpoena
were
at
all
pertinent
to
that
inquiry
of
the
committee.
his
most
specific
statement
was
that
the
committee
was
interested
in
the
use
of
union
funds
for
the
payment
and
purchase
of
christmas
gifts.
the
investigator
himself
testified
that
he
came
into
ohio
to
investigate
the
appointment
of
bender
to
the
cleanup
committee.
senator
mcclellan
then
was
permitted
to
read
what
the
findings
and
the
conclusions
of
the
past
investigations
of
this
committee
had
resulted
in
and
state
why
in
his
opinion
the
names
that
were
listed,
allegedly
listed
on
the
invoice,
were
pertinent
to
the
then
investigation
of
the
committee.
the
substance
of
--
of
the
names
was
an
attempt
to
show
and
display
to
the
jury
the
reputation
which
the
mcclellan
committee
had
concluded,
existed
on
those
men
whose
names
were
listed
in
the
invoice.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
lunch
period,
i
have
mentioned
that
our
second
disagreement
in
this
case
through
the
courts
has
been
with
the
testimony
of
senator
mcclellan.
now,
senator
mcclellan
did
testify
and
his
testimony
date
may
--
maybe
broken
down
into
four
general
categories.
first
--
first
of
which,
he
testified
to
the
resolutions
which
in
the
authorizing
resolutions
and
the
rules
of
procedure
that
were
enacted
pursuant
thereto,
he
testified
concerning
the
investigations
that
the
committee
had
handled
in
the
past
and
the
recommendations
which
they
had
made
with
special
findings
relative
to
certain
individuals.
he
was
then
permitted
to
testify
by
reading
the
testimony
of
investigator
sheridan
before
the
committee
as
a
corroboration
of
sheridan's
testimony
because
sheridan
later
did
testify
to
the
same
things
that
the
senator
read
from
the
committee
record.
i
might
add
at
this
point
that
the
case
was
tried
and
conceived
by
the
prosecutor
and
conceived
by
the
trial
court
as
if
it
were
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
to
lay
a
foundation
to
show
pertinency
before
the
committee
and
that
can
be
seen
by
the
evidence
which
the
trial
court
did
let
in
and
asserted
throughout
the
trial
and
in
overruling
the
objections
to
the
senator's
testimony
and
in
his
charge
that
the
relevancy
or
the
pertinency
of
these
documents
to
the
question
under
inquiry
by
the
committee
was
a
matter
of
fact.
the
evidence
before
categories
of
evidence
that
was
offered
by
senator
mcclellan
substantially
were
exclusively
for
the
proof
of
that
element
viewed
by
the
prosecution
in
the
trial
court
as
questions
of
fact.
this
testimony
was
offered
or
admitted
over
the
objection
of
--
of
the
defendant
and
from
it
the
prosecutor
cross-examined
the
--
the
petitioner
and
made
the
rather
derogatory
remarks
about
members
of
the
teamster's
union
a
part
--
a
large
part
of
this
argument
to
the
jury.
in
addition
to
that,
viewing
the
pertinency
irrelevant
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
yes.
from
the
special
findings
as
they
were
set
forth
in
the
interim
report
so-called
and
the
remarks
of
the
--
that
were
made
by
sheridan
to
the
committee
which
were
then
at
the
trial
read
into
evidence
over
objection.
the
--
the
crowning
thorn
of
--
of
what
we
think
is
the
objectionable
evidence
is
when
the
senator
was
permitted
to
testify
before
the
jury
that
the
documents
which
were
the
subject
of
the
--
of
the
subpoena
and
for
which
the
petitioner
had
been
indicted
were
in
fact
and
in
law
pertinent
to
the
investigation
of
the
committee.
in
this
regard,
we
feel
that
the
--
the
court
treated
the
pertinency
or
relevancy
question
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
in
fact
it
is
a
matter
of
law
if
the
trial
court
were
correct,
the
question
of
facts
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
without
the
conclusions
of
the
--
of
the
senator
upon
that
--
that
element
which
should
have
been
in
his
view
a
matter
of
fact
for
their
--
for
their
determination.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
there
was
a
question
of
law
and
--
there
was
a
general
objection
to
the
taking
of
the
testimony
of
senator
mcclellan
following
his
identification
of
the
resolutions.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
well,
it
was
a
matter
of
law.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
it
said
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
--
that
that
was
brought
home
to
the
trial
judge.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
the
--
the
--
this
came
up
during
objections
to
the
admission
of
senator
mcclellan's
testimony
and
a
colloquy
ensued
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
trial
court
as
to
the
admission
of
senator
mcclellan's
testimony
in
which
the
trial
courts
stated
that
it
was
a
question
of
fact
and
this
was
a
way
that
should
be
handled
to
which
an
objection
was
taken,
i
hasten
to
add.
your
honor,
may
i
save
a
few
minutes
of
my
time.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
there
are
a
few
things
that
i
like
--
would
like
to
correct,
the
--
the
statements
of
the
solicitor
general
on
and
that
is
with
respect
to
these
two
subpoenas
that
he
had
mentioned
or
had
made
some
reference
to.
there
is
only
one
subpoena
involved
in
this
case
and
that's
the
one
that
was
served
on
the
petitioner
in
march.
now,
there
is
a
reference
through
cross-examination
of
sheridan
to
another
one
which
was
signed
in
april.
but
as
to
that
particular
subpoena
when
he
was
asked
if
that
had
been
prepared
(inaudible)
in
cleveland,
he
was
quite
definite.
and
on
page
89
of
the
record,
he
says
that
--
he
said
that
i
say
that
it
was
prepared
in
cleveland
so
that
the
reference
that
we
are
making
some
issue
out
of
a
subpoena
that
was
in
all
respects
or
in
some
respects
invalid
and
is
against
another
which
was
in
the
--
executed
in
the
same
way,
but
which
we
do
not
make
any
issue
to
is
an
incorrect
statement
of
the
record.
i
think
another
thing
that
has
--
has
bothered
me
throughout
this
appeal
is
that
the
government
consistence
upon
referring
to
mr.
presser
as
making
an
alibi.
he
did
take
a
stand.
he
corroborated
sheridan
in
that.
he
testified
that
sheridan
left
his
office
before
he
did
on
september
the
9th.
there
was
some
as
--
some
point
of
differences
to
one
he
returned,
but
he
--
in
any
event,
he
returned
on
september
the
12th
and
sheridan
did
not
return
until
september
the
13th.
so
in
any
event
the
--
on
september
the
9th
and
the
13th,
the
petitioner
was
in
his
office
when
sheridan
was
not.
there
was
never
any
attempt
to
make
an
alibi
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
statement
that
the
matters
were
pertinent
as
a
matter
of
law
and
therefore,
the
petitioner's
failure
to
state
to
the
court
specifically
that
such
matter
should
be
sought
evidence
on
pertinency
should
be
heard
outside
the
jury
cannot
be
sustained
on
the
basis
of
braden
as
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
because
in
the
braden
case
which
was
the
converse,
the
failure
to
object
was
not
taken
as
the
conclusive
factor
for
the
court's
decision
on
that
particular
point.
and
in
this
case,
the
enumerable
objections
cannot
be
taken
as
nullities
because
the
court
did
in
many
cases
recognize
exactly
what
the
objection
was
for.
now
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
yes.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
not
--
not
that
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
mean
to
say
and
i
had
mentioned
before
that
a
request
to
hear
this
testimony
outside
the
jury
is
--
has
not
been
taken
in
the
record.
the
fact
that
the
objection
was
taken
to
the
hearsay
testimony
that
would
be
presented
by
the
--
by
the
senator
was
in
our
minds
an
objection
on
the
ground
that
this
testimony
would
be
self-serving
to
the
extent
that
the
government
was
attempting
to
form
or
provide
a
basis
much
as
they
would
be
for
a
committee
to
show
pertinency.
they
were
laying
the
foundation
for
pertinency
by
bringing
in
this
testimony
and
that
was
the
basis
of
our
objection
that
it
would
be
self-serving
to
that
extent.
but
those
words
are
not
in
the
record.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i'd
say
about
an
hour
and
a
half
or
two
hours.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
total
trial
was
three
or
four
days.
i
don't
know
exactly
--
i
think
it
was
--
there
was
a
weekend
in
between.
i've
forgotten,
but
i
think
it
was
three
or
four
days.
but
the
fact
that
his
testimony
only
took
the
first
morning
was
not
allowed
to
escape
the
jury
because
the
prosecutor
was
permitted
on
cross-examination
of
presser
on
the
final
day
to
go
to
some
length
in
cross-examining
him
as
to
the
findings
of
this
committee,
special
findings
as
--
as
to
dorfman
that
he
had
ascended
to
the
presidency
of
some
union
as
a
result
of
the
murder
of
his
--
his
predecessor.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
i
can
point
--
yes,
it's
at
255
of
the
record.
and
then
it
--
it
continues
and
on
256
of
the
record,
the
prosecutor
says,
“does
it
refresh
your
recollection
that
the
committee
made
the
statement,
etcetera
to
which
there
is
objection?"
and
that
is
continued
through
dorfman,
hoffa,
beck,
english
and
i
don't
know
whether
mr.
brennan
was
in
there
or
not.
and
in
his
argument,
he
was
again
permitted
to
say
that
they
did
not
bring
this
up
to
prejudice
the
mind
of
the
jury
against
the
--
the
petitioner.
they
merely
wanted
to
show
a
motive
but
the
motive
was
manufactured.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
at
256,
that's
presser
--
that
is
the
petitioner.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
yes.
that
is
the
--
oh,
that's
--
that
is
the
--
the
defendant
below
and
the
petitioner
here
and
that
was
the
prosecutor's
cross-examination
of
the
--
the
then
defendant
on
the
basis
of
this
interim
report
finding.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
oh,
i'm
--
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
not
presser's
--
not
presser's
direct
examination,
but
while
mcclellan
was
on
the
stand
and
these
objections
were
being
taken
to
his
testimony,
he
was
permitted
over
objection
to
read
on
page
43
of
the
record,
his
committee's
findings
relative
to
english,
hoffa,
brennan,
bender,
kernel,
bliss
and
dorfman.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
oh
yes.
on
page
40
--
begins
on
page
43.
mr.
john
g.
cardinal
and
it
--
it
begins
on
page
42
where
the
objections
were
taken
and
the
court
originally
sustained
the
defendant's
objection.
the
middle
of
42,
the
court
says,
“objection
sustained.
i
don't'
see
what
materiality
it
has.”
the
prosecutor
then
went
into
this
statement
as
to
why
he
wanted
it.
the
court
not
satisfied
yet
said,
“was
it
a
matter
that
one
official
gave
another
official
a
champagne
bucket?”
at
that
point,
the
senator
recognized
the
problem
and
said
it's
a
question
of
union
--
using
union
dues.
then
the
court
for
some
incongruous
reasons
said
you
may
continue
and
he
then
characterized
these
names.
and
you
will
see
also
at
257
that
the
reason
for
overruling
the
objection,
objection
on
cross-examination
was
because
the
name
was
on
--
one
of
the
names
was
present.
one
--
one
more
thing
before
i
closed,
i
‘d
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
mention
that
bender
was
under
a
personal
subpoena
by
the
government
at
the
time
and
spent
his
time
in
the
hall
of
the
court,
but
was
never
called.
i'd
also
i
like
to
mention
that
on
september
the
9th,
sheridan
had
the
documents
which
are
the
subject
of
this
lawsuit
in
his
hands
and
could
have
taken
them
by
giving
a
receipt
which
was
then
the
custom

practice

the
field
office

council

but
refused.
the
entire
--
the
entire
financial
record

council

pertaining
to
these
gifts
was
in
the
hands
of
the
field
office
on
september
9th
1958.
i
think
of
significance
is
that
the
subpoena
which
the
petitioner
has
been
accused
of
violating
was
issued
six
months
before
the
document
involved
here
was
demanded
and
he
was
not
charged,
not
indicted
till
six
months
following
and
that
the
documents
involved
were
not
--
and
this
is
in
the
record,
were
not
turned
over
to
any
department
other
than
sheridan's
custody
as
appears
until
november
18th
of
1958,
approximately
three
months
later.
