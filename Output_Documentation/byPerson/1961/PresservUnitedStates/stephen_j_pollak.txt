mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
corruptly
obstructing
an
inquiry
of
a
committee
of
congress
with
knowledge
that
documents
were
sought
that
they
were
pertinent
to
the
inquiry,
he
defaced.
he
was
convicted
of
defacing
one
document
in
concealing
or
destroying
another.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
knowing
obstruction
of
this
inquiry
is
excused
because
a
subpoena
for
the
documents
was
signed
in
blank
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee.
as
judge
weinfeld
in
a
similar
case
where
there
was
no
subpoena
stated,
it
is
here
whether
in
effectiveness
of
inquiries
depends
upon
“the
result
in
a
raise”
between
the
marshal
to
serve
process
for
the
production
of
documents
and
those
bent
on
their
destruction
in
their
endeavor
to
obstruct
the
administration
of
justice.”
this
is
the
solo
case
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
solo
case,
it
is
cited
in
a
citation
at
page
24,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
petitioner
also
questions
the
admissibility
of
certain
testimony
by
senator
mcclellan
as
well
as
whether
certain
of
that
testimony
should
have
been
permitted
to
go
before
the
jury.
briefly
certain
facts
are
important.
the
mcclellan
committee
was
established
by
resolution
to
inquire
into
improper
practices
in
the
labor
management
relations
field.
it
was
given
powers
in
accordance
with
statute,
statute
quoted
at
pages
2
and
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
2
u.s.c.
190b
which
includes
the
power
to
require
by
subpoena
or
otherwise
the
attendance
of
witnesses
and
the
production
of
documentary
materials.
the
committee
investigated
the
misuse
of
union
funds
to
influence
public
officials,
to
enrich
union
officials
and
the
domination
of,
the
possible
domination
of
unions
by
persons
outside.
it
issued
in
march
of
1958
a
report
of
finding
with
respect
to
the
teamsters
union.
thereafter
a
subpoena
was
issued
for
the
production
of
documents
to
joint
council
41
of
which
the
petitioner
was
the
president.
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
it
was
developed
that
that
subpoena
was
probably
signed
in
blank
by
senator
mcclellan.
pursuant
to
the
arrangements
between
the
lawyers
for
joint
council
41
and
the
attorneys
for
the
committee,
there
were
several
deliveries
of
documents
pursuant
to
that
subpoena.
that
was
in
the
time
subsequent
to
march
1958.
in
the
late
summer,
while
this
inquiry
was
going
on,
the
late
summer
of
1958,
the
committee
was
informed
by
counsel
for
the
teamsters
union
and
its
provisional
president
that
a
clean
up
commission
had
been
formed
of
which
former
senator
bender
was
the
chairman.
the
committee
turned
its
attention
in
part
as
part
of
its
inquiry
in
relationships
or
the
possibility
of
relationships
between
former
senator
bender
and
the
teamsters
union
and
as
part
of
the
ongoing
inquiry
in
ohio
the
investigators
of
the
committee
were
instructed
to
pursue
an
inquiry
into
a
possible
relationship.
pursuant
to
these
instructions,
the
committee's
investigator,
sheridan,
called
upon
the
offices
of
joint
council
41
to
review
documents,
if
any,
which
should
not
get
and
produce
in
response
to
the
subpoena
issued
six
months
prior
to
that
time.
the
petitioner
was
agreeable
to
the
inspection
of
the
files
in
that
office
and
the
investigator
spent
the
day
reviewing
those
files.
he
found
an
invoice
described
by
petitioner's
counsel
as
the
doich
invoice
showing
gifts
to
champagne
masters,
large
champagne
bucket
in
which
you
put
a
champagne
bottle,
expensive
gifts
to
former
senator
bender
to
another
ohio
political
figure,
to
officers
of
the
union,
and
others.
he
also
found
a
yellow
memorandum
page,
yellow
pad
page,
on
which
names
of
recipients
of
gifts
were
listed,
including
the
recipients
of
the
champagne
masters
as
well
as
other
names.
he
asked
the
petitioner
for
permission
to
take
four
folders
of
documents
included
in
which
were
these
two
papers;
the
invoice
and
the
yellow
memorandum
page.
the
petitioner
stated
that
he
was
agreeable
and
then
said
that
he
wish
to
photostat
the
documents
so
that
he
needed
to
retain
them.
the
investigator
said
that
that
was
agreeable
and
an
agreement
was
made
that
the
documents
would
be
left
and
photostats
would
be
made
and
they
would
be
turned
over
directly
thereafter.
four
days
later,
the
investigator
returned
pursuant
to
telephone
arrangements
with
the
petitioner,
returned
to
the
office
to
pick
up
the
four
file
folders.
upon
the
arrival,
the
petitioner
handed
in
the
file
folders
and
the
investigator
leafed
through
them
and
found
that
the
invoice
had
been
mutilated
to
tear
off
the
bottom
portion
which
listed
the
eight
names
of
recipients
of
the
gifts
of
champagne
masters.
the
yellow
memorandum
page
was
missing
entirely.
the
investigator
called
this
to
the
attention
of
the
petitioner
and
said,
“i
should
have
known
better
than
to
have
trusted
you”
and
the
petitioner's
response
was,
“you
have
your
job
to
do,
i
have
mine.”
petitioner
was
indicted
for
concealment
of
these
documents
under
section
1505
of
title
18
which
makes
it
a
crime
corruptly
to
obstruct
the
due
and
proper
inquiry
of
a
committee
congress.
he
was
charged,
pardon
me,
he
was
charged
with
concealment
well
knowing
that
the
documents
were
sought,
that
they
were
pertinent
to
the
inquiry
and
required
to
be
produced
and
sentenced
upon
conviction
by
a
jury
to
eight
months
confinement.
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
that
section
1505
of
title
18
does
not
require
a
subpoena.
the
elements
of
this
crime
are
four.
first,
that
the
general
subject
matter
--
pardon.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
is
the
government's
position
that
under
the
language
of
this
indictment
which
refers
--
the
indictment
is
set
out
at
pages
5
and
6
and
7
of
the
record
which
describes
the
documents
using
the
words
the
invoice
which
for
a
reasonable
relation
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
and
was
relevant
to
it
and
was
required
to
be
produced
to
the
committee
under
and
accordance
with
a
subpoena.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
do
not
believe
that
the
government
was
required
to
prove
that
the
subpoena
was
valid
under
the
statute
and
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
proof
that
the
subpoena
was
valid,
if
not
made
would
have
been
an
immaterial
variance
from
this
indictment.
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena,
mr.
justice
black,
is
an
extremely
important
thing
and
we
take
this
position
because
we
read
the
statute
to
require
proof
that
there
was
--
that
the
documents
were
sought
proof,
known
that
the
petitioner
knew
the
documents
were
sought,
that
the
petitioner
knew
the
documents
were
relevant,
and
that
the
petitioner
destroyed
them
with
the
corrupt
intent
to
obstruct
the
inquiry.
we
consider
that
this
proof
is
made
and
made
here
without
a
showing
that
the
subpoena
was
a
valid
subpoena.
we
note
that
the
subpoena
here
is
a
subpoena
signed
in
blank
and
that
the
doc
--
that
it
had
been
issued
some
six
months
before
and
there
had
been
arrangements
between
lawyers
for
both
parties
that
the
documents
were
produced.
so
we
don't
wish
to
concede
that
this
was
at
the
time
these
documents
were
concealed
or
mutilated
at
that
time
a
subpoena
which
had
not
been
ratified.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
--
in
this,
the
government
relies
on
section
1505.
now
that's
the
only
statute
on
which
we
place
our
reliance
and
we
--
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
committee
notifies
through
an
official
authorized
investigator
informs
a
party
that
documents
are
sought
for
its
inquiry
and
if
those
documents
are
known
by
the
party
to
be
relevant
and
pertinent
to
the
inquiry,
then
the
party
cannot
destroy
those
documents
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
to
obstruct
the
import.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
would
draw
or
at
least
in
answering
your
question,
i
don't
want
to
preclude
the
possibility
that
a
business
which
has
a
routine
method
of
clearing
out
its
records,
could
not
continue
to
practice
its
routine
practices
for
clearing
records
and
therefore
show
that
it
had
no
intent
to
obstruct
the
committee's
inquiry.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
justice
black,
we
also
make
this
position
clear
that
the
subpoena
here
was
the
subpoena
which
was
signed
in
blank
called
for
production
of
the
documents
in
washington
before
the
committee
and
certainly
we
would
not
mean
to
foreclose
that
the
petitioner
or
any
other
party
that
we
see
such
a
request
could
not
immediately
bring
its
objections
or
complaints
with
respect
to
the
committee's
request
or
its
desire
to
move
these
documents
from
its
shelves
to
the
committee.
this
is
not
a
prosecution
here
for
failure
to
produce
the
documents.
i
certainly
would
not
wish
to
say
that
where
a
subpoena
which
the
respondent
could
show
was
invalid
had
been
served
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
failing
to
produce.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
without
a
subpoena,
a
person
could
be
prosecuted
for
destroying
documents
known
to
be
sought
in
relevant
to
a
congressional
inquiry.
we
certainly
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
cite
to
the
court
in
our
brief
without
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
solo
case,
the
district
court
of
new
york,
judge
weinfeld
was
faced
with
the
destruction
of
four
letters
sought
for
production
before
a
pending
grand
jury.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
telephone
call
from
the
us
attorney
to
the
party
in
which
the
party
stated
that
he
was
agreeable
to
appearing
and
to
producing
the
documents.
thereafter
the
party
was
alleged
and
their
following
convicted
of
destroying
the
four
letters
and
the
court
ruled
that
without
a
subpoena,
he
was
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
1503
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
in
that
case,
he
relied
on
--
he
relied
on
a
primarily
your
honor
on
a
state
case,
commonwealth
versus
southern
express
company.
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
169
southwest
517,
a
case
not
direct
and
recent
case
in
which
there
had
been
removal
of
records
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
a
pending
grand
jury.
and
the
court
held
that
the
removal
of
records
that
were
known
to
be
desired
by
a
pending
grand
jury
was
indictable
at
common
law
and
held
that
the
individual
citizen
may
not
resolve
himself
into
a
court
and
self
determined
what
records
maybe
produced.
there
the
citizen
was
claiming
a
privilege
of
self
incrimination
and
he
removed
the
records
saying
--
making
his
own
determination
that
the
privilege
covered
them.
that
commonwealth
v.
southern
express
was
cited
and
quoted
on
that
point
on
the
removal,
the
record
is
not
--
citizen
not
being
able
to
constitute
himself
a
court
and
remove
records
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
justice
white,
we
believe
that
the
events
that
occurred
in
the
six
months
thereafter,
including
the
agreements
between
counsel,
including
the
knowledge
of
the
ohio
investigation
and
the
creation
of
ohio
field
office
which
in
the
testimony
of
senator
mcclellan
was
brought
home
to
senator
mcclellan
would
constitute
a
ratification
of
this
subpoena.
so
we
rest
really
on
two
positions.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
certainly
this
case
raises
important
questions.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
it
is
our
position
that
there
maybe
cases
considerably
closer
to
our
line
than
the
present
case.
we
think
that
in
this
case,
the
knowledge
that
the
committee
--
documents
were
sought
is
brought
home
to
this
petitioner
without
doubt.
the
knowledge
that
the
documents
were
pertinent
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
documents
are
also
known
to
be
pertinent
and
where
he
destroys
them
to
obstruct
the
inquiry,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
reserving
the
contention
that
the
subpoena
here
had
been
ratified,
we
also
would
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
also
would
take
the
position
that
this
conduct
is
made
criminal
without
a
subpoena.
yes
mr.
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
certainly
would
say
that
that
was
made
criminal
by
the
witness
provisions
of
1505,
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
he
has
not
been
subpoenaed.
where
there
is
knowledge
that
the
person
was
or
is
intended
to
be
a
witness
although
a
subpoena
has
not
issued,
we
would
say
that
is
also
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
closest
case
that
we
have
on
this
is
the
samples
case
which
in
vowed
a
co-defendant
who
is
under
bond.
that
case
is
also
cited
in
our
brief
wherein
the
--
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
page
23.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
--
that
case,
the
co-defendant,
was
under
bond
had
his
privilege
against
self
incrimination
and
he
was
therefore
could
not
be
said
that
he
was
certain
to
be
a
witness
and
he
was
--
but
not
subpoenaed.
and
he
was
convinced
by
the
defendant
in
the
samples
case
to
go
outside
the
jurisdiction.
also,
we
read
the
walker
case
as
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
well
i
--
i
want
to
be
clear
the
state
with
the
facts
on.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
believe
that
the
walker
case
is
also
a
case
where
the
--
that
was
again
a
co-defendant
and
to
my
knowledge
that
case
does
not
involve
the
bond.
walker
was
--
the
court
stated
it
was
not
necessary
to
prove
that
the
witness
had
been
subpoenaed.
she
was
a
witness,
if
she
intended
to
testify
at
the
trial
and
i
don't
read
the
cases
saying
that
the
witness
or
the
co-defendant
had
been
subpoenaed
or
there's
no
indication
that
that
witness
was
under
bond.
where
there
is
knowledge
that
the
person
intends
to
be
or
was
--
intends
to
be
a
witness,
then
section
1503
of
the
courts
and
section
1505
for
administrative
agencies,
executive
departments,
and
the
congressional
committees
would
cover
people.
certainly,
there
is
--
even
in
the
old
sinclair
case
i
believe
a
statement
that
is
not
necessary
that
the
person
be
under
subpoena.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
don't
--
i
think
that
it
stopped
there,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
do
not
know.
no.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
i
do
not
know
that
it
went
to
any
higher
court,
it's
a
district
court
case
and
solely
a
district
court
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
don't
think
to
hide
from
the
subpoena
server
if
he's
out
for
you;
i
don't
think
that
i
have
the
problem
because
where
a
witness
is
concerned,
the
person
--
the
witness
retained
the
possibility
or
the
potentiality
of
giving
the
testimony.
i'd
certainly
say
it's
our
position
that
it's
a
crime
to
hide
from
the
process
server
and
then
take
the
time
and
go
destroy
your
documents
where
the
process
seeks
the
production
of
documents.
the
situation
that
we
have
is
that
the
documents
are
destroyed.
they're
no
longer
possible
to
be
brought
into
the
forum,
the
judicial
forum,
the
committee
forum
and
the
person
has
taken
the
law
into
his
own
hands
to
make
them
no
longer
available.
we're
not
saying
that
the
objections
and
complaints
which
the
person
wishes
to
raise
and
the
committee's
interest
in
the
documents
to
its
right
to
the
documents
cannot
have
full
process
before
the
committee.
here
the
petitioner
chose
to
act
in
the
time
he
bought
by
making
an
agreement
with
the
investigator
and
to
produce
the
documents
after
photostat
and
the
time
that
he
bought
and
destroyed
it
and
by
doing
that,
he
brought
himself
within
this
statute.
we
think
properly.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
in
this,
i
cite
two
cases
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
we
have
the
rule
of
the
--
of
this
--
the
rule
of
procedure
of
this
committee
which
said
that
the
subpoenas
to
be
signed
by
the
chairman
be
issued
by
the
chairman
or
a
member.
therefore,
while
we
don't
wish
to
take
our
position
as
to
the
reach
of
possible
laws
enacted
by
congress
whether
the
subpoena
could
be
signed
by
or
signed
by
mcclellan
and
then
as
subpoenas
under
rule
45
filled
out
by
an
authorized
person
of
the
committee,
i
think
that
probably
would
be
a
valid
process.
but
here,
whether
it
was
a
rule
of
this
committee
why
then
we
look
either
the
ratification
or
the
fact
that
the
statute
does
not
require
a
subpoena.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
as
i
understand
the
rules
that
permit
subpoenas
for
the
production
of
documents
in
civil
proceedings
which
are
signed
by
clerk
and
then
filled
in
by
the
attorney
for
one
of
the
hardest,
in
other
words
the
documents
to
be
produced.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
it
is
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
this
is
not
a
situation
where
there
is
a
general
warrant
and
the
person
does
not
have
a
forum
in
which
to
make
the
objection.
he
did
not
need
to
let
the
investigator
in
or
turn
over
any
documents.
he
could
have
gone
before
the
committee
to
make
this
complaint.
here
this
was
just
the
destruction
of
the
documents.
i
wanted
to
call
two
more
attentions
--
cases
to
your
attention,
mr.
justice
black,
the
bosselman
case,
the
second
circuit
case
involving
destruction
of
documents
and
all
the
relational
documents
sought
by
a
grand
jury.
it
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
i
believe
in
that
case
too,
the
documents
were
interfered
with
prior
to
the
sitting
even
of
the
grand
jury.
although
it's
a
very
brief
report
of
the
case
and
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
it's
dispositve.
the
petitioner's
second
question
concerning
the
admissibility
of
certain
of
the
testimony
of
senator
mcclellan
as
well
as
whether
that
testimony
should
have
been
heard
before
the
jury;
on
this
the
short
answer
in
the
view
of
the
government
is
that
this
testimony
as
can
be
demonstrated
quite
clearly
from
the
review
of
it
and
it's
covered
in
the
government's
brief
subsequent
to
page
36.
this
testimony
was
relevant
and
admissible
on
jury
issues
other
than
the
issue
of
pertinence.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
case
mr.
justice
brennan
was
tried
on
the
understanding
and
upon
an
early
ruling
of
the
court
which
we
read
to
confirm
the
court's
view
that
the
issue
of
pertinency
was
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
tried
to
the
jury.
this
meant
that
the
government's
burden
was
to
show
that
these
documents,
including
names
of
recipients
of
$100
gifts
were
pertinent
to
the
inquiry
of
the
committee.
now
the
course
of
the
investigation
of
the
committee
can
be
shown
to
--
can
be
introduced
in
proof
to
show
what
the
committee's
inquiry
hears,
what
is
the
subject
matter
of
its
inquiry.
this
subject
matter
was
the
misuse
of
union
funds
to
influence
public
officials,
to
enrich
union
officials
or
to
--
or
the
influence
of
unions
by
persons
outside.
now
in
identifying
who
one
of
the
recipients
not
only
mr.
dorfman
but
the
others,
identifying
those
persons
we
believed
it
was
necessary
to
show
that
these
documents
were
pertinent
to
the
committee's
investigation.
the
committee
had
a
legitimate
right
to
be
interested
in
this
investigation
in
documents
showing
a
gift
to
particular
individuals
one
who
was
the
head
of
the
clean
up
committee
or
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
this
report
did
not
go
to
the
jury
and
it
was
early
in
the
trial
admitted
into
evidence
and
then
withdrawn.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
it
was
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
the
report
was
of
some
pages
and
i
think
the
statement
was
made
that
the
reading
of
important
points
in
the
report
would
save
time.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
the
--
i
think
i
really
didn't
complete
my
answer
to
your
question.
the
names
and
identification
of
the
persons
to
whom
these
gifts
were
given
also
was
important
to
show
that
these
documents
contained
information
which
the
petitioner
would
have
a
motive
for
keeping
from
the
committee.
i
think
it
also
is
important
that
the
government
had
the
burden
to
show
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
that
these
documents
were
sought
by
the
committee
and
were
pertinent
to
its
inquiry.
now
this
report
from
which
that
statement
was
read
also
mentioned
by
name,
mr.
presser,
and
i
think
it
was
part
of
the
government's
case
or
it
was
able
to
present
to
the
jury
that
report
as
providing
an
inference
that
the
report's
contents
came
to
the
potential
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
court's
charge
and
the
statement
of
the
prosecution
in
the
record
show
a
careful
attention
to
that
and
i
think
it's
important
that
every
instruction
requested
by
the
petitioner
was
given
by
the
court
and
that
he
was
asked
twice
whether
he
had
objections
in
accordance
with
rule
30.
he
was
asked
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
his
lawyer,
and
after
the
jury
was
excused
whether
there
were
any
objections
to
the
charge,
and
he
had
none.
he
received
every
instruction
that
he
had
a
--
that
he
wished
to
request.
none
were
denied,
although
several
of
the
government's
instructions
were.
so
i
do
believe
that
the
jury
was
fairly
portioned
on
the
use
of
the
evidence.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
you're
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
i
believe
that
there
was
a
submission
to
the
jury
of
the
testimony
from
the
report.
it's
just
that
the
court
said
that
the
full
report
did
not
need
to
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
i
can't
review
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
that
--
had
the
question
not
been
answered
--
asked
that
the
government's
case
would
have
been
as
well
presented
because
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
believe
that
in
these
proceedings,
the
counsel
or
not
uncommon
for
the
chairman
of
these
committees
to
have
been
called
as
witnesses
by
the
government
or
the
defense
and
i
believe
further
that
i
can't
testify
from
the
records
in
those
cases
but
that
the
course
of
the
proceedings
are
testified
too
and
that
a
question
whether
the
loss
of
these
documents
was
an
impedance
of
the
committee's
work
is
a
proper
--
is
a
proper
question
for
the
chairman
of
the
committee
to
respond
to
it.
also,
the
statute
here
covers
endeavor
to
obstruct
and
i
do
not
believe
that
the
answer
to
the
question
really
caused
any
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
but
this
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
during
the
course
of
senator
mcclellan's
testimony,
there
were
general
objections
to
perhaps
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
there
were
general
objections
throughout
and
i
was
going
to
say
i
believe
that
probably
have
been
objective
to
it,
yes.
i
do
believe
that
the
evidence
given
to
the
answer
was
merely
cumulative
to
what
was
a
matter
which
even
this
court
could
determine
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
these
documents
were
pertinent
to
the
inquiry
of
the
committee.
if
pertinent,
then
their
destruction
was
an
impedance
to
the
committee
or
government
attempt
to
impede.
