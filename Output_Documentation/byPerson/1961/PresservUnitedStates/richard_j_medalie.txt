mr.
richard
j.
medalie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
the
basic
questions
in
this
case
concerned
the
validity
of
the
subpoena
and
the
admissibility
of
senator
mcclellan's
testimony
but
there
is
a
threshold
question
as
to
whether
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
support
the
conviction
evidence
be
going
to
knowledge,
evidence
going
to
the
obstruction
itself.
and
perhaps
for
the
first
few
minutes
of
my
argument
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
discuss
the
particular
elements
of
this
crime
of
obstructing
congressional
committee
and
sketch
out
some
of
the
bake
--
back
--
basic
background
facts
concerning
the
nature
of
the
investigation
and
the
documents
involved.
now,
the
crime
of
obstructing
or
endeavoring
to
obstruct
a
congressional
committee
as
the
government
sees
it
consists
of
four
elements
at
least
as
it
concerns
this
case.
the
first
one
is
that
there
must
be
a
duly
authorized
investigation.
secondly,
that
the
documents
or
records,
the
information
which
the
committee
is
seeking
must
be
pertinent
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry.
thirdly,
the
defendant
must
have
committed
acts
with
respect
to
those
documents
which
in
fact
constitutes
an
--
constitute
an
obstruction
or
an
endeavor
to
obstruct.
and
ultimately,
he
must
also
be
shown
to
have
a
specific
guilty
knowledge,
a
specific
intent
to
obstruct
the
inquiry.
and
it
was
the
government's
contention
that
all
of
these
elements
were
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
at
the
trial
below.
now,
it's
clear
that
the
congressional
inquiry
investigation
was
properly
authorized
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
impede
the
due
and
proper
administration
of
law
under
--
oh
i'm
sorry,
down
here,
the
due
and
proper
exercise
of
the
power
of
inquiry
under
which
such
inquiry
to
being
had
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i
think
it
must
indicate
that
there
was
an
inquiry
and
pursuant
to
the
resolution,
this
inquiry
was
being
carried
out
in
a
orderly
way
of
--
if
your
question
relates
to
the
subpoena
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it
just
relates
to
the
inquiry.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
this
is
--
this
is
a
difficult
problem
because,
there
is
an
--
a
confusion
here
perhaps
between
this
statute
and
the
content
of
congress
statute
and
the
--
and
indeed
even
the
perjury
statute
as
far
as
materiality.
i
am
not
sure
whether
pertinency
of
the
inquiry
or
pertinency
of
the
documents
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
is
an
essential
element.
for
example,
perhaps
all
that's
necessary
is
to
show
that
there
--
the
committee
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
documents
were
--
were
pertinent
or
that
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
inquiry
without
more,
it
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
that's
right
and
the
government
at
trial
accepted
the
burden
whether
or
not
it
has
in
fact
--
whether
or
not
that
burden
does
exist
in
fact.
it
accepted
and
burdened
the
requirement
to
show
that
the
--
the
specific
inquiries
which
was
carried
on
were
reasonably
related,
were
indeed
pertinent
to
the
authorizing
resolution
of
the
congress
that
what
it
was
doing
was
pursuant
to
its
lawful
powers
and
indeed
that
the
documents
which
were
sought
were
in
fact
pertinent
to
the
subject
matter
of
any
of
the
inquiry.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i
believe
it's
a
question
of
law.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it
is
for
the
judge
and
we
have
not
--
we
have
not
contested
for
example
the
--
this
holding
--
the
holding
of
this
court
in
sinclair
or
its
reaffirmation
in
braden
that
pertinency
in
--
in
its
total
scope
is
a
question
of
law
for
the
judge
to
decide.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh,
well,
certain
aspects
of
it
were.
maybe
it
would
help
if
i
pointed
out
in
the
charge.
at
page
294,
the
judge
does
say,
“the
congress
is
within
its
powers
and
was
within
its
powers
and
function
to
conduct
inquiries
and
investigate
into
the
subjects
upon
which
this
is
power
by
the
constitution
to
legislate
and
it
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
its
powers
and
conducting
an
inquiry
in
respect
of
unlawful
activities
in
labor,
management
relations.”
then
it
does
go
on,
however,
and
say
that
inquiries
are
required
to
have
reasonable
relation
to
the
subject
and
so
on.
then,
on
page
302
--
i'm
sorry
3
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
i'm
just
re
--
indicating
that.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
on
page
303
and
304
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
--
it
then
comes
and
says
in
addition
to
proving
that
the
defendant
he
faced
etcetera
has
required
that
the
government
prove
that
the
records
and
so
on
were
relevant
to
the
inquiry
of
the
committee.
and
then
on
304,
the
court
says
to
the
judge
--
it
says
to
the
jury,
it
will
be
for
you
to
say
from
the
evidence
of
the
subject
whether
the
sending
of
the
gifts
by
the
joint
council
41
to
public
officials
and
so
on
was
a
type
of
practice
relevant
to
the
inquiry
investigation
and
whether
defendant
with
knowledge
and
purpose
of
the
relevant
and
--
of
the
committee
in
the
relevancy
of
the
names,
of
the
recipients'
gifts
and
so
on,
withheld
the
names
from
the
christmas
list.
so,
in
fact
--
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
question
of
pertinency
is
for
the
judge
to
determine
as
a
matter
of
law
according
to
sinclair
and
braden.
in
the
present
case,
at
least
part
of
the
question
of
pertinency
and
i
must
admit
that
the
major
part,
the
relationship
of
the
documents
to
the
specific
entry
was
submitted
to
the
jury
as
a
question
of
fact.
and
perhaps,
even
though
we're
out
of
order
in
argument,
i
--
first
we
should
clear
this
up
because
this
involves
two
--
two
questions
really.
first
of
all,
the
question
in
regard
to
senator
mcclellan's
testimony
as
related
to
the
issue
of
pertinency
whether
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
judge
in
the
absence
of
objection
to
allow
the
jury
to
hear
the
question
of
pertinency
or
in
all
the
testimony
which
went
to
pertinency.
and
then
you
have
a
second
question
namely
even
if
it
is
not
--
or
even
if
it
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
judge
to
allow
the
jury
to
hear
it,
is
it
also
within
the
discretion
of
the
judge
to
submit
that
this
question
of
pertinency
to
the
jury
in
the
absence
of
objection.
and
perhaps,
i
should
turn
to
that
now
because
it
probably
is
concerning
you
and
let's
try
and
--
a
couple
of
this
problem.
the
question
of
--
first
of
all
as
i
mentioned,
it
is
a
matter
of
law
to
be
determined.
but
while
senator
mcclellan
was
testifying,
and
indeed
throughout
the
whole
trial
although
there
were
specific
and
general
objections
to
various
portions
of
this
testimony,
there
was
no
objection
to
his
presenting
any
evidence
as
to
pertinency
to
the
jury
as
such.
you
can
look
through
the
record
in
vain
for
these
objections.
and
we
take
the
position
that
in
the
absence
of
the
objection
there,
the
petitioner
cannot
--
should
not
be
able
to
raise
the
objection
here
before
the
court
and
indeed
considering
the
braden
case,
which
of
course
was
precisely
the
reverse
situation
in
which
the
petitioner
said,
“it
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury
rather
than
the
judge.”
this
court
did
point
out
in
the
opinion
mr.
justice
stewart
that
he
did
not
raise
an
objection.
but
to
be
sure,
he
went
on
to
say
that
even
so
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
was
handled
correctly.
in
addition,
however,
and
this
--
we
now
come
to
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
statute
namely
that
pertinency
isn't
by
--
specific
words
in
--
injected
into
the
statute
and
isn't
in
fact
--
and
related
obstruction
of
justice
statutes
when
you
--
a
statute
when
you're
dealing
with
impeding
a
witness,
the
concept
of
pertinency
has
no
place.
i
mean
you
have
to
make
sure
of
is
that
the
--
the
person
is
to
be
a
witness
in
one
way.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
i
--
i
would
agree
with
you
or
at
least
the
government
at
trial
undertook
this
burden
and
i
certainly
will
not
contest
it
here.
but
peculiarly
enough,
in
this
situation,
the
testimony
or
the
issues
as
to
pertinency
are
--
seemed
to
be
so
inextricably
interrelated
with
the
question
of
knowledge
of
the
petitioner,
the
motive
of
the
petitioner,
indeed
obstruction
itself
that
under
these
circumstances,
we
believe
that
it
was
not
outside
the
discretion
of
the
justice
submitted,
especially
when
you
do
turn
for
example
to
the
exact
testimony
of
senator
mcclellan
because
virtually,
every
word,
every
sentence
of
his
testimony,
not
only
went
to
pertinency.
it
went
to
knowledge.
it
went
to
motive.
i
think
it
would
have
been
rather
difficult
situation
for
the
judge
to
say
right
here,
you
must
stop
senator
mcclellan
and
we'll
hear
that
testimony
outside
the
--
and
dismiss
the
jury.
now,
the
next
sentence
we
will
bring
the
jury
in,
especially
i
should
think
in
a
situation
such
as
we
have
here
where
the
judge
under
proper
admin
--
admonition
to
the
jury
with
careful
explanation
to
the
jury
as
to
precisely
the
limited
purpose
for
which
the
senator's
testimony
as
to
pertinency
was
being
presented
to
the
jury.
i
think
it
was
within
his
broad
discretion
in
the
absence
of
objection
to
allow
the
jury
to
hear
this
testimony.
and
i
--
just
for
--
perhaps
the
court
will
be
interested,
cite
to
you
pages
--
during
the
testimony
itself,
pages
31
and
32,
35
and
36,
42
and
43
where
this
--
you
have
this
constant
admonition.
indeed
and
the
judges
charged
to
the
jury
when
he
dealt
with
senator
mcclellan's
testimony,
when
he
dealt
with
the
issue
of
pertinency,
he
specifically
told
them
that
this
particular
testimony
relating
to
this
subject
was
allowed
and
not
for
purposes
of
--
for
example
corroboration,
but
it
was
allowed
in
purposes
only
as
related
to
pertinency
and
knowledge.
the
prosecutor
went
out
of
his
way
to
tell
the
jury.
don't
confuse
the
issue
of
--
for
example,
page
344
is
an
excellent
example
on
what
this
really
meant.
he
said
now,
the
purpose
for
bringing
out
whether
or
not
beck,
hoffa,
brennan
or
dorfman
or
anyone
else
had
a
bad
reputation.
isn't
that
so
that
it
will
reflect
in
anyway
on
the
defendant
or
it
shouldn't.
the
reason
as
he
goes
on
to
show
is
that
it
would
have
a
direct
relationship
to
motive
and
as
it
had
a
relationship
to
pertinency
itself.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
this
was
in
the
argument
to
the
jury
but
in
the
--
oh
well,
let
me
show
you
the
offer
of
proof
then.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
no,
it
wasn't
the
argument
to
the
jury.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
in
the
offer
of
proof
at
pages
31
and
32,
35,
36,
42,
and
43.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
perhaps
there
was
a
little
confusion
here
because
of
a
certain
problem
of
--
at
page
335,
when
he
discussed
mr.
sheridan's
testimony,
he
says,
“the
purpose
again
of
reading
the
testimony
was
not
only
to
corroborate
mr.
sheridan's
specific
testimony.
it
was
to
show
the
senate
was
interested
in
these
two
documents
and
so
on."
i
should
point
out
that
this
was
a
mistake
by
the
--
of
court
reporter
at
page
386
of
the
record.
the
court
reporter
in
a
special
--
in
a
special
deposition
in
which
both
sides
ask
questions
stated
that
beginning
at
line
21
of
the
record
as
the
transcription
reads,
the
purpose
again
in
reading
the
testimony
was
not
only
to
corroborate
mr.
sheridan's
specific
testimony.
it
should
read
the
purpose
again
and
this
is
the
prosecutor
saying,
“reading
that
testimony
was
not
in
any
way
to
corroborate
mr.
sheridan's
specific
testimony.
it
was
going
to
the
question
of
pertinency
and
that
alone.”
so,
here
we
have
as
i
say
careful
explanation,
careful
admonition
to
the
jury
and
in
the
situation
in
the
absence
of
objection
where
these
issues
are
inextricably
interrelated.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
outside
the
discretion
of
the
judge
to
allow
the
jury
to
hear
it.
now,
we
do
come
to
the
second
problem
namely
whether
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
judge
to
allow
the
jury
to
have
decided
the
question
of
pertinency
because
indeed
that
is
precisely
what
the
judge
did.
again,
interestingly
enough,
absolutely
no
objection
by
the
other
side.
indeed
--
now,
there
came
time
--
and
i
refer
to
pages
386
and
387
of
the
record.
there
came
a
time
when
both
sides
presented
requests
to
the
court
and
the
government
requested
the
court
to
decide
as
a
matter
of
law
that
these
documents
were
pertinent
to
the
inquiry.
and
the
petitioner
did
not
request
that
he
decide
the
documents
were
not
pertinent.
indeed,
petitioner
made
no
statement
whatsoever
as
to
how
the
issue
of
pertinency
should
be
decided
whether
by
judge
or
by
jury.
and
indeed,
at
page
386
when
the
judge
finally
decides
the
question
--
finally
decides
which
request
to
grant
and
which
request
not
to.
he
decides
that
he's
going
to
submit
the
issue
of
pertinency
to
the
court
--
i
mean
to
the
jury.
and
again,
no
objection,
no
exception
by
the
petitioner
and
all
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes
it
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
had
--
as
this
indicated,
they
had
a
--
a
conference
in
which
they
discussed
it
at
length.
i
take
it
at
least
the
indication
is
from
the
record
about
the
request
and
they
were
fully
aware
of
what
request
were
being
granted
or
rejected,
no
objection
by
the
petitioner
or
whatsoever.
and
finally,
after
the
charge
was
made,
the
charge
in
which
the
issue
of
pertinency
was
submitted
to
the
jury
at
page
307
of
the
record,
you
can
see
and
again,
i
think
it
maybe
well
to
even
quote
it
here,
“that
is
all”,
says
the
judge,
"i
intended
to
say
to
the
jury,
are
there
any
matters
you
feel
i
may
have
inadvertently
misstated."
mr.
kiernan,
that's
the
government
counsel,
"nothing
your
honor."
and
mr.
knachel,
"i
have
no
suggestions
your
honor."
and
then
down
below,
counsel
was
--
were
requested
whether
they
wish
to
take
exceptions
to
the
charge
and
mr.
knachel
again
said,
“the
defense
has
nothing
your
honor.
no
exception,
no
objection,
whatsoever.”
so
here
again,
it
is
not
--
not
only
should
petitioner
not
be
allowed
to
present
this
objection
now
before
the
court.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
throughout
the
record
itself,
there
is
an
indication
of
a
calculated
trial
tactic
of
having
this
particular
issue
of
pertinency,
it
precisely
presented
to
the
jury.
and
why
is
that?
because
petitioner
obviously
knew
or
could
surmise
that
the
judge
would
never
have
held
that
these
documents
were
not
pertinent
to
the
inquiry.
and
so
what
did
he
have
to
lose?
indeed,
he
had
everything
to
gain
by
allowing
the
jury.
he
could
hope
to
capitalize
on
whatever
confusion
this
would've
presented.
in
fact,
this
court
in
johnson
versus
united
states,
318
u.s.
stated,
“we
cannot
permit
an
accused
to
elect
--
to
pursue
one
course
at
the
trial
and
then
when
that
has
proved
to
be
unprofitable
to
insist
on
appeal
that
the
course
which
he
rejected
at
the
trial
be
reopened
to
him.”
and
indeed,
we
go
further
and
say
that
there
could
not
have
been
any
prejudice
by
having
this
issue
submitted
because
as
i
will
now
indicate,
these
documents
were
in
fact
pertinent
to
this
nature,
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
as
a
matter
of
law,
no
judge
--
no
judge,
a
reasonable
judge
could
possibly
find
that
they
were
not.
and
as
a
result,
what
actually
happened
was
that
the
government
had
one
more
obstacle
to
overcome
in
order
to
convince
the
jury
that
petitioner
presser
had
obstructed
the
lawful
inquiry
of
the
committee.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
as
to
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh,
whether
it
should
be
presented
to
the
jury
--
i
take
it,
it
was
raised
when
the
government
submitted
its
request
to
the
judge
that
he
decide
the
issue
as
a
matter
of
law.
now
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh!
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
i
think
it
was
on
judge
--
he
may
have
raised
it
on
the
motion
for
n.o.v.
and
if
not
--
if
not,
then
at
the
court
of
appeals'
level.
and
mind
you,
if
one
reads
the
briefs
and
especially
the
reply
brief
of
petitioner,
this
issue
of
presenting
the
issue
of
pertinency
to
the
jury
is
not
really
prop
--
it's
not
even
a
question
before
this
court
properly
speaking
and
it
was
not
raised,
question
as
one
on
certiorari.
it
is
brought
in
within
the
context
of
whether
--
in
the
whole
context
of
whether
that
senator
mcclellan's
testimony
was
admissible
and
then
he
goes
into
the
discussion
of
pertinency
and
goes
into
the
question
whether
pertinency
should've
been
submitted
to
the
trial.
now,
we
don't
of
course
base
our
argument
on
that,
whether
it
was
or
was
not
raised
before
this
court
as
proper
question
in
certiorari.
but
it
--
it's
interesting
that
it
is
almost
a
--
an
afterthought
or
it's
riding
on
an
objection
which
petitioner
seems
to
indicate
is
more
important
whether
the
mcclellan's
testimony
was
admissible
at
all.
therefore,
in
the
absence
of
objection
especially
under
the
circumstances
of
this
--
of
the
relationship
of
pertinency
to
knowledge
and
so
on,
i
do
not
think
that
one
could
really
say
it
was
an
error
for
the
judge
to
have
exercised
his
broad
discretion
in
allowing
the
jury
to
decide
this
issue
especially
in
the
absence
of
objection
from
petitioner.
and
i
suppose
we
do
come
to
this
question,
although
the
government
doesn't
consider
it
a
serious
question,
whether
indeed
the
documents
were
pertinent
to
the
inquiry.
i
think
perhaps
it
might
help
to
under
--
to
know
what
was
the
scope
of
mcclellan
investigation
as
i
--
first
of
all,
mcclellan
committee
had
been
set
up
under
resolution
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
criminal
and
other
improper
practices
in
labor
management
relations
and
to
see
whether
there
were
any
changes
that
had
to
be
that
our
laws
had
to
be
changed
in
any
way.
and
as
we
all
know,
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosing
act
was
passed
in
due
course.
now,
as
an
integral
part
of
this
investigation,
the
mcclellan
committee
undertook
an
inquiry
into
the
question
of
misappropriation
and
misuse
of
the
union
funds,
both
operating
funds
and
welfare
funds
in
order
to
enrich
union
officials
or
to
influence
political
and
public
figures.
and
it
also
inquired
into
the
possible
domination
of
various
unions
by
people
outside
the
labor
movement.
now,
among
the
union's
investigator
was
the
teamsters
union
and
among
those
specific
inquiries
which
undertook
with
regard
to
the
teamsters
and
which
is
specifically
relevant
here
was
the
relationship
of
teamsters
union
officials
to
racketeers
or
reputed
racketeers.
and
secondly
the
relationship
present
and
past
between
the
teamsters
union
and
former
senator
george
bender
who
was
set
up
as
the
head
of
the
so-called
clean
up
or
anti-racketeering
committee
which
the
teamsters
union
had
set
up
in
order
to
investigate
purportedly
the
corruption
and
improper
practices
of
its
own
officials.
what
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
he
was
a
sen
--
i
believed
1954,
he
was
a
senator
still
at
--
in
1955,
1956
i
believe
he
--
he
was
probably
defeated.
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
he
was
a
senator.
the
--
the
date
of
the
champagne
bucket
gifts
was
1955.
and
he
was
a
senator
at
that
time
and
i
should
perhaps
add
that
he
was
in
charged
of
a
--
an
investigation
into
teamster
activities
among
other
things
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
on
behalf
of
the
senate
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes
--
yes,
well
--
perhaps
i
should
clarify
this.
in
1955,
when
the
gifts
of
champagne
buckets
were
given
to
the
various
people
involved
beck,
hoffa,
bender,
dorfman,
etcetera.
he
was
a
senator
at
the
time.
he
was
appointed
in
august
of
1958
and
mind
you
this
in
--
the
incident
which
we
charged
was
the
obstruction
of
congress
occurred
in
september
9th,
somewhere
between
september
9th
and
september
13th,
1958.
in
august
of
1958
as
i
understand
it,
senator
bender,
former
senator
--
now,
former
senator
bender
was
appointed
as
head
of
this
clean
up
committee
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
no,
he
was
not
a
senator
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
he
was
defeated
in
1956
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
he
had
received
the
gift,
the
champagne
bucket
or
at
least
the
invoice
indicates
that
the
champagne
bucket
had
been
purchased
for
senator
bender
in
1955.
in
1958,
he
was
appointed
there
as
the
head
of
the
committee
and
as
a
result
--
oh,
and
as
in
--
hoffa
himself,
jimmy
hoffa
himself
had
set
up
this
committee,
this
clean
up
and
anti-racketeering
committee
and
appointed
senator
bender
as
the
--
the
head
of
the
committee.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
might
point
out
that
in
hearings
in
1959,
july
1959
before
the
select
committee
which
is
the
hearings
of
the
86
--
86th
congress
first
session.
this
is
part
55
with
the
hearings
at
page
19420
senator
bender
testifies
as
to
his
relationship
and
as
to
his
--
well,
the
results
of
the
bender
com
--
of
bender
committee.
i
should
point
out
i
believe
that
according
to
press
reports
in
december
of
1958,
mr.
hoffa
reported
to
his
constituency,
the
union
that
as
a
result
of
preliminary
studies
by
the
bender
committee,
bender
had
found
or
the
committee
had
found,
the
commission
had
found
that
there
was
no
information
as
to
the
possible
influx
of
racketeers
or
the
possible
corruption
of
local
officials.
but
bender
continued,
however,
during
that
period
of
time
and
as
late
as
july
1959,
he
was
still
head
of
this
commission,
the
time.
and
--
and
this
information
was
brought
up
in
the
hearing
but
be
that
as
it
may
these
two
was
--
was
the
subject
of
the
inquiry.
and
we
now
come
of
course
to
whether
these
documents
were
pertinent
to
the
inquiry.
i'm
not
sure
that
one
even
has
to
go
to
discuss
it
because
the
documents
consisted
of
the
mutilated
invoice,
the
concealed
and
withheld
enveloped
saying
christmas
gift
on
it
and
the
memorandum
with
the
names
which
had
recently
been
on
the
invoice
in
addition
to
other
names
plus
notation
of
gift
or
money
and
so
on.
in
other
words,
the
invoice
itself
had
shown
that
union
funds,
i
suppose
a
(inaudible)
from
the
union
members
were
being
used
to
buy
expensive
christmas
gifts
for
union
leaders
that
is,
beck,
hoffa
and
brennan
for
political
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no
relation
mr.
justice.
for
political
leaders
of
former
senator
george
--
well,
at
that
time,
senator
george
bender
but
now
former
or
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
former
senator
and
chairman
of
the
republican
party
in
ohio,
mr.
bliss,
and
finally
mr.
paul
dorfman
who
had
been
--
who
had
been
identified
by
senator
mcclellan
as
a
--
generally
a
person
of
(inaudible).
now
mind
you,
none
of
these
identifications
went
to
the
truth
or
went
to
the
--
the
facts
of
whether
or
not
these
people
were
--
had
bad
reputation
and
that
wasn't
the
point
of
the
testimony.
the
point
of
the
testimony
was
that
since
the
committee
was
interested
in
the
relationship
of
the
union
to
the
--
to
reputed
racketeers
or
people
of
bad
repute
since
they
were
concerned
with
the
misuse
of
union
funds
for
political
leaders,
for
union
officials,
since
they
were
really
concerned
with
the
relationship
of
senator
bender.
clearly,
this
information
was
pertinent
because
from
this
information
they
could
have
at
least
begun
other
inquiries.
it
indicated
that
as
early
as
1955,
if
not
earlier,
the
union
was
giving
expensive
gift,
christmas
gifts,
$100
champagne
buckets
to
these
people
among
others.
now,
whether
or
not
this
was
improper
that
too
was
not
a
question.
that's
in
this
case.
it
may
very
well
have
been
proper.
maybe
there
was
a
reasonable
explanation
for
giving
these
gifts
just
as
one
gives
a
gift
to
a
secretary
or
so.
and
maybe
so,
i
doubt
it
but
maybe
so
but
that
was
not
the
question
in
the
case.
the
question
was,
what
was
the
relationship?
how
far
could
they
follow
up
this
relationship
by
the
information
they
got
from
the
documents
in
order
to
find
--
find
whether
union
funds
are
being
misappropriated
to
find
what
--
whether
there
was
in
fact
going
to
be
or
whether
there
was
now
a
clean
up
of
the
corruption
within
the
teamsters
union.
so
that
to
say
that
none
of
this
information
was
pertinent
seems
to
go
fly
in
the
face
of
the
actual
--
the
actual
facts
allowed,
the
actual
facts
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
it's
--
i
have
to
say
directly
or
pertinency
of
the
question
in
a
contempt
of
congress
case.
i
suppose
--
or
at
least
the
government
took
this
position
at
trial
and
i
think
it's
--
it's
a
very
legitimate
one
that
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
--
issue
of
pertinency
here
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
issue
of
pertinency
in
those
two
instances
of
perjury
and
contempt
of
congress.
and
of
course,
there
can
be
no
question
either
as
to
the
evidence
that
mr.
presser
was
indeed
aware
of
what
the
committee
was
doing
and
what
it
was
after
at
pages
11
to
12
of
our
brief.
we
go
into
great
detail
summarizing
the
evidence
then,
that
he
did
indeed
have
a
very
clear
motive
to
destroy
these
documents
because
his
relationship
to
any
of
these
people
named
on
the
doc
--
in
the
documents,
in
the
invoice
and
so
on
would
what
have
a
direct
bearing
as
to
his
whole
role
with
respect
to
certain
--
respect
to
the
practices
in
the
teamsters
union.
and
finally,
there
certainly
was
clear
evidence
and
indeed
last
thursday
when
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
whether
there's
any
question
that
mr.
presser
had
possession
of
these
documents,
there
just
wasn't
any
question.
and
indeed
when
presser
attempted
to
raise
an
alibi,
the
alibi
that
during
these
four
days,
september
9th
through
13th,
he
was
in
washington
conferring
with
mr.
hoffa,
the
government
introduced
testimony
to
show
that
on
september
11th,
september
10th
and
11th,
mr.
hoffa
put
in
person-to-person,
long
distance
telephone
calls
to
cleveland
to
mr.
presser.
and
mr.
presser
accepted
these
calls
and
discussed
various
matters
for
a
period
of
time
with
him.
so
there's
no
question
that
he
was
in
cleveland.
that
he
attempted
an
alibi
which
failed
and
that
he
indeed
have
possession.
and
therefore,
though
the
evidence
was
certainly
circumstantial
that
he
in
fact
defaced,
mutilated
the
document
or
withheld
it,
it
was
pretty
clear
in
light
of
the
motive
and
all
the
other
evidence
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
senator
mcclellan's
testimony
went
to
--
well,
i
suppose
we
could
put
it
up
into
four
categories,
perhaps
more.
but
essentially,
the
pertinency
of
the
specific
inquiries
to
the
general
investigation,
secondly
the
pertinency
of
the
documents
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
invest
--
of
the
particular
inquiries.
thirdly
the
knowledge
of
the
petitioner
and
as
far
as
the
knowledge
is
concerned
to
be
sure
senator
mcclellan
couldn't
say,
“well,
i
know
for
a
fact
the
petitioner
knew
this.”
but
what
he
did
testify
to
is
whether
various
matters
of
the
committee
were
public
knowledge
that
the
--
there
--
that
the
unions
had
been
put
on
notice
that
they
were
in
--
that
the
committee
was
investigating
various
things.
and
i
suppose
to
try
and
prove
the
element
of
knowledge,
you
first
have
to
show
at
least
what
it
was
knowledge
--
of
what
it
was
knowledge
and
--
and
so
that
mcclellan's
testimony
did
--
senator
mcclellan's
testimony
did
go
to
knowledge
in
that
respect.
and
ultimately,
certainly
did
testify
to
motive
of
petitioner
because
by
merely
stating
what
the
--
what
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
was
by
stating
what
the
nature
of
these
particular
documents
were,
and
what
mr.
hoffa's
promised
has
been
as
far
as
cleaning
up.
certainly,
one
can
infer
motive
and
then
later
on
of
course
when
mr.
presser
himself
testified
he
admitted
knowledge
of
various
things
which
we
point
out
at
pages
11
to
12.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
the
objection
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
there
were
various
objections.
there
were
three
specific
objections
and
the
rest
were
all
general.
let's
see.
his
objections
were
mostly
--
you
can
--
the
testimony
is
at
pages
16
to
48
of
the
record.
now
his
only
specific
objections
were
three
in
number
that
it
was
unnecessary
for
the
senator
to
testify
with
respect
to
the
committee's
authorizing
resolutions
because
those
documents,
"spoke
for
themselves."
that's
at
record
page
19.
secondly
that
the
testimony
beyond
the
authorizing
resolutions
was
self-serving
and
that's
at
page
20.
and
thirdly,
that
any
testimony
as
to
information
concerning
senator
bender
which
the
chairman
had
received
was
hearsay.
that's
at
pages
31
and
32.
and
of
course,
these
were
answered
by
the
--
by
the
committee
for
example
with
respect
to
this
hearsay,
to
be
sure
it
was
hearsay
but
the
importance
was
not
whether
in
fact
it
was
true
but
how
--
what
was
the
impetuous
be
--
behind
the
committee's
decision
to
start
investigating
the
relationship
of
bender
to
the
teamsters
union
and
so
on.
beyond
that
everything
was
general
objection
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
never,
never.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
petitioners
were
--
or
its
counsel's
particular
actions
with
respect
to
their
request
and
charge
would
seem
to
indicate
to
me
at
least
sir,
that
this
was
a
calculated
trial
tactic.
if
we
can't
have
it
one
way,
we're
going
to
try
to
have
another.
and
if
we
lose
on
this
then
we
can
raise
the
objection
again,
saying
to
the
court
i
suppose
this
goes
to
substantial
rights
of
the
individual
should
be
noticed
as
clear
error.
well,
certainly
it
isn't
clear
error.
it
was
far
from
it.
it
was
hardly
prejudicial.
it
was
the
type
of
thing
that
he
would
have
--
perhaps
even
more
prejudice
if
the
judge
made
the
decision
because
they
were
as
a
matter
of
law
pertinent.
so,
as
far
as
senator
mcclellan's
testimony,
we
don't
believe
there
really
is
any
question
as
to
admissibility.
perhaps,
in
all
candor,
can
i
say,
there
was
an
instance,
the
sheridan
testimony,
in
which
the
senator
read
from
sheridan's
testimony
and
this
is
objected
to
by
petitioner
because
he
said
this
corroborated
sheridan's
subsequent
testimony.
but
first
of
all
when
she
point
out
that
the
court
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
over
and
over
again
said
to
the
jury,
“mind
you,
this
is
not
for
corroboration,
not
at
all.
we're
trying
to
show
that
mr.
schaffer”,
who
was
the
investigator,
“had
authority
to
go
to
cleveland
to
carry
on
this
investigation
in
relationship
with
bender."
then
he
had
authority
to
examine
documents
that
in
fact
it
--
and
it
also
goes
to
the
committee's
interest
in
and
its
knowledge
of
what
precisely
happened
at
the
time.
now,
perhaps
it's
true
that
per
--
this
testimony
need
not
have
been
read.
but
the
fact
that
it
was
read
within
the
--
it
seems
to
me
is
not
prejudicial
error.
especially
one
should
note
that
in
all
essential
respects,
sheridan's
testimony
and
presser's
testimony
as
to
the
--
what
happened
during
those
--
that
period
of
time.
the
first
visit
on
the
9th
and
the
second
visit
on
the
13th
that
they
essentially
were
the
same.
oh,
they
disagreed
as
to
for
example
whether
sheridan
--
whether
presser
refused
to
give
it
because
he
wanted
the
documents
photostated
or
whether
he
wanted
a
receipt.
but
that
wasn't
the
essential
thing.
the
important
thing
was
that
sheridan
went
there.
that
he
asked
to
see
the
documents
that
presser
indeed
allowed
him
to
see
the
documents.
that
when
he
requested
the
documents
for
some
reasons
or
other,
presser
said,
“could
you
come
back
at
another
time?”
and
sheridan
said,
“yes,
i'll
return
within
a
few
days.”
and
during
that
period
of
time,
the
documents
were
destroyed.corroborate
if
anything,
sheridan
corroborated
presser.
presser
corroborated
sheridan
as
to
the
essential
points.
and
since
there
was
careful
admonition
that
mcclellan,
senator
mcclellan's
testimony
relating
to
sheridan
had
no
corroborative
effect,
i
should
think
it
would
not
have
been
error.
it
should
have
--
it
should've
been
within
his
broad
discretion.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
the
--
but--
but
the
thing
is
the
resolution
isn't.
this
--
though
it
may
be
the
source
it
is
not
the
--
from
reading
the
--
you're
not
--
you
don't
understand
just
precisely
how
you
put
these
--
these
few
lines
of
the
resolution
into
operative
effect.
and
certainly,
there
has
never
been
any
question
up
to
now
that
a
testimony
from
a
committee
had
--
is
--
is
inadmissible.
i've
point
out
for
example
the
douche
case,
although
that
of
course
was
not
a
jury
trial.
it
was
a
trial
to
the
judge.
but
even
so,
there
was
--
a
member
of
the
committee
was
allowed
to
testify
as
to
precisely
what
happened.
beyond
that,
the
resolution
itself
would
never
had
given
any
information
as
to
what
the
specific
inquiries
were
relating
to
misuse
and
misappropriation,
relating
to
senator
bender,
relating
to
the
racketeer's
and
so
on.
i
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
presumably
to
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
the
relevancy
surely
--
for
example,
to
i
suppose
--
reinforce
what
the
words
of
the
authorizing
resolution
did
in
fact
say
that
--
that
the
extra
practice
was
for
these
investigators
to
go
out
and
to
examine
documents.
for
example,
there's
nothing
in
the
resol
--
the
resolution
discussing
the
setting
up
of
field
offices.
but
surely
that
was
a
practice
which
the
committee
engaged
in.
there
was
nothing
as
to
the
--
sort
of
relationship
of
the
general
counsel
to
the
investigators,
only
in
the
resolution
saying
that
there
shall
be
a
general
counsel,
that
too
was
necessary
in
order
to
trace
out
the
background.
and
besides
that
getting
back
to
what
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
at
the
very
beginning
of
my
argument
that
since
the
crime
does
discuss
what
is
the
--
the
offense
deals
with
duly
authorized
and
proper
inquiry
of
congress,
i
think
that
it
should
--
the
jury
should
not
be
allowed
to
decide
this
question
or
the
judge
to
decide
this
question
in
a
vacuum
of
--
of
--
here
is
the
document
which
they're
operating
under.
never
mind
what
--
what
the
realities
are,
never
mind
how
they
do
in
fact
operate,
never
mind
the
flesh
and
blood
of
it.
this
is
the
authorizing
resolution.
this
is
what
happened.
you
make
your
decision.
i
think
it
was
perfectly
proper
and
hardly
prejudicial
to
allow
this
type
of
testimony.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh,
there
were.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
that's
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
quite
right
but
none
of
them,
none
of
them
went
to
whether
or
not
this
should
have
been
presented
to
the
--
to
the
jury
as
opposed
to
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
that's
right.
oh,
i
agree,
it's
saying
that
this
was
prejudicial
because
you
shouldn't
be
allowed
--
well,
certainly
for
example
the
identification
of
the
names
on
the
documents
where
--
was
it
rather
important
thing
i
should
think.
it's
--
its
one
thing
for
example
if
you
had
eight
names
which
were
the
listings
of
secretaries.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
i
suppose
it
didn't
make
any
difference
at
all
and
of
course
at
that
particular
discussion
in
the
evidence
was
ultimately
stricken
from
the
record
or
say
--
the
judge
said,
“well,
this
is
irrelevant.”
when
they
-–
when
they
disc
--
were
discussing
mr.
kennedy
and
his
--
his
being
a
general
counsel
and
going
into
all
the
related
details,
finally
the
judge
has
said
that
the
objection
would
be
sustained
to
that.
and
i'll
have
the
page
number
immediately
on
that.
but
none
of
that,
none
of
that
testimony
was
prejudicial
--
it
may
have
been
superfluous,
it
may
have
been
superfluous
but
not
prejudicial,
i
think
it
was.
but
example
when
they
did
get
in
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i
suppose
to
trace
the
background
of
the
committee.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
for
example,
on
page
23,
well
perhaps
no
difference
in
all
because
the
judge
said
--
well,
mr.knachel
said,
“objection
your
honor,
may
i
have
the
objections
to
this
line
of
inquiry
at
page
23.”
and
the
judge
said,
“yes,
i
don't
see
how
material
it
is
who
the
counsel
was,
whether
he
was
mr.kennedy,
whether
he
was
now
in
the
employ
of
the
government
at
the
present
time
and
in
what
capacity.”
in
general,
senator
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
page
23,
could
you
state
what
the
duties
of
committee
counsel
were?
i
think
that
the
duties
of
committee
counsel
was
rather
important
although
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
they
con
--
they
--
they
continued
discussing
the
duties
of
committee
counsel
and
the
duties
of
the
investigators.
certainly,
it
was
important
to
know
in
details
that
the
investigators
had
the
right
to
go
to
request
the
documents
--
to
look
at
the
documents,
to
examine
them
even
prior
to
subpoena.
this
was
the
--
and
--
and
indeed
in
this
situation
mr.
presser
allowed
them
to
look
through
the
files
before
the
specific
request
for
the
four
particular
files
in
which
the
documents
existed,
were
actually
with
--
before
sheridan
made
the
request
and
before
the
request
was
refused
for
--
for
reasons
other
than
imperfection
or
defects
in
subpoena
and
so
on.
as
matter
of
fact,
we
now
--
i
--
i
suppose
we
do
come
to
this
question
of
the
validity
of
the
subpoena
which
is
the
remaining
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that
was
in
relation
to
the
interim
report.
that's
at
--
beginning
at
page
25
of
the
record
and
in
page
27
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
the
purpose
again
--
the
purpose
again
was
to
show
pertinency
of
the
inquiries,
what
were
they
looking
for.
and
--
and
the
--
first
of
all,
senator
mcclellan
said,
“yes,
among
the
unions
that
were
--
we
were
investigating
was
the
teamsters
union.
and
secondly,
there
were
recommendations,
legis
--
general
legislative
recommendations.”
and
at
page
27,
he
goes
into
little
summary,
first
of
all
legislation
to
regulate
and
control
pension
and
health
and
welfare
funds,
secondly,
legislation
to
regulate
and
control
union
funds,
thirdly,
legislation
to
ensure
union
democracy,
and
then
the
fourth
and
fifth
are
not
that
pertinent
to
the
specific
instances
here.
now,
certainly
that
was
pertinent
to
whether
or
not
a
union
can
pay
a
$100
each
for
christmas
gifts
for
particular
people,
especially
union
officials,
public
officials,
people
who
had
reputed
unsavory
reputations.
the
problem
of
union
democracy
certainly
was
involved
here.
what
right
did
the
union
have
to
pay
these
funds?
thus
they
had
amassed
from
the
--
from
the
union
members
without
--
without
any
discussion
of
it
with
the
union
members,
and
so
on,
and
so
forth.
so
that
--
and
mind
you,
this
interim
report
was
not
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury
whatsoever.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
the
--
here,
at
page
213
of
the
record,
the
court
specifically
excluded
the
interim
report
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you'll
notice
that
the
interim
report,
that
portion
of
it
which
related
to
what
senator
mcclellan
said
is
--
begins
at
page
30
--
388
of
the
record.
now,
that
is
merely
put
in
there
for
the
--
for
this
court
to
examine.
it
was
not
presented
to
the
jury.
none
of
the
information
and
among
which
was
--
were
specific
references
to
presser
himself,
none
of
this
was
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury.
the
only
thing
that
was
allowed
to
go
the
jury
was
the
testimony
as
to
the
legislative
recommendations
and
the
testimony
as
to
which
unions
they're
investigating
and
what's
senator
mcclellan
said.
the
--
the
interim
report
was
excluded
though
at
page
213.
so
the
jury
had
none
of
this
to
prejudice
them
in
anyway.
now,
we
do
come
to
the
issue
of
the
subpoena
and
whether
the
chances
that
the
subpoena
was
signed
in
blank
by
the
senator
and
filled
in
by
the
investigators
in
cleveland,
vitiated
the
conviction,
excused
the
deliberate
destruction
of
the
documents.
we
discussed
this
at
great
length
in
our
brief
and
i
think
that
in
a
few
minutes
remaining,
what
i
would
like
to
really
discuss
is
this
issue
on
the
assumption,
even
--
or
even
assuming
that
the
subpoena
is
invalid,
even
assuming
that
the
defect
in
the
subpoena
was
sufficient
to
invalidate
the
subpoena.
the
question
here
was,
is
a
subpoena
necessary,
necessary
for
the
crime
of
obstructing
the
committee
inquiry.
now,
in
cases
arising
under
the
related
obstruction
of
justice
statute,
involving
the
intimidation
and
impeding
of
witnesses,
courts
have
uniformly
said
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
pardon.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh
yes
before
courts,
that's
right
or
judicial
officers.
this
is
18
u.s.c.
1503.
and
why
--
why
i
used
these
cases
instead
of
1505
is
because
there
are
very
few
1505
cases,
(inaudible)
case
which
is
recently
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
about
the
only
one
that
i
know
of
in
addition
to
this.
i
suppose
the
real
reason
is
because
in
many
instances
the
people
who
do
in
fact
obstruct
a
committee
inquiry
obstructed
in
the
course
of
the
testimony
so
that
instead
the
congress
cites
them
for
contempt
and
these
cases
therefore
arise
here
under
the
contempt
statute
rather
than
under
the
obstruction
of
the
committee
inquiry.
at
any
rate,
in
those
cases
under
1503
is
being
uniformly
stated
by
the
courts
and
an
offense
maybe
committed
even
though
the
witness
involved
is
not
under
a
subpoena.
all
that
is
required
say
the
courts
is
that
the
witness
have
an
expectation
that
he
is
going
to
be
called
before
court
or
judicial
officer
or
even
further
that
only
the
court
or
the
judicial
officer
have
an
expectation
that
it's
going
to
call
the
witness.
and
we
cite
cases
at
brief
the
page
24
in
all
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
well,
there
are
cases.
there
are
certainly,
there
was
a
russell
case,
there
is
the
mccracken
case.
those
cases
involved
subpoenas
and
i
should
in
all
candor
admit
that
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
case
which
involved
on
the
facts
of
the
case
itself
that
no
subpoena
was
involved.
now,
the
courts
have
uniformly
stated
when
the
set
down
the
broad
principles.
and
i
especially
refer
this
court
to
smith
versus
united
states
of
274
federal
at
page
253
which
we
cited
in
our
brief.
this
--
that
among
the
--
the
sort
of
operating
principles
relating
to
1503,
a
subpoena
is
not
necessary.
the
witness
need
not
be
--
under
a
subpoena.
all
that
is
required
is
that
there'd
be
an
expectation
that
he's
going
to
be
called
either
by
himself
or
by
the
court
or
judicial
officer.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
he
must
be
a
potential
witness.
he
must
--
although
this
potentiality
must,
i
suppose
be
communicate
because
knowledge
is
a
vital
--
vital
importance.
in
other
words,
part
and
parcel
of
this
expectation
that
he
is
going
to
be
a
witness
must
be
the
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
impedes
or
intimidates
the
witness
that
he
is
going
to
be
a
potential
witness
or
that
he
is
going
to
be
--
or
there
is
an
expectation
that
he
will
be
called.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
i'm
--
that
--
this
is
150
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
i
think
that
--
well,
we're
--
i'm
only
dealing
with
this
intimidation
of
witness
as
itself.
when
we
come
to
1505,
dealing
with
obstruction,
i
would
relate
it,
analogize
the
witness
cases
to
this
by
saying
that
documents
need
not
be
under
subpoena
in
order
to
constitute
an
obstruction
of
unlawful
inquiry
of
a
committee
of
congress.
let
me
take
an
example.
supposing
there
had
been
no
subpoena
in
this
case,
supposing
sheridan
under
his
lawful
authority
as
senator
mcclellan
testified,
supposing
he
had
come
to
get
the
--
to
investigate,
to
examine
the
documents
and
he
arrived
to
presser's
office
and
requested
these
documents
and
presser
said,
“oh
no,
you
are
not
going
to
see
these
documents,
much
less
take
these
documents
away
unless
you
have
a
subpoena.”
and
sheridan
goes
and
--
to
get
a
subpoena
and
in
their
interim,
presser
destroys
the
documents.
i
cannot
believe
under
the
authority
of
the
witness
cases
as
well,
it's
just
common
sense
that
presser
should
have
been
allowed
to
have
the
license
to
deliberately
destroy
the
documents
merely
because
a
subpoena
didn't
exist
at
the
time.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
i
suppose
that
--
that
then
--
then
sheridan
would
have
been
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
mind
you,
i'm
not
--
you
don't
have
to
be
a
potential
witness
to
have
an
obstruction
of
a
congressional
committee.
1503
deals
with
witnesses
among
other
things,
and
the
intimidation
of
witnesses
by
third
parties,
and
what
i'm
doing
is
analogizing
that
to
the
destruction
of
documents
by
particular
--
or
whether
the
documents
need
be
under
subpoena.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right
or
it
have
an
expect
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
that's
right,
because
we're
not
dealing
--
all
we're
saying
is
that
there
must
be
an
obstruction
of
a
lawful
inquiry
and
--
and
that
obstruction
may
take
place
in
any
number
of
--
of
--
of
ways.
i'll
go
--
well,
one
step
further
i
suppose
as
to
say
supposing
there
had
been
a
subpoena
which
was
invalid
on
its
face
instead
of
being
issued
to
joint
council
41,
was
issued
to
joint
council
23
and
instead
of
william
presser
as
president,
it
was
served
on
--
well,
they
thought
it
was
to
be
served
on
john
jones.
well
here,
being
invalid
on
its
face,
presser's
says
to
sheridan,
“no,
you
can't
have
it
until
there
is
valid
subpoena.”
i
can't
believe
that
this
would
give
a
license
to
presser
to
destroy
the
documents
before
a
valid
subpoena
was
issued.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
you
can't
--
well
of
course,
here
the
present
case
is
completely
different.
the
present
case,
you
have
a
subpoena
issued
which
all
parties
accept
as
valid.
they
operate
for
six
months
prior
to
particular
case
on
the
assumption
that
it's
valid.
the
joint
council
works
out
a
whole
--
means
by
which
is
going
to
deliver
documents
to
--
through
its
accountant
to
the
cleveland
field
office.
the
committee
of
congress
waives
his
right
to
have
the
committee
--
to
have
the
documents
produced
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
and
--
and
we
of
course
argue
that
there
was
a
ratification.
i
think
that
has
to
be
derived
rather
than
out
and
out
discussion
because
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
i
don't
know.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
supposing
for
example,
he
had
brought
the
--
presser
had
been
subpoenaed
to
testify
and
subsequently
he
was
subpoenaed
to
bring
documents
with
him.
and
in
the
committee
room,
just
before
testifying,
he
suddenly
discovers
or
the
things
that
there
is
a
defect
in
the
subpoena
to
bring
the
documents.
i
can't
believe
that
then
he
could
then
in
there
before
all
committee
members
destroy
those
records
with
impunity.
this
is
not
what
the
cases
hold.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
and
it
is
our
--
it
is
our
contention
that
no
subpoena
is
necessary.
certainly,
it
is
not
required
by
statute.
certainly
in
any
of
the
analogous
cases,
a
subpoena
of
a
witness
before
the
witness
can
be
impeded
or
intimidated
need
not
exist.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
in
those
circumstances,
i
would
say
this
that
he
still
does
not
have
the
right
to
destroy
the
documents.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
he
doesn't
have
the
right
to
destroy
it.
that
what
he
has
is
to
say,
“well,
i
question
whether
this
is
the
--
the
process
of
the
committee.”
and
the
least
that
we
should
require
of
him,
the
least
is
for
him
to
appear
before
the
committee
or
before
a
law
--
a
lawfully
authorized
subcommittee,
or
whatever
have
you
and
say,
“i
am
appearing
here
especially
and
--
and
--
and
questioning
the
jurisdiction
of
this
committee
or
whatever
have
you
because
the
subpoena
is
invalid,
because
he
filled
it
in.
then
at
least,
this
allows
the
committee
to
rectify
anything
or
to
say,
“oh,
this
is
a
horrible
mistake.
mr.
sheridan
has
been
acting
outside
his
authority.
you
--
we
never
wanted
you
at
all.
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
particular
inquiry.”
in
other
words
as
mr.
justice
jackson
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
to
the
fleming-mohawk
case,
the
importance
is
not
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
subpoena
or
whether
it's
signed
in
blank.
the
importance
is
that
the
committee
who's
lawful
pro
--
process
it
purports
to
be
that
the
committee
had
the
right
to
make
the
ultimate
decision
to
have
a
hearing,
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
go
--
it
qualify
that
somewhat.
supposing
indeed
in
the
--
of
course
a
business,
you
destroy
documents
every
five
years
and
the
committee
says,
“in
two
months,
we
are
conducting
investigation
now
with
relationship
to
us
and
so.
and
in
two
months,
we're
going
to
get
to
your
particular
corporation
or
your
particular
union
and
we're
going
to
re
--
investigate
your
--
your
documents
going
back
10
years.
therefore,
we
respectfully
request
that
you
save
those
documents.”
i
don't
believe
in
those
circumstances
he
can
destroy
and
even
if
it
is
the
lawful
course
of
business,
however,
if
the
committee
says,
“in
1962
that
we're
undertaking
a
long
range
investigation.”
and
in
five
years
from
now,
we'll
get
to
you,
therefore
don't
destroy
documents.”
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
or
would
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i
think
you
have
to
read
into
this
and
to
the
request,
the
concept
of
reasonable
request.
he
--
well,
he
should
--
he
certainly
knows
in
this
circumstance
that
these
documents
were
pertinent.
he
knows
that
this
is
what
the
committee
was
--was
wanted
and
desired.
they
wanted
to
examine
it
whether
or
not
the
subpoena
existed
under
these
circumstances
to
put
these
documents
beyond
the
reach
of
the
committee
forever
by
destroying
them.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
not
within
the
proper
--
it
seems
to
me
to
be
precisely
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
this
is
precisely
what
congress
intended
to
do
by
promulgating
the
statute
to
prevent
just
this
type
of
obstruction.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i'm
not
sure.
i
--
it
--
i
would
just
venture
to
say
that
probably
some
do
not
have
the
right
of
--
of
subpoena.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
the
statute
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
yes
because
--
the
statute
covers
administrative
agencies
as
well.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
there
only
been
about
two
or
three
at
most.
this
case
of
course,
there
was
the
(inaudible)
case
dealing
with
congressional
inquiry.
then
there
were
several
others
dealing
with
the
administrative
agencies
and
among
the
cases
we
cite
are
--
are
--
in
our
brief
are
some,
but
very
few.
and
i
think
and
when
you
run
through
the
u.s.--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
about
--
about
three
or
four
again,
about
three
or
four.
you'll
--
that
they're
all
listed
except
for
this
(inaudible)
case
and
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
here
in
the
u.s.
code
annotated.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i'm
not
sure.
i
--
i
think
so
in
--
in
the
situation
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
i
don't
believe
that
this
--
well,
that
--
in
this
particular
--
okay.
i
don't
believe
that
this
particular
question
of
whether
this
--
you
need
a
subpoena
or
not
has
been
ever
litigated
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
there
have
been
many
statements
by
courts
in
--
in
discussing
general
principles
which
have
in
dictum
said
so
and
indeed
even
the
dictum
in
the
1503
cases
go
this
far.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
as
far
as
i
know
--
well,
i
don't
know
whether
state
courts
have
gone
there
--
have
ever
gone
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i'm
just
--
probably.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
probably
so.
of
course,
there's
a
venerable
history
of
the
obstruction
of
justice
statutes
and
--
and
there
are
many
cases
there.
but
this
--
this
was
brought
in
relatively
late
to
--
to
cure
what
congress
considered
to
be
a
gap
in
the
whole
obstruction
of
justice.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
we
don't
concede
the
invalidity
of
the
subpoena
at
all
and
we
discussed
it
in
terms
of
ratification
of
waiver
by
the
petitioner
in
the
sense
that
he
(inaudible)
--
after
the
march
subpoena
had
been
issued
in
--
in
april,
he
--
another
subpoena
was
issued
in
which
it
says,
“the
committee
waives
the
production
of
documents
in
washington
that
you've
delivered
to
the
cleveland
office.”
i
think
that
construing
the
record
as
a
whole
one
may
find
sufficient
validity
but
we
do
not
stand
or
fall
on
validity.
we
say
that
the
subpoena
alone
is
not
necessary
for
the
crime
of
obstruction.
and
in
fact,
i
suppose
prefer
to
--
to
base
our
argument
on
this
because
the
flaunting
of
the
law,
the
flaunting
of
the
lawful
process
of
the
--
of
the
committee
to
us
is
serious
enough
to
go
beyond
the
technical
requirements
of
the
subpoena
or
not
a
subpoena.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
the
cudahy
case,
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
the
cudahy,
yes.
and
then
there
is
the
fleming,
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
in
cud
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
they
were.
cudahy
was
a
--
a
delegation
of
the
subpoena
issuing
power
to
a
law
--
to
a
reach
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
--
(inaudible)
--
to
a
subordinate
and
the
court
found
that
in
that
situation,
there
was
no
basis
in
the
statute
for
delegation.
and
in
the
fleming
case,
the
court
held
that
the
--
the
delegation
was
allowable
under
this
statute
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
you
can't
say.
but
if
it
was
--
this
was
allowable
and
indeed
and
then
justice
jackson
went
on
to
say,
the
important
thing
in
this
is
to
allow
the
con
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it
was
five-to-four
yes,
yes.
and
--
and
of
course
in
this
case,
we
--
we
don't
at
all
say
that
this
is
a
delegation
to
a
subordinate.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
this
is
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
in
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
--
well,
that's
right
and
the
subordinate
was
allowed
to
issue
these
subpoenas
at
will
without
any
--
without
any
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
and
the
person
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
that's
right.
i
--
i
should
point
out
--
my
time
is
up
and
i'll
--
but
i
should
point
out
that
the
--
the
april
subpoena
which
no
one
questions,
the
april
subpoena
which
was
indeed
a
lawful
process
of
the
committee
with
is
put
in
exactly
the
same
terms.
the
--
the
documents
it
request
are
exactly
the
same
kinds
of
documents
that
are
requested
in
march
subpoena,
only
in
the
march
subpoena
joint
--
the
--
the
records
asked
by
for
joint
council
and
in
the
april
joint
council
welfare
funds
and
special
other
funds.
but
--
so
it
would
seem
that
the
request
for
cash
disbursing
checks
and
for
records
and
so
on,
it's
a
form
which
the
committee
itself
must
have
worked
out
and
which
is
--
was
just
an
automatic
thing
to
put
--
put
into
this
(inaudible)
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
yes.
it
--
it
is
if
you
get
to
that
point.
what
they
say
is
that
it
was
a
delegation
rather
than
the
signing
point.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
then
i'm
not
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh,
oh.
that
--
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
i
--
i
am
not
familiar
with
those
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
what
was
requested
for
them?
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
thank
you.
