warren
number
278,
william
presser,
petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
cardinal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cardinal,
i
was
wondering
if
--
if
this
petitioner
read
in
the
newspapers
that
as
a
result
of
investigation
of
the
committee
that
these
documents
were
needed
by
the
committee
and
that
the
committee
intended
to
get
it
from
him.
and
thereafter,
he
destroyed
them
or
altered
to
do
so
they
were
not
to
tell
the
truth.
would
he
have
committed
the
crime
under
the
section?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
is
the
wording
of
the
lan
--
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
limited
to
threats
or
force
and
things
of
that
kind.
is
that
the
reason
it
wouldn't
be
a
violation?
and
the
--
and
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
there
was
no
element
of
force
or
threats
or
anything
of
that
kind.
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
have
--
what
--
what
distinction?
i'd
like
to
get
the
other
distinction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
a
more
general
question
than
the
one
that
i
did
then?
does
a
person
who
destroys
or
alters
his
records
to
avoid
investigation
of
his
--
of
his
documents,
bring
in
within
the
act
or
does
it
not
bring
him
within
the
act
unless
he
has
been
subpoenaed?
in
other
words,
if
he
just
hears
--
hears
about
it
and
hears
that
the
investigation
is
going
on,
is
he
authorized
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
to
destroy
his
records
or
alter
his
records
so
they
cannot
be
used
by
the
committee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
all
we're
talking
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
here,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
well
i
just
wonder
--
ask
on
--
i'm
not
arguing
with
you
on
it
though.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cardinal,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
taken
from
this
hearsay
evidence,
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
say,
were
those
remarks
derogatory
remarks
about
his
associates
taken
from
that
hearsay
evidence
that
you've
just
been
telling
us
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
position
did
defense
counsel
take
on
at
that
time
on
a
question
of
whether
this
is
one
of
law
or
one
of
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
meant
on
submitting
--
question
of
submitting
it
to
the
jury
or
having
--
having
the
court
decide
it
as
a
matter
of
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
position
of
defense
counsel
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
is
just
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
you
may
mr.
cardinal.
mr.
medalie.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
does
it
go
on
beyond
that
--
or
it
says
on
purpose
of
such
inquiry
investigation
and
--
and
charge
the
jury
that
it
must
find
on
that
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
oh,
you're
going
through
that,
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
argument
or
in
the
offer
of
proof?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
--
i
--
i
just
want
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
--
it
wasn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
was
asking
because
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
this
hearsay
testimony
was
used
by
the
prosecutor
for
purposes
other
than
pertinency
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
his
presentation
to
the
jury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
stated
to
counsel
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
this
issue
first
raised
mr.
medalie?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
one
who
we've
just
--
you've
just
discussed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
meant
--
i
meant
when
--
when
did
the
--
the
petitioner
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
first
raised
it
as
having
been
error?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl

perhaps
it's
like
this,
never
been
construed
by
the
state
court
so
far
as
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cardinal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
--
this
have
not
--
this
question
has
nothing
to
do
with
direct
examination,
the
questioning?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
to
his
position
and
as
a
result
of
(inaudible)
the
murder
of
his
predecessor
and
that
he
was
elected
(inaudible).
that's
the
first
time
i've
heard
that
(inaudible)?
is
that
--
is
that
have
anything
to
do
--
of
the
question
at
least
in
your
opinion?
the
question
is
directed
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
i
asked
mr.

department
of

chief
justice
earl
warren
number
25,
william
presser,
petitioner
versus
united
states.
mr.
cardinal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
were
you
going
to
discuss
the
evidence
of
senator
mcclellan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
introduced
them
on
the
grounds
of
pertinency,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
evidence
objected
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
pollak.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pollak,
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
question
that
was
asked
of
senator
mcclellan
and
his
answer
to
the
effect
that
what
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
had
interfered
with
his
committee?
now
for
a
prominent
man
--
for
a
man
of
his
stature
to
go
before
an
ordinary
lay
jury
and
state
as
his
conclusion,
the
ultimate
fact
that
they
were
required
to
determine
that
the
man
had
obstructed
the
work
of
his
committee.
do
you
think
that's
inconsequential
or
first,
do
you
think
it's
--
do
you
think
it
was
proper
to
ask
that
question
to
get
that
answer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
just
what
--
with
that
proper
--
do
you
think
it
was
a
proper
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
no,
that
is
--
that
isn't
the
question.
i
asked
you
mr.
pollak,
do
you
think
it's
a
proper
question
or
improper?
then
we
can
discuss
whether
if
you
say
it
isn't,
then
we
can
discuss
whether
it
was
prejudicial
or
not
but
do
you
believe
that
was
a
proper
question
and
a
permissible
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
objected
too?
