justice
potter
stewart
how
far
does
your
theory
go
in
this
respect?
let
me
ask
you
this,
for
example,
let's
assume
you're
interrogating
a
witness,
one
of
your
witnesses,
one
of
your
--
the
key
witnesses
in
your
case
and
you
proceeded
to
ask
him
some
questions
in
the
--
on
objection,
the
court
said
that's
entirely
an
inadmissible
line
of
inquiry
and
you
--
it
was
clear
to
you
and
everybody
else
in
the
courtroom
that
the
--
that
the
judge
was
entirely
wrong
as
a
matter
of
the
law
of
evidence,
but
you
--
let's
assume
that
you
persisted
and
pursued
the
matter
and
said
that
you
intended
to
do
so
unless
bailiff
stops
you.
would
that
be
a
--
would
you
be
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
exactly
in
the
same
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we're
assuming
that
the
--
that
the
judge's
order
was
entirely
unlawful,
that
it
–
that
it
was
entirely
contrary
to
the
law
of
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
assumption
of
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
i
still
don't
understand
the
answer
to
my
question.
i
don't
understand,
really,
your
theory
as
to
what
lawful
or
unlawful
order
is.
it's
your
point
that
if
the
judge
is
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law
in
the
order
that
he
gives,
that
you
are
free
to
not
only
disregard
it
but
to
disregard
it
contemptuously?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
-–
what
is
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
what,
very
erroneous?
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
that
differ?
how
does
that
differ
from
my
case?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
assume
your
whole
case
collapses
without
the
testimony
of
this
witness,
in
my
hypothetical
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
all
rules
of
law
are
supposed
to
be
binding
on
the
court
as
well
as
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
that
have
to
do
with
the
issue
which
had
been
segregated,
the
issue
of
public
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
under
the
trial
judge's
theory
which
you
say
was
erroneous,
that
the
issue
of
public
damage
was
to
be
segregate
and
tried
first
and
that
the
--
all
the
conspiracy
issues
were
to
be
tried
later.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
you're
trying
to
get
in
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
--
with
the
issue
which
he
had
said
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
try
it
separately.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
