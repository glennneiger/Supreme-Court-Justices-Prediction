mr.
philip
r.
monahan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
it's
true
in
so
many
cases,
the
issue
here
turns
very
largely
on
the
facts.
i
would
like
--
i
would
like
now
to
point
out
that
contrary
to
the
position
that
has
been
taken
by
my
opponent,
there
was
no
interference
with
the
right
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
civil
antitrust
suit
to
make
any
offer
of
proof
he
chose
to,
and
i
think
that
the
best
witness
of
that
is
mr.
mcconnell
himself,
as
i
shall
now
point
out.
in
volume
3,
page
1035
of
the
record,
in
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
mr.
mcconnell
is
speaking
and
he
says
“i
am
trying
to
make
a
record
here.
we
can't
help
it,
but
sometimes
there
comes,
in
the
lives
of
lawyers
and
judges,
conflicts
where
there
are
issues
raised
where
one
side
is
trying
to
make
a
record,
and
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here.
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
do.”
by
the
court,
“may
i
ask
one
question?”
by
mr.
mcconnell,
“yes.”
by
the
court,
“have
i
stopped
you
from
making
your
record?”
by
mr.
mcconnell,
“no.”
by
the
court,
“haven't
i
sustained
you
all
the
way
to
make
the
record?”
by
mr.
mcconnell,
“you
are
letting
us
make
the
record.”
by
the
court,
“absolutely.”
and
then,
in
the
proceedings
on
the
contempt
itself,
on
volume
5
of
the
record,
this
is
the
thin
volume.
on
page
36,
the
court
said
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“from
the
words
that
you
have
used
and
the
statements
that
are
shown
in
the
record,
there
isn't
any
question
but
you
--
but
that
you
have
exceeded
every
reasonable
limitation
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
but,
i
still
certainly
have
no
malice
in
my
heart.
i
never
did
in
my
life.
i've
been
on
the
bench
23
years
and
i've
never
done
this
before.
there
is
one
thing
one
must
do,
protect
the
record.
over
the
objections
of
the
defense
counsel,
i
think
that
all
the
way
down
the
line,
i
have
let
you
make
your
record
completely.
there's
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence,
not
a
statement
that
will
indicate
that
you
have
been
curtailed
in
any
way
in
making
your
offer
of
proof.
isn't
that
right?”
mr.
thomas
mcconnell,
“well,
we
have
made
our
offers
of
proof.”
the
court,
“completely.”
now,
with
that
as
a
purpose,
i
would
like
to
review
or
re-review
very
briefly
the
circumstances
that
led
up
to
the
allegedly
contemptuous
statement
in
order
to
show
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
judge
miner
had
made
a
categorical
and
definitive
ruling
preventing
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
in
the
civil
suit
from
proceeding
in
the
manner
in
which
they
had
been
proceeding,
namely
by
reading
from
the
deposition
of
mr.
simpson,
questions
bearing
upon
the
so-called
conspiracy
involving
--
with
mr.
cross
at
the
center.
now,
in
the
pages
immediately
pre
--
in
volume
2
of
the
record
at
page
731,
in
the
pages
immediately
preceding
this,
this
process
had
been
going
on
for
page
after
page.
mr.
freeman
would
read
a
question
in
the
deposition
of
mr.
simpson
bearing
upon
this
issue
which
judge
miner
had
ruled,
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
is
certainly
immaterial
for
this
case,
was
not
an
issue
before
the
jury.
and,
the
court
said
it
is
becoming
obvious
that
the
repetition
of
question
after
question
about
the
matter
on
which
the
court
has
ruled
is
not
competent
and
proper
as
distinguished
from
an
offer
of
proof.
it
ought
not
to
be
hammered
and
repeated
before
the
jury
time
and
time
again,
and
i
would
appreciate
it
very
much
if
you
would
make
your
offer
--
if
you
would
make
your
offer
of
proof
in
all
the
conversations,
if
any,
and
mr.
freeman,
interrupting,
said
“excuse
me,
i
have
only
this
problem,
as
mr.
mcconnell
has
well
stated
it.
the
statute
controlling
in
this
regard
is
section
--
rule
43
(b).”
i
might
interpolate
it
at
this
point
to
say
that
the
reference
there
should
have
been
rule
43
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
by
the
court.
that
is
where
i
got
this
from.
by
mr.
freeman,
“it
requires
that
we
do
present
a
witness
and
we
do
go
thru
this
deposition,
although
we
do
it
in
person,
and
we
ask
the
question
which
may
be
objected
to
and
it
is
sustained,
and
then
we
offer
to
prove
what
the
witness
would
say
pursuant
to
that
question.”
then,
skipping
the
next
couple
of
paragraphs
just
for
brevity,
mr.
freeman
resumes
“we
find
ourselves
in
an
uncomfortable
position
of
both
being
accused
of
bad
form,”
he
means
being
accused
by
defense
counsel,
“in
making
the
offer
of
proof
and
being
accused
of
bad
form
when
we
ask
the
question.
i
think
we
have
to
try
to
protect
our
record
by
asking
the
question.”
now,
i
might
explain
at
this
point
that
that
statement
is
correct,
but
the
defense
counsel
had
been
objecting
--
the
defense
counsel
did
not
want
an
offer
of
proof
to
be
made
even
generally.
that
as
a
part
from
there
being
a
witness
on
the
stand,
and
they
did
not
want
the
questions
to
be
asked
of
the
witness
on
the
stand
or
questions
and
answers
read
in
the
case
of
a
deposition.
so,
that
is
perfectly
correct
what
mr.
freeman
said
there.
but,
now,
here
is
the
crucial
part.
by
the
court,
“i
will
not
object
and
i
will
permit
your
form
of
offer
of
proof
in
the
absence
of
the
jury
by
overruling
their
objections
to
the
form.”
the
court
is
now
saying
he's
going
to
overrule
defense
counsel's
objections
to
the
form
of
the
offer
of
proof
that
mr.
mcconnell
and
mr.
freeman
had
originally
wanted,
in
other
words,
the
general
offer
of
proof.
the
court,
continuing,
said
“you
have
had
the
witness
on
the
stand
or
you
have
had
these
depositions
or
you
have
these
depositions,
and
you
have
identified
the
witness
and
you
have
asked
questions
about
conversations
and
about
issues
not
before
this
jury.
the
same
ruling
prevails
on
all
of
the
same
questions
and
if
you
ask
him
a
million
times,
it
will
be
the
same
ruling
and
it
becomes
obvious
to
the
jury
and
to
the
court
that
you
are
merely
repeating
something
that
the
court
had
ruled
on.”
by
mr.
mcconnell
“their
objection
is
right,”
referring
to
the
defense
counsel.
“they
have
made
a
sound
objection
to
proceeding
without
the
witness
or
without
the
deposition,
and
we
have
to
make
a
record
and
your
rulings
are
going
to
be
reviewed.”
by
the
court,
“alright,
but
the
witness
has
been
on
the
stand
and
depositions
are
being
read.”
by
mr.
mcconnell,
“now,
you
are
trying
to
tell
us
we
can't
ask
these
questions.
we
have
a
right
to
ask
these
questions
and,
until
we
are
stopped
from
asking
these
questions,
we
are
going
to
ask
them
because
it
is
our
prerogative
in
doing
it.”
by
the
court,
“i
am
now
stopping
you
from
asking
the
questions
about
conversations
with
mr.cross
because
i
have
ruled
specifically,
definitely,
and
completely
that
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.”
by
mr.
mcconnell,
“we
have
a
right
to
ask
them.”
by
the
court,
“you
can
offer
proof
on
it.”
by
mr.
mcconnell,
“we
have
a
right
to
ask
questions
which
we
offer
on
this
issue
and
your
honor
can
sustain
their
objections
to
them.
we
don't
have
a
right
to
read
the
answers,
but
we
a
right
to
ask
questions
and
we
propose
to
do
so
unless
some
bailiff
stops
us.”
that
was
the
allegedly
contemptuous
statement.
i'd
like
to
go
on
just
a
little
bit
more
because
of
what
follows
is
pertinent
to
the
position
taken
by
judge
duffy
in
his
defense
below.
the
court
said
“well,
i
will
stop
you
now
and
i
don't
appreciate
threats.
that
is
the
law
and
my
judgment
and
i
can
rule
upon
--
and
i
can
only
rule
upon
as
i
see
it,
and
i
forbid
you
from
asking,
repeating
the
same
questions
over
and
over
again,
upon
which
i
have
ruled
specifically
100
times
that
it's
not
admissible
and
is
improper
under
this
issue.”
and
then,
there
was
a
pre-colloquy
between
mr.
freeman
and
the
court
in
which
mr.
freeman
elicited
from
the
court
the
assurance
that
this
ruling
applied
only
as
of
this
particular
deponent,
mr.
simpson,
under
these
particular
circumstances.
for
example,
at
the
bottom
of
page733,
the
court
says
“this
does
not
bar
you
from
making
an
offer
of
proof
in
the
absence
of
the
jury.”
by
mr.
freeman,
“i
assume
you
are
merely
barring
me
from
asking
questions
that
have
to
do
with
cross
and
simpson.”
by
the
court,
“the
same
repetitious
questions,
over
and
over
again,
i
am
not
barring
you
from
making
the
offer.
you
will
make
all
the
offer
you
want,
but
not
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
because
the
issue
before
them
is
limited.”
and
then,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
court
says
--
mr.
freeman
says
“we
think
conspiracy
and
the
fact
that
the
public
service
of
cross
was
destroyed
by
this
is
part
of
the
public
injury.”
by
the
court,
“that
is
what
you
think
and
make
your
offer
a
proof,
but
not
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
--
of
this
jury,”
and
then
mr.
freeman
asked
for
a
10-minute
recess,
which
was
granted.
and,
after
the
jury
had
departed
but
before
the
attorneys
and
the
court
broke
up,
the
court
said
to
mr.
mcconnell,
“mr.
mcconnell,
we
are
not
plain
to
the
galleries
here.
i
am
ruling
upon
rules
of
evidence
and
i
see
them,”
and
these
are
not
evidence.
by
mr.
mcconnell,
“i
am
not
plain
to
any
galleries.”
by
the
court,
“i
am
not
going
to
have
any
more
of
it.”
by
mr.
mcconnell,
“i
am
trying
to
try
a
law
suit.
i
am
being
prevented
from
trying
it
at
every
stage
of
it.”
by
the
court,
“it
doesn't
call
for
insults
or
abuse.”
by
mr.
mcconnell,
“i
am
not
making
any
insults.”
by
the
court,
“you
certainly
do
when
you
say
you
have
to
be
dragged
out
by
a
sheriff
in
stopping
you
from
making
the
proof.
i
will
stop
it.”
by
mr.
mcconnell,
“there
comes
a
time
when
a
lawyer
has
to
stand
up
and
state
his
client's
case.”
by
the
court,
“and,
as
a
gentleman
in
the
bounds
of
the
law.”
by
mr.
mcconnell,
“we
have
a
right
to
ask
these
questions.”
by
the
court,
“you
have
a
right
to
your
say,
but
i
have
ruled
against
it
and
you
may
make
your
record.”
mr
--
by
mr.
mcconnell,
“we
can't
make
the
record
without
asking
the
questions.
that
is
the
point.”
by
the
court
--
the
court
then
asked
mr.
freeman
whether
he
has
anything
to
say.
mr.
freeman
says
no
and
then,
after
the
recess,
mr.
freeman,
on
page
--
this
is
on
page
736
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
mr.
freeman
tells
the
court
“in
view
of
your
honor's
ruling,
i
will
not
continue
the
reading
of
the
deposition
of
mr.
simpson,
but
i
will
seek
to
cover
it
in
an
offer
of
proof
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,”
and
an
offer
of
proof
was
made
later
in
the
trial
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
as
--
not
only
as
to
mr.
simpson
but
as
to
all
the
witnesses,
in
respect
of
whom,
similar
rulings
were
made.
and,
if
the
court
would
turn
to
page
--
by
in
free
--
page
985,
is
the
place
where
these
offers
of
proof
are
begun
and
it
continues
for
40
or
50
pages.
and,
on
page
994
is
the
place
where
the
offer
of
proof
with
regard
to
mr.
simpson
is
made
and
that
continues
for
about
four
or
five
pages
without
any
limitation
whatever.
the
judge
permitted
counsel
to
make
any
offer
of
proof
he
chose
to.
now,
it
is
true
that
judge
miner,
in
his
memorandum
opinion
in
the
civil
case,
later
referred
to
the
fact
that
offers
of
proof
which
had
been
made
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
civil
case
were
inadequate
on
a
certain
point,
but
the
inadequacy
was
not
in
any
limitation
by
the
court
on
making
the
offer
of
proof
but
in
the
failure
to
--
in
the
failure
of
counsel
to
make
some
point
in
their
offer
of
proof.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
up
to
the
point,
beginning
with
that
--
with
remarks
about
plain
to
the
galleries,
do
you
recall
that?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
up
to
that,
it
was
in
the
presence
of
jury.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and,
those
remarks,
beginning
at
that
point,
was
in
a
recess
which
had
been
declared
where
the
jury
had
departed,
but
where
the
attorneys
were
still
present.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
now,
judge
duffy,
in
his
dissent,
says
he
agrees
that
the
statement,
the
allegedly
contemptuous
statement,
was
offensive
and
he
said
mr.
mcconnell
certainly
should
have
apologized
to
the
court
after
the
recess
but
if
--
but,
he
said
no
contempt
occurred
because
there
was
no
obstruction
of
justice.
and,
why
was
there
no
obstruction
of
justice?
because
the
petitioner
did
not
make
good
his
threat.
he
did
--
he
did
not
wait
for
a
bailiff
to
come
and
remove
him
from
the
court,
but
finally
exceeded
to
the
ruling.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
obstruction
of
the
administration
of
justice
is
not
limited
solely
to
some
spectacular
happening
in
the
court,
such
as
happened
in
ex
parte
terry
where
one
of
the
attorneys
physically
assaulted
a
court
official
and
had
to
be
escorted
from
the
court.
there
can
be
obstruction
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
an
insolent
remark
to
a
court,
an
expression
of
defiance,
or
any
form
--
really,
any
form
of
disrespect
and,
so
far
as
i
know,
that
proposition
has
never
been
questioned.
and,
in
any
event,
even
if
it
were
necessary
to
find
some
physical
or
overt
obstruction
here,
certainly,
it
can
be
found
in
fact
that
judge
miner
had
to
take
time
from
the
trial
of
the
case
to
administer
the
review.
now,
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
summary
procedure
was
proper,
as
distinguish
from
proceeding
by
notice
and
hearing
under
rule
42
(b),
it
is
the
government's
position
quite
simply
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
sacher
case.
now,
the
petitioner
reads
the
offutt
case,
which
was
decided
after
the
sacher,
as
somehow
impairing
the
questioning
eluding
the
authority
of
the
sacher
case.
we
do
not
so-read
the
offutt
decision.
we
read
the
offutt
decision
as
laying
down
a
special
qualification,
namely,
that
where
a
trial
judge
has
become
so
personally
and
emotionally
embroiled
in
the
conduct
of
the
accused
that
he
is
unable
to
bring
to
the
task
of
vindicating
the
authority
of
the
court,
a
sufficient
degree
of
judicial
detachment
to
enable
him
to
perform
that
function
in
a
judicial
manner
that
he
should
ask
the
chief
judge
of
the
court
to
assign
the
hearing
of
the
alleged
contempt
to
another
judge,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
judge
miner
throughout
the
two
weeks
of
this
very
vigorously
and,
at
times,
bitterly
contested
trial,
demeaned
himself
with
decorum
and
judicial
dignity
at
all
times
and,
for
that
reason,
it
seems
to
the
government
that
this
case
just
does
not
come
within
the
special
rule
of
the
offutt
case
at
all,
but
falls
within
the
general
principle
of
the
sacher
case,
namely,
that
a
judge
may,
without
losing
his
power
to
proceed
summarily,
defer
the
issuance
of
the
certificate
of
contempt
and
the
imposition
of
judgment
until
a
time
which,
in
his
discretion
and
in
his
judgment,
will
not
unduly
interfere
with
the
progress
of
the
trial.
in
the
course
of
which,
the
contempt
occurs,
and
that
is
precisely
what
hap
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
was
under
42
(a),
sir.
it
was,
under
42
(a),
a
summary
procedure
by
the
--
the
only
thing
was
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
just
as
in
sacher,
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
sacher,
sir.
so
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
is
correct,
sir.
the
judge
applied
the
rule
which
was
applied
in
ex
parte
terry,
namely,
that
the
judicial
eye
perceived
the
conduct,
the
judicial
mind
grasped
all
the
circumstances
of
provocation,
and
the
--
there
was
nothing
left
but
for
the
judicial
arm
to
impose
the
penalty.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
obstruction
to
the
court
basically,
mr.
justice
black,
was
the
defiance
of
the
authority
of
the
court
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
thereby
demeaning
the
authority
of
the
court
publicly.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
decisions,
as
i
read
them,
that
it
has
never
been
required
that
there'd
be
any
further
obstruction
of
justice
than
flows
from
that
--
those
circumstances
in
themselves.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
now,
for
--
for
example,
if
your
honor
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
for
example,
if
your
honor
will
recall
in
mcguinness
against
united
states
which
was
here
several
years
ago
on
petition
for
certiorari
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
mcguinness,
where
the
alleged
contempt
was
the
defense
counsel
saying
to
the
court
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
after
the
judge
had
asked
a
question
--
a
certain
question
of
a
defense
witness
that
the
defense
thought
was
objectionable,
defense
counsel
said
“your
honor
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
for
asking
such
a
question
and
should
cite
himself
for
contempt
for
doing
so.”
now,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
that
was
contemptuous
hearsay
on
its
face.
it
did
not
have
to
try
to
measure
any
degree
of
obstruction
of
justice
other
than
the
demeaning
of
the
authority
of
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
not
entirely,
if
it
were
necessary.
i
don't
--
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
necessary,
mr.
justice
black,
but
if
it
were
necessary
defying
some
overt,
some
physical
obstruction,
i
think
that
it
happened
here,
in
fact,
the
judge
had
to
interrupt
the
trial
in
order
to
administer
the
rebut,
which
he
did,
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
i
think
that
that
is
an
arguable
position,
mr.
justice
black,
but
i
think
that
has
been
foreclosed
by
the
sacher
decision
because,
certainly,
judge
medina
was
baited
and
insulted
in
that
case
far
more
than
happened
in
this
case
and
at
much
greater
length,
but
this
court
held
that
judge
medina
had
the
power
to
act
summarily
at
the
end
of
the
trial.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
do
you
have
any
in
particular
mind,
sir?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
offutt.
in
that
--
in
that
--
we
read
that
case
as
being
a
very
special
situation
where
the
judge
practically,
from
the
beginning
of
the
trial,
was
embroiled
in,
well,
either
the
court
or
one
of
the
opinions,
i
think,
yes,
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
said
it
was
an
intermittently
continuous
wrangling.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
would
say
that
if,
by
wrangling,
you
mean
something
of
the
nature
of
what
happened
in
the
offutt
case,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
did
not
go
on
at
all.
there
was
--
there
was
no
instance
of
that.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
i
think
not
--
i
think,
sir,
that
what
happened
even
in
this
incident
involved
in
this
specification
of
contempt
that
judge
miner
did
not
engage
in
any
wrangling
with
defense
--
with
plaintiff's
counsel,
but
he
handled
it
very
judiciously
and
very
ably
and
in
a
judicial
manner.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
do
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
the
petitioner
made
statements
which
the
trial
judge
and
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously,
with
reason,
found
overstepped
the
bounds
of
propriety
and
were
contemptuous.
now,
wrangling,
to
me,
connotes
that
it
has
to
be
two
parties
to
it.
so,
for
that
reason,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
wrangling
in
this
case.
for
the
reasons
which
i
have
--
which
i
have
stated,
we
think
that
the
court
should
adhere
to
its
sacher
decision
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
thank
you,
sir.
