mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
appearing
here
in
my
own
behalf,
being
the
petitioner
in
the
case,
and
the
matter
comes
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
which
affirmed
in
part
a
conviction
for
criminal
contempt
against
me
under
one
of
some
seven
specifications
that
was
entered
against
my
co-counsel
and
myself
in
a
case
that
was
tried
before
judge
julius
h.
miner
in
united
states
district
court
in
chicago.
two
citations
of
contempt
which
were
entered
by
judge
miner
against
me
were
reversed
as
a
matter
of
law
by
the
court
of
appeals.
you
know,
as
all
--
as
i
have
already
stated,
four
citations
against
mr.
lee
freeman,
who
was
my
co-counsel,
were
also
reversed
totally
because
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
part
of
the
specification
that
was
affirmed
as
against
me
is
described
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
follows.
i
won't
attempt
to
characterize
it.
i'll
read
what
they
say.
as
to
specification
6,
we
hold
that
with
the
exception
of
one
statement
attributed
to
respondent,
nothing
with
which
he
is
charged
has
been
supported
by
proof
of
contemptuousness
or
disrespect.
the
exception
in
specification
6
to
which
we
have
just
referred
charges
that
respondent
said,
“we
don't
have
a
right
to
read
the
answers
but
we
have
a
right
to
ask
the
questions
and
we
propose
to
do
so
unless
some
bailiff
stops
us.”
the
majority
opinion
held
that
this
constituted
contempt
and
judge
duffy
who,
former
chief
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit,
said
that,
in
his
opinion,
it
did
not
and
that
there
was
no
obstruction
to
the
administration
of
justice
required
by
the
statute,
and
that
he
would
reverse
as
to
that
specification,
as
well
as
the
other
two,
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
reversed.
now,
to
understand
the
context
and
the
background
in
which
these
remarks
were
made,
and
to
understand
the
issue
which
is
presented
for
review
here
in
this
court,
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
advert
briefly
to
the
case
that
was
being
tried.
i
represented
the
plaintiff,
the
parmelee
transportation
company
in
an
antitrust
suit
which
was
brought
against
six
railroads,
four
railroad
presidents,
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
hugh
w.
cross
who
is
former
chairman
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and,
it
was
alleged,
and
we
sought
to
prove,
that
mr.
cross,
as
chairman,
had
importuned
the
presidents
of
these
railroads
to
transfer
the
transfer
of
business
that
is
carrying
passengers
between
terminals
in
chicago
from
the
parmelee
company
which
had
enjoyed
the
business
for
some
102
years
to
a
company
to
be
formed
by
a
mr.
keeshin,
and
we
alleged
conspiracy
in
damages
and
our
complaint
was
tested
by
a
judge
who
is
now
dead,
calling
that
it
constituted,
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
good
complaint.
we
spent
three
years
taking
depositions
and
spent
thousands
and
thousands
of
dollars,
and
we
got
down
to
the
trial
of
the
case
and
judge
miner
called
us
all
in
and
he
said
he
had
decided.
no
motion
was
made
to
this
at
all,
that
he
was
going
to
try
an
issue
which
he
designated
as
the
issue
of
public
injury.
we'd
ask
for
a
jury
trial
on
all
issues
in
the
case
and
judge
miner
said,
“we're
not
going
to
try
anything
before
this
jury
except
the
issue
of
whether
the
public
has
been
injured
in
money
damages
by
the
shift
of
this
transfer
contract
from
the
parmelee
company
to
the
keeshin
company.”
i
took
the
position
before
judge
miner,
citing
this
court's
decisions
in
the
klor's
and
radovich
case,
that
that
was
not
an
issue
in
an
antitrust
case.
it
was
only
an
attempt
to
hedge
us
in
and
keep
us
from
trying
our
lawsuit.
and,
my
objections
were
overruled
and
that
court
said
we
will
proceed
to
trial
on
the
sole
issue
of
public
injury.
at
that
point,
i
offered
to
stipulate
with
opposing
counsel
as
to
offers
of
proof
which
i
would
make
on
the
issue
of
conspiracy
and
monopoly.
i
saw
right
away
that
we
we're
not
going
to
try
anything
of
an
antitrust
nature
in
the
case,
but
i
want
to
get
it
out
of
the
court
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
quickly
and
expeditiously
as
i
could,
and
i
offered
in
open
court
to
make
that
stipulation
and
opposing
counsel
said,
“no.
we
will
not
stipulate.
the
issue
must
be
tried
and
must
be
tried
before
the
jury
as
specified
by
judge
miner.”
although,
they
themselves
took
that
the
position
that
that
was
not
a
proper
issue
in
the
case.
in
that
situation,
we
attempted
to
make
offers
of
proof
and
there's
a
rule
--
better
rule
of
civil
procedure
43
(c),
a
rule
promulgated
by
this
court
under
the
directions
and
the
authority
of
the
congress,
which
provides
how
offers
of
proof
can
be
made.
and,
it
provides
that,
in
order
to
make
an
offer
of
proof
--
a
proper
offer
of
proof
in
a
case
before
a
jury,
you
must
put
a
witness
on
the
stand
or
at
least
if
you're
reading
a
deposition,
you
must
read
the
question
that
was
asked
to
the
witness.
and
then,
when
the
court
rules,
whether
or
not
it's
a
proper
question,
then
you
can
read
the
answer
if
it's
a
deposition
or
you
can
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
you
can
make
your
offer
of
proof.
now,
there
was
never
any
question
in
the
case
that
that's
the
proper
way
to
proceed,
at
least
otherwise,
there
was
never
any
such
question.
judge
miner
--
first,
we
attempted
to
proceed
in
a
different
way
to
shorten
the
thing
up
and
counsel
said
“we
are
not
going
to
stood
--
sit
here
or
sit
by
and
permit
for
one
moment
any
offers
of
proof
which
are
not
made
in
exact
accordance
with
rule
40
(c)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,”
and
we
went
along
making
rule
--
making
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
page
598
of
the
transcript
of
proceedings.
mr.
thompson,
he's
our
chief
counsel,
"we
are
not
going
to
wait
until
he
finishes
the
offer.
we
are
not
going
to
sit
still
for
one
moment
and
have
an
offer
of
proof
made
that
is
directed
to
a
question
be
--
pending
before
a
witness
who
is
not
on
the
stand,
who
is
on
the
stand
because
that's
exactly
what
the
rule
says,
and
we
will
undertake
to
try
this
according
to
the
rule,”
and
he
was
referring
to
rule
43
(c).
alright,
we
went
along
for
a
while
asking
the
questions,
and
the
court
from
time
to
time
made
the
observation
that
he
was
not
going
to
hear
or
permit
the
jury
to
hear
anything
concerning
mr.
cross.
mr.
cross
was
the
defendant
in
the
case
and
we've
taken
depositions
of
him.
and
then,
we
got
down
to
taking
a
depos
--
reading
the
deposition
of
mr.
howard
simpson,
who
is
president
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
and
mr.
freeman,
my
co-counsel,
was
attempting
to
ask
--
read
the
questions
which
had
been
asked
of
mr.
simpson
on
his
deposition,
and
the
court
stopped
him.
and,
the
court
said,
"we
are
not
going
to
have
anymore
reading
of
these
questions"
and
that
was
on
the
face
of
the
objection
of
counsel
that
that
was
the
only
way
it
could
be
done,
and
mr.
freeman
said
"i
am
in
the
uncomfortable
position,"
and
i'm
paraphrasing
the
words,
"of
having
counsel
telling
me
to
have
to
do
it
according
to
form
as
prescribed
by
the
rule
and
your
honor
telling
me
that
i
can't
proceed
that
way."
and,
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding,
i
was
sitting
there
in
the
courtroom,
not
conducting
this
reading.
i
entered
the
discussion
and
i
told
the
judge
that
we
had
to
ask
the
questions
because
that
was
the
only
way
we
could
make
our
proof.
and,
there
was
further
colloquy
and
the
judge
finally
indicated
that
he
was
not
letting
us
proceed
and
i
made
the
statements
which
i
did
in
the
heat
of
the
situation
in
which
we
were
involved.
and
then,
we
had
a
recess.
and
then,
after
the
recess,
we
came
back
and
decided.
we've
done
everything
that
a
lawyer
can
do
to
make
his
record
and
we
said
that
we
would
hear
to
the
court's
ruling.
now,
there
are
two,
or
possibly
three,
fundamental
and
controlling
considerations
which
are
raised
by
this
issue.
in
the
first
place,
we
did
not
pursue
those
offers
of
proof
so
far
as
mr.
cross'
participation
in
that
conspiracy
was
concerned,
at
least
not
with
that
witness.
and,
the
deposition
showed
that
there
have
been
talks
where
mr.
cross
had
importuned
him
to
use
his
influence
to
bring
these
railroads
together
to
exclude
us
here.
well,
we
had
the
trial
on
the
error
of
an
issue,
which
signified
nothing
because
there
was
no
issue
permitted
to
be
tried.
we
weren't
permitted
to
introduce
any
offer
of
conspiracy
or
any
evidence
of
conspiracy
or
monopoly.
the
jury
found
that
there
was
no
money
damages
under
the
instructions
which
were
given.
it
was
practically
a
directed
verdict,
and
then
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
trial
and
the
court
said,
"i'm
going
to
write
an
opinion
and
i'm
going
to
hold
that
there
isn't
--
this
doesn't
fall
within
the
family
of
antitrust
that
the
complaint
doesn't
state
a
cause
of
action."
and
then
he
went
on
and
said
this,
"the
offers
of
proof
upon
which
the
plaintiff
--
the
proofs
upon
which
the
plaintiffs
apparently
were
going
to
rely,
the
allegations
of
cross'
intervention
in
this
situation
are
not
supported
by
the
offers
of
proof.”
and,
the
reason
i
most
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
they
weren't
supported
by
the
offers
of
proof.
if
they
weren't,
i
don't
think
that's
a
correct
statement,
i
think
they
were,
but
assuming
arguendo
that
they
were
not,
we
couldn't
make
them
and
we
couldn't
make
them
in
compliance
with
the
rule
because
we
were
precluded.
further,
when
we
got
up
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
appeal
in
the
parmelee
case,
the
court
of
appeals
passed
by
the
fact,
judge
duffy
mentioned
it
in
his
dissent,
the
fact
that
we'd
had
no
trial
on
any
issue
that
was
relevant
to
an
antitrust
case.
and,
as
a
make
way,
the
court
below
had
dismissed
the
complaint
after
another
judge
had
held
it
was
valid
and
then
made
his
remarks
about
the
offers
of
proof,
but
the
upper
court
said
that
its
analysis
of
the
offers
of
proof
led
it
to
believe
that
this
didn't
constitute
a
valid
antitrust
case,
even
though
this
case
had
held
--
this
court
had
held
in
the
in
the
other
cases,
a
conspiracy
affecting
this
very
branch
of
commerce
violated
the
antitrust
law.
so,
the
case
was
dismissed.
now,
the
point
i'm
making
and
leading
up
to
is
counsel
who
has
exceeded
and
who
has
met
the
requirements
of
a
judge
to
stop,
his
client
is
utterly
prejudiced
in
appeal.
his
record
is
not
complete
and
will
be
faced
with
a
situation
which
was
referred
to
by
mr.
--
the
late
mr.
justice
rutledge
in
the
mineworkers
case
where
he
said,
"if
you
reach
a
situation
where
obedience
means
the
loss
of
the
rights
--
the
substantive
rights,
compliance
means
the
loss
of
a
substantive
right,
you're
in
a
situation
where
no
court
should
declare
that
criminal.”
now,
we
are
relying
here,
i
am
relying
here,
upon
the
limitations,
upon
the
inherent
power
of
a
court
to
punish
for
contempt
which
are
contained
in
u.s.
code
section
401,
sections
1
and
3.
this
court
has
held
that,
in
a
number
of
cases,
that
that
is
the
congressional
limitation
upon
the
power
of
the
federal
district
courts
to
punish
for
contempt,
and
they've
also
held
--
this
court
has
also
held
that
there
must
be
shown
two
things.
no,
i
regard
that
statement.
this
court
has
held
in
the
hudgings
case
that
there
must
be
shown
an
obstruction
to
justice
as
a
condition
preceding
to
a
proper
exercise
of
the
power
of
contempt.
section
3
of
that
statute
provides
that
it
must
be
shown
that
there
is
disobedience
to
a
lawful
order
to
constitute
contempt
punishable
by
a
court.
now,
my
first
position
is
that
judge
miner's
order
or
direction
abrogated
rule
43
(c),
promulgated
by
this
court
under
the
directions
of
the
congress,
was
not
a
lawful
order
and,
while
i
didn't
disobey
it,
still
it
posed
a
situation
where
i
was
entitled
to
go
as
far
as
i
could
go
to
show
an
unequivocal
refusal
by
the
court
to
let
me
proceed
in
accordance
with
the
rule.
as
i
say,
after
the
recess,
we
told
the
court
we
would
ask
no
further
questions
regarding
the
incident
or
regarding
the
depositions.
now,
is
it
a
lawful
order
that
abrogates
a
rule
of
court
promulgated
by
the
congress
--
promulgated
by
this
court
under
the
authority
of
the
congress?
and,
i
find
no
case
and
the
government
cites
no
case
which
holds
that
that
is
a
lawful
order.
certainly,
it's
a
case
of
first
impression
here.
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
abrogation
of
a
rule
which
is
reenact
of
congress
and
which
the
lower
courts,
the
courts
of
appeal
has
said
is
binding
upon
the
court,
is
binding
upon
the
litigant,
is
binding
upon
the
lawyers.
the
abrogation
of
such
a
rule
is
a
lawful
order.
now,
judge
miner,
himself,
later
in
this
case
--
can
you
get
the
conjunction
statement
he
made?
he
said,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
935
of
the
record.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
it's
volume
3.
where
the
court,
later,
was
addressing
my
opposing
counsel,
the
late
judge
thompson,
the
court,
“i
am
saying
most
respectfully,
only
in
this
sense,
judge
thompson,
and
believe
me
it
is
respectful,
i
don't
know
what
you
are
to
stipulate
or
what
you
decline
to
stipulate
except
for
one
thing
that
i
do
know.
that,
in
the
absence
of
a
stipulation,
the
cases,
as
i
read
them,
require
the
presenting
of
a
witness,
ask
him
some
questions
and,
when
i
declined
to
let
him
answer,
then
they
can
proceed
with
the
offer
of
proof.
by
mr.
thompson,
“there
isn't
any
question
about
that.
all
of
us
agreed
with
that.”
now,
that
was
the
very
thing
i
was
trying
to
do,
and
the
very
thing
that
i
was
prevented
from
doing
to
the
obvious
prejudice
of
my
client
in
the
review
of
the
case.
we've
got
no
trial.
we
tried
no
antitrust
issue.
we
never
were
allowed
a
trial
anywhere
along
the
line.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
i
have
any
right
to
do
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
if
it
was
assumed
that
it
was
unlawful,
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
but,
i
don't
think
that
court
sort
of
an
order
would
be
unlawful
under
the
rule
because,
there,
i
have
the
record
and
chance
to
make
the
record.
he
says
i
can't
ask
the
question.
that's
what
i
called
--
told
judge
miner.
i
said
you
have
a
right
to
sustain
an
objection
to
the
question.
i
told
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
not
at
all.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
my
theory
is
that,
if
the
order
which
he
enters
is
not
just
an
erroneous
order,
not
just
an
erroneous
ruling
on
the
question
of
evidence
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
not
very
--
not
a
degree
of
erroneousness,
but
where
a
rule
is
promulgated,
where
he
is
supposedly
bound
by
that
rule
himself
and
he
sets
that
rule
aside
over
the
objection
of
all
counsel,
of
counsel
on
the
other
side,
where
i
can't
make
a
record
because
the
rule
says
how
i
can
make
the
offer.
i
say,
in
that
situation,
there's
nothing
for
me
to
do
except
to
stand
and
go
as
far
as
i
can
go
to
make
a
record.
in
this
case,
i
didn't
make
a
record.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
it
differs
from
your
case
because
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
in
your
hypothetical
case,
i
could
still
make
the
record
on
review
because
if
i'm
refused
--
if
i
am
erroneously
refused
the
opportunity
of
asking
a
question,
i
can
assign
error
on
that
and
i
--
but
how
can
i
assign
error
on
an
offer
of
proof
which
wasn't
made
and
the
upper
court
says,
it
isn't
in
the
record
so
it
doesn't
consider.
one
is
a
situation
where
the
court
is
dealing
erroneously
with
the
situation.
another
is
where
he
is
dealing
with
it
in
a
way
where
he
ignores
the
rule
which
is
supposed
to
be
binding
on
him
as
a
public
counsel.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
know
but
they
are
--
they
give
room
for
difference
of
--
or
there
can
be
an
error
of
it,
one
way
another,
but
where
it
cuts
down
--
cuts
away
the
very
fundamental
rules
of
your
rights
in
the
court.
now,
let
me
put
this
to
your
honor.
the
majority
opinion
says
here
that
i
had
a
right,
and
i'm
not
saying
this
in
any
argumentative
way,
i'm
just
saying
what
the
court
says,
that
i
had
a
right
to
be
in
that
court
and
ask
questions
and
make
offers
of
proof.
and
they
didn't
say
it,
but
the
inference
was
clear
that
it
was
part
of
the
machinery
of
trying
lawsuits
for
the
machinery
of
justice,
and
that
i
had
a
right
to
make
an
offer
of
proof.
they
say
that
without
any
equivocation
whatever.
now,
if
i
had
a
right
to
make
an
offer
of
proof,
i
most
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
i
had
a
right
to
make
it
in
a
way
that
made
sense
on
appeal,
and
i
had
a
right
to
make
it
in
a
way
which
corresponded
with
the
rules
of
this
court.
and,
in
correspondence,
in
a
sense,
where
the
statute
is
laid
down
by
the
congress
because
the
congress
told
this
court,
through
a
commission,
to
write
these
rules,
which
was
done.
now,
if
i
had
a
right
to
appear
there,
if
i
had
a
right
to
make
an
offer
of
proof,
the
question
i
submit
to
this
court
is
why
didn't
i
have
a
right
to
make
it
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
this
court?
now,
it
can
be
made
to
appear
here
that
my
action
was
antagonistic
to
the
court
as
such,
it
was
not.
i
was
trying,
in
the
only
way
that
i
knew,
in
the
heat
of
a
highly
contested
trial
involving
millions
of
dollars
to
make
a
record.
i
knew
i
wasn't
going
anywhere
in
the
trial.
my
only
chance
was
to
make
a
record
in
the
appeal
and
i
was
being
thwarted,
as
judge
duffy
says
at
every
turn,
and
every
time
i
try
to
make
an
offer
of
proof
and
the
judge
would
change
his
opinion
and
change
his
ruling,
and
that
was
the
situation.
now,
further
than
that,
of
course
the
question,
whether
i
was
trying
to
deal
with
it
in
good
faith,
trying
to
represent
a
client
and
nothing
more,
that
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
do,
and
that's
one
of
the
six
questions
that,
i
submit,
shouldn't
have
been
determined
by
judge
miner.
it
should
have
been
determined
by
somebody
else.
if
he
wasn't
intimately
involved,
we
had
seven
specifications
of
contempt
here,
six
of
them
knocked
out
as
a
matter
of
law.
and,
further,
the
whole
basis
of
that
thing,
as
this
court
said
in
the
radiant
burners
case,
was
an
absolutely
irrelevant
issue.
it
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
an
antitrust
suit.
now,
the
next
question
was
whether
or
not
there
was
any
obstruction
to
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
government
seems
to
say
--
well,
the
government
seems
to
say
two
things
in
their
brief.
first,
that
any
opposition
to
a
court's
order
is
per
se
contemptuous.
well,
i
realize
that
courts
had
to
be
wrong
and
i
realize
that
the
judges
have
to
run
them,
but
i
most
humbly
submit
that
the
public
and
litigants
have
very
fundamental
rights
in
having
counsel
who
are
independent
enough
and
have
enough
latitude
to
properly
present
their
cases.
certainly,
they
ought
to
have
enough
latitude
so
that
they
can
present
a
case
in
accordance
with
rules
promulgated
by
this
very
court.
and,
if
that's
contemptuous,
i
guess
it's
contemptuous.
i
don't
know
anything
else
to
say
about
it,
except
that
i
was
trying
the
best
i
could
in
a
very
difficult
situation
to
assert
some
rights
and
i
didn't
succeed
very
well.
judge
duffy
saw
the
point.
he
saw
there
was
no
obstruction
to
justice.
the
government
here
says
that
anything
that
shows
a
conflict
between
a
counsel
and
a
court
would
tend
to
bring
disrespect
to
the
court.
on
the
contrary,
i
think
the
lay
public
has
more
respect
for
a
judicial
process
which
gives
latitude
to
a
trial
counsel
to
properly
represent
a
client's
right
than
it
does
to
us
observing,
lawyer-counsel,
or
a
bar.
and,
that's
what's
really
involved
here.
the
question
of
my
client
of
a
hundred
dollars
means
this
trivia
with
the
question
of
latitude
to
trial
counsel
in
important
litigations
such
as
this
where
he's
not
permitted
to
try
anything,
something
that
i
think,
serve
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
--
contention
of
this
court.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
it's
been
a
member
for
37
years.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
can't
answer
that.
it
might.
it
might
have
serious
consequences.
i
don't
think
so,
but
it
might.
i've
been
a
member
in
good
standing
there
and
nobody
there
ever
accused
me
of
anything
so
far
as
i
know,
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
he
did
--
he
did
and
judge
duffy
refers
to
that
and
says
that
"my
objection
bore
fruit,"
that
it
did
result
in
such,
but
i
never
got
back
to
these
questions.
i
never
went
back
to
those.
i
never
got
into
the
record
to
think
that
i
was
trying
to
offer
and
which
the
upper
court
assumes
quite
essential
to
my
case.
the
participation
of
this
man,
cross,
a
high
government
official,
and
importuning
these
railroads
to
take
business
from
one
person
and
take
it
to
another,
never
a
chance
to
try
that
issue.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
it
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
that
issue,
your
honor,
but
i
took
the
position
that
that
irrelevant
issue
prevented
me
from
introducing
the
evidence
of
conspiracy
and
monopoly
which
i
had
alleged
and
sought
to
prove,
and
the
only
way
i
could
make
a
record
for
review
up
above
was
to
show
that
i
had
the
evidence
of
conspiracy
and
monopoly
which,
if
i
had
been
permitted
to
show
it,
it
would
have
resulted
in
a
prima
facie
case
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
we
couldn't
try
any
conspiracy
issue
unless
we
won
the
irrelevant
issues.
that
was
a
condition
that
precedes
to
trying
any
other
issue
in
an
antitrust
case,
and
i
don't
just
say
that
it's
erroneous.
this
court
says
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
it's
erroneous
in
the
radiant
burners
case
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
--
and
said
it's
specific,
and
the
per
curiae
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
not
a
thing
to
do
with
that
issue.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
said
that
was
irrelevant.
i
didn't
see
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
case.
i
was
willing
to
stipulate
that
he
could
do
anything
he
wanted
to
with
it,
direct
a
verdict
on
it.
i
wanted
to
get
up
to
the
upper
court
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
--
on
that
issue.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
do.
alright,
so
we
get
down
to
the
question
of
obstruction
of
justice
and
justice
duffy
--
or
judge
duffy
said
that
he
could
see
no
obstruction
to
justice.
and,
under
this
statute,
judge
--
under
this
statute,
it's
a
limitation
if
it's
anything
and
we're
left
in
this
situation
doing
that,
if
any
order
--
if
any
order
that
a
judge
enters
from
the
trial
of
a
case
or
otherwise
is
lawful
per
se,
and
it's
just
lawful,
why,
of
course
this
limitation
in
the
statute
that
must
be
lawful
has
no
meaning
whatever
because
there's
no
objective
standard
at
all
to
measure
the
judge's
order.
it's
just
lawful
if
he
enters
it,
and
that's
that
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
now,
the
second
limitation
was
that
no
obstruction
of
justice
and
the
majority
court
found,
in
dealing
with
this
specification
6,
that
the
court
made
no
finding
of
obstruction
to
justice.
judge
miner
did.
and,
they
said
“we
don't
base
our
decision
on
that,”
but
we
conclude
from
that
that
if
there
was
no
such
finding,
then
the
record
doesn't
support
any
such
finding,
and
they
made
that
observation
with
reference
to
this
specification
6.
now,
there's
one
further
point
and
then
i'm
through.
in
this
situation,
judge
miner
stated
that
he
regards
this
as
a
direct
attack
upon
himself
and
he
also
stated
that
there
was
no
emergency
about
it.
i
had
business
in
london
and
i
had
to
go
to
europe
to
attend
to
it,
and
i
told
him
that.
he
said
there's
no
emergency
about
it,
put
it
over,
and
we
put
it
over
until
june
or
sometime
ago.
then,
he
went
over
into
a
fault.
there
was
no
emergency.
there
was
nothing.
the
case
went
on,
the
trial
went
on,
the
record
was
made,
but
judge
miner
apparently
indicated
that
he
thought
this
was
my
direct
attack
upon
himself,
which
it
wasn't.
and,
if
there
was
an
issue
of
fact
involved
in
that,
i
submit
most
humbly
to
this
court
that
the
bar
should
have
some
of
the
rights
of
the
bill
of
rights,
that
is,
they're
dealt
with
summarily
here.
and,
whether
or
not
they're
acting
in
good
faith
as
lawyers,
as
members
of
the
bar,
whether
or
not
they're
trying
to
protect
client's
rights
in
the
only
way
they
know
how
to
do,
whether
or
not
they
might
make
some
error
inadvertently
or
because
they
don't
know
anything
else
to
do,
as
it
might
be
the
call
of
the
situation
here,
that
is
a
question
which
goes
to
intent
and,
it
seems
to
me,
i
was
entitled
to
have
some
independent
judge
who
wasn't
involved
in
the
controversy
here.
that
was
refused
and
the
judge
who
heard
it
on
seven
specifications,
only
part
of
one
was
sustained.
now,
that
itself
is
significant.
i
submit
that
this
should
be
reversed,
not
for
my
benefit
particularly
but
for
the
bar.
