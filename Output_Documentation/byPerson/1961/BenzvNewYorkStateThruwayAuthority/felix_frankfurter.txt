justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
take
two
minutes
of
your
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
makes
such
comment
as
you
will.
forgive
me
to
my
procedural
of
jurisdictional
difficulty.
i'm
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
amended
the
remittitur.
it
says
they
passed
on
a
question
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i'm
also
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
said
that
not
even
the
court
of
appeals
or
any
other
state
court
can
amend
its
remittitur
and
inject
the
question
into
a
litigation
which
wasn't
before
the
court.
i
find
nothing
in
either
opinion
of
the
court
or
the
dissenting
opinion
which
deals
with
anything
except
the
power
or
except
the
statutory
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
new
york
law
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims.
the
greatest
difficulty
saying
that
simply
because
counsel
persuaded
or
the
chief
judge
of
new
york
court
of
appeals
whom
i
greatly
respect
said,
“oh
yes,
that
will
inject
the
fourteenth
amendment
problem
that
we
can
take
it
even
that
wasn't
an
issue
at
all,
if
new
york
chooses
not
to
confer
that
jurisdiction
upon
the
court
of
claims,
that
is
its
business.”
and
you're
right,
so
aren't
they
protected
by
going
to
the
federal
courts
if
you
haven't
got
any
redressed
or
taking
a
property
without
compensation
under
new
york
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
new
york
chooses
not
to
have
courts
which
entertain
these
claims,
this
court
can
confer
that
jurisdiction
by
saying
you
have
a
federal
right,
the
federal
constitution
amply
enforceable
in
federal
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
be
right.
all
i
--
all
i
--
all
i
like
i
get
it
is
from
two
written
opinions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
do
not
suggest
remotely
that
you
have
no
--
that
no
property
was
taken
here.
they
go
entirely
on
a
jurisdictional
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
i
haven't
looked
at
the
briefs,
is
the
distinction
of
the
court
of
claims
set
forth
in
statute
giving
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
also
--
you
also
got
--
this
isn't
merely
an
equity
suit,
is
it?
is
it
exclusively
equity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
want
money
damages?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
you
could
go
--
it
could
go
into
the
court
of
claims
and
ask
for
the
money,
couldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
but
as
to
moneys,
as
to
moneys,
that
you
get
your
money
from
the
court
of
claims?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rachlin,
am
i
right
in
--
in
reading
judge
van
voorhis
who
went
with
you,
who
wrote
the
dissenting
opinion
that
there
is
no
suggestion
in
his
opinion
about
constitutionality.
all
he
says
is
that
the
existing
jurisdictional
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
the
power
conferred
on
the
laws
of
your
state
do
give
the
courts
of
new
york
jurisdiction
and
chief
judge
desmond
the
contrary.
is
there
a
breath,
is
there
a
whisper
that
either
of
them
were
dealing
with
the
constitutional
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
didn't.
all
i'm
saying
--
i'm
not
against
you
or
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
contest
your
--
your
constitutional
claim
with
just
compensation.
i'm
suggesting
so
far
as
i
can
see
this
case,
it's
a
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals
against
the
strong
dissent
that
no
court
exists
in
new
york
which
deal
with
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there
were
no
new
york
court
to
which
you
would
go
to.
you
go
to
the
--
the
district
court
of
the
western
district
of
new
york
up
in
buffalo,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
be
right
as
a
matter
of
intellectual
analysis
of
the
new
york
situation
but
the
authoritative
body
for
determining
that
says
you're
wrong
namely
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
be
your
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
surely
what
you've
just
said
--
what
you've
just
said
you
asked
this
court
to
tell
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
that
they
were
wrong
in
their
reading
of
the
new
york
court
constitution
and
the
judiciary
act,
whatever
it
may
be
called
that
there
is
jurisdiction
when
they
said
there
isn't.
and
i
suppose
that
that's
one
thing
we
can't
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
saying
now
that
the
supreme
court
says
that
the
deprivation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
just
compensation
is
being
denied.
take
another
look
at
the
new
york
constitution
and
the
judiciary
act
of
new
york
and
(inaudible)
to
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
you
think
that's
not
a
state
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
was
the
respondent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
south?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
south
carolina.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
we
can
tell
--
we
can
decide
that
the
state
department,
department
of
government
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
not
--
is
not
part
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
york,
can
we?
