ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
civil
action
brought
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
which
the
petitioner
seeks
to
reform
for
an
alternative
rescind
and
agreement
entered
into
between
her
and
the
respondent
and
the
ground
of
the
fraud
of
the
respondent
or
a
mutual
mistake
of
facts.
respondent
appeared
especially
and
moved
to
dismiss
petitioner's
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction
over
the
person
of
the
respondent
and
the
subject
matter.
a
new
york
special
term
judge
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
of
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
the
appellate
division
affirmed
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
a
four
to
three
decisions
affirmed
on
the
grounds
that
the
respondent
was
immune
from
the
suit.
subsequent
to
the
decision,
the
remittitur
was
amended
to
show
that
upon
the
appeal
that
was
presented
and
necessarily
passed
upon
a
question
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
with
but
their
plaintiff
was
deprived
of
just
compensation
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
held
there
was
no
such
deprivation
or
violation.
the
united
state
supreme
court
granted
certiorari.
the
petitioner
now
seeks
to
have
this
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
to
the
new
york
supreme
court
for
trial
on
the
merits.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
most
important.
petitioner
and
her
husband
are
elderly
town's
people
living
in
town
--
in
the
village
of
hamburg
outside
of
buffalo,
new
york.
petitioner
owned
a
large
track
of
land
outside
of
buffalo
fronting
on
a
main
highway
that
she
had
received
by
inheritance.
the
new
york
state
thruway
authority,
the
respondent,
under
its
power
of
eminent
domain
appropriated
a
strip
of
land
through
this
track
which
effectively
bisected
the
track
of
land
and
making
--
and
made
the
rear
portion
of
the
track
which
was
in
fact
the
major
portion
of
the
track
completely
inaccessible.
under
the
new
york
appropriation
method,
title
passed
immediately
upon
the
filing
of
the
maps.
the
respondent,
thruway
authority,
employs
agents
whose
job
it
is
to
go
around
to
these
persons
whose
land
has
been
appropriated
to
get
what
they
called
agreements
of
adjustment
with
them
whereby
they
attempt
to
agree
on
a
price
to
be
paid
for
the
property.
one
of
these
agents
came
to
the
petitioner.
and
after
much
negotiation,
it
was
agreed
that
the
price
which
was
to
be
paid
would
be
$3500
in
cash
plus
90%
of
the
value
of
the
rear
track
of
land
which
had
been
rendered
practically
useless
by
this
appropriation,
plus
the
cost
of
the
purchase
of
an
excess
route
which
would
allow
you
at
least
to
obtain
access
to
backtrack.
now,
the
agreement
was
entered
into.
and
this
agreement
recites
only
the
sum
of
$3500
and
purports
to
be
in
full
compensation
for
the
land
which
was
taken.
the
agent,
however,
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
contract
stated
that
the
$3500
which
was
expressed
in
the
agreement
was
only
part
of
the
compensation
which
was
to
be
paid.
now,
we
have
alleged
in
our
complaint
and
the
allegation
must
be
accepted
as
true
for
the
purpose
of
this
proceeding,
that
$3500
represented
but
at
one-twentieth
of
the
value
of
this
property
which
was
taken
and
that
the
petitioner
has
in
fact
been
deprived
of
the
sum
of
$70,000
by
this
action
on
the
part
of
the
state.
and
as
we
say,
that
is
a
premise
we
must
be
taken.
though
subsequent
to
the
execution
of
this
agreement,
petitioner
sought
to
obtain
the
money
which
she
felt
was
coming
to
her.
these
representations
were
repeatedly
--
repeated
by
the
representatives
of
the
state
and
petitioner,
being
an
elderly
person
as
i've
said,
relied
upon
these
representations
made
by
the
representatives
of
the
state
and
she
consistently
refused
to
accept
the
$3500
check
which
was
offered.
and
finally,
she
consulted
her
attorney
and
found
the
true
nature
of
the
agreement
and
action
was
promptly
brought
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
rescind
or
reform
this
agreement,
to
show
the
true
nature
of
the
agreement
or
what
petitioner
felt
that
the
agreement
that
has
been
made.
the
defendant
respondent
appeared
in
the
proceeding,
especially
claims
sovereign
immunity
and
this
claim
has
been
consistently
upheld
throughout
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
petitioner's
contentions
are
very
basic.
one,
just
compensation
is
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
a
person
whose
properly
is
taken
for
public
use.
secondly,
a
state
cannot
interpose
sovereign
immunity
as
a
defense
to
a
claim
arising
out
of
a
taking
without
payment
of
just
compensation.
and
thirdly,
that
even
if
a
state
were
so
immune,
it
could
not
and
it
cannot
delegate
this
immunity
to
a
public
corporation.
now,
as
to
our
first
contention,
it
is
clear
the
just
compensation
has
been
denied
the
petitioner.
it
has
been
said
that
the
taking
of
property
for
public
use
without
payment
is
tyranny.
it
is
therefore
been
a
requirement
from
the
beginning
of
this
nation,
from
constitution
that
just
compensation
be
paid
and
as
for
the
federal
government,
this
was
embodied
in
the
fifth
amendment.
as
to
the
states,
it
was
clearly
held
that
it
was
embodied
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
just
compensation
has
been
defined
as
the
full
and
perfect
equivalent
for
property
taken
and
that
must
be
fixed
either
by
agreement
or
by
judicial
inquiry.
now,
petitioner's
compensation
was
fixed
by
neither.
there
was
no
more
of
an
agreement
here
than
if
the
gun
had
been
placed
to
the
petitioner's
head
and
she
had
been
directed
to
sign
this
alleged
agreement
for
the
courts
recognized
little
difference
between
fraud
and
duress.
there
was
no
meeting
of
the
minds.
we
have
alleged
and
it
must
be
accepted
as
true
a
mutual
mistake.
the
paper
that
was
written
did
not
express
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
therefore,
there
is
no
agreed
upon
compensations.
petitioner,
therefore,
has
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
yes
sir.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
yeah,
yes
sir
i
perhaps
use
the
term
meeting
of
the
minds
loosely.
there
was
no
meeting
of
the
minds
expressed
by
this
contract.
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
minds
we
contend
but
it
was
not
set
forth
in
this
contract.
that's
right,
sir.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
sure.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
our
contention
from
the
very
beginning
was
that
if
the
state
court
refused
to
accept
jurisdiction
of
this
case
that
such
refusal
to
accept
jurisdiction
and
refusal
thereby
to
give
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
of
a
just
compensation
which
he
was
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
then
constitute
a
deprivation
of
property
without
just
compensation
and
therefore,
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
the
fact
is
that
the
new
york
courts
--
let's
say
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
benz
case,
and
in
fact
constitutionally
under
the
new
york
state
constitution
have
established
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
as
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
law
and
equity.
by
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
under
the
strang
case
and
the
pantess
case,
it
was
specifically
so
held
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
had
jurisdiction,
full
jurisdiction
over
this
--
this
authority.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
well
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
well
the
--
this
was
of
course
--
our
contention
from
the
very
first
of
this
--
in
this
case.
we
established,
as
i've
said,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
--
by
this
agreement
which
was
--
as
i
say
either
mistakenly
drafted
or
fraudulently
drafted,
there
was
a
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process
of
law.
now,
we
say
that
the
--
that
sovereign
immunity
is
no
defense
to
a
taking
by
a
state
under
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
the
respondent
conceded
this
point
but
states
that
petitioner's
action
to
rescind
or
reform
the
agreement,
fixing
the
price
does
not
constitute
an
act
of
--
does
not
involve
an
act
of
eminent
domain.
they
contend
that
the
subject
matter
was
irrelevant.
but
the
subject
matter
is
very
important
and
because
petitioner's
basic
claim
here
is
for
just
compensation.
the
subject
matter
of
the
land
is
--
the
subject
matter
of
the
agreement
is
land
which
was
appropriate.
no
provision
is
made
for
compensation
at
the
time
of
the
appropriation.
now,
if
there
were
nothing
else,
you
would
of
course
have
to
strike
down
the
compen
--
the
statute
which
provides
for
the
appropriation.
the
statute
does
provide,
however,
for
either
determination
by
the
court
of
claims
or
in
the
alternative
an
agreement
of
adjustment.
compensation
is
then
fraudulently
determined
or
as
we
say
properly
determined
and
mistakenly
set
forth
in
the
agreement.
the
agreement,
therefore,
does
not
provide
for
just
compensation.
now,
you
come
to
the
second
deprivation.
the
state
court
refuses
jurisdiction
to
rescind
or
reform
the
agreement.
and
therefore,
we
have
two
state
instrumentalities
which
are
parti
--
participating
in
this
deprivation
of
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
one
is
the
fraudulent
agent
under
the
cost
of
action
based
on
fraud.
the
second
is
the
state
court's
refusal
to
hear
the
case
on
the
ground
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
state
court
action
has
been
held
as
we
know
of
to
constitute
state
action.
that's
the
mccoy
case
which
we
cite
in
page
16
of
our
replied
brief.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
set
forth.
the
jurisdiction
--
the
court
of
claims
sir
has
no
jurisdiction
in
equity
which
i
assume
that
would
be
your
question,
has
no
equitable
jurisdiction
whatever.
there
was
presently
a
statute
pending
in
the
new
york
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
i
--
yes.
it
contains
a
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
we
would
rely
on
the
clean-up
doctrine,
the
--
the
traditional
power
of
the
court
of
equity
to
grant
damages.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
no
sir,
we
clearly
cannot
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
--
the
court
of
appeals
has
in
fact
so
held
in
this
case.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
because
once
having
executed
our
agreement
of
adjustment,
we
were
then
foreclosed
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
--
not
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
claims
has
no
equitable
jurisdiction
and
can
do
nothing
about
this.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
no
sir.
the
--
again,
i
feel
that
here
were
foreclosed
by
the
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
i
would
imagine
so
but
i
don't
think
--
i
feel
that
once
having
executed
this
agreement
of
adjustment,
we
are
then
--
the
statute
being
in
the
alternative,
we
are
then
foreclosed
from
the
court
of
claims.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
can't
get
the
just
compensation
to
which
we
are
entitled.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
no
sir.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
no,
this
was
one
of
the
contentions
made
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
i
would
quote
from
the
decision
in
benz
within
if
--
you
follow
this
along
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
--
for
this
case.
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“this
leaves
plaintiff
without
any
remedy
by
suit,”
without
any
remedy.
it
didn't
say
we
could
anywhere
else.
but
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
this
was
the
suggestion
made
by
respondent
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
case
to
show
that
this
was
the
reason.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
oh
i
would
imagine
so,
there
being
a
two-year
statute.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
the
--
a
statute
limitations
for
provide
--
for
filing
of
claim
had
run
the
question
as
the
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitation.
there
is
no
--
i'd
say
i
imagine
it
has.
i
wonder
whether
the
statute
would
be
told
in
the
event
of
actual
fraud.
but
the
contention
here
is
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
that
claim
which
respondent
made
is
at
all
open
in
this
case.
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
show
how
it
has
been
explained
by
that
court
and
i
think
they
will
get
rid
of
this
--
this
contention
that's
made.
that
this
leaves
plaintiff
without
any
remedy
by
suit
but
the
immunity
of
the
state
agency
is
in
no
way
affected
by
the
lack
of
any
other
remedy.
they
set
up
the
immunity.
they
say,
“too
bad,
you
have
to
other
remedy;
that
you
might
have
done
this
or
you
might
do
that.”
now
then,
what
do
they
mean
by,
“this
leaves
plaintiff
without
any
remedy
by
way
of
suit?”
for
that
we
have
to
go
back
one
case
and
ahead
one
case.
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
easley
case
which
i
cited
on
page
13
of
my
reply
brief
and
there
they
--
the
court
said,
“because
of
sovereign
immunity,
none
of
the
existing
courts
could
take
jurisdiction
over
such
claims
unless
the
legislature
should
so
permit.”
that's
in
the
doctrine
or
sovereign
immunity.
not
that
we
could
go
in
the
court
of
claims,
so
that
we
had
anywhere
else
to
go
but
because
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity,
none
of
the
existing
courts
could
take
jurisdictions.
and
then
following
our
case
to
--
to
put
the
nails
further
in
the
--
in
the
coffin,
they
took
the
moses
case
cited
which
i
quote
from
on
the
top
of
page
13,
“decisions
such
as
benz
versus
new
york
state
thruway
authority
are
expressive
of
a
constitutional
and
legislative
policy
that
public
authorities
should
be
subjected
only
to
those
procedures
which
have
been
specifically
mandated.”
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
any
court
of
any
suit
against
an
authority
except
that
the
legislature
has
in
terms
created
such
jurisdiction
--
there
is
no
place
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
we
raised
this
constitutional
question
properly
in
the
court
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
yes,
i
understand
your
honor.
the
fact
that
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
well
again,
all
i
can
say
is
that
we
raised
the
question
and
the
facts
--
the
fact
that
the
new
york
courts
chose
to
ignore
it
in
their
decision,
i
would
say
should
normally
be
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
that's
right,
sir.
except
the
fact
is
that
there
is
a
new
york
court
which
by
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
the
new
york
exists
for
this
specific
purpose
pursuant
to
the
constitutional
grant
of
authority
to
handle
all
suits
in
all
(voice
overlap).
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
well
in
that
--
if
that
--
to
follow
that
through
then,
we
would
be
forced
to
--
after
all
of
this
to
then
commence
another
action
entirely
in
the
district
court
of
the
western
district
of
new
york.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
no
but
i
can't
in
view
of
the
--
the
authorities
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
i
can't
feel
that
that
would
be
the
normal
and
the
proper
result.
i
feel
at
this
court
can
properly
hold
that
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
does
provide
a
supreme
court
which
does
in
fact
have
this
jurisdiction.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
well,
your
first
step,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
first
thing
that
you
could
do
is
the
state
that
the
action
here
was
an
--
an
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
property
without
just
compensation.
this
it
seems
to
me
is
clear.
then
if
you
were
to
remand
the
case
to
be
heard
by
the
new
york
state
supreme
court,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
new
york
state
supreme
court
would
in
fact
hear
this
case
and
the
case
would
be
determined.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
i
have
that
on
good
authority
from
judge
desmond.
we
discussed
that
at
length.
this
is
extra
judicial.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
been
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
sir?
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
yes,
sir.
i
have
complete
set
here
that
i
can
leave
with
the
court.
these
questions
were
in
fact
raised
in
the
briefs.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
yes
sir,
i
will.
because
we
are
finding
here
for
the
first
time
in
united
states
supreme
court
that
a
state
seeks
to
avoid
the
mandate
of
the
requirement
of
just
compensation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
interposing
the
immunity
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
now,
the
state
courts
had
held
just
compensation
to
be
an
exception
to
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right.
i
think
the
best
--
the
best
quotation
that
we
found
on
this,
from
--
from
any
case
was
that
in
the
chick
springs
case
which
i
cite
on
page
9
of
our
brief.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
there,
the
court
said
and
i'd
like
to
read
this.
“neither
the
commonwealth
nor
any
of
its
political
subdivisions
is
liable
in
action
ex
delicto
unless
made
liable
by
express
enactments
of
the
general
assembly,
except
where
the
acts
complained
of,
in
effect,
constituted
a
taking
of
private
property
for
public
use
without
just
compensation.
they
are
held
liable
where
they
take
property
not
upon
the
grounds
that
they
are
authorize
by
statute
to
be
sued
but
because
of
the
constitutional
provision
requiring
compensation
to
be
made
for
such
taking.
this
protection
is
afforded
to
the
humblest
citizen
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
--
of
the
state
in
the
united
states.
and
neither
government
can
itself
by
any
statute
or
through
any
agency
take
property
without
paying
just
compensation.
immunity
from
suit
cannot
avail
in
this
instance.
to
hold,
otherwise,
would
be
to
say
that
the
constitution
itself
is
a
right
which
the
legislature
may
deny
by
failing
or
refusing
to
provide
a
remedy.
such
a
construction
would
indeed
make
the
constitutional
provision
a
hollow
mockery
instead
of
the
safeguard
for
the
rights
citizens.
now,
as
i
said,
the
new
york
court
is
held
that
the
petitioner
was
it
--
was
without
any
remedy.
they
have,
thus,
effectively
barred
any
legal
action
by
defrauded
citizen.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
yes,
they
would
--
yes.
well,
there
was
an
appropriation.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
that
the
land
has
been
taken,
yes
sir
and
alleged
the
appropriation
on
the
agreement
of
adjustment.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
in
the
complaint
is
the
fact
that
the
fraud
of
the
respondents.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
fraud.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
yes
sir.
there's
--
there's
nothing
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
the
court
in
fact
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
i
think
it's
conceded
that
there
was
in
fact
the
takings
sir
unless
i've
misunderstand
you.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
yes,
sir.
there
--
there
would
have
to
be
because
there
was
an
appropriation.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
they
have
held
that
their
court
--
that
at
their
court
isn't
that
jurisdiction
to
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
they
have
said
no
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
no.
they
have
no
jurisdiction
to
rescind
or
reform
this
agreement.
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
--
in
equity
and
i
think
this
is
--
this
may
answer
the
other
question.
they
say
they
have
knocked
this
jurisdiction
because
the
respondent
partakes
of
the
immunity
of
the
sovereign.
now,
if
the
respondent
in
fact
does
not
partake
of
the
immunity
of
the
sovereign
then
the
very
basis
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
determination
must
fall
and
there
is
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
this
has
been
determined
to
be
a
federal
question,
your
honor
in
the
hopkins
versus
clemson
college
case.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
which
hopkins
versus
clemson
college
which
we
cite
on
page
15
of
our
brief.
in
that
case,
the
landowner
sued
for
damages
to
his
land
caused
by
flooding
after
a
dike
had
been
built.
the
defendant
claimed,
the
respondent
claimed
much
as
--
respondent
claims
here.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
the
respondent
was
clemson
college,
was
an
agent
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
south
carolina.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
south
carolina.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
and
they
claimed
that
they
were
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
state
by
the
authority
of
the
state
and
that
they
were
building
this
--
this
dike
and
as
a
governmental
act,
as
an
agent
of
the
state
and
the
issue
in
that
case
was
specifically
held
to
be
whether
a
public
corporation
may
avail
itself
of
the
state's
immunity
from
suit.
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
it
isn't
that.
it's
a
question
of
whether
a
department
or
an
agency
or
a
public
corporation
which
this
in
fact
is
can
partake
of
the
immunity
of
the
state.
and
this
i
think
is
a
federal
question
because
after
all
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
immunity
which
is
in
--
in
effect
granted
by
the
eleventh
amendment
can
be
delegated
by
that
state
and
again
if
i
can
quote
from
--
from
the
hopkins
case.
but
immunity
from
suit
is
a
high
attribute
of
sovereignty,
a
prerogative
of
the
state
--
excuse
me
of
the
state
itself
which
cannot
be
availed
of
by
public
agents
when
sued
from
their
own
torts.
the
whole
frame
and
scheme
of
the
political
institutions
of
this
country
state
and
federal,
protest
against
expanding
to
any
agent
the
sovereign
exemption
from
legal
process.
so
that
i
would
--
ms.
lauren
d.
rachlin
south
carolina
state
court,
you
honor.
now,
we've
contended
that
even
if
the
state
is
immune
from
suit
that
it
cannot
delegate
its
immunity
to
a
public
corporation.
now,
the
growth
of
the
public
authority
is
one
of
the
most
important
single
developments
in
--
in
this
particular
area
of
the
law
in
the
last
several
decades.
new
york
alone
has
over
100
public
authorities
in
--
involves
in
the
state
of
new
york
a
multibillion
dollar
operation
and
this
can
be
multiplied
by
50
states.
the
purpose
of
the
public
corporation
is
to
provide
independent
autonomous
operation
to
protect
the
state
from
liability
and
at
the
same
time,
re
--
avoid
the
restrictions
which
are
normally
takes
place
upon
the
state.
thus
the
thruway
authority,
the
members
of
the
authority
are
under
the
--
the
board
for
nine
year
term.
they
have
the
right
to
issue
fines,
to
fix
tolls,
to
take
land,
to
enter
contracts,
to
police
their
own
facilities.
they
have
the
full
powers
of
a
public
corporation
including
the
right
to
sue
and
be
sued.
they
are
not
directly
responsible
to
the
state
or
to
the
local
government
nor
are
they
even
responsible
to
the
people.
now,
under
the
benz
decision,
they
are
not
even
responsible
to
the
courts
and
as
i
say,
they
have
achieved
the
degree
of
autonomous
irresponsibility
that
has
--
has
been
completely
unknown
in
our
law.
and
according
to
a
law
review
article
which
i
cite
in
my
brief,
this
presents,
“a
fertile
area
for
sovereign
irresponsibility.”
now,
we
make
a
final
--
or
i
should
say
this
about
the
--
the
hopkins
case.
they
--
the
discussions
which
we
mentioned
does
talk
about
the
public
corporation.
and
then
it
goes
in,
in
the
very
last
paragraph
or
two,
they
indicate
that
if
the
dike
had
to
be
removed,
if
that
there
was
affirmative
action
required
by
the
state
that
in
that
event,
they
have
to
make
the
state
a
party
and
the
state
would
be
in
that
case
immune.
but
i
contend
that
this
is
far
different
from
saying
that
the
state
made
by
naked
power
deprived
the
petitioner
of
her
property
without
just
compensation.
it
is
--
excuse
me,
different
from
saying
that
although
the
federal
court,
the
federal
constitution
provides
a
rate
of
just
compensation
that
the
state
can
say
as
it
did
sovereign
immunity
is
not
affected
by
the
essence
of
a
remedy.
now,
i
did
take
the
opportunities.
our
time
is
coming
close
to
an
end,
the
opportunity
to
look
into
the
constitutional
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
to
see
what
was
said
whether
that
the
time
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
passed
whether,
they
concerned
themselves
on
the
issue
of
sovereign
immunity
as
opposed
to
this.
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
is
--
the
primary
concern
was
the
right
of
the
individual,
not
the
right
of
the
state,
the
feeling
at
that
time
throughout
the
entire
congressional
record
was
not
one
of
concern
for
the
state.
there
were
concern
to
protect
by
national
law
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
all
the
citizens
of
the
republic.
i'll
finish.
