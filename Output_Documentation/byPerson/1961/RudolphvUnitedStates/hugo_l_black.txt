how
do
you
say
they
qualified
to
attend
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
were
invited
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
depends
largely
on
the
amount
of
insurance
they've
written
the
year
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
see,
it's
not
circuit
judges
in
a
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
it's
not
--
that
element
is
not
present
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it
was
compulsory
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
them
to
attend.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
what
(inaudible)?
would
there
be
any
difference
in
the
statutory
compulsion
and
the
employer-employee
compulsion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
just
asking
if
that
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
think
it's
--
don't
you
think
it's
conceivable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
think
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
think
it's
conceivable
that
a
man
wouldn't
want
to
go
to
new
york
and
unless
he
is
compelled
to
do
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
have
a
program
at
this
meeting
which
was
calculated
to
improve
that
the
capacity
of
the
agents
to
purchase
insurance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
to
inspire
them
to
produce
more
insurance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
that
--
is
it
a
general
rule
that
they
do
not
allow
tax
--
taxing
(inaudible)
will
not
allow
deductions
for
things
like
these,
for
insurance
companies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
do
you
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
what
each
convention
was
and
what
each
one
did
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
another
insurance
company
might
call
its
agent
new
york
and
i
presume
do,
the
others
can
do
it,
aren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
are
they
given
deductions
in
some
instances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they're
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
rather
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
--
your
test
is
whether
it's
predominant
for
pleasure
or
predominant
for
business.
i
presume
in
that
the
man
went
to
honolulu
on
a
convention
and
--
balance
should
be
pretty
heavy
against
him,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can't
make
it
turn
altogether
on
pleasure
there
or
of
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
ex
post
facto?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
ex
post
facto?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question?
does
the
evidence
showed
here
that
their
wives
were
considered
by
the
company
as
being
a
necessary
part
of
the
carrying
on
with
the
business
for
the
husband?
and
does
it
show
that
the
--
they're
inquiries
about
their
wives
to
find
out
if
they
had
that
capacity
and
if
the
company's
wanted
their
wives
to
come
with
them
on
this
trip
were
they
had
these
conventions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
finding
that
that's
not
a
fact?
