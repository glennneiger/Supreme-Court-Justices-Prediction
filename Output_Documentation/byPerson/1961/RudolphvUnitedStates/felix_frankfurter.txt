the
total
was
added
to
his
appropriate
need
to
be
recorded,
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
filed
income?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
an
issue
of
income?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
proportionate,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
oh,
yes.
i
get
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
get
it
around
to
it
just
both
you
and
mr.
jones
would
point
out
the
difference
of
--
the
analogy
between
something
that
happened
to
me
before
i
came
down
and
dispose
namely,
once
a
year
there's
a
meeting
of
the
association
of
american
law
students,
each
law
students
sends
the
delegation
of
law
professors
to
meetings
and
that
was
--
the
expenditure
was
covered
by
the
law
--
this
was
(inaudible)
--
i
don't
know
what
happens
now,
was
covered
by
the
law
schools,
somebody,
i
think
i'm
not
sure;
my
recollection
is
poor.
but
the
--
certainly
the
traveling
expenses
were
centrally
taken
cared
of.
now,
i
cannot
even
tell
you
what
was
done
or
what
should
be
done.
i
just
want
you
to
keep
that
in
mind
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
government's
position
is
that
it
is
arguable
that
in
going
to
those
christmas
time
meetings,
the
cost
of
going
there,
the
railroad
expenses
in
those
days,
by
hotel
rooms,
etcetera
was
part
of
my
income.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
i
don't
mean
that
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
that's
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you?
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
the
relation
of
these
convent
--
what
are
does
this
call,
conventions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
relation
of
the
expenditure
of
the
convention
purposes
to
the
employer
unrelated
with
the
problem
before
us?
if
the
relation
--
are
we
unconcerned
with
the
bearing
of
the
money
outlay
by
the
insurance
company
were
these
--
were
the
physiques
by
their
agents
at
this
convention,
is
that
--
are
we
unconcerned
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
case
of
an
employer,
of
a
potential
insured,
sending
an
employee
of
his
to
talk
with
a
fire
insurance
agent
and
you're
going
up
--
to
go
with
him
at
lunch
for
which
the
agent
pays,
the
relation
of
that
to
his
employers'
activity
is
relevant,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
another
gain,
he
stayed
at
home,
he
would've
had
to
pay
for
his
own
meal
and
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
statutory
definition
of
gross
income?
justice
felix
frankfurter
gross
income
is
whatever
gross
income
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
need
to
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
suggest
that
he
doesn't
want
to
go
on
a
joy
ride?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
doesn't
--
why
doesn't
it,
the
mode
of
selection
show
that
it
is
--
becomes
of
function
of
reward
rather
than
a
compulsion
of
duty
or
a
manifestation
of
requirement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
related
to
how
much
insurance
you'd
written
and
you
therefore
say,
"you're
a
good
boy.
you
go
out
to
miami
or
to
palm
beach."
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
the
eligible
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
and
most
of
those
who
go
there
do
not
participate
in
any
formal
program
and
most
of
it,
if
i
can
go
on
my
experience,
or
to
talk
since
most
of
it
is
talk
in
the
corridors
and
in
the
bar
room.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
really.
you
don't
really
mean
that
you
could
find
out
to
what
extent,
you're
present
inside
of
a
big
room
or
so,
that's
even
more
important
thing
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
conveyed
a
short
for
you
mr.
jones
if
i
may
suggest
that
the
statute
requires
attendance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judicial
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
need
--
i'm
not
talking
about
what
every
circuit
justice
by
statute
is
supposed
to
attend
by
statute
judicial
conference
of
this
circuit,
isn't
that
true?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
suggestion
a
little
earlier,
it
isn't
compulsion,
is
it
compulsion?
but
compulsion
isn't
the
determining
quality
whether
it's
a
proper
and
necessary
business
expense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
even
introduce
compulsion?
in
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
particular
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
comparing
the
sense
of
business
practice,
business
pleasure
and
not
compulsion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
displeasing
the
boss.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggest
--
i'm
suggesting
if
business
purposes
affirms
favor
a
strong
desire
that
they
meet
together
but
that
we'll
just
listen
to
a
case,
a
different
kind
of
compulsion.
that
exerts
a
force
of
pressure,
an
atmosphere
which
is
very
different
from
saying,
"i
want
to
go
to
miami
or
florida
beach
to
have
a
good
time."
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
do
this
initiate?
where
do
this
originate?
where
do
the
whole
scheme
gotten
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
of
--
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
was
the
moving
force?
was
it
going
also
having
a
good
time
or
responding
to
the
needs
expressly
to
the
company,
which
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
all
the
claims
of
company
interest
is
really
the
fa√ßade
of
the
near
or
pretense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
other
way
around?
the
desire
of
the
company
to
have
their
agents
do
something
which
as
a
consequence
also,
namely
the
people
from
(inaudible)
and
omaha
and
where
not
to
new
jersey
or
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
put
it
the
other
way
around
then
you'd
--
then
it
would
be
different,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
suggestion
that
--
which
purpose
predominates
depends
on
what
direction
of
vision
to
give
to
the
trier
of
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
told
that
wives
are
a
fact
of
life,
i
was
thinking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
jones,
i
have
a
--
i
have
a
greater
difficulty
in
some
of
these
charming
questions.
you
indicate
the
circumstances
under
which
he
is
living
(inaudible)
expenses
that
you
form
a
program
and
so
on,
is
that
right?
if
you
are
advising
this
company
after
a
decision
restraining
your
present
submission,
you
wouldn't
have
great
difficulty
formulating
a
program
that
would
take
care
of
all
the
qualifications
that
you
gave
us,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean
you
could
lay
out
a
program
like
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
a
law
school
programs.
i
can
assure
you
the
burden
of
those
law
school
programs
sit
very
likely
on
law
professionals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
talk
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
strike
out
--
mr.
stenographer
strike
out
everything
i've
said
that's
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
new
taxable
won't
anything
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
anything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
luncheon,
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
involves
for
me
whether
these
business
whether
--
a
second
part
of
the
certain
aspects
of
the
case,
taken
you
probably
know
about
the
mediterranean
greeks,
the
greeks,
some
are
voyages
in
which
they
got
a
regular
program
of
distinguished
salads
having
the
people
enjoying
--
to
enjoy
a
--
rooms
in
the
mediterranean
greek
islands,
have
all
of
the
greek
islands
and
have
some
of
the
ablest
scholars,
greek
scholars
lecture
there.
now,
they
come
to
know
any
number
of,
not
any
number
but
several
instructors
or
professors
of
greek
history
would
--
it
would
surely
be
a
part
of
that.
i
don't
see
why
that
isn't
just
as
important
as
buying
books
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
answer
would
be
jobs,
varied
jobs,
the
idea
of
that
in
court,
going
for
each
one
of
these
separate
things
to
find
out
how
many
lectures
he
have
slept
through
whether
in
his
bunk
or
in
the
chair,
leaves
to
me
to
ask
the
courts
to
do
more
merits
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
jones,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
turn
to
page
100
in
the
record
in
the
first
two
sentences,
on
the
top
of
page
a
hundred,
if
--
it's
your
answer
to
what
judge
brown
there
says
that
this
is
a
question
of
fact
duly
submitted
to
the
trier
and
found
by
the
trier?
and
that
he's
making
a
question
of
law
out
of
all
these
questions
of
fact,
is
that
what
you
would
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
is
involved
is
the
right
of
termination
under
a
contract
granting
the
employer
the
right
of
termination
at
will
if
the
thing
is
at
stake.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
judge
brown's
view
i
take
it
implies
that
the
surrounding
circumstances
negative
what
you've
said.
you
mutilate
the
complex
of
fact
by
saying
he
went
to
new
york
because
he
had
a
good
time.
but
brown
says
the
whole
circumstance
as
the
nature
of
his
employment
is
that
if
he
didn't
go
to
have
a
good
time,
he
might
have
no
time
at
all
with
this
company.
