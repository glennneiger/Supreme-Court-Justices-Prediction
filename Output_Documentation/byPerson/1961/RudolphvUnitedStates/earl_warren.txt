very
well.
mr.
freling,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question
and
i
know
you've
got
a
very
little
time
but
suppose
that
the
employer
in
this
case
had
said,
"we
want
that
all
of
these
people
who
have
written
a
million
dollars
worth
of
insurance
last
year
to
go
to
this
convention."
we're
not
going
to
pay
their
expenses
but
we
order
them
to
go
just
the
same
as
--
in
the
la
--
same
language
that
they
did
in
this
case,
would
that
be
deductible?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there'd
be
no
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
that's
all
i
have.
