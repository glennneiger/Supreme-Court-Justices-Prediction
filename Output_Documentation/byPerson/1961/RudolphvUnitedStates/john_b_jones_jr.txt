mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
make
clear
at
the
outset
that
the
government
does
not
dispute
that
there
are
some
businesses
assemblages
which
employees
can
attend
and
they
can
receive
their
reimbursement
and
there
won't
be
any
tax
consequences.
and
these
business
assemblages
can
take
place
at
a
resort
spot
or
a
tourist
spot
can
be
solely
for
the
employees
of
one
company.
these
are
not
conclusive
factors.
but
the
government
does
insist
that
not
every
trip
which
an
employer
chooses
to
call
a
convention
is
a
business
trip.
there
must
be
some
tests
which
enable
us
to
determine
whether
we
have
a
business
trip
or
a
pleasure
joint.
to
take
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
which
he
asked
that
i
addressed
myself
to
referring
to
an
annual
meeting
of
presumably
law
school
professors
around
the
nation,
if
it
is
found
that
a
meeting
for
program
is
conducted
at
the
site
of
this
meeting
and
if
its
further
found
that
the
law
school
professor
goes
to
this
meeting
and
participates
to
a
reasonable
extent
has
his
discussions
with
his
fellow
professors
and
this
is
essentially
business
oriented.
of
course,
we
make
quibble
about
whether
he
puts
it
in
income
and
then
deducts
his
funds
or
whether
he
never
puts
it
in
income
at
all.
but
the
--
it
is
clear
that
he
has
no
tax
consequences.but
it
is
also
clear
that
it
would
have
irrational
revenues.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well
i
used
the
word
"quibble."
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
that
his
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
--
travel
fare
was
paid
by
somebody
else.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
certainly
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
believe
there's
respectful
authority
that
expenses
of
looking
for
a
job
are
--
do
get
you
in
trouble
on
deduction.
if
you're
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
$30
a
day
for
expenses.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
there
is
a
difference
between
$30
and
expenses.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no,
i
--
we
would
--
it
would
seem
to
us
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
but
there
are
some
sessions
at
a
judicial
conference
by
and
large
those
who
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
pardon?
if
we
found
a
case
of
a
member
of
the
judiciary
attending
such
convention
and
not
attending
any
of
the
formal
sessions,
it
might
be
well
to
have
an
inquiry
just
what
he
did
do
at
his
time.but
i
would
think
in
the
case
you've
posed
that
you
could
make
a
pre
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
sessions
are
inclusive.
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
incumbent
on
somebody
claiming
that
this
is
a
business
trip
to
say
something
about
what
he
actually
did
at
this
convention.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
not
my
case.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
--
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
--
wanted
to
turn
on
that.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
think
the
statutory
compulsion
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
--
outside
which
is
certainly
not
present
here.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
statutory
compulsion,
i
was
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i'd
be
glad
to
turn
to
that
point
because
i
think
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no
--
yes,
sir,
but
i
do
believe
there
would
be.
one
of
the
things
we
would
suggest
in
terms
of
compulsion
is
that
that
is
not
a
magic
test.
and
the
easiest
way
i
know
to
explain
it
is
to
give
you
the
case
of
a
man
who's
48
years
old
working
for
the
company.
he
gets
called
into
the
president's
office.
and
the
president
says
to
him
"bill,
you're
48.
and
we
want
to
give
your
promotion
and
some
new
salary",
and
he
says
"heck,
no."
he
says
"i
like
what
i'm
doing.
i'm
having
a
fine
time.
i
just
don't
want
anymore
responsibilities."
and
the
president
says,
"sorry."
he
said,
"you
know,
its
company
policy,
you
can't
stay
past
50
unless
you
come
into
the
front
office
and
we're
going
to
insist
you
do
it."
and
the
employee
then
further
says,
"well,
i
--
i'll
come
to
the
front
office
but
i
won't
take
the
money."
and
he
says,
"no,
we
can't
have
that.
we've
got
to
front.
you've
got
to
take
the
money.
and
if
you
don't,
you'll
lose
your
job."
the
employee
says,
"well,
if
that's
the
case,
i'll
do
it."
now,
there's
pure
compulsion
we
believe
everything
he
says
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
think
it
--
well,
i
think
this
is
important
because
this
goes
to
the
whole
point
of
--
we
--
the
southland
insurance
company
here
is
being
generous
in
the
sense
in
compelling
this,
if
we
accept
their
testimony,
compelling
this
four
insurance
agents
to
take
a
trip
to
new
york.
they
have
to
tell
their
wives
and
drag
them
along.
it's
a
very
sad
thing.
i
don't
really
think
that
the
case
i
posed
is
very
different.
and
i
don't
think
that
compulsion
is
the
test.
maybe
one
way
to
deal
with
it
is
to
say
that
compulsion
to
be
considered
in
the
sense
must
be
operative.
it
must
be
that
the
man,
not
that
the
company
said
it's
compulsory
but
that
that's
the
reason
the
man
went.
and
when
the
benefit
gets
too
great
as
in
cash
or
a
very
pleasurable
trip
then
we
will
take
with
a
grain
of
salt
and
the
testimony
that
the
trip
is
required,
if
the
company
founds
on
it.
that
isn't
why
he
went
to
new
york.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
oh,
it's
not
conformity,
it's
greed.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
he
goes
to
new
york
because
he
wants
to
go
to
new
york.
he
so
testified
that
if
they
offered
him
this
trip
tomorrow,
he'd
take
it.
that's
on
page
43
of
the
record.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
he
made
--
that's
the
whole
crux
of
the
case.
there
is
no
compulsion
here.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
--
certainly,
it's
conceivable.
but
i
don't
think
it
was
operative
here.
this
man
said
he'd
go
again
tomorrow
if
he
wanted
to.
if
you
can
prove
that
compulsion
is
operative
then
i
think
it
has
some
legal
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
to
sell
insurance?
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
there
is
certainly
portions
of
this
meeting,
can
be
interpreted
as
having
that
purpose.
they
--
there
was
an
inspirational
address
at
the
luncheon,
there
was
talk
about
the
company
and
its
policies
where
it
was
going
in
the
next
year
or
so.
there
was
two
--
a
morning
meeting
and
then
a
luncheon
immediately
following.
and
that's
all
that
happened
at
the
convention.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
would
--
we
would
say
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
certainly
are,
we
have
another
one
inserted.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes.
but
what
it
depends
on
is
an
analysis
of
whether
we
have
here
a
business
convention
with
the
training
of
employees
is
significant
to
per
dominant
factor
on
the
one
hand
or
whether
despite
minimal
trappings
of
a
business
convention,
it
is
essentially
a
pleasure
trip
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no,
that
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
there's
a
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
--
suggestion
by
the
petitioners
here
that
it
is
completely
unreasonable
to
include
an
income
something
which
they
are
compelled
to
accept.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
see.
i
--
i've
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
but
can't
we
highlight
the
issue
if
we
strengthen
--
i've
--
i
am
giving
them
credit
for
more
compulsion
that
is
here
operative
and
i
said
even
if
it
was
told
in
those
terms,
we
still
wouldn't
let
our
48-year-old
man
exclude
from
income
the
amount
which
he
was
forced
to
take.
and
if
compulsion
isn't
relevant
there
then
i
don't
think
its
relevant
here
where
the
compulsion
is
much
less.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
true.
i
would
think
that
the
compulsion
here
though
was
operative
only
to
say
that
i
go
to
new
york
in
1956.
beyond
that,
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
--
that
compulsion
was
the
operative
reason
for
the
trip.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
of
life
insurance
conventions?
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that
we'd
submit
is
a
problem
that
is
left
to
the
trier
of
fact
and
we
think
he
here
answered
it.
that
was
clearly
the
pleasure
aspects
that
predominated.
if
in
a
given
case,
the
man
wanted
to
show
that
there
--
the
accomplished
business
activities
there,
the
trier
of
fact
might
be
--
reach
a
different
conclusion.
but
here,
the
trier
of
fact
said
that
this
was
the
taking
of
a
pleasure
trip
by
these
people.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
or
it
can
coexist.
if
you
have
a
--
an
intent
to
take
a
pleasure
trip
of
this
nature,
it's
not
inconsistent
that
they
coexist,
the
company
intend
to
mobilize
this
general
desire
of
their
agents
to
take
a
trip
to
a
far-off
city.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
in
that
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
we
say
that
the
inquiry
here
is
which
one
predominates.
we
don't
know
any
--
and
it's
never
been
suggested
any
other
way
out
of
the
dilemma
the
regulations
have
explicitly
made
that
the
test
that
somebody
has
to
determine
in
this
post
cases
which
mode
predominates.
here
the
district
court
laid
his
findings
along
the
lines
suggested
by
the
regulation.
the
circuit
court
has
reviewed
and
found
this
in
accord
with
its
prior
decision
in
thomas
and
patterson.
we're
not
only
faced
with
the
--
the
cleared
erroneous
rule
on
this
point.
we
are
also
faced
with
the
two
court
rule
which
i
think
it's
an
even
stronger
barrier
to
review
than
the
cleared
erroneous
one.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
would
--
this
goes
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
determining
whose
point
of
view
you
look
--
whose
point
of
view
you
use
to
determine
the
business
purpose
is
not
the
great
hurdle
which
it
would
seem.
the
point
was
made
that
the
trial
judge
here
looked
at
it
from
the
employees'
point
of
view
and
this
is
considered
to
be
fatal
error
to
our
brief.
in
point
of
fact,
if
you
read
the
specific
findings
you'd
see
he
looks
to
the
company
and
what
he
had
meant
to
do
as
well
as
the
effect
on
the
employee.
and
i
really
think
that
what
you
have
here
is
an
alternative
reference.
in
the
last
analysis,
if
you
can
find
a
truly
sufficient
business
purpose
to
the
company,
it
matters
not
that
the
employee
is
happy
to
go.
and
i
can
illustrate
that
by
an
example.
if
the
southland
insurance
company
had
set
up
a
crackerjack
program
with
two
hours
of
meetings
in
the
morning
and
three
hours
every
afternoon,
meals
and
places
where
the
employees
could
get
together
and
exchange
their
valuable
information.
some
recreation
--
if
they
agreed
the
--
planned
the
program
to
do
the
kind
of
thing
they
said
they
wanted
to
do
that
would
end
it
even
though
mr.
rudolph
said
he'd
go
again
tomorrow
if
his
expenses
were
paid.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that
would
--
if
we
could
show
a
sufficient
business
purpose
to
the
company
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
--
that
they
--
they
were
not
motivated
by
an
intent
to
confer
a
benefit
on
their
employees
but
rather
to
train
them
in
the
sense
that
they
would
be
better.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
if
we
could
do
that
then
we
would
have
found
that
the
employee
--
the
employer
had
a
sufficient
business
purpose
and
either
it
would
not
be
income
to
the
employee
or
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
if
it
were
income,
it
would
be
deductible.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
training
--
if
the
employer
provides
training
for
an
employee.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
believe
there
is
a
recognized
exempt
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
certain.
i
believe
that
there's
a
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
--
this
business
of
whether
it
does
or
does
not
go
through
income
account
is
not
an
easy
one
to
answer.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
believe
that
training
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
employee
would
not
in
the
end
pay
any
income
tax
because
of
this
benefit.
whether
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
this
will
need
to
be
excluded
from
his
wages
or
included
in
his
wages
and
he
will
be
allowed
a
deduction.
when
we
find
a
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well
a
--
we
start
from
the
fact
that
we're
going
to
take
a
pure
business
convention,
doesn't
have
any
suggestion
of
pleasure
to
be
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
correct.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
if
i
can
break
in
there
i'd
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
think
i
can
suggest
what
--
where
i
would
part
from
you.
the
reason
why
the
first
payments
you've
posed
were
income
to
the
employee
was
because
they
were
in
effect
compensation.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
compensation
is
specifically
included
in
income.
now,
when
i
find
the
business
purpose
as
to
this
new
convention
that
we've
posited
then
i
find
that
that
is
not
intended
this
compensation,
its
training
for
the
benefit
of
the
employer
and
no
longer
compensation.
the
reason
for
including
it
in
the
employees'
income
has
disappeared.
if
we're
getting
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
but
that
would
be
a
sour
continuation
which
will
be
a
different
point.
we
would
still
consider
that
compensation.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
our
answer
to
that
has
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that
--
our
answer
to
that
has
to
be
clear
unless
we
can
run
away
from
the
question
that
insofar
as
the
wife
is
concerned,
it
is
income.
as
to
the
judge,
it
is
--
it
may
--
it
maybe
included
in
income
and
then
deducted
or
else
excluded
from
income
at
the
start.
but
we
would
--
that
that's
very
much
involved
in
this
case,
i
might
as
well
cover
it
now
that
we
just
have
to
draw
a
hard
and
fast
line.
we
feel
on
this
question
of
wives
because
the
very
reasons
which
judge
brown
cited
in
his
dissent
or
both
dissents
in
this
case
and
in
the
thomas
case
that
show
how
good
an
argument
you
can
make
about
a
wife
being
a
part
of
the
business
trip
would
just
create
a
hopeless
task
of
enforcement.
the
regulation
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well
the
--
there
is
--
all
i
can
say
is
that
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
there
are
personal
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well
there
may
--
they
can
reimburse
them
up
to
cover
the
tax.
they
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
they
can
reimburse
it
up
to
cover
up
the
tax.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes,
but
the
--
but
the
form
--
contrary
to
some
earlier
decisions
that
(inaudible)
can
be
resolved
to
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i'd
(inaudible)
--
it
would
require
some
more
time,
devote
of
--
some
more
of
agent's
times
devoted
to
business.
yes,
it
would
have
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes,
but
it
would
be
a
--
it
would
be
a
different
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
perhaps
they've
incorrectly
been
allowed
some
deductions.
i
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
you
were
talk
--
you
are
talking
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
you
were
talking
about
a
different
convention
than
the
one
we
had
here.
if
that
change
in
fact
--
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
this
wasn't
a
close
case
for
the
trier
of
fact
but
i
do
think
it
was
a
case
that
has
to
be
left
to
the
trier
of
fact
and
that
once
he
has
decided
that
it
is
not
profitable
to
be
reviewed
at
this
level.
i
subvert
--
it
is
a
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
don't
want
to
give
too
easy
in
answer
to
that
because
by
and
large,
the
hotels
where
you
can
hold
a
convention
are
in
attractive
cities.
the
unattractive
cities
don't
have
hotels
that
can
take
400
people.
just
on
occasion
there
are
seashore
resorts
or
mountains
resorts.
and
the
way
--
talking
about
away
is
--
if
the
airline
gets
more
of
the
money.
i
mean
this
just
further
away.
so,
you
can't
make
a
turn
entirely
on
the
resort
city.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no,
no,
i
just
don't
think
the
fact
that
you
select
a
--
hawaii
is
--
hawaii
isn't
so
different
from
new
york
city
that
the
result
would
turn
on
that
alone.
the
point
is
that
the
--
every
convention
has
held
in
the
place
that
--
pres
--
let's
say
presumably
more
attractive
than
home.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
at
least
you
go
to
find
out.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
it's
been
suggested
that
the
commissioner
might
publish
such
a
list.
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
when
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
we
think
the
qualification
test
here
on
sales
that
the
agents
sell
a
certain
amount
of
insurance
before
they'd
be
entitled
to
attend
is
itself
in
--
indicative
of
some
intent
to
compensate
for
those
sales.
i
would
suggest
that
the
time
here
in
the
program
is
minimal
or
--
if
--
perhaps
i
can
put
it
this
way,
mr.
justice
harlan.
suppose
that
they
had
eliminated
the
business
meeting,
the
two
hour
business
meeting
and
dr.
norman
vincent
peale's
address,
i
don't
suppose
that
the
insurance
company
would
claim
that
then
they
had
a
deduction
for
business
expense.
just
a
trip
up
and
back,
isn't
--
either
just
--
it
isn't
an
ordinary
expense.
it's
just
isn't
the
kind
of
thing
we're
going
to
let
people
deduct.
maybe
there
weren't
ordinary
is
what
we
hang
it
on
there.
but
--
then
they
add
to
it
a
minimal
business
meeting
and
an
address
by
not
--
dr.
norman
vincent
peale
which
is
re
--
is
somewhat
related
to
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
res
--
reanalysis.
i'm
not
talking
about
anybody's
intent.
but
i
--
i
--
i
just
don't
think
that
the
court
can
lay
down
rules
that
as
long
as
you
have
something
that
looks
like
a
business
meeting
at
a
destination
city,
that's
automatically
a
business
trip
which
entitles
people
to
deduct
their
expenses.
after
all
we
live
in
a
day
where
travel
agencies
are
now
offering
professional
man
so-called
"seminar
cruises"
at
which
doctors
or
lawyers
or
any
other
profession
that
has
enough
to
do.
they
are
told
come
to
bermuda
on
such
and
such
boat
and
we'll
give
you
a
lecture
every
morning
on
some
phase
of
your
activity.
and
then
when
you
get
to
bermuda,
you
have
a
free
time,
come
on
back
and
have
your
morning
of
meeting.
this
is
a
very
--
that
--
he's
going
there
and
he
is
getting
training
perhaps
even
his
employer
will
send
him.
but
we
have
to
keep
our
eyes
open
to
the
realities
of
situation.
he
is
getting
a
very
viable
benefit.
he
is
being
transported
to
bermuda
for
a
vacation
that
would
take
a
great
deal
more
in
taxable
income
for
him
to
be
able
to
provide
that
for
himself.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
--
there
has
been
issued
a
warning
that
this
is
not
an
automatic
deduction,
that
in
each
case,
each
case
will
be
judged
on
its
own
facts
to
determine
whether
greedy
is
related
to
the
business
a
professional
man
who
purports
to
be
attending
a
so-called
"seminar
cruise."
and
again,
i
don't
--
it
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
think
that
the
courts
of
the
country
are
going
have
to
be
resolving
all
this
--
my
nude
factual
questions.
but
i
don't
believe
that
you
would
want
to
issue
a
rule
that
made
the
seminar
cruises
either
all
in
or
all
out.
and
there
will
be
the
--
these
borderline
situations.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no,
it
does
not
really.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
present
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
that's
not
involved
in
this
case.
but
the
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
--
it
does
go
into
the
expense
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
then
that's
just
the
intent
of
the
announcement
of
which
i
have
spoken
that
it
has
to
be
examined
in
the
individual
case.
if
the
professor
skips
out
on
all
of
the
meetings,
sleeps
late
in
the
mornings
and
just
goes
ashore
in
days
when
they're
important,
there
--
a
question
does
arise
whether
you've
been
have
a
deductible
expense.
if
he
gets
as
much
out
of
the
seminar
as
you
impute
to
him
then
in
that
case,
the
primary
purpose
becomes
one
of
business.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
life
insurance
companies
are
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
of
themselves.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
so
that
they
didn't
--
they
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
deduct
but
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
it
is
important
to
bear
for
the
generality
of
cases
in
mind,
the
fact
that
--
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
employer
on
these
expenses.
he
can
deduct
it
in
either
event.
either
its
compensation
or
training
expense
and
subject
to
limitations
on
reasonable
amount.he
has
no
problem.
so
he
doesn't
have
any
particular
reason
to
focus
in
his
own
mind
as
to
what
--
whether
this
is
primarily
to
confer
a
benefit
on
the
employee
or
primarily
to
advance
his
interest.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
deductible
in
either
event.
there
were
no
question
about
that
and
that's
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
but
it
is
not
in
this
case.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
but
we
haven't
yet
established
that
the
employee
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
--
does
pay
a
tax.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
that's
--
i'm
afraid
that
that's
been
long
established.
that
too
is
taxable
income.
there
is
a
formative
to
get
you
off
the
merry-go-round
but
if
payment
of
somebody
else's
income
tax
where
in
you're
in
a
relationship
that
payments
would
otherwise
be
income,
the
payment
of
the
tax
is
still
income.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
it
gets
smaller
each
time
around,
depends
somewhat
on
the
bracket
of
the
employee.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes,
they
could
--
or
i
suggested
that
but
they
--
they
have
to
put
in
the
cover
the
pyramiding
effect.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
there
are
statutes
of
limitations
that
generally
live
--
limited
income
tax
liability
for
three
years
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
the
regulations
that
reg
--
on
the
wife
problem
the
regulations
are
very
clear.
it
is
a
difficult
problem
of
enforcement
but
if
the
--
there
are
revenue
system
--
do
we
have
a
very
explicit
instruction
in
section
262
that
personal
expenses
are
not
deductible?
and
it's
very
hard
to
take
in
the
usual
case.
imagine
in
the
usual
case
had
more
personal
expenses
than
that
of
taking
your
wife
along
now
there
will
be
some
exceptions
on
occasion.
i
would
just
like
to
close
this
argument
by
reminding
the
court
that
the
regulations
under
section
162
are
quite
clear
explicit
on
this
problem,
recognizing
that
there
will
be
trips
that
are
taken
partly
for
business
and
partly
for
pleasure.
and
they
do
impose
on
somebody
the
task
of
determining
which
motive
is
primary.
that
was
done
by
the
district
court
here,
was
affirmed
by
the
fifth
circuit.
and
we
suggest
that
this
court
should
abide
those
findings.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes,
i
think
without
coming
down
hard
on
each
sense
i
think
basically
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
suggesting
that
this
company
does
regard
their
wives
as
important.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
record
and
there's
some
conflict
in
the
brief
on
this
that
he
didn't
--
that
mr.
rudolph
didn't
feel
he
had
to
take
his
wife.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that
would
--
you
can
--
a
husband
and
wife
may
file
a
return
to
get
that
treatment
or
in
a
community
property
estate,
the
estate
law
would
have
that
effect.
but
absent
that,
the
federal
government
doesn't
--
and
these
people
did
file
a
joint
return.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
right.
these
people
did
file
a
joint
return
and
that
doesn't
make
it
any
difference
whose
income
we're
talking
about.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
would
--
the
--
for
the
benefit
of
the
members
of
the
court,
i
take
it
that
--
to
take
a
trip
to
preserve
the
security
is
something
not
done
primarily
for
personal
enjoyment.
that's
what
you're
constraining
on?
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
as
i've
suggested
before
i
think
that
misstates
the
question.
i
think
the
--
the
first
question
is
whether
the
compulsion
which
i
may
--
if
i
may
characterize
as
such,
here
described
what's
really
operative.
and
the
record
is
clear
here
that
that
wasn't
why
he
went
to
new
york.
he
went
to
new
york
because
he
had
a
good
time.
he'd
do
it
again
tomorrow.
now
if
we
found
in
a
given
case
that
the
man
didn't
want
to
go
to
new
york
and
actually
went
because
either
expressed
or
otherwise,
he
was
ensure
of
his
job
then
this
kind
of
consideration
become
important.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
judge
brown
is
looking
only
to
the
testimony,
if
i
may
say,
self-serving
testimony
of
the
company
that
would
have
this
effect
on
them.
and
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
that's
not
all
that
has
to
be
considered.
and
again
as
to
him,
he
would
be
entitled
--
he
should
give
way
to
the
trier
of
fact
on
that
point.
