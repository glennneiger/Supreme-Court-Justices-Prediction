mr.
richard
a.
freling
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
suit
for
refund
of
federal
income
taxes.
petitioner
c.j.d.
rudolph
works
in
dallas
as
an
ordinary
life
insurance
agent
for
southland
life
insurance
company,
a
major
insurance
company
whose
offices
are
also
in
dallas.
in
1956,
he
and
his
wife
attended
a
convention
of
southland
agents
and
officers
in
new
york.
and
their
transportation,
accommodations
and
their
meals
were
arranged
and
paid
for
by
southland.
the
basic
issues
involved
in
this
case
are
first,
whether
or
not
the
amount
of
convention
expense
allocable
to
petitioners
which
has
been
stipulated
by
the
parties
to
be
$560
is
to
be
includable
in
their
gross
income
and
if
that
question
be
answered
in
the
affirmative
whether
petitioners
are
to
be
allowed
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
deduction
for
an
equivalent
amount.
respondent
contends
that
the
convention
trip
was
a
bonus
to
petitioners
and
therefore
his
income
and
that
their
expenses
were
primarily
personal
and
therefore
not
deductible.
we
contend
that
petitioners
were
taken
to
new
york
by
southland
for
business
reasons
without
regard
to
compensation
and
that
the
cost
attributable
to
their
trip
are
not
income
to
them.
alternatively,
we
contend
that
if
they
are
charged
with
income,
the
expenditures
thereby
imputed
to
them
were
incurred
for
ordinary
and
necessary
business
reasons
and
are
therefore
deductible.
once
every
year
and
a
half
for
the
past
20
years
or
more,
southland
has
sponsored
a
convention
of
the
type
involved
here
to
which
it
invites
certain
of
its
agents
and
their
wives
and
the
top
officers
of
the
company
and
their
wives.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
that's
correct,
sir.
once
every
18
months.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
agents
invited
to
attend
are
selected
on
the
basis
of
their
having
sold
or
prescribed
minimum
amount
of
insurance,
which
the
company
believes
as
the
most
appropriate
standard
for
determining
who
has
an
aptitude
for
the
business
and
who
had
benefit
from
the
convention.
when
an
agent
is
invited
to
attend,
both
the
agent
and
the
company
believes
that
it
is
part
of
his
responsibility
and
a
part
of
his
job
to
do
so.
if
he
fails
to
attend
for
any
reason,
he
receives
nothing
in
lieu
of
the
convention.
the
1956
convention
activities
lasted
approximately
one
week
of
which
about
four
days
were
spent
traveling
on
trains,
chartered
trains
to
and
from
new
york
city.
they
spent
about
two
days
in
new
york,
friday
and
saturday.
friday
morning
was
devoted
to
a
formal
program
of
speeches
by
the
top
officers
of
southland
to
a
panel
discussion
of
agents
and
several
lecturers
on
the
agency
program.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
do
not.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
they
do
not
get
a
check
for
anything.
all
the
--
except
to
a
very
limited
extent.
southland
arranged
all
the
transportation,
the
hotel
accommodation,
rooms,
meals
and
paid
the
expenses
directly.
no
money
was
given
to
petitioners
themselves
except
$30
which
was
given
to
every
couple
to
take
care
of
unplanned
meals
in
new
york.
other
than
that
all
the
expenses
were
paid
directly
by
southland.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
that
is
correct
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
mr.
justice
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
well,
the
record
indicates
that
the
total
convention
cost
as
computed
by
southland
accountants
was
figured
and
then
just
divided,
i
assume,
by
the
number
of
people
in
attendance.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
no,
sir,
he
was
not.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
well,
this
was
--
when
the
government
raised
the
issue
as
to
what
was
taxable
to
the
petitioners
and
an
investigation
was
made,
it
was
determined
that
this
would
be
the
appropriate
amount
that
this
was
the
total
cost
to
the
convention
divided
by
the
number
of
people
in
there.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
no,
sir,
he
had
not
included
it
in
his
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
a
deficiency
was
assessed.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
total
amount
that
was
allocable
to
the
petitioners
as
computed
by
southland.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
that's
correct
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
--
brennan.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
of
it
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
well,
i
assume,
it's
--
i
would
use
the
term
"allocable"
that
the
total
cost
were
divided
by
the
number
of
people
in
attendance.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
they
had
to
meet
a
standard
of
having
sold
a
prescribed
minimum
amount
of
insurance
in
the
preceding
year.
and
they
were
then
eligible
to
be
asked
by
the
company
and
the
company
would
invite
them.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
hope
to
touch
on
that
point
expressly
by
an
analogy.
it
is
our
position
that
the
cost
of
your
trip
shouldn't
constitute
income
to
you
in
the
first
instance.but
if
by
some
reason
they're
caught
within
the
broad
web
of
gross
income
and
you
should
be
allowed
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
deduction.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
well,
i
cannot
speak
for
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
--
government
counsel,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
i
would
say
that
the
situation
is
analogous.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
after
the
formal
business
program,
everyone
attended
a
luncheon
at
which
dr.
norman
vincent
peale
gave
an
address
on
the
subject
of
success
through
right
speaking.
and
the
remainder
of
the
time
in
new
york
was
devoted
to
a
group,
a
sightseeing
tour,
a
breakfast
and
fashion
show
for
the
wives
of
the
agents
and
a
planned
dinner
at
the
copacabana.
southland
also
provided
tickets
for
a
special
christmas
show
at
radio
city
music
hall
and
other
periods
were
designated
as
free
time.
in
the
suit
for
refund,
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
texas
sitting
without
a
jury
has
sustained
respondent.
and
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
per
curium
on
the
basis
of
its
recent
prior
decision
in
patterson
versus
thomas
with
judge
brown
adding
his
dissent
in
this
case
to
his
prior
dissent
in
the
thomas
case.
now,
because
the
trial
court
held
that
the
convention
trip
was
in
the
nature
of
a
bonus
and
primarily
a
vacation
to
petitioners,
respondent
would
quickly
reduce
the
issues
in
this
case
to
simply
whether
or
not
the
fact
findings
of
the
district
court
are
clearly
erroneous.
we
submit
that
the
case
is
not
so
simple.
in
our
opinion,
the
case
involves
important
and
compelling
questions
regarding
the
very
basic
concepts
of
gross
income
and
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense.
we
believe
there
is
a
need
for
clarification
and
refinement
of
the
broad
principles
previously
established
by
this
court.
as
those
principles
are
now
applied
to
two
phenomena
of
--
on
modern
business
practice.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
is.
we
believe
that
that
these
principles
now
have
to
be
refined
as
they
are
applied
to
two
things
which
occur
everyday
on
our
business
community.
first,
the
company
convention
and
second
the
compulsion
or
the
coercion
by
employers
upon
their
employees
that
the
employees
participate
and
what
the
employer
believes
to
be
a
legitimate
and
necessary
business
activity.
if
we're
correct
in
interpreting
this
need,
then
the
responsibilities
of
the
trial
court
in
this
case
should
be
restricted
to
their
narrowest
sphere
not
expanded
as
the
respondent
would
do
to
the
utmost
which
might
in
some
other
circumstances
be
permissible.
with
the
law
governing
a
tax
controversy
is
undefined
and
particularly
where
the
principles
of
law
involved
are
far-reaching.
and
the
trial
court
has
drawn
inferences
from
the
undisputed
evidentiary
facts
or
has
decided
ultimate
facts
which
are
dispositive
of
the
case.
then
we
submit
that
this
court
or
indeed
any
appellate
court
shouldn't
hesitate
to
exercise
its
broadest
powers
of
review
because
the
danger
is
great
that
the
trial
judge
may
have
approached
his
job
without
knowledge
or
consideration
of
the
applicable
law
or
even
worst
that
his
understanding
of
the
applicable
law
may
have
been
erroneous.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case
we
believe.
we
believe
the
findings
of
fact
are
clearly
erroneous.
but
we
also
believe
that
such
findings
were
predicated
on
an
error
of
law
resulting
either
from
mistake
in
interpreting
the
governing
legal
principles
or
the
failure
to
recognize
that
those
legal
principles
even
existed.
in
either
event,
we
submit
that
this
court
should
not
now
restrict
its
reviews
simply
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
fact
findings
of
the
district
court
are
clearly
erroneous.
in
our
opinion,
the
error
of
the
district
court
is
apparent
since
he
indicated
that
he
wasn't
concerned
with
the
purpose
of
southland
in
holding
the
convention.
and
if
it
please
the
court,
i
should
like
to
quote
very
briefly
from
the
record,
on
page
79
in
the
district
court's
opinion
towards
the
bottom
of
the
page
he
states,
"it
is
the
purpose
of
the
convention
to
the
taxpayers
which
governs
our
action,
not
the
purpose
of
the
insurance
company
in
holding
them.
yet,
this
would
seem
to
be
the
single
most
important
determination
in
the
case."
and
as
respondent
apparently
agrees
with
us
in
his
brief,
and
if
my
indulge
the
court
once
more
to
quote
from
respondent's
brief
at
page
11
he
states,
"both
parties
are
--
agreed
that
the
relevant
ultimate
facts
upon
which
the
legal
questions
in
this
case
turned
are
(a)
the
reasons
why
the
company
sponsored
and
paid
for
the
trip,
and
(b)
the
reasons
why
petitioner
and
his
wife
took
the
trip
offered
by
the
company,
and
it
slightly
regard
to
the
(b)
part
of
the
sentence.
he
suggest
elsewhere
in
his
brief
at
page
28
that
the
purpose
of
southland
in
holding
a
convention
is
vital
and
important
in
determining
the
purpose
of
the
petitioners
in
attending.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
well,
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
that
is
correct.
but
the
purpose,
the
subjective
purpose
of
the
taxpayers
in
attending
the
convention
is
gleaned
largely
from
the
purpose
of
the
company,
their
employer
in
holding
a
convention
and
requiring
them
to
attend.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
mr.
justice
stewart,
that's
correct
that
the
purpose
of
the
taxpayers
on
the
expense
side
of
the
case
is
the
ultimate
question.
but
in
arriving
in
that
determination,
it's
not
possible
to
separate
the
business
purpose
of
the
company
from
the
business
purpose
of
the
taxpayers
because
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
--
this
wasn't
an
independent
pleasure
joint
which
they
took
of
their
own
volition.
this
was
something
that
they
did
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
--
in
response
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
i
agree,
your
honor.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
your
employer
required
you
to
do
something
to
go
lunch
with
him
and
you
went
and
you
were
charged
with
income
by
virtue
of
his
buying
your
lunch
then
the
reason
why
you
attended
is
important
in
determining
--
or
is
the
ultimate
issue
in
determining
whether
you
can
deduct
the
cost
of
that
lunch
but
his
purpose
in
asking
you
is
also
relevant.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
well,
also
if
you
were
charged
with
income
by
virtue
of
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes.
well
in
our
opinion,
because
of
the
error
of
the
court
in
not
considering
the
business
purpose
of
southland
in
holding
the
convention
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
no,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
we're
very
vitally
concerned
with
it.
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
southland,
the
company
in
spending
time
and
money
and
effort
in
planning
and
paying
for
and
holding
these
conventions
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
case
because
it
demonstrates
both
the
business
purpose
in
southland
in
holding
the
conventions
and
the
reasons
why
they
required
the
agents
to
attend
and
why
the
agents
responded
and
attended.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
--
is
directly
relevant.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
very
definite
sir,
extremely
so.
if
i
may
jump
ahead
in
my
own
timetable
of
argument,
i
hypothesize
for
a
moment.
suppose
that
the
--
an
employee
of
a
dallas
based
company
is
required
by
his
employer
to
travel
to
new
york
city
to
close
a
long
term
loan
with
the
wall
street
financial
institution
and
that
he
returns
immediately
when
his
loan
is
consummated.
and
suppose
further
that
the
employer
arranges
accommodations,
his
transportations
and
his
meals
while
he
was
there
and
paid
for
them
directly.
i
don't
think
anyone
would
seriously
contend
that
the
cost
of
that
trip
should
be
taxable
to
the
employee
as
income.
but
the
appropriate
inquiry
is
why?
well,
we
--
i
think
that
the
reason,
the
answer
is
found
in
precedent
and
practicalities.
the
dominant
business
purpose
of
his
employer
was
the
reason
why
he
took
the
trip
in
the
first
place.
the
trip
wasn't
intended
as
compensation.
and
his
only
gain
was
the
subjective
pleasure
which
he
may
or
may
not
have
experienced
by
virtue
of
his
position.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
i
think
that's
true,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
but
i
think
that
answer
was
resolved
in
1921
when
they
enacted
the
statute
and
permitted
the
deductibility
of
all
meals
and
lodging
away
from
home.
so
our
position
on
the
income
side
of
the
case
is
that
there
are
limited
exceptions
to
gross
income
other
than
those
specifically
enumerated
in
the
statute.
and
we
state
this
board
recognizing
full
well
the
perva
--
the
pervasive
characters
brought
to
gross
income
by
this
court.
for
it
seems
to
us
that
those
very
decisions
which
established
that
broad
character
also
recognized
intrinsically
that
not
every
things
received
by
a
tax
gain,
not
every
gain
in
a
classical
economic
sense
constitutes
income
too.
we're
not
now
asking
the
court
to
restrict
its
broad
definition
of
income.
to
the
contrary,
we're
asking
only
that
the
court
expressly
recognize
the
non-taxability
of
something
that
lies
beyond
that
definition,
which
we
don't
think
has
ever
been
precisely
defined
or
delineate.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
no,
there's
not.
gross
income
is
just
gross
income.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
now,
we
believe
that
this
rational
and
the
law
of
governing
the
hypothesis
which
i
posed
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
court's
decision
in
commissioner
versus
smith
that
compensation
in
whatever
form
constitutes
income.
and
we
think
it's
also
consistent
with
commissioner
versus
glenshaw
glass
company
wherein
the
court
noted
that
the
damages
received
for
fraud
or
any
trust
violations
resulted
in
undeniable
accessions
to
wealth
clearly
realized
and
over
which
the
tax
per
head
complete
dominion.
that
the
trip
taken
by
the
employee
in
my
hypothesis
wasn't
intended
his
compensation
nor
did
he
clearly
realize
any
benefit,
any
accession
to
wealth
over
which
he
had
dominion.
he's
actions
were
governed
and
controlled
by
the
dominant
business
purpose
of
his
employer.
we
believe
that
petitioner
stand
in
basically
the
same
shoes
as
the
employee
in
my
hypothesis.
the
only
distinction
being
that
they
were
personally
involved
in
the
business
purpose
of
a
company.
thus,
an
effort
must
be
made
to
isolate
that
business
purpose
from
a
simple
intent
to
compensate.
but
once
it
can
be
established
as
we
believe
the
uncontroverted
testimony
as
established
here.
that
the
dominant
motive
and
reason
for
the
company
sponsoring
the
convention
was
its
own
business
purpose.
that
the
convention
was
germane
to
that
purpose
based
upon
long
standing
interest,
industry-wide
experience
and
that
there
was
no
intent
to
compensate
petitioners.
and
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
they
received
nothing
which
it
constituted
income,
too.
our
position
on
the
expense
side
of
the
case
is
similar
too
because
we
believe
that
the
same
basic
facts
that
support
an
exclusion
from
gross
income
also
when
turned
around
confirmed
the
presence
of
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses.
the
trial
court
ignored
southland's
business
purpose
in
holding
the
convention.
it
ignored
the
compulsion
upon
the
petitioners
to
attend.
it
ignored
the
relationship
between
the
convention
and
petitioners
own
business.
instead,
the
court
apparently
looked
only
to
the
outward
or
extrinsic
appearances
of
the
convention
in
holding
contrary
to
every
bit
of
the
oral
testimony
that
the
convention
was
in
the
nature
of
a
vacation.
in
the
phase
of
what
would
seem
the
obvious,
an
overwhelming
relationship
between
the
convention
and
the
agent,
this
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
understand
except
for
the
trial
judge's
own
admission
that
he
wasn't
concerned
with
the
business
purpose
of
southland
in
holding
the
convention.
now,
respondent
attempts
to
justify
this
fact
conclusion
on
the
basis
of
two
erroneous
legal
premises.
first,
he
compares
the
times
spent
at
the
formal
program
on
friday
morning
with
the
total
period
covered
by
the
convention
as
if
this
were
conclusive
of
a
non-business
purpose.
the
error
in
this
approach
is
two
fold.
it
assumes
first
that
informal
activity
at
a
convention
cannot
have
a
business
purpose.
but
the
management
of
southland
testified
that
the
program
was
expressly
designed
to
permit
the
agents
and
the
officers
to
mix
and
mingle
together
in
an
informal
atmosphere
and
that
the
exchange
of
ideas
occurring
in
this
manner
probably
was
the
most
important
business
benefit
of
the
convention.
shoptalk
at
a
convention
is
a
part
of
the
business
of
a
convention.
and
it
need
not
be
conducted
in
an
auditorium
to
be
so.
in
the
second
place,
respondent's
comparative
analysis
treats
the
travel
time
to
and
from
new
york
as
being
a
sterile
thing
which
gain
its
tax
character
solely
from
the
activities
at
the
convention
site
but
this
couldn't
be
further
from
the
facts.
southland
intentionally
chartered
special
trainings
on
which
it
required
the
agents
and
the
officers
to
travel
together
so
that
they
would
have
an
opportunity
with
little
else
to
do
to
talk
about
the
insurance
business.
we
believe
therefore
that
the
--
that
the
travel
itself
had
an
independent
business
purpose.
if
we
had
the
travel
time
to
the
formal
time
of
the
program,
we
have
four-and-a-half
days
spent
in
strictly
businesses
compared
to
one-and-a-half
days
in
informal
activities
which
we
also
think
have
legitimate
business
purposes.
so,
on
the
basis
of
respondent's
own
promise
is
that
each
expense
should
be
deductible.
his
next
error
is
an
ignoring
the
company's
insistence
that
rudolph
and
his
wife
attend
the
convention.
we
believe
it's
legally
significant
when
an
employer
required
that
an
employee
participate
in
what
the
employer
in
good
faith
believes
to
be
a
necessary
business
activity.
what
is
the
employee
to
do?
what
should
any
hardheaded
business
man
do
except
to
comply
with
the
request
of
his
employer?
sure,
he
couldn't
argue
with
his
employer
about
whether
or
not
the
convention
bore
a
sufficient
business
relationship
to
his
own
business
to
warrant
his
attending
particularly
where
this
has
been
an
industry-wide
practice
for
30
years
or
more.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
he
certainly
could,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
don't
know
what
his
employer's
reaction
might
be.
we
believe
that
when
rudolph
accepted
the
company's
invitation
to
attend
the
convention,
he
was
acting
in
a
way
that
was
realistically
indispensable
to
his
business.
and
i
think
that
the
evidence
before
the
court
demonstrated
that
there
was
a
reasonable
business
relationship
between
the
convention
and
rudolph
sold
in
business
as
an
insurance
agent.
if
so,
his
expenses
were
both
ordinary
and
necessary
and
directly
related
to
his
business.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
out
of
approximately
300
agents,
102
attended
the
convention
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
i
think
that
there
were
few
more
who
were
invited
and
actually
attended.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
it
does.
there
is
a
standard
prescribed
that
the
agent
has
to
meet
in
order
to
be
eligible
to
attend.
but
i
wish
to
make
this
point
although
my
time
is
running
short,
that
every
business
must
have
a
standard
for
judging
which
of
its
employees
are
going
to
be
advanced
or
brought
into
inner
circle
or
give
a
special
training.
an
associate
in
a
law
firm
might
be
judged
on
the
clarity
of
the
contracts
he
writes.
but
in
--
an
insurance
agent
job
is
selling
insurance.
this
is
the
only
thing
he
does
and
it's
the
only
method
by
which
the
company
can
judge
his
performance.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
well,
we
think
that
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
well,
it's
not
as
simple
as
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
all
they
wanted
to
do
was
to
pay
a
bonus
to
their
agents.
they
could
just
give
him
the
money
and
tell
him
to
go
to
florida.
but
they
don't
do
that.
they
plan
a
convention
based
upon
years
of
experience
with
expressed
business
purposes
marked.
and
they
require
the
agents
to
attend.
if
the
--
if
it
was
their
desire
simply
to
give
a
bonus,
they
certainly
wouldn't
require
that.
furthermore,
they
still
had
to
be
invited
even
though
they
satisfied
the
minimum
standard
of
selling
insurance.
they
still
--
the
record
indicates
that
they
still
had
to
be
invited
by
the
company.
third
of
all,
there
was
no
great
agent
among
the
agents
as
to
how
much
insurance
they
sold.
one
may
have
sold
$2,000,000
and
another
$400,000
and
they
were
still
--
but
they
all
still
received
exactly
the
same
thing.
the
emphasis,
the
dominant
purpose
on
--
of
the
company
was
not
to
reward
or
pay
a
bonus.
although,
certainly
that
the
petitioners
may
have
enjoyed
the
trip
but
this
wasn't
the
basic
primary
emphasis
of
the
company,
it
was
something
else.
it
was
something
much
more
complex
indeed.
it
was
involved
in
modern
business
psychology
and
practices.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
300.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
eligible
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
--
harlan.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
the
record
indicates
that
there
were
102
agents
eligible
in
all
but
10
or
15
attended
the
convention.
i
have
just
a
few
moments
and
rather
than
continue,
i'd
prefer
to
reserve
the
remainder
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
richard
a.
freling
no.
mr.
richard
a.
freling
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
some
specific
inquiries
from
the
bench.mr.
justice
black,
mr.
rudolph
testified
expressly
that
when
he
took
a
vacation,
he
like
to
get
away
from
it
all
and
do
as
he
pleases.
this
is
in
direct
contrast
to
the
enforced
and
rigid
companionship
and
schedule
at
this
convention.
second
of
all,
he
testified
that
he
would
not
wish
to
take
this
trip
again
unless
his
expenses
were
paid
for
by
the
company.
he
did
not
consider
it
a
vacation.
he
considered
it
a
business
requirement
of
his
as
part
of
his
job.
mr.
justice
harlan,
this
convention
is
an
outgrow
for
a
product
of
some
30
or
more
years
of
experience
in
the
life
insurance
industry
based
upon
management
studies
and
experts
in
the
field
that
say
it
has
legitimate
and
valuable
business
purposes.
it
antedates
the
era
of
high
taxes.
and
the
suggestions
of
respondent
that
this
is
just
one
of
the
category
of
expense
account
abuses
which
we've
heard
so
much
about
simply
isn't
the
case.
we
feel
that
for
over
40
years,
these
company
conventions
have
been
going
on
and
yet
no
question
has
been
raised.
this
is
apparently
a
test
case.
and
we
think
that
obviously,
it
was
intended
to
be
pleasurable.
the
company
would
be
exceedingly
unwise
if
it
attempted
to
stimulate
and
motivate
its
agents
in
at
atmosphere
of
rigid
tedious
requirements.
but
this
doesn't
detract
from
its
business
purpose.
the
business
purpose
is
still
the
--
to
gain
stimulation
in
a
way
that
couldn't
be
accomplished
by
paying
the
agents
a
bonus.
it's
diametrically
contrary
to
that.
the
informal
activity
at
the
convention
was
specifically,
one
is
designed
as
such,
is
a
part
of
the
business
of
the
convention.
why
did
the
company
charter
special
trainings
and
have
people
stay
and
enforced
companionship
for
four
days?
