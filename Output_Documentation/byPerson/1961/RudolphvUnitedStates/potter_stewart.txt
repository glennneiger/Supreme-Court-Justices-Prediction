you
say
this
is
not
annual.
it's
every
year
and
a
half?
justice
potter
stewart
two
every
three
years
or
so?
justice
potter
stewart
aren't
you
talking
about
--
which
fraction
of
this
case
you're
talking
about?
i
just
--
i
think
this
--
the
opinion
on
page
79.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you're
talking
about
the
deductibility
of
these
expenses
by
the
taxpayers
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
taxpayers
to
which
you
look,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
the
purpose
of
the
company?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
would
seem
to
me,
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
and
if
so
why,
that
when
you're
talking
about
whether
or
not
this
is
income
to
the
taxpayer,
then
the
purpose
of
the
company
becomes
a
dominant
relevance.
when
you're
talking
about
whether
this
is
deductible,
if
income
whether
it's
deductible
by
the
taxpayers
as
a
business
expense.
then
the
purpose
of
the
taxpayer
in
making
the
trip
becomes
a
dominant
relevance,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
kind
of
begging
the
question
here.
that's
the
question,
isn't
it?
it's
the
purpose
of
the
taxpayer
though
that
--
which
is
relevant
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
determining
whether
or
not
this
is
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
business
expense
to
the
taxpayers,
isn't
that
true?
in
other
words,
if
an
insurance
salesman
takes
me
to
lunch,
it's
his
purpose
in
taking
me
to
lunch
it's
important
in
determining
whether
or
not
that
lunch
is
deductible
from
his
income
for
tax
--
federal
tax
purposes.
justice
potter
stewart
not
my
purpose
in
going
with
him?
justice
potter
stewart
he
takes
me
to
lunch
to
sell
me
insurance
then
it's
perhaps
deductible.
justice
potter
stewart
aren't
you
--
the
deductibility
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
lunch
and
the
bill
from
his
income.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
are
you
getting
in
the
third
--
that's
a
third,
that's
a
question
not
involved
here
i
take
it
to
be.
justice
potter
stewart
he's
not
my
employer.
justice
potter
stewart
well
there
wouldn't
be
any
income
in
that
case,
would
there?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
ordinary
--
the
ordinary
professional
meeting
a
person
goes
and
pays
it
on
his
own
expense
and
then
deducts
him
from
his
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
ended
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
way?
how
was
it
ended?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
then
what?
if
we
could
do
that
then
what
would
follow?
justice
potter
stewart
would
be
income,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
income
to
the
employees
certainly
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
just
like
wages
are
--
wages
are
paid
only
in
connection
with
a
specific
business
purpose
of
the
employee
and
there's
certainly
income
to
the
--
of
the
employer,
there's
certainly
income
to
the
employee?
justice
potter
stewart
the
business
purpose
would
--
it
would
follow
that
there
would
be
income
to
the
employee.
justice
potter
stewart
and
would
be
deductible,
the
expenses
would
be
--
deduct
--
deducted
by
the
employer.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
wondering
what
you're
trying
to
get
at.
if
you
could
find
a
clear
business
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
employer
then
what
would
follow?
and
i
still
don't
see.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
on
his
wages?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
follow
that
all.
i
maybe
pretty
dense
at
the
moment
but
i
just
don't
follow
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
start
very
simply
with
wages.
these
are
paid
by
the
employer
for
a
clear
business
purpose
of
his
own.
they're
received
by
the
employee.
they
were
--
they're
deducted
by
the
employer.
they're
included
in
the
income
of
the
employee
and
not
deducted
by
the
employee.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
let's
say
that
a
convention
is
put
on
by
the
employer
for
the
employer's
clear
business
purpose.
the
employer's
clear
business
purpose
for
training
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
often
in
a
training
program,
you
do
compensate
employees,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
jones,
does
the
record
in
this
case
show
how
the
company
treated
these
expenses?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
right
the
tax
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
a
deductible
as
you
say
in
either
event
by
the
employer.
justice
potter
stewart
including
the
employer's
taxes.
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
i
remember
now.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
an
option
on
the
part
of
the
husband
and
wife.
