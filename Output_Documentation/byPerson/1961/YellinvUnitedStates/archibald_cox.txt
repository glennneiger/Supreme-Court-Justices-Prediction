mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
deal
with
petitioner's
only
non-constitutional
claim.
one
that
he
was
not
obliged
to
answer
the
committee's
questions
because
the
committee
violated
its
own
rules,
its
act
of
questioning
witnesses
in
executive
sessions.
the
pertinent
facts
you
will
recall
are
these.
the
committee
has
a
rule
which
apparently
dates
back
to
1953
set
forth
on
page
82
of
our
brief.
if
a
majority
of
the
committee
or
subcommittee
duly
appointed
as
provided
by
rules
of
the
house
of
representatives,
believes
that
the
interrogation
of
a
witness
in
a
public
hearing
might
endanger
national
security
or
unjustly
injure
his
reputation.
the
committee
shall
interrogate
such
witness
in
an
executive
session
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
necessity
or
advisability
of
conducting
such
interrogation
thereafter
in
a
public
hearing.
pursuant
to
this
rule,
the
subcommittee
met
and
considered
whether
there
was
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
questioning
petitioner
in
a
public
session
might
endanger
the
national
security
or
unjustly
injure
his
or
another's
reputation
so
that
the
petitioner
should
first
be
preliminarily
questioned
in
an
executive
session.
the
commission
--
the
committee
decided
that
there
was
not
enough
reason.
mr.
archibald
cox
on
page
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
infer
that
from
the
statement
that
committee
met
--
it's
on
record
70.
the
committee
already
--
very
top
of
the
page,
the
committee
passed
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
would
hear
mr.
yellin
at
a
session
when
the
purpose
of
calling
him
was
discussed.
it
was
decided
that
the
rule
with
respect
to
an
executive
session
was
not
applicable.
i
take
it
also
there
is
nothing
explicit
that
says
we
apply
each
of
the
tests
in
the
rule.
it
says
it
was
decided
that
the
rule
was
not
applicable
and
i
would
think
that
was
enough
in
the
absence
of
anything
contrary.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
was
a
--
this
is
true.
it
is
also
true
that
he
was
being
asked
at
that
stage
a
general
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
then
it
--
then
he
goes
--
then
he
discusses
what
it
--
the
committee
usually
does
(voice
overlap)
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
but
i
suppose
that
it
could
be
argued
that
the
committee
did
hear
what
he
usually
did.
i
would
think
that
a
general
testimony
in
answer
to
a
general
question
was
really
less
persuasive
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
than
focusing
the
--
on
the
statement
that
we
decided
that
the
rule
was
not
applicable.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
sorry,
i
got
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they
said
that
the
--
the
reason
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
he
interrupted
his
train
of
thought
that
the
other
part
of
the
answer
is.
well,
his
story
was
that
the
man
was
a
known
communist.
that
he
had
been
active
in
international
conspiracy.
that
he
had
deceived
his
employer
and
so
forth.
i
think
that's
all
part
that
what
the
investigator
said
is
part
of
the
reason
that
the
former
employment
of
the
investigator,
except
perhaps
this
--
they
thought
that
added
to
his
reliability.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
it's
specific
that
that
was
all
he
could
recall.
it
certainly
is.
i
wasn't
able
to
follow
your
honor
exactly
because
i
was
still
back
on
page
70
because
i've
got
the
graph,
he
did
not
mention
this
reason.
i
would
think
so
far
as
that
goes,
that
the
committee's
own
interpretation
and
application
of
the
rule
was
to
be
given
very
great
weight
indeed
if
it
was
not
binding.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
committee
--
well,
i
think
that
it's
a
committee,
it's
a
rule
adopted
for
the
committee's
own
guidance.
it's
a
rule
which
purports
to
confer
no
rights
on
witnesses
any
way.
it's
a
committee
which
leaves
--
it's
a
rule,
excuse
me,
which
leaves
the
committee
of
the
very
widest
discretion.
in
each
instance,
it's
simply,
if
the
committee
believes,
it
should
--
that
these
things
would
happen,
there
they
should
hold
a
preliminary
statute.
we
think
three
--
to
summarize,
we
think
there
are
three
answers
to
this
contention.
one,
that
the
rule
was
satisfied.
second,
that
the
rule
confers
no
rights
upon
witnesses,
that
it
sets
up
no
procedure,
that
it
is
written
in
terms
guiding
the
committee's
discretion,
and
that
failure
to
follow
it
adds
nothing
to
the
witnesses'
rights.
third,
i
would
lay
stress,
more
stress
than
i
have
in
my
brief
perhaps
on
the
fact
that
the
objections
raised
by
the
witness
were
--
that
no
objection
was
raised
by
the
witness
on
the
ground
that
he
had
not
been
questioned
in
a
preliminary
executive
session.
on
the
contrary,
his
objections
under
the
fifth
amendment
--
under
the
first
amendment
and
the
lack
of
congressional
power
were
all
general
objections
which
would
be
equally
applicable
in
an
executive
session
or
in
a
public
session.
here
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
the
counsels
said
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
this
counsel
said
that
he
would
like
to
have
the
telegrams
in
the
record.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
then,
following
not
any
idiosyncrasies
of
congressman
walter
but
in
an
established
rule
of
that
committee,
counsel
was
reminded
that
all
counsels
were
permitted
to
do
in
that
committee
hearing
--
were
to
advise
witnesses
and
not
speak.
the
petitioner
at
that
stage
did
not
say
a
word
with
respect
to
a
desire
to
be
heard
in
executive
session.
it's
significant
i
think
too
that
the
petitioner
has
never
given
the
slightest
indication
that
he
would
testify
in
executive
session.
indeed,
his
request
for
the
executive
session,
his
objections
in
the
court,
his
objections
before
the
committee,
are
all
carefully
void
any
intimation
that
he
would've
been
test
--
willing
to
testify
under
any
circumstances.
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
travesty
now
to
set
aside
and
justify
his
refusal
to
answer
on
the
ground
of
which
so
far
as
we
can
tell
didn't
possibly
influence
his
conduct.
there
is
one
other
point
with
respect
to
the
rule
that
i
split
over.
the
telegrams
--
the
telegram
requesting
the
executive
session
was
addressed
to
committee
counsel.
it
arrived
very
late
after
the
committee
and
the
counsel
had
left
gary.
there's
nothing
in
the
rule
that
says
that
the
decision
must
be
made
on
the
request.
the
committee
had
made
it.
there
was
nothing
whatsoever
new
set
forth
in
the
request
and
the
staff
director,
i
infer
although
this
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
answered
mindful
of
the
committee's
private
--
previous
decision.
the
witness
undoubtedly
could've
raised
the
question
later
on
what
would've
happened,
of
course,
i
don't
know
and
neither
does
anyone
else.
i
think
that's
the
whole
case
on
that
point
and
that
i
should
now
proceed.
coming
to
the
constitutional
issues,
i
must
make
two
preliminary
remarks.
first,
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
refusal
of
a
particular
witness
to
answer
four
specific
questions
during
the
course
of
a
particular
congressional
investigation.
i
stress
the
point
because
petitioner's
reply
brief
complains
of
our
close
and
literal
attention
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
says
that
the
real
issue
is
what
the
petitioner's
calls
the
enormity
of
the
committee's
offense
against
the
american
people.
this
court,
i
need
hardly
say
sits
to
decide
particular
cases
and
we're
here
concerned
with
the
case
of
edward
yellin,
a
case
which
as
i
shall
argue
later
is
very
different
and
in
our
view
much
stronger
for
the
government
than
any
of
the
previous
cases
that
have
come
before
the
court
and
other
conceivable
cases
involving
the
committee's
activity.
the
rights
of
other
witnesses
not
to
answer
other
questions
under
other
circumstances
and
on
other
occasion
will
have
to
be
decided
when
those
questions
arise.
second,
i
must
emphasize
that
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
rightness
or
wrongness,
the
wisdom
or
folly,
the
necessity
or
superfluity
or
even
the
fairness
or
unfairness
of
the
committee's
action.
the
responsibility
for
legislating
is
vested
in
the
congress.
with
it
goes
the
power
and
duty
of
deciding
what
bills
should
be
considered.
what
information
should
be
obtained
and
how
it
should
be
obtained
in
order
to
frame
appropriate
legislation.
when
an
individual
asserts
that
the
congress
has
trespassed
on
one
of
his
individual
rights,
then
of
course,
this
court
has
the
constitutional
duty
of
deciding
between
the
two.
the
court
can
avoid
unseemly
conflict
and
avoid
upsetting
the
balance
of
our
constitutional
system
only
by
exercising
special
care
in
such
cases
in
marking
the
line
between
violation
of
constitutional
rights
which
the
courts
must
redress
and
simply
bad
judgment
in
the
exercise
of
legislative
power
which
is
remediable
only
in
congress
or
at
the
polls.
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
coming
down
directly
to
the
constitutional
merit,
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
require
affirmance
of
the
judgment.
barenblatt
against
the
united
states,
wilkinson
against
the
united
states,
braden
against
the
united
states
are
squarely
in
point,
that
these
--
this
is
an
easier
case
than
any
of
them.
petitioner
admits
these
constitutional
claims
he's
made
cannot
be
affirmed
or
accepted
without
overruling
those
decisions.
i'm
not
unmindful
that
occasionally
in
our
constitutional
history
exact
precedence
have
been
overruled.
this
--
and
appropriate
indeed
and
essential
when
the
inherited
law
has
lost
reality
or
changes
in
the
condition
and
the
community
has
altered
the
conditions
on
which
the
precedence
were
based.
and
so
that
today
the
precedent
would
have
a
different
social
or
economic
impact
than
at
the
time
that
it
was
decided.
the
present
case
obviously
does
not
fall
in
that
category.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
i
mean,
nothing
is
absolute
as
that,
justice
black.
i
think
that
is
a
relevant
circumstance,
a
highly
relevant
circumstance
in
deciding
whether
a
decision
should
be
overruled.
now,
i
was
simply
--
but
there
are
others.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
that
circumstance
is
not
applicable
here.
that
barenblatt,
wilkinson,
and
braden
were
recently
decided
by
a
full
court
after
careful
deliberation.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
have
been
--
there
have
been
instances
of
that.
the
two
cases,
two
situations
in
which
it
would
seem
to
me
that
overruling
a
case
came
easiest
was
where
there
were
changes
in
conditions
or
where
the
decision
was
an
isolated
peak
as
it
were
on
the
amendment.
neither
of
those
is
applicable
here.
barenblatt,
the
basic
postulate
of
barenblatt,
wilkinson,
and
braden,
that
the
communist
conspiracy
is
a
threat
to
the
national
security
into
which
government
may
inquire
in
concerning
which
it
may
legislate
and
why
is
not
applicable
to
ordinary
political
party
is
the
predicate
of
at
least
the
score
of
decisions
over
the
last
15
years.
and
barenblatt
and
the
cases
that
followed
it
were
preceded
by
decisions
in
the
lower
court
which
were
quite
uniformly
in
accordance
with
those
decisions.
now,
i
submit
with
the
greatest
deference
that
the
power
to
overturn
such
an
established
body
of
constitutional
law
without
any
relevant
changes
in
the
underlying
conditions
should
be
exercised
only
upon
the
clearest
conviction
of
a
very
serious
error
before
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
a
matter
of
degree
as
of
clarity.
the
degree
of
what
was
--
one
must
show
in
order
to
overrule
it,
i
presume
that
it
involves
too
--
consideration
of
the
arguments
on
the
--
the
reasons
not
to
overrule
the
decision.
for
i
point
out
with
all
respect
that
the
condition
which
is
indispensable
to
all
liberty
acceptance
of
the
rule
law
depends
on
preserving
the
principle
that
even
the
highest
court
must
give
judgment
not
simply
according
to
its
use
of
policy
however
just
or
wise
but
according
to
a
law
that
binds
the
courts
no
less
than
the
litigants,
the
judges,
no
less
than
the
judge
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
that
is
a
consideration
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
--
i'm
thinking
that's
true
but
there
are
--
there
are
times
when
a
court
decision
creates
a
rule
of
law
which
did
not
previously
exist
and
there
are
times
in
constitutional
law
where
the
line
between
law
and
policy,
evaluation
of
social
and
economic
conditions
become
exceedingly
binding
indeed.
if
i
imply
that
anyone
was
simply
trying
to
make
the
world
according
to
his
(inaudible),
i
had
no
--
no
such
intention.
i
do
mean
to
imply
that
there
are
weighty
considerations
on
the
side
of
adhering
to
an
established
body
of
decision
and
i
think
that
that
weight
is
the
greatest
when
one
does
not
have
in
favor
of
arguing
for
change,
either
the
fact
that
it's
an
isolated
decision
or
the
fact
that
the
underlying
conditions
have
changed.
mr.
archibald
cox
of
course.
coming
to
the
substantive
question,
in
our
view,
reason
and
principle
also
demonstrate
quite
apart
from
the
authority
that
the
use
of
compulsory
process
in
examining
petitioner
as
a
witness
before
the
congressional
committee
deprived
him
of
none
of
his
constitutional
right.
in
examining
this
question,
we
may
begin
with
the
proposition
that
it
said
along
that
congress'
power
to
use
compulsory
process
to
secure
information
in
aid
of
a
proper
legislative
purpose.
it
is
also
clear
beyond
dispute
on
this
record
that
the
questions
that
petitioner
was
directed
to
answer
were
asked
in
pursuance
of
a
proper
legislative
purpose.
the
committee's
purpose
was
set
forth
in
the
resolution
authorizing
the
hearings
in
gary
and
it
was
restated
by
the
chairman
at
the
start
of
the
hearing
in
the
presence
of
all
the
witnesses
including
the
petitioner.
without
reading
his
statement
at
length,
it
emphasized
that
the
committee
was
holding
the
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
testimony
concerning
communist
techniques
and
tactics
of
infiltration,
and
the
extent,
character,
and
objective
of
communist
party
activity
in
basic
industry.
he
then
went
on
to
refer
to
the
existing
laws
over
the
administration
of
which
the
committee
was
exercising
oversight
and
to
some
of
the
bills
and
kinds
of
bills
that
were
before
the
committee
at
the
time
the
hearing
was
held.
among
those
proposals
just
to
make
it
specific
that
there
was
legislation
to
which
this
inquiry
was
highly
relevant,
were
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
had
been
repealed.
hr
8151
which
proposed
to
amend
the
internal
security
act
by
setting
--
by
authorizing
the
secretary
of
defense
to
establish
a
system
of
security
around
defense
plants.
another
bill
introduced
by
congressman
shearer,
who
was
one
of
the
committee
conducting
the
hearing
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose
by
other
ways
and
various
proposals
to
amend
the
smith
act,
the
internal
security
act,
and
the
communist
control
act.
whatever
might
be
the
merits
of
any
particular
piece
of
legislation,
it
is
also
--
it
is
not
denied
in
this
case
at
least
that
congress
has
some
power
to
enact
some
legislation,
to
deal
with
infiltration
of
vital
defense
plants,
in
basic
industries
by
professional
revolutionaries
through
fraud
and
deception
for
the
purposes
of
a
foreign
dominated
conspiracy.
and
that
is
the
kind
of
conduct
that
the
record
shows
very
clearly
into
which
this
inquiry
was
being
conducted.
it's
also
plain
that
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
was
made
clear
to
the
petitioner.
he
acknowledged
that
he
was
present
when
the
chairman
made
his
statement
and
as
i
understand
it,
he
has
not
challenged
the
pertinency
seriously
in
the
lower
court
or
in
this
court.
it
follows
therefore
that
the
use
of
compulsory
process
was
a
lawful
exercise
of
legislative
power
unless
it
violated
some
constitutional
privilege
or
other
restriction
upon
the
congress.
petitioner's
claim
is
that
the
answer
violate
--
is
that
the
use
of
that
process
violated
the
first
amendment.
we
think
otherwise.
in
the
beginning,
it
is
plain
that
petitioner
is
not
being
prosecuted
because
of
any
statements,
any
publications,
or
any
associations.
he
is
being
prosecuted
because
of
a
refusal
while
under
subpoena
to
answer
the
inquiries
of
the
legislative
body.
the
use
of
compulsory
process
is
concerned
primarily
with
the
witness'
performance
of
the
normal
duties
of
all
citizens
to
furnish
information
needed
in
the
legislative
or
judicial
process.
second,
the
use
of
the
compulsory
process
did
not
in
itself
curtail
petitioner's
freedom
of
expression
or
association.
he
remains
free
from
any
governmental
compulsion
to
think,
speak,
or
form
such
associations
as
he
chooses.
nor
was
this
petitioner
being
tolerated
by
the
committee
because
of
any
past
statements
or
association.
being
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
he
has
never
made
any
past
public
statements
of
any
kind.
he
was
subpoenaed
because
he
apparently
could
give
information
needed
in
the
legislative
process.
he
does
not
even
claim
that
this
is
a
case
of
exposure
for
the
sake
of
exposure.
in
this
case,
we
submit,
in
this
respect
we
submit,
the
case
is
markedly
different
from
uphaus,
wilkinson,
and
braden
where
the
dissenting
justices
did
find
occasion,
that
did
find
that
the
occasion
for
calling
the
witnesses
was
their
public
criticism
of
the
committee.
there
is
nothing
like
that
present
here.
fourth,
the
committee's
questions
i
think
can
fairly
be
described
as
primarily
concerned
with
conduct
with
reported
infiltration
of
professional
revolutionaries
into
the
basic
steel
industry
concealing
their
background
and
identity
through
fraud
and
deceit
all
in
support
of
a
program
looking
forward
to
disruption
of
normal
trade
union
activities,
political
strikes,
or
sabotage,
or
espionage
as
might
be
directed
by
a
foreign
power.
undoubtedly,
the
questions
would
also
have
elicited
information
concerning
petitioner's
associations
and
beliefs
or
possibly
including
his
speech.
but
this
is
because
the
speech
and
associations
were
an
extra
complaint
intertwined
with
the
conspiracy
to
engage
in
conducts
subversive
of
bona
fide
unions
and
dangerous
to
the
national
security.
in
short,
the
petitioner's
only
complaint
here
when
one
analyzes
it
carefully
is
that
the
consequences
of
compelling
him
to
testify
about
conduct
might
result
in
disclosure
of
views
and
associations
sufficiently
unorthodox,
unpopular,
or
even
hateful
to
the
general
public
to
damage
him
and
perhaps
to
discourage
others
from
embracing
unorthodox
or
controversial
views
or
associations
in
the
future.
let
me
make
it
clear
that
i
do
not
suggest
that
those
consequences
raise
no
constitutional
issue.
of
course
they
do.
in
some
cases
they
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
use
of
compulsory
process
would
violate
the
first
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
my
only
point
is
that
in
this
case,
any
interference
with
freedom
of
association
as
an
indirect
consequence.
the
constitutionality
of
which
cannot
be
decided
without
taking
into
account
the
justification
for
requiring
the
disclosure.
let
me
take
a
moment
to
try
and
make
that
clear,
both
the
distinction
of
its
importance
by
a
simple
and
indeed
perhaps
trivial
example
what
i
think
it
illustrates
the
point.
suppose
that
a
man
is
on
trial
for
first
degree
murder
and
he
offers
an
alibi
to
the
effect
that
at
the
time
the
murder
was
committed
he
was
at
a
closed
meeting
of
the
top
members
of
the
john
birch
society.
the
defendant
subpoenas
me
as
a
witness
hoping
to
prove
through
me
that
he
was
at
that
meeting.
now,
if
i
am
compelled
to
answer
on
the
ground
overruling
my
claim
of
freedom
of
speech
or
freedom
of
association,
certainly
the
disclosure
of
the
secret
membership
in
the
john
birch
society
would
be
damaging
to
my
career.
i
assume
that
i
would
lose
the
pleasure
of
appearing
before
this
court
as
often
as
i
do,
i
doubt
that
i
should
be
welcomed
back
by
my
former
associates
with
much
enthusiasm.
others
who
observe
my
faith,
i
suppose
might
be
deterred
from
engaging
in
the
same
associations
at
least
under
the
same
circumstances.
nevertheless,
it
seems
fair
to
conclude
that
no
one
did
--
would
dispute
that
the
testimony
could
be
required.
that
the
interest
in
the
fair
administration
of
justice
would
prevail
over
my
interest
in
privacy
of
associations
and
that
it
would
add
nothing
to
the
argument
to
say
it
would
be
true
that
the
public
interest
in
my
associational
secrecy
so
that
others
might
be
--
might
feel
free
from
engaging
in
associations
would
also
be
sacrificed
to
some
extent.
now,
of
course
i
don't
say
that
the
present
case
is
identical
with
the
example.
my
point
to
repeat
it
is
that
the
effect
on
first
amendment
freedoms
in
the
present
case
is
indirect
and
consequential
as
in
my
example.
and
that
therefore,
one
cannot
dispose
of
the
present
case
simply
by
asking
whether
freedom
of
association
might
be
adversely
affected
by
requiring
the
testimony.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
intend
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
intend
to
--
i
intend
immediately
to
discuss
some
of
those
questions
as
i
do
deal
with
the
issue,
i
don't
attribute
any
particular
significance
to
balancing,
justification,
cogent
reasons
for
invading
the
privacy,
any
of
the
expressions
that
recognize
that
here
there
is
a
conflict
between
two
interests.
and
where
there
is
a
conflict
between
two
interests
as
so
often
in
the
law,
the
court
must
measure
the
one
in
the
light
of
the
other
and
determine
their
relative
importance.
the
point
stated
by
the
chief
justice
very
well
in
the
watkins
case.
it
is
manifest
after
pointing
out
the
effect
of
some
of
the
disclosures
that
might
be
compelled,
he
went
on
to
say.
it
is
manifested
despite
the
adverse
effects
which
followed
upon
such
compelled
disclosure
or
private
matters
not
all
such
inquiries
are
barred.
the
critical
element
is
the
existence
of
and
the
weight
to
be
ascribed
to
the
interest
of
the
congress
in
compelling
disclosures
from
an
unwilling
witness.
here,
the
public
interest
in
questioning
petitioner
lay
in
obtaining
for
legislative
purposes
information
concerning
putative
subversive
activities
in
a
vital
area
of
our
national
life.
the
information
if
the
reports
the
committee
had
withdrew
was
relevant
to
national
survival.
the
communist
party,
congress
had
previously
found,
also
purportedly
a
political
party
is
in
fact
an
instrumentality
of
a
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states.
the
policies
and
programs
of
the
communist
party
are
secretly
proscribed
for
it
by
foreign
leaders
of
the
world
communist
movement.
even
if
that
finding
were
not
supportive
by
convincing
proof,
certainly
there
would
be
the
strongest
reasons
for
inquiring
further
into
the
conduct
of
a
conspiracy
which
there
was
substantial
reason
or
indeed
any
reason
to
believe
might
be
being
manipulated
by
a
foreign
and
sometimes
hostile
power
for
treasonable
purposes.
nor
are
we
concerned
here
and
i
wish
to
emphasize
this
distinction
between
some
of
the
prior
case,
nor
are
we
concerned
here
with
a
general
inquiry
into
the
activities
of
the
communist
party,
the
committee
was
investigating
a
reported
program
for
infiltrating
highly
educated
rev
--
professional
revolutionaries
into
the
basic
steel
industry
by
concealment,
fraud
and
deceit.
and
then
by
having
the
communist
agents
pose
as
ordinary
workers
to
subvert
labor
unions
and
other
worker
organization
to
communist
purposes.
the
basic
steel
industry,
i
need
hardly
say
is
the
core
of
our
economy
in
time
of
peace
and
its
lifeblood
in
times
of
war.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
an
overstatement
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
record,
with
all
deference,
does
not
bear
it
out.
i
wonder
if
i
might
simply
finish
discussing
the
subject
into
which
the
committee
was
inquiring
and
then
deal
with
the
question
of
what
petitioner
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
have
had.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
let
me
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
intend
to
--
i
intend
to
find
out
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
let
me
--
let
me
discuss
the
reasons
for
calling
petitioner
now
then
if
i
may
and
then
i
will
come
back
to
the
national
importance
of
the
subject
that
the
committee
was
investigating.
petitioner
was
in
a
position
to
furnish
extraordinarily
accurate
and
pertinent
information
about
this
reported
conspiracy.
he
was
not
subpoenaed
as
the
result
of
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures.
the
committee
had
information
before
he
was
called
that
he
was
a
long
time
communist
party
member
who
had
actively
participated
in
the
party's
organization
of
the
steel
industry.
in
the
gary
area,
he
was
apparently
one
of
the
professional
revolutionaries
with
higher
education
whom
the
party
had
recruited
to
conceal
their
past,
pose
as
laborers
and
thus
gained
for
communist
purposes
key
positions
upon
the
workers
in
basic
industries.
his
education
and
this
long
experience
put
him
in
a
position
where
if
he
were
willing,
he
could
give
invaluable
information
upon
the
direction,
techniques,
and
purposes
of
the
program
of
colonization.
now,
it
is
said
that
although
the
committee
was
asking
questions
directed
to
that
very
program
of
action,
that
the
committee
had
all
the
information
it
could
possibly
use
on
this
point.
and
that
this
would
be
redundant
and
therefore
of
no
value
to
the
committee.
we
think
mr.
justice
douglas
that
there
are
two
complete
and
very
short
answers
to
that
argument.
in
the
first
place,
it
seems
to
us
to
have
no
foundation
in
effect.
we
can't
tell
what
petitioner
would've
said
since
he
refused
to
even
to
tell
where
he
lived
in
1949.
but
every
indication
in
the
records
shows
that
he
could've
contributed
in
part
for
the
testimony.
now
first,
at
the
time
petitioner
was
called,
there
was
no
witness
who
had
testified
about
communist
infiltration
in
the
steel
industry
in
gary,
indiana.
its
nonsense
i
think
to
say
that
testimony
about
what
happened
in
buffalo
or
some
place
in
the
fish
industry
down
in
north
carolina
or
in
the
auto
industry
in
flint
covered
this
subject
completely.
certainly,
a
conscientious
legislature
would
wish
to
know
the
extent
of
the
colonization
programs
in
terms
of
the
number
of
vital
industrial
plants
effect,
it
wish
to
know
its
intensity
in
terms
of
the
number
of
professional
revolutionaries
are
on
that
area.
and
he'd
wish
to
know
about
the
degree
of
its
success
or
failure.
if
the
evidence
convinced
him
that
the
conspiracy
was
ineffective
and
made
up
on
the
whole
of
rather
pathetic
or
radically
inclined
young
men,
he
might
conclude
that
the
wisest
fallacy
would
be
to
leave
them
alone.
if
the
evidence
showed
that
numerous
vital
steel
mills
were
affected
and
that
there
were
professional
revolutionaries
in
key
union
positions
of
each,
new
legislative
measures
might
be
deemed
appropriate.
petitioner's
testimony
covering
the
vital
gary
steel
mills
would've
thrown
important
new
light
on
those
methods.
second,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
we're
--
we're
dealing
with
questions
of
degree
here
as
i
recall
it,
like
the
privilege
in
self
--
against
self-incrimination
at
least
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
privilege
of
the
confession
is
absolute.
as
i
was
arguing
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
earlier,
the
right
to
privacy
of
association
seems
to
me
not
to
be
absolute.
the
second
point
on
which
yellin
could
give
new
and
important
information
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
think
that
in
this
case,
is
an
easier
case
from
the
government's
point
of
view
and
that
therefore
even
if
which
i
don't
suggest
for
a
minute,
barenblatt
were
wrong,
it
shouldn't
be
overruled
in
this
case.
i
think
this
an
exceedingly
strong
case
and
i
don't
mean
to
guess
any
aspersions
on
barenblatt.
but
i
think
one
could
disagree
with
barenblatt
and
both
to
affirm
in
this
case,
i
think
that's
quite
clear.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
this
is
even
more
than
the
field
of
communism,
i
think
justice
harlan.
this
is
a
--
this
is
in
a
vital
--
i
didn't
develop
that
part
of
my
argument,
but
this
is
in
a
vital
steel
mill.
it
also
isn't
a
--
in
an
--
which
has
been
a
tremendous
national
importance
and
i
needn't
relate
all
the
occasions
on
which
it's
been
a
tremendous
national
importance.
so
it
also
pertain
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
had
been
one
of
the
points
that
i
--
we
do
develop
in
our
brief
and
that
i
had
intended
to
develop
if
i
hadn't
gone
on
to
deal
with
what
petitioner
could
add.
it's
also
of
relevance
i
think
that
history
demonstrates
that
the
effect
of
these
activities
in
the
labor
movement
is
not
sheer
fantasy
that
there
is
a
--
have
been
a
number
of
occasion
early
during
world
war
ii
if
you
recall
it
justice
goldberg.
there
were
communist
strikes
in
north
american
aviation
and
in
allis-chalmers
in
milwaukee.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
that
these
are
very
real
in
this
industry
and
i
think
it
is
quite
different
in
those
respect,
from
education,
propaganda
activities,
those
are
different
cases
which
have
been
decided
and
we
are
(inaudible)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
doubt
--
i'm
afraid
i
don't
quite
understand
the
point
of
your
honor's
question.
how
would
i
distinguish
that
case?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
that
there
was
their
suggestion,
no
overriding
public
interest
in
the
information
sought
to
be
elicited.
that's
one
difference.
the
second
difference
is
that
there,
the
information
sought
to
be
elicited
as
i
understand
it
had
to
do
only
with
associations.
whereas
here,
the
effort
is
to
investigate
conduct
and
the
associations
come
in
collaterally
and
incidentally.
and
i
may
say
this
seems
to
me
also
to
be
true
of
the
florida
case
involving
the
naacp,
naacp
against
gibson.
that
--
and
of
course,
it
goes
without
saying
that
i
would
distinguish
between
the
conspiracy
to
infiltrate
bona
fide
unions
in
the
labor
movement
and
the
--
in
the
vital
steel
industry
is
altogether
different
from
the
activities
of
the
naacp.
now,
coming
back
to
the
question,
was
this
information
that
yellin
was
requesting
to
give
redundant?
i've
indicated
that
it
dealt
with
the
new
area
and
i
could've
dealt
with
it
in
a
degree
of
detail
and
in
a
more
vital
segment
of
industry
than
before.
it
also
have
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
area
of
gary,
it
had
very
little
about
the
steel
industry.
i
just
--
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
all
it
had
was
about
buffalo.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they
wanted
to
know
whether
he
was
in
gary
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
as
preliminary
matter
to
know
whether
he
could
give
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
the
record
shows
that
they
had
some
information
that
he
was
in
gary,
yes.
but
i
think
that
--
i
think
this
is
quite
clearly
a
preliminary
question,
the
questions
that
go
to
the
heart
of
the
inquiry
where
those
that
counts
two
and
four
are
based
on,
did
he
know
any
colonizers
in
the
steel
industry
in
gary
in
1957,
was
one,
and
the
other
related
to
the
colonizers
in
the
steel
industry
prior
to
1957.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
what
i
was
--
what
said
was
that
the
heart
of
the
inquiry
was
embraced
in
the
two
counts
that
i
just
mentioned,
that
the
one
that
dealt
with
where
he
lived
was
a
preliminary
question
which
would
normally
be
asked
a
witness
in
order
to
found
out
whether
he
could
give
this
more
vital
information
on
the
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
people
had
--
mr.
archibald
cox
people
--
well,
i'm
not
arguing
that
the
need
to
know
where
he
lived
justice
black
was
essential
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
to
support
that
count,
that
i
must
show
that
this
was
closely
related
and
preliminary
unto
the
subject
under
investigation.
if
you're
asking
a
man
what
he
knows
about
activities
in
gary,
it's
important
to
know
how
much
he
--
how
much
of
the
time
he
was
in
gary.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
people
have
been
--
people
have
been
--
i've
been
--
the
text
in
the
last
few
years
as
if
my
residence
was
a
place
where
it
wasn't,
this
is
in
--
may
be
erroneous
information.
mr.
archibald
cox
insofar
as
where
he
lived,
well,
yes.
the
other
part,
the
heart
of
the
inquiry
seems
to
me
to
have
gone
far
beyond
verifying.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
they
--
i
think
they
knew
that
they
didn't
know
as
much
in
this
instance.
i've
already
pointed
out
that
they
hadn't
had
any
testimony
directly
about
colonizing
in
gary
at
all.
i
would
like
to
add
that
they
didn't
have
any
testimony
about
activities
in
gary
either
then
or
later
after
1950
or
1952.
this
was
a
hearing
in
1957.
looking
to
--
or
early
1958,
looking
to
legislation
to
be
enacted
at
that
by
some
early
congress
of
manifestly
knowing
whether
these
efforts
had
continued
or
not,
or
whether
they
had
been
intensified
or
not
at
gary
would
be
highly
important
to
one
who
is
trying
intelligently
to
make
up
his
mind
on
this
precedent.
third,
as
your
honors
suggested,
the
witness,
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
could
have
given
information
on
this
point
in
a
great
deal,
more
detail
than
any
of
the
previous
witnesses
who
had
testified.
there
has
been
--
i
understand
that
no
colonizers,
they
were
called,
no
professional
revolutionaries
who
infiltrated
by
this
process
of
fraud
and
deceit
who
has
been
willing
to
testify
before
the
committee.
even
if
there
had
been
one
or
two,
here
was
one
which
could've
added
presumably
if
the
information
the
committee
previously
had
a
great
deal
about
the
way
these
activities
were
being
conducted.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me,
i
find
it
a
little
--
maybe
he
shouldn't
have
been
indicted
on
this
count,
but
i
find
it
little
startling
that
one
shouldn't
ask
the
witness
whether
he
was
there
at
the
scene
of
the
activities
he's
being
questioned
about.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
even
if
--
even
if
one
shouldn't,
this
was
--
this
conviction
carried
concurrent
sentences
and
the
--
to
sustain
it
on
any
one
count
would
of
course
sustain
or
require
affirming
the
judgment
below
and
that
counts
two
and
four
are
not
i
think
conceivably
open
to
the
objection
about
residence.
the
--
i've
stressed
already
the
degree
of
national
interest
in
knowing
about
this
program
in
its
most
basic
industry
and
in
the
--
one
of
the
handful
and
most
important
bill
in
its
most
basic
industry.
i've
also
sought
to
develop
that
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
to
the
sub
--
that
subject,
the
extent
to
which
it
was
pointed
out
to
the
witness
and
the
reason
to
believe
that
he
could
afford
new
information.
now,
there
is
one
other
answer
to
this
argument
about
new
information
that
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court.
it's
more
fundamental
so
it
doesn't
need
to
be
ruled
upon
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
whether
information
sought
by
a
congressional
committee
is
necessary
or
unnecessary
or
fruitless
or
useful
or
helpful
or
redundant
is
not
a
subject
for
a
judicial
determination
once
it
is
determined
to
be
impertinent.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
objective
of
the
committee
must
be
legislation.
the
information
sought,
as
i
just
said,
must
be
pertinent
to
that
objective.
there
must
i
assume
for
present
purposes
be
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
witness
has
the
pertinent
information
and
he
must
be
made
aware
of
its
pertinence.
the
public
importance
of
congress'
acquiring
pertinent
information
on
the
subject
under
investigation
must
also
justify
the
risk
of
damage
to
the
individual
liberties.
but
once
those
points
have
been
covered,
i
submit,
the
judicial
function
is
exhausted.
choosing
among
pertinent
lines
of
inquiry
deciding
when
the
ground
has
been
adequately
covered,
decide
--
relying
on
testimony
received
or
seeking
new
testimony
that
will
corroborate
or
disprove
the
testimony
already
received
are
all
parts
of
the
legislative
process.
no
one
can
tell
how
helpful
a
logically
material
bit
of
information
will
be
without
studying
and
drawing
inferences
from
the
information
you
already
have
and
ascertaining
the
other
potential
sources
of
information.
obviously,
the
line
that
an
investigation
takes
next
requires
some
judgment
as
to
what
are
the
most
likely
forms
of
legislation
and
how
will
the
congress
and
the
public
respond
from
the
legislative
process
to
the
information
already
adduced.
that
i
submit
although
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
our
case
rests
on
it,
is
a
test
for
the
law
made
and
that
the
court
should
not
undertake
and
substitute
its
judgment
of
theirs
once
the
basic
constitutional
requirements
that
i
had
listed
have
been
satisfied.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
information
to
the
interest
asserted
by
the
petitioner.
and
i
suggest
that
we
should
examine
it
very
carefully.
let
me
make
it
plain
that
when
i
talk
of
this
as
an
individual
interest,
that
we
fully
recognize
that
there
is
a
public
interest
in
individual
liberties
not
only
because
of
the
importance
of
the
individual
himself,
but
that
is
what
the
government
exist
for.
but
also
because
of
the
effect
of
the
example
on
others
and
because
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
freedoms
and
other
civil
liberties
is
of
course
important
to
the
community
as
a
whole.
exactly
stated,
the
in
--
only
interest
that
can
be
asserted
by
this
petitioner
is
secrecy
of
association.
indeed,
it's
fair
to
say
that
everything
indicates
that
the
--
his
claim
is
really
to
a
right
of
deception
concerning
his
association.
petitioner
was
not
subpoenaed
as
i
said
earlier
because
of
having
a
public
or
private
utterance.
he
was
not
subpoenaed
because
of
any
participation
in
an
open
assemblage.
the
information
in
the
possession
of
the
committee
indicated
that
petitioner
was
recruited
by
the
communist
party
to
conceal
his
true
beliefs
and
associations
and
then
by
false
representations
to
insinuate
himself
in
a
bona
fide
worker
organizations,
and
then
to
subvert
them
to
his
revolutionary
purposes.
the
interest
he
asserts
is
in
not
having
those
activities
known
to
the
public
so
that
he
and
others
may
feel
free
to
engage
in
them
in
the
future.
i
submit
therefore,
it
is
inaccurate
to
say
that
petitioner
is
simply
invoking
a
right
of
freedom
of
speech
or
freedom
of
public
assembly
or
association.
at
best,
his
claim
is
to
a
right
of
privacy
in
associations.
that
right
has
received
and
in
my
judgment
should
receive
constitutional
protection.
the
point
was
decided
in
naacp
against
alabama,
bates
and
little
rock,
shelton
and
tucker
and
other
cases.
there
are
two
reasons
however
for
concluding
that
the
right
to
secrecy
of
association
is
not
entitled
to
the
same
very
high
degree
of
protection
which
is
acknowledge
for
freedom
--
recognized
for
freedom
of
speech
are
open
in
public
assembly.
one
reason
for
a
deference
in
the
degree
of
constitutional
protection
is
that
the
reasons
for
the
special
protection
we
incurred,
the
freedom
of
speech
do
not
pertain
to
the
right
of
privacy
of
association.
the
other
is
that
the
asserted
freedom
to
conceal
one's
association
may
be
used
to
subvert
the
freedom
of
association
of
others.
let
me
develop
each
point
if
i
may
very
briefly.
first,
we
place
a
unique
constitutional
value
upon
freedom
of
speech
because
the
public
discussion
is
the
only
part
--
that
is
not
only
the
best
half
of
the
truth,
but
the
indispensable
condition
of
a
democratic
government.
the
best
corrective
for
error
in
thought
and
speech
is
more
thought
and
more
discussion.
we
pitched
our
constitutional
philosophy
upon
the
belief
that
men
who
have
the
chance
to
hear
all
sides
will
reach
the
wisest
and
best
decisions.
no
one
ever
stated
the
point
more
eloquently
than
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
his
separate
opinion
in
whitney
against
california.
i
would
like
to
take
time
to
read
a
lengthy
passage
which
states
the
ideas
i've
tried
to
condense,
time
forbids
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
he
winds
that
passage
up
saying,
“if
there
be
time
to
expose
through
discussion
the
falsehood
and
fallacies
to
avert
the
evil
by
the
processes
of
education,
the
remedy
to
be
applied
is
more
speech
not
enforced
silence”.
now,
petitioner
is
unwilling
to
stake
his
doctrine
on
such
intents
of
being
unwilling
to
suppress
--
to
subject
them
to
the
free
competition
of
ideas,
to
the
marketplace
of
ideas,
to
have
them
discussed,
known
they
didn't
--
have
them
known
and
publicly
discuss.
he's
not
in
a
position
to
claim
the
same
degree
of
individual
freedom
as
those
who
are
asserting
the
right
to
speak
openly
and
publicly.
second,
i
would
point
out
that
secrecy
or
privacy
of
association
is
susceptible
of
abuses
not
open
to
speech
or
open
public
assemblage.
it
can
be
used
not
only
to
protect
one's
own
freedom
of
association
but
to
destroy
or
subvert
or
mislead
the
associations
of
others.
there's
no
better
example
than
the
activities
of
the
communist
colonizers
described
in
the
present
record.
according
to
the
testimony
before
the
committee,
these
highly
educated
young
men
embraced
communism,
joined
the
party,
took
part
in
its
activities.
this
counsel
says
is
a
normal
--
is
an
exercise
of
the
normal
freedom
of
belief,
of
speech
and
association.
but
then
by
fraud
and
deceit,
they
were
to
gain
jobs
for
workers,
infiltrate
the
worker's
organizations
pretending
to
be
bona
fide
trade
unionists
but
in
fact
acting
for
a
foreign
power.
in
this
way,
the
asserted
cloak
of
privacy
would
become
a
method
of
deceiving
others
in
order
to
subvert
or
destroy
their
associations.
now
finally,
i
must
emphasize
the
point
made
from
the
beginning.
the
committee
was
not
investigating
speech,
thoughts,
or
political
associations.
it
was
investigating
conduct.
the
violation
of
any
privacy
of
beliefs
or
association
would
be
incidental
to
that
same
central
inquiry,
the
result
indeed
of
the
misuse
of
speech
and
association
to
further
a
conspiratorial
end.
judging
the
claims
of
petitioner's
right
and
giving
it
its
due
public
importance
against
the
importance
of
the
end
being
--
against
the
importance
of
the
inquiry,
the
importance
of
full
knowledge
upon
this
very
important
subject
of
infiltration
of
our
most
basic
industry,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
judgment
below
was
correct.
now,
i've
thus
far
not
dealt
with
two
of
the
arguments
that
were
presented
by
mr.
rabinowitz.
one
is
the
claim
that
the
statute
he
says
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
i
must
say
first
that
it
seems
to
me
that
any
question
about
the
vagueness
of
the
rule
--
of
rule
--
of
the
rule
constituting
the
un-american
activities
committee
was
clearly
disposed
of
in
(inaudible)
--
in
barenblatt.
as
i
read
on
page
122
after
a
long
discussion,
the
opinion
of
the
court
says,
“the
rule
cannot
be
said
to
be
constitutionally
infirmed
on
the
score
of
vagueness”.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
discuss
whether
congress
could
constitutionally
confer
this
authority
on
the
committee.
now,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
change
the
argument
to
say
that
we
are
looking
at
this
through
the
rule
of
dealing
with
--
in
behalf
of
congress.
second,
dealing
with
the
argument
on
its
merits,
the
petitioner
had
no
reason
to
doubt
what
it
was
that
he
was
required
to
do.
he
was
directed
to
answer
those
questions.
and
he
knew
that
if
he
failed
to
answer
the
question,
he
in
all
probability
would
be
charged
of
a
crime.
this
is
not
like
a
situation
that
one
can
argue
that
he
doesn't
know
what
his
legal
obligation
is.
his
legal
obligation
was
specifically
pointed
out
to
it.
the
argument
here
is
that
well,
we
challenged
the
authority
of
the
committee
to
require
that.
maybe
it
did
require
it
or
attempted
to
require
it
but
it
didn't
have
the
legal
authority.
it's
now
settled
that
it
did
had
the
legal
authority.
indeed
that
is
conceded
by
petitioner
and
i
would've
supposed
it
was
perfectly
claimed
that
whatever
be
the
exact
limits
of
the
committee's
authority,
that
there
was
no
doubt
about
its
authority
to
conduct
this
kind
of
investigation
into
this
kind
of
activity
and
this
by
industry.
the
other
argument
deals
with
the
failure
to
receive
professor
emerson's
testimony
in
answer
to
a
general
question
what
are
the
factual
considerations
and
values
that
we
should
take
into
account
in
resolving
the
basic
constitutional
issue
in
this
case.
it's
enough
to
say
that
the
difference
between
the
petitioners
and
ourselves
is
not
whether
professor
emerson's
views
should
be
taken
into
account,
but
how
should
that
kind
of
material
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
should
it
be
done
by
testimony
under
oath
or
should
it
be
done
in
the
normal
manner
by
briefs
or
by
the
citation
of
such
statements
in
law
review
article
by
the
court's
own
study
and
understanding,
by
reference
to
public
documents,
and
the
like.
its
enough
to
say
that
this
kind
of
question
dealing
with
the
basic
conditions,
the
basic
human
values,
if
you
will,
and
conditions
in
society
that
enter
into
the
determination
of
a
constitutional
question
have
always
in
our
constitutional
system,
have
been
decided
by
the
courts,
and
the
basis
of
such
knowledge
or
--
and
information
as
it
may
come
to
them
in
briefs
or
through
their
own
reading
and
prior
experience.
and
that
it
is
not
something
to
be
found
on
the
testimony
in
a
particular
record
with
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
particular
trial
judge
on
that
record
and
not
taking
into
account
anything
else
binding
upon
this
court.
certainly,
professor
emerson's
view
should
be
taken
into
account.
they're
in
the
record.
i
hope
the
court
will
read
them.
they're
an
excellent
illustration
in
my
view
of
how
easily
and
intelligent
man
could
miss
the
whole
point.
but
all
such
arguments
are
important
for
the
court
to
consider.
but
they
needn't
come
in
through
sworn
testimony
and
cross-examination,
so
that
we
submit
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
was
no
error
below
and
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'd
--
first,
i
would
not
understand
the
reference,
a
particular
circumstance
shown
to
refer
to
anything
other
than
the
inquiry
that
was
being
made
in
that
case
by
congress.
it's
objective.
that
of
course
can
be
shown
by
the
resolution.
the
kind
of
question
asked.
that
of
course
can
be
shown
by
the
testimony
or
in
most
of
these
cases,
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
before
the
committee.
and
that
particular
circumstance
means
the
sort
of
circumstance
i've
been
arguing
here.
knowledge
about
those
is
derived
on
the
part
of
the
court,
from
what
is
submitted
in
the
briefs.
i
would
think
that
it's
from
the
general
reading
on
the
part
of
the
court.
it
is
derived
from
a
public
documents
of
the
same
kind
--
sort
of
information
that
comes
to
the
attention
of
the
court
whether
it
decides
a
large
number
of
legal
question
which
are
based
on
underlying
appraisal
of
the
conditions
in
the
community.
let
me
take
an
unconstitutional
example
which
has
been
settled
but
at
one
time
was
litigable.
i
have
in
mind
the
case
of
glass
against
ickes
where
the
question
was
whether
the
secretary
of
interior
should
have
an
absolute
privilege
to
make
statements
about
people
doing
business
before
the
interior
department
no
matter
how
much
it
might
injure
that
man's
reputation.
now,
to
decide
whether
to
recognize
such
a
privilege
requires
a
judge
to
have
a
view
about
government,
about
the
importance
of
freedom
of
expression
on
the
part
of
government
officials
and
of
course,
a
view
about
the
knowledge
of
the
kind
of
harm
that
such
statements
may
do
to
the
one
who
is
defamed.
but
that
kind
of
understanding
about
the
impact
in
the
community
has
never
in
the
law
i
think
been
decided
by
calling
witnesses
to
testify
on
the
particular
record.
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
that
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
for
our
purposes,
the
only
thing
that
needs
to
be
determined
is
not
whether
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
communist
party
is
dominated
by
a
foreign
power
but
whether
con
--
the
congress
has
sufficient
foundation
for
believing
that,
to
make
this
subject
pertinent
to
inquire
into.
the
power
would
exist
whether
it
is
true
as
a
fact
or
simply
whether
it
was
basis
for
inquiring
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
wouldn't
think
that
issue
was
opened
in
a
court,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
take
it
that
the
court
--
i
take
it
that
there
must
be
some
reasonable
foundation
for
the
congressional
belief
just
as
there
are
again
the
--
i
am
taking
the
example
or
field
from
this
particular
case
because
it
might
clarify
our
reasoning.
i
suppose
that
if
a
state
legislature
would
pass
a
statute
that
required
every
homeowner
to
cut
down
all
his
maple
trees,
that
it
wouldn't
be
opened
to
--
would
normally
be
tried
out
in
a
courtroom
whether
maple
trees
like
cedar
trees
harbored
an
insect
which
would
just
--
which
would
damage,
if
not
destroy,
an
important
crop
like
the
apple
crop.
that
the
question
is
whether
the
legislature
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
reaching
such
conclusion
and
that
has
been
best
proved,
as
your
honor
knows,
best
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
through
materials
like
a
brandeis
brief.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
quite
proper
for
the
district
judge
to
take
that
position
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
the
important
question
is
really
whether
it
comes
in
by
testimony
or
not.
let
me
make
it
clear,
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
accept
professor
emerson's
statement
as
professor
emerson's
opinion
and
belief.
we'd
--
i
would
stipulate
that
here
now
that
we
accept
it
as
his
opinion
and
belief
and
we
will
accept
further
that
cross-examination
wouldn't
have
shaken
his
opinion
and
belief.
the
question
is
whether
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
they
disputed
that
below.
i
don't
think
it
was
ever
made
quite
that
explicit
but
i
think
that
the
whole
conduct
was
consonant
with
that
being
their
position.
the
question
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
not
that
if
--
if
they
took
the
position
that
it
bar
on
a
question
to
be
decided
by
the
court,
and
therefore
and
it
was
not
properly
put
in
by
way
of
sworn
testimony.
now,
i
think
really
the
critical
question
i
am
suggesting
is
not
so
much
whether
the
court
will
accept
the
sworn
testimony
but
whether
the
court
is
to
be
limited
to
findings
concerning
these
ultimate
values
based
on
sworn
opinion
and
testimony.
and
that
the
critical
question
is
whether
this
court
is
going
to
be
based
--
limited
by
the
opinions
of
those
who
saw
and
heard
the
witnesses
as
to
which
they
believed
and
which
they
didn't
believe.
and
i
submit
that
that
would
be
totally
at
odds
with
our
entire
constitutional
history
as
well
as
an
exceedingly
cumbersome
and
i
think
unwise
process.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
have
asked
--
your
honor
i
have
--
i
would
prefer
not
to
take
a
position
of
that
but
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
haven't
studied
it
myself
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
is
a
question
that's
involved
in
cases
before
this
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
sorry
i
haven't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
have
it
from
--
we
haven't
thought
about
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
what
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
if
your
honor
compare
with
me,
it'd
be
unwise
for
me
to
express
something
about
which
i
have
no
intelligent
thoughts
at
the
moment
in
which
it
does
all
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
come
before
the
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
without
directing
myself
to
that,
i
should
acknowledge
that
this
is
sometimes
a
question
of
degree.
i
recalled
that
the
first
time
i
was
ever
in
this
courtroom
dealt
with
the
constitutionality
of
certain
litig
--
certain
legislation
pertaining
to
the
bill.
and
there,
the
case,
the
economic
fact
had
been
tried
out
with
great
detail
before
a
master.
finally
they
were
stipulated
by
a
counsel
and
no
doubt
that
gave
the
court
a
picture
of
the
industry
which
would
not
otherwise
been
available.
but
i
don't
think
anybody
argued
that
the
ultimate
judgment
as
to
the
weight
of
various
interests
involved,
because
that
was
an
economic
case
was
to
be
made
by
the
master
finding
--
making
findings
of
fact.
the
constitutional
facts
are
facts
which
this
court
must
determine
for
itself
from
whatever
sources
seemed
best
to
it.
and
as
i
said
before,
we
certainly
would
think
that
professor
emerson's
views
--
he's
a
distinguished
professor,
should
be
taken
into
account.
we
hope
the
opposing
view
as
well
his
will.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that's
a
question
to
be
tried
out
in
the
evidence
in
each
particular
constitutional
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
no,
your
honor.
i
said
i
didn't
think
that
they
were
appropriate
to
be
tried
out
in
the
evidence
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
here
--
here
we
are
--
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
propriety
of
congressional
action
and
the
facts
in
the
first
instance,
the
reason
to
make
this
inquiry
in
the
first
instance
was
up
for
congress
to
determine.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
add
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
--
we're
determining
in
what
manner
his
defense
shall
be
made.
of
course
he's
entitled
to
make
a
defense
for
himself.
we're
discussing
whether
those
facts
which
go
into
deciding,
whether
requiring
him
to
answer
this
question
was
constitutional
are
to
be
established
on
the
basis
of
opinion
testimony
and
only
opinion
testimony,
i
take
it,
which
if
one
followed
that,
would
require
the
court
like
he
emphasized
to
follow
the
opinions
on
the
value
of
free
speech
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
i
think
that
is
not
an
appropriate
way
of
deciding
constitutional
issues.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
all
he
did
was
read
the
newspapers.
he
testified
that
this
came
from
a
file
or
clippings
of
magazine
articles
that
he
collected.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
there's
two
answers.
one,
is
that
it
is
to
a
degree,
the
duty
of
this
court
to
keep
abreast
and
social
problems
and
condition,
and
of
the
facts
that
go
into
them
equally
of
history
and
the
like.
that's
one
reason
that
it's
such
an
arduous
job.
i
think,
two,
the
point
i
made
earlier
is
highly
relevant
here
that
the
question
of
fact,
how
many
communists
are
there
is
not
a
question
to
be
tried
out
in
this
proceeding
for
contempt.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
question
is
whether
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
question
that
is
relevant
for
constitutional
purposes
is
whether
congress
had
before
it
sufficient
information
to
justify
its
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
a
highly
important
subject
for
it
to
investigate.
and
one
ascertains
what
congress
had
or
might
have
had
before
it
the
same
way
one
ascertains
whether
there
is
a
justification
for
legislation
fixing
the
price
of
milk
or
legislation
requiring
the
cutting
down
of
cedar
trees
or
the
leaving
of
coal
pillars
in
a
--
when
a
coal
mine
is
dug
in
the
(inaudible)
region,
and
the
like.
these
questions
have
never
been
done
by
exact
testimony
and
i
emphasize
the
court
being
limited
to
that
exact
testimony,
sometimes
the
testimony
may
be
helpful.
if
it
is
helpful
and
not
confining,
then
the
thing
to
do
with
this
case
is
to
read
it
and
take
it
into
account.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
