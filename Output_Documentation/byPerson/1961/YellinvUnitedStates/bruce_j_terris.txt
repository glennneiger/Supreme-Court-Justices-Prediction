mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
start
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
state
the
government's
basic
position
and
the
most
important
issues
in
all
three
of
the
contempt
of
congress
cases
which
are
being
argued
today.
these
basic
issues
are,
first,
whether
the
questions
which
were
asked,
the
petitioners
were
in
law
of
pertinent
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
second
basic
issue
is
whether
the
petitioners
were
apprised
of
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
which
they
were
asked
to
the
subject
under
inquiry
at
the
time
that
they
appear
before
the
committee.
the
third
basic
question
is
whether
the
committee's
questioning
of
petitioners
violated
their
rights
under
the
first
amendment
and
the
fours
--
fourth
basic
question
is
whether
the
committee's
inquiry
had
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
the
government
submits
that
all
four
of
these
questions
are
squarely
controlled
by
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
barenblatt,
braden,
and
wilkinson
cases.
in
fact,
petitioners
in
their
briefs
and
petitioner
yellin
here
in
oral
argument,
seems
to
agree
at
least
as
to
the
controlling
principles.
while
petitioners
indicate
disagreement
with
those
cases,
they
accept
their
applicability
and
argue
that
the
particular
facts
of
these
cases,
the
cases
which
are
now
before
the
court
dictate
a
different
result.
and
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
issue
which
is
before
the
court,
both
as
to
pertinency
and
as
to
the
first
amendment
is
whether
the
particular
facts
make
these
cases
distinguishable
from
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson.
it's
the
government's
position
that
the
cases
which
are
now
before
the
court
are
substantially
similar
on
their
facts
to
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
and
insofar
as
the
facts
are
different,
that
the
cases
which
are
now
before
the
court
are
considerably
stronger
for
the
government.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
this
particular
case,
the
yellin
case.
the
committee
at
the
time
the
petitioner
appeared
before
it
was
conducting
an
investigation
of
communist
activity
in
basic
industry
and
particularly
the
steel
industry
in
the
gary,
indiana
area.
the
committee
had
considerable
information
of
a
major
effort
of
the
communist
party
to
colonize,
that
is
to
infiltrate
basic
industry
throughout
the
united
states
and
more
specifically,
to
colonize
the
steel
industry
in
the
gary,
indiana
area.
petitioner
yellin
was
convicted
for
refusing
to
answer
four
questions,
although
he
refused
to
answer
considerable
number
more.
the
first
question
on
which
petitioner
was
convicted
was
where
he
resided
prior
to
september,
1957.
the
committee
explained
that
this
question
was
designed
to
establish,
the
petitioner
had
lived
in
the
gary
area
and
that
therefore
he
would
likely
have
knowledge
of
communist
activities
in
that
area.
the
second
question
on
which
petitioner
was
convicted
was
whether
he
knew
of
communist
party
colonization
in
steel
unions
in
the
gary
area
before
1957.
the
third
question
was
whether
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
on
june
23rd,
1949,
which
was
the
date
that
he
applied
for
employment
at
the
steel
mill
in
the
gary
area.
and
the
fourth
question
on
which
petitioner
yellin
was
convicted
was
whether
there
were
communist
party
colonizers
in
the
steel
unions
in
gary
in
1957.
and
therefore,
all
the
questions
on
which
petitioner
was
convicted
involved
with
petitioner's
own
communist
party
activities
or
that
--
or
communist
party
activities
generally
in
the
steel
industry
in
gary.
the
petitioner
here
on
my
petitioner's
prominent
silver
does
not
raise
any
issue
as
to
pertinency.
he
does
not
claim
that
the
questions
which
he
refused
to
answer
were
not
in
law
of
pertinent
to
the
subject
under
inquiry
nor
does
he
claim
that
the
committee
failed
to
apprise
him
of
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
petitioner
yellin's
major
contention
is
that
the
committee's
questioning
of
him
violated
his
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
as
petitioner
admits
his
basic
arguments
that
the
committee
had
no
valid
legislative
purpose
and
that
his
first
amendment
rights
were
violated,
were
answered
by
this
court
in
barenblatt,
in
braden,
and
in
wilkinson.
however,
petitioner
says
that
his
case
is
different
because
here,
the
private
interest
of
the
petitioner
in
silence
outweighs
the
governmental
interest
of
the
committee
in
compelling
him
to
answer.
this
court
in
the
barenblatt
case
emphasized
the
great,
the
overriding
governmental
interest
in
protecting
the
national
security
from
go
--
from
communist
subversion
and
this
determination
did
not
standalone.
it
reflected
of
series
of
earlier
decisions
such
as
the
dennis
case
which
upheld
portions
of
the
smith
act,
american
communications
association
versus
douds
which
upheld
the
non-communist
oath
provision
of
the
taft-hartley
act
as
well
as
numerous
other
cases
in
addition
reflected
the
detailed
findings
of
the
congress
in
section
2
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act.
in
barenblatt,
this
court
found
that
this
obviously
vital
governmental
interest
in
preventing
subversion
justified
an
investigation
by
the
very
same
committee
which
is
involved
in
this
case
into
communist
activities
in
educational
institutions.
and
in
wilkinson
and
braden,
this
court
held
that
the
governmental
interest
in
protecting
against
subversion
justified
this
committee
in
investigating
communist
propaganda
activities.
comparing
the
situation
which
was
before
the
court,
the
situations
which
was
--
were
before
the
court
in
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
to
this
case,
the
governmental
interest
here
is
considerably
stronger
both
education
and
propaganda
are
of
course
areas
particularly
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
here
on
the
other
hand,
the
committee's
investigation
was
at
--
was
in
the
field
of
basic
industry
and
particularly
to
steel
industry
which
is
certainly
less
directly
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
in
addition,
while
it
was
reasonable
for
congress
to
believe
that
the
danger
from
communist
subversion
was
substantial
in
education
and
propaganda.
certainly,
the
danger
there
was
at
less
direct
to
the
national
security
in
communist
activity
in
basic
industry.
in
fact,
it
has
been
recognized
for
40
years,
as
it
is
reflected
in
this
court's
decision
in
american
communications
association
versus
douds
that
one
of
the
most
important
steps
used
by
communist
to
subvert
democratic
governments
is
to
infiltrate
and
control
labor
within
basic
industry.
certainly,
the
congress
could
reasonably
believe
that
such
attempts
by
communist
in
the
united
states
presented
a
substantial
danger
which
should
be
investigated
at
the
least,
and
if
found
necessary,
legislated
against.
this
court
in
barenblatt
also
pointed
to
three
other
considerations
besides
the
danger
of
subversion
in
balancing
the
governmental
and
individual
interest
which
were
there
at
stake.
first,
the
court
in
barenblatt
noted
that
the
committee
was
not
attempting
to
pillory
mr.
barenblatt
and
this
is
equally
true
here.
committee
made
a
considerable
effort
to
persuade
petitioner
to
testify
and
even
explained
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
to
him
despite
the
fact
that
he
made
no
specific
objection
on
the
grounds
of
lack
of
pertinency.
second,
this
court
emphasized
that
mr.
barenblatt
had
not
been
subpoenaed
as
a
result
of
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures,
lacking
in
probable
cause
for
belief
that
he
possessed
information
which
might
be
helpful
to
the
subcommittee.
and
again,
this
is
equally
true
here.
two
persons
identified
petitioner
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
these
were
live
persons.
this
did
not
come
from
the
files
of
the
committee
including
francis
crawley
who
identified
petitioner
as
a
fellow
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
university
of
michigan
at
the
very
same
hearing
that
francis
crawley
similarly
identified
mr.
barenblatt.
and
finally,
this
court
in
the
barenblatt
case
said
that
the
relevancy
of
the
questions
is
not
open
to
doubt
and
this
is
even
more
clear
in
this
case.
petitioner
was
repeatedly
told
that
the
committee
was
investigating
communist
activity
and
basic
industry
in
the
gary,
indiana
area.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
it
did.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
not
in
--
it's
not
in
the
--
it's
not
in
the
--
in
the
record.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
in
the
petition
sir.
it's
287
f.2d
292,
287
f.2d
292.
and
finally,
this
court
said
in
the
barenblatt
case,
the
relevancy
of
the
question
is
not
opened
to
the
doubt
and
as
i
have
said
that
this
is
equally
true
here.
petitioner
was
told
specifically
of
the
subject
under
inquiry
and
the
questions
he
refused
to
answer
your
concerned
is
on
communist
party
activities
or
communist
party
activities
in
the
steel
industry
in
gary.
petitioner,
however,
claims
that
this
case
is
different
from
barenblatt
because
the
committee
had
all
the
information
on
communist
activities
which
petitioner
could
possibly
have
supplied.
petitioner
contends
that
the
committee
knew
where
petitioner
reside
it
before
1957
and
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1949
which
was
the
question
sought
in
the
--
which
was
--
which
was
the
information
sought
in
the
questions
underlying
counts
one
and
three.
and
petitioner
further
claims
that
the
committee
knew
from
previous
hearings
concerning
communist
activities
and
basic
industry,
the
answers
to
the
questions
involved
in
count
2
and
4.
therefore,
petitioner
argues
the
committee
wanted
only
collab
--
collaboration
which
does
not
outweigh
the
individual
interest
in
silence.
the
government
submits
the
petitioner's
first
mistake
in
this
argument
is
a
considering
only
the
information
which
was
sought
from
the
particular
questions
on
which
petitioner
was
convicted.
the
answer
to
anyone
question
or
even
any
four
questions,
they
will
not
be
vitally
important
to
the
committee's
investigation.
in
order
to
determine
the
interest
of
the
government
in
disclosure,
one
must
weigh
the
purpose
of
the
entire
investigation
in
the
communist
activities
in
the
steel
industry
and
the
possibility
that
the
witness
can
contribute
to
this
investigation.
and
therefore
in
the
barenblatt
case,
this
court
weigh
the
government's
--
the
committee's
interest
in
communist
infiltration
and
education,
not
the
interest
of
the
government
in
obtaining
the
answers
to
the
particular
questions
on
which
mr.
barenblatt
was
convicted.
petitioner's
second
mistake
is
in
ignoring
the
important
governmental
interest
and
having
a
well-informed
witness
confirmed
previous
information
particularly
when
the
existing
evidence
is
in
a
controversial
area
as
this
one
certainly
is,
and
is
therefore
likely
to
be
challenged.
the
questions
which
this
court
upheld
in
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson,
all
sought
information
concerning
whether
the
witness
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
to
collaborate
evidence
of
the
committee
already
had
in
all
three
cases
that
the
witness
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
in
addition,
it
is
clear
that
the
committee
was
not
merely
seeking
in
the
questions
involved
in
counts
2
and
4
to
confirm
evidence
that
it
already
had.
the
previous
committee
hearings
concerning
communist
activities
in
basic
industry
and
more
specifically
in
the
steel
industry
concerned
different
although
related
subjects
to
the
subject
of
communist
activities
in
the
gary
area
for
those
hearings
all
involved
communist
activity
and
basic
industry
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
for
example,
the
buffalo
hearings
concerned
communist
activity
and
basic
industry
in
the
buffalo
area.
the
committee
therefore
could
have
a
valid
interest
in
seeing
whether
the
pattern
which
was
established
in
buffalo
also
apply
throughout
the
rest
of
the
united
states
and
that
therefore,
legislation
might
be
necessary.
the
record
also
shows
that
the
committee
had
little
or
no
information
of
communist
party
activities
in
gary
after
1952
from
other
witnesses
and
did
it
hope
to
obtain
this
information
from
petitioner.
at
the
least,
petitioner
has
never
shown
that
he
could
not
have
provided
new
information
and
certainly
cannot
unilaterally
determine
that
he
had
no
new
information
and
that
therefore,
he
need
not
testify
before
a
properly
authorized
congressional
committee.
petitioner
yellin
also
claims
that
his
case
is
different
from
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
because
here,
the
trial
court
excluded
the
proffered
expert
testimony
of
professor
emerson
on
the
issue
whether
petitioner's
first
amendment
rights
had
been
violated.
this
testimony
is
included
in
full
in
the
record
at
pages
100
to
115
and
was
in
response
to
the
following
question.
everyone
opinion
as
to
the
various
factual
considerations
which
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
balancing
the
competing
public
and
private
interest
at
stake
in
the
circumstances
presented.
the
trial
court
held
that
this
question
asked
for
an
involved
legal
opinion
and
that
professor
emerson's
answer
constituted
such
a
legal
opinion.
without
going
into
professor
emerson's
lengthy
response
in
detail
and
then
to
summarize
at
pages
28
to
30
of
our
brief,
we
submit
that
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
which
was
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
the
proper
testimony
consisted
largely
of
legal
factors
which
the
court
should
consider
not
with
factual
evidence
relating
to
those
factors.
professor's
emerson
state
--
professor
emerson's
statement
in
short
reads
by
the
closing
argument
of
very
able
counsel
summarizing
his
client's
legal
position
under
the
first
amendment.
in
fact,
your
honor
it
does
--
parts
of
itself
considerably
like
mr.
rabinowitz's
closing
remarks
here
today,
while
such
statement
it
is
of
course
proper
when
presented
by
counsel
is
legal
argument,
the
lower
courts
will
correct
and
it
did
not
constitute
evidence.
but
even
if
we
are
wrong
and
the
lower
courts
are
wrong
and
professor
emerson's
testimony
was
properly
admissible,
we
submit
petitioner's
conviction
and
nevertheless
should
not
be
reversed.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
assume
your
honor
that
that
kind
of
testimony
would
go
to
the
question
whether
--
whether
the
particular
documents
were
obscene
not
on
the
--
not
on
the
standards
which
should
be
applied
by
the
court
here
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor
and
i
--
and
i
assume
that
is
a
--
is
a
factual
question.
i
don't
think
that
this
--
that
the
question
professor
emerson
testified
to
is
the
same
that
what
--
what
he
stated
was
quite
similar
to
--
if
you
put
the
majority
opinion
in
barenblatt
next
to
the
dissent,
his
testimony
once
--
he
first
deals
basically
with
the
majority
position
that
there's
a
great
danger
to
the
national
security
from
communist
subversion
and
then
it
goes
down
the
line
at
the
dissent
that
the
interest
of
the
individual
in
silence
is
greater.
i
don't
think
that's
the
same
type
of
issue
which
was
involved
in
the
obscenity
case.
but
even
if
there
was
admissible,
the
government's
further
argument
is
this
--
that
petitioner
yellin's
contention
should
anyway
be
sustained
but
the
testimony
was
offered
solely
concerning
petitioner
yellin's
claims
under
the
first
amendment.
and
this
was
a
legal
issue
which
this
court
in
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
decided
for
itself
and
therefore,
this
court
itself
consider
professor
emerson's
statement
which
is
fully
set
fort
in
the
record
to
determine
if
petitioner
yellin's
first
amendment
rights
were
actually
violated.
and
if
we
so
consider
professor
emerson's
statement,
a
fair
summary
is
that
a
danger
of
--
that
the
danger
from
the
communist
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government
is
not
substantial
but
the
threat
to
first
amendment
rights
from
congressional
inquiries
in
the
communist
activities
is
extremely
serious.
we
submit
that
this
statement
adds
nothing
to
the
competing
considerations
waived
by
this
court
in
barenblatt,
in
dennis
and
american
communication
association
versus
douds.
and
therefore,
we
submit
that
professor's
--
professor
emerson's
statement
presented
no
basis
for
changing
this
court's
determination
in
the
earlier
cases.
the
congressional
committees
can
compel
witnesses
to
testify
concerning
communist
activities
without
violating
the
first
amendment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
that's
right.
and
of
course
in
all
these
cases,
the
basic
first
amendment
rights
having
considered
by
this
court
is
a
question
of
law.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
i
would
--
i
wouldn't
like
to
say
that
it's
done
for
all
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
if
petitioners
can
show
that
there
is
any
difference
today
from
what
from
--
as
to
the
factors
--
from
the
factors
which
this
court
considered
in
barenblatt,
only
two
and
a
half
years
ago
that
--
that
is
one
thing,
but
that
is
not,
that
is
not
what
professor
emerson
testified
to.
he
basically
testified
to
what
the
court
should
consider.
now,
this
court
already
held
in
barenblatt
what
--
what
our
lower
courts
could
--
should
consider.
in
addition,
his
testimonies
almost
and
precisely
the
same
time
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
this
court
is
doing
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
you
--
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
balancing
process?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
the
way
the
government
sees
the
relationship
between
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
on
the
one
hand
and
any
city
in
alabama,
shelton
and
tucker,
bates
and
little
rock
and
the
other
which
all
involved
the
balancing
testing,
came
out
different
ways.
is
that
court
held
in
barenblatt
that
there
was
great
danger
from
subversion
from
communism?
and
the
questions
as
the
communism
could
be
asked
because
of
the
overwriting
governmental
interest
in
that
subject.
on
the
other
hand,
an
n.a.a.c.p.in
alabama,
in
bates
and
little
rock,
this
court
that
found
there
was
no
interest
of
the
state
in
finding
out
the
membership
list
of
the
--
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
and
in
shelton
and
tucker,
this
court
found
that
there
wasn't
--
there
wasn't
sufficiency
in
--
sufficient
interest
to
find
out
the
membership
of
teachers
in
all
their
organizations.
now,
it's
interesting
in
shelton
and
tucker,
this
court
carefully
said
that
it
was
not
deciding
that
a
state
couldn't
ask
questions
of
teachers
concerning
their
membership
in
certain
organizations
or
they
could
--
that
the
state
was
not
precluded
from
asking
from
certain
teachers
their
membership
in
all
organizations.
now,
if
--
the
government
submits
that
what
these
cases
altogether
show
is
that
when
the
--
when
a
committee,
when
the
state
or
federal
government
is
investigating
something
is
serious,
is
communist
subversion
that
the
governmental
interest
outweighs
the
private
interest.
now,
if
the
question
that
was
asked
was
so
clearly
on
its
face
unrelated
to
anything
to
do
with
communist
activity,
i
suppose
that
there
would
be
unconstitutional
to
ask
the
question,
although
it
probably
also
not
be
pertinent.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
the
answer
is
no.
this
court
in
barenblatt's
gave
three
considerations
which
have
to
be
applied
in
each
individual
case.
one
of
the
considerations
was
whether
the
witness
was
called
as
a
result
of
dragging
and
procedures.
i've
arg
--
well,
i
assumed
that
there's
no
absolutely
no
basis
that
can
believe
it
he
has
any
information
about
the
subject
under
inquiry.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
i
--
i
think
that
is
the
meaning
of
what
--
of
what
this
court
said
in
the
barenblatt
case
and
is
repeated
substantially
in
those
terms
in
both
braden
--
both
braden
and
wilkinson
that
mr.
barenblatt
was
not
subpoenaed
as
the
result
of
it
and,
“indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures
lacking
and
probable
cause
for
belief
that
he
possess
information
which
might
be
helpful
to
the
subcommittee.”
now,
applying
that
standard,
if
a
witness
was
just
called
off
the
street,
they
had
no
--
no
indication
that
he
had
any
information
about
communist
activity
in
the
particular
communist
activity
which
the
committee
was
investigating
then
i
think
this
would
probably
violate
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
two
other
considerations
which
are
in
barenblatt;
one
is
that
whether
the
committee
was
attempting
to
pillory
the
witness
and
another
one
was
whether
the
questions
were
relevant.
now,
i've
argued
that
it
--
in
this
case
as
in
the
other
two
cases,
all
three
of
these
standards
are
met.
and
then
i
--
the
government
submits
that
if
they
are
met
then
as
your
honor
suggesting
this
question
that
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
establish
that
the
committee
can
compel
a
witness
to
answer
questions
which
are
pertinent.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
first
of
all
i
think
those
three
considerations
have
the
basic
equities.
i
don't
know
of
–-
of
other
equities
that
should
be
weighed
and
–
and
second
of
all,
i
think
the
–-
the
basic
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yellin.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
would
think
that
would
be
pillorying
the
witness.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
would
be
pillorying
the
witness.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
now,
the
barenblatt
case
doesn't
go
–-
go
into
detail
what
pillorying
means.
but
if
it
was
just
that,
i
reserve
it.
i
think
it's
a
different
question
if
there's
a
substantial
length
of
time
between
the
two
so
the
committee
could
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
witness
would
testify
at
another
hearing.
but
if
it's
perfectly
clear
and
they
call
him
once
he
refuses
to
answer,
i
don't
think
that
he
can
have
a
legislative
purpose
to
as
you
say,
just
drag
him
across
the
country
and
ask
him
precisely
the
same
questions
again
and
again
over
a
short
period
of
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
if
--
if
there
was
--
if
the
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
additional
information
or
he
might
change
his
mind,
yes,
i
think
yes.
there
might
be
a
very
--
very
significant
difference.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
privilege
your
honor
is
the
fifth
amendment,
none
of
these
cases
are
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
diverse.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
it's
the
first.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
suppose
if
he
invoked
the
fifth
amendment,
there
have
been
no
prosecutions
for
a
number
of
years
on
any
witnesses
who've
invoked
the
fifth
amendment,
now,
what
--
so
that
i
assume
that
he
wouldn't
be
prosecuted.
now,
it
would
be
a
very
improper
thing
i
would
think
for
the
committee
to
take
a
witness
across
the
country
and
do
this
although
i
know
of
no
such
cases
on
unwilling
witnesses.
but
if
they
did
it,
i
don't
know
what
the
judicial
remedy
would
be.
i
think
it
would
be
improper
in
my
file
--
his
first
amendment
rights
but
i
can
see
no
way
that
he
would
be
prosecuted.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
as
i
say,
he
--
if
he
can
show
that
they
just
picked
him
up
off
the
street
or
they
pilloried
him
or
that
the
questions
were
not
--
were
not
relevant
then,
yes,
he
can
introduce
such
argument
or
evidence.
much
of
that
evidence
would
come
from
the
transcript
of
the
hearings
itself,
maybe
all
of
them
would.
but
these
it
seems
to
me
are
the
basic
considerations
and
petitioners
nor
as
far
as
i
know
anyone
else
has
ever
suggested
what
additional
considerations
should
be
weighed.
and
this
court
held
that,
given
all
this
set
of
factors
--
set
of
factors
in
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
which
are
almost
the
same
factors
here
except
as
i've
indicated.
i
think
the
government
own
interest
here
is
even
stronger
that
given
the
set
of
factors
that
the
first
amendment
isn't
violated.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that's
essentially
right
your
honor
because
i
think
all
of
it
that
--
that
is
to
say
is
that
when
the
facts
are
essentially
the
same,
the
balance
always
comes
out
the
same
way.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
don't
think
that
what
i've
suggested
is
that
--
that
there
isn't
a
genuine
balancing
in
each
case.
all
that
that
i
suggest
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
governmental
interest
versus
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
to
repeat,
what
they
are
balancing
is
the
governmental
interest
versus
the
individual.
now,
the
governmental
interest
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
it
is
settled
when
the
facts
are
substantially
the
same
but
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
because
i
don't
know
of
any
other
considerations
which
are
proper
in
this
court
is
held.
they
are
no
additional
considerations.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
without
getting
into
what
the
meaning
of
absolute
is
this
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
balancing
process
which
takes
place
under
barenblatt
seems
to
me
to
be
an
actual
--
and
real
balance.
it
is
not
es
--
it
does
not
establish
a
rule
for
all
cases
regardless.
what
it
does
do
is
say
that
when
the
balance
is
essentially
the
same,
when
the
factors
are
the
same
as
in
barenblatt,
then
the
result
will
be
the
same.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
is
there
anything
left
to
balance,
that
is
what
you
balance.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
you'll
balance
the
--
you
balance
the
individual's
interest
in
silence
which
includes
whether
he
was
pillorying,
whether
the
questions
were
relevant
and
whether
he
was
brought
before
the
committee
as
the
result
of
a
dragnet
procedure.
you
balanced
that
against
the
governmental
interest
and
protecting
against
subversion.
now,
the
result
all
--
and
the
same
facts
is
always
the
same.
i
agree
it
should
be
the
same.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
--
well,
your
honor
i'm
--
i'm
assuming
here
that
the
committee
head
of
the
--
head
of
the
legislative
purpose
which
it
stated,
finding
out
about
communist
activities
in
some
particular
area.
now,
this
court
is
held
that
you
don't
look
into
the
--
to
the
motives,
the
--
the
beliefs
of
the
committee.
i'd
--
i
assume
therefore
under
watkins,
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson,
all
four
of
the
cases
that
--
that
the
fact
they
might
have
had
an
improper
motive
would
not
make
it
--
the
inquiry
invalid
under
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
first
amendment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
i
--
i
think
that
that
would
not
make
a
difference
that
he
was
under
indictment.
however,
that
was
not
a
question
which
is
before
the
court
in
any
of
the
cases
perhaps
that
would
be
an
additional
factor
that
would
have
to
be
balanced.
it's
certainly
not
before
the
court
in
any
of
the
cases,
which
are
now
pending
in
this
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
they
involved
however
to
the
first
amendment.
turning
now
to
petitioner
yellin's
contentions
under
rule
iv
of
the
committee's
own
rules
that
the
committee
violated
this
rule
and
therefore,
he
could
not
properly
be
convicted
for
refusing
the
answer
of
the
questions.
he
claims
that
he
had
the
right
to
appear
in
executive
session
rather
than
in
a
public
hearing
under
rule
iv
(a).
now,
rule
iv
(a)
of
the
committee's
rules
which
is
at
beginning
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
is
also
quoted
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
37,
states
that
if
the
committee
and,
“believes
that
the
interrogation
of
a
witness
in
a
public
hearing
might
endanger
national
security
or
unjustly
injure
his
reputation
or
the
reputation
of
other
individuals.
the
committee
show
interrogates
such
witness
in
an
executive
session.
we
submit
that
it
is
clear
that
rule
iv
does
not
convey
any
rights
or
at
least
no
legal
rights
which
are
rever
--
reviewable
in
a
court
on
a
witness
for
the
rule
makes
the
determination
whether
a
witness
shall
appear
in
an
executive
session,
depend
on
the
belief
of
the
committee,
not
on
any
objective
facts.
in
addition,
rule
iv
(a)
does
not
convey
out
of
witness
the
right
and
again
--
or
certainly
not
any
legal
right
reviewable
on
the
courts
that
have
the
committee
make
a
determination
whether
he
should
appear
at
an
executive
session
or
at
public
hearing.
house
rule
11
(g)
makes
committee
hearings
normally
public,
rule
iv
of
the
committee's
rules
merely
provides
for
an
exception
when
the
committee
has
a
certain
belief,
but
even
if
the
committee's
rule,
rule
iv
(a)
did
give
witnesses
a
legal
right
which
was
reviewable
on
the
courts
clearly
a
congressional
committee
has
broad
discretion
to
determine
whether
a
witness
should
be
heard
in
executive
session
or
the
public
hearing.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
one
of
the
--
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
what
the
major
difficulty
with
that
your
honor,
even
assuming
that
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
he
has
that
right.
the
telegram
was
not
sent
until
over
into
approximate
two
weeks
after
the
--
after
the
witness
was
subpoenaed.
it
arrived
and
i
think
also
was
sent
the
same
day
on
february
6th.
the
hearing
was
to
take
place
on
february
10th.
the
chairman
and
the
--
and
the
entire
subcommittee
had
left
washington
for
gary.
they
did
not
see
the
telegram.
now,
mistake
was
made
at
that
point.
the
staff
director
of
the
committee
answered
the
telegram,
he
had
no
authority
to
do
so,
but
he
answered
it
saying
that
the
request
was
denied.
now,
in
this
situation,
we
don't
think
the
committee
was
anymore
chargeable
with
fault
than
the
witness
was.
in
addition
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
no
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
believe
that
so
i
think
that
those
subpoenas
had
to
be
signed
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
case
was
before
the
court
--
i
think
the
fact
is
that
the
chairman
had
--
no
i
think
the
chairman
--
or
at
least
he
had
to
authorize
them
and
it
was
perfectly
clear
in
that
case
the
--
the
shelton
case
is
the
case
you're
thinking
of
your
honor
and
--
and
the
chairman
did
authorize
the
subpoena
in
that
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
here,
the
chairman
did
not
authorize
rejecting
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
want
to
reargue
--
reargue
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
yes.
he
didn't
just
change
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
he
called
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
the
committee.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
there
were
few
steps
left
out
in
between
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
found
out
that
there
wasn't
any
shelton
there
but
then
he
called
the
committee,
that
matter
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
chairman.
the
chairman
said
go
ahead
and
--
and
served
that
--
the
only
shelton
who
was
on
the
new
side
of
the
times
and
that
then
the
subpoena
was
--
was
changed.
so
returning
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
we
think
that
committee
was
no
more
chargeable
for
fault
than
the
witness
himself.
in
addition
uphe
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
as
your
honor
is
suggesting,
they
did
exercise
their
discretion
and
at
least
in
an
uninformed
way
by
--
because
the
chairman
testified
that
they
had
determined
not
to
hear
the
witness
in
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
i
--
but
i
say
uninformed
that
they
were
uninformed
as
to
the
request.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
on
the
request,
they
did
not.
they
exercised
their
discretion
not
to
hear
the
witness
in
executive
session.
now,
let
me
point
out
when
i
say
was
un
--
they
were
uninformed
of
the
telegram.
the
telegram
contains
no
information
which
would
justify
holding
the
--
hearing
the
witness
in
executive
sessions.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
just
a
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
request
and
it
does
not
indicate
anything
which
would
come
under
rule
iv.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
there's
nothing
to
indicate
the
rule
iv
applies
because
the
telegram
merely
says
that
he'd
like
not
to
appear
at
a
public
hearing
because
--
because
of
the
publicity
which
of
course
--
which
the
course
is
obvious.
now,
rule
iv
requires
in
order
to
have
a
witness
appear
in
an
executive
session
either
that
his
testimony
will
endanger
national
security
or
that
it
will
unjustly
injure
his
reputation.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that
might
be
involved
but
all
--
what
i
was
addressing
my
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
interpretation
of
the
telegram?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
just
publicity
--
publi
--
the
thing
is
rule
iv
doesn't
say
that
mere
publicity
isn't
up.
it
has
to
be
unjust
injury
to
his
reputation.
and
in
fact,
the
committee
soon,
it
could
reasonably
believe
that
there
would
be
no
unjust
injury
to
his
reputation.
they
already
had
heard
sworn
testimony
in
public
session
that
--
that
petitioner
yellin
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
it
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
the
committee
does
not
consider
it
unjust
injury
to
a
witness'
reputation,
to
have
him
identified
as
a
communist.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
committee
denied
its
appearance
in
an
executive
session.
now,
it's
hard
to
believe
that
it
didn't
know
that
he
would
be
identified,
that
there
would
be
a
suggestion
after
session
that
he
was
--
that
he
was
a
communist.
now,
that
is
certainly
not
a
very
--
a
very
subtle
thing
for
the
committee
to
have
--
to
have
thought
about.
and
apparently,
they
decided
and
exercise
their
discretion.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
this
decision
was
prior
to
the
hearing.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
by
the
committee.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i've
--
i
had
not
mean
to
suggest
that
when
the
committee
denied
the
appearance
of
petitioner
in
executive
session
that
they
had
its
request
in
front
of
them
--
his
request
in
front
of
them.
they
did
not
--
the
committee
did
not
have
this
request
in
front
of
them.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
they
denied
--
when
they'd
decided
to
have
him
appear
in
public
session,
which
is
the
normal
practice
under
the
--
the
rules
of
the
house
of
representatives.
that
when
they
decided
that,
they
could
hardly
have
failed
to
know
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
possibility
that
there
would
be
--
at
the
hearing
that
he
would
--
there'll
be
suggestion
he
was
a
communist.
after
all,
that
was
the
basis
for
calling
him.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
apparently,
it
does
come
up
because
in
this
very
case
without
knowing
of
the
request,
the
committee
decided
not
to
have
him
appear
in
an
executive
session.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
is
affirmative
evidence
in
the
record
from
the
chairman
of
the
committee
that
they
decided
not
to
hear
the
witness
at
an
executive
session.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
it's
--
in
page
up
here.
it's
at
the
top
of
the
page,
three
--
page
70
of
the
record,
it's
the
third
line.
well,
the
committee
already
passed
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
would
hear
mr.
yellin
at
a
session
and
--
and
that
would
--
and
that
was
discussing
at
an
executive
session
if
you'll
notice
the
question
of
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
might
have
been
different,
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
he
did
say.
that's
on
the
same
page
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
situ
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but,
let
--
let
me
say,
however,
that
the
petitioner's
contention
is
a
--
certainly
suggest
an
incredibly
technical
reading
of
the
--
of
the
committee's
rules,
all
the
committee's
rules
--
first
of
all,
the
committees,
well,
don't
say
that
you
have
a
right
to
have
this
issue
determined
by
the
committee.
second
of
all,
they
don't
say
that
particular
facts
exist
that
the
witness
is
entitled
to
have
--
to
be
testified
in
executive
session.
it
merely
says
that
if
they
have
--
if
the
committee
has
a
belief
which
i
assume
is
the
most
subjective
kind
of
word
one
could
possibly
use
that
then
--
then
the
witness
will
be
given
the
opportunity
to
appear
in
an
executive
session.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
i
agree
your
honor.
the
reason
for
the
rules
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
part
of
my
answer
is
--
what
i
said
to
mr.
justice
stewart
that
he
had
the
opportunity
and
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
partly
through
his
form,
partly
through
the
committee's
fault
that
--
that
the
two
of
them
didn't
get
together
very
well.
now,
aside
from
that,
the
fact
that
he
didn't
have
this
opportunity
in
this
very
no
--
non-mandatory
permissive
rule
to
reverse
petitioner's
conviction
on
this
basis,
seems
to
me
a
very
technical
reading
of
the
committee's
rules.
i'd
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
a
proceeding
in
the
--
in
the
district
courts.
these
things
aren't
done
on
a
very
legal
basis.
the
things
tend
to
be
done
on
a
basis
of
negotiation
and
--
and
discussion.
to
apply
the
kind
of
rules
that
one
might
apply
and
they
did
in
the
district
court,
seems
to
--
seem
to
me
to
--
to
be
a
very
serious
mistake
with
the
coordinate
branch
of
--
of
the
government.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
you
mean
legal
rights
protected
in
the
court?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh
i
think
it
has
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
no,
i
think
it
has
--
it
has
considerable
protection
to
tell
them
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
tells
the
witness
that
if
he
presents
evidence
to
a
committee
which
fall
into
any
of
the
three
categories
and
the
committee
believes
that
they
will
hear
him
in
executive
session.
in
fact,
they
did
hear
--
they
do
hear
people
in
executive
session.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
there's
no
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there's
no
indication
that
he
offered
to
do
it.
his
telegram
merely
says
that
he'd
be
exposed
to
publicity.
now,
i
suggest
that
the
committee
understood
that.
there
was
no
possible
way
you
will
hear
in
public
session
in
which
are
not
exposed
to
publicity.
so
he
did
not
offer
to
pres
--
to
present
evidence
under
any
of
these
three
considerations.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
one
of
the
--
the
reasons
that
he
has
to
give
is
that
it
was
unjust
injury
to
his
reputation
or
the
injury
of
others,
unjust,
not
injury
to
his
reputation.
it
is
not
enough
that
he
would
be
identified
as
a
communist.
if
he
is
a
communist
or
the
committee
reasonably
believes
he's
a
communist,
the
committee
believes
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
fair
interpretation
of
its
--
of
its
rules
and
this
in
the
record
that
is
not
unjust
injury
to
his
reputation.
it's
injury
but
--
but
the
committee
believes
that
--
that
this
is
just.
and
in
fact,
he'd
already
been
identified,
as
i
have
said
in
public
session,
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
the
very
same
public
session
to
which
mr.
barenblatt
was
identified.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
because
the
committee
hopes
that
he
will
testify
and
i
assume
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
hopes
to
testify
is
that
there
is
some
additional
pressure
to
testify
from
appearing
at
a
public
session.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
matter
of
psychology,
this
--
this
is
true
but
apparently,
that
is
one
--
one
of
the
beliefs
for
the
committee.
they
don't
want
to
put
a
premium,
in
other
words,
for
witnesses
not
to
talk
and
that
would
be
the
premium.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
think
it
does
indicate
that
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
they
could
--
you
mean
they
could
fail
to
get
the
information.
he
would
say
--
he
would
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
they
think
that
the
additional
pressure
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
think
--
i
don't
know
whether
it's
true
or
not.
but
then
he
gets
a
reason
of
--
reasonable
assumption
that
the
theory
is,
i
suppose
that
there
is
some
pressure
not
to
invoke
constitutional
privileges
when
asked
questions
about
communism,
maybe
the
very
same
pressure
that
--
that
is
invoked
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
yes,
of
course
they
were.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
want
to
get
--
getting
him
to
--
to
testify
to
--
you
don't
have
--
after
all
the
first
person
doesn't
--
isn't
required
to
raise
his
first
amendment
rights,
of
course
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
what
do
you
mean
by
pressure,
i
think
to
--
that
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right,
which
is
the
normal
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
which
is
the
normal
duty
that
a
person
has
in
his
country
just
to
give
testimony
when
he's
asked
for
a
properly
constituted
authority.
now
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
aren't
at
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
would
agree
but
it
seems
to
me
the
--
the
minimal
pressure
of
saying,
"you're
going
to
have
to
exercise
your
privilege
in
public."
let
me
take
the
example
of
a
court.
would
it
be
wrong
for
a
court
to
make
a
witness
that
they
were
--
that
they
wanted
to
testify,
appear
before
the
court
and
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
right
without
--
when
he
told
them
in
private,
"i'm
going
to
invoke
my
fifth
amendment
right,"
would
the
have
to
say,
"whether
we
won't
call
you."
well
this
would
put
an
actual
bonus
on
--
on
people
to
not
--
to
just
tell
people,
"i'm
going
to
invoke
my
first
or
my
fifth
amendment
right
or
some
other
right."
the
committee
doesn't
want
to
--
to
give
people
this
encouragement.
he
wants
to
say,
"well,
you
can
invoke
it
but
you're
going
to
have
to
invoke
it
in
public.”
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that
--
that's
first
of
all,
unconstitutional,
or
second
of
all,
even
unfair.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
think
so
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
is
--
this
has
been
a
--
this
is
traditional
in
this
country,
the
witness
is
called.
he
invokes
his
rights
and
if
he's
right
is
--
and
if
it's
properly
invoked,
that's
the
end
of
it.
but
i
don't
think
it's
enough
where
witness
to
say,
"well,
i'm
going
to
invoke
my
--
my
constitutional
right
so
just
don't
bother
me
anymore."
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
doesn't
end
it.
that's
never
has
and
i
don't
think
it
should.
well,
i
forgot
in
which
of
the
witnesses.
i
think
it's
--
which
of
the
petitioners,
i
think
it's
mr.
silver.
yes,
it
was
mr.
silver.
he
told
one
of
the
investigators
when
he
--
when
he
was
interviewed
by
the
investigator
that
he
was
going
to
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
right.
the
committee
called
him
anyway.
he
didn't
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
right.
now,
he
did
invoke
the
first
amendment
but
he
testified
to
a
considerable
extent
about
his
own
activities.
he
didn't
go
into
detail
but
he
said
he
was
a
communist.
now,
this
is
the
kind
of
example.
it
doesn't
to
me
this
is
wrong,
assuming
not
unconstitutionally
wrong
and
it
is
not
--
and
i
don't
think
unfair.
now
in
conclu
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh
yes.
all
three
of
the
petitioners
had
counsel
and
they
actively
participated
in
the
hearings
although
at
times,
they
were
cut
short
by
their
ordinary
rule
of
the
committee
that
they
aren't
supposed
to
conduct
the
debate
directly
with
the
committee,
although
such
debates
did
frequently
take
place
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
in
conclusion
on
this
point,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
contrary
to
what
mr.
rabinowitz
said.
petitioner
was
not
convicted
because
of
the
confusion
over
the
executive
session.
rule
iv
(a)
does
not
require
that
the
committee
allow
a
witness
to
appear
in
executive
session
and
certainly
not
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
even
if
the
committee
had
allowed
petitioner
to
appear
in
executive
session,
there's
absolutely
no
indication
that
he
would
have
had
answered
the
questions
which
the
committee
asked
him.
and
of
course
if
he
refused
on
the
same
grounds
which
be
here
in
the
same
posture
except
for
the
fact
that
this
one
argument
under
rule
iv
would
--
would
not
be
in
the
case,
so
that
there
is
nothing
to
the
argument
that
the
only
reason
we're
here
is
because
of
--
of
this
confusion
over
the
sending
of
the
telegram,
they're
sending
of
it
to
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
or
the
committee
should
have
listened
more
carefully
at
the
hearing
or
any
of
the
--
any
of
the
confusions
which
admittedly
did
take
place.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
think
maybe
the
reason
i
don't
know
is
that
those
witnesses
probably
don't
testify
him.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
maybe
those
witnesses
don't
testify
publicly,
maybe
they
tell
everything
they
have
and
the
committee
is
satisfied.
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
and
they
interviewed
for
example
mr.
silver
and
i
--
and
i
gather
--
i
think
this
is
only
an
inference
from
the
record
that
he
didn't
--
they
didn't
talk
to
him.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
so
they
--
they
often
to
do
but
they
didn't
do
in
this
case.
they
didn't
interview
petitioner
yellin
in
this
case
and
to
be
frank
with
your
honor
and
--
and
then
the
first
reason
they
didn't
was
that
he
was
in
denver
and
then
the
interviews
were
being
conducted
in
gary.
now,
there's
also
some
confusion
on
the
record
about
whether
they
would
have
interviewed
him
if
he
had
been
in
gary.
there's
some
talk
that
they
wouldn't
have
anyway
because
they
didn't
think
he
would
talk.
but
in
any
event
the
actual
reason
they
didn't
was
because
he
was
in
a
different
city.
petitioner's
last
document
goes
only
to
--
to
the
questions
involved
in
counts
2
and
4.
he
claims
that
they
were
too
vague
to
support
his
indictment
and
therefore
too
vague
to
support
his
conviction.
now,
of
course
the
first
and
conclusive
answer
is
this
goes
only
two
counts
even
if
he's
right
on
it,
the
other
two
counts
are
valid
and
that
--
since
there
was
an
concurrent
sentence,
the
conviction
would
have
to
be
sustained.
the
second
answer
is
that
he
did
not
raise
this
issue
in
his
petition
for
certiorari
and
therefore,
this
would
be
for
the
court.
and
the
third
answer
is
that
his
contention
on
his
merits
without
substance,
as
far
as
i
know
no
--
no
indictment
under
the
contempt
of
congress
statute
has
ever
explained
the
meaning
if
the
questions.
the
only
two
questions
which
are
--
there
is
any
doubt
--
the
only
two
words
that
there's
any
doubt
about
it,
the
words
colonization
and
colonizer
and
it's
very
difficult
to
understand
how
petitioner
could
have
been
confused
about
them.
admittedly,
they've
--
they
are
some
--
there
are
words
of
art
that
petitioner
admits
that
he
was
present
during
the
lengthy
testimony
of
the
previous
witness
in
which
he
went
into
detail
what
these
questions
and
what
these
words
meant.
and
in
fact,
the
previous
witness
specifically
defined
the
word
colonize
and
the
petitioner
was
in
any
doubt
at
his
trial
and/or
petitioner's
counsel,
all
he
would
have
had
to
do
is
read
the
transcript
of
the
hearings
and
he
would
--
have
certain
be
fully
satisfied.
however,
petitioner
argues
that
this
isn't
enough
that
has
to
be
in
the
indictment.
it
isn't
enough
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that's
the
start
but
apparently
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
infiltration
is
the
start
of
the
definition
apparently,
the
more
--
the
more
full
definition
by
those
in
the
communist
part
and
in
the
committee
who
seemed
to
understand
each
other
is
that
--
that
the
party
had
a
program
which
began
in
1948
of
what
it
called
colonization.
what
they
did
is
they
sent
college
graduates
or
at
least
people
in
college
who
had
a
considerable
amount
of
training
in
the
basic
industries,
steel,
transportation
and
textile
mills,
automobiles
and
the
like.
these
people
concealed
the
fact
that
they
had
excellent
educations
from
the
workers
in
order
so
that
they
would
attain
a
position
of
importance
in
the
labor
movement
and
would
be
able
to
influence
them
which
of
course,
they
would
have
trouble
doing
if
they've
told
that
they
were
members
--
they
had
good
educations.
in
fact,
they
might
not
even
get
a
job
because
companies
of
course
would
be
suspicious
that
people
who
want
to
become
permanently
not
just
for
summer
job,
steel
workers
on
--
on
the
regular
line
right
at
the
--
right
at
the
furnace.
so
they
can
--
now,
this
is
exactly
what
happened
to
petitioner
yellin
and
that's
what
the
committee
had
evidence
of
this.
his
application
for
employment
in
1949
in
the
carnegie
illinois
steel
company
in
gary,
did
not
disclose
that
he
had
been
to
new
york
--
city
college
of
new
york
and
the
university
of
michigan
and
had
--
and
had
virtually
an
aa
average
and
so
that
--
that's
precisely
the
subject
that
the
committee
was
interested
in.
thank
you
your
honor.
