was

justice
william

since
i've
been
on
the
court
through
that,
this
happened
and
then
a
membership
of
the
court
changed
and
the
no
case
was
rather
immediately
overruled
as
i
remember
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
you
are
engaged
in
the
balancing
processes,
i
gather
you
are,
then
you
would
have
consider
i
would
think
in
this
case,
the
yellin
case
the
extent
of
which
yellin's
testimony,
it
was
necessary
for
the
(inaudible)
by
congress
that
it
is
--
justice

douglas
--
provided
by
the
(voice

justice
william
o.
douglas
i
misunderstood
the
record.
i
understood
that
the
committee
already
had
this
information.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
suppose
(voice

--
justice
william

--
certainly.
and
anyway,
like
it
goes
to
my
earlier
question
as
to
whether
or
not
--
whether
you're
weighing
or
balancing,
whatever
the
phrase
is,
whether
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
the
importance
of
this
particular
witness'
testimony
to
the
performance
of
the
legislative
function
must
not
be
considered.
i
don't
know
if
this
--
did
--
they
seemed
to
have
had
all
the
information
that
they
could
possibly
got
from
this
man.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
certainly
sending
him
to
prison
doesn't
get
him
more
information.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
that
would
be
true
if
you
were
investigating
the
church
or
the
--
what
(inaudible)
confession
on
it.
that
would
be
very
interesting
information
that
some
congressmen
that
i
think
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
relevancy
of
my
question
obviously
was
whether
or
not
barenblatt
is
--
should
be
overruled.
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
about
the
naacp
versus
alabama?
i
suppose
many
would
think
precisely
as
you
do
in
this
case,
in
that
field,
they're
very
critical.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
