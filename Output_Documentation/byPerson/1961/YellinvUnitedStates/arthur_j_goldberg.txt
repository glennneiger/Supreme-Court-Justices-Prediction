he
will
--
did
the
witness
himself
asked
the
committee
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
rabinowitz,
before
you
leave
the
rule
question,
would
it
be
in
your
argument
that
the
witness
himself
has
a
right
to
have
his
application
for
an
executive
session
passed
upon?
or
would
it
be
sufficient
that
the
committee
in
substance
consider
it
on
its
own
motion?
or
on
application
whether
it
wouldn't
go
into
executive
session
with
a
particular
situation?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
then
i
take
it
from
that,
that
you're
argument
then
would
be
to
--
and
i'm
not
saying
it
took
place
in
this
case,
but
rather
to
be
a
reference
to
the
record
if
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
you
have
to
interpret
what
was
said.
but
i
take
it
from
that
that
the
committee,
on
its
own
motion,
majority
being
present,
said,
â€œwe
have
to
consider
whether
we
apply
our
rule
or
we're
not
going
to
apply
it.
you
would
say
that
would
not
be
sufficient
because
an
element
in
that
decision
would
be
the
application?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
sole
evidence
we
have
on
that
is
the
record
reference
from
which
you
