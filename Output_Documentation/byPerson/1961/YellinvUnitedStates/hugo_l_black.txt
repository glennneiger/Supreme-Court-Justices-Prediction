justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question
in
connection
with
expert
testimony?
should
i
recall
that
the
government
of
short
time
ago
argued
that
expert
testimony
should
be
admitted
from
time-to-time
to
approve
or
disapprove
obscenity,
do
you
think
that
had
any
relation
to
this
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
--
i
may
be
wrong
and
i
recall
it
was
an
order
to
determine
whether
it
was
offensive
to
the
more
reason
of
the
community.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
question
(inaudible)?
as
i
understand
it,
you're
saying
that
if
there
the
committee
has
some
information
that
a
man
is
a
communist
(inaudible)
and
they
do
not,
whatever
you
mean
by
pillorying
than
then
the
fact
that
it's
in
the
field
of
communism,
leave
nothing
to
be
balanced
so
far
their
rights
to
interrogated
their
concern
and
they
can
continue
to
interrogate
them
in
connection
with
communism
as
distinct
from
something
like
n.a.a.c.p
or
somewhat
organization.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now,
may
i
ask
you
this
and
i
--
i
maybe
wrong
but
as
i
understand
the
rumor
about
that
thing,
it
exists
in
order
to
escape
what
is
said
to
be
a
much
(inaudible)
that
is
the
doctrine
of
absolutism.
why
is
that
matter
an
absolutely
as
proved
under
your
definition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
balancing
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he's
a
communist
--
if
he's
a
communist
or
they
think
he's
a
communist
they
want
to
ask
him
question,
what
is
that
left
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
isn't
all
settled
finally,
completely
once
and
for
all,
what
if
he
is
a
communist
so
they
have
reason
to
believe
you.
you
summon
a
man
without
bringing
a
man
under
dragnet
and
they
do
not
pillory
him
or
whatever
that
means?
isn't
it
all
settled?
haven't
they
got
a
right
to
ask
him
anything
they
want
to
although
they
might
not
have
a
right
to
ask
the
members
of
some
of
the
organizations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
facts,
just
those
fact,
why
is
that
not,
the
doctrine
there
absolute
his
position
with
reference
to
that
question
in
the
first
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
your
view
and
i
think
--
i
think
you're
doing,
if
i
may
say
so
making
a
fair
presentation
view
points.
but
all
i'm
asking
is,
if
that's
true
why
is
not
that
an
absolute
lists
of
view
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
apply
when
the
balancing
doctrines
seems
to
rest
on
the
idea
that
there
must
be
no
absoluteness
protection
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
know
either.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
why
if
that's
true,
is
all
i'm
asking?
that's
true
if
a
witness
is
called
up
the
reason
to
believe
he's
a
communist,
is
asked
the
question
--
they
asked
where
you
say
in
the
ninth,
13
come
now,
not
repeated
time
after
time,
say
100
times
same
question,
just
two
or
three
times.
and
he
question
is
--
the
question
is
communism
rather
than
whether
he
is
n.a.a.c.p
member,
member
of
some
other
organization.
is
there
anything
left
to
balance
or
is
not
true
at
that
time,
the
committee
is
the
investigating
committee,
that
has
a
right
to
ask
him
whatever
it
would
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
that
subject.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
there's
anything
left
but
what
should
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
be
left?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
for
instance,
he
was
on
the
indictment
and
he
did
not
plead
the
first
amendment,
i
mean
the
fifth
amendment.
he's
more
to
plead
there.
but
you
kept
telling
him
that
he
didn't
want
to
testify
because
there
was
indictment
pending
against
to
somewhere.
and
that
whole
question
resided
around
the
indictment,
would
that
be
admissible
on
the
balancing
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
referring
to
motive.
i'm
referring
whether
there's
anything
else
that
kind
of
bring
up
something
else
that
might
entitle
the
man
to
say,
“when
you
go
to
balance
this,
the
government
just
don't
let
me
alone
on
this
particular
question
because
it
is
an
interest
and
not
--
the
government
sender
is
not
sufficient
to
go
that
far
with
reference
of
this
question
even
in
the
field
of
communist.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
i
recall,
and
my
recollection
may
be
wrong,
one
--
one
statement
was
made
that
the
chairman
of
committee
said
that
if
he
had
known
about
it,
it
might
have
been
different
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
he
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
same
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that's
the
fact
that
they
believe
solely
he's
a
communist,
he
has
no
right
to
be
heard
as
in
executive
session.
why
isn't
that
simply
exposing
him
in
order
to
expose
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly,
it
does
indicate,
it
doesn't
matter.
they
want
something
beside
the
information.
they
could
get
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
information
in
executive
session,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
get
the
information
in
executive
session.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
would
be
for
some
reason
that
he'd
love
to
testify,
avoid
the
public
at
the
executive
session.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
open
to
prove
or
it
does
have
to
assume
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
weren't
trying
to
get
him
not
to
raise
constitutional
privileges
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
sure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know,
but
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
that
the
committee,
congress,
putting
pressure
on
people,
trying
to
keep
them
from
raising
a
constitutional
privilege?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
also
has,
doesn't
he
a
privilege
that
the
constitution
gives
it
to
him
to
exercise
that
privilege
without
any
pressure
by
government
to
get
him
to
break
to
the
--
not
to
exercise
a
privilege?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
had
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
that
--
it
depends
on
the
same
extent
on
what
weight
and
appraisal
you
put
on
the
value
of
a
constitutional
privilege,
doesn't
it?
or
rather
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
court
would
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
rather
the
court
would
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
what
you
say
now
is
that
if
he
appeared
and
wants
to
tell
to
the
committee,
he
is
invoking
it
--
that
intake
and
they're
not
supposed
to
ask
him
a
100
questions
thereafter
on
the
same
line.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
you
later
discuss
it
within
on
cross-examination
of
it,
i
mean
at
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
tell
you
what's
they
were,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where's
this
telegram
hide
it
and
tight
and
put
in
the
record
or
put
into
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
in
the
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
whom
were
they
turned
over?
to
whom
were
they
turned
over?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
when
you
--
when
this
colloquy
came
up,
did
you
hand
them
to
anybody
or
did
they
refuse
to
take
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
rule
to
which
mr.
walter
called
your
attention
when
he
said,
“you
know
the
rules
of
the
committee?”
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
they
have
appropriation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
you
have
them
link?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
tried
link
this,
the
telegram?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
know
what
the
telegram
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
tell
him
of
the
executive
session
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
statute
quoted
in
your
brief,
to
which
you
referred
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
do
you
mean
by
that,
that
that's
the
only
conditions,
those
are
to
be
set
up
and
barred
beyond
which
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
that
rule
apply
at
any
time
to
overruling
the
case?
now,
that's
a
general
statement.
i
don't
see
why
it
could
be
limited
to
those
few
grounds.of
course,
it
should
--
what
i
mean
is,
do
you
say
that
it
should
be
limited
to
the
cases
where
there's
clearest
error,
but
if
the
court
thinks
that
the
clearest
error,
then
your
standard
is
met,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
would
ask
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
like
to
ask
you
another
question
with
this.
that
implies
that
the
court
sometimes
does
it.
the
basis
of
what
he
speaks
the
law
ought
to
be
rather
on
the
basis
of
what
he
thinks
it
is.
and
the
mere
fact
that
one
vote
to
overrule
a
past
decision
of
the
court
certainly
cannot
give
rise
to
attributing
to
that
person,
the
desire
simply
to
get
his
own
notion
to
the
--
of
the
law
even
though
they're
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
final
analysis,
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
a
judge
who
was
here
under
oath
to
support
the
constitution
should
construe
it
after
considering
all
of
these
things
that
you
say
according
to
his
best
judgment
of
what
it
--
what
it
means?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
one
of
the
counts
under
which
he
was
convicted
was
the
one
that
said
he
declined
to
tell
where
he
lived?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
suppose
he
should
be
doubted
on
whether
they
knew
where
he
lived,
isn't
it?
again,
he's
been
convicted
for
failure
to
tell
them
where
he
lives
as
though
that
makes
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
part
of
the
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
can
you
(voice
overlap)
to
support
that
count
under
the
balancing
doctrines?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
didn't
already
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
there's
any
possibility
that
first,
we
should
read
this
record
and
not
know
that
they
knew
where
he
lived
in
gary,
indiana?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
your
argument
imply
--
i'm
not
saying
it
should
be,
expressing
views
about
getting
evidence
on
the
constitutional
questions
overtime.
but
wouldn't
your
argument
imply
equally
to
the
position
that's
been
taken
recently
in
a
number
of
courts.like
you
said,
it's
not
been
found
on
by
this
court
that
you
can
introduce
witnesses
to
find
out
whether
in
a
particular
community,
a
matter
is
obscene
in
order
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
the
law?
what
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice

black
i
didn't
know
that
was
involved
in
a
case
here
at
the
moment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
about
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
about
it
in
connection
with
this
argument.
i
remember
--
i
recall
arguing
very
vigorously
against
hearing
evidence
to
determine
whether
the
legislature
had
a
right
to
decide
a
certain
train
practices
per
se.
it
took
several
weeks
to
get
evidence
and
determine
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
on
that
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
that
that
would
--
that
would
control
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
reason
i
asked
for
your
general
argument
was
--
and
i
may
say
that
it's
--
i'm
not
going
to
--
indicated
you
to
disagree
with
that
general
argument
was
that
you
should
decide
the
constitutional
questions
on
the
basis
of
the
constitution
rather
than
people's
evidence
about
whether
the
thing
was
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.

was
there
any
indication
that
the
government
wanted
to
pass
a
local
bill
reg
--
regulating
conditions
that
gave

it's
supposed
to
be
a
general

covering
this
subject
all
over
the
country?
justice

did
you
argue
that
point?
justice

have
you

was
