mr.
rabinowitz,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice

we'll
recess
now,
mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
number
477,
edward
yellin,
petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
rabinowitz,
you
may
continue
your
arguments.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
terris,
assuming
that
they're
accepted
rather
the
--
the
barenblatt
doctrine
that
there
is
balancing
processes
between
the
rights
of
individual
and
the
rights
of
the
--
of
the
government.
is
it
your
position
now
that
that
all
that
balancing
has
been
done
and
that
there
is
nothing
open
to
the
--
to
the
defendant
in
the
case
of
this
kind
to
balance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we'll
just
say
for
all
cases
at
this
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
telling
me
--
would
you
mind
telling
me
please,
what
kind
of
testimony
would
be
available
to
a
defendant
in
the
case
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
either
there
is
--
there
is
something
available
to
him
where
there
isn't
now.
now,
if
there
is,
i
just
like
to
know
what
it
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris,
may
i
put
it
this
way
through
you
then?
do
--
under
the
barenblatt
case
and
the
wilkinson
case,
is
it
your
position
that
every
witness
regardless
of
the
circumstances
of
his
case
stands
in
exactly
the
same
position
before
the
committee
so
far
as
the
balancing
process
is
concerned,
namely
that
there
is
--
there
is
nothing
--
there
can
be
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
circumstances
of
any
particular
case
that
would
change
it
and
that
is
a
matter
of
rope.
we
must
now
say,
in
every
case
where
a
--
where
a
pertinent
question
is
asked
that
there
is
no
countervailing
interest
that
--
that
can
prevail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
get
a
definition
like
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
regardless
of
any
other
equities
of
any
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
–-
let's
take
a
question
of
this
kind.
in
--
i
forgot
in
whether
it
was
wilkinson
or
braden
and
we
found
that
a
committee
had
taken
one
witness.
i
think
he
was
an
employee
of
the
customs
department,
all
around
the
country
to
about
entertain
different
places
and
they
had
him
testify
to
the
very
same
thing
concerning
the
same
bags
of
male
and
what
was
in
--
what
was
in
those
bags,
particular
bags
of
a
male.
now,
suppose
we
had
a
situation
with
that
kind
with
–
with
this
defendant
mr.
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
yellin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
a
long
period
of
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
if
he
claimed
the
privilege
once
and
they
gave
him
a
little
time
that
they
could
call
him
again
on
the
theory
that
he
might
have
changed
his
mind
and
then
that
--
on
that
basis
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
could
take
him
all
over
the
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
that
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
isn't
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
certainly
is
pertinent
to
the
discussion
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
assume
that
the
--
that
the
government
did
have
to
show
the
importance
of
the
investigation
it
was
conducting.
and
all
i'm
asking
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
--
is
there
any
way
that
--
that
a
witness
can
offer
any
testimony
in
order
to
counter
balance
that
kind
of
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
argue
another
case
mr.
terris
at
where
the
--
where
the
rules
the
committee
say
that
the
--
that
the
committee
itself
may
issue
subpoenas
that
these
very
people
such
as
one
he
sent
the
telegrams
to
have
the
power
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
issue
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
--
didn't
we
have
a
case
recently
there
were
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
shelton,
was
that
the
new
york
times
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
he
--
he
has
changed
it
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
stated
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
when
he
got
there.
i
thought
he
got
to
the
new
york
--
new
york
times
and
asked
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no.
no,
no,
but
i
mean
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
other
one
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
got
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
and
found
out
that
there
was
no
shelton
by
that
name
so
he
just
--
he
just
gave
it
to
another
shelton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
left
out,
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
this
reasonable
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
suppose
that
they
didn't
--
isn't
reasonable
to
suppose
they
didn't
consider
that
at
all
because
i
understood
mr.
rabinowitz,
congressman
walter,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
who
--
who
testified
at
the
trial
said
he
had
never
seen
the
telegrams,
never
heard
of
them
until
that
day
in
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
mr.
terris
under
those
circumstances,
the
question
of
a
--
of
an
executive
session
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
a
witness
would
never
come.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
never
come
up
unless
--
unless
there's
some
--
was
some
request
such
as
was
made
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
their
affirmative
evidence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
effect
they
decided
not
to
have
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
if
they
just
subpoenaed
him
to
testify
in
a
public
session?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
the
rule
iv,
isn't
a
rule
to
manifest
fairness
and
to
give
a
--
give
a
witness
an
opportunity
to
--
to
present
his
cause
in
that
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
didn't
have
that
opportunity
here,
did
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
didn't
suggest
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
under
your
--
under
your
interpretation
so
far
as
protection
of
a
--
of
a
witness
is
concerned,
this
rule
means
nothing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
any
protection.
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
means
nothing
because
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
is
--
what
is
that
protection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
he
offer
to
do
that
and
--
and
did
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
summarily
did
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
admirations
would
a
man
have
or
wanted
in
--
wanting
an
executive
hearing
other
than
to
avoid
the
publicity
of
a
--
of
arbitrary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
committee
ever
have
witnesses
who
will
testify
in
private
but
who
won't
testify
publicly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
do
take
the
private
questions
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
what
--
just
what
does
colonization
mean?
i
don't
know
is
infiltration
or
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
does
it
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rabinowitz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
page
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
35,
edward
yellin,
petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
rabinowitz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rabinowitz,
you
may
continue
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
general,
after
that
--
after
that
answer
that
you
just
read
of
senator
mcclelland's,
as
you
then
having
said
that
it
was
in
answer
to
a
general
question,
there
was
another
one.
“are
those
the
only
circumstances
under
which
executive
hearings
are
held?”
the
answer
is,
“i
don't
know
of
any
other
except
that
where
we
are
fearful,
the
testimony
might
be
induced,
it
could
be
harmful
to
the
national
defense.
we
are
not
so
sure
about
the
testimony
of
any
witnesses”.
isn't
that
rather
specific?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
he
tried
to
lay
a
predicate
for
it,
didn't
he,
by
offering
the
telegrams?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
other
reason
than
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
general,
just
how
would
a
defendant
in
a
given
case
raise
this
balancing
issue
where
barenblatt
says
that
the
balancing
had
to
be
related
to
the
particular
circumstance
shown?
now,
i
suppose
that
means
a
particular
case.
now,
how
would
the
defendant
raise
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
wouldn't
do
that
below
--
they
wouldn't
do
that
below
though,
would
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
it
was
--
took
the
position
that
it
was
irrelevant
and
wouldn't
let
them
introduce
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
one
of
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
we're
deciding,
aren't
we
determining
here
whether
a
man
can
be
put
to
jail,
put
in
jail
in
these
circumstances.
and
aren't
we
determining
whether
or
not
he's
entitled
to
make
a
defense
for
himself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rabinowitz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
adjourn.
