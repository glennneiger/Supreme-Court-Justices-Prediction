justice
potter
stewart
this
witness
had
never
appeared
at
an
executive
session,
has
he?
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
you
reading
from
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
testimony
after
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
what,
mr.
arens
or
mr.
tavenner?
justice
potter
stewart
walker.
justice
potter
stewart
chairman
of
the
committee
--
of
the
subcommittee.
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
--
what
if
anything
does
the
transcript
of
the
subcommittee
hearing
show
with
respect
to
the
request
for
an
executive
session?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
he
was
from
the
university
of
colorado.
justice
potter
stewart
before
exercising
the
discretion,
do
you
think
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
have
the
chairman
of
the
committee
at
least
read
his
telegram
and
know
what
was
in
it?
justice
potter
stewart
his
counsel's
telegram.
justice
potter
stewart
but
perhaps
not
--
perhaps
it's
not
so
much
a
matter
of
fault,
it's
just
a
matter
of
a
--
whether
or
not,
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
have
the
many
exercise
--
his
discretion
that
have
been
informed
way
rather
than
uninformed.
justice
potter
stewart
simply
a
request
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
just
that,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no
factual
basis
for
the
re
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
telegram
itself.
justice
potter
stewart
where
does
that
appear
in
the
record
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
distance
has
to
do
with
it
when
you're
talking
about
telegram.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
then
there's
such
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
were
you
--
were
you
--
there
was
no
prospect
that
you
were
going
to
have
a
face-to-face
conversation.
you
didn't
have
one
before
you
sent
the
telegram,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
injured
as
--
there
are
some
questions
about
whether
or
not
you
sent
it
to
the
right
person?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
--
that
was
mr.
tavenner?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
there
was
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
try
to
convicted
of
--
either
sending
a
telegram
too
late
or
sending
it
to
the
wrong
person,
he
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
tried
and
convicted
of
refusing
to
answer
questions
directly
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rabinowitz,
the
--
you
filed
a
new
reply
brief
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
not
a
new
original
brief,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
when
that
rule
was
promulgated?
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
be
interested
in
knowing
when
the
rule
was
promulgated
and
how
many
times,
if
at
all,
that
congress
has
reauthorized
the
committee
since
the
promulgation
of
this
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
can
find
that
out.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
stand
--
standing
committee
of
congress
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
does
it
need
to
be
read
--
constituted
these
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
every
two
years?
justice
potter
stewart
or
every
two
years
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
every
congress
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
called
congressman
walter
as
your
witness
at
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
was
your
witness
as
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
well,
this
has
been
passed
on
in
good
many
other
cases
in
addition
to
those
you
mentioned,
sinclair
and,
i
guess,
a
dozen
of
others
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
at
least,
it
was
implicit,
that
is
--
convictions
were
affirmed.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
you
can
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
(inaudible)
--
if
you
follow
the
literal
language
of
the
constitution,
of
the
first
amendment,
what
kind
of
a
case
would
you
have?
justice
potter
stewart
what
language?
what
literal
language
of
the
first
amendment
are
you
relying
on?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
you
have
to
depart
in
the
literal
language.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
being
absolute
--
being
absolute
is
being
literal
and
you
have
to
depart
from
the
literal
language
of
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
is
the
--
where
does
it
appear
in
the
record
that
the
committee
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
did
apply
the
test
of
the
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
think
that
would
probably
be
enough
in
from
the
absence
of
anything
to
the
contrary
but
i'm
--
notice
that
on
page
82
of
the
record,
there
is
a
suggestion
to
the
contrary
that
they
--
and
this
again,
i
think,
is
congressman
walter
testifying,
and
he
doesn't
mentioned
anything
about
damage
to
the
personal
reputation
of
a
witness.
and
he
does
purport
to
set
out
there
what's
--
what
standards
are
taken
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
well,
they
begin
with
a
question
on
--
bottom
of
page
81,
“the
committee
does
sometimes
hold
executive
sessions,
doesn't
it?”
“yes”.
and
what
are
the
considerations
which
the
committee
uses
in
determining
whether
to
hold
executive
sessions?
justice
potter
stewart
than
the
rule
itself?
