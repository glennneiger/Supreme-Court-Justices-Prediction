mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
here
was
convicted
of
a
violation
of
section
192
of
title
18
for
contempt
of
congress
for
his
failure
to
answer
four
questions
put
by
a
subcommittee
of
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities
at
a
hearing
held
in
gary,
indiana
in
february
of
1958.
the
alleged
subject
under
inquiry
was
communist
infiltration
at
the
basic
industry
and
it
was
the
10th
investigation
that
the
committee
has
held
on
that
subject.
the
petitioner
testified
in
between
the
watkins
and
the
barenblatt
decisions
of
this
court
and
then
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
put.
he
relied
on
what
he
conceived
to
be
his
rights
under
the
watkins
decision.
he
also
cited
the
vagueness
of
the
authorizing
resolution,
his
rights
as
he
conceived
them
to
be
under
the
first
amendment,
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
committee
over
the
subject
of
the
inquiry.
he
did
not
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment.
he
was
not
tried
until
after
the
barenblatt
decision
and
he
was
found
guilty
on
all
four
counts
and
received
the
maximum
sentence
possible
under
the
statute
namely
one
year
in
jail.
prior
to
the
time
he
testified,
he
had
been
a
steelworker
employed
in
gary.
at
the
time
he
testified,
he
was
an
engineering
student
at
the
university
of
colorado,
subsequently,
received
a
fourth
foundation
grant
at
the
university
of
illinois,
he's
now
a
candidate
for
his
doctor's
degree
which
i
think
he
will
probably
receive
in
june.
each
one
of
these
section
192
cases
come
before
this
--
that
come
before
this
court
have
tracks
which
distinguish
this
--
this
case
from
all
of
the
other
cases
and
i'll
state
those
facts,
of
course.
but
i
should
like
to
state
in
all
conduct
that
the
constitutional
issues
in
this
case,
which
i
propose
to
raise
again,
are
indistinguishable
from
the
constitutional
issues
in
barenblatt,
wilkinson
and
braden.
and
i
propose
to
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
court
in
those
cases
should
be
reviewed
and
should
be
overruled.
the
petitioner
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
on
february
10th,
1958.
on
february
6th,
prior
to
the
hearing,
i,
who
was
representing
the
petitioner,
sent
a
telegram
to
the
counsel
for
the
committee
reading
as
follows,
"undersigned
represents
edward
yellin
and
nicholas
busic.
on
their
behalf,
i
request
executive
session
in
lieu
of
open
session.
testimony
needed
for
legislative
purposes
can
be
secured
in
executive
session
without
exposing
witnesses
to
publicity."
this
request
was
made
in
view
of
rule
iv
(a)
of
the
rules
of
the
committee
which
reads
as
follows,
"if
a
majority
of
the
committee
or
subcommittee,
duly
appointed
as
provided
by
the
rules
of
the
house
of
representatives,
believes
that
the
interrogation
of
a
witness
in
a
public
hearing
might
endanger
national
security
or
unjustly
injure
his
reputation
or
the
reputation
of
other
individuals,
the
committee
shall
interrogate
such
witness
in
an
executive
session
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
necessity
or
advisability
of
conducting
such
interrogation
thereafter
at
a
public
hearing."
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
had
never
appeared
on
executive
session,
no,
sir.
on
the
same
day,
i
received,
in
response
to
my
telegram,
a
telegram
signed
not
by
mr.
tavenner
to
whom
i
have
addressed
my
wire
but
a
telegram
signed
by
mr.
arens,
staff
director,
which
telegram
read
as
follows,
"reurtel
requesting
executive
session
in
lieu
of
open
session
for
edward
yellin
and
nicholas
busic.
your
request
denied."
at
the
hearing
in
gary,
i
sought
to
introduce
these
two
telegrams
into
the
record.
congressman
walter
who
was
residing
at
the
hearing
refused
to
accept
the
telegrams
into
the
record
and
in
the
conformity
with
normal
practice
at
congressional
hearings
refused
to
let
me
say
anything.
he
testified
at
the
trial,
and
at
that
time
he
stated
that
he
had
never
seen
the
telegrams.he
had
no
idea
at
all
as
to
what
was
in
them.
he
said
that
he
thought,
and
i
quote,
"they
were
more
or
less
in
the
nature
of
a
request
to
postpone
without
grounds."
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
said
that
he
hadn't
seen
the
telegrams
until
he
got
on
the
stand
at
the
trial
in
gary
two
or
three
years
later.
he
said
all
of
this
was
a
big
misunderstanding
that
i
made
a
mistake
in
sending
the
telegram
to
mr.
tavenner,
that
i
should
have
sent
the
telegram
to
him.
arens,
he
said,
had
no
authority
to
deny
such
a
request.
he
said,
and
i
quote
again,
"i
am
sure
this
could
not
have
happened,
had
you
addressed
your
telegram
to
me.had
he
knew
one
of
the
request?"
he
said,
and
i
quote
again,
"we
might
have
a
different
situation
today."
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
the
first
portion
comes
at
record
page
70.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
this
is
the
testimony
after
trial,
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
this
is
mr.
walker.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
mr.
walter,
congressman
walter
testified.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
and,
of
course,
of
the
committee
as
well.
and
he
said
at
that
time
that
long
time
ago
when
they
decided
to
call
mr.
yellin,
they
had
decided
considered
the
question
of
an
executive
session,
i
had
decided
not
to
call
him
an
executive
session.
the
reason
that
they
had
decided
not
to
call
him
in
an
executive
session
was
that
they
had
received
the
report
from
mr.
collins,
a
former
f.b.i.
agent,
who
was
an
investigator
for
the
committee.
and
i
quote
from
page
70
of
the
record,
"his
story
was
that
this
man
was
a
known
communist,
that
he
had
been
active
in
the
international
conspiracy,
that
he
had
deceived
his
employer.
and
furthermore,
he
came
within
the
category
of
those
people
that
we
were
experiencing
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
finding
out
about
with
respect
to
the
colonization."
question,
"did
you
assume
from
mr.
collins'
report
that
mr.
yellin
would
be
a
witness
who
would
refuse
to
give
information
to
the
committee?"
answer,
"we
had
no
way
of
knowing."
question,
"well,
what
conclusions
did
you
draw
from
the
report
of
mr.
collins
which
you
have
just
related?"
answer,
"we
concluded
that
this
would
be
a
fine
witness
for
the
committee
in
support
of
proposed
legislation
having
to
do
with
colonization
and
two,
having
to
do
with
the
protection
of
our
defense
efforts
and
it
is
always
worth
the
chance
that
somebody
will
testify."
question,
"but
wasn't
it
worth
the
chance
of
calling
him
an
executive
session
to
see
what
his
position
would
have
been?"
answer,
"i'm
sure
that
had
you
communicated
this
whole
matter
to
the
committee
before
we
left
washington
so
that
we
should
--
could
have
given
the
due
consideration,
we
would
have
and
always
do,
we
might
have
a
different
situation
today."
i
then
said,
"well,
i
raised
it
at
the
hearing.
couldn't
you
have
called
an
executive
session
right
then
and
there?"
and
he
said,
"well,
i
didn't
know
what
was
in
these
telegrams.
i
thought
you
were
just
asking
for
postponement."
and
then
i
said,
at
page
71
of
the
record,
"when
did
you
first
learn
that
i
had
made
an
application
for
an
executive
session?"
answer,
"i
believe
today.
i'd
never
seen
these
telegrams,
actually.
i
heard
you
mention
them,
at
least
now
my
recollection
is,
i
heard
you
mention
them
but
i
haven't
seen
them
until
this
minute."
and
then
subsequently,
at
rule
--
at
page
72,
he
says
that
as
i
say,
if
he
had
known
of
the
request,
we
might
have
a
different
situation
today.
now
--
it's
rather
unjust
to
send
them
in
to
jail
for
a
year
because
of
the
misunderstanding
with
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
who
wasn't
sufficiently
interested
to
read
the
telegrams
which
were
--
which
i
was
attempting
to
present
to
him
at
the
hearing.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
at
the
opening
of
the
hearing,
the
witness
identified
himself
and
this
is
--
well,
i
--
i
think
that
the
hearing
is
attached
to
the
record
that
--
that
is
the
printed
transcript,
it's
attached
to
the
record
that
your
honors
have.
it
appears
at
page
1974
of
the
printed
record
which
should
be
an
appendix
to
what
your
honors
have.
and
mr.
yellin
was
asked
about
his
name
and
where
he
lives
and
then
i
said,
"mr.
counsel,
i
wonder
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
read
into
the
record
the
exchange
of
telegram
--
telegrams
between
myself
and
the
committee
in
connection
with
the
witness's
testimony.
i
would
like
to
have
it
appear
in
the
record.
"the
chairman
said,
"we
will
decide
whether
it
will
be
made
a
part
of
the
record
when
the
executive
session
is
held."
congressman
walter
said
that
no
executive
session
ever
was
held.
"go
ahead."
and
then
i
said,
"mr.
chairman,
i
sent
the
telegram
because
i
wanted
them
to
appear.
i
don't
care
whether
they
appear
publicly
or
not.
i
do
want
it
to
appear
that
the
exchange
of
telegrams
occur.
i
didn't
do
it
just
to
increase
the
revenue
of
the
telegram
company."
and
the
chairman
said,
"well,
whatever
the
reason
was,
whether
it's
been
stated
or
otherwise,
it
will
be
considered
in
executive
session."
i
then
said,
"may
i
state?"
and
the
chairman
said,
"do
not
bother.
you
know
the
privileges
given
you
by
this
committee.
you
have
appeared
before
often
enough.
you
know
as
well
as
anybody.
go
ahead,
mr.
tavenner."
and
i
know
from
having
appeared
before
this
committee
on
previous
occasions
that
this
is
usually
the
prelude
to
the
possibility
that
counsel
will
be
asked
to
leave
the
witness
room
--
the
hearing
room
and
so
i
used
my
discretion
and
i
sat
down.
i
would
like
to
note
first
that
the
standards
used
by
mr.
walter
in
applying
rule
iv
of
the
committee
were
quite
different
from
the
standards
used
by
the
committee,
standard
set
forth
in
the
rules
rather.
the
rules
say
that
an
executive
committee
shall
be
held
when
the
committee
believes
that
the
interrogation
of
a
witness
in
a
public
hearing
might
endanger
national
security
or
unjustly
injure
his
reputation.
congressman
walter,
in
his
testimony
at
page
70,
said
that
they
had
decided
to
hear
mr.
yellin
at
a
public
session
instead
of
an
executive
session
because
the
man
was
a
known
communist.
he'd
been
active
in
the
international
conspiracy.
he
had
deceived
his
employer.
and
then
he
came
within
a
category
of
those
who
might
give
information.
now,
the
government
has
responded
to
this
by
saying
that,
well,
under
the
rules,
no
one
has
a
right
to
an
executive
session.
and
i
suppose
that
that
is
probably
true.
i
do
submit,
however,
that
under
the
rules,
everyone
has
a
right
to
a
good
faith
consideration
of
a
request
for
an
executive
session.
such
a
request
was
made.
it
was
communicated
from
counsel
to
counsel,
which
is
the
normal
way
of
communication
between
parties
to
litigation
or
what,
this
possible
potential
litigation.
and
there
was
no
good
faith
or
any
other
kind
of
consideration
given
to
the
request
in
this
instance.
the
committee
is
bound
by
its
rules.
this
court
has
frequently
so
held.
and
i
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
here,
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
a
good
faith
consideration
of
his
application.
he
never
received
any
consideration
of
his
application
either
in
good
faith
or
otherwise
and
that
these
grounds
alone
are
sufficient
for
our
reversal
here.
i
would
like
next
to
move
to
a
problem
that
is
raised,
i
think
inherently,
in
all
of
the
cases
since
the
barenblatt
decision,
although
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
has
ever
addressed
itself
to
it
as
fully
as
i
would
like
to
have
the
court
address
itself
to
it
on
this
occasion.
in
the
barenblatt
case,
the
court
used
this
language.
when
first
amendment
rights
are
asserted
to
bar
governmental
interrogation,
resolution
of
the
issue
always
involves
a
balancing
by
the
courts
of
competing
private
and
public
interests
at
stake
in
the
particular
circumstances
shown.
i
cannot,
as
a
philosophical
matter,
accept
the
balancing
theory
at
all
but
as
i
think,
one
of
the
members
of
this
court
said,
assuming
what
i
cannot
assume
namely
that
the
balancing
theory
is
what
we
are
to
adopt
here.
i
was
confronted
at
the
trail
of
his
case
of
following
the
rule
that
the
court
had
laid
down
in
the
barenblatt
case
and,
therefore,
i
address
myself
to
the
question
of
balancing.
what
are
we
balancing
here?
the
court
first
speaks
in
terms
of
the
competing
private
and
public
interests
at
stake
in
the
particular
circumstances
shown.
to
me,
that
sounds
like
this
is
the
question
of
fact
to
be
determined
in
each
case
in
accordance
with
the
particular
circumstances
in
each
case.
now,
it's
hard
and
i
was
puzzled
about
how
to
address
myself
to
this
problem
but
it
wasn't
my
language
and
it
wasn't
my
ruling,
it
was
this
court's
ruling.
and
so
at
the
trial,
i
attempted
to
address
myself
to
this
question,
what
are
we
balancing?
what
are
the
elements
and
the
scale?
and
what
way
are
we
to
assign
to
each
of
these
elements?
who
was
to
decide
this
question?
the
barenblatt
decision
says
resolution
of
the
issue
always
involves
a
balancing
by
the
courts.
and
so
the
courts,
presumably,
in
the
first
instance,
the
trial
court
has
to
balance
these
issues.
now,
part
of
the
question
is
easy.
on
the
one
side
of
the
balance
is
the
public
interest
in
national
security.
how
much
weight
is
to
be
given
to
that
side
of
the
scale?
is
it
possible
that
each
judge
reads
the
morning
newspapers,
decides
how
much
protection
the
national
interest
requires
this
day
or
this
year
and
then
ascribes
in
some
way
and
this
becomes
almost
a
metaphysical
problem,
how
much
weight
he's
going
to
give
to
the
--
to
that
aspect
of
the
national
security?
or
is
this
a
question
of
fact
that's
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
evidence
which
is
presented
in
court?
since
the
first
possibility
seem
to
me
inconceivable,
i
address
myself
to
the
second
and
i
attempted
to
or
for
evidence
in
court
as
to
the
nature
of
the
national
security
interest
involved
and
how
much
weight
should
be
given
to
it.
and
i
could
think
of
no
better
way
to
approach
to
this
problem
than
to
present
expert
testimony
on
it
and
that's
what
i
tried
to
do.
i
presented
an
expert
witness.
it
was
professor
thomas
i.
emerson,
professor
of
law
at
yale
university,
who
has
devoted
the
last
10
or
15
years
of
his
life
to
a
discussion
of
problems
involving
freedom
of
speech
and
national
security
and
their
impact
on
each
other.
and
i
offered
him
as
an
expert
witness
on
the
question
of
how
much
weights
to
be
given
to
part
of
this
of
this
--
on
the
scale
that
--
to
solve
this
factual
problem.
his
testimony
was
excluded.
the
court
said
this
was
not
a
proper
subject
or
testimony
in
court.
the
court
of
appeals
later
said,
this
is
a
question
of
law
to
be
decided
by
the
court
and
therefore
the
exclusion
of
the
testimony
was
proper.
i
don't
understand
what
that
means.
but
in
any
event,
professor
emerson's
testimony
was
--
was
excluded
as
i
say,
however,
it
does
appear
in
the
record
as
an
offer
of
proof
and
it
can
be
read
by
the
court
at
pages
91
to
114
inclusive
and
in
our
opinion,
it
should
have
been
admitted.
i'm
now
addressing
myself
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
i'm
not
addressing
myself
to
whether
it
proves
the
case
that
i
was
trying
to
prove
but
rather
to
the
admissibility
of
it.
and
i
submit
that
the
court
was
in
error
in
excluding
that
testimony.
the
second
thing
that
i
tried
to
do
in
meeting
this
question
of
how
much
weight
has
to
be
given
to
the
national
interest
was
to
attempt
to
prove
at
the
trial
that
the
information
that
was
sought
of
the
petitioner
by
the
questions
which
are
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry,
which
are
the
subject
matter
of
the
indictment
here,
that
these
questions
were
trivial,
that
they
will
miniscule,
that
they
were
so
unimportant
that
even
if
they
were
placed
in
this
scale,
they
wouldn't
amount
too
much.
it
is
conceited
now
that
as
to
two
of
the
questions,
namely,
"where
did
you
reside
in
1957
and
were
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1949"
were
corroborative,
corroborative
of
information
that
was
already
in
the
files
of
the
committee.
the
other
two
questions,
which
were
questions
formed
in
this
jargon
that
the
committee
has
developed,
"what
do
you
know
about
colonization
in
the
steel
industry?"
incidentally,
i
object
to
those
questions
on
the
ground
that
this
word
"colonization"
is
a
peculiar
word
of
ought
that
experts
and
the
committee
know
but
the
witnesses
at
a
congressional
committee
aren't
necessarily
required
to
brush
up
on
but
of
course
it
was
given
concurrent
sentence
so
even
if
i
win
on
those
two
questions,
i
haven't
won
my
case.
in
any
event,
it
was
my
argument
that
these
two
questions
relating
to
colonization
in
basic
industry
had
been
the
subject
of
testimony
at
nine
prior
hearings
in
buffalo,
in
flint,
in
new
orleans,
in
denver,
in
baltimore,
all
over
the
united
states.
now,
with
three
or
four
other
witnesses
who
cooperative
fully
at
the
gary
hearing
until
the
great
deal
about
this
subject
and
that
therefore
this
testimony
on
these
two
questions
was
cumulated.
now,
the
government
says,
and
i
think
the
government
is
right,
that
even
corroborative
questions
and
even
cumulative
questions
are
pertinent
because
they're
corroborative
or
cumulative.
they
maybe
pertinent,
but
they
don't
weigh
much.
they
have
no
great
weight
in
the
balance
which
this
court
has
directed
should
be
struck
in
each
particular
circumstance.
that
is
the
point
of
my
argument
with
respect
to
these
questions.
now,
what's
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance?
to
balance
the
public
interest,
the
national
security,
the
weight
to
which
we
still
don't
know
and
how
much
weight
is
to
be
given
to
those
interests.
i
think
we
can
agree
here
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
scale
are
those
great
rights
that
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
the
right
of
privacy,
the
right
of
free
speech,
the
right
of
assembly
and
above
all,
and
most
important
of
all,
the
right
of
the
public
to
hear
a
debate
of
the
important
issues
that
are
confronting
the
world
today
and
confronting
the
united
today
--
united
states
today
in
an
open
society
without
fear
of
a
subpoena
from
a
congressional
committee.
those
are
the
rights
on
the
other
side
of
the
scale.
i
cannot
believe
that
the
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
cases
can
be
explain
by
the
feeling
of
any
member
of
this
court
that
those
first
amendment
rights
are
unimportant
or
that
they
don't
require
protection.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
has
protected
those
rights
and
has
protected
them
very
effectively
in
cases
like
naacp
against
louisiana,
bates
against
little
rock,
shelton
against
tucker
and
others.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
thank
you
sir.
at
the
close
of
the
session
yesterday,
i
was
discussing
the
balancing
theory
which
has
been
adopted
by
this
court
in
the
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
and
other
similar
cases
and
was
pointing
to
what
i
felt
was
a
conflict
between
the
doctrine
that
had
been
applied
in
these
cases
and
the
doctrine
that
had
been
applied
or
the
results
at
least
that
had
been
reached
in
cases
decided
contemporaneously
such
as
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
against
louisiana,
bates
against
little
rock,
shelton
against
tucker
and
a
few
others
involving
the
integration
of
problem
in
the
cell.
may
i
with
all
due
respect
to
this
court,
suggest
that
perhaps
the
explanation
of
the
barenblatt
line
of
decisions
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
ideas
and
the
speech
in
the
assembly
which
was
seeking
protection
in
those
cases
were
ideas,
speech
in
assembly
which
we
hate
and
which
we
abhor?
well,
the
ideas
that
were
seeking
protection
and
the
assembly
that
was
seeking
protection
invades
shelton,
the
louisiana
case
and
the
others
are
ideas
which
today
we
find
tolerable
and
in
some
cases
even
attractive.
this
of
course
is
not
a
permissible
application
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
if
that
amendment
is
to
be
given
significant
content.
it
is
contrary
to
a
long
line
of
decisions
running
back
to
the
days
of
judge
brandeis
and
i'm
not
going
to
quote
to
your
honors
language
which
is
very
familiar
to
you
from
decisions
by
judge
brandeis,
by
judge
jackson,
by
judge
black,
in
richards
against
california
and
in
many
other
cases
and
by
judge
holmes
of
course.
all
of
them
have
pointed
out
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
give
protection
to
the
ideas
that
we
abhor
and
that
unless
that
it
is
given
that
interpretation,
the
amendment
has
no
a
very
significant
meaning.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
sir.
well,
no
sir.
i
don't
have
to
overrule
barenblatt
to
succeed
in
this
case.
i
think
that
i
have,
as
i
previously
indicated,
a
reversible
--
reversible
error
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
failure
to
grant
an
executive
session.
i
believe
further
that
i
have
reversible
error
and
that
the
court
refused
to
admit
the
testimony
of
professor
emerson
on
the
balancing
theory.
and
i
believe
further
that
within
the
bounds
of
barenblatt
and
within
the
bounds
of
the
balancing
theory
which
is
i
said
before,
i
am
assuming
although
i
cannot
agree
with
it,
that
on
balance
in
this
case
unlike
what
the
court
felt
was
the
situation
in
barenblatt.
on
balance
in
this
case,
the
balance
lies
on
the
side
of
the
petitioner
and
on
the
side
of
the
great
first
amendment
rights
which
our
for
the
protection
of
public
discussion
in
the
united
states
rather
than
on
the
other
side
of
the
scale
which
your
honor
has
held
in
barenblatt,
must
be
weighed
against
the
public
and
private
interest
on
the
other
side.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh
i
think
congress
of
the
united
states
has
power
to
investigate
on
the
field.
no
one
is
challenging
the
right
of
congress
to
call
witnesses
to
take
testimony,
it
has
called
hundreds
of
witnesses
who
have
given
testimony
voluntarily,
given
testimony
freely,
have
given
a
tremendous
amount
of
testimony
and
even
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh
i'm
asking
you
to
overrule
barenblatt
but
i
haven't
gotten
to
that.
i
was
just
about
to
come
to
that
point
now.
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
in
its
constitutional
issues,
i
feel
that
this
case
is
undistinguishable
from
barenblatt.
and
from
now
on,
shall
we
say,
i
am
asking
the
court
to
overrule
barenblatt
although
i
do
not
believe
that
anything
i
have
said
up
to
this
point
requires
the
overruling
of
barenblatt
but
rather
it
requires
an
application
of
the
balancing
theory
which
will
throw
the
balance
in
this
case
in
the
other
way,
and
i'm
not
arguing
what
should
have
been
--
how
the
balance
should
have
been
thrown
in
the
other
cases
because
those
other
cases
are
not
here
nor
do
i
represent
those
other
petitioners.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
constitutional
issues
which
as
i
say
call
for
a
reversal
of
barenblatt.
i
have
prepared
an
argument
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
and
i
had
intended
to
show
first
that
the
charter
of
the
committee
rule
11
was
unconstitutionally
vague
and
that
it
was
improper
to
attempt
to
give
it
meaning
by
a
search
of
legislative
history
at
least
in
a
criminal
case.
however,
proper
that
might
be
for
historical
or
other
purposes.
i
had
intended
to
argue
further
that
since
the
committee
by
its
charter
was
limited
to
investigation
of
un-american
propaganda
and
even
assuming
that
we
could
assign
a
meaning
to
that
somewhat
vague
expression.
it
would
give
the
committee
the
power
to
investigate
speech
because
propaganda
is
merely
another
word
for
speech,
and
that
that
was
improper.
i
had
intended
to
argue
that
this
particular
hearing
had
nothing
to
do
with
propaganda
anyhow.
and
i
had
intended
to
argue
further
that
this
was
a
good
case
of
exposure
for
exposure
sake.
after
preparing
all
of
this
argument
with
great
diligence,
i
reread
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
barenblatt
case
and
i
found
that
everything
that
i
had
intended
to
say
were
said
in
that
dissent
or
almost
everything
i
have
intended
to
say
were
said
in
that
dissent.
and
for
me
to
repeat
all
of
the
arguments
that
were
made
there
and
the
decision
that
was
handed
down
only
i
think
two
and
a
half
years
ago,
what
i
think
to
be
a
--
in
position
on
the
court,
it
would
be
merely
repeating
arguments
and
words
which
i
have
thought
--
sure
the
court
is
fully
familiar
with
and
i
would
not
omit
a
word
within
if
i
have
--
with
permission
of
the
author
of
the
opinion,
i
would
like
to
incorporate
that
dissent
so
as
to
speak
by
reference
into
this
argument.
if
i
may
however,
at
the
risk
perhaps
of
"gilding
the
lily"
add
just
a
few
words
to
what
was
said
in
that
dissent.
the
dissent
was
written
in
1959.
in
the
two
and
half
years
that
have
passed
since
that
date,
the
process
of
the
expansion
and
the
growth
of
the
seeds
planted
in
aca
against
douds
against
which
the
dissent
won
in
aca
against
douds
and
won
again
against
in
the
barenblatt
case.
those
seeds
have
continued
to
expand
and
the
doctrine
of
aca
against
douds
has
continued
to
apply
further
and
further
so
that
we
have
had
since
barenblatt,
the
braden
case,
the
wilkinson
case
in
the
specific
area
of
congressional
committees,
the
scales
case,
suppressive
activities
control
board
case
and
perhaps
four
or
five
other
decisions
generally
in
the
area
of
the
rights
of
communist.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
addressed
to
the
question
of
exposure
for
exposure
sake
which
is
also
discussed
in
the
barenblatt
decision
and
in
other
decisions
as
well.
i
would
like
to
note
here
the
failure
of
the
committee
to
grant
an
executive
session
which
i
have
already
noted
as
an
indication
of
the
purpose
of
this
committee
in
seeking
to
call
people
before
it
for
the
purpose
of
exposing
them.
in
the
course
of
the
hearing
mr.
tavenner
said
he
didn't
interview
the
petitioner
in
advance
to
find
out
what
his
testimony
would
be
because
he
didn't
think
the
witness
would
cooperate,
that's
perhaps
another
way
of
saying
that
he
didn't
call
--
he
didn't
subpoena
the
witness
in
advance
because
he
didn't
think
the
witness
would
testify.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
calling
witnesses
in
a
congressional
investigation
with
the
knowledge
of
understanding
or
belief
that
they
aren't
going
to
testify
is
the
proper
way
to
conduct
the
legislative
investigation;
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
get
information
and
not
to
expose
persons
for
their
political
belief.
in
this
case,
the
committee
had
a
great
deal
of
information
on
the
situation
in
gary.
it
had
several
so-called
cooperative
witnesses
in
gary.
it
called
about
ten
other
witnesses
and
as
i
have
said
before,
it
had
engaged
in
nine
previous
investigations
on
this
general
subject
and
the
only
difference
between
this
hearing
and
let
us
say,
the
hearing
in
buffalo
was
that
one
hearing
was
in
buffalo
and
the
other
was
in
gary.
but
for
legislative
purposes,
the
fact
adduced
in
both
of
those
hearings
was
identical.
i
would
like
to
add
just
a
few
words,
they're
not
in
the
record
before
this
court
but
they
are
matters,
i
believe
of
public
record
or
most
of
them
are,
as
to
what
happened
after
this
hearing.
as
i
said
before,
the
petitioner
received
the
fourth
foundation
grant
to
study
at
the
university
of
illinois.
when
the
appearance
before
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
he
was
originally
a
graduate
of
the
university
of
colorado
and
he
did
--
is
now
doing
graduate
work
at
illinois.
he
received
the
fourth
foundation
grant
of
the
university
of
illinois
and
when
this
appearance
before
the
congressional
committee
came
to
the
attention
of
the
faculty
at
illinois,
an
investigation
was
held,
the
dean,
after
a
great
deal
of
campus
activity
on
the
subject
and
much
distress
to
the
petitioner,
the
dean
after
a
faculty
investigation,
found
that
the
petitioner
had
returned
in
good
faith
to
the
academic
world.
subsequently,
he
received
a
nat
--
national
science
foundation
grant.
this
came
to
the
attention
of
congressman
scherer,
who
made
several
speeches
on
the
floor
of
congress
about
how
these
persons
who
had
refused
to
testify
before
the
committee
had
received
government
aid
and
as
a
result
of
those
features,
the
national
science
foundation
grant
was
revoked
so
that
the
committee
even
after
the
hearing
has
been
pursuing
its
exposure
purposes.
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
one
more
thing
and
with
this,
i
shall
close.
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
is
i
believe
not
the
right
of
the
petitioner
to
belong
to
the
organization
he
wants
to
or
to
speak
or
to
remain
silent.
the
most
important
right
is
the
right
of
the
public
to
hear
what
he
or
whatever
people
may
have
to
say.
and
it
is
here
that
our
democracy
faces
its
greatest
threat
because
today,
while
we
have
some
degree
of
democratic
discussion
on
high
intellectual
levels
among
people
who
are
secure,
there
is
no
free
in
democratic
discussion
among
the
masses
of
the
people
on
the
great
issues
of
the
day.
and
this
is
largely
because
of
fear.
would
you
advocate
peace?
two
years
ago,
20
or
30
members
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i'm
about
to
expand
on
it
sir.
would
you
advocate
peace?
20
or
30
years
ago
--
20
--
two
years
ago,
20
or
30
members
of
the
committee
for
saying
nuclear
policy
would
call
before
a
congressional
committee
and
examined
extensively
on
their
political
beliefs.
would
you
advocate
a
change
in
our
policy
to
a
cuba?
last
week,
this
very
committee
announced
that
it
was
traveling
to
los
angeles
for
the
purpose
among
others
of
subpoenaing
members
in
los
angeles
of
a
committee
called,
"the
committee
for
fair
play
for
cuba."
would
you
advocate
abolition
of
the
committee?
i
merely
called
to
your
attention
the
decision
in
the
wilkinson
case.
on
the
great
issue
of
the
recognition
of
china,
there
is
hardly
anyone
to
subpoena.
we
have
to
go
back
into
history
to
examine
what
happened
to
the
institute
of
pacific
relations.
the
amerasia
affair,
the
prosecutions,
two,
i
believe
they
were
of
professor
lattimore
(ph).
would
you
advocate
socialism?
there
is
the
threat
of
the
subversive
activities
control
board
which
may
find
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
which
may
find
your
organization;
a
communist
action
organization,
a
communist-infiltrative
organization,
a
communist
dominated
organization
and
i
hate
to
predict
what
maybe
the
next
kind
of
organization,
perhaps
a
communist
mislead
organization.
would
you
engage
in
the
theoretical
discussion
of
communism?
last
year,
i
believe
it
was
or
two
years
ago,
this
committee
held
an
investigation
of
a
foundation
which
gave
grants
to
theoretical
discussion
of
marxism
and
also
called
before
it
a
group
of
teachers
who
are
teaching
at
a
school
of
marxist
studies
in
new
york.
furthermore,
this
situation
is
not
getting
any
better.
at
least
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
lawyer
who
reads
the
advanced
sheets
of
this
court,
it
seems
to
be
getting
worse.
such
a
situation
would
have
been
serious
enough
50
years
ago
but
in
the
dynamic
world
of
today,
it
poses
a
very
serious
threat
to
our
existence
as
a
free
and
democratic
nation.
there
is
today
a
world
wide
debate
going
on,
all
over
the
world,
vietnam,
in
argentina,
western
europe,
cuba,
in
africa,
a
debate
on
the
relative
merits
of
two
great
opposing
forces,
two
great
social
systems.
i
suppose
for
a
shorthand
purposes,
we
can
say
the
capital
system
of
free
enterprise
and
the
socialist
system
of
a
planned
and
controlled
society.
unless
our
people
can
debate
this,
and
debate
this
not
nearly
in
the
magazine
section
of
the
new
york
times
but
debate
them
in
their
trade
unions,
on
the
street
corners,
in
their
clubs,
in
their
political
parties.
we
are
acting
out
of
the
debate
and
as
the
democracy,
it
is
doubtful
as
to
whether
we
can
survive.
we
can't
survive
perhaps
as
a
military
machine
but
not
as
the
united
states
that
we
all
know
and
love.
in
this
atmosphere
of
fear
where
issues
are
debated
by
people
who
are
either
very
secure
or
most
people
not
being
secure
are
debated
only
with
the
fear
of
a
congressional
committee
subpoena
or
a
subversive
activities
control
board
prosecution.
free
debate
cannot
exist.
the
subpoena
may
never
come,
most
of
the
time
it
does
not
come.
the
prosecution
under
subversive
activities
controlled
act
usually
does
not
happen.
but
your
honors,
i
can
tell
you
that
in
the
last
year,
i
have
had
20
people
come
to
me
and
say,
"i
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
years
ago,
is
it
alright
for
me
to
use
my
passport
and
go
to
cuba?"
i'm
--
excuse
me,
can't
go
to
cuba
with
the
passport,
go
to
--
go
to
europe.
people
are
frightened
and
in
this
atmosphere
a
free
and
democratic
discussion
cannot
exist.
i
have
the
greatest
respect
for
this
court
of
course
and
it
is
because
i
have
such
great
respect
that
i
had
these
last
few
words.
i
cannot
say
that
this
court
is
responsible
for
all
of
this
that
has
happened.
but
i
think
that
if
the
record
is
examined
objectively,
it
must
be
said
that
it
bears
its
share
of
that
responsibility.
beginning
with
aca
against
douds,
to
dennis,
barenblatt,
wilkinson,
braden,
scales,
sacp
and
a
scour
of
other
cases,
this
court
has
thrown
its
not
uncon
--
inconsiderable
weight
on
what
i
feel
is
the
wrong
side,
had
it
not
done
so,
had
it
encouraged
and
supported
the
drive
to
political
conformity.
it
would
not
have
given
substance
to
what
one
member
of
this
court
has
referred
to
as
the
"black
silence
of
fear."
i
myself
feel
some
very
slight
responsibility
for
this.
some
years
ago,
longer
ago
than
i
care
to
remember,
i
argued
american
communications
association
against
douds
and
sometimes
i
think
that
had
i
been
a
better
pleader,
perhaps
i
would
have
won
the
case
and
all
of
these
wouldn't
have
happened.
perhaps,
i'm
now
seeking
redemption
for
my
small
sin.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
aca
against
douds
sir.
it
will
take
us
a
generation
or
two
to
get
out
of
the
utmost
of
fear
--
atmosphere
of
fear
to
which
we
have
been
passing.
i
hope
that
it
is
not
too
late
to
begin
now,
certainly,
it
is
not
too
early.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
would
like
first
to
go
into
this
executive
session
thing
because
i
think
the
facts
can
be
cleared
up.
mr.
walter
testified
that
at
some
time,
presumably
at
the
time
the
subpoenas
were
issued,
although
that
is
not
altogether
clear.
the
committee
had
decided
that
it
would
call
mr.
yellin
in
executive
session,
i
mean
in
public
session.
and
the
reason
he
said
was
that
this
man
was
a
communist.
he
had
deceived
his
employer
and
that
they
thought
they
had
--
they
had
a
lot
of
information
about
him.
now
of
course,
the
rule
does
not
list
these
reasons
as
reasons
for
an
executive
session.
the
rule
says
that
an
executive
session
shall
be
called
when
it
will
result
in
unjust
publicity
so
that
apparently
in
making
the
original
determination
to
call
mr.
yellin
and
15
other
people
i
suppose
in
public
rather
than
an
executive
session,
whatever
the
reasons
where
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
rule.
the
standard
used
by
the
committee
or
by
mr.
walter
in
making
this
determination
was
tended
that
i'm
not
included
in
the
rule
at
all.
then,
on
behalf
of
mr.
yellin,
i
sent
a
telegram
and
it
was
as
clear
as
anybody
ever
is
in
a
telegram.
i
asked
for
an
executive
session
and
i
said
that
the
reason
was
that
--
well,
i'll
quote,
“testimony
needed
for
a
legislative
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
it's
in
page
--
it's
in
the
record
at
page
37
but
it's
--
i
mean
at
page
287
(n)
but
it's
almost
illegible
there.
it's
in
my
record,
in
my
brief
rather
at
page
5,
the
--
the
copy
in
the
record
is
--
is
very
bad
reproduction.
testimony
needed
for
legislative
purpose
can
be
secured
in
executive
session
without
exposing
witnesses
to
publicity.
now,
this
raised
as
sharply
as
i
could.
i
thought
the
standard
that
was
set
forth
in
the
rule
which
says
that
a
--
an
executive
session
will
be
held
when
the
committee
feels
that
the
interrogation
of
a
witness
might
unjustly
injure
his
reputation
so
that
in
the
telegram,
the
rule
was
not
referred
to
by
number
but
it
seemed
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
telegram
was
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
committee,
the
rule.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
said
that
to
counsel
for
the
committee.
i
normally
in
dealing
with
--
opposing
parties
deal
with
counsel.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
tried
to
raise
it
at
the
hearing
but
i
was
told
to
sit
down
in
view
a
fashion
and
i
sat
down
because
i
have
found
that
the
better
practice
when
the
chairman
of
the
committee
tells
me
to
sit
down.
i
do
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
what
--
what
i
did
was
say
i
would
like
to
have
these
telegrams
in
the
record.
oh
that
was
the
formulation
that
--
that
i
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
this
telegram
that
i
just
read
together
with
the
answer
denying.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
said
there
has
been
an
exchange
of
telegrams
and
i
--
i
would
like
to
have
them
included
in
the
record
of
congressman
walter
in
effect
he
said
sit
down.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
what
i
said
was
mr.
counsel
--
addressing
myself
again
to
mr.
tavenner.
“mr.
counsel,
i
wonder
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
read
it
to
the
record
the
exchange
of
telegrams
between
myself
and
the
committee
in
connection
with
the
witness'
testimony.
i
would
like
to
have
it
appear
in
the
record.”
and
that
congressman
walter
without
reading
the
telegram
and
it
doesn't
appear
on
the
record
but
let
me
state
with
a
show
of
impatience
said,
“go
ahead.”
and
i
said,
“i
pressed
again
i
sent
the
telegrams.
i
want
them
to
appear.
i
want
to
--
i
want
it
to
appear
at
the
exchange
of
telegrams
occurred.”
and
he
said,
"you
know
the
privileges
given
by
this
committee
have
appeared
it
before
often
--
before
it
often
enough.
you
know
it
as
well
as
anybody,
go
ahead
mr.
tavenner,"
and
i
took
that
as
my
cue
to
sit
down
and
i
did
it.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
at
the
trial?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh
at
the
trial,
he
said
he
didn't
know
what
the
telegrams
were.
he
hadn't
seen
them
until
the
day
of
the
trial.
he
said
he
thought
it
was
an
application
for
an
adjournment
without
grounds
and
that
was
why
he
told
me
to
sit
down.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
at
the
trial
--
at
the
hearing,
i
did
not
say
this
is
a
request
for
executive
session.
i
had
assumed
that
since
i
had
set
the
telegrams
to
mr.
tavenner,
mr.
tavenner
was
standing
in
front
me
and
i
had
received
the
response
from
the
staff
director
of
the
committee
saying
that
the
request
was
denied
that
this
was
a
communication
between
me
and
the
committee
and
the
committee
knew
what
was
in
the
telegram
so
i
sent
them.
well,
i
got
an
answer.
i
confess
that
i
did
not
at
that
time
think
about
the
question
of
whether
within
the
internal
workings
of
the
committee,
mr.
arens,
who
conduct
about
half
of
these
hearings,
have
authority
to
deny
this.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no.
they're
not
in
the
record
at
all.not
in
the
record
of
the
hearing.
they
are
in
the
record
of
trial
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no
sir.
they
don't
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
they
weren't
turned
over
to
anybody.
i
sent
one
and
of
course
kept
an
office
copy
for
myself.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well
all
i
said
was,
i
wonder
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
read
it
to
the
record
of
exchange
of
telegrams.
i
had
the
--
my
office
copy
of
the
one
i
sent
then
i
have
the
original,
the
one
that
i
received,
and
i
wish
to
read
them
into
the
record
so
that
i
could
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
committee
the
fact
that
this
exchange
of
telegrams
had
occurred.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
it's
not
a
written
rule.
it's
just
a
rule
of
practice
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
rule
of
practices
that
counsel
shouldn't
talk
to
the
committee
but
should
only
talk
to
his
witness.
anytime
counsel
attempts
to
address
the
committee
at
any
of
these
hearings,
the
general
rule
is
except
to
stating
his
name.
the
general
rule
is
--
well,
it
varies
--
well,
it
depends
on
whether
mr.
walter
is
conducting
a
hearing
in
which
case
the
rules
are
very
strict,
though
mr.
doyle
was
conducting
a
hearings
in
which
case
the
rules
are
pretty
liberal,
mr.
doyle
being
less
a
impatient
man.
but
generally
speaking,
the
rule
is
that
counsel
is
not
supposed
to
talk
to
the
committee.
he
is
supposed
to
talk
only
to
his
witness,
to
his
client
and
that
of
course
is
a
whispered
conversation
that
takes
place
at
the
witness
table.
generally
speaking,
arguments
of
law
and
so
forth
and
so
on
are
supposed
to
be
made,
objections
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
committee
at
least
of
the
privilege
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
are
made
by
the
witness.
what
frequently
happened,
i
supposed
always
happens
in
practice
at
least
it
does
may
have
had
before
the
committee
is
that
counsel
reviews
this
with
the
committee,
with
the
witness
if
the
witness
is
good
enough.
he
recites
what
has
been
told
or
what
he
believes
ought
to
be
said.
if
not,
he
reads
the
statement
which
he
and
counsel
have
worked
out
in
advanced
and
the
situation
varies
in
a
great
deal.
in
mr.
yellin's
case,
you
can
tell
by
reading
the
transcript,
he
spoke
off
the
cop.
he
wasn't
thrown
up
constantly
and
he
argued
with
the
committee
as
to
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
so
forth.
in
--
as
we
will
see
in
the
silver
case,
mr.
silver
said,
“i
want
to
incorporate
by
reference
everything
that
the
previous
witness
said
because
the
previous
witness
had
read
a
long
statement.”
and
the
practice
in
this
respect
varies
but
one
thing
does
not
vary.
counsel
can't
do
anything
talking,
that's
clear.
now,
after
these
telegrams
were
read,
the
witness
proceeded
to
testify.
now,
counsel,
one
the
government
is
mistaken
in
one
respect.
he
stated
not
once
but
three
or
four
times
that
by
the
time
mr.
yellin
testified
there,
it
was
already
a
testimony
before
the
committee
that
he
was
a
communist.
that's
not
so.
the
first
witness
who
testified
was
mr.
lautner
who
never
heard
of
mr.
yellin
or
at
least
gave
no
indication
that
he
did.
mr.
yellin
was
the
second
witness.
there
were
subsequent
witnesses
who
identified
mr.
yellin
that
having
once
been
a
communist,
but
this
was
after
mr.
yellin
testified
and
not
before
it.
counsel
says
both
parties
were
at
fault.
i
suppose
that
the
witness
was
at
fault
because
he
didn't
send
the
telegram
quickly
enough,
at
least
that's
the
only
clue
that
i
can
think
of.
well,
the
witness
was
in
denver,
i
was
in
new
york,
the
hearing
was
in
gary,
the
committee
was
in
washington
and
it
isn't
easy
to
make
full
connection
quickly
under
those
circumstances.
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
have
sent
the
telegram
before
i
sent
the
telegram
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
under
circumstances
of
distance
that
were
involved
here,
as
soon
as
i
can
get
authorization
from
my
client
to
do
it
since
i
get
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
it
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
it
becomes
difficult
to
confer
with
the
witness
except
over
long
distance
telephone.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
could
discuss
with
him
the
reasons
why
such
a
telegram
--
why
you
think
such
a
telegram
ought
to
be
sent,
whether
he
would
like
to
appear
in
executive
session
first
and
some
of
the
questions.
and
as
i
say
i
--
i
know
that
theoretically
a
long
distance
telephone
conversation
is
as
good
as
a
face-to-face
conversation
but
it
rarely
is
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
i
believe
we
worked
it
out
in
the
--
i
don't
remember
frankly
how
much
time
allots
me
to
interview
the
day
he
was
served
with
the
subpoena.
i
don't
think
that
appears
on
the
record.
it
may
have
been
only
a
very
short
time
and
i
--
i
frankly
don't
recall.
(inaudible)
for
the
sake
of
--
of
argument
anyhow,
i
can
see
that
--
maybe
i
was
at
fault
here.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well
i
--
i
sent
it
for
counsel
for
the
committee.
i
didn't
know
mr.
walter
was
going
to
preside
it
this
hearing
and
normally
as
i
said
before,
i'm
an
attorney
and
in
dealing
with
opposing
parties,
i
ideal
with
attorneys
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
tavenner,
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
a
response
from
mr.
arens.
now,
mr.
arens,
title
was
staff
director
and
later
had
developed
and
mr.
walter
said,
he
never
had
any
authority
to
reject
this
and
this
was
all
the
misunderstanding
of
the
kind,
and
as
--
as
has
been
pointed
out
the
--
mr.
walter
said
that
at
one
point
--
mr.
walter
said,
"if
you
had
sent
the
telegram
to
me
or
perhaps
we
wouldn't
be
here."
now
one
--
one
that
appearing
at
page
--
record
--
record
page
69
he
said,
“i
am
sure
this
could
not
have
happened,
had
you
addressed
your
telegram
to
me?”
and
at
record
page
70
he
said,
if
he
had
known
of
the
request
for
an
executive
sessions
so
that
the
committee
could
have
given
the
due
consideration,
we
might
have
a
different
situation
today.
now,
maybe
it
was
a
little
bit
of
the
fault
of
the
committee
but
i'm
willing
to
excuse
both
faults.
i'll
excuse
the
fault
of
the
committee
and
they'll
excuse
my
fault.
i
don't
want
to
send
the
committee
to
jail.
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
be
punished
for
its
fault
but
i
don't
believe
that
my
client
ought
to
be
punished
for
his
fault
either.
and
if
we
would
at
fault,
this
is
a
criminal
trial
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
pretty
good
reason
for
letting
the
defendant
off.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
but
this
is
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
and
the
question
is
whether
his
rights
were
violated
in
connection
with
this
request
for
an
executive
session,
and
this
is
so
far
as
our
present
discussion
is
concerned,
the
reason
for
reversal
that
i
am
pressing.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
on
to
the
balancing
question
and
here
i
am
very
grateful
to
counsel
for
the
government
because
i
have
heard
here
for
the
first
time
what
i
assume
is
the
authoritative
government
view
out
of
what
the
balancing
rule
means.
express
--
i
must
confess
much
more
clearly
than
this
court
has
ever
expressed
it,
and
i
think
it's
a
clear
view.
i
think
it
--
it's
easy
to
apply.
i
think
it
destroys
much
of
the
first
amendment
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
ought
to
accept
it.
as
i
understand
the
situation,
the
court
has
decided
that
for
the
present
according
to
counsel,
the
public
interest
in
this
kind
of
investigation
is
overwhelming.
now,
i
don't
know
for
--
how
long
for
the
present
exists
and
i
don't
know
when
it
is
that
i
get
an
opportunity
to
show
that
the
present
has
changed.
now,
the
court
decided
in
barenblatt
on
the
basis
but
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
incidentally.
i
assume
the
court
did
it
by
taking
judicial
notice
of
the
threat
of
communist
subversion,
that
as
of
that
day,
the
threat
of
communist
subversion
was
so
great
that
the
congress
had
this
--
this
overpowering.
i
forgot
the
word
that
counsel
used
but
it
was
a
very
strong
one
overwriting
i
think
interest
in
--
in
this
investigation,
overwriting
government
interest
was
the
word
he
used.
but
when
does
it
change?
when
do
i
get
an
opportunity
to
show
that
this
situation
is
no
longer
overwriting?
that
fact
is
that
we
do
live
in
a
dynamic
world,
things
do
change.
i
tried
to
do
it.
i
tried
to
do
through
professor
emerson's
testimony.
what
did
he
say?
well,
he
said
he
doesn't
think
there's
much
threat
and
he
went
into
reasons.
he
said
there's
very
little
communism
for
once
in
the
trade-union
movement
today.
he
said
that
in
the
academic
world
as
far
as
he
knows,
there's
practically
no
communist
influenced.
he
said
that
most
communist
have
been
driven
out
of
the
government.
he
said
that
we
have
no
social
unrest
in
the
united
states
to
speak
off
or
that
the
social
unrest
that
does
exist
which
is
mostly
in
the
south.
it
does
not
seem
to
be
leaning
in
the
direction
of
communism
that
the
negroes
have
taken
other
methods
of
securing
redress
of
their
rights
and
that
there
appears
to
be
no
rebirth
or
--
or
strengthening
of
communism
in
the
south.
he
said
he
find
no
significant
opposition
by
way
of
another
political
party
to
the
major
political
party.
he
said
that
in
his
opinion
the
strength
of
the
communist
party
was
very
small
as
a
result
of
the
laws
that
it
did
pass
what
she
detailed.
he
found
that
there
was
very
little
religious
and
religious
institutions
very
little
communist
strength.
and,
the
situation
we
believe
has
changed.
when
do
we
get
a
chance
to
show
that
the
thing
has
change?
now,
just
one
word
more,
on
the
other
side
namely
the
right
of
the
individual,
his
side
of
the
scale
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
the
only
right
that
the
individual
has
is
that
the
committee
should
be
nice
to
him.
no
talk
about
free
speech,
no
talk
about
the
assembly,
no
talk
about
free
press,
no
talk
about
the
right
to
express
his
views,
he
just
is
entitled
to
be
treated
as
a
gentlemen
and
not
pillorying.
well,
i
think
this
is
reducing
the
first
amendment
to
rather
small
(inaudible).
thank
you.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
a
violation
of
section
192
of
title
2
for
his
refusal
to
answer
several
questions
put
to
him
by
a
subcommittee
of
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities
at
a
hearing
held
in
gary,
indiana
in
february
1958.
the
alleged
subject
under
inquiry
was
communist
infiltration
for
basic
industry.
and
it
was
the
tenth
investigation
that
the
committee
had
held
over
a
period
of
some
four
or
five
years
under
that
title,
to
say
nothing
of
course
of
hundreds
of
investigations
that
the
committee
has
held
on
related
subjects.
he
testified
between
the
watkins
and
the
barenblatt
decisions
of
this
court.
and
in
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
put
to
him,
he
expressly
relied
on
the
watkins’
decision
on
the
vagueness
of
the
authorizing
resolution
upon
his
rights
under
the
first
amendment
and
on
the
lack
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
committee
over
the
subject
under
inquiry.
like
barenblatt
and
braden
and
wilkinson
and
russell
and
the
other
cases
that
were
decided
by
this
court
at
the
last
term,
he
did
not
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment.
he
was
not
indicted
or
tried
until
after
the
barenblatt
case.
at
that
time
he
was
found
guilty
and
received
the
maximum
sentence
of
one
year.
prior
to
his
testimony,
he
had
been
a
steelworker.
at
the
time
of
his
testimony
before
the
committee,
he
was
an
undergraduate
engineering
student
at
colorado.
since
then
he
has
been
a
graduate
student
and
a
candidate
for
his
doctor’s
degree
at
the
university
of
illinois.
it
doesn’t
appear
in
the
record
of
course
but
the
fact
is
that
in
1961,
he
received
a
fellowship
from
the
national
science
foundation
which
was
taken
from
him
when
congressman
scherer
made
a
speech
about
it
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
and
in
1962,
he
received
the
fellowship
from
the
national
institutes
of
health
which
was
similarly
taken
from
him.
he
is
however
receiving
a
scholarship
from
johns
hopkins
university,
not
out
of
public
but
of
private
funds.
the
case
was
argued
at
the
last
term
and
is
now
here
on
reargument.
it
differs
from
the
russell
and
other
cases
that
were
decided
by
this
court
at
the
last
term
because
this
indictment
was
drawn
by
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana.
and
he
apparently
used
his
own
forms
for
drawing
an
indictment
and
did
not
fall
into
the
error
that
the
court
found
fatal
in
the
cases
decided
at
the
last
term.
i
shall
argue
both
constitutional
and
unconstitutional
grounds
for
reversal
here.
there
are
facts
in
this
case
that
were
not
present
in
barenblatt,
wilkinson
and
braden.
and
even
one
of
my
constitutional
arguments
may
not
require
a
reversal
of
barenblatt,
wilkinson
and
braden,
at
least
i
may
have
found
a
crevice
in
which
i
can
find
some
shelter.
but
if
i
have,
it’s
a
narrow
crevice
and
i
shall
ask
the
court
here
to
reconsider
the
barenblatt,
wilkinson,
and
braden
cases
because
i
suggest
that
those
cases
were
bad
law.
i
must
say
that
the
brief
on
reargument,
a
new
brief
on
reargument
submitted
by
the
government
in
this
case
gives
my
some
comfort
in
that
regard
because
i
think
that
the
government
recognizes
that
issues
such
as
these
are
never
finally
decided.
at
page
26
of
the
government
brief,
the
solicitor
general
says,
after
discussing
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson,
under
normal
circumstances
therefore
and
perhaps
in
the
present
instance,
it
would
be
enough
to
show
that
the
case
at
bar
is
indistinguishable
from
the
controlling
precedence.
we
are
mindful,
however,
that
the
present
controversy
involves
the
most
delicate
and
dangerous
of
the
court’s
responsibilities.
the
solicitor
general
then
goes
on
to
describe
what
those
delicate
and
dangerous
responsibilities
are,
i
disagree
with
that.
and
i’ll
come
back
to
that
a
little
later.
but
the
government
goes
on
to
say,
“for
these
reasons,
we
would
be
derelict
in
our
duty
despite
the
precedence”.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i’ll
come
to
the
reasons
in
a
few
minute
--
at
the
close
your
honor
because
i
think
that
the
reasons
are
very
important.
there
is
a
vital
difference
of
opinion
between
the
solicitor
general
and
i
myself
with
respect
to
the
reasons.
i
have
no
intent
to
omit
it,
i
will
show
you.
“for
these
reasons,
we
would
be
derelict
in
our
duty
despite
the
precedence
if
we
fail
to
show
in
some
detail
the
constitutional
foundation
for
the
congressional
investigation
into
the
subject.”
i
too
feel
that
there
are
delicate
and
dangerous
issues
involved
here
and
that
this
kind
of
issues
can
never
be
left
rest
as
certainly
the
history
of
this
court
has
shown.
let
me
state
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
just
a
new
reply
brief.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
petitioner
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
on
february
10th,
1958
in
gary.
on
february
6th,
counsel
sent
a
telegram,
addressed
to
counsel
for
the
committee
reading
as
follows,
“undersigned
represents
edward
yellin
and
nicholas
busic.
on
their
behalf
i
request
executive
session
in
lieu
of
open
session.
testimony
needed
for
legislative
purposes
can
be
secured
in
executive
session
without
exposing
witnesses
to
publicity”.
the
response
by
--
signed
by
mr.
arens,
the
staff
director
of
the
committee
read,
“reurtel
requesting
executive
session
in
lieu
of
open
session
for
edward
yellin
and
nicholas
busic.
your
request
denied”.
the
request
was
made
in
the
first
place
pursuant
to
rule
iv-a
of
the
rules
of
the
committee
on
un-american
activities
which
reads
as
follows:
“if
a
majority
of
the
committee
or
subcommittee,
duly
appointed
as
provided
by
the
rules
of
the
house
of
representatives,
believes
that
the
interrogation
of
a
witness
in
a
public
hearing
might
endanger
national
security
or
unjustly
injure
his
reputation,
or
the
reputation
of
other
individuals,
the
committee
shall
interrogate
such
witness
in
an
executive
session
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
necessity
or
advisability
of
conducting
such
interrogation
thereafter
in
a
public
hearing”.
at
the
hearing,
counsel
for
yellin
attempted
to
introduce
this
exchange
of
telegrams
into
the
record
so
that
the
matter
could
be
called
to
the
attention
of
the
committee
and
would
appear
in
the
record.
congressman
walter
who
was
presiding
refused
to
permit
counsel
to
address
the
committee
at
all.
at
the
trial,
he
said
that
he
never
saw
the
telegram.
he
didn’t
know
what
they
were.
he
didn’t
see
him
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
hadn’t
even
seen
them
until
he
got
on
the
stand
at
the
trial
and
when
i
showed
him
those
telegrams,
during
the
course
of
this
examination,
he
said,
that
was
the
first
time
he
saw
them.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no
sir.
in
the
view
of
congressman
walter’s
express
on
the
witness
stand,
this
was
all
a
big
misunderstanding.
he
said
the
telegram
should’ve
been
sent
to
him
and
not
to
the
counsel
for
the
committee.
moreover,
he
said,
mr.
arens,
who
denied
the
request,
had
no
authority
to
deny
any
such
request.
only
the
committee
had
the
authority
to
deny
such
a
request.
he
said
and
i
quote,
“i
am
sure
this
could
not
have
happened
had
you
addressed
the
telegram
to
me”.
he
further
said
that
he
had
he
known
of
the
request
for
an
executive
session,
“we
might
have
a
different
situation
today”.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
congressman
walter
said,
that
the
committee
had
concede
--
considered
calling
the
petitioner
on
executive
--
petitioner
an
executive
session.
and
this
appears
at
page
70
of
the
record.
and
he
said,
“well,
the
committee
had
already
passed
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
would
hear
mr.
yellin
at
a
session”,
when
the
purpose
of
calling
him
was
discussed.
then
it
was
decided
then
that
the
rule
with
respect
to
an
executive
session
was
not
applicable
because
the
investigator
and
i
might
say
it
was
mr.
collins,
a
former
fbi
agent,
who
developed
this
entire
matter.
and
we
were
willing
to
accept
his
story
with
respect
to
the
proposed
testimony.
i
gather
from
this
not
completely
clear
answer
that
congressman
walter
was
saying
that
an
executive
session
was
denied
because
they
had
a
very
reliable
investigator
and
they
were
prepared
to
take
his
word
for
what
the
witness
was
going
to
be
called
for
and
an
executive
session
was
therefore
not
necessary.
now,
that
of
course
is
not
the
standard
that
is
required
by
the
rules.
the
rules
say
that
an
executive
session
shall
be
called
when
in
the
opinion
of
the
committee,
the
interrogation
of
a
witness
at
a
public
hearing
might
endanger
national
security
or
unjustly
injure
his
reputation.
the
government
points
out
that
the
witness
has
no
right
to
an
executive
session
and
i
think
this
is
true.
the
witness
has
no
right
to
an
executive
session.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
rule
iv-a,
it
appears
at
page
4
of
my
brief.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
witness
has
no
right
to
an
executive
session,
but
i
respectfully
submit,
he
does
have
a
right
to
have
the
rules
apply.
and
that
means
in
this
circumstance,
that
he
has
the
right
to
have
his
request
considered
by
the
committee
and
to
have
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
rules
applied.
and
if
then
the
committee
decides
that
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
rules
do
not
require
an
executive
session,
it
may
very
well
be
that
it
will
deny
it.
here,
the
committee
was
never
given
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
matter
and
when
it
did
consider
the
question
of
executive
session,
the
standard
that
he
applied
--
that
it
applied,
bore
no
relationship
at
all
to
the
standard
that’s
set
forth
--
that
is
set
forth
in
the
rules.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
i
don’t
sir
but
i
would
guess
it
was
probably
some
ten
years
ago,
at
which
time
there
was
a
great
deal
of
criticism
of
the
committee
for
not
having
any
rules,
for
not
permitting
counsel
to
participate
and
the
set
of
rules
was
adopted
of
which
this
was
one.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i'll
be
glad
to
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
find
that
out
for
you,
but
i
might
say
that
this
of
course
is
a
rule
of
the
committee,
not
a
rule
of
the
house.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
would
presume
that
the
house
knew
about
it.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
his
test
--
he
did
not
testify
at
the
gary
hearings.
now,
whether
he
testified
an
executive
session
before
the
committee
at
some
other
occasion
or
he
testified
at
some
other
hearing,
i
don't
know.
he
did
not
testify
at
gary,
that
i
am
certain
of.
the
committee
is
bound
by
its
rules.
the
standard
set
by
the
rules
must
be
followed.
this
court
has
frequently
held
that
this
committee
as
well
as
other
government
agencies
when
they
adopt
rules
are
bound
by
them.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
little
misunderstanding
that
mr.
walker
--
mr.
walter
referred
to
is
not
sufficient
to
send
the
man
to
jail
for
a
year.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
alright,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
mr.
justice
stewart,
through
the
courtesy
of
solicitor
general
cox,
i
am
advised
that
the
rule
in
question
was
adopted
in
the
summer
of
1953
so
that
it
has
--
it
had
been
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
gary
readopted
by
successive
congresses
or
by
successive
committees
i
think
twice.
that
would
be
in
1954
and
1957.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
this
was
standing.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
believe
that
the
house
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
believe
that
the
house
does
go
through
what
is
in
most
cases
a
pro
forma
readoption
of
the
rules
reestablishing
each
committee
each
year
and
that
maybe
that
the
committee
(inaudible)
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
every
--
perhaps
every
congress.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
would
be
every
two
years.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes.
there
would
have
to
be
an
appropriation
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
every
congress,
if
not,
every
year
in
some
cases.
i
would
like
to
pass
on
next
to
what
is
a
constitutional
point
but
not
a
first
amendment
point,
rather
a
fifth
amendment
and
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
should
think
that
the
com
--
that
the
witness
would
have
the
right
to
have
an
application
--
to
have
his
application
considered
by
the
committee
when
he
makes
an
application.
now,
it
isn't
routine
that
a
witness
makes
an
application
but
i
should
think
that
when
a
witness
makes
an
application,
he's
entitled
to
have
it
considered
and
considered
on
the
basis
of
the
standards
that
are
set
forth
in
the
rule.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i'm
not
sure
really.
i
--
i'm
--
i
can't
--
i
suppose
that
when
an
--
a
litigant
makes
an
application
to
a
court,
the
court
has
to
make
a
ruling
on
it
or
ought
to
make
a
ruling
on
it
and
this
of
course
isn't
the
court.
but
i
should
think
that
the
committee
ought
to
consider
applications
that
are
made
to
it.
now,
of
course,
congressman
walter
said
that
such
a
consideration
had
been
given
to
it.
there
was
no
committee
record
or
minute
or
anything
else
that
was
introduced
to
that
effect
and
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
sir.
that's
the
one
that
i
have
read.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no.
congressman
walter
at
times
is
somewhat
irascible
and
when
counsel
attempt
to
speak.
he
generally
tells
them
in
one
formulation
or
another,
sit
down
or
you'll
be
thrown
out.
that
precisely
what
he
said
to
me
at
the
time,
i
said,
“i'd
like
to
introduce
these
records,”
and
he
said,
“you've
been
here
often
enough
to
rule
--
to
know
the
rules
of
this
committee,
sit
down”.
and
since
i
was
there
often
enough
to
know,
i
sat
down.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
had
them
in
my
hand
and
i
said,
“i
would
like
to
introduce
these,
that
i'd
like
to
read
them
into
the
record”.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
at
the
trial,
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
would
like
to
argue
next
that
the
statute
under
which
the
petitioner
was
convicted
was
unconstitutionally
vague
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
i
must
admit
that
this
record
was
inherent.
this
question
was
inherent
in
the
record
in
barenblatt,
wilkinson,
and
braden,
but
has
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
never
been
considered
by
any
majority
opinion
of
this
court.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
this
is
the
narrow
crevice.
it
was
not
argued
in
barenblatt
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
am
talking
about
the
statute
which
for
reasons
that
i
will
give
in
a
moment,
i
think
must
be
read
together
with
the
resolution.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
page
3.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
from
section
192,
yes
sir,
the
contempt
statute.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
not
sir.
i
think
not
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
not
exactly.
if
i
may
--
may
i
continue
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
because
i
think
that
that's
not
quite
so.
i
said
it
was
a
narrow
crevice
under
this.
nevertheless,
i
think
it's
a
perfectly
sound
point.
it
was
not
argued
in
barenblatt.
it
was
not
argued
in
wilkinson.
it
was
argued
in
braden
but
apparently
not
forcefully
enough
to
--
mr.
boudin
argued
it,
not
forcefully
enough
to
require
any
response
by
the
majority
of
the
court.
in
all
candor,
i
must
say
that
it
was
considered
and
considered
at
very
great
length
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
barenblatt
although
it
had
not
been
argued
in
that
case.
and
i
must
also
confess
with
candor
that
much
of
my
argument
is
cribbed
from
that
dissenting
opinion,
but
i
would
like
to
make
it
nevertheless.
the
government
points
out
that
section
192
reads
pretty
clearly
and
i
suppose
it
does,
every
person
who
having
been
summoned
as
a
witness
by
the
authority
of
either
house
of
congress
to
give
testimony
or
to
produce
papers
upon
any
matter
under
inquiry
before
the
house,
or
who
having
appeared
refuses
to
answer
any
question
pertinent
to
the
question
under
inquiry
shall
be
guilty
of
contempt.
the
rumely
case,
however,
interpreted
that
statute
as
applying
only
to
a
situation
in
which
the
question
is
asked
on
the
matter
concerning
which
the
committee
has
jurisdiction.
and
therefore,
that
statute
i
suggest,
must
be
read
as
meaning
that
a
witness
who
having
appeared
refuses
to
answer
any
question
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
committee
is
guilty
of
contempt.
that's
what
rumely
said.
and
therefore,
we
must
go
back
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
committee
in
order
to
ascertain
what
the
statute
means.
it's
analogous
to
a
statute
which
says
it
shall
be
a
violation
of
law
for
anyone
to
violate
the
regulation
of
the
state
department.
if
the
regulation
of
the
state
department
is
unclear,
the
statute
is
unclear.
now,
it
is
true
that
this
court
at
some
length
in
barenblatt
did
consider
the
meaning
of
rule
11,
the
authorizing
resolution.
and
as
a
result
of
rather
extensive
research,
all
of
which
appears
at
page
120
of
the
barenblatt
decision,
it
found
the
meaning
for
the
language
which
the
chief
justice
had
been
unable
to
find
in
the
watkins
case.
and
it
said
that,
as
i
understand
the
decision,
the
words
un-american
propaganda
activity
really
means
the
investigation
of
communist
activities
generally.
congressman
walter,
when
he
was
on
the
stand
at
gary,
expanded
this
a
little
bit.
he
said
that
the
words
“un-american
propaganda
activity”
means
and
i
quote,
“any
activity
that
is
inimical
to
the
best
interests
of
the
united
states”.
congressman
walter
is
the
ranking
democratic
member
of
the
judiciary
committee
and
i
should
think
that
his
views
on
the
subject
would
be
worthy
of
at
least
some
consideration.
i
am
not
disposed
at
this
time
to
argue
what
that
resolution
means.
we
are
--
i
am
not
arguing
now
the
question
of
pertinency.
i
am
not
now
arguing
the
question
of
whether
this
particular
investigation
was
within
the
scope
of
the
committee's
jurisdiction
as
that
jurisdiction
has
been
determined
by
this
court
to
be
in
barenblatt.
i
am
directing
myself
only
to
the
question
of
whether
this
statute
read
as
a
criminal
statute
with
rule
11
was
sufficiently
clear
and
certain
to
justify
to
be
able
to
sustain
a
criminal
conviction.
now,
i
submit
that
section
192
read
in
the
light
of
rumely
as
with
the
emendation
of
rule
11
does
not
meet
the
standards
of
--
retried
to
this
court
of
a
criminal
statute.
the
court
has
formulated
these
standards
on
many
occasions
and
let
me
just
refer
to
the
standard
applied
in
the
connelly
case.
the
statute
is
bad,
said
the
connelly
case,
if
and
i
quote,
“men
of
common
intelligence
must
necessarily
guess
at
its
meaning
and
differ
at
its
application”.
well,
men
of
uncommon
intelligence
have
been
compelled
to
guess
at
its
meaning
and
have
differed
in
its
application.
aside
from
congressman
walter,
this
court
has
divided
on
what
the
statute
means.
i
have
never
heard
of
a
case
and
the
government
cites
no
case.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
case
in
which
a
court
has
examined
the
legislative
history
in
order
to
uphold
a
conviction
on
a
criminal
statute.
and
it
seems
to
me
on
its
face
impossible.
if
a
statute
is
clear
on
its
face,
legislative
history
is
irrelevant.
and
if
a
statute
is
unclear
on
its
face,
a
criminal
statute
used
to
sustain
a
conviction,
then
most
certainly,
legislative
history
cannot
be
used
in
order
to
clarify
that
statute.
now
i
repeat,
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
whether
the
committee
had
jurisdiction
although
this
subject
under
inquiry
and
i
am
willing
although
i
don't
think
it
did,
nevertheless,
i
am
willing
to
concede
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
that
it
had
jurisdiction.
had
there
been
a
subpoena
and
the
motion
was
made
to
vacate
the
subpoena
versus
the
motion
perhaps
should've
been
denied.
the
committee
had
a
right
to
hold
this
hearing
and
to
call
these
witnesses,
i
will
stipulate
to
all
of
that.
but
here
we
have
a
criminal
statute.
and
a
man
cannot
be
held
criminally
liable
on
the
basis
of
a
statute
which
combines
the
fairly
clear
language
of
section
192
with
the
most
obscure
and
meaningless
language
of
rule
11,
language
on
which
as
i
say,
many,
many
people
have
difficulty.
if
there
ever
was
a
case
of
blurred
signposts
to
criminality
concerning
which
the
court
spoke
in
united
states
against
the
cio,
this
is
it.
it
would
be
bad
enough
if
rumely
were
the
only
gloss
that
had
been
placed
on
section
192.
but
this
court
has
placed
still
another
gloss
on
it.
and
in
the
barenblatt
case,
the
court
found
that
these
questions
could
be
asked
depending
on
the
way
a
balance
felt.
and
when
this
is
added
to
section
192,
it
seems
to
me
that
to
require
a
person
to
guess
as
to
whether
he
is
supposed
to
answer,
whether
he
is
required
to
answer
a
question
or
not,
is
far
beyond
reason.
and
that
brings
me
to
balancing.
there
has
been
so
much
written
and
discussed
about
the
balancing
doctrine
as
set
forth
in
the
barenblatt
case
that
i
hesitate
somewhat
to
take
up
the
time
of
the
court
to
discuss
this
matter
in
detail
again.
not
only
have
there
been
a
majority
and
minority
opinions
of
this
court
on
a
--
in
a
number
of
important
cases,
but
there
have
been
law
review
articles
written
on
it
and
books
written
on
it,
and
the
subject
is
really
been
discussed
most
extensively.
nevertheless,
it
is
an
issue
in
the
case
and
a
very
important
issue.petitioner
contends
that
the
balancing
theory
is
unworkable.
but
it
is
as
of
today
the
rule
of
this
court,
and
therefore,
we
must
try
to
live
with
it
and
we
tried.
i
would
like
to
read
although
perhaps
the
recollections
of
the
court
doesn't
need
refreshing,
i'd
like
to
read
the
balancing
doctrine
as
set
forth
in
the
barenblatt
case,
a
single
sentence.
“where
first
amendment
rights
are
asserted
to
bar
governmental
interrogation,
the
resolution
of
the
issue
always
involves
a
balancing
by
the
courts
of
the
competing
private
and
public
interests
at
stake
in
the
particular
circumstances
shown”.
now,
this
presents
two
very
difficult
and
serious
problems.
the
first
might
be
called
a
substantive
problem.
what
do
we
weigh?
how
do
we
ascribe?
how
much
weight
is
to
be
placed
to
the
various
elements
that
we've
put
in
this
balance?
the
second
might
be
described
as
a
procedural
problem.
how
do
we
as
practicing
lawyers
trying
one
of
these
cases
go
about
the
task
of
convincing
the
court
at
the
trial
level?
how
this
balance
is
to
be
struck?
do
we
present
evidence
to
the
court
on
this
matter?
do
we
say
to
the
court
the
balance
should
be
struck
one
way
or
another
on
the
basis
of
certain
facts?
i
would
assume
from
the
language
of
the
court
that
the
question
of
whether
x
weighs
more
than
y
is
a
question
of
fact,
and
like
all
other
questions
of
fact
is
to
be
tried
by
the
court.
taking
the
procedural
matter
first,
we
attempted
to
meet
this
at
the
trial
level.
and
after
i
assure
you
a
great
deal
of
deliberation,
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
we
would
try
to
convince
the
court
that
in
the
particular
circumstances
in
this
case,
whatever
may
have
been
true
in
barenblatt
and
those
preceding
cases,
the
balance
fell
all
the
way.
and
we
call
an
expert
witness,
professor
thomas
emerson
of
yale
university,
the
record
contains
his
qualifications
on
the
subject
and
we
asked
him
a
series
of
questions
which
went
to
the
problem
of
how
much
weight
do
we
give
to
the
various
elements
in
this
scale?
how
many
investigations
has
the
committee
had
into
subversive
activities?
how
many
has
it
had
into
infiltration
in
the
steel
industry?
how
much
of
this
evidence
was
known
to
the
committee?
what
is
the
extent
of
the
communist
menace
in
the
united
states?
how
important
is
the
communist
party
as
a
threat
to
the
security
of
the
united
states?
what
kind
of
laws
do
we
already
have
on
our
books
with
respect
to
this
matter,
all
of
this
being
directed
to
the
question
of
where
the
balance
lies.
now,
the
government
says
that
his
testimony
which
of
course
was
presented
as
expert
testimony
was
contrary
to
a
lot
of
decisions
of
this
court,
aca
against
douds,
the
dennis
case,
subversive
activities
control
board
case,
carlson
against
landon
and
to
the
findings
of
congress
and
the
subversive
activities
control
act
for
example.
and
it's
true
of
course
that
professor
emerson's
testimony
was
contrary
to
it
but
what
of
it?
i
would
think
that
in
a
criminal
trial
if
a
defendant
wants
to
prove
--
that
today
is
friday,
he
has
a
right
to
come
in
and
try
to
prove
it.
that
may
be
hard
to
prove
but
he
has
a
right
to
try.
the
court
rejected
the
testimony.
the
district
court
as
i
recall
gave
no
reason
for
rejecting
the
testimony.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
said
that
the
testimony
is
rejected
because
the
question
of
balancing
is
a
matter
of
law
and
not
a
matter
of
fact.
and
i
must
confess
that
at
that
point
i
have
some
difficulty
in
following
the
reasoning
because
assuming
that
the
determination
of
which
outweighs
what
is
a
matter
for
the
court
to
decide.
how
was
the
court
going
to
tell,
what
are
the
facts
on
the
basis
of
which
this
question
of
law
is
going
to
be
determined?
does
the
court
reach
its
conclusions
with
respect
to
the
importance
of
the
steel
industry
with
respect
to
the
importance
of
the
communist
party
with
respect
to
all
of
these
other
things,
by
reading
the
newspapers
or
by
reading
acts
of
congress,
or
by
listening
to
the
television?
i
should
assume
normally
that
one
of
the
ways
in
which
a
court
makes
up
his
mind
how
to
decide
even
a
question
of
law
is
by
the
presentation
of
testimony.
we
think
we
had
a
right
to
introduce
that
testimony.
we
think
it
was
highly
relevant
on
the
question
of
balance.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
first
problem
which
i
have
characterized
as
the
substantive
problem
and
it
is
here
that
i
have
the
greatest
difficulty
and
if
what
i
say
sounds
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
there
is
an
offer
of
proof
in
the
record.
the
testimony
is
set
forth
in
full
in
the
record
and
it
is
before
your
honors.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
if
you're
going
to
make
the
balance
and
you
are
prepared
to
accept
his
testimony,
i
suppose
it
could
be
thrown
into
the
balance.
of
course,
there
was
no
cross-examinations
since
it
was
merely
in
the
form
of
an
offer
of
proof.
there
was
no
countervailing
testimony.
that
is,
the
government
made
no
effort
to
meet
the
testimony
but
its
here
for
the
court
to
examine.
i
should
like
to
discuss
the
problem
of
what
gets
in
this
balance
and
if
i
sound
in
this
discussion
more
like
a
metaphysician
than
a
lawyer,
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
wasn't
my
idea
of
this
balancing
theory.
the
solicitor
general
says
--
or
let
me
put
it
this
way,
there
are
two
sides
to
this
balance.
there's
the
side
for
affirmance
and
there's
the
side
for
reversal.
the
side
for
affirmance
which
is
the
solicitor
general's
side,
says
that
the
public
interest
that
is
involved
in
this
situation
and
i
quote
from
page
48
of
the
brief
is,
the
need
for
information
concerning
putative
subversive
activities
in
a
critical
area
of
our
national
life.
now,
remember
in
discussing
this,
i
am
not
discussing
admissibility
of
testimony
or
pertency
--
pertinency
of
testimony.
i
am
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
how
much
weight
shall
be
given
to
it
in
this
constitutional
balance?
how
important
is
it
to
outweigh
the
very
weighty
considerations
which
everybody
concedes
at
least
in
the
language,
everybody
concedes
lie
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance.
how
much
importance
is
it
that
the
government
have
this
--
the
answers
to
these
questions?as
i
said
before,
this
was
the
tenth
inquiry
into
the
question
of
communist
infiltration
into
basic
industry.
thousands
--
literally,
thousands
of
pages
of
testimony
had
been
taken
on
this
subject
before
the
gary
hearing
and
hundreds
of
witnesses
had
been
called.
it
is
conceded
by
counsel
that
much
of
the
testimony
sought
of
mr.
yellin
was
corroborated
of
information
that
was
already
in
its
files.
as
a
matter
of
fact
says
the
government,
it
had
most
of
this
information,
its
far
back
as
1947.
look
at
the
debates
when
the
taft-hartley
law,
section
9
(h)
was
passed.
and
i
might
refer
also
to
mr.
justice
jackson's
opinion
in
aca
against
douds.
now,
the
government
responds
to
all
of
this
by
saying
that
the
--
it
isn't
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
congress
needs
more
information.
it
isn't
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
congress
wants
corroboration.
and
i
would
say
that
would
be
true
if
we
were
talking
about
questions
of
admissibility
because
i
suppose
counsel
in
a
case
have
the
right
to
get
evidence
which
corroborates
information
in
its
files
if
he
wants
to.
but
it
is
for
the
court
to
decide
how
much
weight
is
to
be
given
in
the
balance,
otherwise,
how
can
we
possibly
apply
the
test
in
the
barenblatt
case.
how
many
times
are
we
to
listen
to
a
repetition
of
the
same
testimony
sometimes
from
the
same
witnesses
repeating
over
and
over
and
over
again
the
same
the
facts
with
respect
to
alleged
communist
infiltration
in
the
steel
industry
or
in
other
basic
industry
before
we
get
to
the
point
where
we
say
this
weighs
as
only
a
grain
of
sand
in
the
balance.
it's
not
admissibility,
it's
not
pertinency
but
weight
in
the
balance.
is
there
not
a
time
when
this
must
end
and
we
will
say
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
witness
will
overcome?
mr.
tavenner
in
his
testimony
in
this
case
said
at
one
point
and
i
quote,
its
in
the
footnote
of
page
19
of
my
brief,
he
said,
“we
received
a
considerable
amount
of
evidence
at
flint,
michigan
or
perhaps
eight
or
10
instances
of
colonization
of
the
exact
type
that
you
describe”.
how
long
do
we
continue
to
deprive
persons
of
the
way
he
writes
which
everybody
admits
that
they
have
in
order
to
get
this
additional
bit,
this
additional
one
man
who
will
testify
to
something
after
thousands
of
pages
of
testimony
have
taken
and
hundreds
of
witnesses
have
testified
on
this
subject?
that's
on
the
one
side
of
the
scale.
what
have
we
got
on
the
other
side?
the
first
place
we
have
the
petitioner's
right.
the
right
to
engage
in
public
debate
on
critical
issues,
a
right
which
the
court
has
on
frequent
occasions
held
there's
tremendous
importance
and
the
right
which
the
activities
of
this
committee
inhibits
for
reasons
that
are
set
forth
fully
in
the
watkins
and
sweezy
cases.
but,
there
is
another
right,
a
right
which
a
very
great
justice
of
this
court
felt
was
perhaps
the
most
important
right
of
all.
mr.
justice
brandeis
said,
the
makers
of
our
constitution
recognized
the
significance
of
man's
spiritual
nature
of
his
feelings
and
of
his
intellect.
they
knew
that
only
a
part
of
the
plain
pleasure
and
satisfactions
of
life
are
to
be
found
in
material
things.
they
sought
to
protect
americans
in
their
beliefs,
their
thoughts,
their
emotions
and
their
sensations.
and
they
conferred
as
against
the
government
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
the
most
comprehensive
of
rights
and
the
right
most
valued
by
civilized
men.
this
is
the
right
which
lies
or
one
of
the
rights
which
lies
on
one
side
of
the
balance.
but
there
is
another
element
in
this
balance
on
petitioner's
side
which
i
think
is
even
weightier
and
that
is
the
right
of
the
public
to
hear.
in
de
jonge,
this
court
said
the
security
--
the
security
of
the
republic,
the
very
foundation
of
constitutional
government
lies
in
full
opportunity
for
free
political
discussions.
edward
yellin
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case
but
ranged
along
with
him
as
co-petitioners
unknowing,
sometimes
perhaps
even
unwillingly,
there
is
a
host
of
other
persons.
there
is
the
committee
for
sane
nuclear
policy
which
was
investigated
by
the
committee
and
was
almost
destroyed,
if
not
completely
destroyed,
by
the
committee.
next
week
in
this
city,
there
will
be
hearings
at
which
some
20
witnesses
of
women
strike
for
peace
will
be
called
before
this
committee.
last
week,
an
organization
called
medical
aid
for
cuba,
two
weeks
ago
perhaps,
was
the
subject
of
an
investigation
by
this
committee.
the
world
fellowship
camp
was
the
subject
of
an
investigation
not
by
this
committee
but
by
a
little
committee
of
little
--
un-american
activities
committee
up
in
new
hampshire.
the
integration
movement,
almost
every
progressive
movement
in
the
united
states
has
at
one
time
or
another
been
subject
to
the
investigation
by
this
committee.
to
my
mind,
this
is
the
weightiest
element
of
all.
now,
the
government
responds
by
saying
mr.
yellin
wasn't
trying
to
debate,
he
wanted
to
keep
quiet.
he
had
an
opportunity
to
express
his
views
freely
at
this
committee
and
they
would've
given
him
plenty
of
opportunity
to
do
so
perhaps
and
perhaps
they
would
have,
i
don't
know.
but
certainly
the
right
to
engage
in
free
political
discussion
involves
the
right
to
choose
your
own
forum.
no
one
who
was
present
at
the
gary
hearing
could
possibly
have
confused
that
hearing
room
with
the
free
marketplace
of
ideas
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
guarantee
provided
by
the
constitution.
mr.
yellin,
if
he
wanted
to
express
his
views,
had
a
right
to
express
his
views
in
the
circumstances
and
in
conditions
that
he
chose,
not
in
conditions
in
which
he
was
appearing
as
a
witness
before
a
committee
in
a
courtroom
crowded
with
hostile
persons,
with
the
opportunity
for
an
exchange
of
ideas
which
the
constitution
is
supposed
to
guarantee
was
not
present.
now,
i'm
aware
as
i
speak
that
really
in
talking
about
this
balance,
i
am
attempting
to
weigh
the
imponderable,
to
measure
the
limitless.
in
a
sense,
that's
perhaps
the
principal
reason
why
i
feel
that
the
barenblatt
balancing
test
is
improper.
it
cannot
be
applied.
it
would
turn
the
law
into
a
scholastic's
debate
rather
than
a
living
technique
or
a
living
method
for
ruling
man
and
in
this
case,
for
protecting
the
fundamental
freedoms
without
which,
we
have
no
democracy
here.
and
there
are
other
reasons
which
have
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
why
the
balancing
theory
is
not
consistent
with
the
constitution.
as
mr.
justice
black
has
so
frequently
pointed
out,
the
language
of
the
constitution
is
absolute.
furthermore,
the
doctrine
is
based
on
the
fullest
premise.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
i
followed
the
literal
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
the
literal
language
that
i
am
relying
on
is
that
congress
having
no
power
to
invest
--
to
pass
a
law
restricting
propaganda
activities
likewise
congress
has
no
power
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
that
area
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
think
it's
not
the
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
submit
that
furthermore
the
barenblatt
decision,
braden,
and
wilkinson
decisions
provide
--
proceed
on
a
false
premise
namely
that
our
national
security
can
be
injured
by
too
much
free
speech,
by
too
much
political
organization,
by
too
much
free
association.
i
don't
know
of
any
society,
certainly
no
well-established
society
whose
security
was
ever
threatened
by
too
much
free
speech.
it
may
be
true
of
a
country
that
is
just
emerging
from
colonialism
where
for
a
period
of
time,
limitations
on
free
speech
are
necessary,
but
we're
a
strong
country,
probably
the
strongest
in
the
world.
our
political
institutions
are
stable
and
the
greatest
threat
to
that
stability
is
i
suggest
an
interference
with
the
freedom
of
speech.
i
would
like
to
return
now
to
the
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
stewart
at
the
very
beginning
namely
the
remarks
at
page
26
of
the
government's
brief,
namely
the
delicate
and
dangerous
of
the
--
the
most
delicate
and
dangerous
of
a
courts'
responsibilities
with
which
justifies
a
constant
review
of
the
constitutional
issues
that
are
involved
in
these
cases.
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
this
--
the
issue
raised
by
this
controversy
relates
somehow
to
the
balance
of
--
to
the
balance
of
powers
between
the
court
and
congress.
and
that
the
real
issue
in
this
case,
the
most
important
problem
in
this
case
is
the
manner
in
which
the
congress,
an
equal
and
coordinate
branch
of
government,
has
performed
one
of
its
own
constitutional
functions.
and
it
goes
on
to
refer
to
the
dangers
of
collision
between
this
court
and
the
congress.
now,
i
admit
that
that
is
a
dangerous
and
a
difficult
controversy
and
a
delicate
one
also.
and
i
don't
think
that
it
is
in
this
case
too
in
a
very
great
extent.
i
should
have
thought
that
the
fundamental
problem
with
respect
to
the
extent
to
which
this
court
may
interfere
with
if
i
may
use
that
word
or
review
the
actions
of
congress
had
been
set
on
the
marbury
against
madison.
and
while
i
know
the
question
keeps
recurring
every
once
and
a
while,
i
really
think
it's
a
pretty
unimportant
part
of
this
case.
there
is,
however,
a
delicate
and
a
dangerous
issue
before
this
court.
and
that
relates
not
to
the
relationship
between
this
court
and
congress
but
rather
to
the
much
more
important,
much
more
critical
relationship
between
the
citizen
and
this
government,
the
extent
to
which
the
government
may
interfere
with
the
freedom
of
speech
and
the
freedom
of
association
of
the
individual.
this
is
the
first
amendment.
this
is
the
issue
which
has
been
--
which
has
come
before
this
court
scores
of
time,
particularly
in
the
last
17
years,
i
guess
it
is
since
the
cold
war
began.
and
although
i
don't
want
to
discourage
any
of
the
members
of
the
court,
my
guess
is,
it's
going
to
continue
to
come
before
this
court
because
it
is
a
difficult
and
a
dangerous
and
a
delicate
problem.
it's
the
issue
which
i
think
begun
in
aca
against
douds
and
then
to
the
dennis
case,
and
the
yates
case,
and
the
ballin
and
the
lerner
case,
and
the
uphaus,
and
watkins,
and
sweezy
and
barenblatt
and
all
of
these
other
cases.
it
had
to
be
faced
in
those
cases
and
i
think
it
has
to
be
faced
again
and
it
will
continue
to
come
before
this
court
as
long
as
there
is
a
court
because
the
problems
which
arise
out
of
the
efforts
of
a
government
to
interfere
with
the
freedom
of
its
citizens
are
never
ending.
the
effect
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
well-known.
it
has
resulted
in
--
well,
one
of
the
members
of
this
court
has
referred
to
in
two
articles
written
i
believe
10
or
12
years
apart
as
the
black
silence
of
fear
or
more
recently
the
submerged
american.
i
think
this
committee
has
played
a
tremendous
role
in
creating
that
black
silence
of
fear.
and
while
it
is
not
the
only
one
of
our
government
agencies
which
has
resulted
in
submerging
the
american
and
cutting
off
so
much
of
the
vital
debate
which
is
necessary
if
our
country
is
to
survive
as
a
free
country.
it
has
played
its
role
in
that.
i
hope
that
the
court
will
take
this
opportunity
to
reconsider
the
decisions
that
i
have
referred
to
and
to
free
our
people
and
our
democracy
from
at
least
one
of
those
repressive
forces
which
has
interfered
for
i
guess
about
25
years
now
with
the
free
and
full
expression
of
opinion
by
americans
and
their
free
association.
thank
you.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
thank
you
sir.
i
trust
i
need
not
remind
the
court
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
application
of
a
criminal
statute
and
the
right
i
take
it
that
every
person
accused
of
a
criminal
statute
has
to
present
whatever
facts
there
are
in
its
favor.
and
to
have
the
determination
made
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that's
presented
in
the
court
and
not
determine
on
whether
this
court
or
any
other
court
who
has
read
newspapers
or
what
newspaper
they
have
read.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
any
intelligent
system
of
justice
can
be
operated
on
that
basis
and
we
never
have
up
to
this
point.
i
am
somewhat
entranced
by
the
suggestions,
somewhat
belatedly
made
that
the
government
is
now
prepared
to
stipulate
professor
emerson's
testimony,
because
this
professor
emerson's
testimony
is
admitted
as
i
understand
the
situation,
this
judgment
of
conviction
should
be
set
aside
as
contrary
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
since
there's
no
evidence
at
all
on
the
other
side.
no
one
--
nobody
put
any
evidence
here
about
the
extent
of
communism
in
the
united
states,
about
how
vital
or
not
vital
the
steel
industry
was,
or
any
of
these
other
facts,
and
i
would
take
it
that
where
there
is
some
evidence
on
one
side
and
no
evidence
on
the
other,
the
court
would
have
to
rule
on
the
basis
of
that
record.
of
course
this
was
not
the
position
of
the
court
below
and
i
am
sure
of
the
--
and
not
the
position
of
the
government
below
and
i
am
sure
that
had
the
matter
been
--
had
the
evidence
been
admitted,
there
would've
been
cross-examination
and
i
should
think
that
there
would
have
been
not
only
cross-examination
but
perhaps
rebuttal
testimony
because
professor
emerson's
testimony,
it
seems
to
me,
goes
directly
to
this
whole
process
of
balancing.
and
while
it
may
not
have
been
as
effective
as
calling
a
hundred
thousand
or
a
hundred
and
eighty
million
witnesses
and
asking
them
whether
they're
members
of
the
communist
party,
somewhat
impractical,
it
seems
to
me
the
kind
of
occasion
which
opinion
testimony
is
appropriate.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
in
the
first
place,
i
never
said
that
congress
couldn't
investigate.
congress
can
investigate
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i've
--
i've
never
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
have
never
even
suggested
that
congress
cannot
conduct
an
investigation
by
interrogating
witnesses
because
there
are
many
witnesses,
hundreds
of
them,
perhaps
thousands,
who
have
come
in
and
who
have
testified
quite
freely
on
this
subject.
and
while
i
think
that
the
committee
is
acting
beyond
its
jurisdiction
and
so
forth
for
the
reasons
that
i've
stated
before,
i
don't
know
of
any
way
of
stopping
a
committee
from
calling
a
witness
who
testifies
voluntarily
before
him
about
his
or
her
membership
in
the
communist
party
as
was
of
course
true
in
this
very
hearing
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
where
several
witnesses
did
testify.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
that
if
i
had
to,
i
would
be
willing
to
go
that
far.
but
i
don't
have
to.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
because
in
this
case
and
if
there
was
one
thing
i
learned
from
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
that
is
that
i
shouldn't
try
to
prove
more
than
i
have
to,
to
win
my
case.
in
this
case,
in
view
of
the
extensive
testimony
that
congress
have
taken
on
this
particular
subject
and
in
view
of
the
trivial
nature
of
the
questions
that
were
asked,
then
i'll
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
was
cumulative
testimony
and
it
was
corroborated
in
the
view
of
the
view
of
a
very
large
elements
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance,
i
say
that
congress
did
not
have
the
right
to
conduct
this
--
to
ask
these
questions
of
mr.
yellin.
and
i
think
that
same
thing
is
probably
true
of
the
whole
gary
investigation.
they
had
volunteer
witnesses
there
who
gave
a
great
deal
of
information
about
this
so-called
colonization
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
just
a
moment.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh,
no.
no
suggestion
whatsoever.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
suppose
so.
i'm
not
sure
that
there
was
any
bill
that
was
really
referred
to
--
the
committee
always
talks
in
terms
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act
than
the
other
bills
that
may
be
passed,
that
congressman
walter
for
years
has
been
introducing,
and
onto
this
bill
which
covers
a
wide
variety
of
subjects
and
its
on
this
bills
that
they
committee
sometimes
says
that
it's
holding
its
hearing.
i
would
just
like
to
raise
one
or
two
rather
short
points.
one
goes
to
this
executive
session
matter.
it
is
true
that
at
rule
--
at
page
82
of
the
record,
mr.
walter
set
forth,
i
think
in
pretty
complete
form,
the
general
rules
that
the
committee
uses
in
determining
whether
as
to
here,
to
hold
executive
sessions,
and
i
think
that
that
is
conclusive
in
my
favor
because
the
general
rules
and
he
says,
there
are
very
many
exceptions
or
any
exceptions
he
said
is
in
may
favor
but
even
more
telling
if
i
may
suggest,
it
is
the
testimony
at
rule
70
because
as
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out,
the
rule
said
congressman
walter,
the
rule
with
respect
to
an
executive
session
was
not
applicable
but
sentence
didn't
stop
there
although
that's
where
the
solicitor
general
stopped
reading
it.
the
next
word
is
“because”
and
then
congressman
walter
goes
on
to
apply
a
completely
different
standard,
different
from
the
standard
you
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it's
on
page
70,
sir.
and
it's
the
first
question
--
the
first
answer
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
“the
rule
with
respect
to
an
executive
session
was
not
applicable
because
the
investigator
was
an
fbi
agent
and
he'd
done
a
pretty
good
investigating
job”,
which
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
rule
iv-a.
mr.
solicitor
general
suggested
that
this
was
not
a
case
of
exposure
for
the
sake
of
exposure.
well
frankly,
if
this
was
not
--
if
this
is
--
if
the
failure
to
call
an
executive
session
under
these
circumstances
was
not
a
perfect
case
of
calling
witness
in
public
for
no
reason
other
than
to
give
publicity
to
his
testimony,
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
i
would
like
to
go
to
one
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
pardon
me?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
--
i've
argued
it
in
the
brief.
i
think
the
failure
--
i
don't
remember
exactly
what
page,
but
it
certainly
is
in
there.
i
would
like
to
go
to
this
question
as
to
whether
this
testimony
as
corroborated
or
accumulated
or
what
have
you.
questions
one
and
three
were
admittedly
corroborative
of
testimony
that
the
committee
had
in
its
files.
and
mr.
tavenner
said
so
on
the
stand.
he
said,
“yes,
we
had
sworn
witnesses
who
testified
that
this
man
lived
in
gary.
we
have
subpoenaed
his
employment
records”.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
his
employment
records
i
think
were
put
in
the
record
and
we
have
sworn
testimony
that
he
was
a
member
of
a
communist
party
in
1949.
and
we
knew
all
of
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that's
true.
they
didn't
know
whether
he
still
was,
but
they
didn't
ask
him
whether
he
still
was.
that's
not
one
of
the
counts
in
this
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
it
is
probably
--
well,
this
is
true
of
all
accumulated
testimony
or
corroborated
testimony,
sir.
and
i
--
and
i
said,
i'm
not
arguing
that
it
wasn't
relevant.
i
am
merely
arguing
that
it
weighs
very
little
in
the
balance.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
pardon
me?
oh,
i
don't
know.
he
said
they
had
sworn
testimony.
one
of
whom
testified
at
the
gary
hearing
but
i
don't
know
how
many.
now,
on
the
other
question
namely
the
extent
of
colonization
in
gary,
at
page
151
of
the
record,
there
appears
the
report
of
the
house
committee.
and
i'm
not
going
to
read
it.
it
runs
on
some
--
well,
its
too
closely
printed
pages.
i'll
just
read
a
few
words.
“describing
the
tactical
maneuvers
of
the
communist
party
in
its
infiltration
of
labor
unions,
mr.
lautner
asserted
that
colonizers
were
sent
to
gary,
indiana
for
the
purpose
of
building
a
party
in
the
steel
industry.
he
defined
a
colonized
communist
as”
--
and
then
he
goes
on
to
describe
one.
“the
witness
told
the
committee
of
classes
conducted
by
j.
peters,
a
national
functionary
for
the
communist
party
for
colonizing
members
of
the
communist
party.”
and
he
goes
on
at
very
considerable
length
discussing
the
whole
colonization
program
of
the
communist
party
in
gary
and
elsewhere.
mr.
lautner
testified
immediately
before
mr.
yellin.
the
committee
goes
on
to
discuss
the
testimony
of
mr.
lafleur
who
also
testified
as
to
the
colonization
in
the
communist
party
and
it
ends
up
with
this
conclusion
reached
without
the
benefit
of
mr.
yellin's
testimony.
“the
testimony
disclosed
the
pattern
of
colonization
in
the
steel
industry
by
young
men
with
excellent
training
and
education
who
came
into
the
area
from
new
york
city
and
elsewhere.
it
is
apparent
that
a
hard
core
of
communist
party
--
of
the
communist
party
is
actively
engaged
in
the
rehabilitation
of
a
communist
party
in
the
steel
industry
in
gary”.
so
i
submit
the
question
two
and
four
were
just
as
cumulative
as
the
others
and
weigh
just
as
little
in
the
balance,
if
we
are
to
balance.
