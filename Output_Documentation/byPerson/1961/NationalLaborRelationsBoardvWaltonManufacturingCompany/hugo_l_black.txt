justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
please?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
--
do
these
two
records
contain
all
of
the
evidence
before
the
labor
board
or
simply
selected
parts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
you
that
question
because
the
--
as
i
understand
that
the
act
of
congress
was
intending
to
require
the
judge
that
decided
on
this
frequency
of
this
evidence
to
review
the
whole
record
rather
than
part
that
we
have
previously
been
doing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
called
to
the
attention
of
defense
you
yield,
just
a
part
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
your
time
is
up
but
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
mentioned
to
you
that,
which
troubles
me
about
both
of
your
cases,
i,
under
the
old
rule,
i
wrote
many
of
the
opinions
in
which
we
picked
out
part
of
the
evidence,
picked
out
another
file
and
this
shows
a
claim
conflict
which
was
the
duty
of
the
board
to
decide.
now,
they
claim
there,
congress
claim
they
wanted
to
get
away
from
there
as
wi
--
within
its
power
to
do
it,
as
i
understand.
and
it
then
said
that
after,
you
must
not
do
that.
you
must
look
at
the
entire
record.
what
bothers
me
is
how
is
it
possible
to
say
that
this
court
must
look
at
the
entire
records
not
leaving
a
great
leeway
to
use
its
own
judgment
whether
or
not
some
told
the
--
the
conclusion
should
be
reached
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
merit.
if
that
is
not
the
case
then
we
are
required,
are
we
not,
to
read
all
of
the
evidence
when
cases
come
before
us,
a
test
which
would
not
very
high
and
many
cases
came
in
order
for
us
to
reach
a
conclusion
not
merely
as
just
one
witness
testified
just
another
testifies
did
but
we
impressed
like
a
jury
with
the
or
judge
on
the
trier
of
fact
one
side
is
right
and
one
side
is
wrong.
why
--
why
does
that
not
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
leave
the
courts
of
appeal
with
practical
--
fina
--
as
to
practical
power
finalities
on
using
that
judgment
and
substituted
their
judgment,
if
you
please,
put
out
as
the
board.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
seen
any
in
either
the
cases
here.
i
may
say
that
under
the
old
rule,
i
would
have
no
trouble
with
your
cases
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
none.
but
i've
seen
no
indication
in
here
has
been
decided
on
such
a
legal
le
--
rigid
legal
principle.
as
you
say,
i
can
see
where
the
result
of
what
the
congress
has
done
is
liable
to
give
different
kind
of
judgment
in
ten
different
circuits.
if
that
has
to
be
faced,
it
will
not
be
as
uniform
action
as
you
have
when
you
have
one
censor
board
finally
to
make
the
judgment.
but
just
as
congress
--
is
that
what
they've
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
should
do
it?
should
we
re
--
should
we
reverse
that
without
reading
every
word
of
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
would
require,
would
it
not,
in
good
conscience
that
we
read
them
all
evidence?
how
could
we
do
it
otherwise?
that's
what
congress
has
said.
we
could
say
maybe
you're
not
--
we
couldn't
argue
that
congress
didn't
have
the
power
suppose
you're
not
arguing
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
said
that
and
how
can
we
do
it
without
reading
every
word
of
the
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
a
--
is
it
a
non-reasonable
assumption
as
what
congress
intended
to
do
here
was
really
to
make
the
court
of
appeals?
the
judge
of
the
--
use
its
best
judgment
in
deciding
which
way,
what
should
be
done
in
--
in
affecting
these
laws
so
long
as
--
it
might
be
--
you
could
say,
“well,
there's
just
no
earthly
reason.
you
can
read
the
evidence.”
no
possibility
of
reaching
this
conclusion.
but
if
there's
a
possibility,
can
we
do
anything
and
can
we
do
anything
anyhow
without
reading
all
the
record
of
the
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
evaluation
of
evidence
by
evaluators
as
very
hard
enough
legal
principles
under
which
it
do
it.
i
know
about
a
lot
of
the
rules
that
this
deems
and
from
this
you
can
presume
with,
but
in
the
final
analysis,
that's
the
exercise
of
judgment
if
--
like
a
jury
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
volume?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
volume
ii?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
statement?
i
don't
see
much
relevant
to.
i'd
like
to
see.
justice
hugo
l.
black
read
the
whole
brief.
