mr.
robert
t.
thompson
it's
indeed
a
privilege
for
me
to
stand
before
this
court
and
defend
the
good
name
of
the
fifth
circuit
because
i
think
that's
exactly
the
issue
which
has
been
raised
by
the
board
in
this
case.
and
i
--
i
say
that
with
these
factors
in
mind.
they
not
only
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
misapplied
the
law,
but
they
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
very
case
has
misapplied
by
the
law
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
very
case
has
stated
precisely
what
they
say
the
law
is.
now,
the
only
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn
from
an
argument
along
that
line
is
that
the
court
is
saying
it's
doing
one
thing
but
it's
actually
doing
another.
there
is
suggestion
of
bad
faith.
i
will
not
go
into
that
but
it's
certainly
is
the
position
of
the
board
that
the
court
is
talking
one
game
and
playing
another.
now,
as
i
understand,
the
board's
argument
on
the
law
in
this
case,
they
are
stating
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
rejected
the
board's
choice
of
unreasonable
or
reasonably
conflicting
inferences
which
they
contend
that
this
court
has
said
the
fifth
circuit
or
any
circuit
cannot
do.
in
the
decision
itself,
the
court
took
cognizance
of
the
decisions,
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
stating
that
it
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
did
not
have
the
right
to
displace
the
inferences
which
have
been
drawn
by
the
board
where
they
are
fairly
conflict
--
conflicting
and
reasonably
drawn.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
find
and
state
that
from
a
tedious
examination
of
this
record,
it
had
come
to
the
firm
conviction
that
the
board's
opinion
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
as
they
hold.
secondly,
as
i
understand
the
board's
contention,
they
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
requires
a
higher
degree
of
proof
in
--
in
discharge
cases
such
as
this
as
opposed
to
routine
cease-and-desist
order
cases
such
as
8
(a)
(1)
matters,
citing
in
support
of
that,
tex-o-kan
--
the
tex-o-kan
case
which
was
decided
some
20
years
ago
and
as
far
as
i've
been
able
to
determine
was
not
questioned
by
the
board
at
that
time,
certainly
was
not
reviewed
by
this
court.
i
respectfully
submit
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
tex-o-kan
case
does
not
support
the
contention
which
is
here
made
by
the
board.
in
the
tex-o-kan
case,
if
you
read
the
precise
language
and
judge
--
judge
sibley
was
one
of
our
great
jurors
from
my
state.
he
said
that
in
a
cease-and-desist
case,
we
require
less
than
a
demonstration.
those
are
his
words
because
the
remedy
which
is
proposed
imposes
no
great
burden
on
the
employer.
but
in
a
discharge
case
where
there
is
a
remedy
of
back
pay,
reinstatement
and
so
forth,
the
burden
is
upon
the
employer
and
it
could
possibly
impoverish
him
or
break
him
to
use
his
words.
and
in
those
cases
and
here
again,
these
are
his
exact
words,
“we
will
require
substantial
evidence.”
now,
the
national
labor
relations
act
at
that
time
did
not
read
as
it
does
now
on
this
scope
of
review
question.
perhaps,
the
tex-o-kan
case
was
subject
to
question
in
1940
or
1941
when
it
was
decided.
but
in
1947,
congress
enacted
the
taft-hartley
act
and
inserted
into
the
law
governing
this
scope
of
review
the
requirement
that
the
board's
findings
of
fact
be
supported
by
the
--
by
substantial
evidence
upon
consideration
of
the
record
as
they
hold.
now,
what
judge
sibley
said
was
exactly
what
the
statute
now
requires
and
his
further
statement
concerning
the
board's
treatment
of
a
respondent's
or
an
employer's
testimony
likewise
is
a
proper
statement
of
the
law.
before
i
left
home,
i
glanced
that
shepherd
cited
on
this
tex-o-kan
case
and
it
must
have
been
cited
50
or
60
times
since
1940.
so
far
as
i
know,
it's
never
been
questioned
until
now.
if
you
read
the
language
concerning
which
the
board
complains
and
which
he
cited
in
the
--
in
the
opinion
in
this
very
case,
either
the
board
has
misread
the
language
or
i
misread
the
language.
judge
sibley
said
that
when
an
employer
testifies
that
union
membership
was
not
the
reason
for
the
discharge.
his
oath
cannot
be
disregarded
because
of
suspicion
that
he
may
be
lying.
well
now,
there
are
dozens
and
dozens
of
cases
from
all
over
the
circuits
which
hold
and
the
statute
itself
says
in
requiring
substantial
evidence
that
the
board
cannot
decide
these
cases
on
suspicion
and
surmise
but
that
the
board
must
have
substantial
evidence,
evidence
which
it
may
credit
and
rely
upon.
true,
the
board
may
draw
--
draw
inferences.
we
do
not
condemn
that
the
consolidated
copper
case,
nevada
consolidated
copper
case
is
completely
out
of
date
in
that
regard.
we
concede
that
the
board
as
in
effect
finds
to
must
have
the
right
to
draw
inferences.
but
those
inferences
must
be
reasonable
and
they
must
be
supported
by
some
facts
in
the
record.
by
the
same
token,
simply
because
the
board
can
draw
an
inference,
that
does
not
enable
the
board
to
state
its
entire
case
on
an
inference
which
from
a
review
of
the
record
as
a
whole
does
not
hold
up
or
is
not
considered
substantial.
but
to
go
back
to
the
tex-o-kan
case,
judge
sibley
stated,
“there
must
be
impeachment
of
him
or
substantial
contradiction
or
if
circumstances
raised
doubts.
they
must
be
inconsistent
with
the
positive
sworn
testimony
on
the
exact
point.”
now,
what
he
was
saying
there
was,
not
that
the
board
has
got
to
have
positive
sworn
testimony
on
the
exact
thought
but
that
if
the
board
relies
upon
circumstances
which
raised
doubt,
they
must
be
inconsistent
with
the
positive
sworn
testimony
of
the
employer,
therein
lies
the
misconstruction
of
that
decision.
if
you
read
it
in
that
regard,
certainly
it
cannot
be
said
to
be
a
misconstruction
of
the
law.
certainly,
if
the
board
is
going
to
rely
upon
circumstances,
they
should
be
inconsistent
the
positive
testimony
of
the
employer
in
that
regard
and
should
not
be
some
completely
unrelated
set
of
circumstances
which
throw
no
light
upon
that.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
it
certainly
was
sir.
first,
the
finding
of
the
board
was
that
--
this
mrs.
yancey
was
discharged
because
of
union
activities.
the
basis
for
that
finding
as
i
read
the
record
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
the
examiner
reported
on
that
in
great
detail.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
the
examiner
reported
that
he
found
that
this
lady,
mrs.
yancey
had
joined
the
union
some
time
prior
to
her
being
discharged.
he
did
--
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
employer
had
knowledge
of
hers
having
sign
with
the
union.
the
examiner
found
that
she
has
signed
roughly
ten
days
before
her
discharge.
the
--
there
is
evidence
in
the
record.
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that
point.
the
court
was
of
the
impression.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
alright
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
she
was
--
she
was
discharged.
she
came
in
and
complained
about
being
discharged.
she
was
first
told,
the
examiner
found,
that
she
was
being
discharged
for
lack
of
work.
she
went
in
and
complained
to
the
manager
and
she
was
told
by
the
manager
that
she
was
being
discharged
because
her
work
was
not
satisfactory.
the
additional
element
which
the
board
found
and
i
--
i
sincerely
believe
is
the
reason
that
they
made
this
finding
was
that
the
following
day
and
in
this
regard,
i'm
sure
counsel
overlooked
this
fact.
but
in
this
regard,
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out.
the
following
day
after
she
was
discharged,
after
her
conversation
with
the
manager
in
which
he
told
she
was
discharge
for
unsatisfactory
work.
she
returned
to
the
plant
and
--
and
demanded
an
interview
with
the
same
manager
and
she
sat
down
with
him
and
she
testified
that
during
the
course
of
the
conversation,
she
stated
that
she
thought
she
was
being
discharge
for
union
activities
and
that
he
then
stated
to
her
that
he
understood
that
she
and
her
husband
had
been
doing
work
with
the
union
organizers,
now,
that's
--
as
i
read
the
record,
the
basis
for
the
board's
decision.
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
testimony
which
was
put
in
by
the
employer
can
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
that's
my
understanding
of,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
the
testimony
of
the
lady.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
well,
her
testimony
is
found
at
page
521
of
the
record.
let's
see.
also
at
--
actually,
i'm
looking
at
indexes.
also
at
page
331
of
the
record,
her
testimony
is
found.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
i
did
overlook
that,
not
intentionally.
i'll
show
you
a
further
part
of
that
conversation
on
the
second
day
after
she
was
discharged
was
her
statement
to
the
manager
that
my
job
means
more
to
me
than
this
union.
now,
our
contention
was
that
she
told
them
that
i'll
go
out
and
spy
for
you
on
the
union
and
report
back
to
you.
she
admitted
at
least
on
the
stand
that
she
told
them
she
would
be
against
the
union
if
he
would
give
her
job
back.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
yes
sir.
i
don't
question
that.
and
i
think
certainly,
these
are
important
matters
which
--
which
are
under
consideration.
i
don't
mean
to
make
light
of
any
of
these
things.
i
think
it's
also
an
important
matter
for
--
for
an
employer
to
--
to
have
the
problem
or
the
liability
which
is
--
which
is
contained
in
the
case
such
as
this.
certainly,
in
many
of
these
circuits,
i
think
you
find
the
employers
less
litigious
over
these
points
for
that
very
reason.
that
--
that
element,
i
--
i
concede
was
also
contained
in
the
conversation
and
it
was
an
oversight
on
my
part.
the
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
the
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
well,
that's
not
my
reading
of
the
record.
and
i
--
it's
possible
that
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
there
is
--
yes
sir,
there
is
--
there
is
that
conversation
in
her
testimony.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
i
can't
call
your
attention
to
--
at
this
--
this
very
moment.
i'm
informed
that
it's
at
page
332.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
yes
sir.
331
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
she
--
i
think
she
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
yes
sir.
i
think
you
find
that
the
reason
you
get
two
sections
of
testimony
is
that,
when
this
thing
was
printed,
they
printed
the
board's
specification
of
the
record
and
they
printed
out
specifications
separately
so
you
actually
have
to
go
one
of
those
in
order
to
get
the
entire
testimony.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
the
bottom
i
believe
sir.
and
his
testimony
on
page
332
is
this.
he
said
that
he
didn't
know
whether
i
signed
the
union
card
or
not.
i
told
him,
i
said,
“well,
morris,
my
job
means
more
than
being
a
member
of
the
union
if
you
would
give
it
back
--
give
my
job
back,
i
won't
vote
for
the
union.
i
definitely
told
him
i
would
not
vote
for
the
union.
after
he
didn't
give
me
my
job
back
of
course
i
had
no
other
choice,
i
went
on
with
the
union.”
“what
did
he
say
when
you
said
to
him?
what
did
he
say?
“well,
he
couldn't
put
me
back
to
work.”
now,
i
don't
know
frankly
what
to
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
this
is
volume
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
as
i
say,
i
think
you'll
find
that
the
part
i'm
reading
from
is
the
board's
specification
of
it.
it's
--
it's
the
same
witness
but
it's
different
--
different
testimony.
it
all
took
place
in
one
time.
and
we
just
specified
different
sections
of
it.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
that
--
it
was
printed
in
the
large
type
as
what
the
board
specified
and
that
which
is
printed
the
small
type
is
what
i
specified.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
it
all
came
out
of
the
--
when
i
--
i
--
i
must
state
in
my
own
defense,
i
didn't
arrange
for
the
printing
of
this
record.
i
simply
specified
that
portion
that
i
thought
should
go
in
addition
what
they
specify.
on
the
next
page,
they
are
--
don't
want
to
appear
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
well,
i'm
in
volume
ii
at
the
bottom
of
the
pages
--
page
333.
she
stated
upon
questioning
by
the
trial
examiner.
at
the
top
of
the
page
there,
he
said
that
if
the
union
didn't
go
in,
he
put
me
back
to
work.
i
assume
that's
the
testimony
that
the
---
that
the
board
was
relying
upon.
of
course
mr.
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
that's
mr.
sharp
who
was
the
manager
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
mr.
sharp.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
he
was
a
witness,
yes
sir,
in
the
several
days.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
yes
sir,
he
certainly
was.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
he
denied
that
he
told
her
that.
and
of
course
that's
a
--
that's
a
question
of
who
you're
going
to
believe
but
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
on
page
333.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
this
is
the
--
the
numbering
is
at
the
bottom.
the
statement
is
at
the
top
of
the
page.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
yes
sir.
now,
that
was
on
questioning
by
the
trial
examiner.
he
asked
it
two
or
three
times
and
finally
she
came
out
with
that
but
she
said
it
nevertheless,
so
i
suppose
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
that's
correct
sir,
she
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
yes
sir.
she
testified
that
she
had
signed
a
union
card
because
there
was
no
testimony
of
anybody
connected
with
management
who's
present
at
the
time
or
the
--
there's
no
testimony
then
above
the
management
saw
it
or
heard
about
it
or
anything
else
until
this
conversation
a
day
after
she
was
discharged
when
she
and
the
manager
were
discussing
unions.
he
stated
that
i
understand
you've
been
working
with
the
union
organizers.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
yes
sir,
she
was
discharged
the
day
before.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
now
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
well
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
be
more
appropriate
to
tell
you
at
this
point
what
the
employer's
testimony
was
concerning
the
discharge
of
this
woman
and
then
i'll
have
to
come
back
to
her
testimony
because
she
denied
some
of
it.
the
employer's
evidence
concerning
this
woman
was
that
first
she
was
not
producing
in
accordance
with
the
production
quotas
and
that
she
had
been
employed
by
this
company
for
some
six
months
or
so
and
rather
than
showing
improvement,
the
last
six
works
--
last
six
weeks
that
she
worked,
she
actually
had
make
up
where
she
had
previously
made
her
production
quotas.
i
think
you
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
was
a
brand
new
little
company
that
employed
a
hundred
or
so
people
and
that
they
were
going
through
a
training
period
and
that
this
was
at
--
the
end
of
about
five
or
six
months
of
the
training
period.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
there
were
worksheets
in
the
record
which
showed
her
make
up
faith.
it
showed
that
the
first
several
weeks
she
was
employed,
she
made
exactly
the
pay
for
40
hours
which
indicated
in
the
testimony
was
that
she
was
on
an
hourly
rate
at
that
time
because
she
was
just
beginning.
and
she
was
put
on
piece
rate.
for
several
weeks
she
had
a
--
she
had
what
they
called
“make
up
pay”
which
means
she
didn't
make
her
production
quotas.
and
then
for
few
weeks,
she
made
her
quotas
and
then
for
six
weeks,
she
did
not
make
her
production
quotas.
that's
one
factor
which
is
in
this
record
and
there's
no
way
you
can
get
around.
the
--
her
production
record
established
that.
another
fact
there
was
that
the
work
which
she
did
was
not
satisfactory
and
in
that
regard,
we
had
six
witnesses
who
attempted
to
testify
that
her
work
--
the
work
she
did
was
shoddy,
that
a
great
deal
of
it
had
to
be
returned
and
redone.
three
of
those
witnesses
were
management
people.
the
other
three
were
just
ordinary
employees,
fellow
employees
of
hers
who
had
presumably
no
extra
ground
and
who
--
who
backed
up
what
the
management
said.
in
addition
to
that,
we
had
testimony
that
she
was
an
employee
who
was
constantly
causing
agitation
with
the
supervisor
that
she
would
not
take
instructions,
that
she
would
not
follow
orders,
that
she
rambled
and
complaining.
and
there
is
a
statement
in
the
--
in
the
record
that
she
complained
about
the
skimpy
cut
of
the
cloth
and
from
that
statement,
it
was
inferred
by
the
trial
examiner
and
the
board
that
the
reason
her
work
was
not
satisfactory
was
because
the
--
of
the
skimpy
cut
of
the
cloth
implying
i
suppose
that
this
was
a
marginal
operator
who
was
cutting
his
cloth
too
skimpy.
however,
there
is
no
other
testimony
concerning
that.
no
one
else
seemed
to
have
trouble
with
this
skimpy
cut
of
the
cloth.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
none
whatsoever,
none
whatsoever.
now,
bear
in
mind
that
this
discharge
was
right
at
the
very
outset
of
the
union
campaign.
there
was
no
campaigning,
at
least
the
record
shows.
it
doesn't
show
that
there
was
any
campaigning
in
the
plant
or
--
or
even
open
campaigning.
the
best
the
record
shows
is
that
the
organizers
were
going
around
to
these
peoples'
homes
attempting
to
sign
them
up.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
there
is
testimony
in
record,
yes
sir,
whether
the
testimony
was
credit,
there
was
not
a
little
proposition
but
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
testimony,
i
can't
point
to
the
page
because
i'm
not
prepared
to
point.
mr.
frostermann
and
also
her
supervisor
which
would
be
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
yes
sir.
her
supervisor,
i
believe
was
mrs.
hewing
also
testified
that
she
had
so
much
trouble
with
her
that
she,
herself
mrs.
hewing
was
put
to
tears
on
several
occasions.
now,
mrs.
yancey
denied
these
things,
denied
that
she
had
been
criticized.
our
contention
of
course
was
that
her
work
--
she
rather
than
showing
improvement
was
showing
a
decline
and
it
was
not
seemed
logical
as
somebody
would
not
have
spoken
to
her
and
our
testimony
was
that
they
had.
now,
i
realize
that
my
time
is
drawn
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
the
board,
this
particular
--
this
particular
case,
the
board
sustained.
they
examined
those
findings
in
every
respect.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
board
sustained,
they
examined
practically
everything.
i
think
they
dis
--
throughout
of
couple
of
this
8
(1)
findings
but
added
about
five
or
more
that
he
had
made
the
finding.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
yes.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
the
court,
this
particular
case,
i
assume
that
this
one
was
singled
out
because
it
--
it
did
bring
about
more
testimony
and
was
more
hotly
contested.
the
court
went
into
a
great
deal
of
details
concerning
this
mrs.
yancey.
the
court
was
not
impressed
that
she
was
in
ardent
or
active
union
worker
and
incidentally,
she
admitted
herself
that
she
didn't
sign
anybody
to
go
out
and
try
to
sign
people
up
for
the
union
which
is
usually
the
case
in
one
of
these
people.
the
court
went
into
--
as
i
say
a
detail
concerning
mrs.
yancey's
case
more
so
than
--
than
any
of
the
others.
the
court
was
not
impressed
with
the
findings
of
the
board
in
any
respect.
the
court
as
i
read
it
came
to
the
impression
this
was
simply
a
woman
who
had
signed
up
with
the
union
but
who
also
had
a
bad
production
record,
who
had
been
--
who
had
done
shoddy
work.
and
the
board
simply
had
not
provided
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
his
findings.
now,
he
stated
that
specifically.
and
he
says
at
the
outset
of
his
--
of
his
opinion
he
states
that
i
have
made
a
tedious
appraisal
of
this
record
going
from
one
of
these
books
to
the
others,
we've
done
here
a
few
minutes
ago
and
no
question
it.
it's
a
tedious
proposition.
this
trial
lasted
six
or
seven
days
and
there
were
well
over
thousand
pages
of
testimony.
now,
we
come
to
the
point
that
this
court
has
asked
--
i
assume
that
they
did
the
same
thing
which
is
right
into
the
teeth
of
the
pittsburgh
steamship
case,
right
in
to
the
teeth
of
the
very
case
that
they
cite
as
being
an
implication
that
this
court
has
been
critical
of
this
circuit
before.
i'm
referring
to
the
fant
milling
case,
but
the
fant
milling
case
is
an
--
is
an
illustration
of
what
this
court
is
done
up
to
now
with
these
cases
and
that
is
that
they
review
the
record
is
the
function
of
the
court
of
appeals.
congress
offered
to
put
that
responsibility
upon
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
1947,
they
attempted
to
put
added
responsibility
upon
them
in
order
to
ensure
the
families
in
reasonableness
of
their
orders.
this
court
in
fant
milling
suggested
to
the
fifth
circuit
first
rule
in
footnote
10
that
this
is
not
the
place
to
review
the
records,
cited
pittsburgh
steamship
and
then
stated
that
we
will
remand
the
case
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
but
if
the
facts
which
were
brought
out
in
the
dissenting
opinion
are
true
then
possibly
the
thing
should
be
enforced.
well,
the
case
went
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
they
enforced
it
per
curiam
without
a
dissent
or
anything
else.
prior
to
the
time
fant
milling
came
here,
there
had
been
no
decision
on
the
merits.
there
was
merely
a
dissenting
opinion
or
a
special
concurring
opinion
by
judge
hutchenson
which
suggested
and
he
didn't
think
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
that
record.
now
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
this
court
what
i
consider
the
real
issue
in
this
case
and
what
i
--
i
think
is
the
possible
result
if
the
board's
contention
is
followed
and
that
is
this.
if
you
take
that
contention
to
its
logical
conclusion,
it
will
mean
that
anytime
the
board
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
and
in
this
case,
a
prima
facie
case
would
be
union
membership
or
activities,
competent
knowledge,
and
some
anti-union
animus
on
the
part
of
the
company,
that
there
would
be
no
circumstances
under
which
the
court
of
appeals
could
reverse
them
and
that's
what
they
are
in
effect
saying.
and
they
criticized
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
frosty
morn
case
which
came
out
in
november
for
taking
issue
with
them
there.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
it's
true
if
the
evidence
on
the
board's
side
is
reasonably
equal
to
the
evidence
on
the
employer's
side,
we
can't
upset
it.
but
if
there's
evidence
to
prove
that
an
employee
has
given
just
cause
for
his
discharge,
then
just
because
there's
evidence
to
support
the
board
there,
does
not
mean
we
can't
upset
it
because
if
there
is
just
cause
for
discharge
and
the
man
is
discharged,
there
can
be
no
discrimination
because
anyone
who
committed
those
acts
would
have
been
discharged.
discrimination
is
treating
one
person
differently
than
you
would
treat
another.
the
second
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
there
was
about
200
exhibits
and
i
suppose
they
would
contend
from
those
without
any
testimony
explaining
them.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
there's
no
direct
evidence,
no.
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
no
sir.
the
board
put
in
90
somewhat
worksheets.
some
of
the
mrs.
yancey's
and
then
in
their
brief,
they
attempted
to
draw
analogy
but
there
was
no
testimony
that
you
could
compare
this
one
with
that
one
and
there
was
testimony
that
you
--
you
had
to
deal
with
these
different
jobs
on
a
specific
basis.
the
other
issue
which
i
think
is
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
t.
thompson
that's
right
sir
and
they
wouldn't
show
the
--
the
relative
difficulty
of
the
job
that
was
in
question
which
is
a
big
factor.
the
other
issue
in
this
case
is
this.
this
union
wrote
a
letter
to
this
employer
in
which
it
stated
the
following
people
of
the
members
of
our
organizing
committee.
the
court
found
and
we
here
contend
that
this
letter
was
not
only
designed
but
did
have
the
effect
of
blinding
the
board
to
any
logical
and
reasonable
consideration
of
the
--
of
true
evidence
in
the
case.
and
the
true
test
for
that
is
if
you
turn
these
layoffs
around,
if
you
say
what
the
board
has
said
to
us,
you
got
to
keep
this
particular
employee
nelly
hood
or
nelly
wood
or
what
have
you.
then
you've
got
to
layoff
somebody
else
because
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
layoff
itself
was
stipulated
to
be
economically
necessary.
so
you've
got
a
layoff
which
is
necessary.
somebody's
got
to
be
laid
off.
now,
what
the
board
has
told
us
is
that
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
nine
of
them,
that's
all
we
were
charged
with
on
the
layoff.
you've
got
to
keep
all
nine
of
them
although
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
which
would
justify
at
least
seven
of
them
being
kept
under
any
circumstances
except
that
they
found
an
anti-union
motive.
that's
not
what
the
law
was
designed
to
do.
it
was
not
designed
to
promote
discrimination
in
favor
of
union
members
anymore
than
it
was
designed
to
promote
discrimination
against
them.
i
appreciate
your
attention,
thank
you.
