about

judges.
justice

i
can
tell
you
from
personal
experience
if
district

is
sitting

designation
to
the

well,
i
have
the
record
in
here
in

of
me
now,
stephenson's
testimony,

the
trial
examiner
was
referring
or
was
he
just
referring
to
the
fact
that
he
--
he
blinked
his
eyes
and
blushed
and
so
on,
something
that
wouldn't
appear
in
the

of
