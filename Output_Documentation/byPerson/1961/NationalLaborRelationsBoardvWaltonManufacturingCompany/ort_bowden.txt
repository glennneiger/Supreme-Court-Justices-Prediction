mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court
and
mr.
come.
first,
i
would
like
to
comment
by
saying
that
the
figures
and
the
percentages
that
mr.
come
presented
here
yesterday
as
to
the
percentage
of
reversals
or
affirmations
by
the
circuit
courts
do
not
in
themselves
impressed
me
too
much
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
well
may
be
that
the
court
which
affirms
the
most
is
the
one
that
it's
not
applying
rule
that
you
had
in
universal
camera
company
case.
i
think
the
figures
that
i
have
seen
on
the
--
on
the
courts
would
indicate,
as
justice
frankfurter
mentioned,
that
the
fifth
circuit
had
handled
more
labor
cases
than
all
the
other
circuits
combined
with
exception
of
the
second
circuit.
and
two,
the
fifth
circuit
had
affirmed
more
cases
at
the
labor
board
with
the
exception
of
the
second
circuit.
and
it's
the
fifth
circuit
that
also
refused
to
enforce
more
cases
than
any
circuits.
there
are
other
circuits,
i
believe
it
was
the
sixth
that
had
affirmed
two
cases
and
denied
enforcement
in
form
which
is
not
too
good
a
percentage
if
you
want
to
approach
on
the
percentage
before
us.
now
at
the
outset,
i
must
--
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
yes.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
i
can
explain
that,
your
honor.
it's
--
it
may
do
with
the
sanction,
the
thinking.
i
think
there
is
a
certain
--
there's
less
regimentation
i
--
if
i
may
use
that
word
as
to
thinking
of
lawyers
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
they're
--
they
could
be
that.
and
they're
--
i
think
they're
--
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
that
could
be
an
element.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
i'll
--
i'll
have
to
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
yes
--
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
that
would
account
for.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
and
you
--
it
might
--
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
it
might
be
this
--
is
the
proposition
that
we'd
have
presented,
too,
your
honor.
to
the
fact
that
there
is
more
unionization
at
this
time
in
this
south
and
pass
where
it
is
or
any
other
section
so
it
actually
--
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
that
is
another
fact,
your
honor.
i
think
all
of
which
possibly.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
now,
at
outset,
i
must
state
that
i
agree
with
the
statement
that
the
general
counsel
had
in
their
position
for
their
brief.
and
that
this
case
standing
alone
would
not
be
sufficient
to
invoke
this
court's
supervisory
powers,
that
statement
appeared.
it
is
therefore
where
some
apprehension
that
i
find
the
interest
of
my
client
being
considered
along
with
another
case
although
which
i
have
no
control.
it
is
apparent
that
the
government
itself
is
violating
this
court's
rule
in
the
pittsburgh
steamship
case
when
the
purpose
of
this
case
is
to
do
nothing
more
than
the
old
return,
the
verdict
and
the
finding
and
the
judgment
of
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal.
my
reading
of
that
case
indicates
that
this
court
expressly
that
it
was
not
the
policy
nor
the
function
of
this
court
to
review
each
and
every
individual
decision.
now,
they
do
not
show
that,
when
i
say
'they',
i'm
referring
to
the
government,
that
the
findings
of
the
fifth
circuit
on
these
questions
are
at
variance
with
any
other
circuits.
so
we're
not
here
determining
a
conflict
between
circuits.
they
have
laid
before
you
the
proposition
that
since
the
percentages
one
thing
and
one
circuit
and
another
thing
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
fifth
circuit
must
be
wrong.
that
was
a
reading
from
my
statement
saying,
“we
have
just
as
much
right
to
look
at
the
cases
that
decided
in
the
other
circuits
and
see
if
they
are
correctly
applying
the
rule
and
if
in
fact
the
rule
is
not
being
correctly
applied
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
that
court
is
acknowledged
in
its
responsibilities
as
this
court
has
directed
the
court
should
do
in
the
universal
camera
case.
it
is
also
apparent
from
the
review
of
this
case
but
the
general
counsel
is
seeking
to
impose
to
form
the
fifth
circuit
standards
on
a
reviewing
court
that
the
universal
camera
case
condemns.
i
like
to
--
for
a
moment,
discuss
the
facts
in
this
case.
i'm
--
hadn't
--
didn't
think
it
was
proper
frankly
because
of
the
holding
in
the
pittsburgh
steamship
case.
but
since
the
facts
are
before
the
court,
i'd
like
to
make
some
observations.
but
this
case
may
be
divided
into
two
parts
for
practical
purposes
that
is
8
(a)
(5)
part
which
is
the
refusal
to
bargain
in
good
faith
part
of
the
violation.
and
it
has
a
tender
8
(a)
(3)
charges
which
is
the
replacement
of
strikers.
now,
if
the
bargaining
was
not
unlawful,
then
the
general
counsel
conceded
in
the
case
that
then
the
--
there
was
no
question
of
reinstatement
of
the
strikers.
if
the
bargain
is
found
to
be
unlawful,
then
of
course
there
is
a
question
of
reinstatement
of
the
strikers.
the
second
part
of
the
case,
we
have
8
(a)
(1)
violations
which
the
trial
examiner
himself
characterized
as
a
miscellany
of
minor
charges
of
interference,
restraint
and
coercion.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
criticism
that
the
general
counsel
throws
at
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
applies
in
the
main
to
this
miscellany
of
minor
charges,
interference,
restraint
and
coercion
which
is
the
basis
of
8
(a)
(1)
charges
here.
now,
let's
examine
the
first
part
of
this
case
which
i
will
call
are
refused
the
bargaining
part,
the
8
(a)
(5)
violation.
now,
the
--
the
general
--
the
trial
examiner
and
the
counsels
here
goes
into
a
year
bargaining
period
and
fixed
out
one
incident
and
says
“right
here,
you
refused
to
bargain.”
we're
talking
about
now
the
december
the
18th
meeting.
the
--
it
maybe
well
and
few
comments
made
to
the
court
to
read
what
the
trial
examiner
said
about
this.
it'll
be
in
page
114
and
115.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
volume
i,
i
believe
this
is
--
he
says
this,
“through
the
false
significance
of
the
december
18th
meeting
can
be
determine
only
in
the
light
of
later
developments”.
this
appear
--
this
much
appears
from
the
meeting
itself
and
the
advance
which
immediately
preceded
it.
then
he
said,
“this
time,
it
was
the
company
which
delayed
setting
of
a
negotiating
meeting
at
a
crucial
time
when
it
appeared
from
a
private
meeting
without
benefit
of
counsel
then
they
agreed
it
was
near.”
now,
here's
a
statement
he
made
at
the
same,
“the
unfortunate
circumstances
of
the
freeze
brought
home
to
the
union
realizations
that
this
earlier
--
earlier
dalliance
in
the
negotiation
had
placed
that
bargaining
position
in
peril
plus
the
urgent
deadline”.
he
threatens
strike.
he
attempts
to
force
all
use
of
the
freeze
as
an
excuse
for
further
delay.
now,
he
goes
on
--
that's
his
summation.
now,
let's
turn
to
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
this
regard
which
is
in
volume
ii
page
79
to
80.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
yes,
sir.
the
fifth
circuit
summarizes,
as
i
understand,
the
trial
examiner
now
is
treating
only
this
as
a
one
incident
without
any
relation
at
all
to
the
fiat
as
they
existed
at
that
time.
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
opinion
says
on
the
nights
of
december
the
12th
and
13th,
disastrous
freezes
occurred
in
the
florida
citrus
belt.
there
was
no
way
so
the
examiner
found
by
which
the
extent
of
the
laws
and
the
effect
on
the
industry
could
be
gauged
at
that
time.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
sir?
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
volume
iii
sir,
page
79
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
m.h.
walker
general
manager
of
the
respondent
had
been
informed
that
because
of
the
freezes
other
teamster
locals
had
agreed
to
the
suspension
on
negotiations
with
other
citrus
processors
in
order
for
the
latter
to
appraise
its
situation
in
light
of
the
freezes.
walker
came
to
the
meeting
of
december
18th
which
commenced
about
2
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
intending
to
ask
for
delay
in
the
negotiation.
this
intention
was
announced
at
the
opening
of
the
meeting.
the
chief
union
representative,
david
wingate
refused
to
listen
to
any
statement
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
and
insisted
on
first
stating
his
position.
the
chief
union
negotiator
informed
their
respondent
that
the
freezes
were
not
a
factor
which
would
be
considered
in
the
negotiations.
he
informed
the
respondent's
representatives
that
the
union's
negotiating
committee
was
authorized
to
call
a
strike
whenever
it's
saw
fit.
and
he
gave
the
respondent
a
deadline
of
400
that
afternoon
to
agree
upon
a
contract
or
give
assurances
that
a
contract
would
be
agreed
on.
fifth
circuit
says
the
examiner
and
the
board
reached
the
conclusion
that
walker,
the
respondent's
general
manager,
should
have
made
his
plea
for
suspension
on
negotiations
but
we
see
no
reason
why
he
should
have
done
it
in
view
of
wingate's
declaration
that
freezes
or
no
freezes,
the
respondent
must
within
two
hours
commit
itself
to
a
contract.
the
doing
of
a
useless
and
feudal
fighting
is
no
more
required
in
collective
bargaining
and
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
union
that
in
--
in
other
activities.
now,
you
can
see
from
the
readings
that
the
fifth
circuit
considered
the
record
as
a
whole.
now,
let's
go
back
and
see
what
the
examiner
stated
about
the
bargain
of
the
union
altogether.
the
examiner
stated
as
follows,
“indeed,
through
a
combination
of
bad
luck”,
now,
there's
no
reference
or
record
to
what
he
means
by
bad
luck,
“and
bad
bargaining
techniques,
the
union
had
permitted
the
negotiations
to
proceed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
create
a
situation
in
which
respondents
owned
alleged
good
faith
bargaining
could
not
be
tested”.
now,
when
we're
considering
whether
the
fifth
circuit
accepted
the
testimony
of
mr.
stephenson
and
did
not
accept
the
testimony
went
to
mr.
wingate,
we
have
to
take
in
consideration
that
mr.
wingate
was
the
chief
union
witness
throughout
this
--
this
period
and
negotiator
and
mr.
stephenson
was
testifying
about
the
same
period
for
behalf
of
the
respondent.
now,
wingate,
if
we
want
to
get
into
why
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
accept
this
testimony,
was
found
by
the
trial
examiner
himself
to
be
inept,
careless
and
in
numerous
cases
during
this
nine
and
a
half
months
of
bargaining
prior
to
december
18th,
he
found
wingate
time
and
time
again
misrepresenting
it.
and
he
stated
in
his
report.
for
example,
wingate
testified
that
the
company
--
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
i'm
reading
now
--
i
don't
have
that
it's
in
the
--
if
you
--
it's
in
the
trial
examiner's
report
which
would
be
--
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
yes,
sir.
the
exact
reference,
i
just
made
a
note
as
to
statements
without
--
wingate
had
testified
that
the
company
never
offered
to
itself.
the
old
citrus
worker's
labor
agreement
was
such
modification
as
the
union
desired
to
make
as
the
basis
for
settling.
bargaining
had
been
going
on
to
some
time.
but
the
trial
examiners
found
that
wingate
did
state
that
he
was
willing
to
go
along
with
the
old
contract.
now,
the
record
shows
for
example
that
wingate
had
delayed
bargaining
because
he
wanted
to
go
to
teamster
convention.
now,
i
understand
that
during
this
period
of
time
from
february
to
december
the
18th,
the
trial
examiner
very
carefully
each
time
said
that
this
concerned
no
crucial
matter.
this
was
not
a
crucial
time.
and
therefore,
he
didn't
attach
in
to
forum.
but
on
december
the
18th
for
some
reason,
he
suddenly
decided
that
was
crucial.
and
there's
no
explanation
in
the
record
why
the
trial
examiner
would
think
that
december
the
18th
was
crucial
and
december
the
17th
not
crucial.
however,
he
makes
this
statement
and
in
explaining
wingate's
delay
during
this
eight
and
a
half
months
of
bargaining
prior
to
december
the
18th,
he
says
that
it
concern
no
crucial
matter
that
it
was
not
a
crucial
period
and
words
of
that
import.
the
record
will
show
that
the
company
had
bargained
with
this
union
from
the
certification
in
february
to
december
the
18th.
during
that
period
of
time
and
for
the
period
of
time
to
january
the
28th,
the
union
at
ho
--
at
--
used
four
different
negotiators
in
the
bargaining
that
none
of
the
negotiators
may
took
over
had
any
conception
of
what
the
other
negotiators
had
negotiated
that
the
company
during
these
changes
had
to
furnish
a
new
union
negotiator
with
contracts
and
go
through
it,
make
notes
for
them
so
that
they
would
know
what
it
transpired
in
the
previous
bargaining.
there's
testimony
here
by
mr.
wingate
in
which
he
claimed
that
he
furnished
a
company
proposal
in
which
the
trial
examiner
himself
said
that
it
was
apparent
that
mr.
wingate
was
in
error,
had
not
furnished
us
with
the
proposal.
the
transcript
will
show
and
the
testimony
will
show
that
even
though
company
representatives
had
traveled
400
miles
to
attend
a
bargaining
session
that
even
though
the
union
was
present
in
the
town
that
they
refused
to
come
to
the
meeting.
either
--
the
transcript
and
the
record
would
also
show
that
mr.
wingate
broke
the
bargaining
at
all
on
october
the
31st
in
1957
stated
that
he
had
to
get
work
for
from
the
international.
now,
he
never
requested
another
meeting
until
this
meeting
at
december
the
18th
yet
the
trial
examiner
brushes
that
at
all
by
saying
it
concern
no
crucial
period.
(inaudible)
december
the
18th
was
a
crucial
period
and
he
found
that
because
mr.
walker,
the
company's
general
manager,
did
not
assume
a
knee
on
the
floor
attitude
and
begged
for
delay
in
view
the
freeze
that
that
was
a
refusal
to
bargain.
i
submit
that
the
fifth
circuit
had
every
reasons
your
honor
to
adopt
and
--
and
find
that
there's
no
evidence
of
bargaining.
a
couple
of
this
would
apply
too
that
there
is
not
one
word
or
record
--
in
the
record
prior
to
december
18th
meeting
in
which
could
be
considered
as
anti-union
remark
or
anti-union
animus
this
company
had
for
years
dealt
with
unions.
this
company
had
for
years
satisfactorily
negotiated,
went
out
of
strike.
and
they
were
doing
it
this
time
even
with
the
flames
and
the
roadblocks
and
the
difficulties.
mr.
walker,
the
general
manager
of
the
company,
said
in
september,
he
attended
negotiations
and
wanted
to
know
why
we
weren't
getting
along
faster
because
of
the
fact
that
the
season,
the
operating
season
was
at
hand
and
that
he
wanted
the
contract
settled
before
the
operating
season
started
yet
the
trial
examiner
said
that
this
concerned
no
crucial
period
but
on
december
the
18th,
it
did.
why?
i
do
not
know.
now,
keeping
in
mind
that
this
incident,
if
it
happened
at
all,
with
holly
occurred
afterwards
their
--
the
records
from
february
until
december
the
18th
has
no
record
of
any
anti-union
animus
or
--
or
anti-union
statesmanship.
we
would
found
at
that
time
to
have
not
bargaining
in
good
faith
because
we
did
not
ask
for
the
suspension.
it
is
a
well-known
fact
and
the
trial
examiner
states
that
all
the
other
citrus
plants,
minute
maid,
adams
packing,
we
have
incorporated
some
of
those
reports
in
our
record,
were
granted
suspension
by
the
same
union
for
the
purposes
of
bargaining.
i
will
show
you
and
it
--
i
will
not
show
you,
but
it
appears
on
our
appendix
that
a
similar,
almost
on
all
fours
case,
such
as
this
was
tried
by
the
teamsters
and
by
the
board
in
reference
to
adams
packing
company
and
the
trial
examiner
in
that
case
reached
an
absolute
conclusion
under
identical
circumstances.
and
then
to
--
to
bring
and
to
paint
the
picture
of
what
the
situation
was
at
that
time,
we
will
have
to
show
that
on
--
on
december
the
12th
and
the
13th
with
these
freezes
in
which
the
industry
did
not
know
whether
the
entire
crop
was
lost
or
not
for
the
season
that
the
union
comes
in
and
says,
“if
you
don't
sign
a
contract
in
two
hours,
we're
going
to
strike”.
in
decem
--
on
january
the
10th
--
9th
and
10th
this
--
this
--
the
area
again
was
hit
by
freezes.
it
was
during
that
period
of
time
that
the
union
actually
called
a
strike.
now,
the
trial
examiners
claim
that
the
company
exploited
the
freeze.
how
he
reached
that
conclusion,
he
does
not
state
when
it
is
common
sense
would
dictate
that
at
the
time
of
the
freezes,
when
the
fruit
has
to
be
processed
before
it
warms
up
and
began
to
ferment
that
it
was
to
the
answers
to
the
company
to
work
night
and
day
to
process
what
fruit
was
available.
and
we
would
not
exploit
a
freeze
by
trying
to
call
a
strike
during
that
period
of
time.
yet
that's
his
finding.
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
go
along
with
that
finding
either.
now,
in
reference
to
holly,
which
is
the
other
incident,
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
made
a
fair
evaluation
of
that
testimony.
when
you
keep
in
mind
that
we
--
holly
is
at
most
a
plant
guard
that
mr.
stephenson,
the
general
manager
or
production
manager
in
--
in
that
case,
would
go
to
the
trouble
seek
him
out
and
have
such
a
conversation
with
this
man.
now,
holly's
testimony
cared
of
his
own
death-wound
and
that
mr.
stephenson
--
mr.
walker
testified
that
he,
as
general
manager
of
the
company,
made
the
decision
as
to
the
rate
--
wages
that
mr.
walker
or
that
mr.
stephenson
did
not
and
that
he
made
it
at
the
time
it
was
announced
and
it
was
his
decision.
stephen
--
the
--
holly
testified
too
in
reference
to
the
petitions
but
another
employee
unrefuted
testified
that
he
got
the
--
the
idea
from
the
other
citrus
plants
and
that
he
started
the
petitioners
to
decertify
that
union
and
that
the
company
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
if
the
trial
examiner
found
that
although
mr.
stephenson
did
not
succeed
en
--
enticing
mr.
holly
that
he
otherwise
succeeded
by
mr.
scheuer.
when
that
is
in
the
testimony
as
all
and
was
explicitly
denied
by
mr.
scheuer
unrefuted
it
to
place.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
in
going
over
to
this
case
considered
the
record
as
a
whole.
they
did
not
do
as
mr.
come
would
held
us
to
do
that
is
going
in
and
take
the
testimony
of
mr.
stephenson
and
mr.
holly
in
isolation
and
view
that
without
re
--
considering
that
with
the
whole
record.
it
is
our
contention
that
when
the
fifth
circuit
and
any
circuit
refused
the
record
as
the
whole,
that
is
--
he
is
entitled
and
must
necessarily
read
all
these
parts
together
and
therefore
reach
the
conclusion
on
that
basis.
now,
there
was
some
mention
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
about
these
colloquies
that
the
--
that
often
come
in
trial
and
i
agree
with
him
that
they
are
informed.
and
when
you
consider
that
when
a
trial
examiner
goes
out
on
his
own
without
any
reason
except
to
merely
express
his
personal
opinions
and
make
statements
in
the
record
like
this
trial
examiner
did
about
a
witness
who
did
not
even
testify
then
i
think
that
is
something
that
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
ought
to
consider
when
they're
considering
his
evaluation
of
testimony
of
witness
who
did
testify.
he
goes
the
great
lengths
in
one
place
to
take
a
part
a
witness
by
the
name
of
roberts
who
was
--
did
not
testify.
and
he
explained
in
great
detail
why
the
general
counsel
did
not
call
mr.
roberts.
none
of
which
was
necessary
and
he
chooses
words.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
he
was
excused
in
the
presence
of
this
man
from
testimony
because
it
was
apparent,
if
your
court
please,
that
he
had
handled
some
of
the
negotiations
and
--
and
it
was
--
they
were
trying
to
explain
why
the
general
counsel
didn't
call
them
to
testify
as
to
his
part
of
negotiation.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
he
actually
didn't
show
after
--
i
shouldn't
have
said
a
witness
but
an
individual
i
should
say.
but
the
trial
examiner
referred
him
as
a
defector
and
words
that
he
adjoined
in
the
opposition
meaning
that
he
had
at
that
time
going
to
work
with
minute
maid
and
that
the
--
the
trial
examiner
viewed
employers
at
opposition.
there
were
other
statements
by
the
trial
examiner.
and
there
were
statements
too
by
the
general
counsel
who
tried
the
case.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
yes.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
yes.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
it's
my
recollection
that
mr.
wingate
while
he
had
been
present
previously
took
over
the
actual
negotiations
at
the
october
meetings
and
roberts
immediately
preceded
him
as
the
teamster
negotiator.
and
he
was
trying
to
explain
why
rob
--
roberts
was
not
used
since
we
have
been
charged
for
refusal
to
bargain
back
as
far
as
july.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
that's
correct.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
not
at
that
time.
but
which
is
all
the
more
reason
why
there's
no
reason
for
the
trial
examiner
to
go
to
the
extent
he
did
to
--
to
criticize.
now,
the
general
counsel
in
that
case
in
a
colloquy
which
is
reported,
i
believe,
in
the
brief
of
the
board
was
asked
that
if
going
to
the
management
side
necessarily
affected
the
force
of
the
old
and
the
general
counsel
replied
“sometimes
i
wonder”.
this
is
in
the
presence
of
witnesses.
and
apparently,
it
was
an
expression
of
which
the
trial
examiner
agreed.
i
can't
find
--
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
the
actual
prosecutes.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
--
sir.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
no,
but
i
think
it's
on
--
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
--
call
for.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
no,
but
i
think
that
that
is
on
call
for
your
honor
--
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
--
to
test
that
kind
of
--
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
that's
correct.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
that's
correct,
sir.
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
well,
it's
in
the
brief
of
the
appellant
counsel.
it's
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
some
reproduced
--
page
26.
mr.
o.r.t.
bowden
the
government's
brief.
it's
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
in
the
--
(voice
overlap)
set
forth
in
passing
on
this.
it
is
our
position,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
fifth
circuit
fulfill
its
functions
and
the
directions
of
this
court
as
set
out
in
the
universal
camera
case
and
that
that
court
is
accepting
the
responsibility
which
this
court
urged
upon
it.
at
this
time,
as
my
friend
and
colleague
from
georgia
said
yesterday,
i
would
like
to
state
that
i
object
to
the
use
of
the
word
“grossly”
misapplied
standards
when
directed
through
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
because
judge
jones
who
wrote
this
decision
was
a
--
was
a
member,
before
going
to
the
bench,
to
one
of
the
largest
most
respected
law
firms
in
my
state
of
florida.
and
it
does
not
reflect
and
we
do
not
believe
that
any
such
allegation
could
be
appropriately
addressed
to
him.
i
know
the
judges,
i
respect
them,
i
love
them
and
i
certainly
object
in
any
such
criticism
as
grossly
misapplying
the
law
at
anytime.
now,
i
thank
you.
