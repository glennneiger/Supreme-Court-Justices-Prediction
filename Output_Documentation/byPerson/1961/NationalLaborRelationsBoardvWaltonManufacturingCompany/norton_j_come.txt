mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
review
the
judgement
of
that
court
denying
enforcement
of
a
board
order
requiring
the
respondent,
walton
manufacturing
company,
to
reinstate
with
back
pay
13
employees
who
the
board
found
were
discriminated
against
because
of
their
union
activity.
the
basic
question
is
whether
the
fifth
circuit
in
concluding
that
the
board's
findings
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
on
the
record
as
a
whole,
grossly
misapplied
the
standard
of
review
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
universal
camera
case.
now,
in
universal
camera,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
11
years
ago,
the
court
held
that
a
reviewing
court
in
determining
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence
as
a
whole
to
support
the
board's
findings
of
fact.
and
incidentally,
section
10
(e)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
provides
that
if
there
is
substantial
evidence
on
the
record
as
a
whole
to
support
the
board's
findings
of
fact,
those
findings
shall
be
conclusive
on
review.
universal
camera,
this
court
held
that
in
determining
this
question,
the
reviewing
court
is
entitled
to
look
not
only
at
the
evidence
which
supports
the
board's
view
but
also
at
that
which
attracts
from
it.
and
it
may
set
aside,
i'm
quoting
now,
“a
board
decision
when
it
cannot
conscientiously
find
that
the
evidence
supporting
that
decision
is
substantial
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
record
in
its
entirely
furnishes.”
however,
at
the
same
time,
the
court
pointed
out
that
this
does
not
mean
and
i'm
quoting
again,
“that
a
court
may
displace
a
board's
choice
between
two
fairly
conflicting
views
even
though
the
court
would
justifiably
have
made
a
different
choice,
had
the
matter
had
been
before
it
de
novo.”
in
other
words
as
we
read
universal
camera
and
has
all
of
the
other
courts
of
appeals
have
been
reading
it.
it
recognizes
that
the
task
of
making
determinations
of
credibility
and
of
weighing
the
conflicting
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
credited
testimony,
a
task
which
congress
entrusted
primarily
to
the
board.
the
function
of
the
reviewing
court
is
not
to
redetermine
these
questions
de
novo
but
merely
to
determine
whether
the
choice
made
by
the
board
was
a
reasonable
one
and
the
like
of
the
entire
record.
now,
the
fifth
circuit,
as
i
shall
attempt
to
show,
has
had
difficulty
in
adhering
to
this
standard
particularly
in
discriminatory
discharged
cases.
in
those
cases
in
particular,
its
practice
is
to
set
aside
the
board's
finding
of
unlawful
motivation
where
the
employer
can
point
the
some
incident
or
shortcoming
on
the
part
of
the
employee
that
might
have
been
the
cause
of
the
discharge.
the
board
cannot
draw
the
contrary
inference
unless
there
is
evidence
that
directly
contradicts
the
cost
assigned
by
the
employer.
now,
this
practice,
we
submit,
in
effect
denies
the
board
the
power
to
choose
between
two
fairly
conflicting
views
and
it's
contrary
to
our
reading
of
the
standard
of
review
as
enunciated
in
universal
camera.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i'm
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
they
have
misevaluated
the
record
in
this
particular
case.
however,
we
would
not
be
here
if
it
were
limited
to
this
particular
case.
this
is
a
problem
that
has
been
going
on
since
the
universal
camera
decision.
in
many
cases
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
fifth
circuit,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
thought
that
we
had
made
such
a
showing
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
we
also
have
some
statistics
there,
which
i
was
going
to
allude
to
a
little
later
on
to
show
how
far
out
of
line
the
fifth
circuit
is
with
the
--
with
the
other
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
should
like
to
first
address
myself
to
the
facts
of
this
case
to
show
what
we
think
the
court
did
wrong
and
then
try
to
indicate
that
the
error
is
a
more
deep-seated
one
than
as
presented
by
this
particular
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
there
are
--
about
seven.
mr.
norton
j.
come
my
research
indicates
that
it
does
not
make
much
of
a
difference
who
--
it's
--
it's
a
problem
that
seems
to
be
present
throughout
the
--
throughout
the
circuit
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
for
that
reason,
i
--
among
other
things,
i
was
very
careful
in
reviewing
the
past
histories
to
see
whether
it
can
be
attributed
simply
to
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
can
appreciate
that.
but
first
of
all,
my
study
of
the
cases
indicates
that
it's
not
limit
to
that.
secondly,
as
i
will
hope
to
develop,
i
think
that
the
problem
stems
from
the
tex-o-kan
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
was
handed
down
in
1941
before
the
universal
camera
and
it
is
the
fact
that
the
court
continues
to
--
to
adhere
to
the
principles
enunciated
in
tex-o-kan
which
we
submit
are
erroneous
that
we
get
the
problem
that
--
that
we
do.
well,
let
me
tell
you
a
little
something
about
the
facts
of
this
case.
in
november
of
1957,
the
amalgamated
clothing
workers
embarked
on
a
campaign
to
organize
respondent's
employees.
respondent
was
opposed
to
the
union
and
sought
to
defeat
it
not
merely
by
expressing
opposition
to
it
but
by
such
coercive
nature
as
surveillance
of
union
organizers,
interrogation
of
employees
and
threats
of
job
loss.
these
are
not
mere
isolated
acts.
the
board
found
that
this
added
up
to
restraint
and
coercion
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1),
and
the
court
below
agreed
except
in
one
or
two
minor
respects
and
enforce
a
cease-and-desist
order
against
this
pattern
of
restraint
and
coercion.
now,
in
the
midst
of
this
8
(a)
(1)
activity,
four
employees
are
discharged
and
shortly
thereafter,
nine
more
are
laid
off.
now,
the
board
found
that
these
employes
were
so
affected
because
of
their
union
activity
and
that
the
respondent
does
discriminate
it
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(3).
the
respondent
on
the
other
hand
contended
that
the
13
employees
were
selected
because
they
were
poor
workers
or
less
efficient
than
other
employees.
and
the
court
below
accepted
the
--
the
reasons
assigned
by
the
respondent
and
set
aside
the
board's
order
--
the
board's
findings
of
illegal
motivation,
even
though
as
i
will
show
in
a
moment,
they
were
not
without
rational
support.
let
me
just
start
with
one
of
the
--
the
first
employee
that
was
--
the
board
found
with
discriminatorily
discharge.
her
name
is
lucille
yancey
and
she
was
discharged
in
december
4,
shortly
after
she
had
joined
the
union
and
let
the
union
organizers
used
her
home.
plant
superintendent
forstermann
told
her
there
was
not
enough
work
for
her.that's
the
reason
he
gave
her
when
he
was
discharged.
she
insisted
on
seeing
maura
sharp
was
the
principle
operating
official
and
according
to
yancey's
testimony
which
the
trial
examiner
and
the
board
credited,
sharp
first
repeated
the
reason
given
by
forstermann,
there
wasn't
enough
to
work.
and
--
then
he
added
in
any
event
or
work
was
unsatisfactory.
yancey
asserted
that
there
was
another
reason
because
she
had
never
been
criticized
according
to
her
credited
testimony
for
her
work,
and
this
is
credited
testimony,
sharp
handed
her
a
union
paper
and
said,
“well,
lucille,
i
tell
you.
i've
heard
that
you
and
your
husband
have
been
working
with
the
union
organizers.
she
further
testified
that
she
told
sharp
that
her
job
meant
more
to
her
than
the
union
and
that
she
voted
against
the
union
if
she
could
have
her
job
back.
sharp
says
no
that
you
might
be
able
to
put
her
back
if
the
union
drive
fail.
now
here,
you
have
--
if
you
accept
the
credited
testimony,
even
direct
evidence
of
a
discriminatory
motive
and
yet
the
board's
finding
of
illegal
motivation
was
upset,
because
respondent's
witnesses
testified
that
yancey's
work
was
poor
that
she
was
uncooperative.
and
to
be
sure,
these
are
reasons
that
might
justify
a
discharge.
the
board,
however,
on
--
on
this
record
was
certainly
entitled
to
weigh
the
cause
that
was
assigned
against
these
other
factors
and
was
certainly
not
unreasonable
in
concluding
that
it
was
more
likely
that
against
she
was
discharged
because
of
her
union
activity.
now,
i
don't
want
to
go
into
all
13
of
the
discriminatory
discharges
and
layoffs.
but
the
pattern
in
all
of
them
is
about
the
same.
you
have
evidence
which
could
have
afforded
cause
with
the
layoffs.
as
against
that,
you
have
the
fact
that
the
layoffs
or
the
discharges
occurred
on
the
hills
of
this
extensive
campaign
of
restraint
and
coercion
as
the
board
found
to
violate
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
which
the
--
which
the
court
agreed.
you
have
the
further
fact
that
on
analysis
some
of
the
reasons
the
respondent
assigned
did
not
even
stand
up
under
scrutiny.
so
in
the
light
of
all
those
circumstances,
we
submit
that
the
board
was
clearly
not
unreasonable
in
concluding
that
the
evidence
of
discriminatory
motivation
preponderated
as
against
the
other
co
--
the
other
factors
that
respondent
assigned.
and
in
some
of
these
cases,
as
i
have
indicated,
you
had
actually
direct
evidence
of
a
discriminatory
motive
if
you
accept
the
credited
testimony,
the
board
and
the
trial
examiner.
now,
what
is
the
reason
for
the
court's
error
because
as
i
have
indicated
at
the
outset,
we
feel
that
it
goes
beyond
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
and
i
mentioned
the
tex-o-kan
case
which
was
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
1941.
in
that
case,
the
fifth
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
judge
sibley,
pointed
out
that
since
a
discriminatory
discharge
case
entails
a
back
pay
remedy
which
may
--
“the
court
may
impoverish
or
break
an
employer”
and
not
a
mere
or
cease-and-desist
order
a
higher
standard
of
proof
is
required.
and
what
is
that
standard?
and
here,
i'm
quoting
the
court
in
tex-o-kan,
“if
the
employer
were
to
testify
and
the
discharge
was
for
cause,
his
oath
cannot
be
disregarded
because
of
suspicion
that
he
may
be
lying.”
there
must
be
impeachment
of
him
or
substantial
contradiction
or
of
circumstances
raise
doubts.
they
must
be
inconsistent
with
the
positive
sworn
evidence
on
the
exact
point.
now,
the
tex-o-kan
principle
has
continued
to
be
cited
and
quoted
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
these
8
(a)
(3)
cases,
the
court
here
ended
up
on
page
733
of
the
record
with
the
precise
quote
that
i've
just
read
to
the
court.
now,
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
standard
of
proof
in
an
8
(a)
(3)
case
under
the
statute
is
no
different
from
what
it
is
in
an
8
(a)
(1)
case
or
any
other
unfair
labor
practice
case,
the
statute
says
that
the
board's
finding
of
fact
that
supported
by
substantial
evidence
on
the
record
of
the
whole
shall
be
conclusive.
the
required
direct
contradiction
of
the
employer's
testimony
is
to
the
reason
for
a
discharge
is
virtually
the
equivalent
of
requiring
something
which
is
rarely
obtainable
in
these
cases,
and
direct
evidence
of
a
purpose
to
violate
the
act
in
most
of
these
cases
as
this
illustrated
by
the
record
in
this
case.
you
have
a
set
of
circumstances
which
point
to
a
discriminatory
motive
with
the
discharge.
you
have
a
set
of
circumstances
which
might
have
afforded
could
cost
for
the
discharge.
the
problem
that
the
board
has
is
to
assess
both
sets
of
factors
and
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
which
inference
is
the
stronger
under
the
circumstances.
now,
if
the
board's
inference
is
a
reasonable
one,
taking
into
account
the
entire
record,
we
submit
that
the
reviewing
court
under
the
standard
of
universal
camera
should
sustain
the
board's
findings.
now,
to
require
that
you
have
to
have
direct
contradiction
of
the
reason
assigned
by
the
employer
imposes
a
more
astringent
reviewing
standard
in
8
(a)
(3)
cases
because
it
overlooks
the
fact
that
sometimes
the
employer's
demeanor
may
along
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
rejecting
the
ground
that
he
has
assigned.
secondly,
it
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
board
is
empowered
to
draw
inferences
and
that
even
though
you
may
not
have
direct
contradiction
of
the
employer,
a
set
of
circumstances
may
be
so
strong
in
the
direction
of
discriminatory
motivation
that
the
board
would
be
quite
reasonable
in
drawing
an
inference
on
discriminatory
motivation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor,
i
have
and
i
like
to
address
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
is
quite
true
that
nevada
consolidated
was
cited
in
the
house
conference
report
as
an
instance
of
the
type
of
review
that
congress
wanted
to
change
in
amending
taft-hartley.
however,
there
are
two
parts
about
nevada
consolidated.
it
can
be
looked
at
broadly
as
merely
an
instance
where
the
court
is
looking
to
see
whether
there
is
any
evidence
that
supports
the
board's
conclusion
and
not
looking
at
the
rest
of
the
record
and
resting
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that's
what
universal
put
out
of
business
but
universal
camera
did
not
put
out
of
business
and
indeed,
it
indicated
that
it
definitely
was
leaving
into
business.
the
actual
situation
in
nevada
consolidated
namely
that
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
evidence
in
nevada
consolidated,
you
have
a
set
of
circumstances
that
would
permit
conflicting
inferences.
one
in
favor
of
union
motivation,
one
in
favor
of
cause
and
the
fact
that
the
inferences
--
that
the
circumstances
were
susceptible
of
opposing
inferences
did
not
preclude
the
board
from
concluding
that
the
inference
in
favor
of
union
activity
was
the
basis
for
--
or
was
the
stronger
one.
in
other
words,
nevada
consolidated
dealt
with
the
power
of
the
board
to
draw
inference,
as
universal
camera
indicates
that
congress
could
not
have
met
to
deprive
the
board
of
that
power.
and
in
the
radio
officers
case
subsequent
to
universal
camera,
this
court
347
u.s.
49-50
again
dealt
with
the
argument
that
nevada
consolidated
was
overruled
by
the
amendments
of
the
act
and
it
concluded
that
whatever
congress
said
about
nevada
consolidated,
it
could
not
have
intended
to
overrule
that
part
of
nevada
consolidated
which
says
that
the
power
to
draw
inferences
is
primarily
entrusted
to
the
board
and
that
the
board
is
in
--
is
in
--
that
where
the
inferences
are
susceptible
of
either
interpretation
if
the
board
were
to
conclude
that
the
inference
in
favor
of
union
of
membership
or
activity
was
the
stronger,
the
court
was
not
to
step
in
and
redetermine
it
because
otherwise,
you
would
get
the
court
weighing
the
evidence
and
this
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
your
honor,
i
--
we're
quite
aware
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
however,
in
universal
camera,
this
court
did
leave
itself
power
to
review
in
that
rare
instance
where
the
standard
had
been
grossly
misapplied.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
such
a
case
because
the
court
is
imposing
this
subsidiary
test
of
requiring
that
you
have
direct
contradiction
of
the
reason
assigned
by
the
employer
before
the
board's
contrary
evaluation
of
the
evidence
is
entitled
to
stand.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
your
honor,
i
realize
my
time
is
up.
i
just
like
to
indicate
that
i
think
that
in
our
petition
and
in
our
brief
here,
we
have
gone
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i've
cited
fifth
circuit
cases
where
over
the
period
of
years
which
we
think
reflect
the
erroneous
standard
which
we
think
was
very
clearly
shown
in
--
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
your
honor
i'll
just
refer
you
to
pages
16
and
17
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
which
set
forth
statistics
along
the
line
that
your
honor
has
indicated.
if
i
can
just
intrude
for
a
moment
more,
i
like
to
--
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
we
said
that
--
we
refer
to
a
survey
published
in
the
american
bar
journal
by
frank
cooper
at
--
at
michigan
which
covered
substantial
evidence
cases
over
a
five-year
period
and
he
finds
that
in
the
fifth
circuit,
this
covers
all
the
government
agencies.
of
course
the
board
had
the
lion
share,
sustained
administrative
findings
in
only
45%
of
the
cases
while
the
other
ten
circuits
did
so
in
72%
of
the
cases
that.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
your
--
if
your
honor
will
permit
and
the
court
will,
i
will
try
to
present
some
statistics
along
that
line.
i
have
some.
i'll
just
indicate
that
in
the
fiscal
year
in
1960
for
example.
in
circuits
other
than
the
fifth
circuit,
our
records,
the
board's
record
show
that
we
had
31
cases
substantial
--
these
are
8,
3
substantial
evidence,
fact
cases
circuits
other
than
the
fifth
circuit.
27%
or
87%
were
enforced
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
same
time
we
had
eight
cases
and
two
were
enforced,
are
only
25%.
mr.
norton
j.
come
347
u.s.
was
the
radio
officers
case,
347
u.s.
at
49
to
50.
mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
likewise
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
presents
an
issue
similar
to
that
in
walton,
the
higher
case,
namely
whether
the
court
has
grossly
exceeded
its
reviewing
power
and
setting
aside
for
the
findings
of
fact
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case.
here,
the
board
found
that
the
respondent
unlawfully
refused
to
bargain
with
the
teamsters,
the
certified
bargaining
agent
of
its
employees,
that
this
unfair
labor
practice
was
the
cause
of
a
strike
which
in
ensued
so
that
274
strikers
were
entitled
to
be
returned
to
their
jobs
with
back
pay,
notwithstanding
intervening
replacement,
and
that
respondent
engaged
in
various
acts
of
interference
to
restrain
in
addition
in
the
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
the
court
below
set
aside
the
refusal
to
bargain
findings
which
in
turn
upset
the
finding
that
the
strike
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike
because
in
its
view,
the
trial
examiner's
credibility
determinations
could
not
be
accepted
and
then
it
proceeded
to
reevaluate
and
minimize
the
8
(a)
(1)
act
cavity
and
then
decided
not
even
to
enforce
that
part
of
the
board's
order.
now,
in
walton,
we
attempted
to
show
that
the
court
below
erred
in
rejecting
inferences
drawn
by
the
board
though
on
the
entire
record,
they
had
rational
support.
here,
we
submit,
the
court
has
made
an
even
more
basic
incursion
into
the
board's
fact
finding
function
by
setting
aside
terminations
as
to
the
credibility
of
witnesses
which
were
neither
irrational
nor
contrary
to
the
view
of
the
court
below
based
on
an
improper
standard.
the
facts
can
be
briefly
set
forth
as
follows.
the
union
was
certified
in
february
of
1957,
and
bargaining
negotiations
were
carried
on
sporadically
from
april
through
november,
but
the
parties
were
unable
to
reach
an
agreement.
on
december
4,
union
negotiator,
wingate
and
production
manager,
stephenson,
after
a
private
off
the
record
meeting,
appeared
to
be
not
far
apart
on
the
union's
latest
proposal
and
another
formal
negotiating
session
was
set
for
december
18th.
now,
that
is
a
critical
date
because
the
board
finds
a
refusal
to
bargain
on
and
after
that
date.
at
the
off
the
record
meeting
with
stephenson
on
december
4th,
they
agreed
to
set
up
a
resumed
negotiations
on
december
18th.
on
december
12th
and
13th,
the
florida
citrus
belt
was
hit
by
a
severe
freeze.
at
december
18,
the
meeting
opens
and
union
organizer,
wingate,
asked
for
the
company's
views
on
the
union's
latest
proposals,
which
as
i've
indicated,
appeared
to
be
acceptable
to
stephenson.
the
company
attorney
said
that
there
was
no
point
in
discussing
them
since
they
were
completely
different
from
anything
that
have
ever
been
discussed
up
to
then
and
besides
the
company
wanted
to
talk
about
the
effects
of
the
freeze.
wingate
thereupon
accused
the
company
of
strolling
and
threatened
a
strike.
the
company
representatives
at
that
point
terminated
the
meeting,
indicating
that
they
would
not
respond
to
the
pressure
of
the
strike
and
it
might
do
the
employee
some
good
to
get
it
out
of
their
system.
despite
frequent
requests
by
the
union,
there
was
no
further
meeting
until
january
28,
1958.
the
parties
got
together
after
a
short
meeting
that
broke
up
with
the
company
indicating
that
it
would
get
in
touch
with
the
union
for
further
meetings.
no
further
word
was
received
from
the
company
and
no
future
meeting
was
selected.
in
the
meantime,
a
decertification
petition
was
circulated
in
the
plant.
the
company
allowed
the
employees
to
circulate
it
on
company
time.
majority
of
the
employee
signed
it,
repudiating
the
union.
as
soon
as
the
company
receives
that
they
tell
the
union
that
they
will
no
longer
bargain
with
them
because
the
union
has
lost
its
majority.
now,
the
board
found
that
on
and
after
december
18,
1957,
the
company
refused
to
bargain
in
good
faith
with
the
union.
that
what
it
was
doing
was
exploiting
the
emergency
created
by
the
freeze
in
this
florida
citrus
belt
as
an
excuse
for
delaying
negotiations
while
in
the
meantime,
it
was
carrying
on
a
course
of
conduct
which
i
will
elude
to
later
for
the
purpose
of
undermining
the
support
for
the
union
so
that
when
february
8
came
around
which
was
the
end
of
the
certification
year,
the
company
could
withdraw
recognition
from
the
union.
now,
to
support
this
finding
that
there
was
bad
faith
between
bargaining
and
a
consorted
effort
to
undermine
the
union
on
and
after
december
18th,
1957.
this
finding
is
supported
basically
on
the
testimony
of
the
employee
holly
and
union
organizer,
wingate
whom
the
board
and
the
trial
examiner
credited.
these
credibility
findings,
the
court
below
upset
and
that
is
the
nub
of
this
case.
we
submit
that
that
court
was
unjustified
in
setting
aside
those
credibility
findings.
it
implied,
and
indeed,
in
doing
so,
it
exceeded
its
reviewing
power
under
section
10
(e)
of
the
act
because
they
were
based
on
reasonable
considerations.
they
were
well
within
the
examiner's
province
as
the
presiding
officer
at
the
hearing
and
the
bias
that
the
court
attributed
to
the
examiner
was
based
upon
statements
in
his
intermediate
report
which
we
submit
do
not
reasonably
have
the
significance
that
the
court
attributed
to
them.
now,
as
to
holly,
because
he
is
the
key,
one
of
the
key
witnesses
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
holly
was
the
employee.
he
was
an
old
time
employee
who
had
been
active
in
the
administration
of
the
former
union
which
had
previously
represented
the
employees
before
the
teamsters
came
on
the
scene.
i'll
continue
tomorrow.
mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court.
in
adjournment
yesterday
afternoon,
i
pointed
out
that
the
board
found
that
on
and
after
december
18,
1957,
the
company
had
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union
and
had
engaged
in
other
activity
to
undermine
the
union
and
that
this
--
this
was
all
part
of
a
plan
so
that
when
february
8th
came
around
and
the
union's
certification
year
was
at
an
end,
the
union
would
have
lost
its
majority
support
with
the
company
would
have
a
pre-tax
for
withdrawing
recognition.
now,
crucial
to
that
finding
as
the
court
below
acknowledged
was
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses
whom
the
trial
examiner
and
the
board
credited
and
whom
the
court
below
discredited.
attributing
to
the
examiner,
we
submit
an
erroneous
standard
which
he
did
not
apply.
now,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
two
witnesses.
the
first
witness
was
holly
who,
as
i
indicated
yesterday,
was
an
old
time
employee
who
had
been
active
in
the
administration
of
the
union
that
had
previously
represented
the
employees
before
the
teamsters
had
been
certified.
he
had
active
in
negotiations
on
behalf
of
the
former
union
and
participated
across
the
table
which
stephenson
in
--
in
--
in
numerable
arbitration
proceedings.
he
testified
and
his
testimony
is
in
volume
ii
of
the
record
here
beginning
at
page
24.
and
i
like
to
just
point
out
by
way
of
introductions
since
there
was
a
little
confusion
yesterday
that
the
three
volumes
in
both
of
these
cases
break
down
roughly
this
way.
volume
i
consists
of
the
so-called
formal
materials,
the
board's
decision,
the
trial
examiner's
intermediate
report
volume
ii
is
the
portions
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
that
the
board
designated
in
the
court
below
and
volume
iii
is
the
portions
that
the
respondent
designated
in
court
below
and
then
add
it.
at
the
back
of
that
is
the
decision
of
the
--
of
the
court
below.
now,
holly's
testimony
which
is
set
forth
as
i
indicated
in
the
volume
ii
was
that
--
while
he
was
at
the
plant
on
christmas
day,
he
was
currently
acting
as
a
--
as
a
watchman
at
that
time.
stephenson
came
to
the
plant
to
do
some
work.
and
the
--
and
this
christmas
day
was
shortly
after
the
breakup
of
the
negotiations
on
december
18th.
stephenson
engaged
him
in
--
in
conversation
and
the
--
and
the
gist
of
the
conversation
was
that
the
company
didn't
intend
to
sign
a
contract
with
the
teamsters
although
it
might
meet
with
them
a
time
or
two
more
until
february
6th
because
they
thought
that
the
teamsters
were
a
bunch
of
crooks
and
gangsters
and
they
didn't
intend
to
sign
a
contract
with
them.
he
suggested
that
stephenson
did
that
holly
form
a
group
of
employees
to
express
their
dissatisfaction
with
the
union
and
to
initiate
decertification
proceedings
and
offering
to
make
legal
counsel
available
off
the
record
and
of
the
employees
thought
that
they
still
made
at
the
union
to
assist
them
in
forming
a
company
union.
finally,
stephenson
indicated
according
to
holly's
testimony
that
the
company
would
post
certain
pay
raises
that
is
on
the
bulletin
board
in
the
next
few
weeks
which
would
give
the
employees
an
incentive
to
get
rid
of
the
union.
now,
this
is
holly's
testimony.
stephenson,
whose
testimony
is
likewise
in
volume
ii
of
the
record
beginning
about
page
474,
is
to
discipline.
he
admitted
that
he
had
a
conversation
with
holly
on
christmas
day.
he
admitted
that
the
subjects
of
a
company
union
and
a
proposed
wage
increase
were
discussed.
however,
he
said
that
these
subjects
were
--
were
brought
up
by
--
by
holly
and
not
by
he.
and
he
denied
stating
that
the
company
would
not
sign
a
contract
with
the
teamsters.
he
denied
calling
them
crooks
and
gangsters
saying
that
he
never
used
those
terms.
now,
the
trial
examiner
confronted
with
these
two
conflicting
pieces
of
testimony
credited
holly.
and
his
reasons
for
crediting
holly
are
set
forth
in
volume
i
of
the
record
here
beginning
on
pages
94
to
95.
and
he
gives
a
rather
painstaking
analysis
of
his
reasons
for
crediting
holly
over
stephenson.
in
the
first
place,
he
concludes
that
terms
of
the
demeanor
of
the
respective
witnesses,
holly
demeanor
was
more
impressive.
he
was
firmer
and
direct
and
stood
up
well
on
cross-examination
whereas
stephenson
particularly
on
cross-examination
showed
a
demeanor
and
a
manner
of
reluctance
in
testimony
which
concluded
--
which
led
the
examiner
to
believe
that
holly
was
the
more
reliable
witness.
so
this
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
was
both,
your
honor.
i
think
if
you
read
the
record
you
will
find
the
--
any
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
oh,
i
think
he
was
referring
to
both
things,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
you
would
--
what
you
have
to
do,
you
should
have
to
read
over
the
whole
cross-examination
which
begins
on
486
to
seven.
and
you
will
find
that
in
many
of
these
colloquies
here,
stephenson
reflects
a
great
uncertainty
about
details
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
alright,
well,
i
have
here
marked
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
have
486
to
seven.
they
were
talking
about
a
phone
conversation
that
they
had
from
--
that
wingate
had
--
had
called
about
arranging
a
--
a
meeting
after
the
--
as
i
recalled
yesterday
wingate
and
then
stephenson
had
had
these
man-to-man
meeting
on
december
4th.
and
then
they
left
things
so
that
holly
was
go
--
that
stephenson
was
going
to
arrange
a
--
a
suitable
meeting
date
after
checking
what
the
company
attorney
and
after
wingate
hadn't
--
hadn't
heard
for
several
weeks,
he
--
he
got
in
--
in
touch
with
stephenson
wanting
to
know
what
the
date
was
going
to
be.
apparently,
stephenson
had
made
a
notation.
there
had
been
a
phone
call.
and
you
go
on
here
for
several
pages
but
he's
being
a
very,
very
vague
as
to
--
as
to
what
the
notation
was
and
that
finally
spool
out
at
him
that
this
is
the
--
must
have
been
a
phone
call
that
wingate
had
made
with
reference
to
setting
up
a
meeting
subsequent
to
december
4.
and
as
you
--
as
you
go
on
with
the
--
with
the
cross-examination,
there
are
numerous
other
instances
of
that
sort.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
your
honor
that
they
com
--
that
they
consist
of
about
80%
of
it.
we
have
filed
the
original
transcripts
with
this
court
so
that
the
court
has
the
--
has
the
full
record.
but
what
we've
--
or
the
system
that's
used
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
fifth
circuit
as
in
most
of
the
other
circuits
is
that
the
board
will
designate
the
portions
of
the
transcript
that
it
once
printed
and
the
other
side
will
come
in
with
the
portion
that
it
once
printed
and
then
you
can
read
designate
so
that
by
the
time
your
through
with
it,
you
have
pretty
much
everything
of
the
record
that
is
at
all
relevant
and
that
was
done
here.
i
think
that
when
i
say
80%,
perhaps,
i
was
--
even
a
little
conservative
there.
but
i
think
you
have
virtually
everything
in
this
printed
portion.
but
to
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
the
extent
that
there
was
anything
that
was
not
designated,
that
is
in
the
original
transcript
which
is
up
before
this
court
both
in
this
case
and
also
in
the
walton
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
well,
i
think
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
however
indicates
that
--
that
it's
the
whole
record
in
the
sense
that
the
parties
can
--
it's
the
whole
record
that
the
parties
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
court.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
what
was
called
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
what
we
have
in
these
two
volumes.
and
that
is
--
of
course
we
--
and
that
is,
as
i
indicated,
all
of
the
relevant
testimony
in
the
case.
the
only
thing
that
may
have
not
been
printed
in
here
might
have
been
colloquy
on
things
that
are
not
really
germane.
but
you
have
here
a
very
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
is
you
--
your
honor
in
the
sense
that
we
filed
the
complete
transcript
of
record
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
court's
rule
then
provide
what
the
parties
to
designate
relevant
parts
of
those
--
of
the
record
for
printing.
now,
as
your
honor
can
appreciate
in
an
original
transcript,
you
get
a
lot
of
stuff
in
there
that
is
not
relevant.
i
don't
think
they've
--
there'd
be
any
dispute
about
it.
you
get
a
lot
of
motion
that
is
--
is
wasted.
now,
when
you
have
this
cross
designation
system,
it
is
very
rare
that
with
both
sides
keeping
tabs
on
each
other
that
--
and
with
the
opportunity
for
cross
designation
that
anything
is
going
to
be
left
out
that
either
side
would
think
what
that
all
have
a
remote
bearing
on
the
case.
and
if
by
any
chance,
the
court
should
feel
that
it
wants
more,
it's
got
the
original
transcript
there.
now,
there's
no
suggestion
in
either
in
this
case
or
in
walton
case
that
there
is
anything
in
the
material
that
wasn't
printed
that
has
a
bearing
on
the
issues
that
we
have
here.
and
now
as
to
what
this
court
said
in
universal
camera,
it
said
that
unlike
what
some
courts
may
have
been
doing
in
the
past
namely,
they
looked
only
at
the
volume
that
the
board
printed
and
saw
whether
that
was
enough
to
support
beforehand
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
and
stop
there.
according
universal
camera
says
you
can't
do
that
any
longer.
you
got
to
look
at
the
whole
record,
both
the
portion
that
the
board
designates
and
the
board,
i
might
say,
is
--
tries
to
be
very
careful
to
designate
not
only
the
--
the
part
that
is
relevant
to
its
case
but
any
parts
that
go
to
the
other
case
that
has
been
discredited
or
may
have
a
bearing
on
the
board's
findings
as
we
did
here
because
the
stephenson's
testimony
is
in
the
board's
designation
here.
and
what
universal
camera
says
is
that
the
reviewing
court
has
going
to
look
at
both
of
these
things.
mr.
norton
j.
come
your
honor,
i
--
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
feel
that
they
do
get
the
whole
record
through
this
system
because
all
of
them
do
not
say
that
you
print
up
the
whole
record
before
the
board.
but
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
the
--
the
most
of
the
rules
have
a
special
section
for
review
of
administrative
orders,
for
agencies
like
the
board
and
the
federal
trade
commission
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
then
those
--
that
special
section
for
administrative
agencies
has
this
provision
for
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i've
--
if
--
if
i
may
be
permitted
just
one
further
comment
then
i
don't
want
to
be
insisting
on
the
last
word
but,
this
court
indicated
in
universal
camera,
as
your
honor
is
familiar,
the
standard
of
review
in
--
in
taft-hartley
was
the
same
as
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.you
read
the
two
statutes
together.
now,
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
the
very
same
section
10
that
sets
forth
the
standard
of
review
also
has
a
provision
that
provides
that
on
review,
the
record
show
that
the
court
may
consider
as
the
record
those
portions
that
have
been
designated
by
the
respective
parties.
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
submit
that
reapplying
that
test,
a
fair
reading
of
--
of
the
record
indicates
that
--
and
of
the
court's
reasons
for
rejecting
a
board's
conclusion
that
the
court
was
not
entitled
to
reach
the
judgment
that
it
did.
this
is
not
a
pittsburgh
steamship
type
case.
if
it
were,
we
would
not
be
here.
we've
waited
11
years.
and
we
think
that
these
cases
present
that
rare
instance
that
the
court
talked
about
in
universal
camera.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
black
that
the
result
is
that
--
that
is
what
happens
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
--
of
the
cases.
the
--
put
it
--
most
of
the
--
of
the
circuits,
as
i
indicated
yesterday,
have
had
no
trouble
in
the
--
in
applying
the
universal
camera
principle.
we
don't
win
all
of
our
cases
there
but
--
in
those
other
circuits
but
you
have
nothing
more
than
just
a
difference
of
view
on
a
fair
appraisal
of
the
--
of
the
evidence.
but
what
we
believe
is
here
is
that
the
court
is
doing
more
than
just
differing
what
the
board
on
its
appraisal
of
the
evidence
what
it
is
doing
is
applying
wrong
principles
and
evaluating
the
evidence
in
the
8
(3)
situation,
it
is
setting
forth
this
principle
that
you
cannot
upset
the
reason
assigned
by
the
employer
unless
it's
directly
contradicted.
now,
certainly
that
--
if
that
principle
is
wrong,
this
court
straightens
that
up
presumably
from
thereon
in
there
should
be
no
need
to
have
a
flood
of
cases
from
the
fifth
circuit.
none
of
the
other
circuits
are
adhering
to
that
standard.
and
we
haven't
brought
any
cases
from
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
congress
still
has
left
this
court
with
a
certiorari
power
to
review
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
hasn't
said
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
in
the
cases
that
we
bring
up
to
you,
those
rare
cases
and
as
i
said
this
is
the
--
these
are
the
first
two
in
--
in
11
years.
i
think
that
this
court
has
no
choice
but
--
but
to
--
but
to
reevaluate
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
i'm
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
in
these
two
cases,
the
court
might
find
that
--
that
that
is
necessary.
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
it
--
it
--
it
would
be
necessary.
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
this
--
the
congress
did
not
say
that
this
court
should
relinquish
--
review
over
what
the
courts
of
appeals
are
doing
to
the
extent
of
--
of
--
of
not
ensuring
that
they
are
applying
the
--
the
same
principles
in
evaluating
this
evidence.
now,
if
we
can
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
--
it
is
the
exercise
of
judgment
but
yet
this
court
takes
jury
cases.
i
know
that
there's
dispute
about
that
in
--
in
a
situation
where
they
find
that
the
trial
court
has
applied
the
wrong
principle.
now,
we
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
alright.
the
wrong
principle
in
this
case
is
to
upset
the
trial
examiner's
credibility
determination
on
the
basis
that
he
exhibited
bias
and
prejudice
toward
company
witnesses
on
a
basis
that
just
taking
plea
insubstantial
and
erroneous.
it
is
esse
--
it
is
essentially
the
same
principle
because
this
court
in
pittsburgh
steamship
1,
the
first
pittsburgh
steamship
case
to
take
that
case
from
the
sixth
circuit
and
reverse
when
it
found
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
applying
the
principle
that
just
because
the
trial
examiner
had
credited
all
the
witnesses
on
one
side
and
discredited
on
the
other
side.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
--
i
am,
if
that
is
all
that
they
relied
on
because
i
think
that's
what
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
be
the
last
to
suggest
that
your
honor.
i've
more
than
exhausted
my
time.
thank
you
for
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
the
extension.
