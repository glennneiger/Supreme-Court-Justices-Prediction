justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
said
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
had
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting,
however,
privilege
this
--
let's
put
it,
that
the
fifth
circuit
have
an
stigma
on
this
subject,
there's
a
particular
of
the
0551.
you're
not
suggesting
about
a
series
of
cases
that
this
court
--
the
fifth
circuit,
it
gets
throughout
line
from
all
the
other
circuits
that
there
must
be
something,
something
that
matters,
some
ingredient
let's
say
infuses
to
their
judgment
or
some
ingredient
to
be
found
either
appropriate,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
what
are
you
saying?
or
are
you
suggesting
that
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
court
will
practice
under
good
faith.
the
department
has
examind,
the
board
has
examined
that
(inaudible).
but
to
me,
it
takes
a
lot
of
efforts
but
i
should
direct
myself
to
the
general
asset
(inaudible)
one
thing
or
another
(inaudible)
by
this
board
or
in
the
particular
case,
the
board's
view
that
they
have
(inaudible)
this
is
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i've
been
looking
for
and
that
is
on
the,
i
think,
on
the
outset
for
(inaudible)
a
decision
which
demonstrate
from
which
one
can
fairly
draw
as
an
inquiry.
i
get
to
find
that
the
board
in
nature
that
every
once
in
a
while
they
refer
from
other
case.
it
goes
on
to
hold
that
this
follow
the
universal
camera
that
merely
because
of
the
problem
of
the
board
of
the
different
abuse
from
the
conclusion
reach
by
court
of
appeals
has
no
justification
for
coming
here
because
that's
draw
the
courts
of
appeal
under
our
common
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
we
did
on
to
your
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
have
--
in
order
to
get
certificate,
you
must
show
(voice
overlap)
that
come
before
the
court,
one
would
might
get
the
impression
that
many
come
before
that
court
as
compared
with
first
circuit,
the
one
i
am
thinking
about
or
some
other
circuit,
so
(inaudible)
significance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
--
how
many
judges
are
there
in
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
what
you're
saying
the
tendency
that
you
imply
or
is
it
to
abolish
camera,
was
there
a
difference?
do
your
--
do
your
legislation
show
the
difference
as
to
who
is
(inaudible)
or
is
this
a
--
was
this
an
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
surely
is
phenomenal,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
come,
i
notice
you
rely
on
regard
of
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
taken
into
account
that
the
universal
camera
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
was
not
to
be
cited
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
universal
camera
put
out
of
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
same
day
that
universal
camera
was
decided
(inaudible)
was
the
pittsburgh
steamship
company
was
decided
and
that
sustained
or
concluded
that
the
court
--
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
really
indicates
that
if
one
were
to
view
this
independently,
one
would
have
reached
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
it
should
not
qualify
what
is
found
in
universal
camera
and
that
did
not
preclude
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
examination
of
the
whole
record
from
drawing
an
inference
that
we
may
not
draw
that
drawing
inference
is
different
from
which
the
board,
the
labor
board's
ruling.
and
i
notice
throughout
the
government
in
its
brief,
all
it
comes
about
universal
camera
never
talks
about
the
necessary
incompetence
of
universal
camera
and
pittsburgh
steamship
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
at
the
same
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
there
is
the
largest
of
leeway
given
to
the
courts
of
appeals
and
on
the
whole
cases
ought
to
come
here.
that
was
the
burden
of
pittsburgh
steamship
company.
if
on
all
of
these
records,
the
reviewing
board
couldn't
say
on
the
whole,
we
think,
the
rest
of
the
record
or
the
totality
of
the
record
overbears
the
(inaudible)
of
the
board
which
is
a
very
different
thing
from
saying,
they
could
--
that's
de
novo.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
the
case
--
the
case
like
this
could
come
here
on
the
--
on
the
decision
of
the
government,
not
that
this
particular
case
or
that
particular
case
is
brought.
it's
brought
on
specific
judgment,
upon
those
judgments
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
to
come
here
in
and
prepare
to
show
that
the
conduct
being
shown
that
in
fact
the
fifth
circuit
or
the
ninth
circuit
has
a
wrong
sense
of
mind
in
these
cases.
it's
not
just
making
a
judgment
which
the
board
could
defense
in
this
court
its
decree.
now,
that's
the
the
burden
of
pittsburgh
steamship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
according
to
the
board
must
--
ought
to
be
(inaudible)
things
are
not
one
of
those
(inaudible)
judicial
questions
decided
by
(inaudible)
of
the
various
courts
of
appeals
which
have
numerated
reviewed
labor
board
cases
over
period
of
five
years,
(inaudible)
ought
to
be
reversals
or
affirmances
or
possible
affirmances
or
possible
reversal
in
relation
to
the
quality
of
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
doesn't
--
unless
you
break
that
down
and
tell
me
how
many
cases
there
are
in
the
fourth
--
first
circuit.
there
may
be
three
cases
in
the
first
circuit
that
might
get
a
100%
affirmance.
that
doesn't
show
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
as
you
recall
a
testimony
of
the
worker
as
to
whom
mr.
come
referred
the
evidence
of
the
basis,
this
the
findings
the
board
with
reference
here,
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
findings.
certainly,
the
evidence
on
which
the
board
based
concerning
the
reason
given,
the
considerations
of
evidence
by
both
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
examiner
reported.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
he
examine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
me
because
i
have
another
volume?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
who's
the
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
was
a
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
examined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
he
tell
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
evidence
you
say,
you
said
(inaudible)
that
there's
no
evidence
that
the
--
there's
no
evidence
that
the
management
suppose
that
any
of
the
employers
--
any
employers
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
examination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
she
discharge
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
another
one,
there's
a
different
question,
testimony
he
gave
is
what
--
what
testimony
there
was,
(inaudible),
all
the
testimony
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
before
the
examiner
on
the
day
(inaudible)
because
of
her
union
activities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
line
of
evidence
is
not
in
what
the
employer
said
or
were
there
worksheets?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
there
any
suggestion,
you
used
the
word
adaption?
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
must
be
generally
reported,
was
the
board
found
and
then
to
what
the
court
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
basis
of
records
that
came
to
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thompson,
was
there
any
evidence
on
this
record
--
was
there
any
evidence
by
the
board
that
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
talk
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
was
there
intention
for
the
specific
instances
that
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
show?
worksheets
really
don't
show
anything
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
whose
to
decide
whether
they're
germane
or
not?
perfectly
careful
conscientious
and
perhaps
equally
highly
trained
lawyers
constantly
differs
to
what
is
germane
and
what
isn't
germane?
one
can
sit
in
this
court
in
a
week
or
two
days
without
realizing
differences
of
use
even
among
the
justices
on
what
they
deem
as
relevant.
and
when
you
say
colloquy,
a
colloquy
may
shed
a
lot
of
light
on
a
man's
insight.
a
remark
by
--
by
the
examiner
in
--
in
colloquy
of
your
counsel
may
--
may
or
may
not
justify
the
court
of
appeals
in
finding
a
particular
bench
into
the
examiner's
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
point
about
the
amendment
of
1947
was
that
justice
black
has
just
indicated
that
the
totally
of
everything
that
was
before
the
board
should
be
before
the
reviewing
of
courts
--
of
the
court
--
three
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
comes
what's
this
court,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
it
said.
it
stated
it
has
to
look
at
the
whole
record
that
was
before
the
board.
this
isn't
a
question
--
mr.
come,
this
isn't
a
question
of
anybody's
good
faith,
the
conscientiousness.
the
question
of
judgment
and
anybody
who's
ever
had
to
get
up
a
bill
of
exceptions
in
the
old
days
must
have
experienced,
must
have
realized
the
extent
to
which
men
looking
at
relevance
to
their
special
particular
glasses
would
have
very
different
views
of
what
you
think
is
fully
irrelevant.
and
if
you
only
print
a
part,
there
is
such
a
thing
as
mo
--
the
momentum
of
laziness
in
all
of
us.
and
--
and
very
few
of
us
attempted
to
go
beyond
three
facts
or
two
--
one
fact
and
two
more
or
less
ample
printed
record
and
go
to
the
tedious
and
difficult
reading
of
the
typewritten
copy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
rules
--
the
rule
to
which
you
referred,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
a
rule
with
reference
to
this
particular
classification
but
a
rule
generally
as
to
how
the
appeal
broke
or
whatever
you
call
it,
the
record
should
be
made
up
in
the
court
of
appeals,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
think
that
--
if
that
is
so,
then
with
all
due
respect,
they
make
in
laws
on
what
was
the
official
problem
after
the
amendment
which
was
re
--
which
was
applied
in
universal
camera.
because
this
court
from
--
from
the
time
certainly
this
--
the
older
fellows
that
sat
here
had
a
totally
different
conception
of
what
the
scope
of
review
in
these
cases
were
--
was
until
the
act
of
1947.
and
case
after
case
went
on
the
simple
question
of
seeing
what
was
before
the
board
on
one
side
and
meant
--
and
possible
that
was
in
now.
and
that's
why
--
and
then
came
the
amendment
in
which
the
both
committees
of
congress
pointed
out
that
this
court
rendered
decisions
that
the
congress
did
not
plan
in
the
future
to
have
rendered.
and
they
specify
including
the
one
that
you
relied
on
yesterday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
in
the
taft-hartley
act.
and
universal
camera
drew
light
from
the
administrative
procedure
act
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
general
scope
of
review
but
the
taft-hartley
act
is
a
specific
act
not
qualified
or
limited
by
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
you
leave
onto
account,
if
i
may
say
so.
this
is
a
very
difficult
problem,
and
i'm
sure
it
is
for
my
brother
on
the
court,
this
is
a
very
difficult
problem
since
the
taft-hartley
act
made
the
amendment
whereby
the
congress
decided
to
vest
the
courts
of
appeals
with
a
far
greater
duty
than
they
before
had
been
imposed
upon
them
namely,
that
they
should
go
through
the
whole
record
which
meant
not
merely
say,
as
one
witness
say
one
thing
and
another
witness
say
another
thing,
therefore,
the
board
is
free
to
choose
a
rather
than
b
or
take
the
whole
record
and
make
a
judgment,
a
judgment
on
the
totality
of
the
record.
and
then
what
comes
before
us,
as
i
see
it,
what
comes
before
this
court
is
not
determine
whether
the
board
was
justified
in
reaching
the
conclusion
that
it
did
but
whether
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
here
for
review
the
judgment
of
a
court
of
appeals,
was
the
court
of
appeals
justified
or
unjustified
as
to
its
scrutiny
of
the
entire
record,
likewise
on
the
record
which
is
all
that
the
board
had
before
it,
not
the
living
witnesses,
was
the
court
of
appeals
justify
in
drawing
these
inferences
so
that
we
are
not
called
upon
to
say
yes,
the
board
was
entitled
to
reach
this
conclusion
but
was
the
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
disentitled
to
reach
its
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
if
the
wrong
principle
in
this
case
state
the
wrong
principle
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
today
if
we
had
a
record
in
which
this
--
the
court
of
appeals
finds
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
trial
examiner
discredited
all
the
employer's
testimo
--
witnesses
and
credited
all
the
employee
--
all
the
union's
witnesses,
that
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
--
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
say
it
couldn't
find,
if
it
found
that
situation,
disbelieving
all
the
witnesses
on
one
side
and
believing
all
the
witnesses
on
the
other
that
it
couldn't
draw
the
inference
of
a
certain
bias
on
the
examiner?
are
you
laying
down
that
as
a
proposition
of
law
that
an
exa
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
couldn't
make
such
a
finding
and
that
we
have
to
reverse
it
today?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
all
depends
that
--
but
a
--
a
--
a
court
used
this
in
the
case
where
we
have
like
the
fela
cases
or
negligence
cases
where
this
court
is
called
upon
to
decide
whether
enough
was
left
to
a
jury
for
the
jury
to
enable
it
define
to
a
breach
of
contra
verdict,
this
is
a
situation
where
five
members
of
the
board
--
there
are
five
of
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
five
men
reading
a
document
--
reading
this
volume,
each
one
concluding
and
the
congress
of
the
untied
states
says
their
conclusion
on
the
reading
of
this
record
should
be
reviewed
by
three
other
men.
it's
a
very
different
thing.
of
--
of
course,
if
the
jury
question
in
the
sense
that
you
--
to
evaluate
facts
but
it's
a
very
--
it
isn't
a
question
of
--
of
the
time
of
constitutional
deposit
of
power
in
a
jury
whose
verdict
must
be
final
and
not
reviewable
or
not
to
set
aside
if
there's
enough
for
--
enough
evidence
to
go
there.
this
is
five
men
reading
dead
print
and
then
three
men
--
three
judges
called
upon
to
reconsider
the
--
the
judgment
they
formed
on
the
dead
print.
and
i
cannot
see
that
you
can
say
as
a
matter
of
law
of
court
of
appeals
under
the
new
dispensation
isn't
allowed
to
say
it
is
our
conscientious
judgment
that
if
examiner
finds
all
the
witnesses
on
one
side
credible
and
all
the
witnesses
on
the
other
side
incredible
that
on
their
reading
of
the
print,
they
couldn't
have
come
to
a
different
conclusion
than
the
board.
if
that's
the
principle
of
law
then
i
don't
understand
what
principles
of
law
which
may
well
be
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
shedding
a
little
light
to
one
theory
as
(voice
