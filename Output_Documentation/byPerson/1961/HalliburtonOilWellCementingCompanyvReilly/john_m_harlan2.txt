justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
use
tax
apply
only
to
one
who
has
purchased
outside
of
louisiana?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
brings
it
into
the
state
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
uses
it
there.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
taylor,
does
it
bill
this
equipment
from
the
ground
up
itself
or
does
it
purchase
something?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
and
as
to
recognize,
it
is
a
very
frank
statement
of
beliefs.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
your
sales
point,
i
take
it
is
a
supplemental
point
--
it's
the
alternative
point
to
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
and
this
particular
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
going
out
of
business.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
halliburton
which
is
qualified
as
i
understand
it,
domesticated
in
louisiana,
does
it
pay
other
taxes,
excess
taxes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
pays
--
this
is
the
only
tax
he
pays?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
pays
a
full
(inaudible)
of
taxes
that
are
applicable
to
a
domesticated
corporation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you're
different
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
from
the
taxes
that
they're
paid
by
a
domestic
corporation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
when
you
say
in
relation
to
the
whole
tax
structure,
you
--
i
don't
see
where
that
--
and
that
is
your
argument,
i
assume.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you're
not
relying
on
that
tax.
justice
john
m.
harlan
really
the
nub
of
the
issue
between
you
two
gentlemen
is
what
you
compare.
you
say
that
the
out-of-state
use
tax
to
be
compared
dealt
with
the
sales
tax
would
be
applicable
if
the
out-of-state
user
actually
sells,
that
are
doing
what
halliburton
did.
and
they
--
your
opponent
says
that
that
isn't
a
fair
comparison
in
order
to
be
compared
with
the
intrastate
use
taxpayer
who
is
circumstanced
as
halliburton
is
with
reference
to
the
non-sale
of
the
use
of
this
material.
isn't
that
the
difference
between
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
the
result
of
the
way
the
statute
is
written
or
is
the
result
of
the
way
the
stat
--
the
statute
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
court
construed
it
as
being
required
by
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
long
has
this
statute
in
the
books?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
the
first
time
the
statute
has
been
construed
on
this
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
(inaudible)
to
the
sales

in
your
