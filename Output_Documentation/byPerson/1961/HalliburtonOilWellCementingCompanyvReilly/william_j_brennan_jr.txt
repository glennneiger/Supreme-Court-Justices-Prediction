the
labor
and
shop
overhead
actually
applied
however
in
oklahoma?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
what
comes
into
louisiana
is
this
completed
truck
that
we
see
here
at
page
16,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
you
do
is
buy
the
components.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
you
assemble
them
in
oklahoma.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
--
in
figuring
your
cost,
you
include
not
or
you
rather
--
you
add
to
the
cost
of
the
tangible
items,
the
labor
and
overhead
that
goes
into
the
assembling
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
because
halliburton,
by
accident,
had
its
shops
in
oklahoma
rather
than
louisiana.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
multi-state
operation
would
still
be
a
multi-state
operation
i
think.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
might
still
be
a
multi-state
operation
but
had
you
had
your
shops
in
louisiana,
you
can
take
one-third
of
the
tax
youâ€™re
required
not
applied
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
oklahoma.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
--
are
you
saying
then
that
you
don't
question
that
louisiana
made
for
purposes
of
classification
setup
a
classification
of
manufacturer-user
but
that
within
that
classification,
it
may
not
discriminate
between
the
out-of-state
manufacturer-user
and
the
intrastate
manufacturer-user?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
a
classification
of
vendors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
a
classification
you
suggest
of
manufacturer-user?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
like
a
plumber
who
brings
his
equipment
to
do
a
certain
job
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
isn't
your
justification,
is
it?
or
let
me
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
there's
another
one.
i
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
may
i
ask,
obviously
your
sales
tax
does
not
reach
labor
and
overhead,
does
it?
i
mean
labor
and
overhead
as
such
are
not
subject
to
a
sales
tax.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
--
subject
to
a
sales
tax
is
tangible
property
in
the
case
of
a
sale
when
bought
by
a
louisianan
from
outside
the
state,
he
pays
a
--
on
the
sales
price
and
the
purchase
price
to
him
which
ever
the
--
but
he
has
to
pay
for
it.
that
is
the
measurements
of
the
value
against
--
it
was
the
2%
as
applied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
then
when
he
walks
into
the
state
with
something
already
assembled
which
he's
going
to
use
there.
i
understood
your
justification
is
you're
applying
the
2%
for
the
reasonable
value
of
that
property
when
he
brings
it
into
the
state
and
uses
it
there.
and
you
say
that's
the
same
thing
and
there's
no
discrimination
that
even
though
the
dollar
result
are
maybe
as
justice
frankfurter
has
said
different.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
justification
is
not
that
the
local
fellow
has
to
pay
other
taxes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
a
matter
fact
the
--
what
is
halliburton's
status.
i
don't
know
if
its
qualified
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
a
resident
for
purposes
of
your
--
for
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
isn't
your
justification
either.
you're
not
justifying
that
is
a
domesticated
corporation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what's
the
relevance
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
sanford,
suppose
you
had
--
in
this
case,
halliburton
brought
in
two
identical
pieces
of
equipment,
one
to
sell,
the
other
to
use.
they're
identical
pieces,
say
made
--
put
together
in
oklahoma
by
halliburton.
it
sells
one
of
them,
to
measure
the
tax
i
gather
from
what
you
have
said
the
case
of
the
machine
sold,
it'd
be
2%
of
the
sales
price,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
on
the
use
of
the
other
identical
piece,
would
the
measure
of
value
of
the
piece
used
be
the
sales
price
of
the
other
piece?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
the
case
--
the
statute
has
been
enforced
during
the
mid-30s?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
taxes
have
been
paid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
pay
it
prior
to
1955?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
pay
it
prior
to
1955?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
said
prior,
but
1956
is
over.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
just
this,
did
you
say
earlier
there
is
an
oklahoma
tax
comparable
to
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
pay
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
but
if
it
had
--
as
i
understand
it,
if
oklahoma
had
taxed
you,
you
would've
been
entitled
to
a
credit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
amount
of
the
oklahoma
tax,
did
you
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it,
these
knots
and
bolts
(inaudible)
the
value
is
affected
on
both
labor
and
overhead,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
gather
with
these
elements
is
that
for
the
louisiana
manufacturer,
the
instance
--
in
fact
it's
going
to
be
used
or
they're
going
to
use
it
of
the
knots
and
bolts
that
he
puts
together
and
he
pays
the
tax
on
those
before
he
puts
them
together
onto
this
truck,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
rather
the
outside
manufacturer
comes
in
with
the
job
order
complete
and
the
value
of
that
thing
is
completed
when
he
first
used
it,
that
he
was
thus
taxable
for.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
