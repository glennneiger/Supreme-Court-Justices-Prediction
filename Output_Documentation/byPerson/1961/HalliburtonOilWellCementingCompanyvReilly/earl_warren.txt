well
cementing
company,
appellant,
versus
james
s.
reily,
collector
of
revenue,
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
taylor,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
taylor,
one
thing
that's
bothering
me
is
this,
suppose
there
were
two
manufacturing
plants
in
this
city
of
--
in
oklahoma
and
one
of
them
was
yours
where
you
manufactured
this
equipment.
next
to
you
is
another
one
that
--
another
plant
and
that
manufactured
them
for
sale
and
you
brought
them
--
brought
them
into
the
state,
they,
one
of
theirs,
you,
one
of
yours
on
the
same
car,
let's
say
in
railroad
car
and
you
got
to
the
--
you
got
to
the
louisiana
line.
and
you
insisted
that
you
only
be
charged
for
the
materials,
the
tax
on
the
materials
that
are
involved
and
that
the
other
should
be
taxed
on
both
materials
and
labor
and
in
shop
equipment
merely
because
they're
going
to
sell
in
interstate
commerce.
would
there
not
be
--
or
would
there
be,
let
me
say
a
discrimination
as
against
the
other
party?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sanford.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sanford,
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
that
this
use
tax,
the
incidence
of
it
is
the
moment
it
comes
into
your
state
and
is
available
for
use?
and
that
at
that
time,
you
have
no
concern
over
where
it
was
manufactured
or
how
it
was
manufactured,
or
how
it
was
acquired,
or
whether
it
was
acquired
cheaply
or
whether
it
was
acquired
expensively,
do
you
put
the
tax
on
the
actual
value
of
the
commodity,
whatever
it
is
as
it
comes
in
to
your
state.
and
that
you
would
do
the
same
thing
--
you
do
exactly
the
same
thing
for
any
product
that
is
sold
under
your
sales
tax?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
am
--
i
suppose
then
if
the
petitioner
was
to
prevail,
this
would
apply
not
only
to
a
situation
like
his,
but
would
apply
to
thousands
of
items
in
your
state.
and
i
wonder
if
it
would
apply
to
situation
like
this
if
a
person
had
an
old
automobile
and
he
sent
to
detroit
for
an
engine,
to
replace
the
engine
that
was
is
in
it
and
he
brought
it
in
there
to
louisiana.
he
would
have
to
pay
on
the
actual
value
of
that
engine
which
would
include
labor
and
shop
overhead
and
every
thing
else
where
if
he
built
the
same
thing
in
louisiana,
he
wouldn't
have
to
pay
for
any
sales
tax
except
on
the
parts
that
go
into
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
almost
anything.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
this
isn't
really
as
peculiar
a
situation
as
one
might
think?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
a
major
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
contractor
who
--
a
major
contractor
who
comes
in
to
do
a
big
job,
he
brings
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
his
own
equipment
in
and
uses
them
there,
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sanford
may
i
ask
you
this,
another
simple
transaction.
we
have
thousands
of
youngsters
who
make
radios
these
days,
and
they
buy
all
the
parts
separately
and
put
them
together
and
get
a
good
radio.
now,
let's
say
that
a
youngster
does
that
and
makes
one
that
--
makes
a
radio
that
is
exactly
comparable
to
one
that
is
sold
in
the
stores
of
louisiana.
i'm
talking
about
the
louisiana
boy
in
louisiana.
now,
he
--
if
he
buys
one
of
those
in
the
store,
he
has
to
pay
just
as
you
have
charged
halliburton
here,
for
everything
that
goes
into
the
cost
price
of
that
radio,
does
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
including
the
profit
that
the
man
at
the
store
makes.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
goes
to
a
hardware
store
and
buys
each
one
of
those
parts
separately
and
puts
them
together
himself
and
makes
his
own
radio,
then
he
has
to
pay
the
2%
tax
on
every
item
that
goes
into
that
thing.
but
that
you
--
it
is
no
longer
--
it
isn't
the
sales
tax
when
he
puts
them
together
so
you
don't
charge
him
for
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
already
have
paid
for
everything
that
was
sold
to
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
whether
he's
in
interstate
commerce
or
intrastate
commerce,
not
a
louisiana
citizen
or
otherwise.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
correct.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this
mr.
sanford?
if
two
persons
were
bringing
in
the
same
commodity,
one
of
them
bought
from
a
manufacturer
and
the
other
one
bought
from
--
at
a
bankruptcy
sale
let
us
say,
and
the
prices
were
very
considerably
different
and
they
came
to
the
border
at
the
same
time,
would
you
make
a
difference
between
the
value
of
those
two
things
if
they
are
identical
for
tax
purposes
or
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
the
only
the
reason
i
asked
you
was
this,
as
to
whether
you
treat
what
a
man
paid
for
it
out
of
the
state
as
the
--
as
conclusive
on
the
value
in
louisiana
or
whether
you
yourself
judged
the
value
of
it
and
only
use
cost
as
evidence
of
value.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
never
have
done
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
taylor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
should
that
make
any
difference
in
the
decision
of
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
versus
james
s.
reily,
collector
of
revenue,
state
of
louisiana.
the
orders
--
the
other
orders
of
the
court
are
cert
--
have
been
certified
by
the
chief
justice
and
filed
with
the
clerk
and
will
not
be
orally
announced.
now,
mr.
taylor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sanford.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sanford,
would
you
please
take
the
hypothetical
case
of
mr.
taylor
about
the
boats
that
are
built,
one
of
them
on
one
side
of
the
little
narrow
stream
that
divides
the
two
states
and
the
other
built
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
and
in
one
instance
as
he
says,
your
tax
is
only
on
the
materials
but
if
he
ships
the
boat
--
the
other
boat
across
the
river
then
it
becomes
liable
for
both
the
value
of
the
materials
plus
the
cost
of
labor
and
overhead.
would
you
give
your
theory
please
as
to
why
that
is
not
--
would
not
be
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
was
that,
i
didn't
quite
understand
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
had
it
on
both
sides?
did
someone
do
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
tax
would
it
bear?
would
it
bear
the
same
kind
of
tax
as
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
all
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
kind
of
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
got
to
pay
a
road
tax?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
if
this
material
that
we're
discussing
in
this
particular
case
were
manufactured
in
louisiana,
would
he
have
been
obliged?
would
halliburton
have
been
obliged
to
pay
a
2%
tax
on
all
the
material
--
on
all
the
labor
and
overhead?
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
the
labor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
about
--
what's
the
difference
between
the
boat
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
employs
--
he
employs
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
people
to
do
it
for
him.
he
pays
for
the
labor.
and
that
is
only
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whether
he
employs
labor
to
build
this
big
truck.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
where
he
employs
labor
and
employs
people
for
overhead.
would
he
have
--
would
there
be
any
such
tax
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
sanford,
let's
get
back
to
the
--
to
his
boat,
the
boat
situation.
if
it
was
built
on
the
louisiana
side,
there
would
be
no
tax
on
either
the
labor
or
materials,
would
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
he
shoved
his
boat
across
the
river
as
he
suggested,
would
your
collector
charge
him
or
assess
him
a
tax
on
his
labor
and
materials,
i
mean
on
his
labor
and
overhead?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
don't
you
do
it
in
louisiana?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
just
so,
would
it,
if
it
was
manufactured
in
louisiana?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
isn't
it
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
if
you
put
the
incidents
of
--
if
you
have
two
articles,
one
in
louisiana
and
one
in
another
state
that
are
constructed
in
exactly
the
same
way
and
in
the
same
kind
of
commerce
if
you
put
the
incidents
of
the
tax
at
one
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
louisiana
and
another
point,
if
it
comes
from
the
outside,
and
you
burden
--
and
you
make
the
tax
excess
if
it's
the
outside
or
wouldn't
that
be
a
burden
on
commerce?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
is
willing
to
pay
you
the
tax
--
pay
you
the
tax
on
the
materials
in
exactly
the
way
that
you
tax
your
own
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
--
you
mean
if
he
makes
a
hundred
trucks
in
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
and
used
one
in
louisiana,
he
ought
to
pay
a
tax
on
all
the
materials
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
a
hundred?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
would
he,
in
this
situation,
would
he
not
if
he
brought
all
the
trucks
in
to
louisiana?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
--
may
i
ask
you,
if
the
thing
is
manufactured
in
louisiana,
do
you
charge
for
the
knots
and
the
bolts
and
the
various
other
materials
that
are
in
it
or
do
you
charge
the
tax
on
the
completed
article
as
of
its
value
when
it's
ready
for
use?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
you
do
put
the
tax
on.
it's
a
--
it's
not
all
maybe
at
the
same
time
but
you
do
put
a
tax
on
those
things
but
when
the
article
is
completed
in
louisiana
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
put
any
other
tax
which
would
include
the
tax
on
the
labor
and
the
overhead
that
goes
in
to
making
a
completed
product.
