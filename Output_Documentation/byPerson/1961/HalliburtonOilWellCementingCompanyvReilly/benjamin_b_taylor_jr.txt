mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
presents
an
important
point
of
constitutional
law
upon
a
brief
statement
of
facts
which
had
been
stipulated.
this
is
a
suit
for
refund
of
tax
monies
paid
under
protest
to
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
case
arises
in
the
field
of
state
taxation
of
interstate
commerce
and
the
governing
principle
of
law
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
interstate
commerce
clause
forbids
tax
discrimination
by
the
states
for
the
forthright
or
ingenious.
that
the
equal
protection
of
the
law’s
clause,
that
the
due
process
clause
forbids
arbitrary
tax
discrimination
by
the
states
even
where
there
is
no
element
of
interstate
commerce.
the
classification
for
tax
purposes
may
not
be
probably
arbitrary.
now,
the
louisiana
collector
of
revenue,
as
we
see
it,
takes
the
position
that
louisiana
may
levy
an
excise
tax
upon
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
upheld
the
collector
of
revenue
and
as
we
view
that
decision
has
held
that
louisiana
may
discriminate
against
the
multistate
or
interstate
business
that
louisiana
may
thus
give
a
direct
commercial
advantage
to
local
business.
halliburton
oil
well
cementing
company
of
duncan,
oklahoma,
appellant
taxpayer,
has
appealed
from
this
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
on
the
ground
that
it
is
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
particularly
to
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
clause
and
the
due
process
clause.
this
court
has
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
the
tax
in
question
is
the
louisiana
use
tax
which
as
a
part
of
the
louisiana
sales
and
use
tax
law.
the
tax
rate
is
2%.
in
the
case
of
the
sales
tax,
the
intrastate
tax,
the
rate
is
2%
of
the
sales
tax
--
of
the
sales
price
to
the
purchaser.
in
the
case
of
the
use
tax,
the
rate
is
2%
of
the
cost
price
to
the
purchaser
who
imports
the
goods,
that
is
the
purchaser
who
has
purchased
the
goods
outside
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
brought
them
into
the
state
for
his
own
use.
halliburton's
complaint
is
not
of
the
2%
tax
rate
which
is
the
same
in
both
taxes.
halliburton's
complaint
is
of
discrimination
in
the
choice
of
tax
basis
to
which
the
2%
rate
is
applied.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor,
then
brings
it
into
the
state
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
--
and
uses
it
there.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
of
the
henneford
case
--
henneford
versus
silas
mason
is
the
key
case
of
which
is
cited,
reported
and
relied
upon
by
both
sides.
actually,
that
is
the
only
case
at
issued
here
today.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
the
use
tax
sir
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
if
falls
upon,
“the
first
use
--"
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
"the
first
use
within
the
statute”
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
no,
that
should
--
it
would
not
go
that
far
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
well,
here’s
what
it
says
to
section
302.
here
is
the
sales
tax
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
this
is
from
page
80
of
the
larger
yellow
brief
where
we
have
quoted
the
statute
as
a
supplement
at
page
8.
section
302,
at
the
top
of
the
(a)
there
right
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
fixes
the
sales
tax
upon
the
sale.
now
section
302
(a)
(2)
almost
at
the
bottom
of
page
80
has
this
language.
here’s
the
fixing
of
the
tax.
at
the
rate
of
2%
of
the
cost
price
of
each
item
or
article
of
tangible
personal
property,
when
the
same
is
not
sold
but
used,
consumed,
distributed
or
stored
for
use
or
consumption
in
the
state.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
there
would
--
that
be
solely
sir
because
there’s
exemption
for
food,
but
otherwise
(voice
overlap)
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that
would
be
a
use
tax
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
there’s
a
using
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
use
tax,
historically,
the
sales
tax
has
preceded
the
use
taxes
and
it
was
found
that
people
would
go
outside
the
state
for
their
major
purchases,
and
so
the
use
taxes
were
put
in
to
cover
that
gap.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
it
would
be
stored
for
use
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
correct.
now
we
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
now,
as
this
court
may
judicially
notice,
the
sales
and
use
taxes
have
become
important
taxes,
37
american
states
levy
such
taxes
and
they
account
for
20%
of
the
combined
total
tax
take
of
all
states.
an
important
question
of
constitutional
law
is
presented
today,
substantial
tax
monies
are
at
stake
and
seven
interstate
taxpayers
have
filed
the
briefs,
amicus
curiae,
on
the
jurisdictional
statement,
among
them
humble
oil
and
refining
company,
chicago
bridge
and
iron,
sperry
rand
and
american
can.
let
us
focus
now
upon
the
heart
of
this
controversy.
the
louisiana
sales
tax,
as
distinguished
from
the
use
tax,
falls
only
upon
intrastate
sales.
the
use
tax
on
the
other
hand,
falls
only
upon
the
use
within
the
state,
of
goods
acquired
outside
the
state
and
then
imported
into
the
state
and
used
within
the
state.
so
the
sales
tax
is
an
intrastate
tax
and
the
use
tax
is
an
interstate
tax,
the
interstate
counterpart
of
the
intrastate
sales
tax.
in
the
silas
mason
case
to
which
reference
has
been
made
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
halliburton
oil
well
cementing
company
is
manufacturer
which
uses
its
own
wet
product.
an
economist
would
classify
it
as
a
manufacturer-user
or
producer-consumer.
halliburton
is
not
engaged
in
buying
or
selling
the
equipment
here
in
question
so
as
to
give
rise
to
the
sales
tax.
halliburton’s
operation
is
this,
halliburton
manufactures
complex
truck-borne
scientific
equipment,
specialized
oil
well
servicing
equipment
for
cementing,
logging,
testing,
surveying
and
perforated
center
for
oil
wells.
this
equipment
is
produced
and
fabricated
in
halliburton’s
own
production
shops
in
duncan,
oklahoma.
we
have
found
it
helpful
to
visualize
this
equipment
and
photographs
of
this
equipment
appear
in
the
transcript
of
record,
opposite
page
16.
halliburton
conducts
a
multi-state
operation,
interstate
operation
partially
within
louisiana
and
partially
outside
louisiana.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir.
it
conducts
its
operations
in
three
steps.
first,
the
manufacturing
in
its
own
shops
in
duncan,
oklahoma
of
this
complex
equipment,
the
next
step
is
a
transportation
of
this
equipment
in
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
on
interstate
highways
across
state
lines
and
the
importation
of
this
equipment
into
louisiana.
the
third
step
is
the
using
of
this
product
in
louisiana
on
the
contract
for
the
purpose
of
servicing
oil
wells.
halliburton
does
not
sell
this
equipment
but
uses
it
on
the
contract
in
louisiana.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
it
purchase
certain
major
parts
such
as
the
chassis
and
major
pieces
of
scientific
equipment
but
it
is
of
the
--
it
is
of
the
essence
of
this
case
sir,
that
approximately
two-thirds
of
the
cost
of
this
--
this
finished
equipment
--
two-thirds
of
it
was
in
labor
and
shop
overhead.
that
you
have
focused
upon
the
key
point
on
the
case
that
one-third
of
the
finished
cost
price
was
materials
which
we
call
cost
element
(voice
overlap)
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
in
oklahoma
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
right.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
actually
in
--
yes,
a
little
over
two-thirds.
actually,
for
the
tax
year
in
question
52
to
a
part
of
53
was
about
three-quarters
of
a
million
dollars
in
materials
and
about
1
1/2
million
a
little
more
in
labor
and
shop
overhead.
we
say
a
third
and
two-thirds.
actually,
it’s
32%
and
38%.
again,
anticipating
a
portion
of
our
argument
if
halliburton
oil
well
and
cementing
company,
and
this
is
the
essence,
there
are
two
factual
phases
of
this
case
your
honor,
the
first
we’ve
called,
the
labor
and
shop
overhead
phase
and
the
second,
we
have
called
the
--
the
isolated
sales
phase.
on
the
labor
and
shop
overhead
and
this
is
the
real
heart
of
the
case.
if
louisiana
had
its
production
shops
in
the
state
of
loui
--
i
mean
if
halliburton
had
its
production
shops
in
the
state
of
louisiana
instead
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
there
would
be
no
tax
on
anything
but
cost
element
number
one
materials.
there
would
be
no
cost,
no
sales
tax
upon
labor
and
shop
overhead.
so
the
tax
is
--
they’re
asking
three
times
as
much
tax
because
halliburton
conducted
a
multi-state
operation.
at
page
34
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir.
and
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
if
--
at
page
34
and
34
of
our
brief
is
the
most
important
page
because
on
that
page,
we
have
collected
the
two
vital
elements
of
our
stipulation
of
fact,
page
34
of
the
brief,
that’s
the
larger
of
the
yellow
briefs,
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
the
thicker,
cream-colored
brief.
on
the
labor
and
shop
overhead,
it
is
stipulated
that
if
halliburton
had
operated
on
a
location
within
the
state
of
louisiana,
it
would
have
been
a
sales
tax
in
the
state
of
louisiana
upon
the
cost
of
materials
purchased
in
louisiana
and
a
use
tax
on
materials
purchased
outside
louisiana
but
there
would
have
been
no
louisiana
sales
tax
or
a
use
tax
due
upon
the
labor
and
shop
overhead.
now
will
you
note
that
there’s
a
second
phase,
isolated
phase.
now
one
reason
that
i
started
to
go
into
the
discussion
of
the
law
ahead
of
the
facts,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
that
there
are
two
factual
circumstances
which
--
each
of
which
raise
the
same
facts
and
issue
of
law.
now,
i
will
revert
briefly
back
to
the
henneford
decision
if
this
--
at
this
time
if
i
may.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
sure.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
i
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
duncan,
oklahoma
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
doing
extensive
business
operation
in
louisiana
in
the
year
--
the
tax
years
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
as
your
honor
put
it
in
--
i
think
that
this
covers
it
your
honor’s
words
in
general
trading
company
versus
state
tax
commission,
your
honor
said
this.
of
course
no
state
can
tax
a
privilege
of
doing
interstate
business.
on
the
other
hand,
a
mere
fact
that
property
is
used
for
interstate
commerce
or
has
come
to
rest
or
--
excuse
me
or
has
come
within
an
owner’s
possession
as
a
result
of
interstate
commerce
does
not
diminish
the
protection
which
he
may
--
which
he
may
draw
from
a
state
to
the
upkeep
of
which
he
may
bear
--
maybe
made
to
bear
his
fair
share.
but,
and
you
honor
put
it
this
way,
a
fair
share
precludes
legislation
obviously
hostile
or
practically
discriminatory
to
an
interstate
commerce.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir
and
there
--
the
word
is
cost.
it’s
been
held
to
be
cost
less
depreciation.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
and
then
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
then
it
would
be
upon
the
cost
price
less
than
a
depreciation
which
had
been
incurred
before
it
came
to
the
state.
now
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
it
uses
under
contract,
not
as
a
lessor.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
now,
it
would
be
subject
to
a
sales
tax
upon
the
cost
of
materials
which
were
purchased
in
louisiana
and
a
use
tax
upon
the
cost
of
materials
which
were
reported
into
louisiana
by
that
manufacturer
unit.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
excluding
labor
and
shop
overhead;
that
is
the
stipulation
at
page
34.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
if
halliburton
had
operated
at
a
--
at
a
location
within
louisiana,
there
would
have
been
a
sales
tax
on
materials,
but
“there
would
have
been
no
louisiana
sales
tax
or
a
use
tax
due
upon
the
labor
and
shop
overhead.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
it
is
the
basic
contention
of
halliburton
that
the
interstate
nature
of
its
operations
ought
not
in
it
of
itself
give
rise
to
any
additional
tax
burden,
and
halliburton
should
not
be
taxed
by
louisiana
anymore
heavily
than
it
would
be
taxed
if
halliburton
conducted
the
identical
operation
in
louisiana
minus
the
element
of
interstate
commerce.
the
discrimination
of
which
halliburton
complains
here
arises
on
two
different
sets
of
operative
facts,
that’s
the
discrimination
against
the
interstate
operation
that
in
favor
of
a
comparable
intrastate
operation.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
it
is
a
stipulated
fact
sir
that
halliburton
has
already
paid
100%
of
the
fact
--
of
the
tax
which
it
would
be
required
to
pay
or
which
a
competing
operator,
exactly
the
same
operation
minus
the
element
of
interstate
commerce
would
be
required
to
pay,
100%
and
that
is
a
stipulated
fact.
in
addition
to
the
labor
and
shop
overhead
which
we
have
discussed
to
an
extent,
we
have
the
isolated
sales
phase
of
the
case
which
we
submit,
raises
the
same
issue.
each
phase,
it
is
important
to
remember
that
halliburton
imports
equipment
into
louisiana
for
its
own
use
and
uses
it
there.
it
does
not
buy
or
sell
this
equipment
so
as
to
give
rise
to
a
sales
tax.
the
precise
facts
of
the
labor
and
shop
over
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
sir?
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
we
are
comparing
the
use
tax
on
the
interstate
--
the
sales
tax
and
the
use
tax
of
the
same
statute.
they
have
their
counterparts.
the
use
tax
is
the
interstate
part
and
the
sales
tax
is
the
intra.
you
can’t
compare
--
compare
the
interstate
but
when
you
say
interstate
tax,
you’ve
got
to
say
sales
tax.
when
you
say
--
when
you
say
intra,
you
have
to
say
sales
tax.
when
you
say
interstate,
you
have
to
say
use
tax.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
all
we
are
asking
is
this
postscript
to
the
henneford
case.
henneford
said
that
a
state
tax
--
a
use
tax
although
it
falls
only
on
goods
which
have
been
moved
in
interstate
commerce,
does
not
discriminate
against
the
interstate
commerce
because
it’s
exactly
equal
to
and
no
greater
than,
and
therefore,
it
doesn't
discriminate,
and
since
it
doesn’t
discriminate,
it
doesn’t
defend
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
we
ask
for
this
corollary,
but
if
in
a
given
case,
the
use
tax
which
is
the
interstate
counterpart
is
heavier
than
the
sales
tax
which
is
the
intrastate
phase
of
the
same
tax
law.
when
the
interstate
phase
is
heavier
then
it
does
discriminate
and
because
of
such
discrimination
is
valid
in
the
federal
constitution.
specifically,
could
you
repeal
the
sales
tax
on
the
intrastate
sales
and
leave
a
use
tax
so
that
it
fell
only
upon
in
the
interstate
transaction
goods
imported
into
the
state.
could
you
--
if
you
have
the
use
tax,
the
intrastate
tax
fixed
at
50%
or
a
100%
or
a
1000%
and
leave
the
state
sales
tax
of
2%,
we
submit
that
you
could
not.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
the
vendor
would
not
pay
at
all
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
--
but
he
would
be
the
collecting
agent
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
--
for
the
state
but
he
would
collect
all
his
sales
price.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
which
would
(voice
overlap)
it
would
include
materials
and
labor
and
shop
overhead
and
profit.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
the
collector
and
this
is
the
most
--
fact
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
we
managed
somehow
to
have
seven
judges
disagree
with
us
on
this
and
this
how
they
did
it.
they
said,
this
thing
is
not
--
you
don’t
have
to
compare
the
operation
of
an
intrastate
manufacture
user,
who
manufactures
and
uses
it
himself,
you
can
compare
an
intrastate
manufacture
user
in
halliburton’s
position
with
what
the
sales
tax
would
have
been
if
the
thing
was
so.
now,
the
reason
that
throws
the
thing
your
mind
into
confusion
right
away
sir
is
because
they’re
comparing
non-comparables.
we
say
that
to
test
for
discrimination
and
nondiscrimination,
you
should
compare
comparables
like
transactions,
comparable
transactions
to
a
similar
contraction
--
transactions.
for
example,
and
we
say
that
this
is
the
only
fair
comparison,
that
if
halliburton
oil
well
cementing
company
moved
its
shops
to
louisiana,
or
in
the
alternative
if
they
were
in
louisiana,
direct
competitor
and
precisely
and
exactly
the
same
operation
doing
the
same
kind
of
operation,
would
the
tax
of
the
intrastate
operation
and
the
tax
of
multi-state
or
intrastate
operation
be
the
same.
now
it’s
obviously,
it’s
stipulated
here
that
one
of
them
would
be
taxed
and
the
other
one
would
not
be
taxed
on
the
labor
and
the
shop
overhead.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
it
would
not
be
computed
with
reference
to
cost
sir,
it
would
be
computed
with
reference
to
the
sale
price.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir
or
alternatively
if
it
was
a
bad
week
and
they
were
selling
things
cheap
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
it
might
be
sold
for
a
price
less
than
the
sum
total
of
labor
and
overhead
plus
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
sales
price
is
completely
a
different
thing.
it
is
as
we
see
it,
we
think
that
--
that
to
compare
for
fairness,
you've
got
to
compare
the
same
type
of
operation.
and
that
sir
is
one
of
the
--
what
we
think
is
one
of
the
basic
fallacies
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
turning
briefly
to
the
other
phase
of
the
case,
before
i
get
to
that,
it
might
be
interesting
on
the
labor
and
shop
overhead
to
see
one
of
the
things
that
the
louisiana
collector
said
in
his
motion
to
dismiss
about
this
labor
and
shop
overhead.
he
says
that
for
halliburton,
“this
is
not
an
interstate
commerce
problem,
but
a
problem
of
management
in
locating
its
operations
so
as
to
reduce
its
cost
of
operations.
a
taxpayer
may
reduce
his
tax
burden
by
manufacturing
equipment
within
louisiana
for
his
own
use.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
we've
discussed
that
in
our
brief
under
the
heading,
"a
problem
of
management",
save
louisiana
taxes
by
manufacturing
in
louisiana.
frankly,
that
seems
to
us
in
incredible.
the
collector
contends
that
his
position
is
nondiscriminatory.
simultaneously,
he
argues
it
by
a
good
corporate
management,
halliburton
could
have
avoided
this
louisiana
tax
by
ceasing
its
interstate
operations
and
becoming
an
entirely
domestic
or
intrastate
operator,
having
its
entire
operation
with
louisiana
--
within
louisiana’s
borders.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
well,
sir
--
and
that
is
his
position
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
it
would
sir
and
this
case
if
i
--
i
have
this
--
halliburton
and
halliburton’s
counsel
have
never
been
able
to
see
any
complexion
to
this
case.
at
interstate
commerce,
you've
got
a
tax,
take
away
interstate
commerce,
and
you've
got
no
tax
and
that
is
stipulated
parenthetically
with
reference
to
the
stipulation
that
appear
on
page
34.
it
is
one
of
the
most
eloquent
arguments
that
we
can
make.
atlantic
counsel
for
the
collector
has
never
mentioned
those
in
any
of
his
briefs
or
in
any
of
his
arguments
to
any
court
and
we
forecast
that
he
will
not
mention
them
here
unless
specifically
cross-examined.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
stipulations
which
appear
found
on
page
34
sir.
with
reference
to
the
second
factual
situation
relating
to
isolated
sales,
an
isolated
sale
or
a
casual
sale
as
defined
by
louisiana
law
is
a
sale
by
a
person
not
regularly
engaged
in
selling
the
type
of
goods
in
question.
isolated
sales
are
expressly
exempted
from
the
louisiana
intrastate
sales
tax.
for
example,
if
i
should
have
sold
in
louisiana,
in
baton
rouge,
before
i
left
to
let
a
counsel
for
the
collector.
i’ll
offer
for
my
necktie,
assuming
that
i’m
not
regularly
engaged
in
the
business
of
merchandising
such
acts,
there
would
have
been
no
louisiana
sales
tax
on
that
casual
isolated
transaction
because
such
transactions
from
persons
not
regularly
engaged
in
selling
for
tax
free
by
specific
exemption
from
the
sales
tax
and
that
also
is
stipulated
on
page
34
of
our
brief
in
this
language
because
this
is
applied
to
halliburton
situation
but
it
covers
this
precisely.
the
entire
purchase
price
would
not
have
been
subject
to
the
louisiana
sales
tax
or
the
louisiana
use
tax
had
the
purchase
of
such
equipment
been
made
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
now
of
course
when
i
bought
this
tie
in
baton
rouge,
it
had
a
2%
sales
tax
upon
it.
if
i
should
resell
it
to
the
collector
in
baton
rouge,
there
would
have
been
no
2%
use
tax
upon
it
that's
stipulated.
but
if
i
should
sell
them
in
this
courtroom,
this
larva
or
this
necktie
and
if
he
should
take
them
and
put
them
in
his
briefcase,
the
book
and
the
necktie
around
his
neck
and
move
them
in
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
back
to
louisiana
and
they'll
use
it,
if
he
should
walk
into
the
office
of
the
collector
of
revenue
wearing
his
necktie
which
he
bought
in
the
office
--
in
the
supreme
court
room
in
washington,
the
collector
would
say,
"did
you
buy
that
outside
the
state?
if
you
did
and
if
you
moved
it
in
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce,
you
owe
me
a
2%
use
tax."
now,
of
course
it
wouldn’t
be
sales
tax
if
you
had
bought
it
in
louisiana,
but
whenever
you
add
the
element
of
interstate
transportation
to
casually
purchased
or
isolated
--
isolated
sales,
we
want
to
a
use
tax
because
there
is
no
comparable
--
or
isolated
transaction
in
the
use
tax,
the
interstate
part
of
louisiana
sales
and
use
tax
statute.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir,
it's
the
same
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
it
is
a
less
important
point
only
in
that
it
involves
less
money
and
only
in
that
it
does
not
recur
with
the
complete
regularity
of
the
other
point.
but
as
we
see
it,
the
two
exactly
the
same,
in
the
case
of
the
labor
and
overhead,
a
manufacturer
outside
the
state
step
one,
a
transport
of
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
and
leave
the
state
and
use
it.
in
the
case
of
the
isolated
sales,
they
buy
it
outside
the
state,
they
move
it
in
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
and
they
use
it.
now,
if
you
eliminate
that
multi-state
activity
in
each
one,
it
is
stipulated
that
there
is
no
tax
and
that
stipulation
which
we
forecast
that
the
collector
will
ignore
is
as
follows.
in
reference
to
labor
and
overhead,
halliburton
operated
in
a
location
within
the
state
of
louisiana,
there
would
have
been
no
louisiana
sales
tax
or
use
tax
due
upon
the
labor
and
shop
overhead.
with
reference
to
isolated
sales,
again
at
page
34
stipulated,
the
purchase
price
would
not
have
been
subject
to
louisiana
sales
tax
or
the
louisiana
use
tax
at
the
sale
--
at
the
purchase
of
such
equipment
been
made
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
henneford
simply
--
in
the
henneford
case,
the
silas
mason
company
had
brought
into
the
state
of
washington
heavy
moving
equipment
to
construct
the
grand
coulee
dam
and
they
said,
"look,
you
can’t
put
this
use
tax
on
us
by
definition,
it
implies
only
to
goods
that
have
been
brought
across
the
state
line
in
interstate
commerce."
not
so,
said
mr.
justice
cardozo
through
this
item
of
the
use
tax
only
falls
upon
goods
which
have
been
moved
in
interstate
commerce
but
the
tax
is
exactly
equal
to
and
does
not
discriminate
and
therefore
it
does
not
offend
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
we
wish
to
recapitulate
briefly
our
arguments
of
yesterday
and
reserve
our
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
louisiana
sales
tax
as
the
intrastate
tax
upon
the
intrastate
sales.
louisiana
use
tax
is
the
interstate
tax
which
falls
only
upon
the
use
within
the
state
of
louisiana
of
goods
imported
into
the
state
across
state
lines
and
then
used
in
louisiana.
halliburton
simply
says
that
the
interstate
use
tax
ought
not
to
be
any
heavier
than
the
intrastate
sales
tax
would
be
in
an
identical
situation
minus
only
interstate
commerce.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct
in
our
view
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
oh
yes,
sir.
well,
actually,
i
--
it's
inconceivable
sir
to
me
that
the
use
tax
standing
alone
since
by
very
definition,
it
implies
only
upon
goods
imported
across
state
lines.
i
should
--
let
me
straighten
that
out
a
little
bit.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
in
the
nature
of
the
interstate
commerce
clause
and
the
protections
afforded
by
it.
if
the
use
tax
as
it
now
exists
(falling
only
upon
goods
which
have
crossed
state
line).
a
use
tax
in
that
nature
if
it
stood
alone
and
there
were
no
comparable
intrastate
sales
tax,
we
submit
that
that
be
--
unconstitutionality
would
be
rather
obvious.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
now
in
that
case
your
honor,
you're
--
you
are
supposing
that
they
were
two
interstate
operators.
now,
there's
nothing
parenthetically
requires
--
the
interstate
commerce
clause
doesn't
cover
two
interstate
operators.
you'd
get
over
to
due
process,
but
again,
i
miss
--
i'm
getting
away
from
my
point.
what
--
my
point
is
this,
if
halliburton
were
selling
then
the
appropriate
comparison
would
be
halliburton
the
interstate
salesman
with
an
intrastate
salesman,
since
halliburton
is
not
selling
but
he's
manufacturing
for
his
own
use.
we
submit
that
the
proper
comparison
is
between
halliburton,
the
interstate
manufacturer-user
and
comparable
intrastate
comparab
--
intrastate
manufacturer-user.
one
of
the
basic
fallacies
sir
as
we
see
it
at
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
of
the
louisiana
collector
is
that
in
their
test
for
discrimination,
they
do
compare
such
unlike
dissimilar
and
non-comparable
transactions.
and
if
they
make
that
argument
here
today
and
we
anticipate
that
they
will,
we
would
like
the
attention
of
this
court
to
be
already
focused
upon
its
area
and
speciousness.
it
is
totally
impossible
for
the
collector
of
revenue
of
the
state
of
louisiana
to
sustain
his
position.
we
say
impossible,
and
we
say
that
deliberately,
sustain
his
position
on
the
labor
and
shop
overhead
fees
that
is
if
there's
no
arbitrary
tax
discrimination.
if
he
does
make
a
fair
comparison
between
two
comparable
economic
activities,
one
interstate
and
the
other
intrastate,
we
submit
that
the
test
for
discrimination
one
must
compare
comparables,
that
the
only
fair
comparison
is
to
compare
the
tax
burden
of
an
outers
to
out-of-state.
that
is
an
interstate
manufacturer-user
such
as
halliburton
with
the
tax
burden
of
a
comparable
intrastate
manufacturer-user.
in
other
words,
if
halliburton
had
a
direct
competitor
in
louisiana,
in
exactly
the
same
business
operation
lacking
only
the
interstate
commerce's
element
with
the
tax
burden
of
each
be
the
same.
now,
since
the
collect
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
we
would
--
we
don't
feel
it's
quite
necessary
to
make
that
basic
premise.
we
say
that
if
you
are
going
to
--
no,
i
agree
with
you
exactly.
i'll
go
back
and
pick
it
all
up.
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
a
class,
a
group
of
people,
a
bunch
of
manufacturers
who
use
their
own
product,
you've
got
to
treat
them
all
alike.
if
halliburton
came
into
louisiana
and
sold
it,
it
would
be
proper
to
compare
them
with
a
wholly
intrastate
operation
where
the
operation
was
simply
a
sale.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
that
is
our
position.
we
say
that
since
the
collector
has
stipulated
that
the
burden
here
would
be
three-to-one
as
compared
to
an
intrastate
manufacturer-user,
that's
actually
a
little
misleading.
its
taxation
price
has
no
taxation
on
the
labor
and
the
overhead
element.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
let
us
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
now
we
don't
think
that
you
could
repeal
the
sales
tax
and
keep
the
interstate
use
tax.
we
don't
think
you
could
put
the
sales
tax
at
2%
and
put
the
interstate
use
tax
at
500%.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
the
sale
--
the
sales
tax
just
does
exactly
that.
it
ex
--
it
has
many
exemptions.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
in
louisiana
sir,
there
are
certain
statutes
on
our
books
which
apply
only
to
cities
over
500,000
and
that
includes
to
only
new
orleans.
now
conceivably,
that
type
of
thing
could
be
done
but
that
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
right
sir.
but
that
i
don't
believe
is
what
we're
talking
about
here.
we
say
for
example
that
they
could
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
conceivably
it
might
sir,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
that
situation
here.
for
example
--
let's
put
it
this
way.
the
sales
tax
is
historically
proc
--
preceded
the
use
taxes.
it
was
soon
found
that
although
people
would
buy
their
pencils
and
their
cigarettes
in
the
state,
they
would
go
across
the
state
into
the
non-taxing
state
for
their
automobiles
and
their
refrigerators.
now,
so
they
put
in
the
use
tax
to
make
them
equal.
now,
let's
suppose
that
in
the
louisiana
tax,
in
the
next
legislature,
they
should
say
in
louisiana,
automobiles
are
going
to
be
exempted
from
the
sales
tax.
i
don't
think
that
they
could
collect
a
use
tax
on
imported
automobiles.
i
think
by
definition,
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
now,
one
of
the
incredible
things
that
i
think
you
gentlemen
will
find
in
this
brief
amicus
curiae,
one
of
the
briefs
amicus
curiae
is
that
louisiana
fields
are
total
freedom,
a
total
freedom
to
exempt
from
the
sales
tax
without
any
comparable
exemption
from
the
use
tax.
incredibly,
they
got
an
exemption
from
the
sales
tax
of
"vessels
and
ships
and
ships
and
supplies
and
vessel
supplies
if
made
in
louisiana
shipyards."
if
this
court
says
that
the
use
tax
--
if
this
court
should
uphold
them
in
saying
that
the
use
tax,
the
interstate
tax
shall
be
heavier
than
the
intrastate
sales
tax,
then
we
submit
that
they
could
refill
the
sales
tax
and
keep
the
use
tax
and
we
submit
that
by
implication,
this
court
would
uphold
that
incredible
exemption,
exemption
from
the
sales
tax
of
vessels
made
in
louisiana
shipyards.
if
you
have
a
vessel
that's
made
in
louisiana
shipyard
and
it's
sold,
there's
no
sale
on
the
original
transaction.
if
it's
resold
in
the
casual
sale,
there's
no
sale
--
sales
tax
on
the
original
transaction.
if
you
go
across
the
biloxi
though
or
to
some
state
that
doesn't
have
a
sales
tax
law
and
you'd
get
a
vessel
and
you
trailer
it
back
--
float
it
back
through
the
rigolets
into
louisiana
then
when
you
bring
it
up
to
the
state
line
they
collect
--
they'd
flagged
you
down
say,
"that's
not
a
vessel
that
was
made
in
louisiana,
pay
me
2%
use
tax.”
the
collector
feels
an
incredible
freedom
we
feel
here
to
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir,
i
should
say.
henneford
versus
silas
mason
company
in
that
case,
this
high
court
upheld
a
use
tax
of
the
state
of
washington,
although
it
fell
only
upon
transactions
involving
interstate
commerce
because
in
the
case
then
at
bar,
the
use
tax
of
the
state
of
washington
did
not
exceed
the
state
--
the
sales
tax
of
the
same
state
but
was
merely
complementary
to
and
precisely
equal
to
it.
and
therefore,
the
use
tax
did
not
discriminate
and
hence
did
not
offend
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
now,
it
is
unquestionable
we
submit
that
this
was
the
rationale
of
the
henneford
case.
in
the
henneford
versus
silas
mason
case,
mr.
justice
cardozo
had
this
to
say,
"equality
is
the
theme
that
runs
through
all
sections
of
the
washington
statute.
when
the
account
is
made
up,
the
stranger
from
afar
is
subject
to
no
great
burdens
than
the
dweller
within
the
gates.
in
each
situation,
the
burden
of
a
use
tax
is
balanced
by
an
equal
burden
of
the
sales
tax
where
the
sale
is
strictly
local.”
and
mr.
justice
cardozo
concluded
a
non-discriminatory
tax
has
never
been
regarded
as
imposing
a
direct
burden
upon
the
interstate
commerce.
now,
it's
our
simple
position
here
today
that
implicit
in
the
silas
mason
case
and
correctly
so
is
that
whenever
the
interstate
use
tax
does
levy
a
burden
which
is
heavier
than
the
burden
of
the
comparably
intrastate
sale
tax
in
an
identical
situation,
minus
only
the
element
of
interstate
commerce,
then
the
interstate
use
tax,
it
does
discriminate
him
because
of
such
discrimination
is
violative
of
the
federal
constitution.
in
silas
mason,
the
use
tax
was
upheld
because
it
was
not
heavier
than
the
sales
tax
and
therefore
no
discrimination.
all
we
seek
here
is
what
seems
to
us
to
be
the
already
implicit
corollary
ruling
that
if
in
a
given
case
the
use
tax
is
heavier
than
the
sales
tax
then
it
does
discriminate
against
on
--
interstate
commerce
as
unconstitutional.
why
has
this
issue
not
reached
the
state
--
this
court
before?
the
reason
is
simple,
wherever
it
was
raised
before
it's
been
decided
for
the
taxpayer
at
a
lower
level.
in
ohio
and
north
dakota,
it's
been
ruled
administratively
that
since
labor
and
overhead
are
excluded
from
the
tax
base
of
the
sales
tax,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
a
similar
exclusion
from
the
use
tax
base.
in
california
and
oklahoma,
the
courts
have
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
use
tax
carefully
interpreting
the
use
tax
base
to
exclude
all
items
excluded
from
the
sales
tax
base
and
pointing
to
the
constitutional
necessity
for
so
doing.
in
one
case
and
only
one,
in
alabama,
the
issue
was
squarely
raised.
it
was
raised
in
the
isolated
sales
phase
of
the
case.
there
were
five
barges
that
were
sold
in
an
isolated
sale
and
the
state
of
alabama
took
the
position
or
act
as
an
isolated
sale
exempted
from
the
sales
tax
but
there's
no
comparable
exemption
for
the
use
tax
on
identical
situation.
of
course
that
case
is
not
authority
for
this
court,
but
we
submit
that
it
persuades
you
because
it's
intelligently
written
and
we
--
we've
gone
to
it
at
length
in
our
brief
and
it
holds
precisely
what
we
have
said
here
in
almost
towards
one
(inaudible).
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
state
versus
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
bay
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
bay
towing
&
dredging
company.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
this,
as
we
see
it,
if
the
use
tax
is
construed
as
imposing
a
tax
on
the
use
in
the
state
of
tangible
personal
property
purchased
outside
the
state
in
casual
and
isolated
sales
transactions,
such
tax
would
constitute
an
unlawful
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
contrary
to
commerce
clause
of
united
state
constitution
since
no
similar
equivalent
tax
burden
is
imposed
in
connection
with
the
purchase
of
such
property
in
casual
and
isolated
sales
transaction
within
the
state.
can
it
--
continue
to
quote,
"the
united
states
supreme
court
has
held
that
a
use
tax
integrated
with
a
sales
tax
in
amount
of
some
odd
hours
is
not
violative
of
the
commerce
clause
when
such
a
system
of
taxation
does
not
discriminate
against
transaction
in
interstate
commerce
but
merely
equalizes
the
burden
of
taxation
on
purchases
made
in
the
interstate
commerce
and
on
strictly
local
sales",
citing
henneford
versus
silas
mason
company.
however,
if
such
a
system
of
taxation
places
a
discriminatory
burden
on
transactions
in
interstate
commerce
which
would
not
apply
to
local
sales,
the
use
tax
will
become
unconstitutional
in
its
operation.
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
said
in
best
versus
maxwell,
the
commerce
clause
forbids
discrimination
where
the
forthright
are
ingenious,
in
each
case
it
is
our
duty
to
determine
where
the
statute
under
attack,
whatever
its
name
maybe,
well
in
its
practical
operation,
work
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
i
believe
that's
our
case.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
member
of
the
court.
one
of
the
justices
has
asked
the
direct
question
with
whom
this
halliburton
contract
in
the
use
of
this
equipment.
a
contract
with
oil
well
operators,
they
will
bring
this
thing
up
to
an
oil
well
and
do
whatever
needs
to
be
done
to
an
oil
well
to
make
it
work
better.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
no
sir.
they've
--
they
contract
to
perform
a
service,
just
as
a
plumber
comes
out
to
your
house
to
fix
it.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
let's
take
the
case
of
the
small
boy
who
bought
parts
for
his
radio.
let
us
suppose
that
he
was
given
$50
for
a
christmas
present
and
he
went
downtown
and
bought
$50
worth
of
parts.
and
when
he
got
home
with
them,
he
found
he
couldn't
put
them
together,
so
he
knew
a
radio
mechanic
down
the
street
who
could
and
he
persuaded
his
father
to
advance
him
$100.
and
so
he
went
down,
he
had
that
radio
put
together
in
louisiana,
and
he
ended
up
with
a
cost
price
of
$150.
he
would
have
paid
a
sales
tax
on
that
$50
worth
of
parts
and
he
would
not
have
paid
a
sales
tax
on
the
$100
worth
of
labor
and
shop
overhead,
the
cost
of
putting
these
loose
parts
together
and
to
assemble
the
product.
now,
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
the
neighboring
state,
mississippi
had
no
sales
tax.
and
suppose
that
he
did
not
know
in
louisiana
a
skilled
mechanic
who
could
put
this
particular
type
of
radio
together.
and
so
he
put
the
parts
in
the
back
of
his
father's
station
wagon
and
he
drove
across
the
mississippi
line
to
biloxi
where
the
skilled
mechanic
lived.
and
there,
he
spent
his
$100.
so
now,
he
has
$150
invested
in
a
completive
radio.
and
so
they
put
it
in
the
station
wagon
and
they
drive
back
to
louisiana
and
at
the
state
line,
the
collector
flags
him
down.
and
they
do
just
that
by
keeping
tab
on
railroad
--
railway
express
receipts.
but
they
flagged
him
down
at
the
state
line
and
they
say,
"there,
you
have
a
radio
and
what
is
your
cost
price?"
our
cost
price
is
$50
per
parts
and
$100
for
labor
and
overhead.
so
the
collector
says,
"fine,
give
me
2%
of
the
cost
price
of
$150."
"oh,
but
i've
already
paid
it
on
$50
worth
when
i
bought
the
parts."
"fine,
we'll
give
you
credit
for
that
but
we
want
2%
of
this
labor
and
overhead
because
it
was
expanded
in
mississippi."
and
the
man
being
acquainted
with
the
halliburton
problem
says,
"not
so."
had
we
employed
the
people
to
put
it
together
in
louisiana,
had
there
been
no
element
of
multi-
activity
and
no
element
of
interstate
movement
of
goods,
there
would've
been
no
tax
on
the
labor
and
overhead.
surely,
multi-state
activity
and
interstate
movement
of
goods
should
not
in
and
of
themselves
generate
a
tax
where
none
existed
without
that
element
of
interstate
movement.
suppose
halliburton
in
the
days
before
texas
had
a
sales
tax,
they've
only
have
one
for
a
few
months,
suppose
they
brought
their
factories
and
their
production
shops
and
nestled
them
right
up
against
the
louisiana
line,
put
the
whitewash
fence
along
the
line
separating
their
factory
from
louisiana.
and
suppose
just
on
the
other
side
of
that
whitewash
fence,
a
competitor
setup
an
identical
factory
which
made
the
same
thing.
now,
halliburton
makes
them
on
the
texas
side
and
imports
them
into
louisiana
for
use.
the
competitor
makes
them
on
the
louisiana
side
and
uses
them
in
louisiana.
the
labor
and
shop
overhead
would
not
be
taxed
to
the
one
who
operated
in
louisiana
that
is
stipulated.
the
labor
and
shop
overhead
would
be
taxed
under
the
collector's
position
here
today.
that
one
additional
inch
or
actually
the
crossing
of
that
imaginary
state
line
there,
the
infinite
point
of
space
that
is
the
line
would
generate
the
additional
tax
in
view
of
what
the
collector
has
to
say.
now,
the
reason
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
here
with
reference
to
--
no
arguments
had
ever
been
made
before
in
any
court,
with
reference
to
these
other
taxes
is
because
as
this
court
be
judicially
notice,
here,
halliburton
had
in
this
brief
tax
years,
$2,500,000
worth
of
this
type
of
equipment
in
the
state.
halliburton
is
a
major
operator
in
the
field
of
oil
well
servicing.
it
has
a
massive
operation
in
louisiana.
and
as
this
court
may
judicially
notice,
there
would
be
many
thousands
of
dollars,
hundred
to
thousands
of
dollars
in
one
form
or
another
derived
over
the
general
taxes
which
would
apply
to
such
a
massively
operating
domesticated
board
corporation.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference
there
at
all
your
honor.
the
argument
is
--
and
i
would
say
that
apparently
opposing
counsel
doesn't
think
so
either
since
that
argument
has
never
been
advanced
at
any
part
of
this
case
until
he
was
mentioned
in
this
court
today.
in
our
anxiety
to
get
to
each
point
of
the
case,
we
have
failed
to
point
out
what
appears
to
be
the
collector's
major
argument
in
his
brief
that
what
appears
to
be
the
major
ground
for
the
louisiana
supreme
court
decision.
how
do
the
louisiana
authorities
try
to
justify
their
flagrant
tax
discrimination?
shaken
down
to
its
tests,
we
submit
that
it
is
simply
this
and
we
quote
from
the
collector's
brief,
"the
tax,"
he
says,
"is
not
upon
interstate
commerce
or
is
it
upon
the
privilege
of
use
after
commerce
is
at
an
end."
this
is
his
primary
contention.
he
repeats
it
in
the
last
paragraph
of
his
brief,
"the
use
tax
is
imposed
for
one
reason
only
because
the
property
had
become
a
part
of
the
massive
property
in
the
state",
and
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
adopted
that
as
its
major
premise.
he
--
its
concluding
language.
we
conclude
that
the
louisiana
use
tax
does
not
infringe
upon
interstate
commerce
because
the
tax
matter
had
definitely
come
vested
in
the
state.
and
they
quote
the
silas
–
from
the
silas
mason
case
this
language,
"the
tax
is
not
upon
the
operation
of
interstate
commerce
but
upon
the
privilege
of
use
after
commerce
is
an
end."
but
they
do
not
quote
mr.
justice
cardozo's
concluding
language
which
is
as
follows,
"with
reference
to
good
move
in
interstate
commerce,
they
may
be
subjected",
he
says,
"once
they
are
at
rest
to
a
non-discriminatory
tax
upon
use
of
the
majority."
of
course,
mr.
justice
cardozo's
words
that
commerce
is
at
an
end
cannot
be
used
to
justify
discriminatory
taxation.
now,
this
is
not
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
because
commerce
is
at
an
end.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
classification
for
tax
purposes,
separate
discriminatory
classification,
separate
and
heavier
tax
treatment
being
base
solely
upon
the
history
of
there
having
been
an
interstate
movement
of
goods,
no
matter
how
thin
the
argument
is
sliced.
louisiana
is
still
demanding
in
both
faces
of
this
case
tax
money
which
it
would
not
demand
if
there
were
no
element
of
interstate
commerce.
eliminate
interstate
commerce,
both
face
result
no
taxation.
add
interstate
commerce,
both
faces
result
taxation.
if
the
collector
argues
and
this
appears
to
be
his
number
two
position
and
we
quote
that
the
tax
operates
alike
upon
all
persons
and
property
similarly
situated.
let
us
examine
this
"tax
classification."
classification
a
of
the
collector,
to
be
taxed
for
heavily
those
who
operate
in
interstate
commerce.
classification
b,
to
be
taxed
likely
or
not
at
all
those
who
operate
wholly
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
as
classification
a
taxpayers,
interstate
operators
are
all
similarly
situated
says
the
collector
and
they're
all
taxed
heavily.
classification
b
taxpayers,
intrastate
operators
were
all
similarly
situated
and
they're
all
taxed
more
lightly.
now,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
where
the
test
for
taxation
is
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
interstate
commerce
and
the
interstate
commerce
clause
as
the
governing
principle,
we
therefore
would
base
halliburton's
conclusion
of
unconstitutionality
upon
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
nevertheless,
quite
aside
from
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
we
submit
that
this
is
the
case
of
growth
discrimination
of
arbitrary
classification
which
is
forbidden
by
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
clause
and
the
due
process
clause.
assume
arguendo
that
halliburton
was
--
were
an
intrastate
operator
sitting
side-by-side
in
louisiana
with
another
intrastate
operator,
a
competitor.
and
assume
that
halliburton
was
being
taxed
three
times
as
much
as
that
competitor
or
more
accurately
being
taxed
upon
a
pace
which
is
tax
exempt
to
that
competitor.
we
submit
that
there's
simply
no
excuse
in
law
for
such
discrimination
even
if
there
were
no
element
of
interstate
commerce
and
a
fortiori,
the
tax
discrimination
cannot
be
valid
where
the
--
it's
only
test
for
taxation
is
the
presence
and
absence
of
interstate
commerce.
it
seems
to
us
that
both
the
facts
and
the
law
are
simple
and
clear
cut
on
both
phases
of
this
case.
first
phase,
labor
and
overhead.
facts,
halliburton
manufactured
outside
of
louisiana
and
oklahoma.
second,
halliburton
transported
in
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
and
used
in
louisiana.
law,
movement
of
goods
in
interstate
commerce
ought
not
in
and
of
itself
generated
2%
tax
on
labor
and
shop
overhead
which
would
not
had
been
liberty
of
no
movement
to
interstate
commerce.
second
phase,
isolated
sales,
facts,
halliburton
purchased
outside
louisiana,
in
new
york
and
texas.
two,
halliburton
transported
in
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce.
three,
halliburton
used
in
louisiana.
law,
interstate
movement
of
goods
by
halliburton
and
movement
of
goods
in
interstate
commerce
by
halliburton
ought
not
in
and
of
itself
generated
2%
tax
on
the
transaction,
2%
of
cost
price
of
the
casual
sale
which
would
not
have
existed
at
all
if
there
were
no
element
of
interstate
commerce.
now,
louisiana
could
avoid
tax
discrimination
here
in
one
of
two
ways.
louisiana
could
add
to
the
tax
base
of
the
intrastate
business
so
as
to
equalize
it
with
the
interstate
tax
--
the
interstate
state
business'
taxation.
for
example,
labor
and
overhead
could
be
taxed
where
it
performed
in
louisiana
as
well
as
where
it
performed
outside
louisiana
or
the
isolated
sales
exemption
could
be
limited
--
could
be
eliminated
as
to
intrastate
sales
thus
equalize
it.
louisiana
will
not
follow
this
path.
the
alternative
path
is
the
only
one
left
as
we
see
it.
louisiana
can
and
we
submit
must
eliminate
these
items
from
the
tax
base
of
the
interstate
operator
as
well
as
the
intrastate
operator.
either
method
would
abolish
the
inequity,
the
discrimination
which
complaint
is
here
has
made.
but
what
louisiana
cannot
constitutionally
do
is
to
include
in
the
tax
base
of
the
multi-state
operator,
the
intrastate
business
concerned,
a
substantial
element
while
excluding
that
same
substantial
element
from
the
tax
base
of
intrastate
business
whose
activities
are
exactly
the
same
except
for
the
presence
or
absence
of
interstate
commerce.
is
there
any
another
question
that
any
member
of
the
court
would
like
to
ask
as
we
close?
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
second
argument
of
one
of
the
cases
which
was
argued
before
eight-judge
court
last
term.
this
is
a
suit
for
refund
on
tax
moneys
paid
under
protest
to
the
state
of
louisiana
where
the
field
of
state
taxation
of
interstate
commerce,
constitutional
law,
the
interstate
commerce
clause
forbids
tax
discrimination
by
states
against
interstate
commerce.
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
clause
or
the
due
process
clause
forbids
arbitrary
tax
discrimination
by
states
even
if
there
is
no
element
of
interstate
commerce.
classifications
for
tax
purposes
may
not
be
held
by
the
arbiter.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
held
that
louisiana
may
discriminate
against
the
multistate
or
interstate
business
and
thus
give
a
direct
commercial
advantage
to
local
business.
it
held
specifically
that
louisiana
may
place
an
excise
tax
upon
the
interstate
business
of
halliburton
which
is
three
times
as
heavy
as
the
tax
burden
would
be
--
upon
the
same
identical,
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“identical”
operation
if
it
were
purely
local
and
intra-louisiana.
the
halliburton
company
of
duncan,
oklahoma
has
appealed
from
the
louisiana
supreme
court
urging
the
invalidity
of
the
discriminatory
tax
and
claiming
the
constitutional
protection
of
three
clauses,
interstate
commerce,
equal
protection
and
due
process.
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
the
tax
in
question
is
the
louisiana
use
tax,
a
part
of
the
sales
and
use
tax
law
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
tax
rate
is
2%.
the
case
of
the
sales
tax,
the
intrastate
tax,
the
rate
is
2%
of
the
sales
price
of
intrastate
sales.
in
the
case
of
the
use
tax,
the
interstate
tax,
the
rate
is
2%
of
cost
price
to
the
purchaser
who
imports,
that
is
who
purchases
outside
louisiana
and
imports
through
channels
of
interstate
commerce
into
louisiana
for
its
own
use.
halliburton's
complaint
is
not
of
the
tax
rate
which
is
2%
in
both
cases
but
halliburton
does
complain
of
discrimination
in
the
determination
of
the
tax
basis
to
which
the
2%
rate
is
applied.
specifically,
halliburton
complains
that
the
tax
base
is
larger,
three
times
larger
in
the
case
of
the
intrastate
use
tax
which
falls
upon
halliburton
and
the
tax
base
would
be
in
the
case
of
the
intrastate
sales
tax
which
would
fall
upon
a
local
intrastate
competitor
of
halliburton
in
an
identical
--
in
an
identical
intrastate
business
operation.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
oh,
i
think
there's
a
split
of
opinion
on
that,
sir.
i
think
that
the
collector
of
revenue
thinks
--
says
that's
the
way
the
statute
is
written.
we
disagree
with
him
on
that.
we
think
that
this
problem
is
with
his
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
we
disagree
with
--
we
don't
think
the
statute
needed
to
be
construed
that
way
but
in
any
event
it
has
been
construed
that
way
so
we
are
faced
with
that
as
a
jurisprudence
of
louisiana
unless
this
court
reverses
this
court
--
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
what
are
the
facts
of
this
case?
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
but
you
can.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
say
that
the
statute
has
construed
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
--
violates
the
constitution
of
united
states.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
the
facts
of
this
case,
halliburton
is
a
manufacturer,
please
let
me
emphasize
that
because
opposing
counsel
is
going
to
try
to
lose
sight
of
that
fact.
halliburton
is
manufacturer.
it
is
a
manufacturer
which
uses
its
own
work
product.
and
economists
would
classify
it
as
a
manufacturer-user
or
producer
consumer.
halliburton
is
not
engaged
in
buying
or
selling
its
product
so
as
to
give
rise
to
the
intrastate
sales
tax.
note
particularly
that
halliburton
does
not
buy
this
finished
product
anywhere
but
halliburton
is
a
manufacturer
which
manufactures
a
product
for
its
own
use.
halliburton
does
not
buy
this
finished
product
anywhere.
halliburton
imports
into
louisiana
certain
equipment
which
it
has
manufactured
in
its
own
production
shops
in
oklahoma
and
it
uses
this
equipment
in
louisiana.
thus,
halliburton
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
--
on
page
16
of
the
record,
we
found
it
quite
helped
to
visualize
this
equipment,
opposite
page
16
of
the
record,
you'll
see
a
piece
of
this
equipment.
the
cost
of
materials
that
goes
into
that
which
of
course
would
include
the
truck
chassis
sir,
is
roughly
one-third
of
total
cost,
the
cost
of
labor
and
overhead
in
assembling
this
rather
intricate
piece
of
scientific
equipment
which
is
used
to
service
oil
wells.
and
the
labor
and
overhead
element
is
$60,000.
and
here
your
honor,
you
put
your
finger
on
the
essence
of
the
case
that
the
labor
and
overhead
is
two-thirds
of
cost
and
the
cost
of
materials
is
one-third
of
costs.
specifically,
if
halliburton
had
its
shops
in
louisiana,
there
would
be
a
sales
tax
on
the
cost
of
materials
but
there
would
be
no
sales
tax
or
use
tax
on
the
labor
and
shop
overhead
expanded
in
louisiana.
one
of
these
things
comes
up
to
the
louisiana
state
line,
the
collector
hails
it
down
and
he
says,
“i've
just
audited
your
books
halliburton,
and
i
see
that
on
your
books,
this
thing
stands
at
$90,000.
$30,000
of
that
is
materials,
$60,000
is
that
of
labor
and
overhead,
you're
going
to
bring
that
thing
into
louisiana
and
use
it,
you've
got
to
pay
me
2%
of
$90,000”.
“not
so”,
says
halliburton.
“we'll
pay
you
2%
of
the
$30,000
cost
of
materials
and
we
won't
pay
you
anything
more”.
and
we
say
that
because
if
we
had
our
production
shops
in
louisiana,
if
we
were
a
manufacturer
in
louisiana
instead
of
manufacturer
in
oklahoma,
we
would
pay
a
sales
tax
on
materials,
there
will
be
no
tax
on
labor
and
overhead.
intrastate
labor
and
overhead
is
tax
free.
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
state
of
louisiana
and
to
this
court
that
multistate
or
intrastate
labor
and
overhead
should
be
equally
tax
free.
if
in
the
recipe,
no
new
ingredient
is
added
to
the
recipe
except
the
element
of
interstate
commerce,
we
say
that
that
should
not
affect
the
ultimate
tax
result
and
that
is
the
situation
here
no
matter
how
thin
it
is
sliced.
multistate
activity
and
interstate
movement
of
goods
cannot
constitutionally
generate
a
tax
which
would
not
exist
in
the
absence
of
that.
if
halliburton
had
it's
--
suppose
halliburton
had
a
shop
right
on
the
louisiana-texas
line
and
suppose
--
let's
put
loui
--
halliburton
just
outside
the
louisiana-texas
line
over
in
texas.
let's
put
a
competitive
halliburton
right
jump
against
the
line
on
the
--
in
the
louisiana
side.
let's
put
a
one
inch
wide
whitewash
fence
line
between
them
by
the
ones
that
the
competitor
--
to
producers
in
louisiana
and
uses
itself,
there
will
be
a
2%
tax
on
the
$30,000
materials
element.
there
would
be
no
louisiana
tax
on
the
labor
and
shop
overhead
but
every
unit
produce
one
inch
further
away
from
the
louisiana
state
capital
across
that
line
in
texas
assuming
that
texas
had
no
such
statutes
to
such
costs.
for
every
one
of
those
units
that
make
--
moves
that
extra
inch
of
difference
which
makes
it
an
interstate
transaction,
louisiana
says,
“we're
going
to
tax
that
labor
and
overhead”.
now,
the
tax
here
sir,
is
in
a
ratio.
discrimination
is
in
a
ratio
of
three
to
one.
but
that's
a
happenstance.
we're
talking
about
tax
versus
no
tax.
add
the
element
of
interstate
commerce,
taxation
of
labor
and
overhead.
eliminate
that
element
of
tax
--
of
interstate
movement,
no
taxation
of
labor
and
overhead.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
at
the
earlier
argument
of
this
case
suggested
the
hypothet
of
the
do-it-yourself
radio
parts
kit.
our
14-year-old
boy,
i
send
him
to
a
camp
in
south
louisiana,
going
through
new
orleans,
he
saved
up
$50.
he
buys
a
do-it-yourself
kit
of
radio
parts.
he
takes
it
to
camp.
he
finds
that
the
job
of
sticking
it
together
is
too
complex
and
having
some
extra
money
from
some
source,
he
hires
the
more
sophisticated
boy
in
the
next
tent
to
put
it
together
and
he
pays
him
a
$150
for
labor
to
put
that
together.
he
brings
it
home.
he
hasn't
been
out
of
the
state.
he's
got
a
finished
radio,
$50
in
materials,
$100
in
labor,
$150
total
cost.
there
has
been
a
louisiana
sales
tax
on
the
materials,
no
sales
or
use
tax
on
the
labor
and
overhead.
change
the
facts.
inject
one
new
ingredient
only
enabling
interstate
commerce
that
they
sent
him
camp
on
the
maryland
coast.
on
a
route
through
washington,
he
goes
to
(inaudible)
and
he
buys
the
same
kit
radio
parts.
he
takes
them
to
the
camp
on
the
maryland
coast.
again,
it's
too
complex
a
job
for
him.
he
can't
put
them
together.
again,
there's
a
more
clever
boy
in
the
next
tent.
that
$100
he
had
to
put
the
radio
kit
or
parts
together.
now,
he's
got
a
$150
radio,
the
same
radio,
the
same
$50
in
materials,
the
same
$100
in
labor
and
overhead.
through
channels
of
interstate
commerce,
he
takes
that
finished
radio
back
to
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
state
of
louisiana
would
put
a
tax
on
a
$150.
it
would
include
the
labor
and
overhead
because
of
the
interstate
movement
whereas
it
excluded
it
where
there
was
no
interstate
movement.
the
sabine
river
is
a
small
stream
running
between
louisiana
and
texas.
suppose
that
i
go
to
sears
roebuck
in
new
orleans.
for
$500
i
buy
a
kit
of
radio
--
boat
parts.
i'm
going
to
be
build
a
16-foot
boat.
$500
i
buy
the
kit
or
parts,
do-it-yourself.
i
take
them
to
the
sabine
river
and
on
a
sandbank
on
the
louisiana
side,
i'll
hire
a
workman
for
$1000
to
stick
those
parts
together.
i've
got
a
finished
boat,
cost
me
a
$150
--
$1500,
i
beg
your
pardon,
$500
materials,
$1000
labor
and
overhead.
there's
been
a
louisiana
tax
on
the
materials
cost
only,
none
on
the
labor
and
overhead.
but
suppose
there's
no
sandbank
on
the
louisiana
side
and
suppose
i
take
those
same
parts,
$500
worth
of
materials
to
the
texas
side
of
this
narrow
stream.
there,
i
hire
a
workman
for
$1000
to
stick
them
together
for
me.
when
he
finishes,
i've
got
a
$1500
boat,
$500
materials,
$1000
labor
and
overhead.
now,
note
the
instance
that
taxation
is
going
to
fall
on
my
next
step.
what
is
my
next
step?
i
float
it
across
the
stream
and
upon
the
floating
of
that
thing
across
the
imperceptible
line
which
is
the
boundary
line
of
the
states,
the
collector
of
louisiana
would
fix
the
instance
of
a
tax.
he
would
tax
$1500
there
instead
of
$500
because
there
has
been
interstate
movement.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
no,
sir.
for
this
reason
and
your
honor
has
put
his
finger
on
the
most
confusing
aspect
of
this
case
and
upon
the
contention
upon
which
the
louisiana
supreme
court
stumble
in
its
reasoning.
if
you
have
--
if
halliburton
were
a
multistate
operator
which
purchased
this
equipment
outside
the
state
and
then
moved
into
louisiana,
its
tax
would
be
exactly
to
that
same
--
the
same
as
it
would
be
if
it
were
an
intrastate
purchaser
who
purchased
the
equipment
and
then
went
ahead
and
used
it.
in
each
case,
where
there
has
been
a
purchase
with
or
without
the
element
of
interstate
commerce
end,
the
tax
would
fall
on
the
purchase
price
or
cost
price
which
would
include
three
elements,
a
--
(1)
rather,
materials,
(2)
labor
and
overhead
and
(3),
the
cost
--
the
profit
of
the
producer
or
distributor.
now,
let's
--
halliburton
purchased
in
oklahoma
and
brought
it
into
louisiana,
the
tax
would
be
on
the
purchase
price.
if
it
purchased
it
in
louisiana,
the
tax
would
be
on
the
purchase
price,
there
would
be
no
differential.
on
the
other
hand,
and
this
is
what
i
--
if
i
can't
lay
anything
else
to
rest
here
today,
i
want
to
lay
to
address
the
proposition
that
you
--
that
they
have
collected
--
i
want
to
assert
clearly
that
the
collector
is
trying
to
compare
two
different
economic
operations.
guess
what
he
says?
isn't
the
use
tax,
and
this
is
going
be
his
argument,
the
use
tax
here
if
levied
upon
halliburton's
total
cost
including
labor
and
overhead
merely
the
same
as
and
no
greater
than
the
sales
tax
that
would
fall
upon
an
intrastate,
intra-louisiana
operator
who
buys
such
equipment
in
louisiana.
and
the
answer
to
that
question
necessarily
is
yes.
but
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
totally
beside
the
point.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
it
stipulated
that
we
don't
have
it,
sir.
the
stipulation
specifically
and
i
quote
it
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
it
would
have
no
effect
upon
sales
of
automobiles.
it
would
apply
in
a
particular
case
which
might
rarely
occur
if
general
motors
brought
to
louisiana
as
general
motors
and
used
as
general
motors
a
company
car.
in
other
words,
this
applies
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
--
only
to
a
manufacturer
using
its
own
product
after
having
brought
it
across
state
line.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
and
this
would
--
the
argument
there
would
be
that
if
general
motors
will
say
as
a
ford
automobile
has
got
a
$1000
of
materials
and
$2000
of
labor
over
--
and
overhead.
and
if
they
brought
that
into
louisiana,
we
assert
that
louisiana
should
not
tax
general
motors
any
more
than
if
it
had
its
manufacturing
shops
in
louisiana.
halliburton
--
the
collector
makes
a
really
incredible
argument
which
i
want
to
quote
to
this
court.
suppose
i
go
back
just
a
little
if
your
honor
would
permit
me
to.
it's
stipulated
in
this
case
that
an
intrastate
production
shop
owner,
that
is
halliburton
if
it
had
its
shops
in
louisiana
would
not
be
either
sales
tax
or
use
tax
on
this
labor
and
overhead
which
is
two-thirds
of
its
cost.
such
an
intrastate
manufacturer
use
them
would
be
a
sales
tax
of
2%
on
the
materials
it
buys,
cost
element
number
one,
but
co
--
but
the
intrastate
manufacturer-user
would
not
be
a
2%
tax
sales
or
use
on
purely
intrastate
labor
and
overhead
which
we've
called
cost
element
number
two
which
is
consumed
in
assembling
materials
into
a
usable
finished
product.
it
is
stipulated.
louisiana
does
not
levy
a
sales
tax
or
use
tax
on
intrastate
labor
and
overhead.
and
we
quote
that
stipulation
which
appears
in
the
record
at
page
26,
“if
halliburton
had
operated
at
a
location
within
the
state
of
louisiana,
there
would've
been
no
louisiana
sales
tax
or
use
tax
due
upon
the
labor
and
overhead,
and
as
--
our
position
is
simply
this,
that
the
additional
element
of
interstate
commerce
cannot
constitutionally
generate
a
new
burden
for
halliburton
which
would
not
exist
in
the
absence
of
interstate
commerce.
now,
it's
a
fact
that
halliburton
has
already
paid
to
louisiana
a
2%
use
tax
on
the
cost
of
materials,
element
number
one.
in
other
words,
halliburton
has
already
paid
to
the
state
of
louisiana
all
of
the
tax
that
a
competing
intrastate
manufacturer-user
would
be
required
to
pay
and
that's
stipulated.
the
remaining
question
is
whether
louisiana
may
require
halliburton
to
pay
a
2%
use
tax
on
the
labor
and
overhead
cost
when
incurred
in
oklahoma
which
you
would
not
be
required
to
pay
if
louisiana
had
incurred,
if
halliburton
had
incurred
the
same
labor
and
overhead
cost
in
louisiana.
we
stated,
may
louisiana
include
in
the
tax
base
of
the
multistate
or
interstate
manufacturer-user
a
substantial
element
of
cost,
two-thirds
or
about
a
million
and
half
dollars
in
this
case
while
at
the
same
time
louisiana
excludes
that
same
substantial
element
of
cost,
two-thirds
from
the
tax
base
of
the
competing
intrastate
manufacturer-user.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
all
of
my
materials
are,
sir.
now,
this
issue
has
been
under
discussion
in
one
form
or
another
in
my
memory
for
at
least
15
years.
this
is
the
first
time
it's
coming
to
litigation.
actually,
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
--
if
you
put
--
if
you
press
me
sir,
i
believe
that
the
use
tax
came
into
effect
in
the
mid-30s
but
i
would
be
uncertain
to
that
and
i
don't
think
there's
many
substantial
changes
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
correct,
sir.
actually,
you
--
my
interest
to
the
court
is
to
why
this
issue
hasn't
reached
this
court
before.
and
the
answer
is
that
every
time
the
issues
caught
up
anywhere
has
been
resolved
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
in
oklahoma
and
california,
the
statute
has
been
construed.
these
cases
in
our
briefs
had
been
construed
to
eliminate
from
the
tax
base
of
the
use
tax,
any
element
which
was
eliminated
from
the
tax
base
of
the
interstate
--
intrastate
sales
tax.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
that
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
my
experience
frankly
is
limited
to
this
case
which
has
been
in
argument
since
about
1955.
we
refuse
to
pay
it.
i
really
don't
know
how
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
i
don't
have
knowledge
of
--
perhaps
they
--
the
collector
may
have
been
yielding
on
the
point
before
perhaps
the
tax
base
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
sir?
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
i
think
we
paid
it
in
1956,
sir.
they
--
one
of
the
fascinating
things
--
have
i
answered
your
question
sir?
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
the
issue
has
arisen
once
before
in
alabama.
this
case
has
another
facet
which
we
--
we've
been
talking
about
the
labor
and
overhead
phase.
now,
let
me
slip
over
very
briefly
into
another
phase
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
37
states
have
sales
and
use
taxes
and
they
account
for
about
20%
of
the
combined
revenue
of
all
states.
now,
it's
my
observation
that
this
--
that
the
tax
drafters
of
these
statutes
have
tended
to
copy
from
each
other.
now,
how
many
of
them
are
exactly
like
this,
i
can't
say.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
every
time
the
issue
has
ever
arisen
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
--
it
has
been
held
the
way
we
are
contending
for.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes,
sir
but
i
can
give
it
to
you.
i
have
it
right
here.
i
can
--
alabama
is
the
only
state
where
it's
been
litigated.
in
ohio
and
california
and
then
oklahoma,
it's
been
administrated
--
administratively
determined.
oklahoma
had
a
--
in
three
states
including
ohio
and
i
can't
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
no,
sir.
with
much
respect
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
--
i
think
to
the
contrary.
in
north
dakota,
ohio,
and
california,
it's
been
administratively
ruled.
this
appears
in
our
--
page
46
of
our
brief
that
wherever
the
labor
--
that
the
labor
and
shop
overhead
must
be
excluded
from
the
use
tax
since
it
is
excluded
from
the
sales
tax.
and
they
point
to
the
constitutional
necessity
for
so
holding.
now,
the
state
of
alabama
specifically
had
these
questions
squarely
in
litigation
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held
exactly
almost
in
words
of
one
syllable
as
we
are
contending
that
the
court
should
hold
today.
the
--
in
alabama,
the
issue
dealt
with
what
we
called
the
isolated
sales
exemption
in
the
use
tax.
if
i
were
to
sell
this
necktie
in
louisiana,
since
i
am
not
regularly
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
neckties,
there
is
no
sales
tax
on
that
transaction.
there
is
an
exemption
of
isolated
sales.
but
the
collector
of
revenue
says
that
there
is
no
--
and
this
is
the
alabama
case,
i'm
coming
to
your
point
but
i
think
its
much
better
illustrated
with
this
if
you
please,
sir.
they
had
barges
in
the
alabama
case
instead
of
a
necktie
but
i
think
this
gets
the
point
more
rapidly.
if
i
were
to
sell
this
to
opposing
counsel,
if
i
had
sold
it
to
him
in
louisiana,
and
then
he
brought
it
up
here
and
taking
it
back
to
louisiana,
there
would
be
no
sales
tax
on
the
transaction
because
the
operative
facts,
my
sale
of
it
to
him
took
place
within
louisiana's
barge.
but
if,
i
should
initiate
that
transaction
right
here
today,
if
i
should
take
it
off
and
sell
it
to
him
for
a
dollar,
and
if
he
took
that
thing
back
into
louisiana
so
that
the
sale
took
place
here,
and
the
use
took
place
in
louisiana,
then
louisiana
would
demand
a
2%
use
tax
on
that
because
they
say
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
isolated
use.
specifically,
in
the
halliburton
case,
halliburton
bought
an
airplane
in
new
york
from
a
newspaper
company
that
wasn't
in
the
business
of
selling
such
things.
they
had
bought
some
used
equipment
from
a
company
in
texas
that
was
not
regularly
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
such
equipment
and
they
brought
them
into
louisiana.
and
louisiana
said,
“because
you've
moved
these
things
in
interstate
commerce,
because
you
went
outside
the
louisiana
marketplace
to
get
these
things
instead
of
getting
in
louisiana,
we
want
you
to
pay
a
2%
use
tax”.
with
reference
to
the
airplane,
if
they
--
that
airplane
have
been
flown
by
the
vendor,
not
by
halliburton
into
the
morrison
airport
in
new
orleans
and
if
there,
it
had
been
purchased
by
halliburton,
then
there
would've
been
no
louisiana
sales
tax
on
the
transaction.
but
if
halliburton
goes
outside
the
state
and
gets
that
piece
of
equipment
and
then
flies
it
in,
louisiana
would
place
a
tax
upon
it.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
know
of
no
holding
anywhere
nor
any
published
writing
anywhere
that
supports
the
louisiana
collector
except
one
article
in
the
louisiana
law
review
by
one
robert
roland
who
if
the
court
should
find
that,
i
call
this
attention
that
mr.
robert
roland
was
the
attorney,
was
the
louisiana
collector
himself
at
the
time
that
this
thing
was
done.
in
another
article
in
the
louisiana
law
review
where
the
law
review
is
taking
the
point
different
from
mr.
roland,
we
are
supporting
it.
the
only
written
word
in
print
that
supports
us
is
mr.
roland's
proposition.
this
issue
and
one
thing
i
must
have
the
court
here
is
an
incredible
argument
of
the
louisiana
collector
in
his
motion
to
dismiss.
it's
a
fascination
to
see
what
he
says.louisiana
collector
says
that
for
halliburton
this
is
and
we
quote
from
the
motion
to
dismiss
at
page
13,
“not
an
interstate
problem,
not
an
interstate
commerce
problem
but
a
problem
in
management
in
locating
its
operations
so
as
to
reduce
its
cost
of
operations”.
the
taxpayer
says,
the
louisiana
collector
may
reduce
his
tax
burden
by
manufacturing
equipment
within
louisiana
for
his
own
use.
collector's
argument
is
incredible.
he
contends
that
louisiana's
position
that
non
--
it
is
nondiscriminatory
simultaneously
he
argues
it
by
a
good
corporate
management,
halliburton
could
avoid
this
louisiana
tax
by
ceasing
its
interstate
movement
and
becoming
a
purely
intrastate
operator
having
its
entire
operation
within
louisiana's
borders.
we've
discussed
this
point
in
our
brief
at
some
length
under
the
heading,
a
problem
of
management,
save
louisiana
taxes
by
manufacturing
in
louisiana.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
right.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
because
otherwise
there's
a
2%
tax
inducement
by
the
state
of
louisiana
to
coax
the
manufacturer
into
the
state
of
louisiana
and
that's
what
we
think
that
the
federal
constitution
forbids.
this
issue
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
oh,
oh
no,
sir.
there
was
no
tax
paid
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
because
there's
an
exception
of
goods
produced
by
export.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
but
note
that
if
there'd
been
only
a
tax
on
the
materials
in
oklahoma
because
there
was
no
intra-oklahoma
labor
and
overhead
tax,
then
when
they
came
to
the
state
of
louisiana,
they
could
claim
a
credit
only
for
the
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
taylor,
jr.
--
materials
tax
that
had
been
paid
and
louisiana
again
would
flag
them
down
and
say,
“give
us
the
tax
on
this
labor
and
overhead
because
you've
got
them
multistate
operation”.
the
use
tax
falls
only
on
goods
that
had
been
moved
interstate
commerce.
henneford
versus
silas
mason,
1936
before
this
court,
the
use
tax
was
attacked
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
be
offensive
to
the
interstate
commerce
clause
because
it
only
falls
upon
situations
where
there's
been
an
interstate
movement.
the
use
tax
is
upheld
in
that
case
despite
the
fact
that
the
use
tax
only
falls
upon
transactions
involving
in
interstate
commerce
because
in
a
case
then
at
bar,
silas
mason,
the
use
tax
of
the
state
of
washington
did
not
exceed
the
sales
tax
of
the
same
state
but
was
merely
complimentary
to
and
precisely
equal
to
the
sales
tax
of
the
same
state
therefore
there
was
no
discrimination,
hence
no
unconstitutionality.
and
mr.
justice
cardozo
made
it
plain
that
that
was
his
rationale
with
this
language.
equality,
he
says,
is
a
theme
that
runs
through
all
sections
of
the
washington
statute.
when
the
account
is
made
up,
to
stretch
him
afar
is
subject
to
no
greater
burdens
than
the
dweller
within
the
gates.
in
each
situation,
the
burden
of
the
use
tax
is
balanced
by
an
equal
burden
of
the
sales
tax
where
the
sale
is
strictly
lawful.
and
mr.
justice
cardozo
concluded
a
nondiscriminatory
tax,
a
nondiscriminatory
tax
has
never
been
regarded
as
imposing
a
direct
burden
upon
the
interstate
commerce.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
implicit
in
the
silas
mason
decision
and
corrected
so,
is
the
proposition
that
whenever
the
use
tax,
the
interstate
tax
does
exceed
the
intrastate
tax
in
an
identical
situation,
not
comparing
a
manufacturer-user,
with
the
purchaser
at
