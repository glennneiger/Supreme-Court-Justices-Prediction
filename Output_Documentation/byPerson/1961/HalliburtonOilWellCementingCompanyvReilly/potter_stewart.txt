whatâ€™s
that,
the
stipulations?
justice

mr.
sanford,
mr.
justice
black
asked
you,
what
would
be
the
case
if
halliburton
had
purchased
this
equipment
in
oklahoma
from
another
manufacturer
and
you
say
the
tax
would
be
identical,
is
that
quite
right?
i
thought
the
tax
then
would
be
measured
by
the
price,
the
purchase
price?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

purchased
and
brought
in,
thought
it
was
new,
it
would
be
the
purchase
price.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
measured
by
the
price.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
wouldn't
go
in
all
of
these
formulas
you've
gone
into
with
--
in
this
case
because
price
would
also
include
a
profit,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
those
cases
at
least
that
you've
--
so
wouldn't
be
the
same,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
had
it
been
purchased
from
another
manufacturer
in
oklahoma.
that
was
mr.
justice
black's
hypothetical
case
justice
potter
stewart
here,
it
was
manufactured
by
halliburton
in
oklahoma,
wasn't
it?
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
none
of
that,
as
a
matter
of
that,
as
in
this
case,
either
by
stipulation
or
evidence
or
anything
else,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
none
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
(inaudible).
if
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
person
is
resident
or
non-resident
of
the
state,
does
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
applies
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
question
would
arise
if
a
citizen
and
resident
of
louisiana
who
had
live
there
all
his
life
whether
he'd
be
an
individual
person
or
corporation,
went
to
oklahoma
and
manufactured
some
for
his
own
use
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
has
nothing
to
do
with
residence
in
or
outside
the
state,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
applicable
to
me,
traveling
and
being
in
louisiana
a
day,
staying
on
a
hotel
room
or
it's
applicable
to
somebody
who'd
lived
there
for
75
years,
we're
not
talking
residency
or
domicile
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
the
administrative
practice
of
these
other
states
is
against
you
too?
justice
potter
stewart
ohio
and
california?
justice
potter
stewart
offer
credit.
justice
potter
stewart
we
can't
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
on
its
construction
of
the
louisiana
statute.
we're
--
we
take
--
we
had
to
take
that
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
starts
with
the
statute
just
as
though
that's
what
the
statute
explicitly
and
unambiguously
said.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
