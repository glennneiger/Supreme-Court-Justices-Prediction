justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
terms
of
the
statute
defining
the
virtues
upon
whom
a
use
tax
could
be
levied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
statute,
the
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
first
use
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
if
i
travel
from
texas
--
if
i
buy
something
in
texas,
and
by
car,
go
into
louisiana,
to
louisiana
and
then
out
of
louisiana,
not
a
record
under
louisiana
and
use
something
that
i
bought
or
opened
the
package
that
i
bought
in
texas
just
as
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
fugitive
passing
there
through?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
what
is
the
--
what
are
the
terms
of
the
statute?
how
do
i
know
whether
it
goes
that
far
enough?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
the
--
the
--
it
must
be
all
--
the
use
must
be
exhausted
within
the
state,
is
that
right?
there
must
be
a
used,
consumed,
distributed
or
stored
to
use
or
consumption
in
the
state
if
i
buy
some
food
in
texas
and
then
eat
it
in
louisiana,
is
there
a
use
tax
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
put
them
on
--
buying
in
texas,
i
put
them
on
in
--
to
louisiana
--
driving
through
louisiana
out
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
would
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
suppose
i
buy
that
pair
of
shoes
in
texas
and
there
is
a
nice
box
and
i
keep
it
in
the
box
--
that
would
not
be
in
it
because
it
isn't
used,
consumed,
distributed
or
stored
for
use.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
stored
for
use.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
will
be
subject
to
the
use
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
every
--
bringing
into
the
state
of
louisiana,
anything
from
without,
even
for
the
most
fugitive
persons
in
the
state
is
subject
to
the
use
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
now
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
before
you
go
into
cases
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
would
be
greatly
helped
if
you'd
tell
us
exactly
what
are
the
controlling
--
what
are
the
real
--
the
actual
detailed
facts
in
this
case
so
i
wouldn't
be
considering
a
lot
of
abstract
talk
and
decisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
all
of
this
--
all
of
manufacturing
is
done
in
oklahoma?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
say
is
two-thirds?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
i
let
you
do
that
if
you'll
permit
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
get
all
the
facts
are
relevant
to
the
legal
question
before
i
have
to
make
up
my
mind,
look
at
the
henneford
case
and
this
case
and
some
other
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
--
i
want
to
know
a
few
more
facts.
halliburton
is
probably
receptive
if
the
corporation
--
what's
it?
duncan
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
doing
business
in
louisiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it’s
a
foreign
corporation
domesticated
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
louisiana.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
happens?
do
know
anything
more
not
to
delay
you
longer
but
your
eagerness
to
get
to
the
discussion
of
law.
when
this
truck
--
when
this
truck
comes
in,
they
then
levy
this
use
tax
on
--
on
the
value
of
what
is
on
that
truck,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
if
one
had
been
--
if
one
had
been
--
somebody
had
bought
it,
not
the
manufacturer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
lessor
--
halliburton
is
the
lessor
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
you
call
it.
now
the
same
kind
of
--
suppose
the
same
interruption,
i
don’t
mean
to
be
disrespectful,
but
the
same
mechanism,
device
is
put
together
in
louisiana
by
some
rival
of
yours,
what
tax
would
it
be
subject
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
excluding
all
the
labor
and
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
before
you
go
to
the
cases,
i
don’t
mean
to
direct
your
argument
mr.
taylor,
what
is
your,
forget
the
cases
for
a
moment,
what
is
your
legal
proposition
which
you
tender
to
this
court
regarding
louisiana’s
exerted
taxing
power
in
reference
to
you
and
what
is
your
view
with
the
taxing
power
she
does
have
over
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
further
ready
to
pay
the
equivalent
--
the
amount
of
the
sales
tax
would
be
on
this
aggregate
if
brought
in
by
resident
louisianan
or
manufactured
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
we
have
to
bother
about
sales
tax?
the
state
isn't
impo
--
trying
to
impose
a
sales
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
isn't
trying
to
impose
a
sales
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you’re
saying
--
what
you're
arguing
in
effect
you're
saying
it
is
that
since
there's
an
equivalent
as
to
local
people
and
as
to
local
manufacturer
and
as
to
local
use,
the
same
equivalents
must
pertain
to
this
situation,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
means
that
that
--
that
the
choice
to
give
you
is
to
pay
this
or
move
from
oklahoma
to
louisiana.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
take
care
of
a
lot
of
commerce
problems,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
a
use
tax,
merely
a
use
tax,
no
sales
tax
at
all,
would
be
stricken
down
as
to
interstate
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
that
--
i
don't
quite
--
in
the
nature
of
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
it
pick
out
these
particular
commodities
not
by
name
of
course
or
description,
but
could
it
pick
out
a
class
of
commodity,
the
incident
of
which
is
relevantly
limited?
a
state
cannot
pass
a
sales
tax
on
everything,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
qualifications
and
exceptions,
are
they
not
all
over
the
place
in
all
the
sales
tax,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
to
use
tax
for
sale,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
could
it
pick
out
for
purposes
of
a
use
tax
particular
kind
of
hardware,
without
infringing
upon
such
capriciousness
whatever
that
maybe,
but
the
classification
itself
is
not
agreed
for
protection
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
question
that
i
put
bunglingly
is
whether
the
subject
matter
is
such
that
you
are
comparing
pomegranates
with
pineapple
with
tomatoes,
could
a
state
say,
"we
only
have
sale
taxes
on
vegetables
and
not
on
fruits",
or
"sales
tax
on
fruit
and
not
on
vegetable",
and
vice-versa?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
could
it
restrict
it
to
the
kind
of
things
to
be
as
neutral
as
that,
as
halliburton
people
bring
in?
so
long
as
it
doesn't
say
only
stuff
brought
in
but
have
a
classification
of
things
whoever
falls
within
that
category
is
subject
to
the
sale
tax
as
well
as
the
use
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
alone
in
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
its
application
may
it
not
apply
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
would
make
of
this
country
an
uncommon
market?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
citation
of
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
its
bay
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
towing
company
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
weren't
sold
but
the
services
afforded
to
contract
because
i
understand
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
truck,
this
contraption
or
this
combination
of
things
isn't
sold
in
louisiana,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
transaction
in
your
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
what
is
--
on
what
are
you
imposing
a
sales
or
use
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
exactly
the
same
transaction
took
place
entirely
within
louisiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
dollars
and
cents
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
just
tell
in
terms
of
dollar
and
cents,
what
you
do
to
this
or
what
you
seek
to
do
or
have
done
on
the
protest,
what
the
use
tax
amounts
to
in
dollars
and
cents
that
justice
black
asked
on
what
it
is,
what
the
basis
of
it
is,
because
it
came
in
from
oklahoma
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
has
compared
it
exactly
the
same
thing
had
been
done,
the
same
arrangement,
the
same
contractual
arrangement
or
whatever
it
was
wholly
playing
its
role,
this
inanimate
role
in
louisiana.
have
i
made
my
question
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
i've
stated
it
clearly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
about
that.
but
i
--
i'm
still
maybe
to
my
own
comprehension
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
having
yet
gone
--
what
it
is
on
what
you
seek
to
assess
the
use
tax
as
this
organic
whole,
as
this
composite
thing
comes
in
and
would
you
be
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
if
it
had
all
been
done
in
louisiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
before
you
go
unto
details,
tell
me
that
the
results
in
dollars
and
cents
would
be
exactly
the
same
whether
it
was
brought
in
from
oklahoma
or
it
was
all
done
in
louisiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
fellow
in
louisiana
buys
this
$100
worth
of
lumber
and
makes
a
desk
and
sells
it
for
$500,
what
is
he
taxed
off?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
whether
the
desk
or
something
else,
instead
of
being
sold,
it's
left.
suppose
use
tax
on
linen
in
louisiana,
use
tax
on
linen,
sales
of
linen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
suppose
of
--
i
see
these
(inaudible)
or
whatever
they're
called
that
lease
or
laundry
service,
merely
the
use
of
linen,
you
tax
that
in
louisiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
rental
tax.
and
the
rental
tax
of
linen
brought
in,
in
combination
from
outside
of
state
with
the
same
as
the
rental
tax
within?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
same
transaction,
i'm
trying
to
understand
whether
this
service
that
halliburton
offers
are
not
selling
this
combination
of
products,
but
merely
giving
its
service,
is
there
anything
comparable
to
that
that
this
tax
at
the
same
rate
--if
the
rate
isn't
enough
that
you
can
have
the
same
rate
and
still
have
one
rabbit
and
one
horse
situation.
if
it's
the
same
situation,
is
there
anything
--
any
analogy
to
this
service
of
halliburton
is
rendering
by
stuff
brought
in
from
oklahoma,
does
anything
like
that
take
place
in
louisiana
when
--
or
everything
takes
place
in
louisiana
with
which
you
can
compare
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
all
this
took
place
hypothetically
in
louisiana,
what
would
happen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
done
here,
is
it?
here,
you
impose
a
use
tax
on
the
value
of
--
as
though,
it
was
sold,
as
though
the
entirety
was
sold.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
was
all
done
in
louisiana,
it
would
be
merely
tax
on
the
basis
of
a
part,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
that's
the
case
we've
got,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
we
to
do
with
it?
we've
got
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
that
--
of
the
case
though.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
isn't
--
they
may
not
be
here
but
the
answer
you've
given
me
if
i
understood
that
it
showed
discrimination
that
if
it
were
all
done
within
louisiana
hypothetically,
then
you'd
only
tax
on
the
basis
of
the
parts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
i
follow
you
but
that's
a
totally
different
line
of
argument
instead
of
saying
they're
equal.
what
you're
saying
is
now
is
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you've
got
to
take
the
entirety
of
the
tax
structure
of
a
state
and
the
internal
seller,
the
local
seller
not
only
pays
that
sales
tax,
he
pays
a
lot
of
other
things.
and
therefore,
you
could
differentiate
at
your
argument
because
the
out-of-towner
is
immune
from
those
things
to
which
he
would
be
subjected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means
to
become
a
massive,
part
of
the
massive
property
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
but
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
the
phrase
but
i
don't
see
its
application.
justice
felix
frankfurter
drawn
what
has
happened
here,
they
come
in
from
outside
into
the
state
and
then
they've
merely
concluded
their
interstate
transaction
which
if
it
be
that
and
nothing
else
is
immune
from
state
taxation,
except
to
the
limited
extent
that
you
can
cut
off
some
local
activities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
and
they're
put
on
the
shelf
and
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
could
be
--
put
part
of
the
mass
--
becoming
part
of
the
massive
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
tax
them
before
they're
put
on
the
shelf.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
the
qualification
is
concealed
or
rather
covered
by
your
freight.
if
in
use
there
and
the
question
of
the
case
as
i
see
it
is
what
the
--
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
what
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
used
tax,
the
incidence
of
this
tax
--
let
me
ask
you
this,
is
the
incidence
of
this
tax
is
what
it
means
to
halliburton
in
dollars
and
cents
the
same
as
though
they
brought
this
stuff
in
and
sold
it
to
the
owners
of
oil
well
instead
of
giving
the
service
on
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
though
they
have
sold
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
but
in
--
and
therefore,
the
sale
of
the
same
combined
aggregation
of
things
if
sold
in
louisiana
would
be
subject
to
the
same
tax,
the
same
rate
on
the
same
basis,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
i
want
to
--
what
troubles
me
is
that
i
don't
quite
understand
but
you
can
say
you
treat
it
as
though
there
was
a
sale
in
louisiana
when
there
wasn't
a
sale.
and
i
want
to
know
what
the
comparable
thing
to
that
kind
of
an
arrangement
is
in
louisiana
with
reference
exclusively
to
louisiana
factors
or
can't
you
compare
them?
isn't
there
any
such
thing
in
louisiana
as
the
rental
of
this
kind
of
equipment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
not
a
sale
in
louisiana.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
a
--
it's
a
use
tax
based
on
the
value
of
something
that's
rented,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
don't
sell
this,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
effect,
doesn't
sell
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
rents
it
to
someone
else.
well
i
don't
think
they
even
rent
it
your
honor,
they
use
it
themselves
because
i
don't
believe
they
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
they
are
in
business
there.
they
put
it
on
--
people
call
in
and
say,
"we
need
some
cement."
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
alright,
take
that
situation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
that
--
take
the
same
thing
in
louisiana,
a
local
contractor
using
the
same
equipment,
what
kind
of
a
tax
do
you
impose
on
him
for
the
use
of
that
equipment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
for
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
total
--
not
for
the
total
aggregate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
so
here,
you're
imposing
an
exemption
on
the
aggregate
when
you
do
not
do
it
to
the
comparable
aggregate
in
louisiana,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it
can't
exist,
can't
be
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
assuming
--
please
correct
me
or
change
me,
i'm
assuming
that
halliburton
has
a
place
in
louisiana.
they
transfer,
they
listen
to
your
apparent
call
and
come
over,
put
up
their
shop
there,
build
all
these
things
and
do
the
exactly
the
same
thing
with
reference
to
the
oil
well.
what
would
they
be
taxed
on,
on
what
they
purchased
of
the
component
parts
of
the
total,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
what
the
aggregate
is
worth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
and
your
--
then
the
--
the
arithmetic
is
not
an
equation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
i've
been
trying
to
get
into
my
head
and
now
understand
your
justifications.
the
justification
that
you've
given,
i
do
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely
that
if
they
were
residents
in
louisiana
then
they'd
be
subject
to
some
other
tax
as
i
understand
that.
that's
a
very
different
defense
and
to
say
that
the
sales
tax
equals
the
use
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you've
made
that
point
which
is
a
very
important
one
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
are
very
different
things
and
you
make
it
because
they're
not
comparable.
and
one
of
the
points
about
the
commerce
clause
is
that
i
have
a
right
to
go
outside
the
state
and
get
certain
advantages
by
coming
across
the
borders.
that's
the
point
about
the
commerce
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
the
accident
is
that
it's
across
state
line,
that's
the
accident.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
taxing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
same
items.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
isn't
--
but
that
--
that
isn't
the
end
of
the
matter,
because
you're
saying
in
one
case
you
taxed
for
sales
of
an
organic
of
a
completed
thing.
and
the
other
thing
you
taxed
for
sales
of
item
with
which
i
can
do
what
i
pleased
by
--
could
destroy
them,
to
eat
them
if
they're
edible,
to
leave
them
by
around
loops,
or
make
a
contraption
of
my
own,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you're
comparing
two
different
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you're
taxing
the
sales
of
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
thing
to
compare
the
sale
of
a
radio
or
of
a
tv
set
is
another
thing
to
compare
the
sale
of
the
individual
item
with
which
on
--
had
liberty
to
do
what
i
damn
please.
but
that
isn't
--
you
don't
--
therefore,
you
say
you
compare
what
one
fellow
buys,
item
one,
two,
three
with
the
imposition
of
a
tax
on
what
is
made
out
of
one,
two,
three,
and
they're
very
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
same
fellow
who
bought
--
the
rival
assuming,
there
was
a
rival,
maybe
this
was
too
hypothetical
a
case,
to
a
sale
the
statute
on,
of
the
facts
on.
but
the
rival
in
louisiana,
if
he
does
everything
that
halliburton
did
in
oklahoma
would
not
be
subjected
to
the
kind
of
tax,
leave
out
on
account,
all
of
the
taxes
in
louisiana.
he
would
not
be
subjected
to
the
kind
of
tax
namely
the
value
of
the
parts
put
together
treated
as
a
whole
as
though
it
was
sold,
is
that
right?
i
--
i'm
not
drawing
an
inference
on
it.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
that's
right,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
now,
suppose
it's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
however,
i'm
--
that
therefore,
i'm
not
saying
that
this
has
answered
the
problem,
but
the
fact
therefore
is
that
the
advantage
of
having
an
allegedly
free
market
between
states
would
put
that
fellow
who
does
all
this
in
part
in
oklahoma,
and
then
comes
into
louisiana
at
a
disadvantage
because
he
did
it
in
oklahoma
instead
of
in
louisiana.
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
constitutionally
bad.
i'm
just
saying
that
that's
the
result,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
regard
to
any
other
taxes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he's
being
a
citizen
of
united
states
you
mean,
which
the
whole
point
is
that
you
got
to
--
suppose
it
be
a
free
market
that
he's
entitled.
the
question
is
whether
he's
entitled
to
that
event,
what
you
call
accident
(inaudible)--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
reaching
a
legal
conclusion.
i'm
trying
to
understand
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
very
properly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
very
properly
without
regard
to
any
other
taxes
because
i'm
very
receptive
to
that
line
of
consideration
which
had
been
sought
to
be
brushed
aside.
it's
very
important
in
these
matters.
namely,
that
you've
got
to
consider
a
tax
in
relation
to
the
whole
tax
structure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wanted
to
isolate
the
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
not
getting
confused
with
a
lot
of
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
deal
with
this
question
because
i
thought
you've
yield
at
a
little
(inaudible)
until
your
last
remarks
with
justice
harlan's
suggestion.
this
is
the
question
of
the
tax
structure
is
irrelevant
because
you're
authorized
to
do
business
in
louisiana.
that
is,
it's
irrelevant
only
for
two
basis
of
taxation
between
a
domestic
domiciliary,
domiciliary
corporation
and
an
authorized
corporation
are
the
same
which
i
take
is
they're
not,
are
they?
the
taxes
that
a
domestic
corporation
pays
and
that
of
a
corporation
or
upon
corporation
pays,
they're
not
the
same,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
be
very
strange,
louisiana
would
be
quite
alone
if
it
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
considerations
like
that
had
been
used
in
tax
cases,
i'm
not
sure
that
they'd
been
introduced
in
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
case
comes
here
from
a
state
and
therefore
we
can
take
judicial
notice
to
all
the
tax
laws
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
case
have
been
in
this
court
have
shed
light
on
the
problem
as
we
now
have
it
isolated
or
narrowed,
whichever
is
--
(inaudible)
suppose
in
the
questions
put
justice
harlan
recently
and
what
i
put
to
you
finally.
what
case
had
shed
most
light
on
that
problem
namely,
when
comparing
exactly
the
same
economic
incident,
the
same
economic
transaction,
there
is
a
difference
in
treatment
by
the
state
of
the
out-of-stator
and
the
in-stator.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
case
had
shed
most
light
on
that
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
that.
but
i
mean
the
point
that
you're
making
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
the
point
you're
making,
what
you
finally
have
stated
is
that
the
state
of
louisiana
has
a
right,
has
power
under
the
constitution
to
frustrate,
to
deprive
if
you
will,
to
deny
the
fellow
who
comes
in
from
the
outside
who
have
had
the
benefit
of
having
been
in
the
outside.
what's
the
--
what
decision
of
this
court
shed
any
light
on
that
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
making
that
point
but
that's
going
to
introduce
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everything
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
re
--
if
the
fellow
does
that
from
louisiana
and
goes
to
oklahoma
and
picks
up
all
these
pieces
and
then
builds
a
thing
of
his
own,
what
would
he
be
taxed
on
in
louisiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
you're
taxing
halliburton
on.
you're
taxing
him
on
the
value
of
his
aggregated
equipment.
and
the
louisianan,
would
you
tax
the
louisianan
on
its
use
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
according
to
the
sales
value
if
he's
ought
to
sell
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
was
all
made
in
louisiana,
it'd
be
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
traveling
of
the
person
whether
he's
resident
of
louisiana
or
not,
but
where
the
transaction
takes
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they'll
lend
it
to
other
people,
wouldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
--
