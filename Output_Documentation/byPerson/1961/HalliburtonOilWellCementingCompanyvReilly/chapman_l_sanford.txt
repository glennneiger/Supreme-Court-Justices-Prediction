mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
of
course
admit
that
the
constitutional
rules
applicable
to
the
questions
raised
by
halliburton
had
long
been
settled.
we
can't
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce,
we
can't
tax
interstate
commerce
but
we
feel
then
that
the
important
thing
to
show
here
is
the
operation
of
louisiana
use
and
tax
law
and
to
show
that
it
does
not
in
fact
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
but
before
giving
into
the
law
itself,
i
would
comment
briefly
on
the
stipulation
in
how
this
case
came
about.
we
of
course
stipulated
how
halliburton
operates.
they
are
an
interstate
operation
and
they
operate
with
these
trucks
which
they
manufacture
themselves
in
oklahoma.
there's
no
question,
however,
that
these
trucks
become
a
part
of
the
massive
property
in
louisiana
and
they
admit
that
of
course
because
they
are
willing
to
pay
a
tax
on
it.
they
are
saying
that
they
want
to
pay
a
tax
upon
the
cost
to
them
of
the
nuts
and
bolts
and
the
chassis
and
the
sheet
metal
that
went
into
creating
a
highly
specialized
piece
of
machinery
which
is
what
it
was
in
louisiana
the
time
that
it
came
in.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes
sir,
they
would
have
been.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
on
the
basis
of
the
sales
price,
the
price
for
which
the
truck
were
sold
would
bear
2%
tax
at
the
time
of
sale.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
in
other
words
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
as
to
what
happens
here?
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
in
this
particular
case,
we're
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
imposing
the
use
tax
upon
the
fair
market
value
as
of
the
first
moment
that
the
property
was
withdrawn
from
commerce
and
became
a
part
of
the
massive
property
in
the
state
of
louisiana
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
for
use
there.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
we
have
stipulated
your
honor.
in
other
words,
the
stipulation
are
that
we
would
not
tax
the
shop
overhead
and
labor.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
this
that
the
--
and
that
is
what
i
was
just
getting
too
incidentally.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes
sir,
i'm
just
trying
to
think
i
want
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
i
will
answer
your
question
this
way.
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we
are
arguing
this
case
as
if
--
if
halliburton
itself
were
manufacturing
this
particular
truck
in
louisiana
for
its
use
in
louisiana
at
the
time
they
had
purchased
the
component
parts
within
louisiana,
it
would
have
pay
a
2%
tax
on
the
cost
of
those
component
parts.
or
if
it
had
imported
those
component
parts
into
louisiana,
it
would
have
pay
the
use
tax
on
the
fair
market
value
across
to
those
component
parts
at
the
time
they
came
into
louisiana
for
use.
that
apparently
is
what
the
stipulation
meant
and
we
have
argued
it
that
way
here.
mr.
taylor
said
yesterday
that
we
hadn't
commented
on
the
stipulation
below,
we
did.
and
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
but
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
let
me
get
an
explanation
of
the
law
there,
at
this
time,
i
think
that
will
answer
it
to
show
how
the
law
does
work.
the
sales
tax
law
and
the
use
tax
law
and
to
show
your
honor
then
why
there
isn't
a
discrimination,
i
think
that
your
honor
will
then
understand
a
little
better
what
we
are
doing.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
not
to
halliburton.
but
what
--
i'm
going
to
show
your
honor
that
we
feel
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
and
why.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
your
honor
is
talking
about
other
states?
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
our
state
imposes
the
use
tax
on
the
value
of
the
completed
item.
we
take
the
thing
as
of
the
moment
it
becomes
a
part
of
a
massive
property
in
the
state.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
we
do
your
honor.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
think
we
can
show
this
differed.
everybody
is
treated
equally
in
this
case,
as
of
the
moment
that
we
apply
the
tax.
i
think
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
only
question
is
that
possibly
you
can
call
this
a
loophole.
i
doubt
that
it's
even
that.
and
the
--
if
the
question
is
going
to
resolve
itself
down
to
whether
or
not
a
taxpayer
who
doesn't
avail
himself
of
a
loophole
is
discriminated
against
because
they
exist
the
loophole
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
not
that
--
there's
anybody
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes,
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct
(inaudible).
the
law
isn't
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
written
exactly
that
way.
i
think
that
there
we
could
abolish
the
sales
tax
and
the
use
tax
would
apply.
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
--
i
mean
if
we
abolish
--
take
everything
out
of
the
law
pertaining
to
sales
tax,
well
then
there
would
be
a
use
tax.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
what
--
our
law
applies
like
this
and
the
basis
or
at
least
--
let's
take
the
rate
first,
the
rate
is
2%.
in
both
cases,
the
use
tax
is
2%
and
the
sales
tax
is
2%.
so
we
have
at
least
an
equality
of
the
amount
of
the
tax
we
are
charging.
and
in
the
basis
of
the
tax
in
a
sale
of
course
is
the
sales
price
and
it's
that
would
or
then
it
be
the
fair
market
value
and
it's
easily
established
in
that
case
because
a
willing
seller
and
a
willing
buyer
right
then
and
we
have
a
fair
market
value.
in
the
use
tax,
we
have
the
basis
is
the
fair
market
value.
it
may
be
a
little
hard
to
determine
but
the
basis
is
identical
to
that
of
a
sales
tax
if
a
taxpayer
can
show
that
the
fair
market
value
as
of
the
moment
it
is
withdrawn
from
commerce
to
use
in
louisiana,
if
he
can
show
a
similar
sale
for
identical
item,
well
of
course
that's
the
value
upon
which
this
2%
is
going
to
be
applied.
so
we
have
the
rate
and
the
basis
identical
and
now,
we
have
to
look
to
see
if
the
time
is
identical
and
it
is.
in
the
sales
tax,
it
is
the
sale
for
retail
and
that
of
course
is
the
first
taking
by
a
consumer
of
the
property
for
use
or
consumption
in
the
state,
and
that's
the
moment
when
the
sales
tax
applies.
and
the
use
tax
is
identical
because
the
use
tax
does
not
apply
into
a
consumer,
brings
it
in
to
the
state
for
use
or
consumption,
it
is
withdrawn
from
commerce.
and
as
of
that
moment,
the
moment
where
the
consumer
has
it
in
his
possession
in
louisiana
for
use
or
consumption
in
louisiana,
is
that
--
is
when
the
tax
applies.
and
therefore,
we
have
the
sales
tax
and
the
use
tax
with
the
same
rate,
the
same
basis
and
the
same
moment
of
taxation
and
it
applies
for
component
parts
or
completed
items.
the
fact
that
a
person
can
go
down
to
the
hardware
store
say
and
purchase
tools
and
component
parts
to
make
an
item
for
himself
at
one
rate
and
take
those
home
and
apply
his
labor
to
it
and
create
an
item
of
greater
value
than
the
component
parts,
i
don't
believe
discriminates
against
the
same
man
--
another
man
who
goes
to
the
store
and
buys
what
--
a
similar
item
to
where
it's
been
created
by
the
man
at
his
house.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
--
if
you
want
a
nice
desk
that
may
cost
$500
in
the
store,
you
go
buy
the
lumber
for
a
hundred,
you
go
home
and
you
make
a
nice
desk
for
yourself,
you'd
pay
tax
for
a
hundred.
another
man
that
buys
an
identical
desk
at
the
store
pays
$500
and
he
pays
the
tax
of
$500.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
if
it's
a
casual
sale
your
honor,
in
other
words
he's
not
in
the
business
of
selling
furniture
or
desk
or
building
desk
to
sell,
well
there
is
no
tax
because
there
is
an
exemption
for
a
casual
sale.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes,
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
we
have
a
rental
tax
your
honor.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes
sir
and
the
person
that
lets
the
linen
would
pay
a
use
tax
on
the
linen
that
he
handed.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
don't
believe
your
honor.
let
me
answer
the
question
this
way
and
i
see
if
i
understand
it.
there's
very
little
manufacture
in
louisiana,
for
own
use
or
for
sale
and
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
the
trucks
that
were
used
in
louisiana
your
honor,
the
tax
would
have
been
imposed
upon
the
component
parts
at
2%
tax.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct
and
that's
what
our
law
says
that
the
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
according
to
the
stipulation,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
that's
the
case.
well,
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
alright,
i
agree
with
you
your
honor,
that's
correct.
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
there
is
a
discrimination
here,
because
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
--
well,
i
would
suggest
that
we
have
to
compare
use
and
sales
taxpayers
in
equal
position.
take
two
manufacturers
of
these
trucks
in
louisiana,
one
imports
all
his
component
parts
and
pays
a
use
tax
on
them.
the
other
buys
all
these
component
parts
in
louisiana.
they
pay
identical
taxes.
manufacturers
in
louisiana
pay
identical
taxes.
and
in
this
case,
what
they
are
saying
is
not
that
there's
any
competition
in
louisiana
for
them,
not
that
the
--
not
that
any
one
manufactures
these
trucks
there
but
they
say,
"we
could”,
that's
what
the
stipulation
says.
they
could
manufacture
it
there
and
thereby
reduce
their
use
tax
burden
or
there
sales
tax
burden.
but
as
your
honor
knows,
we
can't
equate
all
the
taxes,
but
they
would
incur
other
taxes.
they
have
property
taxes.
they
have
use
and
sales
taxes
on
their
tools,
on
their
equipment
and
they
have
ad
valorem
taxes
on
the
movables
as
well
as
the
immovables.
they
increase
--
if
they
operated
there,
they
would
increase
the
apportionment
factor
for
their
income
and
their
franchise
tax.
in
other
words
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
they're
in
a
--
if
the
manufacture
there
--
they
would
be
in
a
different
tax
position.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
you
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no
sir,
i
don't
want
to
say
that
we
differentiate
or
that
there
is
an
inequality
because
i
would
like
to
say
that
as
of
the
moment
of
taxation
as
of
the
--
which
is
the
way
we
would
have
to
look
at
a
piece
of
that
item
of
tangible
personal
property,
as
of
the
moment
that
it
becomes
part
of
the
property,
of
a
massive
property
in
the
state,
we
say,
"well,
let's
see
which
you
have
here.”
and
this
discrimination
your
honor
doesn't
just
--
if
there's
a
discrimination,
it
doesn't
just
operate
against
the
use
taxpayer.
it
would
operate
against
a
sales
taxpayer
in
louisiana.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that
is
--
it's
withdrawn
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
from
inter
--
from
commerce.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
it
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
let
me
point
this
out
then
that
most
items
that
are
sold
at
retail
at
louisiana
come
into
the
state,
in
interstate
commerce
and
i
think
that's
probably
the
case
in
all
states.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
and
they're
put
on
the
shelf.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right.
and
the
same
thing
happens
in
the
use
tax
case.
they
bring
in
interstate
commerce,
items
identical
to
those
that
on
the
shelf
and
it
is
withdrawn
from
commerce
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right.
we
don't
seek
to
do
that
here
nor
--
and
he
admits
that
we
don't
do
that
here.
he
admits
he
owes
the
tax.
he
admits
that
the
tax
is
applicable.
he's
not
saying
that
he
is
in
interstate
commerce.
and
we
do
not
--
we
wouldn't
think
about
taxing
if
he
were
in
interstate
commerce.
he's
out
of
interstate
commerce,
commerce
is
at
an
end
and
we're
right
as
far
as
that's
concerned.
we're
right
within
the
silas
mason
case.
commerce
is
at
an
end,
it's
for
use
there
just
like
anything
on
the
shelf.
and
so
the
keep
--
the
property
is
in
identically
the
same
position
with
its
--
whether
it's
something
that
bears
the
sales
tax
that
came
in
interstate
commerce
or
something
that
bears
a
use
tax
that
came
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
let's
take
a
similar
truck
your
honor
that
is
made
in
duncan,
oklahoma
by
a
competitor.
this
is
by
the
mr.
chief
justice's
hypothetical.
he
comes
into
the
state
for
sale.
it
goes
on
the
shelf
in
a
retailer's
shop.
it's
there
for
sale
and
it
came
in
an
interstate
commerce.
a
customer
comes
in
and
says,
"i
want
to
buy
this
truck.”
well,
he
pays
of
course
a
price
that
is
the
equivalent
to
the
value
or
which
would
be
the
fair
market
value,
and
which
is
the
equivalent
price
that
we
impose
--
the
use
tax
on
this
case.
and
interstate
commerce
actually
has
no
bearing
on
it
because
the
commerce
is
at
end
in
both
cases.
and
what
we
are
equating,
we
are
equating
the
competitive
position
of
the
taxpayers
who
at
the
moment
of
taxation,
who
had
the
first
taking
of
an
item
for
use
in
louisiana,
pay
a
tax
upon
that
item
that
they
have
in
that
possession
there.
i
think
your
honor
was
mentioning
a
sandwich
that
you
might
bring
in
from
texas
yesterday
to
eat
in
louisiana.
well,
let's
see
how
serious
this
is
because
--
let's
say
you
brought
--
you
can
buy
in
louisiana
12
loaves
of
bread
for
$3.
you
go
out-of-state
and
you
buy
the
flour,
and
the
salt,
and
the
milk,
and
you
come
back
into
the
state
and
you
make
your
12
loaves
of
bread.
you
bought
your
flour
and
component
parts
of
your
12
loaves
of
bread
for
50
cents
outside
of
the
state.
you
have
12
loaves
of
bread
in
both
cases,
in
the
case
where
you
yourself
made
the
bread.
you
paid
one
cent.
in
the
other
case
where
you
bought
it
in
louisiana,
you
paid
six
cents.
if
there's
a
discrimination
your
honor,
it's
working
both
ways.
it's
working
against
the
sales
taxpayer
of
the
completed
item
as
well
a
use
taxpayer
on
a
completed
item
as
of
the
moment
it
comes
in.
there's
no
discrimination
against
the
interstate
commerce
in
the
case
that
i
just
gave
your
honor,
it's
the
man
that
pays
the
use
tax
that
has
an
advantage.
and
actually,
there's
no
advantage
as
far
as
revenue
is
concern
to
the
state
in
this
loophole
if
we
might
call
it
that,
because
louisiana
would
be
losing
taxes
by
not
taxing
--
by
not
looking
to
the
final
product
that
the
user
of
component
parts
might
be
wanting
to
make.
all
we've
done
is
--
as
i
think
the
legislature
has
done
is
giving
an
easy
way
to
administer
tax.
in
other
words,
if
we
want
to
look
to
the
end
product,
we
would
have
--
anybody
that
bought
something
that
might
be
a
component
part,
they
would
have
to
declare
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
it.
we'd
say,
"well,
if
you're
going
to
make
a
truck
out
of
that,
well
you
must
tell
us
when
the
truck's
completed,
we
want
to
come
see
what
you
made
to
see
with
the
fair
value
of
it
is.”
then
--
and
as
i
point
out,
it
works
both
ways.
it
doesn't
work
against
interstate
commerce.
it
works
for
interstate
commerce.
it
is
something
that's
available
to
anyone,
whether
it'd
be
louisiana
resident
or
a
non-resident.
it's
a
loophole
that's
available
to
anyone.
it's
a
loophole
that's
not
being
used
by
anyone
to
our
knowledge.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct
your
honor
except
for
one
thing.
we
will
--
we
do
give
a
tax
credit
for
any
similar
taxes
paid
to
another
state.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
which
we
feel
in
getting
to
the
casual
sale
aspect
for
a
moment
makes
the
casual
sale
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
and
it
would
apply
to
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
anything,
right.
anything
that
someone
purchased
something
that
he
may
improve
in
any
way.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
and
created
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
and
that's
why
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
(inaudible).
not
at
all
and
we
were
surprised
by
the
alabama
case.
but
ala
--
if
the
alabama
case,
there's
one
thing
different
about
the
alabama
situation
and
that's
that
they
don't
give
a
tax
credit
for
taxes
paid.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
in
other
states.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
and
it
may
or
may
not
make
a
difference
but
they
don't
and
we
do
and
if
they
can
show
they
pay
a
tax
on
that
airplane
--
that
a
tax
having
paid
on
that
airplane
we'll
say,
"fine,
you
get
a
credit
for
it
up
to
2%.”
but
it
would
apply
to
any
situation
whether
you
import
it
or
bought,
let's
say
retail
it
that
a
person
might
improve
or
increase
the
value
of
by
applying
his
own
work.
it
--
it's
not
really
designed
in
any
way
to
favor
the
industry
in
louisiana
or
to
increase
the
revenues
in
the
state.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
as
though
they
sold
it.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes
sir,
i
would
correct
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
don't
know
that
i
understand
the
question
your
honor
but
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
it's
a
use
in
louisiana.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
no
matter
what
they
do
with
it
your
honor.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
they
use
themselves?
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
thought
there
was
a
contract,
with
whom
was
the
contract?
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
the
way
i
understand
it.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that
is
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
uses
his
own
equipment.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well
sir
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
a
local
contractor
your
honor
who
has
--
doing
exactly
the
same
thing.
in
other
words,
he
is
building
it
in
louisiana
from
component
parts
and
using
it
in
louisiana,
would
have
paid
a
tax
upon
the
tangible
personal
property
at
the
time
it
came
in
to
--
made
up
the
component
parts
based
upon
their
fair
market
value
at
the
time
of
taxation
when
it
first
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
came
in
for
use.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
in
that
case
your
honor,
he
would
not
have
had
to
pay
on
the
total
aggregate.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
if
it
--
if
it's
a
comparable
your
honor
that's
correct.
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
situations
are
comparable.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
because
--
no,
a
man
can't
do
that
in
louisiana
in
the
–
in
halliburton's
case,
they're
producing
the
item
for
their
use.
they
bring
it
in
to
louisiana.
we
are
equating
--
what
they
bring
in
to
louisiana
is
not
--
these
nuts
and
bolts
or
anything
like
that.
we
are
looking
at
it
as
of
the
time
that
they
bring
it
in.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
the
arithmetic,
no
sir
it's
not
an
equation.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
the
mo
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right,
well
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
the
difference
your
honor
is
in
the
point
of
time.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
exactly
our
point.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes,
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
the
dollar
result
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
that's
not
my
justification,
what
i'm
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well
--
right.
i
do
make
it
if
it
--
if
these
are
two
comparables,
i
want
to
make
it.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
--
i
make
that
argument
if
they
are
not
comparable
of
course
your
honor
the
point
i
--
i
do
make
to
point
also
that
the
point
of
time
--
actually
its
almost
an
accident
of
time
and
place,
the
--
of
which
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
think
not
your
honor
because
the
sales
tax
applies
to
items
which
are
coming
in
interstate
commerce
in
the
exactly
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
the
same
way.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
the
same
as
halliburton
your
honor.
if
a
louisiana
resident
produced
the
thing
outside
and
brought
it
in,
as
a
matter
if
he
produced
it
inside,
took
it
to
texas
and
then
brought
it
back
in,
you'd
probably
have
to
pay
the
tax.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
he's
qualified
to
do
that.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
oh,
he's
qualified
to
do
business
and
he's
doing
business
in
fact.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
he
would
have
already
paid
that.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
right,
whether
he's
from
louisiana
or
anywhere
else.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that
is
correct
and
that's
our
point
that
we
view
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
in
each
case,
we
tax
sale.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
we're
taxing
the
sales
your
honor.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
certainly
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
identical.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
under
the
rule
they're
asking
for
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
under
the
rule
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
they're
asking
for,
that's
what
we'd
have
to
do.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
what
they're
asking
for
your
honor
and
that's
we
would
have
to
do
it
if
that
was
the
rule.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
know
of
no
other
way.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
oh,
of
which
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
we
do.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
we
do.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
by
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well
not
--
it's
not
a
comparable
tax
your
honor.
it's
not
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes.
what
we
are
saying
that
all
items
where
the
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
identical
to
the
tax
that
we're
charging.
what
we
are
saying
justice
frankfurter
is
that
all
items
whether
they
are
fruits,
(inaudible)
apples
or
oranges
or
hardware,
whatever
it
is
at
the
moment
of
sale
enjoy
the
same
position
as
far
as
the
tax
is
concerned
that
at
the
moment
of
sale
or
at
the
moment
of
use,
they're
in
the
same
position.
and
actually,
we
can
take
the
rule
maybe
and
run
away
back
as
far
as
the
piece
of
steel
is
concerned
then
maybe
no
tax
would
be
due
at
all
if
we're
going
to
take
out
the
labor
and
overhead.
we
get
it
back
into
--
we'd
get
it
back
into
the
ground
and
then
we
don't
tax
anything
but
movables
or
tangible
personal
property
and
maybe
on
a
piece
of
steel,
no
tax
would
be
used
at
all.
as
of
the
moment
of
taxation
your
honor,
all
items
enjoy
the
same
position
and
we
look
at
it
what
it
is
at
that
time
and
it
doesn't
affect
interstate
commerce
at
first
because
it
applies
both
ways.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
not
--
of
course,
no.
it's
a
fair
market
value
as
of
the
time
it
comes
into
louisiana.
and
our
supreme
court
clarified
that
for
us
and
said
that
the
cost
price
meant
fair
market
value
as
of
the
moment
it
came
in
and
if
it
had
incurred
any
depreciation
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
it
will
be
easy
to
determine
that
way,
yes
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right,
in
that
case
but
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
it
would
be
the
same
your
honor.
oh
no,
actually
the
measure
your
honor,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
the
rule
is
that
if
the
fair
market
value
when
it
gets
to
louisiana,
that's
the
--
that's
what
we're
going
to
put
it
on.
now,
we
may
well
say
administratively,
well
the
fair
market
value
is
what
you
paid
for
because
that's
what
you
are
willing
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right,
but
if
they
could.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
the
tax
in
--
as
far
as
what
we
could
administrate
to
show
the
tax
would
be
a
little
less
in
halliburton's
case
then
if
they
had
purchased
it.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
don't
know
what
we
are
going
to
do
when
that
problem
comes
up
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
your
honor.
and
if
it
does
comes
up,
i
don't
know
what
our
court
is
going
to
do,
but
they
have
said
that
is
fair
market
value
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
so
when
we
start
increasing
the
value
on
top
of
someone's
actual
cost,
i
don't
know
what
the
results
will
be.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
don't
think
we
treat
it
as
conclusive
your
honor
but
in
making
our
audits,
we
pick
up
that
price.
and
if
they
come
in
and
show
a
lesser
value,
well
then
we
probably
go
along
with
them.
if
they
show
a
depreciation,
we'll
reduce
the
amount
that
we
picked
up.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
--
we
have
never
tried
to
increase
the
value
or
say
that
it
is
worth
more
than
the
paid
for
it.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
never
have
done
that
and
of
course,
we're
not
set
up
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
think
that
then
we
would
have
evidence
which
we
don't
have
now
because
there
are
no
sales.we
would
have
evidence
of
what
the
fair
market
value
is.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
the
tax
--
i
don't
know
if
you're
asking
again
the
same
question
about
the
ultimate
mathematical
amount
of
the
tax.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
if
you're
talking
about
the
ultimate
mathematical
amount
of
the
tax,
your
honor
you
are
right,
it
is
right
that
it
is
the
difference
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
without
regard
to
any
other
taxes.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
and
unlike
halliburton,
he
operates
only
in
louisiana,
he
do
--he
isn't
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
and
without
regard
to
any
of
the
facts,
it
seems
that
he
would
have
an
advantage
due
to
his
own
ingenuity
of
location.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well
i
--
yes.
i
don't
know
that
it's
necessarily
your
honor.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that
is
the
problem.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that
is
the
problem.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that
is
the
problem.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
that
is
the
problem.
it
does
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
the
existence
of
what
might
be
called
a
loophole.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
exact
discrimination.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
not
at
all.
all
my
point
is
that
--
for
example,
it
does
pay
income
tax.
i
suppose
that
its
profit
structure
is
such
that
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right.
and
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
it's
a
tax
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
oh
well.
well
your
honor
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i'm
--
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
existence
of
the
so-called
loophole,
it
is
discriminatory.
but
if
it
is
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
there's
that
--
is
that
a
difference.
i
will
--
do
want
to
comment
on
the
other
--
of
the
tax
structure.
they
pay
a
certain
rate
of
tax
based
upon
apportionment
formulas,
their
income
tax
and
their
franchise
tax.
they
pay
their
use
tax
depending
upon
what
they
do
have
there.
if
they
had
more
there,
of
course
they
would
have
a
greater
tax,
property
taxes
or
ad
valorem
taxes.
if
they
had
more
there,
they
would
pay
use
taxes
on
tools
and
machinery.
if
they
had
wages
there
and
employees
there
and
a
factory
there,
they
would
have
their
--
the
apportionment
factor
for
income
and
to
franchise
tax
purposes
would
be
greater
also.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
so
there
would
be
a
difference.
i
don't
want
to
say
that
they
certainly
do
pay
taxes
now
but
it's
apportioned
according
to
what
they
do
there.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
they're
not.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right,
that
--
they're
not.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
none
of
it.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
i
think
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
would
think
so.
actually
when
the
stipulation
was
made,
i'm
certain
that
our
argument
was
going
to
be
made
simply
as
to
the
fact
of
them
all.
and
that
--
which
is
actually
the
reason
that
we
conceded
the
meaning
of
those
words
in
the
stipulation,
they
would
not
be
taxed
upon
labor
and
shop
overhead.
i
don't
know
what
it
means.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
oh,
i'm
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
you're
talking
about
those
that
consider
the
entire
tax
structure
in
a
tax
case.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
the
point
that
i'm
making.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well
your
honor
i
haven't
gone
into
that,
but
i'm
not
making
that
point
and
i
don't
say
that
--
i
don't
say
that
that's
the
case
here
at
all.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
whatever
he
brings
in
just
like
anyone
else
who
might
bring
in
something
whether
it's
a
louisiana
man
that
goes
in
and
gets
it
--
brings
it
in
or
whether
it's
a
foreigner
that
goes
there
and
get
the
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes
sir,
we
would
tax
a
louis
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
if
he
brought
that
same
item
in,
he
would
be
taxed
identically
to
them.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
has
absolutely
nothing.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
what
we're
saying
as
of
what
--
the
tax
is
--
the
tax
they
do
pay
your
honor
is
on
the
things
that
they
used
in
it's
an
identical
tax.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
the
transaction
that
--
the
transaction
that
is
taxed
your
honor
is
the
first
use
and
if
the
tax
is
identical
for
everyone
including
the
local
manufacturer
on
its
first
use
of
tangible
personal
property,
he
may
eventually
end
up
with
something
that
is
either
greater
value
or
lesser
value.
but
this
is
at
a
point
after
the
tax
has
been
imposed.
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
few
words.
now,
i
see
my
time
is
nearly
up.
about
the
casual
sale
aspect
and
that's
the
airplane
that
was
purchased
in
another
state
at
a
casual
sale
and
when
it
was
brought
in,
we
imposed
the
used
tax
as
of
the
moment
it
became
part
of
massive
property.
of
course
the
same
argument
made
before
applies
here
because
it's
--
the
purpose
is
to
see
that
everyone,
all
properties
had
been
the
subject
of
a
2%
tax.
what
makes
--
the
way
we
handle
this,
i
think
and
which
is
unlike
alabama,
constitution
of
the
fact
that
we
give
a
credit,
we
offer
a
credit.
if
they
tax
--
if
that
product
has
ever
been
to
subject
of
a
2%
similar
tax,
or
any
portion
of
it
anywhere
else,
we
give
the
credit.
alabama
does
not
give
the
credit.
the
cases
except
for
that
point
that
they
don't
give
a
credit,
the
case
is
directly
against
us,
the
alabama
case,
the
bay
towing
case
is
directly
against
this.
but
the
--
in
our
case,
if
they
show
the
credit
bearing
the
exact
same
position
as
anyone
who
would
have
purchased
a
similar
item
in
the
state
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
it
is.
but
actually
california
offers
no
credit,
ohio
offers
no
credit,
north
dakota
does.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
he
gave
--
he
said
that
--
the
stipulation
says
that,
"if
this
had
been
purchased
in
louisiana,
there
would've
been
no
tax
on
it."
we
agree
on
casual
sale
in
louisiana
would
not
have
borne
a
2%
tax
to
halliburton.
but
the
person
that
sold
at
a
casual
sale
in
louisiana
would
have
already
paid
the
2%
tax
on
it,
and
it
would
have
borne
2%
tax.
and
he
gave
the
situation
i
think
of
selling,
he's
tried
to
be
here
and
--
as
compared
to
selling
it
back
home,
well,
it
would've
already
borne
a
2%
tax.
i
would
--
had
a
credit
and
i
don't
have
to
pay
a
use
tax
on
his
time
when
i
take
it
back
to
louisiana
with
me,
because
i'm
entitled
to
the
credit.
but
we
feel
that
the
credit
does
equate
to
tax
burden
on
all
competitive
people
who
may
be
using
tangible
personal
property.
if
it
has
borne
2%
tax
and
they
bring
it
in,
we
could
give
a
credit.
in
this
case,
it
did
never
bear
it
so
we
imposed
a
2%
tax
to
be
on
equal
basis
with
every
other
taxpayer
that
has
an
airplane
like
that.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
we
can
show
that
louisiana
hasn't
done
quite
as
bear
as
mr.
taylor
would
have
the
quote
i
believe,
i
think
that
the
theme
of
our
law
is
equality
and
it
is
certainly
is
a
definite
attempt
to
equalize
all
the
interest.
and
of
course
he
says
that
we
attempt
to
compare
incomparables
and
we
say
that
he
has.
in
this
case,
it's
true
that
a
manufacturer-user
in
louisiana
would
pay
a
tax
only
on
the
items
that
they
themselves
either
purchased
in
louisiana,
they'd
pay
the
2%
sales
tax.
this
is
what
they
use
in
louisiana.
if
they
purchased
it
outside
of
louisiana,
in
this
case,
knots
and
bolts
and
sheet
metal
and
the
chassis
and
maybe
a
motor,
what
they
bring
in
to
louisiana
and
that
the
item
that
they
used
as
of
the
time
they
bring
it
in
and
becomes
part
of
the
mass
of
property
that
is
out
of
commerce,
then
that
is
what
is
taxed.
and
that
is
the
moment
of
taxation.
in
this
case,
they
bring
in
a
completed
item
and
that
is
what
they
use
in
louisiana.
and
a
manufacturer-user
such
as
halliburton
in
louisiana
whose
manufacturing
trucks
for
use
all
over
the
world
would
pay
the
tax
on
all
of
the
knots
and
bolts,
on
all
of
the
sheet
metal,
on
all
of
the
chassis
and
of
all
the
motors
no
matter
where
it
went.
and
if
management
found
that
they
could
afford
to
pay
the
tax
on
all
of
the
items
that
they
did
use,
and
produced
in
louisiana
more
cheaply
rather
than
pay
them
the
item
that
they
did
bring
to
louisiana,
well
then,
certainly,
it
is
a
management
problem
of
location.
it
isn't
even
a
loophole
in
taxation.
because
they're
being
taxed
as
of
the
taxable
moment
on
what
they
do
use
in
louisiana
and
we
do
not
tax
overhead.
and
we
do
not
tax
labor.
we
tax
value
or
cost.
we
tax
the
cost
in
the
sales
tax.
we
tax
the
cost
in
the
use
tax.
it's
true
that
the
labor
and
shop
overhead
in
this
case
formed
the
part
of
the
value
or
cost
of
the
item.
but
louisiana
is
not
taxing
labor
and
shop
overhead.
we
are
taxing
what
has
been
brought
into
louisiana
and
what
is
being
used
in
louisiana.
and
as
of
that
time,
which
is
the
only
time
that
louisiana
gets
jurisdiction
incidentally,
at
least
the
first
moment
that
they
get
jurisdiction.
it
is
of
that
time
we
look
and
say,
“what
do
you
have
here?
and
what
does
this
cost
to
you?”
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
it
falls
on
the
purchaser.
in
other
words
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
the
one
that's
going
to
use
it
just
as
it
does
in
the
use
tax
on
the
one
that
is
going
to
use
it.
the
moment
of
taxation
in
both
cases
is
identical
is
a
moment
that
a
user
or
consumer
takes
the
property
and
is
ready
for
using
it.
and
as
of
that
moment,
that's
the
moment
of
taxation
in
both
cases,
the
rate
is
the
same
and
the
base
is
the
same
because
it
is
the
cost
of
the
item
as
of
that
moment.
now,
in
this
case,
--
well,
really
what
they're
complaining
about
almost
is
the
--
is
that
it's
a
cheaper
tax
when
you
prove
that
you
eat
home
than
it
is
when
you
eat
out.
but
the
situation
is
a
diff
--
different
because
in
this
case
when
you
eat
home,
you
buy
a
large
quantity
of
food
and
you
pay
tax
on
all
of
it.
it's
true
that
per
meal
maybe
the
tax
is
different.
but
if
you
come
through
louisiana
and
you
stop
and
you
buy
meal
at
the
restaurant,
you
buy
your
steak
and
you
pay
$4,
you
pay
2%
on
it.
if
you
ate
that
same
steak
at
home,
well,
it
will
be
whatever
the
cost
was
in
the
store
but
you're
going
to
--
you
pay
on
all
of
your
groceries
no
matter
where
you
eat
them,
no
matter
--
whether
you
eat
it
or
not.
in
other
words,
if
they're
spoiled,
you
would
still
have
paid
your
tax
at
the
moment
that
you
purchased
it.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
sir?
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
some
of
it,
most
of
it
comes
from
outside.
we
raise
it
alive,
your
honor.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
when
it
is
sold
to
the
ultimate
consumer
or
the
user.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes,
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct
and
the
interest
here
or
more
than
just
the
interest
that
which
points
up
to
this.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
we
have
to
collect
the
sales
the
tax.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
if
you're
in
the
business
of
selling
them.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
we
have
an
exemption,
your
honor,
for
a
casual
sale,
that
would
probably
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
and
there
would
be
no
tax.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
in
his
particular
hypothet
your
honor,
i
believe
that
he
had
--
he
said
he
hired
someone
to
do
the
work,
in
which
case
that
is
a
taxable
service
in
louisiana
or
make
anymore
like
this
particular
one,
if
he
does
the
work
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
in
his
hypothet,
he
said
that
on
the
louisiana
side,
he
had
someone
do
the
work
for
him.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
and
this
is
a
taxable
service.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
and
this
is
a
tax
----
on
both
sides?
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
this
would
be
a
taxable
service
in
louisiana
and
it
would
bear
the
tax.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
a
2%
tax.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
on
the
service.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes,
sir.
as
a
part
of
the
same
sec
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
--
part
of
the
same
section
that
levies
that
tax.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no.
it's
akin
to
the
sales
tax.
in
fact,
it's
contained
in
the
same
section
that
contains
the
sales
tax.
and
it
says
there's
a
--
is
hereby
levied
a
tax
upon
all
sales
or
services
as
here
in
defining
the
state
at
the
rate
of
2%
on
the
amounts
paid
or
charged
for
said
service.
indeed,
this
particular
service
has
to
do
with
manufacture.
and
it
is
a
2%
tax
on
that.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
not
under
the
particular
facts
of
his
case.
they
would
not
pay
--
that
overhead
would
not
be
included
in
the
tax
base.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
there's
a
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
there's
a
difference
in
his
hypothet
and
the
facts
of
his
case
about
the
boat.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
in
the
boat,
he
has
someone
else
to
the
--
do
the
work.
in
this
case,
he
does
it
himself.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
i
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
he
--
if
he
were
himself
doing
it
with
his
own
labor
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
there
would
be
no
tax
on
the
labor
or
the
overhead.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
nor
would
it
being
--
nor
would
it
be
included
in
the
value
of
the
item.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
it
amounts
to
as
i
point
out
is
taking
the
component
parts
of
say
your
meal
and
fixing
it
yourself,
you
pay
tax
on
what
you
buy
at
the
time
you
buy
it
or
what
you
bring
in
and
use
at
the
time
that
you
do
that.
now,
if
he
should
ruin
for
example
what
he
has
brought
in,
his
tax
would
not
be
refunded
in
any
way.
if
he
is
doing
it
in
louisiana,
he
pays
on
all
of
that
he's
using.
and
in
this
case,
i'm
sure
that
he
doesn't
use
10%
of
his
trucks
in
louisiana,
if
he
would
pay
on
all
the
material
which
he
used
in
louisiana,
the
situations
are
different.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
no
sir.
we
do
not
charge
tax
on
the
labor
and
overhead
but
we
do
take
the
value
of
the
item,
and
in
this
case,
it
is
--
since
there
is
no
market
for
this,
for
this
particular
item,
we
compute
the
cost
by
including
labor
and
overhead.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
because
of
the
time
that
the
tax
is
imposed,
the
taxable
moment,
this
is
--
the
ultimate
item
is
not
what
they
--
when
--
is
not
what
they
first
take.
at
the
taxable
moment,
what
they
first
take
is
the
component
parts.
and
he
doesn't
bring
income.
he
wants
to
be
taxed
as
if
what
he
brought
in
were
component
parts
but
he
does
not.
he
brings
in
a
highly
refined
piece
of
machinery.
and
that's
the
reason
we
don't.
oh,
it
is
not
--
we're
not
taxing
the
truck.
at
the
time
of
the
use,
it
is
not
a
truck.
at
the
time
of
the
use,
what
he
has
is
sheet
metal
and
the
component
parts.
and
that
is
what
we
tax
at
the
time
of
the
use.
now,
he
ends
up,
it's
true.
he
would
end
up
with
a
highly
refined
piece
of
machinery
but
it
--
after
the
tax
has
already
been
imposed
upon
the
component
parts
and
in
this
case,
under
the
stipulation
in
this
case,
we
would
not
tax
that,
at
least
at
--
the
component
--
the
ultimate
item
in
this
particular
case
would
of
course
be
--
have
a
far
greater
value
than
the
component
parts.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir,
because
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
not
in
the
--
in
this
particular
case,
this
--
if
it
--
if
you
want
to
term
it
a
discrimination
or
difference
in
taxation,
it
doesn't
bear
solely
on
interstate
commerce.
it
bears
against
everyone
who's
paid
a
sales
tax
on
a
like
item.
or
was
--
everyone
who
had
purchased
either
within
the
state
or
without
the
state
and
paid
the
sales
tax
would
be
in
the
same
if
it's
a
disadvantage,
would
be
at
the
same
disadvantage
to
the
person
who
creates
his
own
ultimate
product.
the
--
if
there's
a
discrimination,
it's
not
just
against
interstate
commerce,
it's
against
the
instate
purchaser
as
well
as
the
out-of-state
purchaser
or
the
out
of
--
or
the
one
who
brings
in
the
item
in
its
completed
state.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
that's
not
exactly
the
way
we
tax
our
own
people.
my
point
is
that
the
situations
are
not
identical.
we
would
tax
our
own
people
on
perhaps
10
times
as
much
component
parts
as
used
in
the
thing.
we
would
tax
them
on
all
of
these
component
parts.
if
he
would
be
willing
to
pay
the
2%
tax
on
every
component
part
used
in
his
factory
in
duncan,
oklahoma
which
is
the
way
we
were
taxing
if
he
were
in
louisiana,
we'd
be
happy
to
accept
it.
but
he
doesn't
want
to
be
taxed.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
and
uses
one
in
louisiana
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no.
i'm
saying
that
to
--
that's
what
he
would
do
if
he
were
in
louisiana.
if
his
operation
were
in
louisiana
and
he
made
a
hundred
trucks
and
99
of
them
went
out
of
state,
he
would've
paid
tax
on
all
of
the
component
parts.
that's
why
the
situations
aren't
identical.
he
would've
paid
on
all
of
the
component
parts
not
just
the
one
in
louisiana,
every
one.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
as
it
comes
in
and
this
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right.
and
in
this
case,
if
he
had
his
plant
instead
of
in
duncan,
in
louisiana,
in
shreveport
for
example,
he
would
pay
on
every
little
item
he
brought
in
for
all
the
trucks
no
matter
where
it
would
go.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes,
if
he
did.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
it's
a
privilege,
yes,
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i'm
not
sure
your
honor.
the
stipulation
in
this
case,
that's
what
the
stipulation
is
to
that
effect
that
we're
going.
actually,
i
think
perhaps,
may
be
the
tax
is
applicable.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
but
it
--
the
use
tax
seems
to
apply
to
everything.
but
as
far
as
the
stipulation
is
concerned,
what
you
say
is
correct.
there's
no
--
there
is
no
tax
on
the
use
of
stuff.
but
most
of
this
stuff,
most
of
the
stuff
in
louisiana,
like
most
of
the
stuff
in
all
states
has
come
in
on
interstate
commerce
even
if
it's
sold
at
retail.
in
other
words,
there
is
the
--
its
--
interstate
commerce
is
incidental
to
this
situation
because
all
automobiles,
all
trucks
--
there's
no
manufacturer
of
that
kind
in
louisiana.
is
--
all
come
in
and
the
man
that
sells
these
things
at
retail,
he
has
to
charge
2%
of
the
sales
price
and
the
interest
to
be
equated
are
all
of
the
interest.
in
this
situation,
which
mr.
taylor
is
talking
about,
is
not
identical
because
he
would
pay
on
all
those
trucks
that
he
manufactured
whether
he
used
it
in
australia
and
he
has
them
there.
in
south
america
and
he
has
them
there.
he
has
them
in
every
state
that
produces
oil.
in
every
state
in
which
there
is
exploration
for
oil.
and
if
he
were
manufacturing
those
trucks
in
louisiana,
he
would've
paid
on
all
the
component
parts
wherever
they
are.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
think
that
we
would.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
the
question
that
is
here
is
how
far
down
the
line
are
we
going
to
follow
the
stuff
that's
brought
in.
if
you
bring
in
lumber
and
we
say,
“okay,
you're
ready
to
use
it,
pay
us
the
tax
on
it”,
which
is
the
way
we
handle
it.
now,
how
far
should
we
have
to
follow
that?
the
man
goes
and
he
builds
a
boat
with
it.
now,
do
we
have
to
come
find
him
and
say,
“oh,
you
made
a
boat
out
of
that,
we
want
more
tax”,
and
so
he
gives
us
more
tax.
he
puts
his
boat
in
the
water
and
it
sinks,
and
he
said,
“well,
wait
a
minute,
i've
made
a
mistake.
it's
no
good.
it's
valueless”.
and
then
do
we
try
to
still
follow
and
say,
“here's
your
money
back”.
we
take
in
as
of
the
time
that
he
gets
there
for
use.
and
i
say,
“what
do
you
have
here?
we're
going
to
charge
you
tax
on
that?”
that's
when
our
jurisdiction
comes
over
the
item.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
doubt
it,
your
honor.
he
either
--
they
would
fly
--
if
they
were
bringing
it
to
sell,
they
were
probably
entering
the
sales
business
or
at
least
they
were
bringing
in
for
some
type
of
use
that
would
make
it
taxable
and
that's
our
point
on
this.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
would
--
its
going
to
either
be
a
use
or
they
would've
been
entering
the
sales
business,
your
honor.
i'm
sure
that
we
would
want
to
tax
it
now.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
well,
i
don't
think
they're
general.
i
think
the
person
can
be
in
more
than
one
business,
say
generally
they're
in
the
newspaper
business
but
if
they
want
--
if
they
want
to
get
into
a
business
of
selling
an
airplane,
they're
going
to
go
out
and
try
to
acquire
purchasers.
it's
--
we
would
ordinarily
tax
them.
now
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
i
hate
to
give
it
--
we
don't
have
the
situation
in
it.
but
we
would
try
to
impose
the
tax
either
under
the
use
tax
or
under
the
sales
tax.
because
the
purpose
of
the
whole
thing
is
in
our
argument
is
for
the
isolated
sale
is
that
louisiana
unlike
the
rest
of
the
states,
grants
a
credit
for
taxes
paid
by
the
state.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
right.
but
an
item
sold
in
louisiana,
an
isolated
sale
will
have
already
been
the
subject
of
the
2%
tax.
was
every
item
or
tangible
personal
property
in
the
state
of
louisiana
would've
been
the
subject
of
a
2%
tax.
and
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes,
sir.
and
in
this
case,
if
they
bring
in
the
sale,
we
say,
“well,
have
you
paid
the
2%
tax
anywhere?”
and
they
say,
“no”.
we
say,
“well
fine,
you
owe
us”.
but
if
they
show
what
they
have
then
we
give
them
the
credit
and
that
establishes
an
equality.
it's
not
just
an
equality
for
the
vendor,
it's
an
equality
of
the
users,
the
people
that
in
compete
--
in
business
competition.
they
have
the
same
burden
and
to
my
way
of
thinking,
the
whole
thing
is
a
completely
establishing
equality.
now,
it's
true
that
you
--
if
you
can
so
establish
your
business
in
one
state
or
another
as
to
have
a
lesser
tax
burden,
there's
no
objection
to
that.
i
don't
think
there's
ever
been
an
objection
to
it.
but
in
this
case,
if
halliburton
were
operating
there,
it
would
have
paid
taxes
on
a
lot
more
than
they
want
to
pay
us
now.
and
insofar
as
the
isolated
sale
case,
we'd
give
them
a
credit
if
it's
borne
it.
any
isolated
sale
in
the
louisiana
would've
been
the
subject
of
it
already.
same
goes
for
his
necktie.
it
would've
already
borne
the
tax
of
louisiana.
and
if
he
had
bought
it
somewhere
elsewhere
it
had
borne
it,
all
he
has
to
show
is
that
he
had
paid
it
and
we
say
no
tax.
and
so
equality
is
established
by
having
all
tangible
personal
property
in
the
hands
of
users
having
borne
a
2%
tax
either
sales
or
use.
and
that
puts
the
vendors,
we're
not
trying
to
give
our
vendors
any
kind
of
special
advantage
and
they
don't
get
it
because
one
can
go
out
of
the
state
to
the
vendor
of
his
choice
and
get
credit
for
the
tax.
and
we
don't
push
anyone.
now,
other
states
don't
do
that.
and
that's
the
difference
of
these
cases
that
he's
talking
about.
he
says
the
--
alabama
does
not
give
a
credit.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
and
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
when
it's
for
the
owner
and
user
your
honor.
we
have
an
exemption
where
for
resale
or
for
manufacture
for
resale.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
oh!
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
of
course
not,
they're
merely
forms
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
the
thing
that
is
there.
and
that
the
cost
of
those
items
in
this
situation
is
what
is
used
to
determine
the
cost.
because
that
is
all
that
is
available
and
it's
not
unreasonable
to
use
it
in
this
case.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
we
don't
do
either.
we
charge
of
the
knots
and
bolts
as
they
come
in
for
use.
we
don't
ever
look
at
what
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
we
don't
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
we
don't
look
further
or
pass
the
first
moment
of
taxation.
what
is
done
with
it
after
it
comes
in
louisiana,
well,
we
don't
feel
that
the
law
require
--
makes
us
go,
keep
watching
to
see
what's
become
of
these
particular
items
that
he
used.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
it
would
be.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
would
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
right.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
absolutely.
and
the
whole
thing
is
they
would
have
as
a
measure
is
not
susceptible
administration.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
yes,
sir.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
that's
correct.
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
we
treat
that
as
we
have
treated
them,
the
items
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
chapman
l.
sanford
no,
sir.
thank
you,
your
honor.
