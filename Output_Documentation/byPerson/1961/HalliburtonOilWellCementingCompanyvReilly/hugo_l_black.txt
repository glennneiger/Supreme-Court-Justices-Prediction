justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
bother
you
if
i
ask
you
now,
suppose
that
same
machine
has
been
manufactured
in
louisiana,
would
there
have
been
a
sales
tax
applied
to
anything
sold
in
that
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
i'm
curious
because
this
seems
to
bring
up
a
new
record
of
the
use
tax
and
the
sales
taxes
which
perhaps
have
not
been
covered
by,
is
it
true
or
not
that
ordinarily
when
completed
products
of
both
intrastate
from
another
state
that
the
--
and
the
use
tax
apply
that
the
--
it's
imposed
on
the
value
of
the
completed
articles
rather
on
the
aggregate
of
some
of
the
parts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
take
your
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
are
many
things
that
going
to
the
manufacture
of
products.
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
this
myself
up
to
this
time.
many
things
go
into
the
manufacture
of
products,
take
the
tomato
that
was
mentioned.
you
have
a
lot
of
work
done
in
another
state,
some
other
just
buy
an
insecticide
to
kill
the
--
to
make
it
grow.
there,
you
think
that
are
into
it.
your
use
tax,
however,
when
you
--
when
that
tomato
comes
in,
if
you
do
have
a
use
tax
on
groceries?
i
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
your
use
tax
applies
to
that
regard
to
how
much
labor
was
put
on
in
anywhere
else,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
you'd
be
in
the
same
situation
as
the
farmer
who
was
shipping
tomatoes
in
and
--
for
his
own
use,
of
his
own
factory
use
as
you
are
here
with
halliburton.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
(inaudible)
yet
has
not
met
the
situation
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
not
attempted
to
--
alleviate
a
situation
of
this
kind,
one,
if
its
sales
tax
on
the
complete
value
of
what's
sold
as
to
use
tax
on
a
complete
value
of
what's
used.
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
regard
to
where
it
was
produced
or
anything
else
to
that
kind
but
you
do
not
because
that's
not
in
the
usual
pattern
of
sales
in
use
taxes.
you
do
not
apply
use
tax
on
a
thing
it's
sold
in
the
state.
and
that's
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
had
a
law
like,
i
believe
its
indiana
that
has
one
of
that
kind?
i'm
not
sure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this?
while
in
this
case,
halliburton
has
no
competitor,
manufactures
these
themselves
and
then
go
to
louisiana.
the
rule
as
before
us
would
apply
to
many
such
transactions
where
there
are
half
a
dozen
different
manufacturers.
suppose
halliburton
had
bought
this
machine
from
someone
else
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
had
brought
it
in
to
use
it,
what
would've
the
tax
been
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
identical.
now,
there
are
many
inferences,
are
they
not
in
which
just
such
things
occurred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
you
figure
out
this
case
and
how
is
--
how
--
under
that
rule,
how
would
you
figure
that
out?
have
you
got
to
look
back
to
see
how
many
items
went
in
it
that
you
would've
charged
the
sales
tax
on
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
louisiana
has
to
look
in
to
it
and
suppose
it's
an
automobile.
this
is
partly
an
automobile
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
have
to
find
out
what
kind
of
tax
would've
been
paid
in
oklahoma
and
louisiana
on
the
various
items
had
they
been
purchased
there,
and
then
equates
your
tax
arithmetically
to
the
fraction,
the
part
of
opinions
with
aggregate
of
those
items?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
--
there
may
be
another
way
and
i
was
asking
you
that
because
i
was
trying
to
find
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
sales
tax
should
be
comparable,
wouldn't
it,
on
their
machines,
on
the
completed
machines?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
the
tax
on
a
completed
machine
has
it
been
made
and
manufactured
in
louisiana
and
sold
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
a
general
personal
property
tax
in
louisiana
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
right,
does
it
mean
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out
to
what
the
--
does
it
mean
that
the
states
cannot
apply
their
use
tax
to
any
equipment
brought
in
the
state
purchased
from
an
out
of
the
state
manufacturer
or
distributor
insofar
as
the
value
is
--
represents
labor
in
another
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effect
would
this
have
on
general
motors
and
ford's
sales
of
automobiles?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
do
that
to
some
extent,
do
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
other
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
meant
to
ask
you,
does
--
how
many
states
have
the
same
kind
of
tax
law,
use
tax
law
that
louisiana
has
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
of
them
that
have
held
on
your
side
on
this
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
meant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many?
is
it
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
fair
statement,
isn't
it,
that
you've
raised
a
noble
point
in
this
law
where
it's
been
enforced
the
other
way
generally
throughout
the
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
raise
your
own
steak?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
raise
your
own
steak
that
some
of
it
comes
from
outside
or
has
a
little
labor
put
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
halliburton
were
to
sell
this
machine
as
you
propose
the
use
tax,
would
you
have
to
pay
a
sales
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
will
collect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
he
decided
to
sell
this
one
later.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
should
be
a
casual
sale?
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
use
or
sale?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
louisiana
ever
tries
to
put
any
tax
on
the
knots
and
bolts
as
separate
things
in
a
completed
machine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
whether
--
when
a
machine
comes
into
the
state,
a
completed
machine
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
has
knots,
bolts,
maybe
an
aluminum
coming
from
colorado,
steel
coming
from
alabama
and
all
and
various
other
places.
do
you
try
to
split
it
up
and
on
your
use
tax,
tax
the
knots
and
bolts
and
the
material?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you're
trying
to
tax
a
thing
that's
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
put
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
put
the
tax
first
as
i
understand
it
on
the
knots
and
bolts
when
you
come
in
there
because
they
come
in
as
knots
and
bolts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
don't
come
in
as
completed
machines.
