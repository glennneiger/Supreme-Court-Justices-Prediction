justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
said
that
halliburton
is
a
manufacturer,
i'm
looking
at
the
picture
of
the
equipment
in
the
record.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
doesn't
manufacture
the
truck
itself,
does
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
taylor,
you
are
drawing
a
distinction
between
a
purchaser
who
is
not
a
manufacturer
and
a
manufacturer?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
i
take
it,
your
argument
is
that
in
each
case,
you
would
seek
equality
of
tax
treatment.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
there
has
not
been
equality
here.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
taylor,
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question,
you're
dealing
with
something
else
other
than
what
he
inquired
about?
aren't
you
dealing
with
the
isolated
sale
aspect
of
your
case?
what
about
the
overhead
aspect?
are
there
states
on
the
overhead,
the
labor
and
overhead
aspect
that
had
taken
a
position
contrary
to
the
position
you're
asserting
here?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
--
to
take
this
general
motors
illustration
that
have
been
put
to
you,
suppose
that
chevrolet
that
general
motors
manufactures
assembles
and
sends
them
to
louisiana,
chevrolet
sell
it
for
$3000.
if
it
is
sold,
that
chevrolet
is
sold
in
louisiana,
a
sales
tax
would
have
to
be
paid
on
$3000
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
the
chevrolet
is
assembled
in
louisiana,
if
the
general
motors
has
an
assembly
plant
and
if
the
materials
that
go
into
that
chevrolet
cost
$1500
and
the
labor
is
$1500.
as
i
understand
you,
you
would
say
that
under
louisiana
law
it
would
be
taxable
under
the
sales
tax
law
for
$1500.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
you
are
then
arguing
that
if
the
chevrolet
is
assembled
in
detroit
and
$1500
are
materials
and
$1500
are
labor,
and
the
chevrolet
is
shipped
into
louisiana
for
use
by
chevrolet
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
as
company
car
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
what
you
mentioned
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
that
it
ought
to
be
only
taxed
for
$1500
as
a
company
car?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
counsel,
take
this
--
the
chevrolet
illustration
i
used
earlier,
if
an
automobile
is
manufactured
in
louisiana
and
sold
chevrolet,
where
is
the
--
at
what
point
does
the
sales
tax
attached?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
from
the
distributor
to
the
ultimate
consumer?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
not
at
the
manufacturer
level
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
to
the
distributor?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
sanford,
may
i
ask
you
at
this
point,
the
question
is
not
related
precisely
for
that
but
to
the
isolated
sale.
take
this
airplane
that's
involved
here.
suppose
that
the
seller,
the
western
newspapers
union
in
new
york
flew
the
airplane
into
the
airport,
to
either
in
new
orleans
or
baton
rouge,
not
for
use
but
to
show
it
to
halliburton.
and
halliburton
then
bought
that
airplane
right
in
new
orleans.
would
that
be
regarded
to
be
an
isolated
sale
under
your
law
exempt
from
the
sales
tax?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
what
use
would
be
invalid?
here's
a
case
where
--
suppose
halliburton
said
--
read
an
advertisement
and
said,
“we
see
you
have
an
airplane”.
west
germany
is
not
in
the
business
of
selling
airplanes
and
it's
a
company
plane.
“so
we
see
you
have
an
airplane,
we're
interested.
would
you
bring
it
in
to
the
airport,
we'd
like
to
take
a
look
at
it.”
and
they
fly
it
in.
at
that
point,
halliburton
looks
at
it
and
says,
“we
like
your
airplane.
okay,
we
buy
it”.
do
you
interpret
that
to
be
a
use
in
new
orleans
that
subjects
western
to
a
use
tax?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
sales
business,
generally?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
what
is
the
meaning
of
your
isolated
sales
provision
then?
and
he
sell
--
there's
a
sale.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
you
also
give
an
exemption
for
an
isolated
sale.
