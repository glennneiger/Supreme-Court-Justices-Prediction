justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
whether
it's
relevant,
but
the
opinion
of
the
--
your
court
that
the
strike
was
intended
against
the
charged
employee
for
admittedly
unsatisfactory
work.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
relevant
to
our
--
to
the
issue
of
satisfactoriness
of
(inaudible)
as
well
as
to
our
problems?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
in
an
order
--
i
shouldn't
take
your
time,
you
said
at
the
time
of
the
strike,
it
wasn't
admitted.
the
strike
in
the
instant
case
was
in
protest
against
the
discharge
of
an
employee
for
admittedly
unsatisfactory
work.
now,
may
we
start
from
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
don't
know
whether
it's
relevant
to
what
will
be
unfolded
by
you,
but
the
statement
also
is
there
that
the
strike
was
in
protest
against
the
discharge
of
an
admittedly
unsatisfactory
worker
and
there
was
a
provision
of
collective
agreement
saying
that
the
employer
reserved
the
right
to
discharge
any
man
under
his
employ
if
his
work
is
not
satisfactory.
like
this
--
like
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
union
may
not
have
admitted,
but
was
there
a
determination
by
a
--
by
an
agreed
upon
tribunal,
the
would-be
arbitrator
that
he
was
unsatisfactory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
sentence
of
the
court
is
that
the
strike
was
in
protest
for
something
which
if
true
there
was
no
justification
for
the
strike.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
perhaps
i'm
intervening
at
the
wrong
time
but
would
on
your
assumption
that
this
was
an
arguable
right
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
would
the
finding
of
the
arbitrator
under
the
procedure
--
is
that
part
of
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
finding
of
the
arbitrator
that
welch
was
properly
discharged
because
of
being
incompetent,
whatever
that's
based
on,
would
that
be
binding
on
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
therefore
binding
on
the
employer
and
the
union
as
i
understood
you
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
binding
on
both
parties,
why
doesn't
that
the
case
out
of
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
(voice
overlap)
earlier
when
you
said
you're
not
going
to
argue
this,
but
on
reflection
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
it's
a
--
if
this
is
for
purposes
of
law,
an
admitted
incompetence,
admitted
unsatisfactory
employer
then
is
the
--
is
the
right
to
compel
his
reinstatement
a
protected
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
deemed
arguable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
unfair
labor
practice
that
you
would
want
to
argue
before
the
board?
the
only
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
employer
did
was
to
acquire
(inaudible)
and
you
say
that
to
discharge
an
incompetent
employee
was
within
his
rights,
what
unfair
labor
practice
does
the
employer
does
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
let
me
ask
you
this
--
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
a
protected
activity,
do
that
raise
in
light
of
the
fact
the
strike
was
to
secure
reinstatement
of
the
properly
discharged
employee
for
which
there
was
a
contract
provision.
would
that
raise
questions
of
facts
which
is
here
have
witnesses,
evidenced,
were
that
as
a
question
of
law?
what
if
--
what
--
what
would
the
national
labor
relations
board
be
deciding
whether
the
people
can
stand
the
--
it's
alright
to
strike
if
a
fellow
is
discharged
who
concededly
properly
discharged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
would
be
the
issue
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
pure
question
of
law
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
the
--
the
record
bears
it
--
is
this
a
hy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
was
the
hypothesis
of
you
also?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
--
well,
i
was
going
to
speak
to
you
myself
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
if
you
have
nearly
an
arbitration
provision
or
an
arbitration
procedure,
no
more
than
that,
that
is
equivalent
as
though
they
didn't
say
the
foregoing
arbitration
procedure
does
not
surrender
the
right
to
strike
and
it
is
conceded,
of
course,
the
right
to
strike
you
deserve.
that's
what
you're
saying
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
merely
that
there's
an
implication
that
there
shouldn't
be
a
strike,
but
there's
an
implication
by
not
having
a
specific
no-strike
provision,
you
explicitly,
for
all
practical
purposes,
it's
what's
written
to
the
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
then
in
that
contract
from
which
he
is
charged
at
65
could
be
implied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
the
general
rule
that
people
at
65
were
no
good
--
after
65
were
no
--
is
that
a
physiological
fact
that
people
after
65
were
no
good?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
hesitate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
wasn't
any
--
there
wasn't
any
specific
provision
from
which
that
implication
could
be
drawn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
neither
of
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
there
is
no
specific.
what
i'm
asking
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
what
--
of
what
clause
could
the
restriction
against
firing
or
the
permission
to
fire
a
man
at
65,
of
what
clause
could
that
be
drawn
in
any
rational
discussion?
was
there
anything
in
that
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
may
not
be
--
it
may
not
be
proper
to
imply
it,
but
there
were
some
starting
point
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
starting
point
in
the
other
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
i
go
back
to
my
question.
there
must
be
some
implied
--
some
implication
that
65
is
a
cause
for
discharge.
now
that
might
be
--
that
might
be
--
has
involved
a
college
or
university
where
it's
rather
a
general
rule
to
retire
people
at
65.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
surgeons,
if
he
was
a
surgeon,
i
could
see
the
implication
there,
but
what
implication
is
there
that
we
haven't
yet
arrived
at
the
court
where
65
is
against
to
the
--
suspend
--
suspend
the
individual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
understand
you
concession,
because
if
you're
going
to
stick
in
the
(inaudible)
of
the
words
--
i
mean
the
words
are
there,
if
the
words
aren't
there,
there's
no
meaning
there,
which
goes
all
against
the
wisdom
of
interpretation
generally.
it
has
merely
said
that
there
shall
be
no
suspension
of
work
during
such
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
may
mean
the
next
day,
it
could
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you
say
it
would,
you'd
be
out.
i
don't
follow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
overstate
it.
i
want
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
i
find
out
--
if
you
tell
me
i'm
restricted
to
the
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
then
the
implications
are
opened
up,
even
though
it's
a
matter
of
bargaining.
and
you
know,
as
well
as
i
do
or
probably
better
that
not
one
of
the
--
that
one
of
the
most
frequent
reasons
for
not
putting
in
the
no-strike
clause
is
because
they
don't
want
to
use
those
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
common
to
me,
if
there's
any.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
it,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
it,
don't
you
mr.
hoague?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
merely
said
during
the
arbitration
and
if
--
if
we're
going
to
encrypt
it,
then
if
you've
got
a
restricted
suspension
of
striking,
i
should
think
the
implication
is
that
the
restriction
ceases
when
the
condition
ceases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hoague,
i
don't
want
to
ask
any
question
unless
that
would
be
coercive.
you
seem
to
be
able
to
take
care
of
yourself.
but
if
i
may
--
are
you
suggesting
--
are
you
suggesting
that
boston
is
the
only
place
where
everything
like
that
takes
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
are
you
suggesting
that's
the
only
place
where
such
things
take
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
by
force
of
the
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
stipulated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
--
unless
i
--
i
was
--
i
was
attentive,
but
i
didn't
hear
the
stipulation
to
which
you
refer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
the
suit
--
when
was
the
strike
began?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
take
if
the
court
had
before
it
the
agreement
which
included
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
included
an
obligation
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
ever
suggested
that
he
was
discharged
on
that
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
but
when
the
–
when
the
--
what
is
the
date
of
the
--
of
your
temporary
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
date
of
the
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
in
that
–-
in
that
answer,
did
they
set
forth
that
there
is
preemption
because
they
claim
that
the
discharge
was
in
violation
of
section
8?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
1959
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
ask
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
ask
about
mr.
justice
black's
question.
what
was
the
basis
of
the
defense
in
the
summer
of
1958?
justice
felix
frankfurter
arguable
afterwards,
in
the
garmon
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
this
case
is
here
on
the
basis
of
the
litigation
of
1959,
is
it
right?
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
could
--
even
assuming,
assuming
that
if
omnisciently
garmon
too
has
been
foreseen
by
counsel
and
has
been
raised
in
the
pleading,
and
therefore,
the
matter
should
arguably
have
gone
to
the
full.
what
i'm
asking
is
this
question.
could
counsel
by
free
willing
stipulation
or
agreement
not
change
the
course
of
the
litigation
which
arose
in
1959?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that
conferred
jurisdiction,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
i
understand
that,
but
couldn't
facts
or
the
ascertainment
of
fact
have
change,
which
changed
the
course
of
the
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
stipulation
was
in
september
of
1958,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
oles,
before
you
sit
down,
it
occurred
to
me
that
here,
unlike
the
freedom
you
have
under
the
--
what
you
tell
us
as
the
washington
procedure,
here
in
this
case
for
us,
you
will
have
to
differentiate
between
the
contract
and
the
tort
claim
so
far
as
the
301
suability
in
a
state
court
is
considered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this?
under
your
practice,
if
a
rehearing
is
allowed
before
the
--
what
you
call
the
intermediate
--
if
that's
the
name
for
which
the
panel
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
department.
thank
you
very
much.
are
rehearings
--
may
rehearings
be
granted
before
the
department?
may
a
petition
for
rehearing
be
filed
before
the
department?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
this,
my
question
is
this.
is
this
application
to
your
supreme
court
en
banc
like
a
petition
for
rehearing?
i
take
it,
i
don't
speak
by
the
book,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it's
necessary
before
a
person
comes
here
from
a
state
court
judgment
to
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
even
though
such
a
petition
is
trialable
i
suppose
in
every
country
in
the
land.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
this
the
same
as
a
petition
for
rehearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
this
can
be
reversed
by
a
larger
tribunal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
suppose
this
case
had
reasoning
in
your
court
of
--
united
states
court
of
appeals
or
circuit
--
what
is
your
circuit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
ninth
circuit.
suppose
that
this
had
been
before
a
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
there
was
then
--
a
person
can
come
here
directly
on
a
petition
from
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
wouldn't
be
an
answer
to
say
you're
the
first
to
ask
for
a
rehearing
en
banc
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
--
it's
the
court
that
has
the
reversing
power,
as
you
have
it
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
can
--
of
course,
from
the
court
of
appeals,
finality
is
not
a
requirement
as
you
point
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
had
a
question
like
this
coming
out
from
your
state
--
from
your
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
detain
you
a
minute
longer.
we've
had
some
cases
coming
here
from
--
in
fact
there's
one
question
in
my
mind
that
in
this
term
from
washington,
the
decision
is
very
(inaudible).
i
don't
mean
washington,
i
mean
missouri.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
brother
here
didn't
know
it.
but
i
think
they
withheld
that
you
have
to
go
through
a
--
through
the
whole
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
haven't
you
heard
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
they
still
go
there?
can
they
still
make
application
before
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
if
there
are,
do
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
should
have
gone
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
the
decision
of
the
appellate
division
in
new
york.
well,
i
have
agreed
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
a
justice,
but
i
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
this
judgment
that
can
rest
on
tort,
can
we
avoid
all
of
these
nice
subtle
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
meant
not
to
reference
to
that
problem,
in
reference
to
the
exclusive
--
with
reference
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
quite
right,
your
honor.
let
me
add
this
word
on
this
subject
because
it
--
i
think
it
should
be
said.
are
we
going
to
hold
that
it
is
the
law
that
a
union
can
agree
to
a
$3
wage
to
the
employees,
sign
it
solemnly,
and
the
next
morning
call
out
its
people
and
put
up
pickets
demanding
$4?
because
this
is
exactly
what
this
local
is
saying,
it
has
the
right
to
do
without
breaching
the
contract.
can
it
do
so
even
though
there
is
written
into
its
contract
an
arbitration
clause
which
says
that
matters
in
dispute
shall
be
arbitrated?
incidentally,
there's
been
some
argument
at
all
levels
of
this
case
that
after
all,
the
employer
didn't
demand
arbitration
to
start
with.
well,
of
course,
all
that
the
employer
was
doing
was
doing
what
he
had
an
expressed
right
to
do
and
do
it
to
discharge
a
man.
there's
nothing
in
the
labor
contract
that
says
you
shall
never
discharge
a
man
or
i
suppose
sell
some
flour
without
arbitration.
this
reaches
to
absurdity.
the
point
is
that
the
union
exercise
economic
power,
overwhelming
economic
power,
conclusive
economic
power
in
this
instance
to
force
an
employer
to
do
something
or
to
refrain
from
doing
something
which
he
had
a
clear
right
to
do.
or
for
that
matter,
could
an
employer
agree
to
pay
$3
an
hour
and
cut
the
wages
to
$2.
now,
if
the
man
wouldn't
agree,
lock
him
out.
because
again,
this
is
exactly
what
this
local
says
it
can
do
without
breaching
contract.
now,
i
recognize
that
this
court
is
confronted
daily
with
profound
and
difficult
conceptual
problems
particularly
in
this
empty
blackness
of
jurisdictional
lines
to
be
drawn.
i
recognize
that
this
court
has
to
deal
with
difficult
relationships,
but
i
also
and
reminded
constantly
in
sitting
here
that
this
is
the
supreme
court,
the
highest
court.
and
we
do
have
before
us
a
question
of
something
that
is
fairly
fundamental,
a
right
or
wrong.
unless
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
is
upheld
in
this
matter,
in
this
case,
a
real
and
genuine
injustice
has
been
done.
we
are
holding
that
in
effect,
this
respondent
has
no
remedy
and
no
solution,
unless
he
had
what
he
did
take
by
arbitration
and
subsequently
in
the
courts.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
duty
of
course
of
this
court
to
use
its
phrase
to
elucidate
in
litigation
these
difficult
areas.
it
has
of
course
also
a
higher
duty.
and
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
it
points
very
clearly
to
doing
justice
and
equity
in
this
case
and
thereby
affirming
this
rather
small
and
perhaps
to
this
union
a
rather
insignificant
little
judgement.
thank
you.

that's
1959.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
filed
in
1959.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
he
said
you
didn't
raise
it
until
after
the
stipulation
on
september
1958.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
raise
it
in
answer
to
the
complaint
filed
on
may
27,
1958?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
you
raise
it
before
the
thing
went
to
arbitration
in
september
of
1958.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
protectiveness
of
the
strike
was
the
question
of
whether
it
was
a
protected
activity,
whether
the
strike
was
a
protected
activity,
was
the
determination
of
that
question
unrelated
to
the
discharge
of
welsch?
justice
felix
frankfurter
welsch
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
strike?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
quality
of
the
discharge
is
on
whether
the
strike
was
a
protected
activity,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
connection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
may
not
limit
--
and
the
union
may
not
limit
its
right
to
strike
by
its
own
voluntary
action
and
say,
“you're
striking
because
--
you're
striking
because
you're
asking
us
to
reinstate
a
fellow
whom
we
admit
was
properly
discharged.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
is
the
question
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
question
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
the
--
whether
the
submission
to
arbitration
to
be
bound
by
it,
isn't
the
same
thing
as
saying,
“yes
we
agree
that
welsch
was
properly
discharged.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
just
trying
to
find
out
what
the
issues
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there
had
been,
suppose
they
said
after
the
litigation
got
underway,
we
agree
that
they
had
a
right
to
discharge
him,
we
agree
he
need
not
taken
back,
but
we
strike
so
that
you
should
take
him
back.
isn't
that
relevant
to
our
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
depends
because
there
was
a
provision
in
the
contract
that
they
may
discharge
a
properly
dischargeable
employee.
and
if
he
was
properly
dischargeable
and
they
agree
that
he
had
a
right
to
discharge
him
and
they
then
do
not
allow
him
to
enforce
that
agreement,
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
that
and
the
$3
and
$4.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
question.
that's
the
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
that
the
facts
on
which
the
--
if
you
agree
that
an
arguable
question
has
its
underpinning,
taken
away
because
the
facts
aren't
--
what
the
argument
can
be
based
on,
do
you
think
that's
irrelevant
to
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
parties
couldn't
agree
that
the
--
the
practice
--
the
parties
couldn't
agree
that
white
is
--
isn't
black,
was
it?
because,
once
the
board
has
jurisdiction,
that's
been
usable,
this
--
that
must
persist
through
all
its
synergy.
