justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand.
i
understood
you
to
say
it
with
mistakes
when
they
said
they
were
admittedly
unsatisfactory.
then
at
the
last
time,
you
said
you
would
say
that
you
admittedly
were
unsatisfactory
or
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice

black
not
determined.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
raising
the
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
raising
the
question
that
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
determine
that,
that
the
act
preempted
that
field
for
the
national
labor
relations
board?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
--
suppose
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
had
complained
to
the
board
or
the
company
complained
to
the
board
and
could
have
shown
quite
different
to
what
the
arbitrators
have
found
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
board
that
this
man
had
been
wrongfully
discharged,
would
that
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
not
--
had
been
discharged
because
of
discrimination
and
not
because
of
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
now
suppose
however
that
has
been
submitted
to
the
board
some
six
months
later
as
it
was
for
the
arbitrators
here,
the
board
had
found
against
you.
could
the
company
then
have
sued
you
for
having
to
strike?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
board
had
decided
the
question
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
against
you,
as
the
arbitrators
did
six
months
later.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
have
sued
you
on
the
ground
that
you
have
had
a
wrongful
strike
as
they
do
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
after
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
in
effect
are
you
not
claiming
that
there
was
a
preemption
but
you
didn't
have
to
wait
to
determine
the
liability
until
arbitrators
could
act,
that
this
would
suspend
the
operation
of
the
law
in
effect
simply
because
they
had
agreed
on
arbitration
and
is
the
question
whether
you
can
agree
to
that,
is
that
part
of
it,
so
as
to
change
the
results
that
would
occur?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
saying
that
the
right
to
sue
for
having
the
strike
should
not
depend
on
--
determinations
might
be
made
either
by
the
board
or
by
the
arbitrators
six
months
later.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
much
bargaining
going
on
now
in
circles
of
collective
bargaining
in
connection
with
surrendering
the
right
to
strike?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
contracts
provided
for
that
now
in
the
collective
bargaining
field
that
surrender
the
right
to
strike,
pending
something
like
arbitration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
a
constant
source
of
bargaining
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
the
question
of
arbitration
as
a
constant
source
of
bargaining.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
suppose
maybe
that
your
beginning
on
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
suppose
--
maybe
i
misunderstood
you
that
your
argument
is
that
there
is
no
part
of
this
contract
against
strikes.
that's
constantly
--
to
have
constantly
bargained
on
that
subject
and
put
them
in.
they
have
constantly
bargained
on
the
subject
of
arbitration
and
put
that
in,
and
you
say
that
from
that,
it
would
--
you
have
argued
that
it
would
be
a
practical
amendment
of
the
contract
to
imply
the
existence
of
something
which
is
well
known
in
the
bargaining
field
and
is
(inaudible)
guarded
against
as
--
given
they
have
the
right
to
strike.
justice

what
page
is
that?
208?
justice

it
involves

justice

do
you
mean
what
you've
just
read
on

how

we

how

we

how
do
we
know
that?
justice

l.
black
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
confess
that
my
brother
didn't
know
it
very
well,
but
i
was
not
familiar
with
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
they
--
you
admit
under
the
strong
question
of
my
brother,
that
it's
a
common
practice
for
labor
unions
that
then
can't
surrender
the
right
to
strike
and
say,
“we're
going
to
give
you
the
right
to
strike,
we
recognize
that,
but
we
don't
want
to
use
the
word,
surrendering
the
right
to
strike.”
do
i
understand
you
concede
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
up
in
boston?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
they
put
it
in
to
some
other
language
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
would
mean
the
same
thing,
i
can
understand
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
if
it
was
language,
i
suppose,
it's
pretty
clear
and
lenient,
wasn't
it?
do
you
mean
that
they
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
mean
that
the
garmon
case
leaves
it
in
delphic
mystery?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
mean
that
the
garmon
left
it
in
delphic
mystery?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
--
decided
by
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
have
any
effect
on
the
legal
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there's
not
any
challenge
to
the
fact
if
the
contract
was
made,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
legal
question
as
you
see
it
here,
different
to
the
ones
you've
stated
in
your
brief,
on
the
question
it
presented?
i
frankly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
do
not
quite
understand
yet
the
relevance
of
what
you're
saying
with
reference
to
the
legal
issue
we
have
before
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
can
understand
why
that
would
be
relevant
but
why
would
it
be
necessary
to
go
into
all
these
facts
if
that
legal
question
is
the
one
you're
presenting,
if
they
didn't
raise
that
question
early
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
--
i've
been
confused
as
to
what
you
consider
to
be
the
legal
issue
frankly,
that's
the
reason
i'm
asking
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
that
mean
prospectively
or
retroactively?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
as
i
understand
it
is
that
this
decision
rendered,
i
don't
know,
six
months
after
the
bill
was
filed,
after
it
is
tried,
this
decision
rendered
that
this
man
had
been
rightfully
discharged,
has
to
be
accepted
as
a
basis
to
decide
whether
the
court
was
originally
right
in
issuing
the
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
deprive
the
board
of
any
right
that
it
had
even
if
it
had
a
right
before
by
reason
of
the
--
there
being
an
issue
between
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
would
that
decide
whether
there
was
preemption
at
the
beginning
of
the
lawsuit
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
before
this
issue
was
decided,
when
that
was
the
question
that
the
strike
was
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
who
had
it
--
who
had
it
six
months
before
when
the
strike
started?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
time
the
strike
started.
who
had
the
right
to
pass
on
the
contro
--
labor
controversy
or
labor
dispute
that
was
in
(inaudible),
the
labor
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
vital
that
–
i
can't
–
that's
why
i'd
like
you
to
tell
why
that
is
not
a
vital
thing
and
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it's
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
board
didn't
found
that
there
had
been
an
unlawful
discharge
and
that
it
had
been
done,
i
mean
if
arbitrators
had
found

what
would
have
been
the
--
what
would
have
been
the
condition
then?
would
it

the
strike
have
been
justified,
i
mean,
unjustifiable?
justice

black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
original
answer?
justice
hugo

--
(voice

the
same
preemption.
what
was
their
defense?
justice

where
is
that?
what
was
the
defense
they
set
up
in
there?
justice

what
reason?
justice

would
that
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice

understand
that

been
able
to
make
my

clear
my

my
thoughts.
i
haven't
been
able
to
make
it
clear.
my
inquiry
is
this,
if
at
the
time
that
the
--
you
started
to
enjoin
this
trial,
they've
claimed
that
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
had
brought
this,
could
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
be
escaped
to
pass
upon
--
its
preemption
be
refused
or
rejected
because
six
months
later,
there
was
an
arbitration
which
decided
the
facts
in
a
way
that
the
board
might
or
might
not
have
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
legal
question
that
i'm
talking
about
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
deciding
something
which
had
been
decided
the
other
way
that
would
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
if
that
is
true,
why
did
not
the
board's
right
to
pre
--
the
power
--
preempt
state
power
at
the
time
this
proceeding
was
found?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice

we
have
to
decide
it,
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
say,
there
had
been
an
unfair
labor
--
justice

practice
by
the
company?
justice
hugo

they
said
in
fact,
would

say,
if
true,
would
have
shown
an
unfair
labor
practice.

(inaudible)

did
you

clear
and

one?

distinction?

difficulty

to

some
controversy
about
what's
remediable.
justice

did
the
arbitrators
interpret
it?
i
haven't
looked
at
it
carefully
as
i
should.
did
they
interpret
the
contract
meaning,
any
part
of
its
meaning,
that
the
right
to
strike
would
be
full
borne?
justice

it
was
moot
so
far
as
future
responsibility

consequences
was
observed.

conduct?

which
conduct,
the

you

it
had
the

determine
the
facts?
