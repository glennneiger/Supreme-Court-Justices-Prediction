mr.
francis
hoague
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
money
judgment
of
a
state
court
against
the
petitioning
union
and
in
favor
of
the
employer,
respondent
here
for
damages
--
based
on
damages
caused
by
a
strike.
the
respondent,
a
flour
broker,
had
a
union
shop
agreement
with
the
union
which
provided
in
part,
the
employer
reserves
the
right
to
discharge
any
man
in
his
employ
if
his
work
is
not
satisfactory.
this
action
had
its
origin
on
the
morning
of
may
12,
1958
when
an
elderly
employee,
jack
welch,
drove
a
forklift
truck
off
of
the
loading
dock
of
the
company,
dropped
some
five
feet,
injured
the
forklift
truck
and
injured
himself.
he
went
home
for
10
or
12
days
under
doctor's
care,
received
a
--
a
week's
accumulated
vacation
pay
and
when
he
received
his
vacation
check
(inaudible)
so
he
picked
it
up,
there
was
a
note
with
it,
which
your
honors
will
find
on
--
in
the
record
on
page
219,
memo
from
nick
lucas.
“jack,
the
enclosed
check
covers
your
second
week
of
vacation.
we
have
decided
that
it
would
be
better
to
take
the
next
--
to
take
next
week
off
for
part
of
your
vacation
and
then
should
we
be
busy
the
following
week,
i
will
call
you,
otherwise,
take
the
second
week
of
your
vacation
and
rest,
signed
pete.”
this
of
course
meant
to
welch
that
he
was
not
to
be
paid
with
this
vacation
without
pay.
he
went
to
the
union.
the
union
said
get
a
doctor's
--
a
note
from
his
doctor
saying
that
he
was
ready
to
return
to
work.
mr.
francis
hoague
pete
--
pete
was
an
official
of
the
company,
pete
onam
who
was
the
secretary
treasurer
of
the
company.
mr.
francis
hoague
not
of
minor
functionary,
he
was
an
official
of
the
company.
and
i
think
it
was
written
on
--
on
just
a
pad
of
paper
from
nick
--
it
said
from
the
desk,
“memo
from
nick
lucas.”
nick
lucas
was
the
vice
president
of
the
company.
mr.
francis
hoague
no
your
honor.
i
think
they
were
different
men.
they
were
both
officials
of
the
company,
both
officers
of
the
company.
mr.
francis
hoague
so,
he
came
back
--
let's
see,
he
came
back
with
a
doctor's
letter
saying
that
he
was
ready
to
work
to
the
company,
and
they
said,
“take
some
more
time
off.
we're
not
ready
for
you.
we'll
call
you
when
we
are
ready.”
since
he
had
seniority
over
other
men
in
the
plant,
he
went
to
the
union.
the
union
called
the
head
--
had
a
couple
of
telephone
calls
that
were
unsuccessful
in
straightening
out
his
difficulty.
and
on
may
27,
they
sent
down
--
in
the
morning,
sent
down
a
business
agent
with
welch
to
see
if
they
could
square
things
away.
when
the
business
agent
arrived,
the
meeting
was
opened
up
by
the
plant
officials
stating,
“jack
welch
is
discharged
as
of
today.”
and
they
asked
him
why,
he
said
for
unsatisfactory
service.
this
is
the
first
time
that
there
was
any
mention
of
the
discharge.
the
business
agent
phoned
back
to
the
union
and
they
sent
down
a
picket
banner
and
set
up
a
picket,
called
the
men
out
on
strike.
there
were
only
a
handful
of
employees
in
this
plant,
warehouse
actually
it
was.
mr.
francis
hoague
same
day,
yes
your
honor.
he
actually
called
him
within
the
hour.
they
called
the
men
out
on
strike
and
the
plant
shut
down
to
all
extents
and
purposes
for
eight
days.
the
strike
was
a
peaceful
one,
there's
no
violence,
no
mention
of
violence
or
threat
of
violence
in
the
strike.
the
court
found
that
it
was
essentially
a
one
man
picket.
the
strike
ended
after
eight
days
when
a
temporary
injunction
was
issued
by
the
state
court
in
this
action
that's
before
your
honors.
after
the
injunction
issued,
it
was
agreed
to
submit
the
matter
of
welch's
discharge
to
arbitration.
after
hearings
and
five
months
after
the
strike
had
ended,
the
arbitration
board
came
out
with
findings
that
welch's
services
had
been
unsatisfactory
for
some
years
and
this
was
the
climax
of
unsatisfactory
service.
it
also
found
in
--
these
findings
are
corroborated
by
the
trial
court
that
the
employee's
indecisive
attitude
towards
the
--
the
employer's
indecisive
attitude
towards
the
employee
made
it
difficult
for
the
union
to
understand
the
employer's
position
in
respect
to
the
sudden
discharge
of
an
employee
who
two
days
before
had
been
told
to
take
a
little
vacation
and
he
will
be
called
back
on
time.
it
said
that
if
it
hadn't
been
for
this
indecisive
attitude,
the
strike
would
never
have
assumed
it's
--
i
mean,
the
situation
would
never
have
assumed
its
proportions.
after
that
in
the
findings
--
there's
no
question
between
parties
here
that
the
findings
of
the
arbitration
board
are
final
and
conclusive
in
this
action.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
we
submit
that
that
is
a
misleading
statement.
when
they
say
admittedly,
they
mean
that
we
can't
controvert
it
at
this
time
because
we're
bound
by
the
finding
of
the
arbitrators.
it
wasn't
admittedly
at
the
time.
in
fact,
it
was
contested
very
seriously
that
we
wouldn't
have
gone
to
arbitration
if
it's
been
admitted.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
think
it's
relevant.
i
don't
think
there's
any
issue
as
to
his
unsatisfactory
service.
he
was
unsatisfactory
--
mr.
francis
hoague
but
i
do
think
it's
--
if
it
--
if
his
services
were
satisfactory,
i
don't
believe
we'd
be
here.
the
trial
court
after
the
trial
--
mr.
francis
hoague
your
honor
at
this
time
we
have
to
admit
that
they
were
unsatisfactory
because
we're
bo
--
bound
by
the
findings
of
the
arbitrators.
at
the
time
of
the
strike
it
was
--
mr.
francis
hoague
i've
--
i
hope
i've
made
this
clearly
because
this
is
--
this
is
an
important
issue
of
a
distinction.
we
admit
it
now
because
we
can't
deny
it.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
like
to
get
it
out
of
my
mind.
mr.
francis
hoague
i'm
--
i'm
glad
that
you
state
your
concern
about
this
because
i
--
i
want
to
get
it
out
of
your
mind,
too.
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
strike,
there
was
a
very
serious
dispute.
the
union
disputed
the
question
as
to
whether,
well,
they
insisted
that
welch's
work
was
satisfactory.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
i
think
that
--
mr.
francis
hoague
there
were
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
hoague
i
think
there's
no
question
there
would
--
for
the
basis
for
a
strike
of
that
and
we
--
we
submit
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
correct.
but
isn't
--
mr.
francis
hoague
not
unless
one
of
your
honors
is
still
under
the
impression
that
at
the
time
that
the
strike
was
called,
we
admitted
the
--
the
union
admitted
that
--
that
his
work
was
unsatis
--
mr.
francis
hoague
there
was
five
months
later,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
it's
exactly
--
mr.
francis
hoague
i
submit
that
that's
misleading
and
wrong.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
we
raise
that.
that's
one
of
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
one
of
--
that's
one
of
the
two
questions
involve
in
this
appeal.
mr.
francis
hoague
no.
in
order
to
--
there's
a
specific
finding
that
by
the
trial
court
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
and
i
--
this
is
on
page
187
of
the
record
that
it
--
his
purpose
was
to
compel
the
plaintiff
to
rehire
welch.
mr.
francis
hoague
to
com
--
mr.
francis
hoague
well,
to
punish
is
one
thing
and
to
compel
him
to
rehire
is
another,
one
might
be
punitive.
the
--
where
was
i?
at
the
trial
--
after
the
trial,
the
state
court
found
that
the
--
gave
judgment
for
some
$6500
against
the
union.
now
on
the
--
on
the
basis
of
tort
on
the
ground
that
the
strike
was
coerced
--
illegal
and
coercive,
this
--
these
words
have
become
words
of
our
--
in
labor
law
in
the
state
of
washington
when
judgment
is
granted,
it's
granted
against
the
union,
it's
because
their
action
has
been
coercive.
if
it
--
if
judgment
is
in
favor
of
the
union,
it's
--
their
action
or
picketing
is
persuasive
and
that
those
are
the
two
--
two
distinctions.
from
this
tort
judgment,
we
appealed
and
the
state
supreme
court
affirmed
the
judgment
on
a
dual
basis,
on
two
grounds.
one
in
tort
that
the
strike
was
an
attempt
to
force
the
employer
to
forego
his
exercise
of
--
the
exercise
of
his
right
to
discharge
welch
for
unsatisfactory
service,
and
as
to
that,
we
of
course
raise
the
point
as
to
the
tort
action,
the
state
courts
were
preempted
by
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board.
as
to
that,
they
said
preemption
was
no
problem
because
this
was
neither
a
protected
activity
to
strike;
it
was
neither
a
protected
activity
nor
a
prohibited
activity
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
the
second
ground
was
that
this
was
a
common
law
breach
of
contract
as
to
section
301
despite
the
fact
that
we
cited
the
linc
--
this
court's
decision
in
lincoln
mills
case.
they
said
that
section
301
was
obviously
purely
a
jurisdictional
provision
and
did
not
affect
the
substantive
law
involved.
and
therefore,
they
were
free
to
apply
local
common
law.
now
unless
this
court
wishes
otherwise,
i'm
not
--
i
do
not
intend
to
spend
much
time
on
the
tort
aspect
of
the
supporting
opinion
of
the
court
below
because
i
deal
with
this
--
it's
so
obvious
that
this
falls
within
the
san
diego
build
--
building
trades
against
garmon
as
at
least
an
arguably
protected
activity.
and
therefore,
the
initial
jurisdiction
play
in
the
labor
board
to
determine
whether
the
terms
of
this
contract
waived
the
protection
of
the
act.
the
more
novel
question
is
the
common
law
breach
of
contract.
as
i
say,
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
says
that
--
said
that
30
--
section
301
of
the
act
did
not
affect
the
substantive
law
and
therefore
they
are
free
to
apply
local
law.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
lincoln
mills
decision
specifically
decided
that
section
301
supplanted
inconsistent
local
law.
we
do
submit
that
it
almost
necessarily
follows
from
this
court's
decision
in
lincoln
mills
case
because
if
you
have
in
this
case
two
inconsistent
laws
governing
the
same
contract
and
potentially
51
inconsistent
laws
governing
a
national
labor
contract,
it
would
result
in
chaos.
perhaps
a
stronger
argument
for
this
proposition
lies
in
the
fact
that
if
a
matter,
say
a
strike
or
any
form
of
labor
activity
is
not
forbidden
under
that
contract
by
section
301
applied
to
the
labor
contract,
then
it
could
be,
in
many
cases
would
be,
a
protected
activity.
and
if
the
state
law
said
that
this
would
be
penalized
by
money
judgment
or
by
an
injunction,
this
would
be
a
clash
of
jurisdictions
between
state
and
federal
and
of
course
federal
should
prevail.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
well,
this
--
i
--
i'll
answer
that
quickly
and
i
--
mr.
francis
hoague
well
--
mr.
francis
hoague
there's
no
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
at
least
there's
no
--
the
fact
that
a
person
was
properly
fired
doesn't
mean
that
a
strike
to
reinstate
him
is
--
the
strike
to
enforce
his
reinstatement
is
improper.
there
--
mr.
francis
hoague
you
mean
what
wouldn't
be
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
we're
not
claiming
that
he
was
guilty
of
any
--
any
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
right.
mr.
francis
hoague
this
is
shown
--
excuse
me.
there
are
numbers
of
cases
on
page
17
of
my
brief,
cusano
against
the
labor
relations
board,
national
labor
relations
board
against
mcketron.
i
had
these
five
cases
there
in
which
--
in
which
there
was
a
discharge
for
completely
justifiable
reasons.
the
union
jumped
to
erroneous
conclusions,
called
a
strike
and
all
the
strikers
were
fired.
this
is
to
in
--
each
of
these
cases,
the
labor
board
ordered
reinstatement
because
they
said
this
was
collective
activity.
mr.
francis
hoague
no.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
no.
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
no,
no.
but
i
--
with
regard
to
the
preemption
matter
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
absence
of
a
no
strike
provision
makes
it
at
least
arguable
that
there
was
no
waiver
of
the
right
to
strike.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
yes,
entirely.
the
--
this
--
the
determination
as
to
whether
a
no-strike
provision
will
be
implied
is
just
another
factor
to
be
taken
into
account
in
the
--
by
the
labor
board
in
--
in
--
in
assessing
the
factual
legal
complex
which
is
going
to
result
in
their
decision
as
to
whether
this
is
a
protected
activity
or
it's
not
a
protected
activity.
and
if
the
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no
they
--
that's
already
been
determined
as
to
--
by
the
labor
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
hoague
the
issue
--
the
issue
before
the
labor
board
is
--
did
the
union
waive
its
right
to
strike
under
these
circumstances,
strike
for
the
purposes
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
which
the
strike
would
be
wrong
--
i
should
think
so.
there
might
be
some
facts
involved
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
oh,
going
into
the
intent
of
the
contract.
mr.
francis
hoague
this
your
honor,
this
court
has
looked
into
the
intent
of
--
into
the
background
of
contract.
i
think
it
was
(inaudible)
--
background
of
contracts
in
the
lion
oil
case.
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
not
necessarily
discriminatory
discharge.
mr.
francis
hoague
on
account
of
union
discrimination.
mr.
francis
hoague
then
of
course
it
would
have
been
(inaudible)
--
mr.
francis
hoague
and
the
board
had
decided
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no
i'd
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
no
your
honor.
i
don't
--
because
--
mr.
francis
hoague
certainly,
the
rightfulness
or
wrongfulness
of
this
strike
--
mr.
francis
hoague
at
that
time
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
shouldn't
depend
on
what
was
--
is
going
to
happen
five
months
later.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
correct.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
is
another
factual
issue
that
i
--
i
see
in
this
case
that
would
be
presented
to
the
board
and
that
is
the
question
as
to
regardless
of
whether
the
work
was
unsatisfactory,
did
the
union,
in
fact,
did
the
employer,
in
fact,
mislead
the
union
into
thinking
because
of
its
--
its
clumsy
method
of
discharge
into
thinking
that
this
was
an
attempt
to
discriminate.
and
this
i
think
is
a
factual
issue
that
could
have
been
--
could
be
raised
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
francis
hoague
this
was
--
mr.
francis
hoague
this
is
--
this
was
a
real
hypothesis
which
was
decided
against
me
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
francis
hoague
but
it
was
an
issue
that
was
contested
at
great
length
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
right.
and
we
say
that
that
should've
been
decided
by
the
labor
board
and
not
by
the
trial
court
as
far
as
--
as
far
as
the
tort
liability
is
concerned.
the
--
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
the
labor
board
often
does
take
into
consideration
interpretations
of
contracts
in
determining
whether
--
there
--
whether
an
action
on
the
part
of
--
of
a
union
is
a
protected
activity
or
is
not
a
protected
activity.
the
fact
that
this
is
a
contract
involvement
here
rather
than
a
factual
involvement
doesn't
make
it
a
more
--
a
less
labor
board
type
of
a
matter
to
be
determined.
the
--
in
the
mastro
plastics
case
against
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
in
national
labor
relations
board
against
lion
oil
company
in
both
situations,
the
labor
board
considered
and
interpreted
the
contract,
the
labor
contract
in
determining
that
a
strike
was
a
protected
activity
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
your
honor,
since
it's
within
one
minute
--
mr.
francis
hoague
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
court.
your
honors,
will
remember
that
this
is
a
case
based
on
a
strike
to
force
the
reinstatement
of
a
discharged
employee
who
five
months
after
the
strike,
it
was
determined
by
arbitration
to
have
been
unsatisfactory
in
his
service
to
his
employer.
i
would
like
to
address
my
remarks
this
morning
toward
the
contract
aspect
on
which
the
court
below
based
its
opinion
in
its
judgment.
mr.
francis
hoague
the
--
mr.
francis
hoague
well,
i'm
trying
to
decide
whether
i
should
go
to
that
right
now
or
not.
mr.
francis
hoague
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
--
i
think
i'll
go
to
the
contract
and
come
back
to
the
tort
because
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
interrelationship
between
them.
we
start
of
with
the
realization
that
the
heart
core
of
both
the
wagner
and
taft-hartley
acts
is
congress'
faith
in
the
process
of
collective
bargaining.
they
felt
that
if
unions
were
protected
in
organizing
and
collective-bargaining
was
made
available
to
them
by
law
that
the
free
flow
of
commerce
would
be
eventually
fostered
by
the
results.
the
congress
did
not
make
any
effort
to
--
they
were
not
interested
in
what
the
results
of
collective
bargaining
were
in
the
sense
of
what
the
terms,
the
substantive
terms
of
the
contract
would
be.
they
felt
that
that
was
up
to
the
parties
whether
the
contract
resulted
in
terms
that
were
harsh
or
easy,
or
for
the
employer
or
for
the
union
or
the
employees
was
a
matter
of
their
relative
bargaining
strength
of
the
justice
of
--
with
which
they
were
able
to
bargain
at
the
table,
and
that
was
left
to
the
parties.
in
other
words,
in
looking
at
the
contract
from
the
--
with
the
wagner
and
taft-hartley
acts
in
mind,
the
intent
of
the
parties
was
the
matter
--
was
the
thing
that
should
govern
rather
than
some
preconceived
notions
of
congress
as
to
what
should
be
in
the
contract.
this
of
course
does
not
apply
to
the
closed
shop
provision
which
is
outright,
but
as
to
the
other
terms,
that
was
up
to
the
parties.
so
in
looking
at
the
contract,
we
try
to
carry
on
--
out
the
intent
of
the
parties
and
try
to
ascertain
what
the
intent
was
from
a
realistic
standpoint.
it
also
was
obvious
--
it
is
obvious
from
the
congressional
reports
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
very
common
use
of
the
no-strike
clause
expressed
in
contracts.
it
certainly
--
all
surveys
show
that
most
--
the
great
majority
of
contracts
contained,
expressed
no-strike
clauses.
it
was
also
--
the
history
shows
that
congress
considered
that
the
no-strike
clause
would
be
included
in
the
contract
or
excluded
from
a
contract
as
a
result
of
collective
bargaining.
they
hoped
that
the
no-strike
clause
would
be
included
in
a
contract
because
that
would
normally
lead
to
industrial
fees,
but
it
was
to
be
included
or
excluded
as
a
result
of
bargaining.
our
prime
objection,
our
sort
of
basic
objection
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
is
that
the
court
was
unwilling
to
look
to
the
intent
of
the
parties
in
the
contract.
they
were
unwilling
to
give
sway
--
full
sway
to
the
process
of
collective-bargaining
where
they
felt
that
the
contract
should
contain
a
strike
prohibition,
a
no-strike
clause,
they
attributed
a
strike
prohibition
to
the
contract
without
regard
--
without
regard
to
whether
a
no-strike
provision
was
to
be
implied
from
a
contract.
they
state
that
expressly.
they
say
it
is
not
necessary
to
imply
a
strike
prohibition.
mr.
francis
hoague
i'd
like
to
come
to
that
little
later,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
a
very
important
part.
now,
with
respect
to
our
position
is
that
strike
prohibitions
are
not
to
be
imported
to
a
contract
or
not
to
be
attributed
to
a
contract
unless
they
are
to
be
found
in
the
intent
of
the
contract
from
a
realistic
standpoint.
we
--
many
times
it
has
been
said
that
the
arbitration
provision
is
the
quid
pro
quo
of
the
no-strike
clause
or
--
it's
generally
stated
the
other
way,
that
the
no-strike
clause
is
the
quid
pro
quo
of
the
arbitration
provision,
and
this
is
a
proper
statement
when
there
is
no
strike
provision
and
there's
no
arbitration
provision.
it
--
or
when
talking
about
the
subjects
to
be
negotiated
at
the
bargaining
table,
one
is
very
frequently
the
quid
pro
quo
of
the
other.
on
the
other
hand,
in
looking
at
a
contract
to
determine
whether
a
no-strike
provision
should
be
implied,
it
certainly
is
improper
to
say
where
there
is
an
arbitration
provision,
a
no-strike
provision
will
be
implied.
in
the
first
place,
if
that
so,
fairness
and
logic
would
say
when
there
is
a
no
strike
provision
and
there's
no
arbitration
provision,
we
will
imply
an
arbitration
provision
and
yet
nobody
would
say
that.
the
--
mr.
francis
hoague
a
great
deal
of
good
in
--
by
having
it
in
there,
it
--
people
will
--
the
parties
will
resort
to
arbitration
and
do
commonly
resort
to
arbitration
without
a
no-strike
provision.
this
sets
up
the
arbitration
procedure.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
but
they'd
have
to
setup
the
procedure.
this
is
--
this
is
something
that
has
been
worked
out
in
advance
just
like
what's
the
point
of
having
a
grievance
procedure
short
of
arbitration,
people
can
go
to
arbitration
you
say.
well,
people
normally
do
use
a
grievance
procedure
before
they
go
to
arbitration
because
it's
been
setup
there,
even
though
it's
not
required
to.
even
though
they
can
say
you're
not
interested
in
a
preliminary
grievance
procedure.
the
--
i
can
--
there's
a
very
--
there
is
undoubtedly
something
very
attractive
about
saying,
“when
there's
an
arbitration
provision,
necessarily,
there
is
a
strike
prohibition.”
i
submit
that
this
frustrates
the
intent
of
the
parties
when
the
parties
decide
that
there
is
not
--
that
they
will
not
put
in
a
no-strike
provision.
the
intent
should
govern
regardless
of
the
attractiveness
of
a
--
implied
a
no-strike
--
a
strike
provision
implied
in
law
rather
than
in
fact.
mr.
francis
hoague
you're
stating
--
mr.
francis
hoague
i
think
that
the
case
of
united
states
steel
corporation
against
nichols
has
--
is
--
raises
a
situation
that
is
applicable
here.
in
that
case,
the
‘shoe
is
on
the
other
foot.
the
employer
was
--
employee
was
suing
his
employer
to
--
for
damages
because
he
was
discharged
--
he
was
retired
at
the
age
of
65
and
he
said
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
did
not
reserve
to
the
employer
the
right
to
discharge
him
at
65.
actually,
the
agreement
said
nothing
about
it.
and
--
well
they
--
the
court
for
the
sixth
circuit
court
properly
said
that
is
something
that
isn't
dealt
with,
and
therefore
its
right
back
where
it
would
be,
the
situation
is
just
as
if
there
had
been
no
contract
in
this
respect.
mr.
francis
hoague
well
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
no.
i
wouldn't
hesitate
but
i'm
getting
very
close
there
myself.
mr.
francis
hoague
and
we
submit
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
we
submit
in
this
contract,
there
is
no
specific
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
what
your
honor
said.
mr.
francis
hoague
no.
i
think
the
court
was
right
and
i
think
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
the
court
was
wrong
here
to
do
--
to
imply
it
from
this.
mr.
francis
hoague
alright,
here's
a
starting
--
mr.
francis
hoague
oh,
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
well,
as
i
remember
it,
general
terms
about
not
discharging
people
except
for
cause,
that
was
one
(inaudible)
--
mr.
francis
hoague
well,
i
think
--
mr.
francis
hoague
well,
this
is
one
of
the
allegations
was
that
he
was
--
he
was
still
able
to
handle
his
job
and
therefore
he
was
not
being
discharged
for
a
cause
and
they
said
to
the
court
--
and
i
think
quite
properly
said,
“since
this
wasn't
covered
in
the
agreement,
it
should
be
left
the
way
it
was
in
the
--
it
would
be
in
the
absence
of
the
agreement,”
and
i
submit
that
the
same
thing
should
be
done
here.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
your
honor.
not
as
much
as
there
was,
say,
two
decades
ago.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
your
honor.
in
my
brief,
i
cite
the
bureau
of
national
affairs.
a
study
that
was
made,
page
29
of
my
brief
which
showed
--
28
--
that
from
a
1957
survey
--
four
of
--
it
surveyed
400
representative
contracts
and
found
that
89%
of
them
contained
some
form
of
expressed
no-strike
agreement,
37%
provided
an
absolute
ban
on
strikes,
52%
were
conditioned
on
various
internal
procedures
or
events.
mr.
francis
hoague
constantly,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
think
that
can
be
said
too,
yes.
and
your
honor
will
remember
in
lewis
against
benedict
coal
company,
in
the
mead
case,
teamsters
against
mead,
they
had
a
no-strike
provision
and
bargained
it
away
to
eliminate
it.
now,
i
want
to
get
--
mr.
francis
hoague
excuse
me
--
mr.
francis
hoague
i
think
that's
particularly
true
mr.
justice
black,
in
view
of
the
fact
the
if
we
turn
to
page
208
of
the
record,
there
is
the
arbitration
provision
and
it
starts
off
with
the
first
paragraph
which
refers
to
the
arbitration
as
to
the
interpretation
of
this
agreement.
and
your
honors
will
notice
that
the
last
sentences
said,
“it
is
further
agreed
by
both
parties
hereto
that
--”
mr.
francis
hoague
208,
“that
during
such
arbitration,
there
shall
be
no
suspension
of
work.
that
is
a
no-strike
provision
as
to
arbitration
of
an
interpretative
issue.
it
goes
on
to
the
second
paragraph
and
says,
“should
any
difference,”
that
means
any
other
difference
i
assume,
“arise
between
the
employer,
the
same
should
be
submitted
to
arbitration,
and
as
to
such
that
they
omit
that
no
suspension
provision.”
mr.
francis
hoague
no.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
never
been
argued.
i
think
it's
conceded.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
right.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
true.
i
will
concede
this,
that
if
it
falls
within
the
first
--
mr.
francis
hoague
the
first
--
first
as
an
interpretative
issue.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
your
honor.
now
here,
the
question
wasn't
what
the
meaning
of
the
contract
was.
the
question
was
whether
this
man's
services
were
unsatisfactory?
and
they
--
when
it
came
to
arbitration
and
the
arbitration
opinion
which
is
in
the
record,
states
that
there
is
no
issue
as
to
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no
question,
no
question.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
don't
think
is
much
of
a
burden,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
issue
on
that.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes
sir,
i
realize
that.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
--
i
realize
that.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
think
you're
overstating
my
position.
i
don't
say
--
mr.
francis
hoague
my
position
is
we
should
look
and
try
to
find
out
what
the
intent
was
with
reference
to
strike.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
think
that's
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
very
common,
yes.
but
the
fact
that
they
did
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
did
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
put
it
in.
mr.
francis
hoague
what?
mr.
francis
hoague
well
--
mr.
francis
hoague
this
--
this
--
mr.
francis
hoague
this
--
mr.
francis
hoague
i
know
that
this
has
happened.
mr.
francis
hoague
but
this
was
put
in
--
in
paragraph
once,
so
that
they
did
use
it
there.
they
did
not
used
it
in
--
mr.
francis
hoague
i
concede
that
this
was
done
up
in
boston.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
when
the
teamsters
negotiated
their
agreement,
they
cut
out
the
word
--
they
cut
out
a
closed
shop
provision
and
yet
put
in
a
--
mr.
francis
hoague
they
put
in
some
other
language.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
right.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
yes.
they
said
in
that
case,
in
that
contract
which
is
an
important
contract.
they
said
that
matters
should
be
exclusively
settled
by
arbitration
or
different
issues
should
be
exclusively
settled
in
arbitration.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
the
only
place
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
no
i'm
not.
i'm
suggesting
that's
the
only
place
i
know
of.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
hoague
my
concession
may
have
been
a
little
too
much.
i
didn't
think
if
it
really
mattered
when
i
was
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
francis
hoague
i'll
have
to
answer
that
yes
and
no.
i
can't
--
the
court
did
not
order
us
to
arbitrate.
they
said,
“if
arbitration
didn't
happen
and
other
things
would
happen,
we
would.”
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
both
parties
i
think
were
coerced
by
the
--
into
arbitrating
and
i
think
it
was
a
good
thing
by
the
--
by
the
temporary
injunction.
mr.
francis
hoague
after
the
injunction,
the
company
agreed
to
arbitrate.
mr.
justice
whittaker
asked
me
to
talk
on
preemption.
i
do
want
to
save
a
little
time
for
rebuttal.
i
wonder
if
your
honor
would
allow
me
to
refer
to
my
brief
as
far
as
preemption
and
i
just
--
i'm
frightened
to
leave
no
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
francis
hoague
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
somewhat
shocked
to
hear
mr.
oles
say
that
we
did
not
raise
the
preemption
issue
until
the
end
of
the
case,
until
after
the
case
was
over.
and
the
answer
on
page
15
of
the
record,
we
have,
“and
for
further
affirmative
defense,
we
set
out
the
entire
facts
going
to
interstate
commerce.”
mr.
francis
hoague
but
this
was
--
mr.
francis
hoague
your
honor,
i'm
correcting
mr.
oles'
statement
that
we
didn't
raise
this
issue
until
after
the
case
had
been
tried.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
heard
him
say
that
it
wasn't
until
we
made
our
motions
for
judgement
notwithstanding
the
oral
opinion.
in
the
brief
that
we
submitted
--
mr.
francis
hoague
on
page
15
going
over
to
16,
we
alleged
that
the
business
of
the
respondent
affects
--
substantially
affects
interstate
commerce
in
industrial
strife
and
unrest
would
and
did
affect
and
burdening,
obstruct
interstate
and
territorial
commerce.
now,
the
obvious
purpose
for
this
was
to
raise
the
preemption
issue
and
under
our
practice
there,
we
allege
--
at
that
time,
allege
the
facts
and
not
law
--
if
we
had
alleged
that
jurisdiction
was
in
the
labor
board,
it
would
have
been
stricken
as
a
conclusion
of
law.
this
third
affirmative
answer
raised
that
issue
and
in
the
memorandum
of
authorities
submitted
to
the
trial
court
at
the
--
on
the
first
day
of
trial
which
is
not
in
the
printed
record
but
is
in
the
unprinted
record,
we,
as
the
third
issue
--
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
hoague
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
hoague
it's
in
the
answer.
we
said
that
the
jurisdiction
is
in
--
no,
that
we
pleaded
to
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
it
would
strike
everything
except
the
facts
under
the
old
practice
at
the
time.
now,
since
then,
the
federal
rules
have
been
adopted.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
set
out
--
mr.
francis
hoague
set
out
as
an
issue
of
fact
that
they
--
in
allegation,
that
they
affected
interstate
commerce.
this
was
denied
by
reply
and
then
we
stipulated
that
it
did
affect
the
interstate
commerce.
and
i
argued
in
my
brief
peaceful
picketing
for
mutual
aid
and
protection
as
secured
by
the
taft-hartley
act
and
states
cannot
declare
it
illegal,
i
cite
weber
against
anheuser-busch.
i
quote
the
much
quoted
thing
if
this
conduct
does
not
fall
within
the
prohibitions
of
section
8,
it
may
fall
within
the
purposes
of
section
--
protection
of
section
7.
and
i
cite
garner
against
the
teamsters,
international
union
against
o'brien,
amalgamated
association
against
wisconsin
employment
board,
i
say
this
doesn't
fall
within
the
russell
and
laburnum
cases,
these
was
all
raised
at
the
outset
of
the
trial
and
that
it's
absolutely
incorrect
to
say
that
it
wasn't
raised
by
the
pleadings.
it
also
--
mr.
francis
hoague
i
can't
answer
that,
i
don't
know,
i
don't
remember.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
can't
answer
that
either,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
don't
think.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
hoague
there
certainly
--
we
never
stipulated
and
the
arbitration
board
never
undertook
the
question
as
to
whether
the
strike
was
a
protected
activity,
and
we
submit
that
it
still
was
a
protected
activity,
looked
at
from
hindsight
or
foresight.
it
was
a
protected
activity,
should
have
--
the
matter
should
have
gone
to
the
labor
board
to
determine
whether
it
was
--
mr.
francis
hoague
--
a
protected
activity.
mr.
francis
hoague
yes.
mr.
francis
hoague
oh
no
your
honor,
of
course
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
strike.
mr.
francis
hoague
but
the
discharge
of
him,
a
strike
to
reinstate
a
person
who
is
properly
discharged
is
not
a
wrongful
illegal
strike,
and
furthermore
i'd
like
to
remark
that
--
mr.
francis
hoague
no,
not
unless
--
mr.
francis
hoague
not
unless
it's
a
--
it
was
a
discriminatory
unfair
labor
practice
strike.
every
economic
strike
is
to
force
an
employer
to
do
something
that
he
has
a
right
not
to
do.
every
economic
strike
forces
him
or
it
is
intended
to
force
him
to
grant
higher
wages,
to
submit
to
this
sort
of
procedure
as
to
seniority,
and
so
on.
all
of
which
he
has
a
right
not
to
do.
mr.
francis
hoague
they
didn't
make
any
such
statement,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
hoague
there
was
no
such
admission.
mr.
francis
hoague
there
was
no
such
admission.
mr.
francis
hoague
i
--
mr.
francis
hoague
because
--
mr.
francis
hoague
time
--
mr.
francis
hoague
because
is
time
is
short,
i
will
have
to
refer
your
honor
to
the
footnote
on
page
18
in
which
i
discussed
this
business
of
the
admission.
there
was
no
admission
at
the
time
that
he
was
--
he
was
--
excuse
me.
that
he
was
--
mr.
francis
hoague
yes,
and
that
is
--
that
is
on
the
matter
of
mr.
oles'
suggestion
as
to
them
making
an
agreement
for
a
$3
wage
and
going
out
right
to
the
next
day.
that
would
be
a
repudiation
of
the
contract.
this
was
not
a
repudiation
of
the
contract,
but
was
an
effort
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
contract
which
were
--
mr.
francis
hoague
they
didn't
agree
that
--
mr.
francis
hoague
of
course,
your
honor,
there's
no
question
about
that.
it
couldn't.
the
board's
jurisdiction
cannot
be
conditional
on
some
subsequent
arbitration.
either
--
mr.
francis
hoague
i
think
that
the
board's
jurisdiction
either
existed
at
the
time
of
the
strike,
or
it
didn't
exist
at
the
time
of
the
strike,
and
nothing
that
could
happen
subsequent
could
--
mr.
francis
hoague
take
it
away.
mr.
francis
hoague
determine
whether
this
was
--
mr.
francis
hoague
well
actually,
it
has
to
end
and
actually,
there
were
--
there
were
a
lot
of
facts
that
were
determined
in
the
arbitration,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
francis
hoague
it's
very
kind
of
you
your
honor,
i
would.
the
--
in
the
case
decided
by
this
court,
national
labor
relations
board
against
mackay
radio
company,
there
was
a
strike
to
enforce
a
contract,
to
get
it,
to
obtain
a
contract.
the
--
this
court
held
that
--
and
the
strikers
were
fired
immediately.
this
court
held
that
the
wisdom
of
the
strike
was
not
an
issue.
it's
a
protected
activity
whether
it
is
wise
or
unwise.
that
is
by
the
taft-hartley
act
is
left
to
the
parties
to
determine
what
action
they
will
take,
and
i
submit
that
this
is
a
proper
way.
perhaps
the
strike
was
unwise
from
hindsight
to
--
i
guess
--
i
guess
it
was.
at
that
time,
it
did
not
seem
so
unwise,
nevertheless,
that
is
a
concerted
activity,
and
the
cases
that
i
have
cited
on
page
17
of
my
brief
were
all
cases
where
the
union
went
out
on
a
strike
to
get
a
man
reinstated.
fairly
foolishly
they
went
out
on
a
strike
and
still
they
held
that
that
was
a
concerted
activity
and
was
protected
by
the
act.
and
that
the
strikers
could
not
be
fired.
they
could
be
replaced
as
your
honors
know.
but
short
of
replacement,
they
could
not
be
fired
and
they
were
reinstated.
and
this
has
been
the
rule
all
through
it.
that
being
so,
the
issue
as
to
--
the
issue
as
to
whether
this
was
a
protected
activity
which
doesn't
come
down
to
just
the
item
of
the
--
that
was
determined
by
the
arbitration
board
but
comes
down
to
what
the
union
had
reason
to
believe
was
happening.
in
other
words,
did
the
--
did
the
employer
mislead
the
union
into
thinking
that
they
had
to
go
out
on
strike
and
the
arbitrators
stated
this
and
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court
stated
that
they
were
so
mislead,
that
was
an
issue
that
should
have
been
decided
not
by
the
trial
court,
but
by
the
labor
board.
thank
you
your
honor.
