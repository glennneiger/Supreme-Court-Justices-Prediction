mr.
stuart
g.
oles
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
first,
let
me
address
the
court
on
the
issue
which
counsel
for
petitioner
asserted
yesterday
is
so
clearly
in
his
favor
as
to
require
no
discussion
in
which
he
has
suited
the
action
of
the
word
by
not
discussing
it.
this
is
the
old
issue
of
preemption,
an
area
which
this
court
has
declared
to
be
wrapped
in
delphic
mystery.
now
briefly,
this
is
whether
the
rule
in
the
garmon
case
applied
here
to
deprive
the
courts
of
the
state
of
washington
of
initial
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
this
case
at
least
insofar
as
it
related
to
tort.
now
that
rule
in
the
garmon
case
may
be
simply
stated
as
i
understand
that
case
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
pardon
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
it
--
well,
this
is
a
question
that
i
would
rather
leave
for
this
court
to
decide
sir.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
at
least
as
applied
here,
i
believe
that
the
rule
is
clear,
and
i
think
that
rule,
and
i
say
that
in
humility,
i
think
the
rule
is
that
whenever
a
state
court
has
before
it,
whether
in
tort
or
in
contract,
condone
which
is
either
clearly
or
fairly
to
be
assumed
to
be,
or
arguably
it's
protected
by
section
7
or
condemned
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
section
8
of
the
taft-hartley
law,
that
the
state
court
should
in
that
instance
defer
to
the
initial
jurisdiction
of
the
specialized
tribunal
of
congress
created
to
deal
with
these
matters,
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
we
don't
believe
that
counsel
is
very
serious
in
asserting
that
their
conduct
in
this
matter
was
condemned
by
section
8
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
they
have
nowhere
asserted
just
what
section
--
what
part
of
section
8
they're
violating.
i
believe
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
counsel
that
question
directly
yesterday
and
said
just
what
part
do
you
mean?
he
received
no
answer
and
we
have
received
no
answer
throughout
these
proceedings.
we
think,
however,
if
there
is
any
thrust
of
their
argument
at
all,
it
relates
to
their
contention
that
their
conduct
was
arguably
protected
by
the
mutual
aid
and
protection
language
of
section
7
of
the
act.
so
this
is
the
question
to
which
i
would
like
to
direct
my
first
remarks.
i
think
that
by
reviewing
a
few
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
will
become
apparent
that
at
the
time
this
matter
was
presented
to
the
state
court,
and
the
state
court
was
asked
to
defer
to
the
initial
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
it
was
not
a
matter
that
could
be
fairly
assume
to
be
or
even
arguably
conduct
protected
by
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
moreover,
it
is
our
position
that
this
statement
is
based
on
facts
which
had
already
been
found
and
stipulated
to
before
the
state
court
was
asked
to
defer
to
the
alleged
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
the
facts
have
been
pretty
well
outlined
from
time
to
time
but
some
of
them
have
been
overlooked.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i'm
about
to
document
why
i
say
that.
lucas
of
course
is
a
wholesale
flour
dealer
with
three
or
four
employees,
local
174,
and
i
think
it‘s
important
to
remember,
it's
an
enormous
local
union
with
400
or
500
such
contracts
such
as
we
are
dealing
with
here.
collective
bargaining
in
the
sense
that
it
is
being
used
by
counsel
is
not
a
very
descriptive
term
of
what
goes
on
here.
the
exhibit
1,
which
is
the
contract,
will
be
shown
to
be
a
mimeographed
piece
of
paper,
with
the
blank
for
the
name
of
the
employer,
and
the
collective
bargaining
consists
of
signing
and
staying
in
business
or
not
signing
and
staying
out
of
business.
there
is
no
other
choice
presented
or
suggested.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
assume
that
some
of
the
big
dealers
in
this
business
actually
negotiate
this
contract,
i
don't
know.
i
only
know
that
lucas
flour
company
has
never
asked
to
negotiate,
nor
is
there
any
suggestion
in
the
record
that
it
does.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
think,
your
honor,
in
a
general
way,
all
of
the
facts
and
background
are
a
substratum
of
any
decision
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
face
the
facts
as
this
court
dealt
with
it.
and
specifically,
i
think
that
we
are
also
concerned
with
whether
this
union
acted,
acted
in
such
a
way
as
to
violate
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
acted
as
they
can
in
good
faith.
i
think
the
relative
bargaining
power
does
have
some
applications.
this
is
particularly
true,
mr.
justice
black,
because
counsel
has
just
finished
an
argument
based
on
what
he
said
is
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
this
contract.
now,
i
submit
that
the
intent
must
be
found
from
the
objective
instrument
before
us
in
the
light
of
the
labor
policy
enunciated
by
this
and
other
courts,
not
upon
any
actual
implied
or
imputed
intent
which
actually
the
parties
never
had
at
all.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
none
at
all,
none
at
all
your
honor.
we
are
concerned
with
what
it
means.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
and
when
we're
concerned
of
what
it
means,
we
could
as
in
the
case
of
congress,
search
back
to
the
congressional
record
to
see
what
they
said.
here,
of
course,
i'm
submitting
that
we
do
not
have
that
avenue
of
research
open
to
us.
now
here,
melvin
welsch
is
the
name
of
this
employee,
he
had
been
employed
by
lucas
about
two
years.
he
was
incompetent,
so
incompetent
as
to
be
dangerous
not
only
to
himself
but
to
the
company
and
his
fellow
employees.
the
union
would
not
let
him
be
fired,
not
just
on
this
occasion
but
the
record
shows
on
numerous
occasions
prior
to
this
date
when
the
company
tried
to
fire
this
man.
the
union
said
you
fire
him
and
we'll
close
you
down.
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
union
had,
as
i
submit,
imposed
a
contract
upon
this
employer
which
reserved
to
the
employer
the
right
to
discharge
unsatisfactory
employees.
now
all
of
these
of
course
is
why
the
employer
in
the
ultimate
act
to
discharge
hemmed
and
hawed
considerably,
before
reaching
the
decisive
decision
only
when
the
union
business
agent
called
him
up
as
the
records
shows,
and
said
either
you
take
him
back
to
work
we're
going
“shut
your
joint
down”
as
the
record
indicates
without
dispute.
now,
it
was
this
tyrannical
conduct
which
finally
triggered
the
discharge
which
led
to
this
strike.
not
because
the
other
employees
were
unhappy,
the
undisputed
testimony
is
that
the
other
employees
agreed
with
management
but
welsch
was
incompetent
and
dangerous,
but
nonetheless
they
were
called
off,
they
stayed
home
and
the
company
was
shut
down,
there
were
no
deliveries
allowed
in
or
out.
in
fact
the
vice
president
of
this
local
and
its
principal
business
agent
personally
chased
one
of
the
officers
of
this
company
when
he
tried
to
load
a
few
sacks
of
flour
into
his
automobile
and
deliver
them
about
to
town,
chased
him
around
town
until
he
got
lost
in
the
traffic.
why
such
enthusiasm
to
keep
this
one
incompetent
employee
when
400
or
500
such
contracts
exist
in
the
seattle
area
with
this
vast
local.
i
don't
think
we'll
ever
know
the
interior
answer
to
that
although
counsel
has
urged
at
every
level
that
their
motives
were
pure.
i
do
know
that
there
was
evidence
undisputed
that
perhaps
this
company,
the
lucas
flour
company
had
offended
the
union,
because
it
had
employed
a
man
called
lawrence
anderson
who
had
the
(inaudible)
to
be
one
of
the
group
who
are
seeking
an
audit
of
the
books
of
the
union
in
a
totally
separate
action.
and
although
he
was
a
member
in
good
standing,
the
union
tried
to
get
him
fired.
and
the
union
--
the
company
would
not
fire
this
man
simply
because
he
had
a
quarrel
with
the
union
officials,
and
this
very
possibly
is
why
the
court
decided
at
all
levels
that
the
union
did
not
act
for
mutual
aid
and
protection
as
a
matter
of
subjective
motive.
as
i
shall
say
in
a
moment,
i
don't
think
subjective
motive
has
anything
to
do
with
it,
but
the
counsel
so
asserted
it
was
their
principal
defense
at
the
trial
of
this
case.
now
continuing
our
chronology
of
what
occurred,
and
here,
i'm
trying
to
lay
before
this
court,
the
pictures
that
actually
was
presented
to
the
state
courts,
the
suit
was
brought
in
may
1958,
immediately
after
the
strike
began,
and
there
were
various
proceedings
in
and
out
of
court,
pleadings
filed
affidavits.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
very
frankly,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
commence
the
suit
under
the
practice
in
the
state
of
washington
which
permits
you
to
state
a
claim
without
identifying
the
theory
in
which
you
are
bringing
it
which
i
think
is
also
the
principle
of
federal
practice
modernly.
very
candidly,
we
hope
we
would
win
on
one
ground
at
least.
to
our
happiness,
we
won
on
both,
and
have
there
been
some
third
ground,
we
would
have
asserted
that
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
all
we
pleaded
i
think
you
will
find
is
the
facts
and
hope
they
would
bring
us
within
some
recognizable
area
of
the
law.
this
may
not
be
an
answer.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
don't
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i'm
about
--
i
think
mr.
justice
black
to
answer
your
question
when
i
point
out
that
in
these
initial
proceedings
before
the
state
court,
no
claim
was
made
of
lack
of
jurisdiction.
the
assertion
that
has
now
been
made
and
is
now
being
argued
in
this
court
was
not
made
in
1958
at
any
time
in
any
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
they
did
not
raise
it
early
enough
because
factually,
the
matter
had
already
been
decided
by
stipulation
by
the
time
they
raised
it.
this
is
our
position.
i
feel
perhaps
incorrectly
that
this
is
part
of
the
background
and
i
have
completed
the
discussion
of
these
facts
which
i
think
are
part
of
the
background
which
i
think
to
myself
at
least
are
essential
to
give
us
a
full
understanding
of
what
happened.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
haven't
come
to
it
yet
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
confess
i
haven't,
but
i'm
about
to
assert
it
i
trust.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
the
stipulation
sir
was
made
in
september
of
1958,
and
again,
it
is
necess
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
may.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
you
see,
this
is
why
i
think
it's
necessary
to
trace
the
chronology.
the
suit
was
in
may
following
the
strike
immediately.
the
court
issued
an
injunction
which
was
conditioned
upon
the
party's
arbitrating.
the
union
in
its
response
to
the
action
for
an
injunction,
asserted
as
its
prime
defense
that
this
matter
should
be
arbitrated,
not
asserting
that
it
had
demanded
such,
but
simply
saying
it
should
be.
the
employer
did
not
disagree,
and
accordingly,
the
matter
was
in
affect
agreed
by
both
parties
that
the
injunction
would
be
dependent
upon
an
arbitration
taking
place.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
it
had
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
correct.
and
the
court
felt,
the
trial
court
at
that
level
which
is
--
this
of
course
is
not
the
case
from
which
an
appeal,
not
the
proceeding
from
which
an
appeal
is
taken,
but
the
arbitration
came
about
because
in
the
affidavits
in
connection
with
an
injunction,
it
appeared
to
the
court
that
there
was
an
arbitration
clause.
the
injunction
was
granted.
the
strike
stopped
and
the
parties
stipulated
in
addition
to
what
the
court
had
ordered
that
there
would
in
fact
be
an
arbitration.
that
stipulation
is
set
forth
in
the
record.
and
specifically
at
page
210
of
the
record,
it
says
--
and
this
is
what
the
party
has
stipulated
to.
“it
is
further
stipulated
and
agreed
that
the
decision
of
the
three
arbitrators
when
reached
shall
be
final
and
binding
upon
all
parties
hereto,”
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
if
they
--
only
two
agree,
the
decision
of
the
two
shall
be
final
and
binding.
so
that
in
september
of
1958,
it
was
stipulated
between
the
parties
that
the
issues
on
the
merits
would
be
decided.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
that
answer
is
very
simple
mr.
justice
black,
because
there
was
nothing
prospectively
to
be
concerned
with
at
that
stage.
mr.
welsch,
the
employee
in
question
had
already
decided
to
retire
and
taken
retirement
before
this
stipulation
was
entered
into.
this
is
specifically
decided
by
the
board
of
arbitrators.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
real
issue
although
it
states
whether
he
would
be
entitled
to
be
reinstated
as
an
issue.
in
fact,
there
was
none.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
even
the
injunction
mr.
justice
black,
was
then
become
moot.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
there
would
be
no
factual
issue
left
to
be
decided
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
our
position,
that
the
parties
in
september
of
1958
–-
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
think
i
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
keep
in
mind
sir,
that
we
are
not
concerned
with
a
rule
that
says
state
courts
have
no
jurisdiction.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
a
state
court,
and
the
garmon
case
makes
this
clear,
and
counsel
has
not
asserted
otherwise,
is
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
the
initial
exclusive
power
to
make
determinations
in
the
areas
within
its
competence.
my
point
is
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
can't
say
who
had
before
the
strike
started.
i
only
know
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
this
is
asking
me
a
question
that
i
could
not
predict
the
answer
to.
have
the
employer
filed
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
the
reason
it
isn't
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
the
reason
it
isn't
vital
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
parties
agreed
instead
by
stipulation
to
submit
the
merits
of
the
controversy
to
a
board
of
arbitrators
and
to
agree
to
be
bound
by
the
result
of
that
finding
of
that
board.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
frankly,
i
don't
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
frankly,
i
suppose
that
they
would
have
had
to
find
out
what
the
reason
was
for
the
discharge
and
i
suppose
that
it's
theoretically
possible
that
a
board
could
have
found
that
this
employer
had
discriminated
against
this
man
because
of
his
union
activity
which
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
which
conceivably
is
a
matter
which
again
the
nlrb
could
have
decided
in
the
first
place.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
they
so
asserted
in
front
of
the
board
of
arbitrators
at
length.
this
was
the
whole
heart
of
their
argument
before
the
board
of
arbitrators.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
in
-–
in
may
or
early
june
of
19
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
there
were
three
complaints
and
three
answers
and
the
first
case
came
to
issue
on
the
first
complaint,
i
would
say
in
the
early
summer
of
1958.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
absolutely
no.
no
preemption
was
ever
asserted
until
may
1959,
a
year
after
the
strike,
simply
because
they
had
agreed
to
stipulate
to
an
arbitration
and
they
didn't
like
the
results
of
it.
and
when
that
failed,
they
went
to
court
and
tried
to
retry
it
there
on
the
third
of
minute
complaint
and
the
answer
thereto
in
march
of
1959,
and
they
lost
there.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
the
original
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
their
principal
defense
to
the
first
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
your
honors
will
find
that
the
record
has
not
included
in
being
sent
out,
the
pleadings
other
than
under
the
second
amended
complaint
which
is
the
–
of
course
the
case
--
a
decision
on
which
is
now
on
appeal
here.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
and
that's
in
1959.
none
of
the
1958
pleadings
are
as
far
as
i
know
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
--
before
this
court.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
their
defense
was
--
number
one,
that
this
man
had
been
discharged
because
of
some
other
reasons.
they
had
various
theories,
not
that
he
was
unsatisfactory.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
one
reason
they
asserted
was
that
this
was
to
get
even
with
him
because
he
complained
to
the
union.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
don't
think
there's
any
question,
but
that
would
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice.
they
asked
the
court,
however,
to
decide
this.
they
asked
the
arbitrators
to
decide
this.
they
argued
this
matter
and
presented
180
pages
of
testimony
on
this
issue
to
a
board
of
arbitrators.
this
is
a
very
long
record
in
front
of
the
board,
much
longer
than
before
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
well
of
course,
to
be
fair,
the
garmon
case
had
not
yet
been
decided.
whether
the
law
was
already
so
--
is
–
it's
perhaps
arguable,
it
seemed
to
be
arguable
when
the
garmon
case
was
heard
here.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
well,
i
will
not
object
myself
mr.
justice
frankfurter
into
that.
i
do
point
out
that
in
the
fall
of
1958
when
the
arbitrators
met,
they
decided
and
i
quote
from
page
217
of
the
record,
“the
majority
of
the
board
is
firmly
of
the
view
that
welsch's
work
was
unsatisfactory
to
the
employer.”
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
that
there
was
a
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
well
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
you're
asking
mr.
justice
black
for
a
knowledge
that
nobody
had
and
–
for
a
declining
of
jurisdiction
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
--
which
nobody
asked.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
you
see,
nobody
asked,
nobody
asserted,
nobody
contended
that
there
was
lack
of
jurisdiction.
nobody
referred
to
the
fact
that
this
was
protected
or
violated
by
federal
law.
nobody
asserted
the
taft-hartley
law
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
no.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
no,
no
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
they
set
out
facts,
which
if
true,
would
have
constituted
conceivably
an
unfair
labor
practice,
something
which
frankly,
i
did
not
know
at
the
time
and
which
counsel
did
not
raise
and
which
was
never
presented
to
the
board
of
arbitrators
or
anyone
else.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
yes.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
well,
of
course
the
only
thing
that
the
parties,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
can
stipulate
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
you
can't
stipulate
jurisdiction.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
this
is
precisely
our
position
that
by
the
time
the
matter
was
presented
to
the
superior
court
of
king
county,
state
of
washington,
at
that
point,
the
facts
had
already
been
conclusively
stipulated
and
decided.
and
those
facts
as
conclusively
stipulated
and
decided,
did
not
present
conduct
which
was
arguably
or
could
fairly
be
assumed
to
be
a
violation
of
or
protected
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
is
why
i
started
to
quote
what
the
board
of
arbitrators
decided.
the
board
of
arbitrators
decided
that
this
man
was
unsatisfactory,
that
he
was
fired
for
that
reason,
that
he
was
fired
in
good
faith
for
that
reason.
and
i
repeat,
too
often
perhaps,
that
this
had
been
stipulated
too
in
advance,
that
the
parties
would
be
bound
to
these
facts.
therefore,
by
the
time
in
may
1959,
when
for
the
first
time
they
asserted
that
there
was
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
superior
court
of
king
county,
the
facts
presented
to
them
were
not
arguably
or
could
fairly
be
assumed
to
be
anything
but
what
they
had
been
stipulated
to
be.
this
so
issue
before
the
trial
court
on
the
case
which
is
now
before
this
court
was
damages.
how
much
money
should
the
union
have
to
pay
this
employer,
for
what,
under
the
admitted
facts
was
a
breach
of
contract.
now,
there
was
another
issue
injected
into
it.
it
was
asserted
by
the
union
at
the
time
of
the
trial
as
an
additional
defense
that
its
motives
were
good.
its
subjective
motives
were
good.
we
objected
with
vigor
on
the
ground
that
that
was
irrelevant.
and
parenthetically,
let
me
say
that
it's
quite
obviously
is
if
you
reverse
the
positions,
supposing
the
board
of
arbitrators
had
decided
this
man
was
wrongfully
discharged
because
he
was
not
unsatisfactory
and
was
not
discharged
for
that
reason,
would
it
be
a
defense
to
lucas
flour
company
in
a
suit
brought
by
mr.
welsch
for
several
months
of
lost
wages
that
the
employer
thought
the
man
was
unsatisfactory?
quite
obviously
not.
we
are
forced
to
deal
with
the
objective
intent
of
the
parties
under
this
contract
and
it
was
decided
by
the
arbitrators
that
the
man
was
unsatisfactory
and
dis
–
and
discharged
for
that
reason.
in
any
event,
the
court
heard
the
testimony
on
the
motives
and
decided
even
that
issue
against
the
local
saying,
“as
a
matter
of
fact,
its
subjective
motives
were
other
than
mutual
aid
and
protection
and
then
awarded
damages.”
stating
in
it's
decision,
as
the
record
shows
that
actually,
it
shouldn't
even
heard
the
matter
on
the
motives
and
that
the
only
issue
before
had
been
damages.
and
of
course,
it
is
our
point
that
it
was
until
after
that
memorandum
decision
of
the
trial
court
was
issued
that
for
the
first
time,
this
union
said,
“you
don't
have
jurisdiction.”
the
initial
determination
of
the
facts
should
go
before
the
nlrb.
that's
what
they
said
and
that's
what
they
say
now
after
they
had
lost
at
every
level
including
the
arbitration
which
they
stipulated
would
be
final,
conclusive,
and
binding.
so
it
is
simply
our
position
that
at
the
time
they
raised
the
question,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
defer
it
to.
it
could
not
be
initially
deferred
to
a
body
which
had
no
jurisdiction
at
all
since
the
facts
had
already
been
decided.
let
me
note
here
that
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
they
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
they
served
upon
our
office
in
may
of
1959.
it
wasn't
–-
it
wasn't
filed
until
july
of
1959.
i
don't
know
the
reason
for
that.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
in
the
–
the
decision
was
rendered
in
november
of
1958.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
the
stipulation
to
hold
an
arbitration
and
to
be
bound
by
it
was
in
september
of
1958.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
in
the
late
fall
of
1958,
i
would
-–
i
have
to
check
the
record
but
i
would
say
around
october
or
november.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
frankly
don't
remember
mr.
justice
brennan,
whether
it
was
before
or
after,
the
--
it
was
contemporaneous
with
this
arbitration
because
we
anticipated
that
we
would
succeed
in
the
arbitration.
and
as
a
result
of
it,
we
asked
for
damages,
dropped
the
injunction
which
all
parties
agreed
was
now
moot.
the
union
didn't
intend
to
strike
anymore,
it
was
through
with
that.
it
relied
on
the
arbitration
to
settle
the
merits.
i
think
they
were
surprised
at
the
results.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
intend
to
discuss
that
sir.
let
me
note
this
much.
the
counsel
--
the
only
law
that's
applicable
to
this
question
and
still
talking
about
preemption
for
a
moment
and
the
tort
claim
is
that
the
protection
of
section
7
is
withdrawn
if
the
strike
is
in
violation
of
a
contract.
i
note
that
counsel
has
stated
it
very
well
on
page
18
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
citing
authority.
“it
is
of
course
true,”
he
says,
“that
the
protection
is
withdrawn
if
the
strike
is
in
violation
of
an
existing
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
if
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
yes.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
yes,
it
is.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
after
the
case
was
tried.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
the
answer
to
that,
you
will
notice,
does
not
raise
any
issue
and
the
answer
is
found
at
page
11
of
the
record.
the
answer
sets
forth
–-
no
contention
that
there
was
lack
of
jurisdiction
although
presumably
they
now
argue
that
this
is
the
result
of
it.
they
did
not
so
argue
with
them.
now
--
what
--
may
i
ask
further,
could
the
washington
court
be
expected
to
do
when
this
motion
was
presented
to
it?
all
it
really
had
decided
is
the
damages
were
to
be
allowed.
something
which
of
course
it
cannot
defer
to
the
nlrb
because
the
nlrb
has
no
jurisdiction
to
award
damages,
it's
not
concerned
with
it.
had
this
contention
been
made
of
the
outset
of
the
case
conceivably?
conceivably,
have
they
shown
that
this
was
a
matter
arguably
protected
or
fairly
to
be
assumed
to
be
conduct
protected
by
section
7.
at
that
stage,
the
court
might
very
well
have
deferred
the
jurisdiction
to
the
nlrb,
an
action
or
a
proceeding
could
have
been
initiated
by
the
employer
in
the
–-
in
the
local
office
of
the
nlrb
and
perhaps
if
we
convince
the
regional
council,
some
sort
of
an
injunction
would
be
issued
to
stop
the
strike.
by
the
time
this
contention
was
raised,
however,
and
for
the
first
time
in
the
superior
court
of
king
county,
already
the
strike
was
over
and
was
moot,
the
injunction
was
moot,
the
trial
court
so
states
at
the
outset,
the
facts
had
become
agreed
and
stipulated.
the
only
matter
that
was
left
was
damages.
the
employer
had
no
complaint
to
file
at
that
point.
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
then
being
committed
by
the
-–
by
the
union.
the
union
has
never
asserted
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
committed
by
the
employer
in
those
terms.
and
certainly,
did
not
so
argue
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
this
case.
they
are
asking
the
state
of
washington
to
defer
to
a
tribunal
which
did
not
have
and
i
don't
see
any
way
in
which
they
could
have
obtained
jurisdiction
or
heard
the
matter.
so,
all
i'm
asserting
is
that
they
stipulated
to
wait
any
contention
that
factually,
this
matter
could
be
fairly
assumed
or
arguably
protected
by
section
7
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
now
there
are
other
issues
in
this
case
and
there's
two
i
would
like
to
dispose
very
quickly.
one
is,
was
this
protected
or
was
this
condemned
by
section
8
and
i've
already
i
think
answered
that.
there
is
nothing
in
section
8
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
renders
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
which
was
done
by
the
union
in
this
instance.
they
only
raised
this
argument
for
the
first
time
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
where
they
said,
as
they
have
said
here,
“our
conduct
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.”
but
they
haven't
shown
why
or
how.
and
frankly,
i
can
only
do
what
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
does
if
you
will
review
what
they
say
since
nothing
is
said
in
the
briefs
or
in
argument
to
support
this
contention.
the
state
of
washington
supreme
court
prints
in
its
entirety
in
the
opinion
the
section
8
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
condemning
certain
unfair
labor
practices
by
the
union.
it
says,
“here
they
are.
we
have
read
them.
we
don't
see
anything
remotely
relating
to
the
kind
of
conduct
which
is
the
subject
of
this
suit.”
i
don't
know
how
anybody
could
arrive
at
a
different
conclusion
in
reading
it.
now,
another
argument
or
issue
in
this
case
on
which
i
don't
wish
to
spend
any
time
is
the
question
of
whether
they
failed
to
exhaust
the
remedies
below.
i
merely
reiterate
to
this
court
what
is
obvious
that
there
was
available
to
this
union,
a
petition
for
rehearing
before
all
nine
judges
of
the
state
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
there
is
no
urgency
shown,
no
reason
shown
why
they
should
not
have
taken
that
remedy.
i
suspect
in
all
deference
and
in
some
sympathy
to
counsel
that
very
likely
he
overlooked
it.
i
don't
know
his
reason.
i
do
know
that
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
it
is
a
routine
technicality
which
would
have
been
futile.
many
of
such
petitions
are
granted.
it
is
no
more
futile
than
in,
for
instance
a
state
which
has
intermediate
appellate
court,
where
the
right
to
this
–-
to
be
heard
before
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
rest
on
discretionary
power
in
a
state's
supreme
court.
surely,
no
applicant
to
this
court
for
certiorari
could
justifiably
assert
that
it
would
be
futile
–-
“i'm
not
likely
to
get
it
anyway,”
and
say,
that
the
court
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
yes.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
do
not
believe
--
oh,
it's
a
final
judgment,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
a
certiorari
to
the
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
it
was
not
heard
before
nine
judges
of
that
court.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
the
practice
is
that
within
30
days
after
a
department
hears
a
case,
that
is
a
department
consists
of
four
judges
plus
the
chief
justice.
within
30
days
thereafter,
a
written
petition
for
rehearing
maybe
filed
with
the
court
asking
that
the
matter
be
heard
en
banc
that
is
before
all
nine
judges.
such
a
rehearing
is
automatically
granted
if
the
decision
of
the
department
was
three
to
two.
it
is
sometimes
granted
when
it
was
four
to
one.
and
i
understand
about
4%
of
them
are
granted
if
it
was
five
to
zero
as
it
was
in
this
case.
i
wouldn't
concede
that's
futile,
but
i
will
admit
that
the
chances
were
reasonably
remote
that
it
would
have
been
granted.
but
nonetheless,
they
fail
to
file
such
a
petition.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
the
department,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
as
i
read
the
rules,
this
is
within
the
depth
and
scope
of
the
statute
and
the
rules.
that
is
that
there
could
be
such
a
rehearing.
i
think
i
can
state
confidently
in
practice.
it
is
never
been
done
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
of
course.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
no,
it
is
not
for
this
reason,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
by
a
larger
tribunal.
we
call
them
petitions
for
rehearing
customarily
and
i'm
falling
into
that
language.
it
is
in
technically
a
petition
for
hearing
en
banc
is
what
we
call
it
and
entitle
it.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
believe
not.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
simply
because
your
statutory
authority
of
this
court
to
hear
appeals
from
the
court
of
appeals
is
most
specific
as
i
understand
it,
upon
what
constitutes
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
from
which
a
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
yes.
here,
we
are
concerned
with
a
statute
which
as
i
understand
it
says,
“appeal
from
the
highest
court
of
the
state.”
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
and
i'm
simply
asserting
that
for
the
purposes
of
that
statute,
the
highest
court
surely
is
the
nine
judges
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
no
question
about
that.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
no.
actually,
what
happens
again
and
again,
we
publish
washington
decisions,
a
paperbound
booklet
of
departmental
decisions.
again
and
again,
we
will
find
that
these
--
that
en
banc,
our
state
supreme
court
changes
that
decision
and
it
will
appear
at
the
bottom
--
this
opinion
will
be
withdrawn,
it
will
be
replaced
by
one
en
banc.
sometimes
this
doesn't
get
out
in
time
to
appear
in
the
printed
leaflet,
but
there's
no
question
that
it
is
an
affirmative
act
of
reversing
or
overruling
a
decision
of
a
department.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
this
has
never
been
raised
in
this
court
out
of
the
state
of
washington
as
far
as
i
know.
i'm
quite
confident
it
has
never
been.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
examined
it
with
care
through
the
shepard's
citator
and
i
can
find
no
subsequently
determination
that
has
any
existence
at
all
to
this
question.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
from
missouri.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
would
assume
so.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
--
a
matter
so
intimately
within
the
--
within
the
scope
and
concern
of
this
court,
i
hesitate
to
express
an
opinion
on
it,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
real
heart
of
the
matter
is
if
this
court
to
hear
matters,
barring
some
sort
of
urgency
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
a
state
which
has
solemnly
being
asked
to
be
overruled
hasn't
really
had
a
shot
at
it.
oh,
i
suppose
that
the
judges
of
the
state
supreme
court
read
all
their
own
decisions
of
other
departments.
but
they
haven't
really
had
a
shot
at
this
one.
and
i
submit
that
before
the
--
this
court
say
that
you
are
wrong,
they
should
be
speaking
to
all
nine
and
not
just
to
four
plus
the
chief
justice.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
no,
no,
30
days
sir,
is
the
limit.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
they've
been
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
have
to
say
they
should
have
gone
there.
it's
too
late
now.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
so,
if
he
doesn't
go,
it's
too
late.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
yes,
frequently.
and
this
has
occurred
to
me
this
term
that
sua
sponte,
the
court
simply
issued
an
order
in
saying
we
are
transferring
this
en
banc,
for
a
hearing
en
banc
after
it
already
been
heard
before
the
department.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
no
opinion
had
been
rendered.
i
assume
that
they
split
two
and
three.
i'm
guessing.
i
would
like
to
know
which
were
the
two
and
which
were
the
three,
but
i
don't
know.
now,
let
me
turn
if
i
may
to
the
more
serious
question
of
breach
of
contract
which
is
correctly
been
pinpointed
here
yesterday
as
an
alternative
ground
for
the
upholding
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
either
tort
or
contract
supports
the
judgment.
now,
in
the
dowd
case
which
was
argued
yesterday,
it
was
asserted
by
the
petitioner
that
section
301
deprives
the
state
court
of
all
jurisdictions
over
breaches
of
contract
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
interstate
commerce.
and
i
can
only
say
as
to
that
since
i
haven't
been
asked
to
argue
that
case
that
i
read
its
briefs
and
hardly
accord
with
the
brief
filed
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
amicus
curiae.
i
feel
compelled
because
the
result
in
that
case
would
have
such
an
effect
upon
this
one,
they
had
one
comment.
it
was
argued
in
that
case
with
much
bigger
that
congress
expressly
grants
state's
jurisdiction
over
a
federally
created
causes
of
action
when
this
is
intended.
and
there
he
cited
section
303
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
i
can
only
respond
that
this
is
because
the
substantive
jurisdiction
of
state
courts
to
try
any
federal
offense
derives
any
federally
created
cause
of
action,
derives
from
congress.
the
right
to
try
a
suit
for
breach
of
contract
in
the
state
of
washington
does
not
derive
from
congress.
it
is
the
historic
jurisdiction
of
the
states.
it
is
so
ancient
and
so
firmly
established
that
surely
it
would
require
an
expressed
statement
by
congress
to
the
contrary,
to
deprive
them
of
that
jurisdiction,
and
this
i
think
is
a
distinction
in
which
if
i
may
say
with
difference
to
counsel
in
that
case
should
have
been
made.
and
i
make
it
now
only
because
i
sat
camping
at
the
bench
in
the
corner
listening
to
it.
now,
returning
to
argue
with
my
own
case
rather
than
that
one,
here,
the
petitioner
only
argues
that
the
lincoln
mill's
decision
substituted
federal
common
law
for
a
state
contract
law.
and
both
sides,
i
noticed
in
the
dowd
case,
took
the
same
position.
so
i
find
myself
one
against
four
because
i
don't
agree
that
that
is
what
the
lincoln
mills
case
said
at
all.
that
was
a
case
brought
in
federal
court
under
section
301
which
conferred
jurisdiction
substantively,
remedially
or
procedurally
makes
no
difference
which
in
fact
conferred
jurisdiction
upon
federal
courts
to
try
breaches
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
interstate
commerce.
it
was
a
case
of
that
sort
and
the
issue
before
this
court.
and
the
issue
which
as
i
understand
that
was
decided
in
this
court
is
to
what
law
should
govern
that
kind
of
a
case.
there
is
no
discussion
in
the
lincoln
mills'
decision
or
in
any
of
the
opinions
filed
with
it
which
states
what
law
should
be
applied
to
a
state
court
determining
under
its
historic
jurisdiction,
the
breaches
of
contract
cases
that
come
before
it.
in
other
words,
the
lincoln
mills
case
created
--
said
that
section
301
created
not
only
a
form,
a
new
form,
for
such
cases,
but
also
a
new
remedy,
a
substantive
remedy.
it
said
nothing
at
all
as
i
read
the
decision
of
that
court
as
to
what
the
substantive
law
of
contract
was,
nor
that
it
should
be
applied
by
the
states.
i
can
only
note
that
the
majority
opinion
in
the
lincoln
mills
case
refers
with
approval
to
judge
wyzanki's
opinion
in
massachusetts
where
that
judge
makes
a
very
clear
and
very
persuasive
distinction
between
substantive
remedial
law
and
substantive
contract
law.
in
any
event,
however,
i
suspect
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
pardon?
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
well,
no
i
think
i
said
the
decision
was
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
thought
i
said
the
decision
of
judge
wyzanski
was
--
was
clear
and
understandable.
and
maybe
this
is
egotism,
i
thought
it
was.
but
i'll
admit
that
the
question
has
a
certain
element
of
what
one
of
the
opinions
referred
to
the
empty
blackness
or
was
it
the
black
emptiness
of
the
section
301.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
but
be
that
as
it
may.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
gather
there
was
in
reading
the
opinion,
mr.
justice
black.
i'm
only
asserting
that
that
case
didn't
--
what
it
did
not
hold,
i'm
reasonably
certain
of
it.
and
what
it
did
not
hold
is
what
everybody
seems
to
have
agreed
three
counts
in
a
row
and
that
is
that
the
state
of
washington
is
bound
to
apply
a
federal
common
law
in
deciding
cases
involving
breaches
of
contract
before
it
if
they
fall
in
this
area.
now,
whether
this
would
be
true
or
not,
however,
it
does
not
have
to
be
decided
by
this
court
in
this
case.
it's
probably
entirely
academic
because
when
it
is
asserted
boldly
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
that
the
state
of
washington
here
applied
state
contract
law,
i
see
no
basis
or
authority
for
that
assertion.
the
washington
state
supreme
court
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
case
cited
no
legal
authority
for
its
determination
that
there
was
a
breach
of
contract.
it
cites
no
scholars
and
no
cases.
i
think
the
court
of
the
state
of
washington
was
rather
outraged
that
it
should
be
contended,
seriously,
that
it
is
not
a
breach
of
contract
to
strike
--
to
require
an
employer
not
to
exercise
the
duties
or
the
rights
which
are
expressly
reserved
to
him.
in
fact,
the
court
makes
this
rather
clear.
i
submit
that
some
fine
construction
of
the
words
of
the
arbitration
provisions
of
the
contract
here
in
question
can
be
and
were
argued
at
all
levels
of
this
case.
but
if
it
is
true
as
counsel
says
that
he
stipulates
that
there
was
a
no-strike
provision
if
the
arbitration
involved
interpretation
of
the
contract,
then
i
must
direct
his
attention
to
page
214
of
the
record
before
this
court
where
the
arbitrators
are
speaking.
and
this
is
what
the
arbitrators
held.
it
will
be
recalled
and
i
quote,
“that
under
the
working
agreement,
the
employer
reserved
the
right
to
discharge
any
man
in
his
employees
if
his
work
is
not
satisfactory.”
the
board
feels
that
a
proper
interpretation
of
that
clause
is
that
the
right
of
discharge
is
preserved
in
the
case
where
the
man's
services
are
not
satisfactory
to
his
employer
but
that
the
right
must
be
invoked
reasonably
and
in
good
faith.
during
oral
argument,
counsel
for
the
parties
virtually
agreed
that
such
should
be
the
interpretation
although
disagreeing
as
to
its
application
under
the
facts
in
the
record.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
i
hope
that
to
point
out
that
in
the
arbitration
in
this
matter,
there
was,
and
that
was
simply
while
sitting
here
and
listening
to
argument,
there
were
many
instances
in
which
the
interpretation
of
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
an
issue
before
the
board
of
arbitrators
and
was
in
fact
decided
by
them.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
no.
they
--
that
question
was
not
presented
to
them,
mr.
justice
black
because
it
was
moot
by
the
time
it
came
to
them.
the
strike
was
over
and
nobody
contemplated
it
would
be
resumed.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
yes,
you're
correct
in
correcting
me,
mr.
justice
black
because
they
did
have
before
them
still
the
rightness
or
wrongness
of
what
occurred
in
may
1958
and
that
they
decided.
that's
what
was
really
before
it
and
it
involved
interpretation
--
argued
interpretation
of
the
contract
and
if
mr.
hoague's
theory
of
what
this
contract
means,
and
that
it
implies
a
no-strike
clause
only
in
one
instance
where
interpretation
is
involved,
then
by
his
own
theory,
he
clearly
has
a
no-strike
clause.
but
obviously,
the
state
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
relied
on
no
such
narrow
ground,
and
i
would
not
desire
too
either,
because
had
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
expressly
followed
such
federal
common
law
as
there
is
in
this
area,
that
is
the
decisions
of
the
various
courts
of
appeal
that
have
dealt
with
this
matter.
it
would
find
that
with
the
exception
of
one
case,
cited
by
counsel
in
his
brief
and
i
believe
in
our
own
with
only
one
exception
every
court
of
appeals
to
which
this
matter
has
been
brought
has
decided
that
under
these
circumstances,
this
conduct
constitutes
a
breach
of
contract.
now,
i
have
cited
this
--
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
pardon?
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
the
strike
to
force
an
employer
to
forego
the
exercise
of
a
right
reserved
to
him
in
the
contract
even
though
there
is
no
expressed
no-strike
clause.
and
those
cases
are
collected
beginning
at
page
13
of
our
brief
and
there's
an
extensive
american
annotated
alr
citation,
a
very
recent
one
on
the
subject,
and
we
submit
that
it
expresses
what
its
common
reason.
and
certainly,
it's
common
law
if
there
is
such
a
thing
in
this
area
as
federal
common
law.
if
we
have
to
decide
that
there
is,
this
is
it.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
yes.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
the
supreme
court
of
washington
says
that
the
opening
part
of
its
opinion
that
it
does
not
view
that
lincoln
mills
case
deprived
it
of
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
issue
before
it.
that
it
only
decided
that,
as
i've
stated
what
i
think
it
held,
and
that
is
that
it
gave
a
substantive
as
well
as
purely
form
creating
influence
to
the
law.
but
it
felt
as
i
feel
that
it
did
not
deprive
the
state
supreme
court
of
authority
to
decide
a
breach
of
contract
case
before
it.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
you
can,
indeed.
mr.
stuart
g.
oles
exclusive
jurisdiction.
