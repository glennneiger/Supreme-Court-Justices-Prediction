justice

whittaker
mr.
hoague,
i
would
like
to
have
you
at
some
time
in
the
argument,
discuss
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
judgment
doesn't
rest
on
two
bases,
(1)
tort
and
particularly,
that
is
the
face
of
the
case
which
for
me
is
troublesome.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
take
your
own
time
and
do
it
in
your
own
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
do
it
in
your
own
way.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
i
understand
you
to
say
mr.
hoague
that
the
--
the
court
would
strike
out
a
plea
to
--
challenging
its
jurisdiction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
it
challenged
the
jurisdiction,
did
you
do
it
--
did
your
court
strike
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then
how
did
you
question
the
power
of
the
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
would
you?
