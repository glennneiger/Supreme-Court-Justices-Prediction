justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
all
went
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
breach
to
justify
the
statute.
if
they
had
discharged
him
although
he
was
a
satisfactory
worker,
would
there
be
a
basis
for
the
strike.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
--
then
you
might
not
successfully
have
been
sued
for
having
breached
the
contract
under
it
would
they
--
or
the
suit
would've
been
on
the
other
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
more
relevance
to
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
what
you're
saying
is
that
--
in
the
--
in
these
circumstances,
as
i
understand
you,
that
rather
than
an
action
in
tort
that
this
strike
raised
the
question
either
of
a
colorably
prohibited
or
protective
right
and
that
in
consequence
the
state
courts
were
ousting
the
jurisdiction
that
the
employer
should
have
gone
to
the
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
that
determined
as
an
unfair
labor
practice,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
did
any
of
those
(voice
overlap)
--
did
any
of
those
cases
involve
what
this
one
does.
they
have
a
contractual
provision
for
arbitration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
i
gather
your
major
point
is
that
there's
no
--
no
strike
clause
in
this
unless
one
is
to
be
implied
by
reason
of
the
arbitration
clause,
isn't
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
--
whether
--
are
any
of
those
cases
which
you've
cited,
cases
in
which
while
there
was
no
no-strike
clause
in
the
contract,
there
was
an
arbitration
clause
in
the
contract.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
of
those
involves
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
despite
the
arbitration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
mr.
hoague
is
that
--
am
i
right
that
the
court
below
didn't
turn
its
decision
that
the
strike
was
a
violation
of
the
contract
upon
the
arbitration
clause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
haven't
--
i
gather
you
argue
that
this
particular
grievance
came
within
the
second
paragraph
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
not
a
matter
--
well,
now
you
say
it's
not
a
question,
but
does
that
conceded
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
we
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the
lower
courts'
interpretation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
agreement
whether
this
particular
grievance
falls
within
the
first
which
has
a
no-strike
provision
or
the
second
paragraph.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
a
(inaudible)
question
about
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
if
they
--
as
you've
just
said,
that
these
were
grievance
falling
within
the
first
paragraph
and
you're
out
despite
that
it's
illegal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
we
going
to
have
to
decide
where
this
grievance
falls
without
any
help
from
the
lower
court
as
to
which
paragraph
that
comes
with
it
on
this
branch
of
the
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
hoague,
may
i
get
back
to
this
case
a
minute?
i
just
want
to
be
clear
about
this.
this
strike
occurred
before
any
arbitration
had
begun.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore,
i
gather
your
concession
goes
to
this,
but
if
this
was
a
grievance,
subject
to
arbitration
under
the
first
paragraph
of
article
xiv,
then
the
strike
having
occurred
before
the
arbitration
even
began,
you
were
guilty
of
a
violation
of
the
provision
no
suspension
of
work
pending
arbitration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
to
the
facts
--
as
to
the
facts,
the
arbitration
began
only
on
a
court
order
eight
days
or
so
after
the
strike
started
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
didn't
go
to
arbitration
by
voluntary
agreements
between
yourself
and
the
company,
but
rather
under
the
compulsion
of
a
court
order
that
you
should
go
to
arbitration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
called
off
the
strike
and
went
to
arbitration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everyone
signed
the
same
agreement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
oles.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask?
was
there
a
reason
why
you
had
a
(inaudible)
tort
rather
than
just
on
breach
of
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
when
was
the
third
amended
complaint
filed,
mr.
oles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
after
–-
after
the
coming
down
of
the
arbitrators
award.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
oles,
i
wonder
if
this
helps
us
on
--
on
the
question
i
asked
you
at
page
4
of
the
record.
it's
the
second
amended
complaint
filed
on
december
9
at
page
8,
paragraph
8
or
recited
the
facts
of
the
arbitration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
prayer
is
for
permanent
injunctive
relief,
and
i
gather
this
is
the
damages
claim,
4781
with
interest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
–-
that
–-
then
it's
–-
so
this
complaint
to
which
the
motion
was
addressed
on
preemption
ground
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
an
argument
going
to
our
jurisdiction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
this
is
not
a
final
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
other
way
around
to
it,
mr.
oles,
we
can
rest
on
breach
of
contract
and
the
arguably
protected
--
prohibited
argument
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
hoague.
you
say
the
first
day
of
trial
was
that
on
march
16,
1959?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
proceedings
that
begin
at
page
19.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
second
complaint
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
i
gather
you
did
answer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
was
not
filed
in
december
1958
and
that
complaint
cited
all
the
facts
of
the
completed
arbitration,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
i
understood
mr.
oles,
his
point
is,
that
then,
it
was
too
late
to
raise
this
question
because
all
of
the
facts
have
been
decided
and
there
wasn't
any
possibility
of
there
being
a
matter
for
the
national
labor
relations
board.
