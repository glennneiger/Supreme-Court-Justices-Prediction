is

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
of
your
brief?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
64?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
where
does
that
placed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
say,
mr.
solicitor,
that
you
filed
the
reports.
i
take
it
by
that
you
mean
to
comply
with
the
request
that
it
may
be
an
argument
about
whether
the
reports
or
request
for
answer
to
question.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
agree
that
that
proposition
of
the
law
was
a
correct
one
that
section
10
does
not
--
if
penalties
do
not
apply
to
a
request
for
answers
to
special
questions
under
6
(b)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
you
may.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
relying
on
the
bowman
case
that
he's
under
no
obligation
to
call
out
the
good
and
the
bad
which
is
upon
you
to
make
them
good
if
you're
going
to
insist
upon
the
penalties
to
default.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
solicitor?
is
there
not
a
difference
in
latitude,
however,
in
the
answering
as
one
over
the
other?
in
the
special
report,
you
follow
the
form
but
you
used
your
own
substance,
but
in
answering
special
questions,
you
answer
the
question
or
your
in
fault,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now,
that
may
be
your
presumption
but
i
find
it
(inaudible)[laughter]
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
when
the
statute
says
there
are
two
statutes,
they
may
have
requested
a
special
report,
would
you
get
up
in
your
own
substance
or
it
may
request
you
to
answer
specific
questions?
now,
if
it
does
that,
it
does
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
by
the
same
thought
and
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
specific
question
as
used
section
6
means
something
different
than
reports
as
used
in
section
10.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
10
is
the
--
10
is
the
penalty
section,
that's
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
you
talked
about
statutes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
--
you
mean
the
facts
of
business
claims
would
cost
(inaudible)
and,
on
the
other
hand,
for
failure
to
answer
certain
specific
questions
that
maybe
privilege.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
you've
started
in
connection
with
the
investigation.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
ask
you
(inaudible)
is
there
any
other
way
the
reports
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
--
or
when
you
--
a
witness,
he
may
decline
to
answer.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
they
stopped
there
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
we
wouldn't
have
this
question.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
is,
he
needs
to
comply
with
any
part
of
the
order
to
(inaudible)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
(inaudible),
that
isn't
to
say
he
didn't
have
to
answer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
the
procedures
on
interrogatories,
commonly
practiced
in
federal
courts,
one
maybe
hold
in
for
failure
to
answer
and
subjected
to
pertinent
sanctions,
but
he
surely
can't
be
made
to
answer
the
whole
batch
if
some
were
bad.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understood
that
here,
the
district
court
held
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
12%
were
bad.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
--
that
was
an
abuse
of
a
legal
right?
