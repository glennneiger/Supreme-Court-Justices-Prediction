mr.
horace
r.
lamb
if
your
honors
please.
this
is
a
review
which
involves
additional
questions
of
administrative
agency
acts,
notably
the
federal
trade
commission.
it
involves
questions
that
arise
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
some
of
which,
i
think,
have
never
previously
been
determined
by
the
court,
and
also,
questions
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act
which
that
the
district
court
below
indicated
were
noble
questions.
the
petition
for
certiorari
raised
or
requested
review
on
six
separate
questions
in
the
court's
order,
however,
granting
review,
which
is
in
the
record
at
page
237.
certiorari
was
allowed
on
march
27,
1961,
limited
to
four
questions
designated
by
the
same
numbers
that
we
had
used
in
our
petition,
namely,
numbers
2,
3,
5
and
6.
now,
i
have
to
point
out,
your
honor,
that
in
the
brief
for
the
united
states,
served
only
a
few
days
ago,
under
which
we
have
replied
by
a
brief
filed
today,
there
has
been
injected
improperly,
we
believe,
an
additional
question.
you
will
recall
that
the
question
on
which
you
will
allow
review,
numbered
5
on
page
237
reads
as
follows,
"our
petitioners
retained
and
filed
copies
of
--
of
confidential
reports
to
the
bureau
of
census
for
the
census
of
manufacture
subject
to
the
investigative
process
of
the
commission.
now,
on
that
very
question,
which
was
presented
to
this
court
in
federal
trade
commission
against
dilger,
decision
from
the
seventh
circuit,
this
court
denied
certiorari.
and
at
that
time,
on
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
then
solicitor
general
did
not
sign
the
petition
but
he
added
at
the
foot
of
the
petition,
his
statement
of
the
difference
of
views
in
the
government
departments
that
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
felt
there
should
be
no
confidential
of
treatment
accorded
these
retained
copies
of
census
reports,
whereas
the
department
of
commerce,
bureau
of
census,
bureau
of
the
budget
are
quite
the
contrary
that
it
would
destroy
the
whole
policy
and
the
purpose
of
reporting
census
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
--
opinion.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
before
the
lunch
and
adjournment,
i
had
referred
to
the
questions
on
which
certiorari
was
allowed
and
referred
to
the
confidential
treatment
of
the
census,
and
i
was
mentioning
the
new
issue,
new
question
which,
for
the
first
time,
had
been
raised
here
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
solicitor
general,
namely,
that
we
had
waived
our
right
to
the
confidential
treatment
of
--
of
the
census
reports.
now,
on
the
main
question,
i
read
from
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
that
he
is
in
accord
with
our
position,
and
i
understand
his
position
to
be
the
same
as
his
predecessor
in
regard
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
dilger
case
to
which
i
had
referred
briefly
before
the
adjournment.
but
on
this
waiver
question,
which
a
large
part
of
the
government's
brief
attempts
to
discuss,
i
think,
i
must,
at
the
outset,
state
that
our
position
is
that
that's
an
improper
additional
question
to
raise
here.
first,
we
say
that
it's
in
violation
of
rule
40,
subparagraph
(1),
small
(d)
(2)
of
the
rules
of
this
court,
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
reply
brief.
and
that
--
under
that
rule,
we
believe
this
court
will
disregard
and
will
not
consider
this
additional
question
of
waiver.
and
we
further
point
out
that
under
all
of
the
appellate
decisions,
it
is
universally
held
that
it's
unfair
to
an
adversary
to
raise
in
the
court
of
last
resort
for
the
first
time,
a
issue
never
previously
raised
in
any
of
these
proceedings.
and
i
think
the
decisions
support
our
position
on
that
point.
but
even
in
fact,
we
say
that
the
solicitor
general
has
overlooked
the
fact
that
during
the
entire
course
of
this
investigation
by
the
federal
trade
commission,
it
has
consistently
been
our
position
that
census
reports
should
be
accorded
confidential
treatment.
it's
his
position
that
because
in
the
informal
proceedings
before
a
representative
of
the
staff
of
the
commission,
we
did
allow
inspection
of
certain
census
reports
of
some
companies.
and
because
in
the
further
proceedings
to
which
i'll
refer
on
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
issued
by
the
--
the
commission,
we
did
produce
certain
copies
of
the
reports,
filed
reports
and
in
fact,
we
had
obtained
photocopies
because
we
couldn't
locate
some
of
the
filed
copies
of
the
reports
of
the
census
of
manufacture.
and
we
refer
to
the
positions
expressly
stated
on
this
point,
long
before
answer,
the
disposition
of
the
solicitor
general
but
only
in
our
answer
did
we
raise
it
for
the
first
time.
but
as
i
point
out
in
the
reply
brief,
we
raised
it
not
only
in
the
answer
but
prior
to
that,
in
a
letter
written
as
long
ago
as
august
18th,
1959
to
the
commission's
secretary,
which
is
quoted
in
part
at
page
6
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner
where
i
made
the
point
that
among
a
number
of
items
in
which
information
was
requested
by
the
commission,
they
were
of
a
confidential
nature
and
in
our
view,
cannot
properly
--
the
commission
cannot
properly
require
that
such
information
be
furnished.
and
i
said
this,
“we
refer
particularly
to
request
for
copies
of
reports
for
the
census
of
manufacture
which
have
been
held
confidential,"
citing
cases.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
that
was
not
before
we
had
given
an
opportunity
to
inspect
certain
reports,
and
i
think
it
was
after
certain
reports
had
been
furnished
under
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
which
is
--
as
i
recall,
it
was
in
the
year
1958.
i
will
review
in
a
moment,
your
honor,
the
chronology
of
these
investigations.
but
i
merely
want
to
deal
with
this
question,
if
i
may,
at
the
outset
but
then,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
it
much
further,
unless
the
court
feels
that
we
should
because
we
think
both
in
law
and
in
fact,
the
solicitor
is
in
error
confessing
that
point
and
that
it
should
not
be
considered
now
at
this
late
date.
i
think
it's
the
general
rule
that
where
there
is
an
effective
waiver,
it's
usually,
of
course,
in
an
adversary
proceeding
and
there
must
be
one
in
intent
on
the
part
of
the
person
waiving
the
privilege
that
he
intends
to
waive
it
or
there
must
be
an
advantage
to
be
gained
by
the
waiver.
now,
neither
of
those
tests,
you
say,
applicable
here.
i
think
it
would
--
i
--
i
should
say
one
further
thing
and
i
think
i,
in
part,
said
it
before
luncheon,
but
on
question
number
5,
i
don't
think
that
we
need
to
argue
that
at
great
length
because
question
number
5,
i
understand
the
commission
agrees
with
our
position
and
he
has
stated
at
page
10
of
his
brief,
the
solicitor
general
is
of
view
that
if
the
court
reaches
the
question,
which,
of
course,
the
--
i
assume
the
court
will
reach
because
it
--
it's
one
of
the
questions
that
said,
“it
would
review
number
5.”
the
statutory
privilege
should
--
should
extend
to
the
retained
copies
of
reports
to
the
census
of
manufacture
but
not
to
the
underlying
data
in
the
company's
books
and
records
upon
which
the
reports
are
based.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
yes,
sir.
the
brief
for
the
united
states,
sir,
page
10
at
the
bottom
of
the
last
paragraph.
the
paragraph
starting,
“instead
of
burdening
the
court
with
briefs,”
the
attempt
to
give
set
forth
the
competing
arguments.
he
goes
to
the
length
of
--
of
setting
forth
a
competing
arguments
but
makes
it
quite
clear,
and
i
hope
i'm
accurate
about
this,
that
this
solicitor
general
has
his
predecessor
agrees
that
they
should
be
accorded
confidential
treatment.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
interesting
to
review
briefly
how
these
questions
come
before
the
court.
this
proceeding
has
had
a
rather
long
history.
my
client,
as
early
as
1951,
exchanged
it
shares
of
its
stock
for
shares,
all
of
the
outstanding
shares,
i
may
say,
of
a
number
of
small
converting
companies
in
the
manufacture
of
converted
products
such
as
boxes,
various
kinds
of
containers
and
other
materials.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
all
paper
products,
your
honor,
all
paper
products.
my
client
is
a
--
what's
called
an
integrated
paper
manufacturer,
that
is
from
the
timber,
fibres
right
straight
through
to
various
grades
of
paper
and
is
a
large
producer
of
craft
paper
and
has
probably
one
of
the
largest
craft
paper
mills,
i
believe,
in
the
world
at
jacksonville,
florida,
erected
in
the
early
1950s.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
it
makes
board,
a
line
of
board
there,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
i
may
amplify
on
that
a
moment,
the
announcement
that
the
st.
regis
paper
company
intended
to
go
into
the
manufacture
of
linerboard
in
a
large
way
at
this
large
plant
announced
in
the
early
1950s.
following
the
scarcity
of
that
commodity,
the
end
of
the
korean
war,
was,
we
believe,
the
direct
stimulus
for
the
inquiries
that
came
initiated
by,
i
may
say,
these
small
mostly
family
hold
--
held
corporations
to
join
st.
regis
by
an
exchange
of
shares
and
thereby
secure
their
converting
operations
as
permanent
supply
of
linerboard.
well,
that
mill
came
into
production
in
--
it
was
announced
in
the
late
--
in
early
1950s.
it's
about
1955,
it
got
into
production.
these
acquisitions,
which
the
commission
inquires
about,
started
with
a
letter
from
the
commission
that
was
issued
under
date
of
september
1956
from
the
first
inquiry
from
the
commission
appears
in
the
record
at
page
88.
i
may
say,
your
honor,
i'm
going
to
review
here
a
number
of
the
exhibits
in
the
district
court
proceedings.
i
could
say
that
--
perhaps,
i
should
say
here
that
the
history
of
the
proceedings
starting
with
this
letter
go
through
long
periods
of
submission
of
great
many
documents,
voluntarily
in
accordance
with
the
commission's
established
policy
and
proceeds
a
year
later
by
the
issuance
on
december
13th,
1957
or
prior
--
prior
to
that
date
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
september
of
1957
of
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
which
appears
in
the
record
specifications
attached
to
it.
it
starts
on
page
109
and
it's
dated
september
16,
1957,
addressed
to
the
secretary
of
the
petitioner
and
to
which
there
are
annexed
specifications
of
the
various
documents
that
are
to
be
produced.
to
return
to
the
letter
of
september
7th
of
record
88
and
89,
i
direct
the
court's
attention
that
on
page
89,
the
request
that
was
made
to
our
client
read
as
follows,
“it
is
therefore
requested
that
you
furnish
this
office
with
full
and
complete
answers
to
each
of
the
questions
set
out
below
and
with
copies
of
specified
documentary
material.”
and
then,
there
follows
a
good
many
questions
to
be
answered
and
documents
to
be
produced.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
yes,
sir,
right
straight
through
at
page
96.
and
i
think,
your
honor,
perhaps
even
extending
further
with
the
attachments
to
that
exhibit
which
give
certain
forms
that
are
to
be
completed.
you'll
note
on
97,
there
are
forms
that
they
require.
and
on
page
100,
they
identify
a
great
deal
of
the
various
kinds
of
products
by
reference
to,
in
the
right
hand
column,
census
product
code.
and
in
below
that
column,
you
will
find
a
whole
series
of
--
rather
a
long
numbers
which
are
the
code
numbers
assigned
by
the
department
of
commerce
to
these
various
commodities.
the
proceedings
in
the
federal
trade
commission
on
its
subpoena
were
concluded
by
a
statement
made
by
the
hearing
attorney
and
mr.
sideman
which
appears
in
our
answer
at
page
64.
and
it
says,
“mr.
sideman”
this
is
under
dated
december
13,
1957,
and
i
quote,
“it's
now
appearing
that
the
exception
of
census
reports
which
will
when
received
be
furnish
by
mail
that
the
witness
has
fully
responded
to
all
specifications
of
the
subpoena
to
the
extent
that
the
papers,
documents
and
records
requested
were
in
his
control,
the
secretary
of
st.
regis
paper
company,
this
hearing
is
terminated.”
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
64,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
no,
that's
64
of
the
record.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
64
of
the
10
covered
transcript
of
record.
that's
it,
sir.
at
page
64,
subparagraph
(d)
in
one
of
the
affirmative
defenses
of
our
answer,
there
is
this
statement
quoted
by
mr.
sideman.
and
it
was
following
that
end
of
the
proceeding
in
december
1957
that
in
the
following
year
of
june,
the
further
letter
of
june
30,
1958,
which
is
mentioned
just
below
the
--
what
i've
quoted,
was
received
from
mr.
stroud,
an
attorney
in
the
federal
trade
commission's
office
in
new
york.
now,
it
would
take
quite
a
long
time
to
go
through
this
entire
record,
and
i'll
endeavor
to
summarize
it,
but
i
think
that
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
my
client
has
furnished
and
did
furnish
in
response
to
this
request
a
very
large
volume
of
documents.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
before
the
hearing
examiner
sideman,
i
think
there
were
213
separately
numbered
exhibits,
and
some
of
those
exhibits
included
quite
a
number
of
documents
on
a
particular
subject.
what
following
the
letter
on
which
raised
questions
that
we
tried
our
level
best,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
to
resolve
by
pointing
out
that
in
response
to
the
original
letter
of
1956
and
in
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
proceedings,
the
commission
already
had
received
and
had
in
its
file
the
answers
to
a
great
many
of
the
questions
that
it
continued
to
ask
of,
that
they
answer
it.
i
think
that
we
have
any
serious
difficulty
with
the
commission.
it
dealt
larger
with
a
request
that
the
commission
made
in
its
letter
asking
that
we
give
the
names
of
the
10
largest
customers
in
various
product
lines.
and
that
raised
very
great
difficulties.
it
was
our
position
that
under
the
rules
of
the
commission,
names
of
customers
are
confidential.
it's
also
an
exceedingly
difficult
matter
to
arrive
for
any
particular
time
and
the
determination
of
who
is
your
customer
that
maybe
included
in
such
a
group.
and
we
proposed
two
things.
first,
let
us
not
give
you
the
actual
names,
let
us
give
you
designation
by
symbols,
and
we
will
give
you
the
figures
from
our
books.
if
you
wish
to
verify
from
our
books,
you
may
come
and
do
so.
but
we
were
reluctant
to
give
them
to
the
commission
unless
we
could
have
assurance
from
the
commission
that
they
would
not
make
further
verification
and
the
belief
that
a
verification
among
customers
would
be
prejudicial
and
we're
really
in
the
nature
of
trade
secrets
and
trade
information.
we
come
finally
to
the
fact
that
apart
from
the
letters
and
the
subpoena
proceedings,
the
commission
itself
began
to
take
a
formal
action,
which
it
did
in
its
resolution
that
was
adopted
in
--
it's
next
to
the
answer
of
january
1959.
that
resolution,
your
honors,
appears
at
page
7
of
the
transcript
as
exhibit
a
to
the
complaint.
and
that's
the
resolution
directing
an
investigation
of
the
acquisition
by
st.
regis
of
the
stock
or
assets
or
both
the
stock
and
assets
of
other
corporations,
reciting
it
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
those
acquisitions
may
be
in
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
it's
in
the
public
interest
to
investigate.
and
they
asserted,
we
believe,
for
the
first
time
that
it's
ever
been
attempted
by
the
commission
that
it
have
authority
under
section
6
(a)
and
(b)
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
to
investigate,
to
determine
whether
one
of
the
antitrust
laws
has
been
violated.
now,
i
appreciate
that
on
that
question,
the
district
court
held
against
us
and
certiorari
was
not
granted,
so
we
accept
here,
as
we
must,
that
it
settled
and
there's
no
use
arguing
on
the
power
of
the
commission.
we
did
undertake
to
respond
to
the
nine
different
letters
which
are
exhibits
beginning
b
on
page
9.
and
i
point
out
that
exhibit
b
is
addressed
to
the
petitioner
and
that
exhibit,
i
believe
it's
j
are
the
two
letters
that
are
addressed
to
the
petitioner.
all
of
the
other
letters
are
addressed
to
others
than
the
petitioner.
exhibit
j
appears
at
page
44.
you'll
note
they
are
entitled
orders
requiring
filing
of
special
report.
but
as
you
read
the
text,
they
are
actually,
in
our
view,
requests
in
large
part
for
answers
and
writing
the
specific
questions.
but
they
are
very
much
like
subpoenas,
and
i
think
there
were
so
treated
by
the
district
court.
now,
a
great
deal
of
the
information
requested
was
furnished.
there
are
some
of
it
that
was
not.
without
going
into
the
details,
we
show
in
a
summary
form
in
the
graphs,
which
the
government
itself
prepared,
annex
to
our
brief
at
--
as
appendix
b,
a
number
of
figures.
and
i
direct
your
attention
particularly
to
appendix
b,
figure
3
which
refers
to
orders
numbered
1
and
7.
this
is
the
annex
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
where
the
circular
graph
shows
the
results
in
the
district
court.
i
come
to
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
just
a
moment.
but
in
short,
the
district
court
found
that
according
to
their
own
estimate,
14%
of
the
total
number
of
questions
were
unenforceable
on
the
ground
that
they
were
vague,
indefinite
and
incapable
of
being
answered.
and
as
to
49%,
while
holding
them
that
they
were
enforceable
but
there
was
no
necessity
for
enforcing
because
we
had
furnished,
in
response
to
the
court's
own
request
in
answer
to
the
government's
comments
of
defaults,
the
place
is
square,
we
had
previously
furnished
a
great
deal
of
the
requested
information,
and
that
applies
to
that
49%.
so
that
part
of
the
pie
which
totals
63%
of
these
requests
were
not
enforced
by
the
district
court.
and
as
to
the
other
37%,
3%
of
them
related
to
the
reports
to
the
census
of
manufactures,
leaving
only
34%
or
approximately
one-third
as
to
which
the
district
court's
order
required
enforcement.
now,
the
district
court's
order,
and
i
say
first,
i
think
i
pointed
out
that
this
case
was
tried
on
stipulated
facts.
and
the
stipulation
appears
in
this
record
at
page
69,
stipulation
of
facts
and
pre-trial
order.
and
there
is
the
resumé
and
the
chronological
development
to
which
i
previously
referred
regarding
the
receipt
of
the
september
19,
1956
letter.
i
might
call
that
i
made
on
september
7th
on
the
bureau
of
investigation
of
the
commission
in
order
to
see
if
we
could
not
present
on
an
informal
basis,
all
of
the
data
that
they
wanted
and
at
which
time,
i
did
exhibit
documents,
the
most
important
of
which
were
copies
of
registrations
statement.
all
of
these
of
exchanges
and
shares,
of
course,
were
subject
to
the
requirement
of
a
formal
registration
statement
and
prospectus
which
contained
a
whole
mind
of
information
regarding
the
lines
of
commerce
on
which
our
client
and
the
propose
to
collect
corporation
were
engaged.
there
is
reference
also
on
page
72,
paragraph
(10)
to
the
inspection
of
certain
reports
of
the
census
of
manufactures.
now,
you
can
see
that
it
goes
on
into
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
documents
that
are
requested.and
--
mr.

the
--
the
last
preference
i
referred
to
was

--
mr.

lamb
--
and
the
stipulation
continues
for
a
great
many
pages
and
includes,
your
honor,
particularly
in
the
exhibits
that
are
in
the
form
of
letters
exchanged
with
the
commission
which
begin
at
the
exhibit
31
on
page
124.
a
series
of
exchange
of
correspondents
which
endeavor
to
point
out
the
burden
of
the
additional
request
made
to
our
client
extend
to
which
we
had
furnished
documents
and
also
related
to
a
motion
to
the
administrative
agency
to
vacate,
to
set
aside
its
orders
requiring
these
reports
or
to
modify
them
so
that
they
would
be
less
onerous
and
could
be
responded
to.
that
went
on
for
sometime
as
you
will
see
from
the
extent
of
the
letters,
extending
clear
through
a
number
of
exhibits
that
go
on
to
--
right
down
to
exhibit
113
on
page
200.
i
call
your
attention,
your
honor,
to
that
letter
particularly.
that
letter
followed
after
the
commission
had
issued
its
notice
of
alleged
default
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
--
the
petitioner
to
answer
questions
and
claiming
forfeitures
at
the
rate
of
$200
a
day.
and
i
had
written
the
commission
under
day
of
august
31,
1959
requesting
a
conference
to
discuss
this
whole
subject
and
raising
with
the
commission
a
question
whether
or
not,
if
we
couldn't
resolve
it
by
conference,
the
commission
would
submit
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
or
similarly
to
be
instituted
by
this
petitioner.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
that
letter,
unfortunately,
is
not
in
terms
set
out
in
the
exhibits
but
it
is
a
letter
of
august
31st,
your
honor,
referred
to
in
the
first
paragraph
on
page
200.
and
the
significant
text
of
that
letter,
i
have
that
113,
the
letter
that
i
wrote
to
commission
did
raise
the
question
that
i
have
just
described.
but
in
this
preparation
of
this
record,
we
didn't
include
every
single
document.
actually,
my
letter
was
exhibit
108.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
it's
a
part
of
the
unprinted
letter
here,
your
honor,
but
it
is
a
part
of
the
record
in
the
district
court.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
but
you
get
--
a
sufficient,
i
think,
of
what
i'm
saying
in
the
third
paragraph
wherein
--
it's
at
page
--
page
200
of
the
record,
exhibit
113,
your
honor,
i
thought
i
made
that
clear,
where
the
answer
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
federal
trade
commission
said
this,
and
i
quote,
“in
the
event
that
such
suit
should
be
filed,
you
are
advised
that
we
would
be
compelled
to
note
the
probable
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
court
upon
the
authority
of
federal
trade
commission
that
grants
clear
furnished
code,”

decided
in
1927.
and
another,
the
federal
trade
commission

circuit
court,

1927,
decision.
and
your
request
for
conference
has
been
noted
and
expressed
the
doubt
whether
it
could
serve
any
useful
purpose
but
proposed
a
certain
date
september
11.
and
as
the
stipulation
further
shows,
i
was
not
able
to
make
that
date
but
ask
if
we
do
it
within
the
next
10
days.
and
during
that
next
10
days,
the
complaint
in
this
action
was
served
in
the
district
court.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
we
never
brought
the
suit.
they
speak
abruptly.
they
beat
us
to
it.
we
were
contemplating
a
suit.
but
on
the
15th
of
september,
it
appears
from
the
complaint,
page
1
of
the
record,
the
united
states
commenced
action
in
the
united
states
district
court.
and
i'd
like
now
to
turn
to
that
complaint
for
a
moment.
note
that
the
complaint
is
in
two
counts.
count
1
is
an
action
by
the
government
for
relief
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
to
compel
the
petitioner
here
to
make
answer
to
the
various
--
the
two
commission
orders,
so-called,
by
letters
dated
january
6,
1959
made
--
and
--
and
the
six
orders
also
issued
on
january
9th,
1959
to
petitioners
and
certain
other
companies.
and
it
anne1xes
to
the
complaint,
not
only
the
resolution
to
which
i've
earlier
referred
but
the
various
so-called
orders.
and
the
relief
asked
for
as
to
count
1,
appears
on
page
6
wherefore
plaintiff
demands
one
that
the
court
issue
a
mandatory
injunction
demanding
defendant,
its
agent,
attorneys
and
assigns
to
file
with
the
federal
trade
commission
all
the
special
reports
required
by
the
commission's
several
orders
dated
january
9,
1959
and
june
8,
1959.
and
on
the
second
count,
demanding
forfeitures
in
the
amount
of
$100
a
day
for
two
alleged
defaults,
our
answer,
it
begins
on
page
7
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
those
are
the
annexes
to
the
complaint.
our
answer
is
to
be
found
on
page
58
where
we
answered
the
affirmance
of
count
1
and
of
count
2
and
set
up
on
page
61
our
affirmative
defenses,
several
in
number.
after
the
case
was
tried
on
stipulated
facts,
to
which
i've
referred,
and
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
is
printed
in
the
record
at
page
204.
the
case
was
assigned
by
the
chief
judge
to
himself,
justice
--
chief
judge
sylvester
ryan.
and
he
tried
the
case
over
several
days.
he
examines
in
detail
all
of
the
various
documents
and
records,
which
i've
rather
heard
or
referred
to,
refers
to
the
orders.
and
you'll
note
at
the
top
of
page
206,
the
court
says,
“this
is
the
first
time
a
section
6
(b)
order
had
ever
been
used
by
the
commission
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
complaint.”
i
think
that's
the
true
statement
but
never
previously,
in
an
effort
to
investigate
whether
section
7,
the
clayton
act,
had
been
violated
as
the
commission
ever
resorted
to
powers
under
section
6
(b)
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
it's
not
directly
a
material
to
our
point,
your
honor,
only
that
i
do
make
the
point
that
having
asked
for
a
mandatory
injunction.
i'm
pointing
out
that
the
court
reached
the
conclusion
that
based
on
the
dicta
of
this
court
in
the
morton
salt
case,
he
believed
there
was
power
and
that
the
orders
were
validly
issued,
as
he
says
at
the
bottom
of
page
207.
but
then,
it
turns
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
orders
and
he
states
that
if
the
commissioner
were
--
on
page
29,
if
the
commissioner
is
going
to
make
use
of
this
section
6
(b),
it
must
realize
at
the
outset
that
the
outmost
care
in
comparing
these
orders
is
necessary.
the
character
of
the
process
itself
requires
certain
limits
to
be
placed
upon
the
kind
of
the
orders
to
protect
those
to
whom
they
are
directed.
and
it
goes
on
and
discusses
statistical
information
that's
requested,
and
then
stated
its
conclusions
that
when
section
6
(b)
is
read
in
conjunction
with
section
9
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
which
is
the
provision
of
the
act
giving
the
commission
right
to
issue
subpoenas,
it
was
designed
as
a
means
of
convenience
to
businessmen
on
the
commission.
and
he
found
that
we
were
justified
because
he
reviews
the
orders
that
he
found
that
we
should
answer
and
those
that
should
not
answer
and
made
his
own
order
pursuant
to
section
6
(c)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
now,
we
say
that
having
made
a
new
order,
and
the
judgment
is
at
page
213,
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
court's
order
completely
superseded
the
commission's
action.
there
had
been
no
default
as
--
no
default
whatsoever
in
compliance
with
the
court's
order.
you
will
note
that
the
court's
order
by
arrangement
between
counsel
was
divided
into
different
parts.
you
read
those
paragraphs,
there
are
certain
sorts
of
documents
that
would
be
supplied
in
30
days
and
certain
parts
in
60
days.
we
promptly
complied
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
30-day
clause
in
the
judgment.
and
to
our
surprise,
on
the
60th
day,
the
government
served
notice
of
appeal.
we
immediately
cross-appealed.
the
government
appealed,
may
i
point
out,
your
honor,
the
only
problem,
the
dismissal
of
count
2
which
was
the
denial
of
the
forfeiture.
the
government
did
not
appeal
from
any
of
the
determinations
holding
the
commission's
orders
substantially
defective.
we
did
appeal
in
our
cross-appeal
to
raise
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
commission.
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
opinion
appears
at
219.
the
court
holds
and
agrees
with
the
court
that
it
had
the
power
to
issue
the
orders
but
to
our
great
surprise,
it
made
a
very
unusual
holding,
and
it
held
that
--
on
page
232,
that
the
investigative
orders,
obliged
by
the
act,
may
not
satisfy
the
statutory
definition
of
an
order,
since
it
may
not
be
a
final
disposition.
however,
the
order
amounts
to
a
sanction
because
of
the
forfeiture.
and
then
says
the
availability
of
this
relief
although
--
also
mitigates
the
dilemma,"
which
our
decision
here
imposed
upon
district
judges.
and
this
is
the
significant
thing,
your
honors.
this,
to
my
mind,
is
the
basic
error
of
the
--
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
this,
and
i
quote,
“although
modification
of
an
agency's
order
under
6
(c)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
the
most
efficient
treatment
of
partially
void
order
--
of
a
partially
void
order,
it
carries
with
it
the
imposition
of
penalties
for
prior
noncompliance.”
now,
we
say,
your
honors,
that
that's
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
section
6
(c)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
carries
its
own
penalty
for
contumacious
failure
to
comply
with
the
court's
order
and
it's
contrary
to
the
clear
intention
of
the
congress
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
6
(c),
which
we
have
quoted
at
page
16
of
our
brief.
and
i
would
briefly
point
out
the
extracts
that
we
quote
from
the
house
report.
it's
this.
“the
section
6
(c)
expressly
recognizes
the
rights
--
the
right
of
parties
subject
to
administrative
subpoenas
to
contest
their
validity
in
the
courts
prior
to
subjection
to
any
form
of
penalty
for
noncompliance
and
in
the
senate
judiciary
committee.”
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
page
16,
sir,
of
our
brief,
petitioner's
brief.
the
senate
committee
said,
“section
6
--
section
(c)
is
designed
to
recognize
that
a
private
party
may
contest
the
validity
of
an
administrative
subpoena
issued
against
him
prior
to
incurring
penalties
for
disobedience
since
otherwise,
parties
may,
in
effect,
be
deprived
of
all
opportunity
to
contest
the
search
and
seizure
involved."
the
haphazard
and
often
unfair
methods
or
visions
of
administrative
subpoenas
were
recognized
in
the
final
report
of
the
attorney
general's
committee,
citing
the
pages.
now,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
--
our
main
point
on
the
forfeiture
clause
is
summed
up
in
our
objection
to
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
disregard
of
that
legislative
history
and
of
the
precise
provisions
of
section
(c)
of
the
act.
we
think,
therefore,
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
reversing
the
district
court
and
that
the
district
court
was
correct
and
that
there
should
be
no
liability
for
forfeiture.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
reply,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
your
honor,
thank
you.
i
don't
intend
to
argue
census
matter.
i
assume
that
the
senior
law
officer
of
the
united
states
government
has
taken
the
position
which
is
in
accord
with
ours
as
i
stated.
now,
i
could
amplify
from
a
business
point
of
view
that
the
confidential
statement
from
a
corporation's
point
of
view
is
exceedingly
important.
in
the
first
place,
these
census
reports
are
merely
testaments.
they're
not
evidence
of
what
was
manufactured,
and
sold,
and
shipped
in
commerce.
the
commerce
department
knows
that.
they're
only
estimates,
but
they
are
helpful
estimates
to
the
government.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you're
told
by
a
forum
which
the
secretary
has
the
power
to
proscribe,
“keep
this
copy
in
your
file,
it
is
confidential,"
that
should
be
respected.
now
your
honor
on
the
broad
question
of
the
attitude
of
the
commission
about
whether
you
can
answer
a
part
of
these
questions
or
and
reject
thoroughly.
let
me
point
out
one
exhibit
in
this
record.
before
the
district
court,
number
109,
a
letter
dated
august
21,
1959
from
the
federal
trade
commission
to
me
in
which
it
was
said,
in
response
to
my
letter
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
it's
not
in
the
transcript,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
it's
a
part
of
the
court
exhibit
1a.
your
letter
of
august
18th
has
been
received,
has
caught
the
attention
of
the
commission.
the
commission
notes
that
you
state
you
are
willing
to
permit
the
representative
of
the
commission
to
examine
those
portions
of
your
client's
files
which
are
not
of
a
confidential
nature
and
readily
available.
as
the
commission
understands
your
offer,
this
would
be
in
lieu
of
filing
the
reports
which
have
been
directed
by
the
commission.
this
would
not
be
satisfactory.
the
commission
needs
the
information
and
documents
in
the
form
directed
by
the
commission's
orders
and
nothing
short
of
this
will
be
satisfactory.
they
therefore
had
no
alternative.
that
was
the
statement
of
the
commission
delivered
to
us
and
you
couldn't
pick
out
parts
that
might
be
answered
in
those
that
we
thought
were
(inaudible),
because
they
don't
add
it
to
it.
let
me
also
throw
your
honors
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
very
question
of
what
is
the
difference
between
a
request
for
an
answer
in
writing
to
a
specific
question
or
report
was
considered
by
our
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
by
an
able
district
judge
woolsey.
in
united
states
against
national
biscuit
co.,
decided
in
1938,
and
there
the
commission
tried
to
make
the
same
argument
that
they
had
asked
for
a
report,
but
judge
woolsey
held,
“would
you
look
at
what
they
ask
for,
these
are
requests
for
answers
in
writing
to
question.”
and
he
so
held
the
government
took
no
appeal.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
yes,
sir.
i
cite
it
at
page
26
of
our
brief,
sir.
there
was
no
appeal.
judge
lumbard
suggest
that
had
he
been
sitting
as
a
district
--
as
a
court
of
appeals
judge,
he
would
have
doubtlessly
disagreed.
judge
lumbard
was
then
not
a
judicial
officer
when
that
was
decided.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
25,
f.supp.
329,
it's
at
page
26,
your
honor
of
our
brief.
now,
i
think
i've
made
it
clear
that
there
was
no
latitude
allowed
us
here
but
i'd
like
also
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
question.
there
is
no
doubt,
your
honor
that
the
same
information
so
far
as
the
call
for
documents
would
have
been
called
for
by
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
and
if
you
will
recall
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
judge
ryan,
he
so
regarded
these,
the
substantial
equivalent
of
a
subpoena.
now,
i
think
the
law
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
administrative
agency
has
no
power
of
its
own
to
attempt
to
enforce
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
it
must
go
to
a
court.
i
hope
your
honor
sincerely
that
on
this
review,
this
court
will
give
consideration
to
a
provision
of
the
law
that
has
not
received
in
my
humble
opinion
adequate
attainment
in
the
appellate
courts
and
that
is
provisions
of
section
6
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
passed
in
1946.
and
that
deals
with
the
power
to
issue
subpoenas,
it
does,
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
now,
there's
a
very
vast
distinction
however
that
if
a
subpoena
is
issued
and
it
disobeyed,
there
is
a
very
limited
liability.
but
punishable
as
the
court,
it
must
be
after
a
court
determination.
the
commission
here
wants
to
arrogate
to
itself
the
power
to
determined
that
it
shall
be
the
final
arbiter
of
usual
paid
penalties
to
this
corporation
for
not
answering
our
particular
questions.
now,
the
extent
of
the
questions,
the
learned
solicitor
general
read
from
his
draft
and
i'm
sure
he
was
innocent
and
didn't
mean
to
attempt
to
point
out
that
these
were
addressed
in
his
appendix
d,
the
st.
regis
paper
company.
he
refers
to
(inaudible)
orders,
only
two
orders
were
directed
to
the
petitioner
here.
the
seven
other
orders
with
other
corporations,
they
were
not
named
defendants
in
the
action,
only
st.
regis
paper
company.
and
only
penalties
and
forfeitures
were
claimed
against
st.
regis
paper
company,
no
one
else.
i'd
submit
to
you
that
our
glass
at
the
end
of
our
brief
deals
and
shows
the
fairer
picture
and
they're
taken
right
from
the
government's
own
total
figures
but
we
deal
only
with
orders
one
and
seven.
and
i
therefore
suggest
that
the
court
not
be
mislead
by
this
extent
of
one
enforceability
which
was
as
shown
on
page
3b
of
our
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
correct
situation.
now,
those
that
were
unenforceable
were
the
determination
of
the
court.
the
court
found
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
order
a
compliance.
they
were
just
as
able
as
was
my
client
to
find
that
information
in
their
own
file.
they
have
copies
of
all
the
data
that
was
available
to
our
client.
it's
expensive
to
a
corporation
to
have
to
make
these
searches
and
file
all
this
information.
and
we
have
it
and
they
shouldn't
be
duplicated.
now,
i
think
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
one
more
fact,
and
that
is
that
in
the
congress
1958,
if
i'm
not
wrong,
1959
as
well
as
1960,
bills
have
been
introduced
entitled
the
premerger
notification
bill.
the
commission
has
supported
those
bills
vigorously.
they
have
not
been
reported
out
and
not
have
enacted
into
law.
they
would
require
a
corporation
to
give
notice
to
the
commission
of
any
proposed
merger
or
acquisition
of
stock
and
you
couldn't
act
for
90
days,
a
few
satisfied
certain
amounts
as
to
the
assets
to
be
acquired
before
competing.
that
would
be
a
very
serious
interference
with
the
exercise
of
a
lawful
right
and
it's
never
been
made
into
law.
now,
at
this
proposal
that
the
commission
asserts
here
and
i
believe
it's
the
first
time
that
it's
ever
been
brought
before
a
district
court,
that
it
may
have
this
answer
--
these
answers
in
writing,
all
of
these
specific
question
under
the
penalty
of
these
forfeitures,
there
won't
be
any
necessity
or
any
premerger
bill
of
the
law.
they'll
have
something
more
better
and
more
powerful.
and
i
say
that
the
policy
that's
behind
this
should
not
be
disregarded.
i
think
your
honor
there's
only
one
more
point
to
make
and
that
is
that
the
district
court
could
not
order
obedience
to
the
commission's
entire
order.
it
could
not
grant
mandamus.
that
was
a
determination
by
the
learned
district
judge.
and
he
had
very
good
reasons
as
he
stated
in
his
opinion
and
the
government
did
not
appeal.
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
the
district
courts
having
applied
all
the
fair
cast
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
have
been
forfeitures,
the
district
court's
determination
should
be
fully
respected.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
yes,
sir?
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
you
know
your
honor
the
--
as
i
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
the
(inaudible)
mandamus
has
been
abolished
by
rules
as
i
understand
it
but
we're
now
allowed
in
equity
reliefs
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
so
that
when
i
use
the
term
mandamus,
i
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
no,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
no,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
no,
sir,
no,
no.
i
--
i
don't
go
that
far.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
said
it
wasn't
granted,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
wasn't
granted.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
oh,
there's
a
jurisdiction,
there's
no
question
about
that.
now,
my
--
my
only
appeal
was,
your
honor,
that
whatever
test
you
apply,
if
they
can't
satisfy
a
district
court
that
they're
entitled
to
mandamus,
that
should
be
persuasive
and
compelling.
that's
what
happened
in
our
case.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
that's
right.
that's
right,
sir.
i
say
it's
--
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
it's
the
only
case
i've
been
able
to
find
where
a
so-called
report
which
had
request
for
answers
in
writing
were
held
to
be
just
exactly
that,
request
or
answers
in
writing
to
specific
questions
and
i
think
the
whole
answer
to
all
the
argument
about
the
legislative
history
your
honor,
simply
sums
up
that
nothing
more
than
congress
said
what
it
meant
in
section
10,
it
did
not
impose
any
forfeiture
or
failures
to
furnish
answers
in
writing
to
specific
questions.
in
--
well,
i
--
well,
your
honor,
i
endeavored
to
give
the
answer
to
that
a
moment
ago
that
the
test
must
be
--
the
ability
to
satisfy
a
district
judge
whether
or
not
the
questions
as
presented
are
capable
of
enforcement
by
a
court
order
of
mandamus
on
the
whole
of
the
questions
that
are
presented.
it's
very
difficult.
i
agree
that
to
draw
a
line
whether
it's
34%
it's
in
our
case
or
some
other
percentage.
but
i
think
that's
the
only
fair
answer
that
you
have
to
leave
it
to
the
district
court.
and
to
the
exercise
of
their
sense
of
fairness
under
all
the
circumstances
which
i'm
confident
as
judge
ryan
did
here.
well,
i
think
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
substance.
i
think
that
the
questions
of
justice
whittaker,
you
can't
designate
something,
this
is
a
special
report
and
then
actually
set
forth
questions.
my
--
my
suggestion
is
that
where
the
commission,
did
file
as
they
did
here,
such
a
number
of
particular
requests
that
--
and
in
answers
to
questions,
some
called
them
questions,
that
is
a
request
for
answers
in
writing
to
a
specific
question.
now,
if
they
want
to
report,
i
think
that
they
could
say,
“furnish
a
report
as
to
your
organization.”
every
business
would
know
what
that
means
and
it
does
give
the
corporation
a
certain
latitude.
well,
you
may
as
justice
--
as
judge
lumbard
pointed
out,
maybe
very
hard
to
draw
a
line.
but
i
think
a
line
can
be
drawn.
the
question
is
whether
or
not,
it
seems
to
me,
the
commission
is
really
trying
to
do
by
request
for
answers
in
writing
to
a
specific
questions,
what
really
ought
to
be
asked
by
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
that
would
certainly
be
one
test.
and
it
seems
to
me
when
you
look
at
the
questions
here,
special
papers,
that's
right,
sir.
when
you
get
down
to
asking
for
reasons
why
you
did
something,
you
may
ask
that.
one
other
questions
for
example,
tell
us
how
you
fit
it
in
the
acquisition
of
these
companies.
judge
ryan
said,
nobody
could
answer
that.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
they
do
in
large
parts,
sir,
copies
of
our
annual
reports
for
example.
they
also
ask
questions
actually
your
honor,
we
have
answered
everything
as
i
said
earlier.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
yes.
but
from
--
from
our
point
of
view,
i
could
say
to
you
your
honor
in
the
utmost
frankness,
we
have
answered
every
requirement
in
the
order
of
the
district
court
saving
and
accepting
only
the
copies
of
reports
to
the
census
of
manufacture.
i
have
done
it
in
order
to
show
that
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
there
is
no
serious
question
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
we
didn't
want
to
delay
the
commission
but
we
didn't
want
to
make
our
appeal
moot
either.
and
i
think
we
have
held
into
the
case,
sufficient
so
that
it
is
not
moot,
and
that
the
real
issues
are
--
i
hope
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
thank
you.
