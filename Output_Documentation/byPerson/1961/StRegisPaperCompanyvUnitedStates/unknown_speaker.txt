i
argue
that
these
are
special
reports.
what
i
meant
to
say,
mr.
justice
whittaker
was
that
as
i
read
the
statute
dealing
with
penalties,
that
the
penalties
are
due
only
if
there
was
a
failure
to
file
an
annual
or
special
report.
and
i
can't
think
of
any
other
way
to
get
the
penalties
unless
this
is
an
annual
or
special
report
within
that
length.

i

glad
to
rely
on
it
but
