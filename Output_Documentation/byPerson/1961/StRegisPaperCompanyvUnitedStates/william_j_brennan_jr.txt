justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
tell
us
how
reports
got
into
special
present
facts
of
the
same
type?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
think
that's
rather
important.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask,
mr.
solicitor?
did
--
did
the
final
result
come
out
of
conference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
only
in
connection
with
matters
under
inquiry,
(inaudible)
i
mean,
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
correctly
understood
you
to
answer
my
brother
harlan
earlier
that
at
least
as
applied
to
this
case,
what
was
asked
for
was
a
special
report
in
the
form
of
answers
to
the
following
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
--
i
suppose
as
to
my
brother
stewart
just
observed,
quoting
it
so
that
it
makes
it
solely
for
the
purpose
of
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
don't
--
you
don't
rely
on
any
of
these
however
as
supporting
the
government's
claim
for
penalty,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
without
regard
as
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
make
it
hard
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
government
to
get
this
information.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
one
thing,
mr.
solicitor?
do
you
suggest
that
--
do
you
like
judge
friendly's
case,
that
is
--
if
he
--
he
has
to
succeed
at
the
trial
and
demonstrating
such
extensive
invalidity
that
there's
no
longer
an
intelligible
requirement.
well,
doesn't
that
get
us
under
this
50%
or
40%
or
87%
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
apply
that
test,
extensive
invalidity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
--
am
i
--
do
i
correctly
understand
here
that
even
as
to
the
--
i'm
looking
at
that
chart
that
mr.
lamb
referred
us
to,
3b
of
his
brief,
enforceability
and
enforcement
granted
as
to
37%,
was
there
some
question
about
whether
the
government
was
entitled
to
have
the
answer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
all
that
were
involved,
would
that
be
a
defense
for
claim
of
penalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
they
in
fact
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
they
had
given
you
the
information.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
as
to
those
was,
was
there
any
debatable
questions
where
they
should
or
shouldn't
be
compliant,
finally
resolved
against
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
were
all
--
they
were
--
most
of
them
challenged.
in
fact,
he
challenged
all
of
them
because
he
said
you
can't
have
any
information
for
the
purposes
of
determining
whether
we're
violating
section
7.
so
they
were
all
challenged.
and
its
merits
would
give
rise
to
a
difference
in
opinion.
i
should
say
just
a
word
about
the
bowman
dairy
case.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
bowman
dairy
case
is
distinguishable
from
this
one
on
several
grounds.
in
the
first
place,
in
the
bowman
dairy
case,
the
government
employee
who've
been
served
with
the
subpoena
was
put
in
a
dilemma
that
i
think
call
for
some
exercise
of
clemency
by
the
court,
he
either
had
to
disobey
the
attorney
general
or
disobey
the
subpoena.
in
the
second
place,
in
the
bowman
dairy
case,
the
government
and
the
individual
served
with
the
subpoena
had
done
everything
they
could
to
challenge
the
subpoena
short
with
non-compliance.
and
in
this
case,
we
say
that
there
was
a
remedy
under
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
that
the
petitioner
did
not
invoke.
third,
in
the
bowman
dairy
case,
the
court
was
dealing
not
with
a
money
penalty,
but
with
an
individual's
liberty.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
--
there's
an
occasion
for
a
more
liberal
role
in
that
connection
that
there
is
in
dealing
simply
with
the
penal
(inaudible).
now,
i
think
there's
one
further
reason
of
we're
not
extending
the
bowman
dairy
case.
the
bowman
dairy
case
cited
no
authority
and
so
far
as
my
researches
go
which
i'm
not
sure
they
are
complete.
the
bowman
dairy
case
is
contra
to
the
whole
tenor
of
authority
in
other
courts
on
a
similar
problem.
and
adding
those
together,
we
think
that's
clearly
sufficient
ground
for
not
extending
the
bowman
dairy
case
to
cover
this
situation.
