mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
very
important
case
involving
the
administration
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
specifically,
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
the
petitioner,
the
st.
regis
paper
company,
is
the
second
largest
manufacture
in
the
country
of
paper
and
paper
products.
during
the
1950s,
st.
regis
began
acquiring
a
number
of
related
companies,
some
apparently
competitors
and
some
vertical
integrations.
the
federal
trade
commission
was
concerned
as
to
whether
this
violated
section
7,
the
due
amendment
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
accordingly,
it
sought
to
acquire
information
about
the
petitioner
and
about
its
place
in
the
industry.
after
a
long
period
of
trying
to
get
the
information
voluntarily,
the
commission
resorted
to
section
6
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
which
appears
on
page
72
of
our
brief."
section
6
provides
that
the
commission
shall
have
power,"
then
i
skipped
down
towards
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
"to
require
by
general
or
special
orders,
corporations
engaged
in
commerce,"
skipping
a
little,
"to
file
with
the
commission
in
such
form
as
the
commission
may
prescribe
annual
or
special
or
both
annual
and
special
reports
or
answers
in
writing
the
specific
questions
furnishing
the
--
to
the
commission
such
information
as
it
may
require
as
the
organization,
business,
conduct,
practices
and
management
in
relation
to
other
corporations".
and
then
the
final
sentence
says
that
the
report
shall
be
filed
within
such
time
as
the
commission
may
prescribe.
the
commission's
orders
directed
to
st.
regis
came
after
a
long
period
of
trying
to
get
this
information
otherwise.
and
i
may
say
that
the
district
judge
pointed
out
that
this
was
the
first
time
the
question
had
arisen
in
the
court
because
this
was
the
first
time
in
more
than
400
cases
that
the
commission
had
not
been
able
to
get
this
information
voluntarily
and
that
those
questions
all
related
to
perspective
section
7
investigations.
the
orders
to
file
the
reports
were
served
on
st.
regis
and
its
subsidiaries,
some
on
june
8th,
1959
and
some
earlier
in
january
8th,
1959.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
--
there
is
indeed.
and
what
i
said
reports,
i
was
referring
--
i
didn't
mean
to
beg
the
question,
i
was
simply
referring
to
the
formal
heading
which
the
commission
put
on.
i
shall
deal
with
that
along
with
the
other
questions.
it
might
be
helpful
to
summarize
the
essential
facts
firstly
and
in
relation
to
the
statute.
there
was
a
motion
to
quash
or
to
modify
the
order
for
the
filing
of
the
special
reports.
that
led
to
some
delay
but
no
report
was
filed,
no
information
to
speak
of
was
filed
after
the
order
for
the
special
report.
and
therefore,
in
--
in
june
18
and
in
july
22nd,
1959,
the
commission
served
the
petitioner
with
the
notice
of
default.
this
is
provided
for,
as
i'll
show
in
a
moment,
in
the
statute.
the
30-day
period
following
the
notice
of
default
went
by
and
the
commission
then
commenced
this
action
which
is
brought
under
sections
9
and
10
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
the
relevant
paragraph
of
section
9
has
to
do
with
the
enforcement
of
the
order
for
the
special
report.
and
you'll
see
that
on
page
73
in
our
brief,
section
9
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
next
to
the
last
paragraph,
provides
that
on
application
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
writs
of
mandamus
commanding
any
person
or
corporation
to
comply
with
the
provisions,
these
referred
to
sections
of
the
code.
the
original
says
the
provisions
of
this
act.
under
section
10,
relevant
portion
of
which
appears
over
on
page
75,
the
commission
included
a
count
seeking
penalties.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
section
10
provides,
“if
any
corporation
required
by
this
act
to
file
any
annual
or
special
report
shall
fail
to
do
so
within
the
time
fixed
by
the
commission
and
after
notice
of
default,"
and
so
forth,
"if
then
fails
to
comply,
the
corporation
shall
forfeit
to
the
united
states,
the
sum
of
$100
for
each
and
everyday
of
the
continuance
of
such
failure.”
now,
as
the
case
comes
here,
it
falls
into
two
parts
which
correspond
to
the
sections
of
section
9
and
section
10
that
i've
just
read.
one
part
relates
to
the
question
whether
the
commission
shall
be
ordered
to
comply
--
excuse
me,
the
corporation
shall
be
ordered
to
comply
with
certain
portions
of
the
special
report.
and
this
relates,
as
the
issue
has
now
been
known,
solely
to
the
question
of
certain
retained
copies
of
the
census
reports.
the
other
part
of
the
case
relates
to
our
right
to
recover
the
penalties
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
order
for
the
special
report.
now,
i
would
like
to
deal
first
with
the
question
of
the
penalties
and
then
to
come
second
with
the
legal
questions
surrounding
the
retained
copies
of
the
census
reports.
with
respect
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
on
the
question
of
penalties,
there
are
three
questions,
which
the
petitioner
presents,
as
i
understand.
first,
as
justice
whittaker
suggested
a
moment
ago,
the
petitioner
says
that
this
was
not
an
order
for
a
special
report.
it
was
an
order
to
answer
questions
and
that
there
is
no
penalty
for
failure
to
answer
questions.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
--
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
let
me
--
if
i
might
hold
it
just
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
for
a
minute
until
i
state
the
other
issues
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
then
i'm
going
to
deal
with
it
next.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
second
question
that
the
petitioner
presents
in
relation
to
the
penalties
is
that
he
says
that
the
statute,
because
it
provides
penalties
of
$100
a
day,
is
unconstitutional.
and
therefore,
we're
not
entitled
to
the
penalty.
and
the
third
question
that
he
raises
in
relation
to
the
penalties
is
that
he
says
there
were
certain
portions
of
the
order
which
weren't
entitled
to
have
answer,
as
the
district
court
held
in
its
writ
of
mandamus
conceive.
and
therefore,
he
wasn't
obliged
to
file
any
part
of
the
report.
and
we
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
his
argument
and
i
hope,
in
the
course
of
mine,
to
distinguish
the
bowman
case.
but
those
are
the
three
questions,
and
i'd
like
to
take
them
up,
if
i
may,
in
the
order
in
which
i
stated
them.
to
be
a
little
more
precise
about
his
argument
with
respect
to
the
question,
it's
helpful,
i
think,
to
refer
back
to
the
exact
language
of
section
6
and
then
of
section
10.
section
6
speaks
of
an
order
to
file
with
the
commission
in
such
form
as
the
commission
may
prescribe
annual
or
special
or
both
annual
and
special
reports
or
answers
in
writing
the
specific
questions
furnishing
such
information
as
the
commission
may
require
about
certain
things.
as
i
understand
mr.
lamb's
argument,
it
is
that
the
words
"special
reports
and
answers
in
writing
to
specific
questions"
are
mutually
exclusive,
that
answers
in
writing
to
specific
question
cannot
be
comprehended
within
the
term
"special
reports".
and
then
he
says,
if
you
turn
over
to
section
10
dealing
with
penalties,
that
it
prescribes
a
penalty
only
for
a
failure
to
file
an
annual
or
special
report.
now,
we
simply
disagree
with
it.
we
think
that
the
words
"annual"
or
"special
report"
or
"answers
in
questions
to
writing"
are
not
mutually
exclusive.
and
we
think
that
the
word
"annual"
or
"special
reports",
as
used
in
section
10,
covers
a
failure
to
answer
questions.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that's
true.
it
--
this
would
depend,
of
course,
on
the
specificity
of
the
report.
for
example,
i
take
it
that
it
is
perfectly
plain
here
that
if
the
word
"answers
to
specific
questions"
were
not
included
that
no
one
would
suggest
that
this
was
not
a
report
which
the
commission
had
it
ordered,
merely,
because
he
told
them
to
answer
certain
things.
many
of
the
reports,
i
would
guess,
most
of
the
reports
we
file
in
life
do
answer
various
kinds
of
specific
questions.
the
notion
that
because
you
can't
read
loud
of
it,
it's
not
a
report,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
unsound
and
would
defeat
the
very
purpose
of
the
statute.
now,
i
--
based
on
the
position
that
i've
just
stated
upon
the
internal
evidence
in
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
and
with
deference,
justice
whittaker,
on
what
seems
to
me
the
policy
and
common
sense
of
the
matter.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
words
in
section
6
were
not
used
with
such
precision,
as
i
think
i
can
show
in
a
moment.
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
at
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
was
--
i
can't
answer
because
i
don't
think
the
words
in
section
6
were
used
with
great
precision.
and
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
they
were
--
i
think
there
was
evidence
that
they
were
plainly
used
in
the
latter
section
with
this
--
i
--
to
covering
everything
in
the
form.
now
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
let
me
produce
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
evidence,
your
honor,
before
you
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
that
is
what
it
did.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
exactly
what
it
did.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
let's
look
--
let
--
mr.
archibald
cox
your
honor,
let
me
call
attention
to
the
language
of
the
various
bills
that
were
incorporated
into
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
then
i
think
that
it
will
become
apparent
that
the
congress
was
not
focusing
on
annual
or
special
report
as
if
this
was
some
exact
thing,
a
word
of
art
with
the
precise
content.
the
--
both
bills,
i
thought
the
house
and
senate
bills
contained
provisions
relating
to
the
furnishing
of
information.
the
house
bill,
which
is
--
the
report
is
cited
in
our
brief,
contained
provisions
requiring
every
corporation
of
a
certain
size
to
submit
annual
reports,
then
the
commission
might
require
annual
reports
from
others,
and
it
provided
these
corporations
shall
furnish
to
the
commission
such
information,
statements
and
records
of
its
organization,
bondholders
and
stockholders
and
financial
condition
and
also
such
information,
statements
and
records
of
its
relation
to
other
corporation
and
its
business
and
practices
while
engaged
in
commerce
as
the
commission
shall
require.
now,
you
will
note
in
stating
that
the
information
to
be
required,
the
word
“report”
wasn't
used
at
all.
it
said,
"it
should
furnish
certain
information
relating
to
certain
subject
as
the
commission
shall
require
it.
then
the
statute
went
on
and
to
enable
it
--
"that
the
better
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
this
act,
the
commission
may
prescribe
as
near
as
may
be
a
uniform
system
of
annual
report."
the
said
annual
report
shall
contain
all
the
required
information.
now,
i
think
the
word
“report”
was
simply
used,
as
this
shows
the
way
it
runs
along,
to
sum
up
any
information
that
the
commission
might
require.
and
certainly,
in
requiring
information,
you
could
require
information
in
answer
to
specific
question.
then
the
last
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
it
was
in
the
relation
dealing
with
the
bureau
of
--
the
earlier
statutes
dealing
with
the
bureau
of
corporation.
and
then
it
went
on,
the
last
sentence
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
perhaps
my
--
perhaps
my
recollection
is
at
fault.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
sufficiently
informed
to
make
a
categorical
statement.
the
point
i
was
seeking,
and
i
might
not
read
the
last
sentence,
"the
commission
may
also
require
such
special
reports
as
it
may
be
inadvisable."
now,
as
i
see
it,
in
the
passage
i
read,
the
really
enacting
part,
laying
the
duty
on
the
corporation
set
forth
the
kind
of
information
the
commission
might
require
but
without
referring
to
reports,
then
as
a
convenient
shorthand,
referred
to
annual
and
special
report
in
the
latter
part
and
showing
that
those
words,
if
i
may
say
so,
were
not
intended
to
be
words
of
art,
they
were
intended
to
incorporate
in
shorthand
form
what
it
preceded.
now,
this
evidence
is
also
very
clear
in
the
senate
bill.
in
fact,
it
becomes
even
clearer
in
the
senate
bill.
and
this
--
the
senate
bill
in
the
subsequent
history
explains
the
reason,
i
may
have
seem
somewhat
uncertain
or
evasive
in
answer
to
justice
frankfurter's
question
about
whether
reports
meant
just
the
same
thing
in
section
6
and
section
10.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
yes.
now,
in
the
senate
bill
which
came
after
the
house
bill,
the
senate
amended
the
house
bill.
the
powers
of
the
commission
were
dealt
within
section
3.
section
3
gave
the
commission
power
among
other
things
to
investigate
from
time
to
time
and
as
often
as
the
commission
may
deem
advisable,
the
organization
business,
financial
condition,
conduct
and
so
forth,
of
the
corporation
as
the
same
general
recital
of
the
kinds
of
information,
again
without
using
the
word
“report”.
section
6
of
that
bill
which
became
in
almost
the
very
same
words,
section
10
which
is
the
critical
penalty
section
of
this
case
said
that,
"if
any
corporation
subject
to
this
act
shall
fail
to
file
any
annual
or
special
reports
as
provided
in
subdivision
(b)
of
section
3."
that's
the
very
one
i
read
a
moment
ago.
and
in
subdivision
(b)
of
section
3,
the
word
“report”
is
not
used.
now,
it's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
that
was
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
section
6
but
that's
the
penalty
section.
that
--
that's
my
point,
your
honor
mr.
archibald
cox
section
3
didn't
speak
of
report.
mr.
archibald
cox
section
3
said
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
these
are
in
the
bill.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
sections
had
been
renumbered.
mr.
archibald
cox
6
is
now
section
10
with
no
material
change.
i
--
i
don't
think
i'm
arguing
what
i
said.
i
think
that's
a
fact
that
there's
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yet,
section
6
which
became
section
10
refers
to
this
3
(b)
speaking
of
reports
and
imposes
the
penalty
for
failure
to
file
a
report.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
3
(b)
said
--
mr.
archibald
cox
“the
commission
shall
empower
among
others
to
require
any
corporation
subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
act,"
which
the
commission
may
designate
and
so
forth,
"to
furnish
to
the
commission
from
time
to
time
information,
statements
and
records
concerning
its
organization,
business,
financial
condition,
conduct,
practices,
management
in
relation
to
other
corporations.”
those
recitals
are
just
about
the
recitals
that
appear
in
the
present
section
6
after
the
words
"reports,
or
questions
and
rights".
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
this
--
i'm
afraid
there
are
some
guesswork
in
there.
i
should
tell
you
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
one
thing
more.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
well,
i
should
tell
you
one
thing
more
which
may
throw
light
on
that,
mr.
justice,
because
i
haven't
fully
explained
the
senate
bill.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
that
phrase
was
not
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
either
the
house
or
the
senate
bill.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
have
either.
i
referred
to
section
3
(b)
of
the
senate
bill
and
to
section
6
which
punished
failures
to
comply
with
section
3
(b).
now,
section
3
(c)
also
seems
to
be
relevant.
i
think
it's
obviously
very
relevant.
i
didn't
mean
to
play
it
down.
section
3
(c)
gave
the
commission
power
to
prescribe
as
near
as
may
be
a
uniform
system
of
annual
reports
from
such
corporations
or
classes
of
corporations
subject
to
provision
of
this
act
or
to
require
a
special
report
and
so
forth.
now,
the
difference,
as
i
see
it,
between
the
--
well,
there
are
two
ways
you
can
explain
section
6
of
the
senate
bill.
one
could
say,
i
think
that
"oh,
well,
the
reference
to
3
(b)
must
be
a
misprint,
it
meant
3
(c)."
that
is
certainly
possible.
on
the
other
hand,
it
said
3
(b).
the
other
explanation
would
be
the
one
that
i
suggested
in
connection
with
the
house
bill.
you'll
note
that
the
senate
bill
if
you
read
(b)
and
(c)
together
refers
to
the
subjects
on
which
the
commission
may
require
information.
and
then
in
a
sort
of
procedural
way,
it
says
the
commission
may
say
you
do
this
annually
or
may
say
you
do
it
specially,
and
again,
used
the
word
"report"
to
cover
all
the
information
you
might
ask
upon
the
specific
subject.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
how
the
word
answers
the
questions
got
in,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
have
not
been
able
to
discover.
the
only
other
place
that
i
know
that
this
word
appears
is
in
one
of
the
sections
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
suppose
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
final
result
came
out
of
conference.
what
happened
was
that
section
6,
as
it
now
stands,
came
out
of
conference.
i
could
find
no
explanation
that
was
worth
anything.
what
was
--
what
very
little
it
said
is
that
there
was
simply
verbal
changes
and
that
the
notion
of
required
annual
reports
have
been
drawn,
but
there's
no
specific
comment
on
this.
then
the
conferees
simply
carried
forward
what
had
been
6
into
10
without
making
any
change.
now,
the
inference
i
withdraw
is
that
when
they
--
they
had
used
6
to
cover
everything
that
you
might
have
to
report
and
when
they
--
they
simply
carried
it
forward
or
forgetting,
i
expect,
the
fact
that
the
word
“or
questions”
had
been
put
in
section
6.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
report
against
this
background
are
clearly
maybe
something
including
answers
to
specific
questions.
the
real
thing
is
information
relating
to
certain
subjects
whether
it's
a
report
or
questions
as
long
it's
information
relating
to
this
subject,
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
the
(inaudible)
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
that
the
--
in
terms
of
fairness
or
that
the
greater
fairness
was
in
the
failure
--
was
in
punishing
the
man
who
was
told
exactly
what
you
wanted
him
to
do
and
then
he
fails
to
do
it.
whereas
if
you
simply
say,
“go
make
me
a
report”,
it
subjects
him
to
all
kinds
of
uncertainty
as
to
what
he
is
suppose
to
give.
the
questions,
get
over
all
the
requirements
of
vagueness
as
to
what
they
commanded.
second,
it
would
seem
to
me,
that
the
interpretation
that
we
advocate
are
--
is
far
more
likely
to
make
this
an
effective
instrument
in
carrying
out
the
policies
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
mr.
lamb
says
that,
well,
for
a
report,
you
don't
really
have
to
give
them
what
they
want,
that
a
report
leaves
you
quite
a
lot
of
latitude
to
move
around
it.
i,
and
this
of
course,
means
in
effect
that
a
company
that
doesn't
want
to
give
the
commission
information
is
able
to
move
around.
whereas
if
the
commission
can't
ask
specific
questions,
then
it
is
in
a
position,
better
position,
to
get
the
information
that
congress
wanted
it
to
have.
mr.
archibald
cox
some
--
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
with
--
with
one
exception,
i
think.
i
would
agree
with
judge
lumbard
in
the
court
below,
that
that
maybe
that
there
are
some
questions
that
might
be
asked
which
were
so
specific
and
covered
so
small
a
subject
that
they
could
not
be
regarded
as
reports.
but
i
would
take
there
was
a
very
substantial
overlap
between
the
two
and
with
that
possible
exception
then
i
would
think
that
your
honor
said
--
mr.
archibald
cox
with
the
exception
that
i
noted
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that's
what
it
would
come
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
i
think
your
honor
that
you
would
have
equally
nice
questions
if
you
were
to
say
that
in
order
for
a
report
can't
specify
in
detail
what
the
information
to
be
given
is
and
that
would
be
the
effect
to
of
saying
that
anything
that
asked
questions
can't
be
a
report.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
whether
--
mr.
archibald
cox
or
especially
you
filed
a
report
--
or
especially
you
filed
a
report.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
it
would
be
and
would
have
to
be.
that
was
the
difficulty
with
the
petitioner's
interpretation.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'd
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'd
--
i
would
have
to
agree
of
course,
that
that
is
troublesome.
on
the
other
hand,
i've
observed
words
put
in
the
statutes
which
clearly
got
there
redundantly
or
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution.
i
would
--
here,
i
presume,
that
someone
said
when
they
were
writing
section
6,
well,
you
better
put
in
our
answers
to
questions.
somebody
may
think
that
a
report
does
cover
an
answer
to
a
question
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
which
is
a
gesture
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
but
they
would
be
comparatively
few.
it's
not
done
on
a
large
scale.
i
believe
it's
very
few.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'll
--
i'll
try
to
get
the
answer
and
then
maybe
they'll
write
it
for
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i'll
enlighten
you
specifically
later.
it's
not
done
in
the
way
it
is
with
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
carriers
or
the
fcc
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
anything
like
that.
there
maybe
some
special
categories
but
i
know
there
are
no
pecuniary
reports.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
was
done
in
connection
with
a
formal
investigation.
the
initial
efforts
to
get
information
had
been
informal
but
then
before
this
order
was
entered,
they
had
formally
instituted
an
investigation
against
st.
regis.
there
is
one
other
or
two
points
i
would
like
to
emphasize
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there's
none
that
i
have
thought
of.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
to
get
a
penalty,
we
would
have
to
show
that
this
was
within
the
word
report
as
used
in
the
section
10
because
that's
what
the
penalty
is
--
is
for.
now,
there
were
two
points
i
wanted
to
emphasize.
one
is
that
so
far
as
anything
that
the
commission
might
do
could
make
it
clear.
the
commission
did
everything
possible
to
make
it
claim
that
this
was
in
its
judgment
a
special
report.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes.
it's
on
page
9
of
the
record.
the
--
they
all
followed
the
same
form.
it
was
entitled,
“order
requiring
filing
of
special
report”.
and
then
in
the
first
paragraph,
it
said,
“you
are
required
to
submit
a
special
report
to
the
commission
within
30
days
containing
the
information
and
documents
specified
in
the
following
question.”
so
the
questions
were
simply
a
way
of
specifying
what
the
report
should
cover.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
no.
but
to
the
extent
that
what
the
commission
labeled
it
might
be
important
and
so
far
as
any
question
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
was
mislead
is
concerned
and
to
--
on
those
points,
i
think
it
is
important
thus
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there
are
some
advantages
in
administrative
practice
to
the
commission.
in
filing
an
order
for
a
report,
it
--
if
you
use
the
subpoena
process,
then
of
course
you
may
only
subpoena
documents
that
already
exist.
and
if
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
think
that
would
--
that
would
--
if
my
memory
is
right
that
would
have
to
await
the
beginning
of
an
adversary
proceeding,
whereas
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
determine
whether
an
adversary
proceeding
should
be
done.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
understand.
i
was
mistaken
on
that.
there's
one
bit
of
internal
evidence
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
no.
oh,
i
--
i've
--
i
meant
to
insist
throughout
that
this
was
a
special
report.
now,
there's
one
other
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
whatever
they
hand
maybe.
and
i
think
that
the
key
to
that
is
the
kinds
of
information
that
the
commission
is
authorize
to
obtain.
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
before
i
pass
on
to
one
other
provision
in
section
10
which
is
headed
in
offenses
and
--
or
penalty.
the
paragraph
above
the
one
relating
to
the
penalties
for
failure
to
file
a
special
report
deals
with
another
--
other
--
a
number
of
other
offenses.
it
reads,
"any
person
who
shall
willfully
make
or
cause
to
be
made
any
false
entry
or
statement
of
fact
in
any
report
required
to
be
made
under
this
act",
and
then
goes
on
and
impose
the
penalty.
now
unless
the
word
report
as
used
in
section
10
covers
answers
to
questions
at
least
in
circumstances
substantially
like
this,
that
would
mean,
there's
no
penalty
for
giving
a
false
answer
to
questions
at
all.
because
you
cannot
find
any
other
penalty
in
the
act
that
covers
any
other
provision
of
the
act
that
covers
false
answers
to
question.
and
again
this
suggest
to
me
when
you
see
in
section
10
that
they've
tried
to
impose
penalties
for
every
kind
of
violation
that
the
word
report
was
used
inclusively
to
cover
all
of
these
things
and
that
there
had
been
no
thought
in
adding
the
words
in
answers
to
questions
in
writing,
that
they
were
something
separate
and
distinct.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
take
it
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
if
one
goes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
but
i
think
if
you
go
back,
mr.
justice,
to
the
--
to
the
earlier
language
of
the
bill
that
annual
was
meant
to
be
something
that
you
were
required
to
do
periodically
once
a
year
and
that
special
simply
covered
what
you
are
required
to
do
any
other
time.
and
that
would
cover
all
the
furnishings
of
information
that
i
could
think
of.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that's
true,
certainly.
i
would
like
now,
if
i
might,
to
deal
very
briefly
with
the
two
other
objections
that
petitioner
raises
to
our
claim
with
the
penalties
and
then
to
spend
the
remainder
on
--
of
my
time
on
the
very
difficult
question
of
the
retained
copies
of
the
senate
report.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i'll
be
--
i'll
be
guided
by
the
court.
these
--
there
are
difficult
questions
here
to,
i
think.
petitioner's
second
argument
is
that
section
6
and
10
taken
together,
the
penalty
section,
are
unconstitutional
because
a
--
an
accruing
penalty
of
$100
a
day
is
imposed
without
any
explicit
provision
for
prior
judicial
review.
our
answer
to
that
is
that
we
think
that
if
the
penalties
are
heavy,
so
burdensome,
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
require
the
petitioner
to
wait
and
take
his
chance
in
the
action
to
recover
the
penalties
if
they
are
that
burdensome.
then
he
has
the
right
under
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
seek
review
of
the
commission's
order
without
waiting.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
penalties
are
not
burdensome
enough
to
justify
equitable
intervention,
then
we
think
a
fortiori,
they're
not
unconstitutional.
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
clark
steamship
case,
judge
augustus
hand
held
in
the
second
circuit
that
penalties
of
$500
a
day
were
not
so
heavy
as
to
be
unconstitutional
that
this
was
a
question
on
which
a
corporation
that
chose
to
disobey
an
order
might
be
required
to
take
its
chance.
our
view
here
is
that
there
is
relief
available
under
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
say
again
two
things
about
the
claire
furnace
case.
first,
claire
furnace
case
precedes
the
enactment
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
that
therefore
assuming
it
to
have
been
proper
then,
the
administrative
procedure
act
has
changed
the
law
in
that.
second,
i
would
point
out
that
the
claire
furnace
case,
in
addition
to
being
one
which
had
given
the
court
very
obvious
trouble
in
view
of
having
been
argued
twice,
a
long
time
it
was
on
the
docket.
that's
--
a
suit
there
was
brought
against
the
federal
trade
commission
whereas
the
action
for
penalties
could
be
brought
only
by
the
attorney
general.
and
the
case
therefore
it
seems
to
me
only
to
hold
that
the
action
could
not
be
brought
against
federal
trade
commission,
not
that
no
action
for
relief
in
equity
would
lie.
and
i'm
confirmed
in
justice
stewart,
by
the
fact
that
chief
justice
hughes
in
a
case
not
cited
in
our
brief,
california
against
latimer,
california
v.
latimer
-
305
u.s.
255,
i
don't
know
whether
to
say
--
explain
or
strongly
hinted
that
the
claire
furnace
case
should
be
put
on
this
ground.
in
any
event,
he
clearly
indicated
that
that
was
the
ground
on
which
he
thought
it
would
be
read.
now,
with
the
problem
here
about
which
party
you
name
would
have
been
cured
by
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
we
think
that
the
action
could
have
been
brought
under
that
section.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
the
federal
trade
--
the
federal
trade
commission
did
say
that,
and
i
guess
that's
just
one
of
the
burdens
i
have
to
carry.
i
--
i
ought
to
point
out
however
that
when
the
federal
trade
commission
said
that,
it
was
only
10
days
before
this
action
for
the
penalties
had
been
brought.
it
was
after
there
had
not
only
been
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
order.
it
was
after
the
notice
of
default
and
was
right
on
the
very
suit.
furthermore,
when
the
action
for
the
penalties
had
been
filed
at
that
time
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
have
been
appropriate
for
the
petitioner,
he
was
entitled
to
that
relief,
to
go
in
an
ask
for
a
stay
of
the
order.
the
case
was
already
in
court.
and
this
of
course
is
a
request
that
they
finally
made
when
it
got
to
this
court
and
which
this
court
granted
in
its
answer
--
in
its
order
on
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
other
argument
that
petitioner
makes
with
respect
to
the
penalties
is
that
since
certain
portions
of
the
required
--
since
certain
portions
of
the
order
for
the
required
report
sought
information
to
which
the
commission
was
not
entitled.
therefore,
it
didn't
--
the
petitioner
didn't
need
to
comply
with
any
part
of
the
report.
i
think
on
that,
it's
worth
calling
attention
very
briefly
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
logically
included.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
well,
if
some
were
bad,
he
can't
be
required
to
answer
the
whole
batch.
and
i
take
it
that
--
i
guess
i
didn't
grasp
your
point.
i
take
it,
if
they
had
answered
the
parts
that
were
clearly
proper
and
it
said
as
to
the
others
that
they
contended
that
they
were
improper
and
then
we
had
sued
for
the
penalties,
we
would
lose.
but
they
didn't
answer
any.
it
would
be
as
if
the
litigant
didn't
answer
any
of
the
interrogatories.
mr.
archibald
cox
here,
there
were
--
here,
there
was
no
appeal
taken
so
that
that's
what
it
amounted
to.
here
12%
were
held
to
be
bad.
that
means
there
were
88%
that
were
good
and
that
petitioner
didn't
answer
any
of
them
directly.
he
did
at
the
time
of
the
trial
point
out
that
he
had
somewhere
in
the
material
he
had
earlier
given
the
commission
the
answers
could
be
found.
and
that
covered
a
substantial
part.
but
88%
or
83%
or
84%
depending
on
the
census
question
were
good.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
think
the
test
was
properly
stated
by
circuit
judge
friendly.
the
question
is
whether
the
bad
part
is
--
he
said
such
extensive
invalidity,
there
is
no
longer
an
intelligible
requirement
for
an
annual
or
special
report.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
know
the
one
you
referred
to
but
not
the
name
to.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
have
to
file
in
time
of
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
you
have
to
say,
you
had
to
file
and
claim
the
privilege.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
and
here
we
would
say
that
he
had
to
file
as
to
the
good
part
and
as
to
the
rest,
he
could
have
said
that
it
was
bad.
furthermore,
remember
that
under
the
suggestion
in
the
morton
salt
case
in
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
he
could
have
gone
into
court
and
get
relief.
i
would
also
like
to
emphasize
one
thing
which
i
passed
over
because
of
the
shortage
of
time.
the
commission
had
been
trying
to
get
information
out
of
the
petitioner
since
september,
1956.
and
everytime,
there
was
some
objection
in
the
conference
to
be
held,
and
there
are
more
objections,
they
did
get
finally
by
subpoena
substantial
amounts
of
information.
but
--
then
when
they
came
to
try
to
bring
the
information
up
to
date
and
to
get
information
pertaining
to
the
new
acquisition,
then
they
had
to
go
through
this
all
over
again.
as
judge
lumbard
said,
“this
is
a
case
of
a
company
which
made
an
innocent
mistake
or
omitted
something
in
good
faith.”
this
had
been
tussle
to
get
information
all
along
and/or
during
that
time,
the
petitioner
had
been
buying
up
more
corporations
in
the
paper
and
paper
products
industry.
so
that
i
think
judge
lumbard's
description
is
direct.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
there
was
any
abuse
of
legal
right
but
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
there
wasn't
any
cooperation
and
that
there
was
an
effort
to
delay.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
suppose
penalties
are
due
under
the
statute
whether
these
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
this
isn't
discretionary.
the
statute
says
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
at
some
point,
there
would
be
a
question
of
degree
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
inevitably.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
one
would
--
i
think
one
would
be
concerned
with
how
many
questions
there
were.
how
much
the
information
in
the
--
how
many
questions
were
bad.
how
much
the
information
was
wrapped
up
together
into
one
bundle
or
how
severable
the
unanswerable
questions
were?
i
thought
answerable
was
the
wrong
word,
questions
that
were
improper
questions.
i
--
i
would
think
those
were
the
two
major
considerations.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
there
were
--
there
were
--
well,
there
was
--
one,
there
was
--
there
were
the
--
taking
our
chart
which
covers
all
nine
orders
instead
of
just
orders
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
one
and
seven,
at
the
back
of
our
brief.
those
--
the
chart
you
had
related
only
two
orders.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
real
difference
but
this
covers
all
nine.
starting
at
12
o'clock,
the
court
denied
enforcement
of
12%
as
too
broad.
amongst
those
related
questions
of
this
kind
explained
how
the
assets
acquired
from
one
of
the
companies
you've
bought
up
are
to
be
merged
into
the
affairs
of
st.
regis
paper
company.
that
there
were
a
number
of
those
rebating
the
different
corporations
and
that
was
most
of
what
the
district
court
held
improper.
then
they
had
complied
with
15%
before
a
default
in
terms
of
answering
those
specifically.
then
there
was
a
rather
large
category
running
from
three
o'clock
to
seven
o'clock
where
st.
regis
as
to
the
trial
or
at
or
after
the
trial
filed
papers
saying,
“you've
already
got
this.
if
you'll
look
at
the
prospective
we
gave
you
in
answer
to
the
subpoena,"
i'm
not
using
an
actual
illustration
to
this
kind
of
thing.
"if
you'll
look
at
the
answers
we
gave
you
and
answer
to
the
subpoena
two
years
ago,
you
will
find
that
you
already
have
this.”
but
they
hadn't
given
even
that
kind
of
answer
as
to
these
two
shaded
parts.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
think
clearly
not.
that
was
all
that
was
involved.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
quite
the
fact
that
is
after
all
the
--
the
statute
reads
in
such
form
as
the
commission
may
prescribe.
they
haven't
complied
when
they
say,
“well,
you've
got
it
somewhere
in
your
files,
you're
suppose
to
do
it
the
way
the
commission
prescribes.”
now,
there
might
come
a
point,
i
should
presume
in
theory
where
the
commission
could
be
harrassing
them
to
such
a
point
that
the
court
wouldn't
award
penalties,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that
can
be
made
out
here.
then
one
finds,
the
black
part,
38%
where
there
hadn't
been
any
form
of
compliance
and
the
court
ordered
the
--
ordered
the
petitioner
to
comply.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suppose
mr.
lamb
and
i
would
differ
as
to
whether
they
were
debatable.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
haven't
added
them
up,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'm
sorry.
it's
now
about
$60,000.
the
other
part
of
the
case,
i
can
only
refer
to
very
briefly
i'm
afraid,
that
concerns
the
right
of
the
commission
to
obtain
the
copies
of
the
--
their
census
reports
which
were
retained
by
these
--
by
st.
regis
and
its
subsidiaries
when
they
made
required
reports
to
the
bureau
of
the
census.
the
courts
below
both
held
that
the
retained
copies
were
subject
to
subpoena
and
that
no
privilege
extended
here.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court,
we
discovered
that
the
government
was
sharply
divided.
the
federal
trade
commission
which
of
course
had
sought
to
obtain
the
reports
had
subpoenaed
them
in
one
instance
and
they
had
made
them
the
subject
of
this
order
for
a
special
report
here.
i
believe
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
any
privilege.
the
antitrust
division
and
the
justice
department
shares
that
review.
on
the
other
hand
the
bureau
of
the
census,
department
of
commerce,
and
the
bureau
of
budget,
all
feel
very
strongly
that
these
reports
are
frivolous.
and
each
agency
believes
that
its
interpretation
is
essential
to
enable
it
to
carry
out
its
statutory
functions.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
bureau
of
the
budget
has
a
general
interdepartmental
responsibility
for
trying
to
coordinate
the
statistical
activities
of
the
government
in
order
to
prevent
unnecessary
duplication.
and
most
report
forms
before
they're
set
out
have
to
be
approve
by
the
bureau
of
the
budget.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
wanted
the
position
of
these
various
agencies
to
be
cleared
of
court.
this
puts
the
solicitor
general
in
a
somewhat
difficult
position
and
it
had
been
by
hope
to
present
both
sides
of
the
question
as
fairly
as
i
could
and
to
--
we
have
sought
to
do
that
in
some
detail
in
our
brief.
my
own
personal
opinion
which
i
though
i
should
give
the
court
is
that
the
courts
below
are
wrong
and
that
these
retained
copies,
where
there
are
copies
of
required
reports
should
be
and
are
under
the
statute,
entitled
to
the
privilege.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
purely
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
and
i
think
that
one
can
put
it
briefly
perhaps
this
way.
first
place,
i
think
it
is
plain
that
those
who
say
there
is
no
privilege
have
the
better
of
it
on
the
words
the
statute.
now,
the
statute
says
neither
the
secretary
nor
any
other
officer
or
employee
of
the
department
of
commerce
or
bureau
or
agency
thereof,
except
as
provided
in
another
section
shall
give
out
this
information.
as
circuit
judge
lumbard
said,
“the
acts,
in
plain
terms,
applies
to
the
department
of
commerce.”
those
who
say
there
is
no
privilege
of
the
analogy
of
the
law
with
respect
to
retained
copies
of
income
tax
returns
the
point
because
there
it
is
held
that
in
private
or
public
litigation,
if
the
taxpayer
keeps
a
copy
of
his
income
tax
return,
it
maybe
subpoenaed.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
the
statute
--
the
statute
suggest
the
broader
coverage
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
in
the
income
tax
case,
there's
an
exception
that
could
be
made
by
the
president.
a
further
point
i
think
which
the
federal
trade
commission
and
others,
frankly,
a
considerable
course,
is
that
when
the
congress
did
wish
to
give
such
a
privilege,
it
apparently
knew
how
to
do
it
because
with
respect
to
some
of
the
reports
which
must
be
made
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
dealing
with
accidents
which
might
be
brought
in
question
and
litigation.
the
statute
expressly
says
that
they
are
not
to
be
subject
to
subpoena.
and
i
--
i
think
to,
i
want
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
there's
an
entirely
--
an
entirely
intelligible
view
of
policy
behind
the
commission's
interpretation.
i
say
intelligible,
not
necessarily
right.
the
commission's
view
is
that
the
policy
behind
this
statute
is
one
of
preventing
indiscriminate
publicity,
preventing
the
employees
of
the
census
bureau
from
giving
this
out
for
private
advantage
or
as
a
matter
of
favor
or
just
plain
carelessness.
but
they
say,
once
this
information
becomes
material
in
an
administrative
or
judicial
proceeding,
then
it
is
a
strong
public
policy
that
we
almost
recognize
in
favor
of
having
that
information
available
so
that
the
case
maybe
decided
on
the
best
possible
evidence.
and
this
is
a
matter
again,
i
think
it
must
be
conceded,
of
very
great
importance
in
the
administration
of
the
antitrust
laws,
after
all
to
get
a
picture
of
the
market
structure.
the
bureau
of
the
census'
universe
figures
and
the
breakdown
among
the
several
companies
is
the
best
way
to
get
a
picture
of
the
market.
now,
why
do
i
disagree
if
i
may
take
a
minute
on
that?
i
think
that
the
words
are
not
so
clear.
well,
my
view
has
the
worst
of
it
on
the
words,
are
not
so
clear
as
to
forbid
us
to
look
farther.
for
example,
to
some
cases
that
the
words
don't
seem
to
cover
which
i
--
where
i
think
the
information
is
clearly
frivolous.
suppose
that
a
company
has
signed
its
census
report,
but
hasn't
gotten
to
mail
yet.
it's
incredible
that
it
should
be
subject
to
subpoena
under
those
circumstances.
or
suppose
it's
returned
to
the
company
to
make
a
correction.
i
would
think
it's
plain
that
the
privilege
attached
to
it
then.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
policy
underlying
section
9
of
the
census
is
broader
than
the
one
that
i
suggest
it
could
be
attributed
to
it
that
its
policy
in
--
might
i
take
just
a
minute
your
honor
to
develop
that?
that
its
policy
is
--
well,
the
colloquial
way
to
put
it
is
to
make
sure
that
the
statistical
activities
of
the
government
leave
those
who
cooperate
neither
better
off
or
worse
off
than
they
would
be
if
the
statistical
activities
weren't
engaged
in.
to
put
it
more
specifically,
i
think
that
the
policy
is
to
remove
the
objections
or
otherwise,
it
would
be
to
the
census,
the
public
objection
arising
from
a
sense
of
unfairness.
if
the
government
gathered
this
information,
i've
got
you
to
cooperate
and
then
ride
away
from
it.
on
the
other
hand,
the
second
purpose
is
to
secure
the
cooperation
of
those
reports.
these
retained
copies
are
in
the
operations
of
the
census
bureau
of
very,
very
great
importance
in
order
to
get
accurate
figures
for
reasons
spelled
out
in
our
brief
at
greater
length.
there
must
be
consultations
between
the
census
experts
and
the
company,
economist,
and
statistician,
and
unless
the
company
has
a
copy
available,
the
consultations
can
be
carried
out
only
under
very
great
difficulty
if
at
all.
and
therefore,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
policy
of
section
9
is
one
that
says
that
this
information
gathered
by
the
government
for
statistical
purposes
shall
be
used
only
for
statistical
purposes.
and
there's
evidence
in
that
--
of
that
in
presidential
proclamations
and
committee
reports
cited
in
our
brief.
and
that
would
bring
this
case
down
to
the
question
whether
these
retained
copies
fall
within
the
category
of
information
requested
by
the
government
for
statistical
purposes.
one
can
argue
at
great
length
as
to
whether
the
companies
would
keep
the
copies
even
so
the
government
didn't
ask
them
to.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
commerce
department
does
ask
them
to.
and
in
my
judgment,
where
the
commerce
department
says,
“keep
this
for
our
purposes.”
and
then
it
does
not
lie
in
the
government's
mouth
to
say,
“oh,
you
would
have
kept
it
anyway,
and
this
isn't
something
that
was
done.”
for
the
government's
purposes,
you
would
have
kept
it
for
your
own
use,
maybe
so,
often
so.
but
i
think
that
where
the
government
has
said,
“keep
it,”
the
government
must
acknowledge
that
it
was
kept
because
it
wanted
to.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
in
this
instance,
i
should
say
that
the
various
agencies
agreed
with
me
and
hope
that
it
would
be
convenient
to
the
court
that
we
should
speak
with
one
mouth
here,
and
that
i
should
try
to
explain
all
views.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
it
were
only
--
no,
i
don't
think
that's
quite
the
situation.
if
were
only
the
antitrust
division,
your
honor,
i
think
we
could
take
care
of
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
--
the
answer
is
yes
and
no,
your
honor.
our
position
and
one
which
we
--
which
i
should
have
made
clearer
and
that
sought
to
emphasize
in
the
brief
is
that,
certainly,
the
underlying
information,
this
information
underlying
a
census
report
is
not
a
privilege
just
because
somebody
has
made
a
report
of
that.
indeed,
if
you
will
look
at
the
original
request
for
information
here,
you
will
see
that
they
asked
for
the
same
kinds
of
information
that
was
given
to
the
census
bureau
even
referred
to
the
census
code
numbers
to
show
what
they
wanted
and
then
the
company
came
back
and
said,
"well,
here
are
the
retained
copies
of
our
reports.
why
make
us
do
it
all
over
again?”
now,
there
is
this
difference.
while
much
of
the
information
could
be
obtained,
it
would
be
a
slower
and
in
some
ways
more
difficult
process.
some
of
the
information
given
to
the
census
bureau
contains
estimates.
there
are
estimates
where
you
could
give
a
number
of
figures
and
sometimes
honestly
and
haven't
come
out
quite
different.
when
the
federal
trade
commission
sought
to
get
it,
of
course,
counsel
would
screen
it.
when
it
goes
to
bureau
of
the
census,
it
is
more
candid
and
they
go
to
more
work
to
put
it
together.
so
that
there
would
be
--
there
would
be
in
my
judgment,
this
again
as
a
matter
of
argument,
there
would
be
in
my
judgment
a
considerable
hampering
of
the
federal
trade
commission's
processes.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
there
would
be
a
considerable
hampering
of
the
statistical
processes
if
you
held
that
there
was
no
privilege.
that's
why
there
are
these
different
views.
now,
if
i
might
say
just
one
sentence
or
two
if
i
may,
one
is
that
although
i
did
not
take
time
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
waiver
because
i
thought
i
should
get
to
the
merits
of
this
question.
we
do
insist
that
the
voluntary
furnishing
of
copies
of
census
report
had
destroyed
the
privilege
of
confidentiality.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
think
--
we
think
it
is
because
we
are
the
respondent
here
and
that
it
is
open
to
us
to
seek
to
defend
the
judgment
below
on
any
ground.
thank
you.
