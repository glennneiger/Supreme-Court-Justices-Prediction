justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
sole
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
sole
question?
is
that
the
sole
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
government
hasn't
denied
that
this
question
is
raised,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
raise
some
other
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
counsel
at
the
original
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
were
they
selected
by
the
defendant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
believe
that's
not
rare
in
this
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
the
issue
which
you're
now
raising,
substantive
issue,
was
canvassed
at
the
original
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
the
defendant
had
the
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
missed
if
--
i
missed
if
you
told
us,
was
there
--
were
there
minutes
of
the
--
of
the
original
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
now
in
existence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they're
available
to
us
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
in
the
transcript,
oh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
in
the
--
the
last
part
of
your
statement
is
not
on
the
affidavit
of
counsel,
is
it
as
i've
quickly,
hurriedly
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
get
from
the
counsel's
affidavit
is
that
they
communicated
with
the
wife.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
advised
her
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
how
they
should
prosecute
in
an
appeal.
she
indicated
that
she
will
discuss
it
with
her
husband
and
suggest
that
he
will
request
court-appointed
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
they
--
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
changed
--
that
changed
their
professional
status?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i,
too,
have
the
difficulty
that
my
brother
stewart
has
in
understanding
what
it
is
really
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided.
as
you
put
it,
as
you
stated
to
us,
it
would
cover
a
case
where
there's
just
one
--
which
is
exactly
like
the
following
variant
that
i
put
to
you
namely,
that
there
is
no
controversy
that
at
the
end
of
the
first
trial,
although
as
counsel
tell
a
defendant
that
he
may
appeal,
he
said,
“no,
i
want
to
get
through
with
this
thing.”
as
you
stated,
he
may
change
his
mind
subsequently
and
raise
it
on
the
2255.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
he
may
forego
his
appeal
on
the
merits
on
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
purposely
didn't
want
to
use
that
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
judge
washington
took
care
of
that
situation.
if
you
will
turn
to
page
150
of
the
record,
judge
washington
said,
“but
absent
a
showing
of
a
real
miscarriage
of
justice,”
“absent
of
a
showing
of
a
real
miscarriage
of
justice,”
so
that
--
in
addition
to
what's
found
on
page
152,
i
don't
very
well
see
how
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
the
court,
it
will
be
as
black
and
white,
is
the
issue
that
you
present
in
this
court
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
yes
that's
because
he
assumed
that
a
man
may
forego
the
right
to
appeal
and
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
it,
that's
what
your
position
is,
you
say
although
there's
a
clear
foregoing
of
the
right
to
appeal
on
the
merits
of
an
issue
that
was
properly
presented
to
the
jury
or
even
the
question
where
that
was
properly
presented
to
the
jury,
you
can
then
go
over
that
same
round
all
over
again
under
2255
in
lieu
of
an
appeal.
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
say
in
this
case,
then
you'll
introduce
all
of
the
elements
of
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
the
government
position
is,
we'll
hear
it,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
now
is
precisely
what
it
is
we
have
to
adjudicate
in
this
case?
and
to
me,
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
sayings
where
there
was
a
constitutional
claim,
duly
canvassed
at
trial,
appropriately
considered
or
pursued
perhaps
erroneously
considered
for
which
the
remedy
is
appeal,
automatic
right
as
appeal
and
that
automatic
right
of
appeal
has
been
foregone
not
because
of
any
unfairness
in
--
to
the
defendant
that
the
appeal
wasn't
taking
because
it
wasn't
taken
with
eyes
wide
open
whether
in
such
a
situation,
you
may
then
go
over
the
same
ground
instead
of
an
appeal
in
--
under
2255.
now,
i
must
--
if
that's
your
position,
i
understand
the
position,
and
i'm
clear
what
it
is
i
have
to
decide,
but
once
you
enter
other
elements,
then
you're
within
judge
washington's
opinion
where
he
talks
about
absent
or
showing
of
a
real
miscarriage
of
justice
which
includes
the
right
to
appeal
from
an
adverse
finding
of
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
can't
they
tell
whether
it
has
or
hasn't
if
they've
got
the
minutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
--
if
one
--
if
one
accepts
that
the
generality
of
that
proposition,
then
i
think
that
i,
at
least,
would
have
great
difficulty
in
that
holding,
that
no
matter
how
solemnly
a
fellow
says,
“i
going
to
get
through
with
this
business,
i
don't
want
an
appeal,”
he
may
change
his
mind
five
years
later
because
he's
being
held
under
unconstitutionally
invalid
process.
i'm
agreeing
with
the
logic
of
your
conclusion
if
your
starting
point
is
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
can
you
say
he
can
do
it
right
away
quick,
but
he
can't
do
it
five
years
later
or
keep
on
doing
as
long
as
he's
in
jail?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
suggesting,
that
if
you're
right
just
--
to
keep
on
just
as
long
as
he's
confined,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i'm
assuming
it
isn't
frivolous
on
the
face.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
even
assuming
that
--
i'm
even
assuming
that
one
has
the
right
to
say
if
he
had
appealed,
there
would
have
been
a
good
chance
of
a
reversal,
i'm
assuming
all
that.
what
you're
saying
is
although
with
eyes
wide
open,
that
as
a
matter
of
right,
he
could
have
appealed
contemporaneously,
he
forewent
that
right
and
can
--
can
invoke
it
two
years
later,
three
years
later,
or
five
years
later,
as
long
as
he
is
incarcerated
under
a
constitutionally
infirmed
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
i
read
judge
washington
to
have
written.
he
says
in
the
absence
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
which
i
undertake
to
mean,
that
he
was
first
of
all
he
was
forbidden
to
talk
with
his
lawyer,
and
he
was
an
ignorant
man
or
an
uninformed
man
and
he
didn't
know
he
had
a
right
of
appeal
or
he
was
told
by
the
attorney
that
he
didn't
have
a
right
of
appeal
or
he
was
in
physical
or
psychological
circumstances
so
that
he
didn't
take
in
the
situation,
that's
what
i
would
say
is
covered
by
miscarriage
of
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
that
when
the
record
shows
that
there
was
a
right
of
appeal,
of
course,
the
record
doesn't
show
that,
that's
the
law,
and
that
due
communication
was
made
of
this
right
and
recommendation
was
made
to
the
wife
of
the
defendant
who
had
hired
him
because
fee
or
no
fee
seems
to
me
immaterial,
wholly
immaterial,
you
said
the
status
of
a
lawyer
whether
he
accepts
the
fee
or
doesn't
accept
the
fee,
that's
a
question
of
compassion
or
a
whim
or
whatnot.
if
you
got
circumstances
that
we
have
here,
then
you
will
say
that
--
that
he
has
a
right
to
collateral
review
of
what
he
chose
not
to
review
unless
some
exceptional
circumstances
have
to
be
shown
why
he
shouldn't
have
it.
in
my
view,
boot
is
on
the
other
foot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
o'connell,
this
case
is
very
important
to
your
client?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
of
even
greater
importance
in
view
of
the
issue,
it
is
even
a
greater
importance
to
the
administration
of
justice.
therefore,
it
becomes
a
very
important,
you
as
well
as
for
us,
for
the
counsel,
as
well
as
for
us,
to
explore
the
meaning
of
all
these
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
robinsons,
there
were
compassionate
situations
which
made
(inaudible)
one's
appealing
and
the
court
held
that
despite
all
of
that,
when
congress
said,
and
from
my
point
view,
it's
great
wisdom
that
appealed
in
criminal
cases
must
be
taken
within
the
brief
period
because
one
of
the
curses
of
our
administration
of
justice
is
its
laggardness,
it's
delayed.
we're
talking
about
--
about
delays
in
civil
cases,
forget
about
the
consequences
of
delays
in
criminal
cases
are
far
greater
consequences
to
the
administration
of
justice.
and
this
court
was
compelled
to
conclude
that
when
congress
said
10
days,
it
meant
10
days.
now,
what
you
are
saying
--
what
you
are
claiming
is
that
with
reference
to
these
so
called
fundamental
claim
duly
tried
at
the
trial
but
not
appealed
from,
the
function
of
2255
disregard
the
10-day
limit
on
appealability
and
that
therefore,
2255
may
be
used
for
all
practical,
not
all
for
practical
purposes,
may
be
used
as
though
there
were
no
10-day
limit.
and,
if
i
may
conclude
my
observation
in
order
to
elicit
yours,
what
was
the
purpose
of
2255?
did
it
have
anything
to
do
with
this
or
was
it
the
alleviation
of
the
riggers,
partly
the
riggers,
partly
the
inconvenience
of
the
habeas
corpus
and
to
substitute
habeas
corpus
for
the
2255
procedure
so
that
the
sentencing
court
may
dispose
of
it
rather
than
wherever
he
was
locked
up
all
over
the
united
states?
and
therefore,
the
question
to
my
mind
arises
whether
there's
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
2255
that
give
greatest
scope
to
2255
than
the
old
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
would
this
mean
--
would
this
has
been
the
habeas
corpus?
was
this
--
would
habeas
corpus
have
issued
on
this
record,
in
this
case,
in
these
circumstances,
on
these
affidavits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
know
whether
it
should.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
it
would
have
on
the
basis
of
the
precedence
of
this
court
and
the
general
conception
of
the
relation
of
habeas
corpus
to
non-appealability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
o'connell,
i'd
like
to
express
your
views
with
reference
to
habeas
corpus
in
sunal
against
--
in
the
sunal
case
this
court
rejected
those
views.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
a
basic
--
for
me
it's
a
basic
error
if
some
one
has
to
go
to
jail
when
he
shouldn't
go
to
jail
because
this
court
had
declared
that
the
statute
of
the
circumstances
do
not
warrant
that
he's
going
to
jail.
and
he
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
not
taking
an
appeal,
namely
a
series
of
opinions
holding
against
him,
and
every
good
lawyer
would
have
thought
that
it's
futile
to
do
that.
and
later,
there
was
a
change
in
the
law,
and
he
goes
and
tried
to
get
habeas
corpus
and
he
was
blocked
by
this
court
despite
the
dissenting
opinion
in
this
--
in
that
case
pointing
out
the
flexibility
of
habeas
corpus.
when
you
talk
about
constitu
--
fundamental
error,
if
fundamental
--
it's
a
fundamental
error
to
be
sent
to
jail
on
a
statute
which
doesn't
cover
a
man.
that's
a
fundamental
error.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
found
any
case
in
which
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
sought
in
circumstances
fairly
comparable
to
this
and
in
which
the
writ
issued,
and
if
it's
issued
for
the
writ
of
a
state,
have
you
found
any
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
measure
of
2255
is
habeas
corpus
then
that's
the
standard
by
which
we
must
judge
2255?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
an
easy
--
bowen
is
an
easy
way
of
disposing
of
a
thing
if
you
don't
have
to
reach
an
ultimate
issue.
that
isn't
the
case
i'm
putting
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
thought
i
was
instructed
by
sunal
that
habeas
corpus
can't
displace
the
right
of
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
this
case,
it's
--
which
is
what
you're
asserting
what
judge
fahy
asserted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
that
that's
the
label
--
a
different
label
for
the
same
contents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
outset
of
your
argument,
you
told
us
that
was
the
only
question
in
the
case.
there
wasn't
anything
else
to
appeal
about
it,
namely,
the
admissibility
of
his
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rosenberg,
before
you
go
on
to
--
into
these,
to
me
always
cloudy
metaphysical
distinction,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
without
arguing,
but
just
state
what
the
government
position
in
this
case
is,
on
this
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
imagine
--
i
can't
imagine
that
mr.
o'connell
would
agree
your
statement
of
fact,
i
suppose.
what
you
are
saying
is,
or
are
you
saying
is,
that
when
the
facts
are
developed
in
the
trial
court,
the
judge
as
a
matter
of
law
is
a
directive
that
the
confession
was
inadmissible
because
coerced,
isn't
that
what
he
would
trade?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
must
be
some
underlying
legal
document
in
which
he
sets
forth
his
claim.
isn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
where
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
for
certiorari
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
2255?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
was
there
a
--
was
there
an
amended
motion
for
relief
under
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
2255?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
--
then
that's
our
charter
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
are
we
just
at
large
and
just
talking
like
newspaper
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
explain
the
counsel
not
to
do
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
--
i
haven't
heard
a
word
from
mr.
o'connell
about
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
some
document
or
just
in
talk?
was
there
a
--
was
there
an
amended
--
i
asked
you
a
minute
ago,
was
there
an
amended
motion
that
new
counsel
made
by
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
did
that
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
in
that
--
in
that
request
for
supplementing
the
record,
was
there
a
claim
made
which
is
now
before
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
claims
aren't
made
in
the
briefs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
do
i
understand
you
in
view
what
you
just
said
that
no
--
that
the
court
submitted
or
allowed
rather
the
confession
to
go
to
the
injury
on
a
charge
as
to
what
the
duty
of
the
--
jury
was
that
such
instructions
were
not
accepted
to
by
the
defendant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
was
then
defended
by
two
lawyers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
know
--
but
now
they
sought
it
to
be
raised
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
confession
was
improperly
submitted,
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
first
--
i
should
like
to
ask
you
one
further
question,
were
any
requests
made
by
the
defendant
at
the
original
trial
which
were
denied?
i
asked
you
and
you
said
that
there
was
no
exception
taking
to
what
the
court
charged.
now,
i
ask
you,
did
defendant's
counsel
ask
for
instructions
on
the
question
of
admissibility
of
coercion
which
was
denied
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
exception
was
taken
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
mr.
o'connell.
i
may
have
misunderstood
him
to
say
that
all
the
trial
minutes
are
in
this
record,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
a
five-day
trial.
i
know
--
it's
hard
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
we've
got
within
the
covers,
within
this
brown
covers
the
testimony,
the
objection
to
its
submission
to
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
charge
of
the
court
to
the
jury
and
leaving
the
confession
for
their
evaluation.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
where
is
that
ms.
rosenberg?
i
mean,
this
--
please
help
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
on
page
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
but
really,
how
can
you
--
i'm
total
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know,
i
was
--
i
was
under
the
impression
if
i
read
this
brown
volume,
i'd
find
all
that's
relevant
in
the
determination
of
what
took
place
at
the
trial.
now,
you
tell
me
that
isn't
so
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
no
question
that
he
then
and
there
asked
not
only
to
--
to
withdraw
the
confession
or
not
be
allow
the
submission
of
the
confession
to
the
jury,
but
he
also
in
the
alternative
suggested
that
if
it
is
submitted,
the
following
charge
will
be
given.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
we
barred
from
doing
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
based
on
the
face
of
a
record,
the
lower
court's
judgment,
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
is
right,
must
we
send
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
say
will
you
--
we've
got
all
the
facts
before
it,
we've
got
the
whole
record,
the
legal
issue
is
exposed
but
for
one
reason
or
other
convenient
or
incompetence
or
whatnot,
we
send
it
back
and
ask
you
to
make
a
legal
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
see
that
that's
sometimes
desirably
to
be
done.
if
it's
to
be
done
(inaudible)
if
we
just
practice
on
the
next
april,
it
would
be
five
years
since
this
trial
started.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
determine
whether
on
the
face
of
a
record
and
issue
was
raised
than
we
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
only
a
little
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
we
can
decide
those
hypothetical
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
o'connell,
before
you
sit
down,
there
is
one
question
on
which
i
need
enlightenment.
you
are
in
the
--
you
are
in
the
appeal
and
you're
being
appointed
by
the
court,
it
naturally
makes
your
service
to
us,
all
of
them
are
welcome,
you
were
before
--
you
argued
the
appeal
before
the
panel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
judge
fahy
writing
from
himself
and
judge
martin
with
the
conclusion,
decided
what
he
did
on
december
30th,
1959,
that's
nearly
two
years
ago
and
then
there
was
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
and
that
was
granted
and
we
have
the
disposition
on
the
--
of
the
en
banc
court
that's
now
before
this
court.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
any
new
materials
--
legal
materials
other
than
briefs,
whether
any
new
applications,
modifications
of
prior
pleadings,
were
there
anything
that
comprehensibly
called
pleadings
or
request
for
change
the
record
was
made
before
the
disposition
on
the
panel
appeal
and
the
disposition
before
the
full
bench.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
dated
after
december
30th?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
saying,
was
there
anything
before
the
court
en
banc
that
wasn't
before
judge
fahy's
panel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
--
that
counsel's
affidavit
merely
says,
not
merely
says,
the
counsel's
affidavit
said
that
they
told
the
wife
who
had
hired
them
--
who
had
retained
them,
i
beg
your
pardon,
who
had
retained
them
that
he
should
appeal,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
light
we
get
on
the
non-appeal
--
on
the
absence
of
an
appeal
from
the
original
trial
was
counsel's
affidavit
to
the
wife
to
the
person
who
retained
them
that
they
thought
an
appeal
should
be
pursued.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
that's
--
that's
the
only
difference
between
matters
that
were
before
judge
fahy
when
he
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
panel
and
the
matters
that
were
before
judge
fahy
when
he
wrote
his
dissent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
weren't
they
before
the
panel
when
judge
fahy
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they've
accepted
it.
those
affidavits
were
--
the
affidavit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
have
a
case
here
that
soon
will
have
its
fifth
anniversary
from
the
day
of
the
trial
and
soon
will
have
its
fifth
anniversary
and
today
there
has
been
a
succession
of
three
different
lawyers
at
different
stages
adjusting
themselves
quite
rightly
to
new
situation
in
legal
opinion
such
as
the
mallory
opinion.
new
lawyers
came
in
and
adjusted
themselves
to
the
mallory
opinion.
they
raised
that
then
those
lawyers,
i
don't
how
or
why
they
disappeared
but
then
you,
as
the
matter
of
public
service
were
appointed
and
now
we've
got
some
new
grounds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
is
so,
then
we've
got
it
all
before
us
and
we
are
just
as
competent
to
decide
on
what
is
on
the
phase
of
records
as
anybody
else
below.
indeed
--
indeed
if
what
you
say
then
it's
our
duty
to
say
whether
there
was
any
traversable
or
any
real
so-called
fundamental
right
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
we
must
shut
our
eyes
what's
between
this
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
we
must
send
it
back
to
the
judges
(inaudible).
now,
with
another
goal
and
case
comes
back
here
about
two
years
from
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
in
the
court
of
appeals.
they
each
got
interested
and
there
are
great
big
issues.
judges
like
lawyers
like
to
be
with
great
big
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
wouldn't
--
why
weren't
those
affidavits
there
--
they
were
in
physically
existence?
it's
difficult
for
me
to
understand
why
they
weren't
available
to
the
panel.
the
fact
that
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
fact
that
a
district
judge
said
legally
not
relevant,
it
didn't
take
them
out
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
about
another
panel
there
for
the
record
and
i
can't
imagine
that
one
panel
can't
found
out
what
another
panel
did
in
the
same
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
these
panels,
the
independent
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
there's
no
doubt
that
he's
a
good
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
no
doubt
is
a
good
logical
conclusion?
after
all,
this
is
one
case
and
it's
still
a
one
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
next
person
told
me,
it
was
a
new
panel
--
a
different
panel,
so
evidently,
they
are
a
different
(inaudible)
