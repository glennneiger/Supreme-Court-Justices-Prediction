justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
o'connell,
may
i
ask
this
footnote
of
judge
fahy
at
page
153
of
the
record,
this
footnote
1
to
the
effect
that
in
section
2255
proceedings
heretofore
had,
the
district
court
found
that
in
all
hearing
that's
the
confession
and
voluntaries
--
is
that
this
very
proceeding?
was
it
in
fact
a
--
a
hearing
allowed
here
on
this
application?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
--
my
question
is
if
that's
so
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
now
what
kind
of
hearing
is
it
you
want
your
client
to
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
with,
(inaudible)
so
we
could
try
this
case
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
also
heard
the
motion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ms.
rosenberg,
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
this
if
you
don't
mind
me
interrupting
you
for
a
minute.
well,
judge
fahy's
first
opinion,
what
significance
do
you
attach
to
the
last
paragraph,
page
146?
this
is
his
first
opinion
for
the
panel.
particularly,
and
the
facts
of
the
case
do
not
lead
us
hold,
but
nevertheless
justice
requires
that
appellant
should
be
granted
relief.
what
--
what
is
he
referring
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
look
at
the
records,
that's
what
i
was
wondering.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
this
mean
at
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
the
record
on
the
merits
of
the
coercion
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
a
--
but
a
--
with
particular
reference
to
the
merits
of
the
coerced
confession
claims.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that's
what
this
is
referring
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
are
saying
is
--
if
he
finds
it
involuntary
then,
of
course,
he
never
should
have
received
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
finds
it
voluntary,
he
resubmits
for
jury
determination
the
issue
of
voluntariness
as
well
as
credibility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
point
is
in
this
case,
certainly
the
issue
of
voluntariness
as
well
as
of
credibility
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
ms.
rosenberg?
as
you
said,
there
was
a
hearing
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
counsel
there
took
the
position
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
facts
established
that
this
was
involuntary,
and
therefore
that
the
judge
had
not
admit
it
an
evidence
or
did
he
take
that
position
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
or
did
counsel
take
that
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
--
well
now,
the
fact
--
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
that
time.
but
i
want
--
to
get
to
is
this
--
in
the
district,
what's
the
practice
if
the
issue
of
voluntariness
is
resolved
by
the
judge
against
you
that
is
in
the
sense,
if
he
says
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
confession
was
not
involuntary.
how
do
you
preserve
that
for
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
trial
then
--
what
i'm
trying
to
--
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
agree
(inaudible)

william
j.
brennan,
