ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problems
of
this
case
become
easier
to
understand
and
i
think
easier
solution,
if
we
realize
that
the
term
“coerced
confession”
really
embodies
two
concepts
that
are
quite
different.
and
one
i
can
call
a
“claim
as
an
error
of
law”
and
one
is
the
“claim
as
an
error
of
fact”
and
i
think
part
of
the
confusion
in
this
case
is
that
it's
never
been
quite
clear
whether
we're
talking
about
a
claim
as
an
error
of
law
or
a
claim
as
an
error
of
fact.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
government
position
on
this
record
is
the
petitioner
is
claiming
that
his
confession
is
coerced
because
the
jury
should
have
believed
his
evidence
and
not
the
government's
evidence
and
that
that
is
what
i
call
the
issue
of
fact
and
that
that
is
not
cognizable
by
motion
under
2255.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
that's
our
basic
position.
we
have
felt
that
the
question
of
whether
the
error
--
what
i
call
the
error
of
law
is
cognizable
is
within
the
grant
of
certiorari
and
we
have
been
dealt
–
compelled
to
discuss
it,
but
our
(voice
overlap)
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
understand
him
to
claim
this.
i
think
it
has
--
this
is
what
i've
said,
what
i've
thought
the
confusion
stems
from.
i
think
nobody
until
now
has
made
that
sharp
a
distinction
between
this
factual
basis
of
his
claim
and
the
legal
basis
of
his
claim
because
here,
he
has
not
discussed
the
admissibility
of
the
confession,
but
in
the
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals,
this
was
discussed.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
only
--
in
--
oh,
you
mean
his
petition
for
writ
of
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
it
is
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
there
is
in
the
record
his
petition,
his
application
for
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
2255.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
which
is
at
page
1
of
the
record.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
this
was
drawn
by
counsel
other
than
present
counsel
and
this
is
only
significant
as
a
guide
because
in
this,
he
makes
assertions
which
are
contrary
to
the
trial
record.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
to
some
extent,
we
already
had,
your
honor.
this
is
just
one
of
the
difficulties
in
this
case.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
this
is
one
of
the
difficulties
in
this
case.
in
his
--
in
his
application
for
2255,
counsel
made
assertions
of
facts
without
any
relation
to
the
trial
record
at
all.
he
also
made
self-assertions
with
regard
to
a
narrower
point,
not
a
claim
of
coercion.
as
i
read
the
judge's
findings
of
fact
on
that
motion
under
2255,
what
seems
to
have
been
obvious
at
great
length
was
more
of
the
narrower
points
in
any
claim
of
coercion.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
no,
just
--
i'm
just
trying
to
give
the
history
mr.
justice
frankfurter
of
what
happened
to
this
case.
it's
the
case
--
the
application
under
2255
had
been
denied.
it
went
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
there
was
a
long
delay
in
the
change
of
counsel.
it
was
new
counsel
who
raised
the
claim
of
coercion.
it
turned
out
on
the
appeal
from
the
2255.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
there
was
merely
a
motion
for
the
record.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
they
merely
asked
for
the
record
and
it
turned
out
that
the
record
was
lost,
the
record
of
the
hearing
on
the
2255.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
you
honor
the
only
thing
that
is
before
--
not
before
this
court
because
the
claim
such
as
they
were
appear
in
the
briefs,
is
what
their
claiming.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
is
true,
your
honor.
that
is
where
the
claims
are
made
in
this
case,
except
to
the
extent
of
the
motion
under
2255,
it's
there
in
the
government's
answer
which
sets
forth
the
fact
that
this
was
before
the
jury
and
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
lower
--
the
district
court.
the
only
indications
that
are
there,
that
there
was
no
hearing
in
the
sense
of
calling
witnesses.
it's
also
true
that
the
transcript
of
record
was
then
not
available
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
based
on
that
--
and
as
--
as
i
read
these
findings
--
well,
coercion
was
thrown
in,
actually,
the
argument
in
the
district
court,
now
that
we
had
come
down
after
the
conviction
and
before
this
motion
under
2255,
as
i
read
the
findings
that
was
the
brunt
of
the
discussion
down
there.
and
that's
one
of
the
difficulties
in
this
case,
that
it
has
never
actually
been
pinpointed
what's
the
basis
of
this
claim
of
coercion
is
in
the
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court
to
the
extent
that
counsel
discussed
it.
they
talk
about
coercion
as
a
matter
of
law
the
basis
on
the
defendant's
evidence
at
the
trial
without
setting
forth
the
controverting
evidence
by
the
government.
there
has
never
that
i
know
of
a
statement
by
the
defendant
which
we
think
is
absolutely
essential
before
you
have
any
real
problem
of
the
scope
of
2255
to
the
effect
that
on
undisputed
facts,
there
--
there
was
coercion
as
a
matter
of
law.
there
is
a
claim
of
coercion
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
the
claim
of
coercion
as
a
matter
of
law
is
based
on
an
accepted
--
of
the
--
of
the
defendant's
evidence
in
the
case
and
on
a
rejection
of
a
government's
evidence
which
in
some
respect
is
directly
contrary.
the
basic
claim
of
coercion
was
that
the
washington
police
said
they
turned
him
over
to
the
chicago
police
if
he
didn't
confess,
that
washington
police
absolutely
denied
this.
there
were
circumstances
in
the
record
to
make
this
incredible
on
its
face.
the
issue
of
--
of
whether
there
was
coercion
was
an
issue
which
went
to
the
jury
un
--
under
instructions
at
to
which
there
was
no
exception
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
only
claim
that
is
or
on
this
record
could
possibly
be
made
in
this
case
is
that
there
was
a
coerced
confession
because
the
jury
should
have
believed
the
defendant
and
not
the
government's
evidence.
and
on
that
issue,
which
is
our
position
that
this
is
not
only
as
justice
stewart
points
out,
not
only
--
not
cognizable
under
2255,
but
actually
would
not
have
been
a
case
on
direct
appeal.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
know
why
the
court
of
appeals
did
that.
certainly,
the
government
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
think
not
because
when
the
original
court
decided
this
--
when
the
panel
decided
this
case,
they
were
unaware
that
these
--
these
document
had
been
filed
and
had
been
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals
that's
having
come
to
allege.
so
that
i
think
what
happened
is,
there
was
a
long
delay,
your
honor,
between
the
noting
of
an
appeal
under
2255
and
the
appointment
of
new
counsel
and,
i
think
that
the
real
difficulty
has
been
that
people
talk
in
general
terms
about
a
coerced
confession.
and
i
think
that
the
difference
between,
as
i
say,
shorthand
way,
i
have
putting
it,
your
honor,
is
that
coercion
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
is
coercion
because
he
should
have
believed
me
and
not
the
government's
evidence.
that's
the
question
of
fact,
the
underlying
fact.
and
the
difference
between
coercion
as
a
matter
of
law
was
not
clear
and
there
maybe
grievance
with
this.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
question
of
coercion
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
that
although
the
opinion
makes
the
assumption
that
there
maybe
an
issue
of
law
that
they're
going
to
decide
the
issue
of
law.
i
think
that
it
is
a
judgment
of
having
looked
at
the
record.
this
is
not
striking
at
the
case
where
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
at
the
record
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
by
this
the
time,
the
record
is
from
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
the
record
of
the
trial
was
before
the
court.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
this
was
this
about.
i
think
that
having
looked
at
the
merits,
this
does
not
--
this
is
--
this
is
the
way
i
read
it.
i
don't
know.
that
this
did
not
strike
him
in
the
case
where
there
was
such
a
serious
question.
i
don't
think
he
was
undertaking
to
decide
it.
i
think
that
primarily
on
facts
that
there
is
now
before
the
court
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
a
case
called
lancey
in
which
judge
fahy
also
dissented,
and
this
was
the
case
where
the
defendant
had
taken
an
appeal
but
had
not
raised
the
confession
issue.
but
there
he
said
he
thought
there
was
to
be
a
hearing
out
of
confession.
i
assume
he
thought
the
facts
were
more
questionable,
i
believe,
i
forget
that's
my
guess.
well,
as
i
--
i
think
that
i
don't
have
to
argue
at
very
great
length
that
if
we
are
right
about
the
issue
in
this
case,
that
it
is
clear
that
this
is
not
--
that
the
question
here
is
--
the
question
of
the
court
of
appeal
talks
about
is
academic
because
--
well,
it's
very
difficult
to
be
dogmatic
about
habeas
corpus
and
2255.
i
thought
that
one
thing
one
could
be
dogmatic
about
is
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
either
habeas
corpus
or
2255
to
decide
the
kinds
of
issues
of
fact
which
were
properly
submitted
to
the
jury
for
its
resolution.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
the
context
of
the
record,
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
a
much
more
debatable
question.
we
like,
the
court
of
appeals,
think
that
even
so
the
issue
should
not
be
cognizable
on
2255,
but
this
takes
--
this
involves
the
great
length
of
difference
kinds
of
considerations
than
we
have
in
the
situation
which
we
think
this
case
presents,
where
you
don't
even
have
that
claim
that
is
--
let's
get
back
where
i
started.
there
is
one
claim
which
is
i
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
a
coerced
confession
because
the
jury
should
have
believed
me
and
not
the
government's
evidence
and
that's
what
we
think
is
this
case.
there
is
another
possible
claim
under
2255
and
that
is
on
the
undisputed
facts
as
they
were
developed
in
a
hearing
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
it
was
an
error
of
law
for
the
judge
to
have
permitted
to
go
--
the
confession
to
go
into
evidence
and
to
have
submitted
the
issue
of
voluntariness
to
go
to
the
jury.
that's
the
way
it
would
arise
in
the
district
of
columbia,
your
honor,
because
the
district
of
columbia
follows
that
rule
that
the
judge
hold
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
decide
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
confession
should
not
go
into
evidence,
but
that
if,
there
is
evidence
from
which
a
jury
which
it
believed
the
jury
could
find
voluntariness
and
evidence
where
the
defendants
find
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor
and
in
the
district
of
columbia,
at
least,
and
in
most
of
the
federal
courts,
the
judge
does
not
undertake
to
--
to
resolve
the
issues
of
credibility.
it's
clear
in
the
district
of
columbia,
it's
clear
in
some
of
the
circuits.
it's
not
so
clear
in
some
of
the
other
circuits.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
yes.
they
were
--
specifically,
the
judge
--
there
was
a
specific
request
for
instructions
on
that,
the
instructions
were
in
fact
given,
and
counsel
accepted
them.
there's
just
no
question
about
it.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
i'm
saying
that.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
as
i
say,
one
of
my
difficulties
is
that
i'm
not
quite
clear
what
the
defendant
is
raising,
but
as
i
read
this
record
--
as
i
read
this
record,
he
can't
assert
that.
and
as
i
read
what
he
has
said,
he
has
discussed
the
so
called
issue
on
the
merits
only
in
the
footnote
in
his
brief
in
this
court,
but,
in
his
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court,
as
i
read
his
claim
of
coercion,
it
is
based
on
the
defendant's
testimony
which
was
given
both
at
the
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
and
then
the
defendant
took
the
stand
at
the
trial
of
the
case
and
the
argument
that
this
was
coercion
as
the
matter
of
law
based
--
is
based
on
believing
the
defendant's
testimony.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
they're
not.
all
in
--
all
the
testimony
relating
to
the
confession
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
the
instructions
are
at
page
139
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
i
--
i
propose
one
can
say
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
the
fact
is
if
you
read
this
testimony,
the
facts
being
submitted,
hence
will
--
was
putting
out
a
lot
more
stuff
in
his
argument
on
an
example.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
you
would
object
to
its
admissibility
and
evidence
and
that
was
preserved
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
if
the
judge
admitted
it,
one
would
accept
to
the
admission
of
the
confession
as
evidence
and
this
was
preserved
in
this
case
because
counsel
did
object
to
the
admission
of
the
confession
as
i
say
i
read
it
more
as
--
basing
his
confession
more
on
the
(inaudible)
grounds,
but
he
did
object
to
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
exactly,
not
if
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
page
82
is
the
judge's
ruling
and
there
was
a
(inaudible).
well,
i
don't
know
if
the
exception
is
here,
but
there
was
a
ruling.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
don't
mean
--
i
mean
i
don't
think
the
exception
is
printed,
your
honor,
that's
what
i
meant.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
what
there
is
here
is
--
on
page
81,
“(inaudible)
would
you
know
summarize
your
reading
why
you
feel
the
court
should
not
make
its
ruling
at
this
time
in
the
manner
indicated?”
and
it
is
--
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
he
objected
to
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
and
also
at
the
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
what
happened
is
on
page
139.
“you
haven't
(inaudible)
my
counsel
after
the
charge.
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
you
charged
the
jury.
they
were
to
determine
whether
the
confession
was
voluntary
or
involuntary.”
and
then
the
court,
“make
this
charge,”
and
then
on
page
140,
“any
objection
on
the
part
of
the
charge
to
either
counsel?”
the
bottom
of
page
140,
“no.”
that's
in
the
record.
what
is
not
printed
as
i
say
is
the
exception
because
that
was
raised
primarily
on
the
mcnabb
doctrine
and
was
not,
at
this
court,
relevant
to
say.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
your
honor.
i
--
we
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
problem.
our
main
point
is
that
insofar
as
one
can
make
out
what
defendant
is
alleged.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
the
defendant
--
oh,
let
me
put
it
affirmatively
kind
of
way,
the
defendant
has
not
alleged
that
on
the
undisputed
facts,
there
was
coercion
as
a
matter
of
law
that
he
has
alleged,
that
his
claim
of
coercion
is
based
on
the
claim
that
the
jury
should
have
believed
him.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
don't
think
the
court
--
i
think
the
court
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
chose
a
broad
position.
i
think
the
court
considered
it
to
this
extent.
the
court
took
the
broad
position
decision
that
whether
it
was
one
or
the
other,
whether
it
was
a
claim
that
it
was
error
to
admit
case
in
evidence
as
the
matter
fact
or
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
issue
was
not
cognizable
under
2255.
so
the
court
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
distinguish
between
the
two.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
went
far
beyond
what
was
necessary
for
it
to
do
decide
this
case,
yes
your
honor.
the
government
has
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
brings
me
to
that
question.
i
think
it
was
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
is
a
much
harder
question
than
the
one
that
we
think
--
that
we
think
this
case
presents.
i
think
--
and
therefore,
it
is
our
view
that
you
simply
don't
have
to
reach
it
because
that
on
this
record,
there
is
a
very
clear
and
almost
uncontrovertible
ground
that
is
that
it
is
not
--
there
are
no
decisions
that
i
know
of
which
hold
that
if
an
issue
was
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
that
that
issue
can
be
canvassed
on
2255.
now,
the
other
question,
assuming
it
was
here
that
whether
the
judge
made
a
mistake
as
the
matter
of
law
in
allowing
confession
to
go
into
evidence
and
then
allowing
it
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
this,
we
think,
is
a
different
question
and
while
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
we
realize
that
this
involves
a
much
more
difficult
question.
this
court
has
held
with
respect
to
state
cases
that
even
though
a
defendant
has
appealed
his
conviction
and
has
sought
certiorari
in
this
court,
the
issue
of
whether
a
state
has
used
a
coerced
confession
--
confession
is
cognizable
by
motion,
by
habeas
corpus
in
the
state
court
and
i
take
it
that
this
is
a
largely
the
basis
of
petitioner's
argument.
he
is
saying,
what
you
held
about
state
trials
ought
to
carryover
to
the
federal
trial.
we
think
it
clearly
should
not
do
so
in
the
situation
where
there
has
been
an
appeal
or
there
has
been
a
very
conscious
election
not
to
appeal
because
the
situations,
as
i
say
in
federal
cases,
are
different.
the
leading
case
that
established
the
right
to
attack
a
state
court
conviction
through
habeas
corpus
is
the
case
of
brown
against
allen.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
in
a
sense
articulated
its
reason
for
allowing
that
matter
to
be
brought
up
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings
in
the
district
court
even
though
it
has
been
reviewed
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
and
as
i
--
we
understand
that
case,
the
reason
was
this,
since
1867,
when
congress
in
the
habeas
corpus
act
provided
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
extends
to
a
prisoner
in
state
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
federal
court
has
its
duty
to
make
sure
that
a
state
conviction
has
not
been
in
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
now,
on
direct
review,
the
only
court
that
can
carry
out
that
duty
would
be
this
court
and
the
volume
and
the
difficulties
set
forth
in
brown
against
allen
were
(inaudible).
it
was
felt
for
this
reason
that
the
matter
should
be
deemed
subject
to
review
in
a
federal
court
--
the
federal
district
court
subject
to
review
by
a
federal
court
of
appeals
and
then
ultimately
before
this
court.
but
of
course,
that
doesn't
apply
in
a
federal
case.
in
a
federal
case,
this
very
same
district
judge
is
applying
these
very
same
standards,
the
federal
standards
which
govern
state
proceedings
and
federal
proceedings
and
so
forth.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
this
--
that's
a
different
case
again
from
the
one
we
have
and
that's
different
from
the
general
one
that
i'm
in
--
petitioner
to
be
arguing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
with
the
--
with
the
claim
of
defect
of
procedure,
i
think
they
may
well
be
an
issue.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
should
say
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
i
suppose
that
--
that
will
limit
that,
your
honor.
let's
limit
it
to
the
situation
where
there
is
no
claim
in
the
defect
of
procedure
at
this
trial
or
the
standard
where
the
only
claim
is
that
--
well,
it's
a
matter
of
law,
but
the
claim
of
so
called
error
of
law
is
really
a
mixed
error
of
law,
in
fact,
the
claim
is
that
in
applying
a
proper
standard,
the
court
misinterpreted
the
facts.
now,
this
court
has
said
with
regard
to
confessions
that
while
it's
bound
by
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
trier
of
fact,
what
actually
happened,
the
interpretation
of
the
facts
are
whether
as
a
--
whether
those
admitted
facts
amount
to
coercion
as
the
matter
of
law.
this
court
has
said
as
a
fact,
“a
federal
court
isn't
bound
by
the
state
court's
findings
and
presumably,
an
appellate
court
is
not
bound
by
the
district
court's
finding”
and
that's
where,
i
think,
the
debatable
area
comes
in
generally,
not
this
case,
but
generally.
assuming
--
and
that's
where
we
come
to
the
question
i
take
it
of
the
right
of
appeal.
it
seems
to
me
in
the
normal
case
where
defendant
has
taken
an
appeal
or
where
he
could
have
taken
an
appeal
and
consciously
elected
not
to
do
so,
even
if
he's
now
claiming
that
the
district
court
erred
in
the
interpretation
of
the
fact,
that
this
is
a
matter
which
he
should
have
urged
on
appeal
and
that
it
should
not
be
re-litigated
before
the
same
court,
and
again
subject
to
the
same
standards
just
saying,
“well
maybe,
you'll
might
have
changed
your
mind,”
where
we
get
into
a
few
more
difficult
areas
unquestionably
is
if
we
could
be
said
that
district
court
made
a
mistake
in
its
interpretation
of
the
fact
and
i
didn't
appeal,
but
my
appeal
was
based
on
excusable
neglect.
now,
we
had
that
kind
of
case,
that's
when
we
come
to
what
is
the
question
that
i
think
(inaudible)
the
court
below,
wouldn't
it
--
we
think
is
--
i
say
now,
is
hypothetical
in
this
situation.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
but
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
district
court?
the
district
court,
your
honor,
had
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
confession
was
coerced,
but
it's
--
all
its
conclusions
of
law
relates
to
the
mallory.
oh,
if
you're
talking
about
the
question
of
the
right
of
appeal
that
comes
to
this
court
in
a
very
unsatisfactory
fashion,
because
the
notes
of
the
hearing
are
lost,
the
hearing
on
the
2255,
but
so
far
as
one
can
tell
from
the
petition
itself
and
the
answer
and
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
conclusion
of
law,
the
district
judge,
that
issue
was
not
raised
before
the
district
court.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
but
i
don't
read
that
as
being
a
decision
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
an
excusable
neglect
to
fairness
--
to
appeal.
i
think
that's
a
legal
conclusion
that
this
is
normally
the
kind
of
error
that
is
to
be
raised
on
appeal.
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell
and
as
far
as
i've
been
able
to
check
is,
this
issue
was
not
before
the
district
court.
what
happened
was
that
when
new
counsel
came
in
at
the
court
of
appeals
stage,
they
filed
this
motion
to
supplement
the
record.
this
was
in
august
1959.
it
was
two
years
after
this
--
there
was
a
long
delay
here
on
the
appeal
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
these
affidavits
were
filed
and
so
we
never
had
a
hearing
on
that
issue.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
fahy's
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
as
i
read
judge
washington's
opinion,
your
honor,
i
think
this
does
not
go
as
far
as
your
honor
summarized
before.
i
think
that
what
he
is
saying
here
is
that
on
the
facts,
which
defendant
have
alleged
in
their
affidavits,
we
do
not
find
that
kind
of
excusable
neglect
which
would
justify
a
hearing
and
which
would
require
that
the
defendant
be
allowed,
relief
under
2255
even
if
it
normally
would
not
be
available
for
the
claim.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
what
he's
saying
is
--
there
--
i
think
--
i
think
that
it
is
not
simply
a
question
of
conscious
failure
to
appeal
or
excusable
neglect.
i
think
that
he's
recognizing,
shall
i
say
three
positions.
one
is
a
good
reason
for
not
appealing.
for
example
--
well,
the
most
obvious
one,
if
the
government
presented
in
taking
appeal
but
even
in
the
situation
where
the
government
didn't
present
it
in
taking
an
appeal,
for
example,
i
would
say
that
we'd
have
a
different
case
if
one
could
say
a
defendant
had
been
abandoned
by
counsel.
counsel
suggests
the
minutes
--
the
judge
pronounced
the
sentence
(inaudible)
did
nothing
at
all.
that
might
be
another
case.
as
i
read
the
opinion,
it's
saying
what
you
showed
here
would
simply
something
that
might
be
an
excuse
for
getting
a
brief
(inaudible)
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
fact
on
page
6.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
--
yes,
well,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
he
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
confessions
made
to
mem
--
to
members
of
the
metropolitan
police
department
was
voluntary
and
was
not
the
result
of
coercions,
threat
or
promises.
now,
it's
perfectly
shows
that
his
conclusions
of
law
in
the
same
document
don't
deal
with
the
question
of
coercion,
they
deal
what
the
question
of
mcnabb
and
mallory.
now,
he
has
come
down
and
(inaudible)
as
i
said
just
before
that.
i
think
what
--
if
--
but
it
seems
to
me
this
record
makes
it
reasonably
informed
guess
that
the
main
thrust
of
the
argument
before
him
which
has
been
(inaudible),
the
record
of
that,
was
on
the
basis
of
mallory
which
had
just
come
down
and
that's
why
he
dealt
with
those
in
his
conclusions.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it
is
right
except
to
this
extent,
that
in
his
motion
under
2255,
which
was
before
the
district
court,
the
defendant
did
make
allegation
of
coercion.
he
did
make
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
i
am
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on
the
question
in
its
broadest
aspect,
and
if
there
was
a
much
narrower
basis
for
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
i
am
saying
that
all
the
defendant
claims
was
that
his
confession
was
coerced.
but
that
when
--
when
looked
at
his
allegations
of
coercion,
one
sees
that
his
allegations
of
coercion
amount
to
as
if
he
had
said,
“my
--
my
confession
was
coerced
because
the
jury
should
have
believed
in
me
and
not
the
government.”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
don't
want
to
decide
on
the
question
of
pleadings
on
--
in
the
sense
of
a
pleading
because
he
didn't
use
the
right
words.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
any
2220
--
in
any
motion
under
2255,
by
the
terms
of
the
motion,
the
record
is
part
of
the
motion
because
the
motion
may
properly
be
denied
if
the
files
and
records
show
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
no
relief.
and
we
are
saying
that
if
you
read
defendant's
allegation
in
the
light
of
what
--
of
the
record
which
is
part
of
the
case,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
not
just
in
words,
but
in
essence,
he
is
saying,
“i
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
a
coerced
confession
because
the
jury
didn't
believe
me,”
and
that
we
say
is
not
a
cause
of
action
under
2255.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
if
--
well
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
this
point?
yes,
your
honor,
because
what
we
are
saying
is
that
on
this
record,
he
could
not
make
an
allegation
which
would
present
the
constitutional
issue.
our
position
is
that
it
is
not
a
constitutional
issue.
you
don't
even
make
a
claim
of
a
failure
of
constitutional
right
if
all
you
are
saying
is
the
jury
should
have
believed
me
that
that's
not
the
constitutional
issue.
when
this
court
has
talked
about
the
use
of
a
coerced
confession,
as
violating
a
constitutional
right,
it
has
done
so
because
it
says
on
the
facts
that
are
not
in
dispute,
there
is
coercion
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
that's
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
now,
when
on
this
record,
you
cannot
say
that
if
the
government's
evidence
is
believed,
there
was
coercion.
and
since
this
record
is
before
--
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case,
yes,
we
say
that
since
it
is
his
allegation
has
to
depend
on
the
allegation
that
the
jury
should
have
believed
him
and
not
the
government's
evidence,
he
has
not
stated
the
cause
of
action
and
he
cannot
state
the
course
of
action.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
his
own
testimony
at
the
trial
is
contrary
to
that,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i'm
saying
his
allegations
in
light
of
the
files
and
the
record
in
the
case
which
under
the
statute,
under
28
u.s.c.
2255,
a
judge
has
a
right
to
deny
an
application
on
the
basis
of
the
files
and
record.
he
doesn't
have
to
be
bound
by
this
bare
pleading.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
every
time
he
had
talked
about
the
coercion,
now
this
--
this
is
the
brief.
this
is
the
only
place
it
has
come.
his
claim
of
coercion
is
based
on
his
own
testimony
at
the
trial
and
it
is
not
taken
into
account
the
contradictory
testimony
of
the
government.
there
are
some
allegations
that
were
not
directly
contradicted.
there
were
some
that
were
directly
contradicted.
the
chicago
policemen
who
arrested
him
on
the
basis
of
a
request
from
washington
testified,
and
who
was
in
charge
of
making
the
arrest,
testified
insofar
as
he
knew,
defendant,
without
a
question,
held
by
the
chicago
police,
defendant
himself
said
and
he
--
oh,
let
me
say
the
chicago
police
then
said,
“we
had
(inaudible)”
and
he
was
the
man
in
charge
and
the
defendant
said
that
it's
some
other
chicago
policemen,
not
the
ones
there,
questioned
him
for
30
minutes
as
three
different
--
three
or
four
different
times
during
the
day
he
was
held
before
the
washington
police
got
there.
the
real
threat
that
the
defendant
testified
to
was
that
he
said
that
the
washington
police
said
to
him,
“if
you
don't
confess,
we'll
turn
you
back
to
chicago.”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
thank
you
your
honor.
before
i
get
into
my
argument,
i
want
to
say
this
that
i
entered
a
hypothetical
question
your
honors
as
to
what
would
happen
if
the
district
court
applied
an
erroneous
standard.
it
is
a
theoretical
question
in
relation
to
this
case
and
i
don't
mean
to
bind
the
government
for
--
for
some
future
case.
i
said
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
question.
i'm
not
sure
just
where
we
come
out,
but
certainly,
whatever
difficulties
they
were,
it
would
be
if
the
standard
that
is
applied
was
an
unconstitutional
thing
that
it
not
just
grab
an
erroneous
phraseology.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it's
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
that
would
be
a
part
of
the
federal
court
since
i
guess
the
standard
that
the
federal
court
has
been
in
existence
now
for
many,
many
years
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
coercion
has
not
been
a
major
problem
in
federal
trial.
there
hasn't
been
the
decision
by
this
court
on
the
subject
since
warne
against
the
united
states
and
there
really
have
been
very
few
in
the
courts
of
appeal
particularly
since
mcnabb
and
even
before
that,
it
was
not
one
of
the
major
problems
in
federal
criminal
law.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
we
had
nothing.
it
is
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
government
in
its
end
has
suggested
that
we
would
file
a
full
answer
after
this
case
was
there,
lampe,
virgil-lampe,
l-a-m-p-e
i
think
it's
400
(inaudible).
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
before
recess,
i
was
just
pointing
out
that
--
well,
this
admittedly
comes
before
the
court
in
a
fairly
unsatisfactory
fashion
because
of
the
change
of
counsel
and
then
change
of
empathy
and
so
on.
it
seemed
to
us
that
when
petition's
allegations
are
read
against
the
record,
it
is
quite
clear
that
he
is
claiming
that
the
jury
should
have
believed
him
and
that
his
allegations
depend
on
his
own
testimony.
and
i
just
want
to
summarize
briefly
so
that
the
court
will
know
what
we
base
this
on.
the
government
evidence
was
that
the
chicago
police,
having
received
both
information
implicating
petitioner
and
a
confession
by
a
codefendant
implicating
petitioner
got
a
warrant
and
send
it
to
florida
where
they
thought
petitioner
was,
they
then
learned
he'd
gone
to
chicago
and
so
they
called
the
chicago
police
and
asked
them
to
make
the
arrest.
the
chicago
--
the
government
brought
one
chicago
policeman
to
testify
at
the
trial
that
was
the
man
who
was
in
charge
of
making
the
arrest
and
who
participated
in
the
arrest.
his
testimony
was
that
he
was
admitted
peaceably
and
that
he
told
petitioner
he
was
wanted
in
washington
and
that
he
asked
whether
petitioner
had
any
guns
and
petitioner
showed
them
to
him
and
he
seized
the
gun.
there
was
no
--
it
was
completely
a
peaceful
arrest
on
sunday,
april
29.
now,
petitioner
was
held
from
april
29
until
may
1st.
he
wasn't
brought
before
magistrate
on
april
30th
because
the
chicago
police
hadn't
got
a
warrant,
but
at
the
time
he
was
arrested,
the
petitioner
said
he
would
go
back
to
washington
and
on
may
1st
in
formal
proceedings
before
a
chicago
police
court
judge,
he
waived
extradition
and
agreed
to
return
to
washington.
the
washington
police
got
to
chicago
on
may
2nd,
they
asked
the
petitioner
about
the
crime
and
he
denied
being
implicated
until
he
was
shown
the
confessions
of
the
two,
his
brother
and
another
codependent
at
which
point
he
made
a
confession.
the
chicago
policeman
testified
that
when
he
made
the
arrest,
he
talked
to
the
petitioner
about
the
warrant,
but
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
petitioner
made
no
admission
and
he
said
so
far
as
he
knew
petitioner
was
not
further
questioned
although
he
was
off
the
next
day
because
--
and
he
did
say
they
had
other
things
to
do.
when
petitioner
was
brought
back
to
washington,
he
repeated
his
confession
before
the
victim
of
the
robbery.
now,
petitioner
at
the
trial
testified
that
the
chicago
police
had
their
guns
drawn
when
they
arrested
him.
he
said
that
various
officers,
not
the
one
who
testified
at
the
trial,
had
him
in
three
or
four
lineups
where
there
was
no
questioning
and
that
he
was
questioned
three
or
four
times,
never
for
more
than
30
or
40
minutes
while
he
was
held
before
he
was
--
before
he
waived
extradition
on
may
1st.
a
cross-examination
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
not
repeated
before
the
jury,
he
testified
that
the
chicago
police
roughed
him
up
a
little
bit,
but
admittedly
he
made
no
confessions
or
admissions
to
chicago
police
and
admittedly,
the
chicago
police
were
very
nice
to
him.
now,
the
only
real
threat
that
--
to
which
he
testified
was
the
chicago
police
did
that
he
would
be
turned
over
to
the
chicago
police
--
the
washington
police
said
he
should
know
--
the
chicago
police
if
he
didn't
confess.
the
washington
police
denied
any
threat.
now,
there's
a
certain
inherent
incredibility
in
the
alleged
threats
since
admittedly
from
the
time
the
chicago
police
picked
him
up,
they
told
him
he
was
in
washington
and
admittedly
on
may
1st,
he's
waived
extradition.
on
this
basis,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
claim
of
coercion
was
at
best,
a
question
for
the
jury
which
as
i
have
said
was
submitted
to
the
jury
under
instructions
that
were
not
accepted
to,
that
were
specifically
accepted
by
trial
counsel.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
petitioner
cannot
allege,
it's
not
merely
a
form
of
words,
we
think
he
cannot
allege
that
on
the
undisputed
evidence,
there
was
coercion
as
a
matter
of
law
and
therefore,
we
think
he
cannot
even
allege
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
insofar
as
to
discuss
that
question,
discussed
the
hypothetical
question.
