mr.
quinn
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
it
poses
the
question
of
whether
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
in
a
federal
court
and
who
has
failed
to
file
a
timely
appeal
because
he
neither
knew
nor
was
advised
of
his
appellate
rights
may
nevertheless
be
granted
a
hearing
under
title
28,
section
2255
to
determine
whether
his
conviction
was
invalidly
based
upon
a
coerced
confession
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
the
pertinent
facts,
as
we
see
them,
are
these.
the
petitioner
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
pardon.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that
is
the
question
that
we
feel
is
presented
in
the
case,
your
honor.
the
government
has
interposed
certain
other
questions,
but
they
have
met
this
particular
question.
this
was
the
question
that
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
was
the
question
which
was
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
was
granted.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
john
hodges
was
tried
and
convicted
of
robbery
on
the
basis
of
the
confession
which
was
admitted
into
evidence
over
his
objection
that
it
was
coerced
and
involuntary.
no
appeal
was
taken
from
this
conviction.
about
three
months
after
the
time
for
appeal
had
expired,
the
petitioner
filed
a
motion
to
vacate
the
sentence
under
section
2255
on
the
ground
that
the
conviction
was
based
upon
a
coerced
confession
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
the
district
court
denied
the
petition.
an
appeal
was
taken
from
this
denial
of
the
district
court.
in
the
course
of
this
appeal,
it
was
discovered
that
the
reporter's
notes
for
the
section
2255
hearing
had
been
lost.
as
a
result,
the
court
ordered
the
preparation
and
filing
of
the
trial
transcript
as
a
supplemental
record
on
appeal.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
pardon
me.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
i
--
i
do
not
know
because
there
was
no
transcript.
the
only
thing
that
we
have
is
the
district
court's
opinion
in
that
matter,
where
all
he
said
was
a
hearing
was
held
and
the
counsel
on
both
sides
were
present.
what
was
submitted
at
that
hearing,
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
yes,
there
was.
there
were
two
counsels.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
they
were
not
court-appointed,
your
honor.
however,
they
served
on
the
basis
that
they
knew
that
the
petitioner
and
his
wife
had
no
money
and
they
were
serving
without
fee.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
they
were
selected
by
the
defendant's
wife
and
in
that
sense
they
were
retained,
but
they
will
do
--
they
were
serving
without
--
they
knew
this
at
the
time
when
they
were
selected.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
the
major
defense
because
the
major
evidence
was
that
this
confession
was
involuntary.
the
only
evidence
that
--
upon
which
this
conviction
is
based
is
the
confession
which
was
introduced
in
(inaudible)
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that
is
right,
your
honor.
but
on
the
basis
of
this
trial
transcript,
and
the
appeal
from
the
denial
of
2255
hearing,
the
court
of
appeals
assumed,
without
deciding,
that
the
conviction
was
based
upon
a
coerced
confession,
but
they
held
that
the
--
that
this
conviction
was
not
subject
to
collateral
attack
because
of
the
supreme
court
decisions
which
constrained
the
court
to
decide
in
this
case.
the
collateral
attack
was
not
available
in
a
complete
absence
of
any
attempt
to
excuse
the
failure
to
appeal.
now,
it
became
apparent
from
this
--
from
this
--
the
panel's
decision
that
the
panel
was
unaware
that
the
petitioner
had
attempted
to
show
the
court
of
appeals
why
he
had
failed
to
appear
because
there
was
no
trial
transcript
to
the
2255
hearing
which
--
at
which
time
evidence
might
have
been
presented,
which
did
show
why
an
appeal
was
not
taken.
the
petitioner's
counsel
who
has
been
appointed
by
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
supplement
the
record
with
the
affidavits
of
the
petitioner
and
of
his
trial
counsel.
he's
at
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
yes,
there
were
minutes
of
the
original
trial.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
they're
in
existence
and
they
were
prepared
and
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
appeal
from
the
denial
of
2255
hearing
and
the
supplemental
record
on
appeal.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
they're
in
the
--
they're
in
the
transcript
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
but
also,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
transcript
of
record
on
page
15
are
the
affidavits
of
the
petitioner
and
the
--
an
affidavit
signed
by
his
two
trial
counsels
which
show
that
--
that
the
petitioner
--
as
far
as
the
petitioner
was
concerned,
this
was
the
first
arrest
of
--
that
he
had
other
than
minor
traffic
violations,
he
was
not
versed
of
the
--
the
law
that
he
had
no
idea
that
there
was
a
10-day
appeal
period
and
that
he
was
not
advised
by
his
counsel
of
his
rights
to
appeal.
the
affidavits
of
this
trial
counsel
substantiate
this.
they
say
that
at
the
sentencing,
since
they
knew
that
they
weren't
receiving
no
fee
or
compensation,
that
the
prisoner
was
taken
away
after
sentencing
before
they
had
had
a
chance
to
discuss
anything
with
him,
but
they
did
advise
his
wife
after
the
petitioner
was
gone
that
they
thought
he
had
good
grounds
for
appeal.
and
then
they
felt
that
their
representation
was
over,
and
with
that,
the
prisoner
went
to
--
went
to
prison
and
was
not
advised
by
his
wife
or
anyone
else
during
the
critical
10-day
period
when
he
could
--
could
have
appealed
from
his
conviction.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
no,
that
is
in
the
affidavit
of
the
--
of
the
petitioner
that
--
do
you
mean
the
idea
that
his
wife
had
not
advised
him
during
the
10-day
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that
we
strongly
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that
is
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that
is
what
they
did
say.
they
did
not
talk
to
the
petitioner
himself.
it
was
--
she
had
--
she
had
evidently
hired
him,
from
what
the
record
shows.
but
the
petitioner
for
all
practical
purposes
went
to
jail
and
nobody
advised
him
of
his
rights.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
pardon.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
they
did
--
they
obtain
his
--
his
services,
the
counsel
services
but
at
the
time
that
they
obtained
these
services,
they
told
the
counsel
if
they
did
--
could
not
afford
to
pay
anything
and
asked
them
if
they
would
take
the
case.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
i
don't
believe
so,
but
in
the
light
of
the
court
of
appeal's
original
decision
on
--
of
the
three-judge
panel,
it
became
apparent
that
they
were
unaware
that
there
had
any
attempts
to
excuse
the
failure
to
appeal.
and
on
this
basis
--
well,
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
these
affidavits
when
they
were
attempted
to
--
when
we
attempted
to
supplement
the
record
with
them,
a
different
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
attempt
to
supplement
the
record
per
curiam.
and
the
panel
that
decided
the
case
on
the
merits
was
unaware
that
this
attempt
had
been
made,
it
seemed
very
apparent.
so,
that
the
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
with
the
court
to
point
out
that
these
affidavits
had
been
filed
and
that
there
--
that
the
petitioner
had
attempted
to
excuse
the
failure
to
appeal
since
that
was
the
basis
of
the
court's
opinion
that
--
we're
trying
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
and
on
--
on
the
basis
of
the
petition
for
rehearing,
the
court
vacated
their
initial
decision
and
on
their
motion
set
the
case
down
for
rehearing
en
banc.
now
the
question
that
they
--
that
they
sought
the
counsel
to
discuss,
the
rehearing
en
banc
was
a
limited
one.
i'd
like
to
read
it
to
you.
it's
whether,
and
so
i'm
reading
this
from
page
15
of
the
government's
brief
and
up
--
the
respondent's
brief,
it
appears
in
the
record
at
page
146,
147.
“the
question
is
whether
the
appellant,
either
in
the
affidavits
filed
in
this
court
or
otherwise,
has
made
such
a
showing
as
to
entitle
him
to
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
on
the
question
of
whether
notwithstanding
his
failure
to
appeal
directly
from
the
judgment
of
conviction,
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
the
district
court,
on
the
right
he
claims
to
attack
collaterally
under
28
u.s.c.
section
2255,
the
validity
of
the
judgment
of
conviction
on
the
basis
of
the
admission
and
evidence
of
an
alleged
coerced
confession.
now
on
the
basis
of
that
question
and
after
rehearing,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court
again
with
three
judges
dissenting.
the
holding
of
the
majority
in
that
court
i
believe
is
important
because
i
think
it
does
define
with
precision,
the
specific
issue
which
should
be
here
under
review.
the
majority
ruled
that
section
2255
is
simply
not
available
to
challenge
an
unappealed
conviction
based
upon
a
coerced
confession
regardless
of
the
reasons
for
failing
to
appeal
whether
excusable
or
not.
the
majority
assumed
again
without
deciding
that
the
petitioner's
confession
was
coerced
and
that
his
failure
to
file
a
timely
appeal
was
excusable.
they
said
in
these
circumstances,
it
makes
no
difference.
collateral
attack
is
just
not
available.
judge
fahy's
opinion
which
he
wrote
for
the
three
dissenting
judges
is
also
directed
to
this
very
same
issue,
but
he
couldn't
agree
that
and
i
quote
judge
fahy,
“that
the
courts
must
say
to
the
person
imprisoned
under
a
basically
invalid
sentence
that
the
law
affords
no
remedy
because
although
he
did
not
know
and
was
not
advised
of
his
appeal
rights,
he
should
have
appealed
anyway.”
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
what
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
--
i
believe
that
the
reasoning
of
judge
washington
was
that
there
was
no
basic
right
denied
here
because
he
had
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
the
--
the
--
judge
washington
also
referred
to
judge
fahy's
original
opinion
which
he
said
that
in
most
respects,
he
was
glad
to
agree
and
that
opinion
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
a
coerced
confession
would
--
well,
one
of
the
things
that
was
based
upon
was
that
it
was
assumed
that
there
was
a
coerced
confession.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
this
is
what
we
say.
we
say
that
he
has
made
a
claim
of
a
coerced
confession
and
that
this
claim
is
that
a
basic
right
has
been
denied
and
if
that
claim
is
true,
it
is
--
then
his
conviction
is
based
upon
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right.
and
we
say
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
that
claim
with
the
subsequent
appellate
review
of
any
determination
at
that
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
read
it,
say
that
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
--
we
don't
have
to
get
into
the
question
whether
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
his
allegation
because
here,
we've
got
the
trial
transcript
and
there
wasn't
any
coercion.
so,
what
they
are
arguing
is
that
--
is
that
we
shouldn't
decide
whether
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing
because
in
this
case,
he'd
be
unsuccessful
anyway.
well
--
what
i
say
is
that
this
is
a
--
this
is
not
that
--
this
is
a
closer
question
and
the
government
would
admit.
the
government
says
that
just
because
john
hodges
alleges
that
the
confession
was
coerced,
doesn't
make
it
coerced.
but
i
say
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
our
--
our
contention
of
course
is
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
court
erred
in
submitting
this
to
the
jury
and
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
is
a
coerced
confession.
this
question
was
presented
to
the
court
--
the
court
of
appeals.
not
a
single
one
of
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
assumed
that
the
claim
was
frivolous
or
they
would
certainly
have
--
would
seem
decided
on
that
ground
rather
than
on
a
more
difficult
ground
that
they
don't
have
authority
to
grant
relief
in
this
case,
regardless
of
whether
its
on
the
merit.
he's
--
the
merit
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
i
believe
that
anytime
that
a
person
has
a
merit
--
a
claim
of
substance
that
his
conviction
is
based
upon
the
denial
of
a
basic
constitutional
right,
that
collateral
remedies
are
available.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
if
he
has
waived
his
rights.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
in
the
context
of
the
cases
this
court
has
--
in
which
this
court
has
discussed
collateral
remedy,
certainly
there
are
occasions
where
--
there
are
exceptional
circumstances
present
which
would
allow
collateral
attack
even
though
an
appeal
was
not
taken.
we
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
it's
--
it's
--
it's
our
opinion
that
--
that
judge
washington
did
assume
that
even
though
the
confession
was
coerced
that
the
mere
failure
of
his
right
to
appeal
is
the
area
where
there
was
no
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
in
--
in
this
case
to
limited
--
yes,
yes.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
no,
i
would
say
yes,
that
is
our
position.
our
position
is
that
it
--
well
actually,
there
are
--
there's
a
broad
position
and
a
narrower
position.
one
is
that
where
this
claim
of
a
basic
right
has
at
--
the
conviction
is
based
upon
the
denial
of
a
basic
right
is
made
that
absent
some
of
the
fact
that
is
frivolous,
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
that
claim
because
that's
what
sub
--
that's
what
the
purpose
of
collateral
remedies
are,
and
this
is
regardless
of
whether
there's
an
appeal
or
not.
this
is
the
same
as
it
would
be
in
--
in
many
other
areas
that
might
be
claimed
where
--
which
could
have
been
raised
on
appeal,
but
were
not
raised
on
appeal.
but
later,
the
courts
have
held
the
collateral
attack
was
--
was
available
because
it
was
necessary
to
do
substantial
justice.
now,
i
--
i
would
say
that
in
this
case,
if
the
--
if
the
court
is
going
to
limit
the
availability
of
the
writ,
that
certainly
they
shouldn't
limit
it
where
in
--
for
all
practical
purposes,
there
was
no
opportunity
for
a
person
to
appeal.
now,
we
get
back
to
the
merits
of
his
claim.
now,
it
seems
to
me
what
the
government
seems
to
argue
is
that
--
well,
in
some
cases,
there
is
--
it's
very
clear
that
it's
a
coerced
confession.
and
in
those
cases,
surely,
we
would
give
collateral
--
we
would
allow
collateral
remedy
and
then
there
are
other
cases
which
well,
there's
just
a
little
maybe
a
coercion
maybe
or
it's
not
as
clear,
but
i'm
saying,
unless
it's
absolutely
frivolous,
he's
entitled
to
a
judicial
determination
of
whether
or
not
this
claim
--
his
claim
that
this
confession
was
coerced
is
true.
it's
only
a
judicial
determination
of
this
basic
constitutional
issue
that
will
--
will
offer
him
any
protection.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
no
different
rule
should
apply
here
than
applies
when
a
district
court
under
2254
considers
the
claim
that
a
--
a
confession
was
coerced.
and
there,
this
court
has
held
that
the
review
of
the
trial
transcript
absent
any
other
unusual
showing
would
probably
be
sufficient
for
the
court
to
make
that
decision.
actually
in
this
case,
the
court
--
the
case
was
presented
on
the
basis
of
the
trial
transcript.
and
so,
i
would
think
it's
discretionary
with
the
district
court
judge
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
to
allow
additional
evidence
if
there's
some
proper
of
additional
evidence
which
he
feels
maybe
appropriate
to
the
decide
the
question
which
is
the
important
one
of
whether
this
confession
is
coerced
or
not,
then
i
will
assume
that
it's
within
his
discretion
to
allow
additional
evidence.
in
this
case,
no
addition,
we're
not
relying
on
additional
evidence
although
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
proper
at
the
2255
hearing
since
the
transcript
of
that
hearing
is
--
is
not
available.
and
our
position
really
is
that,
in
meeting
the
government's,
we
haven't
briefed
or
--
or
--
or
we
weren't
prepared
to
argue
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
trial
transcript
does
show
a
coerced
confession
because
that
question,
we
haven't
thought,
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
had
decided
only
that
he's
not
entitled
to
have
that
question
decided
in
our
view.
and
we
think
that
the
trial
transcript
does
clearly
show
that
this
confession
was
involuntary
as
the
matter
of
law
and
that
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
obtaining
of
this
confession
are
far
more
compelling
than
many
of
the
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
where
they
have
held
that
a
confession
was
coerced
and
a
conviction
should
be
set
aside
because
it
was
based
upon
that
coerced
confession.
we
don't
feel
at
that
--
that
question,
we
don't
feel
has
been
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
merits
of
the
claim.
in
our
--
in
our
view,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
has
merely
held
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
have
this
question
heard
collaterally.
and
we
say
that
this
is
a
stringent
rule
that
--
and
i
would
like
get
into
what
we
consider
the
--
the
--
the
balances
which
are
involved
here
and
which
the
court
relied
upon
as
opposed
to
what
we
would
say.
that
the
important
thing,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
majority
and
the
dissent
below
both
seem
to
in
our
view
agree
upon
the
issue
that
where
there
is
no
direct
appeal
but
a
later
collateral
attack
based
upon
a
coerced
confession
introduced
into
evidence
and
even
though
there's
good
reason
for
failure
to
appeal,
the
majority
says
that
the
availability
of
the
remedy
should
be
denied
and
the
minority
said
that
its
certainly
should
be
granted
in
that
--
in
that
case.
and
this
is
an
issue,
if
we
can
agree
upon
the
issue,
that
has
never
been
passed
upon
by
this
court
and
we
think
that
it
is
a
--
that
it
is
--
this
issue
is
in
sharp
focus
here.
of
course,
there's
no
point
in
going
in
to
the
--
the
fact
that
this
--
the
court's
decision
was
regard
to
coerced
confession
and
their
effect
upon
basic
constitutional
right.
this
has
been
held
time
and
time
again
by
this
court
to
be
fundamentally
--
render
the
proceedings
fundamentally
unfair
and
of
mere
pretense.
but
in
order
to
focus
upon
the
--
this
concept
of
the
affect
of
a
coerced
confession
on
a
trial,
in
relation
to
the
availability
of
collateral
remedies,
i'd
like
to
discuss
very
briefly
four
decisions
of
this
court
which
i
believe
was
in
the
context
of
these
decisions,
this
case
must
be
decided.
first
is
in
1939,
the
bowen
v.
johnson
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
was
determining
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus.
the
--
the
court
made
this
--
the
distinctions
there
between
the
availability
of
the
writ
for
--
to
review
constitutional
errors
or
--
and
mere
errors
of
law.
actually,
in
that
case,
it
was
a
technical
jurisdictional
question
which
--
and
there
had
been
no
appeal
from
the
conviction
and
the
question
was
whether
the
united
states
had
jurisdiction
over
certain
park
lands.
the
court,
in
that
case,
held
that
due
to
the
exceptional
circumstances,
even
though
there
hadn't
been
an
appeal
from
the
conviction
that
they
would
allow
him
to
collaterally
attack
the
conviction
on
the
basis
of
this
technical
jurisdictional
question.
the
court
did
then
undertake
to
resolve
the
issue
which
the
petitioner
had
claimed
all
though
he
--
they
resolved
it
against
him,
but
it
was
an
--
a
legal
issue
that
was
presented
there
which
the
court
did
permit
the
person
to
--
to
raise
collaterally
even
though
he
had
not
filed
a
direct
appeal.
and
again
in
sunal
v.
large
in
1947,
the
court
was
concerned
specifically
with
the
failure
to
appeal
on
the
right
of
collateral
attack
of
a
conviction
and
there
again,
the
court
distinguished
between
error
--
an
error
depriving
a
person
of
a
constitutional
right
and
a
mere
error
of
law,
saying
that,
“that
the
writ
is
not
designed
for
collateral
review
of
errors
of
law
committed
in
a
trial
court.”
in
that
case,
there
had
been
no
appeal
from
the
conviction,
but
the
court
had
determined
that
the
--
that
the
defendant
deliberately
chose
not
to
appeal.
and
also,
that
court
determined
that
the
error
that
was
being
charged
was
not
a
constitutional
proportions.
and
for
these
reasons,
the
court
denied
the
right
to
collateral
attack,
but
the
court
also,
in
dictum,
pointed
out
illustrative
instances
where
the
failure
to
appeal
would
not
bar
collateral
attack.
and,
one
of
these
was
specifically
mentioned
where
the
trial
or
sentence
by
a
federal
court
violated
specific
constitutional
guarantees.
it
seems
apparent
from
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
sunal
that
the
remedy
of
habeas
corpus
would
have
been
available
in
that
case
if
the
claimed
error
had
been
a
constitutional
proportion
despite
the
failure
and
in
despite
that
the
volunteer
--
the
deliberate
choice
that
he
had
failed
to
appeal.
now
since
the
sunal
case,
this
thinking
of
the
court
has
become
crystallized
in
the
case
of
jordan
against
the
united
states
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1956.
now,
we
have
relied
strongly
on
jordan
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
rely
heavily
upon
the
jordan
decision
in
this
court
because
we
think
that
the
jordan
case
and
the
jordan
decision
is
absolutely
controlling
of
the
issue
that's
before
this
court.
i'd
like
to
run
through
that
case.
there,
the
petitioner
had
been
convicted
of
an
attempted
robbery.
an
appeal
was
taken
from
the
conviction,
but
it
did
not
raise
the
point
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
a
speedy
trial
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
the
--
on
appeal,
the
--
the
conviction
was
affirmed,
and
certiorari
was
not
sought.
subsequently,
he
filed
a
motion
under
section
2255
claiming
that
his
constitutional
right
had
--
to
a
speedy
trial
had
been
denied
to
him.
the
court
of
appeals,
it
seems
to
us,
consistent
with
their
decision
in
this
hodges
case,
ruled
that
this
contention
of
lack
of
a
speedy
trial
could
not
be
raised
on
a
2255
motion,
since
it
could
have
been
but
was
not
raised
on
appeal.
and
certiorari
was
sought
on
this
precise
issue,
namely
whether
a
prisoner
is
entitled
to
a
2255
hearing,
solely
on
the
ground
that
his
conviction
was
constitutionally
invalid
because
he
had
been
denied
a
speedy
trial
despite
the
fact
that
he
could
have,
but
did
not
raise
the
point
on
appeal.
on
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
government
argued
that
this
was
the
type
of
claim
that
could
only
be
raised
on
appeal
and
that
there
was
not
a
type
of
error
which
could
be
made
the
basis
for
collateral
attack.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
it's
in
–-
mr.
quinn
o'connell
it
is
not
--
presumably,
it
had
not.
presumably,
it
had
not
and
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
that
if
i
might,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
--
i
will
say
that
it
had
not
been.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
the
court,
anyway,
rejected
this
argument
of
the
government
and
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
per
curiam,
sent
it
back
to
the
case
--
sent
the
case
back
for
determination
on
the
merits.
it
seems
to
us
in
the
essentials
that
these
two
cases,
the
hodges
and
the
jordan
cases
are
similar
and
i'll
get
back
to
your
distinction.
both
petitioners
claimed
that
their
convictions
were
based
upon
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right.
the
errors
claimed,
by
both,
were
correctible
on
appeal
that
neither
petitioner
raised
the
point
on
appeal,
but
both
later
sought
a
hearing
under
section
2255.
the
court
ruled
that
jordan
was
entitled
to
a
hearing,
but
in
the
hodges
case,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
hodges
was
not.
now,
it
seems
to
us,
actually,
that
there's
--
that
the
hodges
--
and
the
hodges
case
has
a
far
more
compelling
reason
than
the
--
in
the
jordan
case
because
the
--
in
jordan,
he
offered
no
reason
for
his
failure
to
raise
his
constitutional
objection
on
appeal,
whereas
in
hodges,
he
has
a
reason
which
for
all
practical
--
from
every
practical
standpoint
means
that
he
was
denied
the
opportunity
or
he
had
no
opportunity
to
appeal.
it's
interesting
to
--
to
note
that
in
the
jordan
--
that
the
government
before
the
court
of
appeals
despite
our
heavy
reliance
upon
this
did
not
mention
the
jordan
case.
the
court
of
appeals
also
did
not
mention
it
in
their
decision.
in
the
present
brief,
the
government
for
the
first
time
makes
the
mention
of
the
jordan
case
on
page
52
of
their
brief.
and
there,
they
treat
it
by
simply
brushing
it
aside
with
the
contention
that
the
claim
in
that
case,
lack
of
a
speedy
trial,
“could
be
deemed
to
vitiate
the
entire
trial,
and
in
that
sense
was
truly
jurisdictional.”
it
seems
to
us
that
by
this
language,
the
court
appears
to
be
attempting
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
seriousness
of
the
constitutional
right
claimed
that
have
been
denied
in
jordan
and
the
constitutional
right
claimed
that
have
been
denied
in
hodges.
the
implication
is
that
while
lack
of
a
speedy
trial
vitiates
the
trial,
the
use
of
a
coerced
confession
does
not,
but
this
is
completely
inconsistent
of
course
with
this
court's
many
pronouncements
to
the
effect
that
the
use
of
a
coerced
confession
in
a
trial
would
--
is
sufficient
to
void
the
trial.
and
actually,
the
government
itself
recognizes
elsewhere
in
the
brief
that
where
a
confession
is
in
fact
coerced
that
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
--
it's
undeniably
just
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
what
i
say
from
this
point
of
view,
that
the
government
makes
a
big
point
of
the
fact
that
here
there
was
a
determination
at
the
trial
of
this
particular
issue,
and
that
so
--
where
--
in
federal
courts,
you
get
one
effect
at
the
court
and
the
effect
that
they
would
have
to
have
a
rehearing,
the
same
court
would
have
to
have
a
rehearing
is
so
disorderly
a
process
that
there's
evidently
no
reason
for
--
for
going
into
this.
that
it
would
disrupt
the
orderliness
of
the
administration
of
criminal
law
to
have
the
same
court
rehear
the
question
a
second
time
in
order
that
the
appel
--
the
person
who
would
obtain
an
appellate
review
of
this
basic
error.
and
we
say
that
this
would
only
be
--
this
is
only
available,
of
course,
where
there
has
been
such
a
basic
error
that
it
would
vitiate
the
conviction
and
vitiate
the
trial
where
the
trial
was
not
fair.
and
certainly,
if
the
coerced
confess
--
if
it
was
a
coerced
confession
that
was
used
to
obtain
his
conviction,
that
is
such
a
basic
error
that
it
would
make
the
trial
a
mere
pretense.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
certainly
2255
itself
provides
a
successive
motions
to
deny
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well
--
well,
he
could
--
at
some
later
date,
if
he
files
a
motion
under
2255,
claiming
that
his
conviction
was
based
upon
a
constitution
deprivation
of
his
rights,
well
certainly
--
unless
as
--
as
the
statute
says,
unless
the
records
and
the
motion
inclusively
show
there's
no
merit
to
this
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
yes.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
oh,
the
broad
position
we
take
is
exactly
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
but
the
narrower
position
we
take
is
that
if
--
if
there
--
if
there
is
to
be
a
limitation
so
that
this
cannot
--
a
person
cannot,
not
--
can
fail
to
appeal
and
then
later
on
raise
this
issue
at
any
time,
that
this
court
may
wish
to
place
a
limitation
as
judge
fahy
wanted
to
place
a
limitation
on
it
to
the
effect
that
if
there
has
--
if
there
is
a
reasonable
excuse,
which
he
would
have
to
show
to
the
court,
for
the
--
for
not
appealing
from
the
conviction,
then
that
--
if
he
is
justified
in
not
appealing,
and
this
is
such
an
exceptional
circumstance
as
the
court
mentioned
in
bowen
v.
johnson
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
collateral
remedy
would
be
available
to
him.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
no.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
say
this
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
judge
washington
specifically
stated
that
his
opinion
was
based
upon
he
says,
“assuming
arguendo
that
this
constituted
excusable
neglect.”
he
assumed
that
this
was
a
justifiable
reason
for
not
appealing,
that's
at
page
151
of
the
record,
but
what
he
did
was
strangely
enough,
it
seems
to
us,
was
to
rely
upon
this
court‘s
decision
in
robinson
against
the
united
states
--
united
states
against
robinson
where
the
court
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
whether
the
10-day
appeal
period
was
jurisdictional
or
not.
and
the
court
here
decided
that
it
was
jurisdictional
and
after
the
10-day
period
was
a
--
for
appeal
had
--
had
expired
that
his
person's
rights
for
an
appeal
were
absolutely
foreclosed,
but
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
yes.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
in
other
words,
once
you
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
exactly
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
exactly
what
--
what
judge
fahy
he
said
that
where
--
where
there
has
been
a
--
there's
a
justifiable
excuse
for
not
appealing
coupled
with
a
--
a
basic
constitutional
error
that
is
being
claimed
on
the
merits
that
in
those
cases,
both
of
those
questions,
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
judge
washington.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
yes,
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
i
do
not
--
i
don't
understand
judge
washington
to
have
passed
on
the
merits
of
the
--
of
the
claim
at
all.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
i
do
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
i
do
not
understand
that.
it's
my
--
it's
my
understanding
of
the
opinion
that
this
--
that
that
--
that
the
merits
of
the
--
of
the
claim
were
not
gone
into
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
--
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
those
merits.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
actually,
judge
washington
relied
upon
the
robinson
case
here
to
deny
the
2255
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
and
he
seemed
to
equate
the
remedy
that
is
available
in
--
available
on
appeal
with
the
remedy
that's
available
on
2255.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
and
he
has
a
reason
for
not
appealing.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
exactly
--
that's
exactly
the
distinction
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
yes,
i
do.
i
agree
that
that
is
the
--
the
interpretation
of
the
--
judge
--
what
judge
washington
held
and
what
judge
fahy
held.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
--
this
is
a
--
i'm
--
the
--
the
main
point
that
i'm
trying
to
--
to
urge
here
is
that
judge
fahy's
opinion
is
absolutely
right.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
there's
absolutely
nothing
your
honor.
the
--
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus
and
the
scope
of
2255
as
this
court
has
discussed
in
the
united
states
against
hayman
are
exactly
the
same.
but
as
pointed
out
in
the
robinson
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
it's
--
i
would
say
that
it
should
although
if
the
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
it's
my
understanding
that
--
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
concerning
habeas
corpus
and
2255
are
that
the
scope
of
review
on
habeas
corpus
or
2255
is
very
narrow.
it's
a
very
narrow
scope
of
review
and
it
has
to
be
--
it
is
directed
to
whether
or
not
the
conviction
itself
is
completely
vitiated
because
of
a
real
basic
denial
of
a
--
of
a
constitutional
right,
whereas
the
scope
of
review
on
appeal
is
as
broad
as
the
record
itself.
you
can
--
you
can
raise
errors
of
law
that
have
occurred.
you
can
raise
all
kinds
of
--
of
any
errors
as
part
of
the
district
court,
which
don't
go
to
the
real
constitutional
issues,
but
which
on
appeal
would
allow
a
reversal
in
those
circumstances.
now,
as
judge
fahy
pointed
out,
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
an
attempt
to
appeal
out
of
time
because
of
excusable
neglect.
we
are
concerned
here
with
collateral
challenge
to
a
sentence,
the
time
limitation
for
appeal
is
rigid
and
jurisdictional,
but
the
scope
of
review
is
as
broad
as
the
record
itself.
in
contrast,
there
is
no
time
limitation
applicable
to
a
section
2255
motion,
but
the
scope
of
review
is
narrow.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
there
was
a
hearing.
what
transpired
at
that
hearing,
i
do
not
know.
the
district
court
judge
issued
an
opinion,
made
findings
of
fact,
and
a
conclusion
of
law
after
a
hearing
which
--
which
he
says
that
--
this
is
on
page
6
of
the
record,
he
said,
“an
oral
hearing
was
held
on
october
25,
1957
with
counsel
on
both
sides
present.”
mr.
quinn
o'connell
and
in
that
--
and
at
that
hearing,
he
decided
that,
and
according
to
the
government,
it's
presumably
on
the
basis
of
his
recollection
of
what
happened
at
the
trial,
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i'm
not
--
all
i
want
him
to
--
what
i
would
like
to
have
is
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
review
this
--
to
review
the
merits
of
this
decision
here.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
in
sunal
though,
the
claim
was
not
a
basic
error.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
that
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
in
all
of
these
cases
on
collateral
remedies
that
there
have
been
these
distinctions
made
between
mere
errors
of
law
and
fundamental
error.
what
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
in
the
robinson
case,
for
example,
where
they
held
that
an
appeal
couldn't
lie
because
2255
--
because
the
10-day
appeal
period
has
expired
and
there
--
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
excuse
was
justifiable.
the
court
noted
and
i
--
and
it
seems
to
me
relied
partially
on
the
fact
that
this
was
not
that
harsh
determination
because
--
and
i
quote
from
the
court's
opinion,
“the
allowance
of
an
appeal
months
or
years
after
expiration
of
the
prescribed
time
seems
unnecessary
for
the
accomplishment
of
substantial
justice,
for
there
are
a
number
of
collateral
remedies
available
to
redress
denial
of
basic
rights.
examples
are
and
skipping
“the
power
of
a
district
court
to
entertain
a
collateral
attack
upon
a
judgment
of
conviction
and
to
vacate,
set
aside
or
correct
the
sentence
under
28
u.s.c.
2255.”
it
seems
to
me,
to
deny
a
hearing
to
the
hodges
where
he
has
a
basic
error
that
you're
denying
the
promise
that
was
--
of
robinson
where
they
said
that
of
course
you
cannot
appeal
after
the
10-day
period.
but
if
it's
--
if
there
are
--
there
are
collateral
remedies
available
where
there
are
basic
rights
denied.
here,
we
now
only
have
a
basic
right
but
we
have
an
excuse
for
not
appealing
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
these
circumstances
that
if
the
purpose
of
collateral
remedy
is
to
do
substantial
justice
that
any
limitation
upon
this
for
--
in
this
case
would
defeat
that
purpose.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
the
bowen
v.
johnson
case,
as
i
recall,
was
a
--
was
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
and
whereas
they
denied
the
writ,
they
denied
it
on
the
merits
of
the
claim.
they
didn't
say
that
he
wasn't
entitled
to
have
the
--
the
particular
question
involved
even
though
there
had
been
no
appeal.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
in
the
jordan
case
which
was
2255,
i
think
there's
no
distinction
between
habeas
corpus
and
2255,
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right
and
in
here
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
we
are
not
asserting
here
that
he
has
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
but
he
is
not
going
to
have
a
right
to
appeal
on
the
other
errors.
there
may
have
been
a
lot
of
errors
at
this
trial
court
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
--
and
he's
not
going
to
have
those
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
those
are
forever
foreclosed,
your
honor,
under
robinson.
but
this
is
a
basic
denial
of
a
(inaudible)
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
there
would
be
appeal
from
the
--
from
the
instructions
of
the
--
of
the
jury
or
--
i
mean
there
may
have
been
other
--
other
errors.
i'd
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
think
there
are
certain
things
that
we
ought
to
get
straight
as
to
what
is
not
in
dispute
here.
it
is
not
in
dispute
that
the
petitioner
did,
in
his
petition
under
section
2255,
claim
that
his
confession
was
admitted
in
evidence
at
his
trial
and
used
against
him
over
the
objection
of
trial
counsel
and
that
the
rights
of
the
defendant
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
were
clearly
violated
by
the
above
described
procedure
that
being
part
of
the
procedure.
he
did
raise
certain
mcnabb
and
mallory
questions,
but
he
--
the
point
is
that
he
did
specifically
allege
that
this
confession
was
--
should
not
have
been
admitted
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
district
court
on
its
hearing
and
whatever
basis
it
arrived
in
its
decision,
we
do
not
know
because
there
is
no
transcript
of
that
--
of
that
proceeding,
held
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
we
don't
know
the
basis
for
this
decision
in
that
matter.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
review
this
decision,
and
this
is
the
decision
that
we
say
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
judicial
determination
of,
was
if
an
error
as
a
matter
of
law
to
have
submitted
this
confession
to
the
jury.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
the
court
of
appeals
has
had
the
trial
record
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
both
times.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that
is
right.
that
was
the
only
record
it
had
had.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
disagree
from
this
point
of
view
your
honor
that
judge
fahy
also
wrote
the
dissent
and
judge
fahy
wrote
this
opinion
and
judge
fahy
in
his
dissent
seems
to
believe
that
this
person
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
this
question.
so
i
don't
believe
that
judge
fahy
could
have
meant
that
he
had
reviewed
the
record.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
think
it's
a
pure
conjecture
as
to
what
he
means
in
that
regard
as
to
whether
or
not,
he
reviewed
the
merits
or
not
and
i
think
it's
unfortunate
that
we
have
to
have
this
conjecture
on
the
merits.
the
--
we
say
that
the
transcript
of
trial
does
show
as
a
matter
of
law
that
this
confession
was
erroneously
admitted.
the
government
says
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
wasn't
erroneously
admitted.
all
we
say
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
judicial
determination
of
this
matter
which
we
haven't
received
as
yet
properly.
we
also
--
pardon?
mr.
quinn
o'connell
we
say
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
there
was
a
judicial
determination
at
the
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
we're
entitled
to
a
judicial
--
judicial
determination
which
may
be
based
upon
the
trial
record
on
this
single
small
point
which
is
a
point
which
--
in
which
we
claim
the
denial
of
basic
rights.
and
we
claim
that
we're
entitled
to
that
because
there
was
a
--
there
was
justifiable
excuse
for
the
failure
of
this
petitioner
to
appeal
from
his
conviction
and
this
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
it
would
not
necessarily
be
a
second
evidentiary
hearing.
the
court
could
determine
this
on
the
trial
transcript
and
obviously
it
would
require
a
rehearing
by
the
same
court
that
decided
it
in
order
to
get
an
appellant
review
of
this
decision.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
they
can
do
it
on
the
--
they
can
do
it,
but
they
didn't
do
it.
that's
all
we
want.
we
want
a
review
of
this
district
court's
determination
that
it
was
voluntary.
we
don't
know
what
they
base
that
on,
but
the
record
before
the
court
of
appeals
wasn't
only
the
trial
transcript
and
we
say
on
the
basis
of
that
trial
transcript
that
if
the
court
had
examined
the
trial
transcript
and
decided
the
merits
of
this
person's
--
of
this
petitioner's
claim
which
they
didn't
do.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
would
say
that
you're
not
barred
from
doing
it
although
i
wish
that
we
had
argued
in
brief
more
thoroughly
in
this
court
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
it's
a
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
think
it
would
be
more
orderly
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
able
to
determine
that
issue.
they
decided
that
they
didn't
have
a
right
there.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
no,
on
the
face
--
but
i
think
that
it
does
require
an
analysis
of
the
entire
trial
transcript
from
--
with
from
this
point
of
view.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
and
also,
i
think
that
on
the
other
point
that
we're
entitled
to
a
hearing
on,
if
there
is
confusion
on
the
point
that
is
whether
or
not
this
was
excusable
neglect.
if
this
is
not
acceptable
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
then
we
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
that
and
that's
all
we're
seeking
here
is
a
judicial
determination
of
(a)
was
this
excusable
neglect
in
failing
to
appeal,
and
(b)
if
it
was,
was
this
a
matter
--
an
error
as
a
matter
of
law
to
have
admitted
this
confession
into
evidence.
the
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right,
but
the
way
this
came
up
your
honor
is
this,
the
appeal
was
noted
from
the
denial
of
2255
hearing.
at
the
time
of
the
--
well,
there
was
a
brief
filed
and
it
was
vacated
and
counsel
was
dismissed.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
yes.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
alright.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
i
think
that's
as
precise
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
the
affidavits
are
there
before
us.
of
course
they
have
not
been
(voice
overlap)
--
the
government
has
not
rebutted
or
anything.
i
mean
they
had
another
hearing
in
which
they
rebut.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
yes,
because
we
don't
know
whether
this
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
the
reason
that
it's
unusual
your
honor
though
is
that
there
is
no
transcript.
the
record
--
that
this
is
really
subject
to
appeal
is
just
gone.
there
isn't
any
record
of
this
2255
hearing.
i
would
assume
that
this
would
have
been
a
proper
thing
that
would
have
come
up
at
the
2255
hearing.
why
didn't
the
fellow
appeal?
i
don't
know
what
happened
at
the
2255
hearing,
but
it
seems
that
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
because
of
this
lack
of
a
transcript
of
the
hearing
which
has
ultimately
come
to
the
supreme
court
that
because
we
don't
know
that
he
should
be
deprived
of
any
opportunity
to
explain
his
reasons.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that
neglect
to
appeal?
mr.
quinn
o'connell
it's
never
--
no
matter
--
whether
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
believe
it
does
your
honor,
but
the
point
is
this.
the
government
itself
concedes
that
there
--
that
there
are
hypothetical
cases
which
they
can
conceive
where
the
failure
to
appeal
might
be
such
that
it
would
not
bar
a
collateral
attack
and
they
mentioned
such
cases
as
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
no,
we're
not
to
decide
those
hypothetical
cases
your
honor,
but
all
i
am
saying
that
as
a
practical
matter,
effectively,
those
hypothetical
cases
so
far
as
our
petitioner
is
concerned,
his
excuses
is
just
as
great
as
those
hypothetical
cases
if
he
didn't
know
of
his
rights
to
appeal.
if
a
person
comes
to
sentence
under
37
(a)
(2),
rule
37
(a)
(2)
without
an
attorney,
the
district
court
judge
is
obliged
to
inform
him
of
his
appellate
rights
and
have
the
clerk
of
the
court
note
the
appeal
for
him.
in
effect,
this
petitioner
was
in
no
different
position
than
a
person
who
had
actually
attended
the
sentencing
without
a
hearing.
and
this,
as
a
practical
matter,
this
whole
thing
could
be
avoided
by
the
very
simple
thing
of
having
37
(a)
(2)
applied
no
matter
whether
counsel
is
present
or
not
because
this
is
a
--
this
10-day
appeal
period
is
evidently
caused
--
causes
a
lot
of
trouble
where
counsel
who
have
either
appointed
by
the
court
or
who
is
representing
a
person
without
a
fee
after
sentencing,
they've
gone
through
the
trial
and
they
leave.
i
mean
they
just
feel
that
their
responsibilities
are
over
evidently
but
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
no,
no.
under
37
(a)
(2)
now,
the
court
does
have
a
duty
if
the
person
doesn't
have
counsel
to
tell
him
of
his
appellate
rights
and
he
has
a
right
to
appeal
and
the
time
length.
and
if
he
has
requested
then
as
a
result
of
telling
this
person,
if
the
petitioner
--
if
the
person
requests
the
court
that
he
does
want
to
appeal,
the
court
is
required
to
have
the
clerk
of
the
court
note
the
appeal
for
the
prisoner.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
it
certainly
would
avoid
this
situation
where
a
person
who
had
counsel
was
not
told
of
his
rights
to
appeal.
he
had
been
better
of
if
he
hadn't
--
if
he'd
appeared
with
sentencing
without
counsel.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
yes,
i
did.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
the
only
thing
that
might
be
considered
a
pleading
is
the
attempt
to
supplement
the
record
with
these
affidavits.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
oh,
after
this
opinion,
nothing
has
been
done.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
yes.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
the
affidavits
of
the
counsel
showing
the
reasons
for
excusing
to
appeal.
judge
fahy's
panel
did
not
have
that
before
it.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that
is
correct.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right.
and
i
say
--
and
i
agree
that
it's
an
unsatisfactory
record.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right,
because
judge
fahy's
opinion
for
the
panel
said,
based
his
opinion
on
the
fact
that
there
had
been
no
reason
even
offered
for
failing
to
appeal.
and
this
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
--
a
reason
had
been
offered
prior
to
that
but
a
different
panel
had
rejected
the
offer
to
supplement
the
record
and
when
it
was
brought
out
to
the
court
that
they
were
actually
were
reasons
for
failing
to
appeal,
these
affidavits
were
not
filed
after
the
--
judge
fahy's
opinion.
they
had
been
prepared
and
a
motion
to
supplement
the
record
had
been
made
when
the
case
first
went
up
before
it
was
briefed.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
because
a
different
penal
of
the
court
in
acting
upon
the
motion
to
supplement
the
record
before
the
panel
had
even
been
picked
to
hear
the
case
on
the
merits
had
--
with
the
per
curiam
order
refused
to
allow
the
affidavits
into
the
record.
then
judge
fahy,
he
decided
the
case
on
the
ground
that
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
show
why
this
appeal
had
not
been
taken.
well,
an
attempt
had
been
made
but
had
been
rejected
by
different
panel
and
this
is
what
we
pointed
out
on
the
hearing.
then
judge
fahy
came
around
to
the
point
where
he
said,
“well,
if
i
had
known
that
and
now
i
do
know
it,
then
he
has
a
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
affidavits
are
true,”
and
if
they
are
true
then
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
new
grounds
your
honor
from
this
point
of
view.
at
the
trial,
there
was
objection
that
this
was
--
this
should
not
have
been
admitted
into
evidence
that
it
should
not
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
in
his
petition
for
--
under
2255,
he
claim
that
his
constitutional
rights
were
denied
by
admitting
these
things
into
evidence
and
that's
--
that's
the
whole
issue
here.
but
do
we
reach
it?
does
he
get
it
--?
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
i
don't
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
i
am
all
for
the
prompt
disposition
of
this
case,
your
honor.
but
all
i
say
is
that
i
--
unfortunately,
we
felt
that
the
issue
on
certiorari
was
based
upon
the
issues
that
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that's
the
issue
we've
tried
to
present
it.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
at
least
that
--
it's
that
great
big
issue
that
we
were
here
trying
to
decide
--
have
you
people
decide,
and
unfortunately,
we
have
not
briefed
the
other
issue
on
the
merits
and
we
feel
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right.
that's
the
precise
issue
here
i
believe.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
this
is
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
this
was
not
a
district
court
judge.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
pardon
me?
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well
your
honor,
i
know
why
it
wasn't
argued
before
that
panel
because
i
argued
the
case
and
it
wasn't
argued
before
the
panel
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
told
me
that
they
would
not
allow
this
in
the
record
and
this
--
if
there's
an
error
that's
an
error
of
the
counsel.
mr.
quinn
o'connell
well,
it's
the
same
court
speaking
to
a
lawyer
and
i
just
--
whatever
the
panel
speaks
to
me
--
mr.
quinn
o'connell
thank
you.
it's
been
a
privilege
your
honor.
