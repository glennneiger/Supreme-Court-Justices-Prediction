had
there
been
witnesses
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
see
how
you
can
tell
us
that
the
court
decided
that
there
has
been
no
appeal,
there
can
be
no
collateral
attack
ever
based
on
a
--
on
a
claim
of
a
coerced
confession
because
--
i'm
referring
now
to
the
opinion
written
by
judge
washington
and
that's
the
one
to
which
you
are
referring,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
judge
washington,
i
assume,
would
think
that
the
admission
into
evidence
of
a
--
of
a
coerced
confession
would
be
the
denial
of
a
basic
right
and
yet,
he
characterizes
this
case,
on
page
152,
as
one
where
no
basic
right
has
been
denied.
it's
about
--
very
close
to
the
end
of
his
opinion
on
page
152
of
the
record
and
so,
wouldn't
--
and
that
at
least
indicate
that
judge
washington
saw
this
case
before
him
a
little
bit
more
the
way
the
government
sees
the
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
was
in
the
black
and
white
terms
in
which
you're
posing
it
to
us?
justice
potter
stewart
well
and
also
didn't
--
did
he
not
have
a
hearing
of
this
whole
matter
represented
by
counsel
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
trial
court?
you're
putting
us
the
case,
the
raw
black
and
white
case
of
where
an
admittedly
coerced
confession
was
admitted
at
the
trial
in
a
criminal
case
to
convict
the
defendant.
now,
that
obviously
would
be
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
and
i
--
i
think
we
can
fairly
assume
that
judge
washington
would
appreciate
that.
he
characterized
on
the
other
hand
--
he
characterized
this
case
as
--
as
a
case
where
no
basic
right
was
denied.
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
the
--
my
difficulties
and
i
think
you
understand
why
is
because
in
your
briefs,
you
and
the
government
just
don't
seem
to
agree
what
the
questions
are
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
also
further
points
out
that
this
whole
issue
was
--
was
--
was
tried
out
at
the
--
at
the
original
criminal
trial
when
hodges
was
represented
by
a
counsel.
and
the
court,
after
hearing
all
the
evidence,
decided
that
this
was
a
--
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
coercion
--
the
confession
was
coerced
was
a
matter
for
the
jury
to
determine,
and
that
hodges
neither
now
nor
any
--
at
any
other
time,
objected
to
the
instructions
under
which
that
issue
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wouldn't
have
been
--
that
would
have
been
constituted
a
very
good
point
even
on
a
direct
appeal,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
were
you're
saying
ms.
rosenberg
if
in
this
case,
the
federal
district
judge
had
applied
erroneous
standards,
had
applied
the
standards
which
the
trial
court
applied
in
--
and
perhaps
the
higher
court
in
connecticut
applied
in
rogers
against
richmond?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
general
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
you're
making
a
general
argument
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
the
same
rules
shouldn't
apply
to
a
federal
trial
as
to
a
state
trial
and
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
generality
of
that
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
doesn't
the
district
judge
at
the
very
conclusion
of
his
conclusions
of
law
hold
as
an
alternative
ground
for
his
denial
of
relief
under
2255
that
this
matter
could
have
been
urged
on
the
upon
direct
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
expressly
refer
to
the
rogers
against
richmond
standard
for
instance.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
hypothetical
case
from
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
ms.
rosenberg,
while
we're
still
back
tracking,
you
mentioned
the
name
of
another
case
that
you
said
involved
a
related
problem
in
which
i
had
the
impression
you
told
us
that
we've
granted
certiorari,
lampe
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
did
have
before
it
the
first
time
at
least
the
trial
record,
did
it
nit?
justice
potter
stewart
both
times?
justice
potter
stewart
both
on
the
re
--
and
again,
on
the
rehearing
--
