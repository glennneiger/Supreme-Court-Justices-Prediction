justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
she
had
hired
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
affidavit
said
that
they
--
that
represented
him
without
a
fee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
of
what
you've
just
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
i
didn't
--
the
distinction
between
what
judge
fahy
wrote
and
what
judge
washington
wrote.
as
i
understand
judge
fahy,
he
accepted
the
robinson
case
with
the
meaning
that
you
had
to
appeal
within
10
days?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
a
right
--
the
proper
way
to
challenge
a
wrongful
finding
on
a
confession
was
by
an
appeal.
then
he
went
on
to
say,
as
i
understand
it,
that
here,
this
man
alleged
that
there
were
excusable
grounds
for
his
not
having
appealed.
there
was
a
good
reason
for
his
not
having
appealed.
and
as
i
understand
judge
fahy's
opinion,
he
said,
“accepting
the
fact
that
a
man
has
barred
from
challenging
his
confession
in
an
appellate
court
by
failing
to
appeal
within
10
days,
if
he
showed
a
good
reason
why
he
did
not
take
the
appeal,”
and
he
described
good
reasons
in
several
ways,
“then
that
justifies
him
in
attacking
it
collaterally
by
2255
proceedings.”
are
you
--
do
you
necessarily
have
to
go
beyond
that
in
your
argument
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
the
other
opinion,
the
court's
opinion,
they
said,
“without
regard
or
excusable
reason,
he
could
not
attack
it
under
2255.”
and
as
i
understand
judge
fahy,
his
argument
was
the
line
at
which
it
relates
to
a
question
that
chief
justice
asked
you,
i
maybe
wrong
about
it
and
i'm
asking
you
to
explain
it
and
if
i'm
wrong,
that
this
man
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
his
statement
that
there
was
a
good
reason
for
his
appeal,
he
should
not
be
held
to
it.
therefore,
he
should
be
allowed
to
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
confession
in
this
proceeding
since
he
had
been
cut
off
from
it
because
his
appeal
was
not
taken
when
he
had
good
reason
for
not
taking
it.
that's
what
i
understood
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
judge
fahy
wanted
to
have
tried
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
that
is
the
issue,
then
it
seem
to
me
from
the
two
that
the
difference
between
judge
fahy
and
judge
burger,
i
believe
it
was
judge
burger.
justice
hugo
l.
black
washington
--
was
that
judge
washington
said
--
assuming
that
he
said
here,
there
is
no
basic
constitutional
right
has
been
affected
that
he
was
then
passing
on
this
record
as
it
was,
if
--
if
that
was
the
case
and
he
would
pass
on
that,
i
would
think
maybe
it
would
undercut
judge
fahy's
dissent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
so
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
--
of
the
basic
claim
of
a
fundamental
error
in
that
he
was
convicted
on
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
do
you
understand
that
he
looked
at
the
record
to
see
whether
or
not
there
had
been
such
a
denial
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
records
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
that
judge
fahy's
opinion
--
dissent,
based
on
the
premise
that
one
hearing
by
an
appellate
court
would
be
enough
and
that
he
was
not
taking
a
position
to
be
repeated
(inaudible),
maybe
i'm
wrong
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
he
was
saying
that
he'd
only
--
he'd
only
have
one
hearing,
and
the
reason
he
only
had
one
was
because
for
a
good
reason,
he
had
not
appealed,
so
as
to
follow
up
the
jurisdictional
requirements,
to
have
it
reviewed
on
appeal,
since
that
was
not
the
case,
there
should
be
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
that
was
a
good
reason.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
was
the
difference
in
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
dispute
between
them.
as
i
understand,
once
--
judge
washington
seemingly
to
say
that
since
he
was
cut
off
from
an
appeal,
that
ended
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--judge
fayh
took
the
position
with
reference
to
a
fundamental
error
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

constitutional
right,
while
he
had
failed
to
appeal
for
a
good
reason,
that
2255
was
open
to
him,
just
as
he
referred
to
the
reopening
of
a
whole
situation
by
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
are
urging
that
we
even
go
further
than
judge
fahy
had?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
simple
issue
was
all
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals,
why
did
they
write
these
different
opinions
on
the
legal
point
that
was
raised
when
they
could
have
very
easily
said
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
is
merely
a
question.
we've
looked
at
the
record
and
there
was
nothing
raised
except
the
question
of
credibility
and
jury
decided
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
because
--
do
you
thought
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
motion
made
by
the
defendant's
new
counsel
which
appears
on
page
12,
13
and
so
forth
that
they
pointed
out
that
as
to
looking
up
the
record,
they
had
found
that
the
appellate
had
never
been
informed
and
was
unaware
of
his
right
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
from
his
conviction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
in
defending
this
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
record
refused
the
charges
that
this
man
has
made,
that
he's
been
given
a
hearing
on
those
charges
or
is
it
without
committing
at
all
the
basis
on
which
judge
washington
decided,
namely
that
here,
that
the
only
claim
is
excusable
neglect
and
that
excusable
neglect
cannot
be
raised
because
there
was
no
appeal
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
insofar
as
they
can
make
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
did
the
court
consider
that
point
at
all?
if
so,
what
part
of
its
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
might
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
defend
on
the
ground
that
he
hadn't
made
out
a
case
did
it,
except
to
the
extent
that
he
hadn't
made
out
a
case
because
he
alleged
that
the
confession
was
coerced
and
he
had
not
appealed
within
10
days
and
therefore
he
was
barred
under
2255
proceeding?

what
has

what
has
the

held?

the

--
justice

(inaudible)
no
hearing
in
judge
(inaudible)
justice

--
fahy's
position
was
that
there
should
be
a
hearing
on
the
section
raised
though?
justice

black
but
he
took
this
claim
(inaudible),
didn't
he?
he
said,
“but
mere
neglect
in
taking
an
appeal
--
excusable
or
not
--
should
not
open
the
door
to
the
bringing
of
collateral
attack
under
section
2255.”
justice

l.
black
and
think
that
would
not
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
district
court,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
district
court,
maybe
in
some
other
statement,
i
don't
know,
the
district
court's
reason
was
that
there
had
been
no
constitutional
question
raised
in
the
2255
procedure
but
only
the
mcnabb
and
mallory
ruling
which
did
not
rise
to
a
constitutional
level
and
that
therefore
--
and
that
therefore,
2255
was
not
the
proper
remedy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
referring
to
what
he
held
on
exclusion
of
law
on
page
8.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
he
passed
on.
that's
why
he
denied
the
2255
hearing,
wasn't
it?
that
it
was
not
a
constitutional
point.
and
when
it
got
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
maybe
it
was
wrong,
but
in
someway,
they
came
and
challenged
it
up
there
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
he's
been
denied
of
the
rights
--
a
constitutional
right,
violate
his
constitutional
rights
and
the
majority
said
that
made
no
difference.
they
treat
it
as
it
though
that
was
a
proper
place
to
do
it.
but
they
said
that
made
no
difference
because
they
--
since
he
had
not
appealed
his
rights
were
cut
off.
when
judge
(inaudible),
judge
fahy
took
the
position
that
that
was
not
correct,
that
these
thing
did
raise
questions
of
fact
that
should
be
tried
out
by
the
district
judge
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
good
reason
why
he
had
not
appealed,
and
if
so,
that
he
should
have
a
right
to
challenge,
to
raise
his
constitutional
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
raising
--
are
you
raising
this
question
that
what
they
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
what
was
passed
on
there,
was
not
properly
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying
that
even
conceding
that
he
properly
challenges
the
coercion
--
that
confession
has
having
been
coerced
and
then
said
that
he
wanted
to
appeal
it
but
he
had
a
good
reason
not
to
do
so
on
the
grave,
had
a
good
reason
not
to
do
so,
he
was
now
raising
and
seeking
(inaudible)
on
whether
he
had
a
good
reason
for
not
having
appeal
that
still
it
was
(inaudible)
for
the
supreme
court
to
decide
it
on
the
narrow
question
of
which
i
don't
quite
--
but
some
narrow
question
and
that
one
which
was
properly
before
them,
and
which
they
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
want
it
to
decide
on
the
question
of
pleadings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
is
the
government's
position
if
--
if
your
view
should
be
taken,
that
he
didn't
allege
it
right,
that
if
he's
denied
to
right
to
a
hearing
here,
would
that
bar
him
from
asking
the
2255
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
point
--
on
the
point
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me.
just
one
of
the
thing
in
section
5
of
his
complaint,
“alleged
that
the
defendant
was
held
without
a
warrant
for
five
days
by
the
chicago
police
acting
with
the
knowledge
(inaudible)
washington
police
during
which
time
he
was
questioned
continually
and
beaten
physically,
subjected
to
psychological
as
well
as
physical
torture,
was
the
result
that
he
made
a
statement
demanded
by
the
chicago
police
(inaudible)
are
you
saying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
saying
that
his
allegation
is
not
true.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
where
do
you
find
the
support
for
your
statement
that
he
is
claiming
that
he
ought
to
be
turned
lose
because
the
jury
decided
contrary
to
his
evidence
in
favor
of
the
government's
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
to
get
myself
absolutely
clear.
i'm
not
clear.
what
i'm
asking
you
especially
for
is
not
to
discuss
the
merits
and
being
implied
on
the
merits
because
i
want
to
see
if
i'm
right
as
to
what
happens.
first,
judge
fahy
wrote
an
opinion
for
the
court
on
the
record
as
it
then
stood
in
which
he
did
say
that
the
man
was
not
entitled
to
a
hearing.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
a
motion
for
rehearing
was
made.
the
defendant
asked
for
--
to
supplement
the
record
and
raised
for
the
first
time
clearly
as
i
gather
from
judge
fahy's
second
opinion,
the
question
that
had
been
a
good
excuse
on
his
--
from
his
standpoint
and
failing
to
appeal,
is
that
right?
did
the
supplemental
motion
with
affidavits
attached
raised
a
new
or
supplement
and
strengthen
the
claim
that
there
had
been
a
reasonable
excuse
--
a
good
excuse
for
not
appealing
if
such
an
excuse
could
justify
anything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
let
me
ask
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
the
question
that
it
clarifies
to
me
and
then
you
can
bring
it
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
judge
fahy
said
the
papers
filed
with
that
motion
relied
upon
--
include
affidavits,
this
state
in
substance
and
after
he
was
sentenced
argued
--
it
was
promptly
taken
away
and
so
forth
without
opportunity
of
this
counsel
to
advice
him
and
to
get
his
appeal.
now,
did
he
on
the
basis
of
this
new
--
these
new
facts
which
he
said
appeared
in
this
motion
say
that
this
change
of
situation
told
that
it
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
if
the
--
if
the
failure
to
appeal
was
justifiable
and
it
raised
the
constitutional
question,
the
court
should
have
a
hearing
to
determine
in
this
instance
first,
was
the
failure
to
appeal
a
good
reason
so
as
to
say
that
this
now
could
be
raised
on
a
2255
motion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
those
--
those
papers
are
here
before
us
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
you've
stated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
are
insisting
that
judge
fahy's
view
as
to
the
fact
of
excusable
neglect
in
an
appeal
can
be
raised
in
connection
with
a
2255
motion
to
the
extent
that
if
there
was
an
excusable
neglect
or
whatever
the
court
found
that
to
be
insofar
as
the
2255
motion
is
concerned
and
substantial
constitutional
questions
are
raised,
that
that
put
him
--
entitled
him
through
a
hearing
on
the
facts
alleged
in
the
new
motion
before
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
rather
unusual
method
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
if
judge
fahy
is
wrong
in
the
basic
premise
on
which
he
wrote
that
neglect
to
appeal
will
bar
a
2255
proceeding
just
as
it
barred
the
appeal
then
your
position
would
not
be
sound,
would
it,
if
he
is
wrong
in
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
in
that
neglect
to
appeal
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
excusable
--
whether
it's
excusable
or
unexcused,
the
neglect
to
appeal
no
more
grants
a
right,
have
the
question
reviewed
on
2255
than
it
would
on
direct
appeal.
if
you
are
wrong
--
if
he's
wrong
in
that,
it
ends
your
contention
here,
does
it
or
does
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
found
the
issue
that
judge
fahy
suggests
which
i
agree.
what
we
would
say
was
this,
whether
the
record
as
it
is
with
the
supplement
that
judge
fahy
was
unaware
off
when
he
wrote
second
opinion,
sufficient
to
justify
the
findings
that
there
was
an
excuse
of
the
delay
and
then
that
forces
us,
does
it
not,
to
reach
the
question
is
to
whether
an
excusable
delay
even
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
2255
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
on
the
fact
that
judge
fahy
is
a
very
competent
judge.
he
said
this,
in
his
petition
for
rehearing,
hodges
brings
to
our
attention
that
in
earlier
proceedings
in
this
court,
he
sought
to
supplement
the
record
on
appeal
to
show
why
he
had
failed
to
appeal
(inaudible).
the
significance
of
this
showing
was
not
urged
in
briefs
and
arguments.
the
hearing
was
led
to
the
opinion
of
december
30th,
1959.
that's
the
one
judge
fahy
had
previously
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
doubt
because
another
division
of
our
court
has
denied
the
motion
to
supplement
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
