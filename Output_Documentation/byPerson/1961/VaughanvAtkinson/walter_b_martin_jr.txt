mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
seaman
in
this
case
was
not
a
professional
seaman.
the
only
four
months
he
had
ever
been
to
sea
as
a
seaman
was
on
the
vessel
national
liberty.
it's
been
a
good
part
of
his
life
prior
to
world
war
ii
and
for
some
12
or
13
years
after
world
ward
ii
as
a
taxicab
driver.
for
some
unknown
reason,
he
decided
to
go
to
sea
for
two
voyages.
he
left
the
national
liberty,
not
on
account
of
illness,
but
he
left
at
the
end
of
a
voyage
when
the
entire
crew
signed
off
articles.
at
that
time,
he
did
request
a
slip
of
the
master
to
permit
him
to
go
to
the
public
health
hospital.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
terms
of
his
employment
were
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
--
to
a
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
--
port
of
europe
and
returned
to
the
united
states.
they
were
the
ordinary
coast
guard
forum
articles
on
the
united
states
merchant
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
and
he
signed
off
before
the
shipping
commissioner
with
the
rest
of
the
crew,
the
normal
termination
of
the
voyage.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
i
think
it
does
if
we
are
going
to
rely
upon
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
sobeloff.
and
i
will
get
to
that
later,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
i
was
merely
reciting
from
my
memory.
justice
stewart
asked
me
a
question
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
--
relative
to
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
--
the
articles.
i
wasn't
citing
it
for
--
they're
my
statement
of
the
facts.
upon
release
from
the
public
health's
hospital
in
june
of
1957,
the
seaman
immediately
went
to
work
for
his
brother
who
owned
a
taxicab
company
in
newport
news,
virginia.
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
shipowner,
sent
him
a
copy
of
his
medical
discharge
certificate
from
the
public
health
hospital,
requested
a
payment
of
maintenance.
the
owner
investigated
the
claim.
he
contacted
the
master
of
the
vessel.
the
master
of
the
vessel
said,
the
man
had
never
made
any
complaint
onboard
his
ship.
the
law
again
presented
the
case.
the
man
had
been
discharged
in
the
normal
course
of
his
employment.
the
slip
sent
by
the
man
to
the
owner
showed
that
he
reported
to
the
hospital
more
than
two
weeks
after
his
discharge
from
the
vessel.
now,
this
was
an
admission
on
--
omission
on
the
part
of
the
seaman
and
that
he
did
not
tell
the
owner
of
his
original
contact
with
the
hospital.
when
he
had
first
gone
there,
they
had
told
him
to
come
back
some
week
or
six
days
later.
with
these
facts,
the
owner
denied
any
liability
and
no
further
contact
was
heard
from
the
seaman
for
a
period
of
a
year-and-a-half.
for
a
year-and-a-half,
he
did
not
report.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no,
there
was
no
formal
denial.
it
was
denial
and
that
they
did
not
reply.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
yes.
a
year-and-a-half,
the
seaman
did
nothing.
he
worked
and
then
he
had
paid
the
services
of
an
attorney
and
he
filed
a
suit.
a
motion
for
interlocutory
decree
for
award
of
maintenance
was
brought
on
before
the
district
judge.
it
was
heard
and
argued.
the
district
judge,
in
an
order
requiring
the
shipowner
to
pay
the
seaman
$8
per
day
less
what
he
earned
as
a
taxicab
driver.
now,
the
shipowner
complied
with
that
decree
promptly.
and
he
complied
with
it
all
along.
and
this
--
i
think
is
of
interest.
the
judge
did
not
say
to
the
seaman,
you
have
to
continue
working
as
a
taxicab
driver,
but
after
the
decree
was
entered
and
after
the
maintenance
pay
much
were
paid,
the
seaman
continued
to
work
for
a
period
of
some
four
months
until
he
had
been
declared
fit
for
duty
as
a
taxicab
driver.
and
all
during
this
period
of
approximately
two
years
while
this
seaman
was
an
outpatient,
he
was
being
treated
at
public
health
hospital
at
periodic
times,
primarily
with
x-rays.
he
had
a
suspected
chest
condition
that
it
was
never
--
they
were
never
able
to
determine
exactly
what
it
was.
he
was
being
treated
with
the
knowledge
of
the
physicians
that
he
was
doing
this
particular
this
type
of
work.
it
was
not
injurious
to
his
health.
it
was
a
type
of
work
that
he
had
spent
most
of
his
adult
life
doing.
in
fact,
it's
not
in
the
record
but
he
has
continued
to
do
this
work
since
his
discharge
from
the
marine
hospital.
he
has
not
gone
back
to
sea.
but
they
say
he's
not
a
professional
seaman.
as
to
the
law
here
involved,
and
i
think
on
the
law,
we
stand
on
a
very
firm
pedestal.
the
doctrine
of
maintenance
and
cure
is
an
ancient
doctrine.
it
has
its
origin
in
the
laws
of
the
mediterranean
lands
existing
before
the
time
of
christ.
the
principle
basically
was
that
the
seaman
employed
on
a
vessel
was
entitled
to
be
cured
at
the
expense
of
the
owner
if
he
was
injured
or
if
he
incurred
an
illness
in
the
service
of
the
vessel.
this
doctrine
came
down
to
our
early
admiralty
courts
through
the
english
admiralty
courts.
it
was
first
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
osceola
in
1903.
it
had
been
followed
by
the
law
of
admiralty
courts
in
this
country
since
after
the
revolution.
the
osceola
redefined
the
right
of
maintenance
and
cure
saying
that
the
shipowner
owed
to
the
seaman
the
duty
to
furnish
him
maintenance
and
cure
until
he
was
fit
for
duty
or
until
he
had
reach
the
form
of
maximum
cure.
following
the
osceola
in
1904,
this
court
handed
down
a
decision
in
the
iroquois
which
involved
a
sailing
vessel
bound
from
south
america
to
the
united
states
where
there's
seaman
onboard
who
had
suffered
an
attack
of
appendicitis.
and
the
question
was
whether
the
master
should've
put
in
to
the
port
of
valparaiso
in
order
to
give
the
man
more
immediate
medical
care.
and
there,
the
court
in
dicta
said
that
the
shipowner
had
this
particular
duty
to
furnish
him
maintenance
and
furnish
him
cure
as
promptly
as
possible,
that
if
he
did
not
furnish
these
elements,
that
the
seaman
might
have
a
right
of
action.
that
was
dictum.
some
28-29
years
later,
1932,
this
court
handed
down
the
cortes
decision
in
which
a
seaman
died
of
pneumonia
onboard
a
vessel
at
sea.
the
administrator
of
the
seaman's
state
claimed
that
the
vessel
should've
been
put
into
port.
and
there,
this
court
held
that
the
right
of
maintenance
and
cure
was
a
contractual
right.
it
was
a
right
that
grew
out
of
the
contract.
it
was
an
implied
provision
of
the
seaman's
contract.
and
that
if
this
provision
of
the
contract
was
breached,
then
the
seaman's
administrator
in
this
case
had
a
cause
of
action
for
damages,
just
as
you
would
for
the
breach
of
any
contract,
the
damages
that
naturally
float
from
the
breach
which
would
be
expensed
that
the
man
had
to
incur
for
his
own
maintenance
or
for
the
cost
of
his
medical
care
that
he
had
to
employ
or
for
the
damage
that
he
may
have
suffered
in
the
case
of
cortes,
of
the
seaman
that
died.
now,
the
finding
in
this
case
was
that
the
refusal
of
the
shipowner
to
furnish
maintenance
and
cure
did
not
cause
this
seaman
any
physical
or
mental
injury.
in
fact,
the
requiring
of
him
to
go
to
work
was
probably
a
very
good
therapeutic
thing
for
him
to
do.
if
he
had
suffered
any
injury,
he
would
have
a
right
of
action
but
he
has
suffered
none.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
below
rested
its
decision
primarily
on
a
very
learned
decision,
handed
down
by
the
second
circuit,
wilson
against
united
states,
a
decision
written
by
learned
hand,
judge
lumbard
and
judge
medina
in
which
they
held
that
the
right
of
maintenance
was
contractual.
and
it
was
so
contractual
that
the
seaman
had
a
corresponding
duty
to
mitigate.
and
in
that
case
which
i
say
was
on
all
fours
with
this
particular
case,
the
second
circuit
said
that
the
seaman's
earnings,
i
believe
in
that
case
is
a
dishwasher,
were
to
be
credited
against
the
$8
a
day
that
would
do
him
for
maintenance.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
it's
an
implied
provision
of
the
contract.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no.
it
is
contractual
when
it
--
when
he
signs
his
shipping
articles
or
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
--
he
signs
his
employment
contract
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
right.
though
it
is
not
written
in
the
contract,
it
is
an
implied
provision
of
the
contract.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
this
court
not
--
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
the
right
to
pay
maintenance
lasts
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
until
the
man
is
fit
for
duty.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
fit
for
duty
for
any
duties
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
fit
to
become
gainfully
employed.
he
may
never
be
fit
for
duty
as
a
seaman.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
it
can
be
argued
that
it
last
in
--
well,
i
--
that
--
that
is
it,
until
he's
fit
for
duty
--
or
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
--
he
has
reached
the
point
of
maximum
cure
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
of
course
if
he's
never
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
can't
do
anything
else
for
him.
and
you
still
(voice
overlap)
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
right,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
was
their
argument
before
the
district
court.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
on
which,
sir?
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
there
are
no
cases
from
this
court
to
that
effect,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no
sir,
not
up
to
that
effect.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
have
not.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that
is
my
argument,
sir.
i
say
that,
when
this
man
is
capable
of
doing
any
work
of
a
remunerative
nature
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no,
they
did
not
go
that
far,
no,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
to
my
knowledge,
there
is
none.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
i
would
like
to
go
that
far.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
i
would
like
very
much
to
go
that
far.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that
is
--
is
not
the
position
i
have
taken
in
my
brief.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
all
i'm
seeking
is
an
affirmance
of
the
court
below.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
did
not
sir.
there
is
one
other
question
that
mr.
morewitz
has
presented
and
that
is
the
question
of
attorney's
fees.
question
is
so
well
settled
in
our
law
that
i
feel
it
hardly
bear
its
argument
before
this
court.
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
ancient
cases
of
this
court
that
attorney's
fees
are
not
awarded
in
cases
of
contract
and
that's
what
this
is.
this
is
a
suit
under
a
contract,
under
the
implied
agreement
of
a
shipowner
to
furnish
maintenance
and
cure.
certainly,
even
in
tort
actions
except
perhaps
third
party
actions,
there
is
no
law
in
our
country.
there
is
in
england
which
would
permit
the
awarding
of
attorney's
fees.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
justice
black,
i
did
not
say
that
is
a
principle
of
equity.
i
say
that
is
a
principle
of
contract
that
--
as
a
provision
of
the
contract
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that
is
my
argument
here,
that
he
has
the
duty
to
mitigate.
in
other
words,
if
--
in
the
landman's
terms,
if
he
had
a
lease
of
a
house
at
a
$100
a
month
and
he
refused
to
pay
the
rental
and
the
landlord
went
out
and
required
another
rental,
certainly,
the
man
would
be
entitled
to
a
settle.
here,
the
man
has
worked.
it
has
done
him
no
harm.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
your
honor
to
hold
otherwise
would
open
the
whole
feel
of
maintenance
to
considerable
abuse
on
the
part
of
the
seaman.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
of
course,
as
they
say
in
cortes,
as
this
court
held
at
cortes,
the
shipowner
takes
that
particular
chance.
in
other
words,
if
the
seaman's
health
is
injured
or
if
his
illness
is
aggravated,
then
he
must
answer
in
damages
that
are
ascertainable.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
because
there
again,
there
is
no
foundations
in
our
law,
i
say
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct
sir,
for
wanting
attorney's
fees.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
if
you
decide
the
first
question,
if
you
decide
the
first
question
that
the
shipowner
is
entitled
to
have
the
maintenance
mitigated,
then
the
second
question
is
moot.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
it
is
our
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
well,
there
it
is
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
a
separate
question,
sir.
you
are
correct.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no.
he
was
making
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
--
making
less.
and
i
stand
corrected
on
that
that
there
are
two
separate
questions.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no,
sir.
all
we
are
seeking
is
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below.
we
are
not
cross
petitioners.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
there
is.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
i
did
not
believe
your
honor
that
those
cases
are
applicable
to
the
admiralty
law
today.
the
only
cases
i
can
find
that
had
any
indication
of
award
of
attorney's
fees
and
admiralty
related
to
in
rem
cases
against
the
vessel
itself
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
in
rem
cases
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
--
again
--
cases
against
the
vessel
itself,
prize
cases.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
in
the
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
in
the
appollon
i
believe
was
a
prize
case,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
it
was
a
seizure
case.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
expect
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
--
it
has
none
other
than
the
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
other
than
been
limiting
them
within
the
framework
of
the
particular
case
in
bar
itself.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
i
think
it
should
not
be
sir,
because
i
think
it
would
open
the
--
they
fill
up
to
tremendous
abuse
as
far
as
the
seaman
is
concerned.
why
should
the
seaman
today
be
placed
on
a
pedestal
over
and
above
any
other
working
man
in
our
society
of
the
day
of
considering
the
seaman
as
they
want
that
the
admiralty
should
long
have
passed?
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
those
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
--
those
were
the
days
when
they
had
sailing
ships
and
they
impress
people
on
vessels
and
they
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
it's
the
basic
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
your
honor,
as
to
this
phrase,
award
of
admiralty,
i
do
think
it
is
an
underlying
issue
in
this
case.
it's
the
underlying
issue
in
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
in
conclusion
your
honor,
i
would
just
like
to
rephrase
my
argument.
one,
the
right
of
maintenance
is
contractual.
it's
an
implied
provision
of
the
contract.
you
want
me
to
sit
down?
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
i
thought
my
time
was
up.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
it's
an
implied
provision
--
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
--
of
the
--
thank
you,
sir
--
it's
an
implied
provision
of
the
contract.
and
being
such,
the
seaman
should
mitigate
the
amount
due
if
he
can
do
so
without
injury
to
his
health.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
he
did.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
the
second
circuit
has
so
held
that
the
seaman
has
a
duty
to
mitigate,
has
a
duty
to
work
if
he's
able
to
work
even
though
he
is
not
fit
perhaps
to
go
back
to
sea.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
under
my
theory,
then
they
should
be
offset
of
the
reasonable
amount
that
he
could
have
earned.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
was
in
--
in
both
the
perez
and
in
the
wilson
case.
i
believe
that
was
discussed
by
the
second
circuit.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
