i
suppose
you're
arguing
that
if
the
invocative
principle
of
justice

in
order
to
require
this
man
to
surrender
to
the
shipowner
his
little
earnings
he's
made
that
you
also
ask
him
if
we
invoke
the
principles
of
justice
in
equity
to
require
the
shipowner
to
pay
the
attorney's
fees

brought
about
by
the

refusal

say,
his
wages?

(voice

what
wages
had
he
been
making?

how
much
was
he
getting
out
of
this
$8
a

below
the
$200

justice

well,
i
understand
he
didn't
get
that.
that
he's
having
this
suit
to
get
that.
justice

and
they
want

they
want
to
offset
the
little
he
does
get
by

by

he's
earned

where
is
it?
do
you
have
any

fit

it
says
if
he
must

cite

cases
from

have
you
seen
any?

you
think

but
you're
invoking
principles

are
you
not
allow
this
fellow

were
which
until
recently
i
think
that
--
probably
is
not
--
this
law
in
any
of
the
circuit,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
think
--
you
think
that
should
be
bound
by
the
rigid
principle
to
contract
law?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
a
doctrine
that
grew
as
you
know
out
of
trick
principles
of
contract
law
but
whatever
it
is,
it
was
a
theory
that
they
owed
this
man
long
vintage
start
to
pay
him
equity
in
good
conscience.
now,
if
that's
the
spirit
of
the
exception,
why
would
your
client
be
entitled
to
get
the
doctrine
that
drew
up
$8
a
week
set
on
and
yet
standby
and
refuse
to
pay
him
a
cent
of
what
he
owes
him
at
a
time
when
according
to
the
contemplation
of
this
law
which
granted
this,
he
is
greatly
in
need
of
the
house.

or
what
about
considerable
abuse
on
the
part
of
the
employer
not
giving
it
to
him
at
the
time
you
need
him,
when
he
desperately
needs
it,
maybe
this
man
didn't
need
to
(inaudible)

well,
if
he'd
asked
him
damages
first,
aggravation
due
to
the
lack
of
doctor's
treatment,
why
shouldn't
he
answer
the
aggravation
of
damages
to
the
man
due
to
the
fact
that
he
hasn't
go
to
pay
out
his
money
to
get
a
lawyer
rather
than

you
mean
no
