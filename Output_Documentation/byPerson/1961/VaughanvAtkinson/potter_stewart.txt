justice
potter
stewart
the
voyage
had
ended
at
the
time
he
was
discharged?
justice
potter
stewart
all
you
have
to
show
is
that
the
injury
or
illness
or
incapacity
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
occurred
while
you
were
in
the
service
of
the
ship?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
morewitz,
let
me
get
a
couple
of
things
straight
in
my
own
mind,
cure
is
not
involved
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
right
from
the
beginning
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
cure
is
not
in
any
way
involved
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
all
that
is
involved
is
maintenance?
justice
potter
stewart
and
now,
what
is
it
--
your
position
that
--
the
--
that
it
was
the
extent
of
the
respondent's
obligations
so
far
as
maintenance
goes
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
told
us
the
voyage
had
ended.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
shall
think
of
it
at
least
be
arguable
that
there
was
absolutely
no
obligation
with
respect
to
maintenance.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
well
then
how
--
what's
--
how
long
would
this
obligation
to
pay
maintenance
continue
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
until
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
be
--
he's
either
cured
or
it
was
shown
that
he
was
incurable?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
obligation
to
pay
maintenance
would
go
on
until
that
point
was
reached?
justice
potter
stewart
go
back
to
work
as
a
seaman
or
go
back
to
work
generally
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
the
contract
didn't
--
the
contract
specified
the
amount
of
--
for
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
dollars
to
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
didn't
go
to
the
question
of
how
long
it
should
be
paid
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
matter
of
law,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
that's
not
purported
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
point
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
bargaining
period.
it's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
amount
that's
specified,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
unconditional
amount
that
specified
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
amount
per
day?
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
i
would
--
i
should
think,
it
just
appears
to
me
that
the
respondent
could
take
an
even
more
extreme
position.
once
a
person
is
able
to
earn
wages,
i
should
think
the
respondent
might
be
able
to
say
what
my
obligation
to
pay
any
maintenance
at
all
is
terminated.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
say
he
got
a
job
but
not
as
a
seaman
but
as
vice
president
of
general
motors
of
--
by
50
times
what
a
seaman
earns.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
he
was
still
entitled
to
maintenance?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument,
i
should
think,
would
lead
you
to
answer
yes.
he's
entitled
to
main
--
entitled
to
maintenance
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
not
able
to
work
as
a
seaman.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
(voice
overlap)
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
while
he's
in
the
hospital,
he
gets
both
maintenance
and
cure,
does
he?
justice
potter
stewart
from
the
hospital?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
board
and
lodging
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
cure.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
kind
of
a
11th
century
social
security,
you
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
was
any
given
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
any
reason
given
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
morewitz,
i
--
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
the
laws
to
attorney's
fees
in
cases
like
this,
is
there
any
statue
limiting
the
amount
of
attorney
fees?
justice
potter
stewart
there
isn't
any.
and
are
attorney's
fees
recoverable
against
a
shipowner?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
one
of
the
questions,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
attorney's
fees
are
recoverable?
justice
potter
stewart
his
employment,
his
articles
when
he
signed
on,
what
were
the
terms
of
his
employment?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
terrain?
justice
potter
stewart
signed
on
for
a
round
trip
voyage,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
contractual,
you
mean
it's
an
implied
term
which
the
law
imposes
upon
a
contract
with
seaman's
contractual
record
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
contractual.
it's
not
--
not
subject
to
its
expressed
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
implied
term
which
the
law
imposes
upon
that
contract
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
--
well,
i
interrupted
you,
may
i
ask
you
this.
is
it
your
understanding
that
maintenance
is
that
--
what
maintenance
is
supposed
to
be
cover
is
his
board
and
lodging
pending
cure?
justice
potter
stewart
historically
that
was
it,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
when
you're
an
inpatient
in
the
hospital,
you
get
both
maintenance
and
cure.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
only
when
you're
an
outpatient
that
maintenance
is
a
separate
item,
becomes
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let
me
ask
you
then.
how
long
does
it
--
how
long
does
this
duty
last
to
pay
maintenance
in
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
the
duty
to
pay
maintenance,
the
duty
of
the
shipowner.
justice
potter
stewart
fit
for
duty
is
what?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
--
yes,
that's
right
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
until
he's
determined
that
he
was
not
curable.
justice
potter
stewart
historically
that
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
is
fit
for
duty
is
what?
and
if
this
is
true,
i
should
think
your
--
your
answer
would
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
once
this
man
began
working
as
a
taxi
driver,
you
didn't
owe
him
any
maintenance.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
would
you
be
amazed
if
this
man
had
got
--
gotten
a
job
as
vice
president
of
ger
--
general
motors
for
a
court
and
worked
there
for
20
years
and
it
shown,
he
could
never
work
as
a
sailor
again,
would
you
have
been
surprised
if
a
district
court
have
said,
"well,
you're
no
longer
entitled
to
maintenance
by
the
shipowner?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
going
that
far
here?
justice
potter
stewart
i've
only
suggested
that
you
might
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
--
you're
not,
that's
not
your
position.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
why
is
that
a
separate
and
not
moot
question?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
it
your
point
that
he
was
making
more
than
$8
a
day
as
a
taxi
driver?
justice
potter
stewart
i
can
understand.
if
that
were
the
case
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
could
be
moot.
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
a
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
it's
your
--
perhaps,
this
isn't
presented
by
this
case,
but
is
it
--
generally,
in
the
law
of
damages
in
contract
actions,
it's
the
duty
to
mitigate.
but
you
don't,
i
suppose,
have
to
make
that
argument
here
because
the
fact
is,
he
did.
justice
potter
stewart
get
extra
earnings
and
so
you
say,
at
least,
when
he
has
in
fact
mitigated
his
damages,
he
should
--
the
employer
should
not
give
him
a
windfall.
justice
potter
stewart
should
not
be
required
to
give
him
a
windfall.
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
would
follow,
i
suppose
from
your
argument,
the
logic
of
your
argument,
if
this
is
a
contractual
action
that
he
has
a
duty
to
mitigate.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if
he
didn't
--
what
if
he
didn't
under
your
theory?
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
could've
earned
in
the
exercise
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
find
those
concepts
in
measuring
damages
in
ordinary
contractor
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
sometimes
it's
difficult
to
establish
but
the
concept
is
nevertheless
there.
