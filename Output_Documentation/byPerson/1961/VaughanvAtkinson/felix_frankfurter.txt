so
we
can't
put
--
there
aren't
any
scales
by
which
we
can
weigh
their
respective
appeal,
their
professional
judgment
or
wisdom
and
(inaudible)
judge
soper
and
judge
sobeloff,
can
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
source
of
the
doctrine
of
maintenance?
what's
the
source
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
judge
may
think,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
derives
from
a
sense
of
public
policy
that
that
human
being
seaman,
they
ought
not
to
be
cast
adrift,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
of
course
you
don't
restrict
as
to
determining
the
rightness
of
the
result
of
judge
soper
to
his
own
--
to
his
reasoning.
i
suppose
we
have
a
little
latitude
in
that
regard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
couldn't
find
a
better
reason?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
find
a
better
reason
than
he
gave?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
suggest
some
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
suggest
some.
there's
a
general
principle
of
law
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
public
interest,
we're
dealing
here
with
a
public
interest,
namely
the
protection
of
a
seaman.
there's
a
general
principle
of
law
that
damages
of
a
legal
in
--
of
a
person
may
be
entitled
to
them
must
be
reduced.
the
man
can't
fold
his
arms
and
say,
we'll
take
a
good
number
of
contracts
where
cases
have
arisen.
the
man
is
employed
by
a
company,
so
much
for
years
and
he's
unduly
discharged,
he
was
unduly
fired.
i
suppose
the
doctrine
is
universal
that
he
can't
just
say,
well,
you
charged
me
unfairly.
i'm
going
to
sue
you.
i
was
--
demand
a
salary
of
$20,000
or
$10,000
or
$5000
or
$50,000.
and
not
only
can't
he
just
collect
all
that
he
would've
earned
if
he
stayed
there
but
there's
almost
a
duty
to
reduce
the
damages
because
society
--
it's
the
society's
interest
not
to
have
economic
weight.
this
court
adopted
that
--
applied
that
doctrine
in
the
labor
cases
where
an
employee
who
however
affluent
he
may
be
in
this
questionably
affluent
society,
isn't
too
affluent
so
he
can't
fold
his
arms.
and
we
held
that
the
employer
who
disobeyed
the
wagner
act
must
make
good
but
not
to
the
extent
that
you
can't
deduct
what
the
employee
earned
or
reasonably
could
have
earned.
now,
please
tell
me
why
that
doctrine
doesn't
apply
to
this
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
maintenance
is
full
of
purpose,
namely
that
he
should
be
sustained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
he
can
sustain
himself
or
has
sustained
himself
by
earning
otherwise,
why
should
the
law
which
is
law
imposed,
law
enforce,
why
should
the
law
say,
although
you
were
maintained
by
having
a
job
nevertheless,
they
think
the
fellow
efficiency,
owner's
duty,
the
ships
duty
is
to
maintain
you
although
you
have
been
maintained."
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you're
sustained,
you're
also
entitled
to
maintenance
because
we
are
here
to
determine
whether
you're
entitled
to
maintenance
under
these
conditions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
you
can't
say
the
exactly
the
same
thing
regarding
the
employer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
exactly
the
same
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
employer
has
fired
him
and
the
employer
was
entitled
to
earn
wages
that
felt
stodge,
but
in
the
meantime,
he
earned
--
he
had
an
income
otherwise,
i
don't
mean
of
an
income
because
the
rich
uncle
died,
an
income
to
working
otherwise
and
you
might
say
the
employer
had
a
windfall.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
gotten
any
of
those
conditions
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
touch
the
doctrine
of
(inaudible)
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
touch
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
provide
maintenance.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
he
has
seen
to
it
that
he's
had
maintenance
and
you're
concerned,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
judge
sobeloff
is
concerned
on
what
he
calls
windfall
of
what
he
thinks
will
be
an
inducement
against
the
shipowner
not
to
do
what
is
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
i
may
hold
them
for
that.
it
doesn't
fall
on
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
everything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
other
way
around?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
other
way
around?
suppose
the
--
for
some
reason
or
rather
he's
disabled
to
be
a
seaman,
quite
able
to
be
an
accountant
on
land
or
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
two
--
to
be
intermingled
interchangeable
namely,
whether
one
erred
to
be
a
--
a
deduction
officer
at
mitigation
call
it
what
you
will
if
the
fellow
is
actually
earning
therefore,
he
is
--
therefore
maintenance
would
be
a
windfall
for
him
in
addition
to
what
he's
earning
and
the
question
whether
they
should
him
counsel
fee
in
court.
of
the
two
is
--
must
i
have
decide
both
of
those
questions
the
same
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
i
don't
follow
that
at
all.
why
is
that
moot?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he's
entitled
to
mitigation,
still
the
mitigation
means
something
into
--
deducted
from
something
else,
i
say
he's
qualified
but
he
still
have
to
go
to
court
and
sue
that
part
of
it
to
which
he
was
entitled
and
that
was
withheld
from
him,
and
he
had
to
hire
a
lawyer
so
why
shouldn't
he
be
compensated
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
involved
a
question
of
the
right
to
counsel,
do
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
your
--
well,
maybe
i'm
out
of
order
but
what
--
when
you
come
to
it,
what
is
your
answer
to
mr.
morewitz's
question
--
contention
that
--
with
reference
to
the
admiralty
cases
which
were
referred
to
in
the
ticonic
case
namely
that's
a
matter
of
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
related
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
didn't
--
justice
story
didn't
--
the
story
opinions
didn't
solve
them,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they?
in
the
appollon
and
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
judge
--
justice
story
said
explicitly
it's
true
on
the
prize
side
and
on
the
instance
side.
and
it
does
--
i
don't
understand
why
that
isn't
good
sense
as
admiralty
become
more
rigid
since
it's
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
justice
story
pointed
out,
there
was
no
statute.
that
admiralty
therefore
was
free
to
do
what
it
was
free
to
do
of
all
this
private
difficulty
of
--
of
interested
in
mr.
morewitz
(inaudible)
pointed
that
admiralty
has
more
equity
power
from
equity
(inaudible)
we
encounter
the
phrase,
there
are
no
equity
powers
in
admiralty,
i
never
could
understand
that
either
reluctantly
i
don't
understand.
but
i
don't
--
has
there
been
a
limitation
of
those
early
decisions
of
story's?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
happens
and
i'm
accountable
for
not
having
referred
to
them
in
ticonic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
particular
cases,
i
understand
that.
it
may
well
be,
i'm
sure
there
are
particular
cases
where
attorney's
fees
as
part
of
course,
as
part
of
damages,
whatever
you
can
call
them,
were
not
allowed
or
were
disallowed.
but
i
do
not
know
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
it
is
so
that
the
direction
of
thought
of
those
cases
of
story's,
and
i
don't
suppose
we've
had
a
great
admiralty
judge
since
his
time,
laid
down
namely,
that
it's
been
into
discretion
of
admiralty
and
why
shouldn't
it
be?
admiralty
is
a
very
imaginative
branch
in
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
maybe
so,
but
were
talking
about
the
power
of
a
court
charged
with
enforcing
ancient
rules
that
had
come
down
today
namely,
certain
protective
rules
in
favor
of
a
seaman
and
he's
been
brought
into
court,
he's
been
brought
into
court
for
non
--
for
the
failure
of
the
respondent
here
to
fulfill
at
least
certain
obligations,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he's
been
brought
into
court
and
why
should
the
admiralty
court
of
today
--
i
think
you're
(inaudible)
that
i
see
in
this
case,
why
should
that
involve
whether
we
have
to
decide
the
abstract
question
whether
a
seaman
is
still
awarded
for
court.
i
have
a
good
feel
of
sympathy
with
your
objection
to
the
incantation
of
that
phrase
in
these
days
when
the
situation
was
different
but
that
isn't
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
problem
is
whether
he
was
brought
in
to
admiralty
with
an
ancient
rule
of
admiralty
that
the
admiralty
--
admiralty
has
discretion
to
decide
whether
you
should
say
--
whether
the
withholding
party
should
pay
the
expenses
of
a
lawsuit,
it's
as
simple
as
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
depends
--
depends
how
we
made
the
orders
and
how
we
decide
this
case
on
the
other
issues.
that's
why
i
wanted
a
separate
the
issue.
they're
very
different
issues
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
submit
also
there's
another
word
of
controversy,
whether
this
is
a
matter
of
contract
and
not
a
contract,
the
kind
of
contract
that
justice
stewart
indicated
a
little
earlier.
when
we
say
it's
a
matter
of
contract,
what
we
mean
to
say
is
that
the
law
infuses
that
condition
into
the
contract,
where
the
contract
says
nothing
about
it,
is
that
what
it
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
derives
it
from
a
--
from
policy,
it
goes
back
to
whatever
it
is,
pre-tries
the
event
from
11th
a.d.
century
so
it's
just
the
way
of
saying
the
same
thing
and
with
one
legal
concept
rather
than
other
that's
imposed
by
law
or
being
imposed
by
law,
it's
implied
into
whatever
is
written
in
the
articles
of
--
when
they
sign
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
sign
on.
