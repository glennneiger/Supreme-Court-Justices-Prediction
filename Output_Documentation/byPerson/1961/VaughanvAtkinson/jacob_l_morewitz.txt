mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
this
is
a
case
here
on
certiorari
-from
the
fourth
circuit
involving
a
seaman
in
the
characterization
of
mr.
justice
story
awarded
the
admiralty.
the
uniqueness
is
that
seldom
the
case
of
this
import
require
the
intervention
or
intervent
--
interposition
as
some
people
might
call
it
of
this
honorable
court.
there
are
two
questions
involved
and
set
forth
in
our
petition,
two
principal
questions,
whether
or
not
maintenance
is
the
sto
--
is
designed
to
restore
post-earnings
of
itself
and
the
right
to
maintenance
whether
it
should
be
unaffected
by
the
incidental
earning
at
shore
while
the
seaman
is
a
patient
under
treatment,
unfit
to
do
seaman's
work.
and
there's
a
second
point
as
to
where
a
shipowner
for
23
months
has
held
by
both
courts
below
at
least
in
the
minority
opinion
refers
to
the
finding
of
fact
which
are
conclusive
both
on
the
court
below
and
this
court
unless
the
court
goes
back
to
the
earlier
theory
of
a
new
trial
both
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
here
in
an
admiralty
case
where
the
shipowner
refuses
to
pay
maintenance
for
23
months
to
a
sick
seaman
and
for
--
thereby
forcing
the
seaman
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
an
expensive
in
--
instituting
a
suit,
obtaining
a
decree
of
the
admiralty
court
for
his
maintenance
during
these
23
months
period.
we
say
that
the
shipowner
cannot
escape
paying
damages
merely
because
the
seaman
eventually
gets
well.
and
in
that,
we
are
supported
by
the
opinion
of
chief
judge
sobeloff
who
wrote
the
minority
orders
sending
opinion
in
the
court
below.
vaughan,
the
seaman
in
this
case,
had
been
employed
aboard
the
vessel
on
two
previous
voyages
and
--
where
he's
paid
off
on
march
the
2nd,
1957.
it's
important
to
keep
the
dates
in
mind
to
show
these
23
months
dereliction
as
the
trial
court
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
for
which
the
seaman
was
only
recompensed
to
the
extent
of
interest
on
the
weekly
payments,
they
should've
had
all
during
these
23
months
of
delay.
and
incidentally,
some
six
months
of
the
final
payment
was
made
after
the
libel
was
filed.
the
case
was
in
court
and
the
trial
judge
had
to
take
the
matter
up
on
two
separate
occasions
before
the
final
payments
were
made.
now,
the
--
when
the
man
was
discharged,
he
was
given
a
certificate
to
enter
the
marine
hospital
at
norfolk
(ph)
which
he
did
on
march
the
7th
and
he
was
examined
on
that
day
and
told
to
come
back
on
march
the
18th.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
the
voyage
--
the
particular
trip
now
--
your
honors
in
a
case
some
years
ago
divided
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
provision,
the
usual
provision
in
a
foreign
voyage
of
a
six
--
termination,
no
less
than
six
months
or
no
more
than
six
months
rather.
some
of
your
honors
minority
opinion
there
held
that
the
six
months
provision
prevailed
and
the
majority
i
think
it
was
a
five-four
decisions.
the
majority
held
that
it
terminated
as
your
honor
suggested,
when
the
trip
was
over,
he
was
paid
off
and
got
a
discharge
from
the
ship
no
matter
what
the
article
might
have
called
for
with
regard
to
a
minimum
period.
in
this
case,
he
received
his
wages
on
march
the
2nd
and
then
given
the
certificate
entitling
him
without
any
cost
to
either
the
vessel
or
to
the
man
to
be
en
--
to
enter
and
be
treated
at
the
marine
hospital
that's
covered
by
a
fund
that's
created
out
of
some
of
the
taxes
that
the
shipowner
has
to
pay
in
entering
and
clearing
the
customs
on
foreign
voyages.
now,
the
man
entered
the
hospital
as
i've
suggested
on
march
the
18th,
1957
and
was
under
treatment
until
june
the
6th,
1957.
and
during
that
period
under
the
law,
he
could
not
recover
any
maintenance
because
he
received
his
board
and
lodging
while
he
was
in
the
hospital.
but
immediately
upon
leaving
the
hospital,
under
the
principles
enunciated
during
the
day
of
the
(inaudible),
they
started
the
--
the
status
of
the
seaman
as
i've
said
of
being
awarded
the
admiralty
because
primarily
in
those
days,
he
couldn't
recover.
they
were
killed,
there
were
no
death
statutes
and
the
--
in
most
instances,
couldn't
recover
even
for
an
unseaworthy
vessel.
that
doctrine
came
along
a
hundred
years
after.
but
he
--
from
time
immemorial
got
maintenance
and
cure
and
that's
been
thought
or
furthered
away
to
some
extent
by
the
last
principles
that
have
been
announced
that
they
--
if
he
can't
be
cured,
if
he's
beyond
cure,
then
they
--
the
harsh
rule
is
that
the
shipowner's
liability
stops
that
he
--
the
only
time
that
the
shipowner
has
to
enforce
to
pay
is
when
there
is
some
possibility
of
his
recovery.
and
he
must
establish
that
he
has
been
in
the
employ
of
the
vessel
when
this
injury
or
the
sickness
occurred.
and
that's
entirely
separate
apart
from
what
your
honors
have
heard
under
the
jones
act
and
under
the
unseaworthy
doctrine
as
to
the
liability
of
the
shipowner
for
damages
or
any
negligent
or
injury
whether
willful
or
not
or
whether
it's
a
--
as
a
result
of
the
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel.
but
this
doctrine
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes,
your
honor.
but
we
say
and
the
chief
judge
in
the
court
below
agreed
with
us,
that
here
and
the
--
the
district
judge
in
entering
up
his
judgment
while
he
--
doesn't
--
the
use
--
the
vigorous
language
as
the
chief
justice
--
chief
judge
sobeloff
is
--
agrees
that
this
was
a
callous
disregard
of
the
rights
of
this
seaman
or
any
other
seaman
to
recover
maintenance
under
the
circumstances
unless
that
it
in
this
case
and
at
that
disregard
continued
for
some
two
months
after
the
libel
was
filed.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
cure
is
not
involved
because
he
was
under
treatment,
had
outpatient
treatment
for
as
--
over
two
years,
i
think.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
and
he
was
discharged
finally
as
fit
for
duty
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
--
as
a
seaman.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
cure
is
not
involved.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
is
the
maintenance.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
well
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
no,
your
honor.
your
honors
availed
in
the
--
from
the
days
of
mr.
justice
story
up
to
present,
no
court
as
far
as
i
know
had
held
that
it
ends
with
a
trip
because
that
would
knock
out
all
the
benefits
that
a
seaman
would
get
by
reason
of
his
employment.
if
you
just
cast
him
a
shore
and
put
him
on
relief
or
subject
to
charity
the
very
thing
that
the
initial
principles
when
a
seaman
was
a
slave
was
created
to
prevent.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
until
he
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
until
he
is
either
cured
or
there's
no
possibility
of
cure
as
i
announced
originally.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
i
don't
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
that's
the
principle.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes,
your
honor.
now
here,
without
any
excuse
whatsoever,
i
haven't
heard
a
whole
lot
today
and
i
was
very
much
interested
in
the
national
labor
relations
cases
with
regard
to
the
proposition
of
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
owner
or
the
employer.
in
the
case
at
bar,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
burden
was
on
the
respondent's
shipowner
convinced
both
of
the
lower
courts
if
he
could.
he
had
a
faith
of
any
kind.
good
--
certainly,
we
have
a
right
to
argue
as
the
--
intermitted
by
the
chief
judge's
opinion,
the
case
below
that
the
shipowner's
faith
in
this
case
was
entirely
bad
that
he
had
no
excuse
whatsoever
and
didn't
endeavor
to
even
argue
much
less
establish
in
the
courts
below
that
he
paid
any
regard
to
this
seaman's
rights
with
regard
to
maintenance,
it's
been
long
established,
which
doesn't
require
any
contract
of
the
courts
and
this
court
have
held
in
the
ca
--
the
decision
that's
cited
by
both
sides
of
mr.
justice
cardozo
with
regard
to
the
establishment.
the
only
thing
that
the
seaman
has
to
establish
is
that
he's
been
employed
onboard
of
this
vessel
and
is
given
service
on.
it
doesn't
go
so
far
as
to
--
to
be
a
self-infatuating
insurance,
but
it
goes
pretty
close
to
it
and
then
in
some
respects
even
--
we
think
go
to
a
lot
further
because
i
don't
know
if
there
may
be
some
insurance
policies
that
require
the
insurance
company
to
pay
forever
if
there's
any
chance
of
the
seaman
reestablishing
himself
but
i
think
it
goes
to
that
extent
in
the
case
of
this
sort
if
there's
any
probable
reason
to
believe
that
the
seaman
can
recover
so
he
can
go
back
to
work.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
i
think
under
the
present
day,
the
charge
that
he
gets
for
them
--
the
hospital
in
which
took
over
two
years
here
to
get,
was
that
he
was
fit
for
duty
as
a
seaman.
and
in
the
meantime,
what
the
shipowner
is
seeking
to
take
advantage
of
here
that
he
was
employed
as
a
part-time
taxi
driver
and
had
some
earnings
during
that
period,
during
that
long
period
while
the
shipowner
wasn't
paying
him
anything.
that
shipowner
under
the
trial
judge's
decision
was
able
to
deduct
the
maintenance
from
the
--
deduct
from
the
amount
of
maintenance
that
he
was
undoubtedly
entitled
to
receive
under
a
union
contract
which
is
unconditional
if
your
honors
will
read
it
both
so
far
as
we
referred
to
it
here
and
i'll
refer
to
it
in
a
moment.
under
the
union
contract
here
which
is
contrary
to
what
your
honors
have
heard
in
the
labor
relations
cases
if
necessarily
be
negotiated
before
it
could
be
enact
--
acted
upon.
here,
there's
no
question
about
what
the
union
contract
had
been
negotiated
and
repeatedly
renegotiated
that
what
it
contains
and
it's
unqualified.
and
yet,
with
all
of
the
line,
the
plain
language
that
it
contains,
the
shipowner
without
making
any
attempt
to
rely
on
it
prior
to
the
time
the
suit
was
instituted,
was
able
to
convince
the
trial
court
and
the
majority
of
the
court
below
that
the
amount
that
he
earned
when
he
was
forced
to
work
in
order
to
keep
himself
going
to
in
this
period
that
he
was
a
patient
that
that
should
be
duc
--
deducted
from
the
maintenance
that
was
due
him
under
the
contract.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
and
it
also
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
your
honor,
made
it
unconditional
with
no
conditions
in
the
contract,
it
even
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
well,
that
--
the
--
as
i
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
that's
a
matter
of
law.
it's
implied,
they
didn't
have
any
contract,
didn't
have
to
have
any
contract
to
cover
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
--
to
begin
with.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
no,
sir.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
now,
the
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
the
unconditional
amount
and
the
unconditional
way
in
which
it
was
to
be
paid.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
to
be
paid
weekly.
and
it
was
to
be
paid
without
any
question
as
through
the
position
of
a
lawyer
that
even
ignored
any
lien
that
a
lawyer
might
have
or
any
course
under
the
statute
of
the
united
states
that
your
honor
probably
familiar
where
that
--
they
--
you
couldn't
attach
the
wages
of
a
seaman
under
any
circumstances
for
any
claim
that
the
shipowner
might
have
or
anybody
else
might
have.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
that
when
he
is
entitled
to
wages
under
the
law
as
laid
down
for
nearly
a
100
years
by
congress
that
they
--
you
can't
arrest
his
wages
and
you
certainly
couldn't
arrest
his
maintenance.
you
can't
even
do
that
on
a
workman's
compensation.
but
they
--
here,
the
court
below
said
that
the
--
and
the
trial
court
held
that
the
prevailing
opinion
of
the
majority
opinions
supported
the
view
that
it
could
be
deducted.
we
say
that
the
majority
opinions
were
the
other
way
and
that
on
reason
and
authority,
it's
the
other
way.
and
i
come
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes,
your
honor.
that
would
be
true
if
he
was
reestablished
in
the
status
of
a
seaman
so
he
could
earn
what
he
was
able
to
earn
as
a
seaman.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
well
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
no,
sir.
but
because
there,
it
was
--
certainly
be
presumed
that
he
had
gotten
a
whole
lot
higher
status
than
he
would've
as
a
seaman
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
--
and
was
able
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
--
to
earn
more
money.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
well,
if
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
if
i
want
to
be
extreme
about
it
i
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
i
might
and
he
could
but
i
don't
want
to
be
that
extreme.
but
they
--
the
--
they
are
--
they
conca
--
the
setup
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below
which
we
of
course
rely
on
here,
the
dissenting
opinion
is
unanswerable.
and
the
majority
opinions
your
honors,
i
think
are
bound
to
agree
doesn't
attempt
to
answer.
and
they
--
there
the
--
while
i
have
great
respect
for
judge
soper,
we've
been
on
the
bench
for
a
long
while,
he
doesn't
attempt
to
discuss
the
main
propositions
that
chief
judge
sobeloff
sets
forth
at
some
length.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
opinion
of
judge
soper,
i
think
it's
about
no
more
than
two
pages
and
refers
to
the
decisions
in
the
second
circuit
as
being
a
better
view
than
the
decision
in
the
third
circuit.
the
fact
remains
that
the
principles
that
are
applicable
to
the
case
that
we
have
here
are
enunciated
as
firmly
as
it
could
be
by
chief
judge
sobeloff.
and
that
no
reference
to
those
principles
are
made
by
judge
--
now,
of
course
i
go
along
with
this
if
your
honors
agree,
with
judge
soper
then
we
have
--
got
any
case
here.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
sir?
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes.
but
we
--
we're
--
certainly
have
every
reason
to
hope
that
your
honors
are
bound
to
be
convinced
by
judge
sobeloff's
opinion
here
whether
and
we
are
not
trying
to
sort
of
gild
the
lily
by
anything
in
our
brief.
we
have
a
proposition
here
where
the
court
below
an
experienced
judge
and
the
chief
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland
and
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
had
been
on
the
court
of
appeals
now
for
some
four
or
five
years
that
a
--
he
is
taking
this
view
and
that
the
majority
in
no
way
had
been
able
to
demonstrate
that
he
is
in
anyway
wrong.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
no
sir,
except
this
that
if
the
reasoning
of
a
one
as
against
the
other
appeals
to
the
court
has
been
the
fair
and
just
way
of
handling
a
thing
of
this
sort
which
affects
one
of
the
lowest
class
of
our
citizen.
and
incidentally,
in
--
well,
this
is
a
case
involving
american
citizen
on
an
american
ship.
whatever
judgment
of
this
court
is,
it
will
affect
seamen
at
large
because
as
i've
pointed
out,
the
proposition
of
maintenance
and
the
--
and
their
refusal
to
take
care
of
it
for
some
23
months
as
in
the
case
at
bar
would
be
a
whole
lot
worse
in
the
case
of
a
foreign
seaman
if
he
were
cast
ashore
and
put
in
an
american
hospital
and
no
way
of
getting
home
and
beaten
in
any
such
way
as
this.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
he
gets
at
the
expense
of
the
united
states.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
and
he
also
gets
medical
treatment.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
in
law
--
the
--
it
was
a
non
--
it
was
developed
as
i
have
stated
--
suggested
for
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
oh
yes,
that
the
admiralty
judge
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
it
--
there
--
it
certainly
goes
further
than
the
present
day
ideas
with
regard
to
a
man
falling
ill
while
he's
employed
by
a
land
employer
because
a
seaman
at
sea
is
helpless.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
no,
sir.
but
they
--
i
don't
think
your
honors
could
if
you
--
he
even
agreed
with
judge
soper.
he
could
agree.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
sir?
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
no
i
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
i
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
i
refer
again
to
judge
sobeloff's
opinion
and
say
to
your
honor
this,
that
there's
a
vital
distinction
between
wages
earned
particularly
on
shore
and
maintenance
such
as
--
as
implied
in
the
contract
for
seamen
because
he's
entitled
to
maintenance
plus
wages.
the
seaman
is
entitled
to
wages
plus
his
maintenance
as
long
as
the
voyage
continues.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
but
your
honor,
in
this
case
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
but,
the
position
that
we
take,
supported
by
judge
sobeloff
is
that
the
shipowner
can't
take
unilateral
action
to
force
a
seaman
to
be
employed
so
as
--
in
order
to
create
a
windfall
if
you
want
to
term
it
that,
in
the
reduction
of
what
is
undoubtedly
due
under
the
seaman's
contract.
he
doesn't
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes,
but
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
but
you've
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes
sir,
but
if
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
but
now
here,
the
contract
says
that
this
payment
shall
be
made
your
honor,
regardless
of
whether
he
has
or
has
not
obtained
an
attorney,
filed
a
claim
for
damages
or
taken
any
other
steps
to
that
end
and
irrespective
of
any
insurance
arrangements
in
effect
between
the
company
and
any
insurer.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes,
your
honor.
you
have
that
--
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so,
you
have
a
proposition
that
the
shipowner
made
no
attempt
to
pay
him
any
even
the
part
that
he
was
forced
to
pay
later.
the
difference
made
no
attempt
and
supposed
to
paid
rigidly
on
a
weekly
basis.
but
here,
he
paid
nothing
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
the
placement
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
no,
sir.
and
they're
attempting
to
give
some
excuse
in
this
court.
but
as
said
by
both
courts
below,
in
judge
sobeloff
particularly,
they
didn't
attempt
to
defend
themselves
even
or
argue
in
the
court
below.
of
course
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
(inaudible)
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
taken
up
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
no,
sir
but
i
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
but
the
point
that
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
what
i
have
to
take
in
consideration
here,
did
you
have
to
make
the
vital
distinction
between
his
earnings
as
wages
and
his
--
and
the
obligation
of
the
shipowner
to
provide
maintenance
plus
his
wages.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
but
he
didn't
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
but
if
i
may
be
prevented
your
honor
here,
the
shipowner
disregarded
even
the
part
that
he
was
forced
later
to
pay.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes,
but
that
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
but
in
addition
to
that
--
all
the
expense
now
your
honor
in
the
case
here
in
the
last
10
years
held
different
to
what
our
friends
on
the
other
side
have
said
with
regard
to
the
payment
of
attorney's
fees
to
recover
this
half
of
what
he
was
originally
entitled
to
get.
that's
also
--
he
loses
that
too
so
the
net
result
is
that
he
gets
very
little
--
what
his
contract
call
for
in
the
face
of
the
contract
which
says
that
the
attorney's
obligation
should
be
disregarded.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
they
--
well
that's
one
of
the
questions
this
court
has
not
called
on
to
decide.
judge
sobeloff
says
he
thinks
in
any
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
sir?
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes
sir,
that's
one
of
the
principal
questions
in
the
case.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
whether
or
not
as
between
solicitor
and
client
as
set
forth
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
this
ticonic
case
sometime
ago,
whether
that's
an
--
the
court
there
--
in
that
case
in
a
footnote
referred
to
the
admiralty
rule
which
was
disregarded
by
both
the
majority
opinion
and
the
trial
court's
opinion
that
attorney's
fees
as
between
solicitor
and
client
are
recoverable
in
the
case
of
this
sort.
and
this
is
a
vital
question
that
isn't
the
--
this
--
i
don't
imagine
your
honor
for
a
grant
of
certiorari
to
begin
with.
if
you
didn't
think
it
was
important
enough
to
--
with
regard
to
a
future
conduct
of
a
shipowner
with
regard
to
a
seaman
to
be
disregarded
in
the
flagrant
way
in
which
this
is
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
and
what
--
what
--
what
we
have
to
keep
mind
if
i
may
say
so
is
earning
it
on
the
vessel
is
over
--
with
something
like
$305
a
month.
his
maintenance
only
amounted
to
$56
a
week
and
out
of
that
$56
a
week
--
now
on
the
vessel
while
h
was
employed
on
the
vessel
in
addition
to
his
wage,
he
got
his
board
to
keep.
and
he
got
it
while
he
was
in
the
hospital.
but
he
didn't
get
it
after
he
got
out
of
the
hospital.
and
from
that
pittance
that
he
was
set
up
one-sixth
to
what
he's
original
earnings
were
are
deducted
--
what
he
was
able
to
scrape
around
and
get
as
a
part-time
taxi
driver.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
something
like
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
$305
a
month.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
$56
a
week.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
but
the
trouble
is
he
didn't
get
it.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes.
he
now
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
he
will
--
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
yes.
not
only
do
they
want
to
do
it
but
they
were
already
been
permitted
to
do
it.
and
he
hasn't
got
it.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
that
is
maintenance.
and
he
--
and
they
--
the
--
he
was
able
to
have
some
regular
routine
in
what
he
was
doing.
this
way
he
had
--
of
course
we
haven't
brought
up
in
this
case.
he
had
some
expense
in
going
to
and
from
the
hospital
in
order
to
get
this
outpatient
treatment.
that
hasn't
been
recompensed
here
in
anyway.
but
out
of
the
$56
a
week,
there
was
a
deduction
of
something
like
half
or
$25
or
$30
a
week
from
the
$56
and
the
--
under
the
rulings
of
the
courts
below,
he
only
got
the
difference.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
a
court
of
equity
would
count
this
--
leave
aside
a
court
of
admiralty
which
is
forced
to
go
somewhat
further
even
on
a
court
of
equity,
which
happens
in
that
sort.
now,
if
the
shipowner
--
i'd
go
this
far
--
if
the
shipowner
had
paid
this
man
anything
at
all
or
even
made
a
refusal
to
pay,
they
didn't
even
acknowledge
his
letter,
sending
him
a
copy
of
the
hospital
report
when
he
left
the
hospital,
registered
mail.
they
didn't
even
acknowledge
that.
just
simply
ignored
the
whole
business
until
he
filed
this
libel
and
then
didn't
pay
anything
until
the
--
not
only
judge
had
a
hearings
some
two
months
after
the
libel
was
filed
but
i
don't
know,
i
wasn't
there
when
the
case
was
tried
but
i
don't
know
how
the
trial
judge
intermitted
what
he
would
do
but
certainly
they
had
to
pay
him
something
even
this
difference
that
they
are
now
being
permitted
to
pay
but
they
didn't
pay
that
for
some
two
months
after
the
trial
judge
had
his
hearing.
mr.
jacob
l.
morewitz
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
suggest
your
honor
that
the
articles
are
not
here
and
they're
quoting
from
it
and
the
ordinary
one
has
a
six
months
termination.
that
is
something
different
from
this
one.
