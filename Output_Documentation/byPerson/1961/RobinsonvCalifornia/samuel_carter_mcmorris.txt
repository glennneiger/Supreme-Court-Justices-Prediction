mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
present
case,
robinson
versus
california,
is
of
challenge
to
and
attack
upon
section
11721
of
the
health
and
safety
code
of
the
state
of
california
essentially
because
we
feel
that
it
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
in
that
it
punishes
a
status
rather
than
an
act
or
omission,
that
it
punishes
an
involuntary
status,
that
it
punishes
a
status
of
physical
and
mental
illness,
that
it
is
vague,
indefinite
and
uncertain
upon
its
face,
that
double
jeopardy
is
inherent
in
any
crime
of
status
and
certainly
in
this
--
the
present
one
and
that
this
statute
is
unwarranted
and
unconstitutional
infringement
upon
the
freedom
of
movement,
that
it
is
ex
post
facto
and
that
it
imposes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
now,
because
our
case
is
essentially
an
attack
upon
the
law
itself,
the
most
crucial
fact
we
have
before
us
is
the
nature
and
the
content
or
the
necessary
and
implicit
application
of
this
law.
however,
because
we
have
--
aside
or
collateral
issue
or
a
secondary
issue
challenge
also
the
search
and
seizure
aspect
of
this
case
under
the
rule
of
memphis,
ohio,
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
and
because
we
also
feel
that
under
thompson
versus
city
of
louisville,
there
is
an
adequate
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction
or
in
fact
no
evidence
at
all
and
hence
a
denial
of
due
process.
the
facts
of
the
case
will
begin
with
the
arrest
itself.
on
a
chilly
or
cold
night
in
february
of
1960,
the
present
appellant
was
riding
as
a
passenger
in
the
backseat
of
a
car
accompanied
by
his
lady
friend
and
other
party
named
banks
and
his
wife
were
in
the
front
seat,
banks
being
the
driver.
the
arresting
officers
testified
that
they
stopped
the
vehicle
because
of
an
absence
of
rear
license
plate
illumination.
we
feel
that
the
facts
as
testified
by
the
arresting
officers,
negative
of
their
excuse
for
the
stoppage
and
that
they
actually
presented
three
or
four
different
reasons.
secondly,
we
said
that
there
was
a
car
that
driving
slowly
upon
a
dark
unlit
street
and
finally
that
they
--
that
their
--
the
territory
in
question
had
a
reputation
for
person
action
and
--
interesting
also
that
these
officers
were
not
traffic
officers,
though
their
original
justification,
the
one
accepted
by
the
court
was
a
traffic
stopping.
they
were
not
traffic
officers.
they're
not
in
a
traffic
car.
no
citation
for
the
traffic
violation
was
given.
nothing
was
said
to
the
--
to
any
party
about
driving
too
slowly,
and
this
is
admitted.
and
as
soon
as
the
stopping
took
place,
they
began
actually
a
search
of
the
parties
involved
to
see
if
they
were
narcotic
addicts
of
which,
they
had
no
indication
prior
to
the
stopping
of
the
vehicle.
so,
since
they
were
felony
officers
and
were
not
traffic
officers
though
we
--
we
do
not
question
the
right
of
any
officer
to
make
a
traffic
stopping
or
arrest.
since
they
were
not
traffic
officers
and
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
traffic
and
stopping
the
car,
we
suspect
that
we
have
here
the
typical
arrest,
aroused
arrest
for
the
purpose
of
search
to
find
whatever
they
might
have
found.
in
fact,
one
of
the
officers
testified
that
when
the
driver
banks
got
out
of
the
car,
he
shined
his
light
about
this
person
to
find
whatever
he
could
find.
and
this
of
course
is
an
admission
of
a
general
ex
--
search
to
see
what
evidence
of
any
crime
might
have
been
there
present.
but
leave
that
as
it
may,
upon
the
stopping,
banks
left
his
vehicle
and
--
and
met
the
officer
halfway.
and
at
this
point,
although
it
was
a
cold
night
of
february
and
even
of
course
the
california
nights
are
cold
generally,
certain
in
the
month
of
february,
this
--
this
young
man
obligingly
had
his
--
no
jacket
on
and
his
shirt
sleeves
rolled
up
so
the
arresting
officer
could
see
a
single
mark
upon
one
of
his
arms,
the
right
or
the
left
as
the
case
may
have
been.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
it
was
the
driver.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
not
the
petitioner.
based
upon
the
seeing
of
this
single
mark,
the
officers
made
an
arrest.
and
then
having
made
an
arrest,
they
ordered
the
other
three
occupants
from
the
car,
searched
the
car
and
then
searched
the
three
other
occupants.
in
the
case
of
the
present
appellant,
they
had
him
take
off
his
jacket,
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
then
went
about
him
with
their
--
with
their
flashlight.
they
state,
they
also
checked
his
eyes
comparing
it
with
one
with
the
partner,
the
other
officer.
this
was
denied
by
the
appellant
that
his
eye
was
so
shady.
but
any
rate
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
all
on
the
street,
yes,
public
street
of
--
of
the
city
of
los
angeles.
and
--
so
after
having
talked
to
the
appellant,
he
had
said
that
he
admitted
having
used
heroin
some
time
in
the
past.
and
several
weeks
ago
or
at
least
several
days
ago
or
previous
wednesday
and
he
denied
the
admission
but
--
but
they
state
that
he
did
admit
having
used
heroin
upon
at
least
one
occasion
on
54th
street
in
the
city
of
los
angeles.
and
--
so,
based
upon
this
admission
plus
having
seen
scar
tissue
in
--
in
the
arms
of
this
appellant
after
having
ordered
to
remove
him
his
coat,
he,
like
banks,
was
also
arrested
and
charged
with
--
with
the
offense
of
being
a
user
under
the
influence
of
or
addicted
to
the
--
the
drug
in
question
or
--
or
a
narcotic
drug,
the
--
the
actual
which
we
granted.
now,
the
testimony,
the
only
testimony
on
the
trial
which
showed
or
intended
to
show
any
narcotic
use
at
all
was
on
a
police
officer
who
was
attempted
to
be
qualified
as
expert.
the
respondent
says
he
was
clearly
qualified
as
an
expert.
but
because
narcotics
addiction
is
what
is,
that's
a
serious
question
in
my
mind
as
whether
or
not
a
police
officer
has
distinguished
from
a
doctor
or
nurse
or
something
of
a
medical
nature
is
--
is
ever
really
qualified
to
tell
whether
a
person
is
a
narcotic
addict
or
not.
this
of
course
is
--
is
a
question
of
arguable
thing.
we
cert
--
we
don't
rely
upon
it.
but
the
only
evidence
was
that
of
a
police
officer
who
stated
that
this
appellant
was
not
under
the
influence,
was
not
an
addict
as
far
as
he
could
see
and
he
relies
solely
upon
the
use
as
shown
by
some
marks
on
the
man's
arm.
now,
of
course,
the
marks
themselves
are
stated
to
have
been
from
3
to
about
20
days
old
from
one
arm
from
3
to
10
days
and
other
arm
15
to
20
days
as
i
recall
it.
of
course,
the
appearance
of
the
marks
in
the
arms
could
not
show
where
the
narcotic
had
been
injected.
and
of
course,
we
have
the
rule
of
venue.
i
think
generally
certain
in
california
on
the
case
that
we
have
cited
that
venue
or
the
place
where
a
crime
was
committed
whether
its
murder
or
the
injection
of
a
narcotic
must
be
shown.
so
the
expert
did
not
rely
upon
either
influence
or
addiction.
the
court
nevertheless
instructed
upon
it
and
admittedly
unproven
aspect
of
the
law,
addiction
as
well
as
upon
use.
so
we
here
have
a
conviction,
we
did
not
show
clearly
to
have
been
either
for
use
or
for
addiction.
we
know
this
more
than
the
other,
we
must
assume
so
because
the
court
did
instruct
the
jury
that
they
must
all
find
either
use
or
addiction
and
not
six
days
that
he
was
user
and
the
other
six
that
he
was
an
addict.
we
cannot
know
which
it
was
the
jury
found
since
the
prosecution
did
not
elect
between
the
two
of
the
several
counts
of
section
11721.
and
so
we
--
we
must
of
course
challenge
the
--
the
conviction
under
both
grounds
since
--
since
the
--
we
have
no
such
election.
so
then
the
--
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
place
of
use
except
an
admission
on
the
part
of
the
--
the
appellant
himself
who
denied
the
admission
but
it
was
said
by
the
officer
to
have
state
that
he
used
heroin
at
his
arrest
and
--
and
while
he
was
being
interrogated
by
the
investigating
officer
that
he
had
used
heroin
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
sometime
before.
this
was,
of
course,
a
completed
crime
not
in
the
presence
of
the
officers
and
that
it
took
place
on
wednesday
prior
to
the
--
to
the
arrest.
so
that
is
essentially
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
arrest,
and
the
evidence
introduced.
the
appellant
denied
that
he
ever
used
narcotics
explain
marks
all
over
his
body,
having
been
occasion
by
oversea
shots
which
never
got
over.
the
young
lady
with
him
and
he
both
stated
that
banks
had
a
jacket
on
and
he
was
forced
to
remove
his
jacket
the
same
as
--
as
of
this
--
this
appellant
had
been
and
that
his
mother
also
testified
explaining
the
marks
all
over
his
body,
jury
to
show
that
he
had
marks
on
his
back
and
chest
and
breast
places
and
not
just
on
his
arms
of
a
dark
splotches
which
he
--
which
he
testified
with
the
same
as
though
in
his
arms.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
the
--
he
revealed,
he
took
his
shirt
off
and
showed
the
jury,
he
had
dark
splotches
all
over
his
body,
not
just
in
his
arms
and
places
where
others,
he
first
wouldn't
be
taking
narcotics.
and
it
was
no
claim
these
others
were
narcotic
marks
but
were
in
generally
in
evidence.
and
the
jury
had
acquired
a
magnifying
glass
before
they
could
be
satisfied
that
the
marks
have
shown
in
the
pit
of
the
arms
wherein
fact
narcotic
marks.
however,
his
marks
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
i'm
sorry.
yes,
sir?
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes,
this
was
a
friday.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
that
was
friday
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes,
at
least
that.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well
mr.
justice
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
stewart.
as
to
--
as
to
the
influence,
the
court
exp
--
expressly
rejected
that
and
that
it
was
--
the
court
expressly
charged
the
jury
that
it
was
not
influence,
no
influence
has
shown.
it
had
to
be
either
addiction
or
use.
the
court
did
instruct
as
to
those
two
aspects
of
three
prolonged
statute.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
addiction
or
use.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes,
there
was
admission
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
--
before
the
jury.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
that
is
true
mr.
justice.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
no,
it
could
be
either
way.
the
court
simply
instructed
that
they
had
to
go
all
one
way
or
the
other,
not
divide
as
between
the
two
aspects
of
the
law
which
is
charged
this
point.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes,
it
is.
it
is.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
only
problem
is
that
that
the
judge
fully
instructed
the
jury
upon
--
upon
addiction,
so
we're
on
the
haunt
of
this
dilemma
--
of
this
dilemma.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
we
don't
know
of
which
we
are
addicted.
so
of
course
i
have
to
challenge
both
possible
convictions.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
argue
strongly
at
the
trial
and
the
transcript
here
that
even
the
--
they
had
not
contend
basically
that
they
had
shown
the
addiction
and
yet
we
are
--
and
i
challenge
the
instruction
on
that
ground
which
was
given
nonetheless.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
no,
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
or
--
or
a
withdrawal
symptoms
as
i
argue
that
--
no
showing
of
it
all.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
no,
he
simply
stated
that
he
had
oversea
shots
and
this
led
to
a
general
marking
upon
his
body
of
dark
splotches
which
changed
color
in
the
light
and
in
the
dark.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
with
narcotics
and
such
as
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
--
as
far
as
--
as
far
as
it
show.
so
that's
been,
as
i
recall,
consist
--
is
a
fact
of
the
case.
now,
because
of
the
instruction
of
the
court
under
addiction
--
had
the
court
not
instruct
yet
on
addiction,
i
would
not
have
my
basic
approach
here
today,
although
i'm
happy
if
the
court
did
so.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'd
be
willing
to
--
to
abandon
or
waive
or
withdraw
from
my
arguments
under
points
b
and
--
and
c
regarding
the
procedural
denial
of
due
process
with
respect
to
insufficiency
of
evidence
and
respect
to
the
search
and
seizure.
because
to
me,
the
crux
of
this
case
is
the
conviction
underneath
the
narcotic
law
which
makes
narcotic
addiction
a
crime.
now,
it
is
interesting
that
in
only
four
of
the
states
of
the
union
as
we
point
out
from
material
from
the
alternative
price
annuals
reports,
only
four
of
the
states
in
the
union
punished
narcotics
addiction
exclusively
as
a
crime.
in
a
large
number
of
states,
approximately
ten,
it
is
punished
solely
as
a
sickness.
in
the
others,
it
is
punished
or
it
is
treat,
let
me
say
or
--
or
treated
as
a
sickness
or
punished
as
a
crime.
so
the
general
approach
is
and
in
california
surely,
it
maybe
approached
either
of
the
crime
or
under
the
welfare
and
institutions
code,
a
party
maybe
placed
in
a
state
hospital
of
some
kind
and
treated
as
a
narcotics
addict.
we
have
no
objection
to
such
treatment
in
a
voluntary
compulsory
and
we
feel
that
this
is
the
proper
approach.
we
feel
the
legislature
in
this
law
took
not
just
a
why
but
certainly
a
constitutional
step.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
here
a
law
which
punishes
out
a
crime
the
same
status
or
condition
which
another
law
of
california
treats
as
a
sickness.
in
the
first
place,
i
might
say
in
passing
that
it
seems
to
me
that
those
who
are
treated
under
the
punishment
aspect
are
denied
equal
protection
as
against
those
who
are
given
the
treatment
under
the
welfare
and
institutions
code,
which
is
purely
a
medical
and
psychiatric
sort
of
thing.
but
getting
to
my
first
major
point
under
this
that
any
statute
which
punishes
a
status
as
distinguished
from
an
act
or
omission
is
unconstitutional.
at
this
point,
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
an
excellent
article
vagrancy
reconsidered
which
appears
in
the
new
york
law
review,
the
most
recent
volume,
it's
--
it's
in
one
of
the
--
the
--
this
--
in
the
january
of
this
year's
edition,
vagrancy
reconsidered
by
--
by
the
new
york
university
law
review
which
points
out
an
answer
up
to
the
contention,
though
not
intended
to
be
an
answer
to
the
contends
of
the
respondent
who
holds
that
both
england
and
america
have
always
accepted
status
as
a
proper
ground
for
penalization,
that
the
only
basis
of
a
survival,
the
vagrancy
laws
in
california
and
of
course
as
we'll
point
out
later,
this
present
law
is
a
type
of
vagrancy
law.
the
only
ground
for
a
survival
has
been
two
centuries
of
uncritical
acceptance
by
our
legislatures
and
courts
of
outmoded
english
precedent
which
has
been
rejected
by
england
itself.
and
this
is
fully
pointed
out
in
this
article
which
i
mentioned
that
england
no
longer
has
a
vagrancy
statute.
they
have
evolved
from
vagrancy
to
--
to
conduct,
to
disorderly
conduct
which
is
what
california
in
our
most
recent
legislature
changed
to
and
illinois
at
the
same
time.
we
know
have
two
states
but
i
think
would
start
up
--
would
become
a
trend
to
get
away
from
punishing
the
condition
and
punish
specific
acts
of
the
inherent
wrongness
of
punishing
a
person's
condition
or
status
is
that
we
are
here
punishing
the
possibility
of
crime,
is
suspected
intent
to
commit
crime,
even
not
an
attempt
or
an
act.
normally,
throughout
our
history
or
in
--
in
most
laws
everywhere,
a
person
who's
convicted
of
crime
if
he
does
a
thing
or
attempts
to
do
a
thing.
we
go
beyond
the
actual
completion
and
do
punish
the
attempt.
at
the
same
time,
we
have
a
constitutional
mandate
against
even
an
arrest
on
suspicion
merit.
but
the
vagrancy
laws
of
which
this
is
one
permits
a
police
officer
not
just
to
arrest
upon
suspicion
or
because
a
person
might
intend
to
commit
a
crime
because
of
his
vagrant
status
but
he
can
even
be
convicted
upon
suspicion.
so
we
have
just
--
and
the
antithesis
or
antithesis
of
the
--
of
our
search
and
seizure
rule
which
forbids
an
arrest
except
in
the
presence
of
an
actual
crime
or
--
or
proper
suspicion
there
as.
here,
we
have
a
conviction
for
the
suspicion
itself.
now,
under
california
law,
it
is
time
honor
under
section
20
of
the
penal
code
that
we
must
show
either
act
or
omission
plus
intent.
so
here,
we
have
neither
act
n4or
omission
and
we
submit
no
intent.
in
that
under
0.2,
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
wholly
involuntary
status.
now,
the
respondent
assures
the
court
that
every
addict
intends
to
become
an
addict.
however,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
an
addict
no
more
intended
to
become
that
than
does
an
alcoholic
intend
to
become
an
alcoholic
because
he
may
have
like
to
drink
socially
or
because
the
person
intended
to
acquire
venereal
disease
because
he
may
have
voluntarily
committed
some
other
act
contrary
to
our
--
to
the
laws
of
a
sexual
morality.
the
point
i'm
getting
at
is
in
--
these
three
things
are
--
are
similar.
the
--
a
person
intends
to
take
a
drink,
intends
perhaps
to
take
shot
of
heroin
or
smoke
a
marijuana
cigarette
or
intends
to
have
an
illicit
sex
act.
none
of
these
intended
to
acquire
venereal
disease
or
to
become
an
alcoholic
or
to
become
an
addict.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
intent
does
not
go
beyond
the
initial
voluntary
act
which
is
not
the
status
which
--
which
comes
from
the
repeated
series,
perhaps
the
voluntary
acts.
no
one,
i
submit,
intends
to
become
an
addict.
and
i
think
this
is
clear
from
our
medical
discussion
which
we
have
and
present
here
the
authorities,
both
from
europe,
dr.
hesse
or
hesse,
a
renowned
german
physician
and
two
american
authorities,
american
doctors
mower
and
(inaudible)
and
it
is
uncontradicted
that
we
do
have
a
peer,
a
condition
of
mental
and
physical
illness.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
respondent
admits
or
the
appellee
admits
that
this
is
a
mental
and
physical
illness
and
then
goes
on
to
say,
however
we
may
punish.
the
statement
properly
punish
a
mental
and
physical
illness
and
compares
it
with
--
with
alcoholism
or
--
or
drunkenness
let's
say
which
--
which
appellee
says
he'd
be
punished,
compares
it
also
with
kleptomania,
the
sickness
requiring
one
to
steal
and
with
the
arsonist
who
may
be
ill
as
distinguished
from
one
or
perhaps
he's
burning
his
house
to
collect
insurance.
i
--
in
a
recent
speech
by
the
judge
mirto
of
the
new
york
bench
and
california
in
--
in
san
francisco
under
a
conference
he
had
at
a
baffle
time
this
court
granted
this
appeal
in
this
case
in
november
of
last
year,
they
had
a
conference
on
alcohol
and
american
civilization.
judge
mirto
stated
that
he
feels
that
to
treat
alcoholics
as
criminals
is
not
only
contrary
to
good
social
policy
but
it's
unconstitutional
and
made
with
respect
to
alcohol
to
the
point
of
drunkenness,
the
same
contest
that
which
we
are
making
here
with
respect
to
narcotics
addiction.
we
of
course
hardly
agree
with
the
judge
and
feel
that
--
that
a
recent
development
in
our
history
of
our
jurisprudence
in
this
development
will
be
that
even
certain
things
as
kleptomania
and
arson
or
whatever,
if
it
can
be
shown
to
be
actually
the
product
of
mental
illness
as
distinguished
from
a
voluntary
act
will
be
an
illness
to
be
treated
so
and
not
a
crime.
our
jails
are
overcrowded
with
people
who
voluntarily
and
under
their
own
control
have
done
such
thing
as
commit
arson
or
rob,
and
such
people
properly
belong
there.
but
if
a
person
does
in
fact
commit
the
act
of
theft
or
an
act
of
arson
or
any
act
because
of
a
--
a
probably
medical
condition
such
person,
i
think,
should
be
treated
and
not
punished
and
certainly
in
the
case
of
alcoholism
or
a
narcotics
addiction
even
more
so
than
the
--
than
--
than
the
other
categories
perhaps
because
these
are
clearly
and
totally
mental
and
physical
illnesses
which
--
which
cry
out
loud
for
help,
for
treatment,
for
hospitalization
rather
than
for
--
for
the
type
of
punishment
which
--
which
we
here
apply.
now,
we
are
not
alone
and
respondent
assures
the
court,
appellee
assures
the
court
that
we
cannot
--
have
not
present
any
case
in
which
status
has
been
held
not
a
proper
subject
for
legislation.
however,
in
the
case,
the
belcrasto
--
belcrasto
case
from
new
york,
people
versus
the
belcastro
which
is
cited
by
both
sides,
the
court
throughout
a
gangster
type
vagrancy
statute,
the
new
york
court
because
it
held
that
this
was
unconstitutional.
in
lanzetta
versus
new
jersey,
this
present
court
took
the
same
approach
to
a
new
jersey
statute.
recently
in
california,
our
state
supreme
court
in
the
newbern,
the
famous,
now
famous
newbern
case
throughout
the
common
drunkard
section
of
our
vagrancy
laws
which
is
point
11
and
--
of
which
--
the
law
of
which
narcotics
addiction
was
originally
point
12.
originally,
this
law
was
a
part
of
our
vagrancy
law
and
was
later
deleted
and
put
in
the
health
and
safety
code
as
a
specialized
vagrancy
ordinance
that
give
a
specialized
treatment.
the
vagrancy
or
status
aspects
remain.
but
in
--
in
newbern
and
california,
section
11
of
647
of
the
--
of
the
penal
code
which
in
1961
was
changed
from
vagrancy
to
disorderly
conduct,
the
appellee,
will
all
the
sudden
completely
solve
the
problem
i
think.
the
court
held
that
the
terms
common
drunkard
was
too
big,
indefinite
and
uncertain
to
constitute
valid
penal
legislation.
one
of
the
ground
given
was
that
the
degree
of
drunkenness
as
i
recall
the
--
that
the
legislature
had
in
mind
was
not
clear
from
the
terms
common
drunkard.
and
under
our
heading
that
the
present
law
is
vague,
indefinite
and
uncertain,
we
make
a
similar
holding
with
respect
to
addict.
and
certainly,
the
term
"addict"
of
all
our
three
terms
which
are
use
one,
two
be
under
the
influence
of
and
three,
be
addicted
to
a
narcotic.
all
three
are
subject
to
--
to
disagreement
among
reasonable
minds
particular
with
respect
to
--
to
addict.
consider
this,
the
legislature
in
--
in
a
section
of
the
health
and
safety
code
which
we
cite
by
typographical
error,
we
had
it
wrong
and
the
appellee
was
kind
of
give
the
court
the
--
the
correct
section.
the
legislature
of
california
has
legislated
that
a
--
an
addicted
person
is
one
who
has
a
compulsion
to
use
a
substance,
which
to
me
is
the
only
proper
definition
of
an
addiction
as
distinguished
from
habitual
use
or
a
single
use.
in
other
words,
not
merely
habit
or
custom
but
a
compulsion,
a
physical
compulsion
which
is
explained
by
the
doctors,
"as
actually
such
a
physiological
changed
that
the
body
will
not
function
normally
in
the
absence
of
the
substance
of
a
narcotic.
when
you
reach
this
part,
you
have
a
clearly
disorganized
body
which
if
it
has
a
--
in
a
proper
withdrawal
may
collapse
or
even
die
and
this
is
the
kind
of
treatment
we
get
in
the
cold
turkey
california
penal
treatment
of
narcotics
addiction
which
every
doctor
quoted
here
and
certainly
generally
state
must
be
given
medical
treatment
or
--
and
a
hospital
situation,
a
general
taping
off
or
a
deep
sleep
treatment
or
the
application
of
methadone
in
order
not
to
have
to
go
through
this
terrible
violent
withdrawal
which
we
feel
is
such
abstinence
of
the
application
of
what
we
know
about
the
medicine
psychiatry
that
it
is
in
fact
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
for
the
condition
of
addiction
which
a
person
is
found.
now
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
everyday.
it's
constantly.
in
fact,
this
is
the
third
such
case
i
had
in
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well
in
this
case,
it
was
taken
there
by
way
of
writ
--
of
prohibition
of
habeas
corpus
and
they
denied
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
they
have
never
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
to
my
recollection,
the
california
supreme
court
has
never
rendered
the
case
decision.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well
as
a
practical
matter,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
police
officers
know
these
people
and
every
time
they
see
them,
they
rousted
around
and
if
they
see
any
evidence
of
a
mark
or
these
old
scars,
they
are
likely
to
go
right
back
in.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
there
are
cases
in
which
--
which
i
personally
familiar
and
some
which
i
have
handled
because
i
have
handled
a
great
number
of
narcotics
cases
but
i
don't
have
the
--
the
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
no,
i
don't
have
it
here.
no,
i
don't
have
it
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
but
this
is
the
kind
in
which
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well
in
our
state,
we
do
have
this
in
our
constitution
as
--
as
a
plea.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
no,
it
has
--
it
has
never
been
in
fact
made
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well,
i
would
be
using
the
same
colloquy
because
i
was
in
los
angeles
county.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes
mr.
brennan.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
no.
at
that
time,
i
didn't
because
i
was
newer
in
the
field.
this
is
--
i
gradually
evolved
or
developed
in
--
into
my
approach
into
this
plea.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well
as
a
practical
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
--
the
officers
will
have
or
will
say
to
have
a
fresh
mark
so
that
although
the
person
is
to
punish
for
the
continuing
of
--
of
continuing
addiction
--
addiction,
actually,
there
is
some
evidence
of
continued
use.
but
if
--
but
my
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
--
contention
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes,
but
my
contention
is
that
--
that
their
--
as
indicated
by
the
--
by
the
appellee,
they're
really
trying
to
get
addiction
conviction
because
it's
hard
to
prove
use
or
influence
so
as
a
practical
matter.
it
is
so
likely
the
vagrancy
where
we
have
to
prove
the
condition
by
a
single
act
that
proving
the
condition
of
addiction
by
another
mark
in
the
same
spot
where
a
person
was
previously
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
on
the
trial
as
i
point
out
in
my
--
in
my
brief,
on
the
trial,
on
motion
for
new
trial,
on
my
appeal
to
the
--
to
the
appellant
as
part
of
the
superior
court?
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes,
i
try
to
find
it
quickly
here.
on
page
6
of
my
brief,
opening
brief,
i
state
that
--
that
i
made
a
motion
for
new
trial.
the
trial
there
will
specify
all
the
grounds
here
brought
before
this
court
which
is
this
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
the
motion
should
be
a
part
of
the
record
of
the
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
no,
the
--
the
court
will
find
my
argument
throughout
the
--
throughout
the
transcripts
of
record
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
no,
they
haven't
--
make
no
such
contention.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
appellant
from
the
supreme
court
clearly
recognized
it
in
the
state
of
a
higher
courts
and
it
is
also
determined
the
question
and
point
out
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
is
the
only
appeal
we
have
in
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
no,
it
is
an
appeal.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
it
is
an
appeal.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
it
is
clearly
an
appeal.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
from
the
--
this
court
on
the
record
--
the
municipal
court.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
not
at
all.
this
is
an
appeal,
a
standard
appeal.
and
it's
a
higher
state
court
in
which
the
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
but
we
can't
go
by
habeas
corpus
prohibition
or
certiorari
other
--
other
roots
to
the
higher
courts
as
i
did
in
this
case
to
leave
no
stone
unturned.
have
we
had
a
previous
experience
in
lambert
versus
california
not
done
so
and
the
court
has
its
justice.
so
--
now,
the
--
ex
po
--
ex
post
facto
aspect,
the
appellee
contends
that
as
to
our
particular
appellant,
we
do
not
show
that
the
law
was
ex
post
facto.
we
feel,
however,
that
once
having
challenge
a
statute
squarely
as
applied
tools
a
particular
appellant,
the
such
appellant
may
then
show
the
entire
scope
of
the
laws
and
the
constitutional
standpoint.
and
this
is
the
holding
of
the
implied
boarding
of
thornhill
versus
alabama
and
lanzetta
versus
new
jersey
and
that
we
did
not
have
here
a
just
moot
case,
we
had
a
case
in
which
as
the
law
was
in
fact
applied
to
this
appellant
and
which
it
did
go
beyond
its
actual
application
to
show
what
the
law
consisted
of
upon
its
face.
this
ex
post
facto
aspect
occurs
on
the
face
of
the
law.
and
that
it
punishes
person
whatever
addiction
and
clearly
because
of
the
change
in
our
--
in
our
approach
to
a
narcotics
addiction
within
the
lifetime
of
most
of
us
or
many
of
us
and
because
it
was
legal
and
because
there
is
no
known
cure
for
it,
there
--
there
are
many
who
will
be
subjected
to
this
particular
law
who
either
acquired
the
condition
which
we
know
not
--
not
how
to
treat
prior
to
the
law
or
who
may
have
been
even
acquired
during
the
war
with
many
of
our
voyage
did
acquire
and
appellate
going
to
overseas
having
to
take
narcotics
injected
from
an
area
and
other
things.
it
then
become
a
criminal
automatically
and
it
will
come
out
in
uniform
and
to
state
of
life.
and
this
kind
of
thing
seems
to
be
is
ex
post
facto.
i
repeat,
again,
that
i
feel
that
the
cold
turkey
treatment
which
is
a
necessary
and
adherence
approach
under
--
under
the
penal
treatment
of
this
--
of
this
condition
which
leaves
an
addict
to
suffer
and
nearly
die
and
sometime
in
fact
die.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes.
and
there
have
been
many
cases,
no
one
--
in
which
person
have
--
has
died
because
i
personally
know
of
in
--
in
los
angeles.
and
in
every
case,
they
suffer
untold
agony
which
all
happy,
we
could
make
judicial
notice
of,
have
which
could
be
tapered
off
or
it
could
even
a
deep
sleep
treatment
or
they
get
tapered
off
or
they
can
given
some
other
drug
so
that
they
will
at
least
become
their
physical
selves
again
without
having
to
suffer
solidarity
as
--
as
they
do.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well,
and
--
and
as
those
steps
the
--
these
were
extra
ordinary
remedies
and
not
in
the
usual
rule
of
appeal.
they're
extraordinary
writ.
habeas
corpus
i
think
as
a
provision
habeas
corpus
of
certiorari
and
mandate
of
different
ways
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
albeit,
in
spite
by
both
parties
simply
as
a
--
as
a
decision
of
the
court
and
--
and
we
do
have
the
citation
that
it
was
--my
motion
was
denied
without
comments
as
to
the
appellate
--
as
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
and
of
california
supreme
court
in
which
i
raised
very
brief
i
have
here
essentially
was
presented
to
those
two
levels
of
court
as
it
have
been
to
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
and
based
on
the
--
dismissed
it
without
counting
and
--
and
because
the
time
that
not
run
from
my
appeal
to
the
--
to
appeal
from
the
appellate
department
and
because
it
is
a
higher
state
court
to
which
i
could
take
an
appeal
undistinguishable
in
the
next
door
and
a
remedy,
i
therefore
appeal
in
this
court
haven't
given
the
california
courts
its
opportunity
to
consider
having
it
desire.
i
couldn't
appeal
to
them
but
i
did.
it
goes
to
the
matter
i
could
by
a
way
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
or
provision.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
at
present
time?
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes,
at
that
--
at
that
time,
he
--
he
began
to
service
sentence.
i
filed
habeas
corpus
writ
in
the
two
levels
of
state
court,
all
the
way
to
top.
and
by
then
--
then
he
was
out
on
--
on
probation.
and
it's
done
in
--
while
on
probation
subjected
to
the
naline
testing
program
in
which
we
--
they
inject
chemical
naline
say
in
passing
in
order
to
see
if
a
person
has
resumed
using
the
drug.
and
at
that
point,
when
i
actually
repeal
to
this
court,
he
was
on
probation
but
still
subject
--
subject
to
the
punishment
of
--
i
mentioned
both
the
--
for
two
years
under
control
probation
officer
and
--
and
subjected
to
the
naline
testing
program.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
he's
still
on
probation
at
this
time.
i
think
that
completes
my
fully
argument
if
there
are
no
questions
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
i
think
it's
section
11
that
would
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
chapter
--
sorry.
chapter
11
which
is
exclusively
a
treatment
thing
which
is
what
i
recommend
and
urged,
an
argue
is
the
only
not
of
--
not
--
it's
not
on
a
policy
but
the
only
proper
constitutional
approach
of
this
particular
problem.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
i
don't
believe
so,
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
this
--
or
a
new
--
a
new
chapter
11.
but
it
is
--
as
i
said,
though
it
doesn't
define
it
which
isn't
too
important
perhaps
--
though
somewhat
in
the
case
of
a
civil
or
medical
treatment
but
here
--
here
in
the
court,
there's
definition
aspect
too.
here,
we
can
see
or
read
my
mind
may
be
different.
now,
mr.
doran
i've
known
for
years
is
a
reasonable
man
but
he
insists
that
we
can
have
addiction
without
compulsion.
i
like
to
thank
him
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
without
compulsion,
just
to
have
it
without
the
compulsive
use,
throughout
the
driving
force
to
use.
that's
the
contention
he's
making
here
that
--
this
was
construction
legislature
that
addiction
means
habitual
customary
use
as
distinguished
from
compulsive
use.
i
think
there's
a
distinction
there.
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
break
it
down
further.
i
cite
in
my
brief
two
new
york
cases,
the
application
of
palmer
and
palmer
against
spaulding.
spaulding,
i
think
the
same
man
palmer.
in
one
case,
a
new
york
court
stated
that
you
must
show
compulsive
use
plus
an
actual
deterioration
upon
the
body.
i
think
this
has
to
do
with
the
doctor
who
was
being
disqualified
because
he
was
deteriorated
while
using
the
drug
himself.
another
case
held
that
the
mere
compulsion
without
a
showing
of
deterioration
is
all
that
you
had
to
show.
so
here
another
court,
we
have
the
same
conflict,
we
have
in
california
here
between
the
legislature
of
the
courts
because
i
insist
that
the
california
legislature
in
its
only
definition
of
addiction
has
said
compulsive
or
beyond
the
power
of
control.
this
is
the
only
definition
we
have
--
in
--
is
our
legislature
i
think
it's
what
they
mean.
and
that's
what
california
legislature
says
an
addict
is.
here,
we
have
a
court
reading
on
a
new
definition
in
--
in
the
case
cited,
it
was
in
--
in
a
vehicle
code
thing
saying,
well,
i
know
what
the
purpose
of
this
code.
well,
the
legislature
does
not
define
it
and
to
another
court,
they
do
define
it
and
say
we
--
it
means
compulsive
use
or
use
beyond
the
control.
we
will
say
that
for
this
purpose
of
this
code,
it
--
it
means
only
habitual
customary
use
and
this
shows
the
conflict
i
suspect
within
the
reasonable
minds
of
the
judiciary
and
the
legislature.
now,
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
use
of
the
--
of
the
term
"use".
mr.
doran,
a
reasonable
man
feels
that
a
single
use
of
--
of
a
narcotic
is
sufficient.
i
think
the
legislature
meant
a
customary
use.
but
here
again,
the
dictionary,
webster
has
both
of
them
as
meanings
for
the
term
"use".
so
here
again,
we
have
a
conflict.
and
as
for
the
use
beyond
the
influence
of
aspect,
we
have
the
newbern
rule
that
just
as
the
common
was
undefinable
so
--
and
also
because
the
legislature
did
not
show
to
what
extent
they
have
in
mind
with
reference
to
--
to
what
extent
drug
has
became
common
or
what
point
it
became
common.
as
to
addiction,
we
don't
know
what
the
legislature
has
in
mind,
as
to
what
degree.
i
would
subject
you
to
this
felony
of
whether
or
not
they
--
so
either
they
had
in
mind
their
own
definition
in
the
welfare
and
institutions
code
which
is
a
compulsive
or
use
beyond
control
which
is
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
not
at
all.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
just
to
a
common
jail,
never
to
a
hospital.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
he
may
but
i've
never
known
of
the
case,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i've
known
many
case
of
the
kicking
a
cold
turkey
back
then
in
the
cell
and
we
have
moved
him
and
everything
else
to
this
respect.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
i
think
there's
new
one
which
come
out
in
1961.
it
provides
to
something
that's
highly
different.
we've
always
had
the
power
to
treat
them
in
hospital
but
we
never
used,
but
please
put
them
in
jail.
the
one's
who
are
enforcing
the
narcotics
law
in
california
are
the
police
not
the
doctors.
we
have
a
medical
fact
that
if
treatment
we
have
a
penal
but
the
one
which
prosecution
represented
here
by
appellee
is
used
for
the
penal.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
i've
never
known
it
to
be
done.
i've
never
done,
never
known
any
other
counsel
has
done
it.
they're
given
a
criminal
treatment
and
to
some,
the
civil
thing
has
just
not
been
used
of
whether
or
not
under
our
new
laws
1961,
it
will
used,
i
do
not
know.
i
suspect
if
we
knock
out
this
law,
it
will
be
used
because
if
we
know
anything
(inaudible)
now,
i
think
it's
a
good
thing,
the
compulsive.
medical
aside
getting
treatment
but
treatment
of
these
people
and
the
only
way
california
will
ever
be
required
to
use
that
law
is
to
tell
them
we
cannot
just
let
them
kick
it
cold
turkey
as
you
have
the
other
provision
here.
this
is
--
it's
an
unreasonable
transportation
to
these
people
when
you
have
a
medical
--
hospital
here,
the
jail
over
here,
those
in
jail
are
not
being
properly
treated,
i
suspect.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
what?
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
it
has
done
so
since
about
37
of
thereabouts.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
it
is
--
i'm
sorry.
it
is
a
definition
in
connection
--
the
welfare
institution
code
definition,
it
connects
it
with
civil
or
medical
treatment.
in
the
penal
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well,
i
think
it
does
apply
for
two
reasons.
first
place,
the
legislature
does
not
define
it
in
--
in
the
penal
code.
and
it
does
define
it
in
the
other
code.
and
secondly,
when
--
when
the
law
was
originally
passed
as
a
part
of
the
penal
code,
it
did
define
it
in
the
same
manner.
as
it's
shown
by
my
--
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief,
the
original
passage
of
this
law
had
--
from
a
court
because
it
shows
my
point
so
well,
the
original
vagrancy
or
--
or
narcotics
addict
law
in
california
read
as
follows,
"provided
that
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
it's
on
page
50
of
--
of
the
opening
brief,
"provided
that
a
drug
addict
within
the
meaning
of
this
section
as
any
person
who
habitually
takes
or
otherwise
use
narcotics
except
that
was
such
user
is
suffering
from
incurable
disease
or
accident
or
injury
and
to
whom
such
a
narcotics
are
furnished,
prescribe
a
medicine
in
good
faith
and
in
the
course
of
this
profession,
professional
practice
by
a
position
duly
licensed
in
the
state,
such
persons
will
not
be
held
to
be
a
drug
addict.
now
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes,
it
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well,
as
i
said,
the
california
legislature
does
not
define
it
into
--
into
one
code,
it
does
define
it
in
the
other
code
as
so
exist.
i
just
assume
that
they
went
to
one
definition
to
apply.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well,
that
is
apparently
the
contention
of
the
--
of
the
appellee
that
we
--
we
have
two
different
two
classes
of
addicts.
one
in
--
in
the
welfare
and
institutions
code,
he
go
to
hospital,
he
must
be
under
a
compulsive
use
or
beyond
his
control.
but
under
penal
code
by
the
court's
reading
in
their
own
definition
not
supplied
by
the
legislature,
he
may
just
be
a
habitual
customary
use.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
for
treatment.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
that
would
--
could
happen
under
the
definition
urged
by
--
by
the
--
the
appellee
here.
but
here
again
as
i
said,
since
this
is
--
it's
clearly
showing
of
the
disagreement
among
reasonable
mind
because
we
don't
know
what
the
legislature
had
in
mind.
and
there
--
and
therefore,
the
--
the
law
is
not
complete
in
the
penal
code,
but
it
is
complete
in
the
welfare
and
institution
code.
we
have
to
guess
in
the
penal
code
and
vehicle
code
and
so
the
court
guessed
that
the
legislature
had
in
mind
a
different
definition
on
in
the
one
code.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
it
was
in
the
instruction,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well,
there
was
just
one
count
both
on
the
same
count.
actually
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
--
as
i
thought
they
should
have
been
two
counts.
but
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
--
there
was
a
single
count.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
it
was
at
least
possible
although
the
court
specifically
under
--
under
the
thompson
case
which
i
--
an
appeal
i
won
on
--
on
the
venue
point
in
california,
it
must
now
instruct
the
jury
that
they
must
all
go
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
but
if
they
do
understand
that
instruction
--
we
have
the
one
count.
in
fact,
we
have
all
three
pleaded
in
one
count,
influence,
use
and
addiction.
all
three
had
pleaded
in
one
count.
so
they
considered
one
count
and
whatever
the
court
instructs
them
and
they
could
use
area
here.
i
suspect
they
still
could
go
seek
and
search
this.
well,
the
court
did
in
all
fairness
specifically
instructed
that
they
must
go
all
one
or
the
other.
you
may
have
understood
that.
but
we
don't
know
which
it
was
and
we
don't
know
which
--
which
it
was
under
--
under
the
pleading.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
let
me
see.
(inaudible)
they're
on
page
100
and
informed
by
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
they
begin
on
page
107.
page
103,
we
have
instruction
as
to
the
use
of
addiction.
first
paragraph
of
page
105
apparently
that
all
must
agree
to
the
same
particular
act
or
status
or
condition.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
they
are
combined
without
the
explanation
that
they
could
--
that
they
could
had
to
go
in
one
way
at
that
point.
i
think
it
would
have
helped
to
plea
them
a
separate
counsel.
i've
so
argued
that.
and
i
think
we
have
actually
three
laws
here
and
--
and
yet
the
--
the
counsel
could
have
only
one
count.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes.
and
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
and
i
--
i
don't
recall
whether
--
in
this
case,
i
didn't
make
this
point
as
having
others
that
the
--
that
the
disconfusion.
i
think
i
did
on
the
--
on
the
appeal
to
the
appellate
department.
i
didn't
advanced
it
here
that
they
should
have
almost
certain
did
that
they
should
have
pleaded
separately
but
they
didn't.
i
did
ask
to
request
that
and
argue
it
on
my
first
appeal.
i
don't
argue
it
here.
i
didn't
think
it
was
substantial
enough
frank
--
frankly
before
this
court
but
it
may
have
been.
and
but
--
it
does
in
fact
that
tell
the
jury
they
must
go
one
way
or
the
other
but
still
we
don't
know
which
--
which
it
was
filed.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
yes,
first
paragraph
on
page
105.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
i'd
like
to
answer
too
a
question
earlier
of
mr.
justice
brennan
as
to
whether
or
not
a
person
could
be
presented
up
to
--
the
appellee
could
be
immediately
arrested
in
another
county
or
even
in
the
same
county
under
the
part
of
the
instruction
which
is
scratched
out
here
is
california
law
that
this
status
is
presumed
to
exist
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
the
defendant
to
disprove
this
presumption
which
means
that
if
i
do
three
months
and
get
out
tomorrow,
i
presume
to
continue
to
be
an
addict
and
i
could
be
arrested
when
i
hit
the
streets
even
though
they
may
not
as
a
fact
permitted
to
do
it.
this
count
occur
under
the
law
because
my
condition
is
presumed
to
continue
indefinitely
under
these
instructions
which
are
here
but
scratched
out
because
the
court
found
that
it
didn't
apply
because
they
had
no
previous
conviction
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
no,
it
comes
pretty
close
to
this.
they
see
this
--
it's
the
same
track.
these
tracks
last
a
lifetime
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
when
the
person
used
it
--
the
substance
for
years,
these
tracks
last
for
lifetime
and
at
same
track
and
convict
him
a
thousand
times.
they
don't
have
to
find
the
place
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
this
is
not
at
all
be
acquired
under
the
law.
they
may
or
may
not
be.
and
that
who
can
tell
what
hole
is
new
and
how
long
it
has
been
there,
where
they
got
it.
but
essentially,
it
is
the
track
of
--
that
they
convict
the
addiction
for
the
single
hole
and
as
the
appellee
said
it's
not
addiction.
but
we
have
here
the
track
plus
the
hole
at
any
event.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
and
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
up
to
20
days
mr.
justice
clark.
but
to
--
as
a
practical
manner,
i
mean
as
a
possible
manner
under
the
law
of
the
man
(inaudible)
as
treated
if
he
doesn't
like
it.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
--
court
as
in
other
situation.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
no,
but
it's
on
the
face
of
law.
and
the
interpretation
of
--
of
addiction
by
the
california
court
that
the
condition
presumed
to
exist
which
means
that
--
that
--
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
in
you.
so
if
you
want
show
any
previous
con
--
of
conviction,
you
must
now
show
that
you're
no
longer
an
addict.
and
i
think
this
is
hardly
frivolous
to
california
law.
in
which
why
i
stated
that
it
can't
be
a
thousand
times
punished
for
the
same
condition,
as
distinguished
from
new
marks
though
as
the
practical
matter,
they
--
they
may
wait
for
a
new
mark
but
it's
not
required
under
the
law.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well,
the
--
as
the
state
of
appellee
here,
they
may
not
show
and
--
and
all
they
may
not
show
that
the
condition
continued
over
the
same
period.
in
other
words,
if
--
if
i'm
arrested
today
and
due
in
3
months
--
30
days
or
90
days
which
the
minimum
then
if
i
get
arrested
a
day
after
i
get
out
of
jail,
this
my
addiction
which
continue
after
i
got
out
so
we
have
a
different
cure
but
it's
the
same
of
addiction.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
not
squarely
so
because
this
one,
i
thought
the
judge
did
not
give
these
instructions
and
scratched
it
out
but
my
point
is
on
the
face
of
the
law
in
california
interpretation.
we
have
a
law
which
permits
a
thousand
prosecutions
for
the
same
condition.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
(inaudible)
so
much,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
adherent
things
and
--
and
that
a
condition
if
a
man
robbed
a
bank,
he
has
to
rob
a
bank
again
or
if
he
robbed
a
person,
he
has
to
rob
a
person
again.
here,
we're
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
that
is
true
except
that
it's
not
adherent
in
the
manner
in
which
is
adherent
here
because
he
said
--
we
have
a
presumptions
and
present
in
the
law
that
this
man's
condition
last
a
lifetime,
and
this
is
implicit
in
the
law.
so,
we
don't
have
such
a
presumption
with
rob
--
robbing
a
bank
or
--
or
rape
of
murder
or
arson.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
that
is
true
on
--
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
under
our
decision
and
i
think
under
--
under
medical
evidence
that
--
that
--
which
is
presented
here
that
--
and
there
--
there's
no
cure
for
narcotic.
we've
cost
inform
of
the
--
many
times,
people
gone
to
the
--
to
the
federal
institution
that
have
gotten
right
back
or
they
have
to
expensive
cures.
and
maybe
5%
or
1%
are
even
thought
to
be
cured
or
after
expensive
medical
--
medical
care.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
well,
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice,
in
--
my
point
is
i'm
not
pleading
it
but
showing
how
the
law
inherently
lends
itself
to
a
double
--
my
point
here
is
that
the
law
inherently
lends
itself
to
double
punishment
before
he
can
--
than
any
continued
status.
mr.
samuel
carter
mcmorris
as
i
understand
the
law
that
if
it's
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
law
that
--
that
i
--
that
i
--
i
could
show
beyond
constitutional
face
of
the
law.
now,
in
this
case,
there's
no
double
application.
i'll
concede
immediately
up
to
this
particular
--
to
this
particular
appellate.
there's
no
double
application
but
on
--
the
law
inherently
amends
itself
to
--
to
any
addict
being
treated
--
being
punished
all
his
life
for
the
condition
which
we
admit
by
medical
evidence,
is
a
--
it's
perhaps
a
lifetime
condition
once
acquired.
i
think
the
solution
is
to
treat
this
illness
and
--
and
to
--
and
to
try
to
take
(inaudible)
and
educate
people
against
it
and
prevent
it
ever
happened.
once
it
happened
on
the
present
medical
knowledge,
we
have
a
lifetime
criminal.
it's
what
we
have
in
the
same
condition
and
this
is
inherent.
i
think
--
