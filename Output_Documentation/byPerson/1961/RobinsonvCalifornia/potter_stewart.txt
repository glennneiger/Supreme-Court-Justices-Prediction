justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
driver
or
the
petitioner?
justice
potter
stewart
the
driver,
not
the
petitioner.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mcmorris
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
alleged
admission
of
having
taken
narcotics
in
the
previous
wednesday,
how
many
days
before
the
arrest
was
the
previous
wednesday
about?
i
mean
what
--
when
was
the
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
friday?
justice
potter
stewart
some
48
hours
before
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
asking
that
question
because
it's
--
i
don't
know
if
it's
entirely
clear
in
the
record
whether
he
was
found
guilty
under
that
--
that
part
of
the
statute
that
proscribes
the
use
of
narcotics
or
that
part
which
requires
--
which
proscribes
being
under
the
influence
of
narcotics
or
this
third
part
being
addicted
to
narcotics.
is
--
is
it
clear
as
to
which
one
of
those
three?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
convicted
of?
justice
potter
stewart
both,
addiction
and
use.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
evidence
before
the
jury
that
he
had
admitted
the
use
some
48
hours
before
the
arrest
that
he
admitted
that
he
had
used
them
some
48
hours
before
the
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
before
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
so
presumably
the
jury
could've
convicted
him
either
of
having
been
a
user,
having
--
having
in
fact
used
them
or
--
or
being
addicted
to
them,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there's
no
way
to
tell
if
the
jury's
verdict
could
have
done?
justice
potter
stewart
because
as
i
suppose,
i
looked
at
one
way
if
there
was
evidence
of
an
actual
use
of
narcotics,
that's
a
little
different
difference
from
conviction
on
the
basis
of
status,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
you
could
--
if
he
had
just
did,
there
were
just
evidence
that
he
was
a
user,
was
no
evidence
of
actual
--
of
an
actual
of
act
of
using
then
you'd
have
a
--
have
a
status
conviction.
but
if
there
was
evidence
of
--
of
an
act
of
using,
then
it
would
be
something
or
somewhat
different
from
a
conviction
based
upon
the
status
alone.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
completely
withdraw,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
go
on,
your
own
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
your
own
supreme
court
of
your
status,
following
up
mr.
justice
douglas'
question
that
is
held
that
the
--
the
state
does
not
have
the
power
to
make
it
criminal
offense
to
be
common
graphic,
isn't
that
correct
in
the
newbern
case?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
based
on
vagueness?
justice
potter
stewart
had
to
be
an
uncommon
graphic,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
point
this
that
under
your
statute
as
construed
by
your
courts,
you
can
get
a
conviction
if
you
get
an
expert
to
let
him
see
the
defendant's
arm
and
say,
"as
an
expert,
i
can
tell
the
jury
that
he
is
an
addict,
whereas
under
the
use
part
of
statute
again
as
construed
by
your
court,
you
have
to
show
an
act
of
use
in
a
particular
place
otherwise
you
have
a
problem
of
venue.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
is
that
statute
cited
in
the
briefs
here
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
of
the
penal
code?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
--
unless
you
have
already
filed
--
what's
you're
looking
for
is
on
page
105
of
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
