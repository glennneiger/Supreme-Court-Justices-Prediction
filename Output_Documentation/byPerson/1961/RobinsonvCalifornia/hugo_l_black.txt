justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
motion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i'm
sure
that
is
in
this
brief.
see
when
you
raised
the
federal
question
in
your
argument
to
the
court.
that's
one
of
the
best
motions.
i
don't
find
the
motion
here
and
stuff.
that's
how
we
looked
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
instruction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
the
charge
on
105
not
covered
at
this
point,
but
you
did
not
ask
for
a
different
charge
that
was
refused?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
this
charge
on
105
doesn't
cover
the
point
that
you
suggested
here
unless
you
can
show
us
that
you
asked
for
a
different
kind
of
charge
explaining?
it
is
plainly
isn't
it
that
they
must
find
it
under
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
all
unanimous.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
could
they
prosecute
him
(inaudible)
for
the
same
thing
if
you
pleaded
formal
jeopardy?
is
that
your
contention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
true
with
reference
to
any
law,
isn't
it,
if
a
man
doesn't
plea
formal
jeopardy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
he
had
to
rob
it
again,
they
could
start
to
prosecute
him
the
second
time.
he
didn't
plead
it.
he
wouldn't
have
in
his
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
said
that
it
last
a
lifetime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it's
implicit
that
a
man
can
never
recover
from
this
thing?
