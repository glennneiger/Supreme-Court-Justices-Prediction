chief

mr.
mcmorris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
--
what
was
that?
i
didn't
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
say
there
was
evidence
as
to
how
he
became
an
addict?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
as
to
--
as
to
how
he
became
an
addict,
i'd
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
something
about
--
in
the
service,
he
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
had
nothing
to
do
with
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
doran.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doran.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
this
--
could
this
statute
be
a
fact
on
vagueness
in
light
manner
because
there's
no
distinction
made
between
whether
this
was
voluntarily
done
or
involuntarily
done?
i
mean,
the
status
was
acquired
voluntarily
or
involuntarily.
i
think
it's
known
that
there
--
that
there
are
people
who
have
acquired
to
have
it
in
hospitals
due
to
treatment
and
--
and
for
some
disease
and
when
they
get
out,
they're
addicts
just
as
much
as
if
that
they've
been
hoodlums
who
had
--
who
had
gone
into
it.
this
statute
makes
no
distinction
between
that
--
between
those
situations
does.
if
he's
an
addict
he's
--he's
subject
to
go
to
jail,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
sometimes,
i
--
i'm
taking
the
position
where
a
doctor
has
treated
him
for
a
disease
or
--
or
some
great
pain
of
some
kind
and
as
administered
narcotics
and
then
when
--
when
that
condition
is
cured,
he
--
he
turns
him
loose
and
--
and
he
is
an
addict
and
--
and
he
can't
get
anymore
--
anymore
narcotics
from
a
doctor
but
he's
an
addict
just
the
same.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
only
help
he'd
need
would
be
to
keep
him
in
narcotics
then
maybe
he's
other
condition
has
been
--
has
been
cured
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doran,
if
he's
prosecuted
as
the
--
as
a
user
under
this
statute,
would
it
be
sufficient
to
show
that
he
had
taken
this
narcotic
once?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
well
now,
would
it
be
possible
if
--
to
prove
he
was
addict
by
just
proving
that
he
had
taken
it
once?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
a
--
you
have
a
certain
standard
for
addiction,
do
you
not
in
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
the
reason
i
asked
is
i
thought
--
i
thought
you
had
a
--
a
section
of
the
welfare
code
5350
which
says
"a
narcotic
drug
addict,
within
the
meaning
of
this
article,
"is
any
person
who
habitually
takes
or
otherwise
uses
to
the
extent
of
having
lost
the
power
of
self-control.
any
opium,
morphine,
cocaine
or
other
narcotic
drug
is
defined
in
article
1
of
chapter
1
of
division
10
of
the
health
and
safety
code.
that's
your
standard,
isn't
it,
a
proof
of
--
of
an
addict?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
prosecute
him.
he's
prosecuted
here
under
that
under
that
section,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
health
and
safety
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
code
are
we
under
here
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
says
as
defined
in
article
1
of
chapter
1
of
division
10
of
the
health
and
safety
code,
that's
what
the
--
that
section
i
just
read.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it
reads
--
it
reads
this
way,
"a
narcotic
drug
addict
within
the
meaning
of
this
article
is
any
person
who
habitually
takes
or
otherwise
is
uses
to
the
extent
of
having
lost
the
power
of
self-control,
any
opium,
morphine,
cocaine
or
other
narcotic
drug
as
defined
in
article
1
of
chapter
1
of
division
10
of
the
health
and
safety
code.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
the
--
not
the
--
the
type
of
addiction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
definition
in
the
other
code
as
to
what
constitutes
an
addict?
chief
justice
earl
warren
habitual
use.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
was
there
any
evidence
to
the
effect
that
he
had
used
it
to
an
extent
of
having
lost
the
power
of
self-control?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there's
nothing
in
the
instructions
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
you're
position
that
you
don't
have
to
--
have
to
prove
that
that
this
section
does
not
apply,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
the
--
has
the
supreme
court
established
a
definition
for
--
for
a
drug
addict
under
this
code?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
new
statute,
did
they
have
any
definition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
status
--
they
did
not.
just
addiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
a
commitment
procedure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcmorris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcmorris
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
may
we
go
back
to
the
--
to
the
instructions
for
just
a
moment.
did
the
court
instruct
that
if
they
found
him
guilty
either
of
--
of
being
a
user
or
an
addict
that
they
could
convict
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
was
--
there
was
just
one
count,
was
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
a
single
count.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
your
point
was
it
that
the
half
of
the
jurors
might
have
found
that
he
was
a
user
and
the
other
half
might
have
found
that
he
was
an
addict
and
they
put
the
two
votes
together
and
found
him
guilty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doran.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
mcmorris,
how
can
it
be
opened
to
you
to
plea
double
jeopardy
when
--
when
this
man
has
only
been
tried
once?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
only
often
the
people
who
are
being
punished
twice
or
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
punish
him
twice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doran,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
please
about
the
procedure.
i
understand
a
year
so
go,
there
was
on
the
valid
statute
to
--
to
give
the
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
over
the
appellate
division
so
the
superior
court,
what
happened
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
