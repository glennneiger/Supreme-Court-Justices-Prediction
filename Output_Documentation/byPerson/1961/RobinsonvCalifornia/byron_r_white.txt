justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
(inaudible)
you
raise
before
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
an
appeal
for
the
municipal
court
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
wouldn't
--
why
is
it
the
habeas
corpus
in
the
action
on
it
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
--
what
does
--
what
does
using
a
word
addiction
added
to
the
--
to
the
user
turn?
in
this
case,
it
was
user
addiction
with
the
jury
on
that
basis.
is
really
the
addiction
had
anything
to
do
with
user
turn?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be
in
many
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
to
establish
the
right
venue
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
(inaudible)
real
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(voice
overlap)
--
truth-wise
in
the
courtroom,
there
is
no
difference
between
proving
user
or
addiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
this
case,
it
wouldn't
make
any
--
the
--
the
addiction
did
have
anything
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
still
because
of
the
venue
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
the
--
the
addiction
assumes
that
--
that
there's
going
to
be
an
active
use
so
called.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand
that.
but
it
is
a
venue
problem
not
a
--
there's
nothing
else.
