this
was
all
on
the
street?
justice
john
m.

has
this
--
had
there
been
many
prosecutions
under
this
section
of
the
statute?
justice

been
the
addiction
--
the
addiction
clause
has
never
been
before
the
california
supreme

justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
but,
they
never
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
never
written
on
the
subject?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
is
it
could
you
--
you
say
there'd
been
many
prosecutions,
how
is
this
statute
of
--
enforce,
i
would
suppose
--
do
you
have
cases
where
a
man
has
been
convicted
of
addiction,
served
for
90
days
and
let
out
and
picked
up
the
next
day
again
and
convicted
again
because
he
hasn't
abandoned
his
addiction?
it's
a
continuing
condition
addiction
and
a
very
different
one
to
get
rid
of
and
i
was
wondering
as
a
practical
matter,
how
this
statute
is
enforced?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
cases
where
the
same
individual,
same
addict
has
been
prosecuted
over
a
series
of
prosecutions
for
the
same
addiction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
those
figures
out?
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
there's
--
maybe
there's
a
statement
though?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
state
contend
that
the
federal
question
is
not
raised?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
higher
state
courts?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
does
this
statute
--
