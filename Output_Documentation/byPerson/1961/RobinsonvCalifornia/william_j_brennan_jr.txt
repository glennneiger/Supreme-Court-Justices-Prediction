justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you've
represented
some
municipality,
not
the
same
you
can
say
that
you
have
represented
some
who
had
convicted
in
one
municipality
or
county
under
the
statute,
had
then
been
prosecuted
in
another
also
for
addiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
attached
such
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
didn't
you
interpose
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
know
whether
the
--
that
plea
has
not
been
honored
when
made
or
has
it
ever
been
made?
do
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
get
him
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
a
new
use
you
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
exactly.
may
i
ask
mr.
mcmorris,
at
what
stage
of
this
proceeding
did
you
raise
any
constitutional
about
the
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
refer
us
in
the
record
where
you
raised
this
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't
waste
your
time
as
--
take
your
time
looking
for
it
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
mcmorris,
is
that
--
this
is
not
an
unusual
procedure.
your
review
here
is
in
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
not
in
--
in
intermediate
court
of
appeals,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
the
point
this
is
not,
as
i
recall,
previous
cases
from
your
state,
when
you
go
to
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court,
you
get
in
effective
trial
de
novo.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
an
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
trial
the
novel
on
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
mcmorris,
may
i
ask
at
page
112.
this
is
what
i
was
looking
for.
i
note
here
that
your
appellate
part
says,
no
appeal
lies
in
the
appellate
department
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
or
the
supreme
court
yet
habeas
corpus
lies
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
the
section
in
question.
we
would
welcome
such
a
test.
now,
did
you
proceed
by
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
did
we
get
to
this
case
here
directly
from
the
appellate
department
rather
than
from
whatever
action
was
taken
under
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
telling
us
then
that
in
fact
the
persecution
withdrawn
the
--
or
using
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
it
come
down
to
that
--
if
--
if
i
understood
you,
if
there's
been
one
conviction
under
this,
you'll
not
prosecute
again
unless
there's
evidence
of
a
substance
use?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
that's
--
isn't
that
second
prosecution,
a
prosecution
from
user
--
for
user
rather
than
addiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
but
if
--
as
i
understand
you
though,
if
he
were
apprehended
again
after
serving
his
term,
if
this
conviction
has
sustained,
you
would
not
prosecute
him
unless
you
had
some
evidence
which
proved
both
venue
and
another
user.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
--
i
simply
don't
understand
what
--
what
you
get
out
of
prosecuting
him
for
addiction
on
the
second
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you're
saying
and
i
gather
is
that
you're
expert
under
the
prosecution
for
addiction.
you
may
testify
that
this
fellow
was
a
user
on
some
day
subsequent
for
the
last
time
he
was
convicted
of
being
--
of
addiction.
without
having
to
show
that
whatever
--
whenever
that
last
time
occur,
exactly
where
it
was
the
use,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this.
he's
convicted,
he
serves
90
days
in
jail,
he's
picked
up
again
on
some
other
county.
and
an
expert
now
comes
in
and
says
"well,
since
he's
completed
that
90
days
in
jail,
i
can
tell
looking
at
his
arms
that
he's
used
the
stuff
again.
and
then
he
prosecuted
for
addiction
on
non
--
non-evidence
as
i
understand
that
he
can
be
convicted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
has
to
be
proof
that
since
he
served
his
last
term,
he's
again
used
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
you
don't
have
to
prove
where
he
used.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
11
of
what
code?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
chapter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happens
to
someone
convicted
under
this?do
they
get
any
treatment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ust
--
just
to
a
common
jail
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
may
when
he
gets
to
that
jail,
he
sent
to
a
hospital?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
--
what
--
you
say
this
is
a
new
statute
which
provides
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
telling
us
that
you
could
make
some
kind
of
application
to
have
this
fellow
transferred
from
the
prison
to
a
hospital
for
treatment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
making
--
are
you
--
are
you
suggesting
that
perhaps
under
the
welfare
code,
an
addict
might
be
convicted
under
the
penal
code
as
an
addict
for
the
purpose
of
that
code
might
not
qualified
to
a
treatment
under
the
definition
of
addict
under
the
welfare
code,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
he
may
or
may
not
qualified
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
there's
a
chance
that
he
could
not.
he
could
be
convicted
then
yet
not
qualified
for
treatment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
they
in
fact
prosecute
a
second
time
prediction
except
as
they
can
have
evidence
of
the
subsequent
user?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
thought
--
i
thought
what
you
told
was
that
this
would
not
be
done
that
actually
if
they're
going
to
prosecute
him
the
second
time,
there
must
be
a
new
hole
in
the
track.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
have
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
have
that
case
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happens
to
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
far
did
it
go
i
mean?
did
it
just
go
to
the
--
to
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
