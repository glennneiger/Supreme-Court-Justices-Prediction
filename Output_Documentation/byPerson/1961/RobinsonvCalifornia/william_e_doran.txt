mr.

e.
doran
(inaudible)
your
honor,
the
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
harlan
are
in
the
record
2014
to
2038.
in
appendix
a,
a
petitioner's
opening
brief,
the
entire
appendix
a
of
petitioner's
opening
brief.
mr.
william
e.
doran
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
mcmorris
stated
the
appellant
herein
was
convicted
of
11721,
subsection
of
health
and
safety
code
of
california.
and
also
has
he
stated,
the
cause
went
to
the
jury
only
on
two
issues,
use
and
addiction
under
the
influence
of
that
aspect
of
the
--
of
the
section.
the
court
took
from
the
jury
my
instructions.
i
may
say
first
getting
directly
to
mr.
mcmorris
his
main
contention
of
purported
unconstitutional
status.
this
addiction
statute
first
became
criminal
in
california
in
1929
when
it
was
added
to
the
penal
code
as
part
of
the
vagrancy
section.
in
1939,
it
was
deleted
from
the
penal
code
and
the
vagrancy
section
and
put
into
the
new
health
and
safety
code
which
is
connected
i
think
at
that
time.
since
then,
it
has
remained
in
the
health
and
safety
code
and
has
been
amended
from
time-to-time
in
minor
details.
in
the
briefs,
both
appellant
and
appellee
have
referred
consistently
to
vagrancy
probably
because
it's
the
closest
or
the
--
the
most
usual,
shall
we
say,
statute
under
which
a
status
is
involved.
now,
its
appellee's
contention
that
when
this
section
was
removed
from
the
vagrancy
section
in
california
and
put
into
the
health
and
safety
code,
the
only
remaining
aspect
of
vagrancy
or
even
comparison
to
vagrancy
that
remained
was
the
aspects
of
its
status.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
thereafter,
the
ordinary
ideas
of
vagrancy
such
as
a
--
a
tramp
or
a
ne'er-do-well
or
a
wonderer
and
such
of
the
many
common
known
types,
we
are
not
involved
with
the
situation
like
that
at
all.
we
are
involved
with
a
man
who
is
putting
a
foreign
fire
into
his
veins,
and
it
bears
no
relationship
that
we
contented.
there
is
no
further
relationship
to
vagrancy
except
--
except
the
peculiarity
status.
now,
counsel
has
cited
many
of
these
vagrancy
cases
and
of
course
we
have
cited
them,
too.
and
he
has
referred
to
two
particularly
lanzetta
against
new
jersey
and
edelman
against
california.
the
lanzetta
case
involved
vagrancy
decided
by
this
court
and
it
struck
down
the
--
the
statute
but
not
on
the
ground
alone
that
it
punished
the
status.
they
struck
him
down
because
it
was
vague
and
indefinite
in
trying
to
define
the
status,
it
was
going
to
punish.
the
same
in
edelman
which
this
court
having
taken
jurisdiction
didn't
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
but
they
were
two
dissenting
opinions
that
went
to
the
merits.
and
the
same
thing
shall
i
say
happen
there.
the
california
vagrancy
statute
was
attacked
but
--
on
a
very
peculiar
circumstances
by
which
california
or
the
city
of
los
angeles
in
this
instance
utilized
a
section
6475
of
the
penal
code
which
proscribe,
lewd
and
dissolute
conduct
making
such
person
a
vagrant,
that's
the
statement
of
the
statute.
however,
in
that
case,
the
edelman
case,
they
didn't
plead
lewdness.
the
pleading
went
only
to
dissolutes.
and
it
was
an
unfortunate
situation
no
doubt
because
what
they
were
trying
to
reach
was
something
that
the
word
"dissolute"
as
the
two
dissenting
justices
here
held
just
shouldn't
reach.
and
peculiarly
enough
and
about
the
same
time,
the
appellate
department
of
superior
court
of
los
angeles
from
which
the
appellant
of
--
from
which
the
edelman
case
came,
decided
another
case
unreported
case
of
people
against
dragna
where
they
assumed
practically
the
same
position
as
assumed
by
the
dissent
in
this
court
to
the
effect
that
lewd
and
dissolute
were
used
in
the
statutes
anonymously.
and
meant
--
they
meant
the
same
thing
and
as
you
couldn't
state
an
offense
merely
by
the
word
"dissolute".
statue
was
aimed
at
lewdness.
mr.
william
e.
doran
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
the
statute
contains
a
specific
exemption
for
narcotics
administered
by
some
with
license
to
so
administer
and
that
would
be
the
position
of
one
who
--
who
became
an
unfortunate
addict
due
to
medic
--
medical
reasons.
mr.
william
e.
doran
well,
your
honor,
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive.
it
would
appear
to
me
for
a
doctor
to
--
to
release
a
man
and
push
him
up
without
medical
help
if
he
needed
that
medical
help
as
to
his
addiction.
that's
the
only
way
i
can
differentiate.
mr.
william
e.
doran
well,
i
--
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
he
would
be
--
he
would
fall
under
the
exception
on
--
of
the
statute
that
the
narcotics
would
be
administered
by
a
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
--
competent
doctor.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
well,
i
think
there
your
honor
we're
getting
to
what
would
be
a
reasonable
exercise
of
police
power
and
they
would
appear
to
be
a
vast
difference
between
narcotics
such
as
heroin
being
injected
in
the
veins
and
smoke
being
taken
into
the
lungs.
certainly,
there
is
a
comparison.
but
i
think
we're
getting
to
police
power
there
rather
than
what
we're
involved
with
here.
well,
on
that
your
honor,
a
question
was
asked
by
mr.
mcmorris.
mr.
william
e.
doran
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
doran
in
the
newbern
case
your
honor
that
was
not
based
as
i
recall
upon
police
power.
it
was
based
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
right,
your
honor.
the
word
"common"
was
declared
to
be
too
vague
and
indefinite
to
permit
the
--
the
defendant
to
recognize
whether
it
was
going
to
affect
the
law
or
not.
strictly
on
that
and
it
did
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
well,
we
have
those
two,
your
honor.
but
it
didn't
go
to
--
to
the
aspect
of
status
at
all.
the
newbern
case,
it
went
merely
to
the
vagueness
and
indefinite
of
the
word
"common.
but
getting
back
to
the
other
question
that
was
asked
of
mr.
mcmorris,
as
to
the
possibility
of
a
person's
serving
90
days
under
this
--
under
a
conviction
under
the
statute,
then
coming
out
and
being
picked
up
again
immediately
for
addiction.
i
might
say
that
such
would
be
impossible
under
the
methods
of
prosecution
at
least
that
i'm
familiar
with
in
california.
for
this
reason,
all
of
these
addiction
prosecutions
are
based
upon
circumstantial
evidence
or
mainly
they
are
based
upon
circumstantial
evidence
of
the
scabs
and
marks
that
appear
from
the
body
of
the
defendant,
usually
on
his
arms
over
the
veins.
the
expert
testifies
that
he
sees
so
many
marks
and
he
--
he
explains
how
old
these
scabs
are
and
how
old
the
marks
are
and
establish
is
that
as
a
present
condition,
the
person
is
addicted
and
a
current
user.
now,
if
a
person
is
in
jail
for
90
days,
i
am
sure
the
reading
of
the
expert
testimony
of
the
gentlemen
who
testified
in
this
page
at
page
54
of
the
record,
mr.
lindquist,
but
i'm
not
going
to
read
with
but
it
will
reveal
that
by
the
time
a
person
has
served
90
days
in
jail,
all
current
marks
will
be
removed
from
his
body
and
he
just
couldn't
be
convicted
again
without
acquiring
new
marks
or
by
the
testimony
that
it
wasn't
true
one
or
the
other.
just
we
just
--
the
prosecution
just
could
not
establish
the
circumstances
indicating
his
addiction.
mr.
william
e.
doran
no,
your
honor.
there
are
two
aspects
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
that
would
be
necessary,
yes,
your
honor.
that
it
couldn't
be
any
other
way.
mr.
william
e.
doran
it
could
be
either
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
in
this
case
your
honor,
i
would
say
no,
it
didn't
because
we
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
yes,
your
honor.
in
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
--
in
many
cases,
it's
indispensable
for
this
reason
under
a
case
of
people
against
garcia
which
is
cited
in
--
in
i
think
mr.
mcmorris'
brief.
it
was
held
that
to
convict
for
use,
you
must
establish
venue
which
in
california
would
be
in
the
particular
county
in
--
in
the
municipal
court.
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
there
are
no
--
you
--
you
wouldn't
charge
a
person
with
use
if
you
saw
him
using
it.
because
if
you
saw
him
using
it,
you
would
have
found
him
in
possession
of
the
narcotic
a
felony
and
a
lesser
charge
would
of
course
be
ignored.
therefore,
the
only
way
we
can
prove
user
is
by
the
admission
of
the
defendant
himself
as
took
place
in
this
case.
beyond
that
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
that
is
the
big
problem.
mr.
william
e.
doran
no,
not
--
not
--
if
we
have
the
proof
of
both
as
we
maintain
--
we
have
in
this
case.
but
--
unless
you
can
get
an
admission
from
the
defendant
that
he
used
in
the
particular
county
or
prosecution,
you
can't
make
a
case
on
user.
mr.
william
e.
doran
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
absolutely,
your
honor.
you
would
have
to
prove
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
correct,
your
honor,
exactly.
and
for
that
reason,
the
addiction
part
of
the
statute
is
the
most
important
part
of
it
in
at
least
85%
or
90%of
the
cases
except
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
exactly.
mr.
william
e.
doran
the
addiction
takes
place
in
the
county
or
in
the
jurisdiction
where
the
person
is
apprehended.
he
is
apprehended
as
they're
being
addicted.
mr.
william
e.
doran
so
the
problem
of
venue
is
their
met.
mr.
william
e.
doran
in
use.
it's
a
distinct
venue
problem
in
use.
it's
no
venue
problem
at
all
as
to
addiction.
mr.
william
e.
doran
substantially,
your
honor,
yes.
in
other
words,
the
expert
testifies
to
what
he
sees
upon
the
defendant's
arm.
mr.
william
e.
doran
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
as
a
user,
yes,
i
would
say.
mr.
william
e.
doran
no,
your
honor.
i
would
say
no.
mr.
william
e.
doran
well,
for
getting
to
a
point
that
approaches
the
newbern
decision
that
has
been
discussed
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
only
for
purposes
of
--
of
the
welfare
and
institutions
code,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
no,
your
honor,
under
the
health
and
safety
code.
mr.
william
e.
doran
that's
right.
and
may
direct
--
invite
your
honor's
attention
to
the
case
of
people
against
kimbley.
mr.
william
e.
doran
health
and
safety,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
maybe
i'm
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
the
section
that
your
honor
has
referred
to
of
the
--
of
the
welfare
and
institutions
code,
i
believe
is
the
one
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
i
think
your
honor
that
the
reference
to
article
1
chapter
1
division
10
of
the
health
--
health
and
safety
code
refers
to
the
types
of
narcotics
that
are
there
in
named,
not
the
type
of
addiction.
mr.
william
e.
doran
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
no,
your
honor.
not
to
my
knowledge.
and
it
--
and
was
instructed
in
this
case,
it
was
--
the
jury
was
instructed
merely
that
it's
a
habitual
use
so
to
speak.
mr.
william
e.
doran
yes.
mr.
william
e.
doran
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
doran
correct,
your
honor.
and
as
i
stated,
the
case
of
people
against
--
in
the
case
of
people
against
kimbley
cited
at
page
18
of
our
brief,
we
answer
that
contention
made
by
appellant
that
that
definition
should
apply
and
the
kimbley
case
indicates
that
it
is
--
that
definition
is
for
only
the
purpose
of
the
welfare
and
institutions
code
and
does
not
apply
for
instance
to
this
case
which
was
a
vehicle
code
violation.
they
said
that
they
will
not
utilize
that
except
for
the
purposes
of
the
welfare
and
institution
code.
it
is
not
applicable
to
others.
mr.
william
e.
doran
not
other
than,
to
my
knowledge,
was
utilized
in
the
instructions
in
this
case,
just
a
common,
ordinary
definition
of
addiction,
habitual
use.
getting
to
the
--
to
the
actual,
factual
aspects
of
the
case,
and
may
i
say
so
on
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
--
to
the
prosecution,
this
automobile
was
apprehended
by
the
police
department
while
driving
down
the
dark
street
at
night
with
no
illumination
on
the
license
plate.
the
driver
of
the
automobile
voluntarily
got
out
of
the
car
and
met
the
policeman.
whereas
the
policeman
there
looked
for
the
flashlight,
saw
the
mark
on
his
arm
and
didn't
arrest
him
then
as
has
been
contended.
he
questioned
him
about
his
use
of
narcotics
if
any
and
the
driver
mr.
banks
stated
that
yes,
he
was
a
narcotic
user.
thereupon,
he
was
arrested.
thereafter,
the
other
passengers
of
the
automobile
were
removed
from
the
automobile
by
his
fellow
officer
and
the
automobile
was
searched.
the
appellant
here
mr.
robertson
has
--
robinson
as
one
of
the
passengers
was
on
the
sidewalk
and
the
officer
noticing
a
purported
nervousness
and
perspiration,
asked
him
if
he
used
narcotics
and
he
has
thereupon
stated,
yes,
he
did.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
completed
mission
to
the
arresting
officers
as
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
prior
to
any
arrest.
thereafter
the
admission,
the
officer
did
order
mr.
robinson
to
bare
his
arms
so
that
he
could
look
at
them.
the
officer
did
look
at
them,
noticed
marks
and
thereupon
arrested
mr.
robinson.
and
it's
our
position
that
in
this
course
of
events,
as
they
transpired,
never
did
there
occur
any
illegal
search
or
seizure
in
any
ways
he
performed.
it
was
all
--
all
of
it
developed
from
the
officer
seeing
what
was
in
plain
site
to
be
seen
and
listening
to
the
admissions
of
the
defendant
as
the
transaction
went
along.
as
to
appellant's
contention
of
addiction
being
an
illness,
of
course,
we
agree
but
i
might
say
this
as
to
his
contention
that
you
cannot
constitutionally
punish
a
status.
california
since
this
case
has
--
has
been
tried,
has
it
not
enacted
a
comprehensive
new
program
of
treatment
for
narcotic
addicts
added
to
section
11
to
the
penal
code.
the
entire
program
depends
upon
the
term
"addiction"
as
do
many
federal
statutes
regarding
the
entry
of
immigrants
into
this
country
toward
drug
addicts
it's
prohibited.
the
word
"addiction"
is
used,
the
word
statutes
--
"status"
is
--
the
term
"status"
is
indispensable.
the
same
in
the
deportation
of
drug
addicts
from
the
united
states.
this
status,
addiction
is
indispensable,
we
contend,
in
the
control
of
the
use
of
narcotics
by
the
user.
if
we
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
william
e.
doran
that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor,
yes.
addiction
having
--
one
step
further,
a
finding
by
the
court
of
--
that
someone
is
in
imminent
danger
of
becoming
addicted
which
carries
at
even
one
step
further.
and
it
is
a
process
by
which
in
a
lower
court
--
a
trial
court,
if
it
appears
to
the
trial
court
that
the
defendant
is
addicted
or
in
imminent
danger
of
it,
the
cause
is
thereafter
transferred
to
the
superior
court
for
hearings,
it
goes
--
a
determination
is
made
and
the
man
is
sent
to
a
hospital
which
is
no
one
to
be
course
of
development
for
narcotic
addicts.
mr.
william
e.
doran
under
a
commitment
procedure
similar
to
an
insanity
proceeding,
your
honor.
so
it
--
it
is
our
most
furnish
contention
that
you
control
addiction
of
narcotics,
trafficking
narcotics.
the
utilization
of
the
status
addict
is
absolutely
indispensable.
thank
you.
mr.
william
e.
doran
i'd
like
to
start
with
most
the
presence
of
mind
with
mr.
doran's
last
point
which
is
a
hard
point
which
i
made,
section
11
of
the
penal
code
deals
in
the
treatment
of
these
acts.
i
am
100%
in
favor
of
it.
they
need
to
be
in
hospitals.
i
never
contend
that
we
can't
treat
them
as
a
class.
in
a
proper
approach,
i
said
we
can't
treat
them
as
criminals
and
let
them
kick
this
thing
cold
turkey
and
die
and
suffer
from
it.
i'm
100%
in
favor
of
section
11
of
the
penal
code
and
the
word
there,
the
emphasis
of
upon
treatment.
mr.
william
e.
doran
and
also
on
page
--
page
102,
they
combined
the
two,
did
they
not?
you
will
take
note
that
it
is
a
misdemeanor
for
a
person
either
to
use
narcotics
or
to
be
addicted
to
the
use
of
narcotics
unless
the
used
or
being
addicted
to
narcotics
was
administered
to
use
under
the
direction
of
a
license
person.
mr.
william
e.
doran
that's
your
honor
--
of
course,
it
wasn't
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
case.
but
i
sub
--
first
of
this
year,
it
went
into
effect
and
now
by
petition
in
the
appellate
department,
it
is
possible
to
go
from
there
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
if
they
per
--
if
they
allow
it
in
the
reference.
if
they
do
not
permit
the
reference,
there
is
a
provision
that
goes
to
district
court
of
appeal
and
asks
for
such
reference.
if
granted,
it
can
then
go
in
the
regular
change
of
the
time.
mr.
william
e.
doran
in
this
case?
mr.
william
e.
doran
they
were
both
denied
your
honor
on
application.
mr.
william
e.
doran
one
was
filed
as
i
understand
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
of
california
--
mr.
william
e.
doran
--
and
another
in
the
supreme
court
of
california.
may
i
say
this
mr.
justice
brennan?
in
regard
to
those
--
to
that
aspect
of
going
to
the
higher
courts,
those
petitions
are
filed
merely
as
--
as
we
know
on
a
petition
of
--
of
the
defendant.
the
true
record
is
not
before
that
court
when
they
determine
if
on
application
to
deny
that.
mr.
william
e.
doran
it
makes
difficult
sometimes
with
the
petitioner.
