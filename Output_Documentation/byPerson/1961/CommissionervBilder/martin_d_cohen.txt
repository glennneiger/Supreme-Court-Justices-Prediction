mr.
martin
d.
cohen
may
it
please
the
court.
my
time
will
be
devoted
to
two
efforts.
first,
the
government
has
made
certain
arguments,
the
better
ones
of
which
deserve
to
be
answered
and
they
shall
be
answered.
and,
secondly,
we,
in
our
brief,
raise
certain
issues
which
directly
invited
response
from
the
government.
i
shall
state
what
these
points
were
and
leave
it
to
this
court
to
determine
whether
the
government
has
responded
with
respect
to
each
such
point
in
a
manner
which
satisfies
the
minds
of
fair
and
logical
men.
firstly,
the
government
relies
upon
the
asserted
significance
of
section
262
of
the
1954
code.
if
i
may
restate
the
theory
of
the
government,
it
is
that
section
262
says
that
no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
personal
family
or
living
expenses
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
the
income
tax
provisions
of
the
code.
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
expressly,
as
you
say
your
honor.
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
the
government
then
goes
on
from
there
to
say
where
in
the
code
is
there
any
expressed
provision
for
lodging
in
a
case
such
as
this.
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
it
says
in
the
chapter,
but
i
think
it
refers
to
the
income
tax
provisions
of
the
code.
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
--
code.
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
our
answer
to
this
contention
is
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
service
himself,
has
undermined
that
argument
by
providing
in
rulings
and
regulations
which
he
has
promulgated
that
at
least
four
situations
he
will
in
fact
allow
lodging
expense
and,
indeed,
food,
despite
the
absence
of
an
expressed
provision
in
the
chapter,
referred
to
in
262.
the
first
situation,
of
course,
is
that
of
a
hospital
bill
which
includes
board
and
lodging.
by
regulation,
the
commissioner
says,
this,
he
will
allow,
although
nowhere
in
the
code
is
there
any
expressed
provision
for
board
and
lodging
as
part
of
a
hospital
bill.
however,
the
commissioner
goes
a
step
further.
he
says
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
board
and
lodging
expense
be
incurred
in
a
hospital.
it
is
sufficient
if
incurred
in
an
institution
similar
in
nature
to
a
hospital
where
the
primary
purpose
for
the
taxpayer's
presence
there
is
the
receipt
of
care
which
will
alleviate
a
physical
or
mental
condition.
then,
the
commissioner
goes,
what
i
believe
is,
still
a
step
further.
he
says,
if
an
individual
is
in
a
school,
a
special
school,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
overcome
a
physical
or
mental
handicap
on
the
part
of
that
individual,
the
commissioner
will
then
allow
food,
lodging,
and
the
cost
of
tuition
for
the
presence
in
that
special
school
and
there
is
no
limitation
as
to
time.
presumably,
an
individual
that
have
such
a
defect
can
remain
in
the
school
for
many
years
and,
each
year,
the
food
and
the
lodging
and
the
tuition
will
be
deductible
by
the
commissioner's
interpretation
and,
again,
in
the
complete
absence
of
any
expressed
authority
for
such
an
allowance
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
and,
finally,
there
is
another
example
of
what
i
regard
to
be
the
commissioner's
inconsistency
and
that
is
in
an
unrelated
but
very
analogous
situation.
i
have
reference
to
the
case
of
the
man
who
is
devoting
his
time
to
a
particular
charity
which
would
be
the
type
of
charity
that
would
be
regarded
as
a
tax-exempt
organization.
the
commissioner
has
ruled,
and
we
cite
it
in
our
brief,
that
where
such
an
individual
goes
to
a
convention
or
a
similar
type
of
function
on
behalf
of
the
charity,
that
he
may
deduct
a
reasonable
amount
for
food
and
lodging
while
he
is
on
such
a
trip.
and,
again,
there
is
no
expressed
authority
anywhere
in
the
code
for
such
an
interpretation.
now,
the
second
point
which
the
government
makes,
which
i
believe
deserves
answer,
is
the
point
why
would
congress
have
added
subparagraph
(b)
to
the
previous
definition
of
medical
care,
unless
congress
had
in
mind
the
expressed
exclusion
of
food
and
lodging
expenses?
we
say,
first,
that
if
that
had
been
the
intent
of
congress,
congress
could
certainly
had
easily
so
stated
in
the
code
itself.
it
did
not
do
so.
secondly,
we
feel
that
there
is
a
much
less
strained
explanation
for
the
addition
of
subparagraph
(b),
and
that
is
contained
in
revenue
ruling
55-251
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
now,
although
that
revenue
ruling
attempts
to
codify
the
various
types
of
medical
deductions
which
will
be
allowed
under
the
1939
code,
it
was,
curiously
enough,
issued
in
1955
after
the
1954
code
had
been
enacted.
now,
example
3
in
that
revenue
ruling
says
this.
as
the
heading
trans
--
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
it
would
be,
if
the
court
please,
in
the
cumulative
bulletin.
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
i
just
took
some
inserts
for
convenience,
but
the
revenue
ruling
is
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
revenue
ruling
55-251
and
it's
divided
i
think
into
13
subparagraphs,
taking
the
different
types
of
medical
expense
which
will
or
will
not
be
allowed
according
to
the
revenue
ruling.
now,
example
3
has
a
heading
“transportation
expense
of
a
physically
disabled
person
to
and
from
his
place
of
employment.”
in
this
case,
taxicab
fares
were
paid
by
a
physically
handicapped
victim
of
polio
in
commuting
to
and
from
his
place
of
employment.
the
expense
of
such
transportation
is
a
personal
expense
not
deductible
for
federal
income
tax
purposes.
the
rationale,
i
assume,
being
that
the
transportation
was
not
to
receive
medical
care
but
simply
to
get
to
work.
on
the
other
hand,
in
example
8
of
the
same
ruling,
again
under
the
heading
“transportation
expense,”
it
says
transportation
expense
to
a
doctor's
office
says
--
section
39.23
(x)-1
(d)
(1)
of
regulations
118
provides
the
travel
primarily
for
and
essential
to
the
rendition
of
medical
services
is
an
allowable
medical
deduction.
transportation
expenses
as,
for
example,
taxicab
fares
paid
for
and
properly
substantiated
as
being
primarily
for
the
rendition
of
medical
services
constitutes
an
allowable
medical
deduction.
so,
you
see,
the
commissioner
--
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
this
is
under
the
1939
code,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
and
that
had
not
been
expressly
covered.
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
so,
i
say
that
the
commissioner,
himself,
has
furnished
the
answer
to
his
own
question,
what
would
be
the
purpose
for
the
addition
of
this
subparagraph
(b),
and
i
say
it
is
to
clarify
the
difference
between
transportation
of
a
physically
handicapped
person
who
is
not,
however,
using
the
transportation
to
receive
medical
care
and
the
transportation
expense
of
one
who
is
using
the
transportation
in
order
to
obtain
medical
care
and
i
feel
that
is
a
far
less
strained
interpreta
--
explanation
of
the
addition
of
subparagraph
(b)
than
the
one
from
which
the
government
contends.
now,
the
third
point
which
the
government
makes,
and
the
one
i
think
that
is
the
real
problem
in
this
case,
is
the
committee
report,
an
excerpt
of
which
was
read
by
mr.
pollak.
my
response
to
this
is
that,
assuming
that
congress
intended
that
what
it
stated
in
that
committee
report
be
the
law
and
if
we
can
sanction
legislation
by
committee
report
rather
than
by
statute,
nevertheless,
the
facts
in
that
example
are
not
our
facts.
if
you'll
recall
that
the
simple
statement
was
it
was
a
patient,
suffering
from
a
chronic
ailment,
who
goes
to
a
warmer
climate
to
alleviate
the
condition.
we
have
here,
as
my
adversary
so
fairly
stated,
a
man
who
after
four
heart
attacks
at
the
age
of
42,
was
told
by
his
doctor
“you
have
either
got
to
leave
the
blustery
winds
and
cold
temperatures
of
new
jersey
during
the
winter
months
and
also
take
this
anticoagulant
drug
that
it
have
prescribed
for
you
or,
surely,
you
are
going
to
die.”
now,
there
are
two
ways
that
you
can
avoid
the
in
temp--
the
inclement
climate
of
jersey.
one
would
be
to
be
hospitalized.
the
other
would
be
to
go
to
a
climate
where
you
will
not
be
subjected
to
these
intemperate
winds
and
cold
temperatures.
“now,
in
your
case,”
the
doctor
told
mr.
bilder,
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
“i
advise
against
hospitalization.
you
are
a
hypertense,
over
energetic
person
and
if
we
close
you
or
shut
you
up
in
a
hospital
for
three
months,
the
walls
are
going
to
start
closing
in
on
you
and
it's
going
to
have
the
effect
of
perhaps
producing
another
myocardial
infarction.
statistics
demonstrate
that
a
person
of
your
temperament,
if
closed
in,
and
who
has
a
past
history
of
heart
attacks
and
myocardial
infarctions
is
likely
to
have
further
ones.
and,
in
addition
to
that,
when
you
rec
--
when
you
had
suffered
these
myocardial
infarctions,
your
coronary
arteries
were
permanently
damaged.
now,
true,
nature
supplies
new
vessels
to
take
over
the
function
to
bring
blood
to
and
from
the
heart,
but
nature
needs
an
assist
in
the
form
of
modern
exercise
and,
this,
you
cannot
get
in
the
hospital.
so,
in
your
case,
i
recommend
as
the
best
means
of
preserving
your
life
that
you
go
to
a
place
where
you
can
get
this
modern
exercise
and,
at
the
same
time,
receive
this
anticoagulant
therapy
and,
most
importantly,
have
available
a
doctor
and
a
testing
laboratory
which
is
familiar
with
the
peculiar
properties
of
this
drug,”
because
in
1953
there
were
very
few
such
in
the
country.
fort
lauderdale,
as
the
tax
court
found,
happen
to
be
one
of
them.
so,
we
have
the
anomaly
of
this
taxpayer,
had
he
not
obeyed
his
doctor's
advice,
had
he
nevertheless
said
“well,
put
me
in
a
hospital.
it's
closer
to
home
and
i
want
to
be
in
touch
with
the
office
every
day,”
had
he
disobeyed
his
doctor,
he
could
have
gotten
his
deduction
for
food
and
lodging.
however,
while
obeying
what
his
doctor,
one
of
the
most
eminent
heart
men
in
the
world
told
him
to
do,
he
is
now
confronted
with
the
almost
incredible
situation
of
having
the
government
say
“we
can't
allow
you
to
a
deduction
if
you
obey
your
doctor,
only,
in
your
case
if
you
had
disobeyed
him.”
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
i
wouldn't
want
to
undertake
to
get
into
that
one,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
finally,
i
think
an
argument
made
by
the
government
which
must
be
answered
is
a
suggestion
that
the
broad
interpretation
of
section
23
(x)
of
the
1939
code
had
led
to
widespread
abuse.
now,
in
our
brief,
in
an
appendix,
we
attempted
to
list
all
those
cases
which
our
research
discovery
which
under
the
1939
code
or
under
any
code,
had
dealt
with
the
question
of
the
allowability
of
this
type
of
expense
as
a
medical
deduction.
and,
we
point
out
that
the
government
and
the
courts
were
most
deciduous
in
seeing
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
this
statute
which
was
to
be
broadly
interpreted
because
i
think
only
5
of
the
40
cases
was
of
full
deduction
allowed
and
perhaps
in
some
nine
others
was
a
partial
deduction
allowed.
in
all
other
26
cases,
there
was
a
complete
disallowance
of
the
expense
because
the
taxpayer
had
failed
to
satisfy
the
court
that
the
primary
purpose
for
the
expense
in
question
was
the
receipt
of
medical
care.
so,
we
would
sug
--
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
this
case
be
decided
not
on
possible
abuse,
which
i
don't
think
will
occur,
but
on
the
correct
law
to
be
applied
here,
and
i
trust
that
this
court
will
decide
this
case
directly
and
i
further
trust
that
the
commissioner
will
use
his
discretion
in
determining
the
wheat
--
separating
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
in
subsequent
cases
as
he
has
in
the
past.
now,
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
turn
to
those
points
that
we
have
made
which
i
do
not
feel
the
government
has
responded
to.
first,
i
raise
the
--
we
raise
the
question
how
can
lodging
expense
be
allowed
in
situations
which
the
regulations
permit
and
not
in
a
case
such
as
this
or
not
in
the
case
such
as
that
of
mr.
carasso
who
had
--
who
went
to
the
second
circuit
but
lost.
and,
if
i
may
very
briefly
restate
the
facts
in
the
carasso
case,
this
was
a
man
of
modest
means
who
was
employed
as
a
traveling
salesman.
while
he
was
in
new
england,
in
connection
with
his
duties
as
such
salesman,
he
was
stricken
with
a
serious
illness
which
required
the
major
portion
of
his
stomach
be
removed
by
surgery.
and,
after
two
or
three
weeks
of
being
in
the
hospital,
when
he
had
lost
50
pounds
of
weight,
that
required
some-23
quarts
of
blood
and
informed
transfusions,
he
was
released
from
the
hospital
but
he
was
too
weak
to
travel
back
to
his
home
in
brooklyn,
new
york,
so
he
arranged
to
stay
for
a
time
with
some
friends
nearby
the
hospital.
and
finally,
he
made
the
trip
back
to
brooklyn.
it
was
in
march
of
the
year
and
he
was
getting
no
better.
so,
his
doctor
said
to
him
“if
you
wish
to
have
a
healthy
con
--
a
convalescence
which
will
enable
you
to
regain
your
vigor,
i
suggest
that
you
get
out
of
brooklyn
in
this
month
of
march,
go
to
some
place
that
will
give
you
a
little
opportunity
to
take
your
wife's
arm
and
walk
and
gradually
build
your
strength
back,”
and
this
man
did
that.
he
went
to
bermuda
for
nine
days
in
the
company
of
his
wife
whom
the
tax
court
found
served
the
function
of
a
nurse
while
there
and
that
he
could
not
in
fact
have
travelled
without
her.
and,
the
tax
court
further
found
that
there's
no
question
that
a
man
of
this
modest
means
would
not
have
taken
that
trip
had
it
not
been
for
the
doctor's
advice.
the
question
we'd
like
to
put
to
the
--
and,
before
i
ask
the
question,
in
our
brief
on
pages
25
and
26,
we
pose
two
hypothetical
cases
which
we
feel,
if
the
government's
contention
were
upheld
here,
would
produce
very
inequitable
and
even
absurd
results.
and,
it's
quite
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
this
court
those
cases
on
page
25
and
26
of
our
brief
be
regarded
as
hypothetical
cases.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
these
facts
were
brought
to
my
attention
in
a
letter
from
a
lawyer
named
sherman
r.
burnet
of
winnetka,
illinois
and
he,
himself,
was
the
one
whose
situation
was
described
in
our
first
hypothetical
set
of
facts.
and,
the
second
set
of
facts
relates
to
an
acquaintance
that
he
met
while
at
madison,
wisconsin
at
the
hospital
there.
as
i
say,
i'm
satisfied
that
the
court
regard
these
are
hypothetical
situations,
but
i
add
this
to
show
you
that
the
possibility
of
these
things
occurring
is
not
so
remote
because,
in
fact,
this
is
how
i
came
to
possession
of
the
facts.
so
that,
if
the
government
by
--
as
the
commissioner
has
provided
by
his
regulation,
is
going
to
remit,
let
us
say,
an
individual
who
is
an
athlete
and,
perhaps,
is
having
trouble
with
his
knee
to
go
to
a
hospital
and
to
remain
there
for
observation
and
diagnosis
and
perhaps
nothing
will
be
done
about
it,
and
he
may
deduct
his
food
and
lodging
for
as
many
times
as
he
may
go
for
this
purpose
or
if
they
will
allow
a
boy
who
has
some
psychological
difficulties
to
go
to
a
special
place
where,
for
perhaps
many
years,
an
effort
was
made
to
straighten
him
out,
whether
successfully
or
not
successfully,
and
he
may
deduct
his
food
and
his
lodging
and
his
tuition
there.
how
can
the
commissioner,
in
fairness,
say
that
a
man
like
mr.
carasso
or
a
man
like
mr.
bilder
or
either
of
the
two
individuals
whose
cases
are
posed
in
the
hypotheticals,
that
they
may
not
get
a
deduction
for
that
which
they
--
for
that
expense
which
they
never
would
have
incurred
but
for
the
existence
of
a
serious
physical
condition
and
their
obedience
to
the
advice
of
a
competent
doctor.
the
next
point
which
we
feel
has
not
been
answered
at
all,
either
in
the
government's
brief
or
here
in
the
oral
argument,
is
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
section
213
was
intended
to
be
a
relief
statute
so
that
deduction
should
be
allowed
at
the
very
least
in
the
cases
of
those
whose
hardship
situation
is
due
to
medical
expense
would
otherwise
find
no
relief.
now,
point
three
of
--
point
four,
i
believe,
of
our
brief
goes
into
some
detail
of
this
and
i
will
not
attempt
now
to
restate
all
that,
but
i
do
think
that
this
should
be
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
our
research
discovered
that
there
were
perhaps
some
100
odd
cases
decided
by
lower
courts
and
courts
of
intermediate
appellate
jurisdiction
involving
the
medical
deduction.
this
is
the
first
case
involving
any
question
coming
under
the
medical
expense
provision
to
reach
this
court.
i
think
that
the
medical
deduction
is
one
which,
perhaps,
affects
more
taxpayers
than
any
other
provision
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
more
individual
taxpayers
and
i
think
that
taxpayers
and
tax
administrators,
alike,
will
look
to
this
court
for
guidance
in
the
future
as
to
whether
this
section
should
be
regarded
as
a
remedial
provision
of
the
law
which
is
to
be
liberally
construed
in
favor
of
those
for
whose
benefit
it
was
intended
or
whether,
as
the
commissioner
has
stated,
is
to
be
strictly
construed
against
the
taxpayer
who
is
claiming
a
medical
expense.
much
of
the
legislature
--
legislative
histories
or,
i
should
say,
such
of
the
legislative
history
as
it
is
available
indicates
only
that
this
was
intended
to
be
a
remedial
statue
which
was
to
be
liberally
construed,
and
even
the
statement
of
mr.
fulsome,
which
is
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
indicates
that
that
is
so,
with
respect
to
the
1954
code.
and,
finally,
we
have
raised
this
point.
in
the
tax
court,
it
will
be
recalled,
the
government
was
contesting
both
mr.
bilder's
right
to
the
deduction
for
transportation
and
his
deduction
for
the
lodging.
following
the
decision
of
the
tax
court,
the
commissioner
acquiesced
in
that
part
of
the
tax
court's
opinion
which
said
that
mr.
bilder
should
be
allowed
a
deduction
for
his
transportation.
now,
in
the
lester
case,
recently
decided
by
this
court,
and
a
previous
case,
olympic
radio
and
television,
i
believe
the
name
was,
it
was
pointed
out
that
every
statute
should
be
given
as
much
internal
symmetry
and
consistency
as
is
possible.
we
say
that
if
you
disallow
the
lodging
to
mr.
bilder
in
this
case,
this
statute
lack
such
internal
symmetry
and
consistency
because
if
he
is
entitled
to
deduct
his
transportation,
as
the
tax
court
found
and
as
the
commissioner
has
now
acquiesced,
he
must
have
taken
that
transportation,
by
the
very
language
of
the
statute,
in
--
because
--
as
a
primary
and
essential
means
of
receiving
medical
care
described
in
subparagraph
(a).
and,
yet,
the
commissioner
says
that
mr.
bilder
didn't
receive
any
medical
care
under
subparagraph
(a).
if
this
is
so,
it
makes
--
it
makes
a
completely
asymmetrical
piece
of
work
out
of
this
section
of
the
code.
for
these
reasons
and
perhaps,
more
particularly
for
those
more
fully
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
respectfully
pray
that
the
--
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
i
think,
your
honor,
before
i
can
answer
that
question
i
would
have
to
know
on
what
basis
the
doctor
suggested
that
he
take
that
course
of
--
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
i
would
say
that
if
a
taxpayer
receives
such
advice
from
the
doctor
in
good
faith
on
both
sides,
on
the
doctor's
side,
on
the
taxpayer's
side
--
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
no.
mr.
martin
d.
cohen
i
would
say
that,
then,
he
must
--
he
must
having
incurred
that
expense
because
of
obedience
to
a
doctor's
advice,
be
permitted
the
deduction.
i'm
simply
going
to
say
that
we
feel
that
our
position
requires
that
the
judgment
alo
--
below
be
affirmed.
