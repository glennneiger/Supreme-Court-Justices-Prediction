mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
income
tax
case
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit
whose
decision
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
carasso
case,
now
pending
on
certiorari.
the
issue
is
whether
a
taxpayer
who
travels
to
florida
for
the
winter
months
for
a
heart
condition
on
the
advice
of
his
physician
may
deduct
the
rent
he
pays
for
an
apartment,
while
there,
as
a
medical
expense
under
section
213
of
the
1954
code
or
whether
the
coast
of
his
lodgings
is
a
personal
living
expense
nondeductible
under
section
262.
the
issue
turns
on
a
determination
whether
congress,
in
passing
section
213,
narrowed
the
scope
of
deductible
medical
expenses
for
it
is
undisputed
that
lodgings
on
travel
essential
to
medical
care
were
deductible
under
the
1939
code.
we
will
show
that
sections
262
and
213
leave
lodgings
as
a
nondeductible
personal
living
expense,
that
they
narrowed
the
scope
of
the
previous
provisions
in
the
1939
code,
that
the
regulations
of
the
internal
revenue
commissioner
had
been
consistent
in
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
provide
for
nondeductibility
and
that
the
legislative
history
reads
precisely
on
the
issue
presented
here
and
calls
for
nondeductibility.
the
facts
are
simple
and
not
in
dispute.
the
petitioner
was
43
years
of
age
in
1953
and
engaged
in
the
practice
of
law
in
newark,
new
jersey.
he
had
had
four
heart
attacks
since
1945
and
was
medically
classified
as
a
hyperkinetic
individual.
his
physician,
an
eminent
heart
specialist,
advised
that
he
spend
the
deep
winter
months
in
a
warm
climate
and,
on
this
advice,
he
took
his
wife
and
child
to
fort
lauderdale,
florida
for
the
winters
of
1954
and
1955,
returning
each
spring
to
rej
--
resume
the
practice
of
law.
he
went
to
fort
lauderdale
as
there
was
a
physician
there
qualified
to
administer
a
particular
anticoagulant
drug
that
he
required.
he
also
went
to
--
rented
an
apartment
in
fort
lauderdale
near
a
hospital,
one
of
several
hospitals
there
that
were
qualified
to
supervise
his
taking
of
this
drug.
in
his
tax
returns
for
1954
and
1955,
he
took
the
rent
he
paid
for
the
apartment
--
the
rent
he
paid
for
the
apartment
in
which
he
and
his
family
lived
during
the
periods
as
a
deduction
from
ordinary
income.
there
is
no
dispute
that
he
was
in
florida
as
a
matter
of
medical
necessity.
there's
no
suggestion
that
he
was
there
on
vacation.
thus,
the
question
presented
is
one
of
law,
whether
congress
in
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
afforded
a
deduction
for
the
rental
expense
on
travel
for
medical
purpose.
the
pertinent
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
there
is
no
question
of
the
deductibility
of
the
transportation
expense
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no.
the
--
this
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
there
is
also
no
question
of
the
apportionment
of
rent.
it's
a
pure
question
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
whether
the
rent
is
deductible.
the
pertinent
statutes
in
the
1954
code
are
sections
262
and
213.
section
262
sets
the
framework
providing
that
personal
living
expenses
are
not
deductible
unless
expressly
provided
in
the
code.
section
213,
in
turn,
is
the
expressed
provision
for
deduction,
stating
that
expenses
for
medical
care
shall
be
allowed
as
a
deduction.
it
defines
medical
care
in
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
as
amounts
paid
for
the
diagnosis,
cure,
mitigation,
treatment,
or
prevention
of
disease
or
(b)
for
transportation
primarily
for
and
essential
to
medical
care.
we
believe
that
these
sections
on
their
face
suggest
a
disposition
of
the
issue.
lodgings
are
admittedly
a
personal
living
expense.
there
is
no
expressed
provision
allowing
for
their
deduction
in
section
213.
in
fact,
the
expressed
allowance
of
transportation
expenses
suggests
that
the
similar
expenses
on
travel,
of
lodgings
and
meals,
or
similar
personal
living
expenses,
are
not
deductible.
the
regulations
of
the
commissioner,
since
1954,
read
directly
on
the
point
and
provide
that
the
cost
of
meals
and
lodgings
while
away
from
home
receiving
medical
treatment
are
not
allowed
as
a
deduction.
the
taxpayer
relies
on
the
1939
code
provision
attempting
to
read
and
express
allowance
for
deduction
of
rent
into
the
1954
code.
he
argues
that
lodgings
were
deductible
under
the
1939
code
definition
of
medical
care,
that
the
--
there
was
no
change
in
this
definition
of
medical
care
in
the
1954
code
and
that
congress,
by
its
adoption
of
the
provisions
without
change,
intended
to
continue
the
prior
interpretation
or
at
least
to
prove
them.
the
taxpayer
is
right
in
his
first
contention
that
rent
payments
were
deductible
under
the
1939
code.
there's
no
dispute
on
that.
he
is
only
partially
right
in
suggesting
that
congress
adopted
the
provision,
the
definition
of
medical
care
in
the
1939
code.
it
adopted
the
provisions
but
added
significantly
to
that
and
its
addition,
we
believe,
is
conclusive
here
for
it
provided
explicitly
in
the
1954
code
a
provision
which
was
not
in
the
earlier
code
that
transportation
expenses
are
not
deductible.
the
--
this
provision,
we
believe,
is
conclusive
for
--
in
changing
the
provision
of
the
law,
congress,
we
believe,
made
an
allowance
for
transportation
explicit
and,
thereby,
excluded
the
meals
and
lodgings
which
had
previously
been
allowed.
this,
we
believe,
reasonable
explanation
is
confirmed
precisely
by
the
legislative
history.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
provision
which
is
similar
to
section
262
was
section
24
(a)
(1)
which
provided
that
no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
personal
living
or
family
expenses
except
for
extraordinary
medical
expenses
as
defined
in
section
23
(x),
which
was
the
medical
deduction
section,
justice
harlan.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
taxpayer,
we
believe,
has
no
reasonable
explanation
for
the
change
in
the
1954
code.he
asserts
that
congress
wanted
to
be
positive
that
transportation
expenses
would
be
deductible,
although
also
intending
to
permit
meals
and
lodgings.
it
was
well-settled.
there'd
been
no
dispute
for
a
decade
that
transportation,
meals,
and
lodgings
were
deductible
under
the
1939
code,
thereby,
congress
had
to
take
no
action
but
to
incorporate
the
words
of
the
1939
code
had
it
wished
merely
to
continue
transportation,
meals,
and
lodgings.
it
did
not
do
so.
it
added
an
expressed
provision
for
transportation
thereby,
we
believe,
excluding
meals
and
lodgings.
the
taxpayer's
argument
that
it
did
not
have
that
intention
requires
a
review
of
the
legislative
history,
and
it
is
here
clear
beyond
really
any
doubt
that
this
was
the
intent
of
congress.
in
proposing
the
bill,
the
19
--
that
became
the
1954
code,
president
eisenhower
recommended
liberalizing
--
two
liberalizing
steps
for
medical
deductions,
that
the
ceiling
be
doubled
so
that
each
family
could
take
$10,000
of
medical
deductions
whereas,
before,
it
had
been
limited
to
$5,000.
he
recommended
a
second
liberalizing
step
that
the
threshold
exclusion
be
reduced
from
5%
to
3%,
but
then
he
stated
that,
and
i'm
quoting,
“however,
to
avoid
abuse
in
medical
deductions,
i
recommend
that
the
definition
of
medical
expenses
be
tightened
to
exclude
certain
indirect
travel
expenses.”
all
the
evidence,
and
i
stress
the
word
“all”
is
that
the
tightened
that
the
president
spoke
of
was
to
be
in
meals
and
lodgings.
there
is
no
other
explanation
of
where
the
definition
was
to
be
tightened
if
it
was
not
to
exclude
those
items.
the
committee
reports,
in
turn,
are
even
more
conclusive
if
possible
for
this
is
one
of
those
rare
cases,
i
believe,
where
the
issue
here,
minus
respondent's
name
of
course,
was
posed
and
disposed
of
right
in
the
congressional
reports
of
both
the
senate
and
the
house.
after
stating
this
in
the
reports
that
subsection
(b),
that
is
the
section
added
to
provided
transportation
expense
deduction,
subsection
(b)
specifically
excludes
the
deduction
of
any
meals
or
lodgings
while
away
from
home
receiving
medical
care.
after
stating
that
in
the
reports,
the
reports
pose
this
example
and
i
will
quote
it
it's
quite
brief.
“if
a
doctor
prescribes
that
a
patient
go
to
florida
in
order
to
alleviate
specific
chronic
illness,
to
escape
climatic
conditions
which
have
proved
injurious
to
the
health
of
the
taxpayer,
the
cost
of
the
taxpayer's
transportation
to
florida
would
be
deductible
but
not
his
living
expenses
while
there.
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
judge
hastie,
referring
to
this
history,
stated
that
the
majority
decision
was
extraordinary,
in
that
it
held
that
a
recent
enactment
of
congress
meant
just
the
opposite
of
what
the
reports
and
other
evidence
indicated
was
the
congressional
intent.
the
taxpayer,
in
his
brief,
in
this
court
attempts
to
create
a
mountain
of
ambiguity
surrounding
this
issue.
we
respectfully
believe
that
not
even
a
mouse
comes
forth.
in
conclusion,
the
respondent
complains
in
the
wrong
form
for
congress
allowed
a
deduction
as
a
matter
of
legislative
grace
of
certain
medical
expenses,
certain
personal
living
expenses
which
qualified
as
medical
expenses.
the
taxpayer
has
a
sympathetic
claim
and
complains
or
suggests
that
line
drawing
is
the
difficult
issue.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
line
drawing
is
the
difficult
issue
presented
by
the
claim.
we
believe
that,
here,
the
court
cannot
be
asked
to
draw
a
line
which
congress
drew
and
which
places
the
taxpayer's
claim
on
the
nondeductible
side.
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
would
state
that
if
the
taxpayer's
medical
advice
was
that
he
repaired
a
hospital
in
florida,
his
meals
and
lodgings
provided
as
part
of
the
hospital
bill
will
be
deductible.
that's
stated
in
the
congressional
reports
and
it
is
part
of
the
commissioner's
regulations.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
congress
has
indicated
the
lines
that
it's
drawn
and
that
those
--
it
is
that
line
which
we're
standing
on
in
this
court.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
mr.
cohen's
hypotheticals
pose
the
question
that
there
are
always
some
problems
that
are
close
to
the
line.
it
has
been
drawn
by
congress.
we
are
not
in
court
requesting
this
court
to
draw
a
line.
the
issue
here,
we
suggest,
is
not
close
to
any
line.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
--
might
i
rely
on
the
regulations
which
state
the
commissioner's
position.
the
extent
to
which
expenses
for
care
in
an
institution
other
than
a
hospital
shall
constitute
medical
care
is
primarily
a
question
of
fact
which
depends
upon
the
condition
of
the
individual
and
the
nature
of
the
services
he
receives
rather
than
the
nature
of
the
institution.
a
private
establishment
which
is
regularly
engaged
in
providing
the
types
of
care
of
services
outlined
in
the
subdivision
will
then
allow
the
deduction
of
the
bill
provided
by
that
institution.
and
then,
this
--
this
regulation
endeavors,
i'm
sure
after
a
great
deal
of
thought
and
care
to
spell
out
a
line
which,
of
course,
is
not
an
issue
by
the
particular
rental
of
the
apartment
mr.
bilder
rented
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
and,
he
would
then
be
in
a
home
for
medical
care?
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
in
that
home.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
believe
if
he
is
in
an
institution
and,
therefore,
the
medical
care
which
he
receives
is
institution
bill,
be
it
including
lodgings
and
food
is
deductible.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
accept
your
characterization
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
of
blue
cross
(inaudible)
insured
me.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
know.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
and,
i
haven't
been
so
i
can't
tell
whether
they
draw
the
same
line.
i
wanted
to
address
myself
only
to
one
of
the
points
that
mr.
cohen
has
raised.
the
statement
was
made
as
to
whether
this
provision
of
the
code
is
a
remedial
provision
and
that
this
court
will
lay
down
guidelines
to
which
all
practitioners
will
look.
i
don't
believe
that
the
case
raises
that
issue
and
that
the
question
of
whether
this
is
to
receive
a
liberal
construction
is
raised
for
it
has
been
clear
from
the
history
of
the
medical
deduction
provision
that
it
was
enacted
to
liberalize
the
treatment
of
taxpayers
who
suffered
severe
medical
expenses.
the
question
this
morning
--
this
afternoon
is
only
whether
the
action
taken
in
1954
which
was
characterized
by
president
eisenhower
as
the
tightening
of
the
definition
of
medical
expenses
to
preclude
abuse
is
to
receive
a
construction
which
is
directly
opposite
to
what
the
committee
reports
and
what
the
reasonable
interpretation
would
be.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
is
--
it
is
not
in
our
brief.
it
is
--
i
found
it
upon
preparing
for
argument.

it
