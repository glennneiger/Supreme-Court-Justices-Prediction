john
m.
harlan
was
there
no
comparable
provision
than
the
1939
code
with
section
262
of
the
--
of
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
expressly
provided.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
this
please?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
haven't
got
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
this
man
had
gone
into
a
hospital
down
in
florida,
instead
of
a
boarding
house,
would
he
get
the
deduction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
the
doctor
said
“i
want
you
to
be
where
you
can
press
a
button
and
have
medical
advice,
a
moment's
notice,
and
if
you
can't
get
lodgings
either
close
enough
to
this
kind
of
service,
then
you
better
go
into
a
hospital.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
question
of
good
faith
involved
in
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
(inaudible)
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
hard
for
me
to
make
any
sense
by
distinction
between
the
two
cases.
i'm
not
saying
that
it
makes
--
congress
can
do
whatever
it
wants
to
do
and
it's
still
obvious
that
it
still
doesn't
make
much
sense.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
think
you're
entitled
to
it
and
i
think
you'd
better
walk
that
rope
just
as
straight
as
you
can.
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
blue
cross
draws
this
kind
of
distinction,
too,
doesn't
it?
if
you're
in
a
hospital,
you
get
your
blue
cross
and
if
you're
told
by
the
doctor
to
go
off
in
convalescent
bar
in
atlantic
city,
you
don't
get
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
just
saying
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
never
had
to
use
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
--
so
far
the
eisenhower
statement
is
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what's
--
where
can
you
find
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
