j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
pollak,
how
would
you
answer
mr.
justice
harlan's
hypothetical?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
pollak,
suppose
this
varies
from
mr.
justice
harlan's
hypothetical,
i
gather
from
what
mr.
cohen
has
told
us
that
not
too
many
hospitals
or
something
akin
to
a
hospital
the
same
rules
apply.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
that,
if
that's
so,
suppose
this
was
some
kind
of
a
convalescent
home
in
florida
rather
than
a
hospital
to
which
the
doctor
sent
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
your
position.
but
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i'm
just
interested
what
would
happen
if,
rather
than
to
a
hospital,
the
doctor
told
him
to
go
to
a
convalescent
home
and
he
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
it
might
be
the
condition
that
the
doctor
was
satisfied
required
the
climate
of
florida
but,
also,
the
condition
was
such
that
he
had
to
be
right
nearby
some
care,
not
necessarily
a
hospital
care,
but
that
kind
of
a
professional
care
that
a
convalescent
home
or
otherwise
might
provide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
sense.
