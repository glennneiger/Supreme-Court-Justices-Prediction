mr.
herman
f.
selvin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
review
a
judgement
of
that
court
affirming
on
the
issue
of
liability,
a
judgement
in
the
district
court
in
favor
of
the
respondents
in
a
treble
damage
antitrust
suit.
certiorari
was
limited
to
one
of
the
four
questions
that
were
presented
in
the
petition.
the
fact
that
will
perhaps
become
significant
if
the
respondents
make
the
argument
here
today
that
i
expect
they
will
make.
that
question
stated
very
generally
is
whether
the
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
given
to
agricultural
cooperatives
by
the
capper-volstead
act
is
applicable
to
a
cooperative
organized
as
is
the
sunkist
system
that
is
to
say,
organized
into
three
cooperative
entities
among
whom
are
divided
the
functions
of
processing
and
marketing
rather
than
is
usually
the
case
simply
one
cooperative
entity.
to
put
that
question
in
its
appropriate
setting
and
to
show
that
the
question
in
respect
to
which
certiorari
was
granted
does
in
fact
arise
on
this
record,
something
that
the
respondents
deny
a
brief
statement
of
the
relevant
facts,
i
think
becomes
necessary.
some
12,000
growers
of
citrus
fruits
in
the
states
of
california
and
arizona
are
organized
into
an
agricultural
cooperative
association
referred
to
in
the
trial
court
as
the
sunkist
system.
those
grower
members,
i
might
say,
have
on
the
average
a
productive
holding
of
only
16
acres.
they
organ
--
they
are
organized
in
the
first
instance
into
local
associations.
those
local
associations
in
turn
are
organized
into
22
district
exchanges
and
those
22
district
exchanges
are
the
members
of
a
nonprofit
california
corporation
--
cooperative
corporation,
which
is
sunkist
growers,
inc.
sunkist
growers
is
the
marketing
agency
for
the
fruit
and
the
fruit
products
of
the
sunkist
grower
members.
exchange
orange
is
a
california
corporation
wholly
owned
by
sunkist
growers.
its
function
in
the
sunkist
system
is
to
process
the
oranges
produced
by
the
grower
members
of
the
sunkist
cooperative;
processed
them
into
various
by-products
such
as
juice,
pharmaceuticals,
cattle
feed.
exchange
lemon,
another
california
corporation,
the
stock
in
which
is
owned
by
the
local
associations
to
which
i
have
referred
and
by
the
grower
members,
performs
for
the
lemons
produced
by
the
sunkist
grower
members,
the
same
processing
function
as
exchange
orange
performs
in
respect
of
the
oranges.
all
three
of
those
cooperative
corporations
are
owned,
managed,
controlled
by
sunkist
grower
members,
their
boards
and
officers
consist
of
sunkist
grower
members
only,
they
handle
only
the
fruit
and
the
products
processed
from
the
fruit
produced
by
sunkist
grower
members.
by
virtue
of
the
corporate
bylaws
and
by
certain
agreements
that
have
been
entered
into
between
or
among
these
three
cooperatives.
the
marketing
and
processing
functions
have
been
allocated
within
the
organization.
as
i
have
said,
sunkist
growers
is
the
marketing
agency.
exchange
orange,
the
orange
processing
agency.
exchange
lemon,
the
lemon
processing
agency.
in
1951
which
is
the
critical
year
here
because
it
is
only
in
respect
of
that
year
that
any
antitrust
violation
was
claimed
in
this
case.
in
1951,
the
sunkist
cooperatives
performed
what
came
to
be
called
throughout
the
trial
the
six
acts;
the
significance
of
which
i
think
will
become
apparent
at
the
moment
when
i
state
what
the
charge
was
against
the
defendants.
those
six
acts
consisted
of
these.
that
during
that
year,
exchange
lemon
processed
with
its
facilities
some
oranges
into
some
by-product
presumably
juice
for
exchange
orange.
and
similarly
during
that
year
at
one
time,
exchange
orange
did
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
some
lemons
for
exchange
lemon.
those
are
two
of
the
six
acts.
in
that
year,
sunkist
or
one
of
the
sunkist
cooperatives
entered
into
two
processing
contracts.
one
with
the
concern
called
treesweet
and
later
charged
to
be
a
co-conspirator
by
which
sunkist
or
exchange
orange
agreed
to
supply
treesweet
with
a
certain
amount
of
oranges,
not
treesweet's
requirements
but
certain
amount
of
oranges,
which
treesweet
agreed
to
process
into
single
strength
juice.
for
which
processing,
treesweet
would
be
paid
by
sunkist
its
actual
processing
cost.
and
in
the
same
contract,
treesweet
agreed
during
that
season
in
any
event
not
later
than
july
20th
of
that
--
of
that
seasonal
year,
to
buy
the
juice
that
resulted
from
that
processing
contract
at
sunkist
list
prices
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
purchase,
less
certain
trade
discounts
and
allowances.
one
of
the
allowances
was
a
so-called
advertising
allowance,
the
juice
was
to
be
sold
under
the
treesweet
label
so
undoubtedly
that
designation
for
the
allowance
as
a
misnomer,
it
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
an
additional
discount.
a
similar
contract
was
entered
into
with
the
concern
called
silzle,
also
charged
to
have
been
a
co-conspirator.
now
that
makes
another
two
of
the
six
acts.
the
fifth
and
another
one
of
the
six
acts
was
that
sunkist,
when
requested
so
to
do,
refused
to
enter
into
such
a
processing
contract
with
the
respondent,
winckler
and
smith
citrus
products
company.
and
the
sixth
and
final
so-called
act
was
that
in
1951,
the
sunkist
organization
set
the
price
it
would
charge
for
its
own
oranges
to
be
sold
to
processors
for
processing
in
the
juice
at
$40
per
ton
and
the
allegation,
and
there
was
testimony
to
that
effect,
that
at
$40
per
ton,
a
processor
of
single-strength
juice,
that
is
the
pure
juice
of
the
orange
with
nothing
added
to
it
or
nothing
taken
from
it
either,
could
not
afford
to
pay
$40
per
ton
and
produce
single-strength
juice
which
should
be
sold
at
competitive
prices
during
that
season.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
recess
yesterday,
i
had
completed
a
brief
description
of
the
sunkist
system
and
the
so
called
six
acts
around
which
this
case
centers.
to
that,
i
did
only
add
that
in
the
trial
court,
all
counsel
and
the
trial
judge
agreed
that
each
of
the
sunkist
cooperatives
met
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
capper-volstead
act
for
whatever
immunity
for
the
antitrust
laws
that
act
gave
agricultural
cooperatives.
the
charge
with
which
the
defendants
in
this
case
were
confronted
below
was
of
they
had
done
the
six
acts
in
pursuance
of
a
conspiracy
to
restrain
and
monopolize
trade
with
the
three
alleged
co-conspirators.
treesweet
and
silzle,
the
two
firms
didn't
were
referred
it
yesterday
and
the
third
of
the
sunkist
cooperatives
exchange
lemon
which
although
originally
a
defendant
had
been
dismissed
and
was
retained
only
as
a
co-conspirator.
the
jury
was
told
that
that
was
the
charge.
they
were
told
further
that
they
could
find
that
all
of
the
five
had
conspired,
that
none
of
them
had
conspired
or
that
sum
number
less
than
the
total
had
conspired.
they
were
told
further
that
sunkist
--
sunkist
growers
and
exchange
orange
could
combine
or
conspire
with
themselves
that
there
verdict
should
be
for
the
defendants
exchange
orange
and
sunkist
growers
unless
--
unless
they
found
that
those
two
defendants
had
conspired
with
treesweet
or
silzle
or
the
third
sunkist
cooperative
exchange
lemon.
in
that
way
the
jury
was
given
two
theories
of
conspiracy
from
which
to
ground
liability.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that
--
that
was
not
added.
no
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
--
it
was
in
the
(inaudible)
that
they
conspired
with
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
--
with
the
others
or
anyone
of
the
other
three
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that's
right.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
that's
right.
they
do
not
have
that
immunity.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no.
the
jury
--
the
jury
--
that
distinction
was
not
made
for
the
jury.
in
fact,
that
distinction
was
ignored
for
the
jury
because
the
jury
was
told
that
the
defendant
cooperatives
would
be
liable
if
they
conspired
with
the
third
cooperative,
the
third
member
of
the
sunkist
system,
exchange
lemon.
it
couldn't
have
to
be
a
conspiracy
with
any
outsiders
under
these
instructions.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
the
jury
wasn't
told
that.
they
were
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
what
the
jury
was
told
was
that
they
should
return
a
verdict
against
the
defendants
in
this
one
instruction
or
in
favor
of
the
defendants,
they
should
return
to
verdict
unless
they
found
that
the
defendants
in
the
conjunctive
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
two
defendants,
unless
they
found
that
the
defendants
conspired
with
either
treesweet
or
silzle
or
the
third
cooperative
exchange
lemon,
that
is
the
third
sunkist
cooperative.
so
that
under
that
instruction,
the
jury
could
hand
in
conjunction
with
the
other
instruction
that
they
could
find
that
some
number
less
than
the
total
of
five
had
conspired.
they
could
find
that
the
sole
conspirators
were
the
three
sunkist
cooperative
or
for
that
matter
two,
the
sunkist
cooperative,
because
the
court
put
no
limit
on
the
number
less
than
all
that
had
to
be
in
the
conspiracy
except
that
of
course
there
have
to
be
two
to
make
a
conspiracy.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
sunkist
growers.
sunkist
growers
and
exchange
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
well
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
sunkist
yes,
sunkist
growers
owns
all
the
stock
of
exchange
orange,
exchange
lemon
and
it's
owned
by
the
local
associations
that
belong
to
the
district
exchanges
that
belong
to
sunkist
growers.
there're
all
part
of
the
sunkist
system
so
called,
the
sunkist
system
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
they're
profit
only
in
this
--
they're
profit
only
in
the
sense
that
all
earnings
above
operating
expenses
are
distributed
to
the
grower
members.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
is
not
in
profit.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
the
plaintiff
is
a
profit
company,
yes.
yes,
seldom
succeed
in
making
a
profit
as
the
record
shows,
but
it
is
a
profit
company.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
we
so
construed
the
charge
and
i
think
that
the
charge
necessarily
bares
that
instruction
because
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
we
requested
an
instruction
that
would
have
told
the
jury
that
the
three
sunkist
cooperatives
formed
one
organization,
one
cooperative
organization
and
could
not
conspire
with
itself
or
with
themselves,
that
request
was
refused
by
the
trail
judge.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
it
was
on
the
basis
that
this
type
of
cooperative
organization
was
within
--
within
the
range
of
capper-volstead.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it's
capper-volstead.
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that
was
rejected,
yes.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
in
addition
to
that
--
in
addition
to
that,
we
did
present
an
instruction
that
would
have
told
that
jury
that
should
return
a
verdict
in
our
favor
unless
they
found
that
we,
the
two
defendants
and
exchange
lemon,
had
conspired
with
the
third
parties
treesweet
or
silzle.
the
court
modified
that
instruction
to
put
exchange
lemon
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
equation
with
the
result
that
the
jury
could
pick
exchange
lemon
as
the
so
--
so
called
outside
conspirator.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
except
that
our
position
was
not
quite
that
fraud
your
honor,
which
of
that
cooperatives
that
are
part
of
--
that
are
the
agencies
of
the
same
underlining
group
of
farmers
cannot
conspire
and
we
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
that's
right,
yes
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
we
didn't
contend.
for
instance,
so
we
could
go
out
in
conspire
with
the
walnut
growers
or
the
raisin
growers
in
california
and
that
was
precisely
our
point
and
our
reasoning
in
that
is
this
an
actually
are
reasoning
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
was
--
i
was
being
over
conscious
because
i
know
mr.
dixon
will
tell
you
that
the
charge
should
not
be
so
read,
but
we
take
the
position
that
there
it
is
in
plain
english,
the
jury
heard
it.
it
was
given
to
the
jury.
they
were
told
to
consider
the
instructions
as
a
whole,
and
you
put
these
five
instructions
which
are
exerted
in
our
brief
at
page
18
i
believe.
together,
they
tell
the
jury
very
plainly
that
all
these
five
people
charged
of
being
in
the
conspiracy,
they
can
pick
any
number
less
than
all
as
being
the
conspirators
that
enough,
they
can
pick
for
two
defendant
cooperatives
or
they
could
pick
the
three
sunkist
cooperatives.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
--
as
we
see
it.
now,
there
is
no
question
there
can't
be
any
doubt
it
seems
to
me
at
least
since
the
decision
to
this
court
in
the
maryland
&
virginia
cooperative
case,
that
a
cooperative
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
capper-volstead
act
cannot
withstanding
the
element
of
collective
action
inherent
in
the
very
fact
of
organization
in
existence
of
a
cooperative,
may
do
anything
that
a
single
traitor
could
lawfully
do
without
subjecting
themselves
to
the
sanctions
of
the
antitrust
law.
now,
if
a
single
entity
cooperative
could
have
performed
these
six
acts
without
combining
with
anyone
else
and
it
is
our
submission
that
they
could
have
done
it
because
the
six
acts
are
nothing
but
ordinary
steps
in
the
marketing
and
processing
of
the
product,
if
a
single
entity
cooperative
could
have
done
it,
why
should
not
a
molded
entity
cooperative
like
sunkist
be
able
to
have
--
to
do
it?
after
all,
it's
the
same
group
of
farmers
or
growers
who
own,
control
and
operate
the
organization
whether
it'd
be
one
entity
or
three
entity,
it's
the
same
product
that
is
handled,
and
the
activity
of
processing
and
marketing
is
exactly
the
same
whether
it's
carried
on
by
one
entity
with
the
processing
and
marketing
division
or
whether
it's
carried
on
by
a
processing
corporation
at
a
--
a
marketing
corporation.
when
the
capper-volstead
was
reported
to
the
floor,
the
committee
report
on
the
bill
said
this,
its'
short
and
rather
than
to
try
to
paraphrased
it,
i'll
read
it.
“the
aim
has
been
to
make
the
provisions
of
the
bill
sufficiently
liberal,
so
that
all
cooperative
farm
associations
operated
in
good
faith
for
the
benefit
of
its
members
might
avail
themselves
of
the
provisions
of
this
bill.”
the
bill
does
not,
however,
compel
any
association
to
change
its
present
organization.”
sunkist
and
[inaudible]
entity
form
existed
at
the
time
that
report
was
written,
the
[inaudible]
enter
the
form.
the
congress
was
aware
of
it.
sunkist
was
referred
to
at
least
twice
in
the
debates
on
the
floor
as
an
example
of
one
or
another
kind
of
a
cooperative
organization.
the
aim
is
--
as
the
committee
said
was
not
to
compel
any
association
to
change
its
present
organization,
but
to
make
the
provisions
of
the
bill
available
to
all
cooperatives.
it
is
our
submission,
if
the
court
please,
that
that
aim
can
only
be
achieved
if
the
capper-volstead
act
is
held
applicable
to
a
cooperative
organized
as
in
sunkist
to
the
same
extent
that
it
is
applicable
to
a
single
entity
cooperative.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that's
exactly
one
of
means,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
most
of
respondents
brief
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i
think
the
difference
between
that
in
our
problem,
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
here
we
have
a
statute
importing
a
policy,
intended
to
free
farmers
lack
collectively
from
the
deterrence
of
the
antitrust
laws
may
exercise
on
their
collective
activity.
that's
the
principle
aim
of
the
statute,
that's
the
policy.
now,
what
difference
does
it
make
in
the
light
of
that
policy,
whether
the
farmers
act
collectively
through
three
companies
or
one
company
and
two
affiliates
or
just
one
company?
the
policy
of
the
law
is
different
and
therefore,
the
analogy
i
submit
has
to
breakdown.
i
do
want
to
save
a
little
time
and
i
think
has
come
to
save
it
in
order
to
reply
to
what
i
believe
mr.
dixon's
argument
will
be.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
judge
carter,
james
carter.
i
wasn't
at
the
trial.
all
i
know
i'm
in
the
same
position
as
the
court
your
honor.
all
i
know
about
the
case
is
what
i
read
in
the
record,
but
i
do
agree
with
mr.
dixon
that
the
narrow
issue
to
be
decided
in
this
case
is
simply
whether
the
doctrine
of
intra-corporate
or
intra-enterprise
conspiracy
is
applicable
to
capper-volstead
cooperative.
he
cites
the
keffer,
stuart
case
[inaudible]
decided
a
number
of
others
along
with
it
of
course,
timken
roller
bearing
i
think
is
was
another
one,
yellow
cab
is
one.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
all
that
was
done
in
those
cases
in
respect
to
intra-corporate
conspiracy
was
to
point
out
that
where
there
was
otherwise
an
unprivileged,
in
other
words
a
proscribed
combination
or
conspiracy,
it
was
no
defense
that
some
of
the
conspirators
were
corporately
affiliated.
now,
here
the
affiliation,
the
affiliation
is
the
very
thing
if
i
am
right
about
the
construction
to
be
given
to
capper-volstead,
the
affiliation
is
the
very
thing
that
is
privileged.
it's
the
very
thing
that's
taken
out
of
the
antitrust
law
because
congress
has
told
farmers
that
without
fear
from
the
other
--
of
the
antitrust
law.
they
may
cooperate
or
act
collectively
in
the
processing
and
marketing
of
their
commodities
and
they
may
do
it
through
cooperative
instrumentalities
or
agencies.
now,
while
pressed
several
times,
mr.
dixon
couldn't
quite
bring
himself
to
give
a
categorical
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
the
jury
in
this
case
under
the
charge
as
given
could
have
returned
a
verdict
based
on
conspiracy
among
the
only
the
components
of
the
sunkist
organization.
i
think
his
last
answer
was
in
effect
an
admission
if
that
was
so
he
said,
“well,
probably
they
could
have,
but
they
wouldn't
have.
the
trial
judge
didn't
think
they
never
returned
that
kind
of
a
verdict.”
we
requested
the
special
interrogatories
in
that
case
which
would
have
compelled
the
jury
to
tell
us
who
the
conspirators
were.
the
judge
didn't
give
the
special
verdict,
why?
mr.
dixon
objected.
he
wanted
the
general
verdict.
he
wanted
the
benefit
of
the
blanket
box
that
you
get
from
the
general
verdict.
he
wanted
the
benefit
of
the
cover
up
of
error
inside
the
jury
room
that
you
find
from
a
general
verdict.
the
special
interrogatories
would
have
settled
this
question.
we
didn't
know
who
the
conspirators
were.
we
didn't
know
whether
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
based
on
this
so
called
abuse
of
monopoly
power
and
we
then
could
have
argued
that
one
theory
right
or
wrong,
as
it
is.
we
had
at
least
three
theories
of
liability
go
to
the
jury
like
to
verdict
is
general.
we
don't
know
which
--
which
theory
influenced
the
jury
it
and
as
a
consequence
the
rule
as
well-establish,
the
cases
are
at
page
19
of
our
first
brief
that
in
that
situation
if
anyone
of
the
theories
is
wrong,
the
judgment
can't
be
upheld
because
perhaps
that
was
the
one
that
brought
about
the
verdict.
now,
so
far
as
abusive
monopoly
power
is
concerned,
you
can't
abuse
something
you
don't
have.
there
was
no
monopoly
power
in
this
case.
sunkist
didn't
have
it.
the
monopoly
is
claimed
to
exist
in
product
oranges,
not
the
oranges
we
sell
as
fresh
fruit
but
the
oranges
that
we
sell
to
processors
to
be
processed
in
the
juice
or
to
some
other
byproduct.
the
record
shows
that
we
have
on
the
average
and
in
1951,
we
have
about
70%
of
the
available
product
oranges
in
california
and
arizona,
but
the
other
30%
was
in
other
hands.
it
was
not
under
our
control
and
one
supplier,
the
supplier
with
whom
the
respondents
have
dealt
since
1947
and
who
was
characterized
in
the
record
as
their
principle
supplier,
one
supplier
had
12%
to
15%
of
the
entire
supply
that
was
more
than
enough
to
fulfill
as
it
had
been
in
the
past,
all
the
respondents'
product
--
orange
requirements.
what
happen
in
‘51?
he
clamped
down
on
them.
he
gave
them
6000
tons
of
oranges,
but
under
a
processing
contract
that
required
them
to
process
them
in
to
frozen
concentrate.
he
wouldn't
give
them
oranges
for
single-strength.
that's
what
happened
to
the
respondents
in
1951,
their
regular
supplier.
they
haven't
dealt
with
us
except
to
the
minor
way
since
1947,
but
their
regular
supplier
with
plenty
of
oranges,
he
himself
said,
“i
have
lots
of
oranges,”
this
is
his
testimony,
with
no
home
for
them
except
winckler
&
smith,
case-swayne,
paramount
and
a
few
other
small
firms,
that
was
the
exact
testimony,
6000
tons
of
oranges,
they
got
6000
tons
in
single-strength.
it
was
practically
normal
here
for
this
respondent,
but
their
regular
supplier
shut
them
down
on
them.
for
what
reason,
curiously
enough
because
he
had
sold
oranges
to
case-swayne
to
be
processed
in
the
single-strength
juice
and
he
said
quite
candidly
from
the
witness
stand
is
somewhat
ingeniously
that
he
wouldn't
give
winckler
oranges
for
single-strength
because
he
didn't
want
his
own
oranges
out
in
the
market
competing
against
each
other
in
the
form
of
juice.
that's
the
whole
secret
of
the
lost
to
this
respondent.
sunkist
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
[inaudible].
morgan
ward,
that's
the
supplier
to
whom
i
am
referring,
has
no
connection
whatever
with
sunkist.
sunkist
didn't
even
know
morgan
ward
had
not
supplied
winckler
in
1951
as
he
had
in
prior
years.
now,
that
30
%
outstanding
completely
negates
any
suggestion
that
sunkist
have
monopoly
power.
monopoly
power
by
definition
is
the
power
on
the
part
of
the
monopolist
to
eliminate
competition
at
anytime
he
desires.
winckler's
elimination
couldn't
have
occurred
except,
except
for
the
refusal
of
morgan
ward
to
sell
oranges
for
single-strength
juice
to
winckler,
completely
negates
any
suggestions
that
sunkist
had
monopoly
power.
now,
may
i
suggest
also
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes
sir,
it
covered
everything,
your
honor.
everything
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
verdict
that
they
returned
was
simply
in
used
form
we
find
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
and
it
gives
the
defendants
in
--
in
the
some
over
and
fixed
the
damages
at
$500
--
$500,000
i
think
there
was
in
there.
that
was
trebled
and
that's
the
amount
of
the
judgment,
plus
attorney's
fees.
special
interrogatories
were
requested
but
the
trial
court
wouldn't
give
--
and
the
trial
court
said,
“this
is
the
reason
for
not
giving
them,”
he
just
candid
too.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
but
the
interro
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
new
trial
--
now,
the
case
or
issued
damages
has
always
--
already
been
(voice
overlap)
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
new
trial
maybe
on
the
whole
issue
there
and
not
just
on
the
issue
then.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
what
--
he
said
you
might
find
a
--
you
might
find
out
that
the
jury
--
that
it's
telling
this
with
mr.
dixon
that
you
might
find
out
that
the
jury
found
a
conspiracy
only
with
exchange
lemon
or
words
to
that
effect,
now
i
lead
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
dixon
quotes
part
of
the
statement
in
his
brief.
the
judge
said
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
we're
now
page
3461
of
the
record,
that's
volume
8
of
the
record.
like
all
antitrust
cases
we
have
a
massive
record
your
honor.
mr.
fowl
representing
--
representing
the
cooperatives
said,
“well
if
your
honor
knows,
we
have
taken
the
position
of
sunkist
and
exchange
orange
may
not
conspire
between
themselves.”
you
had
disagreed
with
us
on
that.
you
may
be
right,
we
may
be
right.
if
a
verdict
was
brought
in
for
the
plaintiff
and
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
appeal,
we
will
be
unable
to
raise
that
point
or
preserve
it
unless
we
know
whether
or
not
some
outsider
was
in
this
conspiracy.
we
won't
know
who
the
conspirators
were
at
all.
that
is
the
reason
for
these
interrogatories
and
then
there's
some
discussion
in
colloquy
back
and
forth
about
the
form
of
the
interrogatories,
mr.
dixon
makes
his
objection.
now,
i'm
at
page
3463
and
he
says
--
mr.
fowl
says,
“first,
if
the
plaintiff
will
agree,
all
we
want
to
know
is
if
they
find
the
conspiracy,
who
were
the
conspirators?
mr.
dixon,
why
are
you
entitled
to
know
that?
counsel,
“you
get
your
answer
through
the
verdict”
and
it
goes
on
with
another
comment
which
is
not
material
to
my
point,
and
then
the
court
says,
“it
cuts
both
ways.
i
am
not
saying
whether
i
will
do
it
or
not,
i
may
look
it
over.
it
cuts
both
ways.
if
you
get
a
verdict”
and
he's
talking
now
ti
mr.
dixon,
“if
you
get
a
verdict,
you
are
generally
able
to
sustain
it
with
the
sole
exception
here
if
they
found
only
lemon
was
the
other
conspirator”
and
i
don't
know
how
they
could
find
that.
if
there
was
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff,
you
can
rest
assure
treesweet
and
silzle
will
be
listed
as
the
co-conspirators
and
not
lemon.
now,
i
draw
from
that,
the
clear
inference
that
the
judge
--
the
judge
was
saying
that
if
i
get
a
special
interrogatories,
we
may
find
a
plaintiff
for
the
--
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
here
rest
of
them
a
finding
that
lemon
was
the
sole
of
the
conspirator
and
he
himself
realized
that
that
might
be
a
shaky,
if
not
in
fact
an
impossible
basis
for
the
verdict.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
3463,
the
last
part
--
the
colloquy
begins
at
3461
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes
on
part
of
the
statement
that
i
last
read
is
quoted
at
page
42
of
the
brief
for
respondents.
now,
i
like
to
point
out
that
on
page
8
of
our
brief
and
reply
to
the
brief
for
respondents,
we
have
listed
12
separate
instances
occurring
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
with
the
court
about
to
these
constructions,
where
we
took
the
position
that
the
sunkist
cooperatives
could
not
conspire
with
themselves
and
just
as
consistently
as
we
took
as
the
trial
judge
disagree
with
us.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
trial
judge
submitted
this
case
to
the
jury,
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
under
his
charge,
the
jury
could
return
a
verdict
based
upon
a
finding
of
conspiracy
limited
only
to
the
component
parts
of
the
sunkist
organization.
and
of
that
is
so,
and
i
submit
that
it
is
so,
a
reading
of
the
instructions
can't
lead
to
any
other
answer
then
the
question
that
we
have
here
is
whether
capper-volstead
cooperatives
can
conspire
with
themselves
or
whether
for
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
act,
they
must
be
considered
as
a
single
traitor
and
of
course
there
are
plenty
of
violations
of
the
antitrust
law
so
the
single
traitor
can
commit.
it
is
only
those
violations
that
are
conditioned
upon
concern
of
action
with
others
that
capper-volstead
takes
out
of
the
sherman
act,
or
out
of
the
antitrust
laws
under
our
interpretation
of
capper-volstead.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
do
your
honor,
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
--
i
hope
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
like
mr.
dixon
your
honors
that
i
have
been
some
help
to
the
court.
i
don't
want
anybody
to
be
under
this
apprehension.
i'm
here
as
an
applicant.
as
an
applicant,
i
am
partial
at
one
side.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.

f.
selvin
no.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no.
all
of
the
stock
of
orange
of
exchange
orange
is
held
by

it
is

with
sunkist

the
stock
of

--
all
of
the

is
held
by
the
local

to

mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
sir.
now,
which
we
made
it
--
we
made
all
the
capper-volstead
qualifications.
incidentally
for
better,
we
don't
have
any
other
products
in
our
own
group.
the
capper-volstead
permits
us
to
handle
other
products
up
to
the
certain
limited
and
we
haven't
done.
mr.
herman
f.

a

and
handled
nothing
but
our
growers'
fruit
and
the

processed

your

thank
you,
your
honor.
