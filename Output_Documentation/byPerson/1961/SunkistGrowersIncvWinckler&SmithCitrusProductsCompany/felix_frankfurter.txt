[inaudible]
as
i
can
summarize
as
[inaudible]
stated,
the
jury
would
tell
that
all
the
cooperatives
could
conspire
with
each
other,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
--
all
--
all
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
the
cooperatives
that
were
charged
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
point
is
that
they
couldn't
conspire
with
the
cooperative,
whatever
immunity
they
may
have,
do
not
have
immunity
to
conspire
with
non-cooperative?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
point
of
what
was
before
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
two
--
the
two
cooperatives
could
conspire
so
called,
they
could
combine
with
each
other
so
long
as
they
didn't
combine
with
the
third
cooperative,
is
that
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
instead
of
having
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
waste
your
time
with
my
confusion,
could
you
clarify
it
for
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
--
were
there
any
common
request
on
this
subject?
were
there
any
counter
requests?
were
there
any
requests
by
the
defendant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
bearing
on
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
than
on
the
basis,
was
that
instruction
on
the
basis
that
you
could
rip
the
corporate
veil
of
the
other
two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
it
--
it
wasn't
a
question
of
lifting
the
corporate
veil
but
capper-volstead?
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
and
that
is
rejected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
do
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
your
position
then
is
the
legal
question
in
this
case,
your
claim
that
in
fact
--
the
petitioners
--
petitioners
here
took
the
position
that
cooperatives
protected
by
capper-volstead
could
not
be
found
guilty
of
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
antitrust
act.
and
that
in
fact,
the
charges
that
was
--
the
charge
that
was
--
the
charge
or
charges
that
were
given
or
the
request
that
would
deny
allowed
the
jury
so
defined.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
the
related
cooperative
family
could
not
conspire
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
within
each
other
in
this
need.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
come
to
your
reasoning,
you
said
as
you
construe
the
charge,
a
minute
you
said
that,
is
there
conflict
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
--
that
means
that
the
protection
of
the
immunity
that
capper-volstead
gives
the
cooperative
covers
such
a
cooperative
operating
through
subsidiary
legal
unit,
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
that
doesn't
apply
in
various
branches
of
the
law,
for
instance,
it
doesn't
applied
to
tax
law,
does
it?
for
--
for
merely
for
purposes
of
enterally
organization,
the
chile
copper
company
had
a
--
had
a
subsidiary
and
it
is
argued
that's
all
just
one.
it's
just
like
having
departmental
divisions.
and
this
court
said,
â€œthat
wasn't
apply
if
you
--
if
a
--
if
a
--
another
corporation
for
business
readers,
if
--
if
the
chile
copper
for
its
own
business
reasons
interposes
in
the
comment
of
its
business
is
not
a
department
or
bureau
or
whatnot
but
independent
corporation,
you've
got
a
different
--
legally
speaking,
a
different
thing.
what
application
is
that
to
your
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
discussion
did
it
regard
to
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
the
discussions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
charge
is
delivered,
there
was
a
discussion
as
to
what
should
be
charged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
it
outside
the
hearing
of
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
submissions
--
were
there
requests
by
both
sides?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
discussion
was
in
reference
to
those
submissions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
this
very
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
in
a
word
what
that
means
that
you're
appointed
by
the
court
to
prosecute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
forgot
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
the
--
this
is
your
asset.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
used
to
be
[inaudible]
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
only
reason
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
only
reason
that
the
bankrupt
has?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
interrupt
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
to
infer,
they
said
they
were
content
by
a
charge,
the
jury
may
find
that
the
charge
of
conspiracy
would
be
satisfied
if
any
to
including
two
--
two
cooperatives
conspired.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
that
the
jury
was
allowed
to
find
that
the
main
cooperative
and
anyone
of
its
subsidiaries
justify
themselves
if
they
acted
in
collu
--
cooperation
that
would
satisfy
the
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
it
your
position
that
under
the
capper-volstead
act,
a
cooperative
and
its
wholly
controlled
subsidiary
operating
within
the
scope
of
what
cooperatives
were
allowed
to
do
can
violate
the
sherman
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what's
the
real
issue
then
between
you
and
--
and
mr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
the
order
is
in
long
preliminary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
--
you're
arguing
the
case
in
that.
i
--
i
just
want
to
know
why
if
that's
the
issue
it
can't
be
discussed
instead?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
l
understand
the
claim
now
made
at
the
bar
of
this
court
is
that
the
charge
of
the
court
allowed
the
jury
to
bring
in
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
if
sunkist
and
its
immediate
subsidiary
were
sole
conspirators.
as
i
understand
it,
you
challenge
that
and
that's
where
the
clash
comes,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore,
if
that
was
the
theory
then
the
jury
was
allowed
so
defined
--
it
did
so
define
and
--
and
the
validity
of
that
criterion
for
determining
a
violation
of
the
act
is
here
at
--
in
challenge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
jury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
the
jury
was
allowed
to
find
that
sunkist
and
its
immediate
subsidiary
were
sole
conspirators
and
if
that
was
a
wrong
charge
then
the
verdict
can't
stand,
can
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
jury
--
did
the
jury
bring
in
a
special
verdict
and
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
the
five
are
guilty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
brought
in
the
general
verdict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
for
all
we
know,
they
may
merely
found
those
two
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
the
verdict
must
be
tested
by
the
validity
of
that
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
judge
didn't
restrict
their
duty
to
that
extend,
did
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
he
didn't
restrict
their
duty
to
that
extent,
they
may
well
have
been
within
their
duty
to
find
that
only
two
joined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
no
means
of
penetrating
that
document,
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
question
put
this
in
specifically
as
justice
brennan
just
put
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
he
told
the
counsel
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
upon
the
hearing
of
whole
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
jury
didn't
hear
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
could
they
be
guided
by
that
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
could
the
jury
be
guided
of
they
didn't
know
what
you
told
the
counsel
in
--
their
--
in
their
absence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on,
if
you're
moving
on
something
else,
does
the
general
verdict
cover
all
whatever
charge
may
have
been
made
with
the
reference
to
monopolization?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
monopoly
wasn't
segregated
whereby
they
could
find
separately,
if
there
was
monopoly
even
by
the
corporative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
what
the
reason
--
the
reason
given
by
the
trial
judge
for
not
putting
the
interrogatories?
