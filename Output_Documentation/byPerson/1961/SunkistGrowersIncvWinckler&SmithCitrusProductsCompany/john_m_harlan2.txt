justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
mean
jury
has
found
[inaudible]
on
the
basis
of
conspiracy
solely
and
agreed
under
these
profits
[inaudible],
the
sub-cooperatives?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
still
remains
true
from
what
you
said
and
it
is
highlighted
it
seems
to
me
from
what
you
said
that
under
the
judge's
view,
right
or
wrong,
if
the
jury
could
have
brought
in
a
verdict,
despite
the
way
the
case
was
argued,
is
involved
only
to
the
components
of
the
cooperative.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
is
the
whole
issue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
say
is
in
fact
that
there
is
no
difference
between
a
conspiracy
between
a
parent
corporation
and
so
its
subsidiaries
under
sherman
act,
there's
no
difference
when
it
comes
to
a
cooperative
that
is
organized
in
that
way
because
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that's
the
narrow
issue
in
this
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that's
all
we
have
to
decide.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is
that
if
mr.
selvin's
charge,
requested
charge
had
been
given
so
as
to
take
out
from
the
case
of
conspiracy
that
was
less
in
five
party
conspiracy,
did
you
have
enough
evidence
to
sustain
the
verdict?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that
question
isn't
before
us,
is
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
that
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
supposing
you
prevail
in
this
case,
what's
the
consequence,
just
a
new
trail,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
sent
back
for
a
new
trial
and
otherwise
the
new
trial
would
be
broaden
out
to
include
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that
3461?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
was
any
of
the
stock
of
these
subsidiaries
held
by
outsiders?
justice
john
m.
harlan
100%?
