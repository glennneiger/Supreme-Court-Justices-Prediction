justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
this
is
the
general
verdict
against
whom,
against
to
all
of
the
defendants?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
are
not
mean
as
defendant
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
trying
to
understand
your
position
which
i
--
if
i
gather
correctly
is
that
this
was
really
submitted,
was
there
a
five
party
conspiracy
and
that
although
the
general
verdict
since
only
two
alleged
conspirators
were
actually
defendants,
was
there
general
verdict
against
them?
your
insistence
is
that
in
fact
their
answer
to
the
question
was
there
a
five
party
conspiracy,
yes,
is
that
it?
justice

brennan,
jr.
the
same
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
146?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
set
out
in
your
brief,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
