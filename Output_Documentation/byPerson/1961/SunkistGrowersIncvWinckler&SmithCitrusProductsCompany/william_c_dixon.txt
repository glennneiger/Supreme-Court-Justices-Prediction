mr.
william
c.
dixon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
perhaps
should
say,
at
the
outset,
that
i
--
as
all
argue
is
too
regarded
a
privileged
to
present
any
matter
to
this
court.
i
do
not
feel
that
it
is
a
privilege
in
the
broader
sense
of
the
term
to
have
to
appear
before
in
this
particular
situation
and
as
much
as,
it
involves
10
years
of
litigation
of
a
bankrupt
company
whose
sole
and
only
asset
is
this
treble
damage
action
and
judgment.
now,
therefore,
i
am
appearing
before
you
to
feel
such
help
and
aid
as
i
may
in
helping
this
court
to
reach
the
right
conclusion
in
this
case,
with
the
thought
that
this
litigation
maybe
brought
to
an
end
sometime,
some
place.
after
reading
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
the
bankrupt
acquired
a
victory
insofar
as
liability
is
concerned,
a
further
reading
of
the
opinion
discloses
the
fact
that
we
can
only
look
forward
to
many
more
years
of
litigation
before
this
case
may
be
finally
disposed
off.
we
are
now
hereon
a
question
that
i
frankly
do
not
believe
is
presented
by
the
record
in
this
case
and
i
will
enter
my
--
direct
my
discussion
to
that
point.
before
i
get
in
to
a
discussion
of
that,
however,
i
think
it
might
be
well
to
just
briefly
refer
to
the
question
that
we
are
considering.
it
is
generally
stated
as
to
whether
or
not
cooperatives
can
be
found
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
whether
the
only
proof,
and
my
emphasis
as
i
used
the
word
only
here
if
the
court
please,
that
they
were
engaging
in
processing
and
marketing
operations
under
the
capper-volstead
act.
well
at
first
blush,
i
would
have
to
say
that
certainly
the
capper-volstead
act
gives
all
cooperatives
the
right
to
engage
in
any
farmer
collective
action
which
relates
to
the
marketing
and
processing
of
the
products
of
their
grower
members,
but
that
doesn't
dispose
of
the
matter.
we
still
have
to
determine
what
marketing
and
processing
is
because
section
6
of
the
clayton
act
which
was
the
forerunner
to
capper-volstead
merely
gave
the
growers
the
right
to
combine
together
as
this
court
stated
in
the
borden
case
and
again,
in
maryland
milk
for
the
purpose
of
being
able
to
do
collectively
what
they
otherwise
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
as
single
organizations
either
it's
corporate,
or
a
single
floor
members.
now,
with
that
background,
it
seems
clear
that
under
an
interpretation
of
capper-volstead
act
that
there
is
always
in
the
proper
case
a
question
of
fact
and
a
mixed
question
of
fact
in
law
perhaps
as
to
whether
the
activities
in
which
the
cooperative
or
cooperatives,
and
it
makes
no
difference
in
that
respect,
engaged
because
certainly
they
are
subject
to
the
limitations
provided
in
section
6
of
the
clayton
act
that
those
activities
must
be
directed
toward
the
carrying
out
of
their
lawfully
authorized
activity,
which
are
of
course
marketing
and
processing
of
the
products
to
their
grower
members.
so
that
to
merely
state
that
they
are
engaging
as
the
question
does
here
only
in
marketing
and
processing,
it
seems
to
me
does
not
get
us
very
far
in
solving
the
problem
that
this
court
is
confronted
with
in
this
case.
now,
how
did
this
question
arise
that
is
presented?
it
might
shed
some
further
light
on
it
by
referring
to
counsel's
brief.
on
page
17
and
18
where
they
deal
with
this
question,
they
first
summarized
the
charge
of
the
court
and
this
charge
was
a
long
charge
as
your
honors
know,
containing
some
54
pages,
the
discussion
on
the
instructions
which
preceded
it
cover
424
pages
and
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
a
very
extended
discussion
your
honor
covering
in
this
record
some
424
pages,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
oh
yes,
very
definitely,
yes.
now,
that
was
the
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
both
sides
yes,
submitted
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
to
all
of
these
submissions
your
honor,
yes.
now,
how
did
the
question
arose
--
arise?
before
we
get
to
that
point,
i
think
i
should
say
something
concerning
the
theory
of
liability
in
this
case.
at
the
time
this
case
was
filed
which
is
1952,
the
borden
case
was
of
course
the
only
one
dealing
with
cooperative
exceptions
by
this
court.
that
was
a
third-party
conspiracy
type
of
plaintiff.
when
i
entered
this
case
in
1934,
as
pointed
by
the
court
to
prosecute
this
claim
or
dismiss
it
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
this
very
claim
your
honor,
yes.
i
have
been
associated
with
this
case
now
since
1954
appointed
by
the
court
to
prosecute
this
trouble
damage
claim.
i
have
the
problem
of
determining
whether
or
not
to
advice
the
court
to
dismiss
it
or
to
prosecute
it.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
the
bankruptcy
--
the
court
justice
--
as
attorney
for
the
trustee.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
yes.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
this
is
the
only
asset
of
this
estate
your
honor
of
this
bankrupt
estate,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
that's
why
i
say
i
don't
particularly
regard
as
a
privilege
to
act
--
to
argue
this
matter
at
this
time
not
because
it
isn't
in
fact
a
privilege,
but
for
obvious
reasons.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
this
is
the
only
asset,
yes.
now,
i
wanted
to
avoid
the
presentation
of
any
novel
questions
in
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
event
i
was
successful
in
prosecuting
the
case.
we,
therefore,
have
these
very
extended
discussions
and
the
instructions,
but
the
theory
of
the
violation
here
is
clearly
set
forth
in
the
amended
complaint.
it
was
succinctly
and
clearly
one
of
a
third-party
conspiracy.
that
is
a
conspiracy
to
restrain
and
to
monopolize
trade
and
commerce
in
citrus
juices'
process
in
california
and
sold
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
achievement
or
the
actual
monopolization
of
that
trading
commerce
by
the
combination.
that
was
the
theory,
that
was
the
violation
charged
in
the
amended
complaint,
and
we
went
to
trail
on
that
theory.
now,
that
was
the
theory
in
which
that
broadly
evidence
was
in,
the
case
was
argued
to
the
jury.
counsel
for
the
petitioners
here
insisted
that
the
court
instruct
them
after
he
completed
his
instruction
that
this
was
a
five
party
conspiracy.
in
other
words,
that's
what
we
charged
and
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
that
was
clear
to
the
jury.
at
no
time
in
the
argument
was
there
any
defense
or
any
argument
made
either
by
counsel
for
the
petitioners,
or
for
the
respondents
here
that
this
was
anything,
but
a
five-party
conspiracy
but
it
was
a
conspiracy
case.
it
was
not
an
attempt
to
monopolize
case.
it
was
a
section
1
under
section
2
sherman
act
conspiracy
combination
charge.
that
was
the
violation
charge.
now,
some
reference
is
made
here
about
these
six
acts
and
i
want
to
briefly
discuss
that
because
while,
i
don't
regard
it
as
important,
there
were
important
only
in
this
case
as
far
as
liability
is
concerned
as
being
the
acts
which
the
respondents
claim
were
performed
pursuant
to
the
violation
or
a
conspiracy
and
which
caused
the
damage
claim.
in
other
words,
in
a
government
case
that
this
court
well
knows,
the
only
thing
the
government
has
to
prove
in
sherman
act
case
is
the
violation.
however,
in
a
treble
damage
action,
the
plaintiff
must
proceed
further
and
not
only
prove
the
violation
but
the
commission
of
some
act
or
acts,
committed
pursuant
thereto
which
caused
the
damage
claim.
that's
the
other
element
of
a
--
of
a
--
of
the
case
which
is
present
in
the
private
suit
which
is
not
present
in
a
government
case.
now,
these
six
acts
were
both
evidence
of
the
violation,
but
not
the
only
evidence
of
the
violation
charged.
there
are
also
claimed
to
be
acts
committed
pursuant
to
this
conspiracy
which
caused
the
damage.
we
do
not
have
presented
in
this
question,
the
matter
of
causation
and
other
matters
which
deal
with
--
of
the
petition
which
respondents
have
pending
in
this
court
in
an
effort
to
get
this
case
possibly
disposed
off
them,
finale.
so
we
are
not
commenting
or
discussing
that
at
this
time
obviously,
but
i
am
stating
to
the
court
the
background
so
that
we
can
see
what
the
violation
was
that
was
actually
charged
here,
what
its
theory
was
and
what
the
evidence
was
to
support
that
charge.
we're
not
going
to
go
into
that
of
course,
but
that
was
the
theory
of
the
violation.
now,
we
get
down
to
a
discussion
of
the
instructions,
proceeding
now
back
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
page
18,
may
say
that
this
question
was
created
by
five
instructions
which
were
given
by
the
court
out
of
the
very
many
contain
in
the
instruction.
(a)
is,
first
only
one
combination
or
conspiracy
was
charged.
we
conceive
that.
there
was
never
any
claim
made
that
there
were
several
conspiracies
here
at
all.
that
was
not
the
theory
of
violation.
(b)
was
the
one
were
the
--
i
had
requested
the
instruction
that
a
corporation
and
its
subsidiary
and
that
is
the
legal
status
of
the
defendant
sunkist
and
of
its
subsidiary
exchange
orange
which
was
its
processing
company,
that
they
could
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
namely
the
[inaudible]
and
yellow
cab
could
conspire
together
as
corporations
and
separate
entities
only,
that's
the
charge
your
honor,
to
violate
the
sherman
act.
they
--
they
say
that
that
should
have
been
given,
that
that
was
error.
then
(c)
is
but
not
withstanding
the
charge,
then
they
go
on
to
say
that
the
trial
court
inspected
them,
and
this
was
after
the
charge
and
when
they
had
and
i
had
also
requested
certain
clarification
that
they
have
received
at
this
time
a
clarification
from
a
court
that
this
was
a
five-party
conspiracy.
and
then
during
the
course
of
that
comment,
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
said
that
this
being
a
conspiracy
case.
you
may
find
that
all
conspired
and
none
conspired
or
the
less
than
the
five
conspire.
they
complain
about
that.
they
do
not
say
in
this
brief,
quote
and
this
is
in
the
record
after
that
was
then
given
and
the
judge
said,
“do
you
have
any
other
objections?”
the
counsel
for
the
petitioners
here
said,
“i
think
we
are
content.”
now,
going
to
point
d,
we
found
may
i
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
certainly
your
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
the
judge
--
the
trial
court
didn't
put
it
that
way
your
honor.
it
merely
said
in
--
in
accordance
with
well-established
conspiracy
law,
that
where
you
have
five
persons
or
cooperations
charged
to
have
been
in
the
combination,
while
in
violation
of
the
law
that
the
jury
might
find
that
all
of
them
conspired,
that
none
of
them
conspired
or
that
less
than
the
number
charged
conspired.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
all
the
jury
could
have
found
that
possibly
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
very
definitely
your
honor,
yes.
in
other
words,
that's
i
point
too
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
in
a
sense
it
is,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
in
a
sense
it
is,
yes
mr.
justice,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
well
because
of
the
manner
in
which
the
question
is
presented
here
your
honor,
i
will
be
very
glad
to
cease
discussing
the
first
part
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
i
--
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear,
in
view
of
the
argument
in
the
law
which
the
counsel
for
the
petitioners
have
cited
on
page
19
of
their
brief
here
that
there
was
only
one
theory
of
liability
which
was
submitted
to
the
jury
insofar
as
counsel
for
the
respondents
here
is
concern.
and
it
was
on
that
theory
that
the
counsel
for
the
petitioners
tried
this
case
and
defended
it.
at
no
time
did
they
make
any
defense
except
that
they
have
not
conspired
at
all
with
anybody.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
well,
i
challenged
it
insofar
as
i
say
that
was
the
theory
under
which
this
case
went
to
the
jury,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
well,
yes
it
might
come
your
honor
under
the
series
--
some
number
less
than
the
total
of
five
conspired,
but
that
might
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
yes.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
well,
i
would
say
it
could
your
honor,
yes
on
the
theory
that
it
went
to
the
jury
on
the
theory
that
this
was
a
five-party
conspiracy.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
no,
oh
they
didn't.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
no.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
general
verdict,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
yes.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
that
is
theoretically
possible
your
honor,
but
in
practice,
i
think
the
jury
is
reasonable
men
and
women
sitting
through
this
case
for
period
of
over
two
months,
never
have
the
idea
presented
to
them
by
counsel
for
other
side
that
this
was
anything
other
than
a
third-party
conspiracy
case.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
that's
right.
correct,
on
the
trial
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
yes
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
that
--
that
is
a
theoretical
possibility
your
honor
if
--
if
you
--
if
you
reach
that
point.
it
was,
however,
based
upon
the
premise
but
i
see
it
that
--
that
they
were
--
there
was
more
than
one
theory
of
violation
presented
to
the
jury
in
this
charge.
and
i'm
merely
saying
in
the
54
pages
of
the
charge
as
you
examine
it.
for
instance,
let
--
let
me
just
briefly
refer
to
the
--
not
only
the
charge
in
the
record
of
the
amended
complain,
but
as
part
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
just
the
two
defendants,
the
only
defendants
in
the
case,
yes.
sunkist
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
they
were
conspiracy.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
i'll
be
very
glad
to
go
into
the
reason
why
they
are
but
i
want
to
take
the
time
to
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
that
is
by
position
yes,
sir
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
there
is
no
special
interrogatory
submitted
to
the
jury
here
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
if
you're
interested
in
the
thought
of
the
trial
court
as
to
what
he
had
in
mind,
having
tried
this
case,
it
is
referred
to
in
our
brief.
the
trial
judge
in
discussing
this
matter
with
counsel
said
that
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
in
his
mind
that
if
any
verdict
were
returned
here
by
the
plaintiff
and
special
interrogatories
were
issued
that
exchange
--
i
mean
that
it
would
be
a
conspiracy
between
the
third
parties
as
charged
in
the
complaint
and
it's
argued
to
the
jury
and
it's
defended
by
counsel
for
the
petitioners
here.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
oh
yeah.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
yes,
yes
mr
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
although
the
jury
did
not
hear
that,
no.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
this
is
--
this
only
the
opinion
that
i
have
the
trial
judge
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
they
were
not
guided
on
that
but
the
--
the
jury
were
told
in
the
54
pages
of
the
--
of
the
charge
your
honor
what
the
theory
of
all
the
parties
were
their
contention,
their
defense,
and
the
law.
they
were
fully
advised
concerning
the
exemptions
of
the
capper-volstead
act
and
particularly,
if
may
briefly
refer
to
the
charge
on
--
that
that
part
that
on
3703
which
is
not
referred
to
anywhere
in
--
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
that
was
the
only
charge
or
the
part
if
you
want
to
isolate
it
from
the
rest
of
the
charge
which
pointed
out
the
basis
on
which
the
jury
could
return
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
in
the
trial
court.
and
it
states
specifically
if
you
find
and
i'm
quoting,
3703,
“that
either
or
both
of
the
defendants
that's
3
--
that's
the
sunkist
and
exchange
orange,
these
cooperatives,
combined
with
treesweet
or
silzle.”
that's
the
charge,
the
third
party
charge.
now,
exchange
lemon
comes
into
the
case.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
because
as
part
of
the
evidence
in
support
of
the
violation
may
had
given
this
third-party
treesweet
a
competitor
of
sunkist
in
the
--
in
the
interstate
market
for
citrus
juices
a
special
deal
which
was
of
the
same
kind
that
exchange
orange
had
given
them
on
lemons
and
oranges.
now
i'd
like
to
--
my
time
is
going,
no,
but
i
just
want
to
briefly
if
i
may
speak
of
the
kind
of
contract
because
it
gets
us
back
to
the
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
yes.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
no,
the
juries
have
–
the
judge
did
not
give
that
we
have
an
instruction.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
your
honor,
i
believe
the
court
has
answered
that
question
in
the
maryland
milk
case
where
mr.
justice
black
specifically
said
that
the
maryland
milk
cooperative
and
its
conduct
is
charged
in
the
government's
case
or
compliant
violated
section
2,
the
monopolization
section
of
the
sherman
act.
now,
that
was
a
specific
case
where
a
cooperative
under
that
decision
as
i
read
it
was
held
to
be
subject
to
the
sherman
act
without
reference
to
whether
it
engaged
in
any
combination
or
conspiracy
with
its
competitors,
whether
they
were
third-party,
non-cooperatives,
or
anyone
else.
now,
as
i
read
that
opinion
your
honor,
i
think
this
court
has
already
ruled,
but
big
cooperative
may
violate
without
any
arrangement
whatever
with
sec
--
with
a
third
party,
non-cooperative,
corporation,
or
organization
to
sherman
act.
now,
the
position
of
the
petitioners
here
is
perhaps
more
clearly
stated
and
on
this,
i
wouldn't
beat
the
issue
at
all.
by
their
request
for
instructions
number
4
and
5
which
are
contained
in
page
182
of
the
record.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
they
are
not
your
honor,
no.
let
me
just
briefly
read
this
because
it
states
their
position
i
think
very
clearly.
this
is
one
of
the
instructions
they
requested.
this
is
number
4,
“you
are
further
instructed
that
defendant
sunkist
is
in
legal
effect,”
i
emphasis
that,
a
single
cooperative
marketing
organization
consisting
of
a
number
of
components
including
defendant
exchange
orange
and
alleged
co-conspirator
exchange
lemon,
and
this
is
the
point
and
that
this
cooperative
marketing
organization
being
in
effect
a
single
entity
is
as
a
matter
of
law
incapable
of
conspiring
with
or
within
itself.
that's
number
four.
in
other
words
your
honor
will
see
that
i
think
certain
obvious
things
immediately
that
this
instruction
in
number
five
of
the
--
in
substance
the
same
that
there
can
be
no
conspiracy
and
so
on
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
you
may
not
find
that
there
was
any
conspiracy
in
this
case,
either
a
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade
or
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
trade
unless
you
find
from
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
either
treesweet
or
silzle
was
a
party
to
such
a
conspiracy.
now,
number
five
quite
obviously
would
make
it
impossible
if
that
is
the
law
for
a
cooperative
organization
either
as
a
single
unit
or
as
a
number
of
units
operating
in
some
closely
knit
manner
to
ever
violate
sections
1
--
i
mean
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
the
court
said
that,
during
the
discussion
of
these
instructions,
why
counsel
admitted
it.
counsel
for
the
petitioners
here
admitted
during
this
discussion.
yes,
this
charge
and
this
request
requires
the
court
to
ignore
the
corporate
entities
and
the
corporate
entity
theories
and
the
court
said,
“well,
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
capper-volstead
act
which
provides
for
such
an
exception.”
in
other
words,
on
that
basis
the
court
--
the
trial
court
in
the
discussion
of
this
instructions
of
which
this
have
perhaps
the
key
instructions
on
this
point,
refused
to
give
it.
now,
they
did
give
the
instruction
that
i
requested,
the
trial
court
did
which
was
our
number
two
or
number
six,
on
page
148
which
was
modified
by
the
court,
but
this
instruction
merely
stated
the
law
--
i'm
sorry,
it's
number
two
--'
mr.
william
c.
dixon
no
it's
on
146.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
which
was
based
upon
the
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
no,
it's
not
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
the
keffer,
stuart
decision
which
made
it
clear
that
a
corporation
and
its
subsidiary
could
conspire.
now,
so
you
see
the
issue
is
sharply
drawn
insofar
as
this
particular
question
is
concern
in
the
trial
court.
now,
i
was
frankly
faced
with
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
to
even
waive
that,
but
i
felt
i
have
to
stop
somewhere
and
i
felt
that
i
was
on
solid
ground
in
relying
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
in
keffer,
stuart.
so
the
court
gave
at
my
request
that
instruction,
but
the
point
still
is
if
i
may
go
back
to
it
that
the
theory
of
violation
charged
in
the
complaint
here
and
i
view
to
the
jury
by
all
the
parties
and
contained
i
submit
also
in
the
charge,
apart
from
the
ramifications
that
had
been
referred
to
of
two
or
more
or
none
or
all
might
be
found
of
the
jury
to
be
called
conspirators
or
conspirator
that
the
theory
was
one
of
a
five
party
conspiracy.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
yes.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
and
that
is
the
process
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
that
is
the
sense
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
yes,
your
honor,
i
--
i
say
that
there's
nothing
in
the
history
of
that
act
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
that
is
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
that
is
correct
your
honor
in
that
sense
an
attorney.
if
our
first
decision
is
wrong
that
as
we
think
the
question
is
not
presented,
we
go
to
the
second,
we
meet
that
head
on
and
we
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
capper-volstead
act
which
says
that
the
intra-corporate
theory
of
conspiracy
is
exempted
and
doesn't
apply
to
cooperatives.
if
i
have
time,
i
could
go
in
to
the
facts
here
to
show
that
under
the
theory
of
this
so
called
overall
organization,
this
subsidiary,
exchange
orange,
was
not
suppose
to
sell
oranges
to
anyone
but
the
fact
is
the
contract
show
that
they
did.
they
made
these
separate
deals
whereby
the
oranges
on
the
price
once
having
been
fixed
at
which
they
could
be
obtained
by
purchase,
from
sunkist
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
that
under
the
structure
which
we
are
dealing
with
here,
the
subsidiary
exchange
orange
did
in
fact,
although
it
was
not
suppose
to
sell
oranges,
did
in
fact
sell
them
to
their
competitors
under
the
special
contracts
and
deals
which
i
referred
to
in
this
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
briefly
discuss
the
principle
contract
here,
not
the
only
one
but
it's
a
principle
one
because
it
deals
with
the
product
which
was
not
made
available
to
this
respondent
and
as
a
result
of
which
it
was
forced
out
of
business.
the
treesweet
contract
so
called,
it's
referred
to
here
in
the
brief,
it's
contained
in
the
--
in
the
exhibit,
but
briefly,
oranges
were
first
made
available
to
treesweet,
a
competitor
and
all
of
these
contracts
if
the
court
please,
that
we
are
complaining
about
were
made
with
competitors
of
this
cooperative
in
the
juice
market,
so
that
you
start
with
that
premise
or
that
fact
which
cannot
be
disputed.
so
that
the
oranges
then
were
made
available
to
one
competitor,
under
a
system
and
an
arrangement,
they
call
it
a
purchasing
contract
or
they
call
it
a
processing
contract,
i
don't
care
what
you
call
on,
it's
what
they
do
under
that
contract
i'm
concerned
with,
whereby
they
didn't
have
to
buy
the
oranges.
in
other
words,
they
were
furnished
them.
they
were
paid.
treesweet
was
paid
by
sun
--
by
exchange
orange
for
processing
them
into
juice.
then
they
were
permitted
to
hold
the
juice
that
they
processed
for
their
own
sale,
wanted
to
sell
it
in
the
open
market
under
their
own
labels
in
interstate
commerce,
in
competition
with
the
sunkist
product
and
to
carry
an
inventory
over
the
whole
year.
in
other
words,
it
didn't
have
to
have
at
nine
invested
in
oranges.
they
have
the
product
there
and
as
they
sold
it,
they
have
been
bought
it
not
from
exchange
orange,
although
there's
a
question
about
who
they
paid
for
it
but
they
bought
it
anyhow
from
either
the
subsidiary
or
sunkist.
then
what
did
they
pay
for
the
juice
when
they
brought
it?
they
didn't
pay
the
same
price
after
respondent
had
to
pay
when
it
had
to
go
out
and
buy
the
same
juice
from
sunkist,
in
an
effort
to
keep
its
costumers
and
the
record
shows
this,
paid
the
sunkist
price
to
all
sellers,
but
the
treesweet
price
from
sunkist
was
the
sunkist
price
less
a
15%
discount.
in
other
words,
they
were
paid
for
processing
the
oranges,
didn't
have
to
put
up
any
money
to
get
them.
they
processed
it
into
juice.
they
sold
the
juice
under
their
own
label
and
when
they
sold
it,
they
bought
it
from
sunkist
and
they
bought
it
at
a
price
15%
below
the
sunkist
selling
price.
mr.
william
c.
dixon
oh
very
much
so
your
honor
this
--
mr.
william
c.
dixon
i
must
say
--
that's
why
i
raised
the
question
your
honor.
in
other
words,
what
we
really
have
here
is
an
abuse
of
legalized
monopoly
power.
in
the
first
instance,
it
comes
from
the
fixing
and
they
stop
there.
they
don't
go
on
to
tell
you
that
the
charge
is
the
maintaining
of
that
price
throughout
the
season
in
which
there
was
the
great
--
greatest
orange
price
in
the
history
of
california
and
arizona.
they
maintained
that
price
at
an
immediate
level
at
which
no
competitor,
including
this
respondent,
could
purchase
oranges
in
the
open
market
from
sunkist
or
anybody
else
and
process
them
into
juice
and
compete
with
them,
but
the
competitors
of
the
respondent
and
the
competitors
of
sunkist,
particularly
treesweet
here
was
able
to
do
it.
if
you
read
that
contract,
i
think
you
would
say
that
that
contract
was
a
substantial
value
to
this
co-conspirator
so
that
that
was
the
evidence
here
and
what
we
have
in
substance
under
sec
--
under
the
second
point
is
that
this
decision
in
this
judgment,
i
am
clear
in
my
mind
can
be
justified
on
the
theory
of
the
charges
made
here
as
constituting
an
abuse
of
monopoly
power
it
legally
acquired
in
the
manner
and
method
by
which
the
manner
and
obvious
abuse
is
set
forth
in
the
amended
complaint.
in
other
words,
the
fixing
and
maintaining
of
this
price
in
the
higher
arbitrary
level
that
making
of
oranges
available
to
the
competitors
here
of
the
petitioner
as
well
as
respondents
on
a
basis
at
which
they
were
denied
of
the
availability
to
the
respondent
here.
thank
you.
