if
you
had
--
if
he
had
six
of
them
or
eight
of
them
or
ten
of
them
of
the
same
quality,
you
wouldn't
hesitate
to
take
your
case
on
that
--
on
parallelism,
would
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
had
no
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
haven't
--
maybe
you
have
but
i
have
--
i
haven't
been
able
to
follow.
disentangle
the
--
what
we
call
the
illegal
purposes
of
the
party
and
the
--
what
may
be
the
lawful
purposes
of
the
party.
the
party
as
far
as
i
know
may
be
for
maternity
care,
against
juvenile
delinquency,
for
disarmament,
for
peace
and
all
sorts
of
things.
my
question
is
how
an
association
purposes
that
may
be
up
--
completely
lawful,
could
be
used
under
this
statutory
scheme.
justice
william
o.
douglas
tell
me
again
just
why.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
statute
says
by
aid,
support,
advice,
counsel
or
influence
to
the.
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
communist
party
which
may
have
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
is
that
precisely?
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
--
where
his
advocacy
or
belief
or
what
not
promotes
a
wholly
lawful
phase
of
a
subversive
organizations'
activities.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
de
jonge,
the
man,
de
jonge
undoubtedly
knew
about
the
full
scope
of
the
purpose
of
the
party
but
he
was
held
immune
there
because
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
it
had
--
which
he
attended
was
to
aid
strikers
or
to
give
relief
to
picket
lines
or
something
in
that
category
that
was
wholly
lawful.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
don't
find
it
in
the
case
of
the
report
that
you
--
record
that
you
refer
to
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
because
there
it
says
whether
he
has
been
or
is
or
has
been
innocently
and
knowingly
aligned
with
a
subversive.
now,
de
jonge
walks
into
the
meeting
knowing
what
the
full
scope
of
the
communist
party
program
is,
but
they're
there
that
evening
not
for
blowing
up
things
but
for
promotion
of
a
local
cause.
would
he
be
caught
under
your
statute?
