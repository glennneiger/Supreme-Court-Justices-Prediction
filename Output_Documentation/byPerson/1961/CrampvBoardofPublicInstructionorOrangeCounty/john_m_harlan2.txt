justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
you
jump
the
hurdle,
the
necessity
of
your
argument
of
this
part,
how
do
you
jump
the
hurdle
if
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
in
view
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
which
you
said
that
he
has
never
given
any
such
aid
or
he
had
no
standing
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
raise
a
question,
why
isn't
that
an
adequate
statement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yeah,
but
the
court,
the
florida
court
as
i
read
its
opinion
said,
you
cannot
raise
your
constitutional
objections
to
this
because
you
have
no
standing
in
light
of
your
allegation
with
your
complaint?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
argue
in
effect
that
this
certain
state
ground
is
not
one
that
we
should
recognize
as
an
adequate
state
ground,
that's
the
substance
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
of
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
your
position
was
that
it
might
be
relevant
on
the
question
of
the
state
rule
that
says
that
you
cannot
come
in
and
raise
a
constitutional
claim
if
this
appears
in
the
face
of
your
complaint,
the
--
if
you
don't
claim
here,
that'd
be
personal
injury
--
personally
injured
by
the
claim
if
it's
--
if
by
the
statute
if
it's
enforced
against
you
and
all
you
want
is
a
general
declaration
of
rights
under
the
law.
i
thought
that's
what
you
state
the
supreme
court
had
said.
