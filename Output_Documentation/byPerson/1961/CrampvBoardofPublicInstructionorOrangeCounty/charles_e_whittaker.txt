mr.
wells.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
is
the
heart
of
the
case
for
me
here.
here
is
an
averment
either
that
one
can
or
that
he
cannot
make
such
an
affidavit
in
such
a
case
ever
relevant
in
such
a
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
whether
he
could
--
whether
he
is
able
by
reason
of
his
past
conduct
to
make
the
affidavit
or
he
is
not
able,
is
that
ever
a
relevant
averment
in
a
complaint
in
the
case
like
this?
i'm
thinking
that
if
it
is
then
one
who
doesn't
say
as
this
plaintiff
did
say,
“i
can
honestly
make
the
affidavit”
would
be
presumed
to
be
unable
to
make
it.
so
is
it
ever
relevant
such
an
allegation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
that
quite
another
thing
even
if
these
averments
of
the
kind
made
by
here
by
this
petitioner
in
paragraph
6
on
page
2
of
this
record
are
irrelevant
and
are
not
necessary.
yet
by
making
them,
is
it
true
as
i
understand
your
court
has
held
that
he
has
reduced
his
complaint
to
a
request
for
an
advisory
opinion
and
therefore
has
shown
its
non-justiciability?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
a
different
question
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
even
if
such
an
averment
could
never
be
relevant
yet
one
might
voluntarily
by
allegations
like
those
in
paragraph
6
of
this
complaint,
show
that
he
could
not
be
injured
by
them
and
say,
“i
can
make”
as
he
says
he
can
make
this
very
affidavit
and
therefore
reduced
his
complaint
to
a
mere
request
upon
the
court
to
render
to
him
an
advisory
opinion.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
simon.
is
the
effect
of
that
argument
to
regard
paragraphs
6
and
7
of
the
complaint
as
surplusage?
what
effect
have
they
under
this
argument?
