justice
felix
frankfurter
you
argue
the
oath
in
its
entirety
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
or
you
emphasize
when
calling
our
attention
to
the
oath,
a
particular
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
not
merely
emphasis
but
do
you
say
that
no
clause
of
this
oath
could
stand
or
some
could
but
it's
mixed
up
with
others
that
couldn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
first
one
is
the
--
to
swear
to
support
the
constitution.
what
about
that,
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
conceive
of
even
such
an
oath
that
you
single
out
nobody
in
the
community
except
the
particular
person
or
particular
class
that
you
might
have
a
basis
of
proposition
or
question.
the
second
clause
is
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
would
that
pass
your
scrutiny?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
next
one,
you
have
indicated
that
it's
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
that
i
have
not
--
will
not
lend
my
aid,
support,
advice,
counsel,
influence,
you
challenge
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
next
one,
that
i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
united
states
or
of
the
state
of
florida
by
force
or
violence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
challenge
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
next
one,
that
i
am
not
a
member
of
an
--
any
organization
or
party
which
believes
and/or
teaches
directly
or
indirectly
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
united
states
or
florida
by
force,
you
must
challenge
that
if
you
did
the
previous
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
get
--
focus
my
mind
to
what
it
is
that
i'm
going
to
listen
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
communist
party
ever
appeared
on
the
official
voting
ballots
of
florida?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
you
are
casting
your
net
too
broadly
if
i
may
say
so.
this
court
has
said
again
and
again
that
if
a
particular
individual
himself,
a
particular
individual
himself
could
not
be
affected
by
a
statute,
he
can
claim
injury
on
behalf
of
others
who
might
be
in
the
same
class,
but
were
not
excluded
by
the
record
filed.
i
think
of
the
case
in
204
u.s.
i
think
of
a
lot
of
cases
to
which
this
court
has
said
(inaudible)
if
somebody
who
is
hurt
by
this.
i
think
the
ground
as
you
--
as
you
put
it
that
he
represents
the
class.
he
doesn't
represent
a
class
if
he
is
in
a
class
by
himself.
why
does
he
put
that
into
his
pleading?
i'm
not
saying
--
i'm
not
suggesting,
to
be
clear
about
it
that
--
that
an
argument
can't
be
made
but
not
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
simply
because
he
is
in
a
class.
the
point
is
he
has
taken
himself
out
of
the
class.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
to
go
to
the
--
perhaps
one
ought
to
hear
your
objection,
if
you
go
to
the
objection
of
such
a
class,
the
objection
namely
that
they
can
search
way
back
into
his
life,
i
don't
know
how
many
years
back,
that's
why
i
asked
you
when
the
communist
party
was
established.
he
is
in
florida
or
he
may
have
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
suppose
he
take
judicial
notice
that
--
that's
got
on
the
way
1919
or
1920
which
puts
a
judicial
notice
and
the
litigant
party
came
in
to
being,
your
argument
then
is
(inaudible)
that
that
means
that
he
did
anything
from
1920.
and
thereafter,
did
everything
to
oppose
that
which
he
did
in
1920,
he
still
would
be
within.
but
if
a
man
takes
himself
out
of
the
class
but
there's
no
such
danger,
then
i
don't
think
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
is
adequate
that
he
is
in
that
class.
the
point
is
he's
not
in
that
class
because
he's
taken
himself
out
of
that
class.
i
think
there
are
other
objections
possibly
but
not
your
objection
that
he's
in
that
class.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
nothing
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
a
question
of
doubt
in
our
minds.
it's
a
question
of
a
litigant
asking
for
a
leave
on
the
basis
he's
hurt
by
something
and
he
says,
“i
haven't
been
hurt
by
this.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
accept
your
starting
point,
you
see.
i
can
well
understand
that
a
man
like
torcaso
can
file
or
his
lawyer
can
file
a
complaint
in
which
he
said
this
is
of
no
hurt
to
me.
it
couldn't
possibly
make
any
difference
to
me
to
sign
it.
i'd
be
glad
to
sign
it
but
i
just
want
to
get
a
ruling
from
this
court
on
whether
such
a
statute
is
constitutional.
speaking
for
myself,
i
have
the
greatest
doubt,
but
i
would
think
that
presents
the
case
of
controversy
before
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
not
a
guarantee
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you're
talking
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you're
talking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
talk
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
very
different
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
the
one
that
you
thought
was
conclusive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
he
might
sign
this
oath
and
he
might
subject
himself
to
prosecution
of
perjury
and
then
at
least
would
have
to
litigate
whether
what
he
did
not
40
years
ago
but
two
years
ago
could
be
regarded
on
the
appropriate
charge
by
a
judge
to
a
jury
as
bringing
himself
within
these
terms
support,
advice,
counsel
and
influence
to
deny
that
and
therefore
it's
a
case
of
perjury.
now,
i
understand
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
are
you
suggesting
it's
far
a
field
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
i
want
to
know
--
what
arguments
imply.
you're
suggesting
that
a
state
university
could
not
avow
refusing
to
employ
a
conscientious
believer
in
christian
science
to
its
medical
faculty,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
i
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
that
the
state
of
florida
can't
refuse
to
employ
a
plumber
on
its
law
faculty
because
he
is
expected
to
know
about
law,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
first
--
we'll
reject
the
whole
basis
on
which
a
medical
school
is
conducted
for
good
or
bad
reasons,
is
violating
--
the
state
is
violating
the
first
amendment.
i
think
you'd
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you'd
get
more
mileage
if
you
went
down
with
some
another
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
understand
why
on
your
theory,
you
do
not
challenge
the
requirement
of
denial
to
become
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
are
challenging
the
force
and
violence
part
of
this
oath.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you're
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
you
challenge
the
clause
that,
“i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
united
states
by
force
or
violence.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
florida
can
refrain
to
appoint
somebody
to
teach
civics
that
it
has
called
in
so
many
institutions
who
says,
“i
firmly
believe
--
i
do
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
united
states
by
force
or
violence.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
you
quite.
suppose
this
oath
was
submitted
to
somebody
who
satisfies
all
the
requirements;
all
the
other
intellectual
requirements
for
having
him
to
teach
civics
to
the
institutions
of
florida
but
he
says,
“i
cannot
conscientiously
sign
the
clause
concerning
the
oath
if
it
contains
the
clause,
i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
because
i
do
believe
in
it.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
let's
see
if
i
understand,
if
it
--
if
a
teacher
to
be
hired
for
civics
could
be
required
to
sign
this,
but
a
teacher
of
mathematics
could
not.
is
that
the
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
i
am
assuming
that
they've
put
him
through
the
ropes
as
to
where
he
studied
and
what
books
he's
read
and
all
the
rest
and
also
this
that
you
must
sign
an
oath
that
you
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
you
say
that's
alright,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
is
it
alright?
is
any
time
alright?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
let
me
ask
you
again.
if
a
person
is
under
consideration
to
teach
and
to
be
employed
as
a
teacher
of
civics
in
a
florida
institution,
high
school
or
college,
and
he
has
to
sign
an
oath,
i
do
believe
–
i
do
not
believe
in
the
oath
of
the
government
of
united
states
by
force
or
violence,
may
the
state
exact
such
an
oath
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
of
--
do
you
think
a
man's
conviction
of
what
he
promises
to
carry
out
--
about
what
he
promises
to
carry
out
has
no
relation
to
the
reliance
one
can
place
upon
his
capacity
to
carry
out
or
to
be
subject
to
carry
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
we've
had
a
great
deal
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
talk
about
that
to
the
contrary.
we
want
people
actually
to
believe
certain
things
as
an
assurance
that
they
will
see
to
it
that
having
power,
they
will
carry
that
duty
into
action.
do
you
think
men
are
(inaudible)
like
that
if
they
say,
“i
will
do
this
--”
you
can
count
on
him
to
do
it
although
he
pleaded
the
opposite?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
count
on
that
no
matter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
ultimately
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
may
be
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
a
man's
belief
regarding
the
ultimate
mysteries
of
the
universe.
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
that
a
man
who
is
charged
with
a
duty
shouldn't
be
expected
while
legislation
is
written.
we
have
a
number
of
enactments
of
congress,
the
pva
i
believe
is
one,
justice
black
will
correct
me,
but
i
think
that's
one
if
the
person
to
be
appointed
by
the
president
should
be
a
man
who
has
faith
and
conviction
in
the
particular
enterprise
and
therefore
as
an
extra
energetic
impulse
to
carry
out
that
enterprise,
isn't
that
true?
i
believe
that's
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
are
several
such
things
that
the
appointees
by
the
president
should
be
people
who
believe
in
the
policy
which
they're
called
upon
to
execute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
simon
does
a
(inaudible)
--
if
one
takes
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution,
he
takes
an
oath
to
support
the
whole
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
one
of
the
important
provisions
of
the
constitution
is
the
mode
by
which
things
you
don't
like
in
the
constitution
can
be
taken
out
of
the
constitution
and
the
mode
in
the
constitution
which
is
set
forth
is
that
changes
must
be
made
in
an
orderly
way
and
not
by
force
and
violence.
and
you
say
that
a
state
can
say
that
you
must
at
least
agree
that
the
changes
that
you
want
to
have
come
into
being,
the
things
you
don't
like
--
you
don't
have
to
like
everything
in
the
constitution,
but
there's
a
provision
the
constitution
which
says
if
you
don't
like
it
then
get
busy
and
get
it
repealed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
you
say
a
state
cannot
ask
a
man
to
say,
“i
believe
in
the
constitution
including
that
provision
of
it
that
the
things
you
want
to
take
out,
you
should
take
out
by
reason
and
votes
and
not
by
force,”
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
argument.
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
a
man
can
shout
from
his
--
from
the
house
top
that
he
doesn't
like
being
compelled
and
he
can
shout
from
the
house
top
that
he
thinks
it
was
a
great
mistake
to
give
the
women
to
vote,
that
doesn't
mean
he
can
go
out
and
smash
things
up
because
the
constitution
indicated
how
he
can
bring
his
disagreements
with
specifics
into
--
into
realization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
knowing
everything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
about
mr.
cramp.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it
doesn't
prevent
anybody
from
expressing
the
most
vehement
disagreement
with
any
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
and
yet
to
require
him
to
say
that
he
wants
the
change
made
by
the
way
in
which
the
constitution
has
indicated
changes
should
be
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody
has
been
asking
you
to
say
that
he
believes
in
all
the
laws
of
the
state
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
believing
in
the
constitution
is
a
very
different
thing
because
that's
an
organic
document
which
has
the
means
of
some
correction
within
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
statute
doesn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
present
company?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
every
provision
the
constitution
has
an
amendment
written
into
it
that
if
you
don't
like
it
get
it
repealed.
that's
also
part
of
every
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wells.
justice
felix
frankfurter
forgive
me
for
interrupting
you.
i
didn't
hear
mr.
simon
in
the
course
of
the
argument
raise
the
question
of
scienter
so
i
assumed
you
accept
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
accept
the
state
court's
decision
that
scienter
is
to
be
read
into
the
statute
and
therefore
the
statute
comes
here
with
that
--
with
that
authoritative
interpretation
of
your
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wonder
whether
your
appeal
must
be
taking
your
time
to
answer
an
argument
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
it's
been
abandoned
but
he
just
accept
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
argue
what
you
call
a
subsidiary
point
that
in
case
he
is
in
no
position
that
the
stand
--
put
the
standing
problem
to
one
side?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
assume
it
weren't
in
this
case,
i
understood
you
to
say
a
minute
ago
that
if
that
were
so,
you
would
also
defend
--
you
would
defend
the
power
of
florida
that
as
–
(inaudible)
anybody
else
whom
it
appoint
but
assume
a
teacher,
but
i
have
not
--
will
not
lend
my
aid
and
support,
advice
to
the
communist
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
what
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
get
a
license
to
be
a
hawker.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question
mr.
wells.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
your
state
university
is
dependent
on
state
funds
for
its
activities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
mr.
simon
said
there
never
was
a
communist
party
on
the
electoral
ticket
in
florida.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
the
communist
party
of
united
states
in
1924
or
1925
found
out
that
there
was
a
campaign
on
to
increase
the
appropriations
for
the
university
of
florida,
to
double
the
appropriations
of
the
previous
years,
i
don't
know
whether
they
did
it
one
year
or
two
years.
two
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there
was
up
a
referendum
to
issue
bonds
to
double
the
appropriations
to
the
university
of
florida,
and
suppose
the
communist
party
had
sent
in
its
most
vocal
leaders
to
support
such
an
amendment
and
made
a
lot
of
noise
in
support
of
it.
and
suppose
some
members
of
the
faculties
in
university
of
florida
were
on
the
same
platform
with
the
communist
party
leader,
solely
--
had
a
meeting
solely
restricted
to
promoting
the
adoption
of
that
bond
issue
amendment.
now
it
could
be
argued
that
thereby
he
was
aiding
--
couldn't
it
be
argued
that
he
was
aiding
or
couldn't
it
be
fairly
argued
that
that
was
an
aid
of
the
communist
party
because
he
lent
his
prestige
and
his
respectability,
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera.
couldn't
that
be
argued?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
you
say
you
doubted
it,
i
--
am
i
--
is
it
fair
to
imply
that
it
would
raise
a
question
and
a
conscientious
lawyer
could
argue
that's
an
aid?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
all
events,
it
isn't
like
the
hawker
case
or
the
deveau
case
where
the
court
had
before
it
the
consequences
that
a
state
may
be
allowed
to
draw
from
a
criminal
conviction
and
the
relation
of
such
a
criminal
conviction
to
a
subsequent
position
of
responsibility.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
only
meant
words
like
aid
or
support,
for
instance,
support
if
a
distinguished
member
of
the
university
of
florida
is
on
the
same
platform
under
the
auspicious
of
the
communist
party
sponsoring
increased
appropriations
for
the
university.
it
could
be
a
man
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
look
ridiculous
or
wouldn't
be
left
out
of
the
court
if
he
was
totally
supporting
the
communist
party,
would
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
--
mr.
wells.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
trouble
is
in
your
--
in
your
fair
mind
and
conscientious
way,
you
have
a
like
to
say
you
don't
believe
it,
but
the
difficulties
that
i
had
and
why,
it
has
simply
been
--
what
was
it,
updegraff
and
wieman
or
the
other
way
around
or
was
it
a
conscientious
man
taking
an
oath
wouldn't
know
what
he
was
taking
an
oath
to.
he
might
say,
well,
i'm
--
he
--
i
was
once
on
a
platform
with
foster
or
what's
the
other
fellow's
name,
the
leader
and
i
don't
know
if
i
swear,
i
never
did.
it
might
hold
me
up
one
of
these
days
and
said,
“well,
weren't
you
the
chairman
of
the
meeting
at
which
--
with
you
meeting
foster,
you
made
a
(inaudible)
haranguing
speech?
he
wouldn't
know,
would
he?
i
mean
a
conscientious
man,
particularly
if
he
isn't
a
lawyer
hasn't
the
great
advantage
that
you
and
i
have
of
knowing
how
we
play
with
words
in
the
law,
he
might
pause,
wouldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
you're
asking
him
to
swear
to
this
thing
and
i'm
just
putting
it
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
i
know,
with
knowledge.
he
has
all
the
knowledge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
i
was
on
that
platform
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
from
personal
experience,
i
was
once
a
chairman
at
a
meeting
in
boston
way
back,
and
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
was
to
urge
the
government
of
united
states
to
recognize
the
soviet
country,
the
present
regime
in
russia
long
before
we
did.
and
we
had
all
the
parts
of
it
or
mix
bag
of
speakers.
and
i
can
assure
you
all
sorts
of
inferences
that
might
seem
to
you
and
did
to
me
at
the
time
ludicrous
could
be
drawn
from
such
chairmanship,
was
drawn.
now,
if
i
have
to
swear
lawyer
that
i
am,
if
i
had
to
swear
that
i
never
hated
the
communist
party
because
of
the
communist
speaker
at
that
meeting,
in
nathaniel
hall
or
it
was
faneuil
hall,
the
cradle
of
liberties
so-called,
i
would
fall
even
as
a
lawyer
in
saying
i
don't
want
to
be
--
oh
yes,
i
know
that
i
could
not
know
sensible
juries
convict
me
but
then
juries
aren't
always
sensible,
no
supreme
court
would
sustain
the
conviction
but
then
the
supreme
court
aren't
always
sensible
at
least
in
the
eyes
of
the
various
people
in
distant
times.
it's
a
problem
that
confronts
the
man
who's
asked
to
take
an
oath
which
has
these
dubious
possibilities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
your
--
it
wouldn't
--
doesn't
it
make
a
difference
how
--
how
needed
this
is,
how
essential
this
is
to
protect
the
interest
that
you
have
a
right
to
protect
from
my
point
of
view.
it
means
at
any
time.
suppose
you
say
--
if
it's
scienter,
suppose
you
say
it
makes
a
difference
whether
its
40
years
or
two
years
or
three
years
or
five
years,
doesn't
it?
and
when
you
have
a
territory
where
conscientious
men
may
forge
long
before
they
sign
in
the
affidavit
which
has
potentialities
of
perjury
in
the
system,
i
don't
mean
conscious
perjury
but
you've
got
a
problem,
haven't
you?
at
least
that's
what
--
that's
what's
we
had
in
wieman
against
updegraff
and
you
have
to
hurdle
that
case,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wells,
my
narrow
point
is
this
that
if
you
were
defending
this
man
in
the
hypothesis
put,
i'm
confident
if
you
let
me
say
so
that
you
get
them
all
but
you
might
not,
you
might
not.
a
perfectly
clear
cut
case
have
reached
--
have
led
the
men
in
the
jury
box
to
reach
a
different
conclusion
and
i'm
suggesting
that
a
lot
of
school
teachers
who
aren't
versed
in
the
dialectics
of
the
law
might
feel
queasy
and
(inaudible)
naturally
and
justifiably
queasy
about
running
an
affidavit
that
might
lead
them
into
--
into
criminal
--
into
a
criminal
prosecution
even
if
they're
usually
the
defendant
and
whereas
such
a
risk
--
such
a
risk
can
be
unfold
upon
by
the
state,
it
is
as
narrow
as
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
--
it
shouldn't
be
fatal
to
the
statute
if
you
can
give
a
really
strong
weighty
counter
consideration
why
this
is
the
way
that
a
reasonable
legislature
must
deal
with
the
problem
with
which
it
has
a
right
to
deal
with,
namely,
that
puts
no
time
limit,
refuses
voguish
words
which
is
susceptible
of
ambiguous
construction
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
with
you
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
much
more
definite
than
this,
isn't
it
mr.
wells?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
a
man
has
been
a
member
of
a
party
--
there
isn't
much
room
for
a
debate
about
that.
there
is
some.
i'm
not
unaware
of
it
but
not
--
nothing
like
aid,
support,
what
is
it?
influence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
counsel.
those
are
--
those
of
(inaudible)
words.
those
are
the
grab
bag
words,
aren't
they?
i
don't
mean
they
were
grab
bag
but
they're
--
they're
words
of
breadth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
made
an
influence
on
ethnic
--
aren't
words
of
ours,
are
they,
influence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
dale
carnegie
uses
them
in
a
different
sense,
doesn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wells,
there
is
a
difference,
isn't
there
between
a
man
coming
in
to
court
and
say,
“i'm
asked
to
sign
a
document.
you
have
no
business
to
ask
me.
i
signed
it
and
therefore
i
ask
you
to
strike
it
down”
and
a
man
saying,
“you're
asking
me
to
sign
a
document.
i'm
perfectly
ready
to
sign
it
or
it
doesn't
cause
me
any
kind
of
recognizable
harm
to
sign
it
but
i'd
like
to
have
the
court
to
make
a
ruling
on
this
question.”
there
is
a
difference
between
those
two
situations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
this
is
a
good
situation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
think
it
is
but
there
is
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wells,
isn't
the
truth
of
the
matter
just
as
interpreting
what
this
really
means,
i
haven't
--
i
don't
live
inside
of
the
mind
or
the
threat
or
with
the
constraints
but
he's
trying,
quite
understandably,
he's
trying
to
ride
through
horses
which
is
a
feat
that's
not
too
impossible.
he's
trying
to
say,
“it's
none
of
your
business
to
ask
me
these
questions
but
i
don't
want
to
appear
--
i
want
to
appear
in
the
best
possible
life.
so
i
disavow
having
done
any
of
the
things
that
are
disapproved
by
the
oath.
he
decides
to
do
both
those
things.”
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
vice
of
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
fatally
indefinite,
i
think
if
i
may
say
so
you're
conjoining
two
very
different
things.
the
statute
isn't
indefinite
to
defend
that
--
one
doesn't
know
what
it
means.
it's
often
when
one
does
know
what
it
means,
it
raises
difficulties
which
--
while
we're
here
which
raises
a
constitutional
question
whether
you
have
a
right
to
put
a
man
in
that
situation.
it's
perfectly
plain
what
it
means
namely
that
you
mustn't
have
been
guilty
of
--
you
mustn't
have
conducted
yourself
or
to
bring
yourself
within
any
of
these
rubrics.
the
trouble
is,
as
is
pointed
out
several
times
in
the
course
of
this
argument,
this
may
subject
him
in
a
lawsuit
and
everybody
knows
that
the
lawsuit
is
a
gamble.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wells.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
i
think
i've
been
talking
a
little
bit
at
large
as
to
what
the
complaint
says
and
what
the
courts
held.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
be
sure,
paragraph
7,
the
complaint
says,
the
plaintiff
is
a
loyal
american
and
does
not
decline
to
execute
(inaudible)
oath
of
fear
of
the
penalty
provided
by
law
of
false
oath.
and
then
it
goes
on
in
the
next
paragraph
and
says,
“nevertheless
he
objects
to
it”
because
to
require
him
to
swear
that
he
has
not
lent
aid,
support
etcetera,
brings
him
in
the
violation
of
the
due
process
of
law.
he
doesn't
spell
out
why
it's
a
due
process
of
law,
but
he
has
a
right
not
to
foreclose
in
making
any
proper
inferences
drawn
from
the
(inaudible)
of
what
he
does.
now,
your
supreme
court
didn't
say,
which
for
me
would
make
a
very
difference
--
it'd
be
a
different
case,
your
supreme
court
doesn't
--
hasn't
said
that
in
view
of
paragraph
7,
despite
his
reliance
on
due
process,
he
has
said
in
effect
that
i
have
no
concern
with
the
consequences
of
signing
this
oath.
i'm
not
worried
that
any
jury
in
florida
would
--
could
construe
such
an
oath
by
lending
aid
and
support,
except
to
mean
that
i
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
that
i
have
a
definite
organic
relation
with
the
party.
and
if
he
wanted
to
say
that
then
under
florida
law,
it
should
have
been
more
particular.
for
myself,
i
think
florida
can
--
if
he
chooses
to
continue
the
common
law
pleading
which
strict
--
with
all
the
strict
technicalities
of
that
system
of
pleading.
all
your
supreme
court
had
said
was
this,
“by
the
allegations
of
his
complaint,
the
appellant
under
oath
affirmatively
denied
any
present
or
past
associations
which
would
preclude
him
from
executing
the
subject
oath.”
he
stated
in
his
complaint
quote,
“that
he
has
not,
does
not
and
will
not
lend
aid,
support
or
advice,
counsel
or
influence
the
communist
party.”
that's
all
i
find
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
you
point
out
some
things
that
i've
missed
as
well
i
might
have.
and
therefore,
all
they
gather
from
his
disavow
is
that
he
was
not
--
that
he
did
not
have
present
or
past
association
with
the
communist
party.
now,
that
for
me
still
leaves
open
the
danger
he
runs
of
having
perfectly
innocent
constitutionally
allowable
conduct
interpreted
by
a
jury
with
the
finding
that
he
did
give
aid
or
support.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i've
been
reading
from.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
just
what
i've
been
reading
from
mr.
wells
and
that's
all
i
find.
for
myself,
i
think
states
can
be
as
pugnacitive
as
they
want
to
be
so
long
as
they
don't
use
pugnacities
as
a
means
of
defeating
federal
rights
because
they
can
be
as
exacting
as
they
plead
in
pleadings,
but
i
don't
find
that
the
supreme
court
here
has
made
any
such
ruling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
simon
before
you
sit
down,
in
view
of
the
breadth
of
your
argument
remain,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
namely
that
no
belief
can
constitutionally
be
inquired
as
to
anybody
who
seeks
office
under
the
united
states
or
state
government,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
let
me
put
a
case
that
is
in
regard
to
the
president.
the
thing
i
referred
to
you
but
i
didn't
have
the
text
before
me.
the
tva
act
has
this
provision,
all
members
of
the
board
shall
be
persons
who
profess
a
belief,
just
listen
in
what
(inaudible)
this
professor
believes
in,
you
must
profess
a
belief
in
the
feasibility
and
wisdom
of
this
act.
i
gather
from
your
argument
as
an
unconstitutional
assertion
of
power
by
the
president
--
by
the
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
our
argument
either
--
argument
either
have
relevance
or
they
don't
have
relevance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
lawyer
says
that
a
government
can't
ask
its
appointees
whether
they
have
a
belief
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
its
entirety
or
a
belief
in
an
act
under
which
they're
supposed
to
act
or
belief
in
the
law
and
the
members
of
the
law
faculty
then
i
have
a
right
to
put
you
a
concrete
case
in
order
to
test
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
that's
an
unconstitutional
provision
in
the
tva.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
