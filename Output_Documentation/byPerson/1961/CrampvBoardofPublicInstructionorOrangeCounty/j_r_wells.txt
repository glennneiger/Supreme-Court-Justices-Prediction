mr.
j.
r.
wells
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
will
be
my
purpose
to
take
up
the
several
clauses
of
this
oath
one
by
one
but
before
i
do,
i
want
to
call
particular
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
the
kind
of
situation
that
was
involved
in
the
wieman
versus
updegraff
where
scienter
was
construed
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
as
not
being
implied
in
the
oklahoma
statute
because
both
prior
to
the
time
this
oath
was
submitted
to
mr.
cramp
for
execution
and
in
the
course
of
this
case,
the
supreme
court
as
well
as
the
trial
court
here,
specifically
held
that
scienter
was
implicit
in
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
in
going
back
to
the
wieman
versus
updegraff
case,
that
was
in
1952
that
this
court
held
at
an
oklahoma
statute
requiring
a
specified
oath
on
the
basis
of
--
was
in
that
--
on
the
basis
that
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
had
held
that
knowledge
was
not
a
factor
under
the
oklahoma
statute.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
may
it
please
the
court.
just
before
adjournment,
i
made
mention
--
excuse
me
--
of
the
case
of
wieman
versus
updegraff
decided
by
this
court
in
1952
in
which
this
court
held
invalid
an
oklahoma
statute
because
scienter
had
been
--
or
knowledge
had
been
held
by
the
oklahoma
court
not
to
be
a
factor
under
the
statute.
in
the
--
two
times
before
this
court
had
decided
the
garner
case
in
which
this
--
in
which
knowledge
was
not
referred
to
in
the
ordinance
there
under
consideration,
but
the
court
had
sustained
the
ordinance
stating
we
assume
that
scienter
is
implicit
in
each
clause
of
the
oath.
and
in
the
wieman
case,
this
court
commented
regarding
the
garner
case
of
--
that
one
of
the
attacks
made
on
the
oath
in
that
case,
that
is
the
garner
case
was
that
it
violated
due
process
because
its
negation
was
not
limited
to
organizations
known
by
the
employee
to
be
within
the
prescribed
clause
and
then
the
court
said
that
this
argument
was
objected
in
that
case
because
we
thought
justified
and
assumed
that
scienter
was
implicit,
each
clause
of
the
oath.
in
1957,
more
than
two
years
before
the
oath
was
presented
to
appellant
here
for
execution.
the
florida
supreme
court
had
before
it
the
case
of
state
versus
diez
in
which
there
was
involved
an
indictment
for
perjury
in
connection
with
the
making
of
an
oath
under
a
statute.
and
in
that
indictment,
there
it
was
not
alleged
that
the
statements
were
willfully
false
or
anything
about
the
employee
having
the
--
particular
individual
having
knowledge
of
the
subversive
nature
of
the
activities.
the
--
in
holding
the
indictment
defective
for
one
of
those
allegations,
the
court
said,
this
conclusion
that
is
that
the
indictment
was
defective
does
not
lead
us
to
a
decision
declaring
the
act
unconstitutional
because
we
think
it
is
inherent
in
the
law
that
when
one
takes
the
oath,
that
he
has
not
lent
aid,
advice,
counsel
and
the
like
to
communist
parties
represent
an
oath
he
had
not
done
it
--
with
knowingly.
and
the
court
in
the
discussion
in
the
diez
case
discussed
both
the
garner
case
and
the
wieman
case
when
one
of
the
complaints
in
the
--
complaint
by
appellant
here,
in
his
complaint,
was
that
the
florida
statute
did
not
have
the
element
of
scienter.
the
trial
judge
said
that
that
contention
was
not
well
founded
and
then
quoted
from
the
diez
case.
in
the
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
the
lend
and
aid,
support
and
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
the
lending
of
aid,
support
and
so
forth
to
the
communist
party
in
the
past.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
what
did
the
indictment
allege?
mr.
j.
r.
wells
it
merely
alleged
the
fact
that
he
had
lent
aid,
support
and
so
forth
but
there
was
no
allegation
regarding
the
fact
that
it
was
knowingly
done
or
the
willfully
done
it.
and
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
just
the
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
the
fact
of
lending
aid
and
support,
but
nothing
with
regard
to
knowledge
or
willful.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
in
general
terms,
but
i
have
the
case
here.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
don't
recall
exactly
but
i
think
it
was
in
general
terms.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
it
was
attack
on
the
indictment.
the
indictment
is
being
held
to
be
insufficient
by
the
trial
judge
and
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
from
that
decision
of
the
trial
judge.
and
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
that's
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
that's
my
assumption
because
i
don't
read
any
of
his
--
either
his
jurisdictional
statement
or
his
brief
as
raising
any
question
of
scienter.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
it
may
be
that
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
and
if
so,
i
apologize.
i
just
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
scienter
was
not
--
the
absence
of
scienter
in
the
florida
statute
was
not
effective.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
apply
it
your
honor
that
he's
--
it's
got
to
be
a
willfully
and
knowingly
false.
in
other
words,
that
he
has
not
--
that
if
he
does
not
--
unless
he
is
willfully
and
corruptly
swearing
to
it
that
there
could
be
a
prosecution
on
it.
that's
a
way
--
that's
the
way
i
apply
it
your
honor.
in
other
words,
there
has
got
to
be
knowledge
of
the
--
the
facts
that
it
is
a
false
statement
of
belief
that
it's
bona
fide
that
there
couldn't
be
a
prosecution
of
it,
but
turning
then
to
the
allegations
of
the
--
of
the
statements
that
have
to
be
in
the
oath
under
the
florida
statute.
i
understand
no
question
is
raised
with
regard
to
the
first
statement
after
the
support
in
the
constitution
and
so
forth
that
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
that
it
is
conceded
by
opposing
counsel
that
that
is
not
an
invalid
requirement
in
an
oath
of
this
kind.
so
that
brings
it
to
the
second
clause
or
the
next
clause
following
that
that
i
have
not
and
will
not
lend
my
aid,
support,
advice,
counsel
and
influence
to
the
communist
party.
now,
as
i
understand,
the
question
is
put
--
is
quite
well
eliminated
as
to
any
question
that
could
be
raised
by
somebody
else,
not
a
party
to
this
suit.
in
other
words,
as
to
whether
this
is
a
bill
of
attainder
on
ex
post
facto
law
as
to
somebody
else.
it
is
not
involved
here
where
appellant
has
alleged
that
he
has
never
lent
aid,
support,
advice,
counsel
and
influence
to
communist
party.
but
--
and
in
our
brief,
we
have
made
the
subsidiary
contention
that
even
if
that
were
before
the
court
that
that
could
be
sustained
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
is
so
clear
that
he
can't
raise
it,
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
time
on
argument
of
going
into
that.
but
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
would
your
honor
on
the
same
theory
on
which
the
hawker
case
was
decided
and
the
same
theory
on
which
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
the
hawker
--
the
--
involved
in
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
yes
sir,
involving
the
--
not
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
he
practiced
in
madison
and
he
had
committed
an
abortion
15
years
before
the
act
was
passed
and
yet
it
was
held
to
be
valid
to
prevent
him
from
practicing
medicine
and
on
the
same
theory
on
which
the
deveau
case
i
believe
it
was,
was
decided
two
or
three
years
ago
by
this
court
involving
the
union
officers
on
the
waterfront
in
which
ex-felons
were
precluded
from
being
union
officers
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
had
been
convicted
many
years
before.
now,
i
realize
that
the
(inaudible)
case
involving
an
attorney
in
either
illinois,
i
believe
illinois
or
one
--
some
state
has
to
be
taken
into
account
in
connection
with
that
where
there
was
just
the
member
of
the
communist
party
many
years
before.
but
i
do
think
that
in
view
of
the
element
of
scienter
here,
and
that
you
can
sustain
so
far
as
the
school
teacher
is
concerned
not
requiring
the
pupils
around
the
hazard
of
whether
a
reform
has
been
bona
fide
where
he
has
knowingly
aided
a
subversive
organization
in
years
gone
by.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
largely
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
don't
recall
that
definitely
but
i
don't
think
there
was.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
two
years
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
felt
that
your
honor
that
that
would
come
within
it
for
the
reason
that
i
don't
think
parallelism
of
action
would
--
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
--
be
an
aid
to
the
communist
party.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
it's
hard
to
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
you
don't
have
the
element
of
a
conviction.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
of
course
it's
--
it's
hard
to
say
what
a
--
a
man
would
be
left
out
of
(inaudible)
on
various
things
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
--
but
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
a
reasonable
(inaudible)
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
don't
believe
that
unless
there
was
a
direct
element
of
aiding
and
supporting
in
connection
with
a
--
contributing
toward
the
subversive
aims,
i
don't
believe
that
that
could
reasonably
come
within
it.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
of
course
it's
possible
your
honor
but
there
are
many
matters
that
come
up
in
connection
with
laws
and
indefiniteness
where
arguments
can
be
made
one
way
or
the
other
and
yet
the
laws
can
be
held
to
be
of
sufficient
depth.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
but
the
element
of
scienter
is
in
there
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
but
does
he
--
and
does
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
unless
he
intends
to
aid
the
communist
party
as
such.
i
don't
see
how
he
could
possibly
come
within
it.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
realize
that
a
contention
can
be
made
that
the
--
that
there's
too
much
of
an
indebtedness
in
that
your
honor
but
i
--
when
you
have
the
scienter
as
a
factor
in
it,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
sufficient
that
the
oath
should
be
declared
unconstitutional
on
the
basis
of
indebtedness.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
in
that
case
though,
the
knowledge
was
held
not
to
be
a
factor
under
the
oklahoma
statute
by
the
--
by
the
oklahoma
court.
in
other
words,
that
was
the
difference
between
that
case
and
our
situation
that
is
--
that
that
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
--
differences
in
the
statute.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
don't
believe
that
those
purposes
could
come
within
the
purport
of
the
activeness
to
justice
douglas.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
on
account
of
the
fact
that
the
subversive
character
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
that
--
that
is
construed
by
the
court
to
have
reference
to
the
subversive
character.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
it
is
on
page
13
of
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
think
it
would
depend
your
honor
on
the
motive.
in
other
words,
whether
there
was
a
motive
to
advance
the
party
knowing
of
its
subversive
character
or
whether
it
was
a
--
purpose
of
events
and
cause.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
that
same
distinction
here
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well
it
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
don't
think
he
would
unless
his
motive
was
to
advance
the
cause
of
the
party
as
distinguished
from
an
advancing
the
cause
that
the
party
was
also
seeking
to
advance.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
don't
see
how
unless
in
other
words,
unless
the
--
what
he
did
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
the
communist
party
as
distinguished
from
advancing
the
cause
there
that
the
communist
party
was
also
seeking
to
advance
at
the
time.
i
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
sufficient
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
think
you
look
to
his
motives
but
i
think
you'd
have
to
have
more
than
that
to
establish
his
motives.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
can
understand
the
point
that
your
honor
is
putting
and
raising
and
realize
that
it's
a
point
that
has
to
be
faced
in
the
case,
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
should
be
fatal
to
the
--
to
the
statute.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
of
course,
i
realize
your
honor
that
the
alternatives
are
to
be
taken
into
account
to
a
brief
but
i
think
also
that
the
legislature
is
not
bound
to
consider
the
best
possible
alternative.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
and
that
if
this
has
a
reasonable
connection
with
a
purpose
which
they
have
a
right
to
achieve
that
it
is
something
that
they
could
have
adopted.
now,
what
is
the
purpose
that
they
have
a
right
to
achieve
so
far
as
school
teachers
are
concerned?
it
is
that
in
this
sensitive
area
that
persons
not
be
teaching
school
where
there
is
an
undue
hazard
that
they
may
be
disloyal
to
the
united
states
government.
now,
this
court
held
in
the
garner
case,
i
think
with
seven
out
of
eight
of
the
participating
justices
agreeing
that
the
provision
of
the
affidavit
plan
to
the
effect
that
they
were
required
to
state
whether
they
had
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
and
if
so,
when?
now,
that
went
back
to
the
indefinite
past
and
yet
that
was
sustained
by
--
by
this
court,
by
an
overwhelming
vote
of
the
justices.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
it
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
they
are
words
of
breadth
but
i
think
the
words
like
counsel
and
advice
that
they
have
had
a
long
history
of
having
been
used
in
connection
with
accessories,
words
of
that
kind,
accessory
before
it,
in
fact
on
crime
and
things
of
that
kind
and
i
think
all
that
needs
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
in
the
meaning
to
be
attached
to
it
as
to
whether
the
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
influence
is
sometimes
used
in
connection
as
influence
in
an
act
in
connection
with
accessory
before
the
fact
but
advice
and
counsel
are
more.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
believe
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
don't
know
that
the
question
can
be
answered
strictly
that
we
--
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
take
it
for
instance
as
applied
specifically
to
the
past,
i
think
it's
quite
definite
that
the
--
a
party
cannot
raise
a
question
for
someone
else
on
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
if
they
are
--
to
a
loyal
american,
if
his
rights
--
if
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
invaded
then
there
certainly
is
redress.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
that's
as
to
whether
if
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
invaded.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
but
the
--
i
think
the
--
it
does
affect
whether
his
constitutional
rights
has
been
invaded.
what
his
position
is
and
what
--
how
he
stands
with
relation
to
the
oath
as
to
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
--
whether
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
invaded.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
that
would
depend
on
whether
there
is
an
invasion
of
his
constitutional
rights.
there's
an
invasion
of
his
constitutional
rights
then
he
can't
be
required
to
take
it.
i
think
if
it
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
a
communist
or
a
person
who
has
lent
aid
or
support
to
the
communist
party
years
ago
and
has
reformed
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
raise
a
question
as
to
whether
that
was
a
bill
of
attainder
or
ex
post
facto
law
as
to
whether
how
that
--
it
would
be
answered,
it
would
be
a
different
question
but
he
would
be
entitled
to
raise
that
question
as
to
whether
there
was
passed
to
him
a
bill
of
attainder
or
ex
post
facto
law.
but
i
don't
think
that
a
person
who
says
that
he
has
never
lent
aid,
support
and
so
forth
to
the
communist
party
can
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
it's
an
ex
post
facto
law
or
bill
of
attainder
because
it
couldn't
possibly
be
as
to
him.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
oh,
i
think
he
would
--
he
would
have
the
right
to
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
his
constitutional
rights
had
been
invaded
by
the
unconstitutionally
vague
statute
as
--
but
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
think
he
could
raise
it
in
advance
although
i
do
think
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
think
--
i
think
he
could
raise
it
in
a
type
of
procedures
that
is
raised
–
that's
invoked
here.
but
if
i
say
i
think
he
could
raise
it
in
a
type
of
procedure
that
was
invoked
to
him,
declaratory
decree
if
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
invaded.
but
i
question
that
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
invaded
and
also,
i
think
that
if
a
person
is
not
in
a
very
good
position
to
say
that
i
could
not
sign
that
oath
as
to
whether
to
the
effect
that
i've
never
lent
aid
and
support
because
of
doubt
as
to
what
might
be
considered
aid-support
and
yet
at
the
same
time
square
that
i
have
never
lent
aid
or
support.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
that
gets
to
the
question
as
to
whether
it
is
fatally
indefinite
and
with
the
scienter
in
there,
i
don't
think
it
is
fatally
in
depth
because
you've
got
to
show
a
lack
of
bona
fides
in
connection
with
it
and
i
don't
think
that
there
--
in
order
to
show
that
it
was
false
and
i
don't
think
that
that
could
ever
be
shown.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
don't
--
i
think
that
the
statement
by
the
court
in
this
decision
substantially
holds
that
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
in
the
statements.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
at
the
bottom
of
page
13
of
the
record.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
yes.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
not
exactly
your
honor.
it
is
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
it
is
my
position
that
where
he
shows
that
he
has
not
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
more
questionable
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
think
it's
necessary
that
he
show
that
he
come
within
the
class
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
however
--
but
--
certainly
if
he
(voice

--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
--
he
doesn't
come
within
the
class
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
doubt
that
he
would
but
of
this
situation
that
he
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
think
it
depends
on
which
standing
the
question
what
it
would
be
brought.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
think
he
has
standing
in
the
question
of
the
act
on
certain
basis
of
it
without
regard
to
that,
but
i
don't
think
he's
got
standing
to
contend
that
it
is
an
ex
post
facto
law
or
bill
of
attainder.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
on
account
of
the
fact
that
it
cannot
be
an
ex
post
facto
or
bill
of
attainder
unless
it
adversely
affects
him.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
think
that
it's
affected
seriously
where
he
--
on
the
--
in
the
question
of
vagueness.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
doubt
that
he
has
the
right
to
raise
the
question
of
vagueness
where
he
comes
in
and
swears
to
the
facts
that
he
says,
the
oath
is
too
vague
with
regard
to.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
no
sir,
no
sir.
i
don't
think
that's
been
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
don't
think
he
does,
generally
speaking,
no.
but
if
he
shows
that
he
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
no
sir.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
our
position
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
that
was
the
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
--
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
think
he
has
to
in
large
measure
your
honor
where
he
says,
“i
have
not
lent
aid,
support
and
so
forth
to
the
communist
party.
i'm
not
a
communist.
i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
united
states
and
the
state
of
florida
by
force
or
violence
and
i'm
not
a
member
of
an
organization
or
parties
that
believes
in
or
teaches
the
overthrow
and
--”
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
to
--
i
think
in
large
measure
your
honor
that
is
right.
and
i
think
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
of
course
that
gets
to
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
that
gets
to
the
question
of
whether
it
is
fatally
indefinite
and
if
the
statute
is
fatally
indefinite
then
i
don't
question
that
the
statute
is
invalid
but
that
gets
back
to
the
question
as
to
whether
it
is
fatally
indefinite.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
realize
that
there
is
that
possibility
your
honor.
well,
the
next
clause
of
the
oath
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
believe
it
is
your
honor.
i
believe
it's
relevant.
you
mean
as
to
whether
he
can
make
the
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
don't
know.
i'm
sorry
that
i'm
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
think
that
that
is
--
is
what
enforced.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
would
have
thought
it
was
at
least
to
the
clause
and
relief
question
your
honor.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
--
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
think
the
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
think
the
florida
rule
on
that
is
that
has
been
referred
to
as
a
state
rule
is
similar
to
a
rule
that
this
court
has
announced
as
to
the
necessity
of
a
person
injured
in
--
a
necessity
of
a
person
being
injured
in
order
to
get
a
decision
on
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
if
--
if
that
is
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
you
mean
as
to
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
it's
entirely
possible
that
there
might
be
the
right.
i
haven't
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
think
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
your
honor
that
if
the
--
if
the
florida
court
has
announced
a
rule
which
is
a
sufficient
rule
of
state
law
to
decide
this
case
then
as
to
whether
there's
any
other
redress
i
think
would
be
a
question
for
another
case.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i'm
saying
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
feel
like
your
honor
that
the
florida
rule
is
sufficient
to
deny
him
relief.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
in
florida.
now,
i'm
under
the
general
impression
that
the
federal
rule
is
not
too
much
different
from
the
florida
rule
in
that
regard
but
i'm
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i'm
not
familiar
with
those
two
decisions
that
the
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
remember
something
out
of
the
case
now
your
honor.
i
didn't
recall
it
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
r.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
wells
oh,
did
your
honor
read
from
the
bottom
of
page
18
and
top
of
page
19?
mr.
j.
r.
wells
i
didn't
--
mr.
j.
r.
wells
well,
i
see
that
my
time
is
nearly
up
and
i'll
just
briefly
refer
to
the
clause
of
the
oath.
i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
united
states
and
the
state
of
florida
by
force
or
violence.
i
would
like
to
call
your
particular
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
language
there
does
not
contain
the
words
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
felt
to
be
particularly
obnoxious
in
the
douds
case
with
regard
to
where
--
by
unconstitutional
or
illegal
means
that
they
are
not
in
the
florida
statute
and
that
this
is
limited
to
the
violent
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
which
i
think
would
go
far
to
eliminate
the
objections
that
was
dealt
in
part
in
the
douds
case.
now,
i
think
the
--
on
that
clause,
the
validity
of
the
oath
might
well
depend
on
what
is
to
be
meant,
considered
to
be
meant
by
that
expression.
in
other
words,
does
that
refer
to
a
belief
in
the
abstract
doctrine
of
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
or
violence
or
does
that
have
reference
to
the
overthrow
as
an
objective
of
the
government
as
presently
constituted
by
force
and
violence.
and
i
think
that
it
definitely
has
reference
to
the
overthrow
as
an
objective
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
--
as
presently
constituted
and
does
not
refer
to
any
plea
within
the
--
for
some
conceivable
set
of
circumstances
not
now
existing
or
some
dictatorship
or
something
of
that
kind.
thank
you
your
honors.
