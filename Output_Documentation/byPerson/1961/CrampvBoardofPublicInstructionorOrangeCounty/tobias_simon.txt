mr.
tobias
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
final
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
upholding
the
validity
of
fla.
stat.
876.05
against
the
contention
that
this
statute
violated
the
provisions
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution.
this
is
the
act
which
requires
that
all
public
employees
in
the
state
of
florida,
including
david
walton
cramp,
who
is
a
teacher,
execute
a
loyalty
or
expurgatory
oath
as
a
condition
of
his
employment.
the
pertinent
provisions
of
that
oath
other
than
the
ones
that
were
in
effect
prior
to
1949
which
at
that
time
simply
required
all
public
employees
to
swear
loyalty
to
the
constitution
and
to
the
--
and
to
the
united
states,
now
require
that
the
public
employee
swear
that
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
i
quote,
“that
i
have
not
and
will
not
lend
my
aid,
support,
advice,
counsel
or
influence
to
the
communist
party;
that
i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
state
of
florida
by
force
or
violence;
and
fourth,
that
i
am
not
a
member
of
any
organization
or
party
which
believes
in
or
teaches
directly
or
indirectly
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
or
violence.”
now,
the
appellant,
cramp,
had
been
employed
in
orange
county
as
a
teacher
for
nine
years
when
just
prior
to
the
institution
of
this
litigation,
it
was
realized
that
through
some
administrative
oversight,
he
had
not
executed
the
loyalty
oath.
he
was
approached
and
requested
to
sign
the
oath.
mr.
tobias
simon
since
1949
sir.
mr.
tobias
simon
yes,
that
is
correct.
cramp
refused
to
sign
the
oath
on
the
grounds
that
the
state
could
not
validly
and
constitutionally
require
that
he
execute
this
oath
as
a
condition
of
his
employment
and
for
no
other
reason.
he
brought
an
action
in
orange
county
under
florida
statutes
for
declaratory
relief
to
declare
the
statute
invalid
and
to
assert
his
continuing
right
to
teach
school
without
the
necessity
of
executing
this
oath.
this
relief
was
denied
to
him
by
the
circuit
court
and
this
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
this
appeal
then
followed.
i
would
like
to
state
that
the
issue
before
this
court
as
i
understand
it
is
not
whether
or
not
florida
is
to
be
required
to
keep
communists
in
its
roles
of
public
employees
nor
is
the
question
so
ably
put
by
my
brother
that
florida
cannot
establish
reasonable
qualifications
for
its
teaching
personnel
or
other
employees.
because
however,
there
is
always
and
this
court
has
always
recognized
the
duty
of
a
state
with
regard
to
its
public
employees
to
establish
only
and
stipulate
only
those
qualifications
which
are
reasonable
and
which
are
reasonably
designed
to
fit
the
man
to
the
job.
because
of
that
requirement,
we
state
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
qualifications
imposed
by
florida
are
reasonable
and
whether
they
bear
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
position
itself.
irrespective,
i
wish
to
point
out
at
this
point
in
the
argument
whether
these
qualifications
were
imposed
through
the
procedural
device
or
vehicle
of
the
loyalty
oath
or
whether
they
were
imposed
by
statute.
i
think
there
is
no
issue
about
the
fact
that
a
state
cannot
impose
qualifications
for
employment
which
violate
due
process,
equal
protection
and
this
court
has
unanimously
stated
on
many
occasions.
cons
--
mr.
tobias
simon
i
will
emphasize
--
mr.
tobias
simon
i
will
emphasize
three
particular
clauses
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
tobias
simon
it
is
conceivable
and
i
do
not
wish
to
reach
the
point
necessarily
that
the
first
of
the
clauses
that
one
must
not
be
a
communist
in
order
to
teach
in
the
public
schools.
it
is
conceivable
that
under
present
decisions
of
this
court,
florida
could
stipulate
a
qualification
that
no
communist
could
be
a
teacher
in
the
florida
schools.
mr.
tobias
simon
that
of
course
is
--
that
is
the
same
oath
that
i
am
required
to
take
and
i
believe
that
the
justices
of
this
court
are
required
to
take
it
--
mr.
tobias
simon
--
there's
no
quarrel
about
that.
mr.
tobias
simon
we
do
not
at
this
point
contend
that
this
particular
qualification
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
tobias
simon
on
at
least
three
grounds,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
tobias
simon
we
challenge
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
tobias
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
tobias
simon
we
likewise
challenge
that
on
additional
grounds
to
all
the
others.
mr.
tobias
simon
if
i
--
mr.
tobias
simon
if
i
may
direct
my
attention
to
the
first
of
the
clauses
which
your
honor
has
indicated
we
oppose,
and
that
is
the
question
of
that
clause
of
the
oath
which
states
that
i
have
not
lent
aid,
support,
advice,
counsel
or
influence
to
the
communist
party?
now,
the
state
of
florida
has
specifically
interpreted
this
clause
to
me
that
i
do
not
presently
lend
aid,
support,
influence,
counsel
or
advice
to
the
communist
party,
but
that
i
have
never
at
any
time
in
the
unending
test,
done
such
an
act.
now
we
maintain
and
contend,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
this
is
included
in
a
loyalty
oath
that
this
particular
qualification
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
to
require
of
an
employee
that
he
executes
and
makes
such
a
statement
as
a
condition
of
employment.
in
the
first
place,
it
can
hardly
be
alluded
to
as
a
qualification
of
a
teacher.
we
do
not
say
that
a
state
may
not
ask
to
secure
this
information
but
florida
has
said
blanketly
that
no
person
who
has
ever
lent
aid,
support,
counsel
or
advice
to
the
communist
party
is
suited
to
be
a
teacher
or
other
public
employee.
it
is
immaterial
whether
30,
40,
50
years
ago,
an
individual
may
have
joined
the
communist
party
or
lent
aid,
support,
counsel
or
advice
whatever
those
words
mean
to
the
communist
party
for
one
day
and
since
that
time,
devoted
himself
to
a
program
of
rabid
anti-communism,
if
you
will,
spent
that
time
acquiring
enumerable
college
degrees
and
presented
himself
on
the
doorsteps
of
our
capital
building
in
tallahassee
only
to
be
told
there
that
the
law
of
this
state
disqualifies
you
from
being
either
a
public
employee
or
a
teacher.
mr.
tobias
simon
not
to
my
knowledge
if
your
honor
please.
the
progressive
party
was
there
and
that,
in
some
minds,
is
exactly
the
same
thing
in
florida.
mr.
tobias
simon
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
what
the
state
of
florida
said
was
that
we
had
no
standing
to
raise
this
as
a
matter
of
ex
post
facto.
they
said
that
this
law
was
not
an
ex
post
facto
law
with
regard
to
this
particular
appellant
and
they
may
be
right.
however,
what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
this
particular
qualification
cannot
be
imposed
as
a
matter
of
due
process
and
he
certainly
has
not
waived
his
rights
by
merely
stating
that
he
has
never
done
this
under
the
due
process
clause
to
assume
this
would
mean
to
say
for
example
that
torcaso
had
to
be
an
atheist
in
order
to
obtain
relief
from
this
court.
mr.
tobias
simon
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
this
particular
question
insofar
as
there
is
any
merit
to
it
and
we
do
not
concede
that
there
is
merit
to
the
statement,
but
that
any
standing
to
sue
is
--
we
do
have
standing
to
sue
because
this
is
a
matter
of
due
process
that
a
man
who
states
that
he
is
not
a
communist
and
has
never
lent
aid,
support
or
counsel
or
advice
to
the
communist
party
is
nevertheless
entitled
as
an
american
under
the
due
process
clause
to
refuse
to
execute
an
oath
which
requires
that
he
so
state
this.
a
man
for
example,
this
court
has
stated
that
a
state
cannot
pass
a
law
that
no
public
employee
may
go
to
mass
or
no
person
who
attends
mass
can
be
a
public
employee.
now,
i
may
not
ever
have
attended
a
mass
and
yet
i
believe
that
this
law
is
invalid
and
that
i
have
a
right
not
to
execute
such
a
note
and
that
disqualification
cannot
be
imposed
by
the
state
irrespective
of
my
religion.
the
fact
that
a
law
is
bad,
the
fact
that
a
qualification
for
employment
violates
due
process,
does
not
depend
on
whether
the
individual
who
is
involved
in
the
procedure,
so
long
as
he
is
in
the
class
which
is
being
effective,
a
non-public
employee
could
not
come
to
this
court
and
complain,
but
this
man
is
a
public
employee.
mr.
tobias
simon
that
is
correct.
mr.
tobias
simon
yes
sir.
and
i
also
state
that
if
there
is
any
merit
to
it
whatsoever,
it
is
restricted
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
cramp
can
claim
that
he
is
within
the
class
that
can
raise
the
issue
that
this
is
an
ex
post
facto
law,
but
we
rest
primarily
on
the
proposition
that
the
asserted
state
ground
is
not
a
proper
one.
mr.
tobias
simon
the
--
mr.
tobias
simon
no
your
honor.
we
submit
that
he
is
within
the
class
that
is
being
affected.
he
is
within
the
class
of
public
employees
who
are
asked
to
comply
with
a
particular
qualification.
now,
the
reason
why
--
mr.
tobias
simon
well,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
mere
statement,
the
mere
fact
that
he
has
come
to
this
court
as
others
have
not
done
and
have
stated
what
his
political
beliefs
are
does
not
remove
him
from
the
protection
of
the
due
process
clause,
now
this
court,
i
do
not
believe
will
take
the
position
that
there
must
be
a
doubt
in
the
minds
of
justices
before
they
will
give
benefit
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
litigants.
suppose
torcaso
--m
mr.
tobias
simon
--
had
come
--
mr.
tobias
simon
well,
we
submit
that
we
are
hurt
because
this
is
a
man
who
should
not
be
required
to
submit
to
a
qualification
which
offends
the
constitution
regardless
of
whether
he
himself
is
a
person
who
is
being
hurt
directly.
we
submit
that
there
is
an
indirect
hurt
to
him
because
he
is
a
public
employee.
i
refer
again
to
the
example
of
torcaso.
if
torcaso
had
come
to
this
court
and
stated
that
he
was
not
an
atheist,
i
suspect
that
the
decision
of
this
court
must
necessarily
have
been
exactly
the
same
because
maryland
cannot
impose
a
religious
test
upon
public
employees
whether
atheist
raised
the
question
or
non-atheist
raised
the
question
and
i
suspect
that
the
due
process
clause
under
which
we
are
claiming
here
is
as
much
available
to
non-communist
as
it
is
to
those
who
have
a
lent
aid,
influence
or
support
to
the
communist
party
or
to
those,
i
think
this
is
basically
the
question
who
do
not
come
and
tell
this
court
as
torcaso
did
not
come,
as
garner
did
not
come,
as
the
attorney
in
the
konigsberg
in
the
following
case
and
test
flow
did
not
come
and
so
this
court.
mr.
tobias
simon
except
that
in
this
case,
if
your
honor
please,
this
man
did
not
sign
this
affidavit
and
the
statements
that
he
made
in
his
complaint
were
not
regarded
by
the
state
of
florida
as
a
substitute
for
this
affidavit.
and
unless
he
--
and
until
he
signs
this
affidavit,
he
is
not
in
a
position
to
draw
on
public
funds
and
i
would
like
to
add
the
following.
the
statements
that
he
made
in
his
complaint
do
not
foreclose
the
issue
because
the
language
that
is
used
in
this
particular
clause
of
the
oath
that
he
has
not
lent
aid,
support,
influence,
counsel
or
advice
to
the
communist
party
are
so
vague,
broad,
general
as
to
be
actually
incapable
of
analysis
or
interpretation
except
as
in
a
--
except
in
a
completely
subjective
manner
and
the
fact
that
he
stated
that
in
his
opinion
he
did
not
do
these
things
is
not
a
guarantee
because
of
the
looseness.
mr.
tobias
simon
that
some
court
will
find
--
mr.
tobias
simon
that
some
court
would
find
that
he
has
done
exactly
the
same
thing
--
mr.
tobias
simon
--
or
has
not
done
exactly
the
same
thing.
mr.
tobias
simon
but
this
another
ground
why
this
particular
language,
the
vagueness
and
your
honor
of
course
has
dissented
in
both
garner
and
in
the
american
communications
association
--
mr.
tobias
simon
--
on
the
same
ground.
mr.
tobias
simon
i
had
not
at
that
point
come
to
that
argument
your
honor.
mr.
tobias
simon
that
is
because
the
language
of
this
particular
section
is
incapable
of
actual
definition
and
therefore
as
a
matter
of
due
process
should
not
be
included
among
the
qualifications
for
teachers
or
public
employees
in
florida
or
in
any
other
state.
the
next
clause
of
the
oath
is
the
clause
which
states
that
i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
also
that
i
am
not
a
member
of
any
organization
which
believes
in,
and
this
of
course
i
think
is
impossible
and
so
the
persons
who
were
at
the
statute
added
the
words
“word
teachers,
directly
or
indirectly
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
or
violence.”
to
my
knowledge,
there
has
been
but
one
other
case
in
which
the
question
of
belief
in
terms
of
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
has
come
before
this
court
and
that
was
some
10
or
11
years
ago
in
american
communications
association
versus
douds.
at
that
time,
the
court
by
a
three-to-three
decision
affirmed
the
judgment
below.
nevertheless,
justice
vincent,
mr.
justice
vincent
in
writing
for
the
majority
put
a
gloss
on
the
word
belief
and
stated
that
the
only
thing
that
this
can
constitutionally
mean
is
a
belief
in
the
objectives
of
violent
overthrow
as
an
immediate
objective
rather
than
as
a
prophecy.
and
this
concept
has
come
down
to
us
since
that
time.
in
speiser
--
speiser
versus
randall,
although
that
dealt
with
the
question
of
advocacy,
this
court
insisted
upon
and
secured
from
the
attorney
general
of
california
the
statement
that
the
advocacy
therein
involved
was
advocacy
not
as
an
immediate
objective
--
not
as
a
prophecy
but
as
an
immediate
objective.
and
if
it
is
true
for
advocacy,
of
course,
it
must
necessarily
be
true
for
inner
beliefs
which
this
court
douds
and
all
time
subsequently
stated
are
in
violence.
this
position
was
urged
before
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
was
ignored,
but
we
go
on
to
state
that
regardless
in
our
opinion
and
we
so
contend
to
this
court
that
regardless
of
any
gloss,
any
shaving
that
can
be
made
of
this
word
believe
that
the
concepts
of
belief
and
a
man's
beliefs
are
not
the
function
or
the
power
of
government
to
inquire
into.
neither
this
court
nor
any
arm
of
federal
government,
nor
the
state
government
of
florida,
can
call
into
play
and
demand
to
know
what
are
a
man's
beliefs
as
a
condition
of
his
employment.
and
we
submit
that
any
requirement
as
a
qualification
for
public
employment
that
a
man
divulge
his
beliefs
must
be
unconstitutional
and
invalid
under
the
provisions
of
the
first
amendment.
the
old
story
of
dionysus
who
had
a
man
killed
for
dreaming,
that
he
killed
somebody
would
i
think
follow
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
this
court
should
strike
down
any
qualification
for
employment
that
requires
an
individual
and
especially
a
teacher
fit
within
a
stereotype
concept
of
belief.
and
again
--
mr.
tobias
simon
no
sir.
i
do
not
believe
and
we
--
and
it's
our
position
that
a
man's
beliefs
are
in
violence.
the
state
cannot
call
forth
any
statement
from
him
as
to
his
beliefs
as
a
condition
of
employment.
i
think
that
persons,
i
think
that
christian
science
practitioners
are
perfectly
capable
of
teaching
medicine
in
a
medical
school.
i
think
that
persons
who
are
biblical
fundamentalist
are
perfectly
capable
of
teaching
--
mr.
tobias
simon
--
evolution
in
a
college.
i
think
that
a
catholic
president
for
example
is
perfectly
capable
of
expressing
the
viewpoint
that
there
should
not
be
public
aid
to
education
or
can
support
a
program
of
birth
control
in
and
throughout
the
nation.
in
other
words,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
necessary
corollary
that
what
a
man
believes
will
obviate
or
will
excuse
him
from
the
sworn
duty
to
follow
a
prescribe
curriculum
whether
he'd
be
president
or
whether
he'd
be
a
janitor
or
a
public
school
teacher.
mr.
tobias
simon
yes
sir,
i
--
i
--
mr.
tobias
simon
yes
sir.
and
i
believe
that
your
honor
said
something
to
the
same
effect
--
mr.
tobias
simon
--
in
garner
[attempt
to
laughter]
where
you
stated
that
man
cannot
be
asked
to
swear
about
something
they
cannot
be
expected
to
know,
such
a
demand
is
at
war
with
individual
integrity.
it
can
be
no
more
justified
than
the
inquiry
into
belief
which
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
jackson
and
i,
deemed
invalid
in
american
communications
association
versus
douds.
mr.
tobias
simon
no
sir.
the
qualification
of
knowledge
is
an
entirely
different
proposition
from
the
qualification
of
the
--
mr.
tobias
simon
i
do
not
--
mr.
tobias
simon
well,
we
state
that
in
this
particular
instance,
a
man's
beliefs
as
to
violent
overthrow,
do
not
serve
as
a
basis
for
excluding
him
from
the
faculty
in
a
public
school
system
in
florida
for
two
reasons
which
we
have
stated;
one,
because
the
concepts
of
belief
are
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
to
inquire
into,
and
secondly,
and
certainly,
and
this
court
has
held
on
this
point
that
the
only
type
of
belief
in
this
area
which
can
serve
as
some
basis
for
inquiry
is
a
type
of
belief
or
advocacy
into
the
overthrow
of
the
government
as
an
immediate
objective
rather
than
as
a
question
of
prophecy.
mr.
tobias
simon
because,
i
believe
that
this
court
has
already
foreclosed
that
question.
i
think
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
prohibit
from
its
employ
and
i
believe
your
honor
did
so
state
that
a
state
can
prohibit
from
its
employ,
your
honor
stated
this
in
your
dissent
in
garner,
any
person
who
seeks
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence
or
is
--
or
are
knowingly
members
of
organizations
engaged
in
such
endeavor.
mr.
tobias
simon
not
the
force
and
violence
part.
i
challenge
the
--
mr.
tobias
simon
--
ability
of
the
state
of
florida
to
require
that
a
man
express
his
beliefs
as
distinguished
from
his
actions
in
membership,
as
distinguished
possibly
from
his
advocacy,
written
statements
or
oral
statements
but
i
maintain
that
it
has
always
been
the
concept
of
our
constitution
and
of
this
court
that
individual
integrity
requires
that
an
individual's
unspoken,
unadvocated,
unwritten
beliefs
are
his
and
belong
to
him
privately
and
solely.
mr.
tobias
simon
yes
sir
because
it
states
the
word
‘believe.'
now,
to
state
that
i
do
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
is
an
entirely
different
matter
provided
of
course,
and
i
make
the
same
proviso
on
the
belief
clause,
provided
that
by
advocate
both
legislature
and
the
courts
of
florida
mean
as
an
immediate
objective
as
distinguished
from
a
prophecy.
mr.
tobias
simon
i
would
say
--
mr.
tobias
simon
--
that
the
minute
--
no
sir,
because
as
soon
as
this
is
stated,
it
now
becomes
a
matter
of
record,
it
is
a
matter
then
of
advocacy.
and
on
this
proposition,
i
think
this
court
has
ruled
that
you
cannot
discharge
an
individual
or
refuse
to
hire
an
individual
where
advocacy
of
an
idea,
as
a
matter
of
long-term
prophecy
as
distinguished
from
an
immediate
objective
is
the
criteria.
mr.
tobias
simon
that
i
believe
also
can
be
an
entirely
different
matter.
the
state
has
the
right
to
inquire
of
him
as
to
what
his
beliefs
are
as
a
means
of
measuring
his
competency
and
his
ability
to
act
as
a
teacher
but
to
blanketly
state
that
no
person
who
does
not
sign
this
oath
can
be
a
teacher,
i
maintain
and
here
we
come
of
course
to
the
distinction
--
mr.
tobias
simon
no
sir.
mr.
tobias
simon
neither
--
neither
a
teacher
--
no
teacher
and
no
public
employee
can
be
subjected
to
a
state
qualification
or
employment
wherein
belief
is
the
sole
criterion
upon
which
he
is
to
be
hired.
mr.
tobias
simon
no
sir.
mr.
tobias
simon
that
is
correct.
that
is
wrong.
mr.
tobias
simon
it
is,
in
my
opinion,
never
alright
for
the
state
to
inquire
into
the
man's
beliefs
as
a
condition
of
his
employment.
mr.
tobias
simon
no
sir.
mr.
tobias
simon
because
this
involves
the
man's
beliefs.
mr.
tobias
simon
and
these
beliefs
cannot
be
for
--
cannot
form
the
basis
of
an
exclusion
from
public
employment.
now,
i
have
stated
that
these
qualifications,
the
retrospective
qualifications,
the
matter
of
belief
and
advocacy
which
are
contained
in
the
florida
oath
are
bad.
i
maintain
that
these
qualifications
are
invalid
and
are
unconstitutional
because
they
violate
due
process,
there
is
no
place
for
penitence
or
return,
they
violate
the
guarantees
of
the
first
amendment
which
keep
i
believe
a
man's
beliefs
and
right
to
advocate
in
violence
and
if
these
qualifications
had
been
enacted
by
statute,
those
qualifications
would
not
have
been
proper.
we
further
maintain
that
because
these
qualifications
are
embodied
in
a
loyalty
oath
which
is
presented
to
some
40,000
public
school
teachers
and
many
more
times
that
number
of
public
employees
within
the
state
of
florida,
that
the
requirement
of
the
loyalty
oath
itself
as
a
procedural
device
is
invalid.
now,
the
reason
why
we
maintain
that
position
is
because
the
requirement
that
a
man
execute
and
oath
as
distinguished
from
complying
with
certain
qualifications,
imposes
upon
him
the
necessity
of
submitting
his
associations,
his
beliefs,
his
concepts
to
the
state
in
order
for
him
to
secure
a
position.
unquestionably,
the
execution
of
a
loyalty
oath
is
a
restriction
upon
the
privileges
and
rights
of
association,
thought
and
belief
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
if
we
are
to
say
that
the
interest
of
a
state
in
prescribing
qualifications
are
so
important
as
to
outweigh
the
interests
of
the
individual
then
it
might
be
contended
that
the
means
of
achieving
these
qualifications,
the
means
of
establishing
these
qualifications
in
gaining
this
information,
can
be
utilized
through
the
means
of
the
loyalty
oath.
but
this,
i
believe,
runs
afoul
of
the
concept
that
was
established
or
utilized
in
shelton
versus
tucker
where
this
court
stated
that
where
there
are
alternative
means
of
acquiring
information,
where
there
are
alternative
means
of
achieving
an
end
desired
by
the
state,
a
second
balance
must
be
struck
if
one
method
utilizes
less
danger
and
less
harm
or
establishes
less
harm
for
the
individual's
rights
then
that
is
the
method
which
must
be
chosen.
now,
we
submit
that
to
--
that
to
turnover
to
the
entire
body
of
public
employees
in
the
state
of
florida,
an
oath
requiring
that
they
give
their
associational
ties
and
an
expression
of
their
beliefs
and
concepts
even
if
for
example,
this
court
were
to
say
that
they
could
have
this
information
in
the
first
place,
that
this
is
not
the
proper
method
of
achieving
this,
that
this
has
a
chilling
effect
upon
their
rights,
upon
their
associational
rights
as
guaranteed
under
the
first
amendment
and
this
court
i
believe
has
prescribed
and
has
shown
the
method
that
can
be
utilized
to
prescribe
these
qualifications
and
that
is
the
matter
of
the
employer-employee
investigation.
and
this
court
has
on
several
occasions,
in
beilan,
lerner
versus
casey,
konigsberg,
anastaplo,
nelson
and
globe
cases
has
stated
that
an
employee,
if
challenged
or
questioned
must
come
forward
and
give
full
and
frank
answers.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
the
method
that
florida
must
utilize
because
if
a
teacher
--
if
there
is
a
question
about
a
teacher
or
a
public
employee,
then
it
is
well
within
the
province
of
the
state
to
rid
itself
of
communists
or
other
incompetent
personnel
to
call
the
individual
in.
some
due
process
at
least
must
be
observed,
some
type
of
hearing
must
be
given;
something
is
afforded
this
individual.
the
interests
of
the
individual
can
be
protected.
the
demands
upon
the
state
are
small
and
this
method
can
be
utilized
far
better
than
the
blanket
loyalty
oath
because
it
is
our
position
that
if
we
give
at
this
time,
blanket
support
for
the
concept
of
a
loyalty
oath,
then
through
this
device,
each
and
every
employee
can
be
required
to
submit
to
doctrines
in
which
the
school
boards
or
the
government
officials
feel
are
important.
we
can
be
required
to
submit
in
signing
oaths
involving
beliefs
or
disbeliefs
or
membership
or
nonmembership
in
organizations
which
are
not
the
communist
party,
organizations
which
are
unpopular
in
florida
or
elsewhere.
mr.
tobias
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
tobias
simon
yes
sir.
requiring
a
man's
actions
are
of
course
--
would
--
the
state
can
require
a
man
to
act,
an
employee
to
act
in
a
way
in
which
he
desires,
but
a
state
cannot
require
that
a
man
believe
a
--
in
a
particular
thing.
we
also
have
laws
in
our
--
in
florida,
require
--
prohibiting
certain
types
of
discrimination
based
on
color,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
has
got
the
power
to
make
this
individual
swear
that
he
believes
that
discrimination
is
bad.
i
think
his
beliefs
are
his
own
and
so
long
as
he
is
doing
a
proper
job
then
this
is
all
that
can
be
constitutionally
required
of
him.
mr.
tobias
simon
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
have
not
mentioned
--
mr.
tobias
simon
i
have
not
mentioned
a
man's
--
mr.
tobias
simon
no
sir.
i
think
when
a
man
promises
or
undertakes
to
do
a
job
than
he
is
required
to
do
it.
but
i
feel
that
--
mr.
tobias
simon
i
feel
that
--
mr.
tobias
simon
--
that
the
danger
to
this
country
and
to
our
institutions
of
having
government
inquire
into
a
man's
beliefs
and
stipulating
that
a
man
must
believe
in
a
particular
manner
as
a
condition
of
employment
can
lead
to
far
greater
danger
than
the
possibility
that
a
man
might
not
do
a
job
even
though
he
has
sworn
to
do
it
because
he
doesn't
feel
within
himself
that
this
is
the
way
he
would
like
the
system
to
be.
we
might
all
feel
very
well
that
a
man
who
is
going
to
be
a
notary
public
should
believe
in
god
because
he
must
administer
an
oath,
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
state
has
got
the
power
to
require
that
he
believe
in
god
as
a
condition
of
this.
mr.
tobias
simon
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
not
desirable
to
achieve
this.
what
i
--
what
i
do
state,
however,
is
that
the
state,
so
long
as
there
is
no
expression
of
a
man's
beliefs
and
as
long
as
there
is
no
reduction
of
his
duties
on
the
particular
job
that
he
has
to
perform,
that
the
question
of
belief
is
not
within
the
realm
of
government
to
inquire
into
or
to
prohibit.
mr.
tobias
simon
that
is
precisely
the
line
we
are
drawing,
yes
sir.
we
might
state
also
that
going
back
in
this
picket
of
the
belief
in
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
that
one
can,
i
believe,
without
being
a
disloyal
american
believe
that
if
circumstances
and
conditions
obtained
that
existed
were
so
bad
that
the
only
resort
to
correction
was
violent
overthrow
then
this
does
not
necessarily
make
him
a
bad
american.
it
does
not
necessarily
make
him
unfit
today
when
he
states
that
conditions
are
good
and
are
favorable
and
that
conditions
can
be
rectified
in
a
proper
and
constitutional
manner.
this
does
not
make
him
a
person
who
is
incapable
of
holding
public
office
or
public
employment.
mr.
tobias
simon
absolutely
and
i'm
also
taking
up
the
statements
that
were
made
in
the
anastaplo
to
exactly
the
same
effect
where
this
young
man
as
an
attorney
for
example,
stated
that
he
would
not
subscribe
to
the
proposition
that
he
did
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
under
certain
circumstances
that
might
exist
at
some
long
time
in
the
future,
but
it
was
quite
clear
that
he
believed
that
these
circumstances
were
not
present
within
our
society
or
our
civilization
at
the
present
time.
mr.
tobias
simon
yes
your
honor.
mr.
tobias
simon
i
--
mr.
tobias
simon
i
hardly
need
to
add
your
honor.
i
agree
with
your
honor's
statement,
i
hardly
need
to
add
that
in
florida,
there
are
a
great
number
of
people
who
feel
that
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
in
precisely
the
same
light
that
you
have
cast
under
these
other
amendments
to
the
constitution.
mr.
tobias
simon
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
we
have
persons
throughout
our
state
government,
sworn
to
uphold
the
constitution
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
interpreting
the
constitution
who
nevertheless
do
not
believe
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
believe
that
they
are
correct
or
proper
or
should
have
been
issued
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
tobias
simon
yes
your
honor.
mr.
tobias
simon
but
you
must
support
it.
you
must
--
mr.
tobias
simon
i
--
i
do
not
feel
that
that
is
anymore
consistent
than
requiring
that
a
man
working
to
amend
the
constitution
be
required
to
support
it
during
the
time
that
he
is
amending
it.
now,
what
your
honor
has
stated
maybe
so
and
the
decision
of
this
court
indicated
it
was
so
for
an
applicant
to
a
bar
which
is
of
course
within
the
peculiar
ability
of
a
court
to
set
as
to
the
qualifications
of
membership
of
attorneys
before
a
bar.
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
general
requirement
should
carry
over
into
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
public
employees
throughout
the
country
because
i
think
that
then
we
will
obtain
and
secure
a
situation
in
which
all
manners
of
beliefs
are
going
to
be
inquired
into
and
are
going
to
be
required
to
be
set
forth.
mr.
tobias
simon
i
assure
your
honor
i
am
--
mr.
tobias
simon
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
tobias
simon
no
sir.
i
--
mr.
tobias
simon
i
assure
your
honor
that
i
am
not
proposing
that
mr.
cramp
who
was
a
perfectly
good
teacher
until
five
minutes
before
he
was
presented
with
this
oath
or
five
minutes
after
he
go
out
and
smashed
things
up.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
he
was
a
good
teacher,
he
was
a
good
teacher
for
nine
years
without
the
state
knowing
the
first
thing
about
his
beliefs.
mr.
tobias
simon
and
i
--
mr.
tobias
simon
well
--
mr.
tobias
simon
i
sincerely
hope
so
your
honor
because
that
is
why
i
am
here.
that
is
what
--
mr.
tobias
simon
but
this
--
mr.
tobias
simon
oh
i
--
mr.
tobias
simon
i
do
not
understand
the
--
these
concepts
of
believing

--
i
--
mr.
tobias
simon
present
company
excluded
of
course,
your
honor,
i
would
venture
to
say
that
probably
nobody
does.
i
do
not
think
i
have
much
time
left.
mr.
tobias
simon
well
sir
i
--
mr.
tobias
simon
yes
your
honor.
mr.
tobias
simon
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
final
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
tobias
simon
the
court
will
note
from
the
brief
that
this
action
was
brought
in
orange
county,
florida
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
florida
statute
87.01
which
under
florida
law
permits
an
individual
who
is
in
doubt
as
to
his
status
and
his
rights
under
a
florida
statute
to
bring
an
action
for
declaratory
relief.
now,
this
is
not
a
procedure
that
is
available
in
every
state.
it
is
available
within
the
federal
system.
and
while
this
does
not
give
an
individual
the
right
to
ask
for
and
secure
an
advisory
opinion,
it
is
something
very
close
to
that.
it
does
give
him
the
right
to
have
the
court
adjudicate
for
him
whether
he
is
required
to
sign
--
in
this
case,
sign
this
oath
or
not.
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
there
were
at
least
and
not
less
than
six
points
raised
on
our
appeal
to
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
florida
supreme
court
answered
all
six
points,
five
of
them
in
a
substantive
manner.
they
said,
for
example,
that
the
question
of
scienter
was
no
longer
in
the
case.
they
said
that
the
question
of
preemption
of
subversion
under
the
nelson
case
is
no
longer
in
the
case.
they
ruled
specifically
on
the
question
of
whether
we
had
to
take
this
oath
or
whether
the
constitution
of
florida
limited
public
employees
to
a
constitutional
oath.
they
ruled
and
said
specifically
that
anybody
who
can
read
english
as
to
the
requirements
of
the
statute
knows
exactly
what
it
means
on
the
question
of
the
so-called
vice
of
vagueness.
they
also
said
that
due
process
and
first
amendment
provisions
were
not
applicable
and
then
and
only
then
on
pages
17,
18
and
19
of
the
record
did
they
come
to
the
question
of
ex
post
facto
and
bill
of
attainder
and
they
said
with
regard
to
these
questions
and
only
these
questions
do
we
maintain
that
there
is
no
standing
to
sue.
florida
did
not
say
that
there
was
no
standing
to
sue
with
regard
to
the
other
questions.
mr.
tobias
simon
it
is
not
surplusage
according
to
the
florida
supreme
court
with
regard
to
the
questions
of
ex
post
facto
and
bill
of
attainder.
they
said
that
this
man
cannot
raise
the
question
whether
--
and
they
said
specifically
on
page
19
of
the
record,
there
could
not
and
i
quote,
“there
could
not
possibly
be
a
legislative
adjudication
of
guilt
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
complaint
on
which
the
appellant
stands
and
set
up
firmly
points
out.”
they
said
the
same
thing
that
this
statute
could
not
constitute
an
ex
post
facto
law
as
to
this
appellant
but
they
did
not
say
that
this
appellant
was
not
permitted
to
raise
the
due
process
question
and
they
did
not
say
that
this
appellant
--
of
course
they
said
that
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process,
but
they
ruled
on
that
and
they
did
not
answer
the
other
questions
on
this
ground
which
if
they
have
wanted
to,
they
could
have
dismissed
our
entire
brief
and
our
entire
complaint
raising
six
assignments
of
error
on
this
last
one
and
they
did
not
do
it
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
florida
supreme
court
did
not
hold
that
there
was
no
standing
to
sue.
we
submit
that
where
this
man's
rights
are
being
invaded
as
we
maintain
they
are
by
forcing
him
to
do
something
as
a
condition
of
his
employment
which
he
is
not
required
to
do,
the
fact
that
he
is
willing
to
show
himself
in
a
good
life
to
this
court.
to
come
in
as
a
sheep
rather
than
as
a
goat
does
not
destroy
his
rights.
mr.
tobias
simon
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
do
not
feel
that
my
argument
has
to
reach
that
point.
there
may
be
cases
wherein
a
guard
of
the
president
may
be
inquired
--
one
may
require
him
to
express
his
belief
--
mr.
tobias
simon
i
have
not
represented
the
tva
nor
the
(voice
overlap)
of
the
act
and
i
would
--
mr.
tobias
simon
and
--
mr.
tobias
simon
my
answer
to
that
sir
is
that
that
particular
provision
in
my
opinion
and
based
upon
what
i
understand
to
be
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
that
the
federal
government
nor
the
government
of
florida
can
reach
into
a
man's
mind
and
require
it
to
be
divulged
as
the
condition
of
any
governmental
favor
or
employment.
mr.
tobias
simon
it
was
so
here
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
tobias
simon
thank
you
your
honor.
