justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
quite
understood
some
of
the
lines
you've
drawn.
suppose
a
man
was
about
to
be
appointed
to
a
job
of
this
government,
he
would
have
to
pass
on
the
jobs
desired
by
others.
he
should
be
asked
to
swear
that
i
believe
that
no
person
should
be
discriminated
against
on
account
of
race,
color
or
religion.
would
you
see
a
difference
between
that
and
the
oath
you
would
take
that
would
be
required
if
it
said
that
i
will
not
discriminate
on
account
of
race,
color
or
religion,
one
being
a
statement
of
what
he
believed
and
one
being
a
statement
of
what
he
would
do,
is
that
the
line
you're
drawing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
precisely
what
the
position
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
getting
into
this,
the
soundness
or
the
unsoundness
of
your
position
that
i
was
just
trying
to
clarify;
as
i
understand,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
congress
would
have
passed
a
law
requiring
all
candidates
for
congress
or
the
senate
to
swear
that
they
believe
in
the
operation
of
government
without
any
special
discrimination
against
any
group
that
that
would
not
be
a
good
requirement
and
--
but
that
it
would
be
quite
different
if
they
required
him
to
swear
that
he
would
not
conduct
his
office
in
such
way
as
to
deprive
that.
that
is
the
line
you're
drawing
whether
good
or
bad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
you're
taking,
arguing
literally
which
maybe
a
wrong
way
to
argue,
a
statement
made
by
mr.
justice
roberts
in
one
of
the
cases,
i've
forgotten
which
one,
substantially
to
the
effect
that
a
man's
beliefs
are
empowered,
but
his
conduct
can
be
regulated
for
the
good
of
society.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
that
you
disagree
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
understand
if
you
disagree
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
percentage
of
the
people
do
you
suppose
do
believe
that
every
single
provision
of
any
state
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
what's
supported.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
recall
once
from
the
--
many
constitutions
have
provided
that
there's
no
liquor
should
be
sold.
i'm
just
asking
what
percentage
would
you
make
of
the
people
that
take
an
oath
soundly
and
truthfully,
they
really
genuinely
believe
that
every
provisions
of
every
state
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
a
man
might
try
to
enforce
it
and
still
want
to
--
and
get
out
and
try
to
get
it
repealed,
might
he
not?
that
frequently
have
been,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
known
it
to
happen.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
knew
that
the
communist
party
intended
to
be
subversive,
had
full
knowledge
of
it,
he
attended
a
meeting
such
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
where
they
talked
about
various
things
where
this
man
was
the
chairman
of
the
meeting
or
made
a
speech
like
de
jonge
in
oregon,
would
you
say
that
the
fact
that
he
knew
about
it
would
take
away
from
him
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
freedom
to
be
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
a
speaker
had
preceded
him
who
advocated
the
communist
party
in
its
aims.
he
got
up
and
talked
on
a
perfectly
lawful
subject.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
if
he
had
talked
on
something
that
was
purposely
lawful,
advocated
the
cause
that
many
people
before
(inaudible)
that
the
jury
could
convict
him
if
they
thought
from
the
evidence
of
a
speaker
preceding
him
had
advocated
the
communist
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
too
wanted
--
he
too
wanted
to
aid
the
communist
party
looking
to
his
motives.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
then
you
wouldn't
look
to
his
motives.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
to
get
there
from
my
mind
about
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
argument
that
no
man
can
raise
this
who
is
not
affected
by
it
and
no
man
can
be
affected
by
it
unless
he's
been
guilty
of
the
things
which
it
prohibits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
your
idea
that
in
order
to
challenge
it,
he
must
show
--
he
comes
within
the
class
who
have
either
been
a
communist,
is
a
communist
who
has
advised,
aided
and
abetted
communists.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
hadn't
shown
he
has
not?
suppose
he
just
comes
in
and
says,
“i
want
to
raise
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
this”
and
they
say,
“well,
you've
got
to
show
you
were
within
the
class
by
denying
that
you
are
--
by
admitting
that
you
have
done
some
of
these
things.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
more
questionable?
but
if
it's
the
other
way,
if
--
why
wouldn't
it
be
here
that
if
a
--
is
it
your
argument
that
this
particular
man
does
not
have
the
right
standing
because
he
has
denied
that
he's
been
a
communist
or
is
it
your
idea
that
a
man
must
show
he
comes
within
the
class
that
it
touches,
which
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
didn't
come
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
just
comes
and
says,
“i'm
not
going
to
answer
this.
the
laws
are
unconstitutional.”
and
they
say,
“well,
does
it
affect
you?”
he
said,
“i
won't
say
it.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
he
have
standing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
he
decided
to
come
in
--
when
he's
got
to
come
in
and
do
as
i
--
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
come
in
first
and
either
admit
that
he
is
a
communist
or
has
done
these
things
under
which
--
under
which
circumstances,
he
would
have
standing
to
challenge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
standing
the
question
of
this
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not,
what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
the
only
one
you
claim
that
he
doesn't
have
standing
to
raise
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
he
doesn't
have
the
right
to
raise
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
quite
get
what
a
man
would
have
the
right
to
challenge.
i've
always
--
suppose
that
the
only
--
that
the
man
had
have
a
right
to
challenge
the
law,
he's
accused
of
doing
something
under
it
and
that
he
wouldn't
have
to
come
in
and
admit
that
he'd
done
it
before
he'd
have
standing
to
sue
--
to
challenge
it.
he
doesn't
have
to
do
that,
does
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
doesn't
have
to
admit
he
comes
within
the
class
that
covers,
does
he,
so
far
as
his
conduct
is
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
he
does
under
communist
act
but
not
generally,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you
if
you
don't
think
that's
happened
here,
do
you?
he
hadn't
come
in
and
said
that
i
can't
possibly
be
touched
by
this
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
has
--
suppose
he
has,
how
does
he
know
that
the
state
must
--
that
he
hasn't
done
would
not
be
disapproved
by
a
group
of
informers
or
group
of
other
people,
how
could
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
is
true
that
a
person
has
no
standing
to
sue
in
the
florida
court,
do
you
think
he's
having
a
standing
to
raise
this
constitutional
question
in
any
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
so
where
would
it
be
but
the
federal
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
--
that's
arguing
the
merits
of
the
rule
not
what
i
understood
justice
harlan
to
be
talking
about
that
this
is
a
florida
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
mooney
and
holohan
that
florida
won't
let
him
raise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
rule
in
mooney
and
holohan
that
florida
will
not
let
him
raise
this
constitutional
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
right
to
raise
it
in
the
federal
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
idea
that
your
florida
rule
is
intended
to
be
played
that
whether
the
federal
rule
required
to
be
not
--
this
man
shall
not
be
allowed
to
raise
this
constitutional
question
in
the
florida
court
under
the
circumstances
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
arguing
that
it's
still
the
florida
rule
or
that
you're
following
the
federal
court
to
say
it
has
no
chance
to
--
suppose
you're
wrong
on
the
federal
rule
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
do
you
still
say
that
florida
will
deny
him
relief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
florida.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
would
result
in
--
meaning
that
the
man
can
have
his
constitutional
right
violated
with
no
possible
remedy
in
the
federal
or
state
court.
i
thought
mooney
and
holohan
held
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
mooney
versus
holohan
where
the
question
was
whether
california
has
failed
to
give
a
remedy
where
there
was
a
charge
that
the
man
had
been
convicted
on
perjurious
evidence
knowing
that
the
evidence
was
--
the
state
knowing
it
was
fault.
that
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
court
held
that
it
would
not
have
--
as
i
recall
it.
i
haven't
read
it
yet,
(inaudible)
it
would
not
assume
that
california
would
not
give
a
relief
in
the
federal
constitution
is
violated,
the
man
is
condemned
from
the
consideration
on
that
basis.
i
think
that
was
(inaudible)
--
