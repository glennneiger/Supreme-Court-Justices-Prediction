jr.,
appellant,
versus
board
of
public
instruction
of
orange
county,
florida.
mr.
simon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
simon,
we'll
reduce
it
to
very
simple
terms.
you
--
you
make
a
distinction
i
take
it
that
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
require
a
public
employee
to
swear
that
he
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
but
that
it
is
improper
to
compel
him
to
say
that
he
believes
in
every
article
of
the
--
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
a
prerequisite
to
getting
a
public
job.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
--
i
point
that
out
because
there
are
a
great
many
people
today
who
are
in
the
news
all
the
time,
claiming
that
the
provision
for
an
income
tax
is
the
work
of
communism
in
this
country
and
he
could
demand
who
had
that
belief
could
hardly
take
the
kind
of
an
oath
that
is
presented
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
are
others
who
believe
that
the
provision
allowing
women
to
vote
is
wrong.
there
are
people
who
don't
yet
believe
in
the
direct
election
of
the
united
states
senators,
but
if
all
those
people
can
--
would
be
debarred
because
they
believe
that
way
even
though
they
conscientiously
would
take
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
it
would
debar
a
lot
of
people,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
simon,
but
--
also,
i
think
there
are
some
states
in
--
i'm
trying
to
think
my
own,
i
ought
to
know
because
i
took
the
oath
a
good
many
times,
but
i
think
there
are
a
good
many
of
them
that
require
a
man
to
--
to
take
an
oath
that
he
will
not
only
support
the
constitution,
but
the
laws
of
the
state
of
california.
now,
they
don't
carry,
the
laws
don't
carry
that
implicit
thing
in
them
for
--
for
repeal
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
--
has
been
talking
about.
but
i
suppose
that
when
i
took
the
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
state
--
constitution
and
laws
of
the
state
of
california
that
i
wasn't
saying
that
i
believe
in
the
wisdom
and
the
policy
of
every
law
that
was
on
our
statute
books.
i
took
the
oath
that
i
would
support
them
because
they
were
on
the
statute
books
and
there
is
a
difference
between
belief
in
what
you
will
--
what
you
will
do
as
a
public
official.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
dis
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
distinction
without
a
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
mr.
--
you
may
mr.
simon.
mr.
wells.
we
haven't
much
time
but
you
can
get
started.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
wells.
[recess]
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wells,
in
that
--
in
that
case,
what
phase
of
the
oath
was
alleged
to
be
precarious
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
it
allege?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
facts
were
alleged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
conclusions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well,
was
it
just
conclusory
that
--
that
he
lent
his
aid
and
support
but
--
or
did
they
charge
--
charge
that
he
had
--
had
given
some
specific
support.
i
just
didn't
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
its
--
if
you
don't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
can
you
apply
that
rule
of
scienter
to
beliefs?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead
please,
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
counsel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wells,
may
i
ask
you
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
this
question?
assuming
for
the
moment
that
this
oath
does
invade
constitutional
rights
under
certain
circumstances,
just
assuming
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
no
redress
can
be
given
to
an
admittedly
loyal
american
citizen
just
because
he
asserts
his
loyalty.
but
on
the
other
hand,
redress
is
restricted
to
communists
who
are
admittedly
disloyal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we've
got
the
two
extremes,
two
poles
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
wasn't
the
question
i
asked
you.
i
asked
you
admittedly,
is
--
is
redress
denied
to
a
man
who
assertedly
and
admittedly
is
a
loyal
citizen,
but
on
the
contrary
that
any
redress
open
to
anyone
if
there
is
an
invasion
of
constitutional
rights
is
limited
to
communists
who
are
admittedly
disloyal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
regardless
of
whether
he
claims
to
be
loyal
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'll
put
it
this
way.
in
other
words,
if
he
is
--
if
he
is
a
loyal
american
citizen
and
that
should
close
the
book,
shouldn't
it
on
the
situation,
he
can
be
compelled
to
take
this
kind
--
kind
of
an
oath
but
if
he
is
a
communist
and
is
disloyal,
he
need
not
--
he
need
not
take
it,
assuming
that
there
is
some
invasion
of
constitutional
rights.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
tell
me
this
then.
what
rights
of
a
communist
can
be
invaded
and
be
subject
to
redress
without
the
same
invasion
giving
a
loyal
american
citizen
a
right
to
redress?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
suppose
a
man
--
a
man
like
justice
frankfurter
was
talking
about,
a
man
who
had
supported
certain
causes
that
the
communist
party
supports.
suppose
he
supported
a
broad
program
of
public
housing,
a
broad
program
of
maternal
care,
broad
program
of
let
us
say
public
medicine
and
things
of
that
kind,
suppose
he
supported
those
things
permanently
but
did
not
support
any
of
their
subversive
programs,
would
he
then
--
would
he
--
wouldn't
he
then
have
a
--
have
to
stop,
look
and
listen
before
he
signed
any
such
affidavit
for
fear,
three
or
four
half
a
dozen
people
would
say
i
saw
him
on
the
platform
with
so
and
so.
i
saw
him
when
the
communists
were
advocating
this
or
advocating
that.
he
spoke
from
those
very,
very
things
in
company
with
them
on
the
same
platform.
wouldn't
a
man
in
that
position
be
in
a
delicate
--
delicate
position
to
sign
an
affidavit
of
that
kind
on
the
question
of
beliefs
and
counsel
and
aid
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
could
he
--
when
--
where
could
he
raise
it?
when
he's
charged
with
perjury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
procedure
for
that
in
florida?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
the
man
was
in
this
position.
suppose
he
said
--
he
said,
“yes,
i
was
--
i
was
very
much
in
favor
with
all
of
these
things
and
i
have
--
have
enumerated
and
i
did
cooperate
with
the
--
with
the
communist
party
when
they
were
advocating
such
things
but
i
have
no
truck
at
all
with
their
other
--
with
their
other
beliefs
but
i
did
counsel
with
them.
i
did
advice
them,
i
did
--
i
did
talk
with
them
on
the
--
on
the
platform.”
what
would
his
position
be
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
anything
in
--
in
--
in
the
statute
or
in
the
decisions
of
your
florida
supreme
court
which
hold
that
the
--
that
the
cooperation
and
the
--
and
the
counseling
and
assistance
and
so
forth
that
is
contemplated
by
this
oath
must
be
as
to
those
facets
of
the
communist
party
that
have
to
do
with
overthrowing
our
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
it
say?
where
--
where
can
we
find
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
simon.
