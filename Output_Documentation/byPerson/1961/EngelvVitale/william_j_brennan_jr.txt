justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
--
where
is
the
statement
incorporating
the
regents'
statement,
where
--
is
that
in
the
resolution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
but
i
thought
you've
suggested
earlier
that
all
of
the
reasons.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
would
be
irrespective
whether
the
children
maybe
excused
or
whether
they
may
remain
silent,
whether
--
whether
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
on
the
matter
of
silence,
i
gather
there's
no
question
that
a
child
may
remain
silent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
the
whole
premise
though
of
your
argument
is
that
this
prayer
is
teaching,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
have
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
well
have
you
concluded
your
argument
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
the
teaching
of
religion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
i
understand
you
to
say
before
that
even
if
on
this
record
it
can't
be
said
that
that
statement
was
incorporated
in
this
board's
resolution,
you
would
still
be
arguing
that
on
its
face,
we
must
read
the
prayer
as
teaching
religion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
have
you
concluded
that
the
argument
is
to
that
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
butler
you
--
i'm
still
puzzled
whether
how
much
of
your
argument
raised
--
rest
basically
on
the
notion
that
this
is
teaching
religion.
you
said
earlier,
i
think,
that
you
answered
me
first
that
it
--
much
of
it
did,
and
then
later
you
withdrew
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
in
that
respect,
how
do
you
differ
"god
save
united
states"
in
this
honorable
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it's
not
in
the
schoolroom.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
do
you
come
back,
basically,
that
your
argument
does
rest
on
the
proposition
that
this
prayer
is
the
teaching?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
under
the
free
exercise
or
the
establishment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
because
it's
a
schoolroom.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
last
question,
mr.
butler.
suppose
this
prayer
in
the
schoolroom
were
"god
save
the
united
states
and
the
school".
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
my
interpretation
of
anything.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
of
your
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
supposed
it
followed
up
the
salute
to
the
flag,
instead
of
with
this
prayer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
with
each
children
in
unison
saying,
"god
save
the
united
states
and
this
school".
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
same
--
everything
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
is
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
instead
of
this
regents'
prayer
that
was
the
one
that
i
--
prayer
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everything
is
exactly
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
same.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everything
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
is
in
this
case
except
that's
what's
said
by
the
children
instead
of
regents'
prayer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
and
you
do
come
back
that
this
is
teaching
religion.
