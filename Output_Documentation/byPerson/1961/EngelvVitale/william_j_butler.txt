mr.
william
j.
butler
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
if
the
court
pleases,
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
affirmed
an
order
dismissing
a
petition
of
the
lower
courts
which
alleged
in
effect
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
saying
of
a
religious
prayer
at
the
opening
of
the
school
day
in
the
public
schools
of
long
island.
before
i
get
into
the
facts
of
the
case
which
raise
in
our
opinion
grave
constitutional
problems,
i'd
like
to
state
to
the
court
that
it's
our
fundamental
and
basic
thesis
that
this
is
one
of
those
cases
which
involves
an
attempt
by
the
state
to
introduce
religious
education
and
observances
into
the
public
school
system
of
our
nation.
mr.
william
j.
butler
this
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
mr.
justice
harlan,
this
is
a
recommendation
by
the
board
of
regents
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
all
school
districts
and
it
has
been
adopted
by
many
of
the
school
districts
throughout
the
state
of
new
york.
the
exact
number
of
school
districts
that
have
adopted
the
saying
of
this
prayer,
it
is
unknown
from
the
record
except
that
it
is
in
a
substantial
amount
of
school
districts
within
the
state.
before
continuing
and
getting
into
the
specific
facts
of
the
argument,
we
think
it
issue
here
fundamentally
is
the
government's
role
in
the
religious
education
of
our
youth
through
the
public
school
system
of
our
nation.
to
what
extent
the
question
will
be
raised?
can
a
state
participate
in
the
religious
training
of
our
youth?
to
what
extent
can
it
insert
in
its
compulsory
institutions,
prayers
or
religious
observances?
the
instant
prayer
or
the
instant
religious
activity
or
exercise
arose
from
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
regents
of
the
state
of
new
york
on
november
30th,
1951.
at
that
time,
the
board
of
regents
which
in
effect
is
the
highest
educational
authority
in
the
state
of
new
york,
issued
a
statement
entitled,
"the
regent
statement
on
moral
and
spiritual
training
in
schools".
this
authority,
which
sets
the
educational
standards
of
all
of
the
public
schools
of
new
york
state,
in
a
statement
i
issued
on
that
day,
and
i'd
like
to
quote
from
it
since
it
is
very
brief,
stated
simply
as
follows.
mr.
william
j.
butler
at
page
28
of
the
record.
if
the
court
so
pleases,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
butler
at
folio
84,
said,
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
board
of
regents.
in
our
opinion,
the
securing
of
the
peace
and
safety
of
our
country
and
our
state
against
such
dangers
points
to
the
essentiality
of
teaching
our
children
as
set
forth
in
the
declaration
of
independence
that
almighty
god
is
their
creator
and
that
by
him,
they
have
been
endowed
with
their
any
legible
rights
of
life,
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness.
we
believe
that
at
the
commencement
of
each
school
day,
the
act
of
allegiance
to
the
flag
might
well
be
joined
with
this
act
of
reverence
to
god
"almighty
god,
we
acknowledge
our
dependence
upon
thee,
and
we
beg
thy
blessings
upon
us,
our
parents,
our
teachers
and
our
country."
further
at
page
29,
folio
87,
the
regents
concluded
by
saying,
"we
believe
that
thus
the
school
will
fulfill
its
high
function
of
supplementing
the
training
of
the
home,
ever
intensifying
in
the
child
that
love
for
god,
for
parents,
and
for
home
which
is
the
mark
of
true
character,
training,
and
a
sure
guarantee
of
a
country's
welfare."
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
william
j.
butler
now,
the
spe
--
the
specific
act,
your
honor,
is
the
local
board's
issuance
of
a
resolution
and
an
order
to
the
local
school
principal
of
the
school
located
within
the
board's
district
instructing
that
the
opening
--
the
opening
of
the
school
day
after
the
salute
to
the
flag
that
this
prayer
recommended
by
the
board
of
regents
and
for
the
reasons
recommended
by
the
board
of
regents
be
said
daily,
led
by
a
teacher
in
unison
with
all
other
members
of
the
class.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
your
honor.
exactly.
this
is
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
this
is
the
specific
prayer
that
is
required
to
be
read
that
i've
just
read
to
you,
your
honor,
that's
why
i
thought
the
court
will
be
interested
in
hearing
this
prayer
itself.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
manner
in
which
it's
read
and
the
facts
surrounding
the
reading
of
the
prayer
--
by
participation
in
the
prayer
by
the
teachers
or
the
state
officials
which
i
also
think
is
an
important
fact
in
view
of
your
honor's
caveat
in
--
in
several
other
cases.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
legal
principles
involved.
but
i
thought
the
court
(voice
overlap)
might
like
to
be
informed
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
which
are
alleged
in
our
petition.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
my
sole
purpose
in
--
in
reading
these
two
paragraphs
to
show
the
court
the
motive
behind
the
saying
of
the
prayer
why
it
was
introduced
in
the
school
system
and
exactly
what
they
--
what
the
state
authority
recommended
that
was
adopted
by
the
local
school
board.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
it
adopted
the
state
--
this
statement
that
i
have
just
read
of
the
board
of
regents
and
directed
that
the
prayer
recommended
in
the
statement
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
--
he
said
daily
in
the
public
schools
of
their
district.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
it
adopted
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
--
the
statement
of
the
board
of
regents.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
yes,
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
it
says
that
it's
moved
in
second
that
the
regents'
prayer
be
said
daily
in
our
schools
and
that
the
board
of
regent
--
education
give
direction
to
the
principal
that
this
be
instituted
as
a
daily
procedure
to
follow
the
salute
to
the
flag.
mr.
william
j.
butler
recommended,
yes
your
honor.
it
is
--
new
york
state
has
a
school
system
which
local
autonomies
kept
in
the
local
school
districts
to
a
certain
extent.
and
this
was
not
a
mandatory
requirement
of
the
board
of
regents.
it
was
left
to
the
local
school
boards
to
adopt
or
not
to
adopt.
in
this
particular
instance
in
--
on
july
8,
1958,
several
years
after
the
statement
came
out,
this
local
school
board
at
a
meeting
by
majority
vote
adopted
this
prayer
and
ordered
it
instituted
in
the
public
school
of
their
district.
and
since
that
time
to
the
very
--
this
very
day,
it
said
each
day
after
the
salute
to
the
flag
led
by
a
teacher
or
by
a
student.
mr.
william
j.
butler
there
is
an
affidavit
of
william
j.
vitale,
mr.
justice
brennan
on
page
24
of
the
record
--
on
page
26,
your
honor
at
folio
77,
the
--
the
head
of
this
board
of
education
states
in
an
affidavit
submitted
in
this
proceeding
that
with
such
two
strong
recommendations
by
the
board
of
regents
and
the
state
administrative
officer
that
was
brought
before
the
herricks
board
of
education,
the
adoption
of
a
prayer
as
part
of
the
daily
procedure,
and
on
july
8,
a
resolution
was
adopted
providing
the
same.
mr.
william
j.
butler
i
take
it
to
say
it
means
the
prayer,
doesn't
it?
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
think
it
may
--
may
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
it
may
have
applied
to
the
strong
recommendations
by
the
board
of
regents.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
it's
our
position
here,
if
the
court
please,
that
this
affidavit
of
william
j.
vitale
does
indicate
that
the
reasons
why
the
board
adopted
the
resolution
it
did
was
because
it
had
adopted
the
recommenda
--
the
board
of
regents'
statement,
the
recommendations
of
the
board
of
regents
in
its
entitlement.
mr.
william
j.
butler
it
still
would
be
offensive,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
i
would
rather
state
it
your
honor
but
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
it's
our
position
that
it
adopted
by
this
affidavit,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
anyway,
after
july
8,
1958
in
a
response
to
the
order
of
the
board
of
education
in
this
particular
school
district,
this
prayer
was
recited
daily
in
the
public
schools
of
this
district.
each
day,
after
the
school
bell
opened
at
school
day,
the
students
would
salute
the
flag
of
the
united
states.
mr.
william
j.
butler
absolutely
none,
your
honor.
after
the
salute
to
the
flag
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
pledge
of
allegiance.
mr.
william
j.
butler
as
amended,
yes,
mr.
--
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
after
the
salute
to
the
flag,
this
prayer
is
said.
now,
we
think
that
the
manner
in
which
it's
said
is
also
important
in
this
case
because
if
the
saying
of
a
prayer,
number
one,
is
said
unison
with
all
members
of
a
class,
participated.
also,
it's
led
by
a
teacher
in
the
particular
classroom
where
the
prayer
is
being
said.
and
in
some
occasions,
the
teacher
nominates
a
nominee
or
a
child
or
a
student
in
that
particular
class
to
leave
the
saying
of
this
prayer.
initially,
when
this
case
was
first
started,
both
the
saying
of
the
prayer
in
the
classroom
and
the
participation
by
each
student
was
mandatory.
after
the
decision
in
the
lower
court
which
entered
into
an
interlocutory
decree
holding
the
mandatory
saying
of
the
prayer
under
these
circumstances
unconstitutional,
the
local
school
board
changed
its
resolution,
made
the
prayer
voluntary,
said
that
any
child
could
be
excused
provided
the
parent
of
any
child
wrote
a
letter
to
the
principal
asking
that
the
children
be
excused
from
the
saying
of
the
prayer.
subsequent
to
this
time,
a
final
order
was
entered
after
the
school
board
had
instituted
the
voluntary
procedure
aspect
of
the
case
dismissing
the
petition.
and
it's
this
particular
order
that
has
gone
up
through
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
its
present
consideration
here.
as
it
is
now,
the
saying
of
the
prayer
is
voluntary,
any
parent
can
ask
the
principal
to
have
his
child
excuse
from
the
saying
of
the
prayer.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
the
record
is
void,
mr.
justice
clark,
as
to
any
request
by
any
parent
to
have
his
child
excuse
from
this
exercise.
i
can't
go
outside
the
record
except
to
say
that
no
child
has
been
excused
from
the
saying
of
this
prayer
upon
a
request
from
his
parent
because
such
request
is
not
--
just
not
in
the
record.
we
have
no
knowledge
of
any
such
request
which
we
think
is
very
important
in
a
later
argument
which
i
hope
to
make
concerning
the
free
exercise
part
of
the
legal
concepts
which
arise
from
these
facts.
mr.
william
j.
butler
the
rec
--
yes,
i
did,
your
honor.
the
records
do
not
show
that
any
request
was
ever
made
to
excuse
the
child
from
the
classroom.
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
of
one
request
that
the
child
be
permitted
to
remain
silent
during
the
saying
of
this
prayer.
and
that's
all
the
record
says
along
the
lines
of
request
mr.
frankfurter.
mr.
william
j.
butler
a
request
by
a
parent.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
the
petitioners
here
are
parents.
they're
composed
of
two
people
of
the
jewish
faith,
one
of
the
faith
of
the
society
or
ethical
culture,
one
of
the
unitarian
faith
and
one,
a
non-believer.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
their
exact
grievance
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes
--
of
course,
your
honor.
your
--
the
exact
grievance
stated
by
the
parents
and
the
one
on
which
we
most
heavily
rely
is
that
this
practice
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states.
now
secondarily,
we
argue
legally
that
it
also
violates
the
free
exercise
part
of
the
first
amendment
and
that
it
has
the
effect
of
coercing
these
children
to
participate
in
this
religious
proceeding.
we're
adopting
in
our
secondary
argument
which
i
was
going
to
get
to,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
your
brilliant
dissertation
in
mccollum
where
you
said
the
law
of
limitation
applies
and
that
known
conformity
is
not
an
outstanding
characteristic
of
little
children.
and
that
argument
was
going
to
make
very
strongly
on
the
free
exercise
side
of
our
argument.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
i
--
thank
you,
sir.
to
get
back
to
the
--
to
the
saying
of
a
prayer
and
the
manner
of
which
it
said,
it's
still
said
everyday
in
the
school
system.
and
as
i've
said,
children
can
be
excused
although
there
is
no
--
not
--
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
any
child
actually
leaves
a
room
and
the
participation
by
the
teacher
and
the
student.
mr.
william
j.
butler
now,
legally
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
well
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
--
i'd
like
to
take
one
by
one
each
of
the
five
fathers
and
state
each
of
their
grievances
because
each
of
their
grievances
are
different.
they
have
all
what
--
they
all
though
have
one
thing
in
common.
and
that
is,
that
they
say
that
this
is
in
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment,
that
this
is
an
illegal
use
of
state
properties,
state
funds,
state
jud
--
educational
system
to
aid
all
religions
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
--
or
to
aid
some
religions
against
others.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
mr.
ju
--
totally
irrespective
of
the
free
exercise
argument
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
and
also
a
child
may
remain
silent
as
much
as
he
maybe
excused.
there
is
no
direct
compulsion
by
the
school
authorities
compelling
the
child
to
say
the
prayer.
a
compulsion
that
we
argue
was
subtle.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
mr.
justice
clark,
that's
a
--
that's
a
--
you
see
the
--
the
salute
to
the
flag
takes
about
10
seconds
or
15
seconds
and
then
they
go
right
into
the
prayer
which
takes
another
20
or
30
seconds.
so
the
child
would
have
to
--
they
have
to
stop
after
the
salute
to
the
flag,
and
send
the
child
out
of
the
room
somewhere
and
then
after
the
prayer
was
said,
have
somebody
go
out
and
tell
the
child
to
come
back
in.
but
the
record
is
void
of
any
such
request.
mr.
william
j.
butler
high
schools
also.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
now
they
have
--
they've
been
progressing
along
in
schools
since
the
case
started.
mr.
william
j.
butler
done
in
each
classroom,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
right.
and
i
think
that
there
are
60
--
8
--
12
--
12
classrooms,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
mr.
justice
stewart,
just
asked
the
same
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
doesn't
it
sound
like
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not
appear.
mr.
william
j.
butler
of
course,
we
contend
as
i've
said
basically
that
the
saying
of
this
prayer
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
we
rely
very
heavily
on
this
court's
decision
on
the
mccollum
case.
and
rather
than
go
through
all
of
the
points
in
the
mccollum
case
which
this
court
will
--
will
remember
as
one
of
the
justice's
remark.
i'd
rather
take
mr.
justice
warren's
points
in
mcgowan
against
maryland
where
mr.
justice
warren
compared
the
facts
in
the
mcgowan
case
to
the
mccollum
case
indicating
that
there
were
four
or
five
major
factual
points
in
mccollum
that
should
be
applied
in
all
of
the
establishment
cases.
now
bearing
in
mind,
of
course,
the
mccollum
was
the
only
case
that
this
court
has
established
violat
--
has
held
violated
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
first
contention
that
we
make
to
bring
our
case
within
the
mccollum
doctrine,
is
that
the
religious
activities
we're
during
school
hours.
covered
we
--
we
call
in
the
mccollum
case
this
was
true
that
the
students
were
left
out
of
the
main
classroom
to
go
to
other
classrooms
within
the
buildings
to
take
religious
instruction.
second
fact
is
that
there
was
a
direct
cooperation
in
the
mccollum
case
between
state
officials
and
religious
activity
and
that
particular
instance
as
was
cooperation
between
the
state
and
sectarian
religious
activity.
in
our
case,
the
direct
cooperation,
of
course,
is
the
fact
that
the
teacher
participates
in
the
saying
of
a
prayer,
leads
the
prayer
and
cooperates
in
carrying
out
the
mandate
of
the
board
of
education
requiring
religious
training
in
the
public
schools
to
this
extent.
the
third
factor
is
that
tax
supported
buildings
were
used
to
aid
in
the
teaching
of
religion
in
the
public
school
system.
this
was
one
of
the
--
also
of
course,
one
of
the
main
points
in
zorach
where
this
court
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
in
zorach,
the
tax
supported
buildings
were
not
used
to
aid
religion
or
religions
or
to
prefer
one
religion
against
the
other.
the
fourth
is
that
the
children
who
do
not
--
did
--
did
not
participate
in
the
religious
instruction
on
the
mccollum
case
didn't
have
to.
it
was
a
voluntary
on
part
of
the
parents
to
send
their
teacher
to
the
particular
sectarian
religious
instruction.
of
course
in
our
case,
the
same
thing
occurs
because
it
is
voluntary
that
parents
can
refuse
to
have
their
children
participate
in
this
religious
activity.
and
finally,
the
participation,
and
this
is
practically
the
same
as
the
last
point,
is
the
same
bec
--
because
it's
limited
to
children
whose
parents
consent
to
participate
in
the
--
in
the
activity
itself.
there's
one
major
difference
however
between
the
mccollum
case
and
our
case
which
we
think
makes
our
case
more
stronger
or
stronger
than
the
mccollum
case
and
that
is
the
fact
that
there's
teacher
participation.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
your
honor.
it's
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
it's
--
it's
--
now,
the
premises
--
the
premise
of
our
argument
is
that
it
is
teaching
religion
--
of
religion
in
a
public
institution.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
i
--
i
--
it's
--
i
can
only
go
back
one
until
the
statement
of
the
board
of
regents
which
had
it
as
its
main
purpose
as
i
read
to
the
court
that
the
main
function
of
the
inclusion
of
this
prayer
in
the
public
school's
system
was
"the
essentiality
of
teaching
religion"
in
the
public
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
i
also
--
i
would
also
make
that
point,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
i
think
and
also,
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
--
there's
no
dispute
between
me
and
my
--
and
my
friends
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
the
purpose
of
saying
this
prayer.
it's
consent
--
it's
agreed
upon
that
the
reason
why
this
prayer
is
said
everyday
in
the
public
schools
is
to
inculcate
into
the
children
our
love
for
god
and
a
respect
for
the
almighty.
and
there's
just
no
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
religious
activity
is
designed
to
bring
the
children
into
a
religious
activity
which
in
the
long
run
my
friend
say
will
preserve
the
religious
and
even
christian
heritage
of
our
society.
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
your
honor.
i
want
to
make
it
absolutely
clear
before
this
court
that
i
come
here
not
as
an
antagonist
of
religion,
that
my
clients
are
deeply
religious
people,
that
we
come
here
in
the
firm
belief
that
the
best
safety
of
religion
in
the
united
states
and
freedom
of
religion
is
to
keep
religion
out
of
our
public
life
and
not
to
confound
as
roger
williams
said
the
civil
with
the
religious.
i
don't
take
issue
with
the
goodness
or
the
badness
of
this
prayer.
i
say
prayer
is
good.
my
clients
say
prayer
is
good.
but
what
we
say
here
is
that
it's
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
religious
freedom
when
religious
activity
such
as
this
is
incorporated
in
the
public
school
system
of
the
united
states.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
it
does
not
--
we
do
not.
i
don't
--
i
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
i
said
that's
one
of
the
aspects
of
this
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
of
course,
i
don't.
of
course,
i
know
that
teaching
isn't
the
only
religious
activity
that's
prohibited.
teaching
of
religion
is
the
only
religious
activity
that's
prohibited
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
an
act
of
compelling
someone
to
believe
in
a
religious
belief
i
think
is
also
outlined
by
the
constitution.
coming
to
the
barnette
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
which
i'm
very
happy
you
brought
up
at
this
time.
in
answering
your
question
specifically
in
your
own
words,
you
said
that
an
act
compelling
profession
of
allegiance
to
a
religion
no
matter
how
subtly
or
tenuously
promoted
as
bad
but
an
act
promoting
good
citizenship
and
national
legions
is
within
the
domain
of
governmental
authority.
and
i
think
that
--
i
agree
with
that
statement.
and
that's
if
this
act
--
if
this
prayer,
and
we
say
it
does,
is
an
act
compelling
profession
of
allegiance
to
a
god
that
that's
an
illegal
activity
also
barred
by
the
first
amendment,
by
the
establishment.
mr.
william
j.
butler
mr.
justice
harlan,
of
course,
that's
not
the
facts
of
my
case.
mr.
william
j.
butler
and
i
would
ra
--
to
answer
that
question
legally
and
as
a
--
as
a
lawyer,
i
would
have
to
know
a
great
deal
more
about
the
circumstances
surround
the
saying
of
the
bible.
but
let's
assume
it
just
--
excuse
me.
yes,
sir?
mr.
william
j.
butler
let's
assume
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
you
just
assume
that
just
the
bible
reading
be
said
in
the
public
school
system
10
verses
of
the
bible.
your
honor
didn't
mention
which
version,
the
king
james
version
or
the
douay
version?
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
i
would
--
i
would
say
--
i
would
agree
with
the
holding
in
the
schempp
case,
schempp
against
abington
which
has
been
recently
re-decided
in
philadelphia,
three-judge
constitutional
court,
that
the
saying
of
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible
which
is
the
box
in
that
case
was
unconstitutional
as
an
attempt
by
the
state
to
insert
in
its
compulsory
institutions
an
act
of
religious
prayer.
mr.
william
j.
butler
that's
not
the
question
in
this
case.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
your
honor,
quite
different
question
in
this
case.
because
this
case
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
--
is
not
the
bible,
it's
the
state
making
up
the
prayer.
mr.
william
j.
butler
did
you
add
the
word
"meditation",
mr.
justice?
mr.
william
j.
butler
i
can't
--
i
would
say
that
that
is
not
--
i
don't
see
any
argument
first
unconstitutionality.
mr.
william
j.
butler
not
as
you
state
it
your
honor.
i
will
reserve
my
right
to
inquire
into
any
additional
facts.
mr.
william
j.
butler
excuse
me.
mr.
william
j.
butler
i
would
definitely
without
any
hesitation,
mr.
justice
douglas,
say
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
j.
butler
because
i
think
any
religious
act,
any
attempt
by
the
state
to
impose
any
religious
view
or
to
engage
in
any
kind
of
religious
activity
if
the
purpose
of
the
saying
of
the
prayer
is
to
compel
a
belief
in
a
religion.
mr.
william
j.
butler
of
course,
i
draw
a
distinguished
--
i
distinguished
between
teaching
religion
and
teaching
about
religion
which
is
a
quite
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
if
the
purpose
of
--
of
the
reading
of
the
bible
is
to
inculcate
into
the
children
a
belief
in
a
religion,
i
think
this
is
activity
on
the
part
of
state
inspired
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
j.
butler
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional
i
think.
that's
the
distinguishing
fact
that
this
court
made
in
the
torcaso
case.
this
court
said
in
torcaso
that
theistic
religions
are
only
one
kind
of
religion.
there
are
also
non-theistic
religions.
there
are
concepts
--
religious
concepts
which
don't
have
god
as
their
ultimate
goal.
buddhism,
american
culture
society,
taoism,
human
secularism,
all
of
those
religions
were
mentioned
by
this
court
in
the
torcaso
case
when
it
said
that
belief
does
not
have
to
be
in
a
theistic
religion.
it
can
also
be
a
belief
in
a
non-theistic
religion.
and
equally
thereby
by
the
first
amendment
if
the
purpose
of
the
used
is
to
use
the
state
to
impose
upon
or
to
inculcate
into
children
a
belief,
any
--
any
religious
belief.
i
think
the
constitution
is
involved.
mr.
william
j.
butler
if
the
reason,
mr.
justice
douglas,
is
a
re
--
is
a
religious
reason,
but
the
purpose
is
to
use
the
state
authority
to
--
to
promote
one
religion
regardless
of
what
it
is
of
course
it's
unconstitutional.
i
wouldn't
bar
it
from
the
public
schools
nor
do
i
think
this
court
would
sustain
any
principle
of
teaching
about
religion.
i
think
that's
part
of
the
concept
of
public
education
that
all
subject
should
be
free
to
be
taught
in
the
public
school.
but
when
it
engages
in
religious
activity,
where
the
avowed
purposes
to
promote
religion,
one
religion,
all
religions
and
i
think
this
is
barred.
it's
a
kind
of
activity
by
the
first
amendment.
i'd
like
if
i
--
if
i
may
step
--
go
a
step
further
in
discussing
the
free
exercise
side
of
the
--
of
the
first
amendment
because
we
think
that
not
only
does
this
set
of
facts
of
this
religious
activity
violate
the
establishment
clause
and
also
the
free
exercise
clause.we're
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
the
saying
of
this
prayer
is
voluntary
and
that
no
one
is
actually
--
no
child
is
actually
expressly
compelled
to
say
this
prayer.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
i'd
--
i'm
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
that
--
that
makes
a
great
difference
for
--
for
two
main
reasons,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
sounds
familiar
with
your
honor's
opinion
in
the
--
you
mention
that
in
the
zorach
case.
there
are
two
main
distinguishing
facts
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
if
i
remember
your
honor
reminding
himself
in
zorach.
yes,
i
think
there
is
a
great
difference.
mr.
william
j.
butler
what
side,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
no
--
it
has
not
been
decided
from
this
court.
mr.
william
j.
butler
it
is,
your
honor,
i'm
glad
i'm
not
bringing
it.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
as
a
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
recalled
--
i
recall
very
vividly
readings
the
madison's
attack
on
chaplains
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
in
the
--
in
the
senate.
madison
took
a
distinct
position
that
he
thought
that
the
use
of
chaplains
by
both
sides
of
the
house
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
j.
butler
i
--
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
could
make
a
first
amendment
(inaudible)
i
would
not
--
i'd
rather
not
attend
to
it.
mr.
william
j.
butler
but
getting
back
to
your
original
question,
i
do
make
a
dis
--
distinction
between
saying
a
prayer
in
the
halls
of
--
an
invocation
of
"god
save
this
honorable
court"
or
"in
god
we
trust"
or
so
many
other
illustrations
of
our
national
background
that
take
place
on
our
sight.
here,
there
are
two
distinct
differences.
one
is,
of
course,
that
the
public
school
system
is
compulsory
that
every
--
every
child
is
obligated
to
go
to
school.
second
is
of
course
that's
teaching.
its
vowed
environment
which
it
says,
a
teaching
environment
and
when
it's
participated
in
by
--
directly
by
state
officials,
i
think
that
makes
no
doubt
in
my
mind
and
i
hope
in
yours
that
this
is
an
activity
prohibited
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
j.
butler
was
this
be
said
allowed?
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
i
--
i
think
the
argument
was
made
in
mccollum
that
all
--
all
mccollum
was
--
was
letting
each
one
go
to
their
own
religious
instruction
and
assert
their
own
beliefs.
and
this
--
and
this
court
held
in
a
very
strong
opinion
eight
to
one
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
use
of
the
public
school
itself,
the
physical
use
of
the
public
school
to
aid
all
religions,
to
aid
all
sectarian
religions
even
though
the
non-believer
would
--
didn't
have
to
go
was
an
illegal
use
of
state
property
under
first
amendment,
mr.
justice
reed
only
dissenting.
mr.
william
j.
butler
thank
you,
mr.
justice
black.
i
agree
with
(inaudible)
learned
justice.
on
the
free
exercise
side,
we
submit
to
the
court,
isn't
this
really
compulsion?
would
the
little
child
or
would
johnny
leave
the
classroom
or
would
the
parent
be
expected
to
ask
the
school
system
to
excuse
his
child
or
who
maybe
singled
out
as
a
nonconformance.
and
i
must
adapt
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
thesis
in
--
in
mccollum
that
the
law
of
limitation
applies.
little
children
want
to
be
with
other
little
children.
very
few
parents,
if
any,
would
want
to
excuse
their
children
from
this
kind
of
an
activity
which
it
must
be
remembered
as
accepted
in
the
large
majority
by
the
community
which
it
set.
the
effect
would
be
to
cast
upon
this
child's
mind
some
indelible
mark.
and
i
think
that
they
can
be
--
can
be
sustained
that
in
effect,
the
children
are
coerced
in
the
saying
of
this
prayer
because
of
these
reasons.
i'd
like
to
bring
up
a
case
which
is
not
in
point
but
which
i
think
has
a
judicial
philosophy
that
maybe
important
here.
that's
brown
against
the
board
of
education.
brown
against
the
board
of
education
has
as
its
nemesis
or
as
core
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
to
separate
children
from
one
another
solely
because
of
their
color,
solely
because
of
their
color,
may
leave
an
indelible
mark
upon
that
child
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
it
was
suggested
by
this
court
that
such
discrimination,
such
separation
would
not
be
permitted.
isn't
the
same
judicial
philosophy
present
in
this
case?
aren't
we
in
effect
saying
that
if
a
child
can
be
excused
from
school
voluntarily,
we're
taking
that
child
out
of
an
environment?
isn't
that
a
--
isn't
solely
because
of
a
religious
belief
because
he
doesn't
believe
in
the
way
the
prayer
is
being
said
or
he
believes
he
should
pray
in
another
way
or
he
believes
he
should
wear
a
yamaka
or
it
believes
that
he
should
take
some
other
form
--
traditional
prayer.
isn't
that
an
unfair
separation
which
in
effect
could
leave
an
indelible
mark
on
his
mind
because
of
his
religious
belief?
now,
i
would
like
to,
for
a
few
moments,
address
myself
to
the
arguments
of
my
friends.
my
friends
made
three
major
arguments.
their
first
argument
is
that
this
case
falls
within
the
zorach
doctrine.
they
cease
upon
mr.
justice
douglas'
statement
that
we
are
a
religious
nation
whose
institutions
presuppose
a
supreme
being.
and
that
the
state
may
act
to
accommodate
religion,
that
the
state
should
not
be
antagonistic
towards
religion
and
that
the
duty
of
the
state
under
certain
circumstances
is
to
promote
or
to
safeguard
the
religious
heritage
of
our
nation.
i
say
that
this
prayer
really
is
only
an
accommodation
to
religion
and
it's
not
only
permissive
but
it's
the
obligation
of
the
state
to
preserve
our
heritage.
we
say
of
course
that
this
case
does
not
apply.
many
distinguishing
factors
occur,
one
of
course
is
that
in
zorach,
this
court
specifically
sustained
or
reaffirmed
the
mccollum
doctrine
and
the
activity
there
was
outside
of
the
school
system,
not
within
the
school
system.
there
was
no
direct
participation
by
the
state
in
the
religious
activity
complained
of
in
zorach
as
it
was
in
the
mccollum
case.
and
we
also
say
that
zorach,
although
stating
that
the
state
can
cooperate
in
certain
areas
with
religion,
cannot
be
construed
the
whole
that
it
would
condone
a
religious
activity
of
the
state
where
the
state
itself
composes
its
own
prayer
and
then
it's
instituted
--
instituted
in
our
compulsory
institutions.
second
argument
my
friends
made
is
the
argument
raised
earlier
by
or
suggested
earlier
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
barnette
against
the
board
of
education.
they
say
that
this
court
should
follow
barnette
because
in
barnette,
the
pledge
of
allegiance
was
not
stricken
down.
only
the
voluntariness
of
the
jehovah's
witnesses
was
sustained.
in
other
words,
they
say
that
here,
the
prayer
should
be
said
and
if
--
or
as
long
as
the
children
are
excused
from
saying
it.
of
course,
the
prime
distinguishing
fact
between
that
case
and
our
case
is
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
one
is
the
--
an
act
of
allegiance
or
a
political
faith
and
the
other
is
an
act
of
religion.
one
is
barred
by
the
constitution,
we
suggest,
the
other
is
not
so
barred.
third
argument
that
my
friends
made
is
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
in
the
minority,
that
they
do
not
represent
a
cross
section
of
the
community.
they
boldly
argue
that
the
majority
should
control
in
this
particular
instance,
and
if
this
is
a
case
where
the
minority
is
imposing
its
views
upon
the
majority,
of
course,
our
answer
to
that
is
simple.
we
say
that
the
constitution,
the
very
purpose
of
the
constitution
is
to
protect
the
minority
against
the
majority.
it's
to
protect
the
weak
against
the
strong
in
matters
of
keeping
separate
forever
the
functions
of
the
civil
and
the
religious.
finally,
they
make
the
argument
that
we
do
not
object
only
to
the
prayer
but
that
we
object
to
god
in
general
in
public
institutions,
an
argument
which
i
cannot
accept
nor
can
i
let
go
without
answering
before
this
court.
my
clients,
four
out
of
five
are
deeply
religious
people.
they
come
here
not
as
antagonist
to
religion.
they
come
here
not
to
destroy
religion
but
in
the
hope
that
they
can
persuade
this
court
and
its
long
traditions
from
the
virginia
bill
of
religious
liberty
form
madison's
remonstrance
down
through
the
times
that
it's
best
not
to
confound
the
civil
with
religious.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
and
also
as
to
the
non-believer,
of
course,
we
take
the
basic
position
that
the
rights
of
a
non-believer
are
as
important
in
the
constitutional
history
as
the
rights
of
the
believer.
a
state
can
no
more
prefer
one
religion
as
against
another
but
it
can't
compel
one
to
believe
or
not
to
believe.
this
is
our
prayer
unlike
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
it's
not
in
the
record
mr.
justice
stewart
but
i
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
it
is
not,
except
that
it
does
say
that
generally,
that
the
saying
of
the
prayer
and
the
manner
in
which
it's
said
offends
some
religious
beliefs
of
the
jew,
the
ethical
culturist
and
the
unitarian.
but
it
doesn't
go
any
further
than
that,
we
asked
for
a
trial
to
develop
the
facts
but
of
course
that
trial
was
denied.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
no,
that
isn't
what
i
mean
at
all
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
j.
butler
one
of
our
clients
is
an
ethical
culturist.
mr.
william
j.
butler
one
of
the
four
is
an
ethical
culturist.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
five
in
all.
mr.
william
j.
butler
right.
now,
that
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
--
the
other
--
the
other
three,
one
is
an
agnostic
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
right.
then
an
agnostic
does
not
believe
in
god.
mr.
william
j.
butler
and
then
there
are
two
of
the
jewish
faith
who,
of
course,
believe
in
god.
mr.
william
j.
butler
and
one
was
a
unitarian
who
believes
in
god.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
but
they're
--
they
think
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
it
talks
about
a
"he".
it
says
a
"him".
mr.
william
j.
butler
and
also
it
refers
to
"thy"
and
to
"thee".
mr.
william
j.
butler
of
course,
in
the
jewish
religion,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
that's
correct.
also,
the
jewish
religion,
mr.
justice
stewart,
doesn't
necessarily
believe
in
a
"he".
it
believes
that
god
is
coming.
now,
what
form
that
god
is
going
to
take
may
be
a
different
matter.
mr.
william
j.
butler
oh,
yes,
yes.
of
course
they,
do
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
first
of
all,
you
have
accepted
--
you've
heard
my
establishment
argument.
now,
they
have
a
standing
even
if
its
not
objectionable
to
them
to
say
that
in
the
long
run,
this
is
a
--
not
a
proper
function
of
the
state
because
it
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
their
reasons
could
be
projected
reasons
as
to
the
effect
of
religious
prayer
by
the
public,
by
the
state
on
their
own
religions
over
long
periods
of
time.
now,
in
the
free
exercise
side
of
the
religion,
they
object
for
instance
to
the
manner
in
which
it
said.
orthodox
used,
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
pray
only
in
the
synagogue.
what's
more?
they
pray
only
with
yamakas
on.
and
once
more,
they
pray
some
of
them
facing
east.
the
manner
in
which
it
said,
the
type
of
the
prayer
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
it's
in
the
record.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
--
second
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
of
course.
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
it's
also
in
english
and
the
jews
only
believe
you
should
pray
in
hebrew.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
i
think
that
a
catholic
--
i
think
that
could
be
a
secondary
objection
on
the
part
of
the
catholic
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
--
of
this
prayer.
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
i
have
no
objection
to
it,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
that's
an
affirmation
of
a
political
utterance
and
not
a
religious
utterance.
mr.
william
j.
butler
right.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
--
the
difference
i
--
i
respectfully
submit
is
that
the
general
purpose
and
the
general
word
and
the
general
reason
for
the
salute
to
the
flag
is
a
--
an
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
mr.
william
j.
butler
it's
under
god,
yes.
but
it's
a
political
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
it's
a
politic
--
under
god,
yes.
it's
a
political
affirmation.
the
whole
tenor
of
the
--
of
the
utterance
is
not
religious
whereas
the
utterance
in
this
particular
case
is
solely
religious.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
that's
correct
--
well
that's
not
a
--
if
not
--
dependence
upon
a
god,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes.
mr.
william
j.
butler
one
is
a
affirmation
of
allegiance
to
a
country
and
the
other
is
a
--
act
of
political
--
of
religious
faith?
mr.
william
j.
butler
maybe
i
can
answer
it
better
mr.
--
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
william
j.
butler
that's
correct,
yes.
the
words
under
god
were
not
included.
but
i
don't
think
i
sub
--
i
respectfully
submit
mr.
justice
stewart
that
that
is
not
--
that
does
not
change
the
phase
of
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
william
j.
butler
i
don't
think
it
has
any
bearing
on
it
because
i
don't
think
that
the
salute
to
the
flag
is
an
attempt
by
the
state
to
insert
into
its
compulsory
institutions
an
act
of
religion.
i
think
it's
merely
an
act
of
political
faith
in
the
country.
mr.
william
j.
butler
and
i
withdraw
that
distinction.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
it
--
if
--
if
this
court
would
be
willing
to
place
the
construction
upon
the
salute
to
the
flag
as
you
have
just
suggested
that
it
--
that
the
purpose
is
to
of
--
to
inculcate
into
the
children
a
belief
in
god
and
a
pre
--
and
the
pre
--
if
that
is
the
purpose,
then
i
would
have
to
suggest
that
there's
an
argument
of
foreign
constitutionality.
mr.
william
j.
butler
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
purpose.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
i
think
it
--
i
--
i
personally
think
--
of
course
i
can't
interpret
the
minds
of
congress
and
when
they
put
it
in
there.
i
think
it
means,
a
manifestation
of
a
--
the
christian
belief
and
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
i
think
that's
the
basic
reason
behind
it,
but
that
would
be
72
interpretations.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
before
you.
mr.
william
j.
butler
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
it
also
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
and
many
services
in
the
catholic
faith
are
in
english
language
also.
mr.
william
j.
butler
may
i
re
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
may
i
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
if
your
honor
please,
folio
44
at
page
15.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
i
see
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
make
this
distinction
and
i
think
your
honor
has
pointed
to
something
which
is
important
here.
we
don't
claim,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
prayer
is
unconstitutional.
a
prayer
in
our
opinion
cannot
be
unconstitutional.
there's
no
legal
significance,
no
legal
interpretation.
mr.
william
j.
butler
all
we
say
is
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
right.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes.
mr.
william
j.
butler
you're
going
to
the
sectarianism
of
the
prayer.
mr.
william
j.
butler
the
sectarianism
of
the
prayer.
mr.
william
j.
butler
no,
but
the
sectarianism
of
the
prayer
as
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
william
j.
butler
correct.
that's
also
true
in
our
case.
mr.
william
j.
butler
because
the
prayer
itself,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
a
theistic
prayer.
and
we
have
two
of
our
friends
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
but
non-theistic
religions.
mr.
william
j.
butler
and
this
is
an
attempt
to
put
--
to
force
down
the
throats
of
believers
in
non-atheistic
religion,
atheistic
prayer
in
the
man's
sense,
the
content
of
the
prayer's
objection
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
two.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
he
says
that
the
manner
in
which
it
said
in
the
setting
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
can't
say
that
this
--
that
the
prayer
itself
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
j.
butler
it
has
to
be
taken
in
--
in
con
--
in
the
context
in
which
adduce
by
the
state,
the
manner
which
it
said,
and
how
it's
said
in
the
whole
factual
pattern.
mr.
william
j.
butler
well,
i
say
that
our
argument
is
equally
important
for
--
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
the
prayer
is
re
--
is
religious
teaching
in
the
school
and
admitted
by
--
by
my
friends.
mr.
william
j.
butler
because
that's
not
the
teaching
of
religion.
that's
not
an
a
--
an
attempt
by
the
state
to
use
its
power
and
its
systems
and
its
great
authority
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
--
to
inculcate
into
children
the
teaching
of
religious
concepts.
mr.
william
j.
butler
that's
one
item.
that's
one
half.
the
other
half
of
course,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that,
this
is
a
religious
practice.
and
that
is
equally
barred.
mr.
william
j.
butler
under
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
this
is
a
ritual-based
prayer
said
in
a
ritual.
it's
a
practice
of
religion
in
the
state,
in
state
owned
institutions,
led
by
leader
of
the
state.
mr.
william
j.
butler
but
becau
--
in
this
particular
instance,
because
it's
a
school,
yes
--
yes.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
butler
yes,
your
honor.
it
violates
the
establishment
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
--
side
of
the
person.
mr.
william
j.
butler
it's
your
honor's
interpretation
that
that
is
a
prayer.
mr.
william
j.
butler
you
said
that
the
prayer.
mr.
william
j.
butler
you
said
that
the
prayer
which
you
said
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
right.
mr.
william
j.
butler
i
would
first
have
to
determine
in
order
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
william
j.
butler
you
mean
there's
a
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
--
there's
a
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
and
that
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
--
and
the
state
authorities
have
said
that
the
reason
why
we
think
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
--
that
you
go
into
school
to
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
--
teach
religion
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
i
would
--
i
would
have
to
say,
if
--
as
in
this
case,
the
purpose
is
to
inculcate
into
the
children
the
love
for
god,
and
to
have
a
--
the
teaching
of
religion
in
the
schools
that
i
would
have
to
say
would
be
unconstitutional
under
first
amendment.
mr.

j.
butler
no,
i
do
not
your
honor.
i
come
back
one,
to
its
teaching
religion.
and
two,
that
it
--
that
this
goes
further
than
your
hypothetical
question
and
that
it
is
a
religious
practice.
it's
an
act
of
reverence
to
a
--
to
the
god.
it's
man's
--
it's
--
it's
man's
holding
his
hands
together
in
an
act
of
prayer.
it's
a
religious
ritual,
a
religious
activity,
which
is
also
abided
by
the
first
amendment,
and
i
can't
abandon
that
argument
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
j.
butler
i
hope,
i
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
absolutely,
yes.
i
say
that
our
public
institutions
like
--
public
school
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
our
public
--
the
public
school
system
--
mr.
william
j.
butler
--
the
public
school
system
can
never
be
used
by
the
state
for
religious
purposes.
i
think
that
that
avenue
is
wisely
brought
to,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
by
men
with
great
foresight
in
an
attempt
to
protect
religious
freedom
in
the
long
run.
that
is
all.
mr.
william
j.
butler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
