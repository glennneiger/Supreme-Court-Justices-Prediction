there's
no
attack
upon
the
salute
of
the

justice

that
was

that
was
the
pledge
of
allegiance

justice

stewart

as
amended
now
officially
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
now
in
this
school
district,
does
this
to
only
of
elementary
schools?
are
we
dealing
only
with
the
case
involving
elementary
schools
or
the
high
schools
involved?
justice

stewart
high
school,
are
some
of
these
plaintiffs
parents
of
high
school
students?
justice

is
this
done
in

classroom
or
is
it
done

justice

mr.
butler,
earlier
in
your
argument,
you
started
to
say
that
each
one
of
the
plaintiffs
had
a
different
grievance
about
this
prayer
and
then
you
--
then
you
proceeded
to
say
that
they
had
one
thing
in
common
and
you
told
us
what
that
one
thing
was.
i
don't
know
if
you
are
really
telling
us
what
their
separate,
individualized
grievances
were.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
it
was
in
the
complaint.
i
thought
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
interested
in
this
point
because
you've
now
concluded
by
saying
that
of
your
five
clients
that
at
least
four
of
them
are
deeply
religious
people.
i
assume
they
believe
in
god,
do
they?
i
assume
that's
what
you
mean
by
--
in
saying
that
they're
deeply
religious.
justice
potter
stewart
they
don't
believe
in
god?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
--
i
--
let's
imply
ourselves
as
to
the
four.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
--
you
are
five
in
all?
justice
potter
stewart
one
is
an
ethical
culturist.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
how
about
the
other
four?
justice
potter
stewart
five,
take
away
one
is
--
is
four.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
believe
in
god.
justice
potter
stewart
believes
in
god.
so,
as
to
those
that
might
there
--
is
there
a
question
as
to
their
standing?
all
of
these
prayer
involves
is
the
affirmation
of
a
belief
in
god
and
dependence
upon
him.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
talk
about
a
christian
god.
it
doesn't
talk
about
a
--
certainly
and
does
--
doesn't
talk
about
a
methodist
or
an
episcopalian
or
presbyterian.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
there
are
some
christian
religions
who
believe
the
reason
which
might
--
might
possibly
take
technical
offense
at
that
and
say,
we
believe
in
eternity.
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
in
a
lot
of
archive
to
see
in
a
large
scope
this
course
but
the
people
of
the
jewish
faith
believe
in
god,
do
they
not?
jehovah?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
what
is
there
in
this
prayer
so
far
as
the
complaint
shows
and
without
getting
into
a
theological
discussion,
what
is
there
in
this
prayer
that
the
people
of
the
jewish
faith
find
objectionable?
justice
potter
stewart
because
is
--
is
there
anything
in
the
complaint
as
to
the
manner
in
which
it
said?
i
understand
the
place
that
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
been
in
a
school
and
not
a
synagogue.
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
there's
nothing
here
--
in
here
requiring
anybody
to
face
to
the
north,
south,
east
or
west.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
great
many
people
--
good
many,
the
catholic
--
roman
catholic
service
is
in
latin.
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
that
have
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
one
other
question,
how
do
you
--
as
i
understand
it,
you
have
no
objection
or
at
least
have
not
objected
to
the
--
to
the
saying
--
to
the
saying
of
the
pledge
of
allegiance
to
the
flag.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
stating
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
now
includes
in
its
language
the
expression,
"one
nation
under
god".
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
hope
they
restrain
that
and
--
and
this
affirmation
of
--
to
believe
in
god.
justice
potter
stewart
under
god?
justice
potter
stewart
under
god.
justice
potter
stewart
the
preposition
under
presupposes
and
--
and
implies
the
dependence
upon
a
supreme
being
by
this
entire
nation,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
iden
--
a
supreme
being
identified
by
the
word
"god".
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
this
prayer?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
think
you've
answered
it
because
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
oath
of
allegiance
was
differently
worded
at
the
time
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
that.
justice
potter
stewart
de
minimis
--
de
minimis,
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter

does
the

of
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
do
about
that
phrase?
i
--
that's
what
you
haven't
answered
at

to
my
--
so
i
haven't
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
do
you
suggest
that
phrase
means,
"under
god
--
one
nation
under
god"?
justice
potter
stewart
not
necessarily
christian,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
might
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
daiker
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you're
not
urging
any
question
of
standing
but
i've
taken
that
it's
something
we
haven't
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
the
petitioners.
justice
potter
stewart
five
elementary
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
junior
high
school
and
senior
high.
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
involves,
perhaps
kindergarten
but
in
any
event,
1st
through
the
12th
grade.
justice
potter
stewart
in
these
various
schools.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
school,
why
has
the
--
has
the
administration
of
these
--
of
these
separate
schools
or
the
school
board
made
provision
for
children
who
don't
want
to
recite
the
pledge
of
allegiance

justice

any

child

wish
