mr.
porter
r.
chandler
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
a
group
of
intervenor
parents
who
came
into
the
case
very
shortly
after
it
started
by
intervention,
with
the
four
rights
of
parties
under
the
new
york
civil
practice
act
as
persons
especially
and
beneficially
interested
in
upholding
the
determination
here
assailed.
my
clients,
we
have
heard
from
my
friend
about
the
views
of
some
religious
faiths,
my
clients
include
three
jewish
parents,
seven
protestant
parents
of
five
separate
denominations,
one
person
of
no
religious
affiliation
or
whatever
and
five
catholics.
when
this
case
started,
they
had
37
children
in
the
public
schools.
rather
the
reverse
of
the
diremos
situation,
on
the
last
count,
my
clients
now
have
41
children
in
the
public
schools,
so
there
is
no
question
of
mootness
here.
the
question
by
the
way
was
asked
to
my
opponent
or
asked
to
mr.
daiker
as
to
whether
there
was
any
question
about
the
standing
of
these
petitioners.
we
do
not
question
the
fact
that
any
of
them
or
that
they
are
all
taxpayers
and
they
are
all
parents.
but
the
question
of
standing
in
the
complete
absence
of
pocketbook
injury
and
the
question
withstanding
in
the
absence
of
what
we
understood
to
be
any
objection
to
the
prayer
maybe
something
else
again
but
that
these
petitioners,
like
my
clients,
are
all
taxpayers
and
parents,
it's
undisputed.
why
are
my
clients
here
at
all?
they
are
here
in
the
name
of
free
exercise
religion
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way.
they
are
here
because
they
feel
very
strongly
that
it
is
a
deprivation
of
their
children's
right
to
a
share
in
our
national
heritage
and
that
it
is
a
compulsory
rewriting
of
our
history
in
the
fashion
of
george
orwell's
1984
to
do
what
these
petitioners
are
now
seeking
to
do,
namely,
to
eliminate
all
reference
to
god
from
the
whole
fabric
of
our
public
life
and
of
our
public
educational
system.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
our
public
educational
system
which
is
an
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
--
important
part
of
out
public.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
said
tax
supported
--
tax
supported
institutions.
mr.
butler,
at
the
start
of
his
argument,
used
one
phrase
which
i
wish
to
criticize.
he
spoke
about
this
being
an
attempt
by
the
state
to
introduce
religious
practices
into
public
schools.
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort.
the
attack
here
is
from
the
other
direction.
it
is
an
attempt
to
drive
out
of
the
public
education
system
practices
which
are
long
established,
venerated
and
practiced
without
objection
throughout
the
country
from
the
very
beginning.
the
practice
of
prayer
in
the
public
schools
of
new
york,
to
be
specific,
goes
back
to
1837.
according
to
figures
cited
in
our
brief,
the
practice
of
either
a
prayer
of
some
sort
or
another
or
a
bible
reading
or
hymn
singing
or
any
two
or
three
of
them,
is
prevalent
throughout
the
public
schools
of
at
least
half
the
states
of
the
union.
and
as
mr.
daiker
observed,
19
attorneys
general
have
come
in
here
with
an
amicus
brief
pointing
out
the
widely
precautions
which
would
be
affected
if
my
friend's
position
were
to
be
adopted
as
the
law.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes,
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
--
there
--
there
is
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
there
is
some
reference
to
it.
i
was
speaking
to
schools
of
new
york
state,
new
york
city.
i
know
--
here's
what
--
here's
what
is
done
in
new
york
city
right
now,
your
honor.
as
an
opening
exercise,
a
religious
exercise,
if
you
will,
everyday
in
every
public
school
in
new
york
city,
they
sing
the
last
stanza
of
america,
which
is
a
prayer
and
is
intended
and
sung
as
such.
in
other
sections
of
the
state,
there
are
different
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
last
stanza,
"our
fathers"
god
to
thee,
author
of
liberty,
to
thee
we
sing.
long
may
our
land
be
bright,
with
freedom's
holy
light.
protect
us
by
thy
might,
great
god,
our
king".
that
is
as
religious
in
exercise
and
as
much
of
a
prayer
as
anything
here
involved
and
that
is
the
practice
in
all
the
public
schools
in
new
york
city.
the
basic
question
here
is
whether
these
petitioners
have
the
right
to
impose
their
views
on
everyone
else
in
the
absence
of
any
pocketbook
injury
to
them,
in
the
absence
of
any
compulsion.
i
want
to
answer
further
that
mr.
daiker
did
and
very
squarely,
the
chief
justice's
question.
there
has
been
any
question
in
this
case
of
any
compulsion
from
the
start.
the
first
resolution
recited
that
the
prayer
should
be
given
in
the
schools
contemporaneous
instructions,
and
the
record
is
perfectly
clear,
contemporaneous
instructions
from
the
start
to
all
teachers
were
that
if
any
child
objected
he
should
be
--
his
objection
should
be
respected
and
his
objection
can
take
any
one
of
several
forms.
he
can
ask
to
be
excused
from
the
room,
which
nobody
has.
he
can
remain
silent
in
the
room,
seated.
he
can
stand
up
and
not
say
anything
so
that
there
is
no
question
particularly
of
he's
being
marked
out
as
different
and
that
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
--
practice
has
been
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
--
so
from
the
start.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
in
mr.
vitale's
--
in
mr.
vitale's
affidavit
at
page
27.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
supplemented
mr.
vitale's
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
--
supplement
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
there
was
no
resolution
of
the
board
but
that
was
the
practice.
and
there
is
no
question
that
any
--
there
is
no
claim,
no
claim
has
ever
been
made
that
any
child
in
this
district
was
coerced
or
threatened
or
disciplined
or
told,
he
would
be
disciplined
from
the
very
start.
the
board
later
adopted
specific
resolutions
in
response
to
the
special
term's
request
but
they
stated
at
the
time
that
what
they
were
doing
was
merely
confirmatory
of
their
existing
practice.
so
the
question
of
compulsion
because
i
think
mr.
butler
stated
in
his
argument,
is
out
of
this
case.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
that
i
don't
know
your
--
how
--
how
the
size
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
that's
approximately
right.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
this
is
at
the
opening
of
the
class
each
day
along
with
the
salute
to
the
flag.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
think
he
could,
yes.
yes,
he
could
be
excused
that
way,
too.
let
me
come
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
whittaker
raised
about
the
flag
salute.
the
flag
salute,
in
1954
had
the
words
"under
god"
added
to
it.
and
the
question
was
asked
whether
that
had
a
religious
connotation
or
it
was
a
religious
exercise.
and
i
say
unequivocally,
yes.
and
i
say
it
on
the
authority
of
the
house
report
which
recommended
those
words.
and
pledge
of
allegiance
is
in
almost
every
public
school
throughout
the
country.
and
this
is
why
the
words
"under
god"
are
recited
by
school
children
in
that
pledge.
this
is
what
the
house
committee
said,
"our
american
government
is
founded
on
the
concept
of
the
individuality
and
the
dignity
of
the
human
being.
underlying
this
concept
is
the
belief
that
the
human
person
is
important
because
he
was
created
by
god
and
endowed
by
him
with
certain
inalienable
rights
which
no
civil
authority
may
usurp.
the
inclusion
of
god
in
our
pledge
would
further
acknowledge
the
dependence
of
our
people
and
our
government
up
with
the
moral
directions
of
the
creator".
and
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
this
group
of
petitioners
have
the
right
to
outlaw
from
our
whole
public
educational
process
anything
which
would
suggest
an
acknowledgement
of
dependence
of
our
people
and
our
government
and
our
school
children
upon
the
moral
directions
of
the
creator.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
am
told
that
--
that
the
question
i'm
--
i
think,
subject
to
correction,
i'm
told
that
the
question
is
never
a
reason.
the
jehovah's
witnesses
haven't
pulled
down
to
that
part
of
long
island
yet
but
they
would
be.
the
board
of
regents
has
made
it
quite
plain
in
their
brief
here
that
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
in
the
state
of
new
york,
the
principals
of
the
barnette
case
are
and
always
have
been
applied
and
that
any
child
of
jehovah's
witness
who
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
any
other
child.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
and
there
is
a
case
--
there
is
a
case
now
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
where
the
very
same
arguments
that
you've
heard
at
this
bar
today
on
first
amendment
grounds
are
being
used
to
attack
those
words
"under
god"
in
the
pledge
of
allegiance
to
the
flag
so
that
perhaps
next
term
or
the
term
after,
you
will
have
that
one
before
you.
but
that
there
is
--
that
--
that
those
words
have
a
religious
concept
and
that
they
were
put
in
for
a
religious
reason,
it
seems
to
me
quite
apparent
from
the
statement
i
just
read.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
thank
you
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
pursuing
the
question
that
i
had
before
lunch
with
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
apologize
for
misnaming
mr.
--
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
on
the
barnette
case
on
the
flag
salute,
i
want
to
make
quite
plain
that
our
position
is
that
the
flag
salute
even
before
the
words
"under
god"
were
put
into
it
was
regarded
as
a
religious
right
by
the
jehovah's
witnesses
and
was
so
treated
by
this
court.
the
jehovah's
witnesses
thought
that
the
flag
salute
even
without
those
words
was
the
worship
of
graven
images
and
exposed
a
participant
to
power
of
damnation
and
if
my
friends
are
right
in
their
contention,
any
conscientious,
agnostic
or
atheist
can
object
to
the
flag
salute
in
its
present
form
and
cannot
merely
ask
to
have
it
--
have
his
child
excused
but
can
ask
to
have
it
embo
--
abolished
and
that
is
the
case
that's
now
pending
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
and
any
conscientious
jehovah's
witness
and
the
jehovah's
witnesses
are
not
unknown
in
this
court
as
litigants.
any
jehovah's
witness
could
say
that
the
flag
salute
without
those
words
should
be
abolished
for
the
whole
school
room
so
that
his
child
should
not
be
pointed
out
as
different.
and
the
jehovah's
witness
child
is
put
--
is
marked
off
as
considerably
different
because
in
the
case
of
the
flag
salute,
there
is
an
open
gesture
prescribed
and
a
child
who
doesn't
say
it
can
be
spotted
right
away.
a
child
who
doesn't
want
to
say
this
prayer
can
just
keep
silent
and
not
say
it
at
all.
i
take
one
further
step
in
our
national
heritage
and
that
is
the
words
"in
god
we
trust"
which
were
declared
to
be
our
national
motto.
i
regret
to
say
that
the
very
same
organization
which
is
publicly
announced
that
is
sponsoring
this
case
has
gone
off
record
as
saying
that
it's
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
to
have
the
words
"in
god
we
trust"
displayed
on
the
walls
of
the
public
school
where
a
child
can
read
it.
i
presume
the
same
organization
would
say
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
read
or
to
teach
these
words
from
the
constitution
of
iowa,
"we
the
people
of
the
state
of
iowa,
grateful
to
the
supreme
being
for
the
blessings
he
thereto
enjoyed
and
feeling
our
dependence
on
him
for
a
continuance
of
those
blessings."
or
this
from
new
jersey,
"we
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
jersey,
grateful
to
almighty
god
for
the
civil
and
religious
liberty
which
he
has
so
long
permitted
as
to
enjoy
and
looking
to
him
for
a
blessing
upon
our
endeavours
to
secure
and
transmit
the
same
unimpaired
to
succeeding
generations,"
or
this
from
texas,
"humbly
invoking
the
blessings
of
almighty
god."
the
plain
fact
is
that
as
this
court
has
said,
such
things
run
through
our
national
history
and
our
national
heritage
and
it
would,
in
the
view
of
the
parents
whom
i
represent,
be
a
warping
of
our
national
heritage
forcibly
to
rewrite
the
curriculum
of
every
public
school
to
extend
everything
that
slants
in
that
direction
yet
nothing
less
than
that
is
what
my
friends
are
now
asking.
i
do
not
ask
my
friends
to
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
wouldn't
go
that
far
your
honor.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
put
it
on
a
religious
context
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
--
in
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
this
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
this
--
this
is
my
position
that
it
--
it
is
part
if
our
national
heritage
to
have
this
kind
of
thing
including
the
principles
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
that
if
a
school
board
having
in
mind
local
sentiment
and
responsive
to
local
needs,
feels
that
it
is
appropriate
to
include
that
sort
of
thing
in
the
curriculum.
it
is
a
--
i
won't
say
a
destruction
but
in
an
impairment
and
infringement
of
our
children's
rights
to
share
in
what
we
regard
as
our
national
heritage
to
have
that
excluded
on
the
suit
of
petitioners
who
have
not
a
cent
of
pocket
book
injury
who
claim
that
this
prayer
is
not
particularly
objectionable
and
who
have
shown
no
compulsion
and
no
coercion
against
themselves.
we
object
to
their
dictating
to
an
unwilling
school
board
and
to
unwilling
parents
their
theory
of
national
history
and
national
heritage.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
think
it
would
--
it
would
be
a
step
in
the
direction
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
think
it
would
be
a
step
in
the
direction
of
denying
us
a
share
in
the
religious
heritage
of
the
country
which
we
feel
is
part
of
a
proper
educational
system.
that's
the
best
answer
i
can
give
(voice
overlap)
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
we
can
mandamus
the
school
board
to
compel
it
to
put
this
in.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
but
that
it
--
now
that
it's
there
and
that
in
accordance
with
long
tradition,
we
think
we
are
entitled
to
be
heard
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
request
that
it
be
abolished.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
that's
my
position.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
that's
my
position
your
honor.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
right.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
would
take
the
latter
your
honor.
i
would
say
--
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
in
that
definition
of
secular.
now
secular
in
the
sense
of
extending
any
mention
of
god
from
our
national
history
and
from
our
education
is
not
the
kind
of
secularism
that
i
think
the
first
amendment
contemplated.
i
would
take
your
honor's
second
definition
and
accept
it.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
this
case
your
honor
is
--
is
not
bad.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
my
impression
is
that
it
is.
my
impression
is
that
that's
the
claim
of
my
opponents
and
i
should
be
interested
and
relieved
if
they
were
to
say
otherwise.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
oh
i
think
--
yes.
that
(voice
overlap)
that
is
quite
true.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
well
is
it
religious
training?
i
would
ask
mr.
butler
to
recite
the
words
of
the
declaration
of
the
independence
or
to
say
that
all
men
are
created
equal
and
that
they're
endowed
by
their
creator
with
amendable
rights.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
he
would,
i
take
it,
object
to
reading
such
things
as
the
constitution
of
new
jersey
which
contain
a
definite
acknowledgement
with
dependence
on
god.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
why
would
he?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
and
for
instructing
them
in
their
national
heritage
of
which
religion
is
a
part,
not
excluding
the
school
system.
i
would
say
--i
--
i
cannot
see
any
difference
between
instructing
them
in
the
principles
in
--
involved
in
that
state
constitution
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
where
do
mohammad?
if
this
were
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
if
the
traditional
heritage
of
this
country
were
mohammadanism,
i
would
--
i
would
say
no
objection
provided
christians
were
excused
from
saying
it.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
a
mohammadan
prayer
in
a
predominantly
mohammadan
community.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
well,
the
question
that
--
that
i
would
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
question
i
would
quarrel
with
is
teaching
a
religion.
i
say
that
this
is
teaching
an
essential
part
of
our
national
heritage
and
that
--
to
that
--
to
the
extent
that
religion
is
part
of
our
national
heritage,
we've
got
to
face
that
fact.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
think
your
honor
is
posing
a
question
that
is
not
within
the
bounds
of
facts
as
they
are
now.
what
situation
would
be
if
the
tradition
and
history
of
our
country
were
different
from
what
it
is,
would
be
something
else
again.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
grateful
to
almighty
god
for
our
liberties.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
not
exactly
the
same.
it's
exactly
the
same
as
if
this
prayer
read,
"almighty
god
we
are
grateful
to
you
for
our
liberties."
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
which
is
what
the
constitution
says
and
if
by
a
change
of
grammar,
that
prayer
were
recited
getting
to
school,
we
would
have
precisely
this
case.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
constitution
of
1896
and
copied
from
the
constitutions
as
far
back,
i
know
it's
1826.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
almost
the
same.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
thank
you
your
honor.
