justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
butler.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
like
to
know
exactly
what
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
what
decision
it
is
against
which
you're
seeking
review
--
from
which
you're
seeking
review
here
and
not
all
the
record,
the
board
of
regents
never
disseminated
in
issuing
something.
we're
not
here
reviewing
what
the
board
of
regents
desired
with,
you're
reviewing
some
specific
act
by
some
specific
board
of
education,
now
what
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
reading
the
prayer
which
specifically
required
to
be
read?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
also
read
the
reasons
for
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
only
interested
but
if
that's
the
vital
issue
in
this
case
whether
this
prayer
maybe
ordered
to
be
read,
isn't
that
the
real
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
reasons,
a
prayer
may
--
an
order
of
the
board
of
education
maybe
constitutionally
required
by
the
state
of
new
york
although
reasons
given
for
it
may
not
commend
themselves
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
it
will
be
more
strict
to
the
legal
principle
in
this
case
because
that's
our
business,
the
better
for
everybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
providing
for
the
same,
i
think
it
had
referred
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
adoption
of
the
prayer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
provide
for
a
recommendation.
you
can
provide
for
a
prayer
but
ordinary
english
doesn't
provide
for
a
recommendation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
going
to
refer
that
without
the
reasons
given
by
the
board,
that
prayer
by
itself
would
not
seem
to
you
to
be
offensive
to
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
why
do
we
have
this
controversy
as
to
whether
they
did
or
didn't
when
the
record
isn't
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
didn't
--
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
didn't
mean
to
shut
you
off
from
stating
anything
you
want
but
i
don't
want
things
to
be
mixed
up
with
the
difference
and
if
the
board
adopted
the
statement
of
the
board
of
ed
--
of
the
regents,
that's
one
thing,
but
if
it
didn't
adopt
it
that's
another
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
any
such
request
made?
i
mean
does
the
record
show
anything?
after
all
you
made
up
the
record,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
petitioner
is
a
parent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
the
petitioners
here
are
parents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
do
they
state
as
their
grievance
that
they
--
that
they
didn't
want
to
make
request
or
that
--
that's
the
form
of
compulsion
upon
them
to
make
a
request?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
their
exact
grievance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
stated
in
the
complaint,
not
outside
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
you
may
assume
i
remember
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
parents
say
they
don't
want
their
children
to
participate
in
this
or
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
terribly
important
that
it
was
stated
there.
they
don't
say
we
uphold
this
but
we
think
you
have
no
business
to
do
this,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
is
exactly
the
grievance
of
these
plaintiffs
below.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
having
a
hard
time
trying
to
find
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
appear
in
the
record?
i'm
probably
doing
a
man
on
this
court
who
went
through
the
new
york
public
schools
and
we
used
to
salute
the
flag
in
--
in
the
assembly,
does
it
appear
that
there
was
an
assembly
in
the
school?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
asking
what
is
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
appear?
there's
a
general
assembly
room
in
this
school
where
the
school
is
gathered
collectively
for
all
sorts
of
exercise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
not
appear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
persuade
me
that
this
is
a
form
of
teaching,
would
that
end
the
problem
for
me?
why
do
you
admit
that
it
all
turns
on
whether
this
is
teaching
was
--
was
the
flag
salute
difficulty,
one
that
it
was
objectionable
or
coerced
teaching,
was
that
the
difficulty
or
was
it
the
difficulty
that
avowal
of
faith
was
sought
to
be
coerced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
have
to
go
--
do
we
have
to
decide
that
this
is
teaching
in
order
to
decide
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
you
answered
that
it
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
could
have
endless
discussion
whether
you
show
the
avowal
of
faith
into
epigonal
called
teaching
or
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
teaching?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
raises
--
that
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
very
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
instead
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
instead
of
reading
--
reading
any
version
of
--
the
version
of
any
one
of
the
bible,
is
the
provision
for
five-minute
silence
does
silent
adaptation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
silence
for
purposes
of
meditation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wouldn't
bother.
that
would
not
bother
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
haven't
given
any,
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
haven't
decided
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not,
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
not
decided
whether
compulsory
prayer
in
the
halls
of
congress
is
constitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
be,
it
could
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
why
you
escape
--
why
you
seek
to
avoid
it.
it
could
be
if
some
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
object
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
the
pre
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
had
a
flag
salute
--
we've
had
two
flag-salute
cases
before
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fla
--
the
validity
of
the
flag
salute
in
the
new
york
schools
now
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this
question,
before
justice
stewart's
question.
i
hastily
tried
to
read
the
petition.
does
the
petition
anywhere
allege
that
any
of
your
five
objectors,
i
mean
your
five
present
petitioners
object
to
the
content
of
this
prayer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
find
lots
of
allegations
about
objecting
to
the
saying
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
specific
question
is,
well,
it
takes
faith,
you
said
the
--
the
jewish
faith
of
some
jews,
their
prayers
must
be
said
collectively
only
in
a
synagogue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
say
that
petitioner
steven
i.
engel
is
an
orthodox
jew,
he
says
he's
a
member
of
the
jewish
faith.
and
i
don't
suppose
you
deny
that
many
services
in
many
synagogues
throughout
this
country
are
entirely
in
the
english
language.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
one
of
the
controversial
questions
in
that
--
in
reading
lately
in
regard
to
what
the
pope
will
allow
and
won't
allow.
but
as
to
steven
i.
engel,
it
doesn't
say
that
he
defend
his
religious
convictions
or
beliefs
that
this
collective
prayer
is
said
in
a
classroom
rather
in
a
synagogue.
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
is
an
allegation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
content,
namely
the
meaning,
not
the
saying
of
it,
the
meaning.
i'm
not
saying
it
is
and
i
just
like
to
refer
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
folio
44.
the
saying
of
that
prayer
and
the
manner
and
setting
in
which
it
is
said,
constitutes
the
teaching
of
religion.
i
believe
in
this
--
this
content
of
religion
and
religious
practices
of
a
substantial
number
of
other
parents.
now,
if
i
--
if
i
--
unless
that
--
unless
i
have
your
guidance
to
the
contrary,
the
saying
and
the
manner
and
setting
in
which
it
is
said,
constitutes
the
teaching
of
religion.
i
want
to
know
if
anywhere
there's
any
kind
of
clear
statement
who
of
your
petitioners
is
or
are
offended
by
the
--
by
the
--
what
is
said,
not
the
fact
that
it
is
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
going
to
interrupt
the
whole
--
not
the
whole,
but
the
basic
problem
with
reference
to
the
reading
of
the
bible,
the
question
of
justice
harlan,
asked
you
about
terms
on
the
fact
that
to
--
one
of
the
important
of
the
major
religious
beliefs
in
this
country
reject
the
king
james
version,
and
therefore
to
subject
children,
i'm
not
expressing
an
opinion
on
that,
i'm
just
stating
what
the
view
is,
and
therefore,
to
subject
children
to
the
reading
of
the
king
james
version,
new
english
--
"the
new
english
testament"
is
subjecting
them
to
--
to
religious
utterances
contrary
to
their
faith
because
they
have
a
different
authorized
version,
namely
"the
catholic
bible."
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
--
so
that
there
is
a
diff
--
there
is
an
objection
to
the
bible
cases
to
the
content
of
what
it
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
my
knowledge,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
--
i'm
now
asking
you
whether
there's
any
such
allegation
in
this
petition,
i'm
not
even
saying
that
that's
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
haven't
said
it
was
sectarian.
all
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
sectarianism,
but
difference.
we're
not
choosing
here
between
different
religious
beliefs.
but
the
point
of
the
catholic
parents
in
the
--
in
the
bible
controversy
is
this,
that
their
children
--
their
authoritative
ecclesiastically
or
days
official,
if
i
may
use
that
adjective,
bible
is
a
douay
not
the
king
james
version,
how
ever
beautiful
that
may
be.
and
therefore,
you
make
catholic
children
listen
to
formulations
that
they
reject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
point
that
out
in
the
--
in
the
petition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
jew
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
engel
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
of
your
petitioners
are
nontheist?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
then
you
can
speak
for
those
two,
but
mr.
engel
has
been
in
that
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
manner
isn't
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
--
what
you're
saying,
mr.
butler,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
if
there
were
schools
in
which
concededly
every
member
of
the
school
was
a
--
was
a
communicant
of
the
episcopal
protestant
church
and
the
lord's
prayer,
as
sanctioned
by
that
church,
are
required
to
be
uttered
at
a
morning
assembly
a
devout
episcopal
--
episcopalian
parent
could
object
to
having
that
prayer
said.
you
would
have
legal
standings
and
objectives.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
it
precisely
the
prayer
that
is
uttered
in
the
petition
of
that
petitioner's
church
every
sunday
morning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
you
get
down
to
a
real
legal
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
your
conclusion,
it
is
your
ultimate
position
that
our
public
schools
--
i'm
going
to
ask
you
a
question
that
requires
some
candor
on
your
part,
and
i
can
see
that's
the
duty
of
lawyers
to
have
candor
about
their
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
is
it
your
position
that
our
public
schools,
by
virtue
of
our
constitutions,
are
frankly
secular
institutions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
public
institutions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
said
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
interrupt
to
ask
whether
your
answer
to
chief
justice
that
if
there
were
compulsion,
you
would
find
this
offensive
in
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
to
infer
that
that
implies
that
the
unobjectionability
of
the
contents
of
the
required
prayer
doesn't
settle
the
matter?
to
your
fact,
that
--
that
the
prayer,
nearly
expressive
what
you
argue,
is
the
common
presupposition
of
our
national
life
doesn't
say
that
--
say
that's
constitutionality
if
added
thereto
is
a
compulsion
to
express
that
common
faith
of
the
nation
that
you
argue,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
we
have
to
go
beyond
merely
whether
the
content
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
offend
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
--
what
i
ask
you
--
what
i
asked
your
brother
butler,
namely,
in
order
to
object
what
you
say
would
be
beyond
the
call
of
the
state
to
impose,
namely
to
compel
participations
in
such
a
prayer,
the
parent
wouldn't
have
to
say,
"i
object
to
what
prayer
can
obtain
but
i
merely
object
to
having
my
child
being
subjected
to
it
even
though
i
believe
in
that
prayer",
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
would
you
--
would
you
have
to
have
a
parent
who
--
who
also
find
offensive
at
the
bad
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
who
doesn't
believe
in
the
content
of
the
prayer.
could
any
parent
say,
"i
don't
want
my
child
forcibly
be
required
to
say
that
prayer,
although
i
think
it's
an
admirable
prayer
and
it
expresses
my
faith"?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
from
your
point
of
view
--
from
your
point
of
view,
the
case
merely
gets
down
to
your
point
of
view
to
the
narrow
question
or
at
least
delimited
question
whether
the
circumstances
under
which
this
prayer
was
administered
if
you
can
administer
a
prayer
or
would
be
cited
by
the
teacher
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
unison
--
for
--
for
the
congregation
for
the
class
will
be
joined
whether
those
circumstances
differentiated
from
a
frank
requirement
that
they
cited?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
frank
compulsion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
case
gets
down
to
prove.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
fairly
summarize
--
do
i
fairly
understand
the
line
of
your
position
in
the
course
of
the
colloquy
we've
had
in
a
few
minutes,
that
you
--
you
say
it
isn't
teaching
religion
to
take
for
granted
that
which
underlies
our
whole
national
life
as
indicated
in
zorach,
is
that
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
charac
--
you
don't
promote
something
that
you'd
take
for
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
promote
the
air
which
you
breathe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
daiker.
may
i
--
before
you
sit
down,
in
interest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
on
mr.
chandler's
time.
we
have
here
a
prayer
of
public
schools
for
children
between
the
ages
of
what
and
what,
kindergarten
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
18?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
recall
to
you
the
will
of
stephen
girard,
who
was
a
devout
catholic
and
founded
girard
college
for
the
orphans
of
philadelphia
and
in
his
will,
there
was
a
provision
set
forth
at
length
prohibiting
that
no
enthusiastic
of
any
kind
of
faith
could
set
forth
on
the
ground
of
girard
college
for
any
considerable
grounds.
and
he
gave
the
reasons
for
it.
the
children
there,
the
young
people
there
or
aptly
boys
up
to
the
age
of
18
because
he
thought
up
to
--
during
that
period
of
youth
under
holds
that
prayer
except
to
the
people,
faith,
religious
devotions,
are
not
critically
self-determined.
and
he
gave
reasons
why.
therefore,
he
didn't
want
any
religious
influence
he
brought
the
best
upon
the
attendants,
the
students
of
girard
college.
and
you
will
remember
that
that
will
was
contested
on
the
ground
that
such
a
provision
of
will
is
against
public
policy
for
the
reasons
that
you
--
in
your
own
language
indicated
that
you're
essentially
religious
people
and
that
litigation
came
to
this
court
more
than
once.
now,
what
i
want
to
ask
you
in
the
light
of
that
rather
famous
historic
episode,
what
do
you
think
a
line
of
that
sort
very
important?
remember
that
girard
is
a
catholic
communicating
(inaudible)
communicating
for
the
catholic
church,
buried
in
catholic
burial
ground
et
cetera,
what
do
you
think
the
line
--
there
is
a
difference
between
what
you
do
with
reference
to
children
or
boys
up
to
18
certainly
receiving
girard's
(inaudible)
into
the
children?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
there
is
a
--
a
constitutional
difference
may
be
drawn
with
reference
to
the
particular
case
we
have
before
us,
namely,
the
requirement
of
this
kind
of
a
prayer
subject
to
--
to
taking
steps
to
have
children,
a
child
taking
out
and
not
consenting
or
drawing
the
line
up
to
the
age
of
18,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
unfortunately
--
if
you'll
forgive
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
really
is
his
opinion
because
the
--
the
enforceability
by
the
law
of
his
opinion
because
that
will
was
contested
as
being
against
public
policy.
and
he
--
he
said
that
nobody
can
go
there
without
taking
an
oath,
you'll
never
marry
again,
you'll
never
marry,
that
was
not,
i
assume,
that
would
have
been
deemed
the
provision
against
public
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
it
affirmatively.
he
said
what
he
thought
to
--
when
it
came
of
age
--
at
18
then
the
child
could
make
his
own
decision.
a
human
being
can
make
his
own
decisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
chandler
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
it
there
in
your
brief
a
reference
to
the
history
of
prayers
in
new
york
public
schools
as
i
--
i've
already
indicated
i'm
a
product
of
them,
and
they
still
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
still
have
flag
salute,
i
remembered
vividly
but
--
but
i
think
i'm
quite
clear
that
in
my
days,
in
my
public
schools,
(inaudible)
prayer,
i'm
not
saying
that
that
isn't
elsewhere
but
i'm
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
classes
are
about
between
30
and
40
is
the
size
time
of
the
class?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
reject
them
--
you
reject
the
suggestion
that
the
school
system
of
minor
children
must
be
kept
on
a
wholly
secular
basis
or
do
you
say
that
--
that
it
is
secular
basis
in
any
valid
sense
if
it
also
takes
for
granted
if
there's
a
religious
foundation
to
our
nation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
of
course
this
case
isn't
quite
--
the
issue
in
this
case
isn't
quite
the
name
of
the
--
the
appellation
of
god
or
the
invocation
of
god
must
never
be
allowed
to
be
made
in
a
school
--
in
a
public
--
in
a
--
in
a
public
school.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
bad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question
before
you
sit
down
mr.
chandler.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
preamble
of
new
york
constitution
makes
reference
to
almighty
god.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
the
problem
immediately
before
the
recitation
of
this
prayer
in
circumstances
in
which
it
is
made,
in
the
school
in
which
it
is
being
carried
on,
raises
precisely
the
same
question
as
though
in
the
classes,
whatever
they
call
it,
government,
current
affairs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
teacher
thought
it
desirable
to
read
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
including
this
preamble.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
the
prayer
to
align
it
to
the
words
that
the
preamble
of
new
york
constitution
(inaudible)
whatever
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
say
that
in
a
class
on
the
government
of
political
science
into
whatever
the
appropriate
label
would
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
dealing
with
the
new
york
constitution
that
to
read
that
the
whole
constitution
for
that
purpose
in
those
circumstances
would
raise
the
same
questions
or
rather
the
probable
case
immediately
before
us,
raise
the
same
question
as
my
hypothetical
case.
