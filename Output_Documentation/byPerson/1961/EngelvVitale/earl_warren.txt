chief

(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
school
board
said
that
it
adopted
the
prayer
for
the
reasons
that
the
board
of
regents
had
--
had
sent
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
for
the
reason
stated
by
the
board
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
can't
we
have
it
heard
if
it's
a
part
of
the
background
of
the
things?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
argue
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
mr.
butler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
daiker.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
neidlinger
or
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
daiker,
i
wonder
if
it
will
--
if
there
would
be
any
difference
in
your
mind
if
instead
of
our
marshal
saying,
"god
bless
this
honorable
court"?
if
we
were
to
require
every
litigant
and
every
lawyer
who
comes
into
this
court
before
he
receives
any
recognition
from
this
court
to
deliver
the
prayer
that
your
children
in
the
schools
have
delivered.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
wonder.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
was
compelled
--
required
of
all
student,
would
it
be
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
was
compulsion
or
you
concede
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
earl
warren
religious
faith?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
(voice
overlap)
no
that's
not
semantics.
i
think
that
we
talk
about
faith
as
a
religious
or
faith
in
our
country
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
that's
--
that's
different
from
religion,
isn't
it?
whether
a
person
belongs
to
a
sect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
a
person
who
belongs
to
no
--
no
churches
of
any
kind
offers
a
prayer
to
--
to
god,
it's
a
--
it's
a
religious
devotion,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
religious
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
in
that
sense,
wouldn't
this
be
the
said
prayer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
may
i
ask
you
this
question
mr.
daiker,
will
you
tell
us
please
in
your
words
why
or
--
or
what
the
reasons
were
for
having
this
prayer
as
--
as
shown
by
the
--
for
the
regents
or
for
by
the
school
board
or
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
what
it
proves
to
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
shy
away
from
the
--
the
word
"religion".
was
it
--
was
it
the
purpose
of
the
board
to
promote
religion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
say
ethical
--
ethical
purposes
and
things
of
that
kind
would
shy
away
from
religion
when
--
when
the
entire
wording
of
the
--
of
the
prayer
is
in
--
in
the
words
of
religion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
you
want
to
keep
away
from
that,
but
i'm
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
i'm
--
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
how
you
analyze
the
language
of
the
board
of
regents,
the
action
of
the
board
of
regents,
the
action
of
your
school
board
and
the
--
and
the
delivering
of
this
prayer
every
morning
without
--
without
getting
a
question
of
religion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
that
the
purpose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
board
of
regents
in
--
in
promoting
that
in
the
--
in
the
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
thought
--
but
i
thought
that
was
exactly
what
the
lower
court
found
that
they
did
in
some
respect
and
that
you
concede
here
now
because
originally,
didn't
they
make
the
--
make
it
compulsory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
it
was
a
--
it
was
the
school
board
that
made
it
compulsory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
the
original
resolution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
wasn't
--
that
wasn't
done
until
after
the
court
had
determined
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
be
unconstitutional
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
be
required,
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
--
have
anything
excusing
any
child,
did
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
wasn't
any
practice
before
--
before
it
started,
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
--
what
i
meant
was
this.
in
the
original
--
in
the
original
resolution,
they
provided
that
this
--
this
prayer
should
be
administered
each
morning.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
at
that
time
provide
for
any
excuses
for
children
who
--
whose
parents
did
not
want
them
to
do.
and
it
was
not
until
your
--
to
your
supreme
court.
the
appellant
division
said
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
compel
them
to
do
it,
that
they've
been
passed
another
resolution
saying
that
of
course,
they
would
be
excused.
am
i
correct
in
that
sequence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
would
you
--
would
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
please,
yes,
i'm
--

chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
calling
on
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
calling
on
everybody
in
the
courtroom
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
--
that's
all
i
intended
to
imply.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
it
mean?
i
was
just
curious.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
resolution
that
points
that
out,
is
it
--
is
that
in
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
a
religious
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
mr.
daiker
i
--
as
i
understand
mr.
butler,
neither
he
nor
his
--
his
clients
object
to
any
such
prayers,
any
place
except
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
public
schools
where
the
children
are
compelled
to
come
and
where
they
will
be
indoctrinated
with
--
with
the
--
with
the
prayer
as
a
matter
of
--
of
training
and
where
they
will
be
held
up
to
contempt
or
ridicule
if
they
or
their
parents
should
want
them
to
be
excused
and
pointed
out
as
being
different
from
the
rest
of
the
children?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
got
pretty
involved
i
guess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
taking
as
far
as
you
--
so
far
as
you
remember.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
chandler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
where
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
was
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
resolution
of
the
board
during
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
chandler
may
i
ask
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
what
is
the
basis
of
your
client's
objection
that
it
deprives
their
children
of
the
right
to
have
religious
instruction
in
the
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you
--
you
emphasize
to
us
that
some
are
protestants,
some
are
catholics
and
some
are
jews
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
put
it
all
in
a
religious
context
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
people
had
denied
that.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
it
because
of
religion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
--
but
your
--
your
clients,
religionist
though
they
aren't,
do
not
contend
that
the
petitioner
was
to
prevail
that
this
would
deny
them
of
any
religious
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes.
i
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
questioning
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
rights
to
be
heard
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
assume
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
have
the
idea
from
listening
to
--
to
mr.
butler
that,
although
he
didn't
say
this
but
for
instance
if
the
--
if
the
word
of
god
appeared
in
some
poem
in
--
in
english
that
they
would
have
no
objection
to
--
to
that
but
that
wouldn't
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
be
the
factors
of
religion
but
he
objects
to
this
because
it's
pinpointed
at
religious
training.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
understand
him
say
that
he
would
--
he
would
not
--
not
to
object
to
--
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
