mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would,
at
the
outset,
explain
that
i
am
representing
the
board
of
education
which
adopted
the
resolution
instituting
the
regents'
prayer
as
a
part
of
the
--
the
daily
opening
exercise.
mr.
chandler
here
is
dividing
his
time
and
i'm
dividing
my
time
with
him,
he
is
representing
a
group
of
taxpayers
and
interested
parents
within
the
school
district,
having
children
now
attending
there,
who
likewise
feel
that
the
prayer
is
sound,
and
the
saying
of
it
is
not
unconstitutional.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
no,
sir.
i
would
first
of
all
correct
any
impression
that
may
have
been
left
during
mr.
justice
stewart's
inquiry
as
to
what
the
prayer
says
because
we
heard
that
it
included
the
words
"he"
and
"him".
and
for
clarity,
we
should
again
refer
to
it
as
reading.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
standing
as
to
the
petitioners
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
--
and
the
individual
respondents.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
there
has
been
no
question
raised
about
that
for
you
to
decide
your
honor.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
no,
sir.
the
petitioners
at
the
outset
of
this
proceeding
have
--
have
children
in
school
and
now
do.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
and
are
taxpayers.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
well
then
of
course,
we
would
get
into
diremos
in
the
question
of
pocketbook
injury.
i
doubt
if
they
would
have
a
standing
to
complain
unless
under
the
decided
cases,
they
could
show
that
their
interest
was
specific.
i
think
it
has
been
said
that
where
a
person's
grievances
in
general
with
all
others,
he
has
no
standing
particularly
to
sue.
he
must
show
a
personal
effect
on
himself.
this
was
part
of
what
this
court
said
in
mcgowan.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
sir.
if
i
may,
i
would
just
repeat
this
prayer
because
of
the
use
of
the
language
that
we
had
referred
to.
"almighty
god,
we
acknowledge
our
dependence
upon
thee,
and
we
beg
thy
blessings
upon
us,
our
parents,
our
teachers
and
our
country".
and
i
--
mr.
justice
stewart
specifically
wanted
to
correct
that
impression.
the
herricks
school
district
on
long
island
consists
of
seven
schools,
five
elementary
schools,
a
junior
high
school
and
a
senior
high
school.
i
state
that
to
clarify
in
the
court's
mind
what
is
affected
here.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
five
elementary
schools.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
a
junior
high
and
a
senior
high.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
correct,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
there
are
a
total
of
slightly
an
excess
of
5400
children
attending
these
seven
schools.
this
prayer
has
been
instituted
and
been
used
down
since
1958.
at
the
time
of
the
institution
of
petitioners'
suit,
there
was
a
single
request
for
an
excuse
from
participating.
there
was
no
request
to
be
excused
from
the
classroom
and
to
this
date,
there
has
been
none.
we
have
heard
the
petitioners
say,
that
their
cas
--
case
rest
primarily
on
whether
religious
teaching
is
involved.
is
this
a
religious
teaching?
and
here
is
where
my
friend
and
i
depart
in
our
thinking.
since
the
earliest
days
of
this
country,
going
back
to
the
mayflower
compact,
the
men
who
put
the
country
together
have
publicly
and
repeatedly
recognized
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being,
a
god.
there
have
grown
in
this
country
and
in
this
world
many
branches
of
religion,
most
of
which
recognize
a
deity.
there
are
people,
however,
who
go
to
no
organized
church
and
are
not
part
of
any
particular
religion
who
likewise
believe
in
that
deity.
when
therefore,
we
say
here,
this
prayer
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
characterized
as
an
avowal
of
faith,
an
avowal
which
recognizes
that
there
is
some
supreme
power,
some
supreme
being.
we
are
proceeding
fully
in
the
court
with
the
tradition
and
heritage
which
has
been
handed
down
to
us.
we
know,
of
course,
that
in
the
declaration
of
independence,
we
have
four
references
to
the
creator,
to
the
supreme
being
who
gave
us
his
--
gave
us
our
unalienable
rights.
we
can't
rewrite
history
now.
those
words
are
emblazoned
in
that
document,
and
they
will
always
be
with
us.
our
colonies,
one
by
one
as
they
adopted
the
constitution,
recognized
the
existence
of
an
almighty
god,
a
supreme
being.
and
as
of
today
with
our
50
states,
49
out
of
the
50
so
recognize
this.
indeed,
if
the
court
in
its
review
of
the
briefs
at
a
later
date
will
examine
in
appendix
a,
we
have
collected
extracts
from
either
the
preambles
or
the
constitutions
of
49
of
our
50
states.
we
will
find
there
language
quite
comparable,
one
after
another
starting
out,
"we,
the
people
of
the
state
of
arkansas
or
new
york,
grateful
to
almighty
god
for
his
blessings
and
--
and
acknowledging
our
dependence
upon
him".
these
are
the
constitutions
which
protect
the
rights
of
the
citizens
of
the
states.
and
in
an
effort
to
arrive
at
a
prayer
which
would
continually
recognize
that
supreme
being
as
part
of
the
opening
exercises
at
our
schools,
the
words
were
lifted,
if
you
will
from
these
preambles
and
constitutions,
and
made
a
--
a
part
of
this
prayer.
so
we
go
back
again
to
saying,
"almighty
god,
we
acknowledge
our
dependence
upon
thee",
as
a
paraphrasing
of
what
appears
in
most
of
our
state
constitutions.
i
might
say
that
this
is
not
just
my
characterization
of
those
state
constitutions
either.
the
court
has
before
it
now,
a
brief
submitted
by
19
out
of
20
states
which
have
now
sought
intervention
in
this
case.
19
attorneys
general
have
said,
"we
don't
believe
that
this
violates
our
state
constitution
and
we
urge
upon
the
supreme
court
that
this
practice
continue".
the
20th
of
course
is
our
own
new
york
state
where
a
brief
has
been
filed
on
behalf
of
the
state
education
department
urging
again
that
the
prayer
be
continued
and
that
of
the
saying
of
it
not
be
held
unconstitutional.
now,
we're
not
unfamiliar
with
zorach
against
clauson
and
the
mccollum
case
and
the
everson
case.
and
we
realize
the
reliance
in
those
cases
on
the
words,
"separation
of
church
and
state".
we
recognize
also
that
--
that
in
those
cases,
the
courts
used
language
which
said,
"the
state
and
religion
need
not
be
hostile
to
each
other,
it
need
not
be
alien
and
unfriendly,
but
that
there
is
an
area
of
accommodation
which
can
be
made
between
the
state
and
religion".
and
this
was
after
reviewing
a
background
of
how
the
first
amend
--
amendment
evolved,
and
how
we
got
to
the
words
"congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion"
which
we
recognize
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
then
becomes
applicable
to
our
state
of
new
york
and
to
its
smallest
subdivisions
or
school
district.
we
recognize
that
that
first
amendment
applies
as
much
as
to
the
herricks
school
district
as
it
does
to
congress.
but
after
tracing
the
history
of
that,
many
courts
have
said,
"none
of
that
language
prohibits
a
religious
state.
it
may
well
prevent
and
prohibit
a
state
religion
but
not
in
reverse".
this
court
has
said
many
times,
"we
are
essentially
a
religious
people".
they've
repeated
that
in
zorach.
but
we
are
not
trying
here
in
the
herricks
school
district
to
teach
religion,
as
my
friend
has
characterized
it,
anymore
than
this
mr.
justice
brennan,
asked
the
question
on
the
prayer
used
in
this
court,
and
this
is
part
of
our
brief,
we
have
used
that
same
argument,
mr.
justice
brennan
in
our
brief.
suppose
the
prayer
used
in
the
herricks
school
district
were
paraphrased
to
meet
the
exact
wording
of
the
prayer
of
this
court."
god
bless
the
united
states
and
the
herricks
school
district".
does
this
make
it
a
religion?
but
now
we
get
there
onto
the
word
"semantic".
whether
or
not,
the
recognition
of
a
supreme
being
on
a
public
occasion
amounts
to
a
religion
to
an
establishment
of
religion.
we
have
seen
in
the
decided
cases,
we've
heard
comment
here
this
morning
that
whenever
a
group
of
men
get
together,
it
seems
to
be
proper
to
recognize
the
source
of
our
blessings
and
our
freedom.
even
in
our
own
herricks
school
district
when
we
opened
up
our
new
high
school.
we
had
several
faiths
represented
on
the
platform
who
asked
god's
blessing
on
the
use
of
these
schools.
is
this
a
sponsorship
by
the
herricks
school
district
of
a
religion
or
an
establishment
of
religion
or
is
this
not
once
again
recognizing
that
there
is
a
supreme
being
on
which
we
rely?
we
have
had
our
presidents
--
presidents
one
after
another
so
recognize.
president
kennedy
in
his
january
message
concluded
with
words
asking
for
god's
blessing
on
the
united
states
of
america.
this
is
something
which
comes
from
within
us,
but
which
is
engrained
in
us
from
the
time
we
are
children,
from
the
time
we
start
to
learn
that
what
rights
we
have
--
have
emanated
from
god,
a
god,
a
supreme
being.
we
are
of
varying
faiths.
we
have,
i
presume,
varying
faiths
on
this
supreme
court,
and
yet
you
find
a
common
denominator
in
the
prayer
with
which
the
court
starts.
we
note
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
administration
of
the
oath,
the
clerk
here
says,
"so
help
me
god".
and
my
friends
seriously
argue,
"this
is
a
religion
or
an
--
an
establishment
of
religion?"
we
say
no.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
daiker.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
i'd
like
to
answer
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
i
think
now,
we
come
very
close
to
our
torcaso
case,
where
we
are
now
requiring
and
i
consider
admission,
certainly
to
the
bar
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
the
nature
of
a
public
office.
we
are
now
seeking
a
religious
test
for
public
office
which
this
court,
in
torcaso
said
certainly
was
unconstitutional
brought
by
specific
provision.
i
think
you
are
now
approaching
the
word
compulsion,
and
that
has
been
used
many
times
this
morning
by
my
adversary
in
his
argument.
he
talked
about
the
compulsory
prayer
in
the
herricks
school
district
and
stated
that
until
the
time
that
this
came
before
a
special
term,
this
was
compulsory.
now,
this
didn't
tell
the
whole
story
because
from
the
moment
the
prayer
was
instituted,
there
was
no
compulsion
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
--
upon
any
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
you
have
compulsory
--
compulsory
education
but
we're
now
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
sir.
we
have
compulsion
on
both.
but
we're
now
talking
about
the
compulsion
that
the
chief
justice
was
referring
to
of
a
litigant
or
a
member
of
the
bar
appearing
in
this
court
and
being
required
in
effect
to
profess
a
belief
in
god
as
a
condition
to
appearing
here.
and
this
is
the
compulsion
i
am
now
seeking
to
address
my
remarks
to.
it
appears
in
the
affidavit
of
william
j.
vitale
on,
if
you
have
that
though,
page
27.
neither
the
board
of
education
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
page
27,
folio
79,
on
the
contrary,
the
principals
and
teachers
in
the
school
district
have
been
directed
and
are
following
the
directions
that
under
no
circumstances
shall
a
pupil
in
anyway
be
made
or
encouraged
to
join
in
the
prayer
and
no
teacher
has
instructed
the
pupils
how
if
they
are
to
hold
their
hands
or
otherwise
conduct
themselves
during
the
saying
of
the
prayer.
i
would
emphasize
that
in
view
of
the
remark
that
this
was
compulsory
after
the
time
that
we
went
to
the
special
attorney
court
in
nassau
county.
this
was
an
affidavit
reciting
the
facts
as
they
existed
from
the
--
july
8,
1958,
when
the
resolution
of
the
board
of
education
not
directed
to
children
but
in
effect
spreading
upon
the
minutes
what
the
policy
of
the
board
of
education
was
to
be.
and
that's
as
far
as
it
went,
there
was
no
direction
to
the
children
and
the
parents
knew
or
most
of
the
parents
certainly
knew
if
there
were
any
question
about
it
that
through
their
principal,
they
would
find
the
principal
of
each
school
that
the
principals
had
been
directed
that
no
child
was
to
be
required
to
join
in
this
prayer
if
he
felt
it
was
against
his
religion
or
his
parent's
wishes.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
i
think
the
compulsion
would
make
the
unconstitutional
aspect
of
it
similar
to
west
virginia
against
barnette,
where
there,
we
have
the
pledge
of
--
pledge
of
allegiance,
claim
to
be
violative
of
the
individual
child's
religious
beliefs.
here,
we
find
unconstitutionality
created
by
the
compulsion.
and
this
is
what
we
think
would
happen
here
if
there
were
compulsion.
there
has
been
no
such
compulsion.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
sir.
we
feel
then
that
this
would
be
a
captive
child
as
was
the
case
in
west
virginia
against
barnette,
a
captive
child
required
to
recite
the
declaration
of
independence
against
that
child's
own
religious
beliefs.
we
recognize
this
under
the
state
education
board,
if
the
court
please,
in
connection
with
provisions
for
the
teaching
of
hygiene.
there
are
certain
religions
which
do
not
accept
the
teaching
of
highs
--
hygiene
in
public
schools.our
law
specifically
makes
an
exception
for
that.
and
i
think
that
the
members
of
the
board
of
education
were
guided
by
thinking
of
that
sort
that
this
should
not
be
compulsory.
we
have
set
forth
at
the
beginning
of
our
brief
further
regulations
which
were
adopted
as
a
result
of
special
term
suggestion
where
there
was
an
elaboration
and
a
commitment
to
writing
that
there
was
to
be
no
such
compulsion.
and
that
any
child
who
requested
could
be
excused.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
but
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
i
would
so
agree
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
correctly,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
because,
here
again,
we
must
be
guided
by
this
court's
own
decision
in
the
barnette
case.
the
flag
salute
as
such
is
not
unconstitutional.
the
prayer
here
as
such
is
not
unconstitutional
but
if
it
is
administered
with
compulsion,
then
we
have
an
unconstitutional
practice
which
the
courts
will
strike
down.
but
we
suggest
to
this
court,
not
by
borrowing
it
or
abolishing
it
any
more
than
we
abolish
the
flag
salute
after
barnette,
but
merely
permitting
those
who
do
not
find
an
accommodation
between
thi
--
this
and
their
own
religious
beliefs
to
remain
silent
or
be
excused.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
he
would
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
any
parent
could
so
state,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
they
could
state
that
without
stating
their
reasons
why.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
they
need
merely
ask,
"may
my
child
be
excused?"
or
the
child
himself
or
herself
may
so
ask.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
a
frank
re
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
compulsion?
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
right,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
the
question
revolves
itself
particularly
around
that
question
of
compulsion.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
agreed
to
the
words
"avowal
of
faith"?
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
i
would
say
yes,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
well,
now,
we
get
down
to
semantics
again,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
well,
the
reason
sir
that
i
questioned
the
--
i
questioned
what
--
drew
back
on
the
word
"religious
faith"
is
because
i
also
said
that
there
are
people
who
believe
in
a
supreme
being
without
it
being
a
particular
religion
that
that
person
may
believe
in.
but
such
a
person
could
make
an
avowal
of
faith
in
god
without
being
a
religious
person
in
the
colony
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
--
except
determined.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
we
--
we
--
we
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
--
we
think
in
terms
of
a
sect
as
a
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
i
would
agree.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
in
that
sense
i
would
agree
with
your
statement
of
--
as
to
this
being
religious
faith.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
well,
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
came
to
the
attention
of
the
board
of
education
as
a
result
of
the
recommendation
of
the
board
of
regents.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
in
1951
and
reaffirmed
in
1955.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
that
statement,
like
any
document,
if
words
are
taken
or
a
sentence
is
taken
from
here
or
there,
can
prove
almost
any
point
you
wish.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
but
basically
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
--
basically,
this
prove
to
me
that
the
board
of
regents,
and
i'm
using
some
of
their
language,
was
interested
in
promoting
the
belief
in
tradition,
the
belief
and
the
moral
and
spiritual
values
which
make
up
part
of
our
national
tradition.
now,
this
is
a
lot
of
verbiage,
i
agree,
and
if
you
gave
this
to
a
youngster,
it
wouldn't
mean
very
much.
but
i
think
to
a
board
of
education,
when
this
document
is
presented
to
them
from
the
board
of
regents,
they
read
this
but
they
make
their
own
decision.
this
was
not
compulsory
from
the
board
of
regents
to
the
board
of
education.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
bo
--
of
the
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
have
the
court
understand
my
words
as
saying
that
the
board
of
education
was
trying
to
teach
religion
in
the
schools.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
well
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
i
don't
think
you
can
stay
away
from
religion.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
so
long
as
you
have
a
prayer,
there
is
a
religious
facet
to
it.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
just
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
i
don't
believe
their
purpose
was
to
promote
religion
as
such
but
they
did
and
they
so
stated,
they
were
seeking
to
promote
a
continuation
of
what
they
felt
to
be
the
traditions
of
this
country
in
which
god
is
inevitably
mentioned
and
in
which
inevitably
every
document
and
every
pronouncement
recognizes
that
we
have,
we
got
from
god.
and
i
think
this
is
what
they
were
trying
to
enhance
and
forced
it.
they
had
no
more
desire
to
teach
religion
in
schools.
we
give
credit
to
the
board
of
regents
for
being
cognizant
whit
their
educational
department,
legal
division
of
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
certainly
they
would
not
suggest
to
boards
of
education,
individual
boards
of
education,
a
procedure
which
they
felt
was
flying
directly
in
the
face
of
cases
which
say
religion
shall
not
be
taught
in
schools,
as
we
had
in
mccollum.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
no,
sir.
this
has
never
been
com
--
this
is
what
i
tried
to
correct
to
the
opening
of
my
statement
and
may
i
reemphasize
this
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
no,
sir.
the
school
board
did
not
make
it
compulsory.
the
school
boards
said,
"we
hereby,
in
effect,
we
hereby
adapted
--"
if
you
would
look
for
that
resolution,
"we
hereby
adapt
as
a
practice
to
be
followed
in
the
schools
each
day,
joined
with
the
pledge
to
flag,
the
saying
of
the
regents'
prayer".
but
the
--
there,
the
resolution
of
the
school
board
ended.
there
was
no
compulsion
at
--
it
did
not
go
on
and
say,
"and
in
addition,
every
child
who
attends
schools
in
the
herricks
school
district
shall
be
required
to
join
in
this
prayer".
but
on
the
contrary,
as
i
have
referred
to
the
affidavit
of
the
president
of
the
board
at
the
time
the
suit
was
instituted,
this
was
directly
contrary
to
what
was
in
fact
the
case.
the
--
the
principals
were
directed
that
no
child
was
to
be
required
to
join
in
this
prayer.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
it
was
not
in
the
resolution,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
that
is
correct.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
but
the
origi
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
--
the
original
resolution
had
no
compulsion
in
it.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
it
said
this
is
our
policy.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
but
that
was
the
practice.
it
was
the
practice
as
much
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
well,
at
that
point,
yes,
there
was
a
practice
at
least
to
establish
by
one
child
who
had
asked
to
be
excused
from
joining
in
the
prayer
and
that
request
had
been
honored.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
the
sequence
is
correct,
sir,
but
your
characterization
of
the
first
resolution
is
incorrect
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
--
if
i
may
suggest
that.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
may
i
--
may
i
just
read
the
first
resolution?
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
this
is
how
it
moved,
seconded
by
mr.
saunders.
this
is
on
page
40
of
the
record.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
at
folio
119.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
this
is
how
it
moved,
seconded
by
mr.
saunders,
"that
the
regents
prayer
be
said
daily
in
our
schools".
motion
carried
by
a
majority
vote
mr.
freed
(inaudible).
the
board
of
direct
--
the
board
of
education
gave
direction
to
the
district
principal
that
this
be
instituted
as
a
daily
procedure
to
follow
the
salute
of
the
flag.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
now,
this
is
mandatory,
certainly,
on
the
principal
as
an
employee,
just
as
i
assumed
that
someone,
somewhere
along
the
line
here
in
this
court
directed
the
marshal
or
the
clerk
to
begin
the
work
of
this
court
with
a
prayer.
that
is
the
direction
which
is
followed
from
day
to
day.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
but
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
to
at
least
listen.
now,
if
i
may
invite
your
honors'
attention
on
this
same
question
to
page
27.
we
come
to
mr.
vitale's
affidavit
that
i
referred
to
and
quoted
before
in
which
the
--
he
recites
that
the
principals
and
the
teachers
were
directed
not
to
require
any
child
to
join
in
this
prayer.
there
are
many
resolutions
which
are
adopted
by
a
school
district
which
do
not
carry
out
all
of
the
distinct
regulations
by
which
the
policy
will
be
carried
out.
the
district
principal
in
court
here
today
has
carried
out
the
directions
of
the
board
of
education
many
times
merely
by
the
statement
of
the
policy
of
the
board.
but
you
are
correct
sir
in
saying
that
until
special
term
issued
its
order,
we
did
not
further
put
this
in
the
record
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
--
of
the
district
as
indeed
we
have
many
times
not
put
all
of
the
re
--
exact
regulations
by
which
a
policy
will
be
carried
out.
this
being
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
no,
sir.
no
--
no,
the
children
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes.
those
children
who
do
not
wish
to
join
in
the
prayer
or
whose
parents
do
not
wish
them
to
join
in
the
payer
--
prayer,
may
remin
--
remain
seated,
they
may
remain
silent.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
if
that
is
their
wish.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
sir.
now,
there
are
many
times,
i'm
sure
in
classrooms
as
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
no,
sir.
they
may
be
excused
entirely
from
being
in
the
room
when
the
prayer
is
said
if
they
so
wish.
and
we
have
had
no
such
request
to
this
date.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
as
to
the
practice
from
the
time
it
was
adopted,
we
relied
on
mr.
vitale's
affidavit
at
page
27.
as
to
what
was
done
as
a
result
of
special
term
is
in
my
brief
at
--
it's
on
my
brief
here.
i
couldn't
find
it.
on
page
2
of
my
brief,
the
--
the
respondent's
brief,
we
have
the
implementing
resolutions
which
were
adopted
in
september
of
1959
to
carry
out
judge
myer's
suggestions.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
page
2
of
my
brief,
sir.
and
that
is
where
it
is
indicated
in
furtherance
of
judge
myers'
opinion,
teachers
are
not
to
comment,
they
are
not
to
cause
any
particular
posture
to
be
suggested,
no
particular
dress
to
be
worn
but
simply
a
question
of
joining
if
they
so
wish.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
well
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
no,
sir.
now
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
that
is
my
position,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
no,
sir.
it's
a
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
that's
correct,
sir.
this
is
an
affirmation
of
all
that
we
have
learned
since
we
were
youngsters.
now,
i
have
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
is
it
a
religious
practice?
no
more
so
than
the
saying
of
any
prayer
on
a
publication
--
on
a
public
occasion
is
a
religious
practice.
any
group
of
men
who
gather
together
for
dinner
commence
with
a
prayer.
this
to
that
extent
is
a
religious
practice.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
except
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
now,
i
lost
your
question
when
i
got
to
the
end
of
that.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
when
we
--
we
get
back
to
the
word
of
religious
practice,
we
refer
the
court
for
instance
to
the
language
of
our
own
court
of
appeals
which
along
the
lines
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
stating
what
he
understood
my
position
to
be.
our
court
of
appeals
says
whenever
people
gather
together
in
a
group
and
utter
a
prayer,
a
recognition
of
almighty
as
has
been
consistently
done
since
the
founding
of
the
country
hundreds
of
years
ago.
we
don't
find
constitutional
objections.
how
then
can
we
say
that
prayer
is
alright
on
any
public
occasion
in
a
state
paid
for
a
building
with
state
employees
except
in
the
school?
it
can
only
rest
if
we
get
down
to
whether
or
not
this
is
teaching
religion
as
distinct
from
acknowledging
publicly
the
fact
that
we
have
a
god.
now,
i've
--
in
closing
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
well,
i
have
co-counsel
here
and
i'm
approaching
out
of
statute.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
from
kindergarten
through
18.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes
sir,
high
school.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
i
think
that
mr.
girard
was
certainly
entitled
to
his
opinion.
i
think
that
the
board
of
education
--
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
yes,
sir.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
i
correctly
interpolate
your
summary
of
what
he
was
thinking.
he
says
that
up
until
a
child
becomes
18,
he
really
doesn't
know
what
he
wants
to
do
about
religion
or
about
a
belief
in
god.
mr.
bertram
b.
daiker
well,
i
--
i
--
i
must
only
come
back
to
saying,
he's
certainly
is
entitled
to
his
opinion
that
until
18,
a
child
is
incapable
of
recognizing
god.
but
the
founders
and
the
government
of
this
country
don't
so
believe
because
we
used
the
words
under
god
and
now
pledge
to
the
flag
for
six-year-olds
today
when
they
get
to
their
social
studies
and
then
history,
they're
going
to
study
the
declaration
of
independence.
they
will
in
the
case
of
public
assemblies
join
and
sing,
"come
now
almighty
king".
the
child
certainly
can
recognize
that
and
if
mr.
girard's
argument
would
have
prevailed
then
we
would
have
to
literally
rewrite
history
as
i
suggested
before.
i,
of
course,
joined
in
the
conclusion
in
my
brief
that
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
lower
court
brought
in
but
mr.
chandler
has
an
intervening
thought
to
express.
i
don't
want
to
be
lost
on
that
last
thought.
