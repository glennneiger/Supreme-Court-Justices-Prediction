where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
you
think
that
--
that
would
throw
light
on
the
meaning
of
the
prayer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
recommended?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
it's
only
the
prayer
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
part
of
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
really
--
really
have
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
really
asked
you
the
question
why
because
you
do
such
--
apparently
quick
distinction
between
that
and
reading
another
religious
book
called
the
"bible".
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
prayer
invoked
some
other
god
besides
the
--
the
one
it
apparently
invoked.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
suggest
the
probability
you
are
not
like
that
that
have
to
argue
one
like
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
not
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
not
have
compulsory
education?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
compulsory
attendance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
began
to
discuss
the
--
you
referred
to
justice
frankfurter's
reference
to
this
prayer
as
an
avowal
of
faith,
i
gathered
then
that
you
agreed
to
the
(inaudible)
and
i
have
assumed
from
what
you
are
saying
now
that
you
do
agree
to
it,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
prayer
is
itself
is
an
avowal
of
faith.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
without
belonging
to
a
sect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
without
belonging
to
a
sect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
want
to
delay
you
but
you
said
not
to
join
--
they
were
told
they
need
not
join
in
the
prayer?
what
does
that
mean?
they
didn't
have
to
rise
when
the
prayer
was
spoken?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
--
may
remain
seated
and
silent
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
while
all
the
others
rise
and
salute
the
flag
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
salute
the
flag
and
listen
to
the
prayer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
extent
of
the
excuse
that
supported
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
--
page
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
the
petitioner,
he
had
a
contest
that
you
--
i
thought
he
said
that
to
be
excused,
leave
the
rooms,
i
have
been
asked
to
be
excused
in
the
rooms
or
didn't
know
where
they'd
go.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
that
contest,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
--
is
that
a
correct
statement
from
our
public
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
mean
all
tax
supported
institutions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
he?
why
do
you
compare
that
to
the
daily
prayer
in
school
which
a
judge,
from
what
you
say,
you
devotedly
believe
that's
a
wonderful
thing
for
the
religious
education
of
the
people
of
this
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
is
compared
with
--
to
mohammad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
with
what
it
is
now,
this
prayer
values
should
have
to
--
would
be
to
mohammad
--
mohammadan,
would
you
claim
that
the
local
community
could
justify
that
prayer
being
given
out
of
the
tax
money
of
the
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
either
--
let's
take
it
first
not
in
a
mohammadan
community.
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
--
do
you
think
that
a
--
that
there
--
there's
a
local
option
in
connection
with
whether
you
can
teach
religion
in
the
public
schools?
justice
hugo
l.
black
tax
paid
school.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
made
a
mistake
in
using
the
word
"teaching‚Äù.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
think
or
do
you
argue
tax
paid
schools
throughout
the
country,
public
schools,
and
if
they
desire
to
do
so,
teach
mohammadan
prayer
and
one
christian
prayer
and
another
jewish
prayers
and
another
shinto
prayers
and
another.
