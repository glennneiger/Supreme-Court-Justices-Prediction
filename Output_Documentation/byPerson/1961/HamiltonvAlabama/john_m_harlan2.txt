justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
make
you
--
ask
you
a
question,
did
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
make
any
finding
with
respect
to
the
truth
of
mr.
mayfield's
statement
that
he
considered
himself
to
be
this
man's
lawyer
shortly
after
the
second
indictment
was
found
though
he
had
been
formally
reappointed
so
to
speak?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
if
the
mayfield
affidavit
is
taken
as
true,
he
did
have
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
arraignment
but
he
didn't
have
counsel
who,
for
one
reason
or
another,
showed
up
at
the
time
of
the
arraignment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
the
real
issue
here
in
this
case
with
their
due
process,
the
alabama
court
says,
as
a
matter
of
law,
he's
entitled
to
have
counsel
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
let's
assume
that's
the
federal
law
too,
presumingly.
is
what
you've
got
here
a
due
process
claim
that
says
that
at
least
as
to
court-appointed
counsel,
the
due
process
requires
that
the
state
not
proceed
without
requiring
counsel
to
be
present
at
the
arraignment.
is
that
the
real
issue
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
formally?
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
mayfield
also
says
unless
i'm
mistaken,
understanding
of
his
affidavit,
that
shortly
after
the
indictment
of
february,
the
second
indictment,
the
ravishing,
he
was
told
by
the
district
attorney
that
the
indictment
had
been
found
that
he
considered
himself
this
man's
lawyer.
but
that
for
reasons
of
his
own,
whatever
they
were,
he
just
didn't
show
up
at
the
arraignment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
you'd
--
if
you'd
take
those
facts
as
established,
then
what
you
have
got
here
as
a
due
process
claim
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether
or
not
even
though
he
had
a
lawyer
in
a
nominal
sense,
the
payor
of
the
lawyer
who
appear
who
was
such
ineffective
representation
and
denied
due
process,
or
that
as
a
matter
of
law
at
least
as
to
court-appointed
counsel,
the
state
cannot
proceed
unless
that
lawyer
is
required
to
show
up.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
it
isn't
the
conventional
right
to
counsel
case.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
john
m.
harlan
right
to
the
presence
of
counsel.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals
--
or
your
supreme
court's
opinion
on
28
and
29.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
coram
nobis.
and
--
yes,
i'm
looking
at
the
printed
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
it
says
we
hold
that
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
made
to
appear
in
this
proceeding
that
hamilton
was
not
represented
by
counsel
at
the
time
he
was
arraigned.
do
you
take
that
to
mean
that
lacking
the
formal
appointment
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
he
could
not
be
considered
to
have
mayfield
as
his
assigned
attorney
at
that
time
or
merely
that
even
though
mayfield's
original
appointment
had
(inaudible)
mayfield
is
not
physically
present
at
--
at
the
arraignment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
take
it's
the
meaning
of
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
flipped
this
record
through
on
the
bench,
perhaps
this
is
the
(inaudible)
just
following
this
episode,
the
court
had
told
him
that
he
wouldn't
allow
any
defendant
to
ask
any
questions
he
wanted
himself,
after
his
lawyer
mayfield,
about
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
at
the
outset,
the
defendant
discard
to
exercise
that
privilege
and
then
it's(inaudible)
and
apparent
that
he
wasn't
able
to
articulate
or
to
ask
questions
that
(inaudible)
and
he
stopped
exercising
that
privilege.
but
he
was
never
cut
off
from
doing
it,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
beyond
that,
i
couldn't
find
any
--
and
i
again
say
that
i
read
this
--
flipped
this
(inaudible)
from
the
bench.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
couldn't
find
any
episode
other
than
the
colloquy
that
you
referred
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
would
evidence
any,
typewritten
at
least,
quarrel
between
himself
and
his
lawyer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
it
comes
to
the
charge,
the
charge
was
about
--
