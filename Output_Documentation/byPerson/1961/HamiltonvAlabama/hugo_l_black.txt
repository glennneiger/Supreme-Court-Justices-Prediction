justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they've
been
held
synonymous
by
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
mr.
mentz,
on
the
point
that
i
was
just
disturbed
perhaps,
i
think
it's
rather
important.
is
it
a
fact
that
we
have
to
consider
in
this
case
on
the
opinions
written
by
judge
lawson
that
this
man
had
no
counsel
that
had
been
appointed
for
him
when
he
was
arraigned
and
that
no
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
him
until
three
days
later?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
being
the
case,
it's
not
material,
is
it,
what
mr.
mayfield
would
have
done
had
he
been
counsel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question
for
my
own
(inaudible),
is
mr.
mayfield
still
practicing
in
birmingham?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
related
to
judge
mayfield?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
this
man
from
tuscaloosa?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wasn't
--
that's
according
to
my
own
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
do
want
to
ask
you
on
that.
what
does
--
what
can
a
man
waive
by
not
raising
a
question,
if
he
doesn't
raise
it
at
arraignment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
wanted
to
challenge
--
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
wanted
to
challenge
the
indictment
with
reference
to
the
language
of
it
or
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
that
composed
it
on
account
of
discrimination
in
drawing
the
grand
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
later,
but
he
has
to
have
the
court's
permission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
up
to
that
point,
it
certainly
--
it
could
be
that
necessity
might
arise
in
order
for
him
to
make
objections
to
the
indictment
to
its
form,
to
its
contents
or
to
the
impaneling
of
the
grand
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
discretionary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
can
say
that
you
always
have
to
show
that
injury,
that
if
he
were
to
allege
that
he
didn't
have
a
counsel
to
represent
him
when
he's
being
tried.
that
he'd
have
to
go
further
and
show
that
that
injured
him.
does
your
court's
opinion
go
that
far?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
separates
the
parts
and
says
that
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
means
that
what
was
said
in
powell,
i
believe,
that
every
stage
of
the
proceeding
can
be
divided
up
into
parts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
way
i
read
the
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you
will
find
if
you'll
look
up
the
cases,
we
had
quite
a
number
of
cases
where
it
was
lost
irre
--
held
to
be
irrevocably
lost
by
state
supreme
courts,
the
right
to
challenge
the
composition
of
the
jury
by
reason
of
discrimination
and
selection.
in
one
i
recall,
we
had
of
course
proceed
to
devise
was
that
the
man
had
to
claim
--
attack
it
as
i
recall
it,
it
was
in
ten
days
after
the
indictment
was
returned
and
he
escaped.
and
the
--
this
court
held
--
impelled
under
those
circumstances
to
hold
that
he
had
waived
his
right
to
challenge
whatever
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
problem
here
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whether
the
man
can
waive
it
--
the
problem
here
is
whether
that
constitutional
right
to
representation
by
counsel.
he
denied
him
because
the
record
fails
to
show
he
was
injured.
and
as
the
chief
justice
said,
i
cannot
see
why
if
that
would
relieve
the
man
--
take
away
from
the
man
his
right
to
counsel
under
those
circumstance
or
arraignment,
it
wouldn't
take
it
away
at
the
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
probably
the
type
of
situation
he
was
hypothesizing
as
i
recall
it
would
exist
in
the
case
of
a
preliminary
trial,
the
man
is
charged
on
a
preliminary
charge
of
a
felony.
the
court
goes
through
a
preliminary
proceeding.
he
may
not
put
up
any
defense
of
any
kind
or
have
no
special
pleas,
that
that
doesn't
affect
him
directly.
what
he
says
there
doesn't
affect
him
as
to
his
right
to
raise
something
after
indictment,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
would
--
that
would
be
the
type
of
situation
that
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
hypothesized.
but
here,
under
the
practice
and
the
law,
it
is
the
duty
to
raise
certain
questions
at
the
arraignment
and
permission
to
raise
those
later
is
on
the
sufferance
of
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
yes.
i
wasn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
was
saying
however
that
we
had
a
number
of
cases
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
where
procedural
devices
--
or
not
devices,
i'm
not
saying
(inaudible)
but
procedural
requirements
have
been
held
to
bar
raising
questions
of
this
kind
and
some
those
as
i
recall
it
had
been
arraignments.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
mr.
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
justice
frankfurter,
the
only
--
of
course
the
--
the
case
on
appeal
went
off
primarily
on
the
facts
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
point
of
nonrepresentation
by
counsel
at
arraignment
was
raised,
yes
sir.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
permitted
--
they
were
permitted
to
challenge
it
on
the
coram
nobis
because
they
went
behind
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
case
is
as
i
recall
it,
by
reason
of
the
case
of
betts
versus
brady
should
not
be
held
finding
here,
that
was
not
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
he
could
have
attempted
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
not
a
matter
of
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it,
there
was
no
evidence
that
she
was
a
victim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
she
was
a
victim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
drawn
as
i
recall
it,
i
read
all
the
evidence
some
time
ago.
as
i
recall
it
from
the
fact
of
it,
the
testimony
that
this
man
was
there
with
nothing
but
a
pair
of
corduroy,
which
is
on
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
corduroy
and
shirt
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
shoe
under
the
bed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
based
on
a
threat
to
do
it,
not
on
the
actual
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
hamilton
and
what
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
first
one
as
i
recalled
it,
am
i
wrong
about
that
charge
merely
burglary
with
intent
to
steal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
testified
with
reference
intent
to
rape?
justice
hugo
l.
black
its
right
here,
i
read
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it,
mr.
milko
testified
that
he
went
into
this
room
and
found
the
man
there.
and
that
the
man
was
standing
there,
he
said,
that
he
then
went
back
into
his
room,
got
his
revolver
and
returned.
and
when
he
returned
with
his
revolver,
the
man
was
still
standing
precisely
the
same
place
he
had
been
when
he
was
found
and
mr.
milko
left.
as
i
recall
it,
that
was
the
evidence
and
that
seems
to
be
what
judge
livingston
said
was
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
keep
juries
there
all
the
time,
do
they
not?
juries
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
cases
are
set
constantly
and
one
judge
frequently
(inaudible)
to
the
other
judges.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
--
i'm
sure
you're
not
arguing
that
he
didn't
need
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
sure
you're
not
arguing
that
he
didn't
need
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
--
can
you
think
of
any
case,
of
any
kind
where
he
wouldn't
have
--
where
he
would've
needed
a
lawyer
more?
justice
hugo
l.
black
needed
a
lawyer
more
than
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
there's
no
doubt
whether
he
had
a
lawyer
while
he
was
being
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
decided
before,
i
asked
you
the
powell
case,
i
have
forgotten
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
counsel
for
defendant
did
ask
for
a
charge
if
that
must
be
established
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
the
court
denied
that
on
the
ground
that
it
was
covered
in
the
old
charge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
supreme
court
held
that
was
probably
denied,
that
charge,
because
it
again
substantially
covered
in
the
old
charge.
