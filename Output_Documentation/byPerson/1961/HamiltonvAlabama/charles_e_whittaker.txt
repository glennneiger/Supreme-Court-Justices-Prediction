justice
charles

whittaker
one
can
be
sentenced
to
death
in
this
state
simply
for
a
burglary
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
with
intent
to
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
to
commit
petty
larceny?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
i
misunderstood,
mr.
mentz,
but
i
thought
your
court
accepted
petitioner's
showing
that
he
was
not
represented
at
the
arraignment
and
said
--
but
there
is
no
showing
that
this
disadvantaged
him
and
therefore,
the
writ
is
denied.
isn't
that
--
is
my
understanding
right
or
not
on
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then
if
that's
so,
it
puts
a
burden
on
him
to
show
as
i
understood
judge
--
justice
black's
question
not
merely
that
he
was
denied
counsel
at
arraignment
but
also
that
it
hurt
him.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
the
burden
of
the
accused,
is
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
a
different
thing
than
if
he
made
it
to
appear
affirmatively,
the
petitioner
did,
that
it
did
not
injure
him,
but
i
should
think
that
if
he
has
a
--
an
unqualified
right
to
counsel
at
his
arraignment,
then
some
inference
of
injury
flows
and
he
has
no
further
burden
at
least
until
someone
--
the
state
has
gone
forward.
i
just
don't
know
what
would
you
say
about
this?
