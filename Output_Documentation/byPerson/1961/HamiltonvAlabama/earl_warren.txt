number

charles
clarence
hamilton,
petitioner,
versus
alabama.
mrs.
motley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
have
the
death
penalty
for
burglary
with
intent
to
steal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this,
the
first
count
--
first
indictment
of
course
was
a
one-count
indictment
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
burglary
with
intent
to
steal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
was
the
second
indictment,
was
that
the
one
or
a
two-count
indictment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
may
i
return
to
the
facts
just
a
moment
and
ask
you
after
this
man
was
detected
in
the
house
there
by
the
grandchildren,
i
think
you
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
attempt
to
--
did
he
attempt
to
escape
or
did
he
stay
there
until
the
police
came
after
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
had
notified
the
police?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
there
was
a
suggestion
somewhere
along
the
line
of
insanity
in
the
case,
that
was
at
the
end,
was
it
not,
on
the
new
trial
or
at
some
stage
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mrs.
motley
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mrs.
motley,
in
addition
to
that
affidavit
that
you've
been
speaking
about,
aren't
we
also
entitled
to
take
into
consideration
and
shouldn't
we
the
fact
that
this
man
was
not
appointed
by
the
court
for
this
second
case
until
three
days
after
the
indictment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
to
be
taken
at
least
as
much
into
consideration
as
to
the
opinion
of
mr.
--
whatever
his
name
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
to
whether
he
might
be
the
lawyer
when
he
didn't
even
think
enough
of
the
case
to
show
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
we
--
that
is
--
you
don't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
take
that
out
of
the
case,
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
motley,
in
order
that
i
might
be
oriented
on
it,
do
i
understand
there
are
two
prongs
to
your
argument
about
representation
of
counsel.
first,
there
was
actually
no
counsel
there
to
represent
him
and
secondly,
that
he
didn't
have
any
counsel
in
this
case
because
he
was
not
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
the
man
in
this
case
until
three
days
after
the
arraignment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
time
at
which
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
must
be
challenged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
agree?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
recess
now.
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
mentz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
can
show
up
in
the
arraignment,
can
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
he
was
not
--
he
was
not
the
attorney
for
the
man
in
this
indictment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
got
to
decide
it
one
way
or
the
other,
either
he
was
the
man's
lawyer
for
this
indictment
or
he
wasn't,
which
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
if
that
--
that's
your
position
here,
that
he
was
not
the
attorney
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
him
at
the
--
on
the
second
indictment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
that's
a
fair
--
fair
position
to
take.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
about
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
does
that
fall
in
the
same
category?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
does
bar
his
absolute
right
to
enter
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
does
bar
his
absolute
right
to
have
it
entered.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
did
that
pro
se?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
(inaudible)
represented.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
it's
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general,
how
would
you
distinguish
legally
this
factual
situation
from
the
one
where
he
was
--
we'll
say
he
was
denied
counsel
at
his
trial,
at
the
actual
trial?
supreme
court
says
here
the
burden
is
on
him
although
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel
this
time,
the
burden
is
on
him
to
prove
that
he
was
prejudiced.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
the
--
he
has
a
right,
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel
at
the
trial.
now,
would
you
say
also
that
if
he
was
denied
counsel
at
the
trial,
that
the
same
burden
was
on
him,
and
if
it
isn't,
how
do
you
differentiate
the
two
factual
situations
legally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
a
question
of
degree
only?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
the
man
cannot
of
his
volition
demand
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
insanity
and
if
he
cannot
on
his
own
demand
test
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
and
if
he
cannot
of
his
own
volition
demand
the
right
to
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
jury
after
arraignment,
has
he
not
been
deprived
to
something.
isn't
it
more
than
a
formality?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
apparently,
they
didn't
--
apparently,
they
didn't
think
the
first
charge
was
wrong,
they
just
added
something
to
it
because
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
included
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
so,
it
wasn't
a
typographical
error.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
not
an
attempt
to
steal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
grandchildren
compelled
him
to
put
his
trousers
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
will.
if
you
will,
please,
if
it
won't
inconvenience
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
the
counsel
said
that
he
was
publicly
reprimanded
in
front
of
the
jury
for
his
questions
and
his
actions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
the
judge
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
motley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
get
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
motley,
in
the
charge,
did
the
judge
define
ravish
and
equate
that
to
rape
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
--
no
crime
called
to
ravish.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
state
of
--
of
this
state.
and
the
indictment
says
that
he
entered
this
place
with
the
intent
to
ravish.
the
indictment
did
not
name
the
person
who
was
supposed
to
be
ravished
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
court
did
not
instruct
the
jury
as
to
the
definition
of
ravish
or
whether
it
was
--
it
was
the
same
as
rape
under
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
law
of
that
state.
and
in
other
words,
there
was
no
definition
as
to
what
constituted
ravish.
