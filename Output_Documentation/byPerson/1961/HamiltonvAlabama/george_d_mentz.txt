mr.
george
d.
mentz
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court.
before
i
get
into
my
regular
presentation,
mr.
justice
whittaker
has
expressed
some
concern
over
the
severity
of
our
statute.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
read
it
to
you
sir.
it's
title
14,
section
85
of
our
code
of
1940.
any
person
who
in
the
night
time
with
intent
to
steal
or
to
commit
a
felony
breaks
into
and
enters
any
inhabited
dwelling,
house,
or
any
other
house
or
building
which
is
occupied
by
any
person
lodged
therein
--
herein
is
guilty
of
burglary
in
the
first
degree
and
shall
on
conviction
be
punished
at
the
discretion
of
the
jury
or
by
death
or
by
imprisonment
in
the
penitentiary
for
not
less
than
ten
years.
so
i
think
the
real
essence
of
the
severity
of
the
punishment
there
is
the
violation
of
the
sanctity
of
the
home
particularly
at
night,
where
a
person
is
with
--
in
a
home
which
is
inhabited.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
rape
is,
sir
--
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
and
our
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
commit
a
felony.
yes,
as
i
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
rape
is
a
felony,
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
in
that
time,
no
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir,
our
indictments
to
have
been
--
that
has
been
accepted
by
the
supreme
court
as
an
acceptable
indictment
under
the
statute.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir,
i
think
so.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
--
i
can't
answer
that,
i
don't
know.
now,
much
has
been
said
about
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
and
i
can
only
urge
the
court
to
read
the
record
carefully
and
i
think
they
will
see
that
mr.
mayfield
was
effective
as
counsel.
we
say
he
recognized
the
fact
that
an
attorney,
be
he
court-appointed
or
employed,
must
do
his
utmost
reply,
but
he
can't
in
a
matter
of
factual
evidence.
and
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
he
can.
that
of
course
we've
--
as
has
been
pointed
out,
he
was
--
he
was
appointed
for
the
first
arraignment
--
and
however,
he
was
not
appointed
for
the
second
arraignment
until
three
days
after
the
arraignment.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
mean
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
that
--
that
sir
is
--
i
can't
answer
you
yes
or
no
because
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
--
it's
a
fringed
area.
well
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well
sir,
our
supreme
court
has
admitted
that
he
was
not
the
attorney
at
the
second
indictment.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
and
still
further
with
reference
to
the
effectiveness
of
mr.
mayfield
now,
i'm
reading
from
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
when
they
affirmed
the
judgment
of
conviction.
and
it
says
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir,
i
have
to
confessed,
i'm
reading
from
the
brief,
the
petitioner's
brief,
it's
page
8a.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
it's
down
toward
the
bottom.
at
most
the
statement
made
by
the
appellant
indicated
only
that
he
did
not
approve
the
court-appointed
attorney.
but
present
counsel
insists
that
under
these
circumstances,
representation
could
be
nothing
more
than
pro
forma.
but
in
their
brief,
with
commendable
candor,
they
stated
and
thus
quote,
“we
do
not
mean
to
reflect
upon
the
capabilities
of
counsel
representing
the
defendant.”
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir,
that's
my
understanding
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
so
far
as
i
know
he
is
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that,
i
don't
know,
sir.
i
really
don't
know
mr.
clell
mayfield.
i
knew
judge
mayfield's
son
but
i
don't
know
the
other
branches
of
the
family.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
don't
know
that
sir.
he
attended
the
university
of
alabama,
that's
all
i
can
tell
you
and
--
but
i
--
i
don't
know
where
he
was
born.
i
know
when
he
was
born
but
not
where.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
as
we
understand
this
case,
the
primary
question
presented
is
whether
or
not
denial
of
counsel
at
arraignment
in
a
state
capital
case
in
and
of
itself
violates
due
process.
now,
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
contention
that
it
does
not,
then
the
second
question
is
whether
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
present
such
a
showing
of
fundamental
unfairness
as
to
warrant
a
determination
that
by
--
due
process
has
been
violated.
as
to
the
first
question,
namely
whether
such
denial
per
se
violates
due
process,
i
think
it
is
significant
in
alabama,
arraignment
is
merely
a
calling
of
the
accused
to
the
bar
of
the
court,
and
reading
or
explaining
the
indictment
to
him,
and
demanding
his
plea.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
alright,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir,
in
practical
effect,
he
doesn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
in
practical
effect,
he
does
not
waive
anything.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
with
the
court's
permission,
he
may
raise
those
objections
subsequent
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that
is
conceivable,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir,
it
does.
our
statute
provides
that
it
shall
be
entered
at
arraignment.
however,
our
decisions,
our
court
decisions
have
held
that
that
does
not
peremptorily
or
absolutely
bar
such
a
plea
from
being
entered
subsequent
to
arraignment.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
it
is
discretionary
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
now,
our
statute
does
prescribe
that
an
indigent
charged
with
a
capital
offence
shall
have
court-appointed
counsel
to
represent
him.
and
our
state
supreme
court
recognizing
that
the
right
to
representation
by
counsel
is
not
a
right
limited
to
a
trial
on
the
merits
stated
that
hamilton
should
have
been
represented
by
counsel
at
this
certain
arraignment.
however,
on
his
appeal,
hamilton
ineptly
attempted
to
dispute
the
minute
entry
of
march
the
1st
and
the
judgment
entry
of
april
the
23rd,
both
of
which
showed
that
he
was
represented
by
counsel
on
his
arraignment
on
march
1st.
he
did
this
by
offering
his
evidence
only
the
judges'
bench
notes
and
under
our
procedure
that
is
not
permissible.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir.
he
was
represented
by
--
well,
he
was
represented
by
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
present
attorneys
here
but
the
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
orzell
billingsley
and
peter
hall
represented
him
on
that
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
--
proceeding.
and
that
was
why
his
appeal
failed
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
when
it
was
brought
up
here.
now,
his
subsequent
petition
for
coram
nobis
which
was
supported
by
competent
evidence
showing
that
hamilton
did
not
have
counsel
at
arraignment
failed
because
it
did
not
allege
or
offer
evidence
showing
that
he
was
disadvantaged
or
prejudiced
in
anyway
by
such
denial
of
representation.
our
courts
have
said
that
in
the
extraordinary
writ
of
coram
nobis
that
a
mere
naked
allegation
that
a
constitutional
right
has
been
invaded
will
not
suffice.
and
it
simply
followed
a
doctrine
which
was
restated
by
this
court
in
darcy
versus
handy
--
well,
and
this
is
a
very
short
quotation.
it
is
not
asking
too
much
that
the
burden
of
showing
essential
on
fairness
be
sustained
by
him
who
claims
such
injustice
and
seeks
to
have
the
result
set
aside
and
that
it
be
sustained
not
as
a
matter
of
speculation
but
as
a
demonstrable
reality.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no,
sir.
it
isn't
a
pleading
question.
it's
not
a
technical
pleading
question
but
it
--
it
does
boil
down
to
the
question
of
whether
the
simple
allegation
of
denial
of
counsel
of
--
at
arraignment
violates
due
process.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
would
think
so,
yes.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
although
it
does
seem
to
me
sir
that
in
any
legal
proceeding
where
you
assert
that
some
right
has
been
denied,
it
seems
logical
to
me
that
you
must
also
assert
that
some
injury
has
resulted
from
it.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir,
the
court's
opinion
doesn't
go
that
far,
no
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
think
they're
right
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
think
you're
right
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
think
--
that
is
my
thinking
on
it,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
i
--
just
respectfully
disagree
with
you,
sir,
on
that.
i
--
that's
all
i
can
say.
i
still
say
--
i'm
of
the
opinion
that
even
though
a
--
an
inalienable
right
has
been
denied,
then
if
someone
seeks
to
complain
about
it,
he's
got
to
show
that
some
disadvantage
resulted
to
it
--
to
him
from
it,
from
the
(inaudible)
from
that.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
your
honor,
i
think
arraignment
is
more
or
less
a
formality
actually.
the
trial
court
said
its
--
it's
the
trial,
that's
where
the
facts
are
determined.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
sir,
but
of
great
degree.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir.
i
don't
--
i
don't
quite
agree
with
you
on
that.
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
as
i
say
at
arraignment,
we
admit
that
many
of
these
things
should
be
done,
in
other
words,
they're
going
to
attack
on
the
composition
of
the
juries,
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
it
should
be
filed
there,
but
it
is
not
irrevocably
lost
if
he
does
not
file
those
at
that
time.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir,
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
particular
case
and
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir.
mr.
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
--
justice
clark,
there
was
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
don't
know
sir.
i
-
i
would
like
to
point
that
--
to
mr.
justice
clark,
that
the
--
that
there
has
been
no
intimation
in
here.
that
there
was
anything
improper
about
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
or
there
has
been
some
slight
intimation
of
insanity
but
it
consisted
of
two
affidavits
which
were
adduced
at
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
one
was
from
the
defendant's
mother,
the
other
was
from
his
cousin.
the
latter
only
saw
him
on
sundays
when
she
went
to
get
the
--
her
sister
to
go
to
church
and
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
so
that
they
will
present
it
at
the
time
that
an
application
for
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
filed
following
his
conviction.
those
after
the
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
after
the
jury's
(voice
overlap),
yes
sir.
those
particular
affidavits
indicated
that
the
defendant
was
very
restless,
egotistical,
shiftless
sort
of
individual.
there's
no
--
nothing
to
indicate
insanity.
and
at
the
trial
itself,
mr.
mayfield
introduced
one
or
two
men
who
knew
hamilton
well
and
they
indicated
--
gave
no
indication
whatsoever
that
he
was
insane.
in
fact
they
testified
that
is
reputation
was
good.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir.
no
sir,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that.
now,
that
could've
been
done
at
any
time.
and
as
a
practical
matter
we
do
have
that
done
under
our
procedure,
in
other
words,
where
a
man
is
charged
with
a
capital
offense,
sometimes
he
can
negotiate
with
the
solicitor.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir,
our
indictments
just
don't
do
that.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
indictment,
no
sir,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well
sir,
i
don't
think
any
formality
is
a
mere
formality.
i
--
if
i
said
that,
i
didn't
mean
to.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
but
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
don't
think
so,
no
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir.
that
is
our
practice.
sir,
you
mentioned
michel,
that
is
louisiana,
rather
than
alabama.
now,
i
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
don't
know
whether
that
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
--
whether
that
make
any
difference
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
well
that
--
as
i
say,
those
went
off
on
as
i
recall,
michel
went
off
on
the
question
of
a
waiver
and
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir,
yes.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
did
not
control,
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct,
sir.
that
is
the
basic
difference
now
of
the
facts
which
the
court
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir,
yes
sir.
but
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
well
as
i
--
the
court
said
that
it
was
precluded
from
considering
that
point
because
the
minute
and
the
judgment
entries
showed
that
he
was
represented
by
counsel
at
arraignment
and
the
method
of
attack
was
by
means
of
the
judges'
bench
notes
and
they
--
our
court
held
that
that
was
not
permissible
proceeding.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
you
denied
that,
yes.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
they
went
behind
the
record,
they
--
and
introduced
the
affidavit
of
mr.
mayfield
who
stated
that
he
was
not
present
at
the
arraignment
and
--
now,
as
petitioner's
counsel
has
pointed
out,
we
feel
that
this
court
has
recognized
the
representation
by
counsel
at
arraignment
in
the
state
court
is
not
an
absolute
necessity,
at
least
in
a
non-capital
case
in
the
canizio
versus
new
york,
there
was
a
19-year-old
indigent,
fully
educated
without
counsel.
when
he
was
arraigned,
he
pleaded
guilty
to
a
charge
of
robbery.
he
was
unfamiliar
with
his
legal
rights.
he
--
and
trial
court
didn't
inform
him
of
his
right
to
counsel.
but
this
court
held
that
that
defect
was
cured
by
his
being
actively
represented
by
counsel
prior
to
the
time
of
sentencing
and
the
reasoning
was
that
counsel
could
have
moved
to
withdraw
that
plea
of
guilty.
and
the
trial
court
had
the
authority
to
let
him
withdraw
the
plea
of
guilty
and
let
canizio
stand
trial.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that
may
well
be
and
i
just
don't
recall.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
see.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
but
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
in
that
case,
it
was
argued
that
canizio
had
counsel
and
ample
time
to
take
advantage
of
every
right
that
would've
been
to
him
originally,
and
as
i
have
attempted
to
point
out,
the
hamilton
case
is
somewhere
--
now,
in
canizio,
he
pleaded
guilty.
in
hamilton's
essence
case,
he
pleaded
not
guilty.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir.
canizio
was
not
a
capital
case.
but
here,
we
have
mayfield
appointed
three
days
after
hamilton's
arraignment,
after
hamilton
had
pleaded
not
guilty
and
mayfield's
appointment
came
50
days
prior
to
the
date
of
the
actual
trial.
and
we
say
that
during
that
time,
he
could
have
--
with
the
court's
permission
and
had
he
considered
them
meritorious,
he
could
have
filed
--
he
could
have
moved
for
continuance,
he
could
have
moved
for
a
change
of
venue
had
he
considered
the
atmosphere
hostile,
he
could
have
file
motions
attacking
the
composition
of
the
juries.
he
could
have
withdrawn
the
plea
of
not
guilty
and
attempted
to
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
he
could
have
attempted,
yes
sir.
you're
correct
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir,
it
is
discretionary
with
the
trial
court,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
which
case
is
that
sir,
is
that
the
coram
nobis,
or
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
see,
sir,
28
and
29,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
don't
know
sir.
i
--
frankly,
i
take
it
to
mean
that
he
--
he
had
no
counsel
appointed
for
him.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that
is
my
personal
interpretation.
now,
but
in
line
with
canizio
case,
while
it
was
discretionary
with
the
trial
court,
the
trial
court
nevertheless
had
the
authority
to
grant
any
of
these
motions
that
i
just
mentioned.
now,
furthermore,
inasmuch
as
this
court
refused
to
review
a
federal
appellate
court,
amended
1955,
the
court
seemingly
recognized
the
principle
that
representation
by
counsel
at
arraignment
in
a
state
court
is
not
mandatory
even
in
a
capital
case.
i
refer
to
state
versus
sullivan
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
where
an
accused
charged
with
murder
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
is
immediately
thereafter
furnished
with
counsel
for
the
preparation
for
the
trial,
for
the
trial
itself,
and
proposed
trial
proceedings,
that
the
sentenced
rendered
is
not
void.
in
that
case,
the
court
found
that
there
was
a
complete
failure
of
any
showing
that
at
any
juncture
in
the
criminal
case,
the
accused
was
denied
any
substantive
or
procedural
right
which
might
have
been
available
to
him
except
for
such
plea.
the
court
logically
reasoned
that
the
petitioner
did
not
suffer
any
proscription
or
disadvantage
arising
out
of
the
plea
of
not
guilty.
and
therefore,
that
there
was
no
violation
of
due
process
or
any
impingement
of
fundamental
rights.
and
we
submit
that
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
somewhat
situation,
a
comparable
situation.
while
counsel
was
not
appointed
immediately,
he
was
appointed
three
days
later,
after
the
arraignment,
he
was
appointed
50
days
prior
to
the
trial.
and
in
line
with
state
versus
sullivan,
i
think
there's
a
very
close
analogy.
and
as
i
say,
in
his
petition
for
coram
nobis,
he
did
not
allege
and
he
did
not
offer
any
evidence
and
the
record
doesn't
show
that
he
was
injured
by
not
having
been
represented
by
counsel
at
arraignment.
now,
as
to
the
second
question
presented,
it's
our
contention
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
make
such
a
showing
a
fundamental
unfairness
as
to
warrant
a
decision
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
ordered
the
reversal
and
denying
hamilton's
petition
to
coram
nobis.
various
tests
have
been
applied
in
the
determination
of
what
constitutes
fundamental
unfairness,
and
they
include
the
gravity
of
the
offense,
the
nature
and
the
complexity
of
the
issues,
the
age
of
the
accused,
his
mental
capacity,
which
would
embrace
mental
illness
or
feeblemindedness.
his
background,
including
education
and
experience,
ignorance
or
literacy,
his
knowledge
of
law,
such
as
lack
of
familiarity
with
legal
rights,
capability
of
questioning
witnesses,
the
degree
of
protection
given
during
the
trial
as
it
appears
from
the
conduct
of
the
court
or
the
prosecutor,
or
any
other
like
inadequacy
which
makes
the
accused
incapable
of
conducting
his
own
defense
in
that
particular
stage
of
the
proceeding.
now
as
applied
--
as
we
apply
these
tests
to
the
present
case,
we
admit
of
course
that
the
offense
was
extremely
grave.
but
i
am
unable
to
see
where
the
issues
were
complex.
as
for
his
age,
the
record
doesn't
show
how
old
he
was
but
there's
no
claim
of
youthfulness
and
we
know
that
he
served
in
the
army
for
five
years.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir,
i
don't.
i'm
willing
to
accept
the
petitioner's
statement
that
the
trial
started
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
--
at
11
and
was
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
an
hour
and
40
minutes
for
lunch,
and
concluded
some
time
in
mid-afternoon
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
4:10
she
said.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
there
were
only
a
few
witnesses.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
there
were
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
the
witnesses
called
were
the
granddaughter
and
her
husband,
there
were
two
policemen,
there
were
two
or
three
witnesses
who
--
a
man
who
testified
as
to
hamilton's
whereabouts
on
the
night
of
the
alleged
crime
and
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir,
she
wasn't.
she
was
an
elderly
woman.
she
was
feeble.
she
was
practically
blind.
she
was
of
italian
descent
and
spoke
very
brokenly,
so
brokenly
that
the
--
according
to
the
defendant's
own
testimony,
he
couldn't
understand
it.
i
don't
think
she
would
have
made
a
very
good
witness
for
either
side.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that
she
was
what
sir?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir,
it
was
a
--
it
was
merely
an
attempt
to
ravish.
she
was
heard
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir,
he
was
in
his
underwear.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
he
had
a
shirt
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
and
his
underwear
with
his
privates
exposed,
his
shoes,
his
pants
lying
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
--
on
her
bed.
and
one
shoe
was
under
the
bed
and
one
shoe
was
near
the
door
and
the
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir
and
they
have
mentioned
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
door
having
been
forced.
i
disagree
with
them
on
that.
i
think
one
of
the
witnesses
did
testify
that
there
was
outburst,
the
door
had
been
locked
--
had
been
forced.
certainly
one
witness,
the
grandson
testified
that
when
he
went
to
bed,
the
door
was
locked.and
that
when
he
heard
the
grandmother
hollering
and
went
to
--
into
her
room,
the
door
was
wide
open.
and
they
have
talked
about
the
conflict
between
hamilton
and
his
attorney.
i
don't
--
think
the
reading
of
the
records
will
not
substantiate
that.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
hamilton
and
mr.
mayfield,
his
lawyer,
being
in
conflict.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
don't
think
there
was
such
conflict
as
they
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
--
import
it.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
at
the
outset,
hamilton
stated
--
first,
he
objected
to
the
--
being
tried
upon
the
second
indictment.
he
said
in
effect
--
he
said,
“it's
my
understanding
that
once
i'm
charged
--
if
i'm
charged
with
one
thing,
they
can't
take
that
off
and
put
something
else
on
me.”
and
then
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
to
steal,
yes.
and
mr.
deason,
his
deputy
solicitor
explained
that,
he
realized
that
some
--
there
was
a
typographical
error
or
just
to
clarify,
are
made
by
the
grand
jury
that
that
was
not
the
correct
indictment,
and,
so
for
that
reason,
a
second
presentment
was
made
to
the
--
another
grand
jury
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
that
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
it
was
--
no
sir,
it
wasn't
a
typographical
error.
we'll
say
that
it
was
never
in
--
it
didn't
go
as
far
as
it
should
have,
the
first
indictment,
because
certainly
under
the
evidence,
everything
indicated
an
intent
to
rape
the
old
lady.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
saw
no
evidence
of
an
intent
to
steal
in
--
there
might
have
been.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
the
granddaughter
of
the
alleged
victim
and
the
grandson,
two
police
officers,
the
--
the
granddaughter
and
her
husband
testified
that
they
heard
the
old
lady
hollering
in
the
next
room.
they
went
in
there,
they
found
the
defendant
in
his
clothes
--
in
his
shirt
only,
his
trousers
off,
his
private
is
hanging
out,
his
shoes
off,
his
trousers
on
the
woman's
bed,
and
they
also
testified
that
he
was
required
to
put
on
his
trousers
at
least.
i'm
not
sure
about
his
shoes.
but
that
he
did
not
button
his
trousers
and
that
when
the
police
got
there,
he
was
--
his
clothes
were
just
loosely
assembled
on
him.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
and
await
at
gunpoint
until
the
police
arrived.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
your
honor,
i
confess,
i
have
not
read
it.
i
only
came
in
the
case
about
a
month
ago
and
i
didn't
anticipate
this
question,
and
i
didn't
read
it.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
i
do.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
we
would
be
very
glad
to
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
it
goes
from
86
through
--
well,
at
the
top
of
93.
it
is
not
a
lot
--
a
long
charge.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
this
is
the
trial
record,
yes
sir,
which
you
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
think
it
is
here.
didn't
it
come
up
on
the
appeal?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
think
so,
but
i
should
be
very
happy
to
leave
this
record.
it
is
marked
up.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
im
sorry,
if
i
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
this
particular
part
did
take
place
in
open
court,
yes
sir.
at
the
outset
--
says
the
defendant,
before
the
trial
gets
underway,
i
have
been
here
for
seven
months
and
the
first
charge
that
was
brought
against
me
was
nighttime
burglary
with
intent
to
steal,
grand
jury,
july
1956,
and
that
was
the
charge.
and
now,
they
have
another
one
out.can
they
charge
me
two
times?
and
the
court
went
on
to
explain
that
he
was
indicted
by
one
grand
jury
and
that
a
second
grand
jury
returned
the
second
indictment.
and
the
defendant
says,
“it's
one
and
the
same
thing.
i
understand
that
once
they
put
a
charge
on
me
with
one
thing
they
can't
take
that
off
and
put
another
one
on
me.”
then
he
--
a
little
bit
further
down,
he
says,
“before
you
go
on,
let
me
say
this,
this
lawyer
is
not
my
lawyer.
he
was
appointed
by
the
court.”
the
court:
“the
law
provides
the
court
to
appoint
you
counsel.
you
were
appointed
the
lawyer
so
that
you
may
get
your
constitutional
rights.”
mr.
mayfield:
“i
would
like
to
request
permission
to
withdraw
from
this
case.”
the
court:
“permission
would
be
denied
at
this
time.
i
know
how
you
feel
about
it.
but
the
law
provides
that
this
man
have
counsel
and
he
did
not
have
one.
and
we
have
had
no
word
from
any
other
lawyer
other
than
yourself.
you
were
kind
enough
to
agree
to
represent
this
man
when
i
appointed
you
and
i
appreciate
it.
i
know
you
are
qualified
to
give
this
man
a
fair
trial
and
for
that
reason,
i
would
not
at
this
time
allow
you
to
withdraw.”
and
in
that
connection,
i
have
found
no
alabama
cases
in
point
but
i
have
found
some
federal
district
court
cases,
which
say
that
the
right
to
--
for
a
counsel
to
withdraw
or
for
the
defendant
to
demand
the
counsel
withdrawal
is
purely
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
and
that's
--
the
reason
is
obvious
because
the
defendant
could
indefinitely
stall
at
the
eve
of
trial
and
he
could
say,
“i
don't
want
this
man
to
represent
me.
they'd
have
to
carry
the
case
over
for
another
time.”
mr.
george
d.
mentz
the
defendant:
“before
you
go
on,
let
me
say
this,
this
lawyer
is
not
my
lawyer.
he
was
appointed
by
the
court.”
mr.
george
d.
mentz
never.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
--
no
time
did
he
request
that
the
lawyer
be
dismissed.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
your
honor,
i
don't
recall
any.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
(inaudible)
mr.
george
d.
mentz
you're
quite
right
sir,
i
have
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
don't
recall
the
counsel
said
that
it
was
done
before
the
jury.
they
did
say
that
this
episode
that
i
just
mentioned
to
the
court
before
the
jury
and
it
did
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
hamilton
was
reprimanded
but
he
was
reprimanded
not
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
if
i
may
--
he
--
the
court
excused
the
jury
and
then
he
cautioned
hamilton
as
to
the
effect
that
his
conduct
would
have
on
the
jury.
he
said
you're
sitting
up
there
reading
a
newspaper
or
pamphlet
of
some
kind,
you're
chewing
gum
and
he
cautioned
him,
he
said
now,
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
“you're
entitled
to
your
constitutional
rights
but
with
such
behavior
as
this,
you
can't
get
it.
you're
obliged
to
create
a
bad
influence
on
the
jury.
now
all
of
this
--
that
was
done
outside
of
the
jury
as
you'll
see
from
this
record.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir,
i
don't
call
it
a
reprimand.
i
have
to
call
it
bending
over
backwards
in
an
effort
to
be
fair
to
the
defendant.
and
certainly,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
has
pointed
out,
after
each
interrogation
or
after
the
interrogation
of
each
witness,
the
court
asked
hamilton,
they
said,
“now,
do
you
want
to
ask
this
witness
any
question?”
of
course,
hamilton
kept
hammering
away
what
he
was
trying
to
get
at
was
the
double
jeopardy
feature
of
the
second
indictment
as
to
what
went
on
in
the
grand
jury.
the
trial
judge
properly
ruled
that
those
questions
were
not
proper
or
pertinent
and
told
him
that
they
were
not.
now
--
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
also
that
hamilton
was
permitted
to
argue
the
case
personally
to
the
jury
when
--
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case.
during
the
trial,
hamilton
treated
his
--
mr.
mayfield
respectfully.
there's
no
evidence
that
he
argued
with
him.
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
this
build
up
about
open
conflict
of
being
at
war
with
each
other.
it
just
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
it
was
tried
in
jefferson
county,
alabama.
and
so,
they
have
a
very
heavy
--
mr.
justice
black
will
know
about
this,
birmingham
is
a
large
--
is
our
largest
county
--
city,
and
they
have
a
heavy
criminal
docket
at
all
times.
now,
it's
conceivable
that
the
calendar
may
have
accommodated
the
case
the
next
day.
it's
also
conceivable
that
they
may
have
been
a
delay
of
several
months.
i
guess
i
can't
give
you
a
definite
answer
on
that.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
there,
the
court
there
(inaudible)
--
of
course,
there
are
five
or
six
judges
holding
the
court
and
the
court
is
going
on
practically
all
the
time,
yes
sir
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir.
they
have
referred
to
this
man
as
being
illiterate.
we
know
he
reached
the
11th
grade.
we
know
he
served
three
years
in
the
army
honorably.
we
know
that
he
was
allowed
to
reenlist.
as
with
respect
to
his
legal
rights,
he
received
a
dishonorable
discharge
from
the
army
in
january
of
1956
and
that
presupposes
a
general
court
martial
at
which
he
was
represented
by
counsel
and
where
he
observed
legal
proceedings.
he
was
present
with
mr.
mayfield
at
the
first
arraignment
when
mr.
mayfield
upon
a
very
similar
indictment
pleaded
him
not
guilty.
the
two
incidents,
the
two
indictments
arose
out
of
the
same
transaction,
the
same
set
of
facts,
and
he
said
he
knew
enough
about
the
second
indictment
to
argue
double
jeopardy.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir,
i'm
not.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
where
he
would
have
needed
a
lawyer
more?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir,
i
think
on
any
capital
case,
the
person,
the
accused
needs
a
lawyer.
but
we
do
feel
that
he
had
a
lawyer
at
the
critical
stage
of
--
when
he
needed
him
most.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir.
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir,
the
record
is
not
--
the
record
is
silent
with
respect
to
that
as
i
recall.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir.
the
record
does
not
show
that
either.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
right.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir,
it
is
possible
that
hamilton
wouldn't
have
been
happy
with
any
lawyer.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct
sir.
if
there's
no
further
question.
thank
you
very
much.
