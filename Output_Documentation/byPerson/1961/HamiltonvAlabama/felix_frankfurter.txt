justice
felix
frankfurter
mrs.
motley,
did
not
--
do
i
understand
you
in
your
reply
to
justice
harlan's
question
to
imply
that
there
is
no
other
question
before
this
court
but
the
constitutional
significance
to
be
derived
from
mr.
mayfield
or
to
be
based
on
mr.
mayfield's
own
affidavit,
namely,
that
although
he
was
aware,
i
don't
know
how
he
--
if
that's
what
they
--
as
the
attorney
general
would
indicate,
although
mr.
mayfield
said
he
knew
of
the
indictment
before
it
was
handed
down
by
the
grand
jury,
that
after
it
was
handed
down,
he
knew
of
his
place,
that
he
knew
the
effect
--
he
was
aware
of
the
indictment
and
the
arraignment
thereon,
and
that
he
was
aware
of
the
indictment,
meaning
he
--
i
should
think
a
fair
reading
means
not
merely
that
he
knew
there
was
an
indictment,
that
he
knew
that
there
was
--
what
was
in
it,
that's
subject
to
controversy,
i
suppose.
that
he
knew
all
the
circumstances
of
the
reindictment,
the
prospective
arraignment
that
he
purposely
abstained
from
being
present
at
the
arraignment
for
whatever
reasons.
that
the
arraignment
came
and
the
plea
of
not
guilty
was
made
and
he
swear
that
he
would've
made
the
same
plea.
now,
there's
nothing
else
in
the
case,
is
there,
mrs.
motley
than
what
consequences
--
constitutional
consequences
are
to
be
drawn
from
those
circumstances?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
need
to
imply
a
view
on
that
subject,
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
the
fact
that
mr.
mayfield
wasn't
present
at
the
arraignment,
in
the
plea?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
would
you
mind
just
stating
what
the
basis
of
that
claim
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
totally
different
claim,
isn't
it?
or
is
it
tied
up
with
his
non-appearance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
wanted
to
bring
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
impression
that
you
--
you
didn't
mean
to,
i
take
it.
but
i
got
the
impression
that
you
acceded
to
justice
harlan's
suggestion,
is
that
the
issue
before
us
in
addition
to
that?
you
say
--
you're
present
answer
says
in
effect,
have
had
mr.
mayfield
been
present,
that
he
said
not
guilty
for
my
client.
and
that
first
point,
that
there's
no
qualification
to
the
duty
to
be
present
or
to
protect
the
right
to
be
protected
in
being
present,
you
say
that
the
proceedings
as
such
in
their
entirety
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
violates
due
process
in
the
--
perhaps,
procedure
and
sentencing,
isn't
that
a
fair
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
what
the
reason
is
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
were
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
you
--
are
you
suggesting
to
the
court
that
you
must
drop
down
the
assumption
that
this
--
this
counsel
was
so
callous,
so
indifferent,
and
that's
why
he
didn't
appear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
is
it
part
of
your
case
also,
that
there
was
in
effect
no
representation
of
counsel
to
the
scottsboro
cases,
very
different
circumstance,
in
effect
because
in
--
because
its
--
the
counsel
appointed
was
quite
indifferent
to
his
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
make
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
me,
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
in
these
cases
where
all
the
facts
have
to
be
taken
into
account.
whether
representation
(inaudible)
--
was
ineffective
because
the
man
was
ill-equipped
to
defend
or
whether
the
man
was
disregardful
of
his
duty
and
was
--
the
word
i
used
was
callous,
do
you
say
he
was
callous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
what
you're
thinking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
what
is
the
mail
--
what
--
what
is
the
allegation
with
reference
to
the
person
who
was
named?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
--
is
that
a
vulnerable
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
difference
isn't
there
between
a
general
allegation
about
--
i've
been
deprived
of
the
constitutional
right
and
setting
forth
facts
in
this
case
to
be
able
to
do
your
own
acceptance
of
it,
that
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel
at
arraignment,
and
then
making
the
contention
that
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
that
is
an
indispensible
requisite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
an
indispensible
requisite
and
he
doesn't
have
to
show
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
here
because
that
question
is
raised
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
that
form.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
this
isn't
nearly
a
question
of
--
one
of
allegation,
one
of
--
this
isn't
a
pleading
question
here,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
the
allegation
but
whether
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
in
a
capital
case,
there
is
a
requirement
of
presence
of
counsel.
if
that's
the
constitutional
requirement
and
he's
alleged
all
that
is
within
that
requirement
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unless
the
state
contests
it,
and
on
the
issue
of
facts
as
in
the
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
alleges,
if
it
--
if
it
had
been
--
suppose
it
had
been
settled
out
that
counsel
requisite
at
arraignment
in
a
capital
case,
then
if
a
man
say
that
he
wasn't
present,
then
he
sufficiently
come
within
the
requirements
of
your
court,
doesn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
injury
derived
from
the
fact
that
counsel
wasn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
present,
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
being
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
because
you
conceive
injury
to
be
indispensible
to
the
existence
of
our
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
case
before
us
isn't
a
case
where
under
state
law,
arraignment
is
a
mere
formality,
as
you've
indicated
a
little
while
ago,
meaning
by
that,
i
don't
know
whether
any
state
deal
with
the
hypothesis
which
i'm
about
to
give.
meaning
by
that
that
the
state
has
a
statute
which
says
at
all
arraignment,
a
plea
of
not
guilty
is
to
be
assumed
to
be
entered,
and
every
question
of
law
either
attacking
the
indictment
for
insufficiency
or
for
the
makeup
of
the
grand
jury
or
for
whatnot,
prejudice
of
the
judge,
defense
of
insanity,
alibi
whatnot,
all
defenses
are
completely
opened
and
must
be
initiated
when
the
case
is
called
for
trial.
we
haven't
got
that
kind
of
a
case,
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
while
every
possible
offense
--
and
for
all
i
know,
even
they
attack
upon
the
indictment
or
i
don't
--
myself
see
it,
in
the
way
in
which
modern
indictments
have
(inaudible)
that
there
is
any
basis
here
for
it,
but
that's
a
question
of
local
law.
but
there
is
a
difference
here
and
that
as
to
some
defenses,
there
--
they
may
be
raised
later,
but
on
the
whole,
they
must
be
raised
mandatorily
at
the
arraignment,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
haven't
got
a
mere
formality
here
and
the
case
before
the
court
isn't
a
question
--
isn't
a
case
of
mere
formality
requiring
an
abstract,
absolute
ruling
as
to
whether
every
kind
of
an
arraignment,
you
must
have
a
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
if
something
is
automatically
done,
i
don't
know
it
could
be
done.
if
--
then,
you've
got
--
and
one
may
say
“mere
formality”
meaning
it
has
no
substance
at
all
and
not
in
the
remotest
or
wildest
imagination
can
any
harm
come.
but
that
isn't
this
case,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
just
for
my
own
information
state
as
to
what
was
in
the
record
on
this
coram
nobis
proceeding
that
wasn't
before
your
supreme
court
on
the
appeal
on
the
merits?
i'm
not
suggesting
it
had
any
significance.
i
just
would
like
to
know
without
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
having
to
go
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
weren't
all
these
points
raised?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i'm
just
looking
at
the
petition
for
certiorari
when
it
came
here
by
state
counsel
--
that
was
all
before
us
on
the
petition,
therefore,
presumably,
it
was
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
representations
that
are
now
made
or
have
made
at
the
time
though
the
court
felt
it
couldn't
go
into
it,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
were
made,
weren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
made,
all
these
factors
set
forth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
imply
any
legal
significance,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
we
could
well
view
--
we
could
well
have
it
--
assume
that
that
was
a
state
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
denied
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
didn't
that
case
come
up
in
a
different
way,
namely,
whether
that
original
conviction
could
be
taken
into
account
in
a
recidivist
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
was
that.
that
it
--
mainly,
the
question
of
subsequent
--
he
was
up
for
--
on
a
subsequent
--
for
a
subsequent
crime.
and
the
question
was
whether
the
prior
conviction
could
be
deemed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could've
led
to
(voice
overlap)
sentence,
because
he
was
a
recidivist.
in
other
words,
collaterally,
the
whole
thing
was
sought
to
be
opened
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it
might
have
been
raised?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
it
is
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
--
how
many
hours
where
he
--
total
act
--
the
total
trial.
how
long
was
the
proceeding
in
court
at
the
trial
actually
going
on?
do
you
know
mr.
attorney
general?
justice
felix
frankfurter
11?
justice
felix
frankfurter
4:10.
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
11
to
one?
that's
two
hours?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
less
than
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
alleged
victim
was
not
called,
was
she?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
there
was
no
conflict?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
what
is
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
understanding
of
what
actually
took
place,
as
one
could
find
if
one
read
the
record,
which
i
haven't
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
you
--
you
have
of
course
read
the
minutes
of
the
trial.
what
kind
of
a
charge
would
you
--
you
didn't
have
to
describe
the
charge
that
(inaudible)
the
jury,
whether
an
extended
charge
or
just
abstract
legal
oppositions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
whether
we
have
the
minutes
of
the
trial
here.
do
you
happen
to
have
them
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
if
--
if
there's
need
for
--
some
of
us
would
like
to
see
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
pages
are
the
minutes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
of
the
charge
--
but,
is
that
the
whole
--
is
that
the
whole
minutes
of
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
testimony
also.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
clerk
is
--
our
clerk
is
looking
it
up.
if
we
have
it
--
if
we
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
make
it
part
of
the
--
was
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
were
--
you
were
going
to
expound
what
your
view
was
regarding
this
conflict
--
this
conflict
between
hamilton
and
mr.
mayfield.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
took
place
in
open
court,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
further
--
any
further
open
conflict
between
or
any
further
incident
regarding
the
retention
of
this
man
as
his
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
judge
on
the
basis
of
hamilton's
remarks
about
his
lawyer
which
--
that
“he
isn't
my
lawyer.”
that's
certainly
susceptible
of
more
than
one
meaning
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning,
i
didn't
choose
him,
you
chose
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
a
judge
out
of
extreme
caution
of
sentiment
or
whatnot
thought
it
would
be
--
we
better
not
try
this
case
in
that
situation
and
had
--
he
would
have
had
to
call
it
a
mistrial
because
the
jury
has
already
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
ran
the
risk
of
double
jeopardy
by
improperly
putting
them
to
a
trial
but
waive
all
that.
suppose
he
wanted
to
have
a
new
trial
or
another
trial,
what
would
that
involve
in
the
county
in
alabama
in
which
this
case
was
being
tried?
could
he
try
it
the
next
--
could
he
--
could
he
call
the
case,
put
it
off
the
next
day,
and
get
a
new
jury?
or
would
he
require
time?
where
was
this
tried,
mr.
mentz?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
read
this
--
going
through
this,
what
took
place
after
the
court
got
through
over
this
charge,
apparently
when
he
was
through,
the
court
asked
the
--
hamilton,
in
addressing
hamilton
himself:
are
you
satisfied
with
the
court's
charge?
he
had
to
ask
his
lawyer,
he'd
ask
both
sides.
and
then
the
defendant
evidently,
double
jeopardy
was
strong
in
his
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
makes
that
remark
to
the
court.
the
court:
you
misunderstood
--
stand.
i
just
took
about
--
but
since
you
didn't
want
your
lawyer
to
help
you,
since
you
didn't
want
your
lawyer
to
help
you,
i
asked
you
if
you
had
any
exceptions
of
the
law,
that
statement
that
you've
read
so
that
--
i
think
there
is
--
it
means,
number
one,
to
what
i've
read,
namely
that
evidently
hamilton
was
not
happy
with
mr.
mayfield.
the
judge
was
taking
care
of
that
situation
or
rather
keeping
that
in
mind
all
the
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
litigants
have
been
known
to
have
that
attitude,
done
professionally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mrs.
motley,
i
was
taking
your
brief
and
i
was
interested
to
find
--
my
eyes
fell
on
your
--
in
cf.
snyder
against
massachusetts,
what's
--
what
comfort
do
you
get
out
of
that
case
on
page
20?
i
should
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
25.
i
should
think
that
page
contradicts
the
uncritical
observation
that
a
defendant
must
be
represented
at
every
stage
throughout
the
case
because
that
case
holds
just
the
opposite,
namely
that
the
defendant's
lawyer
need
be
--
needn't
be
present
when
the
jury
views
the
scene.
that's
--
that
what
the
case
decides,
i
think
i'm
right
mrs.
motley
that
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
means
that
you
recognize
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
--
so
what
do
you
do
with
it
and
how
do
you
compare
it?
namely,
that's
the
case,
the
decision
in
a
murder
case,
that
counsel
need
not
be
present
at
every
stage
of
a
trial,
of
the
proceeding.
that's
what
the
snyder
case
stands
for.
would
that
turn
the
heart
of
mr.
justice
cardozo
writing
the
opinion
for
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
after
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
take
your
time.
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
