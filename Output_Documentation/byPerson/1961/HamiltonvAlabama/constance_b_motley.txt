ms.
constance
b.
motley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
title
28,
united
states
code
section
13
--
section
1257
(3),
petitioner
having
asserted
below
in
here
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
rights
asserted
below
and
here
are
rights
guaranteed
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
specifically
the
unqualified
right
to
counsel
in
every
stage
of
the
capital
case
and
the
right
to
a
trial
on
a
capital
charge
which
afforded
the
petitioner
a
fair
hearing.
now,
this
case
is
here
for
the
second
time.
petitioner
first
sought
to
have
this
court
review
his
case
during
the
october
1959
term
when
he
petitioned
this
court
to
grant
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
affirming
his
conviction
on
a
charge
of
burglary
with
intent
to
ravish
for
which
he
had
been
sentenced
to
death.
in
that
petition,
the
petitioner
claimed,
as
he
now
claims,
that
he
had
been
denied
due
process
of
law
in
that
he
had
not
had
counsel
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
and
in
that
he
was
denied
the
fundamentals
of
a
fair
trial.
on
his
appeal
from
his
conviction
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
he
made
this
same
claim.
now
with
respect
to
the
first
claims,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
ruled
that
it
had
no
quarrel
with
the
petitioner's
claims
right
to
counsel
in
a
capital
case
where
the
accused
is
unable
to
afford
counsel
and
the
petitioner's
claim
of
right
to
counsel
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
but
the
court
ruled
that
these
principles
were
without
application
to
the
case
before
it
because
the
record
on
its
face
read
that
the
petitioner
was
represented
by
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
arraignment.
petitioner
sought
to
prove
by
reference
to
a
certified
copy
of
the
bench
notes
of
the
trial
judge
that
he
had
not
in
fact
then
represented
by
a
counsel
at
the
time
of
his
arraignment.
but
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
ruled
that
the
state
law
precluded
impeachment
of
the
minute
entry
of
record
which
showed
that
counsel
was
present
at
the
time
of
arraignment
and
at
the
time
of
trial.
in
his
october
petition
to
this
court
from
that
ruling
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
petitioner
asked
this
court
to
find
as
a
fact
that
he
did
not
have
counsel
at
the
time
of
arraignment,
that
this
deprived
him
of
due
process
of
law,
and
that
the
conduct
of
the
trial
in
view
of
the
representations
of
this
petitioner
by
his
court-appointed
counsel
among
other
things
did
not
make
due
process
requirements.
now,
in
opposition
to
that
first
petition
for
certiorari
in
1959,
the
state
of
alabama
filed
a
brief
in
opposition
thereto.
and
on
pages
five
and
six
of
that
brief,
the
state
said
this,
“the
burden
is
not
on
the
state
of
alabama
to
explain
the
fancy
inconsistency
as
to
why
the
minute
entry
of
the
record
shows
that
the
defendant
did
have
counsel
at
his
arraignment
and
yet
his
trial
counsel
was
apparently
appointed
three
days
later.”
actually,
the
counsel
in
the
particular
case
have
appointed
quite
some
time
prior
to
the
official
judgment
entry
to
defend
the
petitioner
on
a
previous
indictment
and
remained
assigned
as
counsel
to
the
defendant
throughout
and
including
the
day
of
arraignment
on
the
second
indictment.
the
two
entries
of
judgment
are
not
in
conflict
and
the
statement
by
the
petitioner
that
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
counsel
at
the
time
of
his
arraignment
is
pure
conjecture
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner's
counsel.
then
alabama
pointed
out
that
however,
petitioner
still
had
available
to
him
another
remedy
to
attack
the
judgment
entry
in
this
case
with
extrinsic
matter.
that
method
it
said
was
by
writ
of
error
coram
nobis.
this
court
refused
to
review
that
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
affirming
his
conviction.
now
after
that,
the
petitioner
then
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
a
petition
for
leave
to
file
a
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
in
the
trial
court.
in
that
petition
he
alleged
that
he
had
been
indicted
on
november
9th,
1956
for
the
crime
of
burglary
in
the
nighttime
with
intent
to
steal.
arraigned
on
this
charge
on
january
4th,
1957
at
which
time
his
counsel
mr.
mayfield
was
appointed
and
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty.
trial
was
set
for
january
14th,
1957
but
was
passed
four
times
until
april
24th,
1957
when
the
case
was
now
crossed
on
recommendation
of
the
solicitor.
now
in
this
petition
for
leave
to
file
a
writ
of
error
coram
nobis,
petitioner
also
pointed
out
that
on
february
12,
1957
before
the
first
indictment
was
nolle
pros,
he
was
indicted
the
second
time
by
the
grand
jury.
this
time
he
was
indicted
for
burglary
with
intent
to
steal
in
one
count
and
burglary
with
intent
to
ravish.
he
was
arraigned
on
this
second
indictment
on
march
1st,
1957
at
which
time
he
again
pleaded
not
guilty
but
this
time
without
the
aid,
advice
or
representation
of
counsel.
counsel
is
not
appointed
for
him
he
alleged
until
march
4th,
1957.
now
this
allegation
was
supported
by
the
affidavit
of
the
petitioner's
trial
counsel
which
was
attached
to
his
petition
in
which
he
stated
that
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge,
information
and
belief,
he
was
not
present
at
the
arraignment
on
march
1st
and
that
he
did
not
advise
or
consult
with
the
defendant.
in
addition
to
the
affidavit
which
was
submitted
by
the
petitioner
(inaudible)
counsel,
the
state
of
alabama
submitted
an
affidavit
from
the
trial
counsel
in
which
he
again
said
that
he
had
been
appointed
to
represent
the
petitioner
with
respect
to
his
first
indictment,
later
nolle
pros,
and
that
on
march
4th,
1957,
he
was
appointed
to
represent
petitioner
with
respect
to
the
second
indictment
that
is
three
days
after
the
second
arraignment.
that
he
knew
of
the
indictment
prior
to
its
being
returned
by
the
grand
jury,
that
he
was
aware
of
the
second
indictment
and
arraignment
which
he
stated
occurred
on
march
1st,
1957
that
he
considered
himself
as
representing
the
defendant.
and
that
the
arraignment
was
done
with
his
knowledge
and
consent
although
he
was
not
present.
he
alleged
that
he
would
not
have
entered
any
different
plea
from
the
plea
of
guilty
entered
by
petitioner
had
he
been
at
the
arraignment,
and
finally
he
alleged
that
he
considered
the
arraignment
a
mere
formality,
since
the
same
plea
would
have
been
entered
which
was
entered
on
the
first
arraignment,
and
that
this
was
his
reason
for
not
representing
petitioner
on
march
1st
on
his
second
arraignment.
now
in
addition
to
these
two
affidavits,
there
was
a
third
affidavit.
this
one
was
filed
by
the
deputy
second
solicitor
who
prosecuted
the
case
in
which
he
alleged
that
he
had
spoken
to
the
mr.
mayfield,
the
petitioner's
court-appointed
counsel
informing
him
that
there
no
indictment
was
being
procured
and
later
told
him
that
the
new
two
count
indictments
had
been
returned
and
that
the
petitioner
would
be
arraigned.
however,
none
of
these
affidavits
indicates
whether
mr.
mayfield
actually
sought
the
second
indictment
with
the
more
serious
crime.
the
prosecutor
alleged
that
the
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that
is
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
more
reprehensible
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
sort
of
a
crime.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
the
prosecutor
alleged
that
the
appointment
of
the
lawyer
on
march
4th
was
necessary
if
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that
is
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
the
statute
says
with
intent
to
steal
or
intent
to
commit
a
felony.
now
in
this
indictment
he
was
charged
with
intent
to
ravish
which
is
nowhere
defined
on
the
statute.
but
the
statute
does
of
course
forbid
rape
but
he
was
not
charged
in
the
words
of
the
statute
with
intent
--
to
commit
a
felony.
he
was
charged
with
intent
to
ravish.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
with
intent
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
to
steal.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony
and
with
intent
to
steal.
now
as
i
--
i'm
sorry.
was
that
all
your
--
as
i
started
to
say,
the
state
said
that
the
reason
for
the
appointment
on
march
4th
was
necessary
in
order
to
ensure
that
this
lawyer
get
his
fee
of
$50
or
$100,
and
that
the
record
had
to
show
it
so
that
he
could
be
paid
when
the
trial
was
over,
and
this
was
the
reason
for
the
subsequent
appointment.
now
upon
considering
petitioner's
application
in
which
all
of
these
facts
were
alleged
for
leave
to
file
a
writ
of
error
coram
nobis,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held
that
the
petitioner
had
followed
the
proper
procedure.
it
also
found
as
a
fact
that
petitioner
was
not
represented
by
counsel
at
time
of
arraignment.
it
ruled
that
it
was
not
bound
by
the
minute
entries
that
had
been
on
the
appeal
and
so
they
could
find
this
as
a
fact.
the
alabama
court
then
held
that
the
law
of
the
state
placed
upon
the
trial
court
the
obligation
to
see
that
the
petitioner
here
had
counsel
because
this
was
a
capital
offense
and
that
he
had
such
counsel
before
he
was
arraigned
and
called
upon
to
plea.
it
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
decision
in
alabama
expressly
so
ruling
but
that
this
had
been
the
almost
uniform
practice
of
the
circuit
courts
of
alabama
for
many
years
and
that
the
very
purpose
of
the
statute
would
seem
to
dictate
such
action.
it
also
held
that
the
petitioner
should
have
been
represented
by
counsel
at
arraignment,
but
refused
to
grant
the
petition
on
the
ground
that
this
fact
standing
alone
was
not
prima
facie
just
ground
for
granting
the
thing.
the
alabama
court
acknowledged
this
court's
decision
of
course
in
powell
against
alabama,
287
u.s.
45
and
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
not
a
right
confined
to
representation
during
the
trial
on
the
merits
citing
this
court's
decision
in
moore
against
michigan,
that's
355
u.s.
155.
however,
it
ruled
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process
since
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
show
that
he
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
absence
of
counsel
at
his
arraignment.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
no.i
don't
believe
it
did.
i
think
the
only
thing
it
found
as
the
fact
was
that
he
was
not
present
on
march
1st,
1957
when
the
man
was
arraigned
on
the
second
indictment.
it
referred
to
his
affidavit
and
said
that
he
pointed
out
that
he
would
not
have
entered
any
different
plea
had
he
been
present
at
the
time
as
i
recall
but
i
don't
recall
any
specific
finding
as
you
suggest.
the
alabama
court
ruled
that
the
petitioner's
counsel
had
been
appointed
three
days
after
arraignment
whose
competence
was
not
questioned
and
who
was
searched
in
an
affidavit
as
i've
just
said
that
he
would
not
have
entered
a
different
plea.
finally,
that
court
ruled
that
there
is
no
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
suggestion.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
not
guilty,
that's
right.
finally,
that
court
ruled
that
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
guilty
plea
interposed
an
arraignment
in
absence
of
counsel
prevented
the
filing
of
any
other
plea
or
motion.
now
this
court
--
this
petitioner
now
asked
this
court
to
review
this
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
the
record
filed
in
this
case
with
this
new
petitioner
causes
supplemented
by
the
record
which
was
filed
here
in
1959
with
the
first
petition
for
certiorari.
and
petitioner
asked
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
that
record
as
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
might
have
done
upon
its
review
of
petitioner's
request
for
leave
to
file
a
writ
of
error
coram
nobis.
now
this
record
shows
that
the
petitioner,
an
indigent
negro
was
convicted
by
the
courts
of
alabama
of
burglary
with
intent
to
ravish
and
sentenced
to
death
on
april
23rd,
1957.
now
the
testimony
on
the
trial
i
think
is
far
from
clear
but
it
shows
that
the
petitioner
was
convicted
on
the
night
of
october
12th,
1956
or
the
early
morning
hours
of
october
13th,
1956.
at
that
time,
petitioner
was
found
in
the
bedroom
of
an
elderly
white
woman
in
ensley,
alabama
by
the
woman's
grandson
by
marriage
who
live
in
the
same
house
who
testified
that
petitioner
was
indecently
exposed
when
found.
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
was
summoned
into
the
house
by
the
woman
who
gave
him
the
impression
that
she
had
been
robbed
and
sought
help.
he
testified
that
he
could
not
understand
her
because
he
spoke
with
a
foreign
accent,
and
that
whenever
he
attempted
to
leave,
she
prevented
him
because
she
insisted
on
his
helping
her,
whatever
her
plight
might
have
been.
the
grandchildren
called
the
police
who
arrested
the
petitioner.
there
was
some
testimony
concerning
the
lock
on
the
door
of
the
room
which
petitioner
was
found
--
in
which
petitioner
was
found,
a
door
which
led
from
the
porch
into
the
room.
but
it
was
not
demonstrated
that
this
lock
had
been
broken.
it
appears
that
while
the
windows
and
doors
had
been
secured
and
so
forth,
the
door
in
the
porch
was
open.
in
addition,
although
there
was
testimony
that
the
petitioner
was
indecently
exposed,
mrs.
giangrosso,
the
elderly
woman
who
was
the
alleged
intended
victim
of
the
rape
did
not
testify.
petitioner's
counsel
called
her
for
testimony
during
the
trial
but
since
she
had
not
been
subpoenaed
she
did
not
appear
and
no
effort
was
made
to
secure
her
attendance.
there
was
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
rape,
violence
or
physical
injury
at
any
time
which
occurred
to
alleged
intended
victim
or
anyone
else,
neither
was
there
evidence
that
petitioner
had
any
weapons,
burglary
tools
or
the
like.
now,
the
trial
of
this
capital
case
have
started
at
11
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
terminated
at
4:10
in
the
afternoon
with
an
hour
and
40
minutes
for
lunch.
when
the
case
came
on
for
trial
the
petitioner
got
up
and
said
to
the
trial
court,
“this
is
not
my
lawyer,
he
was
appointed
by
the
court.”
the
trial
counsel
then
got
up
and
asked
to
withdraw
from
the
case.
all
of
these
occurred
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
because
petitioner
had
indicated
his
dissatisfaction
with
his
counsel,
the
court
didn't
inquire
as
to
the
basis
of
it.
he
merely
asked
him
if
he
had
other
counsels
and
he
said
no.
the
court
then
invited
the
petitioner
to
participate
in
his
own
defense
and
said
that
he
could
ask
questions
after
the
counsel
had
completed
examinations.
and
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
petitioner
made
a
bungling,
inept
effort
to
defend
himself.
he
interrupted
the
court
and
argued
with
witnesses
for
which
he
was
reprimanded
by
the
court
throughout
the
trial
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
the
trial
concluded
with
a
lengthy
charge
to
the
jury
which
nowhere
defined
intent
to
ravish
and
to
which
no
objections
were
taken
by
the
trial
counsel.
petitioner
himself
argued
to
the
jury
but
as
he
said
in
his
own
words,
he
did
not
understand
the
charge.
the
verdict
of
course
was
guilty
and
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
death.
upon
this
review,
petitioner
claims
first
that
his
right
to
counsel
in
a
capital
case
may
not
be
qualified
as
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
qualified
it,
by
superimposing
upon
this
right
a
requirement
that
he
shows
some
qualitative
disadvantage
flowing
from
the
denial
of
the
right
to
counsel
at
time
of
arraignment.
petitioner
also
claims
that
even
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
that
a
showing
of
disadvantage
is
required,
the
record
in
this
case
demonstrates
that
the
petitioner
was
denied
a
fair
hearing.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
mr.
mayfield
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
i
would
like
to
clarify
something,
your
honor
and
that
is
that
mr.
mayfield
was
not
actually
appointed
until
after
the
petitioner
had
been
arraigned
because
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
he
says
--
that's
right.
he
says
in
his
affidavit
that
he
was
not
present,
that
he
had
not
consulted
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
with
him
prior
to
that
second
arraignment,
so
that
he
was
not
his
lawyer,
we'd
say,
at
the
time
of
the
arraignment.
he
was
his
lawyer
on
the
trial
and
he
was
appointed
after
the
arraignment.
and
our
claim
is
that
he
had
--
this
petitioner
had
an
absolute
right
to
counsel
at
the
time
of
arraignment,
and
that
that
abridgement
of
that
right
denies
him
due
process
of
law.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
he
said
he
considered
the
mere
formality
and
that
he
wouldn't
have
entered
any
other
plea
of
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
i
think
the
latter,
your
honor,
is
certainly
our
claim
that
he
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
at
the
time
of
the
arraignment,
let's
say
a
right
to
counsel
in
a
capital
case
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings
and
at
this
crucial
stage,
we
say,
he
was
not
represented
by
a
counsel
and
that
fact
in
and
of
itself
denied
him
due
process
of
law.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
sir.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that
was
two-count,
burglary
with
intent
to
steal
and
burglary
with
intent
to
ravish.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
he
did.
the
testimony
was
the
grandson
then
went
back
into
his
bedroom
and
came
back
with
a
gun
and
then
he
gave
it
to
his
wife
while
he
went
to
get
the
police
and
the
man
stayed
there
all
of
that
time
and
waited
until
the
police
came
back.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
and
that
he
was
there
when
the
police
came.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
the
petitioner's
conduct
at
the
trial
seem
to
evidenced
that
he
--
his
behavior
was
irrational
and
what
we
have
said
in
here
was
that
at
the
time
of
arraignment
was
the
time
to
answer
a
plea
of
not
only
not
guilty
but
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
not
being
entered
at
that
time,
he
lost
an
absolute
right
to
enter
it,
and
it
then
became
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
trial
court.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
i
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
our
second
claim
is
that
even
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument,
that
the
right
to
counsel
in
a
capital
case
is
qualified
as
the
alabama
court
says
it
is,
that
you
might
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
no,
i'm
just
saying
what
our
second
claim
is,
that
our
second
claim
is
--
even
if
that's
true,
what
the
alabama
court
has
held
as
to
this
right,
this
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
did
not
get
a
fair
hearing
as
contemplated
by
due
process.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
yes.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
it's
tied
up
when
he's
not
appearing.
but
also
at
the
second
claim,
in
that
we
say
that,
look
at
the
trial
and
look
at
the
representation
that
this
man
had.
you
say,
alabama
argued
that
whatever
went
wrong
at
the
arraignment,
if
he
wasn't
there,
it
could
have
been
cured
at
the
trial.
but
we
say
look
at
this
trial
and
that
nothing
could've
been
cured
at
this
trial
because
the
trial
collapsed
into
a
complete
shambles
because
the
petitioner
and
his
counsel
were
in
conflict
with
each
other,
all
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
the
petitioner
antagonized
the
court.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
that's
a
fact.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
mayfield.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
oh,
no.
no,
your
honor.
this
--
our
first
contention
is
that
this
man
was
without
counsel
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
at
the
time
he
was
arraigned.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
his
counsel
was
not
appointed
until
three
days
after
arraignment.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
we
say
that
arraignment
is
such
a
crucial
stage
in
a
capital
proceeding,
that
for
this
man
to
have
been
without
counsel,
was
in
and
of
itself
the
denial
of
due
process.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
his
reason
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
no.
we're
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
the
fact
that
he
did
not
have
counsel
at
the
time
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
of
arraignment
was
in
and
of
itself
a
denial
of
due
process
because
this
is
a
capital
case.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
he
was
i
think
throughout
the
trial,
its
clear
that
he
was
indifferent
to
his
duty
here,
that
he
didn't
represent
this
man
as
effectively
as
contemplated
by
this
court's
decision
in
powell
against
alabama.
he
didn't
even
call
the
alleged
intended
victim
of
this
intent
to
ravish.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
i
think
so.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes
sir.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
now,
as
i've
pointed
out,
the
law
in
alabama
is
clear
that
he
had
this
right
to
counsel.
and
that
the
right
was
qualified
by
alabama
by
this
ruling
which
it
has
made
that
in
order
to
show
a
denial
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
petitioner
was
found
to
show
prejudice
to
him
from
this
fact.
now,
we
say
that
the
right
to
counsel
in
a
capital
case
of
this
kind
is
so
essential
that
it
cannot
be
qualified
as
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
qualified
it.
in
so
ruling,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
relied
on
several
lower,
federal,
and
state
court
cases.
it
also
relied
upon
this
court's
decision
in
canizio
against
new
york,
327
u.s.
82,
a
noncapital
case
in
which
the
defendant
who
plead
guilty
was
not
represented
by
counsel
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
there
this
court
ruled
that
under
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
no
denial
of
due
process
had
been
shown
and
then
the
alabama
supreme
court
relied
on
two
other
decisions
of
this
court,
one,
gayes
against
new
york,
332
u.s.
145,
another
noncapital
case
in
which
it
was
shown
that
the
petitioner
waived
his
right
to
counsel.
the
same
with
the
case
of
quicksall
against
michigan,
339
u.s.660
in
a
capital
case
on
which
alabama
relied.
but,
there
again,
it
was
clear
that
the
petitioner
there
had
waived
his
right
to
counsel
so
that
the
alabama
court
did
not
have
any
decision
of
this
court
on
which
to
rely.
it
relied
upon
cases
of
this
court
which
were
either
noncapital
cases
or
cases
at
which
the
petitioner
had
actually
waived
his
right
to
counsel.
here
of
course,
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
a
capital
case
and
he
certainly
didn't
waive
his
right
to
counsel.
and
so
we
say
that
in
a
capital
case
of
this
kind,
at
every
stage,
it
is
so
essential
to
have
a
counsel
that
to
deprive
him
of
counsel
at
the
time
of
arraignment
is
in
itself
a
denial
of
due
process.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
spano
against
new
york,
360
u.s.
315,
at
page
327,
a
case
involving
coerced
confession
in
which
the
defendant
was
without
counsel
at
the
time,
he
confessed
following
indictment.
now,
mr.
justice
stewart
said
this,
“under
our
system
of
justice,
an
indictment
is
supposed
to
be
followed
by
an
arraignment
and
trial.
at
every
stage
in
those
proceedings,
the
accused
has
an
absolute
right
to
a
lawyer's
help
if
the
case
is
one
in
which
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed”,
citing
powell
against
alabama.
what
this
court
said
in
von
moltke
against
gillies,
332
u.s.
708,
723
is
clearly
applicable
here.
arraignment,
this
court
said
is
too
important
a
step
in
a
criminal
proceeding
to
give
such
wholly
inadequate
representation.
arraignment
is
considered
so
crucial
as
step
in
a
criminal
proceeding
that
in
19
states,
the
law
provides
for
appointment
of
counsel
for
indigent
defendants
at
arraignments
in
virtually
all
felony
prosecution.
now,
in
the
appendix
to
appellee
--
to
this
petitioner's
brief,
we
have
set
forth
all
of
the
law
of
the
various
states
on
the
right
to
counsel
at
time
of
arraignment.
under
alabama
law,
arraignment
is
the
time
to
enter
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
as
we
have
pointed
out.
and
the
failure
to
answer
the
plea
at
that
time
means
that
your
right
to
do
so
is
lost.
you
may
then
make
a
motion
which
is
then
wholly
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
so
ruled.
so
that
an
arraignment
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
he
could
have.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
but
you
say
it
was
not
an
absolute
right.
he
lost
that
because
he
didn't
make
it
at
arraignment
and
he
didn't
make
it
we
say
because
he
had
no
counsel.
he
was
not
himself
educated
enough
to
make
any
such
plea.
he
didn't
know
what
could've
been
done
except
to
plea
guilty
or
not
guilty.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right,
it
does
not.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
it
must
be
specially
pleaded.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes
sir.
and
it's
also
the
time
under
section
279
of
title
15
alabama
code,
you
must
enter
your
plea
in
abatement
before
you
plea
to
the
indictment,
and
that
of
course
as
a
practical
matter
is
done
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
the
only
person
named
in
the
indictment
was
jacob
c.milko,
this
was
the
grandson.
and
the
--
mrs.
giangrosso,
the
elderly
woman
who
was
the
alleged
intended
victim
who
never
testified
never
even
appeared
at
this
trial
was
not
even
named
in
the
indictment.
that's
what
we
meant
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
oh
yes,
certainly.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
the
allegation
is
this
--
that
in
the
night
time
with
intent
to
steal,
the
petitioner,
referring
to
the
petitioner,
did
break
into
and
entered
the
inhabitant
dwelling
house
of
jacob
c.
milko,
a
person
lodged
therein.
and
then
in
this
same
thing,
in
the
next
paragraph,
in
the
night
time
with
intent
to
ravish
did
break
in
to
and
entered
the
inhabitant
dwelling
house
of
jacob
c.
milko,
a
person
lodged
therein.
they
never
even
mentioned
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
i
would
think
so,
yes,
under
the
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
alabama
law.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
say
that
we'd
be
happy
to
leave
our
copy
of
the
record
on
the
previous
hearing
which
contains
the
testimony
on
the
trial.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
and
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
i
just
like
to
point
to
one
page
of
that
testimony,
which
is
page
78,
i
guess
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
78,
and
underneath
it,
it
says,
64,
i
don't
know
which
is
the
right
number,
that's
two
numbers
on
each
page
but
the
top
number
is
78.
in
the
middle
of
that
page,
the
court
said
this
to
the
defendant,
“you
are
going
into
a
whole
lot
of
stuff
that
is
entirely
illegal.
and
i'll
let
you
rave
on,
now
you
are
arguing.”
this
is
what
we
meant
when
we
said
there
was
conflict
between
the
petitioner
and
the
court
during
the
trial
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
now,
there
are
other
incidences
and
we've
cited
some
in
the
brief
with
the
page
references
but
we'd
be
glad
to
leave
this
extra
copy
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
with
the
court
of
the
--
what
happened
on
the
trial.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
we
did.
and
then
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
to
one
place.
and
we,
of
course,
say
that
the
conflict
was
evidenced
in
the
very
beginning
when
the
petitioner
said,
“this
is
not
my
lawyer.”
we
think
that
the
court
had
a
duty
to
inquire
into
that
and
to
find
out
the
basis
of
the
dissatisfaction
and
to
make
some
change
in
the
situation.
if
the
counsel
has
been
present
in
the
arraignment,
the
court
might
have
at
that
time,
seen
the
conflict
between
counsel
and
the
client,
and
then
was
the
time
to
have
made
the
change
in
counsel
of
course.
but
the
lawyer
was
not
there
and
this
is
one
of
our
reason
for
saying
arraignment
is
very
important
because
this
kind
of
thing,
they
come
to
light
at
the
time
of
arraignments.
but
all
of
the
remarks
made
by
the
court
and
this
conflict
or
dissatisfaction
with
client
and
lawyer
was
all
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
what
they
concluded
of
course
was
mere
speculation.
but
we
say
this
kind
of
thing
should
not
happen
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
in
a
capital
case.
another
thing
i'd
like
to
clarify
which
was
raised
earlier
in
the
argument
with
my
--
my
opponent,
this
petitioner
never
had
a
hearing
on
his
coram
nobis
application,
permission
to
file
coram
nobis
in
the
trial
court
was
denied
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
so
there
was
no
hearing
on
it.
he
made
an
application
for
leave
to
file
a
petition
in
the
trial
court
which
is
a
procedure
in
alabama.
so
that
what
was
denied
was
the
permission
to
file
it.
now
of
course,
petitioner
says
that
arraignment
is
not
a
mere
formality.
the
arraignment
is
a
very,
very
important
step
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
in
this
case,
the
charge
shows
that
the
petitioner
here
was
presented
with
a
charge
involving
complex
legal
and
factual
issues.
as
was
pointed,
the
code
nowhere
defined
intent
to
ravish,
yet
that
was
the
charge
in
the
indictment
to
which
he
pled.
in
addition
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes
sir.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
but
i
know
that
in
alabama,
this
was
a
time
after
the
indictment
at
which
you
were
required
to
plead.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
and
to
make
a
special
plea
if
it
were
for
insanity
and
to
make
other
objections
to
the
indictment.
for
example,
objecting
to
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury.
and
there's
a
case
before
this
court,
reeves
against
alabama
in
which
a
negro
defendant
sought
to
raise
after
arraignment
the
question
of
the
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
jury.
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
ruled
that
he
should've
raised
it
at
the
arraignment
or
prior
thereto,
and
when
he
was
denied
the
right
to
do
so
by
the
trial
judge,
they
did
not
reverse
it,
because
he
had
lost
the
absolute
right
to
challenge
the
jury
by
not
having
raised
this
on
arraignment.
so
that
arraignment
in
alabama
is
not
a
mere
formality.
of
course,
as
a
practical
manner,
arraignment
also
is
the
time
to
enter
a
plea
to
lesser
crime
which
this
petitioner
could
not
have
known
and
without
a
lawyer,
he
certainly
didn't
know
that.
it
was
also
the
time
perhaps
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
and
receive
mercy,
so
there
was
no
mere
formality
about
it.
and
i
don't
recall
anything
in
this
record
which
attempts
to
explain
why
the
first
indictment
did
not
contain
the
second
count.
i
don't
see
anything
in
there.
maybe
i
overlooked
it
but
i
don't
believe
there's
any
explanation
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
what
page
is
that,
your
honor?
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
we
were
just
using
that
to
compare
the
situation
there.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
we
were
just
trying
to
point
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
well,
i'd
like
to
make
this
other
point
and
at
this
time
that
alabama
says
in
effect
when
it
cites
canizio
against
new
york
that
whatever
went
amiss
at
the
time
of
arraignment,
it
could
have
been
cured
or
was
cured
at
the
trial.
the
court
may
recall
that
in
the
canizio
case,
the
defendant
had
pled
guilty
to
a
lesser
crime
and
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel.
but
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
he
was
represented
by
counsel
and
during
a
long,
lengthy
hearing
on
that
day,
the
lawyer
considered
as
this
court
pointed
out
probably
the
advisability
of
withdrawing
that
plea
of
guilty
and
decided
against
it
because
the
record
in
that
case
showed
that
he
was,
perhaps,
guilty
of
the
greater
offense
which
was
robbery
unarmed,
whereas
he
was
permitted
to
plead
not
guilty
to
a
lesser
offense.
so
that
in
effect
in
that
case,
his
counsel
did
correct
whatever
might
have
been
wrong
by
--
as
not
being
present
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
but
in
this
case
we
say
that
no
such
thing
happened,
at
this
trial,
nothing
could
have
been
corrected.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
so
there
are
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
that's
all.
i
think
that
the
--
the
record
says
about
that
first
indictment.
i
think
there
was
an
explanation
here
that
it
was
changed
because
of
typographical
error
and
that
was
what
i
had
referenced
to
when
i
said
that
there
wasn't
anything
in
the
record
which
it
attempted
to
explain
why
there
was
a
necessity
for
changing
the
indictment,
putting
that
second
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that
--
it's
not
there.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
i
didn't
see
it.
if
it
is
there
i
didn't
see
such
explanation.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
that
is
a
lower
court
decision
of
course,
which
this
court
refused
to
review
and
i
don't
think
that
that
can
be
cited
as
authority
for
the
proposition
that
in
a
capital
case,
the
accused
is
not
entitled
to
counsel
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
it
was
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
but
it
was
not
reviewed
by
this
court.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
there
wasn't
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right,
in
that
circuit,
there
was
that
holding,
yes.
but
this
court
did
not
review
that
case,
so
that
it
can't
be
cited
as
authority
of
this
court
for
the
proposition
that
counsel
is
not
needed
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
no
sir.
as
a
recall,
the
judge
did
not
define
intent
to
ravish
in
the
charge
to
the
jury.
and
the
counsel
representing
petitioner
didn't
take
any
exception
to
that
as
i
recall.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
the
charge.
i
didn't
have
the
latter
part
rather.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
that's
what
the
court
held
on
that.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
this
case,
as
in
many
other
cases,
as
the
court
knows,
it
is
very
difficult
but
not
impossible
to
prove
that
a
counsel
was
ineffective
or
incompetent.
and
i
think
that
for
this
reason,
this
court
ought
to
require
as
the
very
minimum
objective
standard
of
procedural
due
process
which
may
be
enforced,
that
at
the
time
of
arrangement,
there
ought
to
be
some
counsel
represented
--
representing
the
petitioner
in
a
capital
case.
