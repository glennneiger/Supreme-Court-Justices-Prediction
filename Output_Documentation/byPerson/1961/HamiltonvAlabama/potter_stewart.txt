is
it
a
more
serious
crime
miss
motley?
justice
potter
stewart
under
state
law?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
more
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
perhaps
with
--
justice
potter
stewart
no
more
serious
penalty
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
least
theoretically
as
to
both.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
the
right
to
the
presence
of
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
the
--
didn't
the
alabama
court
say
in
this
or
i'm
mistaken
that
in
this
case,
he
could've
made
any
alternative
or
additional
plea
subsequent
to
the
indictment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
couldn't
be?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
state,
not
guilty
does
not
include
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
especially
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you,
but
you
stated
in
your
brief
here
somewhere
that
the
indictment
designated
as
the
only
victim
of
this
offense
is
a
man.
i
don't
find
the
indictment
in
the
set
of
record
here,
that
it's
absent,
perhaps,
am
i
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
at
least
it
would
appear
superficially
that
there
might
be
some
de
--
at
least
a
defect
in
that
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
general
mentz.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
leave
that.
as
i
understand
it,
the
petitioner
here
was
convicted
under
count
two
of
the
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
breaking
and
entering
an
inhabited
dwelling
in
the
night
time
for
the
--
to
ravish.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
is
ravish
--
to
ravish
a
felony
under
your
alabama
law?
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
statute
says
--
to
steal
or
to
commit
a
felony.
justice
potter
stewart
ravish
is
not
a
felony,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
there's
good
many
other
felonies
too,
but
is
ravish
mentioned
as
a
felony?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
arguable
that
this
indictment
was
technically
defective,
isn't
it
at
least?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
wasn't
the
--
i
thought
the
first
time
on
direct
appeal,
the
supreme
court
probably
self
concluded
by
the
minute
entry.
justice
potter
stewart
but
showed
that
he
was
represented
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
turned
up
on
coram
nobis
where
the
minute
entry
was
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
the
affidavits
came
in
to
show
that
in
fact
he
was
not
represented.
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
motley,
there's
no
question
about
--
that
in
case,
when
we're
talking
about
arraignment,
we're
talking
to
the
procedure
--
about
the
procedure
that
follows
after
an
indictment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
where
there's
a
hearing
be
--
in
an
open
court
in
--
whether
defendant
at
that
time
pleads
guilty
or
not
guilty
or
files
objections
to
the
indictment
or
makes
other
motions
because
--
i
asked
that
question
because
in
literature,
including
a
good
--
many
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
that
word
“arraignment”
is
used
sometimes
to
mean
a
variety
of
things.
it's
used
to
mean
a
preliminary
hearing
prior
to
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
such
procedures
out
in
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
plead
to
the
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
or
otherwise
object
--
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
motley,
why
the
first
indictment
was
quashed.
i'm
looking
on
page
6
of
the
record,
it
says
nolle
prosequi
to
faulty
indictment
on
(inaudible)
period,
and
some
other
language
i
can't
quite
read.
it's
in
(inaudible)
handwriting.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
capital
case.
