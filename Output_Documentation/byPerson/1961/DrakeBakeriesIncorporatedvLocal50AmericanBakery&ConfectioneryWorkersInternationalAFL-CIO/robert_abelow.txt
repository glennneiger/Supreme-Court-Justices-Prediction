mr.
robert
abelow
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
court
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
judgment
affirmed
an
order
of
the
district
court
which
stayed
the
plaintiff's
action
for
damages
brought
against
the
union
pursuant
to
section
301
(a)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
the
company
claiming
that
the
union
had
breached
the
no-strike
clause
in
its
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
briefly
and
by
way
of
background,
drake
is
a
wholesale
bakery
company
in
new
york
and
has
a
plant
in
brooklyn
which
employs
approximately
200
members
of
the
bakery
workers
union.
new
year's
day
in
1960
fell
on
a
friday.
and
in
order
to
get
freshly
baked
products
to
consuming
public
on
monday
and
tuesday,
drake
scheduled
production
for
the
saturday
following
new
year's
day,
january
2nd
and
allowed
the
employees
to
take
off
thursday
instead.
in
that
way,
they
were
able
to
get
to
the
consuming
public
of
baked
products
that
were
two
days
old
instead
of
four
or
five
days
old.
the
union
objected
to
this
and
made
it
clear
to
management
that
they
would
come
in
on
thursday
but
they
wouldn't
come
in
on
fri
--
on
saturday
because
that
was,
as
they
said,
a
violation
of
past
practice
and
the
employees
had
the
right
to
anticipate
a
three-day
weekend.
and
making
good
their
threat
that
the
employees
would
not
come
in
on
saturday,
85%
of
them
didn't
come
in.
the
handful
of
employees
who
did
respond
to
the
company's
request
for
work
was
insufficient
to
the
get
the
plant
started.
we
closed
the
plant.
we
lost
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
production
and
sales
and
a
considerable
amount
of
costumer
goodwill.
now,
for
the
purpose
of
this
appeal,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
discuss
the
merits
of
the
union's
claim
with
regard
to
past
practice.
because
i
understand
the
decisions,
though
the
merits
of
the
underlying
dispute
are
matters
that
will
be
taken
up
by
the
trial
court
upon
a
full
hearing.
what
--
what
has
happen
here
is
that
instead
of
utilizing
the
available
contractual
grievance
and
arbitration
machinery
with
regard
to
this
underlying
dispute
of
schedule,
the
union
instigated,
encouraged,
it
advised
its
employees
that
they
did
not
have
to
report
on
saturday
and
in
fact
they
didn't.
they
made
good
their
threat
that
there
would
be
a
strike.
now,
drake
promptly
instituted
an
action
under
301
(a)
and
the
union
just
as
properly
made
a
motion
to
stay
the
action
on
the
ground
that
the
issue
was
arbitrable.
and
the
case
came
before
chief
judge
sylvester
ryan
of
the
district
court
in
new
york
and
the
motion
was
granted.
thereupon,
drake
took
an
appeal
and
a
panel
of
--
of
the
judges
of
the
court
appeals
consisting
of
judges
swan,
lumbard
and
moore
unanimously
reversed,
deciding
that
the
breach
of
the
no-strike
clause
was
not
covered
by
the
arbitration
clause.
that
the
union
had
flaunted
the
grievance
and
arbitration
machinery
and
hence
the
use
--
the
union's
motion
for
a
stay
had
been
improperly
granted.
then
the
union
moved
for
a
rehearing
en
banc
and
that
application
was
granted.
and
at
the
time
the
rehearing
came
on
before
the
judges
of
the
second
circuit,
they
were
six
in
number,
judge
swan
having
since
retired
and
the
decision
of
the
six
judges
was
right
down
the
middle,
they
split
evenly.
judge
lumbard,
judge
moore,
judge
friendly
voted
to
sustain
the
original
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals,
namely,
that
we
could
go
forward
with
our
action.
judges
clark,
waterman
and
smith
voted
to
reverse
that
determination
and
sustained
the
decision
of
the
district
court
on
the
authority
of
the
steelworkers
cases
and
to
--
and
the
other
case
was
left.
mr.
robert
abelow
the
court
--
mr.
robert
abelow
well,
that
seemed
to
be
a
question
because
the
six
active
judges
then
took
a
vote
on
that.
what
did
the
evenly
divided
court
mean?
and
there
was
a
vote
of
four-to-two
on
that,
with
judges
lumbard
and
friendly
still
maintaining
that
the
original
court
of
appeals'
decision
stood
but
the
four
other
judges
outvoting
them
and
so
that's
the
way
that
was
decided.
mr.
robert
abelow
that
is
correct.
and
so,
we
are
here
facing
a
stay
of
the
action
and
thus
the
case
reaches
the
--
this
court.
now
simply
stated,
the
issue
that's
presented
for
determination
here
is
whether
a
breach
of
the
no-strike
clause
in
the
drake
contract
is
this
--
is
within
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause
in
the
drake
contract.
and
there
is
a
second
issue
and
that
is
whether
the
union
having
breached
the
grievance
and
arbitration
clauses
by
advising
its
employees
--
its
members
not
to
work
and
causing
what
we
say
was
a
stoppage
and
a
strike
whether
the
union
may
now
use
these
very
clauses
as
a
shield
to
block
judicial
redress
for
the
very
violation
--
mr.
robert
abelow
--
it
assumed.
mr.
robert
abelow
well,
haven't
taken
any
position
with
regard
to
rescission
of
the
contract.
the
--
mr.
robert
abelow
we
do
take
that
position.
mr.
robert
abelow
under
301
(a),
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
abelow
by
virtue
of
section
301
(a).
mr.
robert
abelow
and
the
provisions
of
the
contract,
which
i
will
refer
to
in
further
detail
a
little
later
in
my
argument.
mr.
robert
abelow
i
think
that
would
be
so
too.
but
actually
--
mr.
robert
abelow
actually,
we
haven't
reached
that
because
i
--
as
--
as
we
say,
the
arbitration
clause
by
the
very
wording,
excuses
the
arbitration
of
a
breach
of
this
kind
--
mr.
robert
abelow
--
of
courts.
mr.
robert
abelow
breach
of
the
no-strike.
mr.
robert
abelow
sir?
mr.
robert
abelow
it
is
not
arbitrable.
mr.
robert
abelow
but
aside
from
the
--
the
point
that
just
have
been
made,
the
courts
themselves
had
taken
the
position.
and
they
--
they
are
--
the
decisions
are
in
my
brief
that
the
nature
of
the
violation
is
such,
that
even
under
the
broadest
of
arbitration
clauses,
it
is
not
contemplated
under
the
history
of
section
301
(a)
that
breaches
of
a
no-strike
clause
claims
for
damages
must
be
submitted
solely
to
arbitration.
mr.
robert
abelow
i
agree
with
you.
had
they
--
they
--
the
parties
can
agree
to
arbitrate
anything
including
damages
for
a
strike.
but
in
our
particular
case,
we
say
there
is
no
such
language
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
will
try
to
point
out
a
little
later,
when
i
read
the
clauses,
i
think
we
have
language
to
the
opposite
effect.
mr.
robert
abelow
both.
breach,
we
say,
was
of
the
grievance
and
arbitration
clause
and
it
was
also
of
the
no-strike.
mr.
robert
abelow
we
would
have
a
right
to
sue
under
301
(a)
and
i
would
find
support
for
that
in
the
decisions
of
some
of
the
other
circuits.
now,
thus
far,
the
issues
which
we
have
discussed
have
been
passed
upon
by
the
first,
the
fourth,
the
fifth,
the
sixth
and
the
seventh
circuits.
and
each
one
of
them
had
held
that
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
clause
was
not
within
the
scope
of
an
arbitration
clause
even
where
the
arbitration
clause
was
phrased
in
broad
terms.
the
second
circuit
judges
who
consider
the
question
in
this
case
split
evenly.
and
about
two
months
ago,
the
third
circuit
in
the
yale
&
towne
case
also
split.
the
majority
holding
that
the
claim
for
damages
there
had
to
be
arbitrate
and
--
arbitrated
and
a
suit
could
not
be
maintained.
now,
getting
down
to
the
drake
clauses,
they
appear
on
pages
6,
7
and
8
of
the
record.
the
first
paragraph
under
the
grievance
procedure
is
admittedly
broad
and
provides
that
the
parties
will
adjust
complaints,
disputes
and
grievances
arising
between
them
involving
questions
or
interpretation
or
application
of
any
clause
automatic
covered
by
this
contract
directly
or
indirect
a
very
broad
clause
admitted.
yet,
in
the
following
paragraph,
you
have
this
sentence,
still
under
(a),
"it
is
agreed
that
in
the
handling
of
a
grie
--
of
grievances,
there
shall
be
no
interference
with
a
conduct
of
the
business."
and
we
say
that
is
an
exception
to
the
broadness
of
the
proceeding
language.
under
subsection
(b),
the
last
sentence
provides
that
if
there
is
no
satisfactory
adjustment
reached,
either
party
shall
have
a
right
to
refer
the
matter
to
arbitration.
it
doesn't
say
that
they
must,
it
doesn't
say
that
arbitration
is
the
sole
and
exclusive
remedy
and
it
doesn't
say
that
we
can't
sue
under
301
(a)
or
any
other
section.
the
no-strike
clause
which
appears
at
the
top
of
page
8
is
equally
broad
and
that
too
contains
a
limitation.
the
clause
says
that
there
shall
be
no
strikes,
boycotts,
interruptions
of
work,
stoppages,
temporary
walk
--
walkouts
or
lockouts
for
any
reason
except
one.
except
that
if
either
party
shall
fail
to
abide
by
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
pursuant
to
the
remaining
provisions
of
the
contract.
and
again,
we
say
that
this
very
language
precludes
in
itself
the
right
to
resort
to
economic
force,
economic
action
and
to
strike
and
whether
it
be
called
a
strike
or
a
stoppage
or
a
temporary
walkout,
they're
all
precluded
by
the
clause.
so
that
reading
the
drake
contract
clauses
and
without
reference
to
any
other
broad
principles
of
law,
we
say
that
drake
never
agreed
to
submit
if
any
claim
for
damages
or
a
breach
of
a
no-strike
clause
to
arbitration.
that
the
clauses
read
together
plainly
state
that
there
is
to
be
no
interference
with
business
while
grievances
are
being
handled,
plainly
state
that
strikes
include
stoppages
of
any
kind
and
plainly
say
that
the
union
may
strike
on
one
condition
during
the
life
of
the
contract
and
one
condition
only
and
that
is
if
the
employer
fails
to
live
up
to
an
arbitrators'
award.
and
on
the
argument
that
we
have
not
agreed
to
arbitrate,
this
issue,
aside
from
all
other
considerations,
we
believe
that
the
suit
was
properly
brought
and
may
not
be
stayed
in
an
arbitration.
i'm
getting
briefly
to
section
301.
the
basic
analysis
of
section
301
is
of
course
this
court's
opinion
in
the
lincoln
mills
case.
and
this
court
like
the
senators
who
drafted
the
clause,
which
ultimately
became
section
301,
regarded
the
no-strike
clause
as
the
very
core
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i
know
the
language
is
familiar
to
the
court
but
there
is
one
short
paragraph
that
seems
to
sum
up
what
i
want
to
say
about
the
no-strike
clause.
and
it's
the
familiar
paragraph
which
reads,
"plainly,
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
grievances,
grievance
disputes
is
the
quid
pro
quo
for
an
agreement
not
to
strike.
viewed
in
this
light,
the
legislation
does
more
than
confer
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
over
labor
organization.
it
expresses
a
federal
policy
that
federal
court
should
enforce
these
agreements
on
behalf
of
or
against
labor
organizations
and
then
industrial
peace
can
best
be
obtained
only
in
that
way."
now,
those
principles
were
again
repeated
and
reiterated
in
the
steelworkers
cases
and
particularly
--
particularly
in
the
warrior
&
gulf
navigation
case
where
the
court
stressed
that
the
crucial
importance
of
the
arbitration
and
grievance
machinery
came
about
because
it
was
a
corollary
to
the
union's
relinquishing
its
right
to
strike.
and
thus,
on
the
assumption
of
the
equally
and
crucially
importance
of
the
no-strike
clause,
the
decision
in
lincoln
mills
made
federal
law
applicable
to
301
cases
and
on
behalf
of
the
union
specifically
permitted
enforcement
of
the
arbitration
clauses
contained
in
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
the
drake
case,
this
case,
as
we
see
it,
presents
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
we
say
that
if
the
union
side
of
the
quid
pro
--
quid
pro
quo
under
301
(a)
requires
judicial
redress
then
the
employer's
side
of
the
quid
pro
quo,
namely,
the
no-strike
portion
of
the
quid
pro
quo
--
pro
quo
certainly
requires
judicial
redress
also.
answering
the
question
that
i
think
i've
been
asked
through
the
bench,
this
court
recently
in
the
lucas
flour
case
had
said
that
a
strike
during
the
term
of
a
contract
violates
the
grievance
and
arbitration
clauses
in
the
contract
even
when
there
isn't
a
no-strike
clause
included
in
the
contract.
and
this
basically
is
so
because
the
grievance
procedure
envisions
a
method
of
resolving
grievances
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
use
of
economic
force
and
is
incorporated
in
the
labor
agreement
to
prevent
a
force
of
that
kind.
mr.
robert
abelow
that's
right.
unfortunately,
the
lower
courts
didn't
agree
with
me
and
with
what
you
have
just
said.
i
believe,
too,
that
it
does
not
provide
for
compulsory
arbitration
of
a
no-strike
clause.
but
i
do
recognize
what
you
say
the
distinction
is
between
the
lucas
case
and
our
own.
mr.
robert
abelow
in
lucas
--
mr.
robert
abelow
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
abelow
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
abelow
don't
forget
that
in
drake
we
have
both
a
no-strike
clause
and
an
arbitration
clause.
in
lucas,
you
only
had,
if
i
recall,
the
grievance
machinery
and
the
arbitration
machinery.
mr.
robert
abelow
but
it
was
according
to
the
majority
opinion,
compulsory
and
binding.
mr.
robert
abelow
that's
right.
now,
there
seems
to
be
another
reason
why
it
--
it
just
isn't
sensible
or
practical
to
think
in
terms
of
the
grievance
machinery
and
the
arbitration
machinery
in
--
as
a
method
of
handling
claims
of
the
nature
asserted
by
drake
in
this
case.
grievance
machinery,
arbitration
machinery
are
inserted
in
contracts
to
take
care
of
the
ordinary
day-to-day
problems
that
arrive
in
any
--
rise
in
any
collective
bargaining
relationship.
and
ordinarily
there,
the
arbitration
and
grievance
processes
help
to
keep
the
industrial
peace.
but
in
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
situation,
the
peace
has
already
been
broken.
the
grievance
machinery
has
been
bypassed.
we've
had
a
strike.
and
it
seems
a
futile
thing
for
an
employer
now
to
be
required
to
sit
down,
to
do
the
various
steps
of
the
grievance
machinery
or
sit
down
with
the
union
representatives
and
discuss
with
him
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
should
be
damages.
and
any
arguments
to
the
contrary
would
rest
upon
the
assumption
that
the
draft
isn't
section
301,
one
of
the
most
important
sections
of
taft-hartley.
after
laboring
on
this
question
for
so
many
hundreds
of
hours,
we're
totally
unaware
of
the
fact
that
practically,
every
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
the
country,
i
think
that
the
percentage
is
in
the
very
high
90,
contains
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures.
and
if
the
union
is
correct,
that
section
301
actions
for
a
breach
of
a
no-strike
clause
must
be
stayed
pending
arbitration
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
section
301,
itself,
is
absolutely
meaningless
to
affect
its
primary
purpose
that
the
terms
of
industrial
strike
by
providing
a
federal
judiciary
remedy
for
a
breach
of
the
two
unique
and
crucial
provisions
of
any
collective
bargaining
agreement,
namely,
the
promise
of
the
union
not
to
strike
and
the
promise
of
the
employer
to
arbitrate.
looking
at
section
301,
we
find
certain
agency
rules
set
forth
under
subdivision
(d)
and
subdivision
(e).
and
these
rules
that
would
seem
would
be
mainly
applicable
to
no-strike
clause
situation.
and
if
the
congress
had
intended
violations
of
the
no-strike
clauses
to
be
subject
to
the
arbitration
procedure,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
not
have
provided
an
agency
rules
for
this
type
of
actions
or
certainly
they
would
have
no
pertinency
before
an
arbitrator.
mr.
robert
abelow
i
have
it
--
i
have
it
in
my
brief
exactly
and
according
--
according
to
a
report
of
the
bureau
of
national
affairs
that
appears
on
page
16
of
my
brief
which
they
say
that
99%
of
the
contracts
studied
by
the
bureau
of
national
affairs
contains
some
grievance
procedure.
indeed,
100%
of
the
contracts
in
manufacturing
establishments
contained
grievance
procedure.
further,
94%
of
all
contracts
provide
for
arbitration.
and
this
quote,
which
is
a
footnote
on
page
16
of
my
brief,
was
taken
from
the
volumes
to
which
we
subscribed
called
"collective
bargaining
negotiations
of
contracts"
issued
by
the
bureau
of
national
affairs.
does
that
answer
your
--
mr.
robert
abelow
--
question,
mr.
chief
justice?
now,
there
is
another
reason
why
a
suit
of
this
type
should
be
permitted
and
the
union
should
not
be
allowed
to
have
it
stayed
and
have
us
resort
to
arbitration.
and
it's
a
--
and
it's
a
reason
that
has
been
used
and
applied
by
almost
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
the
question
with
the
exceptions
that
i
have
mentioned.
that
is
that
it
seems
inconsistent
to
allow
a
union
to
shield
itself
behind
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions
which
it
has
flagrantly
violated.
some
of
the
decisions
which
have
permitted
lawsuits
have
rested
upon
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clauses.
other
decisions
which
i
have
quoted
in
our
brief
rested
upon
this
theory
that
the
union
having
done
something
wrong,
they
cannot
now
use
the
grievance
and
arbitration
machinery
as
a
shield.
and
still
other
courts
have
reached
the
same
decision
without
adapting
either
of
the
two
rationales.
but
in
any
event,
the
result
is
the
same.
and
we
submit
that
they
practically
--
at
that
--
this
practical
unanimity
in
the
basic
considerations
of
the
industrial
peace
should
make
it
the
rule
of
law
that
a
union
will
strike
during
the
life
of
a
contract
at
its
peril
and
that
it
may
not
take
the
easy
path
out
and
have
a
--
an
arbitrator
whose
tenure
of
office
depends
upon
the
goodwill
of
the
parties'
assessed
damage.
but
rather
that
they
should
--
shall
be
accountable
to
a
higher
authority
to
a
court
which
has
not
beholden
for
its
tenure
of
office
upon
the
will
of
the
parties
and
this
will
be
the
real
deter.
this
will
be
the
true
deterrence
to
the
strikes
that
have
occurred.
now,
judge
swan
in
the
original
panel
decision
--
mr.
robert
abelow
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
abelow
i
--
i
would
so
construe
it.
i
think
that
an
arbitrator
under
the
broad
powers
that
he
has
could
award
damages.
in
fact,
there
are
a
handful
of
cases
where
damages
have
been
awarded
by
arbitrators
under
their
board
powers.
mr.
robert
abelow
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
abelow
they
are
cited
in
--
in
mr.
meyer's
briefs.
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
that.
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
if
i
decided
to
waive
my
right
to
go
to
court
under
301
(a)
and
i
was
willing
to
go
to
arbitration,
i
don't
think
that
i
would
have
any
question
about
the
power
of
the
arbitrator
to
award
damages.
but
peculiarly,
very
peculiarly,
in
this
very
case,
in
this
very
situation
with
local
50,
two
years
ago,
when
they
pulled
an
overtime
strike
suddenly
decide
that
nobody
works
overtime.
and
we
call
it
a
strike
and
i
sued
for
damages.
i
went
before
an
arbitrator.
the
union
came
in
and
said
the
arbitrator
had
no
power
to
hear
this
case.
and
the
arb
--
and
the
--
and
they
frightened
that
poor
arbitrator
so
that
they
couldn't
get
her,
it
was
a
member
of
the
state
mediation
board
to
go
forward
with
that
case.
i
couldn't
get
the
case
started.
the
case
was
put
over
because
the
union
threatened
to
walk
out
of
the
hearing
if
the
--
if
the
arbitrator
started
the
case
and
said
that,
"if
i
wanted
to
make
them
arbitrate,
i
would
have
to
get
a
court
order
or
serve
a
10-day
notice
under
the
new
york
statute."
so
while
--
mr.
robert
abelow
--
i
agree
that
they
have
the
right
--
mr.
robert
abelow
no,
no,
but
i
--
while
i
agree
that
the
union
was
wrong
there,
our
own
experience
in
--
with
this
union
under
this
contract
has
--
has
soured
us,
if
i
may
use
that
expression
on
--
mr.
robert
abelow
it
is
--
it
is
an
irrelevancy
but
i
thought
i
--
i
was
trying
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
robert
abelow
yes,
they
had.
and
under
the
question
of
the
right
of
the
--
of
the
arbitrator
to
award
damages
--
mr.
robert
abelow
yes,
they
have
and
as
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
that
they
do
have
the
right
to
award
damages
but
our
point
being
that
we
don't
have
to
go
to
arbitration
because
we
have
not
agreed
to
go
to
arbitration.
and
we
would
prefer
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
federal
remedy
under
301
(a).
i
want
to
read
one
short
paragraph
from
judge
swan's
original
panel
decision,
which
sums
up
the
point
i
just
made
permitting
the
union
to
invoke
the
arbitration
procedure
after
they
have
reached
the
no-strike
clause.
judge
swan
said,
"even
the
absence
of
the
specific
no-strike
clause,
it
has
been
held
that
resorting
to
a
strike,
instead
of
utilizing
the
contractual
arbitration
machinery,
prevents
the
union
from
claiming
that
the
strike
must
be
arbitrated.
where
the
no-strike
clause
is
as
specific
as
in
the
case
at
bar,
it
seems
clear
that
the
parties
intended
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure
does
plan
strikes
as
a
means
of
resolving
industrial
disputes
but
did
not
intend
to
subject
alleged
breaches
of
the
no-strike
clause
to
arbitration
when
a
strike
was
resorted
to
before
making
any
attempt
to
utilize
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure."
now,
a
few
moments
ago,
i
noticed
that
the
solicitor
general
was
in
the
court.
i
don't
see
him
now
but
i
--
he
wrote
on
this
subject.
and
in
analyzing
and
--
and
his
article
appeared
in
the
harvard
law
review
which
was
written
after
the
lincoln
mills
case
and
his
observations
is
set
forth
on
page
26
of
my
brief.
and
there,
he
analyzed
the
lincoln
mills
case
and
set
forth
what
he
said
where
the
three
fundamental
rules
with
--
which
have
had
established.
but
his
concluding
paragraph
is
mostly
interesting.
these
rulings
establish
the
machinery
necessary
for
the
effective
judicial
enforcement
of
agreements
to
arbitrate
an
arbitration
awards
except
when
a
union
resorts
to
a
strike
upon
an
arbitrable
grievance.
consequently,
when
solicitor
general
cox
writing
as
he
did
put
in
those
words
in
his
analysis
of
the
lincoln
mills
decision,
it
would
seems
to
me
that
he,
too,
recognize
the
fundamental
inconsistency
of
arbitrating
a
claim
for
damages
arising
out
of
a
strike.
now,
i
have
not
discussed
the
merits
of
the
underlying
dispute
and
do
not
intend
to
do
so.
there
seems
little
doubt
that
the
dispute
was
one
that
could
have
been
arbitrated.
we
scheduled
this
production
12
or
14
days
before
the
schedule
went
into
effect.
we
had
numerous
conferences
with
the
committee
of
the
employees
and
the
union
representatives.
we
worked
out
a
modus
operandi
for
handling
the
situation
at
christmas.
it's
a
very
disappointing
one.
but
when
it
came
to
repeating
that
operation
for
the
new
year's
holiday,
we
were
told
nothing
doing
--
there'll
be
no
work
on
saturday.
and
when
we've
assisted
in
our
schedule
and
they
had
85%
to
95%
of
--
85%
to
90%
of
our
people
not
to
come
in,
we
call
that
a
strike
and
started
this
action.
we
submit
for
the
reasons
that
i
outlined
and
with
the
further
reasons
that
are
in
my
brief
that
the
decision
in
this
case
should
permit
the
prosecution
of
this
case
under
301
(a).
i
might
say
parenthetically
that
the
courts,
as
you
have
noticed,
seemed
to
be
split
on
it.
it's
a
matter
of
considerable
concern
in
the
labor
rela
--
labor
management
relations
community.
and
above
all,
we
believe
that
if
this
court
were
to
plainly
stay
--
mr.
robert
abelow
we
would
be
procuring
industrial
(voice

--
thank
you,
sir.
