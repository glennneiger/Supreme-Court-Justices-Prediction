mr.
howard
n.
meyer
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
one
point
that
i
want
to
come
to
at
once,
it
wasn't
part
as
of
my
plan
to
oral
argument
but
it
arose
from
a
question
which
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
of
mr.
abelow
concerning
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
compulsory
terminal
arbitration
provided
for
in
this
contract.
mr.
abelow
made
the
argument
that
it
was
not
in
the
district
court.
he
abandoned
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
does
not
press
it
in
his
written
brief
here
and
of
course,
i
haven't
responded
to
it
in
my
brief
and
it
is
now
raised
for
the
first
time
in
oral
argument.
i'm
quite
prepared
to
deal
with
it
and
i
will
say
most
emphatically
that
this
is
an
agreement
providing
for
compurs
--
compulsory
terminal
arbitration
as
the
court
can
see
while
looking
at
pages
6
and
7
of
the
record.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
it
was
not,
sir.
and
i
would
like
to
go
into
the
facts.
i
want
to
say
something
else,
too.
mr.
abelow
stated,
during
his
oral
argument,
that
there
was
a
threat
that
there
would
be
a
strike.
i
would
like
to
say
now
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that
statement,
that
in
the
pleadings
and
in
the
affidavits,
we
have
denied
that
there
was
a
strike
and
to
the
extent
that
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
make
clear
to
the
court
that
these
matters
are
not
all
black
and
white.
that
there
are
many
shadings
and
gradations
where
there
is
multiple
absenteeism
as
this
case
involves,
that
there
definitely
is
a
very
tenable
question,
a
very
meritorious
question
which
a
trio
tribunal
must
pass
on
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
strike.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
well,
the
arbitrator
if
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
--
if
i'm
correct.
that's
right.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
that's
right
but
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
another
broad
statement
which
mr.
abelow
made
about
the
circuit
court
cases
involving
cognate
or
related
questions
is
that
many
cases
have
held
that
where
there
is
a
strike
in
violation
of
the
arbitration
clause,
the
company
may
sue,
with
the
implications
that
irrespective
of
the
threat
of
the
arbitration
clause,
it
has
been
so
held.
now,
i've
carefully
going
through
all
those
cases.
and
there
isn't
one
that
so
holds
--
there
is
one,
cameron,
lodge
12
against
cameron
iron
--
iron
works
which
says
so
in
dictum.
but
in
that
case,
it's
only
a
dictum.
in
every
other
case
outside
of
the
second
circuit,
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
minute,
the
question
has
always
been,
was
there
a
waiver?
did
the
union
--
and
i
think
in
several
of
the
cases,
the
union
admitted
there
was
a
strike?
and
in
the
more
recent
cases
including
the
sinclair,
which
has
been
argued
today,
the
question
that
was
decided
there
was
only
one
and
that
is
the
construction
of
the
wording
there
which
was
different
from
the
wording
in
the
drake
case.
now
i
don't
want
to
address
myself
to
the
wording
in
the
sinclair
case,
that's
the
counsel
in
that
case
to
consider.
but
i
do
say
that
under
the
wording
of
our
arbitration
clause,
we
do
have
an
agreement
providing
that
the
issue
involved
shall
be
submitted
in
writing,
the
matter
shall
then
be
taken
up
for
adjustment
between
the
union
and
the
plant
manager.
the
--
either
party
shall
have
the
right
to
refer
the
matter
to
arbitration.
should
any
party
fail
upon
written
notice
to
appear
before
the
arbitrator,
the
arbitrator
may
proceed
with
the
hearing.
now,
i
say
take
them
together,
those
clauses
constitute
and
have
always
been
construed
between
us
as
a
practical
matter
to
constitute
an
agreement
for
compulsory
terminal
arbitration
between
this
union
and
this
company.
now,
as
to
the
merits,
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
argue
before
the
court
who
was
right
and
who
was
wrong
in
what
happened
in
1959.
but
i
do
think
that
enough
of
the
background
should
be
stated
so
that
the
court
can
see
that
an
arbitrator
would
be
well
within
his
powers
if
he
held
that,
as
he
might,
there
was
no
strike
or,
as
he
might,
that
the
absenteeism
that
occurred
on
january
2nd,
1960
was
provoked
by
the
mishandling
by
the
company
of
its
labor
relations
or
if
he
held
that
by
reason
of
the
past
practice,
the
employees,
involved
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons,
believed
in
good
faith,
they
had
a
right
to
stay
home.
now,
the
word
"strike"
of
course
is
an
ugly
word.
and
one
thing
that
we
should
come
to
at
once
is
that
there's
a
tremendous
difference
and
it
isn't
necessarily
recognized
very
clearly
in
the
report
of
decisions
between
a
strike
--
when
the
strike
is
the
culmination
of
negotiations
for
a
new
contract
and
an
attempt
to
impose
new
economic
terms
on
one
party
and
the
other
and
what
has
sometimes
been
characterized
as
a
strike
but
which
is
better
characterized
as
a
wildcat
or
a
stoppage
or
something
to
that
effect
which
occurs
during
the
term
of
a
stoppage.
now,
characteristically,
and
it's
important
to
remember
this,
a
wildcat
is
a
response.
it's
a
response
to
a
provocation
of
one
sort
or
another.
to
say
that
it
is
a
response
to
provocation,
is
not
necessarily
to
say
that
it
is
correct
or
justified.
but
when
the
parties
have
agreed,
as
i
say
that
they
did
here,
that
all
complaints,
disputes
or
grievances
arising
between
them
involving
any
matter
covered
by
this
contract
or
any
act
or
conduct
or
relation
between
the
parties
hereto
directly
or
indirectly,
when
the
parties
have
agreed
that
that
is
the
area
that
is
to
be
decided
upon
by
an
arbitrator,
what
is
the
basis
for
a
judicial
ruling
that
the
dispute,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
strike,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
threat
to
strike,
which
i
say
you
will
find
nowhere
in
this
record
that
there
was
a
threat
to
strike,
that
whether
or
not
conduct
of
the
type
involved
here
can
be
characterized
as
a
strike?
let
me
describe
the
conduct
for
a
minute.
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
for
better
or
for
worst
for
15
years
we've
been
in
collective
bargaining
relationship.
we
want
them
to
prosper
the
number
of
dues
paying
members
that
we
have
depends
on
their
prosperity.
for
15
years,
they
have
worked
on
a
monday
to
friday
a
week
with
the
past
practice
as
we
claimed
that
when
a
--
holiday
comes
on
a
friday,
the
employees
are
given
a
three-day
weekend.
on
december
16th,
two
--
less
than
two
weeks
before
christmas,
they
notified
their
employees
that
they
would
be
deprived
of
their
three-day
weekend.
it
may
not
seem
very
much
in
the
multitude
in
this
great
affairs
of
the
world
but
to
the
people
averaging
between
$100
and
$120
a
week
working
for
drakes
at
the
time
it
came,
it
was
something
which
stirred
displeasure
and
unrest
among
them.
the
union
was
aware
of
it.
now,
let
me
say
another
thing
about
wildcat
strike.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
but
christmas
came
on
friday
that
year.
saturday
was
the
day
after
christmas
and
then
it's
sunday.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
and
mr.
abelow
has
carefully
omitted
from
his
oral
argument
the
fact
that
there
were
two
controversies
which
arose
simultaneously
and
through
the
efforts
of
the
union
who
was
in
constant
negotiation
from
the
day
that
we
got
the
notice
of
the
schedule
change.
we
were
able
to
persuade
enough
people
to
come
in
on
the
day
after
christmas
even
though
we
took
the
position
in
good
faith
that
we
didn't
think
they
were
obliged
to
so
for
them
to
conduct
production.
80
people
came
in
out
of
a
176.
they
don't
claim
that's
a
strike.
on
the
day
after
new
year's
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
i
don't
recall
whether
there's
anything
in
the
record
on
it.
my
belief
is
that
they
shut
down
on
thursday.
my
belief
is
that
they
shut
down.
and
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
well,
the
question
wasn't
the
five
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
that's
right.
the
question
was
three
consecutive
days
together.
now,
another
thing
which
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
we
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
we
are
not
claiming
that
the
company
was
depriving
them
of
anything
except
one
thing
and
that
is
three
consecutive
days.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
and
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
--
this
then
was
a
grievance.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
that's
right.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
we
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
we
sent
them
a
notice
demanding
arbitration.
we
couldn't
have
gotten
the
arbitration
in
the
mediation
board
calendar
before
january
26.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
our
operation
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
well,
that's
right.
meanwhile,
you
--
you
have
to
remember
these
two
things.
these
things
don't
happen
on
a
compartmentalize
way
like
pleadings
in
an
action.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
a
grievance
comes
up
but
while
the
grievance
is
pending,
while
we
dispute
their
right
to
do
this,
we're
sitting
down
talking
to
them,
as
this
record
will
eloquently
state
even
in
the
affidavit
in
opposition
to
our
motion
for
a
stay,
trying
to
work
out
some
compromised
arrangement.
now,
let
me
say
this.
all
of
these
would
have
been
unnecessary.
this
action
never
would
have
been
begun.
if
the
company,
which
for
15
years
hadn't
deprived
their
employees
of
a
three-day
weekend,
had
simply
decided
a
couple
of
weeks
earlier
to
do
it
and
given
us
a
chance
to
get
a
declaratory
ruling
by
an
arbitrator.
and
it
was
the
fact
that
they
waited
until
the
last
moment
when
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
process
the
grievance
through
to
a
point
where
we
could
get
a
ruling
by
an
arbitrator
in
advance
of
the
day
in
question.
that
was
what
resulted
in
the
difficulties
that
we
are
confronted
with
here.
the
employees
who
are
human
beings,
who
each
have
their
own
individuality
and
integrity
and
make
decisions
for
themselves,
the
business
agents
who
are
not
task
masters
and
overseers
don't
stand
over
them
with
a
whip
saying,
"you
must
work
because
the
company
has
a
management
prerogative."
the
employees
decided
for
themselves.
they
were
going
to
take
the
risk
of
such
reprimand
or
disciplinary
action
as
the
company
might
see
fit
to
impose
on
them
and
they
simply
stayed
home
on
january
2nd
except
for
26
of
them
despite
our
efforts.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
we
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
right.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
right,
right,
right.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
that's
right
and
it
was
precisely
because
of
that
as
you
will
find
in
the
record,
that
we
filed
immediately
and
the
record
does
show,
we
filed
a
grievance
demanding
arbitration
of
the
rate
of
pay
for
working
on
that
saturday
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
--
because
it
was
unprinted
--
precedented
circumstances
in
which
to
work.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
not
at
all.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
what
were
we
to
do?
we're
confronted
here
with
what
you
might
call
a
case
of
brinkmanship.
one
of
us
is
right
and
the
other
is
wrong
as
to
whether
or
not
the
company
had
a
right
to
change
its
schedules.
we
take
the
position
as
it
was
on
december
16th
when
the
company
announces
its
change
of
schedule.
they
say,
as
they
always
do,
management
prerogative
and
everything
else.
we
say,
past
practice
and
the
sort
of
things
that
union
say
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
right.
that
--
that's
exactly
right.
but
it's
also
a
matter
for
adjustment
machinery.
while
we
are
grieving
about
it,
while
we
can't
arrive
at
an
agreement
about
it
before
december
26th
comes,
neither
can
we
get
a
ruling
by
an
arbitrator
before
december
26th
comes.
and
so,
in
order
to
minimize
or
mitigate
or
reduce
the
area
of
difficulty,
we
turn
to
the
employees
and
say,
"how
many
of
you
want
to
come
in
even
though
we
don't
think
you're
obliged
to
come
in?"
isn't
it
preferable
that
we
should
do
that
rather
than
simply
sit
back
and
say
we
have
a
grievance,
don't
come
in
or
on
the
other
hand,
are
we
obliged
to
say
to
them,
"you
must
go
in
and
we'll
arbitrate
later?"
and
if
it
turns
out
they
had
no
right
to
make
you
go
in,
make
you
get
a
dollar
or
two
more.
now,
i
say
this,
and
i
was
starting
to
say
this
before,
that
workers
are
human
beings,
that
there
are
emotional
problems
of
a
very
serious
and
objective
character
involved
in
this
type
of
change
of
schedule
and
that
the
workers
might
justifiably
feel
that
a
dollar
or
two
more
is
not
adequate
compensation
for
having
their
right
to
a
three-day
weekend
taken
away.
now,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits.
only
an
arbitrator
can
say
whether
or
not
they
had
the
right
to
change
that
schedule.
also,
only
an
arbitrator
can
say
whether
the
complex
of
circumstances
which
occurred
here,
including
our
appearing
at
the
plant
and
negotiating,
talking
to
the
people,
trying
to
prevail
upon
them
to
come
in,
whether
this
can
be
characterized
as
a
strike
or
a
stoppage
in
violation
of
the
agreement.
now,
we're
here
under
an
agreement,
which
we
say
and
we
insist,
provides
for
compulsory
terminal
arbitration,
which
has
always
been
administered
in
that
way.
and
we
say
that
the
concurring
opinion
of
judges
brennan
and
harlan
in
this
(inaudible)
american
case
dispose
of
it
very
adequately.
on
examining
the
arbitration
clause,
they
say
the
court
may
conclude
that
it
commits
to
arbitration
any
dispute,
difference,
disagreement
or
controversy
of
any
nature
or
character.
with
that
finding,
the
court
will
have
exhausted
its
function.
now,
i
say
we
have
a
broader
clause
than
that.
and
once
it
is
found
that
our
clause
is
broader
and
that
our
clause
provides
as
it
does
that
involved
in
the
arbitration
machinery
should
be
all
complaints,
disputes
or
grievances
and
so
on,
i'm
not
going
to
repeat
the
wording,
that
once
that
is
found,
that
the
court
as
chief
judge
ryan
correctly
held,
exhausted
its
function.
you
might
say
that
we
are
here
as
a
suitor.
while
we
are
here
on
a
motion
to
stay,
you
could
also
call
our
motion
for
procedural
purposes
of
counterclaim
under
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
we
are
seeking
to
enforce
judicially,
our
right
to
arbitration
under
this
contract.
and
we
say
that
that
must
--
it
needs
--
must
be
adjudicated
prior
to
any
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
strike,
who
was
responsible
for
the
strike,
what
the
damages
were.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
exactly.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
it.
i
don't
think
that
as
i
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
that's
right.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
and
let
me
--
let
me
say
this
one
--
one
more
point
which
i
should
mention
in
this
connection.
it
is
also
quite
clear
under
this
contract,
as
it
was
not
in
many
of
the
mid-west
cases
that
led
to
the
sinclair
case.
it
is
quite
clear
under
this
contract
that
the
employer
may
grieve,
that
the
employer
is
visualized
as
one
who
may
make
a
claim
in
arbitration.
and
i
have
presented
in
point
one
of
my
brief
an
analysis
of
the
clauses
providing
for
it,
the
employer
made
--
the
arbitrator
shall
be
designated
upon
the
written
request
of
either
the
employer
or
the
union
and
so
on.
now,
mr.
abelow
in
his
brief
has
made
much
of
the
claim
that
the
only
solid
gain
by
an
employer
in
a
contract
such
as
this
is
the
no-strike
clause.
i
happen
to
disagree
with
that
interpretation.
i
think
an
employer
gets
a
lot
more
from
an
agreement
than
merely
a
no-strike
clause.
but
even
on
his
theory
that
it's
the
only
thing
that
he's
really
concerned
about,
if
that's
so,
what
else
would
he
want
to
take
to
arbitration
but
that
since
that
is
what
he
claims
to
be
able
to
grieve
about
and
he
has
reserved
the
right
to
go
to
arbitration?
now,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
now
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
i
don't
mean
to
be
facetious.
but
what
you
are
saying
is
suppose
they
had
by
an
instrument
in
writing,
duly
acknowledged,
said,
"we
hereby
declare
we
are
going
on
strike
because
you
did
this."
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
i
would
still
say
that
on
the
wording
of
the
drake
contract
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
refer
to
arbitration
because
that's
what
we
bargained
for.
when
we
drew
this
contract
and
drew
this
arbitration
clause,
this
is
what
we
agreed
upon,
that
when
there
was
to
be
any
complaint,
dispute
or
grievance
concerning
any
matter
or
controversy
between
the
parties
that
an
arbitrator
should
pass
upon
it.
now,
a
question
is
raised
about
so-called
"judicial
redress".
it
happens
that
arbitrable
redress
is
not
only
more
flexible,
not
only
more
suitable
both
for
the
needs
of
the
parties
and
their
situation
but
it
also
may
be
more
draconic
and
more
effective
for
the
purposes
of
the
employer,
as
the
new
york
courts
held
in
ruppert
against
egelhofer
which
is
cited
in
my
brief.
there
are
two
cases
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
cited
in
my
brief
which
are
very
interesting
and
which
i
think
are
very
susceptible
to
be
absorbed
into
federal
law
under
the
lincoln
mills
dictum.
number
one
is
the
matter
of
the
printing
pressmen
stereo
--
newark
stereotypers
which
held
that
there's
no
doubt
that
an
arbitrator
can
render
damages
for
a
violation
of
a
no-strike
clause.
the
other
is
ruppert
against
egelhofer
which
provides
the
clue
and
gives
the
way
for
solving
the
type
of
problem
that
was
presented
by
number
13,
which
is
still
pending
at
this
term,
and
one
phase
of
the
sinclair
case
that
we
are
not
confronted
with,
namely,
on
--
injunctive
relief
where
appropriate
or
necessary
where
in
the
hypothetical
case
presented
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
employees
wrongfully
and
say
in
writing,
"this
fellow
is
a
strike
and
we've
hit
the
bricks
and
we're
out."
i
say
that
an
arbitrator
under
ruppert
against
egelhofer
has
the
right
to
adjudicate
that.
the
employer
has
a
right
summarily
to
go
to
court
and
get
an
order
confirming
that
at
least
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
construed
new
york
state's
own
anti-injunction
law.
now,
i'm
not
here
to
argue
any
other
questions
under
norris-laguardia
or
anything
else.
but
i
do
say
this,
that
if
the
issue
in
this
case
is
said
to
depend
on
whether
arbitration
is
more
effective
or
more
adequate
as
a
means
for
dealing
with
stoppages
that
ruppert
against
egelhofer
and
manner
--
matter
of
printing
pressmen
show
very
clearly
that
it
can
be
more
effective.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
if
your
honor
please,
i'm
here
invoking
that
of
jurisdiction.
just
--
let's
get
that
clear.
i'm
here
invoking
that
jurisdiction
to
enforce
their
promise
to
arbitrate
all
disputes
or
agreements
or
disagreements
between
us.
now,
many
arbitration
clauses
are
not
as
broad
as
ours.
many
fact
situations
may
present
different
problems.
many
unions
may
as
the
union
in
lucas
flour
did,
choose
to
waive
arbitration.
i
looked
for
the
first
time
today
at
the
record
of
lucas
flou
--
flour,
when
i
went
upstairs
to
the
library,
and
i
saw
there
that
there
was
no
reason
why
the
union
there
couldn't
have
moved
in
the
massachusetts
state
court
or
remove
to
the
federal
court
for
the
purpose
of
staying
that
damage
action
so
it'd
be
arbitrated.
but
apparently,
they
chose
otherwise.
when
the
parties
choose
otherwise,
when
both
of
them
decide
we'd
had
enough
of
arbitration,
we
don't
want
it,
we
want
to
see
what
a
judge
says
about
this,
there's
no
reason
why,
as
far
as
i
see
it,
the
federal
court
shouldn't
take
jurisdiction.
perhaps,
if
mr.
justice
frankfurter
were
here,
he
might
feel
otherwise
that
the
court
--
the
court
has
been
ousted
of
jurisdiction
by
a
very
broad
arbitration
clause.
again,
i'm
not
here
to
argue
that
question.
but
i
do
say
this
that
whatever
was
the
situation
at
the
time
the
301
was
passed,
the
situation
now
is
that
there
are
many
and
varying
types
of
arbitration
clauses.
the
question
of
the
alleged
violation
of
a
no-strike
clause
may
come
up
in
many
and
very
fact
patterns
and
fact
situations.
and
i
say
the
district
courts
are
not
to
be
flooded
with
a
case
every
time
the
employer
files
an
affidavit
saying
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
no-strike
clause.
and
let
me
say
this,
here
--
here's
a
perfect
example
in
this
very
case
of
how
the
common
law
of
the
shop
could've
been
involved
in
a
completely
different
way.
on
page
10
of
the
contract,
there's
another
clause
which
is
import
--
is
as
important
to
the
employer,
it
seems
to
me
as
the
no-strike
clause,
its
clause
held
cooperation
on
absenteeism,
"the
union
agrees
to
cooperate
with
the
company
to
eliminate
excessive
absenteeism
particularly
during
a
holiday
week."
now,
conceivably,
the
issue
that
was
presented
in
this
case
where
only
one
day
was
taken
off,
where
there
were
no
tickets,
where
we
had
no
ulterior
demand,
mind
you
that's
an
important
part
of
this
case,
we
weren't
striking
to
gain
some
benefit,
some
other
change
of
contract
relations.
we
had
people
who
stayed
home
before
because
they
thought
they
had
a
right
to
stay
home
and
because
they
thought
it
was
an
imposition
to
make
them
come
in.
now,
why
wasn't
the
union's
obligation
completely
defined
and
to
be
measured
by
the
cooperation
on
absenteeism
clause?
why
shouldn't
we
be
able
to
come
in
and
try
to
persuade
an
arbitrator
that
what
occurred
during
christmas
week
of
1959
was
really
something
which
was
involved
in
clause
11
on
"cooperation
on
absenteeism,"
and
that
we
had
and
that
we
had
proved
on
christmas
day,
the
day
after
christmas,
saturday,
december
26th,
by
getting
80
people
in
done
or
not
--
oh
no,
to
cooperate
in
curbing
absenteeism.
and
that
what
happened
nevertheless
was
that
the
resentment
of
the
employees
boiled
over
that
a
few
hotheads
in
the
shop
decided
"no,
we
are
not
going
to
come
in
despite
the
business
agents."
and
that
was
if
26
of
them
came
in
and
the
rest
didn't.
are
we
to
be
held
to
litigate
in
a
federal
court
with
pleadings
and
propositions
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
that
is
so
stated
on
page
29
of
the
record
in
the
moving
affidavit.
the
union
secretary-treasurer
states,
"i
respectfully
pray
that
the
court
treat
this
affidavit
as
a
counterclaim
for
specific
performance
of
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
this
as
a
motion
for
summary
of
judgment
on
such
counterclaim
if
in
the
court's
opinion,
such
is
procedurally
appropriate."
and
that
of
course
was
because
of
this
situation
at
the
time
this
action
arose.
i
didn't
know
how
much
further
the
united
states
arbitration
act
would
be
defined
in
its
application
to
these
controversies.
i
didn't
know
to
what
extent
under
the
appropriate
federal
practice,
the
new
york
state
civil
practice
act
would
be
applied
to
these
situations
or
whether
301
would
be
regarded.
but
what's
the
difference?
what
coat
we
wear
or
what
suit
we
wear?
we
are
here
in
one
posture
as
a
--
an
entity
claiming
that
we
have
bargained
for
our
contract,
that
all
disputes
or
grievances
are
to
be
resolved
by
arbitration
and
we
have
been
deprived
so
far
by
the
conduct
of
our
adversary
of
what
judicial
redress
we
bargained
for.
now,
there's
another
thing
i'd
like
to
mention
in
connection
with
this
whole
context
and
that
is
the
fact
that
we
are
a
local
union.
we're
a
local
union
with
autonomy,
3500
members.
to
us,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
have
to
litigate
in
a
federal
court
with
pleadings,
motions,
depositions,
calendar
appearance,
pre-trials,
four
days
in
court
as
against
one
appearance
before
an
arbitrator
which
usually
disposes
of
these
things
is
something
very
vital
which
we
bargained
for.
i
won't
say
anything
about
the
union's
retainer
arrangement
with
me
because
it's
not
in
the
record.
but
the
court
can
understand
and
assume
that
it
is
more
costly.
now,
a
clue
to
what's
in
my
adversary's
mind
is
this.
what
he
wants
and
what
he
seeks
to
establish,
and
i
think
this
is
in
the
last
sentence
of
both
his
reply
brief
and
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
company's
brief
in
the
sinclair
case,
what
he
wants
is
the
sanction
of
the
threat
of
a
lawsuit.
he
doesn't
want
the
sanction
of
a
fair
adjudication
in
a
lawsuit
as
to
who
is
right
or
who
is
wrong
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
i
want
relief
before
we
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
--
the
merits
of
this.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
well
--
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
usually,
the
cases
are
presented
in
the
form
or
guise
of
a
motion
for
stay.
that
was
the
situation
in
signal-stat
against
local
435
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari.
the
interesting
and
ironic
thing
about
the
disposition
of
this
case
below
is
that
it
was
decided
by
a
panel
which
was
different
from
the
panel
in
signal-stat.
mr.
howard
n.
meyer
i
don't
think
either
of
us
have
considered
or
briefed
that
question.
i
think
all
courts
assume
that
if
the
scope
of
the
contract,
and
i
think
the
yale
&
towne
which
is
the
most
recent
and
i
think
the
best
written
case
on
the
subject,
all
courts
have
assumed
that
if
when
an
employer
has
come
to
court
with
his
grievance,
the
other
side
says,
"you
should've
gone
to
an
arbitrator
with
your
grievance."
that
is
enough
to
found
federal
jurisdiction
on
for
the
purposes
of
301.
i
might
mention
that
one
of
our
outstanding
grievances
which
will
be
litigated
after
this
case
is
over,
and
it's
set
forth
in
the
record,
is
whether
or
not
we
can
claim
damages
for
them
for
violating
the
contract
by
going
to
court
because
that
has
imposed
expenses
on
the
union,
which
it
didn't
have
otherwise,
and
as
i
say,
we
bargained
for
a
certain
method
and
scope
of
adjudicating
our
controversies.
that's
why
i
say
in
this
situation
and
--
the
drake
case
is
really
a
good
rock
on
which
this
whole
artificial
trend
should
found
it.
this
case,
we
think,
presents
a
very
clear
illustration
that
there
are
many,
many
different
fact
situations
and
there
are
many
varieties
of
provocation
in
a
strike
situation.
just
take
the
offense
of
last
week
in
the
steel
industry,
if
the
president
had
not
moved
so
fast
and
so
aggressively,
wouldn't
it
be
conceivable
that
at
many
mills,
people
would
stay
off
the
job
in
resentment
at
having
signed
a
contract
without
an
increase
on
the
implied
representation
that
there
wasn't
going
to
be
a
price
increase.
they
returned
to
the
bargaining
table
on
the
president's
request
for
a
non-inflationary
agreement.
after
that
happened,
the
day
after
the
last
contract
was
signed,
there
was
a
price
increase
or
a
price
increase
attempted.
now,
i
think
most
lawyers
know,
although
none
have
said
publicly,
that
silence,
when
there
is
a
duty
to
speak
or
when
one
who
is
silent,
implies
or
permits
to
be
implied
from
his
conduct
a
statement
which
is
contrary
to
what
his
silence
is
conveying
is
as
guilty
of
a
fraudulent
misrepresentation
as
one
who
makes
a
flat
misrepresentation
and
that
might
have
been
the
situation
there.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i
bet
the
court
has
my
point.
