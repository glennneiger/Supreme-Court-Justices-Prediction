if

effect
i
gather

nothing
stand
the

court's
judgment,
did
it?
justice

so
we
have
and
like,
we
do
have
a
majority
vote
that
what
comes
to
us
is
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
justice

although
i
gather

justice
william

--
your
position

at
least,
he
didn't
say
you
could
rescind
the

by
reason
of
their
failure
to
resort
for
the

justice
william
j.

well,
you
do
take
the
position
you're
entitled
to
damages
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
would
breach
the
no-strike
clause.

justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
does
the
(inaudible)
mean
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
is
breach
of
the
no-strike
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
but
then
it
is
not
itself
an
arbitrable
question,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
not
arbitrable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

under
the
arbitration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
isn't
to
say
that
the
parties
couldn't
say
expressly
in
so
many
words
as
they
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that,
specifically,
it
maybe
that
this
is
act
or
conduct.
justice
william
j.

parties
have
agreed?

justice
william

brennan,

may
i
ask
you,
mr.
meyer,
suppose
in
fact
the
--
these
employees
and
through
the
union
spokesman
had
said,
"alright,
we're
going
on
a
strike
tomorrow
morning
on
the
2nd."
no
one
had
shown
up.
would
you
still
be
taking
the
position
that
that
would
be
conduct
or
an
act
coming
within
the

arbitrable

justice
william

yes.
justice

may
i
--
i
understand
this,
mr.
meyer,
are
you
telling
us
that
we
should
treat

of
the

is

read
it?
each

to
section
301
of

arbitration

as
actually

a
counterclaim
for
some
specific
performance
of

justice
william
j.
brennan,

mr.
meyer,
ordinarily,
am
i
correct?
at
least
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court,
it's
the
one
with
a
grievance
who
would
gone
in
under
301
and
ask
specific
performance
of
an
arbitration
agreement
covering
that
grievance.
here,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
company
is
the
one
claiming
to
be
aggrieved
in
the
insistence
on
arbitration
under
your
suggestion
treating
this
as
a
counterclaim,
is
that
you
want
that

that
we

justice

are
there
other
cases
involving

justice
william

that
kind
of
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
anything
occur
to
you
that
was
--
there
should
be
a
distinction
under
301
whether
the
one
invoking
specific
performance
under
that
is
the
one
aggrieved
or
the
one
that
gets
to
whom
the
contention
is
being
