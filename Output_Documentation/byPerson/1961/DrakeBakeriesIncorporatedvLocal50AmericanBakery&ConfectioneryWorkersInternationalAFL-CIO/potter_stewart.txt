justice

stewart
and
the
provisions
of
the
contract.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
that
case
as
i
remember,
the
court
construed
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
provide
for
compulsory
terminal
arbitration.
now,
the
agreement
before
us
in
this
case
does
not
provide
for
compulsory
arbitration
as
the
exclusive
method
of
settling
agreements
as
you
pointed
out,
it's
optional.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
in
this
case,
a
good
argument
could
be
made
at
least
that
the
strike
was
or
at
least
have
better
or
different
argument
could
be
made
than
--
then
was
available
in
lucas
flour
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
say
that
a
strike
was
not
in
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
i
take
it
would
go
to
the
merits
of
your
lawsuit
in
the
district
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
not
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
was
compulsory
and
binding.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
and
as
so
construed.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
strike
was
clearly
in
violation
of
this
agreement,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
district
court
if
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
or
for
the
arbitrator
if
--
if
you're
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event
after
the
--
after
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
under
the
--
justice

the
person
who's
got
to
decide
the
terms
and
merits
of
this
controversy.
justice

stewart
how
about
the
day
before
thursday
which
the
company
wanted
to
give
them
off,
did
they
take
that
off
or
did
they
come
in?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
had
their
five-day
week.
the
only
thing
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they
didn't
have
that
three-day
weekend.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
company
gave
them
off
--
gave
them
a
day
off
in
the
thursday
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
christmas
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
then
was
a
grievance,
i
suppose,
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
--
did
the
union
or
the
company
make
every
--
any
effort
at
all
to
proceed
under
the
contract
without
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
grievance?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
arbitration
under
the
contract
that
comes
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
comes
only
at
the
end
of
--
of
a
grievance,
the
prosecuted
grievance.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
not
--
what
i'm
really
trying
to
get
out
was
that
the
union's
position
that
this
decision
of
the
company
that
the
employees
had
to
work
on
friday
was
a
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
was
not
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
decided
one
point
that
--
just
let
me
explain
to
you
my
doubt
and
my
uncertainty
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
i
understand
this,
one
point
or
more
than
once,
you
told
us
that
the
union
prevailed
upon
the
employees
to
work
on
the
friday
after
christmas,
at
least
80
out
of
174
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
and
at
the
same
time,
you
told
us
that
the
union
has
taken
the
position
that
they
had
no
duty
to
work
on
the
friday.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
would
be
of
course
a
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
the
pay
rate,
i
suppose,
would
be
--
if
you
were
negotiating
at
that
level,
this
--
this
implies
a
concession
that
there
--
that
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
agreement
that
they
were
concerned.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
typically
a
matter
for
the
grievance
machinery.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
these
are
--
that's
interesting
and
perhaps
persuasive
--
arguably
persuasive
as
a
matter
of
policy.
the
--
but
we're
faced
with
however,
is
an
act
of
congress.
congress
of
the
united
states
which
had
before
us
and
through
its
committee
proponents
of
various
policies
determined
finally
to
confer
upon
the
federal
district
courts
jurisdiction
over
violations
of
bargaining
--
of
contracts
made
by
labor
organizations
between
employers
and
labor
organizations
and
industries
affecting
commerce.
and
your
argument
would
lead
in
it's
ultimate
reach
to
the
--
to
the
obliteration
of
such
jurisdiction
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
except
to
the
enforcement
of
arbitrational
orders.
