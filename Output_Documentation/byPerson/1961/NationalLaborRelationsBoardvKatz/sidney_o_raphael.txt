mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
think
i
feel
privileged
to
argue
this
case
especially
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
i
have
an
umbilical
tie
so
to
speak
for
this
case
--
to
this
case
from
its
very
birth.
we
go
back
to
the
early
part
of
the
spring
of
1956
just
about
six
years
ago
when
this
case
had
its
inception
and
the
demands
by
the
union,
local
1966
for
recognition.
having
had
a
long
experience
in
the
field
of
labor
relations
and
this
employer
having
enjoyed
for
many,
many
years
a
history
of
bargaining
with
about
seven
or
eight
labor
unions
collective
agreement,
we
did
not
resist
the
petition
for
recognition
and
there
was
a
consent
election.
there
was
a
certification
on
the
early
part
of
july
by
the
director
of
the
second
region
and
of
course
as
your
honors
know
on
the
summer,
people
are
away
on
vacation
and
we
did
not
readily
meet,
it
took
a
few
weeks.
and
in
the
interim,
we
received
a
list
of
demands
from
the
union
that
sounded
almost
as
though
they
were
ready
to
take
over
the
business.
and
i
think
that
you
will
find
this
in
exhibit
10
which
is
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
this
is
not
unusual
judge
brennan.
this
happens
all
the
time.
but
this
--
in
this
case,
i
want
to
point
this
out
particularly
because
i
think
they
went
a
little
overboard.
they
asked
for
things
which
i
thought
meant
in
the
field
of
labor
relations,
they
wanted
a
home
run
the
first
time
they
were
up
at-bat.
and
we
have
a
lot
of
experts
dealing
in
this
case.
the
union's
representatives
had
a
long
field,
a
long
background,
the
employer
did,
i
did
and
we
were
all
conversant
with
the
fact
that
this
could
not
be
achieved
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
however,
it's
a
usual
thing
as
your
honors
know
to
ask
for
all
you
can
get
then
you
bargain
it
down
and
perhaps
you
settle
for
a
lot
less.
so
then,
this
exhibit
10
which
appears
at
pages
263
through
267
of
the
record,
and
i
want
to
point
out
one
thing
here
which
is
going
to
become
significant
in
the
later
portion
of
my
argument.
and
that
is
this
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
yes,
i
think
it's
in
volume
1.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
yes.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
26
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
thank
you
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
my
argument
shortly
before
we
--
your
honor
declared
a
recess.
somewhere
around
april
of
1957
after
we
had
gone
through
12
hectic
bargaining
sessions
over
a
period
of
time,
we
found
ourselves
in
the
position
of
where
we
were
vacillating
between
individual
collective
bargaining,
industry
wide
collective
bargaining.
and
frankly,
i
don't
think
anybody,
you,
neither
the
state
mediation
border
or
the
union
or
those
people
who
were
sitting
in
as
a
group
in
these
negotiations
in
what
thing
we
were
bargaining.
i
think
everybody
recognized
though
that
an
industry-wide
pattern
would
have
been
the
more
preferable
method
of
evolving
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
it
would've
established
uniform
conditions.
and
that
was
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
this
is
metal
fabricating
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
no,
it's
pennsylvania,
new
york
and
new
jersey
principally.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
and
our
members
have
rather
substantial
plants
in
all
of
these
three
states.
and
what
we
were
trying
to
achieve
is
a
uniformity
of
conditions.
and
i
think
the
union
went
along
with
that,
shall
we
say
sub-consciously,
although
not
voicing
it
in
those
words.
now,
the
reference
has
been
made
in
the
argument
of
the
petition.
it
might
have
been
availed
inference
that
there
was
a
sham
bargaining.
again,
i
want
to
repeat
that
the
risk
of
--
perhaps
being
redundant
that
we
have
real
genuine,
sincere
bargaining
and
rather
lengthy
and
hectic
sessions
that
resolved
many
issues
and
resulted
in
a
wage
pattern
which
meant
perhaps
over
a
million
dollars
as
far
as
our
members
will
consign
for
a
period
of
a
three-year
agreement.
now,
when
we
got
down
to
about
the
middle
of
may
and
the
situation
became
very
acute
because
a
strike
had
been
declared
against
one
of
the
members
of
the
association.
and
there
was
general
chaos
and
disruption
among
the
workers
which
we
contended
on
the
record
was
generated
and
inspired
by
the
union's
representatives.
when
that
situation
eventuate,
we
at
that
time
said
to
the
union,
“look,
if
we
cannot
agree
amicably
on
what
constitutes
the
format
of
a
collective
agreement,
let
us
give
this
thing
to
the
american
arbitration
association
for
them,
for
an
arbitrator
or
a
panel
of
arbitrators
to
be
chosen
who
have
the
expertise
in
dealing
with
these
problems
and
we
are
agreeable
to
be
bound
by
their
award.”
well,
surprisingly,
the
union
refused
to
go
along.
and
with
the
result
that
the
--
there
was
a
complete
impasse
at
that
time.
the
union
wrote
us
a
letter,
we
wrote
the
union
a
letter
and
for
a
period
of
two
months,
we
heard
nothing
from
the
union
at
all.
so
that
following
may
the
17th,
which
is
a
local
date,
somewhere
at
the
beginning
of
july
and
just
about
the
time
when
the
certification
year
was
to
expire,
the
employees
were
then
the
collective
bargaining
unit,
sua
sponte
disowned
the
union,
notified
us
that
they
were
no
longer
interested
in
having
the
union
bargain
for
them
collectively.
but
even
before
this
impasse
resulted
in
may
of
1957,
we
had
another
curious
situation
which
brought
about
an
impasse
and
that
was
this.
while
we
were
engaged
in
this
overall
industry-wide
bargaining
the
union
went
and
they
used
the
divide
and
conquer
procedure
which
they
have
a
perfect
right
to
do.
it's
--
all
is
fair
in
an
economic
war,
we
agree
to
that.
and
they
went
and
obtained
a
collective
agreement
from
the
largest
employer
in
the
industry
operating
a
plant
in
pottsville,
pennsylvania.
and
in
this
agreement,
a
clause
was
written
which
stated,
“no
other
employee
shall
be
accorded
times
and
conditions
more
favorable
than
those
that
are
prescribed
in
this
contract.”
and
that
was
sometime
of
the
early
part
of
january
of
1957
so
that
when
we
met
with
the
union's
representatives
the
next
time,
we
were
met
head
on
with
the
statement
by
the
union
that
we
would
have
to
conform
with
the
times
and
conditions
of
this
atmosphere
contract.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
well,
i
believe
that
and
if
we're
to
follow
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
well,
no.
i
would
like
to
--
i
would
like
to
agree
with
you
that
it
is
a
narrow
question.
i
realized
that
i
don't
--
nobody
would
like
to
overburden
the
court.
but
unfortunately,
in
the
light
of
the
decisions
especially
the
insurance
agents
case,
i
think
that
the
factual
content
of
the
case
with
respect
to
the
good
or
bad
faith
bargaining
becomes
very
crucial
if
we
ought
to
sustain
the
corollary
findings
under
8
(a)
(5)
and
8
(a)
(1).
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
well,
they
didn't
disagree
with
the
factual
findings
but
they
had
reservations
about
them.
but,
it
is
my
opinion
that
since
the
court
was
determined
by
majority
opinion
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
board
on
a
mandate,
to
educe
additional
evidence
with
respect
to
the
good
or
the
bad
faith
finding,
i
think
that
in
effect
eventually
would
resolve
the
issue.
because
if
we
went
back
to
the
board
and
we
have
to
determine
the
good
faith
of
the
employer,
additional
evidence
would
have
to
be
educed.
and
this
additional
evidence
would
in
turn
supplement
the
evidence
already
adduced
and
then
the
board
would
have
to
say,
“well,
we
feel
that
the
overall
bargaining
tactics
of
this
employer
were
fair,
that
perhaps
he
did
go
often
the
left
field
a
little
bit
here
and
there
but
it
wasn't
that
serious
and
it
didn't
amount
to
that
much
that
we
have
to
make
an
overall
finding
of
failure
to
bargain.”
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
if
the
court
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
if
the
fact
--
if
you
agree
with
the
threshold
question,
that's
it.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
no,
i
feel
that
you
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
well,
i
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
issue
on
the
cases
whether
or
not
the
case
on
the
totality,
we
go
back
to
the
universal
camera
case.
in
other
words,
on
the
basis
of
the
overall
evidence
on
the
case,
we
contend
that
there
has
not
been
substantial
evidence
to
make
an
overall
finding
in
this
case.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
a
finding
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
a
finding
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
a
finding
of
failure
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
that
would
be
8
(a)
(5).
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
well
--
question
number
one
judge
warren,
whether
on
the
context
of
the
continuing
impasse
and
an
ultimate
breakdown
of
negotiations
both
caused
by
union
and
employer
violates
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(5)
etcetera,
by
following
its
longest
established
standard
practices
known
and
discussed
with
the
union.
that's
a
factual
question.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
we
know
that
judge
but
we
say
we
didn't
do
those
things.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
we
say
we
didn't
do
those
things
and
we
say
that
the
records
sustain
our
position.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
we
don't
object
to
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
if
--
i
say
again
if
that
--
if
the
threshold
question
is
resolved,
we
don't
have
to
come
to
the
other
question.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
well,
the
court
of
appeals
disagrees
with
the
factual
findings
of
the
board
in
the
respect
that
they
don't
come
to
the
conclusion
on
the
basis
of
the
good
faith
section
of
the
amended
act
that
we,
on
an
overall
basis,
violated
anything
and
they
send
back
to
the
board
the
determination
of
that
question.
so
apparently,
the
court
did
not
come
to
any
conclusion.
it
would
appear
that
way
to
me.
now,
i
want
to
get
down
to
the
question
of
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
determination
on
the
issue
of
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(5)
can
be
made
on
a
basis
of
per
se
violations
or
must
it
be
in
the
totality
of
all
of
the
conduct
of
the
employer.
i'd
like
to
point
out
and
we
have
referred
to
this
in
our
brief
on
pages
20
and
21
that
only
recently
in
an
address
by
a
member
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
gerald
brown,
i
think
it
was
at
duke
university,
he
agreed
that
the
board
should
now
determine
cases
not
on
a
per
se
basis
but
on
the
basis
of
the
formula
enunciated
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
insurance
agents
case.
now,
this
is
a
member
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
making
a
speech
of
very,
very
recent
vintage.
and
i
say
that
this
contrary
to
the
statements
of
the
solicitor,
he
does
not
speak
for
his
client.
his
client
has
spoken
completely
at
odds
with
him.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
well
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
he's
--
he
might
and
for
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
well,
he
might
--
he
says
that
this
is
the
policy
the
board
should
pursue
and
he's
a
member
of
the
board,
judge
frankfurter
and
i
think
that
this
should
carry
considerable
weight
in
--
in
indicating
the
present
day
thinking
as
of
this
moment
that
they
do
know
longer
adhere
to
the
old
view
before
the
amendment
of
the
act
to
the
per
se
violation
but
they
are
rather
now
dealing
on
the
basis
of
a
totality
of
the
record.
now,
we
have
referred
to
his
--
we
have
quoted
some
of
these
comments
where
he
says
on
page
21
and
we
have
highlighted
that.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
i
think
the
solicitor
general
has
the
full
text.
it
seemed
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
oh
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
i
want
to
refer
to
some
of
the
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
i
beg
your
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
may
i
proceed?
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
i
would
like
to
refer
to
some
of
the
state
--
some
of
the
con
--
cases
as
cited
by
the
solicitor
in
the
argument.
and
he
cites
for
instance
the
borg-warner
case.
i
think
judge
frankfurter
in
his
opinion
in
the
insurance
agents
case
on
page
509
distinguished
the
borg-warner
case
in
pointing
out
that
in
borg-warner
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
oh
no,
i'm
not
--
i'm
just
referring
to
certain
sections
of
it.
but
i
know
your
honor
wrote
the
opinion
on
the
case
on
that.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
i'm
not
saying
this
by
way
of
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
yes.
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
no,
i'm
not
relying
on
the
concurring
opinion.
i'm
quoting
from
the
concurring
opinion.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
well,
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
if
i
may
say
so,
the
concurring
opinion
went
a
little
further
in
elucidating
on
what
the
affect
of
the
amendment
of
section
8
(d)
was
and
its
application
to
present
day
collective
bargaining.
and
it's
only
in
that
posture
that
i
want
to
refer.
i'm
not
by
--
i
know
that
the
decision
itself.
your
opinion
judge
brennan
spoke
about
section
8
(d)
and
that
the
amendment,
the
effect
of
it.
but
i
think
in
the
concurrent
opinion,
it
was
a
little
more
elucidation
on
the
subject
and
that
was
the
only
reason
that
i
made
reference.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
it
elucidated
the
court
opinion.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
you
don't
want
me
to
act
as
a
judge,
do
you?
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
not
that
i
know
off
judge
frankfurter.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
i
would
like
in
connection
with
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
the
further
argument
of
mr.
--
of
solicitor
general
point
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
well,
in
other
words,
i'm
in
agreement
with
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
opinion
of
judge
waterman
and
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
707,
he
refers
or
rather
he
quotes
from
an
article
written
by
the
solicitor
general
entitled
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith,
71
harvard
law
review
1401,
1424
and
--
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
like
general
brown.
mr.
sidney
o.
raphael
yes.
now,
i
--
i
sincerely
feel
that
in
the
light
of
the
amendment,
section
8
(d)
and
specifically
considering
the
fact
that
the
board
refused
to
go
along
with
the
trail
examiner
on
the
good
faith
issue
that
i
think
it
was
perfectly
proper
and
appropriate
in
order
to
have
a
complete
record
with
complete
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
which
i
think
this
record
was
devoid
off
in
the
light
of
section
8
(d)
for
the
court
to
have
issued
its
mandate
in
sending
the
case
back
to
the
board
for
the
adoption
of
further
evidence.
and
in
the
phase
of
that,
i
think
that
your
honors
should
affirm
the
order
of
the
court
below.
i
thank
you
very
much
for
the
time
you've
given
me.
