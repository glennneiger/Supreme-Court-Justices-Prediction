is
a
finding

justice

what's
the
object
in
it?
i
thought
i
agreed
to
the
court
opinion.
i
didn't
know
that

justice
hugo
l.

do
you
mean,
elucidated
the
court
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
that
you're
abandoning
your
request
at
the
end
of
your
brief,
that
this
be
remanded
with
directions
to
have
a
decree
enforcing
the
board's
order.
you
used
--
you
have
a
footnote
there
about
the
little
instant
that
you
mentioned
about
times
(voice

indicating
that
that's
not
officially
important
to
--
inquiring
any
difference
as
to
this
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
want
to
delay
this
but
i
do
--
this
all
occurred
and
there
was
reference
to
that.
what
you're
really
arguing
is
that
a
finding
of
bad
faith
is
not
indispensable
to
the
findings
which
the
conclusion
which
board
reached,
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that's
it
and
suppose
it
would
be
affirmed,
it's
not
--
it's
not
indispensable.
as
i
understand
it,
he's
arguing
is
under
the
universal
camera
doctrine,
taken
as
a
whole,
looking
at
the
whole
record,
the
board
has
already
--
the
court
has
already
decided
that
it
will
not
enforce
the
order
under
the
--
the
universal
camera
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
want
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
make
my
problems
clear
as
i
thought
you'd
raise
it
as
this.
as
i
understand
your
argument
is
in
effect
with
reference
to
8
(b)
(5)
that
this
is
the
equivalent
of
a
finding
of
the
board
that
they
refused
the
bargaining.
that's
the
equivalent
of
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
refused

bargain

yes,

ahead.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
have
they
passed
on
it
then
without
that
element?
have
they
reached
