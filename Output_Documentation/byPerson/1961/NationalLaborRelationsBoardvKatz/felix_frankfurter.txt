justice

frankfurter
may
i
--
just
going
to
ask
whether
you
want
a
full
enforcement,
you
don't
--
you
disagree
with
the
qualification
of
judge
lumbard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there's
one
member
of
the
board
who
speaks
for
his
--
for
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
member
would
speak
--
speak
for
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
full
text
of
the
speech
to
be
found
in
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wanted
the
citation.
i
didn't
want
for
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
be
glad
to
have
the
facts
in
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me
for
interrupting.
was
this
--
or
was
this
released
by
the
board
or
by
the
speaker
or
in
fact
some
--
is
that
a
case
the
other
day
which
involved
knowing
what
--
who
speaks
to
whom?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
read
it
without
being
a
part
of
the
(inaudible)
the
nlrb
on
the
new
frontier
that
--
that's
not
a
technical
term,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
a
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
got
a
rule
against
referring
to
a
concurring
opinion,
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
only,
you
do
refer
to
the
dissenting
opinion
but
concurring
opinion
have
a
lower
status.
justice
felix
frankfurter
its
shorter
(inaudible)--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
unless
i'm
wrong,
you
--
the
phrase
per
se
didn't
come
in
your
main
argument,
is
it?
i
don't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
i'm
usually
in
leery
of
phrase
so
i
want
to
know
what
per
se
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
i
want
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
a
very
--
not
a
very
embracing
rule
of
law
because
of
this
kind
and
--
what
was
the
other
adjective
or
the
other
qualification
under
these
circumstances?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
you
deemed
to
be
the
rule
of
law
which
will
guide
a
case
coming
up
before
the
board,
the
tuesday
following
the
monday
this
case
goes
out
in
your
favor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
know
that
it
(voice
overlap)--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
leaves
open
considerable
area
of
discretion
or
at
least
of
--
of
judgment
determination
--
determination
by
judgment
whether
an
impasse
has
been
reached.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
know
in
the
international
field,
we
think
an
impasse
has
been
reached
and
no,
no,
no,
has
been
said
and
two
weeks
later,
somewhat
rather,
yes,
it
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
questions
were
left
open?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
seek
for
--
if
you
seek
full
enforcement
and
you
do
not
even
give
to
judge
lumbard
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
so
what
is
left
open?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
think
it
was
desirable
or
undesirable
to
use
the
phrase
per
se
except
with
such
particularity
of
description
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
on
which
the
order
of
the
board
rested
that
there
wouldn't
be
anything
per
se
except
to
this
particular
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
it
did.
i'm
just
--
if
may
use
any
vulgarism,
leery
of
any
per
se
in
this
model.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
was
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
i
understand
that.
that's
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
ruling
was
--
if
i
may
intervene?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
ruling
was
set
aside
--
and
the
ruling
was
disaffirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
through
the
introduction
from
your
point
of
view
of
a
near
relevant
criteria
namely
good
faith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
refuse
to
enforce
it
by
requiring
an
element
which
as
a
matter
of
law
you
contend
is
not
what
he
requires.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
--
and
fully
understand
the
colloquy
between
you
and
mr.
justice
black.
if
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
on
universal
camera
doctrine
fully
unrelated
to
any
proper
or
improper
principle
or
doctrine
of
law
to
which
--
which
was
--
by
which
the
facts
are
to
be
judged.
if
that
issue
was
opened
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
think
it
was.
i
don't
know
much
about
it.
if
it
was
opened
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
occasion
to
go
on
it
because
they
refused
to
enforce
on
this
illicit
view
about
good
faith,
then
i
should
suppose
in
view
of
what
you
said
you
think
that
that's
still
open
before
them
to
press
before
the
court
of
appeals
taking
out
as
improper
elements,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
aren't
we
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
any
of
--
or
any
other
issue
on
which
the
board
must
face
a
judgment
with
due
regard
to
the
entire
record
as
a
matter
of
evidence
stripped
of
any
irrelevant
or
inadmissible
doctrine
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
makes
a
--
presuming
that
you
should
prevail
on
that
--
on
the
main
issue
which
you've
argued,
effects
what
this
court
is
to
do
in
sending
the
case
back.
justice
felix
frankfurter
making
clear
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
isn't
for
us
to
say
what
issues
were
or
were
not
opened
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
for
--
from
its
point
of
view
has
had
no
occasion
to
canvass.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
