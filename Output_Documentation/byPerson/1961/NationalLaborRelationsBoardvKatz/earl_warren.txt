chief

earl
warren
mr.
raphael,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
raphael,
may
i
ask
this
--
this
question,
do
we
have
to
review
all
these
facts
to
decide
this
case
or
do
we
just
have
to
decide
whether
--
whether
the
--
the
board
has
a
right
to
make
such
a
--
an
order
without
finding
that
the
company
intended
to
recruit
bargaining?

(voice

--
if
we
don't
have
to
follow
--
if
we
don't
have
to
review
all
these
facts,
it
seems
to
me,
we
ask
the
very
narrow
question
of
law,
does
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
the
--
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do
with
the
findings
of
the
board?
does
it
disagree
with
the
factual
findings
of
the
--
of
the
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
the
court
below
is
right
though,
we
don't
have
to
review
all
these
facts,
do
we?
if
the
court
below
is
right
from
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
law,
then
it
would
in
fact
goes
back
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
alright.
now
if
we
don't
--
if
we
don't
agree
with
it,
isn't
it
a
just
question
of
law
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
--
if
it
needn't
be
subjective
but
only
objective
wouldn't
that
be
the
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
what
--
what
question
that
do
you
--
do
you
raise
here
on
your
--
how
do
you
state
the
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
the
question
presented
in
the
petition,
the
one
on
which
you
granted
cert
is
this,
whether
there
is
a
violation
to
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
when
prior
to
the
discontinuance
of
collective
bargaining
negotiations
in
the
existence
of
an
--
of
a
possible
--
any
possible
impasse,
an
employer
without
notice
to
or
consultation
with
the
employees'
bargaining
representative
unilaterally
places
in
effect
new
wage
rates
substantial
in
excess
of
those
offering.
the
representatives
changes
the
sick
leave
policy
and
grants
numerous
merit
increases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
object
then
to
the
findings
of
the
board
and
the
--
and
the
findings
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
court
of
appeals,
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
where
does
--
where
does
the
court
of
appeals
designate
it
with
the
findings
--
the
factual
findings
of
the
board.

warren
you
may
continue

mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
general,
there
was
--
i'm
a
little
confused
just
a
few
moments
ago,
i
understood
you
say
that
when
this
case
goes
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
you
suggest
that
it
does
that
there
are
certain
things
open
to
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
heard
--
understood
you
at
the
beginning
to
say
that
all
you
--
that
you
wanted
both
compliances.
and
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
just
--
we
sent
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
both
compliance.

justice
earl
warren

see,
i
see.
