that's
what
i
thought.

i
don't
see
why

justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
refusal
--
they
are
these
decisions
all
that
--
that
unilateral
action
of
this
kind
is
a
refusal
to
bargain?
justice

--
decisions
hold
both,
is
that
it?
justice

define
what
the

stewart
--
rule
ought
to

stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
unilateral
action
of

kind
and
magnitude
taken

is
reached

right.

stewart
what
circumstances

justice
potter
stewart
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
was
wondering
if
you
were
thinking
of

regardless
of
what
was
actually
going
on
at
the
bargaining
table,
your
--
your
rule,
your
--
the
rule
you
contend
for
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
apply
whether
or
not
and
regardless

the
fact
that
the
employer's
representatives
were
sitting
down
day
