it

is
it?

j.
brennan,

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
3
through
267.
i'm
going
to
advert
to
something
which
appears
on
pages
26
--
on
page
265
known
as
general
notes.
item
one,
“
no
employee
shall
lose
any
benefits
or
suffer
any
reduction
of
salary
by
virtue
of
the
signing
an
application
of
agreement.”
from
that
moment
on,
we
were
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
for
this
reason.
the
evidence
in
the
case
disclosed
and
this
was
a
rather
lengthy
trial.
i
tried
this
case
before
the
board,
before
trial
examiner
and
the
issue
was
controverted
except
that
i
would
say
with
respect
to
what
i
am
about
to
tell
the
court
now,
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
controvertible
issue
and
that
is
that
this
company
like
a
lot
of
other
prominent
companies
in
its
field,
without
necessity,
have
to
have
and
it
did
have
a
wage
and
salary
cut,
with
merit
reviews,
promotions,
classifications,
etcetera.
this
is
especially
true
in
the
case
of
professional
employee
such
as
engineers,
designers,
draftsmen,
who
were
within
--
who
were
in
this
bargaining
unit.
you
are
unable
to
keep
people
of
that
caliber
unless
there
was
some
sort
--
sort
of
a
progression
system.
now,
we
had
this
merit
review
system,
we
have
these
demands
and
the
union
says,
“do
not
take
anything
away.”
so
the
minute
we
do
it,
we're
charged
with
infringing
upon
the
union's
prerogative.
however,
as
it's
pointed
out
in
judge
frankfurter's
opinion
in
the
insurance
agents
case
and
then
judge
waterman's
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
case,
an
employer
was
torn
between
two
poles.
he's
got
to
bargain
with
the
union
collectively
in
good
faith.
but
by
the
same
token,
he's
got
a
business
to
run
and
you've
got
to
be
realistic,
you've
got
to
be
practical.
so
you're
--
you're
walking
a
tight
rope
which
is
well-oiled
and
greased
and
god
know
if
you
fall
down.
and
this
is
the
posture
that
we
find
the
basic
facts
of
this
case
to
be
framed.
now,
far
from
the
contention
which
i
have
heard
voiced
by
--
by
the
solicitor
general
that
there
might
be
an
inference
of
sham
bargaining.
your
honors
i
say
to
you,
this
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
there
was
long,
intensive
bargaining
and
many
sessions
that
went
on
for
a
period
for
about
nine
months
or
10
months.
and
every
time
we
met,
we
lived
up
to
the
word
of
samuel
(inaudible).
we
gave
each
and
--
on
each
and
every
occasion
more
and
more
until
finally
in
april
or
may
1957
and
this
is
in
the
record,
we
gave
the
union
improved
vacations,
improved
holidays
or
17
and
a
half
dollar
package
spread
over
a
period
of
three
years.
we
gave
them
progressions.
well,
you
mentioned
it,
we
gave
it,
that
was
the
patent
of
our
so-called
sham
bargaining.
and
the
reason
i
illustrate
that
is
because
it
is
not
without
reason
that
the
board
refused
to
go
along
with
the
trial
examiner's
findings
and
conclusions
that
there
was
an
absence
of
good
faith
or
let's
put
it
on
another
way
that
there
was
bad
faith
in
the
bargaining
by
this
employer.
with
this
finding,
the
board
did
not
go
along.
and
it
is
in
this
general
cradle,
in
this
crucible
that
we
must
now
draw
the
line
between
the
former
doctrines
ever
enunciated
before
the
amendment
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1947
and
those
that
follow.
the
decision
which
was
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
are
all
decisions
that
were
pre-taft-hartley,
medo,
all
these
other
cases
were
pre-taft-hartley.
section
8
(d)
which
was
the
subject
matter
of
considerable
discussion
both
in
congress
both
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate
and
which
finally
there
was
joint
conference
report,
both
agreed.
they
wanted
to
eliminate
once
and
for
all
the
tenuousness
of
an
employer's
position
when
it
came
to
collective
bargaining.
in
other
words,
how
far
did
you
have
to
go?
at
what
point
could
you
say
that
there
was
an
impasse?
at
which
point
did
you
give
all
you
could
possibly
give?
at
what
point
was
there
good
faith
or
bad
faith?
did
you
have
to
come
to
a
collective
agreement
in
order
for
somebody
to
say
to
you,
“you're
not
guilty
of
bad
faith?”
so
they
enacted
section
8
(d).
so
these
decisions
or
these
opinions
which
were
referred
to
by
the
petitioner
are
in
acts
and
as
judge
frankfurter
roughly
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
insurance
agents
case,
there
was
a
distinction
between
those
cases
which
preceded
and
those
which
followed
the
amendment
to
the
taft-hartley
law,
section
8
(d).
that
leads
us
now
to
the
principle
facet
of
this
case,
because
if
we
conclude
as
i
believe
we
should
in
the
face
of
the
present
decisions
and
the
amendment
of
the
act
section
8
(d)
then
there
is
justification
for
judge
waterman's
decision,
because
then
we
cannot
isolate
and
fractionate
some
--
what
i
would
call
de
minimis
because
these
little
violations
that
were
committed
on
this
case
and
the
overall
posture
of
all
the
facts
was
in
the
nature
of
de
minimis
violations,
that's
exactly
what
it
was.
they
were
clinging
to
a
straw
in
order
to
sustain
these
charges
because
despite
what
they
say
that
we
changed
the
sick
leave
and
i'll
assume
arguendo
that
we
did,
and
i
might
say
that
we
did
because
the
record
abounds
with
evidence
that
this
was
not
a
change
that
diminished
anything.
this
was
a
change
to
prevent
the
constant
abuses
which
we
had
not
only
with
the
professional
employees
but
with
our
white
collar
personnel
and
they
numbered
into
the
hundreds.
they
were
simply
misusing
the
privilege
that
we
gave
them.
so
we
didn't
take
anything
away,
but
we
added
an
incentive
to
what
they
had
in
order
to
avoid
the
continuance
of
this
general
bad
relation
which
we
had.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
raphael,
is
there
any
--
nothing
about
the
court
opinion
in
the
insurance
agents
that
has
a
bearing
on
the
problems
here,
is
it
only
the
concurring
opinion
on
which
it
would
consult?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
important
if
i
wrote
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
suggesting
you
are
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
the
court
below
as
i
understood
it
relied
on
insurance
agents
and
that
is
the
court
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
relying
on
the
concurring
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
new.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
the
court
opinion
didn't
use
it
because
they
don't
think
its
--
if
it
was
irrelevant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
know
you're
not
alone
mr.
raphael.
the
solicitor
general
thought
that
the
concurring
opinion
was
particularly
helped
pursuant
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apparently
that
was
the
question
asked.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'd
like
the
speech
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
members
of
the
board
the
same
idea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor,
you're
not
--
i
gather
you
don't
believe
that
whatever
limitation
on
the
universal
camera
there
maybe
on
this
court's
review
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
had
anything
whatever
to
do
with
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
