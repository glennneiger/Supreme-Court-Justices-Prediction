mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
labor
board
case
hereon
certiorari
to
review
a
judgement
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
order
of
the
board
found
the
respondent
guilty
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
of
refusing
to
bargain
collectively
and
of
interfering
with
the
employee's
rights
of
self-organization
and
collective
bargaining.
the
order
directed
the
respondent
to
cease-and-desist
and
also
required
to
bargain
with
the
union
as
the
representative
of
the
employees
for
reasonable
period.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
stated
in
general
terms
is
whether
it
violates
section
8
(a)
(1)
or
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
for
an
employer
during
negotiations
with
a
labor
union
chosen
as
their
representative
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
to
take
unilateral
action
changing
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
without
notifying
or
consulting
the
union
and
at
a
time
when
it
goes
with
the
union
desires
to
bargain
on
those
subjects.
and
takes
this
action
i
should
add
before
there
was
an
impasse
in
the
negotiations.
the
facts
upon
which
this
question
is
presented
were
all
found
by
the
trial
examiner
and
the
board
and
were
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
also
respondent's
brief
sets
forts
quite
a
different
version
based
on
its
reading
of
the
evidence.
the
findings
of
the
board
i
think
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
in
any
event
that
question
is
not
here.
the
employer
manufactures
metal
doors
and
the
frames
and
i
guess
the
panels,
things
of
that
kind
in
which
they
are
set
and
admittedly
ships
its
product
in
interstate
commerce.
among
its
employees,
there
was
a
group
of
about
50
draftsmen
and
technicians
whom
the
board
found
to
be
an
appropriate
bargaining
unit.
it's
certified
a
labor
union,
local
66
of
the
american
federation
of
technical
engineers
as
the
exclusive
representative
of
the
employees
in
that
unit
after
an
election.
there
was
a
delay
in
starting
negotiations
because
the
employers
did
not
of
course
reply
to
the
union's
levy.
but
on
the
30th
of
august,
negotiations
began.
it's
unnecessary
to
describe
the
negotiations
in
any
great
detail
because
the
board's
findings
rested
on
three
specific
acts.
it's
enough
to
say
i
think
that
there
were
beginning
in
august
and
running
on
through
october
and
november,
for
the
first
part
of
december,
a
series
of
bona
fide
meetings.
then
there
was
a
long
interruption
at
the
suggestion
of
the
new
york
state
mediation
board
and
there
were
a
series
of
additional
bargaining
meetings
beginning
in
the
end
of
march
and
running
through
the
end
of
may
when
negotiation
reached
an
impasse.
during
that
time
and
according
to
the
findings
of
both
the
trial
examiner
and
the
board
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
there
was
no
impasse
in
the
negotiations.
but
the
employer
nevertheless
took
three
steps
which
were
found
by
the
board
to
violate
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(5).
the
first
related
to
sick
leave.
this
employer
had
had
a
plan
for
the
benefit
of
its
employees
before
the
union
came,
of
granting
sick
leave
with
pay
up
to
10
days
a
year.
if
at
the
end
of
a
calendar
year,
an
employee
hadn't
used
up
that
sick
leave,
he
could
carry
it
forward
into
--
into
the
next
year
up
to
a
total
of
20
accumulated
days.
if
you
had
more
than
20
days
of
accumulated
sick
leave,
you
began
to
loose
it.
you
were
paid
for
50%
of
the
excess
days,
but
you
lost
the
other
50%
so
that
an
employee
carried
forward
say
30
days,
he
could
accumulate
20.
he
would
be
paid
for
five
and
he
would
lose
the
other
five.
on
march
11,
during
a
recess
in
the
negotiations,
but
during
the
general
period
in
which
negotiations
were
admittedly
going
forward
and
there
had
been
no
break
down.
the
respondent
made
a
unilateral
change
having
the
sick
leave.
it
reduced
the
days
of
sick
leave
that
could
be
carried
forward.
it
did
liberalize
the
--
and
it
reduced
the
days
of
sick
leave
per
year,
but
it
did
liberalize
up
on
the
amounts
of
payment
for
accumulated
and
unused
sick
leave.
that's
--
that
action
was
taken
as
i
have
said
without
any
notice
to
the
union,
without
any
consultation
to
the
union
and
indeed
when
the
union
objected,
the
employers
said
there
is
no
need
for
us
to
consult
for
you
about
this.
we're
denying
your
right
to
be
notified
or
to
be
heard.
this
was
one
of
the
actions
which
the
trail
examiner
and
the
board
found
to
violate
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
(5).
second
in
april,
as
negotiations
were
still
in
progress
and
according
to
the
findings
still
before
there
was
any
impasse,
the
employer
put
into
effect
somewhat
higher
wage
rates,
more
favorable
wage
trades
perhaps
i
should
say
than
had
prevailed
before,
and
is
true
and
frequently
in
paying
engineering
employees,
draftsmen
and
other
technicians.
this
company
had
a
rather
broad
range
of
wage
rate
rather
typical
event
might
be
for
an
employee
to
be
hired
in
comparatively
untrained
and
unfamiliar
with
this
employer's
need,
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale,
say
around
$55
or
$60
a
week.
and
as
he
learned
the
employer's
needs,
as
he
demonstrated
the
skill
and
was
put
on
more
responsible
work,
he
might
be
increased.
the
practice
had
apparently
been
to
review
the
status
of
employees
and
this
unit
every
six
months
or
so
and
to
grant
them
increases
up
to
a
considerably
higher
level.
now
what
the
employer
did
in
april
was
to
guarantee
the
review
of
wages
at
certain
periods,
was
to
guarantee
certain
step
increases
automatically,
all
of
which
were
favorable
than
any
offer
which
had
previously
been
made
to
the
union.
the
trail
examiner
and
board
found
that
this
unilateral
action
violated
the
statute
and
was
therefore
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
third
subject
on
which
unilateral
action
taken
was
the
so-called
merit
increases,
that
is
increases
given
to
individual
employees
within
the
wage
rate.
during
october
and
again
in
january,
this
employer
gave
wage
increases,
first
to
roughly
30
and
then
in
january
roughly
20
of
the
employees
without
consulting
the
union,
knowing
that
the
union
wished
to
bargain
about
the
subject.
i
would
emphasize
that
these
were
not
just
few
employees.
the
merit
increases
ran
to
approximately
50
which
were
all
the
employees
of
the
unit
and
therefore
we
think
amounted
very
closely
to
a
general
wage
increase
during
the
negotiations
and
before
an
impasse
was
reached.
the
trial
examiner
found
that
each
of
these
three
instances
of
unilateral
action
was
a
refusal
to
bargain
collectively
and
was
an
interference
with
the
rate
of
the
employees
to
bargain
collectively.
he
went
on
and
said
that
these
instances
of
unilateral
action
demonstrated
that
the
respondent
had
been
marked
--
merely
going
through
the
motions
of
collective
bargaining
without
a
genuine
intention
of
trying
to
negotiate
an
agreement.
and
he
rejected
as
i
have
said
the
notion
that
any
impasse
had
been
reached
prior
to
may
of
this
year,
and
held
that
the
act
had
been
violated.
he
went
on
and
recommended
an
order
directing
the
employer
to
cease-and-desist
from
such
unilateral
action
and
to
bargain
with
the
union
which
been
while
either
as
a
result
of
the
unfair
labor
practices
or
otherwise
had
lost
the
support
of
the
majority
of
the
employees.
when
the
matter
came
before
the
board,
it
approved
for
the
most
part
the
trial
examiner's
finding.
specifically,
it
found
that
no
impasse
was
reached
until
sometime
in
the
middle
of
may
after
these
instances
of
unilateral
action
had
occurred.
it
found
that
there
was
no
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
union
which
was
responsible
for
the
difficulty
in
the
negotiations
as
had
the
trial
examiner.
and
it
ruled
that
the
unilateral
action
was
a
violation
of
the
act.
its
finding
is
differed
from
those
of
the
trial
examiner
in
that
it
rejected
specifically
the
trial
examiner's
finding
that
the
respondent
had
merely
been
going
through
the
motions
of
collective
bargaining.
it's
said
that
that
finding
was
not
permissible
to
be
made,
because
the
complaint
had
not
been
drafted
on
the
theory
that
the
respondent
was
not
acting
in
good
faith.
and
it
ruled
that
this
conduct
was
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(5),
regardless
of
the
employer's
subjective
state
of
mind.
it
approved
on
the
basis
of
its
finding
the
order
that
had
been
recommended
by
the
trial
examiner.
the
essence
of
the
decision
below
which
set
aside
the
board's
order
appears
in
volume
2
of
the
record,
at
page
439.
the
court
said,
at
the
top
of
the
page
and
i
think
it's
worth
calling
this
court's
attention
to
it,
where
opinion
for
unilateral
action
here
complained
of
occurring
as
they
did
during
the
negotiating
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
do
not
per
se
constitute
a
refusal
to
bargain
collectively
and
per
se
are
not
violative
of
section
8
(a)
(5).
while
the
subject
is
not
generally
free
from
doubt
our
conclu
--
it
is
our
conclusion
that
in
the
posture
of
this
case,
a
necessary
requisite
of
the
section
8
(a)
(5)
violation
is
a
finding
that
the
employer
failed
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
circuit
judge
lumbard,
one
of
the
three
members
of
the
panel,
dissented
from
this
opinion
and
would
in
substantial
--
to
a
substantial
degree
have
enforced
the
board's
order.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
we
want
a
full
enforcement.
but
we
there
find
his
reasoning
is
under
main
issue
substantially
correct.
we
think
that
the
court
below
is
wrong
and
that
it
misconceived
the
essential
duties,
lay
down
employers
and
to
a
degree
labor
unions
also
that
was
not
involved,
by
sections
8
(a)
(5)
and
8
(b)
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
our
view,
the
gist
of
the
duty
imposed
on
an
employer
by
those
provisions
and
on
a
union
where
the
union's
duty
to
bargain
collectively
is
involved,
is
to
established
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
jointly.
the
whole
thrust
of
the
statute
is
an
effort
to
substitute
for
what
had
previously
been
the
employer's
fight
either
because
he
took
unilateral
action
or
because
of
individual
bargaining
a
regime
founded
on
mutual
consent.
and
any
conduct
which
like
unilateral
action
reject
his
totalling
inconsistent
with
the
notion
of
substituting
a
foundation
of
agreement
for
the
employer's
hipsy-dixy
in
fixing
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
is
in
our
view
a
violation
of
the
act.
the
fundamental
error
of
the
court
of
appeal
--
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
was
in
a
quite
--
in
supposing
that
all
duties
under
section
8
(a)
(5)
were
determined
simply
by
the
employer's
good
faith
by
his
subjective
state
of
mind.
that's
a
useful,
indeed
an
essential
test
in
determining
whether
he
is
just
going
through
the
motions,
whether
the
bargaining
is
a
sham.
but
the
fact
that
is
important
in
some
instances
does
not
make
it
the
sole
touchdown
by
which
to
measure
the
legality
of
all
conduct.
and
i
shall
give
the
court
in
the
course
of
my
argument
a
number
of
instances
in
which
it
is
quite
plain
that
the
question
of
good
faith
is
not
involved
and
that
an
employer
or
indeed
a
labor
union
maybe
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain
collectively
regardless
of
its
subjective
state
of
mind.
we
find
support
for
this
position
which
i
have
tried
to
summarize
very
briefly
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
in
the
philosophy
of
collective
bargaining,
which
some
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
tell
us,
has
been
incorporated
into
the
statute
and
in
the
precedent
not
only
of
this
court,
but
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
board,
which
i
would
--
should've
supposed
it
settled
the
precise
question
involved
here
for
at
least
20
years.
the
words
of
the
statute
to
which
i
shall
direct
myself
first,
appear
conveniently
at
page
39
of
our
brief.
section
8
(a)
(5),
it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
representatives
of
his
employees
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
9
(a),
9
(a)
appears
over
on
page
41.
representatives
designated
or
selected
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
the
unit
appropriate
for
such
purposes
shall
be
the
exclusive
representatives
of
all
the
employees
in
such
unit,
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargain
with
respect
to
rates
of
pay
and
so
forth.
this
principle
of
majority
rule
imposes
what
justice
stone
called
certain
negative
obligation,
the
negative
obligation
to
refrain
from
fixing
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
by
other
methods
than
through
collective
bargaining
with
the
majority
representative.
let
me
interpolate
once
again
that
i
am
speaking
of
the
situation
before
an
impasse
is
reached.
once
there
has
been
an
impasse
the
duties
of
the
employer
and
the
date
of
the
union
maybe
changed.
but
there
is
the
negative
duty
as
chief
justice
stone
said
to
refrain
from
other
conduct
inconsistent
with
collective
bargaining
that
just
established
by
the
principle
of
majority
rule.
it's
a
duty
to
refrain
not
only
from
bargaining
with
other
unions
but
to
refrain
from
bargaining
with
individuals
and
we
think
quite
plainly
also
a
duty
to
refrain
from
unilateral
action
since
that
attempt
to
fix
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
by
a
different
method
than
the
statute
ordains
and
describes
as
exclusive.
in
addition,
we
think
that
the
section
8
(d)
which
defines
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively
gives
literal
support
to
our
view.
section
8
(d)
at
the
bottom
of
page
39,
for
the
purposes
of
this
section
to
bargain
collectively
is
the
performance
of
the
mutual
obligation
of
the
employer
and
the
representative
of
the
employees
to
meet
at
reasonable
times
and
conferred
good
faith
with
the
respect
to
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
that
--
those
words
to
me
at
reasonable
times
in
conferring
good
faith
with
respect
to
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
applies
to
each
and
every
subject
of
collective
bargaining.
for
example,
it
is
well-settled
that
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
bargain
about
sick
leave
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
even
though
he
was
bargaining
incomplete
good
faith
about
each
and
every
other
subject
of
employment.
it's
equally
well-settled
that
to
refuse
to
bargain
about
bare
increases
even
though
the
employer
is
bargaining
in
good
faith
about
other
subjects
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
this
is
well-settled
by
decisions
of
this
court
and
others.
now,
i
submit
too
that
it
is
equally
plain
that
the
duty
to
meet
and
confer
involves
meeting
and
conferring
about
what
might
be
called
temporary
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
supposed
for
example
the
union
said,
but
i
think
it
is
arising
most
naturally
in
a
large
establishment,
it's
going
to
take
us
six
months
before
we
can
workout
all
the
details
of
a
contract.
meanwhile,
we
want
a
temporary
sick
leave
arrangement,
something
that
will
operate
in
the
interim.
if
the
employer
said,
“no,
i
won't
bargain
about
the
temporary
sick
leave
arrangement
to
operate
in
the
interim
regardless
of
his
good
faith
in
meeting
and
discussing
sick
leave
to
begin
six
months.”
hence,
i
submit
that
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
under
the
plain
words
of
section
8
(d).
now,
if
you
add
those
two
together,
the
duty
to
bargain
on
every
subject
and
the
duty
to
bargain
about
temporary
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
it
follows
by
inevitable
logic
i
think
that
there
has
been
a
failure
to
bargain
about
sick
leave,
a
failure
to
bargain
about
this
wage
increase
and
about
the
merit
increases
here,
because
the
employer
whether
had
and
put
something
into
effect
without
consulting
the
union,
which
certainly
a
failure
to
meet
and
confirm
and
when
he
knew
that
the
union
was
seeking
to
bargain
on
this
subject,
there
was
in
effect
a
refusal
in
the
most
literal
sense
of
the
word.
furthermore,
i
may
point
out
the
employer
knew
perfectly
well
in
this
case
that
he
was
rejecting
the
union's
right
to
participate
with
respect
to
the
change
in
sick
leave.
when
the
union
letter
--
wrote
a
letter
protesting
the
change
of
sick
leave
in
march,
the
employer
replied
by
a
letter
dated
march
16,
1957,
which
appears
in
volume
1
of
the
record.
i'm
reading
from
page
270,
“we
do
not
feel
obligated
to
explain
the
matter
to
you
or
anyone
else
since
we
are
not
as
yet
to
bound
to
you
until
an
agreement
has
been
reached
between
us.
and
with
the
actions
that
you
have
used
thus
far
is
doubtful
when
such
agreement
will
be
consummated."
over
toward
the
end
of
the
letter,
"there
is
no
need
to
explain
to
you
what
we
have
done.
we
have
no
obligation
to
you.”
well,
of
course
the
statute
does
impose
an
obligation
to
consult
with
the
union
about
these
benefits.
i
rested
thus
far
on
the
words.
we
also
find
support
for
dispute
and
perhaps
more
importance
support
in
the
philosophy
of
collective
bargaining.
the
philosophy
of
collective
bargaining
has
always
condemned
unilateral
action
for
three
reasons.
in
the
first
place
as
i
suggested
at
the
outset,
the
basic
postulate
of
collective
bargaining
is
the
right
of
employees
to
participate
in
decisions.
this
has
been
set
forth
in
the
literature
in
the
field
going
back
at
least
to
a
dr.
william
(inaudible)
writing
in
1920,
when
he
spoke
of
collective
bargaining
as
achieving
a
partnership.
when
we
have
such
a
partnership,
he
said,
two
equal
partners
then
one
partner
cannot
do
anything
without
consulting
the
other.
this
basis
was
carried
on
through
into
the
enactment
of
the
statute
and
one
finds,
we've
quoted
some
on
our
brief
many
expositions
of
the
same
period
later.
the
second
reason
that
the
philosophy
of
collective
bargaining
has
always
rejected
unilateral
action
is
that
unilateral
action
is
inconsistent
with
the
practicalities
of
collective
bargaining.
one
can't
build
a
house
on
shifting
sands.
one
can't
negotiate
a
contract
if
the
basis,
the
taking
off
place
is
subject
to
sudden
changes
without
notice
to
the
other
side,
consider
the
difficulties
of
trying
to
negotiate
a
pension
plan
or
health
and
welfare
plan
covering
sickness,
accident
insurance
and
the
like,
if
the
employer
were
free
following
a
long
night
of
negotiation
suddenly
to
announce
the
next
morning,
well
i
put
a
plan
into
effect
and
while
we'll
go
on
talking,
we'll
have
to
start
all
over
again.
again
of
course
for
the
employer
to
take
unilateral
action,
greatly
lessens
the
flexibility
of
collective
bargaining
and
the
employee's
opportunities
to
participate.
if
the
employer
increases
his
unit
labor
cost,
let's
say
5
cents
an
hour
by
putting
a
pension
plan
into
effect
that
the
employee's
opportunities
to
bargain
for
increase
vacations
or
for
higher
wages
or
for
some
other
benefit
are
necessarily
reduced.
true
in
theory
the
pension
plan
may
be
revoked.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
one
doesn't
wipe
out,
afraid
to
comply
so
easily.
third,
unilateral
action
necessarily
disparages
the
bargaining
process
and
undermines
the
union.
if
the
employer
advanced
the
employer
when
he
makes
a
unilateral
change
is
saying
to
the
employees,
“see,
this
union
certification
makes
no
difference.
i'm
going
out
on
in
conducting
myself
as
before.”
if
this
happened
here
with
the
sick
leave,
he
takes
away
some
of
the
employee's
benefits,
this
will
look
and
often
be
an
act
of
reprisal
for
bringing
the
union.
if
he
gives
more
than
he
is
ever
offered
the
union
as
happened
here
in
the
case
of
the
wage
increase
in
april
which
exceeded
what
he
had
offered
the
union,
he's
in
effect
saying,
“see,
i
will
give
you
more
alone
than
you
can
obtain
and
collective
bargaining
through
the
union.”
third,
we
submit
that
this
question
has
been
decided
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
that
they
did
as
i
said
earlier
settled
the
question
many
years
ago.
the
leading
cases
on
the
subject
are
j.i.
case
company
and
the
medo
photo
supply
case.
in
the
medo
photo
supply
case,
there
were
the
employees,
it
was
rather
small
bargaining
unit
went
directly
to
the
employer
after
a
majority
had
chosen
a
bargaining
representative
and
indeed
filed
a
representative
who
was
still
acting
for
them.
and
they
said,
“we
would
like
you
to
give
us
directly
as
employees
a
wage
increase.
and
if
we
get
the
wage
increase,
we
won't
want
the
union.”
the
employer
replied
after
thinking
it
over,
“you
can
do
it
what
you
like
about
the
union,
but
i'm
happy
to
give
you
the
wage
increase.”
in
an
opinion
by
justice
stone,
it
was
held
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
act
and
i
think
his
words
are
important
enough
to
impose
on
the
court
by
reading
a
short
passage.
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
essential
principle
of
collective
bargaining
and
an
infringement
of
the
act
for
the
employer
to
disregard
the
bargaining
representative
by
negotiating
with
individual
employees
whether
a
majority
or
a
minority
with
respect
to
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
which
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
case
case.
bargaining
carried
on
by
the
employer
directly
with
the
employees
whether
a
majority
or
minority
who
had
not
revoked
their
designation
of
a
bargaining
issue
would
be
subversive
of
the
mode
of
collective
bargaining
which
the
statute
has
ordained
such
conduct
is
therefor
an
interference
with
the
rights
guaranteed
by
section
8
(1)
of
the
act.
unilateral
action
i
submit
is
exactly
the
same
in
this
respect
as
bargaining
with
individual
employees.
indeed,
that
very
question
came
before
the
court
in
the
may
department
stores
case.
a
case
which
can
be
distinguished
because
it
could
have
gone
on
the
ground
that
the
employer
refused
even
to
meet
and
negotiate
with
the
union.
but
he
had
taken
unilateral
action
and
it's
significant
that
the
court
dealt
with
the
unilateral
action
as
such,
saying
employer
action
to
bring
about
changes
in
wage
scales
without
consultation
and
negotiation
with
the
certified
representative
of
its
employees
cannot
we
think
logically
or
realistically
be
distinguished
from
bargaining
with
individuals
or
minorities,
and
then
went
on
again
to
interfere
--
point
out
that
this
interferes
with
the
right
of
self-organization.
and
finally
the
point
was
squarely
ruled
on
in
the
crompton-highland
mills
case
a
few
years
later
where
an
employer
had
done
very
much
with
this
employer
here
did
granted
a
wage
increased
to
the
employees
when
negotiations
have
gotten
difficult.
indeed,
they'd
rate
something
of
an
impasse
in
that
case
which
was
greater
than
any
increase
it
had
been
willing
to
offer
through
the
union.
now
i
said
that
the
basic
fallacy
of
the
court
below
in
my
judgement
was
attempting
to
make
the
employer's
state
of
mind
that
the
sole
test
of
whether
what
is
complied
with
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(5).
i
would
like
to
dwell
on
that
just
a
moment
and
to
show
where
it
seems
to
me
that
this
question
of
subjective
good
faith
is
relevant
and
where
it
is
not
relevant.
section
8
(a)
(5)
is
a
short
provision.
i
also
think
if
the
law
of
collective
bargaining
is
something
standing
like
an
inverted
pyramid
on
that
various
small
base
because
this
is
a
large,
complicated
body
of
law
and
it
doesn't
reduce
itself
to
one
simple
touch
of
it.
i
should
say
that
there
were
at
least
three
groups
of
problems
which
it
was
important
to
have
in
mind
in
aligning
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
first
to
those
cases,
cases
of
the
kind
that
i've
been
talking
about
that
deal
with
the
status
of
the
union
and
they
established
one
of
the
collective
bargaining
as
the
exclusive
method
of
fixing
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
upon
a
foundation
of
mutual
consent.
in
this
area,
the
concept
of
good
faith
has
just
no
--
or
almost
no
role
to
play.
the
only
case
i
can
think
of
where
it
comes
has
any
pertinent
is
where
the
employer
when
there's
been
no
election
and
certification
refuses
to
bargain
on
the
ground
that
he
doubts
whether
the
union
has
majority.
then
it
is
said
if
he's
doubt,
he's
entertained
in
good
faith.
he's
not
guilty
of
unfair
labor
practice
even
if
it
happened
that
the
union
had
the
majority.
but
in
all
other
cases,
good
faith
does
--
doesn't
have
anything
do
with
it.
suppose
for
example,
if
the
employer
as
in
the
may
department
stores
case,
challenges
the
board's
determination
of
the
appropriate
unit
in
complete
good
faith.
that's
not
a
defense
if
he
is
wrong.
if
the
employer
refuses
to
bargain
with
the
union
--
with
a
particular
union
official
on
the
ground
that
he's
personally
objected
--
objectionable
to
the
employer,
but
he's
willing
to
bargain
in
good
faith
with
other
union
official.
that
has
been
held
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
enforcing
the
negative
duties.
as
i
suggested
earlier,
the
duty
to
refrain
from
bargaining
was
a
minority
unit,
good
faith
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
in
--
if
the
employer
bargains
with
individuals
when
there's
a
majority
representative
he
violates
the
act
regardless
of
his
good
faith
otherwise
in
talking
to
the
union.
similarly,
when
one
deals
with
the
questions
in
the
area
which
can
be
defined
by
asking
a
question,
what
are
the
required
subjects
of
collective
bargain?
as
i
suggested
earlier,
the
employer,
he
refuses
to
bargain
on
a
statutory
subject
is
guilty
of
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(5)
regardless
of
his
subjective
state
of
mind.
and
indeed
in
the
borg-warner
case,
this
court
held
that
if
he
insists
on
bargaining
on
something
outside
the
statutory
subject
he
violates
section
8
(a)
(5)
regardless
of
the
good
faith
in
which
he
carried
on
the
negotiations
on
the
other
subject.
so
in
this
area
i
suggest
on
the
good
faith
is
immaterial.
now,
it
becomes
important
in
a
class
of
cases
that
came
to
the
attention
of
lower
courts
into
a
lesser
degree
to
this
court
of
very
early
after
the
enactment
of
the
act.
some
employers
would
meet
and
confer
with
the
union
and
negotiate,
and
negotiate,
and
negotiate
and
gradually
talk
the
union
to
death.
it
became
important
to
distinguish
the
sham
from
the
real.
now,
that
is
a
type
of
problem
in
which
an
inquiry
into
one
subjective
state
of
mind
is
meaningful
and
the
test
to
achieve
great
importance
in
this
area.
the
third
group
of
cases
arose
from
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
tendency
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
comparative
to
the
recent
years
to
restrict
the
substantive
position
an
employer
might
take
on
statutory
subjects
of
collective
bargain.
or
to
attempt
to
regulate
the
way
he
should
conduct
himself
in
carrying
on
the
negotiations
looking
to
a
joint
determination
of
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
the
first
of
those
cases
was
the
american
national
insurance
company
case
where
it
was
held
by
a
majority
of
the
court
that
an
employer
was
free
in
response
to
a
union's
request
for
an
arbitration
clause
to
bargain
for
managements'
prerogatives
to
make
certain
decisions
in
the
area
of
collective
bargaining
for
itself.
the
board
held
--
the
board
argued
that
for
the
employer
to
take
that
position
was
per
se
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
court
responded,
“no,
the
board
is
not
set
up
to
police
the
substantive
positions
that
an
employer
may
take.”
if
it
has
accepted
collective
bargaining,
if
it
is
negotiating
with
the
union
then
the
test
with
respect
to
its
positions
is
whether
it
is
acting
in
good
faith.
now,
the
insurance
agents
case
of
which
the
court
below
seems
considerably
to
have
relied
on
dealt
not
with
the
substantive
position
but
with
--
if
i
were
to
put
it
bluntly,
the
weapons
that
the
union
might
use
in
attempting
to
gain
its
bargaining
demand.
and
the
court
held
that
the
weapons
that
the
union
used
weren't
--
could
not
because
they
were
contrary
to
traditional
ways
or
were
--
might
be
thought
against
public
policy
or
otherwise
undesirable
or
indefensible
on
the
board
phrase
was
not
a
ground
for
per
se
branding
a
refusal
to
bargain
collectively.
the
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
additioning
--
the
questioning
some
of
the
breadths
of
the
majority
opinion
emphasizes
i
take
it
to
point
that
while
this
could
not
be
held
to
be
per
se
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(5),
the
tactics
that
the
union
resorted
to,
the
timing
with
which
it
resorted
to
such
tactic
might
in
a
proper
context
lay
the
foundation
for
a
finding
that
the
union
did
not
have
the
proper
subjective
state
of
mind.
there
is
nothing
in
our
position
here
that
quarrels
in
any
with
that
reasoning
because
--
mr.
archibald
cox
either
opinion
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
both,
both.
i
was
referring
to
the
concurrent
opinion.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
it
end
up
a
fortiori.
there's
no
--
nothing
here
that
quarrels
to
the
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
as
long
as
it's
--
as
long
as
we
don't
quarrel
with
it
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
understand
that
--
maybe
i
spoken
too
quickly.
the
point
i
would
make
mr.
justice
stewart
about
the
opinion
of
the
court,
is
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
insurance
agents
case
took
specific
note
of
this
problem
related
it
quite
profitably
to
the
problem
of
the
bona
fide
recognition
of
the
union
as
an
equal
participant
in
fixing
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
and
then
in
the
next
sentence
the
majority
opinion
says,
“an
employer's
unilateral
wage
increase
during
the
bargaining
processes
tends
to
subvert
the
union's
position
as
the
representative
of
the
employee's
in
matters
of
this
nature
and
has
hence
been
condemned
as
a
practice
violative
of
this
statutory
provision.”
and
we
think
that
that
statement
is
amply
supported
by
the
earlier
decisions
of
the
court.
i've
cited
in
my
brief
a
wealth
of
circuit
court
opinions
going
back
into
the
mid-1940's
squarely
holding
that
unilateral
action
under
these
circumstances
as
unfair
labor
practice.
the
board's
own
opinions
consistently
have
reached
that
conclusion
for
quite
a
year
and
we
think
therefore
that
the
judge
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
a
refusal
to
bargain
and
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
mr.
archibald
cox
both.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
held
both.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
only
qualification
that
i
need
to
state
to
that
is
that
there
is
some
language
in
the
--
i
see
that
in
medo
or
may
department
stores
case
which
does
speak
only
of
8
(a)
(1)
but
the
ensuing
concluding
finding
and
the
board's
order
listed
both
section
and
the
board
has
always
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
always
treated
it
as
a
violation
of
both.
we
would
argue
just
to
be
clear
on
the
point
justice
stewart
that
this
unilateral
wage
increase
of
an
amount
greater
than
was
offered
to
the
union
could
also
be
sustained
independently,
because
whether
one
is
satisfied
that
this
was
technically
a
refusal
to
bargain,
certainly
it
does
disparage
the
bargaining
process,
does
undermine
the
union's
position
and
therefore
interferes
with
the
right
to
bargain
collectively
under
section
8
(a)
(1).
but
they've
normally
been
lumped
together
as
violation
of
both
section.
i'd
like
to
save
anytime
i
have
left
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
what's
the
sect
--
section?
i
don't
think
it's
--
i
don't
think
it's
fully
printed.
we'll
get
other
copies
for
the
court
if
it
wishes.
and
i've
just
handed
one
with
the
marshal.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
was
up
without
(inaudible).
i
believe
that
this
is
put
out
by
the
board's
press
relations
office
as
they
speak
through
a
single
member.
mechanically,
it
emanates
from
the
board's
headquarters
that
each
individual
speaks
for
himself.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
take
it
a
joke.
my
association
does
not
permeate
the
doctrine
of
the
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
any
extended
reply
is
necessary
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
say
one
word
to
make
our
position
clear
about
some
of
the
questions
of
fact
that
have
been
raised.
mr.
raphael's
arguments
on
the
facts
are
quite
contrary
to
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiner
and
of
the
board.
and
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
those
finding
to
be
correct
and
our
position
of
course
is
that
the
case
is
to
be
decided
here
on
the
basis
of
those
findings
of
what
questions
maybe
open
to
mr.
raphael
when
the
case
goes
back
as
we
think
it
should
to
the
court
of
appeals.
or
whether
he
then
can
argue
that
there
was
a
lack
of
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
findings
and
so
forth
is
not
a
question
presently
here.
we
think
there
was
substantial
evidence
and
i
see
no
reason
to
discuss
it.
so
far
as
mr.
brown's
opinion
goes
--
speech
goes,
i
think
the
court
will
find
nothing
in
there
which
is
in
anyway
inconsistent
with
the
argument
made
on
behalf
of
the
board
here
or
with
the
general
philosophy
that
i
have
sought
to
express.
mr.
archibald
cox
we're
contending
that
unilateral
action
of
the
magnitude
involved
here
during
negotiations
while
the
union
is
seeking
to
bargain
of
the
substantives
and
before
an
impasse
has
been
reached,
it
is
per
se
a
violation
of
the
duty
to
bargain
and
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
mr.
archibald
cox
the
answer
is
yes.
the
qualification
i
put
in
was
purposeful.
it
is
a
rankle
which
frankly
has
always
troubled
me.
there
are
certainly
some
minor
instances
of
unilateral
action
which
it
must
be
possible
to
take.
suppose
the
farmer
--
as
far
as
a
worker
punches
a
farmer
in
the
nose
and
surely
the
employer
can
get
him
out
of
the
plant
even
though
negotiations
were
going
forward.
and
i
--
therefore
didn't
--
i
wanted
to
limit
myself
to
unilateral
action
of
this
magnitude
prior
to
an
impasse
during
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
negotiation.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
applied
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
certain
things
--
mr.
archibald
cox
as
applied
to
certain
things,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
without
any
questions,
absolutely.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
didn't
use
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
didn't
use
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
take
it
that
it
means
that
this
act
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
and
of
themselves
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
regardless
of
the
employer's
state
of
mind
are
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
mr.
archibald
cox
is
a
failure
to
collectively
bargain
regardless
of
the
employer's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
state
of
mind.
mr.
archibald
cox
at
section
8
(a)
(1).
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
didn't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
contend
that
for
an
employer
to
take
unilateral
action
of
substantial
magnitude
or
something
like
that.
i'm
trying
to
exclude
the
discharging
the
thought.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
that
for
employer
to
take
unilateral
action
to
change
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
archibald
cox
bargainable
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
at
a
time
when
the
employees
have
designated
a
bargaining
representative
and
when
the
bargaining
representative
is
seeking
to
bargain
on
those
subjects
and
when
no
impasse
has
been
reached
is
regardless
of
the
employer's
state
of
mind
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
think
i
would
go
--
i
don't
think
i
would
go
that
far.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
--
i
would
have
to
--
without
being
more
precise,
i
would
think
the
union's
conduct
might
be
a
relative
circumstance.
if
the
union,
while
seeking
to
bargain
was
conducting
in
itself
a
way
that
made
it
practically
negotiate
--
practically
impossible
to
carry
on
negotiations,
i
would
think
that
would
raise
a
different
issue
(voice
overlap)
before
this
court
on
the
findings
of
the
board.
that's
the
--
that's
the
chief
area
in
which
i'm
uncertain.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
just
don't
--
i
don't
think
of
any
other
justice
stewart.
i'm
not
trying
to
evade
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
but
i
--
i
just
hesitate
to
state
it
more
broadly
than
the
case
needs
to
--
be
required.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
for
example,
let's
suppose
that
the
employer's
representative
was
sitting
down
day
after
day
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
bargaining
in
--
mr.
archibald
cox
complete
good
faith
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
with
a
union
which
has
been
certified
to
represent
all
the
employees
is
the
plant-wide
union.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
he's
bargaining
with
that
union
in
complete
good
faith.
it
goes
out
and
bargains
with
the
union
representing
the
pattern
makers,
a
small
group
at
the
same
time.
he's
violated
the
statute,
perfectly
clear
because
he
is
obliged
to
concentrate
on
fixing
terms
and
conditions
in
negotiations
with
the
majority
representative
and
each
unit
would
include
the
pattern
maker.
again,
if
he
goes
and
bargains
with
individual
employee,
even
though
he
sits
down
day
after
day.
now,
i
am
saying
following
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
insurance
agents
case
that
unilateral
action
is
like
bargaining
with
the
minority
union
or
individual
bargaining.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
i
think
the
--
i
think
that
is
certainly
true,
and
there's
--
there's
room
for
an
area
of
judgment
and
discretion.
i
think
the
point
here
is
clear
that
the
act
after
the
--
an
effort
has
been
made
to
fix
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
by
joint
determination.
and
if
that
doesn't
work,
the
employer
has
to
have
an
opportunity
to
run
his
plant.
and
a
variety
of
circumstances
if
he
was
one
of
five,
who
would
always
follow
the
same
wage
pattern
and
they
were
competing
with
each
other
for
skilled
machinists,
the
time
when
he
can
move
unilaterally,
by
it
become
much
quicker,
might
come
much
quicker
than
in
a
situation
like
this
one.
but
here,
we
have
an
explicit
finding
that
there
was
no
impasse
and
indeed
two
of
these
instances
of
unilateral
action
came
one
very
early
in
any
negotiations,
one
during
a
recess
at
the
request
in
the
state
mediation
board.
and
so
i
think
there's
--
on
the
findings
made
by
the
trial
examiner,
the
board
and
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
there
is
--
this
is
the
case
where
there
is
no
impasse.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suppose
this
would
be
--
i've
--
i
had
assumed,
this
is
--
what
we
seek
is
finally
an
order
enforcing
the
--
is
a
decree
enforcing
the
order
of
the
board.
i
suppose
this
court's
mandate
would
be
reversed
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings
in
accordance
with
its
opinion.
now,
there
may
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
what
questions
were
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
deal
to
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
envisaging
this
possibility.
i
don't
think
it's
a
very
real
one
but
i
don't
see
that
we
can
argue
that
it's
foreclosed.
the
argument
is
made
here
by
the
respondent
that
there
was
a
--
so
long
a
period
of
delay
between
the
events
in
question
and
the
issuance
of
this
order
that
the
order
could
bargain
with
the
union
should
not
in
any
event
have
been
enforced
that
conditions
have
changed
too
much.
that's
the
contention
which
may
--
i
don't
know,
may
have
been
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
may
not
have
been
passed
upon
by
it
and
it
would
seem
to
me
on
the
remand
on
that
ground
for
challenging
the
decree
of
the
order
of
the
board
might
still
be
available.
and
--
but
i
was
really
thinking
to
emphasize
was
that
those
other
possible
grounds
of
attacking
the
order
as
to
which
i
really
say
nothing
aren't
before
this
court.
indeed,
that
one
would
require
a
change
in
the
order
and
this
court
under
its
rules
to
jurisdiction
wouldn't
have
power
to
deal
with
it.
that
was
all
i
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
seeking.
if
he
has
other
grounds
for
attacking
it
that
are
not
related
to
this
question
of
unilateral
action
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(5),
i
suppose
he
still
can
present
them
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
possible,
yes.
that's
--
that's
really
all
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
right.
that
is
what
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
all
i
intended
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
suggest
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
the
board
reported
to
adopt
its
narrow
rule
as
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
think
the
rule
--
i
think
the
rule
per
--
the
expression
per
se
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
an
unfortunate
expression.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
do
think
that
my
case
requires
--
made
to
convince
the
court
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
statute
here
regardless
of
the
employer's
state
of
mind.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
suppose
that
our
request
if
there
are
any
other
points
that
were
raised
did
not
pass
on
below,
it
would
seem
to
me
as
i
stand
here
mr.
justice
black,
had
been
phrased
a
little
too
broadly.
i
may
get
trouble
with
my
assistance
when
i
go
back
to
the
office.
but
as
i
stand
here
and
think
of
it,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
he
had
raised
some
other
points
in
the
court
below
that
weren't
passed
on,
that
he's
still
entitled
to
preserve
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
universal
camera
doctrine
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
means
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
entitled
to
look
at
the
board
order
and
then
say,
“well,
taking
everything
into
account
but
we
decide
not
to
enforce
it.”
i
take
it
that
the
expression
relates
to
the
findings
of
fact
and
to
the
question
whether
there
is
evidence
to
support
the
findings
of
fact
and
this
would
include
particular
findings.
and
that
the
effort
was
to
compress
what
was
believed
to
--
by
the
congress
and
some
experts
to
be
the
prior
practice
in
picking
and
choosing
bits
of
evidence
to
support
finding
in
contrast
with
an
effort
to
determine
whether
the
evidence
is
substantial,
viewed
in
the
light
of
its
context
to
other
element.
but
i
don't
think
this
goes
simply
to
a
general
power
to
enforce
or
not
enforce
a
board
order
depending
on
your
judgment
of
the
record.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
of
it's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
it
was
a
ruling
of
law
that
they
had
refused
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
to
bargain.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
based
upon
the
finding
that
they
took
these
three
unilateral
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
they
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
set
up.
they
misinterpreted
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
as
i
read
the
opinions,
they
did
not
consider
perhaps
because
they
were
not
asked
whether
the
board's
findings
were
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
they
accepted
them.
i
don't
want
by
saying
that
this
question
is
theoretically
available
to
cast
any
doubt
on
them,
but
i
am
convinced
through
my
study
of
the
record
that
there
is
substantial
evidence,
more
than
substantial
evidence.
mr.
archibald
cox
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
nothing
to
do
with
this.
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
not
at
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
see
why
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
to
--
let
me
just
to
be
sure
that
i
am
clear
because
i'm
a
little
worried.
maybe
i
didn't
understand
you.
let
us
suppose
that
the
respondent
were
in
a
position
to
claim
that
the
work
was
an
impasse
in
december,
1956
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
board's
finding
that
it
occurred
in
may.
i
take
it
that
when
the
case
goes
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
he
can
again
oppress
that
attack
on
the
board's
finding
that
the
impasse
was
in
may,
and
that
that
question
isn't
properly
here
at
all.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
--
i
would
suppose
that
the
proper
mandate
was
reversed
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
his
opinion.
mr.
archibald
cox
--
which
would
make
it
clear
what
the
rule
of
law
is
and
that
the
court
below
weigh
down
an
erroneous
rule
of
law
and
leaving
the
petitioner
any
other
contentions
either
based
on
the
inadequacy
of
the
evidence
or
other
rules
of
law.
i
don't
think
of
any
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
but
if
he
think
of
one
why
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
seem
they
weren't
open
to
may,
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you.
