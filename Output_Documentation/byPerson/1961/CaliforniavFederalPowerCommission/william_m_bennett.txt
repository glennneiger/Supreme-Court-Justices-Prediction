mr.
william
m.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
members
of
the
court.
this
is
a
case
which
has
grave
issues
in
it.
it's
a
case
which
is
of
some
length
and
it's
a
case
in
which
the
gravity
of
the
errors
can
be
understood
only
by
a
comprehensive
and
complete
understanding
of
the
facts.
the
facts
are
of
great
significance
because
they
demonstrate
the
gravity
of
the
three
errors
which
i
maintain
exist
in
this
record.
i
maintain
that
the
power
commission
in
this
case
erroneously,
unlawfully
and
excessive
jurisdiction
decided
an
antitrust
question
not
given
to
them
to
decide.
i
maintain
that
the
federal
power
commission
absent
evidence
or
upon
inadequate
evidence
adopted
an
erroneous
standard
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
in
this
case,
and
i
maintain
that
california
and
other
interveners
in
this
case
were
denied
a
fair
hearing
and
due
process
because
of
things
done
improperly
or
because
of
things
omitted
to
be
done
and
because
of
things
done
outside
of
the
record
in
this
case.
and
so
at
the
beginning,
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
we're
concerned
here
with
three
principal
characters
in
this
drama
of
corporate
intrigue.
we're
concerned
with
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
which
at
that
time
of
this
case
was
the
sole
out-of-state
supplier
of
natural
gas
in
the
state
of
california.
it
is
a
company
with
a
capitalization
of
about
$1,300,000,000.
it
has
a
utility
plant
in
service
of
approximately
$800,000,000.
it
delivers
two
billion
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
to
the
state
of
california
on
an
average
basis.
it
collects
approximately
$300,000,000
on
an
annual
basis
from
the
state
of
california
and
it
did
this
at
the
time
of
this
case
without
competition
from
any
other
pipeline.
it
operates
a
pipeline
system
extending
6700
miles
in
length.
it
extends
from
mexico
to
canada.
it
extends
from
oklahoma
to
california
and
it
traverses
the
rocky
mountain
states.
this
growth
and
this
size
which
is
relevant
to
this
case,
was
caused
by
--
and
i
don't
say
this
with
any
degree
of
criticism
was
caused
by
the
growth
of
the
state
of
california.
california
with
its
16
million
people
and
its
five
million
gas
consumers
is
the
number
one
gas
consuming
state
in
the
united
states
of
america.
and
california
as
a
state
is
unique
with
reference
to
natural
gas.
this
is
not
a
luxury
item.
this
is
not
an
automobile
you
may
buy
or
choose.
this
is
natural
gas
which
you
must
have
whether
you
are
a
householder
whether
you
are
an
industrialist.
it
is
essential
to
daily
life
in
california
presently
and
even
more
essential
when
we
look
into
the
future.
california
does
not
have
coal.
this
heightens
the
dependence
upon
natural
gas.
the
homes
of
california
are
not
so
constructed
that
the
householders
of
california
may
revert
to
fuel
oil.
the
industry
of
california
even
such
industry
as
is
adopted
to
converting
the
fuel
oil
on
given
days,
peak
days
as
we
call
them,
generally
speaking
may
not
reject
natural
gas
and
utilize
fuel
oil
because
of
small
ordinances
or
small
gloss.
for
example
in
the
county
of
los
angeles,
from
may
until
november,
the
burning
of
fuel
oil
is
prohibited.
this
heightens
the
necessity
and
the
need
of
my
state
for
natural
gas.
80%
of
the
natural
gas
sold
by
the
el
paso
natural
gas
is
purchased
by
the
gas
distributing
utilities
in
california
and
they're
in
turn
distributed
and
pass
on
the
rates
and
charges
to
the
ultimate
consumers.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
your
honor
is
a
regulated
natural
gas
company.
it
operates
an
interstate
natural
gas
pipeline.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
it
does
many
other
things.
it
has
22
subsidiary
corporations.
it
explores
and
develops
for
oil
and
gas.
it
has
a
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
it's
also
a
gas
producer
on
its
own
right.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
and
a
pipeline.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
it
sells
to
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
in
the
north,
the
largest
utility
in
the
united
states;
it
sells
to
the
pacific
lighting
companies
in
southern
california,
the
largest
single
gas
distributing
utilities
in
the
untied
states.
it
has
two
customers
in
the
state
of
california
both
gas
distributing
utilities.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
it
sells
directly
to
large
industrial
users
in
the
states
of
arizona
and
i
believe
new
mexico.
it
makes
no
direct
sales
in
the
state
of
california.
it
comes
to
the
california
border
and
its
transmission
stops
at
that
point.
it
is
picked
up
by
our
gas
distributing
utilities.
i
point
out
the
size
of
el
paso,
i
point
out
the
situation
with
reference
to
california
because
they
will
become
exceedingly
relevant
as
i
get
into
the
argument
which
i
am
about
to
make
here
and
after.
now,
the
third
corporation
in
this
case
is
the
pacific
northwest
pipeline
corporation.
this
is
a
corporation
formed
in
1949
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
or
obtaining
a
certificate
from
the
federal
power
commission
authorizing
it
to
transmit
natural
gas
through
an
interstate
pipeline,
and
it
made
a
showing
in
support
of
that
application
that
it
filed
to
get
this
certificate.
the
showing
was
believed
by
the
commission
and
on
june
30th,
1954,
the
federal
power
commission
in
a
decision
and
order
found
that
the
pacific
project
would
be
economically
feasible,
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest.
and
the
pacific
northwest
pipeline
was
planned,
conceived,
engineered,
designed
and
constructed
to
serve
the
states
of
washington,
oregon,
idaho,
wyoming,
utah
from
a
point
on
the
western
border
between
canada
and
the
untied
states
extending
down
through
washington,
oregon,
they're
entering
over
down
on
through
the
rocky
mountains
and
terminating
in
the
san
juan
basin
in
the
state
new
of
mexico.
this
was
the
area
and
the
root.
it
was
designed
and
authorized
to
serve.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
misspoke
myself,
your
honor.
i
referred
to
three
characters
in
this
drama
and
one
of
those
actors
is
the
state
of
california
not
a
corporate
actor,
however.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
but
these
are
the
three
principles
to
this
point
in
the
case.
now,
pacific,
as
i
said,
received
the
authority
from
the
commission
to
operate
this
pipeline
to
build
it.
and
this
was
done
upon
the
showing
and
the
belief
that
the
commission
had
that
this
would
be
a
good
pipeline
economically
feasible
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
it
was
authorized
to
construct
and
operate.
and
in
april
of
1955,
the
year
after
it
acquired
the
certificate,
its
financing
was
completed.
apparently,
the
investors
had
some
confidence
in
the
project
as
it
was
proposed
to
be
operated.
commencing
in
1955,
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
commenced
to
make
overtures
toward
the
founders,
the
incorporators
and
the
manage
--
management
of
pacific
seeking
to
acquire
it
upon
some
basis
or
other.
the
map
discloses
and
the
record
in
this
case
discloses
that
at
this
time
when
pacific
in
1954
received
its
certificate,
there
were
no
other
pipelines
serving
gas
to
the
state
of
california.
but
while
pacific
was
authorized
to
serve
in
the
states
of
the
pacific
northwest,
the
very
fact
of
it
serving
in
those
states
and
the
very
fact
that
it
was
to
extend
its
line
to
portland,
oregon
put
it
in
a
position
to
furnish
gas
to
the
state
of
california
if
it
could
make
arrangements
with
california
gas
distributing
utilities.
so
that
at
this
point,
the
factor
of
competition
was
created
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
el
paso
people
begin
efforts
to
acquire
the
pacific
northwest
pipeline
company.
so
far
specific
is
concerned,
there
was
never
any
question
in
--
in
its
mind
that
it
could
be
competitive
to
el
paso
and
that
it
could
furnish
gas
to
the
california
markets.
mr.
fish,
the
founder
of
pacific
testified
in
this
record
that
they
considered
the
california
market
as
being
available
to
them.
mr.
fish,
the
founder
of
the
pacific
company
came
to
california
in
may
of
1956.
he
talked
to
the
president
of
the
southern
california
edison
company.
he
asked
him
whether
or
not
they
could
get
together
on
a
gas
purchase
contract.
so
serious
with
these
negotiations
that
they
entered
into
a
letter
agreement
providing
for
the
delivery
of
300
million
cubic
feet
to
the
edison
company
from
the
gas
reserves
of
canada
which
pacific
northwest
had.
this
agreement
was
not
consummated,
however.
now,
the
reasons
were
not
particularly
nor
clearly
known
but
the
reasons
are
suggested.
the
president
of
el
paso
learning
of
the
fact
that
negotiations
were
going
on
between
pacific
and
mr.
quentin
and
mr.
fish,
pacific
and
the
southern
california
edison
company
came
to
california,
discussed
these
negotiations
with
--
with
mr.
quentin,
told
them
he
would
oppose
such
a
project
and
said
such
a
project
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest.
this
is
in
the
record
which
is
before
this
court.
now,
i
can't
say
that
this
is
why
the
edison
company
of
california,
a
large
electric
distributing
utility,
did
not
consummate
these
arrangements.
we
can
never
know
that
and
we
could
not
find
it
out
before
the
commission
but
it
certainly
is
an
inference
one
can
draw.
now,
the
record
before
the
commission
on
that
regard
shows
that
when
i
crossed
examined
mr.
kayser
of
el
paso
as
to
his
interest
in
this
arrangement
between
the
edison
company
and
the
pacific
company,
that
he
said
in
answer
to
a
question,
“i
said
it
was
not
in
the
public
interest
for
him,”
meaning
mr.
quentin
“to
buy
his
gas
on
a
direct
purchase
outside
and
bring
it
in
to
the
detriment
of
the
business
of
the
southern
california
gas
companies.”
and
i
asked
him,
“when
you
referred
to
the
public
interest
at
that
time,
did
you
also
have
in
mind
el
paso's
interest
or
was
it
entirely
just
public
interest?”
answer,
“i
had
in
mind
both.”
and
then
dropping
down,
“you
also
told
him,
you
would
oppose
pacific
northwest,
didn't
you?”
answer,
“i
cannot
say
that
i
said
that.”
“well,
would
you
mind
thinking
very
hard
about
that
and
recalling
whether
you
said
it
or
did
not.”
answer,”
well,
i
don't
remember
saying
it.”
“well,
is
it
possible?”
answer,
“oh
i
could
have
said
it
sure.”
and
this
i
might
observed
was
the
question
put
to
him
by
an
attorney
from
california
and
not
the
attorney
from
the
antitrust
division
in
an
almost
casual,
unprepared
pleasant
bit
of
cross-examination
but
with
none
of
the
resources
that
the
antitrust
division
might
have
had
upon
this
point
at
that
particular
time.
so
that
in
any
event,
there
was
competition,
real
potential,
actual
between
pacific
in
the
north
and
el
paso
in
the
south,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
in
its
decision
so
found
although
it
said
it
wasn't
that
kind
of
competition
which
could
outweigh
considerations
coming
from
the
clayton
act.
there
is
also
evidence
of
other
competition
in
the
record.
for
example,
in
the
ana
field
which
is
a
gas
field
in
the
southwest
part
of
the
united
states,
the
record
shows
that
when
the
transwestern
company,
another
pipeline
which
does
now
come
to
california
as
does
pjt
now
come
to
california.
i
want
to
make
that
clear
that
in
that
case
when
the
transwestern
people
were
trying
to
get
gas
to
build
up
their
reserves
in
order
to
make
a
showing
to
justify
the
getting
of
a
certificate
from
the
federal
power
commission,
that
el
paso
competed
for
that
gas.
the
transwestern
people
bid
14
cents
then
the
bid
went
to
17
cents
then
the
reserves,
the
gas
went
to
el
paso
at
20
cents.
and
here,
you
have
the
interesting
phenomena
of
a
bid
for
gas
of
pushing
up
for
the
price,
all
of
it
serving
to
increase
the
rates
and
charges,
the
cost
of
purchased
gas
of
the
el
paso
company
which
got
the
gas
ultimately
and
all
of
it
of
course
going
to
further
increase
the
heights
--
the
heights
to
which
the
cost
of
produce
gas
has
risen
and
all
of
which
of
course
ultimately
will
be
paid
--
paid
for
by
the
consumers
as
operating
expenses
and
under
the
law
properly
so
even
though
this
might
have
been
prevented.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
this
decision
to
merge
your
honor
does
it
foreclose
them?
i
say
realistically,
yes
for
reasons
which
i
shall
develop
here
and
after.
the
answer
to
that
question
your
honor
despite
the
natural
gas
act
and
coming
from
the
realities
of
life,
from
the
realities
of
federal
regulation
is
yes,
they
are
foreclosed.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
as
a
practical
matter,
yes.
one
other
instance
of
competition
i
should
like
to
recite.
the
westcoast
transmission
company
operates
a
pipeline
in
the
western
part
of
canada
and
it
endeavored
to
deliver
canadian
gas
through
the
pacific
system
into
the
northwestern
states.
as
the
record
shows,
el
paso
injected
itself
into
this
contract
arrangement
between
westcoast
and
pacific
became
a
party
to
a
three-party
contract
and
obtained
the
piece
of
that
gas
as
we
say
and
when
mr.
fish,
the
chairman
of
pacific
described
this
arrangement
to
his
stockholders,
he
described
it
as
meaning,
“that
el
paso's
california
market
will
be
protected
against
the
future
competition.”
the
efforts
which
i've
referred
to
previously
of
el
paso
to
acquire
pacific
continued
and
all
the
time
the
efforts
were
continuing
and
negotiations
were
going
on,
pacific
was
going
head
--
ahead
with
its
building
program.
it
completed
construction
sometime
in
1956
but
in
1965
in
latter
part
of
the
year,
mr.
fish
of
pacific
and
mr.
kayser
of
el
paso
agreed
to
a
stock
exchange
and
a
stock
acquisition
of
pacific
by
el
paso.
and
here
is
where
the
case
has
its
interesting
aspects.
this
wasn't
done
without
resort
to
legal
advice.
apparently,
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
the
legality
of
that
which
was
about
to
be
done
and
so
eminent
counsel
sullivan
&
cromwell
were
asked
about
the
legality
of
this
transaction.
and
this
opinion
and
the
paraphrasing
of
it
is
in
the
record
in
this
case
in
the
exhibits
which
are
before
the
court.
but
el
paso
and
pacific
were
advised,
put
on
notice,
you
might
say,
by
sullivan
&
cromwell
that
statutory
--
statutory
immunity
from
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
is
not
available.
the
matter
was
not
entirely
free
from
doubt
but
nonetheless,
the
transaction
would
appear
to
be
alright
so
far
the
present
law
is
being
construed.
and
it
also
went
on
to
state
that
the
purpose
of
the
transaction
would
be
as
you
have
represented
to
us
in
asking
for
our
opinion.
so
here
was
notice
that
this
thing
was
not
entirely
free
from
doubt.
you
can
waive
the
doubt
in
your
own
minds
as
to
whether
it
was
great
or
small
but
at
least
it
was
noticed.
when
the
offer
was
made
to
the
stockholders
to
--
to
exchange,
they
were
advised
and
the
sec
prospectus
of
november
1956
shows
that
they
were
advised
that
if
they
exchange
offer
is
successfully
consummated,
it
expected
that
pacific
will
continue
to
be
operated
as
a
separate
corporation
and
the
management
of
the
company
has
no
present
intent
of
merging
pacific
into
the
company
or
of
having
the
company
acquire
pacific's
assets.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
on
january
8,
1957,
80%
of
the
stock
of
el
paso
had
been
--
of
pacific
had
been
acquired
by
el
paso
so
that
in
reality,
el
paso
was
now
in
control
of
pacific.
this
was
before
the
end
of
january
1957.
in
that
same
month,
in
that
same
year,
january
1957,
pacific
became
operational
and
it
became
operational
with
el
paso
having
80%
of
its
stock.
several
months
later,
it
had
--
it
had
acquired
99.8%
of
its
stock.
it
became
operational
with
el
paso
owning
80%
of
its
stock
with
the
el
paso
company
taking
the
president
of
el
paso
and
making
him
the
chairman
of
the
pacific
board
with
ten
of
the
directors
of
el
paso
becoming
ten
of
the
directors
of
pacific.
in
short,
pacific
as
of
january
1957
was
not
an
independent
corporation.
its
policies,
its
decisions,
its
actions
were
those
of
el
paso.
those
are
the
realities
of
life.
the
officers
of
pacific
who
recommended
to
their
stockholders
that
this
stock
exchange
offer
was
good
and
indeed
it
was
from
their
standpoint
depute
for
money
considerations
were
not
entirely
free
from
selfish
reasons,
understandable,
but
nonetheless
perhaps
inconsistent
with
the
true
public
interest,
the
true
public
convenience
and
necessity
of
the
rate
payers
of
the
pacific
northwest.
the
california
brief
in
this
case
on
page
15
sets
out
the
directors
and
officers
of
pacific
and
the
common
stock
each
owned.
and
without
mentioning
each
director
and
the
holdings
of
each
look
to
the
fact
that
mr.
fish,
the
director
and
chairman
of
the
board
of
pacific
had
118,892
shares
of
the
common
stock
of
pacific.
and
understandably,
the
handsome
offer
made
was
such
that
the
average
or
perhaps
any
individual
having
this
kind
of
holdings
in
the
face
of
that
kind
of
offer
and
one
of
them
with
the
stock
option
applicable
to
30,000
shares
could
hardly
turn
down
an
offer
such
as
this,
no
matter
what
other
considerations
might
have
entered
his
or
their
minds.
the
department
of
justice,
the
federal
government
enters
the
case
at
this
point
because
of
what
has
gone
before.
they
had
a
curiosity
about
the
stock
exchange
here
and
they
made
inquiry
of
the
el
paso
people.
they
had
meetings
with
them
and
they
ultimately
advised
them
in
july
of
1957,
that
a
complaint
was
going
to
be
filed
charging
that
this
stock
acquisition
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
on
july
the
16th,
after
the
el
paso
people
had
been
notified
of
this
complaint
about
to
be
filed,
the
board
of
directors
of
el
paso
met
and
authorized
the
filing
of
applications
to
the
federal
power
commission.
on
july
22nd,
a
complaint
was
filed
in
utah
charging
violations
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
on
july
22nd
this
was
and
on
august
7th,
applications
were
filed
with
the
federal
power
commission
asking
that
the
very
business
venture,
the
very
stock
acquisition
which
was
attacked
in
utah
be
declared
whole
by
a
federal
agency
here
in
washington
d.c.
now,
it
is
true
that
they
sought
before
the
commission,
the
authority
to
transfer
the
assets
or
the
certificates.
they
never
pretended
to
be
seeking
authority
as
to
the
stock
acquisition.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
oh
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes
i
do,
i
do.
i
maintain
that
this
was
nothing
more
than
a
device
to
utilize
a
federal
agency
to
defeat
the
action
of
the
court
in
salt
lake
city,
utah
and
the
record
in
this
case
doesn't
leave
too
much
room
for
doubt
on
that
score.
the
commission
--
the
commission
in
this
case
found
--
the
commission
found
that
the
decision
to
file
with
the
federal
power
commission
was
considerably
stimulated
by
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
was
prepared
to
file
an
antitrust
suit
against
us.
this
is
in
the
decision
of
the
commission.
the
application
with
the
power
commission
was
filed
on
august
7th,
1957
and
then
a
motion
was
filed
the
court
judge
ritter
in
utah
seeking
to
dismiss
upon
the
ground
of
primary
jurisdiction,
it
was
denied.
this
court
denied
certiorari
from
judge
ritter's
ruling
in
that
case.
the
matter
was
sat
down
for
hearing
before
the
federal
power
commission.
i
filed
a
motion
on
behalf
of
california
asking
the
power
commission
to
stay
itself
because
of
the
confusion
and
difficulty
which
would
arise
and
the
trampling
of
the
public
interest
which
would
occur,
and
that
motion
was
denied.
following
which
hearings
were
held
and
the
decision
of
the
commission
ultimately
was
issued.
now,
the
examiner
found
that
the
commission
had
the
authority
to
authorize
the
transfer
of
one
corporation
certificates
to
the
other
even
in
the
presence
of
things
found
to
violate
the
clayton
act.
he
assumed
a
statutory
authority
which
didn't
exist.
he
refused
to
examine
economic
impact
or
the
effect
of
this
merger
upon
rates
and
charges.
he
refused
to
let
cross-examination
occur
as
to
that,
and
the
commission
adopted
this.
the
commission
was
asked
and
changed
its
mind
in
a
petition
for
rehearing
filed
in
which
the
specific
errors
were
pointed
out
to
it.
and
it
refused
and
the
commission
on
december
10th,
1959
set
the
matter
down
for
argument
and
on
december
23rd,
1959,
it
issued
its
decision.
i
sent
a
telegram
to
the
commission
asking
it
to
stay
its
order
so
that
i
could
take
a
--
an
effective
appeal.
it
was
denied.
i
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
which
i
asked
for
a
stay
of
the
decision
so
that
i
could
take
an
affective
appeal,
and
that
was
denied.
it
was
pointed
out
to
the
commission
in
this
case
from
the
beginning
of
it
until
the
last
time
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
of
it
that
what
it
was
doing
was
harmful
in
terms
of
future
consequences
to
the
public
interest
because
of
what
might
happen
in
the
state
of
utah
when
the
clayton
act
came
on
for
trial
if
we
are
successful
here.
now,
those
are
the
facts
of
the
case,
your
honor.
and
i
should
now
like
to
address
myself
to
what
i
contend
to
be
the
error
of
the
commission
and
of
the
court
below
in
the
manner
in
which
each
disposed
of
the
question
relating
to
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
to
begin
with,
i
don't
think
there's
any
quarrel
with
the
proposition
that
the
commission
must
consider
the
antitrust
laws.
the
city
of
pittsburgh
case
is
rather
clear
on
that.
when
it
passes
upon
public
convenience
and
necessity,
one
of
the
factors
in
that
consideration
or
judgement
is
the
monopoly
question,
and
there
was
a
monopoly
question
in
this
case.
the
commission
in
denying
the
motion,
i
had
filed
to
stay
its
proceedings
until
the
utah
case
terminated,
at
that
point
committed
error.
it
denied
unto
itself,
all
of
the
proofs,
all
of
the
evidence
and
whatever
judgement
might
have
come
out
of
utah
by
electing
to
proceed
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
an
allegation
filed
by
the
chief
law
officer
of
the
united
states
saying
that
this
was
an
unlawful
stock
acquisition.
the
commission
went
ahead.
and
so
we
would
ask
ourselves,
“does
the
directive
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh
case
mean
that
when
the
agency
considers
or
has
to
consider
monopoly
questions
and
antitrust
questions,
it
can
look
to
them
read
them
and
excuse
itself
from
a
duty
to
--
duty
do
anything
more
by
saying
we've
considered
them
or
does
it
have
more
meaning
than
that?”
first
of
all,
the
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
authority
or
at
least
it
thought
it
didn't
at
the
time
this
case
proceeded
before
it.
applicants
didn't
proceed
in
that
premise
nor
did
i,
nor
that
did
the
commission,
the
examiner
nor
anybody
connect
to
the
case
of
that
point.
so
there
was
no
examination,
no
looking
into
all
of
the
arrangements,
facts
and
details
concerning
the
acquisition
of
stock.
the
commission
merely
looked
to
the
acquisition
of
so-called
assets
or
acquisition
of
certificates,
and
it
might
be
said
here
that
california
then
nor
the
public
got
no
hearing
upon
the
lawfulness
of
the
acquisition
of
the
stock.
and
we
could
now
take
ourselves
to
the
next
step
in
this
case
where
judge
prettyman
passed
upon
this.
and
he
said
that
the
stock
acquisition
in
this
case
because
it
was
so
enormous,
99%
of
the
stock
is
really
tantamount
an
asset
acquisition
and
the
asset
acquisition
and
the
stock
acquisition
are
on
the
same
and
it
seems
to
be
implying
that
the
approval
of
the
asset
acquisition
cures
any
deficiencies
and
the
stock
acquisition.
well,
let
us
assume
he
is
correct
and
that
where
the
merger
of
the
stock
acquisition
as
of
sufficient
size
that
that
does
give
the
agency
authority
through
asset
approval
to
approve
impliedly
or
inherently
the
stock
acquisition.
we
then
got
no
hearing
upon
it.
we
got
no
hearing
upon
it
all.
and
interestingly
enough,
the
federal
power
commission
just
recently
as
i
referred
to
our
reply
brief
had
set
down
an
order
to
show
cost,
asking
the
humble
oil
company
and
the
alden
corporation
to
show
them
why
they
should
exchange
stock
one
to
the
other,
in
view
of
the
language
in
the
california
case
and
in
judge
prettyman's
decision,
so
they
are
having
a
hearing
in
that
case.
and
it
seems
to
come
down
to
this.
if
the
commission
was
right
when
it
did
not
inquire
into
the
stock
acquisition
then
we
got
no
hearing
and
properly
so
but
the
record
was
deficient
as
to
whatever
that
might
have
disclosed
in
terms
of
its
duty
to
comply
with
the
doctrine
of
the
pittsburgh
case.
if
judge
prettyman
is
right
and
the
stock
acquisition
and
the
asset
acquisition
are
one
on
the
same,
we
did
not
get
our
hearing.
so
in
either
event,
there
is
error
here.
error
on
the
part
of
the
commission
in
not
doing,
error
as
judge
prettyman
sees
it
in
doing
it.
so
in
either
event,
there
is
error,
in
the
commission
decision
or
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
the
court
below
did
not
precisely
suggest
nor
indeed
would
have
ordered
a
dismissal
of
the
proceedings
in
utah.
but
if
you
relate
what
it
said
to
doctrines
of
primary
jurisdiction
and
matters
of
committee
which
are
inherent
in
this
case,
you
read
into
it
from
his
language
that
the
asset
acquisition
embraces
the
stock
acquisition
and
since
the
latter
is
lawful
that
there's
hardly
any
point
to
looking
into
the
stock
acquisition.
and
the
reality
is
despite
any
legal
through
which
might
obtain
the
reality
is
them
that
when
this
goes
back
to
utah
if
it
does,
that
judge
will
have
a
very
persuasive
thing
in
front
if
him
by
way
of
dismissing
those
proceedings.
and
in
view
of
the
serious
allegations
here,
if
that
event
occurs,
we
will
never
have
had
a
hearing
upon
the
allegations
made
as
to
unlawfulness
pertaining
to
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
it
comes
down
to
that,
your
honor.
it
comes
down
to
that.
but
it
has
certain
other
factors
before
we
get
to
that
point.
you
will
note
that
the
examiner
in
this
case
said
that
the
congress
gave
to
the
power
commission
the
authority
--
the
authority
to
excuse
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
even
in
the
presence
of
those
things
sought
to
be
prevented
by
the
clayton
act.
even
in
the
presence
of
those
things
sought
to
the
prevented
by
the
clayton
act,
which
must
mean
that
even
if
a
violation
have
been
made
note
to
him
with
the
limited
showing
we're
able
to
make
in
that
case,
it
would
have
been
of
no
moment
because
he
was
preceding
under
the
erroneous
notion
that
congress
gave
the
commission
the
power
to
excuse
violations
of
the
antitrust
law.
and
of
course
it
did
not.
the
rca
case,
the
maryland
milk
case
are
squarely
inline
with
what
powers
this
commission
has.
but
he
purported
to
excuse
a
violation
which
might
have
been
his
mind
and
he
didn't
specifically
find
one
yes
or
no,
but
he
suggested
one
at
least.
he
purported
to
excuse
it
upon
the
language
in
the
opinion
which
he
asserted
that
congress
gave
the
power
to
the
commission
when
a
con
--
when
a
transaction
was
duly
consummated
as
section
7
says
to
excuse
a
violation.
he
was
relying
upon
that
section
of
the
clayton
act
which
says
that
transactions
duly
consummated
pursuant
to
authority
given
by
name
of
the
agencies,
one
of
which
is
--
one
of
which
is
fpc
shall
be
exempt,
pursuant
to
such
statute
vesting
such
authority
in
such
agency.
but
that
ignored
the
rca
case.
it
ignored
the
fact
that
congress
never
at
anytime
in
the
natural
gas
act
gave
this
agency
any
power
as
to
antitrust
questions.
the
only
power
it
has
is
under
section
20
where
it
must
report
a
violation
of
such
or
may
report
it
to
the
attorney
general.
it
isn't
equipped
by
nature
or
staff
to
handle
antitrust
questions
and
then
ensured
it
was
never
intended
by
the
congress
that
it
should
pass
it
on
antitrust
questions
as
he
purported
to
pass
upon
them.
the
thrust
of
the
decision
of
the
power
commission
is
that
we
may
pass
upon
and
excuse
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
this
is
more,
this
is
more
than
just
considering
them,
this
is
deciding
them.
now,
aside
from
the
authority,
aside
from
the
authority
which
i
maintain
doesn't
exist,
there
was
another
question
here
and
it
goes
to
your
question
about
abuse
of
discretion.
i
don't
think
there's
any
quarrel
at
all
with
the
proposition
that
this
agency
simply
does
not
have
the
power
to
decide
antitrust
questions
as
such.
and
if
an
antitrust
violation
appears
before
them
in
the
case,
they
have
no
discretion
to
issue
a
certificate.
but
even
assuming
they
did,
let's
talk
about
this
and
not
as
the
law
dictates
the
conduct
to
be
followed
but
as
the
best
way
or
the
sound
way
of
doing
it
within
proper
discretion.
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
files
a
complaint
saying
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
has
been
violated.
we
are
not
to
presume
that
that
complaint
was
likely
filed,
that
it
wasn't
fortified
by
a
wealth
of
investigation
and
material
and
that
there
wasn't
something
to
it.
that's
the
first
thing.
california
asks
the
commission
to
stay
its
proceedings.
we
predicted.
we
didn't
know
how
successful
we
were,
but
we
predicted
that
we
would
one
day
perhaps
be
in
this
court
upon
this
very
question.
we
had
in
mind
the
mingling
of
assets,
the
public
interests,
the
rates
and
charges
that
would
be
imposed
by
a
combination
said
to
be
unlawful
in
which
when
the
trial
in
utah
if
it
does
conclude
and
may
say
that
this
was
unlawful
and
the
rates
and
charges
collected,
what
happens
to
those
in
the
meantime.
i
don't
know
what
the
answers
to
these
things
are.
i
do
know
that
we've
got
a
case
in
which
the
consumer
interest
because
of
the
situation
created
by
not
waiting
are
being
damaged
greatly
if
the
complaint
in
salt
lake
city
be
correct
and
it
may
well
be
proven
to
be
correct.
and
this
was
the
abuse
of
discretion.
the
other
clear
abuse
use
of
discretion
was
in
failing
to
state
proceedings
to
take
the
material
from
utah
and
have
it
before
them
to
have
their
judgment
one
way
or
the
other.
and
not
doing
that,
how
then
were
they
complying
with
the
doctrine
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh
case
to
give
consideration
of
monopoly
or
antitrust
questions.
it
must
mean
meaningful
and
proper
consideration.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
they
did
your
honor.
there
was
a
series
of
letters
exchanged
between
the
power
commission
and
the
department
of
justice
and
each
one
was
apparently
reluctant
to
proceed.
but
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
until
my
motion
was
filed
asking
for
a
stay
on
september
8,
1958.
it
was
not
until
that
motion
was
denied
that
in
october
then,
the
district
court
stayed
its
proceedings.
and
of
course,
the
proceedings
before
the
commission
had
commenced
in
september.
the
motion
was
denied
on
the
15th.
the
proceedings
commenced
the
17th
and
the
district
judge
in
utah
states
his
proceedings
on
october
the
10th
because
the
denial
of
california's
motion
as
i
take
it
was
clear
notice
to
the
district
court,
we
are
proceeding.
and
i
maintain
of
course
that
discretion
must
be
lawfully
exercised
that
it
can
be
abused
and
it
was
abused
here.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
realized
that
your
honor
but
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
there's
a
great
deal
more
to
it
than
that
because
we
are
concerned
here
with
whether
or
not
jurisdiction
has
been
properly
exercise.
now,
let's
approach
this
case
from
the
interest
of
great
pairs
or
consumers
along
the
entire
system
which
is
now
one.
the
power
commission
has
authorized
the
merger.
stock
has
been
exchanged,
debts
cancelled,
contracts
made.
there
have
been
all
manner
of
things
done
since
that
merger,
that
effect
on
january
1st,
1960.
there
was
a
proceeding
in
utah
which
says
that
this
entire
thing
is
unlawful.
the
merger
itself
comes
out
of
the
stock
acquisition.
it
grew
out
of
the
stock
acquisition
in
the
first
instance.
the
stock
acquisition
may
violate
section
7
of
clayton
act.
now
in
the
interim,
let
us
assume
we
can
go
back
to
utah
and
tried
this
case.
in
the
interim,
and
it's
been
two
years
now
while
we're
in
the
limbo
of
non-determination
as
to
lawfulness,
what
about
the
public?
what
is
being
done
which
might
not
be
done
if
the
agency
had
waited
and
the
court
in
utah
had
proceeded
the
judgment,
could
california
for
example
have
another
pipeline
today?
is
there
a
pipeline
serving
california
today
which
is
not
being
fully
utilized
because
of
this
situation?
i
could
ask
all
manner
and
kinds
of
questions
as
to
the
public
harm
which
i
think
exist
today
because
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
proceeded
first.
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
filed
the
complaint.
he
said
this
violates
the
law.
the
federal
power
commissions
said
it
does
not.
and
the
federal
power
commission
thought
it
had
a
section
5,
11
power
such
as
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
to
exempt
these
antitrust
violations
from
the
antitrust
laws.
and
in
reality,
it
does
not.
and
i
might
observe
at
this
point
your
honors
that
there
was
no
compelling
haste
to
rush
into
the
power
commission
and
they
get
a
decision
out
of
it
as
quickly
as
it
did.
if
the
merger
were
that
good,
it
would
still
be
there
after
the
judgment
in
salt
lake
city
had
been
handed
down.
and
if
it
were
determined
to
be
lawful,
it
would
have
been
a
sound
way
of
doing
it.
as
it
is,
whatever
rights
the
public
has
in
this
case
have
been
ignored
now
for
almost
three
years.
and
i
stand
here
before
you
today,
we
are
being
served
by
a
pipeline
corporation
which
still
stands
today
charged
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
with
being
unlawful.and
there's
never
been
any
determination
of
that.
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
and
this
is
suggested
by
the
question
justice
harlan
asked
that
there're
seems
to
be
inherent
in
his
question
the
notion
that
we
are
being
protected
in
some
manner
because
this
was
done
by
a
regulated
commission.
and
the
briefs
of
the
government
and
the
briefs
of
the
el
paso
companies
speak
of
this
complete
blanket
of
regulation
which
is
to
protect
this
in
the
interim.
there
is
a
natural
gas
act
and
there
is
regulation
but
there
is
not
a
complete
and
a
pervasive
scheme
of
regulation.
and
let
me
spell
out
what
i
mean.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
a
public
utility
in
the
normal
sense.
we're
concerned
with
the
pipeline
corporation
which
is
regulated
because
as
the
access,
it's
effective
with
the
public
interest
and
because
it
makes
the
sale
and
the
gas
is
resold
in
interstate
commence.
this
court
in
the
catco
case
had
occasion
to
comment
about
the
inordinate
delay
on
the
part
of
the
commission
in
section
5
proceedings.
and
i
don't
say
that
critically.
there
are
reasons
for
that
delay,
but
i
say
it
factually.
you
said
that
in
the
atlantic
refining
case,
in
1958,
when
you
talked
of
the
section
5
proceedings
which
appeared
interminable
and
reference
was
made
there
to
the
fact
that
the
commission
had
not
yet
gotten
around
to
regulating
producers
and
that
is
a
fact.
that
fact
has
an
impact
upon
other
business
before
the
commission,
rate
cases,
rate
cases
which
have
a
priority
under
section
4
of
the
act
or
not
getting
that
priority.
let
me
relate
the
experience
of
my
--
my
state
under
section
4
of
the
act.
a
docket
known
as
g-4769
which
was
filed
in
october
of
1954
took
five
years
from
the
date
of
that
filing
to
get
a
last
order
or
decision
from
the
commission
on
it.
that
was
five
years.
since
that
time,
we
have
had
three
other
cases
and
we
finally
got
hearings
on
them
commencing
in
the
middle
of
1961.
i
don't
say
it
critically
perhaps
but
i
say
it
factually.
committees
of
the
congress
have
criticized
this
factor
which
exists
at
the
commission.
the
fpc
itself
in
recommendations
to
the
congress
has
asked
for
answers
and
remedies
to
this.
the
power
commission
has
no
complete
authority
or
any
authority
over
the
security
issuances
of
pipeline
corporations.
in
short,
it
does
not
have
that
complete
type
of
regulation
which
is
to
be
advanced
here
today
i
presume
which
would
be
presented
as
a
reason
for
having
this
pipeline
merger
regulated
because
that
would
protect
the
public
interest.
the
answer
to
that
is
it
is
just
not
so.
for
example,
rates,
rates
are
set
not
by
the
commission
upon
its
initiative
but
rates
are
set
by
the
pipeline
companies
upon
their
initiative
by
filings
they
make
or
filings
they
choose
not
to
make.
i
should
like
to,
at
this
point,
take
the
court
through
the
chronology
of
events
here
to
show
the
lack
of
discretion
and
to
show
also
perhaps
the
lack
of
judgments
on
the
part
of
the
applicants
below.
you
will
recall
that
legal
advice
suggested
that
there
was
no
statutory
immunity
so
far
as
this
transaction
is
concerned
and
it
was
not
free
from
doubt.
in
december
1956,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
wrote
a
letter
to
the
applicants
asking
about
possible
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
this
transaction.
on
july
12,
the
meeting
was
held
with
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
concerning
the
antitrust
application
to
this.
on
july
16th,
they
were
advised
by
the
justice
department
that
complaint
would
be
filed.
on
july
22nd,
the
complaint
was
filed.
on
august
7th,
application
was
filed
with
the
commission.
on
september
8,
california
asked
the
proceedings
be
stayed
at
oral
argument.
the
antitrust
question
was
argued
and
the
consequence
is
predicted.
and
the
petition
for
rehearing,
a
stay
was
requested.
now,
what
i
am
saying
is
simply
this,
there
is
a
great
obligation
here,
a
great
obligation
under
the
natural
gas
act
upon
the
part
of
management
in
this
case
to
do
that
which
is
best
and
that
which
is
right.
let
us
look
at
this
for
the
moment
from
the
point
of
view
of
management
as
trustees,
officers,
fiduciaries.
was
it
a
wise
thing
regardless
of
whether
it
was
lawful
or
not
to
take
investor's
money
and
put
it
into
the
state
of
hopeless
confusion,
which
if
the
justice
department
succeeds
in
utah,
will
be
a
condition
which
could
have
been
avoided
and
certainly
should
have
been
avoided?
there's
that
side
of
it.
we're
not
just
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
your
honor,
they
were,
to
my
memory,
neither
invited
nor
excluded.
they
did
not
participate
at
all.
of
course,
the
rca
case
points
out
quite
clearly
that
there
was
no
point
for
them
to
intervene
in
the
rca
case.
there
was
no
obligation
to
intervene
before
the
fcc
because
the
antitrust
enforcement
responsibilities
rested
in
the
courts
in
that
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
correct,
justice
frankfurter.
but
i
assume
that
justice
harlan
meant
that
the
united
states
of
america
intervene
and
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
it
may
be
strange
but
they
do
intervene
in
proceedings
before
the
icc
under
that
act.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
but
that
--
that
is
not
my
family,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
--
that's
the
other
side
of
the
table.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
but
i
was
asked
the
question
and
i
was
giving
it
the
answer
the
best
of
my
ability.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
calculate
my
time
your
honors,
i
have
approximately
45
minutes
remaining
and
i
shall
save
some
to
close.
and
i
would
conclude
my
argument
concerning
the
antitrust
proportion
of
this
case
by
reading
from
judge
prettyman's
opinion.
now,
this
is
what
he
said
and
this
is
what
is
being
reviewed
here
today
and
it
refers
to
the
stock
acquisition
as
compared
to
the
asset
acquisition.
he
says,
“it
seems
to
us
that
the
acquisition
of
all
the
stock
of
a
company
or
as
in
this
case,
99.8%
of
the
stock
with
a
consequent
transfer
of
assets
from
the
acquired
subsidiary
to
the
acquiring
parent
is
an
acquisition
of
assets.
it
is
indeed
one
of
the
most
usual
methods
of
acquiring
assets.”
we
think
the
transaction
here
involved
cannot
be
split
into
two
separate
and
independent
transactions,
one
the
acquisition
of
all
the
stock
and
the
other,
a
transfer
of
the
assets.
if
this
be
correct,
for
the
first
time,
the
federal
power
commission
is
being
given
power
over
securities
and
i'm
not
going
to
argue
the
proposition
to
this
court
that
it
does
not
have
such
power.
if
he'd
be
correct
that
they
have
acquisition
or
authority
over
the
acquisition
of
the
stock,
we
did
not
get
our
hearing,
that
matter
remains
to
be
determined
in
utah.
and
if
he'd
be
correct
that
we
did
not
get
our
hearing
upon
the
acquisition
of
the
stock,
there
was
a
lack
of
due
process
or
less
than
a
complete
record
upon
which
to
make
a
judgment
into
--
in
this
case
as
to
the
lawfulness
of
what
was
done
and
certainly
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion.
the
second
important
factor
in
this
case
pertains
to
rates
and
since
we're
dealing
here
with
the
monopoly
question,
the
question
of
rates
is
crucial,
it's
crucial.
most
monopoly
questions
concerns
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
the
public
is
going
to
have
to
pay
more
than
otherwise
would
because
of
an
unlawful
monopoly.
and
in
this
case,
the
commission
refused
to
permit
cross-examination
upon
the
question
of
rates.
let
me
read
to
you
what
the
examiner's
decision
relates.
he
places
a
title
upon
one
of
the
portions
of
the
opinion
--
his
opinion
this
way,
lower
--
lower
rates
in
prospects,
savings
and
operating
expenses,
reasonable
anticipation
of
lower
rates.
he
says,
“the
unit
cost
of
transportation
of
--
to
all
markets
should
be
less.
he
refers
to
economist,
and
then
he
comments
upon
some
material
placed
into
this
record
by
the
applicants
at
the
request
to
the
stuff
of
the
power
commission.
and
he
describes
it
this
way,
“in
this
material
related
to
future
rate
base
and
rate
of
return,
the
money
they
need
from
the
rate
payers,
gas
expenses,
depreciation
--
depletion
and
depreciation,
taxes
and
other
information.”
this
additional
detailed
information
was
submitted
to
the
staff
by
el
paso.
it
is
at
most
merely
certain
thoughts
or
ideas.
these
were
accounting
calculations
as
to
revenue
deficiencies.
this
expression
of
el
paso's
views,
the
applicant
upon
this
subject
is
certainly
not
relevant
to
any
issue
rightfully
and
logically
related
to
the
basic
issue
of
whether
the
proposed
merger
is
in
the
public
interest.
this
is
true
because
the
merger
herein
authorized
is
to
have
no
effect,
whatever
upon
any
rate
being
paid
by
any
customer
of
either
el
paso
or
pacific.
he
goes
on
to
say,
it
must
not
be
predicted
here
what
the
future
rates
will
be
and
then
he
concludes
despite
that
material
before
him
and
despite
the
contention
of
california
that
the
economic
impact
or
the
cause
to
this
was
crucial
in
determining
whether
it
was
in
the
public
interest
despite
that
he
says,
“therefore,
all
evidence
relating
to
future
rates
to
be
charged
from
the
unified
system
is
irrelevant
to
the
basic
issue
of
whether
the
merger
is
in
the
public
interest.”
and
the
court
on
appeal
adapted
that
as
to
the
commission
of
course
before
that.
what
was
wrong
with
that?
in
short,
everything.
to
begin
with,
the
applicant's
showing
went
into
the
question
of
rates
and
benefits.
so
as
a
matter
of
fairness,
we
should
have
been
permitted
to
cross-examine.
the
examiner
himself
talks
of
lower
rates.
well,
are
these
proceedings
to
be
conducted
in
such
manner
that
we
can
inquire
as
to
lower
rates
but
we
can't
test
to
see
the
possibility
of
higher
rates?
we're
dealing
here
remember,
your
honors
now
as
to
the
public
convenience
and
necessity,
the
public
interest.
the
federal
power
commission
has
been
directed
for
the
congress
as
set
forth
in
this
court
in
the
hope
case
to
protect
the
consumers
against
exploitation.
that's
the
sole
purpose
of
the
act
and
exploitation
takes
the
form
of
dollars
and
cents.
this
agency
itself
consistently
in
cases
and
i've
cited
them
in
the
appendix.
in
section
7
proceedings
has
inquired
into
rates
and
has
authorized
new
projects
upon
a
specific
rate.
from
the
kansas
case
which
is
cited
in
my
brief
up
until
1962,
you
will
find
that
every
section
7
case
of
any
consequence,
and
mind
now,
they're
not
merger
cases
such
as
this
but
they're
acquisition
cases
because
that's
all
it
is.
it's
not
a
merger
and
the
word
isn't
mentioned
in
the
act
required
specific
rates.
in
1939,
the
kansas
case
rejected
the
applicant's
showing
because
of
the
present
inadequate
state
of
the
record
with
regard
to
the
proposed
rates,
proposed
mind
you.
in
1960,
in
the
el
paso
docket
g16
235,
the
rates
proposed
were
considered
and
rates
scheduled
g1
was
an
exhibit
in
the
case.
i'm
not
going
to
go
through
from
1939
to
1960.
they're
in
the
appendix
to
california's
brief
in
this
case
but
they
stand
for
the
proposition
at
the
very
least
that
this
agency
was
under
the
notion
that
consistent
with
its
interpretation
and
duty
under
the
statute,
it
must
inquire
into
specific
rates
as
to
future
things,
and
isn't
it
a
matter
of
common
sense
here.
we're
not
talking
just
about
present
convenience
and
necessity.
we're
talking
about
the
future
public
convenience
and
necessity.
now,
the
second
thing
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
or
the
third
thing
is
that
the
congress
indicated
in
the
legislative
history
in
california's
brief
when
it
amended
section
7
of
the
act
that
it
was
giving
to
this
agency
the
power
to
study
quote
“characteristics
of
the
rate
structure.”
and
so
for
these
reasons,
the
purpose
of
the
act,
the
administrative
meaning
they
put
on
section
7,
what
congress
meant,
this
was
gross
error,
was
failure
due
process
by
way
of
cross-examination
rights,
not
to
go
into
this
subject.
and
in
answer
to
the
government's
contention
that
we
were
permitted
to
do
it,
i
deny
it
but
i
could
even
concede
it
by
saying
as
the
examiner
said
it
was
irrelevant
anyway.
he
paid
no
attention
to
it.
now,
one
of
the
things
then
that
he
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
with
the
ignored
rates
and
the
evidence
pertaining
to
rates
was
--
were
exhibits
420,
421
and
422.
and
this
exhibit
421
or
420
rather
was
prepared
by
mr.
simmons
of
the
staff
of
the
federal
power
commission
and
it
shows
a
revenue
deficiency
of
$60
million
as
a
consequence
of
this
merger.
and
in
terms
of
antitrust
questions
and
harm
or
impact
because
the
position
and
the
posture
of
the
case
today
with
reference
to
utah
and
what
isn't
being
done
there
or
what
was
it
done,
there
has
been
visited
upon
the
el
paso
system
since
these
merger
proceedings,
a
rate
filing
in
the
amount
of
$25,967,000,
that
was
march
1st,
1959.
on
august
24th,
1960
and
increase
filed
and
being
collected
in
the
amount
of
$21,216,100
making
a
total
of
rate
increases
of
$47,283,100
since
the
merger
was
effective,
since
the
stock
acquisition.
now,
i
don't
say
that
this
is
entirely
or
all
attributable
to
the
merger.
but
the
point
of
what
i
am
saying
is
this,
nobody
can
say
that
it
isn't
because
we
weren't
permitted
to
go
into
it
and
it's
no
excuse.
it's
no
excuse
to
say
that
california
didn't
make
a
showing
or
that
you
didn't
make
some
precise
(inaudible)
objection.
the
answer
is
this
commission
has
a
higher
duty
than
that
and
it
can't
be
taken
on
and
off
like
a
pseudo-close
depending
upon
the
chance,
ability
of
an
intervener.
this
commission
has
a
duty
under
the
natural
gas
act
to
protect
consumers
and
that
duty
never
changes
whether
i'm
equipped
to
appear
before
them
as
an
antitrust
lawyer,
as
an
expert
federal
power
commission
lawyer
or
as
a
chief
counsel
of
the
state
of
california
regulatory
commission.
those
things
don't
change.
and
by
failing
to
do
that
in
this
case
under
section
7,
they
did
not
meet
what
congress
intended
when
it
said
to
them
decide
what
suites
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
in
short,
the
customers
of
the
merged
system
were
told
accept
it,
it
is
beneficial
to
you,
whether
or
not
it's
going
to
be
costly
or
efficient
or
good,
we
will
get
to
those
considerations
here
and
after.
in
the
rate
cases,
justice
harlan,
where
it
does
little
good
to
talk
about
it
because
the
door
has
effectively
been
closed.
now,
let
me
state
one
basic
thing
here.
how
or
in
what
manner
could
they
ignore
the
future
impact
upon
rates?
el
paso
acquired
a
company
which
was
never
permitted
to
operate
independently,
a
company
which
by
the
way
sold
gas
at
less
than
cost
of
service
when
el
paso
managed
it,
a
company
which
might
have
had
as
part
of
its
revenues,
$30
million
but
for
the
fact
that
the
decision
to
charge
the
full
cost
of
gas
was
not
made.
el
paso
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
that
company.
el
paso
diluted
its
earnings,
wanted
to
acquire
pacific.
it
issued
$5
million
shares
of
common
to
get
pacific
common.
pacific
had
no
earnings
to
give.
it
imposed
a
requirement
upon
el
paso
to
pay
out
$6
million
more
in
earnings
every
year
and
that
earnings
on
book
went
down
from
approximately
$2.39
to
$1.31
or
$1.50.
i
can't
recall.
this
was
the
impact.
this
was
what
wasn't
going
in
to
and
yet
moody
is
up
in
new
york
could
see
it
right
away.
now,
doesn't
it
seem
reasonable
that
commission
could
have
done
that
and
should
have
done
that?
for
example,
if
the
authorized
in
fair
return
for
el
paso
alone
before
merger
was
6%
and
there's
imposed
upon
them
a
requirement
to
pay
out
$6
million
more
than
previously,
what
happens
to
that
6%
fair
return?
it
is
affected
and
i
don't
care
whether
it
was
affected
downwardly
or
upwardly.
the
point
is
nobody
looked
into
it.
and
of
course,
i
don't
want
to
be
in
the
position
your
honors
of
urging
this
simply
as
a
matter
upon
the
part
of
california
and
california
alone.
all
of
the
assurances
about
the
benefits
of
this
merger
with
reference
to
pacific
northwest
states,
the
rocky
mountain
states
in
california
are
still
nothing
more
than
talk
in
the
realm
of
salesmanship
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
benefits
predicted
for
the
pacific
northwest
are
true
but
on
the
other
hand,
they
may
be
untrue
just
as
with
my
state
because
nobody
as
a
matter
of
the
fact
finding
process
knows.
it
just
wasn't
going
into.
i
shall
turn
now
to
questions
of
due
process
in
this
case
and
i
have
referred
in
the
brief
of
california
to
the
chance
remark,
the
examiner
who
heard
the
merger
case
made
in
a
subsequent
case.
and
i
don't
talk
about
this
now
critically
in
the
sense
of
personal
criticism.
the
court
doesn't
sit
long
enough
to
listen
to
my
shortcomings
but
that
really
isn't
the
point,
is
it?
the
point
is
that
we
all
have
responsibilities
as
public
officials
and
we
meet
them
or
we
don't.
and
the
examiner
in
another
case
said
that
he
didn't
examine
carefully
more
than
15
or
25
of
the
exhibits
in
the
merger
case.
the
first
question
i
would
ask,
“did
he
examine
exhibit
420
showing
the
revenue
deficiency?
did
he
examine
the
exhibit
which
shows
that
pacific
northwest
could
have
and
presumably
should
have
recovered
full
cost
to
service
on
some
gas
it
was
selling?”
he
told
this
previously
that
this
was
irrelevant
anyway.
what
did
he
examine,
what
didn't
he
examine?
i
don't
know.
now,
certainly
if
this
were
the
only
error
in
the
case,
i
wouldn't
be
here.
i
practice
law
too
long
for
that.
but
this
case
is
presenting
an
entire
picture
and
it
isn't
the
first
error
that
makes
a
reversal
and
isn't
the
fourth
and
isn't
the
fifth
but
there
comes
a
time
in
every
case
where
the
accumulation
or
body
of
mistakes
constitutes
grave
error
and
so
it
is
in
this
case
and
of
course,
just
proceeding
from
the
fact
that
this
is
a
federal
agency
of
the
united
states
of
america
dealing
with
the
sovereign
state
and
not
one
person
or
two
persons
in
private
litigation.
the
mistakes
here
again
become
crucial
and
critical.
first
of
all,
what
kind
of
a
standard
is
going
to
obtain
in
these
cases
and
secondly,
in
view
the
interest
of
the
entire
half
of
the
western
united
states
which
are
really
involved
in
this
case
is
this
to
be
permitted
along
with
the
other
errors
in
the
case.
i
say
it
should
not.
you
will
notice
for
example
in
disposing
of
the
antitrust
question
that
there
is
another
error
of
due
process
and
that's
quite
simple
to
relate.
the
commission
found
that
competition
existed
because
the
transwestern
pipeline
had
been
authorized
on
august
10,
1959
which
was
a
fact
and
because
the
pacific
gas
transmission
company
had
filed
an
application
which
was
not
yet
decided,
still
in
the
process
of
hearing
which
was
still
before
the
commission
and
i
suppose
in
some
way,
it
was
known
it
was
going
to
be
approved.
now,
i
don't
say
they
can't
take
official
notice
of
their
own
proceedings
but
that
isn't
the
point
this
time.
the
point
is
could
they
take
official
notice
that
these
other
two
projects
were
of
such
size
as
to
furnish
real
competition
to
el
paso
to
the
merged
corporation
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
they
weren't
equipped
for
it.
that
was
to
be
determined
out
in
utah.
they
didn't
do
it
and
they
couldn't
do
it
but
they
purported
to
do
it.
now,
this
is
somewhat
like
saying
that
if
general
motors
were
the
only
automobile
manufacturing
corporation
in
the
united
states
and
a
proceeding
where
before
a
court
as
to
whether
were
monopoly
that
the
court
could
excuse
it
by
saying
we
take
official
notice
that
the
studebaker
corporation
is
about
to
open
a
plant
in
california.
it
is
just
about
as
ridiculous
as
that
and
it
is
precisely
that
which
was
done
in
this
case
and
that
is
error.
now,
the
other
thing
about
which
i
wish
to
talk
and
it
may
be
a
matter
of
some
delicacy
but
it's
not
for
me
to
waive
the
delicacy
of
the
matter.
it's
my
duty
to
urge
it
and
that
pertains
to
what
i
call
the
lack
of
due
process
and
the
lack
of
fair
hearing
coming
from
the
so-called
ex
parte
contacts
in
the
case.
i
maintain
that
i
have
here
and
not
just
a
suspicion
but
i
have
something
that
we
can
grasp
because
of
the
importance
of
this
cur
--
case
in
terms
of
that
and
that
is
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
time
was
an
issue.
we've
been
through
that.
we
know
time
was
an
issue.
there
were
motions
to
stay.
there
were
arguments
made
to
advance
it
because
of
tax
savings
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
time
was
an
issue
at
oral
argument.
counsel
for
applicants
asked
that
the
case
be
decided
within
a
week
and
i
respond
and
i
said,
“please
gentlemen,
not
a
week,
not
a
week
on
a
matter
so
grave
as
this.”
and
there
it
was
the
way
the
lawyer
should
do
it
out
in
the
open,
we
want
more
time.
now,
unbenounced
to
me,
applicant's
president
had
visited
one
of
the
commissioners
and
had
asked
him
to
expedite
some
of
the
cases.
this
was
brought
out
in
proceedings
before
the
so-called
harris
committee,
a
lobbyist
retained
by
applicants
according
to
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
previous
commissioners,
asked
them
occasionally
to
hurry
along
some
of
the
case.
the
cases
weren't
specified.
i
will
conceive
that.
but
these
requests
occurred
during
the
period
when
the
merger
proceedings
were
before
the
commission.
and
what
was
it?
what
was
it
which
swayed
the
commission
to
decide
this
case
on
december
23rd
after
oral
argument
on
december
10th?
was
it
counsel's
requested
oral
argument?
i
said
don't
do
it.
i
send
a
wire
saying,
“stay
your
--
stay
your
judgment.”
i
previously
filed
the
motion
asking
him
to
stay
the
entire
case.
was
it
the
persuasion
of
counsel
saying
we
want
it
done
within
a
week
which
did
it
or
was
it
something
else?
i
will
--
will
concede
it's
merely
a
suspicion
but
if
you
look
at
the
united
airline's
case,
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals
here,
there
was
what
they
called
marginal
conduct.
and
in
that
case,
the
department
of
justice
in
its
brief
said
that,
“for
the
preservation
of
the
integrity
of
the
administrative
process,
the
matter
should
be
remanded
for
self-investigation.”
now,
that
is
one
event
which
occurred.
let
me
relate
something
else.
and
again,
i'll
be
the
first
to
state,
this
comes
from
suspicion.
on
september
8th,
1958,
i
filed
a
motion
to
stay
the
proceedings.
on
september
11,
1958,
a
man's
employment
is
--
as
a
lobbyist
for
pacific
northwest
visit
a
commissioner.
on
september
15,
1958,
my
motion
was
denied.
at
the
hearings
before
the
congressional
committee,
what
was
said
was
not
remembered.
this
was
not
an
investigation
particularly
to
find
out
the
truth
of
this
matter
or
the
non-truth
of
it
either
way
but
this
is
what
occurred.
this
agency
voluntarily
adopted
the
standard
of
ethics,
which
is
the
same
as
out
of
practitioners
before
the
courts
of
district
of
columbia
ethics.
and
so,
i
would
say
one
way
we
should
measure
this
is
to
imagine
that
type
of
case
in
which
time
is
a
crucial
factor,
a
man's
life,
valuable
property,
whatever
but
time
is
a
factor
and
argument
is
made
as
to
time.
and
then
one
of
the
parties
or
its
representative
asked
the
judge,
please
expedite
some
of
the
cases.
does
he
have
to
tell
that
judge
that
this
is
the
case?
what
was
the
most
important
proceeding
these
applicants
had
before
the
commission
at
this
time?
it
would
not
be
proper
to
do
it
to
a
judge.
if
it
were
known
to
me
in
california,
i
would
move
to
disqualify
a
judge
as
my
right.
this
wasn't
known
to
me
until
after
these
proceedings
were
over.
if
you
read
--
if
you
read
in
the
appendix
to
california's
brief,
the
relations
between
the
members
of
the
commission
and
the
applicant's
representatives,
you
will
see
a
christmas
party,
it's
in
the
appendix.
it's
in
the
reply
brief
of
petitioner
to
briefs
for
the
federal
power
commission
and
el
pa
--
it's
this
blue
brief
your
honor
when
we
were
still
seeking
certiorari.
it
makes
interesting
reading.
i
won't
purport
to
--
to
read
all
of
it
now
your
honors
but
you
will
note
on
page
11
that
one
of
the
commissioners
was
asked
by
the
counsel
for
the
committee
and
then
they
get
into
discussing
the
merits
of
the
case,
commissioner
not
necessarily.
mr.
mack,
while
you're
getting
awfully
close
to
discussing
the
merits
of
the
case,
mr.
stuke,
i
think
so
sometimes.
so
on
page
11
of
this
blue
brief,
it's
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
let
me
refer
you
to
page
9,
same
commissioner.
mr.
so
and
so
comes
in
to
pay
a
special
call
more
or
less.
frequently,
he
may
have
a
new
story
to
tell,
occasionally
the
need
for
expedition
or
the
need
for
handling
of
matters.
now,
this
gentleman
as
the
record
here
shows
is
the
representative
or
lobbyist
for
the
applicant.
and
i
can't
conceive
that
his
duties
would
be
other
than
advancing
the
cause
of
the
applicant
and
that's
what
he
is
doing
here.
i
cannot
accept
--
accept
from
this
court
the
judgment
of
the
government
that
california
wasn't
harmed
because
the
government
simply
doesn't
know.
there's
been
no
investigation
of
this,
and
i
add
what
occurred
here
so
the
other
errors
in
the
case.
and
i
say
that
in
this
case
because
of
the
setting
of
it,
this
is
indeed
crucial.
and
of
course
there's
a
--
there's
a
bigger
and
a
higher
reason
for
my
criticism
than
that
and
that
goes
to
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
the
federal
agency,
which
should
have
the
highest
standards
that
human
beings
could
have
and
that
they
didn't
exist
in
this
case.
now,
the
answer
that's
going
to
be
made
and
always
is
made
and
the
commissioners
themselves
told
this
to
the
congress,
there
are
certain
matters
where
we
need
to
help
of
the
industry.
we
have
to
get
their
point
of
view.
that's
in
the
record
on
litigated
matters
mind
you.
this
court
is
listening
to
this
case
and
it's
a
difficult
case
to
expound
in
one
hour
and
a
half.
but
i'm
sure
you
can
decide
it
and
i
know
you
will
and
yet,
you're
doing
it
only
upon
the
assistance
such
assistance
as
a
lawyer
can
give
through
briefs
and
argument.
the
courts
of
appeal
have
been
placed
by
congress
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
decisions
of
this
agency
and
they
don't
have
the
assistance
of
the
industry
on
matters
like
this.
but
when
you
get
down
to
the
commission,
the
notion
exists
that
there
must
be
a
need
for
this
type
of
thing.
now,
that's
a
false
premise,
it
isn't
true.
if
it's
true
and
if
that's
going
to
be
the
way
the
game
is
played,
it
should
be
set
forth
in
some
manner
known
to
all
so
that
all
rights
can
be
protected
and
of
course,
i
don't
advocate
that
for
a
minute.
now,
your
honors,
i
have
--
as
i
calculate
it
14
minutes
remaining
and
i
will
conclude
and
i
shall
reply
to
the
government,
mr.
dean.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
members
of
the
court,
i
trust
i
have
approximately
15
minutes
remaining
and
i
would
ask
the
indulgences
of
the
court
for
a
bit
more
time
after
in
the
event.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
very
well,
your
honors.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
here's
what
i
would
like
to
state
then.
i
want
to
talk
about
the
record
in
this
case,
the
record
in
this
case.
now,
reference
was
made
to
the
fact
that
the
governors
before
this
project,
it's
not
in
the
record
in
this
case
but
i'll
concede
that
the
governors
were
talked
to.
i
think
el
paso
sent
somebody
around
talk
to
all
the
western
governors
and
they
even
came
to
us.
so
there's
question
about
that.
the
pipeline
corporation
here
told
them
about
this
project,
no
question.
the
ex
parte
secret
letters
of
the
attorney
general,
it
was
mentioned
here.
i
assume
then
that
applicants
join
with
me
in
condemning
that
practice
and
i
think
that
that
if
it's
improper
should
be
a
basis
for
setting
this
back
for
reexamination
on
this
ex
parte
reference
to
which
i
referred.
there
was
no
cross-examination
permitted,
maybe
the
examiner
when
i
attempt
to
do
acquire
about
economic
impact
said
specifically,
“gentlemen,
i
am
going
to
turn
this
into
a
section
4
case
unless
directed
to
do
so
by
the
commission.”
and
that
was
his
ruling.
and
i
accept
it
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
quite
correct
but
you
see
there's
a
great
myth
your
honor
in
proceedings
involving
this
commission
that
consumer
advocates
are
always
trying
to
protect
themselves
by
making
rate
cases
out
of
section
7
cases.
that
seem
trike
and
i
hope
now
discarded
argument
was
discarded
in
the
atlantic
case
in
which
justice
clark
wrote
the
opinion.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
that
case,
they
said,
“we
can't
go
into
the
cross
--
or
the
price
condition
because
it
would
have
to
be
a
rate
condition.”
but
this
court
in
that
case
which
was
a
section
7
case
said
because
of
the
in
terminal
delay,
because
of
the
lack
to
refund
provisions,
you
must
impose
a
price
condition.”
now,
that's
all
we
said
here
in
effect.
not
a
price
condition
but
because
you
were
dealing
with
the
acquisition
of
a
corporation
which
was
losing
money,
we
thought
we
were
entitled
to
know
what
it
was
going
to
cost.
and
the
answer
to
the
question,
it
cannot
be
done
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
commission's
decision
talked
of
lower
rates.
now,
how
could
they
possibly
do
that
without
turning
this
into
a
rate
case
and
yet
somehow
they
did
it?
and
we
were
merely
asking
for
the
opportunity
to
do
the
same
thing,
to
show
that
there
might
be
the
slight
possibility
that
there
might
be
future
in
higher
rates.
that's
all
we
were
asking.
and
were
improper
to
reject
it
furthermore
even
if
the
evidence
came
in
as
they
said
and
if
did
not,
the
examiner
said
and
i
quote
it
what
he
said
to
the
court,
“all
evidence
relating
to
future
rates
is
irrelevant.”
now,
it's
a
great
deal
that
had
been
here
about
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
matter
that
we
don't
have
to
read
section
7.
i
thought
that
was
one
of
the
issues
before
the
court.solicitor
general
in
the
court
below
despite
what
has
been
said
here
today
was
squarely
and
firmly
in
support
of
california.
i
have
the
complaint
here
filed
by
herbert
brownell,
the
then
attorney
general
and
he
was
quite
serious
when
he
filed
this
in
utah
and
the
antitrust
division
joint
to
california
in
the
court
below.
and
i
have
no
power
of
compulsion
over
them.
they
did
it
voluntarily
because
they
believe
their
cause
was
right
and
they
felt
they
had
an
obligation
to
protect
the
consumers
the
west
so
as
far
as
the
monopoly
laws
are
concerned.
and
what
is
being
lost
sight
of
here?
what
is
being
lost
sight
of
here
is
the
fact
that
while
this
house
quarrel
goes
on,
nobody,
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
monopoly
laws
is
taking
care
of
the
public.
nobody
is
taking
care
of
the
public.
and
that's
highly
important.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
that's
the
soul
function
of
government.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
so
far
as
the
antitrust
powers
of
the
commission
our
concerned,
they
simply
don't
exist.
i
assumed
i
think
too
much
when
i
--
when
i
thought
that
court
had
accepted
that
point.
but
they
only
exist
pursuant
to
an
independent
grant
of
statutory
authority
as
this
court
said
in
the
maryland
melt
case
quite
specifically
and
quite
clearly
and
that
--
that
case
applies
the
this
case.
there
is
nothing,
nothing
in
the
natural
gas
act
which
gives
to
the
federal
power
commission
the
authority
to
decide
antitrust
questions.
now,
the
examiner
committed
an
error
of
law
when
he
said
it
was
the
amendment
of
1950
to
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
which
made
its
prohibitions
in
applicable
to
transactions
approved
by
the
federal
power
commission.
that
is
incorrect.
that
is
not
the
law.
he
is
saying
that
he
said
in
his
opinion,
duly
consummated
means
we
give
them
a
certificate,
therefore
it's
duly
consummated.
but
it
must
be
duly
consummated
pursuant
to
another
statue
such
as
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
in
section
5,
11
and
such
as
this
commission
does
not
have.
now
what
was
said
about
the
pacific
northwestern
its
difficulties
is
almost
ludicrous.
what
business,
what
pipeline
corporation
ever
in
the
first
moth
of
operation
began
operating
in
the
black?
this
company
was
never
permitted
to
operate
as
an
independent
company.
it
was
compelled
to
sell
gas
to
the
laws.
ten
directors
of
el
paso
became
ten
directors
of
pacific.
and
that
80%
of
common
of
pacific
went
to
el
paso,
99%
by
may
of
1950.
this
was
not
an
independent
corporation
and
there
was
the
great
incentive
here
on
the
part
of
the
pacific
shareholders
to
take
this
offer
as
i
indeed
have
would
because
of
the
handsome
reward
that
would
come
about
because
of
it.
but
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
organized,
the
purpose
for
which
the
commission
gave
out
a
certificate
was
never
permitted
to
come
true
because
it
was
never
permitted
to
operate
in
the
myth.
the
myth
that
could
not
have
survived
simply
isn't
so.
now,
the
other
fiction
that
nobody
could
have
come
to
california
defies
geography.
all
that's
required
to
build
a
pipeline
to
california
reserves,
they
have
them,
a
contract,
they
could've
gotten
it
from
edison
but
for
the
interference,
and
we
don't
really
know
that
because
we're
not
getting
a
trial
in
utah.
the
market
is
in
california,
the
pipeline
is
available,
the
steel
company
still
manufactures
it.
it
was
as
simple
as
that
in
the
same
way
transwestern
came
to
california.
you
must
not
have
the
notion
here
that
the
congress
intended
any
kind
of
a
monopoly
situation
with
reference
to
pipelines.
it
did
not.
section
7
(g)
of
the
natural
gas
act
be
speaks
that
fact.
the
panhandle
case
and
the
briefs
points
out
that
there's
nothing
in
the
act
which
shows
that
congress
intended
the
monopoly
to
exist
here.
it
simply
did
not.
now,
let
me
say
another
thing.
this
is
not
a
public
utility.
it's
a
public
service
corporation,
quite
different.
if
i'm
operating
a
pipeline
serving
three
people
over
there,
i
can
serve
those
people,
my
market
is
protected,
i'm
meeting
their
needs.
now,
if
three
new
people
come
along,
the
question
then
is,
“who
serves
the
three
new
people?
the
same
pipeline
getting
more
and
more
area
and
more
and
more
people,
or
a
new
pipeline?”
if
the
new
pipeline
comes
in,
the
old
is
protected,
it
has
its
market,
it
has
its
20-year
contract
as
el
paso
has
with
--
with
my
gas
distributing
utilities.
the
new
pipeline
furnishes
no
harmful
competition.
there
can
be
no
duplication
or
waste
of
facilities.
why?
because
the
second
pipeline
has
to
be
authorized
on
a
showing
that
the
public
now
needs
it
despite
what
was
granted
years
before.
now
let
me
say
in
conclusion,
i
think
i
have
five
minutes,
my
thoughts
as
to
what
must
be
done
in
this
case.
it
is
unrealistic,
unrealistic
to
expect
any
degree
of
enthusiasm
or
vigor
in
a
prosecution
by
the
government
in
salt
lake
city
when
the
solicitor
general
is
enthusiastic
in
defense
of
this
decision,
and
the
average
judge
for
some
legal
reasons
and
for
practical
human
reasons
with
which
i
can
sympathize
would
dismiss
this
case.
i
don
think
there's
any
question
about
it,
and
we
can't
play
this
case
both
ways.
the
public
is
entitled
to
protection
and
we
have
to
know
here
and
now
from
this
court
and
not
form
the
solicitor
general
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
future
and
this
should
be
declared
for
what
it
is.
this
was
an
attempt
to
evade
the
antitrust
laws,
deliberately
as
the
record
shows.
it
should
be
characterized
as
such.
the
federal
power
commission
was
not
intended
to
be
used
as
a
harbor
and
a
refuge
for
people
who
were
declared
to
be
violating
the
clayton
act.
and
if
this
court
does
not
reach
that
conclusion,
that
will
be
exactly
the
result
and
they
will
have
gotten
by
with
it.
it
should
be
set
aside
because
of
the
clayton
act
and
it
should
be
set
aside
in
my
judgment
regardless
of
the
clayton
act
whether
we're
in
the
case
or
not
and
i'm
speaking
as
a
regulatory
lawyer
because
there
is
no
public
convenience
and
necessity
in
this
case.
the
staff
of
the
federal
power
commission
opposed
it
for
reasons
of
its
own
and
the
reasons
came
from
the
expertise
of
that
staff,
the
expertise
of
that
staff
where
the
expertise
resides.
you'll
find
in
these
cases
coming
before
you
gentlemen
that
the
opposition
in
these
cases
which
you
reverse
is
usually
from
the
staff
and
when
you
reverse.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
it
lies
largely
there
and
there's
no
expertise
by
the
way
in
this
commission
on
antitrust
phase
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
think
so
far
an
antitrust
law
is
concerned.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
the
commission
was
as
competent
to
decide
it
as
i
with
all
my
limitation
was
to
present
it.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
that's
what
i
understand
your
honors
and
yet
they
do.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i'm
not
asking
you
to
pass
on
the
clayton
act,
i'm
asking
you
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well
i
--
i
misspoke,
what
i
meant
to
say
was
i
want
this
court
to
tell
the
power
commission
that
in
deciding
this
antitrust
question
and
they
did
that.
when
you
read
the
opinion,
you'll
see
they
decided
it,
that
it
acted
in
excessive
authority.
and
if
you're
worried
about
the
scrambling
of
assets,
let
me
state
this,
how
did
it
come
to
pass?
there
were
14
warnings
in
this
record
to
the
management
of
a
company,
don't
do
this
thing
for
our
sakes
and
for
your
own
sakes.
because
any
mistakes
a
public
service
corporation
makes
are
usually
paid
for
in
the
long
run
by
the
people
whom
they
serve
and
so
that
should
be
no
consideration
to
a
clear,
precise
judgment
from
this
court
as
to
how
wrong
this
case
is.
thank
you
your
honors.
