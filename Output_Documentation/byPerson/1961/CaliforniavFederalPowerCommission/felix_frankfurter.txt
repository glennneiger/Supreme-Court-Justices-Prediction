justice

frankfurter
but
they're
not
an
independent
legal
entity
with
the
right
to
intervene
the
antitrust
division?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
is
here.
the
antitrust
division
is
under
that
general
umbrella
of
the
department
of
justice.
this
notion
that
separate
divisions
of
the
department
can
come
in
and
litigate
on
their
behalf,
it
--
it's
a
strange
notion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
maybe
they
do
but
they
have
an
understanding
here
as
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
suggesting,
mr.
bennett.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
department
appeared
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
would
lead
you
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
question
of
construction
of
the
section
7,
if
there'd
be
diversions
of
view
between
the
department
of
justice
and
federal
power
commission,
the
federal
power
commission
would
have
an
independent
position
to
present
its
view
even
against
the
contrary
view
of
the
department,
i
gather.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
--
maybe
i
wrong
i
supposed
that
the
federal
power
commission
hasn't
got
the
--
hasn't
the
status
of
the
itc
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
here,
we
have
frequently
as
a
party
--
as
a
party
litigant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
the
antitrust
division
couldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
appears
--
i
suspect
when
it
appeared
as
an
independent
litigant
to
the
party
litigant,
in
order
to
file
a
brief
to
solicitor
general
has
to
get
the
sense,
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
take
you
one
minute
out
of
your
order?
to
face
the
practical
problem,
if
the
commission
and
the
court,
the
particular
district
court
laid
out
a
gas
law,
you
go
ahead
and
you
go
ahead
then
the
only
way
to
resolve,
where
there'll
be
--
the
only
way
to
resolve
that
(inaudible)
would
be
some
kind
of
a
mandamus
proceeding
by
this
court
and
make
the
district
court
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
possibly
the
power
commission
to
say
we've
got
--
we
don't
want
to
have
a
swollen
docket,
would
you
make
the
district
court
room
so
we
can
go
ahead,
power
for
those.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
question
is
not
whether
they
didn't
happen
but
what
was
required
that
they
do
happen.
i
mean,
that
the
commission
should
all
the
time
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
mr.
dean,
it
seems
so
strange
although
--
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
attorney
general
or
some
appropriate
official
of
the
department
of
justice
wrote
to
the
federal
power
commission
to
proceed
precisely
in
a
way
in
which
they
have
proceeded
(inaudible)
for
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
where
the
expertise
lies
largely.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that's
what
a
court
is
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
this
court.
de
novo
ab
initio,
you're
asking
us
to
pass
on
the
clayton
act
and
means
our
district
court,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
just
what
you
did
two
minute
--
a
minute
ago?
