justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
urged
here
in
some.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
--
you
urged
that
we
have
told
the
--
for
the
commission
to
go
ahead,
should
we
pass
on,
in
effect,
with
their
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
colorado?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
start
in
new
mexico.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
is
that
in
new
mexico
and
the
basis
there,
i
thought
it
should
that
solicitor
general
(inaudible)
as
i
understood
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
starting
point
as
i
saw
it,
goes
to
the
el
paso
line,
it
was
much
closer
to
california
that
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
in
nevada
but
cost
of
california.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
this
plan
but
as
opposed
to
that,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
was
all
designed
(inaudible)
by
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
adjustment
that
does
supply
gas
to
southern
california
edison.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
i
didn't
quite
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did
follow
up
on
that,
didn't
you?
you
disagree
with
the
attorney
general
as
to
finality
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
to
my
mind
as
solicitor
attorney
suggested,
if
it
would
be
true
that
the
attorney
general,
that
the
companies
were
to
go
before
the
commission
under
the
law
which
authorize
them
to
do
so,
must
be
tried
there
practically
for
violating
an
antitrust
law
and
then
be
tried
at
second
time
for
violating
an
antitrust
law
seems
to
me
that
it
creates
a
very
peculiar
situation.
and
it
also
it
seems
to
me
if
that
is
not
the
case
and
if
the
solicitor
general
is
right,
it
come
very
near
being
an
abuse
of
discretion,
while
two
cases
are
pending
before
two
bodies,
one
which
can
render
final
judgment,
one
of
which
cannot,
not
the
order
that
is
sent
to
the
one
who
can
dispose
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
my
trouble
on
his
suggestion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that's
a
commission's
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
the
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
it
is
secret,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
say
it's
consolidated
--
we're
not
marked
confidential,
anything
like
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
did
the
case
stand
before
these
secret
letters
were
written?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
--
did
i
misapprehend
or
mishear
what
the
solicitor
general
said
that
the
government
urged
before
judge
ritter
that
he
go
ahead
with
proceedings
there?
