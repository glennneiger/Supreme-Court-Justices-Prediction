what
will
you
do
with
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
the
national
broadcasting
case
or
i
don't
have
it
in
front
but
as
i
remember,
we
said
that
a
non-convicted,
an
unconvicted
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
would
be
a
basis
for
denial
of
a
certificate
by
the
administrative
of
agency.

violation
where
there
had
not
been
a
conviction
before
the

was

sure
that
there
had
been,
that
they
would

what
you're
saying
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
hardly,
expected
defendant
in
an
antitrust
suit
to
apply
for
mandamus
to
get
his
case
tried.
justice
william
o.
douglas
unless
they
have
a
very
core
opinion
of
the
antirust
suit
to
say
that
it's
alright
to
go
ahead
and
scramble
up
all
these
aims.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
there's
a
clear
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
i
would
think
that
the
better
course
to
be
not
the
scramble
at
all.
