mr.
arthur
h.
dean
if
the
court
please.
i
think
what's
presented
to
the
court
here
is
essentially
a
question
of
what
is
the
entered
relationship
of
the
very
broad
policy
adopted
by
the
congress
with
respect
for
a
wasting
asset,
natural
gas
which
it
turned
over
to
the
federal
power
commission,
that
are
very
broad
in
all
pervasive
scheme
of
regulations
where
they
have
the
right
to
pass
on
all
rates
and
where
no
one
can
engage
in
the
transportation
of
natural
gas
without
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
from
the
federal
power
commission,
which
it
has
found
to
be
in
the
public
interest.
you
are
not
permitted
to
sell
any
of
your
properties
or
to
acquire
any
of
your
properties
or
they're
not
committed
to
build
any
properties
without
their
specific
permission.
now,
el
paso,
which
the
solicitor
general
has
very
correctly
described,
originally
started
in
the
western
part
of
texas
and
went
up
to
the
southwest
part
of
united
states
to
the
southern
border
of
california.
el
paso
itself
has
always
followed
the
policy
of
selling
the
gas
at
the
border
of
the
state
to
an
intrastate
pipeline
company.
it
sells
its
gas
there
to
intrastate
company
which
in
turn,
supplies
the
southern
california
edison
company,
the
largest
distributing
company
in
lower
california
and
the
pacific
gas
and
electric,
the
largest
distributing
company
in
central
and
northern
california.
el
paso
itself
is
primarily
and
almost
entirely
an
interstate
pipeline
company.
it
has
some
producing
gas
wells,
but
they're
almost
entirely
incidental
to
the
gas
that
it
carries
in
its
pipeline.
in
the
mid
30's,
shortly
after
el
paso
got
started,
natural
gas
was
bold
into
the
atmosphere.
you
can
travel
from
the
state
of
kansas
to
texas,
and
is
tremendous
low
sulfurous
cloud
overhung.
the
entire
atmosphere
and
this
natural
asset
was
being
completely
wasted.
el
paso
was
the
first
and
probably
the
primary
interstate
carrier
that
decided
to
put
this
residue
gas
to
use,
carrying
it
to
market.
now,
the
big
problem
of
a
company
such
as
el
paso,
primarily
purchasing
residue
gas,
is
the
fact
that
the
state
commissions
particularly
the
texas
railroad
commission,
under
their
laws
decreased
that
wells
in
that
state
can
only
have
a
certain
number
of
days
of
allowance.
so
although
you
have
to
supply
gas
for
30
days
or
31
days
in
a
month,
you
have
to
have
enough
dry
gas
to
supplement
this
residue
gas
on
the
days
when
the
oil
companies
are
not
operating.
so
therefore
example
the
railroad
commission
should
cut
back
the
number
of
days
of
allowables
from
ten
to
six,
you
would
automatically
have
to
get
millions
of
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
from
your
dry
gas
in
order
to
supply
your
market.
now,
the
federal
power
commission's
records
and
almost
everyone,
tell
el
paso,
you
don't
have
enough
gas
reserves.
you
only
got
gas
reserves
sufficient
for
three
years.
you
must
get
more
gas
reserves.
california
was
not
only
growing
in
population,
a
large
part
of
the
major
defense
plants
were
located
there.
they
grew
very
rapidly
during
the
war
in
el
paso
as
a
public
service
company
and
it's
been
complemented
by
every
one
of
the
states,
including
the
governors
of
all
of
the
states
for
the
job
that
it
is
done
in
bringing
this
gas
to
market.
it
tried
its
best
to
get
additional
reserves
in
this
basis,
and
it
was
unable
to
get
enough
either
to
satisfy
the
market
or
to
satisfy
the
federal
power
commission.
and
also,
is
having
difficulty
in
selling
its
securities
because
you
had
to
amortize
its
bonds
at
about
15
years
because
of
this
lack
of
dry
gas.
pacific
northwest
as
the
solicitor
general
has
described,
was
never
designed.
it
was
never
certificated
and
it
was
never
laid
out
from
an
engineering
standpoint
to
serve
the
california
market.
it
went
from
california
--
it
went
from
colorado
up
through
utah
and
idaho
to
the
pacific
northwest.
it
was
a
very
bold,
and
a
very
ingenious
undertaking
to
sell
this
pipeline
across
the
rocky
mountains
and
to
bring
gas
to
the
northwest
which
had
previously
been
without
a
fuel
that
was
solid
and
substantial.
but
about
the
time
that
it
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
it
starts
in
colorado,
goes
up
through
utah
and
idaho
and
then
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
it
start
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
sir,
your
honor,
it
does
start
in
new
mexico.
but
it's
primarily,
if
you
look
at
the
--
look
at
the
line
that
goes
up
--
the
red
lines
that
starts
up
at
washington.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
it
goes
down
--
it
goes
east,
then
comes
down
oregon
or
idaho,
then
crosses
a
small
park
into
the
southwestern
part
of
wyoming
and
comes
down
into
colorado
in
the
northern
part
of
new
mexico.
san
juan
basin
is
just
below
the
southern
part
of
the
colo
--
of
the
colorado
there.
but
it
was
never
designed
as
you
can
see,
it
starts
off
in
a
roughly
north
--
northerly
direction
and
then
goes
when
it
gets
into
idaho,
into
northwesterly
direction
up
to
the
middle
of
oregon,
then
up
to
the
state
of
oregon
to
connect
up
with
the
gas
reserves
at
canada.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
there
is
no
pipeline
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
there
is
no
pipeline
from
the
pacific
northwest
either
to
nevada
or
california.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well
there
--
the
original
cost
of
pacific
northwest,
mr.
justice
black
was
about
a
160
million
and
it
--
there's
never
in
any
of
the
perspectives
or
any
of
the
certificates
or
any
of
the
engineering
reports,
they
never
was
designed
to
sell
any
gas
in
california.
it
was
designed
almost
entirely
to
bring
gas
into
the
pacific
northwest.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well,
it
had
no
pipeline
in
there.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
sir.
that
couldn't
--
it
didn't
have
any
certificate
from
the
federal
power
commission
to
supply
the
california
market,
and
there
was
never
any
statement
of
intent
to
do
it.
what
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
as
referred,
well
--
mr.
bennett
refers
to
it.
because
of
the
--
of
what's
called
an
inferior
use,
that
is
the
burning
of
natural
gas
under
borders
for
the
purpose
of
generating
electricity,
which
was
sell
at
california
edison
wanted
for
and
pacific
gas
and
electric
wanted
for
is
inferior
to
supplying
natural
gas
for
house
heating,
so
that
on
very
cold
days,
the
public
utilities
used
might
be
interrupted.
so
that
was
southern
california
edison
and
the
pg
&
e
were
interested
in
building
their
own
lines
in
order
to
get
non-interruptible
gas.
there
never
was
at
anytime,
any
possibility
even
remotest
possibility
of
pacific
northwest
selling
any
natural
gas
in
the
state
of
california,
not
at
any
time.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
no
sir,
let
me
--
let
me
clear
--
let
me
clear
that.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
through
the
intrastate
company
supplies
natural
gas
to
southern
california
edison
company.
in
order
to
get
non-interruptible
gas,
the
southern
california
edison
company
has
now
entered
into
a
contract
with
transwestern
company,
a
new
company
that's
been
organized
since
this
case
started
by
large
oil
companies
to
bring
gas
in
the
southern
california
edison,
from
the
san
juan
basin.
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
company,
starting
in
'55,
purchased
vast
reservoirs
of
natural
gas
in
canada,
and
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
has
built
its
own
line
to
supply
itself
exclusively,
a
line
that
comes
down
from
canada
to
oregon,
state
of
washington
to
san
francisco.
the
friendly
el
paso
was
faced
with
this
problem
of
only
three-year
reserves
that
the
constant
admonition
from
the
power
commission
to
get
more
of
reserves
and
these
were
all
marketed
in
california
and
it
saw
that
when
the
pacific
--
'56
because
it
was
--
had
the
boldness
in
the
united
nation
to
throw
this
line
across
the
rocky
mountains.
but
there
were
no
cities
there,
no
industries
there,
and
it
was
also
somewhat
of
a
business
recession,
in
that
part
of
the
country
in
'56.
so
pacific
rendered
a
great
difficulties
in
getting
costumers
onto
its
line.
and
in
the
year
'56,
it
lost
several
millions
of
dollars,
and
was
not
earning
the
dividends
on
its
preferred
stock.
it
didn't
looked,
as
though
at
that
time
--
as
though
canada
was
going
to
allow
some
of
the
gas
to
come
out
of
canada,
and
the
commission
itself
had
been
turning
down
applications
to
bring
gas
out
of
canada
into
the
united
states
for
fear
that
a
foreign
power
even
though
friendly
might
possibly
shut
it
off
in
time
of
war.
so
pacific
was
in
difficulty.
el
paso
believed
that
it
should
submit
this
matter
to
the
federal
power
commission.
it
offered
to
buy
the
assets
of
pacific
but
it
wanted
to
submit
the
matter
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
that's
what
the
condition
of
its
offer.
it
made
that
offer
a
half
a
dozen
times.
mr.
foshee,
who
was
the
president
and
the
promoter
of
pacific
northwest
said
one,
“we're
having
trouble
with
our
credits.
we're
having
trouble
with
our
costumers.
we're
having
trouble
getting
employees.”
this
application
for
the
purchase
of
feasible
facilities
may
take
several
years.
during
that
time,
i
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
to
pacific.
i
don't
know
whether
we
can
lay
on
these
costumers,
or
i
don't
what
is
going
to
happen.
and
for
the
fist
time,
since
the
natural
gas
industries
started,
in
the
early
30's,
the
price
of
oil
lay
down
on
the
west
coast
were
somewhat
cheaper
on
the
basis
of
terms
than
with
natural
gas.
so
pacific
northwest
was
in
real
difficulties,
sellable
perhaps
but
in
real
difficulties.
so
after
many
negotiations,
el
paso
made
an
exchange
of
stock.
the
employees
and
some
of
the
people
connected
with
pacific
felt
that
it
was
advisable
to
keep
it
going
as
an
independent
corporation
and
that
was
the
intent
at
the
time
that
the
exchange
was
made.
it
became
very
clear,
however,
that
because
of
the
financial
difficulties,
the
pacific
northwest
was
in,
it
couldn't
pay
its
preferred
stock
dividends,
that
had
to
sell
some
assets
through
el
paso
in
order
to
pay
them.
it
was
running
into
difficulties
laying
on
this
contract.
it
was
running
into
operational
difficulties
because
you
have
to
decide
each
time
whether
it
should
el
paso
who
filed
the
certificate
with
the
power
commission
or
pacific.
people
wanted
to
transfer
from
pacific
through
other
companies
because
of
the
financial
difficulties,
and
so
it
was
decided
that
it
was
invested
just
to
the
communities
and
this
was
discussed
with
the
governors
and
the
utility
commissions
to
merge.
now,
prior
the
time
that
we
bought
the
stock,
we
laid
the
whole
matter
before
the
attorney
general,
and
we
submitted
a
tremendous
amount
of
information
to
him.
and
the
attorney
general
at
that
time,
without
in
any
sense
of
committing
himself,
i
wanted
to
be
very
clear
on
that,
indicated
that
he
felt
that
where
were
these
matters
were
passed
upon
by
the
regulatory
agencies
that
he
probably
thought
that
was
the
best
way
to
handle
it.
after
discussing
the
whole
matter,
we
therefore
decided
to
file
an
application
with
the
federal
power
commission.
we
didn't
know
until
it
takes
about
four
months
to
file
one
of
these
applications
with
the
federal
power
commission
that
have
some
rules
that
you
have
to
reference
every
application
that
you
ever
filed
with
them
and
it's
practically
fills
a
track
to
prepare
one
of
these
applications,
and
it
takes
really
many
months
and
weeks
to
get
it
drawn.
there
isn't
any
question
that
the
--
that
the
probable
decision
of
the
attorney
general
to
file
a
section
7
suit,
in
the
words
of
mr.
kaiser
the
president
stimulated
the
filing
of
the
proceedings
before
the
federal
power
commission.
but
i
think
that
would
have
been
inevitable
because
we
were
finding
there
was
almost
impossible
to
operate
these
two
companies
because
of
the
financial
difficulties
in
the
operating
property.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
congress
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
natural
gas
act
is
most
clear
on
this
subject
when
chairman
lee
of
california
held
the
hearings
on
the
amendments
to
section
7
and
42,
and
senator
wheeler
explained
it
in
the
senate.
he
said,
“the
problem
is
very
clear
as
to
whether
we
should
trust
the
federal
power
commission
to
say
that
there
should
be
one
company
instead
of
two.
and
if
you
passed
this
legislation,
you
are
giving
to
the
federal
power
commission
the
power
to
decide
that
there
should
be
a
monopoly
but
a
regulated
monopoly.”
questions
were
asked,
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
the
senate
as
to
whether
this
meant
that
the
federal
power
commission
would
have
the
right
to
authorize
the
mergers
so
that
in
fact
there
would
only
one
company,
and
the
answer
to
those
questions
was
clear,
yes.
that
is
the
result
of
this
bill
so
that
the
federal
power
commission
it
seems
to
me
was
entrusted
by
the
congress
with
a
very
clear
authority
and
indeed
a
mandate
to
certificate
lines
only
of
the
public
interest,
for
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
as
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
consumer,
and
also
not
to
certificate
lines
unless
there
was
apparent
justification
for
their
ability
to
be
solved.
so
when
the
congress
said
in
the
clayton
act
that
nothing
in
this
act
shall
apply
to
anything
that's
consummated,
to
show
it
--
that
pertaining
to
the
natural
gas
act,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
meant
precisely
that.
now
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
i
disagree
with
him
as
to
his
finality,
although
i
think
the
court
can
either
do
one
of
two
things.
i
think
the
court
can
either
rule,
your
honor
that
congress
did
intend
as
i
believe
they
did
that
the
federal
power
commission
in
the
public
interest,
had
the
full
power
to
decide
that
there
should
be
one
instead
of
two.
and
that
if
they
decided
that,
i
believe
that
is
controlling
upon
the
courts.
i
think
the
congress
did
not
think
that
the
district
court
in
an
ordinary
antitrust
case
section
7,
which
could
only
take
into
consideration
evidence
as
to
whether
there's
a
lessening
of
competition
or
tendency
to
monopoly
could
not
take
in
this
whole
question
of
a
wasting
natural
asset
or
the
benefit
communities
or
what
was
the
best
in
the
interest
of
the
various
states,
which
the
federal
power
commission
put.
i
therefore
think
that
--
that
if
this
matter
were
handed
back
to
the
district
court
today,
i
don't
see
how,
since
nobody
can
operate
a
natural
gas
company
without
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
from
the
federal
power
commission.
i
don't
see
how
a
district
court
can
order
to
the
federal
power
commission
to
grant
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
binding
upon
the
court
--
upon
the
district
court.
however,
i
believe
that
this
court
has
two
choices.
you
can
disagree
with
me
on
that.
i
think
you
can
say
that
you
affirm
the
order
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
written
by
judge
prettyman,
and
thereby
the
order
of
the
power
of
the
commission
permitting
the
merger
and
you
can
say
however,
if
you
so
wish,
that
you
can
allow
the
department
of
justice
to
continue
the
suit
in
the
district
court
as
to
there
was
a
violation
of
section
7
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
for
the
stock.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well,
let
me
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
i
share
your
trouble,
mr.
justice
black
but
let
me
point
out
to
you
that
on
the
record,
when
we
went
before
chief
justice
ritter
in
march
of
'58,
when
we
urged
him
to
apply
the
document
of
primary
jurisdiction.
department
of
justice
told
justice
ritter
that
they
could
try
that
case
within
a
week,
that
they
were
ready
to
--
ready
to
try
it.
so
took
our
witnesses
out
there,
ready
to
try
it
and
then
the
department
of
justice
was
not
ready
to
try
it.
we
--
we
tried
it
all
during
the
spring
of
'58
to
get
this
case
brought
on
for
trial.
why?
because
we're
public
service
company
and
we
had
to
service
and
get
contracts
and
gas.
we
had
to
finance.
the
department
of
justice
wouldn't
bring
on
the
case
for
trial.
we
went
to
commend
this
length,
answer
most
extraordinary
interrogatories
that
those
end
by
may
and
asked
the
department
of
justice
to
bring
on
the
case
for
trial
and
then
a
most
curious
thing
happened.
i
think
it's
one
of
the
most
curious
things
i've
ever
known.
but
the
attorney
general
in
charge
in
antitrust
wrote
secret
letters,
no
copies
to
us,
although
the
attorney
general
had
testified
that
even
united
states
government
shouldn't
ask
an
administrative
agency
to
do
something
ex
parte.
they
wrote
letters
to
the
federal
power
commission,
secret
letters,
asking
them
not
to
set
the
case
down
for
trial.
we
don't
know
anything
about
these
letters.
there's
a
provision
in
the
power
commission
that
correspondents
in
respect
to
a
cases
available
to
the
parties.
we
asked
for
these
correspondents
and
the
department
of
justice
objected
it.
then
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
sir.
they
--
they
wrote
to
the
federal
power
commission
urging
that
the
federal
power
commission
should
not
set
down
the
case
for
trial
under
the
natural
gas
act
urging
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
what?
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
before
the
commission,
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
no
notice
to
us.
they
were
writing
these
letters
to
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
when
we
asked
for
--
when
we
asked
the
federal
power
commission
for
commission
to
examine
the
correspondents,
the
department
of
justice
objected
in
letting
us
see
these
letters.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
no
--
no
he
asked
--
he
asked
the
federal
power
commission,
please
not
the
set
down
our
application
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act
to
acquire
the
physical
facilities”
in
order
that
they
might
go
forward
with
the
case
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
--
in
court.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
they
were
not
moving
the
case
and
they
refused
to
cooperate
with
us
or
with
judge
ritter
in
bringing
the
case
on
for
trial.
so
where
--
here,
we
were
a
public
service
company
trying
to
operate
under
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
faced
with
the
refusal
of
the
department
of
justice
to
bring
the
case
on
for
trial
and
with
secret
letters
from
the
department
of
justice
asking
the
power
commission
not
to
set
the
thing
down
for
a
hearing.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
it
was
filed
in
july
'57.
we
had
the
first
hearing
before
him
in
march
'58
then
we
had
further
hearings
before
him
in
may
'58
then
when
they
wrote
these
letters
and
the
department
of
justice
in
september
of
'58
filed
an
application
in
judge
ritter's
court
seeking
to
enjoin
us
from
participating,
either
counsel
or
officers
of
el
paso
from
participating
of
representing,
appearing
physically
before
the
federal
power
commission.
we
then
went
before
judge
ritter's
and
i
asked
that
the
department
produce
these
secret
letters
in
which
we
had
learned
and
asked
for
continuance
of
this
case.
the
department
asks
that
we'll
be
joined.
i'm
going
forward
to
this
hearing
then
they
withdrew
that
letter.
that
when
we
argued
before
judge
ritter,
the
department
still
was
not
ready
to
try
the
case
and
so
at
that
time,
judge
ritter
entered
his
order
which
is
still
in
effect
continuing
the
section
7
case
under
the
clayton
act
before
him
until
such
time
as
there
was
a
final
disposition
of
this
case
before
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
they
urged
that
he
go
ahead
with
the
trail
of
the
case
but
they
weren't
ready
to
try
it.
i
think
that
mr.
bennett
is
mistaken
when
he
says
he
was
precluded
from
cross
examination.
he
never
--
he
never
made
an
offer
to
introduce
any
evidence.
he
produced
no
witnesses
and
there
isn't
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record.
he
never
made
a
motion
before
the
trial
examinery
--
examiner
saying,
“i
would
to
ask
this
question.”
there
was
no
denial
of
it.
he
went
on
and
he
asked
all
about
competition.
he
went
on
for
--
for
another
20
minutes
asking
questions.
there
was
no
ruling
by
the
trial
examiner,
denying
any
question
that
mr.
bennett
asked.
there
is
no
question
that
he
asked
to
(inaudible).
there's
no
ruling
on
the
matter
at
all.
he
says
that
the
power
commission
took
judicial
notice
of
these
other
two
applications
but
it
was
he,
mr.
bennett
who
asked
questions
about
this
pipeline
of
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
and
this
pipeline
of
the
transwestern
company.
other
counsel
asked
to
questions
about
still
a
third
line.
there's
known
colloquially
as
the
“hot
tamales”
line.
that's
the
line
that
would
take
gas
out
of
the
state
of
texas,
build
your
pipeline
in
mexico
because
of
very
low
labor
cost
and
bring
it
back
into
the
state
of
california.
so
that
there
are
two
new
pipelines
operating
into
the
state
of
california
while
this
case
is
pending
with
an
application
for
a
third.
all
of
this
was
going
into
on
examination
of
witnesses
before
the
examiner.
there
were
23
days
of
trial.
there
were
six
months
of
briefing.
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
trial
examiner's
opinion
is
a
model
of
--
of
judicial
reasoning.
he
went
into
this
whole
question
of
competition.
he
examines
all
of
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
public
interest.
and
i
submit
that
--
that
his
opinion
was
properly
passed
upon
by
the
federal
power
commission.
that
was
argued
at
great
length
before
the
power
commission.
and
i
submit
that
their
decision
under
section
7
is
correct
and
that
the
order
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
that
the
order
of
federal
power
commission
should
be
affirmed.
if
i
may
say
one
minute,
there
is
no
support
whatever
in
the
record
with
respect
to
any
off
the
record
statements
or
appeals
to
members
of
the
federal
power
commission.
the
record
is
clear
that
members
of
the
federal
power
commission
completely
denied
those
and
anyone
from
el
paso
spoke
to
him
about
this
case.
in
mr.
bennett's
brief
page
20,
his
brief,
he
makes
a
statement
without
any
record
of
support
that
i
saw
members
of
the
federal
power
commission.
that
is
not
true.
i
never
saw
any
member
of
the
federal
power
commission
and
there
is
no
support
whatsoever
for
that
statement
in
the
record.
thank
you.
