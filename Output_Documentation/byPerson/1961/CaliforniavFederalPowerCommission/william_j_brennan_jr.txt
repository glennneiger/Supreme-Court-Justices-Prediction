justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
may
i
ask,
am
i
right
within
the
court
of
the
appeals,
the
department
of
justice
take
the
position
that
the
order,
the
commission
should
be
vacated
to
await
the
outcome
of
the
antitrust
litigation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you'd
now
change
the
position,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
basically,
that
would
mean
antitrust
versus
commission
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
only
the
department
of
justice
could
have
done
that
in
that
case,
california
had
not
become
a
party.
i
guess
california
had
not
become
a
party.
they
could
no
doubt
have
intervened.

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
mr.
solicitor,
any
--
any
effort
california
might
have
made
to
inter
--
intervene,
might
have
ran
up
against
the
consideration
replaced
and
ask
that
question,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
if,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
you
say
at
the
same
time,
they
were
not
moving
the
case
at
all.
