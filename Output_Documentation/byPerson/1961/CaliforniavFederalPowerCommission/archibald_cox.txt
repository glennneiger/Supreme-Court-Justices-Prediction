mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
difficult
and
rather
complex
issues
in
this
case
as
i
conceive
it
revolve
around
the
relationship
between
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
suit
in
the
district
of
utah
and
the
natural
gas
act
and
its
administration
by
the
federal
power
commission.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
before
addressing
myself
to
the
legal
problems
on
that
point,
i
would
review
the
essential
facts
so
far
as
a
--
bear
upon
it.
and
the
court
if
i'd
helped
--
find
it
helpful
i
think
when
i
do
that
if
you
were
to
turn
to
the
back
of
mr.
dean's
brief,
which
is
the
large
white
brief
which
contains
map
of
pipelines
in
the
western
part
of
the
united
states.
el
paso
natural
gas
company
is
a
company
operating
originally
in
the
southwestern
part
of
the
united
states
and
the
great
bulk
of
its
business
as
mr.
bennett
told
the
court
now
consists
of
taking
gas
to
california.
the
original
line
was
the
most
southern.
it
ran
from
west
texas,
the
permian
basin
which
is
a
large
dark
blotch
just
about
on
the
new
mexico,
texas
line,
west
you
will
note
to
blythe,
california,
the
state
line.
and
at
that
point,
el
paso
delivered
the
gas
to
the
southern
californian
companies
which
were
the
distributors
for
them
--
to
all
retail
consumers
and
as
i
understand
it
to
virtually
all
industrial
consumers.
it's
important
to
bear
it
in
mind
that
most
of
the
gas
from
the
permian
basin,
that
is
this
southern
one,
was
residue
gas
obtained
from
the
operation
of
oil
wells
and
therefore,
it
is
gas
of
the
supply
of
which
is
dependent
and
not
only
upon
regulation
by
the
state
commission
as
the
amount
of
oil
that
can
be
produced
but
also
dependent
upon
the
habits
of
oil
producers.
el
paso
second
line
run
from
the
san
juan
basin
which
is
up
in
the
northwest
corner
of
new
mexico
over
to
tupac,
california,
most
of
the
--
in
fact,
the
gas
in
the
san
juan
basin
as
i
understand
it
is
dry
gas,
that
is
to
say
gas
from
wells
which
produced
only
natural
gas.
and
at
tupac,
el
paso
delivered
the
gas
which
it
transported
to
primarily
pacific
gas
and
electric,
which
then
piped
it
by
the
black
line
you
will
note
up
to
the
northern
california,
the
san
francisco
bay
area.
there
was
also
apparently
a
link
to
the
southern
california
companies
there.
and
in
time,
these
two
systems
were
linked
together.
i'm
talking
about
what
railroad
parlance,
what
i
guess
we
called
the
trunk
lines,
the
two
lines
going
west.
there
was
an
enormous
california
market
and
a
market,
a
demand
in
which
was
constantly
increasing.
and
as
i
shall
explain
later,
one
el
paso's
problems
and
one
of
the
great
concerns
of
the
federal
power
commission,
was
to
assure
gas
supplies
which
would
meet
the
needs
of
the
california
consumers.
during
most
of
the
period
of
which
we
are
speaking,
el
paso
was
the
only
supplier
to
california.
there
has
since
been
certificated
and
i
believe
is
now
an
operation.
a
pipeline
owned
by
transwestern
pipeline
company,
which
is
the
black
line
running
from
the
permian
basin
in
the
south
and
then
the
san
juan
basin
up
paralleling
the
line
of
el
paso.
that
is
now
another
certificated
natural
gas
company.
in
addition,
there
has
been
certificated
and
i
am
told
there
is
an
operation
today,
a
line
running
down
from
canada.
its
begin
--
you'll
see
it's
a
black
line
made
up
of
dots,
up
just
about
on
the
canadian
border,
the
state
line
between
idaho
and
montana,
and
then
it
cuts
down
across
washington
and
oregon,
and
eventually
down
into
the
sacramento
valley,
and
so
the
populous
areas
of
northern
california.
that
line
is
owned
and
operated
by
pacific
gas
transmission
company,
which
is
a
subsidiary
again
of
pacific
gas
and
electric
company,
the
distributing
concern
in
northern
california.
in
coming
to
pacific
northwest
pipeline
company,
i
would
emphasize
first
that
in
dealing
with
this
case,
we're
dealing
not
with
all
in
the
established
operations,
but
for
a
very
large
part
with
plans,
for
example
these
last
two
companies
i
mentioned
have
built
their
pipelines
during
this
litigation
while
we
were
arguing
about
the
el
paso's
monopoly,
two
new
companies
have
come
into
the
field.
mr.
archibald
cox
they,
i'm
sure,
are
good
deals
smaller
than
el
paso.
i
don't
recall
that
the
record
shows
precisely,
but
they're
considerably
small,
all
of
these
companies
are
smaller
than
el
paso.
no
question
about
that.
pacific
northwest
pipeline
company
is
an
enterprise
which
was
not
in
operation
during
most
of
the
period
of
which
we're
speaking.
it
made
it
first
application
to
build
a
pipeline
to
the
--
and
operate
a
pipeline,
the
federal
power
commission
in
june
of
1950.
the
certificate
was
granted
in
june
of
1954,
and
then
it
could
begin
to
build
its
operations
commenced
on
january
1,
1957,
and
1957
was
the
first
year
of
operation.
that
pipeline
was
certificated
to
carry
gas
from
the
san
juan
basin
where
the
dry
gas
was
available
to
the
pacific
northwest,
which
at
that
time
was
the
only
major
part
of
the
country,
which
did
not
have
natural
available.
the
line,
you
will
know,
again,
it's
in
red
on
the
map
runs
from
the
northwest
corner
of
new
mexico,
up
through
the
--
what
was
must
have
been
the
very
difficult
rocky
mountain
territory
cuts
across
the
little
corner
--
southwest
corner
of
wyoming
and
then
up
through
the
snake
river
country
up
to
the
columbia,
follows
the
columbia
down
at
the
dales
and
a
bit
beyond,
and
then
goes
up
to
seattle,
and
eventually
to
the
canadian
border.
there
are
several
things
to
note
about
pacific.
first
--
the
first
dimension
to
with
that
it
was
certificated
to
carry
gas
from
the
san
juan
basin,
a
dry
gas
area
up
to
canada.
it
also
it
runs
very
close
to
and
indeed
touches
at
some
points,
the
rocky
mountain
fields,
which
are
one
of
the
large
--
or
a
number
of
the
large
unexplored
areas
in
the
country
from
the
standpoint
of
natural
gas,
where
it
is
anticipated
that
reserves
might
be
developed,
and
then
it
goes
on
up
to
canada.
it
should
also
be
said,
however,
that
at
this
time,
there
was
a
greatly
increased
interest
in
canadian
gas.
it
was
known
there
was
gas
there
but
exploration
in
development
was
being
pushed
and
reserves
of
canadian
gas
were
becoming
available.
so
that
i
think
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
this
pipeline,
as
the
promoters
looked
upon
it,
could
have
been
a
link
going
in
either
direction.
you
could
carry
a
domestic
gas
up
to
the
northwest
so
they
wouldn't
dependent
upon
a
foreign
country
or
if
the
demand
where
for
more
gas
and
we
could
get
coming
from
canada
into
end
of
this
country
then
it
could
be
used
to
carry
gas
south.
the
second
thing
i
would
emphasize
--
or
let
me
put
little
differently.
i
want
now
to
turn
to
the
relationship
of
between
el
paso
and
pacific
northwest.
first,
so
far
as
markets,
that
is
sales
are
concerned,
there
was
at
no
time
any
actual
competition
between
el
paso
and
pacific.
indeed,
there
was
no
actual
competition
because
there
was
no
pipeline
leading
from
pacific
northwest
pipeline
to
the
california
border,
much
less
any
california
market.
there
were
unquestionably,
some
possible
lines.
there
was
perhaps
one
should
say
potential
competition.
and
mr.
bennett
has
mentioned
the
hope
of
pacific's
chairman,
that
he
might
be
able
to
intro
--
to
interest
some
californian
distributors
in
taking
gas
from
pacific.
the
--
that
would
have
required
--
the
distributor
or
really
user,
with
whom
pacific's
chairman
had
spoken,
was
southern
california
edison,
a
large
industrial
user,
who
had
been
taking
gas
on
an
uninterruptible
basis
from
el
paso,
but
who
was
in
trouble
with
the
local
authorities
because
with
the
smog
problem
in
los
angeles.
and
pacific
had
had
some
talks
with
southern
california
edison,
about
southern
california
edison
taking
gas
which
would
be
canadian
gas
presumably
from
pacific
northwest.
now,
the
president
of
the
pacific
northwest
testified
at
the
hearing
in
this
case.
it
does
talks
--
never
got
at
all
close
to
reality.
he
said
--
well,
i've
misplaced
all
these
papers.
he
said
they
never
came
close
enough
to
worry
about
in
terms
of
financing.
and
there
were
some
practical
reasons
for
that.
you
had
to
build
a
pipeline.
and
the
pipeline
of
course,
would
have
to
be
financed.
southern
california
edison
could
not
--
and
everybody
recognize
this,
use
enough
gas
to
justify
building
a
pipeline
from
the
pacific
northwest
pipeline
company
down
to
california.
what
have
to
be
done
from
the
promoter's
standpoint
was
to
take
this
tentative
agreement,
with
no
price
fixed,
in
which
was
subject
to
cancellation
if
it
didn't
prove
economically
feasible,
take
that
agreement
with
the
southern
california
edison,
and
then
go
to
pg
&
e
or
to
the
southern
california
company,
and
persuade
them
to
take
the
rest
of
the
gas
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
contracts
for
in
order
build
pipeline
and
then
you
would
have
to
finance
it.
well,
this
just
never
came
off
because
pacific
gas
and
electric
didn't
want
to
buy
any
gas
from
pacific
northwest
and
there
was
never
any
suggestion
that
the
southern
california
company
were
willing
to
take
it.
another
difficulty
which
is
spelled
out
in
more
detail
in
our
brief,
is
that
the
price
that
which
pacific
northwest
could
get
gas
to
the
california
border,
as
they
were
estimating,
was
around
40
or
50
cents
unit
of
sales
whereas
el
paso
was
delivering
it
at
around
25
or
30
cents
a
unit
of
sale
so
that
of
that
time,
the
rates,
potential
rates
were
competitively
out
of
the
question.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
pacific
in
summary,
that
pacific
couldn't
ever
hope
to
come
into
this
area.
i
do
mean
to
say
that
there
was
nothing
that
was
anywhere
close
to
actuality
and
as
i
will
show
a
little
later,
they
were
very
considerable
obstacles
to
pacific
ever
building
these
lots
across
nevada
down
to
california.
the
other
aspect
of
the
relations
between
--
relationship
between
pacific
northwest
and
el
paso
that
i
would
emphasize
is
that
in
many
respects,
their
resources
and
facilities
were
complimentary.
together,
there
would
be
a
much
better
chance
of
breaking
the
potential
supplies
of
natural
gas
available
to
the
pipeline
company
as
carrier
in
the
balance
with
its
markets.
el
paso
had
a
vast
sales
potential
in
southern
california.
it
had
a
difficulty
in
getting
short
supplies.
for
example,
even
1953,
the
commission
in
the
report
began
finding,
the
southern
california
companies
will
experience
deficiencies
in
meeting
their
requirements
both
for
peak
day
and
annual
demands
beginning
with
the
year
1954.
and
then
a
little
later
in
the
same
opinion,
the
need
for
additional
gas
in
the
territories
served
by
pg
&
e
results
from
a
decline
in
the
availability
of
natural
gas
produced
to
california
and
then
increase
the
load
growth.
with
additional
gas
to
be
purchased
from
el
paso,
pg
&
e
will
experience
deficiencies
in
meeting
its
requirements.
and
this
was
brought
home
in
later
commission
opinions
not
in
this
case
but
in
other
cases
involving
certification
of
sales
or
other
land
brought
home
to
el
paso.
for
example
in
may
1956,
the
commission
said
of
el
paso,
“the
record
conclusively
demonstrates
that
after
1958,
the
requirements
of
present
customers
will
exceed
el
paso's
ability
to
supply
gas
to
them.”
and
then
i
said
that
in
next
certificate
proceeding,
we
will
require
el
paso
to
present
a
definite
program
demonstrating
how
its
future
system
requirements
are
to
be
met
and
how
ultimate
consumers
will
be
protected.
i
read
these
passages
to
emphasize
that
everyone
knows
that
el
paso
needed
gas.
now,
pacific
was
in
the
reverse
situation.
pacific
had
access
to
this
new
---
to
these
rocky
mountain
areas.
it
had
gas
contracts
in
the
--
primary
in
the
san
juan
basin
and
its
--
during
its
early
operation,
it
was
not
operating
that
peak
load
or
at
capacity
of
the
pipeline
and
indeed,
the
development
of
the
consumer
markets
had
proved
very
disappointing.
in
addition,
in
the
background,
pacific
did
have
access
to
this
canadian
gas
which
el
paso
was
physically
a
long
way
off
road.
there
was
another
respect
in
which
putting
the
two
together
would
make
for
a
unit
which
was
stronger
in
terms
of
its
ability
to
satisfy
the
demand
of
california.
as
i
pointed
out
from
the
beginning
of
my
argument,
el
paso's
supplies
came
chiefly
from
the
permian
basin
and
this
was
this
residue
gas.
this
meant
that
they
have
to
have
some
dry
gas
available
to
back
up
the
residue
gas
so
that
you
would
be
able
to
use
it
when
oil
production
fell
off
therefore
your
supplies
of
residue
gas
fell
off.
and
this
matter
of
the
balance
between
residue
gas
and
dry
gas
in
the
el
paso
system
had
been
a
matter
of
concern
to
el
paso
and
to
the
federal
power
commission.
hooking
up
through
a
corporate
link,
pacific
northwest
supplies
of
dry
gas
would
help
to
meet
their
problem.
there
were
two
other
things
which
in
a
sense
made
these
systems
complimentary.
in
the
first
place,
pacific
had
in
this
very
early
stage
some
very
serious
problems.
the
cost
of
building
the
pipeline
had
exceeded
the
estimated
cost
by
27%.
the
markets
were
not
up
to
expectations.
in
terms
of
building
any
new
pipelines,
they
certainly
didn't
have
the
capital
whether
they
could
raise
it
or
not
remains
speculative,
although
the
president
said
he'd
never
tried
to
finance
anything
that
he
wasn't
able
to
finance
still
he
didn't
have
wherewithal
here
in
terms
of
fixed
contracts
even
go
out
to
begin
trying
to
finance.
and
in
addition,
there
was
one
thing
that
no
doubt
was
quite
attractive
to
both
companies,
pacific
northwest
cutting
$23,000,000
tax
loss
which
could
be
carried
over
only
for
a
limited
time
longer
because
the
five-year
period
was
beginning
to
run
and
this
was
unquestionably
one
of
the
reasons
where
the
urgent
desire
for
haste.
there
were,
as
mr.
bennett
has
told
you,
beginning
in
1955
negotiations
to
merge
the
two
concerns.
they
broke
down
in
1955
on
two
occasions
because
el
paso
and
pacific
northwestern
had
different
ideas
as
to
how
they
should
be
accomplished.
el
paso
wanted
to
acquire
the
assets
and
if
el
paso
did
acquire
the
assets
then
everyone
was
agreed
that
they
would
have
to
go
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
obtain
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
the
acquisition.
such
a
proceeding
could
be
expected
to
take
as
indeed
it
did
eventually
two
or
three
years.
pacific
northwest
deemed
this
very
objectionable.
they
were
at
that
time
engaged
in
trying
to
carry
on
their
initial
finances.
they
were
trying
to
build
an
organization
to
run
this
pipeline
which
was
still
under
construction
and
to
have
said,
“well,
we're
going
to
turn
all
our
assets
over
to
el
paso
maybe
if
the
commission
approves
would
have
made
it
hard
to
acquire
personnel
and
would
have
made
it
harder
they
thought
to
carry
on
the
finances,”
so
that
they
were
unwilling
to
go
the
sale
of
assets
route
and
el
paso
was
unwilling
to
go
the
stock
acquisition
route.
in
1956,
however,
the
negotiations
for
the
merger
were
resumed
and
in
november
of
that
year,
they
were
consummated
by
el
paso's
acquiring
99.8%
of
the
stock
of
pacific
northwest.
i'd
like
to
pause
here
in
the
account
of
events
simply
to
find
out
what
was
the
legal
situation
at
the
time
that
el
paso
had
acquired
almost
all
the
stock
of
northwest
pacific.
on
page
3
of
my
brief,
2
and
3,
we've
set
out
the
critical
provisions
of
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act.
it
provides
--
i
read
the
essential
words
starting
at
the
bottom
of
page
2,
“no
natural
gas
company
shall
engage
in
the
transportation
or
sale
of
natural
gas
or
undertake
the
construction
or
extension
of
any
facilities
therefore
or
acquire
or
operate
any
such
facilities
unless
there
is
enforced
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.”
everyone
assumed
in
november
1956
that
this
purchase
of
nearly
all
pacific
northwestern
stock
by
el
paso
was
not
an
acquisition
of
pacific
northwestern's
pipelines.
that
was
the
everyone's
assumption
at
that
time.
now,
i
emphasize
this
for
two
reasons,
first,
until
the
case
came
to
this
court
or
certainly
until
judge
prettyman
wrote
his
opinion.
that
was
the
assumption
on
the
basis
of
which
the
entire
proceedings
both
here
and
in
utah
went
forward.
judge
prettyman's
opinion
does
seem
to
suggest
that
where
one
company
acquires
99.8%
of
the
stock
of
another
that
that
is
an
acquisition
of
assets.
the
commission
as
mr.
bennett
said
has
within
the
--
within
the
last
12
months
and
i
think
a
good
deal
less
than
that
now,
taken
proceedings
in
which
it
has
paused
for
a
decision
in
the
case
involving
humble
oil
the
question
whether
the
statute
does
apply
under
those
circumstances.
i
take
time
to
emphasize
this
for
two
reasons,
first,
the
entire
litigation
having
been
conducted
on
the
assumption
that
the
acquisition
of
assets
did
not
violate
sections.
the
acquisition
of
stock
did
not
constitute
an
acquisition
of
asset.
i
propose
to
argue
the
case
on
the
basis
of
that
assumption.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
not
been
trashed
out
before
the
commission,
it's
not
been
the
subject
of
argument
in
the
lower
courts
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
inappropriate
here
to
introduce
what's
a
far-reaching
question
of
importance
where
i
don't
think
it's
essential
to
the
disposition
of
this
case.
what
i
do
want
to
emphasize
for
the
court's
attention
precisely
because
it
is
a
live
and
currently
debatable
issue
which
i
should
think
ought
to
be
held
open
for
the
future
in
any
opinion
this
court
quite
delivered.
the
other
reason
i
emphasize
it
is
of
course
that
it
was
on
the
basis
of
this
assumption
that
the
proceedings
under
the
clayton
act
were
intuitive.
the
clayton
act,
section
7
is
set
forth
beginning
on
page
5
of
our
brief.
you'll
recall
that
it
forbids
one
corporation
engaged
in
commerce
to
acquire
directly
or
indirectly
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
stock
of
another
where
the
effect
to
such
acquisition
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
or
to
tend
to
create
a
monopoly.
now
this,
if
the
effect
of
this
acquisition
was
to
tend
to
substantially
lessen
competition,
then
it
would
if
one
stopped
here,
have
been
a
violation
of
the
clayton
act.
however,
there's
another
sentence
to
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
which
is
a
very
important
part
at
least
to
the
background
of
all
these
proceedings.
down
at
the
bottom
of
page
5,
nothing
contained
in
this
section
shall
apply
to
transactions
duly
consummated
pursuant
to
authority
given
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
federal
communications
commission,
federal
power
commission.
the
proviso,
the
meaning
of
the
proviso
is
a
matter
of
dispute.
again,
it's
an
issue
which
i
do
not
believe
has
to
be
resolved
in
this
case
but
it's
so
much
a
part
of
the
background
that
i
think
it
conduces
to
clarity
to
refer
to
it
here.
if
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act
did
not
apply
to
the
stock
acquisition,
then
of
course
this
last
sentence
or
the
proviso
would
have
no
application
to
the
stock
acquisition
and
if
the
required
effect
on
commerce
would
prove,
the
stock
acquisition
would
violate
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
that
was
the
theory
on
which
the
department
of
justice,
and
if
i
fall
into
saying
antitrust
division,
let
me
make
it
clear
that
i
mean
the
department
of
justice.
alright,
that
was
the
theory
on
which
the
department
of
justice
brought
sought
on
july
22,
1957
in
the
district
of
utah
under
the
clayton
act.
almost
immediately
thereafter,
it
was
15
days
roughly,
el
paso
and
pacific
northwest
filed
an
application
with
the
federal
power
commission
seeking
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
el
paso
to
acquire
the
physical
assets
or
all
the
assets
but
specifically
the
pipeline
of
pacific
northwest.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
there
were
three
factors
which
was
testimony
indicated
led
to
that.
one
was
the
complimentary
character
of
the
facilities
which
i
explained
before.
second,
and
there
was
specific
testimony
on
this
was
that
the
officials
of
el
paso
had
discovered
that
in
operating
pacific
northwest
through
a
separate
corporation.
they
were
not
able
to
achieve
all
the
economies
and
facility
of
operation
that
they
had
earlier
anticipated.
and
third,
it
was
testified
that
the
asset
merger
if
i
may
call
it
that,
was
considerably
stimulated
by
the
fact
that
the
government
had
brought
this
antitrust
suit.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
point
in
any
dispute
at
all.
that
certainly
was
one
of
the
things
that
led
to
the
filing
the
application
with
the
commission.
now,
i
would
like
to
run
through
the
ensuing
procedural
steps,
as
quickly
as
i
can,
leading
up
to
what
seems
to
me
to
have
been
the
critical
event.
the
letter
written
by
the
chairman
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
the
judge
in
the
utah
court
about
which
should
go
first
and
the
utah
court's
decision
that
the
commission
should
go
first.
the
first
move
was
a
motion
filed
by
el
paso
to
stay
the
antitrust
suit
until
the
commission
should
have
made
its
decision.
that
motion
curiously
enough
was
supported
by
mr.
bennett.
the
motion
was
denied
and
el
paso
sought
to
bring
the
case
here
directly
by
an
extraordinary
writ
of
certiorari.
in
response
to
the
application
for
that
writ,
in
1957
this
was,
the
solicitor
general
then
took
what
has
been
the
position
of
the
united
states
consistently
throughout
this
litigation.
whatever
the
district
court's
decision
maybe,
this
was
assuming
that
the
antitrust
case
would
go
forward.
whatever
the
district
court's
decision
may
be,
it
cannot
oust
the
commission
of
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
asset
consolidation
proceeding
just
as
a
prior
decision
by
the
commission
could
not
oust
the
district
court
of
its
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
clayton
act
case.
and
that
is
essentially
my
position
here.
the
district
court
case
can
and
unless
something
happens
in
this
case
that
changes
the
situation,
the
department
of
justice
intends
to
prosecute.
we
thank
that
they
--
each
body
had
authorities.
i
shall
argue
in
the
moment.
i'm
just
trying
to
show
now
that
we've
been
consistent
all
the
way
through
that
each
body
had
authority
to
go
ahead
and
deal
with
its
responsibilities
under
two
different
statutes.
the
antitrust
suit
--
the
antitrust
suit
is
still
pending
and
i
will
read
in
just
a
moment
the
final
order
in
the
sense
of
the
last
order
that
has
been
entered
in
that
case.
what
happened
to
the
--
this
court
denied
the
extraordinary
writ
of
certiorari
so
that
the
denial
of
el
paso's
motion
for
a
stay
stood.
the
trial
of
the
antitrust
suit
was
set
for
march
1958,
but
it
was
postponed
at
the
request
of
the
department
of
justice.
during
spring
and
summer
of
that
year,
the
department
of
justice
sent
several
letters
to
the
federal
power
commission
urging
it
to
withhold
any
action
on
the
applications
--
on
the
application
for
approval
of
the
merger
until
the
antitrust
case
had
been
decided.
at
first,
the
chairman
replied
politely
and
said
that
the
commission
would
consider
this,
and
we've
glad
to
have
the
antitrust
--
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice's
views.
but
eventually,
on
july
29,
he
wrote
back
saying
that
in
view
of
the
evidence
before
its
staff,
the
representations
by
a
number
of
state
public
utilities
commissions
and
the
pending
condition
of
pacific,
that
the
commission
had
decided
that
its
hearing
should
go
ahead.
and
in
that
letter,
mr.
justice
harlan,
chairman
crookendall
invited
the
department
of
justice
to
participate
in
the
proceeding.
the
department
of
justice
chose
not
to
participate
in
the
federal
power
commission
proceeding
and
it
has
never
been
an
inform
--
never
been
a
formal
party
to
them
in
any
sense
at
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
honestly
don't
recall
but
i
think
certainly
not
an
aluminum
case
or
a
brand
of
shoe
case.
it
--
it
was
originally
thought
it
could
be
gotten
out
of
the
way
quite
quickly.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
i
presume
it
would
have
been
some
months.
the
commission
scheduled
its
hearings
and
its
hearings
began
on
september
17,
1958.
the
hearings
went
on
for
roughly
ten
days.
the
applicants
put
their
case
in
and
the
hearings
were
then
recessed
until
november
17,
1958.
i
omitted
to
say
but
mr.
bennett
has
already
mentioned
it
that
the
hearings
went
on
over
his
objection
when
he
moved
to
stay
the
hearings
as
indeed
he
did
until
the
antitrust
case
should
be
completed.
mr.
archibald
cox
we're
right
--
we're
right
there
your
honor.
during
the
recess,
the
department
of
justice
wrote
still
another
letter
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
pointed
out
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
date
of
the
--
to
be
resumed
hearings
before
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
pre-trial
conference
in
utah
on
the
antitrust
case.
and
again,
he
asked
the
commission
to
stay
its
hand
until
the
antitrust
case
could
be
disposed
of.
the
federal
power
--
the
chairman
of
the
federal
power
commission
then
wrote
a
letter
to
judge
ritter
who
is
the
judge
in
the
district
of
utah
which
appears
at
page
--
beginning
at
page
75
of
our
brief
and
i
think
that
it's
--
whereas
taking
some
of
the
time
of
the
court
to
call
attention
to
parts
of
that
letter.
on
page
76
in
the
latter
part
of
the
paragraph
on
top
of
the
page,
mr.
crookendale
(ph)
wrote
and
this
was
to
the
judge,
in
view
of
the
urgency
of
the
matter
as
indicated
by
our
staff
investigation
and
the
pleas
of
various
public
bodies.
we
felt
that
it
was
proper
for
us
to
proceed
with
the
testimony
in
our
cases
and
to
determine
at
the
time
of
considering
the
merits
of
the
case
whether
the
application
for
merger
should
await
the
judicial
determination
of
antitrust
charges.
then
he
went
on
and
said
that
the
anti
--
that
the
department
of
justice
had
been
invited
to
participate
and
it
wasn't
there
that
there
was
therefore
no
proper
way
of
having
argued
before
the
federal
power
commission
of
the
department
of
justice's
wish
to
have
the
federal
power
commission
proceedings
stead.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
this
is
not
the
california
utility
commission.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
--
the
other
--
the
utility
commissions
in
the
northwest
and
indeed
a
number
of
them
all
through
the
western
part
of
the
united
states
came
in
in
support
of
the
application.
mr.
archibald
cox
of
the
application
for
the
merger
and
in
addition,
we're
strongly
urging
a
speed.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
and
they
came
in
as
formal
parties.
then
by
mr.
crookendale
(ph)
went
on
to
say,
“we
understand
that
el
paso
filed
in
your
court
on
october
2,
1958,
the
motion
to
postpone
the
antitrust
trial
and
that
this
motion
will
be
before
you
and
you
will
have
an
opportunity
to
hear
both
parties
on
this
question
as
to
whether
we
should
proceed
with
the
merger
hearing
or
you
should
proceed
with
the
antitrust
case.”
if
you
--
i'll
skip
a
sentence.
“if
you
deny
el
paso's
motion
and
decide
to
proceed
with
the
antitrust
trial,
we
will
continue
our
merger
proceedings
to
a
date
which
will
not
conflict
with
your
court
trial.
if
you
sustain
the
motion
of
el
paso
for
a
continuance,
we
will
proceed
with
our
hearings.”
the
motion
was
thereafter
argued
in
the
district
court
and
judge
ritter
entered
a
formal
order
mr.
chief
justice
staying
further
proceedings
in
the
antitrust
case
until
the
commission
should
have
completed
its
action
upon
the
application
for
approval
of
the
merger.
there's
one
further
thing
which
i
think
is
worth
mentioning
about
the
district
judges'
action.
during
the
oral
argument
on
the
motion,
he
did
indicate
his
view
tentatively
of
the
posture
in
which
the
antitrust
case
would
be
left.
he
said,
“if
the
federal
power
commission
denies
the
merger
you,
meaning
the
attorneys
from
the
department
of
justice
will
go
right
ahead
with
this.
if
the
federal
power
commission
allows
the
merger,
then
i
want
to
hear
you
out
of
question
of
law
involved
in
that
provision”
referring
to
the
last
paragraph
that
i
read,
the
last
sentence
that
i
read
in
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
that
shall
not
apply
to
transactions
duly
authorized
by
the
federal
power
commission.
the
federal
power
commission
case
then
went
ahead
to
the
conclusion
and
the
merger
was
approved.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
represented
as
a
commission
in
any
way
in
the
department
of
justice
which
alone
spoke
for
the
government
was
urging
that
the
case
to
go
ahead,
the
motion
be
denied.
mr.
archibald
cox
just
about,
just
about.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
our
view
with
respect
--
i
think
i'm
going
to
answer
you
in
one
moment.
it'd
be
a
little
more
orderly
if
i
might
get
in
two
or
three
sentences
first.
the
answer
in
general
is
yes,
but
i'll
explain
it.
i
was
just
going
to
state
because
i
think
it's
helpful
as
background
although
a
little
broader
than
the
issues
that
have
to
be
decided.
i'd
like
to
set
forth
what
i
understand
to
be
the
ultimate
aims
of
the
--
mr.
bennett's
argument,
el
paso's
argument
and
the
government's
position
with
respect
to
these
two
proceedings
then
i
will
narrow
myself
to
this
particular
case.
as
i
understand
mr.
bennett,
he
says
that
the
federal
power
commission
should
have
yielded
to
the
district
court
and
has
not
gone
beyond
that.
i
do
not
understand
what
effect
he
thinks
the
federal
power
commission's
order
if
approved
will
have
in
the
district
court
proceeding.
i
guess
he
takes
no
position
on
that.
now,
el
paso's
ultimate
position
and
it's
argued
in
the
brief
here
is
that
the
final
sentence
in
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
plus
the
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
approving
the
merger
takes
the
whole
transaction
out
from
under
the
clayton
act
and
that
the
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
will
be
a
defense
in
the
antitrust
case
in
utah.
my
position
is
in
between.
it
is
that
both
the
court
and
the
federal
power
commission
as
i
said
before
had
jurisdiction
and
both
could
go
forward
or
either
as
a
matter
of
committee
could
yield
to
the
other.
that
the
effect
of
the
federal
power
--
federal
power
commission
certificate
should
be
argued
out
in
the
antitrust
case
and
in
the
antitrust
case
when
that
is
done,
we
will
urge
that
it
should
be
held
that
the
federal
power
commission
certificate
does
not
immunize
the
transaction
from
prosecution
under
the
clayton
act.
now,
to
answer
your
question
directly,
unless
something
in
the
opinion
or
outcome
of
this
case
stands
in
a
way,
it
is
the
--
intention
of
the
department
of
justice
to
proceed
with
the
antitrust
case
as
soon
as
judge
ritter's
order
permits
which
would
be
upon
the
disposition
of
this
proceeding
here
assuming
there's
a
--
an
affirmance.
so
we
do
subject
to
something
that
may
develop
in
the
opinion.
we
do
intend
to
go
ahead.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
the
--
the
complaint
as
it
stands
request
that
completely
divestiture.
and
i
intend
to
make
incline
that
we
retain
freedom
to
ask
for
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
mean
phys
--
i
couldn't
tell
you
how
difficult
the
physical
unscrambling
would
be
to
a
considerable
extent,
the
counts
have
been
kept
separate.
we
sought
a
temporary
injunction
but
it
was
denied
and
it
has
not
--
in
the
past,
appeals
have
not
been
taken
in
antitrust
cases
from
that
kind
of
order.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
what
you
said
that
it
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
certainly
say,
i
don't
recall
anything
in
that
case
or
in
any
other
case
that
says
that
an
agency
must
deny
a
certificate
if
there
has
been
a
prior
violation.
as
i
remember
that
case,
justice
frankfurter
does
say
that
in
regulated
industries,
the
notion
of
competition
has
a
somewhat
different
meaning.
it
calls
for
an
application
in
the
light
of
the
specific
conditions
of
that
industry
not
quite
as
generally
as
one
would
do
in
unregulated
industries.
perhaps
my
memory
is
at
fault
but
i
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
so
violating
stands
in
the
way
here.
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
case
closes
to
that
point
is
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
in
the
united
states
against
rca
dealing
with
the
radio
station
in
philadelphia
where
it
was
held
that
an
approval
by
the
federal
communications
commission
of
a
transfer
of
the
license
to
a
radio
station
did
not
immunize
the
transaction
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
we
would
argue
that
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
are.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
do
--
yes.
the
position
that
i'm
urging
here
is
--
is
not
the
same
as
the
position
that
was
urged
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
should
point
--
i
should
point
this
out.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice,
i
didn't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
you
should
not.
i
think
that
should
be
left
to
be
determined
in
the
district
court.
mr.
justice
to
answer
your
question
--
the
answer
to
your
question
lies
in
the
internal
governmental
organizational
arrangements.
the
solicitor
general
here
you
as
you
know
represents
all
the
branches
of
the
government,
and
i
represent
all
the
branches
of
the
government
in
the
contentions
i'm
making
except
i
should
have
said
that
the
commission
--
federal
power
commission
does
have
some
doubt
of
the
wisdom
of
the
position
that
the
department
of
justice
will
urge
in
the
district
court
in
utah
that
is
to
say
it
does
not
want
to
be
associated
with
the
view
that
its
order
does
not
immunize
the
transaction
under
the
antitrust
laws.
but
with
the
--
except
--
except
for
that,
i
am
today,
speaking
for
everyone.
now,
under
the
arrangements
that
prevail
in
the
circuit
courts,
the
government
not
infrequently
is
on
opposite
sides
of
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
mean
--
it
meant
specifically
antitrust
versus
the
commission,
the
solicitor
general
rankin
signed
that
brief
because
the
court's
rules
required
responsive
that
the
solicitor
general.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
he
faced
the
question
as
i
have
to
face
it
in
a
somewhat
broader
capacity.
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
i'm
speaking
here
for
the
department
of
justice
too
and
not
just
for
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
presume
it
would.
how
those
would
be
presented
in
this
court
is
a
problem
to
which
i'd
rather
not
address
myself
now
because
this
is
one
of
the
difficulties
the
solicitor
general
faces
sometimes.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
federal
power
commission
does
not
have
the
same
status
as
the
itc.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
antitrust
division
could
not
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
practice,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
it
is
such
point
was
necessarily
involved
in
the
case.
beyond
that,
i'm
afraid
i
just
have
to
plead
guilty
of
ignorance.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
at
the
moment,
judge
ritter
has
an
order
that
he
doesn't
intend
to
proceed
until
the
federal
power
commission
case
is
terminated.
i
suppose
if
this
court
entered
such
an
order,
he
would
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
a
question
which
i
had
not
considered
to
what
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
but
i
--
i
am
reluctant.
i'd
be
glad
to
say
to
the
court
a
formal
response
in
view
of
the
number
of
interest
in
the
government.
i'm
reluctant
to
give
and
i'll
come
in
answer
to
that.
may
i
outline
because
my
time
is
rushing
by.
what
seem
to
me
to
be
the
four
questions
that
are
presented
clearly,
with
relation
--
with
respect
to
the
relationship
between
the
federal
power
commission
case
and
the
antitrust
case.
the
first
is,
whether
the
filing
of
the
antitrust
suit,
outstood
the
federal
power
commission
of
jurisdiction,
of
power
to
act
upon
the
application
for
federal
power
commission
approval
of
the
merger.
and
we
think
that
clearly
it
did
not.
the
second
would
be,
whether
the
federal
power
commission
committed
reversible
error
it's
sailing
as
a
matter
of
committee
to
defer
action
until
the
antirust
case
had
been
completed.
the
third
and
fourth
are
substantive
questions.
did
the
federal
power
commission
applied
proper
standards
with
the
respect
to
the
effect
on
competition
in
determining
that
this
merger
was
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
then
the
fourth
which
seems
hardly
debatable
is
whether
the
commission's
finding
in
that
respect,
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
we
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
that
seem
to
me
that
if
the
--
if
there
had
been
--
if
it
had
been
felt
that
the
district
court's
decision
was
wrong
that
relief
could
have
been
sought
by
some
kind
of
mandamus
proceeding
in
this
court
to
make
it
go
first.
that
wasn't
done.
i
should
have
--
perhaps
the
mandamus
is
--
well,
we
have
a
question
as
to
whether
it
should
go
to
this
court
or
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
mandamus
in
an
appellant
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
sir.
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
no,
the
defendant
--
the
defendant
didn't
want
to.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
it
would
have
to
be
for
the
united
states
and
possibly
california
could
have
intervened,
so
they
didn't
and
i
don't
want
to
assert
if
they
could.
i
simply
suggest
--
mr.
archibald
cox
those
are
--
none
of
those
things
happened.
the
fact
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
say
first
that
it
was
--
certainly,
there
was
nothing
with
ousted
the
commission
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
to
whether
they
had
the
right?
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
although,
that
came
as
i
remember
came
later
after
a
decree
and
had
to
do
with
reopening
a
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
--
rather
than
when
the
case
was
pending,
which
also
they
might
have
come
in
a
permissive
status
without
independent
control
of
the
suit
which
is
i
remember
was
the
situation
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
commission
where
its
hearing
in
november
as
--
with
the
completion
of
the
hearings
in
november
is
scheduled,
the
examiner's
report
came
within
a
year
but
the
best
part
of
the
year
later,
the
commission's
final
decision
was
handed
down
very,
very
late
in
1959.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
judge's
order
was
back
in
--
mr.
archibald
cox
october
'58.
with
respect
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
all
i
have
time
to
say
now
is
that
the
natural
gas
act
upon
reading,
clearly
sets
up
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
regulation
which
nowhere
suggests
that
the
proceedings
of
that
commission
are
to
be
subordinated
to
the
antitrust
policy.
and
this
is
also
implicit,
we
think,
in
the
standard
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
by
which
the
commission
is
to
guide
itself
in
making
decisions.
for
that
standard
although,
it
requires
the
commission
to
consider
the
effect
upon
competition
of
any
proposed
action,
it
simply
thinks
that
one
factor
in
the
total
analysis
and
obviously
doesn't
require
it
to
subordinate
all
other
factors
to
consideration
of
the
effect
on
competition.
and
the
legislative
history
as
we
point
out
shows
that
the
congressman
most
postly
associated
with
the
measure
recognize
that
the
concept
of
the
public
interest
might
involve
decisions
which
lessened
rather
than
increased
competition.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
committee,
i
would
simply
urge
that
taking
all
the
factors
into
account,
the
commission
here
did
not
abuse
its
discretion,
did
not
err
in
any
reversible
way
in
concluding
that
it
should
go
first.
there
was
a
good
deal
of
evidence
in
front
of
it
that
the
situation
of
specific
was
while
not
desperate
certainly
that
it
was
in
some
financial
strays.
there
were
tax
savings
to
be
achieved
by
going
ahead.
the
antitrust
case
had
been
filed
a
year
before
and
hadn't
been
tried
and
if
it'd
be
true
as
it
would
be
true
that
the
decision
in
the
district
court
would
have
been
some
help
to
the
commission
is
equally
possible
that
their
decision
by
the
commission
would
be
a
help
to
the
district
court.
finally
and
most
important,
i
call
attention
again
to
chairman
crookendall
letter
to
the
district
judge
and
having
received
the
district
judge's
response
in
the
form
of
an
order,
we
submit
that
the
commission
did
the
only
reasonable
thing.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
there
was
an
effort
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we've
tried
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we're
trying
to
prevent
the
scrambling
mr.
justice.
there
was
an
effort
to
get
an
injunction
from
district
judge
and
he
denied
it.
as
you
know
those
temporary
orders
are
not
normally
taken
up
under
the
expediting
act
so
that
sometimes
these
mergers
unfortunately
are
consummated
pending
the
determination
of
the
litigation.
now,
i
do
not
have
the
time
to
--
because
i
agreed
to
give
mr.
dean
half
an
hour.
i
do
not
have
the
time
to
dwell
on
the
commission's
resolutions
of
substantive
issue
concerning
competition.
but
i
think
anyone
who
reads
the
examiner's
opinion
and
the
commission's
opinion
will
find
that
there
were
various
substantial
reasons
for
concluding
that
pacific
as
things
then
stood
offered
little
potential
competition,
the
situation
--
they're
speculative
at
best
and
that
there
were
prospects
of
much
greater
competition
from
two
other
pipeline
company,
pacific
gas
transmission
and
transwestern.
furthermore,
the
consideration
as
to
which
i
adverted
my
statement
to
facts
where
the
strongest
of
countervailing
argument
that
the
merger
would
benefit
the
consumers
of
california
by
giving
them
an
assured
supply
which
without
the
reserves
of
pacific
where
it
was
at
least
somewhat
uncertain.
i
want
to
say
just
one
word
in
the
moment
remaining
about
mr.
bennett's
argument
with
respect
to
rates.
this
requires
one
do
--
define
a
little
more
particularly
what
he
means
when
he
charges
that
the
commission
refused
to
investigate
what
the
ensuing
rates
would
be.
it's
perfectly
plain
that
the
examiner
and
the
commission
itself
did
investigate
in
general
of
what
the
probable
effect
and
costs
would
be
and
of
course
cost
are
the
things
that
you
start
with
including
capital
cost
in
fixing
rates.
and
there,
it
was
found
on
good
deal
of
evidence
that
while
the
precise
amount
couldn't
be
stated
that
there
would
be
a
lowering
of
cost
on
the
whole
system.
now,
the
second
thing
mr.
bennett
seems
to
say
is
that
the
commission
failed
to
go
into
the
question
whether
pacific's
higher
costs
and
its
cost
were
higher
than
el
paso's
would
be
rolled
into
el
paso's
cost
so
that
the
california
consumers
would
be
paying
part
of
the
cost
to
getting
gas
to
the
pacific
northwest.
the
short
answer
to
that
is,
that
the
commission
carefully
attached
to
the
certificate,
a
condition
reserving
for
future
rate
proceedings
were
it
belong,
all
questions
of
the
allocation
of
cost
and
in
order
the
el
paso
to
keep
its
books
in
a
way
that
we
keep
separates
for
all
purposes
of
the
cost
of
the
pacific
northwest
as
parts
of
the
merged
company
and
the
el
paso
part
so
that
that
question
as
to
the
proper
allocation
of
cost
will
remain
entirely
open
and
there
is
no
possible
prejudice
to
the
california
consumers
in
that
respect.
now,
mr.
bennett
also
says
he
was
denied
the
rank
to
cross-examine
with
respect
to
cost.
i
--
there's
no
record
reference
in
his
brief
for
that
and
i
frankly
don't
know
just
what
he
refers
to.
if
he
is
referring
to
this
question
of
rolling
in
pacific
northwestern's
higher
cost,
that
is
true,
the
answers
to
what
i
gave.
if
he
is
referring
to
cost
in
the
broader
sense
then
i
simply
don't
know
the
basis
for
the
contention.
i
think
he's
mistaken.
the
--
i've
forgotten
what
the
one
additional
word.
i
wanted
to
say
was
mr.
chief
justice
so
i'll
turnover
to
mr.
dean.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
bad.
well,
i
understood
his
suggestion
was
that
the
case
be
held
on
the
docket
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
didn't
--
you
didn't
understand
my
answer
because
i
requested
leave
to
defer
answering
that
because
of
the
number
of
government
agencies
involved.
i'd
be
happy
to
supply
a
written
answer
and
send
copies
to
counsel
but
i
don't
think
i
ought
to
answer
of
that
question
off
the
court
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you.
