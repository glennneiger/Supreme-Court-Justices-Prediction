chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
number
48,
carl
still,
petitioner,
versus
norfolk
and
western
railway
company.
mr.
sachs.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question
mr.
sachs.
as
i
understand
it,
he
worked
from
1951
to
1956
and
under
this
original
employment
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
then
he
was
dismissed
for
some
cause
having
nothing
to
do
with
his
physical
condition.
he
was
out
a
year
and
so
on,
and
he
came
back
and
worked
a
year
or
so,
and
then
was
injured.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
did
he
have
--
did
they
give
him
any
physical
examination?
were
there
any
other
representations
when
they
brought
him
back
the
second
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
believe
that
it
affects
the
case
in
--
as
it
comes
to
us
in
some
way
or
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sanders.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
the
--
what
did
the
examining
physician
say
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
of
course
a
jury
might
be
able
to
find
that
there
would
be
a
difference
between
the
doctor
remembering
and
the
employee
remembering
because
of
the
fact
that
the
employee
was
examined
once
and
the
doctor
probably
examined
thousands
of
people
in
that
regard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
saying
its
true,
but
i
just
say
a
jury
might
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
couldn't
a
jury
consider
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
what
his
work
record
was
with
the
comp
--
with
your
company
over
the
eight
years
between
the
time
he
first
came
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
meant
his
physical
condition
during
the
time
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
worked
there.
he
was
--
i
understood
he
was
there
about
five
years,
was
off
a
year,
and
then
after
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
year
and
a
half
or
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
have
any
illness
record
in
those
five
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
what
was
--
what
was
the
condition
of
his
health
and
his
ability
to
work
during
those
five
years,
from
1951
to
1956?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
reemployed
him
after
he
was
off
for
a
year,
after
that
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
put
him
back
to
work
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
used
it
in
that
--
in
that
sense,
but
i
--
but
i
wonder
if
this
has
any
bearing
on
it.
he
came
back
in
november
1956
and
worked
until
february
1958,
and
in
that
year
and
four
months,
he
was
only
off
three
days.
once
by
permission,
once
by
--
for
sickness
with
a
sore
throat,
and
once
just
off
sick
in
a
year
and
four
months
after
he
was
re
--
he
came
back.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i've
just
seen
it,
it's
on
the
last
page
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
509,
and
it's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
right
at
the
very
end,
rather
at
the
very
end
of
the
exhibit
here.
that's
what
it
--
that's
what
it
shows.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
there
eight
years
on
the
job.
suppose
he'd
been
there
10
years
more,
and
that
then
become
injured,
would
the
fraud
that
you
claim
hold
over
that
long,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
makes
him
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
sachs.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
