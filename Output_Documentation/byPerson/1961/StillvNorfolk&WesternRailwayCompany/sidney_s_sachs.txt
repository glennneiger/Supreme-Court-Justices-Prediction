mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
proceeding
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
which
culminated
by
the
direction
of
a
verdict
by
the
trial
judge
on
the
ground
that
the
employee
who
had
sued
for
his
personal
injuries
had
misrepresented
as
principally
his
physical
condition
when
he
procured
employment
seven
years
before
this
accident
happened.
there
are
two
questions
which
are
presented
to
the
court.
the
first
is
one
which
has
been
before
the
court
many
times
and
which
we
will
not
argue
unless
asked
to
do
so.
it
is
the
question
as
to
whether
the
evidence
was
of
such
a
nature
as
to
justify
the
courts
depriving
this
man
of
his
right
to
jury
trial
under
the
act.
the
issue
on
which
he
ruled
was
fraud.
it
is
elementary
of
course
that
in
order
to
establish
that
defense,
the
respondent
had
to
show
clearly
that
the
employee
had
falsely
misrepresented.
material
facts
with
intention
to
deceive
the
railroad
that
in
fact
the
railroad
had
relied
on
his
misrepresentations
and
that
it
had
been
reasonable
in
so
relying.
this
record
is
replete
with
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
evidence.
the
petitioner
denied
that
he
had
a
fraudulent
intention.
as
to
each
of
those
elements
and
the
sub-elements
within
each
of
them,
there
were
questions
for
the
jury
under
the
principles
which
this
court
had
enumerate
--
has
enumerated.
in
fact,
as
to
two
of
those
issues,
we
submit,
that
the
only
reasonable
inferences
were
favorable
to
the
petitioner
and
in
fact
therefore,
as
to
this
one
issue,
there
should
have
been
a
directed
verdict
in
his
favor.
the
novel
question
which
this
case
presents
is
whether
the
defense
of
fraud
in
a
case
such
as
this,
states
a
valid
defense
in
any
case,
in
any
event.
this
man
briefly
stating
the
facts
which
relate
to
that
point
was
24
years
old
when
he
was
employed
on
july
24th,
1951.
he
was
employed
at
bluefield,
west
virginia.
the
record
shows
that
he
filed
a
written
application
on
that
day,
on
the
form
provided
by
the
respondent.
on
that
day
and
apparently
on
the
morning
of
the
next
day,
he
was
physically
examined
by
the
respondent's
medical
examiner.
he
answered
all
the
questions
on
the
application.
he
gave
references.
he
gave
the
name
for
example
of
a
veteran's
administration
--
of
a
doctor
in
bluefield,
a
town
of
20,000,
who
examined
for
the
veteran's
administration.
the
only
investigation
conducted
by
the
respondent
consisted
of
the
medical
examination
which
each
--
which
its
examiner
gave
the
petitioner.
that
examiner
said
that
it
was
a
thorough
examination.
he
also
said
that
at
that
time
he
was
--
he
had
more
than
he
could
do.
he
was
crowded
and
had
more
than
he
could
do.
there
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
application
in
1951
a
rule
which
is
standard
apparently
among
in
the
railroad
industry
and
has
been
before
this
court
before,
which
--
which
stated
that,
“applications
for
employment
will
be
accepted
or
rejected
within
30
days.
if
not
notified
within
30
days,
applicant
will
be
considered
as
accepted.”
as
i
have
said,
the
respondent
made
no
investigation
whatsoever
of
this
applicant.
it
did
not
even
ask
him
to
produce
his
certificate
of
honorable
discharge
from
the
service.
may
i
digress
just
for
one
moment
to
state
a
fact
that
i
should
have
stated.
the
critical
omission
which
the
respondent
complains
of
was
a
low-back
condition
known
as
“spondylolisthesis”
which
the
petitioner
had
for
many
years
which
apparently
was
congenital.
it
was
marked
by
a
depression
in
his
lower
back
which
was
visible
to
an
examining
doctor.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
i
do
not
mean
sir
that
that
is
true
in
every
case,
but
this
record
shows
that
in
this
case
there
was
evidence
of
it.
the
testimony
was
that
frequently
the
condition
is
marked
--
it
is
indicated
by
an
extreme
lordosis
or
some
kind
of
a
depression
in
the
lower
back
which
is
--
which
indicates
the
ailment
and
at
least
is
sufficient
to
awaken
the
suspicions
of
an
examining
doctor
who
then
certainly
should
procure
an
x-ray
to
confirm
it.
the
--
these
are
the
essential.
i
have
given
you
the
essential
facts,
i
believe,
which
relate
to
this
defense
of
fraud.
the
trial
court
held
as
the
respondent
claims
that
this
man
was
not
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
and
was
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
that
act.
the
decision
of
this
question
really
commences
with
the
decision
of
this
court
in
minneapolis,
and
--
minneapolis,
st.
pete
--
st.
paul
&
sault
ste.
marie
railroad
company
versus
rock,
which
was
decided
in
1929
by
this
court.
in
that
case
a
man
named
joe
--
the
facts
there,
it's
important
to
understand
those
facts
in
order
to
compare
them
to
those
with
petitioner.
there,
a
man
named
joe
rock
applied
for
work
with
the
railroad.
he
failed
the
examination
for
a
number
of
reasons.
a
few
days
later
using
the
name
of
john
rock,
he
applied
again
for
employment.
and
he
obtained
a
friend
of
his,
a
third
party
entirely,
to
submit
to
the
physical
examination.
the
medical
examiner
examined
joe
rock's
friend,
thought
he
was
john
rock
and
passed
the
exam
--
passed
the
application.
joe
rock
under
the
name
john
rock
then
commenced
to
work
for
the
railroad
and
about
15
months
later
he
was
injured.
this
court
reversed
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
in
that
case.
it
held
essentially
as
i
understand
the
opinion
that
what
rock
had
done
was
so
abhorrent
to
the
public
policy
of
the
fela
that
he
--
although
he
may
have
been
an
employee
he
was
not
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
this
act
and
was
not
entitled
to
the
protection
which
the
act
afforded.
the
court
did
not
discuss
the
case
in
terms
of
common
law
contract
in
fraud
principles.
it
did
not
discuss
the
basic
proposition
that
any
contract
is
--
which
is
induced
by
fraud
is
voidable
not
void.
that
a
contract
is
void,
a
contract
of
employment
for
example
when
the
employer
hires
one
other
than
he
thinks
it
is
employed.
the
--
the
nub
of
the
opinion
as
i
have
said
lie
in
the
court's
statement
that
the
purpose
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
one
of
the
principal
purposes,
is
to
provide
--
is
to
provide
safety
for
the
employees
and
the
public.
that
the
machinery
for
providing
that
safety
is
the
--
personally,
one
of
the
principle
machineries
at
least
is
the
personal
injury
action
which
is
afforded
the
injured
worker.
and
because
of
the
threat
of
that,
there
is
a
stimulus
built
into
the
act
for
the
railroad
to
be
careful
in
its
hiring
procedures.
and
so
the
court
said
in
that
case
and
in
another
case
involving
the
same
railroad
a
few
years
later,
it
paraphrased
the
rock
holding
by
saying
that
the
nub
--
that
the
point
of
the
rock
case
was
that
rock
have
fraudulently
evaded
the
company's
rule
requiring
applicants
to
submit
to
a
physical
examination,
that
was
why
rock
lost.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
that's
our
first
point.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
i
think
there
were
not,
i'm
not
positive.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
i
think
that
is
a
point,
i
would
certainly
not
disagree
with
that
point.
that
does
not
state
our
principal
contention
as
we
state
it.
we
think
there
is
a
greater
difference
than
that
between
the
rock
case
and
this
case.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
for
the
reason,
and
that
is
the
point
that
i'm
now
coming
to.
the
fraud,
if
there
was
a
fraud
and
we
don't
concede
it,
that
still
perpetrated
on
the
norfolk
and
western
railroad
did
not
keep
it
from
examining
him.
it
did
not
set
to
note
as
this
court
said
in
the
rock
case,
the
railroad's
practice
and
procedure
which
it
had
set
up
in
order
to
carry
out
its
duty
to
hire
competent
employees.
in
the
rock
case,
the
court
said,
“a
railroad
has
a
duty
to
hire
competent
employees.”
rock
thwarted
that
duty.
it
made
it
impossible
in
that
case
for
the
railroad
to
do
that.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
to
the
court
that
the
rock
case
has
been
criticized.
today
for
instance,
in
candor,
it
seems
to
me
and
--
it
maybe
said
that
what
i
say
now
is
somewhat
contrary
to
our
position
but
i
don't
think
it
is,
that
today,
the
court
might
even
find
in
the
rock
case
that
he
should
have
recovered
because
for
example,
fingerprints
would
have
prevented
the
kind
of
a
fraud
that
rock
perpetrated.
that
would
leave
the
case
as
one,
not
too
distinguishable
formalities,
but
that
wasn't
discussed
in
the
rock
case
and
therefore
in
our
case
we
come,
i
submit,
clearly
within
the
basic
rule
that
there
was
nothing
more
here
than
--
if
you
concede
what
we
don't
concede,
than
a
fraud
in
the
inducement
which
possibly
gave
the
railroad
the
right
to
fire
still,
but
not
to
deprive
him
of
his
protection
as
an
employee.
i
may
say
to
your
honors
that
in
december
1959,
following
the
trial
of
this
case,
there
was
a
hearing
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
original
contract
in
which
he
was
fired
for
the
misrepresentations
which
are
the
subject
matter
of
this
case.
i
would
like
to
make
one
additional
point,
and
that
is
that
unless
the
court
finds
that
the
defense
raised
in
this
case,
this
fraud
defense,
is
inappropriate
in
such
a
situation,
the
result
will
be
to
thwart
the
very
public
policy
which
the
court
relied
upon
in
ruling
as
it
did
in
the
rock
case.
because
if
any
misrepresentation,
easily
discoverable
at
the
time
of
hiring
is
to
be
allowed
to
the
railroad
as
a
defense,
when
an
injury
occurs
years
after,
an
employee
has
undertaken
his
work
with
the
railroad,
the
only
result
can
be
to
generate
a
feeling
of
confidence,
a
laxity
if
you
will,
in
the
hiring
procedures,
which
the
railroad
will
follow.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
--
the
basic
policy
of
the
fela
calls
of
a
decision
in
the
petitioner's
favor
on
both
these
issues
--
on
the
second
issue,
we
think
we're
right
also
in
the
first.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
that's
--
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
the
precise
answer
to
your
question
is
that
they
examined
his
--
that
they
say
they
examined
his
eyes
only.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
he
says
they
examined
him.
the
record
shows
that
under
their
procedures,
they
were
supposed
to
examine
his
eyes
and
his
hearing.
and
a
fair
statement
your
honor
of
our
point
which
you
have
paraphrased
would
compel
us
to
say
that
he
was
dismissed
in
1956
for
deserting
his
crew.
then,
he
was
reinstated
in
november
1957
with
loss
of
vacation
rights
and
loss
of
pay,
but
not
loss
of
seniority.
the
respondent
claims
therefore
that
that
was
a
continuation
of
the
original
employment,
we
say
it
was
not.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
we
believe
that
that
affects
the
case
on
our
first
proposition
because
if
he
was
rehired
in
1957,
independent
of
his
1951
application,
then
it
cannot
be
said
that
when
he
was
injured
in
january
1958,
his
employment
existed
because
the
railroad
was
relying
on
his
false
1951
statements.
thank
you.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
may
i
say
briefly
if
it
please
the
court.
there
are
just
--
there's
as
much
conflict
in
this
evidence
as
there
is
between
counsel
and
me
as
to
whether
there
is
a
conflict
and
that
in
other
words
is
a
complete
conflict
of
evidence
as
to
whether
there
was
fraud
and
how
the
accident
happened
and
what
the
damages
where?
this
--
i
think
that
i
should
say
your
honor,
to
correct
a
misapprehension
that
i
think
may
exist
in
your
mind
that
the
period
that
he
worked
after
he
came
back
following
his
dismissal
was
from
november
1957
till
january
1958.
it
was
a
short
time.
mr.
sidney
s.
sachs
yes.
but
his
work
record
is
of
significance.
there's
--
and
in
the
--
what
counsel
has
pointed
to
as
frequent
signing
off
for
sick
is
of
significance.
there's
no
evidence
to
establish
what
the
practice
was.
it
maybe
assumed
that
on
the
railroads
as
in
many
government
offices
and
other
offices,
people
sign
off
sick
when
they're
not
sick.
but
if
they
don't
do
that,
then
certainly,
this
list
--
this
constant
stream
of
checking
off
sick
was
warning
to
this
employer
that
something
was
wrong
and
adds
to
the
argument
we
have
that
it
knew
or
should
have
known
that
this
man
was
not
well.
we
don't
concede
that's
a
fact
because
the
evidence
was
by
his
fellow
employees
and
his
superiors
that
in
fact,
he
was
one
of
the
most
strongest,
one
of
the
strongest
and
most
able
breaker
while
he
worked.
thank
you
your
honor.
