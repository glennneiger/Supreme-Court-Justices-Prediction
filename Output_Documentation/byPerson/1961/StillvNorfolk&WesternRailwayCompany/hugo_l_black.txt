i
suppose
the
company
came
to
that
conclusion
long
before
they
entered
this
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
what's
with
all
this
record
(inaudible)?
i
understood
you
to
say
that
we
could
look
at
it
and
see
if
that
is
(inaudible)

(voice

justice

(inaudible)
one
thing
about
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
records
shows
the
company
didn't
know
anything
about
this
list
of
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
this
made
out
from?
what
was
this
made
out
from
reasons
for
evidence?
where
was
it
copied
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whose
records?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
railway
company's
records.
justice
hugo
l.
black
day
to
day?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
they
didn't
know
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
there's
no
inference
that
we
can
draw
from
this
then
is
it
that
you
would
say
that
the
company
couldn't
draw
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
conclusively
contradicted
you
say
because
the
company
knew
about
it
and
had
the
record
of
it
and
has
it
on
file
all
the
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
kept
him
in
employment.
that
is,
i
gather,
he
was
not
an
employee,
he
was
just
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
i'm
not
sure
about
it,
but
suppose
the
railroad
has
filed
an
application
to
remove
him
from
his
employment,
cancelled
the
original
contract
on
the
ground
that
its
fraud
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
five
or
six
years
after
he
had
made
these
alleged
fraudulent
decisions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
statute
limitations
or
the
principles
of
(inaudible)
or
negligence
is
raised
had
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
could
have
discharged
him
at
any
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
have
to
discharge
him
as
i
gather,
because
he
wasn't
employed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
he
get
hurt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
he
get
hurt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
it
was
a
large
or
small
impact,
did
his
back
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
it
was
a
large
impact
or
a
small
impact,
did
this
so-called
spendecula
or
sponocity
or
whatever
it
was
have
anything
to
do
with
his
accident?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
evidence
show
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
he
wasn't
hurt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see.
well,
then
in
fact,
he
couldn't
had
much
to
do
with
it,
could
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
a
certain
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
the
jury
would
have
to
pass
on
if
this
case
were
sent
back,
isn't
it,
those
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
that
would
be
admissible
in
evidence
if
the
case
was
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
somebody
had
to
pass
on
the
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
they
haven't
yet
done.
