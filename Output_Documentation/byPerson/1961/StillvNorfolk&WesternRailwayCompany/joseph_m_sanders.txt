mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
if
the
court
please?
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
is
unlike
most
of
the
fela
cases
in
that
in
this
case
the
facts
were
substantially
un-contradicted.
it's
an
unusual
thing,
but
that
is
a
fact.
our
friend,
i
think
will
agree
with
me
except
on
one
point,
he
will
say
that
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
in
this.
he
will
say
that
when
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
applied
for
employment
to
the
respondent
in
1951,
and
after
he
had
filled
out
himself
and
signed
a
written
application
for
employment,
he
was
examined
by
the
medical
examiner
for
the
respondent.
the
medical
examiner
testified
that
he
inquired,
asked
the
petitioner
many
questions
appearing
on
the
physical
examination
card,
and
recorded
those
answers
as
written,
and
that
card
is
in
evidence
in
the
case,
but
here
is
the
point.
the
petitioner
at
that
time
at
one
place
in
his
testimony
denied
that
the
medical
examiner
asked
him
any
questions,
whatever.
however,
in
other
parts
of
his
testimony,
it
is
entirely
clear
that
the
medical
examiner
did
interrogate
him,
did
ask
him
questions.
he
stated
he
did
not
remember
what
the
conversation
was.
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
was
examined
in
july
of
1951
by
the
medical
examiner
and
this
case
was
not
tried
and
until
october
of
1959
more
than
eight
years
following
that
examination.
then,
i
make
this
statement
and
i
make
it
advisedly,
i
submit
that
when
the
petitioner
testifies
that
he
remembered
the
conversation
occurring
and
remember
that
no
conversation
did
occur
at
that
examination
which
he
successfully
passed,
that
when
he
testified
that
he
remembered
that
no
questions
were
asked
him
by
the
medical
examiner
on
that
occasion,
i
submit
that
that
testimony
is
incredible
and
unworthy
of
belief.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
the
examining
physician
testified
of
course,
your
honor,
as
he
should
have
testified,
as
anybody.
he
said,
“i
have
no
recollection
of
the
examination,
i
must
rely
on
my
record.”
and
had
he
said
anything
else,
i
think
i
would
have
been
embarrassed
because
i
would
have
known
or
i
certainly
would
have
thought
that
he
was
telling
an
untruth,
then
i
think
that
most
anyone
else
would
come
to
that
conclusion,
medical
examiner
get
on
understand
and
testified
that
he
remembered
the
conversation
that
occurred
when
he
gave
a
physical
examination
eight
years
ago,
when
nothing
unusual
occurred
at
the
examination
to
impress
it
on
his
memory,
i
would
have
very
serious
doubts
about
the
credibility
of
that
medical
examiner.
(inaudible)
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
yes.
i
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
i
don't
believe
that's
true
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
in
other
words,
i
submit
that
this
is
a
reasonable
and
logical
proposition.
i
don't
believe
--
of
course
my
opinion
is
immaterial,
but
i
submit
that
no
person
regardless
of
his
intellect
or
his
memory,
who
took
an
examination
say
for
life
insurance
eight
years
ago
and
successfully
passed
that
examination,
and
nothing
unusual
occurred
at
that
examination
to
impress
that
on
his
memory,
i
would
say
that
it
is
incredible
for
him
to
attempt
to
testify
what
was
said
by
the
medical
examiner
and
what
was
said
by
him
during
that
examination.
and
not
only
that,
within
this
case,
we're
not
dealing
with
a
man
with
that
kind
of
a
memory
because
he
himself
admits
and
testified
at
one
place
where
he
said,
“i
can
hardly
remember
1958.
i
can
hardly
remember
what
happened
in
1958.”
he
had
been
employed
on
two
previous
occasions
by
respondent;
one
time
in
1943
and
one
time
in
1948,
he
passed
those
examinations.
he
made
the
same
false
representations
on
those
occasions
that
he
made
in
1951
and
that
isn't
denied.
he
simply
says,
“i
don't
remember
being
examined
in
1943
and
1948,”
but
in
view
of
those
things,
first,
the
fact
that
he
was
testifying
to
an
occurrence
that
occurred
more
than
eight
years
before
the
trial
and
the
second,
he
has
admitted
lack
of
memory,
his
very
poor
memory,
i
submit
sincerely
that
that
type
of
evidence
is
incredible
and
i
know
the
courts
in
many
instances
say
that
testimony
is
incredible
and
that
the
jury
is
not
justified
in
believing
incredible
testimony
and
the
court
shouldn't
permit
a
jury
to
believe
him.
but,
with
that
exception,
my
friend
will
say
that
that
is
a
conflict.
i
say
it
isn't.
it's
properly
analyzed
and
considered.
there
is
no
substantial
conflict
in
the
testimony
in
this
case
and
that's
unusual.
now,
when
the
petitioner,
he
had
this
condition
of
his
back,
the
spondylolisthesis,
which
is
probably
congenital,
he
was
inducted
into
the
army
in
1945
and
he
was
examined
by
an
army
doctor
and
he
passed.
so
apparently,
the
army
doctor
didn't
discover
this
condition.
he
was
taken
into
the
army.
he
served
for
a
few
months
and
then
he
went
to
the
hospital
complaining
of
severe
pain
in
his
back
and
subsequently,
he
was
given
a
medical
discharge.
it
was
found
that
he
could
not
be
rehabilitated
to
perform
military
service.
he
was
given
a
medical
discharge
in
january
1946.
prior
to
that
time,
he'd
also
been
involved
in
an
automobile
accident
and
injured
his
back.
and
in
many
places
in
his
testimony,
he
attributed
his
discharge
from
the
army,
his
medical
discharge,
to
that
back
injury.
he
had
also
been
afflicted
with
seriously
disabling
rheumatism
for
many
years.
that
was
the
situation
when
he
made
application
to
the
respondent
for
employment
as
a
yard
breaker
and
i
might
add
this,
that
a
year
or
two
prior
to
that,
he
had
been
employed
by
another
coal
company
as
a
mine
breaker
and
had
had
to
quit
work
on
account
of
a
physical
disability,
worked
about
a
month.
then
he
makes
application
for
employment
to
respondent
as
a
yard
breaker.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
yes,
yes,
that's
very
important.
he
worked
from
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
oh,
well
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
that's
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
he
came
there,
he
started
in
july
of
1951,
and
as
a
--
and
he
was
--
about
1956,
i
believe
it
was
in
october,
he
deserted
his
crew
and
he
was
dismissed
from
service.
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
well,
i'm
not
quite
certain
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
assume
that
he
had
left
his
crew
while
they
were
working
without
proper
justification,
i'm
not
sure.
then
he
was
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
charge
he
was
dismissed.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
oh,
yes.
but
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
and
i'll
reach
that
fact
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
he
deserted
his
crew
and
he
was
dismissed
and
was
off
approximately
a
year,
and
then
he
was
reinstated.
his
--
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
interceded
for
him
and
he
was
reinstated
and
the
letter
under
which
he
was
reinstated
was
written
by
the
assistant
--
by
the
general
manager
of
respondent
to
the
chairman
of
the
brotherhood.
it
provided
that
he
would
be
reinstated.
he
would
lose
his
backpay
and
he
would
only
be
examined
as
to
his
eyes
and
his
hearing.
he
was
not
required
to
file
another
application.
he
didn't
file
it.
he
was
reinstated
with
his
seniority
rights
unimpaired
and
it
was
shown
without
any
contradiction
that
at
the
time
that
his
seniority
dated
from
july
24,
1951,
i
submit
that
that's
when
his
employment
dated
from.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
that's
our
position
in
the
case.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
that
is
shown
very
graphically
if
the
court
please,
in
a
record
which
we
--
that's
defendant's
exhibit
number
29,
record
--
page
506
of
the
record,
defendant's
exhibit
29.
now,
in
one
column,
that
covers
the
entire
period
from
july
19,
1951
to
february
the
2nd,
1958
when
he
marked
off
on
the
account
of
the
injury
which
he
says
that
he
sustained.
i
think
if
the
court
will
examine,
the
right
hand
column,
on
the
reason
for
absence
that
practically
every
month
during
that
entire
period,
the
petitioner
was
off
from
work
many
times
on
account
of
sickness.
and
was
off
on
--
on
many
occasions,
this
--
the
record
shows
off
by
permission.
now,
this
record
was
compiled
by
one
of
the
respondent's
clerks.
from
the
original
records
of
respondent,
which
were
produced
in
court
and
were
examined
by
petitioner's
attorneys
at
the
time.
there's
no
reason
to
doubt
the
accuracy
of
that
record.
i
will
not
take
time
to
go
through
that,
but
i
think
that
all
the
court
will
have
to
do
is
to
examine
this
column
on
the
reason
for
absence,
and
you
will
come
to
the
conclusion
necessarily
that
there
was
something
radically
wrong
with
the
petitioner
during
that
entire
time.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
the
evidence
is,
on
that
your
honor,
from
several
of
the
representatives
of
the
respondent
that
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
petitioner
was
not
physically
fit.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
that's
--
i
say,
that's
what
the
record
shows
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
--
that
he
was
off
sick
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
sir?
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
several
of
a
--
for
instance,
dr.
traft,
the
medical
examiner
testified
he
didn't
know
it
and
the
terminal
train
master
testified
that
he
didn't
know
it.
he
was
not
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
from
the
original
records
of
the
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
the
railway
company's
records.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
the
witnesses
who
testified
--
who
testified
at
the
trial
testified
that
they
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
not
physically
fit
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
railyard
breaker.
that
was
their
testimony,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
i
think
you
can
draw
this
inference,
that
there
was
some
reason
he
didn't
explain
why
he
was
off
from
work
on
account
of
sickness.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
petitioner
testified
repeatedly
that
he
never
missed
a
day
on
account
of
sickness.
that
he
was
strong
and
able
bodied,
healthy,
and
never
missed
a
day
on
account
of
sickness,
he
testified
to
that
repeatedly.
now,
i
submit
that's
conclusively
contradicted
by
the
records,
the
railway
company
here
that
he
did
miss
that
work.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
that
is
certainly
true
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
they
didn't
reemploy
him
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
well,
they
put
him
back
to
work
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
--
because
--
yes,
they
reinstated
him.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
but
i
submit
he
was
not
rehired
as
my
friend
to
contends.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
well,
i
certainly
assume
your
honor
has
read
it
correctly.
i
assume
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
i
merely
call
attention
to
that
and
i
placed
it
in
evidence
in
the
circuit
court
for
the
reason
that
the
counsel
for
petitioner
at
that
time
contented
that
here
was
a
man
that
was
in
spite
of
his
spondylolisthesis,
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
suffered
an
injury,
and
he'd
had
rheumatism,
and
had
made
these
misrepresentations,
yet
he
was
physically
fit.
and
i
think
one
of
the
--
his
own
witnesses
described
him
as
strongest
man
on
the
railroad
on
that
area.
so
i
think
that
that
record
clearly
contradicts
that
and
certainly
shows
that
something
was
wrong
with
that
man.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
on
the
grounds
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
not
that
i
know
of,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
the
application
which
he
signed
at
the
bottom
provided
in
substance
that
if
he
did
make
false
answers
to
the
questions,
that
he
could
be
discharged
even
without
a
hearing.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
well
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
they
could
have
discharged
him
--
i
mean,
that's
what
the
application
said,
but
we
who
know
about
collective
bargaining
agreements
know
that
it
could
not
have
been
done
without
a
hearing
and
without
very
considerable
difficulty.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
well,
that's
increasing
it
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
--
in
a
good
many
years.
your
honor,
i
am
inclined
to
believe
it
would
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
this
condition
that
he
had,
the
spondylolisthesis,
many
--
good
many
doctors
testified
in
this
case,
four
or
five
doctors
including
the
petitioners'
own
attending
physician,
and
they
said
that
with
--
a
man
in
this
condition
wasn't
physically
fit
for
employment
as
a
yard
breaker.
but
that's
the
uncontradicted
testimony
in
this
case
and
they
said
that
a
man
in
this
condition
could
very
easily
be
injured
and
he
could
develop
a
very
bad
condition
there
in
his
back
even
without
any
injury.
so
that
in
their
opinion,
that
no
medical
examiner
would
be
--
would
be
justified
in
approving
this
man
for
work
as
a
yard
breaker.
and
if
there's
one
thing
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows,
i
think
it
is
that
he
was
not
physically
fit.
it's
true
that
he
testified
and
others
testified
that
he
did
the
work
of
a
yard
breaker,
but
he
was
not
physically
fit
for
employment
as
a
yard
breaker.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
i
have
just
a
minute,
my
time
is
--
i
would
like
to
tell
the
court
that.
he
was
injured
in
the
switching
operation.
a
car,
the
end
car
--
they
were
taking,
breaking
up
a
train
and
taking
it
down
to
what
they
called
a
classification
tracks.
this
car
was
going
to
the
shop
track.
the
petitioner
got
on
this
car
and
got
up
on
the
break
step.
the
train
was
moving
very
slowly,
not
over
three
or
four
miles
an
hour
and
that
is
the
uncontradicted
testimony.
this
car
was
cut
off.
it
drifted
by
gravity
going
down
towards
the
west,
towards
the
classification
track.
it
was
followed
very
slowly
by
the
train
which
didn't
stop.
it
was
--
it
wasn't
intended
to
stop
the
train.
for
some
reason,
probably
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
applied
the
break
on
the
car
which
he
was
riding,
and
that's
shown
by
his
own
testimony,
the
train
which
was
gradually
following
that
car
overtook
it
and
coupled
to
it,
and
he
says
that
he
was
thrown
up
against
the
car
and
sustained
this
injury.
but
i
might
point
this
out,
that
if
as
the
uncontradicted
evidence
shows,
this
train
was
traveling
only
at
a
speed
of
three
to
four
miles
an
hour
as
it
followed
this
car
on
down
the
track
and
of
course,
the
car
was
moving
in
the
same
direction,
that
when
that
coupling
occurred,
the
impact
must
have
been
slight
indeed.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
i
didn't
quite
understand
that.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
well
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
the
evidence
shows
this
that
he
remained
on
this
car
until
it
stopped
and
he
climbed
down
off
the
car
unassisted
and
he
remained
on
the
job
the
all
night.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
your
honor,
that
--
my
opinion
is
not
involved
here,
but
i
think
others
could
come
to
that
same
opinion,
there
wasn't
any
accident
at
all.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
it's
exactly
right.
what
i
started
to
say
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
--
he
was
examined
the
next
day
by
an
orthopedic
surgeon
and
at
that
time,
there
were
no
bruises
or
marks
or
contusions
on
his
body,
whatever
and
he
was
making
no
complaint
whatever
of
his
back.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
none,
whatever
to
the
orthopedic
surgeon
that
examined
him
the
following
day,
none
whatever.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
oh,
it
is,
yes.
it
is
a
suit
for
damages.
he
claimed
that
he
was
knocked
off
of
this
car,
knocked
completely
off
of
the
car,
which
wasn't
true
and
he
fell
out
and
he
is
back
on
coupler
and
had
this
--
that
this
spondylolisthesis
was
caused
in
that
accident.
of
course,
the
spondylolisthesis
is
simply
a
displacement
forward
of
the
fifth
lumbar
vertebra
over
the
sacrum.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
it
is
a
displacement
forward
of
the
fifth
lumbar
vertebra
over
the
sacrum.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
about
half
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
about
half
--
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
--
of
the
fifth
lumbar
vertebra,
it
was
pushed
forward
over
the
sacrum
and
in
his
suit,
he
contented
that
that
is
the
condition
that
he
received
when
he
was
injured.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
there
is
one
fact,
whether
there
was
any
accident,
whether
there
was
any
injury,
because
the
x-ray
reports
which
we
produced
taken
when
he
was
in
the
army
and
by
the
veteran's
administration
show
that
the
condition
of
his
spine,
when
he
was
in
the
army
was
exactly
the
same
condition
that
it
was
in
at
the
time
of
this
trial.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
oh,
yes.
oh
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
oh,
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
joseph
m.
sanders
that's
right.
they
haven't
passed
on
that
because
the
court
did
not
indicate
--
did
not
--
it
didn't
go
to
the
jury
of
course,
and
that
would
be
a
jury
issue
if
this
case
goes
back,
thank
you,
gentlemen.
