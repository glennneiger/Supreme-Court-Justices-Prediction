justice

stewart
in
the
rock
case,
are
these
facts
all
conceded
by
the
plaintiff,
that
he
had
procured
somebody
else
to
take
the
physical
examination
for
him?
in
other
words,
in
this
case
here
we
have,
as
i
understand
to
your
position,
we
have
disputed
facts
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
misrepresentation.
in
the
rock
case,
were
the
facts,
and
it's
your
position
that
at
the
very
least,
these
controversies
of
fact
ought
to
be
submitted
to
a
jury?
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
at
least
one
of
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
positions.
in
the
rock
case,
were
there
disputed
facts?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
in
the
rock
case,
you
would
concede,
at
least
argumentatively
that
in
that
kind
of
a
case
perhaps
it
was
open
to
the
court
to
decide
as
a
matter
of
law,
when
the
facts
were
not
disputed,
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
procured
somebody
else
in
fact
to
take
his
physical
examination
and
maybe
in
that
kind
of
extreme
case,
there
was
nothing
for
the
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
even
if
the
railroad
is
right
in
its
version
of
the
facts
here,
that
this
case
is
different
from
rock?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
that
--
what
does
that
mean
in
his
employment,
deserting
his
crew,
sounds
like
a
military
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
just
curious,
that's
not
very
