mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
approach
this
argument
with
some
trepidation
after
the
spirit
of
exchange
took
place
with
mr.
doolittle
and
mr.
dietz.
this
is
a
rather
straightforward
tax
case
which
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
second
circuit.
it
does,
however,
involve
the
issue
of
how
far
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
may
go
in
extending
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
and
it
also
involves
the
conflict
of
circuits
and
that
the
third
and
the
sixth
circuits
have
decided
this
case
differently
than
the
second
circuit.
the
single
issue
that
is
presented
here
is
the
question
of
whether
a
taxpayer
who
pays
a
premium
for
a
bond,
which
is
subject
to
both
a
general
call
at
one
price
and
a
special
call
at
one
--
at
another
price,
lower
price,
may
deduct
the
difference
between
the
amount
that
he
pays
or
--
and
the
amount
of
the
general
call
price.
or
whether
he
may,
as
petitioners
contend
under
section
125
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
deduct
the
difference
between
what
he
paid
and
the
lower
special
call
price.
our
position,
we
submit,
is
supported
by
both
the
express
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
and
furthermore
is
supported
by
the
commissioner's
own
publicly
announced
position,
during
the
tax
year
involved
in
this
case,
a
position
which
he
did
not
reversed
until
1956,
three
years
after
the
year
in
question.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
between
the
years
1951
through
1956.
first
ruling
was
issued
in
1951.
the
commissioner
reversed
this
position
in
1956.
i
should
add
in
all
fairness
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
earlier
rulings
commencing
in
1951,
were
not
formally
published
rules.
they
were
issued
to
individual
taxpayers,
but
they
were
widely
circulated
and
published
in
financial
and
tax
services
and
were
generally
known
to
the
public.
and
in
fact,
into
this
particular
record,
there
is
evidence
that
at
least
petitioner
gourielli
relied
on
the
ruling
that
he
had
read
about.
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
taxpayers
purchased
approximately
half
a
million
dollars
worth
of
bond.
mr.
gourielli
paid
117
and
a
half.
mr.
goldfarb
paid
110
on
the
average.
in
both
cases,
the
bonds
were
callable
at
a
general
call
price
on
30
days
notice
at
approximately
105.
and
in
both
cases,
the
bonds
were
also
callable
at
a
special
call
price
out
of
certain
sinking
funds
which
the
issuer
was
required
to
maintain
and
which
i
will
deal
with
it
in
some
detail
later
at
102.
the
government
conceives
that
the
taxpayers
were
entitled
to
deduct
the
difference
between
what
they
paid
in
mr.
gourielli's
case
117
and
in
mr.
goldfarb's
case
approximately
110,
and
the
general
call
price
105
in
the
year
in
question.
the
government,
however,
denies
the
further
right
of
the
taxpayer
to
deduct
down
to
the
special
call
price
which
in
one
case
was
102
and
the
other
case
approximately
101.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
in
either
case
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
--
mr.
justice
stewart
in
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
either
case.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
the
maturity
was
in
one
case
in
1983,
and
then
the
other
case
1981.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
a
particular
period
during
which
the
taxpayer
purchased
these
bonds,
the
economics
of
the
market
were
such,
the
interest
rate
being
above
the
current
rate
--
current
rate
being
paid
on
these
bonds.
that
these
bonds
were
not
likely
to
be
called
at
either
the
general
call
price
or
the
special
call
price.
the
second
circuit
and
the
tax
court
before
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
in
the
case
of
the
general
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
--
call
price,
the
interest
rate
being
larger.
it
was
unlikely
that
the
companies,
the
issuers,
would
refinance
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
--
the
issue.
in
the
case
of
the
sinking
funds
which
were
required
to
be
created
either
out
of
annual
deposits
of
1%
of
the
face
amount
or
out
of
property
additions,
both
companies
were
expanding.
and
it
was
it
--
during
the
period
of
an
expanding
economy
and
their
cash
could
be
used
to
much
more
profitability
in
the
expansion
of
their
current
operation
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
correct.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
the
fact
is
that
in
the
tax
year
in
question
accept
for
a
rather
--
rather
modest
amount
of
some
$184
in
the
appellation
issue
which
was
involved
in
the
gourielli
case,
there
was
no
cash
in
the
sinking
fund.
before
i
proceed
to
the
details
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
two
elements
which
i
think
are
rather
important
in
this
case.
the
real
issue
is,
what
was
the
law
in
1953
when
these
transactions
took
place,
and
not
as
the
respondent
has
consistently
tried
to
make
it.
what
the
law
should
have
been
in
1953.
it
may
well
be
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
these
bonds
were
purchased
in
1953
more
than
30
days
prior
to
the
end
of
the
year.
and
if
the
taxpayers
are
entitled
to
a
deduction
with
respect
to
the
special
call
on
in
deep
the
general
call
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
they
were
entitled
to
in
that
year.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
the
government
concedes
that
we
were
entitled
to
deduct
the
difference
between
what
was
paid
in
the
general
call
price.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
what
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
that
is
correct.
it
may
well
be
mr.
justice
stewart
that
if
this
case
were
being
considered
de
novo,
congress
might
have
well
legislative
differently
and
precluded
the
call
--
the
deduction
both
with
respect
to
the
general
call
and
the
special
call.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
it
has
indeed.
in
1954,
it
narrowed
the
permissible
deduction
for
bond
premium,
and
in
1958,
it
foreclosed
it
completely
except
with
respect
to
the
right
to
amortize
over
the
period
to
maturity
or
to
the
earlier
call
date
if
that
produced
the
lesser
deduction.
the
second
thing
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
sham
transaction.
there
isn't
the
slightest
suggestion
in
this
record
that
the
taxpayer's
purchases
of
the
bonds
were
not
bona
fide
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
no,
but
i
think
this
is
important
mr.
justice
brennan
to
know
that
aside
from
the
--
my
second
point
which
i
was
coming
to
is
that
the
special
call
provisions
that
were
included
in
these
bonds
were
not
tax
gimmicks.
they
were
not
put
in
by
issuers
for
the
purpose
of
stimulating
the
sale
of
their
bonds
because
of
the
tax
advantages.
they
were
put
in
and
that's
been
in
bond
issues
long
before
this
taxable
year.
indeed,
back
in
1942
when
congress
first
dealt
with
the
problem,
one
of
the
witnesses
testified.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
precisely.
no,
we
don't
but
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
the
vice
that
this
taxpayer
is
charged
with
is
that
he
took
advantage
of
what
he
considered
to
be
the
clear
mandate
of
the
statute
in
the
regulations
of
the
commissioner
to
convert
ordinary
income
into
capital
gain.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
in
that
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
special
call
price.
although
in
the
particular
year
that
he
did
it,
the
government
said
he
could
do
it
even
to
the
special
call
price
and
there
was
no
place
that
he
could
have
gone
in
that
year
to
have
gotten
a
different
answer.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
these
were
widely
circulated.
they
were
known.
and
the
fact
is
that
if
this
particular
taxpayer
had
seen
fit
to
ask
for
a
ruling,
he
would
have
gotten
precisely
that
answer.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
the
citation
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
don't
believe
it
is.
our
citation
is
one
of
the
tax
services
(voice

--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
--
only
one
i
know.
section
125
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
under
which
these
taxpayer
--
these
taxpayers
claim
their
right
of
deduction,
provides
that
the
amount
of
the
bond
premium
which
shall
be
deducted,
quote,
"shall
be
determined
with
reference
to
the
amount
of
the
basis
of
such
fund
and
with
reference
to
the
amount
payable
on
maturity
or
on
earlier
call
date."
we
believe
that
the
statute
means
what
it
says.
it
says,
"earlier
call
date."
these
bonds
were
callable
on
30
days
notice,
both
of
the
general
and
the
special
call.
and
we
believe
that
the
taxpayer
was
entitled
to
choose
either
under
regulations
of
the
commissioner
which
gave
him
that
privilege.
we
believe
that
the
amount
payable
as
we
argued
in
our
brief,
main
brief
in
this
court
means
the
amount
payable
at
the
special
call
price.
respondent,
however,
has
pursued
a
rather
peripatetic
course
as
to
how
this
case
should
be
approached.
in
the
lower
courts,
he
contended
that
what
was
needed
was
a
realistic
premium
that
the
amount
payable
was
not
realistic.
the
special
call
price
was
not
realistic.
and
therefore,
should
not
be
taken
into
account.
he
contended
that
there
was
no
likelihood
of
redemption
at
the
special
call
price,
and
therefore
the
special
call
price
should
not
be
used.
apparently,
the
respondent
had
second
thought,
although
he
won
this
particular
case
in
the
lower
courts.
and
he
now
admits
that
the
issue
of
likelihood
is
immaterial
or
at
least
he
says
he
does.
he
concedes
that
just
as
economic
likelihood
has
no
bearing
on
the
right
of
the
taxpayer
to
use
the
general
call
price
so
it
has
no
bearing
on
the
right
of
the
taxpayer
to
use
the
special
call
price.
he
does
suggest
rather
wistful
--
wistfully
that
maybe
the
right
to
amortize
down
to
the
general
call
price
was
the
wrong
rule
but
he
also
concedes
that
it
is
too
late
in
the
game
to
change
that
rule.
what
he
now
says
is
that
the
legal
probabilities
must
be
such
that
the
issuer
can
call
all
of
the
bonds
of
the
particular
issue
at
the
special
call
price
at
the
special
call
date.
what
he
is
really
doing
if
i
understand
it
correctly
is
to
say
that
the
phrase
"earlier
call
date"
in
section
125
means
unconditional
and
unlimited
earlier
call
date.
he
admits
that
the
likelihood
of
redemption
is
immaterial
but
he
says
that,
"in
the
case
of
the
general
call
price,
the
taxpayer
may
use
this
price
because
the
issuer
is
legally
entitled
to
call
the
entire
bond
issue
and
therefore,
taxpayer's
particular
bonds
at
anytime
on
30
days
notice."
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
the
issuer
was
required
either
through
cash
or
through
property
editions
to
deposit
1%
of
the
face
amount
of
the
bonds
in
the
--
in
the
appalachian
power
and
light,
this
was
1%
of
17
million
in
the
arkansas
power
&
light,
it
was
1
%
of
18
million,
each
year
or
in
lieu
thereof
property
additions.
however,
the
issuer
was
also
entitled
to
have
used
out
of
the
sinking
fund,
the
proceeds
of
the
takings
by
eminent
domain,
the
proceeds
of
destroyed
property
that
was
not
replaced
and
the
insurance
proceeds
that
came
in,
the
proceeds
of
released
property
that
were
released
from
the
land
of
the
indenture
and
so
in
accordance
with
permission
that
was
granted
in
the
indenture.
in
other
words,
there
were
many
sources
of
funds
which
might
have
found
themselves
in
the
sinking
fund
and
which
could
have
been
used
to
redeem
the
bonds
at
the
special
call
price.
in
fact,
the
respondent
in
its
brief,
i
think
is
a
bit
unfair
because
it
makes
the
--
he
makes
the
point
that
the
chance
of
the
taxpayers
bonds
in
this
case
being
redeemed
in
particular
year
were
one
out
of
a
hundred.
now,
this
might
or
might
not
have
been
true.
in
the
first
place,
in
the
case
of
bonds
that
were
issued
say
10
years
previously,
the
issuer
might
have
deposited
the
1%
each
year
for
10
years
before
he
decided
to
use
the
money
to
redeem
many
funds.
he
did
not
have
to
use
them
in
a
particular
year
that
the
deposit
was
made.
in
which
event,
the
chance
of
a
particular
issue
--
taxpayers'
bonds
being
redeemed
could
have
been
one
out
of
ten
or
after
20
years,
one
out
of
five,
or
if
some
of
this
property
had
been
destroyed
and
not
replaced,
the
proceeds
of
insurance
might
have
provided
the
possibility
of
all
of
the
taxpayers
bonds
being
redeemed.
in
other
words,
what
the
respondent
seems
to
say
is
that
because
there
was
no
legal
right
to
redeem
all
of
the
taxpayers'
bonds
at
the
special
call
price,
no
unconditional
and
unqualified
right
this
price
could
not
be
used.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
judge
friendly's
rationale
seems
to
be
that
on
the
question
of
realism,
there
was
no
realistic
possibility.
in
other
words,
the
respondent's
rule
is,
it's
either
100%
or
nothing.
i
have
already
pointed
out,
however,
that
there
were
other
possibilities
which
could
have
produced
enough
funds
to
have
increased
the
chances
of
res
--
of
taxpayers'
bonds
being
redeemed
to
far
more
than
one
out
of
100.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
precisely
because
whether
you
talk
about
the
economic
possibilities
or
the
legal
probabilities
as
the
respondent
would
talk
about.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
and
he
uses
the
words
contingent
and
limited.
what
you
come
down
to
mr.
justice
stewart
is
the
issue
of
likelihood
and
you
can't
run
away
from
the
decision,
the
bond
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.

is
an

under
the
statute
as
particularly
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
the
korell
case.
respondent
tried
to
narrow
the
interpretation
of
section
125
in
1950,
and
came
to
this
court
in
korell
against
the
commission.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
had
bought
american
telephone
and
telegraph
convertible
bonds
at
121
which
were
redeemable
on
30
days
notice
in
104
and
with
respect
to
which
the
taxpayer
had
the
right
to
convert
it
by
the
--
into
stock
by
the
payment
of
$40
a
share.
interestingly
enough
to
market
for
the
stock
at
that
point
was
61,
so
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
premium
that
was
being
paid
for
these
bonds
was
not
premium
in
the
sense
of
a
cost
for
payment
for
higher
rate
of
interest
which
was
being
paid
on
the
bond,
but
rather
it
was
being
paid
for
the
convertibility
feature.
and
this
--
the
respondent
came
to
this
court
and
urged
that
what
congress
meant
in
the
statute
when
it
used
the
phrase
"bond
premium"
was
through
bond
premium,
and
this
court
categorically
rejected
the
respondent's
contention.
the
court
held
that
congress
was
legislating
for
the
generality
of
the
case
and
that
a
separate
analysis
of
each
case
would
lead
to
narrow
--
to
use
the
court's
language,
"to
narrow
and
quite
possibly
unfair
distinction
between
varying
bond
issues
without
warrant
in
the
general
language
employed
or
in
the
legislative
history."
also,
the
court
said
that,
"if
there
was
a
loophole,
the
amendment
must
obviously
be
enacted
by
congress
and
not
by
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
or
this
court."
respondent
made
a
great
deal
in
that
case
of
the
fact
of
revenue
loss
which
might
be
produced
by
giving
the
taxpayer
the
benefit
of
the
bond
premium,
deduction,
just
as
he
has
adverted
to
this
--
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
the
language
which
this
court
used
in
the
korell
case
might
appropriately
be
referred
to
at
this
point.
the
court
stated,
"we
cannot
reject
the
clear
and
precise
avenue
of
expression,
actually
adopted
by
the
congress,
because
in
a
particular
case,
we
may
know
that
the
public
revenues
would
be
maximized
by
adopting
another
statutory
approach."
the
interesting
thing
to
me
about
the
korell
case
as
applied
to
this
case,
is
this,
respondent
would
deny
the
taxpayer,
the
right
to
take
the
amortization
down
to
the
special
call
price
in
this
case.
although
there
was
admittedly
a
possibility
that
he
might
be
deprived
in
the
taxable
year
of
his
premium,
admittedly
perhaps
an
unreal
possibility
or
an
unlikely
one
that
we
said.
but
this
court
permitted
the
taxpayer
to
take
the
premium
in
the
korell
case,
although
there
was
absolutely
no
way
that
the
issue
where
could
have
deprive
the
taxpayer
of
the
premium
which
he
paid
in
that
case,
or
of
the
tax
benefit
that
he
achieved.
because,
under
the
terms
of
the
bond
issue
in
the
korell
case,
if
the
bonds
were
called,
the
taxpayer
had
the
right
between
the
date
of
the
call
and
the
actual
date
of
con
--
con
--
of
redemption
to
convert
into
stock
and
thereby
fully
protect
his
premium.
in
other
words,
there
was
absolutely
no
possibility
in
the
korell
case
that
the
premium
which
the
taxpayer
paid
and
which
this
court
said
he
was
entitled
to
deduct
in
120
--
under
125
could
have
been
taken
away
from
him.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
must
say
that
it
took
me
a
fair
amount
of
time
to
understand
judge
friendly's
distinction.
his
only
comment
was
--
as
i
recall
that
the
korell
case
--
in
the
korell
case,
we
were
dealing
with
the
minuend
and
not
with
the
subtrahend.
i
think
the
language
was
quite
as
clear
--
is
quite
as
clear
in
129
as
to
the
meaning
of
bond
premium
which
is
the
minuend
in
judge
friendly's
definition.
and
the
meaning
either
of
amount
payable
or
earlier
call
date
which
would
be
the
subtrahend
in
judge
friendly's
term.
so
that
i
simply
don't
agree
with
his
distinction.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
i
thought
he
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
either
your
honor.
if
there
is
need
for
interpretation,
i
would
like
to
remind
this
court
that
the
legislative
history
bears
out.
that
congress
was
on
notice
as
early
as
1942,
that
the
special
call
prices
were
used.
respondent
gives
the
testimony
of
mr.
osgood
of
the
finance
committee
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
before
the
senate
finance
committee
in
1942,
the
back
of
his
hand.
but
i
would
remind
this
court
that
if
in
1950
in
deciding
the
korell
case
thought
that
mr.
osgood
was
deserving
of
better
treatment,
because
it
cited
mr.
osgood
itself
as
evidence
of
the
legislative
history.
furthermore,
in
1954,
congress
was
on
notice
of
the
special
call
provisions.
and
indeed
in
beginning
to
narrow
the
gap
or
to
close
the
door,
referred
to
the
fact
that
section
125
permitted
the
deduction
of
bond
premium
in
the
case
where
the
call
features
were
"nominal
or
inoperative."
what
could
be
more
descriptive
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here
--
than
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
thus
congress
did
not
do
anything
about
it
in
1942,
did
not
do
anything
about
it
in
1954
when
it
had
the
chance
and
it
was
not
until
1958
when
congress
finally
closed
the
door
completely
that
the
privilege
which
taxpayers
seeks
in
this
case
was
eliminated.
there's
an
interesting
contrast
between
congress'
action
and
the
respondent's
action
in
terms
of
retroactivity.
congress
in
narrowing
the
gap
or
commencing
to
narrow
the
gap
both
in
1954
and
1958
very
carefully
made
their
actions
prospective
only
to
prevent
in
their
terms
unfair
retroactive
application
to
previous
investment.
this
is
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
position
of
the
respondent,
who
refers
to
the
previous
rulings
as
being
inoperative
because
my
client
or
our
clients
did
not
rely
on
that.
respondent
misunderstands
the
thrust
of
our
argument.
we
are
not
saying
that
our
taxpayers
are
entitled
to
rely
on
these
prior
rulings
in
and
of
themselves.
but
we
do
say
that
if
the
interpretation
of
section
125
is
necessary,
there
is
no
better
evidence
of
what
a
reasonable
interpretation
would
be
then
respondent's
own
interpretation
during
the
tax
year
in
question.
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
terms
of
specifics
that
respondent
is
playing
fast
and
loose
on
its
retroactivity.
as
our
brief
show,
as
our
main
brief
and
our
reply
brief,
there
have
been
five
other
cases
before
the
courts
in
which
the
special
call
price
was
used.
now,
it
is
true
that
in
those
cases
respondent's
main
thrust
was
to
deny
the
amortization
deduction
completely.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
if
--
as
it
subsequently
turned
out,
respondent
was
unsuccessful
in
designing
all
amortization.
the
issue
of
the
special
call
price
against
the
general
call
price
would
have
become
absolutely
critical
and
yet
not
once
in
those
five
cases
did
respondent
choose
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
special
call
price.
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
that
were
three
courts
in
the
first
--
the
three
cases
in
the
first
circuit
your
honor,
maysteel
was
--
i
believe
fabreeka
products,
friedman
and
sherman
were
in
the
first
circuit,
gallun
was
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
--
decided
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
maysteel,
i'm
sorry
to
say
i
forgotten
which
circuit
--
mr.
theodore
tannenwald,
jr.
all
circuit
court
of
appeals
case.
maysteel
was
seventh
as
well.
in
summary
then,
before
i
go
to
summary,
if
i
may,
there
is
one
point
adverted
to
in
our
brief
which
--
in
which
we
make
the
point
that
if
respondent
--
that
under
respondent's
regulations,
the
taxpayer
was
required
to
choose
the
call
date
at
the
beginning.
and
if
he
--
once
he
chose
one,
he
had
to
stick
with
it.
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
informed
me
just
before
this
argument
last
evening
that
they
will
point
out
or
point
out
in
oral
argument
to
a
ruling
which
provides
that
this
is
not
true
and
interprets
this
regulation
without
belaboring
the
point
because
i
do
not
consider
that
it
is
particularly
essential
to
our
argument.
let
me
remind
the
court
that
the
ruling
to
which
the
solicitor
general
representative
will
refer
to
is
a
ruling
that
deals
not
with
two
call
prices
that
were
simultaneously
available,
but
to
--
but
a
serious
of
call
prices.
in
other
words
the
right
to
redeem
in
the
first
year,
let's
say
the
109,
in
the
second
year
at
108,
the
third
year
at
107.
so
your
honors
by
way
of
summary,
i
come
back
for
the
simple
nubbin
of
this
case.
the
respondent
in
the
courts
below
decided
these
--
these
cases
on
what
they
would
have
like
the
law
to
have
been,
not
on
what
the
statute
said.
i
openly
admit
that
my
clients
received
the
tax
benefit.
they
converted
all
the
ordinary
income
through
a
deduction
into
capital
gain
by
holding
and
selling
the
bond.
but
this
is
what
the
owners
of
real
estate
do
by
taking
depreciation.
this
is
the
consequence
of
the
capital
gain
structure.
and
i
don't
believe
that
it's
my
function
or
the
function
of
respondent
to
argue
the
policy
of
whether
capital
gains
are
good
or
bad
as
a
matter
policy.
our
point
is
that
the
same
problems
of
likelihood
with
respect
to
the
special
call
existed
in
a
different
form
with
respect
to
the
general
call.
the
general
call,
it
depended
upon
the
like
--
the
economics
of
the
interest
market.
in
the
special
call
case,
it
depended
upon
the
likelihood
of
certain
other
events.
our
point
is
that
as
the
--
this
court
said
in
the
korell
case,
and
as
we
believe
congress
said
in
the
statute
likelihood
is
immaterial,
and
the
congress
was
legislating
for
the
generality
of
the
case.
and
i
see
no
point
your
honors
as
to
why
this
court
should
narrow
the
doctrine
of
the
korell
case
and
go
back
from
where
it
was
in
1950
and
where
congress
said
it
should
be
particularly
in
a
case
where
the
respondent
is
trying
to
apply
its
rules
retroactively
and
changing
the
signals
in
the
middle
of
the
stream.
thank
you
very
much.
