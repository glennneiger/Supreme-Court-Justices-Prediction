there
was
a
privilege
of
call
in
30
days
notice
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
either
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
maturity
on
the
other
hand
was
several
years
away.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
because
to
refinance
would
have
cost
more
money
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
issue
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
the
retirement
of
their
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
their
indebtedness.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
government
does
concede
a
good
deal
of
your
case
actually,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
bonds
were
purchased
within
30
days
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
there
was
--
these
were
callable
on
30
days
notice.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
subsequently
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
government
said
to
many
other
taxpayers
that
they
could
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
basic
argument
is,
that
does
make
any
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
that
is
an
issue
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
properly
to
be
considered
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
this
law.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
--
they
do
reach
the
tax
services
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
--
i'm
talking
about
the
cca's
in
the
prentice
hall
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
practitioners
of
--
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--bill
of
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
could
i
return
mr.
pollak
just
a
moment
to
the
chief
justice's
question
to
you
about
few
minutes
ago.
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
the
only
fair
answer
to
his
question
as
to
whether
--
if
these
taxpayer
had
asked
for
a
ruling
in
1953,
all
the
evidences
that
he
would
have
gotten
to
the
ruling
that
he
could
have
amortized
to
the
special
call
price,
because
every
other
taxpayer
who
did
ask
for
one
up
to
and
including
that
time
did
get
such
a
--
such
letter.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
am
i
right
factually
that
every
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
1954
or
later
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
means
the
other
taxpayers
in
the
same
year
got
--
got
this
in
tax
advantage,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
other
taxpayers
in
the
same
calendar
taxable
year?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
for
one
don't
want
to
tell
you
because
the
really
important
part
of
this
case
is
not
this
part
but
it's
what
the
statute
of
regulations
mean,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
absent
the
special
call
price,
you
don't
question
the
absolute
legality
of
all
of
these,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
the
year
1953.
justice
potter
stewart
i
say
absent
the
question
of
a
special
call
price.
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
--
what's
the
point
of
all
this?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
--
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
we're
talking
now
about
different
call
price,
not
different
call
dates
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
this
case,
aren't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
in
certain
other
funds?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
at
a
different
price.
justice
potter
stewart
but
each
on
30
days
notice?
