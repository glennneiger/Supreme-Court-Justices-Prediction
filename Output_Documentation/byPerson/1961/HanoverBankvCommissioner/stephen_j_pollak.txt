mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
let
me
answer
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan
the
evans
case,
the
third
circuit
case
was
reported
in
295
f.2d
713.
the
government
does
not
come
to
this
court,
this
morning
asking
for
a
decision
because
of
policy
or
tax
avoidance.
there
is
a
statute
under
which
this
30-day
tax
benefit
bonds,
and
that's
the
petitioner's
word
for
the
bonds,
were
sought
to
be
used
to
convert
a
capital
gain
into
a
much
more
valuable
ordinary
income
deduction.
and
it
is
that
statute,
section
125
of
the
code
which
is
to
be
interpreted.
we
suggest
that
the
answer
to
petitioner's
argument,
that
congress
didn't
do
anything
in
1942
and
in
1954,
because
congress
didn't
need
to
do
anything,
amortization
because
of
a
special
call
right,
because
of
a
right
to
redeem
a
fraction
of
the
bonds
was
never
permitted
by
this
statute.
and
it
need
not
--
congress
need
not
have
rewritten
the
statute
to
meet
a
problem
which
did
not
exist.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
was
not
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
commissioner.
the
petitioners
have
mentioned
this
morning
and
of
course
in
the
lower
courts
that
there
were
so-called
private
rulings
in
which
the
commissioner
approved
the
amortization
to
a
special
call
date.
i
might
say
that
the
argument
is
made
in
terms
of
a
virtual
blizzard
of
these
rulings
and
our
search
in
which
we
endeavour
to
be
diligent
has
disclosed
what
i
would
call
a
few
errant
snowflakes.
these
rulings
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
those
snowflakes
did
not
reach
congress
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
those
--
i
hate
to
keep
calling
them
snowflakes
but
they're
labeled
with
it
now.
they
reached
the
tax
service
to
our
knowledge
or
to
my
knowledge
in
one
instance
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
--
that's
right
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
subsequent
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
to
the
transactions
in
issue
here.
one
private
ruling
reached
the
tax
service
involving
the
elizabeth
river
tunnel
bonds,
i
believe
in
norfolk.
those
were
tax
exempt
bonds
that
--
that's
somewhat
different
than
the
taxable
bonds
here
in
issue.
but
that
ruling
reached
the
tax
services
and
as
i
say
after
the
transactions
in
issue.
but
i
would
like
to
state
the
specific
facts
of
the
administrative
history
as
we
understand
it.
in
december
of
1952,
the
commissioner
issued
a
private
ruling
approving
the
amortization
to
the
special
call
date.
he
issued
one
further
private
ruling
prior
to
the
transactions
and
issue.
thereafter,
we
know
of
two
more
private
rulings,
and
in
september
of
1954,
the
commissioner
have
denied
amortization
to
the
special
call
date
and
it
was
establishing
a
corrective
process
which
led
to
the
first
published
revenue
ruling
that
there
ever
was
on
this
question.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
as
--
as
i
understand,
the
practice
permits
taxpayers
to
request
an
opinion
from
the
rulings
branch
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
the
taxpayer
sets
forth
the
facts
of
a
taxable
transaction
in
which
the
taxpayer
proposes
to
engage
and
ask
what
the
tax
consequences
will
be.
it
has
been
the
practice
for
some
years
to
issue
private
rulings
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
then
i
do
not
want
to
use
the
word
"issue".
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
these
private
rulings
or
if
i
might
say
that
--
they
are
private.
they
are
meant
to
be
good
for
the
taxpayer
who
requests
them.
the
regulations
provide
that
they
will
not
be
binding
on
the
commissioner
or
--
or
pertain
to
other
taxpayers
than
the
taxpayer
to
whom
the
private
ruling
is
issued.
the
--
this
is
a
well-known
fact
in
the
tax
practice
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
your
honor,
i
know
that
they
are,
at
least
in
this
case,
there
was
this
ruling
published
and
i'm
sure
that
the
capable
tax
services
keep
up
with
the
internal
revenue
service's
views.
but
i
want
to
state
that
the
--
this
tax
ruling
that
was
issue,
it
was
part
of
a
yearly
total
of
some
40,000
private
letters.
and
rather
than
use
the
word
issue,
i
really
would
like
to
say
write
a
letter.
there
are
40,000
of
those
letters
issued
written
a
year,
in
order
to
carry
that
practice
which
is
engaged
in
to
be
helpful
to
taxpayers.
the
authority
to
write
those
letters
must
be
delegated
the
lowest
possible
level
in
the
service.
and
it
is
only
when
the
commissioner's
office
issues
what
they
refer
to
as
a
published
revenue
ruling
that
the
rule
is
meant
to
have
general
applicability.
there
are
some
500
to
700
published
revenue
rulings
a
year.
these
are
reviewed
thoroughly
and
meant
to
have
general
applicability.
a
private
written
letter
is
not
a
general
rule.
it
is
not
meant
to
be
a
general
rule,
and
when
relied
upon,
these
petitioners
had
advice
when
relied
upon
the
advise
is
chargeable
i
submit
with
knowledge
that
those
are
private
letters.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice
the
--
i
think
that
is
in
part
of
function
of
the
number
of
requests
for
these
rulings.
the
tax
people
in
the
rulings
branch,
if
they
received
two,
made
an
interpretation
of
the
law
as
they
understood
it.
if
i
submit,
they
received
20
or
more,
i
submit
they
would
boost
the
question
to
a
higher
level
which
it
was
submitted
to
in
the
september
1954
instance
in
which
event,
the
chief
counsel's
office
for
the
first
time
met
the
question
and
that
that
instance
saw
the
mistake
and
set
the
corrective
process
in
motion.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
know
in
any
particular
instance
whether
the
chief
justice
sees
a
private
ruling
--
pardon
me
the
chief
counsel.
i
know
that
in
this
instance,
the
chief
counsel
first
saw
one
of
these
private
ruling
requests.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
they
are
signed
by
sometimes
the
chief
of
the
rulings
branch,
by
somebody
or
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
let
--
let
me
answer
the
second
part
of
your
question
sir,
the
regulations
and
published
revenue
rulings
which
established
the
procedures
for
these
private
ruling
letters,
state
that
the
taxpayer
who
obtains
a
private
ruling
may
rely
on
that
ruling
if
he
has
correctly
stated
the
facts.
the
litigation
which
would
stem
from
a
judgment
that
there
was
a
mistake
on
the
law
which
was
the
judgment
in
this
case
will
be
as
to
other
taxpayers
who
obtained
no
private
rulings.
i
want
to
mention
or
go
back
to
the
statute
which
is
being
interpreted.
it
was
enacted
in
1942
and
provided
the
taxpayers
who
purchased
these
bonds
at
a
premium
may
deduct
so
much
of
that
premium
as
qualifies
as
an
amortizable
bond
premium.
there's
a
established
a
three
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
--
i
can't
--
i
can't
say
that
he
would
have
gotten
that
ruling.
i
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
you
are
right
factually
and
that
i
know
of
two
taxpayers
who
requested
such
rulings
and
obtained,
yes.
they
obtained
private
letters
authorizing
the
deduction.
the
case
in
which
the
issue
was
presented
to
the
chief
counsel
involved
the
same
time
period
of
a
purchase
of
bonds
as
is
present
here.
i
don't
suppose
that's
surprising
since
the
tax
returns
of
the
year
1953
were
questioned
and
the
deduction
which
was
permitted
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
a
deduction
which
was
permitted
by
the
private
ruling
letter
was
found
to
be
a
mistake
of
law.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
precisely.
this
petitioner
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
taxpayers
are
chargeable
with
knowledge
of
the
opportunity
to
obtain
private
rulings
which
in
their
private
cases
will
be
afforded
to
binding
effect
if
the
facts
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
and
other
circumstances.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
statute.
it
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
taxpayers
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
know
that
taxpayers
in
the
year
1953
had
their
returns
questioned,
because
these
are
taxpayers
in
that
year
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
know
that
the
taxpayers
who
in
1952
and
in
october
1953
got
private
letters.
i
know
no
reason
to
think
that
they
did
not
obtain
the
very
deduction
which
we
are
questioning
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
is
so.
the
statute
provides
a
three-step
process
for
the
determination
of
this
amortizable
bond
premium.
the
first
step
is
the
election
of
the
period
for
amortization
that
is
whether
to
maturity
or
if
the
indenture
provide
to
an
earlier
call
date.
once
the
election
of
the
period
is
made,
then
the
second
and
third
steps
follow
simply.
the
second
step
is
the
identification
of
the
price
payable
at
the
conclusion
of
the
period
selected
and
the
third
step
is
the
subtraction
of
that
price
from
the
price
paid
for
the
bond.
i
might
illustrate
just
quickly
with
a
simple
case
of
a
$100
face
value
bond
purchased
at
120
and
callable
at
105
on
30
days
notice.
the
first
step
would
be
the
taxpayers'
election
to
take
the
30-day
period
for
amortization
and
the
identification
that
the
bond
was
callable
at
the
end
of
30
days.
the
second
step
would
be
the
selection,
the
identification
of
the
price
payable
105
at
the
conclusion
of
the
30
days
period.
the
third
step
would
be
the
substraction
of
that
price
payable
from
the
cost
giving
a
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
just
--
i
thought
that
it
might
be
helpful
to
approach
in
that
way.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i'm
just
--
i
don't
mean
to
confuse
you.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
case
this
morning
is
concerned
with
the
identification
of
when
a
bond
is
subject
to
an
earlier
call
date.
for
the
statute
provides
that
the
premium
will
be
deducted
over
the
period
to
maturity
or
to
an
earlier
call
date.
the
question
is
what
rights
of
redemption
provided
in
the
indenture
with
respect
to
a
particular
bond
constitute
a
right
to
call
that
bond
and
thereby
establish
an
earlier
call
date
permitting
the
amortization
to
be
taken.
in
this
case,
the
rights
of
special
call
were
of
two
kinds.
first,
the
issuers
retain
the
right
to
use
funds
in
the
sinking
fund
to
purchase
bonds
in
30
days
notice
at
the
special
call
price.
the
right
to
place
money
in
the
sinking
fund
was
severely
limited
to
1%
of
the
outstanding
bonds,
thus
1%
over
a
year
period.
thus
the
right
to
purchase
funds
at
the
special
price,
was
a
right
to
purchase
1%
of
the
outstanding
issue
drawn
by
lot
each
year
that
is
the
most
that
was
afforded
under
that
sinking
fund
redemption
provision.
the
second
right
was
a
right
to
use
funds
on
deposit
in
three
property
funds.
and
i
would
like
to
pass
quickly
over
that
although
i
will
take
time
if
it's
necessary
the
right
to
put
money
in
the
three
property
fund
was
a
contingent
right.
it
arose
only
if
property
was
taken
by
eminent
domain,
if
property
was
released
formally
from
the
indenture
or
if
property
was
destroyed
by
a
casualty.
this
right
to
use
funds
and
the
property
fund
did
not
come
into
being
until
one
of
those
contingencies
occurred.
now,
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
the
right
of
the
issuers
to
use
these
funds
to
purchase
1%
of
the
bonds
on
30
days
notice
at
the
special
call
price,
1%
drawn
by
lot
did
not
establish
for
the
entire
issue
for
all
the
bonds
an
earlier
call
date.
we
contend
that
when
the
statute
refers
to
earlier
call
date,
it
means
a
date
on
which
the
bond
is
callable.
that
the
right
of
the
issuer
to
call
1%
drawn
by
lot
doesn't
permit
a
man
who
purchases
100
bonds
to
amortize
the
premium
on
the
100
bonds
or
man
who
purchase
of
1000
or
10,000
just
because
the
issuer
if
it
elects
an
option,
and
we're
not
talking
probabilities.
we
faced
the
--
i
see
there
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
section
125
provides
for
an
amortizable
bond
premium
deduction
where
the
bond
is
subject
to
an
earlier
call
date.
this
is
meant
rich
dividens
for
high
bracket
taxpayers.
in
the
example
i
mentioned
before
the
recess
of
the
$100
bond
purchased
at
120
and
callable
on
30
days
at
105,
the
80%
tax
bracket
taxpayer
obtains
the
deduction
of
$15
worth
$12.
if
he
sells
the
bond
at
the
end
of
the
30-day
period,
which
he
used
for
amortization,
and
he
has
offsetting
short-term
capital
losses,
he
pays
a
tax
of
--
or
what
is
the
equivalent
of
$3.75,
thus
he
has
a
tax
profit
on
the
30-day
purchase
and
sale
of
$8.25.
but
of
course,
these
transactions
aren't
engaged
in
--
in
$100
amounts.
at
issue
in
this
case
are
two
different
taxpayers
each
of
whom
purchased
a
half
a
million
dollars
of
bonds.
the
limits
of
these
deductions
really
knew
no
bounds,
ingenuity
afforded
a
double
deduction,
where
taxpayers
purchased
bonds
subject
to
call
on
30
days
notice,
amortize
them
over
the
30-day
period,
and
then
gave
the
bonds
to
charity.
thus,
again
with
the
$100
bond
purchased
at
120,
callable
at
105,
a
taxpayer
would
borrow
all
but
the
$15
amount
of
the
premium.
he
would
hold
the
bond
30
days
and
deduct
the
amortizable
bond
premium
of
$15.
then,
he
would
give
the
bond
subject
to
indebtedness
to
charity
and
receive
another
deduction
for
his
equity
or
for
$15,
so
he'd
get
on
the
30-day
purchase
and
contribution
to
charity,
he
would
get
$30
of
deduction
worth
to
the
80%
bracket
taxpayer
$24.
of
course,
he'd
also
get
the
reward
of
feeling
that
he
made
the
contribution
to
charity.
one
of
the
cases
in
the
courts,
evans
involved
the
purchase
of
$2
million
face
amount
of
bonds
at
a
premium
of
$200,000.
the
bonds
were
subject
to
call
on
the
30
days.
the
taxpayer
invested
$118,000
of
his
money,
borrowed
the
rest.
he
took
the
amortizable
bond
premium
deduction,
gave
the
bonds
to
charity
and
came
out
with
some
$200,000
or
a
little
bit
over
of
deductions
for
an
investment,
an
out
of
pocket
investment
of
$118,000.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
--
we
do
not
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
do
not
question
the
legality
of
the
amortization
to
the
general
call
date
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
point
of
this
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
petitioners
attempt
to
make
these
devices
for
deductions
available
were
bonds
are,
in
our
judgment
not
subject
to
call.
we
contend
that
the
commissioner
or
the
facts
and
history
show
that
the
commissioner
accepted
deduction
to
the
general
call
date
because
all
bonds
were
subject
to
call
because
for
each
bond,
there
was
an
ascertainable
date
where
the
issuer
had
the
right
to
call
the
bond.
what
petitioner
seeks
in
this
case
is
the
extension
of
this
right
of
deduction
to
a
case
where
bonds
are
not
subject
to
call.
and
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
justice
stewart
in
our
--
in
our
judgment,
the
price
only
becomes
pertinent
when
the
call
date
is
identified.
in
this
case,
the
bonds
were
subject
to
call
on
30
days
notice
at
a
general
call
price.
the
indenture
also
provides
that
the
issuer
could
use
funds
in
the
sinking
fund
if
any
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
in
certain
other
funds,
to
purchase
bonds
drawn
by
lot
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
on
30
days
notice
at
102.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
and
we
contend
that
the
issue
present
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
that
the
issue
presented
is
whether
the
rights
to
purchase
on
30
days
notice
at
the
special
call
price
where
a
right
to
purchase
at
an
earlier
call
date
in
being
as
to
identified
bonds.
whether
there
was
as
to
the
bonds
for
which
the
redemption
--
the
amortization
was
claimed
an
earlier
call
date.
i
--
i
started
to
make
the
point
that
the
government
is
not
contending
that
amortization
to
the
special
call
price
can
be
denied.
we
are
arguing
about
the
timing
of
this,
the
petitioner
seek
to
anticipate
as
to
all
their
bonds
a
special
call
because
the
issuer
has
a
right
to
redeem
each
year
1%
or
on
contingencies
some
others
and
take
that
deduction
in
30
days
after
purchase.
the
government's
position
is
that
where
there
is
no
--
that
there
is
no
earlier
call
date
provide
and
that
as
to
this
special
calls,
the
purchaser
funds
must
wait
until
there
is
an
actual
call
and
then
deduct
the
premium
over
the
30
days
following
the
actual
call.
the
premium
deduction
is
not
denied
once
an
actual
call
is
made.
we
contend
that
congress
did
not
afford
the
deduction
as
to
all
the
bonds
of
an
issue
every
30
days
merely
because
the
issuer
retain
the
right
to
call
1%.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
are
unusual
in
the
public
utility
industry.
these
were
bonds
issued
by
appalachian
and
arkansas
power
&
light.
they
have
them
and
i
seen
indentures
of
louisiana
and
several
others
that
also
had
a
special
call
provision
and
a
general
call
provision.
there
are
many
indentures
and
perhaps
doing
the
financial
policy
book
states
that
most
bond
indentures
do
not
provide
both
special
and
the
general
call.
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
the
other
way
for
the
public
utility
bonds.
the
words
of
the
statute
to
which
upon
the
final
analysis
this
question
comes,
provide
that
the
amount
of
the
bond
premium
shall
be
determine
with
reference
to
the
basis
of
such
bond.
and
with
reference
to
the
amount
payable
on
maturity
or
an
earlier
call
date.
they
are
expressed
--
congress
expressed
itself
in
the
singular,
not
in
the
plural
or
not
in
the
averages
or
not
in
the
probabilities.
we
contend
that
the
petitioners
are
required
to
establish
under
the
law
that
the
bond
for
which
they
claim
amortization
was
subject
to
call.
they
cannot
and
have
not
met
that
requirement.
they
cannot
show
as
to
any
bonds
on
which
they
claim
the
deduction
to
the
special
call
price
that
those
bonds
were
subject
to
call.
the
statute
further
provides
that
the
method
of
amortization
must
be
reasonable.
we
believe
that
judge
friendly
for
the
second
circuit
put
to
rest
once
and
for
all
the
petitioners'
contention
that
they
have
adopted
a
reasonable
method.
he
said,
"taxpayers
have
cited
no
authority",
and
i'm
quoting
that,
"it
is
sound
accounting
practice
to
provide
within
30
days
after
acquiring
a
bond
are
reserved
large
enough
to
meet
not
only
every
risk
of
call
that
could
eventuate
during
the
amortization
period
but
also
one
that
could
not."
we
believe
that
it
is
patently
unreasonable
to
claim
amortization
on
100,000
or
10,000
bonds
because
the
issuer
has
a
right
to
redeem
1%
of
them
drawn
by
lot
each
year.
the
statute
was
passed
to
remedy
and
inequity
in
the
prior
tax
law
where
taxpayers
who
purchased
bonds
at
a
premium
because
the
bonds
carried
a
higher
interest
rate
than
that
on
the
market,
were
required
to
recognize
the
full
interest
as
income.
they
were
not
able
to
amortize
the
premium
against
that
income
instead
they
were
afforded
in
artificial
capital
loss
on
sale.
of
course,
the
30-day
amortization
doesn't
have
any
relation
to
interest
income.
the
petitioners
don't
pay
the
higher
price
because
of
the
rate
of
interest.
they
don't
expect
interest
or
at
least
buy
them
for
that
purpose.
they
sell
them
after
30
days
and
at
most
received
of
small
amount
of
interest.
however,
the
argument
that
this
was
not
the
purpose
for
which
congress
enacted
the
statute
was
made
in
the
korell
case
was
not
successful
and
we
don't
rely
on
it
although
we
do
believe
in
it.
we
believe
that
the
30-day
amortization
does
not
serve
the
purpose
for
which
congress
enacted
the
law.
we
believe
conclusive,
however,
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
fact
that
congress
three
times
was
confronted
by
interpretations
of
the
law
going
beyond
the
sound
accounting
principles
which
led
to
its
passage
and
three
times
amended
the
statute.
in
fact,
after
the
korell
decision,
congress
was
so
certain
of
its
position
as
to
the
purpose
of
this
law
that
its
committee
within
10
days
had
issued
a
report
and
an
amended
version
of
the
law
which
amendment
was
enacted
some
two
months
later.
the
claims
of
these
petitioners
are,
we
believe,
unwarranted.
they
made
a
deduction
to
the
special
call
price
and
it
was
denied.
the
deductions
afforded
them
were
respectively
$64,000
and
$27,000
under
their
right
conceded
by
the
government
in
this
case
to
make
a
deduction
to
a
date
on
which
the
bond
was
callable,
the
general
call
date.
they
contend
that
they
are
entitled
to
more
respectively
$18,000
and
$20,000
because
their
bonds
were
subject
to
a
right
in
the
issuer
each
year
to
draw
by
lot
and
choose
1%.
we
contend
that
that
is
not
a
date
for
earlier
call
as
to
any
ascertainable
bond.
we
contend
that
the
deduction
claimed
is
unwarranted
under
the
statute
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
