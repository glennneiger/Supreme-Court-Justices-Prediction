it's
conceded
is
it,
common
ground
between
you
that
--
that
what
the
--
that
1953
is
the
decisive
year
for
determining
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
issuing
of
private
ruling
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
word
"issue"
bears
with
it
to
mean
more
than
ex
parte
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
undisclosed
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
legal
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
--
whether
you
should
or
shouldn't
depend
on
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
could
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
a
way
of
getting
out,
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
infer
that
to
chief
counsel
may
not
know
what
is
contained
in
these
40,000
letters?
i'm
just
interested
in
the
--
in
the
administrative
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
mental
process.
it
seems
to
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
infer
--
i
inferred
from
what
you
say
that
a
letter
may
be
written
today
and
when
it
does
get
to
the
chief
counsel's
office
on
review,
he
may
say
that's
all
wrong
and
bring
litigation
opposed
to
that
which
was
recommended
in
the
--
of
authorizing
a
letter,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
signed
these
things
(inaudible)
mr.
pollak?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
with
gregory
we'd
get
into
a
lot
of
trouble,
would
that
establishes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
your
--
is
your
--
is
the
implication
of
what
you
didn't
say
that
while
the
petitioner
may
have
availed
himself
of
this
procedure
getting
private
advice
which
is
binding
on
the
treasury,
on
the
gover
--
on
the
commissioner,
in
fact
he
didn't
so
therefore
we
reverted
back
to
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
what
i
think
the
statute
is
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
the
answer.
but
if
you
have
this
opportunity
of
getting
an
ad
hoc
ruling
which
is
controlling,
and
if
you
don't
avail
yourself
of
it,
that
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
under
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
mr.
tannenwald's
argument
doesn't
have
to
be
met
by
you.
but
when
we
go
to
the
statute,
the
construction
placed
upon
it
in
whatever
form
or
whatever
volume,
i'm
--
i
assure
you
that
it
was
very
relevant
as
to
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
that
they
might
have
got
this
controlling
private
information
by
the
mean
that
they
did
get
it.
