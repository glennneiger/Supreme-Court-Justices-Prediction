mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
again
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
transitory
act
creating
an
unseaworthy
condition
aboard
the
vessel
imposes
liability
for
consequentially
injuries
or
not.
on
march
13,
1957,
the
grelmarion
was
in
the
port
of
galveston
beginning
to
load
grain.
grain
was
loaded
by
a
means
of
a
spout
that
pour
the
grain
into
an
open
hatch.
when
the
hatch
had
enough
of
grain
up
to
and
to
a
cone
where
the
grain
would
have
spilled
over,
longshoremen
went
into
the
hatch
and
by
a
means
of
shovels
equalize
the
grain
all
over
the
hatch
so
the
hatch
would
be
filled
up.
the
grain
was
stored
at
a
granary
own
and
operated
by
the
city
of
galveston.
the
city
of
galveston
and
a
number
of
stevedoring
companies
have
experienced
at
least
since
1949,
at
least
four
instances
in
which
a
substantial
number
of
longshoremen
received
serious
injuries
because
the
grain
was
treated
with
certain
fumigants
was
not
properly
aerated
so
that
when
the
grain
got
into
the
hatch
and
the
men
worked
with
it,
they
became
ill.
the
one
case,
there
was
strive,
substantial
damages
were
allowed.
three
subsequent
cases
or
at
least
two
subsequent
cases
were
settled.
the
last
settlement
of
the
case
involving
some
70
years
old
longshoreman
took
place
on
1957.
when
that
vessel
came
in
into
the
port
of
galveston
for
the
first
day
and
a
half,
the
loading
operation
proceeded
in
its
usual
normal
course.
the
longshoremen
quit
at
noon
for
lunch
and
came
back
at
1
o'clock.
at
that
time
there
had
been
on
which
the
grain
was
been
poured
into
and
loaded
for
was
about
four
or
five
feet
from
the
overhead
bulk
hair
or
ceiling.
enough
grain
was
poured
in
there
at
that
time
so
that
the
longshoremen
had
to
go
into
the
hold
and
spread
out
which
shovels
the
grain.
after
they
were
in
there
for
a
while,
another
shot
of
grain
was
ordered
which
completely
cover
the
hatch
and
so
to
speak
bury
the
longshoremen
in
there.
that
shot
of
grain
was
claim
and
the
trial
court
found
to
have
been
contaminated
with
noxious
fumes
and
gases
and
immediately
thereafter,
the
longshoremen
became
ill.
there
had
to
be
so
to
speak
bury
there
from
under
and
they
came
on
dead.
they
immediately
became
ill
and
suffered
injuries.
suit
was
filed
against
the
vessel
owners
as
well
as
the
city
of
galveston.
as
to
the
vessel,
unseaworthiness
was
claimed
and
negligence
as
the
city
of
galveston,
negligence
on
failing
to
see
that
the
grain
is
free
and
clear
of
any
obnoxious
fumes
before
it
reaches
the
vessel.
after
the
trial
that
had
lasted
sometime,
the
trial
court
made
certain
findings
of
fact.
it
is
our
position
and
it
has
been
our
position
below
that
the
findings
of
fact
that
the
trial
court
has
made,
in
effect,
constitutes
a
finding
of
unseaworthiness
under
the
applicable
law.
it
was
our
position
that
the
trial
court
applied
the
doctrine
of
temporary
or
transitory
unseaworthiness,
which
prior
to
the
mitchell
case,
we
contended
was
not
a
proper
measure
of
judging
that
doctrine
and
subsequent
thereto,
of
course,
we
felt
the
same
way.
the
trial
court
made
these
important
findings.
finding
number
9
was
that
as
the
500
bushels
of
grain
were
poured
in
to
hat
--
into
the
hatch,
the
longshoremen
were
working
for
the
moment
in
an
area
completely
enclosed
without
access
to
outside
air.
this
was
not
an
unusual
incident.
finding
of
fact
number
10,
almost
immediately,
libellants
felt
ill
effects.
finding
of
fact
number
11,
the
illness
and
disabilities
that
resulted
from
the
noxious
fumes
and
gases
introduced
into
the
bin
when
the
last
shot
of
grain
which
was
loaded
after
1
p.m.and
that
such
fume
resulted
from
an
insecticide
applied
at
some
point
to
destroy
weevil
infestation.
findings
of
fact
number
19,
the
illness
resulted
from
the
fumigant
improperly
applied
and
adhere
to
the
grain
in
unreasonably
--
unseasonably
long
period
of
time.
these
are
the
findings
of
fact
the
court
has
made.
then
concludes
that
under
such
circumstances,
these
did
not
cause
the
gre
--
grelmarion
to
become
unseaworthy.
we
contended
and
contend
here
that
a
test
is
whether
the
area
aboard
the
vessel
where
the
longshoremen
are
required
to
work
was
reasonably
fit
to
do
that
work
with
safety.
if
it
is
not,
then
a
condition
of
unseaworthiness
exist
as
a
matter
of
law.
for
instance,
and
this
instance,
this
was
a
trial
before
a
jury,
the
court
on
the
special
interrogatories
could
have
asked
the
jury
whether
the
grain
was
contaminated
with
gas
fumes,
whether
that
condition
made
that
area
an
area
that
was
not
reasonably
safe
to
do
that
work.
if
in
such
condition
was
a
cause
of
harm
impart
of
the
resulting
illness
and
injuries
suffered
by
the
longshoremen,
that
in
effect
does
what
the
court
has
found
and
its
on
findings
of
fact.
the
appellate
court
recognized
this
point
and
said
as
follows,
“this
is
the
case
of
happening
when
the
last
batch
of
wheat
came
out
of
the
funnels,
instantaneously
rendering
unfit
quarters
which
until
then
had
been
and
when
the
funnels
cleared
away,
continued
to
be
entirely
seaworthy.”
the
question,
therefore,
is
whether
that
condition
rendered
the
area,
and
which
these
people
are
working,
not
a
reasonable
safe
place
to
work.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
long
before
the
mitchell
case,
such
circumstances
rendered
an
area
on
--
of
the
vessel
unseaworthy
and
dixon
versus
united
states,
judge
harlan,
i
believe,
was
the
judge
in
that
case,
held
unsatisfactory
working
conditions
held
to
be
within
the
seaworthiness
doctrine
although
the
vessel
itself
and
her
appliances
were
seaworthy.
the
defense
in
this
case
and
apparently
adapted
by
the
appellate
court
was
that
the
hatch
itself
and
the
bins,
the
bins
in
there,
were
a
nowise
was
defective.
and
therefore,
the
introduction
of
the
dangerous
substances
into
the
hatch
was
not
of
such
a
character
as
to
render
that
condition
a
condition
of
unseaworthiness.
we
submit
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
the
mitchell
case,
that
doctrine
is
unsound.
in
fact
judge
reeves
in
the
second
time
the
case
went
around
stated
so
in
his
dissent.
he
said
that
it
is
clear
that
temporarily
the
bin
where
the
libellants
were
working
was
not
a
reasonable
safe
place
in
which
to
work.
obviously,
if
it
was
not
a
reasonable
safe
place
in
which
to
work
and
if
that
condition
was
created
by
cargo
that
was
infested
with
obnoxious
fumes
and
gases
that
created
a
conditional
unseaworthiness
for
which
liability
applies
under
the
applicable
law,
the
question
that
particularly
rather
the
particularly
importance
here
is
whether
a
vessel
which
has
no
difficulty
whether
its
hatch
which
has
a
good
deck,
for
instance,
and
some
plane
party
comes
in
or
one
of
the
officers
of
the
vessel
or
anyone
else
creates
a
dangerous
condition
on
the
deck
as
it
happened
in
the
mitchell
case
and
injury
follows
that
under
the
applicable
laws,
we
now
have
it,
creates
an
unseaworthy
condition
for
which
liability
it
applies.
the
appellate
court
rested
its
decision,
i
believe,
on
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
concluded
that
under
these
facts,
unseaworthiness
did
not
take
place
and
holding
that
the
unseaworthy
condition
of
the
vessel
as
a
question
of
fact.
and
therefore,
they
would
not
under
the
mcallister
case
overturn
findings
of
fact
by
the
trial
court.
we
submit
that
in
the
--
under
the
facts
in
this
case
and
under
the
fact
finding
by
the
trial
court,
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
trial
court
is
repudiated
by
its
own
findings.
the
findings
clearly
set
out
a
dangerous
condition
facing
this
longshoremen
working
in
there.
there
was
nothing
that
these
longshoremen
could
possibly
do
to
extricate
themselves
from
the
situation
they
found
themselves
in
to
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
may
it
please
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
may
it
please
the
court.
assuming
that
there
is
not,
i
will
in
a
moment
show
that
there
was.
but
assuming
that
there
was
not,
still,
the
species
of
liability
without
fault
under
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine
applies.
but
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
well,
that
--
that's
alright.
it
--
not
necessarily
so
and
let
me
point
out
why.
let
us
assume
that
a
bad
drum
of
oil
began
leaking
because
of
some
reason
or
other
and
momentarily,
there
was
a
lot
of
oil
on
the
deck
and
someone
passes
by
and
slips
and
falls
and
receives
injuries,
they
--
nothing
they
could
do
about
it.
they
didn't
know
anything
about
it.
they
had
no
knowledge
of
the
situation.
since
foreseeability,
knowledge
is
--
are
no
elements
prerequisite
unseaworthiness,
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
a
liability.
but
let's
see
whether
they
could
have
done
something
about
it.
now,
the
court
will
recall
that
i've
stated
at
the
--
on
my
opening
remarks
that
there
were
at
least
three
other
incidents
of
somewhat
of
nature.
the
court
finds
that
the
steamship
company's
agents
had
knowledge
of
this
fact,
that
the
city
of
galveston
had
knowledge
of
these
facts.
the
evidence
shows
that
had
a
placed
a
person
to
test
the
grain
at
the
last
bin
before
they
went
into
the
spout
that
could
--
by
testing
it,
that
could
have
been
discovered
and
such
a
discovery
could
have
prevented
what
has
taken
place.
of
course
that
goes
to
the
question
in
my
opinion
to
negligence
and
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine.
but
i
submit
that
under
the
findings
of
the
court
that
even
negligence
exists
in
this
case.
and
while
i
know
that
the
trial
court's
findings
of
fact
supported
by
any
top
of
evidence
either
not
challengeable
in
any
appellate
court,
i
say
that
under
the
court's
findings
of
fact
in
this
case,
negligence
has
been
established
in
number
of
cases
holding
that
a
judge's
determination
of
negligence
as
distinguished
from
the
evidentially
facts
leading
to
it
is
a
conclusion
of
law,
freely
review
of
the
long
appeal.
and
it's
not
a
finding
of
fact
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
unless
clearly
o'neal's
doctrine.
and
i
say
first
as
to
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine,
the
trial
court's
findings
of
--
of
fact
that
a
vessel
was
not
unseaworthy
is
contrary
not
only
to
its
own
findings
of
fact
but
under
this
particular
circumstances,
it's
a
conclusion
of
law
which
is
freely
reviewable
by
this
court.
libellants
and
the
petitioners
in
this
case
can
still
on
--
and
ask
for
a
reversal
of
the
trial
court's
judgment
and
the
appellate
court's
opinion
on
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
trial
court.
indeed,
the
trial
court
was,
itself,
not
quite
sure
about
its
own
position
in
the
matter
because
as
you
will
note
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
it
does
not,
no,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
as
to
both.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
as
to
the
shipowner
as
well
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
city
of
galveston.
as
to
the
shipowner,
of
course,
the
court
made
findings
of
fact
that
the
shipowner
through
its
agent
knew
of
this
pre
--
previous
instances
and
having
knowledge
that
such
a
condition
exists
or
may
exist
at
the
galveston
warehouse
wharfage,
they
should
have
taken
certain
precautions
which
we
say
they
have
not
taken.
now,
had
the
court's
finding
found
that
they
had
no
such
knowledge,
a
different
situation
might
exist.
but
the
court
found
the
exact
knowledge
of
these
facts
as
in
knowledge
as
to
both,
the
city
as
well
as
to
the
ship.
i
think
that
in
1962,
there
is
no
longer
any
question
under
the
applicable
law
whether
the
vessel
could
or
could
not
have
done
something
about
it.
let
us
assume
purely
for
argument's
sake
that
this
was
the
first
instance
that
this
occasion
arose,
that
there
were
no
previous
instances
given
notice
to
the
--
to
the
ship
or
to
the
city
of
such
conditions
but
particularly
to
the
ship
because
i'm
discussing
seaworthiness.
and
this
is
the
first
instant
that
it
happened.
the
fact
remains
that
this
court
has
held
that
once
it
is
established,
that
the
area
where
these
longshoremen
were
working
was
not
reasonably
fit
to
permit
them
to
do
that
work
with
safety
and
damages,
illness,
injury
resulted
there
from
as
the
law
stands
today
liability
is
imposed.
just
for
instance,
like
in
the
petterson
case
versus
alaska
steamship
company,
the
--
the
stevedore
board
in
a
hook
which
upon
inspection
was
in
all
respects
just
fine.
it
had
a
latent
defect.
they
couldn't
discover
and
nothing
they
could
do
about
it
but
it
had
--
it
turned
out
to
be
a
latent
defect.
injury
occurred,
liability
was
imposed.
i
submit
that
it
is
no
difference
between
a
latent
defect,
which
the
shipowner
could
not
have
done
anything
about
it
and
the
condition
here.
really,
the
crucial
question
to
--
that
i
see
in
this
case
is
whether
a
hatch
that
is
without
defect
in
which
cargo
is
put
and
that
cargo,
it
contains,
is
always
of
such
character
or
contains
rather
obnoxious
fumes,
gases
fumes
or
any
other
condition
which
reduces
injury
whether
or
not
liability
imposes.
now,
frankly,
i
think
this
is
the
crux
of
the
case
here
and
this
has
been
the
crux
of
the
case
and
all
other
cases
under
similar
circumstances.
i
don't
see
how
the
shipowner
could
have
anticipated
and
fish
gurry
may
have
gotten
--
might
have
gotten
on
that
rail
of
the
vessel
as
they
did
in
the
mitchell
case
or
--
or
some
cargo
that
was
brought
in
that
shifted
during
the
voyage.
these
are
the
topic
cases
that
are
applicable
in
the
case
here.
another
case,
i
think,
that
came
out
in
the
fourth
circuit
is
the
grosbaski
(ph)
case
where
the
stevedoring
company
put
plane
jelly
on
the
deck
in
order
to
make
it
easier
to
load
the
--
the
cargo
that
had
--
had
to
slide
on
it.
somebody
--
some
longshoreman
slipped
on
the
plane
jelly
and
the
court
held
that
under
such
facts,
the
fact
that
was
it
a
transitory
condition
that
a
shipowner
didn't
know
anything
about
it,
had
nothing
to
do
with
it,
that
does
not
constitute
any
defense
in
this
case.
the
--
the
appellate
court
probably
mistaken
stated
this,
“if
it
had
been
claimed
here
as
it
could
not
be
that
the
damages
resulted
from
the
flood
of
grain
closing
the
hatch
and
shutting
off
the
air
or
for
many
thing
else
then
the
on
toward
and
expe
--
unexpected
factors
that
the
last
amount
of
grain
loaded
was
charged
with
a
fum
--
fumigant
the
question
would
be
different.”
well,
of
course,
judge
hutcheson
misunderstood
the
facts,
the
evidence
and
the
court
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
flood
of
grain
close
the
hatch
and
shu
--
shut
off
all
air.
and
--
but
the
fact
that
it
was
unexpected.
there's
no
defense
on
this
case
because
that
again
brings
in
the
doctrine
of
unseawo
--
unforeseeabi
--
foreseeability
or
knowledge.
now,
under
this
state
of
facts,
we
submit
the
liability
in
this
case
is
imposed.
but
the
court,
the
trial
court
in
its
findings
of
fact
numbers
9,
10,
11
and
19
established
unseaworthiness.
and
the
trial
court
in
its
findings
of
fact,
that
number
i
which
i
do
not
know
remember,
giving
finding
as
a
fact
that
this
--
the
steamship
company
as
well
as
the
city
of
galveston
had
knowledge
of
the
previous
conditions
that
existed.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
certainly,
because
in
the
negligence,
they
have
to
--
they
have
to
exercise
ordinary
care
and
of
course
they
could
not
exercise
ordinary
care
without
foreseeing
that
something
like
that
may
likely
happen
or
some
similar
event.
but
the
trial
courts
found
the
findings
of
fact
that
they
did.
i
submit
that
the
trial
court's
findings
of
fact
can
be
lightened
to
a
situation
where
a
jury
may
find
that
accidental
headlights
and
fail
to
keep
a
proper
look
at
but
it
was
no
negligence.
such
a
finding
could
not
possibly
be
sustained
and
that's
exactly
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
we
have,
of
course,
one
third
point
here
but,
frankly,
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
a
matter
for
this
court
to
consider
or
not.
i
couldn't
get
it
from
the
rules
that
i
frankly
don't
know.
and
that
is
that
the
trial
court
obviously
not
sure
itself
whether
the
findings
of
fact
it
had
made
constitute
unseaworthiness
or
not,
went
further
and
assessed
damages
in
this
case
after
finding
no
liability.
we
urge
in
our
brief
and
we
urge
here
now
that
the
damages
went
out
unrealistic.
they're
grossly
inadequate
as
to
--
i
think
shock
this
court
evidently
didn't
shock
the
court
below,
i'm
talking
about
the
trial
court.
judge
reeves
there
--
there
wasn't
impressed
with
the
fact
that
certainly
the
point
merited
attention.
but
i
don't
want
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes
--
no,
the
majority
opinion
did
not
but
--
but
a
dissent
did.
and
i
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
well,
that's
why
i
said
i
don't
know.
i
do
know
that
an
appellate
court
has,
in
an
admiralty
case,
has
the
power
and
authority
to
increase
the
damages
that
has
done
some
number
of
times
whether
this
court
can
or
will
do
it,
i
don't
know.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
well
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
judge
reeves
just
said
just
that.
and
i
think
judge
reeves
did
not
consult
the
authorities
on
that
because
i
have,
at
least
on
two
occasions,
taken
up
cases
from
the
seventh
district
of
texas
to
the
fifth
circuit
where
they
increased
the
damages.
and
i
think
that
send
it
back
to
the
trial
court
would
not
be
the
proper
thing
to
do.
and
this
court
sees
fit
not
to
do
it.
and
i
think
it
ought
to
be
done
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
not
going
to
present
the
--
for
this
court
any
unseaworthy
fish
or
any
unseaworthy
condition
that
does
not
relate
exactly
to
the
ship
in
question.
as
i
understand
the
argument
presented
by
my
colleagues,
(a)
they
state
because
the
court
found
that
the
noxious
fumes
and
insecticide
has
been
placed
at
a
inland
place
somewhere
that
--
that
absolves
them
of
all
responsibility.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
that
simply
cannot
be
solved
under
our
system
of
jurisprudence.
they
conceded
as
they
had
to
that
it
was
known
to
the
industry,
it
was
known
to
the
galveston
wharves,
it
was
known
to
the
--
the
agent
of
the
steamship
company
that
such
practice
is
engaged
in
by
the
industry.
now,
what
steps
had
they
taken
to
prevent
an
occurrence
such
as
this,
especially
in
view
of
the
past
history
in
that
very
port?
now,
they
state
that
inspections
have
been
made
by,
at
the
time
the
railroad
cars
came
in,
and
when
it
goes
into
the
bin.
but
i
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
simply
not
so
and
the
record
said
it.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes
sir,
there
was
a
finding
that
the
--
it
could
not
have
been
discovered.
and
of
course,
i
am
stuck
with
this
finding
and
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
set
aside
any
such
finding
except
to
say
that
the
finding
of
negligence
itself
of
no
negligence
rather
itself
is
erroneous
conclusion
of
law
under
the
very
record
in
the
case.
if
you
will
permit
me
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
it's
erroneous
on
the
record.
i
say
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
to
support
no
negligence
and
i
may
submit
this
to
the
court
as
follows.
the
--
a
mr.
carroll
who
was
the
superintendent
of
the
galveston
wharves
was
called
as
a
witness.
and
on
page
26
of
my
brief,
this
witness
testified
in
rather
detail
how
the
--
the
grain
comes
into
various
bins
and
that
certain
bins
are
fumigated
and
others
are
not,
that
they
keep
a
record
of
the
bins
that
are
fumigated.
but
it
further
testified
that
from
time-to-time,
the
grain
is
shifted
from
one
bin
to
another
and
there
is
no
record
of
the
--
of
the
grain
that
has
been
shifted.
there
only
is
a
record
of
a
bin
and
the
court
--
when
the
court
realized
that,
it's
stopped
them
and
the
court
asked
him
this
question.
the
point
i'm
making
is,
if
you
don't
know
a
body's
possible
transfers
from
bin
one
to
bin
two,
how
can
you
tell
me
conclusively
that
a
grain
from
bin
two
that
went
in
to
the
vessel
had
not
been
switched
around
and
hence
perhaps
hadn't
been
fumigated,
do
you
follow
me?
in
other
words
based
--
the
evidence
was
that
they
loaded
that
bin
from
so
many
number
bins,
but
also
--
the
evidence
was
also
undisputed
that
there
was
no
record
kept
if
grain
in
bin
five
that
was
fumigated,
was
transferred
to
bin
two.
in
other
words,
they
kept
the
record
of
the
bins
that
were
fumigated
but
not
of
the
grain
and
the
grain
was
constantly
shifted
from
one
bin
to
another.
and
the
court
says
--
the
court
asked
him,
"do
you
follow
me?"
the
witness
says,
"i
follow
you."
“there
is
a
slight
possibility
that
a
small
amount
of
that
could
have
happened?”
“yes
sir.”
the
court,
“and
your
records
would
not
show
the
contrary?”
the
witness,
"no,
sir."
the
court,
“wouldn't
show
either
way?”
"no,
sir."
actually,
there
was
n
record
that
the
bins
of
--
of
the
grain
that
was
actually
fumigated
but
only
on
the
bins
and
there
record
is
undisputed
that
a
grain
would
be
shifted
from
one
bin
to
another.
there
is
more
than
that
your
honor.
the
record
is
undisputed
that
a
tests
that
were
made
as
mr.
watson
stated,
was
for
the
quality
of
the
grain
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
it
has
been
fumigated
or
not.
and
how
did
they
go
about
it?
they
go
to
a
car
--
the
railroad
car
that
comes
alongside.
if
it
comes
in
by
12,
there
is
no
--
apparently,
no
method
of
inspecting
it.
but
go
to
a
car
and
they
pick
up
a
sample
of
the
car.
they
take
that
bin
away,
some
distance
away.
and
sometime
later
in
some
laboratory,
somebody
makes
a
test
to
their
grain
for
the
quality
or
whether
that
has
weevils
in
it
or
not.
now,
they
say
incidentally,
if
there
is
some
unusual
odor
we
noted,
but
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
in
this
record
that
any
inspection
was
ever
made.
now,
this
is
fortified
by
further
testimony
and
the
court
was
interested
in
it
and
a
witness
by
the
name
of
goss,
he
was
the
sampler
who
stayed
on
the
ship
and
as
the
grain
came
out
from
the
spot,
took
some
samples.
and
he
--
this
man
was
present
when
these
men
were
buried
in
their
bin
and
when
they
were
pulled
out,
he
asked
them,
"did
you
yourself
see
the
mill?"
"yes
sir,
i
saw
the
mill."
"well,
did
it
seem
to
you
that
our
air
from
fumigant.”
“it
seemed
to
me
that
way.”
"did
you
then
take
your
sample
to
test,
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
that
grain?"
he
said,
"no,
sir."
"well
didn't
it
seem
to
you
that
that
was
the
time
to
do
it?"
he
said,
"no,
sir
because
i
do
not
test
it
for
that
purpose."
but
the
evidence
goes
further
than
that.
immediately
above
the
vessel
or
before
the
last
bin
--
the
grain
in
the
last
bin
has
poured
into
the
spout,
no
tests
were
made.
at
the
crucial
point,
now
this
was
a
shot
of
500
bushels
of
grain
that
obviously
was
contaminated.
now,
what
did
the
ship
do
about
it?
with
the
knowledge
that
they
had
of
the
previous
condition,
nothing
but
absolutely
nothing,
they
just
assumed
that
everything
would
be
alright.
now
then,
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
yesterday,
"what
could
they
have
done?"
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
they
could
have
done.
but
frankly
under
the
doctrine
established
by
this
court
and
what
i
thought
firmly
established
by
this
court,
knowledge
is
not
prerequisite
and
it
has
been
found
in
this
--
in
this
cashew
oil
grounds.
some
seamen
while
loading
some
cashew
nut
--
cashew
nut
oil,
drums
of
cashew
nut
oil
and
some
of
them
got
into
their
hands
because
it
was
a
leaky
drum.
it
was
just
gotten
in
onboard
ship.
the
vessel
had
no
knowledge
of
the
situation,
couldn't
have
had
a
knowledge.
there
was
no
question
in
the
district
judge's
mind
that
that
was
an
unseaworthy
condition.
there're
many
other
cases,
in
the
boudoin
case
decided
by
this
court.
(inaudible)
know
of
the
vicious
disposition
in
propensities
of
the
seaman
until
the
assault,
he
was
a
calm
gentleman.
until
under
certain
conditions,
he
became
vicious.
this
court
held
that
seaman
to
render
the
vessel
unseaworthy.
in
the
johnson
line
versus
maloney,
there
was
presence
of
wheat
dust
and
wheat
kernels
on
the
deck.
a
situation
that
to
me
it
would
seem
comparable
to
the
--
to
the
sample
that
mr.
watson
gave
and
so
the
rest
of
the
trade
because
you
cannot
load
grain,
i
don't
think,
without
getting
some
kernels
on
the
deck
or
some
wheat
dust,
but
the
court
held
that
to
be
an
unseaworthy
condition.
this
is
not
a
case
where
you
--
when
you're
a
fisherman
and
when
you're
a
fishermen,
has
certain
no
risks,
that
i
take
coming
here
to
speak
before
this
court,
this
is
a
great
court.
i
don't
care
how
many
times
anybody
comes
before
you,
i
assure
you
that
a
steep
channel
and
somebody
may
have
a
weak
heart
and
rock.
that's
a
risk
of
my
trade.
i
can't
help
it.
but
that's
not
a
situation
as
it
happened
here
in
the
grillea
case.
in
the
grillea
case
somebody
just
--
longshoreman
picked
up
a
--
a
hatch
cover
and
improperly
placed
it.
the
ship-owner
didn't
really
think
about
it,
the
master
was
probably
sure
buying
his
wife's
clothes
and
the
loading
made
probably
done
in
the
galley
drinking
coffee.
he
didn't
know
anything
about
it
but
this,
the
court
imposed
liability
on
this
thing
and
put
in
investors
v.
united
states.
an
apple
peel,
somebody
slipped
on
an
apple
peel,
i
mean
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
draw
the
line
in
the
situations
for
instance,
i've
gone
aboard
the
vessel,
i'm
a
longshoreman
and
i
carry
my
--
my
hook
and
i
swing
my
hook
because
i
feel
good
this
morning,
and
i
swing
it
right
into
my
hand.
certainly,
that
didn't
render
anything
unseaworthy
or
another
longshoreman
trips
me,
not
meaning
to.
that
didn't
render
the
vessel
unseaworthy
or
i
trip
over
my
own
feet.
that
didn't
render
unseaworthy,
numerous
cases
where
i
can
illustrate.
but
here,
there
was
an
absolute
failure
to
supply
a
safe
place
to
which
that
there's
then
no
question
about
that,
that
a
vessel
was
rendered
unsafe
for
the
purpose
for
which
these
men
went
down
there
to
work.
the
court
so
finds
and
relies
only
on
the
transitory
doctrine
because
it
happened
just
like
this.
this
argument
that
a
ship
couldn't
have
done
anything
about
it,
it
has
been
made
many
times
before.
and
as
i
stated
yesterday,
the
finest
example
is
the
--
the
petterson
versus
alaska
steamship
company
when
they
had
a
--
hook
that
look
just
tripping
and
it
had
a
latent
defect.
this
court
had
no
hesitation
to
affirm
the
case.
and
now,
the
crumady
case
decided
by
this
court,
you
remember
in
that
case,
there
was
a
good
(inaudible)
but
it
was
improperly
used,
made
defective.
it
was
not
inherently
defective
but
made
defective
by
the
longshoreman
working
with
it.
this
court
had
no
hesitation
to
impose
liability
in
this
(inaudible)
case.
i
submit
that
this
case
is
a
classic
example
of
a
place
where
the
longshoremen
were
working
in
an
area
that
was
not
reasonably
safe
to
do
their
work,
expected
and
intended
of
them.
the
shipowner
should've
known
about
it,
had
knowledge
of
similar
instances.
there
is
both
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
of
this
case.
i
say
just
--
this
is
not
an
inherent
dangerous
thing
to
do,
longshoremen
do
it
with
safety
all
the
time.
it
is
only
under
the
circumstances
in
which
the
commodity
is
--
becomes
dangerous
by
reason
of
somebody's
act,
renders
the
area
not
reasonably
safe
to
do
the
work.
i
believe
that
the
mesle,
a
260
f.2nd
747,
sets
out
that
--
that
the
standard,
i
think,
correctly
what
constitutes
and
what
does
not
constitute
to
unseaworthiness.
in
this
instance,
the
shipowner
had
actual
or
constructive
notice
that
grain
is
being
fumigated.
it
has
happened
in
that
port
before.
the
shipowner
didn't
lift
a
finger
that
discharge
his
duty.
under
such
circumstances,
we
submit
the
liability
is
imposed
under
the
law
as
we
know
it.
thank
you
very
much.
