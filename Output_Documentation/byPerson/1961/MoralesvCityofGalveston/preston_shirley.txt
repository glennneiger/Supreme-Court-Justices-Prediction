mr.
preston
shirley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
will
be
a
divided
argument.
i
represent
the
city
of
galveston,
take
a
short
time
and
then
the
remainder
of
the
time
will
be
so
taken
by
--
mr.
preston
shirley
--
cardigan
shipping
company.
if
the
court
please,
this
started
as
a
suit
in
admiralty,
a
vessel
longshoreman
in
which
the
original
allegations
for
against
the
city
of
galveston
for
negligence
in
fumigating
certain
grain
and
went
aboard
a
vessel.
there
is
a
subsidiary
allegation
that
the
city
had
failed
to
inspect
or
test
the
grain.
the
case
against
the
city
of
galveston
was
strictly
consoled
on
the
allegations
of
negligence,
nothing
else.
as
against
the
respondent,
cardigan
shipping
company,
the
case
was
presented
there
against
that
company
for
negligence
in
hand
to
inspect
the
test
and
on
an
allegation
of
unseaworthiness
by
way
of
a
brief
description
of
the
operation
to
the
elevator,
this
primary
at
an
export
house
to
water
sack.
the
grain,
when
it
comes
in
mostly
by
railcars,
is
tested
and
sampled
for
the
galveston
exchange
board
of
trade
inspectors
and
supervisor
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
that
inspection
was
made
while
the
car
is
still
in
the
yard,
five
samples
were
taken.
if
there's
anything
shows
up
bad
then,
it
will
be
noted.
then
the
car
is
taken
to
the
elevator;
unload
it,
again
by
opening
the
doors
and
by
a
person
near
the
elevator.
it
then
goes
in
by
gravity
down
into
a
container,
has
taken
by
elevating
legs
about
1000
buckets
running
this
way
sir,
up
to
the
escape
holes,
where
it's
weighed
then
it
goes
by
shoot,
down
to
its
conveyor
belts
and
goes
by
conveyor
belts
to
the
various
--
one
of
the
400
semi
bins
in
the
elevator.
while
in
the
elevator,
stays
generally
speaking
in
the
same
vent.
after
that,
and
when
it's
desired
to
export,
the
owner
will
order
so
many
bushels
over
a
certain
grade
of
grain.
it
is
a
mixed
house
in
the
sense
that
there's
no
one's
grain
owned
by
--
it
can
be
identified
as
such.
you
can
identify
by
grade
owners.
after
the
order
is
placed,
a
lineup
was
made
out
of
which
the
grain
will
be
taken,
that
is
to
particular
bins
and
then
there's
not
just
at
the
bottom
of
each
bin,
you
take
the
conveyor
belt
that
open
up
it
so
many
notches,
having
to
use
the
various
grades
to
get
the
desired
grade
to
go
into
the
ship
and
then
runs
on
this
conveyor
belt
to
an
elevating
leg
again
and
goes
back
up
to
the
scales,
again
on
the
--
and
then
again
on
the
conveyer
belt
and
to
a
shipping
bin
roughly
housed
to
the
ship.
stevedore
or
the
chief
stevedore,
well
then
order
the
grain
to
be
released
by
telephone
and
the
city
employees
do
it.
the
city
has
no
relation
to,
no
control
over
or
no
connection
with
the
ship.
therefore,
there's
no
relation
to,
no
control
over
or
any
connection
with
any
question
of
unseaworthiness.
mr.
preston
shirley
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
made
while
they're
in
the
eleva
--
while
in
the
railroad
cars
adjoining
the
elevator.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes
sir.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes
sir.
now,
i
might
say
this
your
honor,
the
inspection
is
a
double
barrel
knot.
it's
primarily
for
grade
--
mr.
preston
shirley
for
grade.
mr.
preston
shirley
hardly,
whether
wheat
number
one,
number
two
and
so
on.
mr.
preston
shirley
they
take
five
samples.
they
take
it
all
to
laboratory.
if
there's
any
obnoxious
odors
noted
or
if
the
inspectors
find
any,
they
will
note
it
on
what
is
known
as
pan
ticket
which
is
a
record
of
the
car
that
goes
through
the
elevator
under
permanent
record.
mr.
preston
shirley
that's
the
first
inspection
sir.
mr.
preston
shirley
now,
that
is
not
a
chemical
test
your
honor,
but
it
is
an
older
test
by
moving
in
the
car,
smelling
it
and
then
taking
the
samples
over
to
the
laboratory
to
grade
it.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes,
sir.
mr.
preston
shirley
mr.
justice,
in
certain
cases
if
the
grain
is
found
to
be
weevily.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes
sir.
has
--
if
it
has
weeviled,
there
will
be
fumigant
put
in
while
it's
in
the
railroad
car
by
the
name
of
--
mr.
preston
shirley
high
life
sir.
and
--
mr.
preston
shirley
no
sir,
they
open
the
car,
pour
it
on
top,
spray
it
over
the
top
of
it.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes
sir.
and
high
life
is
non-damage
into
humans,
maximum
of
72
hours,
actually
at
the
20
--
mr.
preston
shirley
it
is
for
about
24
hours
sir,
then
from
24
or
48,
not
considered.
and
certainly
after
72,
there's
no
question
but
it's
not
harmful
at
all
then.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes
sir
it's
kept
in
the
car
for
that
period
of
time
and
then
the
board
of
trade
goes
back,
reinspects
it
and
clears
it
for
unloading.
there's
always
a
second
inspection,
if
high
life
is
put
on
the
--
if
the
fumigant
in
the
car.
now,
in
further
carrying
out
your
honor's
question
on
the
--
on
the
occasion,
into
the
elevator
if
it
gets
weevily,
a
fumigant
by
the
name
of
“weevil-cide”
would
be
put
on
it.
but
again,
you
have
the
24
and
48
to
72
hour
proposition.
mr.
preston
shirley
well,
sir
there
has
never
been
an
incident
like
this
before.
there
had
been
three
incidents,
the
lipscomb
lykes
in
1949
where
judge
kennedy,
the
southern
district
found
that
at
the
elevator
had
actually
fumigated
the
grain
and
then
shut
it
on
in
without
a
necessary
time
elapsing.
and
in
panamolga
case
which
was
--
to
which
the
city
was
not
a
part,
it
was
again
found
that
the
city
fumigated
the
grain
while
it
was
in
the
elevator.
and
in
the
zosianne
it
was
alleged,
and
that's
in
'53
the
last
incident,
that
the
city
had
fumigated
the
grain.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes
sir.
mr.
preston
shirley
it
is
held
out
until
they're
removed
sir
and
that
the
board
of
trade
passes
the
car
for
unloading.
mr.
preston
shirley
now,
if
the
court
please
then,
coming
down
to
what
the
trial
court
found,
it
was
a
seventh
or
eighth-day
trial.
numerous
witnesses
were
introduced;
all
the
records
were
introduced.
the
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
city
did
not
fumigate
the
grain
either
in
railroad
cars
or
while
in
the
elevator.
and
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
say
that
there's
--
there's
no
comfortable
incident
in
the
sense
that
the
others
were
allegations
or
findings
that
the
city
hate
and
in
this
and
it's
an
absolute
finding
of
the
trial
court
which
by
the
way
is
not
attacked
here
to
the
effect
that
we
did
not
fumigate
the
grain.
the
court
also
found
that
there
was
improper
fumigation
had
an
inland
point
that
is
before
we
put
it
on
the
railcars
for
transportation
to
galveston
and
that
the
fumigant
there
was
chloropicrin.
that
finding
is
not
attacked.
the
court
further
found
that
the
city
did
not
know
and
the
exercise
a
reasonable
care
should
not
have
known
of
any
improper
inland
fumigation.
the
court
also
found
that
the
city
had
never
received
any
knowledge
of
any
prior
instance
of
this
kind.
all
those
findings
if
the
court
please,
are
not
attacked.
they're
accepted.
there's
no
attack
laid
on
here.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
city
had
knowledge
of
those
three
were
the
allegations
and
findings
where
that
the
city
had
fumigated.
mr.
preston
shirley
the
trial
for
here
found
we
did
not
fumigate
it.
mr.
preston
shirley
now,
and
that
there
was
an
inland
fumigation,
an
improper
inland
fumigation
that
caused
trouble.
mr.
preston
shirley
the
trial
court
found
we
had
the
--
had
no
notice
or
knowledge
of
any
prior
instance
of
improper
inland
fumigation.
however,
it's
put
on
--
mr.
preston
shirley
yes
sir
or
any
other
case
actually.
it
never
happened
before.
mr.
preston
shirley
oh
the
court
found
we
had
knowledge
of
those,
sir.
mr.
preston
shirley
there
were
suits
against
the
city.
there's
no
que
--
mr.
preston
shirley
as
a
matter
of
fact
sir,
the
suits
were
brought
for
--
an
allegation
to
fumigation
by
the
city
and
that
about
the
third
as
the
record
shows,
the
management
was
changed
and
an
entirely
system
of
control
to
put
into
be
sure
it
didn't
happen
again.
so
--
is
that
--
mr.
preston
shirley
yes
sir.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes
sir.
mr.
preston
shirley
no
sir
and
the
record
is
undisputed
that
throughout
the
industry
over
the
many,
many
years.
this
is
a
first
case
of
inland
fumigation,
the
chloropicrin
or
any
other
substance
to
cause
many
trouble.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes
sir,
we
did.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes,
sir
and
the
tie
to
control
the
records,
so
we
knew
exactly
where
everything
was.
as
a
matter
of
fact
sir
on
this
one,
the
72
hours
was
the
maximum
then,
it
only
limited
here.
the
last
fumigation
for
the
city
was
february,
i
believe,
the
27th
on
a
march
14th
incident.
mr.
preston
shirley
no
sir.
the
court
found
sir,
as
in
fact
that
we
were
not
negligent
in
failing
to
learn
or
to
know
the
presence
of
the
inland
fumigation.
the
court
found
we
were
not
negligent
in
failing
to
make
additional
inspections.
the
court
found
that
we
made
careful
and
plain
taking
inspections
and
examinations
and
that
they
failed
to
detect
anything
and
the
court
found
in
addition
that
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
additional
inspections
would
have
been
more
successful.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes,
sir.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes,
sir.
mr.
preston
shirley
yes.
sir.
mr.jusitice
--
mr.
preston
shirley
no
sir.
mr.
preston
shirley
sir,
we
have
no
idea
because
it's
a
commingled
house
and
it
can
come
anywhere
from
nebraska
west
to
any
gulf
port.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
cannot
an
--
there's
no
way
to
answer
that
question
sir.
now,
continuing
just
a
minute
on
it,
the
--
let's
say
we
have
trial
court's
findings
completely
to
the
effects
we
were
not
negligent
in
every
respect.
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
court
held
that
there's
no
basis
whatever
for
attack
on
the
trial
court's
finding,
that's
the
fact.
it
also
held
that
the
trial
court's
findings
were
well-supported
and
wholly
reasonable.
it
didn't
came
to
this
court
on
the
argument
about
unseaworthiness
between
petitioners
and
co-respondent,
cardigan
shipping
company,
this
court
sent
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
consideration;
lie
to
mitchell
versus
trawler
racer.
we
did
not
participate
in
the
argument
--
second
argument
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
because
there
was
no
attack
made
upon
us
one
way
or
another.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
understand
counsel's
argument
pretty
much
yesterday,
he
says
that
the
crux
of
this
case
was
unseaworthiness
and
if
that's
true,
if
the
court
please,
i
may
--
my
fact
findings
may
get
out.
thank
you
very
much.
