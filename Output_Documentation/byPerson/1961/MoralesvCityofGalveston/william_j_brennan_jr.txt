--
you
have
both
the
shipowner
and
the
city
yield
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
the
unseaworthiness
claim
doesn't
go
against
the
--
the
city?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
any
--
that
action
has
to
be
predicated
on
negligence,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
what
you
now
arguing
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
of
negligence
as
to
the
city
or
as
to
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
both,
i
see.
but
have
you
--
have
we
any
question
of
negligence
as
to
the
shipowner
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
the
shipowner
as
well?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
you
prevail
out
of
the
issue
of
liabilities,
should
we
pass
on
the
adequacy
of
question
without
first
hearing
to
the
court
of
appeals?

it's

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well
mr.
shirley,
was
there
any
finding
of
any
deficiency
on
the
part
of
the
city
in
its
inspections
which
might
perhaps
have
--
have
discovered
whatever
may
had
been
the
condition
resulting
from
the
inland
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
to
say
mr.
watson
that
the
actual
finding
of
--
whatever
you
call
that
chemical.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
been
introduced
at
some
inland
point
and
not
either
at
galveston
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
--
so
the
finding
is
that
had
to
be
--
had
been
introduced.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
on
--
in
this
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you're
relying
particularly
on
the
finding
of
this
condition,
the
happen
stands
of
a
combination
of
factors,
is
that
it,
that
there
was
nothing
anyone
could
do
when
the
heat
as
it
came
in
from
the
bin
and
suddenly
combined
with
the
conditions
within
the
bin
to
make
gaseous
but
there
before,
had
just
been
a
sub-mass,
isn't
that
it?
on
the
seaworthiness
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
the
way
you
distinguished
trawler
racer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
this
how
you
distinguished
trawler
racer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
finding
about
inspections
mr.
mandell.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

on
the
record,
you
mean
on
the
findings,
it's
erroneous?
