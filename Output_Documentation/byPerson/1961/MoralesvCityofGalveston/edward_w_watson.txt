mr.
edward
w.
watson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
although,
i
believe
the
run
of
my
argument
will
have
to
be
with
the
question
of
unseaworthiness,
i'd
like
briefly
to
take
up
where
mr.
shirley
left
off
with
the
question
of
negligence
to
advert
to
the
characteristics
of
chloropicrin,
the
particular
fumigant
that
was
found
by
the
trial
court
to
have
been
involved
in
this
case.
actually,
this
was
one
of
these
extremely
coincidental
matters
that
the
fumigant
ever
got
to
this
particular
balance.
chloropicrin
is
applied
as
a
watery
liquid.
i
mean
it's
supposed
to
be
sprinkled
over
the
grain
in
the
inland
granary
or
in
the
railroad
cars
or
cars
being
loaded.
an
expert
testified
at
the
trial
that
the
only
possible
way
that
this
chloropicrin
got
through
to
this
bin
on
the
grelmarion
was
that
somebody
carelessly
dumped
a
lot
of
this
watery
liquid
on
to
a
particular
portion
of
the
grain.
there
was
really
a
sudden
mass
of
grain
at
being
a
watery
type
of
liquid
unlike
the
more
gaseous
types.
this
wet
grain
was
able
to
survive
the
journey
in
the
railcars,
the
elevation
and
through
the
galveston
wharves
elevator,
the
weighing,
the
shifting
into
bins,
the
measuring
out,
the
mixing,
the
putting
in
the
loading
bin
and
the
travel
down
to
shoot
from
the
elevator
into
the
vessel.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
chloropicrin
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
the
chloropicrin
was
never
used
at
--
at
seaports.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
the
medical
testimony
and
also
some
late
testimony
as
well
as
the
expert's,
indicating
that
the
characteristics
of
the
fumigant
experienced
by
the
libelants
was
such
--
it
was
a
pretty
sure
thing,
it
was
chloropicrin.
it
affects
the
eyes,
i
mean
there
was
one
bit
of
evidence
that
to
me
was
very
conclusive
and
that
these
men
were
taken
for
first
aid
to
a
doctor's
office
and
the
nurse
in
that
office,
the
day
following,
noticed
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a
watery
substance
that
gotten
on
her
clothing
that
made
here
eyes
smart.
it
might
also
be
said
and
because
this
is
somewhat
relevant
to
the
issue
of
damages
which
is
raised
by
the
petitioner
here,
the
chlo
--
the
another
characteristic
of
chloropicrin
unlike
some
of
the
other
fumigants
used
which
are
chlorinated
hydrocarbons,
the
chloropicrin
can
be
highly
annoying
but
if
it's
sufficiently
concentrated,
it
kills
you.
if
it's
not
that
well
concentrated,
you
get
over
it
rather
quickly,
it
has
immediate
effects
but
they're
passing.
there's
no
permanent
damage
to
deliver
such
as
with
result
from
weevil-cide
which
is
a
chlorinated
hydrocarbon
or
the
high
life
which
is
never
used
on
ships,
incidentally
because
it's
too
volatile
and
too
explosive.
it
all
--
might
also
be
said
while
we
are
talking
about
what
was
the
chemical
involved
here
that
the
libelants
made
in
the
trial
court
and
have
since
raised
in
their
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
their
brief
the
question
of
an
absence
of
--
of
test
as
called
for
by
government
literature?
actually,
the
court
disregarded
all
of
that
evidence
and
i
think
it
should
be
disregarded
here
because
the
literature
referred
to
test
of
grain
for
the
purpose
of
human
consumption.
and
actually,
there
was
an
exception
in
this
--
in
these
manuals
and
said
it
did
not
apply
to
the
application
of
these
kind
of
fumigants
that
we
were
discussing
here
to
grains,
but
they
were
talking
about
some
other
grains.
this
is
at
page
714
of
the
record.
that
the
ethylene
dibromide
and
methobromide
or
the
kind
of
things
that
could
penetrate
a
grain
and
make
it
unfit
for
human
consumption
and
these
were
the
things
that
miller,
under
the
food
and
drug
actually
test
for.
but
these
were
not
the
kind
of
chemicals
that
were
ever
used
in
fumigating
grains
in
elevators
or
in
railcars
or
on
ships
to
get
rid
of
weevils.
but
i
--
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
matter
of
the
chloropicrin
because
i
wanted
to
illustrate
the
extreme
coincidence
that
ever
brought
it
in
to
this
area
where
it
caused
the
affliction
to
these
libelants,
i
mean
it
took
an
extreme
chain
of
circumstances,
just-right
atmospheric
conditions
to
keep
it
from
dissipating.
and
apparently,
the
heat
generated
by
the
last
trip
down
the
spout,
from
the
elevator
into
the
bin
of
the
ship
was
just
right
with
other
conditions
to
make
this
watery
substance
turn
into
gassy
substance
and
as
it
came
out
of
the
spout
and
into
the
bin
on
the
ship,
the
men
there
immediately
felt
the
effects
coming
off
the
grain.
now,
this
is,
to
me,
the
second
factual
point
that
is
of
high
importance
in
this
case.
the
evidence
--
all
of
the
longshoreman,
i
believe,
testified
and
their
evidence
as
well
as
the
evidence
of
other
men
who
were
in
the
bin
but
are
not
parties
to
this
case,
was
all
to
the
effect
that
they
immediately
felt
something
smarting
their
eyes
and
making
them
tear
as
the
grain
was
still
coming
out
of
the
spout
and
before
them
into
this
closed-in
bin
where
they
will
work.
in
other
words,
they
received
whatever
toxic
effects
they
received
directly
off
the
grain.
there's
a
mark
difference
in
that
connection
between
--
and
i
think
the
circuit
court
so
noticed
as
mr.
mandell
referred
to
it
yesterday.
between
that
case
and
the
case
where
maybe
the
grain
had
been
piled
up
so
high
that
the
men
exhausted
the
oxygen
in
the
air
that
they
were
working,
and
for
lack
of
a
fresh
supply
of
oxygen,
they
were
asphyxiated.
the
medical
testimony
in
this
case
was
not
of
asphyxiation
or
a
lack
of
oxygen
at
all.
the
medical
testimony
in
this
case
was
of
an
acute
intoxication
which
meant
that
a
gas
of
toxic
effect
was
inhaled
directly
and
suddenly,
i
mean
it
wasn't
chronic
or
accumulated.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
actually
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
as
the
grain
has
run
up
in
the
opening,
these
bins
are
about
10-feet
high
and
they're
about
15
feet
by
20.
i
forgot
the
exact
dimensions.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
this
bin
was
already
three
fourths
full
of
grain.
this
was
practically
the
last
shot
of
grain
to
be
put
aboard
the
ship
in
this
bin,
so
the
working
space
had
become
very
small.
but
as
the
trial
court
heard
and
the
trial
court
found,
it
was
entirely
normal
that
as
this
bin
is
--
this
grain
has
run
out
of
this
elevator
shoot,
they
temporarily
cover
the
opening
to
the
bin
and
the
men
start
pulling
that
grain
away
with
their
woods,
scoops
or
shovels.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
that
the
--
the
outlet
to
the
air
is
--
is
closed.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
but
--
mr.
edward
w.
watson
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
on
the
record
in
this
case,
that
would
not
be
true.
i
think
the
evidence
is
so
strongly
that
the
effects
were
felt
directly
off
the
grain.
i
don't
know
--
incidentally,
it
might
also
be
said
that
the
hysteria
that
developed
was
due
to
an
initial
suspicion
that
this
may
have
been
a
fumigant
such
as
involved
in
those
three
prior
incidents
that
happened
more
than
four
years
--
the
last,
more
than
the
four
years
previously
where
the
fumigant
used
was
a
chlorinated
hydrocarbon.
and
i'm
sure
all
of
us
that
had
the
careless
experience
of
one
time
or
another
whiffing
an
open
bottle
of
carbon
tetrachloride
which
is
chlorinated
hydrocarbon.
and
even
though
we
are
in
this
room
with
all
the
oxygen
and
everything
that's
around
us,
that
--
that
gas
as
we
whiff
it
is
very
penetrating.
it
immediately
serves
the
insides
of
our
--
the
linings
of
our
nose.
incidentally,
it's
also
a
very
bad
gas
too
within
that
way.
and
i
--
i
believe
the
physical
description
of
what
happened
to
these
men
in
their
own
word,
not
in
somebody
else's
words
but
in
their
own
words,
makes
it
rather
apparent
that
they
were
not
in
anyway
suffering
from
a
lack
of
oxygen
but
they
were
suffering
because
they
all
admitted
--
this
is
being
down
there
with
all
the
air
shut
off
as
a
normal
experience,
so
the
causative
factor
in
this
was
not
the
lack
of
the
oxygen
but
the
presence
of
this
alien
substance.
now,
i
may
have
aviated
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
in
that
respect
but
--
mr.
edward
w.
watson
these
facts
in
my
opinion
go
to
both.
i
mean
i
think
they
go
to
the
--
first,
to
the
negligence
question
that
there's
nothing
the
ship
could
have
done
and
the
trial
court
so
found
to
have
avoided
this
incident.
the
bin
on
the
ship
was
a
normal
beyond,
the
standard
instruction.
the
men
were
working
in
a
normal
way.
absent,
the
chloropicrin
gas,
nothing
would've
ever
happened.
we
would
never
have
heard
of
this
case.
the
fact
of
the
chloropicrin
gas
coming
off
the
grain
caused
the
incident
which
is
the
entire
basis
for
this
lawsuit.
i
believe
this
brings
us
to
the
--
what
mr.
mandell
has
called,
"the
crux
of
the
case,"
because
in
his
treatment
of
it
hand
and
our
own,
the
--
the
question
is
really
whether
the
vessel,
unable
to
control
this
situation,
unable
to
avoid
it
in
any
possible
way,
is
liable
for
an
unseaworthiness
which
arises
from
the
breach
of
a
duty.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
mr.
justice
white
that
would
not
be
the
case.
actually,
i
thought
mr.
shirley
looked
at
this
point.
he
didn't
possibly
make
it
entirely
clear.
there
was
no
inspection
being
conducted
to
determine
direct,
the
presence
of
fumigant
residuals
in
this
grain.
frankly,
i
think
the
trial
court
found
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
examine
the
grain
that
closely.
this
particular
chloropicrin
may
have
come
off
of
40
or
50
bushels
of
grain
at
the
most.
the
ship
was
loading
300
or
400,000
bushels
of
grain
at
a
very
fast
rate
from
the
elevators'
grain
spouts
leading
in
to
about
four
holes.
the
--
the
stevedore
in
charge
of
the
loading
had
the
opportunity,
as
the
record
shows,
of
cutting
off
this
flow
of
grain
if
at
anytime
the
government
inspectors
stationed
at
the
end
of
either
any
spout,
notice
the
grain
was
off-grade
in
any
way.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
would
put
a
grain
off-grade
would
not
only
be
the
mixture
but
if
it
comes
out
with
an
objectionable
odor.
in
other
words,
if
the
men
themselves
had
noticed
this
chloropicrin,
they
would
have
the
stopped
the
run
of
grain
at
the
deck
before
allowing
the
ship
to
complete.
actually,
the
--
the
manner
in
which
this
grain
is
handled
though
would
mean
that
even
if
he
called
up
to
the
elevator
and
said,
"stop
spout
number
3,"
it
takes
probably
30
minutes
--
30
seconds
to
a
minute
before
they
can
cut
the
flow
of
grain
off
at
the
elevator
house.
and
meanwhile,
whatever
effect
was
going
to
happen
to
the
men
on
this
bin
would
have
already
happened.
so
you
have
a
situation
of
something
happening
--
happening
very
suddenly
and
even
frankly,
if
they
had
known
it
was
going
to
happen,
they
couldn't
have
stopped
it
in
time.
but
the
--
going
back
to
what
mr.
mandell
calls
the
"crux
of
the
question
here"
and
i
believe
it
is
just
that.
it
is
the
question
whether
the
shipowners
warranty
extends
to
the
condition
of
the
cargo
because
from
the
view
point
of
approximate
cause,
it
was
a
condition
of
the
cargo
which
caused
the
injury
in
this
case.
and
i
think
counsel
really
conceives
that
in
his
opening
argument
to
the
court
yesterday
though
other
elements
of
the
case
are
injected.
we
always
come
back
to
this
single
question,
does
the
ship
besides
warranting
that
the
ship
itself
is
seaworthy
--
besides
warranting
that
its
appurtenances
are
seaworthy,
besides
warranting
that
its
personnel
are
fit
for
their
calling?
does
the
ship
also
warrant
that
the
cargo
which
is
being
taken
aboard
is
free
from
the
conditions
which
might
cause
harm?
and
as
stated
in
our
brief,
we
find
no
case
which
says
so.
and
if
it
is
so
held
in
this
case,
i
believe
it
would
be
an
extension
of
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
as
stated
up
to
now.
there
are
some
cases
involving
cashew
oil
liquids.
there
are
some
cases
involving
the
use
of
carbon
tetrachloride
or
the
carriage
of
carbon
tetrachloride
on
vessels.
i
believe
an
examination
of
those
cases
insofar
as
they
would
be
pertinent
here,
shows
that
--
where
liability
was
found,
it
was
rested
on
really
negligent
handling
of
a
known
dangerous
commodity.
here,
we
had
a
commodity
that
had
no
know
--
known
dangerous
characteristics
and
for
that
reason,
required
no
special
handling
but
again,
we're
getting
back
to
negligence.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
it's
a
highly
corrosive
--
mr.
edward
w.
watson
it's
a
highly
corrosive
liquid
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
corrosive.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
handling
the
importation
of
it,
the
--
the
longshoreman
customarily
wear
--
wear
gloves,
i
mean
that
are
impenetrable
to
a
corrosive
or
acid.
and
they
use
a
(inaudible)
to
causes
a
dermatitis
and
apparently
no
matter
how
it's
packaged.
if
you
handle
it,
your
skin
is
going
to
be
affected.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
and
i
believe
there
are
two
of
the
cashew
oil
cases
and
both
of
them
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
one
was
a
new
york
state
case,
one
in
federal
court,
both
of
them
rested
upon
the
question
of
failure
to
warn
the
workmen
of
the
fact
that
they
were
handling
something
that
would
cause
dermatitis
unless
they
took
a
proper
precautions.
they
--
if
the
warranty
of
a
vessel
as
to
unseaworthiness
is
to
be
so
extended,
as
counsel
would
contend
in
this
case.
it
suggests
itself
to
the
respondent
that
we
are
opening
a
door,
a
"pandora's
box"
literally,
of
all
kinds
of
--
of
complications.
to
begin
with,
it's
easy
to
see
where
the
ship's
warranty
is
confined
to
its
gear,
to
appurtenances,
its
personnel
but
this
is
going
to
be
confined
in
area
aboard
the
ship.
but
if
the
ship
is
responsible
for
any
element
within
its
cargo
that
might
cause
injury,
i
was
thinking
yesterday
when
hearing
the
argument
on
the
"twilight
zone"
cases,
where
does
this
responsibility
of
a
ship
before
its
cargo
stop?
are
we
going
to
hold
them
responsible
for
all
things
that
might
come
out
of
that
cargo,
all
conditions
even
after
the
cargo
has
been
landed
and
put
ashore
in
a
warehouse
and
the
ship
is
going
about
its
way?
or
does
the
responsibility
of
the
ship
for
the
conditions
of
that
cargo
start
when
the
ware
--
when
the
longshoreman
are
still
palletizing
the
cargo
in
the
warehouse
and
before
they'd
even
come
near
the
--
the
ship's
tackle,
if
it
is
under
the
ship's
warranty
of
course
that
thing,
the
thing
that
we
would
properly
dispute.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
this
accident
mr.
chief
justice
was
under
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
which
are,
i
believe
well-supported
in
the
evidence,
due
to
the
carelessness
of
a
party
unknown
at
some
inland
elevator.
the
ability
to
trace
back
to
that
party
being
wiped
out
in
the
way
the
grain
in
bulk
is
handled
and
then
received
in
the
elevator
in
its
identity
lost.
this
does
not
mean,
however,
that
the
injured
workman
have
or
--
or
without
a
remedy
because
obviously,
the
--
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
worker's
compensation
act
was
designed
to
cover
some
responsibility
to
give
them
some
protection
in
some
area.
they
have
new
opportunities
for
recovery
in
many
areas.
but
here,
in
our
position,
is
an
area
where
they
have
the
benefit
of
the
compensation
law
in
a
proper
field,
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
compensation
law
was
designed
for
where
you
cannot
put
the
finger
on
a
fault
or
even
a
breach
of
a
warranty
because
we
say
the
warranty
was
not
there.
so
here,
it's
clearly
a
proper
place
for
the
compensation
law
is
such
to
operate.
but
it
would
also
occur
to
us
that
if
the
warranty
of
the
--
of
seaworthiness
or
reasonable
fitness
is
to
be
extend
to
a
condition
of
a
cargo,
that
immediately
you
have
start
making
new
categories.
you
might
have
a
cargo
that
was
inherently
dangerous
and
the
injury
consequent
on
a
condition
of
that
inherently
dangerous
characteristic.
now,
that
might
be
your
cashew
oil
liquid
cases.
or
you
might
have
a
cargo
not
inherently
dangerous
but
the
injury
from
a
normal
condition
of
that
cargo
and
that,
i
would
suggest
might
be
comparable
in
a
way
to
the
mitchell
case.
then
you'd
have
another
category
of
a
cargo
not
inherently
dangerous
and
the
injury
resulting
from
an
abnormal
condition.
that
i
think
is
the
case
we
had
here.
in
other
words,
grain,
wheat
is
a
staple,
it
meets
certain
standards,
it's
trade.
i
believe
the
figures
show
that
this
particular
export
elevator
handled
300
--
i
mean,
30
million
bushels
a
year
of
these
commodities
of
this
type.
it's
in
world
trade.
it's
standardized
by
various
governmental
agencies.
it's
not
regarded
as
being
a
dangerous
commodity.
it's
the
source
of
bread.
certainly,
the
condition
of
this
particular
grain
which
produced
the
injuries
complained
here
was
a
very
abnormal
condition,
not
to
be
expected
despite
these
three
prior
incidents
of
some
years
previously
because
it
really
wasn't
in
the
final
analysis
in
the
same
category
of
those
incidents.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
you
mean
that
chlorinated
hydrocarbon?
mr.
edward
w.
watson
that
has
a
toxic
effect
on
the
liver,
if
inhaled
in
sufficient
quantities.
if
the
--
the
greatest
damage
seems
to
be
done
in
the
--
in
the
chronic
cases
where
you
inhale
chlorinated
hydrocarbon
consistently
over
a
period
of
time
rather
than
in
--
in
the
--
in
acute
cases
where
you
have
a
very
strong
inhalation
but
only
a
single
inhalation.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
the
chlorinated
hydrocarbon
is
the
base
of
the
weevil
side
which
is
used
in
the
grain
elevator
but
which
--
or
at
least
four
years
prior
to
this
incident
had
been
used
under
a
very
tight
control.
now
on
the
ships
sometimes,
they
fumigate
aboard
the
ships.
and
when
they
fumigate
aboard
the
ships
themselves,
this
did
not
happen
here,
but
then
again
they
--
they
used
a
cyanide
gas
type
of
fumigant.
and
the
court
may
recall
in
the
petitions
for
certiorari,
both
of
them
in
this
case,
some
pictures
were
attached
to
floors
that
were
being
used
on
a
ship.
these
were
being
used
to
clear
this
kind
of
a
gas
out
of
the
ship.
obviously,
i
mean
when
cyanide
has
been
used,
you
can't
work
for
its
bin
until
the
whole
atmosphere
has
been
well-purified
and
oxygen
restored.
we
submit
that
those
pictures
in
the
evidence
relating
to
the
use
of
blowers
to
get
cyanide
gas
out
of
a
ship
has
no
relation
to
this
case
because
blowers
of
that
kind
are
never
used
to
air
a
grain
in
the
first
instance
and
the
ship
here
was
not
fumigated
at
any
stage
of
the
proceeding
in
the
second,
so
were
not
concerned
with
that
aspect.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
mr.
chief
justice,
you
mean
a
chlorinated
hydrocarbon?
mr.
edward
w.
watson
i
believe
this
information
would
have
come
to
the
various
grain
inspectors
and
there's
several
--
there's
a
federal
inspector
and
is
a
local
board
of
trade
inspector.
only
incidentally
to
their
examination
of
the
grain
for
all
kinds
of
purposes
to
determine
whether
weevils
were
in
it,
to
determine
whether
there's
any
foreign
matter,
to
grade
it,
to
determine
how
many
kernels
of
this
kind,
how
many
kernels
of
that
kind
or
to
determine
whether
it
had
any
commercially
objectionable
foreign
odors.
but
it's
pointed
out
by
mr.
shirley
--
mr.
edward
w.
watson
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
no
chemist.
i
only
remember
what
these
men
said.
i
believe
of
course
that
it
would
be
practical
to
test
for
almost
anything.
but
to
test
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
this
kind
of
incident
would
have
required
almost
a
bushel-by-bushel
inspection
of
the
grain
and
when
you're
handling
400,000
bushels
of
grain,
loading
that
much
aboard
a
ship
in
a
day
and
a
half
and
trimming
it
out,
i
question
as
the
court
--
trial
court
questioned
whether
there's
any
practical
means
of
--
of
finding
this
out.
actually,
i
think
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court
was
--
was
unnecessary
to
find
this
out.
this
is
a
kind
of
thing
you
take
precautions
for
and
actually,
the
precautions
against
the
presence
of
chlorinated
hydrocarbons
were
--
were
worked
in
this
case.
there's
no
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
any
chlorinated
hydrocarbons
in
the
grian.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
say
and
this
is,
i
believe
not
in
the
record
and
i
hate
to
depart
from
the
record.
but
i
--
i
mean
i
have
known
in
these
other
instances
where
a
grain
that
had
been
fumigated
was
found
aboard
a
vessel
and
the
workmen
were
pulled
off
the
job.
i
think
the
zosianne
case
was
an
example
of
that
type.
but
before
the
workman
ever
go
back
to
the
job,
the
chemist
go
in
and
they
not
only
test
the
atmosphere
above
the
grain
but
they
make
probes
into
the
grain
to
make
sure
there's
not
a
--
a
latent
gas
there
that
maybe
released
as
the
grain
is
stirred
up
for
the
trimming
process.
but
that
is
the
only
instance
i
believe
that
i
can
recall.
i'm
sure
other
counsel
can
recall
where
this
kind
of
work
is
done.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
i
think
that
would
completely
change
the
complexion
of
this
case
mr.
justice
white.
i
mean
if
the
city
had
fumigated
the
grain
without
putting
the
ship
on
notice
that
it
had
fumigated
the
grain,
i
think
mr.
shirley
and
i
would
be
adversaries
here
as
well
as
sitting
on
the
same
side
of
the
table.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
it
would
have
been
--
well,
somebody
would
have
been
responsible
in
negligence
if
the
city
had
fumigated
the
grain
and
knew
that
fumigated
grain
was
being
loaded
aboard
this
vessel
and
either
did
not
issue
the
proper
warnings
and
make
proper
tests
themselves
or
else
did
not
advise
the
ship
so
the
ship
could
have
issued
the
warnings
and
made
them
--
mr.
edward
w.
watson
i
believe
not
mr.
justice
because
i
think
--
i
think
the
liability
there
would
be
rested
on
--
on
principles
of
notice
or
constructive
notice
which
of
course
would
take
the
case
back
into
the
area
of
negligence.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
that's
exactly
it
really.
i
think
that's
what
happened,
i
mean
and
i
think
there's
nothing
that
could've
been
done
to
avoid
that
in
the
manner
in
which
the
ships
are
handled,
the
manner
in
which
these
men
have
to
work.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
sir?
mr.
edward
w.
watson
this
case
in
--
in
my
opinion
sir
would
be
like
trawler
racer.
if
you
change
the
facts
of
mitchell,
the
racer
case,
and
had
the
seaman
there,
we'll
say
perhaps
as
they
are
hauling
this
catch
of
fish
in
over
the
side
of
the
vessel
out
of
sea
at
an
earlier
stage
of
the
voyage,
if
he
had
encountered
a
ship
--
an
unusual
species
of
fish
where
a
spine
that
was
poisonous
to
him
and
had
it
gotten
an
infected
hand
as
a
consequence.
i
mean
this
to
me
would
make
--
if
that
was
the
mitchell
case
then
that
would
be
our
case
or
another
--
another
analogy
might
be
that
one
of
the
fish
that
they
brought
aboard
the
racer
while
still
out
at
sea,
had
--
had
a
previous
encounter
with
some
other
fisherman
and
came
away
with
a
big
hook
still
in
the
fish
and
perhaps
while
he's
gutting
the
fish
and
creating
this
gurry
and
slime
for
the
rail,
he
--
that's
happened
to
me
or
at
all
fishermen,
he
encountered
this
alien
hook,
they
would
have
no
reason
to
suspect
it
was
present
in
this
fish.
that
kind
of
a
situation,
if
that
had
been
the
situation
in
mitchell,
would
i
think
make
it
like
this
case.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
an
unseaworthy
fish
your
honor,
yes
sir.
the
--
but
to
me,
there's
--
it
also
as
to
be
noticed
in
--
in
the
mitchell
case
that
while
this
court
has
said
that
this
was
a
transitory
thing
that
notice
was
not
necessary,
yet
the
owner
of
the
trawler
racer
did
not
have
to
have
notice,
i
mean
because
the
condition
that
was
encountered
by
mitchell
was
a
normal
byproduct
of
the
way
the
ship
was
being
used.
now,
the
condition
that
was
encountered
by
morales
and
the
others
was
not
a
normal
byproduct
of
the
way
the
ship
was
being
used.
and
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
since
the
mitchell
case
was
decided
here
and
the
cases
prior
to
mitchell,
where
juries
have
been
instructed
in
the
terms
of
the
mitchell
case,
and
they
have
not
always
found
unseaworthiness
merely
because
a
condition
was
transitory
or
they
have
not
always
found
unseaworthiness
merely
because
an
accident
happened.
there
is
still
this
question
of
reasonable
fitness
for
unintended
use.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
it
was
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i've
always
been
interested
in
what
happened
then
but
i
don't
know.
mr.
edward
w.
watson
no,
it
was
a
question
of
instruction,
an
erroneous
instruction
having
been
given
the
jury
and
i
believe
that
is
similar
to
the
situation
found
on
the
other
cases
cited
by
the
petitioners
here.
of
course,
that
is
the
end
of
my
argument
sir.
