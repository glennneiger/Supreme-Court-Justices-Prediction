the

judge

didn't

well,
mr.
shirley.
justice
william

did
the
city
know
that
the
grain
was
frequently
fumigated
at
in
--
at
in
--
at
in
an
inland
point?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
didn't
know
that
it
was
improperly
fumigated?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
did
know
that
those
were
fumigated
at
inland
point?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
in
the
previous
incidents
in
which
the
city
had
fumigated
and
it
caused
some
trouble,
was
the
cure
for
the
trouble
of
system
of
inspections?
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
was
it
the
grain
come
from
so
far
away
that
a
normal
fumigation
would
automatically
have
eliminated
any
danger
with
the

kind
of
grain
arrived
--
justice
william

douglas
--
at
the
city?
justice
william
o.
douglas
none
of
it
came
--
and
none
of
it
came
from
such
a
short
distance
that
--
that
the
72
hours
would
not

come.
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
watson.
justice
william
o.
douglas
before
you
leave
this
other
point,
previous
incidents
had
indicated
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
even
if
the
grain
is
fumigated
at
the
--
in
the
elevator
by
the
city
that
the
fumigant
may
linger
and
you
could
have
some
trouble
in
the
hold
of
the
ship.
and
i
gather
that
some
inspection
routine
and
other
controls
were
instituted
to
control
this
matter.
and
in
any
event,
the
inspection
routine
was
setup
for
the
purpose
of
detecting
whether
or
not
there
was
any
excessive
residue
of
fumigant.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
would
it
make
any
difference
if
--
if
in
this
case,
the
fumigation
had
been
done
by
the
city,
would
you
still
make
the
same
argument?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
how
about
--
how
about
your
argument
of
unseaworthiness?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
would
that
change
your
argument
on
unseaworthiness?
