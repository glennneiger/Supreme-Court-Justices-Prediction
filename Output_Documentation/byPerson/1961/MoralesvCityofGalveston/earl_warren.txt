robert

et

appellant,
versus
city

et

mr.
shirley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shirley,
where
is
the
--
where
is
the
first
inspection
made
for
--
knock
this
gases
odorous?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
--
they
made
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
that
purpose
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
primarily
for
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
grade.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
mr.
shirley,
what
--
what
happens
besides
putting
it
on
the
record,
if
anything,
when
they
find
not
just
odors
on
this
first
inspection
while
it's
on
the
car.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
mr.
mandell
to
say
yesterday
that
--
that
the
city
did
have
knowledge
of
these
three
that
you
have
mentioned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
case,
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
what
i
--
what
i
--
i'm
not
quite
clear.
i
was
trying
to
--
to
connect
up
these
other
three
accidents
that
you
mentioned
just
a
moment.
did
the
court
find
that
they
did
have
knowledge
of
those
or
did
not
have
knowledge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
knowledge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
answered
my
questions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
did
it
come
from
mr.
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
watson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
--
was
it
closed?
was
the
opening
closed
on
these
men?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
answer
is
yes
to
my
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
reason
i
asked
that
question,
i
want
to
follow
that
up
with
the
--
well
another
and
i
was
going
to
ask
you
if
it
might
not
be
that
--
that
the
closing
of
this
airspace
would
cause
the
toxic
effect
to
be
greater
than
just
what
--
what
you
said,
that
it
was
at
as
it
was
passing
down
the
shoot.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
this
argument
go
to
negligence
or
unseaworthiness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
what
the
--
what
the
known
dangerous
element
of
cashew
oil
is,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
corrosive.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask,
who,
if
anyone
would
be
responsible
for
this
condition,
for
this
accident?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
to
say,
if
this
had
been
the
other
kind
of
chloride
that
it
probably
would
have
killed
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
--
that
is
used
on
occasions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
inspection
made
by
the
city
or
the
ship
or
anybody
else
to
see
whether
that
kind
of
a
chemical
was
used
in
this
--
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
test
that
could
be
made
to
--
reasonably
be
made
to
determine
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
true
but
the
--
but
the
ship
wasn't
custom
to
--
to
taking
on
--
taking
on
grain
and
filling
in
this
manner,
sometimes
closing
the
--
the
air
shaft
and
one
would
think
that
perhaps
there
ought
to
be
some
test
that
men
were
going
supposed
to
be
going
into
that
bin,
there
might
be
some
test
that
would
be
given
to
determine
whether
it
was
safe
for
them
to
do
it.
that
was
the
reason
of
my
question
here.

justice
