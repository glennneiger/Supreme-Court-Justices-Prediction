if
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
understood
that
the
respondents
said
they
were
taken
by
surprise
in
this
matter
that
they
--
that
the
administrative
practice
was
contrary
to
this
regulation
that
you
mentioned
and
that
they
--
they
had
never
been
required
to
pay
this
tax
until
after
their
--
after
the
antitrust
suit
against
the
--
against
the
seamen
and
as
if
wondering
why
that
was
the
practice
since
1940
that
they
only
knew
about
it,
at
that
late
date.
chief

warren
well,
i
--
i
--
i
thought
also
that
the
position
of
the
parties
is
reversed
in
this
case
that
in
the
antitrust
case,
i
understood
that
they
claim
they
were
employees
and
therefore
they
were
not
violating
antitrust
and
the
government
contended
that
they
were
--
that
they
were
not
and
now
the
situation
is
exactly
reversed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.

mr.
oberdorfer,
before
i
forget
it
and
because
it
isn't
in
your
brief,
i
wonder
if
you
would
submit
a
short
memorandum
concerning
this
--
this
regulation
that
you
have
mentioned,
387
and
--
and
also
the
administrative
practice
under
it
and
counsel
you
may
reply
to
it
of
course.

chief

if
we
accept
that
fact,
is
that
all
there
is
to
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
were
not
a
party
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
antitrust
suit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
the
added
factor
in
--
in
the
nut
margarine
case
was
there
not?
the
government
had
loss
in
--
in
identical
situations?
chief
justice

warren
mr.
morse.
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
it
be
a
rather
late
restriction
on
7421
(a)
that
--
that
any
taxpayer
could
go
into
court
to
merely
claim
that
this
tax
was
illegally
assessed
and
that
it
would
bankrupt
him
if
he
had
--
had
to
pay
it
and
then
be
entitled
to
a
preliminary
injunction
to
prevent
the
commissioner
from
collecting
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
oberdorfer.
