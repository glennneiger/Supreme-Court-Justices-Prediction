mr.
george
e.
morse
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
feel
that
the
vital
facts
in
this
case
at
this
point
are
that
williams
packing
&
navigation
company
did
not
owe
a
tax
in
the
amount
of
$41,000
which
was
assessed
against
it.
that
is
a
finding
of
fact
which
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
justice
--
judge
reeves
did
not
touch
upon
in
his
dissent,
his
dissent
is
confined
to
procedural
problems.
and
that
it
is
binding
upon
the
government
on
this
appeal
and
therefore
it
should
be
accepted
as
a
fact
that
williams
packing
&
navigation
company
was
assessed
with
a
tax
which
he
did
not
owe.
the
government
characterizes
that
tax
at
this
point
as
erroneous.
we
think
that
it
was
illegal.
but
as
whether
it
was
erroneous
or
illegal,
we
think
that
that
is
merely
a
quibble
and
semantics
that
it
was
a
tax
which
was
not
owed
by
our
client.
mr.
george
e.
morse
no
sir
that
is
not
because
i'll
proceed
to
the
next
point
and
that
is
an
equitable
consideration
which
was
considered
by
the
court
in
the
miller
case.
and
that
is
that
the
payment
of
the
assessment
would
have
wrecked
and
ruin
the
corporation.
now,
we
were
not
complaining
in
the
lower
court
that
the
payment
of
social
security
taxes
on
men
in
the
future
would
ruin
our
business.
we
did
not
say
that
to
the
lower
court.
we
said
that
the
assessment
is
so
large
and
the
corporation
that
this
time
is
a
deficit
corporation
that
we
simply
cannot
pay
the
full
amount
in
order
to
sue
and
have
a
determination
of
the
liability.
and
therefore,
the
court
should
give
us
the
equitable
consideration
of
enjoining
the
attempted
or
the
prospective
assessment
in
collection
of
this
tax
and
permit
us
to
litigate
the
liability
per
se
without
having
to
pay
it.
we
say
sir
that
the
remedy
--
the
only
remedy
in
such
taxes
as
this,
provided
by
congress
and
we're
in
agreement
with
this,
with
the
government
on
this,
that
you
must
pay
the
full
amount,
file
a
claim
for
refund
and
sue
to
get
it
back
in
order
to
have
the
liability
per
se
litigated.
except
for
the
fact
that
we
think
that
miller
stands
for
an
exception
where
the
payment
of
the
assessment
would
be
ruinous
on
the
plaintiff
or
the
respondent
or
the
perspective
taxpayer.
mr.
george
e.
morse
sir?
mr.
george
e.
morse
well,
i
say
and
we
discuss
in
our
brief
this
flora
case,
this
footnote.
of
course
the
flora
case
didn't
decide
that
--
it
was
decided
exactly
to
the
contrary.
our
search
of
the
footnote
37
and
38
and
other
decided
decisions
has
not
given
us
any
indication,
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed,
that
there
was
a
judicial
determination
or
an
administrative
determination
that
such
a
remedy
was
available
to
us
at
the
time.
and
nor
did
i
think
today
that
there
is
one,
nor
do
i
think
that
the
government
is
now
contending
that
this
court
should
adjudicate
that
we
have
one
at
that
time
because
the
government
merely
passes
in
the
statement
of
its
case
in
the
brief
on
the
flora
decisions
saying,
"inferentially,
you
had
the
right
to
pay
$2000
and
sue
to
get
it
back."
but
the
government
does
not
develop
in
that
argue
--
that
statement
in
its
argument
of
the
case
and
in
no
way
do
i
see,
i
asked
this
court
to
reverse
this
case
on
that
point.
we
say
with
respect
to
that
sir,
that
while
the
government
says
that
perhaps
we
were
not
as
imaginative
as
we
should
have
been
nor
were
they
perhaps
as
imaginative
as
they
should
have
been.
that
route
was
not
available
to
us
because
it
is
a
flexible
position.
the
government
can
move,
if
you
sue
or
to
get
an
injunction,
the
government
can
say,
“no,
you
pay
a
quarter."
if
you
pay
the
quarter,
the
government
says,
“no,
you
must
pay
the
full
amount.”
so
we
say
that
is
not
a
clear,
adequate
and
plain
remedy
at
law.
mr.
george
e.
morse
no,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morse
sir,
i'm
speaking
--
i
thought
you
--
of
the
trial
as
it
proceeded.
was
there
an
affirmative
statement
in
the
pleadings
by
the
government
that
we
could
pay
less
than
the
full
amount?
there
was
not.
there
was
no
position
urged
by
the
government.
mr.
george
e.
morse
well,
i
take
it
sir
that
mr.
oberdorfer
and
i
recall
his
statement
on
that.
it
is
a
concession
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
that
perhaps
two
years
ago
we
might
have
done
that.
it
is
the
first
time
that
that
concession,
to
my
knowledge,
has
been
made
in
this
particular
case.
certainly,
in
future
cases,
i
will
be
as
imaginative
that
he
says
i
was
not
then
but
i
--
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
george
e.
morse
sir?
mr.
george
e.
morse
no,
sir,
the
tax
has
not
been
paid.
the
$41,000
--
sir?
mr.
george
e.
morse
that's
right,
sir.
that
is
right,
the
same
position.
now,
i
would
say
this
that
i
don't
know
what
this
regulation
that
mr.
oberdorfer
decided
to
have.
i
would
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
file
a
reply
brief
to
that.
i
would
say
this
though,
that
in
the
biloxi-gulfport
and
pascagoula
area
where
this
case
arose,
there
did
occurred
a
case
in
which
the
united
states
government
imposed
the
sanctions
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
against
the
union
which
was
composed
of
mostly
the
fisherman
and
both
captains
and
crews
in
and
about
biloxi.
that
is
the
antitrust
case
which
the
chief
justice
commented
on
a
moment
ago.
in
that
case,
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
prove
that
the
men
were
not
the
employees
or
the
packers
to
whom
they
sold
their
product.
the
union
on
the
other
hand
contended
that
they
were.
the
government
was
successful
in
its
prosecution
of
the
union
before
a
jury.
the
jury
determined
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
instructions
from
the
lower
court
that
the
captains
and
members
of
the
crew
were
not
employees
at
the
persons
to
whom
they
sold
their
product.
now,
that
occurred
in
the
neighborhood
where
this
case
occurred.
this
case
and
at
no
doubt,
the
court
can
understand
if
the
antitrust
case
generated
considerable
interest
in
the
packing
industry
in
and
about
biloxi
where
this
case
arose.
and
that
was
the
position
taken
by
the
government
which
was
direct
--
directly
contrary.
we
contend
to
the
position
which
they
took
when
they
investigated
the
affairs
of
williams
packing
&
navigation
company
and
subsequently
arrived
at
a
$41,000
assessment.
we
think
that
that
is
an
equitable
consideration
rather
it
can
to
the
equitable
considerations
in
miller
where
the
government
had
taken
--
had
taken
positions
and
had
lost
their
positions
in
that
case.
the
government,
in
our
case
took
positions
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
they
now
take.
and
while
we
understand
that
it's
probably
not
the
law
of
the
case,
the
(inaudible)
association
will
not
be
the
law
of
the
case
in
this
case.
it
was
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
define
this
relationship,
which
is
after
all
is
the
crux
of
this
lawsuit.
mr.
george
e.
morse
sir?
mr.
george
e.
morse
no,
sir,
that,
we
were
not.
that
was
between
the
government
and
the
association.
mr.
george
e.
morse
however,
as
i
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
president
of
the
respondent
here
was
called
as
a
witness
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
which
ultimately
indicted
the
union.
mr.
george
e.
morse
sir?
mr.
george
e.
morse
the
antitrust
case,
as
i
recall,
occurred
about
1953.
the
reported
decision
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
that
date
as
i
recall,
so
that
our
tax
years
involved
here
to
some
extent
overlap
that
procedure
in
the
antitrust
suit.
now
sir,
at
this
point,
we
have
this,
summing
up
briefly
but
not
in
inclusion.
we
have
a
respondent
which
conceded
now
by
the
government
does
not
owe
a
$41,000
tax,
did
not
owe
it.
the
fact
showed
it,
the
district
court
found
it,
the
court
of
appeals
had
found
it.
secondly,
the
tax,
we
have
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
lower
court
which
is
not
urged
to
be
reversed
before
this
court
that
the
payment
of
the
assessment
of
$41,000
would
have
wrecked
and
ruined
the
taxpayer.
third,
we
have
inconsistent
actions
taken
on
the
part
of
the
government
with
respect
to
the
relationship
which
as
i
said
is
the
crux
of
the
matter
in
this
lawsuit.
those
things
were
considered
in
miller
to
be
material
to
--
for
a
showing
other
request
for
equitable
relief.
we
have
this
and
further,
the
government
says
if
they
take
--
they
took
the
position
that
they
would
consent
to
the
issuance
of
a
temporary
restraining
order.
the
complaint
in
this
case
doesn't
pray
for
temporary
restraining
order,
it
prayed
for
preliminary
injunction
and
the
government,
we
take
the
position,
consented
to
the
issuance
of
this
temporary
injunction.
now,
the
government
takes
position
in
their
brief
that
this
procedure
places
the
orderly
collection
of
taxes
in
jeopardy.
if
that
is
so,
then
they
could
resist
the
issuance
of
the
temporary
injunction
or
should
have
done
so
at
the
time
the
request
was
made,
and
we
feel
again
as
another
equitable
consideration
that
it
then
moves
the
government
to
complain
now
that
our
action,
our
suit,
interfered
with
the
orderly
collection
of
revenue
when
they
neither
resisted
the
issuance
of
the
temporary
injunction
nor
did
they
consent
to
it
but
that
the
u.s.
attorneys
in
jackson,
acting
on
orders
of
the
department
of
justice
in
washington,
told
the
court
that
we
(inaudible)
needed
to
resist
nor
denied.
i
believe
--
mr.
george
e.
morse
that
is
true,
the
government
had
loss.
i
would
say
this.
i
have
obtained
the
fifth
circuit's
record
in
the
miller
case
to
find
out
just
what
went
on
in
the
lower
court
in
that
case.
i
don't
know
what
the
record
before
this
court
contained.
it
may
have
contained
less.
but
the
miller
case
presented
a
rather
lengthy
bill
of
complaint
in
which
these
cases
which
the
government
had
lost
are
set
forth
and
they're
copied
(inaudible).
they're
just
---
the
decision
and
the
opinions
are
written
out
in
the
complaint.
and
in
the
miller
case,
the
lower
court
considered
the
--
whether
or
not
the
bill
stated
the
cause
of
action
and
said
that
it
did.
in
the
miller
case,
the
government
took
the
position
and
denied
that
the
particular
nut
product
was
not
manufactured
in
the
way
which
the
complainant
said
it
was.
and
so
we
had
an
issue
of
fact
after
the
court
determined
that
the
complaint
stated
a
cause
of
action.
the
court
took
proof
on
an
issue
of
fact,
the
issues
of
the
evidence
being
run,
how
the
product
was
manufactured.
the
ingredients
that
went
into
the
product,
was
it
churned
with
milk
or
was
it
churned
with
butter?
why
was
it
wrapped
in
one
pound
cartons
and
divided
into
quarter
pound
sticks?
was
it
not
sold,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
sold
as
a
substitute
for
butter?
these
were
factual
issues
which
i
contend
were
closely
and
hotly
litigated
in
miller.
and
the
court
--
the
lower
court
determined
those
issues
against
the
government
and
found
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
product
was
not
taxable.
now,
the
statements
with
respect
to
whether
the
issuance
of
the
tax
or
the
--
levy
of
the
tax
in
miller
was
arbitrary,
capricious
and
so
on,
i
submit,
are
made
from
the
vantage
point
of
hindsight
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
miller
case
that
we
there
dealt
with
a
vengeful
collector
who
is
out
to
break
the
company.
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
was
acting
completely
at
bad
faith.
and
what
this
court
said
in
the
miller
case
was
"that
the
assessment
was
illegal,"
and
then
went
on
to
say,
"and
to
apply
these
additives,
it
was
so
illegal
as
to
appear
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious."
as
i
understand
the
government's
position
in
this
case,
our
case
should
fail
because
the
assessment
does
not
appear
affirmatively
to
be
arbitrary,
capricious
or
proceed
from
a
sentence
to
motive.
and
our
answer
to
that
is
the
majority
opinion
in
allen
versus
regents
case
decided
subsequent
to
the
miller
case
in
which
this
court
passed
upon
the
procedural
--
two
things,
passed
upon
the
procedural
right
of
the
regents
of
georgia
to
attack
the
validity
of
an
assessment
through
the
injunctive
route.
and
the
second
point
was
whether
or
not
that
subject
tax
was
a
burden
on
a
governmental
function
of
the
state
of
georgia.
and
in
that
case,
the
regents
won
in
the
court
below
and
when
it
came
to
this
court,
these
two
things
were
passed
upon,
the
government
urged
first
of
all,
in
the
regents
that
we
should
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
tax
was
a
burden
on
a
governmental
function,
because
the
lower
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
suit.
we
shouldn't
even
reach
that,
which
they
are
doing
here.
they
are
arguing
that
here.
this
court
held
that
it
was
proper,
under
the
unusual
circumstances
existed
in
that
case
to
proceed
the
--
by
the
injunctive
route
and
then
went
on
the
whole
that
the
tax
was
not
a
burden
on
a
governmental
function.
so
we
submit
to
the
court
that
reading
miller
together
with
allen
versus
board
of
regents,
that
this
was
a
proper
procedure
given
the
unusual
circumstances
which
we
have
in
this
case.
but
that's
not
all,
a
ruinous
tax
consent
by
the
government
to
this
procedure
try
inconsistent
proceedings
taken
by
the
government.
no
clear
adequate
remedy
at
law.
we
state
the
question
a
little
differently
at
this
point,
as
whether
financial
ruin
is
the
only
alternative
open
to
the
respondent
against
to
which
the
government
assessed
to
threaten
to
collect
a
tax
which
it
did
not
owe.
the
government
and
we
recognize
that
the
taxes
keep
this
country
going
that
they
should
be
paid
and
we
should
follow
order
--
normally
follow
the
statutory
routes
open
to
us.
the
government
agrees
with
us,
i
believe,
and
does
not
now
urge
that
miller
be
reversed,
but
the
government
agrees
that
miller
is
an
exception
to
the
no
injunction
statute.
we
had
another
one.
we
had
allen
versus
board
of
regents
as
another
exception.
and
we
say
this,
that
while
congress
has
not
provided
a
clear
adequate
remedy
in
cases
such
as
this
for
us
to
proceed
without
the
payment
of
the
full
tax
equity,
the
conscious
of
the
sovereign
will
not
permit
an
unconscionable
wrong
to
be
done
and
we
submit
that
it
would
have
been
an
unconscionable
wrong
for
the
district
court
to
dismiss
this
case
at
the
threshold
and
not
even
reach
the
ultimate
fact
of
whether
or
not
our
client
owed
the
tax.
we
submit
that
within
the
equitable
con
--
jurisprudence
that
the
lower
court
had
the
right
to
accept
this
case,
take
it
into
the
bosom
of
the
court
particularly
when
the
government
consented
to
this
route,
determine
the
ultimate
facts,
decide
it
whether
or
not
we
owed
the
tax
and
permanently
enjoined
the
government,
not
withstanding
the
no
injunction
statute.
we
submit
that
the
case
should
be
a
finding.
mr.
george
e.
morse
yes
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morse
i
think
it
--
i
agree
with
the
court
that
it
would
and
it
has
been
attempted
many
times
and
in
some
cases,
particularly
social
security
case
--
cases.
the
court
has
done
this,
the
lower
courts
have
entertained
jurisdiction
to
determine
if
in
truth
and
fact
what
this
taxpayer
says
is
true,
will
it
wreck
and
ruin
him?
does
he
owe
it?
now
so,
i
think
that
it
is
--
unless
congress
wants
to
do
otherwise,
the
congress
can
trust
to
the
judiciary
that
it's
going
to
act
for
the
betterment
of
the
government.
it's
going
to
follow
the
law,
the
court
will.
but
the
courts
should
have
this
escape
that
they
will
not
commit
an
unconscionable
wrong.
now,
i
don't
see
where,
as
the
court
stated
the
question
to
me,
whether
there
is
any
great
danger
to
the
collection
for
the
revenue.
i
believe
that
if
congress
considers
that
that's
the
danger
in
social
security
and
unemployment
taxes,
congress
may
give
us
a
remedy
to
pay
less
than
the
full
amount
in
cases
such
as
this.
in
some
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court,
in
excised
tax
cases,
i
don't
know
if
it
comes
to
this
court,
but
the
taxpayers
only
paid
$50
in
order
to
litigate
the
rights.
we
would
have
had
to
pay
$41,000
when
the
assets
of
the
company
taken
at
best
for
only
$20,000.
we
submit
its
an
unusual
circumstance
and
that
is
the
controlling
facts,
unless
the
other
questions
are
(inaudible).
