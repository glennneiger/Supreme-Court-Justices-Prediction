mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
application
of
section
7421
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
provides
very
simply
and
very
sharply
that
no
suit
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
the
assessment
or
collection
of
any
tax
shall
be
maintained
in
any
court.
the
question
precisely
here
is
whether
in
the
face
of
the
statute,
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
restrain
as
it
did
restrain
the
director
of
internal
revenue
from
the
collection
from
the
taxpayer
of
a
duly
assessed
social
security
and
unemployment
compensation
tax,
actually
the
tax
for
several
years.
on
account
of
services
according
to
the
theory
of
the
assessment,
rendered
by
captains
and
crews
operating
shrimp
boats
owned
or
leased
by
the
taxpayers,
that
is
they
either
own
them
or
lease
them
from
a
related
partnership
and
then
made
available
by
a
legal
relation
which
is
in
dispute
to
the
captains
and
crews
to
operate
them
and
fish
from
them
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
that
court
by
a
vote
of
two
to
one
with
judge
reeves'
dissenting
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
which
had
entered
the
injunction.
the
injunction
had
been
entered
after
a
protracted
hearing
on
the
merits
the
--
the
final
injunction
had
been
preceded
by
a
preliminary
injunction
and
a
restraining
order.
the
issue
between
the
director
and
the
taxpayer
arose
by
or
initially
and
at
the
administrative
level
by
an
assessment
made
by
the
district
director
through
appropriate
agents.
the
district
director
examined
the
taxpayer's
books,
had
discussions
with
taxpayer's
officers,
and
according
to
the
record,
investigated
by
interrogating
captains
and
crews
in
the
area.
after
having
made
this
determination
that
the
tax
was
due,
the
taxpayer
filed
a
claim
through
the
administrative
review
process
to
abate
the
tax.
this
claim
for
abatement
was
considered
and
the
order
of
the
--
or
--
or
letter
of
the
appellate
division
refusing
to
abate
the
taxes
in
the
record.
the
order
recites
that
the
information
offered
by
the
taxpayers
in
support
of
his
claim
from
abatement
was
considered
and
was
respectfully
--
the
claim
was
respectfully
denied.
within
a
very
short
time,
four
or
five
days
after
receipt
of
the
letter
of
determination
denying
the
claim
for
abatement,
the
taxpayer,
and
this
was
before
there
had
been
any
notice
or
demand
which
is
a
condition
predicate
to
seizure
and
restraint,
before
any
notice
of
demand,
before
any
collection
action
had
occurred
insofar
as
the
record
shows,
so
far
as
we
know,
before
any
collection
action
had
been
attempted,
the
taxpayer
filed
a
complaint
for
an
injunction
and
for
preliminary
injunction.
the
district
--
the
district
court
granted
a
preliminary
injunction
that
it
was
pending
before
the
motion
for
restraining
order,
the
united
states
attorney
was
authorized
to
go
into
our
practice
not
to
either
agree
or
disagree
to
the
entering
or
entry
of
restraining
order
until
we
could
find
the
facts.
in
any
event,
the
court
had
a
preliminary
injunction
also
without
--
at
that
point
without
really
hearing
--
hearing
any
evidence
or
having
made
the
--
any
findings
that
the
action
of
the
director
in
making
this
assessment
were
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
otherwise
susceptible
to
an
equitable
remedy.
this
assessment
was
run
--
the
--
the
--
the
case
came
on
for
hearing
and
issue
was
joined
as
raised
in
the
pleadings.
the
complaint
had
alleged
that
the
taxpayer
would
be
put
out
of
business
by
collection
of
the
tax
and
alleged
essentially
that
the
tax
was
illegal
because
the
individuals
with
respect
to
whom
social
security
and
withholding
tax
--
social
security
and
unemployment
compensation
tax
was
being
paid
or
not
as
a
matter
of
law
employees
and
the
case
was
tried
and
the
record
shows
--
the
case
was
tried
on
two
issues.
the
--
the
legal
issue
of
whether
or
not
as
a
matter
of
law,
these
employees
were
employees,
the
government
contending.
first
of
all,
the
taxpayer
contending
that
because
there
was
--
that
because
the
--
the
so-called
employees
were
compensated
on
a
share
basis
instead
of
being
paid
regular
wages
when
the
ship
--
when
the
boat
came
in,
the
catch
was
sold
and
the
proceeds
of
the
catch
were
divided
amongst
the
captain
and
the
crew
and
the
owner
of
the
boat.
and
this,
according
to
the
taxpayer,
distinguished
the
relationship
between
the
boat
owner
and
the
crews
and
captain
from
the
relationship
of
employer-employee.
the
government
of
course
contended
that
although
the
method
of
compensation
was
unique
in
a
sense
that
it
was
traditional
to
this
industry,
it
was
ultimately
the
kind
of
compensation
which
congress
had
intended,
would
be
subject
to
the
social
security
and
unemployment
compensation
tax.
if
the
court
please,
we're
--
we're
not
here
to
--
to
debate
the
merits
of
whether
or
not
these
crews
and
captains
were
or
were
not
employees.
we
are
here
to
contend
and
we
hope
satisfy
the
court
that
this
legal
issue
of
whether
or
not
these
particular
individuals
were
employees
or
were
joint
venturers
or
were
lessees,
whatever,
was
an
issue
that
shouldn't
--
wherever
it
should've
been
tried
out,
should
not
have
been
tried
out
in
an
injunction
proceeding.
the
--
there
is
a
procedure
for
the
payment
of
a
tax
and
a
suit
for
refund.
this
is
the
procedure
contemplated
by
congress.
there
is
if
--
if
that
procedure
is
not
available,
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
congress
intended
that
the
--
the
matter
be
disposed
of
administratively.
the
administrative
process
is
there,
it's
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
that
it
is
unfair,
that
procedural
shortcuts
have
been
taken,
that
there
has
been
discrimination.
it's
the
government's
position
that
congress
intended
that
the
--
that
matters
like
this
be
disposed
off
either
administratively
or
in
a
suit
for
refund.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no
mr.
justice
harlan
and
i
know
how
interested
the
court
is
in
--
in
the
administrative
practice
with
respect
to
an
issue
and
i've
defined
in
our
brief,
did
not
include
a
published
ruling.
in
fact,
in
1940,
it
is
not
cited
in
the
brief
and
if
the
court
please,
i'll
--
i'll
give
the
citation
now.
it
is
sst,
which
must
mean
social
security
tax,
387
appearing
in
cumulative
bulletin,
1940-1
at
page
192.
now
this
--
this
ruling,
and
if
i
may
describe
it
briefly,
considered
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
--
it's
volume
1
of
the
19
--
section
1
of
the
1940
volume
of
cumulative
bulletin
published
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
and
the
page
is
192.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it's
involved
--
it
is
involved
ultimately
in
this
sense
only,
mr.
justice
brenan.
we
think
that
it's
possible
and
--
to
dispose
of
this
case
and
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
below
on
the
ground
that
irrespective
of
whether
ultimately
it
is
resolved
as
a
matter
fact
in
law
that
these
individuals
are
employees.
the
court
below
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
that
issue
in
this
proceeding,
that
is
a
proceeding
initiated
by
a
complaint
in
equity
praying
for
an
injunction
against
the
director
of
internal
revenue.
as
regards
the
--
the
ruling,
mr.
justice
harlan,
this
was
a
ruling
with
respect
to
the
liability
of
the
owners
of
fishing
schooners
operating
not
for
shrimp
but
for
fish.
the
essence
of
the
issue
was
whether
the
share
basis
of
compensation
which
is
--
is
not
unique
in
the
fishing
industry.
it
may
not
be
universal
but
it
is
certainly
not
unique
where
the
employees
and
the
owners
were
compensated
by
dividing
up
the
proceeds
of
the
catch
in
a
manner
of
share
profits
whether
people
in
that
capacity
were
employees
for
purposes
of
this
tax.
and
in
1940,
the
internal
revenue
service
rule
that
there
was
that
--
that
where
--
even
though
the
compensation
was
--
by
--
on
a
share
basis,
the
crews
and
captains
were
nevertheless
employees
of
the
shipowners.
i
--
i
hasten
to
point
out
that
the
service
in
this
ruling
satisfied
itself
that
there
was
the
control
necessary
to
the
employer-employee
relationship
by
looking
to
a
contract
which
ran
from
the
crews
and
captains
to
a
labor
union
and
from
the
owners
to
a
labor
union.
that
particular
fact
or
that
particular
evidence
of
control
is
not
necessarily
that
i
don't
think
is
in
this
case,
we
have
what
we
--
we
thought
we
had
other
evidence
of
the
control
necessary
to
create
an
employer-employee
relationship.
but
if
--
if
--
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
sir,
the
answer
is
that
at
least
since
1940,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
asserted
and
collected
tax
from
both
owners
who
operate
them
substantially
in
the
same
way
that
these
boats
are
operated
that
is
on
a
share
basis.
in
addition
to
that,
we
now
have
a
number
of
cases
pending
on
suits
for
refund
all
through
the
gulf
coast
where
taxpayers
have
paid
this
tax,
having
been
assessed
and
have
sued
for
it's
refund
and
i
might
point
out
that
those
are
very
--
those
--
those
refund
suits
are
being
very
hotly
contested.
many
of
them
are
being
tried
before
juries
and
as
the
court
may
notice
from
our
brief,
we
won
one
of
those
cases
in
january
or
a
series
of
those
cases
in
the
district
court
in
texas.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
back
to
the
right
to
sue
for
refund?
the
question
that
--
that
--
in
this
case
mr.
justice
clark,
we
think
that
the
--
that
neither
the
taxpayer
nor
the
government
was
as
imaginative
as
it
might
have
been
in
--
in
figuring
out
a
remedy.
of
course,
if
a
--
an
assessment
for
a
taxable
period
is
beyond
the
means
of
the
taxpayer,
his
only
remedy
is
to
submit
to
distraint
and
then
sue
to
--
for
a
refund
of
the
proceeds
of
the
res
--
of
the
distraint.
however,
in
this
particular
case
and
with
respect
to
unemployment
compensation
and
social
security
particularly,
we
suggest
in
our
brief
and
--
and
we
venture
to
suggest
as
a
possibility
although
it's
not
precisely
before
us
that
in
a
situation
where
a
taxpayer
would
be
driven
to
the
wall
by
an
assessment
and
collection
of
everything
he
owns
that
he
could
conceivably
pay
less
than
all
of
the
assessments
for
all
of
the
taxable
periods
to
the
extent
of
his
reasonability
to
pay.
and
without
violating
the
rules
established
by
this
court
in
the
flora
case
with
respect
to
the
income
tax
then
sue
for
a
refund
without
the
court
being
asked
of
jurisdiction,
in
other
words,
we
think
that
a
district
court
could
entertain
a
refund
claim.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
for
a
quarter
or
for
a
year.
for
a
quarter
for
all
the
employer
owes
or
possibly
for
a
quarter
for
all
that
he
owes
with
respect
to
a
particular
employee.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
not
to
my
knowledge
justice
brennan.
there's
a
footnote
which
we
cite
in
the
flora
opinion
which
suggests
this
possibility
with
respect
to
the
excise
tax
suggesting
that
the
excise
tax
is
different
from
the
income
tax.
that
it
may
be
possible
to
pay
the
excise
tax
with
respect
to
one
transaction
where
there
are
many
transactions.
that
doesn't
mean
in
all
fairness
that
we
couldn't
go
ahead
and
distrain
nevertheless
if
this
wouldn't
stay
as
--
i
hope
we
would
be
reasonable
about
such
a
--
a
situation,
but
it
does
mean
that
a
district
court
would
have
just
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
there
has
been
such
a
finding.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
it's
--
it
is
conceivable
--
quite
conceivable
to
me
that
this
taxpayer
as
a
matter
of
fact
hadn't
thought
he
owed
the
tax
or
had
--
it
hadn't
occurred
to
him
that
he
owed
tax.
in
the
antitrust
case,
in
footnotes
in
that
opinion
in
236
f.2d,
there
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
a
number
of
people
similarly
situated
were
at
the
time
of
that
case
paying
social
security
tax
with
respect
to
their
crews
and
captains.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
antitrust
case,
the
--
the
defendant
was
a
--
a
--
really
an
--
an
association
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
of
fisherman
sort
of
the
labor
union.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
and
they
asserted
a
defense
that
the
antitrust
action
couldn't
lie
because
of
the
norris-laguardia
provisions
or
because
there
was
a
--
because
it
was
a
labor
dispute.
and
in
order
to
--
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
labor
dispute,
there
had
to
be
an
employer-employee
relationship
more
or
less
across
the
board,
all
of
the
members
of
the
union
had
to
be
employees.
and
if
the
--
if
the
court
will
notice
the
opinion
of
judge
reeves
in
the
antitrust
case
and
incidentally,
it
is
significant
that
judge
reeves
is
the
author
of
the
court's
opinion
in
the
antitrust
case
and
the
author
of
the
dissent
in
this
case,
this
issue
didn't
seem
to
bother
him.
but
in
the
--
in
the
antitrust
case,
there
were
several
categories
of
relationships.
there
were
in
addition
to
the
relationship
at
issue
here,
a
very
substantial
number
of
crews
who
were
--
of
captains
who
own,
literally
own
their
own
boat,
could
under
no
stretch
of
the
imagination,
be
considered
employees.
it
is
quite
consistent
with
the
ultimate
result
in
the
shrimp
case
--
in
the
antitrust
case
to
say
that
there
were
some
people
involved
there
who
were
not
employees
and
yet
the
particular
taxpayer
here
had
employees.
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
an
irreconcilable
conflict.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
one
--
one
area
of
which
--
the
one
authority
which
causes
this
issue
on
which
the
court
below
relied
and
which
makes
the
--
the
case
more
than
ordinary
concern
is
the
real
--
the
--
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
1930's
and
stand
--
in
miller
against
standard
nut
margarine,
284
u.s.
the
court
below
found
in
that
case
authority
for
its
decision
here.
and
the
nut
margarine
case
was
one
in
which
an
excise
tax
was
assessed
against
the
taxpayer,
an
excise
tax
aimed
at
oleomargarine
made
from
animal
or
from
some
other
sources,
was
assessed
against
this
taxpayer
because
on
the
account
of
his
product,
made
from
peanut
butter
and
peanut
products.
the
issue
had
been
litigated
by
other
taxpayers
over
and
over
again.
the
government
had
lost
at
least
three
cases
in
the
courts
and
won
none.
the
treasury
department
had
published
a
ruling,
a
published
ruling
that
a
product
like
the
taxpayer's
product
was
not
taxable.
the
department
had
gone
on
and
issued
a
specific
ruling
to
this
taxpayer
that
he
wouldn't
be
taxable
if
he'd
gone
ahead
and
produced,
and
he
had
produced
this
product
in
reliance
on
that
ruling.
after
he'd
run
out
his
inventory,
the
government
came
back
on
him
for
a
very
heavy
excise
tax.
he
claimed
that
this
issue
was
already
decided
against
the
government
that
it
was
in
effect
pure
discrimination
against
him
as
distinguished
from
his
competitors
to
make
the
claim
of
this
tax
against
him
particularly
when
it
acted
so
heavily
in
reliance
on
the
government's
concessions
that
he
wasn't
taxable.
they
--
he
also
alleged
and
the
court
there
accepted
his
allegation
that
if
this
tax
was
paid
by
him
in
this
circumstances,
he
would
be
put
out
of
business.
we
want
to
note
that
justices
stone
and
brandeis
dissented
from
that
decision.
a
similar
issue
about
--
that
is
an
issue
about
the
meaning
of
what
--
of
what
has
now
said
in
421,
was
before
this
court
in
allen
against
regents
of
georgia
and
in
that
case
concurring
opinions
by
justices
reed
and
black,
suggest
that
they
too
have
doubts
--
had
doubts
that
time
about
the
nut
margarine
opinion
but
even
assuming
that
nut
margarine
--
that
nut
margarine
case
stakes
out
an
exception
to
the
--
to
the
rule.
we
think
fairly
clear
rules
stated
by
congress
in
the
statute.
we
think
that
this
williams
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
among
other
reasons
because
there
is
just
--
there
was
no
complaint
in
the
pleadings
and
there
was
no
basis
proved
at
the
hearing
for
a
claim
that
the
government
or
the
tax
authorities
had
acted
discriminatorily
with
respect
to
this
taxpayer
or
had
taxed
him
when
they
weren't
taxing
other
people.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no
sir
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
--
the
wording
--
the
changes
in
the
wording
don't
--
don't
mean
anything
to
us.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no
sudden
changes.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
but
the
congress
is
certainly
--
if
you
wanted
to
say
it,
you
could
--
if
--
if
you
could
say
that
the
congress
has
embraced
the
--
the
nut
margarine
rule
by
reenacting
the
internal
revenue
code
over
these
years.
that's
--
that
is
a
possibility.
and
yet,
if
the
congress
wanted
to
overrule,
for
instance,
if
this
williams
case,
became
the
law
and
congress
wanted
to
say
that
--
that
it
didn't
want
courts
to
entertain
injunction
proceedings,
i
would
be
hard
foot
to
suggest
to
them
how
they
would
amend
the
statute
to
make
it
any
plainer
than
it
is.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
have
nothing
more
your
honor
unless
there
are
questions.
