this
is
a
jury
trial,

before
a
jury
of
six,
was
that
right?

unanimous

the

who
wrote
the

justice

because
there
--
you
said
there's
no
question
about
the
illiteracy,
it
seems
to
me
that
implicitly
there
are
maybe
some
question
(voice

justice

no
question
about
the
fact
he
alleges
it.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
in
the
transcript
of
the
trial,
the
fact
that
he's
illiterate,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
simply
an
allegation
in
his
petition.
justice
potter
stewart
is
your
point
that
the

is
it
--
or
is
it
your
contention
that
due
process
imposed
an
obligation
on
this
trial
court
to
--
affirmatively,
to
offer
counsel
to
these
defendants
(voice

justice

and
then
of

he
could
have
waived
it,

in

of

all

justice

i
think

isn't
that
perhaps
your

your
opponent's
point
that
a

that
a
judge
just
isn't
in
the
position
to
do
for
a
defendant
no

how
fair
he
is

how
lacking
in
animus
towards
the
defendant,
he
was
in
the
position

represent

he

justice

under
florida
decisions
and
under
florida
law,
the
defendant
has
unqualified
right
to
counsel
only
in
a
capital
case,
isn't
that
correct?
justice

stewart
but
in
any
event,
the
law
of
florida
is
that
--
justice

--
in
a
capital
case
you
have
--
justice
potter

absolute
right.
