if
the
petitioner
is
required
to
await
the
termination
of
his
case
under
--
there
can
be
a
hearing
in
the
florida
courts,
probably
return
here.
what
do
you
say
to
the
question
of
betts
versus
brady
under
those
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
that
the
only
alternative?
we've
had
quite
a
number
of
cases
where
we've
held
that
the
one
reason
or
another,
the
--
there
was
a
denial
of
some
constitutional
requirement
in
the
trial.
and
we
have
reversed
the
case,
held
it
pending,
give
the
state
a
certainly
length
of
time,
do
what
it
should
which
in
this
case
would
be
a
new
trial.
what
is
it
to
prevent
that?
justice
hugo

that
would
be
quite
different
so
far
as
this
is
concerned,
so
far
as
this
defendant
is
concerned
and
according
in
his
rights
if
betts
and
brady
is
wrong.
they're
quite
a
difference
because
that
would
be
a
reversal
in
the
state
of
florida
like
other
states
gives
bail.
state
of
florida
could
give
bail,
wouldn't
entangle
us
with
it,
was
it?
anymore
that
would
entangle
us
after
the
whole
betts
and
brady
fails.
