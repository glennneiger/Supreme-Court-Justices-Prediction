mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
before
going
in
to
my
argument
on
this
case,
i
would
like
to
move
the
court,
if
the
court
please,
that
counsel
for
the
respondent,
james
g.
mahorner,
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida,
be
permitted
to
argue
this
course,
pro
hac
vice.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
thank
you.
may
the
court
please.
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
which
was
instituted
by
the
petitioner
in
the
florida
supreme
court.
it
was
instituted
to
test
the
legality
of
the
petitioner's
detention
by
the
state
of
florida.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
on
two
counts
along
with
his
wife
who
is
also
charged
with
two
counts
of
incest
and
so-called
fondling
or
lewd
and
lascivious
behavior
and
trial
took
place
on
september
19th,
1958.
it
was
a
trial
before
a
jury.
petitioner
was
not
aided
by
counsel
in
the
course
of
his
trial.
his
wife
is
not
a
party
to
the
proceedings
in
this
court,
thus,
i
will
deal
only
with
the
allegation
that's
set
forth
concerning
the
petitioner.
summarizing
briefly,
the
allegations
of
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
in
the
florida
court
were
as
follows.
first,
the
petitioner
is
being
illegally
restrained
by
the
state
contrary
both
to
the
florida
declaration
of
rights
and
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
united
states
constitution.
second,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
on
november
5th,
1957.
he
was
held
until
september
8th,
1958
when
he
was
tried
before
a
jury
on
september
19th,
1958,
convicted
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
from
six
months
to
20
years.
petition
alleged
that
the
petitioner
was
completely
without
education
and
“cannot
recount
the
abcs”
that
he
“did
not
posses
the
most
elementary
rudiments
of
criminal
procedure”.
he
was
held
in
solitary
confinement
so
he
alleged
for
five
months.
he
was
not
advised
of
his
right
to
arraignment
without
unnecessary
delay
and
he
was
held
without
a
charge
against
him
from
november
5th,
1957
to
august
11th,
1958.
he
also
alleged
that
he
requested
lie
detector
test
that
he
did
request
defense
counsel
to
assist
him
in
his
trial
that
he
protested
his
innocence
and
his
inability
to
conduct
to
defense,
and
that
when
he
attempted
to
cross-examine
the
prosecuting
witness,
he
was
ordered
to
sit
down.
he
also
requested
that
he
--
he
also
alleged
that
he
requested
blood
test
and
that
no
medical
doctor
testified
at
the
trial
and
further
prosecution
waited
until
after
the
birth
of
the
prosecuting
witness'
child
to
fix
the
date
with
the
alleged
defense
occurred.
finally,
he
made
a
legal
argument
that
the
two
crimes
of
fondling
and
incest
cannot
coexist
under
the
florida
law
and
he
prayed
for
issuance
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
florida
supreme
court
issued
such
a
writ
referred
to
in
this
court's
recent
opinion
on
mcneal
versus
culver
i
believe
is
a
provisional
writ
on
june
16th,
1960
requiring
the
respondent
to
make
a
proper
return
to
the
petitioner's
petition.
summarizing
again,
the
allegations
of
the
return
to
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
they
were
as
follows.
first,
the
respondent
held
petitioner
pursuant
to
a
commitment
predicated
on
a
judgment
and
cent
--
centered
by
the
florida
trial
court
on
september
19th,
1958
after
a
jury
verdict
against
the
petitioner
on
both
counts.
second,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
on
november
5th,
1957
on
a
warrant
issued
by
the
county
judge,
which
was
predicated
on
an
affidavit
charging
the
crimes
of
rape
and
fondling
allegedly
occurring
on
october
31st,
1957.
on
august
8th,
1958,
respondent
alleged
the
grand
jury
returned
an
indictment
against
the
petitioner
charging
the
crimes
of
incest
and
fondling
allegedly
occurring
on
july
10th,
1957.
and
the
prosecuting
attorneys
subsequently
filed
an
information
based
on
the
indictment
which
is
the
document
upon
which
petitioner
was
tried
on
september
19th.
the
respondent
asserted
that
--
in
fact
the
petitioner
waived
the
jury
trial
but
nonetheless,
the
court
required
the
submission
of
the
issues
to
a
jury.
respondent
denied
that
petitioner
was
totally
unable
to
defend
himself.
he
denied
that
defense
counsel
was
requested.
he
denied
that
the
court
ordered
the
petitioner
to
sit
down.
and
he
denied
that
lie
detector
and
blood
test
were
requested
by
the
petitioner.
he
affirmatively
alleged
that
petitioner
actively
participated
in
the
trial,
and
was
carefully
instructed
by
the
trial
court
concerning
both
his
state
and
his
federal
constitutional
rights.
the
respondent
attached
a
transcript
of
the
trial
proceedings
to
the
return
along
with
certain
other
documents,
the
information,
the
judgment
in
sentence,
the
commitment,
the
affidavit
upon
which
the
original
warrant
was
predicated,
the
warrant
and
the
indictment
of
the
grand
jury.
the
respondent
concluded
by
denying
all
allegations
of
the
petition
that
were
not
expressly
admitted
or
dealt
with
in
the
return.
petitioner
then
filed
a
return
to
the
respondent's
return
in
which
he
asserted
that
the
transcript
attached
to
the
respondent's
return
affirmatively
showed
that
no
counsel
took
place
--
were
--
was
present
at
the
trial.
also,
that
the
record
was
silent
with
respect
to
petitioner's
alleged
request
for
the
assistance
of
counsel,
his
protestation
of
innocence
and
his
request
for
a
lie
detector
test.
the
petitioner
also
alleged
in
his
return
that
the
record
showed,
“two
proficient
prosecutors
were
arrayed
against
these
indigent
and
uneducated
defendants.”
he
concluded
by
stating
that
the
record
reflected
the
ignorance
in
the
total
inability
of
the
petitioner
to
conduct
any
defense
and
further
that
it
showed
no
affirmative
evidence
of
--
of
his
guilt.
the
florida
supreme
court
in
an
opinion,
which
it
rendered
on
september
23rd,
1960,
which
is
set
forth
at
the
back
of
the
printed
record
in
this
court,
discharged
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
it
granted
petitioner
no
hearing
to
establish
the
truth
of
his
charges,
rather,
it
examined
the
record
before
it,
the
petition
--
the
petitioner's
return
and
the
documents
attached
to
the
respondent's
return.
the
court
noted
in
its
opinion
that
the
law
of
florida
does
not
require
appointment
of
counsel
for
indigent
defendants
except
in
capital
cases
citing
section
909.21
of
the
florida
statutes.
it
also
stated
that
wherever,
our
record
shows
that
a
defendant
either
has
no
counsel
or
fails
to
show
whether
or
not
he
had
counsel,
it
will
be
presumed
that
the
defendant
waived
counsel.
it
recited
that
while
the
evidence
in
the
record
showed
conclusively,
and
this
was
the
florida
supreme
court
talking,
“conclusively,
the
petitioner
was
illiterate.
there
was
no
showing
that
the
petitioner
suffered
from
lack
of
intelligence”,
concluded
that
the
evidence
was
ample
to
sustain
the
charge
against
petitioner
and
discharge
the
writ.
petitioner,
thereafter,
filed
a
motion
on
december
22nd,
1960
for
leave
to
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
this
court,
and
this
court
treating
the
papers
filed
as
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
granted
the
petition
on
june
19th,
1960.
in
summary,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
following
facts
or
--
or
undisputed
both
from
the
petition
and
from
the
return
in
the
documents
attached
to
the
return
from
the
record.
first
of
all,
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
arrested
on
november
5th,
1957,
second
that
he
was
thereafter
held
until
his
trial
on
september
19th,
1958
that
the
information
which
was
filed
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
after
the
indictment
by
the
grand
jury
was
the
basis
for
the
prosecution.
he
was
not
tried
on
the
grand
jury's
charges.
and
i
think
it's
also
clear
that
counsel
was
not
present,
and
it's
not
disputed,
the
counsel
was
not
present
at
any
stage
of
the
trial
proceedings.
the
record
is
silent
completely
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
petitioner
requested
the
assistance
of
counsel.
it's
likewise
silent
as
to
any
advice
by
the
court
to
petitioner
of
--
of
a
right
to
counsel
either
counsel
of
his
own
choosing
or
counsel
appointed
by
the
state.
the
verbatim
trans
--
transcript
of
the
proceedings,
as
the
court
will
note
from
the
record,
takes
--
starts
at
a
point
when
the
jury
has
already
been
selected
in
the
court,
it
is
instructing
the
petitioner
that
he
has
the
right
to
make
an
opening
statement
to
that
jury
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
the
proceedings
prior
to
that
time
either
at
the
trial.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
with
respect
to
an
arraignment
or
anything
of
that
sort
when
petitioner
might
have
been
advised
of
a
right
to
counsel.
so
i
think
we
--
we'll
have
to
conclude
that
the
record
is
silent
on
that
point.
the
respondent
in
--
in
his
return
to
petitioner's
writ
does
not
allege
any
waiver
by
petitioner
of
the
right
to
counsel.
that
point
was
never
presented
as
a
factual
matter
to
the
support
of
the
supreme
court
though
the
florida
supreme
court
did
refer
to
the
presumption
of
waiver
in
its
opinion.
and
the
respondent
here
in
its
brief
does
suggest
that
in
fact,
this
presumption
of
waiver
should
control.
finally,
i
think
there
isn't
any
question
that
petitioner
is
in
fact
and
has
established
his
illiteracy.
the
florida
supreme
court
said
on
its
examination
of
the
record
that
there
is
no
question
that
petitioner
is
illiterate.
without
going
into
detail
review
of
the
numerous
opinions
of
this
court,
culminating,
i
--
i
noticed
yesterday
in
your
chewning
opinion
concerning
the
denial
of
--
of
due
process,
denial
of
fourteenth
amendment
guarantees
by
state
criminal
proceedings
under
circumstances
such
that
the
trial
cannot
be
said
to
meet
the
test
of
fundamental
fairness
required
by
betts
versus
brady.
i
would
like
to
--
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
--
the
more
or
less
clear,
i
think,
proposition
that
among
the
circumstances
that
must
be
considered
following
the
betts
versus
brady
rule
in
determining
whether
or
not
fundamental
fairness
existed
at
any
trial
in
state
court
proceedings,
among
those
circumstances
are
necessarily
the
education,
the
mental
capacity,
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
defend
himself
without
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
his
trial.
i
think
also,
it's
--
it's
completely
clear,
at
this
point
as
emphasized
in
the
chewning
opinion
yesterday,
that
the
complexity
of
the
issues
that
either
are
involved
or
that
could
have
been
involved
in
the
trial
are
also
of
importance
in
all
of
the
cases
that
i'll
just
mention
briefly,
mcneal
versus
culver,
and
incidentally
quite
a
few
of
these
come
from
florida
courts,
hudson
versus
north
carolina,
cash
versus
culver,
moore
versus
michigan,
herman
versus
claudy,
gibbs
versus
burke,
wade
versus
mayo,
uveges
versus
pennsylvania,
massey
versus
moore.
there
--
there
are
others
cited
in
the
brief.
and
all
of
these
cases,
this
court
has
emphasized
the
importance
of
the
--
the
ability
of
the
petitioner
to
defend
himself
in
the
phase
of
complex
legal
charges
for
his
educational
ability,
his
--
his
educational
background,
his
ability
to
defend
himself,
his
ability,
as
in
this
case,
to
read
or
write
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
are
involved.
petitioner's
basic
argument
is
that
his
--
the
circumstances
of
his
conviction
clearly
were
sufficient
to
bring
back
conviction
within
the
rule
of
these
cases,
that
he
was
in
his
trial
denied
the
fairness
required
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
our
florida
procedure
and
other
than
capital
cases
provides
for
a
jury
of
six,
both
civil
and
criminal
cases
other
than
capital.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
yes,
in
a
criminal
case
and
in
most
civil
cases.
it
was
a
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
excuse
me.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
think
the
petitioner
has
clearly
established
circumstances
in
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
would
bring
his
case
within
the
rule
of
betts
versus
brady.
i
do
argue,
however,
that
if
this
court
should
conclude
and
--
and
i
don't
believe
that
it
can
on
the
basis
of
his
allegation,
but
if
the
court
should
conclude
that
the
circumstances
here
were
not
sufficient
to
bring
the
case
within
the
betts
versus
brady
rule,
then
the
court
should
reexamine
that
rule
because
of
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
since
that
time,
and
along
the
line
suggested
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
mcneal
versus
culver
in
last
term.
and
with
the
court's
permission
after
i
examined
these
circumstances,
i
will
go
into
that.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
reach
that
if
the
case
is
dealt
with
on
the
betts'
theory
and
i
think
it
can
be
but
at
the
same
time,
if
there
should
be
a
feeling
that
in
fact
these
circumstances
are
not
sufficient
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
then
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
excuse
me.
then
we
would
have
to
get
to
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
i
believe
that
the
record
contains
sufficient
undisputed
facts
to
justify
the
petitioner
to
that
relief,
and
i'll
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
there
was
no
hearing.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
from
the
record
that
is
attached
to
the
respondent's
return
and
to
the
allegations
of
the
petition
that
are
admitted
by
the
respondent.
if
i
could
summarize
those
undisputed
facts,
which
i
believe
the
state
recognizes
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
well,
yes,
i
think
the
--
then
perhaps
the
admission
is
on
that
basis.
on
the
other
hand,
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
florida
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
tends
to
treat
them
as
facts
found.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
for
example,
the
illiteracy,
the
florida
supreme
court
says
the
record
shows
conclusively
that
the
petitioner
is
illiterate.
but
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
the
state
court
rule
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
yes.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
well,
no,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
it
now
if
i
could
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
since
the
question
has
come
up.
i
think
since
the
state
court
opinion
is
in
question,
that
it
really
goes
a
little
further
than
--
than
your
suggestion,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
it
--
it
does
not
even
mention
the
possibility
or
the
probability
for
the
necessity
of
a
hearing
anyway.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
simply
examines
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
circumstances
which
it
states
are
fairly
well
undisputed
or
which
i
gathered
states
our
fairly
well
undisputed,
can
constitute
a
basis
for
the
relief
which
this
petitioner
request.
and
without
mentioning,
in
spite
of
petitioner's
statement
that
this
is
in
the
violation
of
his
federal
constitutional
rights,
without
even
mentioning
that,
the
florida
supreme
court
simply
says
and
i
quote,
“the
law
of
this
state
does
not
require
the
court
to
appoint
counsel
to
represent
indigent
defendants
except
in
cases
where
they
are
charged
with
a
capital
offense,
section
909.21
florida
statutes,
period.”
it
doesn't
go
on
to
the
necessity
for
a
hearing
and
dismisses
the
entire
case
on
that
ground.
and
i
believe,
in
view
of
this
language
and
if
i
could
quote
again
from
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion,
“an
examination
of
the
evidence
and
the
record
in
this
proceeding
shows
that
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
and
the
petitioners
thoroughly,
with
reference
to
their
constitutional
rights.
the
evidence
was
ample
to
establish
the
charges
against
them,
and
there
is
not
the
least
showing
that
they
were
prejudiced
in
any
respect
of
the
trial.
to
grant
a
new
trial
would
amount
to
nothing
more
than
trashing
overall
(inaudible)”
to
reduce
discharge.
i
believe
the
florida
supreme
court
went
a
little
further
than
simply
addressing
itself
to
the
necessity
of
a
hearing
or
treating
this
as
an
effect
or
demur
to
the
petition.
it
looked
at
the
record.
this
is
affirmatively
indicated
by
its
opinion.
it
said,
“on
the
basis
of
this
record
and
the
facts
that
we
find
in
this
record,
this
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
release.”
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
i
--
i
think
there
is
a
possible
problem
there.
i
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
it
might
have
said
that.
i
don't
believe
that
it
did
in
this
case.
and
i
believe
that
the
--
the
undisputed
facts,
if
i
could
run
through
those
briefly,
are
sufficient
that
while
we
could
have
a
hearing
below,
there
would
be
nothing
to
be
accomplished
by
it.
first
of
all,
there's
no
dispute
as
to
the
illiteracy.
secondly,
there's
no
dispute
that
there
was
no
counsel
present
at
the
trial.
third,
there's
no
dispute
as
to
what
the
charges
against
the
petitioner
were.
they
were
charges
of
incest
and
lewd
behavior
with
a
child.
they
were
certainly
inflammatory
charges.
there
isn't
a
question
about
it.
they're
disgusting
type
of
charges
and
would
certainly
be
expected
to
disgust
any
--
any
six
people
chosen
for
a
jury.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
who
wrote
it
but
i
suspect
that
a
friend
of
the
petitioners
in
the
courtroom
or
in
the
jail
wrote
it.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
i'm
relying
for
that
on
the
opinion
of
the
florida
supreme
court
which
said
there
was
no
question
of
his
illiteracy.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
no,
the
--
the
florida
supreme
court
says
that
there's
no
question
of
his
illiteracy
periods.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
no,
sir,
there's
no
mention
of
it
in
the
trial.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
it's
an
allegation
in
his
petition
and
it's
a
conclusion
of
the
florida
supreme
court
set
forth
in
their
opinion.
frankly,
i
have
never
met
the
petitioner.
i
haven't
talked
with
him.
the
only
correspondents
i've
had
as
far
as
i
know
has
been
handled
through
some
friend
of
his
in
the
penitentiary.
there
is
a
reference
in
his
return
which
is
set
forth
on
page
70
of
the
--
of
the
record
to
the
fact
that
the
only
way
he
has
been
able
to
get
a
hearing
is
through
the
assistance
of
a
friend
in
jail.
i
was
trying
to
find
the
exact
language.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
well,
your
honor,
if
--
if
that
is
what
this
petitioner
has
faced
with,
why
i
believe
that
it
would
certainly
be
desirable
and
perhaps
shouldn't
presume
to
suggest
it
but
incumbent
upon
this
court
to
reexamine
betts
versus
brady
because
i
think
this
record
clearly
does
raise
the
issue
that
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
whittaker
in
the
mcneal
versus
culver
case
specifically
express
no
opinion
on
that
is
whether
or
not
in
fact
betts
versus
brady
has
been
implicitly
modified
or
overruled.
and
i
would
strongly
urge
the
court
if
that
was
the
conclusion
that
in
fact
there
are
not
undisputed
facts
here
sufficient
to
--
to
entitle
petitioner
to
immediate
discharge
to
consider
the
further
argument
of
whether
or
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
not
betts
versus
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
but
your
honor,
as
i
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
excuse
me.
as
i
read
a
number
of
other
decisions
of
this
court,
there
have
been
situations
in
which
an
immediate
discharge
of
this
order.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
i
believe
in
the
chewning
case
yesterday
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
well
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--it
may
--
i
suppose
there
might
be
some
questions
of
double
jeopardy
or
a
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
i
am
not
attempting
to
--
to
say
that
that's
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
i
don't
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
i
don't
quite
follow
the
argument,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
we
would
necessarily
--
if
this
court
where
to
discharge
petitioner
deprived
florida
of
another
opportunity
to
trial
regardless
of
whether
this
court
should
reverse
and
remand
the
case
for
a
hearing
to
establish
factual
allegations.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
well
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
well,
there's
no
--
no
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
there's
no
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
question
of
bail
and
there's
not
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
likely
to
be
one.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
yes,
he's
out
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
period
if
you
discharge
him
unless
the
state
decides
that
they
want
to
try
him
again
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
just
as
he
will
be
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
florida
make
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
the
only
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
the
only
item
that
you
would
be
taking
out
of
the
control
of
florida,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
as
far
as
i
can
see
and
i
may
be
missing
something
here.
so
as
far
as
i
can
see,
the
only
thing
you're
taking
out
of
florida
by
reversing
this
case
summarily
and
discharging
the
petitioner
rather
than
reversing
it
for
a
hearing
would
be
the
--
first
of
all,
the
time
delay
that
the
state
would
have
and
the
requirement
of
the
petitioner
remain
actually
in
the
custody
of
the
state
until
that
hearing
was
over.
and
second,
we
--
the
requirement
that
of
course
petitioner
continue
to
find
counsel
or
find
sufficient
assistance
to
--
to
present
his
case
de
novo
in
a
hearing
in
florida.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
frankfurter
i
can't
imagine
the
--
the
state
sitting
by
if
they
can
--
if
they're
convinced
that
they
want
to
try
this
man
again
and
letting
him
walk
out
of
the
jailhouse
without
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
re-arresting
him
the
minute
he
walks
through
the
door,
if
they
want
to
that.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
no,
sir.
they
may
arrest
him
on
a
new
charge
and
try
him
for
any
number
of
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
other
terms.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
well,
be
it
for
me
to
suggest
en
--
entanglements
but
i
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
they
could.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
oh,
i
--
i'm
not
concerned
about
the
editorial
opinion.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
i
think
that
certainly
is
another
alternative
that's
open.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
i
think
there
are
number
of
cases
though,
may
it
please
the
court.
and
i
--
i
did
look
into
what
i
could
determine
from
this
court's
opinion
as
to
the
discharge
in
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
in
this
matter.
there
are
number
of
cases
in
this
court
where
the
opinion
has
concluded
with
the
simple
phrase
reversed.
now,
i
don't
know
as
a
practical
matter
what
happens
when
this
occurs.
i
think
in
the
chewning
case
yesterday,
this
is
exactly
what
this
court
did
and
said
in
view
of
those
complicated
problems
that
were
involved
in
a
multiple
offender
type
statute
situation,
counsel
was
--
was
necessary
in
order
to
--
to
keep
this
petitioner
from
being
deprived
of
due
process
of
law
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
for
that
reason
the
case
is
reversed.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
well,
i
--
i
will
press
the
matter
further,
your
honor.
i
think
i've
probably
done
more
than
i
should
have
already.
but
i
think
that
if
i
could
just
summarize
the
undisputed
facts
to
see
what
would
possibly
be
left
open
for
a
hearing.
now,
perhaps
what
i'm
really
saying
now
is
not
that
we
should
--
that
the
court,
as
you
say,
open
the
jail
door
but
that
the
court
should
not
infer
that
it's
necessary
for
the
florida
supreme
court
or
for
a
judicial
body
appointed
by
it
to
conduct
a
full
hearing
on
this
matter
because
there's
no
dispute
according
to
the
florida
supreme
court
itself
as
to
the
illiteracy.
there's
no
dispute
as
to
the
lack
of
counsel,
there's
no
dispute
to
the
nature
of
the
issue.
the
only
thing
that
i
can
see
that
there
would
be
a
factual
argument
on
or
dispute
would
be
the
possible
issue
of
waiver.
and
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
respondent's
return
that
counsel
was
waived
at
the
trial.
the
first
time
that
issue
has
been
raised
is
--
is
here
and
the
florida
supreme
court
deals
with
it
only
as
a
presumption
of
waiver
and
nothing
more.
as
far
as
i
can
see,
the
only
issue
that
could
be
going
into
in
a
hearing
on
this
petition
would
be
that
issue
of
waiver.
i
see
no
reason
for
this
court
to
suggest
by
as
it
has
in
some
instances
in
its
opinions
saying
that
the
cause
is
remanded
at
least
to
give
the
petitioner
a
hearing
or
an
opportunity
to
prove
the
--
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
factual
allegations
that
are
involved.
i
see
no
reason
for
that
type
of
language
in
an
opinion
directing
the
--
the
further
proceedings
below.
i
think
that
i
haven't
dealt
it
all
yet.
well,
i
have
repeated
the
illiteracy
and
--
and
so
forth.
anything
about
the
complex
issues
that
where
either
potentially
or
implicitly
or
--
or
otherwise
involved
in
the
petitioner's
trial.
again,
continuing
in
an
examination
of
the
facts
of
this
case
under
the
betts
versus
brady
rule
and
the
rule
of
the
cases
establishing,
further
amplifying
that
rule.
this
petitioner,
apparently,
was
convicted
under
what
the
florida
supreme
court
in
the
--
and
it
was
locally
called
the
florida
child
molester
law,
chapter
801
of
the
florida
statutes.
this
particular
law
has
a
number
of
other
provisions
in
it
whereas
the
petitioner
or
counsel
for
the
petitioner
might
have
raised
if
he'd
have
counsel
at
his
trial.
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
incumbent
that
we
show
here
and
the
respondent's
assertion
in
its
brief
but
we
couldn't
show
here
that
in
fact,
the
trial
judge
would
have
granted
any
of
the
rights
or
procedures
involved
under
that
statute.
but
nonetheless,
had
counsel
been
there,
he
could
have
made
a
number
of
approaches
to
the
court
by
a
way
of
motion
for
psychiatric
or
psychological
examination
for
a
commitment
for
treatment
even
for
suspension
of
judgment.
and
the
language
of
the
statute
clearly
spells
out
the
broad
authority
of
the
trial
judge
in
the
case
that
falls
under
the
child
molester
law
to
suspend
the
execution
of
judgment,
if
in
his
opinion
the
petitioner
can
best
be
rehabilitated
by
that
method.
there's
--
there
are
number
of
other
complications
involved
to
the
--
their
separate
statutes
in
florida
that
make
incest
a
crime,
that
make
fondling
a
crime.
these
statutes
are
all
purportedly
incorporated
by
section
801.02
of
the
child
molester
law.
at
least
one
case,
this
incorporation
of
the
statute
by
another
has
been
held
by
the
florida
supreme
court
to
be
unconstitutional.
i
don't
know
that
that
would
have
rendered
any
distinct
advantage
to
petitioner.
i
can't
tell
now
what
might
have
happened,
had
some
of
these
points
been
raised.
but
there
were
clearly
points
that
could
have
been
raised,
procedures
that
could
have
been
requested
for
this
petitioner
under
chapter
801,
head
counsel
then
present
to
request
them.
i
think
it's
clear,
too,
that
if
you
examine
the
record,
there
were
only
two
witnesses
against
the
petitioner
and
they
were
two
of
his
children.
he
was
forced
with
the
necessity
of
cross-examining
his
own
children
as
the
only
witnesses
against
him.
he
was
illiterate,
of
course,
which
was
a
handicap,
but
was
further
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
he
--
were
members
of
his
own
family
as
sole
witnesses
against
him.
an
independent
lawyer
could
certainly
have
done
a
better
job
on
that
or
done
a
job
at
all
if
--
if
we
forget
about
the
fact
for
the
moment
that
petitioner
was
illiterate.
there
isn't
any
question
if
you
--
if
you
look
at
the
transcript
that
the
cross-examination
of
these
witnesses
was
totally
inadequate
when
the
petitioner
was
unable
at
all
to
meet
the
issues
that
were
involved.
for
example,
i
--
i
think
i've
set
up
the
total
cross-examination
i
have
in
my
brief
of
both
witnesses
on
page
14,
the
entire
cross-examination
of
the
prosecuting
witness
has
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
the
question
by
mr.
carnley
was,
“carol
jean,
you
say
your
mother,
she
went
and
made
arrangements
to
get
the
casket
for
your
sister?”
"yes.”
"you
are
right
sure
now
that
she
did?”
“i
am
sure.”
“well,
i
will
tell
the
court,
my
wife
was
out
at
mr.
joe
gayfer's
house.”
and
then
the
court
interrupted
and
said,
“"wait
a
minute,
sir,
you
are
testifying.
you
will
have
a
chance
to
testify
when
the
state
rests.
any
questions
you
wish
to
ask
your
daughter,
you
are
welcome
to
do
it.”
well,
after
that
the
petitioner
didn't
ask
anymore
questions.
that's
the
total
cross-examination
of
the
prosecuting
witness
that
i
have
just
read.
the
total
cross-examination
by
the
prosecuting
witness'
wife
has
set
forth
on
the
top
of
page
15.
it's
--
it's
obvious
that
the
issues
involved
in
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses
were
totally
overlooked
by
the
petitioner
if
they
were
grasped
at
all
and
there
was
no
evidence
presented
to
the
jury
on
it.
incidentally,
there
is
a
point,
i
think,
worth
mentioning
that
in
somewhat
rambling
testimony
of
the
petitioner's
wife
in
the
short
portion
of
the
trial
in
which
either
petitioner
or
his
wife
was
testifying.
there
were
some
indication
that
a
lawyer
might
very
well
have
raised
the
severe
question
of
prejudice
on
the
part
of
the
prosecuting
witnesses.
on
page
53,
for
example,
in
mrs.
carnley's
testimony,
she
says,
"we
tried
to
be
firmed
with
them,
but
it
seemed
like
the
more
firm
we
got
these
two
older
kids,
they
couldn't
stand
the
pressure,
so
they
would,
every
time
that
their
daddy
would
get
after
them
or
something
or
other
about
some
of
their
doings,
well,
that
oldest
boy
would
say,
"well,
daddy,
you
will
sure
regret
it.
i
will
get
even
with
you
one
way
or
the
other.”
had
there
been
counsel
present
why
this
line
of
questioning,
cross-examination
clearly
could
have
been
followed?
further
and
counsel
been
present
why
the
petitioner
might
have
realized
when
he
took
the
witness
stand
on
his
own
behalf,
that
doing
so
would
sub
--
subject
him
to
cross-examination
by
the
prosecution.
the
state
urges
that
the
parties
were
completely
and
fully
apprised
of
all
of
their
constitutional
rights.
we've
already
noted
that
there's
no
evidence
from
the
record
that
they
were
apprised
of
any
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
it's
also
clear
in
the
trial
itself
that
they
weren't
apprised
of
the
fact
that
if
they
took
the
stand
themselves,
they
would
be
subject
to
cross-examination.
they
were
told
that
anything
they
said
could
be
held
as
self-incriminatory
but
they
weren't
told
about
the
cross-examination
nor
were
they
told
of
their
right
to
make
instructions
or
to
request
instructions
of
the
judge
to
be
given
to
the
jury.
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
there
is
absolutely
no
point
in
the
transcript
to
the
proceedings
where
either
of
the
--
either
the
petitioner
or
his
wife
made
any
objection
to
testimony
on
the
part
of
either
the
states'
witnesses.
in
all
of
these
ways,
i
think
it's
beyond
question
that
counsel
clearly
could
have
been
of
a
great
deal
of
assistance
and
in
fact
that
without
counsel,
the
petitioners
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
adequately
meet
the
charges
against
them.
in
view
of
the
position
of
the
state
on
--
on
possible
waiver
of
this
right
to
counsel
is
set
forth
in
this
--
the
brief
of
the
respondent
here.
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
this
waiver
issue.
the
--
as
i've
said,
the
return
of
the
respondent
in
the
court
below
does
not
allege
that
the
petitioner
waived
any
right
to
counsel.
there's
no
statement
in
there.
the
only
statement
that
could
be
related
to
it
is
the
statement
that
petitioner
did
not
request
counsel.
for
the
first
time
here,
there's
a
suggestion
i
suppose
on
the
basis
of
the
language
of
the
florida
supreme
court
that
in
fact
there
was
a
presumption
applied
by
that
court
of
waiver
which
is
binding
here
in
which
petitioner
was
under
a
duty
to
overcome.
well,
i
think
it's
--
it's
obvious
at
the
outset
and
since
petitioner
didn't
have
a
hearing
below
when
of
course
he
wasn't
given
any
opportunity
to
overcome
the
presumption
that
is
applied.
but
i
think
even
beyond
that
and
this
goes
again
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
would
be
anything
served
as
a
practical
matter
by
having
a
hearing
on
this
habeas
corpus
petition
below,
is
--
is
the
fact
that
the
presumption
of
waiver
which
is
the
only
thing
in
this
record
that
--
that
presents
any
issue
on
waiver
cannot
constitutionally
be
applied
by
a
state
to
deny
a
defendant
in
his
right
to
fair
hearing
in
the
court
below.
and
this
court
noted
in
johnson
versus
zerbst
that,
of
course,
that
was
a
federal
proceeding
but
it
noted
that
waiver
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights
is
not
something
that's
to
be
presumed
and
--
and
again,
in
a
subsequent
case
of
moore
versus
michigan
why
it
was
pointed
out
that
waiver
is
not
to
be
lightly
presumed.
if
a
state
could
apply
a
conclusive
presumption
in
the
absence
of
a
hearing
that
a
defendant
waived
his
right
to
counsel
with
no
support
in
the
record
factually
for
such
a
presumption,
why
it's
clear
that
this
court
would,
of
course,
cease
to
hear
any
cases
of
this
sort
or
could
cease
to
hear
it
because
the
presumption
of
waiver
could
conclusively
be
applied
by
the
state
below.
there
would
be
no
opportunity
for
a
petitioner
to
rebut
that
conclusive
presumption.
one
additional
word
concerning
the
ability
of
the
petitioner
to
defend
himself
at
the
trial,
the
florida
supreme
court
says
in
its
opinion
that
even
illiterate
defendants
may
be
intelligent
about
the
common
place
things
of
life.
as
i've
stated
in
my
brief,
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
we
can
conclude
that
a
serious
criminal
trial
carrying
a
sentence
up
to
20
years
is
one
of
the
common
place
things
of
life.
i
cannot
believe
that
the
types
of
issues
that
were
involved
here
or
such
that
an
illiterate
defendant
regardless
of
his
other
abilities
would've
adequately
been
able
to
meet
those
issues
and
conduct
a
defense
that
could
result
in
a
successful
--
that
would
be
a
successful
defense
or
result
in
an
acquittal.
an
illiterate
defendant
cannot
examine
the
indictment.
he
can't
look
at
the
information
for
among
other
things.
there's
no
basis
for
the
conclusion.
i
respectfully
submit
that
in
spite
of
illiteracy,
a
defendant
is
able
to
conduct
a
defense
in
a
serious
criminal
trial.
now,
turning,
if
i
could,
to
the
question
of,
“what
if
this
case
doesn't
come
under
betts
versus
brady
or
what
if
the
court
should
feel
it
permissible
in
this
case
to
reexamine
betts
versus
brady?”
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
has
already
done
that
in
effect
in
the
decision
in
griffin
versus
illinois
and
chandler
versus
fretag.
when
you
put
those
two
cases
together,
i
cannot
conclude
how
the
court
can
--
can
say
that
there
is
any
life
left
in
betts
versus
brady.
now,
as
i've
said,
it's
not
necessary
to
reach
--
reach
this
issue
but
if
we
do
reach
it,
why
it's
clear
that
under
chandler
versus
fretag,
reynolds
versus
cochran,
in
subsequent
cases
in
this
court,
a
defendant
who
can
afford
his
own
lawyer
has
an
unquestioned
and
unqualified
right
to
be
heard
by
that
lawyer
in
state
criminal
proceedings.
there's
no
--
no
qualification
on
that.
it's
also
clear,
i
believe
now,
in
view
of
griffin
versus
illinois
that
a
defendant
cannot
be
denied
effective
appellate
review
of
his
conviction
by
virtue
of
his
inability
to
obtain
funds
to
buy
a
transcript
which
a
state
may
require
as
a
prerequisite
to
review
of
that
conviction.
if
it
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
or
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
deny
appellate
review
equally
to
those
who
can
or
cannot
afford
transcripts
required
for
that
review,
how
can
it
be
otherwise
in
that
denial
of
due
process
to
deny
effective
representation
by
counsel
at
the
trial
itself
as
between
those
who
can
afford
counsel
and
those
who
cannot?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
the
importance
of
the
trial
as
opposed
to
appellate
review
--
review
really
makes
us
a
stronger
case
than
--
than
the
griffin
case.
it's
long
been
recognized
that
a
state
doesn't
have
to
provide
appellate
review
at
all.
but
it
is
now
clear
that
if
it
does,
why
it
must
provide
it
on
a
basis
that
is
available
alike
to
reach
in
poor.
it
cannot
effectively
cut
off
the
right
of
appellate
review
to
the
poor.
how
then
can
a
state
effectively
cut
off
the
right
to
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
trial
to
a
man
simply
because
he
can't
afford
that?
i
would
believe
that
putting
these
two
cases
together,
chandler
versus
fretag,
griffin
versus
illinois,
that
betts
versus
brady
has
implicitly
at
least
been
overruled
by
this
court.
now,
clearly
has
not
been
as
such
and
i
don't
urge
that
it
is
essential
at
this
court
reach
this
issue,
but
i
certainly
believe
it
is
presented
by
this
record
and
the
court
could
reach
it.
now,
why
is
it
presented
by
the
record?
first
of
all,
because
the
defendant
alleged
that
he
requested
counsel
from
the
state.
secondly,
he
alleged,
though
not
very
artfully
and
i
recognized
this,
that
he
was
an
indigent.
the
record
doesn't
reveal
a
specific
statement
by
the
defendant,
“i
am
an
indigent”
in
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
but
it's
clear
through
the
inartful
draftsmanship
of
it
that
he's
saying
that
on
page
3,
for
example,
in
the
original
petition,
he
says,
“courts
of
competent
jurisdiction
withheld
without
exception
to
the
court
is
devoid
of
jurisdiction
when
the
demand
for
counsel
has
denied
the
poor,”
arguing
his
lack
of
funds.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
no,
sir,
that
is
contested.
the
state
has
denied
that
he
requested
counsel.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
of
course,
this
court
--
excuse
me.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
absolutely
not,
this
court
has
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
no
question
about,
though
this
court
has
also
specifically
ruled
in
a
number
of
cases
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
a
--
an
accused
request
counsel
in
order
to
establish
his
right
to
that
counsel
if
the
circumstances
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
otherwise
justify.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
that
is
an
open
issue
but
my
position
on
that
is
that
even
though
it
is
open
if
resolved
in
favor
of
the
state,
it
wouldn't
affect
the
--
the
circumstances
here,
even
though
we
assumed
that
this
defendant
didn't
request
counsel.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
well,
that
--
that
is
a
possible
argument
but
even
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
yes.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
but
you
--
even
if
we
should
assume
for
reasons
other
than
he
was
incapable
of
requesting
it
that
he
didn't
request
it,
this
court
is
clearly
held
in
several
of
its
decisions.
uveges
versus
pennsylvania
is
one
where
the
issue
was
particularly
raised
that
in
fact
it's
not
necessary
to
request
counsel.
if
you
needed
it,
you're
entitled
to
it
regardless
of
whether
you
request
it.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
certainly,
he
could've
waived.
and
that
waiver
issue,
it
seems
to
me,
is
really
the
only
one
that
could
possibly
be
opened.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
right.
if
it
had
been
offered
and
the
defendant
had
said,
“i
know
all
about
my
rights.
i'm
perfectly
capable
of
conducting
my
own
defense.”
it's
possible
that
he
could
have
waived,
though
even
there,
i
think,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested,
it's
--
there
is
an
argument
that
an
illiterate
defendant
could
not
competently
and
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
intelligibly
waive
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
right.
it
doesn't
show
that
he
was
advised
of
his
right
to
one.
it
doesn't
show
that
he
requested
one.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
no
reference
in
it
to
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
right.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
it's
not
clear
that
the
whole
record
is
here.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
well,
we
have
a
record
but
it's
not
clear
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
as
far
as
i
know,
we
have
a
whole
all
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
it's
available
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
to
the
state.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
whether
or
not
there
could
be
a
greater
record,
i
don't
know.
perhaps,
counsel
for
the
respondent
could
--
could
answer
that.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
she
has
been
paroled
and
that
i
suspect
is
the
reason
why
her
petition
was
not
pressed
--
not
pressed
here.
she
was
a
party
to
the
proceeding
in
the
florida
supreme
court.
and
subsequent
to
that
time
but
prior
to
the
petition
for
a
--
what
this
court
treated
as
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
here,
she
was
released
on
parole.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
yes,
sir,
i
--
i
believe
it
does.
there
are
those
allegations
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
certainly,
prior
to
the
time
he
was
arrested,
there's
no
question
he
was
indigent.
and
it
seems
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
unlikely
to
me
that
he
could
have
raised
funds
between
november
5th,
1957
and
september
19th,
1958
during
which
time
he
was
in
jail
for
the
full
10-month
period.
i
think
that's
true
and
i
think,
also,
i
was
going
to
note
in
this
return
to
the
respondent's
return
set
forth
on
page
70
of
the
record.
petitioner
comes
close
as
to
saying
directly
that
he
is
indi
--
indigent.
he
says
further
the
record
shows
that
two
proficient
prosecutors
were
arrayed
against
these
indigent
and
uneducated
defendants.
so
he's
--
he's
saying
that
there,
i
believe,
and
i
believe
that
issue
is
clearly
here
by
the
record
and
that
this
court,
i
would
respectfully
submit,
should
reexamine
betts
versus
brady
or
at
least
provide
guidance
as
to
how
the
rule
of
betts
versus
brady
can
now
be
applied
in
state
criminal
proceedings
in
view
of
the
holding
in
griffin
and
in
chandler
versus
fretag.
but
certainly,
i
do
not
suggest
that
that
is
essential
in
order
to
find
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
since
i
believe
he
falls
under
the
circumstances
of
the
cases
following
betts
versus
brady.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
and
your
honor,
there
is
not,
so
far
as
i
can
determine
from
this
record
the
type
of
suggestion
that
has
often
been
present
of
--
of
possible
insanity
defense
or
anything
bordering
on
that.
there's
no
suggestion
that
there
was
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
for
low
intelligence?
well,
there
is
of
course
the
trial
transcript
itself
and
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
is
set
forth
verbatim
in
that
transcript
which
i
believe
manifestly
indicates
low
intelligence.
it
borders
on
the
incoherent.
there's
that.
then
of
course
there
is
the
allegation
of
the
petition
that
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
that
the
petitioners
were
--
that
neither
possessed
the
most
elementary
rudiments
of
criminal
procedure
or
foreknowledge
with
which
to
conduct
the
defense
that
petition
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
spelled
f-o-r-e-k-n-o-w
too.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
i
guess
it
--
i
guess
it
is.
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
word.
there's
also
an
allegation
that
petitioner
has
completely
without
education
and
cannot
recount
the
abcs.
there
was
an
allegation
that
his
wife
possessed
a
minimal
6th
grade
education.
perhaps
that
means
she
got
to
the
6th
grade
but
didn't
pass.
but
then
again
in
the
return,
there's
an
allegation
that
the
defendants
were
totally
unable
to
conduct
their
defense.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
there
was
an
allegation
in
the
return
to
the
respondent's
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
return
that
--
i'll
see
if
i
can
quote
it
here,
“the
entire
record
reflects
the
ignorance
and
the
total
inability
of
the
petitioners
to
examine
witnesses
or
in
any
way
defend
themselves
and
elaborately
portrays
the
issues
involved
in
the
petition.”
it's
on
page
71
of
the
return
of
the
petitioners.
there
isn't,
however,
as
far
as
i
can
determine,
any
--
any
possible
or
any
--
any
direct
evidence
of
lack
of
--
or
the
possibility
that
insanity
would
have
been
a
defense
at
the
trial.
now,
it's
quite
possible
that
petitioner
had
had
a
lawyer
and
he
had
requested
a
psychological
or
a
psychiatric
examination
as
he
had
a
right
to
do
under
chapter
801
of
the
florida
statutes
that
a
--
an
examination
of
that
sort
might
very
well
have
--
have
showed
that
this
petitioner
was
not
only
illiterate,
uneducated,
ignorant,
unable
to
express
himself.
but
that
in
addition,
in
fact,
he
was
possibly
insane,
legally
insane
at
the
time
the
acts
were
allegedly
committed.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
now,
i
certainly
would
not
claim
to
be
the
lawyer
that
you're
talking
about,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
it's
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
--
it's
possible
--
it's
at
least
conceivable
to
me
that
had
a
lawyer
been
present,
that
some
totally
unexpected
response
might
have
come
to
a
question
that
would
have
opened
an
entire
line
of
inquiry
that
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
you've
qualified.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
right.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
well,
it
certainly
was.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
one
additional
point
that
i
failed
to
mention.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
this
being
a
jury
trial,
petitioner
didn't,
of
course,
did
not
have
counsel
in
a
jury
trial.
in
every
previous
opinion
of
this
court
so
far
as
i
can
determine
from
the
printed
opinions
and
i
have
not
examined
the
records,
in
each
previous
case
of
this
sort
where
the
defendant
has
been
faced
with
a
necessity
for
a
jury
trial,
this
court
has
found
circumstances
amounting
to
a
denial
of
due
process.
in
other
words,
there's
never
been
a
jury
trial
case
where
the
defendant
represented
himself
regardless
of
the
other
circumstances
where
this
court
has
not
found
a
denial
of
due
process.
i
would
certainly
hope
that
this
would
not
be
the
first,
particularly
since
there
are
circumstances
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
jury
trial.
now,
betts
versus
brady
was
a
trial
situation
but
it
was
not
a
jury
trial
situation.
it
was
a
trial
before
the
judge.
and
so
far
as
i
am
aware,
there's
been
no
jury
trial
where
this
court
has
found
other
than
that
denial
of
due
process
was
present
when
the
defendant
represented
himself.
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
call
court's
attention
to,
of
course,
the
case
that
i
probably
should
have
started
with
but
didn't,
powell
versus
alabama,
which
i
believe
is
highly
persuasive
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned.
this,
of
course,
is
not
a
capital
case.
it
is
a
case
though
which
like
powell,
involved
illiteracy
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
and
as
mr.
justice
sutherland,
i
think,
put
it
very
out
eloquently
and
has
been
quoted
a
number
of
times
in
that
case.
if
we
cannot
expect
even
the
educated
layman
to
meet
some
of
the
issues
which
may
be
involved
at
the
trial,
we
certainly
cannot
expect
an
illiterate
defendant
to
meet
those
issues.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
no,
your
honor,
that
--
when
i
referred
to
return
there,
i
was
referring
to
the
petitioner's
return
to
the
states
return.
and
i
was
quoting
from
page
71
of
the
record,
which
is
in
his
return
to
the
return
in
which
the
petitioner
alleges
that
he
was
in
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
no,
sir,
though
there's
--
i
think
that
reading
up
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion
as
a
whole
makes
the
third
florida
supreme
court
be
in
this
petitioner
as
an
indigent.
the
court
at
one
point
refers
to
the
poverty,
i
believe
--
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
yes,
the
--
the
law
of
the
state
does
not
require
that
the
state
appoint
counsel
to
represent
indigent
defendants
so
the
florida
supreme
court
treated
him
as
indigent.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
nothing
further
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court
that
i've
overlooked
--
matters
i
overlooked.
mr.
harold
a.
ward,
iii
thank
you,
your
honor.
