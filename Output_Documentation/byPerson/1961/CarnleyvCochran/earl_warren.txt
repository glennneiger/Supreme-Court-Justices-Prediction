if
a
man
couldn't
read,
how
could
--
how
could
he
challenged
this
indictment?
chief

would
he
know
that?
chief

earl
warren
(voice

an
equal

issue
for
the
wealthy
in
this
matter?
chief
justice

is
that
what
you're
doing?

mr.

chief

is
the
whole

here?
chief

here?
chief

yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
is
it
the
practice
of
your
court
to
advice
an
attorney
that
if
he
doesn't
have
counsel,
he
can
get
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
advice
him?
the
court
doesn't
advice
him?
that's
what
i'm
asking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
i
mean
a
man
comes
up
before
the
court
on
arraignment
charged
with
--
with
felony
and
he
has
no
counsel
and
does
the
court
say
to
him,
“do
you
have
counsel
mr.
so
and
so?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
can't
quite
hear
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
do
your
courts
in
--
infer
to
do
by
way
of
advising
the
defendant
of
his
rights
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
do
not
advice
him
concerning
a
right
to
counsel
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
record
--
does
this
record
show
that
he
was
advised
in
all
those
sayings
that
you
have
just
mentioned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
the
way
through,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
--
chief
justice

we'll
recess
now,

mr.

you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief

mr.
mahorner
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
run
in
--
in
conflict
with
griffin
versus
illinois
and
burns
versus
ohio
and
herman
versus
claudy
in
the
arguments
you've
just
made
about
denying
people
who
do
have
means
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
when
we
give
that
service
to
the
--
to
the
indigent?

yes,
i
would
say.
chief

burns

had
to
do
with
fees
for
--
exactly
for
–
for
appeal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
understood,
you
originally
no
--
no
defendant
was
entitled
to
counsel
and
now
the
state
has
provided
for
counsel,
permits
counsel
in
all
cases,
and
if
it
does,
why
--
why
doesn't
the
principle
of
griffin
apply?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
no
statute
in
florida
which
gives
a
man
a
right
to
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
no
you
can
answer
it
in
your
own
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
mr.
mahorner.
mr.
ward.
chief
justice
earl

ab

the
burden
representing

our
request.

we're
always

we
appreciate
the
