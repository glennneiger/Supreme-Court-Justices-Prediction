justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
do
suggest
that
we
should
dispose
of
it
here
finally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
hearing
on
this
habeas
corpus?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
we
get
the
fact
you
mean
from
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
they
admit
them
or
they
--
they
in
fact
admit
them
for
purposes
of
consideration?
in
fact,
the
admission
is
a
demurral,
it
seems,
suppose
all
this
is
so.
i
didn't
get
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
we
can't
assume
that
those
are
facts
found.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
not
disputed
as
a
fact.
i
just
--
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
situation
is.
if
there
is
any
kind
of
contest
that
if
the
state
comes
up
here,
and
the
state
is
here,
the
state
will
say
yes.
we
submit
at
this
court
all
these
things
that
mr.
ward
said
as
so,
and
not
in
the
realm
of
legal
argument
but
there
is
so
(inaudible).
but
otherwise,
if
the
state
court,
i'm
a
little
surprised,
and
the
state
court
simply
says,
“we
don't
have
to
give
a
hearing”
that
implies
that
there
is
some
contest
about
the
question
of
--
some
issues
of
fact
but
they
--
as
i've
said,
they
deal
with
it
as
though
it's
a
demurral
in
all
common
law
declaration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
come
with
that
mr.
ward?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
trying
to
come
to
that
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
mind
is
exposed
you
know
as
i
read
it.
it
said,
was
everything
you
say
so
and
so
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
isn't
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
why
isn't
there
any
circumstances
would
he
get
an
immediate
discharge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
maybe
so
--
maybe
so,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
--
can't
(inaudible)
grant
a
new
trial
or
it
found
--
find
the
first
judgment
vitiated
by
unconstitutional
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
element?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
double
jeopardy
if
the
defendant
himself
raises
the
question,
anything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wouldn't
--
but
--
but
your
suggestion
that
we
should
discharge
him
now
pitched
out
of
florida's
power
the
right
to
grant
a
new
trial.
is
it
further
(inaudible)
to
the
other
point,
whether
or
not
he
would
be
admitted
to
bail
pending
the
second
trial,
how
can
we
dispose
of
all
these
questions
here
on
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
theory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
if
this
court,
it's
frequently
the
united
states
discharges
him
then
you
might
--
then
you
really
raise
the
question
of
--
might
really
raise
the
question
of
double
jeopardy.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
any
event,
although
we
to
determine
whether
he
should
be
let
out
on
bail
in
the
meantime
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
simply
because
--
because
on
habeas
corpus,
the
conviction
would
upset.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
we
take
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
we
take
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
if
we
discharge
him,
he's
out
on
bail.0
he's
out
freely,
isn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
meantime,
if
we
discharge
him,
he's
out
free,
when
if
this
case
goes
back
to
florida,
florida
may
decide
to
try
him
again
so
far
as
(inaudible)
raised
questions
about
bailability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
we
pass
some
of
these
things
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
take
all
these
things
out
--
out
of
the
control
of
florida?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
i'd
put
it
to
you.
i
would
think
they're
involved.
if
this
court
discharges
him,
he
gets
out
of
jail,
he's
free
for
the
time
being
and
therefore,
the
state
has
to
move
to
--
to
take
appropriate
steps
to
get
him
back.
in
the
meantime,
it
might
not
be
able
to
get
him
back.
bail
is,
of
course,
the
normal
constitutional
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
know
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ward,
you're
suggesting
the
statement
until
you
frustrate
the
order
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
all
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
these
suggest
entanglements
between
this
court
and
--
and
state
--
(inaudible)
state
officials.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
necessarily
so.
i
put
it
to
you.
you
say
they'll
have
somebody
out
there
with
a
capias
as
soon
as
uncle
sam
has
opened
the
jail
door.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could.
and
i
can
see
some
editorials
and
some
quarters
talking
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
what
you've
suggested
you
might
want.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
i'm
agreeable
to
that
if
we
reverse.
that's
what
we
do
even
as
to
deportation
cases
but
we
don't
say
that
the
prisoner
is
discharged.
what
we
do
say
is
that
a
right
of
his
has
been
invaded
and
we
won't
issue.
we'll
do
the
opposite
of
discharging
him.
we
leave
open
ample
opportunities
for
the
state
on
federal
cases,
a
federal
procedure
to
exhibit
its
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
quite
impressing
to
the
argument,
your
client
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
very
well,
mr.
ward,
that
when
this
court
in
state
cases
does
reverse,
the
mandate
goes
down
and
so
far
as
mandate
do
go
down
and
simply
reverse
what
the
state
court
does
leaving
it
to
the
state
courts
to
make
such
disposition
as
state
law
requires.
this
is
a
very
different
thing
from
opening
the
jail
door.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ward,
i'm
contested
that
the
requested
counsel
was
denied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
sufficient
reason.
if
the
lower
court
--
if
the
supreme
--
your
supreme
court
has
not
withstand
at
the
sufficient
reasons
about
determining
that
fact
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
before
the
--
for
establishing
that
fact,
before
the
part
had
argued
because
this
court
has
held
it
certainly
not
unconstitutional
for
a
man
to
refuse
to
have
counsel.you
had
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
had
choked
of
counsel
down
his
throat.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
that
--
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
say
he
was
incapable
of
making
such
a
judgement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
denying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
those
are
all
(inaudible)
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
show
that
we
have
the
whole
record
of
everything
that
took
place
in
your
trial
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
need
(inaudible)
at
a
record
anywhere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
a
record
but
we
haven't
--
the
--
the
record
of
what
took
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ward,
across
from
the
state
of
florida
law
in
relation
to
the
crimes
for
which
he
was
tried
and
on
which
he
was
--
ways
on
which
he
was
convicted
is
that
--
apart
from
that
and
conceding
and
of
course,
apart
from
the
fact
that
he
was
illiterate,
meaning
that
he
couldn't
read
nor
write.
leaving
illiteracy
--
illiterate
know
--
thought
of
contents
with
that,
what
--
what
allegations
are
there
after
his
mental
state,
his
intellectual
mental
norm
under
which
so
many
of
the
cases
since
betts
and
brady
has
gone
that
the
--
the
composition
of
the
court
(inaudible)
what
is
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
low
intelligence,
what
is
there
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
illiterate
talk
about
foreknowledge,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
all
of
--
i
mean
all
of
things
down
reasonable
and
fair
and
also
that
the
florida
law
maybe
such.
the
lawyer
could
have
done
things
with
the
difficulties
of
the
law
and
tried
that
he
did
it
at
least.
but
except
on
the
assumption
that
the
--
his
child's
testimony
could
be
broken
down
(inaudible)
suppose.
i
don't
think
the
crappiest
lawyer
in
the
world
could
have
done
anything
to
that
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
it
unless
i
--
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
qualified
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unless
--
unless
the
girl
is
a
mature
girl
(inaudible)
you
may
well
have
been.
there
was
a
particularity
about
it
then
i
should
think
would
have
--
would
have
challenged
even
the
most
eager
lawyer
to
discredit
a
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
repeat
that
last
sentence,
if
this
had
been
here
a
year
ago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
very
sure
of
your
starting
point,
justice

know,
namely

mapp

justice

as
long

we've
got
your
point,
you
don't
need
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm

i
must
have
missed
something.
what

what
benefit
does

what
is
your
law
regarding

what
are
the
consequences
of
taking
an

what
does

get?
justice

what
about
the
$100
against
$200?
you
mentioned
as
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
such
prisoners
--
how
many
in
such
incarcerations
you
think
there
are
in
florida?
justice

i'm
not
talking
about
mapp.
i'm
talking
about
failure
to
assign
