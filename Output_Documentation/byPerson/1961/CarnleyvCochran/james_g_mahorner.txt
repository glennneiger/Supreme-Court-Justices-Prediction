mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
james
mahorner,
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
florida.
we
represent
the
appellee,
mr.
cochran,
he's
head
of
our
division
of
correction,
in
this
particular
course.
the
--
firstly,
in
order
to
lay
the
foundation
for
the
argument
we
have
to
go
to
as
what
was
the
general
characteristic
of
the
overall
proceedings
in
this
case.
now,
the
presumption
is
on
the
petitioner
here
and
it's
fair
for
the
court
to
assume
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
judge
and
the
prosecution
were
in
rapport
with
the
defendant
as
far
as
complete
fair
play,
unless
the
record
shows
something
else.
now,
just
as
a
sideline,
we
have
--
which
has
no
bear
in
direct
judge
has
written
division
of
correction
on
behalf
of
this
petitioner.
thus,
he
had
no
strong
animosity
towards
this
petitioner.
for
the
court
to
come
to
this
conclusion,
i
asked
only
that
they
consider
the
record
as
before
us.
i
feel
as
i
go
down
what
occurred
in
this
trial,
the
court
will
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
any
of
the
individuals
on
this
court
had
been
sitting
as
judge
on
that
case
that
they
could
have
done
more
--
no
more
except
for
the
appointment
of
counsel.
they
could
have
done
no
more
than
that
particular
judge
did.
i
also
feel
that
it
will
be
shown
that
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
your
honor,
that
--
that
would
be
his
point.
but
my
point
is
that
under
betts
versus
brady,
if
everything
in
the
overall
proceedings
is
completely
fair
to
the
defendant
and
the
only
factor
is
the
lack
of
counsel.
then
such
factor
will
not
be
sufficient
to
reverse
the
case.
so
our
first
approach
is
to
show
that
all
the
factors
are
fair
except
that
one
point
of
failure
to
appoint
counsel.
first,
we
look
at
the
record
on
page
31
to
explain
to
the
defendants
if
they
have
the
right
to
make
an
opening
statement,
that
they
can
sit
back
and
wait
until
the
state
makes
their
case
and
then
they
can
make
an
opening
statement
to
the
jury
before
placing
on
their
defense.
the
defendant
chose
to
--
to
wait.
they
will
later
be
shown
if
they
did
make
an
opening
statement
to
the
jury
before
they
put
on
their
defense.
the
defendants
did
cross-examine
as
shown
on
page
41
and
47.
counsel
for
petitioner
has
shown
that
such
a
cross-examination
was
very
brief.
however,
the
court
has
pointed
out
that
it's
possible
that
no
attorney
could
have
done
more
but
the
big
factor
is
it
is
quite
possible
that
many
attorneys
would
have
come
to
an
independent
conclusion,
“let's
not
cross-examine
this
witness
to
a
further
extent
to
get
this
exact
testimony
before
the
jury.”
and
what
was
done
by
a
petitioner
or
about
--
was
that
which
might
have
been
done
by
many
attorneys
to
what
not
furthering
the
evidence
of
the
prosecution
witness.
now,
what
did
petitioner
temp
to
do
in
this
cross-examination?
he
attempted
to
do
this.
he
wanted
to
show
that
there
was
an
inconsistency
on
what
the
witness
said
to
what
the
witness
said
that
he
was
alone
whether
that
her
mother
was
in
another
section
of
--
of
the
community.
he
wanted
to
show
that
that
was
not
the
case.
he
laid
the
foundation
and
later
on
in
his
testimony,
he
brings
out
this
to
support
it.
now,
there
is
no
inflammatory
comment
by
the
prosecution.
when
they
attempt
to
bring
out
another
crime
on
page
49,
it
simply,
“had
you
been
convicted
of
another
crime?”
“yes.”
“how
many?”
“one.”
no
further
whatsoever,
not
--
no
dwelling
on
it,
always
it's
just
--
there's
nothing
to
stir
up
animosity
between
the
jury
and
this
man
which
the
prosecution
does
in
his
cross-examination.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
appreciate
the
correction
with
--
from
the
court
there.
yes,
sir,
it
was
brought
out
further
on
cross-examination.
the
right
not
to
testify
was
explained
in
detail
to
the
defendant,
his
constitutional
right
not
to
incriminate
himself
which
explained
on
page
49
of
the
record.
now,
keep
in
mind
that
all
of
these
arguments
about
what
a
counsel
might
have
done
as
the
same
arguments
that
could
be
used
if
counsel
was
present
to
say,
“what
could
better
counsel
have
done?”
now,
the
explanation
of
the
closing
and
opening
rights
for
making
the
argument
to
the
jury
was
given
in
detail
by
the
court
on
the
record
on
page
61
of
the
case.
they
made
arguments
to
the
jury
as
shown
by
the
record
on
page
62
of
the
case.
in
the
charge
on
page
62,
the
court
put
out
in
detail
how
the
burden
was
on
the
state
to
prove
and
how
there
had
to
be
beyond
unreasonable
doubt
and
on
the
record
in
page
68,
a
coercion
the
jury
not
to
consider
testimony
given
for
impeachment
as
indic
--
indication
of
the
guilt
of
the
defendant.
we
therefore
submit
that
when
we
consider
the
overall
proceedings
of
this
trial,
the
judge
did
every
thing
possible
that
any
judge
could
do
except
the
appointment
of
counsel.
and
that
the
one
lack
of
fair
play
in
this
trial
is
the
failure
to
appoint
counsel.
and
we're
now
going
to
go
into
the
considerations
given
to
betts
versus
brady
and
whether
this
case
should
be
reversed.
we
feel
that,
as
of
this
point,
the
case
falls
under
betts
v.
brady.
furthermore,
in
betts
v.
brady
there
was
at
least
support
for
the
indigents
of
the
defendant.
there
is
no
support
in
this
record
as
far
as
not
the
testimony
is
concerned
but
as
far
as
the
allegations
of
the
defendant
that
he
was
indigent.
he
certainly
didn't
make
it
in
his
petition.
they
have
attempted
to
rely
on
a
statement
and
what
is
essentially
a
reply
brief.
and
that
statement
is
that
is
shown
by
the
record
that
two
strong
attorneys
were
aligned
against
these
indigent
uneducated
defendants.
certainly,
a
denial
of
such
statement
does
not
come
to
issue
of
the
indigents
of
the
defendant.
the
statement
is,
as
to
whether
the
attorneys
were
there.
now,
the
first
reason
that
we
do
not
think
this
betts
v.
brady
should
be
reversed
in
this
particular
case
is
because
of
the
effect
this
court
has
given
the
mapp
v.
ohio
decision.
now,
in
the
mapp
v.
ohio
decision
where
the
court
reversed
these
prior
holdings
on
the
evidence
of
miscibility
of
illegally
obtained
evidence
in
state
courts,
the
court
here
was
confronted
with
not
a
collateral
attack
on
the
judgement
--
not
a
collateral
attack
on
the
judgement
but
a
direct
proceeding,
appellate
proceeding
on
the
judgement.
the
court
has
refused
to
apply
that
change
of
law,
that
change
of
law
to
convictions
that
took
place
before
the
mapp
holding,
the
federal
system
has.
therefore,
we
have
here
the
situation
where
if
we
were
to
change
betts
v.
brady,
if
we
had
changed
betts
v.
brady
one
year
ago,
this
petitioner
could
not
here
be
attacking
his
lack
of
counsel
and
the
urging
that
betts
v.
brady
had
been
reversed.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
if
--
if
another
case
had
been
before
the
court
a
year
ago
and
they
had
reversed
betts
v.
brady
as
they
made
to
reverse
the
prior
opinions
in
mapp
v.
ohio
where
this
petitioner
here
was
convicted
prior
to
the
reversal,
this
petitioner
could
not
today
be
relying
on
habeas
corpus
to
overthrow
his
conviction
on
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i'm
arguing
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
made
them
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
it
was
my
understanding
that
in
the
lower
court,
it
had
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
--
i
did
understand
that
but
i
understood
--
well,
i'll
drop
as
long
as
i've
made
the
point
if
the
--
if
the
original
started
wrong,
the
whole
point
assert
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
--
whole
point
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
--
assert
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
thank
you.
now,
if
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
in
all
cases
involving
liberty,
the
same
would
go
of
course
to
traffic
cases
because
certainly
an
indigent
defendant
isn't
going
to
have
the
alternative
of
paying
a
fine.
furthermore,
as
this
court
here
is
not
by
constitutional
mandate
require
to
sit
as
attorneys.
the
defendant
is
not
constitutionally
entitled
to
have
attorneys
sitting
on
his
appeal
to
this
court.
it
certainly
followed
that
he
is
not
constitutionally
entitled
to
have
attorney,
judges
at
any
level
since
certainly
if
the
highest
level
is
not
required
to
be
attorneys,
no
level
is.
we,
therefore,
find
that
the
jury
cannot
be
attorneys,
the
court
might
not
be
attorneys
and
yet,
we
have
this
insistence
on
the
sanctity
of
having
attorneys
in
the
case.
the
constitution
doesn't
recognize
to
give
such
recognition
to
attorneys.
you
cannot
argue
that
you're
constitutionally
entitled
to
that
which
the
constitution
does
not
ensure
the
existence
of.
many
years
ago,
this
was
held
constitutional.
certain
statutes
were
above
the
states
and
said
you
could
be
represented
by
anybody
of
your
choice.
these
undermine
the
legal
profession.
you
didn't
have
to
have
us
legal
education
to
represent
someone.
you
didn't
have
to
be
an
attorney.
these
laws
were
upheld
as
constitutional.
the
constitution
does
not
give
any
mandate
that
attorneys
will
exist.
now,
as
far
as
--
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
he
always
has
a
prerogative
to
have
an
indictment
read
to
him,
your
honor,
always.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
well,
the
law
is
often
confronted
with
the
ignorance
of
the
defendant
and
that's
why
they've
taken
this
presumption
of
law
that
you
understand,
that
you
have
the
general
knowledge
of
it
because
if
you
have
to
go
on
the
specific,
whether
the
man
actually
knows
there
are
not,
there's
confusion
that
results
in
many
cases.
now,
as
far
as
the
argument,
we
let
rich
have
attorneys
why
not
let
the
poor
have
it?
and
--
and
making
that
argument
petitioner
relied
first
on
fretag.
in
fretag,
there
was
a
request
for
counsel
or
request
to
given
time
to
obtain
counsel,
any
case
wherein
there's
a
request
for
the
ability
to
obtain
counsel
on
your
own
as
completely
distinguished
before
the
case
here.
we
acknowledge
that
you
have
the
right
to
have
your
own
counsel
there
if
you
can
get
it.
now,
suppose
you
give
this
right
to
the
poor,
so
to
speak,
and
you
find
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
have
an
attorney,
to
have
an
attorney,
without
commenting
on
its
app
--
on
the
application
of
this
reasoning
to
the
constitutional
right
of
appeal.
let's
first
look
at
this.
if
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
an
attorney,
and
if
you
have
money
regardless
of
whether
you're
rich,
just
if
you
have
money,
you
must
pay
$100
attorney
fee
and
understand
attorney's
fees
are
low
in
florida
or
$200
attorney's
fees.
where
if
you
have
no
money,
if
you
have
no
money,
you
paid
no
fee,
you
are
in
effect
fined,
in
effect
fined.
you
lose
a
property
right
that
is
the
money
to
exercise
the
privilege
even
though
you
aren't
exercising
a
greater
privilege.
now,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
progressive
income
tax.
if
you
earn
more
income,
you're
getting
a
greater
privilege
or
greater
protection.
but
here,
you
get
the
same
attorney
in
either
case,
in
all
probability
that
certainly
can
come
out
that
way.
and
yet,
if
you
have
money,
if
you
have
$300,
you
aren't
going
to
be
able
to
take
this
oath
of
being
indigent.
and
you
will
have
to
give
up
that
property
in
order
to
obtain
what
is
urged
by
petitioner
to
be
a
constitutional
right.
now,
furthermore
when
you
speak
of
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
when
you
speak
of
an
appeal,
the
man
must
swear
under
oath
to
the
court
and
the
burden
is
on
him
to
come
to
the
court,
the
burden
is
on
the
court
to
go
to
him,
must
swear
to
the
court
under
oath
that
he
is
indeed
indigent.
this
man
never
made
any
oath
swearing
to
the
faith
to
this
court.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
he
gets
--
he
gets
the
appellate
record
drawn
up
free
of
charge,
your
honor.
but
in
order
to
get
this
appellate
record
drawn
up
free
of
charge,
he
must
come
to
the
court.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
said
that
attorney's
fees
of
$100
or
$200
one
man.
if
he
has
$300
will
have
to
pay
the
fee,
he
can't
take
the
oath
if
we
apply
this
--
if
we
say
that
you
are
entitled
to
the
counsel.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
thank
you,
sir.
in
order
to
get
this
right
of
appeal,
petitioners
try
to
compare
the
right
of
appeal
on
the
fact
that
you
get
appellate
right
when
you're
poor.
the
courts
have
held
that
the
burden
is
on
petitioner,
on
petitioner
to
come
forward
with
an
oath
to
the
--
to
the
effect
that
he
is
indigent
and
to
establish
his
claim
to
this
right.
so
here,
petitioner
did
not
come
forward
with
any
oath
that
he
was
indigent,
that
he
wanted
counsel
in
the
similar
manner
that
he
would
have
been
require
to
come
forth
that
he
was
going
to
exercise
this
right
of
appeal.
so
if
he
had
done
the
same
thing
for
an
appeal,
he
would
not
have
gotten
--
have
not
have
gotten
the
appeal
under
the
circumstances
present
in
this
case
and
it
follows,
he
certainly
shouldn't
have
gotten
an
attorney
under
the
circumstances
present
in
this
case.
now,
we
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
he
--
the
state
represented
in
the
return
on
page
15
that
they
were
submitting
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
at
the
trial.
the
state
has
endeavored
to
submit
everything
that
was
available
on
record
to
the
court
for
its
consideration.
there
was
nothing
whatsoever
that
indicated
that
the
petitioner
had
asked
for
an
attorney.
there
was
an
absence
of
it.
now,
if
petitioner
fails
to
ask
for
an
attorney,
there
will
always
be
such
absence,
there
will
always
be
such
absence.
and
the
states
never
going
to
be
able
to
show
a
record
whereby
it
shown
he
didn't
asked
for
an
attorney.
and
therefore,
they
have
done
everything
possible
to
show
that
he
did.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir,
to
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
everything
that
was
available
--
everything
that
was
of
record
is
here.
and
we
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
sir,
all
i
can
say
to
that,
your
honor,
in
full
candor
is
that
to
our
knowledge,
everything
that
happened
is
here.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
but
that
cannot
say
anymore
in
it.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
no,
sir,
it
isn't.
i
would
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
no,
sir,
there
have
been
cases
where
they
have
appointed-counsel
and
they
do
have
public
defenders
in
many
areas
where
they
appoint
counsel.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
no,
sir,
they
don't
say
--
they
don't
say
that
and
they
don't
say
to
the
same
man,
“do
you
want
to
make
an
appeal
and
are
you
too
poor
to
make
one?”
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
they
don't
say
that,
your
honor.
but
the
analogy
is
also
they
are
not
required
to
say
to
that
man
after
the
trial.
“are
you
too
poor
to
make
an
appeal
and
do
you
have
one?”
it
is
on
him
to
make
the
move
on
these
appeal
cases.
he
must
make
the
motion
and
show
that
he
wants
an
appeal
and
he's
indigent.
and
so
it
should
at
least
be
on
him
to
make
the
move
to
show
that
he
wants
counsel,
same
analogy
we
feel
and
that
he
is
indigent.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
they
are
always
in
detail
about
not
we're
being
required
to
testify
against
himself.
as
the
record
shows
to
some
extent,
the
normal
--
that
some
of
florida
courts
are
--
are,
you
know,
not
cosmopolitan.
the
record
shows
a
very
uncosmopolitan
court
but
a
relatively
fair
proceeding
in
the
record
here
which
is
typical.
he
advised
him
detail
of
man's
right
not
to
testify,
same
time
he
advised
him
detail
of
his
right
to
testify.
he
showed
him
that
he
could
make
an
opening
argument
and
a
closing
and
under
what
circumstances
he
would
lose
opening
and
closing.
he
showed
that
he
could
make
an
opening
statement
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
to
the
jury.
they're
advised
all
the
way
through
of
anything
that
an
attorney
should
know
and
would
need
to
know
with
that
particular
point
in
proceedings.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
no,
sir,
because
under
betts
v.
brady,
they
do
not
have
a
standard
right
to
counsel
so
of
course
they
couldn't
advice
him.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
even
there,
it
is
possible
that
we
are
exceeding
this
court
because
in
the
case
of
powell
v.
alabama,
which
is
relied
on
for
an
attorney,
which
is
relied
on
for
the
proposition
that
attorney
is
needed
in
the
capital
case.
nowhere
do
they
hold
in
that
case
the
fact
the
case
is
capital
is
the
deciding
factor.
the
case
itself
says
the
fact
that
it
--
the
--
the
(inaudible)
make
sure
the
crime.
they
go
on
the
idea
of
the
youthfulness
of
the
defendants
referred
to
--
in
fact
the
record
referred
to
him
as
boys
and
on
the
factor
that
they
were
on
a
hostile
community
and
indigent
and
ignorant.
and
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
that
the
law
of
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
absolute
right.
now,
this
right
attempted
to
show
that
--
that
the
right
to
appeal
if
we
make
this
similar
to
the
right
of
appeal
where
you
have
to
be
given
that
right
and
that
the
burden
is
on
the
petitioner
to
show
his
need
for
the
right
and
the
court
has
no
duty
to
point
out
that
he
has
the
right
and
therefore,
the
same
analogy
should
be
present
here.
we
also
believe
that
this
is
similar
to
a
jury
trial
requirement.
this
is
a
procedural
requirement
of
a
criminal
proceeding.
very
similar
to
jury
trial
and
is
in
fact
located,
if
i
remember
correctly,
in
the
same
part
of
the
constitution.
the
court
has
held
that
this
proceeding
--
that
jury
proceeding
is
not
required
of
the
states
if
they
have
great
discretion
in
the
exercise
of
criminal
procedure.
and
certainly,
where
the
similarity
between
jury
and
the
counsel
here,
the
two
were
very
comparable
and
these
too
is
a
procedural
aspect
that
the
court
should
be
given
great
discretion
unless
they
denied
the
man's
right
to
a
hearing.
now,
we
urge
if
the
man
is
feeble-minded,
if
the
man
is
in
fact
below
21,
if
the
man
for
any
factor
other
than
education,
cannot
represent
himself,
let's
take
people
not
mind
in
this,
in
minority,
a
court
very
likely
would
point
a
guardian
in
a
civil
trial.
as
understood,
the
man
doesn't
--
can't
represent
himself
and
that
a
hearing
from
himself
is
not
a
hearing
from
--
of
his
course.
but
this
particular
man
here
is
given
full
recognition
under
the
law.
he
is
entitled
by
this
constitution
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
except
for
the
manner
of
vote.
there
is
no
educational
requirement
whatsoever
for
him
to
hold
that
post.
as
i've
said
he
could
be
on
this
court.
education
is
not
given
constitutional
recognition.
the
very
--
we
feel
the
very
beginning
that
we
feel
now
education
might
possibly
over
emphasized
and
certainly
in
the
beginning
when
the
constitutional
was
developed,
and
now,
the
requirements
that
you
have
in
education
are
very
few
in
this
constitution
and
that
shown
not
for
for
this
court
or
not
for
presidential
office.
now,
when
his
right
to
counsel
that's
developing
under
the
sixth
amendment,
anyone
had
a
provision
as
long
as
--
as
far
as
1838
that
you
could
have
no
counsel
come
into
court
to
represent
you
in
a
felony
charge.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
thank
you.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
attempted
to
illustrate
that
there
are
no
unu
--
unusual
happenings
in
the
trial
of
the
present
petitioner
which
indicates
an
unfairness
on
the
part
of
the
court
or
the
prosecution.
there
is
not
alleged
any
feeble
not
--
or
youthfulness
by
the
petitioner.
there's
one
other
factor
that
should
be
considered
before
this
court
--
before
this
case
can
be
said
to
be
within
the
betts
v.
brady
ground,
and
that
is
whether
this
particular
charge,
or
the
particular
charge
of
the
incest
child
fondling
was
so
complex
that
it
required
a
counsel
to
represent
the
petitioner,
otherwise,
he
was
not
given
fair
play.
now,
there
were
some
supposed
complexities
in
this
charge.
the
petitioner
was
indicted
on
two
counts,
incest
and
child
fondling.
it
could
be
said
that
it
should
have
been
only
one
crime.
a
coun
--
counsel
could
have
require
--
might
have
persuaded
the
court
to
sentence
on
only
one
crime,
but
it
was
decided
in
the
petitioners
favor
by
sentencing
petitioner
within
the
permissible
term
allowed
under
either
count
rather
than
sentencing
petitioner
two
consecutive
--
to
two
consecutive
terms,
one
under
each
count.
now,
it's
been
brought
up
that
the
court
had
the
discretion
of
giving
psychiatric
treatment
to
the
petitioner.
however,
it
is
not
alleged
and
it
is
not
the
case
that
such
psychiatric
treatment
is
in
lieu
of
sentence.
it's
in
addition
to
sentence.
it
is
something
that
takes
place
before
sentencing.
before
trial,
the
man
still
goes
on
trial.
the
court
could
have
exercised
this
discretion
to
--
to
give
psychiatric
treatment
that
the
man
had
no
legal
right
to
psychiatric
treatment.
there
is
always
present
an
element
of
discretion
in
the
court.
the
court
could
have
sentenced
the
man
to
only
one
year,
but
the
question
of
complexity
comes
up
not
in
discretion,
but
where
--
where
the
court,
where
we
have
a
legal
issue,
where
it
becomes
mandatory
on
the
court
to
give
this
man
a
sentence
on
only
one
count
because
the
two
counts
constitute
one,
where
possibly
there
is
no
crime
for
assault
to
commit
second
degree
murder,
where
there
is
a
legal
right
involved
and
not
where
there's
a
discretionary
right
involved.
and
we
say
here
that
there
was
no
unusual
dis
--
legal
right
involved
which
was
not
in
the
ultimate
decided
in
favor
of
petitioner.
furthermore,
in
the
case
of
bute
v.
illinois,
the
same
crime
was
before
the
court
--
before
this
court.
and
there
was
no
finding
that
this
--
this
type
of
crime
involves
such
complexities
that
a
counsel
per
se
was
needed.
now,
we
are
faced
--
we
feel
at
this
point
that
all
we
have
is
that
conceding
for
the
sake
of
argument,
the
petitioner
did
successfully
alleged
indigent
so
i
brought
it
up
that
it
was
not
alleged
in
his
original
petition
and
it's
somewhat
ambiguously
alleged
in
his
reply
brief
in
reply
to
our
response.
but
assuming
that
he's
alleged
in
a
--
and
assuming
that
he's
successfully,
which
he
definitely
has
alleged
lack
of
education,
we
have
no
other
factors
which
do
not
coincide
with
betts
v.
brady.
in
betts
the
man
was
indigent.
in
betts
the
man
who
was
a
farm
laborer
as
indicated
by
the
dissent
which
is
certainly
valid
for
supp
--
supporting
the
factual
situation
surrounding
the
case.
the
indication
is,
though
not
direct,
the
man
as
a
farm
laborer
did
not
have
a
great
deal
of
education.
we
now
come
to
whether
betts
v.
brady
should
be
overruled.
yesterday,
i
had
attempted
to
lay
what
turned
out
to
be
a
fallacious
argument
because
my
original
premise
was
wrong
and
ideas
that
mapp
v.
ohio
did
not
have
a
retrospect
effect.
we
do
just
want
to
say
in
passing
that
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
release
every
man
who
is
now
serving
any
sentence
no
matter
whether
they
were
convicted
20
to
60
to
70
years
ago
if
he's
serving
a
life
sentence
on
the
grounds
that
at
his
trial,
there
was
the
illegably
obtained
evidence
used
or
on
the
grounds
that
at
his
trial,
there
was
lack
of
counsel.
and
they
are
not
prepared
to
give
this
great
retrospect
to
--
effect
to
these
two
cases,
assuming
that
betts
v.
brady
is
reversed,
well
then,
they
cannot
consistently
allow
betts
v.
brady
to
be
reversed
on
collateral
attack
by
habeas
corpus
but
should
wait
until
it's
being
--
until
there
is
a
chance
to
reverse
it
on
direct
attack
by
a
direct
review
of
a
lower
state
decision.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
in
florida,
we
would
not
be
hurt,
your
honor,
at
all
by
mapp
because
we
have
always
proceed
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
would
estimate,
your
honor
that
it
would
probably
be
15%
as
a
very
conservative
estimation.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
of
the
total
amount.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer
that,
your
honor,
with
any
accuracy
at
all.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
would
say
around
7,000.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
we
have
local
legal
aids,
societies
and
cosmopolitan
communities,
but
most
of
our
communities
are
not
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir
in
places
like
tampa
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
no,
he's
a
public
official
by
nature.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
for
cosmopolitan
communities,
your
honor,
but
so
many
of
ours
are
not.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir
for
places
like
tampa
and
for
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
there
is
--
there
is
generally
automatically
assigned
but
in
all
candid
of
the
court,
i
have
heard
of
complaints
where
they
do
not
get
the
representation
that
--
at
certain
time,
that's
strictly
hearsay,
but
--
but
as
i
understand
they
are
automatically
assigned.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
no.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
no,
i
mean
by
automatic,
the
court
will
generally
assign
where
the
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
no,
sir,
not
--
it
is
my
understanding
that
they
do
not
have
to
request.
at
the
same
time,
they
won't
be
automatically
reassigned
in
every
case
but
the
court
will
generally
assign.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
when
a
man
comes
up
and
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
when
a
man
comes
up,
you
know,
and
he
gives
the
appearance
of
indigence
where
a
man
comes
up
in
a
suit
maybe
they
wouldn't.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
miami.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i'd
say
around
200.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
he's
just
one
that
i
know
of
--
i
haven't
--
he
might
have
assistance.
that
i
do
not
know
of
--.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
they
probably
would
not,
sir.
there
certainly
isn't
enough
to
go
around
at
this
time
for
the
–
the
backward
places
in
florida
or
they
have
less
cosmopolitan.
now,
we're
faced
with
this
consistent
argument
of
--
and
the
application
of
this
argument
of
where
a
man
is
given
the
right
to
appeal,
he
must
be
given
the
–
the
right
to
appeal
whether
he
is
poor
or
whether
he
is
wealthy.
however,
the
right
to
appeal
is
not
a
constitutional
right.
it
is
something
that
has
been
given
by
the
state.
i
do
not
think
this
court
would
hold
it
that
if
the
constitution
specifically
provided
a
right
to
hold
property
that
the
state
was
now
under
an
obligation
to
give
property
to
those
people
who
did
not
have
property.
there
is
a
stronger
argument
where
the
state
itself
rather
than
in
a
constitution,
where
the
state
tends
to
set
out
the
mechanism
that
there
is
possible
discrimination
if
the
state
does
not
carry
it
on
through,
and
give
it
not
only
to
the
wealthy
but
to
the
poor.
but
here,
if
it's
an
original
right
setup
in
the
constitution,
such
as
property,
could
very
well
be
by
specific
terms
and
possibly
is
by
indirect
terms,
a
direct
specific
term
saying
“you
shall
have
the
sacred
right
to
hold
property.”
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
reasoning
would
prevail
that
the
state
was
now
under
an
obligation
to
give
the
poor
that
right.
and
likewise,
where
the
constitution
said,
“you
shall
have
a
right
to
have
counsel,”
the
state
should
not
be
under
the
obligation
to
give
the
man
that
right
if
he
himself
cannot
acquire
it.
we
feel
that
the
background
of
england
points
that
the
–
the
common
law
background
that
this
constitution
was
originally
constructed
in
points
out
that
what
this
means
in
the
same
way
that
a
term
would
have
manically
were
given
you
the
right
to
hold
property
where
to
meant
that
you
have
the
right
to
acquire
it
if
financially
able
that
in
--
in
england
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
drawn
up
these
amendments
were
put
it
in
as
late
as
1838,
a
man
was
not
allowed
to
come
before
the
court
with
counsel
whatsoever
regardless
of
his
financial
attributes,
and
at
this
provision
the
constitution
was
put
there
for
the
purpose
of
overcoming
this
practice
which
was,
by
the
way,
highly
criticized
in
england
at
that
time.
now,
we
further
feel
that
a
jury
--
the
right
to
jury
could
much
more
readily
be
interpreted
as
being
required
of
the
states
than
the
right
then
that
the
states
be
required
to
appoint
counsel.
not
only
do
you
have
to
–
apply
in
the
counsel
provision,
not
only
do
you
have
to
first
determine
that
you
have
the
right
to
appear
before
a
state
court
with
counsel,
which
you
have
to
do
in
determining
the
jury
issue
that
you
have
this
right
to
appear
before
the
state
court
before
a
jury,
but
you
also
then
have
to
go
the
further
step
of
determining
that
if
the
man
is
indigent,
the
state
must
appoint
counsel.
we
further
feel
that
an
instrument
such
as
the
constitution
which
provides
that
this
man
could
serve
as
president
of
the
united
states
or
it
could
sit
on
this
court
does
not
anticipate
his
being
held
to
be
in
at
able
--
unable
to
defend
himself
when
charged
with
a
crime.
an
instrument
which
gives
him
this
much
recognition
certainly
did
not
intend
that
he
be
held
not
able
to
represent
himself
when
charged
to
the
crime.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir?
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
griffin
v.
illinois
wasn't
a
right
of
appeal,
is
that
correct,
your
honor?
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
right,
right
on
appeal.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
the
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
i've
tried
to
distinguish
that
in
this
manner,
your
honor.
the
right
to
appeal
is
not
given
constitutionally.
it's
given
by
the
state.
it's
something
that
is
given
by
the
state.
if
the
state
sets
it
up
then
perhaps
they
should
be
required
to
care
--
give
it
not
only
to
one
but
to
the
other,
but
i
say
if
the
constitution
makes
a
provision
giving
you
the
right
to
hold
property
that
now
the
state
is
not
required
to
give
you
property
so
that
you
can
exercise
that
right
if
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
don't
have
the
financial
ability
to
acquire
property.
one
place
the
--
the
thing
is
put
in
motion
by
the
state.
the
other
place
is
it's
put
in
motion
by
an
instrument
completely
outside
of
the
state.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
we
feel
that
the
state
is
not
setting
up
this
permission
of
counsel
in
all
cases.
we
feel
that
the
constitution
has
that
–
that
the
provision
of
the
constitution
requiring
counsel
means
--
in
other
words,
you
have
interpreted
different
for
your
system
--
for
your
particular
federal
system
but
you
could
have
done
that
by
rule
of
court,
by
rule
of
procedure.
what
--
but
it
means
that
a
man
does
have
the
right
to
appear
before
the
court
with
counsel
and
we
feel
that
the
state
could
not
remove
this
right,
that
the
sixth
amendment
has
done
that,
but
it
is
something
put
in
effect
by
the
amendment.
it
is
not
something
put
in
effect
by
the
state
such
as
appellate
procedure,
which
is
not
put
in
effect
at
all
by
the
constitution
but
is
only
put
in
by
the
state.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
--
whether
we
did
it
or
not
your
--
excuse
me,
i
don't
mean
to
invade
your
--
your
question
--
your
question.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
because
--
i
have
to
say,
i
--
i
can't
answer
your
question
with
all
sureness
but
that
--
i
would
like
to
go
on
this
approach,
whether
we
did
or
not,
the
actual
motivating
force
is
the
superior
force
which
is
the
constitution
and
the
state
--
the
state
statute
would
be
(inaudible).
now,
if
a
man
is
to
exercise
an
appeal,
he
has
to
come
forward
and
show
that
he
is
indigent,
otherwise,
he
in
effect,
has
waived
that
right.
if
he
does
not
come
forward
of
his
own
without
the
state
in
making
any
inquiries,
if
he
does
not
come
forward
making
oath
of
indigence
then
he
has
effect
waived
that
right.
we
feel
that
under
the
johnson
v.
zerbst
decision,
they
did
not
remand
that
case
because
there
was
lack
of
evidence
that
the
man
had
waived
but
because
there
was
no
finding
that
the
man
had
waived.
and
the
court
here,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
did
make
a
specific
finding
that
the
--
that
the
man
had
waived
his
right
to
counsel
by
not
applying
--
by
not
making
a
specific
application
to
the
court
for
counsel
as
shown
by
the
absence
of
such
application
in
the
record,
in
same
manner
that
he
would
have
waived
any
right
to
appeal
by
not
making
a
specific
application
to
the
court.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
they
are.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
they're
generally
paid
by
the
counties.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
our
--
our
office
has
some
discretion
in
--
in
interpreting
of
the
powers,
and
we
never
interfered
with
that
procedure
at
all.
we
therefore
feel
that
this
particular
case
is
controlled
by
betts
v.
brady
decision,
and
it's
the
best
the
--
that
we
have
given
reasons
why
the
betts
v.
brady
decision
should
not
be
reversed
at
--
at
any
point
and
perhaps
none
at
this
point
and
that
completes
my
argument,
your
honor.
