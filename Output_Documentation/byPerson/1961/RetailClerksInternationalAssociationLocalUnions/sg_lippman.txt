mr.
s.g.
lippman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
labor
case
and
it
arises
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
we
believe
it
presents
a
question
of
far
reaching
importance,
involving
the
interpretation
of
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
which
provides
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
union
representing
employees
and
commerce,
maybe
brought
in
any
district
court
without
any
other
jurisdictional
regard.
the
precise
question
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
a
federal
district
court,
in
this
instance
sitting
in
toledo,
ohio,
may
refuse
to
exercise
jurisdiction
under
section
301
to
enforce
arbitration
awards,
rendered
pursuant
to
a
strike
settlement
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
union
which
represented
some
of
the
employees
of
the
particular
employer.
the
district
court
found
that
they
have
no
jurisdiction,
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
in
what
virtually
amounted
to
a
per
curiam
summary
decision.
the
district
court's
position
was
that
301
is
to
be
given
a
very
limited
and
narrow
application
and
is
only
applicable
where
you
have
two
factors,
one,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
it
did
not
define
and
two,
where
the
union
involved
has
been
accorded
exclusive
bargaining
rights,
presumably
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
this
interpretation,
of
course,
is
a
very
narrow
one
and
excludes
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts,
the
wide
variety
of
contracts
between
labor
unions
and
employers
and
we
think
stultifies
and
frustrates
the
basic
congressional
policy,
which
was
to
open
the
federal
courts,
overcome
the
procedural
difficulties
in
state
courts
for
the
enforcement
of
contracts
so
that
we
could
have
a
regime
perhaps
of
peaceful
settlement
as
a
substitute
to
a
regime
of
industrial
warfare.
now
then,
the
basic
facts
are
these,
if
it
may
please
the
court.
the
local
unions
involved
here
were
the
joined
collective
bargaining
agent,
bargaining
with
a
group
of
employers
on
a
multiple
employer
basis.
it
enjoyed
that
status
for
a
period
of
roughly
20
years,
during
which
the
period
of
course
it
negotiated
numerous
collective
bargaining
contracts.
in
november
of
1947,
the
parties
were
in
negotiations
for
a
successor
agreement,
an
impasse
developed.
the
union
elected
to
go
on
strike,
and
struck
one
of
the
employers
involved
here.
it
was
a
long
and
bitter
strike
which
lasted
for
approximately
13
months.
during
the
period
of
the
strike,
considerable
litigations
ensued.
in
december
of
1958,
the
toledo
mediation
committee,
headed
by
monsignor
ryan,
intervened,
and
through
his
good
offices,
succeeded
in
bringing
the
strike
to
an
end.
however,
as
a
condition
of
bringing
the
strike
to
a
termination,
the
union
was
requested
--
the
union
withdrew
its
claim
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
even
though
there
were
hundreds
of
employees
on
strike,
and
stated
it
would
not
renew
its
request
for
--
as
the
bargaining
agent
unless
and
until
it
was
certified.
it
agreed
to
cease
all
picketing
activities,
dismiss
all
litigation,
execute
mutual
releases,
releasing
all
parties
from
any
and
all
liabilities
arising
out
of
strike.
the
employers,
on
their
part,
agreed
to
reinstate
all
of
the
strikers
without
discrimination
to
their
former
stations
and
stores,
agreed
that
they
would
not
discriminate
against
them
and
that
they
would
not
be
discharged
except
for
just
cause.
also
agrees
that
notwithstanding
the
union's
disclaimer
that
it
would
not
request
bargaining
--
exclusive
bargaining
rights
that
the
union
would
or
it's
representatives
would
be
permitted
to
access
to
the
stores
within
reasonable
hours
for
the
purpose
of
communicating
with
employees.
it
was
also
appended
to
this
strike
settlement
agreement,
the
complete
panoply
of
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
actually
representing
the
terms
of
the
expired
contract
which
the
union
sought
to
approve,
but
was
unable
to
obtain
its
objective
in
addition
to
certain
adjustments
which
the
employer
had
unilaterally
made
during
the
course
of
the
strike.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
i
do
not
believe
that
it
has
any
statutory
basis.
it
is
a
private
organization
which
publi
--
which
serves
in
the
public
interest.
it
is
a
very
well-known
agency
and
i
believe
it's
called
the
toledo
labor
management
committee.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
no,
sir.
it
is
a
continuing
body
and
has
existed
for
many
years
and
a
great
deal
has
been
written
about
the
operations
of
this
committee.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
it
has
a
very
long
history.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes,
sir,
a
very
long
history.
however,
within
two
or
three
months
following
the
--
i
might
also
point
out
one
very
important
point.
the
strike
settlement
agreement
provided
that
any
disagreement
respecting
the
interpretation
or
application
of
the
agreement
would
be
subject
to
grievances
and
would
also
be
subject
to
final
and
binding
arbitration
by
the
labor
management
committee.
within
several
months,
several
matters
were
submitted
to
the
labor
management
committee.
some
of
them
were
returned
to
the
parties
for
negotiations,
others
were
decided
in
favor
of
the
employer,
but
two
particular
grievances
were
decided
in
favor
of
the
union.
one,
that
two
particular
striking
employees
should
be
reinstated
to
their
precise
former
stations
in
the
store
and
that
two,
the
union
which
had
been
denied
access
to
the
employee
cafeteria,
for
the
purpose
of
communicating
with
the
employees,
should
be
granted
that
--
that
prerogative
because
that
was
one
of
the
provisions
in
the
agreement.
the
employers
refused
to
comply,
petitioned
the
labor
management
committee
for
reconsideration.
the
committee,
reaffirmed
that's
holding,
pointing
out
that
its
decisions
were
final
and
binding
and
that
they
were
correct,
nevertheless,
the
employer
still
refused
to
comply.
the
union
to
that
point
has
the
alternative
or
perhaps
resorting
to
economics
--
to
economic
action,
continuing
the
strikes
and
the
activities
involved
for
filing
action
for
specific
performance
of
the
arbitration
of
warrants.
the
union
had
already
been
on
strike
for
a
long
period
so
a
great
deal
suffering
is
involved.
the
union
decided
to
file
an
action
under
section
301
for
a
specific
performance
of
the
arbitration
of
warrants.
the
record
is
here
on
stipulation
which
consist
of
the
pleadings
plus
a
stipulation
of
facts.
so,
we
have
a
rather
short
record
here.
the
lower
court,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
and
the
lower
court
opinion
is
really
the
one
which
must
be
reviewed
because
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
a
virtual
endorsement
of
the
reasoning
of
the
lower
court
and
doesn't
set
forth
any
other
rationale,
they
indicated
that
the
lower
court
held
that
this
was
not
a
--
that
301
is
limited
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
a
strike
settlement
agreement,
without
examining
or
explaining
the
terms
and
conditions,
they
said
--
the
lower
court
said,
it's
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
as
to
why
it
was
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
not
made
clear
because
surely
it
was
executed
and
negotiated
on
behalf
of
numerous
employees.
and
then
it
further
discussed
the
proposition
and
made
a
specific
finding
of
fact
that
the
union
have
disclaimed
its
right
to
be
the
bargaining
--
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
and
this
was
also
a
condition
to
the
exercise
of
lower
court
to
jurisdiction
under
section
301.
studying
the
opinion,
it's
apparent
to
me
that
if
there
is
any
rationale
to
the
lower
court's
opinion,
it
is
found
in
the
effort
to
say
because
section
301
provides
that
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization,
representing
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce,
that
the
phrase
representing
employees
presupposes
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
from
there,
they
have
attempted
to
move
a
step
further
and
therefore,
when
you're
talking
about
representing
employees,
you're
talking
about
an
--
a
representative
which
is
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
because
we're
talking
about
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
its
amendments.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
well,
of
course,
it
is
a
very
astonishing
holding
when
all
we
have
--
when
a
union
after
13
months
of
strike
has
the
soul
fruit
of
the
strike
as
disagreement
and
its
enforcement
and
then
for
a
court
to
say
that
it
is
taking
up
too
much
of
the
court's
time
to
seek
to
enforce
an
agreement
obtaining
the
reinstatement
of
employees
to
their
former
stations,
giving
the
union
access
to
the
store
which
is
the
only
effective
means
through
which
we
could
continue
to
make
a
communication,
well,
i
--
frankly,
i'm
in
rather
astonishment
because
in
effect,
he
was
not
only
saying
that
in
his
judgment,
these
grievances
were
not
important.
perhaps,
they
were
not
to
him
but
i
can
assure
in
this
honorable
bench,
they
were
of
great
importance
to
the
union
because
as
a
result
of
their
position,
the
agreement
was
unenforceable
and
was
a
scrap
of
paper.
and
the
dispute
and
the
disruptions
continued
and
that,
of
course,
may
have
influenced
his
judgment
but
if
so
it
is
very
unfortunate
because
he
laid
down
at
--
on
a
basis
of
that
a
--
a
doctrine
of
far
reaching
importance.
i
was,
to
continue
my
discussion,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
pointed
out
the
--
what
appears
to
be
the
rationale
of
the
court.
i
think
it
is
plain
that
the
court
in
that
rationale
was
in
serious
error
because
the
phrase
which
he
relies
upon
is
in
no
way
a
limitation
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
but
is
the
basis
under
which
congress
regulates
labor
relations.
it
is
the
interstate
aspect
under
which
congress
could
take
hold
of
the
dispute,
under
which
congress
could
enact
301.
it
of
course
says
representing
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce
as
defined
in
this
chapter
and
so,
it
obviously
was
no
way
any
jurisdiction
of
limitation.
if
i
might,
perhaps,
speak
a
little
harsh,
i
might
say
if
one
were
to
take
that
very
same
interpretation
and
go
to
section
301
(b)
which
is
the
following
section
which
sets
of
the
procedural
aspects
--
some
--
in
some
procedural
aspects
under
301,
there
it
provides
that
a
labor
union
shall
be
responsible
for
the
acts
of
their
agents
and
it
uses
the
same
precise
language,
representing
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce.
if
the
court
were
to
--
if
the
court's
interpretation
would've
--
were
to
prevail,
that
would
mean
that
labor
unions
would
not
be
responsible
for
the
acts
of
their
agents
except
in
a
situation
involving
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
where
the
union
is
acknowledged
and
certified
bargaining
representative.
that,
of
course,
would
be
a
plainly
and
absurd
result
because
congress
has
set
up
in
section
303,
actions
for
damages
where
unions
are
--
have
engaged
in
secondary
boycotts,
where
unions
have
engaged
in
other
kinds
of
labor
union
activities
which
are
made
to
basis
of
damaged
actions.
but
the
court,
in
no
way,
saw
--
came
to
grips
with
this
particular
problem
i
might
point
out.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
he
did
not
in
anyway
rationalized
that
because
it
is
plain
that
that
was
not
in
issue.
in
that
respect,
it
is
plain
that
the
agreements
under
which
arbitration
occurs,
the
statements
of
understanding
occurred
between
the
employers
and
the
union
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
true
because
the
--
because
the
plaintiffs,
the
unions
were
there
negotiating
this
agreement
on
behalf
of
their
employees.
the
union
obtained
the
right
to
send
representatives
into
the
store
for
the
purpose
of
communicating
with
employees
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes.
that's
one
of
various
grievances.
in
addition
to
that
is
that
it's
quite
clear
that
when
--
that
the
union
has
a
vital
concern
with
the
enforceability
of
the
contract
as
a
whole,
the
sole
fruit
of
the
strike.
it's
also
clear
that
the
union
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
it
did
not
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
it
did
not
quite
say
to
represent
employees
if
they
will
not
seek
to
be
recognized
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
but
the
right
to
represent
employees
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
--
is
a
basic
right
as
mr.
--
as
just
--
as
judge
hand
pointed
out
in
the
dowd
versus
retail
clerks
case.
even
in
face
of
a
certified
bargaining
union,
a
rival
union
may
still
be
chosen
by
certain
employees
to
represent
it
in
the
handling
of
grievances
and
in
the
situation
which
is
in
no
way
inconsistent
with
the
certified
bargaining
status
of
the
rival
union
and
surely
in
the
situation
of
that
type
of
the
kind
considered
by
judge
hand
in
dowd
versus
retail
stores
were
fruit
in
our
brief.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
which
--
which
in
anyway
contradicts
the
basic
agreement,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
oh
surely
--
oh
surely,
i
mean
if
plaintiffs
have
as
much,
they
were
--
it
was
much
for
the
benefit
of
plaintiff
as
any
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
any
kind
of
arrangement
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
precisely.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
precisely
sir.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
precisely
sir.
yes
sir,
quite
precisely.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes
sir.
let
me
tell
you
about
that
sir.
as
this
court
has
pointed
in
lincoln
mills,
both
the
majority
of
the
dissenting
opinion
agreed
on
this
point
that
the
legislative
history
of
301
is
--
is
cloudy
and
confusing,
but
there's
one
aspect
which
is
quite
clear.
the
senate
bill
which
sought
to
enact
a
provision
similar
to
301
did
have
reference
to
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
in
terms
and
such
language,
but
without
the
finding
just
what
is
meant
by
collective
bargaining?
the
house
bill
has
no
such
reference.
in
conference,
it
was
agreed
to
delete
the
reference
to
collective
bargaining
and
present
301
as
it's
now
written
is
the
house
version
of
301,
making
absolutely
no
reference
to
any
collective
bargaining
or
exclusive
bargaining
status.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
correct
sir.
the
phrase,
i
think,
originated
with
the
(inaudible)
was
grabbed
in
their
monumental
study,
i
think
they
used
that
term
for
the
first
time
and
it
deferred
generally
even
--
it
referred
generally
to
agreements
between
unions
without
regard
to
whether
they
have
exclusive
bargaining
status.
the
court,
of
course,
is
cognizant
particularly
justice
douglas
because
he
reviewed
the
situation
in
one
of
his
opinions
that
prior
to
the
wagner
act,
it
was
quite
common
for
unions
to
enter
into
contracts
only
on
behalf
of
their
members,
only
in
behalf
of
certain
groups
would
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
and
those
were
the
steel
industry
agreements
that
was
with
the
original
automobile
industry
agreements
and
that
congress
was
quite
cognizant
of
that
situation.
and
it
was
precisely
the
kind
of
situation
which
this
court
reviewed
in
the
consolidated
edison
case
where
it
recognized
that
public
policy
would
be
--
would
be
enhanced
by
the
enforcing
of
an
agreement
with
the
members
only
contract
there.
and
of
course,
this
is
one
of
the
difficulties
with
the
lower
court's
opinion
because
by
the
lower
court's
standards,
you
could
not
enforce
--
you
could
not
enforce
such
agreements.
by
the
lower
court's
standards,
you
could
not
enforce
for
example
an
agreement
which
is
entered
into
under
section
8
(f)
of
the
amendment
to
the
taft-hartley
law.
under
8
(f),
as
the
court
may
well
know,
building
trade
unions
have
the
privilege
of
entering
into
contracts
with
contractors
prior
to
the
hiring
of
any
employee
even
though
they
have
--
even
though
the
majority
status
has
in
no
respect
been
established.
by
the
court's
standards,
of
course,
there
could
be
no
such
enforcement
so
that
lower
courts
would
have
no
jurisdiction
to
in
any
respect
to
consider
these
matters.
a
consent
agreement
for
an
election
in
which
a
union
perhaps
is
picketing
and
claiming
it's
entitle
to
be
recognized,
the
employer
says
are
okay,
i'll
enter
into
agreement
with
you
for
an
election
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
are
entitled
to
represent
the
employees.
the
union
has
no
status.
surely,
that
is
within
the
public
policy
to
resolve
a
question
of
that
sort.
if
the
employer
reneged
on
his
agreement
under
those
circumstances,
this
lower
court
will
hold
that
it
could
not
enforce
such
agreements.
or
if
the
union
was
to
be
--
to
engage
in
organizing
activities
and
there
should
be
something
to
discharge
and
the
union
threat
this
court
a
strike
and
the
employer
says,
“i
think
this
was
a
just
discharge
and
the
union
says
okay”
submit
it
to
arbitration
and
the
answer
to
a
stipulation
to
be
submitted
to
arbitration,
the
employer
reneges.
shouldn't
that
be
the
kind
of
an
agreement
which
is
enforceable?
but
actually,
our
precise
--
the
precise
facts
of
our
case
is
really
much
narrower
because
what
we
have
here
is
not
really
the
enforcement
of
the
agreement
as
a
whole.
what
we
have
here
precisely
is
merely
the
enforcement
of
certain
arbitration
awards
rendered
in
favor
of
the
unions
and
the
employees
involved.
arbitration
awards
in
which
the
employer
participated
in
the
proceedings
and
as
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
i
believe,
it
was
in
the
steelworkers
case,
this
in
itself,
although
the
arguments
aside
is
a
contract
to
accept
and
provide
by
the
arbitration
award.
and
this,
of
course,
is
the
narrower
question
but
the
court
below
in
no
respect
considered
this
issue
or
to
the
--
or
to
the
court
in
any
respect
below,
considered
the
extent
to
which
the
strike
settlement
agreement
in
fact
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
the
general
term
that
they
used,
collective
bargaining
is
not
a
phrase
of
art,
it
covers
a
broad
situation.
it
seems
to
me,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
situation
is
precisely
similar
to
the
one
which
the
court
faced
in
the
ryan
case.
in
the
ryan
case,
as
the
court
well
knows,
a
criminal
proceeding
was
involved
in
the
section
302.
ryan
was
accused
of,
and
found
guilty,
i
believe,
of
misconduct
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
his
office.
and
it
was
argued
that
302
have
no
application
to
ryan
because
it
only
had
application
to
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
that
the
word
--
the
word
“representative”
meant
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
decision
the
extent
to
which
the
entire
policy
of
the
law
would
be
frustrated
if
such
an
interpretational
granted
and
this
is
not
the
policy
of
the
act.
so,
it
seems
to
me
in
this
respect,
the
situation
is
quite
similar
to
ryan.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
vice
of
the
lower
court's
decision
is
found
in
its
attempting
to
relate
section
301
to
the
unfair
labor
practices
proceed
--
sections
and
the
representation
sections
of
the
labor
act.
obviously,
when
congress
spoke
about
301,
it
was
not
talking
about
unfair
labor
practices.
it
was
talking
about
enforcement
of
contracts.
indeed,
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
that
an
effort
was
made
to
hold
a
violation
of
a
contract
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
this
was
rejected.
it
is,
of
course,
clear
that
the
labor
board
has
no
jurisdiction
nor
does
it
attempt
in
anyway
to
deal
with
the
enforcement
of
contracts.
this
has
left
in
the
spirit
of
lincoln
mills
to
the
federal
courts
for
the
fashioning
of
a
body
of
common
law
to
be
taken
from
our
national
labor
policy
and
it
is
in
no
way
related
to
301.
congress
knew
very
well
how
the
state
concepts
of
majority
representation
where
that
was
to
be
a
prerequisite
if
congress
desired
to
do
so
because
in
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
labor
act
dealing
with
making
of
union
shops,
it
is
specifically
provided
that
the
union
must
be
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
before
it
can
enter
into
a
union
shop
agreement.
in
section
8
(a)
(5),
dealing
with
the
problems
of
collective
bargaining
before
you
can
compel
an
employer
to
bargain
with
you,
it
is
you
being
the
union,
the
union
must
be
the
majority
representative
but
those
are
other
concepts
entirely.
those
are
not
the
concepts
of
section
301
and
i
submit
that
the
court
erred,
it
doesn't
spell
it
out,
but
the
only
way
i
can
rationalize
it
is
that
the
court
was
relating
301
to
unfair
labor
practices
and
yet
there
was
a
completely
different
policy
involved.
i
suppose
the
situation
could
be
dramatized
if
this
were
to
rise
in
the
steel
industry
or
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
thank
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
point
out
another
basic
problem
raised
by
the
lower
court's
opinion.
the
court
will
observe
that
301
is
not
limited
to
suits
between
employers
and
labor
unions,
but
also
provides
for
the
enforcement
of
contracts
between
labor
unions
themselves.
the
court
of
course
disregarded
that
feature
and
in
no
ways
seemed
to
be
troubled
by
that
aspect,
but
to
me,
it
is
a
clear
expression
that
congress
intended
to
cover
the
entire
field
of
labor
contracts
which
in
anyway
contribute
to
stability
in
labor
affairs
and
indicated
a
broad
concept
must
be
given
to
the
term
labor
contracts,
and
it
was
not
to
be
a
limited
application
and
that
it
seems
to
me
was
quite
indicative
by
the
fact
that
congress
covered
contracts
between
labor
unions.
another
difficulty
with
the
lower
court's
opinion,
if
i
haven't
said
enough,
is
that
the
lower
court
would
provide
that
every
suit
for
the
enforcement
of
a
contract
would
inevitably
raise
a
representation
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
union
suing
or
being
sued
was
in
fact
the
bargaining
agent
and
this
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
well,
assuming
that
you
have
the
recognition
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
well,
if
the
--
if
in
fact
it
is
a
jurisdictional
concept
as
the
lower
court
holds,
that
you
must
be
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent,
then
jurisdiction
cannot
be
granted
surely
by
words,
saying
you
are
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
at
least
this
is
one
of
the
problems
which
has
raised
because
you
--
mind
you,
we're
talking
about
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
--
yes.
i
have
difficulty
with
that
too
and
--
but
this
is
the
problem
which
was
raised
and
every
enforcement
proceeding
could
very
well
become
converted
into
a
representation
proceeding
to
term
with
in
fact,
and
of
course
this
would
definitely
be
in
derogation
of
the
labor
board's
processes
to
exclusively
determine
representation
questions.
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
was
not
concerned
with
any
of
these
problems,
but
congress
was
concerned
with
the
idea
of
placing
sanctions
and
behind
agreements
which
carrying
out
any
national
labor
policy
and
this
is
the
way
to
settle
disputes
and
if
the
federal
court
should
be
open
to
enforce
these
agreements
and
it
was
--
and
it
is
a
broad
statute
in
that
respect.
the
lower
court
in
no
respect
paid
heed
to
what
i
believed
to
be
national
policy,
which
i
believe
is
important
in
determining
the
scope
of
301
questions
of
jurisdiction.
it
made
no
reference
to
lincoln
mills
or
steelworkers
cases.
it
made
no
reference
to
the
preamble
of
the
act.
it
made
no
reference
to
the
norris-laguardia
provisions
and
the
policies
involved
there,
encouraging
the
peaceful
adjustment
of
disputes.
it
made
no
record
--
it
made
no
reference
to
title
ii
of
the
labor
act
which
sets
up
this
entire
complicated
mediation
and
conciliation
machinery,
all
devised
to
bring
parties
together
to
end
labor
disputes.
indeed,
it
did
not
consider
the
concept
of
labor
disputes.
it
was
a
very
narrow
--
very
narrow
approach.
i
would
like
--
for
the
next
few
minutes
to
meet
and
anticipate
some
of
the
arguments
which
i
believe
my
opponent
will
raise
to
this
court.
when
i,
as
he
stated
this
brief,
he
takes
the
position
that
the
stipulation
which
the
parties
entered
into
had
a
provision
in
it
in
which
the
parties
agreed
that
there
was
no
collective
bargaining
on
an
individual
store
basis
and
this
demonstrates
that
in
fact
there
was
no
collective
bargaining.
of
course,
it
is
conveniently
overlooked
that
the
last
part
of
the
stipulation
provides
that
nothing
herein
shall
exclude
the
courts
from
finding
that
the
strike
settlement
agreement
was
in
fact
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
to
why
the
--
as
to
why
there
was
any
provision,
respecting
individual
collective
bargaining,
i
think
is
a
matter
of
speculation.
the
explanation
perhaps
is
this.
in
fact
there
was
no
individual
bargaining,
they
bargained
on
a
multiple
employer
basis.
the
strike
settlement
was
not
negotiated
with
any
particular
individual
employer,
but
was
negotiated
with
several
employers.
but
in
any
event,
i
believe
it
is
quite
clear
that
what
we
have
before
us
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
i
think
that
the
stipulation
itself,
the
very
last
paragraph
there,
clearly
indicates
that
nothing
in
the
stipulation
was
to
preclude
the
courts
from
finding
that
this
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
that
respect,
i
refer
to
page
41
of
the
transcript
where
it
is
specifically
set
forth
saying,
“nothing
in
this
paragraph
is
to
preclude
the
courts
from
finding
that
the
settlement
of
december
24th,
1958
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.”
again,
i
think
this
whole
concept
of
what
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
specifically
defined
and
i
don't
think
it
has
any
particular
real
meaning
in
terms
of
the
problem
before
us.
the
other
question
which
i
would
like
to
discuss
because
i
think
it
was
raised
in
the
respondent's
brief
is
the
bernhard-altmann
problem.
respondent
believes
that
what
we
are
seeking
here
is
exclusive
bargaining
rights
because
there
was
appended
to
the
strike
settlement
agreement,
the
terms
and
conditions
which
were
operative
in
the
store
and
the
court
in
bernhard-altmann
struck
down
an
exclusive
bargaining
contract
where
in
fact
the
union
did
not
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees.
i
believe
that
bernhard-altmann
is
in
no
respect
applicable.
one,
i
refer
back
to
my
previous
argument
of
the
basic
distinction
between
enforcement
of
contracts
under
301
and
unfair
labor
practices
which
is
another
proposition
when
the
court
enforces
contracts.
it
is
not
adjudicating
in
any
respect,
in
any
matter
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
but
enforcing
a
provision
of
a
contract.
of
course
in
the
enforcement
of
the
contract,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
lincoln
mills,
once
the
court
assumes
jurisdiction
or
search
jurisdiction,
it
questionably
will
take
in
to
consideration
all
aspects
of
federal
law.
but
bernhard-altmann,
if
it
were
to
arise
at
all,
would
arise
only
after
the
court
has
taken
jurisdiction
in
a
situation
perhaps
where
we
were
seeking
to
enforce
the
contract
as
a
whole
as
an
exclusive
bargaining
agent,
and
not
in
any
situation
where
we
are
seeking
as
matter
of
--
as
matter
of
an
arbitration
award
to
reinstatement
of
two
strikers,
and
the
right
of
the
union
representatives
to
obtain
access
for
the
store.
i
believe
the
bernhard-altmann
decision
makes
it
clear
that
device
in
that
case
was
exclusive
bargaining
feature
and
but
for
that,
the
contract
of
course
would
have
been
a
members
only
contract
or
would
have
been
limited
and
would
not
create
any
difficulty.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes
sir,
i'll
be
happy
to.
respondent
has
suggested
this
cause
is
in
the
moot.
it
is
true,
that
following
the
institution
of
the
lawsuit,
three
local
unions
who
are
members
of
a
council,
merged
with
the
council
into
a
single
local
union.
they
merged
and
took
the
name
of
local
924
i
believe
is
the
name
of
the
new
local
union.
in
fact,
the
local
unions
maintain
their
distinct
identity
as
divisions
within
local
924.
they
hold
separate
meetings,
they
have
separate
officers,
they
maintain
the
same
employees,
all
rights
and
obligations
have
been
assumed
and
are
carried
out,
and
all
obligations
are
met.
what
was
involved
was
purely
an
internal
maneuver,
an
internal
operation
within
the
unions
where
instead
of
having
three
local
unions
affiliated
with
the
council,
the
council
was
abolished
and
the
three
local
unions
became
one,
but
they
maintain
their
complete
identity.
the
membership
is
there.
they're
operating
as
separate
divisions
and
in
all
respects,
they
are
in
a
position
to
carry
on,
and
are
carrying
on
all
collective
bargaining
relationships.
it
is
pure
--
it
was
purely
an
internal
operation,
and
in
no
respect
having
any
kind
of
an
impact
so
far
as
outside
relations
were
concerned.
we
point
out
in
brief
that
this
court
had
met
the
same
problem
in
number
of
--
in
a
number
of
instances
and
has
overruled
any
suggestion
of
mootness.
at
best,
you
have
a
successorship
where
the
successor
assumed
in
all
respects
all
the
rights
and
obligations.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes
sir,
there
is.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
well,
the
record
itself
isn't
there,
but
there
is
in
the
--
but
there
is
in
our
--
in
the
--
in
our
statement
of
facts
that
the
suggestion
of
mootness
was
not
litigated
anyway.
it's
on
page
2,
if
the
court
please,
of
our
motion
to
add
or
substitute
where
we
say
--
page
2,
paragraph
6
in
connection
with
discussion,
we
say
all
contract,
rights
and
obligations
of
present
petitions
have
been
assumed
and
prosecuted
in
the
name
of
local
924
without
interruption.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
well
the
basis
--
the
basis
of
course
is
the
affidavit
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
--
it's
the
affidavit
of
counsel
on
the
matter
and
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
the
question
arose.
the
question
was
raised
for
the
first
time
by
respondent
in
his
brief
as
a
statement
in
which
he
suggested
mootness
and
the
only
way
we
could
respond
to
the
thing
was
by
counsel's
own
investigation
of
the
facts
and
determination
as
to
the
facts
and
my
word
of
course
as
counsel
had
investigating
facts,
and
there
is
nothing
to
contradict
it.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
these
are
--
yes
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
no
sir.
no
sir,
but
it
was
made
for
the
first
time
here
in
united
states
supreme
court,
in
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes
sir,
it
does.
well,
i
think
we
do
cite
that
case.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes,
you
did
in
the
footnote
sir.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
--
yes
sir
you
did.
you
reached
it
on
two
separate
occasions
i
believe
and
you
also
reached
it
in
a
prior
order
in
the
steelworker
case.
you
first
issued
an
order
and
then
again
the
court
reached
it
in
this
decision
where
are
discussed
it
in
a
footnote,
but
you're
correct
justice
brennan.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes
you
do.
you
are
completely
correct
and
i
believe
so
far
as
bernhard-altmann
is
concerned,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
cameron
iron
case
where
then
fifth
circuit
where
certiorari
is
denied,
where
the
court
pointed
out
distinctions
between
unfair
labor
practices
and
the
enforcement
of
contracts,
that
one
does
not
impinge
on
the
other.
if
there
is,
we
have
any
unfair
labor
practices,
the
labor
board
still
sits
--
still
sits.
there
is
nothing
in
a
301
proceeding
which
in
any
respect
(inaudible)
or
divest
the
labor
board
jurisdiction.
for
long
time,
the
labor
board
has
dealt
it
within
his
own
policy
to
permit
arbitrations,
and
whether
or
not,
the
labor
board
will
take
jurisdiction
where
there's
an
arbitration
award
is
a
matter
of
its
own
discretion.
it
makes
up
his
mind
whether
or
not
this
arbitration
award
carries
out
its
policies,
or
whether
or
not
he
believes
it
took
--
it
should
take
a
jurisdiction,
but
the
point
i
make
is,
that
in
the
301
action
unfair
labor
practices
are
not
involved
but
other
considerations.
i
might
point
out
that
in
any
event
of
course,
it's
more
than
6
months
of
taking
place
and
so,
there
could
not
be
any
unfair
labor
practices
brought
here.
i
would
like
to
close
my
main
statement
with
the
respondent's
brief.
respondent
in
his
main
brief
seeks
(inaudible)
to
support
the
court's
holding,
that
exclusive
bargaining
recognition
is
a
condition
precedent
to
the
court's
jurisdiction.
indeed,
he
poses
the
question
in
that
light,
but
when
confronted
with
the
members-only
argument,
but
the
members
only
argument
if
--
if
--
if
--
if
members-only
contracts
had
been
forced,
cannot
be
squared
in
the
court's
opinion.
he
then
retreats
and
accuses
--
and
accuses
us
of
misreading
the
court's
opinion
and
thereby
concedes
that
members-only
contracts
are
enforceable
if
they
can
be
found
to
the
collective
bargaining
contracts.
i
point
this
out
because
it
--
to
me,
it
appears
to
be
abandonment
by
counsel
of
the
court's
basic
rationale
because
aside
from
the
rationale,
that
301
must
be
related
to
other
sections
of
the
law
requiring
exclusive
bargaining
right
for
other
purposes,
the
holding
that
this
is
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
makes
no
sense
at
all
because
there's
no
examination
of
that
proposition
because
plainly
any
agreement
between
a
labor
union
and
an
employer
execute
on
behalf
of
one
or
more
--
of
several
employees
is
within
in
a
broad
sense,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
a
--
a
terminal
part,
there
is
nothing
to
find.
and
so,
if
the
court's
opinion,
lower
court's
opinion
is
be
given
any
rationale
at
all,
even
though
i
think
a
highly
disputable
one,
it
must
rest
on
the
proposition
as
i
think
it
spelled
out
and
as
it
pointed
out
in
its
findings
of
fact
that
union
involved
was
not
the
exclusive
bargaining
agency.
i
therefore
conclude
by
pointing
out
that
i
believe
that
the
courts
--
the
lower
court
erred
very
seriously
because
i
think
if
allowed
to
stand,
it
will
create
a
very
serious
frustration
and
impediment
to
the
carrying
out
of
the
promise
of
lincoln
mills
and
the
steelworkers
cases.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes
sir,
thank
you
sir.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
i
think
the
record
shows
that
on
--
it's
breaches
by
contracts.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
i
would
first
like
to
address
myself
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
and
i
think
with
his
usual
perception
he's
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
i
say
with
your
usual
perception,
you
pointed
out
disturbing
elements
in
the
court's
opinion
which
indicates
a
lack
of
consistency,
really.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes.
the
court
also
--
i
think
the
essence
of
the
court's
opinion
is
found
in
this
paragraph.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
this
is
found
on
page
47,
the
second
paragraph
in
the
bottom.
we
believe
that
the
act
enlarging
the
authority
in
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
contemplates
such
authority
to
be
exercised
where
there's
been
a
violation
of
a
contract
that
had
been
entered
into
between
employer
and
a
labor
organization
representing
employees
and
(inaudible)
effect
in
congress
and
it
thereby
contemplates
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
agreement
that
we
are
here
considering
is
a
strike
settling
of
the
agreement
which
we
could
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
and
then
the
court
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
that's
right
sir.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
that's
right.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
that's
right
sir.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes.
and
you'll
find
throughout
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
recognition,
at
the
same
time
sir,
there
are
the
matters
you
pointed
out
which
just
don't
make
a
consistent
picture.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes.
let
me
then
refer
you
to
another
section
of
lower
court's
opinion
sir.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
i
appreciate
that
sir.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
i
think
that
the
lower
court
and
the
upper
court
both
recognized
that
they
have
contracts.
again,
i
refer
you
to
page
46
of
the
lower
court's
opinion
where
the
lower
court
says
and
the
study
of
the
legislative
background
of
the
act,
and
certain
decisions
with
that,
we
have
examined,
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
strike
settlement,
that
was
concluded
on
december
24,
1958
is
not
such
a
contract,
so
he
first
--
the
strike
settlement
as
a
contract.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
i
appreciate,
it
was
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
i
recognize
there
is
that
loose
language
but
i
think
being
read
as
a
whole,
i
think
he's
referring
to
collective
bargaining
agreements,
that
great
deal
of
colloquy
occurred
between
counsel
and
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
we
have
a
contract.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
court,
and
i
think
mr.
justice
black
didn't
make
reference
to
it
but
i
would
fill
up
my
duty
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
it,
on
page
8
which
is
a
letter
of
transmittal
in
which
the
strikes
settlement
itself
was
appended
and
the
employer
says,
the
conditions
to
be
formed
and
met
by
us
are
of
course
subject
to
and
conditioned
upon
the
receipt
by
your
organization
of
guarantees
from
the
respective
labor
organizations
to
make
the
principles
enumerate
err
completely
effective.
now,
i
refer
the
court
to
page
30,
in
which
the
union
in
writing
accepts
it,
and
this
is
the
letter
to
monsignor
doyle
and
it
also
partly
answers
justice
frankfurter's
question
as
to
what
kind
of
mediation
we
have.
we
had
a
mediator
who
moved
between
hotels,
transmitting
and
carrying
messages
and
seeking
to
reach
an
agreement.
we
say
there
in
the
--
we
acknowledge
of
the
transmittal
from
the
employer
to
him
and
the
stipulations.
then
we
say
we
here
with
agree
to
--
to
the
conditions
and
guarantees
of
the
statement
of
understanding,
attached
exhibits
of
subject
to
proof
reading
to
assure
conformity
with
applicable
provisions
of
the
expired
contract
in
november
15,
1957
offer
through
the
l-m-c.
actually,
the
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
appended
where
the
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
of
the
expired
contract
plus
additional
officer
--
plus
additional
offers
which
have
been
made
through
the
l-m-c
and
so
we
accepted
all
these
things
subject
to
it
proofreading.
then
we
say
we
agree
that
the
success
of
the
undertaking
and
stability
of
labor
relations
depend
upon
the
good
faith
of
the
parties,
such
assurance
is
a
grant
on
our
behalf.
i
might
point
out,
get
down
to
the
very
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
the
company
said
the
same
thing
and
i
might
point
out
that
this
agreement
was
reached
on
christmas
eve.
monsignor
ryan.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
doyle
sir,
excuse
me
sir,
doyle.
i
further
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
he
said
--
he
said
that
this
was
a
great
christmas
present
to
the
people
of
toledo,
but
of
course
it
didn't
turn
out
to
be
such.
i
might
end
by
pointing
out
that
all
we
have
here
involved
in
the
last
analysis
is
whether
or
not
an
arbitrator's
award
participated
in
by
the
parties
can
be
enforced
that
--
where
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
enforce
that
arbitrator's
award
under
section
301.
this
arbitrator's
award
has
made
pursuant
to
the
strike
settlement's
agreement.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
well,
i
would
say
in
the
--
i
would
say
the
court,
it
was
called
upon
to
apply
substance
of
law
as
to
whether
--
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
no.
to
my
knowledge
those
matters
were
not
determined.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
they
were
there
--
they
were
not
determined.
he
just
wouldn't
let
us
in
the
door.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
to
my
knowledge
it
was
not
raised.
it
may
have
been
raised
before
the
arbitrator,
but
that
record
is
not
before
us,
all
that
was
raised
was
the
sole
question
of
jurisdiction.
we
were
not
allowed
to
enter
the
door
and
to
present
our
case
to
the
court
and
that
of
course
is
our
grievance.
and
we
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
give
us
an
opportunity
to
seek
enforcement
of
the
strike
settlement
agreement
particularly
the
arbitrator's
award
reinstating
these
two
employees
to
the
former
stations
and
giving
the
union
the
opportunity
to
communicate
with
employees
in
the
employee
cafeteria.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
no
sir,
i
was
not.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
although
i
did
participate
in
the
strike
settlement
agreement.
mr.
s.g.
lippman
yes
sir.
thank
you
sir,
thank
you.
