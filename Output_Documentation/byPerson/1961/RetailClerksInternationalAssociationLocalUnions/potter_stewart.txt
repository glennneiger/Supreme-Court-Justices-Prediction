it
has
a
long
history
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
dating
back
to
the
1930s
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
judge
kloeb
had
in
mind
when
he
said
at
page
46,
whether
there
is
justification
for
taking
the
time
of
a
court
because
of
these
differences
between
the
parties
has
opened
the
grave
question.
isn't
that
sought
influence
to
the
decision
in
this
case?
and
then
he
refers
to
the
causes
of
action
as
tenuous
indeed
based
on
grievances
that
are
not
waiting,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i'm
still
a
little
troubled
by
the
court's
reasoning
--
the
rationale
of
the
court's
decision
and
it
strikes
me
and
i'm
now
referring
to
page
47
of
the
record
right
at
the
end
of
the
last
full
paragraph
on
that
page
that
what
the
court
may
have
been
saying
is
that
this
contract
wasn't
--
it
says,
it
wasn't
entered
into
for
the
benefit
of
--
of
these
plaintiffs
and
that
therefore,
there
might
be
some
question
of
standing
of
whether
these
were
proper
parties?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
part
of
the
--
part
of
the
agreement,
part
of
the
deal
was
that
these
plaintiffs,
that
is
the
labor
union
locals,
should
get
out
of
the
picture
until
or
unless
they
were
certified,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
one
of
the
grievances
here,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
they
agree
that
they
would
no
longer
purport
or
seek
to
represent
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
until
they
were
certified
by
the
nlrb?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
agreed
with
that,
to
agree
with
your
version
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
district
court
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
they
--
they
--
they
recognized
or
they
said
that
they
understood
that
there
was
a
contract
involved
here,
i'm
now
looking
at
page
52.
they
said
on
their
brief
per
curium
that
the
contract
here
involved
is
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
did
imply
there
was
a
contract
then
they
went
on
to
say
that
the
district
court,
their
view
was
correct
and
thinking
that
only
collecting
bargaining
agreements
were
subject
to
301.
