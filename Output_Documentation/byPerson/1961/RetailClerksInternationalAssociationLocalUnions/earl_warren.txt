me
ask
you
this
question
on
page

of
the
transcript
--
in
page

we
have
the
stipulation
that
you
yourself
entered
into
in
this
--
in
this
case
in
which
you
say
in
the
last
paragraph
on
page
40
that
it's
further
stipulated
that
--
that
the
wages,
hours,
and
other
term
and
conditions
of
employment
were
not
bargained
for
but
they
were
--
they
were
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
agreement,
and
that
there
is
nothing
new
in
it
except
item

which
has
to
do
with
--
with
insurance
and
--
and
other
welfare
provisions
for

but
at
the
end
of
that
paragraph,
you
say
nothing
in
this
paragraph
is
to
preclude
the
court
from
finding
that
the
settlement
of
december
24,
1958
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
that's
the
--
that's
the
contract
that
we're
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
stipulating
yourself
out
of
court
and
when
you
say
that
nothing
in
this
paragraph
is
to
preclude
the
court
from
finding
that
it
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
if
you
agree
to
that
way,
you've
--
you've
lost
your
lawsuit,
haven't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
you're
saying
that
nothing
in
this
paragraph
is
to
preclude
the
court
from
following
the
law,
is
that
what
you
say
you
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
only
all
you
meant.
chief

because

was
a
contract.
