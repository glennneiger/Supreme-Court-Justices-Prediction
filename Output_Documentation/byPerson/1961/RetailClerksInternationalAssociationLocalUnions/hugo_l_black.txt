justice

black
i
do
not
quite
understand,
(inaudible)
the
position
you're
taking
on.
this
seems
to
be
a
statement
made
to
a
mediator
between
you
and
the
union
and
on
certain
conditions,
you
would
be
certified
and
on
certain
conditions,
the
union
would
be
certified.
the
commentator
in
accordance
to
the
letter
of
transmissive,
they
did
december
(voice

justice
hugo

why
is
that
--
why
is
that
any
different
to
the
facts?
the
situations
that
would
have
existed
had
not
been
though
intermediate
and
you've
said
that
directed
to
union.
i
don't
quite
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
be
a
bargaining
undertaking
on
the
part
of
(inaudible),
certain
things
would
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
would
agree
to
certain
things
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
you
be
as
much
bound
and
why
wouldn't
they
be
as
much
bound
as
though
there
had
been
no
intermediary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
is
not,
why
is
it
not?
i
do
--
i
cannot
believe
you're
arguing
in
its
counter
effect
that
you
didn't
have
agreement
with
them
though
this
is
plainly
an
argument,
(voice

verdict.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
were
you
engaged
in
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
you
do
say
that
it's
contrary
that
is
bound
each
of
you
to
do
so
that
there
could
be
somewhere
an
action
both
to
be
--
to
be
enforceable
that
you
say
it
can't
be
done
under
301,
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
has
been
derived?
what
was
the
basis
of
this?
you
had
a
misunderstanding
about
the
strike,
didn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
all
this
was
--
it
was
involved
in
the
labor
dispute,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
each
of
you
made
an
undisputed
and
negotiated
through
these
people,
each
of
you
reached
to
conclusion
and
each
of
you
made
an
agreement.
then
why
could
it
not
be
enforced
under
301?
why
should
it
be
any
more
bar
than
any
other
agreement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
couldn't
well
be
said
it's
not
conflict,
could
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
bound,
you
said,
to
do
something
or
consideration
to
the
other
doing
something.
that
was
a
contract,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
before
it
(inaudible)
the
one
thing
or
another
--
why
was
this
in
void,
why
isn't
not
enforceable
as
any
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
provision
of
section
301
does
it
fail
to
meet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
this
was
not
collective
bargaining?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
didn't
--
you
met
with
--
you
met
with
them
(inaudible).
you
had
a
man
between
you,
you
say
that
at
the
agreement
bargain
to
negotiate,
he
gave
his
terms,
you
gave
yours
and
then
each
of
you
reached
to
conclusion
through
him
on
a
contract
that's
binding
but
not
under
301
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
frankly
cannot
see
why
this
is
not
--
what
i
would
know,
with
my
limited
understanding
of
it
a
negotiation
between
companies
and
the
union
through
somebody
else,
that
has
just
different
views,
if
i'm
going
to
reach
different
agreement,
the
union
would
agree
to
do
this,
about
this
employer,
the
other
people
agree
to
do
this,
and
i
can't
understand
why
that
would
not
be
enforceable
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
under
301
as
any
other
would?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
even
get
the
ground
on
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
my
fault
but
i
don't
understand,
but
i
just
don't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
the
labor
contract
of
that
kind
would
be
good?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
shows
that
it
was
take
place
for
a
time
and
you
mean
it
would
be
void
because
it
didn't
say
exactly
or
wouldn't
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
facing
anything,
are
you
on
the
fact
that
it
was
done
through
somebody
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
your
--
suppose
the
president
of
your
company
had
(inaudible)
to
the
president
of
the
union
and
they
were
afraid
to
meet,
face,
whatever
to
shoot
the
other,
but
they
did
want
to
see
if
they
can
get
together,
to
name
somebody
else
to
act
in
between
them
and
they
made
an
agreement
like
this.
would
you
say
that
is
a
binding
agreement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
didn't
they
do
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
didn't
agree
to
some
of
the
things
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
might
include.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that
sounds
to
me
like
one
of
your
items
as
(inaudible)
that
was
permitted
to
writing
and
both
sides
agreed
to
the
ride
into
which
it
was
committed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
says
we
talked
about
agreement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
agree
how
you'll
settle
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
if
obtained,
none
of
the
thing
that
collective
bargaining
agreement,
since
i've
ever
have
heard
about
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
provisions
of
section
4
put
it
on.
you
wanted
it
but
the
governor
will
not
reduce
rates
(voice

justice
hugo
l.

that
you
will
preserve
jobs
security,
that
you're
preserve
the
recreational
facilities
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
in
that
--
the
communist
thing
if
you
have
in
the
labor
agreements?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
you
want
--
what
was
the
purpose
in
warranting
your
client?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
are
you
warranting
it,
to
the
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
and
were
you
telling
them
not
to
go
and
get
the
other
people
that
we
need
to
do
certain
thing
or
shouldn't
that
the
other?
justice
hugo

just
saying
who
is
making
the
offer.
that
was
on
purpose
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
distributed
to
them,
through
them
and
they
will
send
it
back
to
you
and
this
is
the
agreement
you
reached.
justice

black
that
you'd
give
them
job
security
and
you
wouldn't
reduce
their
pay.
justice

you
say

do
you

justice

wasn't
it
in
effect?
justice
hugo

black
well
that
--
it
either
was
or
wasn't
in
your
judgment,
was
it
an
agreement
or
not?

i've
understood
you,
you've
been
saying
ever
since

got
up

they
did
have
a
contract,
they
wouldn't
want
--
one
you
could
sue
on

don't

are
you

between
these
people?

are
you
not
denying
if
there's
a

you
are
now
denying
there
is
a

well,
are
you
denying
there's
a
contract?
i
understand
you
said
it's
not
a
collective
bargaining.
but
that
you're
denying
of
the
contract.
what
are
these
things
signed
by
some
of
them
here
in
the
record?
why
were
they
signed
by
the
union
except
to

as
a
part
of
an
agreement
between
them?
justice

what
is
meant
by
this,
signed
by
line

that
make
it
operative,
the

so
forth
transmitted,
we
agree
that
the
success
of
the
undertaking,
instability
depend
upon
the
good
faith

so
forth,

they
signed
it
as
themselves
to
make
operative
this
agreement
which
you've
been
talking
about.
justice

and
so
did
the
