mr.
merrit
w.
green
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
if
the
court
please?
i
believe
that
the
outset
i
should
address
myself
very
briefly
to
the
suggestion
that
mootness
that
was
raised.
i
would
like
to
say
for
–
as
part
of
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
about
the
insurance
workers
case,
that
that
was
covered
in
the
footnote
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
light
of
the
ruling
on
the
merits,
there
is
no
point
in
determining
then
and
now
the
legal
status
of
a
predecessor
or
successor
union.
you
reached
that
what
was
important
that
came
up,
you
take
care
of
it
another
time.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
no
i
can't
recall
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
--
but
that
was
the
footnote
you
said
you
--
you
weren't
going
to
decide
that
and
it
wasn't
a
pertinent
view
of
your
decision
on
the
merits.
in
this
particular
situation,
this
did
not
come
to
counsel's
intention
--
attention
until
we
are
practically
finished
with
our
brief,
and
it
came
to
our
attention
only
through
receipt
of
reports
filed
with
the
labor
department
by
respective
labor
unions
under
the
labor
reform
act.
those
reports
revealed
that
three
labor
unions,
as
they
said
in
their
--
as
of
january
1,
1960,
this
local
merged
with
local
128
and
954
and
just
to
count
from
number
6
to
4
they
knew
local
954.
the
only
thing
i
can
say
to
you
about
this
local
--
this
new
local,
this
new
union
i
gather
from
the
contents
of
those
reports
that
i
have
filed
with
the
government
agency
is
that,
this
was
not
a
mere
change
in
identity
as
some
of
the
old
cases
of
where
they
changed
affiliations.
the
report
indicates
that
after
the
merge
and
after
the
formation
of
the
new
union,
the
members
of
locals
128
and
633
who
are
the
petitioners
here
comprised
about,
if
not
a
little
less,
but
let's
say
about
one-forth
of
the
total
membership
of
the
new
union.
the
officers
of
the
new
union
were
not
in
fact
the
same
officers.
there
are
only
two
officers
of
the
--
of
the
combined
633
and
128
petitioners
who
became
minor
officers
in
the
new
union.
i
thought
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
me
to
suggest
mootness
because
of
this
change
in
circumstances
because
if
per
chance
this
court
should
find
that
the
employers
here
were
parties
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
the
purpose
of
the
301
suit
then
of
course
you
have
to
take
the
other
side
of
the
coin
and
say,
“well,
this
new
union
be
responsible
for
all
the
obligations
that
133
--
and
128
and
633
might
have
had
during
the
course
of
their
existence,
including
damage
actions
and
things
of
that
nature.”
so
i
found
learning
that
there
was
a
material
difference
in
the
make
up
and
the
membership
of
these
unions.
i
thought
it
was
proper
and
incumbent
upon
me
to
bring
that
to
the
court's
attention.
and
one
other
thing
in
connection
with
that,
i
should
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
is
in
connection
with
mr.
lippman's
statement
that
a
function
within
the
organization
with
a
954
as
they
use
to.
well
now,
we
are
presently
and
i
think
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief
in
lasalle's,
one
of
the
respondents
here,
presently
has
pending
before
the
nlrb,
a
petition
for
election
by
local
954,
not
the
lasalle's
division
of
954
or
anything
else.
if
that
were
true,
then
the
--
these
divisions
within
the
union,
i
would
think
under
this
--
this
court's
holding
would
be
labor
organizations
and
they
too
would
have
to
comply
with
the
reporting
act
and
so
far
as
were
able
to
determine,
there
has
been
no
such
reports
made
by
labor
organizations
or
so
called
divisions,
department
store
divisions.
the
reason
of
mr.
lippman's
presentation
to
this
point,
i
feel
it's
incumbent
to
not
only
rearrange,
but
add
to
with
the
facts
that
he
gave,
in
order
that
the
court
might
get
a
better
backdrop
against
which
this
very
important
question
can
be
considered.
these
--
these
two
unions
and
for
convenience,
i'm
just
going
to
call
it
this
union,
had
for
many
years
as
he
said,
bargained
with
an
organization
of
multi
--
multi-employer
organiza
--
organization
known
as
retail
associates
inc.,
who
--
who
was
the
bargaining
agent
for
four
downtown
toledo
department
stores.
they
were
never
--
they
were
just
recognized.
they
were
never
certified.
there
has
never
been
in
an
election
among
the
employees.
in
1957
at
the
conclusion
or
an
impasse
was
receipt
--
was
reached
in
the
--
in
collective
bargaining
and
the
union
called
a
strike
against
retail
associates
and
part
of
their
strategy
was
to
start
(inaudible)
picketing.
they
picket
only
on
of
the
four
stores,
as
i
say
all
over
in
the
downtown
area
of
toledo.
they
picket
tikis.
tikis
immediately
within
a
day
withdrew
formerly
from
retail
associates
and
entered
into
direct
negotiations
with
the
union
and
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
union.
three
days
after
that,
on
november
20,
1957,
the
strike
started
on
the
november
15,
three
days
after
tikis
had
capitulated,
the
stores,
retail
associates,
filed
a
petition
with
the
nlrb,
asking
that
the
nlrb
conduct
an
election
among
the
employees
of
the
three
stores,
on
a
single
unit
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
union
did
in
fact
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees.
in
19
--
april
of
1958,
that's
five
month
later,
the
nlrb
finally
ordered
an
election
in
a
single
--
on
a
single
unit
basis
of
three
stores
whereupon
the
unions
filed
an
action
in
the
district
court
here
in
washington
and
was
successful
in
getting
an
injunction
restraining
the
nlrb
from
conducting
an
investigation
or
an
election.
now,
it's
necessary
for
me
to
flash
back.
after
the
retail
associates
filed
the
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i'm
going
to
pick
that
up
right
now
mr.
justice
black.
after
the
retail
associates
filed
the
request
for
an
election
on
november
20th,
three
days
thereafter,
there's
no
strike
--
there's
no
strike
activity
in
the
meantime,
on
november
23,
the
unions
notified
each
one
of
the
store
that
they
no
longer
wanted
to
bargain
on
the
basis
of
multi-employer
bargaining,
but
wanted
to
bargain
in
fact
with
each
store
separately.
so
that
when
--
in
april,
when
the
nlrb
ordered
the
election
on
a
single
unit
of
the
three
stores,
the
basis
of
the
injunction
action
was
that
the
employees
were
being
deprived
of
their
rights
in
being
forced
in
the
multi-employer
bargaining.
in
fact,
they
said
it
this
way
that
employers
were
permitted
to
withdraw
for
multi-employer
bargaining,
tikis,
the
union
should
have
the
same
right,
if
they
no
longer
wanted
to
engage
in
multi-employer
party.
and
therefore,
they
were
--
the
employees
were
being
deprived
of
their
rights
to
bargain
with
the
rights
to
have
them
on
the
act
to
bargain
separately
and
they
wanted
to
bargain
on
a
single
store
basis.
well,
the
local
court
–
the
district
court
here
in
washington
granted
a
temporary
injunction
and
no
appeal
was
taken
because
immediately
thereafter,
the
three
separate
stores
or
the
three
stores
separately
in
effect
disbanded
retail
associates.
and
the
three
stores
each
filed
a
petition
asking
that
the
nlrb
conduct
an
election
among
the
employees
of
the
respective
stores
and
a
unit
among
the
stores
only
like
the
union
had
wanted
--
said
they
wanted
to
bargain
for.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes
sir
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
think
it
is.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes
i
think
it
is,
in
our
--
in
this
nlrb
proceedings,
the
nlrb
laid
down
their
rules
for
withdrawal
from
multi-employer
or
multi-union
bargaining,
that
you
have
to
do
it
timely
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
now
i
think
--
i
think
the
law
settled
that
they
have
a
right
to
--
that
the
nlrb
has
the
right
to
constitute
a
union
of
four
stores,
or
five
stores,
or
single
classification
of
sales,
people
among
four
or
breakdown
into
various
kinds
of
effect.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes
in
the
lower
courts,
we
were
contending
that
we
have
the
right
on
the
(inaudible)
case
to
even
black
out
if
we
are
called
upon,
but
--
so
you
see
the
november
--
at
the
time
that
the
unions
notified
the
stores,
if
they
wanted
to
bargain
individually
that
was
on
november
23rd.
as
i
say,
the
--
the
--
at
that
time,
coincident
that
same
time
i
believe,
they
then
struck
the
sales
alone.
such
(inaudible)
events,
it
seems
to
us
then
made
the
lasalle's
strike
which
went
on
for
13
months,
a
really,
a
strike
for
recognition.
this
was
a
--
this
was
then
a
demand
for
individual
bargaining
and
lasalle's
was
just
saying
and
did
say
all
the
way
through
well
then
we
--
we
will
bargain
with
you
and
--
after
our
employees
have
a
vote
and
has
determined
that
you
represent
people.
well,
that
--
those
--
for
those
individual
petitions
were
filed
in
september.
immediately
therefore
and
even
before
with
the
nlrb
start
to
have
hearing,
the
unions
again
filed
a
suit
in
district
court
to
enjoin
the
nlrb
from
holding
hearings
because
in
the
meantime,
they
had
deliberately
permitted
their
compliance
with
the
non-communist
affidavit
to
elapse
and
then
they
went
into
court
and
said,
“we
know
--
we
haven't
filed
a
non-communist
affidavit
and
therefore
we're
not
entitled
to
use
the
facilities
of
the
board
and
therefore,
the
board
--
even
on
the
employer
petition
cannot
hold
a
hearing.”
that's
the
way
the
lower
courts
here
refused
to
grant
that
injunction
and
that
refusal
to
grant
the
injunction
to
prevent
the
hearings,
was
on
appeal
on
december
24th
when
this
matter
concluded.
at
that
same,
of
course,
the
petitions
for
election
were
--
on
the
individual
store
basis
that
they
wanted
were
pending.
well,
as
i
say
this
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes,
they
have
participated
in
the
nlrb
hearings
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
--
of
individual
store
basis.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
oh,
yes.
there's
--
they
made
a
demand.
they
said
that
they
wanted
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
not
the
right
to
be
a
--
the
representative
of
their
employees
but
they
claim
the
right
to
have
the
facilities
of
nlrb.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right,
that's
right.
well,
as
i
say
in
all
this
time
then
we
have
nothing,
but
more
or
less
at
lasalle's
as
they
strike
for
recognition
and
we're
saying
we
will
recognize
you
if
you're
--
if
you
let
us
have
an
election.
in
the
meantime,
the
--
i
should
say
this
now.
the
alliance
store
people,
they
may
have
a
strength,
nobody's
ever
allowed
to
work
at
the
alliance
store.
in
the
meantime,
as
department
stores
work
and
lasalle's
is
the
biggest
department
store
in
toledo
in
christmas
19
--
during
the
christmas
season
of
1957,
after
notice
required
to
the
people
and
opportunity
to
hold
their
jobs,
they
were
replaced,
permanently
replaced.
so,
that
really
the
strike
in
1958,
the
big
issue
then
was
put
our
people
back
to
work.
the
(inaudible)
officers
of
the
toledo
labor-management-citizen's
committee
that
referred
as
l-m-c
in
the
--
in
our
briefs,
monsignor
doyle
had
suggested
that
the
union
was
willing
to
wipe
out
this
whole
thing
by
saying
that,
“well,
we
don't
represent
these
people
and
we
won't
claim
to
represent
them
until
such
time
as
we
are
certified
by
an
nlrb
election.
and
this
whole
matter
can
be
settled
if
you'll
take
these
people
back
and
reemploy
them
and
reinstate
them
to
their
positions.”
now,
during
all
of
this
time,
our
conversation
with
l-m-c,
the
union
never
participated
at
any
save
one
which
was
the
night
of
december
20.
this
is
not
on
the
record
and
i
think
that
mr.
lippman
would
permit
me
the
letter
to
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
alright.
then
i
go
back
in
my
statement
that
during
all
the
time,
the
union
did
not
participate
in
this
so
called
“strike
settlement,”
the
l-m-c
talk
us
solely.
here's
what
took
place
then.
we
said
or
we
put
in
the
writing
and
gave
to
the
l-m-c
what
we
characterized
and
have
never
said
anything
different,
as
our
understanding,
the
statement
of
our
understanding
of
the
conditions
upon
which
the
union
terminated
its
strike.
there
has
never
been
any
signed
piece
of
paper.
there
has
never
been
as
mr.
lippman
insists,
no
negotiations
between
the
union
and
us
to
terminate
the
strike.
we
handed
the
l-m-c
and
said
now
this,
this
is
a
statement
of
understanding
and
these
are
the
conditions
under
which
we
understand
this
controversy
has
--
is
to
be
settled.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes
sir
and
i'll
cover
just
quickly
and
i
can
tell
you
just
what
it
was.
page
9
and
10
of
the
record,
this
was
appended
to
the
petition.
i
might
say
to
it
because
narrow
issue
here
of
only
whether
or
not
there
was
an
enforceable
contract
in
existence
between
employer
and
employee.
some
of
the
matter
that
was
before
judge
clove
in
the
district
court
is
not
here
which
was
stipulated
other
instruments
and
so
forth,
but
now
here's
all
of
the
--
all
--
all
the
statement
of
understanding
is
and
so
we
have
understanding.
we
just
said
we'll
reinstate
the
employees.
that's
on
page
number
9.
that's
number
1
and
without
any
loss
of
seniority
and
without
any
--
any
discrimination.
and
we'll
reinstate
them
to
their
former
position
classifications
if
available.
at
this
point,
i
want
to
correct
one
of
things
that
mr.
lippman
said
and
that
was
that
this
arbitration
was
over
the
reinstatement
of
two
workers,
that
isn't
the
fact,
as
i
will
show
you
in
just
a
minute.
third
paragraph
of
the
statement
is
just
to
saying
that
we
understand
that
there
are
going
to
be
good
employees
and
number
4
lasalle's
said
to
l-m-c,
“we'll
work
to
ul-m-c
that
will
not
reduce
any
of
the
pay
rates
now
in
effect.
we
won't
do
these
other
things.
there'd
be
no
recriminations
and
so
forth.
now,
the
wage
schedules
which
are
the
record
between
11
and
34,
the
wage
schedules
and
the
so
called
personnel
policy
were
given
to
l-m-c
at
their
request
so
that
if
something
came
up
in
the
mean
--
later
on,
they
would
have
an
available.
there
isn't
one
thing
in
that
wage
schedule
as
the
stipulation
to
which
i'm
going
to
refer
in
a
minute
shows,
none
of
the
wages,
none
of
the
working
conditions,
none
of
the
terms
of
employment,
nothing,
nothing
in
--
in
the
exhibit
a
and
b
which
contained
in
the
record
were
the
result
of
--
none
of
those
things
were
the
result
of
negotiations
between
these
labor
unions
and
the
employers.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
these
--
these
were
the
--
the
wages
--
the
wages
were
in
existence
at
that
time.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
as
the
court
will
notice
that
the
effect
--
these
effective
dates
of
this
wage
--
wage
rates
was
a
--
well,
one
of
them
went
back
to
november
1,
1957,
the
other
went
back
september
8
--
september
1
of
1958
and
this
wasn't
handed
to
the
union
until
december
24,
1958
or
to
the
l-m-c.
well,
then
in
paragraph
5
of
the
statement
of
understanding,
all
we
said
there
that
neither
the
–
it's
understood
that
neither
the
company
of
the
union
will
interfere
with
the
rights
granted
to
these
people
under
--
under
section
7and
8
of
act.
that's
just
the
restatement
of
their
--
of
their
privileges
and
then
we
went
out
to
say
that
now
look,
nothing
that's
contained
in
this
thing
as
to
be
construed
by
anybody
that
this
is
recognition
of
the
union
as
the
barging
agent
for
these
people,
for
anybody.
and
the
union
was
our
understanding,
sat
down
--
see
it's
our
understanding
that
the
union
will
not
request
barging
rights.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes,
that's
right.
that
was
their
--
their
words
that
l-m-c
said
to
us
that,
“now
look,
if
you
take
these
people
back,
the
union
will
agree
that
will
not
request
barging
rights.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
this
is
our
understanding
justice
brennan.
as
our
understanding
that
the
--
in
our
statement
at
l-m-c,
this
is
our
understanding
that
the
union
agrees
that
they're
not
going
to
request
barging
rights.
now
and
here
is
one
of
the
key
parts
of
this
whole
lawsuit.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i'm
sorry.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
i'm
sorry
if
didn't
but
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
it
was
a
--
an
ex
--
or
as
a
unilateral
statement
on
our
part
saying
to
l-m-c
that
is
our
--
this
is
our
--
and
you
represented
--
you
represented
to
us
that
the
union
will
agree
that
they
will
not
request
barging
rights
until
they're
certified
--
unless
and
until
they're
certified.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
think
so,
under
the
ohio
law.
i
think
under
the
ohio
law,
they
could
have
sued
not
only
under
--
i
think
they
can
sue
in
the
declare
--
declaratory
judgment
acts.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
no.
well,
yeah
--
of
the
individual
employees
or
the
union
could
have
--
oh,
i
see,
you
mean
--
you
means
as
to
bargaining
rights?
mr.
merrit
w.
green
no,
i
don't
think
everybody
can
sue.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
i
don't
think
anymore
than
--
than
that.
they
have
--
they
would
have
that
--
we
will
still
have
the
right
to
say,
“well
if
you
claim
you
represent
the
people,
they
will
file
--
will
file
a
petition
and
get
election
you
see.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
don't
think
that
would
be
the
key
clause
in
whether
or
not
they
could.
i
think
may
--
that
may
come
a
little
later.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
december
24.
i
think
that's
a--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes,
i
think
to
its
legal
effect,
because
that's
the
question
of
the
lawsuit
whether
or
not
there
--
where
there
was
any
--
any
right
of
the
union
as
the
union
to
bring
an
action
to
enforce
a
so
called
award.
as
i
said
at
the
--
near
the
outset,
this
statement
of
understanding
that
we
gave
to
them
was
--
to
the
l-m-c,
was
our
understanding
of
the
conditions,
out
forth
either
by
the
union
or
ourselves
as
to
basis
on
which
the
strike
of
the
union
was
terminated.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
think
that's
true.
in
other
words
we've
said
to
them
that
we'll
do
these
things.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
think
that's
true
within
the
proper
--
in
the
proper
type
of
action.
we
would
be
bound
on
the
certain
circumstances
for
certain
things
and
i
think
the
union
would
be
bound.
now
whether
or
not
the
union
--
whether
or
not
this
is
a
30
--
section
301
case,
i
mean
a
contract
which
is
enforceable
under
section
301
which
is
a
limited
jurisdiction
section
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes,
this
part
is
--
this
the
agreement.
well,
we
say
it
mr.
justice
black
that's
our
position
that
we
were
not
--
there
was
not
an
existence
a
contract
between
an
employer
engaging
in
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes,
that's
right
and
union
representing
employees
as
this
contemplated
by
section
301
which
permits
an
action
to
be
filed
for
a
breach
of
contract
without
meeting
the
necessary
jurisdictional
requirements
of
a
--
of
a
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
we
say
that
actually
that
--
that
301
contemplates
a
collective
bargaining
contract
or
a
contract
derived
that
as
a
result
of
collective
bargaining
between
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
the
strike--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
sir,
the
strike
was
not
as
i
--
as
we've
view
it
the
november
23
strike
against
lasalle's
only
was
not
as
the
basis
--
it
was
not
an
economic
strike,
let
me
put
it
that
way.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
it
involved
in
the
labor
dispute,
i
think
it
was
a
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
i
don't
believe
i
can
answer
you
at
this
time
and
i
think
i
have
--
i
have
the
answer
in
brief,
over
and
beyond
saying
that
we
do
not
believe
in
this
respect,
of
course
we
hardly
agree
with
the
district
court
that
this
contract
if
you
will,
to
use
the
phrase
that
you
used
and
i'm
not
saying
it's
not.
well,
it's
not
the
type
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
sir?
mr.
merrit
w.
green
it
may
unlike
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
there
maybe
an
understanding
agreement
between
us
to
do
something
to
whether
be
legally
binding
contracts
such
as
you're
going
to
have
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
we
don't
say
it's
in
void.
we
say
that
to
the
extent
of
which
--
of
what
is
this
contained
therein,
it's
alright.
we're
saying
but
it
does
not
meet
the
requirements
of
a
contract
within
the
contemplation
of
section
301
of
the
act.
that's
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
301
(a).
mr.
merrit
w.
green
we
--
we
say
that
that
this
is
not
--
no,
what
we're
saying
that
301
(a)
contemplates
a
contract
arrived
at
by
reason
of
collective
bargaining
as
defined
in
the
act.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
we
have
never
--
we
never
met
with
the
union
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right
mr.
justice
black
i'll
tell
you,
only
--
may
i
just
add
one
more
thing
to
that.
it
is
stipulated
in
the
record,
and
this
is
the
area
upon
which
enforcement
of
the
so
called
“arbitration
award”
is
requested,
but
it's
stipulated
in
the
record
that
none
of
the
wages
or
personnel
policies
or
anything
else
were
the
result
of
negotiation
between
the
stores
and
the
union
or
the
l-m-c
on
behalf
of
the
union.
the
l-m-c
had
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
wage
rates
or
anything
of
that
nature.
now,
may
i
proceed?
i
don't
--
i
believe
mr.
justice
black,
i
can't
answer
you
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
enforceable.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
here
--
i
think
here
is
the
--
maybe
--
maybe
this
might
help
explain
my
position
that
maybe
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
you
see,
we
say
that
301
require
--
permits
a
filing
of
a
lawsuit
for
breach
contract
entered
into
between
the
employer
and
the
labor
union
representing
the
employees
as
which
was
result
a
collective
bargaining.
now,
collective
bargaining
and
this
i
think,
if
i
can
read
just
a
few
lines
here,
might
distinguish
between
the
so
called
agreement
--
what
agreement
we're
talking
about
here
and
the
one
that's
contemplated
for
enforcement
under
301.
section
8
(d)
or
some
--
i
think
it's
8
(d)
of
the
act
defines
collective
bargaining
in
this
way,
to
bargain
collectively
as
a
performance
of
the
mutual
obligation
of
the
employer
and
the
representative
of
the
employees
to
meet
at
reasonable
times
and
confirm
good
faith
with
respect
to
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
for
the
negotiation
of
an
agreement
or
any
question
arising
there
under
and
the
execution
of
a
written
contract
incorporating
any
agreement
reached
if
requested
by
either
party,
such
obligation
does
not
compel
someone
to
agree
to
proposal
while
making
a
concession,
meaning
of
course,
you
still
have
your
right
to
strike
and
so
forth.
so
that
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
think
we
are
saying
that
our
statement
of
understanding
does
not
fall
within
this
definition
of
what
collective
bargaining
is.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
there's
no
obligation
for
us
to
meet
a
periodic
time
for
renegotiating
or
--
or
to
change
the
contract.
there's
nothing
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
a
labor
contract
could
be
one
that
didn't
have
a
termination
period
or
requirement
that
you
meet
at
frequent
times
or
that
you
have
a
mutual
obligation
to
contract.
i
don't
believe
a
labor
contract
that
did
not
have
a
termination
date
at
least
the
under
board
law,
they
have
said
that
any
contract
beyond,
i
believe
it's
three
years
would
not
be
a
contract
bar
if
someone
came
in
and
want
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
no,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
that.
i
mean,
to
say
only
that,
that
is
one
indicia
that
it's
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
contemplated
by
the
labor
act
in
section
301.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
no,
that's
right.
i'm
--
i'm
saying
--
i'm
going
back
to
the
stipulation
of
neither
the
labor
union
or
l-m-c
for
the
labor
union
engaged
in
any
collective
bargaining
as
defined
in
act
that
i
just
read
there.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes
sir.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
here's,
i
think
the
latter
situation
you
described
was
this
one.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
if
--
because
of
those
periods
or
anything
may
i
as
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
the
thing
that
you
are
describing
is
almost
the
number
one
situation
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
now,
if
those
two
people
or
the
person
that
the
president
of
the
company
and
the
head
of
the
union
designated
to
do
this,
if
he
was
authorized
to
and
in
fact
did
arrive
at
disputes
on
wage
rates,
on
overtime,
on
vacation
and
so
forth,
there
isn't
any
question
that
--
that
the
result
of
his
mediation,
if
agreed
too,
would
be
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
oh,
no,
oh
no.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
the
only
thing
they
agreed
is
what
is
in
this
first
--
this
paragraph
right
here.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
don't
believe
mr.
justice
black
as
i
interpret
the
statement
of
understanding
that
there
is
anything
really
in
there,
in
the
statement
of
understanding
with
the
possible
exception
of
item
number
7
which
the
key
of
this
whole
lawsuit.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
the
only
thing
that's
common
to
us
--
really
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes
sir.
we
actually
--
we
want
it
--
yes
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
oh
at
that
time
if
they
were
--
they
were
--
they
would
have
withdraw,
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
you
know
the
question
of
governing
of
unfair
labor
practices
and
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes,
i
think
they
would
have,
but
i
think
they
would
avoid
it.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
a
sense
of
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
no.
i
think
what
you're
talking
about,
are
you
not,
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
rights
within
the
state
courts
rather
than
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
there
is
an
agreement
to
do
--
they
would
draw
the
picket
line,
we'd
take
the
people
back,
all
these
things
are
here
but
we
say
that
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes.
i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
no.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that'
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
no
i
don't
believe
that
was
ever
within
contemplation
of
the
parties
(inaudible)
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes.
i
think
those
are
the
things
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
so
that
we
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
we
were
saying
that
the
--
to
l-m-c
that
we
could
assure
you
that
we
are
not
going
to
--
these
people
come
back
to
work,
we're
not
going
to
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
i
don't
know
who
is
making
the
first
offer
to
do
what.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
think
that
that
was
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
there
isn't
any
question
about
that.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
i
don't
say
--
well
again,
we
get
back
to
what
we
were
talking
about
before
is
to
what
that
--
the
narrow
issue
here
is
of
course
is
whether
or
not
this
is
that
type
of
contract
under
the
301.
these
other
things,
well
they
can
enforce
it
or
not,
those
are
some
secondary
issues
that
are
down
the
road.
for
--
for
instance,
you
would
have
communist
union
where
they're
proper
plaintiffs
and
i
think
that's
what
judge
paul
was
talking
about
that
the
question
that
justice
stewart
raised.
in
other
words,
we're
talking
about
agreement.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
that's
in
the
record
you
see
but
the
--
in
the
--
the
key
to
this
thing
for
instance,
as
i
say,
this
is
down
the
road.
the
so
called
grievance
procedure
says,
“any
individual
employee
who
may
have
a
grievance
may
do
certain
things.”
i
mean
if
he
can't
solve
the
grievance
then
he
can
go
to
--
to
l-m-c.
there's
no
place
in
here
does
it
say
that
the
labor
unions
may
agree
as
such,
nor
is
there
anything
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
no,
no,
no,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
no,
i
don't
think
that
whether
it
was
signed
or
not
with
a
--
even
if
we
were
to
sign
it,
i
don't
think
that
we've
been
more
liable,
signs
this
agreement,
i
don't
think
that's
it.
you
see
--
you
did
have
these
two
things
here,
the
labor
union
brings
us
action
for
its
own
benefit.
i
don't
think
they're
a
recipient
under
7,
under
section
7
because
the
only
person
who
had
the
right
to
agree
under
the
agreement,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
was
the
individual
employee.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
that
was
a
--
that
was
an
understanding
between
the
people.
that
was
the
agreement
and
let's
--
let's
say
it's
the
agreement.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
we
don't
--
we
think
it
was
an
agreement
to
do
certain
things,
but
was
not
an
agreement
which
met
the
requirements
of
section
301
(a)
to
enable
a
labor
union
which
was
not
a
party
to
it
as
such
to
bring
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
don't
think
that
made
a
difference
(voice
overlap)
mr.
merrit
w.
green
no
i
don't
that
think
it
made
a
difference.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
think
that's
true.
you
see
--
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
if
we
had
the
whole
--
their
whole
feeling,
i
suppose
that
would
be
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
what
they
have
done
there
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
there
isn't
any
quite
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
repudiate
that
we
entered
into
what
set
forth
in
their
statement
of
understanding.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
may
we
test
that
by
something
right
out
of
that
very
same
letter?
in
the
3rd
paragraph,
this
is
--
we're
talking
about
3rd
--
page
35.
this
is
also
what
they
said.
that
agreement
specifically
states
that
nothing
in
the
agreement
will
preclude
an
employee
represented
from
entering
the
store
to
communicate
with
employees
on
the
latter's
own
time
providing
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
store
operations.
now,
what
does
the
agreement
provide
on
page
10.
here,
it
says
and
notes
the
difference,
“nothing
herein
shall
preclude
an
employee
representative
from
entering
areas
of
the
store
which
are
open
to
the
public.”
mr.
merrit
w.
green
or
from
communicating
so
forth.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right
now,
that
was
their
intent
to
do
that.
it's
our
view
that
in
this
particular
case
and
this
was
--
this
would
be
a
question
that
would
come
up
later
on
if
we
have
to
go
back
is,
did
this
award
come
within
section
7;
the
so-called
“arbitration
section.”
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
know
we're
not
there
you
see
--
you
see
--
and
that
would
be
a
very
question.
number
one,
would
--
would
they
be
proper
plaintiffs
to
bring
the
action,
and
was
this
award
within
the
--
the
steelworker's
cases;
the
three
steelworker's
cases.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
what
--
that
was
right.
the
--
the
steelworker's
cases
won't
be
cited
in
this
case.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
you'll
forgive
me
but
i
really
don't
understand
your
question
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
any
difference
than
it
is
now.
i
think
that
--
the
lawyers
have
just
been
putting
down
their
understanding
of
the
conditions
under
--
once
the
strike
was
terminated
and
that
would
not
result
in
the
conversations
between
the
lawyers
where
they
did
not
enter
in
there
any
negotiation
as
to
wages,
hours,
working
conditions,
terms
of
employment
and
so
forth.
i
don't
think
--
which
i
can't
--
which
i
think
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
contemplating
the
301.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
have
two,
i
mean
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right
mr.
chief
justice
and
i'll
tell
you
why
it
was
put
in
there.
we
weren't
going
to
stipulate
--
the
unions
weren't
going
to
stipulate
itself
out
of
court
and
we
weren't
going
to
stipulate
then
in
the
court.
we
were
going
to
say
that
these
were
all
the
facts
and
we're
not
--
none
of
these
things
were
negotiated,
but
this
--
if
the
court
thinks
that
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
because
that
was
the
very
knob
of
the
jurisdictional
question,
then
of
course
we're
not
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
court
then,
only
we're
saying
then
that
under
all
these
facts
then
the
court
first
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
because
that
was
the
very
issue
in
the
lawsuit.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
i
have
of
fact,
yes.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
well,
we
weren't
saying
that
--
that
--
by
that
we
weren't
saying
that
there
was
a
--
or
was
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
were
just
saying
that
if
we
tried
this
lawsuit,
these
facts,
we'll
stipulate
that
these
facts
would
--
would
be
developed.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well
it
just
says
that
that
the
stipulation
of
the
facts
doesn't
preclude
the
court
from
finding
it
was.
i
think
maybe
the
negative,
the
--
the
other
way,
we
started
out
saying
that
the
one
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
my
whole
lawsuit.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes.
well,
i
think
that's
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
thing
that
the
court
found
and
i
base
that
primarily
on
the
bargaining
or
i
mean
on
the
legislative
history
of
this
whole
thing.
after
all,
employers
prior
to
the
enactment
of
301
as
i
understood,
were
suitable
for
breaches
of
--
the
claim
breaches
of
contracts
by
unions,
or
as
there
was
some
difficulty
if
not
impossible
to
sue
unions.
and
the
--
as
i
read
the
--
about
the
history
--
legislative
history,
the
main
purpose
of
this
enactment
was
to
make
unions
responsible
for
breaches
of
contract
and
then
in
the
--
it
seems
as
though
that
when
they
get
down
to
the
enactment
of
the
section,
the
house
--
the
senate
or
the
house
agreement
changed
the
--
changed
the
sections
to
include
also
breaches
of
contract
between
labor
unions.
and
therefore,
they
had
to
change
their
original
senate
language
from
contracts
as
a
result
of
collective
bargaining
to
make
it
apply
to
both
types
of
contracts;
to
contracts
between
employers
and
employees,
represent
these
employees
and
labor
unions.
now
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
in
view
of
this
court's
case
in
the
ladies'
garment
workers
in
1961
where
they
struck
down
a
contract
which
the
union
tried
to
keep
in
existence
as
a
members
only
contract
where
this
court
said
that
even
though
the
employer
and
the
union
mistakenly
entered
in
--
good
faith,
entered
into
a
contract
as
--
as
though
they
were
the
majority
representative
that
therefore,
they
violated
the
act
and
the
members
only
aspect
of
it
could
not
be
maintained.
now,
i
think
it
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes,
that
was
a
--
that's
right,
where
the
nlrb
made
them
--
have
an
election
even
though
in
the
mean
time,
they'd
become
the
majority
representative.
now,
of
course,
you
got
to
remember
here
that
the
effect
of
your
decision
to
say
that
this
was
a
some
type
of
an
action
that
this
court
had
jurisdiction
over
this
type
of
an
agreement
would
be,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
does
not
--
this
is
not
restricted
to
members
only;
the
members
of
these
unions.
it
would
involve
the
employees
of
three
stores
but
the
effect
would
be
--
that
by
decree
of
the
court,
you
would
be
bringing
in
to
an
existence
a
labor
contract
in
which
these
unions
had
the
right
to
represent
all
of
the
employees
even
though
they
have
admitted
that
they
were
not
--
the
representative
of
the
majority.
you
see,
that's
really
what's
in
the
knob,
what
will
happen?
mr.
merrit
w.
green
it
may
be
possible
as
justice
douglas
pointed
out
on
his
dissent
under
the
ladies
garment
workers
for
an
employer
and
employee
to
enter
into
a
members
only
contract
so
long
as
it
doesn't
extend
privileges
to
that
union
to
do
things
that
--
that
only
majority
representatives
to
do.
now,
in
this
case
of
course,
this
action
was
not
brought
out
on
the
base
of
this
members
only
contract
or
that
they
were
bringing
the
action
only
for
them,
that
was
nothing
the
pleadings
on
that
you
see.
in
view
of
the
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
the
court
held
that
they
did
have
the
--
this
right,
it
would
extend
to
the
employees
of
all
three
of
these
stores
because
it's
the
--
the
so
called
statement
of
understanding
does
not
limit
it
to
only
their
members,
you
see.
and
what
you
would
be
doing
is
by
court
decree
bringing
in
to
existence
a
collective
bargaining
contract
where
this
union
would
have
a
right
to
--
to
negotiate
or
arbitrate,
to
do
all
these
things
on
behalf
of
these
--
these
people
and
bring
suits
under
301
and
we
don't
believe
that
is
really
what
--
was
within
the
contemplation
of
the
labor
policy.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
46
did
you
say
your
honor?
mr.
merrit
w.
green
(voice
overlap)
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
believe
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
and
then
on
page
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
think
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
and
i
think
though
your
latter
statement
was
(inaudible)
doesn't
the
--
does
the
statement
of
the
findings
of
fact
on
page
49,
clear
up
and
put
down
on
a
nutshell
what
he's
talking
about.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
he
says
--
in
number
3
that
the
statements
of
understanding
are
not
collective
bargaining
contracts
negotiated
by
or
on
behalf
o
the
plaintiffs
with
either
of
the
defendants.
then
in
number
4,
he
says,
“there
as
no
existing
collective
bargaining
contract
between
the
plaintiffs
and
either
of
the
defendants.”
isn't
he
saying
there
therefore
that
first,
you
have
to
have
a
contract
breached
between
--
in
between
an
employer
and
employee
which
is
breached
to
bring
a
suit
under
301.
and
i
think
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i
don't
think
he's
saying
that.
oh
no,
i
think
i
think
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
no
i
think
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
i
think
that's
true.
no,
i
don't
believe
that
--
i
think
if
they
could
meet
the
jurisdictional
requirements.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes,
well
you
see,
you
can
have
contracts
that
would
be
enforceable
in
--
in
the
higher
courts
that
would
not
be
301
contracts.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well
i
(voice
overlap)
if
i
did,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
--
i've
meant
to
say
they
just
--
that
this
was
a
--
is
understanding
given
to
the
l-m-c
of
the
conditions
circumstance
under
which
the
strike
was
terminated.
now,
let's
say
it's
this
contract.
it's
an
agreement
between
these
two
people.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
and
they
could
bring
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
they
could
bring
--
no,
and
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
ohio
courts
would
have
jurisdiction
or
that'd
be
jurisdiction
within
ohio
courts
to
bring
the
action,
what
the
result
would
be.
now,
that's
another
thing.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
a
collective
bargain
contract.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
that
--
for
our
purpose
here
today,
let's
say
that
the
--
the
employees
have
rights
enforceable
in
court
under
the
terms
of
this
statement
of
understanding.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
because
of
the
contents
of
this
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
well,
yes.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
that's
right.
no
i'm
not
saying
--
mr.
merrit
w.
green
i'm
not
saying
mr.
justice
black
that
the
employees
do
not
have
rights
that
bring
an
action
on
the
basis
of
what
they're
entitled
to
one
of
that
agreement.
i
think
they
would
have
a
right,
but
they
wouldn't
have
a
right
under
301
because
that's
only
between
employer
and
employee.
mr.
merrit
w.
green
yes,
i
think
they'd
have
that
right,
(inaudible)
question.
