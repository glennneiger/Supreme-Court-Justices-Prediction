justice
felix
frankfurter
but
no
--
no
arrangement
can
be
made
with
such
an
outside
body
that's
different
from
arrangements
made
with
reference
to
other
employees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
mr.
green.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
--
is
the
law
settle
as
to
whether
the
board
may
in
its
discretion
not
only
determine
what
is
a
proper
unit
within
a
single
enterprise,
but
bunched
together
more
than
one
enterprise
for
a
separate
union?
it
isn't
relevant
to
this
case.
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
just
curious
as
evidently
justice
black
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
the
district
court
here
granted
a
temporary
injunction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
staying
that
kind
of
a
proceeding
note
that
you
stated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
the
--
with
this
union
as
a
--
as
the
designated
potential
representative?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
indicated
--
but
that
you
indicated
--
but
you
indicated
their
right
to
become
a
bargaining
agency
had
lapsed
because
of
the
failure
to
filed
(inaudible)
anit
communism
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
means
you
conduct
to
--
to
be
so
designated
to
an
election.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
be
very
specific,
these
were,
what
you
say
so,
these
were
unilateral
store
policies,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
not
initiated
entirely
emanating
from
the
store?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
have
fully
answered
justice
brennan's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
union
agrees,
is
that
--
is
that
on
its
part
a
unilateral
statement
or
is
that
an
undertaking
again
and
if
so,
to
whom
was
the
undertaking
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
anybody
sue
on
that
agreement
either
the
covenantee
or
third
party
beneficiary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
stores
could
have
sued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
just
a
declaration
of
policy
by
the
union
you
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
but
i
mean
that
mean
as
a
--
as
a
--
on
the
basis
of
the
union
agrees,
you
say
no
--
no
simple
damages
or
no
injunction
to
specific
performance
or
negative
injunction
to
enjoin
disobedience
would
lie.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
to
forget
all
about
301?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
a
moment,
just
forget
about
it.
it
doesn't
exist.
pre
301,
if
i
may
draw
on
personal
experiences,
in
more
than
one
situation
like
this,
i
was
in
the
position
of
[in
monsignor
doyle,
a
mediator
between
two
parties
neither
in
which
the
employers
would
under
no
circumstances,
sit
down
and
bargain
with
the
union.
now,
there
are
two
kinds
of
mediation
in
such
a
situation
and
i've
been
through
both
of
those.
in
one
in
which
terms
of
agreement
are
made
between
the
employer
and
the
union
through
the
conduit
of
the
mediator,
but
they
have
been
great
hostility,
they
don't
want
us
to
go
down
the
same
rule.
in
the
other,
and
these
were
cases
during
the
war,
no
this
last
war
but
the
first
world
war
and
the
other
where
neither
would
talk
to
the
other,
would
have
anything
to
do,
which
was
conscious
of
public
responsibility
and
each
side
made
concession
to
the
representative
of
the
government
not
by
way
of
any
agreement
with
the
union
remotely.
that's
just
what
they
would
resist
to
the
death
but
they
would
make
concessions
to
the
government
mediator.
now,
those
are
two
very
different
situations
for
the
intervention
of
the
mediator
and
i
want
to
know
which
this
was,
forgetting
all
about
301.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
impossible
on
the
ohio
law,
forget
about
301.
is
there
any
--
is
that
enforceable,
would
that
enforceable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
it
could
be
only
be
impossible
if
you
make
a
voluntary
--
if
you
stand
on
the
--
in
the
most
prominent
place
in
toledo
city,
i
don't
know,
i've
never
been
there
and
make
a
--
and
make
a
pronouncement
of
what
you
do,
that
wouldn't
be
enforceable
in
the
court
of
law,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
citizens
might
think
ill
of
you
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera
and
pressure
might
be
brought
to
bear
on
you
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
nobody
can
go
and
sue
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
union
says,
we'll
do
so
on
and
so,
all
on
its
own.
nobody
could
go
into
a
court
in
ohio,
and
just
force
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
was
that
--
this
situation
was,
your
situation,
that
kind
of
a
thing
or
was
it
a
conjoined
sub-consensus
of
agreement
between
two
people
forgetting
about
301
in
which
there
would
be
a
suit;
a
potential
suit
in
ohio
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
for
me
it's
decisive,
that
question
is
decisive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
green,
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this
question.
before
i
reverse
the
judge;
i'd
like
to
know
what
he's
decided.
i
thought
that
judge
kloeb
had
ruled
and
that's
the
opinion
on
--
in
fact
that's
the
opinion
of
court
of
appeals
of
course,
by
adoption
if
it
were.
i
thought
he
had
ruled
that
the
301,
this
is
not
--
does
not
come
within
enforcement
under
301
because
301
has
a
specialized
conception
of
what
is
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
and
i
have
read
very
carefully,
i
think
i
can
say
very
carefully;
reread
and
judge
kloeb's
opinion
and
i
am
less
in
doubt
whether
that's
what
he's
decided
at
least
there
are
(inaudible)
through
findings
that
he
decided
that
301
requires
(inaudible)
of
a
particular
kind
of
a
contract.
can
i
call
your
attention
to
three
items
which
--
out
of
which
--
which
to
deal
them
together
all
into
one,
of
the
mere
cloud
as
to
what
he's
really
decided.
on
page
46
in
the
2nd
open
paragraph,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
346
of
the
record.
he
displayed
his
position,
etcetera
that
in
these
statements,
these
statements
of
plaintiffs
constitute
a
contract,
at
least
a
contract
for
the
benefit
of
plaintiffs,
and
that
it
is
there
for
such
a
contract
as
it's
contemplated
by
section
301.‚Äù
constituted
contract,
now
that's,
at
least,
the
contract
for
the
benefit
of
plaintiffs.
the
implication
is
that
might
have
been
a
contract
between
him
and
monsignor
doyle's
committee.
as
i
turn
to
page
47,
next
to
the
last
paragraph,
the
last
sentence,
the
agreement
that
we
are
here
considering
is
a
strike
settlement
agreement
which
we
cannot
construe
as
having
been
entered
into
for
the
benefit
of
plaintiffs
and
that
looks
to
me
like
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
so
called
the
2nd
kind
of
thing
that
i
was
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
made
strike
settlements
which
were
certainly
not
agreements
between
employers
and
employees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
2
and
2
make
4.
now
thirdly,
next
to
the
last
full
paragraph
on
page
48,
that
none
of
the
factors
and
so
on
which
gives
substance
rights
of
the
unions
to
bring
actions
on
the
section
of
301
are
present
in
this
case
and
particularly
a
contract
between
plaintiffs
and
defendants.
but
i
can't
imagine
anybody
would
contend
it
if
there's
no
contract
between
employers
and
employees,
you
have
a
suit,
the
basis
for
suit
under
301.
i
don't
suppose
anybody
would
contend
that,
at
least
i
don't
tend
they
suggested
yet,
that
is
the
(inaudible)
case,
but
is
it
particularly
the
contract
of
being
plaintiff
and
defendant
so
that
those
three
items
together
make
me
--
leave
me
in
doubt
as
to
what
it
is
that
judge
kloeb
really
has
decided.
has
he
decided
there
was
no
contract
on
the
--
on
the
claims
in
this
case
including
the
stipulation
or
has
he
decided
all
though
there
was
a
contract,
it
was
not
the
kind
of
contract
that
301
looks
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'd
like
to
have
you
comment
on
that
just
i
hope
mr.
lippman
would
say
something
about
it.
that
doesn't
settle
the
controversy
but
it
does
settle
--
i
should
like
to
know
what
it
is
kloeb
went,
judge
kloeb
went
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
but
he
said
that
forget
all
about
301,
that
there's
no
enforceable
right
under
--
under
contract
law
of
the
state
of
ohio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
if
there
is
then
i
don't
--
then
you
start
me
all
over
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
a
contract
either
between
a
and
b
or
between
a
and
x
where
the
3rd
party
is
the
beneficiary,
then
you've
got
other
on
that
one
situation.
if
you
say
there
is
no
such
consensual
agreement,
either
directly
between
the
parties
or
for
one
of
the
parties
enforceable
by
a
third
party,
you've
got
another
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
jurisdictional
requirement
derives
from
an
answer
to
that
question.
jurisdiction
follows
the
gist
of
a
contract.
if
you
got
no
contract,
of
course
you
have
--
you
haven't
gotten
the
basis
for
301.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you've
got
a
contract
then
you
may
have
the
correction
which
justice
brennan's
invited
your
attention
toward
the
end,
namely
the
assumption
that
although
you
have
a
contract
between
employer
and
employee
or
a
contract
by
employer
for
the
benefit
of
the
employee,
you
haven't
got
a
301
kind
of
a
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
are
these
people
though,
that's
the
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
just
like
to
know
what
i'm
dealing
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
he
says
in
that
sentence
on
page
47.
the
agreement
that
we
are
here
considering
is
a
strike
settlement.
i
can
assure
you
mr.
lippman
i've
made
--
i
was
a
counsel
for
a
commission
and
acted
for
it
and
made
a
number
of
strike
settlements
so
denominated
in
the
press
and
by
everybody
else
and
then
you
report
to
the
president,
there
were
strike
settlements
but
under
no
circumstances
where
the
enforceable
contracts
between
the
parties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
may
be
--
i'm
not
saying
that
--
i'm
not
saying
any
of
these
things.
i'm
not
saying
that
he
was
right
in
saying
that
there
was
no
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
he
was
right
that
if
there
was
a
contract,
it
was
not
the
kind
of
a
contract
under
301.
i'm
not
saying
either
of
those
things.
i
just
--
i
do
think
there
are
distinctions
between
saying
that
although
you've
got
an
enforceable
contract
either
directly
enforceable
as
between
the
parties
or
because
the
third
party
beneficiary,
you
do
not
come
within
301.
those
are
very
different
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
he
said
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
no
one
presents
in
this
case
particularly
of
contract
between
plaintiffs
and
defendants
on
page
48.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
you
in
this
case
below
mr.
lippman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wondered
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
got
off
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
(inaudible)
the
way
that
it
conducted
(inaudible)
