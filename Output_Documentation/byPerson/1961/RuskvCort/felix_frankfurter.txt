any
effort
made
--
any
effort
made
after
the
disposition
by
the
district
court
to
open
up
the
so
called
factual
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
suggestion
that
summary
judgment
isn't
a
good
way
of
summary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
specifically
test
here
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
a
scheme
unique
for
this,
for
the
application
for
a
passport?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
date
of
this
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
originated
in
1952?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
according
to
your
view,
it
would've
required
this
procedure
to
be
followed
by
ms.
elg,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
this
is
an
exclusive,
is
this
permitted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
you,
this
is
an
exclusive
to
people
living
abroad.
i'm
really
trying
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
emphasize
this
the
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
would've
statute
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
elg
originated
mr.
davis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
that
is
the
last
thing
that
you
read
that
would
cut
out
declaratory
judgment
all
together,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
habeas
corpus?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
would
also
cut
out
any
argument
to
be
derived
from
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
special
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
way
it
would
cut
but
if
you
are
right
and
he
asked
to
come
here,
he
would
subject
himself
would
he
not,
from
jurisdiction?
in
regard
to
any
outstanding
indictment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
you
bring
him
within
what
justice
holmes
said
in
ju
toy
that
he
is
not
really
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
physically
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
that
i
don't
have
to
decide
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
this
moment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
the
section
isn't
the
purpose
scheme
isn't
all
inclusive,
you
mean
there
are
practical
difficulties
in
applying
it
but
is
it
statutorily
–
is
the
government
wrong
in
saying
that
statutorily
from
its
point
of
view
to
all
the
inclusive
in
the
sense
that
there
are
specific
other
statutory
provisions
dealing
with
this
subject
which
govern
outside
of
this
scheme?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that,
if
that's
what
you
say.
this
doesn't
displace
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
what
i
wonder,
is
there
any
provision
--
is
there
any
other
existing
law,
statutory
material
that
deals
with
this
subject
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
against
the
justice
you
make
if
the
hardships
involved
in
making
this
all
inclusive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
upshot
of
which
was
the
argument
that
this
difficulties
that
you
suggest
are
difficulties
in
operation
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
which
you
draw
the
inference
presumably
congress
didn't
mean
to
cover
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
because
the
housewife
couldn't
come
here
without
disrupting
a
family.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
the
soldier
who
couldn't
physically
come
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
no
other
specific
statute
except
the
declaratory
judgment
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
just
want
to
understand
what
you
are
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
argument
with
the
certificate
of
identity
is,
it
is
we
see
section
--
if
that
institution
we
see
section
360?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
administrative
device
or
whatever
you
call
it,
that
mode
of
identification
of
starting
some
action
was
intended
by
this
52
act,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
take
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
time;
you
have
such
a
short
time
for
the
merits.
but,
just
state
with
the
argument,
just
tell
me
whether
the
declaratory
judgment
remedy
derives
from
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
what
this
court
has
construed
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
its
foundation
but
does
the
--
its
application
to
this
type
of
case,
the
deportation
of
passport
cases,
is
that
derived
from
the
generality
of
the
statute
or
why
wouldn't
ju
toy
apply,
that
you
must
first
have
an
administrative
determination
if
you
don't
rely
on
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
the
declaratory
judgment
act
undue
the
reasoning
underlying
ju
toy
that
when
you
deal
with
these
problems,
you
must
first
go
to
the
administrative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
we
have
argued
here
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
think
it
--
if
we
decide,
is
there
any
decision
of
this
court,
just
inform
me,
in
which
we
held,
result
to
declaratory
judgment
cases
in
matters
that
involved
issues
that
bring
into
play
factual
determination
by
administrative
authority
like
immigration
and
nationalization
service
the
right
from
the
declaratory
judgment
act
of
34
and
eliminates
all
that
preceded
into
that
to
immigration
and
nationalization
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
claimed
to
be
the
citizen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
--
but
have
i
been
taking
much
time
but
this
you
know
legislation
wasn't
any
--
my
point
about
elg
was,
of
course,
one
remembers
was
that
you
didn't
have
all
these
legislation
at
the
time,
available.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
apa
makes
an
exception
as
to
special
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'll
be
denying
of
this,
you
make
–-
as
i
understood
your
answer,
to
justice
--
subject
earlier,
you
say,
you
could
go
either
under
360
or
the
declaratory
judgment,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
it's
adequate
but
it
certainly
is
a
special
statutory
recollection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
rather
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
more
than
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
it
is,
if
--
you
can't
invoke
the
administrative
procedure
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
if
it
is
irrelevant
for
me
than
the
special
procedure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
360
says,
it
denied
or
by
any
department
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
any
department,
is
that
the
difference
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
the
suit
is
against
the
attorney
general
or
secretary
of
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wasn't
raised
by
the
cabinet
committee
because
the
evil
hasn't
disclosed
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
1865
down
to
1940
allowed
a
weakling
of
memory,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
another
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
deals
with
the
existence
of
a
specific
act.
when
it
is
inadequate,
it
doesn't
follow
because
the
procedural
provision
normally
added
is
to
be
restricted
in
its
meaning
because
in
a
particular
class
of
cases
as
an
inadequate
(inaudible),
then
it
could
be
taken
care
of
by
declaratory
judgment.
