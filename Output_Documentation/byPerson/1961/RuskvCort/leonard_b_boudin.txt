mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
approaching
first
the
procedural
jurisdictional
issue,
i
put
in
the
following
way
whether
this
citizen
contest
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
deny
him
a
passport
on
the
ground
that
he
has
lost
his
nationality
under
349(a)(10),
whether
the
test
can
be
made
under
the
standard
procedure
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
the
district
of
columbia
code
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
whether
the
citizen
claimed
must
attempt
to
enter
the
united
states
and
emphasize
the
word
“attempt”,
as
your
honors
will
see.
under
procedures
relating
to
aliens
and
litigate
the
issue
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
with
whatever
question
of
this
stand
as
a
proof
there
maybe
against
the
attorney
general
instead
of
in
the
proceeding
against
the
secretary
of
state.
now
in
approaching
this
problem,
i
think
we
must
face
first
the
question
of
how
the
appellee,
dr.
cort
was
injured
as
the
court
below
held
he
was
and
by
whom,
what
relief
he
sought
and
from
whom,
all
of
which
have
a
bearing
on
both
constitutional
right,
construction
in
the
statutes
there
involved.
this
lawsuit
was
not
instituted
because
the
man
wanted
to
enter
the
united
states
or
because
he
had
a
controversy,
a
real
controversy
with
the
attorney
general.
it
was
issued
because
a
man
was
denied
a
passport
by
the
secretary
of
state
who,
under
section
211
(a)
of
22
u.s.
code,
is
the
only
person
who
can
give
a
passport
and
who
is
directed
not
to
give
passports
under
212
of
22
u.s.
code
if
the
person
is
not
a
national
or
one
having
allegiance
or
is
not
a
citizen.
and
the
secretary
of
state
acted
here
under
a
power
given
to
him
by
congress
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
section
104
(a),
the
power
to
make
determination
with
respect
to
nationality
of
persons
who
were
abroad.
the
only
person
who
has
given
that
statutory
power
under
the
immigration
act,
hence,
this
suit
against
the
secretary
of
state
not
for
entrance,
not
for
certificate
of
identity
but
for
a
passport
and
of
necessity
and
injunction
declaring
the
particular
statute
unconstitutional
which
was
the
basis
for
the
denial
of
the
passport.
now,
we
have
a
suit
here
under
three
statutes
and
the
statutes
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
they
are
the
ones
which
i
have
mentioned
before
and
on
their
face,
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
absent
the
dispute
which
we
have
here
over
the
meaning
of
360,
the
appellee
has
a
--has
jurisdiction
--
the
court
below
had
jurisdiction.
and
i
may
say
in
analyzing
this
entire
problem,
i
am
bearing
in
mind
the
observation
that
had
been
made
by
at
least
one
member
of
this
court
presently
and
by
mr.
justice
holmes
that
we
are
concerned
with
the
mischief.
the
mischief
that
congress
wanted
to
repair
when
it
passed
360
and
that
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
vicissitudes
of
legislation
and
we
must
not
look
into
the
motives
of
legislators
certainly
not
unless
there
is
a
formal
expression
of
the
motive.
i
think
that
all
these
grounds
we
shall
be
able
to
prove
that
our
construction
of
the
statute
is
correct.
i
may
say
that
while
the
government
begins
by
suggesting
that
503
in
1940
was
necessary
for
declaratory
judgment
act
--
action
and
your
honors
will
recall
that
related
to
a
declaratory
judgment
action
for
man
that
was
here
is
one
--
is
one
who
is
abroad.
perkins
against
elg
then
decided
by
this
court
one
year
earlier
in
1939
and
therefore,
section
503
would
not
necessary
to
give
the
declaratory
judgment
action
which
the
government
suggested.
but
i
want
to
change
to
what
we
must
all
do
as
we
have
been
advised
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
by
others
turned
to
the
face
of
the
statute
before
we
consider
legislative
history
or
arguments
of
counsel
or
arguments
of
proponents
will
always
in
asking
for
legislation
see
the
worst
as
well
as
of
their
opponent.
always
therefore,
dangerous
taken
what
one
said
recounted
for
a
legislative
committee
as
a
determining
factor
in
the
construction
of
legislation.
on
its
face,
360
deals
exclusively
with
entry
and
it
does
not
prohibit
suit
for
declaratory
judgment.
we
take
issue,
we
are
glad
that
the
government
has
posed
the
issues
as
squarely
with
the
statement
in
its
reply
brief
at
page
3,
that
360
expressly
covers
the
entire
universe
of
citizenship
claimants
because
the
government
is
clearly
in
error
on
that
point.
it
expressly
does
not
cover
those
persons
who
are
over
the
age
of
16
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
who
has
never
been
in
this
country
before.
it
necessarily,
as
a
practical
matter,
does
not
cover
those
persons
who,
like
the
amicus
curiae
and
mrs.
schneider
are
not
able
to
leave
and
breakaway
from
their
families
and
come
here
to
litigate
matters
that
may
take
two
or
three
years
or
more
in
habeas
corpus
and
we
have
seen
how
the
mendoza
case,
which
is
not
a
habeas
corpus
had
been
here
for
so
many
years,
who
cannot
afford
the
financial
cost
of
travelling
to
the
united
states
to
litigate
the
matter,
who
may
be
in
military
service
even
in
united
states
army
or
who
may
be
ill
or
who
may
not
want
to
leave
their
families.
it
does
not
cover
the
practical
matter
for
all
these
categories.
now
therefore,
and
it
certainly
doesn't
cover
the
category
of
persons
who
happen
to
be
abroad
and
who
for
example,
merely
want
a
passport
to
travel
from
england
to
spain,
as
was
the
case
of
donald
douglas
stewart,
the
motion
picture
writer
who
sued
for
a
passport
some
years
ago
and
secured
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
without
ever
coming
to
this
country.
now
we
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
government,
yes.
well,
this
is
a
question
we'll
be
placing
our
argument
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
as
against
360
(voice
overlap)
the
government
is
wrong
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
but
i
would've
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no
your
honor
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
have
--
first
of
all,
there
are
no
statutes
other
than
the
three
upon
which
i
rely,
the
declaratory
judgment
act
of
34
and
the
a.p.
and
so
forth.
secondly,
our
argument
is
not
that
this
is
a
hardship
statute.
our
argument
is
that
congress
necessarily
could
not
have
intended
to
make
this
exclusive
because
it
left
out
a
whole
category
of
people
from
the
age
of
16
to
100
who
maybe
living
abroad
and
who
have
never
been
in
this
country
(voice
overlap)
and
why
citizens
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
of
the
difficulties
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
they
are
more
than
difficulties
in
operation.
they
leave
out
a
large
group
which
means
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
mean
that
this
statute
is
the
only
way
to
test
nationality
–
it's
more
than
operation.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
may
have
blurred
the
picture
by
indicating
the
housewife
who
couldn't
come
here,
not
disrupting
a
family
without
leaving
her
children.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
but
let
us
take
the
case
of
the
person
who
is
over
16,
who
is
not
a
housewife
or
a
soldier,
he
cannot
sue.
he
is
left
out
of
the
statute
because
the
statute
section
360
is
limited
to
people
who
are
under
16
and
born
abroad
of
american
parents
or
people
who
have
been
in
this
country
before.
the
american
citizen
born
abroad
with
age
18
or
age
80
cannot
sue
under
the
statute
if
he
has
not
previously
been
here
and
that
is
what
i
mean
by
saying
that
there
is
a
category
of
persons
whom
congress
did
not
give
the
right
to
enter
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
and
the
idea.
your
honor
is
quite
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now
in
analyzing
the
legislative
history
here,
i
want
to
point
out
if
your
honors
will
read
the
hearings
on
section
503,
the
nationality
act
at
1940.
your
honors
will
see
that
the
issue
posed
there
by
a
proponent
of
the
bill,
a
very
able
immigration
lawyer
always
was
how
to
get
people
into
this
country.
and
the
government
responds,
the
response
of
mr.
flournoy,
as
your
honors
know,
was
an
expert
in
the
field
of
nationality
was
well
the
only
--
we
think
that
they
have
a
right
to
declaratory
judgment
act
and
the
answer
of
mr.
--
actually
and
the
answer
mr.
shoemaker
the
deputy
commissioner
of
immigration
was,
“yes,
but
if
they
come
here,
how
will
we
get
them
out?”.
that
was
the
problem,
mr.
butler
the
proponent
of
this
thing,
the
late
proponent
was
apparently
under
the
impression
and
sometimes
it
is
true
that
it
is
better
for
a
man
to
be
physically
in
a
country
where
he
can
testify
instead
of
doing
it
by
deposition
from
abroad
or
by
affidavit
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
he
wanted
the
people
physically
here
and
that
was
the
only
point
of
section
503.
now,
when
we
come
to
this
problem
which
is
really
before
your
honor
which
is
section
360,
let
us
examine
the
legislative
history
referred
to
by
the
government
to
see
whether
it
supports
its
argument
that
the
purpose
of
360
was
to
reduce
litigation,
clothing
with
the
expression
used
by
mr.
davis.
i
have
read
the
entire
legislative
history
of
course
as
has
mr.
davis
of
this
particular
statute
360.
there
is
not
a
word
presented
to
the
congress
that
i
have
been
able
to
find,
which
suggests
that
congress
was
worried
about
the
number
of
lawsuits.
this
is
unfortunately
--
a
fortunate
–
fortunately,
a
litigating
country
and
very
rarely
do
we
worry
about
the
number
of
lawsuits
or
their
exception.
this
was
a
case
where
congress
was
concerned
about
one
thing,
were
these
chinese,
these
1288
as
referred
to
by
mr.
davis,
were
they
getting
in
here
and
then
that
is
mr.
erin's
counsel
for
the
immigration
committee
said,
“getting
lost.
how
are
we
going
to
get
them
out
if
they
aren't
really
citizens?”
and
so
congress
determined
that
if
a
man
wanted
to
come
here,
he
was
going
to
come
here
on
the
pretty
rigid
control
of
the
immigration
service
as
the
explanation
for
a
deputy
attorney
general
peyton
ford's
remarks,
“not
that
congress
wanted
to
prevent
the
man
from
starting
a
lawsuit”,
because
right
through
this
whole
history,
while
it's
true
there
are
a
lot
of
lawsuits,
nobody
complained
to
the
congress
that
it
was
the
number
of
lawsuits
that
was
the
problem
rather
than
that
of
entry
and
as
pure
speculation
for
the
government
to
say,
“well,
there
are
few
cases
in
which
the
courts
on
the
west
coast
has
said
there
have
been
a
large
number
of
false
identity
cases”.
and
then
to
say
that's
the
reason
it
was
in
the
minds
of
congress
when
the
committee
reports
and
at
testimony
before
the
committee
does
not
say
so.
now
your
honors
will
see
from
the
very
able
amicus
curiae
brief
filed
here
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
which
i
also
am
indebted,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
said,
as
the
expert
on
these
problem
immigrants,
repeatedly
said.
“we
got
to
prevent
this
entry
of
people”.
it
never
said
anything
about
a
lawsuit.
and
the
government's
brief
in
brownell
against
shung,
itself
contains
before
this
problem
was
highlighted,
the
following
statement,
“section
360
of
the
1952
act
provides
that,
persons
claiming
citizenship,
even
persons
claiming
citizenship
who
are
excluded
on
the
ground
that
citizenship
is
not
established,
may
have
the
determination
reviewed
by
habeas
corpus”.
it
didn't
say
people
who
are
claiming
citizenship
had
to
go
through
habeas
corpus,
it
was
the
excluded
proof.
and
mr.
justice
clark,
in
his
opinion
--
in
his
opinion
in
the
we
shung
case
which
is
a
dictum
on
this
point
i
think,
discussed
section
360
and
said,
“citizen
claimants
who
hold
certificates
of
identity”,
as
the
group
who
wanted
to
come
here,
“are
required
by
360
(c)
to
test
the
validity
of
their
exclusion
by
habeas
corpus
only”.
respondent
here
said
mr.
justice
clark,
he
was
an
alien,
but
neither
claim
citizenship
nor
that
he
hold
a
certificate
of
identity
and
therefore,
360
has
no
bearing
here.
and
dr.
cort,
the
appellee
here
has
no
certificate
of
identity
and
equally
has
no
bearing
because
he
has
not
been
excluded
because
he
hadn't
sought
entry.
now,
while
we
are
going
on
in
discussing
360,
may
i
say
that
the
government
has
overlooked
a
parallel
operation
of
great
significance
with
going
on
here
in
the
congress.
and
again,
i'm
indebted
to
mr.
david
carliner
who
wrote
the
american
civil
liberties
union
brief
because
he
points
out
at
pages
11
through
18
of
his
brief
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
were
attempting
during
this
entire
periods
from
the
80th
congress
to
the
82nd
in
two
ways,
to
take
nationality
matters
out
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
to
allow
these
matters
to
be
determined
only
by
habeas
corpus.
your
honors
will
see
that
the
first
method
is
by
a
direct
amendment
to
the
administrator
procedure
act
to
say
as
one
bill
said
that
the
functions
or
proceedings
authorized
under
these
acts
are
limited
to
habeas
corpus
and
that
failed
and
i
will
not
take
the
court's
time
to
indicate
the
various
bills
that
ultimately
failed.
the
second
method
and
even
more
significant
is
the
attempt
to
create
a
new
immigration
law
which
eventually
became
the
1952
act
and
to
provide
in
that
law
that
the
apa
was
not
to
apply.
and
here,
we
have
the
famous
section
106
which
appears
in
mr.
carliner's
brief
at
page
13
in
the
footnote
and
i
--
because
that
provides
specifically
that
in
all
of
these
nationality
and
immigration
matters,
a
13
and
14
footnote,
habeas
corpus
was
to
be
the
method
to
be
determining
these
problems
and
the
immigration
service
pointed
that
out
repeatedly
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief.
but
congressman
walter
and
senator
mccarran,
the
orphans
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
would
not
accept
section
106
and
they
are
set
forth
in
mr.
carliner's
brief
and
in
my
brief.
his
brief
at
pages
17
and
18,
a
very
significant
statement
made
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
by
its
illumination
said
the
service,
on
section
106,
“the
orphans
of
this
bill
have
necessarily
calls
the
situation
to
continue
whereby
decisions
of
the
service
can
be
reviewed
not
only
by
habeas
corpus”,
the
government
says
here,
“but
also
under
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
that
basic
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
and
the
declaratory
judgment
action
under
360”,
all
three,
this
was
the
view
of
the
ins.
now,
after
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
failed
to
put
over
its
position,
the
bill
was
passed
by
the
congress
with
remarks
on
the
importance
of
the
application
of
the
apa
and
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
we
shung
case,
speaking
for
unanimous
court
and
mr.
justice
black
in
the
pedreiro
case,
both
pointed
to
the
remarks
of
senator
mccarran
and
congressman
walter
as
emphasizing
the
fact
that
the
apa
was
going
to
apply,
despite
the
passage
of
the
subsequent
legislation
of
the
immigration
act,
and
in
pedreiro,
despite
the
fact
that
habeas
corpus
had
only
previously
been
held
in
(inaudible)
to
be
the
message
intended
by
congress
in
the
statute,
the
1917
immigration
law
to
determine
deportation
matters,
apa
section
12
would
help
with
the
conclusion
and
to
require
that
it
be
applied
in
cases
of
deportation
and
in
pedreiro,
this
court
held
the
same
with
respect
to
exclusion
proceedings.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
please
sir.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
they're
--
i'm
quite
sure
your
honor.
and
my
only
question
was
whether
it
preceded
(inaudible)
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
recall
whether
finance
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
(inaudible)
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
it
definitely
would
not
your
honor.
now,
i
--
point
your
honors
i
make
the
point,
what
the
government
said
in
the
we
shung
case
in
its
brief,
“as
is
in
the
highest
degree
unlikely
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
one
conceitedly
an
alien
seeking
admission
a
greater
writer
review
than
was
made
available
to
persons
claiming
american
citizenship”.
and
yet
the
effect
of
the
government's
position
here
would
mean
the
we
shung
and
pedreiro,
admitted
aliens,
have
to
--
can
start
a
declaratory
judgment
action
and
we
admittedly
one
said
at
least
we
think
presently,
an
american
citizen
have
to
go
through
what
mr.
justice
clark
pointed
out
as
significant
here
the
odium
of
arrest
and
detention.
and
i
pass
over
just
for
the
moment,
we'll
cover
if
there's
time
the
--
what
happens
to
a
man
when
he
comes
in
as
an
alien?
and
the
amount
of
surveillance
that
is
committed
and
the
control
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
dr.
cort
would
ever
be
relieved
from
actual
arrest
if
he
came
here
not
because
of
the
indictment
alone
but
because
having
one
stead
prior
to
1951,
remember
the
communist
party.
his
question
is
to
whether
he
is
not
an
excludable
alien
and
therefore
not
admitted
at
all
under
the
alien
act.
now,
the
government
says
that
360
set
out
what
it
called
the
special
statutory
review
proceeding
relevant
to
the
subject
matter
and
adequately
to
the
meaning
of
section
10
of
the
apa
and
therefore
the
apa
doesn't
apply.
to
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
please.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
your
honor.
declaratory
remedy
derives
from
the
declaratory
judgment
act
of
1934.
it
is
independent
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
of
course
declaratory
judgment
act
was
passed
in
1934,
the
ju
toy
was
long
before
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
ju
toy
did
not
say
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i'll
answer
you.
i
think
your
honor
was
on
the
court
in
perkins
against
elg.
perkins
against
elg
was
exactly
that
problem.
mrs.
elg
was
involved
in
the
deportation
matter,
was
withheld
pending
the
suit
for
declaratory
judgment.
this
court
held
that
a
declaratory
judgment
act
would
lie
under
the
34
act.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
she
--
so
do
we
here,
claim
to
be
a
citizen,
exactly.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we're
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
this
held.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
and
the
question
what
this
legislation
means
whether
360,
you
didn't
have
one
thing
we
now
have,
which
is
the
apa
so
that
we
have
an
advantage
over
ms.
elg.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now
that's
exactly
what
i'm
coming
down
to
on
whether
or
not
this
is
a
specialized
statutory
procedure.
and
also
whether
or
not
it
is
relevant
to
the
subject
matter
that
as
the
requirement
in
10
(a)
and
whether
or
not
it
is
adequate
but
that's
all
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
of
course,
but
this
is
--
that
doesn't
mean
the
360
is
adequate
and
not
onerous.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
the
question
is
whether
the
special
statutory
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
10
(a)
and
let
me
address
myself
to
that.
first
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
i
think
it
is
relevant.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
yes
we
can
your
honor
unless
the
special
statutory
where
will
be
stating
is
relevant
to
the
subject
matter
and
that
is
exactly
what
i
want
to
point
out
your
honor
why
it's
not
and
unless
it's
adequate.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
that's
a
different
thing.
i
won't
address
myself
to
that
problem.
we
say
it
is
not
a
special
statutory
proceeding
relevant
to
the
subject
matter
because
section
360
deals
with
the
subject
of
entry
and
they
dispute
with
the
attorney
general
about
the
right
to
enter.
and
because
our
dispute,
unless
it
were
a
contrived
one
which
this
is
court
had
disapproved
of
in
the
past
as
history
indicates,
is
not
with
the
attorney
general.
the
subject
matter
of
this
lawsuit
as
a
passport
denied
by
the
secretary
of
state,
not
exclusion
imposed
by
the
attorney
general
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
really
did
in
perkins
against
elg,
when
it
granted
ms.
elg's
cross-petition
to
certiorari
because
she
was
not
satisfied
with
the
release
she
had
against
the
commission
of
labor,
a
secretary
of
labor
who
then
had
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
over
immigration.
she
wanted
a
passport
and
this
court
reversed
the
court
below
and
directed
that
an
injunction
issue
against
the
secretary
of
state
in
her
suit
for
passport.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
but
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
but
then
we
come
down
to
the
question
of
adequacy,
is
it
an
adequate
remedy
in
this
situation
and
in
many
others
that
i
could
indicate
if
we
had
time,
to
require
a
person
situated
as
dr.
cort
to
come
here
as
an
alien
subject
to
all
of
the
procedures
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
affecting
aliens
subject
to
detention,
possibly
to
be
held
without
bail?
and
is
it
adequate
to
require
him
to
do
that?
but
even
before
we
come
to
that
question
of
adequacy,
let
me
show
your
honors
what
would
really
happen
if
the
government
is
right,
we
would
have
to
ask
the
secretary
of
state
first
for
a
certificate
of
identity.
if
the
secretary
of
state
refuse
to
give
it,
some
courts
have
held
that
he
cannot
be
sued
so
we
could
never
get
here.
some
courts
have
held
that
he
can
be
sued
but
that
the
order
which
denies
--
which
denies
a
relief
in
interlocutory
order
and
can't
be
appealed.
suppose,
however,
we
prevail
in
lawsuit
number
one
against
secretary
of
state,
then
we
arrive
here
and
the
attorney
general
takes
us
into
custody
then
we
move
for
the
year
or
two
into
litigation
on
habeas
corpus.
and
finally,
it
is
held
if
the
attorney
general
takes
the
position
that
we're
excluded,
it
is
held
by
the
courts,
let
us
say,
that
dr.
cort
is
a
citizen
and
not
excludable.
this
does
not
compel
the
secretary
of
state
to
give
him
a
passport.
oh,
he
may
as
a
matter
of
fair
play,
but
we
heard
yesterday
of
government
agencies,
(inaudible)
all
citizens
are
bound
by
the
decisions
of
the
courts.
but
what
if
the
attorney
general
allows
dr.
cort
after
administrative
hearing
to
come
in
--
in
here
agreeing
with
our
contention
that
dr.
cort
had
not
lost
his
citizenship,
then
what
would
happen?
we
would
have
had
two
lawsuits,
secretary
of
state
identity
one,
attorney
general
administrative
one
but
what
would've
prevail
there
without
going
to
court?
and
then
the
secretary
of
state
will
say,
“well
i
made
a
determination
that
dr.
cort
is
not
a
citizen.
i'm
not
going
to
agree
with
the
attorney
general.
the
one
who
makes
the
determinations
under
104
of
the
immigration
act.
you
have
to
sue
me”.
so
we
have
three
lawsuits
here
certainly
not
an
adequate
remedy
for
a
man
who
merely
wants
a
passport
and
a
declaration
of
citizenship.
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
frank
against
rogers
which
agrees
with
us
on
this
point
and
other
courts
had
made
this
point
that
will
require
several
lawsuits
and
therefore
the
remedy
is
not
adequate.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
consistently,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
other
as
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
sorry.
the
others
as
we
indicated
in
the
large
footnote
to
our
brief,
had
not
really
had
this
problem
because
the
suit,
the
360
problem
really
only
arose
in
a
suit
--
in
a
suit
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time
at
the
moment
to
question
into
the
statutory
now,
but
the
only
case
is
that
really
have
a
bearing
are
those
in
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
we
say
therefore
that
there
is
no
universality
here
and
that
what
we
--
what
the
government
is
trying
to
make
us
have
is
they
can
try
dispute
with
the
attorney
general
when
we
only
have
a
dispute
with
the
secretary
of
state.
and
that
even
if
these
were
a
special
statutory
remedy,
it
is
by
no
means
the
proper
one
because
it
is
inadequate
and
it
doesn't
touch
on
the
subject
matter
of
our
dispute.
now
briefly
turning
to
the
substantive
issue
in
this
case,
i
point
out
that
this
court
dealt
with
a
desertion
in
12
that
four
justices,
the
remark
was
made
early
this
morning
that
it
was
four
or
five
justices
held
that
it
was
punishment.
and
four
of
the
justices
held
that
the
desertion
provision
that
is,
expatriation
for
desertion.
desertion
provision
was
barred
by
the
eight
amendment
whereas
one
justice,
mr.
justice
brennan
held
that
it
was
not
barred
by
the
eight
amendment
but
by
the
fifth
amendment
because
he
regarded,
there
being
an
unreasonable
(inaudible)
connection
between
the
punishment
and
the
war
power.
now,
these
considerations
and
more
which
i
will
touch
upon
briefly
led
the
court
to
the
conclusion,
to
that
conclusion
are
present
in
this
case
because
the
draft
delinquency
provision
and
the
desertion
provision
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
and
of
course
the
chief
justice
in
the
principle
opinion
in
trop,
they
both
have
a
common
origin
and
purpose.
indeed
there
in
the
same
sentence,
if
we
disregard
a
semicolon
of
the
same
section
21
of
the
act
of
1865.
it
really
would
require,
i
think,
a
reversal
of
a
great
deal
in
trop
to
come
to
a
different
conclusion
here.
but
there
are
additional
factors
which
because
of
time
i
will
merely
touch
upon
which
would
lead
the
court,
i
hope
even
those
members
of
the
court
who
did
not
participate
in
the
majority
decision
here
because
they
were
the
minority
or
because
they
weren't
on
the
bench,
to
say
that
in
this
case,
the
application
of
this
statute
there
is
a
violation
of
due
process.
first,
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
is
an
offense,
a
lower
serious
offense,
less
serious
from
the
violation
in
trop,
it
is
punishable
by
death.
this
is
of
course
five
years
and
one
case
as
mr.
davis'
counsel
argued
this
morning
pointed
out,
there
was
a
very
serious
violation
of
a
duty
once
a
man
is
a
soldier.
secondly,
this
is
under
a
statute
providing
for
a
loss
of
citizenship
without
judicial
trial
or
court-martial
and
this
point
that
was
made
by
the
chief
justice
in
trop
in
commenting
in
passing
and
as
a
point
that
was
made
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
trop
dissent,
when
he
referred
there
to
a
conviction
duly
resulting
from
a
proceeding
conducted
in
accordance
with
all
of
the
relevant
constitutional
safeguards.
thirdly,
this
statute
doesn't
even
name
the
tribunal,
court-martial
or
otherwise,
that
is
ultimately
to
make
the
determination
which
was
made
by
the
secretary
of
state.
fourthly,
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
the
statutory
presumption
which
we
think
was
implicit
in
the
board's
decision
below
and
even
in
the
courts
although
it
wasn't
mentioned
and
say
that
--
that
is
an
unreasonable
presumption.
and
finally,
we
point
out
that
the
result
in
this
case
is
statelessness.
now,
we
agree
with
counsel,
mr.
davis,
who
argue
this
morning
that
the
fact
that
he
has
a
client
who
were
to
do
a
masteral
doesn't
mean
that
he
isn't
being
punished
within
the
meaning
of
the
eighth
or
the
fifth
amendment
as
you
consider
it
here
because
he
still
reflected
mexican
nationality.
and
we
are
not
suggesting
there
should
be
a
differentiation
between
the
two
cases.
we
are
saying
that
here,
the
court
is
squarely
faced
for
the
first
time
with
the
statelessness
issue
and
that
it
must
take
it
into
consideration
determining
the
reasonableness
of
the
punishment,
point
made
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
trop.
how
reasonable
is
it
to
impose
not
only
alienage
but
statelessness
in
a
world
in
which
everyone
knows
or
require
no
oration
by
me,
indicate
a
significance
from
the
point
of
view
of
national
life,
state
and
federal
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
international
life
where
you're
left
without
the
protection
of
your
country.
and
it
was
in,
i
think,
nishikawa
that
mr.
justice
harlan
commented
on
the
fact
that
in
nishikawa,
they
were
dealing
with
the
man
who
was
merely
turning
back
to
his
other
nationality.
now,
i
turn
you
for
a
moment
to
the
impact
at
first
which
mr.
davis
has
relied
upon
although
we
rely
upon
and
they
say
the
views
expressed
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
as
a
principle
laid
down
in
perez.
it
is
perez'
dissenting
memorandum
when
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
possible
embarrassment
to
our
foreign
relations
and
so
to
here.
but
if
we
take
the
majority
opinion
in
perez,
that
it's
predicated
upon
a
statement
that
the
people
or
government
of
a
foreign
country
may
regard
the
action
in
so
--
the
action
in
perez
to
be
the
action
of
his
government.
this
was
voting,
your
honors
will
recall
or
at
least
as
a
reflection,
if
not
an
expression,
of
its
policy.
now,
surely
nobody
will
suggest
that
the
man
who
remains
abroad
to
avoid
his
draft
obligation
is
speaking
for
the
united
states
of
america
or
reflecting
the
policy
of
united
states
and
therefore
we
don't
have
that
particular
problem.
i
may
also
say
that
this
developed
foreign
relations
argument
which
we
have
here,
was
not
made
by
the
government's
very
thoughtful
counsel.
i
think
the
same
in
gonzales
against
landon
where
they
have
the
same
legislative
history
to
rely
upon,
the
same
consideration
of
policy
and
yet
the
foreign
policy
consideration
was
mentioned
in
a
word
possibly
in
passing.
none
of
the
highly
developed,
what
i
think
as
afterthought
here
attempt
to
ascribe
to
congress,
a
worry
about
foreign
relations.
now,
the
point
is
made
by
mr.
davis
that
there
was
flight
from
this
country
passing
over
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
flight
when
in
this
case
considered
there
wasn't
flight
but
remaining
abroad.
but
let
me
point
out
that
congress
never
intended
the
flight
or
remaining
abroad
problem
to
be
the
consideration
here
because
the
1865
statute
referred
to
not
only
leaving
the
country
but
leaving
the
district
of
your
draft
board,
hardly
proof
of
the
concern
for
foreign
relations
in
moving
from
new
york
to
philadelphia.
secondly,
the
present
statute
is
phrased
in
terms
of
leaving
the
united
states
to
remaining
abroad,
not
entering
a
foreign
country.
i
think
that's
not
a
critical
point
but
in
some
indication
that
congress
in
not
using
the
words
“remaining
in
a
foreign
country”
or
going
to
a
foreign
country
wasn't
thinking
of
the
foreign
relations
problem.
there
is
absolutely
no
legislative
history
to
show
a
concern
with
foreign
relations.
in
the
1865
statute
which
the
government
has
several
times
said
in
gonzales,
in
perez,
in
nishikawa,
was
an
omnibus
military
statute
--
military
measure,
there
is
no
indication
that
when
the
statute
came
forward
again
in
1878,
the
revised
statute,
in
1912
that
--
or
in
1944
that
there
was
a
concern
for
foreign
relation.
all
of
this
is
very
skillful,
very
able
theoretical
analysis
by
counsels
such
as
we
always
engage
in
of
course
but
is
not
the
reflection
of
the
view
of
congress.
and
indeed,
why
did
not,
if
this
was
a
foreign
relations
problem,
the
cabinet
committee
of
1938
include
draft
evasion
with
delinquency
--
with
desertion?
there
was
the
secretary
of
state
sitting
on
the
cabinet
committee.
it
was
not
until
1944
that
we
had
the
problem
raised
by
the
attorney
general,
the
chief
enforcement
officer
of
the
government
and
this
is
dealt
with
in
the
brief
but
in
emphasizing
the
fact
that
this
was
an
intention
to
punish
people
for
avoiding
their
obligation.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
the
evil
had
a
chance
to
disclose
itself
from
1865
on
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
if
there
was
an
evil.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
but
--
no.
but
there
is
nothing
if
--
assuming
there
are
weakling
of
memory
your
honor,
i
think
the
counsel
was
able
enough
to
find
evidence
of
congressional
concern
if
that
has
existed
between
1865
and
1944
concern
over
foreign
relations
so
i'm
talking
about
it.
but
let
me
just
address
myself
for
a
moment
to
the
question
of
sovereignty,
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states.
i
will
not
repeat
what
mr.
davis
said
this
morning
and
the
obligations
of
a
citizen.
of
course
the
man
who
remains
abroad
to
avoid
the
draft
is
violating
a
cardinal
attribute
of
citizenship
--
of
responsibility
of
the
citizen.
and
so
is
the
person
who
violates
the
tax
laws
and
so
is
the
person
who
is
otherwise
delinquent
in
his
duties
to
the
government
including
the
man
who
has
served,
let
us
say,
in
the
government
and
who
has
betrayed
the
public
trust
and
so
is
the
person
who,
this
court
said
in
blackmer
against
the
united
states
violated
his
duty
of
citizenship
when
he
didn't
return
to
the
united
states
to
testify
pursuant
to
the
subpoena
in
(inaudible).
all
of
these
are
very
important
obligations
of
citizenship,
that
isn't
the
point.
the
question
is
whether
they
can
be
punished
by
carrying
one
out
of
the
body
politic
and
saying,
“you
are
not
a
citizen
anymore,
you
are
stateless
here”.
i
grant
you
that
these
are
important
obligations
of
citizenship
but
that
doesn't
determine
the
problem.
i
know
that
judge
(inaudible)
a
very
able
judge
in
all
southern
district
in
new
york
very
often
said
that
he
will
impose
a
very
serious
punishment
for
the
tax
evader.
i
heard
him
deliver
address
on
that
once
because
he
said,
“this
is
the
most
serious
offense
that
he
regards,
the
man
who
will
not
support
his
own
country
by
cheating
on
it
when
it
comes
to
taxes”,
and
the
blackmer
thing
is
where
this
court
previously
decided.
this
court
has
never
decided
that
in
the
exercise
of
what
is
called
“sovereignty”,
it
may
take
away
citizenship
from
a
citizen.
in
(inaudible)
mckenzie
against
hare,
it
recognized
the
transfer
by
what
it
regarded
as
the
unilateral
decision
of
the
citizen
to
adopt
another
nationality.
there
was
a
general
discussion
of
sovereignty
but
it
didn't
say
that
in
the
absence
of
this
clear
intention
to
transfer,
there
was
going
to
be
--
it
was
going
to
be
an
exercise
of
sovereignty.
and
neither
in
trop
nor
in
perez
nor
in
any
other
case
thus
far
coming
to
this
court
at
the
very
elaborate
arguments
of
the
government
made
brilliantly
i
may
say
by
mr.
davis
usually,
persuaded
this
court
that
independent
of
foreign
relations,
independent
of
the
war
power
which
connects
this
is
as
just
a
punishment,
there
is
some
vague
sovereign
power
which
allows
the
government
to
say
that
the
citizens
who
theoretically
control
it,
you
are
not
one
of
us
anymore,
get
out,
become
an
alien
or
a
stateless
person.
this
court
has
not
yet
and
i
hope
will
not
in
this
case
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
this
general
doctrine
of
sovereign
power
must
prevail
where,
under
the
foreign
relations
power
and
under
the
war
power,
it
is
impossible
to
sustain
a
continuous
statute.
i
thank
your
honors.
