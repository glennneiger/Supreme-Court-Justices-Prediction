mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
another
case
that
involves,
at
bottom,
the
constitutionality
of
a
provision
of
the
statutes
relating
to
expatriation
for
leaving
the
country
to
avoid
military
service.
the
statute
involved
here
is
not
section
401
(j)
of
the
1940
nationality
act
which
was
involved
in
the
preceding
case
but
section
349
(a)
(10)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
which,
in
respects
pertinent
here
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
earlier
statute.
there
are
three
issues
before
the
court,
one
is
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
because
the
court
did
not
note
probable
jurisdiction
and
reserved
the
question
for
the
hearing
on
the
merits.
the
second
issue,
a
non-constitutional
issue
also,
is
whether
this
action
could
have
been
brought
at
all
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
lower
court.
it
was
brought
as
a
--
under
the
ordinary
declaratory
judgment
act
and
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
question
is
whether
under
the
statutes
which
now
exist
in
the
1952
act,
there
is
not
a
special
exclusive
procedure
under
section
360
of
the
1952
act
which
doctor
cort,
the
appellee
here
was
required
to
follow
and
did
not
seek
to
follow.
and
the
third
question
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
the
expatriation
statute
as
applied
to
the
appellee
here.
first,
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
of
the
court
and
its
rules,
i
address
myself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
the
question
which
was
reserved
in
the
order
on
jurisdiction.
this
was
a
three-judge
court
which
was
convened
because
the
plaintiff
expressly
and
explicitly
sought
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
by
the
secretary
of
state
who
will
refuse
to
passport
to
doctor
cort
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
an
american
national,
sought
to
enjoin
the
secretary
of
state
from
enforcing
the
provisions
of
the
expatriation
statute.
three-judge
court
was
convened,
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
was
indicated
in
the
argument
yesterday
in
the
preceding
case.
congress
had
provided
that
when
any
court
of
the
united
states
holds
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional
there
is
direct
appeal
to
this
court
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1252.
unfortunately,
the
government
did
not,
in
its
notice
of
appeal
or
its
jurisdictional
statement,
refer
to
section
1252
rather
we
refer
to
1253,
which
relates
to
appeal
to
three-judge
courts
but
i
think
that
our
slip
does
not
deprive
the
court
of
jurisdiction
and
the
court
clearly
has
jurisdiction.
we
would
think
also
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
under
the
appeal
from
the
three-judge
court
provision
but
i
won't
take
the
time
of
the
court
due
to
limited
time
for
argument
to
spell
that
out.
i
think
we
do
in
our
brief.
as
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
this
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right
and
that
was
exactly
the
case
in
fleming
against
nestor
which
was
referred
to
yesterday.
the
action
here
is
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief
under
the
ordinary
declaratory
judgment,
the
regular
declaratory
judgment
proceeding.
it
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
doctor
cort
applied
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
a
passport
and
the
passport
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
doctor
cort
was
no
longer
an
american
citizen
and
to
test
--
to
challenge
that
administrative
determination,
this
here
was
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia
against
the
secretary
of
state
to
establish
the
fact
that
dr.
cort
is
an
american
citizen.
the
case
was
decided
in
the
district
court
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment;
there
was
no
oral
testimony
or
no
hearing.
there
were
appended
to
the
respective
motions
for
summary
judgment
affidavits,
documents,
many
documents
and
affidavits
and
--
prior
to
administrative
proceedings
and
the
court
rule
on
the
basis
of
the
summary
judgment
motion.
now,
what
the
district
court,
the
three-judges'
district
court
rule
was
this;
there
were
three
facets
to
its
ruling.
first,
they
said
that
doctor
cort
did
have
the
right
to
pursue
his
ordinary
declaratory
judgment
remedy
that
he
was
not
required
to
follow
the
procedure
of
section
360
of
the
nationality
act,
that's
a
question
i
will
come
to
immediately.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
was
abroad,
that
is
right
sir.
they
held
that
he
did
have
that
right.
secondly,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
held
that
he
had
left
or
remained
abroad
to
evade
the
draft.
they
found
that
under
the
standard
of
clear,
convincing
and
unequivocal
which
this
court
laid
down
in
the
nishikawa
case
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
is
not
open.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
difficulty
i
have
with
that
mr.
justice
brennan
is
this,
the
appellees
do
not
in
their
brief
as
far
as
i
read
it,
raise
that
issue
at
all.
they
would
of
course
be
allowed
to
support
the
judgment
below
on
any
ground.
but
to
support
the
judgment
below,
they
would
have
to
argue
that
the
evidence
or
the
test
--
the
material
before
the
district
court
show
that
dr.
cort
still
remains
an
american
citizen
that
is,
he
did
not
go
abroad
to
evade
the
draft
to
remain
abroad.
they
do
not
make
even
the
slightest
suggestion
of
any
such
crime.
the
most
that
they
suggest
is
that
that
the
testimony
was
vague
and
should
be
re-canvassed
perhaps
at
a
fuller
hearing,
but
they
--
on
that
issue
that
is,
if
they
were
to
take
position
that
the
case
should
go
back
for
a
full
trial
on
the
merits,
i
think
they
have
foreclosed
because
they
did
not
cross-appeal
and
they
would
not
be
supporting
the
judgment
below
if
they
would
urge
upon
this
court
to
remand
for
a
full
trial
on
the
merits,
that
is
that
the
case
should
not
have
been
decided
on
summary
judgment.
so,
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
sir,
no.
the
--
no
effort
was
made
by
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
there
was
--
there
is
--
there
was
no
suggest
--
suggestion
in
the
district
court
as
i
read
the
appellee's
brief
here,
there
is
no
suggestion
of
that
here.
that
was
the
factual
issue
which
was
decided
by
the
trial
court
then
the
court
did
go
on
to
decide
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
they
held
the
statute
invalid.
now,
what
are
the
facts
which
in
our
view
and
in
the
view
of
the
court
--
the
district
court,
this
record
shows,
dr.
cort
was
born
in
boston,
massachusetts
in
early
1920s.
he
went
to
school
there
partially
at
harvard
and
then
he
entered
yale
medical
school
from
which
he
graduated
in
june
1951.
it
maybe
of
some
significance
that
he
had
registered
as
a
regular
selective
service
registrant
and
i
make
this
distinction
because
this
case
involves
a
registration
for
the
doctor's
draft
but
he
had
registered
under
the
ordinary
selective
service
to
which
all
young
man
are
subject
and
he
had
been
deferred
or
rejected
for
physical
reasons
or
for
because
he
was
married
or
because
he
was
a
student
but
he
graduated
yale
in
june
1951
and
he
decided
not
to
take
an
internship
in
this
country
but
to
go
abroad
and
study
at
cambridge
university
in
england
and
do
physiological
research
there.
before
he
left
and
he
left
the
country
at
the
end
of
may
1951,
he
registered
for
the
doctor's
draft
which
is
a
separate,
as
you
--
as
the
court
knows,
is
a
separate
draft
provision
of
the
statute,
he
registered
for
that
and
he
went
abroad
to
england.
while
he
was
in
england,
he
was
classified
under
the
doctor's
draft
in
1
(a)
that
is
available
for
military
service,
that's
in
september
1952
about
13
months
after
he
left
for
england.
apparently,
in
the
fall
of
1952
he
applied
to
the
harvard
medical
school
to
the
department
of
physiology
there
for
a
position
as
an
instructor
in
the
--
in
the
coming
year,
this
is
in
the
fall
of
1952
and
there
is
in
the
record
a
letter
from
dr.
cort
to
professor
landis
of
the
department
of
physiology
at
the
harvard
medical
school
of
december
29th,
1952
in
which
dr.
cort
says
he
is
pleased
to
accept
the
offer
of
appointment
as
a
teacher
at
the
department
of
physiology.
he
has
made
arrangements
to
leave
england
to
come
to
the
united
states
beginning
in,
i
think,
june
or
july
of
1953.
he
would
like
to
start
work
august
1st,
1953
but
he
could
start
earlier
if
they
–
if
the
requirements
demanded.
on
the
same
day
that
he
wrote
to
dr.
landis,
he
wrote
to
the
massachusetts
advisory
committee,
which
is
an
institution
established
under
the
selective
service
law
to
recommend
whether
doctor
s
should
be
deferred
because
they're
essential
to
civilian
life.
and
he
wrote
to
them
saying
that
he
had
accepted
his
position
and
was
going
to
teach
at
harvard
and
that
he
thought
it
would
be
essential
to
civilian
life
that
he
should
be
deferred
from
the
draft,
but
he
was
not
deferred
from
the
draft.
the
harvard
authorities
did
not
recommend
that
he
be
deferred,
the
massachusetts
advisory
committee
recommended
that
he
not
be
deferred
and
he
was
not
deferred
from
the
draft.
and
the
short
of
it
is
and
this
appears
in
the
record
from
documents
really,
the
short
of
it
is,
that
when
dr.
cort,
in
england,discovered
that
he
would
not
be
deferred
from
the
draft
if
he
came
back
to
the
united
states,
he
immediately
cancelled
his
employment
with
harvard
and
stated
that
he
would
remain
abroad.
this
was
in
the
spring
of
1953,
he
did
not
return
to
the
united
states.
he
remained
in
england
until
august
1954
when
i
think,
he
was
under
pressure
perhaps
england
actually
did
expel
him.
he
then
went
to
czechoslovakia
in
august
1954
where
he
has
remained
ever
since.
he
was
indicted,
i
should
say
just
to
complete
the
story
that
he
was
order
--
he
was
ordered
at
various
times
to
report
for
a
physical
examination
by
the
draft
authorities
in
massachusetts.
he
refused
to
do
so
even
though
he
was
allowed
to
proceed
to
have
himself
physically
examined
in
frankfurt,
germany
rather
than
to
come
back
to
the
united
states
if
it
were
more
convenient
for
him
to
do
so.
he
didn't
acknowledge
these
orders
and
he
never
complied
with
them.
he
was
finally
given
a
direct
order
to
appear
for
induction
in
september
1953
which
he
failed
to
do.
he
was
indicted
a
year
later
in
december
1954
and
that
indictment
is
still
pending.
now,
i
should
say
at
once
that
we
make
no
plan
and
we
have
never
made
a
plan
that
dr.
cort
is
going
to
europe,
i
mean
in
may
and
june
of
1951
was
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft,
it
was
not.
he
went
to
take
a
position
at
cambridge
university.
we
do
make
the
claim
that
he
remained
abroad
directly
and
specifically
because
he
did
not
wish
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces.
now,
as
i've
mentioned,
he
remained
in
england
until
august
1954
and
then
he
went
to
czechoslovakia.
and
the
record
contained
some
indication
that
when
he
went
to
czechoslovakia
in
august
1954,
he
apparently
told
the
czechoslovakian
authorities
that
he
was
stateless
at
that
time
because
the
record
indicates
that
he
had
a
permit,
a
residence
permit
in
czechoslovakia
which
indicated
him
as
stateless.
its
equipped
page
87
in
the
record
mr.
justice
and
it's
--
it
appears
from
a
statement
on
his
later
application
for
a
passport.
it's
rather
hard
to
read
on
the
photostat
but
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
you
will
see
there
in
typewritten
form
that
he
has
a
residence
permit
apprentice'
stateless
number
so
and
so
issued
october
22,
1954
by
a
czechoslovakian
authority
which
was
valid
until
october
22,
1959.
now,
dr.
cort
had
a
passport
when
he
went
to
england
which
he
--
which
expired
in
1952
–
52.
he
did
not
seek
to
renew
that
passport
until
1959.
in
april
1959,
he
applied
for
a
renewal
of
his
passport
and
this
was
almost
five
years
after
he
went
to
czechoslovakia.
it
was
denied
by
the
state
department
on
the
ground
that
he
had
expatriated
himself.
there
was
a
review
proceeding
before
the
internal
board
of
review
which
is
established
in
the
state
department,
was
affirmed
by
them
and
by
the
legal
adviser.
now,
i
should
say
because
it's
important
to
the
argument
on
the
--
whether
he
is
following
the
correct
judicial
procedure
that
the
state
department
indicated
to
him
that
he
should
apply
for
a
certificate
of
identity
which
i
will
explain
in
a
few
minutes
under
section
360
of
the
1952
act.
and
that
they
had
--
and
the
state
department
had
instructed
the
embassy
at
prague
to
give
due
consideration
to
his
application
for
a
certificate
of
identity
which
would
enable
him
to
come
to
the
united
states
and
apply
for
admission
to
the
united
states
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
he
had
never
sought
a
certificate
of
identity
rather,
in
march
of
1960
he
brought
this
suit
in
the
district
court.
now,
i
think
i
am
required
by
the
principle,
not
reaching
constitutional
questions
to
discuss
with
the
court
first,
the
procedural
issue
whether
he
has
the
right
to
bring
this
ordinary
declaratory
judgment
action
or
whether
he
should've
preceded
under
section
360
of
the
1952
immigration
and
nationality
act.
now,
at
section
360
is
printed
in
our
brief
at
pages
3
to
5.
it
may
be
helpful
before
i
go
through
and
describe
summarily
the
provisions
of
the
statute
if
i
summarize
the
contentions
of
the
parties.
the
position
of
the
district
court
below
and
of
the
appellee
here
is
that
section
360,
as
a
whole,
is
merely
supplementary
or
additional
to
whatever
other
remedies
may
exist
under
the
regular
declaratory
judgment
act
or
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
the
common
law
or
the
general
jurisdictional
statutes
for
federal
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
that
he
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right,
mr.
justice.
that
is
the
position
of
the
district
court
below
and
of
the
appellees
here.
the
government's
position
on
the
other
hand
is
that,
section
360
is
and
was
intended
by
congress
to
be
an
exclusive,
self-contained
procedure
by
which
persons
in
his
situation
were
required
to
try
to
vindicate
their
claim
to
american
citizenship.
and
in
particular,
with
respect
to
citizens'
claimants
abroad
as
dr.
cort
is
that
they
would
be
required
to
follow
the
procedures
of
sub-sections
(b)
and
(c),
in
other
words,
to
seek
certificates
of
identity
come
to
a
port
of
the
united
states
and
seek
to
vindicate
to
the
normal
exclusion
proceedings
of
the
immigration
service
there
claiming
that
they
are
not
aliens
but
citizens.
the
statute
provides
in
sub-section
--
the
statute
i
should
say,
covers
both
people
citizenship
claimants
who
are
within
the
united
states
and
those
who
are
without.
sub-
section
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
it
covers
all
claims
of
denial
of
nationality
whether
it's
done
by
passport
or
any
other
form.
it's
unique
for
denials
of
american
citizenship
status.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
this
is
the
1952
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
originated
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
it
--
no,
because
ms.
elg
was
within
the
united
states.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
it
would
have
--
at
the
time.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
in
fact
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
i
would
try
to
show
that
that's
what
congress
when
they
established
the
form
under
this
which
is
section
503
of
the
1940
act,
did
intend
to
make
an
exclusive
procedure
but
now
the
important
thing
for
the
moment
is
that
as
far
as
persons
within
the
united
states,
they
are
entitled
to
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
the
statute
says
so
in
sub-section
(a)
with
certain
exceptions
that
is
there
has
–
it
has
to
be
brought
within
five
years
after
the
denial
of
their
citizenship
claim
and
it
cannot
be
brought
if
the
issue
of
citizenship
arises
or
has
a
reason
in
an
exclusion
for
saving
that
is
specific
in
the
statute.
now,
sub-sections
(b)
and
(c)
provide
in
brief
that
persons
outside
the
united
states
have
to
seek
a
certificate
if
they
wish
to
challenge
the
administrative
denial
of
their
claim,
have
to
seek
a
certificate
of
identity
and
then
come
to
the
port
of
the
united
states
and
proceed
through
the
normal
immigration
procedures.
i
think
i
maybe
most
helpful
to
the
court
if
i
spell
out
somewhat
the
history
of
this
whole
matter.
start
before
the
1940
act,
the
nationality
act
of
1940
was
the
first
one
in
which
congress
did
try
to
establish
a
separate
special
procedure
for
testing
--
judicially
testing
nationality
claims.
before
that
time,
it
had
historically
been
true
that
the
way
that
citizenship
claimants
outside
the
united
states
tested
their
claim
to
citizenship
was
by
coming
to
the
port
and
suing
out
of
writ
habeas
corpus.
there's
a
well-known
case
of
ju
toy
decided
by
this
court
through
justice
holmes
in
1905
which
provided
that
that
was
the
correct
procedure
that
happen
to
be
a
chinese
case
but
it
was
applied
by
the
lower
courts
and
generally
to
non-chinese
claimants,
that
was
the
custom
method.
now,
in
1934,
congress
did
pass
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
i
think
i
state
this
situation
fairly
when
i
say
that
it
--
that
there
was
some
thought
that
perhaps
the
declaratory
judgment
act
might
apply
to
citizenship
claimants
outside
the
united
states.
some
ploy
on
the
part
of
certain
people
but
there
had
never
been
any
judicial
determination
of
that
and
that
position
was
controverted
by
many
people
that
--
who
thought
the
habeas
corpus
was
still
the
only
remedy
for
citizenship
claimants
outside
the
united
states.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
the
general
declaratory
which
was
passed
in
1934
before
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
elg
originated
under
the
general
declaratory
judgment
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
she
was
within
the
united
states
and
it's
interesting
to
know
that
until
the
elg
case
got
to
this
court,
the
government
strongly
contested
the
right
of
miss
elg
who
was
within
the
united
states
to
pursue
a
remedy
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
even
though
she
was
within
the
united
states.
so,
the
conclusion
that
i
draw
from
the
materials
is
that
there
was
no
accepted
view.
in
fact,
the
prevailing
view
was
to
the
contrary
that
an
alien
i
mean,
that
a
citizenship
claimant
outside
the
united
states
could
not
invoke
the
declaratory
judgment
act
but
had
to
proceed
by
habeas
corpus.
now,
this
comes
out
too
in
the
hearings
on
the
1940
act
because
the
people
who
represented
the
interests
of
aliens
and
citizenship
claimants
pointed
out
to
the
congress
that
in
the
1940
act,
congress
was
establishing
a
lot
of
new
procedures
in
which
laws
of
nationality
could
occur
and
couldn't
be
tested
because
habeas
corpus
would
be
alright
but
how
would
you
ever
get
to
the
country.
there
are
provisions
of
the
statute
penalizing
steamship
lines
for
bringing
people
to
the
country
without
proper
documents
and
if
it
turned
out
that
i
came
to
this
country
and
i
turned
out
not
to
be
a
citizen
and
didn't
have
a
visa
or
foreign
code
or
number,
the
steamship
line
would
be
penalized
and
therefore
they
wouldn't
want
to
take
me
at
all.
and
as
a
result
of
claims
of
that
kind,
that
under
the
existing
procedure
there
was
no
feasible
method
for
persons
abroad
to
test
their
right
to
relief,
congress
adopted
section
503
which
is
on
pages
5
and
6
of
our
brief.
now,
the
distinction
between
section
503
and
section
360
of
the
later
act
which
we
have
before
us
now
is
that
503
gave
a
declaratory
judgment
for
everybody
within
and
without
united
states
and
it
provided
that
those
without
could
get
certificates
of
identity
to
come
to
the
united
states.
and
it's
pretty
clear,
we
think,
this
came
into
the
statute
at
a
late
stage,
it
was
already
going
through
congress
when
it
came
in
and
from
the
statement
of
one
of
the
managers
on
the
part
of
the
house
which
we
--
which
appears
in
our
brief
on
page
--
pages
28
and
29,
congressman
reece.
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
there
was
great
doubt
as
to
whether
declaratory
judgment
would
be
available
to
persons
outside
the
united
states
and
congress
thought
that
they
ought
to
give
--
to
give
such
relief.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no,
mr.
justice,
you
mean
under
the
earlier
statute?
it
provided
that
if
you
were
outside
the
country
and
if
you
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
you
could
then
get
a
certificate
of
identity
to
come
to
the
country
to
prosecute
your
action.
if
i
may
hurry
on,
we
think
that
the
history
shows
that
though
this
was
the
intent
of
congress,
congress
later
began
to
back
up
from
this
liberal
view
because
after
world
war
ii,
a
large
number
of
actions
were
brought
mostly
by
persons
of
chinese
descent
to
test
their
claims
of
being
derivative
american
citizens.
and
in
the
space
of
i
think
five
or
six
years
over
1200
suits
were
brought
and
were
clogging
the
courts
in
certain
districts.
this
was
well-known
to
congress,
it
was
well-known
to
congress.
and
the
senate
judiciary
committee
which
had
been
entrusted
by
the
senate
with
the
review
of
all
these
immigration
and
nationality
legislation
as
a
prerequisite
to
the
new
bill
which
did
become
the
1952
act,
they
said
that
they
thought
that
the
old
remedy
of
503
of
the
liberal
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
had
been
carried
too
far.
and
their
recommendation
was
that
the
declaratory
remedy
judgment
should
be
limited
to
persons
within
the
united
states.
they
made
no
provisions
at
all
for
persons
outside.
presumably,
those
persons
would
have
to
follow
the
rule
of
habeas
corpus
even
without
a
certificate
of
identity,
they'd
have
to
get
to
the
country
as
best
as
they
could.
and
the
reasons
for
these
--
for
this
i
think
is
that
congress
thought,
i
think
it's
not
important
really
whether
congress
was
right
or
wrong
in
so
thinking
but
congress
did
think
that
in
these
many
cases
which
had
grown
up
under
section
503,
mostly
the
chinese
cases,
that
there
had
been
fraud
perpetuated
on
the
courts,
that
the
courts
in
declaratory
judgment
actions
without
any
prior
administrative
proceedings
or
any
prior
administrative
record
had
been
unable
to
seized
out
the
true
from
the
false
claims
of
american
nationality.
and
that
what
was
needed
was
an
administrative
investigation
and
administrative
record
and
then
judicial
review
after
administrative
record
had
been
accomplished.
now,
as
i
say,
the
senate
originally
proposed
that
there
being
no
remedy
of
any
kind
except
habeas
corpus
for
persons
outside
the
country.
now,
the
department
of
justice
speaking
through
the
deputy
attorney
general
peyton
ford
wrote
to
congress
and
said,
“we
don't
agree
that
persons
outside
the
country
who
have
a
non-frivolous
claim
of
citizenship
should
be
debarred.”
and
we
think
that
we
suggest
that
the
procedure
you
should
adopt
was
and
this
is
on
page
33
of
our
brief
that
they
shall
be
required
to
apply
for
admission
to
the
united
states
at
a
port
of
entry
and
to
go
through
the
usual
screening,
interrogation
and
investigation,
applicable
and
cases
of
other
persons
seeking
admission
to
the
united
states
so
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
will
have
this
complete
a
record
as
possible
on
each
person
entering
this
country
claiming
to
be
a
national
thereof.
and
after
that
suggestion
was
made
by
department
of
justice
to
the
senate
committee,
the
senate
committee
amended
its
bill
to
provide
the
procedure
of
(b)
and
(c)
which
carries
precisely
into
effect
what
deputy
attorney
general
had
recommended.
now,
i
think
it's
important
for
the
purposes
of
the
--
of
understanding
what
went
on
in
congress
to
realize
that
from
first
to
last,
the
senate
insisted
that
declaratory
judgment
be
limited
to
persons
within
the
united
states.
the
house
did
not,
the
house
bill
did
extend
declaratory
judgment
with
certain
limitations
to
persons
outside
but
the
senate
from
first
to
last,
insisted
on
this.
and
that
at
the
conference,
it
was
the
senate
bill
with
very
minor
changes
which
have
no
effect
at
all
on
issue
before
the
court,
the
senate
bill
which
was
adopted.
the
senate
proposal
was
adopted
by
the
conference
which
went
into
the
law
as
the
court
will
remember
over
the
objection,
over
the
veto
of
present
term.
now,
it's
also
important
that
the
senate
committee
which
recommended
to
the
senate
the
proposal
which
is
as
i
have
said,
just
--
just
said
was
adopted
by
the
congress
with
minor
modifications.
the
senate
committee
stated
after
amending
its
bill
to
provide
for
what
peyton
ford
had
suggested
and
this
is
on
page
34
of
our
brief.
“that
the
matter
of
fact
of
the
provisions
of
sub-sections
(b)
and
(c)
is
to
require
that
the
determination
of
the
nationality
of
such
person,
that
is,
persons
abroad
shall
be
made
in
accordance
with
the
normal
immigration
procedures,
these
procedures
in
full
review
by
habeas
corpus
proceedings
where
the
issue
of
the
nationality
status
of
the
person
can
be
properly
adjudicated”.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
says
precisely
in
terms
that
the
review
shall
be
by
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
and
not
otherwise
in
the
statute.
so
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
is
right.
our
whole
point
is
that
this
a
self-contained
procedure
which
supersedes
the
general
declaratory
judgment
law
which
fulfills
the
requirement
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
that
where
congress
is
set
up
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
a
special
statutory
provision
for
review
the
--
and
that
shall
be
the
system
for
review.
now,
i
mentioned
before
but
i
would
like
to
bring
out
again
that
what
congress
wanted
is
an
administrative
proceeding
by
which
the
facts
could
be
brought
out,
the
claimant
would
be
there
in
person.
the
immigration
service
which
is,
at
least
our
expert
body
in
this
field,
would
be
able
to
fair
it
out
what
information
it
could.
there
would
be
an
administrative
proceeding
subject
to
final
administrative
adjudication
and
then
review
by
the
courts
because
congress
felt
that
in
the
earlier
declaratory
judgment
proceeding,
the
absence
of
this
administrative
proceeding
had
led
to
frauds
and
failure
to
obtain
all
the
necessary
evidence
and
proper
determination
by
the
courts
on
a
proper
record.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
if
he
comes
as
a
certificate
of
identity
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
comes
as
a
person
who
is
an
applicant
for
admission.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
he
would
claim
that,
i
don't
know
what
the
government
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
in
other
words,
what
congress
really
decided
i
think
is
that
for
persons'
nationality
claims,
american
nationality
claims,
outside
the
united
states,
they
were
going
to
return
to
the
system
before
1940
where
habeas
corpus
was
the
appropriate
--
was
the
remedy
but
they
were
going
to
ameliorate
it
by
providing
for
the
certificate
of
identity
procedure
to
enable
him
to
come
to
the
country
more
easily.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
to
section
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
they
have
to
bring
--
they
have
to
come
to
the
port;
persons,
aliens
outside
the
united
states
have
to
come
to
a
port
and
seek
admission.
they
can't,
the
court
held
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
only
after
there
has
been
the
administrative
procedure
that
is,
they
can't
start
abroad
while
they're
abroad
before
they
come
here,
subject
to
themselves
to
the
regular
administrative
procedure
which
includes
the
making
of
a
record
and
a
final
determination.
the
court
specifically
held
in
the
tom
we
shung
case
that
they
couldn't,
they
couldn't
bring
a
declaratory
procedure
from
abroad
and
what
dr.
cort
has
done
is
to
bring
this
procedure
from
abroad
before
there
has
been
this
immigration
proceeding.
now,
mr.
boudin
will
obviously
say
that
there
has
been
a
state
department
administrative
proceeding
but
that
isn't
what
congress
wanted.
they
wanted
the
immigration
proceeding
to
take
place
before
there
should
be
judicial
review.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
answer
i
would
give
to
you
in
that
case
is
that
congress
did
not
want
him
to
be
able
to
seek
review
except
by
coming
--
getting
to
the
country
in
habeas
corpus.
now,
i
will
also
give
you
the
answer
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
now
it
maybe,
and
i
certainly
don't
want
to
say
this
is
so
but
it
maybe,
that
the
constitution
would
--
would
require
some
proceeding
other
than
that
for
such
a
person
but
that's
not
applicable
here.
now,
we
think
that
there
is
obviously
no
constitutional
difficulty
with
this
procedure
which
congress
has
established
in
section
360
because
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
congress
has
clearly
throughout
the
years
for
the
last
50
years
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
empowered
to
require
the
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedies
before
–
before
judicial
review
and
that's
what
congress
is
required
here
simply
that
there
be
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
before
you
can
come
to
the
court.
in
addition,
it
is
required
to
return
to
the
19
–
pre-1940
procedure
of
the
ju
toy
case
which
had
been
in
effect
for
about
50
years.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
congress
didn't,
that's
precisely
what
it
was
mr.
justice
douglas,
(voice
overlap)
they
assumed
that
many
of
them
would
not
be
citizens.
they
assumed
that
many
of
them
would
be
fraudulent
claimants
and
that
many
of
them
would
not
be
able
to
support
their
claim
and
because
they
assumed
these
as
of
many
of
them,
they
laid
down
this
general
rule
which
would
of
course
cover
some
who
would
be
able
to
maintain
their
claim
but
they
did
lay
down
the
general
rule
because
of
their
view
as
to
what
it
happened
under
the
earlier
statute
the
--
what
they
thought
of
is
the
inadequate
records,
the
fraud
that
had
occurred.
i
should
say
now
because
perhaps
it
will
be
brought
up
by
my
opponent
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
isn't
necessary
for
congress
in
setting
up
a
specialized
procedure
to
say
that
a
procedure
shall
be
exclusive
in
terms.
we've
used
the
example
of
flemming
against
nestor
which
is
a
review
proceeding
for
social
security
cases,
that
statute
does
not
say
a
note
proceeding
for
review
shall
be
brought
under
the
general
declaratory
judgment
act
or
in
under
any
other
statute.
just
like
this
one,
it
says
a
person
who
wants
to
challenge
may
bring
the
proceeding
and
we
think
it's
clear
from
the
history
of
this
court
that
you
don't
have
to
have
something
saying
explicitly,
you
shall
not
have
a
right
under
any
other
statute
when
congress
establishes
a
special
statutory
system.
i
emphasize
again
that
--
that
dr.
cort
has
been
invited
by
the
state
department
to
apply
for
a
certificate
of
identity
in
prague
but
he
has
not
done
so.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
system,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
there
is
a
practical
significance
mr.
justice
harlan.
one
practical
significance
is
that
under
the
system
like
congress'
established
the
citizenship
claimant
is
here,
he
can
testify,
he
can
be
examined,
he
may
refuse
to
testify
but
he
is
here.
dr.
cort
is
not
here,
he
is
bringing
the
suit
from
abroad.
he
may
--
he
is
not
here,
he
is
not
subject
to
cross
examination
and
so
forth.
the
second
thing
is
that
when
a
suit
is
brought
de
novo
with
a
district
court
and
this
turn
out
to
be
true
many
of
the
chinese
cases,
perhaps
it's
the
fault
of
administration.
but
there
isn't
the
kind
of
development
of
the
facts
and
the
evidence
which
there
is
when
an
applicant
applied
at
the
door
to
the
immigration
service
and
the
inspectors
of
the
immigration
service
seek
to
obtain
all
the
facts
and
make
a
factual
investigation
and
so
forth.
that
just
turns
out
to
be
a
different
kind
of
a
judicial
proceeding.
i
think
this
is
the
--
it's
akin
to
what
moved
congress
for
50
years
to
require
the
administrative
proceeding
labor
board
or
icc
or
whatnot
and
not
to
--
trusted
upon
courts
initially
that
administrative
proceedings
in
specialized
areas
sometimes
have
a
greater
ability
to
collect
the
facts
to
go
further
and
investigate,
the
system
evaluate
the
evidence.
and
then
after
that's
been
done
under
the
administrative
determination
was
made,
then
there
can
be
judicial
review.
and
i
should
say
at
once
because
that
the
question
is
also
not
here,
what
is
the
scope
of
administrative
review
once
gone
through?
that
is
not
a
question,
it
maybe
that
there
would
be
de
novo
judicial
review
even
in
habeas
corpus,
which
is
possible;
maybe
that
there
would
not
be
the
provisions
of
the
holding
of
the
ju
toy
case
would
still
be
considered
to
be
the
law
but
that
is
not
the
issue
now
because
dr.
cort
has
not
proceeded
through
the
administrative
procedure.
i
should
turn
now
to
the
statute
to
the
expatriation
statute
which
is
involved
both
in
the
proceeding
case
and
in
this
case
and
the
time
remaining
to
me
i
don't
wish
to
go
over
again
the
general
arguments
which
have
been
made
before
and
which
are
made
in
the
briefs.
i
would
like
to
stress,
if
i
may,
that
there
are
three
grounds
upon
which
the
expatriation
statute
can
be
upheld
but
to
discuss
only
one
of
them
a
little
more
extensive
than
the
others.
to
try
to
discuss
the
trop
case
and
to
indicate
what
possible
difference,
if
any
there
may
be,
between
the
case
of
dr.
cort
who
claim
that
he
is
stateless
if
he
is
denationalized
by
us
in
the
case
of
mendoza
martinez
who
was
a
national
of
mexico.
the
three
grounds
upon
which
a
statute
such
as
401
(j)
of
the
1940
act
and
349(a)(10)
of
the
1952
act
are
supported
we
believe,
the
foreign
affairs
power
--
the
power
of
congress
to
sever
its
relationship
with
the
person
who
repudiates
all
obligations
of
the
united
states,
all
authority
of
united
states
over
him
and
third,
the
war
power.
it's
important
with
respect
to
the
foreign
affairs
powers
to
recognize
that
this
statute
goes
into
effect
only
when
you
go
abroad.
it's
unlike
the
trop
case
in
which
desertion
could
occur
in
camps
in
the
united
states
where
there
was
no
relationship
to
going
abroad
at
all
necessary
in
the
--
with
respect
to
the
statute.
this
statute
is
triggered
only
by
a
person
who
evades
the
draft
by
going
abroad.
if
hold
up
in
the
tennessee
mountains,
it
does
not
go
into
effect.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
for
staying
abroad,
that
is
right
mr.
justice.
undoubtedly,
it
will
be
said
that
there
has
been
no
proof
that
there's
ever
been
any
international
difficulties
or
problems
because
of
american
national
fling
to
countries
abroad.
well,
that
maybe
so
because
in
the
past
we've
had
statutes
like
these
on
the
books
since
the
civil
war
compulsory
selective
service
only
went
into
effect.
it
was
in
effect
in
a
civil
war
for
little
while
and
then
in
world
war
i.
also,
the
countries
of
refuge
have
turned
out
like
mexico
to
be
allied
or
friendly
countries
in
world
war
ii
and
world
war
i
but
congress
could
properly
consider
what
would
the
situation
be
if
countries
perhaps,
not
friendly
counties
perhaps,
nearby
countries
that
were
not
friendly
would
become
centers
of
refuge
and
this
affection
by
large
numbers
or
people
or
draft
evaders
who
were
leaving
this
country
to
evade
the
draft
not
perhaps
for
personal
motives
or
perhaps
because
they
did
not
like
the
objectives
of
the
military
service,
the
foreign
affairs
purposes
of
a
country,
the
objectives
of
a
war
that
we
might
be
engaged
in.
it
is
not
at
all
fanciful
that
in
the
situation
like
this,
there
could
be
a
true
international
(inaudible).
the
united
states
tried
to
seek
the
return
of
these
evaders
in
other
countries,
the
country
of
the
refuge
could
seek
to
protect
them
and
claim
that
they
shouldn't
be
returned
and
there
would
be
difficulties.
but
difficulties
of
a
different
order
but
i
think
bearing
on
this
that
occurred
in
the
first
part
of
a
19th
century
with
respect
to
imprisonment
of
persons
by
a
various
countries
and
during
the
civil
war,
our
witness
to
this.
now,
the
other
support
for
the
position
for
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
is
the
fact
that
this
man
rejects
all
authority
of
the
united
states
over
him.
if
i
may
be
excused
for
using
the
corporeal
phrase,
“he
thumbs
his
nose
at
the
united
states.”
he
says,
“i
am
going
where
you
cannot
get
me.
there
is
no
extradition,
you
cannot
get
me
back,
you
cannot
subject
me
to
criminal
punishment.
i
have
evaded
the
highest
duty
of
citizenship,
the
military
duty
but
you
cannot
do
anything
to
me”.
now,
if
citizenship
is,
as
counsel
in
the
preceding
case
said,
a
contractual
tie,
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
citizen
perhaps
the
country
has
to
protect
it
and
to
take
care
of
him
in
certain
situations
but
he
has
at
least
the
obligation
of
subjecting
himself
to
the
authority
of
the
country
when
a
country
through
its
duly
constituted
government
tells
him,
“you
do
this
and
if
you
do
not
do
this,
you
shall
be
punished”,
and
if
he
doesn't
subject
himself
to
that
if
he
says,
“you
can't
do
anything
to
me.
i
have
gone
completely
beyond
your
power”,
then
he
has
really
himself
severed
his
relationship
with
the
country.
he
has
himself
abandoned
his
allegiance.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
because
we
don't
covered
it
in
our
brief
that
the
material
on
which
mr.
boudin
relied
which
appears
in
the
american
civil
liberties
union
brief
on
the
issue
of
360
relating
to
the
general
legislative
history
of
the
1952
act
in
section
106
which
was
proposed
and
which
was
deleted
that
that
entire
subject
deals
with
aliens
with
the
problem
of
deportation
and
exclusion.
the
immigration
service
did
try
to
get
a
provision
which
will
make
the
findings
--
administrative
findings
conclusive,
not
renewable
at
all
even
in
habeas
corpus
and
that
was
rejected.
and
this
court
in
the
pedreiro
and
the
tom
we
shung
cases
did
hold
that
declaratory
relief
would
be
available
for
deported
aliens
or
aliens
ordered
deported
or
aliens
ordered
excluded
but
two
things
are
very
important.
one
is,
that
the
1952
statute
has
no
provisions
for
judicial
review
of
alien
exclusion
or
deportation
are
matters
unlike
section
360,
one,
and
two,
that
the
court
allowed
declaratory
judgment
after
there
had
been
the
administrative
hearing
and
there
had
been
a
final
determination
and
there
was
an
administrative
record,
not
before
as
in
this
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
my
answer
mr.
justice
is
that
when
that
issue
arises,
it
will
have
to
be
decided
whether
congress
could
constitutionally
provide,
as
i
think
it's
sought
to
do,
that
citizens
who
--
americans
going
abroad
who
had
never
physically
been
present
in
united
states,
the
only
excluded
class
are
people
born
abroad
who
have
never
physically
been
in
the
united
states
and
who
are
over
16
years
of
age,
that's
the
only
exclusive
class
never
who'd
have
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
congress
intended
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
the
issue
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
fact
that
this
occurs
again
and
again
that
they
want
to
exclude
this
class
of
--
they
want
to
exclude
from
the
provisions
of
the
statute
this
class
of
persons.
i
would
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
determine
whether
that
could
constitutionally
be
done.
of
course
they
do
have
the
right
to
come
to
the
courts
and
seek
habeas
corpus.
now,
that
congress
did
not
seek
to
take
away
from
them.
they
could
come
to
canada,
mexico
or
to
ports
if
they
get
there.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
it's
inadequate.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
i
think
that
is
correct.
now
on
the
issue,
may
i
say
just
one
thing?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
thank
you
sir.
on
the
merits
of
constitutionality
on
the
issue
of
punishment,
i
would
just
like
to
recall
that
the
court
which
it
probably
well
now
is
already
that
it
is
three
times
recently
said
explicitly
that
to
accuse
congress
a
punishment
when
congress
did
not
think
that
it
was
imposing
punishment
would
require
a
tremendously
clear
showing.
it
did
that
and
said
that
in
the
flemming
and
nestor
case,
in
the
new
york
waterfront
case,
the
de
veau
against
braisted
and
in
the
communist
party
case
on
which
the
hearing
was
denied
yesterday.
i
think
you
will
not
find
in
this
--
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
or
the
terms
of
this
statute
anything
that
could
require
your
honors
to
say
that
there
had
been
such
a
clear
showing
that
what
was
not
punished
in
perez
is
punishment
in
this
case.
i
think
rather
congress
was
thinking
that
it
was
exercising
other
functions
than
the
functions
of
punishment
and
that
it
was
not
seeking
to
impose
punishment
without
criminal
--
without
punishment
in
the
constitutional
sense
without
criminal
procedure
which
as
the
constitution
requires
and
must
be
followed
if
punishment
is
to
be
imposed.
