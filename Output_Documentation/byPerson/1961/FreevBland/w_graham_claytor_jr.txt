mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
seems
to
be
lone
start
state
day
here.
this
case
is
also
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
treasury
regulations
which
are
incorporated
in
and
made
a
part
of
united
states
savings
bonds
provide
that
where
one
of
two
co-owners
of
the
bonds
die.
the
survivor
will
be
recognized
as
the
sole
in
absolute
owner
of
the
bond.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
provisions
of
this
regulation
shall
control
inconsistent
state
property
law
in
a
case
in
which
the
bonds
were
purchased
with
the
community
property
of
the
two
co-owners
in
whose
name,
they
were
registered.
now,
i'd
like
to
state
the
facts
and
the
procedural
posture
of
the
case
in
some
detail
in
order
to
show
just
how
the
question
is
brought
here.
between
1941
and
1945,
the
petitioner
here,
mr.
j.w.
free,
purchased
some
$86,000
of
united
states
savings
bonds
using
for
this
purpose,
the
funds
which
constituted
under
the
laws
of
texas,
the
community
property
of
himself
and
his
wife.
he
registered
these
bonds
in
the
joint
names
of
himself
and
his
wife
in
the
only
form
of
co-owner
registration
that
is
provided
for,
for
united
states
savings
bonds.
about
12
years
after
the
last
of
the
bonds
were
purchased,
mrs.
free
died.
she
left
a
will
in
which
the
respondent
here
mr.
james
bland,
her
son
by
a
fall
of
marriage,
was
named
executor
and
residuary
legatee.
the
controversy
then,
arose
between
her
husband,
mr.
free
petitioner,
and
his
step
son
bland,
over
the
ownership
of
the
bonds.
mr.
bland
contended
that
under
applicable
texas
property
law,
the
bonds
constituted
the
community
property
of
the
family
and
that
half
of
the
value
of
the
bonds
descended
to
mrs.
free's
estate.
the
petitioner
contended
that
under
the
treasury
regulations,
he
was
entitled
to
all
of
the
bonds
as
the
survivor
of
the
two
co-owners.
the
parties
stipulated
that
the
bonds
should
be
held
in
escrow
until
this
could
be
determined
and
the
petitioner
promptly
brought
suit
in
the
state
court
in
texas
asking
for
a
determination
that
he
owned
all
of
the
bonds.
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
supporting
affidavits
was
filed.
the
facts
had
been
stated
in
the
pleadings
and
affidavits
substantially
as
i've
given
them.
respondent
then
filed
an
amended
answer
and
a
cross
action
in
which
he
asked
that
half
the
bonds
be
a
judged
to
belong
to
him
or
at
least
that
he
should
have
equitable
ownership
of
half
the
bond.
and
in
this
cross
action,
he
made
the
same
allegations
of
fact
with
one
addition.
the
addition
being,
that
the
bonds
had
been
purchased
by
mr.
free
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
his
wife.
this
additional
allegation
was
then
denied
in
a
pleading
and
answer
to
the
cross
action
which
petitioner
free
subsequently
filed.
on
this
state
of
the
record,
the
summary
judgment
motion
came
on
to
be
heard.
the
state
trial
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
mr.
bland,
the
respondent
here.
the
court
holding
that
while
petitioner
free
was
entitled
to
the
bonds,
he
was
entitled
to
them
on
condition
that,
they'd
be
subjected
inter
alia,
in
favor
of
mr.
bland
for
half
their
value,
since
mr.
bland
in
fact
had
the
beneficial
ownership
of
half
the
bonds
through
descent
from
mrs.
free's
estate.
this
was
promptly
appealed
to
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals.
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
reversed
and
ordered
summary
judgment
and
it
for
petitioner
here.
that
court
held
that
the
treasury
regulations
controlled
and
were
intended
to
control
beneficial
ownership
that
they
so
preceded
inconsistent
provision
of
state
property
law
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
the
1958
case
had
so
applied
the
treasury
regulations
to
texas
property
law.
and
that
at
least
in
the
absence
of
fraud
or
unconscionable
or
unfair
dealing
that
there
was
no
question
but
that
title
of
the
bonds
was
entirely
in
the
husband
of
the
survivor.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
on
the
state
of
that
record,
there
was
no
fraud
or
constructive
fraud
or
improper
or
overreaching
activity
on
the
part
of
the
husband
that
it's
been
alleged
of
proof
and
there
was
therefore
no
basis
for
upsetting
the
survivorship
rule.
respondent
then
sought
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
while
the
writ
was
pending
--
it
was
being
a
discretionary
appeal,
while
the
writ
was
pending,
the
supreme
court
of
texas
handed
down
another
case
which
did
not
involve
united
states
savings
bonds
but
did
involve
cooperate
securities.
subsequently,
it
decided
this
case
per
curium
on
the
basis
of
the
other
case,
the
hilley
case.
so
that,
the
basis
for
decision
of
the
hilley
case
became
controlling
in
the
case
of
thought.
now,
hilley
v.
hilley,
the
case
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
decided
while
it
was
--
while
the
writ
of
error
was
pending,
was
a
case
in
which
a
husband
and
wife
in
texas
together
bought
corporate
securities
using
their
community
property
and
jointly
asked
that
the
securities
be
registered
in
their
joint
names
with
ownership
to
--
in
the
survivor.
this
was
done.
the
husband
subsequently
died
and
the
controversy
arose
as
to
whether
the
bonds
belong
to
the
wife,
in
accordance
with
the
registration
or
whether
half
of
the
securities
descended
to
the
husband's
estate
as
his
continued
community
property.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
held
in
a
very
lengthy
opinion
that
the
laws
of
texas
providing
for
community
property
provide
a
definite,
specific
method
by
which
the
parties
may
savor
all
petition
community
property
between
them.
it
may
only
be
done
if
an
agreement
is
executed
which
meets
the
technical
and
formal
requirements
for
a
conveyance
of
real
property.
that
purchasing
bonds
in
co-ownership
form
did
not
comply
with
the
texas
law
requirements
for
the
severance
of
community
property,
that
therefore
the
co-ownership
registration
had
no
legal
effect
in
texas
and
that
the
bonds
remain
community
property.
now,
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
treasury
bonds,
but
the
court
went
on
a
dictum
and
said
that
it
had
reconsidered
a
case,
it
had
decided
two
years
before,
in
ricks
versus
smith,
which
did
involve
treasury
bonds,
and
on
which
the
lower
court
had
relied
and
that
it's
specifically
overruled
that
case.
it
said
that
it
did
not
interpret
the
treasury
regulations
as
controlling
private
ownership
in
texas
that
they
didn't
believe
that
the
treasure
regulations
were
intended
to
reach
so
far,
and
that
therefore
the
same
rule
should
apply
to
savings
bonds
as
applied
to
corporate
securities.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
the
court
was
not
entirely
clear.
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
construction,
not
constitutional.
the
court
plainly
did
not
say
there
was
no
power.
the
court
said,
“federal
regulations,”
and
i'm
quoting,
"do
not
override
our
local
laws
as
in
matters
of
purely
private
ownership
by
the
interest
of
the
united
states
are
not
involved.”
they
cited
a
case
--
two
cases,
minority
view
from
other
jurisdictions
on
this
question,
which
had
plainly
gone
on
the
interpretation
of
the
regulations,
the
regulations
having
been
interpreted
in
these
other
cases
as
being
intended
only
to
provide
a
convenient
method
for
the
government
to
discharge
its
obligations
and
not
to
control
beneficial
ownership
of
title.
on
the
basis
of
this,
per
curium
judgment
was
entered,
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals,
ordering
summary
judgment
for
respondent
here
reinstating
in
effect
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court,
summary
judgment
for
respondent
for
half
the
value
of
the
bonds.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
well,
under
a
--
under
a
provision
of
the
texas
civil
code,
the
supreme
court
may
summarily
reverse
or
summarily
enter
an
order
on
an
application
for
writ
of
error,
where
the
case
is
squarely
inconsistent
with
another
case
which
is
the
court
has
decided.
and
this
--
this
was
in
effect
exactly
the
same
type
of
situation
that
this
court
often
that
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
filed
intervening
decision
by
the
court,
controlling
the
merit,
certiorari
granted
and
judgment
reverse
summarily.
it
was
done
on
the
application
for
--
for
writ
papers,
per-curium
without
any
other
discussion
except
to
say
that
was
settled
in
hillary
--
in
the
hilley
case.
now,
respondent
here
really
has
advanced
two
arguments
in
support
of
the
decision
below.
the
first
and
the
broadest
and
i
think
the
only
one
that
the
--
the
court
below
really
considered
is
that
the
treasury
regulations
with
respect
to
survivorship
of
co-owner
bonds
are
not
intended
to
control
beneficial
ownership
at
all
but
are
merely
intended
to
provide
a
convenience
by
which
the
government
may
pay
the
bonds
offered,
they're
becoming
embroiled
in
a
local
private
controversies
over
ownership.
a
narrow
argument
here
is
that
really
these
bonds
could
be
looked
upon
as
having
been
bought
with
someone
else's
property,
that
obviously
the
treasury
regulations
cannot
be
used
as
a
cover
up
for
fraud
or
for
conversion.
and
that
therefore
even
if
the
regulations
mean
to
control
beneficial
ownership,
you
can
go
behind
them
in
order
to
trace
someone
else's
property.
now,
i'd
like
to
deal
very
briefly
with
the
broader
question
first.
i
think
that
this
one
is
really
rather
easy
if
we
look
at
the
text
of
the
regulations
and
at
how
they
have
been
applied
over
some
25
years.
the
regulations
are
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief
at
pages
35
and
following,
and
there're
only
two
that
are
really
i
think
quite
pertinent
to
this
problem.
on
page
37
about
brief,
section
315.61
of
title
31
code
of
federal
regulations,
which
is
the
treasury
circular
--
the
provisions
of
which
are
incorporated
by
reference
on
the
phase
of
the
bonds
is
their
issue.
provide
that,
“if
either
co-owner
dies,
without
the
bond
having
been
presented
and
surrendered
for
payment
or
authorized
reissue,
the
survivor
will
be
recognized
as
the
sole
and
absolute
owner."
now,
to
make
sure
that
they
really
meant
that
this
was
to
control
beneficial
ownership
and
not
--
not
merely
method
of
payment,
it
was
provided
in
section
315.20
which
is
on
page
36
of
our
brief.
that
in
certain
cases,
state
decisions,
judicial
determinations
with
respect
to
conflicting
claims
of
ownership,
would
be
recognized
but
that
was
subject
to
this
very
specific
limitation.
“no
judicial
determination
will
be
recognized
which
would
give
effect
to
an
attempted
voluntary
transfer
inter
vivos
of
a
bond
or
would
defeat
or
impair
the
rights
of
survivorship
conferred
by
these
regulations
upon
a
surviving
co-owner
or
beneficiary
and
all
other
provisions
of
this
sub-court
are
subject
to
this
restriction.”
now,
the
government
here
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
in
which
they
have
set
out
at
considerable
length.
the
government's
--
the
treasury's
consistent
interpretation
of
these
regulations
and
have
explained
i
think,
quite
convincingly,
the
reason
why
the
regulations
with
respect
to
survivorship
and
beneficiary
provisions
which
are
the
only
ones
in
which
these
regulations
says
that
no
judicial
this
determination
will
be
permitted
to
change.
why
those
particular
ones
are
in
important
to
the
government
and
why
the
government
intended
to
make
the
bonds
subject
to
those
regulations
regardless
of
what
state
law
provide.
the
reason
is
that
savings
bonds
issued
under
the
second
limited
loan
act
of
1917
as
amended
in
1935
were
basically
designed
to
provide
a
safe,
simple,
and
attractive
method
of
investment
for
small
investors
and
particularly
for
family
savings.
now,
one
of
the
attractive
features
of
a
savings
bond
was
that
the
man
of
the
family
or
the
wife
of
the
family
could
take
his
--
his
or
her
money
invested
in
a
bond
which
was
payable
on
debt
to
his
wife
or
his
child
or
as
was
done
here,
invested
in
a
bond
in
the
name
of
himself
and
his
wife.
and
he
could
be
assured
and
was
assured
by
the
circulars
which
the
treasury
put
out
in
effect
to
prospectuses,
was
assured
that
if
he
die,
the
survivor
would
be
entitled
to
the
bond
and
there
would
be
no
difficulty
with
the
states,
the
administrations,
complicated
provisions
of
state
law,
validity
of
whether
there
had
been
a
gift
inter
vivos
under
the
varying
state
laws,
and
that
the
rule
would
be
the
same
whether
he
lived
in
texas
or
maine
or
california.
so
that
the
treasury
has
consistently
push
this
very
hard,
the
united
states
has
appeared
as
amicus
curiae
in
literally
dozens
of
state
cases
all
around
the
country,
through
the
district
attorneys
and
have
asserted
this
position.
the
state
courts
in
turn
have
upheld
this
interpretation,
the
overriding
interpretation
of
the
federal
regulation
in
the
great
majority
of
cases.
they
are
set
out
in
our
brief
for
--
passed
frankly
note
from
anyway,
set
out
in
our
brief
at
pages
23
and
24.
three
or
four
states
of
which
texas
is
one
have
adopted
a
mino
--
a
minority
view
giving
usually
the
reason
that
they
don't
interpret
the
treasury
regulations
to
this
way.
they
interpret
them
is
merely
controlling
method
of
plaintiff.
we
think
that
the
majority
rule
of
the
treasury's
interpretation
is
plainly
right
and
thus
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
which
refuse
to
follow
this
is
therefore
be
reversed.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
it
has
not
come
up
in
any
case
in
the
lower
federal
courts
that
i
know
of
except
the
couple
of
tax
cases
in
which
--
which
are
quite
distinguishable;
they
are
i
think
cited
in
our
brief.
they
involved
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
an
estate
tax
where
there
had
been
an
attempt
to
make
a
gift
of
a
--
of
a
--
a
bond
which
is
not
transferable
of
course
prior
to
debt.
and
the
court
has
in
--
i
think
two
courts,
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
when
the
third
circuit
have
a
situation
like
that
said,
“it
would
be
unconscionable
where
the
--
where
the
man
had
tried
to
divest
himself
of
his
ownership
here
to
impose
in
the
estate
tax
on
this
when
he
had
already
given
it
away
before
he
died.
even
though
the
treasury
regulation
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
this
is
actually
not
transferable.
i
think
those
cases
are
very
questionable
myself.
i
don't
that
they
are
--
are
inconsistent
with
the
position
we
take
here.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
in
most
of
the
discussion,
they
--
they
don't
quite
pass
the
language
that
specifically.
there
is
an
interesting
history
to
that,
which
is
set
out
in
--
in
both
our
brief
and
the
government's
brief
that
the
words
had
been
continually
strengthened
in
--
as
the
circular
has
been
amended
from
the
beginning.
initially,
the
language
was
the
--
was
more
general.
the
sole
and
absolute
owner
was
put
in
as
--
as
an
additional
indication
that
they
really
mean
what
it
said.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
the
word
recognize
--
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
--
is
a
basis,
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
--
let
me
say
that
if
we
were
dealing
with
this
a
priori,
one
could
certainly
make
the
argument
that
the
word
recognize
permits
a
different
interpretation.
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
often
we
are
talking
about
what
the
treasury
meant,
and
they
have
interpreted
it
to
this
way
for
25
years
publicly,
that
it
is
not
a
permissible
interpretation
to
say
that
it
really
means
more
than
--
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
yes.
bowels
against
the
seminole
rock
company,
there
--
there's
no
question
but
that
the
interpretation
has
been
consistent
in
public
and
--
and
unquestioned.
now,
there
is
a
second
question
here,
however,
that
has
been
raised.
basically,
the
argument
on
--
on
that
second
question
is
that
when
the
husband
both
bonds
using
community
property,
he
affected
a
--
what
is
called
a
constructive
fraud
on
his
wife's
property.
now,
i
think
all
it
can
be
meant
really
by
constructive
fraud
is
that
somehow
he
converted
the
property.
he
dealt
with
it
in
a
way
that
he
was
not
authorized
to
do.
now,
in
connection
with
that,
i
think
--
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
i
think
it's
in
a
--
in
a
sense
it
does.
there
is
this
much
to
it
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
we
should
make
perfectly
clear
that
neither
we
nor
the
government
takes
the
position
that
if
i
buy
a
co-owner
or
beneficiary
bond
with
somebody
else's
money,
that
somehow
i
insulate
him
from
getting
his
money
back.
there
is
no
--
the
treasury
has
never
taken
that
position.
the
--
that
question
really
isn't
presented
here.
we
must
--
the
--
the
problem
is
perhaps
raised
only
by
the
contested
allegation,
never
resolved
on
this
record
that
the
husband
purchased
the
bonds
without
the
wife's
knowledge
or
consent.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
you
see,
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
that
at
all
because
their
theory
was
that
even
if
the
husband
and
wife
had
purchased
them
together
as
they
did
in
the
hilley
case.
in
fact,
there
would
have
been
no
survivorship,
so
they
didn't
bother
with.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
that
property
doctrine
in
texas
and
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
now,
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
which
had
given
summary
judgment
for
our
petitioner
here
didn't
spell
this
out
fully
but
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
basis
on
which
they
disregarded
the
allegation
which
they
didn't
mention
in
their
opinion
was
that,
in
texas,
the
husband
has
a
very
broad
authority
as
the
manager
of
the
community
estate
to
decide
on
investment.
and
in
some
cases,
he's
been
permitted
to
spend
his
wife's
money
on
right
as
living
or
give
it
away.
but
in
any
event,
it's
clear
that
so
long
as
he
acts
in
good
faith
in
making
investments
with
the
community
estate,
he
is
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
as
the
manager.
so
they
examined
the
allegations
here
and
the
--
they
admitted
and
contested
allegation
and
said,
“there's
nothing
in
this
record
which
shows
an
overreaching
and
intent
to
takeaway
his
wife's
property
to
disadvantage
her
estate
in
favor
of
his
own
or
anything
which
we
could
call
fraud
or
constructive
fraud.”
at
the
time
of
the
purchase,
the
court
specifically
said,
“it
was
unpredictable
whether
the
husband
or
the
wife
would
die
first,
so
each
had
exactly
an
equal
interest
until
by
happens
then,
one
did
die
first."
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
it
is
not
necessarily
foreclosed.
i
feel
that
--
that
the
case
must
clearly
be
reversed
because
of
the
decision
--
because
of
the
basis
on
which
the
texas
court
went.
however,
i
think
a
second
question
is
presented
here
which
is,
that
the
policy
in
favor
of
survivorship
of
these
bonds
particularly
when
they
are
used
as
they
were
primarily
intended
to
be
used
as
the
repository
for
the
family
investment
of
family
savings.
there
is
a
strong
policy
to
favor
the
survivorship
and
not
permit
it
to
be
attacked
except
in
on
rather
extreme
case.
now
i
said
that
the
bare
allegation
which
one
might
make
in
--
in
any
litigation
just
to
hold
it
up.
the
fair
allegation,
even
if
true
that
there
was
--
the
husband
had
not
consulted
his
wife
about
the
purchase
of
these
--
of
bonds
out
of
the
community
property,
should
not
be
enough,
even
if
proved,
should
not
be
enough
to
override
the
federal
regulation
and
policy
in
favor
of
upholding
survivorship.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
i
think
that
would
have
a
bearing,
it
would
not
necessarily
be
controlling
but
it
would
certainly
have
a
bearing.
and
it
might
well
be
that
since
the
supreme
court
of
texas
didn't
reach
that
question,
although
the
court
of
civil
appeals
did,
you
--
you
would
not.
this
is
a
present
posture
of
the
case.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
if
it
were
held
--
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
--
well,
let
me
recite,
if
the
appellate
courts,
the
court
and
the
texas
appellant
court
hold
that
the
issue
raised
by
the
allegation
of
the
wife
knowledge
in
consent
would
be
controlling
if
she
hadn't
--
if
the
purchase
was
without
her
knowledge
and
consent
then
it
would
have
to
go
for
trial.
i
think
we
--
i
am
suggesting
here
that
in
the
light
of
--
what
i
think
is
the
uncontested
texas
law
on
--
on
the
power
of
the
husband
to
manage
the
estate.
if
this
court
suggested
that
if
that
is
the
texas
law,
this
court
cannot
pronounce
it
and
i
think
it's
fairly
clear.
but
if
this
court
said,
“if
that
is
the
texas
law,
the
mere
allegation
that
he
didn't
consult
his
wife
is
not
enough
to
defeat
the
federal
legislation.”
the
fact
would
be
that
when
the
case
got
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
there
would
never
be
a
trial
to
this
issue
because
it
would
be
immaterial
as
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
have.
i'd
like
to
save
for
rebuttal
sir.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
unless
some
member
of
the
court
has
some
further
questions,
i
have
no
further
argument
in
the
case.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
thank
you.
