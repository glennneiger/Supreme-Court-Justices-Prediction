mr.
olin
p.
mcwhirter
mr.
chief
justice,
honored
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
it's
a
pleasure
to
be
here.in
order
to
try
to
finish
the
argument
this
evening,
i'll
not
go
into
the
preliminary
part,
has
been
stated
fairly
closely
by
mr.
claytor.
on
march
2nd,
1959,
the
petition
--
petitioner
filed
his
original
suit
in
the
district
court
of
upshur
county,
texas.
the
petitioner
claimed
that
the
bonds
were
purchased
with
community
funds
of
he
and
his
wife
and
that
he
were
entitled
to
the
procession
thereof
by
reason
of
the
treasury
regulation.
the
respondent
countered
with
cross
action
and
claims
one
half
of
the
bond
or
he
may
alternative
a
money
judgment
for
one
half
to
value
of
said
bonds.
and
further
alleged
that
the
said
bonds
were
both
by
j.w.
free
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
mrs.
ida
free,
his
wife
with
community
funds
and
if
he,
bland,
the
respondent
herein,
was
not
the
owner
of
one
half
of
said
bonds,
then
his
mother's
estate
had
been
depleted
in
the
sum
of
approximately
$44,000.
and
therefore,
the
estate
of
ida
free
should
be
reimbursed
for
that
sum
of
money
if
it
was
determined
that
j.w.
free
was
entitled
to
said
bonds.
on
november
the
23rd,
1959
the
trial
court
at
gilmore
found
that
mr.
free
was
the
owner
of
the
bonds
and
awarded
the
bonds
to
mr.
free.
and
at
the
same
time,
he
awarded
mr.
bland
a
money
judgment
for
one
half
of
the
value
of
the
said
bonds,
the
bonds
amounting
to
at
the
time
of
her
death
$87,035.50,
and
the
one
half
judgment
which
he
rendered,
one
half
value
of
thereof
being
$43,517.75.
petitioner
free
was
dissatisfied
by
the
trial
court's
judgment
and
appeal
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
at
texarkana.
the
texarkana
court
handed
down
its
decision
and
awarded
j.w.
free
the
bonds.
and
the
full
title
in
procession,
free
in
clear
then
it
claim
by
mr.
bland.
the
respondent
dissatisfied
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
sued
out
a
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
of
our
state.
and
the
supreme
court
on
march
8,
1961,
the
court
of
texas
said,
"it
was
its
opinion
that
there
was
error
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals,
but
there
was
no
error
in
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
rendered
if
judgment
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
and
setting
aside
its
judgment.‚Äù
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed.
the
court
stated
that
the
court
of
civil
appeals
followed
the
ruling
in
the
case
of
ricks
versus
smith,
and
that
case
had
been
overruled.
the
petitioner
then
filed
and
asked
the
supreme
court
for
rehearing,
and
the
court
duly
overruled
his
motion
for
rehearing.
you
will
find
his
motion
for
rehearing
on
page
55
of
the
transcript.
the
petitioner
then
filed
his
writ
of
error,
his
writ
of
--
for
certiorari
to
this
honorable
court
and
the
court
granted
the
same.
why?
i
do
not
know
unless
this
court
has
found
the
case
in
such
a
case,
in
which
it
could
write
an
opinion
on
and
concerning
the
reimbursement
and
the
accounting
questions
presented
in
order
to
clarify
the
law
in
the
minds
of
some
parties.
we
really
don't
think
the
federal
question
is
involved
in
this
case.
why
do
i
say
this?
because,
the
laws
of
the
state,
of
the
united
states,
the
treasury
regulations,
have
not
been
violated
or
disregarded
in
any
shape
for
more
fashion.
the
treasury
regulation
provides
among
other
things
concerning
the
co-owner
bonds,
the
survivor
will
be
recognized
as
the
sole
and
absolute
owner,
not
that
the
survivor
will
--
that
the
surviving
co-owner
will
be
the
sole
and
absolute
owner.
the
courts
on
passing
on
this
case
up
to
this
time
have
held
repeatedly
that
mr.
free
is
entitled
to
the
bonds
and
have
awarded
the
bonds
to
him.
the
court,
trial
court,
district
court,
awarded
the
bonds
to
mr.
free,
even
judgment
for
the
title
and
procession
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
did
likewise,
the
supreme
court
of
texas
did
likewise,
and
at
the
rehearing
did
likewise.
so
there're
four
--
three
courts
that
passed
on
the
matter,
and
they
have
said
mr.
free
is
entitled
to
the
bonds
and
we're
ready
to
deliver
them
to
him.
now,
because
of
the
holdings
of
the
texas
courts
and
other
courts
of
our
land,
mentioned
in
our
brief,
we
think
this
honorable
court
should
dismiss
this
writ
of
certiorari
as
improvidently
granted
as
there
is
no
federal
question
involved.
mr.
olin
p.
mcwhirter
not
necessarily.
no
sir,
no
sir.
the
petitioner
then
knows
there
is
no
federal
question
presented,
but
he
is
up
in
arms
because
he
will
have
to
give
up
$43,517.75
of
his
ill-gotten
gains
to
his
step
son
james
f.
bland
who
is
justly
entitled
to
receive
the
same
under
the
law
in
equity
and
under
his
mother's
will.
this
feature
of
the
case
is
a
local
matter,
a
state
matter
and
not
a
federal
question.
we
--
the
courts
throughout
our
land
have
recognized
that
the
every
administrative
body
including
the
treasury
department
of
the
states
have
rule
making
power
to
extend,
to
the
extent
of
governing
its
procedure
and
activities
within
statutory
limits,
and
may
be
given
power
to
make
rules,
orders
and
regulations,
having
the
force
in
effect
of
law
without
thereby
changing
it
from
an
administrative
to
a
legislative
body.
but
in
making
such
rules
and
regulations,
the
liberty
in
the
property
rights
of
citizens
must
be
protected.
the
courts
hold
at
the
purpose
of
the
treasury
regulations
providing
their
beneficiary
or
co-owner
bonds,
shall
be
recognized
as
the
sole
owner
and
absolute
owner.
he
is
to
protect
and
to
hold
the
federal
government
immune
in
harmless
from
any
attack
for
only
performances
of
a
contract
made
in
the
bonds
and
prevent
implications
of
the
government
in
disputes
concerning
ownership
which
we
think
is
a
very
wise
provision
of
the
law.
these
laws
and
regulations
are
not
intended
to
confirm
the
beneficiary
of
co-owner
the,
right
to
retain
permanently
the
proceeds
from
the
bonds
irrespective
of
fraud
or
any
illegality
or
inequitable
conduct
in
which
said
bonds
were
obtained.
the
government
is
not
going
to
appoint
itself
as
a
guardian
of
j.w.
free
or
anyone
else
and
follow
him
around
indefinitely
try
to
protect
him
from
any
legitimate
claim
thereto
these
regulations
in
and
terminate
upon
the
recognition
of
the
registered
owner
and
the
cashing
of
the
bonds.
the
fact
that
treasury
regulations
providing
for
ownership
of
title
to
united
states
bonds
in
surviving
co-owner
will
not
preclude
this
court
or
any
other
courts
of
our
land
from
permitting
others
to
pursue
the
first
--
the
proceeds
and
the
court
will
not
hesitate
to
impose
constructive
or
resulting
trust
on
the
proceeds
in
order
to
achieve
a
fair
result
in
cases
of
fraud
or
inequitable
conduct.
the
government
of
the
united
states
does
not
want
j.w.
free
to
wrongfully
defeat
the
rights
of
mrs.
ida
free
or
her
son.
and
this
court
is
here
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
said
heir
as
the
texas
courts
have
already
done.
in
texas,
the
husband
has
given
general
authority
to
manage
and
convey
community
property.
however,
and
although
he
may
give
it
or
convey
to
a
third
party,
cannot
give
it
to
himself
or
to
his
estate.
he
cannot
enrich
his
estate
by
his
handling
of
the
community
property.
if
it
does,
it
is
a
constructive
fraud
upon
his
wife's
estate,
and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
there
is
not
always
a
necessity
of
proving
an
actual
intent
to
defraud
or
an
improper
motive
on
the
part
of
the
husband.
if
his
acts
result
in
a
loss
to
his
wife's
estate
and
in
enrichment
of
his
estate,
that's
what
we
have.
we
have
here
$43,517.75
confiscation
of
the
property
as
which,
if
we
should
follow
the
petitioner
in
his
thinking
in
this
case.
the
treasury
regulations
do
not
purport
to
determine
rights
of
reimbursement
between
the
estates
of
spouses
or
the
use
of
community
funds
or
between
partners
and
partnership
nor
to
make
any
rules
of
law
about
an
accounting
or
an
adjustment
of
funds
used
in
the
purchase
of
the
bonds.
these
are
local
state
matters
such
as
probate
matters,
laws
of
descent
and
distribution.
there
are
no
cases
cited
in
the
law
books
of
this
nation
and
then
ever
will
be
a
whole
that
holds
that
where
the
bonds
are
the
result
of
fraud
or
constructive
fraud.
the
person
so
defrauded
cannot
pursue
the
proceeds
of
such
bonds
in
the
hands
of
one
who
is
a
party
to
defraud
or
constructive
fraud.
in
conclusion
gentlemen,
let
me
say
that
in
my
opinion
from
all
the
facts
in
the
law,
the
writ
should
be
dismissed.
however,
if
the
court
sees
fit
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
recognizing
the
ownership
of
the
bonds
and
j.w.
free
and
allowing
a
money
judgment
in
favor
of
bland
against
free,
we
have
no
objection
to
your
so
finding.
thank
you
gentlemen.
