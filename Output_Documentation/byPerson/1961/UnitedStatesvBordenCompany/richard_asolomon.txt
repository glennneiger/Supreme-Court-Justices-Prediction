mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
i
can
be
very
brief.
i
don't
want
to
relitigate
this
question
of
whether
we
were
trying
to
show
a
price
discrimination
with
respect
to
a
system
or
nine
stores,
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
we
were
showing
a
discriminatory
system
based
on
the
entire
discount
schedule
which
bowman
had
generally
applicable
throughout
chicago
in
which
nobody
has
suggested
throughout
the
entire
argument
below
or
here
was
ever
deviated
from.
nobody
suggests
that
any
independent
store
ever
got
more
than
the
maximum
of
8%.
there's
no
suggestion
of
any
deviation
and
it's
perfectly
clear
that
what
this
case
was
about
as
judge
campbell
recognized,
was
whether
this
system
could
be
cost
justified
or
whether
it
could
be
cost
justified.
more
than
that
as
i
pointed
out
before
on
his
alleged
proof
about
this
nine
stores
as
i
read
you
from
page
330
when
you
looked
on
how
they
proved
that,
that
again
was
based
on
these
assumptions
as
to
this
customer
services
etcetera.
basically,
as
far
as
we
can
see,
this
case
is
a
very
simple
one
and
illustrates
very
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
without
relitigating
my
argument,
i
can
only
say
i
don't
read
the
first
two
paragraphs
on
page
330
to
mean
that
there
is
no
argument.
as
i
read
what
they
say,
they
make
it
perfectly
clear
with
respect
to
this
study
of
these
nine
stores
that
they
were
again
based
on
assumptions
and
we're
not
doing
it
on
any
basis
of
any
study.
i
read
this
to
the
court
before,
i
can
only
say
read
the
last
paragraph
on
page
329
and
the
top
two
paragraphs
on
page
330
and
then
of
course
it's
not
a
question
who
--
what
mr.
stevens
or
i
think,
is
what
your
honor
thinks.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
basically,
this
case
is
i
think
very
simple
one
and
particularly
simple
with
respect
to
the
problems
that
justice
douglas
mentioned
before.
we
have
the
start
of
a
very
reasonable
system
by
moment
i
agree.
it
was
counsel
for
bowman
that
there
are
methods
of
discounts
up
to
the
limit
they
cut
off
that
for
the
independent
stores
is
a
very
reasonable
one,
very
fair
and
equitable.
all
we
have
to
do
--
to
do
--
make
this
a
fair
system,
the
type
of
system
much
can
be
applied
in
the
future
defendant,
irrespective
of
where
the
actual
figures
are,
are
three
things
one,
don't
cut
it
off,
let
it
continue
on
to
its
natural
resting
place
depending
on
what
the
stores
actually
take
in
volume.
two,
if
there's
a
differential
as
there
undoubtedly
is
for
in
store
services,
say
that
the
price
to
stores
taking
in
stores
services
will
be
this
much
more
than
the
stores,
then
don't
take
this
in
store
services.
and
three,
if
there's
a
difference
admittedly
a
small
difference
with
respect
to
cash
customers
as
against
credit
customers,
charge
the
cash
customers
more.
to
simple
as
that.
if
you
set
up
your
discount
on
a
rational
basis
which
is
open
to
everybody
who
wishes
to
qualify
for
it
and
can,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
any
classification
problem
and
cost
justification.
you
don't
have
to
worry
justice
black
about
the
details
of
whether
you
can
do
this
on
an
individual
basis
or
a
general
basis
because
the
whole
problem
won't
arise.
the
difficulties
here,
the
inherent
difficulties
here
are
not
that
bowman
has
got
a
false
classification
as
a
cost
justification,
that
i
suggest
is
unnecessary
consequence
of
the
fact
that
their
discount
system
was
a
false
discount
system
and
that
can
be
simply
taken
cared
off.
