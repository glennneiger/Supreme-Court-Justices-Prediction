but
as

and
isn't

justice

would
you
say
that
it
was

that
where
you
gave

higher
than

the

was
really
irrelevant?

before

what
about

i
wonder
what
kind
of

i
wonder
what
kind
of
a
decree
would
--
would
it
be
a
decree
written
in
terms
of
the
statute?
and
if
so,
how
would

justice
william
o.
douglas
where
is
the
rebuttal
or
the
exhibit?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
mr.
stevens,
is
it
your
suggestion
that
if
you
deci
--
if
the
lower
court's
opinion
is
affirmed,
that
your
entire
price
system
is
a
--
is
upheld
or
do
you
say
that
just
these
particular
stores
which
are
involved
in
the
government's
prima
facie
are
disposed
of.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
get
the
suggestion
from
what
you
said
in
the
last
few
minutes
that
if
you
meet
these
representative
instances
which
the
government
has
presented
that
you
would
think
that
the
government
would
be
barred
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
from
relitigating
any
other
store?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
saying
all
that's
involved
in
this
lawsuit
are
these
particular
stores
and
that
nothing
else
about
your
pricing
system
is
involved
in
this
lawsuit
or
would
be
disposed
of
or
decided
upon
or
passed
upon?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
which
way
do
you
look
at
it
as
--
as
--
as
to
those
to
either
way,
you
say
look
at
it
either
way
but
which
way
do
you
look
at
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
say
that
a
fair
--
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
below
is
that
only
these
nine
stores
were
considered?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
the
lower
court's
opinion
is
affirmed
in
it's
--
in
its
present
form,
would
you
say
that
--
that--
let's
just
assume
that
we're
affirmed
for
per
curiam,
would
you
say
that
--
that
the
entire
pricing
system
--
your
pricing
system
was
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
was
being
approved?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
the
only
reason
you
wouldn't
be
barred
because
of
the
same
conditions?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
mr.
stevens,
didn't
the
--
wasn't
a
part
of
the
government's
prima
facie
case
a
--
your
entire
discount
schedule?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
included
at
the
two
letters
to
the
chains
which
represented
a
goodnumber
of
stores?
justice
william
o.
douglas
wasn't
that
part
of
their
prima
facie
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
in
those
issues
are
