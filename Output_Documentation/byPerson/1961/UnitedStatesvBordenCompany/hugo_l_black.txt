is
that
the

that's
printed

statement

where
is
that
in
the

justice

black
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
hugo

it
says
more
than
what?
justice

how
--
where
was
it
limited
in
their
books?
justice
hugo

black
is
that
the
issue
raised
by
the
plea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
the
--
to
the
pleading
was
limited
to
a
prima
facie
related
to
eight
stores
--
its
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
entire
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
act
regard
has
to
be
decided
by
what
happened
in
connection
with
the
state
to
all
these
eight
stores?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
it's
much
the
same
as
if
the
government
has
given
you
to
fill
a
particulars
saying
which
costumers
involved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this,
my
trouble
which
is
wholly
i'm
sure
you
can
claim,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
if
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
chief
purposes
of
this
act,
maybe
i
am,
was
to
prevent
the
chain
store
combined
goods
cheaper
than
the
independents?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
the
court's
provision
and
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
the
act
was
drawn
in
a
way
so
it
would
say
that
no
sales
shall
be
made
to
a
chain
store
cheaper
than
the
independent
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
course
it
didn't
urge
it.
he
has
the
provision
about
cost;
i
haven't
been
quite
able
to
follow
either
of
your
arguments
on
this
accounting
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this,
what
you're
saying
is
that
you
have
fixed
the
classification
as
i
understand,
in
which
classification
you
put
all
of
the
chain
stores
or
independent
who
are
getting
sales
cheaper
on
account
of
volume
to
that
other
thing?
and
if
so,
what
other
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
depend
on
volume?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
store.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
store.
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
the
only
one
there
that
gets
the
discount?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
to
get
a
concrete
data?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
many
other
stores
but
i
have
seen
two
very
large
stores
in
florida
and
i'm
wondering
how
would
you
go
about
to
determine
whether
a
store
like
those
two,
one
at
st.
petersburg
and
one
at
miami
tremendous
volume
of
purchase
of
sales
that
was
just
having
good
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
they
would
--
how
would
they
be
classified?
what
elements
or
factors
you'd
take
in
consideration
in
determining
whether
they
would
get
the
same
discount
to
the
chain
store?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
circumstances
mean
more
than
volume
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
have
you
said
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
amounted
cost
to
deliver
that
various
according
to
different
costumers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
other
one
--
one
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
looking
at
this
schubert
and
the
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
correctly
that
schubert's
volume
as
compared
with
the
volume
of
individual
a&p
and
stores
in
chicago
is
equal
or
superior
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
there
is
a
--
question
of
whether
there's
a
sufficient
additional
cost
delivered
to
schubert
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
over
the
a&p
although
you
deliver
each
one
to
the
individual
stores
or
do
you
deliver
to
a&p
at
a
central
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
basis
of
your
contention?
that
what
you
have
--
what
you
insist
on
is
that
the
law
requires
that
they
make
a
cost
justification
for
each
store?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
of
this
formula?
i
don't
understand
the
complete
consequence
as
yet
in
which
you
say,
does
it
result
in
giving
a
discount
of
8%
to
all
chain
stores?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
was
just
asking
if
you
then
--
i
was
asking
if
you
can
take
it
all
and
if
the
result
it
was
denying
that
discounts
to
all
independent
or
if
not
something
about
what
the
sum
total
of
the
actual
practical
consequences
of
the
way
it
worked?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
that
argument
is
any
more
than
the
argument
that
although
you
can
see
that
there
can
be
categories
and
classification?
they're
not
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
particular
classification
which
they
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
somehow,
the
sum
total
of
your
argument
that
is
that
they
have
discriminated
against
independents
as
such,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
what
i
think?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case,
what
is
the
practical
result
of
reference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
being
then
--
it
is
or
is
it
not
that
under
this
as
it
functions,
no
independent
can
get
11%
discount
while
all
the
chains
can.
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
argument
that
the
basis
being
for
that
--
that
the
systems
are
so
different
that
an
independent
cannot
possibly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they've
been
able
to
prove
that
all
no
independent
is
entitled
the
more
than
the
critical
number
of
points
you
suggested
at
least
200,
suppose
they
may
be
able
to
prove
that,
would
you
say
then
they
could
be
classified
this
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
impose
the
duty
on
a
court
trying
one
of
these
cases
to
look
to
see
if
justification
for
the
classification
is
supported
by
evidence
in
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
different
--
different
community?
justice
hugo
l.
black
upon
which
part
of
it
that
burden
risk
in
connection
to
that
proof?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
the
burden
of
proving
prima
facie
that
that
has
been
a
difference
in
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
that
classification,
what
is
the
cost
differential?
what
value?
what
is
the
amount
to
on
a
quart
of
milk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
difference
of
3%.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
claim
that
that
would
not
be
a
factor
of
importance
of
selling
in
the
price
in
which
they
could
sell
competitively?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
in
fact,
if
it's
on
in
individual
basis,
that
would
mean
that
you
have
to
decide
in
each
case
on
an
individual
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
before
you
start.
so
i
could
understand
your
argument
further,
do
you
agree
that
--
or
disagree
with
what
i
understood
to
be
the
statement
if
your
formulization
works
out
and
certainly
that
no
independent
i
gets
the
benefit
of
the
full
discount?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
want
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
believe
that
such
a
result
would
be
proper
under
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
he
said
that
your
comment
they
result
in
excluding
all
independents
and
that
giving
discounts
greater
than
to
all
chain
stores.
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
could
be
shown
in
some
ways
that
such
a
result
is
not
necessarily
under
your
formulization.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
customer
per
store?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
had
been,
what
would
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
argued
here
--
do
you?
that
the
government
picks
out
eight
to
ten,
11
to
12
cases
or
objective
cases,
showed
there's
none
a
difference
in
cult
that
if
it
is
shown
that
you
can
fully
answer
the
differential
simply
by
showing
at
the
reference
of
the
particular
ones
picked
out,
it
might
have
been
a
justification
or
that
there
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
you're
basing
the
whole
thing
on
a
classification
of
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
not
doing
a,
"store
to
store
basis?"
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
still
bothers
me
about
that
argument
is
number
one,
i
do
not
understand
that
either
argument
take
the
position
that
you
must
determine
it
on
a
store
to
store
basis;
that's
number
one.
number
two,
i
would
suppose
that
when
the
government
shows
that
there
have
been
price
differentials
made
within
the
classification,
that
you
will
have
to
show
that
the
whole
classification
was
just
--
with
that
regard
to
those
particular
eight
to
ten
stores.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
sounds
like
a
store-by-store
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
had
in
this
group
that
he
claims
which
in
reference
to
one
or
the
other
i
forgot
which,
but
i'm
asking
you
this
because
i
want
you
to
do
an
instance
where
he
admitted
that
they
had
not
been
a
study
made
of
all
the
people
in
that
group
or
that
classification.
it
was
based
on
the
assumption
which
i
understand
you
would
simply
say
that
in
independent,
one
who
is
inefficient
as
the
other,
that
he
wouldn't
deliver
it
and
he
wouldn't
meet
those
requirements
and
your
classification
still
included
them.
if
you
think
that
because
you
could
show
that
particular
stores
the
government
have
to
pick
out
after
make
up
its
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
or
differential
in
sales
because
you
haven't
been
able
to
prove
that
that
particular
store
that
man
was
not
as
efficient
would
justify
your
classification.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright,
well
i
can
see
that.
i
--
maybe
i
used
the
wrong
word
efficient.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
meant
was
that
all
chains
--
all
independents
would
use
the
more
costly
method
instead
of
the
less
expensive
method.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
difficulty
in
seeing
particularly
because
it
seems
to
me
that
borden
takes
the
different
position.
your
position
seems
to
be
that
you
should
do
this
on
a
store-by-store
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
store-by-store
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
showing
each
particular
instance,
do
you
think
the
act
authorizes
or
either
requires
or
authorize
of
that?
i'm
not
sure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
too
not
inconsistent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
too
not
inconsistent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i
don't
get
it.
the
idea
that
you
decided
on
a
store-by-store
basis,
the
idea
that
you
did
on
a
classification
basis
which
includes
the
number
that
may
have
be
approximately
the
same
with
the
same
but
different
in
respect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
have
to
show
that
or
would
you
have
to
show
that?
who
--
upon
whom
is
the
burden
of
proof,
the
cause
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
that
require
the
government
to
do
just
that
which
is
an
indicator
that
you
said
not
necessary
to
do
and
go
on
the
whole
field
and
try
to
test
out
every
differentials
to
every
customer
in
the
whole
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
chicago,
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
find
it
case-by-case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
we'll
take
it
tomorrow
if
this
case
should
be
affirmed,
if
i
understand
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
start
and
all
the
other
price
differences
and
the
cost
wherein
this
was
not
a
res
judicata
at
all
with
reference
to
them
or
reference
to
the
system
you
used.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
that
regard
to
the
change
of
the
market,
suppose
it
hadn't
change,
could
they
litigate
with
reference
to
the
difference
in
prices
with
reference
to
other
than
these
nine
stores
tomorrow
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
this
should
be
affirmed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
all
they
can
yet
decide
it
and
that
may
be
right.
all
they
can
yet
decide
it
is
on
a
case-by-case
basis
whether
it's
justified
by
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
would
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
be
based
on
the
idea
that
you
had
only
adjudicated
here
between
--
as
to
nine
stores.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
this
demonstrates
that
there's
really
a
problem
about
whether
this
can
be
done
on
a
classification
basis
throughout
the
large
parts
of
the
economy
or
that
maybe
it
has
to
be
done
on
a
case
to
case
basis.
