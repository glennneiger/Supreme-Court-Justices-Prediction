mr.
stuart
s.
ball
may
it
please
the
court.
certain
resemblances
between
the
facts
and
the
argument
but
there
are
a
number
of
conflicts
between
the
statements
made
in
the
actual
record.
for
the
history
of
this
case,
after
this
was
remanded
on
february
2nd
of
1955,
the
government
moved
to
reopen.
the
government
then
put
in
a
schedule,
listing
in
the
case
of
the
borden
company
in
two
schedules,
something
and
total
of
13
stores
and
said,
"this
is
our
prima
facie
case,
a
distinction
between
these
13
stores."
three
of
the
stores
--
four
of
the
stores
were
a&p
stores,
one
was
a
jewel
store.
the
other
eight
were
independents.
the
prima
facie
case
of
the
government
related
to
the
price
discriminations
between
those
particular
stores.
the
stipulation
we
agreed
with
the
government
with
respect
to
those
eight
independents
showed
that
the
a&p
and
the
jewel
stores
were
receiving
eight
and
a
half
percent
discount.
three
of
the
eight
independents
were
receiving
five
and
a
half
percent
discount.
one
was
receiving
four
and
the
remainder
only
3%
discounts.
those
were
the
only
discounts
that
were
involved
in
the
government's
prima
facie
case.
attached
to
these
exhibits,
were
certain
schedules
which
showed
that
there
had
been
a
general
offering
to
all
groceries
based
upon
four
classifications
of
volume.
no
percentage,
2%,
3%
and
4%.
that
was
offered
to
all.
it
also
showed
a
separate
letter
to
a&p
giving
them
for
all
of
the
stores
in
the
area,
eight
and
a
half,
a
separate
letter
to
jewel,
giving
them
for
all
of
their
stores
eight
and
a
half
and
the
face
of
the
record
that
separate
deals
had
been
made
with
these
three
out
of
the
eight
independents
giving
them
five
and
a
half
percent.
now,
the
implication
here
is
and
told
you
all
the
way
through
that
we
prohibited
independents
from
getting
more
than
4%.
let
me
read
you
the
section
that
counsel
read
on
page
76
of
the
record
which
was
the
stipulated
facts.
referring
to
exhibit
a,
which
was
the
general
schedule,
the
march
1955
and
december
1954
discounts,
paid
to
the
independently-owned
store
customers
listed
on
schedules
one
and
two
attached
and
that
refers
to
the
eight
independent
customers
were
computed
and
paid
in
accordance
with
exhibit
a,
with
the
exception
of
the
discounts
paid
to
customers
(inaudible)
schubert
and
arthur
cartman
listed
on
schedule
2.
we
never
stipulated
that
these
were
the
only
three
independents.
they
got
more
than
the
4%,
in
fact,
there
are
more,
the
question
never
arose
in
this
case.
the
only
question
with
respect
to
this
--
this
--
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
we
ever
limited
independent
stores
to
4%.
this
is
a
gratuitous
assumption
made
for
the
first
time
in
the
briefs
in
this
court
and
not
presented
by
the
record
below
or
argued
in
the
court
below.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
the
point
is
that
the
prima
facie
case
dealt
with
eight
independent
stores
and
two
chain
store
customers.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
and
out
of
those
eight.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
nor
was
it
relevant
because
all
we
had
to
justify
were
the
discriminations
which
were
the
government's
prima
facie
case.
we
never
assumed
the
burden
of
trying
to
take
care
of
all
of
the
special
discounts
that
might
be
given
in
this
community
because
that
was
not
what
the
government
deliberately
cited
for
their
prima
facie
case.
now,
on
the
time
element,
these
facts
with
these
schedules
were
first
stipulated
at
the
request
of
the
government
in
november
of
1955.
before
that,
these
lists
had
been
given
with
us.
we
undertook
a
cost
study
which
i
will
describe
tomorrow
and
it's
an
entirely
different
one
than
is
--
what
was
discussed
in
the
brief
or
in
argument
in
detail.
because
it
is
a
cost
justification
customer
by
customer
and
cost
as
much
as
possible
ascertained
customer
by
customer
and
merely
lumped
on
certain
general
purposes
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
in
respect
to
some
of
the
classifications
which
were
imposed
merely
for
convenience
of
competition
and
do
not
represent
any
policy
of
classification.
there's
no
evidence
of
any
policy
of
classification
of
customers
nor
was
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
cost
study
was
predicated
upon
justifying
only
between
classes.
the
cost
study
not
only
justifies
customer
by
customer
but
provides
the
facts
by
which
the
reasonableness
of
any
classification
inherent
in
the
facts
as
they
appear
in
this
record,
may
be
tested,
were
tested
by
the
district
court
and
may
be
seen
by
this
court
for
reasons
that
i
will
outline
tomorrow
to
have
been
entirely
reasonable.
now,
on
this
cost
--
this
prima
facie
case
being
given,
a
cost
study
was
presented
because
we
have
to
cost
justify
the
discount
schedule
shown
in
the
prima
facie
case
with
regard
to
these
four
classes
of
independents
which
was
part
of
the
government's
claim
of
discrimination,
a
part
of
now
they
do
not
mention
at
all.
we
also
had
the
problem
of
cost
justifying
the
five
and
a
half
to
cartman.
if
various
reasons
the
government
stipulated
that
the
cartman
did
--
(inaudible)
and
schubert
discounts
of
five
and
a
half
would
not
be
used
as
evidence
of
violations
of
the
act
that
was
stipulated.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
may
it
please
the
court.
to
sum
up
what
i've
covered
yesterday,
the
issues
in
this
case
were
not
those
raised
by
the
1953
evidence,
but
by
the
new
prima
facie
case
that
was
presented
in
1955.
second,
this
prima
facie
case
required
borden
to
do
two
things,
first,
cost
justify
the
general
discount
schedule
volume
class
against
volume
class;
and
second
costs
justify
the
special
discounts
to
a&p
and
to
jewel
against
those
granted
the
eight
independent
stores
listed
by
the
government.
now,
these
issues
were
never
broadened.
the
counsel
for
the
government
in
the
trial
below,
for
example
attack
this
shows
at
record
93-94,
attacked
the
borden
cost
study
because
it
was
made
and
i
quote,
“after
the
particular
costumers
had
been
--
who
have
been
discriminated
against,
have
been
singled
out
by
the
government”.
it
was
these
eight
particular
stores
that
were
shown
to
be
in
commerce
and
in
competition
with
each
other.
and
this
is
exactly
the
prima
facie
case
that
judge
camel
described
at
record
page
563
were
he
summarizes
the
evidence
as
follows,
that
the
sales
made
by
the
defendants
were
in
commerce,
that
the
defendants
discriminated
in
price,
that
the
costumers
or
defendants
were
in
competition
with
each
other.
in
reference,
it
was
only
made
to
the
showing
with
respect
to
the
eight
independent
stores
and
the
five
stores
of
a&p
and
jewel
and
that
there
may
be
an
injury
to
competition.
he
also
found
that
the
published
discount
quotations
on
their
fees
showed
discrimination,
and
that
is
between
the
volume
class
against
volume
class.
now,
borden
having
the
13
stores,
selected
by
the
government
before
it,
then
made
its
cost
study
in
defense,
because
the
discounts
to
a&p
and
the
jewel
were
based
on
total
sales
to
all
of
those
stores
in
the
area.
and
because
we
have
to
justify
the
volume
classes
--
volume
class
against
volume
class
on
the
published
discount
schedule,
it
was
necessary
to
make
it
an
inclusive
study.
this
was
done
in
this
way,
time
study
man
were
placed
for
one
week
on
each
of
the
trucks
on
each
of
the
134
wholesale
routes
operated
in
the
chicago
area,
where
that
i
mean
the
routes
that
serviced
primarily
grocery
stores
although
they
have
discovered
small
restaurant
and
some
other
costumers.
now,
the
time
spent
by
the
drivers
on
the
routes
and
at
each
store
or
other
location
were
recorded
as
to
more
than
40
kinds
of
activities.
at
the
end
of
our
brief,
there
is
a
copy,
you
will
find,
of
sheets
that
are
photos
stand
--
these
are
the
actual
sheets
that
cover
the
time
study
records
made
with
respect
to
the
deliveries
to
the
shubert
store.
now
there
were
over
in
1900
locations.
there
were
four
sheets
of
--
of
which
this
is
the
set
of
four
for
this
one
location.
four
sheets
covering
the
week's
deliveries
to
not
more
than
1900
locations
and
the
covering
sheet,
covering
each
of
the
134
routes.
these
sheets
with
all
of
these
materials
became
bulk
exhibit
number
four,
that
was
over
8000
sheets
of
paper.
similar
studies
were
made
with
respect
to
the
special
deliveries
that
were
made.
those
are
recorded;
they
became
other
bulk
exhibit
number
six
of
that
case.
bulk
exhibit
number
five
was
the
tickets
made
for
each
delivery
which
again
was
a
very
bulky
exhibit.
all
of
these
and
then
cost
studies,
time
studies
were
also
made
of
clerical
activities
in
the
branches
and
in
four
different
departments
in
the
central
office.
all
of
these
--
these
documents
were
then
assembled
together
in
bulk
exhibits
and
bulk
exhibits
four
though
13
were
identified
and
became
part
of
the
record,
they
are
massive
in
character.
now,
in
addition
to
gathering
of
this
detailed
material,
a
stipulation
was
drawn
out
and
submitted
in
draft
form
to
the
government.
this
made
certain
information
out
of
the
accounting
records
of
the
company
available.
it
made
certain
error
for
medical
--
basic
error
for
medical
calculations
and
tabulations
from
the
basic
data.
and
it
also
contained
extensive
information
about
the
operations
of
the
various
borden
trucks
and
of
the
way
in
which
the
borden
company
conducted
its
business,
and
various
information
about
the
ways
in
which
various
of
the
costumers
conducted
their
business.
on
the
1950,
costumers
surveyed
in
this
way,
there
were
254
stores
of
a&p
and
jewel.
there
were
1322
independent
grocery
stores,
374
non-store
costumers
and
the
analysis
was
complete
so
that
with
the
information
in
the
stipulated
sheets
in
the
stipulation
with
the
basic
data
in
this
bulk
exhibits,
a
cost
analysis
could
be
made
costumer
by
costumer,
including
the
non-store
costumers.
in
other
words,
costumer
by
costumer
for
1950
costumers
and
all
of
these
--
all
of
these
basic
data
is
in
the
record.
now,
the
--
as
i've
said,
you
can
find
out
from
this
basic
data
the
direct
cost
of
sales
and
delivery
to
each
costumer
on
the
costumer
by
costumer
basis.
you
have
in
the
descriptions
of
the
operations
the
rational
basis
by
which
measures
can
be
fixed
and
selected
by
which
indirect
cost
can
be
divided
in
accordance
with
sound
accounting
principles.
you
can
also
tabulate
from
that
the
total
cost
of
sale
and
delivery
to
entire
groups
of
costumers
such
as
those
within
the
four
discount
brackets
in
the
published
discount
schedule.
and
you
also
have
available
in
this
massive
material
in
the
record,
the
facts
showing
whether
any
group
was
properly
classified
together,
whether
they
have
dissimilar
characteristics
in
fact.
now,
all
of
this
data
was
in
the
record
and
made
available
to
the
government.
the
document
was
treated
as
if
it
were
the
direct
testimony
of
mr.
malone
under
whose
supervision
the
study
was
made,
and
it
was
verified
by
haskins
and
sells.
mr.
malone
was
then
offered
to
the
government
for
cross-examination.
all
of
the
materials
that
they
asked
from
malone
both
factual
and
questions
about
details
of
operation
were
then
added
and
added
paragraphs
to
the
stipulation
which
are
identified
in
the
record
with
the
letter
md
meaning
malone
deposition.
but
the
deposition
dropped
up
because
all
of
the
material
that
the
government's
request
was
included
in
the
stipulated
material.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
the
stipulation
here
begins
at
page
119
of
the
record
and
runs
to
226
covering
all
of
this
material.
that
was
then
finally
embodied
and
signed
by
the
court
on
september
19th,
1957
as
a
pre-trial
order,
and
that
is
the
one
that
identified
the
bulk
exhibits.
now,
i
want
to
stress
the
fact
that
all
of
this
data
was
available,
because
so
much
of
the
government's
criticism
is
based
on
theoretical
instances,
hypothetical
costumers,
not
on
actual
costumers
and
they
make
assumptions
about
hypothetical
questions
that
are
contrary
to
the
facts
that
are
shown
with
respect
to
the
actual
costumers
in
the
record.
now,
in
presenting
this
case
to
the
district
court,
the
material
was
summarized
in
the
form
of
four
summary
schedules.
you
have
two
kinds
of
costs
those
that
are
very
direct
and
assignable
on
time
or
other
direct
basis.
you
also
have
in
accounting
what
you
may
call
direct
or
joint
costs.
and
the
problem
there
is
to
allocate
by
selecting
a
proper
measure
of
allocation.
and
incidentally,
the
best
statement
of
all
the
principles
applicable
is
in
this
cost
justification
study
which
is
in
this
record
which
was
prepared
by
a
committee
appointed
by
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
chairman
of
which
and
two
members
were
the
three
experts
that
the
government
used
in
the
case
below.
and
those
experts
were
on
--
by
the
statement
of
the
deposition
of
mr.
willy
are
shown
to
have
been
picked
by
the
government
after
a
counsel
and
mr.
willy
their
economist
went
to
the
federal
trade
commission
and
these
were
pointed
out
as
the
best
witnesses
they
could
have.
i
think
that
gives
some
validity
to
the
cost
justification
study
and
points
that
in
following
that,
we
followed
the
best
authority
for
one
due
that
we
could
possibly
have.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
now
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
yes.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
the
government
is
trying
to
force
a
general
legal
issue
on
the
spec
setting
that
doesn't
support
or
raise
that
issue.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
we
have
a
special
set
of
facts,
the
only
problem
is
whether
the
special
discounts
granted
to
two
costumers,
a&p
and
jewel,
were
shown
to
be
cost
justified
as
against
the
specific
costumers
selected
by
the
government
and
whether
the
classes
in
the
quantity
discount
schedule
generally
available
were
justified
one
against
the
other.
and
there
is
no
general
principle
involved.
it's
a
pure
question
of
factual
justification.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
well
it's
limited
--
it's
--
it
is
not
limited,
it's
limited
by
the
nature
of
the
factual
limits.
there
was
no
policy
of
selecting
chain
stores
as
a
class;
there
was
no
policy
of
limiting
independents.
the
question
of
other
delimits
--
the
independents
were
so
limited
never
arose.
and
so
i've
pointed
out
the
record
shows
that
at
the
eight
stores
select
--
the
eight
independent
stores
selected
by
the
government,
the
three
largest
independent
stores
got
more
than
the
schedule.
they've
got
5
1/2%
as
against
the
8
1/2%
given
to
the
a&p
and
jewel.
the
record
is
completely
silent
because
the
government
never
asked
how
many
other
stores
--
independent
stores
receive
special
discounts,
or
what
the
amount
was.
the
record
is
completely
silent
as
to
whether
they
were
or
were
not
independent
stores
had
gathered
much
as
the
a&p
and
jewel
store.
that
is
why
the
record
doesn't
raise
the
question.
there
is
no
showing
that
borden
ever
intended
to
place
a
ceiling
upon
the
discount
available
to
any
independent
on
the
face
of
this
record.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
that
is
the
issue
raised
by
the
prima
facie
case
submitted
by
the
government.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
the
pleadings
do
not
limit,
the
pleadings
were
filed
in
1951.
this
case
after
remand
was
reopened
at
the
government's
request
and
then
the
government
submitted
as
their
case
a
selection
of
13
stores.
and
they
limited
their
prima
facie
case
and
that
was
so
regarded
all
the
way
through
as
a
question
of
justifying
those
13
store
discounts
between
each
other.
and
that
is
the
way
the
prima
facie
case
and
i
assume
that
when
you
go
to
trial,
the
issue
as
framed
by
the
way
that
the
government
presents
its
evidence
is
the
issue
by
which
--
which
you
are
called
upon
to
meet.
we
never
undertook
to
meet
a
broader
issue
nor
was
any
broader
issue
ever
raised
by
the
facts.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
i
don't
think
that
it
was
ever
intended
if
the
court,
if
justice
black
please,
i
don't
think
it
was
ever
intended
when
the
government
presented
this
prima
facie
case
to
raise
any
broad
issue
such
as
is
now
raised
in
the
court
here.
i
think
the
government
said
“we
have
a
burden
of
showing
differences
of
prices
which
is
the
burden
upon
the
government
under
the
act.
we
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
those
costumers
receiving
these
different
prices
and
they
could've
selected
two
costumers
or
10.”
we
have
merely
the
burden
of
showing
that
those
customers
are
in
competition
that
this
different
surprise
on
the
face
of
it
indicates
a
difference
or
discrimination
that
they
are
in
competition
with
each
other
so
that
there
could
be
the
likelihood
of
an
injury
to
commerce.
that
is
what
the
government's
prima
facie
case
is
under
the
literal
and
undisputed
meaning
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
section
2
(a).
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
i
would
--
i
think
the
pre-trial
order
which
embodied
the
stipulations
with
the
two
schedules
of
costumers
which
the
government
selected
had
exactly
the
effect
that
you
have
suggested.
it
was
an
answer;
it
was
a
narrowing
of
the
issues
by
a
judge
who
is
very
conscious
in
the
extended
trials
of
trying
to
reduce
the
issues
to
the
simplest
issues.
and
the
government
stipulated
its
case
just
as
if
it
had
defined
its
case
by
a
motion
for
bill
of
particulars
or
answers
interrogatively.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
that
was
not
the
purpose,
and
it
was
expressly
stated
in
the
reports
to
congress,
of
the
senate
and
the
house
report.
because
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
the
passages
from
those
two
reports
that
said
that
“nothing
in
this
act
is
intended
to
prevent
a
seller
from
passing
on
to
a
list
of
people
including
mass
distributors
others
buying
in
groups
and
the
rest
of
it
the
benefits
of
the
economies
produced
by
mass
buying
and
mass
distribution.”
and
there
is
a
passage
both
in
the
house
report
and
the
senate
report
to
that
effect
and
congressman
utterback
who
was
the
floor
manager
in
the
house
for
the
act
--
bill
expressly
again
referred
that
“nothing
in
this
act
was
intended
to
prevent
those
economies
which
result
from
mass
buying
from
being
passed
on
so
that
the
public,
the
consuming
public
can
get
the
benefit.”
the
cost
proviso
was
inserted
to
benefit
the
ultimate
consumer,
and
as
congressman
utterback
said,
“it
is
intended
to
permit,
to
be
passed
on
to
the
ultimate
consumer
any
economy
no
matter
how
produced
by
differences
of
method
in
which
businesses
are
conducted.”
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
yes.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
yes.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
oh,
yes.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
well,
i'm
--
i've
been
have
misstated
the
case.
we
published
one
schedule
only,
one
discount
schedule
that
said
to
all
stores
in
different
volume
branch,
we
will
give
you
no
discount,
we
will
give
you
2%,
we
will
give
you
3%,
we
will
give
you
4%,
that
was
the
only
published
discount
schedule,
the
only
discount
policy
or
system.
now,
over
and
above
the
published
discount
schedule
more
than
individually
gave
certain
costumers
special
discounts.
the
a&p,
jewel
t
and
of
the
list
of
eight
independents
selected
by
the
government,
three
of
them
the
three
largest
also
got
discounts
in
excess
of
the
maximum
provided
in
the
schedule.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
the
exact
reason
why
these
discounts
were
granted
to
the
special
costumers
was
undoubtedly
a
combination
of
i
think
this
is
the
fair
inference
from
the
facts,
a
combination
of
two
things
of
volume
and
of
the
economies
due
to
the
method
by
which
the
milk
could
be
delivered
to
these
costumers.
now,
the
--
you
see
there
were
two
costumers
had
254
of
the
stores
out
of
the
--
roughly
1600
or
1700
independent
stores.
those
two
costumers'
aggregates
purchases
to
those
stores
were
twice
the
dollar
aggregate
of
the
1900
or
1800
whatever
the
figure
is
of
the
independent
stores
in
tony.
the
schubert
store
which
there
is
a
great
view
--
are
talked
about
in
the
government's
brief
was
as
the
record
shows
not
the
record
brought
up
to
the
court
by
but
the
portions
that
we
have
checked
for
this
purpose
from
the
bulk
exhibits
that
the
schubert
store
was
by
far
and
away
the
largest
independent
in
volume.
the
volume
of
schubert,
the
volume
of
the
chain
stores
combined
was
190
times
the
volume
of
the
schubert.
the
schubert
store
--
the
counsel
made
the
statement
if
there
were
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
what?
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
that's
one
store.
we
have
no
policy
of
classifying
chain
stores
or
such.
it
happened
that
we
only
had
two
costumers
in
the
chicago
area
were
one
more
than
one
store
was
operated
under
a
common
management.
those
two
costumers
were
a&p
and
jewel.
that
was
the
happenstance
of
the
study.
there
wasn't
the
classification
of
chain
stores
was
not
a
classification
ever
published
or
announced
anywhere.
it
happened
that
these
two
special
discounts
in
the
same
amount
happened
to
be
given
by
independent
separate
arrangements
to
the
two
costumers.
now,
hence
where
the
so-called
classification
of
chain
stores
came
up,
they
accuses
of
pacifying
costumers
irrespective
of
volume,
they
accuses
of
classifying
costumers
because
of
the
form
of
ownership,
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
so
that's
what
we
did.
the
evidence
is
that
we
took
these
two
costumers.
a&p
was
75
times
the
volume
of
the
largest
independent,
jewel
was
120
times
the
volume
of
the
largest
independent,
we
took
these
two
costumers
and
we
gave
them
a
discount.
now,
there
are
other
factors
that
were
economic
in
selling
those
two
costumers.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
are
the
--
the
only
ones
that
the
record
showed
got
8
1/2%
but
the
record
did
not
go
into
what
other
special
discounts
there
might
have
been
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
i
test
--
i
can
tell
to
the
court,
although
it's
not
in
the
record
unless
it's
hidden
somewhere
in
the
sales
tickets
that
i've
not
check.
there
were
other
independent
stores
getting
other
special
discounts.
how
many
they
were
and
what
those
discounts
were,
i
do
not
know.
it
never
was
inquired
into
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
what's
that?
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
i
do
not
know,
i
doubt
of
any
of
them
got
8
1/2%
because
there
were
economists
inherent
and
certain
things
with
respect
to
the
chain
store.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
yes.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
yes.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
it
varies
in
communities.
i
am
in
a
federal
trade
commission
case
representing
borden;
i
know
instances
in
some
communities
where
somebody
as
independents
get
as
more
as
much
or
more
than
of
that
a&p
or
the
other
chains
get
because
of
their
volume
in
the
particular
circumstances.
but
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
the
circumstance
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
yes.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
that's
right
and
you
see
here
were
you
have
--
now
if
you
have
a
community
in
which
you
have
three
a&p
stores
and
you
have
one
store
and
i
know
of
a
situation
where
the
one
store
in
that
community
got
more
milk
than
the
three
a&p
stores
combined,
and
it
gets
a
bigger
discount.
now,
those
are
the
--
because
in
that
there
were
no
economies
and
mass
buying.
here
you
have
254
stores
which
the
contacts
in
selling
were
altogether
at
the
joint
buying
level.
little
executive
time
even
if
you
charged
it
all,
it
was
be
de
minimis,
we've
got
the
exact
figure
stated
in
out
brief.
however,
in
order
to
solicit
the
1800
and
some
independent
stores,
we
have
a
force
of
about
30
what
we
call
salesmen
and
solicitors
who
were
pounding
the
streets,
whose
time
was
devoted
to
the
independents.
now,
the
record
shows
and
i'm
going
to
cover
this
now
because
this
was
a
point
that
was
raised
in
allocation
yesterday
and
i
want
to
explain
how
you
find
this
cost.
it
is
obvious
that
for
the
week,
the
$2000
that
was
spent
in
salesman
and
solicitor's
time,
none
of
it
could
be
charged
against
these
chain
stores
all
had
to
go
against
the
independents.
now,
it
would
have
been
possible
to
have
made
a
time
study
of
saying
what
stores
those
men
spent
their
time
in.
but
unlike
deliveries
where
weeks
are
repetitious
and
the
week
can
be
a
proper
sample,
you
would've
had
to
take
a
month
to
two
or
three
months
of
time
studies
of
those
salesmen
to
balance
out
and
find
where
they
spent
their
time.
now,
these
men
were
not
only
salesmen.
the
sales
work,
and
it's
all
described
in
the
stipulation
covered
a
number
of
activities.
they
covered
what
we
called
maintaining
the
accounts.
they
went
into
the
stores,
they
listened
to
the
stores
complaints,
they
checked
on
the
kind
of
service
that
was
being
given,
they
put
the
in
store
promotions
in
the
right
place,
they
delivered
the
point
of
sale
material
and
so
that
was
mounted,
they
made
helpful
suggestions
to
the
sales
of
the
store.
now,
we
have
that
2000
is
a
cost
that
we
bore
with
respect
to
independents
and
not
with
respect
to
chains.
it
would
have
been
possible
to
solicit
by
sending
the
president
of
the
division
around
to
visit
the
1800
independent
stores
and
there
would've
been
no
point
in
having
these
salesmen
calls
on
the
managers
of
the
a&p
and
jewel
stores
who
had
no
right
to
buy.
so
there
have
to
a
difference
in
dealing
right
at
that
point.
now,
this
2000
a
week,
mr.
solomon's
last
point
yesterday
was
that
he
had
found
out
that
we
have
allocated
that
he
thought
improperly.
may
i
call
attention
to
the
study
of
page
--
opposite
page
13
in
the
brief
which
is
the
summary
of
our
brief,
yes
in
borden's
brief,
its
opposite
page
13
and
it
folds
out.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
most
likely
to
it.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
--(voice
overlap)
--
this
study
at
that
time.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
in
the
stipulation
which
i
have
referred
to,
in
connection
with
the
cost
study,
it
was
stipulated
that
mr.
malone
in
charge
of
this
study
and
who
was
the
district
comptroller,
had
participated
in
a
number
of
cost
studies
in
different
communities
including
two
made
in
the
chicago
area,
which
had
been
made
prior
to
this
discount
schedule,
and
which
gave
to
the
management
general
information
and
specific
in
certain
respects
with
regard
to
the
differences
of
cost
between
different
types
of
stores.
now,
there
--
i
was
not
--
i
do
not
have
the
details
of
those
studies,
whether
in
that
material
there
would
have
been
enough
to
study
them
store-by-store,
i
don't
know.
but
the
point
that
had
brought
it
is
that
the
general
characteristics
of
different
types
of
stores
have
been
studied
and
the
cost
difference
is
made
before
the
discount
schedule
was
given.
now,
this
is
the
same
problem
of
whether
you
have
post
litigation
justification,
the
cost
justification
study
and
here
is
a
--
of
course
the
bowman
and
the
borden
situations
here
are
entirely
different
or
a
cost
studies
were
independently
but
not
overlapped
here
on
different
theories
and
the
details
are
entirely
different.
to
a
certain
extent,
they
had
a
pre-justification
study.
we
only
have
ready
to
submit
the
post
litigation
study.
discount
schedules
in
these
situations
changed
from
year
to
year,
sometimes
from
month
to
month
in
a
community.
it
would
--
when
it's
figured
that
this
study
cost
is
over
50,000
to
mean,
it
is
obvious
impossible
that
every
time
you
shift
it
made
different
discount
arrangements.
and
every
time
you
shift
to
new
schedule,
you're
not
going
to
spend
50,000
in
a
community
and
make
a
cost
study
to
find
out
just
what
that
discount
schedules
will
be.
management
operates
on
good
common
sense.
now,
the
problem
comes
up
if
you're
in
litigation
you
have
to
justify
it.
the
experts
called
by
the
government,
the
cost
justification
study
itself
says,
“post
litigation
studies
are
perfectly
accurate
because
you
can
draw
the
--
you're
always
dealing
in
a
lawsuit
with
what
the
cost
justification
study
calls
historical
costs.”
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
it
would
--
the
facts
about
schubert
being
the
largest
independent
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
--
were
well
known
to
the
management
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
--
because
they
were.
now
let
me
distill
the
facts
about
the
schubert
store,
because
they
have
all
occurred
in
these
documents.
and
these
--
these
are
does
away
with
this
myth
that
there
are
in-store
services
that
an
independent
can
dispense
with.
even
chain
stores
got
all
of
the
services
to
some
extent,
a
man
has
to
walk
in
and
put
the
milk
somewhere,
whether
he
goes
farther
in
one
case
and
another
depends
in
a
various
store-by-store.
there
are
over
40
of
these
time
factors
each
representing
what
the
government
wants
to
follow,
in-store
or
service.
these
40
activities
that
were
performed
vary
in
time
individually.
but
there
are
certain
out
of
the
permutations,
there
are
certain
general
characteristics
that
are
inherit
in
the
nature
of
an
independent
business.
now,
let
me
take
schubert,
if
you
will
look
at
the
sheets
at
the
back
here,
you
will
find
on
the
third
sheet,
no
the
second
sheet
a
little
diagram
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
what's
that?
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
at
the
back
of
the
borden
brief
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
this
is
at
the
very
end
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
--
of
the
borden
brief.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
we
have
attached,
as
an
appendix,
these
three
sheets
covering
--
the
four
sheets
covering
schubert.
now,
in
the
second
of
those
fold
out
sheets,
you
will
see
a
diagram
of
the
store
arrangements,
you
will
also
see
that
there
is
indicated
up
above
the
fact
that
he
have
both
--
he
have
two
again,
this
is
under
item
76,
he
had
a
display
case
and
a
walk-in
cooler.
the
walk-in
cooler,
the
entrance
was
at
item
number
one
on
the
diagram,
the
displayed
case
at
17,
and
the
walk-in
cooler
at
12.
and
in
this
case,
these
independents
generally
operate
the
store
at
--
the
owner
had
his
brother
running
this
huge
store
and
it
was
huge
for
the
quantity
of
milk.
this
store,
if
you
will
also
notice,
had
a
very
peculiar
situation.
this
was
a
split
stops
that
means
if
this
store
like
most
independents
had
two
dairies
in
it,
which
meant
that
there
was
a
problem
of
display
--
relative
display
of
two
milks.
in
the
chicago
area,
there
were
no
split
stops
among
the
chain
stores
that
we
certain.
so
this
is
a
characteristic
difference
between
independents.
now
in
this
case,
there
was
20
feet
from
the
entrance
to
the
display
case,
50
feet
from
the
entrance
to
the
walk-in
cooler.
this
store
was
served
six
days
this
is
also
shown
in
this
--
and
it
also
shows
that
there
were
11
stops
which
meant
that
the
truck
have
to
come
almost
twice
a
day
to
the
store.
the
average
stops
for
each
a&p
and
jewel
store,
the
average
was
only
nine
and
a
half.
this
required
more
stops
of
the
regular
truck
to
service
this
store.
schubert
required
more
stops
of
the
regular
truck
per
week
than
the
average
of
the
80
largest
independents
which
involve
a
lot
of
intangible
as
well
as
tangible
cost,
all
of
these
being
known.
also,
you
will
notice
on
the
first
sheet
under
item
63
that
on
five
different
days,
they
have
to
call
for
special
deliveries
of
milk
in
addition
to
these
11
irregular
calls.
the
record
at
194
shows
that,
all
of
the
254
chain
store
locations
and
the
aggregate
required
only
99
special
deliveries
that
the
80
largest
independents
only
required
27
and
this
store
took
five.
now
again,
you
conceive
the
services,
this
was
a
large
split
stop
having
two
kinds
of
dairies
in
there,
the
frequency
of
delivery
and
all
of
these
factors
came
up.
there
--
you
would
see
that
that
effect
is
not
only
the
direct
labor
cost
of
the
time
area
but
the
indirect
burden
of
the
special
delivery
trucks
which
are
expensive
to
operate
and
the
trucks
going
back.
now
what
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
all
of
the
special
discounts
that
went
above
the
published
schedule
or
manners
of
individual
negotiation.
schubert
was
an
individually
negotiated
discount
based
on
his
pitch
to
the
borden
company
of
what
he
could
accomplish
or
how
he
could
handle
it.
now,
those
things
have
to
be
studied.
now,
there
was
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
no,
the
general
studies
reveal
this
kind
of
facts
about
stores
not
about
schubert
individually
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
--
but
about
these
types
of
stores.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
yes.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
the
government
tries
to
discount
this
whole
5
1/2%
on
the
ground
that
we
did
have
faced
with
this
problem
on
the
prima
facie
case.
one,
as
mr.
solomon
pointed
out,
one
of
the
special
discounts
was
to
a
store
that
only
got
approximately
more
than
one
who'd
only
got
4%.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
no
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
--
and
i
would
explain
why.
we
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
they
were
or
not,
we
were
prepared
to
present
as
to
those
three
stores
a
second
defense
a
cost
defense
and
a
meeting
competition
to
that.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
the
matter
of
fact
is
part
of
the
reason
that
you
give
special
discounts
is
that
the
independent
comes
to
you
and
wants
more
money
and
he
uses
everything
including
competitive
office.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
that's
right,
including
the
fact
used
a
split
stop.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
no.
not
in
chicago
this
time,
there
were
no
split
stops
in
the
a&p
and
jewel
stores.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
they
did
not
have
their
own
brand.
there
were
only
borden
milk
in
those
stores.
now,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
at
that
time
there,
the
stands
to
reason
that
if
they
want
more
discount
and
borden
feels
competitively
you
want
to
give
him
and
borden
could
suggest
to
them.
and
this
is
the
answer
i
think
to
the
basic
inquiry,
it
stands
to
reason
borden
have
no
policy
against
giving
special
discounts
to
independent
stores
and
no
limit
as
to
the
amount
that
they
would
give.
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
they
did.
the
answer
about
it
is
it
stands
the
reason
that
if
borden
people
could
make
suggestions
to
the
independent
as
to
how
he
can
operate.
remember
that
borden
more
than
makes
the
difference.
this
cost
study
show
that
on
--
as
you
go
out,
the
over
justification
tends
to
increase
rather
than
decrease.
so,
from
the
economy
of
borden
operation,
there
was
every
incentive
for
borden
to
suggest
to
this
man
here
is
the
way
you
can
reduce
our
cost
and
i
think
you
will
have
to
assume
that
from
that,
the
inference
can
be
drawn
that
if
it
had
been
possible
for
the
independents
to
do
these
things
the
problem
would've
been
offered
to
them,
and
they
would
have
been
given
the
discount.
there's
nothing
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
the
cost
factor
was
definitely.
schubert,
the
volume
was
definitely
a
factor.
he
was
the
biggest
independent
we
have
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
the
record
does
not
show
the
occasion.
we
were
prepared
to
show
that
as
a
second
defense.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
the
government
stipulated
they
weren't
going
to
make
a
battle
over
the
difference
between
5
1/2
and
4.
therefore,
we
never
introduced
any
evidence
in
the
record
is
cited
as
to
whether
we
did
or
did
not
need
to
do
it
for
that
purpose.
the
fact
is
that
we
are
prepared
to
justify
on
both
grounds
if
we
had
to
do
it.
now,
to
sum
up,
i
could
--
i
don't
know
just
what
mr.
solomon
may
want
to
point
out.
well,
i
want
to
cover
this
matter
of
the
allocation
of
salesmen's
time.
the
cost
justification
study
points
out
that
you
do
not
even
on
matters
on
your
subject
to
exact
measurement,
have
to
do
that
if
the
cost
is
great
if
there
are
other
measures
that
are
equally
accurate
by
which
you
can
divide
the
time
up.
in
our
various
accounts,
the
salesman
time
was
allocated
between
independent
stores
for
the
salesman's
cost
on
the
basis
in
proportion
to
their
volume
purchased
on
the
ground
that
the
salesman
would
be
in
the
store
like
schubert.
with
a
split
stop
with
the
problem
of
getting
borden
milk
in
a
maximum
display,
he
would
probably
be
there
in
that
store
far
more
often
than
he
would
in
the
average
store
and
in
really
direct
proportion
or
more
to
the
amount
of
volume.
so
volume
which
is
--
and
i
can
--
we
can
--
the
use
of
volume
and
all
that
was
--
is
justified
by
several
bits
of
the
testimony
of
the
expert
witnesses.
volume
was
a
perfectly
proper
measure
by
which
a
cost
may
be
spread.
these
costs
were
spread
of
solicitor's
time
on
that
basis
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
excuse
me
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
yes
and
thank
you
very
much.
i
wanted
to
say
on
that
point
that
as
far
as
schubert
is
concerned,
if
you
will
turn
to
page
60
--
63
of
our
brief,
you
will
find
a
study
of
the
schubert
costs
in
which
we
take
the
direct
labor
on
the
route
man,
the
direct
labor
on
special
delivery.
and
then
we
have
allocated
the
indirect
--
direct
labor
accountant
for
about
two
thirds
of
the
cost
of
the
route
man's
time.
we
have
lift
the
other
third
follow
which
is
on
accounting
method
approved
in
--
by
the
government's
own
experts
under
many
circumstances
of
letting
indirect
cost
follow
direct
cost.
in
this
case,
we
have
let
wholesale
truck
cost
special
delivery
indirect
in
route
man's
indirect
labor
follow
the
direct
cost
in
proportion.
if
you
look
at
line
10,
you
will
find
that
either
was
schubert,
the
largest
independent
and
may
i
say
there
were
not
unique
independent
because,
counsel
said
there
were
five
others
beside
schubert
and
had
as
much
volume
as
the
average
a&p
store.
the
answer
is
there
is
only
one
other
store,
not
identified
because
not
part
of
the
eight,
that
have
a
volume
as
much
as
the
average
to
the
a&p
and
jewel
stores.
that
--
and
that
were
--
schubert
was
third
lower
in
volume
than
the
next
largest
store
and
on
the
selected
eight,
he
was
three
times
as
large
as
the
next
largest
store
in
the
selected
eight.
now,
if
you
look
at
line
10,
you
will
notice
a
cost
of
$7.21
just
on
delivery
cost
alone
on
this
allocation
to
the
a&p
and
jewel
and
$11.20
to
schubert
which
means
3.99
or
399
100s
of
a
percent
of
discount
difference
that
could've
been
justified
on
direct
cost
alone
forgetting
the
solicitor's
time.
when
you
look
at
these
others,
down
below
including
salesman
solicitor's
time,
you'll
find
a
cost
justification
an
excess
of
a
5%
difference
between
this
largest
of
the
independents.
now,
i
think
it's
the
very
inferential
that
the
cost
to
stores,
the
others
on
the
selected
list,
the
nearest
of
which
was
only
one
third
of
the
volume
of
schubert
were
fully
cost
justified.
i
want
to
submit
again,
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
record
that
borden
have
a
policy
of
favoring
chain
stores
and
we
are
looking
solely
at
the
economies
of
volume
and
the
economies
of
inherent
method
of
which
we've
describe
in
some
detail
and
given
the
figures
on
the
brief.
in
the
second
place,
the
argument
of
classification
if
you
have
to
define
as
counsel
wants
you
to
do
classes
on
them
that
you
have
to
show
as
to
each
member
of
the
class
get
a
subject
to
exactly
the
same
cost
factors
to
justify
the
entire
cost
difference
between
classes,
that
means
you've
got
to
have
a
cost
study
by
costumer-by-costumer
study
which
defeats
the
purposes
of
classification.
but,
if
you
are
required
to
have
that
under
the
act,
in
this
case,
the
borden
cost
study
mean
such
a
costumer-by-costumer
justification,
it
was
up
to
the
government
with
this
information
before
it
if
they
were
going
to
take
these
hard
examples
instead
of
dealing
with
hypothetical
cases
as
they
have
on
their
brief
to
demonstrate
that
there
were
independents
being
unfairly
treated.
they
made
no
such
demonstration.
by
giving
you
schubert
we
have
shown
i
think
that
that
demonstration
was
impossible
for
them
to
make.
there
wasn't
any
way
that
schubert
could
change
his
method
of
operation.
now
under
all
of
those
circumstances,
the
issues
in
this
case
are
not
a
broad
issue
of
law
as
the
government
would
like
to
have
you
believe,
it
is
that
whether
the
discriminations
covered
by
the
government's
prima
facie
case
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
justified
by
a
cost
study
that
was
as
exhaustive
and
detailed
as
any
that
have
been
submitted
and
a
cost
study
that
was
in
accordance
with
the
principles
that
have
been
recognized
by
the
decisions
of
the
federal
trade
commission
and
of
the
experts
called
by
the
government.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
certainly.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
yes.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
schubert's
volume
was
about
15%
more
than
the
average
delivery
to
the
a&p
and
jewel
stores
in
the
chicago
area.
but
even
with
that
--
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
yes.
mr.
stuart
s.
ball
no.
we
deliver
to
the
individual
stores.
the
answer
about
it
is
that
you
can
have
the
same
truck
delivering
in
the
same
way
to
all
kinds
of
stores.
but
the
time
taken
because
the
way
the
independents
operate
as
against
the
way
the
chain
stores
operate
and
much
of
that
inherent
in
the
nature
of
being
an
independent
work
shop
by
yourself
and
needing
certainly
help
but
you
can't
otherwise
get.
in
that,
it
causes
more
to
deliver
to
the
independent
store
getting
the
same
volume
with
the
chain
store
than
it
does
deliver
to
the
chain
store
and
the
cost
of
their
--
the
kind
of
cost
that
are
inherent
in
the
type
of
the
economies
that
congress
intended
to
be
preserved.
thank
you.
