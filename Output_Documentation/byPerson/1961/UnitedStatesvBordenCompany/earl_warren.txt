et

mr.
ball,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ball
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
may
i
ask
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
the
issue
are
you
when
the
government
agreed
that
the
issue
--
one
of
the
issues
here
is
whether
under
any
circumstances
the
independents
would
get
the
same
percentage
of
the
credit
that
the
chain
stores
do
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
--
it's
your
position
that
that
is
not
before
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
up
to,
8%
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
up
to
8
1/2%?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ball,
may
i
clear
up
just
one
matter
before
we
study
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
your
study
made
as
to
the
differential
in
these
accounts
that
you
gave?
was
the
--
when
you
decided
to
give
schubert
5
1/2%
as
you
say
it
is
in
some
other
independent
4%
and
the
chain
stores
8
1/2,
had
you
made
your
studies
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
that
wouldn't
what
i
asked
you.
i
was
asking
you
if
you
had
made
any
study
as
to
those
particular
stores
to
indicate
that
one
was
entitled
to
5
1/2%
and
other
4%
and
that
the
sale
--
and
that
the
chains
were
entitled
to
8
1/2%
depending
upon
the
economy's
effect.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
can
understand
that,
but
what
i'd
like
to
know
is
this,
did
you
have
enough
information
from
your
cost
studies
so
that
if
schubert
have
been
operating
exactly
as
a
chain
store,
if
schubert
had
dealt
directly
with
your
president
instead
of
your
salesmen,
and
if
it
required
no
more
services,
then
the
chain
stores
would
have
gotten
that
it
would
likewise
have
received
8
1/2%
discount
as
did
the
chain
stores.
and
would
it
--
and
would
you
have
recorded
to
it
8
1/2%?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
just
take
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
on
what
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
the
very
end
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ball,
that
would
lead
me
to
ask
this
question,
before
this
action
was
filed,
did
you
have
--
did
borden
have
any
formula
that
an
independent
might
be
able
to
meet
that
would
enable
it
to
get
the
same
discount
as
a
chain.
in
other
words,
if
it
so
condition
its
business
that
it
would
eliminate
these
things
that
you're
talking
about
to
the
same
extent
that
the
chain
stores
eliminated
these
costs
to
you,
could
it
--
could
it
by
such
elimination
obtain
this
8
1/2%?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
those
things
were
not
specially
studied
though
you
said?
i
thought
you
said
they
have
been
general
studies
and
observations
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ball
your
--
your
time
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
up
but
i'm
going
to
give
you
five
minutes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
more
to
conclude
what
you
want
and
you
may
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solomon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed,
mr.
solomon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stevens.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
were
those
largest
ones?
chief
justice
earl
warren
600
and
some,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
647.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
in
what
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
wouldn't
--
why
wouldn't
they
have
been
considered
in
this
because
there
the
various
stores
that
would
have
competed
with
the
--
for
the
chain
stores,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stevens,
you
may
continue
your
arguments.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
maximum
available
margin,
400?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stevens,
may
i
ask
you
if
before
this
complaint
was
filed
if
it
was
known
throughout
the
industry
and
particularly
among
the
independents
whether
they
could,
by
conforming
to
the
same
business
practices
in
the
same
volumes
of
purchases,
obtained
the
same
percentage
of
deduction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
put
out
any
bulletins
of
any
kind
on
prices?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
mean
to
the
general
public.
were
there
any
bulletin
--
price
bulletins
from
bowman
to
the
independents
generally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
at
discount
schedules,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
stops
at
400?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
--
was
there
anything
to
indicate
in
that
bulletin
that
you
put
out
that
--
that
--
the
--
although
the
chain
stores
got
11%
deduction
that
that
was
because
of
their
difference
in
doing
business
and
that
these
others
could
by
conforming
to
business
--
same
business
practices,
obtain
the
same
discount
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
i
understood
you
to
say,
that
that
was
the
fact,
did
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stevens,
if
you'd
like
five
minutes
more
to
sum
up,
you
may
have
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
--
take
it
off
your
time.
go
right
ahead.
you
may
have
five
minutes
too
mr.
solomon.

justice
earl
warren
