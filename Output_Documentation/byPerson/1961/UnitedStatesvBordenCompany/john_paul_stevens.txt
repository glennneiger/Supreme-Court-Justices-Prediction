mr.
john
paul
stevens
three
are
plenty
of
a&p
stores
about
45
kroger
stores.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
about
66,
67,
i
think
below
the
average.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
which
were
raised
by
the
bowman
cost
study
are
materially
different
from
those
raised
by
the
borden
study.
for
that
reason,
i
shall,
of
course,
be
talking
only
about
the
aspects
of
the
case
which
are
unique
as
to
bowman.
to
start
with,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
first
graduated
discount
schedule
which
bowman
put
into
effect
in
january
of
1953
which
is
found
at
page
311
or
the
record.
the
record
shows
that
the
time
studies
on
which
the
independent
cost
experts
employed
by
bowman
calculated
their
cost
curve
were
conducted
in
1949.
i
think,
i
thought
it
was
clear
in
the
district
court
that
there
is
no
dispute
over
the
fact
that
our
basic
cost
studies
had
anticipated
the
litigation
that
made
in
advance
and
the
cost
curves
were
subsequently
developed.
i
think
that
shown
in
the
colloquy
at
pages
97
and
98
of
the
record,
if
we
need
documentation
of
it.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
subsequently,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
of
course
our
specific
studies
of
march
1955
differentials
were
had
to
be
made
after
march
of
1955.
they
gave
a
specific
comparison
and
we
then
applied
the
principles
which
had
been
developed
previously
and
showed
the
cost
differentials
which
related
to
those
specific
price
differential.
those
studies
were
naturally
made
after
the
fact
because
they
are
based
on
actually
transactions.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
yes
sir.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
agree
with
the
statement
and
i
would
like
an
opportunity
to
explain
that
and
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
--
that
the
appropriate
point
i'm
trying
to
show
that
our
cost
study
specifically
differentiates
between
the
classes
of
stores
taking
extensive
delivery
services
which
include
for
the
most
part
independents
but
it
says
also
in
any
other
group
and
therefore
it
include
the
chain.
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
classes
of
stores
taking
the
less
extensive
delivery
services
which
are
simplified
by
the
chains
but
the
study
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
other
stores
met
that
standard,
it
would
fall
into
that
class
and
i
will
direct
your
honors
at
page
328
of
the
record.
it
is
said
in
so
many
words
that
that
is
the
differential.
so
i
violently
disagree
and
as
i
go
along
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
with
respect
to
the
actually
comparisons
which
were
made,
there
were
in
fact
these
differences
and
they
again
as
i
interpret
the
government's
position,
the
actual
cost
differences
fully
justify
the
actually
price
differences
which
have
been
shown.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
such
a
result
your
honor?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
i
would
agree
that
if
there
are
in
fact
two
stores
which
are
equally
costly
to
serve
and
if
my
client
adopted
the
policy
of
saying
you're
a
chain
and
i'll
give
you
a
better
discount
from
the
other
even
though
you
are
alike
in
all
respects,
i
would
agree
that
it
would
violate
the
statute.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
but
i
said
that
did
not
have
to
be.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
that
our
--
our
study
was
made
in
advance
and
that
the
arrangement
of
the
cost
is
such
that
in
any
store
regardless
of
whom
who
might
own
it
could
qualify.
and
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
as
i
go
along
that
i
think
government
counsel
doesn't
have
the
proper
respect
for
the
acumen
of
the
independent
businessman
who
run
these
stores
and
the
knowledge
which
they
have
of
the
cost
factors
which
are
involved.
unfortunately,
as
i
also
point
out,
the
record
is
thinner
than
i
would
like
on
this
point
because
it
is
a
point
which
is
really
being
argued
here
and
was
not
developed
during
the
trial.
but
i'd
like
to
bring
that
out
as
i
go
along.
we
are
somewhat
limited
by
the
record
we
have
because
of
the
manner
in
which
the
case
developed.
as
i
first
indicated
at
page
311
of
the
record
is
the
first
discount
schedule
which
bowman
put
into
effect
adopting
these
principles
and
it
was
put
into
effect
in
january
of
1953
about
a
month
after
the
entry
of
the
dean
decree
which
the
court
will
recall
judge
campbell
relied
on
when
the
case
was
previously
up
here.
probably
after
the
dean
decree
relying
on
the
time
studies
which
had
previously
been
made
bowman
adopted
it
dramatically
new
type
of
discount
schedule.
and
i
think
it's
significant
to
note
that
this
schedule
avoids
a
problem
which
is
frequently
present
in
classification
cases
of
whether
the
person
who
buys
99
points
and
gets
into
one
bracket
is
being
unfairly
treated
as
against
someone
who
buys
101
points
because
sometimes
you
get
a
sharp,
you
have
the
problem
of
drawing
the
line.
now,
we
don't
say
that
we
are
by
law
compelled
to
do
this,
but
i
say
that
we
were
advised
by
our
independent
experts
it
would
be
good
business
and
it
would
be
a
lawful
way
to
do
it.
so
that,
you'll
note
there
are
these
probably
40
different
would
appear
to
be
brackets
on
the
schedule.
but
even
within
the
schedule,
for
example,
if
you'll
note
between
210
and
220
points,
the
percent
of
discounts
is
6.1
to
6.2
which
in
turn
means
that
there
is
variation
even
within
that
range.
so
that
if
the
volume
was
increased
to
215,
for
example,
with
discount
would
have
been
6.15%
or
217,
6.17%
every
additional
quart
of
milk
because
of
the
paralleling
of
the
graduated
scale
would
cost
curve
entitled
the
customer
to
a
slightly
larger
discount.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
per
store.
per
store,
your
honor
and
i
might
say
that
our
entire
study
is
based
on
delivery
expenses,
based
on
individual
store
analysis
with
no
aggregation
of
different
units
because
--
simply
because
of
multiple
store
ownership.
that
doesn't
involve
in
our
case
at
all.
now,
this
is
significant
for
this
reason
which
i
think
goes
to
the
integrity
of
the
entire
system
and
i
also
would
like
to
say,
that
it
had
been
my
understanding
that
no
challenge
was
made
to
the
good
faith
our
system.
i
interpret
solomon
--
mr.
solomon's
remark
as
perhaps
suggesting
the
contrary,
but
it's
my
understanding
that
the
position
of
the
government
throughout
the
litigation
has
not
doubted
the
good
faith
of
the
manner
on
which
the
bowman
dairy
company
attempted
to
comply
with
the
law.
now,
the
reason
this
is
significant,
the
reason
i
want
to
stress
it
before
the
court
is
that,
bowman
had
hundreds
of
customers
and
it
is
almost
literally
true
that
every
customer
receive
a
different
net
price.
they
were
--
because
of
these
graduating
changes
and
discounts,
you
have
literally
hundreds
of
different
net
pricing
being
charged
to
the
bowman
customers.
and
therefore,
there
was
a
myriad
of
prima
facie
price
differentials
and
price
discriminations
which
was
incumbent
upon
bowman
to
be
in
the
position
to
justify.
and
with
respect
to
that
myriad
of
price
differentials
ranging
all
the
way
from
no
discount
at
the
very
bottom
level
all
the
way
up
to
8%
at
the
400
and
over
level
which
was
in
effect
at
this
time,
there
is
no
question
raised
by
the
government
as
to
the
integrity
or
validity
of
the
system
by
making
all
of
these
price
differentials.
the
case
which
is
presented
is
solely
relating
to
the
possibility
that
there
may
be
a
few
extremely
large
independents
who
should
have
got
an
even
larger
discount
which
would
have
made
them
exactly
equal
to
the
chains.
so
they
were
concerned
not
with
the
large
body
of
customers
served
by
bowman
but
rather
with
the
possibility
of
a
few
independents
who
have
been
denied
to
fair
opportunity
to
qualify
for
the
same
discount
as
a
chain.
and
i'll
try
and
show
that
they
have
been
denied
any
such
opportunity.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
as
i
said
your
honor,
if
the
cost
of
serving
them
were
the
same
as
the
cost
of
serving
a
chain,
you
could
not
--
unless
there
was
some
other
defense
under
the
statute
like
good
faith
meaning
of
competition.
if
the
costs
are
the
same,
certainly
the
price
has
to
be
the
same.
we
don't
dispute
that
in
the
slightest.
now,
so
our
discount
schedule
is
rather
dramatically
different.
we
believe
that
it's
the
kind
of
bracket
discount
schedule
which
is
usually
presented.
now,
i'd
also
like
to
show
the
prima
facie
case
which
the
government
developed
in
this
connection
and
again,
i
said
it
doesn't
matter
when
i
talked
about
the
prima
facie
case
whether
i'm
saying
they
proved
nine
stores
and
nine
price
differentials
or
whether
they
are
taken
as
illustrative
of
the
problem
as
a
whole
because
either
way,
we
met
their
case.
first
of
all,
bear
in
mind
that
this
schedule
went
into
effect
in
1953
and
after
this
court
remanded
the
cost
to
the
district
court,
on
january
11,
1955
the
government
moved
to
reopen
the
record
for
the
taking
of
additional
evidence.
and
the
court
granted
the
motion
and
advised
the
government
they
would
have
wide
latitude
in
presenting
such
case
as
they
needed.
i
might
say
parenthetically,
the
government
in
effect
abandoned
the
evidence
that
had
been
involved
before
which
related
to
many
years
previously.
the
case
really
started
all
over
as
a
new
lawsuit.
the
government
then
took
the
period
from
january
of
1955
to
november
of
1955
when
the
pre-trial
order
containing
their
prima
facie
case
was
stipulated
and
entered.
and
that
entire
prima
facie
case
is
found
at
the
record
and
the
record
beginning
at
page
57
and
it
runs
through
page
61
with
some
schedules
and
exhibit
attached
thereafter.
the
heart
of
the
case
is
in
the
two
schedules
on
pages
62
and
63.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
during
this
time,
the
government
at
an
ample
opportunity
to
select
stores
which
would
fairly
present
the
problem
which
they
felt
needed
to
be
presented
to
the
court.
and
what
kind
of
stores
did
they
select?
they
selected
two
delivery
routes,
each
of
which
contains
examples
of
chain
store
units
and
independents
store
units.
the
independents
as
it
would
be
natural
presenting
the
plaintiff
point
of
view
on
the
independents
in
which
they
particularly
rely
are
among
the
2%
of
the
largest
stores
served
by
bowman.
the
--
a
rebuttal
exhibit
put
in
subsequently
by
the
government
in
its
own
--
when
it
came
to
rebuttal
time
and
i
might
say
all
the
evidence
relating
to
average
cost
and
average
classification
is
the
government
rebuttal
exhibit
evidence,
our
evidence
is
not
based
on
any
kind
of
averaging
of
the
size
of
the
stores
or
anything
of
that
character.
the
stores
which
they
selected,
as
i
say,
excuse
me,
this
rebuttal
exhibit
shows
that
98%
of
the
independent
stores
purchase
less
than
200
points
per
day.
so
naturally,
they
selected
independents
which
purchase
in
excess
of
200
points
to
present
their
case.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
varies
from
time
to
time,
justice
stewart.
the
schedules,
the
different
schedules
which
have
been
in
effect
have
a
different
top
correct
it
might
presume
the
reason
for
that
is
it
varies
with
the
customers
then
being
served.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
the
one
on
311
goes
up
to
400
points.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
the
most
recent
one
i
believe
goes
to
355.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
the
one
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
the
case
was
brought
originally
went
to
150
and
then
there
was
an
amendment
on
page
68
carrying
it
up
to
200.
in
fact,
i
believe
although
the
record
doesn't
show
this
that
that
should
be
up
to
300
because
if
one
performs
the
arithmetical
calculation
in
the
bracket
between
150
and
300,
that
require
to
show
up
the
discount
should
have
been
for
charlie's
market
in
(inaudible)
and
the
record
on
page
62
and
63,
it
will
be
seen
that
the
discounts
granted
would
only
make
sense
if
the
top
bracket
were
300
obviously
there
is
typographical
error.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
that's
correct.
well,
this
is
the
discount
here.
i
should
answer
that
directly
right
now
i
believe,
your
honor.
there
is
no
purpose
in
publishing
a
discount
schedule
containing
brackets
in
which
no
one
falls.
and
a
logical
reason
for
stopping
is
this
is
the
group
of
customers
who
buy
pursuant
to
this
published
discount
schedule
distributed
throughout
the
markets.
and
these
particular
customers,
the
best
examples
the
government
could
find
in
the
chicago
area
and
i
might
point
out
the
government's
complaint
is
limited
to
chicago
area
as
specifically
defined.
i
assume
where
this
particular
stores,
i
would
assume
they
would
go
out
in
this
year
in
which
they
had
to
developed
their
case
and
find
the
biggest
stores
and
the
best
examples
to
support
their
position.
it
is
true
and
i
might
jump
ahead
a
moment
to
point
out
that
the
rebuttal
exhibit
which
was
put
in
three
years
later,
the
day
the
record
closed
identified
some
stores
purchasing
over
400.
but
it
doesn't
show
where
those
are.
and
that
rebuttal
exhibit
applies
to
the
entire
area
served
by
the
bowman
dairy
company.
it
is
not
confined
to
the
chicago
area
about
which
the
price
stipulations
and
other
stipulations
relate.
so
that
we
don't
know
on
the
basis
of
this
record
whether
there
is
a
single
additional
store
in
the
chicago
area
larger
than
those
identified
in
the
government's
prima
facie
case.
and
we
hadn't
--
there
were
just
not
an
opportunity
to
go
into
that
because
that
wasn't
considered
to
be
part
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
the
largest
ones
are
those
referred
to
on
the
exhibit
of
page
481,
i
believe
it
is,
of
the
record
mr.
chief
justice.
and
mr.
solomon
did
correctly
point
out.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
pardon.
that
there
were
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
there
were
two
stores
in
september
of
1955
whose
aggregate
purchases
the
two
stores
average
out
to
647.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
in
september
of
1955.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
honor
we
do
not
know
for
this
reason.
as
i
say
this
was
exhibit
was
put
on
the
record
the
day
that
the
case
was
close.
we
don't
know
whether
these
stores
are
within
the
area
described
in
the
complaint.
we,
therefore,
do
not
know
whether
they
were
charged
a
different
price
than
the
chain
stores.
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
what
price
these
stores
paid
or
what
discount
was
given
to
them.
the
record
does
show
that
all
large
stores
which
are
--
which
were
considered,
all
stores
over
the
160
points
level
way
down
the
line
took
the
customer
services.
so
there
is
a
cost
factor
which
differentiates
all
large
stores,
all
large
independent
stores,
from
all
large,
from
all
chain
stores.
so
we
have
two
points
of
doubt
here.
one,
i
assume
they
fall
into
the
category
of
those
that
took
the
customer
services
and
i
also
we
don't
know
what
their
prices
were.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
was
pointing
out
the
prima
facie
case
submitted
by
the
government
included
these
relatively
large
chains,
independent
stores.
it
also
included
examples
of
chain
store
units
which
were
smaller
than
the
average
chain
store
unit.
the
chain
stores
identified
in
the
case
were
those
purchasing
360
points
or
less.
the
rebuttal
exhibits
submitted
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding
showed
according
to
the
government's
calculations
that
the
average
chain
store
combining
them
altogether
purchased
approximately
500
points
so
that
their
case,
we
would
submit,
was
selected
for
the
purpose
of
putting
us
to
a
fair
test
of
justifying
this
price
differential.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
481,
mr.
justice
douglas
is
the
one
which
pertains
to
show
the
purpose
of
that
exhibit
as
the
title
will
show
us
to
show
the
relative
usage
of
glass
and
fiber
containers
by
independent
stores
and
then
on
the
second
page
482
pertains
to
chain
stores.
the
only
significant
figure
that
is
mentioned
in
that
entire
exhibit
now
is
the
one
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
column
on
482
where
the
totals
average
of
500.48
is
given
and
as
i
say
that's
a
government
calculation
of
from
data
which
they
had.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
yes,
your
honor.
we
do
may
take
that
position.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
but
we're
not
basing
on
a
classification
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
your
honor,
as
i
try
to
point
out
when
i
describe
the
discounts
schedules,
practically
every
store
we
serve
gets
a
different
price
so
that
we
have
the
--
we
run
the
risk
by
doing
that
on
being
put
to
the
test
of
comparing
any
two
stores
we
serve
because
practically
everybody
pays
a
different
price
with
this
continuous
sliding
scale
discount
so
that
we
feel
we
have
this
burden.
whenever
the
differentials
are
put
forward
as
to
our
system,
we
will
have
to
justify
the
particular
differentials
that
are
there.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
if
out
of
two
or
3000
stores
and
we
went
to
the
task
of
trying
to
justify
all
3000,
we
justified
2900
and
fail
to
justify
on100,
that
that
would
mean
the
whole
system
should
fail,
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
area
reasonableness
but
it
seems
to
me
your
honor,
that
the
government
or
the
plaintiff
should
have
the
burden
of
picking
examples
which
would
put
us
to
the
fair
cast.
if
they
want
to
predicate
their
case
on
the
assumption
that
somewhere
in
the
population
of
stores
which
we
serve,
there
is
an
independent
store
who
is
identical
to
a
chain
store
in
the
volume
which
he
purchases
and
in
the
methods
of
delivery
to
him.
there's
no
great
problem
in
there
identifying
that
store
and
putting
in
evidence
pertaining
to
that
store.
we
submit
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
your
honor
but
our
problem
is
just
what
classification
are
they
talking
about?
perhaps
i
should
address
myself
to
them
right
now.
they
suggest
that
the
classification
which
we
have
made
is
chains
versus
independents.
now,
it's
true
that
in
the
prima
facie
case
they
took
some
examples
of
independents
and
examples
of
chains
and
there's
frequent
talk
about
the
chain
stores
under
one
hand
and
the
independents
on
the
other,
it's
throughout
the
study,
but
that
is
not
the
principle
of
classification
which
is
laid
down
in
the
cost
study
and
may
i
direct
your
honor's
attention
to
page
200
and
--
i
believe
it's
78
--
no,
84
of
the
record
which
is
the
basic
description
of
the
bowman
costing
system
in
which
the
expert
suggest
in
comparing
the
two
classes
at
various
volume
levels
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
284,
the
full
paragraph
beginning
at
various
volume
levels.
calculate
the
maximum
available
margin
for
an
independent
store
(or
for
any
other
group
receiving
equally
extensive
delivery
services
so
that
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
your
honor,
the
margin
--
i
should
pause
to
explain
this
for
just
a
moment.
the
margin
is
the
margin
available
to
the
dairy
after
all
of
its
costs
have
been
incurred
in
performing
the
service
and
paying
for
the
milk
and
so
forth.
there's
a
margin
left
out
of
which
it
pays
its
overhead,
its
taxes
and
derives
a
profit
and
the
study
shows
that
if
the
margin
available
on
one
transaction
is
equal
to
the
margin
available
on
the
other
then
the
cost
would
be
--
necessarily
be
equal.
so
this
--
this
phrase
here
is
sort
of
stated
in
reverse
--
it's
a
--
but
the
margin
refers
to
the
profit
margin
i
might
say
although
that's
not
entirely
accurate,
so
that
you
calculate
the
margin
for
the
independent
or
anyone
else
receiving
the
extensive
delivery
services
and
this
is
done
at
each
volume
level
and
i
must
stress,
that
it
is
not
an
accurate
statement
that
bowman
relies
only
on
a
difference
in
method
of
delivery
that
the
method
and
the
volume
are
--
always
work
together.
the
method
--
there
are
separate
cost
course
and
affect
which
take
into
the
account
the
volume
differentials
and
also
the
method
differentials;
but
you
calculate
for
an
independent
store
any
other
group
will
be
receiving
equally
extensive
delivery
services
and
that
goes
on
in
a
chain
store
or
any
other
group
receiving
equally
limited
delivery
services
and
certainly
that
contemplates
that
if
another
store
was
--
did
not
take
the
more
expensive
form
of
delivery,
that
it
should
be
--
the
costing
would
be
the
same
as
per
chain
and
it
would
follow
the
price
should
be
the
same
so
that
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
that's
--
well,
the
procedure
which
is
set
up
your
honor.
we
don't
say
that
the
law
requires
store-by-store
classification
--
store-by-store
justification,
but
if
a
specific
case
is
--
a
specific
differential
is
called
to
our
attention
and
said,
you
must
justify
that.
it
would
seem
that
a
sufficient
justification
would
have
been
made.
if
you
have
showed
that
comparing
the
cost
as
between
those
two
stores,
you
can
justify
the
price
differential
and
it
is
true
this
procedure
makes
it
possible
to
calculate
on
a
store-by-store
basis
and
that
is
exactly
what
our
cost
study
did.
it
was
not
based
on
an
average
of
everyone
in
the
group
but
rather
the
cost
for
the
particular
stores
depending
on
his
particular
volume
and
the
particular
method
of
delivering
to
that
store;
so
that
it
is
--
the
procedure
does
permit
this
kind
of
defense
of
because
we
followed
that
i
don't
think
that
raises
the
legal
question
of
whether
we
had
to
be
that
detailed
but
we
thought
we
had
gone
just
as
far
we
could
possibly
be
required
to
go
in
defense
of
the
price
differentials
which
were
identified
by
the
government.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
honor
i'll
try
and
answer
that
question
as
directly
as
i
can.
first,
let
me
perhaps
correct
one
thought
that
i
see
in
the
question.
it
isn't
a
question
of
the
efficiency
of
the
store.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
seller
derives
efficiency
in
his
own
operation
by
means
of
the
method
of
delivery
to
the
store
and
perhaps
i
should
identify
where
in
this
cost-saving
lies.
the
customer
services
it
is
true,
include
different
elements
but
with
respect
to
the
large
doors
and
all
of
the
large
stores
the
evidence
shows
took
the
customer
services.
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
function
of
taking
the
milk
from
the
back
delivery
platform
and
placing
it
into
the
showcases
in
the
interior
of
the
store
and
rearranging
it
for
sale
the
next
day
where
they
put
the
milk
which
is
left
over
from
the
last
state
of
the
front
of
the
case
so
that'll
be
sold
first
and
adjust
the
merchandise
taking
anywhere
from
15,
20,
25
minutes
in
a
large
supermarket
for
the
milkman
to
do
this.
if
he
does
it
or
if
the
milk
driver
doesn't
do
it,
then
the
storekeeper
has
to
employ
his
own
personnel
to
perform
the
work
because
the
work
must
be
done.
it's
that
he
can't
just
dump
the
milk
off.
now,
there
is
quite
obviously
a
substantial
difference
in
the
time
required
to
make
the
delivery
if
the
milkman
goes
in
and
does
this
work
in
the
one
case
or
in
the
other
case
if
the
storeowner
says,
"no,
you
stay
out
of
my
store.
i
don't
want
you
parading
up
and
down
the
aisles
and
i
want
to
keep
the
aisles
free
for
the
customers.
i
want
it
do
have
that
done
by
my
own
personnel
and
i'll
absorb
that
cost
to
my
own
operation."
so,
the
cost
and
of
course
the
difference
in
the
time
he's
taking
to
do
it
affect
the
costs
to
delivery
per
unit.
now
so
--
i'm
trying
to
get
to
your
question.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
we
would
agree
and
i
intended
to
say
this
before
if
i
failed
to
so
we
would
agree
that
if
an
independent
used
the
less
costly
method
and
this
is
something
that's
obvious.
the
independent
knows
whether
he's
putting
a
milk
away
himself
or
whether
the
driver.
if
he
uses
the
less
costly
method
and
there
is
no
other
cost
saving
factor
present
and
our
study
doesn't
rely
on
any
others
except
differences
in
volume
and
this
point
and
the
relatively
minor
point
of
cash
collection
which
is
very
--
very
trivial
importance
in
the
large
stores.
if
he
uses
the
same
method
as
the
chains
and
buys
in
the
same
value
--
volume
under
our
study,
he's
entitled
of
the
same
price.
now,
i
can't
give
a
legal
opinion
on
whether
every
independent
would
always
be
entitled
to
it
because
some
other
dairy
might
have
other
cost
savings
that
we
don't
rely
upon.
our
study
does
not
go
into
the
savings
which
result
from
central
building
--
doing.
we
don't
analyze
the
central
office
savings.
we
merely
relied
on
the
savings
which
resulted
to
the
particular
units
in
the
delivery
methods
asked
of
them
together
with
the
increases
in
volume
asked
of
them.
i
hope
i've
answered
your
question
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
honor
our
study
is
prepared
for
that
kind
of
defense.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
that's
correct.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
no,
but
i
think
it
certainly
permits
that
kind
of
justification
because
certainly
it
is
a
more
complete
justification
than
a
classification
system
would
and
i
think
that
the
government
has
acknowledged
although
i
must
detect
some
inconsistency
in
their--
in
their
--
the
papers
they
filed.
i
think
they
have
acknowledged
that
classification
is
proper
and
that
we
perhaps
did
more
than
was
required
by
the
statute.
but
i
would
certainly
hope
that
going
too
far
would
not
prejudice
our
defense.
i
would
think
that
we
had
done
what
would
be
required
under
any
standards
of
cost
defense.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
our
defense
in
the
board
and
defense?
mr.
john
paul
stevens
no,
your
honor
i
would
not
think
they're
inconsistent.
i
would
they're
all
alternative
and
let
me
submit
why
i
believe
so.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
can
justify
an
individual
basis
you
don
t
reach
a
question
of
classification
but
it
could
well
happen
in
the
bracket
system
for
example,
that
somebody
of
the
99
point
level
gets
one
discount
and
somebody
at
the
101
point
level
gets
another
discount
and
if
you
couldn't
possibly
justify
on
an
individual
basis,
it
might
nevertheless
be
true
in
such
a
case
that
considering
all
the
problems
of
operating
a
large
business
that
this
was
a
reasonable
line
to
draw
and
that
therefore
you
should
permit
the
justification
on
a
class
basis
but
i
say,
we
don't
--
we
don't
reach
that
issue
in
our
case
but
--
i
would
feel
that
these
are
alternative
ways
of
defending
price
differentials
either
by
suggesting
classification
and
then
you
have
the
--
then
you
have
the
question
of
whether
the
classification
is
reasonable
but
we,
as
i
say
your
honor,
don't
have
that
question
because
we
have
justified
them
the
particular
differentials
which
have
been
identified
and
we
would
submit
that
having
justified
the
ones
they
picked
out,
that
if
they
are
representative
for
the
purpose
of
the
developing
a
prima
facie
case
equally,
our
defense
of
those
particular
differentials
should
be
representative
for
cost
defense
purposes.
if
we
meet
them
on
the
ground
which
they
choose,
which
deliberately
selects
large
independents
in
the
neighborhoods
within
a
mile
and
not
very
close
by,
but
within
a
mile
of
the
chain
stores
that
they
identified
so
that
we
would
feel
that
--
that
--
that
we
have
carried
our
burden
with
respect
to
the
stores
they've
said
unless
they
did
show
there
were
some
particular
story
that
does
not
fit
your
classification
and
that
particular
story
sufficiently
representative
to
show
that
you
have
a
genuine
problem.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
--
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
justify
the
cos
--
the
cost
of
serve
--
to
justify
the
price
differentials
identified
in
the
prima
facie
case
but
we
don't
conceive
our
burden
to
be
to
justify
every
conceivable
differential
that
we
may
have
granted
to
every
customer
that
we
serve
merely,
because
they've
identified
nine
cases.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
no
your
honor,
we
--
we
--
we
serve
only
in
chicago
area,
it's
a
local
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
all
they
would
have
to
do
is
find
what
they
believe
to
be
with
the
test
cases
that
would
sufficiently
put
us
to
a
test;
find
this
large
items
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
no,
they
would
pick
them
as
representative
examples.
they
don't
--
wouldn't
have
to
try
everyone
but
if
they
--
they
had
wrap
ups
available
in
all
the
records
that
it's
--
it's
no
great
burden
to
ask
them
to
find
this
example
that
they
assume
exists
somewhere,
this
is
not
a
--
an
un
--
unusual
burden
to
place
upon
a
plaintiff.
say
now
here,
we're
talking
about
someone
purchasing
500
points
and
we
say
he
doesn't
take
the
delivery
services.
they're
only
--
we're
talking
about
four
stores
in
the
entire
number
that
bowman
serves
that
this
rebuttal
exhibit
shows
purchased
more
than
400
points
a
day.
and
as
i
say,
they
are
not
--
it
is
not
shown
that
they
were
located
in
the
chicago
area
but
the
number
of
stores
in
the
independent
group
that
purchases
in
this
volume
range
can
be
identified
on
one
hand.
there's
no
problem
about
having
an
fbi
man
go
out
and
interview
the
store
and
say,
"does
he
put
the
milk
away
or
do
--
do
you
do
it,
how
does
it
done?"
this
and
we
--
we
--
we
would
submit,
they
had
a
fair
chance
to
develop
their
case
and
having
done
so
if
we
meet
their
case
that
should
satisfy
our
statutory
burden.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
honor,
i
would
--
i
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
your
honor,
i
merely
meant
to
say
that
certain
issues
were
framed
in
this
lawsuit
and
all
of
what
happened
if
the
judgment
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
your
honor,
let
me
suggest
that
this
is
the
proper
answer
to
that
question;
i'll
take
it
either
way.
either
this
is
the
case
involving
nine
stores
and
we've
defended
those
nine
stores
or
in
the
alternative,
the
government
has
picked
nine
stores
as
representative
of
our
entire
customer
group
and
if
it's
looked
at
that
way
if
we
defend
as
to
those
stores,
our
defense
should
be
as
broad
as
their
case.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
as
i
say
it
--
it
doesn't
--
i
haven't
thought
that
it
would
make
any
difference
how
i
--
how
i
look
at
it,
we
would
not
contend
that
they
were
barred
from
bringing
another
case
in
any
way
from
attacking
the
discount
schedule
by
saying,
well
now
we
found
the
different
store
or
something
like
that.
there's
certainly
no
--
nothing
in
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below
which
would
preclude
the
development
of
a
different
case
in
a
proper
manner
if
they
felt
it
needed
to
be
developed.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
entirely
clear
although
it
is
not
correct
to
say
that
judge
campbell
did
not
refer
to
the
nine
stores.
and
i
think
it's
five
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
no.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
no
your
honor;
i
would
assume
that
the
judgment
would
only
dispose
of
the
litigation
which
is
before
the
court
which
i
--
unders--
i
understand
were
just
praying
certain
issues
and
if
the
issues
are
narrowly
limited
to
nine
stores
it
would
only
relate
to
those
nine
stores.
if
the
government
wishes
to
argue
that
it's
representative,
perhaps
they
would
contend
that
has
broader
effect
but
i
would
not
think
so.
i
would
think
that
the
government
certainly
would
not
be
barred
from
bringing
in
another
proceeding
on
a
broader
base
or
with
different
examples.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
no
question
about
it.
they
could
start
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
i
would
think
not
your
honor
and
we
--
we
must
accept
that
as
the
rule
for
this
reason.the
market
is
constantly
changing.
there's
an
exhibit
in
the
record
which
shows
the
number
of
changes
on
the
two
delivery
routes
which
are
involved
here.
the
kroger
store
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
yes.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
yes
your
--
in
my
judgment
there's
no
question
that
they
could.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
to
--
to
state
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they,
by
their
examples,
have
shown
a
fundamental
defect
in
our
price
system,
that
then
the
court
could
grant
appropriate
relief
and
it
will
--
which
would
be
broader
than
the
specific
case
presented
and
the
relief
need
not
be
confined
to
the
nine
stores
and
i
don't
suggest
that.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
judgment
is
affirmed,
i
would
not
understand
that
the
government
would
be
barred
from
going
forward
in
this
--
in
this
area
and
the
reason
i
--
i
would
not
think
they'd
be
barred
is
because
the
market
conditions
are
constantly
fluctuating,
prices
are
changing,
discounts
are
changing.
we
would
have
to
meet
whatever
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
--
question
they
raise.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
well,
another
reason
your
honor
is
that
there'd
be
a
time
differential
also.
this
is
something
that
happened
back
in
march
or
1955,
the
situation
today
may
present
problems
which
require
reexamination.
but
i
don't
know
what
exactly
--
what
the
effect
of
the
judgment
would
be.
i
can't
imagine
they're
bringing
another
case
involving
march
of
1955
when
they
already
took
a
year
to
get
their
best
possible
case.
counsel
were
dilident
--
diligent
and
skillful
in
the
trial
court
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
well
again,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
because
i
don't
think
our
case
presents
that
problem.
i
think
our
case
presents
a
problem
of
some
specific
price
differentials
which
we
believe
we
have
had
justified.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
that's
correct.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
that's
correct.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
that's
correct.
but
they
also
went
in
to
put
in
--
they
put
in
maps
as
exhibits
showing
the
location
of
the
nine
stores
because
there's
an
obligation
as
far
as
the
affirmative
case
to
show
the
competitive
injury
element
and
they
did
show
what
the
court
found
was
sufficient
competition
although
we
disputed
that,
there's
elaborate
evidence
in
the
competition
point.
they
had
no
evidence
of
any
actual
injury
or
actual
complaints
by
any
customers
or
anything
of
that
character.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
i
think
only
in
so
far
as
they're
relevant
to
the
equitable
relief
question.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
mr.
chief
justice,
the
record
is
not
developed
on
that
point
so
that
there
isn't
evidence
one
way
or
another
as
to
what
conversation
--
certainly
these
stores
in
the
1500
point
bracket,
an
area
would
know
that
they
aren't
going
to
get
the
same
discount
as
the
very
large
one,
that
would
be
obvious;
but
the
question
is
whether
these
four
or
five
stores
that
may
have
been
of
comparable
volume,
knew
what
they
had
to
do
to
get
the
chain
discount.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
evidence
of
any
--
of
any
bulletins
or
of
any
communication
whatsoever
between
the
few
large
independents
and
the
dairy.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
only
the
discount
schedules.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
that's
correct.
but
there
is
not
any
--
any
bulletin
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
that's
correct,your
honor.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
no.
mr.
john
paul
stevens
the
discount
is
available
if
the
recommendations
of
the
cost
experts
are
followed.
now,
the
discussions
which
were
held
in
our
--
the
bowman
dairy
employee
solicitors
who
deal
directly
with
the
large
independents
and
the
small
independents;
the
record
does
not
contain
evidence
of
what
was
said
by
either
party
back
and
forth
as
to
whether
the
solicitor
suggested
to
them.
well
now
if
you
will
employ
your
own
personnel
to
put
the
milk
away
and
to
do
these
other
things,
then
the
discount
will
be
different.
there
isn't
evidence
one
way
or
another
on
that
because
it
was
not
an
issue
in
the
trial
court.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
very
--
excuse
me,
sorry
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
--
very
hastily
that
these
costs
studies
were
submitted
to
the
government
prior
to
april
20
of
1956;
less
than
five
months
after
the
prima
facie
case
was
put
in.
they
were
in
the
hands
of
the
government
for
a
year
and
a
half
while
they
made
a
thorough
analysis
of
all
the
premises
on
which
the
studies
were
based.
the
deposition
to
mr.
bergfeldfrom
which
mr.
solomon
read
was
taken
in
september
of
1956.
some
eight
months
later
in
march
and
may
of
1957,
the
government
made
the
objections
which
they
felt
were
valid
to
the
cost
studies.
they
did
not
include
any
of
the
matters
which
we're
discussing
now,
and
the
--
it
is
true
that
mr.
bergfeldhad
relied
on
data
submitted
by
bowman
to
him
for
the
purpose
of
making
his
study,
but
it's
equally
true
that
all
of
that
data
was
given
to
the
government
made
available
for
their
analysis
and
review.
they
did
not
find
any
--
there
were
literally
dozens
of
types
of
foundation
proof
that
could
have
been
incorporated
into
the
record
to
establish
admissibility
and
the
like.
the
procedure
on
the
trial
court
was
quite
different.
it
was
submitting
all
these
material
informally,
having
the
government
then
identify
the
objections
that
they
felt
were
valid
to
the
--
to
the
studies.
this
was
done
in
bowman;
then
came
forward
with
additional
evidence
on
these
specific
objections.
no
question
was
raised
about
what
discussions
were
had
between
mr.
somacas
(ph)
or
mr.
goldenstern,
the
large
independents
and
bowman
as
to
whether
or
not
the
services
should
be
withdrawn
on
a
discount
granted.
the
government
didn't
ask
those
people,
they
didn't
put
them
on
testimony,
they
didn't
develop
this
point,
so
that's
why
it's
difficult
to
give
a
complete
answer.
it's
our
position,
simply
stated,
that
the
cost
study
show
that
there
were
actual
differences
in
cost
between
the
people
involved.
they
fully
justified
the
price
differences
then
that
is
what
the
statute
required
whether
this
additional
burden
of
going
forward
in
showing
to
each
independent.
i
can
show
you
how
you
can
rearrange
the
operation
of
your
business
so
that
you
can
take
--
qualify
for
a
different
discount.
first
of
all,
we
say,
the
statute
does
not
require
that
and
secondly
the
evidence
in
the
record
doesn't
enable
the
court
to
determine
what
was
done
on
that
issue
because
the
question
was
not
raised
on
the
trial
court
and
there
are
many,
many
factors
involved
and
it
would
be
incorrect,
i
respectfully
submit,
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
independents
will
automatically
decide
they
wanted
the
discount
which
might
save
them
a
dollar
or
two
a
day
rather
than
employing
their
own
--
and
employ
their
own
personnel
with
some
extra
cost,
that
they
would
automatically
do
that
rather
than
having
the
driver
for
the
dairy
company
put
the
milk
away
and
then
pay
the
discount
under
the
schedule
mr.
john
paul
stevens
i
would
very
much
your
honor,
if
i
may
--
mr.
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'll
just
quickly
state
that
the
studies
as
has
been
indicated,
were
not
involved
in
the
averaging
of
any
kind,
they
were
store-by-store,
and
that
was
true
even
as
to
the
study
made
of
the
a&p
discount
as
a
whole
and
the
kroger
discount
as
a
whole.
what
was
done
there
was
to
analyze
the
cost
of
serving
each
kroger
store
in
the
chicago
area
and
it
was
found
that
if
those
had
been
priced
independently,
individually
rather
than
as
a
chain,
47
of
the
49
stores
would
have
earned
the
discount
of
11%
or
more.
two
of
those
would
have
earned
less,
but
it
was
our
position
that
the
excess
that
was
earned
on
the
47
stores
more
than
offset
the
--
that
which
was
the
deficiency
on
the
two
stores.
similar
procedure
followed
on
the
a&p
where
42
out
of
the
43
stores
were
found
to
be
justified
on
an
individual
basis.
there
was
no
averaging
as
between
the
chains
or
of
all
the
units
within
a
chain.
i
would
like
to
mention
very
briefly
on
the
question
of
equitable
relief.
the
evidence
doesn't
contain
any
showing
of
any
competitive
injury
of
any
kind.
the
market
has
changed,
bowman
has
lost
the
a&p
account
and
no
longer
serves
it
and
it
no
longer
serves
it.
it
no
longer
serves
the
goldblattchain
which
was
receiving
an
8
1/2%
discount
at
the
time
of
the
prima
facie
case,
so
that
there
is
no
--
and
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
any
independent
coming
in
and
saying,
well
they
wouldn't
give,
they
arbitrarily
excluded
me
from
this
family
that
gets
a
differential.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
any
independent
having
been
made
any
complaint.
the
government
doesn't
put
in
--
they
put
in
no
testimony
of
that
kind
and
made
no
representations
of
that
kind
of
--
that
kind
of
proof.
the
evidence
on
which
the
government
now
relies,
as
i
believe
i've
indicted,
is
found
in
the
rebuttal
exhibits
which
were
put
under
the
record
in
december
of
1958.
three
years
after
the
government
rested
its
prima
facie
case.
after
during
which
period
it
was
the
most
thorough
analysis
of
all
of
the
premises
on
which
our
study
was
based.
the
particular
stores
which
were
selected
for
as
representatives
for
testing
purposes
in
fact
took
the
customer
services.
i
don't
understand
there
to
be
any
dispute
about
that.
the
volume
differentials
along
with
the
difference
in
method
of
delivery
fully
justified
the
cause
--
the
price
differentials
which
are
involved
here.
the
rebuttal
exhibit
which
is
now
the
foundation
of
the
entire
government
argument,
as
i
say,
related
to
a
different
issue
the
question
of
the
percentage
of
use
of
glass
versus
percentage
uses
of
fiber,
glass
being
more
expensive
to
handle
because
you
have
to
pick
up
the
empty
bottles
and
chain
stores
use
relatively
less
glass
than
the
independents
was
shown
by
their
own
exhibits
which
they
put
in.
that
rebuttal
exhibit
is
not
confined
to
the
chicago
area,
so
the
large
stores
identified
or
referred
to
in
that
exhibit
are
not
shown
to
have
paid
a
different
price
than
the
chain
stores
did.
the
classification
on
which
bowman
predicated
its
entire
cost
study
drew
a
distinction
between
chains
on
the
one
hand
or
included
in
that
proof,
any
other
stores
receiving
limited
services
and
independents
or
any
stores
receiving
equally
extensive
delivery
services,
and
if
we
assume
that
bowman
would
follow
the
advice
of
its
cost
experts
which
they
did
when
the
put
into
effect
these
all
discount
structure,
presumably,
they
would
have
followed
that
advice
and
permitted
access
to
either
class
as
the
particularly
cost
dictated.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
bowman
cost
defense
is
sufficient.
