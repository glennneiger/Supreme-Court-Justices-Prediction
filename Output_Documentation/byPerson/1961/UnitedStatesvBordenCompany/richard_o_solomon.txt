mr.
richard
o.
solomon
i'm
afraid
your
honors
that
this
is
the
day
for
cost
accounting
matters
because
we
have
another
one
here,
all
be
at
a
relatively
modern
case
since
this
only
started
in
1951.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
by
the
northern
district
--
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
illinois
which
dismissed
the
government
complaint
charging
the
borden
company
and
the
bowman
dairy
company
with
violation
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
the
robinson-patman
act.
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
is
set
forth
on
page
2
of
our
brief
and
as
i'm
sure,
i
don't
have
to
inform
this
court,
it
general
--
it
proscribes
price
discrimination
by
a
seller
between
different
purchasers
of
light
commodities
where
the
effect
will
be
to
injure
competition
substantially
or
to
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
in
any
line
or
to
injure
or
destroy,
prevent
competition
between
a
person
receiving
the
benefit
and
somebody
who's
competing.
in
this
case,
the
court
found
that
the
price
systems
of
both
borden
and
bowman
did
prima
facie
violate
this
prohibition,
did
involve
price
discriminations
injurious
to
competition.
but
the
court
found
that
in
both
cases,
discriminations
had
been
cost
justified
under
the
proviso
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
here,
which
reads
that
nothing
herein
contained
shall
prevent
differentials
which
make
only
due
allowance
for
differences
in
the
cost
of
manufacture,
sale
or
delivery
resulting
from
the
differing
methods
or
sales
or
quantities
in
which
such
commodities
are
to
such
purchases
sold
or
delivered.
now,
we
have
brought
this
appeal
to
this
court
because
we
believe
that
in
so
finding,
the
court
has
seriously
misunderstood
the
nature
of
a
proper
course
justification
and
specifically
because
we
believe
the
court
has
incorrectly
allowed
types
of
classification
of
customers
which
if
permitted
will
allow
this
cost
defense
to
be
broadened
out
again
into
the
broad
defense
it
was
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
let
me
state
at
the
outset
that
although
there
are
two
defendants
here
and
although
the
government
thinks
that
the
difficulties
with
their
cost
differences
are
the
same,
this
court
has
ordered
that
there
will
be
separate
briefs
and
separate
arguments
with
respect
to
the
two
cases,
and
therefore
today,
i
will
be
focusing
my
attention
on
this
problem
as
it
relates
to
the
price
policies
and
the
cost
justification
of
the
borden
company,
and
tomorrow,
we
will
get
into
the
difficulties
as
we
see
it
with
the
bowman
company.
but
of
course
there's
some
background
which
are
common
to
both
of
these
cases.
as
the
court
will
--
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
i
am
arguing
today
the
case
as
relates
to
the
borden
company.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
and
we
have
a
separate
brief
with
respect
to
borden.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
mr.
ball.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
mr.
ball
will
follow
me.
if
i
have
any
time,
i
will
rebut
and
then
i
will
start
over
again
with
the
bowman
company.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
i'm
on
the
borden
case
now;
yes
sir.
but
there's
a
common
background
to
the
two
cases
let
me
stretch
that
in
very
briefly.
in
united
states
v.
borden,
347
u.s.,
this
court
had
before
the
previous
decision
of
the
same
court
which
had
dismissed
the
complaint.
at
that
time
the
complaint
involved
sherman
act
counts
as
well
as
clayton
act
counts
and
the
dismissals
for
the
sherman
act
counts
was
affirmed;
so
that's
out
of
this
case.
the
district
court
had
dismissed
the
clayton
act
counts
not
because
he
thought
there
was
no
prima
facie
case
but
because
he
thought
that
there
was
no
need
for
an
injunction
since
there
was
a
private
antitrust
case
which
had
resulted
in
an
injunction
against
these
two
parties.
and
the
court
thought
that
was
sufficient.
this
court
in
its
decision
in
united
states
v.
borden
disagreed
and
said,
that
was
not
good
grounds
for
denying
injunctive
relief
and
the
case
was
sent
back.
when
the
case
got
back
to
the
district
court
--
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
i
think
1953
or
1954
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
your
honor,
part
of
the
explanation
is
because
of
the
nature
of
the
course
justification
but
part
of
it
frankly
is
at
my
understanding,
the
matter
was
subjugated
before
judge
campbell
for
i
think,
over
a
year.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
quite
a
long
time.
it
was
just
before
judge
campbell
just
without
action
by
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
the
facts
in
this
case
relate
to
1954
and
some
of
1955
where
--
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
well,
i
presume
that
the
cost
--
certainly
the
cost
justification
would
be
different
today
and
i
presume
that
their
pricing
system
may
be
different
today.
but
it's
not
a
dead
horse
at
all
in
the
sense
that
this
case
as
it
now
stands,
stands
for
a
proposition
that
this
type
of
priced
discrimination
can
be
justified
by
this
type
of
study
and
for
the
standpoint
of
the
effect
of
this
decision
on
the
clayton
act
is
very
much
of
a
live
horse.
but
we
are
dealing,
like
the
last
case,
with
dead
facts
in
that
sense
of
the
word.
when
the
case
got
back,
the
judge
said,
i
still
don't
know
why
there
is
any
reason
for
an
injunction
in
view
of
the
grant
case.
and
the
government
said,
well
we
will
be
able
to
prove
if
we're
allowed
to.
that
these
people,
despite
this
private
injunction,
have
been
discriminating
in
price
between
their
wholesale
customers
and
this
is
what
we
are
allowed
to
try
and
prove
in
the
second
case.
this
proves
to
perform,
there
was
no
oral
testimony,
there
was
no
oral
argument
either.
this
case
took
the
form
of
agreed
stipulations
of
facts
which
were
put
into
pretrial
orders.
plus
depositions
of
expert
witnesses
and
plus
trial
briefs
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
judge
campbell
reached
this
decision.
now,
i
like
to
briefly
discuss
that
decision
because
i
think
it
sets
up
pretty
well
what
our
problem
is.
the
decision
appears
in
page
--
in
page
557
of
the
first
volume
of
the
record
and
it's
not
a
very
long
opinion
for
reason
which
i
will
go
into
very
shortly.
first
thing
that
judge
campbell
does
is
to
point
out
--
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
yes
sir
it
is,
but
i'm
afraid
i
won't
know
the
pagination
on
that
but
yes.
it
is
that
in
there
too.
the
judge
first
points
out
that
the
pricing
system
that
he
was
dealing
was
one,
which
for
both
bowman
and
borden,
involved
a
fixed
percentage
discount
irrespective
of
volume
taken
to
the
two
chain
customers
that
both
of
them
had.
and
at
the
same
time,
in
so
far
as
the
independent
store
customers
are
concerned.
in
both
cases,
graduated
discounts
based
upon
the
volume
of
products
that
they
took
which
in
no
case,
in
no
case
could
approach
or
equal
the
discounts
given
the
two
chain
customers.
in
the
case
of
borden,
the
one
we're
dealing
with
today,
there
was
more
than
twice
as
large.
the
two
chains
automatically
got
8
1/2%
discounts
off
list
price.
the
independents
in
the
highest
category
which
involved
everybody
over
150
points
a
day,
could
only
get
4%.
now,
first
thing
the
judge
did
was
to
face
up
to
the
question
of
whether
this
was
--
whether
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
because
that's
the
government's
burden,
and
on
page
563
of
the
record,
considering
the
objections
to
our
prima
facie
case
made
by
both
bowman
and
borden
and
i
must
apologize
but
this
decision
does
not
segregate
bowman
and
borden
and
therefore
in
discussing
the
decision,
i
have
to
discuss
both.
having
described
on
562
the
objections
to
the
prima
facie
case,
the
judge
finds
that
in
fact,
the
sales
made
by
the
defendants
were
in
commerce,
the
defendants
discriminated
the
price,
the
customers
and
defendants
were
in
competition
with
each
other
and
there
may
be
injury
to
competition.
i
find
that
the
published
discount
quotations
of
the
defendants
which
on
their
face
show
discrimination
so
constitute
prima
facie
violations
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
and
you
will
note
both
the
purposes
of
this
case
and
for
the
case
tomorrow
that
he
doesn't
say
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
with
respect
to
any
few
stores.
he's
talking
here
of
the
government
having
met
its
burden
of
proof
of
showing
that
this
system
was
prima
facie
in
violation
of
the
act.
then
he
turned
to
the
cost
studies
which
have
been
submitted
by
both
bowman
and
borden
to
justify
their
discrimination.
but
he
felt
that
in
view
of
what
he
thought
was
a
mandate
that
this
cost
study
should
be
liberally
construed
that
it
was
necessary
in
his
opinion
to
go
into
detail
and
now
i'm
reading
over
on
page
569
of
the
record.
the
reason,
he
said,
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
go
into
detail,
this
is
the
top
full
paragraph
here,
is
because
for
purposes
of
this
memorandum,
it
is
sufficient
to
find
as
i
do,
that
the
studies
of
both
bowman
and
borden
are
the
products
of
extensive
investigations
of
many
customers
within
given
areas
and
reflect
the
bona
fide
efforts
of
these
defendants
what?
to
determine
differences
in
cost
between
various
classes
of
their
customers.
now,
he
recognized
at
the
bottom
of
this
page,
first
full
paragraph
there,
last
full
paragraph
there,
that
one
of
the
major
government
objections
made
to
this
study,
was
that
this
classification
was
a
seemingly
arbitrary
inclined
because
of
the
fact
that
customers
who
are
classified
in
chains
got
a
fixed
percentage
discount;
whereas
the
customers
who
are
independents
could
only
get
it
depending
on
the
volumes
they
took
and
he
goes
on
to
recognize
in
the
sentence
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
that
the
government
had
in
fact
demonstrated
that
at
least
some
cases,
these
are
pre
seemingly
arbitrary
classification
results
in
percentage
discounts
which
do
not
bare
a
direct
ratio
to
differences
in
volume
of
sales.
but,
the
judge
answered,
this
mode
of
classification,
i'm
reading
from
the
top
of
page
570.
this
mode
of
classification
is
not
wholly
arbitrary.
after
all,
most
chain
stores
do
purchase
larger
volumes
of
milk
than
do
most
independent
stores.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
analysis,
he
was
able
to
conclude
the
paragraph
later
that
the
defendants
have
made
a
bona
fide
effort
to
allocate
their
cost
between
different
types
of
wholesale
customers
and
therefore
the
cost
studies
provided
an
adequate
justification
of
their
discriminations.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
there
were
figures
in
the
record
to
show
the
aggregate
sales
to
the
chains
and
the
aggregate
sales
to
each,
i'm
talking
about
borden
now,
each
of
the
four
categories
of
independents.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
the
relative
order
of
magnitude
is
set
out
on
page
217
of
the
record
and
is
that
you
would
imagine
quite
significant.
you'll
note
at
this
very
bottom,
that
page,
there's
a
schedule
there,
the
chain
stores
during
this
particular
week,
had
dollar
sales
of
$195,000;
that
was
for
254
chain
stores.
the
independent
stores
had
total
sales
of
about
half
as
much
$98,672;
which
was
for
a
total
number
of
1322
independent
stores
and
you'll
see
that
they
also
have
the
breakdown
for
the
various
stores
in
these
various
branches.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
points
are
merely
a
device
in
which
in
this
business,
you
can
translate
the
difference
between
cream
and
milk
into
one
convenient
unit.
it's
just
another
way
of
saying
the
same
thing.
in
other
words,
mr.
justice
harlan
as
we
will
get
into
it
a
few
minutes,
there's
no
question
that
there
are
major
volume
differences
between
various
of
their
customers
here.
and
there's
no
question
that
there
are
cost
savings
involved
with
that
but
that
is
not
problem
that
i
intend
to
raise.
the
problem
that
we
have
with
this
is
we
think
first
of
all
let
me
say
that
we
think
that
the
court's
opinion
is
a
fair
reflection
of
what
borden
did.
we've
set
out
in
our
brief
at
pages
11
to
19,
a
detailed
analysis
of
borden's
cost
study
here.
it
would
not
profit
either
me
or
i
think,
your
honors
for
me
to
attempt
to
go
through
at
least
at
this
time.
basically,
what
borden
did
was
to
take
its
two
chain
customers
and
put
them
on
one
side
and
take
its
four
categories
of
independent
store
customers
and
place
them
on
another
side
and
then
allocate
by
various
methods,
what
they
believe
were
the
proper
cause
to
these
various
categories.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
comparison,
it
said,
comparing
the
cause
we
have
allocated
to
these
two
chain
customers
and
their
254
stores,
as
against
their
dollar
volume;
comparing
that
cost
for
a
$100.
with
the
cost
for
$100
of
serving
the
four
categories
of
chain
stores,
we
find
and
we
attempt
to
show,
that
the
price
differential,
the
discount
differential
is
more
than
justified.
now,
it's
at
this
threshold
point,
this
classification
problem
that
we
disagree
both
with
borden
and
the
lower
court.
let
me
state
my
point
as
clearly
as
i
can,
we
do
not
believe
it's
sufficient
for
borden
to
show
that
the
cause
of
dealing
with
its
chains,
chain
store
customers
as
a
group,
its
average
cost
per
hundred
are
sufficiently
less
than
its
cost
of
dealing
with
the
various
categories
of
independents
as
a
group,
to
justify
the
differential
between
them.
we
don't
think
so
because
unless
borden
can
also
show
that
the
cost
saving
factors
which
account
for
these
differences
are
inherent
in
the
fact
that
one
group
are
chains
and
the
other
group
are
independents.
unless,
the
classification
reflects
the
cost
saving,
the
result
is
that
some
independent
stores
maybe
discriminated
against,
irrespective
of
the
volumes
that
those
stores
may
purchase
in;
and
irrespective
of
the
methods
in
which
they
may
deal
with
the
chains.
section
2
of
the
clayton
act,
we
believe,
is
not
a
class
statute;
it's
a
personal
statute.
if
you
look
at
it
you'll
see
that
what
it
precludes
is
discrimination
in
price
between
different
purchasers
of
commodities
and
specifically,
more
specifically
the
cost
justification
proviso
says,
nothing
herein
shall
prevent
differences
resulting
from
differing
methods
or
quantity
in
which
such
commodities
are
two
such
purchasers
sold
or
delivered.
we
set
out
at
page
27
of
our
brief
what
we
think
is
the
obvious
explanation
of
this
language
taken
from
the
senate
report
on
the
robinson-patman
act,
which
makes
perfectly
clear,
the
individual
rights
of
customers
to
fair
treatment
and
it
said
that
the
bill
limits
the
differences
in
cost
which
may
be
honored
in
support
of
price
differentials
to
those
marginal
differences
demonstrable
as
the
between
the
particular
customers
concerned
in
the
discrimination;
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
that
the
test
of
a
permissible
differential
depends
upon
the
question
if
the
more
favored
customer
were
sold
in
the
same
quantities
and
by
the
same
method
of
sale
and
delivery
as
the
customer
not
so
favored,
how
much
more
per
unit
would
it
actually
cost
the
seller
to
do
so
is
other
business
remaining
the
same.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
individual
right,
an
individual
customer
who
feels
he's
discriminated
against
by
a
seller
can
and
often
does
bring
trouble
damage
actions.
certainly,
it
would
not
be
a
defense
in
such
a
trouble
damage
action
for
the
seller
to
say,
yes,
it
is
true
that
i
cannot
cost
justify
the
differential
between
you
and
your
competitor
but
i
can
cost
justify
the
discrimination
between
you
and
a
group
i
placed
you
and
your
competitor
and
a
group
i
placed
him.
obviously,
that
would
not
be
a
good
defense
and
yet
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
that's
what
borden
has
done.
let
me
make
myself
clear,
we're
not
arguing
here
that
cost
justification
under
the
robinson-patman
act
in
every
case
requires
exhaustive
analysis
of
each
customer
of
the
seller.
the
practical
matter
that
would
just
mean
that
cost
analysis
was
out
and
in
will
be
half
fact
of
the
impossibility
situation
of
the
last
case.
cost
justification
based
upon
reasonable
classifications
is
an
accepted
practice
and
is
used
all
the
time.
but
unless
the
classification,
i
know
i'm
repeating
myself
but
i
think
it's
important.
unless
the
classification
which
is
utilized
for
cost
justification
purposes
reflects
a
cost
saving
applicable
to
all
members
of
one
group
and
none
on
the
other
and
unless
this
cost
saving
is
sufficiently
substantial
to
account
for
the
price
differential
itself,
the
result
will
be
that
the
classification
instead
of
clarifying
will
obscure.
this
isn't
a
new
idea
of
ours.
we
cited
on
page
30,
i
think,
of
our
brief,
some
five
or
six
ftc
cases
which
well,
we're
not
discussing
this
particular
problem,
all
stressed
the
fact
that
classification
--
has
to
be
a
proper
classification
or
the
whole
of
that
as
well.
not
only
that,
but
at
the
request
of
the
borden
company
that
was
included
in
this
record,
a
report
prepared
by
a
number
of
accounting
experts
for
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
so-called
target
report,
cost
justification
report
which
appears
in
the
second
volume
of
the
record.
if
you
would
look
at
what
this
report
of
these
experts
says
about
classification,
it
appears
on
page
776
and
777,
you'll
see
in
the
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
page
776,
they
start
out
and
this
is
the
paragraph
which
our
friends
on
the
other
side
cite.
they
start
out
by
recognizing
that
reasonable
classification
is
absolutely
necessary
as
a
practical
matter
in
robinson-patman
cases.
but,
in
the
paragraph
of
the
top
page
777,
look
what
they
say,
at
the
same
time
the
privilege
of
classification
is
not
a
license
to
disregard
sound
business
and
accounting
concepts.
in
order
to
become
the
basis
for
cost
justification
of
price
differentials,
the
classification
should
be
logical
and
should
reflect
actual
differences
in
the
manner
and
cost
of
dealing.
great
care
should
be
taken
in
establishing
price
classes
to
make
sure
that
all
members
of
the
class
are
enough
alike
to
make
the
averaging
of
their
cost
a
sound
procedure.
and
we've
attempted
on
pages
31
through
34
of
our
brief
and
i
won't
attempt
here
to
take
time
to
go
over
it;
by
various
examples
to
explain
what
happens
when
you
operate
under
improper
classification.
let
me
be
specific
about
this
case.
justice
harlan
properly
raised
the
fact
that
there
are
wide
differences
in
the
volumes
of
different
purchases
here.
the
average
chain
store
purchaser
takes
a
very
small
volume
of
purchases
and
this
averaging,
of
course,
borden
hasn't
quite
done
that,
they
have
included
all
of
the
independents
in
one
group,
they
have
four
categories
of
independents.
but
look
at
the
biggest
category,
what
borden
did,
it
started
out
with
a
category
of
0
to
25
points
and
25
to
75
and
75
to
150;
going
up
by
fairly
reasonable
incomes,
when
it
got
to
150
points,
period,
as
far
as
the
independents
are
concerned.
independents
who
took
more
than
150
points,
still
only
got
the
4%
maximum.
now
--
if
no
independents
got
very
more
than
150
points,
maybe
this
wouldn't
be
very
serious.
but
we
know,
we
know
that
at
least
one
independent
got
750
points;
six
times
as
much
so
--
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
the
fact
that
they
got
750
points
is
not
in
the
record.
the
fact
this
one
independent
got
a
great
deal
is
conceded
in
his
brief.
he
doesn't
do
it
in
750
points
a
day,
but
on
page
38
of
his
brief,
he
admits
that
the
schubert
store
got
4801
points
a
week
and
we
just
divided
it
by
six,
with
six
day
week;
and
he
conceded
that
there
were
at
least
five
other
big
stores
which
got
very
much
more
than
the
average
number
of
points
of
even
this
biggest
of
the
independent
group.
because
what
borden
have
in
this
largest
group,
the
people
who
would
be
most
affected
by
any
discrimination,
the
people
who
were
building
up
their
independent
stores
into
independent
supermarkets
to
compete
with
pricewise
with
the
chain;
where
80
stores,
some
of
which
i
presume
quite
a
few
which
were
very
close
to
the
150
breaking
point.
but
some
of
which
got
substantially
larger
and
they
were
all
thrown
into
the
pot
and
averaged
in.
quantity,
i
suggest
is
very
important
here
and
probably
the
most
important
fact
here.
i
think
that's
conceded
by
borden.
in
fact,
most
of
these
other
problems
probably
would
have
been
obviated
if
borden
had
extended
its
discount
up
higher
that
arbitrary
4%.
but
this
discrimination
by
classification
is
not
limited
to
quantity.
for
example,
borden
has
lumped
this
group
of
80
independents
all
those
who
took
or
needed
to
take
services
beyond
the
outside
rear
platform
inside
the
store
with
those
who
either
didn't
take
it
or
wouldn't
have
taken
it
if
they
had
known
as
they
didn't
know
that
they
could
have
gotten
a
cheaper
discount
if
they
did.
similarly,
although
borden
claims
it
costs
more
to
do
business
on
a
cash
basis
than
on
a
credit
basis,
it's
lumped
together
in
the
same
category
of
80
independent
stores,
those
that
paid
on
the
cash
basis
and
those
that
paid
on
the
credit
basis.
and
i
could
continue
this
but
this
is
the
problem
we
have.
now,
it
suggest
--
it
suggested
that
it's
all
very
well
for
us
to
talk
about
proper
classification
but
when
you
get
right
now
down
to
it,
what
we're
insisting
upon
is
such
a
complicated
myriad
of
subclasses
and
part
classes
in
what
have
you
that
we're
really
asking
borden
to
cost
justify
individually
again.
in
our
opinion,
that's
nonsense.
most
--
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
no
sir.
we
certainly
do
not.
we
do
claim
this.
most
of
the
price
differentials
in
this
type
of
business
of
selling
milk
to
the
wholesale
groceries
flows
from
quantity
either
directly
or
indirectly
because
of
methods
which
in
turn
reflecting
one.
now,
most
of
these
problems
we
think
would
be
obviated
by
the
discount
system
which
didn't
cut-off
the
independents
at
4%,
which
allowed
the
independents
to
get
what
quantity
discounts
they
could
qualify
for.
there
may
be
some
other
cost
savings
which
are
applicable
to
chains
as
such
and
not
to
independents
as
such
which
don't
really
reflect
quantity
and
to
the
extent
that
there
are
such
of
course,
borden
would
be
entitled
to
give
a
differential
for
that
and
to
cost
justify
for.
but
to
suggest
that
would
have
to
be
40
or
50
categories
is
really
very
unrealistic
because
most
of
these
distinctions
--
most
of
the
distinctions
that
may
exist
are
so
infinite
decimal
in
price.
in
the
actual
saving,
one
classes
against
the
other
that
nobody
certainly
not
borden
which
is
in
business
to
make
money
and
not
to
put
out
cost
studies,
nobody
is
going
to
have
differentials
that
they
have
to
even
justify
with
respect
to
that.
of
course,
if
they
want
to,
if
they
want
to
get
credit
for
every
conceivable
possible
differential,
then
they're
going
to
have
a
complicated
cost
study,
but
that's
their
choice
not
ours.
and
as
far
as
we
can
see,
by
a
simple
pricing
system
which
attempts
to
allow
everybody
to
get
the
benefits
of
the
volumes
they're
entitled
to
and
which
make
such
differentials
as
might
be
appropriate
for
any
other
major
item.
both
the
pricing
system
and
the
cost
justification
which
will
follow
will
become
relatively
easy.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
it
depends,
what
you
mean
by
bona
fides.
we
have
no
attack
on
the
cost
studies
as
doing
what
they
say
they're
doing.
we
certainly
don't
--
well
they
say
the
figures
are
such
and
such,
we
don't
say
they're
not
such
and
such;
of
course
not.
they're
bona
fide
in
the
sense
that
if
this
is
a
valid
theory,
if
what
borden
has
done
--
if
borden's
theory
of
classification
and
allocation
is
a
valid
theory,
we
don't
dispute
that
the
facts.
no,
the
facts
are
stipulated.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
i
wouldn't
think
of
using
such
terms.
i
think
borden
had
established
a
price
system
which
in
fact
was
discriminatory.
they
did
not
attempt,
unlike
bowman
and
i'm
not
saying
they're
wrong
about
this
but
borden's
cost
study
happens
to
be
a
post
facto,
after
the
event
analysis
of
what
have
happened.
i'm
sure
that
they
were
obviously
attempting
to
apply
what
they
thought
were
valid
accounting
techniques
to
see
whether
they
could
justify
this
differential.
i
certainly
do
not
say
they
were
not
operating
in
good
faith
but
i
think
that
what
they
in
fact
did
would
necessarily
lead
to
breaking
down
the
limitations
on
this
cost
justification
and
having
it
right
back
to
where
it
was
under
the
1914
act.
now,
in
the
brief
time
i
have
because
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
little
for
rebuttal,
let
me
make
two
other
points.
their
suggestion
in
borden's
brief
--
suggestion
in
borden's
brief
that
as
a
practical
matter,
they
don't
cut-off
the
independents
of
4%;
that
independents
who
have
substantially
higher
volumes
of
purchases
can
and
as
a
normal
case
do
get
more
than
4%.
this
just
has
no
support
in
the
record
whatsoever.
not
only
that
it
had
no
support
from
the
record,
it's
contrary
to
the
stipulation
of
facts
upon
which
the
record
is
based
because
borden
stipulated
and
this
is
why
the
court
so
held,
borden
stipulated
and
i'm
reading
from
page
76
of
the
record,
that
exhibit
a
and
that
is
the
price
schedule.
that's
the
public
price
schedule
which
is
the
only
the
thing
that
anybody
saw.
exhibit
a
was
used
as
the
basis
for
computing
discounts
upon
all
sales
of
all
fresh
milk
products
including
fluid
milk
made
by
borden
to
independently-owned
customers
in
the
chicago
area
during
the
period
june
1,
1954
to
august
28,
1955.
there's
an
exception
if
you
read
on
there;
the
exception
is
for
three
stores.
with
the
exception
of
three
stores,
borden
stipulated
that
this
was
the
price
system
which
was
used
for
all
stores.
and
accordingly,
that's
the
way
the
decision
is
written
and
if
you
will
read
borden's
over
100
page
brief
--
trial
brief
from
the
court
below,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
as
a
general
policy,
they
allow
independent
stores
more
than
4%.
and
if
you
read
their
cost
study,
there
isn't
a
suggestion
about
this
--
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
4%.
this
whole
argument
which
is
a
bladed
afterthought
in
which
i
consider
as
a
compliment
to
us
because
it
indicates
that
they
recognized
the
difficulties
in
having
cut
off
the
4%,
this
whole
argument
is
based
upon
the
fact
which
appears
on
page
80
of
the
record
that
three
stores
which
the
government
happen
to
use
in
illustrating
its
prima
facie
case.
the
public
store,
the
schubert
store
and
the
cartman
store
did
in
fact
receive
an
additional
one
and
a
half
percent
discount.
it's
suggested
that
that
shows
that
the
large
stores
usually
or
always
got
extra
discounts
particularly
since
schubert
happens
to
be
the
biggest
store.
but
if
you
just
look
at
these
charts,
you'll
see
that
can't
be
true.
if
you'll
work
it
out,
you'll
find
out
that
the
public
store
far
from
being
a
large
independent
store
actually
has
less
average,
less
volume
of
milk
than
the
average
independent
in
the
4%
bracket.
and
if
you'll
look
just
ahead
of
the
public
store,
you'll
find
that
a
store
which
apparently
is
two
or
three
blocks
away
and
which
had
a
volume
within
$20
of
the
public
store's
volume
of
milk
during
that
week,
got
4%
discount.
the
fact
is
that
this
just
doesn't
prove
anything
and
this
case
was
tried
on
a
completely
different
basis,
the
basis
which
they
are
stipulated
to.
now
the
other
thing
i
want
to
say,
because
i
do
want
to
reserve
a
little
time
is
about
the
argument
they've
made
in
their
brief
that
they
have
cost-justified
with
respect
to
the
schubert
chain,
the
schubert
store.
we
will
use
that
as
an
illustration
and
they
attempted
to
come
back
and
say,
in
point
4
of
their
brief,
look,
we've
taken
your
biggest
store
and
we've
proven
that
an
individual
basis
that
it's
cost
justified.
well,
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
this.
in
the
first
place,
they
have
cost
justified
this
schubert
store
at
five
and
a
half
percent
that
it
actually
got,
rather
than
the
4%
which
this
case
is
about.
so,
if
they
were
correct
and
had
proven
that
the
schubert
store
is
cost
justified
at
five
and
a
half
percent,
all
they
would
show
i
submit
is
that,
if
they
had
not
cut-off
at
4%
and
allowed
people
to
go
on
up,
they
wouldn't
have
had
these
problems.
but
more
important
than
that,
let
me
refer
you
to
page
57
of
their
brief
and
the
chart
there
which
purports
to
show
how
schubert
was
cost
justified.
when
you
read
their
brief,
you'd
think
maybe
that
these
figures
from
mr.
henry
schubert
on
the
right-hand
column
there
were
figures
from
this
underlying
material
they
had.
but
that
isn't
--
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
57
of
their
white
brief.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
the
text
implies
that
these
figures
come
from
the
rootman's
chart,
et
cetera.
but
this
isn't
so
except
for
the
first
two
figures
there.
all
the
rest
of
those
figures
on
this
page
are
calculated
figures.
now
the
importance
is,
all
of
the
minor
calculations,
the
$1.34
for
branch
office
clerical
salaries,
the
1cent
for
the
accounting
department,
the
11
cents
for
robert
white,
the
tabulating
department
5
cents,
the
$2.32
on
lost
and
returned
products.
all
those
figures
used
a
calculation
which
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
one
that
schubert
was
one-eightieth
of
the
number
of
stores
in
this
category
and
therefore
its
cost
for
this
factor
should
be
one-eightieth.
but
when
you
get
to
the
salesman
and
the
solicitor's
salary
figures,
this
is
very,
very
far
from
the
truth.
suddenly,
instead
of
$6,
which
would
be
one-eightieth
of
287,
you
get
$21
more
than
three
times
as
much.
if
in
fact,
they
calculated
salesman's
salaries
on
the
same
basis
as
they
had
calculated
all
the
other
costs
which
weren't
actual
costs,
the
cost
per
hundred
of
sales
to
schubert
would've
been
$5.84
or
$5.89.
and
instead
of
schubert
being
almost,
not
quite,
cost
justified
at
this
five
and
a
half
percent
figure,
it
would
be
$1.5
not
cost-justified.
there
are
other
difficulties
that
i
could
point
out
but
i
really
think
--
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
that's
right.
we
don't
object
to
that.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
when
they
got
to
salesman
and
solicitor's
salaries,
it
was
a
pretty
big
figure
which
is
a
figure
which
they
claim
doesn't
relate
to
volume
in
the
same
way
that
the
others
do.
instead
of
doing
it
at
one-eightieth,
they
said,
schubert's
--
the
cost
of
salesman
and
solicitors
and
these
figures,
your
honor,
are
figures
for
--
men
to
go
around
selling
to
these
stores,
although
schubert's
been
solo
already
and
servicing
in
the
sense
of
answering
complaints.
mr.
richard
o.
solomon
he
was
the
biggest
of
the
independents.
but
they
said
here,
we
will
assume
that
this
figure
should
be
based
on
a
volume
basis
that
somehow
the
amount
of
time
that
a
salesman
spend
in
going
around
to
these
various
independents
is
proportional
to
volume
and
there
isn't
any
support
for
this
in
the
record
or
whatsoever
and
we
suggest
that
it
doesn't
make
sense.
what
this
means
is
if
you
calculate
it
out,
that
they
are
arguing
is
that
the
schubert
store
has
13
times
as
much
money
spent
on
it
by
salesman
and
solicitors
as
the
average
independent
store.
now,
maybe
schubert
has
a
few
more
complaints
because
it's
bigger
than
some
of
the
smaller
ones,
i
don't
know.
maybe
it
does.
but
certainly,
to
say
that
this
figure
is
proportional
to
volume
doesn't
make
any
sense.
certainly,
in
saving
a
chain,
it
wouldn't
make
too
much
difference.
they
say
the
chains
are
served
by
executives
and
therefore
we
don't
have
anything
for
them
but
in
serving
a
chain,
i
don't
think
we'd
make
much
difference
whether
the
average
chain
store
had
500
points
a
day
or
300
points
a
day.
similarly,
we
don't
think
that
it
really
depends
as
to
how
much
time
they
spend
in
the
schubert's
store,
whether
it
has
800
points
a
day,
700
or
600.
