justice

so
you're
on
the
borden
case
now?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
points?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
points?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
i
didn't
quite
follow
this
last
annotation
on
page
57.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that
up
and
until
you
get
the
salesman
increase
their
salaries,
why
that's
reasonable;
it's
one-eightieth
of
the
total,
that
is
for
accounting
department,
tabulating
department
in
lost
and
returned
products.
well,
it's
an
estimate
--
it's
a
reasonable
estimate
of
one-eightieth
of
the
total
of
that
interest
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
is
it
that
you
object
to
about
this
21.38?
justice
potter
stewart
schubert's
was
the
biggest
of
the
independents?
justice
potter
stewart
your
point
is?
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
those
eight,
three
of
them
are
getting
prima
facie
--
justice
potter
stewart
no
indication
out
of
the
balance
of
the
independent
stores
how
many
was
getting
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
only
one
factor.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
factors
of
billing
and
of
solicitation
and
what
were
these
other
factors?
justice
potter
stewart
--
about
325
points,
am
i
right
with
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
presumably
we're
getting
325
points
of
these
were
you
think?
justice
potter
stewart
two
or
more
were
getting
647.95.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
average
per
store.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
average
per
store?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
they
showed
up
that
average
was
500.
justice
potter
stewart
average
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
users
were
there?
how
many
stores?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
probably
not
important.
justice
potter
stewart
to
show
what
the
--
how
big
the
largest
chain
store
units
were?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
points
to
get
up
to?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here
to
say,
out
under
table
12b,
there
are
several
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
thousands
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
mr.
bergfeld?
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
--
this
is
that
you've
been
referring
to
272
and
so
on,
material
that
was
prepared
then
for
the
purposes
this
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
independents
were
on
cod
basis,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
did
they
pay
cash?
justice
potter
stewart
entirely.
justice
potter
stewart
were
these
nine?
justice
potter
stewart
were
these
nine?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
not?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
were
and
how
many
weren't?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
1949
that
you
point
out.
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
chains
or
that
rather
the
two
chains
were
on
a
billing
system.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose,
this
delay
to
collect,
is
part
of
this
collection,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
probably
was
waited
to
see
the
man
for
whom
they
collect.
justice
potter
stewart
it
took
13
one-hundredths
of
a
minute
and
i
guess
it
took
their
minute
19
one-hundredths
to
actually
make
their
collection.
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
business
has
taken
customer
services
to
these
customer
services,
the
various
ones,
something
that
varied
in
a
store
from
day
to
day?
justice
potter
stewart
that
some
day
it
wants
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
then
the
same
store
would
not
want
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
this
was
a
cost,
the
very
cost
of
keeping
this
available
having
this
available
is
it
continuing
cost,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
fully
fair,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
have
different
route
men
serving
the
independents?
justice
potter
stewart
the
same
driver
would
call
on
both.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
idea
that
all
independents
will
want
this
more
expensive
service
all
independents
are
the
same
and
their
efficiency
and
their
desires
to
cut
down
cost.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
however
that
the
exhibit
number
4
was
prepared
for
the
purpose
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
structured
points,
it's
your
maximum
discount
stops
you
get,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
we
just
looking
at?
i
can't
find
--
what
page
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
so
400
points.
justice
potter
stewart
400
points.
justice
potter
stewart
why
should
it
stop
anywhere?
well
i
guess
you're
going
to
tell
us
that
because
that's
the
basic
attack
that
the
government
makes,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
any
ceiling
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
from
what
volume
are
those?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
leave
that
it
--
it's
just
been
stated
by
opposing
counsel
that
there's
no
argument
about
the
fact
that
these
nine
stores,
these
independent
stores
did
take
the
services,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
record
shows.
