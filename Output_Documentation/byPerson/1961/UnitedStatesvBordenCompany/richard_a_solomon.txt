mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
gather
from
mr.
ball
that
my
main
task
here
is
not
show
that
we
have
correctly
stated
our
theory
as
to
why
the
decision
below
was
wrong,
but
to
show
that
the
decision
below
properly
reflected
their
cost
study,
because
he
hasn't
really
attempted
to
defend
the
decision
below
which
i
think
fairly
reflects
what
borden
put
up
to
the
court
below
as
their
cost
justification.
if
you
gentlemen
will
read
the
borden
cost
justification
which
is
fully
set
out
in
their
brief
and
in
the
record,
and
if
you
will
read
their
trial
brief
which
is
mostly
set
out
in
the
record,
you
won't
find
any
of
this
discussion
that
we
had
here
this
morning
because
what
borden
attempted
to
do
below
and
what
the
court
below
said
was
correct
was
to
cost
justify
by
these
averaging
techniques
of
all
independents
in
one
class
as
against
the
chains.
now,
it
suggested
here
that
really
all
we
were
attempting
to
show
was
wrong
were
eight
stores
at
all
they
were
attempting
to
cost
justify
were
eight
stores.
and
your
honor
justice
harlan
said
that
was
a
kind
of
a
bill
of
particulars
and
that
was
what
we
were
limiting
ourselves
to.
but
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
that's
nonsense.
under
the
morton
salt
case
of
this
court,
that's
334
u.s.,
this
type
of
cost
discrimination
is
almost
per
se
a
violation
at
one
of
defenses
can
be
made.
in
the
morton
salt
case,
this
court
said
the
federal
trade
commission
was
going
away
outside
what
it
had
to
do
when
it
tried
to
prove
and
reprove
and
reprove
what
is
pretty
much
an
obvious
fact
and
when
you
have
a
group
of
retail
stores
in
the
city
like
chicago
competing
with
one
another
and
some
get
one
price
and
another
get
another
price,
this
may
tend
to
substantially
lessen
competition
because
after
all
clayton
act
is
a
“may”
act.
but
in
order
to
nail
this
down
because
we
suspected
that
there
would
be
some
objections
that
they
weren't
really
in
competition,
objection
was
made
by
bowman
not
borden.
we,
in
each
case,
took
a
sampling
and
we
use
this
sampling
in
course
approving
our
prima
facie
case
to
prove
what
we
thought
was
obvious
in
the
first
place
but
to
nail
it
down
to
show
that
where
you
have
independent
stores
and
chain
stores
within
a
compact
area
of
a
mile
or
so,
some
of
those
customers
who
go
into
a&p
store
shop
and
go
into
independent
stores
sometime
and
vice
versa.
and
that's
all
these
eight
or
nine
exhibits
were
used
for.
they
were
used
as
what
i
can
think
what's
probably
an
unnecessary
nailing
down
of
a
prima
facie
case
and
this
was
recognized.
judge
campbell,
when
you
read
his
opinion
does
not
say
we
made
a
prima
facie
case
as
effect
to
these
nine
stores
you
don't
even
mentioned.
he
recognizes
we're
making
a
prima
facie
case
with
respect
to
area.
now,
there's
been
some
talk
here
about
this
bulk
exhibits
being
part
of
the
record
and
we
could
approve
everything
from
this
bulk
exhibits
and
leaving
out
the
question
of
who
had
the
burden
of
proof
of
proving
a
cost
justification.
it
is
not
a
coincidence
that
these
bulk
exhibits
are
not
before
this
court.
in
fact
it's
my
why
understanding
that
they
were
never
physically
before
the
district
court.
what
these
bulk
exhibits
were,
were
the
work
papers,
the
work
papers
which
the
borden
people
used
in
making
their
cost
study.
they
worked
as
mr.
ball
quite
properly
said,
bulk
up
and
made
available
to
the
government
in
checking
their
work
papers.
but
they
were
never
submitted
to
the
court
either
by
the
government
or
by
borden
because
nobody
thought
they
were
relevant
except
in
checking
the
general
figures
that
borden
was
doing
because
borden
wasn't
before
that
court
making
a
justification
on
a
store-by-store
basis.
and
that's
why
those
work
papers
are
not
before
this
court
and
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir,
i
do
not
insist
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
i
am
not
insisting
if
they
make
a
cost
justification
in
each
store.
as
i
try
to
point
out
yesterday,
all
we
are
insisting
on
is
before
they
classify
stores
and
then
make
a
cost
justification
by
groups
that
they
make
sure
that
the
classification
reflects
the
particular
cost
savings
they're
talking
about
specifically
as
your
honor
said
perfectly
clear
from
his
whole
case
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
cost
saving
as
the
result
of
volume.this
is
particularly
true
in
delivery.
obviously,
on
a
per
quart
basis
or
per
hundred
dollars
of
sale
basis,
it
cost
less
to
serve
big
stores
and
small
stores.
well,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
volume
savings,
we
don't
say
that
they
can't
classify
for
cost
justification
purposes
stores
with
equivalent
volumes.
but
what
we
do
say
is
you
can't
do
what
borden
did
and
take
all
independent
stores
that
have
anywhere
as
from
a
150
points
a
day
to
750
points
a
day
and
classify
them
while
your
classifying
the
chains
separately
who
as
mr.
ball
admits
take
on
the
average
less
than
the
750
to
the
extent
of
volume
as
a
factor.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
only
one
factor.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
all
these
other
fact
--
really
here,
you
have
about
three
or
four
factors.
if
you
read
this
thing
through,
what
you
have
here
is
quantity
which
is
the
main
factor.
then
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
think
of
it
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
think
a
decree
which
would
require
the
borden
company
to
make
whatever
discount
brackets
they
wish
to
set
up
based
on
whatever
differentials
they
want
to
set
up
available
to
anybody
who
can
qualify.
fairly
simply
decree
of
that
nature
would
do
the
trick.
in
other
words,
we
--
and
this
i
think
i
can
answer
both
your
question
and
justice
stewart's
question
at
the
same
time.
if
borden
thinks
there
are
savings
and
quantities
which
there
obviously
are
and
that's
the
major
one.
they
can
set
up
a
quantity
discount
which
is
open
to
everybody
and
the
decree
should
say
that
if
they
want
to
have
discounts
based
on
quantity,
it
has
to
be
open
to
schubert
as
well.
now,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
other
factors,
they
can
also
set
up
their
discount
on
that
basis.
in
store
services
which
mr.
ball
talked
about,
it's
quite
true
that
if
a
store
whether
it
be
an
independent
or
a
chain
requires
the
truck
driver
to
bring
the
milk
into
the
store
and
deposit
it
in
thing
that
takes
somewhat
more
time
and
would
be
as
far
as
we
know,
for
a
fully
justifiable
basis
for
having
a
differential.
now,
if
they
want
to
say
people
will
take
in-store
services
will
be
paid,
will
pay
ex
--
extra
or
say
the
others
that
don't
will
get
a
discount
they
can
do
that.
we
will
allow
that
in
the
decree.
all
we're
saying
is
that
on
these
two
or
three
of
four
major
factors
which
are
the
only
factors
justice
stewart
that
anybody
would
really
want
to
set
up
with
discount
for,
they
want
to
set
up
as
discount
for,
the
decree
should
simply
state
that
these
discounts
are
to
be
specified
and
be
available
to
everybody
is
eligible.
and
that's
all
you
did
in
a
decree
and
that
would
eliminate
all
problems,
we
think.
the
classification
difficulties
that
we
got
in
cost
justification,
is
merely
because
they
didn't
do
this
in
their
original
method
of
giving
discounts
here.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
--
well,
maybe
i
can
take
it
up
on
my
next
argument
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
the
actual
consequences
of
formula
that
i
suggest
is
one;
that
the
chains
will
presumably
get
about
what
they
are
getting
now.
two,
that
the
bigger
independents
would
probably
immediately
got
a
larger
discount
and
three,
those
bigger
independents,
the
type
of
people
who
were
trying
to
compete
with
change
who
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
it
could
get
even
larger
discounts.
now,
it
may
very
well
be
for
example
with
respect
to
the
schubert
chain
but
under
the
present
system
where
it
doesn't
know
and
was
never
been
told
that
the
--
it
gets
a
higher
discount
if
it
doesn't
take
in-store
services
that
they
are
taking
in-stores
services.
but
under
my
plan,
of
course,
they
would
be
told
if
you
take
in-store
services
will
cost
you
a
little
bit
more
and
they
would
have
the
choice
of
deciding
whether
they
want
to
take
advantage
of
cost
that
way
you
are
not.
now,
i'm
going
to
sit
down
and
stand
up
again
if
you
gentlemen
don't
mind
because
under
--
oh
gee,
i
forgot
--
procedures
has
been
established
and
now
going
to
discuss
the
bowman
case.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
our
problems
in
bowman
are,
we
think
some
similar
to
those
in
borden.
mr.
ball
is
quite
right
in
saying
it's
a
different
type
of
cost
study
of
i
what
showed
you
that
this
is
the
same
thing.
let
me
state
our
general
thesis
at
the
beginning
again.
if
you
want
a
class
--
if
you
want
to
cost
justify
discrimination
between
types
of
store
and
do
so
by
a
cost
justification
which
classifies
stores.
this
classification
has
to
be
based
upon
cost
saving
factors
which
are
applicable
to
all
of
one
class
and
none
of
the
other
and
which
account
for
the
differentials
--
a
very
simple
basic
position.
now,
the
bowman
discount
schedule
appears
on
page
67
of
the
record.
this
is
the
bowman
discount
schedule.
actually
there
are
several
bowman
discount
schedules
in
this
record
they
were
variation
as
they
went
along
but
i
think
for
present
purposes
we
can
stick
with
the
one
took
in
june
1954.
there
are
minor
variants
and
one
additional
factor
which
is
thrown
into
the
pot
and
the
later
schedules
to
account
for
somewhat
greater
differential.
but,
for
our
purpose
so
we
can
stick
with
this
exhibit
1
on
page
67.
you
will
note
that
--
this
is
the
published
discount
schedule
unlike
the
borden
discount
schedule
in
terms
applies
to
everybody
but
in
fact,
supplies
only
to
the
independents
and
you'll
notice
that
it's
similar
to
the
borden
discount
schedule
and
that
for
the
independents
they
have
a
graduated
discount
except
that
it's
much
broader
and
starts
lower
and
goes
by
more
minute
percentages
and
actually
they
calculated
within
these
figures.
for
example,
somebody
getting
135
points,
i
gather,
would
get
6.7
or
something
in
between
this
and
which
have
more
detail
breakdown
of
the
independent
discounts
up
until
200
points
on
page
67
it
only
goes
up
to
150
points,
but
if
you
will
turn
over
the
page
on
page
68,
you'll
see
that
within
a
month
and
a
half
after
this
discount
schedule
was
put
into
effect,
they
actually
raised
it
to
8%
for
up
--
for
over
200
points.
now,
this
was
the
published
schedule.
the
only
published
schedule
that
grocers
in
chicago
got.
but
if
you
like
at
the
letters
on
page
69
and
70,
which
are
letters
to
their
two
chain
customers
in
this
case
a&p
again
and
the
kroger
company.
i
gather
justice
white
that
these
must
be
different
a&p
stores
and
that
much
be
wide
closet
there
is
no
split
thing.
i
don't
think
that
these
are
the
same
a&p
stores,
is
that
correct?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
these
letters
indicate
that
the
chains
here
we're
giving
an
11%
flat
discount
irrespective
of
the
amount
of
stuff
they
took.
now,
the
critical
point
i
want
to
make
is
bowman
had
a
fairly
good
quantity
discount
schedule
for
independents
starting
it
zero
and
going
right
on
up
200.
when
it
got
to
200
points,
that's
all
apparently
cost
saving
stop
there
but
it
still
--
the
independents
stores
didn't
stop
there
because
the
record
allow
its
justice
we
gone
this
subject
as
the
borden
record,
the
record
has
certain
indications
of
how
big
some
of
these
independent
stores
are.
if
you
will
turn
to
page
481
of
the
record,
you
will
find
a
chart
which
pulls
out
half
across
the
page.
this
is
called
table
12a
and
it
was
done
for
a
completely
different
purpose
whether
to
illustrate
my
point.
this
is
a
one-third
sample
--
this
is
a
one-third
sample
of
the
bowman
routes
and
therefore
recognizing
it,
it
is
only
a
sample
into
what
be
an
accuracies
you
can
multiply
these
figures
roughly
by
three.
well,
you
will
note
that
as
you
would
expect
most
of
the
bowman
stores
are
under
200
points.
but,
in
this
one
third
sample,
there
were
16
bowman
stores
that
had
over
200
points
and
four
them
that
had
over
400
points,
more
than
twice
as
much.
and
if
you'll
look
over
to
the
column
under
a
number
of
stores
south
division,
you'll
see
there
were
two
of
them
in
the
south
division
that
had
over
400
points
and
if
you
will
go
back
to
the
average
points
delivered
daily
to
the
south
division,
you'll
see
that
the
average
of
those
two
stores
in
the
south
division
was
647
points.
in
other
words,
assuming
if
they
both
got
exactly
the
average
at
least
two
stores
of
this
one
third
sample
were
not
getting
200
points
but
were
getting
over
three
times
to
this
and
yet
they
were
cut
off
--
they
were
cut
off
when
they
reached
the
200
point
level.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
i
calculate
just
the
directly
opposite.
they're
both
over
400.
it's
the
average
of
these
two
over
400
was
647.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
so,
i
assumed
that
one
of
them
was
over
647
and
one
is
under
647.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
the
figures
as
to
the
chains
by
the
way
in
the
bowman
settle
deal,
i
can't
tell
you
the
breakdown
of
kroger
and
a&p
because
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
it.
for
all
we
know,
kroger
was
getting
several
hundred
points
on
the
average
more
than
a&p
or
vice
versa.
the
record
is
just
silent
but
the
average
chain
store
and
so
on
the
next
page
was,
there
is
no
point,
no
thing
the
--
a
lot
of
thing
to
look
at
it.
the
average
chain
store
was
500
points
more
than
most
independents
but
less
than
the
some
of
the
independents.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
average
for
all
of
the
chain
both
kroger
and
a&p.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
know.
there
is
somewhat
larger
number
--
how
many
a&p
store
there
was?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
--
well
i
don't
know.
i
can't
find
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
don't
know.
but
we
are
--
i
can't
point
that
out
for
you.
now
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
but
we
can
assume
that
the
--
the
essence
--
i
think
it
does
show
bigger
up
to
much
bigger
than
any
of
them
the
--
it
does
show
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
some
of
them
got
over
two
of
them
or
three
of
them
got
two
of
them
got
over
a
thousand
points.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
that's
right.
and
how
big,
how
much
over
a
thousand
points,
we
don't
know.
now,
bowman's
cost
justification
before
the
court
was
quite
a
different
animal
than
the
borden
cost
justification
because
bowman
before
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
really
make
any
attempt
for
reason
which
i
do
not
understand
to
distinguish
volume-wise.
their
basic
pitch
before
the
court
of
appeals,
were
there
were
two
essential
differences
in
method
of
delivery.
they
said,
what
they
did
was
they
calculated
by
time
studies
and
other
allocations
what
they
figured
was
a
cost
per
quart
of
serving
the
chains
and
a
cost
per
quart
of
serving
the
independents
at
any
given
volume
level
for
cost
per
quarter
saving
the
chains
of
that
volume
level
and
the
cost
per
quart
at
saving
the
independents
at
that
volume
level.
and
they
compared
these
two
costs
per
quart
of
serving
these
two
groups
at
any
volume
level
and
their
comparison
showed
according
to
their
calculations
in
each
instance
that
there
was
a
sufficient
difference
of
the
cost
for
selling
into
the
chains
was
sufficiently
less
to
account
for
the
3%
differential
between
the
highest
bracket
or
in
fact
to
account
for
whatever
differential
that
would
be
at
that
volume
level
for
independents.
at
least
this
was
true
above
160
or
180
points.
this
difference
in
cost
per
quart
at
any
volume
level
was
at
each
case
entirely
due,
entirely
due,
to
two
factors
which
were
allocated
entirely
to
the
independents
and
not
at
all
to
the
chains.
but
first
and
the
major
one
of
these
factors
was
what
they
call
optional
customer
services.
the
word
“optional”
i
suggest
gives
the
game
away
but
we'll
get
into
that
in
a
second.
optional
customer
services,
and
there
are
old
friends
that
we
had
yesterday
and
earlier
this
morning
in-store
services
--
services
beyond
the
back
platform
and
the
theory
upon
which
these
services
are
allocated
to
the
independents
and
not
to
the
chains
is
that
they
have
an
agreement.
they've
worked
it
out
with
the
chains
were
barred
they
will
just
drop
milk
off
from
the
back
warehouse
and
most
independents
like
these
services
and
therefore
they
will
charge
them
to
all
the
independents.
now,
this
is
really
a
startling
remark
so
maybe
i
better
read
a
little
bit
about
what
borden's
--
i
mean,
bowman's
says
show
that
i'm
not
just
making
this
up.
let
me
refer
you
to
page
272
of
the
record
which
is
the
basic
borden
manual
for
setting
up
this
cost
justification.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
bowman.
i
may
misstate
myself,
but
i'm
talking
about
bowman.
and
you'll
see
a
paragraph
about
wilson
next
to
the
last
of
the
last
full
paragraph.
how
are
these
differences
created?
once
the
driver
arises
at
the
customer's
stop,
there
are
some
necessary
work
elements
he
must
perform.
beyond
this,
there
are
some
optional
delivery
services
that
the
driver
may
be
requested
to
do,
may
be
requested
to
do,
such
as
to
deliver
the
order
inside,
place
the
containers
in
a
refrigerator,
rearrange
the
containers
so
that
any
product
remaining
unsold
from
yesterday
will
be
sold
first
today,
leave
case
of
products
at
different
spots
in
the
store
et
cetera.
the
type
of
service
performed
varies
greatly
as
does
also
the
extent
of
the
service
requested.
very
few
stores
are
rendered
exactly
the
same
services.
but
yet,
this
extensive
pool
of
services
must
be
available
for
all
the
drive.
in
addition,
most
store
customers
pay
the
driver
in
cash
daily
rather
than
paying
him
by
check
monthly
or
semimonthly
and
the
last
sentence
is
the
other
special
factor
charged
to
independents
and
not
to
the
chains.
the
independents
are
all
charged
with
flat
fee
for
the
time
spent
in
cash
payments
daily
plus
something
called
delay
to
collect
which
i
do
not
understand
which
is
part
of
the
same
business
whereas
none
of
the
chains
are
because
the
chains
are
on
a
credit
basis.
although,
admittedly
here,
all
of
the
chain,
all
of
the
independents
are
not
on
a
credit
basis.
if
you
look
on
page
275,
they
explained
this
a
little
further
and
they
say
nearly
all
stores
require
the
optional
delivery
services
in
daily
cash
payment
and
therefore
have
the
most
expensive
type
of
delivery.
a
relatively
few
numbers
of
stores,
require
only
the
necessary
work
elements
and
consequently
have
the
cheapest
type
of
delivery.
experience
has
shown
that
the
independently
owned
stores
generally
want
the
optional
services
which
may
include
some
of
the
following
work
elements
and
then
they
list
this
stop
again.
and
if
you
look
over
on
page
278,
i
won't
take
time
to
read
it,
you
will
see
that
they
expressly
and
explicitly
say
that
it
is
this
customer
service
element
and
the
collection
elements
which
are
responsible
for
the
entire
difference
in
the
cost
per
quart
of
serving
the
independents
at
any
volume
and
the
cost
per
quart
of
serving
the
chains
at
any
volume.
now,
what
kind
of
studies
did
the
accountants
for
the
bowman
dairy
make
to
see
about
these
customer
services?
let
me
say
that
these
customer
services
were
charged
on
a
per
unit
basis.
i
haven't
found
much
in
the
record
to
explain
to
me
why
these
customer
services
were
supposed
to
vary
with
volume
particularly
since
they
say
that
the
--
which
customer
services
people
take
vary
from
customer
to
customer
but
bowman
charged
these
customer
services
to
the
independents
on
a
volume
basis
with
the
result
that
an
independent
taking
600
points
was
charged
three
times
as
much
for
these
customer
services
as
an
independent
taking
a
200
points
even
if
he
--
either
did
not
take
any
of
them
or
just
took
a
very
minor
one,
or
if
he
had
known
about
this
business
which
of
course
they
never
did
know,
he
wouldn't
have
taken
any
of
them.
now,
what
type
of
survey
did
bowman's
technical
expert
made
to
find
out
about
this
customer
service?
did
he
speak
to
the
customers
and
see
whether
they
were
taking
them?
he
did
not.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
bergfeld.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
as
i
understand
that
it
was
--
yes.
he
did
not.
he
made
no
story.
they
asked
him,
"did
you
speak
to
the
customers?"
and
he
said,
"i
certainly
did
not."
this
is
all
on
page
1238
of
a
second
volume
of
the
record.
do
you
see?
we
didn't
talk
of
bowman
customers
at
all.
what
did
they
do?
we
asked
the
bowman
dairy
staff
and
employees
what
service
arrangements
were
and
asked
them
to
arrive
at
a
considered
standard
practice
which
would
be
the
thing
to
be
expected
to
be
done
most
of
the
time
and
most
of
the
cases.
now
that's
how
this
cost
study
was
set
up.
did
you
ask
any
official
at
the
bowman
dairy
company
whether
or
not
any
of
the
independents
have
been
notified
that
if
they
do
not
want
the
services
that
they
could
get
a
discount
comparable
to
the
chains
if
they
took
comparable
volume?
we
didn't
ask
that
question.
do
you
know
--
have
you
ever
seen
any
bulletins
or
communications
to
independents
that
they
did
not
desire
the
services
listed
in
paragraph
2
(a)
which
is
the
service
that
they
would
be
submitted
the
same
discount
as
chains
provided
they
took
a
comparable
volume.
we
did
not
ask
for
such
bulletin,
we
did
not
ask
to
see
them.
in
other
words,
this
entire
business
is
pure
speculation
based
upon
advised
to
the
alleged
accountant
in
setting
up
the
service
from
the
bowman
officials
as
to
what
they
thought
was
a
standard
practice.
and
this
was
the
entire
basis
except
for
this
collection
cost
which
they
also
admit
are
not
applicable
to
some
of
the
independents.
it's
the
entire
basis
for
these
difference
and
cost
per
quart
upon
which
they
then
base
their
entire
discount
schedule
and
cost
justification
according
to
their
theory.
now,
in
view
of
all
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
our
entire
argument
sir
is
that,
there
can
be
classifications
if
they
are
based
upon
actual
cost
differences
between
the
types
of
people
put
into
a
class.
but
we
do
not
say
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
here.
we
say
that
they
have
conclusively
proved
in
this
case
that
what
they
have
done
is
flown
independents
who
are
taking
these
services
into
the
same
part
with
independents
who
are
not
taking
these
services.
they
have
thrown
independents
who
wouldn't
think
of
taking
these
services
they
knew
it's
going
to
be
--
the
result
is
going
to
be
that
they
won't
have
to
face
3%
more
for
their
milk
into
those
who
would
necessarily
have
to
take
it
anyway.
our
problem
is
that,
they
have
cost
justified
on
a
classification
which
includes
all
independents
in
one
group.
although
the
facts
make
perfectly
clear
that
all
independents
don't
belong
in
this
group.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
the
sum
total
of
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
sum
total
of
our
argument
is
that
if
they
have
discriminated
against
independents
who
are
in
a
position
to
take
in
the
same
volumes
by
the
same
methods
as
the
chains.
they
have
precluded
them
from
getting
the
same
discounts
because
they
have
charged
to
those
independents
whether
or
not
they
take
them
and
whether
or
not
they
would
take
them
if
they
knew
about
this
system.
they
have
charged
to
these
independents
cost
which
are
true
of
a
group,
of
a
class.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
practical
result
is
--
the
practical
result
is
that
if
one
of
these
large
independents
which
i
pointed
to
which
has
the
same
volume
as
a
chain
or
a
higher
volume
of
chain,
were
tomorrow
to
come
to
--
the
were
tomorrow
to
say
to
the
truck
driver,
“we
have
decided
that
we
don't
want
to
take
any
of
these
in-store
services
and
we're
already
paying
by
credit
or
we
go
by
credit.”
under
the
bowman
system,
they
would
still
get
8%
rather
than
11%
which
their
competitors,
the
chains
were
getting.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
exactly
right,
exactly
right.
and
these
gentlemen,
unlike
our
friends
in
borden,
don't
claim
that
the
independents
were
getting
special
deals
that
there
is
no
such
claim
here,
but
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
the
system
is
a
very
simple
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
system
of
how
they
pay
is
very
simple.
they
have
a
system
which
cuts
off
200
points
up
to
200
points
as
you
take
more
volume
when
independent
gets
a
higher
discount,
but
when
he
gets
200
points,
that's
all.
but
as
to
the
chains,
they
simply
give
them
11%
which
is
3%
higher
than
any
independent
to
get.
the
system
is
that
the
justification
is
improper
in
our
opinion
because
it
justifies
by
throwing
into
the
pot
these
extra
cost
which
the
independent
some
of
them
don't
take
and
many
others
wouldn't
take
if
they
knew
that
this
was
the
basis
upon
which
they
are
being
discriminated
against.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
if
they
can
prove
that
this
was
an
inherent
aspect
of
cost
savings
to
independent
as
a
group,
as
against
chains
as
a
group,
of
course
they
can
do
it.
if
they
can
prove
that
there
are
something
inherent
in
the
fact
that
you
are
a
chain
which
makes
it
cheaper
to
sell
than
to
an
independent
because
of
your
type
of
ownership
or
because
you
are
a
chain
or
an
independent,
then
under
the
statute,
they
are
entitled
to
have
a
discount.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
they
can't
prove
it
this
way.
they
can't
prove
that
it's
inherently
cheaper
to
sell
the
chains
than
the
independents
by
factors
which
are
not
true
of
all
the
independents
and
wouldn't
be
true
of
many
more
independents
if
they
knew
what
was
going
on.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
absolutely.
it
poses
upon
the
court
the
duty
of
looking
at
the
classification
and
saying
now,
does
this
classification
reflect
cost
savings
which
are
applicable
to
one
class
and
not
applicable
to
the
other
or
does
it
merely
reflect
groupings
which
are
not
applicable
class
against
class
but
are
mixed
between
the
classes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
of
course,
it
could.
what
is
true
in
chicago
may
not
be
true
on
some
other
places.
but
the
importance
of
this
justice
black
is
that,
the
court
here
has
approved
a
system
of
cost
justification
which
if
this
opinion
has
approved,
will
mean
in
the
future,
they
won't
have
to
worry
about
rational
classification
as
long
as
things
average
out,
that
would
be
good
enough
and
this
will
mean
in
the
future
that
this
type
of
system
can
be
used
by
all
sorts
of
chains
to
persuade
big
sellers
to
gets
them
real
advantages.
and
with
all
due
respect
to
mr.
borden,
i
always
thought
the
robinson-patman
act
was
passed
primarily
to
make
sure
that
chains
don't
get
unfair
advantage
of
their
large
buying
power.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
perfectly
clear
on
section
2
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
that
the
burden
of
proving
cost
justification
rests
with
the
seller.
the
burden
proving
a
prima
facie
case
rests
with
the
government.
a
burden
then
shifts
under
2
(b)
expressly
to
the
seller.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
burden
of
proving
that
there's
been
a
price
differential
which
may
tend
to
lessen
competition
is
on
the
government.
the
burden
of
proving
that
that
is
cost
justified
is
expressly
made
upon
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
a
quart
of
milk
costs
20
cents
and
they
give
the
chain
11%
discount
from
that
20
cents
and
they
give
an
independent
8%
discount
of
fees
in
the
highest
bracket.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
if
that's
they
were
doing
on
this
study,
then
it
varies
to
some
but
there
is
a
differential.
in
fact,
this
is
one
of
the
lesser
of
the
differential.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
there
was
a
claim
and
that
gets
back
into
this
prima
facie
case
which
i'd
like
to
discuss
if
i
may.
because
bowman
even
more
than
borden
argues
that
the
prima
facie
case
that
the
government
made
here
was
limited
to
a
similar
list,
i
think
it's
nine
stores
in
this
case
and
that's
all
we
prove
and
they
claim
that
they
cost
justified
these
nine
stations
on
an
individual
basis.
now
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir.
it
wouldn't
mean
that
all.
they
claim
that
--
they
claim
that
they
did
something
was
unnecessary
because
they
wanted
to
prove
beyond
doubt
that
their
general
classification,
which
i've
argued,
was
improper
actually
works
out
in
practice
to
be
proper.
i'll
get
in
to
the
fact
of
their
alleged
proof
of
these
nine
stores
in
a
few
minutes.
but
i
just
want
to
make
perfectly
clear
that
--
as
in
borden,
these
nine
stores
were
not
the
prima
facie
case.
but
government
here
wasn't
wasting
its
time
bringing
an
action
against
these
people
to
have
fairness
with
respect
to
nine
stores,
two
a&p
stores
and
five
or
four,
eight
independent
stores.
what
we
are
interested
in
--
what
we
were
attempting
to
get
and
what
everybody
recognize
below
was
this
entire
differential
broken
down
for
the
chicago
area.
what
we
did
with
bowman
as
with
borden
is
have
an
example
of
a
nine
stores
in
two
parts
of
two
routes
stores
close
together.
for
the
same
purpose
and
doing
the
same
thing
to
show,
again,
what
we
thought
was
obvious
and
what
we
think
is
unnecessary
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
morton
salt
case
that
these
stores
were
in
competition
because
our
friends
in
bowman
argued
vociferously
that
they
weren't
in
competition,
that
this
whole
business
of
competition
was
beloning
that
people
don't
shop
from
supermarket
to
supermarket,
that
they
have
their
own
favorite
stores
and
that
they
extent
of
competition
and
therefore
the
effect
of
this
price
differential
was
meaningless.
well,
as
again,
we
thought
that
was
unnecessary
to
really
prove
but
to
prove
it
conclusively,
we
took
a
sampling.
we
could
have
taken
the
whole
city
of
chicago
if
we
want
and
done
and
made
a
much
broader
sample
but
that
would
have
been
exactly
to
fly
into
the
phase
of
what
this
court
said
in
morton
salt,
the
federal
trade
commission
we
shouldn't
do
and
just
wasting
time
in
doing.
but
we
took
a
small
sample
of
two
routes
and
said,
“all
right
now,
you
say
that
they're
not
in
competition,
here
is
the
people
that
go
into
both
stores”
and
that
all
there
to
this
alleged
fact
that
we
prove
this
case
--
we
proved
a
prima
facie
case
solely
with
respect
to
nine
stores.
the
court
didn't
think
so
and
we
didn't
think
so.
you'll
read
the
government's
trial
brief
which
is
not
printed
in
the
record
but
which
is
before
this
court.
you'll
find
that
our
prime
facie
case
discuss
this
primarily
as
our
prima
facie
case
the
discount
schedule
and
then
uses
these
nine
stores
as
an
example
to
prove
it.
and
you'll
find
that
bowman's
reply
to
these
things
treats
it
the
same
way.
let
me
say
briefly
about
the
alleged
proof
store
to
store
with
respect
to
the
nine
stores.
this
appears
in
exhibit
14.
exhibit
14
starts
at
page
328
of
the
record
and
chapter
one
of
that
is
what
purports
to
be
a
test
of
these
individual
stores.
now,
let's
see
what
mr.
bergfeld
who
is
making
the
report
here,
says
he
did
and
remember
that
mr.
bergfeld
is
that
he
never
spoke
to
any
of
the
individual
store
about
anything,
and
i
just
got
this
information
from
bowman.
now,
what
did
he
do
in
this
test?
did
he
speak
to
people
or
didn't?
well,
reading
at
the
bottom
of
page
329
here
what
he
said
he
did,
“well
each
store
on
this
route,
all
deliveries
during
the
week
of
march
14th
to
19th
were
included
in
the
study.
this
accounted
for
a
variations
and
order
of
size
throughout
a
weekly
period.
each
store
--
each
customer's
actual
volume
and
product
mix
were
used
as
the
basis
for
computing
delivery
cost,
platform
cost
and
list
prices.”
in
other
words,
they
did
find
out
what
the
average
actual
volume
and
product
mix
of
these
stores
were.
did
they
make
a
survey
of
their
customer
services?
they
did
not.
turn
to
page
330.
delivery
cost
was
based
on
a
regular
service
available
and
generally
provided
to
the
type
of
store.
since
the
driver
and
its
equipment
must
be
prepared
to
perform
any
or
all
the
group
of
services
setup
for
independent
stores.
the
cost
of
that
group
is
calculated
as
part
of
delivery
cost
and
it's
incorporated
into
the
discount
schedule.
this
includes
daily
cash
payment,
any
optional
services,
beyond
a
sidewalk
on
floor
delivery,
conversely
only
of
the
essential
element,
services
are
provided
for
chain
store
outlets.
it
is
understood
that
additional
time
is
considered
unavailable
to
them
and
further
that
the
store
manager
will
expedite
delivery.
in
other
words,
this
alleged
store
to
store
survey
is
no
more
a
valid
in
their
general
store
to
store
survey
because
it's
based
on
an
assumption
with
respect
to
these
customer
services.
and
my
time
is
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
all
of
the
independents
were.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
do
you
mean
in
these
nine
or
in
the
entire
independents?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
all
independents
were
not
on
the
cod
basis.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
know.
but
all
the
independents
were
not.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
definitely
not
admittedly.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
the
only
figures
i
can
give
you
sir
are
and
this
definitely
is
not
too
accurate
but
the
nearest
thing
to
accuracy
on
this
i
have
is
exhibit
4
on
page
286
which
appendix
a
there
has
a
standard
time
allowances
for
1949
time
study.
this
is
before
this
particular
case
but
i
think
these
are
the
time
studies
upon
which
a
lot
of
these
calculations
were
based.
not
on
whether
this
proves
anything
but
you'll
know
that,
when
they
are
talking
about
number
of
customers
at
the
top
here
on
this
other
items,
they
mentioned
1265
and
189
look
at
that
(voice
overlap)
943.
now,
whether
that
barely
reflects
the
situation
or
not,
i
don't
know.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
all
i
can
say
is
it's
admitted
in
the
record
that
all
do
not
and
beyond
that
i
don't
know.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
but
the
main
factor
here
your
honor
actually
the
main
differential
is
this
customer
service.
the
collection
cost
are
an
additional
factor
but
at
least
the
collection
cost
were
charged
on
per
store
basis,
it
didn't
have
this
volume
factor
which
made
them
out
off
as
the
stores
got
bigger
and
bigger.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
never
understood
what
delay
collect
was.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
guess
so
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
now,
my
friend
here
i'm
sure
is
going
to
say
that
the
record
indicates
although
a
lot
of
the
independents
didn't
take
any
customer
services.
but
the
record
--
the
one-third
sample
which
is
the
only
thing
we
have
in
the
record
does
indicate
that
the
very
biggest
independents
took
some
customer
services.
i
have
two
things
to
say
to
that.
i
think
that's
probably
true
as
long
as
this
discount
system
doesn't
distinguish
between
what
they
can
get
and
what
they
can't
get.
but
there
isn't
any
indication
that
these
biggest
stores
would
take
these
services
if
they
knew
that
this
was
going
to
be
the
difference
between
8%
and
11%
discounts.
moreover,
again,
it
doesn't
really
mean
anything
to
show
that
a
store
took
collect
a
customer
services.
because
this
customer
service
category
includes
so
much
which
they
say
vary
so
much
from
store
to
store.
but
a
big
store
may
take
a
very
minor
item
and
yet
they
will
be
listed
as
having
taken
customer
services
in
charge
for
the
entire
business.
the
fact
is
that
32%
of
the
stores
didn't
take
any
customer
services
and
we
suggest
many
more
wouldn't
if
they
knew
this
was
going
to
be
the
basis.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
what
they
say.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
what
they
say.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
should
imagine
so.
i
should
imagined
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that's
a
right
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
their
argument.
their
argument
is
we
don't
know
what
this
going
to
be,
what
we
make
this
available
to
everybody,
we
don't
tell
them
we're
making
available
to
them
our
charging
point.
we
make
them
available
to
everybody
and
i
guess
their
theory
of
why
it
should
be
on
a
volume
basis
is
that
theoretically
since
these
services
are
available
to
people
to
people
in
the
biggest
stores
who
would
ask
for
huge
services
because
they
have
more
problems.
but
there
is
not
any
showing
if
that's
what
happens
and
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh
no,
oh
no,
(voice
overlap)
oh
no,
these
were
all
both
bowman
and
borden.
the
trucks
on
these
roads
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
as
i
told
you
your
honor,
it's
based
upon
the
assumptions
made
by
the
bowman
executives
of
what
they
thought
was
the
standard
practice
and
not
based
on
anything
else
because
nobody
ask
the
independents.
obviously,
a
large
independent
can
set
himself
up
if
he
wants
in
a
matter
to
a
very
close
to
a&p
and
the
chains
deal.
small
corner
grocery
man
i
presume
would
be
very
difficult.
a
mom
and
pop
store,
he
may
have
to
use
some
services.
but
a
large
independent
can,
if
he
wants,
set
himself
up
to
operate
exactly
like
a&p
and
kroger.
no
he
doesn't
have
to
--
and
they
can
make
a
differential
on
this
basis
too
if
they
want
or
say
we're
going
to
charge
so
much
per
quart
if
you
take
in-store
services
and
less
if
you
don't.
and
then
they
can
give
these
large
independent
supermarkets
a
choice
and
they
could
either
try
and
compete
pricewise
getting
the
full
discount
that
the
a&p
and
kroger
chain
do,
or
they
can
try
to
compete
service-wise
and
try
to
forget
about
the
price
differential
take
these
extra
services
so
they
could
cut
down
on
the
people
they
hire,
but
they
don't
give
them
that
choice
and
that's
our
problem.
there's
one
other
point
which
i
haven't
enough
time
to
reach
which
is
whether
this
whole
case
is
here
or
whether
we
stipulated
the
case
out
of
court.
i
can
only
say
that
we've
explained
that
thoroughly
in
our
brief
and
that
if
you
read
the
colloquy
between
the
judge
and
the
united
states
in
this
case,
it
will
be
perfectly
clear
that,
two
things,
first
of
all,
the
judge
thought
he
was
only
stipulating
as
to
admissibility
in
information.
and
secondly,
that
the
united
states
stressed
over
and
over
again
that
it
was
going
to
raise
these
basic
points
as
well
as
technical
points
which
we
haven't
bothered
this
court
with
and
we
did
raise.
we
raise
this
very
point
with
respect
to
the
falsity
of
this
classification
based
upon
the
customer
service
and
collection
which
didn't
apply
to
all
independents.
we
raise
this
in
our
brief
below
and
borden
responded
and
they
did
not
suggest
to
the
court
below
that
we
stipulated
this
out
of
court
because
of
course
we
hadn't.
