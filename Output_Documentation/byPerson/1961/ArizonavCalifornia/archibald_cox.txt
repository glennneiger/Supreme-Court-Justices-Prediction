mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
court.
before
the
recess,
i
had
set
forth
a
summary
of
our
view
on
the
first
division
of
the
case.
that
view
as
i
said
is
essentially
the
same
as
arizona's
and
essentially
the
same
as
nebraska,
although
there
are
differences
in
emphasis
and
differences
on
subsidiary
points
notably
that
they
had
served
the
waters
above
lake
mead.
california's
view
at
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
would
say
that
the
tributaries
flowing
in
the
lake
mead
should
be
treated
the
same
way
as
the
mainstream
above
lake
mead.
mr.
archibald
cox
with
the
effect
to
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
below
lake
mead,
we
say
that
the
gila
is
arizona's.
and
the
real
substantial
difference
here
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
is
that
california
wants
to
apportion
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
plus
the
gila,
and
arizona
wants
to
keep
the
gila
and
the
portion
of
the
waters
in
the
colorado
river.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
the
hard
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
misunderstood
and
i
was
thinking
of
the
upstream
tributaries.
mr.
archibald
cox
where
--
with
respect
to
the
gila,
we're
completely
with
arizona
and
therefore,
we're
much
more
with
arizona
in
the
whole
justice
douglas.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
think
he
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
well,
i
think
he
has
power
to
do
two
things.
we
think
he
had
power
to
say
to
arizona,
“we
will
give
you
2,800,000
less
your
existing
upstream
uses”
because
we
think
he
had
power
to
give
in
the
neighborhood
of
2,800,000.
second,
we
think
he
has
the
power
to
say,
“if
you
do
divert
from
saying
the
little
colorado
that
then
i
am
going
to
give
you
less
water
out
of
lake
mead.”
mr.
archibald
cox
because
the
gila
is
not
part
of
the
supply
that
the
congress
thought
it
was
apportioned.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
lake.
mr.
archibald
cox
into
the
lake,
yes.
it
was
quite
plainly,
i
think
quite
frankly
that
i
think
i
can
show
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
quite
plainly
allocated
to
arizona.
i
think
one
could
see
this
if
he
follows
down
the
legislative
history
in
the
way
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
don't
find
it
necessary
to
argue
here
or
indeed
to
discuss
whether
the
secretary
has
power
to
contract
out
of
water
into
little
colorado
river
before
it
gets
to
closer
to
the
dam.
i
would
assume
that
he
has
not,
that
his
contracts
relate
to
water
coming
out
of
lake
mead.
but,
i
had
--
so
that
i'll
state
the
whole
thing.
i
say
that
he
does
have
the
power
to
say,
“i'll
give
arizonians
2,800,000
feet
out
of
lake
mead
as
long
as
you
arizonians
do
nothing
to
diminish
the
supply
going
into
lake
mead.”
i
think
he
has
a
power
to
say
that
if
you
diminished
it,
i'm
going
to
take
that
away
from
you.
mr.
archibald
cox
charge
it
against
you,
that's
the
right
description.
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes
mr.
archibald
cox
and
--
and
partly
on
the
basis
of
the
language
of
section
4
of
the
project
act
your
honor,
both,
i
have
in
mind
particularly
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
of
the
project
act
which
i
will
--
i
was
really
just
trying
to
outline
it
now.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
decisive
difference
between
the
gila
and
what
i
call
the
upstream
tributaries,
yes?
it's
decisive.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
said
that
there
were
some
uses
as
our
preference
of
all
uses
he
said
along
the
little
colorado.
there
are
not
--
they
don't
mount
to
verify.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
would
be
above
--
that
would
be
below
lee
ferry,
between
lake
mead
and
lee
ferry.
he
said
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
not.
it's
the
--
there
isn't
enough
water
to
be
worth
flushing
about
really.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it's
a
possibility,
a
theoretical
point
that
comes
into
the
analysis
rather
than
a
practical
difference
in
the
use
of
water.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
so.
no,
no.
no.
because
not
unless
--
no
is
the
answer
period.
california's
analysis
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
project
act
is
irrelevant
to
the
interstate
allocation
of
this
water.
in
all
but
one
respect,
they
do
conceive
that
section
4
puts
a
limitation
on
the
amount
of
water
that
california
can
have.
they
say
that
the
universe
that
project
act
apportions
is
all
the
water
in
the
basin,
the
mainstream
plus
the
gila
to
put
in
pragmatic
terms,
and
that
they
are
entitled
to
7.5
million
plus
one
half
of
the
amount
over
7.5
million
of
all
the
water
in
the
basin
so
that
we
--
mr.
archibald
cox
excuse
me,
4.4
so
that
the
--
did
i
say
4.5?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
have
said
4.4
out
of
7.5
plus
one
half
of
the
remaining
water
in
the
basin
where
as
we
say
the
universe
being
apportion,
is
the
colorado
river
was
and
specifically
excludes
the
gila.
that
colorado
--
california's
apportion
as
i
understand
it,
foreseeing
its
price
saying
that
first
what
should
estimate
the
total
dependable
supply
of
the
amount,
there
on
the
basis
of
present
guesses
is
not
to
be
assured.
and
that
that
water
should
be
apportioned
between
arizona
and
california
on
the
basis
of
the
priorities,
the
time
of
appropriation
under
western
water
law.
the
water
in
the
surplus,
the
excess
over
7.5,
there
would
also
apportion
of
partly
to
--
to
existing
project.
i
am
not
quite
clear
frankly
whether
california's
position
is
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
governs
as
to
the
apportionment
of
the
excess
over
7.5
or
whether
it
does
not.
i
think
the
thesis,
central
thesis
of
their
whole
case
is
that
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
does
govern
as
to
the
whole
thing.
but
this
is
the
point
which
seems
to
me
not
to
be
clear
on
the
briefs
or
oral
arguments.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
now,
it
maybe
worth
pointing
out
in
practical
terms
just
how
the
water
would
be
divided
under
these
two
rival
views,
and
i
have
taken
in
breaking
it
down
the
dependable
supply
as
one
assumption
because
that's
what
california
asks
us
to
make.
and
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
total
of
7,500,000
acre-feet
in
the
mainstream,
which
is
the
assumption
that
congress
made.
taking
the
5,850,000
first,
you
would
find
that
under
california's
view,
california
would
get
4,400,000.
arizona
--
under
california's
proposal,
they
would
get
4,400,000.
arizona
would
get
3,400,000.
i'm
sorry
i'm
lost
by
my
own
table.
i'm
talking
of
--
i'm
going
to
divide
it,
california
proposal
and
master's
report.
california
out
of
the
assumed
dependable
supply
would
get
4,400,000
their
proposal
and
3,000,000
for
on
the
master's
report.
nevada
out
of
the
same
assumed
dependable
supply
would
get
120,000
on
the
california
theory
and
234,000
on
the
master's
report.
arizona's,
out
of
the
total
supply
of
5,800,000
roughly
would
get
1,100,000
on
the
california
theory
and
2,100,000
on
the
master's
report.
so
there's
a
difference
of
something
over
1,000,000
acre-feet
between
arizona
and
california
and
that
assumption
of
the
flow
of
the
stream.
now,
if
you
assume
as
congress
did
in
1927
and
1928
that
there
would
be
7,500,000
acre-feet
a
year.
it
works
out
this
way.california
on
its
proposal
would
get
5,400,000.
on
the
master's
report,
it
would
get
4,400,000,
again,
about
1,000,000
acre-feet
of
water.
nevada
on
the
california
proposal
would
get
300,000
in
either
event.
arizona
would
get
1.8
under
the
california
theory
and
2.8
under
the
master's
report.
so,
there's
about
1,000,000
acre-feet
of
water
difference
in
the
two
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
california
gets
5,400,000
because
they
get
4,400,000
plus
half
of
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
and
to
calculate
what
it
would
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
on
the
whole
if
there
is
7.5
in
the
mainstream,
i
took
california's
assumption
that
it
was
2,000,000
in
the
gila.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
say
that
is
an
assumption.
it
depends
on
contested
issues
with
respect
to
measurement,
a
very
sharply
contested
issues
that
master's
report
was
rejecting,
but
it
seemed
--
one
have
to
take
some
figure
and
it
seem
as
well
take
this
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
which
isn't
worth
--
really
isn't
much
worth
wearing
on
that.in
fact
i
assumed
2,000,000
in
the
rest
of
the
basin,
not
just
for
gila.
in
choosing
between
these
two
basic
approaches
throughout
plus
the
number
of
subsidiary
issues,
but
the
central
ones,
the
ones
which
i
should
try
to
focus
on
concerned
first
the
definition
of
the
universe
that
is
being
divided
here
whether
it
is
all
the
water
in
the
basin
as
california
said
or
whether
it
is
the
mainstream
including
some
of
the
upper
tributaries
as
we
say
along
with
the
arizona
and
to
some
extent
massive.
then
the
second
issue
of
course
is
how
once
the
universe
has
been
decided
shall
claims
against
it
the
rank
in
order
of
priority
according
to
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
as
california
says
or
shall
the
available
supply
be
distributed
pro
rata
on
the
basis
of
the
project
act
and
the
statute
as
the
master
says,
the
arizona
content
as
we
think
is
proper.
i
would
emphasize
--
i
think
i
said
this
before,
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
it
does
not
seem
to
me
here
necessary
to
reach
any
final
decision
on
the
meaning
of
the
compact.
it
is
relevant.
there
are
possible
meanings
to
the
compact
that
one
surely
has
to
take
into
account.
but
on
our
view
of
the
case
and
on
the
master's
view
of
the
case,
there's
no
necessity
for
reaching
any
final
judgment
on
any
question
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
compact
because
we
think
regardless
in
which
way
those
questions
are
decided,
the
result
should
be
the
one
the
master
recommends,
something
to
my
mind
are
difference.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
now
if
i
may
a
little
more
detail.
the
questions
that
arise
if
the
basic
theory
of
the
master
is
accepted
because
there
are
a
number
of
them,
maybe
helpful
at
least
to
have
them
in
mind
as
we
examine
that
theory
in
more
detail.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
do.
his
--
his
basic
interpretation.
the
reason
i
used
basic
theories
because
the
first
of
the
questions
that
arises
even
if
the
court
contempt
its
basic
theory
is
whether
he
was
right
in
--
in
validating
the
clauses
that
pertain
to
the
upper
tributaries
and
the
mainstream
above
lake
mead.
of
course,
we
say
that
it
was
wrong.
a
second
question
is
whether
nevada
users
require
additional
contracts
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
or
whether
the
contract
intended
to
the
master's
report
is
a
sufficient
contract
to
give
them
the
right
to
use
the
water.
but
we
think
that
further
contracts
with
users
in
addition
to
the
bear
allocation
to
the
state
is
required.
there
is
a
problem
which
was
mentioned
--
mr.
archibald
cox
required
before
they
have
any
right
to
the
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
secretary
must
contract
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
he
has
power
to
choose
with
whom
may
will
contract.
that's
the
important
thing.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
unless
the
state
is
going
to
be
a
user
in
gross
in
this
--
yes.
we're
saying
he
is
confined
to
contracting
with
users.
another
question
which
is
of
no
importance
in
this
case
but
therefore
i
should
ask
the
court
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
would
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
would
say
that
the
act
does
not
contemplate
that,
that
the
act
contemplates
the
actual
man
who
applies
the
water
is
to
have
a
contract
with
the
secretary.
the
master
--
another
subsidiary
question
concerns
priorities
intrastate.
the
master
indicated
in
his
report
and
in
his
decree
the
goals
were
to
be
determined
according
to
state
law.
we
think
that
that
was
a
wrong
and
unnecessary
determination
on
his
part.
i
shall
argue
particularly
that
it
was
unnecessary
and
that
the
issue
is
not
right
for
determination
now
that
simply
that
the
decree
should
say
nothing
on
one
way
or
the
other
about
question
of
intrastate
priorities.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes.
i
was
just
trying
to
put
this
in
focus.
i
may
be
complicating
it
by
listing
so
many.
but
then
of
course,
there
is
the
further
question
concerning
the
meaning
of
present
perfected
rights
in
which
there's
an
issue
and
finally,
there
is
the
big
question
concerning
indian
reservation.
now,
what
further
preliminary
point?
i
do
think
it's
important
to
suggest
to
the
court
the
difference
that
in
the
disposition
of
the
case
at
this
stage,
it
would
do
well
to
focus
on
upon
whether
to
accept
or
reject
the
essential
thesis
of
the
master's
report
that
if
it
determines
to
accept
it,
then
some
of
these
other
questions
may
be
appropriately
decided.
but
then
if
it
rejects
the
essential
thesis,
the
basic
thesis
of
the
master's
report,
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
attempt
on
the
basis
of
these
briefs
and
this
oral
argument
to
determine
any
of
the
remaining
questions
because
there
are
large
number
of
questions.
now,
i
would
just
like
to
indicate
their
nature
which
were
exceedingly
complex
of
which
have
been
assumed
for
the
purpose
into
the
present
argument
by
a
number
of
us,
which
don't
matter
very
much
in
determining
the
sound
as
to
the
essential
thesis
of
the
master's
report,
but
which
have
not
been
adequately
kept.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
the
two
points,
the
meeting
of
the
limitation
--
what
the
universe
being
decided
is
--
and
whether
there
are
to
be
priorities
or
ratable
apportion.
if
you
reject
the
notion
that
his
definition
of
the
universe
or
if
you
reject
his
notion
of
a
ratable
reduction
at
the
event
of
shortage,
then
there
are
such
a
hostile
questions
that
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
attempt
to
determine
them
on
the
present
briefs
which
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
would.
i
think
i
do
indeed.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
i
think
it
really
either
of
them,
certainly
the
first
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
example,
if
you
reject
either
branch
of
the
main
thesis,
then
there
comes
the
question,
should
there
be
an
estimate,
a
finding
on
the
dependable
mainstream
supply?
and
if
so,
what
is
it?
that
is
something
on
which
as
of
now
there
is
no
finding.
there's
no
question
(inaudible).
if
you
reject
his
essential
thesis,
there
is
a
major
issue
as
to
what
becomes
of
what
we
call
the
article
iii
(b)
(1),
the
1,000,000
acre-feet
allocated
to
the
lower
basin
and
in
addition
to
the
7,500,000.
there's
no
dispute
about
that
so
long
as
the
master's
recommendations
prevail.
but
if
i
understand
the
history
of
this
case
is
extreme
dispute
about
it
then
i
can
see
many
grounds
of
dispute
if
that
is
rejected.
again,
if
arizona
is
to
be
charged
for
the
use
of
the
water
on
the
gila
river,
it
becomes
a
question
as
to
how
you
measure
those
uses,
a
question
that
has
been
very
hotly
argued
at
times
in
the
past.
do
you
measure
them
by
beneficial
uses
along
the
stream
or
do
you
measure
them
by
the
amount
that
those
uses
reduce
what
flows
in
to
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river?
you
get
very
different
answers
according
to
your
method
of
measurement.
if
just
to
mention
one
more,
if
there
is
to
be
a
compact
of
apportionment,
that
is
to
say
one
must
determine
the
meaning
of
compact,
there're
two
questions
arise.
one
is
how
do
you
charge
evaporation
loses
in
lake
mead?
maybe
they
should
be
charged
against
beneficial
use.
many
of
my
associates
think
they
should.
that's
not
important
in
the
present
posture.
again,
if
you
are
going
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
compact
because
that
determines
the
meaning
of
the
project
act,
i
would
think
the
court
after
this
closer
study
of
the
case
by
--
well,
i
wish
to
determine
whether
the
upper
basin
states
didn't
have
to
be
heard.
so
that
all
i'm
trying
to
do
is
to
indicate
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
this
isolated
theory
theory
and
it
shouldn't
be
assumed
that
it's
all
been
canvassed
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
substantially.
i
hesitate
a
little
bit
be
candid
because
i
am
not
quite
certain
whether
there
should
simply
be
a
further
argument
with
briefs
in
this
regard
or
re-argument
or
whether
it
should
go
back
to
the
master
for
further
evidence.
mr.
archibald
cox
with
some
hesitance.
mr.
wilmer
is
being
clearly
that
it
should
go
back.
i
don't
feel
quite
so
sure.
i
have
one
reason
to
be
candid.
i
--
if
i
were
the
master
that
had
worked
this
hard
and
adapted
this
certain
theory
then
it
was
sent
back
to
me
and
i
had
told
the
theories
are
all
wrong,
well
it
could
be
awfully
hard
for
me
to
really
put
my
back
into
it
justice
harlan
the
next
time
around
that
i
don't
mean
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
(inaudible)
other
and
it
certainly
implies
no
reflections
at
times,
had
rifted
it
all.
i'm
just
stating
the
way
i
would
react.
i
don't
know
how
he
would
react.
i
come
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there
are
certainly
some
things
on
which
further
evidence
would
have
to
be
taken.
and
i
guess
that
while
i
perhaps
taken
more
time
and
i
should
to
express
my
hesitance
as
to
whether
it
wouldn't
be
well
to
have
a
further
re-argument.
i
suppose
i
come
out
the
same
way
as
mr.
wilmer
here.
first,
if
we
go
to
the
tributary,
their
upstream
indian
reservations
as
their
rights,
we
would
contend
it
should
be
adjudicated
and
the
master
did
not
ask
the
states
to
put
in
all
their
evidence
of
those
questions.
so
clearly,
they
couldn't
be
adjudicated
without
that
evidence
being
put
in.
the
mainstream
controversy,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
dominant
fact
is
that
it
was
the
vast
expenditures
of
the
unites
states
for
the
hoover
dam
and
the
related
works
which
tend
to
colorado
river
that
made
so
much
of
its
waters
subject
to
beneficial
use,
irrigation
along
the
colorado
dates
back
to
very
early
indian
times.
but
until
the
building
of
boulder
dam,
virtually
all
of
those
projects
where
occurs
first
by
flood
and
then
by
drought.
for
example,
there
were
occasions
where
the
palo
verde,
one
of
the
first
(inaudible)
here
the
middle
of
the
lower
river
and
the
colorado
indian
reservation
irrigation
work
just
had
to
be
suspended
because
of
the
flood.
downstream
at
the
imperial
valley,
there
were
even
more
spectacular
droughts,
not
only
where
the
shortages
in
some
seasons
but
there
were
at
least
two
occasions
where
as
a
results
of
their
diversion
work,
the
colorado
river
changed
its
course
and
began
at
empty
into
salt
sea.
and
indeed,
one
can
say
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
taming
of
the
river
by
the
federal
government
that
it
might
well
be
emptying
into
the
salt
sea
today
and
the
imperial
valley
would
not
be
as
prosperous
and
luxurious
as
it
is.
the
major
step
in
the
development
of
the
project,
the
project
act
was
the
fall-davis
report
in
the
early
1920s.
i
mentioned
it
because
it
expressed
the
conclusion
that
everyone
concerned,
subscribed
too,
that
the
problems
of
the
colorado
river
were
in
such
magnitude
as
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
other
than
a
national
solution.
and
after
the
report
recommended,
the
building
of
a
dam
either
at
boulder
canyon
or
at
black
canyon
which
is
just
a
little
way
up
stream
and
also
and
further
canal
down
here
so
that
it
would
run
entirely
within
the
united
states
and
the
imperial
valley
uses
would
not
be
subject
to
recurring
difficulties
with
the
mexican
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
have
--
i
separate
it
from
the
term
(inaudible)
but
i
have
told
that
it's
just
further
up
above
boulder
canyon
and
i
think
it
would
be
between
boulder
canyon
and
bridge
canyon.
i
have
wondered
at
times
whether
they
aren't
--
black
and
boulder
aren't
two
dams
for
the
same
plates.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
if
they
are
separated,
it's
just
a
little
further
upstream
and
it's
not
as
far
up
as
bridge
canyon.
although
there
was
agreement
by
the
mid-20s
on
--
pretty
much
agreement
on
the
physical
aspects
of
the
project,
they
were
very
considerable
political
problems
which
have
been
described
the
upper
basin,
was
afraid
that
the
lower
basin
would
develop
first
and
rather
then
open
the
door
to
federal
expenditures
for
lower
basin
development,
they
wanted
to
have
something
set
aside
for
them.
arizona
was
afraid
that
california
would
develop
first
therefore,
she
wanted
to
be
protected
before
she
would
vote
in
the
support
of
this
project.
eventually,
the
political
difficulties
were
resolved
by
the
colorado
river
compact
and
the
enactment
in
1928
of
the
project
act.
and
when
then
had
constructed
this
very
elaborate
and
expensive
federal
work
is
not
only
starting
at
the
top
of
the
river,
in
the
hoover
dam
and
the
lake
mead
area
that
when
--
then
comes
down
to
davis
dam,
parker
dam,
palo
verde
which
the
irrigation
district
paid
for
and
finally
the
imperial
dam.
so
this
is
a
succession
of
works
all
along
the
river.
and
they
are
--
i
suggest
in
a
very
real
sentence,
the
works
which
control
and
make
manageable
and
therefore
useable
these
waters.
california
talks
a
great
deal
about
their
appropriations
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river.
i
think
two
things
should
be
emphasized.
in
the
first
place
that
the
water
actually
being
put
to
use
in
1928
and
this
is
a
rough
estimate
but
it
shows
the
proper
order
of
magnitude,
was
only
3.2
million
but
what
she
talks
about
today
as
existing
project
it's
not
water
that
is
being
used
today,
the
water
that
california
hopes
to
use
through
those
projects.
the
metropolitan
water
district
in
1928
was
a
gleam
in
somebody's
eye.
they've
spent
some
money
on
engineering.
it
was
a
big
thing.
but
there
had
been
no
physical
works
construct
to
take
the
water
out
of
the
colorado
river.
and
indeed
if
the
federal
government
had
not
come
along
with
this
project,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
this
simply
would
have
been
no
opportunity
to
divert
water
for
metropolitan,
los
angeles.
under
these
circumstances,
i
think
it's
unnecessary
to
argue
that
the
united
states
had
the
constitutional
power
to
allocate
the
waters
impounded
and
controlled
by
this
federal
works.
the
point
seems
to
me
to
be
established
by
the
ivanhoe
irrigation
district
case.
i
understand
it
not
to
be
contested
on
the
basis
of
what
was
said
here
on
the
oral
argument
and
i
don't
plan
that
(inaudible)
indians.
the
question
becomes
whether
the
united
states
congress
did
make
an
allocation
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
as
controlled
by
hoover
dam
and
the
related
work.
and
that
takes
us
to
a
more
detailed
examination
of
the
project
act
for
the
purpose
of
saying
whether
the
allocation
was
made.
the
core
of
the
act
i
find
in
sections
1,
5
and
6,
and
i
shall
refer
and
talk
into
the
act
to
the
print
in
the
back
of
the
master's
report.
that's
in
sets
one
that
we
can
all
conveniently
put
our
hands
on.
the
exact
words
of
section
1
are
not
important.
it
simply
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
construct,
operate
and
maintain
the
hoover
dam
and
the
all-american
canal
down
at
the
lower
end
of
the
river.
section
6
of
page
387
provides
how
the
dam
at
reservoirs
will
be
used.
the
dam
and
reservoir
provided
for
by
section
1
shall
be
used
first
for
river
regulation,
improvement
and
navigation
and
flood
control,
second
for
irrigation
and
domestic
uses
and
satisfaction
of
present
perfected
rights
pursuant
from
article
8
of
the
colorado
river
compact
and
third
for
power.
you
will
note
that
it
emphasizes
federal
ownership
and
operation
and
that
it
cause
for
the
both
protection
of
present
perfected
rights.
a
perfected
right
is
one
which
has
vested
in
the
sense
that
the
owner
of
the
right,
claimant
to
the
right
has
not
only
claimed
to
one
but
he
has
done
the
work
necessary
to
bring
the
water
to
his
land
and
to
apply
it
to
his
land.
and
it's
not
a
perfected
right
until
he
has
actually
made
beneficial
use
of
the
water.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
a
matter
of
definition
which
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
is
not
disputed
by
anyone,
certainly
as
the
master's
definition.
and
then
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
standard
would
be
for
that
state
law
i
think,
yes.
it
was
a
term
that
–
it
was
a
work
of
art
which
i
think
have
no
different
definition
anywhere.
so
that
when
i
said
it
would
be
state
law
it
was
–
it
would
be
the
general
law.
i
didn't
mean
to
indicate
that
one
must
refer
to
state
law
to
determine
whether
it
had
been
perfected.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
should
think
that
congress
could
use
words
that
were
familiar
in
--
in
water
law
with
a
federal
meaning.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
there
are
certainly
some
rules
with
respect
to
water
rights
laid
down
by
the
federal
statutes.
it
was
the
case
for
example
dealing
with
the
4860
acre
lot,
the
ivanhoe
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it
didn't
lay
down
to
federal
rules
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
is
important.
i
think
the
reason
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
(voice
overlap)
--
there
are
some
questions
with
respect
to
state
law
that
i
will
come
into
later.
i
don't
think
there's
any
controversy
about
whether
you
look
to
federal
law
or
give
a
federal
substantive
meaning
to
the
term
perfected
rights.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
could
be.
the
master
reserves
the
problem
of
what
qualified
as
present
perfected
rights.
he
gave
his
definition
and
said
a
perfected
rights,
that
think
this
is
true
at
every
state
is
one
where
the
water
has
been
applied
to
the
actual
use
on
the
land.
and
he
said
that
a
present
perfected
right
is
one
which
has
been
perfected
as
of
the
time
that
the
act
speaks
because
that's
the
only
thing
that
it
could
add.
it
meant
a
right
that
presently
been
perfected
in
1928.
mr.
archibald
cox
to
the
extent
that
it
was
being
beneficially
used,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
example,
mr.
ely
and
i
think
is
00
the
part
could
be
illustrated
with
reference
to
metropolitan
water
district.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
ely
would
say
that
the
metropolitan
water
district
had
a
prior
appropriated
right
going
back
to
the
time
they
filed
a
claim
of
some
time
in
the
mid20's
for
the
water
and
began
to
a
do
some
engineering
and
then
gradually
built
project.
and
under
california
law
hence
under
the
law
i
think
of
all
the
western
states
you
get
--
what
you
do
complete
--
if
you
do
complete
the
project
and
deprive
the
water,
it
relates
back
the
concept
of
present
perfected
rights
as
the
master
defined
it
would
exclude
those
for
every
use
of
the
water
came
after
1928,
and
would
say
that
it
covered
only
those
which
have
been
perfected
by
the
use
of
water
before
1928.
that's
why
i
say
that
1928
is
cut
off.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
would
mean
that
certain
rights
were
not
respected,
were
not
given
priority
for
the
purposes
of
this
act
in
accordance
with
the
state
law
of
water
act.
yes,
because
this
act
lays
down
a
federal
rule
with
respect
to
present
perfected
right.
it
doesn't
say
go
and
look
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
at
all.
i
think
it
bears
on
it
all
--
really
all
i
was
trying
to
suggest
was
that
section
6
contains
some
guidance.
it
does
a
partial
job
of
the
allocation.
it
says
that
you
are
to
honor
a
present
perfected
right,
that's
one
of
the
first
things.
and
i
may
say
that
the
legislative
history
cited
in
our
brief
quoting
to
congressman
douglas
from
arizona
and
congressman
colton
seems
to
me
that
it
makes
it
very
clear
that
not
only
this
sentence
in
section
6
but
the
critical
sentences
in
section
5
which
right
now
as
the
court
to
turn
do
contemplate
an
allocation
through,
“the
secretary
of
the
interior.
on
the
first
sentence
of
section
5,
on
page
384,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
hereby
authorized,
under
such
general
regulations
as
he
may
prescribe,
to
contract
for
the
storage
of
water
in
said
reservoir
and
for
the
delivery
thereof
at
such
points
on
the
river
and
on
said
canal
as
may
be
agreed
upon.”
running
on
down,
“contracts
respecting
water
for
irrigation
and
domestic
uses
shall
be
for
permanent
service
and
shall
conform
to
paragraph
(a)
of
section
4
of
this
act.
no
person
shall
have
or
be
entitled
to
have
the
use
for
any
purpose
of
the
water
stored
aforesaid
except
by
contract
made
as
herein
provided.”
this
seems
to
us
to
be
the
clear
as
to
indication
that
henceforth
right
charges
stem
to
have
contracts
with
the
secretary
but
the
secretary
is
to
determine
what
uses
shall
get
those
contracts.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
got
into
the
–-
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
come
to
it
a
little
later.
the
previous
sentence
which
i
slid
over
a
little
shall
perform
to
paragraph
(a)
of
section
4
of
this
act,
we
think
it
could
use
the
secretary
still
further
instructions
because
it
tells
him
that
he
is
to
make
his
contracts
within
the
arrangement
visage
by
section
4.
and
we
think
section
4
is
really
the
key
to
the
scheme
visage
by
the
project
act
reading
it
in
conjunction
with
the
provisions
that
i
sought
to
emphasize
out
of
section
5.
i
should
emphasize
i
think
that
section
4
in
its
interpretation
which
i'm
currently
now
in
some
detail
is
important
for
three
reasons.
it's
important
first
because
i
say
i
think
it
is
the
key
to
what
the
master
thought
and
we
thought
was
the
scheme
of
federal
apportionment.
its
interpretation
is
important
for
second
reason
because
whether
one
rejects
that
view
or
accepts
it.
section
4
imposes
a
limitation
on
our
friends
from
california.
it's
important
for
a
third
reason.
it's
part
of
the
secretary's
instruction,
therefore
a
part
of
the
limitations
on
his
power
and
we
must
of
course
show
that
his
contract
conform
to
those
constructions
so
that
this
in
essence
is
the
heart
of
this
part
of
the
case.
now,
the
issue
with
respect
to
section
4
as
i
understand
it
turns
essentially
a
part
with
meaning
of
words
found
on
page
382
down
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
page.
the
earlier
part
says
that
the
actual
not
take
effect
until
the
colorado
river
compact
has
been
ratified
or
until
california
has
accepted
this
limitation
upon
her
rights
that
her
users
shall
not
exceed
4,400,000
acre-feet,
waters
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
states
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact
plus
not
more
than
one-half
of
any
excess
or
surplus
waters
of
the
apportionment
by
said
compact.
the
master
took
the
view
as
i
have
said
before
that
this
reads
in
terms
of
a
universe
of
colorado
river
waters
that
it
does
not
include
the
tributaries
below
lake
mead.
california
takes
the
opposite
view.
california
imposes
--
that
we
briefed,
of
course,
with
the
best.
california
imposes
the
issue
in
a
way
which
it
seems
to
me
to
be
false.
california
says,
“do
these
keywords
waters
apportions
of
the
lower
basin
states
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact
referred
to
article
iii
(a)
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
well,
of
course
they
do.
i
don't
dispute
that.
i
don't
think
the
master
really
disputes
that.
the
master
as
i
understand
it
was
saying
essentially
this,
“congress
are
questionably
referred
to
article
iii
(a)
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
it
did
this
supposing
that
article
iii
(a)
apportion
to
the
lower
basin
7,500,000
acre-feet
out
of
all
the
waters
in
the
mainstream.”
the
congress
may
have
been
wrong
in
that.
he,
in
fact
--
the
master
goes
on
and
says,
“the
congress
was
wrong
in
that,
that
the
true
meaning
of
the
compact
is
that
article
iii
(a)
apportions
a
universe
or
apportion
7,500,000
out
of
the
universe
of
all
the
waters
in
the
lower
basin
including
the
gila.
but
congress
was
wrong”
so
the
master
says,
but
that
was
the
last
congress
put
a
meaning
which
is
quite
clear
from
the
legislative
history
and
for
the
words
of
the
project
act
on
the
compact
and
we
must
did
interpreting
the
project
act,
give
effect
to
what
congress
thought
it
meant
rather
than
what
we
now
in
our
after
the
event
wisdom
may
concluded
that
it
means.
and
i
think
what
can
put
the
issue
fairly
so
sickly
by
saying
that
the
question
is
whether
section
4
(a)
of
the
project
act
to
these
critical
words
should
be
read
to
incorporate
the
meaning
of
the
compact
had
which
congress
suppose
it
had.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
which
is
had
--
i
mean
which
suppose
the
compact
had.
as
the
matter
of
fact,
arizona
read
--
argues
that
congress's
assumption
as
the
meaning
of
the
compact
was
correct.
and
if
you
were
to
delve
into
that,
i
think
you
would
conclude
that
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
that
view.
if
arizona
is
right
in
its
meaning
about
compact,
then
there
is
now
a
departure
from
the
literal
meeting
of
the
section
4
(a)
of
project
act.
there's
now
departure
from
the
proper
meaning
of
the
compact
and
therefore
knowing
consistency
in
the
words.
if
the
master
is
right
in
saying,
"oh,
that's
not
the
meaning
of
the
compact"
then
of
course
we
are
not
putting
a
literal
interpretation.
compact
and
we
are
not
giving
the
quite
of
reference,
the
meaning
which
it
truly
has
but
rather
the
meaning
which
congress
opposed
it
to
have.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
say
that
it
is
not
only
--
not
only
unnecessary
but
would
be
inappropriate
to
determine
here
what
is
the
proper
meaning
of
the
compact.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
we
intended
to
disagree
with
arizona
with
that.
we
say
even
if
arizona
is
wrong
about
that,
the
master's
interpretation
of
the
project
act
is
still
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
take
it,
we
therefore
go
to
the
point
of
saying
that
we
are
willing
to
have
the
project
act
construed
on
the
assumption
that
arizona
is
wrong
and
california
is
right
about
the
compact.
really
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
and
all
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
that
the
meaning
of
the
compact
was
not
beyond
debate
and
that
therefore,
there
is
nothing
very
cruel
or
--
about
saying,
“we're
going
to
give
it
the
meaning
that
congress
thought
it
had”
and
--
rather
under
that
what
we
know
--
think
is
the
actual
meaning.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
implications
both
in
the
statute
and
in
the
legislative
history,
which
indicate
that
congress
refer
to
the
compact
supposing
that
if
apportioned
that,
therefore
as
way
of
apportioning
but
i
call
loosely
the
mainstream
water,
the
mainstream
and
the
waters
in
the
upper
tributaries
above
lake
mead.
i
found
the
first
indication
of
that
in
the
project
act
itself
as
the
master
said.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
three
--
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
once
you
doubt
first
that
no
one
spouses
here
a
completely
literal
meaning
of
all
the
documents.
for
example,
california
while
it
contents
for
a
literal
meaning
of
the
compact
and
a
literal
reading
of
the
words
4,400,000
acre-feet
of
the
waters
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
states
by
article
--
by
paragraph
a
of
article
iii
of
the
compact
says,
“we
should
read
those
literally
and
should
read
the
compact
literally.”
when
it
comes
to
the
phrase
not
more
than
one
half
of
any
excess
or
surplus
waters
unapportioned
by
a
said
compact,
it
doesn't
want
to
read
the
compact
literally
because
the
only
time
that
unapportioned
by
the
compact
comes
in
to
the
compact
is
it
one
of
the
closing
articles
where
it
says
it
preserves
those
waters
for
later
apportionment
after
1963.
at
the
3b
water
cannot
be
called,
we
think
water
unapportioned
by
the
compact
if
one
is
govern
by
the
literal
work.
now,
arizona
is
not
willing
to
have
a
literal
meaning
put
on
the
compact
and
have
it
been
literally
incorporated
into
the
project
act
neither
as
the
master
and
neither
as
we,
and
neither
are
we.
so
that
all
of
us
agreed
that
what
cannot
resolve
is
by
an
absolutely
literal
meaning
that
some
construction
is
necessary.
and
i
don't
think
anyone
advances
the
case
where
i
thought
by
saying,
"oh
well,
you
are
trying
to
go
behind
the
words,
what
has
to
go
behind
the
words?"
now,
the
second
thing
which
i
would
emphasize
about
the
project
act
itself
is
that
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
contains
three
strong
indications
that
the
master
is
correct
in
his
reading
of
the
first
paragraph.
subdivision
1
of
the
second
paragraph,
“the
states
of
arizona,
california,
and
nevada
are
authorized
to
enter
into
an
agreement
which
shall
provide
water.
that
those
7,500,000
acre-feet,
annually
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
by
paragraph
a
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact.”
now,
there
you
see,
congress
indicated
quite
plainly
that
it
sought
that
paragraph
a
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact
was
at
apportionment
of
7,500,000
acre-feet,
which
was
not
present
--
or
which
is
not
mentioned
in
the
first
paragraph.
and
the
two
paragraphs
are
quite
plainly
belong
together
as
opposite
have
of
the
same
apple
or
opposite
has
at
the
torn
piece
paper
and
indeed
if
the
edges
on
one
piece
of
paper
have
been
sculpt
and
rumpled
and
obliterated,
i
think
you
could
find
the
meaning,
find
their
true
shape
by
lucky
get
the
other
half
of
seeing
how
they
fit
together
because
this
obviously
were
meant
to
fit
together.
the
second
indication
that
is
important
is
that
enclosed
to,
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
says
that
the
state
of
arizona
may
annually
use
one-half
of
the
excess
or
surplus
waters
of
apportion
by
the
colorado
river
compact.
well
now,
currently
says
given
the
half
to
california,
half
to
arizona.
if
congress
has
in
mind
all
the
waters
in
the
lower
basin,
it's
authorized
these
three
states
to
take
all
of
them,
excluding
the
new
mexico,
utah
and
gives
that
nothing
at
all
which
is
something
which
would
seem
most
extra
ordinary.
furthermore,
if
that
were
the
meaning,
congress
is
undertaking
to
divide
between
these
two
states
without
qualification.
the
water
had
switched
the
compact
it
selves
speaks
off
as
subject
to
further
apportion
that
measure.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
read
the
whole
thing
on
the
colorado
river
water
excluding
the
gila
then
this
speaks
in
terms
of
the
states
that
had
accessed
to
the
river
water
and
of
course
leaves
the
tributaries
out
and
the
rights
of
new
mexico
and
utah
are
not
impaired.
third,
the
third
subdivision
that
the
state
of
arizona
shall
have
the
exclusive
beneficial
consumptive
use
of
the
gila
river
and
its
tributaries
within
the
boundaries
of
said
states.
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
further
is
required
to
be
said
to
show
that
this
obviously
gives
the
gila
to
arizona
in
addition
to
the
waters
apportioned
as
7,500,000
acre-feet,
add
one
half
of
the
excess
or
surplus.
now,
california
says
that
they
have
seen
this.
well,
this
is
just
a
specification
that
arizona
is
to
be
able
to
take
her
share
out
of
the
gila
that
out
of
arizona's
2,800,000
apportioned
by
the
earlier
subdivisions.
she
used
to
have
the
right
to
take
it
out
of
the
gila.
but
what
they
normally
looked
back
to
say
that
there
was
no
need
to
make
any
declaration
to
that
effect.
california
can't
take
water
out
of
the
gila
and
nevada
certainly
can't
take
water
out
of
the
gila.
furthermore,
as
you
read
this
second
paragraph
through,
i
think
it
will
become
quite
clear
that
each
of
this
is
an
addition
to
the
previous
subdivision
that
there
should
be
this
one
addition
which
is
a
sub-specification
of
the
meaning
of
an
earlier
subdivision,
just
as
not
in
keeping
with
the
general
scheme
of
gratitude.
california
has
a
broader
argument
as
i
understand
it.
she
says
in
her
brief,
i
think
i'm
stating
it
accurately
that
well
paragraphs
one
and
paragraph
two
of
section
4
(a)
were
alternatives,
it
was
never
thought
that
they
would
both
take
effect
at
the
same
time.
the
paragraph
2
contemplates
tri-state
compact,
if
you've
got
the
tri-state
compact,
there
would
be
no
problem
about
getting
ratification
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
and
therefore,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
the
limitation
act
ever
to
come
into
play.
i
think
that
there
are
several
complete
answers
to
that.
the
first
one
is
that
the
first
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
requires
ratification
of
the
compact
within
six
months
and
says
that
the
california
must
adopt
their
limitation
act
unless
the
compact
is
ratified
within
six
months.
there
is
no
such
time
limitation
of
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
(a).
in
other
words,
if
six
months
runs,
california
must
enact
its
limitation
act.
there
still
would
be
an
opportunity
for
a
tri-state
compact
under
the
second
paragraph.
now,
there's
an
indication
in
section
8
(b)
which
i
think
makes
it
fairly
clear
that
the
congress
did
visualize
that
the
tri-state
compact
might
be
negotiated
after
the
project
act
had
taken
in
effect.
and
that
would
mean
had
almost
surely
had
taken
effect
pursuant
to
california's
adopting
a
limitation
act.
section
8
(b)
contains
further
instructions
about
the
way
the
united
states
is
to
manage
the
river.
and
it
instructs
the
united
states
down
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
the
last
word
of
the
third
from
the
last
line.
shall
observe
and
be
subject
to
and
control
anything
contrary
not
withstanding,
by
the
terms
of
such
compact
if
any
between
the
states
of
arizona,
california
and
nevada,
skipping
some
words
which
may
be
negotiated
and
approved
by
said
states
and
to
which
congress
shall
give
its
consent
on
approval
on
or
before
january
1,
1929.
and
the
terms
of
any
such
compact
concluded
between
said
states
and
approved
and
consented
to
by
the
congress
after
said
date.
so,
in
that
section
talking
about
something
that
would
happen
after
january
1,
1929.
and
then
it
says,
provided
that
to
the
latter
case,
such
compact
shall
be
subject
to
all
contracts
if
any
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
under
section
5
gila
prior
to
the
date
of
the
approval
and
consent
by
congress.
so
there
was,
at
least
a
possibility
that
the
secretary
would
make
contracts
under
an
effective
project
act
before
the
tri-state
compact
became
affected.
i
may
say
this
is
also
further
evidence
that
congress
did
contemplate
the
secretary
making
an
interstate
allocation
because
it
says
that
any
later
arrangement
by
the
states
as
to
what
their
allocations
must
be
is
to
be
subject
to
the
contract
he
has
already
made,
which
certainly
speaks
in
terms
of
a
secretary
of
interstate
allocations.
then
the
third
reason
for
assuming
that
these
were
concluding,
that
these
two
paragraphs
of
section
4
(a)
go
together
is
in
the
legislative
history
because
i
shall
saw
in
a
moment
all
the
way
through
to
the
last
page,
the
paragraphs
where
in
terms
of
the
conjunctive
and
the
chains
that
was
made
to
make
the
second
paragraph
permissive.
it
was
not
in
terms
of
its
operating
as
an
alternative
to
the
first.
our
third
reason
for
thinking
that
the
statute
does
contemplate
a
federal
apportionment
is
simply
as
a
matter
of
commonsense,
the
commonsense
logic
to
the
situation.
congress
was
concerned
with
water
which
the
project
would
make
available
when
the
water
that
would
come
down
for
lake
mead
--
from
the
lake
mead.
and
what
would
be
more
natural
in
the
event
of
despite
between
the
state
than
for
congress
to
indicate
how
the
water
was
to
be
allocated
and
to
authorize
its
delegate
to
fill
in
the
gaps
that
it
left.
indeed,
i
find
out
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
as
i
understand
it,
under
most
of
this
project
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
secretary
has
frequently
decided
with
whom
he
would
contract.
i
don't
know
any
--
i
don't
know
of
any
decision
by
this
court
justice
douglas
that
says
the
states
determine
with
whom
the
secretary
shall
make
his
contracts.
the
court
has
held
at
the
gerlach
case
that
if
rights
are
destroyed
by
the
federal
project
rights
under
state
law
that
they
must
be
compensated.
but
the
court
--
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
understand
it,
certainly
therefore
isn't
what
was
done
in
the
gerlach
case
and
i
don't
recall
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
has
been
applied
to
the
exact
meaning
has
been
a
matter
of
some
argument.
the
farthest
i
know
the
court
had
gone
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
ickes
--
the
ickes
case
held
that
where
the
secretary
had
started
the
project
had
made
contract.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
in
those
--
in
that
case
as
in
the
ickes
case.
the
question
that
what
the
court
held
was
that
after
the
secretary
had
started
the
project,
after
the
secretary
had
made
appropriations,
after
he
had
let
contracts
with
the
users
then,
certain
rights
under
state
law
vested
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
simply
that
i
hadn't
reached
that
part
in
the
sequence
of
my
argument,
i'm
sorry.
i
think
that
since
i've
been
dealing
with
4,
if
i
might
finish
dealing
with
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
with
its
legislative
history.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
then
i
do,
i
assure
you
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
it
tend
to
come
to
sections
14
and
18
because
they
are,
of
course,
an
important
part
of
california.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
like
now
to
ask
of
course
to
turn
if
i
will
to
a
consideration
of
the
legislative
history.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
legislative
history
and
i
won't
--
i'm
trying
not
to
repeat
all
the
ground,
which
been
covered.
but
i
do
think
that
there
are
three
conclusions
that
emerged
up.
i
want
to
state
them
now
and
then
show
how
they
develop
because
the
important
thing
to
me
here
is
the
lesson
from
the
sequence
of
the
legislative
history
and
not
simply
reading
various
statements
by
the
senate.
the
three
things
which
i
ask
you
to
keep
in
mind,
there're
three
of
us
running
through
it,
what
i
think
were
assumptions
of
the
basis
of
which
everyone
discussed
this
case.
i
mean
the
statute
in
congress.
the
first
was
that
the
waters
of
the
gila
river
went
to
arizona
and
that
appears
as
an
assumption
all
the
way
through,
besides
the
sequence
show.
second,
that
what
congress
--
that
was
being
dealt
within
the
project
act
and
what
was
the
subject
matter
of
section
4
in
the
limitation
act
was
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
water
coming
down
the
mainstream,
deliberately
just
little
but
of
vague
because
i
think
the
senators
would
just
a
little
bit
vague.
i
said
three
things.
i
was
going
to
say
dealing
with
the
mainstream
waters
and
an
assumption
that
there
was
7,500,000
acre-feet
which
was
very
clearly
in
their
assumption
all
the
way
through.
the
background
of
controversy
was
outlined
and
outlined
very
accurately
as
i
see
it
by
mr.
wilmer.
the
problem
was
to
get
some
kind
of
assurance
for
the
upper
basin
states
that
the
lower
basin
states
wouldn't
appropriate
all
this
water
once
congress
had
made
it
usable
in
order
to
assure
them
since
they
anticipated
that
they
would
develop
later
that
there
would
be
some
water
left
for
it.
and
the
problem
also
from
california's
point
of
view
since
she
would
be
the
first
in
the
lower
basin
of
the
use
water
was
to
find
some
way
of
getting
arizona
to
go
along
or
to
state
converts
arizona
either
have
to
be
satisfied
sufficiently
to
go
along
or
else
there
had
to
be
some
kind
of
a
provision
written
into
the
act
whereby
all
the
rest
of
the
states
were
willing
to
say,
"well
arizona,
you
can
go
your
own
way,
fight
it
out.
we
are
satisfied
with
this
and
we
think
this
sufficiently
protects
the
upper
basin.”
now,
the
history
as
i
understand
the
evolution
of
problem
goes
back
at
least
until
1925.
in
that
year,
there
were
direct
--
i'm
using
arizona's
legislative
history,
the
fatter
one.
in
that
year,
there
were
direct
negotiations
between
arizona
and
california.
and
i
ask
you
first
to
look
at
the
proposals
made
by
california
in
1925
which
appear
beginning
at
page
144
of
the
arizona
legislative
history.
mr.
archibald
cox
144,
145,
i'm
going
to
begin
on.
article
iii
(a),
the
states
of
california
and
nevada
hereby
release
to
the
state
of
arizona
any
and
all
claims
of
every
kind
or
nature
to
the
use
of
the
waters
of
the
gila
river,
williams
river,
the
little
colorado
and
all
their
tributaries,
so
they
said
we
put
all
refers
for
arizona,
the
waters
would
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
page
145
of
the
arizona's
legislative
history.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
below
that
the
article
iii,
begins
just
about
the
middle
of
the
page.
mr.
archibald
cox
what
i
was
seeking
to
emphasize
was
that
the
first
bit
of
the
allocation
gave
arizona
the
gila.
now,
in
return
for
that,
california,
the
latter
part
of
that
paragraph,
gets
1,095,000
acre-feet
that
to
come
out
of
the
colorado
river.
then
nevada
was
given
her
300,000
acre-feet
that
nobody
has
ever
thought
about.
the
arizona
was
given
232,000
for
her
present
perfected
rights
then
california
was
given
something
over
2,000,000
for
her
present
perfected
right
and
the
rest
was
divided
equally.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
they
used
the
word
in
the
same
sense.
i
can't
find
any
direct
proof
of
this
but.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
they
were
using
it
with
reference
to
existing
beneficial
users
and
not
simply
that
claims
based
upon
hopeful.
because
as
i
--
i
can't
claim
be
an
expert
in
water
level
but
as
i
read
to
the
kenny
and
the
other
books,
giving
through
them,
looking
to
get
a
sense
of
the
used
word.
i
understand
them
to
speak
of
the
--
as
it
(inaudible)
rights
until
the
water
has
been
applied
to
gila,
throw
the
title
dates
back.
once
you
applied
it
to
use
but
if
it's
a
perfected
right,
you've
done
everything
necessary
to
perfect
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
they're
actually
using
the
water.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
what
perfect
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
and
therefore,
it
isn't
the
perfected
right
unless
waters
has
been
put
to
you.
now,
what's
master
have
to
answer
that
is
that
--
i
take
it
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
you
mean
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
did
bring
with
me
this
--
i
certainly
--
i
could
bring
--
will
bring
in
the
morning
a
statement
from
kenny
saying
that
if
perfected
right
is
one
where
everything
necessary
to
the
right
including
the
application
of
water
to
the
land
that
has
been
accomplished.
i
pretend
to
anything
--
no
ones
beyond
what
i
read
in
the
books
that
is
clearly
an
objection.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
the
points
that
i'm
tying
to
make
concerned
are
really
two.
one
is
gila
went
to
arizona.
mr.
archibald
cox
two,
that
they
then
and
divided
up
to
colorado
river,
meaning
the
mainstream.
now,
let's
look
at
arizona's
reply
to
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
arizona
got
232,000
and
in
addition,
they
got
half
of
the
colorado
river
and
to
subtracting
300,000,
232,000,
well
after
he
subtracting
the
amounts
allocated
in
california
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
they
got
a
lot
going,
oh
yeah.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
was
thrown
into
the
part
with
a
sense
in
that
stage.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
you
will
see
as
we
go
through
here
that
the
debate,
that
the
argument
began
to
focus
at
the
mainstream,
and
that
the
gila
was
assumed
to
be
what
something
what
arizona
got
all
the
time
and
leave.
they
are
now
going
to
find
about
the
division
of
something
else.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
now,
we
get
with
arizona,
we
get
with
arizona
proposed
that
begins
at
149
and
you
find
it
the
critical
words
over
150.
arizona
proposed
all
the
waters
and
tributaries
if
the
colorado
river
which
flow
into
the
river
below
lee
fairy,
or
hereby
allotted
and
appropriated
exclusively
in
perpetuity
to
the
states
in
which
such
tributaries
are
located,
and
this
must
specifically
meant
to
the
gila
went
to
arizona.
then
they
went
on
and
gave
about
a
300,000
acre-feet
and
divided
the
waters,
the
mainstream
waters
50/50,
but
i
emphasize
again
that
the
--
there's
no
fight
about
the
gila.
the
fight
is
about
who
gets
what,
out
of
the
mainstream.
then
hey
went
to
the
conference
because
the
so
called
governor's
conference
which
was
described
yesterday
and
we
know
for
the
legislative
history
that
when
they
went
there,
the
fight
had
narrowed
to
this
point.
the
california
wanted
4,600,000
out
of
the
river
leaving
300,000
for
nevada
and
the
rest,
which
at
that
state
would
have
been
3,000,000,
something
3,100,000
for
arizona.
arizona
--
and
arizona
takes
the
gila.
arizona
said,
"no.
california
should
have
only
4,200,000."
mr.
archibald
cox
this
was
a
following.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
27.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
1927,
the
governors'
conference
made
these
recommendations
that
appear
on
158
to
159.
and
they
divided
it
300,000
to
nevada,
3,000,000
to
arizona,
4,000,000
to
california.
and
in
addition,
they
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
arizona
was
to
get
the
tributaries,
and
then
they
found
out
in
paragraph
3
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
so
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
in
talking
about
the
allocation
at
the
governors'
conference.
they
are
talking
about
an
allocation
of
water
in
the
river
and
are
in
addition
giving
arizona
the
gila.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
second
paragraph
has
to
do
with
a
complicating,
and
i
find
complicated
question.
arizona
was
interested
into
two
things.
she
was
interested
in
getting
the
used
of
the
gila
as
against
the
rivals
in
the
united
states.
she
was
also
interested
in
having
the
gila
exempted
for
--
from
any
charge
for
getting
water
to
mexico.
as
a
practical
matter
you
see,
the
gila
either
has
to
be
used
in
arizona
or
used
virtually
in
mexico.
there
maybe
a
little
you
can
divert
out,
but
it's
pretty
much
one
or
the
other.
and
they
want
to
--
they
didn't
want
to
have
the
gila
charge
with
water
perfection.
and
you
will
find
that
also
in
one
of
the
subdivision
of
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4.
but
now,
after
the
governors'
conference
whereas
i
say
there
was
apparently
no
dispute
about
tributaries
that
where
attention
was
out
focusing
set
--
was
an
allocating
7,500,000
other
than
the
water
at
tributaries.
we
turn
to
the
situation
in
congress.
in
may
1928,
there
was
a
debate
in
the
senate
on
this
subject.during
the
course
of
that
debate,
senator
pittman
introduced
what
really
became
after
some
changes,
the
substance
of
section
4
(a)
of
the
project
act.
he
said
it
was
--
it's
found
at
pages
24
and
25
of
the
arizona
legislative
history.
he
said,
"this
was
based
on
the
recommendations
of
the
governors'
conference."
except
that
in
the
interim,
something
has
been
discovered.
they
discovered
that
they
forgot
about
1,000,000
acre-feet
in
the
mainstream
in
addition
to
the
7,500,000.
and
so
he
drew
up
a
proposal
which
attempted
to
incorporate
the
governor's
recommendations
plus
an
equal
division
of
that
additional
1,000,000
acre-feet.
and
if
you
read,
i
will
check
to
it
now.
if
you
read
his
proposed
amendment
through,
you
will
find
two
things
about
it.
first,
you
will
find
that
it
has
the
heart
to
these
two
paragraphs
in
section
4
(a)
and
that
they
are
plainly
treated
as
being
conjunctive
as
i
say,
opposite
halves
of
the
same
full.
because
to
the
middle
page
--
mr.
archibald
cox
about
24
and
25.
in
the
middle
of
page
25,
the
start
of
the
second
paragraph
as
it
then
read
said,
"the
said
ratified
act
shall
further
provide."
in
other
words,
it
was
going
to
be
something
in
addition
to
what
was
done
under
the
first
paragraph.
and
if
you
take
the
pittman
amendment
as
a
whole,
there
is
just
no
way
of
reading
it
other
than
saying
that
it
was
talking
about
the
mainstream
that
gave
the
gila
to
arizona,
which
i
can't
see
any
other
way
in
briefly.
we
come
to
the
climax
of
the
senate
debate
in
december,
1928.
there
was
a
very
revealing
debate
there
at
that
time,
and
the
act
was
passed
in
that
same
session
in
the
closing
days
of
the
year.
the
parliamentary
situation,
there
is
a
little
impart.
there
was
bill
before
the
senate,
which
has
been
introduced
by
senator
johnson
of
california.
it
proposed
to
break
this
impasse
by
giving
california
4,600,000
acre-feet.
i
didn't
say
anything
about
gila
and
so
far
as
i
can
see,
it
didn't
say
anything
very
revealing
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
issue
before
us
except
that
it
used
4,600,000
acre-feet.
then
senator
hayden
introduced
as
amendment
to
the
johnson
bill.
an
amendment
is
exactly
the
words
of
this
pittman
proposal.
it
would
have
differed
from
the
california
proposal
from
the
johnson
bill
clearly
and
then
it
limited
california
to
4,200,00.
it
would
also
seem
to
me
but
i'll
take
judicial
argument
if
that
clearly
gave
the
gila
the
tributaries
of
arizona
and
we
clearly
come
--
clearly
concentrated
at
the
mainstream.
the
debate
that
--
debate
will
call
it
became
one
over
the
difference
between
california's
claim
to
4,600,000
plus
one
half
of
the
surplus.
and
arizona's
insistence
that
california
should
have
over
4,200,000
plus
one
half
of
the
surplus.
there
was
very
little
explicit
mentioned
of
the
fact
but
it
seems
plain
that
everyone
at
that
time
was
talking
about
7,500,000
acre-feet
plus
an
uncertain
surplus
of
mainstream
one.
i
say
that's
clear
because
of
the
two
halves
to
the
hayden
proposal
if
you
read
both
halves,
if
you
read
one
in
the
light
of
the
other.
the
gila
necessarily
was
not
included.
i
would
say
it
furthermore
because
the
light
of
the
governor's
recommendations.
no
one
who
was
taking
in
terms
of
the
apportionment
of
anything
other
than
the
mainstream
could
possibly
have
said
as
a
number
of
them
did
in
that
state
that
the
difference
was
oddly
between
4,600,000
and
4,200,000.
now,
there
were
in
fact
expressions
from
all
the
senators
prominently
engaged
with
the
debate.
let
me
say
the
word
in
fact
expressions
from
this
--
from
the
senators
most
prominently
engaged
in
the
debate
would
seem
to
me
to
indicate
that
they
all
knew
or
assume
that
they
were
talking
about
mainstream
one.
senator
pittman
is
quoted
on
page
67
of
the
arizona
legislative
history.
there
is
practically
nothing
involved
except
in
dispute
between
the
states
of
arizona
and
california
with
regard
to
division
of
the
increased
water
that
will
be
impounded
behind
the
proposed
dam.
that
is
all.
now
skipping
down
to
the
end
of
the
quotation
of
the
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
water
let
down
that
river
they
have
gotten
together
within
400,000
acre-feet.
they've
got
to
get
together
that
not
congress
should
bring
them
together.
senator
hayden
repeatedly
spoke
of
the
amounts
of
water
to
be
received
from
the
colorado
river.
senator
johnson
himself
--
i'm
now
reading
from
70
(inaudible)
record
at
the
page
237,
spoke
of
what
was
the
fight
was
about.
he
said
that
the
discussions
relating
to
the
use
of
water
in
california,
in
denver
and
indeed
here
and
elsewhere,
it
is
the
--
it
is
only
the
mainstreams
that
your
honors
will
recall
that
has
been
discussed.
the
tributaries
of
the
colorado
river
in
arizona
have
a
flow
of
at
least
3,500,000
acre-feet.
arizona's
claim
in
writing
on
some
occasions
that
it
runs
6,000,000.
so
what
it
is
proposed
that
california
will
take
4,200,000
acre-feet
and
arizona
at
3,000,000
acre-feet
plus
one
half
at
each
instance
from
the
surplus
water.
it
means
in
reality
that
california
shall
be
accorded
4,200,000
acre-feet
plus
one
half
of
the
surplus
and
then
at
least
6,500,000
acre-feet
plus
one
half
of
the
surplus
shall
go
to
arizona.
so
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
representing
california
that
they
were
talking
about
the
mainstream.
and
then
he
says,
a
little
further
down,
“to
divide
the
mainstream
4,600,000
acre-feet
to
california
and
2,600,000
acre-feet
to
arizona
still
gives
arizona
more
than
60%
of
the
water
from
the
colorado
river.”
he
meant
and
tributaries
there
clearly
or
nearly
two
thirds
there
up.
so
that
--
i
think
this
--
well,
it's
to
70
congressional
record
237.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
was
senator
johnson
of
california.
so
we
have
expressions
from
senator
pittman,
senator
hayden
and
senator
johnson
who
are
certainly
three
of
the
main
figures
of
the
debate.
now,
california
quotes
in
her
brief,
a
statement
from
senator
phipps
of
colorado
saying,
"well,
you've
got
to
remember
that
arizona
gets
the
water
to
the
gila."
as
i
read
that,
he
was
saying
that
in
deciding
between
4,600,000
and
4,200,000,
you've
got
to
remember
that
arizona
is
also
getting
the
gila.
that's
what
senator
johnson
was
arguing
that
in
addition
to
what
we
do
here
or
as
the
gila
for
arizona.
now
at
that
this
stage,
there
was
a
change
in
the
parliamentary
situation.
do
you
remember
i
said
it
was
the
johnson
bill,
in
which
itself
was
a
substitute
for
the
pending
house
bill.
and
then
there
had
been
the
hayden
amendment.
senator
phipps
then
offered
an
amendment
which
was
designed
to
give
california
4,600,000
instead
of
the
4,200,000
which
was
proposed
in
the
depending
hayden
amendment.
there
could
have
been
a
vote
or
straight
out
on
the
phipps
amendment
as
a
matter
of
parliamentary
law.
well,
the
senate
decided
not
to
do
that
because
there
were
two
differences
according
to
hayden
amendment
and
the
phipps
amendment.
one
difference
was
in
the
amount
of
water
specified
in
the
california
limitation
act.
the
other
difference
was
that
while
the
hayden
amendment
contemplated
a
seven
state
compact
but
it
would
have
still
made
the
whole
act
in
addition
to
arizona's
ratification.
the
phipps
amendment
contemplated
a
six
state
compact
plus
the
california
limitation
act.
that
senator
hayden
desired
to
have
these
two
issues
was
voted
on
separately.
and
so
what
they
did
was
they'd
agreed
that
senator
hayden
would
withdraw
his
amendment
that
the
phipps
amendment
would
be
offered
proposing
4,600,000
and
a
six
state
compact.
and
then
senator
hayden
simply
moved
to
strike
out
the
4,600,000
and
substitute
the
4,200,000.
senator
phipps'
motion
lost.
senator
bratton
then
proposed
the
4,400,000
and
that
motion
was
carried
and
was
certain
perfected
changes
the
phipps
amendment
became
the
first
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
of
the
project
act.
now,
i
repeat
once
more
that
the
whole
debate
seems
to
me
to
focus
especially
when
one
remembers
the
prior
historical
incidence
and
the
assumptions
in
the
prior
proposal
that
they
were
allocating
the
mainstream
and
the
gila
would
go
to
arizona
as
indeed,
remember
it
did
clearly
in
the
second
paragraph
of
the
hayden
amendment.
but
at
that
point,
senator
hayden
now
has
left
with
the
second
paragraph
of
his
amendment
hanging.
so
he
rose
and
moved
that
the
second
paragraph
of
his
original
amendment
be
added
to
the
phipps
amendment
which
had
already
been
adopted.
you
will
find
the
second
paragraph
which
is
much
like
--
which
is
identical
with
the
second
paragraph
of
the
pittman
proposal
and
the
original
hayden
amendment
set
forth
on
page
98
and
99
of
the
arizona
legislative
history.
the
part
that
i
wish
to
emphasized
is
in
his
statement
reprinted
over
on
page
102
where
he
said,
“the
first
part
of
my
amendment
is
a
mere
corollary
to
the
amendment
offered
by
the
senator
from
colorado.
it
provides
that
the
remainder
of
the
7,500,000
acre-feet
there
apportion
to
this
--
there
shall
be
apportioned
to
the
state
of
nevada
of
300,000
acre-feet
to
the
state
of
arizona
2,800,000
acre-feet,
which
combined
with
the
4,400,000
which
the
state
of
california
will
use
completely
exhaust
the
7,500,000
acre-feet
apportioned
in
perpetuity
to
the
lower
basin.”
now
remember,
he
was
describing
the
first
part
of
an
amendment
which
in
the
third
part
gave
arizona
the
gila
in
addition
to
all
of
this,
as
is
the
case
in
the
third
part
of
the
second
paragraph
of
4
(a)
statement.
so
then
it
grew
up
opposition
to
senator
hayden's
proposal
in
only
one
respect
that
this
goes
to
provide
for
judge
stewart
phrase
later.
one
of
the
subdivisions
of
senator
hayden's
proposal
said
that
the
gila
should
be
free
from
any
burden
with
respect
to
the
perspective
of
mexican
treaty
that
senator
johnson
objected
very
vigorously
to
that.
he
didn't
object
so
far
as
i
can
find
anywhere
in
the
record
to
the
recitation
that
arizona
was
getting
the
gila
in
addition
to
the
apportionment
made
by
the
phipps
amendment.
indeed,
the
language
of
the
debate
indicates
that
he
knew
very
well
what
had
happened
and
that
the
only
thing
he
was
currently
fighting
about
was
the
attempt
to
exempt
the
gila
from
part
of
the
burden
of
the
mexican
treaty.
at
70
conversional
record,
beginning
at
page
466,
what
has
a
long
debate
to
dial
--
to
find
myself
to
his
little
(inaudible)
as
i
can
between
senator
hayden
and
senator
johnson
about
this
proposal.
in
the
course
of
it,
mr.
johnson
said,
"what
arizona
says
that
she
has
but
2,800,000
acre-feet
of
water."
that's
what
she
just
had
been
given
by
the
phipps
amendment.
“to
that,
there
must
be
added
the
gila
river
with
its
3,000,000
and
3,500,000.”
that's
very
little.
“and
then
it
will
be
found
that
arizona
has
in
reality
two
thirds
of
the
water
of
the
colorado
itself.”
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
"if
we
should
exempt
as
possibly
we
may
--
should
this
amendment
be
inducted,
the
gila
river
from
any
burden
or
any
servitude
that
might
thereafter
attached
because
of
water
to
mexico.”
we
should
then
exempt
from
burying
its
just
share
to
paraphrase.
and
a
little
later,
there
is
a
--
in
the
colloquy
between
mr.
hayden
and
mr.
johnson.
mr.
hayden
said,
“the
senate
has
settled
it
by
a
vote
that
california
may
have
4,400,000
acre-feet
of
that
water.
it
follows
logically
that
if
that
demand
is
to
be
conceded
as
everybody
agrees,
the
remainder
is
2,800,000
acre-feet
for
arizona.
that
settles
that
part
of
the
controversy.
senator
johnson,
“how
much
from
the
gila?”
“whatever
is
in
it",
mr.
hayden
replied."
that
is
ours
anyhow.
it's
yours
anyhow?"
“yes.”
“then
your
amendment
is
of
no
use?
if
that
is
yours
anyhow
then
you're
already
on
your
tributaries,
what
are
you
putting
this
in
for?”
and
the
reply
was
that,
“i'm
putting
in
to
except
it
from
the
mexican
treaty.”
there
are
two
different
problems
here.
one
is
the
allocation.one
is
the
burden
of
treaty.
and
when
he
said
that's
the
burden
of
the
treaty,
mr.
johnson
said,
“that's
exactly
what
i
objected.”
and
then
mr.
johnson
after
bringing
that
out
and
saying
he
objected
said,
"alright,
i'll
accept
your
figure
of
3,500,000
for
the
gila."
now,
in
the
division
of
mr.
johnson,
now,
in
the
division
of
water
with
senate
sought
it
to
impose
yesterday,
arizona
had
2,800,000
acre-feet
and
3,500,000
from
the
gila,
did
it
not?”
“that
is
correct.”
then
mr.
johnson
goes
on
and
said,
"then
you
wish
to
put
on
the
california
and
arizona
equally
the
burden
of
the
mexican
treaty"
and
says
that's
what
he
objects
it.
so
it
seems
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
understand
it's
on
page
119.
i
couldn't
find
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
some
of
it
--
i
couldn't
find
it
all
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir.
it's
70
congressional
record,
beginning
on
page
466.
i
was
skipping
over
about
three
pages,
466
to
469
would
cover
it.
i
may
say
incidentally
that
the
full
debate
of
this
december
session
of
the
senate
is
not
terribly
long
and
i
found
it
myself
more
convenient
to
read
it
in
here
that
--
while
this
is
a
very
helpful
job
of
excerpts,
really
isn't
so
long
that
one
can't
get
the
feel
of
it
and
going
through
the
whole
thing
in
reasonably
short
time.
the
part
that
i
was
seeking
was
one
further
thought
that
i
was
wish
to
emphasize
that
in
this
debate,
after
senator
hayden
and
senator
johnson
got
at
loggerheads
about
burden
of
the
mexican
treaty,
then
senator
pittman
came
in
and
said,
"well,
i
don't
think
it's
right
to
impose
a
tri-state
compact
terms
of
which
we
have
specified
as
a
condition
of
this
active
congress
being
effective.
let's
tell
the
states
that
they
can
enter
into
this
compact
and
we'll
give
them
advance
ratification.
but
let's
not
impose
it
on
all
three
of
them
the
way
we
imposed
the
california
limitation
act
on
california."
and
senator
hayden
agreed
to
that.
and
they
changed
was
then
made,
which
you
now
find
in
the
beginning
of
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
which
says
the
three
states
may
enter
into
this
treaty
rather
than
they
must.
but
it
would
have
been
extraordinary
at
that
stage
having
treated
this
as
two
parts
of
the
same
thing,
all
the
way
through
to
have
jumped
and
made
this
permissive
thing
an
alternative
to
the
first
paragraph,
and
then
the
discussion
was
certainly
in
terms
of
being
two
parts
of
the
whole.
and
i
submit
therefore
that
the
meaning
of
one
throws
a
great
deal
of
light
indeed
if
it
is
not
controlling.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir,
it
did.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
in
--
except
for
the
first
few
words
which
in
--
are
you
in
the
act
today?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
was
the
same
as
this,
the
same
as
the
act
mr.
justice
black
except
at
the
very
beginning
what
is
now
at
the
bottom
of
page
382
of
the
master's
report,
where
it
said
the
states
of
arizona,
california
and
nevada
are
authorized
to
enter
into
an
agreement.
it
said
instead
the
ratifying
act
--
that
the
ratifying
act
is
becoming
affected
should
be
conditioned
upon
they're
entering
into
such
an
agreement.
otherwise,
it
was
the
same.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
would
be
hard
to
say
that
it
is
irrelevant
and
i
think
it
led
some
comfort
to
the
california
argument
that
congress
apparently
was
not
willing
to
go
the
whole
way
here
and
say
to
each
of
the
three
states,
"you
must
take
this."
and
we
do
allocate
this.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
it
is
quite
plain
that
congress
came
very
close
to
that
so
far
as
california
was
concerned,
they
didn't
say,
"you
must
take
this."
they
said,
"here
is
the
apportionment
we
made.
if
you
want
the
project,
you
must
take
this."
and
california
enacted
the
limitation
act
that
did
consent
this
so
that
you
had
california's
agreement.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
still
was
something
added
for
the
same
reasons
since
california's
consent
came
in.
there
was
something
less
and
then
an
out
and
out
congressional
compulsion
with
respect
the
apportionment.
they
said,
"you
can
take
the
choice
between
what
the
apportionment
we
proposed
here
or
nothing
at
all."
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
an
indication.
i
wouldn't
deny
it.
i
don't
think
that
it's
anywhere
enough
to
describe
the
theory
especially
as
what
congress
did
do
here,
taking
the
language
to
the
project
act
at
the
legislative
history
together,
and
i
do
emphasize
that
the
california
was
given
a
choice.
they
could
ascend
not
ascend
before
the
project
act
became
effective.
now,
so
far
as
nevada
was
concerned,
there
was
never
any
argument
that
she
was
going
to
get
300,000
acre-feet.
arizona
possibly
retained
some
rights
whatever
they
might
be.
she
was
told
in
effect,
you
could
come
along
on
these
terms
or
you
can
stay
out
and
fight.
she
chose
to
stay
out
and
fight
after
getting
nowhere
from
protected
period
and
she
finally
chose
to
come
in
and
signed
the
contract
with
the
secretary.
there's
one
other
california
argument
that
i
think
i
should
deal
with
that
california
says
that
if
there
was
just
8,500,000
acre-feet
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
by
the
compact,
not
the
act,
the
compact.
and
if
we
assumed
that
there
are
2,000,000
acre-feet
in
the
gila
then
california
would
not
get
the
4,400,000
acre-feet.
the
congress
plainly
contended
third
half
and
therefore,
she
argues
that
this
camp
have
been
what
congress
intended.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
congress
of
california
--
now,
i
don't
think
that's
quite
right.
let
me
restate
it.
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
you
but
let
me,
if
i
restate
it
what
i
tried
to
say
i'll
make
it
clear.what
california
says,
"we
were
intended
at
a
minimum
yet
4,400,000
acre-feet."
now,
the
most
you
can
say
that
was
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
by
the
compact
is
8,500,000
acre-feet.
this
means
that
if
we
say
2,000,000
for
the
gila,
it
would
be
6,500,000
in
the
mainstream.
and
if
arizona
gets
the
gila
plus
this
allocation
of
the
mainstream
according
to
master's
report.
this
allocation
of
6,500,000
in
the
mainstream
then
we
won't
get
the
4,400,000
that
congress
clearly
intended
as
to
have.
and
therefore,
the
assumption
that
the
gila
is
to
be
excluded
from
the
accounting
must
be
wrong.
now,
i
think
there
are
two
faults,
two
evident
faults
in
that
argument.
in
the
first
place,
congress
assault
beyond
question
that
there
were
7,500,000
acre-feet
available
in
the
mainstream.
and
with
respect
to
determining
what
was
the
intent
of
congress
during
the
course
of
this
debate
of
what
can
make
an
assumption
contrary
to
the
assumption
that
congress
was
making.
the
second
difficulty
with
this
is
that
saying,
"two
million
--”
that
it
making
the
compact
counting
and
charging
2,000,000
for
the
gila,
this
assumes
a
disputed
question
about
the
way
in
terms
of
water,
the
gila
uses
are
to
be
charged
in
disputed
question
as
to
whether
the
charge
is
the
depletions
of
the
mainstreams
fly
or
divergence
less
returns
to
the
stream,
upstream.
another
assumption
that
make
which
is
certainly
debated
is
that
the
reservoir
losses
are
not
to
be
included
in
the
account,
the
evaporation
that
mr.
ely
was
talking
about.
but
if
one
goes
to
a
compact
counting,
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
under
the
master's
theory.
that
question
too
would
have
to
be
looked
at.
but
i
think
that
the
really
basic
point
is
that
the
congress
--
one
of
the
three
essentials
assumptions
it
made
was
that
there
were
7,500,000
acre-feet.
and
therefore,
you
can't
interpret
what
the
senator
said
by
making
a
different
assumption
what
they
do.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
supposed
that
the
--
i
think
to
say
about
itself
that
the
senators
did
mean
7,500,000
acre-feet
at
lee
ferry.
the
master
says
that
they
didn't.
we
don't
think
that
it
is
really
necessary
to
decide
in
order
to
resolve
the
present
case.
what
gets
appealing
that
there
was
a
--
that
they
didn't
think
much
about
this
probable
evaporation
loses
or
other
stream
loses
between
lee
ferry
and
lake
mead,
and
that
maybe
they
didn't
think
about
the
additions
in
it.
they
spoke
more
generally
of
water
let
down.
well,
that
would
seem
to
me
lee
ferry
but
it
was
simply
in
terms
of
water
in
the
river
without
this
kind
of
precise
measurement,
which
is
certainly
necessary
here
in
the
writing
the
appraisal.
so
the
way
it
lies
in
my
mind
is
that
the
core
of
their
meaning,
it
was
made
mainstream
and
not
the
gila
is
presently
clear
but
their
precise
definition
of
mainstream
is
pretty
hard
to
get
out
of
the
debate.
if
there
is
anything
that
prevails,
it
is
the
7,500,000
coming
down
at
lee
ferry
as
you
suggest.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
would
--
one
way
--
yes
it
were
or
one
could
go
step
further
and
say
the
master
rejected
it.
and
say
that
they
equated
3
(d)
with
3
(a)
that
they
really
didn't
see
there
was
any
difference,
that
adds
it
to
this
and
they
could
go
here
that's
going
to
be
average
of
7,500,000
over
ten
years,
a
boulder
dam
is
--
it's
perfect.
it's
going
to
be
given
out
in
the
big
years
and
the
bad
years.
well,
if
you
get
75,000,000
ten
years,
you
get
7,500,000
each
year
that
you
could
use
that
7,500,000.
mr.
archibald
cox
just
as
a
matter
of
physical
facts,
they
can
be
correlative
because
you
have
evaporation
---
mr.
archibald
cox
evaporation,
transpiration,
plant
is
taking
it
off
--
mr.
archibald
cox
you
have
additional
tributaries
coming
in
and
there
is
--
you
can't
physically
get
it
together.
now,
there
are
various
ways
you
could
lessen
the
--
lessen
the
difference,
narrow
the
gap
if
it
were
necessary
to
relate
what
is
done
here
to
the
compact.
for
example,
you
could
say
mr.
justice
stewart
that
evaporation
out
of
lake
mead
is
chargeable
to
each
of
the
states
as
part
of
their
beneficial
consumptive
us.
after
all
the
upper
basin,
if
you
think
of
yourself
as
being
in
colorado.
you
might
very
well
say
to
arizona.
if
you
thought
it's
going
to
store
the
water
there
for
ten
years
so
that
half
has
been
evaporated,
it's
not
fair
to
charge
that
to
be.
you're
the
fellow
who's
--
whose
benefit
is
being
held
there,
that
should
be
charged
to
you.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
as
i
said
if
you
reject
it
the
master's
theory
down
on
a
readable
shape.
i
had
put
it
in
absolute
terms
that
what
has
to
face
this
kind
of
question
and
his
recommendations
concerning
it,
i
think
would
that
be
accepted
by
all
parties
as
they're
willing
to
accept
if
the
thesis
of
his
decree
stands.
i've
now
completed
with
the
legislative
history
simply
summarizing
very
briefly
the
conclusions
that
i
draw
from
it,
are
that
all
the
way
through
after
those
early
negotiations,
there
was
an
assumption
that
the
waters
apportioned
by
article
iii
(a)
for
7,500,000
million
feet
of
mainstream
water
and
that
the
excess
was
the
mainstream
waters
in
excess
of
7,500,000
acre-feet
which
would
include
the
article
iii
(b)
(1)
since
not
everything
in
excess
of
7,500,000
acre-feet
and
borrowing
the
questions
about
the
diversion
above
lake
mead
that
of
course
is
the
conclusion
that
the
master
has
written.
conversely,
it
seems
to
me
to
have
been
assumed
and
agreed
by
everyone
concerned
from
the
initial
direct
discussions
between
arizona
and
california
on
that
arizona
was
getting
the
gila
in
addition
to
whatever
allocation
was
made
out
of
the
mainstream.
now,
i
come
to
the
question
that
was
raised
earlier.
and
that
is
don't,
sections
14
and
18,
indicate
that
congress
was
not
making
a
federal
allocation
but
rather
that
the
entire
right
--
the
entire
question
was
to
be
decided
in
accordance
with
state
law.
the
master
partly
accepted
and
partly
rejected
that
notion.
so
far
as
the
interstate
controversy
is
concerned,
he
wholly
rejected
the
notion
and
as
he
said,
“there
is
nothing
in
section
14
and
nothing
in
section
18
that
quite
in
a
different
direction
that
all
the
indications
in
sections
4,
5
and
6
that
there
is
to
be
a
contractual
allocation
by
the
secretary.”
he
accepted
the
notion
justice
douglas
to
this
extent.
he
did
say
that
once
the
secretary
decides
with
whom
he
will
contract
from
thereon,
the
relative
priorities
between
those
people
intrastate
is
to
be
determined
according
to
state
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
the
difference
between
that
and
what
i
just
said.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
didn't
say
--
i
said
that
that
was
what
he
said.
i
didn't
say
i
agreed
with
it.
i
said
that
--
i
meant
to
say
that
that
was
what
he
said
that
he
said
--
let
me
repeat
so
we
could
go
--
start
off
from
the
place
that
he
said
that
interstate,
the
act
in
the
secretary's
allocation
control.
mr.
archibald
cox
intrastate,
the
secretary
has
the
right
to
determine
with
whom
he
will
contract
at
least
in
arizona
that
in
nevada,
he
doesn't
have
that
right
because
he's
already
contracted
for
the
full
amount
with
the
state
of
nevada
that
once
he
does
contract
with
users
then
their
relative
priorities
shall
be
determined
according
to
state
law.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
master's
brief.
now,
we
agreed
that
the
master
is
correct
so
far
as
the
proposition
that
sections
14
and
18
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
interstate
allocation
is
concerned.
we
agree
that
the
master
was
correct
in
sharing
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
the
power
and
duty
to
determine
who
will
use
the
water
within
arizona.
we
think
that
the
nevada
contract
is
not
a
contract
with
users
and
the
secretary
was
directed
to
allocate
the
water
by
contracts
with
users
and
that
therefore
and
a
nevada
person
wish
he
could
use
the
water
must
to
get
a
contract
with
the
secretary.
as
to
the
relative
priorities
among
people
who
have
contracts
with
the
secretary,
we
think
that
it's
a
matter
of
principle
that
the
master
was
wrong.
we
think
that
that
question
is
one
to
be
determined
as
part
of
the
contractual
system.
however,
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
rather
than
by
state
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
after
the
contracts
have
been
made.
then
a
fortiori,
we
think
state
law
doesn't
determine
who
should
get
the
contract.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
federal
government
as
i
had
recalled
it
makes
a
complete
determination
about
contracts
for
the
sale
of
power
here
but
i
--
i
haven't
concentrated
on
those
sections.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
expressed
provisions
in
the
act
justice
black,
and
i
think
anything
i
might
say
now
would
only
be
confusing.
let
me
overnight
review
those
and
try
to
answer
your
questions,
because
i
got
to
concentrate
on
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
although
there
are
far
more
detailed
provisions
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
with
respect
to
the
power.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
think
the
secretary
--
our
position
in
principle
is
the
secretary
shall
whose
briefs
determined
with
whom
he
will
contract
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--regardless
of
state
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
regardless
of
state
law.
now,
i
would
like
to
follow
that
right
--
mr.
archibald
cox
all
--
all
i
want
to
try
to
get
you
to
do
now
is
not
to
hold
the
upstream.
that
is
our
position,
no
question
about
it.
what
--
what
we
say
is
that
this
is
not
a
question
which
it
is
necessary
to
decide
in
order
to
resolve
this
controversy
and
indeed
that
it
would
not
be
timely
to
decide
it,
that
by
a
reason
to
take
--
that
it
would
--
is
not
necessary
and
would
be
untimely
is
that
we
don't
have
any
specific
controversy
here
where
there
is
a
clash
between
some
decision
taken
by
the
secretary
and
some
alleged
provision
of
the
state
law.
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
there
must
be
some
room
for
state
law
in
this
overall
system.
your
honor
pointed
in
the
--
what
are
the
interstate
apportionment
cases
that
once
the
contracts
had
been
left
and
the
users
had
contracts
that
then
the
state
law
took
hold
of
that.
and
as
i
understand
it's
something
for
the
contract,
the
time
of
the
character
of
the
users,
rights
and
subject
to
contracts,
the
rights
between
users.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
think
that
you
do
have
to
consider
whether
sections
14
and
18
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
yes.
but
you
don't
have
to
--
i
must
have
become
confused.
i
said
you
don't
have
to
make
any
decision
now
about
the
relative
rights
of
users
within
the
same
state
other
than
the
claim
about
the
indian
reservation.
what
--
what
concerns
me
frankly
here
is
that
i'm
very
reluctant
to
argue
in
a
generality
how
far
the
state
law
control
the
secretary's
rights
to
contract
intrastate.
i
can
think
of
a
great
many
difference
specific
questions
that
might
come
up.
for
example
justice
douglas,
the
secretary
has
entered
into
a
number
of
contracts
on
reclamation
projects
providing
that
the
event
of
a
shortage
for
water
on
those
projects,
the
users
so
far
should
be
ratably
diminished.
now,
if
we
have
that
specific
question
that
we
could
debate
whether
state
law
prevailed
over
those
contrasts.
if
we
had
a
question
as
to
--
such
as
i
think
that
come
up,
if
my
memory
is
right
in
the
some
of
the
lower
courts
as
to
whether
a
state
can
say,
“no,
you
shade
the
water
to
enable
the
establishment”
then
we
could
debate
on
that
specific
question.
but
what
i
fear
the
master
has
done
here,
and
i'm
not
sure
if
they've
been
through
because
the
decree
doesn't
reflect
this
to
certain
extent,
has
to
say
generally
without
reference
to
any
specific
dispute
of
rights
interstate
determined
by
a
state
law
what
will
--
mr.
archibald
cox
up
to
a
selling.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
in
fact
there
were
two
kinds
of
claims
of
course
with
respect
to
water,
one
was
for
what
we
call
--
had
been
going
prior
perfected
rights,
the
good
claims,
the
ones
--
and
then
there
were
the
--
what
i
called
the
gleam
in
the
metropolitan
water
district's
eye.
the
things
it
hoped
to
do
and
it's
take
out
our
which
there
were
some
debate
in
the
senate
about
how
good
those
were.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
mislead
you.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
i
said
there
was
any
discussion
of
present
perfected
rights,
i
misled
you.
i
meant
to
say
there
was
a
discussion
--
they
--
the
phrase
perfected
rights
was
used.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
know
about
(inaudible)
kenny.
mr.
archibald
cox
kenny
i
believe
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
i
will.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
a
number
of
questions
which
we're
left
open
at
the
end
of
the
session
yesterday
that
i
would
like
to
try
to
deal
with
at
the
beginning
of
the
sessions
this
morning.
the
most
convenient
one
to
discuss
first
is
to
say
a
word
about
more
--
about
the
meaning
of
perfected
right
and
to
tell
the
court
what
i
have
been
able
to
find
about
the
usage
of
that
term.
to
acquire
or
to
avoid
begging
the
question,
i
will
call
a
complete
water
right.
it's
clear
under
the
law
of
all
the
western
states,
as
i
believe,
that
a
series
of
steps
are
required.
one
begins
perhaps
by
making
a
claim
and,
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
law
of
some
states,
this
may
be
done
by
making
a
--
posting
the
claim
near
the
stream
under
statutes
that
may
be
filed,
and
so
forth.
after
one
makes
claim,
he
then
begins
to
construct
the
works
for
diverting
the
water.
he
may
make
the
claim,
say,
and
begin
the
construction
of
works
in
1950.
then
he
goes
on,
goes
the
work.
he
may
have
completed
the
works
in
1955
and
begun
his
diversion
of
the
water,
let
us
say,
in
1957
and
applied
it
to
beneficial
use
later
in
the
year
1957.
now,
as
i
read
all
the
authorities,
he
does
not
have
a
complete
appropriation
or
complete
water
right
until
he
has
either
diverted
the
water
which
appears
to
be
the
law
in
california,
at
least
earlier,
or
has
actually
applied
it
to
beneficial
use
which
appears
to
be
the
law
in
most
of
the
other
states.
now,
it
is
at
that
stage
in
1957
that
his
right
is
complete.
it
is
also
true
that
when
he
completes
the
work
in
1957
and
applies
the
water
to
the
land,
or
under
some
of
the
california
decision
makes
the
diversion
that
it
gets
it
all
there
to
apply
to
the
land,
that
he
has
an
appropriative
right.
when
that
is
done,
it
relates
back
to
1950.
so
that,
he
would
come
ahead
of
someone
else
who
perhaps
had
completed
the
whole
business
in
1955
and
he
would
have
the
prior
right.
now,
the
usage
is
also
not
uncommon,
i
would
say
common,
to
speak
of
what's
done
in
1957,
the
series
of
steps
to
speak
of
what
he
then
has
as
a
perfected
right.
for
example,
hutchins
in
the
california
law
of
water
rights,
on
page
108
says,
“it
was
said
in
an
early
case
that
an
appropriation
consist
of
a
series
of
steps
which,
taken
together,
make
the
right
perfect.”
of
course,
this
is
our
usage
in
speaking
of
liens,
and
gifts,
and
other
things
but
the
final
step
is
what
perfects
it.
similarly,
in
killing
on
irrigation
in
the
water
rights,
in
the
second
volume,
the
first
sentence
of
section
728,
the
appropriation
becomes
perfect
only
when
the
dams,
ditches,
or

from

source
of
supply

actually
used
for
beneficial
purposes.

says,
“that
is
when
the
right
is
perfect.”
will
does
not
use,
so
far
as
i
can
discover,
the
term
“perfect”
at
any
stage.
we
weren't
able
to
find
it
last
evening
in
any
event,
but
he
does
lay
down,
he
summarizes,
the
rules
that
i've
just
stated
without
using
the
word
“perfect.”
in
section
398
of
the
third
--
this
is
--
i'm
reading
from
the
third
edition,
section
398.
now,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
398
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
other
related
sections
but
that's
the
recapitulation.
it's
interesting
to
note
that,
during
the
debate
on
the
project
act,
mr.
brat
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
still
on
it.
excuse
me,
sir,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
mr.
bratton,
in
the
debate
had
another
suggestion
with
respect
to
the
project
act.
so,
we
have
something
not
colored
by
any
of
these
claims.
he
was
proposing
that
people
who
had
perfected
rights
should
not
be
charged
by
the
--
for
--
by
the
secretary
for
the
impounded
water,
but
those
who
didn't
have
perfected
rights
who
are
getting
new
rights
after
the
project
was
completed
should
be
charged.
that's
of
no
importance
here
and
it
didn't
carry
but,
in
the
course
of
making
that
suggestion,
mr.
bratton
showed
how
he
understood
this
term
“perfected
right”
and
he
suggested
that
there
should
be
a
disti
--
the
distinction
i
mentioned
between
those
who
have
perfected
their
water
rights
by
the
actual
application
of
water
to
beneficial
use.
and
he
used
that
term
--
this
is
70
congressional
record
73,
and
he
uses
a
similar
expression
over
on
page
74.
mr.
archibald
cox
senator
bratton,
yes,
sir.
i
find
that
perfected
was
used
again
by
mr.
brandeis
in
283
united
states
in
arizona
against
california,
where
he
says
on
page
459,
“under
the
law
of
arizona,
the
perfected
vested
right
to
appropriate
water
within
the
state
cannot
be
acquired
without
the
performance
of
physical
acts
through
which
the
water
is
and
well
in
fact
be
diverted
to
beneficial
use
--
is
and
will
in
fact
be
diverted
to
beneficial
use”,
so
that,
he
spoke
of
perfected
as
something
that
happens
when
all
these
acts
have
been
done.
and,
just
one
last
reference
to
show
that
this
isn't
unique
by
any
means,
i
find
in
the
head
note,
through
rocky
deposer,
48
colorado
134,
describing
the
decree
in
an
earlier
case.
it
said
all
other
rights
were
left
inchoate
and
became
absolute
only
upon
application
of
the
water
the
beneficial
uses
within
a
reasonable
time,
and
whether
a
perfected
right
to
the
enjoinment
of
the
water
had
vested
was
left
to
be
determined
in
some
future
appropriate
proceeding,
in
other
words,
whether
it
had
been
appropriated
to
the
beneficial
use.
one
also
finds
senator
hayden
frequently
using
the
term
in
this
sense
in
the
debate
on
the
division
of
the
water
but
of
course
that's,
to
some
extent,
self-serving
and
i
think
the
more
significant
one
is
senator
bratton's
use
of
the
term
in
connection
with
something
quite
different,
where
he
wasn't
arguing
a
case
about
existing
rights
in
the
river.
now,
the
--
so,
i
take
it,
that
as
a
matter
of
usage,
that
perfected
right
is
one
which
you
have
because
you've
done
all
the
acts,
including
the
application
to
beneficial
use.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
was
addressing
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
seems
to
be
that
there,
in
a
sense
if
i
may
say
so,
begs
the
question.
congress
used
the
term
here,
“present
perfected
right”,
and
i
would
think
that
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
to
a
considerable
extent,
this
rights
had
been
built
under
state
law.
under
the
reclamation
act,
the
rights
were
defendant,
as
i
understand
it,
first,
on
contract
with
the
secretary.
they
might
later
then
take
on
many
characteristics
from
the
state
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
here,
the
relevance
of
the
discussion
of
perfected
right
was,
first,
this
is
the
base
of
so
much
of
the
argument
that
it's
important
we
have
the
terms
clear
but,
second,
the
term
we
are
of
course
directly
concerned
with
is
not
simply
perfected
right
but
present
perfected
right.
and,
the
question
that
would
finish
off
this
discussion,
in
my
judgment,
is
what
was
added
by
putting
present
in
front
of
perfected.
and
to
me,
it
suggests
that
the
congress
and
the
authors
of
the
colorado
river
compact
and
the
authors
of
these
various
proposals
that
led
up
to
the
project
act,
when
they
used
the
term,
all
met
rights
which
are
now
perfected.
the
rights
that
are
presently
perfected
rights,
in
other
words,
that
have
been
perfected,
not
rights
that
might
be
perfected
in
the
future
and
then,
by
the
process
to
the
state
law,
relate
back.
in
other
words,
it's
the
addition
of
the
adjective
“present”
that
the
master
thought,
and
which
we
think,
establish
this
cutoff
point
on
the
date
in
1929.
i
said
1928
yesterday.
i
should
have
said
1929
when
the
project
act
became
effective,
because
that's
about
the
only
meaning
present
perfected
right,
current
perfected
right
can,
in
my
judgment,
have.
now,
insofar
as
the
division
between
arizona
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
cali
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
recognize
that,
mr.
justice,
indeed.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
thought
most
to
them
were
not.
indeed,
that
it's
because
--
i
would
say
this,
that
there
are
unquestionably
many
aspects
of
the
rights
of
water
uses
deriving
who
get
water
under
contracts
with
the
secretary
on
reclamation
projects.
there
are
many
aspects
of
those
rights
which
are
governed
and
has
to
be
governed
by
state
law.
and,
the
traffic
that
you
speak
of,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
permitted
by
the
reclamation
act,
is
undoubtedly
governed
by
state
law
and
i
take
it,
it's
evolution
of
the
rights
that's
governed
by
the
state
law,
and
so
forth.
there
are,
we
think,
certain
other
rights
which
the
secretary
has,
at
least
for
many
years,
is
certain
which
are
governed
by
the
secretary's
contracts
under
the
reclamation
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
that's
why
i
was
just
going
on
to
say
that
we
have
no
specific
instances,
with
respect
to
which
it
is
necessary
to
draw
a
line
intrastate
which
were
--
to
resolve
a
conflict
between
users
intrastate
which
would
require
the
court
to
decide
whether
the
state
law
or
the
secretary's
practice
control
it.
and,
it's
for
that
reason
that
i
submit
that
those
references
to
this
issue
in
the
master's
report
intrastate
should
be
struck
out.
now,
so
far
as
the
rights
among
the
states
go,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
would
come
to
the
same
determination.
whether
present
perfected
right
is
to
be
determined
simply
by
interpreting
it
in
the
federal
statute
or
whether
one
was
to
look
at
law
of
someone
or
all
the
state,
he
would
still
find
that
the
california
claims,
which
had
been
staked
out
before
1929,
were
not
in
1929
present
perfective
rights
by
whatever
law
he
decided.
and
consequently,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
this
issue
needs
to
be
resolved
and
i
would
think
that
it
was
important
in
view
of
the
--
this
being
a
serious
issue
on
which
their
conflicting
opinion
not
to
undertake
the
result.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
the
nevada
contract
--
that
the
attack
on
the
nevada
contract
requires
any
resolution
of
that
issue.
in
one
sentence,
the
reason
of
our
difficulty
with
the
master's
ruling
on
that
point
is
that
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
enter
into
contracts
with
users.
and
we
say
that
the
state
of
nevada
is
not
a
user,
that
there
are
may
be
users
people,
who
are
going
to
use
water
within
nevada
but
there
is
no
right
to
the
water
until
the
secretary
has
entered
into
a
contract
with
users.
now,
there
would
be
an
issue,
in
theory,
as
to
whether
state
law
governs
with
whom
he
might
contract
if
we
have
those
specific
problems
of
that
kind
here
because
there
aren't
competing
bidders
for
the
contract
at
the
present
time.
so
i
think,
in
this
respect,
our
attack
on
the
nevada
contract
rest
on
the
language
of
the
federal
statue,
to
which
you
can
make
contracts
with
users.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
are
made
with
the
users.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
arizona
contract
is
clearly
a
contract
with
the
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
for
the
use
of
water
but
a
--
an
agreement
with
the
state
to
give
contracts
--
for
the
secretary
to
give
contracts
up
to
a
million
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
to
arizona
users.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
that
arizona
can't
make
the
argument
that
nevada
makes,
and
the
master
recognized
that
they
couldn't.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
going
on
to
the
power
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
may
be
some
little
variations,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
but
in
general.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
think
that
the
purpose
for
putting
the
word
--
mr.
archibald
cox
“present”
in
was
to
make
plain
present
perfected
rights.
it
means
those
already
perfected,
those
now
perfected.
and
therefore,
the
doctrine
of
relation-back
is
excluded
by
the
adjective
“present.”
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
have
been
able
to
find
that,
as
i've
been
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
have
never
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
does
make
the
law
hang
on
that
word
“present”
and
it
is
a
word
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
was
about
to
make
one
further
concession,
and
that
is
that
the
term,
neither
our
researches
nor,
i
think
i
can
say
from
conversations
with
counsel
last
evening,
anyone
else's
researches,
have
developed
any
lawyer's
art
meaning
that
--
in
which
the
term
“present
perfected
right”
has
been
used
elsewhere.
it's
apparently
been
used
in
the
colorado
river
compact
and
in
this
statute
and
in
the
discussions
of
this
statute.
and
i
am
told
that
that's
about
the
end
of
it.
we've
turned
up
with
no
use
of
it.
it's
not
even
the
standard
words.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
a
--
it's
--
it
is
a
very
--
it
is
almost
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
critical
point.
there's
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
present
perfected
right?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
confess
i'm
relying
on
a
very
short
conversation
largely
with
mr.
ely
in
his
assumptions,
but
they
tell
me
that
they
haven't
been
able
to
find
any
technical
usage
of
present
perfected
right.
i
think
the
common
sense
of
it
here,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
does
go
to
establish
the
notion
that
there
was
to
be
a
cutoff
point,
but
it
does
rest
on
that
word.
now,
remember
the
first
place
it
comes
into
our
story
was
in
the
colorado
river
compact
and
the
upper
basin
was
willing
to
recognize
some
claims
of
the
lower
basin.
but,
remember
that
it
was
--
the
whole
purpose
of
the
compact
was
to
see
that
the
lower
basin,
which
would
develop
fast,
wouldn't
get
in
ahead
of
it.
and,
they
said
present
perfected
rights,
this
is
in
the
compact,
shall
be
recognized.
well
now,
i
take
it,
if
--
what
reads
this
together
with
the
notion
of
getting
away
from
these
rights
to
appropriate
that
it
says,
in
effect,
what's
vested
and
what's
complete.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
--
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
makes
two
suggestions.
one
is
that,
in
support
of
justice
whittaker's
suggestion,
the
word
“present”,
if
the
etymology
is
of
significance,
it
may
not
be
conclusive
but
it
certainly
is
significant.
i
added
--
it
has
been
added
in
a
--
for
the
apparent
purpose
of
putting
some
limit
on
what
otherwise
would
be
the
meaning
of
“perfect.”
now,
the
second
thing
that
i
suggest
to
you
is
that
to
speak
and
say,
well,
once
the
final
acts
are
done,
there
is
a
present
perfected
right
in
the
usage
of
the
people
in
the
west,
in
the
states
affected
is,
i
suggest,
to
look
at
the
situation
as
of
the
time
when
everything
has
been
done.
but,
the
statute
looks
at
it
as
of
the
time
when
it
was
enacted
and,
it's
the
--
it's
the
words,
it's
the
instructions
given
by
a
man
speaking
as
of
1929
that
we're
it
concerned
with.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
act
--
we'll
agree
with
the
first
part
of
that
statement.
unfortunately,
we
have
no
alternative
either
of
this
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
enter
it
as
best
as
we
can.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
--
i
think
this
is
one
that
cannot
escape.
the
only
--
may
i
say
one
last
word
on
this
point
then
i
think
i
ought
to
go
on.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
understood
that
i
said
to
you
that
there
was
necessary
--
no
necessity
of
the
deciding
any
issue
as
to
what
law
governed
the
rights
of
competing
users
within
a
single
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
intrastate.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
one
has
to
decide
the
meaning
of
present
perfected
rights
in
order
to
resolve
the
controversy
between
arizona
and
california.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
that's
what
i
was
directing
myself
to
in
answer
to
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
--
that
is
true
--
would
be
true,
except
for
the
bearings
which
present
perfected
right
has
on
the
question,
whether
congress
intended
a
pro
rata
reduction
of
the
share
of
each
in
the
case
of
shortage.
let
me
--
let
me
postpone,
if
i
may,
the
discussion
of
the
power
provisions
and
go
along
as
deposer
here,
then,
i
think
that
that
will
supply
a
clearer
answer
to
your
honor's
question
and
if
i
try
to
give
it
in
a
single
sentence.
our
theory
of
statute,
as
i've
said
many
times,
is
that
it
contemplates
a
federal
interstate
apportion.
that
it
lays
down
the
general
guidelines
and
gives
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
power
to
flush
out
skeletons
and
to
determine,
out
of
the
water
that
california
doesn't
get,
exactly
how
much
nevada
will
get
and
exactly
how
much
arizona
will
get.
the
statute
gives
guides.
nature
virtually
made
that
division,
but
the
secretary
had
power,
in
our
view,
to
finish
it
out
by
contract
and
he
did
in
the
early
1940's,
give
arizona
2.8
billion
acre-feet,
and
nevada
by
0.3
billion
acre-feet,
and
he
gave
arizona
one-half
of
the
surplus.
i
point
out
in
passing
that
his
act
can
be
squared
only
with
our
reading
of
section
4
(a).
that,
although
the
contract
say
it's
arizona's
legal
right,
it's
perfectly
plain
that
the
secretary
acted
on
the
view
that
the
mainstream
was
being
apportioned
4.4,
2.8,
and
0.3.
and,
we
say
that
those
contracts,
as
the
master
said,
constitute
an
allocation
of
those
amounts
among
the
states
provided
that
there
is
7.5
million
acre-feet
of
mainstream
water.
then,
the
question
arises.
well,
suppose
there
isn't
7.5
million
acres-feet
of
mainstream
water.
what
do
we
do
then?
and,
we
come
to
what
mr.
ely
stressed
as
the
priority
branch
of
his
case.
there
would
seem
to
be
a
prior
right,
three
possible
answers
to
that
question.
one,
that
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
governs,
and
of
course
that's
california's
claim.
two,
that
the
secretary
has
power
to
make
the
allocation.
the
secretary
hasn't
provided
for
this.
so,
until
he
does
something
and
does
say
who
shall
be
the
users
in
this
event,
the
matter
simply
stands
unresolved.
nobody
is
arguing
for
that
position
but
it
certainly
is
one
of
the
possible
readings.
the
third
possibility,
the
one
which
the
master
followed
and
the
one
which
we
think
is
correct,
is
to
say
that
there
should
be
a
ratable
deduction
--
a
ratable
reduction
on
each
of
the
states
subject,
as
you
point
out
justice
whittaker,
to
the
qualification
that
present
perfected
rights,
as
i've
defined,
must
first
be
protected.
the
master
recommended
the
ratable
deduction,
and
we
think
it's
proper,
because
it
is
the
most
consistent,
as
we
see
it,
with
what
we
know
about
policies
and
aims
of
the
compact
and
the
project
act
and
in
deriving
insight
into
the
aims
and
policies
of
the
compact
and
the
project
act.
with
the
respect
to
this
matter,
to
which
nobody
addressed
himself
explicitly,
the
master
laid
and
we
laid
a
great
deal
of
stress
on
the
term
“present
perfected
right”
because
we
think
that,
in
both
instances,
it
shows
an
intension
to
establish
a
cutoff
point
as
of
the
date
on
which
those
documents
speak
and
to
start
over
again
with
the
new
federal
allocation
as
of
that
time.
one
of
the
reasons
we're
doing
that
or,
being
that
the
claim
is
to
the
river
which
had
not
been
perfected
previously
were
--
disputed
many
of
them,
unknown.
some
of
them,
like
that
of
metropolitan
los
angeles,
couldn't
really
mean
anything
until
the
boulder
dam
was
built
--
the
hoover
dam
was
built,
and
the
water
was
brought
under
control
by
the
federal
government.
and
this
is
the
sense
in
which
the
term
seems
to
be
used
in
the
legislative
history.
a
second
reason
for
concluding
that
there
was
to
a
ratable
deduction
is
that
there
is
every
indication
that
also
the
shares
of
the
states
differed
in
size.
they
were
thought
to
be
of
equal
dignity
and
that,
therefore,
there
should
be
equality
of
right.
this
would
seem
to
imply
in
the
event
that
there
wasn't
the
7.5
million
acre-feet
to
go
around.
now,
the
master
stressed
that
instruction,
first,
to
protect
present
perfected
rights
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
he
said
there's
no
reason
to
put
this
in
the
statute
if
priority
of
appropriation
is
to
be
controlling
in
the
event
of
shortages
because
that
would
supply
with
a
system
for
protecting
not
only
perfected
rights
but
imperfect
rights,
speaking
as
of
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted.
second,
in
some
instances
giving
protection
--
prior
protection
to
present
perfected
rights
is
inconsistent
with
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
because
you
might
have
a
case
where
a
man
started
his
appropriation
in
1950.
he
worked
on
it
and
he
perfected
it
in
1960,
but
somebody
else
came
on
and
started
in
1955
and
finished
in
1957.
now,
under
the
present
perfected
rights
as
the
master
points
out,
the
intermediate
fellow
would
be
protected
if
the
statute
were
enacted
in
1958
instead
of
1928,
whereas,
under
the
law
of
prior
appropriation,
it
would
come
out
the
other
way.
one
of
the
other
important
factors,
it
seems
to
us,
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
a
ratable
reduction,
is
that
it
has
been
the
practice
of
the
secretary
of
interior
in
entering
into
contracts
under
the
reclamation
act
to
provide
that
if
there
is
a
shortage,
the
available
water
shall
be
shared
ratably.
and
it's
partly
to
protect
those
contracts
in
that
practice
that
i
had
the
difference
apparently
with
mr.
justice
douglas
and
urge
the
court
not
to
embark
in
this
and
discussing
this
point
in
its
opinion
in
the
case.
but
to
delete
those
parts
of
the
mater's
report.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
said
that
it
had
been,
under
the
reclamation
act,
the
practice
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
many
instances
to
set
up,
in
contrast
with
state
law,
a
provision
for
ratable
reduction
in
the
event
that
there
wasn't
enough
water
among
users
on
the
project
to
go
around,
and
it's
the
master's
statement
that
state
law
controls
intrastate.
it
seemed
to
me
this
throws
some
doubt
upon
that
practice
since
we
have
no
conflict
here
between
two
users
in
the
same
state.
i
was
urging
the
court
to
disapprove
those
parts
of
the
master's
report.
i
understood
justice
douglas
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
discussion,
expressing
the
view
the
master
had
expressed.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it
ever
arises.
it's
--
we
don't
know
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
just
think
you
could
say
that
you
neither
approved
nor
disapproved
the
pass
of
judgment
on
it.
i
don't
care
about
the
form
of
word.
the
--
part
of
the
decree
should
simply
be
that
is
involved
should
simply
be
deleted
and
nothing
put
in
its
place.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
there's
any
need
to
keep
the
litigation
open
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
for
this
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
stated
--
no,
no,
not
at
all.
i
mean
it
should
be
left
for
a
separate
lawsuit
in
which
the
parties
interested
would
bring
in
the
lower
courts.
i
think
you
should
simply
say
it's
not
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
we
think
that
the
master's
retention
of
jurisdiction
to
determine
more
specifically
who
are
the
holders
of
present
perfected
rights
and
in
what
amount,
for
example,
is
profit
and
that
that
should
not
be
left
to
future
lawsuits
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
because
that
is
an
important
thing
to
clarify.
i
would
deny
to
the
development
of
this
area.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
--
mr.
archibald
cox
he
contemplated
that
these
states
would
speak
for
the
parties
in
that
respect.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
sets
forth
the
precise
time
schedule
in
the
decree,
page
359
and
item
6.
i
hesitate
to
take
the
time
to
read
it
now,
but
he
sets
forth
the
manner
in
which
he
contemplates
that
present
perfected
rights
will
be
more
particularly
identified
and
adjudicated.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
hope
in
the
next
six
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
the
next
six
minutes,
i've
got
to
deal
with
the
power
problem
and
the
indians.
mr.
archibald
cox
with
the
respect
to
the
power
problem,
i
think
the
most
convenient
way
to
state
it
is
this.
that
in
the
congressional
consideration
of
the
project
act,
there
were
apparently
three
issues
relating
to
power.
one
was
whether
the
federal
government
should
get
into
the
power
of
business,
as
it
was
put,
and
there
was
considerable
difference
of
opinion
about
that.
some
put
it
on
grounds
of
policy,
some
on
constitutional
grounds.
that
was
resolved
by
clearly
giving
the
secretary
authority
either
to
construct
and
operate
a
power
plant
who
can
sell
the
electricity,
or
to
lease
the
water
rights
necessary
to
generate
power.
he
was
given
a
choice.
the
second
issue
before
the
senate
at
least,
and
i
think
before
the
whole
congress
on
this
question,
was
how
shall
the
power
produced
be
divided
among
the
states?
there
was
apparently
an
informal
agreement
about
that
at
that
this
famous
governors'
conference.
in
any
event,
the
problem
of
making
the
allocation
was
given
to
the
secretary.
in
accordance
with
rules
or
regulations
that
he
might
promulgate,
and
he
did
promulgate
regulations
which
make
a
division
among
the
several
states.
that
is
in
our
ex
--
the
government's
exhibit
--
government's
exhibit
51.
it
is
also
a
public
document,
boulder
canyon
project
final
reports
part
one,
and
i
am
looking
most
particularly
at
page
1131
which
shows
the
allocation
of
energy
among
the
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
washington
d.c.,
1950.
it's
a
government
printing
office.
mr.
archibald
cox
boulder
canyon
project
final
reports.
the
third
issue,
which
was
before
the
congress
during
the
debates,
had
to
do
with
the
--
compensating
the
states
for
what
they
conceive
would
be
the
loss
of
tax
income
or
tax
revenues
if
the
federal
government
built
a
power
project
where
a
private
utility
might
have
put
it
because
the
private
utility
would
be
subjected
to
tax.
and
i
judge
that
this
related
to
some
of
the
developments
which
later
came
in
under
the
tennessee
valley
authority
because
there
was
a
feeling
that
these
state
should
lose
the
revenue.
those
who
had
that
feeling
turned
out
to
be
the
minority
but
in
this
act
they
were
partly
compensated
because
there
is
a
provision
in
the
project
act
calling
for
paying
specified
percentages
of
any
income
in
excess
of
what
was
necessary
to
finance
the
project
to
the
states
of
arizona
and
nevada.
now,
each
one
gets
it's
in
--
on
page
384,
each
gets
18-and-three
quarters
percent
of
the
excess
revenue,
page
384.
now,
in
one
sentence,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
draw
the
two
conclusions
from
the
provisions
of
the
statute
dealing
with
power.
one
is
that
a
com
--
that
a
detailed
federal
plan
for
the
allocation
of
power
and
the
choosing
of
who
would
get
the
contracts
for
either
the
operation
of
this
power
plant
or
the
distribution
of
the
energy
and
the
decision
as
to
where
it
would
go
was
all
left
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
without
the
regard
to
state
law,
and
he
was
to
explicitly
--
is
given
authority
to
resi
--
to
decide
between
conflicting
appellees.
that
authority
is
given
in
section
5
in
the
very
same
section
and
in
the
very
same
sentences
indeed
that
gives
the
authority
to
let
contracts
for
water,
and
we
think
that
this
supports
the
view
that
a
federal
allocation
was
contemplated
because
it
is
clear
in
one
case
and
the
other
allocation
is
made
pursuant
to
a
similar
power
given
in
the
same
sentences
and
we
think
that
--
therefore
implies
that
the
two
were
to
be
parallel.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
position
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
position
was
argued
although
not
on
the
debates
i
read
last
night
very
strongly.
it
may
have
been
argued
by
the
power
companies
outside
of
the
halls
of
congress.
it
was
pressed
by
senator
ashurst
on
the
constitutional
ground
you
suggest,
and
senator
hayden
said,
“well,
i
think
congress
has
the
power
but
they
shouldn't
exercise
it.”
and,
your
honor
may
recall
it
was
an
effort
to
amend
the
act
by
saying
that,
“well,
if
a
power
company
will
give
a
satisfactory
contract,
then
the
secretary
must
give
it
to
the
power
company”,
but
that
attempt
was
debated
--
was
defeated
and
the
secretary
was
left
with
the
full
power
to
choose.
he
ended
contracting
with
the
city
of
los
angeles
in
southern
california
edison
to
operate
the
power
plant.
now,
the
other
--
i'll
have
to
leave
to
my
brief,
i'm
afraid,
the
question
of
validity
of
those
clauses
at
the
arizona
and
nevada
contracts
which
provide
that
the
share
of
those
dates
of
the
impounded
water
shall
be
reduced
in
the
amount
of
any
water
that
they
take
up
ups
--
take
out
upstream.
the
master
ruled
against
us
on
this.
we
think
--
i
could
put
it
in
two
sentences
that
the
master
was
wrong
because
the
basic
assumption
on
which
the
project
act
was
enacted
was
that
7.5
million
acre-feet
would
go
down
into
lake
mead.
and
we
think
it
was
within
the
implied
power
of
the
secretary
in
contracting
to
say
that
if
you,
arizona
or
you,
nevada,
prevent
the
supply
then
--
from
developing,
then
i'm
going
to
reduce
what
i
give
you
in
the
amount
that
you
have
shorted
the
supply,
if
i
could
be
very
colloquial.
that's
the
gist
of
our
argument.
we
think
this
is
an
incidental
power
to
make
good
the
assumption
on
which
the
project
act
was
based,
and
we
think
that
the
master's
arguments
somehow
are
predicated
on
the
assumption
the
secretary
was
giving
a
license
to
state
users
to
take
water
out
up
above.
we
don't
think
he
was
doing
anything
like
that.
he
was
leaving
that
to
whatever
law
governs
it
saying,
“if
you
take
it
out,
then
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
as
much
as
i
otherwise
would.”
now,
the
other
exceptions
that
the
united
states
filed,
i
will
also
have
to
leave
to
the
brief.
i
would
like
to
spend
about
five
minutes
on
this
matter,
the
indian
reservation.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
afraid
i
would
have
to
ask
to
leave
this
matter
in
a
statement
in
answer
to
that.
we'd
be
glad
to
do
it
but
i
don't
have
that
knowledge.
with
respect
to
the
indians
and
the
other
federal
reservations,
we
think
the
master
was
quite
right
in
holding
that
the
claim
of
the
united
states
to
water
appurtenant
to
the
indian
reservations
and
certain
other
federal
establishments,
which
was
reserved
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
project
act,
is
a
prior
perfected
right
and
is
therefore,
to
be
protected
within
the
allocation
to
each
state.
originally
the
united
states
argued
that
its
claim
should
come
off
the
top,
but
the
master
ruled
against
us
on
that
and
we
have
not
accepted
that
part
of
the
decision.
we
do
think
he
was
right
in
saying
that
each
indian
reservation
and
other
federal
establishment
on
the
mainstream
is
entitled
to
the
amount
of
water
which
he
finds
necessary
to
carry
out
its
purposes.
now,
in
terms
of
the
indian
reservations
we
are
talking
in
points
of
fact
about
the
quarrel.
the
cocopah
reservation
down
here,
yuma
indian
reservation,
the
big
one
is
the
colorado
indian
reservation
with
much
or
most
of
the
point,
and
i
shall
add
the
chemehuevi
reservation,
fort
mohave
reservation
above.
our
theory
is
very
simple.
we
claim
the
title
to
the
userfrot,
that
is
the
right
to
use
this
water
on
the
appurtenant
land
in
this
manner.
we
say
it
passed
to
the
unites
states
as
part
of
the
public
domain
under
the
treaty
with
mexico,
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
with
mexico.
that
when
these
reservations
were
set
up,
we
impliedly
reserved
under
the
winters
doctrine
the
water
necessary
to
carry
up
the
purposes
of
the
reservation
to
make
them
a
useful
agricultural,
farming,
and
gracing
community
for
such
indians
as
might
be
settled
on
it,
that
having
reserved
those
rights,
nothing
took
them
out
of
it
and
the
title
is
still
in
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
this
use
would
not
defeat
a
claim
of
the
federal
government
of
water
or
defeat
any
other
federal
titles.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
use
has
never
been
at
the
full
scale.
there
has
been
no
irrigation
of
the
mohave.
the
colorado
river
has
been
irrigated.
we
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
use
of
these
reser
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
use
of
these
reservations
changes
from
time
to
time.
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
with
respect
to
the
indians
changes
from
time
to
time.
i
suggest
that
the
failure
to
appropriate
more
money
in
a
particular
year
or
even
series
of
years
should
not
imply
a
permanent
abandonment
by
the
government
of
its
right
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there
has
been
--
there
has
been
no
doubt.
there
has
been
part
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
on
the
big
reservation,
it
is
nothing
like
that
one.
it
applies
to
this
unique
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
situation
of
the
mohave.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
measure
of
the
right,
we
think
the
master
was
correct
in
saying
that
the
measure
is
the
amount
of
water
required
to
make
the
to
--
is
required
to
properly
irrigate
the
irrigable
lands.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
land
as
such.
that
this
is
the
only
meaningful
measure
of
what
purposes
of
the
reservation,
and
that's
what
the
implied
reservation
is
for
are
because
indians
--
more
indians
maybe
settled
there.
the
original
purpose
was
not
simply
for
a
particular
tribe
of
indians
at
the
colorado
river
reservation.
it
was
to
settle
indians
of
this
general
region.
there
had
been
talk
about
settling
some
of
the
navahos
over
there.
the
policy
in
this
matter
changes
from
time
to
time
and
the
number
of
indians
may
grow
from
time
to
time.
furthermore,
i
suggest
that
the
fact
that
an
indian
moves
off
the
reservation
or
just
as
somebody
moves
off
reclaimed
land
should
not
indicate
that
he
or
his
tribe
has
been
deprived
of
the
use
of
that
land
just
because
he
doesn't
live
on
it.
he
and
his
tribe,
without
attempting
now
to
divide
between
them
or
to
be
too
precisely,
would
seem
to
be
entitled
to
the
practical
use
to
them
in
form
of
income
or
state,
or
call
it
what
you
will,
of
that
land
that
has
been
set
apart
for
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
is,
yes.
i'm
afraid
my
time
has
expired.
i'll
simply
have
to
submit
the
details
of
the
argument
about
indians
on
our
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
say
a
word
about
question
of
justiciability
that
occupied
a
considerable
part
of
the
court's
time
yesterday.
first,
the
--
it
is
clear
that
there
is
enough
water
in
the
river
to
satisfy
the
presently
existing
uses.
but
it
is
also
claimed
that
there
is
not
enough
water
in
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river
to
satisfy
the
fully
matured
claims
based
upon
past
events.
the
exact
amount
which
will
be
available
below
lee
ferry
is
of
course
unknown
and
as
the
master
found
unknowable
with
any
exactitude
in
the
future,
so
that
one
is
dealing
here
with
something
of
indefinite
and
perhaps
shifting
size.
but
there
are
certainly
no
estimates
that
put
the
exact
amount
available
after
evaporation
and
channel
losses
and
after
satisfying
the
mexican
treaty
in
excess
of
8
million
acre-feet.
now,
take
the
matured
claims
that
already
exist
or
at
least
are
alleged
to
exist.
california
claims
that
she
is
entitled
to
5,378,000
acre-feet
based
upon
what
she
says
are
existing
appropriative
rights.
arizona
claims
based
on
a
contract
with
the
secretary
of
interior,
2.8
million,
and
nevada
claims
300,000.
adding
the
total
of
those
claims,
one
gets
just
under
8,500,000
acre-feet
which
is
in
excess
of
what
anyone
would
say
was
a
reliable
amount
downstream
in
the
future.
there's
another
way
of
indicating
the
extent
of
the
clash.
i
made
myself
a
little
table
which
shows
how
the
conflicting
theories
of
the
master
in
california
would
work
out
at
two
estimates
of
the
available
flow.
if
you
take
the
--
if
the
available
flow
is
5,850,000
as
suggested
by
--
as
suggested
by
the
california
witnesses,
i
have
had
these
copy
then
if
it
would
help
the
court
why
the
clerk
contest
if
you
wouldn't
have
write
it
down.
i
think
it's
accurate.
it
certainly
gives
the
main
outlines
of
maybe
some
differences
about
the
details.
if
the
available
flow
is
5,850,000
then
under
the
california
proposal,
california
would
get
4.6
million,
nevada
would
get
125,500
and
arizona
would
get
1,129,500.
under
the
master's
report
california
would
get
only
3.4
million
against
the
4.6
million,
arizona
would
get
234,000
and
arizona
would
get
something
over
2
million
so
there
is
a
very
significant
difference
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
available
after
deducting
the
mexican
treaty
in
channel
losses
and
so
forth.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
does
not
include
the
gila
river.
i'm
talking
about
the
mainstream,
yes.
now,
if
you
assumed
that
the
available
--
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
this
is
what
california
would
propose
to
decree
out
of
the
mainstream.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
well,
this
was
in
--
since
the
fight
is
over
the
mainstream
and
the
question
of
justiciability
relates
to
claims
on
the
mainstream,
this
seemed
to
me
to
show
the
conflict
between
the
claims
that
exist
today.
mr.
archibald
cox
there's
no
doubt
but
that
--
whatever
is
in
the
gila
will
go
to
arizona.
there's
a
question
as
to
how
the
gila
should
be
--
there's
a
question
as
to
what
is
the
surplus
over
the
4.4
million,
and
what
the
4.4
million
should
be
taken
out
of
it.
but
i
don't
think
that
california
wants
to
use
any
gila
river
water.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
in
the
computation.
but
even
since
the
gila,
the
claims
would
still
be
--
have
the
same
conflict
as
i
suggest
here,
because
these
are
only
clients
to
the
mainstream
if
i
were
to
base
this
table
on
all
the
water
in
the
basin
then
i
would
have
had
to
put
in
more
claims
to
the
gila
than
there
are
gila
river
water.
and
so
again,
we
would
have
the
clear
conflict
between
claims
based
on
events
that
have
already
occurred.
now,
on
the
other
table,
i
will
show
you
the
difference
in
the
allocation
of
the
mainstream
under
the
master's
report
and
california's
proposal.
and
there
again,
there
is
an
obvious
conflict
between
the
rights
that
california
says
she
has
today
based
on
past
events
and
the
rights
which
arizona
and
nevada
say
they
have
today,
based
on
past
contracts
with
the
secretary.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
it
is
based
on
--
this
is
an
allocation
of
the
mainstream
but
the
computation
is
based
on
a
universe
that
would
include
the
gila.
now,
coming
to
the
law,
this
court
in
nebraska
against
wyoming
said,
referring
to
its
early
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
did
not
mean
to
concede
it.
i
thought
there
was
not
enough
water
to
go
around.
and
i
am
basing
my
argument
presently
on
that
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
people
to
some
extent
are
trying
to
carry
water
on
both
shoulders.
i
think
that
the
problem
there
is
this,
that
there
may
be
not
enough
water
for
purposes
of
having
a
justiciable
controversy
and
there
still
maybe
enough
prospects
of
future
water
so
that
we
do
not
have
to
think
of
all
the
southern
californians
as
saying
their
farmland
shrivel
up
or
the
people
of
the
metropolitan
district
goes
thirsty,
because
there
are
in
the
future
various
contingencies
that
may
fall
in.
including
as
arizona
says
the
possibility
is
unsafe.
but
i
think
there
is
an
in
between
point
where
there
is
a
disaster
for
southern
california
and
yet
there
is
a
real
conflict
as
to
the
existing
claims.
and
that's
the
position
which
we
would
think
was
an
accurate
description.
in
the
nebraska
against
wyoming
case,
this
court
said,
“wyoming
against
colorado
indicates
that
where
the
claims
to
the
water
the
river
exceed
the
supply,
a
controversy
exists
appropriate
for
judicial
determination.
and
then
referring
in
another
passage
to
that
earlier
case,
there
--
there
the
only
showing
of
injury
or
threat
of
injury
was
the
inadequacy
of
the
supply
of
water
to
meet
all
appropriative
rights.
but
now
here,
they
aren't
all
based
on
appropriative
rights,
arizona
is
based
on
the
contract.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
same
principle
applies
that
the
claims
based
on
past
amendment
exceed
the
supply.
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
two
other
things.
in
the
first
place,
a
suit
to
quiet
title
will
of
course
lie
in
the
case
of
water
rights
as
well
as
in
the
case
of
other
real
estate
and
this
may
be
thought
of
as
having
some
of
the
aspects
of
a
suit
to
quiet
title.
the
--
if
the
court's
concerned
with
that,
i
can
give
two
references
one
is
to
kinney
on
his
book
on
water,
second
edition,
section
1535;
the
other
is
to
wylie,
the
third
edition,
section
654
and
an
illustration
which
i
think
is
clear
occurred
to
me.
suppose
one
had
real
estate
to
which
there
were
mortgages
with
the
same
amounts
as
this
water.
and
you
were
trying
to
borrow
some
money,
claiming
that
the
amounts
of
the
alleged
liens
weren't
as
large
as
the
claimant
say
they
are.
as
i
understand
it,
under
those
circumstances,
he
could
maintain
a
bill
to
quiet
his
title.
finally,
i
would
remind
the
court
of
its
decision
in
illinois
against
wisconsin,
when
the
two
little
illinois
towns
filed
an
application
for
--
to
determine
their
right
to
withdraw
water
from
lake
michigan,
saying
that
the
lake
estates
denied
that
right.
the
bill
alleged
that
the
towns
couldn't
borrow
the
money
to
build
the
plants
to
draw
the
water
until
these
claims
were
adjudicated.
the
point
was
argued
in
full
and
while
the
court
wrote
no
opinion
and
i
suppose
it's
not
definitely
decided,
nevertheless
did
grant
permission
to
file
the
bill
between
the
states
so
that
again
points
in
this
same
direction.
i
would
emphasize,
finally
the
importance
of
the
clarification
here,
in
two
respects:
first,
this
controversy
clouds
the
title
and
blocks
the
development
of
the
river;
second,
from
the
standpoint
of
arizona
and
who
would
agree
from
our
standpoint
with
respect
to
the
indian
reservation,
california
keeps
changing
the
situation
all
the
time.
they
keep
taking
more
water
and
then
they
come
in
and
say,
“see,
we
are
entitled
to
this
because
we
have
been
using
it”.
and
this
in
itself
seems
to
me
a
changing
in
the
situation
and
affecting
of
the
arizona
and
indian
rights,
which
makes
the
case
sharply
justiciable.
now,
on
the
merits
from
the
standpoint
of
the
united
states,
this
case
has
two
main
parts,
the
apportionment
of
the
mainstream
water
between
arizona,
california
and
nevada,
and
the
second,
the
claims
of
the
united
states
to
water
in
behalf
of
the
indian
reservations
the
national
forest
park
and
the
wildlife
refuge.
the
mainstream
controversy
which
i
will
discuss
first
itself
has
two
principal
divisions:
first,
the
so-called
limitation
issue;
and
second,
the
so-called
priority
or
ratability
issue.
the
former
question,
i
think
might
better
be
stated
a
little
more
broadly
by
saying
that
it
raises
the
issue,
what's
the
subject
matter
to
be
divided?
what
is
the
supply
of
water
with
which
the
project
act
is
primarily
concerned?
is
it
all
the
water
in
the
lower
basin
as
california
contends?
or
is
it
--
does
the
project
act
deal
primarily
within
section
4
(a)
only
with
the
mainstream
water
controlled
by
the
hoover
dam
and
related
works.
once
that
question
has
been
answered
then
one
can
go
on
to
the
priority
or
ratability
issue.
now,
the
controversy
--
limitation
controversy
focuses
of
course
on
section
4
(a)
of
the
project
act
and
on
the
first
paragraph
of
section
4
(a).
if
the
court
wish
to
refer
to
it,
it
appears
on
page
382
of
the
master's
report,
which
provides
that
california
must
accept
a
limitation
that
all
the
water
she
takes
shall
not
exceed
4.4
million
acre-feet
of
waters,
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
states
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact
plus
not
more
than
one-half
of
any
excess
or
surplus
waters
unapportioned
by
said
compact.
the
dispute
is
over
the
composition
of
the
universe
that
section
4
(a)
divides
at
least,
divides
in
the
sense
that
it
says
california
can
have
only
so
much.
california
says
that
she
is
entitled
to
remember
the
4.4
million
out
of
the
7.5
million
acre-feet
of
all
the
water
in
the
entire
lower
basin
plus
the
gila.
thus,
she
is
willing
to
read
the
compact
literally.
because
the
compact
on
page
373,
rather
clearly
apportions
all
the
water
in
the
basin
but
she
is
unwilling
to
read
literally
the
words
plus
not
more
than
one
half
of
any
excess
or
surplus
waters
unapportioned
by
said
compact.
because
the
compact
says
that
the
waters
not
apportioned
by
article
iii
(a)
and
(b)
shall
be
held
for
future
apportionment.
and
california
has
to
give
the
words
not
apportioned
here
a
different
meaning
than
the
words
unapportioned
have
in
the
latter
part
of
the
compact
itself.
the
master
agrees
as
indeed
as
everyone
that
these
words
4.4
million
acre-feet
of
water
is
apportioned
to
lower
basin
states
by
paragraph
4
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
rivers
compact
are
to
be
read
as
referring
to
the
compact.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
but
he
said
that
the
draftsman
of
the
project
act,
acted
on
the
supposition
that
article
iii
(a)
of
the
compact,
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin,
7.5
million
acre-feet
of
mainstream
water.
the
congress
was
wrong,
the
master
said,
in
that
supposition
that
the
compact
apportion
is
to
7.5
million
acre-feet
out
of
all
the
water
in
the
basin.
but
it's
perfectly
clear,
right
or
wrong
that
congress
made
that
supposition.
and
then
he
said
the
question
is
--
shall
my
or
the
court's
interpretation
of
the
project
act
be
governed
by
the
true
meaning
of
the
compact
or
shall
it
be
governed
by
what
congress
clearly
suppose
was
the
meaning
of
the
compact
and
he
concluded
that
the
latter
meaning
of
the
project
act
was
the
one
that
should
be
followed
in
order
to
give
effect
to
the
intent
of
congress.
we
differed
from
the
master
only
in
one
minor
respect.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
unnecessary
and
indeed
inappropriate
to
construe
the
compact
at
all.
the
upper
basin
states
are
here,
arizona
would
put
a
different
meaning
on
the
compact
than
the
master
did.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
question
doesn't
need
to
be
decided
because
we
think
that
the
proper
way
to
interpret
section
4
(a)
is
to
give
article
iii
(a)
of
the
compact,
the
meaning
that
congress
suppose
it
have
and
that
that
controls
in
the
interpretation
of
the
project
act.
there
are
three
principal
grounds
for
this
conclusion.
one
is
that
congress
was
dealing
what
it
enacted
to
project
act
primarily
with
mainstream
waters
and
one
would
naturally
suppose
also
not
inevitably
that
the
limitations
would
be
written
in
terms
of
the
mainstream
waters
with
which
the
project
was
dealing.
second,
we
find
in
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
in
support
for
the
master's
reading
and
our
reading
that
congress
intended
to
apportion
7.5
million
acre-feet
of
mainstream
water.
there
are
several
provisions
in
the
second
paragraph,
382
and
over
on
383
that
seem
to
indicate
this
to
us.
the
master
mentioned
most
of
them.
in
the
first
place,
item
one,
authorizes
an
agreement
which
would
apportion
to
nevada
300,000
acre-feet
and
to
arizona,
2.8
million
acre-feet
of
the
7.5
million
acre-feet
annually
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
now
that,
if
you
couple
those
references
of
two
million
eight
point
three
million
with
the
4.4
million
given
to
california,
you
would
get
the
whole
7.5
million
acre-feet.
if
that
is
the
whole
7.5
million
acre-feet
apportioned
into
the
lower
basin,
then
one
cuts
out
two
lower
basin
states
in
the
--
supposes
the
congress
wasn't
concerned
with
them
at
all.
again,
item
two,
provides
that
arizona
may
annually
use
half
the
surplus
of
excess
and
half
of
the
excess
or
surplus
waters
unapportioned
by
the
colorado
river
compact.
the
compact
itself,
reserves
the
surplus
over
the
7.5
million
feet
of
basin
water,
for
future
apportionment
and
congress
can
hardly
be
suppose
to
have
said,
“well,
arizona
can
have
half
of
that.”
especially
when
they
said
in
the
first
paragraph
of
section
4
(a),
california
can
have
half
of
it
too
because
they
would
have
been
taking
the
whole
surplus.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
i
think
not.
it
speaks
of
the
surplus
unapportioned.
california
says,
that
means
the
first
million
of
which
was
allocated
to
the
lower
basin,
but
the
only
time
the
contract
speak
--
the
compact
speaks
of
waters
unapportioned
is
in
page
374
in
item
3f.
the
word
speaks
of
the
beneficial
equita
--
further
equitable
apportionment
of
the
beneficial
use
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
system
unapportioned
by
paragraphs
(a),
(b)
and
(c).
so
there,
it
speaks
as
if
(a),
(b)
and
perhaps
(c)
had
made
some
kind
of
an
apportionment.
finally,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
i
think
most
persuasive
of
all,
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
in
item
three
says
and,
and
this
is
certainly
an
additive
and,
and
that
the
state
of
arizona
shall
have
the
exclusive
beneficial
conceptive
use
of
the
gila
river
and
it's
territories
within
the
boundaries
of
said
state.
this
is
in
addition
to
what
have
gone
before
or
what
have
gone
before
then
must
have
been
an
apportionment
of
the
mainstream
water.
it
is
suggested
by
california
that
that's
an
inappropriate
reading
that
this
really
aren't
conjunctive
and
that
all,
that
there
were
some
duplication
in
this
that
what
it
said
here
that
arizona
made
by
this
compact
get
2.8
million
acre-feet
out
of
the
lower
basin's
share
and
then
it
went
on
and
said
that
arizona
can
have
all
the
gila
as
identifying
where
it's
coming
from.
well,
that
is
possibly,
grammatically
except
at
the
time
everybody
supposed
that
the
gila
have
three
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
in
it.
and
it
would
be
rather
silly
to
say
that
arizona
can
have
2.8
million
and
she
can
have
exclusively
out
of
the
gila,
when
the
gila
contained
3.5.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
i
don't
think
such
--
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
think
that
the
difference
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
so,
but
i
want
to
emphasize,
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court.
one
other
point
with
respect
to
the
second
paragraph,
if
you
put
the
first
--
if
you
look
at
the
first
paragraph
and
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
(a),
they
fit
together
on
our
reading,
very
neatly
as
two
halves
of
a
whole.
it's
like
taking
two
pieces
of
paper
which
looked
detached
and
you
find
it
suddenly
they
fit
together,
the
little
hole
which
i've
called
it
over
corresponds
to
the
dispute
about
the
meaning
of
the
word.
if
you
fold
it
out,
in
other
words,
if
you
read
it
our
way,
they
match
perfectly
which
seems
to
me
not
to
be
wholly
chance
as
indeed
the
legislative
history
shows.
mr.
archibald
cox
when
it
would
--
as
my
expression
showed,
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
significance
still,
it
is
--
i've
forgotten.
i
don't
know
of
any
particular
significance.
it
would
have
come
about
40
years,
wouldn't
it,
after
the
meeting
through
whatever
significance
that
may
have.
the
other
point
on
which
we
rely
for
--
to
sustain
our
reading
of
section
4
(a),
is
the
legislative
history
which
i
think
if
anyone
reads
it
through,
have
hardly
helped
concluding
that
it
demonstrates
almost
beyond
the
doubt
of
the
correctness
of
the
master's
reading
with
respect
at
least
to
what
congress
intended.
and
this
is
particularly
true
if
you
trace
the
events
through
from
the
initial
proposals
of
california
and
arizona
when
they
were
bargaining,
to
the
governor's
conference,
to
the
proposals
made
in
the
senate
and
then
down
through
the
sequence
of
the
various
amendments
to
the
final
vote.
i'm
not
going
to
ask
the
court
to
go
though
that
long
process
with
me
again
as
i
did
last
time,
but
there
are
five
points
concerning
the
legislative
history
that
i
would
simply
like
to
emphasize
so
that
if
any
of
the
justices
would
go
through
it
again,
you
may
bear
them
in
mind,
is
the
conclusions
which
we
think
should
be
particularly
noted.
first,
there
was
early
and
unanimous
agreement
that
arizona
should
have
the
waters
of
the
gila
river
in
addition
to
her
share
of
the
mainstream.
you'll
find
this
in
all
the
proposals
except
to
one
side
and
there
--
they
go
on
and
argue
about
the
mainstream.
mr.
archibald
cox
you'll
find
that
to
be
true.
i
think
the
explanation
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
reason
you
require
the
compact,
i
think,
justice
douglas,
with
respect
to
gila
was
because
it
would
deal
not
only
with
the
apportionment
portion
of
the
united
states
share
but
with
the
burden
of
the
mexican
treaty.
and
congress
apparently
was
not
undertaking
to
prescribe
a
solution
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
the
mexican
treaty.
as
to
that,
they
agreed
that
it
should
be
contingent
upon
a
compact
between
the
states.
i
think
that's
the
reason.
but
this
was
made
contingent
on
the
compact.
at
least,
it
certainly
is
an
adequate
reason
and
it
again
fits
in
with
the
legislative
history.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
didn't
observe
anything
else.
second,
as
i
said,
the
dispute
focused
upon
the
division
of
the
mainstream.
and
very
quickly
narrowed
to
the
question
whether
giving
nevada
full
of
300,000
acre-feet,
should
the
remaining
7.2
be
divided
4.6
to
california
and
2.6
to
arizona.
or
should
it
go
4.2
to
california
and
3
million
out
of
the
mainstream
to
arizona,
and
of
course
the
final
compromise
split
the
difference.
third,
everyone
who
spoke
assume
that
the
universe
to
be
divided
was
7.5
million
acre-feet
in
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river.
and
fourth
and
this
is
particularly
important,
i
think
justice
douglas,
throughout
the
legislative
history,
the
first
and
second
paragraphs
of
section
4
(a),
were
treated
as
--
as
conjunctive,
as
fitting
together.
indeed
through
merely
all
the
debate,
they
were
put
together
and
both
were
mandatory
rather
than
contingent
upon
a
compact.
they
were
two
parts
of
a
single
arrangement
and
this
gives
significance
to
what
i
was
saying
earlier.
finally,
every
senator
who
took
a
significant
part
in
the
discussion
explicitly
recognized
that
the
division
was
being
made
of
7.5
million
acre-feet
of
mainstream
water
plus
an
unascertained
surplus
in
the
mainstream.
you
find,
for
example,
after
the
amendment
was
passed
on
the
first
paragraph.
and
while
the
second
part
was
being
the
debated
that
senator
hiram
johnson
came
into
a
colloquy
with
senator
hayden
of
arizona.
senator
hayden
said,
“the
senator
fails
to
understand
that
there
are
two
elements
in
this
water
controversy.”
one
is
how
the
seven
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
to
be
divided
in
the
lower
basin.
the
senate
settled
that
by
vote,
california
may
have
4.4
million
acre-feet
of
the
water,
it
follows
logically
that
if
that
demand
is
to
be
conceded
as
everybody
agrees,
the
remainder
is
2
million
acre-feet
for
arizona.
that
settles
there.
mr.
johnson:
“how
much
from
the
gila?”
“whatever
is
in
it
that
is
ours
anyway.”
johnson:
“how
much
water
does
arizona
get
from
the
gila?”
and
then
hayden
said,
“well,
let's
take
your
figures.”
senator
johnson,
“my
figures
are
at
a
minimum,
three
and
a
half
million
acre-feet.”
mr.
hayden:
“yes”.
mr.
johnson:
“alright.
now,
in
the
division
of
water
that
the
senate
saw
fit
to
impose
yesterday,
arizona
had
2
million
acre-feet
and
3.5
million
acre-feet
from
the
gila,
did
not?”
this
is
senator
johnson
of
california,
and
mr.
hayden
said
“yes,
correct,
making
6,300,000
acre-feet.”
california
was
given
with
claims
of
protective
right,
4.4
million.
now,
there
you
see
that
we're
debating
the
set
to
what
became
the
second
paragraph
of
4
(a)
and
we're
debating
it
in
terms
of
mexican
treaty
wise,
which
i
think
confirms
the
explanation
that
i
suggested,
justice
douglas.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
4.4
million
came,
excuse
me.
senator
phipps'
statements
came
long
before
this.
they
came
before
the
senate
did
oppose
its
apportionment.
i
wouldn't
--
it's
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
fact,
i
didn't
think
he
said
it
came
out
of
system
water.
it
seemed
to
me,
he
did
call
attention
to
the
gila.
i
would
think
that
the
way
he
called
attention
to
the
gila
was
much
as
senator
johnson
did
on
the
colloquy
that
i
just
read.
he
said,
“don't
forget
that
arizona
also
has
the
gila”,
but
we
don't
have
in
front
of
it.
now,
i
must
come
to
a
point
very
closely
related
to
the
limitation
of
that
question,
but
one
which
is
a
little
bit
separate
and
that's
the
matter
of
the
diversions
from
the
mainstream
above
lake
mead.
the
master,
apparently
suppose
that
his
view
of
the
project
act,
in
section
4
(a),
compelled
him
to
leave
out
of
account,
compel
the
secretary
to
leave
out
of
account,
any
diversions
made
from
the
mainstream
above
lake
mead.
and
as
a
result,
he
invalidated
you
will
recall
the
provision
in
the
contract
between
the
secretary
and
arizona.
that
if
arizona
diverted
any
water
upstream
then
what
she
got
under
the
contract
should
be
reduced.
it's
seems
to
us
that
the
master
was
wrong
on
that
point.
before
coming
to
the
reasons,
it
might
be
worthwhile
to
illustrate
very
briefly
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
those
clauses
in
the
arizona
and
nevada
contract.
and
i
will
take
the
arizona
contract
for
an
illustration.
let's
suppose
being
very
optimistic,
there
were
eight
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
available
in
the
mainstream
below
lee
lake
--
below
lee
ferry
and
from
lake
mead.
under
the
project
act
and
the
contracts,
nevada
would
get
300,000,
california
would
get
4.4
million
and
--
plus
one
half
of
the
surplus
and
arizona
would
get
2.8
million
plus
it's
half
of
the
surplus
giving
california
a
total
of
4,900,000
on
my
assumption,
and
arizona
3,300,000.
now,
suppose
that
arizona
takes
a
million
of
the
8,500,000
out
above
marble
canyon,
now,
there
would
be
seven
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
available
from
lake
mead.
under
the
master's
view,
the
secretary
would
give
nevada
300,000,
california
4.4
million
and
arizona
2.8
million.
arizona
would
have
stolen
if
i
may
put
it
that
way
a
million
feet
upstream,
so
she
would
now
be
getting
3,800,000,
instead
of
the
3,300,000
she
would
get
if
it
all
came
from
lake
mead.
the
effect,
in
other
words,
on
my
supposition
as
to
figures
would
be
that
arizona
takes
california's
half
of
the
surplus.
the
disputed
clause,
if
valid,
of
course
prevents
this,
because
the
amount
taken
out
above
would
be
charged
against
what
she
was
entitled
to
get
from
lake
mead.
we
submit
that
the
clause
in
the
contract
is
valid
as
an
exercise
of
a
power
incidental
to
the
secretary's
power
to
make
contracts
for
the
waters
impounded
behind
hoover
dam.
the
predicate
upon
which
the
project
act
and
the
contracts
both
rest
is
that
lake
mead
and
hoover
dam
are
to
be
the
source
for
the
division
of
the
mainstream
waters
of
the
colorado
river.
what
the
disputed
clause
seeks
to
do
is
to
preserve
that
fundamental
condition
in
a
sense
or
at
least
to
treat
things
as
if
the
fundamental
condition
were
preserved,
in
the
event
that
one
party
seeks
to
change
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
because
the
little
colorado
river
is
not
a
part
of
the
lake
mead
water.
mr.
archibald
cox
up
to
that
part,
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
the
little
colorado
comes
in,
does
it
not,
below
--
mr.
archibald
cox
your
honor
is
quite
right
and
what
--
there
would
have
to
be
--
to
carry
this
out
exactly,
equal
--
a
similar
provision
with
respect
to
the
little
colorado
if
it
were
enough
worth
worrying
about.
mr.
archibald
cox
nevada
--
nevada
again
--
and
it
does
apply
to
the
upstream
tributaries.
mr.
archibald
cox
any
--
i
would
say
this
that
that
only
should
apply
but
as
i
remember
it
does
apply
to
any
water
that
flows
in
between
lee
ferry
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
to
lake
mead.
and
that
principle,
i
accept,
my
geography
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
was
wrong.
now,
i
suggested
earlier
that
what
the
secretary
was
doing
was
attempting
to
preserve
for
a
--
as
if
it
were
preserved,
a
fundamental
condition
of
the
contract.
this
is
a
rather
familiar
type
of
condition.
if,
i
promise
for
example
to
dig
a
200
foot
ditch
for
mr.
ely
at
the
rate
of
25
feet
a
day,
one
of
the
implied
conditions
will
be
that
he
mustn't
sleep
out
at
night
and
fill
in
ten
feet
every
night
that
i've
dug
that
day.
again,
if
i
promise
mr.
wilmer
to
deliver
him
daily,
5000
weighed
milk
for
my
dairy,
i'm
excused
from
performing
surely
to
the
extent
that
mr.
wilmer
steals
my
milk
for
my
cows.
the
case
here
is
in
principle,
i
submit,
just
the
same
as
the
latter
illustration.
furthermore,
it
seems
to
me
this
is
the
kind
of
incidental
power
that
an
agent
would
be
given
in
these
circumstances
even
if
it
was
not
spelled
out
in
so
many
words.
let's
suppose
for
example
that
i
were
authorized
by
a
large
dairy
farm
to
contract
for
the
delivery
of
its
milk,
surely
also
and
only
its
milk
so
that
i
wouldn't
be
authorized
to
sell
any
cows
but
surely,
i
would
be
impliedly
authorized
to
put
in
the
contract
a
covenant
that
the
obligation
to
make
daily
deliveries
should
be
reduced
by
the
extent
to
which
the
buyer
killed
the
cows
or
slipped
in
and
stole
the
milk
first.
and
that
is
all
we
say
that
the
secretary
was
doing
here.
now,
the
master
raised
two
objections.
he
said
that
these
clauses
in
the
contract
attempt
to
take
away
from
nevada
and
arizona
the
right
to
determine
priorities
intrastate.
we
deny
that
they
have
that
right
and
i
don't
want
to
debate
that
point
now.
but
even
if
they
have
it
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief,
this
is
not
true,
arizona
would
be
free
to
protect
the
downstream
appropriator
and
not
permit
the
diversions
upstream
under
her
law
as
it
is
today.
or
she
chose
to
change
her
law,
the
secretary's
contract
wouldn't
stand
in
the
way,
it
would
simply
determine
what
should
be
done
on
those
--
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
with
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
archibald
cox
state
of
nevada.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
the
other
objection
that
the
master
raised
is
he
said
this
would
make
the
secretary's
contracts
with
users
in
arizona
less
than
contracts
for
permanent
use.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
any
contract
for
permanent
use
is
certainly
contingent
under
being
water.
water
may
not
come
down
because
it
doesn't
rain,
but
it
may
also
come
down
because
somebody
--
not
come
down
because
somebody
has
lawfully
diverted
it
upstream
and
surely
permanent
is
subject
to
that
qualification.
so
we
think
that
the
contracts
themselves
are
not
only
consistent
but
authorized
under
the
master's
reading
of
section
4
(a)
and
that
they
could
perfectly
well
stand
on
that
reading
and
indeed
in
a
sense
confirm
it.
i
now
turn
therefore
to
the
other
main
issue
with
respect
to
the
mainstream.
the
matter
of
the
priority
issue
as
mr.
ely
has
called
it,
the
matter
of
ratable
deduction
as
it
might
be
called
in
times
of
shortage.
of
course,
we've
already
very
largely
answered
the
question.
what
is
to
be
--
about
priority
or
division
if
the
mainstream
is
seven
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
then
california
gets
4.4
million,
arizona
gets
2.8
million
and
nevada
gets
the
remaining?
if
it's
more
than
seven
and
a
half
million,
they
share
equally
or
this
is
spelled
out
in
the
act,
in
the
contracts
taken
together.
the
only
uncertainty
is
what
happens
when
less
than
seven
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
is
available,
and
on
this
point,
neither
the
project
act
nor
the
secretary's
contracts
given
explicit
answer
california's
thesis
reduced
to
its
simplest
terms
is
this,
the
central
theme
of
western
water
law
is
that
one
who
first
takes
the
claim
and
begins
construction
is
entitled
to
the
water
claim
that
the
boulder
canyon
project
was
put
down
in
that
legal
context
without
affecting
the
law
or
rights
on
the
river
except
for
the
california
limitation,
that
california
having
got
there
first
and
stated
out
the
claims,
is
entitled
to
have
them
satisfied
regardless
of
the
effect
upon
others
subject
again
only
to
the
limitation.
the
opposing
view
which
was
espoused
by
the
master
and
arizona
and
nevada
and
the
united
states,
centers
about
the
proposition
that
the
project
act,
taking
a
fresh
start
rejects
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
as
unsuited
to
the
development
of
the
colorado
river
basin.
and
under
--
and
especially
under
national
auspices,
and
instead
provides
its
own
rules
of
apportionment
to
be
filled
in
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
and
although
there's
no
expressed
provision
in
the
act
or
contracts
for
what
will
be
done
when
there
is
a
shortage
that
is
less
than
seven
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
because
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
assumed
there
wouldn't
be
any
shortage.
our
view
is
that
nevertheless
the
project
act
and
the
secretary's
contracts
contemplate
equality
of
rank
or
priority
among
the
states
in
respect
to
the
quantities
of
water
allocated
to
each
regardless
of
when
their
projects
were
undertaken.
now,
i
propose
to
develop
our
reasons
for
thinking
that
that
is
the
contemplation
of
the
project
act
and
the
secretary's
contract.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i'm
coming
to
that.
that's
an
important
--
excuse
me,
i
don't
mean
to
be
so
informal
but
it's
an
important
part
of
my
argument.
i'm
now
going
to
take
up
the
indications
and
the
situation
the
project
act
and
the
secretary's
practice
that
seemed
to
us
to
indicate
that
a
rule
of
ratability
is
much
more
consistent
with
the
act
and
the
contract
then
resort
to
the
law
of
prior
appropriation.
first,
in
interpreting
the
project
act,
we
submit,
that
the
court
should
keep
consequently
before
it,
two
dominant
facts.
one
is
that
the
chief
obstacle
to
the
development
of
the
colorado
river
basin
was
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
and
its
consequences.
the
need
was
to
assure
the
states'
equality
of
access
to
a
fair
share
of
the
water
whether
the
state
should
be
early
or
late
in
its
development.
but
the
upper
basin
states
were
worried
before
the
compact
was
signed,
about
the
record
growth
of
california
and
refused
to
support
any
colorado
river
project
within
--
until
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
should
be
set
aside
at
least
as
between
the
upper
and
lower
basin
so
that
they
would
have
equality
of
right
when
they
needed
the
water.
that
was
done
in
the
compact
as
between
the
upper
and
lower
basin.
similarly,
the
next
great
obstacle
to
undertake
into
the
project
was
the
fear
that
california
would
expand
its
uses
before
arizona.
so
arizona
said,
we
can't
ratify
the
compact
until
we're
guarded
against
this
consequence
of
the
law
of
prior
appropriation.
and
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
the
project
act,
we
think,
undeniably,
was
to
get
over
this
obstacle
to
beginning
the
project.
now,
the
second
dominating
fact
is
that
the
project
itself
would
show
so
far
over
overshadow
any
other
development
on
the
river
as
to
make
it
appropriate
to
take
a
fresh
start
in
the
delivery
--
in
the
division
of
the
water
provided
that
vested
rights
or
are
perfected
rights,
mr.
justice
stewart,
were
protected.
it's
the
vast
expenditures
by
the
united
states
for
the
hoover
dam
and
the
related
works
that
made
the
colorado
river
available
for
beneficial
use.
before
the
project
was
undertaken,
there
were
less
than
three
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
of
uses
downstream.
the
necessary
works
were
largely
at
the
mercy
of
the
river.
there
was
no
all-american
canal
to
carry
water
to
the
imperial
and
coachella
valleys,
twice
the
river
it
changed
its
course
so
that
none
of
these
people
downstream
would
have
any
water.
california
speaks
of
its
claim
the
water
for
the
metropolitan
water
district
as
a
prior
appropriated
rate,
but
the
truth
is
that
in
1929,
it
was
as
i
said
that
the
last
argument
just
to
gleam
in
somebody's
eye
or
at
least
some
surveyor's
maps.
and
it's
conceded
that
that
metropolitan
water
district
project
never
could
have
come
into
being
if
the
united
states
had
not
dealt
the
hoover
dam
and
started
to
plan
for
controlling
the
waters
of
the
river.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
would
be
--
that
would
present
the
same
difficulty
in
estimating
that
there
is
in
knowing
what
the
available
supply
is
today.
if
california
is
very
low
estimated
of
the
available
supply
of
5.8
million,
isn't
it?
if
we're
correct,
one
could
subtract
the
uses
in
1929
of
3.1
million
and
it
would
find
that
it
had
not
been
quite
doubled
but
it
must
--
you
must
remember
that
the
uses
before
1929
were
uncertain.
there
was
this
dam
through
mexico
in
which
there
was
some
trouble
with.
the
river
was
--
kept
changing
its
course
at
least
on
big
floods,
it
changed
its
course.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
what
one
could
have
said
in
1929
was
the
dependable
supply.
certainly,
if
they
went
into
the
south
case,
of
course,
again
and
started
emptying
into
the
salted
sea,
the
dependent
--
the
imperial
valley
would
have
no
dependable
supply
until
somebody
again
diverted
it.
i
think
that
it
certainly
--
the
river
--
the
project
more
than
doubled
the
reliable
uses
with
that.
turning
now
to
the
project
act,
we
find
in
it
ample
proofs
that
the
congress
did
take
a
fresh
start
based
upon
a
statutory
method
of
allocation.
section
1
of
the
project
act,
you'll
recall,
on
page
379,
authorizes
the
secretary
to
construct
and
operate
the
dam
and
incidental
works
in
the
mainstream
for
the
delivery
of
the
stored
water
thereof
for
the
reclamation
of
public
lands
and
other
beneficial
uses.
and
section
5
tells
him,
in
part,
how
he
is
to
do
that.
the
first
sentence
authorizes
him
under
--
that's
on
page
384,
authorizes
him
on
under
such
general
regulations
as
he
may
prescribe
to
contract
for
the
storage
of
water
in
said
reservoir
and
the
delivery
thereof.
and
then
the
last
sentence
of
section
5
over
at
the
top
of
385,
explicitly
states,
no
person
shall
have
or
be
entitled
to
have
the
use
for
any
purpose
of
water
stored
as
it
foresaid,
except
by
contract
made
as
herein
provided.
there
couldn't
be
any
clearer
evidence
of
the
intention
to
take
a
fresh
start.
rights
to
the
use
of
water
are
to
depend
on
contracts
with
the
secretary.
no
person
shall
have
any
right
to
the
use
of
the
water
unless
he
has
a
contract
made
under
the
statute.
now,
we
think
that
section
6,
turning
over
to
page
387,
not
only
confirms
our
idea
that
congress
was
taking
a
fresh
start
but
that
it
also
impliedly
excludes
any
notion
that
the
act
recognizes
or
requires
the
secretary
to
recognize
mere
appropriative
rights.
section
6
provides
the
dam
and
reservoir
provided
for
by
section
1
hereof
shall
be
used
first
to
river
regulation
and
so
forth;
second,
for
irrigation
and
domestic
uses
and
satisfaction
of
present
perfected
rights
in
pursuance
of
article
vii
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
article
8
of
the
colorado
river
compact
provided
present
perfected
rights
to
the
beneficial
use
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system
are
unpaired
--
unimpaired
by
this
compact.
you
see,
they
weren't
concerned
with
the
mere
appropriative
rights
but
present
perfected
rights.
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
when
the
storage
capacity
of
5
million
acre-feet
shall
have
been
provided
on
the
mainstream,
those
perfected
rights
shall
attach
to
the
stored
water
instead
of
the
original
flow.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
the
meaning
of
--
i
think
this
was
to
be
determined
of
course
first
by
the
secretary
because
he
is
instructed
to
use
the
water
for
this
purpose.
in
the
case
of
dispute,
i
would
suppose
that
an
appropriate
legal
action
could
be
brought
than
when
it
comes
to
what
substantive
rules
would
govern
which
is
perhaps
what
your
honor
had
in
mind.
let
me
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
the
present
perfected
rights.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
now,
this
requires
saying
the
word
about
the
nature
of
the
water
right.
a
water
right
one
begins
to
acquire
by
making
a
claim,
and
under
some
state
laws,
there
is
a
procedure
for
making
and
filing
a
claim.
and
then
he
begins
to
commence
the
construction
of
these
dams
and
ditches
and
anything
else
that
he
needs
to
get
the
water
and
apply
it
to
beneficial
use.
when
those
two
steps
have
been
taken,
the
appropriator
has
an
inchoate
right,
and
when
he
perfects
it,
it
will
then
date
back
to
the
time
when
he
made
the
claim
and
began
constructing
the
dams
and
ditches.
suppose,
for
example,
that
he
makes
his
claim
and
begins
construction
in
1925
and
the
he
finishes
the
water
and
applies
it
for
beneficial
use
in
1935.
when
he
does
it
under
the
law
of
prior
appropriation,
his
right
would
date
from
1925
and
it
would
take
precedence
over
a
person
who
says
began
his
project
and
finished
it
in
1930.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
not
at
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
simply
meant
mechanically,
the
secretary
would
determine.
mr.
archibald
cox
whether
it
be
state
or
federal
substantive
law.
so
far
as
i
know,
that
makes
no
causable
difference
in
this
context.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
right
which
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
there's
no
dispute
about
this.so
far
as
i
know
--
so
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
right
to
justice
black
which
would
be
perfected
under
the
law
of
one
state
in
1929,
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
and
which
might
not
be
a
perfected
right
at
that
time
if
you
took
some
federal
distillation
of
water
law
and
not
the
law
of
a
particular
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
but
i
suppose
that
since
these
were
well-known
terms,
present
perfected
right
and
in
a
minute,
i'll
get
back
to
stating
the
complete
definition
of
present
perfected
right
but
since
these
were
well-known
terms
in
the
law
of
all
these
western
states,
just
as
one
could
get
a
distillation
of
the
law
of
agency
so
one
could
get
a
distillation
of
a
perfected
right.
but
our
case
doesn't
at
any
sense
depend
on
this.
it
does
as
mr.
justice
black
suggests
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it's
before
anybody
now.
the
master
seems
to
have
supposed
that
what
was
a
perfected
right
in
1929
would
depend
on
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
man
claims
for
water.
and
where
so
far
as
the
perfected
right
goes,
entirely
contend
to
have
it
determine
according
to
that
law
except
in
the
case
of
the
indian
reservation.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
master
thought
that
state
law
was
to
control.
we
accepted
to
that
and
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
he
was
wrong
or
that
in
any
event
that
point
needs
not
to
be
decided
here.
i
don't
think
it
really
bears
on
the
place
that
i'm
now
here
to
argue.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
simply
argue
that
the
secretary
has
freedom
to
choose
following
the
instructions
in
the
statute,
what
lands
will
be
reclaimed
and
who
he
will
give
contracts
to.
once
he
gives
the
contracts
then
they
will
--
then
the
water
rights
under
ickes
and
fox
might
well
become
those
of
the
attached
part
of
the
land.
mr.
archibald
cox
entirely
aside
from
any
rights
except
present
perfected
rights.
i
think
we
ought
to
get
back
to
what
was
meant
by
perfect
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
instruction
to
respect
present
perfected
rights
is
an
implied
repudiation
of
the
notion
that
simply
mere
appropriative
rights
are
to
be
recognized
under
this
act.
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
let
me
--
let
me,
i
was
coming
to
that
a
few
moments
ago.
an
appropriative
right
is
one
that
can
be
used
to
cover
one
which
has
been
staked
out
construction
is
going
forward.
but
no
water
has
been
put
--
has
been
diverted
and
put
to
beneficial
use.
to
get
a
perfected
right,
under
the
law
of
all
the
western
water
states,
one
must
do
more.
he
must
divert
the
water
for
beneficial
use
and
in
most
states,
he
must
put
it
to
beneficial
use
as
well
divert
it
and
get
it
down
to
his
field.
and
it
is
only
when
he
has
put
it
to
the
use
and
it
is
only
to
the
extent
that
he
has
put
it
to
use
that
the
right
is
perfected.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
then
when
the
congress
spoke
in
1929,
a
present
perfected
right,
we
think
it
meant
those
that
were
perfected
by
that
time,
in
other
words,
for
our
purposes,
rights
perfected
prior
to
1929.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
was
a
widespread
--
universal,
i
think,
i
could
say
usage
of
the
term
perfected.
one
finds
in
kinney,
one
finds
in
the
state
of
washington
statutes.
one
finds
it
in
a
member
of
cases
and
that
i
think
really
there'd
be
no
room
for
dispute
as
to
what
is
necessary
to
perfect
a
right
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
may
be
true.
i
suppose
under
the
reclamation
act,
that
may
not
be
--
may
not
be
possible
because
it
must
be
pertinent
to
the
land.
but
otherwise
--
but
i
don't
think
we're
concerned
with
that
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
would
have
to
know
--
you
would
have
to
have
two
things.
you'd
have
to
know
what
were
the
rights
perfected
as
of
1929
and
you'd
have
to
know
how
much
water
arizona
could
get
through
the
secretary.
and
now,
the
secretary
told
arizona
that
how
much
arizona
users
could
get
from
the
secretary.
the
secretary
told
them
that,
the
only
question
is
whether
his
contract
with
arizona
is
valid
against
california's
claims.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
haven't
got
to
--
we
are
not
to
that
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
don't
think
anybody
suggest
that
there
are
any
substantial
number
of
rights
in
arizona
other
than
the
present
perfected
right
and
the
claims
of
the
indian
reservation
that
the
secretary
would
be
bound
to
respect,
so
my
first
answer
is
i
just
don't
think
there
are
enough
for
them
to
worry
about
although
the
arizona
counsel
can
say
better
than
i.
second,
we
do
argue,
i
hesitate
to
take
time
for
it.
we
do
argue
in
a
brief
that
it
is
up
to
the
secretary
to
decide
with
whom
he
will
contract
and
that
state
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
think
that's
consistent
with
the
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
agree
with
that
completely,
mr.
justice
black.
we
have
so
argued
in
that
brief
that
there
is
no
occasion
for
the
master
to
express
himself
upon
it
and
that
there
is
no
occasion
for
us
to
discuss
it
now.
the
real
question
is
only
down
to
the
level
of
the
allocation
to
the
several
states.
and
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
is
the
taking
of
our
definition
of
present
perfected
right
which
i
haven't
heard
seriously
disputed
the
master's
definition.
then
the
fact
that
the
congress
said
with
respect
to
present
perfected
right
is
a
strong
indication
that
the
congress
was
not
concerned
with
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
that
it
was,
as
i
say,
taking
a
fresh
start.
now,
that
i
think
follows
by
way
of
interest
with
three
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
having
mentioned
one
that
almost
impliedly
excludes
the
other;
second,
the
--
if
the
congress
assumed
that
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
was
to
be
in
effect,
there
was
no
reason
to
direct
anybody
to
respect
present
perfected
rights
because
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
would
cover
those
rights
as
well
as
the
broader
class
of
those
that
haven't
been
perfected;
the
third
reason
is,
that
the
direction
to
respect
present
perfected
right
is
inconsistent
with
recognizing
the
law
of
prior
appropriations
because
one
may
get
a
perfected
right
before
1929,
which
under
the
statute
would
be
senior
and
specifically
senior
to
the
unperfected
claims
of
the
california
metropolitan
water
district
and
the
excess
claim,
the
increased
use
claim
of
the
of
the
imperial
valley
which
of
course
ancillary
restraints
the
two
claims
as
to
which
this
is
important.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
there
is
ample
scope
for
the
provisions
of
the
reclamation
law
without
their
bearing
on
this.
i
would
answer
the
argument
based
upon
as
section
18
or
14,
whichever
it
is,
that
incorporates
the
reclamation
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
one
does
expressly
and
the
other
doesn't.
if
the
one
that
does
expressly
says,
“except
as
herein
provided.”
on
the
first
place,
we
say
that
it
is
otherwise
herein
provided.
mr.
archibald
cox
section
--
thank
you
sir.
second,
there
is
nothing
in
the
reclamation
law
that
deals
with
the
claim
--
the
apportionment
of
water
interstate.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
understood
that
part
of
nebraska
and
wyoming,
you
said
that
under
the
reclamation
law,
the
states,
the
united
states
was
not
entitled
to
a
separate
apportionment
because
the
states
were
there
to
represent
the
beneficiaries
of
contracts
with
the
secretary.
but
that
wouldn't
indicate
that
the
reclamation
law
supplied
a
rule
for
dividing
this
water
between
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
perhaps
--
i
simply
have
to
submit
my
reading
of
the
case,
perhaps
i've
got
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
really
don't
think
that
we're
trying
to
argue
that
proposition
today
perhaps
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
with
all
my
life
to
do
it
(voice
overlap)
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
don't
think
it's
involved
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
submit
by
way
of
comment
on
the
reclamation
act
is
that
as
we
understand
the
way
this
court
has
construed
the
reclamation
act
in
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act.
it
has
never
held
that
the
reclamation
act
requires
the
secretary
to
observe
state
law
in
deciding
what
lands
will
be
reclaimed
and
who
will
get
the
benefits
of
contracts
with
it.
now,
it
had
--
does
tell
him
as
was
recognized
in
the
gerlach
case
that
the
secretary
in
getting
rights
for
reclamation
project
is
to
respect
the
laws
of
divested
rights
within
the
states.
and
in
ickes
and
fox,
it
was
indicated
that
to
some
undefined
extent,
a
state
law
might
affect
the
rights
of
those
who
have
contracts
with
the
secretary.
but
in
the
ivanhoe
case,
the
court
said
and
i
know
no
case
contrary
to
it,
that
when
it
came
to
determining
--
to
running
the
project,
to
determining
who
would
get
the
contract
that
the
reclamation
act
did
not
bind
the
secretary.
but
i
want
--
i
really
think
this
is
beside
the
main
point
here.
the
point
i'm
seeking
to
emphasize
is
that
they
didn't
take
a
fresh
start
and
that
the
start
that
they
took
seem
to
repudiate
the
law
of
prior
appropriation.
now,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
presume
that
there
are
some
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
implied
restrictions.
i
was
going
to
say
and
i
think
this
answers
your
questions
justice
black.
really,
the
point
we're
concerned
with,
i
think
justice
douglas,
is
antecedent
to
that.
what
we
say
is
that
the
secretary,
being
bound
by
the
general
guidance
of
the
statute,
has
the
authority
to
say
that
nevada
gets
300,000
acre-feet
and
arizona
gets
2.8
million,
and
they
made
contracts
with
the
california
users
within
her
allocations.
mr.
archibald
cox
now
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
we
don't
think
that
question
has
to
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
our
--
that's
our
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
would
like
to
keep
the
two
separate
because
i
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
he
must
have
reference
to
the
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
statute
gives
very
considerable
instruction.
for
example,
it
gives
instructions
as
the
section
has
been
mentioned
before
in
the
argument
and
i
think
not
from
the
brief.
but
you
will
note
that
there
are
instructions
over
in
section
9
about
who
shall
have
the
first
opportunity
to
get
contracts
with
the
secretary
on
reclaimed
lands
of
federal
instruction.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
several
indications
which
i
would
like
to
mention
very
briefly,
both
in
the
project
act
and
in
the
compact
that
the
right
of
the
states
which
was
pretty
well
marked
out
by
section
4
of
the
project
act,
the
secretary
doesn't
have
any
real
discretion
in
that
respect,
are
to
be
treated
readily.
in
the
project
act,
in
the
compact,
i
should
say,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
three
that
treat
these
sovereign
bodies
also
this
instance
in
terms
of
upper
basin
and
the
lower
basin
groups
of
state
as
equal.
the
first
place
is
the
basic
division.
and
article
iii
(a)
is
made
regardless
of
the
volume
of
prior
appropriations
in
either
state.
article
iii
(c)
provides
that
if
the
surplus
over
15
million
acre-feet
in
the
river
is
not
enough
to
satisfy
the
obligations
of
the
mexican
treaty
then
the
two
basins
are
to
share
equally,
rule
of
ratability.
article
iii
(f)
which
preserves
the
surplus
against
the
claims
of
prior
appropriation,
again,
seems
to
repudiate
that
as
a
rule.
now,
the
project
act,
the
limitation
to
4.4
million
acre-feet
if
you
construe
it
as
the
master
did,
clearly,
didn't
recognize
all
california's
prior
appropriated
claims.
arizona
and
california
are
treated
equally
and
they
share
up
and
down
ratably
in
any
surplus
over
the
seven
and
half
million.
section
4
(b),
also
dependent
upon
a
compact,
nevertheless
seems
to
treat
the
states
as
of
equal
in
rank,
also
not
necessarily
in
the
amounts
of
water.
and
finally,
in
the
debates
in
congress,
there
was
no
--
no
one
ever
suggested
that
the
sovereign
state
should
have
anything
but
equality
in
the
rank
of
their
class.
finally,
i
would
point
out
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
times
of
shortage
and
reclamation
project
frequently
makes
a
ratable
distribution
of
the
available
water.
and
that
not
infrequently
is
spelled
out
in
contract
so
that
this
practice
plus
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
couldn't
say.
i
had
the
current
practice
in
mind
that
some
of
them
are
earlier
project.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
