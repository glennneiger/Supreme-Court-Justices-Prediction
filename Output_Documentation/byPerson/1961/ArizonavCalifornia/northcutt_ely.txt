mr.
northcutt
ely
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
northcutt
ely
there
are
two
main
points
of
controversy
arising
out
of
the
master's
report,
mr.
justice
douglas.
that
is
a
one
often
them,
what
we
call
the
limitation
issue.
that
is
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
the
quantities.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
second
is
a
question
of
priorities
of
judge
(inaudible).
mr.
northcutt
ely
which
of
our
brief?
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
your
honor.
the
80,000
acre-feet
is
the
quantity
of
uses
in
arizona
and
the
nevada
which
would
not
be
safely
protected
by
what
we
call
the
safe
annual
yield
of
the
river.
that
is
their
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
only
risk.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
if
our
proposal
were
adopted,
all
of
the
existing
arizona-nevada
projects
would
be
fully
protected
out
of
the
safe
dependable
supply
of
the
colorado
river
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
except
for
the
80,000
people,
whereas,
under
our
own
proposal,
if
our
estimate
of
the
water
supply
is
correct,
then
we
are
not
in
that
favored
position.
we
would
have
available
to
us
out
of
the
dependable
supply
some-800,000
acre-feet
less
than
the
capacity
of
our
constructive
projects.
we
would
available
4,600,000.
their
capacity
is
5,400,000.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
sir,
not
at
all.
not
at
all,
if
i
may
say.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
sir,
not
at
all.
the
80,000
acre-foot
figure
is
the
margin
which
arizona
and
nevada
projects
would
have
it
at
risk.
the
balance
of
their
uses
for
their
full
requirement
should
be
ordered
is
1,200,000
acre-feet
when
fully
--
when
fully
completed.
all
of
that
except
80,000
is
protected
out
of
what
we
call
the
safe
annual
yield
of
the
dependable
supply,
no
risk
at
all
involved.
we
concede
them
in
such
in,
say,
full
supply.
we
are
not
in
that
happy
position.
the
controversy
between
arizona
and
california
rising
from
the
master's
report
is
of
the
magnitude
of
1,200,000
acre-feet,
not
80,000.
your
honor
--
your
honors,
there
are
three
issues
which
i
propose
to
argue
arising
out
of
the
master's
report.
i
shall
use
them
for
ready
identification,
namely,
the
limitation
issue,
the
priority
issue,
and
the
water
supply
or
justiciability
issue.
first,
may
i
explain
what
i
mean
by
the
limitation
issue.
all
three
of
these,
i
may
say,
arise
out
of
these
questions
of
law
out
of
his
interpretation
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
in
its
relation
to
the
colorado
river
compact
and
a
third
statute,
the
statute
of
california
called
the
california
limitation
act.
i'll
explain
this
as
i
go
along,
but
all
three
of
them
were
proclaimed
to
be
in
effect
simultaneously
on
june
25,
1929
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
they
use
interlocking
terms,
the
same
terms,
and
our
basic
quarrel
with
the
master
is
that
he
assigns
interpretations
to
the
same
words
in
the
colorado
river
compact
and
the
california
limitation
act
in
diametrically
opposite
directions.
this
is
the
limitation
issue.
may
i
refer
to
the
map
and,
to
--
along
with
it,
the
reprint
which
you
have
before
you
of
section
4
(a)
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act,
article
iii
(a)
of
the
colorado
river
compact
and
section
5
of
the
project
act.
section
--
these
statutes
came
to
--
into
existence
in
this
way.
the
colorado
river
compact
was
an
agreement
among
the
seven
states
of
the
colorado
river
basin
shown
on
the
map
behind
me,
map
a,
in
1922.
all
promptly
ratified
it
in
1923,
except
arizona
for
reasons
which
i'll
come
to.
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
was
approved
by
the
president
on
december
21,1928.
it
authorized
the
construction
of
the
hoover
dam
and
the
all-american
canal
and
they
gave
consent
to
the
colorado
river
compact
but
it
made
the
construction
of
these
works,
the
authority
to
construct
them,
conditional
upon
the
president's
proclamation
that
either
seven
states
had
ratified
the
colorado
river
compact
or
if
arizona
refused
to
--
continue
to
refuse
to
do
so.
then,
upon
this
proclamation,
that
six
states
would
ratify
it,
including
california,
and
that,
in
addition
in
that
event,
california
should
have
enacted
a
limitation
act
limiting
her
rights
in
the
colorado
river
system.
these
things
were
all
done.
arizona
did
not
ratify,
six
states
did,
including
california,
california
passed
a
limitation
act,
the
proclamation
was
so
issued
on
june
25,
1929.
the
specific
issue
of
statutory
construction
involved,
first,
on
the
limitation
issue
is
this.
if
i
may
refer
to
the
reprint
of
section
4
(a),
this
is
the
section
that
prescribed
that
the
project
act
should
become
operative
only
upon
the
satisfaction
of
this
conditions.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir,
distributed
to
the
members
of
the
court.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
thank
you.
this
section
provides
that
the
act
shall
not
become
effect
--
become
--
not
take
effect,
these
were
the
opening
words,
until
certain
conditions
are
carried
out.
the
first
appears
on
page
1.
until,
one,
the
states
of
arizona,
california,
and
so
on
ratify
the
compact
and
the
president
proclaims
or
two,
if
the
seven
states
fail
to
ratify,
then
until
the
alternative
takes
place.
the
alternative
is
six-state
ratification
plus
enactment
by
california
of
a
limitation
act
which,
and
as
to
this
we
have
placed
that
requirement
in
italics
on
the
first
page,
“until
the
state
of
california,
by
act
of
its
legislature,
shall
agree
irrevocably
and
unconditionally
with
the
united
states
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
states
of
arizona,
colorado,
nevada,
new
mexico,
utah,
and
wyoming
as
an
expressed
covenant
and
in
consideration
of
the
passage
of
this
act
that
the
aggregate
annual
consumptive
use,
diversions
less
returns
to
the
river
of
water
of
and
from
the
colorado
river
for
use
in
the
state
of
california,
including
all
uses
under
contracts
made
under
the
provisions
of
this
act
and
all
water
necessary
for
the
supply
of
any
rights
which
may
now
exist
shall
not
exceed.”
and
here
we
come
to
the
two
components
of
the
limitation,
"one,
4,400,000
acre-feet
of
the
waters
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
states
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
the
second
component,
plus
not
more
than
one-half
of
any
excess
or
surplus
waters
unapportioned
by
said
compact,
such
uses
always
to
be
subject
of
the
terms
of
said
compact."
article
iii
(a)
of
the
colorado
river
compact
appears
on
page
4
of
this
reprint
and
it
says,
"there
is
hereby
apportioned
from
the
colorado
river
system,
in
perpetuity
to
the
upper
basin
and
to
the
lower
basin
respectively,
the
exclusive
beneficial
consumptive
use
of
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
water
per
annum
which
shall
include
all
water
necessary
for
the
supply
of
any
rights
which
may
now
exist."
the
specific
issue
with
respect
to
this
language
arises
on
page
173
of
the
master's
--
special
master's
report
where
he
says
this,
"i
have
concluded
that
congress
intended,
in
limiting
california
to
4.4
million
acre-feet
of
the
waters
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
states
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact,
simply
to
limit
california's
annual
uses
of
water
to
4.4
out
of
7.5
million
acre-feet.”
congress
referred
to
article
iii
(a)
of
the
compact
solely
as
a
short-hand
way
of
saying
7,500,000
acre-feet
per
annum.
this
inappropriate
reference
to
the
compact
has
been
the
cause
of
seeming
inconsistency
in
the
act
and
of
much
confusion
in
its
interpretation.
reflection
has
led
to
the
conviction
that
the
statutory
language
does
not
accurately
express
the
true
congressional
intention.
thus,
i
hold
that
section
4
(a)
of
the
project
act
and
the
california
limitation
act
refer
only
to
the
water
stored
in
lake
mead
and
flowing
in
the
mainstream
below
hoover
dam
despite
the
fact
that
article
iii
(a)
of
the
compact
deals
with
the
colorado
river
system
which
is
defined
in
article
ii
(a)
as
including
the
entire
mainstream
and
the
tributaries.
the
effect
of
this
distinction
is
shown
upon
the
map
a
and
also
in
map
b.
i
refer
to
map
a.
here,
shown
in
red
is
that
segment
of
the
main
colorado
river
which
the
master
refers
to
as
the
"mainstream,"
a
word
of
art
in
the
report
meaning
lake
mead
and
below.
that
is
shown
in
this
map
in
red.
the
colorado
river
system,
as
he
correctly
defines
it,
is
not
the
area
in
red.
it
is
the
segment
in
red
plus
the
river
shown
in
blue.
the
difference,
mathematically,
is
this.
the
colorado
river
system,
as
defined
by
the
colorado
river
compact,
includes
all
the
tributaries
as
well
as
the
main
river.
he
so
holds
correctly,
we
believe.
the
uses
--
the
supply
of
the
tributaries
in
the
lower
basin,
that
is
the
area
on
map
a
shown
in
white
below
the
shaded
area,
the
uses
supplied
supported
by
the
tributaries
are
the
general
order
of
two
million
acre-feet
per
annum.
that,
by
the
terms
of
the
colorado
river
compact,
is
included
within
the
iii
(a)
apportionment.
these
are
rights
which
may
now
exist
in
1929.
in
any
event,
they
are
long
since
put
to
use
and
they
are
accountable,
basin
versus
basin,
as
part
of
the
lower
basin
apportionment.
the
total
apportionment
to
the
lower
basin
made
by
article
iii
(a)
is
seven
and
one
half
million
acre-feet
including
that
resource.
by
a
simple
subtraction,
therefore,
whenever
the
upper
basin
invokes
against
the
lower
basin
the
“limitations
on
appropriations,”
as
he
calls
them,
the
ceilings
on
appropriations
provided
by
article
iii
(a),
seven-and-a
half
million
in
total.
then,
out
of
the
main
river,
arizona,
california,
nevada
may
take
within
that
iii
(a)
ceiling
only
5.5
million
acre-feet.
nevertheless,
the
master
interprets
the
language
i
just
read
to
you,
section
4
(a)
of
the
project
act
and
the
identical
language
in
the
california
limitation
act,
which
is
the
operating
statute
or
self
limitation,
as
meaning
that
the
three
states
were
intended
to
divide
up
7.5
million
acre-feet
out
of
the
region
--
the
segment
shown
in
red.
there
is,
thus,
a
built-in
shortage.
significantly,
note
the
main
river
between
lee
ferry,
the
division
point
between
the
upper
and
lower
basin,
and
lake
mead.
it
is
shown,
here,
in
blue.
that
is
because
the
master
specifically
redefines
the
main
river
itself
between
lee
ferry
and
lake
mead
as
a
tributary.
he
says,
in
so
many
words,
it
is
intended
to
be
treated
exactly
as
a
tributary.
now,
the
--
this
has
a
number
of
a
--
it
presents
a
number
of
problems.
the
second
component
of
the
limitation,
which
appears
on
page
2
of
this
reprint,
provides
plus
not
more
than
one-half
of
any
excess
or
surplus
waters
unapportioned
by
said
compact.
the
quarrel
between
arizona
and
california
that
was
pleaded
here
was
whether
or
not
that
second
component
does
or
does
not
permit
california
to
share
in
the
advantages
of
article
iii
(b)
of
the
colorado
river
compact
which
is
printed
at
page
373
of
the
report.
article
iii
(b)
provides
that,
in
addition
to
the
apportionment
made
in
paragraph
(a),
the
lower
basin
is
hereby
given
the
right
to
increase
its
beneficial
consumptive
use
of
such
waters
by
one
million
acre-feet
per
annum.
arizona
contended
that
we
were
precluded
--
excluded
from
that
million
acre-feet
in
the
second
component.
we
said
we're
entitled
to
participate.
the
master
decides
that
in
our
favor
that,
on
the
phase
of
the
statutory
language,
california
is
not
excluded.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
think
you're
correct,
your
honor.
we
do
--
we're
happy
to
accept
his
determination
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
but,
as
i'll
now
show
you,
mathematically,
he
does
exclude
us
from
the
benefit
of
that
holding
and
have
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
believe
you're
correct
and
we
hope
so.
we
think
that
issue
is
out
of
the
case
and
we
have
won
that
one.
we
disagree
with
the
special
master
as
to
the
--
the
reason
but
i
shall
not
in
to
that
at
the
moment.
but,
as
i
shall
show
you
now,
we
are
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
you're
correct.
you're
correct,
mr.
justice.
as
i
shall
now
endeavor
to
show
you,
however
--
or
the
issue
initially
was
and
the
one
presented
here
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
issue,
and
i'll
demonstrated
by
this
chart
mathematically,
if
i
may
have
chart
one
please.
chart
one
is
before
you
in
a
small
reproduction
and
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
you
do
not
have
small
reproductions
of
it.
it's
only
upon
that.
now,
line
one
of
this
chart
shows
the
article
iii
(a)
apportionment
to
the
lower
basin.
let
me
stop
here
and
say
the
master
throughout
holds
that
these
"apportionments"
are
truly
ceilings
on
appropriations.
now,
this
is
a
distinction
that
may
be
more
than
just
words.
the
apportionment
to
the
upper
basin
of
7.5
half
million
acre-feet
per
year
is
a
ceiling
on
appropriations,
not
on
upper
basin
appropriations
somehow
but
upon
--
it's
a
ceiling
imposed
for
our
protection.
let
me
explain
this
rather
curious
feature
of
the
master's
report,
whereas
the
compact
purports
to
apportion
in
perpetuity
to
the
upper
basin
seven-and-a
half
million
and
to
the
lower
basin
seven-and-a
half
million.
he
treats
these
as
reciprocal
ceilings
on
appropriations.
the
protection
to
the
upper
basin
is
not
the
apportionment
made
in
perpetuity
to
that
basin
but
the
upper
basin's
right
to
invoke
against
the
lower
basin
a
seven
and
one
half
million
acre-foot
ceiling
on
our
appropriations
found
in
the
apportionment
to
us.
so,
also
with
this
million
acre-feet,
iii
(b)
right
of
the
increase
of
use.
in
other
words,
the
upper
basin
may,
when
it
needs
the
water,
impose
upon
the
lower
basin
the
enforcement
of
these
ceilings,
8.5
half
million
acre-feet
on
our
appropriations.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
they
are
reciprocal
undoubtedly
but
instead
of
treating
the
apportionment
to
the
upper
basin
as
a
reservation
in
perpetuity
like
that
for
an
indian
reservation
or
what
it
calls
it,
“an
apportionment
in
perpetuity,”
instead,
the
protection
for
the
upper
basin
is
not
that
apportionment
to
them
but
their
right
to
invoke
the
reciprocal
ceiling
on
our
appropriations.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
but
they
may
never
get
up
to
that
point
because
the
water
supply
may
not
support
it.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir,
there
quite
probably
is.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
because
of
a
probability
that
the
water
supply
will
never,
never
support
in
fact
15
million
or
16
million
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use.
the
problem
of
shortage
that
we
face
is
not
contingent
upon
the
upper
basin
putting
to
use
seven-and-a
half
million
acre-feet.
it
is
contingent
upon
the
point
being
reached
where
they
have
to
invoke
the
ceiling
on
our
appropriations.
now,
to
--
they
may
have
to
do
that
to
build
up
uses
for
themselves
or
more
of
anything
more
than
four
million.
in
other
words,
we
do
not
face
a
happy
possibility
that
shortage
will
not
hit
us
until
the
upper
basin
uses
7.5
million
acre-feet.
to
the
contrary,
shortage
will
hit
us
when
they
invoke
the
ceilings
on
our
appropriations
to
permit
them
to
use
four
or
four-and-a
half
or
five
million
acre-feet.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
i
think
it's
quite
the
contrary,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because,
as
i
shall
indicate
by
another
chart
in
a
moment,
we're
practically
up
to
that
ceiling
right
now.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
was
based
upon
the
estimate
then
available
as
to
reasonable
--
reasonable
apportionments.
the
chart
on
the
rack
behind
me
illustrates
the
effect
of
the
master's
interpretation.
the
article
iii
(a)
apportionment
appears
in
line
1,
7.5
million
acre-feet.
the
article
iii
(b)
item,
the
right
to
increase
the
lower
basin's
use
by
1
million
is
in
line
two.
the
total
compact
imposed
ceiling
on
the
lower
basin
whenever
the
compact
is
invoke
is,
thus,
eight-and-a
half
million
acre-feet,
but
that
encompasses
the
uses
on
the
tributaries
which
are
of
the
order
of
2
million
acre-feet.
consequently,
the
residents
should
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
please.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
the
quantity
in
fact
being
used
at
the
present
time
with
respect
to
the
gila
river,
the
greatest
of
these
tributaries.
it
is
also
its
full
dependable
production.
it
is
fully
put
to
use.
with
respect
to
the
other
tributaries,
200,000
acre-feet
of
thereabout
is
used
from
them.
they
produce
more
than
that
but
the
excess
flows
into
the
main
river
and
is
a
part
of
the
main
river
supply
already
appropriated
there.
mr.
northcutt
ely
5.5.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
used
by
diversion
from
the
main
river.
the
physical
supply
that
reaches
us
in
--
comes
mostly
from
the
inflow
at
lee
ferry
but
also
it
is
supplemented
by
the
inflow
of
the
tributaries
above
hoover
dam
which,
upon
the
map
a
or
b,
are
the
virgin
river
coming
in
from
utah
and
the
--
by
arizona
and
nevada
and
the
little
colorado
coming
in
from
new
mexico
and
arizona.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right,
sir.
that
is
right.
that's
entirely
outside
the
scope
of
the
decree
of
writ.
now,
the
2
million
acre-feet
on
the
tributaries
is
encompassed
within
the
compact
ceiling
or
apportionments
to
lower
basin.
the
residue
available
out
of
the
mainstream,
therefore,
is
not
over
6.5
million
acre-feet
for
appropriation
by
arizona,
california,
nevada
whenever
the
compact
ceilings
are
enforced
against
the
lower
basin.
now,
if
i
may
anticipate
my
argument
somewhat,
the
last
segment
of
this
chart
shows
the
effect
of
the
master's
report
upon
california
because
he
allocates
to
california
44/75,
as
mr.
douglas
pointed
out
earlier,
of
the
quantity
available
from
lake
mead
and
below.
if
it's
7.5
million
or
less,
we
get
44/75
of
it.
44/75
of
6.5
million
is
3.8
million
acre-feet
for
california.
now,
the
second
--
now,
may
i
pause
here
to
say
that
if
the
language
in
the
limitation
means
the
colorado
river
system
and
the
area
in
the
red
plus
the
area
in
blue
in
the
lower
basin,
you
have
no
problem
of
shortage
in
meeting
the
appropriations
up
to
the
compact
ceiling
because
they're
written
in
the
same
terms.
the
production,
as
was
called
a
moment
ago,
of
the
tributaries
plus
the
5.5
million
we
may
appropriate
out
of
the
main
river
will
supply
8.5
million
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use.
you
reach
no
problem
of
shortage
in
that
respect,
but
if
they
--
if
the
limitation
is
severed
from
the
compact
and
given
a
separate
interpretation,
if
the
quantity
is
covered
by
the
limitation
or
the
area
in
red,
you
have
this
built-in
shortage.
you
cannot
supply
7.5
million
acre-feet
from
lake
mead
and
below
out
of
a
supply
limited
by
the
compact
to
6.5
million,
and
that
brings
us
to
the
second
issue
of
the
master
of
what
he
does
about
this
shortage.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
let
met
come
to
grips
at
once
with
that.
i
take
it,
you're
referring
perhaps
to
article
iii
(d)
of
the
compact.
article
iii
(d)
which,
perhaps
we
should
refer
to
at
the
master's
report
at
about
page
373,
is
an
entirely
separate
provision
of
the
compact
which
says
this.
that
the
states
of
the
upper
division,
that's
colorado,
new
mexico,
utah
and
wyoming
will
not
cause
the
flow
of
the
river
at
lee
ferry
to
be
depleted
below
an
aggregate
of
75
million
acre-feet
for
any
period
of
10
consecutive
years
reckoned
in
continuing
progressive
series
beginning
with
the
first
day
of
october
next,
exceeding
the
ratification
of
this
compact.
a
guarantee
of
a
minimum
supply
at
lee
ferry
of
75
million
acre-feet
for
10
years.
one
of
the
issues
initially
in
this
case
was
the
contention
by
arizona
that
this
75
million
is
the
same
thing
as
the
7.5
million
acre-feet
referred
to
in
article
iii
(a).
the
master
rejects
that
contention
and
does
so
properly
in
our
review.
and,
i
--
well,
at
page
144,
he
disposes
of
that.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
raise
the
same
question
here,
your
honor.
when
we
moved
to
join
them,
the
court
ruled
against
us
by
a
divided
vote.
the
mater
does
construe
the
compact.
it's
a
foundation
of
his
report,
although
he
says
that
it
cannot
be
construed
it
their
absence.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
it
is
a
--
the
compact
is
truly
relevant
as
it's
intertwined
throughout
his
report
in
a
way
i've
just
described,
but
it's
relevant
in
another
sense,
to
which
i'll
come
to
on
the
third
issue
of
justiciability.
the
master,
as
you'll
see
in
the
page
i'm
about
to
read
from,
does
construe
the
compact.
he
does
so
repeatedly
throughout
his
report.
if
he
didn't,
he
couldn't
reach
the
conclusion
he
does.
he
says
that,
lastly,
arizona
argues
that
article
iii
(a)
relates
to
the
mainstream
only
because
iii
(a)
and
iii
(d)
are
correlative.
iii
(d),
being
iii
(a)
multiplied
by
10,
and
article
iii
(d)
is
fairly
a
mainstream
measurement.
this
argument
is
unacceptable
since
article
iii
(a)
imposes
a
limit
upon
appropriation
whereas
iii
(d)
deals
will
the
supply
at
lee
ferry,
an
interpretation
which
makes
these
two
provisions
correlative,
one
to
another,
as
inadmissible
since
a
substantial
quantity
of
water
is
lost
through
reservoir
of
operation
and
channel
losses
as
it
flows
from
lee
ferry,
the
point
where
the
iii
(d)
obligation
is
measured,
to
the
diversion
points
downstream
from
hoover
dam
where
most
of
the
appropriations
are
made.
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
water
at
lee
ferry
will
supply
a
considerably
smaller
amount
of
appropriations
below
hoover
dam.
moreover,
iii
(a)
extends
to
appropriations
on
lower
basin
tributaries,
as
well
as
the
mainstream.
such
appropriations
cannot
possibly
have
any
relation
to
the
quantitative
measurement
of
the
flow
of
the
water
at
lee
ferry.
we
think
he's
entirely
correct
on
that.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
do,
indeed.
yes,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
was
from
page
144.
mr.
northcutt
ely
let
me
be
sure
if
my
reference
is
correct.
now,
this
brings
me
to
the
question
what
the
master
does
about
this
built-in
shortage.
if
the
compact
is
enforced,
this
brings
us
to
what
they
call
a
priority
issue.
this
issue
arises
primarily
from
his
interpretation
of
section
5
of
the
project
act
which
is
also
reprinted
in
the
folder
you
have
before
you
and
primarily
from
the
first
and
last
sentences
of
section
5.
section
5
provides
that
the
secretary
of
interior
is
hereby
authorized,
under
such
general
regulations
as
he
may
prescribe,
to
a
contract
for
the
storage
of
water
in
said
reservoir
and
for
the
delivery
thereof
at
such
points
on
the
river
and
on
said
canal
as
may
be
agreed
upon
for
irrigation
and
domestic
uses.
it
goes
on
with
generation
of
electric
power,
recovery
of
cost,
and
so
on.
and,
concludes
with
the
final
sentence,
contracts
respecting
water
for
irrigation
and
domestic
uses
shall
be
for
permanent
service
and
shall
conform
to
paragraph
(a)
of
section
4
of
this
act.
"no
person
shall
have
or
be
entitled
to
have
the
use
for
any
purpose
of
the
water
stored
as
aforesaid
except
by
contract
made
as
herein
stated.”
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
right.
mr.
northcutt
ely
substantially
so.
he
rejects
our
contention
that
shortage
is
inevitable
by
holding
that
there's
no
assurance
whatever,
noting
to
indicate
that
the
compact
will
ever
be
invoked
against
us.
there's
nothing
to
show
that
projects
will
be
built
in
the
upper
basin
to
a
level
which
will
require
the
invocation
of
the
ceiling
upon
our
appropriations.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
unfortunately,
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
issue
of
the
rapidity
of
upper
basin
development
was
not
litigated.
such
references
as
are
in
the
record
are
truly
thereby
accident.
unfortunately,
the
facts
are
just
dead
against
the
master's
optimistic
interpretation
as
our
expectation,
as
i'll
indicate
by
committee
reports
in
congress
and
by
a
simple
mathematical
subtraction.
we
are
living
obviously
on
borrowed
water
and
borrowed
time
if
we
use
more
than
6.5
million
acre-feet
out
of
the
main
river.
it
is
--
if
the
com--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
we
think
you're
right.
we
think
the
forecast
of
the
his
--
based
on
the
history
of
the
river
is
valid
evidence.
he
rejects
it
completely.
if
accepted,
it
would
show
that,
instead
of
having
6.5
million
acre-feet
available,
we
would
have
probably
less
than
six
in
view
of
the
latest
information
on
the
water
supply
of
the
river
system,
less
than
six.
the
most
we
can
claim
is
6.5
million
if
the
upper
basin
develops
beyond
its
present
level
of
about
four
million.
we
are
right
at
the
breaking
point.
we're
on
a
collision
course
with
the
upper
basin
as
of
this
moment.
any
expansion
in
the
upper
basin,
as
i'll
come
to
with
another
chart
in
a
moment,
will
bring
us
smacked
against
the
imposition
of
this
six-and-a
half
in
the
city.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
that
is
not
the
point,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
seven-and
--
the
75
million
acre-feet
at
lee
ferry,
the
iii
(d)
guarantee,
is
not
the
same
as
our
7.5
million
exceeding
on
lower
basin
iii
(a)
appropriations,
as
the
master
had
so
clearly
demonstrated.
our
7.5
million
encompasses
the
tributaries.
we
can
claim
all
of
the
main
river
only
5.5
million
under
iii
(a).
the
75
million
delivered
at
lee
ferry
must,
therefore
--
it
will
be
partly
used
up,
burned
up
by
channel
losses,
reservoir
losses
which
he
treats
as
a
diminution
of
supply,
not
a
consumptive
use,
between
lee
ferry
and
the
diversion
points
and,
more
important,
it
includes
the
upper
basin
share
of
the
mexican
treaty
burden
of
the
75
million
acre-feet
at
lee
ferry
required
by
article
iii
(d)
every
decade.
25
million
is
not
available
for
use
in
the
united
states.
the
reason
is
that
the
mexican
water
treaty
will
require
15
million
of
that
and
losses
--
unavoidable
losses
from
lee
ferry
to
mexico
are
some
10
million
acre-feet
per
decade
in
excess
of
the
tributary
inflow.
that
is
fundamental.
there
is
no
equation
between
the
75
million
iii
(d)
delivery
at
lee
ferry
and
our
ceiling
on
appropriation
of
7.5
million
for
two
basic
reasons.
the
7.5
million
encompasses
a
tributary
uses.
the
second
basic
reason
is
that
75
million
of
supply
at
lee
ferry
must
include
water
for
mexico
in
part
and
must
include
losses.
there
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
he
does,
your
honor,
and
they
are
at
--
on
page
125.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
your
honor.
his
figures
i
--
in
fairness
to
the
master,
i
must
say,
if
we
accepted
them,
the
si
--
our
situation
is
even
more
extreme
and
desperate.
the
figures
he
gives
for
losses,
we
think,
will
be
reduced
in
the
future.
if
we
used
his
figures,
the
situation
is
truly
catastrophic.
he
shows
evaporation
from
the
two
reservoirs
below
lake
mead.
these
are
lake
mohave
at
davis
dam
and
lake
havasu
at
parker
dam.
the
two
of
them
combined,
they
burn
up
about
300,000
acre-feet
a
year
in
evaporation
loss,
nothing
you
can
do
about
it.
channel
losses
between
hoover
dam
--
hoover
dam
and
the
international
boundary
are
shown
there
below
that
and,
as
you
will
see,
they
have
averaged,
for
the
two
periods
you
give,
something
of
the
order
of
a
million
acre-feet.
now,
in
addition,
there
are
losses
between
lee
ferry
and
lake
mead.
they
are
just
about
offset
by
a
tributary
inflow
there,
but
if
you
add
up
the
losses
he
gives
on
page
125,
you
will
see
that
they
are
of
the
order
of
1,300,000
acre-feet
per
year.
and,
there's
no
substantial
tributary
inflow
of
the
gila
as
fully
appropriated
and
the
little
bill
williams
river
doesn't
produce
much.
that's
the
only
truth.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
upper
basin
is
entitled
to
put
to
use
water
up
to
the
ceiling
on
appropriations,
in
the
master's
expression,
imposed
by
the
colorado
river
compact.
that
ceiling
on
appropriations
is
a
ceiling
which
will
come
into
operation
when
the
upper
basin
is
faced
with
the
necessity
of
delivering
75
million
acre-feet
of
water
at
lee
ferry
plus
perhaps
part
of
the
mexican
burden,
another
problem,
and
the
residue
may
or
may
not
be
7.5
million
or
six
million
or
five
million.
they
can
use
only
so
much
water
as
does
not
interfere
with
the
prime
mortgages
that
the
compact
has
imposed
upon
them,
(a)
the
mexican
water
treaty,
(b)
the
article
iii
(d)
delivery
requirement
of
lee
ferry.
when
we
were
before
you
on
the
adjoining
argument,
mr.
justice
black,
all
of
us
at
that
time
were
raising
our
argument
on
pleadings
which
treated
the
apportionment
to
the
upper
basin
as
7.5
acre-feet.
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
water
supply
evidence
in
this
case
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
upper
basin
to
ever
use
7.5
million
acre-feet
and
honor
its
iii
(d)
obligation.
if
that
evidence
were
not
here--if
that
evidence
were
not
here,
the
master's
interpretation,
nevertheless
of
the
compact
as
imposing
reciprocal
ceilings
on
appropriations,
means
that
the
upper
basin
does
not
have
an
apportionment
or
title
or
patent
or
grant
of
7.5
million
acre-feet.
it
has
a
ceiling
imposed
upon
it
which
will
come
into
operation
long
before
it
ever
uses
seven-and-a
half
million.
that
ceiling
is
the
one
invoked
to
permit
or
make
possible
the
flow
of
75
million
acre-feet
at
lee
ferry.
mr.
northcutt
ely
not
--
not
necessarily.
we
don't
--
well,
it
may,
your
honor,
but
we
do
not
differ
from
the
master's
approach
in
that
respect.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
your
honor.
the
effect
on
the
upper
basin
is
not
dependent
at
all
upon
your
adoption
of
our
view
of
the
proper
allocation
on
the
lower
basin
or
the
master's
view
of
it.
in
either
event,
we
both
go
on
the
assumption
that
the
article
iii
(d)
limitation
or
guarantee
is
going
to
be
enforced
and
it
is
that
which
will
make
impossible
the
full
utilization
of
their
use
in
the
upper
basin.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
you
divide
up
the
water
in
the
lower
basin.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
your
honor,
there
are
two
problems.
one,
shall
the
colorado
river
compact
be
treated
as
a
--
as
truly
a
covenant
among
these
states
in
operating,
intended
to
be
enforced,
and
did
congress
pass
the
project
act
and
require
the
limitation
of
california
in
the
expectation
that
it
would
be
enforced
or
shall
it
be
treated
as
a
scrap
of
paper?
we
don't
know
whether
the
upper
basin
will
ever
develop.
we
don't
know
what
the
water
supply
will
be
in
the
compact.
it's,
hence,
irrelevant,
as
the
master
believes.
now,
as
i
will
indicate
when
i
come
to
the
third
point
of
my
argument,
justiciability
in
water
supply,
the
physical
flow
at
lee
ferry
has
always
been
of
the
order
for
any
period
you
want
to
take,
10
years,
20,
30,
40,
any
long
period
has
always
been
of
the
order
of
eleven-and-a
half
million
acre-feet
or
more.
the
maximum
claims
of
arizona,
california,
and
nevada,
added
to
their
mexican
requirements,
added
to
all
losses
are
less
than
11.5
million
acre-feet.
they
don't
have
a
shortage
now.
there's
no
occasion
for
a
cross
word
between
arizona
and
california,
truly,
but
for
the
existence
of
the
colorado
river
compact
and
the
fact
that
the
compact
entitles
the
upper
basin
to
enforce
against
all
three
of
us
a
ceiling
on
appropriations
and,
hence,
reduces
the
supply
below
the
claims
and
creates
a
justiciable
controversy.
if
the
colorado
river
compact
didn't
exist,
there'd
be
no
justiciable
controversy
here
because,
in
that
event,
the
rights
of
state
versus
state,
basin
versus
basin,
would
be
controlled
by
the
law,
the
rule
this
court
has
developed
of
equitable
apportionment,
priority
of
appropriation
as
a
primary
consideration.
the
arizona
appropriations,
and
ours,
and
nevada's
are
all
senior
to
a
new
undreamed
of
projects
in
the
upper
basin.
we
wouldn't
be
before
you.
the
quarrel
would
come
someday
when
the
upper
basin
states
endeavor
to
bring
forward
these
junior
projects
and
collide
it
with
arizona,
california,
nevada
senior
projects.
we're
here,
today,
only
because
the
colorado
river
compact
exists.
what
meaning
shall
be
given
to
it?
does
it
or
does
it
not
impose
upon
the
lower
basin
states
a
ceiling
on
their
appropriations?
if
it
doesn't,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
arizona.
this
case
is
not
justiciable.
if
the
compact,
however,
is
given
effect,
then
the
ceiling
on
our
appropriations
in
the
lower
basin
from
the
main
river
is
6.5
million
acre-feet.
the
master's
requirement
would
give
us
3,800,000
acre-feet
for
california,
which
is
800,000
acre-feet
less
than
our
existing
uses
at
the
time
of
trial.
some
of
our
projects
are
going
to
be
destroyed.
it
happens
to
be
the
metropolitan
water
district.
but
we'd
be
just
as
disturbed
about
it,
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
california,
if
it
were
palo
verde
or
all-american,
or
any
other.
you
don't
destroy
existing
uses,
existing
projects
to
build
a
new
one
under
any
law
this
court
has
devised
heretofore.
you're
only
driven
to
that
if
the
colorado
river
compact
has
restricted
the
supply
available
to
these
three
states
and
has
given
some
effect
and
if
you
construe
the
limitation
on
california,
although
it
is
terms
of
the
same
colorado
river
compact,
article
iii
(a)
as
being
an
inappropriate
reference.
somehow,
the
resource
of
supply
is
limited
by
the
compact
but
we're
told
to
divide
it
up
on
a
formula
which,
although
it
uses
compact
terms,
did
so
inappropriately.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
think
exactly
so.
yes,
we
want
to
do
that.
we
--
we
will
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir,
and
i
will
develop
that.
in
this
legislative
environment,
the
limitation
has
to
mean
the
same
thing
that
the
compact
means.
these
--
the
upper
states
couldn't
get
a
seven-state
compact
because
arizona
rejected
it.
the
next
best
thing
was
a
six-state
compact
accompanied
by
a
limitation
enacted
by
california.
you
can't
accomplish
the
purpose
of
a
seven-state
compact
by
the
substitute
device
of
a
six-state
compact
that
had
collateral
agreement
by
california,
unless
a
collateral
agreement
by
a
california
written
in
compact
terms
means
the
same
things
as
those
same
terms
in
the
compact
itself.
this
--
this
problem
can
be
simplified
in
this
way.
so
far
as
the
limitation
issue
is
concerned,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
priority
issue
now,
the
limitation
issue,
does
the
limitation
act,
when
it
says
“compact”
mean
compact?
it's
just
that
simple,
just
that
simple.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
you're
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
master's
report
reduces
this
great
controversy,
this
dispute
over
the
destinies
of
these
states
to
a
problem
of
parsing
sentences
in
the
statute.
it's
not
that
simple,
it's
not
that
simple.
we
have
involved
here
the
history
of
four
decades
of
interpretation
controversy
over
the
meeting
of
the
colorado
river
compact
and,
in
fact,
i
analogize
it
in
this
way.
with
respect
to
the
limitation
issue,
we're
somewhat
like
five
partners
who
are
attempting
to
draw
drafts
against
the
bank
account
in
a
bank
that
has
country
branches,
the
tributaries,
and
there's
7.5
million
dollars
involved
that
we
can
draw
drafts
against.
california
has
made
an
agreement.
we
will
not
draft
more
than
$4,400,000
against
that
total
account
in
the
main
office
and
all
the
branches.
and,
that
leaves
a
residue
of
$3,100,000
we're
precluded
from.
our
partners
go
to
the
branch
banks
and
cash
drafts
for
$2,000,000,
that's
the
tributary
banks.
and
then,
they
come
to
the
main
office
and
say
“here's
our
draft
for
$3,100,000.”
we
say
"you
can't
do
that.
you've
already
drawn
$2,000,000
out
of
the
country
banks."
they
say
“no,
this
reference
to
the
country
banks
is
inappropriate.
you
just
give
us
this
$3,100,000,
out
of
the
main
office
and
we
will
keep
the
$2,200,000."
and,
california
says
“you
can't
do
that.
we
got
a
claim
for
$4,
400,000.
there's
only
$5,500,000
on
deposit
at
the
main
office."
and
then,
the
master
says,
“well,
that
being
so,
we'll
prorate
and
see,”
and
they'll
prorate.
our
draft
is
good.
this
is
our
agreement.
now,
to
come
to
this
question
of
priorities,
what
do
you
do
when
you
don't
have
the
resource
to
pay?
and
before
i
do
that,
let
me
say
i'll
analogize
this
in
another
way.
we're
like
people
who
quarrel
for
30
years
over
a
contract
that
says
it's
governed
by
the
laws
on
new
york,
incorporates
a
new
york
statute
by
specific
reference.
it's
article
iii
(a)
of
some
new
york
statute.
and,
after
the
trial
is
all
over,
all
argued,
all
briefed
after
three
years,
the
decision
comes
down
from
the
master.
“the
reference
in
your
contract
to
the
laws
of
new
york
was
inappropriate.
it
should
have
said
north
dakota.”
now,
that's
a
little
late
and
he
is
very
candid
about
this.
in
oral
argument
in
new
york,
when
they
called
this
to
his
attention
and
said,
“nobody
--
nobody
in
30
years
has
ever
suggested,
has
ever
litigated
the
idea
that
the
limitation,
when
it
says
paragraph
(a)
or
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact
doesn't
mean
that,
it
means
the
red
water
from
lake
mead
down,
it
doesn't
mean
the
system.”
nobody's
ever
suggested
that.
they
only
said,
“i
agree
with
you.”
but
if
this
were
--
if
this
were
a
patent
case,
i'd
claim
novelty
on
it.
well,
novelty
in
a
patent
case
may
be
a
very
good
idea
but
it's
not
a
good
way
to
offset
a
rule
properly.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
of
course
you're
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
what
i
am
attempting
to
say
is
that
this
has
become
a
rule
of
property
through
four
previous
--
three
previous
decisions
of
this
court.
administrative
actions,
investment
of
$600
million
in
the
california
projects,
you
don't
likely
offset
all
that
by
a
patent
or
novelty.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
wasn't
litigated
there.
that's
my
point.
nobody
made
this
issue.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
wasn't
before
this
court
on
the
joint
of
motion.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
mean
that.
i
mean
to
say
that
you
don't
offset
the
--
by
the
parsing
of
--
by
the
parsing
of
sentences,
you
don't
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
exactly
so,
and
i'm
saying
that
even
if
his
interpretation
might
have
had
basis,
as
of
june
25,
1929,
president
hoover
had
proclaimed
this
to
be
interpretation
or,
on
december
21,
1928,
president
coolidge
had.
then,
we
would
have
had
a
clean
slate.we
could
have
decided
do
we
or
don't
we
take
the
gamble
on
this?
do
we
or
do
we
not
build
a
metropolitan
aqueduct
that
cost
$600
million
based
upon
the
expectation
of
no
water
at
all
for
it
if
the
compact
is
ever
invoked?
that
wasn't
the
gamble
we
took
at
all.
mr.
northcutt
ely
you're
right.
i'll
read
you
a
little
later
from
what
he
does
say
on
that.
it's
appalling.
all
it
really
is
an
assumption
of
abundance
into
the
future.
now,
the
priority
issue,
i've
been
on
the
edge
of
that
for
a
while.
the
priority
issue
is
simply
this.
if
there
is
not
enough
water
to
satisfy
the
7.5
million
acre-feet
within
the
iii
(a)
apportionment
from
lake
mead
down,
the
master's
mainstream,
you
have
a
--
not
mead
again.
if
we
don't
have
within
the
red
area
on
this
--
on
this
map
7.5
million
acre-feet
to
satisfy
the
claims
within
the
iii
(a)
apportionment,
what
do
you
do
about
it?
the
master
says
we
are
going
to
prorate.california
shall
have
44/75
of
whatever
is
there.
arizona
28/75,
nevada,
3/75.
the
44/75
for
california
he
gets
out
of
his
interpretation
of
the
limitation,
which
i
have
read
to
you.
we
would
have
had
4,400,000.
if
7.5
million
were
there,
he's
going
give
us
44/75.
the
shares
for
arizona
and
nevada
are
2,800,000
and
300,000.
he
gets
that
--
those
out
of
contracts
which
the
secretary
of
interior
made
in
1944
with
those
two
states.
i'm
going
to
postpone
discussion
of
that
until
i
reach
it
in
the
chronological
order
but,
for
the
moment
--
for
the
moment,
i
shall
simply
say
that
the
master
proposes
to
prorate
the
quantity
available.
now,
that
is
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
the
projects
affected
in
california
are
built
existing
--
using
water
more
than
4,400,000
acre-feet.
the
projects
in
arizona
that,
on
the
same
proration
schedule
of
28/75,
would
get
something
like
2,240,000
acre-feet
--
2,400,000,
excuse
me
--
2,400,000
would
go
to
arizona.
all
of
their
existing
projects,
when
fully
developed,
will
use
about
1,100,000
--
1,200,000.
water
will,
thus,
be
set
aside
for
expansion
in
arizona
to
the
extent
of
about
1,200,000.
in
other
words,
about
double
the
requirements
of
their
existing
projects.
as
to
nevada,
the
result
percentage-wise
is
more
extreme
because
they're
using
very
little.
california
says
that,
in
the
event
of
shortage,
it
should
be
borne
by
application
of
the
rules
this
court
has
developed
in
its
equitable
apportionment
cases.
their
priority
of
appropriation
is
a
guiding
principle,
modified
by
the
rule
that
you
do
not
destroy
existing
uses.
we
rely
upon
both
legs
--
both
legs
of
the
equitable
apportionment
rule
as
developed
here.
our
priorities
are
senior.
our
uses
are
in
existence.
never
before
has
this
court
abrogated
the
rule
of
priority
of
appropriation,
destroy
its
existing
uses
to
set
aside
water
for
future
use
by
projects
which,
in
the
master's
expression,
may
never
come
into
existence
except
by
acts
of
congress
hereafter.
now,
we
say
that
if
he's
right
about
that,
if
the
shortage
depends
upon
the
enactment
of
statutes
hereafter
to
authorize
new
projects,
then
maybe
we're
litigating
the
wrong
statute
and
doing
so
prematurely
because
if
the
harm
is
going
to
be
occasion
not
by
what's
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
but
by
what
act
x
by
a
senator
whose
yet
to
un-elect
it
says,
"then
we
are
here
before
you
prematurely
because
if
the
new
statute
that
authorizes
the
new
project
says
on
its
face,
this
is
without
prejudice
and
subject
to
the
priorities
of
projects
now
in
existence,
we
have
no
quarrel
to
that
sort
of
a
statue.”
if
the
new
project
will
take
that
risk,
as
attorney
general
mosk
told
you,
our
quarrel
is
with
the
fact
the
risk
is
thrown
upon
our
existing
projects
and
that's
not
right.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
latter,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
think,
your
honor,
the
answer
--
i
think
the
answer
is
--
the
answer
is
no.
i
believe
that,
truly,
i
must
give
you
that
answer
but
that
isn't
quite
our
situation.
the
trouble
is
that
the
master
decided
the
case
was
never
litigated,
never
pleaded,
never
at
issue.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right,
sir.
had
they
heightened
this,
i'd
put
it
in
a
nutshell.
had
arizona's
bill
of
complaint
tendered
here
in
1952,
which
california
respond,
“we
have
no
objection
to
the
filling
of
this
bill.
we
want
this
controversy
decided.
that
is
our
response.”
had
the
arizona
bill
of
complaint
then
tendered
said
on
its
face
what
the
master's
report
now
says,
that
complaint
would
have
read
something
like
this,
“arizona
desires
a
determination
of
the
availability
of
water
supply
for
its
proposed
central
arizona
project.”
we
have
not
made
up
our
minds
where
we're
going
to
divert,
whether
above
hoover
dam
or
below.
we
are
next
to
a
bill
of
complaint
on
map
which
shows
the
three
routes
were
now
considering.
two
of
them
are
shown
in
blue
on
the
map
behind
me
and
in
front
of
you,
map
a
or
map
b,
either
one.
the
third
is
shown
in
red
below
hoover
dam.
we
desire
a
decree
that
will
say
that
if
we
divert
below
hoover
dam,
the
diversion
from
the
central
arizona
project
with
about
1,200,000
acre-feet
is
to
be
encompassed
by
the
decree
and
charged
against
the
2,800,000
acre-feet
we
want.
but
if
we
decide
to
build
this
above
hoover
dam
to
divert
from
rich
canyon
or
marvel
canyon,
the
two
routes,
i
may
interject,
that
are
now
under
active
investigation,
then
that
water
is
to
be
in
addition
to
the
decreed
water
and
not
encompassed
within
it.
that
is
what
the
master's
proposed
decision
says.
now,
if
that
bill
of
complaint
had
said
that
and
had
gone
on
in
paragraph
two
to
say
what
the
master
says
that
there
is
no
indication
of
shortage
for
california's
projects
or
for
ours,
including
our
proposed
central
arizona
project,
unless
and
until
congress
authorizes
vast
new
projects,
some
of
which
are
as
yet
unformulated
in
the
upper
basin,
then
had
gone
on
to
say
that,
“we
desire
a
construction
of
the
limitation
which
shall
say
that
the
references
to
the
colorado
river
compact
were
inappropriate
and
we
want
a
pro
rata
wiping
out
california
priorities
for
your
existing
projects."
point
one,
do
you
think
we
would
have
acquiesced
in
the
filing
of
such
a
bill
with
a
method
of
threshold,
as
the
three
earlier
suits
were
met,
by
opposition
to
the
filing
of
such
bill
and,
second,
i
don't
think
this
court
would
ever
permit
it
to
be
filed.
it
shows
on
its
face
a
non-justiciable
controversy,
one
that
says
that
the
colorado
river
compact
may
or
may
not
ever
be
invoked.
it's
irrelevant.
the
pleadings
that
came
here
presented
precisely
the
opposite
issue.
you
may
recall
arizona
tendered
three
issues.
they
all
involved
the
colorado
river
compact.
what
she
said
was
that
the
california
limitation
act
imposes
on
california
a
limitation
written
in
terms
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
there
is
a
dispute
between
us
--
a
dispute
between
us
as
to
whether
the
beneficial
consumptive
use
chargeable
to
arizona
shall
be
reckoned
by
diversions
less
returns,
as
california
says
and
as
the
master
holds,
or
on
some
basis
more
favorable
to
arizona.
they
call
it
"depletion
theory."
i
won't
go
into
that.
and,
second,
what
do
you
do
about
reservoir
evaporation
losses?
are
they
treated
as
a
consumptive
use
chargeable
within
the
compact,
chargeable
within
the
limitation
act?
the
master
says,
"no,
they're
not.
they're
a
depletion
of
--
diminution
of
supply."
and,
third,
arizona's
pleading
said,
"is
california
precluded
from
the
million
acre-feet
of
so-called
iii
(b)
water?"
master
decides
that
for
us,
too,
"no,
we're
not
precluded.
we
can
share
in
it."
the
three
issues
tendered
were
those
upon
which
we
took
a
calculated
risk
in
building
our
projects
and
we
won
all
three
of
them.
we're
glad
to
have
those
litigated
and
decided,
but
we'll
lose
this
case
here
because
the
master
decides
it
upon
an
issue
never
tendered.
had
it
been
tendered,
it
would've
been
within
the
compass
of
a
complaint
which
on
its
face,
we
think,
would
have
shown
a
non-justiciable
controversy.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
substantially
so,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
i
would
say
so,
your
honor,
because
she
alleged
that
the
claims
of
the
two
states
were
mutually
exclusive.
the
premise
of
the
master
truly
is
that
they
are
not
mutually
exclusive
because
you
won't
know
until
new
projects
were
authorized
in
the
upper
basin,
vast
new
projects,
where
there
may
not
be
water
enough
for
everybody.
if
this
were
--
the
dispute
would
involve
the
mississippi
river
and
were
a
controversy
between
new
orleans
and
memphis,
you
wouldn't
care
what
their
formula
was.
there'd
be
so
much
water,
you
just
wouldn't
care.
you
--
it's
the
fact
that
the
formulas
applied
against
a
water
supply
that
either
is
or
is
not
limited
by
the
colorado
river
compact
that
brings
us
here.
the
master
says,
"it's
not."
if
not,
then
why
are
we
here?
mr.
northcutt
ely
or
even
a
major
fraction
of
it,
yes,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
or
even
a
major
fraction
of
it,
yes,
sir.
may
i
have
--
let
me
come
to
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
if
the
upper
basin
honors
its
iii
(d)
minimum
commitment,
which
of
course
it
will,
then
that
is
a
--
that
is
the
reason
why
the
upper
basin
cannot
expand
very
much.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no.
i
have
not
made
myself
clear.
let
me
come
to
grips
with
that.
may
i
have
chart
3?
mr.
northcutt
ely
in
part,
that
is
a
very
important
part
of
our
contention.
the
other
is
that
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
other
is
that
arizona
is
accountable,
chargeable
for
her
uses
upon
the
tributaries,
the
gila
primarily.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
limitation
act
excludes
us
from
3,100,000
acre-feet
of
the
waters
referred
to
in
paragraph
(a)
of
article
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
it
includes
--
our
problem
includes
the
gila
which
comes
in
below
and
the
gila
is
the
greatest
of
the
items
involved
in
the
equation.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it's
--
it's
this,
your
honor.
we're
precluded
from
3,100,000
acre-feet
of
the
waters
referred
to
in
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii.
we've
agreed
to
that.
can
3,100,000
acre-feet
be
claimed
in
its
entirety
from
the
stretch
of
the
river
from
lake
mead
to
mexico,
the
area
in
red
on
the
maps
before
you,
or
may
it
be
claimed
instead
from
the
area
in
red
plus
the
tributaries
shown
in
blue?
we
say
the
latter.
if
we
we're
right,
then
some-two
million
acre-feet
of
that
3,100,000
is
accounted
for
by
those
tributary
uses
not
over
1,100,000
maybe
acclaimed
within
article
iii
(a)
from
the
main
river,
the
red
area,
by
arizona
and
nevada.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no
sir.
it
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
will
try
to.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i'll
try
to
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
i'll
try
to
do
it
both
ways.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i'll
--
i
will
try.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
don't
have
any
reference
to
any
quarrel
with
the
upper
basin
in
either
event,
but
we
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
i'll
--
i
will
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
difference
in
the
two
questions
of
which
i'm
confronted,
but
i'll
do
my
best
to
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
to
sort
them
out.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
i'll
try,
i'll
try.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
but
not
in
consequence
of
any
division
you
may
make
between
arizona,
california
and
nevada.
it's
in
consequence
of
article
iii
(d)'s
guarantee
of
75
million
every
10
years
and
a
consequence
of
the
obligation
assumed
in
article
3
(c)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
of
the
compact.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
how
you
decide
arizona
versus
california.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
we
don't
ask
you
to
decide
what
the
upper
basin
is
entitled
to
receive.
mr.
northcutt
ely
or
to
keep.
what
we
do
say,
your
honor,
is
that
a
simple
mathematical
subtraction
will
show
you
that
the
master
is
unfortunately
wrong
in
his
optimistic
assurance
of
plenty
to
us.
if
i
may
have
your
attention
to
this
chart
behind
me,
the
line
one
--
first
of
all,
this
chart
is
--
shows
the
upper
basin
depletion
which
would
not
impair
the
lower
basin
mainstream
supply
of
7.5
million
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use.
this
is
the
master's
premise
that
there
is
nothing
to
indicate,
for
the
foreseeable
or
the
unforeseeable
future,
developments
in
the
upper
basin
that
will
reduce
the
lower
basin
below
7.5
million
acre-feet
in
the
red
segment
of
the
river.
this
table
is
in
millions
of
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
per
year.
the
first
column
gives
descriptions.
the
second
column
is
captured
in
maximum
of
a
48-year
period,
1909
to
1956,
the
next
column,
minimum
of
27-year
period,
1930
to
1956.
now,
let
me
explain
these
captions
first.
if
you'll
turn
to
page
118
of
the
master's
report,
you'll
find
tabulated
there
the
so-called
undepleted
or
virgin
flow
of
the
colorado
river
at
lee
ferry.
this
is
a
term
devised
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
it
is
a
calculation
by
the
bureau
and
published
by
the
united
states
geological
survey
of
the
quantity
of
water
which
would
have
been
flowing
at
lee
ferry
in
each
of
these
years
had
there
been
no
upper
basin
depletions
whatever.
this
does
not
say
that
the
flow
of
the
river
in
1792,
the
virgin
undepleted
flow
would
be
such
and
such.
it's
a
calculation
of
how
much
would've
been
there
in
the
year
1951
had
there
been
no
upper
basin
depletions.
now,
this
method
of
calculation
was
developed
in
the
trial.
it's
used
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
these
figures
are
accepted
by
all
of
us.
i
don't
tell
you
that
you
can
--
anybody
can
perform
this
calculation
to
a
precision.
it's
arizona's
evidence.
we
don't
--
we
use
it
all
as
a
working
tool.
now,
the
master
shows
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
the
averages
for
poor
selected
periods.
the
greatest
of
these
is
the
figure
15,211,000
acre-feet
for
the
period
of
1909
to
1956.
mr.
northcutt
ely
page
118,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yeah,
118.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
largest
of
these
is
the
figure
15,211,000
acre-feet
per
year.
this
is
flow,
not
consumptive
use,
for
the
period
1909
to
1956.
if
you
select
any
other
period,
you
are
dealing
with
a
smaller
resource.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
in
the
--
they
do
not
install
gauges
at
lee
ferry
until
1922.
before
that
time,
all
of
the
flows
rest
in
us.
and,
before
that
time,
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
estimate,
yes,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
they
are
estimates
and
the
figures
are
inflated
by
the
fact
that
in
those
estimates
appear
some
tremendous
floods
which
are
ga
--
estimated
only
by
the
height
the
river
rose
by
leaving
debris
on
the
canyons.
any
figures
before
19
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that's
right
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
1909,
1912,
1914,
1917.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no.
to
pose
error,
you
may
remember
wyoming
versus
colorado.
the
court
threw
out
the
evidence
of
the
four
biggest
years.
it
said
it
wasn't
going
to
depend
on
them.
if
you
did
that
here,
you
would
throw
out
these
tremendous
flood
years
for
two
reasons,
one,
because
nobody
knows
that
these
floods
really
happened
and,
second,
because
if
they
did
happen,
the
flood
is
so
tremendous,
it's
beyond
the
capacity
of
any
reservoir
to
fully
save
and
equate.
you're
going
to
lose
part
of
it
by
a
spill
to
mexico.
anyhow,
the
total
resource,
the
whole
universe,
is
shown
in
the
four
lines
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
if
you're
optimistic,
if
you
believe
that
the
flows
of
1909
are
really
going
to
come
again
or
1917,
and
that
you're
going
to
have
reservoirs
big
enough
and
empty
enough
to
catch
them
and
save
them
and
use
them
then,
in
that
event,
assume
a
virgin
flow
of
15,200,00
acre-feet
as
being
your
resource.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
you
--
you're
cautious,
take
the
period
that
began
with
the
period
you
selected
in
nebraska
versus
wyoming,
1903,
and
i
--
in
that
event,
you'd
have
13,085,000.
that's
the
whole
resource
if
neither
basin
--
i
mean,
if
the
upper
basin
was
not
using
a
singled
drop.
now,
if
you're
still
more
pessimistic,
you
wouldn't
use
any
of
these
four
figures.
you'd
use
the
one
from
1931
to
1940.
that's
the
period
by
coincidence.
that
was
the
limiting
drought
period
in
nebraska
versus
wyoming
and,
in
that
event,
you'd
be
down
to
less
than
12
million,
about
11.5
million.
now,
if
you'll
turn
to
my
chart,
under
the
maximum
column,
we
have
started
with
the
most
hopeful
of
these
figures,
15,200,000
acre-feet
per
year
of
undepleted
or
virgin
flow,
from
page
118
of
the
master's
report.
and,
under
the
minimum
per
--
column,
we
have
taken
the
least
optimistic
that
for
1930
to
1956,
13,100,000.
now,
in
line
two,
we
have
subtracted
the
two
figures
that
must
be
subtracted
to
determine
what
residue
the
upper
basin
can
actually
use
consistently
with
the
iii
(d)
requirement.
if
the
master
is
right,
the
7.5
million
acre-feet
can
--
is
going
to
be
consumed
from
the
red
segment
of
the
river
and
if
mexico
is
going
to
get
its
2.5
--
its
1.5
million
acre-feet,
and
if
this
million
acre-feet
of
losses
is
going
to
be
met,
then
there
must
flow
at
lee
ferry
every
year
a
constant
or
an
average
at
least
of
10
million
acre-feet.
now,
if
you
subtract
that
obligation
and
decide
what
the
residue
the
upper
basin
has
for
itself,
line
three
shows
it.
if
you're
dealing
on
the
hopeful
basis
of
the
maximum
resource,
15,200,000
acre-feet
of
virgin
flow,
then
the
upper
basin
would
have
left
5,200,000.
if
you're
dealing
with
a
more
pessimistic
assumption
of
virgin
flow,
the
upper
basin
would
have
left
3,100,000.
now,
let
me
pause
there.
those
are
the
figures
that
i
am
talking
about,
not
7.5
million
apportioned
to
the
upper
basin.
line
four
shows
for
you
the
existing
and
authorized
upper
basin
depletions.
those
are
in
evidence.
those
are
--
a
report
from
the
united
states
bureau
of
reclamation
to
the
committees
of
congress.
as
to
the
depletions
to
be
occasioned
by
projects
already
authorized
or
already
in
existence
in
the
upper
basin,
you
can't
do
anything
about
that.
that
is
water
literally
over
the
dam.
that
is
3,900,000
acre-feet.
subtract
that
and
line
five
shows
you
the
margin
remaining
for
upper
basin
depletions
if
the
lower
basin
is
to
have
from
the
red
segment
of
the
river
7.5
million
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use.
mr.
northcutt
ely
precisely.
that
is
right.
they
cannot
expand
more
than
1,300,000
acre-feet
above
their
present
authorizations
and
the
bureau
of
reclamation
has
also
projected
the
date
at
which
the
million
hundred
--
1,300,000
acre-feet
will
be
put
to
use
and
it's
within
a
few
decades,
about
the
length
of
time
since
the
compact
was
signed.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no.
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
if
the
--
i'd
put
it
the
other
way
around
that
it
would
be
breaking
all
precedent
that
you
established
in
the
nebraska
versus
wyoming
and
wyoming
versus
colorado
where
you
did
examine
water
supply
so
carefully
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
nothing
can
happen
here
to
interfere
with
the
prospect
of
abundance.
of
course
it
can
happen
here.
the
colorado
river
compact
is
looking
us
in
the
eye
and
you
cannot
assume
that
the
upper
basin
is
going
to
fold
its
hands
and
say
“we
quit.”
we
have
an
apportionment
of
perpetuity,
it
says
here,
seven-and-a
half
million
but
we're
content
with
3,900,000
now
on
the
books.
of
course
not,
bills
are
pending
in
congress
at
this
moment
to
increase
that.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
they
are,
your
honor,
and
this
is
the
reason.
the
117
table
is
captioned
"historic
flow
of
the
colorado
river
at
lee
ferry,”
the
emphasis
toward
“historic
flow.”
that
is
the
measured
flow
since
1922,
the
estimated
flow
prior
to
that
time.
that
is
what
in
fact
was
there.
118
is
the
calculation
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation
engineers
as
to
what
would
have
been
there
if
there
had
been
no
upper
basin
depletions
at
all.
it
is
called
the
undepleted
or
virgin
flow.
the
total
upper
basin
depletions
are
of
the
general
order
of
two
million
within
the
period
covered
by
these
two
tables.
it's
of
the
general
order
of
two
million
acre-feet
if
you
--
excuse
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
you
--
and
that
represents,
in
general,
a
magnitude
of
the
difference
between
them
not
year
by
year
but
on
average.
mr.
northcutt
ely
1922,
your
honor.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
would
be,
your
honor.
let
me
be
clear
on
that.
it
should
be
different
for
every
year.
by
historic
flow,
perhaps
that's
the
wrong
word
for
it,
i
don't
mean
by
that
measured
flow,
i
mean
that
the
physical
flow
actually
there
with
the
measure
estimated.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
they
didn't,
no.
the
--
let
me
just
take
this
up
from
1922
on.
the
equation
is
simply
this
that
the
historic
flow
on
page
108
--
117
plus
the
upstream
depletions,
more
or
less
two
million,
should
equal
the
virgin
flow
shown
on
page
118.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right.
that
is
exactly
so.
you
take
the
historic
flow
shown
at
page
117.
that
sh
--
the
gauges
show
it
went
through
there.
add
to
it
the
depletions
to
arrive
at
the
figure
shown
on
page
118.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
it's
a
hypothetical
figure.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
it's
imaginary.
mr.
northcutt
ely
exactly
so.
and,
it's
a
concept
everyone
has
difficulty
in
accepting
but
that's
the
tool
that
we
work
with.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
that's
the,
imaginary
perhaps
is
the
wrong
word,
hypothetical
flow.
you
want
--
you
know
as
a
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
we
have
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
we've
had
the
same
trouble
we
pursued
there
as
on
the
witnesses
on
this
subject
but,
in
fairness,
what
it
comes
down
to
is
simply
this.
that
if
you
--
if
you
wanted
to
know
how
much
water
was
flowing
to
great
falls
above
the
--
in
the
platonic
here,
you'd
go
up
and
measure.
but
if
you
wanted
to
know
how
much
water
would
be
flowing
there
if
no
diversions
have
been
made
upstream
by
any
community
above,
then
you'd
have
to
find
out
what
those
diversions
were
and
add
them
back
in.
that's
the
difference.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that's
right.
oh
yes,
it's
not
--
i
used
wrong
word,
imaginary.
mr.
northcutt
ely
as
you
can
calculate
for
the
reasonable
accuracy
of
the
upstream
depletions,
you
can
go
there
and
measure
it
and
you
add
it
into
the
historic
flow
at
lee
ferry
and
you
have
the
sum
is
equal
to
what
would
have
been
the
undepleted
flow
or
the
virgin
flow.
mr.
northcutt
ely
oh
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it's
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
it
is
an
engineering
equation
but
you're
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
my
--
the
thrust
of
my
argument
is
simply
to
answer
the
master's
reassurance
to
us,
there's
no
possibility
of
shortage,
the
compact
is
irrelevant.
you're
concerned
what
congress
does
here
after,
i
don't
know,
it
may
never
build
this
project.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
that
is
right.
it
can
never
--
it
can
never
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
that's
right.
and
that's
the
thrust
of
this
table
that
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon?
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
one
final
figure
which
is
in
the
red
on
the
chart
before
you
shows
that
if
you
assume
the
resource
is
only
the
undepleted
flow
of
1930
to
1956,
why,
armageddon
is
already
here.
the
upper
basin
can't
supply
3,900,000
acre-feet
of
projects
that's
already
built
or
is
building
now
by
--
to
the
extent
of
800,000
acre-feet
and
still
meet
its
iii
(d)
obligation
of
75
million
and
the
--
its
share
of
the
maximum
treaty
burden.
we're
busted
--
somebody's
busted
now.
mr.
northcutt
ely
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right,
yes,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we're
--
we
are
trying
to
meet
his
hypothesis
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
shortage
of
7.5
million
from
the
red
area,
the
mainstream,
from
lee
fer
--
from
lake
mead
to
mexico.
mr.
northcutt
ely
essentially
so,
i
--
probably,
if
i
thought
it
through,
i'd
hinge
a
little
but,
essentially,
that's
right.
mr.
northcutt
ely
by
other
parties,
you
mean
our
opponents?
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
certainly
hesitate
to
speak
for
our
opponent.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
the
arizona
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
--
i
am
certainly
get
in
trouble
if
i
do.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
no.
i'm
--
may
this
your
honor,
the
position
taken
in
arizona's
exceptions
is
that
the
colorado
river
compact
has
been
misconstrued
by
the
master.
it's
said,
imposes
a
greater
burden
on
the
upper
basin
and
we
say
it
does.
they
say
the
seven-and-a
half
million
of
iii
(a)
water,
the
million
of
iii
(b)
water
is
all
to
be
found
at
lee
ferry
and
the
compact
itself
excludes
all
the
tributaries.
we
don't
argue
with
it.
mr.
northcutt
ely
and,
if
that's
so,
then
the
figures
i
have
left
here
for
upper
basin
margins
would
have
to
be
shrunk
in
material.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
from
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well
the
--
if
the
mas
--
let
me
--
let
it
cross-grain
a
little
bit.
if
the
master
is
right
that
the
compact
is
irrelevant,
then
we
say
you
don't
have
any
justiciable
controversy
because
our
water
supply
is
unlimited.
the
historic
flow
has
exceeded
anything
we've
ever
asked.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
we
intend
to
abide
by
it,
but
when
i
say
the
--
where
the
supply
exceeds
the
demands,
i
am
taking
as
california's
demand,
the
demand
limited
by
the
limitation
agreement.
if
you
add
up
the
requirements
of
these
states,
california
limited
by
our
limitation
statute,
calif
--
arizona's
demand
for
2,800,000,
300,000
for
nevada,
you're
well
under
9
million
acre-feet.
add
in
mexico,
add
in
losses,
you're
well
under
11.5
million.
and,
the
historic
flow
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
exactly
so,
if
it
comes
down.
now,
the
historic
flow
upholds
--
on
page
117,
the
flow
that's
always
been
there
in
the
past
for
any
period
you
want
to
take
ending
in
1958,
whether
it's
10
years,
20,
30,
40,
roll
the
calendar
back
as
you
wish,
it
has
always
been
an
average
of
more
than
eleven-and-a
half
million
acre-feet.
we
have
no
quarrels
with
anybody.
it's
only
the
compact's
effect.
now,
then,
consequently,
i
don't
know
honestly
how
to
answer
your
question
as
to
the
impact
on
the
upper
basin.
if
the
compact
has
a
ceiling
on
our
appropriations,
then
they're
surely
going
to
invoke
it.
it
is
the
--
we're
in
a
state
of
euphoria
if
we
believe
otherwise.
look
at
this
chart.
they
can't
go
above
3,900,000
acre-feet.
they
can't
go
in
fact
above
3,100,000
if
we
have
water
for
the
future
like
we've
had
for
the
last
--
since
1930,
the
last
30
years.
are
they
going
to
throw
away
the
colorado
river
compact
that
they
imposed
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
27
times?
it's
written
into
that
act
27
times.
for
what
purpose?
are
they
going
to
throw
away
and
let
us
use,
as
the
master
thinks,
7.5
million
out
of
the
mainstream
instead
of
6.5?
they've
got
to
impose
it.
it's
unrealistic
to
assume
that
this
compact
is
a
scrap
of
paper
but
that
is
the
blinders
the
master
puts
on
this
case.
don't
look
at
the
compact,
it's
irrelevant.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
your
honor.
there
is
a
preliminary
question.
there
is
not
a
shortage
if
the
limitation
is
read
as
written,
that
the
reference
to
article
iii
(a)
of
the
compact
means
iii
(a)
of
the
main
river
and
the
tributaries
because
when
the
resources
of
the
tributaries
are
added
to
the
6.5
million
available
under
the
compact
in
the
main
river,
there's
no
shortage.
you
don't
reach
the
question
of
proration
versus
priority.
you'll
only
reach
it
if
you
adopt
the
master's
premise
that
these
two
are
to
be
severed
and
snipped
apart,
that
is
the
limitation
from
the
compact.
now,
before
i
--
on
that
very
point,
may
i
have
chart
2,
if
you
please.
this
chart's
caption,
“the
water
required
to
supply
california,
4.4
million
on
the
basis
of
proration,”
that's
the
master's
assumption,
“in
millions
or
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use.”
the
first
group
of
figures
is
--
the
head
of
the
--
if
the
compact
is
incorporated
in
the
limitation.
here,
as
you'll
see,
no
problem
of
shortage.
there
are
three
columns
of
figures,
one
shown
--
captioned
“mainstream,”
one
captioned
“tributaries,”
one
captioned,
“total.”
california
might
claim
4,400,000
acre-feet
from
the
mainstream,
nothing
from
the
tributaries,
we
have
none,
for
the
total
of
4,400,000
acre-feet.
the
other
lower
basin
states
might
claim
the
3,100,000
from
which
were
excluded,
in
the
last
column,
and
that
3,100,000
is
made
up
of
two
components,
1,100,000
from
the
mainstream
and
2,000,000
from
the
tributaries.
there's
no
shortage,
no
problems
involved.
there
is
in
the
mainstream
5,500,000
acre-feet
of
iii
(a)
water
available.
we
may
have
four,
for
the
other
states
1.1,
but
if
the
compact
is
excised
from
the
limitation,
then
you
reach
the
second
group
of
figures.
here,
look
at
the
last
column
first.
in
order
for
california
to
have
4,400,000
acre-feet,
there
must
be
9,500,000
acre-feet
available
in
the
main
river
plus
the
tributaries
because
the
other
states
on
the
master's
hypotheses
are
entitled
to
claim
5,100,000,
of
this,
two
million
on
the
tributaries,
3,100,000
from
the
main
river.
a
total
from
the
main
river
alone
is
7.5
million,
from
the
tributaries,
two
million,
a
total
of
9.5
million.
now,
that
is
one
million
in
excess
of
the
lower
basin's
ceiling
on
appropriations,
a
total
of
iii
(a)
plus
(b).
you
can't
find
under
the
proration
rule,
4,400,000
acre-feet
for
california
unless
the
lower
basin,
as
a
whole,
is
at
least
one
million
acre-feet
in
excess
of
its
iii
(a)
and
iii
(b)
ceilings.
the
problem
--
the
essential
on
the
limitation
issue
is
always
this,
can
the
other
states
claim
the
3,100,000,
which
we're
precluded,
from
the
red
river,
lake
mead
to
mexico
or
from
the
system,
the
main
river
plus
tributaries?
now,
on
this
matter
of
proration
versus
priorities,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
different
way
in
which
the
--
well,
first,
before
reach
that,
everything
i'm
going
to
say
on
priorities
relates
to
this
4,400,000
acre-foot
component
of
our
limitation.
in
the
reprint
before
you,
the
one
brought
back
is
number
one.
the
second
component,
one-half
of
the
excess
or
surplus,
i
don't
talk
about
in
terms
of
priority
at
all.
it
says
“one-half.”
one-half
means
one-half.
we
concede
that
the
effect
of
that
is
proration
not
because
it
says
so,
but
because
our
priorities
in
fact
exceed
one-half
and
we're
cut
back
to
it.
on
the
priority
issue,
i'm
talking
about
the
4,400,000
acre-feet,
the
first
component.
here's
what
the
master
does
with
respect
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
only
comes
into
the
case
in
the
event
that
you
agree
with
the
master
that
the
3,100,000
acre-feet
can
be
claimed
from
the
red
segment
instead
of
the
system.
it
depends
on
your
deciding
the
limitation
issue
against
us
and
as
you've
decided
it.
if
you
decide
the
limitation
issue
with
us,
you
do
not
reach
the
priority
question.
now,
on
the
question
of
priorities,
the
basic
rule
which
has
been
--
may
i
have
the
map
again,
the
map
a
please.
the
basic
rule
which
would
be
applicable
throughout
the
colorado
river
basin
in
the
absence
of
the
colorado
river
compact
and
the
absence
of
the
project
act
and
the
absent
limitation
act
is
unquestionably
the
rule
of
equitable
apportionment
interstate,
but
this
court
has
evolved
and
the
latest
of
the
cases
would
be
nebraska
versus
wyoming.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
find
on
a
review
of
yesterday's
proceedings
that
the
points
that
i
had
intended
to
return
to
this
morning
have
been
enlarged
part
--
anticipated
by
corrections
from
the
bench.
and
i
shall
--
consequently
this
morning
simply
identify
for
you
the
places
in
our
reply
brief
where
the
material
is
found
which
i
referred
yesterday,
invite
your
attention
to
it
and
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
unless
there
are
questions
this
morning.
the
reply
brief
was
follow
--
was
filed
october
2,
1961.
the
limitation
issue
is
found
beginning
at
page
19.
it
is
captioned,
“the
legislative
history
of
the
project
act
does
not
support
severance
of
the
colorado
river
compact
from
the
california
limitation
agreement”.
the
priority
issue
is
covered
beginning
at
page
34
and
it
is
captioned,
“the
priorities
of
california's
established
projects
up
to
4,400,000
acre-feet
annually
should
be
protected
from
impairment
by
new
projects
in
arizona
and
nevada”.
the
water
supply
or
justiciability
issue
is
covered
beginning
at
page
98.
and
if
this
caption
--
if
the
conclusion
is
reached
by
the
special
master
as
urged
by
the
other
parties
are
correct,
this
controversy
is
not
justiciable.
it
goes
on
to
say,
however,
that
upon
our
premises,
this
controversy
is
justiciable.
and
may
i
invite
your
attention
also
to
the
preliminary
material
which
begins
at
page
1
which
is
captioned,
“the
basic
controversy”.
and
here,
we
attempt
to
sum
up
the
impact
of
these
three
issues.
the
limitation
or
severance
issue,
as
we
sometimes
call
it,
the
priority
issue
and
the
jurisdictional
water
supply
issue
as
compared
with
california's
claims
and
the
impact,
the
effect
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
and
now
may
it
please
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
in
our
reply
brief
of
october
2,
1961.
that
brief
in
turn
gives
cross
references
to
the
more
detailed
treatment
of
these
materials
in
our
earlier
briefs
and
also
a
cross
references
to
what
our
opponents
would
have
to
say
about
them
up
to
that
time.
and
so
now
if
may
it
please
the
court,
i
--
unless
there
are
questions,
i
shall
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
northcutt
ely
may
it
please
the
court.
california
has
two
basic
exceptions
to
the
report
of
the
special
master
which
is
before
you.
these
relate
primarily
to
his
interpretation
of
section
5
and
section
4
(a)
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
section
5
appears
at
the
pages
384
and
385
of
his
report
and
in
essence,
it
provides
so
far
as
water
for
consumptive
use
is
concerned,
that
the
sectary
of
interior
is
authorized
under
general
regulations
which
he
may
prescribe
to
contract
for
the
storage
of
water
in
the
reservoir
and
for
its
delivery
on
such
points
upon
the
river
or
the
canal,
meaning
the
all-american
canal,
as
he
may
agree
upon.
it
provides
that
contracts
for
water
for
irrigation
and
domestic
use
shall
be
for
permanent
service
and
shall
conform
to
paragraph
(a)
of
section
4
of
the
act.
the
final
sentence
upon
which
the
master
relies
heavily
provides
that
no
person
shall
have
or
be
entitled
to
have
the
use
for
any
purpose
of
the
water
stored
as
aforesaid
except
by
a
contract
made
as
herein
stated.
section
4
(a)
of
the
act
appears
beginning
at
pages
300
--
page
381
of
the
report
and
in
essence,
it
provides
this.
this
statute
as
you
may
recall
authorized
the
construction
of
a
dam,
now
known
as
hoover
dam,
and
of
the
all-american
canal.
and
the
grant
of
the
consent
of
congress
to
the
colorado
river
compact,
an
agreement
which
had
been
signed
by
representatives
of
the
seven
states
of
the
basin
in
1922
had
been
ratified
by
six,
but
arizona
had
refused
to
ratify
it.
section
4
(a)
provides
that
the
act
shall
not
become
effective
until
these
seven
states
shall
have
ratified
the
compact
or
in
the
alternative,
if
seven
shall
fail
to
ratify
within
six
months
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
then
until
six
who
ratified
including
california,
and
in
addition,
california
in
that
event
should
have
enacted
a
limitation
upon
her
use
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river.
this
limitation
is
stated
on
page
382,
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
appear
the
operative
words.
it
provides
that
the
legislature
of
california
shall
pass
an
act
which
shall
limit
california's
uses
of
the
water
to
two
components:
first,
not
to
exceed
4,400,000
acre-feet
per
annum
of
diversions
less
returns
consumptive
use
of
the
waters
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
states
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact
plus
not
to
exceed
one-half
of
the
excess
or
surplus
waters
unapportioned
by
the
compact,
such
uses
always
to
be
subject
to
the
terms
of
the
said
compact.
the
colorado
river
compact,
to
which
reference
is
made,
appears
at
page
373
of
the
report.
article
iii
(a),
apportions
to
the
upper
basin
and
to
the
lower
basin
respectively,
in
perpetuity
the
beneficial
consumptive
use
of
7,500,000
acre-feet
per
annum
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system.
the
system
is
defined
in
article
ii
as
including
the
main
river
and
its
tributaries.
the
7,500,000
acre-feet
shall
include
all
water
necessary
for
the
supply
of
any
rights
which
may
now
exist.
the
two
issues
involved
in
these
two
sections
are
--
i'll
illustrate
in
a
moment
by
reference
to
the
map
which
is
behind
me.
but
in
essence,
they
are
these.
section
4
(a)
required
of
california
a
covenant,
an
agreement
with
the
legislates
--
between
the
legislature
of
california
and
the
congress
of
united
states
which
is
explicit
a
limitation
in
two
categories:
4,400,000
acre-feet
plus
one-half
of
the
excess
or
surplus.
california
enacted
that
limitation.
we
undertook
that
agreement.
the
president
so
proclaimed
and
the
act
became
effective
because
we
did
it.
we
say
that
the
figure
of
4,400,000
acre-feet
is
a
quantitative
limitation.
it
is
the
absolute
minimum,
the
irreducible
minimum
of
the
requirements
of
california's
projects
and
that
we
agreed
to
prorate
with
other
users
the
excess
and
sub-surplus.
we
agreed
to
limit
ourselves
to
one-half
of
that.
the
master
construes
section
5
as
authorizing
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
treat
these
4,400,000
acre-feet
not
as
a
quantitative
limitation,
as
an
irreducible
minimum
as
we
call
it,
but
as
simply
one
component,
not
a
contractual
allocation
scheme
that
is,
that
section
5
delegated
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
“impose
a
federal
apportionment”
upon
these
states
if
they
should
fail
to
agree
upon
an
interstate
compact
and
that
the
secretary
did
so
by
contracts
which
he
made
with
users
in
california
in
1931
to
1934
and
with
arizona
and
nevada,
those
two
states
in
1944.
that
is
to
say
that
they
came
into
existence.
in
1944,
a
contractual
apportionment
made
by
the
secretary
which
had
the
effect
of
imposing
upon
these
three
states
a
proration
scheme.
the
decree
would
put
the
--
this
result
into
effect
that
if
the
secretary
releases
from
lake
mead
enough
water
to
sustain
7,500,000
acre-feet
per
annum
of
consumptive
use
below
lake
mead,
that
seven
and
a
half
million
shall
be
apportioned
4,400,000
acre-feet
to
california,
2,800,000
acre-feet
to
arizona,
300,000
acre-feet
to
nevada.
the
latter
two
figures
being
derived
from
the
1944
contracts,
the
4,400,000
figure
being
the
first
component
of
our
limitation.
if
there's
excess,
if
the
secretary
releases
enough
water
to
sustain
more
than
seven
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use,
that
excess
is
to
be
divided
one-half
to
california,
one-half
to
arizona
and
nevada.
but,
and
here
is
the
rub,
if
the
secretary
releases
insufficient
water
to
sustain
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
from
lake
mead
and
below,
then
the
supply
made
available
shall
be
prorated.
california
shall
have
forty-four
seventy
fifths
of
the
quantity
which
the
secretary
in
his
discretion
neglects
to
make
available,
arizona
twenty-eight
seventy
fifths,
nevada
three
seventy
fifths.
with
the
result
that
california
cannot
have
the
4,400,000
acre-feet
to
which
we
agreed,
we
may
have
forty-four
seventy
fifths
of
x,
x
being
the
quantity
which
the
secretary
in
his
discretion
decides
to
make
available.
the
difficulty
with
this
is
that,
if
the
colorado
river
compact
is
enforced,
the
secretary
is
precluded.
if
he
obeys
the
compact,
which
the
statute
tells
that
we
must
for
making
available
below
lake
mead
enough
water
so
that
forty-four
seventy
fifths
of
it
is
4,400,000
acre-feet.
in
short,
the
master
construes
section
5
as
delegating
to
the
secretary
the
authority
to
use
the
4,400,000
acre-feet
which
is
our
limitation
as
a
starting
point
for
further
reduction.
we
construe
section
4
(a)
as
imposing
a
quantitative
limitation
upon
the
rights
of
california
to
stored
water
or
in
a
natural
flow
and
accumulatively.
and
we
attribute
to
section
5
not
the
authority
to
impose
a
--
an
interstate
apportionment
by
contract
with
the
states
individually
but
as
simply
to
make
users
in
these
states
contracts
of
a
type
familiar
in
the
reclamation
law
since
1902,
contracts
which
with
actual
users,
give
to
those
users
rights
to
appropriate
stored
water
and
that
the
rights
in
that
stored
water
are
required
not
by
the
contract
in
a
form
of
a
grant
or
a
patent
but
in
a
form
--
but
by
putting
the
water
to
use.
that
is
in
a
classic
language
of
section
8
of
the
reclamation
law,
“beneficial
use
is
the
basis,
the
measure,
and
the
limit
of
the
right.”
now,
the
map
behind
me
illustrates
both
of
these
issues.
it
shows
in
two
colors,
the
waters
of
the
lower
basin.
the
lower
basin
as
defined
in
the
compact
includes
the
main
river
from
lee
ferry
to
the
mexican
boundary
and
it
includes
all
the
tributaries.
these
tributaries
are
primarily
the
gila
river
which
rises
in
western
new
mexico
traverses
arizona
and
discharges
into
the
colorado
near
yuma.
the
little
colorado
which
rises
in
northwestern
new
mexico
crosses
a
corner
of
arizona
and
discharges
into
the
colorado,
the
virgin
river
which
arises
in
utah
and
crosses
a
corner
of
arizona
and
a
portion
of
nevada
before
reaching
the
main
river.
the
resources
of
the
lower
basin
quantitatively
are
somewhat
like
this.coming
in
at
lee
ferry,
the
river
brings
from
the
upper
basin,
waters
which
are
controlled
by
the
colorado
river
compact.
article
iii
(d)
of
that
compact
provides
that
the
four
upper
states:
colorado,
new
mexico,
utah
and
wyoming,
shall
not
deplete
the
flow
of
the
river
at
lee
ferry
below
an
aggregate
of
75,000,000
acre-feet
in
any
period
of
10
consecutive
years.
the
lower
basin
tributaries
according
to
arizona's
evidence
supplied
about
3,000,000
acre-feet
per
year
to
the
main
river.
of
this
about
half
or
about
a
million
and
a
half
was
supplied
by
the
gila
and
about
half
accumulatively
by
the
little
colorado,
the
virgin
and
the
other
lower
basin
tributaries.
these
are
the
waters
of
the
lower
basin.
with
respect
to
section
4
(a),
the
cross
reference
to
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii,
if
it
is
read
as
written
means
that
california
is
restricted
to
4,400,000
acre-feet
of
a
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
which
is
sustained
by
the
main
river
and
the
tributaries
that
is
the
stream
shown
in
both
blue
and
red
on
this
map
and
is
excluded
from
3,100,000
acre-feet
of
the
waters
apportioned
by
article
iii
(a)
found
in
the
same
fund
of
water,
tributaries
and
main
river
and
excluded
from
half
the
excess
or
surplus.
now,
the
master
construes
section
4
(a)
at
page
173
of
his
report
as
making
an
inappropriate
reference
to
article
iii
(a)
of
the
colorado
river
compact
and
about
the
center
of
the
page
appears
his
key
holding
with
respect
to
that.
he
says,
“thus
i
hold
at
section
4
(a)
of
the
project
act
and
the
california
limitation
act
refer
only
to
the
water
stored
in
lake
mead
and
flowing
in
the
mainstream
below
hoover
dam.”
despite
the
fact
that
article
iii
(a)
of
the
compact
deals
with
the
colorado
river
system
which
is
defined
in
article
ii
(a)
as
including
the
main
--
the
entire
mainstream
and
the
tributaries.
that
is
to
say
the
master
construes
section
4
(a)
as
intending
to
fine
for
california
the
4,400,000
and
to
fine
for
arizona,
and
california
and
nevada
the
3,100,000
out
of
that
segment
of
the
lower
basin
waters
colored
red
on
this
map.
the
result
is
that
3,100,000
acre-feet
which
if
the
compact
referenced
in
4
(a)
means
what
it
says,
must
be
supplied
by
the
tributaries
as
well
as
the
main
river
shall
be
supplied
from
lake
mead
alone.
the
colorado
river
compact
does
not
make
available
to
the
secretary,
water
in
sufficient
quantity
to
sustain
7,500,000
acre-feet
from
the
red
river,
lake
mead
and
below,
it
makes
that
quantity
available
out
of
the
whole
lower
basin,
blue
plus
red.
consequently,
the
problem
with
respect
to
section
4
(a)
is
simply
this,
may
arizona
and
nevada
having
exhausted
a
portion
of
the
compact
apportionment
to
the
lower
basin
by
the
uses
on
the
tributaries.
nevertheless,
claim
that
same
quantity
a
second
time
out
of
lake
mead.
the
consumptive
uses
which
are
in
fact
sustained
by
these
tributaries
measured
as
diversions
less
returns
are
of
the
order
of
2,000,000
acre-feet.
that
is
to
say
that
tributaries
supply
to
the
main
river
and
the
state
of
nature
about
3,000,000
and
about
2,000,000
of
that
is
now
consumed
and
has
been
for
many
years
by
projects
located
on
these
tributaries,
primarily,
in
the
phoenix
area
on
the
gila
river.
that
2,000,000
acre-feet
plainly
according
the
master
is
chargeable
to
consumes
--
burdens
up
exactly
that
same
quantity
of
the
apportionment
to
the
lower
basin.
consequently,
that
use
on
the
tributaries
has
reduced
in
precisely
that
amount
the
quantity
that
arizona,
california
and
nevada
may
claim
or
may
appropriate
out
of
the
main
river.
may
arizona
and
nevada
nevertheless,
having
reduced
the
quantity
available
in
the
aggregate
to
california,
arizona,
nevada
by
those
uses
on
the
tributaries,
claim
that
use
a
second
time,
this
time
c
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
greater
part
of
it
mr
justice
goldberg,
in
arizona,
we
calculate
about
50,000
acre-feet
or
thereabouts,
in
new
mexico
about
a
million
700
odd
thousand
in
a
--
on
the
gila
and
arizona
and
the
balance
of
the
2,000,000
is
made
up
by
uses
on
the
other
tributaries
primarily
the
little
colorado
and
to
some
degree
the
virgin.
with
respect
to
section
5,
the
master
equates
section
5
with
section
4
(a),
that
is
to
say,
he
says
that
section
5
applies
to
the
red
river,
lake
mead
and
below
and
indeed
it
does.
that
is
the
authority
given
to
the
secretary
to
contract
for
storage
in
lake
mead
and
deliver
that
water
below.
and
he
construes
section
5
as
being
a
delegation
to
the
secretary
to
impose
a
federal
apportionment
upon
the
states
if
they
don't
agree
to
apportion
among
themselves
the
water
referred
to
in
section
4
(a).
we
say
there
is
no
identity,
whatever
between
these
two
funds
of
water.
the
authority
given
to
the
secretary
in
section
5
relates
to
only
a
segment
of
the
lower
basin
waters
which
are
covered
by
section
4
(a).
now
there
are,
nevertheless,
substantial
areas
of
agreement
between
the
master
and
ourselves.
he
finds
or
he
concludes
that
in
the
event
of
shortage
in
the
so-called
--
what
i
call
the
red
river,
that
is
lake
mead
to
the
mexican
boundary,
this
shortage
shall
be
disposed
of
by
respect
for
the
law
which
prevails
generally
throughout
the
colorado
river
basin,
that
is
a
law
of
priority
of
appropriation
and
this
court's
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
and
with
certain
exceptions,
the
exceptions
are
important
and
decisive
but
the
general
principally
accepts.
this
court's
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
course
contains
two
primary
elements
as
you
have
pounded
it
out
here
on
the
envelope,
nebraska
versus
wyoming
and
other
cases.
the
first
is
a
recognition
of
interstate
priorities
of
appropriation
and
the
second
is
the
protection
of
existing
uses,
even
the
projects
with
junior
appropriations
are
protected
against
the
destruction
of
their
economy
by
senior
appropriations
and
whereas
in
our
case,
the
two
situations
merged
at
the
existing
economy
as
based
upon
senior
appropriations,
the
reasons
for
the
two
rules
uniting.
now,
the
master
applies
--
spells
it
out,
applies
the
doctrine
of
interest
--
of
equitable
apportionment
and
the
principles
of
priority
in
a
number
of
instances
and
does
it
very
illusively.
he
applies
this
principle
of
equitable
apportionment
for
example
on
deciding
the
issues
between
new
mexico
and
arizona
on
the
gila
river.
he
says,
that
these
principles
will
control
future
disputes
on
the
tributaries
which
he
finds
not
now
justiciable,
the
virgin
and
the
little
colorado
and
he
holds
that
this
principle
of
equitable
apportionment
will
control
any
dispute
that
may
arise
between
a
user
below
hoover
dam
and
a
diverter
above
lake
mead
in
some
future
litigations
here.
the
instances,
in
which
he
applies
priorities
and
the
instances
in
which
she
--
he
denies
their
effect
are
very
cleanly
identified
in
the
report.
for
example,
and
i
should
emphasize
this,
he
creates
no
dichotomy
between
rights
in
natural
flow,
the
unregulated
flow
to
which
a
priority
shall
attach
on
the
one
hand
and
contract
rights
under
section
5
on
the
other,
not
at
all.
he
recognizes
that
priority
principles
apply
to
rights
which
originate
in
section
5
contracts
with
the
single
exception
that
i
shall
shortly
identify.
for
example,
in
the
event
of
a
dispute
between
two
users
below
lake
mead,
whose
rights
originate
solely
in
contract,
never
had
any
appropriations
of
natural
flow
at
all
but
they're
in
the
same
state.
priority
is
attached
and
controls
the
decision
of
that
dispute.
mr.
northcutt
ely
state
law.
he
says
that
the
questions
of
priorities
within
a
state,
in
fact,
the
question
of
whether
a
contract
with
the
united
states
confers
a
water
right
is
a
matter
for
a
decision
by
state
law
and
he
consequently
looks
to
priorities
established
by
the
relative
dates
of
the
contract
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
ickes
versus
fox,
in
principle,
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right,
and
he
buttresses
although
in
that
case
we
--
the
ultimate
resolution
depended
upon
appropriations
under
the
state
law.
these
do
not,
that's
my
point.
he
applies
priority
principles
to
water
rights
originating
in
section
5
contracts
and
that
is
the
point
i
desire
to
make.
he
gives
a
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
either.
if
the
dispute
involves
one
between
two
contractors
within
arizona
neither
of
whom
ever
had
any
appropriation
of
unregulated
flow
both
dependent
wholly
on
section
5
contracts,
he
applies
priority
principles
to
determine
that
dispute.
he
does
not
relegate
the
application
of
priority
principles
to
rights
in
unregulated
flow
originating
in
state
law.
to
the
contrary,
he
recognizes
priorities
attached
to
contract
rights.
he
applies
priority
principles
interstate
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
he
spells
outs
in
--
that
is
correct.
there
is
not
as
yet
because
there's
no
shortage
yet.
mr.
northcutt
ely
but
he
spells
out
in
detail
what
the
intrastate
rights
of
the
various
contractors
shall
be.
they
shall
be
controlled
by
priorities.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
and
our
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
he
respects
that
agreement.
that
agreement
i
shall
describe
a
little
later.
but
he
--
my
point
is
that
if
the
--
if
you
accept
the
master
and
his
word,
he
applies
priority
principles
to
contracts
rights.
he
denies
the
application
of
those
priorities
only
where
the
two
contractors
in
conflict
are
on
opposites
sides
of
the
river.
let
me
pursue
this
a
little
further.
if
a
contractee
below
lake
mead,
has
a
dispute
with
a
diverter
above
lake
mead,
this
dispute
is
to
be
resolved
by
the
application
of
priority
principles,
the
holder
below
lake
mead
relying
entirely
upon
the
contract
may
sue
a
junior
above
lake
mead
who
is
relying
upon
a
diversion
right
acquired
under
state
law
that
priority
created
by
the
contract
establishes
a
relative
date
of
the
two
and
priority
principles
control.
moreover
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
whether
in
different
states
or
the
same
state.
now,
if
they
are
in
different
states,
he
applies
priority
principles
and
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment.
the
contractee
below
hoover
dam
if
located
in
california,
for
example,
may
sue
the
diverter
above
lake
mead
and
enjoin
shutdown
a
junior
--
a
diversion.
if
you
look
up
the
map,
you'll
see
the
interesting
application
of
this
principle
in
the
two
blue
lines
which
take
off
above
lake
mead
into
the
central
arizona
area.
those
are
two
of
the
three
proposed
routes
for
the
central
arizona
project
whose
demand
for
water
triggered
this
lawsuit.
if
the
arizona
or
the
bureau
of
reclamation
decide
to
divert
for
that
project
above
lake
mead,
the
priority
is
junior
to
that
of
the
metropolitan
water
district
in
california
let
us
say,
california
may
sue,
the
master
says,
to
enjoin
that
diversion.
suppose
we
win
the
suit,
a
million
and
200,000
acre-feet
of
diversion
is
enjoined.
that
water
flows
in
the
lake
mead
is
explicit
that
having
reached
lake
mead,
the
water
is
then
controlled
by
his
contractual
allegation
scheme.
we
don't
get
what
we've
just
won,
we
got
44
seventy-fifths
of
it.
and
arizona
users
below
lake
mead
get
28
seventy-fifths
of
it
even
though
they
may
have
been
junior
to
the
defendant
who
may
just
successfully
enjoin
above
lake
mead.
and
nevada
gets
three
seventy-fifths.
now,
if
the
successful
plaintiff
were
a
nevada
user,
it's
even
more
extreme.
she
keeps
three
seventy-fifths
of
her
winnings
and
california
and
arizona
projects
theoretically
might
be
junior
to
the
defeated
upstream
diverter
get
the
balance
of
it.
now,
he
applies
priority
principles
interstate
with
respect
to
use
--
to
the
uses
which
had
been
established
prior
to
1929,
the
effective
date
of
the
project
act
but
measured
only
by
the
quantity
in
fact
used
as
of
1929.
for
example,
in
the
event
of
a
--
an
interstate
dispute
now,
between
two
users
on
opposite
sides
of
the
river,
both
holding
contracts
with
the
unites
states,
he
will
respect
the
interstate
priority
of
a
--
by
dates
of
appropriation
but
only
up
to
the
extent
of
the
quantity
used
in
1929.
with
respect
to
a
federal
reservation
below
lake
mead,
if
it
is
created
before
1929,
he
will
recognize
the
interstate
priority
of
that
of
federal
reservation
not
limited
to
the
quantity
used
in
1929
but
applied
to
the
full
ultimate
requirements
of
that
reserved
area
which
he
adjudicates
in
this
report.
he
fixes
quantitatively
their
ultimate
requirements.
but
if
that
--
if
that
reservation
is
created
after
1929,
then
it
is
dependent
for
its
water
upon
this
proration
formula
interstate.
and
the
ultimate
--
extreme
of
his
logic
is
reached
on
pages
352
and
353
in
the
terms
of
his
proposed
decree
relating
to
the
wildlife
refuges
which
would
be
--
which
are
created
by
the
--
by
executive
order
behind
the
--
two
of
the
dams
on
the
river.
these,
he
gives
that
priority
of
1941,
these
wildlife
refuges
straddle
the
river.
they're
in
arizona
and
in
california.
now,
with
respect
to
ninth
--
to
california,
1941
is
too
late
a
date
to
give
these
ducks
any
water
at
all.
in
arizona,
it's
a
very
good
priority,
these
wildlife
refuges
will
have
water.
the
result
is
that
these
ducks
are
going
to
be
as
confused
as
lawyer's
are
at
the
moment
if
they
land
on
the
california
side
of
the
colorado
river,
they
are
dead
ducks,
it's
dry.
1941
priority
is
no
good
but
if
a
land
in
the
arizona
side,
they
have
a
plenty
of
water
because
the
arizona
apportionment
given
by
this
decree
is
less
than
half
used.
now,
we
say
simply
that,
priorities
apply
under
the
reclamation
law
of
which
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
is
a
supplement,
is
a
part
of.
they
apply
interstate.
they
apply
whether
the
right
is
generated
by
a
state
law
appropriation
or
generated
by
a
contract
made
under
section
5.
now,
the
master,
as
i
have
said,
refuses
recognition
of
this
great
principle
of
equitable
apportionment
in
one
instance
only
and
that
is
where
the
contestants
are
on
opposite
sides
of
the
river,
are
fighting
over
water
that
neither
of
them
used
prior
to
1929
and
both
of
them
hold
contracts
with
united
states.
in
that
event,
and
in
that
single
instance,
they
prorate
under
a
formula
created
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
let
me
say
here
that
this
is
not
a
formula
created
by
the
statute.
he
is
clear
as
can
be
on
that.
he
says
the
statute
itself
did
not
create
any
formula
for
a
division
of
the
water
among
arizona,
california,
and
nevada.
it
created
no
mandatory
--
no
mandatory
formula.
it
delegated
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
power
to
impose
this
federal
apportionment
that
the
secretary
was
not
under
any
obligation
to
contract
with
arizona
or
nevada
or
with
anybody
else
for
any
fixed
quantity
stated
in
the
statute.
he
had
complete
discretion.
he
could've
contracted
with
arizona
for
2,000,000
acre-feet
instead
of
2,800,000
of
consumptive
use.
that
this
apportionment
came
into
existence
therefore
and
on
february
21,
1944
the
secretary
of
the
interior
made
a
contract
with
the
state
of
arizona
and
not
until
that.
and
in
the
interval,
between
a
15-year
interval
between
the
enactment
of
the
project
act,
and
1944,
when
the
secretary
made
that
contract
there
was
not
in
existence
any
contractual
allocation
scheme.
there
was
no
proration
formula.
nobody
knew
what
it
would
be
until
1944
but
the
california
projects
were
built
during
precisely
this
period
between
1929
and
1941.
the
youngest
of
them,
the
metropolitan
water
districts,
colorado
river
aqueduct
was
completed
in
1941.
the
all-american
canal
was
in
service
by
1941.
both
have
been
serving
water
for
three
years
before
the
secretary
made
any
contract
with
arizona.
but
that
retroactively,
this
contractual
allocation
scheme,
this
proration
formula
was
imposed
upon
us
in
1944
and
that
the
bargain
that
controls
this
is
not
that
made
between
the
legislature
of
california
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
1929,
a
limitation
act
which
fixed
a
quantitative
limitation
of
4,400,000
acre-feet
upon
our
contracts
and
our
appropriative
rights
under
state
law
but
it
was
fixed
in
1944
by
a
proration
formula
in
which
our
4,400,000
acre-feet
is
just
one
component,
the
starting
point
for
a
reduction
downgrade.
we
say
that
we
are
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
contract
made,
the
bargain
made
in
1929
with
the
congress.
if
you
compare
what
the
master
sees
as
happening
in
1944,
it's
all
there
--
it
had
been
compressed
into
1929,
all
the
intervening
events.
and
that
somehow
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
promulgated
regulations,
say
in
1930
or
1931,
the
same
in
effect
the
statute
provides
the
states
can
agree.
they
have
not
agreed.
the
statute
provides
that
in
that
event
i
may
impose
a
federal
apportionment.
i
now
do
so
and
in
the
following
terms.
i
don't
like
interstate
priorities,
i
prorate
and
i
now
decide
that
i'm
going
to
make
a
contract
with
arizona
for
2,800,000
acre-feet
and
with
nevada
for
300,000
and
i
impose
proration
in
the
event
of
shortage.
and
furthermore,
i'm
going
to
find
all
of
this
water
out
of
lake
mead,
although
the
boulder
canyon
project
acts
as
i
must
conform
to
the
colorado
river
compact.
i
think
that
section
4
(a)
made
it
inappropriate
reference
to
the
colorado
river
compact
says
the
secretary
in
these
hypothetical
regulations
in
1930
or
1931.
i
think
what
congress
really
meant
was
to
divide
up
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
below
lake
mead.
now,
if
any
secretary
has
sat
down
and
done
that
in
1930
or
1931,
it
needs
no
elaboration
to
say
that
that
kind
of
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
general
regulations
would've
been
promptly
corrected.
the
secretary
never
did
that.you
would
expect
to
find
this
the
most
important
single
act
of
any
secretary
of
the
interior
in
the
history
of
our
country,
one
that
divides
the
waters
of
a
great
river
which
imposes
to
use
the
master's
word,
imposes
a
federal
apportionment
upon
the
states
would've
been
spelled
out
in
regulations,
unless
a
statute
authorize
general
regulations.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right
and
that
definitely
was
repelled
by
this
court.
in
fairness,
i
should
say
that
deterring
the
fund,
the
question
of
whether
the
water
rights
were
referring
to
the
land
under
state
law
but
that
makes
no
difference.
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
which
is
incorporated
as
a
part
of
this
law,
section
14
of
the
project
act
incorporates
reclamation
law,
makes
this
a
part
of
the
reclamation
law.
in
section
8,
to
which
mr.
justice
douglas
--
which
is
involved
in
the
case
mr.
justice
douglas
referred
to,
section
8
provides
that
beneficial
use
shall
be
the
basis
to
measure
the
limit
of
the
right
and
directs
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
proceed
in
accordance
with
state
law
in
acquiring
water
rights.
no,
i
don't
say
to
you
that
that
means
that
a
state
law
of
california,
ex
proprio
vigore
controls
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
the
administration
of
lake
mead.
i
do
not.
what
i
do
say
is
that
congress
as
well
as
this
court
has
had
respect
for
the
philosophy,
the
doctrine
of
priority
of
appropriations
throughout
the
west
and
that
congress
not
only
in
this
section
8
but
in
some
36
statutes
has
directed
that
the
federal
officials
conform
to
this
way
of
life
in
the
west,
priority
of
appropriation
and
shall
not
--
shall
not
arrogate
to
themselves
the
authority
to
prorate
water,
which
is
the
inherent,
the
important
features
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
the
great
point
that
i
--
the
master
makes
and
that
i
try
to
emphasize
is
that
the
problem
here
is
not
whether
state
law
appropriations
control
the
disposition
of
water
from
lake
mead.
it
is
whether
under
federal
law,
the
boulder
canyon
project
act,
section
5,
congress
intend
that
in
the
event
of
shortage,
power
was
delegated
to
the
secretary
to
prorate,
to
impose
a
formula
or
whether
it
reserve
to
this
court
the
power
under
the
--
its
rules
of
equitable
apportionment
to
decide
how
the
burden
of
shortage
shall
be
born.
and
that
is
my
central
message
in
an
attempt
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
if
it
is
not,
then
the
whole
case
is
not
justiciable
because
the
master's
whole
report
is
premised
upon
the
belief
that
the
statute
delegated
to
the
secretary
the
authority
to
make
that
apportionment
and
he
did.
that
he
“forever
allocated.”
we
say
he
didn't
do
any
such
thing.
and
touching
this
question
of
justiciability,
of
the
2,800,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
referred
to
in
the
arizona
1944
contract,
only
some
million
--
a
million
hundred
thousand
has
been
put
to
use.
now,
this
contract
as
--
is
not
on
its
face
an
attempt
to
agree
to
deliver
that
quantity
to
anybody.
it's
not
--
it
doesn't
purport
to
be
a
reservation
of
that
quantity
for
anybody.
what
it
is
says
is
that
the
secretary
will
make
contracts
with
users
in
arizona,
users
in
arizona
who
may
qualify
under
the
reclamation
law
up
to
this
aggregate.
they
haven't
yet
done
so.
you
don't
know
who
they're
going
to
be
nor
under
what
federal
statutes
they'll
be
created.
now,
if
the
statute
that
comes
along
later
and
authorizes
a
project
that
creates
a
shortage,
there's
no
shortage
now,
provides
on
its
face
respect
for
the
priorities
of
existing
projects
then
it's
questionable
whether
we
ever
have
any
quarrel
of
such
a
project.
we
may
very
well
be
litigating
the
wrong
statute
right
now.
but,
if
you
adopt
this
--
the
master's
premise,
that
this
contract
forever
allocated,
forever
apportioned
like
an
interstate
compact
would,
then
and
only
upon
that
premise
do
you
reach
the
basis
of
a
justiciable
controversy.
and
you
don't
really
reach
that
event
unless,
unless
you
give
respect
to
the
colorado
river
compact
as
restricting
and
controlling
the
water
available
for
division
in
the
lower
basin.
if
as
the
master
does,
you
treat
the
compact
as
something
rather
a
distant,
as
irrelevant
as
he
calls
it.
then
it's
difficult
to
find
where
there
is
a
disparity
between
supply
and
demand
that
would
create
a
present
justiciable
controversy.
water
always
has
come
down
at
lee
ferry
in
sufficient
quantities
to
satisfy
the
maximum
demands,
i
repeat,
the
maximum
demands
of
all
of
the
states
now
before
you
plus
the
mexican
water
treaty
plus
all
the
losses.
it
is
only
because
the
compact
is
known
to
be
controlling
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
to
be
imposing
a
restriction
upon
the
quantity
we
may
appropriate
from
the
main
river
as
well
as
the
tributaries
that
there
is
any
shortage
at
all.
you
cannot,
on
the
one
hand,
treat
the
compact
as
irrelevant
as
the
master
does,
and
on
the
other
hand,
find
a
shortage
to
be
adjudicated
here.
we
say
that
the
compact
is
operative.
it
is
fatuous
to
assume
that
it
will
not
be
enforced
and
that
there
is
a
shortage,
a
shortage
so
dire
indeed
that
if
the
master's
report
is
applied
to
the
quantity
lawfully
available
to
the
lower
basin,
one
at
least
of
our
great
projects
would
be
destroyed.
but
if
you
treat
the
compact
as
not
meaning
that,
there's
no
assurance
of
any
such
projects
will
ever
be
built
to
create
a
shortage
then
you
better
wait
till
you
see
the
statutes
that
authorize
those
projects
to
find
what
it
does
with
respect
to
existing
uses.
we
say
the
controversy
is
justiciable
but
because
the
compact
is
enforceable
and
it
is
about
to
be
enforced
and
we
say
that
the
--
as
among
the
lower
basin
states,
the
controversy
is
justiciable.
but
if
you
he
had
held
the
master's
premise
with
respect
to
the
compact,
it
is
probably
not.
now,
i
should
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
this
provision
in
my
argument.
i'd
like
to
treat
first
section
5,
just
what
kind
of
contracts,
what
kind
of
contracts
did
these
--
this
section
anticipate
the
secretary
would
make.
did
it
ever
contemplate
a
contract
with
the
state
which
would
be
in
effect
an
interstate
apportionment,
the
compact?
it
did
not,
plainly.
what
it
did
do
was
to
authorize
contracts
with
equit
--
with
actual
water
users.
the
true
question
in
section
5
results
for
in
the
act,
where
in
the
statute
is
any
section
that
cut
off
at
state
lines
the
doctrine
of
priority
of
appropriation?
this
--
the
water
rights
to
which
section
4
(a)
refers
are
in
two
categories,
rights
which
may
now
exist
and
rights
required
by
contract
under
this
act.
it
is
--
it
was
a
quantitative
limitation.
section
4
(a)
demonstrates
how
congress
knew
how
to
draw
the
difference
between
a
quantitative
limitation
of
4,400,000
acre-feet
on
the
one
hand
and
a
fractional
allocation,
one-half
of
the
excess
or
surplus
on
the
other.
had
it
intended
to
treat
4,400,000
acre-feet
as
simply
the
numerator
in
a
fraction,
it
was
very
easy
to
say
so.
if
congress
meant
not
4,400,000
acre-feet
but
44
seventy-fifths,
it
was
just
as
easy
to
say
that
as
it
was
to
say
one-half
of
the
excess
or
surplus.
it
didn't
do
it.
now,
this
limitation,
the
master
says
and
we
think
he's
right,
is
not
a
source
of
right
for
california.
congress
didn't
grant
us
anything.
it's
a
limitation
upon
rights
derived
from
other
sources.
these
other
sources
are
spelled
in
the
statute,
rights
which
may
now
exist,
what
could
they
be
except
rights
acquired
under
state
law.
rights
acquired
by
contract
under
this
act.
and
it
provides
that
no
step
shall
be
taken
to
initiate
or
perfect
a
right
under
this
statute
except
upon
the
proclamation
of
the
effect
of
this
limitation.
now,
what
does
initiate
or
perfect
mean?
these
steps
are
separated
by
years
in
point
of
time.
you
initiate
a
project
by
filing
a
notice
of
appropriation
or
as
we
say
by
making
a
contract
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
you
perfect
it
by
building
your
works
and
putting
the
water
to
use.
they
are
separated
by
five
years,
20
years,
50
years.
you
don't
initiate
and
perfect
simultaneously.
let
me
direct
your
attention,
if
i
may,
to
that
language
of
the
statute.
it
is
at
the
top
of
page
382,
it
directs
that
no
water
rights
shall
be
claimed
or
initiated
hereunder.
well,
you
--
that
is
under
the
statute.
and
no
step
shall
be
taken
by
the
united
states
or
by
others
to
initiate
or
perfect
any
claims
to
the
use
of
water
until
this
limitation
has
become
effective.
that's
the
language
of
appropriation.
that's
not
language
of
grant.
section
5,
certainly
on
its
face
does
not
purport
to
convey
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
any
power
to
prorate,
to
apportion
and
to
allocate.
it
is
in
the
familiar
pattern
of
the
reclamation
law,
familiar
for
30
years
before
that.
and
the
last
sentence
of
that
section
upon
which
the
master
relies
so
heavily
that
no
person
shall
have
a
right
to
the
use
of
a
stored
water
without
a
contract
was
simply
a
device
inserted
in
the
statute
by
the
representatives
of
the
upper
basin
states
confronted
by
the
probability
that
arizona
would
not
ratify
the
colorado
river
compact
and
indeed
she
didn't
for
15
more
years.
and
they
provided
in
this
way
that
this
contract
--
that
such
a
contract
must
be
read
in
tandem
with
section
8
(a).
now,
section
8
(a)
provides
that
the
united
states
--
i'll
find
that
for
you.
it's
at
page
389.
it
provides
that
the
united
states,
its
permitees,
licensees,
contractees,
and
all
users
and
appropriators
of
water
stored,
appropriators
of
water
stored
shall
be
subject
to
and
controlled
by
the
compact
anything
in
this
act
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding.
this,
when
read
with
sections
13
(b),
(c),
and
(d),
simply
provided
a
device
by
which
all
users
of
water
below
lake
mead
should
be
subjected
to
the
colorado
river
compact
by
a
covenant
in
the
water
delivery
contracts
even
though
that
water
is
used
in
arizona
in
a
state
that
refused
to
ratify
the
compact
and
that's
all
that
that
sentence
means.
this
legislative
history
is
clear
as
a
bell.
the
upper
basin
spokesman
was
delph
carpenter,
the
principal
author
of
the
compact.
he
explained
that
before
the
congressional
committees
that
this
was
precise
in
his
purpose.
it
was
not
intended
to
affect
interstate
the
rights
of
arizona
and
california.
section
5
we
say
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me.
mr.
northcutt
ely
right.
it
meant
that
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
as
mr.
carpenter
explained
--
let
me
have
it
--
perhaps
i
can
simply
give
it
in
mr.
carpenter's
language
as
--
better
than
this.
the
thought
of
his
amendment,
that's
this
last
sentence
of
section
5,
is
that
any
water
stored
in
this
reservoir
under
the
terms
of
the
compact
when
released
from
storage
shall
be
burdened
by
the
compact
wherever
it
goes.
as
far
as
water
is
concerned,
existing
claims
of
the
lower
states
are
protected
by
the
compact.
water
must
pass
through
this
reservoir
to
take
care
of
their
present
existing
lower
claims.
as
the
further
development
from
the
main
river,
we
insist
that
water
stored
in
this
structure
by
the
united
states
would
be
stored
and
released
upon
the
expressed
condition
that
the
persons
who
received
the
water
shall
respect
and
do
so
under
the
compact.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
interstate
relations
between
arizona
and
california.
that
is
to
say
that
arizona
users
--
arizona's
failure
to
ratify
the
compact,
the
arizona
users
must
have
contracts.
those
contracts
say
they
are
subject
to
and
controlled
by
the
compact.
therefore,
these
users
in
arizona
cannot
be
treated
as
appropriations
raged
on
the
river
free
of
and
outside
the
quantitative
limitation
imposed
by
article
iii
on
the
lower
basin.
that
is
if
seven
and
one-half
million
acre-feet
as
being
used
in
the
tributaries
plus
the
main
river
that
exhaust
the
lower
basin
apportionment.
arizona,
failing
to
ratify
the
compact
cannot
increase
the
appropriations
upon
the
system
by
uses
beyond
that
below
lake
mead
because
those
contracts
provide
for
this
quantitative
overall
limitation.
that
was
the
purpose
of
section
--
of
that
sentence
in
section
5.
now,
of
a
--
controls
upon
the
secretary
upon
section
5
imposed
by
this
act,
section
14
is
of
preeminent
importance.
section
14
appears
at
page
394,
it
says
this
act
shall
be
deemed
to
a
supplement
to
the
reclamation
law
which
said
the
reclamation
law
shall
govern
the
construction
operation
and
management
of
the
works
here
and
authorized
except
is
otherwise
herein
provided.
of
the
reclamation
law,
section
8
is
a
section
that
most
directly
controlling
here
and
i've
already
told
you
what
it
contains.
we
say
that
the
language
in
section
8
that
provides
the
beneficial
use
shall
be
the
basis,
the
measure
and
the
limit
of
the
right,
makes
it
impossible
for
the
secretary
of
the
interior
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
to
reserve,
to
set
aside
in
block
a
quantitative
water
for
arizona
by
the
arizona
water
contract
in
1944
which
is
not
initiated
by
use,
it's
not
lost
by
disuse,
is
an
apportionment
in
perpetuity
that
it
is
ultra
vires
if
given
that
effect
in
the
teeth
of
section
8.
and
as
i
shall
indicate
later,
sect
--
the
arizona
contract
doesn't
purport
to
do
any
such
thing.
section
5
provides
that
this
contract
shall
be
for
a
permanent
service.
now,
the
master
twice
based
in
clear
terms
the
purpose
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
“permanent
service”,
great
projects
such
as
the
metropolitan
water
district
must
have
a
stable
source
of
water
supply.
permanent
service
is
the
equivalent
of
a
principal
feature
of
the
law
of
priority
of
appropriation.
certainty,
you
can
get
certainty
under
the
appropriation
law
because
you
can
ascertain
what
priorities
are
superior
to
yours,
you
build
--
you
are
protected
against
juniors.
you
do
not
face
the
possibility
that
some
administrative
officer
15
years
later
after
you
built
will
impose
a
proration
formula.
the
law
of
appropriation
gives
stability.
permanent
service
was
intended,
says
the
master
to
give
stability,
to
do
more
than
simply
outlaw
term
contracts.
section
5
provides
that
it
is
--
shall
--
the
secretary's
contract
shall
conform
to
section
4
(a).
we
say
conform
means
conform
and
doesn't
mean
that
the
secretary
may
reduce
our
4,400,000
acre-feet
by
a
proration
formula
discovered
15
years
later
and
imposed
by
a
contract
then
made.
and
to
come
to
the
ultimate
of
the
application
of
the
master's
contrary
theory
of
what
section
5
meant,
he
holds
that
the
arizona
contract
which
purports
to
allocate
to
arizona
50%
of
the
excess
or
surplus,
and
to
give
cal
--
nevada
a
right
to
4%
of
that
50%
that
that
contract
made
with
arizona
by
implication
reserves
to
california
one-half
of
the
excess
or
surplus
because
the
only
contractor
to
give
half
of
it
arizona.
now,
think
what
this
means,
this
means
that
our
right
to
one-half
of
the
excess
or
surplus,
however
you
define
excess
or
surplus,
doesn't
originate
in
the
section
4
(a)
of
the
project
act,
the
bargain
we
made
with
congress
by
passing
our
limitation
act,
not
at
all.
but
we
got
our
right
to
one-half
of
the
excess
or
surplus
by
implication
and
the
terms
of
the
contract
made
with
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
with
arizona
15
years
later
and
that's
where
nevada
got
4%
of
excess
or
surplus.
now,
we
say
you
can't
read
into
section
5
any
kind
of
a
delegation
like
that.
we
made
our
bargain
in
1929.
we're
not
dependent
for
our
right
to
one-half
for
excess
or
surplus
upon
an
implied
reservation
made
by
the
secretary
in
the
contract
to
somebody
else
15
years
later
and
three
years
after
our
projects
were
completed.
we
say
that
section
5
was
controlled
also
by
section
18
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
section
18
appears
at
page
395
and
it
says
that
nothing
herein
shall
be
construed
as
interfering
with
such
rights
as
the
states
now
have
either
to
the
waters
within
their
borders
or
to
adopt
such
policies
and
enact
such
laws
as
they
may
be
necessary
with
respect
to
the
appropriation,
control
and
use
of
waters
within
their
borders
--
pardon,
except
as
modified
by
the
colorado
river
compact
or
other
interstate
agreement.
that
section
went
into
the
act
as
an
amendment
offered
by
senator
king
of
utah
who
had
become
vastly
disturbed
by
the
representation
of
senator
hayden
that
this
act
somehow
is
going
to
authorize
some
kind
of
a
federal
apportionment.
hayden
was
talking
not
about
arizona
versus
california
but
the
imposition
of
the
colorado
river
compact
upon
arizona
without
her
consent.
and
senator
king
after
a
famous
colloquy
with
hayden
in
which
he
denied
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
put
its
hands
on
a
river
in
that
fashion
offered
section
18,
it
was
adopted.
after
that,
king
supported
the
act,
the
bill.
this
section
18
is
given
respect
by
the
master,
intrastate.
he
uses
it
to
buttress
his
conclusion
that
within
the
state
priorities
of
contract
holders
controlled
their
relative
rights
in
reliance
upon
section
18.
he
believes
and
we
are
willing
to
an
extent,
he
believes
that
a
section
5
contract
putting
to
one
side
this
interstate
apportionment
effect
to
the
arizona
contract,
a
section
5
contract
with
the
water
user
doesn't
necessarily
give
that
water
user
a
water
right.
state
law
determines
that
that
the
user
must
find
under
state
law
under
section
18
a
right
to
take
and
receive
that
water
and
section
5
is
the
secretary's
consent
that
he
may
do
so.
now,
section
18
was
given
interstate
effect
by
this
court
and
refers
to
arizona
versus
california
case
in
283
u.s.
arizona
sued
here
to
enjoin
the
construction
of
hoover
dam
and
to
have
the
colorado
river
compact
declared
inoperative
on
two
grounds:
one
that
the
construction
of
the
dam
would
invade
her
sovereignty;
second,
as
she
put
it
that
the
mere
existence
of
the
act,
section
5
i
supposed,
would
prevent
the
state
of
arizona
to
an
exercise
in
her
sovereignty
to
prevent
or
permit
appropriations
of
water
from
the
colorado
river.
mr.
justice
brandies
for
this
court
quoted
section
18,
held
that
nothing
in
this
act,
the
boulder
canyon
project
act,
interferes
with
arizona's
right
to
initiate
or
perfect
appropriations.
now,
if
judge
rifkind
is
correct,
the
court
must've
been
mistaken
in
283
u.s.
because
the
whole
premise
of
this
report
of
the
special
master
is
that
the
project
act
had
done
exactly
what
arizona
then
complained
of.
it
had
cut
off.
it
had
ended
the
right
of
states
to
appropriate
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
below
lake
mead.
if
the
master
is
right,
you
got
such
a
right
only
out
of
a
federal
contract
and
in
the
secretary's
discretion.
before
i
leave
section
8
of
the
reclamation
law,
i've
talked
now
about
section
18
of
the
project
act.
let
me
revert
to
section
8
of
the
reclamation
law
incorporated
by
section
14.
this
court
in
wyoming
versus
colorado
and
nebraska
versus
wyoming
cited
section
8
in
interstate
cases.
you
treated
it
not
as
necessarily
applying
a
state
appropriation
to
control
the
federal
official
but
as
expressing
the
intent
of
congress
to
treat
as
federal
interstate
common
law
the
principle
established
by
state
law
of
priorities
of
appropriation
applied
across
state
lines
that
as
federal
law,
you
picked
up
the
philosophy
of
a
western
law
of
appropriation
in
section
8
for
the
reclamation
act.
and
we
think
the
master
is
wrong
in
restricting
section
8
to
intrastate
effect
as
he
also
restricts
section
18
of
the
project
act.
in
the
united
states
versus
arizona,
this
court
again
had
occasion
to
consider
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
this
was
the
case
as
you
may
remember
in
which
arizona
had
called
out
the
militia
to
stop
the
construction
of
parker
dam.
the
united
states
sued
to
enjoin
that
military
interference.
the
injunction
was
denied
because
of
lack
of
the
authority
of
the
unite
--
of
the
secretary's
statutory
authority
to
build
the
dam.
but
in
the
course
of
that
opinion,
this
court
said
that
arizona
owns
the
land
under
this
navigable
stream
to
the
thread
of
the
stream
and
has
a
right
to
appropriate
an
equitable
share
of
the
flow
of
the
stream.
and
the
court
cited
section
14
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
as
incorporating
--
as
incorporating
the
reclamation
law,
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
arizona
had
this
right
unaffected
by
any
provision
of
the
colorado
river
compact
or
a
federal
reclamation
law.
now,
if
the
master
is
right,
that
pronouncement
by
this
court
in
united
states
versus
arizona
must
have
been
mistaken
because
if
he
is
right,
the
project
act
had
cut
off
arizona's
right
to
appropriate
the
waters
of
the
stream.
in
short,
the
master
deduces
from
the
existence
of
contracts
made
some
15
years
apart,
the
arizona
contract
of
1944
or
contracts
made
in
1931
to
1934.
a
contractual
allocation
scheme
and
apportionment
as
--
so
that
had
been
made
by
the
statute,
not
by
the
statute
itself,
i
should
be
clear
upon
that
but
by
the
secretary
immediately
after
enactment
of
the
statute.
if
you
look
at
the
arizona
contract
itself,
you
don't
find
any
support
for
this.
if
any
contractual
allocation
scheme,
any
federal
apportionment
was
ever
created,
that's
the
single
piece
of
paper
that
did
it.
you
don't
find
the
regulations.
you
don't
find
any
document
with
a
signature
of
the
secretary
that
can
have
any
such
effect
except
the
arizona
contract,
and
it
doesn't
purport
to
do
that.
this
contract
says
that
it
is
made
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
reclamation
law
including
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
it
provides
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
agrees
to
deliver
to
make
contracts,
to
make
contracts
with
users
in
arizona
who
may
qualify
under
the
reclamation
law,
but
that
he
will
make
such
contracts
only
up
to
a
total
delivery
obligation
of
2,800,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use.
but
in
section
--
in
article
vii
now,
he
provides
that
this
contract
does
not
impair
any
present
perfected
rights.
and
speaking
of
1944,
that's
three
years
after
our
con
--
our
projects
were
completed
in
operation,
1944
present
perfected
rights,
what
does
it
mean?
it
is
surely
a
promise
of
respect
by
the
secretary
for
the
doctrine
of
priority
of
appropriation
interstate,
what
were
the
present
perfected
rights
except
ours?
it
also
provides
in
so
many
words
in
article
x
that
nothing
in
this
contract
shall
be
deemed
to
determine
the
allocation
to
any
state
of
the
waters
apportioned
by
any
category
of
the
colorado
river
compact
in
order
to
determine
any
question
of
interstate
priorities.
in
an
accompanying
decision
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
1944,
he
said
that
this
language
of
article
x
was
intended
to
reserve
for
a
judicial
determination
all
of
these
questions.
we
say
it
did.
that
there
does
not
exist
any
document
which
effects
a
--
an
interstate
apportionment,
none
ever
purported
to.
this
is
a
synthesis
by
the
master.
now,
i
referred
earlier
to
what
had
happened
in
this
15-year
period.
let
me
emphasize
it
again.
in
1931,
the
metropolitan
water
district
of
southern
california
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
united
states
in
1930
and
1931.
under
both
sections
5
and
section
4
(b)
of
this
act,
section
4
(b)
provided
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
should
not
undertake
the
construction
of
hoover
dam
unless
and
until
he
had
in
hand
contracts
which
would
liquidate
the
government's
investment
with
interest
and
plus
operation
and
maintenance.
he
was
able
to
do
this
by
making
power
contracts
and
contracts
of
the
storage
and
delivery
of
water.
the
first
grade
--
when
he
made
was
with
the
metropolitan
water
district.
it
committed
itself
to
pay
for
36%
of
the
firm
energy
to
be
generated
in
hoover
dam,
to
be
paid
for
whether
used
or
not
but
to
be
used
only
for
pumping
water
into
and
in
the
aqueduct
to
propose
the
bill.
the
project
act's
legislative
history
is
full
of
references
through
the
intent
of
this
project
to
furnish
water
for
the
coastal
plain
of
southern
california
to
an
aqueduct
to
be
built
by
these
cities
at
their
own
expense
however.
these
two
contracts
remained,
the
water
contract
provides
for
permanent
service.
in
1931,
the
secretary
about
to
make
a
contract
under
section
4
(b)
as
well
as
section
5
with
the
--
those
to
use
the
all-american
canal
called
upon
the
perspective
users
in
california
to
get
together
with
the
state
and
submit
a
schedule
of
internal
priorities
to
which
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
earlier.
this
was
done.
that
is
incorporated
in
all
of
the
california
water
contracts.
it
provides
respect
for
the
california
priorities
internally
at
least.
it
--
the
figures
in
it
are
not
taken
out
of
the
air.
the
relative
priority
dates
are
those
established
by
state
law
appropriations.
the
quantities
are
those
appropriated
under
state
law.
the
secretary
agrees
to
deliver
those
quantities
subject
to
the
availability
of
water
in
california
under
the
project
act
in
the
compact.
the
metropolitan
water
district
proceeded
to
construct
this
aqueduct,
sold
over
$200
million
worth
of
bonds
but
it
didn't
do
that
until
this
court's
decision
had
come
down
in
283
u.s.
in
which
you
construed
section
18
as
sustaining
interstate
--
the
priorities
acquired
under
state
law.
at
least
you
said
that
--
the
court
said
that
arizona's
right
to
appropriate
was
not
cut
off
by
the
project
act
and
you've
cited
section
18.
they
were
senior
to
the
metropolitan
water
district,
the
rights
of
the
other
agriculture
users
in
california,
the
palo
verde
irrigation
district,
the
imperial
irrigation
district
and
the
coachella
valley
county
water
district
to
the
extent
of
3,850,000
acre-feet,
the
metropolitan's
contract
call
4,212,000.
only
half
of
that
is
within
our
4,400,000,
550,000,
612,000
is
dependent
upon
the
availability
of
excess
or
surplus.
the
district
proceeded
to
bill
this
aqueduct
at
its
own
expense.
it
went
into
service
in
1941.
never
throughout
any
of
this
history
was
there
any
indication
from
anyone
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
believed
that
he
had
been
delegated
power
by
congress
to
cut
down
the
4,400,000
acre-feet
by
an
interstate
apportionment
he
might
later
make.
in
fact,
the
district's
contracts
were
before
congress
on
three
separate
occasions
in
an
act
which
authorized
a
right
of
way
for
this
aqueduct
across
public
lands
in
an
act
which
ratified
this
parker
dam
contracts
and
gave
the
secretary
power
to
build
it
after
the
adverse
decision
in
united
states
versus
arizona.
and
finally
in
1941,
when
the
congress
passed
the
boulder
canyon
project
adjustment
act
which
in
terms
requires
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
rely
upon
this
district
for
some
35%
of
the
funds
to
repay
the
cost
of
hoover
dam.
and
in
1941,
in
that
same
statute,
congress
reenacted
section
18
provided
in
so
many
words
that
the
provisions
of
the
project
act
should
continue
to
be
operative
except
as
special
--
specifically
amended
here.
the
district
began
in
service
in
1941.
the
all-american
canal
was
finished
in
1941.
now,
bear
in
mind
that
both
of
these
great
projects
are
not
just
projects
built
under
section
5
with
water
contracts
with
the
secretary,
these
are
the
projects
which
under
section
4
(b)
were
required
to
underwrite
hoover
dam
and
the
all-american
canal.
these
are
not
paper
filings.
these
are
not
some
sort
of
exotic
contracts
not
dependent
upon
the
chemistry
of
offering
acceptance
and
considerations,
as
the
master
says.
the
metropolitan
water
district
undertook
a
contract
with
united
states
calling
for
some
$80
million
in
cash
for
power
and
some
$12
million
for
payment
for
storage
of
water.
it
built
an
aqueduct
which
has
cost
over
$400
million.
it
serves
eight
million
people.
half
of
the
water
supply
for
the
coastal
plain
of
southern
california
comes
through
this
aqueduct.
if
the
master's
report
is
sustained,
this
supply
in
its
entirety
will
be
lost
whenever
the
colorado
river
compact's
restrictions
upon
the
water
supply
available
to
the
lower
basin
is
enforced.
this
is
inevitable.
here,
let
me
emphasize
perhaps
what
i
should
have
earlier
the
meaning
of
the
term
“consumptive
use”
the
common
denominator
of
the
master,
the
master's
report,
his
decree,
our
contracts,
the
project
act,
the
colorado
river
compact.
what
is
consumptive
use?
it
is
not
the
flow
of
the
river
at
lee
ferry
or
in
these
tributaries
at
some
designated
point.
it
is
not
the
quantity
diverted
by
a
project.
it
is
a
quantity
diverted
minus
the
part
of
that
that
returns
to
the
stream.
now,
that
has
this
very
great
significance.
as
the
master
says,
“75
million
acre-feet
of
water
flow
in
each
decade
at
lee
ferry”,
under
article
iii
(d)
the
guarantee
of
the
compact,
as
he
calls
it.
while
it
may
be
regulated
by
hoover
dam
into
an
annual
discharge
from
lake
mead
of
7,500,000
acre-feet
will
not
sustain
7,500,000
acre-feet
per
year
of
consumptive
use
below
lake
mead
but
much
less
for
two
reasons.
first,
because
of
losses
in
transit,
evaporation
losses,
channel
losses;
and
second,
because
of
the
returns
to
the
river
which
must
be
deducted
from
this
quantity
even
if
diverted.
and
the
significant
example
of
that
is
the
mexican
boundary.
when
i
was
here
before,
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
about
the
troubles
of
mexico
arising
from
the
quality
of
water
reaching
mexico.
this
is
return
flow
at
the
mexican
boundary.
it
is
salty.
every
irrigation
project
must
keep
alive
by
maintaining
salt
balance
as
much
salt
must
flow
out
of
the
project
as
enters
it.
this
is
agricultural
sewage.
the
quantity
of
water
that
finally
leaves
the
united
states
at
the
mexican
boundary
must
be
deducted
from
the
75
million
acre-feet
received
at
lee
ferry
even
if
you
had
no
losses
in
transit
to
discover
how
much
consumptive
use.
the
iii
(d)
delivery
at
lee
ferry
will
support.
whenever
the
compact
becomes
fully
operative
and
we
are
getting
only
75
million
acre-feet
at
lee
ferry,
the
guarantee
of
the
compact,
we
cannot
sustain
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
below
lake
mead
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
of
last
year,
about
5
million.
we're
not
at
a
full
capacity
quite
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
a
little
less,
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
counting
the
tributaries,
the
uses
from
the
main
river
about
25,000
to
30,000
acre-feet.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
somewhat
less.
if
the
compact
is
enforced,
the
lower
basin
may
appropriate
from
the
main
river,
lee
ferry
to
mexican
boundary
about
six
and
one
half
million
acre-feet
and
--
of
consumptive
use
and
no
more.
if
we
got
44
seventy-fifths
of
that,
we've
got
3,800,000.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
i
haven't
undertaken
to
work
those
figures
too
but
you
cannot
be
far
wrong
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
state
3
million
eighth.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
no.
i'm
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
straighten
this
out.
the
water
supply
that's
going
to
be
available
for
actual
division
under
this
decree
whatever
form
the
decree
it
takes
is
going
to
be
of
the
order
of
6
million
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use.
it
cannot
be
more
than
six
and
a
half
million.
the
6
million
figure
represents
the
remnant
available
entry
flow
of
lee
ferry
as
reduced
to
about
75
million
acre-feet
to
guarantee
the
compact.
wet
water
to
the
extent
of
6
million
acre-feet
of
consumptive
uses,
all
the
three
states
can
expect
to
divide
up.
the
6,500,000
acre-feet
figure
results
from
the
second
restriction
of
the
compact
imposed
by
article
iii
(a)
that
is
that
our
appropriations
cannot
exceed
from
that
whole
system,
7,500,000
million
under
iii
(a).
and
that
consequently
--
if
that
were
the
restriction
and
not
the
reduced
flow
under
iii
(b)
we
could
get
up
perhaps
to
6,500,000
million.
now,
at
page
311
of
the
report,
the
master
shows
what
would
happen
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
6
million
acre-foot
supply
of
consumptive
use.
california
would
get
44
seventy-fifths
of
that
or
3,520,000
acre-feet,
a
reduction
of
about
1,500,000
below
our
current
users.
arizona
in
the
same
circumstances,
he
does
not
give
the
translation
of
the
28
seventy-fifths
but
it
is
2,240,000
acre-feet.
arizona
would
get
something
like
a
million
acre-feet
more
than
her
maximum
uses
by
all
of
her
projects
when
fully
developed.
last
year
they
used
about
a
million,
when
fully
developed
that
required
a
million
and
two.
out
of
a
6
million
acre-foot
supply
whereas
california
would
be
reduced
from
present
uses
by
a
million
and
a
half
acre-feet,
arizona
would
be
permitted
to
approximately
double
her
present
uses.
it
would
find
a
million
acre-feet
for
the
central
arizona
project.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
arizona
diverts
above
the
dam
then
if
the
master's
scenario
is
followed,
we
bring
suit
here
again
to
enjoin
that
diversion
under
doctrines
of
equitable
apportionment.
and
if
we
win
that
suit,
then
she
can't
divert
above
the
dam,
the
--
we
get
44
seventy-fifths
of
what
we've
just
saved,
she
have
to
divert
below
the
dam
in
which
event,
she
will
then
be
able
to
take
the
12,200,000
as
part
of
the
2
million
eight.
but
if
--
to
take
a
smaller
example,
the
master
doesn't
see
any
prospect
of
substantial
diversions
above
the
dam,
since
he
wrote
his
report,
the
phelps
dodge
corporation
for
example
has
appropriated
18,000
acre-feet
and
is
about
to
build
a
smaller
project.
that
is
that
the
threshold
of
what
we
do
about
these
equitable
apportionment
suits
above
the
dam.
shall
we
pursue
each
of
these?
why
--
one
suit
after
another
and
in
what
court?
but
if
arizona
does
divert
that
18,000,
it
doesn't
affect
at
all
under
the
master's
report
a
right
to
precisely
28
seventy-fifths
of
what
comes
out
below
the
dam.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
instead
of
having
2,240,000
acre-feet
from
lake
mead,
she
had
have
2,240,000
minus
the
consumptive
uses
above
the
dam.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
i
understand
correctly
the
government's
suggestion.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
the
master
redefines
the
main
river
from
lake
mead
to
upper
to
lee
ferry
as
a
tributary.
that's
inherent
in
his
scheme.
consequently,
he
treats
them
all
alike.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
depletion
takes
place
on
little
colorado
or
after
little
colorado
enters
the
main
river.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
now,
if
the
--
let
me
revert
again,
if
i
don't
--
if
i
answered
your
question.
let
me
revert
again
to
page
311.
this
displays
why
the
other
figure
that
he
uses
3,600,000
acre-feet
of
california
consumptive
uses,
one
of
the
most
dramatic
effects
of
the
report
are
--
he
calls
a
present
perfected
right
the
quantity
in
fact
used
before
june
25,
1929,
except
that
he
treats
all
federal
reservations
as
having
fully
perfected
rights
as
of
that
date
whether
they
ever
used
any
water
or
not.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
i
will
come
to
section
6
at
present.
now,
he
says
if
--
hypothetically,
california's
present
perfected
rights
of
3,600,000
acre-feet,
that
i
might
say
is
not
a
figure
picked
out
of
the
air.
it's
not
far
off
from
what
our
present
perfected
rights
would
be
under
his
definition.
note
what
happens.
we
get
only
the
quantity
of
water
we
are
using
prior
to
june
25,
1929,
3,600,000
upon
this
assumption.
although,
the
flow
which
support
6
million,
therefore
all
of
the
benefits
of
the
stored
water,
all
of
the
incremental
supply,
2,400,000
acre-feet
in
its
entirety
goes
to
arizona
and
nevada.
our
apportionment
of
the
stored
water,
the
incremental
stored
water
which
we
think
section
5
was
meant
to
touch
at
all
is
zero.
all
of
it
goes
to
the
other
two
states.
and
we
say
that
the
report
by
this
single
page
is
--
its
inconsistency
with
the
intent
of
the
project
act
becomes
obvious.
when
congress
gave
the
authority
to
the
secretary,
the
contract
for
stored
water
under
section
5,
this
was
surely
not
the
intended
result
that
the
dam
that
we
had
to
underwrite
under
section
4
(b),
the
metropolitan
water
district
had
to
pay
for,
the
benefits
of
storage
in
its
entirety
go
to
the
state
which
three
times
sued
in
this
court
to
stop
that
project.
and
none
of
it
at
all
go
to
the
project,
the
metropolitan
water
district
is
paying
for.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
we
do.
i
hold
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
let
me
try
to
spell
that
out.
first
of
all,
article
iii
(d)
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
apportionment
of
consumptive
use
to
the
lower
basin
but
the
master
is
clear
on
that.
we
think
he
is
exactly
correct
in
his
interpretation
of
the
compact.
article
iii
(d)
deals
with
flow,
wet
water,
lee
ferry,
article
iii
(a)
and
iii
(b)
which
apportion
consumptive
use
or
allocate
consumptive
use
in
the
lower
basin,
first
of
all
are
dealing
with
consumptive
use
not
flow
as
iii
(d)
does.
second,
they're
dealing
with
the
tributaries
as
well
as
the
main
river.we
believe
that
it
--
inevitable
that
the
flow
at
lee
ferry
will
be
depleted
by
the
upper
basin
to
the
--
what
the
master
calls
this
guarantee
of
the
compact,
iii
(d),
75
million
acre-feet
every
ten
years.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
even
though
that
may
result
in
their
inability
to
use
the
full
quantity
apportioned
to
the
upper
basin
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right.
that
they
may
not
reduce
that
flow
at
lee
ferry
below
75
million
but
i
do
not
assert
your
honor
that
that
75
million
is
available
for
appropriation
in
the
lower
basin,
part
of
it
is
going
to
be
lost
by
evaporation.
a
part
of
it
is
undoubtedly
available
in
discharge
to
the
mexican
treaty
burden.
the
fact
that
there's
75
million
acre-feet
of
flow
guaranteed
at
lee
ferry
above
the
points
of
use
in
arizona,
california
and
mexico
doesn't
mean
that
it'll
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
oh,
yes,
the
pluses
and
minuses
slowly
vary
and
upon
the
minus
side.
the
inflow
below
lee
ferry
is
not
as
great
as
evaporation
losses.
well,
evaporation
losses
alone
exceed
the
total
inflow
from
lee
ferry
to
the
mexican
boundary
by
something
of
the
order
from
a
million
acre-feet.
as
to
mexico,
the
best
we
could
hope
for
is
that
the
return
flow
at
the
mexican
boundary
from
the
lower
basin
diversions
will
supply
most
of
the
mexican
treaty
requirement.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i'm
assuming
the
plus.
a
plus
is
an
algebraic
--
negative
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
the
losses
exceed
the
inflow.
but
we
have
--
the
record
shows
magnificent
testimony
by
hydrologists
in
an
effort
to
appraise
the
resource
at
lee
ferry,
can
we
recently
expect
more
than
75
million
acre-feet
every
10
years?
the
answer
is
that
if
we
got
every
break
conceivable,
you
could
expect
perhaps
a
million
acre-feet
more
than
that
by
every
break
conceivable,
i
mean
the
optimum
regulation
of
all
upper
basin
reservoirs
and
the
restriction
of
upper
basin
uses
in
that
fashion.
but
that
about
half
of
this
excess
would
have
come
in
tremendous
years,
five
or
six
years
of
flood
so
great
that
hoover
dam
could
not
have
controlled
them.
so
the
apparent
prosperity
is
illusory.
we
cannot
expect
actually
below
lake
mead,
for
years
below
lake
mead
more
than
the
consumptive
use
of
about
6
million
acre-feet.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
not
far
off,
a
little
over
6
million.
that
is
correct.
we
are
now
using
in
the
lower
basin
about
all
that
we
can
expect
to
use
on
a
permanent
basis.
but
it
is
impossible
to
find
your
honor,
water
for
the
proposed
central
arizona
project
an
additional
burden
of
a
1,200,000
without
either
taking
it
away
from
existing
california
projects
or
from
the
upper
basin.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
right.
if
six
million
acre-feet
is
the
consumptive
use
as
a
resource
could
be
divided
by
the
decree
and
if
we
are
sustained
upon
both
our
priority
argument
and
our
limitation
argument,
california
would
get
approximately
4,600,000
acre-feet
of
that,
4,400,000
plus
200,000
acre-feet
of
excess
or
surplus
which
i'll
try
to
explain
a
little
later.
and
arizona
and
nevada
would
get
about
a
1,400,000
acre-feet.
that
is
to
say
something
like
200,000
or
300,000
acre-feet
more
than
the
requirements
of
all
of
their
existing
projects
when
fully
completed.
mr.
northcutt
ely
you're
exactly
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right.
they
would
have
room
for
expansion
on
the
main
river
by
200,000
or
300,000
acre-feet.
now,
however,
i
want
to
call
your
attention
mr.
justice
goldberg
to
a
1961
statute
of
arizona
which
provides
this
with
respect
to
the
central
arizona
project.
it
authorized
a
contract
between
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
bureau
of
reclamation
for
the
investigation
of
these
same
three
routes
that
are
shown
upon
the
map.
but
it
says
this,
provided
further
that
the
contract
for
the
bureau
of
reclamation
shall
provide
that
the
investigations
and
studies
shall
be
restricted
to
only
that
quantity
of
water
which
may
be
available
for
use
in
arizona
after
the
satisfaction
of
all
existing
water
delivery
contracts
between
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
users
in
arizona
for
the
delivery
of
main
stream
water
and
that
nothing
shall
be
done
there
under
which
will
impair
existing
rights
in
arizona
for
the
diversion
use
of
colorado
river
water.
in
short,
arizona
lakes
priorities
fine,
she
thinks
that
her
existing
projects
should
be
protected
against
this
central
arizona
project
but
not
our
projects.
we're
not
entitled
to
that
protection.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
we
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
we
prevailed,
your
honor
and
the
--
on
all
issues
and
the
supply
is
adequate
to
sustain
6
million
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use,
arizona
and
nevada
would
have
1,400,000,
we
would
have
4,600,000.
this
4,600,000
is
less
by
about
half
a
million
acre-feet
than
our
present
uses
but
its
900,000
acre-feet
more
than
the
master
would
give
us
--
pardon
me
1,100,000
acre-feet
more
than
he
would
give
us.
arizona
and
nevada,
if
they
got
1,400,000
would
be
getting
200,000
or
300,000
feet
more
than
their
existing
projects
required.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
is
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
you
mean
this
your
honor,
we
have
no
quarrel,
whatever
with
existing
projects
in
arizona
and
nevada,
there
is
none.
mr.
northcutt
ely
not
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
northcutt
ely
not
as
far
as
i
know.
the
whole
problem
here
is
whether
this
court
shall
render
a
decree
which
in
a
sense
is
an
advisory
opinion
that
arizona
may
take
back
to
the
congress
to
say
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
forever
allocated
--
has
apportioned
to
us
2,800,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
which
contains
a
margin
above
our
existing
projects
of
a
1,600,000
therefore
there
is
water
enough
to
support
the
central
arizona
project
irrespective
of
its
effect
on
california.
there
is
no
quarrel
between
the
three
california
projects
and
any
existing
arizona
projects.
there
has
never
been
a
shortage
of
water
at
lee
ferry
out
of
it
to
sustain
all
our
demands.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
it
may
--
it
comes
to
that
if
you
decline
to
give
effect
to
the
colorado
river
compact,
we
say
that
justiciability
that's
found
here
must
be
upon
a
theory
of
this
case
entirely
different
from
that
developed
here
by
the
special
master.
there
is
no
quarrel
with
any
arizona
project.
this
case
wouldn't
be
here
except
for
the
demand
for
the
proposed
central
arizona
project
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
no.
well,
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
permit
me
to
make
that
very
plain.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
any
existing
or
authorized,
presently
authorized
arizona
or
nevada
project.
they
are
not
using
up
the
full
quantity
to
which
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that's
a
fair
statement.
that
is
why
the
master
finds
it
justiciable.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
yes
your
honor
it
could.
it
could
in
this
sense.
if
our
opponents
are
--
really
mean
what
they
say
about
the
abundant
water
supply,
if
they
really
think
that
there
is
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
available
below
lake
mead
and
not
6
million
or
less
as
we
say,
then
they
may
exceed,
they
may
acquiesce
in
recognition
of
our
priorities
that
the
4,400,000
acre-feet
goes
here
unhurt.
there's
plenty
of
water
for
them
too
including
the
central
arizona
project
if
the
new
project
will
take
the
risk
which
every
new
project
in
the
history
of
the
west
so
far
has
had
to
take
of
the
availability
of
the
water
supply.
it
is
only
upon
the
premise
of
shortage
that
there
need
to
be
a
concern
by
the
recognition
of
our
priorities
up
to
4,400,000
feet.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
that
is
correct
but
the
solution
isn't
necessarily
one
that
says
that
yes,
we
--
arizona
goes
back
to
congress
with
a
decree
that
says
the
arizona
contract
did
too
apportion
--
reserve
water
for
us.
if
their
content
with
a
decree
that
says
that
the
priorities
of
california
up
to
4,400,000
acre-feet,
the
quantitative
limitations
are
to
be
respected
then
the
availability
of
water
for
the
central
arizona
project
depends
upon
their
convincing
somebody,
i
suppose
congress
that
enough
water
is
going
to
come
out
of
the
upper
basin
so
that
after
giving
respect
to
our
existing
priorities
there's
a
margin
for
a
new
project
and
that
is
something
i'm
very
sure
they
don't
want
to
do.
mr.
northcutt
ely
exactly.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
they
have
professed
--
excuse
me.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that's
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
we
would
be
cut
back
to
3,500,000
acre-feet
against
present
uses
of
5
million,
arizona
would
be
allowed
to
increase
from
present
uses
of
a
little
over
a
million
to
2,200,000
which
by
a
happy
coincidence
is
just
the
additional
margins
he
wants
from
the
central
arizona
project.
now,
the
master
just
doesn't
believe
our
worries
about
the
water
supply.
we
have
pending
here
a
motion
for
the
determination
of
that.
it
is
truly
inconceivable
to
me
that
the
matter
involving
the
destiny
of
these
states
be
decided
upon
any
guess
work
or
any
assertion
of
the
irrelevance
of
this
great
fact
of
life
to
how
much
water
is
there?
if
you
don't
believe
our
experts,
the
finest
in
the
land,
the
--
really,
there
never
was
such
a
battery
of
competent
men
from
both
sides
on
this
subject.
if
you
don't
believe
that,
if
you
think
that
the
water
is
going
to
be
abundant
for
the
indefinite
future
that
nothing
can
happen
until
vast
new
projects
are
built,
that
congress
has
never
even
thought
about
yet.
if
there's
that
kind
of
a
dichotomy
between
what's
real
and
what
the
world
that
might
be
then
let's
find
out
about
it
and
then
congress
is
--
as
well
as
the
court
will
have
a
firm
foundation
of
some
decisions
here.
but
you
don't
need
really
to
argue
much
about
what
the
hydrologist
would
say
if
you
look
at
the
colorado
river
compact.
if
it's
enforced,
we
can't
claim
appropriations
of
more
than
6,500,000
acre-feet
out
of
that
river.
and
if
iii
(d)
is
our
whole
water
supply,
if
we
don't
get
any
windfalls
out
of
the
upper
basin
we
can't
get
more
than
6
million
of
consumptive
use.
and
if
that's
true,
either
the
metropolitan
water
district
goes
out
of
business
or
it
doesn't.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
5
million?
mr.
northcutt
ely
right.
the
quantity
now
being
used
from
and
below
lake
mead
by
arizona,
california
and
nevada
is
of
the
general
order
of
6,000,000
acre-feet,
6,000,000
to
6,500,000.
i
do
not
have
the
precise
figure
in
mind.
but
that
is
because
the
upper
basin
is
not
developed.
the
upper
basin
depletions
of
lee
ferry
do
not
now
reduce
the
flow
there
to
75,000,000
acre-feet
for
a
decade.
the
law
will
say
then
--
has
been
110
million
that
is
11
million
acre-feet
per
year.
there
is
now
this
paradox
a
present
abundance.
there's
never
been
a
shortage
of
water
in
the
lower
basin.
there
can't
--
there
couldn't
be
before
the
colorado
river
compact.
if
equitable
apportionment
where
the
rule
unrestricted
by
the
compact
could
have
no
lawsuit,
all
of
our
projects
in
arizona,
california
and
nevada
plus
the
central
arizona
project
would
be
senior
to
projects
later
authorized
in
the
upper
basin,
no
shortage,
no
lawsuit.
the
problem
exists
because
the
colorado
river
compact
touch
right
across
this
supply
with
what
it
says
as
an
apportionment
of
perpetuity
of
the
upper
basin.
the
master
doesn't
quite
believe
that.he
says
that
these
apportionments
truly
are
nothing
but
ceilings
on
appropriations
and
if
there's
no
assurance,
these
great
projects
are
never
going
to
get
built
in
the
upper
basin.
i
--
may
i
have
the
chart
that
shows
the
14
million
(inaudible).
now,
he
said
for
example
that
there's
nothing
to
show
that
the
depletions
of
the
upper
basin
are
ever
going
to
exceed
3,840,000
acre-feet.
but
there's
water
for
--
the
metropolitan
water
district,
our
junior
project
to
the
time
of
our
children,
our
great
grandchildren,
there
never
going
to
be
a
shortage.
well,
since
last
january
when
we
argued
this
case
here,
congress
has
authorized
new
projects
in
the
upper
basin,
the
san
juan-chama
and
navajo
and
others
that
increase
depletions
to
4,500,000.
the
master
said
that
the
dixie
project
on
the
virgin
river
in
utah
hadn't
been
presented
to
congress.
it
hadn't
cleared
secretary,
there's
no
assurance
it
ever
would
and
that
consequently
this
was
the
only
utah
project
that
might
deplete
the
lower
basin
supply;
we'll
cross
that
bridge
when
we
come
to
it.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
submitted
the
dixie
project
for
authorization
to
congress.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
closed
reclaiming
gorged
dams
since
we
were
here
last
january
into
stored
water.
the
glen
canyon
dam
would
be
closed
in
february
to
start
to
store
water.
these
great
upper
basin
dams
will
accumulate
35,000,000
acre-feet
of
storage.
if
they
did
it
at
a
rate
of
--
if
it
took
30
years
to
do
it,
that's
over
a
1
million
acre-feet
a
year
of
depletions.
by
the
time
the
reservoirs
are
full,
20-30
years
from
now
at
that
rate,
the
projects
now
authorized
in
the
upper
basin
will
be
fully
operative,
upper
basin
depletions
will
surely
never
be
less
than
5,000,000
acre-feet
and
they'll
gradually
rise.
we
offer
to
prove
in
our
motion
now
pending
before
you
that
by
1990,
28
years
from
now,
by
the
time
these
upper
basin
reservoirs
are
full,
the
permanent
upper
basin
depletions
would
be
of
the
order
of
6,200,000
acre-feet.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
map
--
of
the
chart
behind
me,
you'll
see
the
range
of
estimates
of
the
water
supply.
the
maximum
that
can
be
hoped
for
is
15,200,000
acre-feet
of
lee
ferry
if
we
had
a
repetition
of
all
the
wonderful
estimated
years
when
there
are
no
gauges,
the
minimum
is
13,100,000,
this
is
how
much
water
would've
been
there
and
had
there
been
no
upper
basin
depletions
at
all.
the
range
is
somewhere
between
those.
now,
at
that
time,
we
were
here
in
january,
the
upper
basin
depletions
authorized
were
3,900,000
and
we
subtracted
those
from
the
water
supply,
they
showed
that
they
had
a
margin
for
upper
basin
expansion
of
1,300,000
acre-feet.
in
the
event
the
undepleted
or
diversion
flow
which
is
great
in
the
future
is
15,200,000.
if
it's
as
low
as
13,100,000,
we
already
pay
some
shortage.
since
that
time,
the
upper
basin
depletions
authorized
by
congress
have
increased
to
4,500,000
and
the
gates
are
now
shut
upon
their
--
the
first
of
the
great
storage
dams.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
your
honor
but
by
the
time
the
upper
basin
reservoirs
are
filled,
by
the
time
they've
accumulated
their
35,000,000,
the
depletions
will
be
at
this
rate
according
to
bureau
of
reclamation's
program
of
construction.
mr.
northcutt
ely
less
than
that.
we
offer
to
prove
that
by
1990,
28
years
from
now,
the
permanent
upper
basin
depletions
according
to
reclamation
bureau's
forecast
would
be
6,200,000
acre-feet.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
the
flow
at
lee
ferry
will
be
depleted
by
that
quantity.
i'm
not
speaking
now
of
consumptive
use,
diversions
less
returns
but
in
the
diminution
of
our
supply
at
lee
ferry.
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me.
mr.
northcutt
ely
for
the
lower
basin?
if
the
flow
of
the
so-called
virgin
flow
at
--
to
lee
fairy,
assume
it
would
13,000,000
you
subtract
six,
we'd
have
something
like
seven.
if
you
subtract
then
the
losses
from
lee
ferry
to
mexico,
it
would
be
about
six.
now
that's
not
any
provision
for
mexico
at
all.
i
don't
know
where
the
mexican
water
had
come
from.
if
it
--
it
might
have
to
be
meant
by
further
reduction
of
our
residue
of
6,000,000.
if
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
have
a
virgin
flow
of
15,200,000
and
the
depletions
were
6,200,000,
it
leaves
nine.
and
out
of
that
nine,
we'd
have
to
come
the
losses
below
of
1
million
getting
us
down
to
eight
and
somewhere
the
water
from
mexico
has
to
be
found.
i
cannot
--
may
i
have
this
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
at
about
19
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
--
well,
i
--
by
19
--
or
the
early
1970's,
if
the
decree
becomes
operative
and
the
central
arizona
project
is
built.
as
soon
as
that
project
is
operative
and
assuming
the
upper
basin
depletions
proceed
at
the
rate
we
forecast,
the
metropolitan's
supply
would
be
half
lost
in
the
early
1970's
and
totally
lost
by
1990.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
if
i
may
comment
on
the
two
halves
of
that.
first,
if
i
may
say
so
respectfully
your
honor,
it's
not
a
long
time.
this
court
has
said
that
in
the
case
of
economy,
light
and
power
company,
that
a
hundred
years
there's
a
short
time
in
the
history
of
a
nation
and
so
it
is.
28
years
is
less
than
the
time
and
has
gone
by
since
the
signature
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
it
is
less
than
the
time
that
the
boulder
canyon
project
has
been
operative.
great
projects
must
be
built
for
a
quarter
century,
a
half
century
in
the
future
or
they
suffer
the
fate
of
new
york
city
which
has
to
ration
the
water
because
it
didn't
do
it,
or
we'd
still
have
to
ration
water.
28
years
is
a
short
time.
it
takes
years
upon
years
to
construct
these
great
projects
and
to
say
that
we
shall
be
entirely
out
of
water,
in
the
metropolitan
water
district
in
a
period
as
long
as
28
years
is
not
very
reassuring.
second,
as
to
what
the
alternative
sources
are
available,
i
say
to
you,
your
honor
this
is
completely
outside
the
scope
of
this
lawsuit.
and
as
to
rejected
evidence
upon
it,
correctly.
he
said,
if
we're
going
to
try
the
issue
of
desalting
the
sea
or
bringing
water
from
the
columbia
or
from
the
rivers
in
northern
california,
we
have
some
bigger
lawsuits
than
the
one
you've
got
now
and
that's
true.
there
is
no
evidence
on
that
subject
that
the
master
took
cognizance
of
and
none
that
we
feel
you
should
take
cognizance
of.
the
question
now
is,
what
are
the
water
rights
--
what
is
the
agreement
made
by
california
with
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
1929
upon
which
we
have
invested
our
$500
million
by
which
we
support
our
8
million
people?
not
--
what
can
we
do
if
we
abandon
that
aqueduct
to
the
sun,
how
can
we
do
something
else
about
it?
nobody's
offered
to
pay
for
the
alternative
source
that
would
take
our
water
to
give
it
to
the
central
arizona
project.
it's
outside
the
scope
of
this
case
if
i
may
respectfully
say
so.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
i
first
want
to
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
first
want
to
give
this
hedge,
your
honor
if
i
understood
his
question
properly.
it
was
--
what
is
the
aggregate
of
the
present
--
existing
project's
claims
against
the
river?
and
that
aggregate
of
the
claims
of
existing
projects
is
not
in
excess
of
the
supply.
it
is
the
pressure
for
a
new
central
arizona
project
that
brings
this
case
here
at
all.
the
existing
supply
given
6
million
acre-feet
if
it's
reduced
to
that
would
approximate
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon?
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
and
which
is
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
real
controversy
is,
shall
water
be
found
for
the
proposed
central
arizona
project
at
the
expense
of
existing
california
projects.
it's
the
only
reason
we're
here.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
area
above
the
lee
ferry
in
the
--
in
arizona
is
accommodated
by
the
compact
among
the
upper
basin
states
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
which
provides
that
50,000
acre-feet
as
apportioned
to
arizona
for
that
--
in
the
consequence
of
that
area
in
the
upper
basin.
it's
geographically
so
located
that
i
don't
think
any
major
diversion
could
take
place
there.
if
it
does,
then
to
the
extent
of
50,000
acre-feet,
the
upper
states
would
acquiesce
then.
that's
chargeable
there
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
your
honor,
i
think
i
have
fairly
referred
to
our
position
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
section
4
(a)
and
i
went
into
that
at
great
length
when
i
was
here
before.
i
want
to
summarize
it
very
briefly.
first,
before
i
do
i've
been
reminded
that
i
did
not
fully
answer
one
question
here
as
to
what
would
happen
if
california,
i
said
a
minute
ago
that
if
california
prevailed
on
both
the
priority
issue
and
the
limitation
issue
that
i'm
going
to
briefly
discuss
now,
we'd
get
4,600,000
acre-feet
out
of,
let's
say
6
million.
if
we
prevail
only
upon
the
priority
issue,
that
is
to
say
if
you
sustain
our
priorities
up
to
the
quantitative
ceiling
of
4,400,000
acre-feet
then
there
being
6
million
acre-feet
available
i'll
assume,
arizona
and
nevada
would
have
1,600,000
acre-feet
about
a
half
million
acre-feet
more
than
they
used
last
year.
in
other
words,
there
would
be
that
quantity
available
for
any
project
they
want
to
use
it
on.
if
you
decide
with
us
on
priorities
but
if
you
reject
the
limitation
argument
that
i'm
about
to
make,
if
you
accept
both
of
them
then
against
a
supply
of
6
million
acre-feet
we'd
get
the
4,600,000,
i'm
not
sure.
now
also,
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
if
there's
as
much
as
7,500,000
acre-feet
below
lake
mead
which
means
more
than
10
million
flowing
in
at
lee
ferry
then
happily,
we'd
get
as
much
as
5,400,000
acre-feet
in
arizona
and
nevada
to
get
2,100,000,
plenty
of
water
for
everybody.
we'd
get
our
full
supply
for
our
projects
and
they
would
get
2,100,000,
a
million
more
than
they're
now
using
in
the
middle
--
central
arizona
project
but
to
get
into
that
happy
state,
we
have
to
have
at
lee
ferry
more
than
10
million
acre-feet
and
the
upper
basin
has
to
reduce
its
uses
to
not
over
a
3
million
or
4
million
acre-feet
not
the
7,500,000
they
thought
they
got
under
the
compact.
what
were
the
realistic
supply
here
is
of
the
order
of
6,000,000
to
6,500,000
acre-feet,
weren't
nearly
six.
mr.
northcutt
ely
from
--
from
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
in
the
red
river
that
the
master
uses,
lake
mead
to
mexico.
mr.
northcutt
ely
let
me
back
up.
let
me
back
up
your
honor.
there
is
not
more
--
let
us
say
6
million
acre-feet
to
avoid
two
figures.
6
million
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
available
in
the
lower
basin
under
the
terms
of
the
compact
from
the
main
river,
lee
ferry
to
mexico,
lee
ferry
to
mexico.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
to
the
extent
that
this
is
consumed
between
lee
ferry
and
lake
mead
as
that
much
less
below
lake
mead.
mr.
northcutt
ely
arizona
is
now
using
a
little
over
a
million.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
and
let
me
make
this
clear,
your
honor.
i
should've
done
this
of
course.
when
i
say
that
--
if
you
agree
with
us,
they
would
have
a
1,400,000
acre-feet,
i
mean
out
of
the
main
river
plus
the
tributaries
and
all
the
tributaries
sustained
consumptive
uses
of
about
2
million
acre-feet.
so
if
you're
allocating
the
waters
of
the
lower
basin
which
you
are
or
new
mexico
and
utah
wouldn't
be
here
because
they
use
only
the
tributaries
and
they
were
--
and
pleaded
here,
if
you're
allocating
the
waters
of
the
lower
basin
including
the
tributaries
then
arizona's
share
if
we
prevail
on
all
issues
is
not
only
of
about
a
1,300,000
out
of
the
main
river
but
2,000,000
on
the
tributaries
or
nearly
that,
the
1,700,000
let
us
say,
3
million
altogether.
now,
briefly
on
this
question
of
the
limitation
issue,
what
it
boils
down
to
is
simply
this.
in
our
agreement
with
congress,
when
we
restricted
our
uses
to
4,400,000
acre-feet
plus
half
of
the
excess
or
surplus
of
the
waters
available
to
the
lower
basin
under
the
colorado
river
compact
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
thank
you.
mr.
northcutt
ely
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
going
to
ask
to
--
pardon
me,
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
except
for
two
points.
one,
in
response
to
the
questions
from
mr.
justice
white
with
respect
to
water
supply
in
effect
to
the
compact,
i
should
like
very
earnestly
to
ask
your
attention
to
our
opening
brief
at
page
a39
to
a62
which
contains
our
motion
to
reopen
the
trial
for
the
taking
of
evidence,
re:
the
depletion
of
the
colorado
river
at
lee
ferry
by
the
upper
basin
and
the
statement
in
support
of
motion.
that
gives
the
statistics.
the
water
supply
calculations
are
in
part
five
of
that
same
brief,
our
opening
brief
which
is
dated
may
22,
1961,
commencing
at
page
232.
the
argument
on
the
limitation
matter,
that
is
the
construction
of
section
4
(a),
i
covered
it
at
great
length
in
january
and
it
is
summarized
or
stated
with
--
in
our
brief,
our
opening
brief,
the
same
one,
at
pages
69
to
137
and
i
shall
simply
identify
that
issue
without
arguing
in
the
detail.
the
issue
is
simply
this.
whether
the
reference
to
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact
in
the
section
4
(a)
which
imposed
the
limitation
which
we
accepted
meant
what
it
said,
which
means
in
substance
that
the
3,100,000
acre-feet
and
half
of
the
excess
from
which
california
is
excluded
shall
be
supplied
from
the
system
or
does
it
mean
as
the
master
says
that
this
reference
was
inappropriate
and
that
the
water
from
which
we're
excluded
may
all
be
claimed
from
lake
mead.
that
is
covered
in
detail
in
this
brief.
we
say
that
when
we
ratified
simultaneously,
in
effect
two
compacts;
one,
the
colorado
river
compact
and
the
other,
the
agreement
with
congress,
evidenced
by
the
limitation
act,
both
in
--
which
is
in
compact
terms
and
indeed
makes
three
cross
references
with
the
compact,
we
cannot
be
assumed
to
have
ratified
on
the
--
simultaneously
two
agreements
with
such
diametrically
inconsistent
meaning
of
the
same
terms.
and
that
both
of
them
refer
to
the
quantity
of
water
available
to
the
lower
basin
under
the
colorado
river
compact,
article
iii
(a)
and
it
was
intended
that
california
should
have
4,400,000
acre-feet
when
the
lower
basin
is
using
seven
and
a
half
million
from
the
main
river
plus
the
tributaries.
it
does
not
mean
as
the
master
would
have
it
mean
that
even
if
the
lower
basin
is
using
its
entire
apportionment,
seven
and
a
half
million
plus
indeed
the
million
referred
to
in
iii
(b)
from
the
main
river,
from
the
tributaries,
we
can't
have
4,400,000
acre-feet,
we
can
have
3,800,000.
we
say
we
relied
upon
that
bargain.
they
have
carried
it
out.
the
master
conceded
in
the
oral
argument
in
new
york
that
the
interpretation
he
now
gives,
that
the
reference
to
the
compact
doesn't
mean
the
compact
that
the
argument
is
not
what
the
colorado
river
compact
means
but
whether
the
reference
is
inappropriate.
he
concedes
that
is
an
issue
not
litigated
at
all
--
for
the
first
time
in
his
draft
report
and
indeed
was
--
as
we're
candid
just
to
say
that
if
we
were
issuing
patents
upon
it,
he
would
have
to
claim
novelty.
we
say
that
the
metropolitan
water
district,
having
built
its
great
aqueduct
in
reliance
upon
a
bargain
between
our
state
and
congress,
evidenced
by
the
limitation
act
is
not
to
be
destroyed
by
the
discovery
of
a
patentable
novelty.
it's
bad
enough
to
encounter
a
proration
formula
devised
by
the
secretary
three
years
after
our
projects
were
completed.
it
set
much
worse
to
be
destroyed
by
a
patentable
novelty
discovered
in
1960.
we
say
the
limitation
means
what
it
says.
we
have
carried
out
our
bargain.
we
intended
to
be
limited
by
it.
we
ask
the
right
to
occupy
it
to
defense,
the
limit
established
by
the
limitation
act.
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
would
--
if
there's
six
million
available,
then
there's
a
shortage
of
a
million
and
a
half.
we
would
bear
44
seventy-fifths
of
that
shortage
and
we
would
have
available
a
net
of
three
and
a
half
million
according
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
we
should
--
they'd
be
entitled
to
claim
up
to
our
4,400,000.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
there,
there
were
no
shortage
at
all,
if
there
were
seven
and
a
half
million
acre-feet,
he
would
still
give
us
only
4,400,000.
if
we're
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
let
me
put
in
this
perspective;
if
you
agree
with
us
on
the
limitation
issue
that
the
fund
of
water
to
be
divided
includes
the
tributaries,
then
there
is
an
--
probably
no
question
of
shortage,
i
say
probably,
because
a
2
million
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
sustained
by
the
tributaries,
when
added
to
the
6
million
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
of
the
main
river
will
sustain,
makes
8
million.
that
is
500,000
in
excess
of
the
total
iii
(a)
apportionment
to
the
lower
basin
and
if
we
are
correct,
then
you
have
a
fund
of
water
of
8
million
to
divide,
not
6
million.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
would
have
4,400,000
plus
half
of
the
excess
above
seven
and
a
half
million
or
the
half
of
500,000
or
about
4,650,000.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
if
you
disagree
with
us
on
the
limitation
issue
in
hold
with
him
and
hold
that
arizona's
--
nevada's
3,100,000
from
which
we
are
excluded
of
iii
(a)
water
can
all
be
claimed
from
the
red
river,
lake
mead
and
below
then
there's
an
inevitable
shortage.
and
the
total
supplies
of
the
order
of
six
million
to
sustain
this
claim
for
not
less
that
seven
and
a
half.
mr.
northcutt
ely
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
with
the
respect
to
some
of
the
points
made
by
mr.
wilmer.
mr.
northcutt
ely
so
i'm
informed.
mr.
wilmer
has
submitted
to
the
court
a
set
of
tables
indicating
the
quantity
of
water
he
believes
california
could
survive
on.
this
problem
is
litigated
for
several
weeks.
arizona
decided
to
submit
no
findings
or
conclusions
upon
it.
we
did,
the
arizona
decision
apparently
was
made
after
mr.
ryder,
the
chief
planning
program
engineer
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation
may
have
gave
the
testimony
which
has
been
reproduced
and
submitted
to
you
in
which
he
classified
the
imperial
irrigation
district's
efficiency
as
being
near
the
top
of
those
of
all
of
the
reclamation
projects.
we
will
cheerfully
accept
any
probation
under
the
decree
that
enforces
conservation
of
water
on
both
sides
of
the
river
and
by
the
same
standard
where
you
think
it
as
an
appropriate
provision
of
a
decree.
if
it
were
so
enforced,
arizona
would
have
to
cut
back
drastically
upon
the
quantity
she
diverts
per
acre
irrigated
in
arizona
because
by
the
same
testimony,
her
efficiency
is
far
less
than
ours.
mr.
wilmer
also
said
that
it
was
a
pigment
of
imagination
to
assume
that
any
diversions
were
contemplated
above
lake
mead
and
to
the
central
arizona
area.
at
page
125
of
our
opening
brief,
we
have
reproduced
a
quotation
from
the
13th
annual
report
of
the
arizona
interstate
stream
commission
dated
1960,
which
says
at
page
31
of
that
report,
“the
circulation
of
the
special
master's
draft
report
on
arizona
versus
california
et
al.
has
given
new
impetus
to
plans
for
utilizing
colorado
river
water
in
arizona.
an
integral
part
of
colorado
river
water
utilization
plants
for
central
arizona
is
a
route
for
diversion.
the
stream
commission
and
the
united
states
geological
survey
have
undertaken
a
cooperative
program
to
map
the
unsurveyed
area
which
would
be
traversed
by
a
proposed
diversion
route
from
marble
canyon
which
on
the
map
as
you
will
see
is
above
lake
mead,
where
the
mapping
program
nearing
completion,
detailed
cost
estimates
can
be
made
which
will
facilitate
consideration
of
the
relative
desirability
of
this
diversion
route
to
central
arizona.”
this
is
not
a
pigment
of
imagination.
how
the
choice
of
routes
will
ultimately
be
resolved,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
legott
also
indicated
that
--
oh
pardon
me
--
mr.
wilmer
also
indicated
that
central
arizona
was
in
arduous
rates
through
the
dropping
of
its
water
tables
and
indicated
that
we
were
pleading
to
this
court
on
a
poor
mouth
basis
as
he
called
it
and
he
would
do
likewise.
that
is
not
the
case.
we
do
not
ask
here
for
sympathy
or
mercy
for
any
of
the
states.
we
do
ask
that
the
project
act
be
interpreted
as
we
think
it
was
designed
to
be
interpreted
and
shall
not
be
rewritten
in
the
light
of
an
administrative
contract
made
in
1944,
our
contract,
our
bargain
was
made
in
1929.
but
as
long
as
this
subject
is
raised,
i
should
like
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
their
draft
report
or
the
report
of
the
special
master
contains
tables
prepared
by
an
expert
arizona
witness
and
mr.
legott
of
the
valley
national
bank,
designed
to
show
the
explosive
growth
in
that
state.
mr.
legott
is
the
author
of
an
article
in
the
arizona
highways
in
february
-
march
1962,
an
official
publication
of
the
state
of
arizona
in
which
this
rather
candid
witness
in
this
case,
more
recently,
has
expressed
himself
as
follows.
“the
important
arizona's
location
in
one
of
the
most
arid
section
of
the
united
states
often
goes
rise
to
questions
as
to
whether
its
water
supply
is
sufficient
to
permit
a
substantial
population
growth.
the
question
can
be
answered
quite
specifically
and
simply,
and
the
answer
is
definitely,
yes.
the
important
point
to
bear
in
mind
is
the
distinction
between
water
for
agricultural
purposes
and
water
for
domestic
purposes.
in
the
latter
of
the
respect,
there
is
no
water
problem
in
the
lowland
areas
of
arizona.
arizona's
water
resources
are
ample
to
support
at
least
10
to
15
times
the
present
population,
i.e.
a
population
even
larger
than
that
of
california.
in
the
process,
this
would
probably
mean
that
phoenix
larger
than
los
angeles
varies
the
thought”
says,
mr.
legott,
“and
the
tucson
larger
than
san
francisco.
in
all
seriousness,
arizona's
water
supply
for
normal,
domestic
and
industrial
usage
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
country,
although…”
--
and
he
goes
on
with
the
quantities
required.
thus,
arizona's
present
population
of
approximately
1,400,000
consumes
approximately
175,000
acre-feet
of
water
per
annum,
which
is
about
the
same
amount
as
waters
would
normally
be
utilized
on
60,000
acres
of
irrigated
cropland.
stated
in
other
way,
the
present
domestic
consumption
of
water
in
arizona
is
less
than
5%
of
the
amount
used
for
agricultural
purposes
and
much
of
it
actually
finds
its
way
back
into
the
underground
of
reservoirs
for
reuse.
and
he
goes
on
to
say
at
the
conclusion
of
this
paragraph,
whenever
a
cow
pasture
or
citrus
grove
is
converted
into
a
residential
subdivision,
there's
both
the
saving
in
water
and
a
tremendous
property
increase.
so
we're
confronted
here
with
a
--
whether
the
economy
of
central
arizona
based
largely
upon
cotton
shall
continue
by
--
or
whether
it
shall
be
gradually
converted
as
we
have
had
to
do
in
southern
california
by
pulling
up
our
beautiful
orange
groves
and
converting
them
to
the
support
of
the
exploding
population
there.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
hope
not,
your
honor.
too
many
of
them
have
disappeared
already.
but
both
states
are
faced
with
an
exploding
population,
we
realize
that
that
is
not
the
necessary
basis
of
decision
here.
now,
as
to
the
limitation
issue
upon
which
both
mr.
wilmer
and
mr.
cox
said
well,
the
words
in
the
section
4
(a),
the
first
paragraph,
a
proposal
to
california
are
clear.
a
reference
is
to
4,400,000
acre-feet
of
the
waters
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
states
by
paragraph
of
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
compact.
we
say
that
the
project
act
intended
by
that
to
incorporate
the
compact
whatever
it
might
mean.
the
congress
knew
that
tributaries
were
included
in
the
compact.
sections
13,
13
(b),
13
(c),
13
(d)
specifically
provide
that
the
united
states
and
all
those
claiming
under
the
united
states
shall
conform
to
the
compact
and
that
this
compact
shall
be
impressed
upon
the
main
river
and
its
tributaries.
the
compact
included
the
tributaries,
congress
knew
that,
the
master
so
recognizes.
and
it's
important
perhaps
that
in
1941
when
congress
enacted
the
boulder
canyon
project
adjustment
act,
it
specified
that
section
18
of
which
you've
heard
here
and
these
same
sections
13
(b),
13
(c)
and
13
(d)
should
be
reenacted.
the
master
has
made
one
of
his
--
the
master
has
made
one
of
his
few
factual
errors
in
his
report
in
which
he
states
that
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
at
the
time
of
the
project
act
or
indeed
since
1928,
the
imperial
irrigation
district
had
used
the
waters
of
the
gila
river.
elsewhere
in
his
report,
he
states
the
facts
correctly
that
from
1901
to
1941
appeared
40
years,
the
diversion
point
for
the
imperial
canal
was
below
the
gila
river
and
the
gila
was
used
by
the
imperial.
but
this
fact
was
brought
home
to
congress
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
delph
carpenter,
the
principal
author
of
the
colorado
river
compact,
and
if
you'll
bear
with
me,
i
will
quote
a
couple
of
paragraphs
from
his
testimony
on
this
specific
subject
as
to
why
the
upper
basin
as
well
california
wherein
it
rested
in
the
inclusion
of
the
gila
in
the
county.
mr.
carpenter
told
a
committee
of
congress
in
1926,
the
gila
river
is
not
exclusively
--
exclusively
an
arizona
stream
even
in
the
matter
of
origin.
secondly,
the
gila
and
every
other
river,
mentioned,
contributes
if
uninterrupted,
its
water
supply
to
the
main
river
above
the
largest
diversion
canal
in
america,
the
imperial
valley
canal
heading
now
below
yuma.
gila
water
is
of
importance
to
the
imperial
valley
canal.
the
canal
naturally
looks
to
the
more
stable
flow
from
the
main
river
but
i'm
informed
that
gila
water
is
frequently
diverted
and
it
has
been
my
privilege
to
see
water
coming
from
the
gila
river
and
flowing
into
the
colorado
and
down
into
the
imperial
valley
canal.
that
water
is
just
as
wet
and
just
as
serviceable
as
the
water
from
the
green
river
in
utah.
the
waters
of
the
gila
river
are
waters
of
the
colorado
river
just
as
much
as
the
waters
of
the
green
river.
so
that
when
you
look
at
these
facts
squarely,
you
were
brought
to
the
proposition
that
there
is
not
a
single
tributary
of
the
entire
colorado
river
that
does
not
enter
the
river
above
yuma
and
the
greatest
diverter
from
this
river
or
from
any
river
in
america
or
the
world
as
the
canal
of
imperial
valley
located
below
yuma.
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
they
thought
this
advance
that
the
imperial
district
will
move
its
point
of
diversion
above
yuma
and
therefore
with
gila
no
longer
be
of
interest
to
it.
but
he
says
a
canal
for
the
irrigation
of
lands
in
mexico
would
head
below
the
mouth
of
the
gila.the
whole
theory
of
the
laguna
dam
connection
is
founded
upon
an
all-american
canal.
then
he
concludes
by
saying,
“i'm
going
into
this
matter
because
there
seems
to
be
an
idea
or
a
dream
that
the
gila
is
not
a
tributary.
an
idea
that
because
the
all-american
canal
will
ultimately
hook
up
with
the
laguna
dam
that
therefore
the
gila
is
a
river
unto
itself.
senator
phipps
of
colorado
having
heard
the
debate
in
which
senator
pittman
and
senator
hayden
participated
and
reported
to
the
senate,
the
upper
basin
governors'
recommendations
obviously
were
concerned
about
the
confusion
that
the
master
has
pointed
out
in
his
report.
now,
we
come
to
the
phipps
amendment
in
just
a
moment.
but
at
page
189
and
page
190,
the
master
points
out
that
senator
pittman
in
reporting
to
the
senate,
the
recommendation
of
the
governors
in
their
1927
conference
was
confused.
the
governors
were
recommending
a
division
of
the
water
let
down
at
lee
ferry
that
is
flow
not
consumptive
use.
flow
of
the
stream
not
consumptive
use
as
the
master
would
allocate.
this
--
says
the
master,
this
report
by
senator
pittman
did
not
adopt
or
perhaps
failed
to
grasp
that
portion
of
the
governors'
resolution
which
expressly
found
the
source
of
the
allocated
waters
in
the
article
iii
(d)
obligation
of
the
upper
division.
instead,
senator
pittman
related
the
limitation
to
article
3
(a)
not
3
(d)
as
appears
from
the
very
next
sentence
of
his
statement
which
reads
as
follows
and
he
quotes
it.
on
page
190,
the
master
continues,
“thus
senator
pittman
use
article
iii
(a)
to
define
the
area
against
which
the
limitation
was
to
operate.
he
did
this
in
apparent
misunderstanding
of
the
governor's
recommendation.
all
subsequent
discussion
in
the
senate
flowed
in
the
same
channel.”
now,
shall
we
be
held
to
the
bargain
which
the
california
legislature
enacted
in
response
to
plain
language
of
an
act
of
congress
or
shall
be
held
of
the
confusion
entertained
by
one
senator,
and
so
described
by
the
master.
senator
phipps
of
colorado
was
the
chairman
of
the
reporting
committee.
he
was
the
author
of
the
limitation
and
he
was
obviously
concerned
by
this
growing
confusion
because
senator
phipps
offered
a
perfecting
amendment
to
his
own
limitation
which
at
the
time
read
4,600,000
acre-feet.
the
circumstances
are
cited
in
our
opening
brief
at
page
118.
senator
phipps
said,
“referring
to
the
amendment
which
is
now
before
the
senate
that
was
the
committee
amendment
which
imposed
the
limitation
of
4,600,000
acre-feet.”
referring
to
the
amendment
which
is
now
before
--
and
pardon
me,
4,400,000
--
it
had
already
been
voted
upon
4,600,000
versus
4,200,000
had
been
settled
upon
as
4,400,000.
referring
to
the
amendment
which
is
now
before
the
senate,
in
order
to
remove
any
possible
misunderstanding
regarding
the
4,400,000
acre-feet
of
water,
i
desire
to
perfect
the
amendment
by
inserting
on
page
3,
line
4
after
the
word
“by”,
the
words
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of,
so
that
it
will
show
that
that
allocation
of
water
refers
directly
to
the
seven
and
one
half
million
acre-feet
of
water
that
are
mentioned
in
paragraph
3.
senator
phipps'
perfecting
amendment
was
accepted
without
objection
and
thereafter,
the
phipps
amendment,
the
4,400,000
acre-feet
in
it,
instead
4,600,000
was
adapted
by
the
senate.
there
cannot
be
a
more
explicit
clarification.
this
did
not
come
early
in
the
debate
as
the
solicitor
general
is
mistaken
in
believing.
this
was
virtually
the
last
utterance
before
the
limitation
amendment
was
adopted.
it
was
approved
by
the
senate
upon
that
understanding
which
identified
the
7,500,000
million
acre-feet
with
iii
(a)
which
includes
the
tributaries
and
cleared
up
the
misunderstanding,
the
confusion,
as
the
master
calls
it,
senator
pittman
and
senator
hayden
that
the
limitation
related
to
the
flow
of
the
stream
at
lee
ferry,
the
iii
(d)
obligation.
now,
it
is
clear,
however,
that
senator
hayden
was
not
demanding
from
the
senate,
2,800,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use,
diversions,
less
returns
to
the
stream
at
all.
senator
hayden
was
consistent
in
relating
the
divisional
water
that
he
proposed
to
the
flow
of
the
stream,
the
iii
(d)
delivery
of
lee
ferry.
senator
hayden,
three
times,
told
the
senate
that
if
arizona
were
permitted
to
divert
2,800,000
acre-feet
for
the
proposed
parker-gila
project,
some
944,000
acre-feet
of
that
when
returned
to
the
stream
be
capable
of
use
only
by
mexico
and
that
arizona
claim
no
credit
for
that
return
flow.
here
is
his
specific
language.
he
is
referring
to
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
(a).
he
has
first
described
that
the
2,800,000
--
2,844,000
be
diverted
for
this
specific
project,
the
parker-gila
project
that
the
experts
have
testified
the
948,000
acre-feet
of
the
return
flow
and
he
nails
it
down
with
this
statement:
“i
have
specified
in
the
amendment
which
i
have
offered
that
the
state
of
arizona
lays
no
claim
to
that
return
flow.
we
do
not
ask
to
have
any
credit
for
it
after
it
arises
in
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river.
it
will
be
surplus
and
unappropriated
waters
which
arizona
cannot
use
and
that
water
and
that
alone
will
be
sufficient
to
supply
any
demand
for
water
to
meet
the
existing
uses
in
mexico.”
the
master
in
other
words
awards
to
arizona
by
definition
of
the
2,800,000
acre-feet
as
diversions
less
returns
consumptive
use.
some
948,000
acre-feet
more
than
senator
hayden
explained
to
the
senate,
he
expected
to
get.senator
hayden
was
consistent
in
his
confusion.
he
identified
at
all
times
the
allocation,
the
division
he
thought
would
be
accomplished
by
section
4
(a)
to
the
flow
of
the
river,
the
flow
at
lee
ferry
and
not
the
consumptive
use
diversions
less
returns.
only
by
this
explanation
of
senator
hayden,
can
you
possibly
reconcile
the
arithmetic
of
section
4
(a)
with
the
arithmetic
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
senator
pittman
obviously
was
not
content
to
leave
this
kind
of
confusion
in
the
record,
the
man
responsible
for
the
act,
he
straightened
it
out
with
his
perfecting
amendment
in
california
accepted
the
limitation
in
the
light
of
the
phipps
perfecting
amendment.
nowhere
did
anybody
propose
a
vote
upon
an
amendment
which
would
substitute
for
4,600,000
or
4,200,000
or
4,400,000,
an
authorization
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
reduce
that
figure
to
44
seventy-fifths
of
x
what
the
secretary
might
elect
to
release.
to
the
contrary,
senator
johnson
was
explicit
in
stating
to
the
senate
that
the
--
that
we
were
dealing
with
an
irreducible
minimum
in
california.
at
70
congressional
record
385,
senator
johnson
said
this,
“i
say
to
the
gentleman
of
arizona,
you
say
the
california
shall
have
a
4,200,000
acre-feet,
we
say
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
francis
wilson
is
the
best
upon
that
subject”
--
pardon
me,
“that
the
irreducible
minimum
of
the
state
of
california
is
4,600,00
acre-feet.
you
say
there
was.
you
must
bind
your
people
for
all
time
in
the
future
and
never
to
go
beyond
it
by
this
amendment.
the
amendment
does
not
divide
the
water
between
arizona
and
california.
it
fixes
a
maximum
amount
of
beyond
reach
california
cannot
go.”
now,
with
respect
to
the
priority
issue,
section
14
is
explicit
in
incorporating
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
the
terms
of
the
reclamation
law.section
8
of
the
reclamation
law
has
been
fully
debated
here.
it
provides
that
the
--
that
the
beneficial
use
should
be
the
basis
of
measure
in
the
limit
of
the
right.
section
5
is
subject
to
section
14.
the
united
states
in
its
brief
does
not
characterize
the
arizona
project
as
a
section
5
water
delivery
contract.
to
the
contrary,
the
united
states
says
in
its
answering
brief
at
page
47,
“it
is
our
understanding
that
this
contract
with
arizona
does
not
by
itself
authorize
the
actual
delivery
of
water
in
compliance
with
section
5
of
the
project
act,
since
that
section
requires
that
the
contracts
be
entered
into
with
the
actual
users
of
the
water,
rather,
this
contract
is
in
the
nature
of
a
commitment
by
the
secretary
to
enter
into
the
contracts
with
users
in
arizona
up
to
the
limit
of
2,800,000
acre-feet.
in
this
sense,
it
is
an
allocation
by
the
secretary
of
that
amount
of
water
for
a
future
contractual
use.”
we
say
that
neither
section
5
nor
any
other
section
authorizes
the
secretary
of
interior
to
make
any
such
interstate
apportionment,
any
such
allocation
for
future
use.
and
indeed
arizona,
in
her
brief,
opposing
the
theory
of
the
united
states
that
the
secretary
or
the
creation
of
an
indian
reservation,
somehow
reserves
water,
it
calls
the
attention
to
section
8.
and
arizona's
opening
brief
at
page
144
says
this,
“section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
also
proscribes
that
beneficial
use
shall
be
the
basis,
the
measure
and
the
limit
of
the
right.”
“this
requirement,”
says
arizona
“cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
concept
that
a
water
right
maybe
acquired
by
a
reservation
without
any
physical
application
of
water
to
have
beneficial
use.”
if
that
is
true
with
respect
to
the
federal
indian
law,
it
is
surely
true
with
respect
to
the
federal
reclamation
law
in
which
section
8
appears
and
which
is
incorporated
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
mr.
northcutt
ely
there
are
two
prongs
to
the
equitable
apportionment
rule:
one,
priority
of
appropriation,
the
other
protection
of
existing
uses.
in
california,
we
believe
we're
protected
by
both
of
those
shields,
they
converged.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
to
the
damage
to
arizona
by
allowing
her
water
in
excess
of
the
total
requirements
over
the
existing
projects
is
nil.
we
would
grant
her
that.
we
recognize
the
priorities
of
those
projects.
the
damage
to
california
by
reducing
existing
projects
by
more
than
a
million
acre-feet
is
catastrophic.
it
is
a
result
not
required
by
the
principle
of
apportionment.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
that
is
--
with
all
due
respect,
that
is
not
our
argument.
our
point
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
i
do
not
so
read
it.
i
read
it
as
an
intention
to
protect
an
existing
economy
even
though
built
upon
a
junior
appropriation.
our
existing
economy
is
built
upon
senior
appropriations.
now,
one
word
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history,
if
the
solicitor
general
and
mr.
wilmer
are
correct,
then
the
enactment
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
was
a
tremendous
victory
for
arizona.
the
gila
was
excluded.
the
california
priorities
were
suppressed
2,800,000
acre-feet
can
be
reserved
for
use
in
arizona
in
the
indefinite
future.
what
more
could
she
want?
why
then
that
the
arizona
senators
and
congressman
vote
against
this
windfall
or
vote
against
the
bill?
why
did
arizona
bring
suit
in
this
court
to
stop
the
construction
of
the
dam?
and
why
did
senator
hayden
opposed
the
appropriation
money
to
construct
the
dam?
senator
hayden
is
perfectly
clear
on
it.
he
told
the
senate
in
1930,
when
the
first
appropriation
bill
was
up,
this:
“why
they
should
not
appropriate
money
to
build
hoover
dam?”
what
will
happen
is
that
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
will
be
impounded
in
a
boulder
canyon
reservoir
and
made
available
for
use.
large
quantities
of
water
will
be
taken
out
of
the
colorado
river
into
the
great
all-american
canal.
over
1,000,000
acre-feet
will
be
further
taken
out
of
the
river
by
a
pumping
plant
and
taken
over
into
the
coastal
plain
of
california
in
the
vicinity
of
los
angeles.
they
will
be
put
to
beneficial
use.
and
once
having
acquired
a
prior
right
to
its
use,
no
other
state
can
obtain
the
use
of
those
waters.
that
was
senator
hayden's
contemporary
appraisal
of
the
legislative
history,
what
the
senate
had
done.
that
is
not
consistent
with
a
curtailment
of
california's
rights
to
present
perfected
rights.
section
6
of
this
act
in
directing
the
secretary
to
conform,
the
article
viii
of
the
compact
is
referring
to
an
inter-basin,
an
inter-basin
agreement.
article
viii
has
no
intra-basin
effect.
the
master
says
that
the
compact
is
irrelevant
intra-basin.
section
6
rises
no
higher
than
it
source,
article
viii.
it
directs
the
secretary
to
use
this
dam
to
satisfy
present
perfected
rights
instead
of
postponing
that
lien
to
the
glen
canyon
dam
which
might
come
at
some
future
time.
now,
a
word
or
two
in
conclusion,
we
say
there
is
nothing
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
that
deprives
this
court
of
its
function,
its
jurisdiction
of
making
an
equitable
apportionment
to
decide
the
burden
of
shortages,
whether
that
burden
arises
in
a
contest
between
the
contractors
or
appropriators.
nothing
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
requires
the
destruction
of
the
--
of
the
metropolitan
water
district
act
without
everything
in
this
court's
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
forbids
that
result.
thank
you.
yes
sir?
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
the
contracts
of
california
are
long
since
made.
we
aren't
seeking
any
new
ones.
the
contracts
in
arizona
only
have
been
made
to
the
extent
of
1,100,000
acre-feet.
there's
a
1,700,000
within
the
total
of
this
contract
to
the
state
that
no
user
has
undertaken
a
contract
for.
and
i
would
regard
it
not
a
part
of
california's
problem
as
to
the
standard
to
control
the
secretary
in
making
contracts
with
individual
users
in
arizona,
except
that
consistently
with
section
5
and
section
8
of
the
reclamation
law,
he
must
make
contracts
with
individual
users
qualified
under
the
reclamation
law.
and
i
would
say
that
if
a
user,
as
appropriated
under
the
laws
of
arizona,
waters
to
be
released
in
lake
mead
and
submits
that
application
to
the
secretary
that
he
--
the
user
cannot
proceed
to
take
the
water
without
conforming
both
to
the
contract
and
to
the
state
appropriation.
that's
what
we've
done
in
california.
well
perhaps,
i
didn't
understand
it
sir.
i'll
try.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
don't
understand
(inaudible)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
do
understand
from
your
question,
sir?
you're
speaking
now
to
the
allocation
of
the
quantities
if
that's
approved,
is
there
remain
a
problem?
yes,
priorities
in
the
event
of
shortage.
mr.
northcutt
ely
priorities
in
the
event
of
shortage
remains.
if
you
sustain
the
master
upon
his
allocation
and
quantities
to
the
states,
you
nevertheless
are
faced
what
to
do
in
the
event
of
shortage
for
the
water
supply
meet
those
quantities.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
know
of
no
pending
controversy
on
that
issue,
perhaps
there
is
in
arizona
or
nevada.
there
is
none
in
california.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
apparent
cross
purposes
here
in
some
way
that
i
don't
grasp
the
implication
of
this
question.
what
i
say
is
that
in
the
event
of
--
first
of
all,
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
present
shortage
in
meeting
either
the
appropriations
or
the
contract
obligations
of
the
secretary
with
actual
users.
there
is
no
quarrel
with
any
existing
user
in
arizona.
if
hereafter
individual
contracts
are
made
within
individual
users
in
arizona
and
if
those
add
up
to
a
quantity
that
cannot
be
served
together
with
our
contracts,
then
the
question
of
shortage
does
arise
but
you
don't
reach
a
question
of
shortage
now
unless
you
attribute
to
the
arizona
contract
the
equality
that
we
say
section
8
forbids.
that
is
some
kind
of
reservation
and
apportionment
to
arizona
in
respect
of
abuse.
and
i
can't
tell
you
what
the
individual
contracts
would
be
in
arizona
to
add
up
and
by
--
with
whom
we
ultimately
be
in
conflict.
mr.
northcutt
ely
approximately
5,000,000
acre-feet.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
that
is
fixed
in
our
contracts
with
the
secretary.
the
secretary
adopted
the
state
law
schedule
of
appropriations
as
to
dates
of
priority
and
quantities.
i
should
make
this
clear
that
the
problem
of
shortage,
i
answered
your
question,
yes,
because
i
am
assuming
in
the
light
of
the
earlier
questions
that
you
are
attributing
to
the
arizona
water
contract
that
character
of
a
present
right
and
that
water
is
put
to
use
under
it
because
this
decree
would
be
taken
back
as
an
advisory
opinion
to
congress
under
which
the
central
arizona
project
be
built.
now,
if
that
project
isn't
built
then
no
shortage,
no
problem.
mr.
northcutt
ely
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
do
your
honor.
let
me
say
that
the
case
has
originally
pleaded
and
tried.
it
was
on
the
assumption
that
the
colorado
river
compact
was
relevant.
it
did
constrict
our
water
supply
as
so
constricted,
that
supply
would
not
meet
the
claims
against
it.
as
the
master
has
brought
the
report
to
you,
the
compact
is
irrelevant,
he
says,
and
we
consequently
are
dealing
with
x.
we
are
not
told
what
the
secretary
released
but
we
do
say
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
court's
equitable
apportionment
doctrine
where
our
contract
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
there
is,
your
honor,
if
you
give
to
the
arizona
contract,
a
status
of
the
reservation
the
master
has
given.
if
you
treat
the
arizona
contract
as
we
do,
as
being
ultra
vires
if
it
purports
to
make
an
interstate
apportionment,
as
simply
a
letter
of
intent
and
announcement
of
the
secretary
as
to
how
far
gila
go
like
our
limitation
act
says
in
making
individual
contracts,
then
you
don't
know
whether
there
is
a
question
of
priorities
to
deal
with
until
you
see
the
statute
that
authorizes
the
new
project
that
creates
the
shortage.
if
that
new
project
is
authorized
by
a
statute
that
respects
the
priorities
of
existing
projects,
it's
conceivable
and
if
you'll
take
the
risk
of
going
ahead,
it
might
do
so.
mr.
northcutt
ely
you're
correct.
the
master
treats
the
arizona
contract
as
a
present
reservation
and
apportionment,
a
good
in
perpetuity,
if
that
effect
is
given
to
it,
of
course
there
is
a
shortage
on
us
now
because
that
whole
quantity
is
withdrawn
from
any
stability
of
our
use.
he
gives
curiously
enough
the
effect
to
the
arizona
contract
of
a
reservation
perpetuity
that
he
denies
to
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
with
respect
to
the
upper
basin.
that
is
not
a
reservation
of
perpetuity,
the
apportionment
in
perpetuity
says
it
is.
the
arizona
contract
is
although
it
says
it's
not.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
think
what
the
secretary
should
do
and
would
do
unless
directed
otherwise
by
your
decree
is
to
tell
the
contract
holders
there's
a
shortage,
get
this
matter
determined
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
mr.
northcutt
ely
exactly
so.
mr.
northcutt
ely
exactly
so,
your
honor.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
hope
not.
mr.
northcutt
ely
your
honor,
i
didn't
say
that.
in
the
first
place,
we
don't
think
the
act
did
make
any
division.
we
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
but
your
honor
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
master,
with
reference,
did
not
say
that
the
act
could
make
a
division
of
the
water.
he
denied
that
twice.
arizona
contends
that
the
master
rejects
that
argument.
he
says
that
the
act
delegated
to
the
secretary
the
power
to
make
the
apportionment.
he
did
in
1994.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
you
honor,
again,
it
isn't
the
question
whether
contracts
governed
by
state
law.
it's
a
question
of
what
law
shall
govern
the
federal
contracts
that
the
secretary
may
make
today,
tomorrow,
next
year
with
users
in
arizona
in
the
event
of
shortage.
we
say
that
the
law
that
shall
determine
is
the
law
of
equitable
apportionment
of
section
8.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
and
we
say
that
he's
been
in
error
in
that.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
i
would
suppose
so
if
you'll
decide
all
that,
in
that
way
the
premises
(voice
overlap)
report.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i'm
sorry
if
i
failed
to
comprehend
your
question,
your
honor.
thank
you.
