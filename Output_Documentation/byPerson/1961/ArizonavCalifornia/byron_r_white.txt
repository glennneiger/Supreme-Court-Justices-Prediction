excuse
me
mr.
wilmer,
this
just
came
in,
did
it?
justice

white
the
agreement?
justice
byron

white
--
the
evolution
is
that
--
justice
byron

white
nothing
different?
justice
byron

why
are
you
keep
adding

if
there's
6
million
acre-feet
as
you
suggest
to
the
permanent
basis
and
if
the
master's
formula
is
applied,
there
will
be
water
for
the
main
central
arizona.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
water
for
metropolitan?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
would
mean
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
would
mean
what
for
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
what
point
do
you
in
time
do
you
say
the
metropolitan
water
district
would
begin
to
feel
the
depletion,
if
the
development
in
the
upper
basin
goes
on
as
you
offer
to
prove
that
it
wasn't
going
to
go
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
1963,
that
you
thought
--
justice
byron
r.
white
1970?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
really
one
more
question
though.
if
there's
--
if
you
think
the
best
guess
to
determinant
its
supply
available
below
lee
ferry
for
consumptive
use
of
6
million,
does
that
mean
that
in
terms
of
the
project
act
or
of
the
secretary's
allocation
that
there's
a
shortage
and
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there
would
have
to
be
pro
--
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
according
to
him
the
--
then
that
--
he
would
prorate
that
million
and
a
half?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
--
your
position
is
that
cali
--
that
california
have
got
senior
projects,
they
should
have
absorb
under
the
million
and
a
half?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
this
argument
--
and
this
would
have
--
that
the
question
of
priority
or
proration
would
come
up,
regardless
of
whose
right
on
the
limitations'
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
if
the
master
is
right
on
the
--
on
the
limitation,
then
the
6
million
does
mean
of
a
priority
--
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
available

(inaudible)
justice
byron

(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
master
think
that
the
applicable
rules
would
be
in
making
contracts
inside
a
state
with
water
uses?
how
was
he
to
determine,
which
users
would
get
what
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
argue
--
you
argue
in
your
brief
that
he
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
there
should
be
a
federal
rule
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
entirely
aside
from
who
may
have
originated
some
appropriative
rights
or
be
in
the
process
of
perfected
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
furthermore,
you'd
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
furthermore,
you'd
say
that
within
the
state,
he
has
the
same
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't.
but
that's
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
isn't
there
another
--
you
say
not
only
that
it's
the
secretary
who
is
to
decide,
but
that
the
rules
he
follows
are
also
his
own.
and
he
needs
not
to
have
any
reference
to
state
law
or
any
equities
that
people
within
the
state
may
have
under
their
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
of
it.
that's
all

justice

the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
they
should
be
developed.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
haven't
signed
no
contracts
for
that
water
of
course.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
water
out
of
the
tributaries?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
pay
for
water
out
of
the
tributaries.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
out
of
lake
mead?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ely.
justice
byron
r.
white
put
it
to
you
this
way.
i
gather
that
you
and
the
other
states
and
the
solicitor
general
felt
that
there
was
a
present
controversy
and
dispute
that
should
be
decided
as
to
whether
or
not
the
master
was
correct
in
determining
that
in
the
event
of
the
shortage,
there
would
be
proration
rather
than
an
allocation
by
equitable
apportionment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
is
a
very
live
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
you
lose
in
the
limitation
issue
and
that
arizona
does
have
the
water
which
the
master
says
arizona
is
entitled
to.
but
then
you
think
the
likelihood
of
a
shortage
is
enough
or
it's
imminent
enough
that
there
is
live
controversy
on
how
that
shortage
should
be
apportioned
among
the
states,
if
there
is
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
the
master
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
that
the
secretary
in
the
event
there
is
a
shortage,
if
there's
only
going
to
be
6
million
feet
of
--
reliably
available,
the
secretary
is
going
to
have
to
determine
somehow
which
contracts
he's
going
to
honor
and
which
ones
he's
not
going
to
honor.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
that
the
rule
--
that
either
he
should
follow
or
that
the
court
could
follow
is
that
of
equitable
apportionment
as
between
the
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
made
your
component
of
which
is
the
priority
doctrine.
