before
proceeding,
the
court
exceeded
to
the
request
of
the
parties
granting
the
time
which
they
asked
arguing
in
this
case
because
of
its
very
great
importance
and
the
numerous
issues
involved.
the
court,
however,
is
unanimous
of
the
opinion.
the
time
allotted
is
not
compulsory.
no
one,
no
member
of
those
attorneys,
we
decide,
needs
be
there.
that
will
be
held
against
him
if
he
filed.
we
can
discuss
his
fees
in
a
shorter
period
in
that
which
has
been
allotted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
ely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
a
little
confused
about
your
statement
with
this
respect.
what
do
you
understand,
under
the
compact,
the
amount
of
water
which
the
upper
basin
is
entitled
to
have
and
to
use
for
itself?
the
people
have
said
it's
to
the
apportionment.
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
correct
or
incorrect
in
making
it
your
argument
as
to
what
other
waters
have
you
divided
in
the
lower
basin
must
inevitably
affect
the
amount
of
water
which
the
upper
basin
can
utilize
of
itself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
exactly
how
are
we
to
accept
this
consultation
about
the
master
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
other
self
intentions
whether
you're
arguing
--
you're
making
reference
to
the
apportionment
of
the
lower
basin,
meaning
that
inevitably
you
are
bound
except
for
the
apportionment
of
seven
million
acre-feet
in
the
upper
basin
would
be
below
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
still,
it
wasn't
impaired
by
the
fact
that
he
indeed
(inaudible)
turned
back
the
subjects.
maybe
i
--
do
you
tend
to
the
fear
of
danger
in
california's
existing
conflicts
on
the
basis
that
the
upper
basin
may
use
the
water
which
is
entitled
to
you
by
the
compact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
mean
that
you
really
have
a
controversy
there
with
the
upper
basin?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
understood
--
that's
why
i
want
to
be
clearer.
what
i
understood
was,
you
mean
to
say,
they
use
that
potential,
i
presume
it
means
that
they
are
authorized
to
use
under
the
compact
and
then
california
would
suffer,
you
say,
without
the
compact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
ely,
i'll
simply
ask
you
just
to
redefine
to
permit
the
basin
--
the
upper
basin
that
you
may
be
part
of
it.
as
i
have
understood
your
argument,
a
large
part
of
it
has
been
based
on
the
upper
basin
is
entitled
to
get
--
is
or
is
not
entitled
to
get
a
certain
amount
before
it
goes
downstream.
now,
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
suppose
there
were
only
--
if
it
turned
out
to
be
only
12
million
acre-feet
available
both
below
and
above,
is
it
your
argument
that
the
upper
basin
has
to
lose
a
part
of
its
7,500,000
feet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
compact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
is
true,
can
we
decide
your
problem
without
deciding
one
way
or
the
other
on
what
the
upper
basin
is
entitled
to
receive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
to
keep.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
we
have
to
decide
that
here
as
to
what
maximum
the
upper
basin
can
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
lead
us
enough
of
this
question,
under
your
argument,
that
we
must
assume
that
it
may
be
left
and
that,
therefore,
there
must
be
some
method
of
apportioning
it
between
the
two,
either
by
the
way
the
master
has
suggested
by
his
percentage
figures
or
by
the
doctrine
of
apportionment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
referred
several
times
to
this.
the
california
existing
(inaudible)
its
capacity
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
referring
that
to
the
capacity
of
equipment
that
(inaudible)
of
appropriation
in
(inaudible)
1929?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
this
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
is
that
if
you
recall
(inaudible)
existence
1929?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
after
1929
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
goes
the
line,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
project
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
the
second
paragraph
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
meant
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
division,
was
it
not,
(inaudible)
whether
the
congress
should
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
your
position
that
they
--
they
can
not
divide
the
river?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
allocate
it
as
they
did
in
4
(b)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
(inaudible)
surplus,
it
could
be
divided
in
(inaudible),
would
be
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
this
position,
these
300,000
acre-feet,
thousand
acre-feet
above
(inaudible)?
is
that
what
you're
saying
it's
not
--
it's
not
mandatory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
it
your
position,
the
california
is
entitled
for
4,400,00,
under
any
of
one
these
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
that
california
is
bound
by
that
limitation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo

black
may
i
ask
you
that,
(inaudible)
intended
to
do
in
violate
senator
kings
(inaudible)
justice

does
that
(inaudible)
to
the
fact
that
the
secretary
was
giving
the
right
to
make
a
contract
that
should
be
finding

what

by
this
(inaudible)
in
section
5
(inaudible)
entitled

(inaudible).
justice

your
argument,

with
respect

having
provided
that
all
has

they

to
allocate

sell
the
water
at
he
saw
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
more
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
assume
how
the
congress
did
say
that
should
be
divided
to
4,400,000
(inaudible)
little
2,000,000
or
whatever
you
have
figure
(inaudible),
300,000
will
be
divided.
and
then
asking
all
the
existing
corporations
(inaudible).
then
you
say
the
act
does
not
commit
the

to
determine
to
whom
he
will
sell
that
one
over
(inaudible)
delivered.
justice

am
i
right
mr.
attorney
general?
justice
hugo

black
but
he
has
the
right

justice

he
has
the
right
under
the
bill
that
you
see,
the
power
under
the
bill
to
determine
to
whom
within
the

have

would
that
be
a
matter

that

inside

which
you

there
has
been
a
division
among
the
states

(inaudible).
justice

yes.
justice
hugo

black
that's
what
i
was
--
justice

black
did
the
record
show
when
california
exceeded
on
its
commitment
by
equipment
or
use
of
the

for
4,400,000

justice

(inaudible)
justice

did
it
show
that
(inaudible),
that
this
has
been
a
running
pipe,
as
we
all
know
for
(inaudible)?
justice

i
do
not

this,
all
of

black
appropriation
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo

black
(inaudible)
justice

i
assume
that
probably
do
you
have
a
questionable
judicial
(inaudible)
and
have
a
considerable
weight
thereafter
deciding
what
should
be
done
in
connection
with
abatement.
if
you
assume
in
other
words
that
what
is
to
be
done,
might
be
done
in
such
way
that
is
a
thing
about
a

--
have
that
effect
on

it
not

besides,
let's
say,
disaster

justice

what
i
meant
was
if

what
is
to
be
done
here
is
(inaudible)
on
the
basis
of
water.
justice

you

(inaudible)
justice

mr.
wilmer.
justice
hugo

black
may
i
ask
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
you
say
--
that
sound
seems
to
me
that
the
word
you're
using
certainly
has
meaning
that
are
not
consistent
with
the
thought
of
the
argument
you're
making.
you
said
that
several
times
that
the
united
states
has
usurped
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
merely
mean
by
that
when
they
took
it
over
and
had
the
power
to
do
it
or
they
took
it
over
wrongly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
has
a
more
limited
meaning
also?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
if
you're
saying
that
united
states
did
build
it,
they
took
it
all
over
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
reach
the
constitutional
question
which
is
not
if
--
maybe
not
yet
to
be
reached
at
all,
had
the
power
to
do
it,
what
it
is
done
is
to
give
arizona
a
certain
amount
and
california
a
certain
amount?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
nevada.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
--
to
that
extent
it
has
apportion
the
stream
and
you
accept
that
apportionment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
think
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
it,
that
the
present
perfected
rights
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
believe
that
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
section
6
or
any
of
the
others
were
intended
to
preserve
right
which
had
already
been
recognized
in
particular
persons.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
would
--
i
--
i
didn't
make
my
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
make
it
clearly
at
section
vi
which
you
refer
to
say
irrigation
and
domestic
users
and
satisfaction
present
perfected
rights
in
pursuance
of
article
viii.
now
what
do
you
understand
was
meant
by
present
perfected
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
concretely,
what
does
that
mean
that
you
believe
in
reference
to
as
such
water
has
already
been
appropriated
for
use
and
being
used
in
equipment
of
california
either
in
one
of
this
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
still
don't
quite
understand.
let's
assume
that
there
were
quite
a
number
of
projects
some
in
arizona,
some
in
california
and
some
in
nevada
already
in
use,
being
used
for
irrigation,
domestic
purposes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed.
do
you
think
that
the
act
displaced
those
so
that
they
could
be
ignored
in
the
carrying
on
the
work
by
the
manager
of
the
project?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
was
still
water
and
you
think
you're
right
were
preserved,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
how
they
could
be
protected
if
you
ignored
the
fact
that
they
have
been
using
a
certain
quantity
and
they
want
to
continue
to
use
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
you
protect
it
if
you
took
the
right?
how
--
the
right
away
those
people
to
enjoy
the
full
protection
of
the
same
amount
withheld?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
also
refer
to
certain
projects
that
already
inclusive
construction
such
as
the
metropolitan?
justice
hugo

black
i
thought
it's
a
--
justice

black
--
just
simply
wanted
to
know
that
parties
at

justice
hugo

what
year
was
that?
justice

l.
black
why
do
you
say
that
was
minor
in
that
kind
of
--
justice

black
they
were
concern
whether
or
not
being
compel
to
give
up
water
left
in
their
amount
they
agreed
to
have
in
the
upper
basin?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
your
arguments
should
be
fully
accepted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
suppose
you
should
win
every
point
that
you
have.
would
that
jeopardize
in
anyway
either
temporarily
or
permanently,
the
right
of
the
upper
basin
to
have
7,500,000
acre-feet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
effect
would
it
not
if
it's
with
use
the
amount
of
usable
water
in
debate
below
7,500,000
acre-feet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
what
practically
the
upper
basin
will
be
free
to
use
if
you
win
all
your
points.
what
will
they
be
free
to
use,
no,
they
can
use
or
that
having
a
demand,
by
reason
of
demand
you
brought
about
by
a
decree
remedying
this
controversy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
neither
--
neither
to
enlarge,
i
presume
not
to
diminish
or
to
diminish
unless
they
were
here
perhaps.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
might
have
some
bearing
on
the
fact
as
i
understood
either
statement
was
made
that
if
you
should
win,
your
argument
plainly
had
a
decree
you
seek
that
the
upper
basin
would
be
tied
to
that
so
that
might
not
be
able
to
keep
for
its
own
use
as
much
as
the
7,500,000
acre-feet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
mexico
is
a
different
situation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
controversy,
it's
never
been
in
the
controversy
in
the
compact
anywhere
else
as
to
the
upper
basin
and
the
lower
basin
derived
being
subordinated
to
carrying
out
and
to
(inaudible)
mexico.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
--
i'm
saying
now
that
if
it
should
be
diminished
by
what
you
add
and
the
decree
should
be
written
in
such
way
that
the
upper
basin
is
denied
its
7,500,000
eliminating
all
of
that
mexico
with
anything
your
argument
you'll
make
required
a
decree
to
be
written
which
wouldn't
do
that
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
upper
basin.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
your
idea
that
if
you
would
win
on
your
basis
the
decree
which
was
molded
according
to
your
argument
would
still
lead
the
upper
basin
at
all
time
so
that
it
did
not
either
temporarily
or
permanently,
unless
by
reasonable
negligence,
have
its
the
usable
water
for
use
below
7,500,000
acre-feet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
has
been
has
there
not
a
record,
(inaudible)
of
rights
that
were
existing
in
1929?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
so
far
as
1929,
there'd
be
no
question
of
just
compensation
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
what
i
mean
is,
that
--
under
that
interpretation
of
the
act
engaged
no
private
rights
have
been
with
the
water
made
(inaudible)
done
away
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
your
disagreement
exists
there
with
reference
to
what
could
be
done
after
the
act
was
passed
and
the
project
was
built
in
connection
with
the
distribution
of
the
water.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
there
would
be
no
questions
--
i'm
trying
to
get
to
that,
there'd
be
no
question
of
just
compensation
could
arise
with
reference
to
future
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
after
the
government

is
that

that

what

interpretation
was
passed.
justice

do
you
that
they
are
claiming
this
(inaudible)

as
i
understand
it
that
that
was
the

(inaudible)
that
what
effect

is
asking
with

did
it

of
the

it
didn't
get?

of
course
they
can't

(inaudible)
what
in
your
judgment
effects
could
that
have
on
the
determination
(inaudible)
determination?
justice

black
you're
standing
on
the
provision
that
the

itself
about

then
4,400,000
--
justice
hugo

black
--
2,800,000,
nevada,
300,000?
justice

and
what
did
they
propose
to
show
with

to

to
that
(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
--
that
--
in
the
question
i'm
asking
is
not
with

(inaudible)
but
what
is
it,
(voice

will
not
get
their
whole
4,600,000
or
400,000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
gets
back
to
the
interpretation
of
the
act,
does
it
not?
justice
hugo

black
but
if
--
if
the
interpretation
of
the

is
correct,
can
you
say
that
once
the

the
relevance
of
the
facts
they
offered
(inaudible)
the
claims
they're
making
would
have
on
that

justice

suppose
they
arrive
on
saying
that
the

the
act
is
wrong
to
interpret
and
that
it
should
be
(inaudible)
as
though
--
as
applied
to
the
whole
(inaudible)
justice

there
was
an
agreement
(inaudible)
how
could
it
--
if

if
that
interpretation
is
wrong,
the
decision
is
based
on
that
interpretation,
would
we
go
further
and
decide
it
in
a
(inaudible)
that
court
has
made?
justice
hugo

black
then
it
goes
back
to
what
it
means.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i
am
saying,
it
proposed
that
--
suppose
that
the
(inaudible)
on
which
the
master
made
his
report,
the
interpretation
there
is
wrong,
what
then?
justice

is
there
--
justice

(voice

what
you're
arguing,
your
arguing
is
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
master
is
that
that
--
all
water
available
(inaudible)
but
not
which
have
been
--
giving
that
meaning
so
that
they
would
get
more
that
that
four
million
six
or
four.
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
i
--
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
(inaudible)
the
master's
solution
whether
right
--
if
he's
right
(inaudible)
that
it
would
go
into
the
indefinite
future.
justice

black
a
test
maybe
as
to
minor
things
(inaudible)
on
other
matters
that
might
require
readjustments
(inaudible)
the
formula
which
--
if
they
can
(inaudible)

(inaudible)
state
of
california
against
(inaudible)
the
state
of
arizona
gets
(inaudible)
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
then
they
need
to
rule
it
as
to
appropriation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
does
that
make
to
the
interpretation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
we'll
recess.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
that
should
change
and
arizona
got
(inaudible)
indians
that
needed
it.
what
would
be
the
situation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
you
could?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
that's
the
part
of
the
term
that's
been
used
in
the
decision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
--
why
do
you
think
it
did
reserve
such
a
fixed
amount
and
make
the
finding
of
that
broad
of
a
certain
fixed
amount
that
he
used
on
that
reservation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
today
is
this.
if
your
counter
to
the
action
of
the
mohave
in
that
regard,
based
on
the
argument
that
he
had
no
right,
no
power,
should
not
have
seek
an
amount
which
must
be
held
there
for
the
indians
so
that
it
wouldn't
be
taken
away
and
diverted
for
other
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
the
challenge
on
which
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
--
you've
been
arguing
seemingly,
at
one
leg,
that
maybe
they're
--
in
a
way
the
reservation
has
been
abandoned
and
then
you
said
something
about
potential
and
they
couldn't
use
it
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
had
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
what
i
was
trying
to
find
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
basing
it
on
the
ground
that
he
has
misconstrued
what
congress
has
done
in
connection
with
the
reservation,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
it's
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
alright
now.
i
was
just
a
little
--
i
didn't
quite
understand
just
which
point
you
relied
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'd
have
a
cloud
on
your
title,
as,
i
gather,
what
you're
arguing,
was
the
basis
of
what
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
master
was
saying.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
you
could
use
temporarily
wouldn't
help
you,
i
gather,
you're
saying.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
reed,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
in
the
middle
of
your
argument.
you've
used
--
your
time
is
almost
half
over.
you've
been
describing
the
--
a
little
more,
you've
been
describing
these
reservations.
it
would
certainly
help
me,
i
don't
know
about
the
others,
if
you
would
tell
me
who
you
think
should
choose
and
select
what
water
goes
to
the
indians
and
what
are
your
arguments
as
to
the
rules
that
--
of
law
that
are
to
govern
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
would
come
to
that
point
as
soon
as
you
can,
i
would
much
--
i
could
much
better
understand
the
statistics
and
picture
you've
been
giving.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
no.
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
complaining
about
it.
but
i
just
have
not
been
able
to
understand
it
as
well
as
i
would.
if
i
could
know
from
you
what
you
say
the
master
has
done
is
wrong,
who
does
have
the
power
to
choose
what
a
matter
in
the
water
in
the
reservations
have?
has
that
choice
been
made?
if
it's
been
made,
it's
been
wrongfully
made
and,
if
so,
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
been
very,
very
helpful.
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
i
know
about
the
amount,
but
why
is
it
wrong?
what
are
the
standards
that
should
control,
that
he
has
failed
to
observe?
what
are
the
standards
that
should
be
observed
and
what
should
we
do
with
reference
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
--
did
the
master
not
say
--
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
he
said
what
was
so
materialist
of
whether
they
were
using
it
personally?
it
was
the
amount
of
water
that
was
due
to
go
to
that
reservation
and
do
you
challenge
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
this
farming
economy
is
used
there
but
not
used
by
indians.
what
is
your
position
with
reference
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
understand
what
you
were
reading
from
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
reservation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
follow
you,
why
this
would
be
ir
--
why
couldn't
reconcile
those
two.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
evidence
that
we're
not
getting
it
in
here
was
a
provision
made
by
congress
to
see
that
they
did
get
water
in
a
way
which
should
be
available
to
them.
i
don't
see
why
that
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
negate
the
original
purpose
to
supply
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
water
to
run
the
reservation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it
not
have
been
perfectly
consistent
that
they
had
agreed
to
let
them
have
the
reservation
where
they
could
have
water
and
decide
to
give
it
to
them
in
the
most
convenient
and
least
expensive
way
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
that
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
they
were
getting
the
water
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
get
it
at
this
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
right
is
there
theoretically
until
you
can
get
the
water.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
just
quite
see
why
these
two
are
irreconcilable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
may
be
right,
but
i
just
didn't
see
why
the
two
are
irreconcilable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
pardon
me,
mr.
sutter,
i
don't
want
to
delay
you
but
you
made
one
suggestion
there
that
ariz
--
that
the
upper
basin
would
not
be
disturbed
so
long
as
it
sends
down
seven-and-a
half
million
feet.
does
that
mean
that
we
have
to
decide
here
or
that
we
could
decide
so
it
provide
in
the
upper
basin?
they're
required
to
send
7,500,000
feet,
although
they
do
not
yet
use
that
much
in
the
upper
basin.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
--
did
i
misunderstand
mr.
wilmer?
i
thought
you
said
that
arizona
was
not
taking
any
effects
on
the
upstream
tributaries,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

black
be
above
lee
ferry?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
he
said
it
then
in
the
project?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
wondering
whether
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
they
get
the
possibility
rather
than
reality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
a
permit
to
do
this
from
the
federal
government
if
they
want
to
take
the
water
out
of
the
--
above
the
lake?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
by
basic
theory,
the
--
it
is
the
interpretation
of
the
project
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
44?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
you
reading
from?
i'm
very
sorry
that
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
145?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
see
it.
it
does
go
that
far
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
there?
i
assume
at
that
time,
they
were
not
thinking
of
present
perfected
rights
according
to
the
definition,
the
masticated
year,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
with
reference
to
claim
or
with
reference
to
existing
projects.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
that
speaking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
time
of
the
discussion
you've
just
read
between
senator
johnson
and
hayden
that
the
amendment
then
pending
contained
this
provision,
two
and
three
with
reference
to
reservations
of
the
gila
river
above
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
did
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
in
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
way
contracts
for
the
sale
of
power
are
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
an
argument
as
i
recall
it,
there
is
figures
argument
in
the
sentence
that
the
state
should
have
a
right
to
determine
to
whom
this
--
the
power
would
be
sold
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
power
to
sell
water
--
your
power
to
sell
water
and
the
power
to
sell
power
are
given
in
the
same
sections.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
question
was
based
on
this
general
idea.
during
this
debate,
there
was
quite
a
fight
or
controversy
over
the
sell
of
power.
the
argument
being
made
that
the
government,
although
it
had
the
constitutional
right
to
build
the
dam,
build
the
dam.
he
did
not
have
a
right
to
dispose
a
power
and
the
same
argument
related
to
some
extent
to
the
right
to
sell
water,
so
those
--
that
--
the
two
--
two
do
bear
or
rather
close
relationship
in
some
assets
although
there
is
a
distinction
with
reference
to
water
run
and
the
power
to
sell
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
up
to
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
solicitor
general.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
we
are
not
required
to
do
so
by
the
attack
which
is
made
on
the
nevada
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
you
mean
to
bring
in
all
the
projects
that
might
possibly
have
affected
rights
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
had
a
lawsuit
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
you
do
that,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question
that
you
can
answer
if
you
wish.
the
statute
provided
for
the
payment
for
what
was
bought
from
this
place
necessary,
as
i
recall
it,
to
liquidate
in
the
certain
time
the
indebtedness
and
with
much
interest
in
whether
or
not
the
government
was
going
to
bear
unnecessary
expenses.
in
carrying
out
his
power,
what
has
been
the
position
of
the
secretary
with
reference
to
compensation
for
water
and
for
power,
and
is
there
any
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
this
use
is
not
an
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
(inaudible)
population
to
use.
can
you
seek
it
here?
i'm
not
saying
you
can.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
if
--
if
in
fact
the
use
for
the
reservation
as
to
which
(inaudible)
should
be
done
and,
sadly,
that
needs
to
be
--
or
has
shrunk,
i
think
it
comes
to
light
in
the
doctrine
of
(inaudible).
don't
let

correct.

if
that
is

somewhat
the
same
philosophy
that
mr.

suggested
in
washington?
in
other
words,

they
get

was

concrete,
what
do

one

california
had

in

may

assume
that

what

found
(inaudible)
with

leads
to
the

(inaudible)
california
had
a
right
despite
its

to
depend
water

get

when
do

say
that,
1929

refuse
arizona
the

well,
arizona,
didn't
have
a
limitation
right.
justice

black
well,
then
i
am
correct
that
in
your
argument,
california's
argument
leaves
inevitable
to
the
conclusion
that
by
doing
something
after
1929,
california,
whether
right
or
wrong,
i'm
not
guessing,
california
could
get
water
at
the
expense
of
arizona
loosing
the
2,200,000

2,800,000

justice

black
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
say
that
my
trouble
with
this
argument
from
the
beginning
in
the
subject
to
what
law
that
governs
has
been
this.
if
the
secretary
--
if
the
man
to
his
rights,
in
holding
the
allocation
has
been
made
then
there
are
now
no
disputes
between
any
persons
claims
under
the
state
law,
and
the
fact
that
the
secretary
is
hiding
something
and
between
him
and
the
secretary.
i
do
not
see
how
that
is
into
the
case
or
why
we
should
lock
out
into
such
an
important
piece
of
law
in
a
matter
of
this
compact
until
we
have
accurate
controversy.
now,
after
the
government
has
built
its
dam,
maybe,
sometime
there
will
be
a
dispute
that
those
states
still
have
the
right
to
decide
who
will
get
it
but
i
haven't
seen
it
in
this
case.
