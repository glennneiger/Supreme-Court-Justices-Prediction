why
would
california?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
i
understand
that's
treating,
the
2,000,000
feet
in
gila
as
being
in
the
mainstream
at
lee
ferry?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
get
back
to
what
i
--
the
question
that
was
asked
for
whether
or
not
this
(inaudible)
was
relevant.
if
the
figure
7,500,000
acre-feet,
it
seems
--
it
seems
at
the
point
where
the
(inaudible)
and
likewise,
the
other
one
is
(inaudible)
so
the
water
in
the
gila
is
not
racking
into
it
in
those
complications,
is
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
kind
of
term
would
you
think
of
as
if
you
expressly
felt
immediately
than
to
say
rights
that
are
now
perfected?
isn't
that
what
“present”
you're
saying?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
isn't
in
there,
is
it?
it
would
be
with
a
body
of
law
which
needs
protecting
to
relate
back,
then
it
isn't
going
to
like
the
use
of
words.
present
perfected
right
doesn't
mean
what
it
means
in
the
accepted
usage
of
those
communities,
those
states.
namely,
it
is
a
present
perfected
right
in
the
sense
that,
until
an
event
takes
place,
the
rights
in
becoming
seen
but,
when
it
does
take
place,
it's
the
right
that
is
recognized
in
the
body
of
law
in
the
other
states.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
is
a
question
of
etymology
of
reading
this
word.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
a
question
of
how
it's
translated.
i'm
not
asking
you
about
it.
all
i'm
saying
is
i'm
troubled
with
the
verb
being
coupled
to
make
it
all
depend
on
a
word
like
“present”,
and
i
can
perfectly
feel
and
perfectly
mean
that
it
has
reached
that
finality
which,
if
it
can
reach,
had
asserted
legal
counsel.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
more
--
this
merely
convinces
me,
personally,
but
i
never
followed
it
in
construction
of
my
judgment,
except
water
right
is
to
truly
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
one
last
point.
we
might
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we
might
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
maybe
we
don't
have
to
decide
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
might
be
--
that
might
be
a
very
good
reason
to
avoid
this
action
no
more
than
it's
actually
compelling
us
to
work
with
the
issue
we
would
take.
now,
this
may
be
one
of
that
--
