mr.
earl
e.
hartley
mr.
justice
black.
following
14
hours
of
continuous
argument,
there
of
course
arises
a
question
of
whether
anything
new
to
be
said
on
the
subjects
that
have
been
discussed
eloquently
and
lengthily.
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
of
nevada,
while
the
amounts
of
water
involved
are
small,
is
so-situated
that
it
probably
will
be
the
most
direct
--
directly
and
precisely
affected
by
the
outcome
of
this
litigation
than
any
state
involved.
for
that
reason,
after
the
institution
of
the
action,
the
state
through
its
then
attorney
general,
mr.
william
t.
mathews,
and
who
has
been
in
the
case
throughout,
is
accompanying
me
here
today,
intervened
on
the
theory
that
nevada,
as
one
of
the
three
sovereign
lower
basin
states,
had
an
interest
which
would
be
inevitably
affected
by
the
outcome
of
the
action.
nevada's
situation
is
along
the
western
and
northern
side
of
the
lake
mead
reservoir
and
the
stream
immediately
below
as
shown
by
the
map
which
has
been
placed
on
the
easel
and
also
it
is
indicated
by
the
map
b
which
california
supply.
a
brief
description
of
some
of
the
geographical
features
i
think
is
in
order
because
they
affect
particularly
the
issues
between
the
united
states
and
nevada
on
the
two
exceptions
the
united
states
has
taken
to
the
decree.
nevada
finds
itself
in
this
perhaps
unique
position.
it
was
an
intervener
in
the
action
and,
now,
when
the
case
has
reached
this
posture,
it
finds
itself
more
completely
supporting
the
master's
theory
than
any
other
party
to
the
case.
the
--
on
geographical
feature
of
nevada
divided
generally
into
two
faces.
generally
to
the
north
of
lake
mead,
there
are
streams
entering
the
virgin
river
which
originates
in
utah,
comes
across
the
corner
of
arizona,
and
comes
down
into
the
reservoir.
prior
to
the
construction
of
the
reservoir,
the
muddy
river
which
came
in
from
the
northwest,
with
the
long
tributary
called
the
meadow
valley
wash,
flowed
into
the
virgin
before
it
run
into
the
colorado,
but
that
amount
has
been
obscured
by
the
reservoir
itself.
as
i
understand,
answering
a
question
of
one
of
the
justices
yesterday,
the
dam
itself
merely
in
the
--
what
would
be
the
upper
end
of
black
canyon
or
somewhere
in
the
part
of
that,
there
was
black
canyon
where
nevada
is.
there
was
a
--
kind
of
an
open
flight
stair
in
that
big
canyon
with
an
old
pioneer
fork
and
then
the
boulder
canyon
is
immediately
above.
so,
into
a
black
canyon
and
boulder
canyon
are
practically
contiguous
and
they
are
in
the
reservoir
which
extends
to
the
north,
flows
by
as
water
that
is
impounded
and
backed
up
into
the
valley
of
the
virgin
river,
sometimes
known
as
the
virgin
r,
as
in
reservoir.
on
the
virgin
river
and
the
muddy
river,
there
was
what
was
for
that
area
a
very
early
settlement,
starting
along
in
the
1870's
by
pioneers
most
of
whom
came
down
from
utah
and
were
of
the
lds
faith.
and
for
a
long
time,
and
--
that
was
the
only
settlement
in
that
area
because
there
was
only
place
where
it
was
possible
to
divert
water
for
irrigation
and
there
on
those
tributaries,
at
long
standing
existence
is
an
irrigated
area
with
a
consumptive
use
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
50,000
acre-feet
of
water.
i
will
come
back
to
this
again
later,
but
that
is
one
of
the
questions
where
we
argue
with
the
united
states
as
to
whether
our
300,000
acre-feet,
which
everyone
says
nevada
was
always
going
to
be
given,
should
be
diminished
by
not
50,000
acre-feet
of
pre-existing
consumptive
use.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
initiated,
mr.
justice
along
in
1870,
1880,
and
1890,
along
in
there.
there
was
no
substantial
other
development
in
that
area,
except
a
small
railroad
division
point
around
las
vegas
which
lies
in
the
west
of
the
dam
and
is
situated
in
what
is
known
as
the
las
vegas
valley.
in
that
las
vegas
valley,
there
was
a
--
there
is
some
underground
water.
the
evidence
shows
that
that's
a
closed
basin,
what
water
is
there
drains
in
from
the
mountains
to
the
west
which
are
small
in
area
the
rain
fall
is
very
scant
and,
at
the
time
of
the
authorization
of
the
boulder
canyon
project,
there
were
some-3,000
or
4,000
people
only
living
in
that
area.
there
is
no
place
in
the
lower
colorado
basement
leased
that
is
more
dependent
on
the
colorado
river
water
than
that
southern
section
of
nevada.
there
just
is
simply
and
precisely
no
other
source
of
water,
good,
bad
or
of
any
quality,
and
the
--
it
has
all
the
characteristics,
i've
been
inclined
to
say,
as
the
oasis
up
in
the
sahara
desert.
the
ultimate
development
of
that
area
is
going
to
be
purely
and
simply
controlled
by
the
amount
of
water
that
is
allotted
to
nevada
out
to
the
colorado
river.
at
that
point,
in
fact
the
reason
the
dam
is
there
is
that
there
is
this
deep
canyon
but
even
with
the
dam
of
the
height
that
it
is
and
the
water
impounded
in
it.
it
is
still
necessary
to
raise
the
water
from
the
dam
over
into
the
las
vegas
valley
by
pumping.
the
first
pump
at
that
time
was
installed
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation
as
a
part
of
the
construction
of
the
dam
to
supply
boulder
city,
which
has
now
become
a
very
beautiful
garden
spot
by
reason
of
the
application
of
water.
the
use
of
water
in
--
the
expanding
use,
i
should
say,
that
is
involved
in
this
case
is
that
in
the
las
vegas
valley
area
and
the
several
surrounding
valleys
which
extend
to
the
south
and
to
the
north
and
to
the
east.
being
confronted
with
a
situation
where
california
was
saying
nevada
can
have
water
for
existing
use
and
no
more,
as
has
been
repeated
here.
nevada
employed
a
group
of
the
most
eminent
experts
that
she
could
obtain,
had
detailed
analysis
of
the
lands
made,
had
economic
studies
of
possible
future
growth
developed,
had
studies
made
of
the
mineral
possibilities,
evaluation
of
the
excellent
transportation
facilities
that
exist
in
that
area.
the
climate
which
is
the
type
that
is
currently
drawing
into
the
southwest
this
great
migration
of
people,
and
endeavored
to
make
the
best
possible
study
that
could
be
made
as
to
what
would
reasonably
be
the
population
and
the
requirement
of
water
in
the
year
2000,
not
assuming
any
increase
in
irrigation
but
assuming
uses
for
domestic
use,
industrial
uses,
and
municipal
use.
the
belief
of
those
making
the
study
in
the
state
of
nevada
was
that,
as
a
sovereign
state,
it
had
a
inherent
right,
as
one
of
the
lower
basin
states,
to
apportion
of
the
water
of
the
river.
it
was
not
the
thought
to
assert
that
right
by
any
extravagant
claims
that
we
should
take
this
precious
water
and
use
it
for
irrigation
purposes,
but
if
the
area
was
to
grow,
if
there
were
to
be
people
there,
by
then
it
was
going
to
be
necessary
to
bring
in
this
colorado
river
water
up.
probably,
the
second
biggest
step
in
bringing
the
water
was
done
in
conjunction
to
the
united
states
of
america
building
the
great
henderson
magnesium
plants
during
the
war.
the
united
states
government
assisted
to
the
extent
of
several
hundred
million
dollars
there.
the
closeness
of
the
great
power
supply,
the
availability
of
the
water
supply,
and
so
forth
created
this
great
complex
which
supply
of
practically
all
the
magnesium
which
was
used
during
world
war
ii.
those
plants
have
now
been
transferred
over
to
private
enterprise
where
there
is
a
complex
of
chemical
and
other
similar
industries
there.
then
the
water
district
of
--
it
supplies
domestic
water
to
the
city
of
las
vegas
and
its
environs
found
that
it
was
running
very
short
of
water
because
its
underground
basin,
the
only
source
of
water,
was
being
overdrawn
to
extend
20,000-25,000
acre-feet
every
year.
it
isn't
necessary
to
stop
the
drilling
of
additional
wells.
and
so,
through
the
colorado
river
commission
which
i
will
mention
in
detail
later,
which
is
the
body
of
the
state
of
nevada
created
approximately
simultaneously
with
the
creation
of
this
project
to
take
and
handle
nevada's
share
of
this
precious
water
and
to
see
that
it
was
distributed
in
the
correct
and
the
most
beneficial
way.
this
colorado
river
commission
participated
in
increasing
the
size
of
this
pumping
plant
from
the
river
and
bringing
the
water
over
for
de
--
beneficial
use
in
that
area,
and
there
are
continuing
plans
for
a
continually
expanding
use.
the
point
that
i
am
particularly
emphasizing
is
that
this
need
of
water
in
nevada
is
principally
for
the
--
just
the
plain
support
of
human
life,
and
the
number
of
people
that
are
going
to
ever
be
able
to
live
in
that
area
is
going
to
be
fixed
by
the
amount
of
water
available.
if
we
assume
--
these
engineer's
designs
have
many
figures,
but
if
we
assume
an
average
gallon
per
day
consumption
of
around
300
gallons
per
day,
which
seems
to
be
fairly
acceptable
for
all
of
them,
an
acre-foot
of
water
will
support
about
three
people
for
a
year.
and
if
we're
--
if
california
is
saying
that
you
don't
get
your
300,000
acre-feet,
you
only
get
120,000
acre-feet,
the
hundred
--
the
missing
180,000
feet
would
be
your
water
supply
for
roughly
around
half-a-million
people.
and,
whenever
the
nevada's
participation
in
the
colorado
river
water
has
reached
the
maximum
of
it,
that
will
inevitably
be
the
maximum
or
top
of
the
development
where
there
is
no
seawater
to
be
converted,
there
is
no
brackish
water
to
be
converted
and,
so
far
as
anything
now
known
in
even
the
most
penetrating
crystal
ball,
there
is
no
other
source
of
water.
passing
to
the
subject
that
we
--
that
has
been
discussed
at
so
much
length
here,
it
has
occurred
to
us
that
a
good
deal
of
the
confusion
is
due
to
the
fact
that,
in
the
one
act
which
we
call
the
project
act,
there
has
been
taken
two
steps
which
in
most
common
historical
custom,
at
least
in
the
west,
has
been
accomplished
separately.
and,
those
two
steps
is
the
ratification
of
the
compact
between
sovereign
states
and
the
united
states,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
other
is
the
authorization
of
this
great
project
which
combines
the
dam,
the
reservoir,
the
power
plant,
the
diversion
dam
down
in
imperial,
and
the
great
all-american
canal.
the
--
ordinarily,
as
i
say,
those
were
probably
been
done
separately.
in
other
words,
the
states
after
their
meeting
which
has
been
discussed
at
such
great
length
came
over
to
congress
with
the
compact.
i
think
it
is
--
as
it
has
been
said,
it
is
only
necessary
to
hear
and
determine
those
parts
of
the
compact
which
perhaps
as
definitions
are
by
reference
used
in
the
project
act
and
the
language
which
has
caused
much
of
the
confusion.
but
so
far
as
the
compact
itself,
it
isn't
so
theoretically
complicated.
as
we
read
it,
they
agreed
that
there
would
be
set
aside
for
beneficial
use
up
to
7.5
million
acre-feet
annually
in
the
upper
basin
and
8.5
million
acre-feet
in
the
lower
basin.
that
the
upper
basin
then
always
permit
75
million
acre-feet
in
this
rolling
ten
year
period
to
encompass
lee
ferry,
plus
any
amounts
it
might
be
required
to
contribute
to
the
mexican
burden.
they
agreed
that
the
upper
basin
would
not
withhold
nor
would
the
lower
basin
ever
require
the
delivery
of
any
water
unless
it
was
actually
needed
for
beneficial
consumptive
use.
in
that
compact,
they
originated
this
what
i
think,
unique
term
“present
perfected
rights”
as
being
unimpaired
to
the
compact.
and
they
used
it
--
and
they
used
it
alone
in
that
one
sense.
elsewhere
in
the
compact,
they
talk
about
appropriations.
again
in
this
action
it
seems
to
me,
since
the
final
decision
is
going
to
be
a
construction
of
the
project
act,
it
becomes
important
to
think
of
that
term
“present
perfected
rights”
only
because
by
reference
it
is
carried
over
into
the
part
of
the
act
which
authorized
this
great
project
as
separate
from
the
part
of
the
compact.
and
then
there
is
one
other
provision
in
the
compact
that
has
--
i
believe
some
impact
on
a
construction
of
the
project
act,
and
that
is
the
provision
which,
so
far
as
the
compact
is
concerned,
says
whenever
there
are
five
million
or
more
acre-feet
of
storage
in
the
lower
basin
that
this
present
perfected
rights
are
to
be
supplied
from
it.
by
“it”,
i
mean
the
storage
water.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
i
am
not
aware
of
it
justice
frankfurter.
the
--
and
then
as
i
mentioned
that
languages
by
reference
carried
over
into
the
project.
now,
the
congress
made
only
one
change
in
that
compact.
if
at
that
time
they
hadn't
been
bothering
about
building
--
or
authorizing
the
construction,
rather
of
the
project
itself,
the
only
they
said,
"if
the
seven
states
can
agree
on
this
contract
within
six
months,
we
will
approve
it
in
six
states
in
agreement,
provided
that
california
passes
the
limitation
which
has
been
referred
to
so
repetitiously
in
this
action.”
that's
the
only
change
in
the
compact
that
was
made
by
the
congress.
and
the
congress
and
the
compact,
if
we
think
of
it,
segregated
out
and
think
of
it
as
a
separate
document,
therefore,
stands
as
an
agreement
between
the
states
covering
the
points
that
i
have
mentioned
in
with
this
california
limitation.
obviously,
the
compact
did
not
endeavor
to
allocate
the
water
between
the
states
of
the
upper
basin
or
the
lower
basin.
as
has
been
mentioned,
the
upper
basin
states
were
able
to
agree
and
have
themselves
allocated
the
water.
the
lower
basin
states,
i
--
they
are
no
more
in
agreement
in
1962
then
they
were
in
1922.
that
situation
remained
static.
but
certainly
when
congress
affirmed
the
compact,
it
was
not
in
the
compact
sense,
in
any
sense
attempting
to
allocate
the
waters
between
the
lower
basin
states.
i
don't
--
it's
been
pointed
out
and
it's
obvious
from
this
lengthy
legislative
history,
it
was
repeatedly
stated
by
the
senators
affected
that
they
were
not
going
to
write
a
compact
for
the
lower
basin.
that
they
were
not
going
to
make
it
mandatory
on
any
of
the
states
in
the
lower
basin
to
do
this
or
to
do
that.
and
that
they
were
no
more
attempting
to
do
that
for
the
lower
basin
than
they
were
for
the
upper
basin.
but
it
was
absolutely
necessary,
if
we
look
at
the
other
part
of
the
situation
and
think
of
the
authorization
of
this
project,
that
the
congress
must
of
necessity
make
some
provisions
where
the
disposition
of
the
water
that
was
going
to
be
stored
in
and
delivered
from
that
project.
and
that's
as
inevitable
as
day
following
night
and
i
believe
it
is
the
logical
interpretation
of
this
act
that
all
of
this
discussion
of
this
7.5
million
acre-feet
that's
going
to
be
divided.
always
300,000
to
nevada,
except
today
when
we
find
it
cut
down,
and
2
million
acre
to
arizona
and
this
fluctuating
amount
to
california,
that
that
inevitably
must
be
considered
to
be
a
determination
of
a
distribution
of
water
that
was
going
to
be
controlled
by
that
project
and
derived
from
it
and
resulting,
as
i
will
mention
it
in
a
moment,
from
the
water
right
of
that
project.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
one
gap
in
our
thinking
and
are
arguing
here
is
what
was
the
water
right
of
that
project?
but,
before
i
go
to
that,
the
congress
must
consider,
how
the
waters
that
were
going
to
originate
when
this
great
reservoir
was
created?
how
it
was
going
to
be
divided
just
as
much
as
it
would
as
the
power,
as
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
black.
they
were
the
inherent
results,
the
only
reason,
for
expending
this
great
amount
of
money.
now
then,
this
suit
in
some
way
turns
upon
the
argument
of
california
which
is
based
upon
the
assumption
that
the
water
priorities
that
existed
on
that
river
survived
the
project.
that
is
a
corner
stone
of
the
california
briefs,
both
before
the
mater
and
before
this
court
in
the
argument
here.
and
the
fact
is,
i
believe
that
that
whole
body
of
argument
is
just
as
valid
as
the
basic
exemption
and
no
more.
and
i
think
it
is
--
the
basic
exemption
is
contrary
to
what
actually
happened
when
the
united
states
of
america,
through
its
congress
decided
to
enter
upon
this
navigable
stream
and
build
this
combined
power
and
water
project
and
in
effect
preempted
if
i
might
say,
the
river.
there
has
been
some
facetious
remarks
that
there
was
a
red
river
there
which
on
one
of
the
maps,
i
think
this
map
chart
a
--
chart
b
as
starts
at
the
upper
reaches
of
lake
mead
and
continues
down
to
the
mexican
boundary.
well,
the
color
is
not
particularly
significant.
there
are
certainly
can
be
no
doubt
that
at
this
time,
that
that
separate
river
is
a
very
real
and
a
distinct
thing
because
that
entire
area
of
the
river
has
been
taken
under
control
by
the
united
states
by
the
series
of
dams
starting
with
the
hoover
dam,
the
lake
mead,
or
the
davis
dam,
the
parker
dam,
the
headgate
rock
dam,
the
imperial
dam,
and
all
of
the
others.
there
is
a
body
of
water
extending
from
lake
mead
to
the
mexican
border
which
is
being
handled
and
controlled
by
the
united
states
as
a
separate
and
distinct
entity.
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
judge
rifkind
was
entirely
logical.
in
his
result,
we
may
quarrel
with
his
language
but
he
found
before
him
as
he
sat
and
listened
to
these
millions
of
words,
that
there
was
that
section
of
river,
a
reservoir,
and
a
series
of
dams,
and
the
diversion
from
it,
that
the
united
states
was
handling,
that
it
was
controlling
and,
out
of
which,
the
water
had
to
be
delivered
and
concerned
which
--
the
secretary
had
made
contracts
for
the
delivery
of
water.
now
then,
of
course
the
basic
water
supply
for
this
whole
complex
along
the
river,
one
--
i
think
one
of
the
most
magnificent
in
the
world.
what
was
the
water
right
for
the
dam
itself?
as
it
had
been
pointed
out
by
questions
from
the
court,
it
is
the
general
custom
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
the
same
entity
that
built
this
dam,
secretary
of
the
interior.
he
goes
out
to
build
the
dam
on
the
yakima
river
or
the
boise
river,
the
snake
river,
and
any
other
rivers
and
all
the
rest,
he
acquires
a
water
right.
he
acquires
the
right
to
take
over
the
flow
of
that
stream
and
now
there
are
other
people
there
with
other
water
rights
and
many
times
older
ones.
they
got
there
first
because
in
some
ways
on
the
western
streams
the
united
states
is
what
may
be
called
a
johnny-come-lately,
and
that's
the
water
right
for
the
project.
it's
the
one
that,
under
section
8
of
the
reclamation
law,
it
has
been
the
custom
of
the
department
of
interior
to
acquire
under
state
law
in
every
instance,
so
far
as
i
know,
except
that
of
the
boulder
dam.
if
this
normal
procedure
had
been
followed
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
he
would
have
gone
to
the
state
of
nevada
where
one
end
of
the
dam
is
located
and
the
state
of
arizona
where
the
other
end
of
the
dam
is
located
and
say,
“i
am
going
to
build
this
project
and
i
want
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
get
a
water
right
for
it.”
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
that's
for
the
water
out
of
the
dam,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
but
not
the
water
flowing
pass,
not
the
water
in
the
river.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
i
am
distinguishing
and
i
think,
if
i
may
make
it
clear
that
it
is
--
the
failure
to
make
that
distinction
is
the
basic
reason
for
much
of
the
trouble
in
this
action
because
the
united
states
must,
of
necessity,
have
some
kind
of
a
right
for
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
which
is
--
which
it
takes
and
which
it
stores,
and
which
it
said,
"nevada,
you
can
have
so
much
under
your
contract.
you
california
people
can
have
so
much
under
yours."
and
--
and
i
think
the
legal
inquiry
here
is,
what
is
the
right
of
the
united
states?
and
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
this,
being
a
navigable
stream
and
following
the
deci
--
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
starting
with
the
appellants
in
the
case
in
chandler-dunbar,
the
twin
city
power,
and
all
the
rest.
that
the
united
states
took
over
the
control
and
the
management
of
the
whole
of
the
colorado
river
with
the
right
to
dispose
of
it
by
contract
as
provided
in
the
project
act,
section
5,
except
only
those
rights
which
might
in
that
area
be
nominated
for
present
perfected
rights.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
the
only
rights,
at
that
time,
existing
in
nevada
were
those
above
lake
mead
on
the
virgin
and
muddy
rivers.
there
were
no
diversions
from
the
main
river.
there
were
some
diversions
in
arizona
and
the
california
diversion.
and
i
cannot
say
how
any
priorities
can
be
said
to
be
an
existent
today,
any
conflicting
claims
to
the
waters
of
this
river
against
the
claim
of
the
united
states
to
take
the
water
and
start,
except
those
which
were
specifically
preserved
by
the
act
itself
and
called
denominated
present
perfected
rights.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
no,
that's
just
the
minimum
amount
of
nevada,
your
honor,
up
in
--
above
the
reservoir.
what
i
am
speaking
of
more
is
the
group
of
rights
down
in
california
in
the
order
of
three
million
acre-feet.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
well,
i
don't
know
whether
they
could
even
be
characterized
as
that.
and
50,000
acre-feet
is
a
consumptive
use
figure
of
uses
above
lake
mead
and
that
comes
into
effect
here
more
in
our
controversy
with
the
government
over
deductions
from
the
nevada
contract
than
they
do
from
a
determination
of
what
are
the
rights
in
the
mainstream
itself.
but
as
--
i
think
this
is
true
that,
from
the
action
of
the
congress
in
the
project
act,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
making
his
contracts
for
the
california
users
was
charged
with
the
necessity.
he
must
recognize
those
present
perfected
rights
and
he
couldn't
not
take
them
into
account
as
well
as
he
was
by
the
limitation
which
would
put
the
ceiling
on
the
total
amount
of
water
that
california
could
take
of
out
of
this
project.
now,
such
a
determination,
in
my
opinion,
would
be
consistent
with
the
entire
body
of
water
law
in
the
west.
i
think
we
should
look
at,
since
the
major
thrust
of
this
whole
contention
here
is
what
were
the
rights
of
the
california
parties,
as
to
what
their
rights
were
at
that
time
that
would
in
--
unquestionably
come
in
as
present
perfected
rights.
there
were
the
old
rights
of
the
yuma
district
and
of
the
palo
verde
district
which
have
been
described
here.
under
any
interpretation
of
the
master's
decree,
those
rights
would
be
ineffective.
so,
i
see
no
reason
to
spend
any
particular
time
talking
about
them.
they
were
old
in
time.
they're
given
the
oldest
priorities
in
this
intrastate
seven-party
california
agreement.
they
have,
i
am
sure,
however,
changed
their
character
before
boulder
dam
was
constructed.
they
were
simply
running
the
river
rights.
if
the
river
was
there
running
enough
water
to
supply
them,
they
got
the
water.
if
it
wasn't
there,
obviously,
they
didn't.
the
next
in
point
of
quantity
and
perhaps
the
breaking
point
are
the
rights
of
the
imperial
irrigation
district.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
has
been
a
radical
change
in
those
rights
and
that
they
--
and
i
think
very
wisely,
transformed
their
right
from
whatever
it
was,
as
has
been
mentioned
before
that,
there
was
an
appropriation
from
the
river
by
a
mexican
company
which
took
the
water
down
into
mexico
and
then
the
amount
of
water
that
the
mexicans
didn't
take
flowed
back
northerly
into
the
united
states
and
was
used
in
united
--
in
the
imperial
valley.
they've
heard
the
story
of
tremendous
floods.
there
were
shortages
in
the
dry
months
of
the
summer
time.
as
a
result
of
the
construction
of
this
complex
of
the
storage
reservoir
in
the
boulder
canyon,
the
imperial
diversion
dam
down
below,
the
great
all-american
canal
there
was
created
a
new
and
different
diversion
from
the
river,
and
they
were
assured
a
constant
supply
of
storage
water.
and,
i
would
think
that
any
decree
that
would
be
ultimately
entered
aligned
with
the
master's
suggestion
should
reserve
to
that
entity
the
amount
by
which
they
had
a
present
perfected
right
at
the
time
that
the
act
became
effective.
but
in
my
opinion,
the
metropolitan
district
does
not
fall
in
that
category
but,
as
they
thought
of
it,
there
were
some
engineering
work
been
done,
it
has
been
described
by
somebody
as
a
gleam
of
somebody's
eye
but
it
certainly
wasn't
a
perfected
water
right
by
any
definition
that
i
know
of
in
the
law
of
the
western
states.
its
--
it
obtains
its
water
by
a
contract
from
the
secretary.
it
is
water
that
is
stored
in
this
project
that
was
authorized
by
the
congress.
i
fail
to
see
any
inherent
numbers
between
its
contract
rights
and
those
of
the
state
of
nevada.
by
coincidence
they
are
the
only
two
that
pay
any
money
for.
the
--
but
it
was
simply
a
contract
right.
now,
i
think
all
of
this
is
of
materiality
in
assessing
the
impact
of
the
master's
decision.
he
--
to
cover
it
very
briefly,
upheld
the
validity
of
the
california
contracts
within
the
boundaries
of
the
limitation,
the
validity
of
the
arizona
contract
for
2.8
million
acre-feet
and
that
of
nevada,
0.3.
he
provided
that,
in
times
of
shortage,
present
perfected
rights
should
be
perfected
or
be
protected.
even
if
it
required
taking
the
allotment
from
the
other
states
and
in
doing
that
i
believe
that
he
fulfilled
every
priority
that
could
be
established
as
a
priority
as
against
the
storage
water
in
the
dam
in
any
suit
and
in
any
form
under
any
rule
that
might
be
laid
down.
as
it
had
been
mentioned,
he
provided,
in
times
of
shortage,
first,
there
should
be
this
proration.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
was
a
very
logical
and
consistent
thing
to
provide
because,
as
it's
been
mentioned
at
length,
what
the
flow
of
the
stream
is
going
to
be
is
probably
unknown
to
man.
the
--
if
--
when
there
is
a
shortage
in
the
amount
of
water
that
emanates
from
that
project
then,
to
provide
for
this
proration
accompanied
by
the
protection
of
the
present
perfected
rights,
i
think
everyone
is
protected
that
needed
to
be
protected.
it
hasn't
created
any
threats
or
a
fear
against
the
upper
basin.
there
is
no
evidence
that
anybody
in
california
or
the
small
present
perfected
rights
on
the
arizona
side
will
be
adversely
affected.
i
should
mention
in
passing
that
it's
very
clear
that
these
california
rights
have
never
been
considered
by
anyone
to
have
been
preserved
in
their
original
character,
what
i'd
call
normal
flow
of
rights
or
running
the
river
rights
which
is
all
they
could
have
been
prior
to
the
construction
of
the
project.
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
that
characteristic
has
been
preserved
since
the
construction
of
the
project.
next,
the
situation
that
confronted
the
court
in
these
interstate
streams
such
as
nebraska
versus
wyoming,
colorado
versus
kansas,
and
so
forth,
there,
there
were
--
old
rights
were
still
being
protected.
there
were
also
rights
for
federally
constructed
reservoirs.
and,
this
question
of
the
--
whether
or
not
a
right
retains
its
original
characteristic
after
the
government
comes
in
with
a
project
was
considered
by
the
court
in
the
north
platte
river.
and
it's
cited
in
our
replied
brief
at
page
24
united
states
versus
tilley,
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
and
that
case
is
of
interest
in
pointing
out
what
steps
would've
been
necessary
to
followed
if
there
had
been
in
this
last
three
decades,
any
thought
or
belief
that
there
were
some
california
prior
rights
being
preserved
as
against
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
his
right
to
stop
the
water
in
lake
mead
and
hold
it
there
unless
and
until
it
was
discharged
inconjuct
--
in
pursuance
to
the
existing
contracts.
and
that
i
believe,
is
the
real
test
and
that
is
i
think
where
many
of
us
have
wondered
astray
perhaps
in
this
sometimes
academic
discussion
of
priorities.
now,
in
--
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
not
any
more,
as
against
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
in
my
opinion
and
if
that
--
is
this
the
inevitable
result
of
the
authorization
and
construction
of
that
project.
as
i
say,
by
a
strange
turn
of
the
wheel,
it
might
be
determined
little
nevada
is
here,
perhaps
more,
well
precipitously
supporting
the
master's
theory
than
any
of
the
other
parties
of
the
case
that
i
think
it
is
a
logical
sound
and
workable
solution.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
perhaps,
if
that's
possible
in
any
counsel.
now,
nevas
--
nevada's
basic
position,
however,
has
been
that
it
is
entitled
to
this
300,000
acre-feet
allocation,
under
any
theory
upon
which
the
case
might
be
decided.
we
presented
a
volume
of
evidence
and
we
think
it
is
persuasive
that
as
that
portion
of
nevada
which
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
is
absolutely
dependent
upon
the
colorado
river
for
survival,
if
we
even
take
the
year
2000
as
a
cutoff,
it
would
be
an
excess
of
the
amount
that
is
awarded
in
our
contract.
if
there
was
no
contractual
allocation
scheme
at
all,
let's
make
that
assumption
either
permissive
or
mandatory
in
the
project
act
and
the
secretary
had
constructed
the
dam
as
he
did
and
we
were
under
general
reclamation
law.
it
is
our
contention
that
that
is
a
valid
contract,
that
it
must
be
taken
into
account
and
that
in
any
court
decree
purporting
to
apportion
or
allocate
the
waters
of
river
we
would
be
entitled
to
that
amount
of
water
under
that
theory.
or
if
we
go
the
whole
way
and
assumed
there
was
no
allocation
and
it's
being
thrown
open
to
the
doc
--
division
of
the
water
under
this
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment.
then
it
is
our
contention
that
because
of
the
situation
of
nevada
as
a
sovereign
state.
and
again
accompanied
by
the
contracts
and
the
uses
which
we
have
initiated
and,
in
each
respect,
expanding
and
growing,
that
an
allocation
of
the
like
amount
of
water
would
be
justified.
the
only
point
that
i
wish
to
mention
very
briefly
under
the
general
subject
to
the
california
limitation
--
the
california
limitation
is
this,
that
it's
been
touched
on
i
think
by
some
who
had
preceded
me.
california
says
that
there
--
their
admi
--
their
four
million
four
is
to
come
out
not
of
the
mainstream
allocation
from
the
project
that
the
secretary
have
created,
but
from
a
system
wide
pool
in
which
the
gila
of
course,
is
the
main
contributor.
but
when
we
come
over
to
their
rights
under
the
water
the
million
acre-feet
allotted
to
the
lower
basin
by
article
iii
(b)
of
the
compact.
they
then
do
not
read
the
project
act
literally
because
to
the
extent
of
the
excess
or
surplus
water
in
section
4
(a)
of
the
project
act,
california
has
given
in
addition
to
this
four
million
four,
plus
not
more
than
one-half
of
any
excess
or
surplus
waters
unapportioned
by
said
compact
not
in
excess
of
3
(a)
or
anything
at
that
time.
and
if
you
look
to
the
compact
only
has
an
aid
in
construing
the
project
act,
i
find
to
believe
that
the
master,
and
perhaps
very
properly
lean
quite
away
over
on
the
side
of
california
in
finding
contrary
to
the
position
of
nevada
and
others
that
this
3
(b)
water
was
not
excess
or
surplus
water.
it
seems
to
nevada
that
the
master
likewise
was
acting
quite
properly
in
providing
to
put
in
his
decree
for
a
future
determination
of
these
present
perfected
rights.
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
perhaps
nevada
was
the
one
which
initially
requested
that
addition
to
his
draft
report.
the
reason
for
that
is
this.
as
i
say,
by
--
i
think
there
can
be
no
denial
that,
under
the
project
act,
they're
going
to
be
given
priority
and,
in
assessing
the
future
growth
and
development
of
that
section
of
the
river
in
that
part
of
the
united
states,
they
must
be
taken
to
an
account.
it's
our
thought
that
any
engineer
that
is
going
to
determine
the
feasibility
of
water
supply
for
new
and
additional
projects
must
necessarily
know
the
amount
of
water
which
had
prior
claims
as
present
perfected
rights.
to
take
our
nevada
situation,
each
time
there
is
additional
diversion
of
water,
there
--
it
is
necessary
to
install
extensive
and
expensive
pumping
installation
along
pipelines
and,
obviously,
any
bankers
that
are
going
to
put
up
any
money
are
going
have
to
be
persuaded
that
there's
water
available
and
so
also
for
the
people
who
will
be
taxed
for
it.
and
knowing
that
these
rights
are
prior,
it
is
quite
vital
to
know
the
extent
of
it.
i
think
that
the
discussion
this
morning
has
cleared
up
a
good
deal
of
the
question
of
what
a
present
perfected
right
is.
a
perfected
right
is
a
well-known
term
in
irrigation
in
the
west
as
different
from
an
in-court
right
or
an
initiated
right.
appropriations
sometimes
is
a
pretty
loose
term.
it
has
been
used
pretty
broadly
in
various
courts
and
various
legislative
body,
but
the
term
“perfected
right”
is
certainly
a
definite
and
precise
term
and
the
addition
of
the
word
“present”,
i
think,
was
unique
and
intentional
and
required.
it
--
like
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
originated
in
the
compact.
and
from
all
the
discussion,
is
whether
--
one
thing
is
obvious
and
that
is
that
they
were
trying
to
get
a
cutoff
at
some
time
and
to
get
that
cutoff,
it
had
to
be
something
definite
and
certainly
should
not
be
something
dangling
out
in
the
future.
if
the
colorado
river
is
typical
of
most
of
western
streams,
probably
if
we
went
up
and
down
the
stream
there
could
be
found
at
that
time
pending
a
multiplicity
of
notices
of
appropriation
in
the
filing.
i
think
a
mention
has
been
made
that
there's
someone
in
arizona
had
made
one
up
upstream
above
the
reservoir.
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
were
many
other
all
along.
now,
if
we
would
taken
an
interpretation
of
the
present
perfected
rights
which
would
say
that
any
right
that
came
along
in
the
future
that
was
perfected,
that
was
in
existence
at
some
time
--
of
some
character
that
time,
i
think
we
destroy
one
of
the
fundamental
aspects
of
the
decision
that
was
made
by
those
who
drew
the
compact
and
by
those
who
hammered
up
the
project
act.
the
--
it
could
even
amount
to
opening
the
door
to
unlimited
priorities.
there
has
to
be
a
cutoff
somewhere
on
any
kind
of
a
water
right
determination.
it's
inherent
in
it.
i
want
--
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
that
unless
there
is
a
cut
off
date
as
to
--
on
water
rights,
why,
that
prevents
others
who
maybe
have
done
something
prior
to
coming
in
ahead
of
you,
why
you
never
know
whether
you
have
a
valid
right
or
not
under
this
doctrine,
first
in
time
and
first
in
right.
i
think
it
all
show
--
also
should
be
mentioned
that
even
though
a
decision
should
be
made
that
this
is
not
a
statutory
allocation
suit,
as
has
been
stated,
that
doesn't
necessarily
turn
this
into
a
priority
suit.
i
think
there
had
been
some
question
raised
about
that.
the
--
we
think
that
the
secretary
had
the
right
to
make
these
allocations
that
he
made
by
contract
and
that
they're
valid.
if
for
any
reason,
i
can't
foresee
there'd
be
a
contrary
decision
as
to
whether
the
project
act
told
him
to
authorize
him
to
make
either
as
specific
allocation
or
as
government
counsel
contend,
a
flexible
authority
to
make
allocations,
certainly
under
the
project
act,
anyone
getting
water
out
of
that
reservoir
had
to
have
a
compact.
and
under
the
general
reclamation
act,
a
contract
is
the
basic
scheme.
the
--
in
my
opinion
any
valid
right,
for
instance
what
the
metropolitan
water
district
has
is
a
contract
right
and
that
if,
for
any
variety
of
reasons
it
was
decided
that
this
case
can
not
be
decided
under
the
allocation
theory
then
i
can
not
concede
of
any
situation
that
would
require
to
be
thrown
back
into
priority
suit.
that
in
addition
to
the
fact,
that
i
doubt
in
any
suit
or
variety
of
suits,
the
multiplicity
and
intensity
of
evidences
under
the
record
in
this
case
could
be
equaled,
let
alone
exceeded.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
just
necessarily
could
not
follow.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
the
master
did
not
say
that.
it's
the
united
states
that
says
that.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
no,
i'm
coming
to
that.
no,
i
think
there's
no
inconsistency
at
all.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
i
think
that
they're
--
on
the
contrary,
they're
entirely
inconsistent,
and
i
might
discuss
that
for
a
moment
at
this
point.
the
state
of
nevada
is
in
an
entirely
different
position
with
reference
to
its
contract
than
is
that
of
arizona.
the
basic
situation
is
determined
on
--
dependent
on
the
facts,
as
i
stated
them.
it
was
readily
recognized
early
in
the
picture
that
to
develop
this
las
vegas
area,
there
was
going
--
and
to
handle
the
power
that
was
set
aside
for
nevada
also,
that
there
needed
to
be
a
unifying
body
that
--
to
prevent
a
scramble
for
them,
for
the
power
and
for
the
water
and
so
forth,
and
that
could
supervise
the
gradual
and
it
was
hoped,
the
most
well-planned
development
in
that
area.
so,
the
state
of
the
nevada
passed
this
act,
which
is
set
out
in
detail
in
our
briefs,
both
in
the
body
and
appendix.
it
is
in
our
reply
brief,
for
the
last
time,
at
page
14,
and
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
that
is
the
contract
itself,
and
the
references
to
the
act
--
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
yes.
it's
in
--
it's
covered
in
the
briefs,
and
it
created
a
body
politic
acting
for
the
state,
and
then
commission
was
established
by
the
legislature
and
it
--
the
--
and
it
particularly
authorized
the
execution
of
a
contract
that
is
involved
in
this
action.
it
authorizes
the
commission
to
receive
the
water
covered
by
the
contract
for
the
state
of
ida
--
of
nevada
and
to
make
the
necessary
appropriation
for
it.
it
authorizes
the
commission
to
make
all
necessary
leases
or
subleases
or
contracts
for
the
use
of
the
water.
and
the
--
that
entity
has
been
the
one
that
has
been
taking
the
water
out
of
lake
mead.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
it
authorizes
this
commission
to
take
the
power
that's
allocated
to
nevada
and
to
distribute
it
those
who
are
entitled
to
use
it.
and
--
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
it
has
a
very
large
and
elaborate
power
organization,
i
might
call
it.
the
power
engineer
he
testified
in
this
hearing
and
the
record
shows
the
extent
of
the
quantity
of
power
and
it's
been
used
throughout
the
development
through
that
whole
southern
nevada
area.
lines
running
north
clear
to
the
extreme
northwestern
boundary
of
colorado
river
basin,
as
is
depicted
on
the
map.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
they
have
rea's
and
mining
developments
in
municipalities
and
--
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
yes,
very
generally.
and
it's
been
a
profitable
and
a
successful
operation,
and
the
state
of
nevada
is
--
this
body
of
the
state
of
nevada
is
actively
engaged
in
trying
to
promote
other
part
developments
in
other
dams
that
may
be
constructed
in
that
area.
it's
a
growing
concern.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
well
--
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
so
far
as
state
statute
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
and
i'd
not
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
project
act
makes
any
difference
rather
than
the
other.
now,
the
whole
of
the
nevada
contract
--
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
yes?
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
i
don't
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any
animation
of
that
until
the
course
of
this
argument.
it
was
discussed
at
some
length
before
judge
rifkind
and
it's
a
new
york
argument
where
in
his
original
draft
he
said
that
everybody
in
nevada
had
to
have
a
contract
like
arizona.
he
coupled
the
two
together.
we
filed
specific
written
exceptions
to
that
part
of
his
draft
report
and
government
counsel,
there,
argued,
as
i
understood
it,
not
that
nevada's
contract
was
invalid,
but
simply
that
it
had
to
be
accompanied
by
these
other
subsidiary
contracts.
now,
the
thing
that
bothers
us
is
just
a
practical
matter.
the
state
of
nevada
is
acting
to
its
colorado
river
commission
that's
in
business
and
has
facilities,
and
it's
delivering
water
to
factories,
and
it's
delivering
water
to
small
landowner
users
along
the
line,
putting
water
into
the
water
system
of
the
las
vegas
valley
water
district.
now,
another
--
we
aren't
--
in
nevada,
confronted
with
a
situation
such
as
down
in
arizona
where
it's
a
question
of
irrigation
projects
and
where
each
farmer
is
going
to
make
a
contract
for
his
irrigation
water.
if
you
say
contract
with
the
users,
how
far
are
you
going
to
go?
because
every
man
has
a
tap
in
his
yard
in
the
las
vegas
valley
and
he's
using
this
water
that
pumps
out
of
lake
mead.
is
he
going
to
have
a
contract
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior?
it
seems
to
me,
it
just
leads
inevitably
to
observed
results.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
yes,
this
large
chemical
plants
and
--
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
i
haven't
heard
any
raised
and
we
think
it's
the
but
--
the
most
efficient
use
have
been
made
by
the
water
in
the
colorado
river
valley,
and
those
who
drew
the
contract
with
the
state
of
nevada,
for
instance,
the
contract
itself
says
that,
the
united
states
shall
deliver
to
that
state
in
article
iv
(a).
and,
now,
on
the
contrary,
the
arizona
contract,
the
comparable
paragraph
says
that
it
will
deliver
water
to
such
political
subdivisions
of
arizona
as
may
contract
with
the
secretary.
i
can't
see
any
magic
where
a
political
subdivision
of
arizona
can
have
any
greater
standing
than
the
state
of
nevada
acting
through
its
own
agency.
it
seems
to
me
it's
of
higher
decree,
and
that
the
state
of
nevada
clearly
can
qualify
as
a
user,
as
a
person
using
water
under
the
general
broad
language
of
the
statute.
and
--
the
contract
with
nevada
particularly
provides
that
nevada
shall
pay
a
charge
of
50
cents
per
acre-foot
and
that
the
state
shall
pay
it.
and
all
the
way
through
the
whole
body
of
the
contract
is
a
relationship
in
which
the
state
is
the
user.
now,
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
it's
an
efficient
way
to
handle
the
situation
that
the
--
any
other
situation
would
lead
only
to
chaos.
now,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
of
what
--
nevada
has
the
right
to
this
water
and
if
we
take
the
extreme
wording
that
this
contract
is
invalid,
i
think
we
impressively
have
--
would
have
the
right
to
go
back
and
say
here,
"we
want
to
do
a
different
contract
and
i
can't
believe
that
there's
any
contract
could
be
written
which
would
work
more
efficiently."
now,
i
think
perhaps
we're
overly
belaboring
what
might
be
a
minor
point
but
it
is
of
considerable
importance
to
the
state
of
nevada,
just
from
an
operating
point
of
view.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
yes.
well,
i
think
domestic,
your
honor,
is
generally
been
interpreted
broadly
enough
to
include
industrial
uses
and,
as
i
say,
this
water
is
so
valuable
that
the
major
use
there
in
nevada
is
for
domestic
use.
