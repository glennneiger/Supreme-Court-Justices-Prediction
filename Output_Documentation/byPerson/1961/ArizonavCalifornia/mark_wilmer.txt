mr.
mark
wilmer
may
it
please
the
court.
arizona's
case
brief
itself
naturally
into
two
parts.
the
first
being
the
controversy
between
the
states
over
the
colorado
river,
the
interstate
controversy
mainly
arizona
versus
california
in
that
we
are
supported
largely
in
the
master's
--
in
upholding
the
master's
report
by
united
states
and
by
nevada.
the
second
portion
of
the
controversy
which
is
really
almost
a
separate
controversy
involves
the
dispute
between
arizona
mainly
and
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
claims
of
the
united
states
for
federal
establishments
mainly
the
reservations
on
the
colorado
river,
the
indian
reservations.
because
of
that
of
the
fact
that
in
one
sense
we
are
appellee
here
insofar
as
california
is
concerned
and
that
we
mainly
support
the
master's
report,
we
have
yielded
to
california
our
plaintiff's
position
to
open.
however,
with
respect
to
the
united
states
in
effect,
we
are
the
appellant.
and
therefore,
with
the
court's
permission,
we
propose
to
divide
our
argument
as
i've
indicated.
i
will
discuss
the
arizona
position
and
the
reasons
why
we
believe
the
master's
report
fundamentally
is
sound.
and
mr.
reed,
in
turn,
will
discuss
with
you
arizona's
views
with
respect
to
the
apportionment
made
to
the
federal
establishments
and
particularly,
the
indian
reservations.
i
expect
to
use
approximately
four
hours
of
our
allotted
time
and
mr.
reed
approximately
an
hour
and
a
half.
please
the
court,
some
36
years
ago,
justice
holmes
in
an
opinion
written
for
this
court
in
sanitary
district
of
chicago
versus
the
united
states
could
very
well
have
been
using
language
which
we
think
appropriate
to
this
case.
he
first
discussed
the
great
issues
involved,
the
claims
of
the
sanitary
district
of
chicago
as
to
the
vast
amounts
of
money
which
had
been
expended.
he
then
turned
to
their
claims
of
the
great
importance
for
many
billions
of
people
residing
in
the
chicago
area.
he
then
said
after
having
summarized
the
issues
as
presented
by
the
pleadings,
this
brief
summary
of
the
pleadings
shows
the
importance
and
gravity
of
this
case.
but
importance
and
gravity
alone
do
not
tend
to
impede
the
ability
to
decide
the
case.
the
exact
language
were,
do
not
stand
in
the
way
of
a
quick
decision.
he
then
said
the
mere
fact
that
great
sums
were
involved
and
that
the
millions
--
the
welfare
of
millions
of
people
is
involved
does
not
do
more
than
ten
to
cause
disputes
which
would
less
mighty
interests
involved,
no
one
would
venture
to
question.
he
round
up
with
this
significant
phrase
dealing
there
with
navigable
water
as
we
are
dealing
with
navigable
water
here,
“the
law
is
clear
and
when
it
is
known,
the
material
facts
are
few”.
and
we
say
here
dealing
again
with
a
navigable
stream
that
the
law
is
clear
and
when
it
is
known,
the
material
facts
are
indeed
few.
this
great
record
undoubtedly
will
serve
as
a
repository
of
many
interesting
studies,
of
many
interesting
excursions
into
the
field
of
hydrology,
into
the
field
of
many
things
but
from
the
stand
point
of
relevancy
to
this
case,
it
is
our
belief
that
ninety
percent
of
the
record
is
in
the
same
category
as
was
characterized
by
justice
holmes
in
the
sanitary
district
in
chicago
case.
either
this
case
is
one
--
if
it
please
the
court,
in
which
to
take
it
by
a
mighty
phrase
which
senator
king
used
in
the
project
debates,
the
united
states
has
put
its
mighty
hands
down
upon
the
river
and
has
you
surfed
its
flow
has
laid
aside
all
other
lesser
interests
except
in
supplier
as
to
that
they
indicated
a
contrary
purpose,
either
that
or
else
despite
the
fact
that
under
the
navigations
of
under
the
par
which
the
congress
has
under
the
commerce
clause
when
they
can
call
of
a
navigable
river.
it
has
expended
these
great
sums
to
store
the
entire
flow
of
the
colorado
river.
it
has
expended
these
great
sums
in
building
that
works
that
are
involved.
and
this
court
has
said
it
has
done
so
constitutionally
under
the
commerce
clause.
either
that,
as
we
have
said
or
else
as
california
would
request
this
court
that
river
still
flows
as
it
was
want
to
flow,
the
river
is
still
a
course
as
its
old
course
down
the
colorado.
we
say,
if
it
please
the
court
that
the
law
is
clear
and
that
the
material
facts
are
few.
significantly,
if
it
please
the
court,
despite
the
fact
that
the
special
master
relied
strongly
upon
the
chandler
dunbar
case
decided
in
1913,
upon
the
appellates
in
electric
case
decided
later,
upon
the
twin
city
power
case
but
despite
those
cases
which
the
master
relied
upon
and
which
arizona
and
the
united
states
relied
upon
as
ruling
this
case,
california
has
not
even
cited
those
cases.
we
suspect
that
perhaps
the
reason
is
that
it's
impossible
to
cite
them,
to
read
them
and
not
to
find
the
answer
to
this
lawsuit.
i
do
not
need
--
if
it
please
the
court
to
--
i
might
add
to
that
the
early
case
of
united
states
versus
rio
grande
irrigation
and
dam
company
in
174
united
states.
the
court
will
recall
that
that
was
a
case
in
which
this
court
examined
the
power
of
congress
unto
the
navigation
of
the
commerce
clause
and
in
the
light
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1890
and
1899,
in
that
case,
1890
because
the
1999
act
had
not
been
passed.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
with
respect
to
a
navigable
river,
anything
which
impaired
its
navigable
capacity
violated
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1890
and
in
that
case,
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court
in
new
mexico,
the
federal
district
court,
to
ascertain
if
in
fact
the
proposed
construction
of
this
dam
would
impair
the
navigable
capacity
of
the
rio
grande.
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
congress
under
the
commerce
clause
had
the
right
not
only
to
demand
no
obstructions
to
the
flow
of
a
navigable
stream
itself
but
had
the
right
to
reach
up
into
a
tributaries
if
interference
on
the
tributaries
impair
the
navigable
capacity
of
the
stream
below.
i
make
that
point
because
i
think
it
will
become
quite
important
later
in
our
discussion
with
respect
to
the
so-called
truncation
of
the
colorado
river.
it
is
our
position
briefly,
if
it
please
the
court
that
the
position
of
the
upper
basin
in
this
case
is
of
no
more
consequence
than
the
rights
of
massachusetts
or
new
york.
this
case
is
solely
a
case
of
statutory
construction
of
the
project
act.
this
case
no
more
involves
the
rights
of
the
upper
basin
than
it
involves
the
rights
of
mexico.
congress
in
enacting
the
project
act,
in
our
review,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
spoke
under
its
dominant
servitude
which
this
court
has
called
“a
power
over
navigable
water”,
a
dominant
power
not
in
terms
of
property
but
in
terms
of
power.
in
the
project
act,
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
exercising
the
power
which
resides
in
it
by
a
virtue
of
the
constitution
has
put
the
river
water
in
its
pocket.
it
has
bonded
up
in
lake
mead
and
it
is
then
said
how
this
water
is
to
be
distributed.
i
don't
care,
if
it
please
the
court
whether
congress
talked
about
3
(a)
or
3
(b)
or
3
(c),
the
decisive
question
before
this
court
is,
”what
water
did
congress
have
in
mind?”
whatever
terms
it
may
have
employed
become
wholly
immaterial
if
it
is
clear
what
water
it
was
talking
about.
i
say
again,
if
it
please
the
court
that
if
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history,
from
the
surroundings
which
existed
at
that
time
that
congress
was
talking
about
mainstream
water
which
it
was
going
to
store
at
lake
mead
and
which
it
was
going
to
direct
the
apportionment
of
then
the
terminology
used
to
tell
us
what
it
intended
becomes
relatively
important.
the
master
has
said
that
the
congressional
reference
to
3
(a)
of
the
project
act
related
to
a
fourth
hand
method
of
describing
the
first
7,500,000
acres
available
for
consumptive
use.
arizona
has
disagreed
to
one
extent.
we
fully
agree
with
the
master
that
what
the
congress
was
talking
about
was
at
first
7,500,000
available
for
consumptive
use
in
the
lower
basin
each
year.
the
master
has
said
that
3
(a)
constitutes
an
appropriative
ceiling
against
the
upper
basin
and
necessarily
if
it's
a
appropriative
ceiling
against
the
upper
basin,
it
has
to
be
with
respect
to
the
mainstream
because
you
don't
get
an
appropriative
right
against
the
source
of
water
that
you
don't
have
access
to.
so
our
tributaries
have
no
access
to
the
upper
basin,
therefore,
it's
a
short
junk
in
the
master's
position
to
our
position.
but
i
do
not
propose,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
pursue
at
length
any
attempt
of
interpretation
of
the
compact.
the
master,
at
the
outset
turned
to
the
delphic
instrument
and
he
said,
“each
time
you
shake
the
kaleidoscope,
you
get
a
different
picture”.
i
think
that
is
true.
but
because
it
is
irrelevant,
because
the
master
has
held
it
irrelevant
and
because
we
agree,
we
do
not
propose
to
pursue
an
interpretation
of
it
because
it
would
serve
no
purpose.
it's
nice
to
debate
how
many
angels
can
dance
in
a
point
of
a
pin
but
unless
it
becomes
of
some
consequence
in
the
lawsuit,
best
be
laid
aside
at
least
in
the
court
of
this
dignity.
mr.
mark
wilmer
right.
yes
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
say
that
whatever
congress
said
and
congress
stored
this
water,
whatever
terms
congress
used
if
it
is
clear
what
water
it
was
talking
about
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
certainly,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no.
please
the
court,
mr.
--
mr.
judge
murnaghan,
i
believe
at
one
time
made
a
very
wise
observation
at
a
(inaudible)
jurisprudence
is
not
--
does
not
look
to
the
dictionary
as
a
fortress.
it
looks
to
the
words
and
it
looks
to
the
--
the
purpose
that
the
congress
is
attempting
to
achieve
and
then
interpret
the
statute
in
the
light
of
that
purpose
which
the
congress
was
going
to
achieve.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no
your
honor,
i
certainly
would
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor
i
--
if
i
could
capture
my
argument
and
quickly
cover
the
legislative
history,
i
would
be,
i
think
justified
in
the
--
taking
the
position
i
have
taken.
i
think
that
no
one
and
i
say
this
advisedly
no
one
can
read
the
legislative
history
in
the
light
of
the
environment
then
existing
and
come
to
the
conclusion
other
than
that
the
congress
was
speaking
of
mainstream
water
at
lee
ferry.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
will
accept
that,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
am
most
happy
to
accept
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
i
was
trying
to
say.
i
put
it
that
way.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
agree.
yes
your
honor.
we
have
minor
what
i
would
call
--
i
supposes
it's
matter
of
attempting
to
justify
a
position
taken,
the
end
result
is
the
same
whether
you
call
our
position
of
3
(a)
right
or
the
master's
position,
the
end
result
is
the
same.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
believe,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
3
(a),
if
the
matter
was
before
the
court
for
the
compact
not
the
project
act,
but
compact
was
before
the
court
for
consideration
today,
we
would
be
urging
that
3
(a)
and
3
(b)
are
correlative.
that
in
fact,
what
3
(b)
means
is
a
leveling
out
of
the
3
(a)
demand
from
the
upper
basin.
your
honors,
yesterday
we
saw
how
erratic
this
river
is.
you
saw
how
the
flows
are
up
and
down.
it's
our
belief
that
the
upper
basin
demand
this
safety
valve
against
the
year
when
they
would
have
a
short
supply
and
in
favor
of
a
year
when
they
would
have
a
long
supply.
in
other
words,
if
you
look
at
the
record
of
the
flow,
you'll
see
some
years
where
there's
very
little
water.
i
mean,
by
that
down
to
either
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
do.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
accept
the
result,
your
honor.
we
accept
that
as
a
sound
conclusion.
now
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
if
it
please
the
court,
we
do
not
believe.
i
say
this
again,
we
do
not
believe
the
compact
is
here
for
construction
by
the
court.
we
believe
the
project
act
is
here
for
construction
by
the
court
and
that
whatever
the
congress
said
in
the
project
act
is
what
governs.
what
the
--
what
these
seven
men
thought
in
1922
or
what
their
secret
beliefs
or
thoughts
or
discussions
were
or
even
their
stated
words
becomes
completely
immaterial,
as
we
see
it.
when
we
see
what
congress
said
when
it
enacted
the
project
act
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
believe
that
the
reference
in
the
project
act
to
3
(a)
in
the
compact
means
what
the
master
said
it
does.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
it
means
the
first
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
water
released
or
available
rather
in
the
lower
basin,
the
rest
is
academic.
if
the
upper
basin
were
here,
perhaps
we
might
debate
the
matter
but
they're
not
here
and
they're
not
necessarily
here
because
in
the
hinderlider
case,
this
court
construed
the
compact
which
involved
four
states
with
only
two
present
because
only
two
states'
rights
were
involved.
and
here,
the
impact
of
this
decision
cannot
reach
to
the
upper
basin
because
we're
not
construing
the
compact.
we're
construing
a
statute
passed
in
1929
which
has
reference
only
to
a
supply
coming
down
from
the
upper
basin
in
which
does
not
pretend
to
reach
into
the
upper
basin
and
ask
or
demand
any
water.
in
fact,
if
it
please
the
court,
counsel
yesterday
talked
of
section
18
of
the
project
act
which
you
will
recall,
in
substance
provides
that,
”no
local
waters,
no
local
rights
shall
be
invaded,
shall
be
impaired
or
otherwise
affected
by
the
project
act”.
the
exact
language,
“nothing
herein
shall
be
construed
as
interfering
with
such
rights
the
states
now
have
either
their
water
within
their
borders
or
to
adopt
such
policies
in
the
next
such
laws
that
they
may
deem
necessary
with
respect
to
the
appropriation
control
and
use
of
waters
within
their
borders
except
--
except
as
modified
by
the
colorado
river
compact
or
other
interstate
agreement”.
the
contention
which
california
makes
is
perhaps
plausible
but
when
this
project
act
is
read
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
history
and
of
the
conditions
then
persisting
--
then
existing,
when
we
read
in
this
project
act
the
great
care,
the
actual
overemphasis
upon
protection
that
the
upper
basin
demand,
we
understand
what
this
means.
the
court
will
recall
the
master
said
that
the
peers
of
the
upper
basin
were
against
the
quick
development
of
the
lower
basin.
wyoming
versus
colorado
had
been
decided
in
1922
and
from
that
point
forward,
the
peers
of
the
upper
basin
increased
because
of
the
recognition
of
the
doctrine
of
prior
appropriation
in
an
equitable
--
equitable
apportion.
this
language
in
substance
says
what?
it
says
that
the
rights
of
the
upper
basin
are
preserved
and
are
not
affected
by
this
act
with
one
exception
as
modified
by
colorado
river
compact
--
as
modified
by
the
colorado
river
compact.
we
say,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
section
18
is
a
barrier
which
the
upper
state
erected
as
between
the
upper
and
the
lower
basin
states
to
be
sure
nothing
pass
through
that
barrier
by
virtue
of
the
project
act
except
the
burden
they
assume
under
the
compact.
so
i
say
again,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
rights
of
the
upper
basin
are
not
involved
and
cannot
be
involved
because
they're
not
affected
by
the
project
act.
and
the
project
act
stands,
if
it
please
the
court,
as
the
sole
instrument
before
this
court
for
interpretation
as
the
rights
of
the
states
because
congress
did
bottle
up
on
that
water,
congress
did
put
the
hand
--
mighty
hands
of
the
united
states
down
upon
that
stream
and
it
did
take
it
into
its
custody
and
did
apportion
it.
if
i
might,
digressing
for
a
moment,
please
the
court,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
because
we
have
not
have
the
advantage
of
it
at
this
point
to
just
briefly
review
the
geography
of
the
area
and
some
of
the
background
which
existed.
again,
if
i
might
use
the
words
of
a
great
jurist
learned
hand,
he
said
that
where'd
you
like
chameleons
which
take
their
color
from
their
environment.
and
i
think
we
need
to
know
the
environment
that
existed
when
the
project
act
was
passed
to
understand
the
full
impact
of
the
words
which
are
contained
in
the
project
act.
briefly
and
i'm
sure
the
court
has
perhaps
read
this
many
times,
the
colorado
river
is
--
as
the
master
said
the
stream
of
continental
proportions.
it
is
the
third
largest
in
the
united
states
surpassed
only
by
the
rio
grande
and
the
mississippi
that
extends
approximately
1300
miles
generally
as
you
saw
in
the
map
yesterday
in
the
northerly
and
the
southerly
direction
rising
in
the
high
peaks
of
colorado
some
14,000
feet
high.
it
extends
to
colorado
245
miles,
to
utah
285
miles
to
arizona
alone
295
miles.
it
is
the
common
border
of
arizona
and
nevada
445
miles.
it
is
a
common
border
of
arizona
and
california
for
235
miles
and
it
is
a
common
border
of
arizona
and
the
republic
of
mexico
from
16
to
20
miles.
so
immediately,
it
becomes
apparent
the
great
state
of
arizona
has
in
this
river
because
as
far
as
access,
as
far
as
it
being
a
part
of
arizona,
arizona's
contact
with
it
outweighs
down
of
all
other
states.
master
further
found
in
the
tables
are
in
the
report
and
i
will
briefly
cover
them
to
the
save
taking
it
up.
arizona
has
a
total
square
mileage
of
113,900
miles,
california,
158,693
miles.
and
arizona's
total
of
113,900
miles,
107,242
fly
within
the
drainage
basin
of
the
colorado
river
system.
california
has
3,599
miles
within
the
drainage
basin
of
the
colorado
river
system.
the
percentage
of
the
total
state
in
the
drainage
basin,
arizona
is
94
and
one
tenths
percent,
california
2
and
three
tenths
percent.
the
percent
of
the
entire
basin
in
the
state
of
the
entire
basin
44,
a
basin
system,
44
and
three
tenths
percent
is
in
arizona,
1
and
five
tenths
percent
in
california.
the
square
miles
of
the
state
in
the
lower
basin
of
arizona
100,306
california,
3599.
the
percent
of
the
state
in
the
lower
basin
that
is
of
the
entire
state
is
88
and
five
tenths
percent
against
california,
two
and
three
and
tenths
percent.
now,
it
is
true,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
in
the
past,
arizona
has
been
charged
with
being
rather
unreasonable
with
respect
to
this
river.
and
yet
i
think
this
figure
should
bring
home
to
its
very
quick
to
the
fact
that
arizona
has
to
be
a
little
unreasonable
because
this
is
a
sole
treasure
arizona
has.
this
is
the
sole
practically
access
arizona
has
to
life
getting
water
because
if
you
can
see,
practically
the
entire
state,
future
is
wrapped
up
in
the
colorado
river
and
therefore,
when
your
very
life
perhaps
as
a
state,
we
just
be
justified
perhaps
being
just
a
little
unreasonable.
if
i
might
pursue
that
matter
just
a
little
further,
the
upper
basin
is
noted
for
the
fact
that
it
is
at
very
high
altitude.
it
has
a
short
growing
season
of
three
to
four
months.
most
of
its
irrigable
areas
are
narrow
valleys.
the
access
to
irrigation
water
is
difficult,
costly.
on
the
contrary
in
the
lower
basin,
it
has
a
growing
season
almost
the
year
around.
it
has
broad
large
expanses
of
level
land
rather
usually
available
for
irrigation.
so
far
as
community
of
interest
is
concerned,
the
two
basins
are
separated
by
a
thousand
mile
canyon.
actually,
the
picture
which
shown
--
the
map
which
you
show
on
the
easel
yesterday
correctly
depicts
the
square
miles
of
the
two
basins
but
actually
they
should
be
viewed
in
a
shape
of
a
--
of
an
hourglass,
perhaps,
not
in
the
exact
--
it's
a
little
bit
of
a
crooked
hourglass
but
you
have
in
the
upper
basin
a
basin
which
is
in
itself
a
(inaudible).
you
have
a
thousand
miles
of
arid,
canyon,
difficult
country
where
the
river
flows
in
the
canyons.
you
have
the
lower
basin
or
you
have
the
level
land
and
the
long
growing
seasons.
i
say
this
--
i
bring
this
to
your
attention
for
mainly
this
reason,
there
is
absolutely
no
community
of
interest
between
the
two
basins
other
than
their
common
interest
in
the
river.
and
i
might
say
perhaps
the
fact
that
there
was
a
religious
interest
in
the
mormon
church,
the
good
people
of
utah
and
the
good
mormons
of
our
state
of
course
had
a
strong
religious
community
of
interest.
but
communication
is
practically
non-existent
in
the
century
nor
today.
new
york
and
chicago
was
more
accessible
to
arizona
than
denver
at
those
days.
so
that
these
things
are
important
when
we
come
to
consider
what
congress
was
talking
about
when
it
enacted
the
project
act
because
actually,
the
low
upper
basin
had
no
more
interest
in
the
lower
basin
than
it
had
in
mexico.
there
was
simply
nothing
there
other
than
the
one
common
treasure
that
they
both
sought.
they
both
desired
access
to
and
wanted
to
get
as
much
of
as
they
could
and
that
was
the
colorado
river
as
it
extended
from
the
upper
basin
and
to
lower
basin.
when
further
fact,
may
i
brought
your
attention
of
the
lower
basin
tributaries,
the
only
one
of
consequence,
of
real
consequence
is
the
gila,
which
empties
into
the
colorado
river
above
the
city
of
yuma
and
some
20
miles
or
so
above
the
border.
in
the
early
days,
the
mexican,
the
imperial
liberation
was
to
(inaudible)
which
came
out
of
arizona
about
four
miles
above
mexico
when
down
into
mexico
followed
a
course
to
mexico
to
above
calexico
is
now
and
there
reentered
california.
so
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
upper
basin,
it
had
no
interest
whatever
in
the
lower
basin
tributaries,
it
couldn't
get
to
them,
they
weren't
accessible
to
it.
they
simply
used
a
hydrological
fact
that
water
doesn't
run
uphill.
so
that
the
only
fund
of
water
which
was
available
for
consideration
and
division
among
both
basins
was
the
mainstream
as
it
flowed
down
from
the
upper
basin.
it
would
be
assuming
that
the
upper
basin
desired
to
impose
upon
the
lower
basin
an
economic
ceiling
to
say
it
was
concerned
with
how
much
water
was
used
in
the
lower
basin
for
consumptive
use.
the
upper
basin
was
concerned
with
one
thing,
that
thing
was
how
much
water
have
we
got
to
give
them
down
below
under
threat
of
court
action.
the
lower
basin
was
concerned
with
just
one
thing,
how
much
can
we
shake
out
of
it?
how
much
can
we
force
them
to
give
us
to
supply
our
needs
under
threat
of
problems?
it
seems
crystal
clear
to
me,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
in
approaching
the
understanding
of
the
compact
act,
we
have
to
understand
that
the
upper
basin
had
no
interest
whatever
in
the
lower
basin.
it
had
no
interest
whatever
in
the
tributaries
of
the
lower
basin.
it
had
no
interest
whatever
in
their
supply
of
water
except
for
one
thing
to
put
on
the
bargaining
table
to
say
you've
got
so
much
water.
therefore,
you
shouldn't
ask
so
much
mass
but
to
say
that
the
upper
basin
without
any
competitive
position
at
all
with
respect
to
lower
basin
was
visibly
engaged
in
trying
to
apportion
the
water
of
the
lower
basin,
to
me
applies
in
the
face
of
reason.
there's
no
economic
motivation
for
it,
no
religious
motivation
for
it,
no
long
standing
history
of
rivalry,
nothing
--
nothing
to
say
that
the
upper
basin
should
give
one
concern
--
one
bit
of
concern
with
respect
to
the
supply
of
the
lower
basin,
it
was
concerned
with
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
and
that
is
how
much
of
this
common
treasure
must
we
surrender.
i
think
reason
should
supplant
the
actual
language
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
thank
you.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
your
honor,
i
agree.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i
was
trying
to
make
this
position
--
this
point
that
if
we
have
some
ice
cream
to
divide
up
and
we
both
have
access
to
it,
we're
going
to
find
out
how
much
ice
cream
we
bought
and
how
much
i
scoop
out
and
how
much
you
scoop
out
but
if
it
happens
to
be
a
pot
sitting
there
that
you
don't
have
any
interest
in
and
no
access
to
and
the
right
to,
i
would
say
that
there
are
statute
which
referred
to
that
division
would
have
to
be
given
an
unreasonable
construction
to
assume
that
you
had
some
rights
to
dig
in
this
bundle
of
water
over
here
which
you've
never
used,
which
you
can't
use,
which
you
can't
get
to
and
which
you
have
no
access
to.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
same
consideration,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
withheld
arizona's
ratification
of
the
compact
has
caused
the
upper
basin
to
refuse
to
pass
the
project
act.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
now,
as
i've
indicated,
it
is
arizona's
position
and
it
is
master's
position
in
which
we
will
highly
concur
that
this
is
the
statutory
construction
case.
this
is
a
case
which
involves
the
construction
of
the
project
--
boulder
canyon
project
act.
it
is
true,
after
the
master
found
the
compact
had
no
relevance,
after
he
had
said
that
it
is
to
be
laid
aside
and
has
no
consequence
in
this
case
because
it
is
what
congress
meant
when
it
passed
the
project
act.
he
then
said
however,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
court
may
not
agree
with
me.
on
the
chance
that
the
court
might
decide
to
construe
the
compact,
i
will
express
my
views
as
to
what
it
means.
and
he
then
went
on
to
several
pages
using
language
which
is
in
effect
as
california
has
told
you
except
that
he
did
limit
his
holding
as
to
3
(a)
that
it
was
an
inappropriative
ceiling
as
against
the
upper
basin
which
is
a
far
cry
from
–-
an
appropriative
ceiling
in
the
entire
basins.
the
court
will
look
in
his
--
the
master's
report
in
page
114,
i
believe
it
is
,
you'll
see
that
he
twice
holds
that
it
is
a
ceiling
in
the
lower
basin
only
as
against
the
appropriators
in
the
upper
basin.
in
other
words,
he
construed
the
compact
fairly
and
squarely
as
an
interbasin
instrument
and
he
said
this
3
(a)
is
a
ceiling
against
rights
in
the
lower
basin
against
the
upper
basin.
and
since
the
only
water
in
the
lower
basin
in
which
rights
could
be
obtained
against
the
upper
basin
would
be
mainstream
water
necessarily
we
have
reference
from
mainstream.
now
i
take
it
there's
no
point
in
going
into
a
discussion
of
appropriative
rights.
we
all
know
that
to
get
an
appropriative
right,
you
must
get
it
again
to
someone
else,
an
appropriative
in
the
vacuum
does
not
exist.
it
is
of
importance
only
because
it
gives
you
precedence
over
someone
else.
and
that
precedence
of
necessity
must
be
against
someone
else
who
has
access
to
that
water,
otherwise,
it
would
have
no
meaning
it'd
be
a
little
medal
you
pin
on
your
chest
and
say
i've
got
an
appropriative
right
but
so
what?
so
that
as
i
said
earlier,
it's
a
short
junk
from
arizona's
contention
actually
in
practical
effect
to
the
master's
conclusion
because
he
did
say
that
the
3
(a)
is
a
limitation
as
against
the
upper
basin
only
in
gaining
appropriative
rights.
he
then
went
on
and
discussed
it
at
some
length
and
used
general
language
but
he's
holding
is
as
i
have
told
the
court.
this
court
--
if
it
please
the
court
in
the
chandler-dunbar
case
if
you
recall
was
considering
the
question
of
excess
capacity
over
navigation
in
the
saint
mary's
river.
the
chandler-dunbar
company
there
was
seeking
compensation
for
loss
of
power
rights
on
the
basis
that
there
was
excess
capacity
in
the
river
above
the
requirements
of
navigation
and
therefore,
they
should
have
compensation
that
having
been
taken
by
the
congress.
this
court
said
in
that
case,
in
substance,
there
is
no
room
for
judicial
review
of
the
determination
of
congress
as
to
whether
this
water
should
be
taken,
there
is
no
room
for
review
as
to
whether
or
not
the
excess
water,
there
is
excess
water
and
if
so,
should
there
be
compensation?
it's
squarely
held
that
it
was
a
legislative
determination
by
the
congress
and
that
it
was
not
the
function
of
this
court
to
review
the
discretion
of
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
powers
under
the
commerce
clause.
now,
that
holding
has
been
cited
many,
many
times.
this
court
in
the
appellates
in
case
used
the
language,
“in
truth,
the
authority
of
the
united
states
and
the
regulation
of
commerce
on
its
waters'
navigability
in
a
sense
just
stated,
is
but
a
part
of
the
whole.
flood
protection,
watershed
development,
recovery
of
the
cost
of
improvements
to
utilization
of
power
are
likewise
parts
of
commerce
control”.
i
would
like
if
i
might,
to
repeat
again
that
last
statement,
recovery
of
the
cost
of
improvements
to
utilization
of
power
are
likewise
parts
of
commerce
control
because
i
think
that
will
bear
quite
heavily
upon
our
friends
in
california's
criticism
of
the
master's
truncation
of
the
river.
it
will
bear
quite
heavily
upon
the
notion
of
whether
or
not
arizona
or
california
for
that
matter,
could
go
above
the
river
and
stick
a
pipe
down
in
its
supply
in
the
mainstream
which
has
been
dedicated
by
congress
to
the
provision
of
water
pump
in
the
project
act
and
thereby
take
out
a
substantial
flow
of
water
from
that
river
because
--
i
would
come
to
this
in
a
moment,
the
project
act
requires
the
secretary
before
entering
into
the
project,
before
beginning
construction,
that
he
shall
make
a
determination
if
the
revenues
from
the
project
shall
be
sufficient
to
repay
its
cost
of
construction.
so
that
anyone
who
for
and
moment
would
stand
here
and
tell
this
court
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
congress
plainly
in
the
debates
looked
to
the
supply
at
lee
ferry
as
a
supply
of
water
plainly
told
the
secretary,
"before
you
construct
this
project,
you
shall
see
you
have
revenues
sufficient
to
repay
it”.
but
nonetheless
and
despite
that,
arizona,
california
or
anyone
else
could
interfere
with
the
water
supply
of
that
project
as
it
comes
in
lee
ferry
and
dam.
despite
or
in
addition
of
course,
you
have
rivers
and
harbors
act,
you
have
the
requirements
that
you
obtain
a
permit
from
congress
and
of
course,
you
have
to
have
the
congressional
approval.
i
merely
say
that
the
language
of
the
case
i
just
cited,
the
appelachian
electric
case
plainly
indicates,
plainly
indicates
that
as
a
part
of
the
commerce
clause
power,
that
the
powers
of
congress
go
far
beyond
just
the
matter
of
regulating
the
flow
of
the
river
but
extends
through
all
these
peripheral
--
peripheral
things
which
go
to
aid
the
exercise
of
this
power
by
congress.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
don't
think
he
made
it
constitutional
arguments,
your
honor.
the
argument
made
and
if
you
recall
on
the
map
there
was
shown
a
proposed
route
from
--
i
believe
it
was
bridge
canyon
and
the
argument
was
made
and
is
made
in
the
brief
that
this
construction,
the
master
would
permit
arizona
and
california
to
go
deep
in
the
river
above
the
lake.
and
i
say,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
can't
be
done
except
congress
authorizing
it.
and
if
congress
sees
fit
to
authorize
it,
i
then
say
it
becomes
more
concern
of
arizona,
california
or
this
court.
mr.
mark
wilmer
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
know
there's
one
thing,
a
very
outstanding
about
mr.
ely's
argument.
he
religiously
stayed
away
from
the
commerce
clause.
now
in
the
twin
city
power
company,
this
court
again
said,
“the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
the
flow
of
a
navigable
stream
originates
in
the
commerce
clause”.
maybe
i'm
a
little
out
of
order
reading
to
this
court
which
your
honors
yourselves
have
said,
but
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
just
cover
it.
that
clause
speaks
in
terms
of
power,
not
of
property.
but
the
power
is
a
dominant
one
which
can
be
asserted
to
the
exclusion
of
any
competing
or
conflicting
one.
the
power
is
a
privilege
which
we
have
called
a
dominant
servitude.
the
legislative
history
in
the
construction
of
particular
enactments
may
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
exercise
less
than
its
constitutional
power,
fell
short
of
appropriating
the
flow
of
the
river
to
the
public
domain
and
provided
that
private
rights
existing
under
state
law
should
be
compensable
or
otherwise,
recognized.
such
with
united
states
v.
gerlach
live
stock
company,
federal
power
commission
v.
niagara
power
company
suit.
i
might
say
in
passing,
california
did
cite
the
gerlach
case
only
to
misconstrue
it
and
to
state
that
held
something
which
it
goes
--
it
does
come
--
have
no
place
for
it.
they
said
it
recognized
and
established
appropriative
rights,
it
did
no
such
thing.
it
recognized
that
congress
could,
in
enacting
a
statute,
provide
for
compensation
that
it
could
exercise
less
than
the
whole
of
its
power
if
it
desire.
and
if
it
did
so
and
this
court
construing
that
case
held
that
it
did,
not
intend
to
exercise
the
full
extent
of
its
power
but
it
did
not.
but
this
court
for
one
second
indicated
that
the
congress
did
not
have
the
right
to
usurp
the
entire
flow
of
the
river
without
compensation
in
the
navigable
stream.
we
have
a
different
situation
here,
one
where
the
united
states
displaces
all
competing
interests
and
appropriates
the
entire
flow
of
the
river
for
the
declared
public
purpose.
now
we
say,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
we
have
here
a
situation
where
the
united
states
has
usurped
the
entire
flow
of
the
river
and
has
displaced
all
lesser
interests.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
perhaps
i
spoke
--
a
little
too
enthusiastically,
your
honor
but
what
i
meant
was
this--
but
i
meant
was
this,
that
the
united
states
in
building
boulder
dam
did
usurp
the
entire
flow
of
the
river.
it
did
stop
the
entire
flow,
it
did
bottle
it
up,
it
did
take
it
over,
it
did
take
it
into
its
control
and
possession.
and
thereafter
--
and
thereafter,
by
a
virtue
of
the
project
act
provisions,
it
released
some
of
that
but
we
do
say
your
honor
and
i'll
say
it
without
equivocation.
the
united
states
did
usurp
the
entire
flow
of
the
river
and
then
did
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
oh
no,
i
don't
mean
wrongfully
in
the
slightest
sense,
your
honor.
not
in
the
slightest
sense.
if
i
used
it
--
if
it
were
to
have
that
connotation,
i
--
i
made
a
mistake
in
using
that
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
i
used
it
in
the
sense,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
united
states
did
take
control
of
this
entire
flow,
did
set
it
to
assign
and
store
it
and
then
the
project
act
said,
“now
here's
how
we're
going
to
use
this
stored
water.
here
is
how
it
shall
be
used”.
mr.
mark
wilmer
certainly.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
and
nevada
a
certain
amount.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
that
in
fact
rather
is
we
believe
the
only
conclusion
that
a
reasonable
mind
can
come
to
in
reading
the
debates
and
in
reading
the
act
itself.
that
is
the
only
conclusion
that
we've
been
--
can
be
reached
is
that
when
congress
did
under
the
commerce
clause
and
this
court
so
held
in
the
first
arizona,
california
case,
constitutionally
could
build
the
dam
under
the
paragraph
in
the
commerce
clause.
justice
frankfurter
or
justice
brandeis
in
that
case
as
i
recall
laid
aside
the
consideration
of
the
general
welfare
clause
and
simply
said
we
do
not
need
to
reach
that
but
he
did
say
squarely
under
the
navigation
under
the
power
over
navigation
--
or
power
under
the
commerce
clause
over
navigation,
that
congress
could
constitutionally
take
over
the
entire
flow
of
this
river.
mr.
mark
wilmer
correct.
mr.
mark
wilmer
constitutional
question.
mr.
mark
wilmer
and
all
the
rest
of
it
is
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
judge
has
(inaudible)
of
the
litigation
your
honor
was
that
one
question.
mr.
mark
wilmer
and
the
--
and
the
court
cut
arizona's
(inaudible)
as
far
as
that's
concern
on
that
particular
point.
if
i
may
use
that
as
a
question.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well
i
think
if
it
please
the
court
we
feel
to
get
a
little
bit
of
the
environment
to
get
the
color
of
these
words
that
the
congress
used
before
we
start
to
construe
them
just
in
the
color
light
of
black
and
white
on
a
piece
of
paper.
now
if
i
might
just
briefly
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
think
i
stand
corrected,
your
honor.
i
--
i
certainly
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i
think
the
master
meant
that
it's
unnecessary
to
construe
the
compact
to
reach
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
wilmer
with
respect
to
the
project
act,
yes,
you
honor.
now,
i'm
certainly
not
going
to
trouble
the
court
with
a
review
of
the
entire
project
act.
there
are
about
four
or
five
provisions,
which
we
think
are
decisive.
we
would
like
first
to
just
briefly
touch
it
by
laws
to
indicate
the
fact
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
did
exercise
its
full
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
we
would
like
then
to
pursue
if
we
might
the
legislative
history
of
two
or
three
of
those
sections
because
they
are
most
in
like
then
we
would
like,
then
we
will
go
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
your
honor,
it
certainly
is.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
there
is
no
question
about
that
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
as
it
develops
and
the
words
of
the
managers
of
the
bill
and
the
managers
of
the
amendments
to
the
bill
are
crucial.
we're
glad
they
are
because
we
think
that
they
wholly
support
our
position.
i
should
say
if
it
please
the
court
that
beginning
in
1922,
the
first
of
what
were
known
as
the
swing-johnson
bills
was
introduced
in
congress.
introduced
by
the
honorable
phil
swing
from
california
representative
and
the
honorable
hyr
--
senator
hyrum
johnson
of
california.
i'm
sure
that
many
of
you
have
personal
acquaintance
with
at
least
senator
johnson.
the
original
swing-johnson
bill
as
introduced
for
a
little
resemblance
to
the
bill
as
finally
enacted
in
1928.
the
first
swing-johnson
bill
failed,
the
second
swing-johnson
bill
failed.
chiefly
because
of
the
opposition
of
the
upper
basin
as
has
been
indicated
to
you
yesterday,
arizona
refused
to
ratify
the
compact.
she
refused
to
ratify
it
because
there
is
no
allocation
of
lower
basin
waters
between
herself
and
california.
and
she
held
that
until
it
was
such
at
the
basin,
she
could
not
safely
ratify
the
compact.
because
of
that,
i
would
not
stand
here
for
one
moment
and
suggest
that
too
little
arizona
in
those
days
of
a
few
hundred
thousand
population
stood
in
the
way
of
mighty
california
but
stood
in
the
way
of
mighty
california
in
those
days
with
the
upper
basin
because
the
upper
basin
did
not
propose
to
permit
the
construction
of
this
storage.
permit
california
to
take
the
full
lower
basin
apportionment
and
leave
arizona
at
liberty
and
at
large
to
take
a
further
share
of
the
water
since
she
had
not
ratified
the
compact.
so
that
the
california
attempts
to
secure
that
into
the
project
act
failed.
now
i'd
call
your
honors'
attention
to
this,
that
arizona
was
not
unsympathetic
to
the
project
act.
colorado
river
as
has
been
indicated
was
an
erratic
and
a
violent
strip
because
its
flow
came
mostly
from
the
melt
of
snow
water
in
the
high
mountains
of
the
north
to
the
--
in
the
upper
basin.
its
flow
in
the
spring
was
sometimes
of
tremendous
proportions.
a
violent
destructive
plot
but
it
was
destructive
in
arizona
as
well
as
california.
yuma
in
the
lower
southwest
corner
of
arizona
border
(inaudible)
of
this
sled
as
did
the
california
interests.
so
arizona
was
not
unsympathetic
to
the
notion
of
either
the
compact
or
project
act.
she
merely
wanted
to
know
that
this
one
source
of
life
to
her
from
the
standpoint
and
development
should
be
at
least
equitably
apportioned.
the
third
swing-johnson
actually
it
was
two
thirds
in
johnson
but
only
one
of
which
is
recognized
and
that
is
the
one
that's
introduced
in
february.
beginning
with
the
third
swing-johnson,
we
began
applying
some
evolvement,
begin
to
find
some
development
attempting
to
adjust
the
claims
and
demands
of
the
upper
basin
and
in
favor
of
the
--
in
their
favor
and
attempting
to
give
them
some
measure
of
protection
at
the
same
time
attempting
to
induce
arizona
to
ratify
the
compact.
if
i
might
first
turn
to
the
project
act
as
enacted
but
i
will
cover
only
a
few
sections.
section
1,
the
first
portion
of
it,
after
the
enacting
clause,
provides
that
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
floods
and
this
is
found
in
either
in
the
master's
report
appendix
2,
i
believe
your
honors
or
the
arizona's
opening
brief,
appendix
b
page
9a,
“that
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
floods,
improving
navigation
and
regulating
the
flow
of
the
colorado
river,
providing
for
storage
and
for
the
delivery
of
the
stored
water
thereof
for
reclamation
of
public
lands
and
other
beneficial
uses
exclusively
within
the
united
states,
for
the
generation
of
electrical
energy
as
means
of
making
the
project
herein
authorize
a
self-supporting
and
financially
solvent
undertaking,
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
subject
to
the
terms
of
the
colorado
river
compact
hereafter
mentioned
is
hereby
authorized
to
construct,
operate
and
maintain
a
dam
and
related
works
in
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river
at
black
canyon
or
boulder
canyon,
adequate
to
create
a
storage
reservoir
of
the
capacity
of
not
less
than
20,000,000
acre-feet
of
water”.
now
may
i
say
this
at
this
point
(inaudible),
the
united
--
the
california
has
severely
criticized
the
master
for
saying
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
no
power
beyond
the
reservoir
and
the
dam.
that's
all
the
congress
gave
him.
they
said
the
secretary
might
construct
a
dam
and
create
a
reservoir
above
it
but
capacity
of
not
less
than
20,000,000
acre-feet.
so
that's
where
the
project
act
ends
so
far
as
the
secretary
is
concerned
as
of
the
top
end
of
that
reservoir
because
there
is
where
congress
ended
his
authority.
that's
what
congress
told
him
he
could
do
and
then
they
told
him
what
he
was
to
do
after
that.
if
i
might
then
turn
before
going
to
sections
4
and
5
to
section
6.
that
the
dam
and
reservoir
provided
for
--
the
dam
and
reservoir
provided
for
in
section
1
hereof
shall
be
used,
first,
for
river
regulation,
improvement
of
navigation
and
flood
control.
second,
for
irrigation
and
domestic
uses
and
satisfaction
of
present
perfected
rights
in
pursuance
of
article
viii
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
now
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
peculiar
language
of
that
phrase,
not
in
satisfaction
of
present
perfected
rights
but
in
satisfaction
of
present
perfected
rights
in
pursuance
of
article
viii
of
the
colorado
river
compact,
plainly
the
congress
had
some
reason
in
so
phrasing
their
language.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
think
it
was
this
your
honor.
now
i
have
to
--
article
viii
of
the
compact,
if
it
please
the
court,
provides
this,
it
first
says,
“present
perfected
rights
are
unimpaired
by
this
compact”.
it
then
says,
”when
storage
on
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river
in
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
upper
in
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
lower
basin
shall
have
been
provided
in
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river,
then
rights
of
users
or
appropriators,
if
any,
on
the
mainstream
as
against
users
and
appropriators
in
the
upper
basin
shall
attach
to
and
be
satisfied
from
water
storage
--
not
in
conflict
with
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact”.
it
is
our
view
and
in
this
we
depart
from
the
master's
conclusion
your
honor,
but
again
it
is
not
a
large
matter.
we
believe
that
the
project
act
did
not
intend
to
perfect,
to
--
to
protect
present
perfected
rights
per
se.
we
believe
that
this
language
was
intended
solely
--
solely
to
discharge
the
obligation
contained
in
the
article
viii
of
the
colorado
river
compact
solely
to
provide
that
we
have
now
discharged
the
burden
laid
by
the
upper
basin
compact.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
if
it
please
in
court,
we
would
have
them
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
excuse
me.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor,
may
i
express
it
this
way.
first
of
all,
the
question
of
the
extent
of
rights
in
the
lower
basin
is
indeed
a
(inaudible).
we
have
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
in
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1890
and
1899,
the
congress
forbade,
forbade
under
criminal
sanctions,
anyone
impairing
the
navigable
capacity
of
a
stream
and
as
summers
once
said,
“i
don't
know
how
you
get
more
impair
the
navigable
capacity
of
a
stream
than
taking
all
the
water
out”.
so
we
would
say,
first
of,
whether
you
can
gain
any
appropriative
rights
in
a
navigable
stream
by
exhausting
its
flow
without
the
consent
of
congress,
indeed
presents
the
authority
question.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
understand,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
by
present
perfected
rights
coupled
with
and
tied
to
in
pursuance
of
article
viii
of
the
colorado
river
compact,
it
limited
the
present
perfected
rights
protected
to
those
which
the
colorado
river
compact
intended
to
protect
and
those
which
should
be
protected
under
the
colorado
river
compact.
but
that,
if
it
please
the
court,
only
preserve
that
protected
those
against
upper
basin
appropriators.
it
did
not
protect
or
preserve
them
against
lower
basin
appropriators
intra
basin.
the
only
function,
if
it
please
the
court,
of
this
language
we
have
quoted
is
to
discharge
the
upper
basin
obligation
against
claims
of
the
lower
basin
mainstream
users
at
such
time
as
they
were
provided
storage.
in
our
view
but
isn't
it
again
it
isn't
a
matter
of
supreme
ones,
our
view
is
that
this
language
was
intended
solely
to
say
that
upper
--
the
lower
basin
appropriators,
once
this
storage
is
completed
had
no
further
claim
against
the
upper
basin.
it
was
not
intended
to
preserve
intra-
basin,
state
versus
state
in
the
lower
basin,
any
rights.
we
say
that
for
several
reasons.
one,
the
administration
of
the
river
with
a
prime
purpose
of
preserving
navigation,
controlling
the
floods
and
or
rather
protecting
against
floods
and
controlling
the
flow
is
incompatible
with
the
recognition.
mr.
mark
wilmer
if
it
please
the
court,
the
honorable
philip
swing
several
instances
we
have
quoted
used
this
expression
that
you
can't
read
the
english
language
other
than
that
article
viii
of
the
compact
discharged
appropriative
rights
in
the
lower
basin.
he
said
not
once
but
several
times
that
the
impact
of
article
viii
was
simply
that
you
took
stored
water
in
lieu
of
natural
flow.
in
other
words,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
lower
basin
said,
"we
are
content,
give
us
adequate
storage,
we're
content
to
accept,
we
are
content
to
accept
stored
water.
we
are
content
to
then
waive
any
further
rights
we
have
against
the
upper
basin
and
take
our
water
out
of
storage
because
we
get
what?
we
get
an
adequate
year
round
supply,
we
get
clear
distilled
water,
we're
released
from
the
floods
and
all
in
many
other
benefits
inherent
in
that
storage”.
there
is
nothing,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
i
know
of
which
justifies
the
conclusion
that
present
perfected
rights
are
to
be
preserved
absent
a
provision
for
piloting
the
natural
flow
to
the
reservoir.
you
don't
store
the
entire
stream
irrespective
of
its
natural
flow;
you
don't
give
a
person
downstream
gobs
of
water
as
he
asks
for
it
without
respect
to
his
appropriative
rights
and
say
yet,
appropriative
rights
are
preserved.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
think
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
act
substituted
stored
water
for
those
appropriative
rights.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
think
the
congress
contemplated
your
honor
that
there
should
be
allocated
ample
water
so
that
those
rights
would
be
protected.
i
do
not
think
the
congress
expected
that
those
rights
were
to
be
protected
in
the
sense
of
a
preservation
of
their
historic,
time,
quantity
and
amount
of
flow
at
a
given
point.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
in
particularly,
in
imperial
valley
prior
to
construction
of
the
project
act,
the
low
flow
in
the
summertime
was
inadequate
--
was
inadequate
to
service
that
just
been
claims
on
that
water
was
all
gone,
there's
been
when
the
crops
were
started.
congress
gave
in
place
of
those
rights
in
the
natural
flow,
which
is
inherent
in
an
appropriative
right
a
great
body
of
stored
water.
congress
said,
"we're
going
to
give
you
a
block
of
water
which
in
our
judgment
is
ample
to
give
you
year-round
water
not
just
when
it
would
naturally
come
to
you
by
virtue
of
the
normal
flow
of
the
river
in
a
state
of
nature”.
now
i
say
this,
it
if
it
please
the
court,
that
if
congress
set
aside,
if
congress
stored
the
entire
flow
and
said,
"this
is
to
be
used
to
satisfy
these
appropriative
rights.”
the
states
then
had
the
privilege
perhaps
of
saying,
"no
we
want
natural
flow.
we
refuse
to
give
up
our
appropriative
rights."
pile
up
our
natural
flow
to
the
river
and
give
it
to
us
as
it
was
want
to
flow
and
perhaps
it
would've
had
some
basis
for
complaint
but
they
didn't
do
that.
they
accepted
the
proper
of
congress
to
take
in
lieu
of
the
natural
flow
and
their
rights
in
the
natural
flow
a
stored
water,
a
body
of
stored
water
the
same
as
if
they
went
to
the
store
to
buy
some
bread.
it
was
there
in
ample
quantities
for
them
but
not
in
relationship
to
their
historic
method
and
time
and
place
of
taking.
now
the
only
distinct
that
i'm
going
to
draw
is
this
your
honor.
i
think
the
notion
of
present
perfected
rights
being
preserved
cuts
across
the
theory
and
philosophy
of
the
project
act.
i
think
congress
realized
that
it
was
storing
an
ample
supply
of
water
because
it
was
storing
it
all
and
then
it
was
going
to
allocate
that
out
not
according
to
the
natural
flow
but
as
people
wanted
it
to
the
extent
of
the
apportionment
it
made.
and
if
you'll
recall,
many
of
the
debates
in
congress,
particularly
in
the
senate,
in
the
second
session
of
the
70th
congress
which
was
all
in
the
enactment
of
this
act,
senator
johnson
was
asked
time
and
again,
"what
are
your
present
rights
in
imperial?
what
are
the
present
rights
in
california?”
and
at
one
point,
he
gave
a
figure
which
i
have
and
can
give
you
the
congressional
reference
to.
in
which
as
i
recall
he
stated
the
california
present
users
were
something
in
excess
of
million,
i
believe
159,000
in
that
general
order
of
magnitude.
those
were
the
present
uses
in
california.
those
were
how
much
california
was
then
using.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no
--
yes
he
did,
your
honor.
there
was
quite
an
exchange
which
is
quoted
in
our
legislative
history
between
he
and
senator
walsh
of
montana.
in
which
say
the
walsh
of
montana
asked
him
about
this
so
called
appropriative
right
of
los
angeles
and
he
said,
yes,
they
had
one
in
1924,
they
have
followed
notice
of
appropriation
for
a
million
and
i
believe
95,000
acre-feet.
and
senator
walsh
then
pursued
him,
"but,
what
have
you
done
about
this?"
well,
we've
spent
some
money
on
surveys
and
finally
forced
from
senator
johnson
that
concession
that
without
the
project,
they
couldn't
give
any
water.
finally
a
portion
in
the
agreement
that
absent
storage,
the
natural
flow
was
all
appropriated
and
that
there's
no
place
in
which
they
could
get
the
water
other
than
storage.
that
discussion
did
occur
your
honor
and
a
round
up
would
be,
i
would
say
concession
on
the
part
of
senator
johnson
that
california's
paper
filing
which
without
value
unless
there
was
storage.
that
was
recognized
and
add
that
for
the
2,100,000
and
some
thousand
you've
got
3,000,000
and
some
thousand.
now
i
might
say
and
i'm
the
aggressor
a
little
bit
here
but
i
want
to
make
this
point
of
--
this
point
because
we've
had
considerable
talk
about
it.
in
the
course
of
this
discussion,
in
the
--
in
the
second
session
the
70th
congress,
senator
johnson
(inaudible)
it
up
what
he
said
was
the
total
requirements
that
california
would
need
ultimately.
he
thinks
that
the
million,
i
believe
nine
thousand
--
six
--
i'm
sorry,
a
million
and
nine
thousand
and
he
totaled
all
out
there.
and
then
he
discussed
the
governor's
conference
which
i
want
to
come
in
a
minute
which
has
taken
place
in
1927
and
he
used
the
significant
word
which
i'm
going
to
quote
to
you
in
(inaudible)
a
little
later.
we
agreed
to
take
4,600,000
recognized
it
and
we
aren't
getting
enough
water.
we
agreed
to
take
6,000,000
--
4,600,000
in
effect
to
get
this
project
underway,
recognized
that
this
wasn't
sufficient
to
take
care
of
all
our
needs
and
that
we
were
taking
a
calculated
risk.
to
get
the
project
act
passed,
california
did
take
the
calculated
risk.
and
now
having
got
the
project
act,
she
wishes
she
hadn't
taken
that
competitive
risk
(inaudible).
now,
in
any
event
your
honor,
i'm
going
to
come
back
to
this
in
respect
to
the
master's
treatment
of
present
perfected
rights
and
if
i
might
and
if
the
court
will
permit
me,
i
will
defer
at
this
moment
further
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
discussing
this
point.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
i
--
i
said
that
isn't
the
right
thing
senator
johnson
said
there,
the
likelihood
of
wherever
being
any
question
shortage
is
remote,
it
really
isn't
something
that
we
need
to
get
too
excited
about,
although
i
would
have
at
this
point
in
passing
correct
mr.
ely
when
he
said
that
the
master's
shortage
apportionment
cut
across
established
rights.
the
report
expressly
provides
that
in
the
event
of
shortages,
present
perfected
rights
are
fully
paid,
are
fully
taken
care
of
and
then
the
shortage
is
apportioned.
i'm
sure
mr.
ely
spoke
as
it
at
least
as
we
read
the
master's
report
his
holding
squarely
was
an
untimely
shortage
present
perfected
rights
take
precedence
and
thereafter
the
--
the
water
--
(inaudible)
water
is
shared
(inaudible).
now
i
want
to
just
--
again
refrain
to
section
6.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
--
i'm
skipping
to
the
second
paragraph,
shall
prescribe
and
enforce
rules
and
regulations
with
the
--
conforming
with
the
requirements
of
the
federal
power
act
as
far
as
after
who,
respecting
the
maintenance
of
work,
conditions
of
repair
adequate
to
their
efficient
operation,
maintenance
of
system,
accounting
control
rates
and
so
on
relating
only
to
power.
he
then
--
then
further
provides
he
shall
also
conform
with
other
provision,
the
federal
water
power
act
and
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
federal
power
commission
which
have
been
devised
or
which
may
have
to
be
devised
for
the
protection
of
the
investor
and
consumer.
the
point
i
am
making
and
reading
this
is
only
this
your
honor
that
when
we
come
to
a
considerate
--
your
honors,
when
we
come
to
a
consideration
of
arizona's
position
that
4
(a)
and
5
of
the
project
act
constituted
a
mandatory
formula.
it
becomes
most
significant
to
find
in
the
project
act
detailed
treatment
--
detailed
treatment
of
how
power
shall
be
handled,
detailed
treatment
of
who
shall
get
it,
what
policy
shall
govern
and
if
there'd
be
conflicted
applicants,
they
shall
have
a
hearing
and
yet
in
the
disposition
of
this
most
precious
commodity
water,
we
find
only
the
language
that
the
secretary
shall
conform
with
the
provisions
of
article
4
(a).
i
want
then
to
go
if
i
may,
to
section
4
(a)
and
section
5.
they're
long,
i
am
not
going
to
read
them.
i'm
simply
going
to
note
two
things.
the
first
paragraph
of
section
4
(a),
as
it
was
finally
passed,
provided
for
either
a
six
or
a
seven-state
ratification
within
six
months
or
a
six-state
ratification
within
or
within
six
--
i'm
sorry,
provided
for
a
seven-state
ratification
or
if
that
did
not
occur
within
six
months,
then
for
a
six-state
ratification;
provided
further,
that
as
we
read
it
and
as
the
master
found
in
any
event,
the
project
act
shall
not
take
effect
until
california
shall
have,
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
other
basin
states,
enacted
the
limitation
act.
it
further
provided
in
paragraph
2
for
what
is
termed
the
permissive
compact,
it
simply
provides
that
in
paragraph
2,
unnumbered
of
4
(a),
that
the
three
states
were
authorized
to
enter
into
a
compact
dividing
the
7,500,000
in
accordance
with
the
way
it
was
divided
in
4
(a).
at
least
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
in
4
(a),
it
said
california
can't
take
more
than
4,400,000
that
therefore
there
was
a
2,800,000
and
300,000
left
for
arizona
and
nevada,
provided
for
certain
other
things
which
i
am
not
going
to
discuss
here.
then
provided
in
(b)
that
before
any
money
is
appropriated
for
the
construction
of
said
dam
or
power
plant
or
any
construction
work
done
or
contracted
for,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
must
make
provision
for
revenues
sufficient
to
ensure
repayment
of
the
act.
then
in
section
5
as
present
as
an
act,
it
provide
that
he
was
authorized,
the
secretary,
under
such
general
regulations
as
he
might
prescribe
to
contract
for
the
storage
of
water
and
its
delivery.
then,
if
it
please
the
court,
this
language
will
become
significant
and
will
be
heard
again
and
again.
contracts
respecting
water
for
irrigation
and
domestic
uses
shall
be
for
permanent
service
and
shall
conform
to
paragraph
(a)
of
section
4
of
this
act.
no
person
shall
have
or
be
entitled
to
have
the
use
for
any
purpose
of
the
water
stored
as
aforesaid,
except
by
contract
made
as
herein
stated.
the
master
has
held
and
arizona
agrees
that
congress
intended
by
this
provision
to
prohibit
the
use
of
any
water
stored
pursuant
to
these
works,
other
than
by
contract;
but
that
was
the
intent
of
it.
now
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to,
in
reviewing
the
legislative
history
of
this
matter,
first
turn
to
the
governor's
conference
of
1927
that
is
found
in
the
last
page
of
the
arizona
legislative
history.
it
is
printed
in
various
other
places
but
if
you
will
turn
to
the
last
two
pages
158
and
159,
the
recommending
--
the
recommendations
of
the
governor's
conference
are
set
forth.
i
would
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
up
to
this
point
in
1927,
the
swing-johnson
acts
have
been
appointed
and
rejected
in
the
congress
and
at
denver
in
1927,
in
september
and
first
part
of
october,
the
seven
governors
of
the
seven
basin
states
met
at
denver
in
a
conference.
it
is
apparent
it
was
quite
a
conference
because
we
will
see
later
senator
pittman
was
there.
we
know
that
delph
carpenter
was
there
from
his
testimony.
we
know
that
senators
phipps
was
there
from
his
testimony.
therefore,
we
can
assume,
i
think,
without
stretching
the
record
that
it
was
quite
a
conference.
it
was
attended
by
all
of
the
prominent
water
people
of
the
seven
basin
states
involved.
its
purpose,
to
try
to
work
out
this
conflict
between
arizona
and
california,
to
try
to
work
out
some
kind
of
a
meeting
of
the
minds
so
to
speak,
whereby
arizona
would
ratify
the
compact
and
the
project
act
could
be
enacted.
it
is
significant,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
one
of
the
governors
attending
this
conference
was
governor
emerson,
frank
emerson,
who
had
been
one
of
the
compact
negotiators
for
the
state
of
wyoming.
it
is
significant
that
from
his
testimony,
delph
carpenter,
another
of
the
negotiators
of
the
commissions
of
the
compact
was
in
attendance
of
this
conference
because
from
his
testimony
in
the
congressional
hearings,
we
know
he
was
there.
now,
i
say
in
passing
that
we
have
here
the
people
concerned
who
are
most
vitally
affected,
the
upper
basin
states.
finally,
the
four
governors
of
the
upper
division
states
new
mexico,
utah,
wyoming
and
colorado
sat
as
arbitrators
--
sat
as
arbitrators
to
determine
what
should
be
the
division
made
to
the
lower
basin.
i
have
mentioned
the
names
of
the
arbitrators
because
it
seems
to
me
that
they,
particularly
carpenter
and
emerson
must
have
been
keenly
aware
of
the
exact
obligation
of
the
upper
basin
under
the
compact.
the
governors
there
recommended
of
the
average
annual
delivery
of
water
to
be
provided
by
the
states
of
the
upper
division
at
lee's
ferry
under
the
terms
of
the
colorado
river
compact,
300,000
to
nevada,
3,000,000
to
arizona,
4,000,000
to
california.
secondly,
that
arizona
should
have
the
unequivocal
use
of
a
million
acre-feet,
the
colorado
river
tributaries
employing
in
the
state
with
reference
to
mexico.
significantly,
in
paragraph
3,
these
governors
of
the
upper
state
--
of
the
upper
basin
recommended
that
as
to
the
all
lower
basin
tributaries,
they
should
go
to
the
states
in
which
they
were
flowing
except
that
it
was
a
two
base
--
two-state
river
that
it
should
be
subject
to
division
between
the
states.
but
it
is
significant
that
these
four
governors
who
would
be
most
interested
in
the
lower
basin
tributaries
if
they
were
in
fact
involved,
recommended
that
they
be
given
to
the
states
of
the
lower
basin
free
and
clear
and
without
limitation.
why?
because
with
respect
to
the
mainstream
in
paragraph
5,
they
provided
arizona
and
california
may
each
divert
and
use
one-half
of
the
other
portion
of
water
of
the
main
colorado
river
flowing
at
below
lee's
ferry.
subject
to
further
equitable
apportionment
between
the
states
after
the
year
1963
quickly
turning
back
to
colorado
river
compact
in
article
iii
(f)
provided
that
after
1963
that
there
might
be
a
further
equitable
apportionment
of
the
unapportioned
water,
the
water
unapportioned
by
a,
b
and
c
upon
application
of
the
governor
of
any
state.
the
significant
thing?
lower
basin
states
were
not
tributaries
were
not
reserve
for
further
equitable
apportion.
mainstream,
excess
flow
was
reserve
for
future
equitable
apportion.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
this
recommendation
of
the
governors
we
believe
is
equitably
reflected
in
the
legislative
history
became
then
the
vehicle
--
the
vehicle
for
working
out
a
settlement
and
compromise
as
between
california
and
arizona
in
the
united
states
senate
because
arizona
and
california
still
could
not
agree.
arizona
demanded
4,600,000,
the
governor
recommended
4,200,000,
arizona
stood
under
3,000,000.
so
that
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
4,600,000
or
your
honor
i
can
best
answer
that
but
the
governors
were
referring
to
the
7,500,000
let
down
at
least
third.
so
the
exact
language
of
the
average
annual
delivery
of
water
to
be
provided
by
the
states
of
the
upper
division
at
lee's
ferry.
now
your
honor
engineering
wise,
hydrologically,
any
other
wise
we
want
to
choose
that
had
to
be
upper
basin
water
because
lee
ferry
i
analogized
the
minute
ago
with
respect
to
the
two
basins
as
an
hourglass.
the
upper
basin
is
defined
as
that
portion
of
these
states
which
naturally
drain
into
the
river
above
lee's
ferry
which
was
named
as
a
point
a
mile
below
the
mouth
of
the
perry
river
so
that
the
lee's
ferry
was
the
point
of
division.
it
was
in
effect
where
the
canyon
section
which
isolate
the
lower
basin
from
the
upper
basin
begun
to
ameliorate
something
although
the
grand
canyon
still
lies
below
it.
so
that
when
they
said
of
the
annual
delivery
at
lee's
ferry,
there
could
be
no
conflict.
there
could
be
no
claim
that
that
did
not
mean
upper
basin
water.
it
just
--
isn't
any
getting
away
from
it.
you
can
talk
until
you're
blue
in
the
face
and
then
were
at
everyone's
faces,
that
lawyers
who
are
very
intense
sometimes
do
have.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
and
i
think
it
does.
i
think
if
it
please
the
court
that
the
master's
holding
is
misunderstood.
he
has
said
that
the
secretary,
the
secretary
has
control
over
only
the
dam
and
the
reservoir.
i
would
not
for
one
minute
contend
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
that
congress
did
not
dedicate
the
water
at
lee's
ferry
to
the
uses
of
the
project
act.
there's
no
question
about
it.
they
did
because
that's
what
they
talked
about.
all
through
the
--
the
legislative
history,
as
we
will
demonstrate
there's
a
water
let
down
at
lee
ferry,
the
water
provided
at
lee
ferry.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
wouldn't
know
that
i
would
read
his
decision
your
honor
as
in
quite
that
light.
as
i
understand
the
master's
decision,
he
held
that
the
water
which
the
secretary
had
control
over
and
which
he
might
contract
with
respect
to
was
water
stored
in
the
dam,
in
other
words,
it
was
water
which
the
congress
had
authorized
him
to
store
and
to
manage
in
the
interest
of
navigation
and
to
then
apportion.
but
i
would
have
to
make
this
distinction
if
it
please
the
court
and
if
we
disagree
with
the
master
we
disagree
with
it.
i
do
not
think
you
can
read
the
legislative
history
of
the
project
act
particularly
in
the
third
–
in
the
second
session
of
the
70th
congress
and
conclude
other
than
that
congress
had
reference
to
the
supply
of
water
coming
from
the
upper
basin
that
it
was
to
be
stored.
i
do
not
think
it
can
come
to
the
conclusion
other
than
that
in
effect
was
dedicated
to
the
purposes
of
the
project
act
including
the
generation
of
power
and
including
the
related
phases
of
management
which
necessarily
inherent
in
that
type
of
thing.
but
all
congress
gave
the
secretary
power
to
do
was
to
build
the
dam
and
free
the
reservoir
and
then
manage
that
reservoir
but
that
doesn't
rule
out
the
fact
that
congress
was
looking
into
the
water
at
lee
ferry
as
a
supply
for
that
project.
and
that
doesn't
rule
out
the
fact
that
therefore
the
congress
has
preempted
the
flow
at
lee
ferry
for
the
purposes
of
the
project
act.
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
say
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
giving
control
over
that
water
until
it
gets
within
his
grasp
because
he
is
the
only
the
agent
of
the
congress.
the
congress
delegated
to
him
management
of
a
certain
supply
which
it
looked
to
for
this
reservoir.
the
--
the
significance
as
we
see
it,
if
it
please
the
court
is
that
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
suggestion
that
might
be
done?
there's
two
answers
to
that
your
honor.
your
honor,
the
master
gave
one,
which
was
that
no
one
can
do
it
without
the
consent
of
congress
and
if
congress
consents,
that's
congress'
business.
mr.
mark
wilmer
my
view
of
this
exactly
that
one
you
can't
--
you
can't
build
a
dam
and
take
water
out
off
a
navigable
stream
except
either
with
the
permit
of
the
secretary
of
water
or
the
consent
of
congress,
that
is,
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1890
as
amended
in
1899,
he
simply
can't
do
it.
secondly,
and
i
think
of
equal
cogency
is
a
statement
that
congress
has
set
aside
the
flow
of
the
river
as
it
comes
to
the
lower
basin
at
lee
ferry
for
the
purposes
of
the
project
act.
congress,
by
their
very
terms
of
the
debate,
the
very
terms
of
the
language
of
the
senators
who
finally
hammered
out
the
project
act
in
effect
said
the
supply
at
lee
ferry
shall
be
used
for
this
purpose
among
which
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
(inaudible)
has
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i
--
i
can
--
i
can
come
to
no
other
conclusion.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
master
did
say
that
this
was
not
a
matter
of
consequence
because
it
couldn't
be
done
without
the
consent
of
congress.
he
did
definitely
take
that
position.
we
did
not
urge
to
him
at
that
time.
i
think
if
he
had
pursued
it,
he
would
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
and
that
is,
that
in
addition
under
the
project
act,
none
of
the
congress
here
has
plainly
--
plainly
in
the
debates
and
in
the
committee
hearings
and
everything
else,
has
shown
that
it
was
looking
to
the
supply
of
water
from
the
upper
basin
at
lee
ferry
to
make
this
project
feasible.
now
to
me
its
maxim
of
a
--
of
a
what's
this
--
plain
nonsense
to
suggest
that
once
the
congress
having
dedicated
this
supply
of
water
at
lee's
ferry
and
i
defy
it
if
it
please
the
court,
anyone
who
come
to
a
contrary
conclusion
if
you
read
the
legislative
history
objectively.
congress
having
dedicated
that
supply
at
lee
ferry
to
suggest
with
the
straight
face
that
arizona
might
go
up
and
construct
the
dam
above
that
and
take
that
water
and
run
into
central
arizona,
i
just
don't
think
that
to
adds
up
i
don't
think
it
makes
sense.
mr.
mark
wilmer
above
lee
ferry
and
below
lee
--
i
mean
above
the
lake
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
and
below
lee
ferry?
mr.
mark
wilmer
just
physical
facts
would
deny
it,
but
it's
in
the
deep
canyon,
it's
impossible
to
get
to
but
that
isn't
the
answer
--
the
legal
answer
is
that
one,
the
water
is
been
set
aside
from
the
project
act
by
congress.
two,
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1890
and
1899,
you
can't
build
the
dam
in
a
navigable
stream
without
the
consent
of
the
secretary
of
water
or
of
congress.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
my
answer
is
--
is
two
things,
your
honor.
one,
the
two
projects
have
both
been
abandoned,
but
if
that
were
not
true
--
that
were
not
true,
it
could
not
be
done
without
the
congressional
approval
and
i
don't
know
of
any
better
power
to
give
us
authority
than
the
congress.
congress
has
stored
this
water
and
the
congress
wants
to
say
to
arizona,
we
authorize
you
to
take
some
additional
water,
they
are
not
going
to
say
we're
going
to
charge
you
for
the
lake
mead
but
this
is
a
body
of
water.
it's
as
if
the
situation
of
lee
ferry
was
a
fountain,
a
spring
as
far
as
this
lawsuit
is
concerned.
so
far
as
this
lawsuit
is
concerned
is
the
same
as
if
there
was
a
spring
at
lee
ferry
which
gushed
out
so
much
water
every
year
because
under
the
compact,
that
is
the
delivery
point
in
the
upper
basin
that
is
the
measuring
point
of
the
upper
basin.
and
it's
just
the
same
as
if
the
congress
have
said,
“that
supply
of
water
used
to
be
dam
by
the
construction
of
the
boulder
canyon
project,
it
is
to
be
stored.”
and
for
anyone
to
commit
and
say
well
the
state
of
arizona
or
the
state
of
california
may
(inaudible)
under
those
circumstances
in
deep
in
that
body
of
water
and
defeat
the
project
act,
defeat
its
purpose,
defeat
the
contracts
which
the
secretary
was
required
to
make
to
provide
revenue
by
depriving
the
project
of
water.
all
of
those
things
simply
the
reason
cries
out
against
them
and
there's
no
basis
for
concluding
that
the
congress
having
said
to
the
secretary,
“you,
in
effect
measure
this
water.
you
determine
how
much
of
a
head
you're
going
to
have
for
generating
electricity.
you
determine
how
much
of
a
supply
of
electricity
you're
going
to
have
to
sell
and
then
based
on
that,
you
determine
the
piece
if
only
the
project
and
go
ahead
and
build
it.
and
then
to
commit
and
say
despite
that
arizona
can
go
and
take
half
that
water
and
defeat
the
project,
defeat
the
computation
of
the
secretary”.
i
can
find
no
basis
for
that
at
all.
they
assigned
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
and
this
point
was
not
urged
on
his
master
--
the
master.
this
point
is
not
made
until
the
argument
in
new
york
that
this
in
effect
amounted
to
a
permission
to
arizona
and
california
to
went
above
the
lake
and
take
the
water
and
accordingly,
frankly,
we
haven't
thought
of
this
argument
and
honestly
i
think.
but
on
reflection
upon
further
thought
and
upon
further
reading
of
the
congressional
history,
it
just
doesn't
make
sense
to
suggest
to
having
set
aside
this
water
for
the
purpose
of
this
project
having
considered
and
measured
at
lee
ferry
having
consider
the
supply
at
lee
ferry.
having
told
the
secretary
he
is
to
figure
out
how
much
water
this
will
supply
in
the
way
of
water
to
sell,
water
to
generate
power.
and
based
on
that,
he
is
to
build
the
project
and
then
to
say
that
despite
that,
arizona
or
california
can
commit
and
take
half
that
water
without
his
consent
or
the
consent
of
the
united
states.
that
is
why,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
quoted
with
care
from
the
appellates
of
the
case
to
the
effect
that
it
involved
not
only
the
commerce
clause
involve
not
only
the
matter
of
navigation
but
the
peripheral
and
other
factors
which
went
to
make
that
exercise
of
that
part
feasible
or
economic.
now
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
if
i
might
to
travel
for
just
a
moment
to
legislative
history
by
way
of
the
evolution
of
sections
4
(a)
and
5.
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
and
only
for
that
purpose,
we
had
printed
a
little
piece
of
paper
here
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
supplied
to
you
in
evolution
of
sections
4
(a)
and
5,
first
paragraph
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
for
our
use
in
oral
argument,
this
amounts
to
no
more
if
it
please
the
court
than
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
it
was.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct.
it
is.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
realize
the
court
is
getting
a
few
papers
it
might
even
be
felt
distractive.
the
only
purpose
of
this
if
it
please
the
court
is
conclusion.
there's
no
editorial
commentaries,
there's
no
argument,
it
is
simply
excerpts
from
amendments
as
proposed.
first
--
in
the
first
section,
though
i
shouldn't
say
that,
it
goes
back
to
the
third
swing-johnson
bill.
the
first
printed
section
is
section
5
of
s
33,
31
which
was
in
the
69th
congress,
the
first
session.
mr.
mark
wilmer
1926,
your
honor
i
believe.
i
--
i
think
that's
right
but
i
--
the
only
purpose
of
this
first
quote,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
to
show
how
the
evolution
of
section
5
began.
you
will
note
that
it
has
a
provision
contracts
respecting
water
for
domestic
use
--
for
domestic
use
maybe
for
a
permanent
service
but
subject
to
rights
of
prior
appropriators.
i
would
therefore
call
your
honors'
attention
that
at
this
stage
of
the
evolution
of
section
5
which
is
the
provision
of
project
act
which
we
say
interlocking
with
section
4
(a)
constitutes
an
allegation.
this
provision
specifically
say
the
rights
of
prior
appropriators
and
that
if
it
please
mr.
justice
black
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
our
belief
that
present
perfected
rights
in
pursuance
of
article
viii
means
less
than
it
might
mean
at
first
blush
because
here
we
have
an
express
provision
in
the
act
as
introduced
which
protected
and
preserved
rights
of
prior
appropriators.
now
in
the
69th
congress,
the
senate
committee
on
irrigation
and
reclamation
reported
out
section
5
of
the
senate
bill.
the
eliminations
are
bracketed,
the
additions
are
italicized
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
in
quickly
recognizing
the
difference.
the
significant
portion
of
course
is
at
the
top
of
page
2,
“no
person
shall
have
or
be
entitled
to
have
the
use
for
any
purpose
of
water
stored
as
aforesaid
except
by
contract
as
herein
stated”.
the
committee
of
which
i
believe
at
that
time
senator
hyrum
johnson
was
the
chairman
deleted
the
provision,
”may
be
for
permanent
service”,
and
changed
it
to,
“shall
be
for
permanent
service”.
and
deleted,
“but
subject
to
the
rights
of
prior
appropriators.”
and
added,
“no
person
shall
have
or
be
entitled
to
have
the
use,
for
any
purpose,
of
the
water
stored
as
aforesaid
except
by
contract
made
as
herein
stated”.
we
believe
that
is
persuasive,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
at
least
the
senate
committee
which
acted
upon
this
ruled
out
subjugating
this
water
of
the
rights
of
prior
appropriators
and
rule
in
the
proposition
that
no
person
should
have
this
water
for
any
purpose
except
by
contract
with
the
secretary.
now,
the
next
little
excerpt
is
just
by
way
of
a
(inaudible)
to
our
esteemed
to
senator
ashurst
but
in
fact
the
first
mention
of
a
limitation
on
california
working
out
this
problem
between
arizona
and
california,
appeared
in
a
bill
which
he
--
which
i
believe
he
had
printed
but
did
not
offer
in
which
he
suggested
a
limitation
on
california.
up
to
this
time
the
swing-johnson
acts
had
not
propose
any
limitation
on
anybody
in
the
lower
basin.
and
up
to
this
point,
they
have
gotten
exactly
no
one.
now
in
the
70th
congress
which
was
1928,
section
5
as
introduced
is
most
illuminating.
not
as
introduced,
i'm
sorry.
it
was
introduced
as
it
ended
up
in
the
third
swing-johnson,
was
introduced
in
the
form
which
you
have
seen
on
the
bottom
of
the
preceding
papers,
as
amended.
i
saved
a
little
printing
by
simply
saying
that
section
5
of
senate
728,
which
was
the
senate
bill
in
the
fourth
swing-johnson
introduced
in
the
70th
congress
in
the
form
shown
above
as
reported
out
of
the
committee
on
irrigation
and
reclamation
provided
the
following.
again,
i'll
bring
your
attention
that
this
committee,
i
believe
it
was
chairman
by
senator
hyrum
johnson.
the
addition
is
of
two
things,
one,
minor
related
to
generation
of
electrical
energy.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
i'm
wrong
your
honor,
it
wasn't.
i
was
thinking
of
it
was
minor
in
the
later
i
mean
this
is
major
the
later
point
in
the
fight.
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
you
have
corrected
it.
but
--
excuse
me
--
the
italicized
language
is
most
significant.
it
has
been
california's
assertion
time
and
time
again
that
this
project
act
did
not
deal
with
mainstream
water.
well
here
is
the
committee
amendment
in
the
first
session
of
the
70th
congress
adding
this,
“provided
however
that
said
contracts”,
these
are
the
secretary's
contracts,
no
one
can
have
any
water
without
them,
“shall
not
provide
for
an
aggregate
annual
consumptive
use
in
california
of
more
than
4,600,000
acre-feet
of
water
allocated
to
the
lower
basin
by
the
colorado
river
compact
mentioned
in
section
12
and
one-half
of
the
unallocated
excess,
and
or
surplus
water,
provided
further,
that
no
such
contract
shall
be
made
until
california,
by
act
of
its
legislature,
shall
have
ratified
and
approved
the
foregoing
provision
for
use
of
water
in
said
state
and
then
no
person
shall
have
or
be
entitled
to
have
the
use
for
any
purpose
of
the
water
stored
as
apportioned
except
by
contract
made
as
herein
stated”.
in
other
words,
the
first
limitation
on
california,
the
first
movement
toward
the
final
passage
of
this
act
came
in
section
5
and
by
a
virtue
of
a
restriction
on
the
right
of
the
secretary
to
contract
with
respect
to
water.
now
if
we
are
right
that
this
water
that
was
being
stored
was
mainstream
water
and
it's
pretty
difficult
to
come
to
any
other
conclusion.
we
then
find
that
the
first
mention
of
a
restriction
on
california,
the
first
attempt
to
divide
this
water
is
how?by
limiting
the
right
of
the
secretary
to
contract
with
respect
to
how
much
that
water
they
could
give
in
california.
i
would
like
also
if
you
would
please
note
above
five
lines
in
the
bottom
of
that,
the
words
appeared
that
no
such
contract
shall
be
made
until
california
to
the
end
with
the
italicized
portion.
before
going
to
the
next
amendment
which
was
printed,
i'd
like
to
suggest
this
to
the
court
that
this
was
a
period
of
foremen.
this
was
a
period
when
subsequent
to
the
governor's
conference
unquestionably
backroom
conferences
and
front
room
conferences
in
california
conference
and
all
kinds
of
conferences
were
going
on.
we
find
gradually
evolving
the
notion
of
how
to
protect
the
upper
basin
if
arizona
didn't
ratify
how
to
reduce
arizona
to
ratify
and
that
is
the
purpose
of
our
printing
of
the
next
several
amendments.
but
i
want
to
call
one
other
thing
to
your
honors'
attention.
senator
johnson,
chairman
of
the
committee
--
chairman
of
the
committee
which
reported
out
this
measure
made
this
observation
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
it
appears
in
69th
congressional
record
at
7250.
section
5
provides,
“that
the
contract
must
be
generally
for
storage
and
delivery
of
water
and
the
secretary
shall
fix
charges
to
meet
the
revenue
requirements
and
that
contracts
for
irrigation
and
domestic
uses
must
be
for
permanent
service”.
an
amendment
has
been
inserted
here
to
request
to
the
upper
basin
states
offered
i
think
in
the
committee
by
the
senator
from
wyoming
which
provides
that
and
then
he
quotes
the
italicized
provision
you
have
just
read.
then
he
said,
“that
is
another
rigorous
provision.
a
rigorous
provision
to
which
those
who
represent
california
are
willing
to
consent
in
order
that
legislation
might
be
accorded
but
binding
california
perpetually
and
forever
to
use
not
to
exceed
4,600,000
acre-feet
of
water”,
binding
california
how?
a
reasonable
limitation
upon
the
power
of
the
secretary
to
contract
with
respect
to
stored
mainstream
water
and
yet
to
have
told
time
and
again,
california
didn't
understand
what
she
was
getting
into.
california
built
these
great
projects
upon
the
assumption
that
she
was
safe
and
doing
so
at
least
for
the
system
allocation.
now,
i
ask
your
honors
to
note
the
portion
of
the
italicized
section
5
as
it
came
out
the
committee.
senator
waterman,
one
of
the
senators
from
the
upper
basin,
i
have
forgotten,
colorado
i
believe
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
printed
an
amendment
with
respect
to
section
5
which
struck
out
the
words
i
have
asked
you
to
note
that
no
such
contract
shall
be
made
until
california
and
so
on
and
propose
to
insert
therein
the
language
which
is
set
forth.
the
only
significant
thing
i'm
going
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
is
the
fact
that
he
specifically
stated,
“shall
have
first
ratified
and
approved
all
of
the
provisions
of
this
section
and
set
in
this
act
in
anyway
relating
to
the
use
of
waters
of
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river
within
or
by
the
state
of
california
or
by
any
virtue
of
cooperation
for
said
state”.
and
then
on
the
next
page,
“that
any
and
all
water
demanded
and
required
are
lawfully
appropriated
and
applied
for
beneficial
use
for
the
state
of
arizona
or
any
of
its
inhabitants
including
corporations,
municipal
or
otherwise,
or
any
of
them
out
of
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river
shall
at
anytime
exceed
and
so
on”.
in
other
words,
senator
waterman
clarified
and
definitely
identified
what
they
were
talking
about
was
mainstream
water.
it
was
water
which
was
in
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river
which
that
i
have
said
before
you
your
honors,
was
the
only
concern
of
these
people,
these
upper
basin
states
were
not
concern
in
the
slightest
with
the
uses
of
our
tributaries.
they
were
concerned
with
the
notion
of
the
tentacles
of
the
lower
basin
reaching
up
into
the
upper
basin
by
means
of
an
equitable
apportionment
suit
and
demanding
more
water.
that's
what
they
were
afraid
of
and
that
was
what
they
were
protecting
themselves
against
and
the
one
thing
they
were
concerned
with
was
mainstream
water
because
lower
basin
tributaries
weren't
accessible
to
them,
rights
are
and
couldn't
be
asserted
against
them
because
they
were
not
of
the
supply.
just
doesn't
add
up
to
assert
that
the
upper
basin
was
concerned
for
one
second
with
uses
in
the
lower
basin
or
concerned
that
it
should
be
a
system
matter
insofar
as
a
project
act
was
concerned.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
there's
just
isn't
any
other
answer
to
it.
otherwise,
we
have
to
consider
that
the
states
of
the
upper
basin,
the
senators
of
the
upper
basin
were
concerned
with
limiting
the
economic
development
of
the
lower
basin
which
have
no
relationship
to
it.
what
did
they
care
of?
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
unequivocally,
no.
that
is
the
purport
of
section
18,
that
is
the
reason
for
section
18
which
i
quoted
earlier
which
said,
“that
nothing
herein
contained
in
the
project
act
shall
be
construed”,
i'm
not
trying
to
repeat
this
from
memory,
i'm
simply
giving
the
substance
of
it,
“shall
be
construed
as
interfering
with
the
right
of
any
state
to
control
the
waters
within
its
borders
except
insofar
as
modified
by
the
colorado
river
compact”.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
under
the
compact,
the
upper
basin
assumed
that
they
obligation
in
3
(c)
--
in
3
(d),
assume
the
obligation
knowingly,
willingly,
purposely
that
they
would
deliver
on
an
average
7,500,000
every
year
at
lee
ferry.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
a
calculated
risk
they
took
to
get
the
consent
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
meant
to
say
this
that
nothing
that
your
honors
do
today
or
i
shouldn't
say
today
i
mean
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
nothing
your
honors
can
do
in
the
decision
of
--
should
do
in
the
decision
of
this
case
assuming
that
it
is
a
statutory
construction
case
with
respect
to
the
meeting
of
what
with
respect
to
what
congress
meant
in
enacting
the
project
act
can
effect
the
upper
basin.
nothing
--
nothing
can
affect
the
upper
basin.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor
is
now
speaking
of
a
system
lower
basin
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
best
way
i
can
answer
that
is
this
your
honor.
this
court
should
not
enlarge
the
obligation
of
the
upper
basin
under
the
colorado
river
compact.
this
court
does
not
need
to
enlarge
the
obligation
of
the
upper
basin
under
the
colorado
river
compact.
mr.
mark
wilmer
unless
they
were
here
and
i
see
no
occasion
for
having
them
here
or
offer
than
being
here.
as
i
said
before
your
honor
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i
am
sure
that
perhaps
mr.
ely
did
not
mean
to
make
the
statement
he
did
when
he
said
that
the
75,
excuse
me,
that
he
said
that
the
75,000,000
of
3
(d)
water
included
mexico.
i'm
sure
he
did
not
mean
to
make
that
statement
because
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
think
there
could
be
no
question
of
what
the
treaty
must
be
carried
out.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
we'd
have
no
right
to
ask
that
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
obviously,
there's
no
question
your
honor
unless
they
can
hear
one
qualification.
unless
under
the
compact
as
agreed
to,
that
result
followed
and
i
mean
by
that
merely
their
obligation
under
3
(d).
in
other
words,
this
court,
i
do
not
think
would
attempt
to
either
interpret
or
modify
the
compact
and
the
compact
fairly
requires
that
the
upper
basin
must
and
they
were
on
an
average
75,000,000
over
a
10-year
period.
so
that
i
would
qualify
my
answer
only
in
the
summary,
that
nothing
which
we
have
urged
on
the
court,
nothing
which
we
would
suggest
in
the
decree
this
court
enter
could
in
any
fashion
enlarge
or
lessen
the
obligation
of
the
upper
basin.
my
answer
to
your
honor
is
quick
but
fair.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
provision
i
might
simply
note
in
passing
of
3
(c)
which
is
a
mexican
treaty
application
is
that
if
such
surplus
which
is
a
surplus
above
(a)
and
(b)
shall
prove
insufficient
for
this
purpose,
then
the
burden
of
such
deficiency
shall
be
equally
borne
by
the
upper
and
lower
basin
and
whenever
necessary,
the
states
of
the
upper
division
shall
deliver
at
lee
ferry
water
to
supply
a
one-half
of
the
deficiency
so
recognized
in
addition
--
in
addition
to
that
provided
in
paragraph
(d).
now
paragraph
(d)
is
a
paragraph
which
provide
for
75,000,000
on
a
10-year
average.
and
therefore,
the
mexican
water
is
not
included
within
the
75,000,000
because
it
shall
be
in
addition
to
that
required
by
paragraph
(d).
now,
the
following
is
an
amendment
printed,
get
myself
cleared.
the
other
waterman
amendment
following
that
is
section
4
(a).
in
other
words,
we
have
now
progressed
with
the
section
5
amendment
through
the
first
section
of
the
70th
congress
which
has
resulted
in
an
amendment
restricting
california
by
a
limitation
upon
the
secretary's
power
to
contract
that
ends
our
treatment
of
4
(d)
and
4
(a)
section
5
at
this
moment.
we
have
started
now
in
the
first
session
of
the
70th
congress
with
the
section
5
out
of
committee
with
a
limitation
upon
the
secretary's
right
to
contract
limited
to
4,600,000.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
our
belief,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no.
no
it's
--
it's
the
water
in
lake
mead
and
because
the
only
place
he
could
contract
under
the
project
act
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
(inaudible)
it
confines
california's
rights
to
water
below
lee
ferry
and
in
lake
mead.
i
would
say
the
secretary's
rights
to
contract
are
with
respect
to
water
which
he
is
to
store
under
the
project
act
because
that's
safe.
mr.
mark
wilmer
lee
ferry
and
in
lake
mead,
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
the
water
in
--
below
lee
ferry
your
honor
has
got
to
go
to
lake
mead,
that
we
think
it's
committed
to
lake
mead,
we
think
it
is
tied
to
lake
mead,
that
it's
dedicated
to
lake
mead
and
we
think
that
it
is,
in
effect,
in
lake
mead
because
hydrologically
it
must
go
there.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
am
told
that
i
may
have
misspoken
this
morning
in
stating
the
figures
which
senator
johnson
placed
in
the
record
as
being
the
--
then
uses
of
california
until
i
said
a
million,
two
hundred
and
some
thousands,
two
million
a
hundred
and
fifty-nine
thousand,
i
believe.
the
amount
which
he
claimed
was
six
million
and
nine
thousand,
i
think
i
stated
that
big,
his
claim
but
the
uses
which
he
specified
were
in
the
neighborhood
of
two
million
one
or
two
hundred
thousand
rather
than
if
i
did
say
so,
one
million
your
honor.
secondly
before
going
on,
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
arizona
concurs
in
the
master's
conclusion
that
inflow
below
lee
ferry
and
in
to
the
reservoir
is
part
of
the
water
which
is
the
subject
of
the
congressional
consideration
and
distribution.
i
may
have
spoken
improvidently,
a
time
of
upper
basin
water,
it
is
the
master's
view
and
it
is
our
view
that
congress
dealt
with
the
supply
of
water
at
lee
ferry
mainstream
which
of
course
is
upper
basin
water.
and
in
addition,
recognized
there
would
be
inflow
below
lee
ferry
and
above
hoover
or
boulder
dam.
arizona
does
not
contend
for
a
moment
that
this
water
when
and
as
it
reaches
the
mainstream
is
not
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
act,
it
is.
make
no
contention
to
that
effect
at
all.
your
honor,
there
is
one
as
known
as
the
little
colorado,
actually
the
most
water
which
reaches
the
stream
from
that
is
and
what
is
known
as
blue
springs
which
are
down
at
the
bottom
of
a
rather
deep
canyon
and
close
to
the
river.
on
occasion,
the
little
colorado
runs
in
the
spring
and
flood.
it
--
it
drains
an
area
of
northern
arizona
much
like
the
upper
basin
that
is,
it's
a
high
country
in
snow
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
mark
wilmer
pardon?
yes,
there
are
old
consumptive
uses
your
honor,
going
back
to
the
'70s
perhaps,
it
was
the
--
some
of
our
--
for
a
moment,
the
early
seven
--
the
northern
part
of
the
state
in
that
area
but
not
large
and
the
inflow
is
sporadic
and
is
not
large,
there
is
an
addition
from
utah
and
nevada,
the
virgin
river,
the
muddy
river.
there
are
miscellaneous
springs
and
inflows
but,
actually
as
i
remember
the
figures
they
gained
from
lee
ferry
to
the
dam
generally
is
recognized
as
in
the
magnitude
of
a
million
acre-feet,
maybe
a
little
higher.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
were
--
we
--
we
cons
--
we
concur
your
honor
and
this
concludes
that
after
water
is
freed
from
the
tributaries
and
reaches
the
main
stream,
it
falls
squarely
within
the
secretary's
power
to
contract.
mr.
mark
wilmer
our
view
is
this
your
honor,
that
uses
on
the
tributary
below
lee
ferry
and
above
the
dam
within
the
state
are
not
chargeable
against
the
california
limitation.
in
other
words,
we
believe
that
section
8
again
protects
us,
in
that
--
it
says
that
water
within
the
state
except
as
it
is
modified
by
the
colorado
river
compact
is
not
to
be
disturbed
by
the
project
act.
we
say
and
we
agree
with
the
master
in
his
conclusion
that
when
the
secretary
said
that
you
have
to
accept
uses
on
your
tributaries
which
might
never
reach
or
which
--
i'm
--
would
be
making
an
accurate
statement.
the
statement
was
that
uses
on
the
tributaries
to
the
extent
they
diminished
the
flow
into
the
reservoir
are
chargeable
against
our
two
million
eight.
we
disagree
with
this
requirement
that
we
accept
uses
to
the
extent
they
deplete
the
flow.
we
do
concur
that
to
the
extent
that
flow
reaches
the
river
and
becomes
a
part
of
the
stream,
it
then
becomes
subject
to
the
project
act.
i
cannot
add
it,
if
it
please
the
court
to
the
master's
treatment
of
our
objection.
mr.
mark
wilmer
if
it
gets
into
the
mainstream,
its
part
of
the
mainstream.
congress
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no
--
no,
i
didn't
mean
that
if
i
said
so,
i
misspoke
your
honor.
i
meant
this.
we
do
not
concur
--
we
do
not
contend
that
we
have
any
right
to
a
credit
so
to
speak
for
inflow
below
lee
ferry
and
above
the
dam
for
our
contribution
after
it
reaches
the
stream.
we
concur
in
the
secretary's
--
in
the
master's
finding
that
congress
did
recognize
there
was
a
miscellaneous
inflow,
did
not
look
to
it
for
the
supply
but
it
recognized
it
was
there
and
we
would
be
--
we
would
be
very
unrealistic
to
contend.
mr.
mark
wilmer
our
view
your
honor
is
that
exactly
that
the
congress
said
you
can
construct
a
reservoir
on
the
dam,
that's
all
congress
told
him
he
could
do.
that's
all
he
should've
done.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
until
it
got
in
lake
mead.
i
would
--
yes.
i
--
i
should
answer
your
honor
directly.
he
would
not
have
any
power
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
to
contract
with
arizona
to
take
water
out
of
the
river
above
lake
mead.
i
--
i
certainly
--
sorry
if
i
misspoke
myself
in
that
respect
your
honor,
that
unquestionably
is
our
position
and
unequivocally,
i
think
it's
correct.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
he
has
not
your
honor,
the
--
the
contract
provision
of
arizona
which
we
objected
to
and
we
contested
before
the
master
in
which
he
accepted
as
a
proper
objection,
it's
a
provision
of
7
(l)
of
our
contract
which
says
that
to
the
extent,
our
uses
on
the
tributaries
above
lake
mead
and
below
lee
ferry
diminish,
deplete,
the
flow
in
the
lake
--
into
the
river
and
into
the
dam
to
that
extent,
we're
charged
against
our
two
million
acre.
we
contest
that
that
on
the
ground
it
was
beyond
the
secretary's
power
and
the
master
has
accepted
that
and
had
said
it
was
beyond
the
secretary's
power
and
has
recommended
that
that
provision
be
held
improper.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
do,
your
honor.
i
understand
in
california's
position
is
that
in
some
strange
fashion
the
master
has
separated
out
of
the
context
this
whole
thing
that
stretch
between
lee
ferry
and
the
head
of
the
reservoir
and
in
some
fashion,
removed
that
from
consideration,
we
don't
think
that's
true
at
all.
we
think
the
secretary's
power
if
i
can
again
say
this,
the
secretary's
power
has
distinguished
from
the
dedication
of
that
water
by
the
congress
is
limited
to
the
water
that
the
congress
told
that
he
could
store
and
use.
that's
--
that's
a
distinction.
now,
if
i
might
turn
back
again
to
the
progress
of
the
evolution
of
section
4
(a),
the
significant
thing
which
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
in
respect
to
this
next
several
amendments
which
were
printed
but
not
offered
in
the
first
session
of
the
70th
congress.
first
of,
on
page
8
of
this
little
pamphlet
that
we
have
provided
is
an
amendment
printed
but
not
offered
by
senator
phipps.
this
amendment
later
became
the
first
paragraph
of
section
4
(a),
the
first
paragraph
of
the
limitation
on
california
and
the
requirement
for
seven
states
or
six
states
ratification.
now,
may
i
again
call
this
sequence
of
events
to
the
court's
attention?
the
water
amendment
which
i
have
referred
to
as
to
section
5
but
it
again
was
working
upon,
if
i
may
use
that
word,
deferment
was
working
of
some
method
of
controlling
the
uses
in
the
mainstream.
section
4
(a)
as
printed
by
senator
phipps
in
the
first
session
did
this
very
significant
thing.
it
eliminated
it
from
section
5,
if
you
would
turn
back
if
you
please,
to
section
5,
to
the
portion
i
emphasized
on
page
3
that
is
italicized.
senator
phipps'
amendment
deleted
from
section
5
this
limitation
language
which
restricted
the
secretary's
power
to
contract
as
a
limitation.
in
section
--
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
you
look
at
section
3.
mr.
mark
wilmer
in
section
5,
if
it
please
the
court,
we
will
let
that
at
the
end
of
the
first
session
with
a
limitation
on
the
secretary's
power
to
contract
in
section
5,
which
restricted
his
power
to
four
million
six.
senator
phipps
offered
this
amendment,
which
eliminated
it
from
section
5,
this
limitation
on
the
secretary
but
transferred
it
to
section
4.
the
language
of
the
phipps
amendment
as
introduced
on
page
8
provided
for
the
ratification
and
provided
and
inserted
for
the
first
time
the
requirement
that
the
limitation
on
--
use
should
be
stricken
from
section
5
and
should
be
incorporated
in
section
4,
page
8
and
9,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
it
provides
first
for
the
alternate
of
the
little
book,
your
honor.
the
top
of
page
9,
it
provides,
"and
until
the
state
of
california
by
act
of
its
legislature
shall
agree
with
the
united
states
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
states
of
arizona,
colorado
and
nevada,
new
mexico,
utah
and
wyoming
as
an
expressed
covenant.
and
in
consideration
the
passage
of
this
act,
that
the
aggregate
--
angled
diversions
of
water
coming
from
the
colorado
river
for
use
in
the
state
of
california,
including
all
diversions
under
contracts
made
under
the
provision
of
this
act
and
so
on,
shall
not
exceed
four
million
six
hundred
thousand
acre-feet
of
the
water
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
states
for
the
colorado
river
compact
or
one
half
of
the
surplus."
now
this
point
--
in
this
amendment
senator
phipps
proposed
the
excision
from
section
5
of
the
contractual
limitation
on
the
secretary
as
imposing
a
limitation
on
california
and
inserted
it
in
section
4
(a).
the
last
portion
on
page
7
strike
out
the
land's
four
to
12
inclusive
and
insert
a
neuter
on
the
following
that
you
will
find
is
an
excision
from
section
5
of
the
italicized
portion
which
is
found
in
the
page
3,
termination
of
that
in
the
69th
congress.
senator
bratton
offered
an
amendment
along
the
same
general
lines
and
senator
pittman
offered
an
amendment
which
later
became
the
hayden
amendment
that
is
found
on
page
9.
the
pittman
amendment
envisage
not
only
a
transfer
of
the
limitation
to
section
4
(a)
but
a
mandatory
compact,
and
over
to
this
point,
we
have
in
section
4
(a)
(1)
a
limitation
by
--
i
mean
a
ratification
by
seven
states,
the
ratification
by
six
states,
a
limitation
in
california
and
a
mandatory
compact.
in
other
words,
congress
in
this
language
said
california
must
agree.
if
arizona
and
nevada
accept
the
limitation
which
is
proposed
in
paragraph
1,
california
then
must
compact
along
the
lines
of
the
division
which
we
have
previously
indicated.
in
that
connection,
in
discussing
the
matter,
senator
pittman
made
this
observation
that
is
why
he
said
that
he
was
at
the
governors'
conference.
i
wish
to
play
--
this
is
from
our
legislative
history
at
page
24,
i
wish
to
place
in
the
record
at
this
point
a
suggested
amendment.
it
is
not
to
be
proposed
because
it
will
be
perfectly
useless
but
it
had
been
suggested.
it
is
in
accordance
for
the
conference
to
which
i
have
just
referred,
governors'
conference.
that
it's
designed
to
carry
out
that
idea
at
some
date.
now,
senator
pittman
in
substance
said,
this
has
been
proposed
to
carry
out
what
was
arrived
at
at
the
governors'
conference.
someone
offer
it
now
because
it
isn't
time
but
at
some
date,
this
is
what
we're
going
to
do.
it
was
largely
drawn
by
mr.
wilson.
that's
mr.
francis
wilson,
who
was
a
well-known
and
respected
attorney
from
new
mexico
and
a
very
highly
regarded
water
attorney.
the
law
only
drawn
by
mr.
wilson
the
commissioner
of
new
mexico
in
the
course
the
conference
to
which
i
have
just
referred,
it
is
only
to
be
published
in
the
record.
it's
not
offered
as
an
amendment.
now
that,
if
it
please
the
court,
about
concludes
the
first
section
of
the
70th
congress.
we
find
pending
the
bratton
amendment,
the
phipps
amendment,
the
pittman
amendment,
all
having
the
same
central
theme,
a
limitation
in
california,
the
pittman
amendment
and
mandatory
compact
in
california
and
the
removal
of
the
limitation
on
the
secretary's
power
to
contract
from
section
5
as
a
limitation
in
california
to
section
4.
now,
it
is
most
significant
--
most
significant,
that
the
excision
of
five
at
the
same
time
was
in
connection
or
was
at
the
same
time
a
part
of
a
connection
with
the
amendment
to
four,
which
put
the
limitation
in
section
4.
in
other
words,
i
can
draw
no
conclusion
reasonably
i
think.
but
what
the
phipps
amendment
said,
"no
we
won't
put
this
in
section
5.
we
won't
limit
the
secretary's
power
to
contract
in
this
fashion,
we'll
make
it
part
of
section
4
(a)
and
say
that
until
california
has
by
statute,
limited
herself,
nothing
so
happen."
in
other
words,
i
think
it
is
logical
and
reasonable
inference
that
the
4
(a)
limitation
language
being
excised
was
transferred
to
and
put
into
section
4
(a).
that
becomes
important
in
connection
with
our
so-called
mandatory
allocation
argument.
now
at
the
opening
of
the
--
incidentally
the
first
section
is
probably
you
all
know
entered
in
a
filibuster
which
repeated
the
--
the
passage
of
the
act
to
that
session
although
the
house
had
passed
and
sent
to
the
senate
a
companion
measure
introduced
by
representative
swing.
now,
at
the
opening
of
the
second
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
forces
behind
it
were
the
--
our
good
senator
hayden
and
our
good
senator
ashurst.
mr.
mark
wilmer
because
the
allegation
which
we
were
seeking
had
not
been
arrived
at.
in
other
words,
these
are
--
these
amendments
your
honor
had
been
offered
but
--
have
been
printed
but
not
offered.
there
was
still
--
there
was
still
not
enough
meeting
of
the
minds
to
arrive
at
what
at
least
arizona
considered
to
be
an
inducement
to
ratify
the
compact
what
the
upper
basin's
considered
had
gone
--
progressed
far
enough
to
protect
it.
mr.
mark
wilmer
pardon?
mr.
mark
wilmer
to
these
amendments?
no,
senator
hayden
offered
the
pittman
amendment
at
the
opening
of
the
second
session
your
honor.
i
would
say
contrary
to
execute
--
to
indicating
hostility,
the
only
hostility
that
senator
hayden
who
carried
them
all
for
arizona,
really,
indicated
was
the
four
million
six
versus
the
other
allocation
and
to
the
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
bargaining
was
in
process
your
honor.
i
think
that's
a
fair
analogy
and
a
fair
statement.
but
it
is
significant,
to
please
the
court,
that
at
the
opening
of
the
second
session
of
the
70th
congress,
the
senator
from
california,
senator
johnson
asked
unanimous
consent
to
take
the
house
measure
which
had
been
passed,
check
up
the
title
and
insert
underneath
it
the
senate
measure,
the
senate
bill
728.
in
other
words,
at
the
outset
of
the
70th
congress,
the
senate
discarded
the
passed
statute
as
sent
forward
from
the
house
in
the
previous
session
and
simply
gave
it
the
house
number
and
did
that
by
unanimous
consent.
now,
in
line
with
justice
frankfurter's
observation
that
the
bargaining
hadn't
ended,
i
would
conclude
that
the
bargaining
had
made
some
satisfactory
progress
or
this
legislative
maneuver
would
never
have
been
achieved
with
unanimous
consent.
i
would
have
assumed
that
senator
hayden
and
senator
ashurst
at
least
could
have
arose
and
said,
"no,
we
won't
agree
to
that."
now,
the
next
amendment
which
is
in
order,
is
on
page
11
which
is
the
hayden
amendment
to
the
--
to
the
then
pending
bill.
i
would
bring
to
your
honors'
attention
this
fact
because
of
the
fact
that
senator
johnson
asked
and
received
unanimous
consent
to
amend
the
house
measure
by
eliminating
the
entire
body
of
the
act
and
inserting
in
lieu
thereof
the
body
of
the
act
of
728,
that
then
became
an
amendment,
a
pending
amendment
and
that
becomes
important
as
we
will
see
as
we
go
on.
so
that
actually
the
matter
pending
before
the
house
was
the
johnson
amendment
to
the
house
measure
which
had
come
forward
and
had
been
passed.
the
hayden
amendment
was
the
pittman
amendment
word
per
word.
it
proposed
the
mandatory
compact.
it
proposed
the
four
million
two
to
california,
three
million
to
arizona
and
the
same
division
in
the
mandatory
compact.
now,
the
thing
that
i
now
would
stress,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
that
the
phipps
amendment
had
been
printed
in
the
first
session.
the
phipps
amendment
as
i
may
go
back
just
briefly,
one
transferred
from
section
5
to
section
4,
the
limitation
on
the
right
of
california
to
get
water.
that
became
a
part
of
section
4
and
it
provided
for
a
six-to-eight
ratification.
but
the
significant
thing
is
that
the
phipps
amendment
called
for
(inaudible)
--
for
a
excision
of
this
limitation
and
its
transfer
to
4.
the
next
significant
thing
if
i
may
say
is
this,
senator
phipps
had
offered
--
had
printed
this
amendment
in
the
first
session
but
had
not
offered
it.
he
did
not
offer
it
in
the
second
session
until
senator
hayden
had
offered
his
amendment.
now
mind
you,
his
amendment
had
been
printed
within
the
record.
hayden's
amendment
had
not
been
printed
and
was
in
the
record.
and
yet
senator
phipps
for
some
reason
waited
until
the
hayden
amendment
had
been
tendered
and
offered.
and
then
he
said
this,
offering
his
amendment.
mr.
phipps
--
i'm
reading
from
page
15
of
our
legislative
history.
so
i'm
reading
from
page
15
of
--
we
printed
this
little
excerpt
on
page
15
of
this
matter.
mr.
phipps,
i
understand
that
the
pending
amendment
is
the
one
offered
by
the
junior
senator
from
arizona,
mr.
hayden.
i
desire
to
offer
an
amendment
to
that
amendment
which
i
believe
is
permissible
under
the
rule
enforced.
in
other
words,
not
only
did
senator
phipps
wait
until
the
hayden
amendment
had
been
offered
but
before
offering
his
amendment,
he
carefully
inquired
and
was
assured
that
it
was
a
hayden
amendment
to
which
his
amendment
was
being
offered.
now,
may
i
suggest
the
significance
of
that?
the
hayden
amendment
then
contained
the
mandatory
formula.
the
hayden
amendment
then
provided
that
california
must
compact
along
the
lines
indicated.
now,
if
senator
phipps
have
not
been
keenly
aware
of
what
senator
hayden's
amendment
contained,
that
was
two
paragraphs
and
not
one,
he
wouldn't
have
been
so
careful
and
he
wouldn't
have
waited
but
he
first
found
out
it
was
a
hayden
amendment.
and
in
the
hayden
amendment,
there
was
a
mandatory
formula.
senator
phipps
in
his
amendment
struck
out
the
language.
i
mean,
in
his
amendment
to
section
5,
not
only
changed
over
the
limitation
on
the
secretary
but
added
the
language,
"and
shall
conform
to
the
provisions
of
section
4
(a)
and
shall
conform
to
the
provisions
of
section
4
(a)."
california
has
told
you
that
when
the
phipps
amendment
was
offered,
there
was
nothing
for
congress,
it
was
an
isolation.
that
is
not
the
fact.
the
legislative
history
clearly
indicates
that
when
senator
phipps
offered
his
amendment,
he
offered
it
by
striking
out
the
first
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
of
the
hayden
amendment
and
as
a
part
of
his
amendment
requiring
that
contracts
shall
conform
to
section
4
(a).
we
say
that
is
significant.
we
think
it
indicates
that
senator
phipps
that
the
bargaining
have
progressed
if
i
may
use
your
term
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
had
progressed
and
that
it
was
all
part
of
a
more
or
less
agreed
course
of
conduct.
now,
the
--
the
amendment
then
became
the
amendment
in
the
second
degree,
the
phipps
amendment,
the
hayden
amendment
and
the
johnson
amendment.
this
was
debated
for
some
time
and
then
this
parliamentary
maneuver
ensued.
the
senator
from
wis
--
from
arizona,
mr.
hayden
asked
in
page
17
of
our
little
excerpt
here,
"mr.
president,
i
would
like
to
have
the
attention
of
the
senator",
and
if
the
court
will
permit
me,
i
would
like
to
read
this
because
i
think
it's
important.
i
--
that
i
may
discuss
the
parliamentary
situation
as
it
exists
and
what
am
i
do
if
possible
to
remedy
it.
in
order
that
the
amendment
offered
by
the
senator
from
colorado,
mr.
phipps
maybe
perfected.
as
i
understand
the
situation,
the
amendment
offered
by
the
senator
from
colorado
is
an
amendment
in
the
second
degree,
an
amendment
to
the
amendment
which
i
have
offered
and
therefore
not
subject
to
amendment.
the
senator's
amendment
contains
three
substantive
propositions
upon
which
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
between
the
states
of
arizona
and
california
and
we
must
vote
upon
all
of
them
as
one
if
this
amendment
is
not
subject
to
amendment.
but
if
the
senator's
amendment
could
be
made
subject
to
amendment,
the
senate
could
vote
upon
the
various
propositions
separately,
for
example,
the
senators
taken
from
another
part
of
the
bill,
a
provision
that
refers
to
section
5.
a
provision
that
the
state
of
california
shall
have
four
million
six
hundred
thousand
acre-feet
of
water
on
the
colorado
river,
on
the
colorado
river.
now
there's
no
dispute
about
what
the
colorado
river
was,
it
wasn't
the
tributaries
and
it
wasn't
the
system.
arizona
agrees
that
the
state
of
california
shall
have
four
million
two
hundred
thousand
acre-feet
of
water.
now,
i
desire
at
the
range
so
that
the
senate
may
vote
upon
the
question
of
whether
it
shall
be
one
figure
or
the
other.
now,
if
anyone
can
tell
you
gentlemen
that
that
wasn't
a
square
cut
issue
before
the
senate
that
they
were
voted
--
vote
upon
how
much
water
california
should
have
and
how
it
should
be
divided?
i
wouldn't
know
how
to,
more
strongly
express
it
if
i
were
in
the
senate.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
the
cal
--
arizona
contended
then
for
four
million
two.
in
fact,
the
way
that
came
about
was
it
in
the
senate
in
the
senate
committee.
the
committee
reported
out
the
amendment
not
recomm
--
except
in
the
governors'
conference
recommendation
but
they're
all
of
four
million
six
and
four
million
two
and
arizona
had
accepted
that
as
an
--
as
a
compromise.
"i
would
like
to
inquire
of
the
president
of
the
senate
whether
i
should
withdraw
the
amendment
which
i
have
offered,
would
then
the
amendment
offered
by
the
senator
from
colorado
be
an
amendment
in
the
second
degree
and
subject
to
amendment?"
mr.
hayden,
"if
i
withdraw
the
amendment
which
i
have
offered
to
which
the
amendment
of
the
senator
from
colorado
is
a
substitute,
will
this
amendment
be
an
amendment
in
the
first
degree
and
subject
to
amendment?"
the
vice
president
told
him,
"no,
it
would
--
it
couldn't
be
done."
mr.
hayden
"would
it
then
be
possible
--
no,
they
said
he
could
withdraw
it.
"would
it
then
be
possible
for
the
senator
from
colorado
to
immediately
re-offer
his
amendment?"
the
senator
from
colorado
could
do
that.
now,
senator
hayden
said,
"i
wish
to
state
to
the
senate
that
what
i
am
trying
to
accomplish
is
to
get
a
vote
on
the
one
particular
question
of
the
quantity
of
water
which
the
state
of
colorado
may
divert
from
the
colorado
river,
should
it
be
two
million
four
hundred
thousand
acre-feet
or
four
million
six
hundred
thousand
acre-feet?"
i
can
state
in
15
or
20
minutes
all
the
reasons
why
arizona
favors
the
lesser
figure
and
then
the
senate
may
have
a
vote
upon
the
question.
mr.
phipps
(inaudible)
i
desire
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
four
million
six
hundred
thousand
acre-feet
was
a
figure
adopted
by
the
senate
committee.
it
was
written
in
the
substitute
then
offered
by
the
senator
in
california,
mr.
johnson.
therefore
it
seems
to
me
and
so
on,
whether
right
down
to
the
question
of
four
million
six
hundred
thousand
acre-feet
as
recommended
by
the
senate
committee
and
four
million
two
hundred
thousand
acre-feet
as
written
in
the
amendment
by
the
senator
from
arizona.
mr.
hayden,
"and
upon
that
particular
issue
and
upon
nothing
else,
i
desire
to
have
a
vote
of
the
senate
at
this
time."
mr.
phipps,
"the
other
item
that
is
in
the
amendment
to
which
the
senator
calls
attention
as
i
understand
it
is
the
provision
regarding
the
federal
power
commission,
that
is
the
only
matters
in
that."
my
amendment
has
originally
offered
--
provided
for
seven
state
ratification
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
the
senator
from
colorado
in
his
amendment
provides
for
a
six
state
ratification.
that
is
another
question
upon
which
i
--
we
should
like
to
have
the
senate
take
a
vote.
if
the
senate
will
bear
with
me
for
a
moment,
i
desire
to
say
that
it's
only
fair
to
the
state
of
arizona
that
the
several
substantive
propositions
which
are
contained
in
the
amendment
of
the
senator
from
colorado
and
in
my
amendment
be
voted
upon,
each
upon
its
own
merit
for
the
senate
and
not
grouped
together
in
one
particular
amendment.
if
i
am
privileged
to
do
so
mr.
president,
i
withdraw
without
prejudice
the
amendment
i
have
offered."
the
vice
president,
"the
senator
has
that
right."
the
amendment
of
the
senate
from
arizona
to
the
so-called
johnson
amendment
is
withdrawn.
senator
hayden,
"now,
if
the
senator
from
colorado,
mr.
phipps
will
again
offer
his
amendment,
just
as
it
is,
we
can
proceed
to
debate
it,
to
amend
it,
and
to
vote
upon
it."
mr.
phipps,
"mr.
president,
i
understand
the
senator
from
arizona
has
withdrawn
his
amendment.
i
desire
again
to
offer
my
amendment
as
it
now
is
before
the
senate."
mr.
vice
president,
"the
question
is
on
agreement
with
the
amendment
from
the
senator
from
colorado."
and
senator
hayden
then
offered
an
amendment
which
would
have
changed
it
to
four
million
two
and
which
was
lost.
thereafter,
senator
bratton,
who
has
been
described
by
california
as
not
believing
the
senate
could
describe
the
water
offer
the
bratton
amendment.
and
that
amendment
changed
the
figure
to
four
million
four
and
the
senate
enacted
that
amendment
and
it
became
four
million
four.
now,
i
do
not
want
to
bore
the
court
with
a
lot
of
excerpts
of
legislative
history.
i
feel,
however,
that
in
view
of
the
statements
made
by
california
that
at
least
a
modicum
might
be
in
order.
first
of
all,
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
which
reported
out
this
bill
with
four
million
six.
and
this
is
what
senator
hiram
johnson
said
in
proposing
that
bill
and
recommending
it
for
passage
in
the
senate
in
the
second
session
of
the
70th
congress.
"here,
finally
is
presented
a
unified
--
excuse
me.
mr.
mark
wilmer
it's
our
legislative
--
it's
on
--
not
in
this
your
honor.
it
is
--
the
citation
is
70th
congress
first
session,
senate
report
number
592.
mr.
mark
wilmer
is
it
on
our
legislative
history?
we'll
check
it,
your
honor,
if
so
--
well,
i'm
sure
it
is
but
i
wouldn't
--
probably
that
was
here.
here
is
what
he
said,
"we
will
provide
it
if
necessary
your
honor,
we
will
provide
it."
it's
the
second
session
your
honor,
it's
the
senate
report
number
592
of
the
70th
congress
first
session,
i'm
sorry,
first
session,
1928.
here
finally
is
presented
a
unified
plan
--
this
i
may
have
read
to
you
before
with
respect
to
5.
for
perfecting
those
entitled
for
protecting
those
entitled
to
protection
and
then
he
said,
"for
the
allocation
among
the
states
desiring
that
allocation
of
the
waters
of
a
great
river
to
which
all
are
entitled."
in
other
words,
here
is
senator
johnson
telling
them
that
in
this
bill,
which
is
reported
out,
they're
making
allocation
of
the
waters
of
this
great
river
to
those
who
shall
be
entitled
to
it.
now,
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
colloquy
from
--
between
senator
walsh
and
senator
johnson,
which
is
found
in
arizona
legislative
history
at
pages
40
to
43.
i
haven't
copied
the
whole
thing,
i
have
taken
excerpts
but
it
is
set
out
substantially
in
full.
mr.
mark
wilmer
mr.
walsh
of
montana,
"yes,
but
i
have
always
understood
that
the
interest
that
stores
a
water
has
a
superior
right
to
prior
appropriations
that
do
not
store."
mr.
johnson,
"possibly
so,
what
is
the
point?"
mr.
walsh,
"the
point
is
that
apparently
if
that
is
correct,
then
this
expenditure
is
being
made
with
no
right
in
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
control
the
water
which
is
stored
but
that
it
must
go
to
those
appropriators."
mr.
johnson,
"no.
the
bill
provides
that
a
contract
in
advance
must
be
made
for
the
storage
of
water
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior."
mr.
walsh,
"the
contract
with
whom?"
mr.
johnson,
"with
those
who
utilize
and
take
and
inappropriate
the
water."
mr.
walsh,
"that
is
to
say,
the
government
may
dispose
of
the
stored
water
as
it
sees
fit."
mr.
johnson,
"yes,
under
the
terms
of
the
bill."
he
goes
on.
mr.
walsh,
"i
directed
the
inquiry
merely
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
find
out
if
i
can,
under
what
kind
of
obligation
the
government
of
the
united
states
should
have
built
this
dam
would
be
to
those
who
have
the
appropriations."
mr.
johnson,
"the
government
would
be
under
no
obligations
until
it
makes
its
terms.
i
see
i'm
unable
to
make
that
plain.
but
here
is
something
in
this
--
but
here
is
some
--
everything
in
this
theme,
plan
or
design.
everything
is
dependant
upon
the
secretary
of
the
interior
contract
with
those
who
desire
the
benefit
of
the
construction
and
he
is
not
to
undertake
any
expenditure
or
to
undertake
any
construction
until
that
shall
have
been
accomplished."
mr.
walsh,
"let
us
suppose
the
arizona
people
are
perfect
and
willing
to
meet
the
requirements
and
that
the
los
angeles
people
are
perfect
and
willing
to
meet
the
requirements.
and
other
people
have
not
even
attempted
to
make
any
appropriation
are
perfectly
willing
to
meet
the
requirements.
who
has
the
right?"
mr.
johnson,
"the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
government
have
the
right."
mr.
walsh
of
montana,
"the
secretary
of
the
interior
may
possibly
ignore
those
appropriations?"
mr.
johnson,
"possibly
so."
mr.
mark
wilmer
he
said
possible.
mr.
johnson
has
been
accused
for
being
at
times
confused
by
california
when
some
of
his
legislative
history
has
been
a
little
embarrassing
that
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
precisely.
precisely,
your
honor
as
to
stored
water.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor,
let
me
make
this
distinction.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
understand
that.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
in
fact
i
think
that
troubles
my
brother,
mr.
reed
a
little
bit.
in
any
event,
our
position
is
this
your
honor,
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
the
government
claiming
water
in
the
sense
of
owning
it
in
a
flowing
stream.
this
is
a
question
of
the
government
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause
storing
a
large
body
of
water.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
distinction
is
this,
where
you
have
a
federal
project
which
stores
water
under
the
power
of
navigation
under
the
commerce
power
to
store
water
then
there
inheres
in
the
congress
the
right
to
say
how
that
water
shall
be
disposed
of.
in
fact,
there's
an
early
supreme
court
decision
which
involves
almost
the
same
general
type
of
situation
that's
--
its
back
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
--
your
honor
assume
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
if
this
were
a
non-navigable
stream,
your
honor
there'd
be
no
doubt
about
that.
the
distinction
arises
from
the
fact
this
is
a
navigable
stream
and
that
under
the
commerce
clause,
whether
there
is
appropriate
--
i
would
take
this
your
honor
appropriative
right
is
a
no
greater
consequence
than
the
right
in
the
appellation
case
of
the
power
company
which
had
a
permit
on
that
stream.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well
your
honor
in
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
in
--
in
united
states
versus
rio
grande
dam
and
irrigation
and
dam
company
in
174
united
states,
a
landmark
case.
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
held.
that
in
a
navigable
river
in
that
case,
the
rio
grande,
a
navigable
river
up
to
a
point,
the
state
of
new
mexico
was
--
i
believe
the
elephant
butte
dam,
i'm
not
sure
of
that
but
it
was
a
dam
construction
anyway.
and
by
that,
it
was
proposed
to
dry
up
the
tributaries,
not
the
mainstream,
but
the
tributaries.
united
states
had
a
stormy
course
in
that
--
in
that
case.
the
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well
your
honor,
we
make
this
distinction,
i
think
it's
valid.
i
started
to
say
the
--
the
rio
grande
case,
the
court
squarely
held
that
in
a
navigable
stream,
anything
that
impair
the
navigable
capacity
of
that
stream
transgress
the
act
of
congress
of
1890.
in
that
case,
the
transgression
was
to
occur
on
the
stream,
on
tributaries
of
a
navigable
stream.
and
this
court
said,
"you
can't
do
that."
that
congress
has
in
effect
under
it's
--
under
its
control
over
navigable
stream
complete
power
over
the
tributaries
as
well
as
the
stream
itself
to
the
extent
that
those
tributaries
are
necessary
to
maintain
a
navigable
capacity
of
the
stream.
we
say
therefore
that,
we
see
no
distinction
between
a
power
permit
up
on
the
river
in
the
east
issued
under
state
law
which
this
court
has
said
in
the
navigable
stream
when
the
government
preempts
the
stream,
it
becomes
a
nullity
and
then
no
compensation
involved.
we
say
there's
no
difference
between
that
and
appropriate
divide
if
you
can
gain
one
of
the
navigable
stream
that
when
the
congress
assuming
it
wasn't
appropriative
rights
your
honor,
we
believe
the
words
of
this
court
in
many
cases
to
the
effect
that
when
the
congress
exercises
its
power,
its
dominant
servitude
over
that
stream
under
the
navigation,
it's
power
into
the
commerce
clause
to
control
and
improve
navigation,
that
all
lesser
interest
must
give
way.
i
don't
care
whether
they
be
appropriative
right,
a
power
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
there's
nothing
in
the
project
act
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
oh,
i
believe
that
the
legislative
history
barely
read
shows
that
the
congress
recognized
they
were
allotting
to
the
various
states
water
over
and
above
they
then
uses.
and
as
senator
hayden
said
at
one
point
and
i
have
his
quote,
that
what
that
is
--
well
i
have
it
right
here,
"and
this
is
just
what
my
amendment
proposes."
he
said,
"we
have
--
we
have
allocated
the
water
and
then
who
shall
use
it
within
the
respective
states
is
a
matter
for
the
courts
to
the
state
or
for
the
state."
mr.
mark
wilmer
or
for
state
law,
yes.
i
--
i
--
i
know
this
one
of
the
--
the
more
or
less
major
--
major
but
problems
that
nevada
has
with
the
united
states
as
a
contention
that
the
contract
with
nevada
because
it
is
with
the
nevada
river
commission,
the
colorado
river
commission
state
agency
is
not
valid,
the
master
displaced
that,
the
master
said,
"no."
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
have
a
few
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
no
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
the
--
the
solicitor
general
your
honor
takes
the
position
and
the
united
states
takes
the
position
that
that
contract
is
(inaudible)
--
is
--
is
invalid
because
it
is
with
a
state
agency
and
not
with
the
individual
users.
but
the
united
states
further
takes
the
position
that
the
secretary
can
allocate
intrastate
according
to
priorities
as
he
sees
fit.
we
disagree
with
that.
mr.
mark
wilmer
oh
no,
we
do
not
contend
mr.
justice
douglas
that
the
project
act
controls
at
any
respect
the
use
of
water
intrastate.
we
have
made
no
such
contention.
our
sole
contention
is
limited
to
the
proposition
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
want
to
be
careful
what
i
say,
your
honor.
may
i
study
the
transcript
and
that's
without
new
orleans.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
are
in
disagreement,
correct.
now,
i
would
say
this
in
this
court.
the
arizona
contract
provides
that
the
secretary
shall
make
contracts
with
individuals,
corporations
who
aren't
qualified
under
the
reclamation
act
within
the
state
of
arizona.
we
originally
took
the
position
that
it
should
be
the
state
with
whom
he
contracts
and
the
state
apportioned
it
out.
the
master
held
that
under
the
arizona
contract
we
had
desi
--
delegated
to
the
secretary
the
right
to
make
those
contracts
and
it's
a
valid
provision.
we
have
not
accepted
that
--
to
that
holding
of
the
master.
so
that
in
any
event,
it
would
be
a
question
of
our
contract
having
made
that
designation.
the
secretary
has
an
agent
to
make
the
contracts
and
he
living
up
for
our
contract
rather
than
anything
in
the
project
act
which
says
to
the
contrary.
in
fact,
that
california's
position
is,
the
project
act
preserves
priority
of
appropriation
that
preserves
the
rights
of
various
users
to
come
and
demand
of
the
secretary
water
in
accordance
with
their
historic
appropriative
rights.
that
is
why
we
said
at
the
outset
that
california
in
effect
asked
this
court
to
tell
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
the
secretary
that
that
stream
is
to
continue
flowing
as
it
was
--
want
to
flow.
we
say
that
just
can't
be.
we
say
that
is
impossible
to
interrupt
the
regiment
of
that
stream
as
established
by
the
secretary
to
respond
to
appropriative
rights
as
we
--
excuse
me
--
as
we
know
them
normally.
we
say
it
just
isn't
in
the
cart.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
within
the
state,
if
the
state
wants
to
apply
that
law,
i
don't
think
it's
any
business
of
this
court.
i
don't
think
its
any
business
of
the
other
states
for
that
matter.
mr.
mark
wilmer
or
the
secretary.
might
i
make
one
further
suggestion
on
that
respect
--
respect
to
this
matter
of
appropriative
rights.
in
any
event,
as
nevada
has
suggested,
as
united
states
has
suggested
and
as
arizona
has
suggested,
there
has
been
a
complete
abandonment
of
any
attempt
to
live
up
to
appropriative
rights.
there
had
been
no
attempt
from
the
day
of
the
first
water
restored
on
that
project
to
this
day
to
take
any
water
in
accordance
for
the
appropriative
rights.
there
has
been
no
attempt,
whatever.
mr.
mark
wilmer
only
in
the
project
act,
if
that
is
true,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
the
master
has
held
the
language
of
section
6
in
satisfaction
of
present
perfected
rights
in
pursuance
of
article
viii
of
the
compact
is
a
protection
of
perfected
rights
existing
as
of
19
--
june
25,
1929,
when
the
project
act
became
effective.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well
your
honor,
they've
got
better
water
more
than
they
ever
had
before
1929.
mr.
mark
wilmer
none,
none.
it
--
we
--
we
have
a
mild
disagreement
with
the
masters
just
what
that
means,
we
think
if
it
means
anything,
it
means
1922
when
the
compact
was
signed.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
say
this
that
if
the
master's
holding
is
correct,
that
the
act
does
prefer
--
preserve
present
perfected
rights.
and
if
those
rights
are
not
protected
and
if
they
haven't
been
abandoned
then
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
gerlach
case
i
believe
that
would
be
to
the
effect
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
preempt
the
whole
stream
but
intended
to
make
compensation.
in
other
words,
i
would
say
then
that
if
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
project
act
and
if
they
haven't
been
abandoned,
then
there
may
be
a
basis
for
a
contention
if
they're
not
satisfied,
they're
entitled
to
compensation
but
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
none,
none.
mr.
mark
wilmer
there
would
be
none.
mr.
mark
wilmer
and
i
think
the
matter
have
raised
it,
if
it
please
the
court,
with
respect
to
what
then
existing
rights
the
congress
recognized.
your
--
this
is
--
this
court
has
said
that,
you've
said
it
with
not
--
with
respect
for
appropriative
rights
although
you
approached
it
in
one
case
in
which
mr.
justice
jackson
said
that
you'd
never
held
that
you
could
store
up
a
navigable
stream
in
a
bottle
of
water
and
sell
to
somebody
else
but
you
passed
the
question
and
answered
with
respect
to
appropriative
rights
in
a
navigable
stream.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well
to
that
extent,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
if
i
may
pause
for
just
a
moment
to
be
mildly
(inaudible)
it
reminds
--
my
conduct
reminds
me
of
the
statement
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
maybe
i
should
justify
my
conduct
by
saying
i
don't
know
what
i'm
thinking
if
i
hear
what
i
say
because
maybe
that's
the
case.
the
--
the
balance
of
the
legislative
history,
i
would
like
to
treat
them
quickly.
you
were
given
a
quotation
from
senator
phipps
in
which
he
perfected
his
amendment.
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
that
maybe
language
wasn't
quite
as
clear
as
was
indicated
by
california.
i
would
like
therefore
to
read
to
you
a
statement
made
by
senator
phipps
before
he
perfected
his
amendment,
shortly
before
that.
it's
in
congressional
record
at
page
390,
1928.
senator
phipps,
"just
a
word
--
in
a
word,
i
wish
to
state
that
my
understanding
of
the
effect
of
the
pending
amendment
is
that
under
it
or
under
a
state
compact,
the
upper
states
would
be
compelled
to
send
down
7,500,000
acre-feet."
it's
a
misprint.
it
should
be
75
million
acre
feet,
"of
water
in
10
years
or
to
put
it
the
other
way,
they
would
have
for
their
own
use
the
7,500,000
acre-feet
annually.
if
the
seven
state
compact
is
entered
into,
it
settled
the
question
as
far
as
the
future
upper
states'
basin
are
concerned."
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor
i
copied
this
fairly,
i'm
quite
sure
it
is
there,
we'll
supply
the
reference,
i'm
sure
it
is
there.
"if
we
enact
this
legislation
without
providing
for
a
six
state
compact,
the
discussions
on
the
differences
between
the
lower
basin
states
may
continue
indefinitely
and
the
upper
basin
states
have
no
assurance
if
they
are
going
to
be
protected
in
what
they
get,
what
they
conceive
to
be
their
rights.
the
language
of
the
amendment
providing
for
a
six
state
compact
has
incorporated
in
it
the
engagement
upon
the
part
of
california
that
she
will
not
take
for
her
consumptive
use
more
than
six
--
4,600,000
acre-feet
or
now
4,400,000
acre-feet
of
water
of
the
estimated
7,500,000
acres
annual
flow."
now,
i
don't
know
how
you're
going
to
talk
about
a
system
basis
of
accounting
when
you
talk
about
a
7,500,000
annual
flow,
talking
about
the
mainstream,
the
colorado
river.
now,
and
this
i
think
concludes
decisively
the
question.
subsequent
to
the
time
when
senator
phipps
had
perfected
his
amendment,
subsequent
to
the
time
he
had
added
the
seven
--
the
3
(a)
language
which
was
referred
to.
mr.
johnson,
"alright,"
this
is
a
colloquy
between
senator
johnson
and
senator
hayden.
senator
johnson,
the
manager
of
the
bill,
senator
hayden,
the
manager
of
the
amendment.
"now,
in
the
division
of
water
that
the
senate
saw
fit
to
impose
yesterday,
in
the
division
of
water
which
the
senate
sought
to
impose
yesterday,
arizona
had
2,800,000
feet
and
3,500,000
feet
from
the
gila,
did
it
not?"
mr.
hayden,
"correct."
now
in
other
words,
senator
hayden
--
johnson
said,
"you
got
2,800,000
didn't
you,
plus
the
gila
on
the
division
we
saw
fit
to
make
yesterday?"
and
that
was
the
division
when
senator
hayden
said,
"i
want
to
vote
upon
this
question
and
nothing
else,
the
division
of
water."
mr.
johnson,
"making
6,300,000
acre-feet,
california
was
given,
with
its
claims
at
its
perfected
rights,
4,400,000
acre-feet.
that
is
correct
is
it
not?
alright,
now
you
wish
to
deduct
from
the
burden
that
has
imposed
that
upon
--
now
you
wish
to
deduct
from
the
burden
that
is
imposed
by
water
that
goes
to
mexico
first,
3,500,000
acre
feet,
do
you
not?"
"i
do."
mr.
hayden.
mr.
johnson,
"then
you
wish
to
put
upon
california
and
arizona
one
of
them
having
then
2,800,000
acre-feet
and
the
other
4,400,000
acre-feet,
the
burden
equal
share,
do
you
not?"
mr.
johnson,
"alright
that
is
just
what
i
wanted
to
demonstrate."
mr.
hayden,
"the
senator
is
unwilling
to
do
that?"
mr.
johnson
"of
course
i'm
unwilling
to
do
that."
mr.
johnson
"let
us
say,
just
by
way
of
example,
that
2,000,000
acre-feet
would
be
utilized
by
mexico,
i'm
unable
to
say
how
much
it
would
be
but
a
while
ago
some
senator
upon
the
floor
used
that
as
an
example.
that
2,000,000
acre-feet
might
be
ultimately
allowed
to
mexico
under
your
plan
then
1,000,000
acre-feet
would
have
to
go
before
by
california,
1,000,000
acre-feet
by
arizona."
mr.
hayden
"yes."
mr.
johnson
"that
would
leave
then
for
california,
3,400,000
acre-feet."
mr.
hayden
"and
for
arizona,
in
the
mainstream,
1,800,000
acre-feet."
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
it
is,
your
honor,
i'm
sure
--
i
will
check
these
and
we'll
supply
the
clerk
with
the
reference
because
i
--
i
apologize
for
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
for
not
--
including
it,
i
did
with
some.
mr.
johnson
--
now
hayden
said,
"and
for
arizona
in
the
mainstream
1,800,000."
mr.
johnson
"yes,
with
350,000
--
3,500,000
added
thereto
from
the
gila."
in
other
words,
here
is
a
clear
recognition
in
a
debate
in
a
colloquy
between
senator
johnson
and
senator
hayden
that
there
had
been
a
division
of
water
that
arizona
got
2,800,000
plus
the
gila,
that
california
got
4,400,000
and
that
the
mexican
burden
was
shared
equally.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
will
do
so
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well

mr.
mark
wilmer
the
reference
i
made
to
senator
hayden
statement
is
in
our
legislative
history
as
to
his
statement
that,
"what
my
bill
provides
is
for
division
of
water."
that's
in
our
legislative
history
at
page
45.
the
language
is
this,
"the
only
thing
required
in
this
bill
is
contained
in
the
amendment
that
i
have
offered,
that
there
shall
be
apportioned
to
the
state,
to
each
state,
its
share
of
the
water."
then
who
shall
obtain
that
water
is
relative
--
a
relative
order
of
priority
made
it
--
maybe
--
be
determined
by
the
state
courts.
senator
pittman
made
this
observation
in
the
debate,
"what
is
the
difficulty?"
this
is

legislative
history

now,
with
respect
to

that
is
in
--
sorry,
i
did
have

but
i
don't
have

--
the
quote,
it's
in
the
70th
congressional
record
at
232
on
december
7,
1928.
it
said,
"what
is
the
difficulty?"
we
have
only
minor
questions
involved
here.
there
is
practically
nothing
involved
except
the
dispute
between
the
states
of
arizona
and
california
in
regard
to
the
division
of
the
increased
water
that
will
be
impounded
by
in
the
proposed
dam.
that
is
all.
mr.
mark
wilmer
thank
you,
your
honor.
an
agreement
has
been
entered
into
between
the
seven
states
interested
in
the
river,
this
river
by
which
half
of
that
water
is
retained
in
the
four
upper
states
and
half
of
it
let
down
to
the
three
lower
states.
the
four
upper
states
have
ratified
the
agreement.
the
question
now
is
for
arizona
to
ratify
the
agreement.
arizona,
as
i
understand,
will
ratify
the
agreement
whenever
there's
--
whenever
there
shall
be
provided
in
the
bill
or
a
separate
agreement
between
nevada
and
arizona
and
california,
dividing
the
water
let
down
to
the
three
lower
states
of
the
3,500,000
acre-feet
of
water
let
down
that
river,
they
have
gotten
together
within
400,000
acre-feet.
they
have
got
to
get
together
and
if
they
do
not
get
together,
congress
should
bring
them
together.
now,
california
quoted
from
senator
phipps
with
respect
to
a
statement
he
made,
the
effect
that
he
didn't
see
why
the
gila
should
not
be
included.
i
would
direct
your
honors'
attention
to
our
legislative
histories,
pages
76,
77,
78
and
79
which
demonstrates
that
senator
phipps
was
under
a
misunderstanding.
he
thought
that
there
was
a
million
acre-feet
flowing
into
the
mainstream
from
the
gila
and
he
thought
that
arizona
was
desirous
of
retaining
control
of
that
million
acre-feet
as
well
as
the
uses
on
its
tributaries,
that
is
quite
clear.
but
it
was
explained
to
him
that
this
million
acre-feet
talked
about
was
merely
returned
flow
if
a
large
amount
of
colorado
river
water
were
diverted,
he
was
then
satisfied.
all
senator
phipps
was
talking
about
when
he
said
that
tributaries
should
be
included
was
his
misunderstanding
that
arizona
was
contending
that
gila
river
water
after
it
got
in
the
mainstream
should
be
likewise
exempt
for
the
benefit
of
arizona.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
our
legislative
history
has,
i
think
covered
in
detail,
at
least
we
have,
i
believe
conscientiously
tried
to
include
the
good
with
the
bad.
i'm
not
going
to
take
further
of
the
court's
time
in
reading
excerpts.
i
would
like,
however,
to
briefly
dwell
upon
the
administrative
interpretation
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
mainstream
or
other
water
and
as
to
whether
4
(a)
made
an
apportion.
the
court
will
recall
that
secretary
of
interior
wilbur
at
that
time
was
in
charge
of
this
matter.
he
was
from
california.
he
was
certainly
not
interest
--
disinterested
party
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
but
he
certainly
attempted
to
be
disinterested
and
we
think
he
was.
the
wilbur-healey
documents
contain
these
collection
of
the
various
hoover
dam
documents
and
also
an
explanation
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
wilbur,
as
to
what
he
had
done
implementing
the
project
act.
in
wilbur
and
healey,
the
hoover
dam
contract,
the
1933
edition
at
pages
41
and
42,
which
is
an
exhibit,
this
statement
occurs,
"the
department
has
promulgated
regulations
designed
to
assure
water
supply
to
arizona.
these
regulations
are
included
as
an
appendix
in
this
volume.
they
outlined
the
form
of
the
hoover
dam
water
delivery
contract
which
the
united
states
will
enter
into
with
arizona
upon
certain
conditions.
briefly,
the
contract
calls
for
the
delivery
of
2,800,000
acre-feet
annually.
in
return
for
which
arizona
undertakes
to
make
no
interference
with
the
diversion
by
other
government
contractors.
this
quantity
of
water
is
adequate
for
all
of
the
arizona
projects
below
hoover
dam
and
is
without
prejudice
to
the
power
of
parties
to
contract
from
the
future
for
a
delivery
of
additional
water
as
required."
then
this
significant
language,
"arizona
is
thus
offered
an
assurance
of
2,800,000
acre-feet
of
mainstream
water
that
given
an
opportunity
to
look
to
the
united
states
rather
than
to
an
agreement
with
the
other
states
for
a
delivery
of
that
quantity
of
water
in
return
for
an
agreement
not
to
interfere
with
the
diversions
of
resistive
states."
in
other
words,
in
1933,
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
in
making
a
regulation
which
proposed
a
contract
of
arizona
stated
that
he
was
allocating
to
arizona
2,800,000
acre-feet
of
mainstream
water.
now,
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
the
project
act,
there
were
a
number
of
contracts
entered
into
by
the
secretary.
the
california
contracts
were
pursuant
to
what
was
turned
a
seven-party
agreement.
in
other
words,
the
palo
verde
irrigation
district,
the
yuma
project
of
the
california
division,
that
is
the
sister
project
across
the
stream
from
the
arizona
project,
the
imperial
irrigation
district,
coachella
valley,
metropolitan
water
district,
city
and
county
of
san
diego.
now,
the
significant
thing
on
this
seven-party
agreement
is
this,
it
divided
the
proposed
water
delivery
contracts
up
into
several
priorities.
it
delivered
--
it
divided
them
up
into
four
priorities
which
were
termed
the
irrigation
priorities
and
the
metropolitan
water
district
priority.
the
significant
thing
is
that
as
to
the
fourth
and
fifth
priority,
both
of
which
were
allocated
to
the
metropolitan
water
district
and/or
the
city
of
los
angeles,
they
split
them
in
two.
the
first
was
550,000
acre-feet
which
will
--
with
the
agricultural
priorities,
equal
and
even
4,400,000
--
equal
and
even
4,400,000.
in
other
words,
at
that
time,
california
herself
understood
that
the
4,400,000
was
a
first
priority
and
in
their
own
seven-party
agreement
so
indicated.
now,
the
next
thing
that
is
significant
is
that
in
each
of
these
contracts,
including
the
arizona
contract,
the
secretary
contracts
to
deliver
storage
water.
he
does
not
contract
to
deliver
water
pursuant
to
any
scheme
of
priorities.
he
simply
contracts
to
deliver
out
of
storage
so
many
gross
acres
of
water
for
use.
in
fact,
the
palo
verde
contract
contained
this
provision.
this
was
cited
by
california
as
a
typical
contract
and
most
of
them
are
quite
similar
although
i'm
not
sure
this
particular
clause
appears
in
all
of
them.
section
4,
"whereas,
the
district
is
desirous",
and
this
is
appendix
to
the
master's
brief
number
--
number
8,
(inaudible).
"whereas
the
district
is
desirous
of
entering
into
a
contract
with
the
delivery
to
it
of
water
from
boulder
canyon
reservoir
and
it
is
to
the
mutual
interest
of
the
parties
hereto
that
such
contract
be
executed
and
the
rights
of
the
district
in
and
to
the
waters
of
the
rivers
be
hereby
defined."
in
other
words,
the
contract
itself
provides
that
it
defines
the
rights
of
the
district
in
and
to
the
river,
the
waters
of
the
river.
and
that
contract,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
strictly
a
storage
contract.
it
speaks
not
one
word
of
the
fact
that
the
delivery
is
to
--
pursuant
to
appropriative
rights,
pursuant
to
anything,
it's
a
straight
storage
contract.
i
think
i'm
perhaps
pursuing
this
rather
unnecessarily.
the
master
himself
has
reached
to
his
conclusion
that
the
interaction
of
the
section
4
(a)
and
5
plus
the
secretary's
contracts
have
resulted
in
an
allocation
of
the
entire
stream
flow.
at
page
224
and
225
of
his
report,
he
said
this,
"since
the
secretary
hasn't
intentionally
bound
himself
with
contractual
apportionment
substantially,
although
not
precisely,
along
the
lines
suggested
by
congress
as
fair
and
equitable
in
the
two
paragraphs
of
section
4
(a)
of
the
project
act,
that
section
has
been
used
as
a
guide
for
interpreting
and
defining
the
contractual
allocation.
applying
these
laws
to
the
contracts,
i
interpret
them
as
establishing
the
following
water
delivery
scheme.
the
secretary
in
his
discretion
decides
how
much
water
is
to
be
released
from
mainstream
reservoirs
at
any
particular
period.
the
amount
available
for
consumption
in
the
united
states
in
any
one
year
shall
be
the
amount
so
released
less
the
amount
necessary
to
satisfy
higher
priorities.
the
contracts
do
not
limit
the
secretary's
discretion.
they
operate
only
upon
the
mainstream
water
which
is
available
for
consumption
in
the
united
states.
they
refer
that
this
water
be
apportioned
as
follows,
of
the
first
7,000,005
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
in
any
one
year,
4.4
million
for
use
in
california,
2.8
million
in
arizona
and
0.3
in
nevada.
of
the
remaining
consumptive
use
during
the
--
the
year,
50%
were
used
in
california
and
50%
in
arizona,
subject
to
the
possibility
that
arizona's
share
maybe
reduced
46%
of
the
secretary's
contract,
to
keep
the
secretary
contracts
to
allocate
4%
of
the
surplus
to
arizona."
now,
i'd
like
to
drop
by
just
a
minute
mr.
justice
black,
if
i
might
and
say
this
because
i
didn't
think
i
answered
your
question
accurately
or
fairly.
under
the
master's
allocation,
there
is
no
draft
on
the
upper
basin.
under
the
master's
allocation
there
is
no
fixed
allocation
of
water.
there
is
no
finding
required
or
attempted
that
every
year
there
shall
be
7,500,000,
nothing
of
that
character.
he
says
that
of
the
water
available
for
use,
for
consumptive
use,
in
the
lower
basin,
be
it
7,500,000,
be
it
seven,
be
it
six,
be
it
four,
be
it
nine,
of
the
first
7,500,000,
this
is
how
it
goes,
2,800,000
to
arizona,
300,000
nevada,
4,400,000
to
california.
so
that
(inaudible)
--
i
think
i
didn't
make
it
clear
to
you
that
the
master's
allocation
does
not
impose
any
burden
upon
the
upper
basin
does
not
in
any
fashion
affect
the
upper
basin,
it
merely
says
that
that
water
which
is
here
physically
for
use.
this
is
how
i
want
it
divided.
this
is
how
i
said
the
project
act
divides
it.
i
think
that
that
probably
answers
your
honors'
question
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
this
enlarges
the
obligation
and
provision.
it
can't.
it
doesn't.
it
simply
divides
that
which
is
there
for
division,
no
more
and
no
less.
further
in
that
respect,
i
would
like
to
say
this,
i
may
have
misread
some
of
these
cases,
but
if
i
do
not
misread
them,
if
i
do
not
misread
the
chandler-dunbar
case,
i
do
not
know
how
it
lies
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
when
congress
has
taken
in
its
mighty
hands,
under
the
commerce
power
clause,
which
the
constitution
gives
it,
this
water
has
taken
it
in
its
hands
so
to
speak
and
has
said
this
is
how
it
shall
go.
this
is
how
we
shall
handle
it.
i
tell
the
secretary
first,
you
shall
operate
this
reservoir
and
this
dam
to
control
floods,
to
regulate
the
flow
of
the
river
and
in
aid
of
navigation,
secondly
and
thirdly.
but
fundamentally,
you
are
charged
with
the
obligation
of
operating
this
river
in
this
fashion.
now,
in
what
fashion
may
i
inquire,
should
this
court
then
put
its
hands
on
the
river
and
tell
the
secretary
how
he
is
to
operate
the
river
unless
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
only
thing
i
was
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
this,
that
if
what
california
suggests
should
be
attempted,
then
very
well,
the
constitutional
question
will
be
presented.
mr.
mark
wilmer
certainly,
certainly.
mr.
mark
wilmer
certainly.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no.
not
--
certainly
not,
your
honor.
i
--
i
agree
with
that
and
i
agree
wholeheartedly
and
i
think
your
honor
has
stated
the
--
the
central
issue
in
this
lawsuit
by
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
would
say
only
this
your
honor,
that
i
think
they
are
involved
to
this
extent
and
that
is,
you
would
certainly
interpret
the
--
the
--
or
you
certainly
interpret
what
you're
asked
to
do
in
this
decree
within
the
limits
of
the
constitutional
jurisdiction
granted
the
court.
i
would
certainly
not
think
that
--
that
the
california
argument
does
other
than
put
this
court
in
the
business
of
running
the
river,
put
this
court
in
the
business
of
telling
the
congress
and
the
secretary
how
that
river
is
to
be
operated.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct
your
honor,
yes.
and
i'm
saying
that
california's
arguments
are
invalid
because
they
suggest
the
contrary.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
granted
your
honor.
one
other
thing
if
i
might
in
passing
from
the
project
act
then
to
the
remaining
somewhat
we
regard
less
vital
questions
in
the
case.
i
would
ask
your
honors
to
take
a
look
at
the
language
of
section
4
(a)
again
and
section
8
(b).
8
(b)
is
the
provision
which
is
found
in
--
is
in
the
project
act,
the
appendix
of
the
master's
report
number
3
--
page
380,
389.
the
language
of
the
project
act
which
i
would
refer
to
is
the
last
portion
of
section
4
(a)
and
draw
this
thing
--
this
to
your
honors'
attention.
section
8
(a)
provides
in
--
8
(b)
provides
in
substance
that
the
united
states
in
administering
the
river,
in
the
contracting
for
use
of
power
or
water
for
irrigation
shall
observe
and
be
subject
to
and
control
anything
to
the
contrary
here
and
not
withstanding
by
the
terms
of
such
compact,
if
any,
between
the
states
of
arizona,
california
and
nevada
or
any
two
thereof.
or
the
equitable
division
of
the
benefits
including
power
arising
from
the
use
of
water
going
to
said
states,
subsidiary
to
and
consistent
with
said
colorado
river
compact
which
maybe
negotiated
and
approved
by
said
states
under
which
congress
shall
give
its
consent
and
approval
on
or
before
january
21,
1929.
the
terms
of
any
such
compact
included
between
said
states
and
approved
and
consented
to
by
congress
after
said
date
provided
that
in
the
latter
case,
such
compact
shall
be
subject
to
all
contracts,
if
any,
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
under
section
5
hereof,
prior
to
the
date
of
such
approval
and
consent.
now,
in
substance,
this
says
--
thank
you
--
this
says,
that
with
respect
to
any
compact
entered
into
by
any
of
the
three
states
or
any
two
of
them,
any
two
of
them
and
i
want
to
come
to
that
in
a
minute.
that
the
secretary
shall
be
bound
by
them
provided,
that
as
to
any
contracts
made
after
january
1,
any
compacts
made
after
january
1,
1929,
that
they
shall
be
subject
to
contracts
made
by
the
secretary.
the
legislative
history
of
that
is
this.
this
was
proposed
by
mr.
esquire,
a
nevada
witness
fairly
early
in
the
game.
and
he
explained
and
he
thought
it
was
proper
the
state
should
be
permitted
the
compact.
mr.
delph
carpenter
and
that
is
also
available,
in
testifying,
stated
that
the
reason
for
this
date
was
to
stay
the
hand
of
the
secretary
until
the
state
should
have
a
chance
to
compact.
in
other
words,
as
to
any
compacts
entered
into
prior
to
january
1,
1929,
the
government
was
to
be
bound
by
them.
as
to
any
compact
after
that
date,
then
the
government
was
bound
by
them
but
such
compact
was
subject
to
the
secretary's
contracts
made
prior
thereto.
now
i
ask
you
first
of
all,
on
what
basis
could
this
--
could
two
states
compact
with
respect
to
a
body
of
water
available
to
three
if
it
hadn't
already
been
divided.
now,
this
amendment
which
changed
it
from
three
states
to
two
states
or
more
was
contemporaneous
with
a
part
of
the
general
format
that
resulted
in
5
(a)
of
the
legislative
history
i've
just
given
you.
up
to
that
point,
this
provision
in
the
statute
had
been
three
states
only.
but
after
this
concept
of
the
--
shall
conform
to
the
language
of
section
5
shall
conform
to
section
4
(a)
after
that
language
came
into
the
picture
and
was
a
part
of
it,
then,
the
congress
changed
this
to
any
two
or
more
of
the
three
states.
i
respectfully
say
to
you
first
that
you
can't
have
two
states
dividing
up
water
belonging
to
three
unless
the
congress
has
already
divided
it.
mr.
mark
wilmer
except
they
could
change
it.
they
could
change
it,
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
other
words,
the
compact
in
4
(a)
was
pre-approved
by
congress.
that
was
something
which
they
only
had
to
approve
and
didn't
have
to
come
back
to
congress
but
congress
said
in
addition,
"now,
if
you
want
to
make
a
different
division,
the
authority
resides
in
section
8
(b).
you
can
divide
this
water
up
and
still
come
back
to
us.
but
california
maybe
only
gets
only
4,300,000,
maybe
nevada
and
arizona
wants
to
fool
around
a
little
bit
with
you."
but
the
significance
of
this
is
that
in
section
4
(a),
it
was
a
pre-approved
compact.
it
was
a
compact
which
did
not
need
to
come
back
to
congress.
in
section
8
(b),
a
compact
was
authorized
between
two
or
more
states.
but
that
had
to
come
back
to
congress
for
approval
as
if
the
secretary
had
made
any
contracts
because
they
didn't
compact
before
january
1,
then
his
contract
took
precedence.
i
say
the
first
point
is
this,
there
had
to
be
an
understanding
in
congress
that
the
water
had
already
been
allocated
otherwise,
could
nevada
and
arizona
take
some
water
away
from
california?
congress
certainly
didn't
consider
that
but
the
more
important
point,
i
want
to
suggest
to
the
court
is
this,
in
section
4
(a)
compact
--
in
the
section
4
(a)
compact
approved
in
advance
by
congress,
there
wasn't
any
such
provision.
there
wasn't
any
provision
in
the
4
(a)
compact
that
the
secretary's
contracts
took
precedence
or
didn't.
there
was
just
as
much
likelihood
that
the
4
(a)
compact
pre-approved
by
congress
wouldn't
be
made
for
a
year
or
two
years,
just
as
much
as
with
respect
to
8
(b),
just
as
much.
yet
in
8
(b),
which
was
not
the
allocation
made
by
congress
in
4
(a),
congress
said
that
the
secretary
contracts
before
you
do
this,
his
contracts
take
precedence.
but
we
say
that
decisively
--
decisively,
the
4
(a)
is
a
mandatory
allocation
that
congress
did
regard
it
as
a
mandatory
allocation
because
otherwise,
they
would
have
made
some
provision
for
the
secretary's
contracts
which
preceded
the
approval
of
the
pre-approved
4
(a)
compact,
otherwise
you
would
have
an
impossible
clash.
you'd
have
a
situation
of
arizona,
nevada
and
california
not
compacting
for
a
year.
there's
nothing
in
the
language
that
said
the
secretary's
hand
was
to
be
tied
in
connection
with
this
particular
thing,
this
particular
provision
in
the
legislative
history.
so
we
say
that
we
do
believe
our
argument
that
it
is
a
mandatory
--
a
formula
is
very
persuasive.
we
say
otherwise
there
would
have
been
language
in
the
4
(a)
that
would
have
made
some
provision
for
the
secretary's
contract
deviating
from
the
allocation
made
therein.
otherwise,
you
would
have
contracts
for
permanent
service,
clashing
with
a
compact
which
the
congress
had
already
approved.
we
did
not
make
that
argument
before
the
special
master,
frankly,
hadn't
occurred
to
us.
but
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
once
said
that
the
wisdom
sometimes
never
comes
and
therefore
when
it
comes
late,
you
shouldn't
ignore
it.
well,
we
had
several
attacks
of
character
unfortunately
in
this
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
briefly,
if
i
might,
advert
for
just
a
moment
to
the
master's
finding
with
respect
to
present
perfected
rights.
i
have
stated
--
we
have
stated
that
we
don't
regard
it
as
a
magnitude
in
this
case
but
we
do
regard
it
as
having
consequences
for
this
reason.
the
master
has
suggested
that
subsequent
to
this
termination
of
this
case,
that
all
parties
shall
file
their
appropriative
rights
with
the
secretary,
i
believe
it
is
and
then
if
we
don't
agree
then
there's
going
to
be
another
great
big
lawsuit.
well,
if
we
have
a
lawsuit,
we'll
have
lawsuits.
we
believe,
however,
that
the
present
perfected
rights
provision
of
section
6
relates
only
to
a
satisfaction
of
the
requirements
of
article
viii
of
the
compact.
and
that
has
gone
back
in
the
upper
basin.
we
believe
that
congress
simply
said,
if
they
had
intended
to
preserve
all
present
perfected
rights,
they
would
have
said
so,
they
don't
need
to
say
in
pursuance
of
article
viii.
they
would
have
said,
all
present
perfected
rights
shall
be
respected
but
they
did
not
say
that.
they
said
in
pursuance
of
article
viii.
they
had
previously
rejected
the
notion
that
present
--
that
appropriative
rights
shall
be
respected.
and
they
therefore,
we
believe
we're
simply
providing
that
with
respect
to
the
provision
of
article
viii
of
the
compact,
this
discharged
that
requirement.
now
on
that
connection,
the
master
held
and
i'm
not
going
into
a
compact
argument,
but
section
6
of
the
compact,
contains
this
language,
"that
if
there
is
a
dispute
between
two
or
more
signatory
states,
between
two
or
more
signatory
states
of
the
compact
with
respect
to
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system
not
covered
by
the
compact,
then
the
following
shall
occur."
now,
you
have
a
flat
out
finding
there,
a
flat
out
contract
--
compact
provision
but
there
are
waters
not
covered
by
the
compact
because
that's
what
it
says
as
to
--
with
respect
to
waters
in
the
colorado
river
system
not
covered
by
the
compact.
we
took
the
position
that
that
did
again
indicate
that
lower
basin
tributaries
were
not
involved.
the
master
in
a
sense
agreed.
he
said
that
that
demonstrates
that
there
is
only
inter-basin
results
--
inter-basin
effects
of
the
compact.
it
is
not
an
intra
based
and
interstate
matter
and
that
therefore,
that
language
refers
to
in
intra-basin
interstate
rights.
so
we
say
again
if
that
is
true,
if
that
language
of
article
6
says
that
the
lower
basin
tributaries
interstate
of
the
lower
basin
are
not
involved,
then
again,
the
present
perfected
rights
means
only
against
the
upper
basin.
the
--
the
interpretation
you
have
suggested
is
that
of
--
of
the
--
of
--
representative
swing
that
has
--
wipes
out
appropriative
rights.
senator
johnson
made
a
very
interesting
remark
in
which
he
said,
"oh,
one
of
these
days
you're
going
to
regret
it
if
you
maintain
these
theories
of
appropriative
rights
in
the
stream."
that
is
quoted
in
our
legislative
history.
in
summary,
with
respect
to
this
phase
of
our
case,
we
would
simply
say
again,
that
there
is
no
doubt,
one,
the
colorado
river
is
a
navigable
stream.
that
is
judicially
established
as
well
as
factual.
secondly,
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
took
in
control
of
the
entire
stream
and
stored
the
water.
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
gave
directions
to
the
secretary
as
to
what
he
was
to
do
with
that
water
and
how
was
he
to
handle
it
and
the
purposes
for
which
he
was
to
put
it
--
for
which
he
was
to
put
it.
and
that
therefore,
the
law
is
clear
that
this
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
it's
a
matter
of
interpreting
the
project
act
to
determine
what
congress
intended
in
what
language
congress
spoke.
what
meaning
is
to
be
inscribed
to
their
words?
now,
the
balance
of
the
time
and
i
will
quit
at
the
end
of
the
day.
i
want
to
comment
briefly
upon
california's
talked
about
water
supply.
the
problem
we
face
is
one
which
is
not
unusual
in
this
type
of
a
case.
originally
before
the
congress
when
she
was
opposing
the
central
arizona
project,
passed
the
senate
twice
and
was
defeated
in
the
house
every
time.
her
position
was
that
water
was
not
legally
available
dependent
upon
an
interpretation
of
the
compact
and
related
legal
documents.
in
fact,
my
good
friend
mr.
ely
in
numerous
times
said
it
was
a
question
of
law,
nothing
to
do
with
this.
now
that
that
question
has
been
resolved,
becomes
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
water
supply
is
adequate.
we
believe
that
with
the
master
that
whether
or
not,
there
7,600,000,
7,800,000
or
seven
million
ten,
it
is
of
no
consequence
so
far
as
the
determination
of
this
case
is
concerned.
the
master
said
only
this,
that
he
was
--
no,
let
me
just
stop
for
a
moment.
the
very
argument
that
california
has
made
today
was
made
just
as
loudly,
just
as
strongly
before
the
special
master
in
new
york,
august
17th,
18th
and
19th
i
believe,
before
this
report
was
filed
on
december
5th.
the
draft
report
of
the
master
had
been
circulated.
three
days
of
argument
was
had
in
which
these
very
arguments
were
made
that
are
now
being
made
to
you.
the
master
said,
"if
i
believed,
if
i
had
any
reason
to
believe
that
any
of
these
dire
consequences
which
you
predict
would
ensue,
i
would
very
carefully
reexamine
the
situation,
i
would
strain
for
an
interpretation
which
would
avoid
them."
and
he
took
the
matter
under
advisement.
and
in
december
5th,
he
then
filed
this
present
report
with
respect
first
to
the
suggestion
that
the
case
be
reopened,
for
the
purpose
of
taking
testimony
in
the
upper
basin
as
to
the
depletion
there.
i
don't
know
quite
how
the
master
could
go
on
a
so
to
speak
frolic
and
detour
of
his
own
in
the
upper
basin
to
gauge
their
future
depletions
without
the
upper
basin
being
present.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
after
he
circulated
his
draft
report
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
remember.
at
least
not
the
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
it
was
a
motion
to
reopen
for
the
purpose
of
offering
additional
truth
and
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
there
were
--
two
things
were
done
your
honor.
there
was
a
proffer
of
additional
evidence,
some
--
i
forgot
quite
a
volume
of
it
which
purported
to
show
the
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
it's
a
bifurcated
situation
your
honor.
first,
they
offered
additional
documentary
evidence,
quite
a
volume
which
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
actually
tendered
which
they
said
showed
the
legislative
and
administrative
interpretation
subject
to
1929.
the
master
heard
them
on
that,
took
it
under
advisement
and
rejected
the
offer
stating
in
his
report
that
he'd
examine
each
of
the
documents
in
detail
that
if
they
proved
anything,
they
prove
nothing.
and
that
is
that
arizona
had
taken
many
positions,
california
many
positions,
but
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
merely
been
scrupulously
careful
not
to
take
sides
in
the
controversy
so
he
rejected
that.
the
second
prong
of
the
of
the
--
of
the
offer
was
that
the
case
be
reopened
for
the
purpose
of
taking
testimony
with
respect
to
probable
depletions
in
the
upper
basin
saying
that
that
issue
had
not
been
litigated
and
that
they
had
not
been
fairly
apprised
that
this
was
a
problem
and
arizona's
position
was
so
and
so.
just
briefly
and
i'm
sure
they're
in
the
record,
on
august
--
on
may
of
1957,
the
year
in
five
or
six
months
before
the
case
closed,
arizona
filed
a
memorandum
and
served
it
on
the
parties
saying
what
we're
saying
today,
which
is
that
the
navigational
problem
involved,
the
project
act
should
be
construed
because
of
the
overwriting
power
of
the
united
states
congress.
so
california
was
unnoticed
there.
on
august
5th,
1957,
arizona
filed
what
was
denominated
and
amended
in
supplemental
statement
of
position
in
which
we
put
california
and
noticed
that
we
were
retreating
from.
we
were
in
effect
abandoning
our
pleaded
position
from
the
--
which
had
been
originally
filed,
stating
that
we
felt
that
we
were
in
error.
we
also
filed
at
that
time
in
a
memorandum
entitled
decisive
effect
of
the
compact
in
the
project
act
which
fully
explored
although
not
in
as
great
detail
and
with
some
departures
of
what
we're
now
saying
so
that
as
of
august
5th,
in
1957,
california
knew
that
arizona
had
retreated
from
her
position.
and
then
before
the
end
of
the
california
case
we
filed
and
proffered
amended
pleadings
which
the
master
rejected
and
as
he
said
in
his
brief
it'd
be
strange
in
the
case
of
this
magnitude
that
parties
were
held
to
their
pleadings,
i
find
it
unnecessary
to
rule
upon
it.
so
that
when
we
are
confronted
with
the
statement
that
this
is
a
strange
theory
that
suddenly
awakened
out
of
the
deep
somewhere
and
originally
confronted
california
at
this
late
hour,
it
just
didn't
so
because
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
california
speaks
of
the
master's
patentable
invention.
mr.
mark
wilmer
speaks
of
the
fact
that
arizona's
position
was
pleaded
so
and
so
and
that
this
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
this
wasn't
litigated
that
the
--
what
you
call
it?
well,
frankly,
we
never
knew
whether
the
special
master
had
part
of
a
permitted
amendment
or
not.
don't
know
the
date.
the
solicitor
general
expressed
an
opinion
maybe
he
didn't.
we
tendered
the
pleadings
nonetheless
because
this
court
was
in
recess
at
that
time
so
there
would
be
no
question
but
what
california
fully
understood
before
her
case
was
closed.
but
arizona
had
completely
abandoned
her
theory
of
treaty
equating
to
the
gila
and
all
the
rest
of
that
stuff
which
we
finally
could
not
support.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
proposed
--
well,
your
honor
that
was
not
in
detail.
it
simply
was
a
proposal
that
the
master
reopen
the
case
for
the
purpose
of
taking
evidence
as
to
the
probable
future
depletions
in
the
upper
basin
bearing
upon
water
supply.
mr.
mark
wilmer
none,
none
at
all.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
speaking
of
california's
assertion
is
not
our
concessions,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
pre
--
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
very
difficult.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
concur
completely
with
the
master
that
this
is
a
statutory
interpretation
case.
we
concur
fully
with
the
master
that
the
formula
which
he
has
proposed
divides
what
water
there
is
there
in
accordance
with
the
congressional
intention.
and
that
therefore
the
amount
of
water
that
is
there
is
without
relevance
to
this
case.
mr.
mark
wilmer
correct.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
wilmer
it
relates
to
these
charts
your
honor
as
seen
and
to
many
shall
i
say,
unilateral
figures
that
have
been
presented
to
you
which
have
--
we
take
little
relation
to
the
record?
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
approach
which
california
takes
is
this,
your
honor
and
the
master
very
nicely
exposed
that
in
his
report.
california
says,
for
purposes
of
the
limitation
act,
3
(a)
shall
be
construed
as
a
system
proposition.
in
other
words,
that
california
is
limited
to
4,400,000
out
of
7,500,000
of
system
water,
not
mainstream
water.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
that's
why
we
say
if
its
mainstream
water,
the
case
is
over
as
far
as
we're
concern,
we
want
it.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor
that
is
precisely
why
we
quoted
justice
holmes
at
the
outset
of
this
case.
the
law
is
clear
and
the
material
facts
are
few.
what
california
has
offered
here
in
the
way
of
these
many,
many
pages
of
water
supply
testimony
has
no
relevance
to
a
determination
of
this
case
if
the
master
is
correct
and
if
we
are
correct.
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement.
it
is
a
question
of
the
division
of
the
water
which
the
statute
--
which
congress
dealt
within
the
project
act
and
the
master
has
dealt
with
that
and
has
said
of
that
supply
it
shall
be
divided
as
follows.
mr.
mark
wilmer
might
be
necessary
to
re
--
to
refer
the
matter
back
to
the
master,
your
honor,
i
--
i
wouldn't
want
to
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
you
could
not
do
so,
your
honor
if
we
are
correct
in
the
fact
that
this
is
a
navigable
stream
stored
by
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
over
the
stream.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor,
we've
been
so
very
sure
the
master
is
right,
i
really
haven't
thought
about
it.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'd
say
we've
been
so
very
sure
the
master
is
right
that
i
haven't
given
very
much
thought.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
your
honor,
i
realized
that.
if
the
master
is
wrong
that
this
project
act
is
improperly
construed
then
i
presume
it
becomes
a
matter
of
determining
how
much
of
this
system
water
california
is
to
get
and
how
much
arizona
is
to
get.
may
i
just
pursue
that
just
a
moment?
the
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
california
theory,
as
we
understand
it
is
this,
under
the
project
act,
the
california
limitation
act
limits
california
to
four
million
four
of
system
3
(a)
one,
system
as
distinguished
to
mainstream.
she
next
says
that
there
is
available
in
the
lower
basin
tributary
wise,
two
million
acre-feet
of
use.
she
says
that's
all
put
to
use.
so
therefore
there
is
a
total
available
to
california
in
the
mainstream
of
her
portion
four
million
four
of
the
remaining
five
million
3
(a)
water
and
she
gets
half
the
surplus.
in
other
words,
as
the
master
has
analyzed
the
thing,
the
entire
thrust
of
the
california
position
is
that
she
first
charges
arizona
--
arizona
rights
with
two
million
acre-feet
on
the
tributaries
against
the
3
(a)
limitation
which
therefore
puts
in
the
mainstream
two
million
more
feet
of
water
for
surplus.
and
she
says
now,
we
get
our
four
million
four
out
of
this
plus
half
the
surplus.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
i
would
--
again
that
it
is
yes
your
honor.
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well
your
honor,
i
probably
should
not
attempt
to
interpret
california's
position.
i
have
understood
it
to
be
one
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
excuse
me.
mr.
mark
wilmer
may
i
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question?
if
the
position
of
arizona
is
correct
that
this
project
act
dealt
with
mainstream
water
but
our
position
and
the
master's
position
is
wrong
that
there
was
a
--
an
allocation
of
mainstream
water.
oh,
i
would
answer
that
this
way
your
honor.
i
do
not
conceive
it
to
be
--
let
me
paraphrase
that,
if
this
is
a
navigable
stream
and
if
congress
has
in
the
exercise
of
its
dominant
servitude
taken
control
over
that
stream
and
has
stored
that
water,
then
i
think
only
congress
has
the
right
to
say
who
shall
take
it
out
of
that
stream
and
how
that
stream
shall
be
operated.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
i
disagree
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
do
so.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'm
not
that
unreasonable,
your
honor.
almost
--
no,
i
beg
your
honor's
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
didn't
mean
to
evade
your
question.
i
--
i
would
simply
say
this,
as
i
understand
the
question
of
the
--
the
thrust
of
your
question,
it
is
one,
this
is
in
fact
a
mainstream
project.
congress
has
in
fact
stored
this
water
as
justice
brandies
held
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
congress
under
the
commerce
--
under
the
--
its
commerce
clause
power.
i
would
then
braving
the
question
your
honor
if
anyone
but
congress
has
a
right
to
say
how
that
water
is
to
be
used
because
it
is
done
so
pursuant
to
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
that
was
the
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
but
that's
the
conclusion,
i
quickly
answer
it
your
honor,
it
would
have
to
go
back.
mr.
mark
wilmer
(inaudible)
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
i
--
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor,
yes
and
i
would
--
i
don't
see
there's
any
escape
from
that.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
see
no
escape
from
it
because
to
--
to
distribute
it
in
accordance
with
the
rule
laid
down
in
nebraska
versus
wyoming
and
otherwise
many
more
findings
was
to
be
made
than
has
been
made
here,
many
more
would
have
to
be
made.
mr.
mark
wilmer
may
i
--
excuse
me.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
may
i
answer
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
except
for
this
one
thing
your
honor
that
if
the
present
perfected
rights
has
senior
rights
which
the
master
interpreted,
they
are
well
within
the
ceiling
which
the
master
has
placed.
mr.
mark
wilmer
they're
well
within
the
amount
available
to
california
for
those
rights
that's
why
i
corrected
my
statement
earlier
that
it
was
2,159,000
and
that
it
was
a
johnson
claim.
mr.
mark
wilmer
assuming
their
contract
rights
are
not
satisfactory.
may
i
just
say
in
--
in
passing
your
honor,
there
is
--
i
indicated
earlier
great
question
in
our
mind
at
least
as
to
the
validity
of
the
california
appropriative
rights.
they
were
taken
by
contract
from
old
mexico,
not
by
virtue
of
diversions
from
the
stream.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
i
--
its
why
i
answered
justice
harlan
as
i
did
that
if
that
is
the
rule
that
governs
this
case
then
there's
many
more
days
of
testimony
to
be
taken.
mr.
mark
wilmer
so
that
--
i
--
i
would
answer
you
directly
mr.
justice
harlan
that
if
the
rule
of
this
case
with
respect
to
the
disposal
of
this
stored
water
is
appropriative
rights
and
according
to
their
seniority
that
that
can
be
done
upon
the
question
that
this
case
is
not
ready
for
adjudication.
mr.
mark
wilmer
or
our
suggestion
that
it's
a
formula,
a
re
--
mandatory
formula
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
i
--
i
agree
with
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
if
congress
didn't
divide
the
water
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
that's
it.
mr.
mark
wilmer
sure.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well
your
honor,
i
am
very
hopeful
that
you
will
be
here
but
i
fiddled
out
for
about
being
back
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
here
myself.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
may
i
just
bring
this
to
your
attention.
and
that's
what
i
started
to
discuss
briefly
this
matter
of
water
supply.
one
thing
that
has
not
been
emphasized
has
not
been
made
clear
is
the
fact
that
we're
talking
about
many
years
in
the
future.
in
the
opening
brief
of
california,
she
made
the
statement
and
that
is
answered
in
our
answering
brief
that
they
were
participating
projects
in
the
upper
basin
storage
which
had
been
approved
for
priority
of
completion.
we
responded
in
our
answering
brief
that
she
had
misstated
the
statute
that
they
were
approved
for
priority
of
planning
for
completion.
she
has
not
denied
that.
she
now
comes
back
in
our
answering
brief
with
an
excerpt
from
a
hearing
held
in
1961
and
the
testimony
of
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
palmer.
i'm
merely
asking
that
the
court
make
note
of
this
in
their
brief
because
as
it
stands
it
is
not
servicing.
it
is
headed
in
her
brief
as
a
footnote,
testimony
of
a
mr.
palmer
with
respect
to
future
development
in
the
upper
basin.
in
the
hearing
from
which
it
is
taken,
this
is
the
caption,
"estimated
stream
for
depletions,
upper
colorado
river
basin,
100
year
period
ending
2062."
the
table
which
is
reproduced
does
not
have
the
caption
which
says,
"present
and
future
depletions
upper
colorado
river
basin,
100
year
forecast
beginning
--
ending
2062."
the
thing
that
justice
frankfurter
has
brought
in
my
mind
--
supposing
this
was
the
second
year
of
the
civil
war
and
we're
looking
ahead
a
like
period
of
time.
i
don't
know
of
any
hundred
year
forecast,
a
hundred
years
ago
would
do
very
similar
as
to
conditions
today.
that
is
the
whole
problem
that
is
inherent
in
this
lawsuit
in
the
california
water
studies.
they're
based
upon
assumptions.
they're
based
upon
forecast
of
water
supply
that
may
possibly
be
used
a
hundred
years
hence
and
as
united
states
said
that
they
had
mortgaged
arizona's
future
today
for
their
needs
of
tomorrow.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that's
right.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
that
is
the
basis
--
excuse
me.
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
master
distinguished
nebraska
versus
wyoming
and
the
other
cases.
he
said
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
stored
water
supply.
this
allocates
by
a
flexible
formula
the
water
that's
available
any
one
year,
and
i
completely
agree
with
your
honor's
statement
but
that
is
true.
that
it
is
a
flexible
formula,
good
into
the
indefinite
future
unless
changes
occur
and
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
with
congress,
certainly.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
the
secretary
has
contracted
for
all
of
the
water,
your
honor
--
the
secretary
has
contracted
for
all
of
the
water.
mr.
mark
wilmer
for
a
permanent
supply,
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no
sir,
not
under
the
statute.
it
says,
shall
be
for
permanent
service
and
that's
what
the
master
has
held
that
it's
for
permanent
service.
now
i
take
it,
the
only
thing
might
happen
would
be
if
somebody
doesn't
need
the
water,
he
reallocates
it,
maybe
you
might
have
a
problem
but
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
why
we
have
contend
it,
if
it
please
the
court
for
the
mandatory
formula.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
why
we
have
contended
for
the
mandatory
formula
that
we
believe
that
that
will
settle
for
all
time
the
--
the
question
of
who
gets
what
water.
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
if
the
water
is
there.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
i
--
my
time
is
running
short,
i
had
much
more
to
cover.
i
am
not
going
to
attempt
to
do
it.
i
would
simply
say
this,
that
california
has
made
many
assertions
of
shortage.
we
have
stated
and
now
stated
to
the
court
and
master
found
that
there
are
substantial
wastage
in
the
imperial
valley.
in
the
draft
report,
the
master
made
no
finding
of
waste.
we
didn't
think
it
was
material.
we
asked
for
no
findings
on
it.
but
california
made
such
a
commotion
about
a
shortage
that
he
made
a
finding
in
his
report
filed
with
this
court
that
undoubtedly,
there
was
substantial
wastage
in
the
imperial
valley
and
that
water
could
be
far
more
economically
used.
now,
i
would
like
to
if
i
might
just
to
(inaudible)
there
was
introduced
in
the
course
of
the
trial
below
for
a
purpose
of
demonstrating
in
quick
fashion
whether
or
not
there
is
waste
in
the
imperial
valley.
because
we
say,
that
if
there
is
waste
--
if
there
is
waste,
if
california
is
throwing
away
water,
then
while
it's
none
of
our
business
in
so
far
as
our
present
usage
are
concerned,
it
is
our
business
if
she's
claiming
a
water
right
on
it.
this
if
it
please
the
court,
this
plaintiff's
exhibit
number
237
in
evidence
admitted
on
the
7th
--
5th
of
july
1957.
this
is
the
alamo
river
looking
upstream
from
the
bridge
near
the
mountain.
now
that,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
not
the
inflow
into
the
imperial
valley.
this
is
the
discharge
from
the
imperial
valley.
this
is
the
amount
of
water
in
one
river
every
minute
flowing
out
of
the
imperial
valley
and
into
the
salton
sea.
now
it
is
said
that
a
picture
is
worth
a
thousand
words
and
if
anyone
can
look
at
that
picture
and
not
say
there
is
waste
occurring
at
that
point,
of
course,
that
privilege.
now,
that
is
only
one.
mr.
mark
wilmer
it
has
reference
your
honor
only
to
one
thing.
we
offered
it
only
because
of
california's
talked
about
rights
and
shortage.
and
the
only
purpose
of
this
is
to
say
that
if
california
is
in
short
supply,
quit
throwing
that
water
in
the
salton
sea
a
million
acre-feet
a
year
and
start
using
some
of
that
for
a
--
for
a
metropolitan.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
it's
to
demonstrate,
if
it
please
the
court
that
--
that
if
they
are
claiming
a
phase
shortage,
they
have
a
source
to
turn
to
as
well
as
arizona's
supply.
we
would
welcome
this
amount
of
water
in
arizona
and
we
would
put
it
to
beneficial
use
(inaudible)
mr.
mark
wilmer
this,
if
it
please
the
court
is
the
other
stream,
flowing
out
of
imperial
and
into
the
salton
sea
not
just
one,
two.
i
simply
submit
to
the
court
that
they
can
talk
about
leeching
but
i
know
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
surely,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor
has
correctly
interpreted
my
motives.
i
think
i
remember
once
someone
saying
with
a
long
practice
(inaudible)
in
discerning
motives,
that
it
--
i
do
--
because
if
i
do
interpret
yours,
the
depth
of
your
base
heart,
that
my
heart
isn't
based
but
you
have
correctly
interpreted
my
motives,
your
honor.
i
think
i
can
conclude
to
that
your
honor
because
we
went
to
another
subject
unless
the
court
desires
to
sit
beyond
two
thirty
with
me.
mr.
mark
wilmer
may
it
please
the
court.
well,
we
have
been
handed
by
counsel
for
california
a
portion
of
the
transcript
which
is
headed
uncontradicted
testimony
of
jr
ryder
which
relates
to
project
deficiencies.
we
are
not
here
to
attempt
to
comb
the
record
nor
are
we
here
to
make
findings
which
the
master
refused
to
make.
we
simply
say
so
that
it
will
not
be
assumed
that
because
we
have
not
contested
the
statement
that
we
ascend
to
it.
we
simply
say
that
we
do
not
agree.
we
simply
say
that
a
proper
investigation
of
the
testimonial
offered
would
indicate
quite
to
the
contrary
but
i
don't
think
this
court
is
the
place
that
we
should
attempt
to
resolve
questions
of
fact.
i'd
like
to
briefly,
if
might,
turn
to
section
8
(b)
again
because
the
reading
of
that
demonstrates
to
us
at
least
two
things.
i'm
not
going
to
read
it
because
it
is
long
but
its
in
substance
and
briefly
provided
that
the
united
states,
in
constructing,
managing,
and
operating
the
dam
reservoir
canals
and
other
works,
including
the
appropriation,
delivery
and
use
of
water
for
generation
of
power,
irrigation,
and
other
uses
shall
be
subject
to
and
shall
conform
to
the
terms
of
a
compact
if
any
between
the
states
of
arizona,
california,
and
nevada
or
any
two
thereof.
now,
that
is
most
unusual
language
in
directing
that
the
secretary
shall
conform
to
a
compact
made
by
two
of
the
three
states
and
we
think
that
it
requires
some
searching
to
find
out
why
that
is.
it
then
provides,
of
course,
that
if
the
compact
is
made
and
approved
by
the
congress
prior
to
january
1,
1929,
that
shall
govern
the
secretary's
contracts
and
that
if
made
subsequent
thereto
the
secretary's
contract
shall
govern.
i
would
say
in
passing
that
originally,
the
period
allowed
for
compact
was
a
year,
but
apparently
in
the
haste
of
the
closing
of
this
congress
or
the
holiday
season
and
all,
they
didn't
extend
the
period
because
the
act
was
approved
on
december
21st
and
it
was,
of
course,
seven
or
eight
days
before
the
period
expire.
what
i'm
leading
to
is
this.
the
debates
in
congress
emphasized
and
made
clear
one
thing,
a
contest
between
states'
rights
and
the
power
of
the
federal
judiciary,
the
power
in
the
federal
congress.
all
through
these
debates,
the
question
was
not,
“has
congress
by
this
legislation,
allocated
the
water?”
the
question
was,
“can
congress
constitutionally
do
so?”
and
as
you
have
heard
before,
senator
king
at
one
point
said,
“i,
in
effect
challenge
the
right
of
the
federal
government
to
put
his
mighty
hands
down
upon
this
river.”
and
the
other
point
said,
“the
states'
rights
are
being
destroyed.”
now,
nothing
is
said
in
this
authorization,
this
suggestion
of
a
compact
which
was
to
govern
the
secretary
about
appropriative
rights.
how
do
you
square
the
notion,
appropriate
--
appropriative
rights,
rights
of
prior
appropriation
should
survive
the
compact
or
should
survive
the
project
act
when
nothing
is
said
in
here
with
respect
to
preserving
those
rights?
this
is
a
carte
blanche
authorization
to
the
states
to
enter
into
a
compact
and
there's
nothing
whatever
with
respect
to
recognizing
appropriative
rights.
mr.
mark
wilmer
we
think
it
did,
your
honor.
we
think
it
did
and
let
me
--
let
me
just
pursue
that
on
a
moment
if
i
may.
how,
if
it
please
the
court,
unless
congress
had
divided
the
water,
could
do
if
the
states
make
a
compact?
in
other
words,
unless
the
congress
felt
that
it
set
apart
to
each
of
these
states
their
aliquot
part
of
the
water
could
have
authorized
two
of
them
to
compact.
certainly,
it
wouldn't
be
said,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
arizona
and
nevada
could
compact
and
cut
california
out.
you
can't
make
a
division
of
something
unless
you
own
it,
unless
it's
confined
to
your
jurisdiction,
and
it's
within
your
custody.
we
say,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
this
is
another
indication
that
congress
did
say
they
have
made
an
allocation.
we
say
that
congress
must
have
thought.
they
made
an
allocation
as
otherwise
they
couldn't
have
authorized
two
of
the
states
to
make
a
compact
since
in
so
doing,
they
had
no
right
to
decide
how
much
they
have.
now,
i
expressed
that
awkwardly,
mr.
justice
harlan
but
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
in
substance,
the
congress
had
to
think
that
they
have
divided
the
water
because
otherwise
it
would
have
been
completely
irresponsible
on
the
part
of
congress
to
say
the
two
of
them,
“you
can
divide
between
yourself
this
water
as
you
like.”
now,
let
me
pursue
that
just
a
little
further.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
yes.
i
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
or
obviously,
it
wasn't
intended
that
california
and
nevada
should
get
together
and
cut
out
arizona.
so,
the
congress
must
have
thought
that
we
have
set
apart
to
each
one
of
these
three
states
their
proportionate
share
of
the
water.
and
they
said
in
the
substance,
if
arizona
and
nevada
want
to
get
together
and
raise
the
ceiling
a
little
bit,
fine,
between
themselves.
if
arizona
wants
to
give
nevada
100,000
acres
feet,
fine!
if
nevada
wants
to
give
arizona
100,000
acre-feet
of
the
300,
they
said
that
they
don't
need,
fine!
or
if
arizona,
nevada,
and
california
altogether
and
get
together
and
in
the
interest
of
peace,
settle
these
questions,
fine!
now
let
me
make
one
further
suggestion,
the
other
reasonable
interpretation
is,
that
since
congress
have
said
california
may
not
go
beyond
4.4
million
that
nevada
and
arizona
were
thereby
given
the
authority
from
congress
to
divide
between
themselves,
the
balance
of
the
water
which
would
be
the
3
million
acre-feet
water.
we
say,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
the
congress,
no
one
gets
great
treasure
of
water,
this
thing
that
has
been
fought
over
and,
fought
over,
and
fought
over
for
years
that
this
congress
intended
to
walk
away
and
leave
that
to
the
sole
discretion
of
the
courts
or
the
interstate
compact.
now,
if
i
may
just
turn
briefly
to
section
5
(b).
if
the
court
may
kindly
examine
section
5
after
the
provision
with
respect
to
water
contracts,
you
will
find
what?
you
will
find
that
the
secretary
was
given
detailed
directions
as
to
how
he
should
handle
power.
he
was
told
that
in
the
event
there
was
conflicting
applications,
he
should
have
a
hearing
and
he
was
told
what
policy
he
was
to
apply
in
that
hearing.
he
was
to
apply
the
policy
of
federal
power
act.
now,
can
we
believe
for
one
minute
that
the
congress
intended
to
store
up
this
great
body
of
water,
this
great
treasure
in
the
west
which
is
practically,
as
it
has
been
said
an
amenity
and
not
a
treasure?
can
we
believe
for
one
minute
that
they
intended
to
store
that
water
in
a
great
reservoir
and
then
do
what?
what
was
the
secretary
to
do,
unless
he
was
given
a
direction
to
conform
to
4
(a)?
what
was
he
to
do?
was
he
to
wait
for
the
courts
to
adjudicate
it
by
a
lawsuit?
was
he
to
hold
a
hearing
with
respect
to
the
rights
of
prior
appropriators?
how
was
he
to
do
that
because
congress
gave
him
no
authority
to
hold
a
hearing
with
respect
to
water
rights?
they
did
give
him
the
authority
told
hold
a
hearing
with
respect
to
power
applications.
so
what
is
he
to
do?
wait
another
10-year,
wyoming
versus
colorado,
litigation
period?
how
was
he
to
determine
where
the
waters
to
go
unless
4
(a)
told
him.
and
we
think
that
the
administrative
construction
which
the
secretary
of
the
interior
followed
by
allocating
first
off
in
arizona
2.8
million.
next
allocating
to
california
the
4.4
million
in
the
first
priorities
and
then
allocating
to
nevada
300,000,
implemented
and
carried
out
the
directions
the
congress
gave.
now,
i
would
say
that
again
in
closing,
to
me,
it
is
inconceivable
that
with
a
treasure
far
greater
than
power,
far
greater
than
power,
that
congress
would
have
advocated
its
responsibilities.
that
congress
would
have
shown
this
great
treasure
up
for
grabs.
the
congress
would
have
said
despite
the
fact
that
this
great
treasure
is
needed
and
required,
we're
going
to
store
it
until
what?
until
the
rights
of
prior
appropriators
are
determined
and
how
are
you
going
to
determine
those?
either
by
compact
which
had
failed,
and
failed,
and
failed
or
by
litigation.
and
as
mr.
taylor
said
in
response
to
a
discussion
by
mr.
carter
that
i
read
you
yesterday,
we
have
in
the
upper
basin
litigated
for
25
years
and
with
very
poor
results.
i've
always
thought
that
a
statute
should
be
given
a
reasonable
interpretation
and
in
the
public
interest
and
i
therefore
say,
if
it
please
the
court,
in
our
judgment
at
least,
you
cannot
reconcile
the
notion
of
congress
with
detailed
precision,
spelling
out
how
the
power
was
to
go.
with
detailed
precision,
saying
what
the
secretary
should
do
if
there
was
a
conflict,
and
then
walking
away
from
32
million
stored
acres
of
water
--
acre-feet
of
water,
that
to
me
is
inconceivable.
