stewart
i
don't--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
agricultural
users
in
california
would
use
up
all
of
the
california's
quota?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
million
acre-feet?
justice
potter
stewart
we
understand
they
have
priorities,
but
how
many
acre

million
acre-feet
would
they
use
in
the

justice

yes.

from

justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice

yes.
justice

stewart
where
do
you
get
that
--
where
do
you
get
the

million?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
these
are
not
findings
to
the

justice

3.85
million

by
the
california
agricultural
users.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
metropolitan
water
district
gets
water
from
sources
other
than
the
colorado
river,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
underground
water?
justice
potter
stewart
none?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
this
also
true
of
--
well,
let's
say
water
users
in
los
angeles
and
san
diego,
they
use
--
the
only
water
there
is
colorado
river
water,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
not
supplied
through
the
water
district,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
sierra
water
is
not
to
supplied
through
the
metropolitan
water
district,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
but
then,
so
i
fully
understand
it,
los

and
san
diego
get
water
then
from
sources
other
than
the
metropolitan
water
district,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
agree
wholeheartedly
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
that?
justice

stewart
before

you
said

you
said

1909
is
a
very
important
date.
justice
potter
stewart
before
1914.
justice
potter
stewart
1921?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
all
that
all
adds
up,
but
i
gather
--
get
it
that
the
iii
(d)
in
mexico
requirement
even
at
the
maximum,
as
you
put
it,
most
encouraging
protection,
mean
that
the
upper
basin
can
never
have
seven-and-a
half.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
page,
as
i
gather,
only
gauge
what
goes
through
and
you
have
to
add
the
depletion
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
get
the
virgin
flow.
justice
potter
stewart
the
virgin
flow
is
an
imaginary
figure.
justice
potter
stewart
a
hypothetical?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
with
the
flow
--
what
flow
would've
been
if
nobody
above
had
taken
any
water
out.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
really
hypothetical.
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
suppose
you
have
to
adjust
it.
i
don't
want
to
get
too
complicated
for
the
evaporation.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would've
occurred.
justice
potter
stewart
other
water
that,
in
fact,
was
depleted.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
--
about
ready
to
leave
--
justice
potter
stewart
part
of
this
charge?
justice

well,
i'm

i
may
be
a
bit
confused
but

there,
ii
(a),
the
downstream
requirements
use
--
put
the
7.5
million
there
for
consumptive
use
form
the
mainstream.
your
point
is
that
it's
not
limited
to
the
mainstream.
justice
potter
stewart
this
as
though
accepting
the
master.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
way
is
priority
issue,
one
that
comes
in
the
case
of
--
if
there's
been
a
shortage.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
250,000
mainstream
water?
justice
potter
stewart
this
doesn't
count
the
gila?
justice
potter
stewart
all-american

justice

and
the

this
is

is
this

this

is
the

the
same

of

justice

stewart
so
you're
not
talking

this
isn't

justice

involves
the

justice
potter
stewart
what

was
there
any

ever
in

in
saying
that
the

i
thought
that

it's
something
else?
justice

but
then
--
if
we
didn't
so
define
it,
wyoming
wouldn't
be

it?

it

justice

is
that

that's
what
the

says
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
you
say.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
unanimity
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
if
arizona's
destruction
of
the
meaning
of
the

were
adapted,
then
that
would've
adversely
the
effect
of
the
upper

justice

of

--
justice

of

they

justice

yes.

yes.
justice

well,
but
congress

if
the

what
would
be
the
point
of

any

justice

i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
--
i
just
didn't
follow
that.
withdrawn
in
what
sense?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
what
you're
saying
is
that
of
the
lands
owned
by
the
government
in
arizona,
75%
have
been
withdrawn
--
justice
potter
stewart
from
any
possibility
of
private
acquisition?
justice
potter
stewart
dedicated
again.
justice
potter
stewart
the
navy
is
going
to
need
at
least
that
much
water.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
do
that,
i
--
enlighten
my
ignorance.
by
“a
public
land
state,”
you
mean
a
state
where
there
are
any
public
lands
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
are
they
public
land
states?
justice
potter
stewart
before
they
were
a
state?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
your
term
of
reference.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
so.
justice
potter
stewart
do
we
have
such
a
map
in
our
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
any
--
attached
in
any
of
the
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
in
here?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
certain
where
the
government
number
appears
on
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
actually
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
still
a
school?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
does
require
quite
a
good
deal
of
capital
expenditure
to
irrigate
efficiently.
justice
potter
stewart
this
congress
could
--
by
legislation
could
recommit
anything
that
this
court
had
found
here.
justice
potter
stewart
while
we
are
at
a
little
bit
off
field
here,
could
you
answer
this
question?
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
master's
report,
the
various
federal
reservations
or
photos
are
taken
away
from
the
state
appropriations
or
photos.
now,
arizona
no
longer
has
any
quarrel
with
that
basic
system,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
state.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
originally
some
difference
of
opinion
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
it
comes
out
of
the
state's
allocation,
--
justice
potter
stewart
appropriation,
or
entitlement.
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
rest
of
arizona.
justice
potter

2,000,000
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
2,000,000
in
the
gila
plus
the
bill
williams

justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
is
a
matter
of
definition
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
is
not

justice

stewart
and
you
--
justice

i
understood
your

just
disagree
with
arizona's

justice

justice
potter

well,
arizona,
how
much

arizona

california

get

in

it

be

that
the
dedication
of
the

was
a

was
a
charged
against
but
the
arizona

otherwise
have
gotten

if
these
--
justice

--
these
figures
rather.
justice

well,
that
would
be

indicate
that
perhaps
that
3
(d)
in
mind
rather
that
it's
3

justice
potter
stewart
but
physically,
just
a
matter
of
physical
facts
that
you
are
not
correlative,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
additional
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
additional
tributaries.
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
by
state
law?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
about
relative
priorities
within
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
given
state.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
leave
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
california
contracts
are
of
course
made
directly
with
users,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
arizona
contracts.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
to
users
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
what
you're
saying.
how
could
these
--
what
kind
of
a
controversy
would
this
be?
it
would
--
there's
no
such
controversy
before
the
master
here,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
shortage
of
water.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i'd
understood
that
in
--
within
california,
within
the
state
of
the
people
you
represent
that
it
all
have
been
worked
out
as
a
matter
of
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
so
there'd
be
no
controversies
there,
would
there?
justice
potter
stewart
these
two
users
would
now
be
in
two
different
states,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
--
what
was
its
effect?
what
was
the
effect
of
making
you
subject
to
the
compact
in
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
the
consumptive
uses
above
the
dam
from
the
main
stream
or
from
the
main
stream
of
the
tributaries
between
lee
ferry
and
the

justice
potter
stewart
which?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
section
between
lee
ferry
and
lake
mead?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
six
million
to
6
and-a-half
million
acre-feet
in
what
--
in
what
body
of
--
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
main
stream
from
the
lake
mead
down
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
you
say
that
arizona
presently
is
using
how
much
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
lee
ferry
to
mexico.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
then
of
that
6
million,
arizona
is
now
using
how
much?
justice
potter
stewart
a
million?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
then
in
addition,
arizona
so
far
--
is
getting
the
--
use
of
the
gila,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
an
additional.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
the
--
is
this
the
area
of
what,
north
of
phoenix?
justice

stewart
if
the

it's
the

that
protects
the

against

i

i

did
i
in

justice

isn't
that
it?
justice

i

justice

and
you
do
find
the

permanent
service?
justice
potter
stewart
and
except
under
con
--
by
contract.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
california
proposal
is
a
little
inaccurate.
this
california
proposal
double
barreled.
justice
potter
stewart
out
of
the
mainstream
--
justice
potter
stewart
california,
of
course,
says
that
we
have
to
consider
all
tributaries
too.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
proceed,
you're
basing
your
position
that
this
is
a
justiciable
controversy
before
us,
exclusively
upon
these
facts
that
there
is
not
enough
water
to
go
around.
i
take
it
that
you
concede
that
if
there's
not
enough
water
to
go
around,
we
will
not
have
a
justiciable
controversy.
justice
potter
stewart
because
what
i
understood
the
arizona
position
was
that
there
was
enough
water
to
go
around.
justice
potter
stewart
what?
aren't
you
talking
about
the
first
million
of
the
surplus?
justice
potter
stewart
part
of
gila
was
in
new
mexico.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
would
count.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
order
to
really
preserve
that
fundamental
condition,
wouldn't
it,
provisions
has
to
be
made
in
the
contract
involving
withdrawal
of
water
from
--
by
nevada
for
example,
muddy
river
and
meadow
valley
and
by
arizona
from
the
little
colorado
river
and
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
huh?
justice
potter
stewart
comes
in
to
lake
mead,
i
thought.
it
comes
in
to
colorado
which
comes
in
to
lake
mead.
it
may
not
--
maybe
this
river
flows
in
the
opposite
direction.
justice
potter
stewart
and
nevada,
as
i
look
at
the
map,
can't
get
any

justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
can't
get
any
water
directly
from
the
colorado

without
going
to
arizona.
justice
potter
stewart
in
to
lake
mead.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
not
sure.
justice
potter
stewart
the
contracts
by
the
secretary
where
the
states

nevada

with
various
metropolitan

other

stewart

california
and
not

the

with

of

justice
potter
stewart
and
with
the
state
of
nevada.
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
with
the
state
of
california.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
putting
to
one
side
the
language
about
present
perfected
use.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
those
aren't
in
issue
here,
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
word
--
in
a
word,
your
position
is
that
all
of
these
add
up
to
giving
the
secretary
absolute
and
unfettered
discretion
as
to
whom
he
will
make

with
within
the
state
limitations
except
for
present

which
he

is
that
it?

these
were,

use
to
converge
and
then
the
converged
stream
flow
into
the
colorado.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
say
there
is
maximum
appropriation
so
there
was
very
little
flow
at
all
into
the
colorado
river.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
parry,
you
would
agree
that
in
case
of
shortage,
nevada's
300,000
would
have
to
be
reduced
by
what
370
feet
of
the
shortage?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
that's
more
like
it,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
one
other
question
so
i'm
sure
i
understand
you.
your
position
is
that
you're
entitled
to
300,000
acre-feet
subject
to
this
possibility
of
reduction
that
we've
just
talked
about
out
of
lake
mead
plus
some
50,000
acre-feet
out
of
the
tributaries.
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
all
perfected
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
i
understand
that
the
master
deducted
those
from
your
300,000,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
did
not.
