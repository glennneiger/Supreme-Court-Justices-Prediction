justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
2
million
acre-feet
from
the
tributaries
being
used
or
is
that
just
its
production?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
understand.
if
7.5
million
feet
must,
in
all
events,
be
sleuths
through
at
lee
ferry,
then
why
doesn't
that
amount
of
water
reach
lake
mead?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
how
can
that
be
a
question
in
this
case
because
it
depends
upon
how
much
water
there
will
actually
be
and
nobody
knows
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
as
i
understand
you,
mr.
ely,
does
it
come
down
to
this?
your
claim
is
that
arizona
should
be
charged
with
the
water
that
it
may
remove
from
the
colorado
river
between
lee
ferry
and
lake
mead.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
else?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
i
understood
--
i
intended
to
say
from
the
colorado
river
including
its
tributary
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
the
system
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
between
lee
ferry
and
lake
mead,
is
that
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
see.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
were
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
there
about
50,000
acre-feet
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
ely,
may
i
check
a
few
figures?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
perhaps
you
could
answer
this
in
the
original
argument.
in
relation
to
what
you're
talking
about
now,
do
i
understand
correctly
the
following
that
right
now
california
is
using
--
for
existing
uses
5,362,000
acres
of
water,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
arizona
about
1,200,000?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
about
a
120,000?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now
the
central
arizona
project,
is
it
contemplated
that
this
would
have
about
1,200,000?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
if
we
were
to
apply
the
pro
rata
basis
of
the
master,
assuming
the
loss
of
about
600,000.
i'm
using
the
example
i
think
you'll
use
in
some
as
a
material
that's
before
us.
would
it
be
correct
that
california
would
then
be
diminished
to
about
4
million
acre-feet?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
if
you
took
my
example
just
as
an
example.
i'm
trying
to
work
out
the
differences
between
the
priority
and
the
pro
rata
basis.
if
it
were
assumed
that
the
supply
--
the
loss
was
600,000
applying
the
pro
rata
adjustment
from
the
master,
i
think
it's
correct
that
it
comes
to
about
4
million.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
no.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
would
be
there
--
the
difference
therefore
be,
assuming
this
same
posture
but
--
that
if
the
priority
basis
was
used,
the
basis
you
are
arguing
for
that
you
would
continue
to
get
about
your
400
--
4,400,000
but
that
arizona
would
then
bear
the
entire
600,000
shortage?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
assuming
nevada
got
the
300,000
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
this
the
assumption
of
the
master
that
there
would
be
no
deduction
for
the
diversion
above
the
dam?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
would
that
--
how
would
that
be
changed
if
there
were
deduction
for
the
diversion
above
the
dam?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
assuming
that
the
master
was
wrong
in
that
aspect
of
the
case,
so
the
diversions
above
the
dam
were
charged
to
arizona,
how
would
--
would
you
mind
spelling
out
again
how
that
would
affect
the
hypothetical
example
used
by
the
master?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
dam?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
isn't
he
applying
section
6
of
the
project
act
in
so
doing?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
am
i
wrong
that
at
the
present
time
about
6,500,000
acre-feet
is
being
used
currently?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
assuming
that
example
that
you
--
the
master
was
dealing
with
to
which
the
loss
is
down
to
6
million,
applying
your
priority
to
the
argument.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
then
would
happen?
what
would
california
get
and
what
would
arizona
get
with
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
of
this
six
million
in
nevada?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
except
that
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
then
embark
upon
the
central
arizona
project.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
would
be
excluded.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
arizona
could
not
proceed
with
the
arizona
project
unless
there
were
a
determination
here.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
then
you
believe
they
would
be
foolish
to
do
it
because
you
don't
think
that
that
water
supply
is
available?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(voice
overlap)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
or
perhaps
the
(inaudible)
but
then
would
you
not
tell
me
why
if
that
is
so,
you
are
using
what's
happened
to
the
500,000
that
you
are
now
using?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
--
as
i
understood
it,
you
are
using
6,500,000
acres
presently
out
of
the
supply
at
lake
mead
and
you
are
now
saying,
as
i
further
understood
you,
you
say
you
believe
that
what
is
really
available
is
only
6,000,000
acre-feet.
what
has
happened
to
the
other
500,000
acre-feet?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
this
is
an
authorization.
this
doesn't
mean
that
the
depletion
is
now
taking
place
at
this
rate.

did

wasn't
at
that

that
this

justice
arthur

really,
aren't
you
in
fact
arguing
then
that
that
ought
to
be
wasted?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
outside
of
the
question
of
whatever
grievances
you
might
have
against
california,
what
harm
would
come
to
arizona
from
the
master's
interpretation
of
the
statute
permitting
water
which
might
otherwise
be
wasted
to
go
to
california,
would
arizona
be
harmed?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(voice

--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
practically
if
it
has
no
current
use
for
the
water?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
it
a
far
reaching
interpretation
of
the
act
to
say
that
congress
not
also
wanting
water
to
be
wasted
intended
that
this
should
be
governed?
this
maximum
limitation
provided
no
one
else
was
prejudiced
by
the
excess
going
over,
would
that
be
a
strained
construction
(voice

justice
arthur

are
you
in
a
position
to
raise
that
question
if
you're
not
injured?
justice
arthur
j.

well,
what
you're
saying
is
--
justice

is
obvious
that
where
it
could
rather
depend
on
arizona
and

mr.

how
much

and
how

distributed

what
is
