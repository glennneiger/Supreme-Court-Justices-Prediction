mr.
r.
p.
parry
--
the
validity
--
upon
the
validity
of
this
contract
was
asserted.
i
had
some
discussion
with
solicitor
general
during
the
recess
and
if
i
could
state
it
correctly,
it
is
still
the
united
states'
position
that
the
contract,
not
that
the
contract
is
invalid
but
that
it
must
be
implemented
by
independent
contracts.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
precisely
that
--
i
think
that
is
rather
the
fundamental
leverage
between
united
states
and
state
of
nevada.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
think
the
state
of
the
record
is
this.
the
master
recommends
that
the
contract
stay
as
it
is.
that's
the
report
now.
and
if
--
if
affirmed,
that's
the
way
it
would
stand.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
pardon
me.
as
the
master's
final
report
now
stands
and
he
recommends
that
the
nevada
contract
stand
as
it
is.
the
government
accepted
to
that
point.
if
the
master
report
were
affirmed,
the
contract
would
stand
the
way
it
is
and
nevada
would
be
the
party
who
would
receive
the
water,
would
pay
for
it
and
would
make
the
distribution
among
the
various
people
in
the
area.
and
i
might
add
there's
been
disinteresting
developed
through
in
the
congress,
one
of
the
--
a
valley
that
adjoins
the
las
vegas
valley
is
the
el
dorado
valley
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
passed
legislation
authorizing
the
state
of
nevada
to
take
115,000
acres
of
land
over
in
that
valley
at
an
appraised
price
which,
i'm
pointing,
which
this
water
will
be
used
for
people
living
on
that
land,
all
the
sides.
and
also
another
separate
act
of
congress
for
a
similar
handling
of
15,000
of
ac
--
acres
down
near
the
mohave
indian
reservation
and
then
the
state
of
nevada
working
list,
the
department
of
interior
in
the
last
appropriation
got
tons
for
a
study
for
putting
this
water
on
there.
so,
it's
a
partnership
operation
between
the
state
as
such
and
the
--
and
the
federal
government
and
it
is
our
taking
not
to
belabor
the
point
that,
as
i
said
earlier,
there's
no
difference
say
between
the
state
of
nevada
and
--
and
any
irrigation
district
of
the
state
might
be
--
might
create
nor
is
there
any
difference
say
between
the
state
of
nevada
and
the
metropolitan
water
district.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
think
so.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
no,
i
think
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
as
i
say
the
congress
has
already
authorized
the
latter
to
be
--
become
a
little
like
north
to
go
to
(inaudible)
and
takeover
this
land.
and
if
they
takeover
the
land
and
people
who
live
on
it,
they
will
have
to
give
them
water
downtown
to
drink
and
to
use.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
think
so
as
it
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
as
there
as
--
as
the
record
now
stands.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
read
so
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
no.
they
--
this
--
the
history
of
it,
the
--
the
industrial
user
originally
was
the
united
states
of
america
or
an
agency
on
that.
in
other
words,
i
mentioned
during
the
war
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
--
that
those
big
magnesium
complex
there
and
a
part
of
this,
neva
--
and
nevada
water
went
to
that
industry.
that's
what
made
it
possible.
and
now
as
it's
divided
up
around
and
i
think
i'm
correct
to
say,
none
of
those
have
a
direct
contract
with
the
united
states
but
it's
all
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
they
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
they
could
have
and
i
think,
perhaps,
even
prevent
them.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
so
far
as
this
has
been
a
purely
academic
argument
that
is
typical
or
less
but
just
been
going
head
out
there.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
suppose.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
suppo
--
i
--
i
think
that
is
a
good
speech
of
(inaudible)
and
i
want
to
find
out
about
it
if
you
could
have
another
lawsuit
or
that
way.
the
final
point
that
we
wish
to
discuss
a
little
bit
is
another
point
where
the
controversies
between
the
united
states
and
nevada
and
that
is
a
provision
that
nevada's
300,000
acre-feet
shall
include
all
other
users
in
the
state.
now,
as
i
mentioned
in
the
beginning
of
my
comments
and
the
support
--
the
old
settle
area
in
the
northwestern
part
of
the
state,
just
north
and
west
of
the
reservoir
along
the
virgin
river
and
the
muddy
river,
has
a
consumptive
use.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
difference
between
the
diversions
and
the
term
clauses
estimated
to
be
approximately
50,000
acre-feet.
as
the
united
states
interprets
this
nevada
contract,
nevada
is
not
going
to
get
this
300,000
acre-feet
but
it's
going
to
get
300,000
less
this
50,000
and
it
become
so
--
we
--
become
250,000
less
the
300.
it
has
been
--
i
think
it
was
commented
on
by
the
solicitor
general
and
others
if
there
was
one
thing
that
was
consistent
all
through
the
discussion
of
this
project
act,
setting
up
the
project
was
that
nevada
had
said
they
would
limit
their
demands
to
300,000
in
order
to
have
300,000.
and
now,
we
find
that
in
one
paragraph
of
the
--
the
secretary
drew,
they
--
there
is
--
this
language
which
reduces
the
300,000
by
uses
that
existed
there
before
the
reservoir
was
ever
dreamed
of.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
and
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
that's
--
that
is
--
that
is
not,
perhaps,
the
more
accurate
way
of
stating
it.
now,
there
seems
to
us
have
no
reason
to
--
in
the
world
that
--
however
you
analyze
that
penalizes
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
from
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
--
from
the
--
from
springs
mainly.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
springs
that
feed
into
the
muddy
river
and
the
virgin
river,
two
small
streams
out
there.
in
other
words,
the
sta
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
and
that
solely
from
the
tributaries,
their
whole
uses,
they
were
there
before
the
comeback
and
the
stream
and
other
were
there
before
the
project
was
conceived
and
the
master
entered
into
quite
an
extensive
discussion
of
the
reasons
for
it.
i'm
not
attempt
to
take
the
time
now
to
repeat
it
and
he
found
that
that
was
not
a
correct
exercise
of
the
secretary's
power
in
putting
that
language
in
which
resulted
in
that
diminution
of
the
--
of
nevada's
rights.
in
other
words,
under
their
report,
again
as
it
--
the
final
report
as
he
has
filed
it,
that
portion
of
the
nevada
--
of
the
nevada
contract
is
deleted
so
that
the
three
full
300,000
is
that
nevada's
contribution
or
nevada's
right
in
the
storage
in
the
reservoir.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
now
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
think
quite
similar
except
that
ours
happens
to
be
geographically
located
above
the
reservoir.
now,
the
gila's
belong
entirely
with
them.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
they're
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
i
think.
thank
you.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
(inaudible)
speak
of
having
this
small
area
here
(inaudible)
is
the
muddy
river
that
comes
down
to
northwest
very
small
stream
begins
as
some
large
springs.
there
is
enough
natural
rain
flow
that
creates
stream
but
there's
some
springs
there
and
have
water
taken
off
irrigation
land,
that
adjoin
the
upper
end
of
the
reservoir
where
the
--
the
muddy
--
the
meadow
valley
washed
come
down
to
the
north
and
the
virgin
river
that
heads
in
utah
just
about
the
corner.
there's
some
diversions
of
(inaudible)
that
river,
i
think
all
over
the
state
line
and
bring
some
water
around
for
irrigation.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
originally
the
muddy
river
flowed
in
to
the
virgin
and
the
flat
nature
of
the
land
there
has
well
indicated
by
the
back
--
that's
where
the
water
backs
up
the
reservoir,
that's
why
the
reservoir
was
there.
and
there
was
this
flat
land,
that
these
pioneers
could
irrigate.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
we
might
be
talking
about
present
perfected
rights.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
if
they're
(inaudible)
mr.
r.
p.
parry
its
a
present
perfected
right
in
every,
not
any
--
every
variety
of
definition
i
can
think
of.
and
now,
the
reason
that
it
was
given
for
not
allowing
it
is
that
it
diminishes
the
water
in
the
reservoir.
if
you
follow
that
theory
you
would
go
clear
to
the
head
waters
of
the
reservoir
and
penala
--
of
the
river
system
and
penalize
everyone
and
i
think
no
one
has
any
thought
that
that
should
be
done.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
from
the
beginning
of
this
action
we
have
and
it
was
due
to
nevada's
request
that
the
master
rule
as
it
then
was
briefed
and
presented
to
him
fully.
it's
discussed
at
length
in
his
report
better
than
i
can
do
it
here.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
that
was
one
of
the
--
nevada's
request,
your
honor.
and
it
has
been
our
thinking
that
the
secretary
is
in
the
river
in
so
many
different
capacities
for
proprietary
with
respect
to
the
indians,
with
respect
to
power,
with
respect
to
various
federal
projects
that
the
type
of
anglo-saxon
justice
that
we
at
least
try
for
would,
perhaps,
be
better
satisfied
if
there
was
an
independent
commissioner
there
operating
under
specific
rules
and
regulations.
so
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
of
favoritism
or
and
that
everyone
would
be
treated
alike.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
the
first
thing
would
be
the
accurate
compilation
of
the
water
available
for
that
division
among
these
contracts
annually
and
fair
enough
it
advance
so
that
the
users
could
plan
their
use.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes
--
yes,
and
what
a
real
water
master
has
all
the
varieties
of
duties
that
a
water
master
should
have.
and
i
think
that
there
will
be
grave
questions
as
a
policy
to
be
determined,
probably,
of
how
much
should
be
safely
discharged
from
this
reservoir
prorated
among
the
contracts.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
think
it
is
of
a
highest
potential
in
that
way.
that's
been
the
history.
if
there's
anything
in
the
west
that
people
fight
over
is
water.
perhaps,
this
litigation
is
a
good
evidence
of
it.
and
it's
our
desire
and
thinking
and
i
believe
california
has
agreed
with
us
on
that.
that
an
independent
commissioner,
probably,
with
an
advisory
board
representing
the
states
who
could
participate
in
and
advising
even
ahead
of
time,
would
remove
much
incipient
friction
and
perhaps
prevent
hearings
coming
back
to
this
court.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
believe
he
could.
and
i
believe
that's
one
of
the
suggestions
that
--
that
has
been
thrown
into
the
record.
but
again,
we
have
thought
that
it's
a
--
someone
was
in
there
which
it
was
a
kind
of
judicial
capacity.
this
is
of
such
great
importance
to
all
of
this
vast
area
for
water
is
so
tremendously
needed
that
it
seems
to
me
--
seems
to
us,
a
logical
way
of
handling
it.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
do
not
know
that
it
has
been
put
up
to
the
congress.
now,
you
see
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
i
would
think
that
the
court,
in
the
usual
practice
in
such
cases
of
this,
has
probably
going
to
reserve
some
type
of
jurisdiction,
it's
put
at
the
decree
and
that
the
court
would
re-divest
in
the
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
--
most
efficient
way
of
doing
it.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
it
does.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
and
that
--
and
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
your
honor.
the
continuing
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
i
think
is
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
i
think
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
i
think
so,
(inaudible)
the
waters
or
something.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
pardon
me?
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
your
honor,
they
are
permanent.
and
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
believe,
that's
my
memory,
justice
douglas,
if
that
was
a
permanent
one
thereto.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
one
quite
interesting
aspect
of
the
california
argument
and
that
is
that
when
you
add
up
the
water
supply
available,
you
count
in
the
tributaries.
but
when
you
go
to
looking
for
existing
projects,
then
the
tributaries
become
step
children
in
the
not
existing
projects.
matter
of
the
fact
is
that
the
simple
arizona
project
as
proposed
is
not
a
new
project.
it
is
a
project
designed
to
save
an
existing
project
in
the
lower
basin.
so
that
when
california
talks
about
existing
projects,
if
she
wants
to
include
the
tributaries,
she
should
--
in
like
fashion
of
fairness
include
the
existing
projects
on
those
tributaries.
we
had
not
intended,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
dwell
at
length
on
the
apparent
question
of
shortage
or
water
supply
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
matter
has
been
discussed
at
some
length
by
california,
we
have
asked
the
clerk
to
pass
around
four
little
tables
which
we
prepared,
which
we
think
pretty
quickly
and
decisively
explode
this
notion
that
there
is
potentially
a
great
shortage
in
california.
the
first
of
these
and
these
are
taken
with
one
exception
from
california
exhibits,
shows
the
actual
requirements
of
existing
projects,
accepting
california's
own
figures
as
to
what
she
can
save
in
the
way
of
water
in
the
future.
we
find
that
in
the
first
column.
in
her
existing
projects,
she
jumps
her
present
uses
from
67,900
to
100,500
acres
or
net
jump
of
new
acreage
which
she
proposes
to
irrigate
in
which
she
said
she
needs
water
for
and
that
that
she
classifies
as
an
existing
project.
we
find
that
in
the
second
column,
the
res
--
of
the
reservation
division,
the
yuma
project.
she
jumps
from
10,800
acre-feet,
now
in
use,
waters
now
being
supplied
to
it,
to
20,100
acre-feet.
and
we
find
that
in
the
imperial
irrigation
district,
she
jumps
from
495,800
acres
presently
irrigated
and
this
is
the
average,
average
acreage
irrigated
from
her
own
exhibits,
the
last
five
years
before
the
end
of
the
trial
--
of
the
last
five
years
before
1955,
a
total
of
165,200
acres.
she
comes
here
solemnly
and
tells
you
that
this
water
is
for
existing
projects.
this
water
is
not
for
existing
projects.
this
water
is
to
expand
projects
far
beyond
the
economic
boundaries
of
which
they
justify
with
respect
for
instance
to
the
all-american
canal,
the,
the
enlargement
of
the
165,000
acres.
the
testimony
of
that
was
such
that
the
master
said,
you
take
a
little
water
and
add
some
sand
to
it
in
the
stand
point
of
being
irrigable
acreages.
so
we
say,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
when
california
tells
you
that
she
is
here
asking
for
water
for
existing
projects,
asking
you
to
let
the
water
table
in
central
arizona
continue
to
fall
and
fall
and
fall,
and
50,000
acres
of
land,
a
lot
of
water
each
year,
let
us
however
put
in
an
additional
211,600
acres
much
of
which
is
very
marginal
land.
the
last
column,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
the
--
the
water
requirements
which
california
herself
said
she
could
get
by
with,
applied
to
the
existing
acreages,
applied
to
the
lands
now
in
cultivation
and
which
she
says
she
wants
preserved,
which
shows
that
she
can
get
by
giving
metropolitan
water
district
a
total
of
584,000
acre-feet
a
year
with
3,587,900
acre-feet.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
only
purpose
of
this
because
we
do
not
deem
water
supply
relevant
is
because
california
has
sought
and
have
seen
fit
to
come
before
this
court
and
apparently
setup
a
great
trial
[inaudible]
with
respect
to
shortage,
which
in
fact
does
not
exist
if
california
will
take
care
of
the
water
she
presently
has.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
will
--
i
will
answer
that
directly.
the
master
found
if
it
please
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
members
of
the
court,
after
the
argument
in
new
york,
when
california
advanced
the
same
great
horror
of
shortage,
of
eminent
peril
of
all
these
things
that
are
going
to
happen,
of
dire
consequence
to
california,
the
master
rewrote
his
draft
before
it
and
he
added
a
footnote
at
the
--
one
portion
there
which
he
said
this,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
--
i
believe
it's
103,
i'll
get
the
reference
for
you
in
just
a
moment,
“the
supply
of
available
water
in
the
california
river
has
in
the
past
been
substantially
larger
than
the
demand
for
it.”
in
short,
every
project
received
all
the
water
it
requested.
in
such
circumstances,
it's
not
surprising
that
a
great
deal
of
water
has
been
wasted
as
is
apparent
for
example
from
the
very
large
unused
runoff
each
year
into
the
salton
sea.
undoubtedly,
[inaudible]
becomes
scarce
in
this
area,
it
used
to
be
regulated
much
more
efficiently
than
at
present.
it
appears
that
such
practices
in
landing
canals,
evaporating
--
reducing
over
ordering
of
water,
reusing
runoff
water,
reducing
evaporation,
and
improving
channels
can
be
instituted
in
the
future
and
will
effect
a
substantial
reduction
in
the
amount
of
water
needed
to
supply
existing
california
needs.
it
is
impossible
to
determine
exactly
how
much
more
efficiently
water
will
be
used
in
the
present
--
at
the
present
condition
of
abundance
turned
in
water
shortage.
but
it
is
clear
that
savings
will
be
such
that
california's
existing
uses
to
be
satisfied
by
substantially
less
water
than
is
presently
diverted.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
at
the
conclusion
of
our
argument
last
time,
we
showed
to
the
court
pictures,
colored
pictures
of
two
rivers,
two
rivers
running
out
of
the
imperial
irrigation
district
into
salton
sea,
either
of
which
are
a
larger
than
the
influent
of
the
salt
river
valley
in
our
irrigation
canals.
mr.
ely
tells
you
at
the
end
of
the
rebuttal
when
it's
no
longer
possible
for
us
to
reply
that
that
was
sewage.
well,
it
isn't
sewage,
about
80%
of
it
is
good
usable
water
and
about
20%
of
it
is
drain
water.
so
we
say
and
the
master
found
that
california
in
the
imperial
district
is
wasting,
is
wasting
a
very
substantial
amount
of
water,
something
over
a
million
acre-feet
a
year
into
the
salton
sea.
so
that
when
she
comes
here
and
cries
shortage
to
you,
she
should
advise
you
that
that
shortage
is
in
large
part
to
be
caused
by
her
own
inattention
to
reasonable
conservation
practices.
now,
the
next
exhibit
which
is
now
the
little
form
to
which
i
handed
you
is
not
intended
as
other
than
a
reconnaissance
study,
may
i
say.
you'll
note
the
title
of
it
indicated,
california
agricultural
needs
giving
effect
to
reasonable
conservation
practices.
during
the
course
of
preparation
for
the
trial,
arizona
sampled
the
drains
in
the
imperial
irrigation
district
and
sampled
the
runoff
water
over
an
extensive
period
of
time.
and
by
chemical
analysis
demonstrated
that
about
20%-21%
of
that
was
actual
drain
water,
the
other
was
water
run
over
the
top
of
the
fields
and
which
went
to
waste
in
the
salton
sea.
one
reason
for
it,
california
runs
this
water
through
the
canals
and
generates
electricity,
and
there's
no
reason
why
she
shouldn't
run
that
water,
when
it's
ample,
we
have
no
complaint
with
that.
arizona
waste
water
too,
we
think
in
the
yuma
area,
we
have
no
problem
with
that
because
there's
lots
of
water
now.
but
what
we
do
say
is
that
california
should
not
come
here
with
a
straight
face
then
tell
this
court
that
she
needs
that
water
when
the
master
has
found
she's
wasting
it.
now
the
purpose
of
this
next
exhibit
is
simply
to
indicate
and
no
more;
arizona
conducted
a
series
of
studies
with
respect
to
lining
the
canals
in
the
imperial
and
coachella
works.
in
other
words,
the
amount
of
seepage,
she
recovers
nothing
from
her
ground
water
at
all
and
what
could
be
done
in
the
way
of
lining
these
canals,
what
could
be
done
with
the
way
of
recovery
of
ground
water,
what
could
be
done
with
the
way
of
--
in
a
way
of
usual,
normal
conservation
practices
when
water
is
scarce.
and
we
came
up
with
the
determination
and
we
assert
it
is
a
conservative
determination
that
our
total
--
total
agricultural
needs
could
be
satisfied
with
2,437,700
acre-feet
that
is
by
saving
water
that
is
now
being
wasted.
they
tell
me
the
salton
sea
has
turned
into
a
wonderful,
wonderful
resort
but
we're
just
a
little
reluctant
to
have
our
waters
used
for
the
purpose
of
fishing
in
california
or
people
going
swimming
and
sail
boating.
we
think
we
can
put
it
to
better
use
in
arizona
where
it
belongs.
we
agree,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
up
to
this
point,
the
issue
of
other
sources
to
california
was
probably
not
relevant.
the
master
so
held.
however,
california
has
seem
to
tell
--
seem
fit
to
tell
this
court
that
metropolitan
is
going
to
go
thirsty,
they're
going
to
run
out
of
water
there
if
something
isn't
done
by
this
court
to
preserve
their
great
--
state
of
california.
well
now,
let's
just
look
at
the
facts.
from
her
own
testimony,
from
her
own
witness,
it
developed
that
metropolitan
had
a
population
of
7,329,012
people
that
includes
san
diego
and
the
whole
area.
her
present
sources
of
supply,
1,220,000
acre-feet
which
by
her
own
testimony
is
to
how
much
she
needed
per
person
would
be
adequate
for
a
population
of
seven
million,
6,700,000.
that's
wholly
a
part
from
any
water
from
the
colorado
river.
there
also
was
filed
with
our
opening
brief
a
certified
copy
of
the
contract
between
the
metropolitan
water
district
and
the
state
of
california
for
federal
river
water
which
provides
that
by
1970,
they
will
be
delivered
110,000
acre-feet
for
the
metropolitan
water
district,
and
by
1990,
there
will
be
a
1,500,000
acre-feet
available
or
a
total
of
2,720,000
acre-feet,
forgetting
about
the
colorado
river,
2,720,000
acre-feet
which
is
adequate
for
a
population
of
over
17
million.
and
if
you
give
to
them
the
five
hundred
and
some
thousand
acre-feet,
we
suggest
that
over
yonder
they
have
a
--
a
total
supply
by
1990
of
3,304,000
acre-feet
which
is
adequate
for
a
population
of
18
million,
18
million
souls
on
her
own
basis
of
what
it
takes
to
supply
a
person
with
water.
now,
when
she
comes
here
and
tells
you
and
would
have
you
believe
that
people
in
california
are
going
to
go
without
water,
she
simply
is
wanting
to
play
the
game
both
ways.
one
point
is
wholly
irrelevant
whether
it
comes
to
appealing
to
the
sympathy
of
this
court
that
then
becomes
a
very
material
fact.
that
is
a
reason
for
these
exhibits.
that
is
the
only
reason
for
them.
the
final
one
is
the
arizona
picture,
the
arizona
picture.
it
involves
the
major
agricultural
and
residential
areas
in
central
arizona.
from
1940
to
1956,
the
ground
water
fell
in
the
salt
river
valley
area
74
and
three-tenths
feet.
in
the
grassy
grant
fort
area
70
feet,
in
the
[inaudible]
steinfield
area
95
and
five-tenths
feet
and
in
the
illinois
area
104,000
--
104
acre-feet
for
a
total
average
of
--
as
the
chart
shows,
80
feet.
now
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
this
is
what
would
be
termed,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
major
central
arizona
area.
it
involves
all
the
major
agricultural
area
in
central
arizona
which
is
largely
the
major
agricultural
area.
it
involves
the
major
cities
of
central
arizona,
the
only
large
city
would
be
tucson
which
is
not
included.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
no,
no,
your
honor,
of
course
not.
i'm
simply
saying
that
if
someone
can
come
in
here
and
cry
a
poor
mouth,
we'll
cry
a
poor
mouth
with
him
in
a
lot
--
a
lot
louder
voice
too.
because
we
really
do
have
something
that
is
hurting
whereas
the
shortage
they
talk
about
in
california
is
something
far,
so
far
on
the
distance,
that
a
man
with
an
ordinary
telescope
couldn't
see
it.
that's
what
the
master
found.
in
the
hearings
that
authorized
the
upper
basin
colorado
river
project,
these
projects
that
mr.
ely
is
now
talking
about
were
also
part
of
the
testimony
before
those
hearings.
and
the
total
ultimate
diversion
contemplated
by
all
of
those
projects
was
400
--
4,880,400
--
40
--
four
million
and
eight
hundred
and
some
thousand
acre-feet.
in
other
words,
under
the
testimony
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation
itself,
75
to
a
hundred
years
from
now
is
going
to
be
required
to
deplete
the
upper
basin
water
supply
down
to
4,800,000.
so
that
as
the
master
said
for
the
foreseeable
future,
it's
impossible
to
conceive
--
conceive
there's
going
to
be
any
shortage.
in
that
respect,
he
noted
the
fact
that
every
hydrologist
assumed
the
depletion
in
the
upper
basin
of
6,500,000
to
6,800,000.
in
other
words,
on
top
of
these
fancy
figures
that
california
has
given
you,
there's
another
million
and
a
half
for
the
next
75
to
100
years
and
probably
beyond
that.
now
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
no,
your
honor.
i
suppose
i
should
say
as
mr.
justice
black
indicated
that
making
the
jury
argument
in
that
we
have
understood
from
california's
publicity
and
from
their
statements
here
that
for
some
reason
they're
in
terrible
peril.
i
don't
--
i
am
not
digressing
that
to
that
--
the
point
at
this
moment.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
we
do
not
think
the
water
supply
is
--
is
involved
your
honor.
we
agree
with
the
master
that
this
is
a
case
where
congress
has
put
its
powerful
hands
down
upon
the
river
in
the
exercise
of
the
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
water
supply?
mr.
r.
p.
parry
water
supply?
mr.
r.
p.
parry
we
are
satisfied,
your
honor
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
federal
apportionment
must
be
decided.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
and
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
if
that
--
that
depends
with
--
if
it
please
the
court,
upon
how
you
interpret
the
project
act.
as
we
read
the
project
act,
california
says
it
preserved
priority
and
principles
of
priority
and
so
on.
we
say
it
does
not.
so,
i
suppose
inherent
in
my
saying
that
you
must
determine
the
question
of
federal
allocation,
you
must
also
then
determine
whether
or
not
in
that
allocation
respect
has
been
maintained
for
priority,
rights
of
--
appropriate
and
so
on.
but
we
--
we
are
firmly
convinced
that
the
master
is
right.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
and
--
and
feel
that
we
can
demonstrate
that,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
bring
one
other
attention
to
the
--
as
your
honors
and
then
i'm
going
to
leave
this
subject
which
i
never
should
have
opened
in
the
first
place.
with
dramatic
--
with
dramatic
impact
in
this
last
session
of
congress,
witnesses
from
the
bureau
of
reclamation
appeared
before
the
senate
and
the
house
appropriations
committee.
one
of
them
was
floyd
domini,
the
commissioner
of
reclamation;
the
other
was
first
assistant,
william
plumber.
plumber
testified
with
respect
to
the
question
of
--
of
what
can
be
done
in
the
way
of
saving
water
as
follows.
well,
mr.
palmrick
--
mr.
plumber
testified
in
response
to
question
by
chairman
hayden,
with
respect
to
one
dredging
in
the
colorado
river
below
parker
to
with
respect
to
off-river
basin
regulation,
above
the
mexican
border.
there
had
been
testimony
in
the
california's
--
california
has
the
right
upon
the
fact
there
must
be
a
great
waste
in
the
river.
this
is
what
mr.
plumber
said,
the
assistant
commission
of
reclamation,
“we
believe
that
the
water
salvage
operations
in
the
river
are
among
the
highest
priority
operations
of
any
--
of
the
programs
in
that
area.”
the
commissioner
had
mentioned
earlier
the
possibility
of
saving
considerable
water
by
the
construction
of
the
off-channel
work
there.
that
would
be
--
we'd
say
we
think
is
much
as
200,000
acre-feet
of
water
per
year,
200,000
acre-feet
of
water
per
year.
we
believe
that
dredging
and
proper
utilization
of
water
in
the
river
might
save
as
much
as
a
half
a
million
acre-feet
per
year.
for
the
downstream
users
the
dredging
has
to
be
an
integral
part
of
the
total
picture.
now,
the
master
said
and
that
is
why
we
feel
some
resentment
at
the
planned
assumption
by
california
that
she
makes
her
own
findings
in
this
case
with
respect
to
water
supply,
a
reading
from
103
in
his
report,
“the
evidence
in
this
case
simply
does
not
permit
a
prediction
of
future
lower
basin
supply
without
refined
degree
of
accuracy
necessary
to
show
whether
existing
california
users
can
be
satisfied
from
the
percentage
of
future
supply
apportioned
in
california.”
on
the
contrary,
the
massive
evidence
which
had
been
presented
shows
only
that
the
science
of
hydrology
is
not
capable
of
sustaining
a
prediction
accurate
enough
to
shed
light
on
the
question.
the
master
recognized
the
just
this
thing
i've
been
talking
advances
in
the
science
of
water
management.
the
management
evaporation
with
monomolecular
film
controls
evaporation
and
many
other
practices
that
can
be
put
into
effect
when
water
gets
short
render
wholly
in
apposite
in
--
inappropriate.
the
notion
of
today
predicting
what
this
arrived,
an
unforeseeable
stream
will
do.
we
agree,
if
it
please
the
court,
with
the
master
that
the
claims
of
arizona,
california
and
nevada
to
water
from
lake
mead
and
from
the
main
stream
of
the
colorado
river
below
hoover
dam
are
governed
by
the
boulder
canyon
project
act,
the
california
limitation
act,
and
the
several
water
delivery
contracts.
the
colorado
river
compact,
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment,
and
the
law
of
appropriation
are
all
irrelevant
at
the
allocation
of
such
water
among
the
states.
i
suspect
if
the
master
had
been
here
and
heard
that
mr.
ely's
explanation
of
what
he
had
held,
he
would
have
been
quite
surprised,
would've
been
quite
surprised.
now
i
know,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
it
is
inappropriate
probably
to
interpret
for
the
painter,
a
portrait
he
has
painted
but
if
i
might
because
careful
and
long
continued
reading
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
navigable
water
and
the
rights
therein
have
led
us
to
the
conclusions
we
have
reached
largely
agreed
to
by
the
master.
i
would
like
if
i
might
briefly
and
quickly
as
an
--
as
an
approach,
as
an
introduction
to
what
we
have
to
say
to
just
a
few,
to
a
couple
of
the
cases
this
court
has
decided,
two
of
them
i
want
to
have
reference
to
a
later
portion
of
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
upper
basin's
position
in
this
matter,
but
they
had
a
very
--
also
upon
the
law
of
this
court
has
declared.
the
case
of
united
states
versus
rio
grande
dam
and
irrigation
company
in
174
united
states
probably
cited
as
much
as
any
case
which
has
ever
been
before
this
court
involving
water
law.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
rio
grande
dam
and
irrigation
company
sought
to
dam
the
rio
grande
river
what
is
now
elephant
butte
dam.
that
is
above
the
navigable
portion
of
rio
grande.
in
that
case,
the
united
states
brought
suit
in
the
territorial
court
of
new
mexico
to
enjoin
that.
territorial
court
threw
them
out.
territorial
supreme
court
threw
them
out.
justice
brewer,
in
an
outstanding
opinion
analyzed
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1890.
and
i
want
to
take
the
time
to
just
read
a
little
bit
from
he
said,
because
i
think
it
is
highly
appropriate,
the
court
said,
he
first
considered
if
i
may
say
the
1866
act
which
permitted
permissibly
the
use
of
water
on
lands
in
the
west.
he
then
referred
to
the
desert
land
act
of
1877
which
if
your
honors
will
recall
related
only
to
non-navigable
water.
and
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
until
this
--
the
phrase
“non-navigable”
was
inserted
in
that
statute,
congress
refused
to
pass
it.
in
other
words,
it
was
a
compromise,
it
was
a
matter
which
was
ready
for
decision,
ready
for
enactment
but
it
couldn't
get
through
until
the
phrase
“non-navigable”
was
added
to
that
order.
the
court
has
obviously
by
this
acts,
and
that's
the
1866
--
the
1877
act,
congress
recognized
in
the
senate
to
the
appropriation
of
water
in
contravention
of
the
common
law
of
rule
as
to
permit
continuous
flow
to
infer
there
from
that
congress
intended
to
release
its
control
over
navigable
streams
of
the
country
and
to
grant
an
aid
of
mining
industries
and
the
reclamation
of
arid
lands,
the
right
to
appropriate
the
waters
of
the
sources
on
navigable
streams
to
such
an
extent
as
to
destroy
the
navigability
is
to
carry
these
statutes
beyond
what
their
fair
import
permits.
to
hold
that
congress
by
these
acts
meant
to
confer
upon
any
state,
the
right
to
appropriate
all
the
waters
of
the
tributary
streams
which
unite
into
a
navigable
water
course
and
so
destroy
the
navigability
of
that
water
course,
in
derogation
of
the
interest
of
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
is
a
construction
which
cannot
be
tolerated.
the
court
then
referring
to
the
statute,
1897,
the
language
is
general
and
must
be
given
full
scope.
it
is
not
a
prohibition
of
any
instruction
to
the
navigation,
but
any
obstruction
to
the
navigable
capacity
and
anything,
whatever
done
or
however
done
within
the
limits
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
which
tends
to
destroy
the
navigable
capacity
of
one
of
the
navigable
waters
of
united
states
is
within
the
terms
of
the
prohibition.
now
mind
you
that
was
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1890
and
while
this
case
was
under
submission,
congress
enacted
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
which
made
it
a
criminal
offense
to
impair
the
navigable
capacity
of
the
stream.
and
immediately
subsequent
to
that,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
predecessor
interest
of
imperial
irrigation
district
went
to
the
congress
and
sought
to
secure
the
admission
of
congress
to
continue
their
diversions
from
the
river
--
from
ri
--
from
the
colorado
river
and
it
was
denied.
u.s.
versus
chandler-dunbar
water
company
is
of
course
another
landmark
case
decided
in
1913
in
which
this
court
said,
“so
unfair
that
this
control
of
congress
over
navigable
streams
of
the
country
then
judgment.”
now
this
is
congress'
judgment
is
conclusive.
such
judgment
and
determination
is
the
exercise
of
legislative
power
in
respect
to
the
subject
wholly
within
its
control.
the
question
to
be
drawn
is
the
question
of
whether
the
whole
flow
of
the
streams
should
conserved
for
the
use
and
safety
of
navigation
are
questioned
legislative
in
character.
and
when
congress
determined
as
it
did
by
the
act
of
march
3,
18
--
1909,
that
the
whole
river
between
the
american
bank
and
the
international
line
as
well
as
all
the
up
and
--
north
of
the
present
ship
canal
throughout
its
entire
length
was
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
navigation
of
said
waters
and
the
matters
connected
therewith.
that
determination
was
conclusive.
one
other,
united
states
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
certainly
think
so,
your
honor,
yes.
i
certainly
think
so.
i
certainly
do
not
believe
that
california
would
concede
for
one
minute
but
that
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
win
appropriate
that
stream
as
if
it
were
non-navigable.
that
is
a
whole
basis
of
--
of
their
position.
they
had
fixed
firm
rights
in
a
navigable
stream
so
great
but
on
occasionally
exhausted
the
entire
flow
of
the
stream
despite
the
refusal
of
congress
to
give
him
that
permission.
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
point
up,
if
it
please
your
honor,
is
the
great,
the
all
persuasive,
the
all
--
the
complete
domination
which
the
congress
of
united
states
has
in
a
navigable
stream
if
it
ceased
to
act
and
i
propose
to
one
then
and
show
how
in
fact
congress
did
act
and
how
in
fact
congress
did
set
aside
this
entire
stream
and
how
it
did
in
the
exercise
of
this
dominant
servitude.
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
would
say
that,
your
honor
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
no,
i
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
must
say
that
--
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
master
relied
very
heavily
on
the
chandler-dunbar
and
the
appellation
case
and
the
others,
i
find
no
mention
of
them
in
any
california
brief.
i
find
no
attempt
to
discuss
this
question
in
any
california
brief.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
there
is
none.
so
that
if
we
can
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
everyone
is
in
agreement
on
that,
why
--
i'm
sure
this
court
is
but
i
--
simply
because
these
considerations
–
these
cases
led
us
into
the
conclusion
we
did
reach
is
the
reason
i'm
using
as
a
backdrop
for
this
--
my
argument
here.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
would
say
judge
the
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
think
they
have
carefully
avoided
considering
it.
the
other
point
that
this
court
has
made
is
that
in
addition
to
navigation
control,
that
flood
protection,
water
shed
development,
recovery
of
the
cost
of
improvements
to
utilization
of
power
are
likewise
parts
of
commerce
control.
in
other
words,
not
only
does
the
part
of
commerce
extend
to
the
matter
of
simply
governing
water
for
use
in
commerce
but
all
the
peripheral
things
that
go
with
respect
to
those
projects
are
likewise
within
the
commerce
clause.
the
--
if
the
court
please,
the
learned
judge
hand,
justice
or
judge
learned
hand,
whom
i'm
sure
we
all
respect
once
made
the
observation
that
words
are
like
semblance
which
reflect
the
color
of
their
environment.
and
i
think
to
get
a
--
an
understanding
of
the
project
act,
we
have
to
get
a
feeling
of
the
conditions
preceding
the
enactment
of
the
project
act
and
an
understanding
of
the
forces
that
were
in
play
that
brought
the
project
act
into
existence
because
to
sit
here
and
attempt
to
analyze
the
statute
wholly
apart
from
the
conflicting
forces
that
were
in
play
at
the
time
it
was
enacted
would
be
attempting
to
understand
a
language
without
having
a
full
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
some
of
the
words.
foreign
forces
quite
familiar
with
the
geography
of
the
area,
i
shall
only
say
briefly
that
the
colorado
river
as
the
master
found
is
a
stream
of
continental
proportions.
it
extends
some
1,300
miles
generally
north
from
south,
it
has
a
basin
300
feet
generally
east
and
west,
in
the
north,
500
feet
in
the
south.
but
significantly
may
it
please
the
court
is
the
great
variation
between
the
two
basins.
the
upper
basin
is
one
of
very
high
elevation,
it
produces
practically
all
the
water.
it
has
a
very
short
growing
season
and
at
the
time
that
this
project
was
in
process
of
being
enacted,
of
being
worked
out,
it
was
practically
isolated
from
the
lower
basin.
there
was
no
interrelationship
of
commerce.
there
was
no
interplay
of
exchange
of
information
other
than
in
the
securness
and
difficult
manner.
the
two
basins
are
select
--
are
divided
by
a
cabin
practically
impassable,
prior
to
the
advent
of
the
airplane.
the
colorado
river
itself,
if
it
please
the
court,
has
always
been
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
project
act,
a
very
troublesome
stream.
its
main
stream
is
fed
from
the
higher
waters
of
wyoming
and
colorado.
and
of
course
in
the
spring
when
those
water
and
those
snows
melt,
the
water
gush
down
in
torrents
and
then
came
the
summer
time
and
from
an
erratic,
unruly,
vicious
thing,
the
stream
turned
into
a
parsimonious
creature
yielding
little
water
to
those
below.
in
1905,
it
broke
through
its
banks
and
practically
--
and
unaided
the
imperial
valley.
it
carried
a
huge
load
of
silt,
all
of
which
caused
in
the
lower
valley
a
deep
desire
to
see
that
stream
controlled.
and
like
token,
by
virtue
of
the
holding
in
the
rio
grande
case
and
by
the
holding
in
the
dunbar
case,
there
was
great
concern
in
the
upper
basin
with
respect
to
whether
the
water
which
they
produced
to
be
conserved
for
their
benefit
and
use.
result
of
that
was
that
prior
to
1922,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
authorized
the
seven
basin
states
to
enter
in
a
compact
and
the
set
of
a
compact
was
result
of
that
negotiated
between
three
people
represented
the
lower
basin,
four
representing
the
upper
basin.
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
signing
of
the
compact
at
santa
fe,
there
was
a
period
of
great
confusion
and
stress.
most
of
the
states
ratified,
utah
withdrew
her
ratification,
arizona
refused
to
ratify
and
there
was
a
great
struggle
and
stress
in
the
basin
to
try
and
work
out
this
problem.
the
result
of
that
was
that
in
1927,
there
was
held
a
governor's
conference
at
denver,
colorado
in
which
the
four
governors
of
the
upper
basin
states
sat
as
a
board
of
arbitration,
as
it
were,
and
heard
the
claims
of
the
lower
basin
and
attempted
to
work
them
out.
that
was
--
or
just
a
matter
i
suggest
why
this
was
so
essential
to
the
upper
basin.
this
court
immediately
prior
to
the
signing
of
the
santa
fe
compact
had
decided
wyoming
versus
colorado
in
which
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
was
given
rather
effective
weight
in
an
interstate
apportionment.
and
of
course
the
upper
basin
state
was
tremendously
concerned.
but
with
its
short
growing
season,
it's
difficult
to
--
difficultly
of
large
irrigation
projects,
the
rapidity
with
which
the
lower
basin
were
developed,
that
it
would
serve
as
a
cow
that
provide
the
milk
and
the
lower
basin
would
get
the
milk
because
that
was
to
be
result
if
appropriation
applied
and
the
lower
basin
developed.
the
result
was
that
the
upper
basin
had
more
states,
more
concern
really
in
what
was
--
whether
to
that
project
act
than
did
the
state
of
arizona.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
four
governors
of
the
upper
basin
sat
in
comforts
in
arbitration
for
four
weeks
in
denver
of
1927.
it
is
significant,
one
of
those
governors,
one
was
frank
emerson,
one
of
the
compact
negotiators
who
signed
the
compact.
we
know
there's
present
there,
delph
carpenter,
who
was
one
of
the
outstanding
water
lawyers
of
the
west.
we
know
that
bannister
was
there,
one
of
the
outstanding
water
lawyers
of
the
west.
we
know
that
was
a
conference
of
the
outstanding
water
lawyers,
the
outstanding
water
people
of
the
west
concerned
with
this
problem.
we're
not
here
to
take
issue
with
the
special
master's
assertion
that
iii
(a)
and
iii
(d)
are
not
the
same
thing.
this
isn't
the
place
to
argue
it
in
the
absence
of
the
upper
basin.
we
are
concerned
here
with
only
--
with
demonstrating
only
one
thing
that
regardless
of
whether
the
master
was
right
or
wrong,
that
what
congress
dealt
with
in
the
project
act
was
main
stream
water,
that
what
congress
was
dealing
with
was
the
water
which
came
down
at
lee
ferry,
whether
it
was
called
the
pink
water
or
iii
(a)
water
or
three
daughter,
we
care
not
because
once
you
conclude
that
the
water
that
the
congress
dealt
with
in
the
project
act
was
water
from
the
upper
basin,
the
name
you
give
it
becomes
wholly
immaterial.
now,
i
have
said,
if
it
please
that
court,
that
of
these
four
governors,
one
was
a
compact
commissioner.
we
know
that
one
other
member
who
was
there
as
an
advisor
was
a
compact
commissioner,
delph
carpenter.
we
know
that
the
upper
basin
had
a
great
interest
in
what
happened
in
the
lower
basin
and
what
did
the
governors
do?
they
finally
made
their
recommendation
of
the
annual
--
average
annual
delivery
of
water
to
be
provided
by
the
states
of
the
upper
division
at
lee
ferry
under
the
terms
of
the
colorado
river
compact,
nevada
300,000,
arizona
3
million,
and
california
4,200,000.
this
is
of
the
average
annual
delivery
at
lee
ferry.
lee
ferry,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
the
--
so
to
speak,
middle
of
the
hourglass
between
the
upper
and
the
lower
basin.
now,
water
at
lee
ferry
had
to
the
upper
basin
water,
it
couldn't
be
lower
basin
water.
now,
there's
an
interesting
and
significant
thing.
in
addition,
arizona
is
to
have
a
million
acre-feet
of
the
tributaries
provided
that
whatever
goes
into
the
gila
and
new
mexico
is
available
for
mexico.
then,
of
all
the
waters
of
the
tributaries
of
the
colorado
river
emptying
in
the
river
below
lee
ferry,
not
a
portion
in
paragraph
2,
that's
the
million
to
arizona,
each
of
the
states
of
the
lower
basin
shall
have
the
exclusive,
beneficial,
consumptive
use
in
such
tributaries
within
its
boundaries
before
the
same
emptying
into
the
main
stream
provided
that
a
portion
between
two
states
of
this
interstate
will
be
by
compact
or
by
court.
but
the
significant
thing,
the
significant
thing
is
the
last
provision
which
says
that
arizona
and
california
may
each
use
half
of
the
surplus
water
in
the
main
stream
but
that
is
subject
to
reapportionment
in
1963.
your
honors
will
recall
that
under
the
compact,
one
of
the
provisions
was
that
the
unused
or
surplus
water
should
be
subject
to
reapportionment
in
1963.
what
did
the
upper
basin
governors
do?
they
gave
away,
if
california's
right
is
what
the
compact
means,
they
gave
away
the
lower
basin
tributaries
entirely
because
they
said
that's
not
subject
to
reapportionment
and
the
only
thing
they
say
for
reapportionment
was
the
main
stream
of
the
colorado
river.
now,
if
you
gentlemen
appreciate
how
bitterly,
how
bitterly
and
i
said
it
advisory,
water
fillings
rise,
how
people
will
literally
fight
for
water
that
means
nothing,
simply
because
it's
water.
to
consider
for
one
minute
that
the
governors
of
the
upper
basin
states
said,
“we
relinquish
our
right
to
the
tributaries
of
the
lower
basin
for
reapportionment
of
the
1963
is
ridiculous.”
when
they
say,
“all
we
say
for
reapportionment
in
1963
is
the
main
stream”,
to
me
it
can
mean
only
one
thing
and
that
is
that
those
governors,
frank
emerson,
the
other
governors
considered
iii
(a)
and
iii
(d)
the
same,
they
considered
that
the
water
which
the
upper
basin
let
down
at
lee
ferry
was
iii
(a)
water.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
no,
your
honor.
so
far
as
we
know,
neither
the
congress
nor
governors
dealt
with
shortage.
now,
as
we
approach
the
understanding
of
the
project
act,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
just
a
little
bit
what
the
attitude
of
the
upper
basin
was,
because
as
i
said
in
the
former
argument
here,
little
puny,
arizona
did
not
stand
in
the
way
of
the
project.
little
puny,
arizona
in
1929
did
not
stop
the
project
act.
the
upper
basin
stopped
the
project
act
until
it
got
such
guarantees
as
it
thought
sufficient
to
protect
the
bonanza
which
it
gave
birth
to
in
the
upper
reaches
of
the
river
against
the
uses
below.
delph
carpenter,
and
again
i
say
that
according
to
all
we
read
and
all
we
know
was
one
of
the
outstanding
water
lawyers
of
the
west.
you'll
find
his
name
in
many
of
the
water
cases
before
this
court
as
was
were
bannister.
he
testified
before
the
--
one
of
the
committees
of
congress
when
section
5
was
in
the
process
of
evolution,
he
referred
to
this
section
5
which
had
been
reported
out
of
committee,
the
committee
headed
by
senator
hiram
johnson
and
he
says
this,
“referring
to
the
amendments
in
section
we
just
read,
the
upper
states
suggested
a
formal
amendment
of
defiance
and
so
on.”
however,
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
paragraph
of
section
5,
beginning
at
line
10
are
words,
and
this
is
from
our
legislative
history
at
page
6,
“no
person
shall
have
or
be
entitled
to
have
the
use
for
any
purpose
of
the
water
stored
as
aforesaid
except
by
contract
made
as
herein
stated.”
that
is
the
question
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
directed
to
mr.
ely,
what
did
that
mean
or
this
leads
into
that
question.
that
amendment
is
proposed
by
the
upper
states
for
the
fundamental
reason
i
have
assigned
at
the
outset
of
my
statement
today,
which
is
that
we
insist
that
no
use
occurred
by
reason
of
this
structure
which
may
later
be
said
to
be
independent
of
the
compact
and
be
asserted
as
adverse
to
the
upper
states.
if
the
secretary
of
the
interior
should
contact
for
the
use
of
water
to
somebody
in
a
manner
but
did
not
obligate
them
to
respect
the
compact,
then
they
would
be
later
convinced
they
were
not
found.
the
upper
states
do
not
fear
the
outcome
of
litigation.
they
do
insist
that
they
be
protected
by
interstate
compact
of
any
unwarranted
assertions
or
threats
by
the
states
of
the
lower
basin
against
present
or
future
development
in
the
upper
basin
by
a
reason
of
further
developments
in
the
lower
basin.
such
uncertainties
embarrassed
the
upper
states
in
encouraging
private
capital
to
develop
their
resources
and
the
natural
adjustment
--
legitimate
improvement
of
their
territory.
then
mr.
taylor
spoke
up
and
said,
“colorado
has
had
25
years
of
litigation
with
kansas
and
wyoming
over
these
matters
and
other
states
and
have
that
trouble
and
we
want
to
avoid
it
in
the
future
as
possible.”
“yes”,
mr.
carpenter
and
that
litigation
has
been
unsatisfactorily
to
all
litigants
as
put
a
cloud
on
the
title
of
waters,
water
rights
of
great
rivers,
valleys
and
has
worked
no
good
to
anyone,
nevertheless,
was
effective
in
destroying
development
in
the
upper
country
for
years.
then
he
said,
“it
is
not
our
thought
in
insisting
upon
amendments
of
this
build
to
embarrass
the
state
of
arizona
or
to
put
her
in
an
unfavorable
decision.”
arizona
has
many
problems
common
with
us.
she's
entitled
a
full
protection.
she's
our
friend
and
we
insist
a
justice
for
her.
we
are
not
the
proponents
of
this
bill.
we
have
always
insisted
upon
a
seven-state
compact
before
construction
of
any
further
works,
anywhere
in
the
basin.
but
if
congress
is
to
proceed
now,
we
insist
on
protective
amendments.”
senator
hiram
johnson,
the
manager
of
this
bill
in
congress,
senior
senator,
man
whom
we
all,
either
have
known
of
or
have
read
of,
i
repeat
and
--
and
this
now
is
when
he
reported
out
in
the
first
session
of
the
70th
congress,
the
bill
which
section
5
was
now
evolving.
i
repeat
and
repeat,
“now,
we
have
endeavored
to
protect
these
upper
basin
states.
we
write
the
bill
around
the
compact.
we
make
every
drop
of
water
that
comes
from
storage
and
the
regulation
of
the
colorado
river
under
this
scheme,
subject
to
the
compact
not
just
the
water
that
comes
out
of
storage
but
the
regulation
of
the
river.
we
write
then
that
california
shall
use
perpetually
only
a
specific
amount
of
water
naming
the
maximum
amount
which
may
be
used.
all
of
these
things
are
done
in
a
good
faith
endeavored
to
protect
in
every
possible
way
the
states
of
the
upper
basin
and
those
who
claim
they
want
protection
under
the
colorado
river
compact,
yet
some
of
them
would
prefer
to
let
this
water
continue
to
flow
down
to
the
sea
for
an
indefinite
period,
to
go
to
waste
in
the
gulf
of
colorado.
the
land
remained
in
drought
in
the
det
--
to
the
detriment
of
the
people
of
southern
arizona
and
southern
california.
prevent
this
to
be
done
indefinitely
rather
than
to
permit
the
measure
of
protection.”
then
he
said
this,
“ah,
this
is
senator
hiram
johnson
speaking,
california's
manager
of
the
bill,
the
man
responsible
for
its
language
when
faced
--
if
california
comes
here
and
tells
you
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
was
to
continue,
“ah,
you
will
see
in
the
days
to
come
what
will
happen
in
that
river
if
no
protection
be
accorded
to
those
people
and
the
appropriation
law
of
the
west
be
permitted
to
obtain.”
this
is
senator
hiram
johnson
warning
of
the
hazards
that
would
come
if
the
appropriation
of
law
of
the
west
were
permitted
to
continue
and
this
is
when
the
final
form
of
section
5
in
the
project
act
was
taking
shape.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
no,
your
honor.
that
was
removed;
if
i
may,
i'll
turn
to
that
immediately.
the
court
will
recall
that
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
the
compact
that
the
swing-johnson
bills
were
introduced
in
congress,
there
were
four
of
them.
the
first
two
got
nowhere.
the
third
began
to
show
some
evolution,
get
to
show
some
progress.
and
in
1926,
the
bill
as
then
introduced
by
senator
hiram
johnson
in
february
27,
1926,
a
limiting
portion
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
lawsuit
provided
as
far
that
said
secretary
is
hereby
authorized
and
so
on,
contract
respecting
water
for
domestic
use
may
be
for
permanent
service
but
subject
to
rights
of
prior
appropriators.
in
other
words,
at
this
point
we
have
a
specific
finding,
a
specific
provision
in
the
bill
that
rights
of
prior
appropriators
are
to
be
respected.
now,
if
you
would
remove
that
please
mr.
gruber,
as
reported
out
of
the
69th
congress
by
the
senate
committee
of
[inaudible]
in
this
same
session,
these
are
the
changes
that
appeared
and
this
again
is
a
committee
headed
by
senator
hiram
johnson.
this
is
not
some
--
well,
had
no
interest
in
the
matter
at
all,
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
hereby
authorized
on
such
general
regulations
that
he
may
prescribe
it
to
contract
for
the
storage
of
water
in
said
reservoir
and
for
the
delivery
thereof
at
such
points
on
the
river
and
on
said
canals
may
be
agreed
upon
for
irrigation
and
domestic
uses.
contract
respecting
water
for
and
he
added
irrigation
and
domestic
uses,
they
struck
out
“may”
and
said
“shall”
be
for
permanent
service
and
they
struck
out
but
subject
to
the
rights
of
prior
appropriators.
i
do
not
see
how,
if
it
please
the
court,
we
can
have
a
clear
indication
that
the
upper
basin
states
had
written
their
desires
into
this
bill
and
had
said
prior
appropriation
is
out.
so
far
as
we're
concerned
and
let
me
say,
if
i
may
please
the
court,
that
had
the
california
at
that
time
made
the
assertion
she's
making
before
this
court
today,
the
project
act
would
never
have
been
enacted,
the
project
act
would
never
have
been
passed.
alright,
now
let's
look
at
the
next
step
in
the
evolution
of
section
5
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
the
reason
--
the
reason
if
it
please
you,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
that
arizona
had
not
ratified
the
compact.
arizona
was
still
outside
the
compact
and
therefore,
as
i
will
read
to
you
in
a
minute,
the
people
of
the
upper
basin
said,
“well
look,
this
limits
of
the
lower
basin
to
only
7,500,000,
that's
true,
but
arizona
hasn't
signed
the
compact,
so
arizona
will
come
in
and
take
7,500,000,
california
takes
7,500,000
because
arizona
is
not
bound
by
the
compact.”
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
bitter
[inaudible]
that
occurred
in
the
evolution
of
this
bill.
now,
this
is
as
reported
out
of
the
senate
committee
on
irrigation
and
reclamation
march
20,
1928.
this
is
the
first
session
of
the
70th
congress.
we
find
for
the
first
time
a
provision
for
limiting
california's
right.
the
first
portion
is
the
same,
contracts
providing
water
for
irrigation
and
domestic
use
shall
be
for
permanent
service
provided
however,
that
said
contracts
shall
not
provide
for
an
aggregate
annual
consumptive
use
in
california
of
more
than
4,680,000
acre-feet
of
water,
allocated
to
the
lower
basin
by
the
colorado
river
compact
mentioned
in
section
12
and
one
half
of
the
unallocated
excess
and/or
surplus
water
provided
further
that
those
such
contracts
shall
be
made
until
california
by
act
of
its
legislature
shall
have
ratified
and
approved
before
going
provision
for
use
of
water
in
said
state.
senator
hiram
johnson,
manager
of
the
bill,
most
influential,
one
of
the
most
influential
senators
in
the
senate,
reporting
this
--
the
report
which
came
out
over
his
signature
making
this
change
said,
“here,
finally
is
presented
a
unified
plan
for
protecting
those
entitled
to
protection
for
the
allocation
when
the
states
desiring
that
allocation
of
waters
of
a
great
river
to
which
all
are
entitled
for
the
elimination
of
intolerable
conditions
of
which
[inaudible],
protected
part
of
the
united
states
is
dependent
and
so
on.”
now,
in
other
words,
senator
hiram
johnson,
the
manager
of
the
bill,
the
senator
whom
this
court
has
said
you
would
look
most
directly
for
its
legislative
history,
its
meaning,
his
committee,
he
is
the
chairman,
reported
this
out
saying,
“here
is
finally
a
unified
plan
for
protecting
those
entitled
to
protection
and
for
allocating
among
those
states
entitled,
the
most
states
desiring
that
that
allocation
of
water
of
a
great
river
and
so
on,
to
which
they
are
entitled.”
now,
two
things
seemed
to
me
to
be
self-evident
which
cannot
be
disputed.
one
is
that
this
is
main
stream
water.
this
has
to
be
main
stream
water
because
it's
going
to
be
stored
in
the
only
place
where
main
stream
water
can
be
stored
above
the
lower
basin.
in
other
words,
we
have
to
be
talking
at
this
point
about
main
stream
water
stored
in
the
--
in
the
reservoir
coming
from
the
upper
basin.
there
is
no
way
we
can
avoid
that.
you
can
kick
and
talk
all
you
want
to,
but
the
facts
are
--
the
facts,
what
we're
talking
about
and
you
will
see
that,
if
it
please
you,
members
of
the
court,
that
this
provision,
this
provision
here
was
literally
moved
into
section
4
by
senator
phipps,
i
will
deal
that
in
just
a
moment.
the
following
--
the
last
is
the
provisions
of
the
section
5
as
an
act,
as
an
act
in
december
of
1928
which
eliminated
the
portion
i
have
just
referred
to,
the
proviso
as
to
the
limitation
in
the
contracts.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
that
was
--
that
was
--
went
into
section
4,
your
honor.
i
will
--
i
can
--
i
will
demonstrate
that
in
a
moment.
it
eliminated
that
at
this
point
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
the
significant
thing,
mr.
justice
douglas
is
that
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
if
it
please
the
court,
the
amendment,
the
amendment
which
put
the
limitation
in
section
4
took
this
amendment
out
of
section
--
this
language
was
section
5.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
and
added
the
language
and
shall
conform
to
paragraph
a
of
section
4
of
this
act.
in
other
words,
i
think
it
is
demonstrable
--
it
is
demonstrable
that
senator
phipps,
when
he
proposed
the
amendment
of
section
4
which
is
presently
--
practically
the
statute
moved
literally,
bodily
the
limitation
from
section
5
over
to
section
4,
and
at
the
same
time
added
that
such
contract
shall
conform
to
section
4
(a).
we
regard
that
is
highly
significant.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
no,
it
has
not,
your
honor.
i
do
intend
to
deal
with
that
and
i
believe
i
can
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
no,
i
understand.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
if
i
may
say
this,
your
honor,
the
basis
for
our
taking
your
valuable
time
in
talking
about
the
upper
basin's
position
in
this
controversy
is
to
show
how
strongly
their
hand
was
laid
upon
the
project
act
and
how
careful
they
were,
how
desirous
they
were
and
how
they
in
fact
issued
an
ultimatum
against
anything
unless
there
is
enough
water
left
available
for
arizona
that
they
did
not
need
to
worry
about
california.
in
other
words,
a
scheme
has
finally
evolved
was
it
if
we
limit
california
of
the
first
seven
million
five,
four
million
four,
four
million
two,
or
four
million
six
that
of
necessity
is
going
to
be
two
or
three
million
or
thereabout
left
were
alone
that
you
can't
notice
very
much.
that
was
the
language
of
senator
pittman
when
he
--
senator
phipps.
now
on
this,
there
was
an
agreement
as
to
exactly
how
much
water
should
go
to
the
lower
states
out
of
the
7,500,000
acre-feet
that
went
down
to
them,
what
might
be
the
result.
if
arizona
stays
out
of
the
agreement,
she
would
have
her
legal
right
to
appropriate
as
much
water
as
she
could
put
to
beneficial
use.
on
the
other
hand,
california
would
only
be
restricted
by
the
7,500,000
acre-feet
that
went
down.
with
the
result,
there
will
be
nothing
in
the
compact
to
prevent
california
from
using
the
entire
7,500,000
acre-feet
and
there'd
be
nothing
in
the
compact
to
prevent
arizona
from
using
the
7,500,000
acre-feet
if
she
never
went
into
the
compact.
so
the
upper
basin
said,
“we
have
got
to
be
assured
there's
not
to
be
using
lower
basin
more
the
7,500,000
acre-feet.”
if
there
is
more
used
than
we
--
then
when
we
get
ready
to
use
it
in
the
future
will
not
exist
of
the
law
of
appropriation
that
applies
in
that
section
of
the
country.
consequently,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
arizona
might
never
go
into
the
compact,
might
never
be
found
by
the
compact,
might
be
perfectly
free
to
exercise
their
equal
right
and
put
too
much
use
than
she
could
to
put
the
benefits
used,
it
was
said
on
the
committee.
if
arizona
does
not
come
in
to
the
--
does
not
come
in
and
if
it
is
limited
to
six-states
only,
then
we
must
be
assured
that
california
will
not
take
the
full
7,500,000
acre-feet
and
then
arizona
takes
some
more.
so,
the
senator
from
wyoming,
mr.
kendrick
offered
an
amendment
committee
to
which
the
committee
agreed
that
that
amendment
provided
that
california
should
never
--
consumptive
use
of
the
colorado
river
more
than
4,600,000
acre-feet.
the
entire
legislative
scheme,
if
it
please
the
court,
was
simply
this
that
the
upper
basin
states
were
not
going
to
permit
the
building
of
this
great
storage
dam
unless
and
until
they
had
reasonable
assurances
that
the
lower
basin
was
not
going
to
--
outside
the
compact
under
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
demand
more
water
from
them
than
they
were
willing
to
let
down.
now,
with
respect
to
section
4
(a),
the
section
following
the
governor's
conference
which
i
referred
to,
that
is
in
1927,
the
governor's
conference
in
this
--
in
the
1928
first
session
of
the
78th
congress
there
was
a
rather
large
number
of
proposed
amendments
introduced;
one,
by
senator
water
--
waterman,
one
by
senator
ralston,
one
by
senator
phipps
and
one
--
not
introduced,
i
shouldn't
have
said
that,
printed
and
left
to
lay
on
the
table,
and
one
by
senator
pittman.
the
two
that
are
significant
for
the
short
time
we
have
here
are
the
amendments
of
senator
phipps
and
senator
pittman.
senator
pittman
on
the
28th
of
may
asked
for
floor
and
received
and
he
--
and
i'm
going
to
be
--
i'm
going
to
excerpt
--
this
is
all
our
legislative
history.
he
--
of
course,
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
of
the
governor's
conference
and
he
said
that
we
spent
four
weeks
in
denver,
colorado
last
summer
and
that's
in
discussing
it,
that
is
arizona
and
california's
rights.
at
that
time
california
demanded
so
much,
arizona
demanded
so
much
and
then
he
said,
“so
we
have
nothing
but
the
question
of
division
of
water
that
separates
the
two
states.”
nevada
is
not
complaining
about
the
water,
she
has
always
accepted
a
little
handful
of
water
which
was
given
her.
but
when
we
assembled
at
denver,
the
governors
of
the
four
upper
basin
states,
trying
to
reconcile
the
differences,
gave
these
amounts
i've
previously
read.
how
did
they
get
at
that?
under
what
is
called
the
seven-state
agreement
we
find
in
clause
iii
(a),
the
following
and
that
is
the
language
of
iii
(a).
in
other
words,
the
state
governors
believe
there
was
only
7,500,000
acre-feet
to
divide
and
they
proposed
to
divide
it
as
we
have
said.
that
even
refers
to
the
fact
they'd
had
a
friendly
meeting
in
their
office
and
i
dare
say
you
gentlemen
are
far
more
cognizant
of
the
scenario
that
this
was
the
period
to
permit,
it
was
the
period
of
negotiation,
it
was
the
period
of
many
meetings,
in
many
smoked
filled
rooms.
and
this
--
in
other
words
we
discovered
that
there
was
another
million
acre-feet
and
he
referred
to
iii
(b),
he
said
that
--
then
when
we
came
back
here,
there
are
no
agreement
was
reached
and
never
has
been,
that
no
provision
in
the
bill
with
regard
to
the
division
of
water
and
a
meeting
held
in
my
office
between
the
friendly
representatives
of
arizona,
california
and
nevada,
we
came
up
with
this
suggestion.
then
he
proposed
the
--
not
proposed,
he
filed
and
had
printed
to
lay
on
the
table
an
amendment
which
for
practically
word
for
word
is
hayden
amendment
which
was
introduced
in
the
second
session
of
the
78th
congress
provided
for
a
seven-state
ratification
and
provided
for
a
tri-state
compulsory
compact.
the
phipps
amendment
which
was
printed
and
let
lay
on
the
table
was
almost
identically
the
amendment
which
he
then
introduced
later
in
the
78th
congress,
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
minute.
when
the
78th
congress
met,
second
session,
it
was
apparent
that
the
boys
had
done
their
homework
because
the
first
thing
that
happened
was
that
senator
hiram
johnson
asked
for
unanimous
consent
that
the
house
bill,
house
version
of
the
swing-johnson
bill
be
in
effect
amended
by
cutting
it
to
pieces
except
for
its
title
and
substituting
in
lieu
thereof
the
senate
version
which
had
been
through
the
various
committee
hearings
in
the
senate.
now,
if
the
court
will
recall
that
to
borrow
senator
ashurst's
phrase
at
the
end
of
the
first
session
of
the
senate
--
78th
congress,
he
and
senator
hayden
had
retired
to
the
rocky
--
sale
of
the
rocky,
something
rather
of
the
senate
rules
and
had
fought
a
bitter
--
a
bitter
filibuster
which
prevented
action
in
the
first
session.
so
we
find
all
this
piece
inquired
of,
at
the
opening
of
the
second
session.
no
one
objects.
the
senate
version
is
replaced,
replaced
with
the
house
version
and
on
the
morning
of
the
following
legislative
day,
this
december
6,
senator
ashurst
makes
the
following
statement.
“mr.
president,
yesterday
just
prior
to
adjournment
of
the
senate,
i
offered
an
amendment
to
the
senate
bill
that
has
been
offered
as
a
substitute
for
house
bill
5773
which
relates
to
an
apportionment
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
to
the
lower
basin
of
that
stream.”
the
amendment
was
taken
from
the
congressional
record
of
may
28,
1928.
on
that
day
the
senior
senator
from
nevada
asked
to
have
the
amendment
printed
in
the
congressional
record
for
the
information
to
the
senate.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
this
amendment,
this
pittman
amendment
was
the
amendment
evolved
as
the
result
of
the
governor's
conference
though
i
have
not
time
to
read
it,
senator
pittman
in
may
28
when
he
had
it
printed
said
that
mr.
francis
wilson,
one
of
the
outstanding
water
lawyers
of
new
mexico
had
attended
the
conference
and
had
drafted
this
amendment
during
the
course
of
the
conference.
so
we
find
that
senator
hayden's
amendment
as
presented
is
the
result
of
the
draftsmanship
of
mr.
francis
wilson
as
a
result
of
the
governor's
conference.
this
amendment
provided
for
seven-state
ratification.
it
provided
for
the
elimination
of
the
gila,
the
lower
basin
rates
and
it
required
that
california
should
be
limited
to
four
million
two
of
iii
(a)
water.
this
was
debated
for,
i
believe
four
days,
december
10th
during
the
course
of
which
there
was
many
things
said,
i'm
not
going
to
attempt
to
repeat
them
all
because
we
haven't
the
time,
but
on
the
10th
of
december,
senator
phipps
arose
and
addressed
the
chair
and
the
following
took
place.
i'm
reading
from
page
50,
nevada
legislative
history.
mr.
phipps:
“i
understand
that
the
pending
amendment
is
the
one
offered
by
the
junior
senators
from
arizona.
i
desire
to
offer
an
amendment
to
that
amendment
which
i
believe
is
permissible
under
the
rule
enforced.”
but
may
i
simply
call
your
attention
to
this,
that
before
senator
phipps
offered
this
amendment
he
was
clear
that
the
amendment
pending
was
a
hayden
amendment.
and
the
hayden
amendment
did
two
things.
i
mean,
it
had
in
two
parts
of
it.
first,
was
the
general
limitation
i
spoken
of;
the
second
was
a
compulsory
compact
between
the
three
states
of
the
lower
basin
pursuant
to
which
arizona,
nevada,
and
california
must
agree
as
to
division
of
water.
so
he
carefully
--
he's
careful
to
be
sure
that
he
was
talking
about
the
hayden
amendment
which
was
the
pittman
amendment
when
phipps
had
his
amendment
printed
in
the
first
session.
the
chair
said,
i
asked
to
have
my
amendment,
the
amendment
printed
in
the
record,
there
will
be
no
objection
the
amendment
was
ordered
and
printed
as
follows.
now,
on
page
five,
strike
out
all
of
lines
1
to
18
inclusive
and
insert
in
lieu
thereof
the
following.
that
struck
out,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
first
paragraph
of
the
hayden
amendment
that
eliminated
that
and
substituted
in
lieu
of
it
the
language
of
the
phipps
amendment
but
left
intact
and
as
a
part
of
section
5,
the
compulsory,
the
compulsory
prior
state
allocation
of
water.
it
did
not
eliminate
that,
it
left
it
there.
so
that
senator
phipps
was
proposing
to
amend
a
--
the
section
5
which
contained
a
compulsory
compact
with
his
amendment
relating
only
to
what
is
now
the
first
paragraph
of
section
4.
and
as
a
part
of
that
same
amendment
on
page
six,
strike
out
at
line
25
and
on
page
seven,
lines
1
to
8
inclusive
and
insert
in
lieu
thereof
to
the
following,
permanent
service
as
of
conformed
to
paragraph
a
of
section
4
of
this
act,
no
person
shall.
in
other
words,
as
a
part
of
this
very
amendment,
senator
phipps
struck
out
of
section
5,
the
underlined
portion
of
section
5
that
you
saw
on
the
previous
exhibit
and
substituted
in
lieu
thereof
the
language,
“and
shall
conform
to
the
provisions
of
section
4
(a).”
at
that
time,
the
direction
to
the
secretary
was
that
he
was
to
--
his
contracts
were
to
conform
to
section
4
(a),
which
at
that
time
did
require
a
mandatory
--
formed
a
mandatory
division
of
the
water.
and
at
that
time
the
amendment
of
senator
phipps
for
all
practical
purposes
transferred
the
limitation
from
section
5
(a)
to
section
4.
we
think
that
is
highly
significant.
now,
thereafter
there
was
some
debate
and
then
this
will
--
significant
thing
occurred.
senator
hayden
addressed
the
senate.
he
said,
“i
desire
to
array
--
i
desire
to
arrange
so
that
senate
may
vote
upon
the
impression
of
whether
it
shall
be
one
figure
or
the
other.
i
would
to
inquire
of
the
president
of
the
senate
whether
if
i
should
withdraw
in
them
which
i
have
offered
within
the
amendment
offered
by
the
senator
in
colorado
be
an
amendment
in
the
second
degree
and
subject
to
amendment.”
in
other
words,
senator
hiram
johnson,
the
amendment
was
one
in
the
first
degree;
hayden's
amendment
was
one
of
the
second
degree
and
therefore
the
phipps
amendment
to
the
hayden
amendment
was
one
in
the
third
degree
and
not
subject
to
amendment.
so
that
the
result
was
that
senate
--
that
senator
hayden
said,
“i
want
to
state
to
the
senate
that
what
i'm
trying
to
accomplish
is
to
get
a
vote
on
the
one
particular
question
of
whether
the
quantity
of
water
which
the
state
of
california
may
divert
in
the
colorado
rivers
should
4,200,000
acre-feet
or
4,600,000
acre-feet.”
i
can
state
in
10
or
15
minutes
the
reason
why
it
should
be
done.
he
did,
the
amendment
was
voted
down.
in
other
words,
the
senate
rejected
the
4,200,000
acre-feet.
then
senator
bratton
proposed
an
amendment
which
changed
the
phipps
amendment
from
4,200,000
to
4,400,000
and
he
said
in
proposing
that
amendment,
“mr.
president,
it
is
perfectly
obvious
to
all
of
us
that
we
have
an
immense
project
here,
respecting
in
which
these
two
states,
california
and
arizona
cannot
agree.
dispute
has
narrowed
itself
primarily
to
400,000
acre-feet
of
water.
california
is
saying
that
4,600,000
acre-feet
is
her
--
here,
it
is
the
minimum
and
arizona
insists
and
that
california
shall
be
limited
to
4,200,000
acre-feet.”
it
seems
to
me
therefore
mr.
president
that
injustice
of
the
two
states,
they
haven't
been
unable
to
agree,
we
should
tender
our
offices
by
dividing
the
differences
and
requiring
california
to
limit
herself
in
her
act
of
ratification
irrevocably
and
unconditionally
to
a
maximum
consumptive
use
of
4,400,000
acre-feet
that
divides
the
difference
and
that
the
amount
fixed
the
amendment
i
have
proposed.
it
differs
from
the
proposal
of
the
senator
from
colorado
by
reducing
california's
claim
200,000
acre-feet.
it
differs
from
the
amendment
of
the
senator
from
arizona
by
increasing
200,000
acre-feet.
i
think
we
should
adopt
that
course.
this
controversy
does
not
affect
two
states
alone.
it
affects
the
states,
other
states
of
the
union
and
the
government
as
well.
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
“i
suggest
4,400,000
acre-feet.”
there
was
no
question
they're
talking
about
main
stream
water
and
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
that
congress
at
this
time
considered
that
it
was
allocating
and
dividing
the
water
which
was
to
be
stored
in
the
--
on
the
main
stream
of
the
colorado
river
and
by
virtue
of
the
project
act.
again,
senator
pittman,
“what
is
the
difficulty?
we
have
only
minor
questions
involved
here.”
there's
practically
nothing
involved
except
the
dispute
between
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
state
of
california
with
regard
to
the
addition
of
the
increase
water
that
will
be
impounded
behind
the
proposed
dam.
that
is
all.
an
agreement
has
been
entered
into
between
the
seven-states
interceding
the
river
by
which
half
of
that
water
is
retained
in
the
upper
states
and
near
half
of
it,
left
down
to
the
three
lower
states.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
now,
before
--
i
would
say
this,
“i
do
not
think
anyone
can
read
the
legislative
history,
the
project
act
objective
and
conclude
other
than
the
congress
were
dealing
with,
it
was
handling
--
it
was
dividing
main
stream
waters”,
and
if
that
conclusion
is
reached
all
the
rest
of
the
talk
about
the
lower
basin
tributaries
and
its
--
congress'
intent
to
divide
that,
of
course
falls
by
the
wayside.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
surely,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
main
stream,
exactly.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
your
honor,
i
--
i
could
get
rid
of
that
given
enough
time
but
i'm
afraid
the
time
is
a
little
difficult.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
in
this
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i'd
answer
that
this
way
your
honor,
correct
me,
justice
douglas.
we
do
not
think
that
what
the
negotiators
of
the
compact
thought
governs
what
the
congress
of
the
united
states
did
in
enacting
the
project
act.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
in
other
words
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
it
certainly
does
your
honor.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
your
honor,
the
problem
is
very
difficult.
and
it's
one
that
requires
a
law
that
extends
the
treatment,
i
would
simply
say
this,
“it
is
our
belief
that
the
project
act
itself
furnishes
a
guide
to
what
is
to
be
done
with
this
water
and
as
it
interpreted
the
project,
the
compact,
that
is
the
thing
that
it
must
go
right
in
the
determination
of
this
case.”
in
other
words,
if
congress
saw
fit
to
make
a
reference
to
compact
terms
and
someone
disagrees
with
today,
we're
not
really
concerned
with
that.
we're
concern
what
did
congress
mean.
what
was
congress
talking
about?
what
was
congress
attempting
to
divide?
and
there
is
no
word,
a
word
of
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
congress
thought
that
it
was
dividing
the
tributaries
of
the
lower
basin,
not
a
word.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
it
was
intended,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
do
exactly
that
or
rather
i
would
say
this,
the
denver
governor's
conference
formed
this
--
the
spring
board
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
--
which
resulted
in
the
compromise
which
was
up
to
that
part
have
been
impossible.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
excuse
me.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
your
honor
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
let
me
express
it
this
way.
senator
hayden
throughout
all
the
debates
was
faced
with
the
fact
that
in
arizona,
there
was
a
great
fear
that
this
arizona
--
that
the
senate
--
the
compact
would
open
the
gates
of
the
dams
in
arizona
to
the
mexican
treaty.
that
was
the
main
reason
why
arizona
never
ratified
the
santa
fe
compact
for
many
years.
it
was
afraid
that
would
open
the
gates
of
roosevelt
dam
in
times
of
shortage
to
supply
the
mexican
treaty.
and
senator
hayden
therefore
was
constantly
met
with
that
problem
in
his
own
home
state
and
the
purpose
of
this
provision
in
section
4
giving
arizona
the
gila,
mr.
justice
douglas,
was
simply
a
soft
--
thrown
to
the
home
hopes
--
in
the
hopes
that
they
would
ratify
the
project
act,
would
ratify
the
compact.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
let
me
express
it
otherwise,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
no.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
if
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
i
--
let
me
express
it
this
way.
the
only
thing
before
the
congress
that
they
were
concerned
with
and
the
only
thing
they
dealt
in
dividing
in
the
sense
of
--
what
we're
talking
about
here
was
the
water
in
the
--
stored
in
the
reservoir.
that
you
cannot
read,
if
it
please,
your
honor
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
--
in
that
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
but
may
i
read
you
an
exchange
between
senator
hayden
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
--
and
senator
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
we
have
--
of
saying
in
our
country
that
the
something
as
pure
it's
a
little
gift
that
--
a
person
who's
spanish
to
send
gifts,
that's
something
that's
thrown
in
and
i
think
that
the
--
so
far
as
the
provision
of
this
tri-state
compact
is
concerned
that
that
was
simply
a
gesture.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
pardon?
no.
i
hope
--
i
didn't
mean
--
i
meant
congress
without
reading
that
way
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
with
just
this
court
was.
i
think
the
true
explanation
your
honor
is
that
in
drafting
the
project
act,
the
senators
of
the
upper
basin,
the
senators
in
arizona
and
in
california
were
most
desirous
of
arizona
ratifying
the
compact
regardless.
they
felt
that
was
a
safest
thing
to
do.
and
in
the
project
act
i
think
that
the
provisions
of
that
proposed
tri-state
compact
were
intended
to
encourage
arizona
to
ratify
the
compact
but
that
has
nothing
to
do,
if
it
please
the
court,
with
the
division
of
the
water
in
the
lake
mead.
in
other
words,
there
are
two
--
two
things
that
are
involved
here.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
i'm
--
i
understand
that
your
honor
and
i
didn't
mean
to
be
presumptuous,
i
assure
you.
the
--
the
thing
that
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
congress
had
before
it
--
before
it
the
decision
the
question
of
should
it
build
or
it
should
it
not
build
the
project
act.
congress
had
the
fact
that
it
would
store
this
great
body
of
water
and
have
the
responsibility
of
dividing
it.
now,
to
my
way
of
thinking
that
was
the
main
theme
of
the
discussion
before
congress.
now,
before
we
leave
that
subject,
i
just
like
to
bring
these
thoughts
to
your
honors'
mind
with
respect
to
the
question
of
this
permissive
or
mandatory
compact.
if
your
honor's
will
recall
that
for
four
sessions
of
congress,
senator
hayden,
representative
hayden,
senator
ashurst
had
fought
the
mighty
battle
to
protect
the
rights
of
arizona
and
the
upper
basin
had
fought
the
mighty
battle
to
protect
their
rights.
and
we
find
that
this
proceeding
now
immediately
before
the
change
in
this
--
in
the
section
4
(a)
which
changed
it
from
the
mandatory
to
a
permissive
compact.
senator
pittman
has
the
floor
and
he
says,
“well,
it
does
not
require
california
to
enter
into
that
agreement,
it
does
not
refer
arizona
into
this
agreement,
does
not
require
nevada
to
enter
into
that
agreement.”
if
they
do
not
enter
into
that
agreement,
then
we
--
will
we
have
the
[inaudible].
now
senator
hayden
all
of
a
sudden
either
understood
that
section
5
(a)
in
correlation
with
section
4
(a)
did
allocate
the
water
and
did
firmly
tie
it
down,
or
all
of
a
sudden
senator
hayden
surrendered,
ran
up
the
white
flag
and
for
naught,
went
to
years
of
hardworking
had
done.
because
he
said
this,
“mr.
president,
i
am
not
at
all
insistent
that
my
amendment
be
adopted
in
the
exact
language
in
which
it
is
offered.
the
suggestion
made
by
the
senator
from
nevada
is
entirely
satisfactory
to
me.
that
is,
that
it
should
be
permissive
instead
of
mandatory.”
mr.
pittman,
then
offered
it,
presiding
offer,
his
amendment
in
the
third
degree.
mr.
hayden:
“have
i
the
privilege
of
perfecting
my
amendment
so
as
to
carry
out
the
suggestion?
the
senator
from
nevada:
“the
senator
can
do
that.
mr.
hayden:
“that
i
am
please
to
do
that.”
we're
asked
to
believe
that
all
of
a
sudden
senator
hayden
surrendered
all
that
had
been
won
and
agreed
to
change
the
language
of
section
4
(a)
to
where
it
became
a
permissive
compact
and
all
of
a
sudden
all
of
this
language
about
dividing
the
water
was
all
out
the
window
and
remained
for
arizona,
california
and
nevada
to
start
all
over
again
and
again
work
out
an
agreement.
now,
immediately
following
that,
senator
pittman
said
this,
“mr.
president,
this
is
following,
immediately
following,
this
question
has
been
here
for
seven
years.
the
seven-states
have
been
attempting
to
reach
an
agreement.
apparently
the
senate
of
the
united
states
is
about
to
reach
an
agreement
as
to
what
ought
to
be
done.
the
senators
already
stated
exactly
what
it
thinks
about
the
water.
that
might
have
been
an
imposition
in
some
states.
why
not
leave
it
to
california
to
say
how
much
water
she
will
take;
leave
to
arizona
and
say
how
much
water
she
will
take.
it
is
because
it
happens,
to
become
a
duty
of
the
united
states
senate
to
settle
this
matter
and
that
is
a
reason.”
then
he
said
this,
“we
have
already
decided
as
to
the
division
of
the
water.
we
have
already
decided
as
to
the
division
of
the
water.”
this
is
hard
on
the
heels
of
the
permissive
change
in
the
amendment.
and
we
say
if
the
states
wish,
they
can
enter
into
a
subsidiary
agreement
confirming
that.
we
have
already
agreed
that
the
seven-state
act
shall
be
binding.
now
i
see
a
great
distinction,
if
it
please
the
court,
between
congress
in
effect
twisting
california's
arm,
a
sovereign
state
in
saying,
sign
your
name
here
or
saying,
“we've
divided
the
water.
we've
told
the
secretary
how
he's
to
handle
it.”
now,
if
the
states
were
to
confirm
it,
find.
but
we're
not
going
to
force
them
to
it
because
what's
the
difference.
that's
the
only
explanation
for
senator
hayden
throwing
up
his
hands
and
saying,
“i'm
very
happy
to
do
this.”
it's
the
only
explanation
for
the
senator
of
the
upper
basin
suddenly
deciding
that
their
peers
have
been
for
naught
and
that
they
may
now
safely
leave
to
the
division
--
leave
to
--
of
the
agreement
between
the
lower
basin
states.
now,
in
that
connection
i
would
like
to
just
ask
your
honors
to
give
some
thought
to
a
language
of
section
5
(a)
and
respect
to
section
4
(a).
it
says
shall
conform
to
section
4
(a).
that
is
rather
an
unusual
word,
“conform.”
and
other
places
where
they
wanted
to
say
shall
subject
for
the
provisions
of,
they
didn't
have
any
difficulty
in
doing
that.
but
it
said,
“shall
conform
to
the
provisions
of
section
4
(a).”
alright,
what
does
section
--
the
first
section
4
(a)
require?
what
does
it
require?
read
it;
all
it
says
is,
nothing
shall
be
done
if
california
does
these
things.
so
are
we
to
say
that
the
senate
of
the
united
states
was
saying
to
the
secretary,
“don't
let
any
contracts
until
this
act
becomes
effective.”
now
sure
you
can
shut
your
eyes
to
the
language
with
the
first
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
and
say,
“well,
i
find
it
here
somewhere”,
like
be
shuffling
the
papers
in
the
dark,
but
you
cannot
read
the
first
section
of
4
(a)
and
find
other
than,
“nothing
shall
be
done
under
this
act
unless
and
until”
one;
there
shall
be
six-state
ratification
or
seven-state
ratification.
there
shall
be
the
california
limitation
act.
the
president
shall
proclaim
it.
that's
all
that
the
first
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
says.
if
--
that
shan't
turn
a
wheel
until
these
things
have
been
done.
now,
how
was
the
secretary
are
going
to
conform
to
the
first
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
if
it
all
says
is
should
not
let
any
contract
until
you
have
authority
to
do
so.
we
don't
think
that
that's
what
it
meant.
now,
let
me
make
one
further
suggestion
that
i
abrogated
this
court
before.
in
section
8
(b),
it's
found
what
is
known
as
the
other
compact
provision.
if
your
honor's
will
recall
that
it
provides
that
the
secretary
shall
be
governed
by
such
compact
as
may
be
entered
into
by
any
--
by
the
three
states,
nevada,
california
or
arizona
or
any
two
of
them
with
respect
to
power
or
water.
then
he
says
that
if
they
do
not
compact
before
january
1,
1929
then
any
contract
the
secretary
shall
elect,
shall
take
precedence
over
the
compact
sorted
into
by
the
states.
senator
--
mr.
carpenter
in
commenting
or
testifying
as
to
the
meaning
of
that
amendment
and
its
purposes
said
this,
“it
was
the
thought
of
the
framers
of
the
amendment
to
stay
the
end
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
any
such
contracts
where
such
a
time
is
maybe
necessary
for
the
three
lower
states
to
conclude
a
compact.”
that
is
the
reason
for
the
inclusion
of
that
date
than
they
opt
further.
they
wish
to
fix
the
reasonable
time
within
which
to
arrive
at
a
compact
to
deal
with
the
waters
with
perfect
freedom.
knowing
that
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
enters
into
contracts
with
disposition
of
water
in
part
to
be
generated
that
any
compact
between
three
states
would
confirm
those
contracts
and
the
lower
states
might
be
in
the
position
to
recognizing
those
contracts,
irrespective.
in
other
words
in
section
8
(b)
where
the
congress
authorized
a
compact
departing
from
that
authorized
in
section
4
(a),
it
said
and
made
a
provi
--
a
provision
that
if
the
secretary
enters
into
any
contract
with
four
of
the
states,
so
compact,
those
shall
control,
otherwise,
there's
going
to
be
a
contract.
but
do
you
find
in
any
such
provision
in
section
4
(a)?
do
you
find
any
such
limitation
with
respect
to
what
is
to
happen
if
the
secretary's
contracts
do
not
conform
to
4
(a)?
it's
unthinkable
that
the
congress
did
not
conclude
that
the
three
states
might
not
compact
for
some
time.
so
we
say
that
there's
another
strong
firm
indication
of
the
fact
that
“conform
to”
means
shall
comply
with
the
division
we
have
suggested
because
otherwise
we
might
have
a
situation
where
the
three
states
with
compact,
the
compact
would
not
comply
with
the
secretary's
contracts
and
yet
under
the
statute
they
must
be
for
permanent
service.
so
we
say
that
again
in
section
4
(a)
you
have
a
clear
indication
that
by
conform
to
congress
meant
exactly
what
it
said
and
that
is
--
agree
with
the
disposition
we
have
authorized.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
if
i
might
for
just
a
moment
to
the
administrative
construction
referred
to
by
mr.
ely.
the
court
will
recall
that
there
was
published
in
1933
a
document
entitled
colorado
river
documents,
special
master's
exhibit
number
1a.
this
is
authored
by
then
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
mr.
wilbur,
by
his
esteemed
assistant
mr.
northcutt
ely.
i'm
reading
now
from
the
1933
edition,
it's
left
out
of
the
1933
edition.
fourth,
the
department
has
promulgated
regulations
designed
to
insure
our
water
supply
to
arizona.
these
regulations
are
included
in
an
appendix,
as
an
appendix
in
this
volume.
they
outline
the
form
of
a
hoover
water
--
dam,
water
delivery
contract
which
the
united
states
will
enter
into
with
arizona
upon
certain
conditions.
briefly,
the
contract
calls
for
the
delivery
of
2,800.000
acre-feet
and
return
for
which
arizona
undertakes
to
make
no
interference
with
the
diversions
by
other
government
contracts.
this
quant
--
this
quantity
of
water
is
adequate
for
all
of
the
arizona
projects
below
hoover
dam
and
is
without
prejudice
the
power
of
the
parties
to
contract
in
the
future
for
a
delivery
of
additional
water.
arizona
is
thus
offered
an
assurance
of
2,800,000
acre-feet
of
main
stream
water
and
given
an
opportunity
to
look
to
the
united
states
rather
than
to
an
agreement
between
the
parties.
now
this
is
the
secretary
of
the
interior
prior
to
1933
stating
what
he
thought
arizona
should
have,
and
almost
2,800,000
acre-feet
of
main
stream
water,
but
it
didn't
say
a
word
about
the
gila.
now,
much
has
been
said
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
to
carry
over.
california
themselves
in
their
seven-party
agreement
paid
no
attention
in
substance
to
priorities.
if
you'll
look
at
the
seven-party
agreement,
you
will
find
that
there
is
a
first
priority
of
treatment
of
850,000
acre-feet
of
agricultural
uses.
there
is
then
a
fourth
priority
of
550,000
acre-feet
which
adds
up
to
a
total
of
4,400,000
acre-feet,
the
very
amount
that
california
agrees
to
limit
herself
to
in
her
limitation
act.
comes
a
fifth
priority
to
the
same
[inaudible],
the
same
people,
another
550,000
acre-feet
but
for
some
reason
that's
broken
out.
that's
a
different
priority.
now,
why
the
--
the
adherence
to
4,400,000
if
california
at
time
didn't
think
that
that
was
a
breaking
point
with
respect
to
her
priorities?
secondly,
in
this
seven-party
agreement,
she
pays
no
attention
to
the
fact
the
court
shall
--
had
no
right
at
all.
shall
the
court
--
shall
had
no
appropriative
rights
at
all.
now,
i
know
that
arizona
--
that
california
had
asserted
to
the
contrary
in
her
brief
that
the
simple
facts
are
that
at
the
time
the
notice
of
appropriation
was
filed,
coachella
was
not
a
part
of
san
diego
county
but
was
a
part
of
a
different
county
and
mr.
dowd,
their
chief
witness
finally
agreed
in
cross
examination
that
was
true.
the
palo
verde
contract;
early
in
the
game,
the
palo
verde
people
wrote
to
the
secretary
and
asked
him
with
respect
to
whether
they
could
--
needed
the
contact
or
didn't.
and
he
wrote
back
and
said,
“well,
if
you
don't
need
any
storage
water,
i
guess
you
don't
need
a
contract.”
but
they
entered
into
a
contract
subsequently
and
this
is
typical
of
the
contracts
whereas
the
district
is
desirous
of
entering
into
a
contract
with
the
delivery
to
it
of
water
in
the
boulder
canyon
reservoir
and
it
is
in
the
mutual
interest
of
the
parties
hereto
that
such
contract
be
executed
and
rights
of
the
district
--
and
the
rights
of
the
district
and
into
the
waters
of
the
river
is
hereby
defined.
in
other
words,
by
this
contract,
palo
verde
agreed
that
its
rights
into
the
river
were
defined
by
this
contract
and
this
contract
calls
for
stored
water
and
nothing
but
stored
water.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
think
that
should
--
all
of
them
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
i
would
say
that
uniformly,
uniformly,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
whether
it
was
from
california
or
from
arizona
was
careful
to
say
that
what
we
do
is
not
to
be
construed
as
an
administrative
interpretation
but
nonetheless
the
facts
are
that
they
did
so
interpret
the
project
act
because
that
has
how
the
secretary
contracted.
now,
i
presume
that
there
is
no
real
reason
to
review
the
legislative
history
further
because
i
gather
from
what
mr.
justice
douglas
said
that,
that
it
has
been
viewed
carefully
that
i
certainly
don't
think
that
i
should
take
the
court's
time
to
--
reading
from
that
if
that
is
not
necessary.
now,
the
project
act
itself,
if
it
please
the
court,
fairly
interpreted
we
think,
covers
and
disposes
of
the
entire
supply
of
water
which
is
impounded
by
the
--
by
the
dam.
we
say
this
for
several
reasons.
the
first
is
that
ever
since
the
project
act
was
passed
and
dam
was
built,
there
has
been
no
attempt
whatever
to
take
this
water
in
relationship
to
natural
flow.
there
has
been
no
attempt
whatever
to
claim
this
water
relationship
to
priorities.
there
has
been
no
attempt
whatever
to
do
other
than
to
take
this
water
as
stored
water
just
as
it
was
contemplated
at
all
time
that
they
would
do.
the
project
act
itself
says
that
the
secretary
shall
manage
the
dam
and
reservoir
in
accordance
with
certain
priorities,
flood
control,
improvement
of
navigation
and
irrigation
and
the
power.
if
the
secretary
is
going
to
have
to
look
to
the
rights
of
irrigators
or
appropriators
to
determine
how
he
is
to
operate
that
reservoir
and
dam,
he's
going
to
have
some
trouble
in
following
out
the
--
the
mandate
of
congress.
but
we
don't
think
that
that
was
the
--
the
intent
of
congress
or
the
mandate
of
congress.
with
respect
to
the
provisions
of
section
18
that
have
been
referred
to,
your
honors
will
recall
that
that
provides
that
--
that
the
--
nothing
--
nothing
contained
in
the
provisions
of
that
section
shall
be
held
to
interfere
with
such
rights
as
states
have
in
the
waters
within
their
borders
or
to
enact
such
laws
and
adopt
such
policies
with
respect
to
irrigation
and
so
on
in
the
future.
to
me,
that
has
printed
on
it
in
bullet
type,
the
fact
that
the
upper
basin
state
was
saying,
“such
rights
as
we
now
have,
this
does
not
change,
either
to
present
use
of
water
or
to
prospective
uses
of
the
water.
in
other
words,
it
was
simply
another
protected
measure
which
the
upper
basin
adopted
and
required
to
say
that
nothing
in
this
act
which
is
going
to
store
this
great
body
of
water
is
to
be
in
any
way
interpreted
to
enlarge
our
obligations;
such
rights
as
we
now
have
--
we
maintained.
and
then
empty
claim
that
the
metropolitan
project
is
going
to
have
a
severe
shortage,
i
want
to
make
one
further
observation
that
at
the
time
this
act
was
passed,
california
well
knew
that.
senator
hiram
johnson
totaled
up
a
number
of
acres
which
he
said
that
they
had
the
number
of
acres
they
needed
and
then
said
--
in
other
words
california
was
willing
to
take
a
chance
in
obtaining
surplus
water.
and
on
the
further
chance
that
arizona
would
not
use
the
water
allocated
to
her,
she
would
be
indeed
establishing
--
surrendering
established
rights
in
substituting
therefore
simply
a
chance
to
obtain
water.
we
say
that
california
well
knew
the
chance
she
was
taking.
she
well
understood
it
that
she
was
going
to
perhaps
have
a
shortage.
and
nonetheless,
she
proceeded
to
agree
to
the
division.
there's
a
few
other
matters
that
i'd
like
to
discuss,
one
is
the
statement
that
mr.
ely
made
that
california
was
to
be
subject
to
a
shortage
according
to
study
made
by
the
--
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
in
fact
so,
that
this
study
was
made
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation
as
a
power
study.
the
facts
are
that
it
was
prepared
to
determine
and
support
an
average
power
rate
for
the
colorado
river
storage
project,
revenues,
repayment
as
termed
in
the
memorandum.
but
analysis
of
this
report
discloses
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1975,
when
they're
going
to
have
this
first
pinch
that
you
heard
of,
it
means
there's
going
to
be
overflowing.
it
is
going
to
be
over
30
million
acre-feet
in
the
system
all
through
that
further
study
because
it's
a
power
study,
not
a
water
study.
and
when
they
say,
metropolitan
is
going
to
be
out
of
water,
it's
going
to
be
another
--
through
the
entire
period,
30
million
acre-feet
or
thereabouts.
so
that
when
she
tells
you
that
she
has
this
problem
coming
up,
the
facts
are
that
is
related
to
a
problem
which
doesn't
exist.
now
if
i
might,
i'd
like
to
take
a
few
minutes
because
we
did
not
cover
it
fully
before
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
united
states
reservations
and
the
rights
of
the
various
federal
establishments
as
allowed
by
the
special
master.
there
are
in
effect
two
reservations
which
are
really
of
serious
consequence.
one
is
the
fort
mohave,
the
other
is
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation.
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation
consists
of
two
kinds
of
land,
75,000
acres
of
it
is
land
which
was
set
apart
by
congressional
action.
the
other
200
or
the
other
--
the
balance
between
that
and
260,000
acres
was
set
aside
by
executive
orders.
the
reservation
was
established
in
1865
and
between
then
in
1876,
it
was
enlarged
from
75,000
acres
to
260,000
acres.
the
fort
mohave
reservation
was
established
in
1870,
not
as
an
indian
reservation
at
all
but
as
a
military
reservation.
in
1882,
the
war
department
suggested
or
recommended
that
it
be
set
over
for
the
use
of
indian
children
as
an
industrial
school.
and
in
1910
and
1911
by
executive
order,
or
rather
in
1890,
this
was
done
in
1910
or
1911;
the
president
of
the
united
states
by
executive
order
added
certain
land
to
it.
during
the
course
of
the
preparation
argument
of
this
case,
other
segments
of
arizona's
economy
and
civilization
came
before
the
special
master
and
asked
for,
in
effect,
preferential
treaty.
certain
irrigation
districts
came
in
and
asked
that
their
rights
be
adjudged
without
regard
to
the
rights
of
the
rest
of
the
state
and
we
opposed
that.
we
did
it
reluctantly
and
i
say
to
this
court
in
all
sincerity
that
we
stand
here
reluctantly
opposing
the
rights
of
any
of
our
citizens
that
i
say
to
you
that
our
indians
are
not
second
class
citizens.
we're
here
to
ask
you
to
examine
this
careful
--
question
carefully
because
we
believe
that
means
a
great
deal.
we
mean
exactly
that.
we
asked
that
the
indians
be
given
everything
they're
entitled
to
but
we
ask
that
this
concept,
this
concept
of
irrigable
acres
be
examined
very
carefully.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
proper
answer
and
direct
answer
to
that
is
that
resides
within
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
under
the
arizona
contract,
the
arizona
state
legislature
has
delegated
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
right
to
contract
to
such
users
within
the
state
of
arizona
as
qualify
either
under
the
reclamation
law
or
as
to
lands
of
the
united
states.
we
accept
--
we
argue
that
before
the
special
master.
he
held
against
us
and
we
have
not
accepted
it.
so
we
say
that
therefore,
these
users
within
arizona
to
our
way
of
thinking
are
no
different
than
any
other
users.
and
i
can
think
of
no
fairer
agency
to
whom
to
entrust
the
right
to
decide
what
their
need
should
be
than
their
own
guardian.
that
is
our
position
with
respect
to
that
in
a
nutshell.
now,
if
i
might
just
briefly,
however,
because
this
decision
has
implications
far
beyond
the
--
the
right
to
these
reservations.
i
mean
this
--
this
--
the
stuff
here,
this
is
something
that
can
have
far
wider
implications.
i'd
like
first
of
all
to
direct
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
have
first
a
congressional
reservation,
and
secondly,
we
have
two
executive
orders
of
reservations.
now,
it
is
no
longer
open
as
we
see
it
to
question
that
congress
itself
can
reserve
water
of
a
navigable
stream.
if
your
honors
will
recall
that
in
nearly
case
of
pollard
versus
hagan
that
by
dicta
at
least,
the
right
of
congress
with
respect
to
water
of
a
navigable
stream
held
in
trust
for
the
future
states
and
the
territory
was
in
fact
held
nonexistent.
but
then
in
the
most
remarkable
and
outstanding
case
of
shively
versus
bowlby,
this
entire
question
was
reexamined
and
the
court
there
held
that
pollard
versus
hagan
went
too
far.
they
held
that
this
--
whatever
it
becomes
necessary
to
do
so
in
order
to
perform
international
obligations
or
to
affect
the
improvement
of
sister
--
of
such
lands
for
the
promotion
and
convenience
of
commerce
and
foreign
nations
and
among
the
several
states
or
to
carry
out
other
public
purposes
appropriate
to
the
outreach
of
which
the
united
states
holds
the
territory.
unless
in
the
case
of
some
international
duty
or
public
exigency
shall
be
held
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
future
states
and
shall
invest
in
the
several
states
when
admitted
to
the
union
with
all
the
powers
and
prerogatives
appertaining
to
the
older
states
regard
to
such
waters
and
so
on
within
their
respect
to
jurisdictions.
in
other
words,
if
it
please
the
court,
this
court
has
held
without
exception
that
water
of
a
navigable
stream
in
a
territory
while
it
is
owned
by
the
united
states
as
local
sovereign,
nonetheless
is
held
in
trust
for
future
states
under
the
constitutional
provision
that
all
states
shall
be
of
equal
dignity
and
shall
come
in
to
the
conts
--
into
the
union
with
the
rights
of
all
states.
in
other
words,
if
it
please
the
court,
with
respect
to
the
congressional
allocation,
the
congressional
--
we
concede
under
this
line
of
cases
that
that
part
does
reside
in
congress.
but,
we
also
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
congress
had
said
or
that
the
court
has
said,
it
must
be
clear,
it
must
be
shown
either
by
clearing
evidence
or
by
other
evidence
that
such
was
the
intention
of
congress.
but
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
other
reservation,
the
executive
order
reservations,
we
entertain
very
grave
doubt
as
to
whether
a
reserved
right
can
be
found
in
navigable
water
in
a
territorial
possession.
your
honors
will
recall
that
in
united
states
versus
midwest
oil,
a
question
was
presented
as
to
whether
or
not
the
executive
could
by
executive
order
withdraw
lands
which
had
been
open
to
entry.
in
other
words,
if
congress
had
opened
it
for
public
entry
and
purchase
the
executive
in
that
case
had
entered
an
order
withdrawing
those
lands
because
of
the
potential
oil
reserves
in
the,
up
to
wyoming.
the
case
was
very
bitterly
contested
and
as
i
remember
it
was
argued
three
times
and
it
written
--
the
opinion
was
written
by
justice
lamar
with
i
think
three
dissenting
opinions.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
by
long
continued
acquiescence
on
the
part
of
congress
that
it
would
find
the
delegation
of
authority
to
the
executive
to
withdraw
public
lands.
it
said
that
because
this
had
been
going
on
for
so
many
years
that
despite
the
constitutional
provision,
article
iv,
section
3,
clause
2,
i
believe
it
is
that
the
--
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
given
the
power
to
dispose
of
lands
of
united
states
and
adopt
rules
and
regulations
for
its
government
despite
that
provision,
they
would
fight
in
the
executive
the
right
to
do
this
but
they
did
so
reluctantly.
now,
such
the
record
as
you
will,
you
can
find
no
place,
we
can
find
no
place
or
has
it
ever
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
or
to
the
attention
of
the
executive
that
he
thought
he
was
reserving
water
even.
in
other
words,
you
had
in
the
midwest
oil
company
case
a
long
history
where
--
by
public
act,
the
executive
had
withdrawn
lands
from
public
entry,
that
assumed
the
prerogative
of
managing
the
government
--
the
property
of
united
states.
and
the
court
--
this
court
said,
“well,
we
find
from
that
that
power
must
exist
if
we
can't
find
otherwise,”
but
then
came
along
the
sioux
indian
case.
remember
the
sioux
tribe
versus
united
states
which
involved
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
when
the
--
they
set
aside
an
order
establishing
the
reservation,
withdrawing
it
for
reservation,
whether
or
not
it
created
a
compensable
interest.
the
court
examined
in
that
case
the
midwest
oil
--
oil
company
case
and
in
effect
it
said,
“well,
there's
no
evidence
here
that
there
ever
was
an
intention
to
create
a
compensable
interest.”
now,
in
this
case,
the
special
master
has
found
that
the
executive
had
the
right
to
establish
not
only
a
license
as
they
termed
it
in
the
midwest
oil
company
case
but
has
created
an
ownership
in
the
water
greater
--
greater
than
in
the
sioux
case
and
with
no
evidence
whatever
to
establish
it.
now,
as
we
indicated
before
in
1904,
congress
of
united
states
adopted
measures
authorizing
the
appropriation
of
money
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
an
appropriative
right
in
these
waters.
they've
continued
that
type
of
appropriation
through
1942.
in
1910,
the
secretary
of
interior
wrote
saying
they
must
do
something
about
the
fact
that
they're
getting
no
appropriation
for
these
indians
because
other
people
are
going
to
take
it
off.
in
other
words,
we
find
nowhere
--
any
indication
that
the
congress
recognized
or
appoint
--
or
the
executive
thought
that
there
was
any
reservation
of
waters.
so
we
say
one
that
with
respect
to
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation
as
to
the
75,000
acres
that
if
the
court
plans
in
the
record
clear
evidence
of
an
intent
to
reserve
it,
the
right
is
there.
we
say
with
respect
to
the
other
acres
in
which
the
executive
sought
that
to
act,
the
part
doesn't
reside
there,
it
does
not
exist.
now,
there
leaves
--
that
leaves
one
other
question
which
i
would
like
to
deal
with
and
that
is
the
further
question
of
the
reservation
by
the
special
master
of
rights
with
the
gila
national
forest.
this
is
the
forest
in
arizona,
new
mexico
and
the
gila
river.
and
again,
i
would
say
to
your
honors
that
this
involves
matters
of
so
much
greater
importance
than
this
little
dam
of
water
that
we
think
it
shouldn't
be
decided
in
this
case.
we
think
that
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
adequate
reasons
why
whether
the
congress
had
the
power
to
reserve
it
or
not
or
the
executive
had
the
power
to
reserve
it
or
not
that
they
have
clearly
shown
they
did
not
intend
to
reserve
it.
and
to
affect
the
reservation,
you
must
have
not
only
the
power
to
do
it
but
you
must
have
the
intention
to
do
it.
i
think
i'm
about
out
of
gas
and
have
a
little
time
left
in
the
running,
if
the
court
[inaudible]
recess
at
this
time
unless
the
court
--
i
will
only
take
my
seven
minutes
in
the
morning,
if
you
please.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i'm
sorry.
i
had
suggested
justice
black,
i
think
i
had
covered
my
main
argument
and
i
would
prefer
if
i
might
to
desist
at
this
time
and
resume
my
--
i
have
a
bit
--
i
have
about
seven
minutes
left.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
then
i
will
continue,
i'm
sorry
i
--
with
respect
to
the
question
of
california
and
her
claim
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
--
you
to
presume
upon
the
court.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
just
the
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
--
time
i
have
left
assuming
i
don't
--
i
mean,
assuming
i'll
left
till
--
until
2:30
i
would
have
another
seven
minutes
in
the
morning.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
it's
perfectly
--
i
perfectly
agree
with
continuing.
the
claim
has
been
made
by
california
that
the
metropolitan
district
in
effect
purchased
the
dam
and
paid
for
it.
we
have
dealt
with
that
in
our
answer
in
the
brief
at
page
133
and
followed
it.
in
that,
it
is
demonstrated
that
metropolitan
sought
not
35%
but
she
now
proudly
proclaims
that
she
so
self-sacrificingly
took
that
50%
and
she
fought
for
it.
when
she
says
therefore
that
she
paid
for
this
dam,
she
should
give
effect
to
the
fact
that
the
hydropower
she
is
now
buying
by
reason
of
this
contract
she's
getting
for
one
and
some
three
--
tenths
mills
and
something
like
that
and
the
power
she
buys
she
has
paid
six
mills
for.
so
that
when
she
says
that
she
has
paid
for
this
great
dam,
she
is
simply
saying
that,
“i
got
a
good
bargain
and
i'm
proud
of
it
but
now
i'd
like
to
turn
the
thing
the
other
way
and
have
you
consider
that
i'm
at
great
peril.”
one
of
the
questions
which
i
would
deal
with
mr.
justice
black
is
the
one
provision
of
the
master's
decree
with
which
we
were
troubled.
and
that
is
the
provision
under
which
he
permits
in
effect
other
states
to
take
water
which
one
of
the
three
lower
states
cannot
take.
in
other
words,
he
has
said
that
in
the
event,
any
state
cannot
take
water,
nothing
herein
contains
shall
be
considered
as
preventing
california
or
any
other
state
from
taking
that.
we
realize
that
it
is
inappropriate
for
anyone
to
stand
before
this
court
and
suggest
that
water
should
be
wasted.
but
our
answer
simply
would
be
that
california
at
the
time
when
the
limitation
act
was
imposed
was
in
a
position
to
take
water.
congress
knew
it
and
yet
congress
for
some
reason
refused
to
say
that
as
long
as
no
other
state
takes
this
water,
california
may
not
take
it.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
that's
a
difficult
question
to
answer
justice
goldberg
and
i
realize
in
raising
it
i'm
getting
myself
into
trouble.
but
--
it's
a
quick
way
of
putting
the
cards
in
the
table,
it
has
been
indicated
here
that
in
1946
and
1947,
arizona
sought
to
get
the
central
arizona
project
approved.
our
chief
opposition
came
from
california,
in
fact
the
opposition
of
every
project
in
the
upper
and
lower
basin
has
come
from
california.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
legally?
well,
practically
yes.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
practically
in
the
sense
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
we
would
like
to
have
a
use
for
it
and
we
would
like
to
not
run
into
too
much
opposition
in
congress
in
getting
permission
to
use
it.
the
simple
--
the
legal
answer,
if
it
please
the
court
is
this,
as
we
say
this
congress
in
the
--
in
the
execution
of
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause
stored
this
water.
congress
said
how
it
should
be
used.
this
court
had
said
time
and
again
that
it
will
not
interfere
with
the
congressional
discretion
when
it
exercises
that
power.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
plain.
in
fact
the
only
difference
in
the
phipps
amendment
which
i
referred
to
before
between
that
which
he
had
in
it
when
he
let
it
be
printed
and
when
he
introduced
it
was
he
added
the
phrase
in
referring
to
the
california
limitation,
diversion
less
return.
in
other
words,
it's
plain
that
the
congress
had
a
policy
of
--
for
some
reason
and
when
this
--
its
own
well-reasoned
discretion,
we
should
not
question
why.
i'm
saying,
this
is
all
we're
going
to
let
california
have.
now,
on
this
regard
to
change
the
plain
import
of
the
project
act,
it
says
that
no
person
shall
use
the
water
without
a
contract
and
which
says
that
the
secretary
may
not
contract
but
we
read
it
except
in
accordance
with
section
4
(a).
it's
contrary
to
the
decision
of
congress.
it
should
not
--
as
i
--
as
we
see
it,
the
matter
of
judicial
determination
but
should
be
a
matter
of
congressional
action.
in
other
words,
nothing
is
to
prevent
california
from
going
back
to
the
congress
and
saying
this
project
act
is
enacted,
isn't
a
good
act.
this
is
letting
not
the
water
be
wasted
and
therefore
we
suggest
that
it
be
amended.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
your
honor,
if
i
had
been
in
congress,
i
probably
might
have
passed
it
that
way
but
i
just
fail
to
find
that
in
the
act
is
all.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
that
no
person
to
use
water
except
by
con
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
all
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
if
this
is
a
power
of
--
power
exercised
by
congress
under
the
commerce
clause,
if
it
resides
solely
in
the
congress
to
exercise
that
power
and
if
congress
has
exercised
it
then
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
it
isn't
for
this
court
to
inquire
as
to
why,
how
or
when.
it's
purely
a
congressional
matter.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
i
presume
to
raise
it
in
this
fashion
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
the
sense
that
objections
to
the
decree
are
--
in
order
that
i
would
say
that
the
--
that
that
holds
probably
the
same
category
as
a
lot
of
the
other
things
that
have
been
argued
here
and
that
is
that
they're
simply
not
up
for
decision.
this
question
of
controversy
with
respect
to
the
tributaries,
no
controversy
at
the
present
time,
there's
no
point
in
deciding
that.
you
think
that
the
master
would
have
been
well
advised
and
he
left
it
alone
until
there's
a
controversy,
but
he
did
--
do
so
and
california
has
ceased
upon
his
advisory
opinion
with
respect
to
that
and
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
the
question
of
the
water
in
the
tributaries
your
honor?
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
what
the
master
decided
your
honor
was
a
question
as
between
individual
users
not
as
to
whether
where
the
water
went.
i
think
you'd
correct
decided
that
the
water
from
the
tributaries
went
into
the
main
stream
and
presented
the
secretary's
control
but
he
went
further
then
and
said
what
would
happen
in
the
future
between
user
a
and
b.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
[inaudible]
mr.
r.
p.
parry
you
honor,
the
special
master
said
this
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
your
honor
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
we
could
do
it
in
this
fashion
your
honor
that
we
--
we
would
have
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
your
honor
the
amount
of
water
we're
talking
about
in
the
tributaries
on
this
phase
on
is
minuscule.
we
do
not
contend
or
have
we
ever
thought
that
arizona
or
anyone
else
is
going
to
divert
out
of
the
main
stream
above
--
above
the
dam.
that's
--
that's
[inaudible]
and
we
didn't
understand
california
even
when
we
stopped
talking
about
that.
but
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
--
and
he
said
try
it.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well
i
think,
it
wouldn't
be
california,
it
would
be
the
secretary
of
war,
because
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
we
could
not
divert
under
the
--
the
project
act
we
could
not
divert.
i
think
there's
no
question
what
congress
in
authorizing
the
project
act
looked
to
the
supply
of
water
at
lee
ferry.
i
think
that
congress
set
that
water
aside
at
lee
ferry
for
the
supply
which
the
secretary
was
look
--
was
to
look
to
see
if
this
project
was
self-liquidating.
and
in
that
basis,
i
think
that
anyone
who
attempted
to
divert
from
above
the
reservoir
and
below
the
terrain
would
run
afoul
of
the
project
act,
would
run
afoul
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
and
furthermore,
to
all
public
land,
you
couldn't
get
with
any
ways
and
that's
[inaudible]
so
the
prospect
of
that
being
done
is
a
figment
of
the
imagination
and
of
no
immediate
probability
either
legally
or
practically.
thank
you.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
mr.
justice
black
and
members
of
the
court.
i'm
representing
the
state
of
nevada.
we
are
here
once
more
in
our
attempt
to,
shall
i
say,
hang
on
to
this
viable
block
of
water
which
will
determine
the
element,
development
of
the
southern
part
of
the
state.
in
the
limited
time
that
we
have
available,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
these
points.
first,
this
contract
between
the
state
of
nevada
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
for
300,000
acre-feet
of
lake
mead
storage,
and
i
emphasize
the
word
storage,
is
a
valid
and
binding
contract
which
should
be
upheld
under
whatever
theory
this
case
may
be
decided.
i
think
to
that
extent,
nevada
is
in
a
different
position
than
some
of
the
other
parties
to
this
case.
second,
we
think
that
the
master
was
entirely
correct
in
his
analysis,
resulting
in
his
decision,
that
this
figure
of
300,000
acre-feet
should
not
be
diminished
because
of
some
prior
existing
diversions
on
some
small
tributaries
which
i
will
mention
in
detail
later.
next,
that
this
contract
with
the
state
of
nevada
is
different
from
the
contract
with
the
state
of
arizona
is
a
specific
whole
contract
in
itself
and
does
not
require
any
implementation
or
addition
of
subsequent
individual
contracts
with
particular
users.
we
also
emphasize
the
point
that
because
in
the
case
of
nevada,
this
additional
stored
water
will
be
of
necessity
used
for
the
assistance
of
human
life
that
there
is
much
reason
to
use
judicial
discretion
in
placing
a
floor
under
the
amount
to
which
it
may
be
diminished
in
times
of
critical
water
shortage.
and
then
incidentally,
we
have
urged
in
our
briefs
and
were
mentioned
briefly,
it
has
been
our
opinion
over
the
long
whole
--
the
operation
of
the
river
would
be
better
if
the
court
retain
jurisdiction,
appointed
a
permanent
commission
with
an
advisory
committee
representing
the
various
individual
states
who
could
make
the
rules
and
regulations,
the
annual
allotments
and
so
forth
for
this
precious
water.
to
understand
nevada's
position,
it
is
necessary
to
look
briefly
at
the
physical
situation
which
existed
during
the
time
that
the
project
act
was
being
considered.
the
only
water
that
was
being
diverted
from
the
colorado
river
system
and
as
the
state
from
the
mainstream
during
all
of
the
discussions,
the
project
act
was
some
water
that
was
being
diverted
from
the
virgin
river
and
the
muddy
river
which
are
two
small
tributaries
that's
shown
on
the
map
behind
me
coming
in
to
the
upper
end
of
the
arm
of
the
reservoir
which
runs
north
and
south.
there
had
been
early
pioneer
settlements
in
that
area
starting
along
in
the
1970s.
principally,
people
of
the
lds
faith
would
come
down
from
salt
lake
city.
and
prior
to
the
time
that
the
project
act
was
being
considered,
they
had
diverted
all
of
the
available
water
on
those
streams
onto
the
flat
land
surrounding
them
and
had
applied
it
to
beneficial
use
and
it
is
estimated
that
that
total
consumption
there
is
a
consumptive
use
in
the
order
of
50,000
acre-feet.
that
was
not
a
part
of
the
mainstream
water
supply
at
the
time
the
project
act
was
being
considered.
it
was
a
maximum
development.
it
cannot
be
increased
in
the
future.
there
is
no
more
water
there
that
applied
in
that
way.
it
is
upon
lands
above
the
reservoir,
so
to
that
extent,
this
old
rights
in
that
corner
of
nevada
are
different
from
the
downstream
rights
in
california
and
arizona
and
that
they
cannot
be
supplied
from
storage.
they
were
supplied
by
tributary
use
prior
to
project
act.
it
will
have
to
continue
--
there
is
no
possibility
or
event
of
an
increase
of
use.
the
other
portion
of
nevada
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
think
under
any
definition
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
don't
think
how
ever
much
we
quibble
there
could
be
any
question
as
to
those
rights.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes,
muddy
river
flow
into
the
virgin,
a
few
miles
above
its
mountain,
but
now,
the
reservoir
has
backed
up
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
--
sufficiently
far
that
has
flooded
the
mouth
of
the
river
that
flow
in
separately.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
and
at
the
times
of
critical
--
when
water
is
needed
or
when
the
water
is
used,
there
is
no
water
that
flowed
in.
there
were
people,
very
assiduously
and
carefully
conserve
every
drop
of
water.
so,
when
i
say
it
flowed
in,
i
meant
the
stream
bed
in
virgin
conditions.
but
after
the
irrigation
developed,
there
was
no
water
went
in,
that
was
well-known
at
the
time
of
the
project
act
and
was
taken
into
consideration
by
every
engineer
i
think
who
studied
the
project.
the
other
portion
of
nevada
which
is
now
using
and
will
in
the
future
use,
the
mainstream
colorado
river
water
out
of
lake
mead
storage
is
the
area
that
we
call
generally
the
las
vegas
valley
that
lies
to
the
west
of
the
dam
and
the
reservoir.
these
valleys
are
in
a
high
plateau,
and
even
to,
with
the
dam
there,
it
is
necessary
by
pumps
to
lift
the
water
in
the
order
of
1200
feet
in
order
to
get
it
up
where
may
be
used.
at
the
time
of
the
project
act
and
perhaps
six
or
seven
thousand
people
in
a
dusty,
slippy
village
of
las
vegas
which
was
in
existence
because
it
was
a
railroad
division
point.
today,
that
area
is
percentage-wise,
the
fastest
growing
locality
in
the
united
states.
and
in
lieu
of
those
people,
it
is
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
pardon
me?
mr.
r.
p.
parry
the
water
is
at
least
one
of
the
necessities,
yes,
justice
douglas.
at
the
time
of
the
project
act,
the
only
water
that
was
being
used
there
came
from
an
underground
supply,
through
wells,
artesian
and
pumping.
for
many
years,
more
water
was
removed
from
that
underground
supply
than
was
annually
recharged
so
that
it
became
necessary
to
bring
in
water
from
lake
mead.
and
today,
the
area
has
a
population
of
approximately
170,000
people.
the
number
of
school
children
has
increased
50%
even
since
the
1960
census.
the
absolute
control
in
point
of
the
development
of
that
area
is
the
amount
of
water
that
nevada
will
get
out
of
lake
mead
storage.
nevada
is
unique
and
that
there
isn't
any
other
source
of
water
available
good
or
bad.
there
is
no
brackage
water
that
could
be
converted,
there's
no
seawater
that
can
be
converted.
and
the
reason
that
nevada
has
intervened
in
this
case
and
is
here
today
is
because
whatever
decree
may
be
entered
is
going
to
absolutely
determine
the
size
of
the
population
that
may
live
in
that
area.
detailed
studies
were
introduced
in
the
evidence
by
the
best
experts
that
nevada
could
obtain,
and
throughout
those
studies,
the
water
was
not
considered
as
being
available
or
used
for
irrigation
of
crops
as
we
ordinarily
know
it
because
it
is
too
valuable.
and
all
estimates
of
the
requirements
and
the
needs
were
based
upon
use
for
domestic
purposes
using
that
word
in
the
broadest
sense
is
also
including
industrial
uses
and
of
course
the
growth
of
shrubs
and
lawns
and
things
of
that
sort
around
the
homes.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
precisely.
we
feel
that
unless
we
have
a
decree
that
sustains
the
validity
of
this
contract
for
storage
that
the
economic
future
is
so
unstable
that
it
is
difficult
to
plan.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
the
way
we
put
it
is
that
if
there
was
one
thing
that
was
fixed
and
determined
throughout
this
lengthy,
legislative
history
which
has
been
referred
to
at
length
and
briefs
and
at
arguments
and
so
forth
was
that
nevada
was
to
have
300,000
acre-feet.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
that
is
correct.
that
that
was
irreducible
minimum
and
no
one
ever
seemed
to
quarrel
about
that
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
california
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
that
is
correct
and
by
applying
their
priority
and
limitation
act
and
they
say
that
nevada
should
have
a
total
of
--
in
the
order
of
120,000
acre-feet
of
water
and
no
more.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
we
have
agreed
at
the
pro
rata
reduction
with
one
exception
as
i
mentioned.
we
believe
that
when
you
go
into
the
field
of
applying
this
pro
rata
reduction
then
there
is
the
use
of
judicial
discretion
and
that
there
is
much
reason
for
putting
a
floor.
we've
suggested
somewhere
around
200,000
acre-feet
or
something
below
which
nevada
should
not
be
reduced
because
our
use
is
going
to
be
to
sustain
human
life.
now,
if
you
have
an
irrigation
project
and
it's
reduced,
well
you
can
reduce,
cut
down
the
crops
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
but
with
us,
it
is
a
very
real
problem
that
time.
now,
the
best
experts
--
mr.
r.
p.

yes.
mr.
r.
p.

of
all
perfected
uses
--
mr.

prior

mr.

will
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes.
that
is
the
controversy
between
nevada
and
the
unites
states
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
we
did
sign
contracts.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
no.
not
on
the
tributaries.
no,
there
are
no
contracts
covering
the
water
out
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
that
is
correct.
we
have
two
--
i
might
clear
that
up.
we
have
two
contracts
for
water
out
of
lake
mead.
there
was
a
contract
made
in
march
of
1942
and
this
bears
on
another
issue
and
i
can
cover
them
at
the
same
time
between
the
united
states
acting
through
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
state
of
nevada,
a
body
politic
and
corporate
and
its
colorado
river
commission,
said
commission
acting
in
the
name
of
the
state
by
that
principle
in
its
own
behalf
as
well
as
in
behalf
of
the
state.
and
this
term
‘state'
as
used
in
this
contract
being
deemed
to
be
both
the
state
of
nevada
and
its
colorado
river
commission,
and
that
1942
contract
was
for
100,000
acre-feet
of
water
with
no
reference
to
any
reduction.
in
1944,
in
january,
a
supplemental
contract
was
entered
into
which
changed
only
paragraph
of
the
1942
contract
but
it
did
provide
that
the
secretary
should
deliver
to
the
state
each
year
including
all
other
waters
diverted
for
use
within
the
state
of
nevada
from
the
colorado
river
system,
the
amount
necessary
to
supply
300,000
acre-feet.
now,
that
is
the
time
and
those
were
the
words
that
were
inserted
in
that
contract
which
changed
the
300,000
acre-feet
that
until
that
time,
everyone
and
i'm
sure
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
senator
pittman
who
was
a
leading
exponent
of
this
project
legislation
and
all,
all
of
a
sudden
by
the
insertion
of
those
three
words
--
are
those
words,
the
300,000
was
reduced
to
250,000.
and
that
nebraska
or
rather
nevada
has
contested
throughout
this
hearing.
we
urge
that
it
was
ultra
vires,
that
it
was
on
the
part
of
the
state
officials
and
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
and
we
of
course
concur
in
the
master's
argument
as
to
why
i
think,
he
thinks
it's
improper
which
i
will
not
repeat
at
this
time.
we
have
one
other
controversy
with
the
united
states
which
was
not
mentioned
in
this
argument
that
was
mentioned
in
the
prior
argument
and
in
the
briefs
and
that
is
as
to
whether
there
should
be
separate
contracts
in
addition
to
the
basic
one
with
the
state
of
nevada
was
users
of
water.
and
there,
i
think,
the
confusion
arose
because
of
the
difference
between
the
nevada
contract
and
the
arizona
contract
was
not
pointed
out.
the
arizona
contract
is
as
mr.
ely
said
rather
in
agreement
with
the
state
of
arizona
that
they
would
in
the
future
enter
into
other
contracts
with
water
users.
but
distinctly
different
from
that,
the
nevada
contract
is
a
specific
contract
with
the
state
of
nevada
using
the
words
that
i
read
and
throughout
practically
every
paragraph
of
the
contract
if
it
is
recited
that
the
state
will
do
this,
the
state
will
receive
the
water,
the
state
will
construct
the
means
of
diverting
it,
the
state
will
pay
for
it,
and
the
whole
setup
is
a
state
action
through
this
colorado
river
commission
which
was
created
by
the
statute,
the
state
of
nevada
is
an
appendix
in
our
opening
brief.
it
has
every
power
and
authority
that
any
irrigation
district
or
anything
else
that
could
be
created
and
as
i've
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
pardon
me?
mr.
r.
p.
parry
under
the
nevada
state
law.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
yes.
and
the
purpose
and
the
reason
for
creating
the
colorado
river
commission
was
to
have
an
orderly
disposition
of
the
water
so
there
wouldn't
be
a
scramble
for
it
and
so
we
would
get
the
optimum
development
of
the
area
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
not
that
i
know
of.
there
has
been
the
technical
point
raised
that
there
should
be
this
individual
contracts.
we
don't
know
what
that
means
whether
every
man
who
has
a
tap
and
uses
water
has
to
have
a
contract
for
whom
it
is
but
this
commission
is
proceeding
rapidly
for
planning
the
development
of
the
area
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
made
arrangements
to
set
over
to
the
state
of
nevada,
a
body
of
land
in
the
adjoining
el
dorado
valley
which
adjoins
the
las
vegas
valley
for
development
with
this
water
through
this
state
commission
and
has
authorized
studies
by
the
bureau
of
the
reclamation
for
the
development
of
this
area.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
about
20,000
or
25,000
acre-feet
of
lake
mead
water
at
present
time
are
being
diverted
in
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
it
is
distributed
through
a
body
known
as
the
las
vegas
water
district
which
in
a
sense,
it's
mingled
into
the
domestic
water
supply
system
of
the
area,
a
part
of
which
comes
from
underground
wells,
apart
from
this,
with
--
and
then
there
is
one
exception
to
that,
the
united
states
during
the
war
built
a
tremendous
installation
called
the
henderson
magnesium
plant
which
is
now
been
turned
over
to
private
hands
and
is
a
great
chemical
complex
cost
in
between
$200
to
$300
million
and
water
goes
direct
to
that
complex.
the
united
states
government
built
the
first
pump
and
pipeline
out
of
the
reservoir.
that
assists
and
purchased
from
the
united
states
by
this
commission
and
other
lines
installed.
and
they
are
--
and
plans
are
presently
on
their
way
for
greatly
expanding
that
use
of
water.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
the
evidence
in
the
record
showed
that
by
the
year
2000,
we
picked
that
up
just
as
a
test
year,
that
we
would
need
more
than
500,000
acre-feet
of
water
if
the
orderly
development
went
on.
so
our
present
estimate
is
that
the
300,000
will
be
consumed
in
the
next
few
decades
and
some
of
it
additionally
of
what
we
can
divert
with
our
present
facilities
is
going
to
be
needed
badly
in
the
next
few
years.
and
that
is
one
reason
that
from
perhaps
narrow
point
of
view
of
the
state
of
nevada
that
this
--
we
think
this
is
a
justiciable
controversy
is
that
we
must
know
as
a
matter
of
practicality
the
extent
of
nevada's
contract
for
water.
because
just
as
in
the
evidence
showed
in
the
case
of
the
metropolitan
water
district,
the
basic
pumping
clients,
the
basic
tunnels
and
installations
of
that
sort
should
be
for
economical
reasons
built
to
eventually
supply
the
maximum
amount
at
the
time
they
are
built.the
individual
pipelines
may
come
in
from
time
to
time.
if
california
is
correct
and
180,000
acre-feet
is
to
be
taken
away
from
us
that
is
the
water
for
about
a
half
a
million
people
under
the
best
analysis
an
acre-foot
of
water
will
supply
the
annual
consumption
of
about
three
people
in
that
arid
region.
and
there
is
a
precise
and
definite
question
there
which
it
would
seem
to
us
that
all
responsible
people
should
decide.
and
i
also
concur,
of
course,
in
other
broader
argument,
there
is
a
justiciable
controversy
here
as
to
the
extent
of
this
rapidly
growing
southwest
region
and
all
of
which
will
in
a
sense
be
under
a
cloud
of
suspicion
unless
there
is
a
determination
of
this
water
allocation.
the
--
in
the
brief,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
case
might
be
simplified
this
way,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
under
the
project
act,
just
for
the
moment
ignoring
all
the
language
of
it,
under
the
long
line
decisions
of
this
court,
starting
with
the
appalachian
case
and
going
down
through
the
twin
city
power
case.
certainly,
when
he
came
in
and
took
over
the
river
which
has
been
facetiously
called
the
red
river
which
is
an
actual
thing
under
the
control
of
the
united
states,
he
took
over
all
of
the
water
rights
regardless
of
what
was
there
before.
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
exemption
of
the
present
perfected
rights,
controlled
also
by
the
california
limitation,
i
do
not
believe
any
attorney
could
argue
to
this
court
but
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
all
the
water
rights
in
the
river.
also,
under
the
ivanhoe
case
and
other
cases,
having
that
control
and
having
impeded
the
flow
of
the
river,
counted
it
in
the
reservoir,
created
it
into
storage
then
he
had
the
right
to
dispose
of
that
by
contract.
and
i
believe
that
those
broad
principles
will
go
a
long
way
towards
solving
many
of
these
rather
specious
points
that
have
been
argued
at
length
in
this
tremendous
record.
in
the,
in
the
long
run,
that's
the
question,
what
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
we
think
that
under
the
overall
setup
in
the
project
act
that
the
master
was
correct
in
determining
that
there
was
a
statutory
allocation
to
the
states.
and
that
in
the
case
of
the
state
of
nevada,
the
state
created
a
statutory
body
and
is
contracted
for
and
is
paying
for
that
water,
and
subject
only
to
the
overall
rule
which
i
think
pervades
throughout
the
whole
west
that
the
water
may
not
be
wasted.
and
that
should
be
applied
to
a
beneficial
use
then
in
our
opinion,
the
state
of
nevada
has
the
right
to
make
those
decisions.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
the
con
--
the
secretary
did
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
so
i
think
that's
a
moot
question
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
and
i'm
not
dodging
the
question.
i
would
say
--
i
would
answer
in
affirmative,
yes.
that
in
view
of
the
whole
legislative
history
and
of
the
whole
act
that
the
state
was
in
the
position
and
was
willing
to
enter
into
a
firm
contract
as
it
did.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
well,
california
had
these
present
perfected
rights
in
the
name
of
various
entities
which
exceeded
their
limitation.
so
there
was
a
different
question
presented
there.
mr.
r.
p.
parry
as
to
arizona,
my
answer
would
be
in
the
affirmative.
and
the
--
mr.
r.
p.
parry
i
spell
it
out
of
two
things.
i
think
that
we
must
not
ignore
the
basic
rights
of
the
united
states
when
it
comes
in
and
takes
physical
control
of
a
navigable
stream.
it
seems
to
me
if
there
is
anything
established
in
the
law
of
the
land
now
and
that
--
and
i
say
that
regardless
of
what
all
the
senators
said
to
the
contrary
when
they
are
arguing
about
this
act.
what
they
said
four
years
ago
has
but
little
resemblance
to
the
law
of
that
type
of
river
as
it
has
been
announced
by
this
court
since
that
time.
when
we
start
from
that
premise
then
i
believe
that
we
have
a
sound
foundation
upon
which
we
can
find
in
the
project
act,
allocation
of
the
type
that
the
master
found.
i
believe
that
overall,
he
did
an
extraordinary
job.
as
i
comment
before,
nevada
came
in
as
an
intervenor,
so
to
speak,
not
wanting
to
be
squeezed
between
