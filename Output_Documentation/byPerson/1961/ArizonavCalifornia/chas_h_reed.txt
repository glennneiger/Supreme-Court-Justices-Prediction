mr.
chas.
h.

it
is
my
purpose
to
discuss
and
review
the
claims
asserted
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
for
its
federal
establishments.
arizona
is
naturally
concerned
both
from
the
standpoint
that
such
water
is
charged
against
the
total
entitlement
or
allotment
that
goes
to
the
state
of
arizona,
also
because
substantial
quantities
of
water
are
involved
in
an
area
which
is
in
short
supply
of
water.
the
claims
asserted
by
the
united
states
in
this
litigation
aggregated
a
total
diversion
of
water
both
mainstream
and
tributary,
of
an
excess
of
1,360,000
acre-feet
per
annum
which
would
roughly
equal
a
consumptive
use
of
an
excess
of
some-700,000
acre-feet
per
year.
with
respect
to
claims
on
tributary
waters,
the
master
held
that
none
of
such
claims
presented
a
judicial
--
a
justiciable
controversy
except
with
respect
to
the
tributary
of
the
gila
river.
the
rights
in
that
stream
were
adjudicated
and
the
master
did
submit
a
recommended
disposal
or
disposition
of
the
rights
in
those
waters.
in
addition,
the
master
upheld
the
claims
asserted
by
the
united
states
as
to
mainstream
federal
establishments.
the
amount
of
water
allowed
or
recommended
for
those
mainstream
federal
establishments
aggregate
a
total
diversion
per
year
of
818,801
acre-feet
which
roughly
would
amount
to
a
consumptive
use
in
the
neighborhood
of
420,000
acre-feet
per
year.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
the
million
odd
figures,
1,360,000,
i
can
give
it
to
you
precisely,
1,361,231,
that
is
the
amount
of
water
that
would
required
to
be
diverted
if
all
the
claims
asserted
by
the
united
states
were
allowed.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
no,
in
arizona.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i'm
confining
myself
to
the
claims
made
against
waters
in
--
within
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
in
a
moment
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
in
a
moment,
i
plan
to
do
that.
our
concern
is
not
lessened
by
the
fact
that,
in
this
litigation,
the
united
states
for
the
first
time,
so
far
as
i
know,
has
broadened
its
claim
of
ownership
of
water
to
include
navigable
waters
in
the
public
land
states.
hereto
fore,
and
i
believe
for
about
a
half-a-century,
the
united
states
has
urged
upon
this
court
that
it
accept
the
principle
that
it
owns
all
the
unappropriated,
non-navigable
water
within
the
public
land
states.
so
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the
first
time
that
that
claim
has
been
extended
to
include
the
navigable
waters
within
the
public
land
states
as
well.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
to
include
navigable
waters.
in
other
words,
the
assertion
of
ownership
in
a
proprietary
sense
by
the
united
states
is
now
made
against
not
only
the
non-navigable
waters
within
the
public
land
states,
but
the
navigable
waters
as
well.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
i
assume
just
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
just
as
they
own
the
public
lands,
as
i
understand
their
position.
in
no
sense,
a
sovereign
capacity
except
the
government's
ownership
of
property
of
course,
is
not
the
same
as
an
individual's.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
the
government
so
considers
it
and,
in
fact,
so
says
in
its
answering
brief
that,
without
the
ownership
of
those
waters,
the
government
would
have
been
powerless
to
reserve
or
set
aside
these
waters.
to
give
the
court
an
idea
and
quickly
of
what
this
means
so
far
as
arizona
and
other
public
land
states
are
concerned,
i'll
first
take
up
the
situation
that
exists
in
arizona.
i'm
not
going
to
bore
you
with
figures.
our
figure
is
the
only
way
--
figures
are
the
only
way
in
which
i
know
to
make
this
clear.
within
arizona,
the
total
land
area
is
72,688,000
acres.
of
that
72
million
plus
acres
within
the
state,
54,066,080
belong
to
the
united
states
or
74-3/10%
of
all
the
lands
within
the
state
of
arizona.
some-9,000
acres
are
owned
by
the
state
of
arizona.
likewise,
some-9,000
plus
are
in
private
ownership,
the
lands
in
private
ownership
in
the
states
being
only
approximately
13%
of
the
total
area.
now,
the
total
lands
owned
by
the
united
states
within
arizona,
they
have
been
withdrawn
or
reserved
so
that
they
no
longer
occupy
the
status
of
public
lands,
that
this
lands
which
maybe
disposed
of
and
private
interests
required.
those
public
lands
constitute
only
roughly
24%
of
the
government's
total
holdings
in
the
state.
in
other
words,
there
has
already
been
withdrawn
and
reserved
and
placed
in
a
withdrawn
category
a
little
more
than
75%
of
the
lands
which
the
government
owns
in
the
state.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
under
the
power
to
remove
them
from
the
category
of
public
lands
which
are
open
to
acquisition
of
title
and
rights
by
private
individuals.
the
distinction
has
long
been
recognized.
it's
referred
to
in
the
pelton
dam
case.
it
forms
one
of
the
distinctions
and
basis
for
the
holding
in
that
case
by
this
court.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
unless
those
withdrawals
are
in
some
fashion
cancelled
and
the
land
restored
to
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
the
category
of
public
lands.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
in
each
instance.
i
have
the
figures.
i
hesitate
the
use
the
time
to
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
relate
them.
roughly,
the
amount
withdrawn
for
any
of
the
reservations
is,
in
excess,
21
million
acres.
the
next
largest
category
is
forest

the
national
forest,
some-11,381,000
acres.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
have
no
category
in
that
capacity.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
no,
your
honor.
i'll
roughly
give
you
the
category
so
you
know
what
we're
talking
about.
the
bureau
of
land
management
is
the
agency
now
in
charge
of
the
public

lands
that
are

mr.

was

on
my
part
to
be

h.

corps
of
engineers
19,000,
indian

as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,

so
that
the
total
lands
held
by
the
federal
government
in
arizona,
which
themselves
are
--
aggregate
74%
of
all
lands
in
arizona
but,
of
those
federal
lands,
over
75%
have
been
withdrawn
to
not
occupy
the
state
as
public
lands
and
are
not,
at
this
moment
at
least,
subject
to
the
acquisition
of
private
or
individual
rights
therein.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
i'll
explain
to
your
honor
why
i'm
mentioning
these
figures
in
a
moment.
i
don't
suppose
there's
anything
this
court
couldn't
do
for
that
matter.
the
impact
of
the
claim
of
the
united
states
owns
all
waters,
both
navigable
and
non-navigable,
in
the
public
land
states.
on
those
public
land
states,
i
think
i
can
briefly
indicate,
by
these
statistics
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
no,
it
means
the
states
of
arizona,
california,
colorado,
idaho,
montana,
nevada,
new
mexico,
north
dakota,
oregon,
south
dakota,
washington,
wyoming,
and
utah.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
because
the
government,
when
it
acquired
those
lands
from
the
preceding
sovereignty,
became
the
owner
of
all
the
lands
within
those
states.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right,
and
held
them
during
territorial
status.
upon
that
fact
is
predicated
the
claim
which
the
united
states
asserts
as
to
ownership
of
water,
the
fact
that
it
owned
the
land,
but
i
had
planned
to
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
have
i
made
myself
clear?
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
now,
the
total
acreage
in
those
public
land
states
that
i
have
just
enumerated
is
in
excess
of
418
million
acres.
of
that
amount,
there
has
been
withdrawn,
so
there's
now
--
does
not
occupy
the
status
of
public
lands
by
the
federal
government,
240
million-plus
acres.
in
addition,
there
are,
in
the
category
of
public
lands
within
the
public
lands
states,
some-177
million
acres.
now,
so
much
for
the
statistics,
if
we
can
turn
now
to
the
drawing
at
my
back,
perhaps
i
can
make
clear
what
particular
federal
establishments
we
are
dealing
with
and
which
--
for
which
the
master
recognized
he's
right.
and
if
you
will
start
with
the
colorado
river
indian
restoration,
to
point
out
the
location,
the
area
--
total
area
of
that
reservation
is
some-260,000
acres.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
that
is
an
enlargement
of
the
government's
exhibit.
the
government,
itself,
plan
to
use
this
in
its
oral
argument
and
very
kindly
offered
us
the
use
of
it.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
believe
not
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
believe
not.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
you
ask
exhibit
100?
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
now,
that
reservation
was
established
by
act
of
congress
in
setting
aside
75,000
acres.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
colorado
river.
that's
the
largest
reservation
and
the
largest
use
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
involved
and
i
st
--
for
that
reason,
i
start
with
it.
it
was
subsequently
expanding
by
executive
orders
to
reach
its
present
total
of
some-260,000
acres.
the
total
tribal
population
of
the
colorado
river
tribes,
that
is,
that
means
all
there
are
on
the
roads,
regardless
of
where
they
live,
on
the
reservation
or
off
the
reservation,
even
out
of
arizona
or
even
abroad.
that
total
tribal
population
is
1,300.
i
might
explain
to
your
honors
that
there
was
no
tribe
of
indians
known
as
the
colorado
river
tribe.
that
name
comes
from
the
fact
that
that
reservation
was
created
and
some
of
the
indians
have
settled
to
form
the
tribal
organization
on
that
reservation
and
are
now
known
by
that
name.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
oh
yes,
1865,
it
was
created,
the
original
75,000
acres.
all
of
the
executive
orders
antedate
statehood.
in
fact,
there's
only
one
reservation,
indian
reservation
known
to
the
mainstream
that
does
not
and
that
is
the
cocopah
reservation,
which
we'll
come
to
in
a
moment.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
will
give
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
in
order
to
give
the
correct
answer,
perhaps
i
should
detail
a
little
bit
what
the
situation
was.
the
indian
agent
by
the
name
of
poston,
who
later
was
elected
to
congress
for
the
territory,
met
with
the
indians
of
five
tribes,
either
in
1963
of
1964
--
1863
or
1864,
i
forgot
which.
now,
those
tribes
were
the
yumas,
the
mohaves,
the
yavapais,
the
hualapais
and
the
chemehuevis.
it
was
estimated,
and
only
an
estimate
of
the
total
population
of
those
five
tribes,
some-10,000
indians.
subsequent
events
have
shown
that
estimate
to
be
somewhat
excessive,
quite
a
bit
excessive.
poston,
through
the
interior
department,
recommended
that
those
five
tribes
which,
for
the
most
part,
had
traditionally
lived
somewhere
in
that
area
along
the
river
be
given
a
reservation
so
that
they
could
call
that
their
home
and
that
they
take
up
agricultural
pursuits
and
farm
such
of
the
reservation
land
as
was
needed
to
establish
an
agricultural
economy.
the
success
of
that
effort
i
had
planned
or
plan,
i
should
say,
i
had
expected
to
discuss
later.
that
is
the
background
of
it.
i
might
say
briefly
that
only
one
branch
of
the
mohaves
and
some
chemehuevis,
for
the
main
part,
had
taken
advantage
of
that
offer.
and,
in
fact,
for
each
of
those,
as
well
as
the
other
indian
tribes
in
arizona
and
california,
there
has
been
another
separate
and
distinct
reservation
created
which
is
the
home
or
abode
of
the
various
tribes.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right,
your
honor.
now,
of
the
total
tribal
population
of
some-1,300,
the
evidence
did
not
permit
--
of
a
finding
as
to
the
exact
number
which
actually
resides
and
live
on
the
reservation
and
make
their
home
there.
the
master
estimated
it
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
1,100-1,200
but
that
is
merely
an
estimate.
unfortunately,
the
evidence
was
not
presented
in
this
case
with
respect
to
any
--
well,
i'll
modify
that,
with
respect
to
any
of
the
mainstream
reservations
as
to
the
number
of
indians
actually
living
on
the
reservation,
so
that
the
figures
i
give
you
here
include
those
who
may
be
falling
away
to
economy
or
some
other
occupation
elsewhere.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
they
wouldn't
be
meaningful
and
i
wouldn't
be
taking
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
--
the
court's
time
with
them.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right,
in
ascertaining
what
is
a
just
and
proper
amount
of
water
for
those
indians
and
for
those
reservations.
now,
the
number
of
indians
actually
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
not
at
all,
as
i
--
so
far
as
i
can
see,
not
all.
i'm
quite
sure
but
--
the
number
of
indians
actually
farming
the
colorado
reservation
lands
in
1951
were
276.
by
the
year
1957,
which
is
the
last
year
of
record,
that
had
dwindled
to
148
indians
who
were
actually
farming
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation
lands.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that
is
a
matter
that's
in
dispute,
your
honor.
i
think
a
fair
answer
is
that
it
is
increasing
somewhat
slightly.
and
the
government
will
not
agree
with
that
and
thinks
it's
rapidly,
and
it's
part
of
the
population
explosion,
as
it's
called
in
arizona.
we
don't
view
it
that
way.
as
i
say,
unfortunately,
the
evidence
was
never
made
available
throughout
the
course
of
the
trial
so
that
you
could
really
get
your
teeth
in
the
subject.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
no.
no
your
honor.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
only
in
this
fashion,
your
honor,
and
the
government
did
introduce,
or
i'm
not
sure
whether
this
particular
exhibit
was
--
it
might
have
been
introduced
by
california
with
mark
at
least
for
identification
by
the
government,
had
figures
as
to
the
total
tribal
population
of
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation.
i
forget
the
number
of
the
exhibit.
i'll
supply
it
in
a
moment.
going
back
to
the
preceding
section,
quite
obviously,
those
figures
are
not
meaningful
because
they
will
show,
for
instance,
a
neighborhood
of
10,000
in
one
year
and
the
next
year
drop
down
to
700
with
nothing
to
account
for
it.
it's
just
different
criterion,
different
methods
obviously
were
used.
that
may
not
be
true
as
to
the
later
years
but,
so
far
as
i
know,
there's
no
truly
reliable
evidence
upon
which
the
court
could
predicate
any
specific
finding
either
as
to
the
rate
of
growth,
the
trend
of
living
on
or
living
off
of
the
reservation,
certainly
nothing
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
water
used
by
indians
or
their
needs
for
individual
or
for
family,
none
of
that
was
going
on
into
that
was
presented.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
this
is
colorado?
i'll
have
to
get
that
cleared,
your
honor.
now,
on
the
colorado
indian
reservation,
as
a
result
largely
of
the
construction
of
headgate
rock
diversion
dam,
authorized
by
an
act
of
congress
in
1935,
there
had
been,
at
one
time
or
another
but
never
at
any
one
time,
subjugated
and
irrigated
on
that
reservation
approximately
40,000
acres,
not
all
by
indians
but
some
portion
of
it
being
by
white
lessees
or
non-indian
lessees.
the
total
amount
farmed
on
that
reservation,
total
acreage
in
1953,
was
29,534.
of
that
total
acreage,
some-18,719
in
that
year
was
farmed
by
the
indians
themselves
and
10,000
plus
the
balance
by
non-indian
lessees.
in
1954,
practically
the
same
amount
of
acreage
was
cultivated,
a
little
larger,
29,957
but
the
indians
that
year
only
farmed
15,153
and
the
non-indian
lessees
framed
over
14,000
or
14,804
acres.
in
1955,
which
is
the
last
year
of
record,
of
the
29,271
acres
farmed
on
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation,
only
14,512
were
farmed
by
indians
and
by
non-indian
lessees
14,759
or
more
than
being
farmed
by
the
indians
themselves.
one
other
fact
i
think
is
pertinent
with
respect
to
that
reservation,
and
that
is
that
the
constructed
works
built
there
by
the
government
are
capable
of
serving
some-60,000
acres
with
the
addition
only
of
laterals
and
subjugation
of
the
land.
it
would
require
no
extension
of
the
main
canal.
the
diverting
structure
itself
has
a
carrying
capacity
sufficient
for
the
irrigation
of
105,000
acres.
now,
for
that
reservation,
the
recommended
decree
presented
to
this
court
finds
in
arizona
99,375
acres
of
irrigable
lands,
in
california
some-800
--
8,213
acres
or
a
total
of
107,000
plus
acres
of
irrigable
lands.
the
master
recommended
that
those
lands
have
a
diversion
right
from
the
mainstream,
that
is
the
arizona
portion,
of
662,402
acre-feet
per
year
or
roughly
a
consumptive
use,
although
it
was
not
couched
in
that
language,
of
some-330,000
acre-feet
per
year
for
the
ind
--
for
the
arizona
portion
of
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation.
on
the
california
side,
he
recommended
a
diversion
right
of
54,000-plus
acre-feet
per
year
which
would
equal
a
or
result
in
the
consumptive
use
of
some-27,000.
so,
the
total
consumptive
use
of
that
reservation
per
year
would
be
358,589
or
at
least
it
would
be
--
the
water
would
be
available
for
consumptive
use
if
the
land
was
ever
used
to
that
extent.
the
diversion
requirement
would
be
some-770,000
acre-feet
per
year.
i'm
going
to
pass
on
quickly
to
the
other
reservation,
the
fort
mohave
indian
reservation,
that
includes
an
area
of
roughly
some-31,000
acre-feet
--
1,000
acres.
that
was
just
originally
set
aside
as
the
military
reserve
for
military
purposes
in
1870.
it
was
transferred
to
the
department
of
interior
on
september
18,,
1890
for
the
purpose
of
an
industrial
training
school
for
indian
youth.
subsequent
the
executive
orders,
it
expanded
the
area
to
include
additional
lands.
the
total
of
lands
ever
irrigated
on
that
reservation,
the
largest
amount
was
23
acres
in
the
vicinity
of
the
indian
school.
the
evidence
shows
that,
although
they
are
on
the
tribal
roads,
some-450
mohave
indians,
actually
only
one
family
lives
on
the
nevada
portion
of
the
reservation,
none
on
the
arizona
or
california
portion.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
no,
the
school
had
been
abandoned
quite
some
time
ago.
the
23
acres
are
no
longer
being
irrigated.
there's
no
irrigation.
there
are
no
irrigation
facilities.
i
will
go
into
that
more,
later.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
770
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
your
honor.
that's
due
to
the
fact
that
it's
--
of
course
a
budding
initiation
to
their
river
in
there
would
be
a
large
return
flow.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
the
diversion
was
computed
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
in
this
way,
an
amount
sufficient
to
meet
what
the
master
concluded
was
the
consumptive
use
requirement.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
the
first
had
consumptive
use
in
his
draft
--
figures
in
his
draft
report.
i'm
certainly
arose
as
to
whether
those
figures
were
in
terms
of
diversion
less
return,
as
had
been
adopted
throughout
the
balance
of
the
report
and
that,
for
that
reason,
he
abandoned
that
approach
and
put
it
in
terms
of
diversion
right
plus
the
right
for
whatever
quantity
of
water
was
needed
for
the
proper
irrigation
of
the
number
of
acres
he
specified,
or
whichever
was
the
lesser
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
--
of
the
two.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
don't
want
to
mislead
your
honor.
331,000
acre
figure
is
a
calculated
figure
which
is
based
in
this
way.
there
was
evidence
introduced
by
california
as
to
consumptive
use
on
that
reservation
in
terms
of
diversion
less
return.
as
i
recall,
it
was
3.58
acre-feet
per
acre.
we
simply
multiplied
that
times
the
number
of
irrigable
acres,
and
not
irrigable
acres,
and
got
that
amount.
the
master
made
no
finding
with
respect
to
that.
as
i
say,
the
question
arose
as
to
the
reliability
of
the
figures
or
not
reliability
but
where
they
actually
were
in
terms
of
diversion
less
return.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
oh,
yes.
for
instance,
the
fort
mohave
isn't
the
outstanding
example
of
that.
they
are
--
the
diversion
requirement
for
that
reservation,
as
set
by
the
master,
would
be
122,648
acre-feet.
no
indians,
except
the
one
family
and
i'm
not
sure
of
that
family
but
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
and
with
the
right
to
consumptively
use
or
which
diversion
would
result
in
a
consumptive
use
of
an
excess
of
60,000
acre-feet
a
year.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that
is
the
result,
whether
ever
used
or
not.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well
i
--
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
that
situation
could
ever
develop
because
you
can't
finance
the
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
project.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
didn't
so
understand
that
decision.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
all
we
could
go
by
is
the
master's
--
what
he
says
in
his
report.
the
basis
of
his
recommendation
is
this,
that
when
these
reservations
were
created,
the
united
states
intend
for
the
indians
to
live
on
them
and
to
follow
a
farming
way
of
life.
he
also
said
that
it's
not
to
be
expected
that
those
indians
would
remain
static
or
die
up.
in
a
natural
course
of
events,
the
population
should
increase.
someday
in
the
unforeseeable
future,
they
may
reach
the
number
where
they
will
require
all
the
irrigable
acres
on
that
reservation.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
no,
your
honor.
i
think
we
would
have
to
concede
that
during
territorial
status,
when
the
united
stated
was
the
local
or
municipal
sovereign
as
well
as
the
national
sovereign,
that
it
had
the
power
or
disposal
of
those
waters.
i
think
the
cases
which
i
had
planned
to
come
to
after
a
while
show
that
that
--
there
is
a
presumption
against
that
disposal.
also,
that
--
with
respect
to
that
property
which
the
government
holds
in
a
trust
capacity
for
the
future
states,
there
is
a
presumption
against
the
invasion
of
that
trust,
if
i
can
express
it
in
that
language,
s
--
and
that
there
must
be
a
clear
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
make
any
disposal
of
naval
water
for
the
reason.
one,
that
it
holds
it
in
trust
for
the
beneficiary
state
and
the
trustee
is
not
supposed
to
use
trust
property
for
his
own
ends
to
accomplish
his
own
ends
and
equally
important,
and
maybe
more
important,
is
that
to
the
extent
that
those
waters
are
disposed
of,
the
full
sovereignty
of
the
future
state
is
contracted
and
diminished
so
that
it
cannot
become
a
member
of
the
union
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
older
states.
those
principles
of
law,
i
think,
are
quite
important
in
arriving
at
what
was
the
congressional
intent.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
i
haven't
really
meant
to
argue
it
at
all.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
trying
to
get
the
actual
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
is
that
your
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
can
give
your
honor
that
argument
now.
i
would
prefer
to
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
to
give
the
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
a
guide.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
i
would
like
the
court
to
understand
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
through
it.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
none
at
all.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right.
i
would
like
to
point
this
out.
but,
in
order
to
accomplish
irrigation
in
that
area,
it
requires
huge
investment
and
projects.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
the
bank
won't
loan
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
the
bank
won't
loan
you
money,
but
when
you're
entitled
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
it's
all
good.
if
someone
else
owns
it,
that
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
don't
think
a
cloud
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
--
would
be
an
absolute
title
vested
elsewhere.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
of
course
you
can
always
use
water
in
the
area
there
is
and
when
you
get
to
go
whenever
you
can.
that's
just
the
way
we
have
to
operate
out
there,
but
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes
and,
for
instance,
what
--
really
what
this
brought
this
lawsuit
and
what
caused
this
lawsuit
was
the
desire
of
arizona
to
build
the
central
arizona
project
in
the
central
part
of
the
state
which
is
a
water
starved
area
suffered
--
suffering
such
critical
shortages
as
to
actually
force
large
acreage
out
of
cultivation.
that,
coupled
with
the
increasing
demands
of
a
growing
population
and
increased
and
expanding
industrial
and
commercial
uses,
has
produced
a
very
acute
situation.
to
the
extent
that
this
court
commits
the
water
elsewhere,
we
can't
go
before
congress
or
anywhere
else
and
say
"here
is
the
extent
of
our
water
rights.
we
can
use
this
number
of
acre-feet
and
that
would
justify
or
make
economically
feasible
and
desirable
funds
for
the
rebuilding
of
the
project
to
such-and-such
a
size.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
i
--
it
would
of
course
be
forced
with
--
the
federal
government
would
be
forced
with
lawsuits
in
the
indian
court
of
claims.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
no,
your
honor.
he
--
the
entitlements
for
the
government
are
charged
against
the
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
--
(voice
overlap)
--
each
state
where
the
use
takes
place.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
none
of
the
parties
has,
except
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
i
think,
originally,
the
united
states
argued
for
and
still
thinks
it
should
have,
i
believe,
a
separate
allocation
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
--
to
it,
quite
apart
from
the
allocation
to
the
states.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
and
every
acre-foot
of
water
that's
reserved
for
an
indian
reservation
which
they
surely
won't
use
for
a
long
time,
and
maybe
never,
it's
just
that
it's
an
acre-foot
less
for
the
center
of
arizona
project
or
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
and
other
federal
statutes,
surely,
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
correct.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
quite
right.
he
had
planned
to
do
without
the
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
what
i
expect
to
argue
when
we
get
to
it.
now,
the
--
one
other
indian
reservation
within
arizona
is
the
cocopah.
that
is
a
small
reservation
of
some-500
acres.
the
population
in
the
tribal
roads
is
only
90.
the
number
of
indians
living
on
that
reservation
was
not
established.
the
master
made
no
finding.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
no,
this
reservation
was
established
september
27,
1917
and
after
statehood.
the
two
i
have
just
mentioned
were
both
established
and
enlarged
before
statehood.
to
make
the
picture
complete,
there
is
the
chemehuevi
indian
reservation
located
entirely
within
california,
but
the
population
shown
on
the
tribal
roads
of
300
and
with
no
indians
residing
on
the
reservation.
and,
the
remaining
indian
reservation
mainstream
is
the
yuma
reservation
likewise
located
entirely
within
california,
surf
through
the
facilities
of
the
all-american
canal.
the
tribal
population
or
population
on
the
tribal
roads
is
some-1,200
indians
with
approximately
900
residing
on
that
reservation.
in
addition
to
the
indian
reservations,
there
is
the
lake
mead
recreational
area.
will
you
outline
generally
the
area
there?
as
you
can
see,
that's
an
area
surrounding
lake
mead
and,
in
that
vicinity,
i'm
going
beyond
that.
there
are
some-1,899,000
acres-plus
in
that
reservation,
of
which
1,209,000
are
in
arizona,
the
balance
being
in
nevada.
that
was
established
by
executive
order
may
3,
1929,
enlarged
by
executive
order
april
25,
1930.
the
master,
with
respect
to
that
reservation,
concluded
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
on
which
to
base
a
finding
as
to
the
ultimate
needs
but
held
--
found
they
had
the
right
to
use
mainstream
water
in
quantities
reasonably
necessary
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
area.
and
there
is
havasu
lake
national
wildlife
refuge,
being
approximately
some-40,000
acres
in
arizona
and
california.
no
breakdown
was
made
with
respect
to
how
much
was
within
each
state.
that
was
established
january
22,
1941
by
executive
order
and
enlarged
by
executive
order
in
1949.
the
master
recommended
a
diversion
right
of
41,839
acre-feet
per
year
and,
here,
he
used
the
consumptive
use
because
the
evidence
permitted
it
or
a
consumptive
use
of
37,339
acre-feet
per
anum,
whichever
is
less.
that,
likewise,
was
not
segregated
as
to
what
state
that
should
be
charged
against.
that
poses
a
small
problem.
in
addition,
there's
the
imperial
national
wildlife
refuge.
that
was
established
by
executive
order
february
14,
1941.
the
total
area
located
in
arizona
and
california
is
50
--
some-51,000
acres.
the
master
recommended
an
annual
diversion
right
of
28,000
acre-feet
per
year
or
a
consumptive
use
of
23,000
acre-feet
per
year,
or
whichever
is
less,
and
that
was
not
segregated
or
divided
up
as
between
states
or
as
to
which
state
would
--
the
allotment
would
be
subtracted
on
amount.
now,
roughly,
that
covers
the
background
as
to
the
federal
establishment
on
the
mainstream.
with
respect
to
the
tributary
claims,
the
master,
as
i
indicated,
refused
to
make
an
adjudication
with
respect
to
any
claims
of
the
government
or
any
other
parties
on
any
of
the
tributaries
except
the
gila
river.
i
will
discuss
the
tributary
water
aspect
to
the
government's
claims
later.
now,
one
thing
i
think
i
should
make
quite
clear
before
i
proceed
further
is
that
arizona's
quarrel
with
the
--
these
findings
and
these
conclusions
of
law
of
the
master
do
not
amount,
as
the
government
assumes
in
its
brief,
to
a
contest,
on
the
one
hand,
between
the
indians
in
arizona
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
non-indians
in
arizona.
to
make
that
quite
clear,
all
i
mean
to
do
is
to
point
out
to
your
honors
that,
as
we
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
the
central
arizona
project
is
the
motivating
cause
of
this
litigation.
now,
within
that
project,
there
are
more
indians
than
the
total
number
involved
on
these
mainstream
reservations,
indians
who
are
in
desperate
need
of
water,
as
is
much
of
the
balance
of
that
area.
on
the
gila
river
indian
reservation,
which
is
for
the
pima-maricopa
tribes,
the
master
found
that
there
resides
on
the
reservation
5,700
indians.
that
reservation
is
a
part
of
what
is
known
as
the
san
carlos
federal
irrigation
project.
it
--
within
that
project,
there
are
50,000
acres
of
indian-owned
lands
and
50,000
acres
of
non-india-owned
lands.
it's
a
sort
of
a
partnership.
it
was
built
as
a
result
of
the
act
passed
in
1924
by
congress
providing
for
the
construction
of
coolie's
dam.
the
government
fixed
its
estimate
of
the
needs
of
the
indians
when
it
found
that
that
needs
could
be
served
by
subjugating
and
irrigating
some-50,000
acres
of
land.
it,
likewise,
was
discovered
that
it
was
not
economically
feasible
to
build
that
inexpensive
project
for
only
50,000
acres.
so,
an
additional
50,000
acres
of
white-owned
lands
were
included
and
it
formed
sort
of
a
--
it
is
sort
of
a
partnership
between
the
indians
and
non-indians
and,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
represents
one
of
the
best
examples
of
how
the
indians
can
join
in
the
way
of
life
of
the
non-indians
and
improve
their
life.
however,
at
the
moment,
their
lot
is,
i
must
confess,
is
fairly
pitiful.
that
area
is
almost
invariably
pointed
to
as
the
horrible
example
of
what
happens
when
you
build
a
project
and
establish
an
economy,
depend
it
on
water
from
it,
and
the
water
either
doesn't
materialize
or,
for
some
reason
or
another,
is
substantially
decreased.
the
facts
are
that,
of
that
50,000
acres
on
the
indian
reservation,
on
the
average
for
the
years
1939
through
1955,
the
last
year
of
record,
the
indians
were
able
to
farm
only
half
of
it,
less
than
half,
24,584
due
entirely
to
water
shortage.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
that
is
a
portion
of
the
central
arizona
plan,
that
area.
and
on
--
it
--
i
would
say,
in
my
way
of
thinking,
i
might
be
a
little
prejudice
with
respect
to
that
area
since
that's
where
i
live
but
it's
conceded
that
the
need
for
water
there
is
more
acute
than
any
other
area
in
central
arizona,
perhaps
with
the
exception
of
one
other
area.
there
is
sort
of
a
contest
dividing
as
to
who
is
in
the
worst
shape.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
it's
a
comparable
figure.
i
didn't
bring
those
since
we
were
dealing
only
with
--
i
use
this
only
to
point
out
that
for
every
acre-foot
that's
reserved
and
set
aside
for
the
mainstream
indian
reservations,
just
by
that
much
is
the
chance
of
the
indians,
as
well
as
the
non-indians,
in
central
arizona
to
meet
their
need.
the
situation
is
this.
we
know
very
well
that
the
amount
of
water
that's
available
or
will
be
available
certainly
won't
be
added,
but
to
rescue
all
the
areas
in
arizona
that
need
supplemental
water
supply
is
going
to
be
a
process
of
choosing
and
selecting.
it
has
to
be
that.
you
have
the
situation
where
the
amount
of
acreage
which
has
the
need
for
water
is
larger
than
the
water
supply
can
be
in
any
event.
so,
no
one
can
say
at
this
time
precisely
who's
going
to
get
water.
i
suspect
there'll
be
trouble
about
that
later
on
but,
certainly,
those
indians
in
that
reservation
is
within
the
central
arizona
project
plan.
as
i
say,
it's
used
as
--
the
indians
and
their
non-indian
partners
are
used
as
the
horrible
example
of
the
effects
of
an
insufficient
water
supply.
in
addition,
there
is
the
salt
river
indian
reservation,
which
is
10
miles
east
of
phoenix,
having
a
total
area
of
only
47,000
acres,
presently
irrigated
on
that
area
some-12,000
acres,
and
there
reside
on
that
reservation
members
of
the
pima-maricopa
tribe
aggregating
approximately
1,500
indians.
then,
again,
there
is
the
fort
mcdowell
indian
reservation
which
abuts
on
the
northeast
corner
of
the
salt
river
indian
reservation.
that's
inhabited
by
300
members
of
the
fort
mcdowell
mohave-apache
tribe.
the
irrigable
lake
which
is
of
that
reservation
is
some-1,300
acres.
its
total
area
is
25,000.
in
addition,
there
are
other
reservations
in
arizona.
the
one
i
particularly
call
to
mind
is
the
fort
apache
indian
reservation,
while
not
within
the
central
arizona
project
area,
the
plan
is
at
least
are
that
by
process
of
exchange
of
water,
you
see,
they
occupy
the
area
in
the
white
mountains
where
they
use
water
from
white
river
which
is
--
in
turn
goes
--
it
flows
into
the
salt
which
in
turn
is
the
water
supply
for
the
area
around
phoenix.
there
is
litigation
pending
at
present
between
the
salt
river
valley
water
use
association
and
the
tribe
or
its
representatives
over
activities
of
the
tribe
in
building
dams
for
small
lakes
for
recreational
purposes.
it
would
certainly
ease
that
situation.
however,
i
make
no
representation
as
to
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i'm
coming
to
that.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
your
honor
it's
quite
right
and
i
regret
the
use
of
time.
i
have
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
--
questions
of
the
court
to
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i'll
proceed
to
that
immediately.
i
thought,
however,
mr.
justice
black,
that
i
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
thought
i
did
indicate
or
state
precisely
the
amounts
which
the
master
had
set
aside.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i'll
be
happy
to
enumerate
what
we
think
are
vital
factors
which
were
not
even
considered
or
taken
then
to
account
in
arriving
at
the
recommended
allocation.
for
instance,
regarded
as
not
significant,
it's
playing
no
part
on
the
resolution
of
this
issue
was
a
fact
of
whether
the
waters
were
navigable
or
non-navigable,
whether
the
reservations
were
created
before
or
after
statehood,
whether
they
were
treated
--
created
by
a
treaty,
a
statute,
or
executive
orders.
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
neither
was
there,
as
a
basis
or
taken
into
account,
the
number
of
indians
living
on
the
reservation
or
the
trends
of
indians
as
to
either
living
or
not
living
or
moving
away
from
the
reservations.
no
consideration
was
given
to
water
uses
by
the
indians,
either
past
or
present,
as
forming
any
basis
for
the
conclusion
reached
in
the
recommended
decree,
nor
as
to
the
trend
of
the
indians
as
being
farmers
or
following
that
occupation.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
and
maybe
i
can
make
it
clear
if
i
explain
exactly
what
the
master
did
and
his
reasoning
for
doing
so.
although
i
thought
i
did
explain
that,
maybe
i
didn't
make
myself
sufficiently
clear.
the
master
approached
the
problem
this
way,
that
those
reservations
were
set
aside
by
the
government
in
the
performance
of
the
duty
it
owed
to
its
indian
lords
and
with
the
intent
and
expectation
that
they
would
farm
those
lands
and
establish
a
farming
economy
on
them.
the
criteria
which
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
--
he
used
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
the
master's
position,
if
the
court
please,
i
might
explain
that,
is
that
it
makes
no
difference,
that
forever
that
right
is
attached
to
those
lands
and,
even
if
disposed
of
to
non-indians,
it
will
still
carry
with
it
the
right.
it's
a
right
in
perpetuity
whether
ever
used
or
not
and
regards
as
to
the
amount
of
use.
he
classifies
it,
those
--
as
to
--
with
respect
to
those
reservations
that
were
withdrawn
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
project
act
in
1929,
as
being
a
special
category
of
present
perfected
rights,
as
his
report
clearly
states.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
irrigable
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right,
the
sole
test
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right.
i
plan
to
go
into
all
of
this
if
i
have
enough
time.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
authorization
by
congress
was
even
considered.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
we
certainly
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
--
contend
so.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
we
certainly
contend
so.
i
don't
believe
the
government
agrees
with
that.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
no,
if
the
court
--
if
your
honor
please,
our
position
is
this.
that
the
executive,
in
the
absence
of
enabling
legislation
by
congress
and
that
the
--
from
which
that
power
must
come
under
the
property
clause
of
the
constitution.
only
if
that
enabling
legislation
is
enacted
in
the
executive
department
act,
now,
it
may
be,
as
was
held
in
the
midland
or
midwest
oil
land
case,
that
certain
acquiescence
on
the
part
of
congress
may
be
inferred
from
the
peculiar
circumstances
or
that
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
right.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
thoroughly
agree
and
i
think
it
has
particular
application
to
navigable
waters
which
are
held
in
trust
by
the
national
government.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
the
lands
that's
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
either
directly
or
by
implication,
that's
correct.
now,
we
regard
all
of
those
matters,
as
well
as
the
further
matter
that
no
--
the
master
felt
that
the
--
he
need
not
examine
into
the
source
of
the
authority
of
the
united
states
to
reserve
water.
he
considered
that
matter
established
by
the
winters
case
and
his
report
so
states
explicitly
that
we
need
not
--
he
need
not,
at
least,
and
did
not,
i
presume,
inquire
with
respect
to
the
source
of
that
authority.
now,
we
regard
all
of
these
matters
as
of
vital
importance
and
i'm
going
to
have
to
just
hit
the
high
places
i
can
see
with
respect
to
our
contention.
in
the
first
place,
the
water
involved
on
the
mainstream
is
navigable
water.
now,
soon
after
the
formation
of
this
nation,
this
court
adjudicated
with
respect
to
the
rights,
on
the
one
hand,
of
the
national
government
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
states
regarding
navigable
water.
imported,
as
a
part
of
the
common
law
from
england,
was
the
concept
that
navigable
waters
are
public
waters,
that
they
affect
and
concern
the
people
as
a
whole
in
such
vital
respects
as
to
demand
or
require
that
they'd
be
classified
as
public
water,
held,
if
held
at
all,
by
the
sovereign
and
by
the
king
in
trust
for
the
--
for
the
people.
on
the
other
hand,
non-navigable
waters
in
england
were
regarded
as
not
being
public
waters
and
not
being
of
that
significance
to
the
people
at
large
or
as
a
whole,
and
they're
classified
as
private
water
in
which
private
rights
might
be
obtained.
that
distinction
has
been
carried
forward
to
this
day.
i
think
we
should
keep
in
mind
always
that
the
basic
classification
is
public
water
and
private
water,
not
navigable
and
non-navigable.
it
so
happens
that,
in
england,
navigable
waters
fell
under
the
category
or
classification
of
public
water
and
non-navigable
under
the
classification
of
private
waters,
but
the
basic
fundamental
distinction
is
whether
or
not
the
water
is
of
such
importance
to
the
people
as
a
whole
as
to
justify
its
classification
as
public
water.
now,
it
was
early
recognized
that
while
--
during
territorial
status,
while
the
united
states
held
those
lands
as
local,
as
well
as
national
sovereign,
that
it
held
only
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
future
states
and
the
people
of
that
state.
that,
upon
the
admission
to
statehood
or
the
creation
of
a
state,
automatically,
that
trust
property
went
to
the
state
and
the
state
obtained
full
sovereignty
and
control
over.
the
theory,
of
course,
being
that,
under
our
peculiar
form
of
government,
actually
the
people
are
sovereign
and,
except
as
they
have
delegated
sovereign
attributes
to
the
national
government,
they
remain
in
the
people
or
the
states
for
them.
and,
the
courts
held
that
this
was
one
respect
in
which
sovereignty
or
sovereign
prerogatives
were
not
vested
by
the
constitution
and
the
national
government,
so
they
remain
and
reposed
in
the
states.
now,
that
rule
has
been
followed
without
exception
by
this
court.
it's
the
law
today
just
as
it
was
then.
it's
predicated
in
part
on
the
requirement
of
a
quality
between
states
that
the
new
states
be
permitted
the
same
sovereign
prerogative
as
ours
in
control
as
the
older
states.
obviously,
a
disposing
of
the
navigable
waters
within
a
state
prior
to
statehood
means
a
contraction
or
lessening
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
with
respect
to
those
waters.now,
that
has
an
important
bearing,
as
we
see
it,
upon
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
as
to
the
federal
establishments
created
after
statehood,
the
national
government
simply
have
no
power,
and
had
no
ownership,
no
authority,
or
no
sovereignty
by
which
it
could
dispose
of
those
navigable
waters
for
the
benefit
of
its
own
establishments.
that
power
had
ceased
and
it
held
it
only
as
local
sovereign
while
the
territorial
status
remained.
but,
upon
the
attainment
of
statehood,
the
only
prerogative
that
the
national
government
retained
in
navigable
waters
is
under
the
commerce
clause.
that
power
of
course
is
in
terms,
as
this
court
has
said,
is
in
terms
of
power
and
not
of
property
and
the
limitations
on
that
power,
although
the
power
is
quite
broad
and
extensive
and
much
has
been
done
by
the
national
government
pursuant
to
that
power,
obviously,
there
is
a
real
distinction
between
the
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
with
respect
to
navigable
waters
and,
on
the
other
hand,
an
ownership
or
complete
sovereignty
over
those
waters
in
the
states.
the
fact
that
the
waters
are
navigable
also
have,
we
think,
this
very
vital
bearing
on
the
case
and
that
is
with
respect
to
the
manifestation
of
an
intent
due
to
--
let
me
explain
that.
due
to
the
trust
character
in
which
these
navigable
waters
are
held
by
the
national
government
and
due
to
the
fact
that
their
disposal
means
a
denial
to
some
extent
of
sovereignty
to
the
later
state,
the
cases
recognized
that
there
is
a
presumption
against
disposal
during
territorial
days
by
the
federal
government.
that
to
overcome
that
presumption,
they
--
there
must
be
either
an
expressed
statement
of
intent
to
do
so
or
that
intent
must
be
made
very
clear
from
the
evidence.
it
need
not
be
stated
in
so
many
words
but
there
must
be
no
doubt
of
what
the
government
intended
to
dispose
of
that
navigable
water
during
the
territorial
days.
now,
the
master,
in
disposing
of
this
phase
of
the
case,
and
let
me
say
now
that
i
--
what
i
have
been
saying
is
not
in
criticism
of
the
master.
actually,
we
didn't
give
him
much
help,
none
of
us
did,
on
this.
i
--
as
he
charitably
remarked
in
the
report,
the
attention
and
energies
of
the
parties
were
devoted
to
other
aspects
of
this
case,
and
i
plead
guilty
for
arizona
in
that
respect.
i
think
it's
true
of
all
the
parties.
we
simply
were
occupied
with
other
matters
and
we
did
not
make
the
presentation
that
we
should've
made
with
respect
to
these
serious
and
intricate
legal
questions.
now,
the
master
found
that
all
that
was
necessary
was
an
implied
intent
and
he
relied
upon
circumstances
as
supplying
that
implied
intent.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
but
that
was
non-navigable
waters,
your
honor.
now,
i
make
this
distinction
and
the
cases
recognize
it.
as
to
non-navigable
waters,
there's
no
presumption
against
disposal.
it's
not
held
in
trust,
nor
does
it
impair
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
that
disposed
of
it.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
i
think
we
have
this
difference.
we
--
we
can't
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
no.
both
agree
there
must
be
intent.
we
deny
that
can
exist
by
implication.
we
--
it
is
our
position
that
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
circumstances
may
be
such
as
to
make
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
a
clear
manifestation
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
--
which
is
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
right.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i'm
not
sure
i
follow,
your
honor.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
you
mean
the
very
circumstances
--
the
fact
that
it
was
expected
the
indians
would
live
there
and
they
have
to
have
water
to
exist.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes
--
yes,
and
i
think
that
was
the
basis
of
the
master's
holding.
in
that
respect,
i
think
the
master
felt
that
the
only
way
that
the
purpose
of
the
government,
which
admittedly
was
that
the
indians
would
use
water,
could
be
accomplished
was
by
reserving
the
water.
now,
that's
where
we
differ
with
the
master,
and
i
want
to
briefly
refer
to
the
circumstances
which
we
think
establish
beyond
all
question
that
congress
itself
did
not
intend
to
reserve
the
water.
in
the
first
place,
this
is
back
in
1865
when
there
was
an
abundance
of
water.
literally,
millions
of
acre-feet
per
year
flowed
by
that
reservation
unused
and
wasted
into
the
gulf.
the
water
was
there
for
the
taking.
all
you
had
to
do
was
dig
a
ditch,
get
some
other
diversion
structure,
and
put
it
to
the
land.
now,
under
the
arizona
law
that
existed
at
that
time,
that's
likewise
all
you
had
to
do
to
get
an
appropriative
right.
you
only
had
to
use
it.
you
didn't
even
have
to
post
a
notice.
the
statute
respecting
notice
that
was
not
passed
by
the
arizona
territorial
legislature
until
1893
and
the
court
held
that,
even
then,
its
only
application
was
with
relation
to
the
doctrine
of
relation
back.
if
you
didn't
file
a
notice,
you
could
not
as
you
could
previously
relate
here
right
back
to
the
time
when
you
first
formed
the
intent
and
start
to
work
to
perfect
the
appropriation.
so,
to
say
that
the
government
thought
that
the
indians
--
“intend
the
indians
should
use
this
water,
therefore,
it
thought
it
must
reserve
them”
does
not
follow
because
the
mere
use
of
it,
which
the
government
intended,
would
establish
an
appropriative
right
so
that
it
was
not
at
all
necessary
or
essential
to
accomplish
the
end
that
congress
had
in
mind
that
it
reserve,
set
aside,
place
in
a
safety
deposit
box,
or
some
other
fashion
earmark
a
given
quantity
of
water
to
make
sure
that
the
indians
got
it.
there
was
no
competition
over
water
rights
in
those
days
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
for
the
future,
your
honor
means.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
your
honor,
but
by
the
mere
use
it,
they
acquired
a
vested
valid
right
prior
to
any
subsequent
uses.
so,
you
had
the
same
protection.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
that's
true,
but
that's
--
our
hindsight
of
course
is
much
better
than
the
foresight
of
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
--
those
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes,
i
think,
undoubtedly,
it
was
the
intent
of
congress.
but,
i
wouldn't
like
to
really
examine
this
question
now.
it's
assumed
that
it
was
the
obligation
and
duty
of
the
government
to
set
aside
an
amount
of
water
that
would
meet
the
ultimate
needs
of
those
indians
in
the
indefinite
future.
now,
i
question
that
and
i
seriously
question
it.
i
don't
believe
that
it
was
the
thinking
at
that
time
or
that
is
the
thinking
now
that
we'll
take
indians
and
set
them
aside
on
a
reservation
that
they'll
stay
there
for
the
rest
of
their
lives,
farm
little
indian
ghettos,
if
you
please,
that
they
will
not
join
the
non-indians
in
their
way
of
life
for
--
at
anytime
forever.
i
think
and
i
have
viewed
the
intention
of
the
government
in
this
way.
that
was
a
first
step
to
take
care
of
an
underprivileged,
untrained,
untutored
group
of
human
beings.
i
don't
think
it
was
regarded
nor
is
it
regarded
by
congress
now
as
the
final
step
to
help
and
to
see
to
it
that
the
indians
get
the
same
privileges
as
the
other
members
of
the
human
race
are
entitled
to.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
think
if
the
court
would
--
your
honor
would
read
the
report
made
by
mr.
poston
when
he
recommended
the
establishment
of
this
reservation,
you'll
see
he
had
a
rather
broad
outlook
on
the
proper
way
in
which
the
indian
problem
would
be
met
with
in
the
future.
it
all
depends
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
it
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
i
don't
know
what
your
honor
means
by
current.
it's
so
happens
that
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well
i
--
i
would
say
this,
your
honor.
that,
30
years
ago,
that's
my
first
combat
with
this
problem.
there
was
a
difference
in
the
view
point
but,
at
that
time,
there
was
a
large
segment.
the
people
who
concerned
themselves
with
such
things
who
felt
very
firmly
that
the
worst
thing
you
could
do
for
the
indians
was
what
we
were
doing,
that
you
destroy
their
initiative,
you
prevent
them
from
reaching
a
status
of
equality
with
the
non-indians
by
the
very
fact
that
you
place
them
on
a
reservation,
you
exercise
control
over
them
as
their
guardian,
they
get
dependent
upon
the
efforts
of
the
government
and
the
funds
supplied
by
the
government.
and,
as
a
consequence,
they
lose
the
incentive.
i
also
have
heard
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
which
i
will
not
repeat
unless
your
honor
would
like
to
hear
it.
but,
i
do
think
this,
that
the
real
answer
to
that
is
turn
to
the
things
that
congress
did
and
then
we
will
see
its
intent,
and
i
want
to
stress
that
aspect
of
it.
the
best
evidence
i
know
of
what
congress
intended
is
what
congress
itself
said
and,
of
course,
it
is
a
rule
that
subsequent
acts
and
actions
by
congress
may
be
used
to
interpret
and
construe
legislation
passed
by
congress.
now,
to
go
over
this
quickly,
and
i
wonder
if
the
clerk
can
tell
me
how
much
time
i
have
remaining,
17?
i
want
to
direct
your
honor's
attention
first
to
the
act
of
april
21,
1904
whereby
the
secretary
was
expressly
authorized
to
include
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation
and
the
yuma
indian
reservation
in
a
reclamation
project.
and,
if
that
were
done,
the
secretary
is
hereby
authorized
to
divert
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
and
to
reclaim,
utilize,
and
dispose
of
any
lands
in
the
said
reservation.
it
also
goes
ahead
to
provide
there
that
there
shall
be
reserved
for
and
allotted
to
each
of
the
indians
belonging
on
the
said
reservation
5
acres
of
irrigable
lands.
the
remainder
of
the
irrigable
lands,
the
lands
irrigable
in
the
said
reservation,
shall
be
disposed
of
to
settlers
on
the
provisions
of
the
reclamation
act.
now,
that
is
followed
by
a
long
series
of
acts,
which
i
want
to
briefly
discuss,
but
the
notion
that
these
lands
should
be
included
and
authority
given
to
include
them
within
a
reclamation
project
which,
by
its
terms,
provides
that
state
law
shall
govern,
that
beneficial
use
shall
be
the
basis,
the
extent,
and
the
measure
of
the
right
to
use
water
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
any
thought
that
there
had
been
reserved
water
for
those
reservation
lands.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
was
reading
from
the
act
of
april
21,
1904,
33,
step
224.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
colorado.
also,
in
1911,
that
act
was
amended
to
increase
the
allotment
from
5
acres
to
10
acres
per
indian.
the
same
provision
was
retained
and
it
was
--
retained
the
provision
that
the
entire
cost
of
the
irrigation
of
lotted
lands
shall
be
reimbursed
to
the
united
states
from
any
fund
received
from
the
sale
of
surplus
lands
of
the
reservation
or
from
other
funds
that
may
become
available.
now,
this
court
construed
that
act
in
united
states
versus
arizona
at
295
us
174,
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
speaking
of
that
act,
the
court
said
it
was
merely
to
empower
the
secretary
if
the
circumstances
stated,
that
is
inclusion
of
the
reservation
within
the
reclamation
project,
if
the
circumstances
stated
should
arrive
to
reclaim
lands
in
these
reservations
by
use
of
water
to
be
taken
from
that
river,
the
authority
granted
was
no
more
than
permission
to
appropriate
them,
that
is
the
water,
for
the
purpose
specified.
now,
you
certainly
didn't
need
any
consent
to
divert
water
or
to
appropriate
water
if
the
government
had
already,
back
in
1865,
reserved
that
water
in
perpetuity
for
those
indians.
but,
more
significant
is
later
legislation
of
congress.
by
the
act
of
april
4,
1910,
congress
appropriated
$50,000
for
the
use
on
the
colorado
reservation
to
build
canals
and
laterals
and
a
pumping
plant
and,
mind
you
this
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this,
for
the
purpose
of
securing
and
appropriation
of
water
for
the
irrigation
of
approximately
150,000
acres
to
be
reimbursed
in
the
sale
of
surplus
lands.
now,
there
simply
could
--
you
can't
reconcile
these
two
things,
one,
that
congress
had
intended
to
and
had,
either
directly
or
by
authority
conferred
on
the
executive,
set
aside
all
the
water
that
would
ever
needed
by
it
--
be
needed
by
those
indians
for
all
the
time
to
come
with
the
notion,
on
the
other
hand,
that
they
needed
to
acquire
rights
for
that
reservation
by
appropriation,
yet
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
the
reserved
right,
as
it
has
been
determined
here,
is
whatever
amount
of
water
the
indians
may
need.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
what
occasion
is
there
for
additional
water?
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
i
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
would
like
(voice
overlap)
to
examine
that
closely
because
i
think
it's
very
vital
to
our
position
here.
the
fact
they
weren't
getting
the
water
wasn't
due
to
any
shortcoming
in
the
reservation
of
water
concept.
it
was
due
to
the
difficulties
of
building
canals.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
yes.
now,
all
congress
need
to
have
done
was
appropriate
$50,000
to
use
the
water
it
had
reserved,
if
it
had
reserved
it.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
it
certainly
did
not
need
to
go
ahead
and
say
“for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
rights
under
the
appropriation
doctrine."
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well,
i
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
if
i
may
say
so,
i
think
your
honor
is
confusing
the
efforts
in
the
furnishing
of
bonds
with
the
point
that
a
water
act,
if
already
existing,
sufficient
to
supply
their
ultimate
needs
would
make
feudal
and
needless
the
appropriation
of
any
water.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
it
makes
no
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
under
the
reservation
concept,
they
have
the
right
if
they
never
used
the
water.
it's
always
there.
so,
you
don't
need
to
appropriate
it
to
get
it.
your
right
is
established
by
the
very
reservation
itself.
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
well
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
i
can't
--
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
chas.
h.
reed
i'm
sorry
i
can't
make
that
clear
to
your
honor.
i
feel
very
strongly
that
the
two
are
completely
incompatible,
that
they're
mutually
incom
--
that
you
cannot
reconcile
the
two
approaches.
now,
as
bearing
on
the
--
that
legislation,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
wrote
a
letter
recommending
the
enactment
of
that
legislation
to
the
chairman
of
the
indian
affairs.
in
that
letter,
he
makes
the
significant
statement
that,
"findings
are
being
made
by
citizens
and
corporations
upon
the
water
to
this
river
and,
if
rights
are
to
be
initiated,”
rights
are
to
be
initiated,
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
any.
"for
these
indian
lands,
the
work
should
be
started
at
an
early
date
with
a
view
to
making
a
proper
appropriation."
and
he
goes
and
have
to
add,
"in
this
manner,
a
just
claim
upon
sufficient
water
to
irrigate
150,000
acres
on
the
indian
reservation
can
be
established."
now,
if
they
already
have
a
reserved
right
to
whatever
amount
they
need,
there's
no
occasion
to
initiate
rights,
there's
no
occasion
to
establish
rights.
they
have
the
best
water
right
to
--
in
the
whole
country.
you
can't,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
reconcile
those
two
things.
that
initial
act
of
april
4,
1910
was
followed
by
identical
acts
for
the
next
nine
years
with
the
exact
language
for
the
purpose
of
securing
appropriation
for
water.
so,
for
10
successive
years,
congress
appropriated
funds
to
enable
the
indians
in
the
colorado
river
reservation
to
secure
a
right
in
water
by
appropriation
or
pursuant
to
the
appropriations
doctrine.
as
we
view
it,
that
was
another
action
that
indicated
that
congress
thought,
particularly
since
it
was
navigable
water,
that
the
local
laws
and
custom
should
be
controlling
and
governing
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
of
that
right
and
that,
also,
it
did
not
intend
to
impair
the
sovereignty
of
the
future
state
by
reserving
or
disposing
of
that
navigable
water
in
a
special
fashion
or
a
special
or
a
preferred
use.
it's
completely
consistent
with
the
many
factors
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
united
states
holds
navigable
water
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
future
states,
but
that
isn't
all
with
respect
to
the
acts
of
congress.
congress
went
on,
following
the
act
of
1919,
and
continued
to
appropriate
water
--
money
in
connection
with
the
building
of
irrigation
facilities
and
referred
back
to
the
original
act
of
1910
for
the
purpose
of
that
act.
that
continued,
as
i
recall,
up
to
the
year
1935
or
1936.
following
that,
there
was
a
series
of
legislation
on
the
part
of
congress
appropriating
funds
for
the
purchase
of
water
rights
and
to
ensure
or
protect
against
loss
of
water
rights.
now,
neither
of
those
concepts
can
be
reconciled
with
the
reservation
period.
you
don't
buy
water
rights
if
you
already
have
a
reserved
right
and
you
can't
lose
your
water
rights
if
you
have
a
reserved
right.
it's
there
for
all
time
to
come
regardless
of
the
extent
of
the
use.
now,
i
see
that
my
time
is
rapidly
being
exhausted.
i
haven't,
by
any
means,
covered
all
the
things
that
i
intended
to
cover.
i'm
going
to
briefly
proceed,
in
a
hit
in
cover
and
--
or
to
hit-and-run
fashion,
some
of
the
more
significant
points
that,
unfortunately,
i
won't
be
able
to
elaborate
on.
we
take
a
special
exception
to
the
irrigable
acreage
test
as
the
criteria
or
the
measurement
of
the
indian
life.
i
think
in
order
to
get
in
proper
perspective
to
examine
that
criteria,
one
has
to
appreciate
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
water.
unlike
most
things,
if
you
don't
use
it,
it's
gone
forever.
it
flows
on
by
and
the
use
of
it
is
forever
gone.
in
the
arid
west,
conditions
simply
demand
that
there'd
be
a
maximum
utilization
of
that
water
supply
because
it
forms
the
ceiling
of
growth
and
development.
so
that
any
approach
to
water
which
would
result
in
a
carving
out,
earmarking,
or
setting
aside
of
a
segment
of
the
total
supply
which
may
not
ever
be
used
and
certainly
will
not
presently
and
for
sometime
to
come
be
used
is
just
simply
an
improvident
way
to
deal
with
a
product
or
a
commodity
or
a
substance
to
attend
short
supply.
the
whole
effort
in
the
arid
area
is
to
arrive
at
some
sort
of
system
or
solution
which
will
permit
the
broadest
and
widest
utilization
of
that
scarce
resource
rather
than
creating
special
rights
and
prerogatives
in
it
which
will
not
be
used.
you
just
--
we
just
don't
do
that
with
regard
to
water
where
it's
so
terribly
valuable
in
such
short
supply.
now,
there's
one
other
thing
that
i
think
i
should
bring
out
to
this
court
here,
a
number
that
i
would
like
to
but
i
think
i
should
clarify
the
position
which
we
take
in
our
brief
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment.
i
don't
believe
that
we
clearly
stated
the
limiting
factors
or
the
limited
circumstances
under
which
that
doctrine
may
apply.
certainly,
if
this
court
follows
the
reservation
concept,
if
it
likewise
follows
the
recommendation
of
the
master
with
regard
to
present
perfected
rights,
construes
section
6
of
the
project
act
as
he's
construed
it,
then
the
project
act,
in
effect,
has
made
an
allocation
to
the
indians
in
that
way.
it
recog
--
it's
not
the
source
of
the
right
anymore
than
it
would
be
the
source
of
other
present
perfected
rights,
but
it
recognizes
and
preserves
them
and,
to
that
extent,
makes
a
disposition
of
water.
now,
if
that's
done
and
if
the
court
considers
that
to
be
the
law,
one,
that
the
reservation
concept
is
correct,
second,
that
it's
a
present
perfected
right
and
that
present
perfected
rights
are
preserved.
and,
of
course,
there's
no
room
for
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
even
with
respect
to
indian
uses
on
the
mainstream
versus
uses
elsewhere
in
arizona
because
the
project
act,
having
dealt
with
that
matter,
congress
having
spoken,
having
made
that
distribution,
there
simply
does
not
exist
any
situation
in
which
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
should
apply.
one
other
matter
has
a
bearing
on
that
and
that
is
that
the
master
construed
the
arizona
contract
as
authorizing
the
secretary
to
contract
with
whom
he
pleased
and
for
whatever
amount
he
pleased
in
arizona
for
the
use
of
lake
mead's
water.
we
did
not
truly
appreciate
the
significance
of
that
ruling
at
the
time
as
bearing
on
the
equitable
apportionment
thing
particularly
and
the
rights
of
the
indians,
but
we
have
not
accepted
the
master's
construction
of
our
contract.
we
think
it's
right.
now,
if
that's
right,
the
secretary
is
the
one
to
contract
with
everyone
in
arizona.
indians
and
non-indians,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
you
can
only
get
a
right
by
contract.
we
can't
buy
the
notion
that
he
need
not
contract
with
himself,
therefore,
need
not
have
any
contract
with
the
indians.
as
your
honors
know,
quite
often,
there
are
so-called
memoranda
of
understanding
between
departments
or
bureaus
within
the
same
department
and
certainly,
for
the
sake
of
clarity
and
certainty,
with
respect
to
water
commitments,
a
contract
should
be
made
with
the
indians
even
though
it's
called
a
memorandum
of
understanding
so
that
we'll
all
know
exactly
what
the
secretary
has
done
in
that
respect
nor
do
we
concede
he
has
unlimited
discretion.
i'm
sorry,
i
see
my
time
is
up.however,
we
have
briefed
the
points
--
most
of
the
points
that
i
had
intend
to
cover
very
fully
and
i
am
content
that
our
position
be
presented
by
our
brief.
thank
you.
