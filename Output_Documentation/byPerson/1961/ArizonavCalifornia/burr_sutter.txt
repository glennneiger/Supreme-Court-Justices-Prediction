mr.
burr
sutter
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
this
litigation
because
it
controls
the
waters
impounded
behind
hoover
dam
and
the
associated
works
along
the
mainstream
and,
consequently,
as
your
honors
will
recall,
it
was
ruled
in
one
of
the
earlier
cases
between
arizona
and
california
that
the
united
states
was
a
necessary
party
to
the
adjudication
of
rights
in
the
stream.
in
addition,
the
master
has
held,
rightly
we
think,
that
the
system
for
allocating
or
dividing,
i
use
the
word
loosely,
this
water
stems
from
a
--
partly
from
a
federal
statue
and
partly
from
its
implementation
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
and,
we
are
in
the
case
for
that
reason,
too,
because
we
think
it
appropriate
to
express
our
view
as
to
the
acts
of
congress
and
to
explen
--
explain
and
defend
the
contracts
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
being
in
the
case
for
those
reasons,
it
seemed
appropriate
to
my
predecessor,
as
well
as
to
myself,
that
the
united
states
should
speak
for
what
we
conceive
to
be
the
general
interest
in
the
apportionment
of
this
water,
the
national
interest
in
the
best
development
of
the
whole
south
west
region.
and,
finally,
we
are
here
of
course
on
behalf
of
the
indians
to
whom
the
united
states
has
a
duty
as
trustee
and,
to
that
aspect
of
the
case,
we
make
what
perhaps
might
be
called
“proprietary
claims”
as
distinguished
from
the
general
governmental
position.
it's
helpful
i
think
if
i
begin
by
trying
to
outline
the
main
divisions
of
this
case.
i
find
it
convenient
to
think
of
it
in
three
parts.
the
first
i
would
describe
is
the
interstate
controversy
over
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river,
the
mainstream
and
some
associated
waters,
which
just
arises
between
california
and
the
other
lower
basin
states.
in
the
second
division,
i
would
put
certain
incidental
questions
which
arise
assuming
if
the
court
accepts
the
main
thesis
of
the
master's
report.
without
stopping
now
to
state
them
in
detail,
one
illustration
is
the
question
of
whether
the
mainstream
above
lake
mead
should
be
treated
as
subject
to
the
apportionment,
whether
the
secretary's
contracts
are
valid
in
that
respect
or
not,
and
there's
certain
other
incidental
questions
of
that
kind.
then,
the
third
division
is
the
one
which
has
been
discussed
this
morning
by
mr.
reed
to
what
the
claims
of
the
united
states
for
water
for
the
indian
reservation.
i'll
discuss
the
three
main
divisions
in
the
orders
i've
just
states.
the
first
division
then
is
the
interstate
controversy
over
the
apportionment
of
the
waters
impounded
by
hoover
dam
and
controlled
by
the
federal
works
along
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river.
here,
instead
of
listing
the
issues,
i
find
it
convenient
myself,
and
perhaps
the
court
will,
well,
to
think
of
this
as
a
contest
between
two
main
conceptions
of
the
way
this
water
is
to
be
divided.
one,
i
shall
state
it
as
that
of
the
united
states
for
it's
essentially
the
same
as
that
of
the
master
and
of
arizona
and,
on
the
other
hand,
california's
concern.
our
view
takes
it
as
a
premise
that
the
colorado
river
compact
apportions
seven-and-a
half
million
acre-feet
to
the
upper
basin,
subject
to
the
obligation
to
deliver
an
average
of
seven-and-a
half
million
acre-feet
every
10
years,
75
million
feet
over
a
decade,
at
lee
ferry.
so,
that
might,
under
certain
circumstances
in
terms
of
supply,
cut
into
the
seven-and-a
half
million
feet
that
the
upper
basin
may
have.
what
we'd
--
i
want
to
make
it
plain
that
there
is
nothing
that
the
court
should
do
here
as
a
matter
of
law
or
should
necessarily
decide
as
a
matter
of
implication
that
would
constitute
a
precedent
the
future,
cutting
into
the
upper
basin's
seven-and-a
half
million
acre-feet
subject
to
its
article
iii
(d)
obligation.
now,
whether
the
upper
basin
can
ever
use
seven-and-a
half
million
acre-feet
is
a
question
of
fact
which
has
been
discussed
on.
there
are
some
people
who
think
they're
inherent
physical
limitation.
i
don't
urge
them.
i'm
simply
stating
the
reason
for
the
references
to
that.
we
take
it,
that
they're
to
have
their
seven-and-a
half
million
acre-feet
subject
to
the
obligation
to
send
75
million
down
every
10
years.
within
the
lower
basin,
with
decisive
fact
in
our
judgment,
is
that
the
united
states
built
hoover
dam
and
the
incidental
work,
thereby,
making
the
colorado
river
manageable
and
greatly
increasing
the
supplies
of
usable
water.
project
act,
as
we
see
it,
is
concerned
with
the
disposition
of
those
impounded
waters,
with
the
disposition
of
the
waters
of
the
mainstream
flowing
down
from
lee
ferry
and
with
the
tributaries
flowing
into
lake
mead
above
hoover
dam.
mr.
burr
sutter
no,
i
think
i
would
state
it
the
other
way
around.
we
think
that
the
master
erred
in
invalidating
the
provisions
of
the
secretary's
contracts
which
say
that,
out
of
arizona's
share
of
the
water
covered
by
the
contract,
2.8
million
acre-feet,
there
is
to
be
deducted
anything
arizona
takes
out
above
lake
mead.
we
think
mainstream
means
mainstream
all
the
way
down
the
river
and
not
--
i'll
have
the
maps
changed
at
lunch,
and
not
depart
that
mr.
ely
said
--
quite
properly
said.
the
master
had
truncated
above
lake
mead
itself.
so,
on
that
part,
we
disagree
with
the
master.
arizona
agrees
with
the
master
and,
i
take
it,
that
california
thinks
it
was
a
silly
division,
although
the
conclusions
it
draws
are
somewhat
different
than
ours.
mr.
burr
sutter
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
--
i
didn't
do
anymore
--
mean
to
do
anymore
than
state
what
i
understood
to
be
an
accepted
meaning
of
the
compact.
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
that,
then
i
think
it
should
not
be
adjudicated
here
and
it
could
not
be
properly
adjudicated
here.
i
didn't
want
to
simply
say
seven-and-a
half
million
acre-feet
because
there
is
this
article
iii
(d)
obligation,
whatever
it
may
mean,
but
i
don't
think
its
meaning
has
to
be
adjudicated
or
should
be
really
it's
required
and
what's
really
required
to
reason
about
it
in
this
case.
certainly,
not
reason
about
it
in
a
sense
of
deciding.
one
may
wish,
as
justice
frankfurter
suggested,
to
consider
the
relationship.
he
has
to
consider
the
relationship
of
the
compact
with
the
statute,
but
i
don't
think
he
has
to
reach
any
conclusion
about
the
meaning
of
the
compact.
we
also
think,
like
the
master,
that
the
project
act
supplies
the
guidelines
for
an
apportionment
of
the
waters
impounded
behind
boulder
dam
and
that
it
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
implement
that
statutory
plan.
it
states,
you'll
recall,
that
there
should
be
no
rights
in
any
water
impounded
except
by
contract
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
it
then
states
that
present
perfected
rights
are
all
to
be
protected
and,
in
our
view,
this
established
cutoff
point,
to
use
justice
black's
expression
of
a
few
days
ago,
at
1928
and
said
rights
that
were
vested
before
1928
are
to
be
protected.
as
to
the
rest,
we're
going
to
have
a
new
start
in
accordance
with
the
scheme
envisaged
by
this
statute.
section
4
in
the
california
limitation
act
in
effect,
also
they
used
the
words
"limit,"
gave
california
4.6
million
acre
--
4.4
million
acre-feet
out
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river,
4.6
out
of
the
first
7.5
and
then
one-half
of
any
waters
in
the
colorado
river
in
addition
to
the
7.5.
nature,
itself,
pretty
well
supplied
the
rest
of
the
apportionment.
everyone
agreed,
at
that
time,
that
nevada
needed
only
300,000
acre-feet.
it
could
use
only
300,000
acre-feet,
and
even
nevada's
higher
estimate
didn't
go
much
over
400,000
acre-feet
at
the
trial.
the
suggested
compact
in
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
(a),
we
think,
gave
further
guidelines
to
the
secretary.
and
then,
rounding
this
out,
in
our
view,
the
secretary's
comp
--
the
secretary's
contracts
within
the
guidelines
laid
down
by
the
statute
did
make
a
final
interstate
apportionment
of
seven-and-a
half
million
acre-feet
4.4
to
california,
300,000
to
nevada,
and
2.8
to
arizona.
mr.
burr
sutter
no,
not
quite.
i
think
the
difference
is
this.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
project
act
left
--
gave
the
secretary
sufficient
guidelines
so
that
there
were
limitations
of
what
he
could
do
but
it
also
was
left
to
him
to
move
around
a
bit
within
the
guidelines
and
to
fill
in
the
structure
and
flush
out
the
bond
by
his
contract,
which
we
think
he
did
by
the
contracts
in
evidence
that
i'll
refer
to
later
in
detail.
mr.
burr
sutter
he
could
go
a
little
under
or
a
little
above
--
mr.
burr
sutter
at
least
so
far
as
arizona
and
nevada
were
concerned.
mr.
burr
sutter
i
think
he
was
bound
--
he's
clearly
bound
by
the
california
limitation
act,
and
i
would
emphasize
that
nature
did
a
good
deal
of
the
rest
of
it
for
him.
