mr.
attorney
general
may
it
please
the
court.
priority
matter,
i
am
reminded,
however,
that
two
or
three
points
perhaps
i
better
dispose
off
before
i
go
on.
the
first,
i
have
used
throughout
this
discussion
two
terms
that
i
have
should
have
define
at
the
beginning.
i'm
not
sure
a
definition
is
needed
the
course
of
acre-foot
as
the
name
implies
as
a
cognitive
order
covering
one
acre
or
one
foot
deep.
the
other
expression
that
i
used
and
we're
all
used
is
beneficial
consumptive
use.
that's
a
term
found
on
the
colorado
river
compact.
it
is
repeated
as
consumptive
use
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
the
master
defines
it
correctly,
we
feel
as
the
quantity
diverted,
less
of
quantity
that
returns
to
the
stream.
mr.
attorney
general
pardon
me.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
now
agreed
among
all
parties.
initially,
it
was
an
issue
of
great
importance
and
how
beneficial
consumptive
use
should
be
measured.
mr.
attorney
general
it
was
--
of
importance
because
at
that
time,
arizona
was
ascertain
alleged
interpleading
that
the
question
of
what
arizona
was
charged
with
under
the
compact
and
under
the
3,100,000
acre-feet
that
the
other
states
could
claim
against
this
under
the
limitation
was
effective
by
the
magnitude
of
the
uses
on
the
gila
river.
we
agree
with
that,
so
she
is,
but
arizona
at
that
time
contented
that
are
uses
on
the
gila
should
not
be
measured
by
the
quantity
diverted
unless
a
quantity
return
to
the
stream
but
should
instead
be
measured
by
the
much
lesser
amount
by
which
those
uses
depleted
the
flow
of
the
colorado
river
to
mexican
boundary.
now,
a
difference
--
not
to
dwell
on
it,
the
difference
is
that
in
that
state
of
nature,
part
of
the
water
that
arizona
diverts
in
phoenix
area
but
never
reach
mexico
because
it
would
have
been
burned
out
by
evaporation.
the
master
decides
that
under
the
compact
and
under
the
project
act
both
consumptive
use
means
the
quantity
use
measured
at
the
site
of
use
which
we
contend
diversions
less
returns
to
the
river.
now,
the
figure
of
2,000,00
acre-feet
that
i've
used
repeatedly
with
respect
to
the
quantities
of
the
uses
on
the
tributaries,
i
do
not
represent
to
you,
it
was
given
the
finding
by
the
master's
is
not.
it
is
a
figure
which
is
the
quantity
developed
by
from
two
sources.
one,
the
arizona
pleadings,
the
other
is
the
california
proof.
arizona
alleged
that
measured
by
depletion,
the
uses
on
the
gila
were
about
1,000,000
acre-feet
measured
by
diversions
less
return.
there
were
approximately
1,0000,000
more
than
that
or
about
2,000,000
or
a
proof
developed
that
the
safe
annual
deal,
the
dependable
supply
of
a
gila
river
fully
use
now
in
arizona
is
of
nevada
--
new
mexico
is
of
the
order
of
1,750,000
acre-feet,
and
the
uses
on
the
other
tributary
are
about
200,000.
those
are
our
figures.
they're
not
the
master's
but
they
are
supported
by
the
arizona
pleadings.
now,
i
have
repeatedly
refer
to
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
your
honor
if
--
if
the
project
act
the
limitation
uses
the
expression
article
3
--
paragraph
(a)
of
article
3
compact
as
truly
meaning
what
the
compact
means
as
a
master
founds,
the
mainstream
plus
tributaries.
then
the
uses
on
the
tributary
is
our
accountable
against
this
7,500,000
3
(a)
water
which
the
lower
basin
may
claim
and
we
can
claim
only
5,500,000
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
red
river,
the
mainstream.
if
they
figure
was
not
2,000,000,
but
1,000,000
or
1,500,000,
it
would
by
just
that
quantity
effect
the
residue
of
3a
water
that
we
could
claim
out
of
the
main
river.
also
another
point
that
i
should
have
made
clear
i
--
i
try
to
but
it
is
the
distinction
between
consumptive
use.
the
figure
i
just
that
--
phrase
i
just
used,
and
the
flow
of
the
stream.
now,
the
master
did
that
in
the
quotation
that
i
read
to
you
supply,
article
iii
(d)
cannot
be
correlative
with
iii
(a).
the
flow
of
the
stream
at
a
given
point
that
has
--
is
not
--
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
quantity
of
beneficial
consumptive
use.
it's
a
little
bit
the
different
stream
gross
income
and
net
income.
7,500,000
acre-feet
flowing
at
lee
ferry
that
flow
the
resource
will
not
sustain
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
diversions
less
returns
at
any
point
down
stream
because
our
losses
between
lee
ferry
and
point
of
diversion.
and
moreover,
the
quantity
that
returns
to
the
stream
after
it's
diverted
is
credit
against
that
diversion,
and
arriving
that
the
net
consumptive
use.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
water
that
inevitably
reaches
mexico
and
the
form
of
return
flow
from
the
american
projects,
nothing
you
could
do
about
it.
that's
a
great
part
of
the
source
from
mexico
is
deducted
from
a
total
diverted
in
the
united
states
to
arrive
at
the
beneficial
consumptive
use.
another
point
that
has
been
mentioned
here
about
upper
basin
depletions,
upper
basin
expansion,
i
should
be
--
to
make
it
very
clear.
the
master
declined
to
let
us
entered
this
evidence
on
that
point.
when
the
--
we
first
discovered
from
his
report
that
he
regarded
the
rate
of
upper
basin
depletions
as
a
material,
as
relevant
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
shortage
under
his
formula
because
there
is
nothing
to
show
how
rapidly
the
upper
basin
were
developed.
we
ask
lee
to
present
evidence
upon
that.
the
only
evidence
we
had
offered
or
referred
during
the
trial
he'd
excluded
and
he
declined
to
permit
the
trial
of
reopen
to
take
testimony
upon
that.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
the
relevance
we
saw
in
it
was
simply
to
answer
his
assertion
of
impossibility
of
shortage
that
his
formula
should
not
be
measured
by
its
effect
because
the
effect
we
saw
was
based
upon
the
enforcement
of
the
compact
and
there's
no
likelihood
the
compact
ever
be
enforced,
nothing
to
show
the
upper
basin
every
use
so
much
water.
in
other
words,
if
the
point
he
made
against
this
is
relevant
that
there's
no
possibility
of
shortage
because
the
compact
never
be
enforced,
we
thought
it
relevant,
have
an
opportunity
to
rebut
that
by
in
the
form
of
the
chart
that
i
showed
you
a
few
minutes
ago
that
the
upper
basin
can
expand
at
all
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
without
an
--
pardon.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
no,
he
do
that
from
a
senate
committee
report
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
pardon
me?
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
yes,
your
honor,
but
one
written
with
respect
to
legislation
long
since
(inaudible),
a
projection
of
upper
basin
expansion
which
is
obsolete.
and
he
refused
to
receive
evidence
upon
the
current
expectations,
the
current
estimates
that
are
on
the
same
categories
to
report
you're
relied
upon.
mr.
attorney
general
he
didn't
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
the
way
i
read
it
for,
he
excluded
it
because
he
had
--
he
was
in
fact
making
a
finding
on
that.
he
didn't
call
of
that
but
there's
nothing
to
show
that
for
the
foreseeable
--
the
unforeseeable
future,
their
uses
never
rise
about
4,800,00
acre-feet.
well,
even
if
that
resolved.
the
figures
i
showed
you
on
the
chart,
(inaudible)
the
chart
please.
the
figures
i
showed
on
the
chart
little
while
ago
to
make
it
clear
that
if
they
got
up
to
4,800,000
acre-feet,
they
have
to
invoke
this
compact
sidings
upon
us.
they
have
available
--
they
have
available
total,
one
of
the
most
optimistic
estimate
of
water
supply
5,200,000
and
3,100,000
more
estimates.
at
the
beginning,
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
attorney
general
mosk
the
question
on
the
proportion
of
in-base
and
an
out-base
and
use
in
the
california,
the
total
quantity
of
water
that
we
divert
in
california
to
points
of
views
where
it
cannot
return
to
the
stream
amounts
to
something
like
90%
of
a
total
that
california
would
divert
for
all
of
our
projects.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
--
may
have
the
may
(inaudible).
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
great
california
projects
are
the
metropolitan
water
districts
colorado
river
aqueduct
and
the
all-american
canal,
a
metropolitan
aqueduct
takes
water
to
the
coastal
plain
of
southern
california
and
metropolitan
cannot
return
to
the
colorado
river.
the
imperial
valley
and
the
coachella
valley
are
the
large
part
below
sea
level.
they
are
--
by
some
definitions
within
the
colorado
river
basin
because
the
colorado
has
flowed
into
them,
we
do
so
again
if
not
to
kept
out,
but
they
--
it
has
been
kept
out
successfully
for
half
century
or
more
and
if
the
your
--
the
water
taking
into
those
valleys
of
course
cannot
return
to
river.
so
that
--
the
literal
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
douglas
is
about
90%.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
i
don't
think
so,
and
i
don't
think
it
should
have.
as
i
started
to
--
to
say
earlier,
this
--
with
respect
to
the
priority
a
problem,
if
it
were
not
through
the
compact
or
the
project
act
or
the
limitation
act,
it's
only
unquestionable
that
the
--
the
controlling
rule
here
would
be
the
equitable
apportionment
rule
of
which
priority
of
appropriation
is
primary
element,
protection
of
existing
uses
a
second.
there
are
other
factors
but
those
two,
of
course,
we
think
controlling.
now,
what
the
master
has
done
with
respect
to
river
basin
as
a
lower
basin
as
a
whole
is
this.
he
has
applied
the
rule
of
equitable
apportionment
on
the
gila
river
system.
the
gila
as
raises
as
you
will
note
in
western
new
mexico,
flows
clear
across
to
arizona
and
into
the
main
river
near
yuma.
he
says,
“there
is
no
compact
between
new
mexico
and
arizona.”
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
is
not
effect
raised
between
two
states.
he
applies
the
rule
of
equitable
apportionment.
priorities
are
enforced
except
existing
uses
in
new
mexico
and
existing
economies,
although
based
on
junior
uses
is
not
to
be
destroyed.
he
makes
an
excellent
exposition,
a
quotation
of
the
rule
of
equitable
apportionment
at
page
316
and
again
at
page
326
to
328.
i
won't
stop
to
agree
with
them.
now,
he
applies
also
the
rule
of
priority
of
a
proportion,
equitable
apportionment
between
the
users
on
the
--
from
the
main
river,
mainstreams
as
he
calls,
the
red
area
and
users
who
may
divert
above
the
lake
mead.
that
is
to
say
the
california
projects
that
are
required
a
pro-rate
denied
the
priorities
as
against
a
competing
arizona
project
right
across
the
river
from
them
may
nevertheless
enforce
those
same
priorities
even
though
derive,
the
water
right
maybe
derive
entirely
from
a
contract
of
united
states
against
a
new
diverter
above
lake
mead,
and
note
what
that
means.
if
arizona,
he
elects
to
build
a
central
arizona
project
by
diversions
from
bridge
canyon
or
marble
canyon
shown
in
--
by
the
blue
doted
lines
on
the
map
behind
me.
then
california
may
--
by
the
express
language
in
the
report,
bring
a
new
action,
i
suppose
in
this
court
to
enjoin
that
diversion
because
it
is
junior
to
our
projects
and
because
it
is
specifically
outside
the
scope
of
this
decree.
our
priorities
are
intact
against
that
diversion
above
lake
mead.
but
if
arizona
elects
to
build
the
central
arizona
project
by
the
diversion
shown
in
the
red,
which
would
take
off
from
parker
dam
near
the
bill
williams
river,
then
that
diversion
is
to
then
the
arizona
apportionment
made
by
the
decree
and
it
then
the
shortage
will
prorate
against
it.
he
applies
the
--
he
--
he
retains
the
doctrine
of
priority
of
appropriation
with
respect
to
what
he
calls
present
perfected
rights
even
interstate.
by
that
he
means,
he
says,
“the
quantity
of
water
which
a
project
had
in
fact
put
to
use
on
the
effective
date
of
the
project
act
and
the
compact,
june
25,
1929.”
the
quantity
of
water
which
have
been
put
to
use
up
to
that
date
is
a
"present
perfected
right,“
and
it's
priority
intestate
is
protected.
if
there
is
not
enough
water
to
satisfy
the
present
perfected
rights,
the
appropriative
rights
based
on
state
law
in
arizona,
california
and
nevada,
priority
of
appropriation
control
strictly.
the
junior
is
yield,
the
seniors
are
protected.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
by
capacity
of
approximate
5,400,000
acre-feet,
i
mean
the
present
existing
capacity.
the
capacity
of
our
work
--
mr.
attorney
general
at
this
time,
yes
sir.
yes,
you
honor.
there
are
--
are
--
mr.
attorney
general
pardon
me.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
the
capacity
in
existence
in
1929
by
our
propose
findings
conclusion,
not
the
master's
figure
but
ours,
it
was
about
3,700,000
acre-feet.
and
we
had
in
fact
put
to
use
applied
through
those
works
about
3,300,000
acre-feet
prior
to
1929.
as
of
the
same
date,
arizona
had
put
to
use
about
250,000
acre-feet
in
1929
and
nevada
nothing.
consequently,
we're
dealing
here
with
an
allocation
which
--
which
text
projects
in
two
categories.
one,
the
uses
which
had
in
fact
been
made
prior
to
the
construction
of
hoover
dam
without
the
assistance
of
storage,
that
figure
is
to
be
determine
says
the
master
in
supplementary
proceedings
after
this
decree.
if
we
cannot
agree
upon
it,
then
we
bring
--
come
back
to
court
and
have
to
determine.
the
definition
he
gives,
however,
is
quantity
in
fact
use
prior
to
1929,
not
the
capacity
of
the
works
in
but
the
quantity
in
fact
used.
now,
the
quantity
in
fact
used
in
1929,
the
arizona
pleadings
concede
california
was
used
in
approximately
3,000,000
acre-feet,
2,900,000,
we
say
somewhat
more
3,300,000.
arizona
does
not
claim
of
use
prior
the
storage,
construction
of
storage
more
than
250,000.
now,
this
produces,
if
i
may
just
a
moment,
some
very
resting
comparisons
upon
what's
done
--
what's
done
with
the
allocation
of
the
benefits
of
hoover
dams
storage?s
ubtract
these
quantities
i
have
given
you.3,000,000
for
california,
from
--
even
4,400,000
for
california
and
you
discover
that
about
a
third
of
the
water
we
can
get
is
made
available
by
the
construction
of
the
hoover
dam.
if
we're
limited
by
the
compact
to
the
6,500,000
from
the
main
river
and
we
get
4470
feet
of
it
or
3,800,000
acre-feet,
then
the
net
advantage
we
have
got
out
of
the
construction
of
hoover
dam
is
something
less
than
300
--
then
800,000
acre-feet
perhaps,
a
500,000.
by
contrast,
arizona
which
was
use
in,
perhaps,
250,000
before
hoover
dam
was
built
would
get
out
of
the
same
6,500,000
acre-feet
about
2,400,000
or
about
2,000,000
acre-feet
of
the
benefits
storage.
the
benefits
of
storage
are
allocated
between
the
states
in
such
fashion
that
virtually
all
of
the
incremental
new
water
made
available
by
the
construction
of
hoover
dam
goes
to
arizona
and
nevada
and
in
minimum
of
it
to
california.
but
the
effect
of
the
master's
formula,
is
that
if
--
in
event
of
shortage,
if
there
isn't
7,500,000
acre-feet
for
these
three
states,
california
bears
44/75ths
or
59%
of
that
shortage.
out
of
6,500,000
acre-feet
that
the
river
may
make
available
to
the
lower
basin,
we're
in
fact
to
allocate
it
about
20%
of
the
new
storage
water,
20%,
and
arizona,
nevada
about
80%.but
if
there
is
shortage,
we
bear
59%
of
that
shortage.
now
that
is
the
effect
of
enforcement
of
proration,
a
proration
under
a
formula
which
treats
our
present
perfected
rights
but
exactly
the
same
way
as
a
paper
appropriation
on
the
new
state
within
the
quantities
and
uses
as
nominator
and
denominator
of
this
fraction.
while
he
respects
present
perfected
rights
as
a
floor
beyond
law
which
we
cannot
go
when
it
comes
to
wait
in
them,
to
wait
in
them
in
the
proration,
he
picks
in
exactly
so
their
paper
appropriations.
it's
a
little
bit
--
mr.
attorney
general
pardon.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
this
mr.
justice
black
that
if
there
is
less
than
7,500,000
acre-feet,
we
take
the
figure
6,500,000.
we're
going
to
get
44/75ths
of
that
or
3,800,000.
it
makes
no
difference
to
him
that
of
that
3,800,000,
3,000,000
or
more
was
present
perfected
rights
that
we
have
before
a
storage
was
constructed,
and
it
makes
no
difference
to
him
that
out
of
the
2,400,000
arizona
would
get
practically
all
of
it
is
new
storage
water
because
she
had
perfected
uses
of
only
250,000.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
oh
you're
right
for
uses
on
the
tributaries.
the
gila
was
fully
appropriated
in
1929
and
virtue
of
the
use,
we
find
there
are
now
existed
down.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
no
you
honor.
throughout
my
discussion
at
this
moment,
i
have
used
his
--
his
time
in
1929,
no
sir.
we
do
not
--
what
i'm
talking
about
here
is
phraseology,
yes
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
no.
you
note
that
the
effect
of
what
he
says,
the
protection
he
purports
to
give
present
perfected
right
simply
means
this,
“no
state
is
going
to
be
deprived
to
the
water
for
present
perfected
rights
that
as
it
uses
as
of
1929
but
add
them
up.”
we
claim
or
we're
using
the
--
perhaps
3,300,000,
the
arizona
250,000
and
nevada
nothing.
he
gives
the
indians
a
present
perfected
right
as
of
the
date
of
creation
of
the
reservation
whether
they
ever
used
a
drop
to
this
day
or
not.
if
you
add
those
in,
that's
600,000
for
arizona
but
you
still
have
a
figure
that's
less
than
4,000,000
acre-feet
for
all
the
present
perfected
rights
in
all
three
states
from
the
main
river.
now,
if
that
so,
the
protection
for
present
perfected
rights
is
an
illusion
because
under
nobody's
estimate
is
the
water
supply
a
projected
to
a
figure
down
to
4,000,000
acre-feet.
what
we
complain
about
is
having
given
us
the
point.
the
present
perfected
rights
were
not
to
be
destroyed.
he
then
puts
him
into
an
equation
on
proration
with
precisely
the
same
effect
as
it
paper
appropriation
or
project,
nobody
heard
any
yet.
a
little
bit
as
all
we
--
yes,
you're
deciding
what
to
do
whether
in
solving
the
state
and
they
had
stocks
and
bonds
to
deal
with
and
you
announced
it
this
state
is
going
to
be
disposed
off
in
such
a
way
that
the
bonds
are
going
to
get
paid.
that's
the
present
perfected
rights
and
it's
a
very
good
announcement.
but
in
the
second
paragraph,
you
say
that
the
total
assets
that
have
gone
of
the
state
are
going
to
be
distributed
in
proportion
of
the
total
amount
of
securities
held
by
each
creditor.
and
it
turns
out
therefore
that
you're
giving
exactly
the
same
weight
to
a
common
stock
or
debenture
that
you
do
to
a
first
mortgage
bond.
that's
what
he
does
to
present
perfected
rights
here.
the
fact
that
out
of
california's
4,400,000
over
3,000,000
is
present
perfected
rights
and
only
a
marginal
part
of
its
total,
it
doesn't
effect
even
the
slightest.
in
event
of
shortage,
in
event
of
shortage,
we
assure
that
shortage
44/75ths
although
the
storage
made
possible
on
the
portion
of
that
4,400,000.
but
to
go
on,
what
he
does
with
the
doctrine
of
priority
of
appropriation,
priority
of
appropriation
often
continuous
to
apply
intrastate,
intrastate
between
competing
projects
within
arizona,
between
competing
projects
on
the
california
side
of
the
line.
it
stops
its
state
line
accept
for
present
perfected
rights,
except
for
claims
against
the
diverters
above
hoover
dam.
and
furthermore
and
this
is
significant,
furthermore,
these
priorities
are
protected
intrastate
and
against
users
above
hoover
dam
even
though
they
are
generated
by
federal
water
delivery
contracts
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
appropriation
ever
made
under
state
law.
consequently,
the
issue
of
whether
--
the
issue
of
whether
priority
survived
interstate
does
not
depend
upon
whether
the
water
right
asserted
is
derived
from
an
appropriation
made
under
the
laws
of
the
state
or
whether
it
is
generated
by
a
contract
made
with
the
united
states
because
contract
generated
rights
are
protected
as
to
their
priorities
against
other
rights
within
the
same
state.
contract
generator
priorities
are
protected
against
users
above
hoover
dam.
it
is
only
when
they're
in
conflict,
this
conflict
between
two
users
on
opposite
side
of
the
river
glaring
to
each
other,
each
with
the
contract,
reach
without
a
contract
that
you
get
into
the
question
of
proration.
this
creates
some
very
curious
hybrid
results.
he
says
specifically
that
the
limitation
did
not
cut
off
california's
rights
against
the
substantial
tributary
employee
calls
above
lake
mead.
nothing
on
our
contracts
does
that
and
nothing
in
the
limitation
act
raised
those
priorities.
we'll
visualize
if
you
will
then
a
suit
by
california
against
a
new
diversion
above
lake
mead.
central
arizona
project
decides
to
build
there.
the
issue
is
tried
on
a
basis
of
priorities.
we
prevail
that
headgate
had
shutdown.
the
water
must
come
down
into
lake
mead.
what
happens
to
it?
it
commingles,
he
says
with
the
waters
in
the
lake
may
be
released
only
under
the
secretary's
contracts
and
that
--
that
having
happen,
it
comes
up
pro
rata.
so
having
one
in
our
case
against
the
junior
diversion
above
lake
mead,
we
get
to
keep
44/75ths
of
the
water
we
want
and
arizona
takes
2875ths
of
it
even
though
for
the
benefit
of
a
project
in
arizona
below
hoover
dam
junior
to
the
one
we've
just
deputed
in
this
hypothetical
suit.
take
the
bill
williams
river,
little
stream
that
comes
in
at
--
just
above
the
point
where
this
lower
central
arizona
project
diversion
will
take
off.
it's
not
a
big
stream
but
it
contributes
more
water
than
utah
and
new
mexico,
have
claimed
or
have
used
out
of
the
whole
colorado
river
system.
if
their
claims
are
de
minimis
and
so
as
it
has
some
vice
versa.
mr.
attorney
general
it
rises
in
arizona,
yes
sir.
now,
that
stream,
he
treats
as
so
it
came
into
the
river
above
lake
mead.
he
says
its
de
minimis
of
congress
apparently
overlook
it
and
intended
to
treat
that
as
stored
water,
it's
control
by
this
water
contracts
even
though
the
contracts
call
for
water
released
from
lake
mead
and
even
though
bill
williams
river
comes
in
below.
well,
you
imagine
the
water
uses
on
the
bill
williams
river.
if
they
use
the
water
before
it
gets
into
the
mainstream,
its
tributaries
not
chargeable
of
arizona's
2,800,000.
if
they
don't,
it
reaches
the
main
river
then
it
is
chargeable
or
by
diversions
from
the
central
arizona
project
below
the
bill
williams.
now,
the
master's
report
in
other
words,
it
projects
a
hybrid
system
of
water
rights,
never
before
seen
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
country.
let
me
come
to
the
basic
--
the
basic
difference
between
the
priority
and
the
proration
rule.
may
i
have
the
map
proceedings?
mr.
attorney
general
it
ran
into
service
in
1941.
it
commenced
in
1932.
mr.
attorney
general
in
the
same
year
of
1941.
it
commenced
in
1932
and
1933.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
that
matters
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
i
should
have
explained.
now,
let
me
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
attorney
general
the
all-american
canal
takes
off
that
imperial
dam
that
parallels
the
river
to
a
point
just
above
the
mexican
boundary
turns
west
and
that
carries
water
into
the
imperial
and
coachella
valleys,
the
point.
there's
a
--
the
division
point,
the
junction
that
you
referred
to
is
that
of
the
coachella
branch
which
takes
water
around
the
salton
sea
depression
and
into
the
coachella
valley,
the
coachella
valley
being
to
the
north
and
west
of
imperial
valley.
the
--
this
whole
area
is
below
sea
level.
the
water
is
taken
by
gravity.
the
valley
extends
into
mexico.
it's
called
the
mexicali
valley
and
before
the
construction
of
hoover
dam,
the
river
when
it
could
broke
through
into
this
area
instead
of
the
sea.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct
sir.
they
break
at
the
river
in
1905.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
--
that
is
correct
sir.
the
coachella
branches
a
long
branch
of
120
miles.
mr.
attorney
general
very
little.
it
was
litigated.
a
lot
of
evidence
went
in
on
it.
the
problem
in
a
nutshell
is
simply
this
that
the
river
carries
a
lot
of
salt,
about
a
ton
of
salt
for
acre-foot
of
water.
a
farmer
who
applies
for
a
ton
of
the
four
acre-feet
of
water
to
168-acre
farm
is
adding
640
tons
of
salt
per
year
to
his
farm.
he
has
to
get
rid
of
it.
that's
a
lot
of
salt.
mr.
attorney
general
they
have
drainage
facilities
that
lich
the
water
through
the
soil
and
take
out
the
salt.
with
the
result
that
into
the
salton
sea,
there
must
go
about
a
fifth
of
the
water
that's
diverted
from
the
colorado
river
to
carry
out
this
salt
or
agriculture
sewage
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
otherwise,
the
soil
salts
up
and
becomes
outline
and
no
good.
now,
what
the
--
consequently,
the
water
requirements
of
the
imperial
valley
cannot
be
reckoned
simply
as
the
quantity
of
water
that
maybe
burned
up
by
the
plant.
you
have
to
add
through
it
the
water
you
must
necessarily
waste
out
just
human
waste
and
sewage
from
the
city
to
the
sea.
that's
one
reason
why
a
consumptive
use
is
reckoned
as
diversion
is
less
returns.
if
you
don't
have
returns,
you
have
a
project
of
the
short
line.
the
--
all
of
the
california
projects,
i
should've
added
response
to
the
earlier
question
were
originated
long
before
1929.
the
palo
verde
project
in
1877,
the
metropolitan
water
district
of
colorado
river
aqueduct
by
appropriations
under
state
law
in
1923
and
1924
and
1926,
and
actually
some
$2,000,000
have
been
spent
on
those
--
that
project
before
the
project
act
was
passed.
mr.
attorney
general
the
colorado
river
aqueduct
of
the
metropolitan
water
district.
the
imperial
irrigation
district,
the
imperial
valley
had
been
irrigated
since
1901
under
the
state
law
appropriations
made
in
the
1900s.
the
coachella
valley
was
included
in
those
appropriations
but
the
water
did
not
reach
it
until
the
all-american
canal
was
built.
these
were
all
very
old
--
very
old
rights.
the
yuma
project
is
--
i
should've
mentioned,
the
yuma
project
is
a
federal
reclamation
project
that
straddles
the
colorado
river.
the
bigger
portion
is
in
arizona.
there
is
small
area
in
california
that
has
been
served
by
diversions
in
colorado
since
about
1905.
now,
the
question
of
salt
that
mr.
justice
douglas
raised
which
has
recently
been
agitated
by
mexico
is
simply
this.
the
drainage
works
have
been
constructed
on
arizona
side
from
the
wellton-mohawk
project
whose
name
is
not
given
here
but
it
is
in
the
cluster
of
dots
shown
on
the
map
where
on
yuma.
that
carries
very
heavy
salt
--
salty
water
back
into
the
river
at
a
point
where
it
close
in
new
mexico
and
the
mexicans
as
result
are
getting
water
that
have
very
bad
quality.
and
the
mexican
water
treaty
of
1944
during
ratification
proceeding,
this
issue
of
quality
of
water
was
agitated.
and
at
that
time,
it
was
apparent
that
from
the
reports
of
the
negotiators
to
the
two
countries
that
there
is
a
wide
difference
on
what
they're
reporting.
the
american
negotiators
say
that
mexico
had
to
take
water
of
any
quality.
the
mexican
negotiator
is
reporting
that
wasn't
so.
they
were
entitled
to
the
water
of
good
quality.
the
water
they're
getting
now
they
say
is
a
very
bad
quality
and
they
want
something
done
about
it.
and
all
you
can
do
--
all
you
can
do
when
you've
been
encountered
that
kind
of
a
problem
that
are
force
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
water
is
give
more
water
of
the
less
salt
contents,
whatever
it
result.
so
the
mexican
burden
--
the
mexican
burden
is
one
of
the
liabilities
that
is
not
fully
probed
in
this
litigation.
we
know
that
the
water
reaching
mexico
must
exceed
the
treaty
quantity
of
500,000
acre-feet
for
the
mechanical
reason
that
you
can't
--
you
can't
exactly
control
it.
you
control
it
at
davis
dams
on
150
to
200
miles
upstream
and
you
can't
meter
--
meter
it
out
at
davis
precisely
to
meet
the
demand
150
to
200
miles
below.
and
beside
that,
if
mexico
prevails
in
improving
and
getting
better
water,
we
have
to
add
too
that
often.
mr.
attorney
general
the
--
yes.
the
water
is
diverted
into
this
yuma
--
wellton-mohawk
area
at
imperial
dam
and
it's
--
the
drainage
comes
back
in
at
a
lower
point
for
above
mexico.
but
i
think
the
imperial
valley
which
diverts
over
3,000,00
acre-feet
a
year,
that's
over
3,000,000
tons
of
salt
and
figure
how
many
train
loads
will
it
take
to
haul
it
away,
weren't
disposed
of
hydraulically
in
the
salton
sea
and
gets
the
idea
of
our
necessity
of
having
great
return
flow.
mr.
attorney
general
well
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
it's
in
the
--
all
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river.
the
river
of
this
sort
carries
some
natural
salt
but
has
its
supply
the
irrigation
in
the
upper
basin
and
then
successive
projects
below,
it
becomes
saltier
and
saltier.
it
takes
salt
out
of
the
soils.
with
the
result
by
the
time
it
reaches
the
lowest
one
abbreviation,
it's
--
it's
a
very
bad
quality.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
if
i
may
have
a
(inaudible)
again,
please.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
thank
you
mr.
gindler.
i
just
mentioned
the
same
point
to
me,
no
sir.
it
means
the
--
the
sailing
content,
their
magnesium
salts,
sodium
salts,
they
are
primarily
chlorides
but
there
are
many
other
radicals
involved
and
the
type
of
salt
that's
concerned
also
is
vast
important
somewhere,
not
volatile
as
others
are.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
it
is
not.
nacl
is
not
sodium
chloride.
there
are
sodium
chlorides
in
it
but
their
magnesium
chlorides
and
calcium
chlorides.
mr.
attorney
general
salt
in
sea
is
the
residue
of
colorado
river
water
that
came
in
there
and
bygone
centuries
evaporated,
left
great
salt
that's
now
has
received
new
colorado
river
water.
so
its
content
reflects
the
accumulated
salts
of
bygone
archeological
time
as
well
as
the
present.
the
colorado
river
compact
and
boulder
canyon
project
act,
the
california
limitation
act,
all
came
into
existence
against
the
background
of
the
existence
in
the
west
as
a
way
of
life
of
the
law
priority
of
appropriation.
and
this
doctrine,
you're
familiar
with
but
the
elements
of
it
are
that
he
who's
first
in
time
is
first
in
right.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
as
the
doctrine
of
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
you
used
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
which
we
invites
you
to
use
here
that
it
is
modified
to
protect
junior
of
uses
whereof
an
existing
economy
is
based
upon,
and
the
master
applies
that
as
i've
indicated
on
the
--
on
the
gila
river.
now,
the
doctrine
has
several
elements.
the
first
is
he
who
was
first
in
time
is
first
in
the
right
of
priority
of
appropriation,
and
another
element
is
a
doctrine
in
relation
back.
if
you
have
initiated
a
right
and
pursued
it
with
due
diligence,
then
your
right
is
measured,
not
by
the
quantity.
you
in
fact
have
put
to
use
as
of
the
given
date,
june
25,
1929
for
example
but
by
the
quantity
you
ultimately
have
put
to
use
with
due
diligence
and
that
right
relates
back
to
the
date
of
inception,
the
date
of
initiation.
that's
important
because
any
municipality
that
doesn't
plan
ahead
25
years
for
the
protection
of
its
people
is
that
being
badly
planned.
every
aqueduct
is
built,
not
to
their
crimes
of
today
only
if
it
doesn't,
it
obsolete
tomorrow.
it
is
built
for
the
requirements
of
the
future.
and
when
that
capacity
is
finally
build
up
before
use,
the
water
right
relates
back
in
its
entirety
to
the
date
of
inception.
this
doctrine
as
a
--
this
court
has
said
in
the
beaver
portland
cement
case
and
the
gerlach
case
came
into
existence
by
a
necessity.
in
california,
when
the
gold
is
discovered
at
about
the
same
time,
the
miners
discovered
the
necessity
of
the
use
of
water,
sometimes
at
a
distance
from
the
stream.
it
had
to
be
taken
in
flumes
and
the
doctrine
of
priority
of
preemption
with
respect
to
mining
of
properties
and
with
respect
to
the
water
necessary
for
their
use
developed
simultaneously
and
put
it
very
simply.
in
the
west,
you
don't
jump
a
mining
claim
and
you
don't
jump
on
appropriative
right.
having
established
by
self-help,
by
appropriation,
it
is
yours
provided
you
continue
to
use
that
resource
of
diligence.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
right.
mr.
attorney
general
that
was
the
rule
that
colorado
contended
for
in
colorado
versus
kansas,
wyoming
versus
colorado
that
the
upstream
sovereign
had
a
right
to
retain.
it's
not
really
riparian
or
appropriative
in
sort
of
a
sovereign
concept.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir.
and
that
has
been
thoroughly
upset
throughout
these
western
states.
every
one
of
them
has
abrogated
the
rule
of
priority
--
rule
of
riparianism.
every
one
of
them
within
its
domestic
law
has
adapted
the
rule
of
priority
of
appropriation.
if
this
for
one
state
involved
here
on
both
sides
of
the
colorado
river,
there's
only
one
rule
that
we
apply
priority
of
appropriation,
unquestionably.
this
court
applied
priority
across
state
lines
on
wyoming
versus
colorado.
now,
the
beginning
before
of
this
century,
development
had
come
about
on
the
colorado
river.
the
developments
of
the
imperial
valley,
i
have
spoken
off,
was
a
development
of
an
area
that
could
be
readily
water,
expansion
made
possible
by
gravity
irrigation
but
it's
also
below
sea
level
and
threatened
by
floods.
so
that
early
in
this
century,
they
developed
the
gradual
consciousness
of
a
need
for
flood
control,
a
storage
dam
on
the
colorado
river.
by
1920,
that
had
become
an
overpowering
--
overpowering
dried.
there
was
national
consciousness
of
a
need
for
flood
control.
the
upper
basin
states,
wyoming
and
colorado,
new
mexico
and
utah
were
vastly
disturbed
about
the
possibility
of
the
building
of
a
great
storage
dam
on
the
lower
river.
the
natural
flow
had
long
since
it's
been
appropriated.
if
a
dam
was
built
which
had
its
stored
waters,
that
stored
water
too
would
be
appropriated
by
this
--
in
this
lower
country
and
if
their
projects
came
along
later,
junior
projects,
they
would
find
themselves
denied
in
water
by
the
operation
of
the
lower
priority
of
appropriation.
the
colorado
river
compact
and
consequently
be
visualized
as
a
--
as
a
price
demanded
by
the
four
upper
states
for
their
political
acquiescence
in
the
construction
of
hoover
dam
or
any
dam
in
the
lower
basin.
and
we
may
turn
briefly
to
the
provisions
of
the
compact
the
page
--
it
starts
at
page
371.
you'll
find
here
the
document
that
finally
came
out
of
these
negotiations
in
november
1922.
this
compact
makes
a
division
of
the
great
colorado
river
basin
into
two
parts,
an
upper
basin
and
the
lower
basin
divided
by
a
point
on
the
main
river
at
lee
ferry,
which
is
in
northern
arizona.
the
area
draining
into
the
stream
above
that
or
which
can
be
used
water
from
that
area
is
called
the
upper
basin.
i'll
pause
there
in
a
minute.
this
means
that
denver,
which
is
outside
the
natural
drainage
basin,
is
within
the
upper
basin
as
defined
by
the
compact.
it
means
in
los
angeles,
which
is
outside
the
drainage
basin
of
the
lower
basin
is
within
the
--
the
lower
basin
as
so
defined.
this
reflects
that
philosophy
of
another
element
of
the
law
of
appropriation.
the
riparian
right
could
be
used
only
by
the
user
located
on
whose
land
was
about
in
the
stream.
that's
not
adaptable
to
the
needs
of
people
for
water
in
the
west.
they're
located
not
along
the
streams
but
at
a
distance.
the
law
of
appropriation
permits
the
water
to
be
taken
from
water
--
one
water
shed
into
another.
that
is
another
great
distinction
between
them.
the
fact
that
the
metropolitan
area
is
outside
the
drainage
basin,
there's
wholly
consistent
with
the
law
of
priority
of
appropriation.
denver
is
taking
the
water
from
outside
the
basin.
the
central
utah
area
will
take
water
from
outside
the
basin.
that
is
a
necessity
of
life
in
the
west.
the
compact
reflects
that.
the
heart
of
a
compact
is
article
iii.
you
have
--
you
seen
earlier
today
in
this
reprint
article
iii
(a)
which
apportions
to
the
upper
basin
and
the
lower
basin,
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system.
it
defines
--
it
has
already
defined
that
colorado
river
system
has
meeting
the
drainage
area.
the
colorado
river
system
in
ii
(a)
is
defined
as
that
portion
of
the
colorado
river
and
its
tributaries
within
the
united
states
of
america
and
its
tributaries
as
a
claim.
article
iii
(a)
apportions
from
that
same
colorado
river
system
7,500,000
acre-feet
to
the
upper
basin,
to
the
lower.
mr.
attorney
general
wyoming
has
tributaries
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
exactly
so,
exactly.
that
is
true
of
wyoming
and
it
is
true
of
new
mexico.
neither
of
those
states
have
any
access
to
the
main
river.
you're
quite
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
pause
here
to
say
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
uses
colorado
river
and
colorado
river
system,
colorado
river
and
its
tributaries
in
general
its
interchangeable
terms.
everywhere
--
everywhere
throughout
the
documents
then
describing
is
a
system
--
a
system
compact,
not
a
main
river
compact.
on
article
iii
(b),
it
gives
the
lower
basin
the
right
to
increase
its
use
by
1,000,000
acre-feet
per
annum.
well,
if,
however,
in
iii
(a)
and
iii
(b)
through
into
one
article,
8,500,000.
the
reason
seems
to
be
--
it
seems
to
be
that
article
iii
(b)
is
not
treated
as
a
perpetual
apportionment
at
all.
but
if
the
lower
basin
has
in
fact
used
this
7,500,000
then
it
can
put
the
added
million
acre-feet
to
use
because
of
the
problem
encountered
in
article
iii
(c)
of
the
next
article.
article
iii
(c)
provides
that
if
we
make
a
treaty
with
mexico,
mexico
is
to
be
satisfied
first
out
of
the
waters
that
are
surplus
to
those
specified
in
articles
iii
(a)
and
(b).
that
is
surplus
to
16,000,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use.
but
if
that
surplus
isn't
enough,
then
the
two
basins
are
to
contribute
equally
to
bear-in
the
deficiency.
now,
let
me
pause
there
to
point
out
the
significance
of
that.
if
the
tributaries
are
included
as
a
compact
so
claim
he
says
in
the
accounting,
then,
2,000,000
acre-feet
of
useless
in
the
lower
basin
tributaries
are
chargeable,
accountable
against
the
lower
basin
in
deciding
how
to
divide
up
this
mexican
burden.
if
a
2,000,000
acre-feet
or
lower
basin
tributaries
didn't
exist,
if
you
excluded
them
from
the
accounting,
then
the
upper
basin
is
in
trouble
because
it
must
contribute
at
an
earlier
level
than
--
than
otherwise.
if
we
have
2,000,000
acre-feet
of
uses
on
the
tributaries,
that's
part
of
the
resource
which
we're
accountable,
then
it
is
to
the
upper
basin's
advantage
of
course
to
have
those
tributaries
included
in
the
accounting,
and
they
were
insistent
upon
it
for
22
years.
that
is
why
arizona
rejected
the
colorado
river
compact
because
the
tributaries
are
so
plainly
included
within
its
scope.
and
if
the
lower
basin
is
accountable
to
the
upper
basin
for
the
fact
that
arizona
is
getting
the
advantages
out
of
the
tributaries
then
he
can
be
very
sure
that
in
any
accounting
between
arizona
and
california,
which
had
the
effect
of
restricting
to
6,500,000
acre-feet
what
the
states
in
combination
will
take
out
of
the
main
river,
arizona
was
accountable
for
those
same
advantages,
those
same
benefits.
and
for
that
very
reason,
no
part
of
this
compact
for
22
years,
it's
because
the
tributaries
were
included.
article
iii
(d)
provides
that
the
states
of
the
upper
division,
that's
colorado
and
new
mexico,
utah
and
wyoming
will
not
deplete
the
flow
at
lee
ferry
below
75,000,000
acre-feet
every
10
years,
that
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
article
iii
(a).
article
iii
(a)
encompasses
the
uses
on
the
tributaries.
it
deals
in
diversions
less
returns.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
75,000,000
acre
flow
or
acre-feet
of
flow
at
a
distant
point
lee
ferry
upstream
on
the
main
river.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
arizona
contends
that
the
iii
(b)
and
iii
(a)
as
to
remedies
and
moreover
that
iii
(b)
can
be
claimed
at
lee
ferry
too.
mr.
attorney
general
article
iii
(e),
(f)
and
(g)
are
importance,
with
peripheral
importance,
the
points
i
want
to
make
here.
the
heart
of
the
--
the
heart
a
compact
is
this
article
iii
and
the
heart
of
article
iii
is
the
deliberate
decision
to
include
the
tributaries
in
the
accounting.
now,
you
could
have
written
the
compact
obviously
that
they're
only
lee
ferry.
they
didn't
do
it.
they
deliberately
included
the
tributaries.
that's
in
the
compact.
that's
in
the
document
of
which
the
limitation,
the
california
limitation
in
the
section
4
(a)
makes
cause
reference.
that
is
a
point
of
which
the
master's
says
the
project
act
made
in
inappropriate
reference
because
the
limitation
doesn't
include
these
tributaries.
mr.
attorney
general
i
didn't.
excuse
me,
i
did
not
hear
you
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
at
the
article
ii
(a)
of
the
compact
finds
the
colorado
river
system
to
do
so.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
it
is
define
in
two-way
and
the
master
specifically
interprets
the
compact
at
the
--
to
just
as
i
described
it
as
including
the
tributaries.
he
says
at
page
142
and
23,
“the
limits
established
by
the
compact
on
the
acquisition
of
appropriative
rights
were
applicable
to
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river
and
to
its
tributaries.
and
at
the
later
point,
the
plain
words
of
the
compact
permit
only
one
interpretation
on
article
iii
(a),
(b),
(c),
(f)
and
(g),
deal
with
both
the
mainstream
and
the
tributaries.”
and
he
says
on
page
143,
“the
various
arguments
of
arizona
failed
before
this
unmistakable
language
of
the
compact.
the
historical
fact
that
the
upper
basin
was
primarily
concerned
with
the
mainstream
will
not
nullify
a
language
of
the
compact
that
subjugates
both
mainstream
and
tributaries
to
its
rule,
nor
is
the
argument
persuasive
that
because
some
provisions
deal
only
with
the
mainstream,
all
provisions
are
so
limited.”
now
the
--
after
the
other
states
have
verified
in
1923,
arizona
rejected
it.
i
say
rejected
advisedly
because
that
is
the
word
this
court
uses
in
referring
to
it
in
decisions
all
come
to
later
283
u.s.
the
reason
arizona
refused
to
ratify
the
compact
is
the
précised
one
that
the
compact
include
the
tributaries
specifically
the
gila.
the
other
states
in
1925
adopted
the
statutes
which
recognized
a
political
fact
of
life
that
arizona
was
not
going
to
ratify
the
compact
that
the
boulder
canyon
project,
if
it
was
going
to
get
built,
it's
going
to
be
authorized
by
a
statute
that
it's
either
going
to
accept
six
states
as
a
membership
of
the
compact
or
not
yet
passed
at
all.
consequently,
the
other
states
passed
statutes
that
waived.
the
requirement
of
seven
ratifies
and
in
fact
converted
the
colorado
river
compact
into
a
six
state
compact
by
reciprocal
legislation.
when
this
came
before
the
congress,
it
resulted
in
the
inclusion
and
the
project
act
of
the
alternative
provisions
i
have
referred
to
in
section
4
(a),
the
reprint
you
have,
which
provide
either
for
the
required
at
the
--
as
the
condition
proceeding
one
of
two
things,
either
seven
states
ratification
in
whichever
that
everybody
is
happy
or
failing
that
six
state
ratification
and
in
that
event,
passage
by
california,
this
limitation
act.
that
was
the
alternative
that
went
into
the
--
into
the
project
act.
now,
as
a
result
of
this
language
of
section
4
(a),
california
on
march
4,
1929
passed
two
statutes.
one
was
a
statute
that
ratified
the
colorado
river
compact
and
the
six
states
agreement
all
over
again.
the
other
was
in
limitation
act.
both
passed
on
march
4,
1929.
they
have
a
very
narrow
and
tight
question
statutory
interpretation.
in
the
california
statute
that
ratifies
the
colorado
river
compact
as
a
six
states
agreement,
the
compact
has
set
forth,
and
the
limitation
act
appears
the
same
language,
4,400,000
acre-feet
of
the
waters
apportionment
of
the
lower
basin
states
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
the
narrow
question
is
that
the
california
legislature
in
passing
these
two
statutes
on
the
same
day
used
in
one
of
them
the
expression
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact
as
encompassing
the
tributaries
in
which
event
we
were
assuming
as
against
the
upper
basin
the
inclusion
of
the
tributaries
and
the
accounting
which
respect
to
the
mexican
burden.
and
on
the
same
day,
passed
the
statute
that
said
with
respect
to
arizona
exclude
those
tributaries,
article
iii
(a)
is
inappropriate
reference.
now,
that
is
a
problem
before
the
court.
does
this
language
and
the
underscore,
on
reprint
you
have
before
you,
we
repeated
in
the
heichberger,
the
california
limitation
act
mean
it
when
it
says
4,400,00
acre-feet
of
the
waters
apportioned
of
the
lower
basin
states
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact?
if
it
does,
it
includes
a
system,
the
tributaries.
if
it
does
then
the
3,100,000
from
which
were
precluded
in
--
i
include
also
arizona's
uses
all
of
those
same
tributaries.
if
it
doesn't,
as
the
master
believes,
then
that
3,100,000
we
can't
take
and
be
asserted
against
the
red
river
from
lake
mead
below.
yes,
let's
get
the
--
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
not
over
in
oklahoma.
now
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
right.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
we
are
quite
content
to
meet
the
problem
on
either
those
basis.
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
that
is
true.
that
is
because
our
statute
is
the
operating
statute
and
the
master
has
plainly
says
with
respect
to
the
uses
above
lake
mead
and
that
is
the
tributaries
to
come
in.
he
says,
“it
is
inconceivable
that
the
california
legislature
and
the
california
senators
have
voted
for
the
bill
intended
to
waive
california's
priorities
against
this
substantial
tributary
inflow.”
he
looks
to
the
intent
of
the
california
legislature.
we
do
too,
then
we
say
it's
even
more
inconceivable
that
the
california
legislature
intended
not
only
waive
its
priorities
against
the
substantial
tributary
inflow
above
lake
mead
but
to
leave
all
of
that
resource
out
of
the
accounting
and
furthermore,
to
waive
the
same
priorities
against
the
projects
across
the
river.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
well
it
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
don't
recall
that
at
all.
i
don't
recall
that
at
all.
so
i
said,
it
refer
to
meet
the
problem
on
the
basins
being
intended
either
of
the
--
either
the
two
suburbs.
but
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize
is
if
this
is
an
agreement,
it
is
a
statutory
compact
enacted
by
reciprocal
legislation.
statutory
compact
is
what
arizona
called
in
their
briefs
here
on
a
previous
occasion.
it's
a
good
expression
point.
take
a
look
at
the
sort
of
language
that's
used,
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
page
of
this
reprint
in
italic.
the
state
of
california
is
required
by
--
act
of
its
legislature
to
do
something.
what
is
it?
it
shall
agree
irrevocably
and
unconditionally
with
the
united
states
as
an
agreement
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
states
of
arizona,
colorado,
nevada
and
new
mexico,
utah
and
wyoming,
third-party
beneficiaries.
as
an
expressed
covenant,
more
contract
language
and
in
consideration
of
the
passage
of
this
act
that
the
aggregate
annual
consumptive
use
and
so
on
shall
be
restricted.
now,
the
problem
is
what
is
the
statutory
compact
between
these
two
sovereigns?
the
master
believes
that
the
underscored
language
on
the
second
page
starting
with
the
item
one
has
this
effect
that
the
california
legislature,
when
it
passed
the
statute
accepting
this
offer
and
that
congress
is
making
the
offer,
intended
that
the
word
“compact”
which
appears
three
times
in
the
last
half
dozen
lines,
4,400,000
acre-feet
of
the
waters
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
states
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
that
time,
the
word
“compact”
doesn't
mean
compact
at
all
at
shorthand,
shorthand
for
7,500,000
acre-feet
in
the
red
river,
lake
mead
to
the
mexican
body.
the
second
time
it's
used
plus
not
more
than
one
half
of
any
excess
or
surplus
waters
apportioned
by
it
said
compact.
that's
an
inappropriate
reference
too.
that
means
shorthand
for
the
red
river.
but,
such
users
always
to
be
subject
to
the
terms
of
said
compact.
the
third
time
is
used
compact
means
compact.
this
time,
we
mean
the
colorado
river
compact.
well,
this
is
an
extraordinary
piece
of
statutory
construction.
it
is
repeal,
wholly
contrary
to
the
whole
purpose
of
the
requirement
of
the
limitation.
what
was
that
purpose?
it's
written
into
the
act
by
upper
basin
senators,
fearful.
now,
the
seven
states
compact
would
not
come
about
a
six
states
compact
plus
the
limitation
had
to
be
in
substitute.
you
cannot
get
the
equivalent
of
a
seven
states
compact
by
the
device
of
a
six
states
compact
plus
a
limitation
act
that
uses
with
respect
to
limitation
at
entirely
different
body
of
water.
why
struggled?
why
struggled
to
include
the
tributaries
in
the
colorado
river
compact
with
the
protection
of
the
upper
basin
if
we're
going
to
exclude
them
in
the
one
--
in
the
whole
boulder
canyon
project
that
worth
counts
most?
mainly,
the
situation
where
arizona
won't
ratify
this
compact
and
you
have
to
protect
the
upper
basin
by
the
best
way
you
can.
let
me
illustrate,
in
the
bridge
of
the
river
from
the
lake
mead
to
lee
ferry,
that
is
the
blue
area
above
the
red.
at
the
time,
the
project
act
was
under
consideration,
diversions
were
being
planned
both
by
arizona
and
by
california.
the
metropolitan
water
district
had
under
review
four
routes
for
its
great
project,
a
great
aqueduct
to
the
california
coastal
plain.
one
of
them
would
have
taken
off
from
bridge
canyon
then
the
gravity
route.
mr.
attorney
general
it
is
a
feasible
engineering
and
feasible
route,
right
away
problems
of
arizona,
of
course
our
major
problems.
but
so
far
as
the
engineering
is
concerned,
that
is
a
quite
a
feasible
route.
mr.
attorney
general
oh
yes.
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
but
two
arizona
senators
cameroon
(ph)
and
ashurst
both
speeches
to
senate
in
1927
and
1928
said,
“this
is
the
place
where
the
colorado
river
aqueduct
should
diver,
bridge
canyon.
we
don't
want
any
dam
at
black
canyon
inside
the
hoover
dam
at
all.
we
don't
want
it.
we
will
go
along
with
the
dam
at
bridge
canyon,
which
can
divert
for
los
angeles
there.”
it
was
a
possibility
and
it
was
not
abandoned
for
many
years,
it
avoids
all
pumping.
at
the
same
time
in
arizona,
they
have
remained
what
it
called
the
quarter
filings
were
out
giant
project
that
divert
in
the
same
bridge
of
the
river,
the
grandfather
of
the
central
arizona
project.
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
upper
basin
senators
would
have
intended
to
redefine
the
article
iii
(a)
of
the
colorado
river
compact
so
as
to
mean
a
red
river,
lake
mead
to
mexico.
nobody
knew
where
hoover
dam
is
going
to
be.
it
might
build
it
upstream
with
black
canyon
or
boulder
canyon.
the
compact
talks
about
a
damn
in
the
upper
basin
for
the
benefit
of
the
lower,
meaning
glen
canyon
dam.
and
you
don't
--
as
i
say,
you
avoid
the
whole
purpose
of
the
colorado
river
compact
if
you
exclude
the
gila
river
and
the
other
tributaries.
now,
the
senators
very
carefully
wrote
into
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
in
any
number
of
places
that
the
colorado
river
compact
should
control
despite
anything
it
might
be
said
in
this
act.
if
you'll
turn
to
page
389,
here,
you'll
find
section
8
(a)
of
the
project
act,
the
united
states,
its
permits,
licensees
and
contractees,
and
all
users
and
proprietors
of
water
stored,
diverted
carrying
and
so
on.
it
shall
be
subject
to
in
control
by
the
colorado
river
compact
and
the
construction
management,
operation
and
said
reservoir
canal,
other
works
and
so
on.
and
then
the
third
line
from
the
end,
anything
in
this
act
to
the
contrary
not
withstands
in
all
permits,
licenses,
and
contracts
are
so
provide.
and
in
the
13
(b),
the
rights
of
the
united
states,
they
entered
to
two
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
and
its
tributaries
also
river
claimed
were
required,
as
well
as
the
rights
of
those
claiming
under
the
united
states
shall
be
subject
to
in
control
by
said
colorado
river
compact,
the
13
(c)
and
13
(d)
for
the
same
effect.
now,
it
is
inconceivable.
it
is
inconceivable
that
it
was
intended
in
congress
in
the
one
place
where
encountered
most
to
redefine
article
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
compact.
specific
articles
of
the
compact
are
referred
to
specifically
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
on
a
number
of
occasions,
several
times
in
the
same
section
4
(a).
it
refers
to
article
11,
article
3
(a)
and
another
paragraph
refers
to
article
3
(c).
it's
incredible
draftsmanship
to
assume
that
in
this
one
plate
crucial
place,
article
iii
(a)
doesn't
mean
iii
(a)
for
something
else.
now
also,
respect
to
the
function
of
the
limitation
act,
just
protection
in
the
lower
basin.
arizona
knew
it
was
feasible
that
we
were
thinking
about
diversions
of
above
lake
mead
for
the
colorado
river
aqueduct.
the
two
arizona
senators
were
inviting
us
to
do
that.
it
was
a
limitation
assuming
that
to
be
written
for
arizona's
benefit
intended
to
exempt
to
california
diversions
above
lake
mead.
it
is
not
an
inviting
piece
of
construction.
actually,
the
bridge
to
the
main
river
from
the
lee
ferry
to
lake
mead
is
one
further
that
the
whole
length
of
the
river
from
lee
ferry
to
mexico.
now,
the
reasons
that
the
master
gives
for
rejecting
the
language
of
section
4
(a)
of
declining
to
give
what
the
meaning
that
they
agreed
from
the
natural
reading
of
the
words
is
this.
he
says
that
--
pardon
me.
he
says
that
the
debates
indicate
that
the
senators
were
contemplating
the
division
of
7,500,000
acre-feet
from
the
mainstream,
the
main
river.
that
the
second
paragraph
in
section
4
(a)
provides
authority
for
compact
among
arizona,
california
and
nevada,
which
would
only
operated
on
the
main
river.
and
that
consequently,
he
must
reject
the
literal
language,
the
plain
language
of
the
act
and
look
to
the
debates.
now,
let
us
look
first
at
the
--
at
the
language
of
what
these
senators
said.
the
--
it
is
quite
true
--
it
is
quite
true
that
in
the
debates
on
the
boulder
canyon
project
act,
you'll
find
considerable
confusion
but
the
confusion
is
this.
some
senators
whom
a
--
special
master
quotes,
senator
pittman
in
particular,
senator
hayden,
unquestioned
were
talking
on
the
assumption
that
the
article
iii
(a),
not
the
same
thing
as
article
iii
(b),
the
flow
at
lee
ferry.
the
master
rejects
that
literal
language
of
the
debates
like
he
rejects
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
but
all
of
this
--
all
of
this
business
of
what
was
meant
by
article
iii
(a)
was
cleared
up
like
a
flash
of
lightning
by
author
of
the
--
of
the
limitation
amendments.
senator
phipps
of
colorado
after
this
debate
had
indicated,
developing
confusion
as
to
what
they
meant
by
this
limitation.
“what
are
you
doing
about
the
tributaries?
what
are
you
doing
about
the
gila?”
this
is
a
language
with
the
senator
phipps
used.
it
is
in
california
as
opening
brief
at
pages
118
and
119.
what
happen
was
that
the
fifth
amendment
which
brought
this
limitation
into
being
was
before
the
senate,
senator
phipps,
was
the
chairman
of
the
reporting
committee,
the
author
of
the
amendment,
spokesman
of
the
upper
basin
has
to
perfected
at
the
time
he
did
so.
the
language
instead
of
saying
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
said
simply
the
waters
apportion
to
the
lower
basin.
senator
phipps
said
this,
“referring
to
the
amendment
which
is
now
before
the
senate
in
order
to
remove
any
possible
misunderstanding
regarding
the
4,400,000
acre-feet
of
water,
i
had
desired
to
perfect
the
amendment
by
inserting
on
page
3
line
4
after
the
word
by,
the
words
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
so
that
it
will
show
that
that
allocation
of
water
refers
directly
to
the
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
water
that
are
mentioned
in
paragraph
3.”
if
you
refer
now
to
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact,
there's
only
7,500,000
acre-feet
mentioned
in
the
article
iii,
that
is
iii
(a).
he
was
making
its
specific
but
he
was
looking
to
that
resource
as
the
one
to
which
the
limitation.
on
california,
it
was
applicable
and
hence,
it
is
that
resource
against
which
the
3,100,000
acre-feet
that
were
excluded.
mr.
attorney
general
there's
only
--
mr.
attorney
general
well
if
you
look
at
article
--
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii,
you
look
at
article
iii
as
a
whole,
there
is
only
one
7,500,000
acre-feet
--
mr.
attorney
general
there
is
no
other
7,500,000
acre-feet
mentioned
in
the
article
iii,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
phipps
said
that
earlier
said
that
arizona
is
entitled
to
have
the
gila
taken
into
account.
there's
no
question
in
the
world
that
phipps
was
intending
to
rate
in
to
the
limitation.
the
same
function
at
the
upper
basin
had
insisted
on
writing
into
article
iii
of
the
compact.
the
lower
basin
tributaries
have
got
to
be
included.
here's
what
phipps
said,
earlier
said,
this
is
on
page
121
of
our
opening
brief
--
page
120.
he
says
at
the
top
of
page
121,
“for
years
passed,
at
least
some
of
the
waters
in
the
gila
river
have
come
into
the
canal
that
is
now
supplying
the
imperial
valley.
it
is
not
a
definite
fixed
pack
that
where
the
enactment
of
this
proposed
legislation.
the
all-american
canal
is
going
to
be
build
within
the
period
of
70
years.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
may
not
be
rebuilt
at
all.
we
do
not
know
as
to
that.”
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
water
from
the
gila
river,
one
of
the
main
tributaries
of
the
colorado,
should
be
eliminated
from
consideration.
i
think
that
california
is
entitled
to
have
that
account
again
as
being
a
part
of
the
basic
supply
of
nature.
but
in
offering
this
protecting
amendment,
he
wasn't
protecting
our
interest,
he's
protecting
his
own.
you
cannot
get
the
result
of
the
colorado
river
compact
in
protecting
the
upper
basin
against
3
(c)
the
obligation
of
new
mexico
unless
you
charge
the
lower
basin
with
the
uses
on
the
tributaries.
now,
the
other
reason
the
master
gives
for
rejecting
the
literal
language
of
the
first
paragraph
of
article
--
section
4
(a)
is
the
authorization
for
a
tri-state
compact
found
in
the
second
paragraph,
which
is
also
in
the
reprint
you
have
before
you.
here,
the
third
of
arizona's
filibusters
against
the
boulder
canyon
project,
the
swing-johnson
bill
was
terminated
by
an
agreement
of
the
senate
to
accept
senator
hayden's
amendment
that
which
is
the
second
paragraph.
as
originally
drafted,
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
condition
preceded
like
the
first
one
provided
that
the
statute,
the
project
act
should
not
take
effect
unless
california
would
agree
to
this
too,
water
for
arizona
and
nevada.
as
finally
amended
on
a
senate
floor,
it
was
amended
to
make
it
wholly
permissive.
mr.
attorney
general
section
4
(a),
it
is
on
the
reprint
before
you
on
page
2.
it
is
in
the
--
on
the
master's
report
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
under
project
act
at
a
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir,
commenced
at
the
bottom
of
page
382.
now,
before
getting
to
the
substance
of
it,
let
me
tell
you
what
the
senate
did
with
it
before
it
passed
it.
the
--
after
considerable
debate,
senator
pittman
prevailed
upon
senator
hayden
to
modify
by
making
it
wholly
permissive.
and
the
--
this
was
the
language
of
the
colloquy
which
brought
that
about.
the
language
of
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
was
accepted
as
an
amendment
to
the
project
act
by
senator
johnson
between
the
bill's
order
and
became
a
part
of
the
bill
upon
the
following
representations,
“colloquy.”
mr.
johnson,
“i
want
to
make
clear
that
this
amendment
shall
not
be
construed
hereafter
by
any
of
the
parties
to
it
or
any
of
the
states
as
being
the
expression
of
the
will
or
the
demand
or
the
request
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.”
mr.
pittman,
“exactly
not.”
mr.
johnson,
“very
well
then.”
mr.
pittman,
“it
is
not
the
request
for
congress.”
mr.
johnson,
“i
accept
the
amendment
then.”
no
senator
voiced
any
objection
to
that
amendment.
mr.
attorney
general
this
was
--
senator
pittman
explained
simply
a
consent
in
advance
to
a
contract
versus
three
legislatures
might
then
put
in
to
effect
by
reciprocal
legislation.
they're
about
to
be
in
recession.
if
they
choose
to
do
so
and
their
time
would
be
save.
they
wouldn't
have
to
sign
a
treaty
and
bring
it
back
for
ratification.
and
he
explained
that
was
he's
only
purpose
to
save
time.
the
legislature
might
or
might
not
accept
this
but
if
they
did,
time
will
be
saved.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
senator
bratton
made
that
point
and
the
there
was
a--
i
won't
say
a
division,
almost
unanimity
among
the
senators
who
expressed
themselves
that
the
congress
could
not
divide
or
allocate
the
water
at
all,
that
it
had
to
be
by
interstate
compact
and
the
question
was
a
wisdom.
senator
bratton
said,
“the
spelling
out
to
the
state
in
advance
and
what
they
should
do.”
mr.
attorney
general
well
--
mr.
attorney
general
they
did
not
allocated
in
the
4
(a).
mr.
attorney
general
in
the
second
paragraph
--
in
the
second
component
of
the
limitation
in
section
4
(a),
they
provided
that
california
should
limit
theirselves
to
one
half
of
the
surplus.
by
agreement
of
the
california
legislature,
the
operating
language
is
not
that
of
congress
which
says,
“we
do
know
here
now
divide
the
water.
if
they
had
intended
to
do
that,
there
is
no
necessity
for
requiring
california's
legislature
to
agree
with.”
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct
sir.
this
was
a
--
by
plainly,
this
is
as
its
--
the
introductory
language
says,
“the
states
of
arizona,
california
and
nevada
are
authorized
to
enter
into
an
agreement
to
do
the
following.
there
is
nothing
compulsory
about
it.
it
had
been
originally
written
as
a
condition.”
the
action
not
effect
unless
california
so
agrees
that
was
deleted
on
the
senate
floor
by
senator
hayden
and
the
author
after
senator
pittman
had
persuaded
into,
and
then
follow
the
colloquy
between
pittman
and
johnson.
this
is
not
the
request
to
the
demand
of
the
congress
at
all.
mr.
attorney
general
not
under
--
it's
not
on
the
second
paragraph
that
which
i'm
just
referring
at
all,
it's
wholly
inoperative.
under
the
first
paragraph,
we
would
be
entitled
under
the
law
of
appropriation
to
far
more
than
4,400,000
acre-feet
are
appropriations
vastly
exceeded
that.
we
are
restricted
to
4,400,000.
let
me
make
this
clear.
we
do
not
say
that
the
first
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
is
in
a
grant
or
a
patent
to
california
of
anything.
it
is
the
limitation,
the
master
is
correct
and
so
constraint.
it
is
a
limitation
upon
california's
rights,
which
absence
the
limitation
would
be
greater,
would
be
greater
under
the
law
of
equitable
apportionment.
our
appropriations
then
in
existence
were
greater
and
on
any
bases
of
estimate.
we
were
--
could
have
taken
from
this
river
more
than
we
can
now
take
under
the
limitation.
the
limitation
cut
us
down.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
we
raised
before
we
do,
we
raised
the
point,
your
honor
that
since
it
was
exactly
devoirs
on
the
--
if
arizona
refused
to
ratify
the
compact,
then
if
arizona
is
now
construed
to
ratify
as
the
master
said
she
did,
22
years
after
in
1944,
then
we
should
--
we
held
to
this
limitation.
he
says,
“no,
you're
bound
by
it”
and
we
intend
to
carry
out
our
obligations.
we
--
our
legislature
enacted
this.
we
build
our
projects
at
the
time
it
was
enforced
and
we
do
not
ask
that
--
that
it'd
be
--
that
it'd
be
lifted
promise.
we
do
not
welsh
on
it.
we
asked
that
we
be
entitled
to
the
--
to
take
what
they're
up
to,
what
the
limitation
gave
us
and
that
the
statutory
compact
be
respected
by
the
united
states
as
it
is
by
us.
but
the
second
paragraph
is
wholly
inoperative.
this
compact
was
never
signed
by
any
state,
never
ratified
by
any
state.
it
is
a
proposed
--
that
is
a
proposed
compact
that
all
three
states
want
to
know
part
of,
arizona
alone,
but
the
three
of
them
passed
an
act
even
before
it
even
it
ratified.
and
that
was
in
1939
and
she
amended
it,
amended
it
in
the
vital
particular
of
saying
and
in
addition
the
gila
river
before
she'd
pass
it.
now,
the
second
paragraph,
the
master
feels
should
be
used
as
a
dictionary
to
construed
the
first
paragraph.
if
you
look
at
the
second
paragraph,
it
is
not
a
useful
or
valuable
dictionary.
in
the
first
place,
it's
not
operative,
there
is
no
such
compact.
in
the
second
place
if
hey
--
it
has
no
water
at
all
into
california,
not
a
drop,
nothing
for
new
mexico,
nothing
for
utah.
it's
all
efforts
to
amend
this
or
tear
it
up
seize
when
it
was
made
permissive
and
who
cared
what
it
said,
the
legislature
didn't
have
to
take
it.
but,
if
the
first
paragraph
as
the
master
holds
is
just
the
limitation
on
california,
then
the
second
paragraph
is
just
a
limitation
on
arizona
and
nevada
to
gives
them
nothing,
gives
them
nothing.
now,
the
master
treats
the
references
to
2,800,000
for
arizona
and
300,000
for
nevada
in
the
second
paragraph
as
meaning,
the
congress
intended,
the
congress
intended
that
these
two
quantities
in
california's
4,400,000
all
have
to
be
come
out
of
the
main
river
below
lake
mead,
below
lake
mead,
the
red
river.
now,
if
that
so,
this
would
have
been
one
of
the
most
curious
compacts
ever
signed,
ever
ratified
by
anybody.
can
you
imagine
a
compact
that
spelled
out
the
implications
the
master
finds
here?
namely,
that
if
arizona
diverts
in
the
flung
third
of
the
main
river
from
the
lee
ferry
to
lake
mead,
what
she
takes
there
shall
not
be
charge
against
the
2,800,000
acre-feet
under
this
hypothetical
compact
where
she
takes
it
below
lake
mead
and
(inaudible).
she
can
take
as
much
as
she
likes
above
no
matter
how
much
it
diminishes
a
common
resource
but
not
to
be
charged
with
it.
and
furthermore,
how
can
you
possibly
reconcile
--
reconcile
a
divorce
of
the
limitation
from
the
compact
in
the
teeth
of
the
provisions
of
the
clause
6
of
this
proposed
compact
on
page
3
of
my
reprint,
that
all
the
provisions
are
said
price
state
agreement
shall
be
subject
in
all
particulars
to
the
provisions
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
clause
7,
said,
agreement
to
take
effect
upon
the
ratification
the
colorado
river
compact
by
arizona,
california
and
nevada.
now,
the
master
says,
the
master
says
in
page
173
that
i
read
at
the
beginning
this
morning
that
the
project
act
in
section
4
(a)
use
a
reference
to
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
as
shorthand,
that
his
expression
shorthand
for
7,500,000
acre-feet
in
the
main
river,
the
red
river
from
lake
mead
to
mexico.
now,
these
three
legislatures
were
authorized
by
the
second
paragraph
to
enter
into
a
compact
provided
it
was
exactly
as
written
in
heichberger
here.
is
it
sensible
to
say
that
not
only
it
was
congress
talking
in
shorthand
in
the
first
paragraph
to
the
legislature
of
california
and
california
responded
in
shorthand?
but
moreover,
if
these
three
states
of
legislatures
adopted
the
compact
to
the
second
paragraph,
they're
supposed
to
be
talking
in
shorthand
in
each
other
too
by
using
a
cryptogram.
when
they
say
at
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
compact,
which
by
definition
includes
tributaries,
all
four
sovereigns
concerned,
congress,
the
three
state
legislatures,
all
are
presumed
to
be
using
that
shorthand
for
something
quite
different.
it
is
a
remark
it
will
be
at
statutory
construction.
the
true
--
the
true
dictionary
here
isn't
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
(a)
at
all.it's
the
section
13
(b).
the
rights
of
the
united
states,
that's
at
page
393
and
394.
the
rights
of
the
united
states
in
or
two
waters
of
the
colorado
river
and
its
tributaries,
and
its
tributaries,
howsoever,
claimed
or
acquired
as
well
as
the
rights
of
those
claiming
under
the
united
states
shall
be
subject
to
in
control
by
the
said
colorado
river
compact.
so
much
then
for
the
limitation,
the
limitation
issue
has
repairs
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
project
act.
senator
phipps
making
as
clear
as
a
man
could
make
it
what
they
offer
to
california
map.
what
body
of
water
he's
talking
about?
the
master
rejecting,
rejecting
the
alternative
interpretation
that
senator
hayden
and
senator
pittman
gave.
it'll
maybe
useful
to
site
you
the
master's
characterization
of
what
they
were
saying.
at
pages
189
and
190
--
mr.
attorney
general
no,
excuse
me
of
the
master's
report,
at
189
excuse
me,
189
and
190.
here,
the
master
discussing
the
origin
of
the
figures
that
were
being
quoted
on
the
limitation.
the
conference
about
provision
of
the
governors
in
1927
had
proposed
a
formula.
it
was
related
to
the
division
of
the
3d
water,
the
water
of
the
upper
basin
let
down
at
lee
ferry.
the
master
says
after
quoting
the
report
from
a
remark
from
senator
pittman,
it
was
quoted
from
governor's
recommendations.
he
says,
“this
report
by
senator
pittman
did
not
adopt
or
perhaps
fail
the
grass
that
portion
of
the
governor's
resolution
which
expressly
found
the
source
of
the
allocated
waters
in
the
article
iii
(d)
obligation
of
the
upper
division,
instead
senator
pittman
related
the
limitation
article
iii
(a),
not
iii
(d),”
and
he
quotes
senator
pittman.
on
page
190
near
the
top
he
said,
“thus
senator
pittman
used
article
iii
(a)
to
define
this
--
the
area
against
which
the
limitation
was
to
operate.
he
did
this
in
apparent
misunderstanding
of
the
governor's
recommendation.”
all
subsequent
discussion
in
the
senate
flowed
in
the
same
channel.
here,
we're
dealing
with
the
debate
that
the
master
characterized
were
confused
and
he
doesn't
--
he
does
not
adopt
the
interpretation
that
pittman
is
giving
namely
that
the
iii
(a)
equals
iii
(d).
he
rejects
that
completely.
having
rejected
it,
there
is
not
a
single
word
in
the
legislative
history,
the
project
act
to
support
the
master's
truncation
of
the
colorado
river
at
lake
mead.
true
enough,
you'll
find
senators
who
thought
iii
(a)
was
the
same
thing
as
iii
(d).
true
enough,
you'll
find
senator
phipps
rejecting
and
correcting
that,
iii
(a)
means
the
tributaries.
you
will
not
find
one
senator,
you'll
not
find
one
word
of
support
for
the
notion
that
the
senate
of
the
united
states
intended
to
divide
this
river
at
lake
mead,
either
lee
ferry
or
include
the
tributaries
but
nobody
said
the
red
river.
now,
the
other
element
of
the
statutory
compact
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is
a
priority
feature.
the
master's
concept
is
at
section
5
of
the
project
act,
which
is
in
the
reprint
before
you,
delegated
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
authority
to
“impose
a
federal
apportionment,”
on
the
states
if
they
fail
to
enter
into
a
compact,
and
that
the
secretary
by
its
water
deliver
contracts
in
later
use
did
that.
the
master
rejects
arizona's
contention
that
section
4
(a)
which
we've
just
left
creates
a
mandatory
formula,
a
mandatory
formula
that
the
secretary's
bounded
putting
into
effect
but
the
states
didn't
accept
it.
he
--
in
doing
so,
he
relies
upon
the
colloquy
i've
quoted.
he
says,
“i
have
rejected
the
contention
of
the
second
paragraph,
in
section
4
(a)
page
on
202.”
the
act
established
a
mandatory
form
and
they're
governing
them
out
of
water,
arizona
must
receive.
he
says
at
section
5,
“authorize
the
secretary
of
the
interior
by
in
his
discretion,
in
his
discretion
to
place
a
formula
in
effect.”
and
that
by
the
contract
as
secretary
later
made,
he
did
that.
and
at
that
the
conflict
of
the
contracts
of
the
secretary
were
--
what
i've
described
this
morning
namely
proration,
44/75ths,
28/75ths,
375ths
or
whatever
what
was
available.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
section
5
which
makes
any
such
delegation
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
record
is
replete
with
statements
by
senators
that
the
congress
did
not
have
the
power
to
divide
the
water,
they
--
as
replete
with
the
assurances
that
we're
not
delegating
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
delegating
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
powers
that
they
refused
to
exercise
themselves.
here,
typical
expression,
senator
bratton
of
new
mexico,
they're
only
two
ways
known
to
me
through
which
titled
the
water
of
an
interstate
stream
either
for
purposes
of
irrigation
or
development
of
power
may
be
adjudicated.
one
is
by
a
contract
or
agreement,
the
method
sought
to
be
followed
in
this
case,
and
the
others
by
a
decree
rendered
in
a
suit
instituted
originally
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.”
here's
senator
king,
in
the
colloquy
of
hayden,
“if
the
senator
means
by
his
statement,”
as
the
king
speaking,
“that
the
federal
government
may
go
into
a
stream,
whether
it
be
the
colorado
river,
the
sacramento
river
or
a
river
in
the
state
of
montana
and
put
its
powerful
hands
down
upon
the
stream
and
say,
“this
is
mine.
i
can
build
a
dam
there
and
allocate
water
to
whom
i
please,
regardless
of
other
rights
either
suspended,
inquorate
or
perfected.
now,
i
deny
the
position
which
the
senator
takes.”
and
senator
hayden
said,
“the
amendment
that
i
have
offered
contemplates
no
such
possibility.”
that's
the
second
paragraph
of
section
4
(a).
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
no
your
honor,
in
response
to
senator
king's
comment,
one
week
later,
he
introduced
what
became
section
18
of
the
--
of
the
project
act.
and
that
says,
“nothing
herein
shall
be
construed
as
interfering
with
such
rights
as
the
states
now
have
either
to
the
waters
within
their
borders
or
to
adopt
such
policies
and
enact
such
laws
as
they're
may
be
necessary
with
respect
to
the
appropriation,
control,
and
use
of
waters
within
their
borders
except
as
modified
by
the
colorado
river
compact
through
other
interstate
agreement.”
now,
that
language,
it
was
construed
by
this
court
in
the
first
of
the
colorado
river
cases
here
283
u.s.
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
as
preserving
to
the
states
the
rights
of
control
of
appropriations
on
their
boundaries.
arizona's
raise
against
california
are
not
cut-off
or
perfected
by
the
project
act.
mr.
attorney
general
that
language,
your
honor
came
into
the
act
as
an
amendment
proposed
by
spokesman
for
the
upper
basin,
mr.
carpenter
of
colorado.
and
it
is
designed
to
require
that
no
land
may
use
waters
of
the
colorado
river
except
by
a
contract
which
in
turn
shall
contain
the
provisions
required
by
13
(b),
(c)
and
(d)
that
it
is
subject
to
and
in
control
by
the
colorado
river
compact.
that
is
no
use
in
arizona
could
escape
the
consequences
of
the
compact.
he
had
to
get
water
by
a
contract.
the
contract
had
to
contain
a
compact
--
a
compact
term.
here's
--
here
is
carpenter's
explanation.
except
by
a
contract
made
as
herein
stated
means
this,
”if
the
flow
of
the
colorado
river
is
controlled
and
regulated
by
the
constructions
of
black
canyon
dam
and
any
person
of
the
state
of
arizona
attempt
to
take
any
water
out
of
the
stream,
which
has
been
discharged
from
the
reservoir.
it's
been
carried
in
the
streambed
as
actual
conduit
but
(inaudible),
this
law
would
be
brought
into
effect
and
he
would
prevented
from
using
any
of
that
water
independent
with
colorado
river
compact
but
unencumbered
by
any
other
condition
for
the
benefit
of
california
and
nevada.”
in
other
words,
a
compact
does
not
disturb
the
right
--
does
not
disturb
the
rights
between
arizona,
california
and
nevada
intercedes
to
their
fortune
of
the
water.
the
thought
of
this
amendment
is
that
any
water
stored
in
this
reservoir,
under
the
terms
of
the
compact
when
released
through
storage
shall
be
burdened
by
the
compact
wherever
it
goes.
as
far
as
water
is
concerned,
existing
claims
of
the
lower
states
are
protected
by
the
compact
and
water
must
pass
through
this
reservoir
to
take
care
of
the
person
existing
to
lower
claims.
as
the
future
development
from
the
river,
we
insist
that
water
stored
in
this
structure
by
the
united
states
be
stored
and
released
upon
the
expressed
condition
that
the
persons
who
received
their
water
shall
respect
and
do
so
under
the
compact.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
interstate
relations
between
arizona
and
california.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
did
not
(inaudible)
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
right.
we
do
not
reach
the
constitutional
question,
arizona
does.
she
says,
“unless
you
take
the
--
the
section
4
(a)
as
a
mandatory
formula,
they're
not
sufficient
constitutional
guides
with
the
secretary
in
section
5.”
we
say
they
are
that
that
the
guide
is
in
the
reclamation
law,
section
8,
the
basic
19
to
reclamation
act.
that
is
a
statute
which
controls
stored
water
as
well
as
--
as
well
as
a
natural
--
use
of
natural
flow.
and
it
is
a
statute
that
says
that
the
right
to
the
use
of
water
acquired
under
the
provisions
of
this
act
as
a
reclamation
law
which
the
project
act
is
a
supplement,
shall
be
appurtenant
to
the
land
irrigated
and
beneficial
use
shall
be
the
basis,
the
measure
and
the
limit
of
the
right.
we
say
that
the
section
5
contracts
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
simply
initiate
perforations
under
federal
laws
stored
water
and
of
the
basis,
the
measure
and
the
limit
of
the
rights
so
acquired
is
a
quantity
of
water,
in
fact
put
to
use
as
it
would
be
under
a
state
law
of
corporation.
the
section
5
contracts
to
us
are
patents
or
grants.
they're
not
a
reversion
to
the
riparian
doctrine
of
--
that
you
may
have
something
that
you
can
be
a
dog
in
a
manger
about
you
can
keep.
it's
not
related
to
use.
the
right
has
measured
by
use
and
the
priorities
are
preserved.
now
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
if
we
--
mr.
attorney
general
if
we
accept
this
as
premises,
the
statutes
have
said
in
so
many
words,
the
water
is
divided
as
follows
among
these
three
states.
and
i
would
think
it
would
follow
that
the
secretary
would
be
--
be
so
bound
and
that
he
would
have
to
make
his
contracts
conform
to
those
three
quantities,
whether
you
call
them
limitations
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
when
you
call
graphs.
pardon?
mr.
attorney
general
under
the
statute
as
it
stands
now.
mr.
attorney
general
made
by
congress.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
suppose,
your
honor
depend
on
what
the
statute
said
is
to
with
respect
to
that
particular
point,
that
the
statute
said
the
secretary
shall
decide
who
gets
intrastate
so
be
it
if
the
statute
says
the
secretary
shall
deliberate
to
those
who
qualify
under
the
state
law,
so
be
it.
the
master
adopts
the
latter
interpretation
of
the
project
act.
the
state
law
controls
who
gets
it
within
the
state.
mr.
attorney
general
"you
have
to
have
both
valid
states
right
on
the
contract
to
get
the
water”,
says
the
master.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
there
--
mr.
attorney
general
no,
you're
substantially
right.
in
23
u.s.
arizona
suit
turn
to
join
the
colorado
river
compact
and
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
in
place
in
effect.
and
according
of
mr.
justice
brandeis'
opinion,
arizona
sought
regrets
against
two
ascertained
wrongs.
the
first
was
invasion
over
sovereignty
by
building
the
dam
and
now
hoover
dam,
and
the
second
was
the
threatened
invasion
of
arizona's
quasi-sovereign
right
to
prohibit
or
to
permit
appropriation
under
risk
laws
of
the
inappropriate
water
of
the
colorado
river
flowing
within
the
state.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first,
he
held
the
dam
could
be
built,
with
respect
the
second
after
defining
the
law
of
appropriation
is,
he
went
on
to
say,
“the
further
claim
is
that
mere
existence
of
the
act,
it
will
invade
quasi-sovereign
rights
of
arizona
by
preventing
the
state
in
exercising
its
right
to
prohibit
or
permit
under
two
laws,
the
appropriation
and
inappropriate
of
water
and
so
on.”
then,
he
quotes
section
18
of
the
act
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
right.
as
--
and
he
goes
on
to
conclude
as
we
hold
that
the
grant
of
authority
to
construct
the
dam
and
reservoirs
of
valid
exercise
of
the
congressional
power
that
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
does
not
purport
to
a
bridge,
the
right
of
arizona
to
make
or
permit
additional
and
appropriations
of
water
flowing
within
the
state
or
on
its
boundaries
and
that
there
is
now
no
threat
by
will
or
any
of
the
defendant's
states
to
do
any
act
which
will
interfere
with
the
enjoinment
of
any
present
or
future
appropriation.
we
have
no
occasion
to
consider
other
questions
which
it
has
been
argued.
the
bill
is
--
mr.
attorney
general
pardon
me?
mr.
attorney
general
well
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
it
goes
on
with
the
final
sentence
or
he
perhaps
clarifies
it.
he
says,
“the
bill
is
dismissed
without
prejudice
to
an
application
for
relief
in
case
the
stored
water,
the
stored
water
is
used
in
such
a
way
as
to
interfere
with
the
enjoinment
by
arizona
or
those
claiming
under
it
of
any
rights
already
perfected
or
with
the
right
of
arizona
to
make
additional,
legal
appropriations
and
to
enjoy
the
same.
now,
it's
--
mr.
attorney
general
well
clearly,
the
account
reconcile
judge
rikfkind's
holding
that
the
project
act
did
cut
off
the
right
of
the
appropriation
when
justice
brandeis'
statement
that
arizona
could
come
back
to
this
court
if
the
future
uses
stored
water
interfered
with
then
perfected
the
appropriations
to
right
to
make
further
ones.
if
judge
rifkind
is
right,
the
answer
in
283
u.s.
to
where
arizona
was
yes,
you're
qualified
now.
you
can't
come
back
to
complaint
of
appropriation
being
interfered
with
or
any
such
things
anymore.
mr.
attorney
general
i
can't
--
i
don't
have
the
qualification,
i
think
he's
very
careful
in
this.
here's
what
he
says
about
section
18.
what
this
court
says
through
mr.
justice
brandeis
at
page
262
and
23
u.s.,
“the
act
does
not
purport
to
effect
any
legal
right
of
the
state
or
to
limit
in
anyway
the
exercise
of
its
legal
right
to
appropriate
any
of
the
appropriated
9,000,000
acre-feet
which
made
flow
within
on
its
borders.”
on
the
contrary,
section
18,
specifically
declares
that
nothing
therein
shall
be
construed
as
interfering
with
such
rights
as
the
states
now
have,
either
to
the
waters
within
their
borders
or
to
adopt
such
policies
and
act
such
laws
as
they
may
deem
necessary,
with
respect
to
the
appropriation
control
and
use
of
water
within
their
borders
except
as
modified
by
the
interstate
agreement.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
it's
canvassed
to
say
but
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
--
mr.
attorney
general
not
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
he
was
dealing
with
issues
and
presented
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
and
the
arizona
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
right.
and
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
recall
sitting
in
this
courtroom
and
hearing
(inaudible)
argue
that
case
for
arizona
and
the
issue
between
arizona
and
the
solicitor
general
is
this
precise
one.
did
the
project
act,
“in
throne
the
colorado
river
compact?”
did
it
as
of
that
moment
cut-off
arizona's
right
to
further
appropriate?
did
it
require
arizona
to
come
to
the
secretary
had
in-hand
to
get
a
contract,
which
should
be
a
subject
to
the
colorado
river
compact?
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
shared
your
regret,
1954
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
but
the
point
that
we
have
all
argued
about
for
this
39
years,
the
only
reason
we
call
about
the
means
of
the
colorado
river
compact
and
the
suit
between
arizona
and
california
is
that
it
was
relevant,
it
was
relevant.
the
master
says,
“it
isn't.”
then
what
we
care
what
it
means?
why
has
arizona
been
here
four
times
on
they
joint
their
motion
in
which
you
denied
california's
motion
to
joint
these
upper
states?
a
question
was
whether
on
arizona's
three
issues
of
interpretation
of
the
colorado
river
compact,
those
absent
states
were
indispensable
parties,
interpretations
of
the
compact.
the
court
held
that
they
weren't.
and
i
supposed
the
law
of
these
cases
therefore
that
the
colorado
river
compact
can
be
construed
here
in
the
absence
of
those
states
because
in
three
issues
you
then
had
before
were
compact
issues,
nothing
else.
now,
the
subsequent
history
in
this
--
and
in
this
court
doesn't
indicate
that
the
section
18
was
found
ambiguous
or
the
283
u.s.
was
found
ambiguous.
as
a
matter
fact,
this
solicitor
of
interior
department
subsequently
interpreted
as
just
exactly
as
we
have
here
in
withdrawing
regulations
interior
department
were
issued
on
the
river.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
i
believe
so
speaking
from
memory.
arizona
alleged
in
their
complaint
that
we
were
then
using
about
4,500,000
in
1952
or
1953
and
the
last
probably
not
far
off,
we
--
mr.
attorney
general
no,
the
california
projects
that
are
before
you
now
are
the
same
ones
that
would
have
been
for
it
were
described
to
the
court
in
the
three
previous
cases,
we
have
no
new
ones.
it's
quite
true
that
the
colorado
river
aqueduct,
which
is
built-in
with
tunnels
with
full
capacity,
did
not
add
the
pumps,
all
its
pumping
equipment
until
later,
it's
come
on
by
status
and
some
in
fact
added
during
the
course
of
this
trial.
but
the
eradicable
decision
to
build
the
aqueduct
full
size
and
drive
80
miles
of
tunnels
have
made
in
1932
to
1935.
so
there's
been
no
increase
in
the
sense
of
going
into
the
river
and
building
a
new
project.
same
is
true
to
the
all-american
canal.
the
coachella
branch,
it's
true
that
more
land
has
been
added
under
the
coachella
branch
of
the
canal
in
recent
years
but
this
is
all
in
accordance
as
what
we
described
as
the
law
of
relation
of
act
of
reasonable
diligence.
the
project
diversion
capacities
are
as
it
where
initially.
it
just
gradually
flexed
them
up.
but
the
quantity
of
water
in
fact
consumed
in
california
as
they
close
the
trial
was
they
ordered
4,600,000
acre-feet.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
they're
all
initiated
in
a
sense
of
appropriations
made
and
project
--
mr.
attorney
general
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
california,
notice
his
file.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
these
were
notices
of
appropriation
under
which
work
has
been
done.
the
colorado
river
aqueduct
to
the
metropolitan
water
district
had
spent
some
$2,000,000
on
this
project
before
1929,
but
the
project
was
not
in
fact
gone
on
a
big
scale
until
1931
after
--
after
the
project
act.
the
imperial
valley
was
served
from
1901
by
a
canal
that
squirted
around
through
mexico
and
back.
the
all-american
canal
project
to
authorize
by
the
board
of
canyon
project
act
was
commenced,
authorized
in
1929,
commenced
1931
or
1932.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
arizona
is
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct,
your
honor
and
the
six
dates
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
motion
--
that
was
the
one
case
that
was
dismissed
on
motion,
the
other
was
moved
for
leave
to
file
is
not
granted.
on
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
court
to
proceed
to
the
interpretation
of
this
compact,
i
should
refer
you
as
a
special
master
did
on
the
joint
motion
to
the
hinderlider
case,
hinderlider
versus
la
plata
river
in
cherry
cheek
ditch
company
304
u.s.
92.
mr.
attorney
general
that
a
compact
--
an
interstate
compact
may
be
construed
despite
the
fact
that
all
of
the
sovereign
parties
do
it
or
not
before
the
court.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
the
language
from
a
decision
was
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
validity
in
effect
of
the
compact
because
colorado
and
new
mexico,
the
parties
to
it
are
not
parties
to
this
suit
kind
of
we
made
so,
the
contentions
unsound.
the
cases
were
many,
were
entitled
to
land
dependent
upon
the
boundary
between
states
have
been
passed
upon
by
this
court
upon
reviewed
of
judgments
of
federal
interstate
courts
and
suits
between
quite
the
litigants.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct.
mr.
attorney
general
well
--
mr.
attorney
general
well
the
--
the
master's
report
opposes
to
remind
that
a
very
dilemma,
your
honor.
if
there
is
no
shortage
now
and
no
prospect
of
any
foreseeable
shortage
until,
“vesting
projects
to
authorized,
why
are
we
here?
nobody
knows
what
those
statutes
would
say.
if
they
say
that
they're
subject
to
the
priorities
of
existing
projects,
will
not
destroy
them,
that's
one
matter.
they
say
on
the
other
hand
that
we
take
irrespective
of
the
effect
on
existing
projects
such
another.what
he
does
say
is
that
you
should
have
your
rights
now
determined
as
being
pro
rata
of
the
quantity
available.
i
reassure
you
this
can't
hurt
you
very
much
because
the
upper
basin
isn't
going
to
develop.
we
say
that's
a
wholly
unsound
premise.
if
that
premise
were
sound
and
this
case
shouldn't
be
here,
it's
not
justiciable.
we
say
the
compact
means
what
it
says.
it's
glaring
its
right
in
the
eye
and
it
enforced
as
indeed
it
will
have
to
be
enforced
if
the
upper
basin
expands
at
all,
then
we
are
subject
to
the
disaster's
consequence,
being
cut
back
to
3,800,000
acre-feet.
mr.
attorney
general
i
do
not
follow
that,
your
honor.
if
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
i
totally
--
sir,
no.
i
assure
you
most
honestly
the
reverse
is
true.
nothing
you
do
here
with
respect
to
the
decision
of
the
case
of
arizona
versus
california
to
our
mind
is
going
to
add
to
or
detract
from
the
burden
upon
the
upper
basin.
their
obligations
are
fixed
by
the
colorado
river
compact.
the
obligation
is
to
deliver
not
less
than
75,000,000
acre-feet
at
lee
ferry
every
10
years
and
to
bear
a
portion
of
the
mexican
burden
under
the
article
iii
(c).
now,
the
trouble
the
upper
basin
faces
results
from
the
fact
that
it
cannot
possibly
expand
that
all
if
the
master
is
correct
that
there
is
at
least
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
available
to
these
three
states.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
we
say
that
they
cannot
deplete
the
flow
below
the
75,000,000
and
in
addition
thereto
parts
of
the
mexican
burden
on
under
iii
(c).
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
right
but
the
point
i
am
honestly
trying
to
make
is
that
the
master
can't
be
right
that
we
both
getting
a
--
have
our
cake
in
either
two
that
you
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
that
you
cannot
assume
--
you
cannot
assume
abundance
in
the
lower
basin,
7,500,000
of
consumptive
use
plus
a
1,500,000
for
mexico,
plus
1,000,000
losses,
10,000,000
of
requirements
at
lee
ferry.
you
cannot
assume
abundance
for
the
lower
basin
and
at
the
same
time
assume
abundance
for
the
upper
basin.
one
or
the
other
is
going
to
be
short.
if
we
have
the
abundance
that
he
foresees
for
us,
no
possibility
of
shortage
in
the
foreseeable
or
the
unforeseeable
future
then
the
upper
basin
cannot
expand
one
acre-foot,
unless
you
assume
there
is
more
water
than
there's
been
for
30
years
in
the
hydrology
of
this
river
basin.
if
on
the
other
hand,
you
accept
as
a
reality
of
life,
the
flow
of
the
stream,
the
reference
of
the
last
30
years,
of
the
last
40
years
as
the
court
did
in
nebraska
versus
wyoming,
wyoming
versus
kansas
then,
then,
there
is
an
inevitable
reinforcement
of
the
colorado
river
compact
against
our
supply
and
are
being
cut
back
under
the
master's
quantity,
the
treatment
of
3,800,000.you
can't
have
it
both
ways
abundance
in
both
bases.
now,
i'm
--
mr.
attorney
general
oh
yes,
indeed.
it
would
indeed
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
right.
if
you
adapted
there
--
right
sir.
if
you
adopted
arizona's
interpretation
of
the
compact,
the
lower
basin
tributaries
were
excluded
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
from
the
accounting
as
to
iii
(a)
and
(b).
we
can
claim
from
the
upper
basin
8,500,000
acre-feet
of
lee
ferry
plus
water
from
mexico
plus
losses.
then
they
are
broken,
then
they
are
broken.
mr.
attorney
general
the
upper
compact
is
destructive
but
the
upper
basin
is
so
construed.
we
don't
assert
that
construction.
your
honor,
i
had
--
like
to
be
able
to
conclude
in
a
rather
short
time,
i
can't
do
it
this
afternoon.
i
will
--
first
thing
in
the
morning,
i
should
like
to
reserve
about
an
hour
for
rebuttal
time.
so,
i
will
now
attempt
even
now
and
as
we
start
in
the
morning
to
give
you
a
resume
of
what
we
think
is
involved
on
these
two
critical
issues
prior
--
limitation
and
prior
order.
mr.
attorney
general
the
two
critical
issues.
the
limitation
issue
that
i
have
spent
so
much
time
on
and
the
priority
issue
which
i
do
want
to
leave
very
firmly
in
your
minds
because
we
feel
that
even
if
you
should
decide
that
the
master's
right
on
the
limitation
issue
that
reference
to
the
compact
and
the
limitation
act
is
inappropriate
somehow.
nevertheless,
we
are
entitled
to
protection
for
the
priorities
of
our
existing
projects
in
california
within
that
4,400,000
acre-feet.
you
should
not
prorate
a
shortage.
it
should
be
borne
by
the
new
project.
and
if
you
follow
our
construction
of
limitation,
there's
no
shortage,
you
stop
is
a
risk.
but
the
priority
issue
i
have
want
to
--
before
i
threw
emphasize,
then
i
want
to
take
up
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
then
bear
upon
both
of
those
two
issues
give
you
something
of
the
way
of
which
these
two
issues
bear
upon
the
project
that's
hazard
here,
the
metropolitan
water
district
and
finally
to
conclude.
so
i
shall
endeavor
within
the
minute
of
so
now
left
and
about
half
hour
in
the
morning
to
cover
that
ground
and
reserve
about
an
hour
for
me.
the
case
has
been
here
not
only
in
283
u.s.
but
also
in
the
perpetuation
of
testimony
case
in
the
292
u.s.
case
of
united
states
versus
arizona
in
295
u.s.,
and
the
final
arizona
and
california
cases
in
1935
and
298
u.s.
now,
the
arizona,
the
first
of
these
cases,
i
have
already
mentioned
to
you.
if
the
special
master
is
right
in
his
interpretation
of
the
project
act,
then
it
passes
all
comprehension
that
the
arizona
senators
and
congressmen
should've
voted
against
this
act,
should've
opposed
the
appropriations
to
build
hoover
dam
that
conferred
these
benefits
upon
them.
and
in
1930,
the
state
of
arizona
sued
in
this
court
to
enjoin
the
project
act
in
the
compact
in
going
to
effect.
why?
that
is
the
question
i'll
weigh
about
the
morning.
mr.
attorney
general
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
my
desire
very
briefly
to
state
the
position
of
the
state
of
utah
in
this
case.
utah
was
impleaded
as
the
party
defendant
by
order
of
the
court
but
only
in
its
capacity
as
a
lower
basin
state.
utah's
principal
interest
in
the
colorado
is,
of
course,
as
a
member
of
the
upper
basin.
the
portion
of
the
lower
colorado
river
basin
located
within
utah
lies
in
the
extreme
southwest
corner
of
the
state.
in
its
north-south
dimension,
it
is
about
35
miles.
in
its
east-west
dimension,
it
is
about
a
hundred
miles.
mr.
attorney
general
where
the
virgin
river
comes
through.
the
principal
streams
are
the
virgin
river
system,
kanab
creek
and
johnson
creek
and
they
enter
into
the
colorado
below
lee
ferry.
of
these
three
streams,
the
only
one
which
contributes
any
appreciable
quantity
of
water
to
the
colorado
river
is
the
virgin
river.
by
its
pleadings
in
this
case,
utah
asked
for
a
decree
awarding
it
the
right
to
the
consumptive
use
of
125,000
acre-feet
of
water
per
annum
from
these
tributaries
of
the
colorado
river
flowing
through
the
utah
portion
of
the
lower
basin.
this
included
approximately
50
--
58,000
acre-feet
of
water
for
present
uses
and
approximately
$67,000
--
67,000
acre-feet
for
future
development.
the
future
development
consisted
principally
of
an
irrigation
project
known
as
the
“dixie
project”
on
the
virgin
river.
as
the
hearings
before
the
master
progressed
in
this
case,
it
became
evident
that
no
other
state
of
the
lower
basin
challenged
any
--
in
anyway
utah's
present
uses.
only
california
expressed
any
objection
to
utah's
proposed
development.
on
the
--
and
the
california
objection
in
that
respect
wasn't
made
only
as
a
part
of
its
general
contention
that
because
of
the
inadequate
water
supply
in
the
mainstream,
no
new
project
should
be
permitted.
in
this
date
of
the
record,
the
special
master
held
that
no
justiciable
controversy
was
presented
so
far
as
utah's
present
or
future
uses
were
concerned.
in
fact,
the
master's
ruling
applied
not
only
to
utah
but
he
declined
to
adjudicate
any
main
stream
rights
to
inflow
from
the
tributaries.
likewise,
he
declined
to
adjudicate
any
rights
as
between
the
tributary
states.
he
did
say,
the
special
master,
that
in
the
event
that
the
dispute
arose
that
such
dispute
should
be
settled
by
application
of
the
doctor
--
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment.
although
utah
naturally
would
have
preferred
a
decree
from
this
court
affirming
to
it
the
rights
it
claimed
as
to
present
uses
and
future
uses,
we
did
not
take
any
exceptions
to
the
special
master's
report
and
recommended
decree.
this,
for
the
very
practical
reason,
that
so
far
as
the
report
and
recommended
decree
were
concerned,
it
left
us
free
to
continue
our
present
uses
and
to
pursue
our
future
development.
presently
irrigated
acreage
in
the
utah
portion
of
the
lower
basin
is
about
25,000
acres.
the
dixie
project,
the
plans
for
which
have
already
been
implemented
by
state
action,
will
increase
this
amount
of
irrigated
acreage
by
about
13,500
feet.
if
the
court
please,
utah
is
not
directly
concerned
in
how
the
court
may
choose
to
divide
the
waters
of
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
as
between
the
states
of
the
lower
basin
located
on
the
mainstream,
particularly,
a
division
based
upon
a
construction
of
the
project
act
as
distinguished
from
the
colorado
river
compact.
it
is
our
considered
judgment
that
the
lower
basin
rights
of
utah
are
left
unimpaired
by
the
special
master's
report
and
recommend
decree.
and
we
are
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
my
understanding
of
the
report.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
attorney
general
i
--
per
--
perhaps,
they
are
--
both,
i
would
think
justice
frankfurter.
we
at
one
time,
made
a
claim
before
this
court
on
the
joinder
issue
that
it
was
de
minimis.
and
although,
the
master
didn't
couch
his
holding
in
those
terms,
he
did
say
that
we
were
in
effect
seeking
the
declaratory
judgment
and
he
didn't
think
it
was
right
for
such
a
judgment.
mr.
attorney
general
58
--
58,000
acre-feet
of
water.
mr.
attorney
general
we
are
using
58,000,
irrigating
25,000
acres
and
--
mr.
attorney
general
would
be
an
addition
of
the
dix
--
mr.
attorney
general
and
we
are
claiming
the
right
to
an
additional
68
--
67,000
acre-feet
of
water
which
would
be
a
supplemental
water
supply
for
the
present
acreage
which
is
inadequate,
actually,
as
well
would
bring
new
acreage
in
the
cultivation.
mr.
attorney
general
we
didn't
file
any
brief.
mr.
attorney
general
mr.
justice
black
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
are
in
recommendations
of
the
special
master
that
our
primary
concerns
in
new
mexico
have
not
been
discussed
by
the
other
parties
to
this
action.
as
defined
in
the
colorado
river
compact,
new
mexico
is
both
a
part
of
the
upper
basin
and
lower
basin.
where
lower
basin's
state
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
little
colorado
and
the
gila
both
originating
in
new
mexico
have
their
confluence
with
the
mainstream
below
lee's
ferry.
upon
motion
of
the
defendant,
the
state
of
california
and
the
cause
of
our
tributary
interest
in
the
lower
basin,
this
court
ordered
us
to
be
made
a
party
to
the
action
and
the
order
of
december
the
12th,
1955.
as
the
hearings
progressed,
it
became
increasingly
more
evident
that
our
interest
in
the
principal
controversy
was
more
academic
than
real.
however,
in
view
of
our
important,
though
by
comparison
de
minimis,
uses
of
water
from
the
two
aforementioned
tributaries,
new
mexico
had
a
great
expense
prepared
and
submitted
to
the
special
master,
evidence
of
these
uses
both
present
and
contemplated.
since
there
had
not
heretofore
been
an
apportionment
of
the
waters
of
the
two
streams
between
the
states
concerned,
we
precede
on
the
premises
of
--
of
equitable
apportionment
as
previously
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
nebraska
versus
wyoming,
325
u.s.
589,
to
sustain
our
burden
and
because
of
certain
rulings
of
the
special
master
as
to
evidentially
matter
to
be
received
was
necessary
to
take
the
deposition
of
something
over
200
witnesses
comprising
a
deposition
of
some
3,700
pages.
and
this
deposition
was
for
the
purpose
of
proving
or
providing
direct
evidence
of
present
uses
of
water
for
irrigation
in
new
mexico,
largely
from
the
utah
river.
the
special
master
found
that
there
was
no
present
controversy
as
to
the
waters
of
the
little
colorado
and
thus
no
--
thus
no
apportionment
of
those
waters
was
necessary
at
this
time.
however,
as
to
the
gila
river
and
the
tributaries,
we
found
it
is
presently
over
appropriated
and
therefore,
apportionment
was
necessary
to
this
end
and
in
keeping
with
the
principles
of
equitable
apportionment.
it
awarded
new
mexico
the
uses
that
he
found
present.
now,
you
mentioned
that
our
uses
are
de
minimis,
however,
i
would
be
remised
with
my
duties
to
the
people
of
my
state
if
i
did
not
emphasize
to
this
court
the
extreme
necessity
of
this
water
to
maintain
even
the
present
low-level
economy
of
the
southwestern
potion
of
our
state
which
is
based
primarily
on
ranching
and
mining.
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
as
the
uses
--
mr.
attorney
general
it's
between
new
mexico
and
arizona
primarily,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
of
the
simple
reason
that
the
problem
was
found
to
exist
once
we
were
brought
into
the
case
that
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
water
for
over
appropriated.
mr.
attorney
general
and
new
mexico.
mr.
attorney
general
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
what
they
perhaps
would
always
or
rather.
mr.
attorney
general
first,
we
are
in
here
involuntarily,
your
honor.
we'd
be
doing
very
--
the
best
--
very
best
we
could
under
the
circumstances
that
evidence
loss
induced
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
now
at
this
point,
no
sir.
we
--
we
think
we
had
gained
a
few
things
worth
retaining.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
no
one
here.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir.
we
have
in
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
we
hope
too,
your
honor.
we
--
the
--
the
potential
future
development
down
there
is
also
great,
the
gila
wilderness
being
the
greatest
undeveloped
recreational
area
in
the
united
states
at
this
time.
my
co-counsel
has
some
further
remarks.
mr.
attorney
general
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
new
mexico,
i
would
merely
like
to
mention
a
few
factors
in
--
as
to
how
the
report
of
the
master
was
arrived
at.
the
new
mexico
had,
after
it
had
been
brought
into
this
case
involuntarily,
did
request
equitable
apportionment
as
to
its
uses
on
the
gila
river
and
its
tributaries
in
new
mexico.
the
master
in
his
report
did
make
his
decision
with
reference
to
the
uses
on
the
gila
river
between
new
mexico,
arizona
and
the
united
states
on
the
theory
of
equitable
apportionment
and
with
which
willingly
we're
very
much
pleased.
however,
it
is
true
that
we
felt
in
the
draft
report
that
there
had
been
considerable
limitation
of
the
actual
uses
in
the
gila
on
the
new
mexico
side
of
the
line
and
that
we
were
unhappy
with
that
result
and
filed
our
comments
to
the
master's
report
with
him
on
that
matter.
subsequently,
representatives
of
arizona
and
new
mexico
entered
into
negotiations
to
attempt
to
compromise
as
to
the
actual
uses
on
the
gila
and
its
tributaries
within
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
after
considerable
negotiations
that
compromised
was
affected
and
a
stipulation
was
filed
with
the
special
master.
the
special
master
adopted
in
full
the
findings
of
facts,
conclusions
of
law
and
even
provisions
of
the
decree
dealing
with
these
uses
in
accordance
with
the
stipulation
between
the
parties.
as
a
result,
the
--
although
new
mexico
did
improve
its
situation,
we
were
not
completely
happy
as
--
as
true
in
most
cases
in
negotiating
a
compromise
but
we
did
improve
our
situation
and
we
are
here
to
request
this
court,
at
this
time,
to
adopt
in
full
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
the
provisions
of
the
decree
insofar
as
applies
to
new
mexico
and
its
uses.
at
this
time,
however,
there
is
one
slight
error
in
the
decree
which
is
really
an
omission
and
it's
obvious,
which
i
think
that
i
should
call
to
the
court's
attention
and
which
should
be
corrected.
on
page
340
of
the
master's
report
--
341,
about
the
middle
of
the
page
under
the
heading
of
owner,
appears
the
name
chris
dotz,
d-o-t-z.
mr.
attorney
general
under
the
heading
of
owner
on
the
left
hand
column
of
page
341
about
halfway
down
the
figures.
mr.
attorney
general
chris
dotz.
and
under
that,
you
will
note
that
there
are
two
separate
and
distinct
lines
involving
legal
descriptions
of
land.
now,
in
drawing
the
decree,
on
page
356,
which
--
an
examination
of
disclosed
copies,
verbatim,
the
ownership,
subdivisions
and
descriptions
in
the
finding,
to
which
i
had
called
your
attention,
at
the
bottom
of
page
356,
is
the
name,
again,
chris
dotz
but
it
will
be
noted
that
the
second
line
of
the
description,
as
shown
in
the
finding
of
fact
on
page
341,
has
been
omitted
and
we
merely
request
that
the
decree
include
this
description
the
same
as
it
is
shown
in
the
finding
of
fact
on
page
341.
now,
as
to
one
other
matter,
i
would
like
to
request
at
this
time
of
the
court
and
that
is
that
specifically,
the
provisions
of
article
9
of
the
proposed
decree
be
incorporated
in
the
final
decree
of
this
court.
we
appeal
it
is
every
important
to
new
mexico
as
well
as
to
the
other
parties
to
this
case
that
the
future
--
the
court
retained
its
jurisdiction
and
if
future
circumstances
should
warrant
new
mexico,
for
example,
to
come
in
and
ask
for
additional
relief
that
it
be
permitted
to
do
so
and
we
think
that
is
of
extreme
importance
and
we
respectfully
request
this
court
that
that
article
be
retained
in
full.
thank
you.
mr.
attorney
general
article
ix.
i
call
it
your
attention
to
(inaudible)
mr.
attorney
general
60
yes.
so
--
mr.
attorney
general
no,
no.
if
the
court
please,
we
--
we
request
that
it
be
retained
as
it
is
written
in
the
final
decree.
mr.
attorney
general
i
hope
not.
mr.
attorney
general
certainly,
sir,
thank
you.
mr.
attorney
general
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
endeavor
during
the
course
of
the
remaining
times
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
here.
but
in
the
preliminary
way,
your
honor,
i
should
like
to
place
this
in
the
perspective.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
observed
that
yesterday
in
a
question
or
a
comment
relate,
california
does
have
two
strings
to
its
bow.
one
is
a
so-called
“limitation
issue”,
that
is
our
contention
that
the
claims
marshaled
against
us
on
the
main
river
should
not
be
3,100,000
acre-feet
but
should
be
only
of
the
order
1,100,000
because
2,000,000
of
the
3,100,000
from
which
we
are
excluded
are
accounted
for
by
the
advantages,
the
beneficial
use
which
our
neighbors
make
on
the
tributaries.
the
second
string
of
our
bow
is
that
if
there
is
less
than
7,500,000
acre-feet
available
for
consumptive
use
in
lake
mead
and
below
then
the
burden
of
shortages
should
be
adjusted
by
application
of
the
rules
of
equitable
apportionment
and
should
not
fall
pro
rata
upon
this
contract
users
irrespective
of
any
of
the
elements
of
equitable
apportionment,
namely,
priority
of
their
inception
of
their
use
nor
the
magnitude
of
their
existing
users.
i
shall
deal
first
today
with
that
second
problem,
namely,
assuming,
for
the
moment,
that
there
is
a
shortage
that
is
that
the
secretary
of
interior
cannot
deliver
from
lake
mead
and
below
as
much
as
7,500,000
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use
in
any
year,
how
shall
that
shortage
be
borne?
with
respect
to
that
string
of
our
--
on
our
bow,
we
have
two
errors.
one
is
that
the
statute
did
not
either
set
up
a
--
an
apportionment,
an
allocation
among
these
states
nor
authorize
the
secretary
of
interior
to
do
so
but
if
he
did
do
so
then
he
did
not
impose
a
federal
apportionment
a
proration
scheme
upon
us
but
he
preserve
the
doctrine
of
priority.
i
shall
take
up
first
the
question
of
what
the
statute
did.
if
any
authority
is
to
be
found
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
anywhere
for
the
imposition
of
a
federal
apportionment
absent
a
--
i
presume,
an
interstate
compact,
that
authority
must
be
found
in
section
5,
no
other
source
is
suggested
by
anyone.
this
is
a
section
which
directs
that
the
secretary
of
interior
is
authorized
a
contract
with
the
storage
and
delivery
of
water
and
second
that
no
person
shall
have
the
right
to
use
of
the
water
stored
as
aforesaid
without
a
contract.
did
or
did
not,
that
language
delegate
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
authority
to
“impose
a
federal
apportionment”
those
are
the
master's
words.
upon
these
three
states
absent
the
consent
of
their
legislatures
to
a
tri-state
compact.
now,
as
a
preliminary
matter,
this
master
is
quite
firm
--
quite
firm
in
rejecting
arizona's
contention
that
the
section
5
language,
which
says
that
such
contract
shall
confirm
to
section
4
(a),
means
that
the
secretary
was
given
a
mandatory
formula
by
section
4
(a)
which
he
should
impose
by
his
contracts.
the
master
is
unequivocal
upon
that
point.
he
says
that
the
authority
in
section
4
(a)
to
these
states
to
enter
into
a
compact
is
permissive
only.
it
was
never
entered
into
and
has
no
operative
effect
whatsoever.
it
did
not
control
the
secretary.
that
means
so
if
the
secretary
did
impose
a
contractual
allocation
scheme
upon
us,
it
was
by
the
exercise
of
his
own
discretion
at
some
later
time
and
the
master
says
that
he
voluntarily
looked
to
the
apportionment
which
might
have
been
made
by
an
interstate
compact
had
one
been
made
in
the
pattern
of
section
4
(a)
and
more
or
less
adopted
that
scheme
and,
hence,
imposed
it
upon
us
against
our
will
a
compact
which
our
legislature
had
rejected.
we
find
that
to
be
an
extra
ordinary
piece
of
statutory
construction.
we
looked
to
the
language
of
the
statute
and
we
look
to
the
temper,
the
time,
the
spirit,
the
language
of
the
debates.
this
was
a
congress
which
was
acutely
sensitive
to
the
necessity
of
proceeding
by
a
consent
of
the
states
and
not
by
a
mandate
of
congress
attempting
--
attempting
to
divide
water.
that
is
inherit
in
almost
every
section
of
this
act.
have
this
been
the
simple
problem
above
congress
laying
its
mighty
hand
upon
the
river
and
dividing
up
the
water.
there
was
no
occasion
whatever
for
the
colorado
river
compact
in
the
first
place,
the
cumbersome
device
of
first,
an
authorization
by
congress
in
1921
to
the
states
to
negotiate.
they
send
in
of
a
federal
commission
to
preside
and
then
bringing
back
that
compact
for
a
consent
of
congress.
second,
there
was
no
necessity
had
they
to
offer
to
the
legislature
of
california
a
limitation
agreement
to
be
made
effective
by
the
legislature
of
that
state.
all
congress
had
to
do
was
to
make
the
division
on
the
phase
of
the
statute
and
that's
all
it
was
to
it.
why
go
through
to
this
cumbersome
device
of
the
--
of
the
consensual
arrangement?
and
third
had
congress
indented
to
divide
up
the
waters
among
arizona,
california
and
nevada,
why
not
say
so
and
do
it?
why
again
go
through
the
cumbersome
device
of
inviting
these
three
states
to
agree
in
either
in
the
pattern
here
offered
or
in
some
other
pattern
in
the
latter
event
bring
it
back
for
the
approval
of
congress?
why
throughout
these
acts
set
up
the
--
the
enthronement,
as
the
senate
committee
called
it,
of
a
compact
clause
of
the
constitution,
use
that
device
to
bring
about
agreement
rather
than
impose
it
by
a
federal
mandate,
for
the
very
good
reason,
for
the
very
good
reason
that
all
of
the
senators
who
address
themselves
to
this
subject
denied
the
existence
of
the
constitutional
power
in
congress
to
affect
any
such
division
of
the
waters.
they
control
the
sovereignty,
the
jurisdiction
and
the,
let
us
say,
ownership
of
the
waters
vested
in
the
states
and
not
in
the
federal
government.
whether
they
were
right
or
whether
they
were
wrong
in
their
constitutional
analysis
is
beside
the
point.
there
was
a
complete
absence
of
intent
by
congress
to
make
any
such
division.
and
of
course,
a
fortiori,
a
complete
absence
of
any
attention
to
delegate
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
an
authority
which
the
congress
itself
denied
that
it
possessed.
let
me
read
to
you
a
few
examples
of
what
the
senator
said.
but
first
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
compilation
of
--
on
this
subject
of
the
legislative
history.
you
have
it
before
you.
it
is
captioned,
legislative
history
appendixes
accompanying
the
reply
brief
of
the
california
defendants
to
the
answering
briefs
of
the
united
states,
arizona,
nevada
is
dated
october
2,
1961.
this
contains
a
collection
of
the
--
what
was
said
by
the
proponents
and
the
opponents
of
the
--
of
the
bill
upon
five
related
topics.
appendix
a,
beginning
at
page
7,
is
a
collection
of
extraction,
the
debates
evidence
in
congress
view
the
congress
had
no
power
to
allocate
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system.
appendix
b,
beginning
at
page
31,
is
a
collection
of
the
extracts
from
the
debates
showing
that
both
the
proponents
and
the
supporters
of
the
swing-johnson
bills
clearly
and
consistently
denied
that
the
bills
purported
to
make
or
to
authorize
any
federal
allocation
of
water
among
the
states.
in
appendix
c,
beginning
at
page
79,
says
the
legislative
history
items
selected
by
arizona
do
not
relate
to
any
federal
allocation
within
the
lower
basin
but
rather
to
substantial
effectuation
of
the
colorado
river
compacts
apportionment
to
the
upper
basin
without
arizona's
ratification.
appendix
d,
beginning
at
page
103,
makes
the
point
that
the
legislative
history
refused
arizona's
contention
that
the
proponents
and
opponents
of
the
swing-johnson
bills
believe
the
project
act
would
abrogate
interstate
priority
principles
within
the
lower
basin.
and
appendix
e,
beginning
at
page
134,
makes
the
point
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
section
5
requirement
that
water
delivery
contracts
executed
pursuant
thereto
shall
conform
to
section
4
(a)
refutes
arizona's
argument
that
congress,
unilaterally,
imposed
a
federal
allocation
of
colorado
river
waters
upon
arizona,
california
and
nevada.
the
specific
items
that
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
are
these.
let
me
start
with
a
senator
who
was
disinterested
not
for
any
of
these
states,
senator
borah.
this
--
the
extract
i
am
about
to
refer
to
is
in
page
75
of
the
legislative
history
compilation.
and
the
particular
statement
appears
at
70
congressional
record
391-92.
he
says,
"i
can
see
how
arizona
might
loose
her
rights
not
by
reason
of
this
legislation
but
by
reason
of
acts
of
appropriation
and
going
on,
and
going
in
carrying
out
the
terms
this
bill
in
case
arizona
did
not
assert
her
rights
in
the
court.
if
she
stood
by
and
water
were
appropriated
to
beneficial
use
in
other
states,
she
might
loose
her
rights.
she
would
not
loose
it,
however,
by
reason
of
this
legislation
but
by
reason
of
the
acts
of
appropriation.”
and
he
goes
on
to
say
“undoubtedly,”
referring
to
page
92,
“undoubtedly,
if
arizona
stands
idly
by
and
does
not
protect
her
rights
either
by
appropriation
or
by
such
action
in
the
courts
as
will
protect
them,
she
will
loose
her
rights
ultimately.
that
is
one
of
the
penalties
of
living
under
the
doctrine
of
prior
appropriation.
if
an
individual
has
a
farm
or
a
ranch
and
the
water
is
running
by
it,
he
does
not
use
his
neighbor
below
him
or
above
him
can
appropriated
and
taken
away
from
him
ultimately.”
so,
here,
i
presume,
if
arizona
should
not
act,
she
perhaps
would
be
prejudiced
by
this
legislation
in
the
sense
of
the
acts
carrying
out
would
result
in
appropriation
by
others.
it
would
not
be
act
to
congress
which
took
away
her
rights
however
but
the
acts
of
appropriation
following
as
a
result
of
it.
senator
pittman,
congressman
white,
congressman
bankhead
others
all
made
statements
to
the
same
effect.
senator
bratton
said
--
he
--
his
expressions
are
the
same
effect,
i
shall
not
take
your
time
to
review
it.
all
of
this,
your
honors,
points
up
the
points
of
appearance.
it
seems
to
us
that
section
5
when
it
use
the
expression
“that
no
person
should
have
a
right
to
the
use
of
waters
stored
aforesaid
without
a
contract”
was
talking
about
the
incremental
supply
not
therefore
appropriated.
the
court
may
recall
that
in
the
last
time
the
court
wrote
an
opinion
on
the
colorado
river
case
in
the
298
u.s.
558,
the
court
denied
to
file
on
the
ground
of
united
states
was
unnecessary
party
to
arizona's
suit
brought
against
the
states
of
the
colorado
river
basin
for
what
it
has
been
called
a
judicial
apportionment
of
the
unappropriated
waters.
now,
there,
the
court
to
mr.
justice
stone
said
this,
i
--
what
--
the
point
and
want
to
emphasize
is
that
the
court
construed
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
as
dealing
in
its
authority
delegated
to
the
secretary
where
the
unappropriated
waters.
the
unappropriate
waters,
what
is
the
fond
of
water?
the
water
stored
as
aforesaid
to
which
the
contractual
power
shall
relate,
and
the
court
said
this,
at
page
565,
“it
is
conceited
both
by
the
bill
of
complaints
and
the
returns
that
all
the
states
in
the
colorado
river
basin
except
california
and
california
so
far
as
material
to
the
present
case
apply
the
doctrine
of
appropriation
to
the
waters
of
flowing
streams
in
their
respective
territories.”
under
this
doctrine,
diversion
and
application
of
water
to
a
beneficial
use
constitute
an
appropriation
and
entitle
the
appropriator
to
a
continuing
right
to
use
the
water
to
the
extent
of
the
appropriation
but
not
beyond
that
reasonably
required
and
actually
used.
the
appropriator
first
in
time
is
prior
and
right
over
others
upon
the
same
--
same
stream
and
the
right,
when
perfected
by
use,
is
deemed
effective
from
the
time
that
purpose
to
make
the
appropriation
is
definitely
formed
and
actual
work
upon
the
project
has
began
or
from
the
times
statutory
requirements
of
notice
of
the
proposed
appropriation
or
complied
with
provided
the
work
is
carried
to
completion
and
the
water
supplied
to
have
beneficial
use
with
reasonable
diligence.
at
page

this
court
said,
“a
judiciable
controversy
is
presented
only
if
arizona,
as
a
sovereign
state,
order
citizens,
whom
she
represents,
have
present
rights
in
the
unappropriated
water
of
the
river
or
if
the
privilege
to
appropriate
the
water
is
capable
in
division
and
when
partitioned
maybe
judicially
protected
from
appropriation
by
others
pending
it
--
its
exercise.”
now,
the
question
is
when
congress
delegated
to
the
secretary
the
authority
to
make
contracts
and
directed
that
no
one
should
have
the
right
to
use
the
water
stored
as
aforesaid
saved
by
a
contract,
did
it
mean
as
the
master
oblige
that
it
cut
off,
took
over
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
waters
not
there
before
in
fact
put
to
use
by
1929
and
cut
off
all
appropriative
rights
to
the
extent
they
had
not
been
in
fact
put
to
use
by
the
use
of
water,
took
that
appropriation
away
and
that
the
secretary
may
now
contract
out
that
appropriated
but
it's
--
as
yet
unused
water
to
others
or
did
the
court
--
did
the
congress
says
we
believe,
especially
in
the
light
i
have
just
read
from
298
u.s.,
mean
that
it
was
not
cutting
off
appropriative
rights
but
was
dealing
with
the
unappropriated
water.
the
distinction
is
this,
the
master
construes
a
present
perfected
right
as
being
a
right
measured
by
the
quantity
of
water
in
fact
put
to
use
by
june
25,
1929.
there
were,
as
of
june
25,
1929
as
everywhere
on
every
western
stream,
appropriative
rights
perfectly
valid,
vested,
existing
property
rights
to
the
--
to
quantities
in
excess
of
those
in
fact
used
as
of
that
date.
let
me
illustrate.
when
you
build
a
great
project,
it
may
take
years
to
put
all
the
water
to
use.
a
municipality
that
doesn't
build
ahead
25
years
ahead
of
its
requirements
is
delinquent
in
its
duty.
a
federal
reclamation
project
automatically
under
the
reclamation
law
allows
a
ten
year
period
of
development
in
which
the
farmers
pay
nothing
toward
repayment
of
the
cost
of
the
project
because
everyone
recognizes
it
takes
time
to
get
farm
started.
you
can't
begin
to
grow
crops
and
pay
up.
the
history
of
the
west
is
if
the
water
used
gradually
increases
on
every
project.
you
don't
put
it
to
use
the
day
after
you
complete
your
--
your
dam
and
your
canals.
that
is
a
very
reason
for
the
requirement
of
diligence.
it
is
a
reason
for
the
law
of
relation
back.
did
or
did
not
congress,
in
section
5,
intend,
without
saying
so,
to
abrogate
a
doctrine
of
relation
back
and
to
recognize
and
protect
then
the
valid
appropriative
rights
only
to
the
extent
that
the
water
had
been
applied
to
use.
that
would
be
a
remarkable
conclusion
to
read
into
this
statute
written
by
western
senators
acutely
conscious
of
the
--
of
the
fact
that
water
rights
depended
in
all
of
their
states
on
the
law
of
appropriation
and
it
--
either
on
state
law.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
the
word
“present”
is
derived
in
--
in
the
statute
from
the
use
of
the
word
“present”
in
article
viii
of
the
colorado
river
compact
which
provides
that
this
present
perfected
rights
are
unimpaired
by
this
compact
and
in
the
second
section
provides
that
when
a
storage
has
been
provided
on
the
main
river
to
the
extent
of
5,000,000
acre-feet,
those
present
perfected
rights
shall
attach
to
that
stored
water
in
effect
releasing
up
stream
flow
for
use
by
junior
appropriators
in
the
upper
basin.
so
far
as
the
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
is
concerned
in
section
6
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act,
all
that
section
6
did,
written
by
upper
basin
representatives,
mr.
carpenter
of
colorado,
as
he
explained
was
to
designate
that
this
reservoir,
boulder
dam
--
hoover
dam
is
the
reservoir
referred
to
in
article
viii.
that
when
this
reservoir
has
built,
a
present
perfected
rights
in
the
lower
basin
attached
to
that
reservoir
and
or
not
to
remain
operative
against
the
upper
basin
pending
the
completion
of
a
dam
say
glen
canyon
in
the
upper
basin.
why
they
use
the
word
“present
perfected
rights”
is
not
apparent.
it
is
not
apparent.
it
has
--
as
used
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act,
surely,
not
the
--
the
implication
that
we
are
restricting
the
recognition
of
appropriative
rights
to
the
quantities
in
fact
used
as
of
june
25,
1929.
there
are
two
reasons.
one,
the
master
gives
is
why
that
can't
be
so.
he
treats
as
a
present
perfected
right
as
of
june
25,
1929,
the
full
requirements
of
indian
reservations
created
prior
to
that
date
even
though
they
hadn't
use
or
drop
the
water.
to
him,
present
perfected
right
as
to
a
federally
created
reservation
doesn't
mean
the
water
put
to
use
as
of
june
25,
1929,
it's
the
ultimate
requirement
of
the
irrigable
acreage
of
the
reservation
even
though
he
may
not
discover
that
until
a
land
of
--
utilization
surveys
made
20
years
later.
second,
a
more
controlling
from
our
view
point,
is
the
fact
that
this
act
offered
to
california
a
limitation
applicable
to
her
rights
which
may
now
exist,
rights
which
may
now
exist.
article
iii
of
the
compact
provides
that
the
7,500,000
acre-feet
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
shall
include
the
water
necessary
to
supply
“rights
which
may
now
exist”.
that
is
a
different
definition
and
a
greater
right
than
a
more
restricted
“present
perfected
right”.
did
congress,
did
congress
in
offering
to
california
a
--
an
agreement
which
would
limit
the
quantity
of
water
available
for
our
“rights
which
may
now
exist”
intend
without
saying
so
to
redefine
and
limit
that
expression
down
to
the
quantity
in
fact
used
in
1929.
in
short,
when
we
get
onto
the
discussion
of
what
is
a
present
perfected
right,
we
are
on
a
subdivision
of
the
true
problem
which
is
what
is
a
right
which
may
now
exist
as
of
1929,
a
right
which
may
now
exist.
if
i
may
have
your
attention
to
section
4
(a)
at
page
--
on
top
of
page
382,
start
at
the
bottom
of
page
381,
if
you
please
which
is
a
direction
of
the
act
shall
not
take
effect
until
conditions
are
met.
but
this
is
a
pro
--
language
of
the
prohibition.
this
act
shall
not
take
effect,
no
authority
be
exercise
so
forth
and
so
on
then
as
return
the
page
and
no
water
rights
shall
be
claimed
or
initiated
here
under
and
no
steps
shall
be
taken
by
the
united
states
or
by
others
to
initiate
or
perfect
any
claims
to
the
use
of
water
pertinent
to
such
structures
unless
meant
held.
these
conditions
as
to
the
enactment
--
limitation
are
met
and
ratification
of
the
compact.
but
two
thirds
the
way
down
the
page
appears
the
language
of
the
limitation
which
california
is
to
enact.
the
quantity
stated
is
to
include
all
uses
under
contracts
made
under
the
provisions
of
this
act
and
all
water
necessary
for
the
supply
of
any
rights
which
may
now
exist,
any
rights
which
may
now
exist.
consequently,
we
say,
your
honors,
that
our
rights
which
may
now
exist
as
of
june
25,
1929
were
preserved,
not
cut
off
as
of
the
magnitude
of
the
quantity
of
water
there
before
put
to
use
and
that
those
rights
are
entitled
to
retain
their
interstate
priorities
as
against
arizona.
we
think
that
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
first
of
the
colorado
river
cases,
283
u.s.,
is
precisely
to
that
point
because
there,
the
courts
speaking
through
mr.
justice
brandeis
relied
upon
section
18
of
the
act
to
accomplish
precisely
that
result
in
reassuring
arizona
that
her
appropriative
rights
were
not
cut
off
by
the
statute
as
against
us.
section
18,
appears
395
of
the
report,
and
this
provides
that
nothing
herein
shall
be
construed
as
interfering
with
such
rights
as
the
states
now
have
either
to
the
waters
within
their
borders
or
to
adopt
such
policies
and
enact
such
laws
as
they
may
deem
necessary
with
respect
to
the
appropriation
control
and
use
of
waters
within
their
borders
except
as
modified
by
the
colorado
river
compact
or
other
interstate
agreement
of
the
united
states
gives
out
or
arizona
that
gives
that
language
inter-basin
affect
only
as
to
practically
upper
basin.
the
master
gives
it
intrastate
effect.
he
relies
upon
it
to
preserve
the
priorities
intrastate
within
arizona,
let
us
say,
as
between
contract
holders
and
appropriators
under
state
law.
we
say
that
mr.
justice
brandeis
speaking
for
this
court
gave
an
interstate
effect
because
the
claim
of
the
state
of
arizona
was
that
the
project
act
had
in
effect
cut
off
its
right
of
control
of
appropriation
and
for
that
reason
was
unconstitutional
for
variety
of
reasons.
the
court
rejected
that
claim
relying
upon
section
18.
now,
the
--
to
pursue
this
line
of
thought
for
a
moment,
the
distinction
between
what
the
definition
of
what
our
water
stored
as
aforesaid
which
the
contracts
of
a
right
shall
relate.
this
question
came
up
early
for
administrative
determination.
and
in
1930,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
advised
the
palo
verde
irrigation
district
which
was
then
had
a
problem
before
of
whether
should
or
should
not
apply
for
a
contract.
it
had
used
since
1877
the
natural
flow
of
that.
and
on
july
31,
1930,
the
secretary
of
interior
wrote
to
the
palo
verde
irrigation
district.
this
is
california
exhibit
351
and
he
construed
section
5
of
the
project
act
as
relating
only
to
the
incremental
stored
water.
he
said,
“if
no
stored
water
is
required
by
the
palo
verde
irrigation
district,
no
contract
between
that
district
and
the
united
states
will
be
required.”
those
possess
their
priority
rights
to
the
unregulated
flow
of
the
river
will
be
privileged
to
continue
the
enjoinment
of
those
rights
without
an
interference
by
storage
in
the
boulder
canyon
reservoir.
as
a
result,
the
palo
verde
contract
and
all
of
the
contracts
subsequently
made
in
california
provide
for
the
delivery
of
so
much
water
from
storage
as
together
with
all
other
waters
diverted,
all
of
the
waters
diverted,
equally
stated
quantity.
we
think
that
when
the
master
disowns
and
rejects
the
contention
that
section
4
(a)
imposed
a
mandatory
proration
formula,
he
thereby
holds
under
opinion
out
the
many
contention
that
the
congress
made
any
division
of
the
water.
and
we
do
not
find
in
section
5
any
delegation
of
authority
to
the
secretary
of
interior
to
do
that.
what
section
5
does
say
is
that
the
secretary
shall
make
contracts
for
the
storage
and
delivery
of
water
and
those
contracts
shall
be
for
permanent
service.
why?
the
master
twice
explains
the
phrase
“permanent
service”.
it
is
required,
he
says,
in
order
to
give
a
project
a
reasonably
stable
and
reliable
source
of
water,
legally
and
--
and
physically
available.
that
is
precisely
the
policy,
the
purpose
of
the
law
of
priority
of
appropriation.
so
that
he
who
has
by
his
efforts
to
put
water
to
use
shall
not
be
deprived
of
it
at
a
later
time
by
some
administrative
proration.
the
secretary
did
in
fact
enter
into
a
contracts
before
california
agencies.
there
are
not
many
contracts
involved
here
to
control
these
problems.
there
are
contracts
in
existence
with
four
california
agencies,
two
with
the
state
of
nevada,
one
with
the
state
of
arizona.
we
do
not
find
in
section
5
any
authority
to
the
secretary
to
make
any
interstate
allocation.
these
are
to
be,
in
our
mind,
contracts
with
such
as
those
that
had
been
made
for
years
under
the
reclamation
law.
section
8
of
the
1902
reclamation
act
provides
that
beneficial
use
shall
be
the
basis
of
the
measure
and
the
limit
of
the
right.
united
states
doesn't
issue
patents
or
grants
to
water
rights.
the
states
don't.
the
united
states
beginning
in
1902
has
followed
the
pattern
established
by
the
state
law,
which
is
that
possession,
beneficial
use
measures
the
right.
the
state
doesn't
issue
you
a
grant
or
patent
to
water
rights
anymore
than
does
to
wild
flower
or
fish
in
the
rivers.
it
gives
you
a
license
to
appropriate
them,
to
take
possession
of
them.
the
right
is
possessory
in
character.
you
establish
it
by
self-help.
it
is
measured
by
what
you
do
for
yourself.
there
is
no
such
thing
in
the
doctrine
of
any
states
water
law
or
until
this
moment,
until
this
moment
in
the
laws
of
united
states
which
delegate
to
any
administrative
officer
the
power
to
set
aside
to
reserve
or
as
this
court
said
in
298
u.s.
to
somehow
apportion,
judicially
apportion
irrespective
of
use
to
set
aside.
that
isn't
the
way
of
life
for
the
west.
water
is
not
locked
up
in
that
way.
it
is
made
available
for
use
to
the
extent
its
use,
the
right
is
acquired.
now,
the
congress
intend
to
generate
some
new
kind,
some
new
kind
of
a
water
right
never
there
before
heard
of
in
the
western
water
law,
of
course
not.
it
was
dealing
against
the
--
the
background,
the
pattern,
the
whole
tapestry
of
the
water
law
of
the
west
and
it
took
care
not
to
tinker
with
it,
not
to
tinker
with
it.
if
congress,
if
these
senators
disclaim
that
the
united
states
the
power
to
divide
up
the
water,
if
they
insisted
that
the
legislatures
of
the
states
do
--
do
so,
it
is
inconceivable
that
they've
delegated
this
great
power
to
any
secretary
of
interior.
now,
i
turn
to
the
second
phase
of
this
problem.
if
the
congress
didn't
divide
the
water
and
didn't
delegate
to
the
secretary
the
power
to
divide
it,
the
search
ceases.
no
such
creature
as
a
contractual
allocation
scheme
imposing
a
federal
apportionment
likely
now
a
priority
exist.
but
if
did
delegate
any
such
power
to
the
secretary,
where
is
the
piece
of
paper
that
made
the
apportionment?
and
if
we
can
find
that
piece
of
paper,
does
it
throw
out
the
window
the
law
of
priority
or
does
it
preserve
it?
let's
embark
briefly
upon
that
search.
yesterday
afternoon,
the
question
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
black
and
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
about
the
power
--
disposition
of
electric
power
to
hoover
dam.
now,
that
opens
up
a
very
interesting
comparison.
section
5
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
in
the
one
section
provides
for
the
disposition
of
power
and
the
disposition
of
water.
with
respect
to
power,
with
respect
to
power,
it
provides
for
contracts
with
states.
with
respect
to
water,
it
does
not,
it
does
not.
with
respect
to
power,
the
--
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
indicated,
there
weren't
any
preexisting
rights
to
power,
there
were
as
to
water.
there
wasn't
any
preexisting
pattern
as
to
how
you
allocate
power.
this
was
a
new
resource
being
freshly
created.
there
wasn't
existing
pattern
of
water
law.
what
did
the
secretary
of
the
interior
do
under
the
authority
of
section
5?
first,
let's
glance
at
the
statute
itself.
it
appears
that
at
the
bottom
of
page
384
of
the
--
of
the
report.
“the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
hereby
authorized,
under
such
general
regulations
as
he
may
prescribe,
to
contract
for
the
storage
of
water
in
said
reservoir
and
for
the
delivery
thereof
at
such
points
on
the
river
and
on
said
canal
as
may
be
agreed
upon
for
irrigation
and
domestic
uses.”
i'll
stop
there
in
a
minute.
that
looks
and
sounds
like
a
delivery
to
a
water
user
and
not
to
a
state.
next,
“and
generation
of
electrical
energy
and
delivery
at
the
switchboard
to
states,
municipal
corporations,
political
subdivisions
and
so
on
upon
charges
that
will
provide
revenue
adequate”,
and
so
on.
then
it
goes
on
with
the
language
in
which
it
will
become
familiar
here,
“contracts
respecting
water
for
irrigation
and
domestic
uses
shall
be
for
permanent
service
and
shall
conform
to
paragraph
(a)
of
section
4”,
and
so
on.
now,
did
any
in
secretary
of
interior
construe
this
language
as
authorizing
him
to
make
an
interstate
apportionment
of
water?
did
he
construe
this
language
as
authorizing
him
to
make
an
interstate
apportionment
of
power?
the
answers
are
diametrically
opposite.
here
is
what
in
fact
happened.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
1930
did
sign
general
regulations
for
the
--
governing
the
allocation
of
power
to
be
generated
at
boulder
dam
not
hoover
dam.
these
appear
in
special
master's
exhibit
number
4,
the
hoover
dam
documents
at
page
a237.
here
you
find
the
piece
of
paper
we're
looking
for
with
respect
to
power.
it
is
a
general
regulation
signed
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
which
does
make
allocations
to
the
state
of
nevada,
to
the
state
of
arizona,
to
main
power
users
in
--
in
california
in
percentages,
in
percentages
of
the
power
to
be
generated.
it
is
unquestionably
an
--
mr.
attorney
general
no,
there
is
no
correlation
at
all,
your
honor.
the
california
power
users
were
required
to
obligate
themselves
to
take
and
pay
for
or
to
pay
for
if
not
taken
the
entire
firm
power
production
at
hoover
dam
subject
to
the
right
of
the
secretary
to
draw
back
36%
of
that
power
for
subsequent
contract
with
arizona
and
nevada
if
they
should
want
it.
they
did
take
it
at
a
later
time.
the
metropolitan
water
district
at
southern
california
was
looked
to
by
the
secretary
as
a
major
contractor
for
this
power,
36%.
that
power
is,
however,
earmarked
and
restricted
to
be
used
solely
for
pumping
water
into
an
(inaudible)
to
put
it
in
a
--
mr.
attorney
general
no,
the
metropolitan
had
another
contract
that
did
require
to
pay
for
water
stored
and
taken.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
well
--
yes,
sir,
the
metropolitan's
contract
does.
all
of
them
require
payment
for
--
in
two
components.
these
are
the
power
contracts
you're
asking
about?
mr.
attorney
general
this
is
for
irrigation
or
domestic
use
or
for
power?
mr.
attorney
general
irrigation
and
domestic
use.
mr.
attorney
general
for
both.
mr.
attorney
general
the
irrigation
and
domestic
use
a
statute.
in
section
1,
provides
that
no
charge
shall
be
made
for
the
storage
and
delivery
of
water
in
the
imperial
and
coachella
valleys
for
the
announced
reason
of
the
senate
committee
that,
“they
already
had
a
water
right.”
mr.
attorney
general
with
respect
to
the
metropolitan
water
district,
it
was
required
by
its
contract
to
pay
25
cents
per
acre-foot
for
water
taken
for
domestic
use
stored
in
the
dam.
and
with
respect
to
the
arizona
contract,
it
also
provides
for
a
charge
not
to
exceed
25
cents
per
acre-foot.
i
am
speaking
of
the
water
contracts,
not
the
power
contracts.
mr.
attorney
general
but
where
the
provision,
mr.
justice
black,
that
no
charge
shall
be
made
for
the
storage
and
delivery
of
water
to
anyone
who
has
a
present
perfected
right
and
the
date
of
that
contract,
i
suppose
present
means
now,
is
1944.
throughout
days
and
--
not
--
not
a
penny
has
ever
been
collected
from
any
arizona
water
user
for
the
storage
and
delivery
of
water
under
that
provision,
nothing.
nevada
contract
does
provide
as
the
metropolitan
does
that
that
state
shall
pay
for
water,
25
cents
or
50
cents
in
the
case
of
water
taken
above
the
turbines
for
domestic
use.
and
nevada
has
paid,
the
metropolitan
water
district
has
paid
but
arizona
has
paid
nothing.
the
contract
provides,
nothing
shall
be
paid
with
respect
to
water
taken
for
any
present
perfected
right
and
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
bulk
of
the
users
in
arizona
originated
after
1929.
the
projects
weren't
built
until
after
then,
the
(inaudible).
nevertheless,
no
charge
has
ever
been
collected
from
arizona
for
irrigation,
domestic
use
of
water.
nothing
has
ever
been
collected
from
palo
verde
irrigation
district
in
california,
yet,
also
had
a
water
right.
the
practical
administration
of
the
project
act,
i've
--
i've
switched
now
to
talk
about
these
water
contracts,
has
been
not
to
collect
from
anybody
except
the
metropolitan
water
district.
and
that
is
for
the
reason
that
its
right,
clearly,
is
dependent
upon
the
existence
of
storage.
the
others
had
preexisting
rights.
but
i
started
on
the
trail
of
telling
you
about
these
power
contracts
and
the
power
regulations
of
1930
for
the
reason
that
here
is
the
interstate
percentage
pro
rata
allocation
made
by
the
secretary
of
interior
under
section
5
of
the
project
act
dealing
with
power.
now,
did
he
do
that
with
respect
to
water?
he
did
not.
instead,
he
wrote
the
letter,
i've
referred
to,
to
the
palo
verde
irrigation
districts
and
you
don't
need
any
contract
at
all
if
you
have
a
natural
flow
right.
he
never
made
any,
by
he
--
i
mean,
any
secretary
of
interior.
never
put
his
pen
at
any
piece
of
paper
like
the
power
regulations
that
make
any
interstate
allocation
of
water.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir,
this
is
special
master's
exhibit
number
4.
the
particular
page
for
the
1930
power
contract
general
regulations
is
page
a237.
now,
to
follow
the
power
story
unto
a
little
further,
in
--
by
--
by
1940,
it
had
become
necessary
to
readjust
the
hoover
dam
power
rates
to
bring
them
in
more
nearly
in
the
competition
of
those
established
in
bonneville.
the
seven
states
said
the
colorado
river
basin
adjoined,
for
the
first
and
last
time
that
i
know
of,
the
14
senators
or
sponsors
of
a
single
bill
to
reestablish
the
rate
basis
of
hoover
dam.
the
statute
that
did
that
is
called
the
“boulder
canyon
project
adjustment
act”.
it
is
the
act
of
july
19,
1940,
54
stat.
774.
now,
under
that
statute,
again,
the
metropolitan
water
district
of
southern
california
was
set
by
the
secretary
of
interior
as
a
primary
obligor.
it
pays
for
35%
of
the
cost
of
hoover
dam,
a
dam
from
which
it
will
be
denied
all
water
whatsoever
if
the
master's
decree
is
approved
and
if
the
colorado
river
compact
is
ever
enforced,
which
it
will
be,
to
restrict
the
water
supply
in
the
main
river.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
metropolitan
water
district's
water
rights
by
a
federal
contract
as
well
as
by
the
terms
of
the
state
priorities
enforced
in
these
contracts
are
junior
to
agricultural
priorities
in
california
to
such
an
extent
that
if
the
colorado
river
compact
has
ever
enforced
against
the
lower
basin,
this
great
district
that
face
35%
of
the
cost
of
the
dam
that
makes
all
of
the
water
here
in
dispute
available,
gets
not
one
drop
of
it.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
in
1930,
the
first
of
these
suits
was
brought
here,
arizona
versus
california
283
u.s.
before
i
take
up
what
happen
in
that
suit,
may
i
say
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
oh,
pardon.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
--
the
same,
that
the
setting
up
of
internal
priorities
of
california,
which
subjugated
metropolitan
to
the
agricultural
users
was
delayed
until
about
a
month
after
the
decision
came
down
in
the
first
of
these
cases
283
u.s.
and
the
priorities
that
mr.
justice
brandeis
bare
said
should
have
interstate
effect,
under
section
18,
had
to
be
recognized
and
were
recognized
as
senior
to
those,
the
metropolitan
intrastate.
the
great
tragedy
we
now
face
is
with
those
same
senior
priorities
are
blunted
and
denied
interstate
effect
so
that
the
metropolitan
is
impaled
by
them.
but
to
answer
your
question
directly,
the
--
the
internal
division
of
california
was
made
after
the
decision
of
283
u.s.
subsequently
few
years
later,
the
secre
--
secretary
wilbur
had
signed
regulations
setting
up
a
draft
of
a
contract
with
arizona
and
secretary
ickes
withdrew
them
on
the
basis
of
the
decision
made
in
283
u.s.
saying
in
retrospect
that
now
appears
that
the
appropriative
rights
of
arizona
are
unaffected
by
anything
done
under
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
and
it
seems
therefore
unwise
for
us
to
attempt
by
a
contract
to
make
any
reservation
of
water
for
arizona,
her
appropriative
rights
have
continue.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
your
honor,
it
--
it
truly,
i
--
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
that
may
have
been
the
political
motivation
for
--
for
it
but
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
the
intra-basin,
the
rights
of
arizona
versus
california.
in
19
--
in
1930
--
does
that
answer
your
question?
i
would
like
to
follow
through
this
trail
of
the
power
contract
for
a
minute
because
of
the
contrast
of
what
the
secretary
did
about
the
water.
under
the
1940
boulder
canyon
project
adjustment
act
when
it
was
pending,
the
senators
of
these
seven
states
wrote
in
to
section
14
of
that
act
precisely
the
language
of
section
18
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
that
nothing
herein
shall
be
construed
as
interfering
with
the
rights
of
the
states
with
respect
to
the
waters
--
within
their
boundaries
and
so
on.
and
it
went
on
to
restate
that
sections
13
(b),
(c)
and
(d)
of
the
project
act
should
continue
in
full
force
in
effect.
those
are
the
sections
that
make
the
colorado
river
compact
controlling
in
every
respect
in
the
interpretation
of
the
project
act.
now,
secretary
ickes,
pursuant
to
that
authority,
again
signed
general
regulations
affecting
the
division
of
the
--
of
the
power,
interstate
by
--
by
percentages.
those
appear
at
page
a279
of
the
same
special
master's
exhibit
4.
at
page
a281
appears
a
schedule
to
the
state
of
nevada
so
much,
state
of
arizona
so
much,
metropolitan
water
district
so
much
and
so
on.
now,
here
is
a
type
of
an
administrative
action
you'd
expect
if
the
secretary
of
interior
was
going
--
so
in
the
section
5,
the
same
section
5
any
authority
to
him
to
make
a
pro
rata
interstate
apportionment
of
water.
the
same
two
secretaries,
wilbur
and
ickes,
did
nothing
of
the
kind.
they
did
the
reverse.
secretary
wilbur
instructed
his
representative,
who
is
a
man
named
van
noorden
and
who
had
written
that
he
was
about
to
attend
an
interstate
meeting
on
the
water
allocations.
he
instructed
him
by
telegram
in
september
27,
1929,
this
is
california's
exhibits
7553
for
identification.
it
read
“your
message
is
here.
we
have
endeavored
to
keep
out
of
all
controversy
regarding
allocation
of
lower
basin
water.
do
not
consider
this
our
field
once
your
help
on
technical
questions
but
do
not
want
you
to
represent
me
in
any
conference
on
allocation
of
lower
basin
water.
what
you
may
do
individually
is
a
different
question.”
that's
kind
of
blunt
instructions.
secretary
wilbur
was
not
a
man
to
talk
shorthand.
he
wrote
to
the
state
of
california
and
to
the
--
to
the
agencies
in
california
requesting
that
they
submit
to
him
a
proposed
division
of
the
water
to
be
made
internally
in
california.
and
this
is
beside
the
priority
question
for
a
moment.
but
again,
to
illustrate
the
chair
with
which
the
secretary
of
interior
on
1930
was
keeping
out
of
the
water
allocation
business.
and
here,
he
requested
the
--
the
states
to
submit
recommendations
of
this
sort.
he's
--
this
is
over
ray
lyman
signature,
ray
lyman
wilbur
signature
and
he
submits
a
draft
of
recommendations
to
be
made
by
the
california
division
of
water
rights
to
the
secretary
of
interior.
this
is
california
exhibit
number
1810.
and
he
wants
the
state
to
send
back
this
recommendation
to
him,
leaving
--
he
gives
blanks
that
i
want
filled
in,
says
he.
it
is
recommended
that
the
water
which
maybe
available
to
california
under
the
colorado
river
compact
is
limited
by
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
the
apportion
as
follows:
one,
of
the
water
which
maybe
available
to
california
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
now,
that
the
secretary
of
interior
talking
shorthand
when
he
says
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
compact
--
mr.
attorney
general
is
he
talking
about
the
something
other
than
paragraph
(a)
which
encompasses
tributaries?
is
he
talking
about
the
red
river?
he
doesn't
say
so.
now,
that's
beside
the
priority
question.
that's
the
limitation
question.
but
in
chronological
order,
i
want
to
get
before
you
as
graphically
as
i
can
what
these
four
secretaries
of
interior
did.
where
is
this
illusive
piece
of
paper
that
somebody
must
have
signed
to
make
an
interstate
apportionment?
it's
either
wilbur
or
krug
--
wilbur
or
ickes
or
krug
or
chapman.
those
are
the
four.
and
who
done
it?
who
done
it?
you
won't
find
the
corpse
because
there
isn't
any.
and
you
won't
find
that
any
secretary
of
interior
did
it
because
nobody
ever
signed
this
piece
of
paper.
what
they
did
was
precisely
the
opposite.
in
direct
contrast
with
the
power
regulations,
we
did
make
this
interstate
allocation.
when
secretary
ickes
made
his
contract
with
arizona
in
1944,
here,
if
anywhere,
you
must
find
the
interstate
allocation.
bear
in
mind
that
for
14
years,
there
had
been
in
existence
only
the
regulations
contract
signed
by
wilbur
and
the
two
in
nevada
signed
by
ickes,
one
at
nevada.
now,
none
of
these
purport
to
make
an
interstate
allocation.
the
california
projects
had
been
built.
they
were
in
existence.
now,
are
we
going
to
read
in
section
5
handwritten,
the
subliminal
message,
“to
california,
if
you
accept
this
limitation
act
taking
4,400,000
as
the
ceiling
on
your
appropriation
should
do
so
with
the
implied
knowledge
that
some
secretary
of
interior
is
going
to
come
along
14
years
later
after
your
projects
are
built
and
then
impose
an
allocation
on
you.
or
do
your
contracts
for
“permanent
service”
give
you
what
the
master
calls
the
assurance
of
a
stable
water
supply.
we've
built,
we've
built.
283
u.s.
have
come
down
in
which
the
quote
to
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
in
effect

292
u.s.
have
come
down
of
which
arizona
had
sued
to
perpetuate
the
testimony
of
the
--
of
the
colorado
river
compact
negotiators.
and
here,
this
court
said
that
the
limitation
related
the
california
limitation
to
the
iii
(a)
and
iii
(b)
waters
in
the
sense
of
the
system.
arizona
had
sued
to
stop
the
--
the
united
states
had
had
to
sue
arizona
to
stop
the
military
interference
of
the
building
of
parker
dam.
and
this
court,
in
that
case,
had
said
that
arizona
owns
the
bed
and
banks
of
the
stream
from
the
thread
of
the
river
at
east
and
had
a
right
to
appropriate.
and
this
is
what
this
court
said
in
that
case
in
denying
the
right
of
the
united
state
to
enjoin
arizona's
military
interference
with
parker
dam's
construction.
arizona
owns
the
part
of
the
riverbed
that
is
east
to
the
thread
of
the
stream.
her
jurisdiction
in
respect
to
the
appropriation
use
and
distribution
of
an
equitable
share
of
the
waters
flowing
therein
is
unaffected
by
the
colorado
river
compact
or
federal
reclamation
law.
so
that
secretary
icke,
in
1944,
had
had
the
advantage
of
reading
four
decisions
of
this
court
dealing
with
the
colorado
river
question
and
he
surely
could
not
find
in
any
of
those
decisions,
any
determination
aid
that
the
--
the
reference
to
the
colorado
red
river
compact
means
something
other
than
the
compact,
the
fond
of
water
that
i
--
secretary
administering
is
different
from
that
which
statutes
seems
to
talk
about
nor
could
he
find
in
that
statute
any
obligation
of
priorities.
so
that
when
the
arizona
water
contract
was
signed
in
1944,
it
doesn't
purport
to
be
an
interstate
allocation
at
all.
secretary
ickes
was
just
as
careful
as
secretary
wilbur
to
stay
out
of
that
business.
let's
look
at
the
arizona
water
contract.
here,
if
anywhere,
you
find
the
piece
of
paper
which
is
the
interstate
apportionment
and
what
do
we
find?
this
begins
at
page
399.
the
very
first
preliminary
paragraph
says
this
contract
is
made
as
such
in
such
a
date
under
the
act
of
congress
approved
june
17,
1902.
that's
the
reclamation
law
enacts
amendatory
thereof
and
so
on
including
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
now,
the
fundamental
of
the
reclamation
law
is
section
8
which
provides
a
beneficial
use
shall
be
the
basis
to
measure
the
limit
of
the
right.
did
this
contract
attempt
to
setup
anything
other
than
beneficial
use
says
the
basis
to
measure
the
limit
of
the
right?
did
this
put
in
deep
freeze,
so
to
speak,
2,800,000
acre-feet?
now,
turn
to
page
400.
here
is
article
vii
(a),
delivery
of
water,
subject
to
be
availability
thereof
for
use
in
arizona
under
the
provisions
of
the
colorado
river
compact
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
united
states
will
deliver,
top
of
page
401,
a
maximum
of
2,800,000
acre-feet
up
to
a
maximum.
and
how
is
he
going
to
do
it?
it
is
--
he's
going
to
deliver
to
actual
users.
thereafter
shall
make
contracts
for
the
secretary
of
interior.
it
is
simply
a
--
an
expression
of
intent.
the
government
is
quite
explicit
about
this
in
saying
that
this
about
this
contract.
and
this
is
from
page
47
and
48
of
the
--
of
the
united
states
answering
brief.
it
is
our
understanding
that
this
contract
with
arizona
does
not,
by
itself,
authorize
the
actual
delivery
of
water
in
compliance
with
section
5
of
the
project
act
since
that
section
requires
that
the
contracts
be
entered
into
with
the
actual
users
of
water.
we
think
so
too.
united
states
goes
on.
rather,
this
contract
is
in
nature
of
a
commitment
by
the
secretary
to
enter
into
contracts
with
users
in
arizona
up
to
the
limit
of
2,800,000
acre-feet.
in
this
sense,
it
is
an
allocation
by
the
secretary,
that
amount
of
water
for
a
future
contractual
use.
we
say
there's
no
such
authority
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
of
the
secretary
of
interior
to
make
any
allotment
for
future
contractual
use.
he's
authorized
a
contract
with
users.
and
to
deliver
to
them
a
specific
name
points
on
the
river
or
on
the
canal.
any
contract
by
the
secretary
of
interior
that
seems
to
take
over
the
authority
to
make
an
interstate
apportionment
is
ultra
vires,
ultra
vires.
and
secretary
ickes
didn't
attempt
to
do
it
all.
here's
what
he
go
on
say.
he
says
at
page
40
--
page
405,
article
x.
“neither
article
vii”,
article
vii
is
the
one
that
provides
for
delivery
of
water,
“neither
article
vii
nor
any
other
provision
of
this
contract
shall
impair
the
right
of
arizona
and
other
states
and
the
users
of
water
therein
to
maintain
prosecutor
defend
any
action
respecting
and
result
prejudice,
too,
any
of
the
respective
contentions
of
said
states
and
water
users
as
to:
one,
the
intent,
effect,
meaning
and
interpretation
of
said
compact
in
the
said
act.
two,
what
part,
if
any,
of
the
water
used
or
contracted
for
by
any
of
them
falls
within
article
iii
(a)
of
the
colorado
river
compact.”
now,
let
me
pause
there
a
minute.
is
ickes
talking
shorthand
when
he
says
our
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact?
he
was
not
a
man
inclined
to
use
shorthand
either.
now,
it
passes
all
understanding
that
every
secretary
of
interior
for
all
of
these
decades
was
talking
shorthand
by
paragraph
(a)
of
article
iii
something
other
than
the
compact
said.
here,
he
goes
on
to
say,
“and
furthermore,
if
the
master
is
right,
this
is
wholly
irrelevant
question.
what
part
falls
within
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact?”
that's
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
ickes'
goes
on
to
say
“three,
what
part,
if
any,
is
within
article
iii
(b)
thereof?
four,
what
part
if
any
has
excess
or
surplus
waters
unapportioned
by
the
said
compact.
and
five,
here's
my
point,
"what
limitations
on
use,
rights
of
use
and
relative
priorities
exist
as
to
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system
provided
however,
by
--
by
these
reservations?
there's
no
intent
to
disturb
the
apportionment
made
of
article
iii
(a)
of
the
colorado
river
compact",
same
article
“between
the
upper
basin
or
the
lower
basin.”
now,
how
can
you
use
reference
to
article
iii
of
the
colorado
river
compact
in
the
disclaimer
at
the
end
as
meaning
of
something
other
than
the
same
article
when
he
refer
to
it
as
relating
to
their
respective
rights
of
these
lower
basins
states,
all
in
one
sentence.
but
the
significant
thing
is
if
the
secretary
of
interior
had
made
an
interstate
apportionment
that
wiped
out
relative
priorities.
why
in
the
world,
in
1944,
secretary
ickes
announcing
that
this
contract
that
does
not
make
any
determination
with
respect
to
relative
priorities.
if
the
master
is
right,
it
didn't
exist.
and
they
ceased
to
exist
by
the
secretary
signing
of
this
very
piece
of
paper.
this
is
the
piece
of
paper
if
any
is.
you
can't
find
anything
that
even
touches
it.
because
until
1944,
until
1944,
by
no
one's
contention
was
there
any
interstate
apportionment
made.
no
contractual
allocation
scheme
was
completed
or
came
into
existence
until
harold
ickes
signed
this
piece
of
paper
and
this
doesn't
do
the
job.
i
have
to
turn
back
to
page
403.
you'll
find
that
in
--
in
paragraph
--
paragraph
(l),
the
last
sentence,
“present
perfected
rights
to
the
beneficial
use
of
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system
are
unimpaired
by
this
contract.”
as
of
1944
--
present,
i
suppose
means
1944.
now,
at
the
same
time
the
secretary
ickes
signed
that
contract,
he
promulgated
a
decision
dated
february
9,
1944.
he'd
held
hearings
before
he
signed
that
contract.
this
appears
the
special
master's
exhibit
number
4
at
page
a567.
this
is
a
decision
in
which
he
explains
what
he's
done.
you
won't
find
here
the
statement
i
have
“forever
allocated”
or
i
have
“determined
priorities”
or
i
have
substituted
proration
with
priorities,
not
at
all.
he
says,
article
x,
that's
the
one
i
read
to
you
a
moment
ago
that
made
these
reservations,
was
purposely
designed
to
prevent
arizona
or
any
other
state
from
contending
that
the
proposed
contract
or
any
provision
of
the
proposed
contract
resolves
any
issue
on
the
amounts
of
water
which
are
apportioned
or
unapportioned
but
the
compact,
any
amounts
of
apportion
or
unapportioned
of
water
available
to
their
respective
states
under
the
compact
and
the
act.
it
expressly
reserves
for
a
future
judicial
determination
any
issue
involving
the
intent,
effect,
meaning
and
interpretation
of
the
compact
and
act.
the
language
of
article
x
is
plain
and
unequivocal
and
adequately
reserves
all
questions
of
interpretation
of
the
compact
and
the
act.
now,
there
is
not
the
announcement
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
--
that
i
had
made
an
interstate
apportionment,
i
have
forever
allocated,
i
have
substituted
proration
with
priorities.
here
is
an
announcement
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
all
questions
as
to
relative
priorities
are
reserved.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
yes,
your
honor,
the
--
the
master
reaches
his
result
by
interpreting
these
documents
as
affecting
the
contractual
allocation
as
making
it
---
being
a
contractual
allocation
scheme,
the
secretary
apportionment.
we
say
they
conflict
in
the
sense
they
just
don't
do
any
such
thing.
they
just
claim
it.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
your
honor,
we
think
they
empathically
are.
with
respect
to
california
contracts,
these
--
first,
those
are
the
ones
that
would
be
undermined
and
in
effect
destroyed.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct,
quite
so.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
if
i
can
sort
out
my
reply
to
that
in
two
or
three
components.
but
first,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
--
we
--
we
conceive
the
contracts
made
under
section
5
with
the
california
users
has
been
true
section
5
contracts
to
the
type
the
united
states
talks
about
the
contracts
with
--
with
users
for
permanent
service.
we
treat
those
and
any
section
5
contract
that
conforms
to
the
requirement
and
being
a
contract
with
the
user
as
being
in
a
sense,
a
--
an
initiation
of
an
appropriation
stored
water
under
federal
law.
these
contracts
to
us
are
licenses
or
permits
to
appropriate
stored
water.
no
one
may
have
the
use
of
stored
water
without
a
contract.
but
having
a
contract,
he
has
the
same
thing
as
a
license
to
hunt
birds
or
a
permit
from
the
state
to
appropriate
water.
he
doesn't
have
any
grant
or
patent.
he
may
then
put
the
water
to
use.
and
thereupon,
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
becomes
controlling.
that
is
a
control
over
the
effect
of
section
5
contract's
beneficial
use.
these
are
basis
of
measuring
the
limit
of
the
right.
as
the
court
said
in
ickes
versus
fox,
united
states
is
a
carrier
of
water
under
its
contracts
to
the
man
who
is
establishing
the
right
to
--
right
to
that
water
by
its
user.
and
under
section
8,
in
general,
that
water
is
appurtenant
to
land
as
a
property
right.
the
law
of
relation
back
applies.
to
our
mind,
the
contract
with
arizona
is
not
that
at
all,
it
doesn't
purport
to
be.
if
the
united
states
puts
its
finger
right
on
it,
it
is
not
a
section
5
contract
at
all,
at
all.
it
is
--
if
given
that
effect
as
an
apportionment,
as
a
reservation
and
perpetuity
for
arizona,
it's
ultra
vires,
secretary
didn't
have
it.
the
wrong,
the
master's
(inaudible)
is
by
his
--
creating
the
arizona
contract
of
1944
as
only
it
were
authorized
by
statute
to
be
and
it
in
fact
was
an
apportionment
in
substitution
for
interstate
compact.
there
just
isn't
any
such
creature
contemplated
by
the
statute.
the
arizona
contract
re-visualize
as
nothing
more
than
an
announcement
by
the
secretary
of
the
amount
of
to
which
he
will
contract
with
individual
users
in
arizona
just
as
the
california
limitation
act
was
a
determination
of
the
ceiling
up
to
which
he
might
contract
with
users
in
california.
he
didn't
call
it
limitation
by
agreement
if
you
like.
it's
--
if
the
limitation
act
is
not
a
grant
of
anything
to
california
as
the
master
concludes,
and
i
--
i
think
he's
probably
right
about
it,
then
the
arizona
contract
is
no
grant
of
anything
that
arizona.
it's
a
statement
of
the
conditions
on
which
he
will
contract
with
individual
users
up
to
a
ceiling
that
may
or
may
not
ever
be
reached.
and
if
this
tri-state
compact
had
been
signed
between
arizona
or
ratified
between
arizona,
california
and
nevada.
that's
where
the
master
says
that
the
secretary
got
these
figures
and
i
don't
doubt
he
did.
but
if
that
--
if
that
interstate
compact
had
become
effective,
then,
as
to
arizona
and
nevada,
it,
too,
was
a
ceiling
on
appropriations.
merciful
heavens
if
the
colorado
river
compact
itself
is
just
a
ceiling
on
appropriations
in
the
master
says
and
if
the
limitation
on
california
is
a
limitation,
not
a
grant,
it's
inconceivable
that
this
tri-state
compact,
we
were
invited
to
sign,
is
somehow
a
limitation
on
california
but
a
grant
to
arizona
and
nevada.
they
have
same
effect
on
all
three
of
us,
some
sort
of
a
reciprocal
ceiling
on
appropriations.
now,
the
arizona
contract
certainly
can't
do
anymore
for
arizona
than
the
ratification
of
that
tri-state
compact
would've
done.
even
assuming
that
the
secretary
did
somehow,
somewhere
get
some
authority
to
impose
a
federal
apportionment
on
us.
so,
it
is
not
so
much,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
what
this
master
has
done
that
violates
--
the
effect
of
the
contracts.
its
40
years
read
into
section
5
and
into
the
arizona
contract
is
just
isn't
there
and
never
intended
to
be
there.
now,
i
--
i
like
to
make
this
plain.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
are
not
saying,
we
are
not
saying
that
our
second
string
to
our
bow
the
continuation
of
a
--
principles
of
equitable
apportionment
depends
upon
our
proving
to
you
that
we
have
somehow
a
state
generated
right
to
control
the
united
states
in
the
disposition
of
the
water
stored
at
hoover
dam.
that
is
not
it
at
all.
now,
for
purposes
of
argument,
i
would
start
with
the
position
that
if
this
statute
had
said,
“we
impound
the
unappropriated.”
i
emphasize
unappropriated
waters,
that
in
hoover
dam
and
we
direct
that
they'll
be
put
in
tank
cars
and
taken
to
new
york
and
sold
as
bottled
water,
that
the
statute
could
have
done
so
and
that
the
secretary
of
interior
wouldn't
have
to
come
to
arizona
or
nevada
or
california
for
permission
to
do
it
either.
and
much
as
in
the
ashwander
case
is
--
the
government
can
dispose
a
power.
that's
not
it.
the
question
here
is
one
of
statutory
interpretation,
what
did
the
united
states
intend
with
respect
to
the
newly
created
resource?
and
what
is
the
newly
created
resource?
it's
the
water
unappropriated.
by
unappropriated,
i
mean
the
water
beyond
--
beyond
that
to
which
valid
existing
rights
are
attached
under
state
law
even
though
not
fully
put
to
use
as
of
1929.
i
don't
think
this
statute
wiped
out
the
law
of
relation
back.
but
the
question
is
one
of
statutory
interpretation,
what
did
congress
intend
with
respect
to
this
newly
created
--
newly
created
research?
mr.
attorney
general
well,
the
--
we
don't
deny
that.
it's
the
incremental
supply.
mr.
attorney
general
we
say,
we
offer
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
because
we
--
we
have
proof
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
on
anticipating
that
for
our
issue.
how
much
could
we
have
taken
out
of
the
unregulated
river
by
our
own
efforts?
and
the
proof
uncontroverted
is
that
it
could,
by
our
own
works
and
taking
the
regiment
of
the
river
as
it
existed
prior
to
regulation,
had
actually
diverted
and
used
in
california
about
4,500,000
acre-feet
per
year.
we
could
not
have
used
the
6,000,000
that
hiram
johnson
talked
about.
the
true
figure
developed
by
the
engineers
on
the
stand,
subject
to
cross-examination
is
that
the
--
we
could,
without
hoover
dam,
storage
have
taken
and
used
in
california
about
4,500,000
acre-feet
per
year
under
appropriations
that
were
in
excess
of
that
and
all
of
them
senior
to
arizona's
appropriation.
mr.
attorney
general
--
i
did
not
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
the
proof
was
that
the
--
taking
the
river
as
it
came,
high
and
low.
we
could
have,
in
fact,
have
obtained
that
quantity
out
of
the
year.
the
proof
is
that
in
only
some
54
months
out
of
--
out
of
something
over
600
months
of
the
period
involved
in
the
study,
would
there
have
been
any
reachable
shortage
at
all.
now,
what
the
--
this
--
the
specific
problem
is,
and
what
i'm
attempting
to
say,
is
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
intended
with
respect
to
the
incremental
stored
water,
however
you
define
it,
to
apply
to
that
water
the
principles
build
up
by
this
court
in
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment.
i
am
taking
the
instance
now
in
which
the
--
the
hypothetical
project
is
using
water
that
would
not
have
existed
at
all
before
the
creation
of
hoover
dam.
this
is,
we'll
say,
stored
water
by
anybody's
definition
and
ignoring
what
the
definition
maybe.
and
we
have
competitors
who
each
hold
a
contract
for
the
use
of
stored
water.
there
is
not
enough
to
satisfy
both
of
them.
what
happens?
the
master's
very
clear
if
these
two
competitors
are
within
the
same
state,
arizona
let
us
say.
they
both
depend
on
contracts.
neither
of
them
had
any
antecedent
right
under
state
law.
they're
both
revealing
solely
with
incremental
stored
water.
priority
applies,
state
law
controls.
the
very
question
says
he
of
whether
a
contract
constitutes
a
water
right
is
to
be
controlled
by
state
law.
now,
that's
quite
a
concession.
that
the
very
question
of
whether
a
contract
with
the
united
states
constitutes
a
water
right
at
all,
it's
a
question
of
state
law
says
he.
but
in
any
event,
if
these
competitors
are
both
in
arizona,
priority
controls,
priority
is
applied.
if
they're
both
in
california,
priority
controls.
if
one's
in
california
and
the
other
is
in
arizona,
but
above
hoover
dam,
priority
controls.
we're
invited
to
come
back
to
this
court
to
sue
anybody
that
depletes
the
flow
of
the
river
by
a
new
diversion
above
hoover
dam.
priority
will
control
even
though
the
right
we
here
assert
is
that
solely
of
a
contract
user,
a
--
a
contract
holder
has
no
preexisting
right
in
--
under
state
law
at
all,
priority
preserved.
now,
the
very
narrow
question
is
did
or
did
not
congress
intend,
having
to
recognize
priority
of
appropriation
and
surviving
everywhere
except
in
this
narrow
little
field
of
competitors
on
opposite
sides
of
the
river
below
hoover
dam,
didn't
intend
somehow,
but
i'm
saying
say
so,
that
priority
maybe
abrogated
by
the
secretary
of
interior
if
he
feels
like
it,
it's
his
discretion
and
then
did
any
secretary
undertake
to
do
it?
the
answer
is
no
in
both
instances.
why
write
into
the
statute
section
12
which
defines
reclamation
law
of
section
14
that
says
that
this
act
is
a
supplement
to
the
reclamation
law
which
shall
control
unless
otherwise
specifically
provided.
unless
they
intended
that
section
8
of
the
reclamation
law
be
given
effect,
that
beneficial
use
is
the
basis
for
the
measurement
of
the
limit
of
the
right
and
why
put
in
section
18
after
senator
king,
it's
author
had
ex
--
expressed
his
vast
discontent
with
the
notion
that
the
federal
government
somehow
delay
its
mighty
hands
on
the
river
dividing
up
the
water
except
for
reassurance
that
state
priorities
are
to
be
preserved?
and
why
did
this
court
say
in
283
u.s.
of
section
18
should
have
precisely
that
effect
and
therefore
arizona
was
not
wounded
by
the
passage
of
the
project
act?
and
why
in
offering
to
california
the
limitation
referred
to
california
as
right
which
may
now
exist
if
they're
cut
off
at
the
level
of
the
users
therefore
made
of
them?
these
things
are
all
--
are
all
in
the
notion
that
somehow
priorities
were
abrogated
is
foreign
to
anybody's
thinking
in
--
in
this
basin
or
in
any
litigation
here
from
the
beginning.
it
cannot
be
found.
now
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
talking,
your
honor,
of
two
kinds
of
priorities
with
the
same
result.
one
is
a
right
of
a
project,
let
us
take
the
palo
verde
irrigation
district
with
state
generated
water
rights,
priority
is
dated
from
1877.
and
we'll
assume
that
this
prior
to
palo
verde
irrigation
district
had
a
valid
appropriative
right
for,
let
us
say,
400,000
acre-feet
per
year,
take
any
figure
you
like
if
that
will
do,
was
proceeding
to
put
that
water
to
use
with
due
diligence,
came
1929
and
it
had
in
fact
put
to
use
say
100,000.
we
say
that
the
priority
of
the
palo
verde
irrigation
district
continues
and
is
not
struck
down
by
the
project
act
to
the
full
400,000
acre-feet
if
that
water
is
put
to
use
with
reasonable
diligence
after
1929.
the
period
of
reasonable
diligence
been
affected
by
the
magnitude
of
the
project,
the
quantity
of
water.
that's
still
good
against
arizona.
we
think
this
court
said
so
in
283
u.s.
to
arizona
against
us
with
respect
to
any
arizona
project
similarly
situated.
second,
with
respect
to
a
--
a
water
right
that
was
initiated,
let
us
say,
after
the
passage
of
the
project
act
in
1930
by
the
signature
of
a
water
storage
and
delivery
contract
by
someone
else,
it
happens
that
all
of
the
california
projects
had
initiated
appropriations
under
state
law
prior
to
1929,
the
most
recent
of
them
being
the
metropolitan
water
district
which
had
filed
this
notice
of
appropriation,
spent
$2,000,000
in
--
in
truly
gigantic
preliminary
work.
but
let's
say
that
we
had
no
such
project
with
any
--
any
roots
at
all
prior
to
1929,
this
is
project
x,
i
don't
what
project
that
is
going
to
exist,
but
let's
preposterous
say
that
here's
a
california
project
that
nobody
ever
thought
of
before
1930
and
it
came
into
the
secretary
of
interior
and
got
a
store
--
water
storage
and
delivery
contract
and
it
did
went
ahead
and
built
that
project
and
put
the
water
to
use
and
then
now
comes
along
a
project
in
arizona,
which
in
some
later
date,
1933
let
us
say,
came
to
the
secretary
and
got
a
contract
and
built
this
project,
put
that
water
to
use
and
comes
a
time
when
there's
a
shortage
on
both
these
contract
holders
cannot
be
satisfied,
what
law
shall
govern
in
--
in
distributing
the
shortage?the
master
would
say
proration.
he
would
go
further
than
that
and
apply
proration
even
though
our
california
project
is
one
that
builds
and
operating
along
before
1929.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
and
i'm
trying
to
simplify
this
by
assuming
just
one
project
in
existence
on
each
side
of
the
river
for
the
moment.
we
say
that
the
doctrine
of
priority
of
appropriation
of
all
interstate
apportionment
applies
between
these
two
competing
projects,
one
in
arizona,
one
in
california,
even
though
they
both
derived
their
water
right
wholly
and
solely
from
contracts
with
the
united
states
relating
to
incremental
new
stored
water.
and
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
abrogate
the
principle
of
priority
in
the
distribution
of
shortages
of
stored
water
between
contract
holders.
we
do
not
depend
upon
the
fact
or
accident
that
one
or
the
other
of
them
may
have
roots
in
an
appropriation
filed
under
state
law.
we
say
congress
intended
to
apply
this
great
principle
hammered
out
by
this
court
for
the
adjustment
of
shortages
in
the
western
states.
you
do
it
by
priority
of
appropriation.
and
it
doesn't
any
just
doctrinaire
notion.
it's
founded
on
the
necessity
of
life
in
the
western
states.
the
stability
of
water
supply
depends
upon
your
keeping
what
you're
put
to
use.
is
--
you
don't
jump
a
mining
claim.
you
don't
jump
an
appropriative
right.
they're
both
originated
at
the
same
time
and
by
the
same
doctrine
of
necessity
as
this
court
has
said
in
the
gerlock
(ph)
case.
and
that
congress
recognized
that.
it
didn't
intend
that
if
a
man
built
and
spent
$1
or
hundreds
and
millions
of
dollars
in
building
his
project,
it's
going
to
be
destroyed,
destroyed
by
proration
with
some
latecomer
at
a
later
time
that
it
intended,
it
priority
to
apply.
and
--
mr.
attorney
general
no.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir,
i
have
those
figures.
we
say
this,
your
honor,
if
i
answer
to
you
comes
in
--
in
under
three
--
i'll
give
you
three
figures.
first,
we
say
that
we
had
valid
vested
appropriative
rights
owned
by
projects
built
and
in
existence
to
the
--
in
which
could
have
been
satisfied
out
of
natural
flow
unregulated,
to
the
extent
of
4,490,500
acre-feet
per
year.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
these
two
are
not
related
and
i
--
i
do
enter
the
(inaudible)
two
lesser
figures
in
the
moment
before
i'm
held
to
this
one.
but
the
--
the
limitation
is
4,400,000
acre-feet
plus
one-half
of
the
excess
or
surplus.
we
think
that
the
dependable
supply,
this
river,
is
not
over
6,000,000
acre-feet
for
a
division
on
arizona,
california
and
nevada.
if
we're
right
about
that,
then
our
share
of
excess
or
surplus
would
be,
perhaps,
250,000
acre-feet
and
consequently,
if
--
if
we
prevail
and
if
you
took
our
rather
sovereign
to
serve
the
user
of
the
water
supply,
we
would
obtain
on
a
dependable
basis
of
about
4,600,000
acre-feet.
we
say
the
limitation
act
gives
4,400,000
or
rather
limited
as
to
that
and
that
the
translated
into
figures,
it
means
about
4,600,000
because
there's
no
more
than
400,000
acre-feet
of
service.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
arizona
--
mr.
attorney
general
under
--
well,
i
have
to
sort
this
out
again,
your
honor.
arizona's
2,800,000
to
a
couple
of
those
two
works
--
expressions
together,
arizona's
2,800,000
acre-feet
is
derived
from
a
contract
made
in
1944,
not
from
the
statute
the
master
so
holds,
the
statute
made
no
apportionment.
mr.
attorney
general
it
authorizes
the
states
to
agree
upon
that
figure
and
they
did
not
agree.
mr.
attorney
general
but
to
limit
on
california,
that
paragraph
is
operative
until
our
mind,
the
2,800,000
that
did
refer
to
as
to
arizona
includes
the
arizona
uses
on
the
tributaries.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
oh,
yes,
just
as
arizona
had
a
right
by
what
it
did
after
1929
to
put
to
use
of
water
which
might
diminish
the
quantity
that
california
might
get.
it's
not
the
fact.
it
was
done
before
or
after
1929,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct.
but
nevertheless,
to
the
extent
that's
her
appropriations
were
put
to
use
whether
before
or
after
1929,
it
might
substantially
reduce
our
quantity
available
for
us.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
on
your
--
say
thought
it
had
a
right
to,
i
--
i'll
put
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
in
italics.
yes,
i'll
put
that
in
italics.
mr.
attorney
general
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
yes,
to
give
you
a
direct
answer,
the
answer
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
if
we
prevailed
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
if
we
prevailed
here,
we
would
--
california
would
--
if
6,500,000
acre-feet
is
truly
available
under
--
on
the
mainstream
to
the
lower
basin
states
of
that
quantity,
california
might
have
4,400,000
acre-feet
plus
half
the
surplus
and
the
surplus
in
--
on
this
hypothesis
would
be
1,000,000
acre-feet.
we'd
have
4,900,000
of
the
six
and
a
half
million.
and
arizona
and
nevada
would
have,
out
of
the
main
river,
1,600,000,
the
residue
of
the
6,500,000.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct.
mr.
attorney
general
you
are
quite
--
quite
correct.
that
is
a
ceiling.
mr.
attorney
general
now
--
mr.
attorney
general
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
in
united
--
what
date
they
arose
or
how
it
approved
in
here?
mr.
attorney
general
well
--
mr.
attorney
general
no,
our
priorities,
in
all
respects,
relate
back
to
dates
prior
to
1929.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
your
honor,
we
do
not
feel
that
we
are
restricted
to
present
perfected
rights
in
any
respect.
the
limitation
refers
to
water
for
the
satisfaction
of
"right
which
may
not
exist"
that
is
a
less
restricted
quantity.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir,
they
are
in
two
ways.
the
article
iii
(a)
of
the
compact
provides
that
the
apportionment
of
7,500,000
acre-feet
to
the
lower
basin
in
perpetuity
shall
include
all
water
necessary
for
the
supply
of
any
right
which
may
now
exist.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
--
no,
that's
in
the
colorado
river
compact,
article
iii
(a).
the
statute,
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
in
section
4
(a)
proposes
to
a
california
a
limitation
in
quantitative
terms
which
shall
apply
to
two
categories
of
water
in
the
act
of
it.
one
is
right
which
may
not
exist.
the
other
is
uses
under
contracts
made
under
the
provisions
of
this
act.
we
say
that
rights
which
may
now
exist
are
intended
to
be
protected
within
the
apportionment
made
by
article
iii
(a)
and
that
arizona
in
ratifying
the
compact
in
1944
agreed
with
california,
she
agreed
with
the
other
states
and
that
was
so.
and
hence
that
our
4,400,000
acre-feet
is
intended
to
be
out
of
a
category
of
water
is
earmark
for
the
protection
of
rights
which
may
now
exist.
mr.
attorney
general
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
may
i
first
complete
the
--
the
--
when
mr.
justice
--
may
i
complete
this
(voice

--
mr.
attorney
general
i
will
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
come
to
that
if
i
finish
giving
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
black
as
called.
you
asked
for
us
a
figure
and
i
give
you
4,490,500
as
the
magnitude
of
california's
natural
flow
rights
as
of
1929.
the
question
now
is
that,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
and
i'm
intended
to
give
few
--
anyhow,
mr.
justice
black,
what
do
we
claim
within
that
to
be
present
perfected
rights
as
of
1929?
if
we
take
as
a
magnitude
of
present
perfected
rights,
the
quantity
that
could
have
been
diverted
by
actual
existing
structures
in
existence
in
1929,
the
figure
would
be
3,707,100.
these
two
figures
should
have
supported
by
citation,
the
4,490,500
acre-foot
figure,
you
will
find
in
california's
supplemental
findings
and
conclusions,
part
ix
(c)
that
is
bound
into
our
volume
called
“responses”
filed
before
the
special
master.
the
figure
of
3,707,100
is
in
the
same
document
and
it
is
finding
19
(d)
201.
we
have
a
third
figure.
if
we
are
restricted
as
the
master
would
do
to
the
quantity
in
fact
used
in
1929
and
the
figure
then
becomes
3,275,000
acre-feet
that
is
shown
in
our
findings
and
conclusions
in
19
(d)
202,
also
bound
in
the
responses.
now,
we
say,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
first
of
all,
when
we
speak
of
present
perfected
rights,
we're
on
the
wrong
railroad
track
as
measuring
the
--
the
magnitude
of
the
state
generated
prior
--
pre-1929
rights.
they're
bigger
than
present
perfected
rights
by
any
definition.
they
are
rights
which
may
now
exist
which
include
the
right
of
relation
back
and
that
consequently
the
figure
of
4,490,000
is
the
proper
measure
of
them.
but
if
--
if
the
master
should
be
sustained
that
present
perfected
rights
are
measured
by
the
quantity
in
fact
put
to
use
in
1929,
then
our
figure
becomes
3,275,000
thereabouts
and
arizona
is
about
250,000
and
nevada
is
substantially
zero.
we're
talking
about
an
aggregate
of
about
3,500,000
acre-feet.
now,
the
master
would
add
to
that
in
the
category
of
present
perfected
rights,
the
ultimate
requirements
of
indian
and
other
federal
reservations.
we
don't
agree
with
that.
but
if
you
have
those
in,
then
you
increase
the
arizona
figure
to
about
600,000
and
you
just
my
total
of
to
about
something
less
than
4,000,000.
but
if
--
if
present
perfected
rights
are
restricted
in
this
manner,
then
the
provisions
of
the
report
and
of
the
decree,
which
provide
for
two
years
of
attempted
negotiation,
failing
that
determination
by
this
court
of
a
magnitude
and
priorities
of
present
perfected
rights,
really
results
in
a
supplemental
decree
that
is
not
likely
to
ever
have
a
great
deal
of
utility
because
nobody
forecasts
that
the
flow
of
this
river
is
ever
going
to
get
down
to
4,000,000
acre-feet.
you're
never
going
to
reach
a
point
where
you
are
subsisting
on
present
perfected
rights
only
because
the
river
is
that
low
that
no
--
no
there's
no
evidence
to
support
that
--
that
notion
at
all.
the
true
significance
of
a
determination
of
--
of
present
perfected
rights,
it
seems
to
me
is
this.
if
the
master's
formula
is
approached
for
correcting
every
other
respect
is
wrong
in
this,
that
he
has
lumped
together
in
his
numerator
and
his
denominator
44/75ths,
28/75ths,
3/75ths,
this
present
perfected
rights
that
didn't
depend
on
storage
at
all,
though
should
be
subtracted.if
you're
dealing
with
an
allocation
of
“water
stored
as
aforesaid”,
the
incremental
stored
water
then
the
power
to
allocate
doesn't
go
further
than
the
power
to
store.
the
government
had
the
right
to
interrupt
and
store
the
unappropriated
water.
now,
we
said
the
inappropriate
water
is
much
narrower
margin
because
valid
appropriative
rights
should
all
be
subtracted
but
if
he
subtracted
only
the
present
perfected
rights
then
he's
got
the
wrong
equation
because
he's
much
in
the
position
of
saying
i
--
i
agree
that
bonds
have
our
priority
ahead
of
stocks
or
the
ventures.
but
in
the
event
of
insolvency
of
this
corporation,
i'm
going
to
give
you
pro
rata
as
your
numerator
of
your
fraction
on
your
total
holdings.
present
perfected
rights
being
bonds
and
stored
water
stocks
and
the
denominator,
the
total
quantity
of
the
water
that
i'd
like
to
be
able
distribute,
total
amount
of
resources.
and
it's
why
it
is
wrong
in
lumping
together
gold
and
silver
having
the
same
value.
but
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
that
is
our
assertion,
your
honor.
that
is
our
assertion
that
we
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
right.
mr.
attorney
general
we
agree
that
that
includes
our
present
perfected
rights,
that
limitation
they
entered.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
it
is
much
more
serious
than
that,
your
honor.
it
involves
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
may
i
--
you
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
a
one
feature
but
the
surplus
question
is
of
minor
importance
to
us
because
if
we're
right
about
the
water
supply,
there
isn't
much
surplus.
mr.
attorney
general
if
we
were
right
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
right.
your
honor
--
yes,
if
--
if
we
are
right
that
congress
intended
to
preserve
the
--
the
principle,
the
theory
of
equitable
apportionment,
whether
you're
dealing
with
incremental
stored
water
or
old
rights
then
we
don't
--
this
question
of
definition
of
person
perfected
rights
is
really
immaterial
to
us
because
--
it's
really
immaterial
because
we're
contending
for
the
principle
that
priority
applies
whether
you're
dealing
with
incremental
stored
water
or
water
that
you
could've
taken
out
of
natural
flow.
we
only
reach
the
question
of
what's
a
present
perfected
rights
if
we're
driven
back
to
away
from
that
and
you
prorate
the
store
water,
we
then
say,
well,
we'll
certainly
entitled
a
full
protection
of
the
priorities
of
our
preexisting
rights
and
they're
not
limited
to
present
perfected
rights.
and
as
a
third
line
of
defense,
we
say
that
if
you
are
going
to
respect
only
the
priorities
of
present
perfected
rights,
he's
got
to
--
he's
got
to
a
(inaudible)
definition
we're
entitled
to
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
it's
--
i
--
well,
i
--
i
misspoke,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
what
i
mean
to
say
is
quantitatively,
if
we're
sustained
on
the
application
of
priorities
to
the
incremental
stored
water
and
sustain
upon
the
principle
of
priorities
with
respect
to
the
rights
in
natural
flow,
the
question
of
how
much
of
the
rights
in
natural
flow
of
water
to
be
called
present
perfected
rights
doesn't
concern
us
because
it's
a
--
it's
a
small
portion
of
the
--
of
the
argument
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
now
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
it
had
a
--
a
definitely
defined
source.
it
came
into
the
statute
on
the
demand
of
an
upper
basin
representative,
not
in
the
senate
but
in
the
house
that
he
wanted
to
get
in
this
statute
some
indication
of
the
--
of
the
dam
that
was
going
to
satisfy
the
function
prescribed
in
article
viii
of
the
compact.
article
viii
of
the
compact
says
first
present
perfected
rights
are
unimpaired
by
this
compact.
and
second
that
when
storage
to
the
extent
of
5,000,000
acre-feet
has
been
provided,
then
present
perfected
rights
are
to
attach
to
that
storage
and
he
wanted
this
dam
named
as
that
storage
and
he
did
it.
and
he
was
very
careful
to
say,
this
is
mr.
carpenter
of
--
of
colorado,
he
was
very
careful
to
say
just
prior
this
was
being
done,
and
that
purpose
was
to,
as
i've
indicated,
to
protect
the
upper
basin.
and
he
made
it
very
clear,
indeed,
that
he
wanted
to
designate
this
--
this
dam
as
--
that
to
which
the
present
perfected
rights
were
apply
to
trigger
article
viii.
“it
had
nothing
to
do”,
he
said
with
a
determination
of
rights
between
arizona
and
california.
indeed,
arizona
and
nevada
are
both
quite
empathic
here
in
saying
that
section
6
of
the
project
act
has
only
inter-basin
effect.
and
we
don't
think
that
the
presence
of
section
6
in
the
statute
thereby
demand
of
an
upper
basin
representative.
that's
anything
at
all
to
do
with
limiting
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
in
lower
basin
to
the
protection
of
present
perfected
rights.
and
now,
if
you'll
bear
with
me
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
return
briefly
to
this
other
problem,
the
other
string
to
our
bow
of
--
of
the
--
the
limitation
question.
you
only
reach
this
problem
of
priorities.
if
you
hold
against
us,
if
you
hold
against
us
upon
our
limitation
issue,
and
let
me
just
briefly
answer
some
of
the
things
that
has
been
set
here
about
that,
the
question
is
not,
is
not
whether
california
shall
get
it's
4,400,000
acre-feet
out
of
the
stream
below
lake
mead
what
i
call
the
“red
river”,
of
course,
it
will.
that's
the
only
place
it
can
now
go
unless
they
builds
a
new
aqueduct
to
confine
above
lake
mead.
the
question
is
may
or
may
not
the
3,100,000
acre-feet
from
which
we're
excluded
be
claimed
against
the
red
river,
lake
mead
and
below
or
must
it
be
asserted
against
the
whole
lower
colorado
river
system
including
the
tributaries?
that
is
the
question
here.
you
don't
reach
your
question
of
shortage
unless
you
decide
that
question
against
us
because
the
flow
of
the
resource
of
the
lower
basin
including
the
tributaries
of
2,000,000
acre-feet
and
the
--
the
mainstream
is
adequate
to
sustain
the
8,500,000
acre-feet
to
which
the
lower
basin
is
restricted
by
the
colorado
river
compact.
you
run
into
the
problem
of
shortages
only
if
you
honor
the
3,100,000
acre-feet
of
claims
that
we
can't
have
and
which
we
perpetuated
against
the
stretch
from
lake
mead
and
down.
now,
as
to
this,
as
to
this,
there
is
in
the
master's
report
this
relationship
between
section
5,
on
which
i
have
devoted
so
much
time
today,
and
section
4
(a).
section
4
(a)
authorize
the
compact
among
arizona,
california
and
nevada
to
which
it
had
been
ratified
would
have
divided
up
the
waters
of
the
lower
basin.
now,
the
master
says
that
when
the
secretary
of
interior
under
section
5
made
water
delivery
contracts,
he
voluntarily,
although
not
obliged
to
do
so,
looked
to
section
4
(a)
to
the
figures
these
states
would
have
adopted
in
their
compact
and
they
ratified
it
and
picked
those
out
and
made
them
effective.
note
this,
section
5,
by
its
terms,
operates
only
with
respect
to
the
red
river
water
stored
and
lake
mead
and
below.
does
section
4
(a)?
of
course,
not,
of
course,
not.
whether
or
not
section
4
(a)
encompass
the
gila,
which
was
the
subject
of
the
--
of
the
legislative
material
offered
yesterday
by
the
solicitor
general,
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
debates
that
section
4
(a)
as
a
minimum
comprehended
that
main
river
from
lee
ferry
down
and
not
just
from
lake
mead
down.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
the
master
relies
upon
senator
pittman
and
senator
hayden.
but
those
senators
were
not
contending,
that's
the
compact
opposed
in
section
4
(a)
was
one
that
dealt
with
the
stream
from
black
canyon
or
boulder
canyon
to
mexico.
they
were
identifying,
they
were
misconstruing
the
compact
as
dealing
with
the
main
river
from
lee
ferry
to
mexico.
now,
there's
a
vast
difference.
the
inflow
between
lee
ferry
and
lake
mead
is
approximately
equal
to
the
gila
river
inflow
at
the
mainstream.
all
the
tributaries
in
the
lower
basin
in
the
state
of
nature
contributed
about
3,000,000
acre-feet
per
year
to
the
river.
and
though
that
the
gila
contributed
about
one-half.
so
we
are
--
there
is
a
disparity
between
section
4
(a)
arithmetic
that
resource
was
dealing
with
and
then
the
resource
dealt
within
section
5
to
the
extent
of
1,500,000
acre-feet
per
year.
they
can't
mean
the
same
thing.
now,
if
you,
consequently,
if
you
--
you
cannot
restore
the
rationale
of
the
master's
argument
by
correcting
his
truncation
of
the
river
at
lake
mead.
if
you
drew
that
river
back
together
again,
you
do
not
restore,
you
do
not
give
validity
to
his
interpretation
of
section
5
as
taking
into
--
putting
into
effect
the
tri-state
compact
because
it
can't.
we
are
dealing
with
entirely
separate
bodies
of
water.
may
i
have
that
map,
the
pictured
map?
mr.
attorney
general
now,
before
i
sit
down,
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
--
to
all
these
pictures
of
yesterday
of
the
--
the
water
flowing
out
of
the
imperial
valley
in
the
salt
sea.
but
he
did
not
tell
you,
it's
--
the
salt
content
of
this
river
as
he
call
it
is
higher
than
the
salt
content
of
the
colorado
flowing
into
mexico
which
has
occasion
this
current
international
crisis
to
which
mr.
justice
douglas
referred
to.
the
mexicans
are
complaining
because
the
water
reaching
them
in
the
main
colorado
river
has
a
salt
content
of
three
and
a
half
tons
per
acre-foot
and
they
can't
irrigate
with
it.
this
water
that
is
leading
the
imperial
valley
has
a
salt
content
of
four
and
a
half
to
five
tons
per-acre
foot.
we
can't
irrigate
with
it
anymore
than
the
mexicans
can
and
this
water
is
agricultural
sewage.you
see
it
the
sewer
flow
and
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
we
are
content.
we
would
happy
to
have
in
this
decree
exactly
the
same
provision
before
california
as
for
arizona
that
there
shall
be
no
waste
of
water.
we
applaud
that,
we
will
--
our
projects
were
held
to
a
higher
standard
of
efficiency
in
their
shore.
and
let
--
nobody
be
misled
that
there
is
vast
amounts
of
water
wasting
to
the
contrary.
now,
your
honors,
in
--
in
the
closing,
i
--
i
would
like
to
come
to
this.
we
are
defending
here
california
projects
built
at
a
cost
in
excess
of
$600,000,000
over
the
past
30
years.
the
youngest
of
them,
20
years
old,
serving
7
million
people
or
more
built
and
rely
and
it's
upon
an
agreement
with
the
united
states,
the
statutory
compact
that
our
legislature
accepted
in
good
faith.
the
great
principle
at
bay
here
at
stake
is
whether
a
state
may
safely
enter
into
an
agreement
with
the
congress
of
the
united
states
unambiguous
on
its
states,
unambiguous
on
its
states.
and
they
rely
upon
it,
built
our
projects
and
then
find
that
30
years
later
that
they
are
to
be
destroyed
by
an
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute
that
no
one
has
suggested
in
five
previous
trips
to
this
court.
yesterday
the
--
someone
objected
to
what
do
you
call
--
to
my
epithet
describing
this
as
a
patentable
novelty.
that
was
the
special
master
description
of
his
severance
of
the
limitation
from
the
compact,
not
ours.
he
said
if
these
were
a
patent
case,
i
would
claim
novelty
upon
this

the

projects
built

upon
the

promulgated
by
the

and
simultaneously
in

on

1929,
brought
back
to

four
times,
back

six
times
and
never
until
the

report
came
out

had
