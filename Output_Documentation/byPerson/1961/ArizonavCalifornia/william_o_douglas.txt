justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
all
taken
from
the
colorado?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
percentage
of
california's
use
of
the
colorado
river
water
takes
that
water
into
a
different
drainage
basin?
the
colorado
river
aqueduct
apparently
does
because
the
water
that
would
--
was
used,
would
be
left
over,
would
not
flow
back
into
the
colorado,
would
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
percentage
of
the
--
roughly,
is
there
any
table
or
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
don't
stop
to
ask
me
now
--
answer
now,
mr.
attorney
general,
but
i'd
be
interested
to
know
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
that
figure
would
be.
justice
william
o.
douglas
has
there
been
a
comparable
increase
in
arizona?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
--
before
you
start,
just
to
get
my
own
thinking
straight.
i
noticed
on
page
347
of
the
master's
report,
if
sufficient
mid
--
mainstream
water
is
available
to
satisfy
seven-and-a
half
million
acre-feet,
then
that
is
divided
in
a
certain
way,
is
this
--
is
that
the
--
the
point
of
the
division,
is
that
the
main
controversy
between
you
and
arizona?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
now
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
now,
on
page
21
of
your
brief,
in
the
first
full
paragraph
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
main
brief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
opening
brief.
you
further
narrow
the
issue
down
apparently
to
a
question
of
8
--
80,000
acre-feet
of
water,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
is
your
proposal,
is
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
except
for
80,000
people.
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
just
to
go
back
to
par
--
that
paragraph
on
page
347
of
the
master's
report.
but
this
--
this
mean
that
the
difference
on
this
point
between
you
and
arizona
would
be
resolved
if
the
apportionment
to
california
was
increased
by
80,000
acre-feet?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
not
as
simple
as
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
were
you
reading?
what
page
was
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
you
stop
for
a
minute?
give
me
the
reconciliation
between
the
table
that
you've
been
referring
to
on
page
118
of
the
master's
report
and
the
one
on
the
previous
page,
117.
justice
william
o.
douglas
they're
both
there
at
the
same
measurements
at
the
same
place
and
the
same
units
but
they're
vastly
different.
justice
william
o.
douglas
last
year,
by
sending
it
--
make
that
relevant
at
all
that
you
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
i
didn't
find
it
though.
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
does
it
rise,
in
arizona?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
was
the
date
of
the
colorado
river
aqueduct,
when
was
that
finished?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
any
finding
--
this
may
not
have
been
relevant.
i
noticed
in
some
account
recently
about
a
complaint
of
the
mexican
government
on
the
saltation
of
the
river.
is
there
any
reference
in
this
report
to
the
problem
of
saltation?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
they
have
drainage
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
had
quite
a
problem
with
that
in
nebraska,
in
north
platte
river
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
we
didn't
follow
--
we
didn't
follow
it
very
strictly,
did
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
sir.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
still
as
--
it's
still
as
a
classic,
your
honor.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
--
yes
sir.
it
will
--
will
still
the
most
comprehensive.
look,
i'm
very
sorry
if
we
haven't
decided
apportionship.
the
map
behind
me,
and
you
have
a
graphical,
shows
the
relative
humidity
of
the
various
states
of
the
united
states.
it
is
a
map
that
the
lines
drawn
through
points
of
equal,
annual
precipitation.
and
the
--
it
is
shown
in
three
shadings.
the
area
in
white
is
the
area
in
which
the
doctrine
of
priority
of
appropriation
has
completely
replaced
the
riparian
law.
the
dark
--
the
area
shown
in
light
gray,
the
eastern
part
of
united
states
is
that
in
which
the
riparian
law
is
still
prevails.
and
the
two
interiors
of
states
shown
in
darker
shading
are
those
in
which
a
mixture
of
riparian
on
appropriative
rights
prevails.
now,
the
great
distinction
between
the
riparian
doctrine
of
the
english
common
law
and
the
appropriative
doctrine
of
the
western
states
and
particularly
the
seven
states
now
before
is
this.
under
the
riparian
rule,
proration
is
a
rule.
it's
derived
from
the
law
of
torts.
the
law
of
river
should
flow
as
it's
accustomed
of
flow.
and
well,
you
may
consume
it
for
domestic
or
stock
watering
purposes
to
a
reasonable
amount,
we
respect
as
your
neighbors
needs
downstream,
you
can't
use
irrigation
that
way.
you
can
have
a
pro
rata
share
percentage.
now,
as
the
western
states
were
developed,
as
our
civilization
moved
into
dryer
and
dryer
countries,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
that
rule
is
found
totally,
totally
unacceptable
as
the
basis
for
the
stability,
the
security
of
projects
and
investments.
anyone
investing
great
sums
in
a
project
had
to
know
that
it
was
not
to
be
deluded
water
down
by
a
later
comer
who
might
ask
you
to
move
over
and
prorate
your
supply.
the
master
placed
in
his
report,
equates
the
term
in
the
project
act
of
permanent
service
with
a
necessity
for
stable,
a
firm
water
supply.
now,
in
these
seven
--
the
heartland
of
the
appropriation
doctrine,
the
doctrine
of
priority
of
appropriation
in
relation
back
as
distinct
from
proration
happens
to
be
the
states
now
before
you.
the
colorado
river
basin
has
drawn
here
in
this
white
area.
it
is
quite
true
that
california
does
have
restitutes
of
the
riparian
law
and
much
to
our,
should
grant
and
regret.
it
has
been
a
continuing
headache
with
which
the
courts,
the
legislature
and
finally
the
constitution
of
california
wrestle.
it
does
not
involve
the
problem
here.
there
are
no
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
--
under
this
law
the
--
all
state
rights,
the
rights
under
state
law
in
water
were
displaced
and
a
new
federal
domain
erected
over
the
dispensation
of
water?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
been
the
argument
--
that's
been
the
argument
the
government
has
been
trying
to
get
us
to
take
many
times
but
we've
never
done
it
so
far.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
--
i
say,
the
federal
government.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
know
the
cases?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
a
government
right
to
store,
comparing,
you
would
recognize
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
allocation
of
water
to
land
which
had
--
we'd
always
assume
under
all
the
federal
legislation
unless
this
changes
it,
it
was
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
there'd
be
no
recourse
in
these
--
and
you're
a
western
lawyer,
you
know
about
water
rights
probably
better
than
any
of
us,
but
would
these
be
compensable
interests
that
the
government
takes
them?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
--
under
the
law
--
the
water
rights
of
the
west
that
these
were
--
these
were
rights,
were
much
of
a
property
interest,
this
building
or
a
factory
or?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
power
can
protect
the
commerce
goes
way
up
into
the
tributaries
so
to
carry
that
out
logically
then
there
would
be
the
power
in
part
of
the
federal
government
to
destroy
all
the
subsidiary
property
rights
that
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
state
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
different
from
the
federal
government
then?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
--
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
justice
william
o.
douglas
were
you
in
california
filing
a
degree
upon
one
thing
then?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
--
does
that
include
taylor
grazing
act,
may
i
ask?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
don't
want
us
to
do
something
about
that,
too,
do
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
were
these
park
reservations
all
established
in
the
last
century?
justice
william
o.
douglas
before
1900?
were
they
all
established
before
1900?
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
takes
--
his
standard
is
the
amount
of
acres
within
the
--
that
each
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
reservation
there
could
be
irrigated.
justice
william
o.
douglas
whether
or
not
it
is
irrigated,
has
been
irrigated,
or
may
foreseeably
be
irrigated.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
what
the
court
did
in
the
winters
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it
is
difficult,
isn't
it,
to
imagine
a
buyable
reservation
in
a
desert
--
semi-desert
country
without
any
water?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
a
dried
semi-desert
area.
justice
william
o.
douglas
on
this
part,
you
agree
then
with
the
position
of
arizona
as
distinguished
from
the
position
of
california?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
--
you
go
with
arizona
in
the
--
as
respects
the
water
and
the
tributary?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
but,
below
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
below
lake
mead.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
far
as
i
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
far
as
i
said
earlier
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
you're
more
with
arizona
than
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
the
rep
--
and
the
standard
would
be
state
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
is
there
any
other
ways
since
the
1907
in
the
western
states
determining
water
rights
and
reference
to
state
law?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
a
theoretical
intervention.
i'm
saying
is
there
in
the
body
that
law
--
since
1907,
is
there
any
body
of
law
that
does
not
refer
to
state
law
to
define
water
rights
in
the
western
states?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
a
–
in
terms
of
quantity,
what
--
how
much
may
be
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
mechanism
--
is
the
mechanism
provided
by
the
state
law
for
protecting
a
right.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
know
how
important
this
is
but
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
just
so
to
want
me
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
that
construction
might
in
fact
change
state
law
of
governing
water
rights.
i'm
sure
it
was
in
the
state
of
washington.
i
don't
know
about
california.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
would
be
true
--
i
suppose
the
first
federal
then
--
the
reclamation
then,
when
was
it
1997?
that
would
be
true
of
any
federal
dams,
that
argument,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
law
has
been
quietly
opposite
as
you
know.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
secretary
is
not
on
this
--
does
not
form
a
dispensing
function
under
our
decisions
up-to-date,
he
sets
to
determine
under
state
law
who
has
the
perfected
right,
who
has
priority,
who
has
the
--
and
then
he
issues
it
at
to
them.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
at
the
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
ickes
case,
we
have
it
up
to
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
argument,
same
arguments
was
made
in
nebraska,
wyoming.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
wonder
mr.
solicitor
general
why
you
didn't
refer
us
to
section
14,
section
18
of
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
sorry.
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
your
own
time.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
i
thought
you
have
reached
that
point.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
would
surprise
i
assure
you,
lot
of
western
right
lawyers
to
that
statement
in
terms
of
what
it
is
the
perfected
water
right.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
speak
of
california
as
i
don't
know
or
arizona.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
page
are
you
on
now?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand
him
to
say
something
quite
different
that
at
the
bottom
of
page
203,
he
talks
about
interstate
rights
and
priorities
being
controlled
by
state
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
if
that's
what
you
said
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
right.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
on
the
water
irrigation,
water
rights,
you
disagree
then
with
the
master
on
page
217
when
he
says
that,
“only
secretary
has
authority
to
make
delivery
contracts.
he
has
no
power
to
make
a
delivery
contract
with
the
person
who
is
under
a
disability
to
receive
the
water
according
to
state
law,”
about
the
middle
of
the
page.
justice
william
o.
douglas
without
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
regardless
of
state
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
will
say
that
the
federal
government
has
been
consistent
throughout
the
years
in
trying
to
get
our
--
this
court
to
hold
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
would
--
the
significance
of
it
--
of
your
statement,
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
that
this
is
precisely
the
local
law
question?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
it
--
whether
what
is
perfected
when
a
water
right
is
acquired.
this
is
not
in
the
--
this
is
not
--
the
practice,
at
least
in
the
eight
western
states,
is
on
the
basis
of
statutes
and
court
decisions
as
to
when
it
is
perfected.
and,
i
have
no
doubt
of
what
--
you're
generalizing
it
and
putting
it
in
a
bold
type
for
a
hornbook
if
what
you
say
is
true,
but
the
important
thing
is
that
it's
a
local
law
question,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
section
14
ties
it
into
the
reclamation
act,
and
we
know
from
the
reclamation
act
that
that
was
--
all
of
these
rights
had
been
built
so
far
from
state
law,
maybe
not
by
reason
of
the
constitution,
but
by
reason
of
practice
or
statute.
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
i'm
sure
you're
wrong
on
that,
mr.
solicitor,
but
that's
not
relevant
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
now,
before
you
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
before
you
go
to
that.
you
see,
in
the
part
of
the
country
where
i
grew
up
and
briefly
practiced
law,
you
have
a
--
you
have
a
great
traffic
in
water
rights
like
chattel
or
chattels
that
have
no
relationship
to
any
of
the
things
that
you
have
said
in
terms
of
what
other
states
may
make
their
local
law.
this
is
a
very
complicated
problem.
it's
just
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
what
i'm
saying
preliminarily
is
not
to
engage
you
in
further
questioning,
except
this
question.
do
you
think
any
of
these
problems
are
necessary
for
decision
in
this
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
are
there
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
aren't
--
in
any
of
these
situations
in
this
record,
are
there
two
claimants
to
one
water
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'd
assume
that
it
was
in
most
of
our
western
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
of
the
--
to
prevent
the
speculators
from
coming
in
and
acquiring
water
rights
by
filing
as
you
do
for
mining
claims
in
some
states?
i
don't
know.
i
haven't
looked
into
it,
but
i
assume
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
it's
rather
common.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
we
disapprove
it,
we
would
be
deciding
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understood
that,
in
the
case
of
nevada,
that
what
the
secretary
did
was
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
an
agency
of
the
state
of
nevada.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
i'm
sorry.
justice
william
o.
douglas
were
there
any
such
rights
in
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
such
as
we
appointed
in
the
nebraska-wyoming
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
litigation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
true
in
nebraska
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
didn't
file
any
brief
at
all?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
because
she
had
not
read
or
have
the
compact?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
state
law?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
that
--
in
that
respect,
he
was
following
ickes
versus
fox
then?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
principle,
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
this
--
are
you
talking
about
intrastate
appropriations
in
arizona
or
intrastate
in
california
or
both?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
tried
to
do
substantially
that
in
ickes
versus
fox,
that
happens
to
be
--
that's
the
part
of
the
country
i
come
from
and
the
valley
that
was
developed
under
state
water
act.
that
was
the
effort
there,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
that
there
would
be
two
questions
of
that
--
in
that
category,
one
is,
whether
the
secretary
of
--
the
bureau
of
reclamation
proposes
to
depart
from
the
state
law
theory
here
or
secondly,
whether
that
presents
a
--
any
justiciable
question
at
this
time.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
--
do
you
think
that's
a
justiciable
question
now?
justice
william
o.
douglas
225.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
you're
saying
is
that
we
have
no
justiciable
issue
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
when
you
say
arizona
project,
that
may
be
a
misleading
not
purposefully
but
maybe
just
--
maybe
misleading
because
you
include
pres
--
you're
talking
about
existing
projects
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
suppose
from
the
first
argument,
i
gather
that
the
impression
that
the
importance
of
this
decision,
a
decision
in
this
case
was
to
let
the
states
know
authoritatively
how
much
water
each
had
so
that
it
could
turn
it
over
to
its
politicians
and
its
engineers
and
whatnot
for
future
additional
legislation
and
financing,
if
any
of
that
was
needed.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
went
into
section
4?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
rather
when
it
was
enacted
--
so
we
can't
any
longer
assume
that
--
that
everything
is
covered
--
is
covered
by
the
waters
that
are
impounded
the
dam?
justice
william
o.
douglas
maybe
that's
why
they
took
it
out,
maybe
the
--
for
the
benefit
of
section
5,
maybe
that
was
4.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
you
get
into
section
4,
then
i
would
think
that
you
are
in
great
difficulty,
not
perhaps
insuperable
but
you
find
in
section
4
of
the
project
act
as
i
read
this,
the
only
time
in
the
whole
history
of
any
of
this
laws
where
you
get
an
allocation
of
all
the
waters
at
the
gila
river
to
arizona.
and
that's
on
the
contingency
that
arizona
and
nevada
and
california
will
in
the
future
enter
into
some
compact
providing
for
that
allocation,
a
compact
that
as
i
understand
them,
has
never
been
executed.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
but
that
is
one
of
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
one
of
my
problems.
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
do
you
get
rid
of
the
definition
of
colorado
river
system
and
the
compact?
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
project
does
incorporate
to
ratify
the
compact
and
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
then
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
project,
that
proves
the
compact.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
the
compact
says
that
the
colorado
river
system
means
the
colorado
river
and
all
its
tributaries,
not
just
the
water
above
at
certain
points?
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
is
a
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
was
a
negative
implication
perhaps
in
section
4
(a)
that
what
--
the
contrary
is
true
by
reasons
of
the
fact
that
it's
--
the
congress
in
the
project
act
in
section
4
(a)
shows
how
arizona
can
get
exclusive
use
of
the
gila
water
mainly
through
compact
to
arizona,
colorado
and
california
and
nevada?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
that
there
--
well,
it's
--
i
think
maybe
a
little
more
complicated
than
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
but
it
indicates
one
--
in
any
case,
the
only
way
that
i
found
so
far
whereby
arizona
would
be
entitled
in
this
competition
to
all
the
waters
of
the
gila.
i
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
you
want
us
to
--
you
want
us
to
read
this
as
if
this
compact
–
three-state
compact
had
actually
been
executed.
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
under
your
construction,
arizona
would
get
as
much
as
it
would
if
this
three-state
compact
had
been
executed.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
section
4
(a)
talks
about
the
tributaries,
the
gila
below
the
river
--
below
the
dams
so,
what
you
just
said
is
just
not
literally
true.
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh
i
know
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
i
know
all
that.
but
i
mean,
when
you
look
at
section
4
of
the
project
act,
you
do
find
reference
to
these
tributaries
at
--
below
the
dam.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
think
we
--
this
court
operates
that
way
though.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
that's
the
question
we
have
to
decide?
justice
william
o.
douglas
[inaudible]
justice
william
o.
douglas
[inaudible]
4,400,000
feet
refers
to,
how
can
you
get
--
if
there's
a
justiciable
controversy?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
--
then
we
shouldn't
decide
anything
of
course.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
were
all
--
all
of
this
is
about
what
will
happen
in
the
future
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
this
project
is
extended,
if
the
population
increases
new
lands
come
in
under
irrigation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
you
were
--
if
you
were
the
engineer
--
if
you
were
the
engineer
to
design
a
new
extended
system
into
arizona
following
our
decision,
how
could
you
do
that
unless
you
knew
what
the
--
what
lands
were
to
be
served,
what
priorities
they
had,
whether
they
were
at
the
top
or
the
bottom
of
the
total
goal.
how
many
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
many
acre-feet
of
water
you
had
to
deal
with,
how
could
you
do
that?
you
couldn't,
could
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
could
then
sue
later
but
you
couldn't
without
comparing
the
whole
underpinning
of
the
project.
you'd
have
--
you'd
have
to
know
how
much
water
do
i
have,
what
lands
may
i
irrigate
with
--
where
to
put
the
[inaudible].
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
she
said
if
you
did,
you'd
have
another
lawsuit
on
your
hand.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
there's
no
conflict,
there
were
distributaries?
justice
william
o.
douglas
except
in
the
computation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
when
you
get
to
the
legislation,
you'll
find
that
only
on
the
contingency
that
a
new
price
state
compact
is
executed
--
california
is
that
true?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
you
can
find
on
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
don't
find
it
--
there
any
--
have
i
missed
any
other
thing
in
the
laws
themselves
that
touch
specifically
on
the
award
of
the
waters
of
the
gila
to
arizona?
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
you
follow
those
things
down,
i
suppose
you
can
find
almost
anything
in
this
legislative
history.i'm
so
confused.
but
when
you
follow
this
down
to
the
phipps'
amendment,
you
will
find
phipps
himself
saying,
as
i
recall,
that
those
--
that
4.4
million
acre-feet
is
out
of
system
waters
this
is
what
he
said.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
federal
distillation
would
be
what
a
future
secretary
or
the
present
secretary
might
decide
upon.
how
can
you
tell?
justice
william
o.
douglas
there's
no
federal
law
of
water
in
this
field.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
that
is
quite
right,
mr.
solicitor
general
in
my
state
of
washington.
what
you
say
is
true
but
it
is
also
true
that
once
a
right
is
perfected,
the
water
right
is
marketable
there
and
very
often
been
sold
and
then
applied
to
different
land.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
went
so
far
as
the
--
well,
we
don't
know.
if
you
were
an
engineer
and
you
were
going
to
design
this
new
arizona
project,
wouldn't
you
have
to
know
something
about
where
the
water
rights
were?
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
whether
or
not
his
decision
is
to
how
the
water
will
be
used
in
arizona
would
be
consistent
with
the
claims
of
arizona
landowners.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
aren't
you
to
that
point?
mustn't
you
got
to
that
point
before
you
setup
your
irrigation
system?
how
could
you,
as
an
engineer,
design
it
unless
you
know
what
land
was
to
be
served?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
would
know
what
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
now
let's
assume
it's
the
other
answer.
if
the
secretary
can
decide
it
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
then
of
course
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
state
law
governs
then
you
have
a
quite
different
considerate
problem.
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
do
you
explain
the
incorporation
of
the
provisions
of
the
reclamation
law?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
both
of
them
pair
on
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
we
rule
quite
contrary
in
the
nebraska
and
wyoming.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
applied
it
specifically
to
interstate
priorities
in
that
case.
we
didn't
say
it
--
we
didn't
say
that
it
was
an
absolute
rule
but
we
say
that
absent
to
other
consideration
that
was
to
govern.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you're
one
of
the
members
of
a
long
distinguished
line
of
solicitor
generals
who
has
argued
the
same
position
over
the
years,
trying
to
get
the
water
rights
in
the
hands
of
the
federal
agent
rather
than
state
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
not
saying
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
not
saying
we're
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
not
saying
that
you're
wrong
and
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
all
democrats
and
all
republicans
doesn't
include
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
especially
to
water
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
the
water?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
i
suppose
we've
decided
the
question
if
we
decide
it's
right.
