justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
--
what
do
you
use
now,
5.1,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
in
necessity
from
your
point
of
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
how
you
will
supply
the
deficit
if
the
upper
basin
uses
its
appropriate
share?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
in
--
what
would
happen
to
the
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
law
intend
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
imagine
that
enterprises
in
california
would
let
them
go
without
water.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
apart
from
the
master's
repu
--
report
or
conclusions,
you
have
a
deficit
just
in
the
upper
basin
if
they
use
they're
appropriate
share.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
almost
have
thrown
up
your
hands
in
answer
to
my
question
what
you're
going
to
do
for
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
all
the
potential
projects
of
arizona
require
congressional
approval
or
executive
approval?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
contingency
which
you
fear
is
dependent
upon
congressional
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
issue
is
left?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except,
they
are
not
reciprocal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
to
be
7.5.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
this
is
in
the
realm
of
the
speculation
fundamentally,
namely,
the
speculation
about
the
(inaudible).
so,
we
could
have
a
more
important
speculation
between
the
findings
and
then
draw
it
from
the
circumstances.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
do
you
say
when
the
colorado
river
compact
had
15
million
acre-feet,
exactly
what
appeared
to
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
the
5.1
is
drawn
from
the
tributaries?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
use
now
5.1.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
drawn
from
the
tributaries?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
brought
the
map
in
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
read
the
compact
of
how
much
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
does
not
quantify
the
generosity
upon
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ely,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
too
much
of
the
limitation
act
do
environment
meets
the
requirement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suggest
that
the
compact
adhere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ely,
is
there
a
great
big
difference
in
meaning.
no
quality
interpretation
has
explained
it
and
the
court
at
least
who
adjudicated
this
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
might
even
say
this
has
not
been
indicated
for
30
years
until
it
changes
for
the
master.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
that's
the
contention
that
your
argument
is
supposed
to
indicate
but
is
bound
by
the
social
conflict
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
that
what
he
brought
here?
he
might
have
written
a
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ely,
may
i
ask
of
you
about
the
judgment
of
the
jury,
i
can
bring
you
any
prejudice
of
the
jurisdiction,
starting
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
fact
of
this
litigation.
by
litigation,
i
mean
consider
the
attempt
to
(inaudible).
are
you
saying
that
(inaudible)
concluded
a
legal
appeal
doctrine
that
was
involved,
he
had
rejected
an
unconditional
doctrine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
it
--
can
the
court
mean
(inaudible)
not
been
involved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
you
at
--
you'd
take
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
effect,
(inaudible)
she
has
agreed
(inaudible)
that
she
wanted
to
involve
the
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact,
it's
there,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible).
he
pretty
much
exercised
the
conviction
in
a
desperate
(inaudible)
if
the
plea
was
entered
to
recognize
the
cause
and
he
insisted
that
he
couldn't
use
what
the
(inaudible)
exact
way
to
do
it
with
contention
to
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
justice
black's
question
become
circling
in
cases
where
there
was
planning
in
tributaries
in
the
lower
basin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
it's
been
briefed
--
it's
been
briefed.
could
you
please
answer
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
something
that
the
rule
does
not
require?
the
rule
is
not
--
they're
not
part
of
the
exhibit
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
not
the
real
question
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
it's
a
(inaudible)
if
you
have
a
group
of
waters
that
bind
the
state,
or
so
put
it,
then
you
have
no
problems
with
reference
to
the
upper
basin,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
mind
is
very
in
eagerness
to
get
your
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry,
where
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
118?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
you
say
that
gauges
were
introduced
at
lee
ferry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
the
big
thing
is
that,
even
after
that,
the
figures
differ
between
the
historic
flow
and
the
virgin
flow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i've
--
my
question
and
my
ignorance
is
why
should
they
estimate
after
they
had
meet
and
measured
it
accurately?
justice
felix
frankfurter
clear
up
some
more
on
my
part.
what
do
you
gauge
if
it's
imaginary?
what
imaginary
figure
the
gauge
has
gauged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
still
troubled.
i
don't
understand
what
you
measure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
measure
the
imaginary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
basis
of
the
objectivity
and--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
after
we've
had
the
figures
of
the
exposition
in
your
part,
is
it
true
that
all
this
is
irrelevant
to
the
problem
we
have
to
face
on
your
--
on
the
basis
of
your
argument
that,
in
any
event
--
in
any
event,
what
goes
through
--
what
gets
to
the
lower
basin
is
unaffected
by
what
the
upper
basin
may
get
out
of
its
hypothetical
or
out
of
this
abstract
seven
million
fund?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
was
--
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question
is
we
needn't
bother
about
these
figures,
whatever
may
be
the
differences,
the
fact
is
that
7,500,000
is
merely
an
unreal
ceiling
for
the
upper
basin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
uphold
justice
black's
question.
the
answer
that
you
give,
we
can
forget
all
about
the
upper
basin,
there's
no
bearing
to
the
--
on
the
controversy.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
that's
your
essential
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
subject
to
that
lawyer's
reserve,
do
you
speak
for
all
the
parties
when
you
said
that's
your
position,
the
upper
basin
--
the
waters
of
the
upper
basin
is
unrelated
to
our
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i
mean,
from
what
--
from
what
their
position
as
known
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
have
you
speak
for
them,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
understand
that
but,
as
far
as
you
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
part
of
your
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
understand
that,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
i
know
but,
in
all
event,
they
wouldn't
have
to
be
--
they
wouldn't
be
expanded,
would
they?
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
basics
of
your
argument
that
the
relation,
the
interest
of
the
upper
basin
states
on
the
water
from
colorado
are
not
relevant
--
is
not
a
relevant
problem
for
the
disposition
of
this
case
by
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
is,
then,
from
my
point
of
view,
we're
in
trouble.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
--
you
are
then
adjudicating
rights
that
aren't
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
got
a
limitation
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
comes
down?

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
doing
is
demand
side
the
--
the
literal
terms
of
the
language,
you
say,
in
this
case
they're
not
qualified,
as
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
whatever
congress
said
but
if
congress
used
the
term,
you
have
to
define
it.
you'd
have
to
the
pause
a
meaning
into
the
word,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
disregard
the
word
in
pouring
in
the
meaning
into
the
word,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
from
saying
just
--
(inaudible)
in
all
the
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you
--
you've
quoted
justice
holmes
but
no
one
is
more
frequent
than
he
said
intention
of
congress
is
derived
from
the
word
it
used.
what
the
words
mean
is
a
different
story,
but
it
seems
to
me
a
bit
of
cavalier
just
to
start
on
an
argument
by
saying
we
disregard
the
word
altogether.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
--
but
it's
a
different
thing
from
saying
you
disregard
that,
what
you're
saying
is
it's
because
of
the
(inaudible)
statute
if
in
congressional
english,
this
is
what
those
words
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pay
no
attention
to
the
word
and
go
on
because
you're
talking
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
(inaudible)
all
around
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
would
call
it
contention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
out
of
this
full
of
water.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
we
know
what
(inaudible),
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
after
you
make
the
division
of
the
ice
cream,
divide
it
between
two
--
between
two
parties
then
of
course
those
within
one
half
of
the
division
or
whatever
you're
talking
about
have
no
interest
in
the
other
half.
but
in
the
original
division
--
the
original
(inaudible)
derived
from
the
interest
in
this
what
you
call
a
common
treasure
and
that
to
say
in
controversy
within
the
lower
basin,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
--
if
i
understood,
it
remained
constitutional
argument,
i
must
have
missed
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
i
--
if
we
recall
that
the
he
invoked
the
commerce
clause
that
compelling
or
prohibiting
this
or
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
were
the
essence
of
the
litigation
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
first
arizona
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
raising
else,
it
was
subordinate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
subordinate
but
almost
disregard
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think
that
they
even
started
from
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
i
may
say
so,
is
more
convenient
to
my
ear.
you
don't
construe
it
black
and
white
on
a
piece
of
paper
rather
than
saying
that
the
compact
is
irrelevant.
that
doesn't
mean
much
to
me
considering
the
fact
that
the
act
which
is
to
be
construed
refers
to
the
compact.
i
don't
know
how
many
times
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
has
to
say
irrelevant
means
that
you
--
that
--
that
a
special
meaning
has
to
be
given
to
the
reference
in
the
project
act
not
with
the
compact
which
preceded
it
as
irrelevant
because
it's
in
there,
in
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
even
the
master
says
that
i
don't
know
what
that
means
to
say
it's
irrelevant
on
part
of
the
statute
which
you
construed
makes
a
reference
to
that.
i
don't
understand,
i
know
those
evidently
and
constantly
told
this
is
semantics,
but
that's
what
all
law
is
about.
law
is
about
words
or
rather
conveyed
by
word,
therefore,
we
should
say
things
that
just
verbal.
that's
the
--
that's
what
all
business
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
rather
that
the
reference
in
the
project
act
requires
a
construction
about
the
--
or
what
the
scope
of
the
compact
is
with
a
reference
to
the
act
and
not
with
reference
to
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
crucial
to
your
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
it
is
to
mr.
ely's
case,
namely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
legislative
history
insofar
as
authority
is
preceding
discussions
in
the
congress
are
relevant
no
more
than
constructions.
that's
crucial
to
this
case,
isn't
it?

claim
is
essential
to
their
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
mining
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
naval
reserve,
that
might
be
my
question.
naval
withdraw
for
use
of
material
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you,
just
out
of
curiosity,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
government
cannot
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
a
tribe
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
reach
the
position
of
what
you're
now
addressing
yourself,
who
is
going
to
be
making
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
relation
of
these
mean
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
couldn't
be
allowed
in
the
question
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
population
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
issue
whether
this
is
a
matter
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
matter
merely
of
what's
the
total
million
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
--
these
figures
or
all
these
reservations
of
rights
on
certain
people
who's
come
in
are
not
protected.
they're
not
(inaudible)
from
the
quantity
of
the
reservations,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
comfortably,
potential
frequent
use
(inaudible)
what
is
available
for
arizona
to
use.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
pictorial
tour
you're
making.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
that
problem
arises.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
because,
in
setting
aside
those
lands
as
reservations,
executive
officials,
the
executive
department
of
the
government
is
carrying
out
a
policy
to
authorize
explicitly
or
implicitly
by
act
of
congress.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
you
could
--
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can't,
out
of
his
own
free
will,
determine
what
shall
be
indian
reservation,
except
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
insofar
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
fund
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
except
insofar
as
his
authority
is
implied
from
general
legislation
regarding
the
duties
of
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
get
on
that.
he
can't
--
he
isn't
--
he
isn't
(inaudible)
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
doesn't
flow
from
his
own
will,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
meant
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
especially
implied
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
doesn't
--
again,
he
doesn't
operate
by
virtue
of
his
own
will.
he
has
delegated
authority.
the
delegation
that's
made
may
be
found
either
by
explicit
name
provisions
or
from
other
authorizing
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
reservation,
the
establishment
of
reservation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
land
itself
is
derived
from
some
granted
authority
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
so
ever
the
grant
is
established.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
and
the
master
do
not
disagree
on
the
applicable
legal
principles
and
the
issue
between
you
gets
down
to
whether
or
not
the
circumstances
on
which
the
master
drew
allowing
him
--
allowed
him
to
refer
to
the
use
or
incur
the
intent
which
the
legal
principle
which
you
invoke
requires,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
difference
in
application
but
would
there
be
difference
beyond
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
deny
that
it
can
be
found
through
implications.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
whole
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
issue
is
as
to
what
the
circumstances,
summarized
by
the
master,
allow
inference
from,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
and
--
but
you
and
the
master
move
in
a
different
circle.
your
circle
is
that
there
was
enough
water
at
that
time.
ergo,
no
reservation
of
additional
water
is
desired.
the
master
said
what
was
reserved
at
that
time
is
their
right
to
be
an
agricultural
community
and
whatever
is
involved
in
being
such
a
community.
and,
therefore,
when
the
water
was
no
longer
in
abundance,
what
was
necessarily
implied
was
that
they
should
have
some
other
water
that's
stackable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
not
for
the
future.
with
reference
to
waters
that
function
to
the
land
there
and
what
the
master
is
saying
that
you
have
to
have
water
and,
therefore,
there's
the
reservation
or
whatever
potential
needs
of
getting
that
water
was
available
to
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
saying,
now,
there
isn't
that
abundance
of
water.
it
doesn't
come
to
them
that
way,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
foresight
was
that
they
should
be
a
--
what
is
said
just
a
minute
ago,
called
a
viable
agricultural
community.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
suggest
that
you're
viewing
some
hindsight
now?
can
it
be
that
in
--
are
you
suggesting
that,
in
the
60's,
the
thought
was
that
the
indians
would
be
absorbed
in
the
general
mass
of
the
population
of
this
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wouldn't
allow
today
if
this
whole
thought
received
currency
among
appropriate
men,
but
that
to
me
has
answered
the
real
solution
or
the
real
adequate
source
of
the
indian
if
they
should
become
merged
within
the
mass
of
our
population.
am
i
wrong
about
that,
mr.
reed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
last
--
whatever
is
entered
into
what
it
is.
even
then,
there
was
strong
resistance
with
their
own
qualities.
their
own
specialized
life
should
not
be
diluted
by
being
having
them
absorbed
in
the
general
life
of
the
american
community.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
you
prefer
you
give
gila's,
arizona
of

part
of

on
the
basis
of
a
different
(inaudible)
justice

in
other
words
that's
the
(voice

--
justice

frankfurter
does
your
view
(inaudible)
there
is
difference
(inaudible)
of
the
significant
with
contrary
to
legislative
history
of
the
treatment
so
called
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
thing
required
to
be
--
that's
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
their
duty
to
--
if
the
motion
on
the
secretary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

not
that
he
may
--
the
power
but
he
must.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
power
can
give
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
state
may
choose
to
be
to
consider
(inaudible)
justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix

what
--
couldn't
you
tell
us
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
combining
essential
use
(inaudible)
regarding
the
dependant
grounds
of
the
distance
of
the
1,000,000
acre-feet.
justice

do
you
think
that
if
you
reject
the
first

justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what's
about
the
two,
first
one
is
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
lower
court,
the
lower
court
that
constantly
confronts
to
invest
water,
lower
court
that
constantly
confronts
(inaudible)
justice

after
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
beside,
wouldn't
you
mind
define
the
orthodoxies
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
look
at
the
state
law,
there
might
be
a
difference
in
view
that
it
is
important
(inaudible)
that,
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
can
you
(inaudible)
the
relationship
between
the
power
of
the
secretary
grant
licensees
(inaudible)
enter
relationship
those
two
in
connection
with
the
utterance
relevant
to
state
law
that
was
enacted
by
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
there
--
hence
the
water
right,
there
were
three
(inaudible)
claims
upon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
up
to
--
yeah.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
after
elected
use
of
the
water,
the
one
who
(inaudible)
made
to
be
creative
but
there
may
had
been
some
--
some
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
(inaudible)
tomorrow,
the
discussion
in
(inaudible)
important
right,
and
present
perfected
rights,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
(inaudible)
debate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
better
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
(inaudible)
but
i
just
like
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
wonder
whether
this
is
a
new
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on.
are
you
finished?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on,
i
actually
have
a
question
(inaudible)
as
i
understood
you,
you
said
that
all
the
western
states
are
in
agreement
regarding
perfected
rights.
if
one
is
perfected,
that
they
relate
back
to
the
original
notice
of
claims,
didn't
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
is
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
essentially,
if
that
is
so,
is
that
doctrine
of
relation-back
could
be
read
into
present
perfected
right
in
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
word
“present.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
what
--
is
there
any
authority
except
the
appealing
reasoning
from
the
word
“present?”
is
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
light
that's
shed
except
the
addition
of
that
adjective?
because,
according
to
--
i
misun
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
misunderstand.
according
to
western
water
rights
notions,
once
it
is
perfected
in
the
way
it
is
required,
it
becomes
a
present
perfected
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
is
making
the
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
hang
on
that
word
“present”,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
you
can
--
it
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
carry
it,
it
can't
waive
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
take
an
interest
in
legal
consequence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
if
each
is
by
contract,
getting
more
water
than
if
involved
in
just
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
meaning
that
the
existing
the
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
bearing
on
the
omission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
no
issues
but
this
issue
--
may
i
just
say
something.
are
you
going
to
suggest
--
are
you
suggesting
it's
a
matter
where
there's
enough
left
in
this
litigation
to
leave
it
open,
keep
the
communication
open
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
huge
burden
upon
it
to
keep
it
open
as
you
have
this
master
forum
below,
then
go
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
being
--
is
that
--
is
that
true,
is
that
true,
with
respect
to
all
completeness,
you
need
not
be
in
progress
now
(inaudible)
that
you'd
all
wait
in
getting
the
future
conflicts
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
that
extent,
he
wouldn't
even
deny
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
way
just
so
i
could
put
my
foot
in,
just
to
make
clear
your
argument.
you
will
come
back
to
the
power
problem
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
now
but
before
you
get
through.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
state
of
that
project?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
title
of
it
is
boulder
canyon
project?
justice
felix

if
you
want,
you
could
present
that
right
now.

you're
saying
that

regarding

justice

and
therefore,
the

you
mean
that

attached
to
it
as
well
as
