justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
not
the
only
source,
is
it,
of
water
for
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
just
--
do
i
understand
--
isn't
there
some
state
project
in
effect
in
northern
california
for
turning
rivers
around
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
water
to
southern
california?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
well,
just
a
matter
of
curiosity,
is
that
to
supply
water
to
the
area
served
by
the
metropolitan
water
district
in
substitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
ely,
you
said
we
have
a
reprint
copy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
morning?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me.
there
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
no
longer
an
issue
in
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
my
point
was,
as
i
understood
the
brief,
arizona
no
longer
quarrels
with
you
as
to
your
right
to
share
half
of
that
extra
million
between
the
water.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i'm
not
wrong
about
that,
am
i?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
a
practical
consequence
during
this
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
didn't
actually
go
through
to
the
extent
that
it
had
been
depleted
before
it
got
there,
but
you
can
arrive
at
what
had
been
depleted
before
it
got
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
this
might
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
agree.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
content
that
the
master
(inaudible)
namely
the
reference
to
3
(a)
is
just
a
short
hand
that
way
of
saying
the
first
7,500,000
feet,
do
you
agree
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
is
yours
different
from
him
in
that
respect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
specifically
in
the
context
of
the
project
act,
you
do
agree
with
the
master
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
reference
to
3
(a)
is
just
shorthand
for
the
first
7,500,000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
the
meaning
of
the
reference
in
the
project
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry
mr.
wilmer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
seem
to
--
clear
about
just
what
your
position
is
as
to
the
reference
in
4
(a)
in
the
project
act
to
3
(a)
in
the
compact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
want
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
then,
well,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what's
under
the
diversion
--
the
status
of
diversion
between
the
lake
and
lee
ferry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
your
view
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
--
does
that
add
up
to
this
--
that
all
the
secretary
can
do
is
contract
in
respect
to
the
water
which
actually
gets
to
the
lake
only
has
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
if
anything
else
needs
to
be
done
or
rather
if
anything
maybe
done
through
the
water
between
lee
ferry
and
the
lake
this
requires
--
as
i
say
suggest
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
water
plus
further
congressional
approval,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
what
the
--
the
master
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
above
what?
above
lee
ferry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
above
the
lake
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
below
lee
ferry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
is
that
--
is
that
your
--
i
didn't
i
understand
your
pleadings
correctly,
but
i
believe
not
just
today,
he
was
talking
of
project
of
which
canyon
and
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
answer
is,
that
you
couldn't
do
those
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
wilmer,
what
--
what
does
that
mean
in
the
event
there's
enough
water
to
have
7,500,000
feet
in
the
upper
basin
and
at
the
same
time
deliver
at
least
30
of
the
amount
that
they're
obligated
under
the
compact
delivery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
if
--
if
in
discharging
that
obligation
that
leads
them
with
less
than
that
in
the
upper
basin,
they
accept
the
deficiency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
black.

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
page
67
of
your
legislative
history.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
--
what
--
i
don't
quite
understand
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
theory
of
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
title
of
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
project.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
wilmer,
if
--
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you're
right
and
we
interpret
the
statute
your
way
which
supports
the
master
and
the
rate
of
(inaudible)
develops
that
had
been
told
may
very
well
with
growing
industry
and
everything
else,
is
this
going
--
the
next
time
you
have
problems
for
us
or
for
the
congress?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
how
can
it
get
back
here
afterwards,
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
should
be
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
should
have
followed
you
when
you
opened.
are
you
speaking
now
only
of
united
states
claims
in
the
lower
basin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
arizona?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
are
you
going
to
identify
for
us
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
location?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
you've
withdrawn
for
special
uses
of
parts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
one
was
that
down
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
reservation
entered
the
state
route?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
that
one
must
have
given
with
ignorance,
at
least
in
nevada,
than
you
have
in
the
west.
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
i
think
you
showed
us
that,
on
the
colorado
indian's
reservation,
an
actual
diversion
of
770,000
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
acre-feet
is
necessary
to
realize
half
that
--
amount
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
irrigation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
i
see
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
will
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
--
was
what
you
just
said
mean
that
the
actual
demand
on
the
river
comes
down
to
330,000
because
whether
it
diverts
770
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
a
return
which
gives
you
a
net
of
330,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
means
that's
only
a
potential
for
that
family
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
that's
actually
being
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
being
withdrawn
from
the
river.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
probably
responsible
for
some
of
this,
mr.
reed,
but
i
am
confused.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
example,
on
this
mohave
--
is
that
the
one
you
were
talking
about,
the
one
where
there's
nothing
used
now?
now
that
water
comes
past,
obviously,
doesn't
it,
because
it's
not
being
used,
is
that
true?
it
goes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
right
past
the
reservation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right
through
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
none
of
it
is
being
used
or
diverted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
i
gather,
until
it's
actually
used
or
diverted,
in
connection
with
rights
which
the
master's
found
the
indians
there
have,
it
then
becomes
available
for
apportionment
below,
doesn't
it,
to
arizona
or
california
and
anyone
else,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
my
point
is
that,
at
the
moment
at
least,
arizona
is
losing
nothing
in
the
way
of
actual
water
by
reason
what
the
master
has
found
to
be
the
condition
as
regards
to
that
reservation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
what
you
were
about
to
say
that
you
have
to
be
able
to
count
on
it
because
it
involves
a
capital
expenditures
of
some
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
substantial
dimensions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
on
the
gila
river?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
would
that
benefit
from
the
central
arizona
water
project?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
of
the
non-indian
is
50,000
acres?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
of
the
non-indian
is
50,000
acres
are
being
upon?
you
said
only
half
or
less
than
half
of
the
indian
is
50,000
acres.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
solicitor,
i
gather
in
the
stretch
above
mead
up
to
lee
ferry.
do
you
think
the
secretary
has
contract
powers
to
divert
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
before
the
water
get
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
would
the
same
thing
be
true
to
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
into
the
lake?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
into
the
lake,
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
quite
of
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
i
still
don't
think
i'm
clear
about
your
position
as
to
that
secretary's
power
of
contract
in
respect
to
diversion
before
water
gets
to
lake
mead
after
this
differ.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
charge
it
against
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
california's
based?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
the
(voice
overlap)
actually
was
being
taken.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they're
actually
using
the
water.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
makes
it
perfected
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
utah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
after
all,
this
was
california
and
nevada's
proposal
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
is
not
the
arizona's
liking
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
in
1925?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
27.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
(inaudible)
the
second
paragraph?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
senator
bratton?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
told
me
what
you
needed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
changing
your
answer
to
me?
you
said
that
that
wasn't
necessary
to
decide.
now,
you
say
it
has
to
be
decided.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
intrastate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
intrastate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
phase?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
what
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hartley.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
takes
the
position
now,
of
course,
that's
invalid,
in
excess
of
the
secretary's
power.
was
there
any
animation
of
that
at
the
time
the
compact
was
made
with
the
nevada
agency
that
the
government
believed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
those
two
are
amended
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
really
--
if
my
memory
serves
me
at
all,
i
thought
something
with
an
agreement
last
year
that
the
central
arizona
project
is
in
limbo
because
the
inability
to
get
any
financing
until
these
problems
are
solved,
am
i
wrong
about
that
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
prior
to
1929?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
state
could
require
the
secretary
the
contract
with
your
state
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
he
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
what
--
i
think
what
has
been
accorded
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
this
apply
also
to
california
and
arizona?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
arizona?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
spell
this
out
of
the
history
and
--
