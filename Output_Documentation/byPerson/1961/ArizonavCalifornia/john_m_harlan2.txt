justice
john
m.
harlan
if
it
becomes
necessary
to
exclude
the
compact,
how
could
we
do
that
with
the
absence
of
all
the
upper
basin
states?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then,
by
one
of
those
durations,
it's
difficult
reaching
the
conclusion
there,
but
he
ends
up
by
saying
the
compact
is
irrelevant
for
the
purposes
of
this
litigation.
if
he's
rights
then,
of
course,
the
absence
of
the
upper
basin
states
is
not
important.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
clear
i
take
it
that
what
california
was
assigned
to
was
to
satisfy
the
requirements,
addition
or
whatever
you
use
to
call
it,
this
project
act
that
it's
passed
its
limitation
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
i
would
suppose
that
the
crucial
question
is
now
what
california
was
thought
it
was
doing,
but
what
congress
intended
california
to
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
terms
--
in
terms
with
california
is
intended
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
in
section
1?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
have
comprehended
however
the
portion
of
the
mainstream
that
is
referred
to
between
lee's
ferry
and
then
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
do
you
disagree
with
the
master's
(inaudible)
you
construed
into
that
water
in
california
litigation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
with
that
4,600,000,
you
mean
all
water
below
lee
ferry?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
below
lake
mead?
justice
john
m.
harlan
insofar
as
the
limitation
is
concerned,
the
point
you've
arrived,
there's
no
distinction
between
--
there's
no
diminution
of
the
california
limitation
or
the
california
rights
to
back
the
fact
that
the
water
between
lake
mead
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
the
limitation
with
respect
of
lake
mead
and
all
water
in
the
mainstream
below
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that's
the
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
just
--
just
to
demonstrate
it,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
legislative
history
completely
and
unequivocally
demonstrates
that
congress
was
disposing
of
the
water
and
was
dividing
the
water.
california
has
made
the
assertion
that
no
senator
contended
that
they
were
dividing
the
water.
that
there
were
no
contention
that
they
are
dividing
the
water.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wonder
if
one
of
your
associates
could
pinpoint
this
in
the
legislative
history
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean,
could
you
--
could
he
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
do
it
now
(inaudible)
never
--
if
--
if
he
can't,
alright,
i'll
--
don't
--
don't
slow
up
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
certainly
on
the
legislative
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it's
cited
in
our
--
cited
in
our
own
brief
or
to
them
with
reference
with
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh
i
thought
--
i
thought
maybe
i'm
--
briefly
misunderstood
the
argument,
too.
i
thought
there
were
two
facets
to
california's
position.
one,
that
the
california
limitation
related
to
a
system-wide
water
are
not
merely
mainstream
water.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore
if
they
were
right
on
that
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
contractual
method
of
allocation
and
what
now
would
disappear
from
the
case
because
there
will
be
plenty
of
water
around
for
everybody.
then
i
thought
their
second
string
was
that
if
they
were
wrong
on
the
system-wide
aspect
of
it
and
their
rights
were
conferred
to
mainstream
water
then
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
there
was
a
contractual
allocations
so-called
as
distinguished
from
--
as
applied
to
shortages
at
least
the
application
in
the
conventional
water
right
rules
of
prior
appropriation
and
that
could've
been
apportioned.
i
thought
there
were
two
strings
to
that
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
leads
me
to
ask
you
another
question,
supposing
that
the
second
string
to
their
bow
is
taken,
what
would
use
namely
that
their
--
that
you're
right
as
far
as
the
limitation
of
being
--
to
the
mainstream
is
concerned,
tributaries
are
out.
and
that
their
right
as
to
the
question
of
there
being
no
contractual
allocations
so-called
in
those
circumstances,
what
would
you
say
would
be
the
desirability
or
the
necessity
of
sending
it
back
for
further
proceedings
on
that
the
defendant
supplies.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
then
that's
begging
the
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
concede
there's
any
possibility,
any
conceivable
possibility
that
california
might
be
right
in
any
part
of
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
(inaudible)
by
hypothesis
the
california
argument
on
this
date
is
that
the
project
act
properly
construed
would
mean
that
in
the
allocation
of
the
water
in
the
absence
of
a
statutory
or
a
contractual
secretarial
allocation
that
the
project
act
properly
construed
meant
that
congress
intended
that
the
water
should
be
distributed
in
accordance
with
conventional
water
right
of
law.
that's
the
argument
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
would
--
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
my
question
is
directed
to
that
because
unless
i
had
misinterpreted
that
argument,
that's
one
facet
of
the
--
their
basic
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
answer
to
that
is
that
we'd
have
to
go
back.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
to
turn
around
the
other
way,
in
other
words,
the
only
premise
on
which
this
case
could
be
finally
disposed
of
up
here
is
on
the
acceptance
of
the
master's
contractual
arrangement
allocation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
--
or
that
it's
just
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
statutory
formula.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
independent
whether
the
california
limitation
is
mainstream
or
tributary.
justice
john
m.
harlan
just
to
take
the
edge
of
their
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
first
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
this
question?
does
the
united
states
agree
with
arizona's
position
that
there
was
a
statutory
allocation
by
virtue
of
the
project
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
could
go
a
little
under
or
little
above.
justice
john
m.
harlan
subject
to
the
calif
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
he
was
bound
by
the
california
limitation
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
4.4?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
said
7.5.
justice
john
m.
harlan
with
that
respect,
you're
in
an
agreement
with
mr.
wilmer's
position
in
colloquy
in
the
court
yesterday?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
view
being
the
latter?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
so
you
mean
consideration.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
mind
indicating
roughly
where
black
canyon
is.
i
can't
find
it
on
the
map
that
i'm
seeing
this
(inaudible)
so
far.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
i
was
wondering.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood
mr.
ely
draw
a
distinction
between
perfected
rights
under
the
contract
and
prior
appropriated
rights
under
california
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
(voice
overlap)
is
up
on
a
question
as
to
whether
that's
the
exclusive
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
it
doesn't
foreclose
the
argument,
there's
no
allocation
here,
federal
allocation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
deal
with
the
legislative
history
of
how
that
clause
got
into
the
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
proposal
of
course
looked
towards
a
disposition
of
the
lower
basin
water
in
terms
of
an
interstate
compact.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
(inaudible)
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
some
of
it
is
but
all
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
can
have
it
citation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
the
change
over
from
a
proposed
requirement,
a
factual
requirement
of
two
states
to
a
permissive
requirement
has
any
barring
on
the
contractual
sectoral
allocation
of
area
domestic?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
may
be
a
fine
distinction
too,
but
still
it
didn't
take
the
form
of
compulsion,
did
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
(inaudible)
how
much
--
argue
when
that
blew
up
over
this
question
of
state
rights,
wasn't
it?
just
let
her
debate
on
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
unless
we
--
unless
we
come
--
unless
we
accept
the
california's
thesis
that
you
reject
on
the
limitation,
is
that
to
come
to
briefs
in
this
problem,
the
other
problem
on
a
much
broader
problem?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
not
14
and
18,
we've
got
to
decide
whether
it
contracts
your
allocation
or
state
law
governed
to
the
allocation
of
this
water?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
exhibit
number?
would
you
give
me
the
document
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
of
course,
they
will
be
subject
to
your
proving
your
priorities
if
they
request
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
necessarily
in
this
lawsuit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
theory
of
priorities,
what
room
is
left
for
the
play
of
the
--
of
present
protective
right
of
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
what
would
--
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
how
would
it
apply?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
was
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
the
question
i
intend
to
convey
by
my
earlier
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
namely,
if
you're
theory
of
priorities
is
correct,
what
purpose
is
the
statutory
raised
present
protected
rights
served?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
want
to
ask
you.
there
is
an
area
above
--
this
accosted
you
to
suggest
justiciability
and
there's
an
area
above
lee
ferry
in
the
portion
of
the
arizona
border
that
lies
in
the
upper
basin.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
haven't
heard
any
discussion
as
to
the
prospects
of
arizona
being
able
to
satisfy
or
control
or
in
part
her
requirements
out
of
that
section
which
would
be
a
charge
not
against
the
lower
basin
but
against
the
upper
basin.
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
chargeable
there,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
your
argument
now
being
directed
to
the
nonjusticiability
of
this
whole
controversy?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
--
let
me
ask
you
the
direct
question.
do
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
--
is
there
any
disagreement
between
california
and
yourselves
that
is,
regards
your
particular
branch
of
the
case,
both
issues
are
properly
justiciable
and
should
be
--
should
be
decided?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
decision
that
you
think
ought
to
be
reached
but
do
you
think
both
questions
should
be
decided
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
john
m.
harlan
limitation
and
--
no,
limitation
and
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
federal
allocation
of
the
water
supply
as
against
apportionment
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
what
about
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
second
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
understand
your
position
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
california
does
not
argue
does
it
that
congress
doesn't
have
constitutional
power
to
allocate
this
water
--
i
mean,
[inaudible]
wishes
to
--
the
issue
is
whether
it
did
so
by
the
project
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
wrong
about
that?
i
don't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
understand
there's
any
constitutional
issue
in
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
basic
argument
as
i
get
it
is
that
the
project
act
was
intended
to
give
effect
to
the
denver
settlement
and
the
denver
settlement
clearly
exclude
--
dealt
only
with
the
main
river.
that's
what
it
all
comes
down
to.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes..
justice
john
m.
harlan
sorry.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is
also
true,
however,
that
the
congress
did
not
undertake
itself
to
make
an
allocation
of
water.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
significance
if
any
is
the
october
of
1963
going?
were
they
provided
for
further
equitable
--?
