mr.
stanley
mosk
i
shall
bear
that
in
mind,
mr.
justice
black.
if
i
may,
for
just
a
moment
until
this
diagram
is
placed
for
your
viewing.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
california
and
seven
public
agencies
of
california
are
before
this
court
as
defendants
in
a
suit
arizona
commenced
nearly
10
years
ago
over
rights
to
use
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system.
we're
defending
the
fourth
suit
arizona
has
brought
in
this
court
against
california.
in
terms
of
its
consequences,
this
is
the
most
important
suit
in
which
california
has
ever
engaged.
whatever
the
court's
decision,
the
outcome
will
deeply
affect
all
of
the
states
in
the
south
western
part
of
the
united
states.
more
waters
at
issue,
many
times
over,
that
in
all
of
the
previous
interstate
suits
which
this
court
has
heard
involving
western
interstate
water
rights.
arizona
initiated
this
suit
in
order
to
obtain
an
adjudicated
right
to
water
for
the
proposed
central
arizona
project,
a
reclamation
project
which
could
convey
water
from
the
main
colorado
river
to
irrigate
lands
in
the
phoenix
area.
in
arizona's
statement,
accompanying
her
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint,
arizona
alleged
the
contending
parties
assert
conflicting
claims
to
the
right
to
use
certain
quantities
of
colorado
river
system
water.
these
claims
are
mutually
exclusive.
as
to
each
quantity
of
water
involved,
a
recognition
of
the
arizona
claim
requires
a
denial
of
the
california
claim,
and
vice
versa.
now,
arizona's
statement
is
undeniably
accurate
in
that
respect.
this
litigation,
in
terms
of
its
results,
is
a
contest
which
will
decide,
if
it
decides
anything
at
all,
whether
the
water
now
being
used
by
existing
projects
in
california
is
to
be
taken
away
from
those
projects
for
new
projects
in
arizona
and
nevada.
now,
if
i
may,
let
me
briefly
describe
the
three
california
projects,
the
rights
of
which
are
at
issue
here.
this
map
behind
me
and
in
front
of
you
will
illustrate
the
location
of
these
projects.
first,
the
palo
verde
irrigation
district.
the
palo
verde
irrigation
district
is
located
on
the
colorado
river
about
212
miles
below
hoover
dam.
it
is
california's
oldest
project
with
water
rights
initiated
back
in
1877.
second,
the
all-american
canal
project.
that
canal
serves
the
defendants,
imperial
irrigation
district
and
coachella
valley
county
water
district,
and
also
that
portion
of
the
yuma
project
which
is
in
california
but
which
is
not
a
defendant
in
this
proceeding.
these
areas
are
located,
as
you
can
see
from
that
diagram,
in
the
south
east
and
central
part
of
california
immediately
north
of
the
international
boundary
with
mexico.
the
all-american
canal
replaced
a
diversion
canal
to
the
imperial
valley
which
began
service
back
in
1901
and
it
takes
its
name
from
the
fact
that
it
replaced
a
diversion
route
which
left
the
river
in
the
united
states
and
crossed
mexican
territory
on
its
way
to
imperial
valley.
and,
third,
the
metropolitan
water
district
of
southern
california.
metropolitan
built
and
maintains
the
colorado
river
aqueduct
which
diverts
water
form
the
colorado
river
at
parker
dam,
transports
that
water
242
miles
over
and
through
the
mountain
range
which
separates
the
great
cities
on
the
coast
from
the
colorado
river.
metropolitan's
colorado
river
aqueduct
supplies
the
defendant
city
of
los
angeles,
the
defendant
city
of
san
diego
and
nearly
90
other
cities
which
are
not
named
as
defendants
by
arizona.
mr.
stanley
mosk
yes,
all
from
the
colorado,
and
it's
transported
this
242
miles
through
the
aqueduct.
mr.
stanley
mosk
well,
that's
the
only
source
of
water
for
the
colorado
river
aqueduct
which
is
--
which
supplies
the
metropolitan
water
district
of
southern
california.
mr.
stanley
mosk
no.
mr.
stanley
mosk
i'm
going
right
back,
mr.
douglas.
mr.
stanley
mosk
yes,
we
will
--
mr.
stanley
mosk
we'll
have
that
figure
for
you,
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
cost
of
this
entire
project
of
the
colorado
river
aqueduct
was
over
a
half
a
billion
dollars
and,
i
might
add,
these
were
depression-sized
dollars.
this
colorado
river
aqueduct
was
initiated
almost
40
years
ago.
it's
been
in
service
now
for
over
20
years,
yet,
even
with
that
initiation
20
years
ago,
it's
still
california's
newest
colorado
river
project.
under
the
law
of
california
which,
in
this
respect,
is
identical
to
the
law
of
prior
appropriation
of
the
other
western
states.
metropolitan's
rights
are
due
here
to
the
rights
of
california's
two
great
agricultural
projects
which
were
earlier
initiated.
hence,
metropolitan
would
feel
the
brunt
of
the
master's
decision.
the
demonstrable
effect
of
that
decision
is
to
wipe
out
metropolitan's
entire
colorado
river
supply
whenever
the
limitation
imposed
on
the
lower
basin
by
the
colorado
river
compact
is
enforced.
under
the
master's
recommended
decree,
there
is
not
water
at
all
for
this
great
project
unless
there
is
available
to
the
lower
basin
very
substantially
more
than
the
8.5
million
acre-feet
of
water
per
year
which
the
colorado
river
compact
specifies
for
use
in
the
lower
basin.
quite
naturally
--
mr.
stanley
mosk
--
this
con
--
mr.
stanley
mosk
yes,
that
is
correct.
they
have
priority.
mr.
stanley
mosk
these
two
projects
have
priority.
well,
--
mr.
stanley
mosk
well,
it
is
--
under
the
master's
recommendation,
as
we
see
it
--
mr.
stanley
mosk
california
gets
45
--
44/75
of
the
first
seven-and-a
half
million
acre-feet
available
not
from
the
stream
and
the
tributaries
--
mr.
stanley
mosk
but
from
the
congregated
mainstream
alone.
mr.
stanley
mosk
from
lake
mead
down
to
the
mexican
boundary.
mr.
stanley
mosk
now,
this
means
44/75
times
6
million
or
about
3.5
million
acre-feet.
3.8
--
mr.
stanley
mosk
well,
6
million
is
in
the
lower
stream,
2
million
in
the
tribute
--
tributaries
according
to
our
evidence.
mr.
stanley
mosk
no,
they
are
not
but
that
leaves
3.5
million
acre-feet
according
to
our
calculations.
3.85
is
used
by
the
prior
users
before
metropolitan
gets
a
single
drop
of
water.
mr.
stanley
mosk
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
mosk
that
is
correct.
that
leaves
nothing
whatever
for
metropolitan
--
mr.
stanley
mosk
--
under
this
--
mr.
stanley
mosk
under
this
evidence.
now
quite
naturally,
this
consequence
is
rather
frightening
to
the
seven
million
californians
who
depend
on
colorado
river
water.
between
1950
and
1960,
the
population
in
the
southern
california
area
served
by
colorado
river
water,
just
the
increase
alone
in
that
one
decade,
was
nearly
3,200,000
persons.
that
increase
alone
is
double
the
entire
population
of
arizona
and
nevada
combined
in
1960.
mr.
stanley
mosk
percentage-wise,
yes
but,
numerically,
no.
mr.
stanley
mosk
the
special
master
accurately
reports
that,
at
the
date
of
the
trial,
california's
projects
were
using
about
4.6
million
acre-feet
of
water.
now,
that
was
the
1956-1957
figure
to
which
evidence
relate.
1960,
we
used
about
5.1
million
acre-feet.
now,
on
california's
contentions,
there's
only
about
4.6
million
acre-feet
of
water
permanently
available
to
california.
we
are
temporarily
able
to
use
more
than
that,
a
half
million
more
acre-feet,
only
because
the
upper
basin
has
not
yet
put
to
use
its
colorado
river
water
apportion.
now,
of
course,
we
cannot
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
laws
of
nature
nor
do
we
ask
this
court
to
relieve
us
of
the
responsibility
or
the
consequences
of
either
of
the
two
agreements
which
california
entered
into
on
march
2,
1929,
the
colorado
river
compact
or
the
california
limitation
act.
we
do
earnestly
ask
this
court
not
to
rewrite
the
law
of
the
river
to
impose
on
california
a
drought
more
severe
than
that
which
nature
could
accomplish.
mr.
stanley
mosk
yes.
mr.
stanley
mosk
yes,
it
is.
mr.
stanley
mosk
we've
--
this
would
dry
up
our
source.
it
would
dry
up
the
metropolitan
water
district
almost
immediately
if
the
upper
basin
states
use
the
amount
they're
entitled
to
under
the
colorado
river
compact.
mr.
stanley
mosk
the
people
would
go
with
--
do
without
water,
i'm
afraid
--
mr.
stanley
mosk
until
such
time
as
we
could
find
an
alternative
source.
mr.
stanley
mosk
where
they
would
have
to
do
without
water
until
such
time
as
we
could
find
an
alternative
source.
mr.
stanley
mosk
we
believe,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that's
the
result
of
the
master's
recommendation
to
this
court.
mr.
stanley
mosk
yes,
we
do.
mr.
stanley
mosk
yes,
we
have
no
--
we
have
no
ready
answer
for
this
deficit
that
will
exist
and
if
--
the
deficit
is
certain
to
exist
if
the
master's
report
is
adopted.
the
issue,
as
we
see
it
in
this
case,
is
not
whether
california
will
have
water
for
a
new
project
from
the
colorado
river.
we
don't
seek
any
new
project.
the
issue
was
not
whether
any
existing
project
in
arizona
or
nevada
will
be
required
to
give
up
water
that
it
is
now
using,
nor
even
to
forego
its
planned
development.
we
concede
to
arizona
and
to
nevada
the
full
quantity
of
water
required
for
the
full
development
of
all
of
their
existing
projects.
we
don't
oppose
any
future
project
in
the
lower
basin
if
its
rights
are
recognized
as
being
junior
to
the
rights
of
existing
projects.
no
water,
not
even
water
temporarily
available,
should
be
permitted
to
waste
to
the
sea.
the
ultimate
issue,
in
terms
of
the
impact
upon
people
and
their
way
of
life,
is
whether
an
existing
california
project,
probably
the
greatest
municipal
water
supply
project
in
the
world,
must
be
wholly
destroyed
to
permit
the
building
of
a
new
reclamation
project
for
the
central
arizona
area.
mr.
stanley
mosk
yes,
some.
mr.
stanley
mosk
no,
not
at
all
--
excuse
me.
not
at
all,
mr.
ely
reminds
me.
mr.
stanley
mosk
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
mosk
solely
dependent
upon
the
colorado
river
aqueduct.
mr.
stanley
mosk
no,
they
get
water
from
the
sierras
as
well,
but
metropolitan
project
--
mr.
stanley
mosk
sir?
mr.
stanley
mosk
that
is
correct.
metropolitan
is
solely
dependent
upon
colorado
river
water.
mr.
stanley
mosk
only
los
angeles,
not
san
diego.
mr.
stanley
mosk
san
diego
is
wholly
dependent
upon
metropolitan.
destruction
of
metropolitan's
water
supply
results,
as
the
master
has
said
with
rather
commendable
frankness,
we
think,
not
from
resolving
arizona
and
california's
historic
controversy
in
arizona's
favor.
the
historic
controversy
between
arizona
and
california
has
been
over
the
colorado
river
compact.
the
master
would
resolve
that
conflict
in
every
material
particular
to
save
one
in
accordance
with
california's
contentions,
but
that
single
particular
is
his
conclusion
that
the
colorado
river
compact
is
irrelevant.
mr.
stanley
mosk
that
--
mr.
stanley
mosk
that
was
excluded
from
evidence
and
we
think
properly
so
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
stanley
mosk
it
will
not
be
in
substitution
for
the
metropolitan
water
district
project.
this
will
be
to
provide
for
the
expanding
population
of
california,
but
i
stress
the
fact
that
this
was
properly,
we
think,
excluded
from
evidence
by
the
master.
the
master's
conclusion
in
this
instance
that
the
colorado
river
compact
is
irrelevant
is
contrary
to
the
pleaded
contentions
of
arizona
and
of
california
in
this
suit
and
in
the
three
suits
which
preceded
this
one.
such
a
conclusion
was
never
suggested
in
any
form
in
which
this
controversy
was
mooted
until
after
the
close
of
the
trial
in
the
present
suit.
water
supply
in
which
7
million
people
depend
should
not
be
destroyed
on
the
basis
of
an
issue
discovered
for
the
first
time
decades
after
the
project
had
been
constructed.
now,
of
course,
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
master
denies
that
the
decree
recommended
will
have
the
disastrous
effect
that
aren't
tested.
he
says,
at
page
115
of
his
report,
"existing
california
users
are
in
no
danger
of
curtailment
unless
and
until
many
vast
new
projects,
some
of
which
are
not
even
contemplated
at
this
time,
are
approved
by
congress
and
constructed."
his
optimism
is
repeated
in
the
briefs
of
the
other
parties.
if
the
master
is
right,
this
suit
is
premature
and
unnecessary
but
the
ultimate
issue
in
terms
of
legal
consequences
is
this.
who
should
bear
the
risk
that
the
master's
optimism
is
ill-founded?
throughout
the
west,
under
the
law
of
prior
appropriation,
the
risk
of
water
supply
is
on
the
newest
project.
the
sponsors
of
a
new
project
can
best
calculate
the
risk.
they
alone
can
decide
whether
to
undertake
that
risk.
we
have
sought
priority
only
to
the
extent
of
4.4
million
acre-feet
per
annum
and
only
insofar
as
the
dates
of
initiation
of
our
projects
make
them
senior
to
later
initiated
projects
in
other
states.
mr.
stanley
mosk
yes,
they
would.
mr.
stanley
mosk
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
risk
we
are
unwilling
to
assume
is
one
that
--
is
one
that
places
the
entire
supply
of
the
metropolitan
water
district
of
southern
california
at
the
hazard
of
certain
destruction
if
the
colorado
river
compact
is
ever
enforced
against
the
lower
basin.
that's
a
risk,
we
believe,
that
should
be
born,
if
it
all,
by
a
new
project
and
not
prior
project
on
which
seven
million
people
have
come
to
depend.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
will
present
mr.
northcutt
ely.
he's
the
special
assistant
attorney
general
of
california.
he
will
argue
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
california
defendants.
