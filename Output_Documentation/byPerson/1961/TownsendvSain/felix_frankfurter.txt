justice
felix
frankfurter
and
since
--
since
you're
being
interrupted
at
the
outset,
may
i
put
to
one
side,
there's
no
suggestion
in
this
case
that
the
confession
was
due
or
the
result
of
excessive
retention
during
which
the
petitioner
was
applied
to
improper
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
not
in
your
question
presented
mr.
leighton.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
it's
worthwhile
taking
your
time
if
it
is
concluded
in
your
question,
but
for
me,
those
are
--
and
i
take
it
for
you
distinct
question
namely
was
he
under
--
was
he
under
extensive
questioning,
whatever
the
conditions
of
the
questioning
maybe,
and
was
the
injection
of
this
drug
in
and
of
itself
an
impairment
of
his
mind
such
as
to
preclude
of
finding
of
voluntariness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
two
different
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was,
reading
the
question
presented,
which
i
did
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
--
i
didn't
get
the
impression
that
will
raise
excessive
detention
as
a
separate
claim
but
maybe
you
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
alright,
you
come
to
it,
but
it's
--
how
many
hours
all
total
--
what
length
of
time
was
he
under
questioning,
mr.
leighton?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
questioned
during
that
period?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
period
during
which
the
doctor
came?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
isn't
the
essence
of
your
case
then
that
the
injection
of
this
drug
whether
you
would
question
three
minutes
or
five
minutes
or
even
voluntarily,
emitted
his
confession?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
drug
impaired,
whatever
he
said
during
the
immediate
period
of
its
administration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
question
of,
periods
of
question
seemed
to
me
quite
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right,
i
don't
want
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
due
course,
in
due
course,
i
hope
you
disentangle
the
two
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
there
--
one
more
thing,
was
there
later
repetition
of
this
confession?
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
the
period
of
the
drug?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
may
i
ask
whether
the
--
what
you
call
a
show-up,
is
that
a
line
up?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
with
others
therefore?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
himself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
somebody
wasn't
brought
in,
this
the
man?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
have
no
grievance
about
that,
have
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
missed
something
mr.
leighton,
i
missed
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
intervene
--
i
mean
how
did
cagney
come
to
call?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
got
the
impression
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
that
townsend
indicated
that
how
he
felt,
is
that
a
wrong
impression
mr.
leighton?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
mean
that
i
get
from
the
record
because
i
haven't
read
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
got
the
impression
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
wondered
if
i
got
the
wrong
impression
from
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
ask?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
--
well,
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
referring
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
leighton,
this
is
for
me
at
least,
a
very
crucial
part
of
your
--
of
the
case.
is
there
any
suggestion,
is
there
any
implication
in
what
you
said
that
there
was
any
kind
of
cahoots,
i
don't
mean
use
the
phrase,
any
kind
of
pre-arranging
between
the
police
in
bringing
a
doctor
there
and
the
anticipated
presence
of
the
district
attorney,
anything
like
comparable
to
what
we
had
and
what
is
layer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
--
what
do
you
claim
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
those
two
drugs
were
the
same
drug
with
different
names?
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
forgive
me,
i
must
to
ask
some
questions
about
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
any
basis
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
cagney
knew
in
advance
their
townsend
would
need
administration
of
a
doctor,
more
particularly
that
a
drug
having
--
having
amnesia
or
potential
amnesia
effect
would
be
injected?
and
that
this
all
was
by
way
of
pre-arrangement
other
than
--
is
there
any
evidence
to
indicate
that
all
of
these
have
anticipated
that
cagney
knew
that
it
(inaudible)
found
in
this
expressing
condition,
express
condition,
he
would
then
the
doctor
and
that
they
were
a
non-articulated
or
non-disclosed
pre-arrangement?
i
ask
it
because
i
see
a
very
strongly
about
such
a
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
time
period,
i'm
quite
ignorant
about
these
things
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
--
is
it
well-known
or
is
there
evidence
(inaudible)
allowing
the
inference
that
a
police
official
with
experience
would
know
that
at
a
certain
period,
during
which
the
withdrawal
would
operate
deleteriously
so
that
injection
will
be
proper
etcetera,
etcetera
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
anything
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
on
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
was
an
addict?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
this
canvass
at
the
post-trial,
at
the
post-conviction
proceeding
in
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
--
because
i
read
the
quotation
of
the
post-conviction
proceedings
that
they
didn't
quite
(inaudible)
they
said
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
my
comment
as
elicited
was
invoked
by
the
quotation
in
state's
brief
on
page
26
in
dealing
with
the
pertinent
portion
of
the
order
denying
post
conviction
relief
and
it
appears
for
me,
(inaudible)
be
guided
by
that.
apparently,
the
point
that
was
made
was
that
there
was
a
confusion
as
to
be
name
of
this
drug
and
no
mention
is
made
to
these
other
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
assuming
--
the
court
(inaudible)
they're
assuming
they
could
escape
the
doctrine
of
reasonable
(inaudible)
but
it
then
deals
with
that
point
on
the
merits
from
which
i
am
referred,
there
is
no
other
points
to
get
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
you
at
post-conviction
in
illinois
offer
to
introduce
new
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
make
that
offer
at
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
it
was
refused
--
you
were
refused
to
make
this
pharmacological
proof?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
have
you
--
did
you
--
but
only
to
be
a
stickler
to
the
murder
case
likely
the
state,
but
did
you
presented
--
one
of
the
questions
presented
that
you
weren't
allowed
in
the
post-conviction
proceedings
to
introduce
claimed
relevant
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
raise
one
of
the
questions
that
we
had
to
consider
this
question
that
you
were
shut
off
from
introducing
relevant
evidence
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding
of
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
have
to
give
post-conviction
proceedings
subject
to
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
do
what
you're
now
saying
is
that
you
were
denied
the
due
process
in
not
being
allowed
to
introduce
relevant
evidence,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
there
was
no
such
question
presented
by
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here,
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yeah.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
questioned
all
this
because
i
feel
as
i
do
about
layer
and
i
notice
while
you
drew
a
defense
from
justice
schaffer
on
the
ground
that
the
administration
of
the
drug
in
and
on
of
itself
destroyed
--
rendered
the
confession
not
voluntary.
there's
no
suggestion
by
him
in
his
dissent
about
the
layer
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
that's
--
i
say
again,
i'm
so
alert
about
that
problem
that
i
had
troubled
you
with
these
specific
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you're
--
what
you're
putting
to
the
court
is
that
the
police
officer
with
such
lay
knowledge
--
as
knowledge
to
be
acquired
as
the
laymen
about
condition
of
--
of
narcotic
addicts
would
know
roughly
speaking
that
within
20
hours
the
withdrawal
symptoms
would
manifest
themselves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
also
knew
--
he
also
knew
that
relief
would
be
required
by
a
doctor.
that
he
also
knew
that
--
that
a
doctor
would
examine
him,
he
would
examine
him,
but
he
would
give
him
this
drug
which
had
the
deleterious
effect
and
that
the
sum
total
of
all
these
was
the
pre-arrangement
that
getting
him
in
a
condition
of
mind
which
precluded
a
voluntary
emission
of
words,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
case
you
make.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
from
cases,
the
record
sustains
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
in
cases
where
the
interrogation
in
and
of
itself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
precludes
assuming
that
man
is
(inaudible)
or
he's
in
a
position
of
his
packaging.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
here,
that
is
ruled
out
so
far
as
length
of
time
is
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
main
position
as
i
understand
is
that
the
administration
of
this
drug
has
such
as
physiological
effect
upon
the
human
faculty
that
what
takes
place
during
the
period
of
its
operation
is
not
the
will
at
any
true
sense
--
in
any
meaningful
sense
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
a
very
different
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
concocting
a
scheme
whereby
it
should
be
put
into
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wouldn't
any
--
wouldn't
any
district
attorney
who
had
the
suspect
--
a
suspect
as
to
murder
beyond
the
alert
and
make
preparations
in
the
hope
and
or
expectation
even
that
he
might
need
a
stenographer,
that
he
ought
to
be
on
the
job.
i
don't
see
anything
sinister
about
that
mr.
leighton.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
am
i
wrong
in
the
thinking
mr.
leighton
that
if
they
had
not
summoned
a
doctor
as
he
requested,
if
they
had
not
given
a
medical
release
and
then
by
sheer
(inaudible)
is
his
pain
get
well
through
with
it,
yes
i
did
it
but
you
would
then
not
only
would
but
i
should
think
it
would
be
your
duty
almost
to
say
that
a
man
in
that
distressing
--
distressful
painful
condition
would
not
a
man
fit
to
make
any
utterance
so
that
when
you
say
they
didn't
do
it
for
humanitarian
reasons
like
most
human
conduct,
there
maybe
conflicts
of
consideration,
i
should
think
that's
a
far
cry
from
saying
this
was
a
concocted
arrangement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
my
question
is
i
think
of
i
have
wasted
--
i
have
taking
time
from
your
main
proposition
that
the
mere
administration
of
drug
in
and
off
itself
is
to
vitiate
this
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
--
that's
the
point
of
your
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
they
before
the
district
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
but
they
didn't
come
up
here,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
they
are
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
justice
harlan
is
asking
is
here
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
want
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
everything
is
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
line
of
evidence
was
not
pursued
at
the
trial
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
did
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
tried
to
clarify
this
to
myself.
i
think
when
justice
harlan
was
speaking
some
of
the
cross
purposes,
what
you've
just
said
you
had
formally
presented
namely
that
the
district
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
misconceived
the
scope
of
his
reviewing
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
understood
justice
harlan
to
ask
you
and
what
interested
me
also
is
whether
you
specifically,
whether
you
made
a
specific
offer
of
proof
that
in
the
--
that
there
was
a
factual
in
the
case
of
pharmacological
factors
which
for
one
reason
or
other,
it's
not
emerge
at
the
trial,
had
not
been
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
yet,
from
your
point
of
view,
goes
to
the
basic
vice
of
the
conviction,
namely
that
a
--
that
a
--
what
do
they
call
it,
the
portion
(inaudible),
a
dosage
was
given.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
in
and
off
itself
has
translated
to
--
to
disempower,
to
really
disable
any
human
being
particularly
(inaudible),
to
be
in
a
state
of
mind
whereby
a
confession
had
voluntary
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
there's
difference
between
saying,
which
for
me
there's
difference
in
the
legal
proposition
that
broadly
speaking,
the
district
court
wasn't
following
what
you
conceive
to
be
brown
v.
allen
standard
and
justice
harlan's
specific
question
as
to
whether
this
--
this
item
of
evidence
was
by
you
specifically
in
terms
offered
to
anybody,
to
any
court,
either
post
conviction
court
or
later
in
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
although
there's
a
chance
to
make
a
court
list
to
an
offer
of
evidence
and
having
rejected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
claimed
you
could
rip
open
the
whole
proceedings,
that
what
you
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
claim
that
you
could
rip
open
the
whole
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
therefore,
it
is
important
for
us
if
i
may
so
to
see
exactly
what
your
case
you
made
out
in
this
request
that
you
called
it
to
be
heard
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
order
to
determine
whether
judge
igoe
was
justified
under
the
remand
to
say,
“i
don't
have
go
outside,
the
record
made
in
the
state
court,”
isn't
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
compared
your
--
your
petition,
your
generalized
allegation
as
to
why
you're
in
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
have
taking
place
to
the
state
courts
through
which
the
trial,
the
affirmance
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
the
post-conviction
hearing
and
said,
“this
is
within
brown
and
allen
for
me
to
rest
on
the
state
proceedings.
i
don't
have
to
have
a
de
nova
hearing."
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wasn't
the
issue,
the
issue
on
which
that
were
tended
at
the
trial
and
the
issue
that
was
tended
at
the
post-conviction
proceedings,
the
same
--
or
at
the
habeas
corpus,
the
same
issue
as
a
matter
of
law
namely
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
validly
admissible?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
tender
of
what
you
call
the
fact
against
the
document
was
directed
to
the
--
to
the
issue
the
same
issue
in
different
proceedings
that
concerned
at
the
same
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
i
don't
quite
follow
what
you're
saying
that
when
the
state
offered
these
at
the
trial,
they
were
excluded
by
the
--
on
the
defendant's
motion
as
being
harmful,
but
then
on
habeas
corpus
that
which
was
excluded
and
might
have
been
--
might
have
helped
the
state's
case
can
now
be
the
basis
for
saying
that
the
conviction
was
unconstitutionally
obtained.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
he
had
to
decide
the
same
thing
namely,
whether
a
confession
was
so
crucial
to
the
conviction
was
validly
introduced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
--
if
--
if
those
coroner
proceedings
were
improperly
admissible
in
the
trial
for
--
or
some
conceivable
advantage
to
the
prosecution,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
have
a
constitutional
right
of
having
a
different
trial
on
the
same
issue
in
a
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
relation
to
the
same
problem
namely,
whether
a
conviction
based
on
a
confession
was
a
sustainable
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that
otherwise
--
otherwise,
you'd
have
some
trial
tactic
at
the
trial
in
the
state
court
in
which
the
defendant
takes
the
position,
which
he
then
thinks
the
admission
or
exclusion
of
evidence
as
far
his
benefit,
he's
convicted
and
then
we'll
have
another
trial
in
the
federal
court
when
he
thinks
for
that
purpose,
it's
his
advantage
to
introduce
something
that
he
himself
kept
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
it
was
excluded
--
it's
offered
and
excluded
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
but
the
fact
of
--
not
the
confession
themselves
but
the
basis
for
putting
in
the
fact
that
there
will
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
depends
on
the
allegations
in
the
--
in
the
application
for
habeas
corpus,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
again
--
one
--
this
court,
or
district
court
rather
again
answered
your
--
the
question
you
just
put
unless
he
examines,
unless
he
puts
the
file
for
cds
alongside
of
the
allegations
in
the
application
for
habeas
corpus
and
finds
out
whether
or
not
and
if
so
why
allegations
made
in
the
applications
for
habeas
corpus
were
not
canvassed,
if
they
were
not
canvassed
in
the
trial
court
and
the
state
court,
otherwise
you
can't
tell,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
district
court
must
examine
and
see
what
happened
in
the
trial
court
in
order
to
find
out
where
there
anything
is
open
for
him
to
consider?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
do
they
sleep?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
do
they
sleep?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
plainly,
the
state
wasn't
contended
to
rest
on
that
oral
confession
or
admission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
the
vice
or
virtue
of
the
written
confession
is
essential
to
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
by
way
of
curiosity
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
people
held
in
a
condition
and
which
he
was
given
access
to
narcotics,
although
he
carried
on
his
person,
is
he
allowed
to?
i'm
just
curious.
you
say
he
took
another
shot
of
narcotic
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
beforehand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
16.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
tell
--
tell
us
whether
in
the
application
to
habeas
corpus
before
judge
igoe,
a
specific
allegation
was
made
that
there
was
administered
to
the
applicant,
counsel
by
a
state
or
a
city
doctor,
the
dosage
which
would
have
that
you
call
these
radical
effects.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
issue
adverted
to,
however,
indirectly
but
sufficient
--
sufficiently
so
to
indicate
that's
an
issue
raised
namely
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
state
official,
the
state
doctor
administered
a
toxic
producing
drug,
is
that
in
the
application?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
habeas
corpus
before
judge
igoe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
read
it
as
carefully
as
any
human
being
could,
would
it
be
alluded
to
the
fact
that
that
issue
is
sought
to
be
canvassed
by
new
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
is
cheap
play,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
ground
on
which
that
justice
schaffer
dissented.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
been
an
issue
in
the
case
from
the
time
it
got,
certainly
as
far
as
the
record
before
me
goes,
it's
been
before
supreme
court
illinois
in
whatever
it
was
1958.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
no,
there
was
no
question
of
dosage
before
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
indicated
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
along
by
years,
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
affirmed
this
conviction,
on
march
20,
1957.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he's
right
about
this,
if
it
should
--
should
be
so,
assuming
having
no
thought
of
--
but
i'm
stating,
making
a
prophecy,
i
haven't
view
on
it,
assuming
this
conviction
or
assuming
that
there
was
an
affirmance,
that
he's
right
on
this
issue,
he
could
start
all
over
again
in
the
district
court,
the
u.s.
district
court
saying
that
in
fact
that
now
he
found
out
that
what
he
hadn't
known
before
for
one
reason
or
another
that
a
toxic
producing
dosage
was
administered.
i
suppose
that
can
be
raised
along
as
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
state
would
have
to
answer
and
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting.
i'm
not
commenting
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
the
opposite
in
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
problem
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
answer
justice
brennan
--
justice
stewart's
question
that
this
is
a
conventional
means
of
therapy
for
alleviating
withdrawal
pain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
recognized
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
the
most
recognized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
most
recognized
and
certainly,
is
the
dosage
--
is
the
grain
dosage
recognized
as
the
appropriate
dosage
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
that
purpose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
this
is
entirely
oral
knowledge
on
the
part
of
doctors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
this
is
--
dr.
--
what's
his
name
mansfield?
that
dr.
mansfield
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
gave
a
dosage
which
he
thought
adequate
according
--
on
the
basis
of
his
experience,
no
(inaudible)
has
nothing
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
medical
treaters?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
on
the
question
of
dosage,
the
propriety
--
the
medical
propriety
of
the
dosage
given
for
this
purpose
as
against
truth
of
visitation
canvassed
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
--
did
the
loyola
expert
indicate
that
this
dosage
was
not
a
therapeutic
dosage
but
illicit
--
not
an
illicit
but
a
truth
evoking
dosage?
justice
felix
frankfurter
normal
for
the
purpose
of
therapy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
normal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of
the
physiological
constitution
of
townsend,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
there
was
an
examination
and
cross-examination
of
this
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
suppression
issue
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
the
main
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
all
canvassed
at
both
decisions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
you
--
the
--
you
take
part
of
the
hearing
before
the
supreme
court
on
appeal.
are
you
in
that
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
looked
at
the
briefs
before
the
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether
this
issue
was
raised
before
the
supreme
court
in
which
your
court
decided
that
it
is
with
justice
schaffer
finding
that
the
administration
of
this
as
such
rather
than
the
--
that
was
the
dosage
factor,
or
(inaudible)
an
issue
before
that
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
--
they
first
disposed
it
on
per
covered
on
opinion
i
gather,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
opinion
--
no
first
opinion
in
the
books,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean
in
english?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean
in
english?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
--
looking
at
your
table
--
the
book
you
cite,
the
authorities,
citations.
i
find
no
reference
to
any
of
the
literature
and
i
knew
about
it
but
many
years
ago
even
then,
there
was
already
a
large
body
of
literature
dealing
with
criminal
investigations
including
the
various
drugs
that
are
used
etcetera,
etcetera.
was
that
covered
in
chicago
in
the
northwestern
university
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
got
a
book
on
criminal
investigation,
are
there
books
that
deal
with
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
the
--
this
--
under
--
at
least
relatively
recently,
there's
a
much
heavier
literature
on
the
continent
in
england
than
there
is
with
us.
but
now,
several
institutions,
they
got
professors
of
what
called
forensic
medicine
dealing
with
these
problems.
now,
they
thought
these
problems
or
haven't
they
been
examined
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
but
in
effect,
what
mr.
leighton,
he
will
correct
me
if
i
misinterpret
him,
in
effect,
mr.
leighton
says
that
we
may
take
judicial
notice
which
we
--
we
may
inform
ourselves
by
sources
other
than
human
testimony
at
the
trial
or
any
of
the
proceedings
that
we
may
inform
ourselves
on
the
basis
of
scientific
data
with
a
lot
of
books,
we've
established
that,
would
be
recognized
that
the
effect
of
this
drug
is
essentially
to
put
the
human
being
to
sleep.
as
i
understand
it,
that
his
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sufficiently
--
sufficiently
to
sleep
so
that
what
emanates
from
the
mouth,
hasn't
the
attendant
mind
behind
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
so
as
--
so
as
toxic
quality
with
the
treatment
of
these
many
dosages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
talking
about
poison,
doesn't
say
much.
and
what
you're
--
are
you
saying
then
that
--
that
granting
that
this
drug
has
potentialities
of
sustaining
the
claim
he
makes,
the
potentialities
turned
into
reality
only
on
proof
that
the
dosage
was
of
such
a
quantity
that
it
did
have
that
effect.
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
but
if
--
if
it
was
given
with
a
truth
serum,
it
was
given
with
a
dosage
that
would
have
this
paralyzing
--
mentally
paralyzing
or
will
paralyzing
effect
then
the
confession
is
(inaudible)
and
what
you
say
is
that,
if
i
follow
you,
that
this
issue
was
canvassed
in
state
courts
and
--
and
the
--
there's
no
basis
on
this
record
for
finding
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
you
say
he
goes
beyond
that
and
you
say
that
this
court
may
--
may
as
to
the
matter
of
judicial
notice
find
and
conclude
that
the
effect
of
this
drug
is
inescapably
to
paralyze
the
will
or
freedom
of
the
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
issue
--
the
issue
really
is
that
--
i
--
i
feel
that
my
job
is
to
go
and
look
up
all
the
books
on
toxicology,
forensic
medicine,
etcetera,
etcetera
and
find
out
what
is
their
basis
for
my
concluding
that
in
fact,
this
drug
cannot
be
administered,
that
there
isn't
an
innocent
dosage
of
this
drug
so
far
as
keeping
the
will
and
the
mind
free.
that's
really
what
the
issue
is
intended
means.
now,
what
about,
it
hasn't
been
dealt
with,
there
were
subsequent
confessions.
how
long
--
how
long
--
assuming
the
drug
does
operate,
the
way
mr.
leighton
contended
operates,
how
long
is
that
such
a
numbing
effect
lasts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
five
to
eight
hours.
now,
were
there
confessions
after
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
--
the
state
claim
--
what
is
the
state's
provision
as
to
the
independent
validity
of
those
confessions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
assuming
--
assuming
the
first
confession
was
invalid,
can
the
subsequent
confessions,
pieces
of
paper
amounting
to
confessors
so
far
as
the
words
go,
can
they
have
testimony
of
validity
considering
the
fact
that
they
were
reproductions
of
the
original,
for
the
purposes
of
my
question,
original
invalid
confessions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
was
confronted
with
something
that
he
confessed
to,
that
what
was
if
you
please,
extorted
from
him
by
virtue
of
this
drug
which
was
an
illegal
intrusion
into
his
rights.
and
therefore,
he
is
already
even
confronted
with
something
that
might
be
used
against
him
(inaudible)
what
court
will
decide,
so
(inaudible)
to
say
that
--
that
that
considered
adoption
of
the
earlier
confession
even
if
dependant
act
on
his
part
admissible
as
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
--
was
he
cross-examined
as
to
the
circumstances
--
regarding
the
circumstances
of
this
second
piece
of
paper
where
the
signature
is
acknowledged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
his
testimony
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
he
signed,
this
being
twelve
or
thirteen
hours
after
the
effect
of
the
drug
was
drawn?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
this
was
merely
a
--
a
transcription
from
the
stenographic
notes,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
leighton,
have
you
availed
of
those
briefs
that
were
submitted
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
limitations
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)

with
the
clerk
(inaudible)
