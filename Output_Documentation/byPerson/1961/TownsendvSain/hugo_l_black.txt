justice

black
i
want
to
ask
you
one
more
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
been
waiting
to
ask
you
this.
i
didn't
quite
understand
one
statement
you
made.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
was
your
belief
that
this
case
should
be
ended
now
and
that
our
determination,
if
we
made
it,
this
evidence
of
the
confession
being
involuntary
was
not
supported
by
evidence
within
the
case.
why
would
that
be
in
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
do
not
claim
then
that
he
wouldn't
have
to
be
retried.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
you
would
contend
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
all
i
want
to
find.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
that
judge
igoe
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
we
could
not
take
out
evidence
in
addition
to
that
which
is
shown
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
if
he
considered
he
had
the
power
to
do
so
if
he
wanted
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
he
reached
the
conclusion
that
he
shouldn't
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
basis
that
the
findings
were
issued,
were
tried
out
and
therefore
they
should
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
--
again,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
--
i
don't
--
i
that
brings
it
back
to
my
first
question.
is
it
your
--
do
you
think
that
he
tried
it
on
the
assumption
that
if
he
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
issues
had
been
tried
in
the
court
and
a
decision
made
that
he
had
no
power
to
go
into
those
same
issues
again
and
bring
in
additional
evidence
on
either
side.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
on
the
premise
or
are
you
presenting
an
argument
you
have
been
presenting
on
the
premise
because
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
when
the
issues
have
been
--
the
issues
of
facts
have
been
tried
on
this
constitutional
question
raised
--
was
raised
--
based
has
been
tried
in
the
state
court
on
evidence,
carried
to
the
supreme
court
and
it
affirms
that
bars
any
--
going
behind
those
findings
on
a
federal
--
in
a
habeas
--
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
why
they
have
been
tried
out
by
the
state
court
with
the
issues
squarely
presented
evidence
offered
on
each
side
and
findings
made
in
the
state
court.
are
you
proceeding
--
is
your
argument
based
on
the
premise
that
should
in
the
matter
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
i'm
talking
about
fact-finding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
you
call
the
application
of
the
facts
to
the
law
a
fact-finding
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
i
understand
your
position
here
is
that
findings
of
facts
made
in
the
state
courts
whether
--
and
approved
by
the
state
supreme
court
should
be
accepted
as
final
and
binding
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
constitutional
issue
raised
on
habeas
corpus.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
judge
igoe's
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
about
that?
