clark
i
wonder

what
will
you

with
that
confession
or
statement

whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
he
told
the
policeman
before

objection
of
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
that
he
had
hit
the
man
over
the
head
with
brick
in
this
place
where
they
found
this
victim.
justice
tom
c.

is
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
as

justice
tom
c.
clark
there's
nothing
in
the
record
showing
that
he
has
suffered
withdrawal
symptoms
before
previously
in

occasion.
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course,
that

canvassed
and
it
was
based
in
the
record,
wasn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
question
was
canvassed
and
was
in
the
record
of
the
state
court
that
igoe
was
looking
at
the
question
of
the
confession.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'm
taking
about
the
post-conviction
--
state
post-conviction
trial
--

where
i
understood

say
that
he
was
