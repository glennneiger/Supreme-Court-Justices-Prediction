justice

stewart
did
anybody
tried
to
get
to
him?
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
the
heroin
on
hour
or
two
before
he
was
arrested?
justice
potter
stewart
on
midnight
on
new
year's
eve?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
was
now
new
year's
night?
justice
potter
stewart
the
same
night.
justice
potter
stewart
cagney
was
the
police
officer
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
about
20
hours.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
case
in
which
the
record
shows
that
he
confessed
to
good
many,
other
offenses?
justice
potter
stewart
and
some
--
at
least
on
one
of
which
he
was
found
not
guilty
and
couple
other
were
--
couple
of
others
were
(inaudible)
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
the
same
drug
that
called
a
“twilight
sleeps”?
justice
potter
stewart
you
talked
about
--
you
talked
several
times
about
a
normal
therapeutic
dose.
therapeutically
used
this
--
this
drug
is
used
for
the
alleviation
of
withdrawal
symptoms
of
narcotics,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
--
are
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
how
about
the
normal
dose
for
--
for
the
purpose
of
--
the
truth
serum
purpose
which
is
a
different
purpose
from
a
therapeutic
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
really
--
your
probing
too
much.
now,
because
you
do
conceive
that
this
drug
was
administered,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
you're
saying
now
would
show
that
it
hadn't
been
administered
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
just
that
the
dosage
was
very
small?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
point.
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
it
true
--
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
some
of
this
clinical
scientific
material
show
that
--
that
far
from
eliciting
the
truth,
it
often
elicits
delusionary
telling?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
now
how
long
after
his
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
--
going
back
just
a
moment
to
the
post-conviction
of
state
proceedings
as
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
you
said
the
--
it
was
dismissed.
was
there
a
hearing
of
any
kind?
justice
potter
stewart
without
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
specific
question
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked
you,
was
more
directly
related
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
man
was
suffering
from
withdrawal
symptoms
and
we've
learned
from
the
record
in
other
cases
that
this
is
a
very
serious
illness.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
a
person
so
suffering
has
a
compulsive
need,
either
for
a
desire,
either
for
more
narcotics
or
for
some
sort
of
medicine
to
ease
the
great
pain
of
that
illness.
now,
certainly
a
confession
made
under
those
circumstances
and
a
confession
made
when
they
--
when
no
doctor
was
called
to
administer
to
that
illness
would
be
--
would
raise
a
much
more
serious
constitutional
question
than
this
one,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
has
immunizes
narcotics
addict
from
an
interrogation,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
the
subsequent
criminal
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
this
can
be
introduced
in
evidence
against
them
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
will
be
used
for
cross-examination?
justice
potter
stewart
which
or
both?
justice
potter
stewart
then
any
prior
inconsistent
statement
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
can
be
used
by
the
prosecution
in
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
that's
just
a
--
that's
--
you're
basing
that
just
on
a
chronology.
now,
what
if
a
man
had
refuse
to
talk
about
a
crime
of
which
he
was
suspected
of
committing
and
said
he
had
a
headache
and
they
gave
him
two
aspirin
tablets.
and
thereafter,
he
did
confess.
would
your
rule
apply?
justice
potter
stewart
well
and
the
only
fact
being
that
before
the
aspirin,
he
didn't
talk
and
after
the
aspirin,
he
did
talk.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
your
rule
would
apply
then.
justice
potter
stewart
there
hasn't
been
a
finding
that
his
will
was
not
overcome
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
the
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
it
couldn't
have
been.
justice
potter
stewart
being
merely
the
fact
that
after
the
drug,
he
did
confess.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
if
--
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
direct
appeal
first,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
how
important
this
is
in
this
case
but
i
don't
entirely
understand
what
you're
saying.
if
he's
satisfied
with
it
then
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
referring
more
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
end
of
it
and
there
would
be
anymore
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
know,
wouldn't
you?
and
if
he
began
adducing
evidence,
he
would
indicate
that
he
was
not
satisfied
with
the
state
court
record.
justice
potter
stewart
is
judge
igoe's
order
in
this
case
appearing
or
excerpt
in
the
original
record?
i
can't
seem
to
find
anything
that
we
have
on
the
briefs.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
original
record
would
be
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
missed
i'm
sorry.
justice
potter
stewart
it
attached
no
significance
to
what?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
hitting
a
man
over
his
head
with
a
brick,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
remembered
a
complete
lack
of
corroboration
from
any
of
these
officers.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
those
circumstances
are
just
the
opposite
from
any
indication
that
his
mental
processes
had
been
affected
adversely.
justice
potter
stewart
really
experiencing
what
you
might
have
done
and
might
not
have
done
but
what
we
have
here
is
the
case
where
somebody
have
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
none
of
this
is
in
the
record.
this
is
in
the
literature.
justice
potter
stewart
all
of
these
victims
were
skid
road
dwellers,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
no?
