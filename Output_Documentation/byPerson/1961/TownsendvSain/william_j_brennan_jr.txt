but
no
--
but
no
supplemental
testimony
taken?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
request?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'll
come
to
that
i
guess.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
a
grain
or
a
gram?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
grain?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
leighton,
your
time
is
bleeding
and
i
don't
want
to
burden
you
but
i
am
very
interested
in
finding
what
it
was
you
wanted,
in
the
way
of
additional
testimony
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
this
goes
to
the
gram
versus
grain.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
would
have
taken
what,
the
form
of
expert
testimony
that
accepting
the
testimony
of
the
trial
that
was
gram
and
not
grain.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
this
would
have
met
16
times
a
normal
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
--
was
that
the
extent
of
the
testimony?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
all
of
this
then
goes
really
to
expert
testimony
not
produced
in
any
proceeding
in
the
illinois.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
you
wanted
to
supplement
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
at
the
hearing
before
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
the
extent
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
in
25
and
26,
i
maybe
wrong
mr.
leighton,
25
and
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
those
transcripts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
typed
form?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
we
keep
(inaudible)
quite
importantly
mr.
leighton.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
you
filed
the
petition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
go
before
judge
igoe
at
anytime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happened
before
judge
igoe
in
respect
of
what
proceedings
should
be
followed
on
the
petition,
what
did
happen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
means
of
--
meaning
of
why
when
you
said
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
what
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
was
this
oral
admission
was
made,
was
it
after
he
returned
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
this
--
is
that
to
say
then
that
the
oral
admission
must
have
been
made
after
8:30?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
--
your
associate
was
not
called
at
8:35?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
thought
you
told
us
that
the
practice
was
not
to
call
one
of
the
attorneys
until
it
was
clear
that
the
suspect
was
ready
to
talk.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
clear
is,
if
the
oral
admission
was
not
made
until
after
8:30,
then
almost
simultaneously
the
state's
attorney
must
have
been
telephoned
and
told
about
this,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
a
hearing
is
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
was
that
this
had
not
been
in
court,
in
the
state
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
why
has
it
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
with
that
knowledge
on
the
volume
of
the
drug
of
that
type
or
kind,
mr.
justice
fortas
statement
of
(inaudible)
stated
by
the
defense
counsel
then,
would
that
offer
you
a
substantial
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
how
much,
as
the
facts
have
claimed,
confessions
to
be
vital
or
(inaudible)
how
much
of
that
facts
were
indicated
and
stated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
evidence
(inaudible)
demonstrated
the
unreliability
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
the
same
drug.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
this
coroner's
hearing
state?
is
this
something
special
or
--
what's
its
nature
anyway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
it
formal
like
this
all
the
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
these
five
separate
confessions
or
just
a
confession
to
five
murders?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understood
it,
unless
townsend
took
the
stand
to
this
trial,
the
minutes
of
the
inquest
could
not
be
used
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
by
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
only
on
--
for
cross-examination
if
townsend
had
taken
the
stand
and
he
didn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
he
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
did
use
them
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
leighton,
i
thought
from
what
you
said
to
us
yesterday,
you're
in
federal
habeas
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
raise
a
question
to
this
whether
you're
entitled
to
a
rehearing,
retrial
or
call
it
what
you
will
of
your
constitutional
claim
in
federal
habeas
before
the
district
court,
didn't
you
tell
us
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
been
denied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
that's
why
i'm
a
little
puzzled
when
you
say
you
don't
want
a
rehearing,
i
think
we
ought
finally
could
decide
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you're
invoking
then
the
doctrine
that
on
occasions
where
a
constitutional
claim
rests
on
fact-finding,
we
may
examine
the
record
to
see
whether
those
fact-findings
are
supported,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
think
--
and
your
argument
here
is
that
it's
not
necessary
to
have
another
hearing
because
these
fact-findings
which
have
been
against
you
are
not
supportable
by
the
record
in
respect
to
the
constitutional
claim
you
mentioned.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
leighton,
i
have
somewhat
the
same
recollection
with
my
brother
harlan.
i
understood
that
this
was
administered
while
he
was
exhibiting
withdrawal
symptom
from
an
earlier
application
of
the
drug
that
he
taken
himself
and
that
this
was
administered
to
relieve
him
of
the
pains
of
withdrawal
symptoms.
was
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
was
there
a
fact-finding
that
this
administered
to
relieve
withdrawal
symptom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
ever
a
practice
mr.
hladis
to
supplement
the
conditional
testimony?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
understand
it
but
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
the
district
court
should
first
--
before
he
does
anything,
examine
the
state
court
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
my
brother
stewart
suggest
if
he
decides
that
the
constitutional
question
was
properly
considered
and
decided,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
--
if
he
thinks
something
more
is
required
then
what
does
he
do,
does
he
merely
supplement
the
state
court
record
or
does
he
retry
factually
the
constitutional
claims.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
the
same
record
obviously
since
judge
igoe
didn't
supplement
it.
i
must
confess
i'm
a
little
confused
about
what
mr.
leighton's
position
is
but
i
gather
that
the
last
thing
he
answered
me
was,
if
we
think
well
of
it,
we
can
send
it
back
for
at
least
supplemental
--
supplementing
this
record
on
the
properties
of
the
drug
hyoscine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
anything
about
his
undergoing
withdrawal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
dr.
mansfield
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
in
no
circumstances.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
those.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
label?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
at
the
trial
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that's
the
extent
to
which
counsel
sought
supplementing
in
the
state
record
--
