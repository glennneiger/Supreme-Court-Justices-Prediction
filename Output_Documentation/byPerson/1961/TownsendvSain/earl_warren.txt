(voice

chief

what
i
wanted

ask

this.
is
there
anything
in

equitable
a

as
he
took
prior
from
his
arrest
before
he
would
show
these
withdrawal
symptoms
and

the
substance
as

to
show
(inaudible)
chief

chief
justice
earl

was
that
--
that
was
while
he
was
suffering
these
intense
withdrawal
pains?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
being
questioned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
admission
that
he
made
mr.
hladis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
he
committed
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hladis,
what
--
what
is
your
response
to
mr.
leighton's
argument
on
these
other
murders
that
he
was
supposed
to
have
committed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this,
i
don't
know
if
that
bears
at
all,
but
you
said
there
were
some
10
people
who
were
hit
with
a
brick
in
this
way.
did
any
of
them
positively
identify
this
man
as
the
one
who
--
who
had
struck
him?
i
don't
know
that
it's
material
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
why
don't
--
why
don't
--
don't
bother.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
question

had

so
it's
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leighton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leighton,
may
i
ask
just
one
question
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
will
--
i'll
try
not
to
bother
you
the
rest
of
your
--
rest
of
your
time.
as
i
understand
that
the
theory
of
your
case
is
that
--
that
this
so
called
normal
dose,
if
it
--
if
it
was
a
normal
dose,
has
he
test
--
doctor
testified
at
one
time
in
the
--
in
the
proceedings
was
in
and
off
itself
sufficient
to
destroy
this
man's
resistance
to
--
to
question.
now,
if
we
accept
that
as
a
fact,
what
would
16
times
that
dose
do
to
--
to
him,
and
his
mind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
--
it
would
not
have
been
--
it
would
not
have
been
16
times,
that
normal
dose
would
not
have
been
enough
to
kill
him
or
to
paralyze
him
or
to
--
to
make
him
entirely
non-compos?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
not
have
done
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
--
who's
testifying?
who's
testifying
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
go
ahead,
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
was
that,
he
already
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
and
you
may
supply
any
such
memorandum
which
you
may
desire

chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leighton,
do
i
--
i
understand
you
took
this
case
by
assignment
from
a
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
would
thank
you
on
behalf
of
the
--
of
the
court
for
the
public
service
that
you
rendered
to
this
indigent
defendant.
we're
always
comforted
by
the
fact
that
lawyers
are
willing
to
undertake
such
assignments
and,
mr.
hladis,
i
want
to
thank
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
the
very
frank
manner
in
which
you
have
dealt
with
the
court
and
for
the
vigorous
manner
in
which
you
have
supported
the
judgment
to
be
heard
in
the
state
courts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.

mr.

chief

we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
petitioner
versus
frank
g.sain,
sheriff
of
cook
county.
mr.
leighton
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
he
represented
by
counsel
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leighton,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
understand
this
man
took
an
injection
of
this
narcotic
at
about
one
o'clock
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
earl
warren
approximately,
yes.
now,
when
normally
would
we
expect
--
could
we
expect
withdrawal
symptoms
to
develop
and
the
sickness
to
come
on
in.
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
will
last
for
how
long?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
the
fact
that
they
only
asked
him
few
questions
when
he
was
arrested
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
then
asked
him
no
questions
at
all
until
8:30
tonight
when
he
probably
would
be
within
--
with
all
the
symptoms.does
that
play
any
part
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leighton,
we
took
the
last
10
minutes
of
your
argument
with
questions
and
i'm
going
to
give
you
five
more
minutes
in
rebuttal
if
you
desire.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hladis.
and
you
may
--
mr.
hladis,
you
may
have
five
minutes
additional
if
you
should
desire
it
also.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
vital
in
this
case
in
the
posture
in
which
it
is
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
up
to
what
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
--
before
we
get
to
that,
what
have
you
to
say
about
mr.
leighton's
statement
that
the
other
police
officers,
cagney
and
others,
contradicted
this
police
officer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hladis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
see
some
place
where
the
doctor
left
some
other
medication
with
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
gave
instructions
to
take
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
midnight
and
he
took
it
almost
immediately?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
a
dispute
of
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hladis.
would
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mind
taking
just
a
moment
to
tell
us
about
these
other
crimes
of
this
man
confessed
at
that
time
where
according
to
counsel,
he
was
acquitted
to
one
--
and
another
the
victim
said
that
he
was
not
the
man
who
had
done
it
and
various
other
things.
would
you
mind
to
tell
us
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leighton.
