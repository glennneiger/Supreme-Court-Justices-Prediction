mr.
george
n.
leighton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
federal
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
our
federal
constitution
allows
the
state
of
illinois
to
inject
a
drug
into
petitioner
to
quiet,
sedate
him,
and
affect
his
mind,
and
then
use
a
confession
taken
from
him
while
he
is
under
the
drug
thus
injected
and
convict
him
of
murder.
this
court
has
granted
a
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
which
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
dismissing
an
application
for
habeas
corpus
under
the
federal
habeas
corpus
act,
was
affirmed.
illinois
proceedings
had
been
exhausted
by
the
petitioner
and
because
the
statement
of
the
historical
facts
will
necessarily
involve
a
discussion
of
all
the
procedural
questions,
i
will
go
directly
to
the
facts
that
give
rise
to
these
proceedings.
on
january
1,
1954,
the
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
there
was
a
review
of
the
complete
record
of
the
state
proceedings
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
none,
whatever.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
there
was
you
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
there
was.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
and
i
will
touch
upon
that
because
that
is
important
in
view
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
there
is
that
contention
your
honor.
there
is
that
contention.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well
in
the
question
presented,
if
your
honor
please,
we
stated
broad
enough
to
include
the
claim
we
had
made
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that
the
period
of
interrogation
was
excessive
in
view
of
the
injection
of
the
drug.
that
is,
if
i
may
say
again
your
honor,
that
is
the
position
of
the
petition
there
is
involved
in
this
case
and
within
the
question
presented.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
sure.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
they
are
--
they
are
different,
however
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no.
not
as
a
separate
claim
but
included
in
the
broad
question
presented
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
crucial
period
is
8:30
pm
of
january
1,
1954
and
11:15
pm,
that's
the
crucial
period.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
was
questioned
during
that
period.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
apparently
from
all
the
evidence
now
available
to
us,
he
was
questioned
in
sense
--
incisively
from
approximately
8:45
to
11:15
pm.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
not
quite
irrelevant.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
but
it's
not
quite
irrelevant
but
important
to
them.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
will
your
honor.
on
january
1,
1954
at
about
1:45
am
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes
there
is
your
honor
and
i
will
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes
there
is
and
i
will
touch
upon
that
part.
at
1:45
am,
on
the
morning
of
january
1,
1954,
this
petitioner
was
seen
walking
on
the
street
called
35th
street
in
the
city
of
chicago
by
four
police
officers
of
the
city
of
chicago.
there
appeared
to
have
been
a
man
named
vernon
campbell
who
incidentally
is
named
in
different
names
in
the
record,
vincent
campbell
or
vernon
campbell
and
i
believe
the
name
is
vernon,
who
had
been
in
custody
of
the
police
some
several
days
prior
to
january
1.
he
himself
had
been
in
custody
for
some
robbery
or
the
crime
and
by
the
time
of
his
testimony
in
this
case,
he
was
in
--
on
probation
from
a
conviction
of
the
crime
of
robbery.
now,
it's
also
fair
to
say
that
apparently
during
the
long
period
of
time
prior
to
january
1,
1954
in
this
particular
police
district,
they
had
been
found
several
men
dead,
all
with
similar
injuries
on
the
head
and
the
police
had
theorized
that
somewhere
in
this
police
district,
there
had
been
about
a
man
they
had
designated
as
the
house
brick
murder.
in
interrogating
campbell,
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
petitioner
here,
charles
townsend,
had
something
to
do
with
regard
to
these
murders.
and
with
campbell
to
identify
the
petitioner,
they
went
to
35th
indiana
at
about
1:45
am
on
new
years
day,
january
1,
1954
and
arrested
the
petitioner
in
the
company
of
another
man
whom
later
they
dismissed.
the
record
is
silent
as
to
what
they
did
with
this
other
man.
now,
your
honors
have
allowed
this
case
to
proceed
on
the
type
written
record
and
i
shall
make
express
reference
to
the
record
where
these
crucial
facts
appear
and
about
which
there
is
no
dispute.
townsend
was
taken
to
the
second
district
police
station
and
there
he
was
held
from
approximate
2:45
am
until
5
am,
and
there
is
nothing
important
that
occurred
between
1:45
am
and
8:30
pm
that
will
be
or
will
be
crucial
federal
question
presented
here
except
for
one
fact.
approximate
an
hour
and
a
half,
prior
to
the
time
that
townsend
was
arrested,
he
had
taken
a
large
injection
of
heroine
and
it
is
without
dispute
that
for
the
period,
from
the
time
that
he
was
15
years
of
age
until
the
time
relevant
here,
he
had
been
a
confirmed
narcotic
addict
and
this
fact
had
been
so
found
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
was
then
19
years
of
age.
the
fact
that
he
had
taken
this
injection
of
heroine
was
also
known
by
all
the
arresting
officers
because
he
had
told
them
that,
and
they
knew
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
this
heroine.
another
relevant
fact
within
this
period
to
be
stated,
there
was
no
dispute
that
townsend
at
that
time
was
of
subnormal
intelligence
and
upon
examination
by
a
prosecution
witness,
he
was
found
to
posses
an
iq
of
63
and
to
use
the
language
of
the
(inaudible)
to
examine
him,
he
was
using
an
old
form
of
characterization
near
moron
in
this
stage
of
psychiatric
examination
and
to
use
the
words
of
this
prosecution
witness,
he
was
a
near
mental
defective.
now,
between
approximately
5
am
on
the
morning
of
january
1,
1954
and
until
8:30
pm,
townsend
was
not
questioned.
he
was
held
in
custody
and
there
was
testimony
by
one
of
the
prosecution
witness
that
it
was
the
desire
of
the
police
officers
not
to
allow
him
to
come
in
contact
with
anyone.
and
so
they
transported
him
from
the
second
police
district
to
the
19th
police
district
for
reasons
best
known
to
police
consistent
with
this
plan
of
theirs
not
to
let
him
come
in
contact
with
anyone.
he
remained
at
the
19th
district
without
being
questioned
by
anyone
although
he
says
something
about
being
asked
some
questions,
but
of
the
purpose
of
this
case,
we
will
agree
that
he
was
not
questioned
by
anyone
and
he
remained
at
the
19th
district
until
about
8:30
pm
when
he
was
transferred
to
the
second
district
and
immediately
given
into
their
custody
of
the
same
four
police
officers
who
had
arrested
him.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
1:45
am
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
until
the
following
evening
8:30
pm.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
sir.
until
the
following
evening.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no
interrogation.
he
was
not
and
we
will
concede
in
the
course
of
this
argument,
no
one
questioned
him,
and
no
one
(inaudible)
him
in
anyway
and
he
remained
in
that
station
in
this
condition
without
being
bothered
except
that
he
was
held
in
custody
in
the
way
which
no
one
could
get
to
him,
friend,
counsel,
otherwise.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no
one
tried
and
for
the
purpose
of
clarifying
that
question,
mr.
justice
stewart,
this
petitioner
is
a
man
who
has
no
one.
now
at
about
8:30
pm,
he
was
brought
back
to
the
second
district
and
there
was
short,
very
common
in
police
practices
in
cook
county
and
townsend
was
put
in
the
company
of
three
other
men
to
be
viewed
by
a
man
named
anagnost,
who
had
been
the
victim
of
a
similar
incident
as
these
victims,
supposedly
have
been.
in
the
course
of
the
show-up,
anagnost
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
with
others
there.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
not
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
he
was
put
in
the
company
of
three
other
men
and
the
purpose
of
this
show-up
as
the
chicago
police
call
it,
is
to
allow
the
victim
of
robberies
otherwise
some
violence
to
pick
out
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
n.
leighton
we
have
no
grievance
about
that
your
honor.
there
is
a
significance
to
this
incident
which
will
touch
upon
this
confession
and
i
mention
it
now.
when
anagnost
was
there,
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
picking
the
assailant
in
accordance
with
the
theory
of
the
police
that
it
was
townsend,
but
when
anagnost
looked
over
this
line
up,
he
picked
out
a
man
who
was
not
townsend.
now,
it
is
significant
that
when
your
honors
requested
the
attorneys
for
the
respondent
to
file
an
additional
answer
to
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
there
was
attached
to
that
return,
that
additional
answer,
the
confession
of
charles
townsend
that
he
robbed
gus
anagnost.
it
is
in
fact
that
when
anagnost
picked
out
the
person
who
assaulted
him
with
a
brick,
he
picked
out
a
man
who
was
not
townsend.
now
until
this
moment,
until
the
show-up,
there's
nothing
to
indicate,
there's
nothing
with
townsend.
immediately
thereafter
however,
there
was
an
attempt
by
cagney,
one
of
the
arresting
officers
to
question
townsend
and
townsend
complained
to
him
that
he
couldn't
answer
any
question
because
he
was
then
in
the
throes
of
what
is
called
the
withdrawal
symptoms
of
the
narcotic
addict.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
8:30
--
8:45
pm
of
the
same
day.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
and
by
this
time,
he
was
in
the
withdrawal
symptom
and
dr.
mansfield
who
treated
him
has
described
the
physical
disability
of
a
narcotic
addict
in
the
withdrawal
symptom.
he
has
pains,
particularly
abdominal
pains,
he
sweats,
he
had
no
control
of
his
faculties,
he'
over
excited,
he
is
in
a
complete
misery.
and
cagney,
the
arresting
officer
described
his
condition
as
one
in
which
he
couldn't
count
how
many
times
this
petitioner
bent
over
and
wouldn't
answer
questions.
now,
there
is
a
quarrel
here
whether
it
was
townsend
who
said
to
cagney
“call
a
doctor”
or
whether
it
was
cagney's
idea.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
cagney
was
the
principal
and
the
most
active
police
officer
in
this
investigation.
it
is
clear,
however,
that
it
was
cagney
who
called
the
doctor
and
dr.
mansfield
so
testified,
officer
cagney
so
testified,
officer
martin
so
testified,
officer
fitzgerald
so
testified
and
so
did
corcoran.
cagney
then
called
dr.
mansfield
and
dr.
mansfield
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
sir?
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
he
was
trying
to
question
the
petitioner
but
the
petitioner
couldn't
answer
any
questions
and
the
petitioner
described
his
illness
and
he
saw
the
petitioner
bending
over
several
times
he
said
and
he
couldn't
count
the
number
of
times
that
the
petitioner
bent
over
and
so
he
--
he
then
called
the
doctor,
his
testimony
appearing
on
page
358
to
361
of
the
type
written
record.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
think
your
honor
has
the
wrong
impression
about
that
as
did
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh
well
you
got
the
right
impressions
from
what
they
said
but
the
record
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
--
is
not
correct
as
to
that.
it
was
cagney
who
called
the
doctor
and
it's
also
important
this
time
to
bear
in
mind
that
dr.
mansfield
was
an
employee
of
the
chicago
police
department.
he
was
as
he
described
himself
a
police
doctor
and
he
was
at
the
beck
and
call
of
the
chicago
police
department.
townsend
had
nothing
to
do
with
calling
mansfield
specifically.
what
can
be
said
from
the
evidence
is
that
when
townsend
in
this
--
in
this
fit
of
withdrawal
syndrome,
asked
for
some
help
and
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh
yes,
he
did
ask
and
he
did
--
and
there
was
--
there's
some
--
there's
evidence
here
from
which
one
could
conclude
that
in
this
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
in
this
colloquy
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
that's
the
fair
statement
and
then
it
was
cagney
who
decided
on
mansfield.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
selected
the
doctor,
you
see.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
townsend
asked
for
a
doctor
because
there
was
a
conversation
between
cagney
and
townsend
about
what
to
do
and
then
cagney
called
mansfield.
now
the
courts
below,
both
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
have
attached
a
great
of
importance
to
what
they
say,
is
in
the
record.
that
when
dr.
mansfield
came
into
the
police
station,
he
talked
with
no
one.
the
fact
is
the
record
is
clear
without
contradiction
that
when
he
came
to
the
station,
the
person
who
greeted
him
at
the
door
was
cagney
and
he
had
the
petitioner
there
in
this
particular
room.
now,
relevant
to
this
whole
inquiry,
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
record
shows
that
in
this
station
there
were
two
rooms,
a
room
which
they
called
the
center
room
and
a
room
called
the
south
room.
townsend
and
cagney
were
in
the
center
room.
the
state's
attorney
who
took
the
confession
was
in
the
south
room.
now,
it's
also
important
remember
that
at
this
point,
when
dr.
mansfield
came
into
the
station,
the
state's
attorney
who
was
there
to
take
the
confession
had
already
been
called
at
8:35
pm
and
i
point
to
you
honors
a
letter
written
by
mr.
janega
to
his
superiors,
in
his
own
language
saying
that
at
8:35
pm
of
january
1,
1954
he
had
been
called
to
the
second
district
in
connection
with
this
interrogation
of
townsend
and
he
had
made
the
necessary
arrangements
to
be
there
and
had
called
the
reporter
and
this
was
at
8:35
pm
and
this
according
to
the
un-contradicted
testimonial
of
prosecution
witnesses
was
before
the
show-up
and
before
the
doctor
had
been
called.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
layer
versus
deno?
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well
then
i'll
pause.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
your
honor
i
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
to
this
case
and
to
this
precise
question
you
just
asked,
and
i
submit
simply
this.
it
is
beyond
my
sense
of
comprehension
to
believe
that
an
experienced
police
officer
like
cagney
and
corcoran
who
were
part
of
the
homicide
section
of
chicago
police
department
would
call
a
doctor
to
the
police
station
to
inspect
and
examine
and
give
therapy
to
a
principal
witness
or
the
principal
suspect
to
clear
up
six
important
felonies
and
not
have
in
mind
some
relationship
between
the
administration
of
the
drug
and
the
consequence
that
was
reached.
we
due
respect
to
the
judgments
of
all
the
judges
below
who
apparently
don't
agree
with
me,
i
merely
submit
to
your
honor
in
answer
to
your
question
that
in
my
judgment,
a
fair
reading
of
this
record
is
that
the
calling
of
janega
at
8:35
pm,
the
selection
of
a
police
doctor,
the
presence
of
cagney
in
the
room,
the
injection
of
drug
without
anything
being
said
by
the
doctor
to
cagney,
a
doctor
who
later
said
he
had
never
seen
in
his
life
any
truth
serum,
scopolamine
although
he
treated
him
with
hyoscine
which
according
to
all
the
pharmacological
opinion
in
this
country
and
in
europe
is
a
drug
which
is
administered
in
the
cases
of
criminal
investigation
for
the
purpose
of
taking
confessions.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
they
are
the
same
drug
with
a
different
names
and
i
will
touch
upon
that
question
because
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
sure.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
see
how
any
other
conclusion
can
be
reached
from
all
the
facts
than
that.
for
the
simple
reason
that
cagney
knew
his
condition
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
and
--
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
cagney
as
was
well-acquainted
with
mansfield
as
mansfield
was
with
the
general
subject
of
narcotic
addicts
in
the
withdrawal
symptom.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes
your
honor,
there
is.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
in
the
record,
there
is
testimony
like
cagney
himself
that
he
knew
at
the
time
that
he
arrested
townsend.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
was
an
addict.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
--
and
that
he
had
--
he
had
taken
the
injection
and
he
knew
that
he
was
a
narcotic
addict.
he
knew
he
had
taken
the
injection
you
see,
and
my
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
that
since
he
knew
all
these
facts
and
since
he
knew
from
his
experience
of
many
years
of
the
consequences
of
heroine
injection
in
a
narcotic
addict,
that
there
was
a
fair
inference
from
all
of
this
that
he
knew
also
the
--
the
other
parts
of
the
whole
question.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
drug
given
by
the
doctor?
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
the
answer
is
yes
and
i'll
--
and
i'll
now
say
why.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
dr.
mansfield's
testimony
and
it
will
appear
on
pages
210
of
the
record
to
2
-
251
of
the
type
written
record.
he
testified
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
on
the
suppression
of
the
confession
that
he
gave
this
petitioner
a
dosage
consisting
of
1/8
grain
of
phenobarbital
together
with
what
he
said
was
one-half
hyoscine
and
he
defined
that
mean
1/230
grain
of
hyoscine.
now,
that's
what
he
said
when
the
motion
suppressed
was
heard.
however,
in
the
case-in-chief,
when
dr.
mansfield
testified
and
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
his
testimony
that
is
found
on
page
3
--
correction,
page
981
to
991
of
the
record.
there,
he
said
that
he
gave
him
1/8
of
gram
of
phenobarbital
and
1/230
of
a
gram
of
hyoscine.
now,
if
you
honors
please,
that
is
16
times
more
drug
than
this
doctor
had
testified
before
the
judge
because
a
gram
contains
15.432
grains
and
roughly
in
drug
palettes,
a
gram
has
approximately
16
times
more
drug
than
a
grain.
now,
before
the
judge
and
i
again
call
your
honors'
attention
that
only
once,
only
once
in
this
doctor's
testimony
that
he
defined
and
that
appears
on
215
on
the
record,
only
once
did
he
say
that
he
administered
1/230
of
a
grain
of
hyoscine.
now
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
it
is
generally
agreed
by
all
pharmacological
experts,
both
in
this
country
and
in
europe,
that
the
therapeutic
dose
of
hyoscine
within
the
normal
range
that
will
not
completely
paralyze
an
individual
is
between
1/200
of
a
grain
and
1/100
of
a
grain.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
of
a
grain.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
a
grain
you
see
and
this
--
this
--
this
expert
that
the
courts
below
had
lauded
in
this
way
testified
before
the
judge
that
he
gave
him
1/230
of
a
grain,
but
before
the
jury
he
said
that
he
gave
him
1/230
of
gram
and
his
testimony
appears
on
the
pages
i
just
called
your
honor's
attention.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
was
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
none
was
made
strongly
a
bit
and
i
can
only
attribute
this
to
the
fact
that
no
one
stopped
to
do
the
mathematical
computation
to
determine
that
there
are
15.432
grains
in
a
gram
and
it
was
left
over
very
easily
but
it's
repeated,
his
testimony
repeated
again
on
pages
987
to
991
of
the
record
and
again,
he
was
talking
of
grams
and
not
grains.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
except
this
your
honor,
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
instructions
given
to
this
jury,
those
instructions
didn't
touch
at
all
upon
this
important
pharmacological
question?
mr.
george
n.
leighton
your
honor
i
cannot
answer
that
question
because
i
didn't
try
the
case
and
i'm
only
looking
at
the
record
as
it's
now
is
formed
and
at
the
time
when
this
record
was
put
up,
at
that
time,
we
didn't
have
the
rule
we
know
have
in
illinois
that
all
of
the
instruction
must
be
in
the
abstract.
now,
i
might
add
also
your
honor
that
in
the
course
of
reviewing
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
this
precise
question
was
not
analyzed
as
carefully
as
i
am
analyzing
it
here.
but
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
if
you
look
at
the
instructions
given
to
the
jury
and
you
look
at
the
testimony,
you
will
see
that
actually
the
import
and
the
importance
of
this
drug
didn't
occur
to
anybody
in
that
case
except
insofar
as
mr.
branion,
the
public
defendant
by
instinct
of
his
long
experience
had
dr.
proctor
to
testify
about
the
drug.
and
i
suggest
to
you
most
respectively,
if
you
look
at
dr.
proctor's
testimony
unfortunately,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
heart
of
the
important
constitution
question
which
we
are
now
confronted,
namely
did
this
drug,
why
is
this
drug
sufficient,
not
only
to
create
amnesia
or
loss
of
memory,
but
did
it
affect
his
will
power.
but
the
evidence
in
the
record,
when
looked
at
against
the
accepted
pharmacological
expert
opinion,
by
which
this
evidence
must
be
judged,
is
that
this
man
was
given
according
to
this
doctor's
own
testimony
for
the
jury,
16
times
more
drugs
than
is
recognized
as
a
therapeutic
dose.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well
not
as
carefully
as
i'm
doing
it
here.
if
we
argued
it,
for
instance
i
was
appointed
to
represent
this
petitioner,
when
he
was
sentenced
to
death.
i
argued
this
question
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
the
involuntariness
of
this
confession.
but
the
actual
analysis
of
this
drug
in
the
fashion
i'm
doing
it
now,
i
have
no
independent
recollection
of
having
done
it
because
at
that
time,
the
argument
was,
was
this
a
voluntary
confession
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
the
drug.
and
that
is
why
when
your
honors
denied
certiorari,
we
went
back
and
filed
a
post-conviction
petition
in
the
hope,
in
the
course
of
the
state
proceedings
and
the
petitioner
is
here
now,
in
the
course
of
the
post-conviction
petition,
i
would
then
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
demonstrated
to
the
trial
judge
that
the
very
drug
that
had
been
told
him
was
a
normal
therapy
for
narcotic
addicts
and
the
withdrawal
system
was
in
fact
a
powerful
mediatric
that
paralyzes
the
eye
muscles,
causes
amnesia,
the
loss
of
the
--
of
the
this
limb
because
hyoscine
is
said
to
be
an
autonomic
blocking
agent.
it
had
the
capacity
to
separate
the
central
nervous
system
from
the
ordinary
organs
of
the
human
body.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
was
not
your
honor
and
the
reason
for
that
was
this.
the
position
taken
by
the
state's
attorney
was
that
the
decision
on
writ
of
error
was
res
judicata
and
the
substance
of
the
supreme
court
opinion
on
that
was
that
all
these
questions
had
been
decided.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
what
they
--
that's
all
i
understood
your
honor.
they
said
that
because
we
have
doctor
and
new
lawyer
at
criminal
law
that
if
a
writ
of
error
proceedings
have
instituted
and
completed,
all
the
questions
which
could
have
been
raised
are
taken
within
the
scope
of
writ
of
error
and
the
--
the
--
the
substance
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
on
the
post-conviction
petition
was
to
tell
me
that
all
these
questions
you're
now
raising,
we
decided
it
anyway.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
but
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
but
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
post-conviction
petition
and
the
affidavits
of
this
petitioner,
the
post-conviction
--
was
much
broader
than
this
narrow
conclusion
reached
by
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
the
state's
attorney.
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
a
post-conviction
and
petition
had
the
same
effect
as
any
motion
to
dismiss,
affirmative
allegations
of
petition
appealing
and
the
motion
dismissed
by
the
state's
attorney
was
sustained
and
then
i
took
a
write
of
error
to
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
then
they
wrote
this
memorandum
opinion.
now,
i
may
pause
here
to
say
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
if
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
in
the
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
but
the
habeas
corpus
application
contained
all
those
allegations.
in
our
habeas
corpus
petition,
all
these
facts
were
alleged
including
the
--
the
reliance
upon
this
doctrine
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
we
raised
that
question
in
the
--
in
the
habeas
corpus
application
and
that
is
one
of
my
--
my
complaints
about
the
dismissal
of
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
heroin,
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
may
i
say
your
honor.
when
i
said
a
moment
ago,
there's
nothing
crucial.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
was
questioned
just
briefly
and
then
he
was
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
the
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
only
testimony,
the
only
evidence
is
the
testimony
of
dr.
mansfield
who
claimed
some
familiarity
with
the
matter,
he
diagnosed
the
petitioner
and
found
he
was
suffering
from
withdrawal
symptoms,
and
his
testimony
appears
first
on
page
214
of
the
type
written
record
and
again
on
pages
--
beginning
with
the
pages
of
975
of
the
record
before
the
jury
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
question
to
mind
of
dr.
mansfield
that
this
petitioner
was
suffering
a
normal
withdrawal
symptom
reaction
at
the
time
he
examined
him.
and
i
assume
from
this
that
the
time
that
he
reacted
in
this
fashion
is
the
normal
time
to
be
expected
from
a
self-inflicted
injection,
say
about
12:00
or
the
day
before,
you
see.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
about
20
hours
and
no
one
seemed
to
question
--
there
seemed
to
be
no
dispute
here
that
this
petitioner
was
in
the
withdrawal
symptom
and
that
it
was
normal
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yeah.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
now,
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
it
would.
but
may
i
say
your
honor?
if
i
made
a
quote
some
words
you
uttered
recently
that
to
a
man
in
prison,
and
i
may
paraphrase
it,
it
makes
no
difference
to
him
whose
liberty
is
taken
that
is
a
result
of
a
professional
incompetence
or
professional
malice.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
record
carefully
as
your
honor
observed
recently,
one
who's
held
in
secret
custody
can
never
prove
by
evidence
which
we
otherwise
would
take
us
persuasive,
what
took
place
behind
the
closed
door,
one
of
the
vices
of
secrete
interrogation.
now
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
now
your
honor,
that
the
point
that
i
can't
escape
about
this
case
is
this
and
it
occurred
to
me,
i
don't
want
to
sound
fictitious,
but
you
see
although
this
was
new
year's
day,
this
was
not
a
party
celebrating
new
year
with
charley
townsend.
they
were
there
for
this
whole
purpose
and
this
was
the
purpose
of
everybody
concerned
on
new
year's
day
at
the
second
police
district.
the
reporter,
he
wasn't
there
admitted
to
record
celebration
of
new
year
festivities.
he
was
there
to
record
a
confession.
if
there
wasn't
a
confession,
anticipated,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
not
sinister
your
honor,
but
merely
indicative
of
what
was
in
mind
of
all
persons
concerned
you
see.
now,
when
the
doctor
is
called,
this
was
not
an
act
of
humane
kindness
towards
charley
townsend.
they
wanted
charley
townsend
to
get
out
to
this
distress
condition
so
he
could
answer
questions.
in
fact,
mr.
janega
testified
and
his
testimony
is
in
the
record
without
contradiction
that
when
he
first
saw
townsend,
townsend
would
not
answer
question
because
he
couldn't.
his
testimony
appearing
on
page
439
of
the
type
written
record
in
on
and
that
he
asked
the
officer
to
get
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
said
--
i
mean
the
officer
said
--
cagney
said,
“i've
already
called
the
doctor.”
my
point
is
this.
if
you
look
at
what
was
going
on
and
fit
it
into
the
scheme
of
what
was
the
objectives
in
mind
of
all
these
polices
officers
and
public
officials,
they
only
had
one
thing
in
mind
to
extract
by
interrogation,
questions
that
will
clear
up
these
unsolved
felonies.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
may
i
say
this
your
honor.
the
courts
below
have
taken
the
view
that
it
was
not
a
concocted
arrangement.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
totality
of
circumstances
that
the
only
thing
they
were
there
for
was
to
take
a
confession
from
charlie
townsend.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
that's
the
point.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
the
point
--
that's
of
the
brief.
now
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
sure
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no.
that's
whole
part
of
the
whole
trial
proceedings.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
can
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh
yes,
they're
here.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
they
are
here.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
record
is
here.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
specific
pages.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
everything
is
here,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
i
wanted
an
opportunity
since
the
--
the
illinois
courts
had
denied
the
petition
of
that
opportunity,
i
want
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
the
very
thing
i'm
arguing
here
that
this
was
not
a
normal
--
this
was
not
a
normal
therapy
of
narcotic
addict
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
and
also
--
also
you
honor,
the
point
that
i
have
had
difficulty
putting
over
to
anybody
in
this
case
that
the
failure
of
the
trial
judge
to
have
been
adequately
informed
that
this
was
not
a
pharmacological
drug
called
hyoscine
which
the
doctors
use
for
certain
kind
of
treatment.
this
was
a
drug
which
in
both
medical
and
criminological
tolerance
was
known
as
the
truth
serum.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
was
not.
it
was
sought
to
be
pursued
in
a
post-conviction
proceeding
and
denied.
now,
may
i
say
this
so
the
court
may
understand
the
position
of
petitioner?
we
take
the
position
that
when
you
look
at
the
records
before
the
district
judge,
if
we
look
at
the
testimony
carefully,
the
district
court
erred
in
denying
habeas
corpus
because
if
you
properly
function
as
your
honors
have
said
brown
versus
allen,
it
was
duty
to
do
so,
if
he
had
made
the
findings
which
he
should
have
made,
he
would
have
perceived,
what
i
am
saying
to
your
honors
here
and
what
i
was
trying
to
say
to
the
court
of
appeals
below
that
it
was
error
to
dismiss
that
petition
because
it
was
obvious
from
all
of
the
evidence
that
the
state
courts
had
misconceived
the
federal
constitutional
of
rights
of
this
petitioner.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
in
the
post-conviction
petition
and
that
is
--
that's
not
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
in
the
trial
court?
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh,
i
meant
to
say
your
honor
that
i
--
before
the
district
judge
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus,
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
i
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
because
the
district
judge
was
to
rule
on
the
question
whether
he
was
to
allow
the
petitioner
a
hearing.
he
never
--
we
never
got
to
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
in
the
brief
--
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
there
is
a
reporter
proceeding
before
judge
igoe
and
the
memorandum
opinion
of
judge
igoe
in
which
he
overruled
petitioner's
request
for
a
hearing,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
and
that
is
the
(inaudible)
capital
a,
in
the
record,
it's
in
the
typewritten
record,
with
capital
a
and
on
the
reporter
proceeding.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i'm
referring
to
the
portion
of
the
record
marked
capital
f
and
there's
a
reporter
proceeding
containing
the
request
for
rehearing
before
judge
igoe.
that's
the
portion
that
i
have
reference
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
we
referred
to
it
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
in
the
argument
portion,
and
i'm
trying
to
find
it
now
because
this
is
part
of
the
point
i
make
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
petitioner
did
not
carry
the
burden
of
proof
and
i
argue
the
point
that
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof
means
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
that
was
foreclosed
by
the
ruling
of
the
district
judge.
he
wouldn't
hear
petitioner.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
if
i
may
have
just
a
moment.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
on
page
25,
on
page

citing
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
i
make
specific
reference
on
page
26
to
record
portion
capital
f,
transcript
of
proceedings
of
june
12,
1959
pages
2-31
and
64
and
the
memorandum
order
of
june
24,
1959
in
which
the
district
court
ruled
that
petitioner
would
not
be
heard
and
that
he
was
going
to
pass
on
the
matter
of
solely
the
state
court
records
and
he
did.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
these
are
here
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
they
are
in
typed
form.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
never
was
given
a
chance.
we
never
got
to
the
point
where
the
offer
of
proof
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
i
pointed
out
to
him
in
the
course
of
the
argument
various
times
with
period
and
in
the
brief
we
filed
in,
incidentally
justice
harlan,
the
brief
that
we
filed
before
the
district
judge
is
here
and
that
point
is
urged
upon
the
district
judge.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
because
i
never
got
to
that
point.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
--
that's
right.
i
never
made
the
proffer.
that
is
correct.
now,
i
like
to
just
in
closing
with
the
time
allowed
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes
your
honor,
we
did.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
first
time,
we
appeared
before
judge
he
dismissed
the
petition
summarily.
we
came
before
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh
yes,
there
were
arguments.
he
wouldn't
listen
at
all.
we
came
before
this
court
and
your
honors
vacated
to
judge
igoe's
dismissal
of
the
petition
because
he
had
not
followed
jennings
versus
ragan.
and
upon
the
vacature
of
that
first
order
of
dismissal,
we
went
back
before
judge
igoe,
i
then
argued
before
judge
igoe
and
that
is
shown
in
the
report
of
proceedings
mr
--
i'm
sorry,
i
forgot
it,
mr.
hladis
had
just
handed
to
me.
i
then
argued
before
judge
igoe
that
we
were
entitled
to
plenary
hearing
with
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
including
witnesses.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
mean
that
i
requested
it
in
terms
of
motion,
i
requested
it
then
in
argument
against
the
state's
attorney
motion
to
dismiss
the
petition
a
second
time.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
sir?
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
and
he
wouldn't
go
to
that
point.
he
finally
ruled
one
day
after
we
--
audit
before
him
that
he
had
read
this
state
court
records
and
he
issued
memorandum
on
it
and
he
passed
specifically
on
the
request
for
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
in
the
memorandum
order
of
june
24,
he
specifically
passed
on
that
request.
at
that
point
you
see,
i
not
had
been
given
a
chance
to
be
heard,
having
urged
for
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
knowing
what
witnesses
i
have
to
produce
but
being
denied
the
opportunity,
we
then
took
the
appeal
which
is
now
before
your
honors.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
it
is
important.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor
and
then
made
no
specific
findings
of
fact
or
law.
thank
you.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
thank
you
your
honor.
i
have
--
had
portion
of
the
time
remaining
to
me
now,
so
i
can
take
another
additional
12
minutes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
to
conclude
the
argument
for
the
petitioner
if
your
honor
please,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
position
of
the
petitioner
is
that
before
the
district
court,
the
attorneys
for
the
respondents
had
upon
remandment
of
this
course,
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
petition
again
and
the
case
never
got
beyond
argument
on
that
motion,
and
that
motion
was
sustained
by
the
district
judge
by
his
memorandum
order
from
which
the
appeal
was
taken
so
that
at
no
time
was
the
petitioner
allowed
the
opportunity
which
is
ordinary
available
at
a
trial
of
an
issue
to
make
a
formal
offer
of
proof.
now
we
take
the
position
that
the
district
judge
heard
in
dismissing
the
petition
and
not
performing
the
functions
which
your
honors
have
said
is
the
inherent
duty
of
a
district
judge
on
federal
habeas
corpus,
to
have
made
his
own
independent
determination
of
the
question
whether
the
federal
constitutional
questions
which
the
petitioner
had
urged
in
the
district
court
had
been
fairly
considered
and
determined
by
the
state
courts.
now,
i
wish
you
to
also
go
back
to
question
which
has
been
asked
of
me
about
the
position
of
the
petitioner
with
regard
to
the
effect
of
this
drug.
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
vice
of
what
occurred
to
him
was
that
while
he
was
given
a
drug
by
a
police
doctor,
he
was
also
at
the
same
time,
while
still
under
the
influence
of
this
drug,
subjected
to
the
interrogation
that
resulted
in
the
confession
used
in
this
trial.
the
courts
below
have
failed
to
distinguish
between
the
propriety
of
the
medication
and
the
propriety
of
the
interrogation,
while
the
medication
may
well
be
in
the
mind
to
some
people,
some
doctors
had
been
proper
that
the
interrogation
accompanied
at
the
same
time
while
he
was
under
the
influence
of
this
police
injected
drug,
is
what
creates
the
vice.
now,
the
petitioner
can
only
point
to
the
fair
inferences
in
the
record
that
this
was
the
intended
result
by
the
state
officers
involved.
it
is
true,
we
have
no
one
who
could
testify
that
officer
cagney,
when
he
saw
the
doctor,
talked
to
the
doctor
and
said
“give
him
a
drug
that
will
produce
confession”
is
true,
but
it
is
considered
judgment
of
pharmacologist,
the
people
who
have
dealt
with
the
therapeutic
and
the
physiological
results
of
hyoscine,
criminologists
have
spoken
on
the
subject,
medical
men
have
spoken
on
the
subject
that
this
drug
has
properties
which
injected
in
therapeutic
doses
produced
the
state
of
mind
of
ejecting
in
incriminatory
confessions
and
in
fact
that
is
one
of
the
uses
of
the
drug.
now,
it
occurred
to
me
to
say,
if
your
honors
please
that
fair
minds
would
agree
that
if
man
were
being
wheeled
into
operating
room
with
proper
therapeutic
doses
of
chloroform
and
other
means
of
easing
his
pains,
that
is
not
the
time
to
discuss
with
him
the
disposition
of
his
property.
most
people
would
argue
i'm
sure
that
a
will
signed
by
man
who
was
about
to
be
taken
into
an
operating
room
is
not
a
valid
exercise
of
testamentary
power.
so
that
while
the
medication
might
have
been
proper
under
the
circumstances,
it
is
the
accompanying
interrogation
with
the
resulting
confession,
that
raises
the
question
here.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
now,
may
i
just
answer
your
honor's
question
that
are
very
important
that
i'm
sorry
i
won't
be
able
to
dwell
upon
it.
i
urged
that
question
before
the
district
judge.
i
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
introduce
in
evidence
the
fact
that
on
january
4,
when
they
had
a
coroner's
hearing
which
i
have
sometimes
describe
that
charlie
townsend
day
because
that's
what
they
had
that
day.
it
was
hearings
on
charlie
townsend
cases,
they
had
inquest
into
four
deaths,
one
with
the
death
of
johnny
stinson.
in
and
around,
charlie
townsend
were
later
found
items
of
property
of
this
deceased.
they
took
a
confession
from
townsend,
at
the
same
time,
they
took
this
one.
the
case
was
tried.
townsend
was
acquitted
because
townsend
adequately
explained
evidently
the
presence
of
these
articles.
there
was
another
inquest
in
which
the
--
another
confession
was
taken
at
the
same
time,
this
one
was
taken.
the
inquest
reports
are
now
before
your
honors
as
part
of
the
additional
answer
of
the
respondents.
in
that
inquest
concerning
death
to
this
man,
he
was
testified
by
the
sister
of
the
deceased
that
when
the
deceased
was
found
and
his
sister
asked
him,
“what
happen
to
you
willis?”
willis
thompson
said
it
was
just
one
of
those
things.
it
was
an
accident.
when
the
doctor
questioned
him
and
when
the
police
questioned
thompson,
thompson
said
i
had
an
accident.
and
as
i
have
argued
in
the
reply
to
the
additional,
to
try
best
to
judicial
answer,
i
don't'
know
how
in
this
earth
can
an
accident
be
made
into
murder,
just
because
the
petitioner
while
he
was
under
the
influence
of
a
drug
admitted
something
about
the
murder
and
you
can
look
at
the
confession.
the
confession
is
not
even
admission
to
be
having
to
do
with
it.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
those
are
--
those
documents
themselves
never
were
offered
your
honor.
what
was
done
was
to
bring
by
inference
in
the
trial
that
at
the
inquest,
they
were
other
crimes
involved.
as
your
honor
can
well
understand,
a
defense
lawyer
who's
defending
a
man
for
one
murder
where
the
issue
is
question
of
guilt,
he
would
by
every
instinct
in
the
lawyer
object
to
such.
it
is
a
different
question,
if
your
honor
please,
in
a
habeas
corpus
case.
in
the
habeas
corpus,
the
guilt
of
the
defendant
is
not
involved.
the
petitioner
is
not
on
trial.
it
is
the
constitutional
question
in
the
habeas
corpus
case.
i
thought
it
relevant
to
show
that
when
he
gave
this
serious
of
six
confessions,
one
he
was
found
not
guilty,
one
man
who
was
killed
said
that
he
had
an
accident,
the
third
one
if
may
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
officer
was
asked
by
the
deputy
coroner
to
sit
down
because
he
said
you're
trying
to
make
his
man
admit
something
he
didn't
do
and
he
said
to
the
coroner,
“what
are
we
going
to
do?
we
have
to
clean
up
these
records
somehow.”
and
i
say
to
your
honors
that
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
to
start
off
the
new
year
with
a
clean
slate
and
they
were
using
this
petitioner
as
a
mop
to
clean
up
unsolved
murders
and
felonies
in
their
particular
police
district.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
that's
because
your
honor
it
happens
at
the
two
different
judges
were
deciding.
in
the
habeas
corpus
case,
the
judge
who
--
have
heard
this
additional
confessions
was
not
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
deciding
the
guilt
of
the
defendant.
that's
the
reason.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well
because
it
happens
that
the
two
judges
were
functioning
in
slightly
different
positions.
that's
the
only
reason.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
is
true
your
honor.
there
is
no
--
but
the
whole
point
arises
you
see
is
in
the
some
fortunate
posture
in
which
the
issues
arise.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
except
that
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding
your
honor,
we
made
the
same
offer
and
we
could
have
been
heard
there
and
they
wouldn't
--
they
wouldn't
hear
the
petitioner
in
that
case
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
may
i
make
it
clear
your
honor
that
the
confessions
themselves
never
were
offered.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
now,
just
to
touch
the
point
again
your
honor,
may
i
call
your
attention
to
fact
so
that
we
may
not
mislead.
i
think
it
fair
to
say
that
in
the
hearing
before
judge
butler
on
the
motion
to
suppressed,
there
was
enough
of
that
evidence
that
is
on
that
evidence
before
the
judge
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
there
was
enough
said
so
that
the
judge
knew
that
at
that
coroner
inquest,
there
was
more
than
one
particular
crime
involved.
i
think
that's
fair.
now,
may
i
just
conclude
now
with
this
final
thought
if
i
may
your
honor?
one
of
the
most
persuasive
facets
of
this
record
is
the
fact
that
when
rudolph
janega,
the
assistant
state's
attorney
began
questioning
this
petitioner,
he
had
to
stop
because
the
petitioner
could
not
answer
the
question.
the
record
is
without
impeachment
from
the
testimony
of
the
prosecution
witnesses
that
as
the
doctor
was
being
led
out
one
door,
the
petitioner
was
being
led
into
the
other
room
where
janega
was
waiting.
we
now
know
from
the
pet
--
respondents
themselves
that
at
ten
minutes
after
ten,
they
took
the
first
confession.
i
invite
your
honor's
attention
to
the
confession
in
question,
particularly
the
question
that
was
asked
by
this
interrogator
after
townsend
was
asked,
“what
did
you
take
from
the
pocket
of
this
man?”
he
said,
“money.”
“what
else,”
indicating
to
anyone
who
fairly
reads
that
confession,
that
the
interrogator
knew
enough
facts
either
prior
interrogation
of
this
petitioner
or
from
some
of
the
source
that
was
something
else.
there
is
another
crucial
point
involved
in
this
confession
that
this
wallet
of
this
deceased
was
allegedly
found
at
the
street
called
37th
place.
when
mr.
janega
asked
this
petitioner,
“where
were
you
on
the
night
in
question,”
and
he
said,
“36th
street.”
another
question
was
put
to
him
plainly
indicating
that
mr.
janega
knew
that
the
wallet
was
found
on
37th
place
by
correcting
him.
he
offered
the
suggestion
of
37th
place.
you
can
read
the
confession
and
see
it.
now,
strangely
enough,
this
wretch,
this
man
who
couldn't
answer
questions,
no
sooner
had
he
been
giving
this
drug
when
he
exaggerated
six
incriminatory
confessions
which
are
now
part
of
the
record
which
your
honor
thought
sufficient
to
ask
the
respondents
to
file
with
you
as
answers
to
the
--
to
the
habeas
corpus
petition.
and
the
only
thing
that
could
have
brought
this
miraculous
result
was
this
drug,
this
powerful
mydriatic
that
paralyzes
the
eye
muscles
as
described
by
this
petitioner,
that
separates
the
connection
between
the
central
nervous
system
and
the
organs
of
the
human
body
and
thus
subdues
the
will
to
an
interrogator
who
wants
answers
incriminatory
as
shown
by
the
experience
of
police
systems,
the
world
over.
and
on
these
grounds,
we
say
that
this
confession
was
involuntary
and
as
your
honor
said
recently
whether
it
was
the
result
of
professional
incompetence
or
official
malice,
the
right
impinged
upon
is
just
as
sensitive
whether
it's
intent
or
would
be
the
consequence
which
follows
when
a
confession
is
taken
to
take
human
life.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
may
i
assist,
it's
on
page

you'll
find
the
testimony

mr.

of
the

mr.

649
to

mr.
george
n.
leighton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
clarify
the
question
concerning
office
of
corcoran's
testimony.
it
has
been
gone
into,
i'll
touch
upon
that
briefly.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it,
it
would
have
produced
the
kind
of
amnesia
condition
which
he
himself
described
as
i
understand
from
the
pharmaceutical
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
would
not
have
done
that,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
not
from
my
knowledge
of
the
subject.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
--
there
is
in
the
record,
luckily,
for
us,
there
is
in
the
record,
in
the
typewritten
proceedings
in
the
district
--
in
the
trial
court,
there
is,
luckily,
on
pages
--
i
like
to
find
it
exactly,
at
the
last
part
of
the
typewritten
record,
there
was
a
tender
of
proof
made
concerning
the
effects
of
hyoscine
and
the
therapeutic
dose.
and
those
pages
are
pages
1187
to
pages
1191
and
the
therapeutic
dose
of
hyoscine
is
given
there
and
incidentally
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
was
a
ca
--
in
the
instance
in
which
this
--
the
defense
attorney,
mr.
branion,
read
out
of
a
book
he
had
in
his
hands
which
is
--
was
considered
by
him
as
being
authoritative.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
find
that
portion
of
the
record
consistent
with
the
authorities
that
we
relied
upon
concerning
this
drug
and
i
might
say
to
your
honors
that
according
to
my
research,
the
outstanding
pharmaceutical
authority
in
this
field
is
goodman
&
gilmore.
we
have
cited
that
and
my
inquire
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
goodman
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
goodman
&
gilman
and
the
name
of
the
book
is
“the
pharmacological
basis
of
therapeutics.”
i
am
advised
by
doctors
and
pharmacologists
that
goodman
&
gilman
is
considered
the
bible
of
pharmacologists
and
doctors
in
this
particular
field.
and
they
give
a
very
nice
description
of
the
effects
of
hyoscine,
its
history,
its
use
and
how
it's
been
used
both
in
therapy
and
in
criminal
investigation
and
this
portion
of
the
record
is
consistent
with
goodman
&
gilman.
it's
consistent
with
the
other
authorities
we've
cited
and
relied
upon,
the
british
pharmacopoeia,
the
epiphany
of
--
of
pharmacopoeia
of
the
united
states,
(inaudible)
henry,
“the
plant
alkaloids”
and
other
which
appear
in
the
index
to
our
brief.
i
found
it
necessary
to
add
an
appendix
to
this
brief,
which,
i
think,
is
an
answer
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
literature
on
the
use
of
hyoscine
and
scopolamine
in
criminal
investigation
both
in
this
country
and
in
europe.
and
that
appendix
appears
on
pages
33,
35
of
our
brief
and
it
is
by
no
means
exhaustive.
scopolamine
has
been
used
in
taking
confessions
from
persons
in
arrest
beginning
around
1922.
and
the
article
which
is
most
informative
on
this
subject
is
an
article
that
appears
in
the
18th
texas
state
law
of
general
medicine,
page
231,
published
in
1922
which
gives
the
experience
of
a
doctor
in
texas
whose
name
escapes
me
right
at
this
moment
but
who
was
the
origin
--
who
really
originated
the
idea
of
the
use
of
hyoscine
and
scopolamine
in
criminal
investigations.
it
was
he
who
discovered
that
upon
the
injection
of
a
sufficient
dose
of
hyoscine
to
a
woman
in
the
birth
stage,
she
lost
contact
with
the
actual
functions
of
the
ovary
muscles
and
other
portions
of
the
female
body
that
gave
birth
to
children
and
it
put
her
in
what
was
then
colloquially
described
as
“twilight
sleep”
so
as
to
aid
the
birth
process
without
pain.
that
use
had
been
discontinued
medically
because
it
has
other
deleterious
effects
on
women
and
--
and
that
has
been
the
history
of
the
drug
in
that
regard.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
i
was
going
to
go
back
to
officer
corcoran's
testimony.
and
i
wish
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
is
true
because
the
--
the
success
--
to
me,
there
was
successful,
if
your
honor
please,
it
also
had
other
effects.
the
--
the
drug
had
other
effects.
for
example,
in
some
cases,
it
would
put
the
subject
into
delirium
and
the
presence
of
pain
and
many
other
physiological
factors
were
important.
it
isn't
--
it
hasn't
been
successful
but
there
was
an
intensive
investigation
and
experiment
into
this
field
and
it
was
thought
at
the
time,
they
had
an
answer
to
criminal
investigation.
there
were
some
people
who
thought
it
was
really
the
answer
to
the
whole
subject.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
french
used
it
and
we
cite
(inaudible)
mr.
george
n.
leighton
--
drugs
under
mind.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
fairly
correct.
they
experiment
a
great
deal
about
it.
(inaudible)
gagnieur,
the
judicial
views
of
psych
--
psychoanalysis
and
--
psychonarcosis
in
france,
extensive
literature
on
the
subject
and
the
use
of
the
word
“truth
serum”
came
out
of
this
--
this
period
of
--
of
history
of
the
drug.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
the
reason
why
the
experiment
thought
to
be
unreliable.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
and
it
would
produce
halluci
--
it
produces
hallucinations
in
the
subject
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
--
so
that
the
product
was
not
reliable.
now,
i
did
want
to
touch
upon
officer
corcoran,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
think
it's
important.
i
called
your
honors'
the
fact
this
trial
to
two
parts,
the
hearing
to
suppress
and
before
the
jury.
officer
corcoran
testified
on
the
hearing
to
suppress
then
his
testimony
appears
in
the
typewritten
record
on
pages
465
and
to
the
end
of
this
cross-examination
on
page
495
of
the
typewritten
record
and
i
invite
your
honors'
attention
to
significant
fact
at
no
time
did
he
say
anything
about
hearing
townsend
make
an
admission.
it
wasn't
until
he
testified
in
the
case
in
chief
that
suddenly,
quite
surprising
to
the
defense
counsel
and
it's
in
the
record,
on
pages
644
onward,
that
he,
for
the
first
time,
mentioned
that
he
heard
townsend
say
to
cagney,
“not
that
i
killed
jack
boone.”
he
heard
cagney
--
he's
heard
townsend
say
to
cagney
that
he
--
he
struck
a
man
in
a
passageway
on
38th
street
in
michigan.
for
the
first
time
before
the
jury,
corcoran
testified.
now,
your
honors,
i
submit
either
that
he
had
never
heard
that
testimony
or
someone
thought
of
the
ingenious
notion
of
not
saying
anything
about
it
to
advise
defense
counsel
and
then
put
him
on
as
the
first
witness
in
chief
and
that's
what
they
did
to
testify
to
this
alleged
admission.
now,
mr.
hladis'
penology
of
event
is
somewhat
contradictory
because
according
to
corcoran's
own
testimony,
this
happened
after
the
shot.
according
to
cagney's
short
aft
--
was
--
was
had
after
8:30.
janega
says,
he
received
a
call
at
8:35.
so,
according
to
corcoran,
at
the
time
that
he
heard
this
petitioner
say
this,
janega
already
had
been
asked
to
come
to
the
station.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
janega
already
had
been
asked
to
come
to
the
station
at
the
time
that
--
that
corcoran
heard
this
alleged
admission.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
you
see.
now,
so
that
--
and
--
and
significantly,
officer
cagney
who
was
carrying
the
bulk
of
this
investigation
and
i
invite
your
honors'
attention
to
all
of
cagney's
testimony,
at
no
time
does
officer
cagney
say
that
he
heard
this
petition
to
make
an
oral
admission.
now,
i
had
several
other
points
that
i
want
to
cover
and
i
--
i
regret
the
--
the
inability
to
touch
upon
it
promptly,
but,
with
regard
to
dr.
proctor's
testimony,
dr.
proctor's
testimony
was,
and
he
is
an
expert,
an
expert
pharmacologist,
he
answered
the
--
the
hypothetical
question
to
the
effect
that
this
dose,
which
this
doctor
gave
this
man,
taken
into
account
his
condition
as
a
narcotic
addict,
his
pain,
his
suffering
that
that
amount
of
drug
would
have
produced
the
condition
which
this
petitioner
described
and
would
have
been
amnesiac
with
regard
to
his
remembrance
exactly
what
happened
and
would
have
had
the
effect
of
reducing
his
capacity
to
resist
interrogation.
now,
i
think
your
honor
--
your
honors
have
understood
the
point.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
have
one
bound
copy.
i
would
be
very
happy
to
make
that
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
--
i
will
do
so.
in
view
of
this
--
this
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
request
to
the
court
an
opportunity
to
file
a
supplemental
memorandum
which
will
include
the
pages
which
are
asked,
i
believe,
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
would
be
very
short
and
i
could
do
it
very
promptly
and
i
have
the
means
of
duplicating
its
sufficient
copies
to
distribute
to
the
court,
a
supplemental
memorandum
following
oral
argument
if
i
may.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
and
that
will
include,
as
mr.
hladis
kindly
reminded
me,
to
include
a
request
that
i
correct
also
a
page
in
the
petitioner's
brief
where,
unfortunately,
the
same
--
typographical
error
occurs
with
regard
to
gram
and
grain
on
page
21
and
i'll
do
that
by
way
of
the
memorandum.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
thank
you
and
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
did,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
thank
you.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
thank
you.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
reargument
of
the
case
in
which
certiorari
was
granted
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirming
dismissal
of
petitioner's
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
in
the
district
court
after
exhaustion
of
all
the
remedies
under
illinois
law.
to
set
this
case
in
proper
perspective,
i
would
first
take
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
the
substantive
federal
question.
then
i
will
briefly
state
the
procedural
history
of
this
case
including
the
federal
questions
presented
for
your
honor's
decision.
and
finally,
i
will
present
the
argument
which
i
believe
will
support
petitioner's
contention
that
his
conviction
in
the
illinois
criminal
court
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
in
stating
the
facts
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
only
refer
to
the
undisputed
facts
in
this
record
so
that
it
may
be
clear
that
i
will
not
rely
upon
any
fact
about
which
if
there's
any
dispute
between
the
parties.
on
january
1,
1954
at
about
1:45
a.m.,
charles
townsend
was
arrested
in
the
city
of
chicago
by
chicago
police
officers.
at
that
time,
townsend
was
19
years
of
age
and
since
he
was
15,
he
had
been
a
narcotic
addict
and
just
about
an
hour
and
a
half
prior
to
this
arrest,
he
had
taken
a
large
injection
of
heroin.
these
facts
were
all
known
by
the
police
officers.
he
was
taken
to
the
second
district
police
station
in
the
city
of
chicago,
questioned
a
short
time
about
the
murder
of
a
man
named
jack
boone
who
had
been
found
dead
on
december
18,
1953
in
the
city
of
chicago,
not
very
far
from
where
townsend
was
arrested.
about
five
o'clock
that
morning,
he
was
transferred
to
another
police
station
where
he
remained
without
being
interrogated
by
anyone
until
approximately
8:30,
the
evening
of
january
1,
1954.
he
was
then
brought
back
to
the
same
police
station
where
he
first
been
taken
and
interrogation
resumed
of
townsend
by
the
same
police
officers
who
in
the
meantime
had
gone
off
on
their
breaks.
soon
after
he
was
brought
back
to
the
second
district,
there
was
what
we
called
in
chicago
police
practice,
a
show
up
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
a
man
named
gus
anagnost
to
identify
townsend
as
the
man
who
had
attacked
him
with
a
brick
sometime
before.
gus
anagnost
did
not
identify
townsend
as
the
assailant.
in
fact,
he
picked
out
another
man
in
this
show.
soon
after
that
episode,
the
police
officers
attempted
to
continue
the
interrogation
of
townsend
and
they
discovered
that
townsend
was
then
in
the
throes
of
the
withdrawal
symptoms
of
the
drug
he
had
injected
the
early
morning
hours
of
that
day.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
approximately
14
hours,
your
honor.
now,
at
that
point,
the
assistant
state's
attorney
who
took
the
confession
here
involved
had
arrived
at
the
police
station.
he
saw
townsend
and
he
himself
suggested
that
a
doctor
be
called
and
as
he
said
to
his
superiors
to
determine
the
capabilities
of
townsend
to
withstand
interrogation.
a
doctor
employed
by
the
police
department
was
called
and
he
came
to
the
police
station
arriving
there
about
9:45
p.m.
he
immediately
diagnosed
townsend's
condition
as
a
narcotic
addict
in
the
withdrawal
symptoms
and
he
then
prepared
a
solution
consisting
of
phenobarbital,
a
sterile
content
of
the
tool
we
had
and
what
he
said
later
was
1/230-grain
of
hyoscine.
and
that
when
he
attempted
to
inject
this
into
townsend
there
was
some
quarrel
between
townsend
and
the
doctor
as
to
where
this
injection
was
to
be
made.
now,
it
is
very
clear
in
this
record,
if
your
honors
please,
that
none
of
this
was
of
townsend's
choosing.
the
closest
thing
the
record
shows
is
that
townsend
complained
of
being
ill,
the
rest
of
it
was
entirely
the
determination
of
the
police
around
them.
and
in
this
record,
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
at
the
time
that
this
doctor
was
called,
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
all
testified
that
townsend
had
said
that
he
did
not
want
to
talk
about
this
case
at
all.
the
police
officer
who
seemed
to
have
been
the
principal
officer
so
testified
mr.
janega
who
took
the
confession,
emphatically
explained
that
when
he
saw
townsend,
townsend
indicated
an
unwillingness
to
talk
about
the
case
at
all
because
of
his
inability
to
answer
any
question.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
had
not,
your
honor.
now,
there
is
in
this
record,
one
little
place
in
this
record,
mr.
justice
clark
in
which
one
police
officer,
not
the
principal
police
officer,
one
police
officer
inferred
from
an
answer
to
a
question
that
townsend
had
said
something
that
seems
to
have
been
incriminatory
sometime
prior
to
this.
but
no
way
it
is
attached
to
this
statement
in
view
of
the
petitioner.
but
he
had
not
made
any
statement,
he
had
not
confessed
to
be
at
the
crime.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
had
been
questioned,
mr.
justice
white.
he
had
been
questioned,
he
had
denied.
that's
very
clear
in
the
record,
your
honor,
very
clear.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
a
doctor
because
he
was
ill.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
now,
there
was
a
quarrel
mr.
justice
goldberg
between
townsend's
testimony
here
and
the
doc
--
and
the
police
officer
whether
the
idea
of
calling
the
doctor
was
entirely
the
police
off
--
there
is,
but
we
don't
rely
upon
that.
there
is
a
general
consent
that
he
asked
to
see
a
doctor,
the
doctor
was
called.
but
the
point
we
make
is
that
the
doctor
was
not
of
his
choosing,
it
was
a
police
doctor
employed
by
the
city
of
chicago
who
came
there.
the
medicine
was
not
of
his
choice.in
fact,
the
record
shows
very
clear
that
when
the
time
came
to
make
the
injection,
he
resisted
the
injection,
the
doctor
wanted
to
put
it
here,
he
asked
them
to
put
it
there,
but
nonetheless
the
doctor
said,
“i'll
do
it,
i
know
how
to
do
this,”
and
he
injected
the
drug.
now,
it
is
clear
in
this
record
that
a
miraculous
result
developed
as
a
result
of
this
injection.
this
man
who
had
told
that
mr.
janega
that
he
didn't
want
to
talk,
who
had
told
the
police
officer
that
he
couldn't
speak,
the
same
man
whom
the
police
officer
described
that
he
was
bent
so
many
times,
and
with
pain
that
he
couldn't
count
how
many
times
he
kept
on
bending
over
complaining,
the
same
man
no
soon
as
the
injection
was
completed,
the
doctor
walked
out
one
--
one
door,
in
the
same
room,
he
was
taken
into
the
adjoining
room
immediately
and
there
according
to
everyone
involved,
every
single
witness
of
the
prosecution,
a
completely
changed
individual
was
there
willing
to
answer
every
question
asked
to
them.
not
only
that
he
did
give
one
confession
on
the
record
now
before
your
honors
but
he
gave
five.
he
gave
one
that
he
robbed
gus
anagnost,
the
man
whom
had
said
that
townsend
did
not
rob
him.
he
gave
a
confession
that
he
had
murdered
a
man
named
thompson,
a
homicide
concerning
which
the
police
had
to
admit
they
had
no
evidence
and
even
townsend
according
to
mr.
janega
and
according
to
the
police
officers
had
no
independent
recollection
of
the
episode
leading
to
the
death
of
thompson.
he
also
confessed
to
the
murder
of
a
man
named
thomas
who
told
his
sister
that
when
she
came
to
the
hospital,
“i
had
just
had
an
accident,
it
was
just
one
of
those
things.”
and
concerning
whom
the
arresting
officer
or
the
investing
officer
complained
to
the
coroner
that
when
he
came
in
response
to
a
call
he
asked
them,
“why
did
you
bothered
to
call
me?”
there's
nothing
here
indicating
a
robbery
and
any
of
that
sort.
he
confessed
about
the
murder
of
thomas.
he
also
confessed
the
robbery
of
a
man
named
martin
and
then
finally
confessed
that
he
robbed
--
to
the
murder
of
a
man
named
boone.
he
also
confessed
the
robbery
and
murder
of
a
man
named
stinson
and
according
to
mr.
janega's
report
to
his
superiors,
this
was
such
a
billion
piece
of
police
work.
he
thought
these
police
officers
should
have
been
commended
because
he
pointed
out
to
him
the
cause
of
the
investigation
and
in
connection
with
this
interrogation
they
found
stinson's
shoes,
his
wristwatch
and
several
other
personal
items
all
in
and
about
townsend
or
connected
to
him.
the
jury
heard
all
of
that,
if
your
honors
please,
and
found
townsend
not
guilty
and
discharged
him.
now,
in
this
case
which
was
the
second
of
the
series
of
these
indictments
arising
out
of
these
confessions,
he
was
tried
and
sentenced
to
death.
a
review
was
had
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
which
i
represented
townsend
as
the
court-appointed
lawyer.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
affirmed
townsend's
conviction
and
the
use
of
this
confession
on
the
ground
that
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
medication
given
to
townsend
by
this
doctor
was
a
proper
medication
if
not
be
in
shown
otherwise.
and
that
since
it
was
and
the
thrust
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
opinion
is
that
since
it
was
not
an
improper
medication,
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
fact
that
he
also
had
regurgitated
a
confession
that
was
use
to
take
his
life
did
not
deny
due
process,
and
i'll
come
back
to
this
point
when
i
get
to
the
argument.
we
applied
for
certiorari
before
your
honors
and
with
mr.
justice
douglas'
believing
the
writ
should
have
been
issued,
then
this
court
denied
certiorari.
then
we
went
back
before
the
criminal
court
in
chicago
and
filed
under
illinois
law
a
post-conviction
petition
alleging
that
in
the
course
of
the
review,
counsel
on
appeal
had
learned
that
hyoscine
which
was
the
only
designation
but
for
one
other
place
in
the
record
used
in
describing
this
drug
to
the
court
in
jury
was
in
fact
a
drug
known
scopolamine
or
in
the
science
work
in
crime
detection
also
known
as
the
truth
serum
and
that
this
fact
crucial
as
it
was
and
informative
as
it
was
had
not
been
told
to
the
judge
or
jury
that
had
passed
upon
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
and
that
had
used
the
confession
to
impose
a
death
sentence
against
this
petitioner.
that
petition
was
dismissed.
we
took
another
review
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
the
court
in
a
memorandum
unreported
order
upheld
the
dismissal,
your
honors
denied
certiorari.
a
few
days
before
the
execution
of
townsend,
we
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes
sir.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
there
was
a
hearing
before
judge
butler
who
had
originally
granted
--
who
had
--
who
has
heard
the
case.
judge
butler
on
motion
of
the
state's
attorney
dismissed
the
petition.
there
was
a
hearing
in
the
sense
that
we
presented
the
petition
and
supported
by
affidavits.we
were
not
allowed
to
introduce
any
evidence.
but
on
motion
to
dismiss,
it
was
dismissed
on
the
theory
that
the
review
on
writ
of
error
under
several
illinois
cases
disposed
of
old
questions.
they
apply
a
very
broad
res
judicata
doctrine
in
post-conviction
procedures
in
illinois
and
the
supreme
court
upheld
the
dismissal.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
without
opinion,
just
a
memorandum
only,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
was
just
legal
argument
with
sufficiency.
the
affidavits
were
not
controverted.
there
was
no
counter-affidavit
filed.
now,
before
judge
igoe
in
the
united
states
district
court,
we
applied
for
certiorari
reviewing
all
these
facts
which
i
just
stated
to
your
honors.
in
addition
to
that,
by
this
time
i
had
learned
about
these
five
confessions
prior
to
the
time
of
the
affirmance
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
but
by
this
time
i
then
added
paragraph
18
to
which
i'll
make
further
reference
in
the
course
of
this
argument.
judge
igoe
dismissed
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
on
motion
of
the
respondents.
and
we
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
seventh
circuit
dismissed
the
appeal.
now,
we
asked
for
certiorari
in
this
court
and
your
honors
vacated
the
order
of
the
seventh
circuit
and
directed
that
the
matter
be
heard
pursuant
to
the
doctrine
of
jennings
versus
ragan.
of
course,
that
went
back
before
the
district
judge
and
this
time
respondents
obtained
the
three
volumes
of
the
trial
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
plus
the
one
volume
of
the
post-conviction
proceeding
and
that
judge
igoe
proceeded
then
to
the
request
of
the
petitioner,
a
brief
and
similarly
from
the
respondents.
briefs
were
filed
and
one
of
the
prayers
of
the
brief
and
one
of
the
contentions
made
in
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
before
judge
igoe
was
that
we
were
entitled
to
a
full
plenary
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
known
at
the
time
of
the
trial
that
this
drug
was
the
‘truth
serum,'
so
referred
scopolamine,
and
also
whether
or
not
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
which
we
then
argued
was
the
use
of
an
impermissible
stand
to
determine
due
process
whether
or
not
a
full
plenary
hearing
would
not
reveal
the
fact
that
this
petitioner
was
denied
due
process.
judge
igoe
entered
an
order
after
hearing
of
june
12,
1959,
an
order
that
was
dated
june
24,
again
dismissing
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
we
then
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
holding
that
in
a
habeas
corpus
application
a
federal
judge
is
limited
to
the
undisputed
portions
of
the
record
of
the
trial
court
and
holding
further
that
it
was
a
burden
upon
the
petitioner
to
prove
that
he'd
been
denied
due
process
and
the
court
said
that
this
burden,
the
petitioner
had
not
carry.
this
despite
the
fact,
the
record
is
clear
that
in
the
district
court
we
had
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
prove
the
allegations
of
the
petition
and
that
opportunity
had
been
denied
to
us.
and
on
the
substantive
question,
the
court
said
that
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process.
now,
this
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
if
your
honors
please,
presents
two
groups
of
questions,
one
procedural,
another
substantive.
the
procedural
question
presented
is
whether
it
is
as
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
in
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
of
corpus,
a
district
court
is
limited
to
the
undisputed
portions
of
the
record
of
the
trial
court
and
the
second
procedural
question
is
whether
error,
prior
judicial
error
was
not
committed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
on
the
ground
which
plainly
was
contradicted
by
the
record,
namely
to
hold
that
the
petitioner
had
not
carried
a
burden
when
the
course
was
dismissed
on
motion.
and
the
opportunity
to
carry
the
burden
had
been
denied
to
the
petitioner.
and
finally,
the
substantive
federal
question
is
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
violated
by
the
admission
in
evidence
of
a
confession
taken
from
a
defendant
while
under
the
influence
of
a
drug
injected
by
a
police
doctor.
now,
dealing
with
the
procedural
questions,
which
i
suggest
most
respectfully,
if
your
honors
please,
are
easy.
in
rogers
versus
richmond,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
an
order
in
a
habeas
corpus
matter
and
an
application
for
certiorari
is
made
before
your
honors.
and
your
honors
construed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
as
meaning
that
while
the
district
court
in
an
application
for
habeas
corpus
may
accept
the
determinations
in
the
state
court,
may
accept.
but
he
is
not
bounded
by
them.
he
may
in
his
discretion
and
judgment
having
examined
those
records
and
determined
whether
or
not
there
is
a
vital
flaw
to
use
the
words
from
brown
versus
allen,
he
may
accept
those
determinations
as
one
judge
may
always
accept
determinations
of
another
judge
fully
supported
by
evidence
and
consistent
with
law.
but
your
honor
said
that
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
as
not
making
a
binding
ruling
upon
the
federal
judge.
and
going
back
to
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
daniels
versus
allen,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
entrusted
to
the
federal
judges,
district
judges,
the
duty
to
determine
whether
in
a
state
court
proceeding
resulting
in
deprivation
of
liberty
or
life,
whether
the
federal
constitution
had
been
fairly
and
properly
determined
and
we
had
argued
in
the
district
court
that
the
thrust
of
the
application
for
habeas
corpus
was
that
in
the
state
courts,
the
federal
questions
which
the
petitioner
had
raised
had
not
been
fairly
determined.
and
thus
we
say,
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
judge
igoe
was
limited
to
the
undisputed
portions
of
the
record
that
--
that
judgment
is
in
conflict
with
the
second
circuit
opinion
in
rogers
versus
richmond
as
your
honors
construed
that
opinion.
because
it
isn't
true
and
your
honors
have
never
held
that
district
judges
are
limited
to
the
undisputed
portions
of
the
state
record.
but
the
facts
were
true
then,
habeas
corpus
wouldn't
mean
anything
to
a
federal
--
to
a
prisoner
from
a
state
court.
it
wouldn't
have
any
meaning
because
all
that
--
all
that
the
federal
judge
would
be
bound
to
do
was
to
look
and
see
whether
or
not
there's
been
some
undisputed
determinations
and
there'd
be
no
substance
for
habeas
corpus
application.
it
was
all
to
nullification
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
as
we
understand
it.
now,
with
regard
to
the
point
which
the
court
of
appeals
made
that
the
petitioner
did
not
carry
his
burden,
this
doesn't
require
much
more
than
a
comment.
i
took
the
time
out
today
just
to
be
certain
about
it
and
in
the
record
before
your
honors
is
the
brief
i
filed
for
this
petitioner
before
judge
igoe.
point
three
in
that
brief
argued
that
we
were
entitled
to
a
full
plenary
hearing
and
i
even
try
to
argue
before
judge
igoe
that
your
honors
caricature
of
that
judgment
on
application
for
certiorari
amounted
to
a
fine
determination
that
the
application
for
habeas
corpus
stated
the
cause
of
action.
and
that
the
court
was
without
power
to
do
anything
else
but
to
grant
a
hearing.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
your
honor,
first
i
wanted
an
opportunity
to
prove
by
competent
evidence
that
this
drug,
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
this
drug
was
not
a
proper
medication
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
you
see,
i
had
acquired
a
considerable
amount
of
practical
knowledge
about
hyoscines,
scopolamine,
and
its
use.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
in
the
state
proceeding,
your
honor,
the
--
see
that
the
point
is
new,
that's
the
first
thing.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
question
of
the
use
--
you
see,
i
don't
think
there's
ever
been
a
case
where
a
man
has
been
given
hyoscine
and
then
a
confession
taken
from
him
and
used
against
him.
either
in
practice
or
in
any
reported
case,
i
haven't
found
that
with
exception
of
griffith
versus
rhay
and
i
have
conceded,
everywhere
i've
argued,
that
mr.
john
branion
is
one
of
the
most
respected
defense
counsels
we
have
in
cook
county.
but
mr.
branion
just
didn't
understand
the
thrust
of
this
question,
it
was
complex.
and
the
matter
had
not
been
explored
properly.
i
take
the
position
that
the
objection
to
the
confession
includes
all
the
myriads
of
questions
which
are
conceivable
out
of
that
objection.
and
one
of
the
objections
was
when
that
--
when
that
confession
was
offered,
that
this
drug
given
to
the
petitioner
under
the
circumstances
here
involved
was
such
as
to
have
rendered
him
delirium
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
suppose
that
if
it
had
been
--
if
all
these
facts
had
been
known
that
the
supreme
court
perhaps
would
not
have
been
in
--
led
into
this
erroneous
--
erroneous
conclusion,
i
believe
it
could
have
been
done,
but
it's
just
a
matter
of
having
the
facts
and
since
the
objection
was
made,
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
defendant
waived
an
objection,
he
did
what
he
could
on
the
circumstances.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
none,
your
honor.
now,
the
point
is
made
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings
that
objections
were
made
before
judge
butler
to
these
other
coroner's
inquest
to
the
confessions.
now,
as
a
defense
counsel
with
some
experience,
i
can
understand
how,
in
a
murder
case,
evidence
of
other
charges
would
be
excluded.
and
i'm
told
by
a
supplemental
memorandum
here
that
we
have
taken
the
position
in
this
court,
we
didn't
take
in
the
court
below.
but
i've
looked
at
the
record
very
carefully
and
it
isn't
true
that
all
this
was
excluded
from
judge
butler.
the
record
shows
that
when
objections
were
made
to
these
other
hearings,
the
objections
were
finally
overruled
by
judge
butler,
and
he
knew,
judge
butler
knew
that
at
the
time
that
he
was
hearing
evidence
about
this
particular
confession,
he
knew
that
at
the
coroner's
hearing,
there
had
been
more
than
one
confession
taken,
and
that
appears
on
page
141
of
the
printed
abstract.
or
if
your
honors
need
a
most
certain
reference
to
page
392
of
capital
a
of
the
typewritten
record
and
judge
butler
overruled
the
objection
and
the
questions
that
judge
butler
himself
asked
showed
that
he
understood
that
more
than
one
confession
was
involved.
he
says,
question:
“did
you
say
it
was
about
five
minutes?”
he
answered,
“for
that
particular
statement?”
question:
“do
you
voted
to
asking
this
defendant
questions
about
the
medicine
involved?”
mr.
boone:
“that's
right.”
question:
“was
all
the
rest
of
the
time
that
was
spent
there
devoted
to
discussion
about
the
matters?”
“yes,
sir.”
the
court:
“do
you
want
to
object
to
that
question,
mr.
branion?”
mr.
branion:
“yes,
judge.
i
beg
to
it.”
the
court:
“objection
overruled.”
judge
butler
knew
very
well
that
these
interrogations
at
the
coroner's
hearing
involved
other
charges
so
that
after
preliminary
hearing
to
determine
the
admissibility
of
this
confession,
these
other
facts
were
either
directly
or
inferentially
brought
in
before
judge
butler.
so
it
isn't
correct
to
say
as
we
were
confronted
with
the
last
--
on
the
original
argument
that
the
defense
succeeded
in
keeping
out
from
judge
butler
all
the
information.
judge
butler
is
an
experienced
judge.
he
knew
that
a
coroner's
hearing
of
this
kind
and
there's
enough
in
this
record
that
have
alerted
any
experienced
judge
that
this
was
a
hearing
in
which
they
were
trying
to
do
what
the
police
officer
said.
they
were
trying
to
clean
up
the
record.
at
one
point
of
its
aspiration,
the
police
officer
complained
that
the
coroner
was
preventing
them
from
cleaning
up
the
record
with
this
social
drearily,
this
narcotic
addict
of
19
years
of
age.
and
judge
butler
knew
that,
so
that
it
is
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
your
honor
it
is
probably
the
safest
statement
to
make
about
this
drug.
if
you
were
to
make
a
complete
study
of
all
the
scientific
evidence
about
this
drug,
it's
an
undependable
drug.
it's
a
drug
which
has
been
limited
in
use
because
its
reaction
is
so
uncertain.
it
has
idiosyncrasies
which
the
best
pharmacologist
cannot
predict.
it
depends
upon
the
physical
makeup
of
the
individual,
even
the
chemical
content
of
his
blood
may
be
important
at
the
moment
that
it's
injected.
it
may
have
one
reaction
in
one
person
of
the
same
age,
the
same
weight,
and
the
same
physical
condition,
and
another
person
have
a
completely
idiosyncratic
result.
now,
no
one
knows
that
condition
of
charles
townsend
at
the
time
this
drug
was
injected.
but
the
significant
thing
is
this,
and
i
can't
get
away
from
this
point.
before,
the
doctor
was
called,
he
didn't
want
to
talk
to
anybody.
he
didn't
want
to
talk
about
the
case.
no
sooner
the
doctor
left
he
was
an
entirely
different
person.
not
only
did
he
give
the
confession
that
they
wanted,
but
he
also
gave
the
confession
in
this
--
in
the
four
of
the
cases
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
when
your
honors
requested
the
respondents
that
they
answer
more
specifically
paragraph
18
of
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
the
attorneys
for
the
respondent
attacks
as
exhibit
a,
the
letter
of
mr.
janega
which
he
wrote
to
his
superior
about
this
incident.
and
in
the
main
paragraph
of
this
letter
appear
these
words,
“after
his
administrations
referred
to
the
doctor,
i
was
able
to
get
confessions
from
townsend.”
those
are
the
words
of
the
assistant
state's
attorney
who
took
the
confessions,
“after
his
administrations,
i
was
able
to
get
the
confessions
indicating
that
the
injection
of
the
drug
was
the
prime
moving
factor
that
produced
these
confessions.”
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor,
because
this
would
be
different.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
you
see,
your
honor
we
have
a
number
of
cases
during
the
prohibition
days
and
even
after
of
confessions
taken
from
inebriated
defendant.
and
those
are
the
cases
by
the
way
which
the
supreme
court
had
been
relied
upon.
in
those
cases,
your
honor,
there
is
absent
state
power.
say
a
man
who
drinks
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
gets
drunk
and
goes
out
and
confess
that
he
murdered
john,
he
can't
complain
anybody
compelled
him
to
confess.
but
a
different
situation
exists
when
while
under
his
intoxication,
he's
given
a
drug
to
awaken
him
by,
i
think,
a
police
officer
or
a
state
police
doctor.
and
then
while
he
was
emerging
from
his
state
of
inebriation
and
this
destruction
of
the
will
occurs
by
the
drug
which
was
given
to
him,
a
different
situation
occurs,
your
honor.
i
distinguish
the
case
you
put
in
this
case
on
the
simple
ground
that
here
we
have
that
interposition
of
state
power
in
the
form
of
a
needle
and
a
drug
injected
by
a
police
doctor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
your
honor
i
was
assuming,
in
the
question
of
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
was
assuming
the
case
where
a
man
is
drunk
in
the
cell
and
while
he's
drunk
in
the
cell
he
begins
talking.
i'm
not
--
the
case,
your
honor,
refers
to
where
while
he's
drunk
the
police
officers
job
to
get
him
to
testify.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor.
no.
in
that
case
i
would
say
the
confession
isn't
voluntary
also
in
that
case.
now
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
would.
it
certainly
would
your
honor,
it
certainly
would.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
but
your
honor
it
seems
to
me
a
very
simple
rule
to
bear
in
mind
that
you
don't
question
a
person
who
doesn't
have
control
of
his
willpower.
and
a
narcotic
addict
in
the
throes
of
the
withdrawal
symptom
is
not
a
person
who
acts
with
willpower.
your
honors
have
held
that
any
factor
which
destroys
the
will,
whether
be
physical
or
mental,
your
honors
have
held
that
in
leyra
versus
denno,
blackburn
versus
alabama
and
all
the
cases
your
honors
have
decided.
the
important
thing
is
--
the
important
question
is,
was
this
confession
a
result
of
a
voluntary
act.
was
it
volitional?
now,
if
narcotic
addict
takes
his
own
drug
and
while
he's
lying
there
and
joined
stupor,
that
he's
self-imposed,
and
he
regurgitates
a
confession
and
all
the
police
does
listen
to
him,
do
nothing
neither
urging
him,
that
question
is
more
difficult
but
we
don't
have
that
questions
before
us.
you
see,
now
that
question
is
a
difficult
question.
but
that's
not
the
question
now
here
your
honor
and
i
go
back
to
the
point
which
i
think
is
the
thrust
of
this
case.
before
the
doctor
came,
he
said,
“i
cannot
talk
to
anybody.”
and
there
--
this
is
undisputed.
the
police
--
the
police
officer
testified
to
his
condition
and
then
when
the
drug
is
given
to
him
immediately,
immediately
the
police
officer
testified
that
while
dr.
mansfield
was
leaving
one
room,
he
was
leaving
townsend
into
the
table
where
mr.
janega
was.
and
mr.
janega
said
this
was
a
different
man
entirely.
the
man
whom
he
said
that
he
wanted
to
have
his
capability
determined
by
the
doctor
was
now
just
simply
answering
questions
and
the
--
and
the
chronology
of
events
showed.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
not
as
to
the
admissibility
of
the
confession,
your
honor
because
in
illinois,
we
don't
submit
that.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
credibility
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
now,
i'm
not
known
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
your
honor,
the
record
doesn't
show
except
in
the
general
discussion
of
this
drug
that
the
question
doesn't
--
the
record
doesn't
show
that
judge
--
that
judge
butler
had
all
of
these,
which
is
my
point.
and
one
of
the
tragedies
of
this
case
is
this
--
that
all
these
facts
are
not
known,
that's
why
we
have
post
convictions
proceedings.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no.
well,
in
the
sense
that
someone
representing
this
man
knows
about
it.
this
defendant
certainly
didn't
know
anything
about
it.
he
didn't
know.
you
see
according
to
the
prosecutions
own
witnesses,
this
man
was
just
one
grade
of
a
(inaudible).
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
had
counsel,
yes.
he
had
counsel,
court-appointed
counsel,
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
make
no
point
here
about
in
the
competency
of
counsel
as
such
except
this,
that
inherent
in
the
facts
of
this
case
mr.
justice
harlan,
that's
not
the
question.
and
that
is
whether
inherently
in
the
facts
here,
there
isn't
a
question
of
denial
of
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation,
you
see.
and
i
submit
that
the
objection
to
the
--
to
the
confession
made
at
the
time
he
was
(voice
overlap)
includes
this
question
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
griffith
versus
rhay
where
in
that
case
while
the
man
was
on
the
--
out
of
an
operating
table
and
while
he
still
on
the
influence
of
several
drugs
something
like
scopolamine,
hyoscine,
he
gave
a
confession.
the
court
didn't
pass
upon
the
involuntariness
of
the
confession
itself.
the
court
went
to
the
much
more
esoteric
question,
and
that
is
that
he
was
denied
right
of
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation
when
he
was
taken
with
police
officers
and
court
reporters
and
thus
the
confession
is
admissible.
now,
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
inherent
in
the
objections
of
the
confession,
is
included
this
other,
which
is
a
due
process
of
questions
which
your
honors
have
held
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
didn't
have
the
facts.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
record
doesn't
show
that
your
honor,
except
that
this
fact
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
you
see
there
was
enough
quarrel
about
it.
there's
enough
quarrel
about
it
between
counsels
to
indicate
that
that
everyone
knew
that
this
--
that
as
i
--
i
do
not
want
to
sound
(inaudible),
your
honor,
but
on
january
4,
1954,
it
was
charlie
townsend
day
at
the
coroner's
hearing
because
they
had
all
the
cases
there
that
involved
townsend
anywhere.
and
the
point
is
made
here
by
counsel
for
the
respondents
that
at
this
coroner's
hearing,
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process
because
his
sister
was
present.
now,
your
honors
can
imagine
how
it
affected
one
sister
of
his
at
a
place
where
the
prosecution
represented
by
a
lawyer
of
some
20
years
experience
and
half-a-dozen
police
officers,
and
the
only
one
present
there
in
the
audience
is
his
sister.
they
make
that
point.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
your
honor,
that
question
brings
out
a
very
instinct
fact
about
this
case.
he
did
testify
about
this
case
here,
the
boone
case.
there's
a
dispute
between
the
parties
whether
that
testimony
was
voluntary
or
not.
in
fact,
the
record
shows
a
great
deal
of
concern
about
that
and
that's
how
these
coroner's
hearings
came
into
prominence
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
the
defendant
testified
that
what
he
said
at
the
coroner's
hearing
was
in
fact
told
him
by
the
police
officers.
that
was
his
testimony
on
the
record.
it
was
this
testimony
of
the
defendant
on
direct
examination
that
gave
rise
to
the
attempt
of
the
prosecution
to
prove
that
what
he
said
before
the
coroner's
hearing
was
not
a
suggestion
by
the
police
officer
but
was
voluntary.
there's
a
great
deal
of
dispute
whether
or
not
at
the
coroner's
hearing
when
the
coroner
did
what
they
do
in
chicago,
asked
the
defendant,
“do
you
want
to
testify?”
he
said,
“no.”
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
parties
where
that
occurred.
finally,
with
this
police
officer
questioning
him,
he
finally
said
yes.
then
he
answered
the
questions
almost
in
the
same
way
that
the
statement
is
worded.
the
result
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
this
one
in
particular.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
this
one
particularly.
there's
an
interesting
episode
there
when
--
in
connection
with
one
of
the
homicides,
he
--
he
asked
the
question,
“where
were
you
on
the
night
of
december
3,
on
that
date?”
and
he
said,
“i
was
at
--
at
6:30
p.m.”
or
whatever
the
hour
was,
he
said,
“i
was
at
giles
&
35th.”
and
as
your
honor
well
knows,
giles
&
35th
is
quite
a
distance
from
47th
&
wabash.
so
the
coroner
pointed
out
that
was
quite
a
distance.
and
there,
it
developed
that
episode.
can
i
make
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
of
adjournment
yesterday,
i
was
answering
a
question
of
mr.
justice
goldberg
with
regard
to
the
events
on
the
occasion
of
the
coroner's
hearing
of
january
4.
i
was
at
the
point
of
saying
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
with
regard
to
the
inquest
into
the
death
of
thompson
when
the
deputy
coroner
asked
the
petitioner
about
this
particular
incident.
he
asked
him
where
he
was
in
the
night
in
question.
townsend
answered
that
he
was
in
the
vicinity
of
35th
in
giles
in
the
city
of
chicago.
now,
it
happened
that
the
coroner
knew
that
the
body
of
the
decedent
was
found
at
47th
in
wabash
and
the
coroner
turned
to
the
police
officer
and
said,
“you
must
have
the
wrong
man.”
at
that
point,
the
investigating
officer
turned
to
townsend
and
all
these
facts
are
in
the
coroner's
minutes
now
before
the
court
as
part
of
their
response
to
paragraph
18
of
the
petitioner's
habeas
corpus.
the
officer
then
turned
to
townsend,
began
jogging
his
memory
as
to
some
conversation
the
officer
had
with
townsend
prior
to
the
inquest
and
i
remind
your
honors
that
the
origin
of
this
dispute
in
the
record
arose
because
townsend
had
said
that
what
he
had
said
in
the
coroner's
hearing
was
what
the
officer
had
told
him
to
say.
when
the
interrogation
continued,
the
deputy
coroner
turned
to
the
officer
and
said,
“look,
you
must
have
the
wrong
man”.
at
that
point,
the
officer
said
to
the
coroner,
“well,
we
can
go
out
and
get
these
guys.
they
have
their
patterns.
why
shouldn't
we
get
credit
for
these
cleanups?”
in
other
words,
he
was
saying
to
the
coroner
that
this
being
the
first
time
we're
here
this
year,
we're
cleaning
up
some
unsolved
murders
of
1953
and
this
petition
appears
to
be
as
good
as
an
individual
clean
up
the
record
with
as
anyone
else.
that's
all
part
of
the
record
now
when
your
honors
request
the
respondents
to
specifically
answer
paragraph
18
for
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
was
not,
your
honor.
it
was
not
the
practice
in
cook
county
to
require
counsel
at
coroner's
hearings
although
it
is
the
practice
for
defendants
to
be
confronted
with
what
they
say
or
not
say
at
the
coroner's
hearing.
now
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor,
at
the
subsequent
criminal
trial.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
or
he
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
the
cross-examination.
if
he
doesn't
testify,
it
is
not
admissible
if
he
doesn't
testify.
but
if
he
does
testify
as
did
the
petitioner
here
when
he
tried
to
show
what
happened.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
is
just
the
nature,
your
honor,
to
determine
how
the
decedent
came
upon
his
death.
it's
the
ancient
and
classical
coroner's
inquest
inquiring
to
the
cause
of
death.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
is.
it's
a
very
important
part
of
the
criminal
proceedings
in
illinois.
now,
a
great
deal
has
been
made,
if
your
honor's
please,
to
the
insistence
of
the
petitioner
in
this
court
to
make
reference
of
these
confessions
and
we
are
told
by
respondents
of
this
court
that
we
have
taken
an
inconsistent
position
in
asking
your
honors
to
consider
these
confessions
while
we
sought
to
object
to
them
in
the
trial
court.
and
since
the
objection
has
been
made
so
extraneously,
i
have
taken
your
case
to
go
back
and
look
to
the
record
which
i
asked
your
honors
to
examine.
on
page
55
of
the
common
law
record
of
capital
a
which
is
the
proceedings
in
the
criminal
court
appears
a
motion
made
on
february
9,
1955
by
this
petitioner,
asking
the
court
to
direct
the
state
attorney
of
cook
county
to
furnish
him
with
all
the
copies
of
the
confessions
taken
from
him
on
january
1,
1954.
that
motion
was
denied
at
the
outset
of
the
trial.
it
happens
to
be
the
law
in
illinois
today
that
a
defendant
who
confesses
to
a
crime
upon
his
being
arrested
is
entitled
upon
arraignment
to
a
copy
of
his
confession.
in
1955,
the
law
was
just
a
reverse.
it
was
the
practice
in
cook
county
not
to
let
a
defendant
see
a
copy
of
his
own
confession
until
he
came
to
trial
and
it
was
the
result
of
the
activities
of
the
defense
bar
in
cook
county
that
in
1955,
section
729
of
chapter
38
was
amended
to
provide
the
law
as
it
now
exist.
but
in
1955
when
this
petitioner
came
to
trial,
the
law
was
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
these
copies
of
his
confession
and
when
he
made
the
request
by
motion
of
his
counsel,
he
was
denied
the
copies
of
the
confession
so
that
if
this
motion
had
been
granted,
we
don't
know
what
defense
counsel
would
have
made
of
these
confessions.
these
confessions
were
denied
the
petitioner
by
the
trial
court
so
it
isn't
true
that
the
defendant
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
sir?
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
available
in
the
sense
that
that
police
had
them
in
their
possession.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
they
were
not,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
you
see,
your
honor
on
january
1,
the
petitioner
had
been
interrogated
at
the
police
station
after
this
drug
injection.
they
had
five
confessions
he
had
given,
a
five
felonies,
three
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
five
separate
confessions
taken
each
individually
each
time
and
the
respondents
have
told
your
honors
that
they
are
all
separate
confessions
taken
of
separate
different
crimes
and
given
all
at
one
time
while
he
sat
there
soon
after
drug
injection.
within
a
few
minutes
--
i
think
five
minutes
or
ten
minutes.
prior
to
that,
he
said
he
wouldn't
talk
to
anybody.
now
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes
–-
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
and
the
instant
thing,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
clark,
that
with
regard
to
the
death
of
thomas
johnson,
they
have
the
confession.
they
have
the
confession
already
but
by
the
time
of
the
inquest,
he
couldn't
repeat.
you
see,
the
drug
had
worn
off.
he
couldn't
repeat
what
he
had
said
so
they
were
trying
to
jog
his
memory
with
the
dispute
generating
between
the
police
officer
and
the
coroner
which
is
shown
in
the
coroner's
minutes.
so
that
the
police,
in
answer
your
honor's
question,
the
police
did
have
these
confessions
then
but
it
is
not
the
practice
as
i'm
committing
with
it
of
the
police
producing
the
confession.
they
hold
those
confessions
you
see,
until
the
time
of
trial
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh,
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
the
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no.
not
town
--
townsend
didn't
have
any
counsel.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
the
inquest,
counsel
had
--
there
was
no
attorney
there
for
townsend.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor.
they
didn't
introduce
the
inquest
of
the
other
homicides
at
the
trial.
they
didn't
do
that.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
and
he
did.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh
he
did.
you
see
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
they
did
use
them
to
impeach
him.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
they
were
available
insofar
as
the
minutes
were
relevant
to
his
cross-examination.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
is
true.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
represented
him
in
the
post-conviction.
i
didn't
represent
him
in
the
original
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
had
access
to
them
--
i
had
access
to
the
coroner's
minutes
and
the
post-conviction
petition
was
based
upon
the
very
point
that
i
make
here.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
i
did
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
and
they
ruled
against
me.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
and
the
supreme
court
affirmed.
they
rejected
the
contention
i
made
here.
now,
to
come
back
briefly
to
a
point
which
i
think
is
very
important,
if
your
honors
please.
this
case
is
no
different
today
before
your
honors
than
it
was
the
day
that
i
appeared
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
when
i
argued
it.
the
only
difference
is
that
in
the
interim
of
time,
i
learned
a
great
deal
more
about
scopolamine
than
did
mr.
branion
know
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
thrust
of
the
constitutional
question
raised
by
this
petitioner
when
he
objected
to
the
admission
against
him
of
the
confession
taken
from
him
while
he
was
under
the
influence
of
a
drug
given
to
him
by
a
police
doctor
is
the
same
question
presented
here.
your
honors
could
decide
this
question
overlooking
all
these
other
questions
about
the
niceties
of
scopolamine,
its
colloquial
use
as
a
drug
known
as
“truth
serum”.
because
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
brief
that
i
filed
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
it
is
the
very
question
presented
here.
the
only
difference
between
the
case
now
and
then
is
simply
that
i
have
added
more
detail.
i
know
now
more
about
this
drug.
i'm
convinced
from
my
knowledge
of
the
subject
that
the
constitutional
issue
was
well-posed
at
the
time
it
was
made
and
that
the
confession
at
the
time
it
was
offered
was
an
involuntary
confession,
the
product
of
narco-interrogation.
now,
the
point
is
made
by
the
respondents
that
this
was
not
the
same
kind
of
connivance
between
a
doctor
and
the
police
as
in
leyra
versus
denno.
but
i
say
to
your
honors
that
they
were
not
interested
in
the
good
health
of
charles
townsend.
the
reason
why
they
call
that
doctor
was
to
see
to
it
that
charles
townsend
was
put
in
a
condition
by
which
he
could
be
interrogated.
and
as
mr.
jernigan
said
to
his
superiors
after
the
administration,
i
was
able
to
get
the
confessions.
it
is
because
of
that
ability
to
get
the
confession
after
the
administration
of
the
drug
that
we
say
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
violated
by
the
use
of
this
confession.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
whether
a
drug
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
whether
a
confession
taken
from
a
state
prisoner
while
he
is
under
the
influence
of
a
drug
injected
into
him
by
state
police
officer
is
a
voluntary
confession
when
it
appears
from
the
facts
that
prior
to
the
injection
he
would
not
talk
and
immediately
after
the
confession
after
the
injection,
he
did
give
the
confession.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
if
that
injection
produces
a
destruction
of
his
will.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
is
true.
but
as
your
honors
have
held
that
if
the
ruling
against
the
petitioner
is
not
supported
by
evidence
which
your
honors
will
respect
and
i
submit
to
you
in
this
case,
the
evidence
shows
that
he
was
--
his
will
was
affected
by
that
injection
and
as
pointed
out
by
the
very
facts
i've
related
here.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
if
the
aspirin
tablets
--
we
could
then
demonstrate
by
the
fact
that
the
aspirin
tablets
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
and
you
remind
me
of
a
point
i've
made
in
this
case.
you
know
this
case
stands
for
a
very
dangerous
doctrine.
if
an
ordinary
motorist
is
going
down
the
street
according
to
the
townsend
doctrine
and
he
has
an
ordinary
automobile
accident
and
he
is
taken
to
the
police
station
and
complains
of
a
headache
and
he
asked
for
a
doctor
and
the
doctor
comes
in
and
gives
him
what
the
doctor
thinks
is
proper
and
as
a
result
of
that,
he
is
put
in
a
stupor
and
he
begins
talking
about
crimes
he
has
never
committed.
according
to
the
townsend
case,
he
can't
object
because
the
test
applied
by
the
supreme
court
is
not
volition.
its
adequacy
of
the
medication,
the
fact
that
it
takes
his
life
upon
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
is
of
no
moment.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well
then
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
there
has
been
a
finding.
i
can
see
that
because
otherwise
it
wouldn't
have
been
affirmed.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no.
but
all
i'm
saying
your
honor,
the
finding
is
controverted
by
the
indisputable
record
and
the
indisputable
evidence
we
now
have
before
us.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
question
is
clear
in
this
record.
in
fact
the
doctor
said,
he
gave
him
the
drug
because
he
knew
that
it
was
to
pacify
and
he
used
a
very
instant
expression
to
put
him
in
more
of
a
state
of
--
or
on
reality
and
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
affecting
his
mind
and
for
the
purpose
of
pacify
and
to
deprive
him.
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
drug
and
the
drug
produced
the
confession.
now,
we
don't
--
we
don't
have
the
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
your
honor,
i'm
glad
you
asked
me
that
question,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
like
to
see
this
court
determine
this
case
finally
.this
case
has
been
in
the
judicial
proceedings
since
1955.
and
i
think
the
time
has
come
for
us
to
have
a
determination
of
this
issue.
your
honors
can
determine
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
this
confession
was
unconstitutionally
admitted
and
thus
directed
back
to
the
trial
court
and
the
district
court
for
the
entry
of
proper
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
which
i
can
then
present
to
that
court
and
we
can
dispose
of
this
case.
i
think
that
this
record
--
that's
why
when
i
began
my
argument,
i
said
to
your
honors,
i
was
going
to
predicate
this
argument
only
on
undisputed
facts.
these
facts
i
stated
to
you
are
not
subject
to
dispute.
so
therefore,
no
further
hearing
is
necessary.
they
ruled
on
the
matter
as
a
legal
question
below.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor,
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
sir?
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
we
had
a
hearing
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i'd
adduced.
i
could
adduce,
i
could
produce
and
call
more
competent
scientific
people
than
dr.
mansfield
ever
was
and
they
would
all
testify
that
this
drug
caused
this
confession
and
since
your
honor
asked
me,
i
will
tell
you
this
your
honor
that
i've
been
in
communication
with
some
rather
expert
people
in
this
country
on
this
subject.
and
if
i
have
the
opportunity
to
have
this
case
heard
on
the
merits,
i
would
produce
some
outstanding
experts,
all
of
whom
would
testify
that
this
drug
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
this
petitioner
in
the
circumstance
he
was
in
as
a
narcotic
addict
with
a
huge
injection
of
heroin,
he
was
put
in
a
position
where
he
had
no
control
over
his
will.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
is
true.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
as
a
question
of
fact
but
i
say
your
honor
that
we're
not
precluded
if
the
record
shows
that
the
determination
of
that
question
was
not
properly
done
by
the
--
in
other
words,
if
the
constitutional
question
is
not
properly
determined
by
the
trial
court,
that
doesn't
preclude
our
coming
to
the
federal
court
on
habeas
corpus.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
to
the
extent
that
there
were
objections
sustained
here
and
there.
i
suppose
that
--
from
the
record,
mr.
branion
put
it
all
he
had.
i
supp
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
of
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
but
your
honor,
i
think
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
that.
if
the
trial
court
was
wrong
in
the
first
place
and
the
affirmance
was
erroneous
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
was
wrong
because
they
concluded
that
the
confession
was
admissible
when
the
evidence
before
the
judge
showed
it
was
not.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
may
be
true
but
where
the
constitutional
question
remains,
we
still
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
the
constitutional
issue.
we're
entitled
to
that
and
this
petition
is
entitled
to
that
because
the
constitutional
question
was
unfairly
resolved.
it
was
not
properly
determined.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
sir?
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
judge.
in
our
practice
your
honor,
they
don't
make
findings
of
fact.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
your
honor,
let
me
make
myself
clear.
if
your
honor
should
determine
that
there
should
be
a
rehearing
of
these
factual
matters,
we'll
proceed
accordingly.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
believe
that
on
this
record,
as
it
now
stands,
that
is
not
the
only
answer.
i
believe
your
honors
could
take
this
record
as
it
now
stand
since
it
presents
a
legal
question
and
determine
that
that
confession
as
it's
shown
by
the
record
contrary
to
what
judge
igoe
concluded
because
judge
igoe
could
have
made
this
conclusion
himself.
your
honors
could
make
that
conclusion
here.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor
and
your
honors
have
said
that
on
number
of
occasions.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
sir?
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
in
the
first
place
your
honor,
if
that
was
the
only
thing
that
this
petitioner
had
to
contend
with
in
the
trial
court,
he
would
have
been
acquitted.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
because
no
one
would
have
believed
that
police
officer
because
every
police
officer
in
the
case
contradicted
this
officer.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
you
see,
your
honor,
if
we
didn't
have
to
contend
with
the
written
confession,
i
wouldn't
worry
at
all
about
what
this
officer
said
because
officer
cagney
contradicts
this
other
officer.
and
if
you
wish
my
answer
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor.
it
was
not
cagney,
it
was
officer
corcoran
and
cagney
was
the
principal
officer.
you
see,
i
have
a
cynical
view
of
that
officer's
testimony.
i
believe
that
somebody
whispered
to
him
that
it
was
necessary
before
the
jury
to
say
this.
he
didn't
say
it
in
the
preliminary
hearing
and
he
is
contradicted
by
every
officer
in
the
case.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
no,
no.
i
said,
i
predicated
my
remark,
your
honor
by
saying
that
i
have
a
cynical
view
of
his
testimony.
you
see,
if
the
only
evidence
i
had
to
contend
with
or
this
petitioner
have
to
contend
within
the
trial
court
was
officer
corcoran's
testimony
that
he
heard
an
oral
remark.
you
see,
in
illinois,
we
have
well
established
cases
that
oral
remarks
are
not
seriously
considered.
you
see,
and
this
--
it's
true
that
officer
corcoran
said
that
and
it
caused
a
great
deal
of
dispute
in
the
record.
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
approximately,
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
varies
to
individuals
depending
upon
the
tolerance
developed
over
the
years
of
addiction
but
i'm
told
that
it
may
start
within
six
hours
to
12
to
14
hours
after
the
injection.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
an
hour
and
a
half
or
two
until
the
drug
has
completely
worn
off
or
unless
if
the
addict
is
kept
in
custody,
he
receives
no
medication,
eventually,
he
will
suffer
a
great
deal
but
eventually
he
will
leave
that
state,
that
mental
of
illness,
mental
and
physical
illness.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
does.
you
see,
these
officers
knew
and
by
the
way,
this
transfer
of
this
man
from
one
police
station
was
interesting.
it
doesn't
--
to
the
unsuspecting,
it
has
no
significance
but
to
the
experience,
it
does.you
see,
they're
putting
him
away
he
wouldn't
be
questioned
to
be
left
alone
until
eight
o'clock
is
significant
when
you
look
at
it
retrospectively.
these
officers
knew
who
he
was.
they
all
admit;
the
record
is
clear.
the
officers
knew
he
was
an
addict.
they
knew
he
had
taken
the
drug.
in
fact,
officer
cagney
so
testify,
so
they
knew
--
they
knew
all
these.
now,
it
is
true
that
we
don't
have
this
case
here
we
had
in
leyra
versus
denno
where
there
is
proof
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
stayed
another
room
and
they
bugged
the
room
and
this
--
we
don't
have
the
tape
recordings
and
all
that.
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
thing.
we
have
here
much
more
subtle
form
of
the
use
of
knowledgeable
consequences
of
a
drug
addict
in
this
condition
and
as
i
said
before,
they
weren't
interested
in
charlie
townsend's
mental
and
physical
well-being.
they
wanted
to
put
him
in
a
condition
to
question
him.
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
this.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
if
i
made
the
answer
to
that
direct
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
carry
that
impression
completely.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
there
isn't
the
obvious
scheme
that
we
find
in
leyra
versus
denno.
this
is
much
more
subtle
to
say.
and
you
see
your
honor,
if
this
wasn't
part
of
the
plan,
the
thing
they
would
have
done
and
these
officers
were
officers
of
great
experience,
they
would
have
let
that
man
alone.
that's
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
leave
him
alone
over
a
period
of
time
and
then
they
could
have
questioned
him
later
and
he
would
have
resisted
their
interrogation.
you
see,
this
is
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
was
--
that
is
the
ostensible
--
that's
what
the
record
shows
ostensibly.
all
i'm
saying
your
honor
that
when
you
reflect
upon
it
a
little
longer
than
that,
the
ostensible
purposes
are
displaced
by
the
real
purpose
of
the
injection
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
i
just
quoted
to
your
honors
today
a
letter
which
is
made
part
of
the
record
written
by
the
officer
who
took
the
confession
in
which
he
said
that
after
the
administrations,
i
was
able
to
get
the
confession.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
you
see,
your
honor,
in
illinois
we
don't
--
in
the
criminal
courts,
we
don't
have
findings
of
fact.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
we
don't
do
it
like
that.
there
should
be.
i've
often
thought
we
ought
to
have
especially
in
confession
cases.
the
judge
says,
confession
motion
overruled
and
naturally,
that
concludes
all
the
findings
inherent
in
that
determination.
but
we
don't
have
finding
the
fact
as
we
have
it
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
standard
that
was
erroneous
was
that
this
drug
was
a
proper
drug
to
be
used
under
the
circumstances.
this
is
what
they
used
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
it
is
a
question
of
fact
but
it
was
also
a
question
of
fact
your
honor
in
rogers
versus
richmond
which
your
honors
held
that
reliability
of
a
confession
is
an
unconstitutional
standard
to
be
applied
in
a
confession
case.
your
honors
so
held
in
the
richmond
case
and
i
suggest
to
you
your
honor
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
illinois
trial
courts
made
the
same
error
in
this
case
that
the
connecticut
courts
made
in
rogers,
you
see.
they
applied
the
test
here
which
i
find
in
reflection
almost
ludicrous
because
they
say
that
the
fact
that
the
drug
produces
confession
that
takes
a
man's
life
is
of
no
consequence.
the
fact
that
it
is
important
is
that
the
drug
eased
his
pain
for
the
moment.
you
see,
that's
what
the
supreme
court
did
and
that's
what
the
trial
court
did
in
effect
by
its
own
ruling
of
the
objection
to
the
confession.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
no,
no.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
nothing
like
that.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
that
was
rogers
versus
richmond.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
no,
he
didn't
say
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
error
is
the
same
kind
of
error
using
a
different
standard.
they
used
the
standard
in
this
case
of
the
propriety
of
the
drug
not
its
effect
upon
his
will,
you
see.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
--
analytically,
the
same
error
was
made
in
this
case
as
was
made
in
rogers
versus
richmond
and
we
cite
rogers
versus
richmond
and
depend
upon
it
as
part
of
our
argument
before
your
honors.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
will
appreciate
that.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
if
your
honor
should
hold
here
that
this
confession
on
this
record
as
it
now
is
before
your
honor
as
it
was
before
the
district
court
and
that
the
district
court
erred
in
dismissing
the
petition
and
your
honor
should
find
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
conclusion
that
that
confession
was
inadmissible.
then
upon
remand,
only
one
thing
will
be
left
for
the
district
judge
to
do
and
that
is
to
make
certain
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
which
shall
guide
the
state
authorities
in
the
retrial
of
this
petitioner.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh!
no,
your
honor,
by
no
means.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
by
no
means.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
and
they
--
i
assume
your
honor,
they
have
no
positive
charges
against
this
petitioner.
i
happen
to
know,
they
have
no
evidence
against
him.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
(voice
overlap)
accept
his
confession.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
mr.
chief
justice,
to
answer
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
more
precisely,
mr.
hladis
was
not
representing
the
respondent
before
judge
igoe.
if
you
look
in
the
report
of
proceedings
of
june
12,
1959
on
page
61
of
the
report
of
proceeding,
i
asked
judge
igoe
for
a
full
plenary
hearing
with
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence,
point
three
of
the
petitioner's
brief
before
judge
igoe
prayed
for
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
judge
igoe
denied
that
opportunity
by
his
memorandum
order
of
june
24,
1959.
now,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
have
you
accept
my
answer
since
mr.
hladis
wasn't
there.
i
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
to
introduce
evidence
to
be
heard
in
the
full
sense
of
that
term.
judge
igoe
denied
that
opportunity.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
61
one,
yes.
yes,
page
61
and
if
you
look
--
if
your
honor
will
please
look
at
my
brief
before
judge
igoe,
point
three,
i
asked
him
for
a
hearing
and
urged
it
because
i
wanted
an
opportunity.
in
fact,
i
even
went
out
with
some
rather
language
that
at
least
when
the
man
is
executed,
when
he
is
taken
to
his
grave,
we
can
all
be
satisfied,
he
had
a
final
consideration
of
his
question.
and
judge
igoe
denied
that
opportunity.
now,
that
closed
it.
judge
igoe
ruled
on
the
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss
in
effect
and
held
that
he
was
satisfied.
in
other
words,
he
took
the
court
records.
and
to
answer
mr.
justice
clark's
question
with
regard
to
the
confessions,
i
did
represent
this
petitioner
in
the
post-conviction
petition.
i
did
refer
to
those
confessions.
now,
my
difficulty,
if
your
honor
please,
is
the
use
of
the
word
“canvass”.
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
all
that
was
done
was
the
petition
was
filed.
i
made
reference
of
these
confessions,
asking
for
the
same
opportunity
before
judge
butler.
i
thought
if
judge
butler
had
given
me
the
opportunity
to
be
heard,
he
might
have
been
persuaded
with
the
fact
which
mr.
hladis
has
not
answered
your
honor's
question.
he
didn't'
tell
you
about
gus
anagnost,
saying
that
x
had
assaulted
him
with
a
brick
and
then
a
moment
later,
they
have
taken
a
confession
from
townsend
after
this
drug
injection
that
he
had
robbed
gus
anagnost.
you
see,
i
was
hoping
that
if
i
could
ever
get
a
judge,
a
trial
judge,
to
listen
to
me,
to
hear
this
evidence,
he
might
be
persuaded
all
these
confessions
were
like
stinson
was.
and
with
regard
to
the
stinson
prosecution,
mr.
hladis
didn't
touch
upon
the
point
that
these
items
of
property
of
the
deceased
found
in
and
about
townsend's
room
was
shown
to
the
jury
to
have
been
in
the
possession
of
other
persons.
that's
why
the
jury
found
him
not
guilty.
that's
why
they
acquitted
him.
they
didn't
acquit
him
on
his
specious
malfunctioning
of
the
jury
system.
they
took
all
of
it
and
they
found
him
not
guilty
because
he
didn't
believe
the
confession
and
i
was
hoping
if
i
can
get
before
a
judge
would
hear
the
evidence,
he
might
conclude
with
me
that
this
confession
of
boone
case
was
as
furious
as
the
one
in
the
stinson
case,
a
furious
as
the
one
that
gus
anagnost
case,
as
furious
as
the
one
in
the
thompson
case,
as
furious
as
the
one
in
the
johnson
case.
that's
what
i
want
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
before
judge
butler
in
the
boone
case?
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor.
these
were
separate
--
integrally
separate,
yes.
now,
one
other
point
about
judge
hoffman
and
i
wish
to
emphasize
this
point
that
when
judge
hoffman
was
asked
this
question
about
the
identity
of
scopolamine
and
hyoscine
before
the
jury.
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
had
been
determined
by
judge
butler
and
i
have
said
this
time
and
again
that
the
only
place
in
this
record
where
anyone
thought
to
ask
anyone
who
knew
about
the
identity
of
scopolamine
with
hyoscine
was
on
rebut
--
on
surrebuttal
as
mr.
hladis
said,
on
some
surrebuttal
when
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
have
been
determined.
when
the
only
question
was
the
credibility
to
be
given
the
confessions
under
the
illinois
law
and
that
matter
was
resolved
to
the
jury.
now
your
honors,
i
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh
no.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no.
your
honor,
my
use
of
that
word
is
at
the
fact
that
the
coroner's
hearing
indicate
that
in
case
of
johnson
--
thomas
johnson
--
you
see,
if
that
confession
ever
was
offered
in
evidence
and
the
evidence
of
the
circumstances
of
johnson's
death
were
put
against
it.
my
idea
of
it
is
that
it
just
wouldn't
hold
one
when
the
man
tells
a
doctor
and
his
sister
and
everybody
else
that
he
had
an
accident,
of
course
the
state
will
say,
he
was
hit
in
the
head.
we
don't
know
how
he
was
hit.
no
one
saw
he
was
hit.
he
might
have
been
hit
by
a
truck.
we
don't
know.
people
are
hit
in
the
head
with
trucks
and
other
forms
of
accident.
this
man
said
he
had
an
accident.
that
was
my
point
and
with
regard
to
gus
anagnost
when
the
victim
himself
says
that
that's
not
the
man
and
that
they
have
a
confession
that
he
was
the
person.
you
see,
that's
what
i
meant.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no
your
honor,
they
were
not.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
yes,
they
were
not.
thank
you,
your
honor.
