justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
a
hearing
on
this
case
below,
any
kind
of
a
hearing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
old
was
he
at
this
time?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
means
that
between
the
hour
of
his
arrest
that
one
or
something
in
the
morning?
justice
john
m.
harlan
until
the
following
morning,
he
was
not
interrogated
by
any
police?
justice
john
m.
harlan
until
the
following
evening?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
interrogation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
this
dose
an
unusual
dosage?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yeah.
justice
john
m.
harlan
from
your
point
of
view,
his
testimony
was
more
favorable
for
the
â€“
for
the
juries
than
it
was
before
the
judge?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
was
he
--
was
he
cross
--
was
your
man
represented
by
counsel?
justice
john
m.
harlan
any
point
made
of
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
thought
there
was
a
clear
cut
issue
presented
to
the
jury
that
the
state
on
the
one
side,
that
this
was
not
only
normal
dosage,
but
less
than
normal
dosage
and
on
your
side
that
it
was
excessive
dosage.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
both
those
--
that
issue
of
fact
was
--
it
was
presented
to
the
jury
and
that
the
jury
brought
in
the
verdict
that
it
did?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
--
will
you
deny
any
instructions
that
were
requested
with
this
issue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
what
you're
saying
as
i
understand
it
correctly
that
the
issue
that
you're
arguing
now
when
it
went
up
the
case
--
as
the
case
was
tried,
and
as
it
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
didn't
figure
very
heavily?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
mechanical
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
we've
got
the
whole
trial
record
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
a
separate
record
on
the
motion
to
suppress?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
it
be
possible
for
you
to
leave
with
the
clerk
the
page
numbers
of
the
record
both
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
on
the
trial
itself
that
bear
upon
the
issues
we've
got
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
whole
record
is
here.
i'm
just
asking
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
mechanical
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
made
you
the
record
that
you
referred
--
where
you
made
this
proper
improvement
is
denied?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
i
mean
in
the
hearing,
not
the
allegation
to
the
complaint
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
at
the
post-conviction
hearing.
i
understood
you
to
say
to
justice
brennan
that
you
would
made
an
offer
proof
which
was
denied.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
did
you
order
a
proof,
did
you
make
a
tender
proof
that
you
said
you
would
like
to
introduce?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
you
may
either
through
a
formal
tender
of
proof,
a
proffer
proof
or
by
colloquy
with
the
judge
where
he
would
focus
his
mind
that
you
some
evidence
that
had
not
been
offered
at
the
original
hearing
which
you
now
wanted
to
offer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
page
you're
referring
to
mr.
leighton
or
the
document
that
you're
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
refer
to
the
part
of
your
brief
that
you
mentioned
to
justice
black
were
you
raise
this
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
trying
to
quarrel
with
you.
all
i'm
getting
at
is
this.
obviously,
new
counsel
as
you
are
coming
in,
capital
case
as
it
turned
--
defined
that
everything
that
he
contend
of
what
should
be
said.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
hand,
the
point
as
you
are
making
now
that
you
are
precluded
from
offering
evidence
which
you
stated
that
this
vital
evidence
is
also
important.
as
i
understand
you
do
have
pointed
that
at
any
point
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
where
you
were
present
that
you
said
here,
i've
got
witness
x
to
witness
v
or
whatever
evidence
you
have
that
i
want
to
put
on
now
to
show
what
i
contend,
you
did
not
do
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
never
made
the
proffer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
when
those
documents
were
coroner's
documents,
inquest
documents
were
offered
by
the
state
at
the
trial,
they
were
objected
to
by
the
petitioner?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
defendant
took
the
stand
at
the
trial,
did
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
distinguished
from
the
suppression?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
he
was
subject
to
unrestricted
cross-examination?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
that
admission
before
he'd
been
--
any
drugs
have
been
administered?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that
at
the
record,
do
you
know
or
never
mind
if
you
don't.
i'll
find
it,
never
mind.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
just
as
much
state
power
in
the
case
of
the
police
officers
who
persist
in
taking
a
confession
from
a
man
he
knows
to
be
intoxicated
at
certain
state
action
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
that's
what
you're
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
weren't
all
those
issues
before
the
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
before
the
jury,
it
isn't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
is
it
before
the
judge,
was
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
they
make
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
your
point
that
there
has
been
more
knowledge,
more
scientific
knowledge
brought
to
light
about
the
effects
of
this
drug
since
the
hearings
were
involved
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
he
has
had
a
counsel,
didn't
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
--
how
would
you
put
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case
that
are
asked
which
concerned.
how
would
you
put
constitutional
issue
of
this
case
that
is,
how
do
you
determine
whether
the
precise
question
was
answered?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law
--
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
injection
of
any
drug
precedes
a
confession,
an
initiated
confession?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
a
question
of
fact.
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
trial
of
fact
below.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
ruled
against
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
had
a
hearing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
had
a
hearing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
evidence
--
if
you
went
back
for
a
further
hearing,
what
evidence
would
you
adduce
that
is
not
argued
before
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
there
was
conflicting
evidence
at
that
time
when
the
hearing
was
already
held.the
issue
is
resolved,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
a
question
of
fact.
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
you
forbidden?
were
you
provided
or
it
was
your
predecessor
presented
in
putting
in
any
evidence
that
he
can
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
really
asking
for
is
that
a
new
trial
of
the
issue
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
which
you
with
a
great
skill
would
be
representing
this
defendant
in
setting
a
new
trial.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
he
was
wrong
and
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
statute
claimed
to
be
wrong.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
that's
what
every
question
of
the
fact,
every
determination
of
the
fact
involves
any
conflicting
evidence.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
agree
with
the
findings
of
fact.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
agree
with
the
finding
of
facts.
that's
what
you
mean,
i
think.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
remember
you're
saying
and
you
correct
if
i'm
wrong
from
the
first
argument
of
this
case
and
i
think
i
asked
you
the
question
that
you
did
not
claim
that
the
administration
of
this
drug
by
the
prison
doctor
was
part
of
a
scheme
to
induce
this
man
to
confess
which
we
may
know
such
claim
is
done.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
making
these
findings
of
fact,
i
call
them
findings
of
fact.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
making
the
determination
that
this
was
not
an
involuntary
confession,
do
you
claim
that
the
trial
court
applied
any
erroneous
constitutional
standards?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
question
of
fact.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
ruling
made
or
statement
made
by
the
trial
court
that
--
in
determining
whether
this
was
a
voluntary
confession
or
not.
he
was
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
confession
was
true
and
was
cooperative?
justice
john
m.
harlan
nothing
of
that
kind.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
rogers
against
richmond.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
isn't
rogers
versus
richmond.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
addressed
yourself
to
this
case
in
a
factual
situation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suggest
we
are
to
do
something
without
the
army?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
referred
to
the
first
petition
for
certiorari
in
which
you
said
that
the
petitioner
described
the
drug
as
alternatively
hyoscine
and
scopolamine.
is
that
the
same
alternative
description
appeared
in
the
record,
the
trial
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
you
give
me
the
citations
to
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
transcript.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
titled
transcript.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
dr.
hoffman
a
state
witness?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
you've
just
read,
was
that
the
result
of
that
question
on
direct
cross-examination?
well,
never
mind,
i'll
get
the
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
cross-examination.
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
you
sit
down.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
more
question
about
these
confessions.
at
the
second
hearing
before
judge
igoe,
was
there
any
proper
proof
made
by
the
petitioner
respecting
the
circumstances
of
these
confessions
or
as
to
their
truth
or
falsity,
the
collateral
confessions
that
was
rejected
by
judge
igoe.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
record
before
judge
igoe.
justice
john
m.
harlan
after
the
remand,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
what
disposition
did
judge
igoe
made
to
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
current
thing
that
i'm
peculiarly
interested
in
myself
is
whether
or
not
the
igoe
hearing
following
the
remand
from
this
court,
the
petitioner
sought
to
introduce
any
evidence
with
respect
to
this
collateral
confessions
as
i
call
them
and
whether
if
he
did,
whether
he
was
denied
that
opportunity.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
the
only
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
