mr.
edward
j.
hladis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
before
i
begin
my
argument
i
would
like
permission
of
the
court
to
correct
and
with
my
apologies,
a
clerical
error
on
page
37
of
our
brief.
it
is
the
fifth
last
line
of
the
second
paragraph,
the
sentence
beginning,
“beginning
about
11:15
and
it
reads
am,
it
should
read
pm.”
i've
discussed
this
with
mr.
leighton
and
he
agrees
that
such
is
the
fact.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
fifth
last
line
of
the
second
full
paragraph
on
page
37
and
the
line
should
read
beginning
about
11:15
pm.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
pm.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
gentlemen
as
the
respondents
view
this
controversy
as
is
been
presented
by
the
petitioner's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
as
well
as
his
brief,
it
is
our
view
that
it
is
--
it
is
resolved
into
two
issues,
the
immediate
issue
whether
judge
igoe,
the
united
states
district
court
judge
in
chicago,
abused
his
discretion,
when
in
accordance
of
the
mandate
of
brown
versus
allen,
he
determined
that
the
issue
was
raised
by
the
petition
where
the
habeas
corpus
had
been
fully
and
fairly
raised
in
the
state
court
proceedings,
having
explored
there,
and
that
the
petitioner
was
accorded
fair
treatment
and
due
process
and
accordingly
it
was
unnecessary
to
continue
any
further
with
the
cause.
that
lead
us
to
the
more
fundamental
issue,
and
that
is
whether
on
the
basis
of
that
state
record
there,
which
we
frankly
admit
is
the
only
thing
that
we
can
advance
in
the
state
of
illinois
in
support
of
our
claim
that
this
petitioner
in
this
particular
controversy
was
treated
fairly
by
the
authorities.
i
think
that
the
last
question
which
was
propounded
by
justice
frankfurter,
a
question
which
relates
to
the
use
of
the
coroner's
minutes
at
this
time
when
during
the
trial
of
the
proceeding
in
the
trial
court,
when
they
were
sought
to
be
used
by
the
state
for
purposes
of
an
impeachment,
able
defense
counsel
objected
vigorously.
i
think
that
question
focuses
the
attention
of
everybody
upon
a
difficulty
which
is
present
in
the
proceeding
here.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh
yes,
twice.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh!
he
took
it
on
the
suppression
and
also
before
the
jury,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
the
explosion
came
at
the
time
on
the
–
on
the
motion
to
suppress
during
the
preliminary
hearing
which
is
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
as
the
case
has
been
posed
here,
and
with
all
due
respect
for
a
very
good
friend
and
opposing
counsel,
the
only
breach
which
the
petitioner
advances
here
in
this
court
between
the
federal
judicial
system
and
the
illinois
system
is
the
judgment
of
conviction.
as
we
read
his
petition,
as
we
read
his
brief,
he
would
just
as
soon
present
this
case
on
a
sort
of
a
priori
basis
with
little
or
no
regard
for
the
record
as
it
was
made
down
below.
coming
to
what
we
consider
is
the
first
and
the
immediate
issue,
the
question
as
to
whether
judge
igoe
acted
properly
when
he
proceeded
no
further
with
any
hearing,
but
relied
after
an
extensive
investigation
analysis
of
the
state
court
record
upon
the
findings
of
the
state
court.
we
call
the
court's
attention
of
course
to
the
landmark
case
of
brown
versus
allen
which
is
explored
thoroughly.
the
function
of
a
trial
district
judge
and
which
has
laid
down
the
limitations
and
a
formula
so
to
speak
of
procedure.
we
also
call
attention
to
a
case
which
came
out
of
our
own
state,
jennings
v.
ragan,
which
correct
and
justifiably
so,
which
corrected
a
procedure
which
had
grown
up
there
of
the
trial
courts
relying
strictly
upon
the
opinion
rather
than
upon
the
record.
so
that
now,
the
district
judge
is
bound
before
he
makes
any
determination,
without
further
hearing
of
a
federal
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
is
bound
to
make
his
own
independent
analysis
and
investigation
of
the
state
court
record.
and
if
he
should
find
upon
that
investigation
that
there
is
no
vital
flaw,
that
all
issues
raised
in
the
federal
petition
for
habeas
corpus
were
fully
raised,
were
fully
explored
and
fairly
explored
by
the
trial
--
by
the
illinois
or
state
court
trial
system
as
well
as
the
courts
of
review
then
he
is
entitled
as
a
matter
of
law
to
dismiss
the
federal
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
without
further
hearing.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well
yes
it
does
except
this
and
i
will
lead
back
into
the
last
question
which
you
asked
mr.
leighton.
if
the
allegations
of
the
federal
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
should
advance
matters
which
were
either
present
in
the
trial
court
record
and
were
not
exploited
or
which
could
have
been
made
available
thereby
changing
--
a
change
in
trial
technique
or
trial
strategy,
then
i
respectfully
submit
that
in
view
the
very
sensitive
relationship
between
our
federal
and
state
governments
and
particularly
in
the
field
of
criminal
law
and
the
administration
thereof,
that
a
man
should
not
be
allowed
to
change
or
to
adopt
a
new
trial
strategy
on
the
federal
level,
because
after
all,
as
i
see
it
your
honor,
the
federal
statute
empowers
a
federal
court
to
review
a
state
court
judgment
from
the
standpoint
as
to
whether
or
not
he
has
been
denied
due
process
of
law.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
correct.
coming
back
now
to
a
conclusion
of
our
first
point
and
that
is
under
question
as
to
whether
judge
igoe
acted
properly,
we
submit
respectfully
that
he
did
and
that
a
fair
analysis
of
the
state
court
record
will
show
that
the
petitioner
herein,
charles
townsend
was
accorded
due
process
of
law.
that
comes
to
--
come
--
bring
us
the
fundamental
question
in
this
entire
controversy
and
the
question
as
it
revolves
about
the
admission
of
state's
exhibit
2
which
is
the
written
confession
in
question.
at
the
very
offset
during
the
course
of
mr.
leighton's
argument,
a
series
of
questions
were
directed
toward
him
on
the
possibility
of
mr.
leighton's
claim
that
there
was
some
collusion
between
the
state's
attorney,
the
court
reporter,
the
police
officers
and
the
doctors
to
bring
about
a
condition
in
this
particular
petitioner
which
will
unable
him
to
confess
to
a
series
of
crimes.
i
think
it's
only
fair
to
the
court
particularly
since
the
question
was
asked
several
times,
although
i
am
familiar
with
the
practice,
as
a
policy
i
can
explain
why
the
state's
attorney
as
well
as
the
court
reporter
were
present,
that
is
now
the
matter
of
record.
now,
if
i
may
go
in
to
that,
i'll
be
glad
to
explain
that.
in
cook
county,
illinois,
the
state's
attorney
is
staffed
by
120
assistants
and
about
110
of
those
assistants
are
assigned
to
what
is
known
as
night
duty.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
there
are
120
assistants
roughly
and
about
110
are
assigned
to
what
is
known
as
night
duty
and
for
almost
four
years
i
was
assigned
likewise
and
i
know
what
it
is.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
pardon.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
a
good
question
sometime
and
the
county
and
primary
the
city
is
divided
into
two.
and
for
as
you
gentleman
may
know
or
may
not
know,
the
dividing
line
in
chicago
is
madison
street
for
north
and
south,
and
state
street
for
east
and
west,
so
they
take
madison
street
and
cut
it
right
down
the
line.
and
it
so
happens
that
the
police
districts
which
are
about
40,
42
in
number,
just
about
divide
about
equally
and
the
crime
rate
just
about
divide
equally.
well,
as
a
matter
of
policy
which
has
existed
in
the
chicago
--
in
the
cook
county
state's
attorney's
office
for
years
regardless
of
which
type
of
administration
was
in
office,
in
cases
of
all
homicide
and
aggravated
assaults,
police
are
not,
police
are
not
to
take
confessions,
written
confessions.
now,
how
does
that
come
about?
a
man
is
arrested
and
he
is
interrogated
by
the
police.
as
soon
as
an
admission
is
made,
it
is
then
the
police
officer's
function
to
call
the
states
attorney's
office
in
the
west
side
of
criminal
division
where
there's
a
man
in
attendance
all
the
time
and
he
says,
“we
have
john
doe
here.
he
has
confessed
to
the
homicide
happening
and
so
and
so.”
the
next
step
is
for
the
sergeant
at
the
desk
at
the
office
to
call
whichever
of
two
men
are
on
duty
and
that
call
can
come
in
at
anytime
and
he
says,
“call
the
29th
district,
call
the
36th
district
and
talk
to
lieutenant”
so
and
so
they
have
so
and
so.
and
the
assistant
is
under
certain
responsibilities
too
because
he
immediately
calls
and
of
course
his
first
question
is,
whether
the
man
is
able
to
talk,
is
he
sober,
has
he
given
a
statement?
in
other
words,
care
has
always
been
taken
so
that
the
state's
attorney
would
not
become
involved
in
any
manner
or
whatsoever
in
police
investigation.
in
other
words,
the
man
is
ready
to
give
a
statement.
when
the
assistant
ascertains
that
that
happens
then
it
is
his
duty
to
call
his
office
back
and
get
one
of
the
court
reporters,
now
they
have
four,
they
are
employed
regularly,
so
that
means
court
reporters
are
out
every
fourth
night.
now,
that
is
the
reason
that
mr.
janega
and
mr.
matsuoka,
the
court
reporter
worked
at
the
29th
district
because
as
officer
corcoran
testified
before
the
gentleman
became
ill
in
this
case,
he
had
made
an
oral
admission
to
the
boone
murder
and
it
so
happened
then
that
the
state's
attorney
was
notified
and
mr.
--
it
was
mr.
janega's
turn
and
he
went
out.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes
sir,
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
corcoran
is
the
man
that
testified
to
it
sir
and
i
might
add
that
cautionary
instructions
were
given
on
that
confession.
i
might
add
also
as
perhaps
this
court
knows
already
that
no
attack,
no
attack
had
been
made
in
the
illinois
court
of
review
on
the
giving
of
any
instructions
even
though
they
had
all
been
spread
in
the
abstract
of
the
record.
and
the
first
construction
of
the
two
which
relates
to
the
oral
admission
says
definitely
that
an
oral
admission
has
been
made
in
this
case
and
admitted
and
then
the
caution
is
given
as
to
how
it
is
to
be
considered.
never
any
objection
made
to
that
confession
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
corcoran.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
corcoran,
officer
corcoran.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
the
record
shows
that
mr.
janega
was
called
about
8:35.
that
admission
must
have
come
sometime
between
8:00
and
8:30
because
as
i
remember
the
record,
mr.
janega
arrived
about
9:05
which
is
just
about
correct,
because
i
have
to
know
the
gentleman
lives
and
how
far
yet
to
travel
and
at
the
time
that
he
arrived,
the
doctor
had
not
yet
arrived,
because
mr.
janega
saw
the
petitioner
suffering
from
the
throes
of
the
withdraw
symptom
and
primary
(inaudible)
area.
so
that
would
be
roughly
45
minutes
before
the
doctor
arrived.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
record
is
not
too
clear
on
that
sir.
they
were
talking
to
him.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
correct.
they
were
talking
to
him.
the
night
shift
came
back
on
and
then
they
brought
--
had
him
brought
over
from
the
other
station
back
to
the
second
district.
they
began
talking
to
him
about
8:00
in
the
evening,
and
then
all
of
the
sudden,
the
withdrawal
shut
in
and
he
got
this
intense
stomach
cramps
and
pains
which
--
which
are
consistent
with
that
problem
and
he
told
them
that
he
couldn't
--
couldn't
say
any
further
and
he
asked
for
help.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
have
that
worked
out
to
in
my
brief.
i'm
looking
for
that
annotation.
i'm
also
looking
for
the
annotation
officer
corcoran's
testimony.
that
is
correct,
he
returned
about
8:30
record
v90-100,
that's
i'm
reading
from
page
35
on
my
brief
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh
yes,
they
were
assigned
to
that
case.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
after
8:30,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
pardon.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
he
was
called
about
8:35
according
to
his
memorandum
to
his
superior.
it's
dated
january
4,
1955,
8:35
pm
on
january
1,
1954.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
and
he
would
need
at
least
a
half
hour
to
travel
a
distance
from
his
home
to
the
29th
district
place.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct,
except
that
the
--
the
attorney
and
the
assistant
judges
from
himself
whether
the
man
is
in
a
position
to
talk
or
what
he
says
is
worth
taking.
if
it's
still
in
the
area
of
police
investigation,
the
assistant
has
the
discretion
refuse
to
come
out
of
that
time.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
we
have
a
five-minute
period
during
which
time
mr.
townsend
must
have
made
the
oral
admission
and
it
must
have
been
categorical
enough
because
mr.
janega
informed
his
superiors
that
he
left
or
he
received
the
call
at
8:35
and
left.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
he
had
committed
the
boone
murder.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
the
--
i
believe
that
substantial
what
the
record
means
to.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
c
--
there's
volume
c
your
honors
649-652,
mr.
--
officer
corcoran
testified.
now,
coming
back
to
the
chronology
of
events
here,
we
have
the
arrest
of
this
gentleman
during
the
early
hours
of
january
1,
1954
and
it
is
undisputed
in
the
record
at
sometime
around
midnight
or
shortly
thereafter,
he
had
taken
a
shot
of
narcotics
in
order
to
satisfy
his
habit.
the
state's
testimony
is
that
during
those
early
hours
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
but
before
he's
arrested.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
before
he
is
arrested.
yes,
it
was
some
two
to
two
and
a
half
hours
before
he
was
arrested.
from
the
record,
i
always
say
it
perhaps
around
stroke
at
midnight
when
that
happened.
according
to
the
state's
testimony,
he
was
talked
to
or
spoken
with
for
about
half
hour,
statistical
information
was
secured.
there
were
general
questions
about
crimes
in
the
area.
his
testimony
is,
otherwise,
he
claims
that
there
was
interrogation
there
for
period
about
an
hour
and
a
half
to
two
hours.
it
is
undisputed
that
as
of
5:00
in
the
morning,
he
was
taken
from
the
second
district
to
a
district
few
miles
away.
i
might
add
at
this
point
that
that
happens
quite
often
in
city
of
chicago
because
some
police
districts
have
better
facilities
than
the
others.
you'll
note
it
from
this
record
that
while
he
was
held
at
the
second
district,
he
was
held
in
the
woman's
cell.
it
was
vacant
of
course
at
that
time,
but
the
areas
--
in
some
of
the
police
district,
the
areas
were
quite
limited
and
they
don't
have
much
working
space.
nobody
talked
to
him
except
by
his
own
testimony,
he
was
asked
one
question
by
the
keeper
at
the
second
police
station
that
was
if
he
wanted
food
and
he
refused
it.
and
then
in
the
evening
of
january
1,
1954
when
a
squad
of
a
four
men
namely
cagney,
fitzgerald,
corcoran,
and
martin
--
martin
returned
to
work
and
would
have
been
assigned
to
the
series
of
cases.
he
was
returned
to
the
second
district
and
thereabout
8:30,
the
interrogation
began.
as
i
stated
before,
office
corcoran
testified
the
fact
he
made
his
oral
admission
and
mr.
janega
was
called.
he
arrived
about
9:05.
before
mr.
janega
arrived,
this
gentleman,
mr.
townsend,
already
began
--
began
to
suffer
his
withdrawal
problems
and
he
made
a
request
for
help
and
then
help
was
secured
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
dr.
mansfield
is
a
police
surgeon.
he
attached
to
headquarters
1121
south
state
street.
a
suggestion
is
made
here
that
--
that
mr.
cagney
selected
the
police
surgeon.
well,
mr.
cagney
had
no
other
choice.
he
has
no
authority.
he
has
no
budget
available
to
call
any
doctor.
he
must
rely
upon
the
medical
help
that
is
offered
by
the
police
department.
and
according
to
mr.
--
dr.
mansfield's
own
testimony,
he'd
been
active
since
1940
and
apparently
been
doing
quite
a
bit
of
work.
dr.
mansfield
came
and
a
gentleman
had
been
told,
he
diagnosed
the
case
as
withdrawal
symptoms
which
arise
under
the
fact
that
narcotics
have
left,
in
the
case
of
an
addict,
have
left
the
system,
the
human
body
and
the
person
needs
to
more
narcotics
and
he
goes
into
these
intense
pains.
he
gave
him
a
treatment,
1/230
of
hyoscine
and
a
1/8
grain
of
phenobarbital.
now,
a
suggestion
or
more
than
a
suggestion
has
been
made
here
by
opposing
counsel
that
dr.
mansfield
contradicted
himself,
but
he
spoke
of
grains
on
emotion
the
preliminary
hearing
then
he
spoke
of
grams
when
they
were
before
the
jury.
that's
the
first
time
i've
ever
heard
that
distinction
made
during
the
eight
years
of
this
case
has
been
in
court
proceedings.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
mr.
justice
black,
i
tried
to
catch
up
on
some
pharmacology
on
this
but
i
haven't
caught
up
with
that
much
as
i
--
i
can
give
you
an
answer
that
rapidly
as
to
what
the
effects
would
be.
but
i
dare
say
that
it
might
be
radical,
dare
say
that
it
would
be
radical
at
16
times
because
by
--
according
to
the
petitioner's
own
medical
authorities,
the
therapeutic
dose
is
six
tenths
of
a
milligram
up
to
a
little
bit
over
one.
now,
that's
a
therapeutic
dose,
and
not
a
toxic
dose
and
i
would
say
that
16
times
1/230th
would
exceed
by
far
the
therapeutic
dose.
and
of
course,
hyoscine
perhaps
is
just
like
any
other
drug
if
it's
given
in
excess
just
like
commercial
aspirin
can
bring
on
the
toxic
effect.
now,
coming
back
to
counsel's
observation
of
the
claimed
discrepancy
between
dr.
mansfield's
testimony
in
their
preliminary
hearing
as
against
the
jury
the
jury
--
their
hearing
before
the
jury,
i
have
examined
rather
thoroughly
and
as
carefully
as
i
can
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
that's
a
typographical
error
and
the
reason
that
i
say
it
is,
if
you
examine
dr.
proctor's
testimony
on
rebuttal
before
the
jury
and
the
questions
as
they
were
propounded
by
counsel
for
the
defendant
in
that
trial
never
once
that
he
speak
of
grams,
he
spoke
of
grains
all
the
time.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
that
is
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
far
as
i
can
determine,
no
reference
has
been
made
to
those
issue
at
all
and
i
might
say
--
i
might
--
and
i
think
it's
consistent
with
counsel's
argument
here
today,
that
counsel
is
very
adroitly
avoided
any
issue
of
dosage.
and
they
sort
move
down
an
area
of
attempting
to
convince
this
court
that
the
administration
of
the
drug,
regardless
of
the
amount,
regardless
of
the
dosage
per
se
vitiates
the
confession.
well,
of
course
that
raises
problems
too.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
right.
aspirin
is
a
drug
too.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
pardon.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
he
makes
no
issue
of
dosage
at
all.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right,
and
i
think
that's
a
fair
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well
of
course
that
raises
the
question
before
this
court.
i
mean
of
we
pursue
the
petitioners
argument
to
its
conclusion.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
it
could
be.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
whether
it
should
be
or
not
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
it
could
be
raised,
but
i
think
the
approach
and
the
argument
would
be
the
same
that
it's
been
made
to
this
court
if
i
remember
correctly,
since
the
first
petition
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed.
if
you
go
back
to
the
october
term
in
1957
when
the
first
petition
was
filed,
you
will
find
that
the
argument,
the
materials
advanced,
the
medical
authorities
are
practically
identical
with
those
which
are
quoted
in
today's
brief.
and
if
you
examine
the
record
and
particularly
doctor
proctor's
testimony,
the
toxicologist,
you'll
find
that
he'd
made
reference
to
the
identical
authorities
which
are
being
advanced
in
today's
controversy.
so
that
the
benefit
of
that
knowledge
at
least,
the
benefit
of
that
knowledge
was
presented
in
all
that
it's
asked,
makes
to
the
trial
court,
not
only
when
the
question
of
competency
came
up
before
judge
walker
butler
outside
the
presence
--
presence
of
the
jury
but
when
the
question
of
credibility
came
up
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
i'd
like
to
make
just
one
more
remark
about
the
question
of
dosage
and
the
argument
as
we
see
it
has
been
leveled
primarily
at
the
use
of
the
hyoscine
scopolamine.
judging
from
the
counsel
or
the
petitioner's
own
medical
authorities
which
he
advances
in
his
brief.
as
i
said
before,
the
normal
adult
therapeutic
dose
was
somewhere
five-tenths
to
sixth
tenths
of
a
milligram
up
to
an
over
one.
here,
we
have
less,
less
than
2900
of
a
milligram
which
is
almost
half
or
i
say
half
of
the
normal
dose.
now,
the
--
there
have
been
several
questions
raised
as
the
possibility
of
what
would
happen
if
this
case
got
back
or
if
it
should
go
back
whether
there
could
be
a
hearing.
since
the
conviction
was
affirmed
on
writ
of
error
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
petition
writ
of
certiorari
was
denied
here
with
one
justice
dissenting,
there's
been
only
one
claim
that
has
kept
this
petitioner
alive
and
has
kept
his
litigation
continuing
and
that
is
the
claim
that
the
trial
court
was
not
appraised
of
the
fact
that
hyoscine
was
the
same
as
scopolamine
and
that
in
fact
was
used
by
foreign
authorities
for
truth
serum
purposes.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
alluded
to
the
order
on
the
writ
of
error
after
the
post-conviction
proceeding
wherein
that
order
refers
specifically
to
the
point
in
the
state
court
record
and
dr.
hoffman
was
testifying
at
that
time
wherein
he
said
that
scopolamine
and
hyoscine
are
the
same.
however,
you
examine
the
cross-examination
of
dr.
mansfield
from
the
very
beginning,
you
will
know
that
mr.
branion
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
and
mr.
branion
was
defense
counsel,
a
man
who
is
today,
even
today
in
the
pleadings
in
this
court
characterized
as
able
defense
attorney.
he
knew
when
he
was
talking
about
and
he
examined
dr.
mansfield
thoroughly
on
questions
of
truth
serum.
that
question
was
presented
to
the
illinois
courts
and
very
thoroughly.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
think
it
can
be
use
for
that
purpose,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
dramatic
qualities
have
a
reason
out
of
--
from
scopolamine,
from
the
extensive
use
of
the
drug
by
the
nazi's
during
--
during
the
world
war
ii
purposes.
they
used
it
in
very
excessive
dosage
for
truth
serum
purposes
and
very
famous
movie
has
been
making
around
with
that
quite
evident.
of
course
our
position
is
that
we
are
far
below,
far
below
the
lethal
dose,
the
normal
therapeutic
dose
in
all
condition
(inaudible).
i'd
like
to
make
two
more
observations
your
honors
and
--
and
i
will
close.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
it
is
a
recogni
--
it
is
a
recognized
treatment
for
withdrawal.
it's
used
for
other
areas
and
i'm
going
to
get
into
that
very
shortly.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
--
i
examine
mr.
leighton's
authorities
--
medical
authorities
and
journals
very
carefully
and
while
all
the
authorities
do
not
mention
that
is
used
there,
even
though
as
they
do,
do
not
tell
you
how
much
you
need
for
a
truth
serum
purpose,
in
other
words
to
knock
a
person
into
a
medic
state
so
that
he
will
begin
to
tell
you
things
which
are
non-voluntary.
i
couldn't
find
anything
in
my
research
as
to
how
much
is
used
or
needed
in
order
to
bring
about
that
state.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
it
is
a
recognized
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
found
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
found
nothing
which
would
prescribe
as
to
what
dosage
should
be
used
in
order
to
achieve
the
--
the
--
to
the
alleviation
of
the
pain
of
withdrawal
symptoms.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
dr.
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
find
the
author
of
modern
drug
encyclopedia
and
therapeutic
index
refers
to
hyoscine
or
scopolamine
is
being
a
recognized
treatment
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
for
the
withdrawal
symptom
but
he
does
not
prescribe
the
dosage.
no,
he
doesn't.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
say
that
it
was,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
dr.
mansfield
was
cross-examined
very
thoroughly
on
that
question
and
dr.
proctor,
the
toxicologist
from
loyola
university
who
testified
on
behalf
of
the
defendant,
was
allowed
to
answer
very
extensely
--
extensively
a
hypothetical
question
which
went
into
these
areas.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
what
the
loyola
expert
said
was
that
--
he
thought
that
the
injection
or
the
dosage
of
the
hyoscine
was
normal
and
he
thought
that
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
he
just
said
the
normal
dosage
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
normal
adult
dosage
and
he
thought
that
the
injection,
the
phenobarbital
was
below
normal
and
on
the
basis
of
the
hypothetical
question
which
of
course
related
to
this
defendant,
he
thought
that
that
would
create
an
amnetic
condition,
create
amnesia.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
and
of
course
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh,
yes,
both
the
suppression
and
on
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
and
on
the
main
trial,
you
see
because
in
illinois
your
honors,
you
probably
remember
we
have
the
suppression
first,
the
competency
then
you
go
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
credibility.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
sir.
i
didn't
have
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
looked
at
them
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
per
curiam
which
is
the
majority
representing
five
men,
my
reaction
to
it
is
that
it
is,
that
it
has
been
canvassed
and
they
did
consider
it
and
it's
well
to
remember
that
it
can
escape
one
when
you
begin
reading
a
decision.
a
petition
for
rehearing
had
been
granted
in
that
case,
that
is
the
second
opinion,
the
one
that
now
appears
in
(voice
overlap)
illinois
second.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
i
doubt
very
much.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right
that
that
it's
a
--
it's
a
matter
practice,
sir
because
if
a
petition
rehearing
is
granted,
the
first
is
not
printed
but
it
is
the
second
which
is
printed.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
no,
it's
called
the
hyoscine
scopolamine.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
believe
oppo
--
i
believe
opposing
counsel
is
referred
to
one
article,
one
law
review
article
which
refers
to
the
use
of
that
drug
for
truth
serum
purposes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
sodium
pentathol
is
one
that
is
used.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
sodium
pentathol
is
a
truth
serum.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
one,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
two
use
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
there
--
it's
used
by
eye
doctors
for
the
purposes
of
developing
a
cycloplegia
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
you
move
objects
particularly
close,
your
eye,
the
side,
the
ciliary
muscles
they
called
it,
have
the
facility
of
focusing
rapidly,
in
other
words
so
you
don't
have
to
wait
a
while.
now,
the
problem
is
when
you're
go
into
an
eye
doctor
for
an
examination,
the
distance
doesn't
bother
him,
it's
to
keep
that
eye
stable
while
he's
working
on
you
so
they
have
medication
prepared
which
has
hyoscine
in
it,
the
function
of
which
is
to
paralyze
those
two
muscles
on
the
side
to
stop
that
accommodation
and
that's
the
reason
after
nine
examinations,
you
have
vomits
for
a
few
hours
and
the
problem
is
this.
you
cannot
see
close
but
you
can
see
far.
now,
going
back
to
this
case
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
went
over
rather
hurriedly,
sir
and
i
--
i
don't
--
i
--
i
don't
want
to
venture
an
opinion
as
to
what
its
use
is.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
it
would
be
in
something
in
that
area
but
i'm
not
too
positive
of
that.
now,
another
area
that
is
used
is
in
preanesthetic
treatment.
the
--
the
medical
books
tell
you
that
hyoscine
operates
immediately,
immediately
at
the
--
the
very
threshold.
here,
in
the
salivary
glands
and
that
is
why
hyoscine
is
used
in
medication
for
preanesthesia
to
dry
up
these
glands
here
to
prevent
the
flooding
of
your
lungs
while
you're
under
a
long
period
of
surgery.
the
medical
books
tell
us
that.
those
are
advanced
for
the
petitioner.
dr.
proctor
testified
to
that.
now,
what
did
mr.
townsend
said.
he
never
complained.
now,
here
is
a
person,
mind
you
that
is
claiming
that
a
drug
was
given
to
such
an
extent
that
it
affected
the
nervous
system
to
the
point
of
rendering
in
--
incapable
of
voluntary
action.
we
have
these
two
factors
which
become
operative
almost
immediately
and
still,
he
said
nothing
about
the
drying
of
the
throat
or
the
drying
of
the
lips
or
the
mouth.
and
when
he
came
to
his
testimony
as
to
how
he
saw,
he
testified
that
he
had
trouble
with
his
vision.
what
was
his
problem?
he
couldn't
see
far.
he
saw
close
alright,
but
not
far
which
was
the
exact
contrary,
the
exact
opposite
as
to
what
this
drug
should
do.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
not
necessarily.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
right
in
(inaudible).
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
they
do
in
the
general
area,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
gave
a
lot
of
thought
as
to
how
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
they
have
not
been
examined
and
for
this
reason.
as
i
was
going
to
tell
you
just
a
minute
ago
sir,
i
gave
a
lot
of
thought
to
the
question
as
to
how
far
we
would
go
in
our
exposition
of
the
matter.
then
we
thought
and
we
finally
reached
a
conclusion
that
on
the
basis
of
the
petition
and
the
argument
as
it
was
made
by
the
petitioner
that
we
were
dealing
actually
here
for
the
question
of
fact
as
it
was
presented
by
the
state
court
record.
in
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
--
with
your
permission
i
would
withdraw
the
adverb
essentially
or
not
even
substitute
primarily
like
i
will
concede
that
even
on
the
basis
pr
perhaps
the
authorities
advanced
by
mr.
leighton
that
that
condition
can
be
induced
with
a
cer
--
with
sufficient
doses.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
but
of
course,
it
is
our
position
that
no
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
your
honor,
if
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary
to
trial
and
as
to
your
second
question,
your
honor,
if
that
were
the
case,
i
assure
you,
we
would
not
be
here
this
morning
because
no
confession
would
have
been
taken
in
that
condition
existed
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
if
the
dosage
had
been
so
great
as
to
paralyze
the
--
the
man's
mental
abilities.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
according
the
defendant's
or
petitioner's
own
tes
--
witness,
five
to
eight
hours.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
he
signed
a
written
confession
the
following
afternoon
about
1:00
which
would
bring
us
in
1,
12,
13
hours
later,
that
was
on
saturday,
sometime,
he
was
taken
over
at
one
this
happen
in
the
afternoon
at
state's
attorney's
office
and
then
the
following
monday,
at
the
coroner's
inquest,
he
admitted
the
boone
murder
orally.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
we
say
they
are
valid.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
we
say
they
are
valid
as
we
say
the
written
the
confession
is
valid.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
to
the
confessions
--
or
let
me
put
this
way,
as
to
the
act
of
signing
the
confession
on
saturday
afternoon,
the
one
that
was
taken
to
previous
friday,
some
13,
14
hours
after
the
drug
had
been
administered,
i
say
that
that
would
be
admissible,
for
this
reason,
that
it
was
not
a
mere
act
of
signing.
the
evidence
at
the
trial
will
show
that
mr.
townsend
was
given
a
copy
of
the
confession
and
he
followed
as
the
confession
was
read
aloud
to
him
and
he
followed
it
page-by-page
and
signed
it.
and
by
the
testimony
of
his
own
witness,
the
drug,
if
it
had
any
detrimental,
any
radical
effects
had
already
spent
itself
we
say
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
expect
this,
your
honor,
if
that
--
that
might
be
true
if
there
were
just
a
mere
of
act
of
signing,
but
the
fact
that
you
take
the
petitioner
through
and
explore
every
area
of
the
confession,
if
he
didn't
remember
having
given
that
confession
the
night
before,
he
could
always
say,
“why?
this
isn't
mine.
i
never
did
this”
and
refuse
to
sign
it,
but
in
spite
of
that,
he
did
sign
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
his
testimony
was
that
he
felt
much
better,
but
he
was
still
oozy
that
in
general
is
his
--
is
his
testimony,
but
he
remembers
being
taken
over
the
state's
attorney's
office
and,
he
--
he
felt
oozy.
i
might
add,
and
of
course,
it's
brought
out
in
our
brief
on
his
question
of
amnesia,
during
the
first
trial,
the
stinson
trial,
the
petitioner
had
testified
that
he
remembered,
the
assistant
taking
the
confession
from
him,
the
signed
statement
on
friday
night
whereas
in
the
second
trial,
he
may
have
--
made
a
claim
that
he
didn't
remember
anything
and,
of
course,
that
was
brought
up
by
way
of
impeachment.
lest
you
gentlemen,
may
wonder
precisely
why
you
--
you
have
a
taking
of
the
confession
in
the
one
night
and
assigning
the
following
day,
gentlemen,
there
--
there's
--
it's
a
matter
of
mechanics.
the
court
reporter
has
no
typewriter
with
him,
and
he
has
to
go
to
the
office
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
he
transcribed
his
notes
and
that
is
the
usual
manner
and
that's
why
signing
will
take
place
sometime
a
day
later.
you
have
to
give
him
time
to
transcribe.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
yes.
that
was
the
oral
--
the
confession
that
was
given
and
it
was
(inaudible)
the
writing.
and
--
it
is
a
matter
of
practice.
we
take
the
man
through
it
again,
step-by-step
and
make
sure
he
understands
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
on
the
stinson
murder,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
everybody
was
surprised
and
particularly
defense
counsel
because
the
coroner's
inquest
record
is
here.
they
not
only
had
the
petitioner's
statement,
they
had
the
coat
of
the
decedent,
they
had
the
watch
of
the
decedent
and
the
shoes
of
the
decedent
which
that
--
townsend
had
sold
to
somebody
else
and
they
wound
up,
one
on
the
pawnshop
and
--
all
were
recovered.
in
spite
of
that,
the
man
was
acquitted.
i
think
it's
--
it's
an
interesting
commentary
in
the
face
of
that
evidence,
a
man
can
still
--
he's
given
a
fair
trial
and
if
there
--
there's
a
feeling
among
the
jury
that
he
wasn't
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
some
reason
or
other,
he
will
be
acquitted.
on
thompson,
no
statement
was
taken
at
all.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no
statement
was
taken
on
the
thompson
death
at
all
and
the
reason
that
it
wasn't
taken
was
that
the
assistant
state's
attorney
experienced
the
same
problem
with
thompson
on
friday
night
that
the
coroner
did
the
following
monday.
all
he
could
say
is,
“i
could
have.
i
could
have
done
it
but
i
don't
remember.”
and
the
thompson
inquest,
if
i
remember
correctly,
is
the
one
wherein
he
admitted
that
he
had
slugged,
if
you
will,
at
least
10
people
with
a
brick
as
he
came
up
usually
from
behind
and
then
attack
them.
the
johnson
--
johnson
as
the
gentleman,
who
was
struck,
got
up
--
he
was
found
outside,
got
up
stairs
to
his
flat
and
was
taken
to
(inaudible)
and
then
eventually
to
cook
county
where
he
died.
he
is
the
gentleman
that
had
stopped
off
for
drink
and
all
he
would
say,
“it
was
just
one
of
those
things.
it
was
an
accident.”
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know
because
mr.
johnson
is
not
here
whether
he
saw
his
assailant.
i
have
tied
to
analyze
the
coroner's
pathological
report
and
as
i
get
it,
the
--
the
blow
must
have
come
in
this
area
here,
happened
in
the
evening
or
in
the
dark
and
to
use
a
vernacular,
it
might
be
just
one
of
those
cases
where
a
person
did
not
know
what
hit
him
that
brought
his
attack.
a
statement
was
given
on
that
as
to
how
valuable
the
statement
would
be
if
it
were
admitted,
how
valuable
--
valuable
it
would
be
for
the
purposes
of
trial,
i
don't
know.
there
were
two
additional
statements
were
given.
those
are
here,
also,
in
support
of
the
additional
answer,
those
are
the
statements
of
mr.
martin,
the
laundryman,
and
mr.
anagnost,
the
insurance
man.
mr.
anagnost
is
the
man
who
remember
who
was
at
the
police
station
on
friday
night
and
they
had
to
show-up.
and
there's
no
doubt,
he
identified
the
wrong
person.
and
there's
been
a
quarrel
in
this
record
as
to
whether
some
of
the
cops
began
drumming
the
insurance
man
and
telling
him,
“well,
you
talked
--
you
identified
the
wrong
man”
and
that's
been
denied.
however,
the
anagnost
statement
was
the
first
statement
that
was
taken
at
which
time
mr.
townsend
admitted
that
he
had
assaulted
him
and
robbed
him
of
some
$110,
i
believe.
mr.
anagnost
was
an
insurance
man
of
the
metropolitan
insurance
company.
the
important
thing
about
it
is
that
mr.
anagnost
was
brought
in
to
the
room
there
and
townsend
identified
him
and
mr.
anagnost
never
denied
when
that
statement
was
being
taken
that
you've
got
the
wrong
man.
those,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
my
explanations.
i
--
as
i've
said
before,
the
--
the
strongest
case
by
far
was
the
stinson
case
and
still
it's
--
did
not
come
about
that
way.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
don't
know
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
anagnost
is
the
closest
in
the
sense
that
he
did
not
deny
when
he
was
brought
in.
now,
there
maybe
records
back.
there
were
going
back
to
1954,
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
and
they're
--
and
maybe
martin
was
brought
in.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
oh,
that's
quite
alright.
well,
thank
you
very
much,
gentlemen.
the
questions
that
were
asking,
i'm
sure
the
issue
would
have
been
explored
very
thoroughly.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
first
time
of
that
the
privilege
to
be
before
this
court
and
i
certainly
appreciate
your
courtesy.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
thank
you,
thank
you.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
have
tried
to
marshal
these
vast
expands
of
proceedings,
it
is
our
view
that
this
controversy
presents
two
basic
issues.
the
first
i
think
is
rather
easy
to
phrase
and
that
is
whether
or
not
judge
igoe
in
the
united
states
district
court
abused
his
discretion
when
upon
an
independent
examination
and
investigation
of
the
record
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
he
was
satisfied
that
this
petitioner
was
accorded
due
process
and
dismissed
the
petition.
the
second
one
is
much
more
difficult
to
phrase
and
that's
the
one
that
has
caused
the
problem
particularly
today.
as
i
read
the
petitioner's
briefs,
as
i
distill
his
arguments,
his
claim
appears
to
be
that
a
drug
induced
confession
is
violated
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
that
would
be
the
issue
then
i
would
not
be
standing
here
today.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
this
confession
was
drug
induced
and
nowhere,
nowhere
that
we
had
any
demonstration
at
all
from
this
petitioner
that
this
confession
and
the
amount
of
drugs
employed
here
could
have
possibly
in
any
way
at
all,
could
it
possibly
created
such
a
situation
in
his
personality
as
to
induce
a
confession.
before
i
examine
these
two
basic
propositions,
i
would
like
to
make
one
remark
by
way
of
preface.
as
this
court
well
knows,
the
final
judgment
in
this
proceeding
was
handed
down
in
april
of
1955
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county.
since
that
time,
we
have
had
one
post-conviction
hearing,
four
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
i'm
including
the
direct
appeal,
one
post-conviction
hearing
in
the
state
of
illinois,
four
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
this
proceeding.
we
have
great
many
papers
in
this
file.
i
will
try
to
summarize
and
analyze
the
proceedings.
i
have
experienced
the
scene
here
what
i
thought
it
was
a
rather
resourceful
use
of
the
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
in
general
of
post-conviction
remedies.
i
think
it's
my
responsibility
not
only
as
an
advocate
but
as
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
to
call
certain
basic
discrepancies,
contradictory
theories
to
the
attention
of
this
court.
in
doing
so,
i
want
this
court
to
know
and
to
understand
that
in
no
manner
of
safe
reform
i
--
am
i
imputing
any
form
of
criticism
upon
imposing
counsel.
as
i
can
truthfully
say,
i
respect
the
gentleman
as
a
lawyer
as
far
as
his
ability
is
concerned
and
through
my
activity
in
the
states
attorney's
office
i
have
got
to
know
him
as
a
friend.
however,
aside
from
the
issue
of
this
petitioner
in
this
case
and
i
just
want
to
rest
one
minute
on
this
point.
this
case
presents
a
problem
as
far
as
federal
habeas
corpus
is
concerned
and
i
would
like,
if
i
could
to
speak,
as
a
lawyer
rather
than
as
an
advocate.
and
i
would
like
to
report
an
incident
that
i
heard
several
years
ago
which
is
quite
applicable
that
during
a
course
of
a
television
interview
of
a
counsel
or
attorney
from
the
foreign
service
of
england,
where
he
was
interviewed
in
the
chicago
station
about
three
or
four
days
after
another
internationally
famous
death
case
in
this
country.
and
while
this
gentleman
was
discussing
the
pre-criminal
procedures
in
england,
he
made
one
observation
which
didn't
strike
me
until
i
realize
of
the
man
not
our
own,
the
man
of
the
english
bar
had
mentioned
it
to
us
and
that
was
this.
he
appreciated
the
concept
of
dualism
of
sovereignty
that
we
have
in
this
country,
the
several
individual
50
states
and
the
national
federal
state
that
we
have.
and
he
marveled
at
the
manner
in
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
guarantees
incorporated
therein
could
be
made
available
by
way
of
our
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
and
i,
as
a
lawyer,
think
it's
one
of
the
finest
inventions
that's
ever
been
made
in
the
field
of
jurisprudence,
but
i
think
we
must
always
remember
that
up
until,
i
believe
it
was
1867,
it
was
impossible
to
review
a
state
court
conviction.
it
was
not
until
the
enactment
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
act
that
this
could
be
done.
and
i
cannot
help
but
feel
that
if
federal
process
such
as
being
employed
here
to
the
point
that
one
could
very
well
consider
it
an
abuse,
i
cannot
feel
and
fear
that
possibly
congress
might
take
a
more
restrictive
view
someday
and
a
great
deal
of
damage
would
be
done.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
understand.
now,
i
address
myself
with
the
first
proposition
sir
and
that
is
whether
or
not
judge
igoe
abused
his
discretion.
during
the
course
of
the
last
argument
which
is
held
in
february
of
this
year
and
once
again
during
the
course
of
this
argument,
questions
have
been
propounded
by
several
members
of
this
court.
counsel,
what
did
you
want
to
put
in?
and
for
some
reason
or
other,
the
petitioner
and
his
counsel
just
have
not
been
able
to
tell
the
court
precisely
what
it
is.
this
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding
began
in
december
1958
before
judge
igoe.
it
began
before
jennings
v.
ragan
and
up
until
jennings
v.
ragan,
it
was
a
practice
and
what
everybody
thought
was
the
approved
practice
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
to
judge
or
to
apply
the
brown
versus
allen
criterion
from
the
opinion
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
and
not
the
record.
the
state
office
petitioned
on
that
basis
and
counsel
for
petitioner
in
addressing
judge
igoe
during
that
proceeding
and
that
transcript
is
a
part
of
this
record.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
found
on
page
26
of
the
transcript,
december
15,
1958.
and
this
is
counsel
speaking
and
quote,
“i
agree
with
your
honor
that
the
cases
on
this
subject
hold
that
your
honor
need
not
conduct
a
hearing
in
the
sense
of
witnesses
being
called.
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
we
could
submit
to
you
for
an
example
and
i
could
make
it
available
to
your
honor
quite
promptly.
i
could
make
available
to
you
the
court
reporter's
notes,
transcript
of
the
hearing
in
question.
i
could
present
that
to
you,
it
won't
take
me
long,”
in
december
1945,
as
i
said,
before
judge
igoe
pursued
the
practice
prior
to
jennings.
in
the
meantime,
jennings
was
decided
on
petition
writ
of
certiorari.
this
court
vacated
the
orders
of
the
lower
court
citing
jennings
v.
ragan.
now,
counsel
during
yesterday's
argument
made
some
suggestions
that
some
mandate
came
down
to
igoe
as
to
what
he
should
do.
as
i
read
that
brief,
minute
order,
there
was
no
secret
or
implied
mandate
contained
therein.
it
was
an
order
of
this
court
when
they
cite
jennings
and
it's
quite
obvious
to
everybody
that
to
practice
now
is
in
applying
the
brown
versus
allen
standard,
in
attempting
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
there
was
a
vital
flaw
in
a
state
court
proceeding.
the
district
court
judge
no
longer
can
rely
upon
the
opinion
alone.
he
must
go
to
that
record
and
that
is
the
practice
now.
and
that
record
came
up
and
judge
igoe
on
the
12th
of
june
took
that
record.
and
for
12
days
he
had
it
and
he
examined
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
i
was
--
i
don't
want
to
be
impertinent
sir,
but
i
was
subjected
to
it
in
another
death
case
which
this
court
had
recently
and
denied
certiorari.
as
long
as
you
ask
a
question,
i
wanted
to
develop
that
i
may
develop
it
right
now.
your
honor,
as
we
read
brown
versus
allen,
brown
versus
allen
is
an
opinion
of
caution,
of
caution
to
the
trial
judges
admonishing
them
that
it
is
only
in
the
extraordinary
cases
that
the
federal
court
will
end
the
theory.
in
line
with
your
question
sir,
i
suggest
and
i
urge
that
it
should
be
proper
practice
that
before
any
witness
be
called
that
the
state
be
entitled
to
know
whether
it
can
rely
upon
that
record
and
i
think
the
determination
as
to
whether
there
is
a
vital
flow
in
that
record
or
not
should
be
made
before
anything.
i'll
tell
you
what
happened
to
me
in
the
other
case.
i
filed
my
answer
and
set
this
up
to
brown
versus
allen
defense
up
as
the
first
affirmative
defense
and
i
requested
the
ruling
on
that
defense
before
we
go
any
further.
the
district
court
judge
took
it
under
advisory.
now,
i
have
a
problem
in
illinois
because
in
illinois
in
confession
matters,
as
a
matter
of
decisional
law,
any
law
enforcement
officer
who
was
in
any
way
associated
with
the
defendant
during
this
investigative
process
out
of
which
a
confession
arises
must
be
called.
in
other
words,
the
state
cannot
choose
say
five
out
of
14
and
say
we'll
go
with
five
witnesses
and
prove
up
the
voluntary
nature.
you've
got
to
call
all
of
them.
and
if
you
don't,
reverse
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial.
i'm
in
the
federal
district
court,
i
don't
know.
my
only
defense,
i'm
notified
within
48
hours
with
the
state
court
record
and
i
don't
know
whether
i
can
rely
upon
that
state
court
record
and
we
were
put
to
the
test
as
far
as
evidence
is
concerned.
so
i
was
forced
to
gamble.
i
was
forced
to
gamble
and
say,
“i
will
go
with
the
record.
i
will
not
examine
that
record
and
choose
my
witnesses
because
certainly,
i
won't
call
all
of
them
in
the
federal
court.”
so
i
respectfully
suggest
your
honors,
if
this
question
should
in
any
way
at
all
come
up
during
the
course
of
the
discussion
in
this
case,
i
think
that
it
is
sound
practice
consistent
with
the
spirit
of
federal
habeas
corpus
as
announced
by
this
court
in
brown
versus
allen
and
it
is
orderly
practice
that
before
any
evidence
be
given,
the
state
have
a
determination
from
the
district
court
that
he
is
--
the
district
judge
is
either
satisfied
or
he
is
dissatisfied
with
the
state
court
record.
and
if
he
is
dissatisfied
then
we
know
where
we
stand.
we
know
that
we
have
to
go
to
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
right
but
we'd
like
to
know.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
in
the
other
instance
which
i
recited
to
mr.
justice
brennan
during
--
in
answer
to
his
question,
i
didn't
know
because
i
was
told
expressly
i
would
take
that
under
advisement.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
what
will
happen
to
that
record
in
the
event
that
he
is
--
well,
that
would
be
a
case
of
dissatisfaction.
he
is
not
satisfied
with
what
he
had
in
the
record.
what
would
happen
to
that
record
would
depend
upon
the
trial
technique
of
the
attorney
representing
the
state
whether
he
is
going
to
introduce
it,
i
assume
that
he
would,
but
he
would
give
accumulative
evidence
also.
it
would
almost
develop
into
a
trial
de
novo
on
the
issue
but
i
don't
think
that
--
i
submit
that
the
state
should
not
be
led
dangling
on
that
issue.
we
get
--
and
the
statute
says
three
days
and
that's
just
about
what
we
get
and
it
takes
us
just
about
that
time
to
get
that
record
from
springfield
on
to
chicago.
and
gentlemen,
that's
all
we
have
when
we
go
to
a
federal
court,
that's
our
case
and
we
i
think
we're
entitled
to
know
whether
that
is
going
to
stand
after
the
case
or
not.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
say
yes
in
this
respect
that
judge
igoe
i
think
follow
the
procedure
as
outlined
by
brown
versus
allen.
and
he
exercised
the
discretion
on
the
basis
that
the
state
court
record
was
satisfied
that
all
the
issues
raised,
the
counsel
practically
conceded
off
before
--
off
before
this
courtroom
this
morning
when
he
said
the
record
that
we
have
here
is
no
different
than
it
was
when
i
was
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
that's
true.
there
had
been
a
few
changes
in
theory,
a
few
changes
in
technique
but
it's
the
same
record.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
i
hope
that
i
can
demonstrate
to
you
sir
in
the
course
of
this
argument
that
those
properties
were
thoroughly
explored
in
the
trial
court
and
examined
by
the
trial
court.
i'm
talking
about
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
now
by
way
of
the
experts
from
both
sides.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
fine.i'll
do
that
right
now
sir,
thank
you.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
all
issues
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
all
issues
i
believe
these
findings
read
were
fairly
raised
and
the
state
court
proceedings
were
heard.
it
was
accorded
due
process
and
also
as
independent
finding
on
the
basis
of
that
state
court
record
that
the
confession
in
question
was
voluntary.
that
was
his
reaction
to
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
find
nothing
in
the
record
which
would
indicate
that
judge
igoe
was
under
the
impression
that
occurred
in
the
rogers
v.
richmond
that
he
was
bound
by
the
state
court
determination.
in
other
words,
this
was
not
an
advocation
of
federal
judicial
power.
this
was
an
exercise
of
federal
judicial
power.
i
find
nothing
in
the
record
which
would
indicate
that
judge
igoe
had
a
feeling
that
he
had
to
go
along
with
the
state
finding
on
the
federal
constitutional
issue.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
to
go
behind
those
findings?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
are
you
talking
about
the
fact-finding
sir
or
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
you're
talking
about
fact-finding.
as
far
as
any
fact-finding
which
is
based
upon
disputed
evidence,
i
think
that
the
--
that
ends
the
issue
as
far
as
the
federal
courts
are
concerned
and
this
court
has
said
so
in
any
number
of
occasion.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
no,
if
you
have
undisputed
facts
and
apply
them
to
the
law,
no.
that
is
a
different
situation
such
as
we
have
in
rogers
v.
richmond
say
with
wrong
standard
was
applied.
the
standard
of
reliability
as
against
voluntariness
was
applied.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
don't
know.
really,
i
don't
know
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
believe
i
summarized
it
sir.
i
did
not
verbalize
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
original
record,
yes,
which
incidentally
is
the
only
record
we
should
know.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
coming
now
to
the
question
of
this
confession.
this
counsel
had
advised
you
the
petitioner
was
arrested
in
january
1,
1954
about
one
o'clock
in
the
morning.
about
an
hour
and
a
half
prior
to
that
time,
he
had
taken
some
heroin
having
been
an
addict
with
two
previous
years.
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
he
was
19
years
of
age,
he
had
been
examined
by
a
psychiatrist
and
found
to
be
legally
sane
but
of
low
border
intelligence.
and
the
psychiatrist
equated
his
psychological
finding
to
a
range
of
75
to
80
which
he
testified
compared
favorably
to
the
average
of
the
united
states
army.
he
was
asked
certain
questions
regarding
vital
statistics
and
for
about
a
half
hour
was
questioned
by
the
police
officers.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
right.
but
you'll
find
in
records
pages
1027
to
1030
that
he
translated
that
into
the
terms
of
mental
iq,
this
is
the
evidence.
the
range
is
from
75
to
80
for
petitioner,
though
it's
below
average,
it
compares
favorably
with
the
world
war
ii
average
mental
iq
of
78.
and
the
record
references
on
that
at
1027
to
1080.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
believe
that
applies
to
the
case
and
was
used
once
and
then
borderline
intelligence
was
used
in
another
time.
after
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
after
a
half
hour
interview,
period
of
questioning,
there
is
some
discrepancy
in
his
own
testimony
as
to
what
happened.
when
he
was
on
the
stand
during
the
preliminary
hearing
and
the
motion
to
suppress,
he
stated
that
he
talked
to
them
only
a
half
hour.
when
the
petitioner
testified
in
the
trial
before
the
jury,
he
claimed
that
they
talked
to
him
for
about
two
hours.
at
any
rate,
they
took
him
about
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
over
the
19th
district
and
that's
a
new
station.
the
record
so
shows
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
any
supposition
or
inference
that
was
made
here
that
this
man
was
taken
to
another
station
for
any
sinister
purpose.
if
you
read
the
record,
you'll
find
that
the
squad
led
by
officer
cagney
had
left
and
then
they
return
late
in
the
evening
and
the
answer
most
probably
is
that
they
were
on
the
night
shift
and
they
were
going
home.
he
remained
at
the
19th
district
police
station
until
approximately
8:25
p.m.
or
about
8:30
p.m.
of
january
1.
during
the
day,
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
he
was
not
questioned
by
anybody.
he
admitted
that
food
was
available
one
of
the
lock
up
keeper
testified
that
food
was
offered
to
him
and
he
refused
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
at
that
time,
no.
the
testimony
of
the
men
that
handled
him,
all
is
in
one
direction
that
they
didn't
observe
anything
unusual
about
him.
when
they
spoke
with
him,
he
spoke
coherently
and
he
exhibited
no
problems
at
all.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
withdrawal
problem
actually
set
in
around
--
i
would
have
to
say
about
10
minutes
to
9:00
sir
because
he
was
brought
back
in
the
19th
district
about
8:25
to
8:30
p.m.
in
the
first
of
january
and
then
we
have
to
show
off
which
the
record
reflects,
it
took
about
10
to
15
minutes.
and
then
they
began
to
talk
to
him
about
10
minutes
to
9:00
and
it
is
at
this
point
that
we
give
in
to
the
controversy
about
the
oral
statement.
one
that
is
testified
to
by
officer
corcoran
at
pages
647
to
650.
as
i
read
the
record,
we
would
--
we
indicated
that
the
oral
statement
was
given
somewhere
between
10
minutes
to
9:00
and
9
o'clock.
he
was
being
questioned
by
four
officers.
not
all
of
them
participated
but
they
were
there
one
time
or
another.
both
on
direct
examination
and
cross-examination
of
the
court
he
testified
that
when
he
was
asked
about
striking
a
man
of
38
in
michigan
and
robbing
him
that
the
petitioner
answered
in
the
affirmative.
now,
during
the
course
of
this
argument
both
yesterday
and
this
morning,
this
court
and
particularly
mr.
justice
clark
exhibited
a
considerable
amount
of
interest
in
that
oral
statement.
excuse
me.
and
if
i
remembered
counsel's
remarks
yesterday
since
we
attached
no
significance
to
that.
it
would
seem
to
create
the
impression
that
it
was
almost
non-existent.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
to
the
claim
of
the
oral
statement
that
was
made
somewhere
between
10
minutes
to
9:00
and
9
o'clock
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
your
pardon.
that's
right.
that
is
correct.
at
pages
1274
and
1275
to
some
very
explicit
and
specific
instructions
were
given
on
this
oral
statement.
at
page
75-a,
now
that
is
the
common
law
record
coming
out
of
the
state
of
illinois
which
is
also
part
of
this
record,
we
find
the
petitioner's
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
is
filed
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county.
and
under
point
two,
the
court
erred
in
admitting
into
evidence
the
oral
confession
made
by
the
defendant
because
it
was
involuntary
--
because
it
was
an
involuntary
confession.
the
issue
there
was
not
whether
there
was
an
oral
confession
but
whether
that
oral
confession
was
involuntary.
under
point
four
in
his
motion
to
new
trial,
the
petitioner
charged
that
the
court
erred
not
sustaining
the
defendant's
motion
to
suppress
the
confessions
and
admissions
both
oral
and
written.
there
is
also
a
blanket
charge
on
instructions.
now,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
invitation
during
the
course
of
the
last
argument
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
remember
the
record
and
i'm
trying
to
keep
all
these
marshals.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
expressed
contradiction,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
mention
of
it
made
but
i
don't
think
there
was
any
expressed
contradiction.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
right.
that
is
correct.
i
mean
corcoran
is
the
only
man
who
testified
to
that
and
that
can
be
explain
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
and
secondly,
you
had
a
situation
where
cagney
was
not
present
at
all
--
on
all
occasions
either.
he
was
not
in
the
room
consistently
during
that
entire
period.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
now
what
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
now,
one
final
observation
on
this
oral
admission
as
it
relates
to
the
state
court
proceeding
and
i
pointed
out
the
error
of
the
admission
of
that
oral
admission
was
made
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county.
on
his
writ
of
error,
on
his
appeal
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
you'll
find
that
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
not
a
single
instruction
is
challenged,
not
a
single
instruction.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
today,
the
view
is
that
in
fact
there
was
no
such
oral
admission
and
you
have
to
express
explicit
instructions
as
we
have
in
this
record,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
proper
objection
would
have
been
made
in
the
appellate
level
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
apparently,
there
must
have
been
some
satisfaction
that
that
testimony
was
given.
as
i
said
previously,
the
petitioner
became
ill
somewhere
between
10
minutes
to
9:00
and
9
o'clock.
it
is
quite
obvious
and
we
know
now
that
he
was
suffering
from
withdrawal
symptoms.
and
the
doctor
was
called
--
and
dr.
cagney
called
--
officer
cagney
called
the
doctor
who
was
dr.
mansfield,
the
police
surgeon.
during
the
course
of
yesterday's
argument,
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked
counsel
for
the
petitioner
a
certain
question
about
the
request
that
was
made.
and
this
came
about
in
this
fashion
as
i
remembered
counsel's
representation
originally
on
this
whole
thing
that
none
of
this
was
the
petitioner's
doing,
the
calling
of
a
doctor,
the
administration
of
drug
or
anything.
and
then
upon
the
question,
counsel
limited
and
says,
“well
choosing
this
doctor.”
if
the
court
will
check
the
record
at
page
110,
it
will
find
that
the
petitioner
on
direct
examination
on
a
preliminary
hearing
testified
that
he
had
been
talking
with
mr.
cagney
about
this
doctor
friend
of
his
and
he
was
so
ill
that
he
requested
mr.
cagney
to
call
this
doctor.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
one
that
cagney
was
talking
about
who
happens
to
be
the
dr.
mansfield,
the
police
surgeon
and
that's
the
only
man
that
they
used
as
far
as
we
know
and
they
have
no
question
for
anything
else.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
at
what
time?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
state's
attorney
arrived
after
the
doctor
called.
he
arrived
somewhere
between
9:15
and
9:30
and
the
doctor
arrived
about
9:45.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
jernigan.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
mr.
jernigan
wouldn't
have
questioned
him
and
if
i
have
been
in
the
same
position
that
mr.
jernigan
was,
i
wouldn't
have
questioned
him.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
because
i
would
be
cautious
not
knowing
what
it
is.
now,
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
that
caution
will
not
necessarily
render
this
confession
involuntary.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
wouldn't
know
anything
about
the
drug
and
that
would
be
the
primary
reason
that
i
would
stop.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
mr.
jernigan
has
so
testified
he
knew
nothing
about
the
treatment
that
was
administered.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
when
mr.
justice
goldberg
read
to
me,
he
read
the
--
i
was
making
my
answer
on
the
basis
of
what
he
read
to
me
from
my
brief.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
if
i've
known
that
it
has
affected
his
mental
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
if
i
know
that
he's
been
given
aspirin?
no,
i
would
have
questioned
him
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
question
him.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
would
question
him
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
know
something
about
aspirin.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
not
knowing
anything
else?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
just
as
it
did
appear
in
the
record.
now,
the
record
as
we
have
it,
mr.
jernigan
did
not
know
it
was
given
to
him.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
have
proceeded
to
interrogate
the
man.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
i
mean
that's
the
reason
the
doctor
was
called
to
alleviate
the
pain.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i'll
get
into
the
thompson
very
shortly.
now,
dwelling
on
this
choice
of
doctor
in
the
general
area,
there
has
been
an
impression
attempted
to
be
created
that
perhaps
his
entire
program
of
treatment
was
forced
upon
him.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
history
of
this
proceeding.
in
the
first
place,
when
this
petitioner
prosecuted
its
appeal
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
no
argument
was
made
that
the
drugs
were
involuntarily
administered
or
without
his
consent.
no
question
was
raised
as
to
the
purpose
for
which
the
drugs
were
given.
he
filed
this
petition
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
judgment
of
affirmance
and
that
was
done
in
august
3,
1957.
now,
during
the
course
of
that
petition,
the
petitioner
wrote
that
the
drug
used
is
known
under
two
names,
namely,
hyoscine
and
scopolamine.
and
the
petitioner
further
declared
to
this
court
and
i
quote,
“that
the
drugs
were
administered
to
petitioner
with
his
consent
and
with
the
avowed
intention
on
the
part
of
the
police
surgeon
to
alleviate
the
heroin
withdrawal
symptoms.
the
first
time,
the
very
first
time
in
the
history
of
this
case
that
you
get
a
switch
in
this
theory,
you
get
it
in
the
post-conviction
hearing.
and
incidentally,
that
post-conviction
hearing
is
the
very
item
which
gives
rise
to
the
proceeding
here.
that's
what
started
everything.
and
we
had
a
new
case
and
the
only
difference,
the
only
difference
between
the
record
as
it
stood
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
the
record
that
we
have
here
is
the
addition,
is
the
compilation
of
a
new
item
in
trial.
and
what
was
the
gist
of
that
post-conviction
hearing?
the
petitioner
was
trying
to
develop,
trying
to
claim
the
constitutional
right
to
a
label
just
as
simple
as
that.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
to
a
label.
and
the
position
he
took
there
was
that
not
only
was
a
drug
given
to
him
against
his
consent
without
his
consent
but
for
the
sole
purpose
of
extracting
a
confession
and
he
reported
that
to
this
court
in
a
second
petition
writ
of
certiorari,
less
than
one
year
after
the
first
was
filed.
now
gentleman,
i
have
looked
at
this
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
reconcile
the
statements
and
i
can't
understand,
i
can't
understand
how
there
can
be
consent
at
one
time
and
lack
of
consent
with
the
other.
because
when
that
drug
was
administered
in
the
night
of
january
1,
1954,
it
was
administered
only
once
and
the
consent
or
lack
of
the
consent
occurred
only
once.
how
can
you
say
and
tell
a
court
in
one
term,
it
is
given
for
a
proper
purpose
with
my
consent
and
on
the
second
term,
it
is
given
for
an
improper
purpose
and
without
my
consent.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
his
first
petition
writ
of
certiorari
mr.
justice
white
reports
--
indicates
that
hyoscine
and
scopolamine
“are
different
names
for
the
same
drug”.
you
read
that
first
petition
that's
on
file
in
this
court.
i
mean
it's
quite
obvious
that
he
knew.
he
knew
it
was
given
to
him.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
there's
no
indication
that
the
doctor
told
him.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
didn't
get
that
sir,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no,
it
doesn't.
but
i
think
it
should
make
a
difference
to
this
court
for
this
reason.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
don't
think
its
immaterial
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
understand.
but
this
is
a
man's
representation
and
who
knows
better
than
the
petitioner
himself
whether
he
consented
to
something
and
he
is
presenting
an
issue
to
you
namely
coerced
confession
of
which
the
petitioner
himself
is
the
judge
and
the
best
that
this
court
can
do
is
review
the
record
and
if
it
goes
along
with
the
petitioner
at
all,
it
must
rely
upon
his
sincerity,
upon
his
reliability.
now,
if
he
is
going
to
make
one
statement
in
one
pleading
in
this
court
in
one
direction
and
the
opposite
in
the
other
direction
or
does
this
leave
the
petition
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
quotation
reads
that
the
drugs
were
administered
to
petitioner
with
his
consent
and
would
be
a
valid
intention
on
the
part
of
the
police
surgeon
to
alleviate
the
heroin
withdrawal
symptom.
prior
to
that
point
at
page
4
of
the
petition,
the
description
of
hyoscine
and
scopolamine
are
given
and
it
is
there
conceded
that
they
are
different
names
for
the
same
drug.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes
sir,
he
was
for
approximately
two
years
prior
to
his
arrest.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
no,
there
was
no
testimony
attempted
to
be
adduced
in
that
point
at
all.
now,
the
administration
that
was
given
here
was
1/230
per
grain
of
scopolamine
together
with
1/8
grain
of
phenobarbital.
now
in
his
brief,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
set
out
a
great
number
of
medical
authorities.
we
have
examined
and
reviewed
the
same
authorities
in
our
brief.
and
this
1/230
for
the
grain
is
approximately
0.27
milligram
of
scopolamine
and
the
normal
therapeutic
dose
as
reported
by
petitioners
own
authority
is
0.5
milligram.
during
the
course
of
number
of
questions
here
and
i
believe
it
was
yesterday
afternoon,
counsel
stated
flatly
that
he
was
not
making
any
claim
of
incompetency
of
trial
counsel
but
did
suggest
that
perhaps
trial
counsel
was
not
as
well
equipped
as
he
should
have
been
to
conduct
the
examination.
well
we
disagree
and
disagreed
most
heartedly.
i
think
if
you'll
examine
the
cross-examination
of
dr.
mansfield,
the
cross-examination
of
dr.
hoffman
as
well
as
the
direct
examination
of
dr.
proctor,
you'll
find
that
john
branion
--
mr.
branion
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
properties
of
the
drug.
there's
one
important
item
which
is
common
to
all
three
examinations.
when
he
cross-examined
dr.
mansfield,
he
wanted
to
know
whether
this
drug
was
used
for
twilight
sleep.
when
he
examined
dr.
proctor,
the
same
question
was
propounded
on
direct
and
when
he
examined
dr.
hoffman,
the
neurosurgeon,
the
same
question
was
propounded
in
cross-examination.
and
that's
very
significant
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
this
is
the
trial,
that's
correct.
and
this
is
very
significant
because
this
use
of
drug
in
the
field
of
narco-analysis
and
narco-interrogation
began
in
obstetrics.
it
began
in
the
early
1900s
and
the
doctor
from
texas
came
upon
a
flight
suddenly.
the
twilight
sleep
was
developed
during
the
early
1900s
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
dr.
gauss,
g-a-u-s-s
is
actually
the
man
who
developed
the
technique.
and
dr.
gauss'
formula
in
order
to
induce
twilight
sleep
was
1/6
grain
of
morphine
plus
1/140
grain
of
scopolamine.
now,
that's
1/140
of
grain
scopolamine
is
more
of
course
than
1/230
of
the
grain.
three
quarts
of
an
hour
later,
1/140
of
grain
is
administered
again,
scopolamine
alone.
and
a
half
hour
later,
the
memory
tester
began.
in
other
words,
the
time
of
the
first
injection,
they
say
a
cup
was
shown
to
the
person.
then
you
come
back
and
show
the
person
the
cup
and
if
they
still
remember
the
cup,
that
means
that
the
degree
of
anesthesia,
and
that
is
what
narco-analysis
and
narco-interrogation
is.
that's
an
anesthetic.
when
you
read
the
scientific
journal,
they
speak
of
dissenting
to
level
to
bring
him
down.
the
degree
of
anesthesia
is
not
high
enough
so
they
keep
administering
the
drug
until
they
reach
that
point.
in
1916,
a
man
by
the
name
of
dr.
house
doing
some
obstetric
work
in
ferris,
texas;
it
was
during
the
course
of
delivery
and
he
had
a
woman,
mother,
prospective
mother
under
twilight
sleep.
he
was
talking
to
her
husband.
and
he
asked
her
the
questions
--
asked
him
the
questions
and
he
answered
them.
he
answered
them
truthfully.
but
the
point
is
that
when
she
came
out,
she
had
total
amnesia
for
the
incident.
she
didn't
remember
it
at
all.
but
immediately
dr.
ferris
felt
that
he
had
something
in
the
field
of
--
i
don't
want
to
call
it
psychiatry
because
in
those
days,
psychiatry
was
not
--
it
was
just
pioneering.
he
felt
that
something
could
be
done.
the
newspapers
hit
upon
it
and
we
had
the
famous
phrase
“truth
serum”.
of
course
all
your
scientific
man,
even
to
this
day
throw
their
hands
up
at
the
term
or
phrase
“truth
serum”.
one
school
did
take
it
on
and
that
was
the
school
of
crime
detect
--
crime
detection
laboratory
which
was
attached
to
the
northwestern
university
law
school.
we
have
there
a
man
by
the
name
of
goddard
who
led
that
group.
he
was
associated
and
assisted
by
muehlberger
and
keeler.
and
keeler
later
ran
a
crime
detection
lab
and
they
used
this
technique.
they
used
it
on
25
volunteers
and
he
made
a
study
of
it
which
is
reported
in
1932
i
believe
in
hygeia
and
his
recommendation
was
that
in
order
to
use
scopolamine
for
purposes
of
narco-analysis
or
narco-interrogation.
this
is
the
method.
your
initial
injection
1/100
of
a
grain
hypodermically
and
then
you
have
additional
hypodermical
or
hypodermic
injections
of
1/200
of
a
grain
every
20
minutes
for
an
average
of
three
to
six
injections
until
the
subject
reaches
the
proper
stages
of
their
interrogation.
the
important
thing
to
remember
that
under
this
system,
it
is
given
on
an
anesthesiologist
and
the
time
element
is
anywhere
from
an
hour
and
a
half
to
three
hours
and
you
have
an
average
here.
i
withdraw
that.
i'm
sorry.
and
your
initial
injection
of
1/100
is
actually
more
than
twice
that
was
administered
here
on
the
first
of
january
and
then
for
three
to
six
additional
injections,
you
have
1/200
of
a
grain
which
continues.
if
you
total
this
out
gentlemen
you
have
an
average
here
of
10
times
the
amount,
10
times
the
amount
that
was
administered
to
this
particular
individual
in
order
to
achieve
any
kind
of
narco-analysis
which
is
necessary
in
order
to
induce
a
confession
such
as
is
claimed
by
the
petitioner
in
this
particular
incidence.
now
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
your
pardon.
this
is
in
the
literature,
yes.
actually,
this
part
of
the
research
is
triggered
by
several
questions
of
mr.
justice
black
during
the
course
of
our
last
argument.
now,
what
are
the
other
uses
for
--
of
scopolamine?
those
are
analyzed
in
the
medical
authorities
which
have
been
advanced
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
a
very
common
use
is
the
preparation
for
anesthesia,
preanesthesia;
the
reason
being
that
it
contracts
the
salisbury
muscle
that
maintains
dryness.
it
is
used
in
the
field
of
ophthalmology
to
produce
psychoplegia.
as
i
explain
the
last
time
to
triple
or
to
paralyze
the
accommodation
of
the
lens
to
enable
the
examination
so
that
you
cannot
see
near
what
you
can
see
far.
an
interesting
thing,
i
believe
its
fine
reports
that
it
was
used
by
the
air
force
for
air
sickness.
and
the
amount
of
dose
that
was
given
was
three-tenths
of
a
milligram
and
study
shows
that
it
was
given
without
any
impairment
of
military
efficiency.
i
think
that's
quite
significant.
you
not
only
have
a
man
flying
a
plane,
this
is
war
time
activity
because
after
all,
the
airplane
during
war
time
is
secondary.
it's
only
a
means
of
transportation.
you
have
a
pilot
and
must
maintain
formations.
you
have
a
navigere
that
must
make
mathematical
calculations,
you
have
a
bombardier
that
must
make
mathematical
calculations
and
you
have
a
gunner
whose
reflex
is
better
be
in
top
shape.
now
gentlemen,
do
you
think
for
one
moment
as
these
studies
indicate
that
the
air
force
have
administered
three-tenths
of
a
milligram
if
at
any
time
that
have
endanger
tripling
those
men,
their
reflexes
to
the
point
that
they
could
not
operate
efficiently
and
it's
only
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
phenobarbital,
no.
at
least
doctor's
finding
does
not
report
that.
the
phenobarbital
actually,
even
as
dr.
proctor
testifies
a
very
low
dose.
this
is
not
in
the
record.
this
is
part
of
inquiries
i
have
made
myself
with
several
doctors.
and
the
purpose
of
this
is
i
think
there
are
two
consistent
drugs.
the
phenobarbital
going
with
scopolamine
didn't
do
anything
at
all.
what
it
did
do,
it
guaranteed
a
long
ranged
sedation.
in
other
words,
give
him
rest
into
the
next
morning
because
he
had
these
tremendous
pains.
it's
the
scopolamine
which
in
this
treatment
and
incidentally
that
is
one
of
the
tricks
advanced
by
the
petitioner.
he
said
--
he
states
the
fact
that
the
use
of
scopolamine
is
a
recognized
narcotic
withdrawal.
it
is
the
scopolamine
which
acts
quickly
and
you've
got
to
do
it
because
you've
got
these
muscles
down
here
which
are
contracting
and
the
phenobarbital
carries
you
along
the
line.
now,
much
has
been
said
here,
cases
tried
defended
on
the
theory
that
amnesia
had
developed.
now,
the
key
to
this
treatment
that
uses
scopolamine
narco-analysis
is
amnesia.
if
you
read
the
petitioner's
testimony,
it's
indeed
significant
that
he
remembers
the
favorable
items
but
forgets
the
unfavorable.
and
there
is
no
record
or
no
history
of
the
partial
amnesia
in
this
type
of
treatment.
in
this
trial,
namely
the
boone
trial,
he
says
he
did
not
remember
the
assistant
state's
attorney
taking
the
statement.
the
record
will
show
and
he
was
impeached
by
the
--
by
his
testimony
in
stinson
trial
where
he
did
remember
the
state's
attorney.
he
remembered
in
the
following
morning
on
saturday
when
he
signed
the
statement
and
remembered
him
to
be
the
same
man
that
talked
to
him
the
previous
night.
his
testimony
on
psychoplegia,
dr.
proctor
his
own
witness
said,
“you
can't
see
near
you
can
see
far.”
this
testimony
is
exact
reverse.
pre-anesthesia,
the
quickest
reaction
is
thirst.
no
complaint
of
thirst
here
at
all.
and
i
think
the
most
significant
statement
that
we
have
in
this
record
is
when
he
requested
the
doctor
the
second
time
that
was
on
sunday.
he
told
the
doc,
he
says,
“doc,
those
didn't
do
me
any
good,”
words
of
that
effect
which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
there
was
hardly
a
threshold
of
fact
there
and
certainly
one
which
does
not
go
to
the
nervous
system.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
at
midnight.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
that
was
he
says.
there
was
a
dispute
--
there's
a
dispute
in
the
evidence
on
that.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
that's
(voice
overlap),
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
it
was
a
--
he
gave
1/8
grain
at
the
time
the
doctor
visited
him
and
he
left
one-quarter
of
grains
if
i
remembered
correctly.
incidentally
gentlemen,
his
own
testimony
indicates
that
the
doctor
spent
but
a
few
moments
with
him.
when
you
examine
the
studies
in
the
field
of
narco-analysis,
that
is
a
long
process
just
like
any
anesthesia.
i
see
that
my
warning
sign
has
flashed
and
i
would
like
close
with
this
remark.
many
questions
have
been
asked,
many
incisive
questions.
but
the
question
was
propounded
yesterday
for
the
first
time
and
also
picked
up
today
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
later
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
weren't
all
these
matters
before
the
trial
judge
and
the
jury
and
aren't
you
asking
us
to
make
a
finding
of
fact.
gentlemen,
basically
that
is
the
decisive
question
in
this
case
because
if
this
court
is
to
give
this
petitioner
the
relief
that
he
asks
for,
he
must
of
necessity
ask
this
court
to
substitute
his
judgment
for
that
of
the
trial
judge
who
saw
the
witnesses
on
the
preliminary
of
the
jury
who
saw
the
witness.
and
he
must
ask
this
court
to
ascribe
more
credibility
to
dr.
proctor
his
expert
as
against
dr.
mansfield
and
dr.
hoffman,
and
incidentally
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
his
own
brief
he
conceded
that
dr.
mansfield
was
entitled
to
be
accorded
more
weight
for
the
testimony
was
entitled
to
be
accorded
more
weight
than
that
of
dr.
proctor.
now
that,
gentlemen,
to
me
is
the
case
here.
it's
a
question
of
fact.
we
do
not
have
an
undisputed
drug-induced,
drug-influenced
confession
here.
we
have
a
confession
that
was
taken
and
acclaimed
is
made
that
it
was
drug-induced
and
that
claim
was
made
seven
years
ago
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
and
that
fact
issue
was
found
against
him.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
dr.
hoffman
gave
that
testimony.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
surely,
page
1173.
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
when
i
give
this
page,
i'm
referring
to
the
transcript.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
there
are
several
(voice
overlap)
there.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
there.
page
1173,
dr.
hoffman
testified
scopolamine
or
hyoscine
are
the
same
and
that
was
the
big
issue
in
the
post-conviction
hearing
in
illinois
because
then
the
claim
was
made
that
was
given
against
this
consent
for
a
sinister
purpose
and
on
top
of
that
that
dr.
mansfield
withheld
this
information.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
told
the
petitioner,
“well,
you
don't
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
label.”
the
thing
that's
important
to
us
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
the
drug,
its
nature
and
its
effect
and
that
was
before
us.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
he
testified
surrebuttal
during
the
trial
before
the
jury.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i'll
get
it
for
you
in
a
minute
sir.
that
was
on
cross-examination
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
first
of
all,
i
have
that
in
my
notation.
thank
you
very
much
for
the
suggestion
because
i
recall
the
question
by
mr.
justice
brennan
yesterday
as
to
whether
those
are
before
the
trial
court.
of
course,
the
easiest
way
to
find
out
whether
they're
before
the
trial
court
is
to
look
at
the
record
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
you'll
find
it's
not
in
there
and
it's
true
that
judge
butler
did
make
some
inquiries.
but
he
had
to
make
the
inquiry
to
rule
on
the
objection
and
the
best
that
judge
butler
did
find
out
was
that
there
were
other
crimes.
but
judge
butler
this
day
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
doesn't
know
what
those
crimes
were
and
neither
did
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
because
the
petitioner
kept
them
out
and
he
kept
them
out
in
the
grounds
where
they're
highly
prejudicial.
now,
they
are
the
stinson,
the
thompson
and
the
johnson
item.
johnson
is
a
gentleman
that
was
coming
home
and
stopped
at
the
local
pub
and
it
was
late
in
the
evening.
and
he
was
hit
--
as
i
read
the
medical
history
about
here.
he
did
not
die
immediately.
and
during
the
course
of
--
certain
statement
is
made,
he
characterized
his
difficulty
as
a
result
of
an
action.
it
is
true
that
during
the
course
of
the
interrogation
on
january
1,
1954,
the
petitioner
did
confess
to
the
johnson
murder
of
the
johnson
assault
which
later
resulted
in
murder.
now,
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
develop
now
the
idea
that
there
was
no
murder
because
the
man
said,
it
was
an
accident.
well,
i
said
the
last
time
and
i
say
once
again,
judging
the
course
of
the
thrust
of
the
blow
and
it
was
in
the
evening
as
i
recall
it,
how
does
he
know
what
hit
him.
you're
walking
alone
the
street
that
could
happen
to
anybody
and
mr.
johnson
would
not
be
the
first
case
of
a
man
who
was
struck
in
the
head
and
felt
that
was
a
result
of
an
accident
and
later
was
found
to
be
the
result
of
a
murder.
as
far
as
the
thompson
case
is
concerned,
that's
the
one
where
he
didn't
remember.
and
i
believe
that's
the
case
where
the
hassle
developed
between
officer
cagney
and
the
deputy
coroner.
and
the
hassle
developed
precisely
over
this.
the
deputy
coroner
had
suggested
that
the
officer
go
out
and
get
some
more
information.
well,
these
were
december
1958
assaults
and
murders.
i
think
it
appears
in
the
record
certainly
in
the
coroner's
inquest
that
officer
cagney
had
been
working
since
that
time
and
he
felt
as
though
that
he
had
made
the
case.
and
it's
over
this
remark
about
his
going
on
to
get
some
more
dope
--
dope
by
mean
information.
that
was
the
language
that
was
used
that
officer
cagney
became
quite
excited.
now,
it's
true
that
the
petitioner
was
not
represented
by
a
counsel
here.
under
the
illinois
law,
the
purpose
and
that's
primary
the
problem.
the
purpose
of
an
inquest
to
determine
the
cause
of
death
and
if
there'd
be
a
felonious
death,
the
statute
requires
that
person
who
is
suspected
of
causing
it
be
held
over
the
grand
jury.
that's
the
very
limited
power
with
--
of
an
illinois
coroner's
inquest.
his
sister
was
there.
a
point
was
made
yesterday
about
his
reluctance
to
testify.
he
was
warned.
now
if
you
read
the
inquest,
there's
a
pattern
there.
when
they
said,
“do
you
want
to
testify?”
he
either
stood
mute
and
i
believe
--
or
i
think
he
stood
mute
both
times
or
shook
his
head
no.
then
he
asked,
“do
you
want
to
tell
the
story?”
the
answer
was
“yes”.
now,
the
stinson,
i
don't
know
what
happened
in
the
stinson
case
and
if
you
look
at
the
case
on
the
evidence
and
you
think
the
state
would
never
have
any
trouble.
the
man
stole
the
shoes.
he
stole
the
overcoat.
he
stole
the
watch.
by
the
man
i'm
talking
about
the
petitioner.
they
have
the
man
to
whom
he
sold
the
--
to
whom
he
gave
the
shoes
and
they
also
have
the
man
to
whom
he
sold
the
watch
and
he's
also
--
he
gave
the
coat.
they
go
to
trial.
they
go
to
a
jury
with
the
finding
of
not
guilty.
i
appreciate
counsel's
argument.
i
mean
he
wants
to
ascribe
some
degree
of
infallibility
to
that
particular
jury.
he
was
able
to
look
into
townsend's
mind
and
say
that
confession
was
not
voluntary
therefore,
none
of
them
are
voluntary.
the
best
that
i
can
say
mr.
chief
justice
on
that
is
that,
to
me,
it
establishes
one
thing.
i've
mentioned
it
before
and
i
think
it's
worth
mentioning
again
that
even
in
cook
county,
illinois,
if
for
some
reason
or
other
in
what
the
reason
is
here
but
even
in
cook
county,
illinois,
a
jury
has
some
doubt
regardless
of
how
heinous
the
crime,
they'll
come
back
with
the
verdict
of
not
guilty.
and
i
think
when
you
examine
that
in
this
proper
perspective,
it
points
out
that
there
is
fairness.
and
that
we
do
not
have
a
climate
of
sequestering
and
enforcing
people
in
this
situation
such
as
it's
been
implied
here
in
one
remark
or
another.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
no.
the
only
offer
that
i
can
find
mr.
justice
harlan,
you'll
find
in
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
of
june
12,
1959
which
is
here,
page
64.
and
at
that
time,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
informed
the
court
that
he
desire
to
recall
some
state
witnesses
and
ask
them
one
or
two
questions
about
it,
just
one
or
two.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
the
record
before
judge
igoe
after
the
jennings
remand.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct.
it's
june
12,
1960
--
1959,
i'm
sorry.
you'll
find
that
at
page
64.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
well,
as
i
remember
that
sir.
at
that
time,
judge
igoe
advised
the
petitioner
that
he
had
the
state
court
record
and
that
he
was
going
to
study
it.
now,
how
far
he
had
gone,
i
don't
know.
it's
been
a
little
while
since
i
read
the
transcript
of
the
proceeding,
how
far
he
went
in
his
remarks.
but
he
felt
that
he
showed
--
look
at
the
record
first
and
it
was
this
point
as
i
remember
it,
the
counsel
said,
“well,
i
just
want
to
recall
some
state
witnesses
and
ask
them
one
or
two
questions.”
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
right.
now
this
--
this
information
arose
out
of
your
question
and
your
question
in
the
last
argument.
it
was
embodied
in
a
supplemental
memorandum,
and
at
that
time,
i
searched
those
two
transcripts
rather
carefully
and
i
tried
to
give
the
petitioner
every
benefit
of
the
doubt.and
this
is
the
best
i
can
come
up
with.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
june
12
until
the
24th.
he
had
the
state
court
record
and
then
he
down
with
the
decision
in
the
24th.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
i
recall
not
sir
and
he
made
no
such
indication
and
i
have
to
--
i
--
that's
a
qualified
no.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that's
right.
a
pleading
was
advanced
about
--
based
upon
brown
versus
allen
and
judge
igoe
determined
that
issue
first
because
that
was
the
position
the
state
took.
that's
how
he
got
into
the
additional
answer
in
this
court.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
that
is
correct
in
its
entirety.
and
the
reason
being,
additional
items
are
not
there
as
i
said
before
was
because
the
petitioner
in
fact
will
be
kept
alone.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
the
way
the
--
i
think
both
of
you
gentlemen
are
talking
about
different
items.
you're
talking
about
the
coroner's
inquest,
the
pleadings
of
paragraphs
18
in
that
area
and
mr.
justice
clark,
i
believe,
he's
talking
about
the
confession.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
first
time
that
i
remember
sir
that
an
attempt
was
made
to
bring
the
confessions
of
other
crimes
in
the
coroner's
inquest
picture
into
this
proceeding
was
in
this
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
i
don't
remember
it
being
advanced
any
other
time
on
the
state
court's
side.
and
the
reason
that
it
was
into
coming
back
to
your
remark
was
--
is
this.
during
the
course
of
both
the
preliminary
hearing
and
the
motion
to
suppress
as
well
as
the
hearing
before
the
jury,
the
counsel
called
the
defendant
for
the
petitioner,
mr.
branion,
conducted
an
examination
which
in
the
view
of
the
state's
attorney
was
rather
broad
and
he
sought
to
use
this
inquest
for
indecent
purposes
and
he
was
stopped.
and
the
reason
he
was
stopped
was
because
counsel
said
they're
highly
prejudicial.
now,
that
characterization
was
somewhat
cast
aside
yesterday
by
opposing
counsel
but
i
think
anybody
experienced
in
trial
or
when
a
lawyer
gets
up
and
said
it's
highly
prejudicial,
he
knows
what
it
is
and
he
doesn't
want
it
in
there.
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
it
was
the
realization
that
you
have
voluntary
disclosures.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
as
i
said
before,
mr.
justice
harlan
and
as
i
remember
it,
that
reference
that
i
gave
you
is
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
--
constitutes
the
only
offer
that
was
made
to
judge
igoe
after
the
remand
as
to
what
his
intensions
were.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edward
j.
hladis
thank
you,
your
honor.
