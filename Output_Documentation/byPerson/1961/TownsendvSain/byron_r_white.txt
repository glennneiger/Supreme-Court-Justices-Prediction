justice
byron
r.
white
but,
he
had
been
questioned?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
he
said
was
that
he
wouldn't
have
pressured
him
if
he
had
known
that
he
had
a
drug
which
would
affect
his
mental
process
for
that
instance.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
that
he
would
have
questioned
him
and
his
ability
in
behalf
of
this
drug.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
have
questioned
him
if
you
had
known
that
he
had
a
drug
that
affected
his
mental
process.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
had
known
that
he
has
been
given
an
aspirin.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
difference
in
the
two
instances
that
what
suggested
the
defendant
might
have
known
it
was
given
to
him.
he
might
have
consented
to
have
his
objection
but
he
might
not
have
consented
the
attempts
to
being
injected
this
certain
kind
of
a
drug,
he
didn't
know
what
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
evidence
--
does
the
record
indicate
anything
at
all
whether
he
knew
what
he
was
being
injected
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
(voice
overlap)
immaterial
what
anybody
has
suggested
about
this
sense,
the
record
doesn't
show
one
way
or
another,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
record
doesn't
show
one
way
or
another
whether
he
consented
to
it,
was
it
--
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
show
one
way
or
another
whether
he
knew
that
he
was
being
injected
with
hyoscine?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
it
makes
further
immaterial
what
somebody
else
says
then
about
the
consent
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
record
is
silent
in
either
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
the
first
place,
you
can
just
say
he
consented
to
do
an
injection
of
hyoscine
or
just
the
injection?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
this
phenobarbital.
justice
byron
r.
white
judge
igoe
took
that
under
consideration?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
did
indicate
one
way
or
another
whether
he
thought
he
had
the
power
to
deal
it
with
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
confessions
of
these
other
crimes,
were
there
any
written
confessions?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
the
trial
of
this
case
--
the
preliminary
hearing
before
judge
on
the
most
of
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
question
would
be
different
if
there
was
a
direct
confession.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
that
the
confession
was
that
--
was
the
other
crime
(voice
