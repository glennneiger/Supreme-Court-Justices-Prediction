mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
replying
to
the
last
argument
advanced
by
the
respondent
to
the
effect
that
only
new
york
has
jurisdiction
over
this
matter
and
that
to
affirm
the
position
or
to
take
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
this
particular
case
would
lead
to
conflict
among
the
various
states.
and
this
is
not
a
new
problem
with
this
court,
conflict
of
regulation
between
the
various
states.
it's
not
a
new
problem
in
the
field
of
insurance
regulation
as
witnessed
the
watson
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1954.
there,
the
state
of
connecticut
or
massachusetts
issued
or
had
a
law
that
provided
that
contracts
issued
there
should
not
have
a
provision
allowing
direct
action.
the
policy
was
entered
into
in
new
york
or
in
connecticut,
i
--
i
believe
it
was
entered
into
connecticut.
in
the
state
where
the
law
was
that
the
contract
could
not
provide
for
a
direct
action.
what
did
louisiana
do
in
that
case?
louisiana
was
allowed
to
apply
its
own
direct
action
law
in
that
case,
obviously,
a
conflict
of
regulation,
conflict
of
policy
between
the
state
of
connecticut
on
the
one
hand
and
the
policy
of
the
state
of
louisiana
on
the
other.
obviously,
the
claxton
case
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
black
a
moment
ago
has
that
same
conflicting
policy
regulation
involved.
the
similar
case
dealing
with
--
in
the
field
of
insurance
is
the
case
of
state
farm
versus
duel
in
which
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
allowed
to
apply
its
requirements
as
to
reserves
not
only
on
policies
written
in
wisconsin
but
all
over
the
united
states.
certainly,
that
conflicted
or
could
have
conflicted
with
regulations
from
other
states.
so
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
--
that
perhaps
there
might
be
conflict
with
other
states
policies
in
the
field
of
insurance.
it's
not
enough
to
--
to
speculate
on
that
field.
further,
it
might
be
added
that
there's
no
showing
in
this
case
that
any
possible
conflict
does
exist.
mr.
vickery,
the
counsel
for
respondent
also
castigated
the
petitioners
for
bringing
up
certain
economic
possibilities
that
we
rely
upon
in
this
case.
he
said
it's
not
certain
that
those
circumstances
will
occur.
but
we
submit
that
the
same
was
true
in
the
watson
case
in
the
economic
circumstances
which
the
court
dwelt
upon
in
that
case.
certainly,
they
were
not
certain
to
occur.
but
it
was
taught
in
that
case
that
the
state
policy
was
sufficient
and
that
the
fact
that
they
might
occur
was
sufficient
to
allow
the
state
policy
to
control.
now,
should
the
allgeyer
line
of
decisions
be
overruled?
but
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
it's
not
necessary
to
overrule
the
specific
case
of
--
of
the
specific
allgeyer
case
in
this
decision.
the
facts
were
not
on
--
on
all
force.
there,
the
louisiana
court
was
dealing
with
a
transaction,
a
risk
that
was
only
momentarily
within
the
state.
in
fact,
the
--
the
opinion
reflects
that
actually,
the
insurance
did
not
take
effect
in
that
case
until
it
became
a
marine
risk.
therefore,
suggesting
that
--
that
no
time
was
the
insurance
--
their
insurance
policy
there
involved
insurance
on
a
louisiana
risk
as
such.
should
the
doctrine
of
the
allgeyer
case
as
developed
in
that
case
and
developed
by
the
st.
louis
case
and
by
the
philippine
case,
should
it
be
overruled?
we
say,
yes,
if
it
has
not
already
in
effect
then
overruled
by
this
court.
we
point
out
to
the
fact
that
in
the
20
years
since
the
osborn
case
was
decided,
not
a
single
instance
has
occurred
in
which
this
court
has
applied
the
doctrine
of
the
osborn
case,
the
--
the
allgeyer
case
or
the
st.
louis
case
or
the
other
authorities
based
upon
allgeyer.
in
fact,
each
and
every
time
that
it
has
had
an
opportunity
to
apply
that
doctrine
are
those
or
the
doctrine
of
the
cases
following
it,
it
has
--
it
has
ruled
in
favor
of
the
state
regulation
using
either
--
either
construing
the
case
as
being
on
different
facts
or
in
several
instances
not
only
in
the
field
of
labor
relations
but
in
several
other
instances,
it
has
overruled
the
president
based
upon
allgeyer.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
well,
the
allgeyer
decision,
if
i
can
answer
that
question
first.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
that's
correct.
alright,
the
allgeyer
decision
said
that
the
state
could
not
prevent
an
individual
within
that
state
from
insuring
--
insuring
his
property
or
--
or
entering
into
a
contract
where
the
risk
was
outside
of
the
state.
that
was
a
situation
in
that
--
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
yes,
sir.
that's
--
that's
the
distinction
that
i
was
--
was
making
in
that
particular
situation.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
that's
right.
i
think
that's
--
that's
the
way
i
understand
the
case.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
now,
the
doctrine
has
developed
in
the
st.
louis
and
--
and
philippines
case.
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
--
a
state
can
neither
interfere
with
nor
burden
an
insurance
transaction
if
the
formalities
of
the
contract
or
if
the
contract
is
performed
out
to
be
--
performed
outside
of
the
state.
now,
that's
the
extension
that
i
believe
to
have
been
made
by
those
two
latter
cases
in
which
has
become,
in
my
mind
at
least,
the
allgeyer
doctrine
that
is
that
you
cannot
burden
this
transaction
that
has
--
where
the
formalities
of
the
contract
have
occurred
outside
of
the
state
irrespective
of
the
interest
that
the
state
might
otherwise
have
in
that
insurance
transaction.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
well,
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that
statement
mr.
justice
because
i
believe
the
focus
in
those
early
cases
of
--
was
what
on
what
occurred
outside
of
the
state
and
--
and
not
upon
the
interest
within
the
state.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
well,
i
--
i'm
not
so
sure
that
i
would
agree
that
it's
what
takes
place
within
the
state.
i
--
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
if
that's
to
be
related
to
the
formalities
by
which
the
contract
is
executed,
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
--
at
the
--
for
--
for
example
if
the
fact
that
the
state
has
interest
in
the
property
within
the
state
is
--
is
--
is
nothing
that
takes
place
within
the
state,
it's
something
that
its
there.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
yes,
sir.
that's
--
that's
the
way
i
understand
the
--
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
maybe
not
that
it
can
do
anything
in
relation
to
that
property
but
i
think
--
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
--
that
it
can
enforce
for
example,
its
policies
on
arson
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
it's
--
it's
in
the
insurable
interest
con
--
provisions
of
a
contract
relate
to
the
policy
of
arson.
i
think
it
can
enforce
that
policy
on
it.
and
many
--
many
other
policies
irrespective
of
where
the
contract
is
--
is
executed
to
where
the
individual
resides.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
well
--
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
perhaps
that
was
a
bit
narrow
and
perhaps
i
should
have
stated
it
as
the
place
of
making
or
the
place
of
performance
of
the
contract
where
the
phenomena
with
which
the
allgeyer
line
of
decision
were
most
concerned.
i
--
i
believe
that
would
be
a
--
a
--
a
more
accurate
description
of
the
case.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
that
it
is
realty
situated
within
the
state
of
texas
and
that
we
have
the
respondent
within
the
state
of
texas.
yes,
sir.
and
it
--
it
is
the
interest
that
the
state
has
arriving
from
those
two
matters
that
gives
us
the
--
the
--
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
that's
--
that's
the
taxable
--
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
--
criteria.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
that's
the
effect
of
--
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
--
that's
the
effect
--
that's
the
effect
of
the
tax.
if
i
might,
i
should
like
to
--
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
well
now,
we
--
we
are
not
--
we're
not
limiting
ourselves
simply
to
the
regulatory
effect.
we
say
that
todd
is
also
required
to
play
--
to
pay
its
share
of
the
burden
of
regulation
in
this
particular
field.
and
that,
certainly,
a
fire
on
its
property
has
a
vital
effect
to
texas
and
texas
has
lots
of
regulations
that
pertain
to
that
type
of
a
catastrophe.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
quite
a
bit
of
it.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
quite
a
bit.
in
west
texas
in
particular.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
i
think
--
i
think
that's
incorrect,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
the
way
--
but
prior
--
for
prior
to
the
time
that
2138
was
originally
passed,
there
was
no
tax
at
all
paid
either
by
an
insurance
company
or
by
the
insurer
or
by
the
agent
when
the
insurance
was
placed
with
an
unregulated
carrier.
there
were
taxes
which
were
the
ultimate
burden
of
the
individuals
insuring
with
regulated
carriers.
now,
we've
had
some
conflict
as
to
the
amount
of
that
--
of
that
insurance.
counsel
for
the
respondents
suggests
that
it
was
a
maximum
of
3.85%
but
that's
not
the
case.
the
maximum
tax
when
you
take
into
consideration
the
maintenance
taxes
that
are
involved
will
move
from
something
above
4%
or
something
over
5%
depending
upon
the
type
of
--
of
insurance
that
is
available
or
that
is
written
upon.
now,
of
course,
there
were
the
additional
burdens
and
cost
which
--
which
ultimately
passed
on
to
the
insured
and
--
in
regulated
type
of
insurance.
so
the
first
step
that
the
legislature
took
in
this
field
was
to
pass
2138
providing
that
this
type
of
insurance,
unregulated
insurance
could
be
written
through
licensed
agents
in
the
state
of
texas
and
partially
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
this
particular
regulation
and
i
must
admit
partially
for
the
economic
sanction
that's
involved,
place
the
tax
of
5%
on
those
types
of
transactions
which
the
agent
was
required
to
collect.
now,
this
left
a
tremendous
loophole
and
had
an
--
very
adverse
effect
upon
texas
regulation.
the
--
the
obvious
intent
of
the
legislation
to
begin
with
--
with
was
to
encourage
resort
to
these
agents
in
the
--
in
the
sale
of
--
of
unregulated
insurance
if
it
was
to
be
sold.
but
now
that
there
was
a
premium
tax
placed
upon
that
particular
type
of
transaction
and
non-placed
where
the
individual
himself
placed
the
insurer,
where
quite
naturally,
the
individual
tended
to
avoid
use
of
the
agent.
and
it
was
to
stop
up
this
particular
loophole
that
the
tax
was
levied.
and
it
was
also
to
make
these
people
pay
their
fair
share
of
this
regulatory
burden
that
the
2138
was
amended
to
include
the
5%
tax
on
the
exact
situation
that
we
have
here.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
connecticut
general
--
i
think
the
first
thing
that
you
have
to
do
with
connecticut
general
is
compare
it
to
tabaco
or
the
philippine
case
and
see
just
exactly
what
the
court
was
dealing
with
there.
those
two
cases
are
in
the
ex
--
same
exact
posture
that
is
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
philippine
case
in
which
the
tax
was
affirmed.
there
you
had
two
foreign
companies
that
were
doing
business
in
the
philippines.
the
insurance
was
on
the
risk
within
the
--
within
the
philippines.
that
was
the
--
the
case
of
the
--
of
the
london
company
that
was
insuring
the
risk.
the
court
there
held
that
the
tax
was
alright.
the
tax
was
permissible.
alright
in
--
in
the
connecticut
general
case,
what
is
the
situation?
you
had
two
companies
that
were
doing
business
within
california.
the
first
california
company
not
connecticut
general,
was
insuring
the
lives
in
california
and
was
transferring
this
risk
on
to
connecticut
general.
well,
i
think
it
could
be
said
to
some
--
to
some
extent
the
risk
of
insurance
that
connecticut
general
was
in
--
in
california
but
not
to
the
same
degree
as
the
risk
was
within
the
philippines.
i
think
that
what
the
court
was
simply
doing
there
was
saying
well,
the
interest
that
california
has
where
it's
merely
reinsurance
of
these
lives
and
these
people
have
no
right
to
perceive
directly
against
this
insurance.
the
--
the
interest
of
california
is
not
sufficient.
so
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
say
that
in
the
--
in
--
in
that
particular
case,
the
risk
was
less
within
california
than
it
was
say,
for
example,
in
the
compania
case
or
in
the
osborn
case
or
any
of
the
other
decisions
that
follow
it.
that's
the
only
way
that
i
can
--
can
understand
its
distinction
there.
secondly,
it
was
purely
a
revenue
measure.
the
--
no
--
no
effort
was
--
made
to
sustain
it
as
a
regulatory
--
as
having
any
regulatory
effect
as
we
do
in
this
case.
and
i
--
i
think
those
are
the
bases
on
which
it
can
be
distinguished.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
yes,
sir
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
that's
pa
--
part
of
it.
but
it
also
--
it
also
--
it
also
has
the
effect
of
encouraging
those
companies
that
are
now
in
the
state
of
texas
and
who
are
writing
as
regulated
companies
not
to
plea
the
state
of
texas
and
--
and
right
under
circumstances
in
which
the
--
in
which
the
--
they
could
do
so
much
cheaper.
it's
--
it's
an
effort
to
preserve
the
texas
regulatory
system.
it's
not
necessarily
to
coerce
these
people
into
buying
--
first
place,
but
let
me
point
out
this
distinction
from
the
allgeyer
case.
this
is
not
an
effort
to
prevent
the
purchase
of
that
kind
of
insurance.
it's
quite
obvious.
and
it
is
distinguished
from
the
allgeyer
on
that
basis.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
i
think
there
could
have
been
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
was
raised
as
a
--
as
a
reason
for
sustaining
the
tax
in
that
particular
case.
there
was
no
regulatory
effect
or
no
economic
effect
cited
as
--
as
coming
to
california
because
of
the
tax
levied
upon
--
on
these
particular
transactions.
but
i
--
i
say
that
--
that
the
main
distinction
with
that
case
is
that
--
that
it
did
not
appear,
that
the
risk
was
within
california
in
the
same
sense
as
it
was
and
say
the
compania
case
or
in
this
case.
now
--
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
that's
right.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
well,
of
course,
there
are
numerous
--
numerous
advantages
aside
from
the
--
the
disadvantage
of
the
tax
inequality
that
accrued
to
being
regulated
and
operated
with
--
operating
within
the
regulated
framework.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
i
know,
sir.
i
--
i
--
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
your
honor,
it's
--
it
is
a
substantial
problem
in
the
insurance
industry
today.
all
of
the
--
the
various
states
have
--
have
been
dealing
with
this
problem
not
in
the
exact
way
that
texas
has
--
has
done
but
surplus
insurance
legislation
is
that
particular
line
is
called
is
brought
up
in
all
of
the
legislatures.
the
problem
is
that
large
insurers
of
the
nature
of
todd
and
of
--
of
other
nationwide
insurers,
more
and
more
because
they
--
they
have
the
ability
to
--
to
judge
these
things
more
than
the
smaller
individual.
these
people
are
more
and
more
going
to
the
unregulated
market
and
less
and
less
of
--
of
these
--
of
these
risks
are
coming
--
staying
within
the
framework
of
--
of
the
texas
regulation.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
the
primary
insurers
are
two
english
companies.
one
of
them
is
lloyds
and
lloyds
institute,
i
believe.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
none
that
i
--
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
well,
they
would
write
it
--
they
would
write
it
on
--
on
an
unregulated
basis
as
the
--
i
don't
know
when
they
would
flee
the
united
states
but
they
write
it
on
unregulated
basis
as
the
two
companies
involved
in
the
amici
brief
due
today.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
if
the
--
if
the
state
could
say
to
the
property
owners
within
its
state
that
they
had
to
resort
to
particular
types
of
insurance
companies
within
the
state
that
--
if
that
particular
point
is
valid,
that
there's
nothing
unconstitutional
about
a
tax
levied
that
--
that
merely
aims
to
encourage.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
i
believe
i've
used
up
my
time.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
what
sir?
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
yes,
i
--
i
do
have.
mr.
fred
b.
werkenthin
now,
one
point
that
hasn't
been
discussed
except
in
the
briefs
at
--
at
any
length
is
the
burden
that's
a
problem
related
to
the
questions
that
were
just
asked.
the
burdens
on
companies
such
as
the
church
insurance
company
and
the
catholic
insurance
company
that
are
amici
in
this
case,
they
have
said
that
well
they
do
business
on
an
unauthorized
or
unregulated
basis
by
a
virtue
of
being
able
to
do
business
as
unregulated
carriers.
they
are
able
to
--
to
affect
the
substantial
saving
to
the
policy
holders.
and
they
say
that
if
this
type
of
regulation
is
affirmed,
why
this
saving
will
disappear.
that
may
well
be
but
the
same
type
of
argument
was
advanced
in
the
hoopeston
case.
and
the
court
in
reply
to
that
said,
however,
pers
--
persuasive.
such
arguments
might
be
introduced
to
the
state
legislature.
this
presents
no
constitutional
banner
--
barrier
which
prevents
new
york
from
enforcing
these
regulations
if
it
chooses
to
do
so.
now,
certain
reference
has
been
made
to
the
federal
trade
commission
case
versus
travelers
health
association.
now,
actually
that
case
can
have
no
relation
at
all
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
the
only
way
that
reference
to
the
case
is
justified
at
all
by
respondent
is
that
he
wants
to
argue
that
somehow
congress
is
resurrecting
the
doctrine
of
the
allgeyer
decision
or
is
pronouncing
its
decision
that
has
never
been
overruled.
well
of
course,
congress
--
obviously
a
matter
beyond
congre
--
the
congressional
jurisdiction.
all
that
congress
did
was
to
recite
in
--
in
part
of
the
history
to
that
particular
bill
that
they
thought
that
these
particular
cases
were
still
alive.
but
in
any
event,
the
citation
or
the
--
or
the
authority
relied
upon
are
quoted
in
that
case
shows
that
the
congress
--
merely
that
congress
was
unaware
of
the
osborn
decision
and
the
other
decisions
that
followed
it.
in
closing,
i
want
to
--
to
get
back
to
what
we
think
is
the
fundamental
error
of
respondent's
position
in
this
case.
time
and
time
again,
respondent's
counsel
recited
that
states
cannot
regulate
a
transaction
if
the
transaction
occurred
outside
of
the
state.
he
recited
many,
many
cases
to
that
effect.
but
we
believe
that
the
osborn
case
is
the
lead
of
showing
that
that
position
is
no
longer
correct.
the
osborn
case
simple
sets
aside
the
statement
from
the
st.
louis
compress
case
that
you
can't
burden
or
interfere
with
what
the
state
does
--
what
a
company
does
outside
of
the
state.
in
fact,
the
very
first
--
the
very
first
portion
of
the
--
that
opinion,
the
court
very
carefully
stated,
the
question
is
not
whether
what
virginia
has
done
will
restrict
appellant's
freedom
of
action
outside
of
virginia
by
subjecting
the
exercise
of
such
freedom
to
financial
burdens.
the
court
went
on
to
stay
--
say
that
the
right
of
virginia
to
regulate
in
that
particular
instance,
the
right
in
any
instance
is
measured
by
the
interest
that
it
has
in
the
transaction.
it
is
not
correct
to
suggest
as
respondent
has
that
virginia
did
not
touch
transactions
that
occurred
outside
of
the
state.
for
if
anything
is
clear,
it
is
clear
that
the
virginia
regulation
saying
that
you
have
to
go
through
virginia
agents,
that
you
have
to
pay
virginia
agents
a
commission
prepared,
applied
to
all
insurance
transactions
whether
they
were
executed
inside
the
state
of
virginia
or
whether
they
were
executed
in
new
york.
thank
you.
