mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
from
the
admission
of
petitioner's
counsel
that
st.
louis
compress
controls
this
case
and
in
order
for
the
state
to
prevail
in
this
litigation
that
st.
louis
compress
must
be
overruled.
it
is
at
least
quite
clear
that
the
parties
are
met
today
on
an
old
and
familiar
constitutional
battleground
and
that
is
the
boundary
line
which
separates
permissible
from
prohibited
estate
taxation.
this
terrain
in
this
litigation
has
been
examined
by
this
court
in
at
least
five
or
six
different
cases.
the
landmarks
or
the
benchmarks
are
well-established
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
st.louis
compress
case,
the
tafoya
case,
the
connecticut
general
case,
clearly
controls
this
litigation.
but
in
analyzing
the
boundaries
that
have
been
definitively
established
by
this
court,
we
must
apply
those
boundaries
to
this
one
simple
issue.
does
due
process
prohibit
--
does
due
process
prevent
the
state
of
texas
from
levying
a
discriminatory
tax
on
early
admitted
insurance
based
on
only
one
and
only
one
possible
texas
connection
or
texas
nexus
and
that
is
a
texas
risk
or
its
synonym
texas
property.
the
--
in
answering
that
issue,
you
are
forced,
immediately
met
with
--
with
the
question,
should
st.
louis
compress
be
overruled.
now,
the
facts
must
be
a
little
more
minutely
examined
and
were
examined
by
the
petitioner.
the
insurance
contracts
were
negotiated
in
new
york.
they
were
delivered
in
new
york.
they
were
paid
for
in
new
york.
the
premium
for
paid
for
in
new
york.
all
of
the
negotiations,
all
of
the
decisions
is
to
whether
to
insure
or
not
and
where
to
insure
were
made
in
new
york.
now,
that
is
true
because
todd,
the
respondent
is
a
large
enterprise
having
shipyards
and
some
five
or
six
different
states.
they
have
an
insurance
expert
located
in
the
city
of
new
york.
he
covers
all
of
the
--
all
of
these
marine
risks
and
i
used
that
as
a
broad
terminology
which
he
places
all
the
marine
risks,
some
of
them
under
one
policy
for
five
or
six
different
yards,
yards
in
texas,
yards
in
louisiana,
yards
in
new
jersey,
yards
in
new
york
and
yards
in
california
and
yards
in
the
state
--
state
of
washington.
there
isn't
--
there
is
not
and
the
state
admits
in
this
case
that
texas
has
no
connection
that
there
is
no
transaction
or
activity
by
this
new
york
corporation
in
the
state
of
--
of
texas
that
can
be
connected
in
any
way
with
the
insurance
contracts
or
the
premium
payments
or
for
that
matter
the
losses
either.
the
losses
if
it
has
and
when
occurring
are
adjusted
in
new
york
between
new
york's
expert
and
the
brokerage
companies
are
authorized
to
do
business
in
new
york
in
a
one
capacity
or
another
represent
the
london
insurance.
texas
has
absolutely
no
connection
with
either
the
contracts
or
with
the
losses.
now,
the
london
insurers,
the
london
insurers
are
not
doing
business
in
texas,
they
are
not
admitted
to
do
business
in
texas
and
these
facts
are
all
covered
by
stipulation
that
is
crystal
clear.
they
have
no
agent
in
texas.
they
do
not
solicit
or
have
any
contract
with
the
state
of
texas
whatsoever.
all
of
the
insurance,
negotiations
and
solicitation
are
in
new
york.
lloyd
is
not
admitted
to
do
business
in
texas
and
it
is
not
doing
business
in
texas
and
its
tax
is
not
levied
for
the
privilege
or
the
right
to
do
business
in
texas
or
to
obtain
the
privilege
of
doing
a
texas
insurance
business.
the
respondent
is
domiciled
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
it
has
its
principal
office
and
place
of
business
and
where
it
operates
a
shipyard.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
yes
sir,
if
it
--
if
it
complied
with
the
various
statutes.
of
course,
they
have
not.
i
would
not
want
to
speculate
on
why
not
but
they're
not
subject
to
texas
rate
regulations.
they're
not
subject
to
texas
reserve
requirements.
they're
not
subject
to
capital
requirements
and
texas
also
has
some
discriminatory
taxation
that
are
based
on
investments
in
the
state
in
which
they
allow
companies,
preferential
treatment
if
asked
and
when
their
investments
in
the
state
reach
certain
formulistic
level.
and
lloyd's
has
not
subjected
himself
and
he's
not
now
subjected
to
any
state
regulation.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
in
which
they
say
that
they
have
a
similar
statute.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
the
effect
of
their
brief
is
that
this
court
held
that
statutes
are
similar
statute
unconstitutional
in
1897
and
they
never
have
paid
any
attention
to
the
holding
in
the
allgeyer
case
and
that
i
find
it
to
reverse
it
now.
they
have
had
--
they
have
had
that
statute
on
their
book
for
65
years.
they
come
here
and
say
they
know
it's
been
unconstitutional
all
that
time
but
they
like
to
make
it
lawful
now
as
they
could.
the
state's
brief
presides
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
there,
i
do
not
know.
there,
amici
curiae
then
decide.
the
effect
of
it
is
if
they
still
have
such
a
statute
and
if
they
have
--
they
didn't
like
the
allgeyer
case
in
the
beginning
then
they
don't
like
the
allgeyer
case
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
that's
right.
but
in
some
--
but
the
dislikes
i
think
are
not
aimed
that
the
problem
in
this
are
not
aimed
that
the
problems
in
this
case
which
i
will
go
into
in
a
minute.
todd,
the
respondent
operates
to
texas
ship
--
shipyard.
now,
this
is
an
important
point.
todd
does
operate
a
texas
shipyard.
it
does
do
a
--
a
business
in
texas.
now,
these
cases
that
involve
the
--
the
jurisdictional
boundaries
between
the
state's
right
to
tax
and
where
it
may
not
rightfully
tax,
come
up
here
to
this
court
in
two
basic
postures.
and
it's
important
to
make
this
distinction.
the
state
in
this
case
has
personal
jurisdiction
over
todd
shipyards.
todd
shipyards
is
doing
business
in
the
state
at
which
is
clearly
admitted.
they
are
now
trying
to
extend
the
state's
taxing
powers
to
the
state
of
new
york
against
an
admitted
company.
by
reason
of
transact
--
by
reason
of
its
personal
presence
in
the
state,
they're
trying
to
reach
an
extraterritorial
or
another
state
transaction.
now,
the
case
has
come
up
here
in
another
way.
they
come
up
where
the
company
like
lloyds
is
not
in
the
state.
clearly
not
doing
business
in
the
state
and
the
state
seeks
to
reach
that
company
on
the
grounds
of
transactions
within
the
state.
if
suit
were
brought
against
lloyds,
they
would
be
trying
to
reach
lloyds
through
a
texas
transaction.
in
this
case,
they
admit
the
case
reached
lloyds.
they
admit
lloyds
don't
have
a
texas
transaction.
they're
not
trying
to
project
their
power
to
lloyds.
they're
trying
to
take
the
personal
jurisdiction
that
they
have
over
this
foreign
corporation
and
project
it
to
an
extraterritorial
transaction.
and
--
and
those
are
two
different
postures
in
which
the
case
has
come
up
here
and
sometimes,
the
rules
are
not
altogether
harmonious
unless
that
distinction
is
made
between
projecting
from
personal
jurisdiction
to
an
out
of
state
transaction
and
trying
to
get
the
jurisdiction
to
a
transaction
in
the
state.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
if
lloyd
was
doing
business
in
the
state,
they
would
be
subject
to
the
states
admitted
insurance
tax
on
business
done
in
the
state,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
the
insurer
--
you
mean
the
insured?
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
they
could
if
it
was
a
texas
transaction,
if
it
were
--
if
the
transaction
is
within
texas.
if
they
were
taxing
a
transaction
in
a
taxable
within
texas,
you're
thinking
of
the
scripto
on
similar
cases.
now,
this
transact
--
the
scripto
case
is
--
is
in
the
second
posture.
the
florida
was
reaching
scripto
by
reason
of
scripto's
activities
in
the
state.scripto
was
unfair
and
they
were
reaching
out
to
get
him
by
reason
of
transactions.
it's
also
patently
clear
in
this
case
that
when
the
state
admits
that
they
can't
reach
lloyds,
they
--
they
virtually
admit
texas
has
no
jurisdiction
of
this
transaction.
if
tex
--
if
this
was
a
texas
insurance
contract,
if
texas
has
this
vital
interest
that
the
state
suggest
then
lloyd
would
be
amenable
to
texas
regulation
and
they
could
reach
out
under
the
scripto
in
similar
cases
and
reach
lloyds.
they
take
an
inconsistent
position
when
they
say
they
--
when
they
admit
they
cannot
reach
lloyds
and
when
they
say
but
at
the
same
time,
we
can
tax
what
you
do
with
lloyd
in
new
york.
if
these
were
a
texas
transaction,
if
texas
had
this
jurisdictional
nexus,
if
they
have
the
jurisdictional
connection,
they
could
bring
lloyds
under
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
state
of
texas.
the
position
of
the
state
on
their
point
is
really
inconsistent.
now,
i
would
like
now
to
discuss
if
i
may
in
the
factual
analysis
the
nature
of
the
insurance
and
this
point
is
vital.
this
tax
is
laid
and
this
tax
is
levied
without
regard
to
whether
this
insurance
is
available
and
texas
is
not.
some
of
this
insurance,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
this
factual
point
but
some
of
this
insurance
is
not
available
in
texas
and
cannot
be
purchased
in
texas
because
no
admitted
company
was
right.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
true.
they're
willing
to
take
risk
and
nobody
else
will
tell
you.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
proceed,
sir.
in
connection,
readdressing
ourselves
to
the
nature
of
the
insurance
policies,
the
tax
is
levied
without
regard
to
whether
the
policies
are
available
in
texas
or
not,
and
the
fact
that
the
tex
--
the
taxes
rendered
without
regard
to
availability,
renders
absolutely
sterile
as
state's
arguments
that
it's
for
regulation.
to
the
extent
that
the
insurance
is
unavailable
in
texas,
any
discouragement
of
course
is
--
is
without
any
force
at
all.
certainly,
the
respondent
is
better
off
with
insurance
in
an
unadmitted
insurer
than
none.
it
is
better
off
with
insurance
in
a
corporation
unadmitted
in
texas
than
it
would
be
with
no
insurance.
they
can't
regulate
what
they
don't
offer.
if
the
insurance
is
not
offered
in
texas,
texas
couldn't
be
regulating
it
or
trying
to
force
it
into
a
regulated
market.
the
regulation
argument
is
absolutely
dependent
upon
texas
availability.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
as
to
the
actual
facts,
there
is
no
record
as
to
availability
in
the
market.
the
statute
makes
it
quite
clear
that
they
reach
available
and
unavailable
insurance.
there's
one
section
in
this
same
statute
which
says
that
before
a
licensed
agent
can
obtain
or
purchase
unadmitted
insurance,
he
must
make
an
affidavit
that
admitted
insurance
is
not
available.
so
the
statute
clearly
contemplates
to
tax
it
whether
it's
available
or
not.
it
was
not
thought
material
in
the
trial
court
under
st.
louis
compress,
tabacos,
connecticut
general
and
allgeyer
to
offer
that
proof
and
there
was
none
offered.
now,
the
--
the
state
in
picturing
the
type
of
coverage
here
has
not
accurately
presented
the
coverage
picture.
this
insurance
coverage
and
all
of
the
policies
at
least
by
types
are
printed
in
the
record.
this
coverage
does
cover
comprehensive
coverage
on
certain
personal
property,
principally
dry
docks
and
certain
perhaps
real
property,
principally
palings
and
wards.
but
the
state
argues
this
case
as
though
the
only
insurance
in
the
case
was
a
property
insurance
but
that
is
not
quite
true.
the
insurance
also
covers
liability
for
negligence,
collision
liability
and
products
liability
risks
which
are
not
property
in
texas
but
risks
in
connection
with
texas
work.
for
example
on
the
products
liability
coverage,
if
todd
repaired
a
tanker
say
for
one
of
the
major
international
oil
companies
and
it
had
a
liability
under
the
products
coverage,
the
liability
could
arise
in
hong
kong,
shanghai
or
any
port
of
call
in
the
world.
and
certainly
on
that
insurance,
the
likelihood
of
loss
in
texas
does
not
even
exist.
this
--
this
case
does
not
involve
only
texas
property.
it
involves
products
liability
risk,
it
involves
risk
for
negligence
or
willful
damage
by
vessels
that
are
on
the
dry
docks,
it
also
involves
protection
against
a
collision
hazard
from
the
dry
dock.
the
policies
also
cover
insurance
in
five
or
six
different
states.
now,
the
stipulation
also
includes
this
critical
crucial
fact
and
that
is
that
the
respondent
has
paid
all
taxes.
the
respondent
has
paid
all
taxes
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
texas.
the
state
admits
in
the
stipulation
that
this
tax
cannot
be
justified
as
the
tax
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
texas.
and
now
we
come
to
the
taxes,
what
--
what
is
the
only
factual
connection
with
texas
that
texas
insist
extends
its
taxing
on
to
a
new
york
contract
and
that
is
the
texas
risk.
the
texas
risk
consists
of
the
personal
property,
the
real
estate,
the
product
work
that
was
done
in
texas
and
might
go
anywhere
and
collision
risk
and
negligence
risk
on
the
dry
docks
to
other
people's
property.
in
a
nutshell,
the
only
texas
--
the
only
texas
nexus
--
the
only
texas
connection
if
you
please
is
the
texas
risk.
now,
what
does
the
statute
provide?
those
we
think
are
the
controlling
facts.
what
is
the
nature
of
this
--
of
this
statute?
what
does
the
statute
provide?
this
--
this
is
a
tax
on
a
premium
payment.
the
tax
is
not
due
unless
there
is
a
premium
payment.
a
payment
is
a
condition
preceded
to
the
tax.
therefore,
we
think
that
the
taxable
event,
the
operating
incidence
of
the
tax
clearly
falls
on
the
premium
payment.
if
there
is
a
critic
sale,
if
there
is
a
critic
purchase
of
insurance
and
the
--
the
premium
is
never
paid,
there
is
no
tax.
the
premium
payment
is
a
cynically
none
of
the
type.
and
we
therefore
feel
that
the
premium
payment
is
a
taxable
event,
the
taxable
event
under
the
stipulation
and
as
a
fact,
occurs
and
occurs
only
in
the
city
of
new
york
in
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
the
--
the
statute
levies
the
tax
whether
or
not
there
is
a
local
transaction
or
not.
the
statute
is
not
dependent
upon
any
local
transaction.
a
congolese
could
purchase
that
--
the
insurance
in
the
congo
on
a
texas
risk
and
the
texas
tax
would've
--
would
purport
to
cover
it.
he
of
course,
might
have
some
jurisdictional
problems
in
collecting
it.
but
the
tax
is
in
no
way
limited
to
residence,
it's
not
limited
to
people
doing
business
in
the
state,
it
is
limited
to
--
it
is
defined
only
--
delimited
only
by
a
person
purchasing
insurance
anywhere
from
any
unadmitted
insurer
on
a
texas
risk.
the
only
two
taxable
events
--
not
events
but
the
two
prerequisites
are
the
purchase
from
an
unadmitted
insurer
and
the
purchase
on
a
texas
risk.
the
taxes
are
levied
on
persons,
on
individual
persons,
as
well
as
it
is
lev
--
as
on
corporations.
it
is
levied
on
partnerships,
it
is
levied
on
associations.
there
is
nothing
that
the
statute
is
indiscriminant.
it
le
--
levies
it
on
every
purchaser.
this
fact
also
negatives
any
possible
argument
that
this
tax
was
levied
for
the
corporate
privilege
of
doing
business
in
the
state
because
it's
levied
on
individuals
and
because
it's
levied
without
regard
to
whether
you're
a
corporation
or
admitted
or
not.
the
only
two
requirements
are
the
--
are
the
purchase
from
an
unadmitted
insurer
on
the
texas
property.
now,
we
come
to
the
discriminatory
nature
of
the
tax.
is
the
tax
discriminatory?
now
the
state
or
the
petitioner
has
blown
both
hot
and
cold
in
its
brief.
the
petitioner
in
one
position
has
argued
that
the
tax
is
discriminatory
that
it
is
purposely
discriminatory
in
order
to
accomplish
what
the
state
or
the
petitioner
describes
as
a
re
--
as
a
regulatory
effect.
in
other
words,
by
the
higher
tax,
they
accomplish
regulation
by
discouraging
the
purchase.
in
another
place
in
its
brief,
the
state
argues
that
this
tax
is
to
equalize
the
tax
burden.
if
it
is
to
merely
equalize
the
tax
burden,
then
of
course
the
state
loses
its
regulatory
effect.
the
truth
of
course
is
that
while
the
state
has
taken
both
positions
in
its
brief
that
it
--
to
equalize
taxes
and
put
them
on
an
equal
basis
and
in
another
--
in
another
place
in
its
brief,
it
is
discriminatory
to
discourage
the
--
to
discourage
the
purpose,
the
truth
is
that
it
is
discriminatory.
the
rate
on
unadmitted
purchases
from
unadmitted
insurers
is
at
the
rate
of
5%
of
the
premium
pay,
5%
of
the
premium
paid
while
the
taxes
to
unad
--
to
admitted
insurers,
domesticated
insurers
if
you
pleasem,
varies
from
a
minimum
rate
of
1.1%.
that's
a
difference
of
over
400%
and
almost
500%
to
a
maximum
rate.
the
maximum
rate
on
any
admitted
insurer
is
3.85%.
the
graduated
scale
or
the
scale
from
1.1%
to
3.85%
is
determined
--
is
determined
by
a
formula
in
the
statute
that
varies
dependent
upon
the
admitted
insurers'
investment
in
texas
property.
the
tax,
not
only
is
discriminatory
in
that
regard,
admitted
insurers
are
granted
in
the
same
statue,
a
sweeping
tax
immunity
from
any
tax
immunity
from
any
tax
agent
by
any
other
political
subdivision
of
the
state.
the
respondent
is
granted
no
such
broad
tax
immunity.
in
other
words,
the
admitted
insurers
in
return
for
the
premium
tax
on
their
premiums
are
admitted,
are
given
immunity
from
insurance
occupation
taxes
on
--
from
other
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
which
is
a
privilege
the
respondent
does
not
enjoy.
the
taxes
for
the
discriminatory
in
that,
domestic
insurers,
if
a
policy
is
cancelled
and
a
--
and
a
return
premium
is
paid
are
permitted
to
credit
a
return
premium
against
the
tax
whereas
an
unadmitted
insurer
is
not
given
the
same
credit.
so,
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
tax
is
patent
--
that
the
tax
is
patently
discriminatory.
now,
as
we
move
into
the
legal
issues
involved
in
this
case,
there
are
four
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
i
say
it
is
discrimina
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
mr.
just
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
tabacos
case?
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
what
judge
holmes
has
said
there
on
the
grounds
that
the
compress
opinion
was
based
on
discrimination.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
a
penalty
into
a
--
in
the
nature
of
a
discriminatory
tax.
yes,
sir.
the
penalty
was
in
the
nature
in
st.
louis
compress
of
a
discriminatory
tax.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
a
penalty
in
the
sense
that
it
is
discriminatory.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
in
that
you
pay
more
than
you
--
if
you
bought
from
an
admitted
insurer.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
he
--
he
pays
at
the
rate
of
1.1%
up
to
3.85%
as
against
5%.
that's
the
same
thing
that
you
had
in
the
st.
louis
compress
case.
the
majority
in
the
philippines
case
into
which
your
honor
refers
held
that
the
discriminatase
--
the
discrimination
was
immaterial.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
are
you
referring
to
the
labor
cases?
the
--
the
st.
louis
compress
case
has
never
really
been
criticized.
your
honor
wrote
an
opinion
in
the
hoopeston
case
in
which
you
said
that
the
allgeyer
case
has
been
occasionally
doubted
and
in
that
--
and
--
and
in
making
that
statement
that
it
had
been
occasionally
doubted.
your
honor
had
reference
i'm
sure
to
the
labor
case.
and
i'd
be
glad
to
discuss
the
allgeyer
decision
with
you
for
a
moment.
the
all
--
in
the
allgeyer
decision,
louisiana
levied
a
tax
on
unadmitted
insurers.
but
the
--
in
the
allgeyer
case,
the
tax
was
levied
only,
only
and
only
if
there
was
an
act
in
the
state
of
louisiana
leading
to
the
insurance
if
there
was
an
act
in
the
state
of
--
of
louisiana.
nevertheless,
in
the
allgeyer
case,
they
held
that
tax
unconstitutional
even
though
there
was
a
step
in
the
contract,
even
though
there
was
a
formulation
of
the
contract
inside
the
state
of
louisiana.
now,
the
--
the
reason
that
your
honor
was
able
to
say
in
the
hoopeston
case
that
allgeyer
had
been
doubted
was
because
in
the
yellow-dog
labor
contract
cases
and
in
the
right
to
work
cases,
the
court
had
said
and
said
through
you
a
time
or
two
that
a
--
that
in
the
allgeyer
case,
there
was
--
that
that
in
fact
was
a
louisiana
contract.
that
in
effect,
one
of
the
essential
steps
in
allgeyer
was
a
louisiana
contract
and
allgeyer
really
involved
the
regulation
of
a
louisiana
contract.
now,
that's
where
the
doubt
has
come
about
as
to
whether
or
not
allgeyer
regulated
a
louisiana
contract
or
not.
if
that
was
a
new
york
contract,
the
argument
with
allgeyer
is
not
about
whether
you
can
tax
a
new
york
contract
or
not.
the
argument
in
allgeyer
is
whether
it
was
really
a
new
york
contract
or
whether
it
was
a
louisiana
contract.
this
court
has
never
questioned
the
proposition
that
if
a
transaction
is
wholly
made
in
the
state
of
new
york,
then
another
state
cannot
--
cannot
tax
it,
cannot
tax
that
transaction.
now,
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
say
that
the
allge
--
that
--
that
is
a
--
that
is
the
basic
allgeyer
principle
and
it
has
never
been
doubted.
it
has
never
been
questioned.
the
thing
that
has
been
questioned
is
whether
or
not
the
mailing
of
the
notice
of
the
cotton
to
be
insured,
a
necessary
step
in
the
formulation
of
the
contract
in
louisiana
was
not
a
louisiana
contract
and
if
the
court
didn't
go
haywire
in
holding
at
a
new
york
contract
tax
by
louisiana
rather
than
a
louisiana
contract.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
to
regulate
the
types?
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
so
--
so
long
as
it
was
business
done
in
the
state
or
by
admitted
insurers,
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
say
that
if
lloyd's
of
london
issues
a
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
claxton
case.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
there
--
there
--
there
are
some
cases
involving
whether
they
had
insurable
interest
or
not?
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
--
in
those
cases
went
off
on
one
point
and
that
was
that
if
you
tried
that
case
in
a
texas
forum
and
that
it
was
a
texas
public
policy
not
to
enforce
them,
applying
conflicts
laws
not
constitutional
law
that
texas
could
apply
its
conflict
law
in
its
forums
without
violating
the
constitution
but
that's
a
four
or
five
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
yes,
but
--
but
--
but
that
case
holds
this
and
nothing
more
that
texas
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
it's
--
its
one
--
it's
one
of
the
more
but
--
but
here,
you
have
--
you
have
a
lawsuit
in
the
texas
court
and
texas
--
the
texas
rules
of
civil
procedures
certainly
could
apply
to
a
texas
court.
and
the
texas
conflict
--
texas
conflict
rules
could
apply
to
a
trial
in
that
forum.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
and
that
--
all
that
case
held
that
they
could
regulate
the
rules
of
law
to
applying
a
texas
forum.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
this
came
from
texas
but
we're
not
dealing
with
a
complex
rule
of
procedure
or
of
evidence.
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
tax
on
new
york
contract.
you
also
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
now,
you
also
have
a
new
york
life
insurance
case
versus
head
which
is
near
to
this
case
than
that
one.
and
new
york
life
insurance
versus
head
said
that
that
where
a
contract
was
laid
out
--
insurance
contract
laid
outside
of
texas,
texas
can
change
it.
i
--
i
will
say
in
all
candid
that
in
cases
which
have
involved
questions
of
--
of
procedure
in
the
forums
of
the
state
that
this
--
this
court
has
given
them
more
latitude.
that's
your
watson
case,
your
direct
action
statutes
that
this
--
that
they
have
a
right
to
prescribe
the
rules
of
procedure
and
the
rules
of
law
to
be
applied
in
those
courts.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
that's
probably
one
thing
but
to
say
that
they
can
tax
a
contract
in
another
state
is
quite
another
thing.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
on
texas
real
estate?
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
yes,
i
would
think
they
probably
could.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
these
courts
ever
passed
on
those
two
propositions.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
i'm
an
advocate
and
not
a
prophet.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
yes,
yes.
you
know,
i
--
i
have
--
i
have
to
go
by
what
the
law
is
and
know
what
it
will
be.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
and
the
law
in
this
case
is
already
permanently
declared
in
at
least
five
or
six
cases.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
the
--
there
are
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
they
do
have
a
driver's
responsibility
law.
i
really
haven't
briefed
that.
and
i
don't
like
to
fly
by
the
sea
to
my
pants
with
these
hypothetical
questions.
i
mean
it's
a
very
dangerous
thing
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
what
i
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
and
i
would
--
i
would
--
if
i
knew
where
you
were
going.
i'm
a
little
fearful
of
the
socratic
method
of
--
and
not
without
reason.
be
that
--
be
that
--
be
that
as
it
may
in
getting
back
to
the
question
at
hand,
we
think
that
there
are
four
pivotal
distinctions
that
must
be
made
in
deciding
the
validity
of
this
type
of
tax.
and
--
and
the
first
of
those
is
whether
or
not
the
tax
can
be
justified
as
a
tax
on
the
doing
of
business
in
the
state
that
is
whether
the
tax
can
be
justified
as
on
the
granted
privilege
and
that's
our
distinction
of
mr.
justice
black
that
was
made
in
the
philippine
case,
the
distinction
between
this
kind
of
a
tax
on
unadmitted
insurer
and
this
kind
of
a
tax
on
unadmitt
--
on
an
admitted
insurer.
that
distinction
can
be
--
that
distinction
can
be
critical.
the
next
is
whether
the
tax
can
be
justified
as
tax
--
as
a
tax
done
on
business
within
the
state
or
whether
it
is
bu
--
on
a
type
of
tax
on
business
done
without
the
state
and
in
the
next
question
--
the
next
distinction
whether
it's
a
tax
on
a
transaction
within
on
a
transaction
without
the
state
and
whether
or
not
it's
a
tax
on
a
texas
contract
or
a
tax
on
a
new
york
contract.
now,
the
state
has
already
admitted
that
st.
louis
compress
is
indistinguishable
and
this
court
must
first
meet
or
face
the
problem
of
whether
it
should
be
overruled
or
not.
the
tabacos
case
or
the
philippines
case
--
the
philippines
case
reaffirmed
the
st.
louis
compress
case
under
the
sale
--
same
attacks
that
are
made
by
the
state
here
in
an
opinion,
i
think,
of
our
chief
justice
taft
that
--
that
the
philippines
case
draws
a
very
narrow
boundary.
it
draws
a
very
narrow
boundary
and
said
the
same
tax
applied
to
an
admitted
company
is
good
or
as
if
applied
to
an
admi
--
unadmitted
company
it
is
bad.
now,
that's
a
narrow
boundary.
i
would
be
the
first
to
say
that
it
is
a
narrow
boundary.
but
i
would
also
be
quick
to
say
that
we're
on
the
right
side
of
a
very
narrow
boundary.
and
if
i'm
not
play
dry
from
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
a
boundary
is
nonetheless
the
worst
for
being
narrow
if
you're
on
the
right
side
of
it
at
any
rate.
the
next
case
we
rely
on
is
the
connecticut
general
case
which
was
decided
in
this
court
and
i
believe,
the
year
1938
at
least
in
that
era.
in
the
connecticut
general,
the
state
of
california
before
they
can
levy
a
tax,
connecticut
general
purported
to
levy
a
tax
upon
--
california
purported
to
levy
the
tax
on
connecticut
general
on
reinsurance
contracts
made
in
the
state
of
connecticut
based
on
the
premiums
or
measured
on
the
premiums
paid
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
this
court
held
with
one
dissent
by
mr.
justice
black
that
the
connecticut
contracts
and
the
connecticut
premium
payments
were
not
amenable
and
not
within
the
taxes
--
taxing
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
california.
now,
the
--
the
petitioners
in
the
course
of
this
long
litigation
involved
some
10
or
12
briefs
and
they
have
never
met
the
connecticut
general
case
at
any
way.
they
have
never
answered
to
connecticut
general
case.
they
have
never
tried
to
meet
it.
in
fact,
this
case
is
stronger
than
connecticut
general.
connecticut
general
says
if
you
have
a
contract
in
connecticut
and
a
premium
payment
in
connecticut
and
that's
in
303
u.s.
that
if
you
have
a
connecticut
contract,
if
you
have
a
connecticut
premium
payment
even
though
the
--
the
insurance
policies
are
on
the
lives
of
california
residents,
the
state
of
connecticut
--
the
state
of
california
has
no
jurisdiction
to
tax
and
they
have
transgressed
a
well-established
constitutional
boundary
and
the
tax
must
fall.
that
distinction
runs
throughout
the
cases.
if
the
transaction
is
a
connecticut
transaction,
california
can't
tax
it.
if
it's
a
new
york
transaction
as
in
this
case,
the
state
of
texas
can't
tax
it
based
on
property
or
lives
within
the
state.
now,
the
dissent
in
that
case
was
based
--
we
are
stronger
than
--
and
connecticut
general
has
pointed
out
in
the
dissent
because
connecticut
general
had
a
permit
in
the
taxing
state
and
was
doing
business
in
the
taxing
state
and
the
state
of
california
tried
to
justify
as
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
doing
business.
now,
although
--
although
i
primarily
rely
is
on
st.
louis
compress
and
--
and
connecticut
general
and
on
what
i
call
the
philippine
or
tabacos
case
and
although
we're
much
near
connecticut
general
than
we're
on
allgeyer,
the
state
levies
it
the
entire
force
of
its
arguments
in
allgeyer.
in
other
words,
the
state
has
lost
its
own
clay
pigeon
to
shoot
down.
we
--
the
allgeyer
case
could
be
overruled.
the
allgeyer
case
could
be
overruled
on
the
basis
that
it
was
a
louisiana
and
not
a
new
york
contract
without
affecting
this
case
one
or
the
other.
we
are
in
a
much
stronger
position
in
the
allgeyer
case,
very
much
stronger
position.
the
--
and
that
you
could
over
--
if
a
proper
case
came
out,
you
can
overrule
allgeyer
and
still
affirm
or
reaffirm
st.
louis
compress.
now,
that
is
mildly
a
financial
provisions,
judge
holmes
pointed
that
out
himself
in
the
st.louis
compress
opinion
in
which
he
said,
the
st.
louis
compress
is
a
stronger
case
than
allgeyer
for
this
very
reason
that
in
allgeyer,
you
had
a
step
or
part
of
the
contract
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
now,
i
--
i
should
like
if
i
might
to
then
pass
to
the
--
to
the
authorities
relied
on
by
the
state.
the
state
says
at
the
beginning
with
osborn
versus
ozlin
that
a
--
a
brave
new
world
of
constitutional
law
was
opened
up.
that
due
process
underwent
a
metamorphose.
that
due
process
underwent
some
revolutionary
change.
respondent
does
not
believe
that
that
is
a
fact.
osborn
versus
ozlin
--
ozlin
is
in
a
traditional
due
process
group.
there's
nothing
in
osborn
versus
ozlin
that
is
revolutionary
nor
is
there
anything
in
osborn
versus
ozlin
that
affects
this
case.
now,
osborn
versus
ozlin
holds
one
thing
and
only
one
thing
and
that
is
that
--
and
that
is
this
simple
thing
that
the
state
of
virginia
could
regulate
insurance
business
inside
the
state
of
virginia
within
the
state
of
virginia
and
that
as
a
part
of
that
right,
they
could
regulate
the
employment
contract
between
an
insurance
agent
in
virginia
and
a
domesticated
virginia
company.
they
could
regulate
the
business
and
contracts
within.
and
then
we
come
to
what
is
also
--
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
power
to
regulate
without
the
state.
we
make
the
distinction
between
regulating
what
goes
on
within
and
without
the
state.
now,
i
--
i
think
that
there
can
be
nothing
clearer
than
that
osborn
versus
ozlin
is
limited
to
regulating
the
insurance
business
within
the
state
of
virginia.
and
to
remove
all
doubt
about
it
and
to
remove
all
doubt
about
it
and
to
firmly
establish
in
that
opinion
the
difference
between
regulation
within
and
regulation
without
the
state
at
the
close
of
that
opinion,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
that
osborn
is
different
from
the
tafoya
case,
t-a-f-o-y-a,
it's
reported
in
275
u.s.
which
was
an
opinion
by
judge
holmes.
and
it's
follows
in
the
st.
louis
compress
vein
and
consistent
with
it
and
it
was
distinguished
in
osborn
versus
ozlin.
in
the
tafoya
case,
the
state
of
new
mexico
had
undertaken
to
say
that
the
insurance
company
could
pay
no
compensation
to
any
agent
or
any
broker
for
insuring
new
mexico
risk.
they
prohibited
the
payment
of
compensation
to
any
insurance
agent
for
the
procuring
of
an
insurance
policy
on
a
new
mexico
risk.
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
osborn
case
that
that
was
an
attempt
to
regulate
what
the
insurance
company
did
outside
the
state.
what
--
what
--
what
new
mexico
tried
to
do
in
texas
or
oklahoma
was
prohibited.
they
could
not
--
they
could
not
regulate
insurance
agents'
compensation
outside
the
state.
osborn
versus
ozlin
is
merely
the
other
side
of
the
same
coin
and
said
--
which
holds
that
in
tafoya,
the
compensation
was
outside
the
state
and
was
the
same
done
outside
the
state
and
was
invalid.
following
osborn
versus
ozlin,
they
were
--
they
were
regulating
or
they
were
fixing
a
compensation
agreement
for
activity
within
the
state
of
virginia.
osborn
versus
ozlin
is
even
broader
than
that
or
narrower
depending
upon
your
point
of
view.
it
holds
that
the
state
of
virginia
could
establish
an
agency
system
for
doing
the
insurance
business
in
the
state
of
virginia.
and
as
a
part
of
that
system,
they
could
provide
for
the
compensation
--
compensation
of
agents.
it
was
limited
to
insurance
business
in
virginia
and
the
method
of
doing
that
insurance
bu
--
business
in
virginia.
now,
the
hoopeston
case
relied
on
by
the
state
--
the
hoopeston
case
relied
on
by
the
state
is
entirely
wider
the
more
and
not
within
orbital
range
of
this
case.
in
hoopeston,
there
was
a
simple
--
there
was
a
simple
problem.
the
hoopeston
--
the
--
the
hoopeston
insurance
which
was
a
reciprocal
association
of
insurer,
these
insurers
wanted
a
permit
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
new
york.
they
wanted
them
to
seek
permit
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
new
york.
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
insu
--
now
listen
to
this,
the
insurers
and
the
insured
were
both
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
insurers'
contracts
were
in
the
state
of
new
york.
they
solicited
insurance
in
the
state
of
new
york.
they
paid
claims
and
investigated
claims
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
they
will
claim
an
immunity
from
new
york
regulation
based
upon
the
obvious
doing
business.
here,
the
problem
hoopeston
is
the
second
projection.
in
hoopeston,
new
york
was
reaching
out
to
--
to
make
a
company
that
was
doing
business
qualifying
the
state
based
on
new
york
transactions.
and
it
was
--
it
was
clear
that
they
were
doing
business
in
the
state.
and
what
was
clear
in
the
hoopeston
case,
that
the
insurer
was
doing
business
in
the
state
is
admitted
not
to
exist
in
this
case.
the
insurer
is
not
doing
business
under
the
stipulation
in
this
case.
and
the
state
is
very
proud
of
that
fact.
the
hoopeston
case
is
--
is
nothing
more
no
less
than
a
finding
that
hoopeston
--
the
insurer
was
doing
business
in
the
state
and
therefore
subject
to
internal
regulation.
there
was
no
attempt
to
project
the
taxing
power
or
the
regulatory
power
outside
the
state
of
new
york
and
it
is
completely
inappropriate
here.
travelers
health
--
health
association
is
the
same
kind
of
a
doing
business
case.
here,
we're
not
looking
to
see
if
lloyds
is
doing
business
because
it
is
admitted
they
are
not.
the
stated
--
the
state
concedes
they
are
not
doing
business
in
the
state.
now,
the
--
the
state
suggests
that
st.
louis
compress
should
be
overruled
because
it's
stayed
all
authority.
st.
louis
compress,
allgeyer
and
connecticut
general
were
all
cited
by
this
court
as
late
as
march
in
1960.
in
--
in
the
federal
trade
commission
versus
travelers
health
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
holding
nothing
really
on
the
point
in
issue
--
holding
nothing
on
the
point
in
issue
but
recognizing
that
authority
now
--
not
withstand
--
not
with
the
authority
in
support
of
the
respondent's
position
is
clear
and
unequivocal.
now,
we
turn
to
should
it
be
overruled.
dissent
--
and
i
say
that
as
the
toolson
rule
should
be
invoked
in
this
case.
the
toolson
rule
was
a
new
york
yankee
case
where
an
attempt
was
made
to
bring
him
within
--
bring
them
within
the
state,
within
the
scope
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
this
court
said
that
a
long
time
ago
we
let
baseball
develop
believing
that
it
once
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
and
we
therefore
will
not
reexamine
it
because
the
business
has
been
left
for
a
long
time
to
develop
on
that
proposition.
the
insurance
business
here
has
been
left
to
develop
for
65
years
in
reliance
and
based
on
the
allgeyer,
saint
louis
compress,
tabacos,
tafoya,
connecticut
general
cases.
now,
(inaudible)
will
immediately
say
that
toolson
is
statutory
and
you
are
involving
constitutional
principle.
and
i
say
that
is
a
distinction
but
it
is
no
difference.
stability
is
as
much
a
merit
in
the
one
area
as
the
other
and
that
the
toolson
rule
should
be
applied
to
this
case
and
that
st.
louis
compress
and
its
progeny
should
not
be
reexamined
but
that
they
should
be
reaffirmed
because
not
only
has
the
shipyard
business
but
the
insurance
business
has
been
left
to
develop
for
65
years
in
reliance
upon
it.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
there
is
a
big
difference
between
a
congressional
statute
and
a
constitution.
the
only
policy
argument
that
you
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
well,
this
--
this
court
had
now
put
a
position
to
admit
the
case
is
still
going,
making
that
line
entitled
to
preferential
treatment.
that's
true.
the
--
the
real
distinction
that
you
can
make
if
you
want
to
--
is
to
say
that
it's
more
cumbersome
to
change
the
constitution
than
it
is
to
change
the
statute.
and
i
don't
know
if
the
president
will
agree
with
you
or
not
but
it's
--
it
--
it
can
be
difficult
to
do
either
one.
this
is
not
--
this
--
this
is
not
a
--
this
is
--
this
is
not
a
civil
rights
case.
we're
not
dealing
with
--
with
personal
--
personalities.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
rights
of
persons.
here,
we're
dealing
with
property
rights
where
there's
certainly
less
compelling
reason
to
overrule
long
establish
our
constitutional
precedent.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
well,
it
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
--
i'm
not
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
not
been
reluctant
at
times
to
overrule.
but
in
the
toolson
case
for
some
reason,
it
was
reluctant.
and
i'm
saying
that
the
same
factors
of,
again,
toolson
case
are
present
here.
here,
you
have
a
shipyard
that
goes
in,
it
spends
a
lot
of
money,
it
gets
into
the
shipyard
business,
it's
been
since
1934,
it's
carried
these
policies,
this
is
not
something
that
we
did
--
done
to
get
into
this
lawsuit
or
to
attack
the
statute.
we
were
there
for
23
years
before
the
statute
existed.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
i
think
they
are
not
only
old
but
they
are
right.
and
that
has
been
a
long
time
since
they
have
been
questioned
on
this
fact.
that
if
--
the
--
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
there
had
been
many
advocates
and
they've
been
over
aggressively
trying
to
extend
them
beyond
the
scope
that
could
be
taken.
and
you've
distinguished
them
time
and
time
again.
but
when
you
distinguish
a
case,
you
don't
impinge
upon
its
authority.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
there's
a
lot
of
tall
talk
and
--
and
most
of
the
tall
talk
is
--
and
most
of
the
thing
--
the
two
things
that
are
bad
about
allgeyer
and
to
differentiate
it
and
the
thing
that
got
it
in
trouble
was
that
it
was
possible
to
make
a
strong
argument.
there
was
the
louisiana
contract
because
--
because
it
would
--
the
statue
only
reached
louisiana
transaction.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
there's
a
lot
of
general
language
in
allgeyer.
there's
not
in
st.
louis
compress.
st.
louis
compress
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
two
different
hands.
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
the
one
is
pungent
thrust,
quick,
clear
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
--
and
unequivocal,
short
and
unequivocal.
but
nonetheless,
right.
an
opinion
doesn't
have
to
be
long
to
be
right.
i've
--
i
don't
suppose
anybody
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
the
corollary
of
that
is
also
true
of
the
fact
that
it's
long
doesn't
make
it
wrong.
so
--
mr.
charles
r.
vickery,
jr.
here
we
are.
now,
we
would
--
we
--
we
have
used
a
lot
of
words
to
prove
nothing.
but
i
only
--
i
only
have
a
few
minutes
left
and
i
want
to
get
down
to
the
--
to
the
--
to
the
real
meat
of
this
case
and
the
authority
behind
it.
but
the
state
is
asking
you
to
--
what
the
state
is
besieging
these
courts
to
do
is
one
simple
thing,
one
simple
thing.
they
say
that
we
want
you
to
say
that
if
there
is
a
texas
risk,
insurance
on
texas
property
or
insurance
on
a
job
in
texas
are
on
a
texas
risk,
we
want
you
to
take
that
bare
fact,
texas
risk
in
saying
that
that
gives
us
regulatory
dominion
and
that
that
gives
us
taxing
dominion
over
the
transaction.
now,
this
court
has
re
--
has
rejected
as
a
jurisdictional
nexus
the
texas
risk
argument
six
times,
six
times.
the
jurisdictional
nexus
based
on
the
taxes
or
a
local
state
risk
has
been
rejected.
and
it
--
it
was
rejected
for
the
first
time
in
the
allgeyer
case
in
165
u.s.
then
in
st.
louis
compress
in
260,
in
tafoya
in
270,
in
the
philippine
case
in
275,
in
connecticut
general
in
303
u.s.
and
it
was
rejected
again
in
provident
savings
versus
kentucky
in
239
u.s.
103.
but
by
so
far,
65
years
of
constitutional
history
in
six
different
cases
where
the
issue
was
squarely
presented,
this
court
has
seen
that
a
bare
texas
risk
is
an
insufficient
jurisdictional
nexus.
now,
the
next
argument
that
the
state
makes
--
a
basic
argument
is
that
some
economic
catastrophe
may
befall,
the
shipyard
in
which
they
have
a
grave
interest.
this
--
this
economic
interest
depends
upon
several
ifs,
its
two
if-if
on
which
to
base
constitutional
policy,
if
you
have
a
loss,
if
law
had
escape
payment,
if
the
respondent
can't
rebuild
the
shipyard,
then
you
have
this
dire
economic
consequences.
that
is
three
--
that's
three
ifs.
and
that
--
that
argument
is
also
squarely
met
in
the
connecticut
general
case
when
it
was
said
by
the
chief
justice
stone
that
the
jurisdiction
to
tax
does
not
depend,
the
jurisdiction
to
tax
does
not
depend
upon
the
ultimate
thrust
of
the
economic
benefits
and
burdens
of
the
transaction.
i
say
--
i
say
that
you
cannot
base
a
states
jurisdiction
to
tax
upon
possibilities,
upon
visions
of
dire
economic
consequences,
it
may
never
happen.
we've
had
this
insurance
now
for
28
years
and
it's
never
happened.
it's
not
a
long
time
in
geologic
time
but
it's
a
pretty
substantial
for
the
history
in
human
life,
28
years.
i
say
that
--
that
if
this
court
accepts
as
a
jurisdictional
nexus,
the
ultimate
economic
thrust
of
the
benefits
and
burdens
of
possible
acts
of
god
or
war
or
chance
that
that
is
too
thin,
too
thin
a
basis
upon
which
to
base
jurisdiction.
now,
this
tax
cannot
be
justified
as
the
state
suggested
as
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
the
state
because
it's
levied
without
regard
to
whether
you
do
business
or
not
and
for
even
the
stronger
reason
they
have
admitted
that
we've
paid
all
the
taxes.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
sum
up
by
simply
saying
that
st.
louis
compress
was
right
and
should
be
reaffirmed
that
the
texas
court
should
be
affirmed
and
that
this
tax
cannot
be
justified
as
a
tax
on
property.
it
cannot
be
justified
as
a
tax
on
business
done
in
the
state
of
texas
because
it
was
business
done
in
the
state
of
texas.
it
cannot
be
justified
as
a
transaction
within
the
state
of
texas
because
it
was
a
transaction
within
the
state
of
new
york.
it
cannot
be
justified
as
a
tax
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
the
state.
and
the
state
--
even
if
the
state
of
texas
has
the
temerity
to
suggest
that
it
maybe
ought
to
be
sustained
because
the
state
of
texas
gave
to
the
respondent
the
opportunity
to
insure
which
also
comes
from
judge
holmes
in
which
he
said
that
the
opportunity
to
insure
was
a
great
thing
or
privilege.
but
the
opportunity
to
insure
that
was
given
here
was
given
by
the
state
of
new
york.
if
anybody's
going
to
make
that
argument
here,
it
ought
to
be
the
state
of
new
york.
texas
then
gave
the
respondent
the
opportunity
to
insure
the
--
the
state
of
--
of
new
york
didn't.
texas
cannot
--
cannot
claim
the
right
to
tax
the
respondent
for
a
privilege
not
granted.
that
is
the
privilege
to
make
a
contract
in
new
york,
the
privilege
to
insure
in
new
york
and
the
privilege
to
negotiate
and
do
business
in
new
york.
texas
is
claiming
the
right
to
tax
a
privilege
granted
not
by
it
but
granted
by
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
it
is
also
possible
that
st.
louis
compress
has
overruled
that
new
york
certainly
has
jurisdiction
to
this
contract.
new
york
certainly
has
jurisdiction.
it
was
made
in
the
state
of
new
york.
where
do
we
like,
if
we
use
the
socratic
--
the
socratic
method
and
become
prophetic
for
a
minute,
where
do
we
like,
if
you
permit
the
state
of
texas
and
the
state
of
new
york
to
both
have
jurisdiction
of
this
policy
and
they've
--
and
they
have
conflicting
policy
provisions
which
is
not
improbable.
the
new
york
life
insurance
company
versus
head
brought
up
that
problem
years
ago.
if
new
york
has
got
that
--
if
transaction
was
in
new
york,
the
agreement
is
in
new
york,
the
business
was
done
in
new
york
and
they
certainly
have
jurisdiction.
what
if
their
reserved
requirements,
their
capital
requirements,
their
policy
requirements
get
in
direct
conflict
with
texas?
that
has
to
be
resolved
and
can
only
be
resolved
by
this
court.
we
are
not
seeking
to
escape
all
insurance
taxation
or
regulatory
taxation.
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
a
--
and
we
do
it
with
the
conviction
of
the
st.
louis
compress
case
is
to
keep
the
texas
taxing
power
in
texas
and
the
new
york
taxing
power
in
new
york
and
we
are
willing
to
submit
and
are
submitting
to
the
--
to
the
new
york
jurisdiction.
it's
mentioned
in
the
policies
that
service
can
be
held
on
the
commissioner
of
insurance
in
new
york.
we
therefore
submit
that
the
texas
court
should
be
affirmed
and
this
--
and
the
long
line
of
authority
supporting
our
position
should
not
be
overruled.
thank
you.
