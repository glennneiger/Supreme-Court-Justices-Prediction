justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
respondent
here
paid
the
tax,
large
--
that
have
gone
into
texas,
in
fact
the
charge
content
with
todd.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
this
--
if
todd
had
paid
the
tax.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
yes,
i
know
but
assuming
that
todd
--
assuming
that
you
prevail
in
this
lawsuit
as
far
as
texas
is
concerned,
lloyd
can
write
insurance
in
there
with
anybody
who
was
going
to
pay
5%
tax.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand,
yes
but
as
far
as
that's
given
compliance
in
--
in
those
respects,
lloyd's
can
go
ahead
and
write
to
its
heart's
content.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
--
what
my
question
is
how
does
this
regulate
law
that's
why
i
can't
understand?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they're
making
it
tougher
to
the
out
of
state
company
to
come
in.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
do
with
the
st.
louis
cotton
case
as
mr.
justice
holmes
write
on
them,
is
that
identical
with
your
situation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
would
have
to
overrule
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
i
would
suppose
that's
the
case,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
lloyds
is
in
texas,
could
they
impose
this
tax
on
lloyd?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
how
could
the
state
since
they
can't
get
lloyd
in
their
hands
on
lloyds,
can
they
make
the
--
can
they
make
the
insurer
a
collection
agent
form?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
insured,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
true,
a
lot
of
lloyd's
policy
that's
why
they're
so
successful.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
--
is
what
you're
arguing
now,
does
that
have
a
basis
in
the
record?
i
thought
you
said,
it
was
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
a
big
difference
though
is
there
between
toolson
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
are
you
going
to
suggest
another
difference?
toos
--
toolson
is
baseball.
