mr.
bob
e.
shannon
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
grants
certiorari
to
the
third
court
of
civil
appeals
in
texas
back
in
october
of
1961.
that
court
of
civil
appeals
had
held
a
provision
of
the
texas
insurance
code
invalid
as
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
federal
constitution.
that
provision
is
section
2
(e)
of
article
2138
of
the
insurance
code.
this
provision
simply
lays
a
5%
tax
upon
the
premiums
paid
by
a
person
owning
taxes
risks
who
insures
those
taxes
risks
with
unauthorized
insurance
companies.
now,
an
unauthorized
insurance
company
is
simply
a
company
not
licensed
to
do
business
in
texas.
the
respondent
here
contracted
for
an
unauthorized
insurance
outside
the
state
of
texas,
paid
the
tax
under
protest
and
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
of
travis
county
to
recover
the
payments
of
these
taxes.
the
travis
county
court
held
that
the
respondent
should
recover,
the
state
been
appealed
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
sitting
in
austin
and
as
stated,
that
court
held
on
the
basis
of
the
allgeyer
holding
in
the
st.
louis
cotton
compress
holding
that
it
was
a
violation
of
federal
due
process.
then
the
state
applied
to
the
texas
supreme
court
for
an
application
for
writ
of
error.
the
texas
supreme
court
refused
to
grant
the
application
and
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
noted
that
it
refused
to
do
so
because
of
a
holding
of
this
court
in
the
allgeyer
case
and
in
the
st.
louis
cotton
compress
case.
the
question
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
or
not
texas
may
regulate
a
licensed
--
a
corporation
which
is
licensed
to
do
business
in
texas,
who
is
insuring
texas
property
at
risks
with
an
unauthorized
company
when
the
formalities
of
the
contract
were
made
outside
texas.
the
statement
of
facts
were
primarily
stipulated
in
the
trial
court
and
i
may
simply
and
i
believe
rather
rapidly
cover
them.
the
respondent
is
a
foreign
corporation,
a
new
york
corporation
in
fact
but
it
has
done
business
in
texas
since
1934.
it
owns
property
and
his
plants
in
galveston
and
houston
texas.
this
property
is
by
--
it's
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
$900,000.
at
these
plants,
it
employs
about
1500
people.
in
fact,
the
total
volume
of
business
of
the
respondent
amounts
to
about
27%.
that
is
done
in
texas
over
its
overall
operations
over
the
country.
now,
on
this
property,
certain
insurance
and
on
these
other
risks,
certain
insurance
was
purchased
with
these
unauthorized
companies
in
new
york.
now,
the
insurance
was
purchased
from
two
english
companies
and
it
is
stipulated
and
admitted
in
the
record
that
these
companies
are
not
authorized
insurance
companies
that
they
do
not
submit
to
any
regulation
in
any
form
or
any
fashion
to
the
texas
state
board
of
insurance.
now,
as
i
stated
a
moment
ago,
the
contracts
themselves
were
negotiated
for,
premiums
were
paid,
the
contracts
were
made
outside
of
texas
and
new
york.
in
fact,
in
the
contracts
themselves,
which
appear
in
the
record,
it
is
stated
that
as
between
the
insured,
that
is
todd,
and
as
between
the
insurance
company,
it
could
be
considered
that
the
contracts
were
made
in
new
york.
and
one
from
this
brief
resume
of
facts,
there
are
several
points
which
could
--
the
petitioner
feels
that
are
important
and
would
like
to
bring
to
attention
of
this
court.
one
that
--
that
todd
is
a
foreign
company
but
it
has
licensed
itself
to
do
business
in
texas
since
1934.
and
that
todd
did
purchase
the
insurance
from
unauthorized
companies
that
the
tax
in
question,
section
2
(e),
places
the
tax
on
the
insured,
that
is,
the
people
who
are
buying
the
insurance
and
add
up
on
the
insurance
company
which
admittedly
has
not
submitted
itself
to
the
regulation
by
texas.
at
this
time,
i
think
it
--
it's
important
that
the
section
2
(e)
or
of
article
2138
be
briefly
examined
and
the
purpose
of
the
background
of
statute
going
into.
petitioners
feel
that
the
purpose
of
the
tax
in
question
is
primarily
regulatory.
it
is
helpful
in
understanding
the
tax
to
know
something
about
the
background
of
insurance
regulation
in
texas
to
see
where
this
particular
tax
fits
into
regulatory
scheme.
prior
to
1876,
there
was
no
insurance
regulation
in
texas.
unfortunately,
the
era
is
well-known
as
one
in
which
the
insurance
business
did
frankly
what
it
was
--
what
it
wished
to
do
and
there
were
situations
for
a
frequent
failures,
financial
failures
by
the
insurance
company.
in
many
cases
in
that
period,
the
officials
of
the
insurance
companies
conducted
themselves
more
or
less
for
--
and
conducted
the
companies
more
or
less
for
their
own
benefit
rather
than
for
the
benefit
of
stockholders
of
the
companies
or
for
the
policy
holders
of
the
company.
in
this
period
also,
it
was
problem
of
discriminatory
rates
between
certain
insured
companies
and
insurers.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
mr.
justice,
prior
to
1876,
prior
to
any
state
regulation
--
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
--
by
the
board.
in
1876,
the
legislature
did
pass
an
act
setting
up
a
state
department
of
insurance
and
from
that
date,
down
to
the
present,
it
has
passed
various
laws
which
comprehensively
regulate
the
whole
of
the
insurance
business
in
texas.
the
present
regulatory
bodies
called
the
state
board
of
insurance
and
they
exercise,
as
i
say,
a
fairly
comprehensive
control
over
the
insurance
done
by
licensed
companies
in
the
state.
a
few
examples
of
the
kinds
of
regulations
which
were
imposed
by
the
state
board
or
the
fact
that
minimum
capital
and
surplus
are
required
to
be
met,
that
the
company's
license
do
business
in
texas
come
into
texas
and
submit
themselves
to
examination
by
examiner
by
the
state
board
of
insurance
that
these
companies
submit
annual
statements
of
their
financial
condition,
that
a
certain
kinds
of
insurance
rates
are
prescribed
by
the
board
and
other
kinds
of
insurance
policy
forms
are
even
prescribed
on
the
board.
now,
these
regulations
are
few
and
these
among
many
others
set
a
minimum
standard
of
performance
for
insurance
companies
which
operate
lawfully
in
texas.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
if
he
paid
the
tax
your
honor?
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
todd
did
pay
the
tax
your
honor
on
protest.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
through
certain
--
through
certain
agencies
your
honor,
through
article
21,
its
various
sections
within
the
act
to
setup
special
licensing
agency.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
that's
true
your
honor
--
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
alright,
your
honor,
it
actually
has
no
regulation
directly
on
lloyd's
of
london.
actually,
it
tends
to
end
the
encouragement
to
persons
owning
risks
in
texas
from
going
outside
the
companies
which
are
licensed
in
texas
to
purchase
insurance
because
of
placing
a
tax
on
these
transactions.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
in
effect,
yes.
as
i
have
stated
a
moment
ago,
the
purpose
of
the
tax
is
primarily
regulatory
and
this
is
revealed
in
the
first
section
of
21-2038
which
is
the
purpose
clause
and
stated
as
follows,
the
legislature
declares
that
it
is
the
subject
and
concern
that
the
placing
of
such
direct
lines
of
insurance
with
an
unauthorized
insurance
companies
is
not
properly
regulated.
as
i
stated
a
moment
ago,
2138
does
several
things.
in
section
2
--
or
subsection
(a),
(b),
(c),
and
(d),
it
sets
up
a
means
by
which
persons
owning
risks
in
texas
may
purchase
insurance
from
unauthorized
companies
if
they
will
go
through
specially
licensed
agents.
now,
these
agents
on
under
certain
categories
and
they
--
they
must
pass
certain
--
certain
test
before
they
can
provide
this
sort
of
insurance.
also,
the
agent
pays
a
5%
tax
upon
the
gross
premiums
taken
upon
these
transactions.
and
section
2
(e)
which
is
under
consideration
before
this
court,
the
--
is
in
effect
a
tax
which
is
used
as
a
regulation
to
--
as
mr.
justice
said
a
moment
ago
to
in
effect,
lessen
the
advantage
of
these
--
of
texas
people
owning
texas
risks
to
go
outside
the
state
and
purchase
insurance
from
unauthorized
companies.
now,
under
the
tax
--
under
the
tax,
it
is
the
person
purchasing
the
insurance
that
pays
the
tax
and
not
the
insurance
company.
and
as
i
stated
a
moment
ago,
the
unauthorized
insurer
is
not
one
licensed
by
the
state
board
of
insurance
and
could
be
one
of
several
kinds
of
insurance
companies.
it
could
be
a
non-licensed
insurance
company
of
a
foreign
country
or
it
could
be
a
non-licensed
insurance
company
of
another
state
or
for
that
matter,
it
could
be
a
domestic
company
which
had
not
complied
in
all
respects
with
the
regulations
of
state
of
texas.
now,
the
effect
of
this
tax
and
the
regulatory
effect
is
that
it
lessens
the
advantage
formally
enjoyed
to
unauthorized
insurers
and
that
they
could
insure
insurance
property
in
texas
at
a
lower
cost
and
could
companies
which
would
come
into
texas
and
submit
themselves
to
regulation
by
the
board.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
not
if
we
can
find
them
your
honor.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
possibly
so
this
--
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
yes
sir.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
the
other
effect
of
the
regulation
is
that
it
tends
to
equalize
the
burdens
of
the
regulatory
burden
among
all
the
risks
in
the
state
prior
to
section
2
(e)
only
those
risks
which
were
insured
with
authorized
companies
for
the
cost
of
the
regulation.
however,
it's
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
the
tax,
all
of
these
taxes
risks
more
important
because
of
the
regulation.
as
i
stated
a
moment
ago,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
found
in
or
based
its
opinion
upon
the
allgeyer
case
and
the
st.louis
cotton
compress
case.
these
cases
in
effect
held
that
a
state
was
powerless
to
regulate
contracts
of
insurance
own
risks
within
the
state
if
the
formalities
of
the
contract
were
made
outside
the
state's
borders.
it
was
said
in
those
cases
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
liberty
of
contract
and
as
such
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
due
process.
since
1897,
when
the
allgeyer
case
was
decided
and
at
later
points,
this
case
has
been
criticized
and
questioned
invalid
by
this
court.
specifically,
in
the
area
of
labor
legislation,
this
case
had
been
used
to
curtail
the
power
of
various
states
to
regulate
working
conditions
within
the
state.
in
1949,
the
linking
union
against
northwestern
case
expressly
repudiated
this
philosophy
which
curtailed
the
power
of
the
state
to
so
regulate.
i
think
it's
significant
that
each
time
within
the
last,
well,
20
years
that
this
court
has
been
confronted
with
the
allgeyer
case,
our
president
based
upon
the
allgeyer
decisions
that
the
court
has
either
overruled
that
president
or
has
made
distinctions
which
in
effect
avoid
deciding
on
that
case.
some
of
these
cases
or
the
osborn
against
ozlin
case,
the
hoopeston
against
cullen
case.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
the
travelers'
insurance
against
virginia
and
the
watson
against
employers
casualty
company
cases.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
this
approach
--
a
new
approach
has
been
demonstrated
by
these
cases
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
state
attempting
to
regulate
insurance
within
its
borders.
this
approach
is
one
of
the
realistic
inquiries
into
the
interest
of
the
state
which
is
attempting
to
regulate
the
insurance.
first
of
these
cases
and
probably
the
most
important
from
the
standpoint
of
this
lawsuit
is
the
osborn
against
ozlin
case
which
was
decided
in
1940
by
this
court.
there,
virginia
required
that
insurance
companies
which
were
licensed
in
texas
--
in
virginia
excuse
me,
and
which
were
insuring
risks
in
virginia
to
purchase
insurance
to
licensed
agents
in
virginia
then
it
was
contended
in
that
case
that
this
was
an
interference
with
the
contracts
since
these
contracts
were
admittedly
made
out
in
new
york,
and
it
was
placing
a
burden
upon
the
contracts
that
the
state
could
not
validly
do.
have
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
simply
because
there
are
repercussions
across
state
lines
in
this
matter
that
it
did
not
invalidate
the
legislation
if
virginia
had
a
definable
interest
in
the
contracts
of
insurance
sought
to
be
regulated.
the
petitioner
submits
to
this
court
that
the
interests
of
texas
and
the
insurance
contracts
here
involved
is
certainly
is
--
as
substantial
as
those
in
virginia
in
the
osborn
case.there,
the
person
sought
to
be
regulated
was
in
virginia.
here,
the
person
regulated
or
taxed
is
in
texas.
there,
the
risks
were
located
in
virginia
and
here,
the
risks
are
located
in
texas.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
that's
true
your
honor
and
we
feel
that
in
order
to
hope
and
state,
this
court
would
have
to
overrule
st.
louis
--
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
compress
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
the
next
case
announcing
this
new
approach
in
the
regulatory
approach
is
the
hoopeston
against
cullen.
this
case
upheld
the
validity
of
new
york
regulation
of
reciprocal
insurance
companies.
in
those
--
even
though
the
contracts
in
those
cases
were
made
in
illinois,
the
premiums
were
made
in
illinois
and
the
attorney
in
fact
was
located
in
--
in
illinois.
the
--
of
course,
the
contention
was
made
there
based
upon
the
allgeyer
line
of
principles
that
the
state
could
not
interfere
with
the
making
of
contracts
outside
the
state.
however,
the
court
said
that
in
determining
the
power
of
state
to
regulate
that
the
conceptualistic
approach
employed
in
the
allgeyer
line
of
cases
no
longer
was
to
be
employed
but
instead
recognize
that
a
court
might
have
a
substantial
--
that
a
state
might
have
a
substantial
interest
in
the
insurance
of
persons
located
within
that
state
or
property
located
within
that
state.
the
interest
in
the
regulation
could
be
measured
by
such
realistic
considerations
as
protection
of
the
citizen
involved
or
the
protection
of
the
state
from
incidents
of
loss.
in
that
case,
it
was
much
emphasized
that
the
risks
of
property
was
located
in
new
york,
the
state
attempting
to
regulate.
in
fact,
the
court
stated
there
then
i
quote,
“there's
no
more
reason
to
bar
the
state
from
authority
over
the
insurance
of
property
within
it
and
to
exclude
it
and
control
of
all
other
property
interest
mentioned.”
the
next
case
that
the
petitioner
feels
important
in
this
field
is
the
travelers
health
association
against
virginia.
it
is
a
jurisdiction
case.
we
feel
that
it's
important
because
in
that
case,
the
allgeyer
line
of
cases
was
heard
before
the
court
and
the
court
refused
to
be
bound
by
that
group
of
cases.
there,
the
virginia
government
had
issued
a
cease-and-desist
order
against
certain
mail
order
insurance
activities
of
the
nebraska
corporation.
there,
the
contracts
were
made
in
nebraska
and
it
was
maintained
that
since
they
were
made
in
nebraska,
virginia
could
not
reach
them.
have
the
court
found
that
virginia
did
have
a
power
to
issue
the
cease-and-desist
order.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
no
sir,
your
honor
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
taking
that
position.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
your
honor,
i
believe
there
is
authority
in
the
osborn
case
which
could
possibly
sustain
the
state
in
that
contention,
yes.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that
your
honor
whether
we
have
the
power.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
i
think
your
honor,
the
federal
courts
are
open
to
all
persons
who
wish
to
litigate
there
and
have
these
requisite
conditions
in
their
cases.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
pardon
me?
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
that's
right.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
well,
now
your
honor,
there
are
certain
conditions
that
can
be
laid
down
for
foreign
corporation
before
it
can
come
in
and
if
they
don't
meet
those
conditions
--
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
--
you
can
exclude
them.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
no
sir,
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
could
make
that
condition.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
no,
it's
not
settled
your
honor.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
i
think
it's
much
less
doubtful.
not
--
not
--
your
honor,
are
you
speaking
of
your
second
hypothetical
situation
as
referred
to
the
cases
--
the
case
barred
here?
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
no
sir,
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
you
a
moment
ago.
i
think
we
could
do
that.
i
think
it's
constitutionally
possible
to
acquire
these
--
these
exactions.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
i
feel
that
under
holding
the
osborn
case
that
the
state
probably
could
exercise
that
power
your
honor.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
well,
no,
that
wasn't
the
case
but
there's
language
in
the
osborn
--
osborn
against
ozlin
case
that
would
indicate
the
state
does
have
that
power.
the
language
was,
i
believe,
that
the
state
could
preempt
the
field
of
insurance
if
it
so
wished.
if
it
did
not,
he
could
do
less
than
what
it
could
do
that
is
--
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
yes,
sir.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
well,
the
same
considerations
your
honor
would
--
would
be
involved
there.
i
can
feel
that
in
determinating
--
determining
after
all,
you're
concerned
about
the
residents
who
will
take
this
insurance
if
you're
controlling
the
insurance
company.
you're
not
so
much
concerned
about
the
insurance
company
itself.
here,
in
this
situation
which
you
opposed,
this
is
simply
a
way
of
determining
that
these
residents
of
texas
would
be
--
have
insurance
that
at
least
met
a
certain
minimum
requirements.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
your
honor,
i
will
now
go
into
the
texas
interest
in
the
insurance
contracts
involved
here.
one
of
the
interests
involved
is
the
fact
that
the
risks
are
located
here
and
the
cases,
the
osborn
case
and
in
the
hoopeston
case,
both
these
cases
emphasize
--
emphasized
a
fact
that
the
risks
were
located
in
texas.
now,
these
risks
are
substantial
risks.
they're
not
few
bales
of
cotton
as
in
the
allgeyer
case
which
were
mainly
shipped
out
and
left
the
confines
of
louisiana
but
these
will
remain
in
texas
for
the
--
for
the
most
part.
another
factor
is
the
fact
that
the
insured
that
is
the
respondent
here
is
located
in
texas.
in
case
of
failure
or
the
inability
of
casualty
company
to
pay
for
large
casualty
loses,
some
1500
--
certain
economic
consequences
would
be
sure
to
be
felt
by
the
state
of
texas,
some
1500
people
would
more
or
less
be
unemployed
if
the
todd
shipyards
corporation
offices
there
were
closed.
state
agencies
would
be
caught
upon
the
supply
relief
in
that
situation
and
of
course
loss
of
purchasing
power
would
have
adverse
effect
on
the
business
community
in
general.
another
important
factor
is
your
honor
that
the
events
which
give
rise
to
contractual
obligation
to
pay
on
these
policies
will
more
than
likely
to
occur
in
texas.
in
case
of
some
of
the
insurances
involved,
persons
compensated
will
be
residents
of
texas
and
they
will
be
resorting
to
texas
courts
more
than
likely
unless
they
wish
to
resort
to
distant
forums
which
would
cause
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
expense.
the
people
having
a
claim
under
the
liabilicy
--
liability
policies
here
would
be
treated
in
texas
hospitals
by
texas
doctors
and
unless
reimbursed
by
insurance
may
well
become
more
of
the
state
or
dependence
upon
residents
of
texas
to
take
care
of.
also,
the
state
does
extend
police
protection
to
the
respondent.
it
makes
it
possible
for
the
respondent
to
carry
on
a
profitable
business
in
texas.
texas,
i
feel
also
has
the
vital
interest
in
the
effective
enforcement
of
its
regulatory
program.
as
i've
stated
a
moment
ago
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
act,
there
had
been
certain
regulatory
--
certain
regulatory
scheme
setup.
however,
after
the
passage
of
--
there
was
this
gap
existing,
this
was
passed
and
attempt
to
close
this
as
much
as
possible
and
the
effect
simply
was
that
it
lessen
the
advantage
of
an
unauthorized
insurance
companies
which
they
get
previously
--
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
yes
sir.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
pre
--
previously,
your
honor
people
in
texas
who
--
who
could
--
who
owned
risk
in
texas
could
insure
with
unauthorized
companies
and
the
authorized
companies
could
afford
to
offer
him
insurance
for
a
lesser
rate.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
because
he
didn't
have
to
pay
any
taxes
that
the
licensed
companies
didn't
have
to
pay.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
that
would
make
any
difference.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
well,
your
honor
we
feel
that
the
tax
placed
upon
the
domestic
companies
is
in
turned
passed
to
the
risks
involved.
here,
then
in
that
case
a
risk
insured
with
the
licensed
company
would
bear
a
greater
--
a
proportionate
cost
or
in
--
as
against
a
risk
that
was
insured
with
an
unauthorized
company
--
no
burden
whatsoever
until
this
tax
was
passed.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
your
honor,
with
all
do
deference
to
your
honor's
conclusion,
i
feel
--
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
i
feel
that
this
is
not
the
case.
a
tax
is
only
used
as
a
regulatory
device.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
well,
it
places
a
tax
upon
this
--
this
--
this
transaction
or
this
--
this
person
purchasing
the
insurance
and
that
person
is
less
likely
to
purchase
that
insurance
if
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
this
tax.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
that's
correct.
i
feel
that
we
have
gone
--
we
stop
short
that
the
power
of
the
state
could
have
exercised
and
we
have
--
by
this
section
2
(e)
have
--
as
your
honor
appraised,
applied
to
pay
some
pressure.
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
the
respondent
is
only
one
of
many
large
from
all
the
state
concerns
which
tax
insurance
with
unauthorized
insurance
companies.
if
section
2
(e)
is
struck
down,
many
of
these
insurers
will
seek
insurance
elsewhere,
texas
would
find
itself
from
the
position
of
having
many
of
its
largest
and
most
hazardous
risks
authorized
in
companies
that
it
has
no
control
over
whatsoever.
not
only
--
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
well,
we
feel
that
the
legislature
--
mr.
bob
e.
shannon
had
a
choice
and
it
could
--
it
may
well
pay
such
--
such
a
statute.
and
we
feel
that
if
section
2
(e)
is
struck
down,
it
will
not
only
take
long
for
those
insurers
who
are
now
submitting
a
texas
regulation
to
realize
that
they
can
go
outside
the
state
and
escape
the
burden
of
texas
regulation
and
still
insure
in
texas
risks.
we
feel
that
texas
has
legitimate
interest
in
keeping
these
licensed
companies
in
texas.
it
is
submitted,
your
honors,
that
the
interest
which
i
have
outlined
or
ever
been
a
substantial
as
those
in
the
osborn
case
or
in
hoopeston
case
and
we
feel
for
that
reason
that
the
court
of
civil
appeals
opinion
should
be
overruled.
co-counsel
would
like
to
reserve
mr.
chief
justice
20
minutes
in
rebuttal.
