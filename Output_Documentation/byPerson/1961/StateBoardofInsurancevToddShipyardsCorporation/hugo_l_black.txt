what
do
you
mean
by
lessen
the
advantage
practically?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
texas
have
called
this
a
purchase
tax,
would
that
had
made
any
difference?
suppose
they
would
have
charged
so
much
for
each
policy
purchased
by
a
merchant
living
in
texas,
and
apply
that
to
a
purchase
or
policies
bought
in
other
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
ask.
i
said
suppose
they
had
put
a
purchase
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
a
claim
you're
talking
about
now,
you
said
that
to
make
it
compensate,
put
them
on
a
level
with
the
others,
you
had
to
put
on
this
step.
suppose
instead
of
putting
it
in
this
form,
texas
had
put
a
purchase
tax
on
every
purchaser
of
insurance
in
the
state,
would
there
been
any
reason
why
it
couldn't
put
on
this
one
this
--
this
out
of
state
company,
or
purchasers
from
it
by
taking
it
directly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
are
you
arguing
if
that's
in
substance,
what
you're
doing
here
that
you
--
states
impose
taxes
on
the
companies
that
do
business
in
texas
and
then
in
order
to
compensate
for
it,
it's
necessary
to
require
the
purchasers
from
non-authorized
texas
company
to
pay
this
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
with
reference
to
the
discriminatory
feature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
reference
to
the
statement
made
by
mr.
justice
holmes
in
his
dissent
explaining
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
in
the
philippine
case
where
he
said
the
result
uphold
--
holding
the
government's
action
is
just
when
a
tax
--
taxes
domestic
insurance,
if
reasonable,
may
endeavor
not
to
let
the
foreign
insurance
escape.
justice
hugo
l.
black
based
on
the
penalty
you
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
a
penalty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
discriminatory
in
what
respect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
the
insurer,
admitted
insurer,
the
one
that's
admitted
in
the
state
has
to
pay
various
taxes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
they
stuck
to
the
opinion
with
that
--
the
holmes'
opinion
with
that
interpretation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
justice
holmes
who
had
written
the
compress
case
would
not
agree
to
that
and
later
on,
quite
a
number
of
statements
have
been
made
about
the
allgeyer
and
the
compress
case
which
fit
more
nearly
into
mr.
justice
holmes'
dissent,
have
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
you
agreed
that
louisiana
or
texas
could
regulate
the
types
of
contract
that
should
be
made
on
property
in
louisiana
or
texas.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
types
of
contract
of
insurance
that
can
be
made
and
be
effective
in
that
state
on
louisiana
and
texas
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
they
couldn't
regulate
in
any
other
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
claxton
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
claxton
case?
does
that
have
any
bearing
on
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
texas
policy
on
the
light
that
was
held
--
texas
had
a
policy
against
letting
non-relatives
by
insurer
be
the
beneficiaries
of
insurance
to
pay
for
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
effects
--
effect
of
it
was
whether
you
call
it
conflict
or
constitutional
that
they
refuse
to
let
a
contract
be
enforced
that
has
been
made
that
would
be
valid
at
another
place,
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
mean
to
say
it's
controlling
here
but
i
think
it
has
(voice

where

did

justice

l.
black
where
did
this
case
come
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
sometimes
you
have
to
cut
it
and
mix
it
up.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
changes
the
aspect
of
it.
