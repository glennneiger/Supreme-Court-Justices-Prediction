justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
still
can't
understand
the
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
--
i
didn't
understand
you
to
claim
that
texas
could
compel
the
insurance
to
be
written
by
a
state
insurance
company
or
state
licensed
insurance
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
ask
you
then
this.
could
texas
pass
a
statute
saying
that
this
foreign
corporation
shall
be
excluded
from
doing
business
in
the
state
until
and
unless
it
takes
out
insurance
in
the
foreign
--
in
a
state
regulated
insurance
company?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
--
could
texas
say
that
you
can't
remove
a
case
to
the
federal
court
if
you
take
out
insurance
in
the
foreign
insurance
company?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
do
you
think
those
cases
are
more
doubtful
in
this
case
if
it
can't
exclude
the
corporation
that's
within
it
from
doing
business
on
that
condition,
if
it
can't
exclude
it
from
going
--
from
removing
a
case,
the
starting
case
in
the
federal
court?
it
must
be
because
that's
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
to
impose
such
a
condition
and
why.
what's
the
difference
in
that
in
exacting
a
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
let
him
in
at
all,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
let
him
in
if
you
can
keep
him
out
for
any
reason
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
said
you
can't
impose
that
condition,
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
exclude
them
for
that
reason.
you
can't
exclude
them
--
you
can't
make
it
as
a
condition
if
they
should
central
to
the
federal
courts,
that's
what's
called
an
unconstitutional
condition,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
it's
not
clear
whether
they
could
say
you
can't
--
you
must
take
out
insurance
from
a
company
over
which
we
have
power
of
regulation,
that
certainly
is
not
settled,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
think
it's
more
doubtful
or
less
doubtful
to
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
instead
of
doing
what
texas
did
here,
it
said
outright,
we
have
supervisory
control
over
the
insurance
company
that
do
business
in
their
state.
we
make
certain
exaction
as
to
reserves,
as
to
the
percentage
of
--
control
over
dividends
etcetera,
etcetera,
investigatorial
power
by
the
commission
of
insurance
or
whatever
your
regulatory
body
is.
and
therefore,
we
want
to
have
that
kind
of
control.
now,
if
you
think
it's
doubtful
whether
he
could
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
constitutionally
--
it's
constitutionally
clear
you
think
for
texas
to
say
to
a
--
to
a
resident
in
texas,
you
must
take
out
insurance
from
a
company
that
does
business
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
isn't
quite
that
case,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
a
language
indicating
that
when
you
deal
with
insurance
--
when
you
deal
with
the
insurance
business
long
history
and
adjudication
indicates
that
there's
a
--
if
that
comes
so
close
to
--
to
the
safety
and
the
interest
of
the
state,
you
can
do
a
good
deal
to
control
the
insurance
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
a
very
different
thing
to
--
to
tell
a
resident
of
dallas
or
houston
or
fort
worth
that
if
he's
going
to
get
insurance
at
all,
he
must
take
it
--
he
must
take
it
from
a
local
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
texas
of
interest
in
that,
that
the
fellow
should
be
protected
against
himself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
have
to
impose
the
purchase
tax
and
everybody
who
purchase
their
insurance,
wouldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
all
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
how
--
how
getting
money
into
the
treasury
of
texas,
safeguards
the
safety
interest
etcetera,
etcetera.
i
can
understand
how
--
i
understand
that
texas
said,
insurance
is
very
important,
it
doesn't
affect
merely
the
insured
person
but
it
affects
as
you
indicate
those
people
out
of
employment,
it
may
--
the
buyer
may
go
beyond
the
immediate
unit
etcetera,
etcetera.
therefore,
we
have
a
very
strong
interest
or
adequate
interest
to
see
to
it
that
buyer
protection
is
adequate,
especially.
therefore,
we
want
to
have
insurance
companies
who
can
control
by
an
oversight
etcetera,
etcetera.
but
as
much
as
texas
is
done,
texas
simply
says,
“we
want
to
make
money
out
of
the
person
who
wants
to
insure
himself
outside
the
state.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
no
conclusion,
i'm
asking
a
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
how
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
that's
merely
of
--
as
you
say,
this
operates
a
special
concept
to
get
insured
by
locally
regulated
company.
but
suppose
for
better
or
bad
reasons,
some
big
concerns
and
the
questions
referred
to
take
insurance
from
companies
that
a
resident
in
localize
new
york
or
in
chicago
or
whatnot,
some
of
the
insurance
companies
is
in
massachusetts.
but
what
you're
saying
is
the
likelihood
of
pressure
is
sufficient
state
--
about
the
interest
of
the
state
and
its
interest
of
the
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
cut
short
the
use
of
bludgeoning
tax,
your
result
in
which
for
one
reason
or
another,
you
do
not
think
it's
important
enough
to
impose
directly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless,
the
fact
of
such
a
statute
as
i've
suggested
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
a
choice,
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
lloyd's
could
be
admitted
to
do
business
in
texas,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
that
they
had
paid
no
attention
to
mean
that
the
statute
has
not
been
formally
repealed
but
it's
not
been
enforced
to
attach
and
enforce
which?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
a
lot
of
people
didn't
like
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
view,
could
texas
make
fire
insurance
compulsory
on
texas
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
--
if
they
could
do
that,
couldn't
they
also
provide
that
the
kind
of
assurance
that
insurance
should
afford?
in
other
words,
couldn't
they
provide
that
insurance
must
be
by
some
responsible
companies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
speculate
a
little
bit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it's
relevant
to
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
it
is
suggested
that
when
we
reconsider
the
wisdom
of
our
predecessors
otherwise
it
may
have
been,
what
do
you
think?
do
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
texas
could
provide
insurance
should
be
taking
out
fire
insurance
on
all
texas
realties?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
make
a
difference
if
i
suggest
that
the
questions
i'm
asking
leading
--
lead
up
to
a
question
that
might
have
helped
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you
--
can
i
ask
you
--
is
it
your
situation
on
this
aspect
of
your
argument
more
likely
other
insurance
case
that
this
court
had
about
at
least
an
insurance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
where
we
get
some
overruling
at
least
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
take
if
you
--
you
argue
that
the
earlier
--
the
allgeyer
decision
and
the
compress
case
are
as
a
matter
of,
what
we
lawyers
call,
as
a
matter
of
principal
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
merely
that
they
own
their
right,
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
a
lot
of
tall
talk
in
the
allgeyer
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wasn't
referring
to
that.
i
was
referring
to
the
generality
of
language.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
lots
of
general
language.
justice
felix
frankfurter
different
hands
wrote
the
difference
of
the
two
opinions,
two
different
people
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
it's
long
doesn't
make
it
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
it's
long
doesn't
make
it
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here
we
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
would
you
mind
stating
what
you
conceived
to
be
the
--
what
you
call
the
allgeyer
doctrine
as
against
the
decision
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
doctrine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
you
need
an
overruling
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
risk
was
outside
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
of
a
fleeting
character
of
the
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
doctrine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it
the
other
way
around,
not
what
formalities
takes
place
outside
the
state
but
what
transpires
within
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
fact
that
something
occurs
outside
the
state
doesn't
preclude
or
ex
--
preclude
the
state
from
exclusion.
it's
from
dealing
with
something
that
it
is
--
its
legitimate
concern.
i
know
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
question
adequate
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
can't
just
say
if
its
--
if
formalities
are
outside
fresno,
the
state
--
the
internal
state
has
no
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
to
look
both
who
takes
out
or
takes
place
inside
of
a
taxing
or
a
governing
state
as
well
as
what
relation
that
has
to
what
goes
on
outside.
so
the
crucial
question
is
what
takes
place
inside
on
which
they
file
a
confession.
now,
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
word
you
use
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
an
event
if
you
please
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
a
phenomenon
within
the
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
mere
fact
that
you've
got
--
the
piece
of
property
in
the
state
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
can
do
anything
in
relation
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
question
is
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
you
were
cutting
it
a
little
short
to
say
that
all
that
follows
allgeyer
was
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
were
formalities
outside
taxing
or
regulating
state
exclude
that
state
from
regulating
or
taxing.
that
would
be
too
easy.
the
mere
fact
that
some
formality
in
relation
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--the
government
or
taxing
events
can
take
place
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
real
--
all
your
argument,
all
the
state's
argument
are
drawn
from
the
fact
that
this
is
realty
situate
within
texas,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
to
say
what
kind
of
insurance
or
whether
you
should
take
insurance
but
the
tax
because
you
take
insurance
from
--
from
one
company
rather
than
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
levy
because
you
don't
take
insurance
from
a
local
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
state
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
how
that
--
how
that
in
--
suppose,
the
todd
ship
building
--
shipyard
burns
down,
i
don't
see
the
fact
that
you've
collected
last
year's
taxes,
helps
to
see
to
it
that
the
todd
shipyard
doesn't
go
up
in
a
fluke.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
you
can
therefore
tax
them
the
way
you
tax
everybody
else
or
if
you
had
a
state
insurance,
suppose
texas
goes
in
for
a
state
--
for
a
state
owned
or
a
state
conducted
fire
insurance
system
or
health
insurance
system
or
whatnot,
i
suppose
you
have
hail
in
texas,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
ignorance
sprouts
from
new
york
and
boston?
i
suppose
you
could
tax
--
tax
them
to
contribute
to
the
maintenance
of
an
insurance
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
know
what
you're
doing
here.
you
say
you
tax
them
because
they
don't
insure
in
a
texas
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
regulatory
aspect
of
this
statute
is
that
as
your
colleagues
indicated
that
it
would
exert
pressure
to
take
out
local
insurance
to
avoid
this
exception.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
--
that's
the
regulatory
aspect
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
--
are
you
suggesting
that
there's
a
new
thought
that
had
been
drawn
on
into
the
offer?
you're
suggesting
that
by
making
--
by
exacting
a
tax
on
--
writing
on
the
--
taking
out
insurance
of
a
foreign
or
a
non-texas
company,
you
--
you
discourage
texas
insurance
people
from
--
from
leaving
the
state,
you
don't
encourage
them
to
stay
there
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
these
outsiders
were
not
subject
to
the
regulatory
system
of
texas
allowed
profitably
to
take
the
right
insurance
in
texas
then
the
texas
people
will
all
flee
texas
including
new
york
and
connecticut
and
elsewhere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
thought
is
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
this
is
a
is
a
pretty
--
a
pretty
--
what
shall
i
say?
fancible
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
these
people
or
insurance
companies
are
in
texas
or
--
or
come
to
texas
or
otherwise
working.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
is
the
primary
insurer
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
reinsurers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
fully
--
flee
the
united
states
altogether?
if
this
--
your
argument
is
valid
and
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
to
myself
i
can
well
understand
a
state,
making
certain
requirements
for
insurability,
of
realty
within
its
confines
but
that
isn't
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
me
they're
very
different
things.
