justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
the
allegation
was
that
he
actually
was
sent
there
by
cbs.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
this
for
cbs.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
he
get
out
of
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
bad.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
fredericksburg
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
fredericksburg
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
are
these
tv
programs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

section.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
manufacture
receiving
sets
(inaudible)
and
they
get
both.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
has
cbs
acquired
the
third
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
judge
rosenman,
were
there
any
other
localities
or
as
many,
i
think
mr.
wolf
said
200
thousand
conversions
have
been
made
whether
--
are
the
others
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
--
perhaps,
i
misunderstood
mr.
wolf.
i
thought
he
said
that
poller
had
succeeded
in
getting
something
like
that
number
of
conversions
at
$20
a
piece
or
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
get
this
judge
rosenman,
the
network
may
own
only
five
vhf
stations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
that
at
all
times
we're
involved
with
here
you
already
had
your
five?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
were
the
other
two?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
other
cities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
were
your
five
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
--
were
your
five
exhausted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
by
affiliation,
you
couldn't
have
another
vhf
station.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
couldn't
buy
anything
else
in
milwaukee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
tell
this
the
original
contract
of
purchase
had
a
provision
for
location
and
something
else,
transmitter
site,
was
it?
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
show
the
circumstances
under
which
that
deletion
was
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
know
yet.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
had
been
a
trial
develop
that
in
fact
the
deletion
was
at
the
instance
of
cbs
and
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
judge
rosenman
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
mr.
holt
would
rather
have
the
emphasis
on
the
whole
circumstances
involving
holt's
part
in
this
as
bearing
on
the
issue
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
conspiracy
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
--
you
argued
yesterday
as
i
recall
it
mr.
wolf
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
argued
yesterday
as
i
recall
it
but
you
are
under
no
obligation
to
produce
all
your
proofs
in
resisting
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nor
to
examine
all
of
the
witnesses
of
the
other
side,
nor
to
cross-examine
all
the
witnesses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
in
face
of
that
argument,
aren't
you
really
suggesting
that
at
least
in
this
kind
of
case
or
perhaps
only
in
this
particular
case,
summary
judgment
is
not
an
appropriate
procedure
for
its
disposition.
