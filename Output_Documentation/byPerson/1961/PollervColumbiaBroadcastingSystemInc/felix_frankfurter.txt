mr.
wolf,
may
i
interrupt
you
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
summary
judgment,
on
page
278
excerpts
from
the
official
transcript,
the
trial
court
said
i
am
going
to
assume
the
fact
to
be
as
claimed
by
the
plaintiff
for
the
purposes
of
this
motion,
would
you
mind
elucidating
that
for
a
moment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
did
you
say
the
consideration
was
--
the
total
consideration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
woky,
bartell's.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
holt
got
$10,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
the
330
or
was
an
addition
to
the
330?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
please
tell
me
whether
the
difference
whether
there
is
a
difference
in
context
--
content
or
difference
in
receptivity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
--
either
the
driving
of
the
affiliation
or
cancellation
requires
the
intervention
of
the
fcc.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
usual
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask,
the
various
business
tactics
that
mr.
wolf
referred
to
in
the
invidious
sense
in
which
--
the
invidious
inferences
could
be
drawn
from
that
on
(inaudible),
did
this
precede
or
follow
the
desire
of
cbs
to
acquire
either
poller's
station
or
bartell's
station?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
even
uncle
sam
--
or
even
uncle
sam
buying
a
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
mean
uncle
--
i
mean
imminent
domain
i'm
thinking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
whether
about
the
broker
but
the
point
is
equally
applicable
that
uncle
sam
doesn't
--
does
know
at
times
that
he's
going
speak
to
condemn
because
the
price
will
go
up
against
even
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
is
good
enough
for
uncle
sam
etcetera?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
that
the
question
is
that
â€“
the
suggestion
of
the
chief
justice's
question
is
that
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
that
the
affiliation
would
not
be
terminated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
certain
step
for
taking
in
reliance
upon
that
reasonable
expectation.
i
think
that's
the
thrust
of
the
question
what
he
said
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
practical
matter,
how
does
the
station
like
wtop
take
against
the
unexpected
if
you
please,
termination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
ask
a
question
that
is
more
proper
or
more
directed
to
mr.
wolf.
but
he
sat
down
before
he
had
a
chance
to
deal
with
it.
namely
when
i
asked
him
about
the
statement
by
the
trial
court,
that
he
assumed
all
of
the
fact
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
here,
mr.
wolf
said
as
i
compare
to
his
--
my
memory,
and
according
to
his
answer
that
that's
what
he
said
but
that
is
what
he
did.
now,
may
i
ask
you
from
your
point
of
view,
what
is
the
justification
for
that
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
you
didn't
--
you're
saying
you
did
it
below.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that
but
the
plaintiff
is
to
do
it,
it's
below.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
you
do
it,
it's
below,
if
it's
to
be
ineffective
i
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
was
there
a
controversy
as
to
what
was
material
and
what
was
immaterial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
add
some
--
may
i
put
it
in
a
very
concrete
form
with
the
question
i
put
originally?
i
was
saying
that
the
summary
judgment
resulted
from
your
concession
that
nothing
that
witnesses
would
be
allowed
to
testify
to
as
relevant
at
a
time,
nothing
failed
to
be
conceded
by
you,
nothing
that's
really
in
the
area
of
evidentiary
testimony
as
against
the
significance
to
be
drawing
things,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
anything
that
you
would
be
allowed
to
put
through
witness,
not
what
the
charge
of
the
judgment
be
on
what
he
testifies,
whether
in
short,
you
will
shut
all
from
putting
through
witnesses
what
they
are
entitled
to
put
through
witnesses
as
against
having
been
conceded
by
the
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
judge
washington
say
that
facts
were
shut
off
which
if
they
had
been
unused,
would
have
trade
a
legal
conspiracy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
have
made
a
legal
establishing
services?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
not
mean
that
from
what
was
incontestable,
factual
territory,
the
court
drew
one
conclusion
and
he
drew
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
--
and
i'm
questioning,
i'm
not
charging,
i
just
want
to
know.
are
you
saying
that
in
every
case
charging
a
conspiracy
under
the
current
law,
in
every
case
the
matter
must
go
to
a
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
there
--
are
you
saying
that
in
the
sherman
law
case,
a
concession
that
the
fact
it
testifies
to
by
witnesses
will
be
what
the
complaint
sets
forth
as
fact.
are
you
saying
that
that
can't
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
holt,
this
court
in
these
sherman
law
cases,
sometimes
reversing,
something
affirming.
in
case
of
reversing
concludes
that
something
is
or
isn't
a
restraint
of
trade.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
we
have
to
call
in
the
jury
to
help
us
reach
a
conclusion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
inferences
are
inevitably
subject
to
controversy?
