mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
your
honors
please,
the
decisions
below
were
based
upon
the
acceptance
of
all
of
the
material
facts
which
were
alleged
by
the
petitioner
here,
poller.
if
you
say
that
we
did
not
accept
statements
about
code
names
and
things
like
that,
those
are
what
we
designate
as
immaterial
statements.
they
are
the
kind
of
antitrust
language
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
in
the
preceding
case
as
newspaper
antitrust
language.
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
very
simply,
but
very
definitely,
was
section
1
violated?
was
section
2
violated?
and
it
does
no
good
to
talk
about
getting
called
up
and
having
trade
names,
code
names
and
things
like
that.
perhaps
the
court
doesn't
agree
that
that's
the
way
this
business
should
be
conducted,
but
this
court
has
held
in
the
eastern
railroad
case
that
disputes
about
business
ethics
are
not
questions
of
antitrust
law.
even
unfair
means
of
competition,
which
judge
washington
referred
to
below,
have
nothing
to
do
with
private
suits
for
treble
damages.
those
are
things
which
the
federal
trade
commission
can
issue
a
cease-and-desist
order,
but
they're
not
things
for
which
a
man
can
sue
in
treble
damages.
here,
we
have
involved
the
question,
was
there
under
the
clayton
act,
an
injury
to
the
business
or
property
of
mr.
poller
by
anything
forbidden
in
the
antitrust
laws?
we
say
that
columbia
caused
no
injury
to
mr.
poller
and
we
say
that
nothing
that
columbia
did
was
forbidden
by
the
antitrust
laws.
we
have
no
disagreement
with
the
facts,
but
there
are
certain
facts
which
my
friend
neglected
to
tell
you
which
i
must.
at
the
time
when
cbs
decided
because
of
its
long
displayed
interest
in
uhf,
which
was
a
means
of
opening
up
the
spectrum
so
that
there
would
be
more
competition
in
television
broadcasting.
there
was
the
following
condition
in
milwaukee.
there
were
three
vhf
channels
authorized
and
one
operating.
there
were
three
uhf
channels
authorized
and
two
operating.
cbs
made
up
its
mind
that
when
the
commission
permitted
networks
to
buy
two
uhf
stations
in
addition
to
five
uhf
stations
--
vhf
stations
that
one
of
the
places
it
would
buy
a
uhf
station
would
be
milwaukee.
perhaps
your
honors
are
not
entirely
familiar
with
the
difference
between
vhf
and
uhf
stations.
vhf
stations
are
the
stations
which
have
been
on
the
air
since
back
in
1949.
uhf
stations,
the
entire
opening
of
the
uhf
spectrum
have
been
authorized
only
since
1952.
now
although,
it
has
been
authorized
since
1952,
your
honors
can
take
judicial
notice
that
here
in
the
city
of
washington,
there
was
never
a
uhf
station
until
just
recently.
and
the
recent
uhf
station
is
purely
educational
supported
by
charitable
contributions,
not
a
commercial
station,
not
competing
with
the
vhf
and
incidentally,
it's
a
station
which
your
honors
cannot
get
unless
you
buy
an
adapter,
modify
your
antenna
and
seek
the
good
offices
of
repairmen.
i
can't
get
them
in
my
hotel
room.
i
mention
that
to
show
to
your
honors
that
uhf
has
a
very,
very
difficult
job
competing
with
vhf.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
uhf
stations
have
gone
down
in
numbers
while
the
vhf
station
--
stations
are
increasing
in
numbers.
this
is
all
through
the
record
your
honors,
but
the
dis
--
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
taken
judicial
notice
of
this
time
and
again
that
uhf
cannot
compete
with
vhf
under
the
normal
circumstances.
now
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
there
is
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
well,
in
different
localities,
there
are
certain
numbers
of
channels
which
are
vhf,
but
the
number
of
stations
has
increased
since
the
time
of
this
episode
with
poller
in
milwaukee,
but
if
uhf
were
received
on
equal
terms
with
vhf,
by
then
there
would
be
many
more
channels.
for
example
in
washington,
you
have
four
channels
of
vhf.
there
would
be
many
more
channels
on
which
you
could
get
other
programs
and
all
you're
able
to
get
in
uhf
in
washington
and
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
an
educational
station
providing
that
you
go
to
the
expense
and
trouble
that
i
have
indicated.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
they
are
beginning
--
they
are
not
--
there
are
some
companies
that
do
manufacture
and
the
fcc
is
trying
to
get
set
manufacturers
to
put
some
sort
of
a
jack
in
the
end,
or
a
jack
in
so
that
they
can
be
converted
to
uhf.
the
fact
is
that
even
--
even
with
this
jack,
the
set
is
more
expensive
than
a
similar
vhf
set,
so
that
there
is
extreme
discouragement
about
uhf
television.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
there's
only
a
difference
in
receptivity
and
in
expense.
the
uhf
station
in
washington
broadcasts
very
astronomical
programs
now
which
your
honor
could
see
if
your
set
were
equipped
for
that.
now,
this
is
a
situation
when
columbia
announced
that
in
spite
of
it,
in
order
to
advance
the
art
of
television
and
to
open
up
more
competition,
it
would
go
into
the
uhf
and
it
had
to
pick
a
place.
the
place
that
it
picked
was
milwaukee.
at
this
time,
it
had
an
affiliation
contract
with
poller.
now,
what
is
an
affiliation
contract?
here
in
washington,
cbs
has
an
affiliation
contract
with
wtop
channel
9,
so
that
if
you
turn
on
to
channel
9,
you
will
either
get
some
local
program,
either
of
local
interest
or
local
news
or
within
certain
hours,
if
you
turn
it
on,
you
will
get
a
network
program;
a
network
program
which
goes
practically
over
the
united
states.
so
that
as
my
friend
said,
90%
of
the
people,
or
80%
of
the
people
can
see
it
if
they
wish,
they
can
flip
the
knob
and
look
at
an
nbc
program
or
they
can
flip
the
knob
again
and
look
at
an
abc
program.
they
can
flip
it
again
and
see
an
independent
local
television
program,
so
that
to
speak
about
monopoly
by
cbs
or
lack
of
competition
borders
on
the
absurdity.
you
all
must
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
you
have
your
choice,
cbs
has
about
a
third
of
the
affiliates,
nbc
has
similar,
abc
has
not
quite
as
much
as
the
other
two
combined
--
as
the
other
two
have.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
mutual
your
honor
is
only
in
radio.
it
doesn't
have
a
--
it
doesn't
have
a
tv
program.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
wish
i
could
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
we're
going
over
until
tomorrow.
i'll
have
the
figures
for
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
they're
pertinent
to
the
issues
here,
but
i
will
have
it.
now,
when
mr.
poller
made
his
affiliation
agreement
to
cbs,
this
was
a
uhf
station
he
was
building,
and
he
came
in
and
he
got
this
affiliation
agreement.
now
this
affiliation
agreement
under
the
rules
of
the
fcc
cannot
last
longer
than
two
years.
they
must
be
renewed
every
two
years,
so
that
every
two
years,
mr.
poller
knew
that
cbs
might
not
renew
his
affiliation
for
any
number
of
reasons.
either
the
operation
was
bad,
or
cbs
might
want
to
go
into
that
market
itself,
or
for
any
number
of
reasons.
now,
he
was
put
--
poller
was
put
on
notice
again
by
a
further
provision
in
the
affiliation
agreement
that
he
was
subject
to
having
his
agreement
of
affiliation
canceled
at
any
moment.
not
at
any
moment,
but
on
six
month's
notice
so
that
we
have
the
agreement
which
lasts
only
two
years
and
we
have
an
overriding
provision
that
cbs
might
at
anytime
on
six
month's
notice
cancel
this
affiliation.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
no
sir,
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
now,
mr.
poller
testified,
this
is
the
plaintiff
testifying,
that
he
looked
upon
this
whole
thing
with
a
great
deal
of
trepidation
that
he
was
spending
money
building
up
his
studio,
and
he
was
worried
about
this.
and
he
came
to
cbs
a
number
of
times
and
said,
“won't
you
give
me
either
the
usual
year's
cancellation
or
guarantee
that
i
will
be
able
to
subsist
for
two
years,
and
each
time
this
was
reviewed.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
there
are
some
that
have
six
months
as
my
friend
has
said.
the
usual
thing,
the
majority
is
to
provide
two
years
at
which
time
they
can
be
not
renewed
or
a
cancellation
on
one
year's
notice.
even
the
two-year
contracts
provide
that
if
they
are
not
cancelled
by
a
notice,
they
continue
indefinitely
so
that
even
the
two-year
contract
can
be
terminated
by
a
notice
saying
that
when
the
two
years
are
up,
don't
look
to
us
for
a
renewal.
now
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
at
that
time
sir,
i
have
the
figures
and
they're
in
the
record.
at
that
time,
there
were
386
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
stations
on
the
air.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
oh
in
milwaukee.
in
milwaukee
when
it
entered
into
the
affiliation,
there
was
--
there
were
two
uhf
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
and
one
vhf
which
had
been
there
some
four
years.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that
was
affiliated
with
nbc.
now
to
complete
that
picture
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
at
about
the
time
that
cbs
went
in
to
milwaukee,
a
second
vhf
appeared
on
the
scene
and
two
years
later
a
third
vhf
appeared
on
the
scene.
so
that
cbs
in
19
--
starting
in
1956
was
competing
single-handedly
against
three
affiliated
vhf
stations,
three
vhf
stations.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
two
of
which
were
affiliated.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
cbs
hasn't
acquired
the
third.
cbs,
the
so-called
“monopolist”,
was
forced
out
of
business
in
milwaukee
by
competition
from
vhf.
the
monopolist
was
forced
out
of
business
by
its
competition
in
milwaukee.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
after
it
was
forced
out
of
business,
this
monopolist
then
went
to
the
third
vhf
station
and
affiliated
with
the
third
vhf
station.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that
was
all
there
was
--
was
available.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes
sir.
now,
on
behalf
of
my
client,
i
wish
to
point
out
also
that
i
think
cbs
planned
in
there,
because
cbs
believed
in
uhf.
dr.
stanton
had
said
time
and
again
that
uhf
will
be
the
savior
of
the
tv
business
by
opening
up
many
more
channels
and
again,
with
(inaudible)
to
my
client
i
say,
it
went
in
there
in
order
to
prove
that
uhf
could
succeed.
it
did
not
prove
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
there
are
localities
where
conversions
have
been
made.
i
don't
--
i
don't
remember
that
figure
of
200
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
there
are
some
cities
your
honor
where
there
are
only
uhf
stations.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
and
in
such
cities
where
there
is
no
competition,
in
those
cities
where
there
is
no
such
competition,
uhf
can
survive.
now,
don't
take
my
word
for
it
your
honor
that
uhf
cannot
fight
vhf.
the
plaintiff
said
so
that
if
uhf
station
doesn't
have
an
affiliation,
it
cannot
survive.
and
it
says
so
very
dramatically,
and
it
is
the
very
foundation
of
the
case
here.
there
was
and
is
no
place
in
the
united
states
where
a
non-affiliated
uhf
station
could
or
can
operate,
and
survive
in
competition
with
stations
owned
by
or
having
affiliation
with
the
national
network.
at
no
time
material
to
this
action,
could
a
uhf
television
station
remain
in
existence
at
milwaukee
without
the
advantage
of
an
affiliation
with
cbs,
nbc
or
abc.
this
is
the
very
foundation
of
this
case.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
there
are
now
three
allocations
and
three
stations
on
the
air.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
allocations
have
been
there
for
many
years.
the
first
station
went
on
way
back
in
1947,
nbc
affiliate.
the
second
station
went
on
about
this
time
when
we
were
buying
uhf,
1954,
that
went
to
abc
as
an
affiliate.
then
the
third
one
came
on
two
years
later,
1956,
but
we
kept
on
competing
for
three
years
after
that
with
our
uhf
station
until
finally
we
had
to
succumb
and
we
went
to
the
vhf.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
we
had
three
sir
but
we
had
applications
for
two
others.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
other
--
well,
they
were
in
other
cities.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
new
york
and
san
francisco.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
five
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
right.
the
three
we
had
and
two
applications
we
had,
that's
five.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
right,
that's
right.
and
we
couldn't
have
bought
those
two
uhf
until
this
time,
1954,
when
the
fcc
said
we
will
let
networks
own
seven
stations
providing
only
five
can
be
vhf.
now,
what
is
the
complaint
here
your
honor?
the
complaint
is
two-fold;
first
that
we
carried
out
the
terms
of
our
agreement.
we
were
told
that
we
could
cancel
this
affiliation
at
any
time
within
six
months.
that's
what
we
did.
the
second
complaint
is
that
we
didn't
deal
with
poller.
we
dealt
with
bartell's.
now,
why
didn't
we
deal
with
poller?
poller
had
an
affiliation
and
he
wanted
to
sell
his
station.
there's
a
man
very
active
in
the
television
business
by
the
name
of
storer,
and
he
and
storer
began
to
negotiate,
this
station
that
poller
owned.
he
wanted
to
sell.
he
was
asking
for
$2
million
for
his
station,
$2
million.
bartell's
was
asking
for
one
sixth
of
that
amount,
$335,000.
cbs
decided
that
it
would
buy
a
station
for
$335,000
instead
of
$2
million
and
that
serves
as
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
here,
that
instead
of
going
to
poller
and
paying
him
$2
million,
we
went
to
bartell's
and
bought
it
for
one
sixth
as
much.
now
to
add
insult
to
injury,
because
we
think
it
was,
included
in
this
$2
million,
it's
conceded
that
his
equipment,
the
actual
physical
assets
were
worth
only
a
half
a
million,
that's
what
we
paid.
he
doesn't
contend
that
he
got
an
inadequate
price
for
that,
as
what
he
paid
for
they
told
us,
and
that's
what
we
paid
him;
one
half
of
million
dollars
plus
all
of
the
old
bartell
equipment
which
he
said
was
worth
$50,000,
a
figure
which
we
have
to
take
here
in
the
summary
judgment.
but
included
in
the
$2
million
figure
was
the
value
of
his
affiliation
with
cbs.
this
is
a
very
valuable
thing,
an
affiliation
with
a
network.
and
he
asked
for
$2
million,
although
the
physical
assets
were
worth
only
a
half
a
million,
because,
and
only
because,
he
had
an
affiliation
with
cbs.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
they
followed
the
determination
by
cbs
that
it
would
not
pay
$2
million
but
would
pay
$335,000.
now,
your
honors
are
familiar
with
many
cases
where
when
a
seller
knows
that
a
very
rich
entity
like
cbs
is
in
the
market
for
a
station;
that
the
price
goes
up.
there
was
nothing
unusual
perhaps
the
code
names
were
a
little
dramatic,
but
there's
nothing
unusual
in
a
company
sending
a
broker
which
is
what
holt
was,
sending
a
broker
out
to
get
an
option
on
a
piece
of
property,
and
not
telling
the
seller
who
the
purchaser
was.
now,
what
is
the
reason
for
that?
the
reason
for
it
is
to
keep
the
price
down.
this
is
done
your
honors
practically
everyday
in
the
real
estate
business.
the
man
wants
to
buy
a
piece
of
real
estate.
he
doesn't
let
the
seller
know
that
he's
assembling
a
big
plot,
and
therefore
shoot
your
price
up,
or
that
a
large
corporation
is
buying
his
plot
and
therefore,
shoot
your
price
up.
he
sends
a
broker
around
to
buy
this
as
cheaply
as
possible.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
does
uncle
sam
do
that
your
honor?
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
oh,
i
see.
uncle
sam
may
get
--
may
have
a
broker
buy
before
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
well,
if
uncle
sam
does
it,
it
must
be
good
business
practice.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
right.
[laughter]
that's
good
enough
or
if
the
united
states
is
good
enough
for
cbs,
point
of
phrase,
but
the
point
i
wish
to
make
sirs
is
that
there's
nothing
involving
section
1
or
section
2
here.
what
difference
does
it
make,
whether
we
let
bartell's
know?
bartell's
swears
he
didn't
know.
he
swears
that
he
was
so
thunderstruck
when
he
heard
it
was
cbs
to
whom
the
option
was
being
assigned
that
after
he
hung
up,
he
had
a
double
take
and
he
called,
hold
again
and
he
said,
“what
did
i
hear
you
say?
was
it
cbs
that
was
buying
this?”
now,
this
may
not
be
tactics
the
court
approves
off.
poller
doesn't
approve
of
them,
but
the
question
is
do
these
tactics
violate
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
or
section
2
of
the
sherman
act?
obviously,
they're
irrelevant,
those
sections.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
--
by
the
bartell
station.
and
we
were
discussing
the
irrelevance
of
all
of
the
secrecy
involved
in
so
far
as
any
antitrust
laws
are
concerned.
i
want
to
repeat
that
the
main
complaint
here,
what
the
plaintiff
is
expressing
a
grievance
about
is
that,
we
did
go
to
bartell's
to
buy
his
station
rather
than
to
come
to
him
to
pay
six
times
as
much
at
poller
station
and
that
what
he
is
complaining
of
is
an
antitrust
violation,
is
the
fact
that
we
cancelled,
that
we
cancelled
our
affiliation
agreement
with
him
in
accordance
with
the
very
terms
of
the
contract
which
he
signed,
giving
us
the
right
to
cancel
that
affiliation
on
six
months
notice.
now,
i
wish
to
take
up
the
irrelevance,
so
far
as
antitrust
laws
are
concerned
of
the
purchase
of
the
equipment
of
mr.
poller
about
which
mr.
wolf
spent
considerable
time
yesterday.
after
we
had
brought
bartell's
and
mr.
poller
realized
that
he
would
have
to
continue
as
unaffiliated
station,
he
came
to
new
york.
this
is
conceded
and
a
discussion
arose
about
the
purchase
of
his
equipment.
i
wish
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
it
was
not
the
purchase
of
his
station.
a
station
consists
of
physical
assets
plus
a
license,
a
studio,
some
broadcasting
facilities,
usually
in
the
form
of
a
teller.
the
important
thing
was
the
license
and
we
had
brought
from
bartell's,
his
license
and
equipment,
his
station
and
everything
that
went
with
it.
and
although
he's
attempted
to
inject
some
questions
of
fact
with
the
respect
of
his
purchase
of
the
equipment,
we
are
going
on
the
assumption
as
we
have
all
through
here
your
honors
that
the
plaintiff's
version
of
the
facts
is
the
correct
one.
and
he
claims
that
when
he
came
to
new
york,
we
knew
that
he
would
come
to
new
york
and
that
we
knew
that
he
would
offer
us
his
equipment.
now,
the
fact
is
that
so
far
as
antitrust
laws
are
concerned
and
by
that
i
mean,
section
1
or
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
purchase
of
this
equipment
are
wholly
immaterial.
in
our
view,
the
equipment
purchased
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
injury
to
mr.
poller
and
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
that
the
purchased
equipment
is
irrelevant
to
both.
you
will
recall
that
mr.
poller
raises
his
claim
on
the
fact
that
his
station
was
worth
$2
million
and
you
will
recall
that
he
claims
to
have
had
a
perspective
purchaser
in
the
form
of
a
mr.
storer
who
was
willing
to
pay
him
the
$2
million.
but,
it
is
conceded
that
that
offer
or
that
proposal
or
that
suggestion
of
$2
million
included
of
course,
the
continued
affiliation
to
cbs
because
mr.
storer
or
any
purchaser
buying
that
station
would
want
to
have
some
kind
of
assurance
that
this
affiliation
would
continue
so
that
when
we
were
being
asked,
or
it
was
suggested
or
we
had
to
contemplate
the
purchase
of
mr.
poller's
station
for
$2
million
rather
than
purchasing
bartell's,
we
would
be
in
effect
buying
back
our
own
affiliation.
although,
under
our
contractual
relationship
with
mr.
poller,
we
had
the
absolute
right
to
terminate
within
six
months,
so
that
in
addition
to
paying
six
times
as
much
as
we
would
have
to
bartell's,
we
would
in
effect
be
buying
back
our
own
affiliation
from
him
when
in
fact,
we
have
the
right
to
cancel
it
on
a
six
months
notice.
the
reason
i
say
that
the
equipment
purchase
was
irrelevant
to
his
claim
of
injury
was
that
if
we
have
not
voided,
if
we
have
merely
continued
with
bartell's,
mr.
poller
would
have
been
a
half
a
million
dollars
poorer
because
we
paid
him
that
for
his
equipment.
and
if
we
hadn't
paid
it
to
him,
he
would
have
suffered
substantially
greater
injury.
now,
there
wasn't
any
inadequacy
of
equipment
in
the
market.
there's
no
claim
here
that
there
was
any
restraint
in
the
business
of
television
equipment.
there
wasn't
anything
unique
about
this
equipment.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
page
20
of
the
record,
appears
a
statement
in
the
complaint
by
mr.
poller
to
the
effect
that
we
were
in
a
position,
cbs
was
in
a
position
adequately
to
equip
woky,
that's
bartell's,
and
to
transfer
its
programs
to
that
station,
so
that
it
isn't
even
claimed
that
there's
any
restraint
here
with
the
respect
to
television
station
equipment.
so
that,
it
can
have
no
effect
at
all
upon
the
question
as
to
whether
the
antitrust
laws
were
violated.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
page
20
of
the
record,
the
first
full
paragraph
and
the
second
full
paragraph
under
13,
roman
numeral
13.
and
there
can
be
no
questions
of
that.
there
was
plenty
of
equipment
at
the
market.
hundreds
of
tv
stations
were
being
equipped.
there's
no
restraint
at
all
in
the
question
of
equipment
and
this
is
wholly
immaterial,
not
only
to
his
injury
but
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
antitrust
laws
were
violated.
now,
after
mr.
storer
had
a
cheque
for
a
half-a-million
dollars,
after
mr.
poller
had
our
cheque
for
a
half-a-million
dollars
in
his
pocket.
he
began
to
ruminate
as
to
whether
he
had
some
cause
of
action
against
us.
and
it
took
him18
months
to
find
a
cause
of
action
or
what
he
thinks
as
a
cause
of
action.
and
after
18
months,
he
started
this
antitrust
action
against
us,
claiming
damages,
three-fold
and
damages
were
$2
million
which
he
claimed
was
the
value
of
the
station,
minus
the
$50,000
which
he
had
received
which
was
the
value
that
he
put
upon
the
bartell's
equipment,
and
he
multiplies
that
by
three.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
yes
sir,
like
--
sorry,
in
fact
$500,000.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
plus
$50,000
as
the
value
the
second-hand
equipment
and
he
multiplied
the
difference
of
a
million
450
by
three.
and
this
is
the
action
which
he
decided
to
bring
against
us,
18
months
after
the
close
of
this
transaction.
and
although
his
grievance
is
solely
that
we
refused
to
deal
with
him
and
canceled
his
affiliation
agreement,
he
has
hung
onto
this
claim,
a
mass
of
antitrust
theories
which
it
is
our
contention
of
which
it
is
our
contention,
none
can
be
sustained
even
assuming
the
facts
that
mr.
poller
recites
as
the
basis
of
antitrust.
and
we
have
to
consider
of
course,
was
section
2
violated,
what
section
1
violated.
and
turning
to
section
2
and
in
all
of
this
consideration
taking
the
facts
alleged
by
mr.
poller
to
be
true,
the
first
thing
we
have
to
do
to
see
whether
section
2
was
violated,
whether
as
judge
whittaker
asked,
what
is
the
relevant
market
here?
what
market
was
monopolized?
and
although
in
the
course
of
this
litigation
on
its
way
up
to
this
bench,
there
have
been
changes
in
what
the
claimed
relevant
market
is.
we
have
it
fixed
in
this
court
at
least
that
the
claim
is
that
the
relevant
market
which
we
monopolized
was
the
uhf
market
in
milwaukee
because
he
says
there
were
formally
two
uhf
stations.
and
now,
after
we
had
bought
bartell's
and
poller
had
quit
broadcasting,
there
was
only
one.
now,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
very
definition
urged
by
poller
as
to
what
the
relevant
market
here
is,
defeats
his
very
claim
because
it
is
a
matter
of
which
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice,
and
it
has
been
taking
judicial
notice
of
in
many
cases
in
the
circuit
court.
at
this
uhf
station
of
cbs's
in
milwaukee,
was
competing
first
with
two
vhf
stations
and
ultimately
with
three.
and
if
there
is
any
validity
to
the
test
applied
in
the
cellophane
and
other
cases
to
the
effect
that
you
must
in
a
market
consider
competing
goods
readily
acceptable
substitutes.
it
is
quite
clear
that
there
cannot
be
the
relevant
market
of
uhf
because
in
milwaukee,
and
wherever
there
was
a
uhf
station,
uhf
was
competing
and
competing
on
very
disadvantageous
terms
with
vhf.
so
that
right
in
milwaukee,
persons
who
were
listening
to
television
had
the
choice
of
flipping
their
dial
to
look
at
two
vhfs
and
later
three
vhfs
or
flipping
the
dial
to
the
uhf
station
which
cbs
owned
in
milwaukee,
so
that
as
a
result,
there
was
this
intense
competition
between
the
one
uhf
station,
which
we
were
operating.
and
the
two
and
then
three
vhf
stations
which
were
operating
two
of
them
with
a
network
affiliation
and
one
independently,
so
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
relevant
market
could
not
have
been
uhf
in
milwaukee.
and
if
you
try
to
find
a
relevant
market
in
which
it
can
reasonably
be
urged
that
cbs
was
a
monopolist,
such
market
cannot
be
found
and
in
our
brief,
we
discussed
one
after
the
other
because
wherever
you
go
in
the
united
states
to
look
at
television,
you
find
intense
competition
among
the
three
networks
and
in
addition
to
the
three
networks,
you'll
find
a
number
of
independent
television
stations.
so
that
although,
we
may
have
in
the
united
states
a
triopoly
of
the
three
networks
in
competition
with
each
other,
and
in
competition
with
independent
television
stations.
we
do
not
have
the
situation
which
is
contemplated
in
section
2
of
a
monopoly
in
any
market.
take
for
example,
the
relevant
market
of
all
television,
of
all
television
in
milwaukee,
obviously
there
was
competition
there.
take
the
possible
relevant
market
of
television
nationally,
there
was
obviously
fierce
competition
and
there
has
been
an
always
“will
be”
between
the
three
networks.
the
federal
communications
commission
is
very
sensitive
about
this.
and
under
the
present
set
up
of
its
regulations,
i
venture
the
opinion
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
a
monopoly
the
way
the
fcc
runs
a
statute,
a
monopoly
of
any
particular
station,
in
any
particular
market
in
the
united
states.
and
if
we
were
a
monopolist
in
milwaukee,
i
repeat
that
we
were
the
only
monopolist
in
the
history
of
the
administration
of
the
antitrust
laws,
which
was
forced
out
of
business
by
its
competitors.
what
kind
of
a
monopolist
is
that?
because,
we
had
to
give
up
the
ghost
after
four
years
of
operation
to
our
competitors
and
to
say
that
in
spite
of
that,
during
these
four
years
of
struggle,
we
were
a
monopolist,
seems
to
make
a
mockery
of
section
2.
now,
turning
to
section
1,
the
question
of
an
unreasonable
restrain,
the
contention
there
as
i
take
it
is,
that
there
was
a
restraint
and
a
restraint
only
in
milwaukee
because
of
the
reduction
of
the
number
of
stations.
we
have
urged
and
the
court
below
has
found
that
there
was
no
restraint
and
that
this
what
happened
in
milwaukee
was
only
an
extension
or
perhaps
a
repetition
of
what
has
happened
in
so
many
areas
in
which
the
rule
of
united
states
against
colgate
has
been
applied
to
the
effect
and
in
the
absence
of
any
horizontal
arrangements
or
conspiracies
with
others
or
concerted
the
refusals
to
sell
such
as
in
the
times-picayune
case
or
parke-davis
case
and
in
the
absence
of
those
circumstances.
every
man
has
the
right
to
pick
the
customers
with
whom
he
will
do
business,
and
this
has
been
perhaps
typified
most
strongly
in
the
automobile
cases
in
which
automobile
manufacturers
picked
an
exclusive
agent
in
certain
territories
to
sell
their
own
cars.
and
it
has
been
held
time
again
and
those
cases
have
come
to
this
court
and
it
has
been
held
time
and
again
that
although
there
is
a
great
disparity
of
bargaining
power
between
general
motors
for
example
and
its
exclusive
dealers,
that
although
there
is
this
great
disparity
of
power,
that
is
not
tantamount
to
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
that
there
is
no
unreasonable
restraint
involved
if
a
dealership
is
terminated
within
the
meaning
of
section
1.
and
the
congress
agrees
of
course
with
this
because
your
honors
will
recall
that
when
complaints
were
filed
with
the
congress,
with
the
respect
to
the
sometimes
cruel
methods
which
automobile
manufacturers
used
with
their
dealers,
and
when
it
was
firmly
established
as
a
principle
of
law,
that
no
remedy
could
be
found
pursuant
to
the
antitrust
laws
that
the
congress
passed
the
statute
known
as
the
“dealer's
day
in
court
act”
under
which,
the
dealers
were
given
some
protection
from
the
superior
bargaining
power
of
the
manufacturers.
but,
the
point
is
that
that
action
was
taken
by
congress
as
it
said
to
supplement
the
antitrust
laws
because
the
antitrust
laws
did
not
cover
that
situation.
now,
the
colgate
rule
has
been
applied
to
broadcast
in
a
case
which
came
up
from
the
circuit
court
and
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court.
it
was
held
in
federal
broadcasting
against
abc,
that
the
rule
that
a
man
can
deal
with
the
customer
that
he
picks
can
be
applied
to
the
selection
of
an
affiliate.
and
this
is
quite
natural
because
in
many
ways,
the
affiliation
contract
is
very
similar
to
the
dealer
cases
because
what
cbs
does
when
it
comes
for
example
to
wtop
here
in
washington
is
to
say,
“we
would
like
to
present
our
programs
through
you,
and
we
will
pay
you
a
certain
amount
per
hour
if
you
will
present
our
programs
in
your
locality
and
it
does
that
with
some
200
stations
through
the
united
states.”
now,
what
happened
here
was
that
although,
we
had
that
affiliation
with
mr.
poller
that
we
had
the
right
under
the
colgate
rule
without
violating
section
1
to
say
to
mr.
poller,
“we
have
decided
to
terminate
your
agreement
which
was
our
right
on
the
contract
and
to
make
a
new
affiliation
agreement
with
someone
else
or
to
buy
a
station.”
and
so
far
as
the
antitrust
laws
are
concerned,
it
made
no
difference
to
poller.
there
was
no
greater
impact
upon
poller
whether
we
merely
switched
his
affiliation
or
whether
we
terminated
his
affiliation
and
bought
a
station.
so
that
the
restraint
which
is
alleged
here
namely
that
in
some
way
cbs
was
responsible
for
reducing
the
number
of
stations
in
milwaukee
cannot
be
sustained
and
is
refuted
by
mr.
poller's
allegations
himself.
i
read
to
your
honors
yesterday
from
his
complaint
in
which
he
said
that
an
unaffiliated
uhf
station
could
not
survive
in
a
mixed
market.
this
was
the
basis
of
his
complaint.
and
we
accept
that
for
purposes
--
certainly
for
purposes
of
summary
judgment.
we
accept
that
and
we
say
that
therefore
the
fact
that
the
number
of
markets,
the
number
of
outlets,
the
number
of
uhf
stations
in
milwaukee
rather
was
reduced
from
two
to
one,
was
a
matter
of
inevitability
according
to
his
own
allegations.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
we
think
it
does
sir.
we
think
that
that
is
the
fundamental
question
whether
we
had
the
right
under
our
contract
to
terminate
this
affiliation,
whether
we
had
the
right
to
pick
our
own
customers
as
we
have
in
every
market.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
right.
this
is
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
sir
and
is
the
basis
of
mr.
poller's
action
and
we
accept
that
for
purposes
of
summary
judgment.
but,
if
it
be
not
true,
if
it
be
not
true,
still
cbs
cannot
be
blamed
for
the
reduction
from
two
to
one
because
it
was
up
to
mr.
poller
to
continue
in
business
if
he
wanted
to,
and
mr.
poller
made
the
choice
not
to
continue
in
business.
he
had
the
equipment.
he
had
all
of
bartell's
equipment
which
we
gave
him.
he
had
our
check
for
half-a-million
dollars.
he
could've
continued
operating
the
same
as
bartell's
did.
bartell's
operated
for
some
time
in
competition
with
vhf
so
that
cbs
cannot
be
blamed
for
that
reduction.
either
it
was
inevitable
as
poller
claims
because
we
had
terminated
his
affiliation
or
if
it
was
not
inevitable
then
it
was
mr.
poller's
decision
to
go
out
of
business
although
he
had
all
of
the
equipment
which
enabled
him
--
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
continue
in
business.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
quite
obviously,
mr.
poller
didn't
want
to
assume
the
obligations
of
that
lease.
now,
whether
this
meant
that
he
had
in
his
mind
not
to
continue
in
business
in
spite
of
his
representation
that
he
would,
we
do
not
know.
but
irrespective
of
that,
we
were
giving
him
the
opportunity
to
continue
in
business.
he
apparently
referred
to
assume
that
he
couldn't
compete
as
the
alleged
in
this
complaint.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
no
sir.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
the
record
shows
because
it's
in
the
moving
affidavit
here
and
not
denied
that
he
represented
to
the
commission
on
page
52
that
he
represented
to
the
commission
that
he
was
going
to
continue
in
business.
now,
whether
he
wanted
to
continue
in
business
in
some
other
location
and
did
not
want
this
lease
or
whether
he
didn't
want
to
assume
the
obligations
right
away
of
this
lease,
we
do
not
know
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned.
and
i
urge
sir,
that
it's
immaterial.
he
had
the
equipment.
there's
no
allegation,
there's
no
claim
at
all
that
studios
were
unavailable,
that
a
place
was
unavailable
for
him
to
maintain
a
studio.
he
represented
he
was
going
to
continue
and
we
say
that
the
fact
that
he
didn't
continue
can
be
laid
either
to
the
inevitability
of
noncompetitive
equality
with
vhf
or
with
the
fact
that
poller
just
decided
that
he
would
keep
our
check
and
not
continue
in
business.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
assume
that
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan.
let's
assume
that
we
said,
let's
take
this
out,
what
difference
this
is,
although
there
is
no
evidence
for
that
at
all
either
in
his
affidavit
or
any
place
else.
let
us
assume
that
he
could
show
that
at
trial.
what
difference
would
that
make?
he
has
taken
the
position
that
he
never
could
compete
with
an
unaffiliated
uhf
station.
and
as
i
say,
if
he's
wrong
he
decided
in
any
event
that
he
wasn't
going
to
compete
and
this
decision
was
his,
so
that
with
either
prong,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
cannot
legitimately
and
justifiably
blame
cbs
for
the
fact
that
one
uhf
station
went
off
the
air.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
well
it
was
neither
of
us.
it
was
mr.
wolf's
client.
it
was
the
complaint
which
alleged
that.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
what
i
read
to
your
honors
yesterday
was
from
the
complaint.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
and
that
is
the
foundation
of
his
case
and
he
says,
“as
soon
as
we
terminated,
the
economic
damage
was
done
to
him
because
the
fact
is
and
we
knew
it,
that
he
could
not
compete
with
a
nonaffiliated
uhf
station.”
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
well,
we're
willing
to
take
his
statement.
it's
a
fact
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
it's
a
fact
that
he
alleges.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
and
we're
willing
to
take
that
statement
that
he
could
not
compete
and
we
say
that
if
in
spite
of
that
statement
that
he
could
not
compete,
we
still
had
the
right
to
choose
our
customer
that
there
was
no
obligation
on
our
part
to
treat
only
with
poller,
and
nobody
else
because
if
that
were
the
law,
poller
himself
would
be
in
restraint
of
trade.
if
he
said
we
could
not
go
out
and
transfer
our
affiliation
without
buying
a
station
for
example
that
we
had
to
keep
our
affiliation
with
poller,
even
though
our
contract
with
poller
gave
us
the
right
to
terminate.
if
he
contends
that
in
spite
of
that,
we
could
not
change
the
affiliation,
then
he
really
is
acting
in
the
restraint
of
trade
saying
that
for
all
time,
we
have
to
continue
our
relations
with
poller
no
matter
what
comes.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
we
think
sir,
that
so
far
as
poller
is
concerned
the
private
litigant
here
seeking
to
recover
treble
damages,
there
is
no
difference
in
the
injury
to
him
whether
we
buy
a
station
or
merely
transfer
the
affiliation.
there
maybe
some
question
for
the
attorney
general
to
rise
about
station
ownership.
this
is
something
which
poller
has
nothing
to
do
with.
poller's
concern
is
solely,
“where
is
the
impact
upon
me?”
and
poller
says,
and
it's
true
that
the
impact
upon
him,
the
treble
damage
seeker.
and
this
court
has
said
that
you
cannot
get
the
windfall
of
treble
damages
because
they're
restraints
some
place
else,
if
there
are
restraints
which
we
don't
concede,
but
so
far
as
poller
was
concerned,
he
has
argued
and
he
still
argues
that
his
damage
occurred
when
we
terminated
that
affiliation
agreement.
and
whatever
happened
afterwards
is
wholly
immaterial.
it
made
no
difference
to
poller
whether
we
own
the
station
to
which
we
transferred
the
affiliation
so
to
speak
or
whether
we
had
left
him
and
affiliated
with
one
of
the
vhf
stations.
he
says
and
we
accept
it
the
purposes
of
this
judgment,
summary
judgment
that
the
damage
occurred
--
the
economic
damaged
occurred
to
poller
when
his
station
affiliation
was
terminated.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
as
i
understood
the
chief
justice,
there
were
two
things,
first
the
ownership
and
then
the
affiliation
in
spite
of
the
expectation
assuming
that
there
was
this
expectation.
there
was
also
poller's
testimony
that
he
had
signed
this
agreement
giving
us
the
six
months
right
to
terminate.
and
also
the
fact
that
he
felt
some
trepidation
about
that,
that
he
wanted
some
assurance
from
us
that
we
would
continue
this
affiliation.
and
we
refused
to
give
it
to
him
for
a
number
of
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
this
was
a
trial
period
of
six
months.
and
the
second
place,
this
was
a
uhf
station,
which
was
untried
to
a
great
extent,
and
we
had
declined
the
change
that
six
months
termination.
the
question
is
did
we
have
the
right
to
carry
out
our
contract
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he,
in
the
face
of
a
refusal
on
our
part
to
do
anything
about
extending
it,
was
willing
to
invest
in
a
studio.
now,
right
here
in
washington,
wtop
has
built
up
a
great
station
in
the
expectation.
it
only
has
a
two
years
affiliation.
it
only
has
a
two
years
affiliation
with
cbs
and
it
can
be
terminated
within
six
months
of
the
termination
date.
it
has
a
great
station
here
in
washington.
we
have
the
right
to
terminate
that
affiliation
with
that
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
would
say
as
a
practical
matter,
it
might
perhaps
get
the
affiliation
of
another
network
or
it
could
operate
as
channel
5
does
in
washington
without
an
affiliation
and
perhaps
do
very
well
because
it
has
built
up
a
great
station.
poller
refused
to
take
that
chance
because
it
was
a
uhf
station
and
he
didn't
want
to
go
ahead.
now,
your
honors,
this
may
appear
as
a
cruel
thing
to
do.
i
finished
this
one
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
this
may
appear
as
a
cruel
thing
to
do.
only
once
in
mr.
wolf's
argument
that
he
state,
in
my
opinion,
an
accurate
statement
of
the
antitrust
law
situation
here
and
that
was
that
the
antitrust
laws
were
not
intended
to
take
care
of
cruelty
in
business
and
this
is
true.
now,
we
don't
admit
that
we
were
cruel.
we
claim
that
if
there
was
a
trial,
we
could
show
that
there
wasn't
but
take
his
statement
as
we
must
for
summary
judgment
that
this
was
a
cruel
thing
for
cbs
to
do,
to
pay
$335,000
instead
of
two
million,
assume
that,
assume
the
truth
of
it.
we've
tried
to
assume
the
truth
of
everyone
of
his
allegation.
if
this
were
cruel
even
if
it
weren't
unethical,
and
even
as
judge
washington
said
if
it
were
unfair,
still
section
1
and
section
2
of
the
antitrust
laws
neither
of
those
is
the
remedy.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
we
think
that
that
statement
is
wholly
justified
that
every
material
statement
of
fact
alleged
by
the
plaintiff
has
been
conceded
by
us
in
our
briefs
in
making
this
summary
motion.
obviously,
we
couldn't
make
this
motion
for
summary
judgment
unless
we
were
willing
and
ready
to
do
that
and
we
do
it.
and
when
your
honors
come
to
read
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
we
did
it
below,
we
do
it
here.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
think,
but
--
yes.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
and
we
did
that
below
your
honors
and
we
did
it
in
a
district
court.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that's
right
and
we
did
it
in
the
circuit
court
and
we
do
it
here.
the
thing
that
are
important
is
distinguished
between
the
material
allegations
of
fact.
for
example,
was
there
secrecy,
did
holt
know?
those
things
are
immaterial.
i
haven't
gone
into
those
because
my
time
has
expired
but
we
alleged
that
there
was
no
reason
--
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
think
there
is
a
controversy
which
is
a
matter
of
law
as
to
whether
its
material
for
example,
to
pick
one
item,
did
holt
know
when
he
went
to
milwaukee
that
what
he
was
going
to
do,
if
he
were
successful
would
hurt
poller?
there
maybe
some
dispute
about
that.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
i
don't
think
(voice
overlap)
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
we're
willing
to
assume
that
holt
did
know.
we
assumed
that.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
we
assumed
that
holt
did
know.
we
say
that
that's
immaterial,
so
--
and
has
no
meaning
so
far
as
the
consideration
of
antitrust
laws
are
concerned.
so
that
wherever
there
is
a
dispute,
we
are
willing
to
wave
the
dispute
and
have
waved
the
dispute,
and
did
below
saying
that
the
allegations
that
he
alleges
all
of
them,
we
assume
are
true.
we
urge
that
a
great
many
of
them
had
no
materiality
to
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
sir
and
i
think
that
must
be,
that
must
be
the
rule
in
every
summary
judgment
motion
and
that
is
our
position.
as
your
honor,
you
asked
me
question
if
you
want
those
figures
i
have
them.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
your
honor,
asked
me
to
find
the
figures
of
uhf
affiliation
among
with
the
three
networks.
mr.
samuel
i.
rosenman
and
i
have
found
those
figures
as
of
november
10th.
cbs
has
23
uhf
affiliates
of
which
number
16
are
in
markets
where
all
of
the
outlets
are
uhf
and
seven
are
mixed
markets.
nbc
has
14
uhf
affiliates
of
which
nine
are
in
an
exclusively
uhf
market,
and
five
are
in
mixed
markets.
abc
has
18
uhf
affiliates
of
which
16
are
in
all
uhf
markets.
they
had
22
altogether
of
which
16
are
in
all
uhf
markets
and
six
are
in
mixed
markets.
