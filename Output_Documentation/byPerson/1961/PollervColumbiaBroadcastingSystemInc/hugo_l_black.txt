how
many
openings
were
there
in
vhf
in
milwaukee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you
said
that
there
were
three
allocations
from
the
milwaukee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
long
is
that
allocation
been
in
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
have
some
question
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
of
you
have
kept
constantly
referring
to
questions
of
fact.
frequently,
the
parties
will
agree
on
the
fact
but
they
do
not
agree
on
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
facts.
i
find
running
all
through
judge
miller's
opinion,
inferences
drawn
from
the
facts
as
he
saw
them.
for
instance,
he
says
that
the
equipment
bought
about
by
his
own
active
investing
too
heavily
in
the
equipment
without
having
a
firm
network
affiliation.
he
reaches
that
conclusion
of
inferences.
he
reaches
a
conclusion
that
if
he
thought
that
bartell
and
holt
combined
with
cbs
to
accomplish
a
common
purpose,
it
does
not
seem
to
us
that
the
purpose
was
to
restraint
trade
of
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
several
others,
i'm
calling
your
attention
to
this
to
find
out
if
you
are
saying
that
even
though
both
sides
agree
on
what
has
actually
occurred,
you
have
a
right
to
have
the
jury
test
on
what
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
there,
when
there
are
two
inferences
either
one
of
which
might
have
been
drawn.
justice
hugo
l.
black
somebody
has
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
somebody
has
to
conclude
from
the
facts
that
are
introduced.
so
you're
saying
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
not
required
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
to
go
fully
in
your
facts,
show
them
all.
but
if
there's
enough
facts
there
from
which
a
jury
could
reason
â€“
if
somebody
must
drawn
an
inference
--
which
affects
the
validity
of
the
charge
that's
for
the
jury
and
not
the
judge
under
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
findings
of
the
court
if
their
proper
finding,
find
--
on
what
are
the
inferences
from
the
evidence,
do
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wasn't
trying
to
get
into
that,
i
was
just
--
what
has
been
stated,
facts
can
be
used
in
the
rare
lose
fashion.
facts
and
many
types
of
cases,
knowing
what
the
facts
are,
it
does
not
constitute
enough
to
decide
the
case,
inferences
must
be
drawn
from
those
facts
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
want
to
get
in
to
the
difference
between
conclusions
of
facts
and
conclusions
of
law.
you
try
a
negligence
case,
same
fact.
frequently,
it
said
one
inference
could
be
drawn
on
another,
inference
could
be
drawn
as
for
the
jury,
is
that
a
