may
i
ask
you
mr.
wolf?
were
there
any
conditions
on
that
covenant
respecting

other
than
time?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
none
at
all?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
this
affiliated
if
i
may
ask
you
please,
was
it
affiliated
with
one
of
the
lead
chain?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no
affiliation.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
any
allegation
that
the
station
of
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no
the
other
one.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
any
allegations
that
bartell
knew
that
both
was
acting
for
cbs?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
word
station
does
not
include
license.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
does
not.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
under
the
bartell
license?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
was
as
i
understand
it
that
this
equipment
is
from
the
bartell's
station?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
bartell
(inaudible)
bartell
said
they've
been
doing
in
longer
or
shorter
time?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
can
tell
that
the
relevant
market
was
uhf
or
television?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
one
more
question
if
i
may
please.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
this
left
only
one
vhf
station
companies
but
you
mean
two,
have
you
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
left
only
one
uhf?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what's
happened
mutual,
is
it
gone?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
sir?
then
in
that
view
does
not
this
whole
case
come
down
to
the
question
whether
in
the
circumstances
alleged,
you
had
the
right
unilaterally
to
terminate
the
affiliation
agreement?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
for
the
allegation
is
that
without
the
affiliation,
the
station
could
not
succeed.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
just
any
--
just
any
fact
mr.
wolf,
do
you
mean
just
any
fact?
as
i
understand
the
rule,
there
must
be
a
genuine
issue
of
some
materials.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
here
quite
differently
from
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
test
the
sufficiency
as
by
the
(inaudible).
the
court
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
has
some
power
upon
the
pleadings
affidavits
and
record
on
file
to
determine
the
materiality
of
some
facts,
doesn't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
to
say
then
that
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
serves
only
the
office
of
the
demurer?
