mr.
morris
wolf
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
to
the
supreme
court
for
the
second
time
the
dangers
that
are
inherent
in
permitting
the
three
great
television
networks
to
acquire
and
operate
in
a
proprietary
capacity,
stations
of
their
own
at
the
same
time
that
they
supply
programs
to
affiliated
stations
in
something
akin
to
in
agency
capacity.
in
national
broadcasting
company
against
the
united
states
from
which
the
phrase
‘in
a
proprietary
capacity'
and
‘in
something
akin
to
an
agency
capacity'
is
quoted,
this
court
and
its
opinion
by
justice
frankfurter
upheld
the
fcc
limitations
on
the
location
of
radio
stations
which
the
networks
might
own,
and
quoted
from
the
fcc
report
that
the
common
ownership
of
network
and
station
places
the
network
in
a
position
where
its
interest
as
the
owner
of
certain
stations
may
conflict
with
its
interest
as
a
network
organization
serving
affiliated
stations.
this
was
similar
to
the
condition
which
existed
in
the
motion
picture
industry
until
this
court
in
united
states
against
paramount
forbad
producers
of
pictures
to
operate
theaters.
the
first
case
that
came
up,
which
this
danger
had
foreseen
was
u.s.
against
rca
where
nbc
wanted
a
station
of
its
own
in
philadelphia.
it
threatened
its
affiliate
westinghouse,
that
if
it
didn't
sell
westinghouse's
philadelphia
station
to
nbc,
nbc
would
cancel
or
refuse
to
renew
westinghouse's
affiliation.
you
held,
as
we
all
know,
that
the
antitrust
aspect
of
nbc's
action
was
not
washed
out
by
fcc's
approval
of
the
deal.
the
same
thing
has
happened
in
this
case.
this
time,
cbs
is
the
actor,
and
it
has
used
its
leverage
as
a
network,
the
phrase
used
by
the
chief
justice
in
u.s.
against
rca
on
a
much
smaller
affiliate
than
westinghouse,
and
with
much
more
devastating
anti-competitive
results
than
in
the
westinghouse
case.
the
third
instance
of
the
same
thing
is
involved
in
the
pending
suit
which
the
chronicle
publishing
company
of
san
francisco,
another
affiliate
of
nbc,
has
brought
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
against
nbc
for
using
similar
tactics
to
compel
that
plaintiff
to
sell
its
television
station
in
san
francisco
to
nbc.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
would
like
to
--
i'm
just
going
to
give
you
the
facts
of
the
case
if
i
may.
this
is
an
appeal
by
poller
from
the
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
of
an
order
of
judge
holtzoff,
granting
the
defendant's
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
dismissing
poller's
complaint
with
courses.
judge
washington
dissented
from
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
made
by
chief
judge
wilbur
k.
miller
and
judge
prettyman,
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
action
was
brought
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
for
damages
sustained
by
poller
as
the
assignee
of
the
midwest
broadcasting
company
by
reason
of
the
violation
by
the
defendants,
columbia
and
others
of
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
the
alleged
conspiracy,
the
violation
alleged
was
a
conspiracy
among
the
defendants
to
reduce
competition
and
hence
restrain
trade
in
the
television
broadcasting
industry
in
milwaukee
and
to
attempt
to
monopolize
that
trade
as
far
as
it
concerns
ultra
frequency
broadcasting
in
milwaukee
and
throughout
the
united
states.
the
natural
and
intended
result
of
the
conspiracy
as
we
claim
was
to
force
poller
to
sell
his
television
station
to
cbs
at
a
distressed
figure
far
below
its
real
value,
and
this
action
is
to
recover
the
resulting
damage.
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
opinion
by
judge
miller,
accepted
as
true,
all
the
exculpatory
testimony
of
the
defendants
in
their
pre-trial
affidavits
and
deposition
and
on
that
basis
found
as
facts
that
there
was
no
conspiracy,
no
restraint
of
trade,
no
monopolization
or
attempt
to
monopolize.
“hence,”
he
said,
“such
injury
as
poller
sustained
resulted
from
his
own
foolishness
in
investing
so
much
money
in
his
station
when
he
had
only
an
affiliation
agreement
with
cbs
which
it
cancelled
in
the
exercise
of
its
legal
rights
so
to
do.”
judge
washington
dissented
on
the
ground
that
poller
raised
genuine
issues
of
material
fact
as
to
whether
there
was
a
conspiracy
against
him
in
restraint
of
trade
and
the
monopoly,
and
that
poller
should
have
a
chance
to
have
these
questions
of
fact
decided
by
a
jury
particularly
where
he
said,
as
here,
“it
is
charged
that
the
public
has
been
deprived
of
maximum
television
service
by
a
reduction
of
competition.”
he
pointed
out
that
cbs's
freedom
to
select
its
customers
did
not
sanction
what
amounts
to
a
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade
and
the
monopoly.
of
course,
i
realize
that
even
if
we
win
our
battle
in
this
court,
we
have
not
won
the
war.
i
do
not
at
all
underestimate
the
skill
of
our
opponents,
but
we
shall
gain
all
that
we
have
a
right
to
ask,
an
opportunity
to
present
our
full
case
to
a
jury
to
decide.
in
order
to
reduce
the
questions
of
fact,
which
we
claim
and
which
judge
washington
thought
were
raised,
we
must
recite
the
transactions
which
resulted
in
the
injury
to
poller.
in
february
1953,
midwest
broadcasting
company,
i
think
i
--
it
will
be
less
confusing
if
i
speak
of
that
company
as
poller
because
he
became
the
assignee
of
all
of
its
rights
at
the
end
of
1955.
midwest
broadcasting
company
which
had
been
operating
a
radio
station
in
milwaukee
was
granted
by
fcc
a
permit
for
one
of
the
three
ultra-high
frequency
channels
which
fcc
assigned
to
milwaukee
when
fcc
felt
that
it
had
opened
a
large
number
of
new
channels
to
ultra-high
frequency
broadcasting
in
order,
as
it
said,
to
establish
a
truly
nationwide
and
competitive
television
system
because
the
previously
12
available
very
high
frequency
channels
were
so
completely
occupied
that
there
was
no
room
in
them
for
further
development.
from
the
commercial
point
of
view,
these
vhf
channels
were
preempted
almost
exclusively
by
the
three
great
networks
and
their
affiliates.
by
1954,
cbs,
nbc
and
abc
had
affiliations
with
90%
of
the
operating
stations
in
the
united
states,
cbs
itself
with
202
of
these
stations.
these
202
stations
served
90%
of
the
population
of
the
united
states.
the
development
of
ultra-high
frequency
broadcasting
was
difficult
because
no
receiving
sets
then
in
the
hands
of
the
public
could
get
uhf
programs
unless
the
owners
attached
converters
which
cost
about
$20
each,
and
it
was
a
problem
to
get
the
set
owners
to
make
this
investment.
poller,
however,
when
he
got
his
permission,
had
faith
in
his
ability
to
solve
this
problem.
he
built
his
station
in
milwaukee
with
the
call
letters
wcan-tv
and
in
september
1953,
he
entered
into
an
affiliation
agreement
with
cbs-tv
which
at
that
time
had
no
primary
affiliation
in
milwaukee
and
was
very
eager
to
affiliate
with
poller.
this
was
because,
as
the
deposition
show,
cbs
considered
him
a
very
promotion
minded,
sales
minded,
aggressive
station
operator.
as
i
am
sure
you
know,
an
affiliation
agreement
is
an
arrangement
with
one
of
the
three
national
networks
under
which
the
network
agrees
to
furnish
programs
to
a
local
broadcasting
station
in
return
for
which
the
local
station
must
show
at
specified
hours,
programs
and
advertisements
which
the
network
have
agreed
with
national
advertisers,
shall
be
shown
in
their
self-owned
and
affiliated
stations.
the
poller
agreement
ran
for
two
years.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
morris
wolf
yes.
mr.
morris
wolf
yes.
that
isn't
involved
in
this
case
however.
it
since
has
been
abrogated
as
you
know.
the
power
of
agreement
ran
for
two
years
but
it
gave
cbs-tv
the
unilateral
right
to
cancel
it
at
anytime
with
six
months
notice.
cbs's
high
opinion
of
poller's
ability
was
justified
for
poller
had
unexpectedly
good
results
in
getting
thousands
of
tv
owners
in
the
milwaukee
area
to
convert
so
that
they
could
see
uhf
programs,
and
cbs
was
highly
complementary
of
its
progress.
in
the
meanwhile,
bartell's
--
mr.
morris
wolf
none
at
all.
mr.
morris
wolf
none
at
all.
in
the
meanwhile
bartell's,
who
operated
in
other
radio
station
in
milwaukee
had
obtained
a
second
uhf
permit
with
call
letters
woky.
those
are
the
only
letters
i'll
ask
you
to
remember
because
they're
so
confusing.
there
are
so
many.
bartell's
equipment
was
poor,
and
salant,
the
vice
president
of
cbs
testified
about
it
in
most
uncomplimentary
terms.
bartell's
did
not
do
well
with
woky.
at
the
end
of
1953
--
mr.
morris
wolf
uhf,
this
was
the
second
uhf
station
--
mr.
morris
wolf
--
in
--
this
was
the
competitor
of
poller
station.
mr.
morris
wolf
no.
he
was
not.
he
had
no
affiliation.
mr.
morris
wolf
woky
had
no
affiliation.
it
was
an
independent
station.
at
the
end
of
1953,
fcc
in
order
to
encourage
the
use
of
ultra-high
frequency
stations
announced
that
it
was
considering
a
rule
to
allow
any
of
its
licensees
to
own
two
uhf
stations
in
addition
to
the
five
vh
stations
which
they
previously
had
been
permitted
to
own.
cbs
at
that
time
owned
three
extremely
profitable
vhf
stations
in
the
key
cities
of
new
york,
los
angeles
and
chicago,
and
had
applications
pending
for
the
two
more
vhf
stations
which
it
was
permitted
to
have.
as
soon
as
the
uhf
matter
became
to
be
agitated,
cbs
began
looking
into
the
situation
and
decided
that
if
it
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
the
uhf
channels,
one
of
the
two
most
desirable
markets
in
the
united
states
to
do
so
was
milwaukee,
which
had
more
than
400,000
homes.
while
cbs
was
making
its
investigation
into
the
uhf
situation,
congress
also
was
looking
into
the
situation,
and
stanton,
president
of
cbs
told
the
senate
committee
in
june
1954
that
poller's
station
was
a
vigorously
and
aggressively
manning
uhf
station
and
was
doing
well
in
milwaukee.
and
akerberg,
vice
president
of
cbs-tv
and
one
of
the
defendants
had
a
meeting
with
poller
in
new
york
just
about
that
time,
told
poller
that
cbs
was
very
happy
with
the
job
that
he
was
doing.
by
that
time,
over
200,000
owners
of
sets
in
the
milwaukee
area
had
invested
over
$4
million
in
converters
for
uhf
reception,
and
poller
already
was
on
a
profitable
basis
with
sales
of
about
$110,000
a
month.
but
it
was
only
a
few
days
before
or
after
these
compliments
from
cbs
that
cbs
asked
the
birmingham,
alabama
businessman
named
holt
with
whom
they've
had
some
business
connection
to
come
to
new
york
to
discuss
doing
a
very
hush-hush
job
for
cbs
in
milwaukee.
holt
came
to
new
york,
met
the
top
management
of
cbs
and
agreed
to
accept
the
job
which
was
to
go
to
milwaukee
and
try
to
get
an
option
to
buy
bartell's
woky
station.
holt
went
to
milwaukee
and
in
a
few
days
returned
to
new
york
with
an
option
to
buy
woky
for
$335,000.
of
course
the
whole
matter
was
to
be
kept
secret
from
poller,
to
ensure
which,
holt
and
his
communications
to
cbs
adopted
the
code
name
stonewall
jackson
for
the
operation.
milwaukee
was
called
seven
pines,
birmingham
was
fredericksburg
and
new
york
was
chancellorsville
in
their
communications.
with
poller's
station
doing
very
well,
and
of
course
in
complete
ignorance
of
what
cbs
was
doing
behind
his
back,
poller
signed
a
15-year
lease
on
an
elaborate
new
studio,
he
and
his
wife
individually
guaranteeing
the
rent
and
proceeded
to
rebuild
and
reequip
it.
salant,
one
of
the
vice
presidents
of
cbs,
testified
that
cbs
must
have
known
about
poller's
intention
to
improve
his
facility
in
this
manner,
for
he
said
that
poller
kept
cbs
fully
informed
of
his
plans,
and
poller's
affidavit
said
that
cbs
encouraged
him
to
go
ahead.
mr.
morris
wolf
he
was
--
he
was
an
independent
operator
engaged
with
this
particular
job.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon,
to
buy
this
option.
mr.
morris
wolf
well,
if
he
was
to
acquire
the
option
in
his
own
name,
but
with
the
right
to
assign
it
to
anybody.
mr.
morris
wolf
he
was.
mr.
morris
wolf
he
was
--
he
was
to
get
the
option
for
cbs.
mr.
morris
wolf
the
poller.
mr.
morris
wolf
bartell?
bartell's
--
mr.
morris
wolf
well,
we
alleged
that
--
we
allege
that
bartell
was
one
of
the
conspirators
who
did
act
with
cbs
with
knowledge
of
what
went
on.
i
shall
dwell
on
that
a
little
more
in
detail
as
admitted
by
my
--
cbs,
knowing
poller's
plans
and
knowing
of
this
new
lease
that
he
had
taken,
said
nothing
about
it's
dealings
with
bartell's
for
woky.
about
a
month
and
a
half
after
the
option
was
obtained,
fcc
approved
this
rule
allowing
the
networks
to
acquire
two
uhf
stations.
poller
had
once
wrote
to
stanton,
president
of
cbs,
telling
him
about
the
new
construction
and
promotional
work
he
was
engaged
in,
and
said
that
if
cbs
wanted
to
buy
a
uhf
station,
poller
would
be
glad
to
talk
to
it
about
selling
his
station,
wcan.”
stanton,
with
the
option
on
woky
in
his
pocket,
wrote
to
poller
that
he
wasn't
interested.
without
a
word
of
warning,
a
few
days
later,
cbs
sent
poller
a
telegram
canceling
its
affiliation
agreement,
no
reason
assigned
or
explanation
offered.
it
is
not
difficult
to
guess
what
happened
when
poller
got
the
telegram.
he
rushed
to
new
york
and
unsuccessfully
protested
the
cancellation.
salant
of
cbs
was
amazed
that
poller
protested
the
cancellation.
he
told
poller
that
that
was
one
of
the
hazards
of
the
business,
that
cbs
would
buy
its
own
station,
and
cancel
out
its
affiliate.
he
said
to
him,
“you
don't
oppose
the
inevitable,
you
don't
oppose
the
normal.”
well,
poller
was
really
in
difficulty.
his
affiliation
agreement
with
cbs
was
cancelled
and
both
nbc
and
abc
had
or
about
or
were
about
to
enter
into
affiliation
agreements
with
the
only
two
vhf
stations
in
milwaukee.
poller
had
on
his
hands,
his
15
years
studio
lease,
his
construction
contract
and
his
expensive
equipment.
so
we
come
to
the
last
act.
as
salant
describes
it,
in
the
course
of
our
conversation,
the
suggestion
developed
that
cbs
might
buy
the
physical
equipment,
studio
lease
and
construction
contract,
but
he
told
poller
right
off
the
back
that
cbs
wouldn't
do
a
thing
about
it
unless
poller
said
that
he
would
continue
in
business.
this
has
to
find
salant
probably
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
antitrust
laws.
our
standards
of
contract,
i
would
like
to
think,
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
antitrust
laws
and
they
are
four
times
as
high.
i
need
not
tell
you
that
poller
said
what
cbs
tell
them
that
he
had
to
say
if
he
wanted
to
make
his
deal.
he
testified,
“i
knew
i
had
a
gun
at
my
temple.
i
had
to
say
yes,
and
i
said
yes.
then
i
made
every
effort
to
comply.”
thereupon,
cbs
agreed
to
buy
poller's
station
for
$500,000
and
told
poller
that
he
could
have
the
poor
woky
equipment
for
which
cbs
had
no
use
when
it
bought
poller's
superior
equipment.
mr.
morris
wolf
that's
right.
mr.
morris
wolf
that
--
it
does
not.
with
poller
thus
disposed
of,
cbs
exercised
its
option
on
woky.
then
cbs
drew
up
an
agreement
in
which
poller
dutifully
said,
“as
a
matter
of
window
dressing”
as
he
testified
that
he
intended
to
continue
to
operate
wcan-tv.
however,
before
the
agreement
was
signed,
the
provisions
in
it,
assigning
to
poller
the
woky
studio
and
transmitter
site
without
which
he
could
not
operate
when
he
sold
his
own
studio
and
transmitter
right
to
cbs
were
stricken
out.
after
this
agreement
was
made
with
poller,
fcc
without
a
hearing
or
an
opinion
kindly
granted
the
application
to
transfer
woky
to
cbs.
mr.
morris
wolf
no,
they
are
not
the
equipment,
just
the
studio
lease
and
the
transmitter
location.
mr.
morris
wolf
that's
right.
mr.
morris
wolf
he
--
the
contract
originally
said
that
he
was
to
get
back
a
lease
of
the
woky
studio,
and
the
woky
transmitter
site.
mr.
morris
wolf
but
that
provision
was
stricken
out
of
the
agreement
before
it
was
signed.
so
he
had
no
studio
lease
and
he
had
no
transmitter
site.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
don't
know.
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence
to
show.
i
would
rather
guess,
i
would
be
inclined
to
guess
that
he
wanted
it
stricken
out
because
he
wasn't
going
to
operate
anyway
and
he
didn't
want
to
have
the
obligations
of
the
studio
lease.
that
could
be
my
guess.
there's
nothing
in
the
testimony
--
in
the
record
that
i
have
here
to
show
one
way
or
the
other.
but
it
was
obvious
that
after
that
was
stricken
out,
it
would've
been
impossible
for
him
to
operate.
as
i
said,
the
--
the
fcc
without
a
hearing
or
an
opinion
granted
the
application
to
transfer
woky
to
cbs.
the
order
was
made
by
three
out
of
seven
commissioners,
two
commissioners
dissented,
two
did
not
act.
the
dissenting
commissioner
who
wrote
an
opinion
said,
“cbs's
entry
as
a
licensee
into
the
milwaukee
market,
therefore,
not
only
these
places
an
independent
permanently
but
raises
questions
concerning
the
type
of
operation
which
the
remaining
uhf
operator,
poller,
will
be
in
a
position
to
conduct.
this
was
in
the
opinion
of
the
dissenting
commissioner.
on
february
--
in
february
1955,
closing
under
the
purchase
agreement
between
poller
and
cbs
took
place.
poller
then
was
in
this
position.
he
had
transferred
to
cbs,
all
his
physical
assets
and
his
contracts,
including
the
lease
of
his
studio
and
of
his
transmission
location
and
cbs
continued
that
operation
with
his
studio,
his
equipment
and
his
transmitter
location.
mr.
morris
wolf
under
the
bartell
license,
that's
right.
poller
had
no
studio
and
no
transmitter
site.
his
affiliation
agreement
with
cbs
was
at
an
end
and
he
could
not
get
one
with
nbc
or
abc,
they
already
were
committed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
so
clear
was
it
to
poller
that
he
could
not
continue
after
the
station
was
sold
to
cbs,
but
already
in
january,
two
months
before
closing
under
his
contract
with
cbs,
in
anticipation
of
the
discontinuance
of
its
business,
the
stockholders
of
midwest
had
adopted
the
plan
of
liquidation
and
dissolution.
when
poller
got
the
woky
equipment,
put
it
in
storage,
the
wcan-tv
was
out
of
business.
it
never
went
back.
it
kept
its
permit
alive,
but
has
not
operated.
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
subsequent
events
except
that
later,
a
man
named
storer
who
had
wanted
to
buy
poller's
station
but
had
been
discouraged
by
cbs
from
doing
so,
acquired
a
third
vhf
station
in
milwaukee
whereupon
cbs
and
he
entered
into
an
affiliation
agreement,
where
that
vhf
station
and
cbs
promptly
closed
woky,
its
uhf
station
thus
confirming
what
poller
had
said
from
the
beginning
that
cbs
planned
to
destroy
any
hope
that
uhf
stations
would
be
successful
on
a
commercial
plane
in
protection
of
its
vested
greater
interest
in
vhf
operation.
these
indeed
are
the
outlines
of
the
course
of
events
that
led
to
the
silencing
of
poller's
uhf
station.
as
presented
to
the
trial
court
after
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
record
consisted
of
the
pleadings,
interrogatories
and
answers,
affidavits
and
depositions.
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
well
treated
this
record
as
if
there
had
been
a
complete
trial
of
the
case
in
court,
as
if
both
sides
had
rested
and
as
if
it
now
were
up
to
a
jury
to
bring
in
a
verdict.
these
courts
also
considered
that
they
themselves
were
the
jury,
should
determine,
whose
testimony
they
believed
and
decide
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
this
belief
incredibility.
with
all
due
respect,
i
submit
that
this
record
--
this
method
of
disposing
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
under
rule
56,
that
judicial
atomic
bomb,
shows
a
complete
misunderstanding
of
the
scope
of
such
a
motion
and
can
produce
a
fall-out
which
will
wreck
the
whole
theory
of
pretrial
preparation
of
jury
cases.
in
the
first
place,
it
assumes
that
a
record
like
the
one
here
represents
the
entire
case
that
can
be
presented
to
the
jury,
and
therefore,
as
a
safe
basis
on
which
to
render
a
verdict.
plaintiff
and
defendants
both
have
had
their
full
say.
this
is
totally
unrealistic.
every
trial
lawyer
knows
that
pretrial
procedure
never
was
designed
or
used
to
bring
out
the
entire
case
of
either
side.
if
as
the
lower
court
here
thought,
these
trial
procedures
presented
all
that
there
was
in
the
way
of
evidence
and
if
in
addition,
the
court
on
motion
for
summary
judgment
might
pass
on
the
credibility
of
such
witnesses
as
filed
pretrial
affidavits
or
gave
pretrial
depositions,
there
would
be
very
little
need
for
juries.
all
cases
could
be
determined
on
summary
judgment,
probably
to
the
great
delight
of
the
trial
courts
which
shudder
at
the
thought
of
time
consuming
antitrust
jury
cases.
certainly,
neither
side
is
obliged
to
call
any
witnesses
pretrial
certainly
not
all
the
witnesses
it
may
wish
to
call
neither
as
either
side
required
to
ask
any
witness
on
cross-examination,
all
the
questions,
it
will
want
to
ask
the
witness
in
court.
the
essential
purpose
of
each
side
pretrial
is
to
get
as
much
damaging
evidence
from
the
other
side
as
it
can
to
use
at
the
trial
while
revealing
as
little
of
its
own
evidence
as
is
possible.
in
the
second
place,
the
court
on
consideration
of
motions
to
dismiss
may
not
base
their
action
or
their
determination
of
the
credibility
of
witnesses.
that
is
solely
a
function
of
the
jury
which
sees
and
hears
the
witnesses.
the
function
of
rule
56
and
it
is
a
most
important
one,
is
to
permit
the
dismissal
of
an
action
where
there
are
no
questions
of
fact
which
would
entitle
the
plaintiff
to
go
to
a
jury,
the
pure
unadulterated
questions
of
law.
because
this
is
the
essential
feature
of
my
argument,
i
must
mention
the
leading
case
on
the
use
and
the
views
of
the
motions
for
summary
judgment
is
arnstein
against
porter
in
a
154
f.2d
which
is
not
in
our
brief.
judge
jerome
frank's
opinion
in
that
case,
presents
my
argument
on
my
--
on
this
point
so
much
better
than
i
can,
but
except
for
a
possible
accusation
of
plagiarism,
i
should've
copied
it
in
toto
instead
of
using
my
own
language.
i
quote
just
a
few
sentences
from
it.
“although
part
of
plaintiff's
testimony
on
deposition,
does
seem
fantastic,
yet
plaintiff's
credibility,
even
as
to
those
improbabilities
should
be
left
to
jury.
it
follows
that
as
credibility
is
unavoidably
involved,
a
genuine
question
of
material
fact
presents
itself.
it
has
been
said,
that
as
the
appearance
and
manner
of
the
witness
is
often
a
complete
antidote
to
what
he
testifies,
we
cannot
very
well
overestimate
the
importance
of
having
the
witness
examine
and
cross-examine
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
jury.
this
brings
us
to
the
consideration
of
the
questions
of
fact
which
should
have
been
left
to
a
jury
in
this
case.
first,
we
mentioned
three
general
principles
of
law
which
are
relevant
to
our
discussion.
the
first
is,
like
where
there
are
number
of
acts,
all
calculated
to
bring
about
one
result,
if
the
result
is
illegal,
it
is
not
safe
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
some
of
the
individual
acts
or
even
all
of
them
individually
leading
up
to
the
final
result
maybe
legal.
mr.
morris
wolf
yes
indeed.
mr.
morris
wolf
well,
he
said
that
but
he
didn't
do
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
said
the
contrary.
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
testimony
of
those
witnesses
who
were
defendants
and
whom
we
called
for
cross-examination
and
i'm
going
in
a
minute
to
say
--
mr.
morris
wolf
--
who
they
were
if
i
may.
the
events
from
the
--
the
summons
to
hold
at
birmingham,
to
the
closing
down
of
wcan
constituted
a
single
transaction,
fractions
of
which
separately
considered
may
have
been
legal,
but
the
end
result
of
which
was
illegal.
salant
of
cbs
testified,
he
was
asked,
“regardless
of
what
the
dates
were
in
regard
to
the
formal
actions,
it
was
all
part
of
one
transaction.
you
aren't
going
to
buy
the
station
of
woky-tv
and
continue
to
let
poller
be
your
affiliate
in
milwaukee,
were
you?”
“no.”
the
other
general
principles
are
that
people
are
responsible
for
a
result
which
a
jury
finds
as
the
natural
consequence
of
their
acts
and
that
acts
speak
louder
than
words.
before
coming
to
these
questions
of
fact,
however,
we
discussed
for
a
minute
a
matter
which
is
not
a
question
of
fact,
does
not
depend
on
anybody's
credibility
and
is
exactly
the
kind
of
question
as
to
which
a
motion
to
dismiss
is
appropriate.
this
is
the
question,
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
cbs-tv,
a
separate
or
autonomous
division
of
cbs
incorporated,
can
be
a
party
to
a
conspiracy
with
cbs
inc.
when
the
division
is
not
incorporated,
assuming
as
we
do,
that
under
timken
it
could
be
a
conspirator,
if
it
were
incorporated.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
in
the
absence
of
a
charter,
cbs
and
cbs-tv
were
one
entity
and
could
not
conspire
with
each
other
anymore
than,
if
i
may
invent
(inaudible),
a
child
en
ventre
sa
mere
could
conspire
with
his
mother.
judge
washington
thought
that
the
absence
of
a
charter
was
not
controlling,
but
he
did
not
base
his
dissent
on
that
ground.
we
feel,
looking
at
the
situation
realistically,
if
a
court
may
pierce
the
corporate
veil
and
hold
two
corporations
to
be
one,
where
they
are
functionally
one,
the
court
may
cut
the
corporate
veil
and
hold
that
one
corporation
as
two,
where
they
are
functionally
two.
we
maintain
this
position,
but
we
need
not
rely
on
it.
we
pointed
out
--
mr.
morris
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
morris
wolf
not
a
separate
corporation.
mr.
morris
wolf
functionally,
entirely
separate.
mr.
morris
wolf
well,
it
had
its
own
officers.
it
had
its
own
bank
account.
it
signed
the
contract
for
example
with
poller,
the
affiliation
contract.
its
records
were
kept
separately.
in
every
--
in
every
way,
in
which
it
could
be
separate
functionally
it
was.
the
purpose
of
cbs
in
having
these
various
divisions
was
the
key
to
separate
activities
of
his
business
in
separate
channels,
and
each
of
these
channels
therefore
operated
autonomously.
of
course,
cb
--
the
controlling
cbs
as
if
it
were
a
holding
company
had
final
say
on
general
--
matters
of
general
policy.
mr.
morris
wolf
yes
--
mr.
morris
wolf
yes,
there
is
president,
vice-president,
treasurer
and
secretary.
it's
all
in
the
record.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
morris
wolf
yes.
mr.
morris
wolf
cbs-tv.
well,
they
have
assigned
the
cbs-tv
a
division
of
cbs
inc.
mr.
morris
wolf
by
the
president
of
cbs-tv.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
don't
--
i
don't
remember
whether
in
the
signature
it
said
that
or
the
testimony
says
that
he
was
the
man
who
signed,
it
was
that.
mr.
morris
wolf
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
the
contract
is
on
page
82.
no,
the
contract
is
on
page
50
--
60.
the
signature
is
on
page
59.
signature
is
akerberg
at
the
bottom
of
59
who
was
the
vice
president.
he
signed
it
in
the
wrong
place,
but
he
is
the
vice
president
of
cbs
television,
page
59.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
say
that
where
you
could
show
that,
if
there
was
a
charter,
there's
no
reason
why
looking
at
it
realistically,
you
can't
show
that.
the
only
difference
is
that
there
is
not
a
charter.
however,
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
time
on
this
because,
i'm
really
--
mr.
morris
wolf
this
is
theoretical
matter
which
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
establish
in
order
to
--
in
this
part
of
my
case.
i'm
really
pointing
it
out
more
than
for
any
other
purpose
to
say
that
this
is
a
matter,
properly
disposable
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
but
whether
individuals
not
connected
with
cbs
or
cbs-tv
conspired
is
purely
a
question
of
fact
defending
for
a
determination
on
their
credibility.
judge
rosenman's
statement
that
the
testimony
of
various
--
of
the
witnesses
we
called
must
be
believed
as
a
matter
of
law
we
deny.
and
i
now
come
to
a
consideration
of
holt.
holt
was
the
man
from
birmingham
who
put
in
motion,
what
ultimately
resulted
in
the
elimination
of
poller's
television
station
in
milwaukee.
we
claim
that
he
was
a
conspirator,
that
he
conspired
with
cbs
to
bring
about
this
result
that
knowing
the
purpose
and
likely
effect
what
the
cbs
have
plotted
at
request
of
cbs
and
for
a
valuable
consideration,
he
performed
in
order
to
carry
out
the
plot,
acts
which
he
knew
were
necessary
in
order
that
it
should
be
done.
mr.
morris
wolf
$10,000.
mr.
morris
wolf
it
is
perfectly
true
that
holt
denied
not
only
that
he
conspired
with
cbs
in
the
plot
to
put
poller
out
of
business
but
that
he
had
the
faintest
idea
that
there
was
such
a
plot
and
the
court
of
appeals
believed
him.
we
can
see
that
a
jury
too,
after
seeing
and
hearing
holt
may
believe
him,
but
we
respectfully
deny
that
the
court
had
a
right
to
accept
his
statement
as
a
basis
for
a
summary
judgment
against
this.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
morris
wolf
he
was
a
general
businessman.
i'm
going
to
speak
of
that
in
a
minute.
mr.
morris
wolf
he
had
a
lot
of
experience
in
television.
may
i
tell
you
--
mr.
morris
wolf
--
what
his
experience
was?
i'm
going
to
say
that
if
an
alleged
conspirator's
denial
that
he
was
a
conspirator
was
considered
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
to
establish
that
he
was
not,
there
would
be
very
few
convictions
of
conspiracy.
we
believe
that
even
from
holt's
own
testimony
already
given,
quite
outside
of
what
might
be
developed
further
at
a
trial,
quite
outside
of
the
impression
that
this
manner
on
the
witness
stand
might
give,
a
jury
probably
will
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
about
holt's
credibility.
will
you
not
believe
that
a
jury
will
accept
as
true
his
story
of
the
initial
briefing
session
in
new
york
at
which
all
the
top
men
of
cbs
were
present
which
he
was
asked
to
get
this
option?
according
to
his
story,
he
asked
no
information
and
was
given
none
about
the
job
he
was
about
to
undertake.
he
thought
he
was
picked
out
for
the
job
because
he
was
a
country
boy
probably
could
handle
bartell's
better
than
a
city
slicker.
in
fact,
he
was
not
a
country
boy
not
to
consider
whether
birmingham
is
a
country
town.
he
had
years
of
experience
in
television,
had
been
chairman
of
the
federal
reserve
board
and
was
on
terms
of
mutual
confidence
with
cbs.
“he
took
it
for
granted,”
he
says,
“that
if
cbs
bought
woky,
it
would
move
its
programs
to
that
station”
and
he
was
given
background
written
material
before
he
left
new
york
which
showed
that
poller's
station,
wcan,
had
television
affiliation.
how
much
more
he
learned
about
the
milwaukee
area
situation
after
he
began
talking
to
bartell's,
we
cannot
know
until
he
is
examined
on
that
subject.
it
may
be
as,
i
have
said,
that
in
spite
of
all
we
can
show,
the
jury
still
will
decide
that
holt
did
not
know
what
was
going
on
and
the
cbs
had
been
smart
enough
to
select
for
the
delicate
job
of
getting
the
option
one
of
the
few
men
in
the
united
states
withhold
experience
in
television
and
in
finance
who
was
naïve
enough
not
to
understand
what
cbs
was
up
to.
mr.
morris
wolf
pardon
me.
mr.
morris
wolf
oh,
this
was
--
this
was
so
that
if
anybody
saw
the
correspondence,
they
wouldn't
know
that
it
was
about
milwaukee
and
new
york.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon.
well
--
mr.
morris
wolf
--
this
was
just
part
of
the
strategy.
evidently
he
was
a
civil
war
historian.
mr.
morris
wolf
the
total
consideration
from
bartell's
--
mr.
morris
wolf
$335,000.
mr.
morris
wolf
holt
got
$10,000.
mr.
morris
wolf
no.
that
was
in
addition
to
the
three.
mr.
morris
wolf
yes.
mr.
morris
wolf
that's
right.
that
was
useless
that
he
got
that.
so
much
for
holt,
now
as
to
bartell's,
just
how
much
bartell's
knew
about
this
scheme,
we
cannot
tell.
there
were
three
bartell's
who
owned
woky.
none
of
them
was
examined
on
deposition.
one
of
them
submitted
a
brief
affidavit
in
which
he
said
he
had
no
knowledge
that
cbs
was
the
interested
party.
he
adds
by
way
of
hearsay
that
he
is
sure
that
none
of
his
associates
had.
just
what
will
be
developed
at
a
trial,
when
he
and
his
associates
are
examined,
we
cannot
tell.
however,
the
evidence
is
clear
that
bartell's,
long
before
closing
the
cbs
under
their
option
agreement
with
holt,
knew
that
cbs
was
the
interested
party.
with
this
information,
they
nevertheless
went
ahead
and
completed
their
deal,
surely
knowing
what
the
result
would
be
as
far
as
poller
was
concerned.
if
knowing
that,
they
went
ahead
and
carried
out
the
option
agreement,
the
jury
may
find
that
bartell's
joined
the
conspiracy
since
they
could
not
have
been
compelled
to
complete
their
agreement
with
cbs
when
they
found
out
that
in
the
circumstances
of
the
matter,
the
agreement
violated
the
antitrust
law.
what
testimony
would
be
brought
out
of
the
trial
if
the
case
from
other
witnesses,
nobody
can
tell
at
this
time.
there
were
three
other
cbs
people
of
the
meeting
with
holt
in
new
york
from
whom
nothing
has
been
--
has
been
heard,
the
three
other
shareholders
of
woky
from
whom
nothing
has
been
heard.
as
we've
said,
there
is
no
obligation
on
poller
pretrial
to
call
all
the
witnesses
that
he
had
or
to
examine
those
who
were
called
as
exhaustively
as
he
could.
if
as
we
have
argued,
the
jury
may
find
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
among
cbs
and
others,
we
come
to
the
next
question,
was
the
conspiracy
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws?
court
of
appeals
thought
as
a
matter
of
law
that
it
was
not.
judge
washington
thought
that
this
was
a
question
of
fact
for
a
jury.
we
consider
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
the
conspiracy.
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy?
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
record
from
any
cbs
witness
which
answers
the
question
of
why
cbs
undertook
the
destruction
of
poller.
what
explanation
cbs
may
give
at
a
trial,
we
do
not
know.
we
assert
that
the
purpose
of
cbs
was
to
buy
poller's
station
as
cheaply
as
possible
in
order
to
own
and
operate
woky
as
the
only
uhf
station
in
the
milwaukee
area
with
the
effect
on
competition
described
hereafter.
we
can
see
that
cbs
denied
all
of
this.
we
also
admit
that
the
incomplete
record
now
before
this
court
on
pretrial
evidence
does
not
go
nearly
so
far
toward
proof
as
we
expect
to
go
on
the
trial
of
the
case.
however,
what
other
reason
could
cbs
have
had?
we
start
out
with
the
undisputed
fact.
poller
was
an
exceptionally
able
and
successful
station
operator,
was
producing
good
results
with
his
uhf
station
through
not
only
exceptionally
of
good
by
highly
surprising.
up
to
the
time
of
the
cancellation
of
the
affiliation
agreement,
cbs
had
had
no
complaint
against
poller,
any
quarrel
or
disagreement
with
him
concerning
any
matter
connected
with
his
operation
of
the
station
or
his
relations
with
cbs.
the
next
circumstance
is
that
it
is
not
normal
to
terminate
an
affiliation
agreement
where
this
agreeable
situation
exists.
stanton
testified,
“we
don't
change
any
affiliation
agreement
because
of
when
it
is
based
on
performance.”
then
he
was
asked,
“where
the
operator
is
performing
well
and
the
station
is
prosperous
and
things
are
satisfactory,
it
is
advantageous
to
you,
you'll
normally
continue
regardless
of
the
two-year
limitation.”
that
is
absolutely
correct.
in
spite
of
this
general
policy
all
through
the
case,
appears
statements
by
stanton
and
by
salant
that
since
they
had
refused
poller's
request
to
modify
the
six
months
cancellation
notice,
poller
should
have
known
better
than
to
make
a
long-term
lease,
build
a
fine
new
station
as
if
the
six
months
cancellation
notice
was
an
exception
or
provision
in
the
cbs
affiliation
agreements.
as
the
matter
of
fact,
the
record
show
that
in
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
morris
wolf
no,
as
if
it
was.
they
spoke
of
it
--
mr.
morris
wolf
--
as
if
it
was
unusual.
now,
i
am
about
to
say
that
in
the
record,
it
appears
that
75
of
their
affiliation
agreements
contain
cancellation
clauses
of
six
months
or
less.
no
affiliation
agreement
could
be
for
more
than
two
years
under
the
fcc
regulations.
if
affiliates
could
not
depend
on
more
than
one
year
which
is
the
longest
cancellation
notice
provided
in
any
of
the
affiliation
agreements,
how
could
the
industry
ever
have
been
built?
if
it
was
extremely
unwise
with
the
six
months
cancellation
notice
for
an
affiliate
to
invest
the
large
amount
in
his
station,
it
would
be
only
slightly
less
reckless
for
him
to
do
it
with
the
one
year
cancellation
notice
and
all
the
stations
in
the
whole
industry
would
have
been
built
on
a
makeshift
basis.
the
fact
is
that
in
spite
of
the
short-term
of
these
affiliation
agreements,
the
whole
stability
of
the
industry
depends
and
has
been
built
on
the
supposition
that
affiliation
agreements
will
be
renewed
indefinitely
as
long
as
the
station
operator
is
loyal
and
skillful.
stanton
himself,
president
of
cbs,
recognized
this
and
agreed
that
“broadcasters
invest
large
sums
of
money
in
stations
in
reliance
on
the
affiliation
agreement
even
though
they
know
that
it
is
terminable
in
the
two-year
period.”
although
as
we
have
said,
cbs
has
not
advanced
any
explanation
of
why
it
withdrew
its
affiliation
agreement
from
poller,
both
stanton
and
salant
have
pretended
that
their
most
adherent
wish
was
that
poller
would
continue
in
business
in
competition
with
their
woky
station.
stanton
said,
“all
i
was
interested
in
doing,
looking
back
on
it,
was
seeing
that
we
didn't
diminish
the
number
of
stations
operating
in
the
community.”
and
salant,
his
--
the
assistant
who
handled
this
transaction
said,
“i
said
to
poller
that
i
didn't
want
cbs
or
me
to
be
in
a
position
where
we
were
acquiring
one
station
and
putting
another
off
the
air.
and
i
told
him
i
would
not
consider
buying
his
equipment
unless
i
was
sure,
as
sure
as
one
could
be
and
i
was
sure
too
that
there
would
be
the
same
number
of
stations
on
the
air
after
this
whole
thing
was
completed
as
there
were
now.
the
jury
may
believe
this,
but
there
is
enough
evidence
in
the
record
to
allow
the
jury
to
disbelieve
the
sincerity,
the
cbs's
protestations
that
it
desired
or
expected
poller
to
remain
in
business
in
competition
with
cbs.
it
is
true
that
in
the
agreement
poller
said
that
he
continued
--
intended
to
continue
to
operate
his
station,
but
as
the
agreement
itself
shows,
cbs
did
not
agree
to
provide
any
location
for
its
operation
since
there
was
no
location
in
which
poller
could
operate
a
station
when
he
got
bartell's
old
equipment,
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
except
put
it
in
the
warehouse
which
is
what
he
did,
which
was
perfectly
obvious
to
cbs.
so
a
jury
may
decide
--
mr.
morris
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
morris
wolf
it
has
been
in
business
before
it
was
taken
over
about
eight
months.
mr.
morris
wolf
it
was
not
doing
well,
no.
mr.
morris
wolf
they
have
been
going
just
about
a
month
shorter
time
than
poller
has.
mr.
morris
wolf
he
is
what?
mr.
morris
wolf
he's
been
in
business
about
two
or
three
months
or
longer
than
bartell's.
so
as
i
say,
the
jury
may
decide
that
cbs's
insistence
on
keeping
poller
in
business
was
nothing
but
pretence,
and
that
both
cbs
and
poller
knew
very
well
that
when
cbs
bought
poller's
equipment
and
location
for
their
own
station,
he
was
through
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
their
purchase
of
woky
in
the
first
place.
the
reasons
they
bought
poller's
equipment
and
locations
were
first,
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
poller
had
a
fast
and
sure
demise.
the
second
was
if
they
had
a
bad
conscience.
as
salant
said
at
this
transaction
which
he
had
engineered,
it
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
enjoy
or
appreciate,
surely
a
under
statement,
not
that
the
sherman
act
has
any
insurance
against
business
cruelty.
the
third
was
that
it
was
a
tremendous
benefit
to
cbs.
together,
the
bargain
price,
a
brand
new
station
with
fine
equipment
in
working
order
and
to
be
able
to
continue
without
interruption,
the
operation
which
poller
was
performing
so
well.
as
to
the
bartell
equipment,
cbs
--
cbs
had
no
use
for
it.
it
wasn't
even
testified
that
poller
asked
for
it.
the
real
purpose
of
giving
this
to
poller
was
to
create
some
pretence
that
poller
would
stay
in
business
but
the
pretence
became
quite
transparent
when
it
was
obvious
that
when
he
got
the
equipment,
he
had
no
place
to
put
it.
having
considered
the
purposes
of
the
cbs
activities,
we
now
consider
their
effect.
assuming
that
a
jury
found
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
among
the
defendants
to
get
poller's
station
for
cbs-tv,
could
the
jury
find
that
the
conspiracy
had
the
effect
of
a
restraint
of
trade
or
an
attempt
to
monopolize
the
sherman
act?
we
submit
that
a
jury
surely
could
so
find.
in
the
first
place,
the
conspiracy
directly
affected
the
milwaukee
area
market.
before
cbs
bought
woky
and
used
its
leverage
as
a
network
to
force
poller
to
sell
his
station,
there
were
two
independent
uhf
stations
in
the
milwaukee
area
competing
not
only
with
each
other,
but
also
with
the
milwaukee
area
vhf
stations
for
local
and
national
spot
advertising
and
local
news
programs
with
the
further
potentiality
of
competing
for
affiliations
with
any
of
the
three
national
networks
no
matter
how
unlikely
it
was
that
bartell's
with
their
inferior
operation
could
win
such
an
affiliation.
after
cbs
bought
woky,
poller
was
out
of
business.
there
was
only
one
uhf
station
in
the
milwaukee
area
and
that
was
owned
and
operated
not
by
an
independent
but
by
the
largest
of
the
three
giant
networks.
this
naturally
in
the
words
of
the
opinion
in
u.s.
against
du
pont
led
to
the
insulation
from
free
competition
of
the
milwaukee
area
markets
for
local
and
spot
advertising
and
local
news
programs
and
remove
the
possibility
of
competition
for
network
affiliations
as
far
as
poller's
station
was
concerned.
that
station
no
longer
existed.
as
to
the
vhf
stations,
there
was
one
competitor
less,
as
to
uhf,
there
was
competitor
at
all
left.
that
market
was
closed
completely.
it
is
no
defense
to
cbs
that
bartell's
might
not
have
survived
even
if
cbs
had
not
entered
the
market.
it
is
true,
within
our
opinion,
a
uhf
station
in
milwaukee
without
a
network
affiliation
could
not
be
profitable.
how
long
bartell's
might
have
lived,
we
do
not
know.
there
is
no
evidence
with
respect
to
his
earning
history
or
its
net
worth.
in
any
event,
it
was
in
the
market
competing
with
poller
until
cbs
put
through
its
deal.
these
were
the
considerations
that
judge
washington
pointed
out.
he
thought
that
poller's
case
was
stronger
than
westinghouse's.
in
that
case,
at
least
there
would
have
been
as
many
stations
left
in
philadelphia
and
cleveland
after
the
exchange
as
there
were
before
whereas
in
our
case,
there
was
one
less
station
when
poller
was
put
out
of
business
in
milwaukee.
as
to
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
judge
washington
found
substantial
indications
that
cbs
had
monopoly
power
over
uhf
in
milwaukee
when
it
cancelled
poller's
affiliation
and
the
jury
might
so
find.
if
the
anti-competitive
effect
of
cbs
were
limited
to
milwaukee,
that
would
be
enough,
and
if
only
poller
were
injured
that
would
be
enough.
but
in
fact,
the
anti-competitive
effect
to
what
cbs
did
in
the
milwaukee
market
affected
televisions
throughout
the
united
states.
every
uh
--
uhf
operator
in
the
united
states
was
put
on
notice
that
if
he
established
a
successful
uhf
station
in
his
community,
cbs,
nbc
or
abc
for
its
own
purposes
might
come
in
to
his
community
by
--
apply
for
a
new
license
or
buy
the
license
of
the
competing
uhf
operator
and
do
to
the
successful
uhf
operator
in
that
community
what
it
did
to
poller
in
milwaukee.
the
fact
that
the
number
of
stations,
the
networks
could
buy
was
limited,
would
not
change
this
situation
because
no
operator
could
tell
whether
one
of
those
it
could
buy
would
be
his.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
think
it
was
both.
i
think
the
immediate
market,
the
most
immediate
was
uhf
in
milwaukee,
the
next
was
uhf
throughout
the
united
states,
and
the
final
was
television
uhf
and
vhf.
that's
our
position.
mr.
morris
wolf
oh
there
was
two
but
it
didn't
affect
the
number
of
vhf
station.
mr.
morris
wolf
left
no
uhf
station
in
competition
with
the
one
that
cbs
bought.
this
kind
--
can
i
have
a
second.
but
beyond
this,
by
acquiring
an
exclusive
position
in
what
cbs
had
selected
as
one
of
the
two
best
markets
for
uhf
in
the
united
states,
cbs
could
conduct
its
operations
in
such
a
way
as
to
influence
adversely
the
growth
of
uhf
throughout
the
united
states
in
protection
of
its
vastly
greater
interest
in
vhf.
ultimately
as
we
have
said,
cbs
abandoned
its
uhf
milwaukee
station
when
it
got
an
affiliation
with
the
third
new
vhf
station
in
milwaukee.
“will
salant's
words
be
prophetic?”
this
is
what
he
said.
i
think
it
would
be
the
kiss
of
death
to
uhf
if
either
nbc
or
cbs
abandoned
a
uhf
station.
psychologically,
it
would
be
terrible.
that's
just
what
cbs
did
in
milwaukee.
when
one
thinks
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
set
owners
in
the
milwaukee
area
who
bought
converters
in
order
to
hear
uhf
broadcasts
and
consider
their
feelings,
when
cbs
closed
the
only
uhf
station
available
to
them,
salant's
statements
that
this
might
be
the
end
of
uhf
seem
no
exaggeration.
in
view
of
these
specific
results
in
the
milwaukee
area
it
is
unnecessary
for
us
to
argue
any
of
those
general
propositions,
which
as
justice
frankfurter
says
there's
such
a
temptation
to
do
when
you
get
him
to
a
specific
case.
may
i
close
with
a
short
quotation
from
an
opinion
of
justice
--
of
judge
jerome
frank
in
the
case
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
sat,
(inaudible)
against
goldsmith
in
conclusion,
“we
cannot
avoid
observing
that
the
case
is
another
mistaken
effort
to
save
time
by
an
attempt
to
dispose
of
a
complicated
set
of
facts
on
a
so
called
motion
for
summary
judgment.”
mr.
morris
wolf
whether
that
all
of
the
facts
were
admitted?
mr.
morris
wolf
the
lower
court
--
both
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
majority
opinion
said
there
was
no
conspiracy,
there
was
no
restraint
of
trade,
and
there
was
no
monopoly.
now,
we
say
there
was
a
conspiracy
and
this
is
what
judge
washington
said.
there
was
a
restraint
of
trade
and
we
have
a
right
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
have
a
jury
so
to
state.
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
assumed
contrary
to
what
judge
rosenman
now
says
he
is
willing
to
concede.
they
both
assumed
that
there
was
not
a
conspiracy
and
that
there
was
not
a
restraint
of
trade.
both
of
those,
i
admit,
in
our
view
are
matters
of
fact
which
we
have
a
right
--
or
have
a
jury
as
upon.
mr.
morris
wolf
judge
washington
says
--
mr.
morris
wolf
judge
washington
says
on
page
301
in
my
view
poller
raises
genuine
issues
of
material
fact
as
to
whether
there
was
a
conspiracy
against
him
in
restraint
of
trade
and
the
monopoly.
the
charges,
he
makes
may
of
course
appear
ultimately
without
foundation.
in
fact
that
he
has
the
right
to
say
that.
mr.
morris
wolf
well,
whether
--
his
view
was
that
these
were
material
facts
--
mr.
morris
wolf
--
as
to
which
the
lower
court,
to
which
the
majority
opinion
had
reached
a
conclusion
of
fact
with
which
he
disagreed.
mr.
morris
wolf
oh,
well
i'm
not
saying
that
in
every
case
it
must
by
all
means
when
all
of
the
evidence
which
the
plaintiff
can
produce
has
been
presented
to
a
jury.
i
would
readily
say
that
a
judge
has
a
right
to
say
there
is
not
enough
to
go
to
a
jury.
but
this
is
not
that
case.
this
is
a
summary
judgment
and
all
of
our
evidence
never
has
been
presented
to
anybody.
that's
the
difference.
mr.
morris
wolf
well
if
a
request
has
been
made
for
a
proffer
approach,
at
a
trial
and
the
plaintiff
has
proffered
all
of
the
evidence
which
he
says
it
will
be
within
his
power
to
produce,
i
do
not
say
that
it
would
be
outside
of
the
possibility
of
proper
court
procedure
for
the
trial
court
to
say,
“i
don't
think
that's
enough”
but
that
isn't
what
has
happened
here.
our
case
has
not
been
developed.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
morris
wolf
well,
certainly.
mr.
morris
wolf
well,
certainly
not,
this
is
a
pretrial.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
am
--
i
am
suggesting
that
in
no
case
where
there
are
issues
of
fact
is
summary
judgment
a
proper
measure
of
determination
by
the
trial
court,
by
a
lower
court.
mr.
morris
wolf
of
course,
of
course.
mr.
morris
wolf
oh!
no!
i
don't
think
so,
i
think
it
has
the
proper
--
it
has
the
duty
and
the
right
to
determine
the
questions
of
law,
which
arise
if
there
are
no
questions
of
fact,
for
example,
in
us
against
rca.
the
court
on
summary
judgment
had
a
perfect
right
to
determine
whether
it
is
a
by
fcc
that
it
was
alright
to
take
away
the
westinghouse
station
was
a
matter
of
fact
or
a
matter
of
law.
that
was
purely
a
matter
of
law
proper
for
determination
on
summary
judgment.
there
was
no
question
of
fact
involved
there.
mr.
morris
wolf
that's
what
--
that's
what
i
am
saying.
i
am
saying
that
the
--
the
summary
judgment
serves
only
the
matter
of
determining
whether
there
are
nothing
but
issues
of
law.
if
there
are
nothing
but
issues
of
law,
they
are
properly
determinable
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
if
there
are
questions
of
facts,
they
are
determinable
on
the
summary
judgment.
mr.
morris
wolf
yes.
mr.
morris
wolf
that's
the
most
important
of
all.
mr.
morris
wolf
well,
i
certainly
say
your
honor,
that
to
say
that
it
does
not
appear.
it
does
not
seem
to
west
that
the
purpose
was
to
restrain
trade
or
commerce
as
obviously
a
question
of
fact
which
judge
miller
had
no
right
--
mr.
morris
wolf
--
to
decide.
mr.
morris
wolf
well,
certainly
unless
and
until
all
the
facts
have
been
developed,
it's
impossible
for
either
the
court
or
the
jury
to
draw
any
inferences,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
morris
wolf
yes,
you're
right.
mr.
morris
wolf
certainly
not
because
you
have
the
findings
of
the
lower
court
on
which
to
decide.
mr.
morris
wolf
well,
i
think
that
we're
really
getting
into
a
question,
what
is
an
inference,
whether
an
inference
is
an
ultimate
finding
of
facts
or
whether
it
is
a
--
mr.
morris
wolf
well
when
you
say
inferences,
i
don't
know
whether
you
mean
conclusions
of
facts,
you
have
the
one
thing
--
mr.
morris
wolf
well
of
course,
you
leave
to
a
jury
the
question
to
whether
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
facts
that
one
of
the
negligence
or
not
of
negligence
and
i
say
the
same
thing
here.
the
inference
to
be
drawn
--
should
be
drawn
by
the
jury
as
to
whether
the
purpose
and
effect
of
what
was
done
was
to
restrain
faith,
that's
my
main
point.
