mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
wolf,
do
i
understand
that
at
the
end,
cbs
cancelled
out
the
--
its
contract
to
sell
him
the
equipment
of
the
--
his
competitor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
--
i
know
that
mr.
poller
sold
that
to
--
to
cbs.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
he
got
back
in
return
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
over
his
objection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
it
wasn't
unusual.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
judge
rosenman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
judge
rosenman,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
pertinent
or
not
but
could
you
tell
us
how
these
three
big
networks
compare
in
numbers
of
umfs
if
they
have
affiliations
--
affiliations
with?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
it
probably
is
pertinent
to
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
judge
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
he
deducted
the
$500,000
also?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
judge
rosenman,
it
was
either
mr.
wolf
or
you,
i
don't
remember
which
said
that
it
wasn't
possible
for
the
umf
to
survive
unless
it
did
have
an
affiliation,
which
one
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
i,
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
fact
that
should
be
determined,
must
be
determined
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
he
could
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
judge
rosenman,
may
ask
this
question?
it
might
be
one
thing
for
cbs
to
change
its
affiliation
from
one
station
to
another,
might
it
not
be
another
thing
for
cbs
to
grant
an
affiliation
of
this
kind
to
a
station
and
then
induce
the
station
to
put
in
a
good
equipment
and
to
have
us
find
--
find
a
plant
and
give
his
good
services
that
can
for
fear
that
their
affiliation
might
be
revoked
if
they
didn't
give
good
service.
and
then
after
that
is
done
to
have
cbs
come
in
and
take
it
away
from
him
for
the
purpose
not
of
giving
it
to
someone
else
who
would
render
better
service
but
for
the
purpose
of
taking
it
itself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
finish
your
thought.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
have
them,
you
may
state
them
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much,
judge
rosenman.
mr.
wolf,
your
time
has
expired
but
would
you
take
not
more
than
two
minutes
please
to
respond
to
the
same
question
that
justice
frankfurter
asked.
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly
and
so
treated
by
the
court,
isn't
it
the
â€“-
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
wolf.
