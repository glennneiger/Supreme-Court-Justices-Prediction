mr.
robert
klonsky
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
klonsky
your
honors,
we
are
here
concerned
with
the
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
jones
act
seaman's
verdict
related
to
james
victor
salem
who
was
a
lookout
able-bodied
seaman
aboard
respondents
s.
s.
united
states.
we
are
also
here
concerned
with
a
reversal
of
an
award
for
future
maintenance
given
by
the
trial
judge
on
consent
of
the
parties.
the
major
issue
involved
here
relates
itself
to
whether
the
initial
verdict
on
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
was
infirmed
because
of
the
failure
of
the
plaintiff
to
present
an
expert
on
maritime
architecture
with
respect
to
a
simple
issue
of
obvious
danger
and
perhaps
it
would
be
best
for
us
to
formulate
the
issue
in
light
of
some
of
the
facts
involved
in
this
case.
it
seems
that
this
s.
s.
united
states
at
its
record
speed,
coursing
at
a
winter
sea
on
february
16,
1958
was
two
days
from
the
port
of
new
york.
they
had
in
the
fore
part
of
the
vessel
a
65-foot
hollow
aluminum
tower,
known
as
a
radar
tower,
consisting
of
several
platforms.
and
the
platform
that
was
31
feet
above
the
deck
would
be
the
platform
onto
which
the
crow's-nest
personnel
would
step
while
coming
off
an
up
and
down
ladder
and
then
go
into
a
bubble
in
the
forward
part
of
its
radar
tower
to
perform
their
function
as
lookout
seamen.
now,
this
tower
was
completely
closed
at
the
top
and
the
only
illumination
provided
were
by
five
serially
placed
lights,
one
above
the
other,
two
of
them
above
the
crow's-nest,
two
below
the
crow's-nest
level
of
31
feet
above
and
one
at
its
parallel
distance.
mr.
robert
klonsky
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
klonsky
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
klonsky
there
was
radar
on
there
too.
they
have
cable
(voice
overlap)
much
further
up
and
people
really
went
there
and
there
were
cables,
so
they
were
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
klonsky
no,
no
sir,
the
radar
scope,
i
would
imagine,
would
be
at
the
very
top,
but
this
--
mr.
robert
klonsky
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
klonsky
right
sir.
mr.
robert
klonsky
exactly.
mr.
robert
klonsky
and
the
manner
in
which
they
would
get
to
this
particular
platform
level
would
be
to
find
an
up
and
down
ladder
which
is
15
inches
wide
or
foot
apart
the
rungs,
and
then
they
have
to
breach
the
open
space,
this
manhole,
by
putting
one
foot
behind
them
hoping
to
grab
holes
of
a
radar
enclosure
which
is
a
rather
bulky
piece
of
a
pertinence
and
then
swing
the
other
leg
around
and
then
walk
towards
the
door
which
would
lead
into
the
bubble
which
was
the
radar
--
which
was
the
crow's-nest
area
in
which
also
incidentally
there
was
a
telephone.
well,
as
i
say,
they
had
these
five
lights
and
the
two
lights
above
the
crow's-nest
platform
had
been
out
for
months
prior
to
the
accident.
the
two
lights
below
this
crow's-nest
platform
were
out
when
mr.
salem
came
to
work
at
12
midnight
on
this
day
and
it
had
been
the
subject
of
unsuccessful
repair
six
days
before
without
any
follow
check
up
by
the
electrician.
so
we
are
now
faced
with
this
vessel,
seven
degrees
to
port,
six
degrees
stop
and
rolling
in
a
rather
rough
sea
with
basic
--
with
passing
the
rain
squalls,
the
vibration
transposed
to
this
particular
radar
tower
using
ordinary
household
bulbs
instead
of
any
vibration
bulbs
with
the
platform
itself
without
any
skid
proof
paint
for
friction
for
the
seaman
who
will
have
to
take
this
awkward
and
dangerous
procedure
of
coming
over,
we
see
that
at
the
time
of
the
accident
which
was
at
2:30
a.m.,
that
last
light
went
out.
mr.
robert
klonsky
the
bulbs
are
burning
out
at
the
rate
of
500
to
600
a
day
aboard
this
ship
and
that
was
shown
by
the
electrician's
testimony
because
--
mr.
robert
klonsky
thousands
of
thousands
of
them,
yes
your
honor,
but
this
was
done
according
to
the
chief
porter
master,
by
reason
of
the
excessive
vibration
caused
by
the
record
speed
of
this
vessel.
and
they
use,
as
he
said,
ordinary
household
bulbs,
500
to
600.
we
know
that
they
--
for
months,
the
upper
two
bulbs
that
would
have
cast
illumination
in
a
crow's-nest
platform
were
out.
we
know
that
the
two
bulbs
below
were
out
at
least
since
12
o'clock
midnight
when
he
came
on
duty
and
then
our
concern
with
something
that
happened
at
2:30,
when
he
came
back
from
a
coffee
break
and
there
was
a
relief
lookout
man
by
the
name
of
richards
inside
this
crow's-nest.
as
he
came
over
unto
this
platform
and
before
he
could
do
anything
further
in
walking
towards
the
door,
he
slipped
backwards.
and
remember,
this
platform
itself
was
worn,
no
skid
proof
paint
though
falsely
in
answer
to
interrogatories
the
defendant
said
they
had
that
and
he
struck
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
rungs
of
a
ladder
behind
him.
he
struck
his
lumbar
area
on
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
he
yelled
for
help
and
richards
came
out
groping
for
him
and
that
was
relief
man
f
and
asked
him
if
he
could
sit
there
for
a
while,
while
he
went
into
the
crow's-nest
to
telephone
the
bridge
and
we
show
too
that
he
could
have
reached
him
while
holding
the
man
and
not
had
left
him
abandoned
there.
and
he
left
the
man
sit
on
a
narrow
ledge
with
his
feet
dangling
over
to
this
open
space
while
he
went
inside
the
telephone
and
salem
passed
out
again
and
fell
another
distance
into
this
hole
and
finally,
he
was
rescued
by
the
use
of
flashlights
and
testimonies
to
clear
on
that.
well,
while
he
was
in
the
ship's
hospital
for
two
days,
extensive
medical
notations
were
made
by
a
doctor
fainger
as
to
this
man
screaming
with
pain,
immobilized
in
traction,
given
glucose,
heartbeat
irregular,
pulse
skipping
beats,
the
man
seemed
to
be
paralyzed
in
one
leg,
dark
circles
around
his
eyes.
the
reason
i
say
this
is
because
this
particular
hospital
record,
on
the
ship,
was
never
furnished
to
the
marine
hospital
when
he
got
off
the
vessel.
nor
was
it
even
shown
to
respondent's
doctors
when
they
--
until
the
day
they
testified
in
the
court.
all
these
then
comes
to
as
picture.
the
trial
judge
charged
that
the
jury
may
on
negligence
as
well
as
on
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
find
for
the
plaintiff
if
they
found
there
was
a
failure
to
provide
railings
or
other
safety
devices.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
because
in
the
majority
opinion
written
by
judge
watkins
concurring
by
judge
friendly,
judge
smith
dissenting,
the
plaintiff
had
the
burden
to
show
by
a
marine
expert
whether
it
was
feasible
to
construct
a
railing
or
other
safety
device.
and
further,
they
said
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that
a
railing
or
other
safety
device
was
necessary
under
the
circumstances.
well,
clearly,
with
respect
to
the
second
part
of
this
disjunctive
reasoning
of
reversal,
the
testimony
by
terry
and
trible
who
were
the
other
lookout
seamen
was
that
there
was
nothing
to
grab
of
hold
of,
nothing
to
bridge
with
over
that
space
that
the
bulky
radar
enclosure
was
too
big
and
that
it
wasn't
safe.
the
testimony
of
witnesses
clearly
showed
that
there
was
a
need
for
it.
so
the
basic
issue
as
i
see
it
here
is
this.
in
all
future
trials
in
maritime
cases,
is
it
required
that
a
seaman
produce
an
expert
to
prove
to
a
jury
that
something
he
claims
was
unseaworthy
or
unsafe
could
have
feasibly
been
safe
or
made
safe
by
construction
or
otherwise.
in
other
words,
if
there
was
a
defective
piece
of
rope,
a
simple
thing
like
that
and
the
plaintiff
says,
“that
rope
parted”,
can
he
succeed
now
unless
he
shows
by
an
expert
that
feasibly
they
could
have
made
a
good
piece
of
rope.
i
say
the
issue
was
that
simple
because
we
are
here
concerned
with
an
open
hole
in
complete
darkness
in
a
vibrating
tower
and
to
say
that
a
lifeline
or
a
platform
with
skid
proof
paint
or
bulbs
that
should
have
not
blown
out
the
anti-vibration
bulbs
are
subjects
of
expert
testimony
is
the
equivalent
of
saying
that
a
jury
is
not
fit
to
pass
on
a
simple
factual
issue.
and
now,
i
turn
to
the
test
as
i
see
it,
as
annunciated
by
this
court
in
the
winans
case
and
in
the
kellogg
case
and
also
set
down
by
leading
text
on
the
subject
of
expert
testimony
what
are
the
tests
to
determine
that
should
go
to
a
jury
without
expert
testimony
and
that
which
a
jury
composed
of
a
lay
and
uneducated
mind
can
properly
determine
in
the
absence
of
an
expert?
well,
you
don't
produce
experts
when
you
have
ordinary
standards
of
conduct
of
safety
or
danger.
you
don't
need
an
expert
when
there's
an
operation
of
well-known
natural
laws.
you
don't
need
an
expert
when
there's
an
existence
of
a
custom.
you
don't
need
an
expert
even
though
the
expert
may
know
more
of
the
subject
than
the
juror
himself.
and
this
court
stated
in
the
milwaukee
against
kellogg
case
of
94
supreme
court,
it
is
a
matter
of
observation
on
which
the
lay
mind
is
capable
of
forming
a
judgment
that
determines
whether
or
not
you
need
an
expert.
i
respectfully
submit
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
ladder,
with
an
open
hole,
the
lay
juror
has
had
enough
experience
with
ladders
and
with
openings
that
will
drop
31
feet
to
be
capable
of
forming
its
own
judgment
on
whether
that
condition
was
safe
or
unsafe
and
whether
there
should
have
been
a
railing
or
not.
and
it
was
not
a
subject
that
would
require
the
tampering
and
the
invasion
of
a
juror's
function
by
pitting
experts
against
experts
to
delay
the
judicial
process
and
confuse
it.
the
issue
now
turns
to
the
second
point
on
certiorari
and
that
is
future
maintenance.
the
trial
judge
by
consent
of
the
parties
gave
salem
three
additional
years
--
mr.
robert
klonsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
klonsky
it
was
argued
in
the
sense
of
saying
that
it
was
an
unsafe
place
without
a
railing,
without
a
line
or
something
in
summations.
we
did
contend
that
there
should
have
been
something
to
allow
him
to
safely
bridge
over
the
space.
mr.
robert
klonsky
the
nature
of
it
in
summation,
it
was
argued.
it
was
also
a
contention
in
our
pleadings
that
he
was
not
supplied
with
proper
pertinences
and
appliances
to
perform
his
work
safely.
there
certainly
was
argument
and
there
was
a
strong
contention
that
this
platform
which
was
--
went
with
the
temperature
difference
between
the
inside
and
the
outside
of
the
tower
and
its
one
condition
as
testified
too
by
the
two
witnesses
should
have
had
skid
proof
paint.
it
was
contended
that
these
lights
which
were
going
out
all
the
time
should
have
been
anti
vibration
and
different
in
the
household
bulb
that
they
used.
and
these
are
all
items
of
safety
devices
which
were
not
provided
and
were
subjects
of
argument
and
presentation
of
proof
in
court.
now
throughout
its
brief,
the
respondent
asks
us,
what
other
safety
devices
you
are
talking
about.
and
in
our
answering
briefs,
we
keep
telling
them,
a
guideline
or
a
lifeline,
even
a
simple
flashlight
to
see
your
way
when
you
know
foreseeably
the
lights
inside
this
tower
are
no
good.
now,
you
would
need
this
anti-skid
paint.
we
tell
them
that.
we
argue
that
and
i
might
say
this.
the
briefs
of
respondent,
as
i
see
them,
represent
re-arguments
that
--
of
issues
they
presented
to
the
jury
in
the
same
fashion
which
was
rejected
by
the
jury.
this
is
a
jones
act
jury
we're
talking
about.
it
has
a
function
that
this
court
has
held
to
be
in
violet
for
many,
many,
many
decades
of
decisions.
now
to
come
here
and
say
that
because
the
man
could
have
stretched
his
arms
out
and
clothe
these
thin
stiffeners
and
thereby
held
on
an
absolute
darkness
or
that
he
gave
a
different
version
while
under
gross
sedation
on
the
ship
as
to
what
occurred.
these
were
all
told
to
the
jury.
they
resolved
the
facts.
they
resolved
the
facts
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
i
might
also
say
that
contentions
of
other
errors
were
also
considered
by
the
majority
and
found
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
they
found
a
contention
of
error
with
respect
to
negligent
rescue,
they
found
to
the
plaintiff.
the
obligation
of
the
seaman
to
report
and
knowing
dangerous
condition,
they
filed
for
the
plaintiff.
so
what
remains
is
that
the
majority
said
here
is
a
general
verdict
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
if
the
judge
had
posed
special
interrogatories
because
then,
if
the
special
interrogatory
would
have
been
answered
by
the
jury,
to
state
yes,
there
was
negligence
on
the
part
of
richards,
who
left
him
there
dangling
in
open
space
while
confused
and
injured.
oh,
yes,
if
they
found
there
was
negligence
occurred
to
provide
adequate
lights
which
kept
going
off,
while
then
the
verdict
would
have
been
sustained,
i
respectfully
submit,
neither
party
asked
the
special
interrogatories.
the
judge,
in
his
discretion,
did
not
think
special
interrogatory
should
have
been
propounded,
just
as
that
his
discretion
he
did
nothing,
an
expert
was
necessary.
in
light
of
this,
if
there's
substantial
evidence
on
some
of
the
issues
presented,
then
why
suddenly
out
of
the
void,
not
even
made
part
of
the
oral
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals,
should
this
question
of
an
expert
be
the
basis
of
a
reversal
on
a
remand
after
seven
days
of
trial
and
this
is
a
second
trial
incidentally
because
the
first
one
ended
in
mistrial.
mr.
robert
klonsky
it
was
not
even
argued.
no
judge
asked
the
question
about
expert
testimony.
it
was
only
mentioned
in
passing
in
the
briefs
and
i
might
state
this,
your
honors,
that
when
we
moved
for
a
petition
for
rehearing,
it
was
denied.
we
also
moved
for
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
and
the
court
of
appeals
then
constituted
of
six
judges
were
split
three
to
three
on
whether
there
was
need
for
an
expert
on
such
issues
of
obvious
danger.
accordingly,
we
have
to
come
here
because
if
we
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
decided
to
proceed
without
an
expert
as
we
had
before
while
maybe
the
majority
would
consist
of
the
three
who
said
we
should
have
had
one
or
vice
versa.
so
there
is
a
need,
of
course,
in
the
resolution
of
this
issue
not
only
for
this
case
as
i
just
indicated,
but
for
all
maritime
cases
to
ascertain
whether
from
now
on,
on
all
issues
of
maritime
architecture,
any
simple
issue
of
obvious
danger
that
can
be
a
trial
with
or
without
an
expert
and
this
court
in
its
past
decisions
on
experts
have
shown
how
they
can
delay
trial,
how
they're
unnecessary
on
simple
issues,
how
the
lay
mind
can
determine
things
of
this
nature
and
even
where
experts
know
more
as
long
as
the
issue
wasn't
so
complex
and
technical,
it
is
still
preferred
not
to
have
experts.
now
let's
go
on
to
the
maintenance
cause,
if
i
may.
this
--
mr.
robert
klonsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
klonsky
overwhelming,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
klonsky
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
klonsky
the
defendant
never
offered
an
expert
either.
and
i
would
think
this.
if
your
honor
would
read
the
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
smith,
if
ever
there
should
be
an
issue
of
whether
a
certain
item
of
danger
could
be
feasibly
corrected
or
constructed,
that
should
be
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
show
they
could
not
feasibly
have
corrected
something.
the
jury
found
it
unsafe.
they
say,
“all
right,
it's
unsafe
but
we
could
not
have
feasibly
corrected
it,
but
that
was
their
burden,
not
our
burden.
our
burden
under
the
law,
as
we
see
it,
is
merely
to
show
an
unsafe
place
to
work,
breach
of
warranty
of
seaworthiness
which
is
absolute
continuing
non-delegable
as
this
court
had
stated
for
so
many
years.
and
it's
an
upfront
to
this
court
when
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
believe
that
a
constitutionally
determined
jury
question
in
the
jones
act
case
is
beyond
the
kin
of
a
jury
to
decide
on
such
a
simple
issue
as
that.
it
is
not
a
sufficiency
of
evidence
case.
it's
whether
there
are
any
weight
that
could
be
given
to
proof
which
is
not
tampered
by
an
expert's
testimony
on
a
simple
issue.
now
if
i
may,
can
i
go
to
the
maintenance
question?
the
court
on
consent
of
the
parties
passed
on
past
and
future
maintenance.
there
was
no
question
on
the
past
maintenance
because
it
was
affirmed.
future
maintenance
was
for
three
years.
it
was
held
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
might
state
on
this
the
three
judges
were
unanimous.
that
there
was
not
enough
proof
in
the
record
as
to
a
specific
need
in
the
discretion
of
this
judge
for
a
three-year
period
of
future
maintenance.
and
they
point
to
the
fact
that
there
is
testimony
by
doctors
as
to
the
fact
that
he
will
get
worse
in
the
future,
that
he
would
maybe
in
need
of
further
treatment
that
he
was
still
going
to
a
rehabilitation
program,
but
that
no
doctors
specifically
said
three
years
in
the
future.
i
respectfully
submit
to
your
honors
that
in
the
light
of
your
sentilia
decision
which
only
recently
came
down
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
trial
court
to
resolve
issues
of
a
medical
prognosis
and
diagnosis
only
on
a
specific
support
of
a
doctor
who
testifies.
he
can
draw
his
necessary
and
reasonable
conclusion
from
such
medical
testimony.
and
after
looking
at
the
voluminous
hospital
records
and
after
hearing
these
doctors
who
came
into
court
to
testify
and
looking
at
the
ship's
hospital
records
which
have
been
kept
away
from
their
own
doctors
until
they
did
testify,
he
concluded
and
he
sets
this
forth
orally
on
the
record
that
from
all
this
testimony,
i
feel
this
poor
seaman
deserves
three
additional
years
of
maintenance
from
this
day.
it
is
attacked
from
the
ground
that
it
does
not
specifically
set
forth
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
was
no
provision
that
there
was
a
specific
form
prescribed
for
setting
this
for.
he
gives
his
reasons,
they
are
set
forth
rather
clearly
in
the
record
and
--
mr.
robert
klonsky
that
your
honor
would
be
found
on
--
mr.
robert
klonsky
wait.
i
have
–
that
is
on
page
139,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
klonsky
and
he
sets
it
forth,
i
think
rather
concisely,
without
going
into
too
much
detail,
he
states
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
poor
man
ever
since
the
accident
in
1958
has
been
trying
to
get
relief
from
this
condition,
trying
to
get
some
assistance
to
get
well,
to
get
on
his
feet
and
et
cetera,
and
he
concluded
at
this
time
my
judgment
is
three
years
as
a
reasonable
time
within
which
to
anticipate
that
he's
going
to
need
it
and
i'm
going
to
allow
it
upon
that
basis,
on
the
basis
of
$8
a
day
which
was
a
stipulated
amount.
here
is
a
problem
that
arises
from
this
court
of
appeals
decision
on
maintenance.
the
majority
opinion
by
judge
watkins
says,
it
seems
that
the
supreme
court
has
stated
--
i
see
a
white
light.
oh,
i'm
going
to
sit
down.
the
supreme
court
has
stated
–
mr.
robert
klonsky
pardon
sir?
mr.
robert
klonsky
i
want
some
time
for
rebuttal
your
honor.
mr.
robert
klonsky
the
supreme
court
has
stated
that
there's
no
future
maintenance
ever
to
be
granted
for
a
seaman.
and
i
respectfully
submit
the
supreme
court
has
never
said
that.
mr.
robert
klonsky
i'm
concluded
now.
i
will
have
another
ten
minutes
later.
mr.
robert
klonsky
to
respond
directly,
your
honors,
to
the
last
point,
of
course
if
there's
anything
seriously
erroneous
about
an
instruction
although
there
was
other
evidence
to
support
the
verdict,
it
should
go
back,
but
the
error
contended
here
is
one
related
to
railing
or
other
safety
devices.
this
was
clear
from
the
record
and
the
testimony
of
defendant's
own
witnesses
as
well
as
ours.
if
it
was
wrong
to
pose
this
even,
i
would
say
that's
on
the
harmless
error
of
rule
61,
it
could
not
be
considered
germane
or
be
pertinent
here.
the
major
issue
as
i
see
it
is
this.
does
the
requirement
of
a
rope,
the
requirement
of
a
rail,
around
an
open
hole
of
such
a
complex
and
technical
nature
that
only
an
expert
could
testify
on
it
that
is
the
issue.
and
if
a
jury
is
told
that
they
must
have
an
expert
to
dilute
their
jones
act
function
in
such
a
simple
issue,
it
will
be
on
every
other.
you
will
have
protracted
trials,
you
will
have
your
delays,
you'll
have
your
experts
pitted
against
experts.
there's
a
very
real
danger
in
this
particular
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals
downstairs.
and
as
i
told
the
court
at
the
beginning,
there
is
a
disjunctive
reasoning
here
as
to
why
the
reversal
was
granted.
the
first
thing,
the
feasibility
of
construction,
of
course,
there
is
no
question
of
a
line
being
part
of
a
construction
item,
but
the
feasibility
of
construction
and
the
need.
well,
we
had
the
testimony
by
long
experience
seamen,
trible
and
terry.
trible
himself
had
a
second
mate's
license.
they
are
part
of
the
record.
for
example,
this
is
what
was
stated
by
the
first
witness.
i
think
his
name
was
trible.
he
says,
no,
this
rectangular
pipe
that
we
spoke
about
where
the
radar
cable
ran
through
and
which
is
marked
in
plaintiff
exhibit
2
for
identification,
did
you
ever
use
that
as
a
hand
hold,
that
being
the
only
one
available?
answer,
no.
did
you
ever
grab
it?
no.
why
not?
well,
because
i
don't
ever
grab
hold
of
anything
that
has
electrical
current
going
through
plus
the
fact
that
it
was
too
big
to
grab
hold
of.
and
then
the
other
witness,
terry,
who
had
88
times
for
each
voyage
going
up
and
down
this
ladder
who
have
been
on
a
160
or
188
voyages
on
the
vessel
who
knew
this
particular
vessel
better
than
any
one
else
who
could
possibly
be
called
from
the
outside
and
he
said,
“question,
the
crow's-nest
platform,
was
there
a
railing
to
grab
a
hold
of?
answer,
the
platform
level
when
you
go
in
the
crow's-nest
question.
yes.
answer,
there
is
no
special
railing
there,
regular
construction
of
the
crow's-nest.
question,
what
is
a
lifeline?
answer,
safety
measure,
to
grab
hold
on
to
protect
yourself
until
you
are
safe.
question,
were
there
any
lifelines
at
this
platform
level
when
you
left
the
crow's-nest
on
february
15,
1958?
and
with
respect
to
the
chief
judge's
request
about
the
platform
itself
on
page
159,
richards,
he
being
the
relief
man
who
left
the
plaintiff
fit
on
this
ledge
to
fall
again,
question,
the
platform
itself
on
which
the
accident
happened,
what
was
its
condition
on
a
daily
accident?
answer,
what
are
you
–
what
are
you
referring
to
by
condition?
question,
were
there
any
rising,
any
preparations,
any
diamonds
to
catch
or
put
to
protect
it
from
slipping?
answer,
it
is
a
steel
plate.
there
are
no
preparations.
it
is
smooth.
question,
was
there
any
skid
proof
paint
or
anything
like
that
on
it.
and
mr.
connor
wants
you
to
say
that
because
for
eight
years
there
was
no
accident
on
this
particular
platform,
therefore,
you
should
deem
it
safe
but
for
eight
years,
the
light
didn't
go
out
simultaneously.
i
believe
this
man
in
complete
pitched
darkness
and
he
says
he
should
have
raised
his
arms
so
he
could
have
held
onto
the
sides,
but
the
testimony
is
clear
that
he
didn't
have
time
yet
to
raise
his
hands
and
besides
he
was
scared,
he
was
scared
right
there
and
he
slipped
on
this
one
smooth
platform
and
fell
backwards.
he
had
nothing
to
guide
him
in
pitch-darkness
from
this
ladder
to
the
point
where
he
fell.
true,
he
didn't
fall
until
he
got
both
feet
on
the
platform,
but
he
started
from
that
ladder
when
the
lights
all
went
out.
and
when
mr.
connor
talks
of
one
light,
i
wish
your
honors
to
remember,
there
were
five
lights
in
that
tower,
five
lights
were
out
at
the
time.
it
was
a
condition
that
was
known
for
months
before
with
respect
to
the
two
upper
lights
that
would
have
cast
some
illumination
and
five
days
before
this
accident,
they
had
tried
to
fix
the
two
lower
lights.
this
wasn't
ordinary
bulbs
blowing
out
because
of
use.
it's
because
there
was
such
excess
of
vibration.
they
did
not
use
proper
lights
and
proper
electrical
conditions
to
protect
the
men
that
work
in
that
tower.
there
are
multiple
conditions
of
fault
here
but
all
simple,
all
obvious.
now
--
mr.
robert
klonsky
i
think
so,
sir
on
any.
mr.
robert
klonsky
i
think
so,
sir
on
any.
i
think
so
sir
and
if
your
honor
would
read
the
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
smith,
he
points
out
that
on
the
broad
field
of
naval
architecture
in
any
respect
if
that
majority
opinion
is
to
be
followed,
you
must
have
an
expert
and
that
is
why
judge
clark
dissented
too.
mr.
robert
klonsky
not
if
you
would
please,
your
honor.
i
would
say
it
was
of
any
pertinence
or
appliance
of
the
vessel
with
respect
to
its
construction
or
fitness
for
use
and
not
a
condition
such
as
grace
which
is
a
transitory
thing
that
could
be
cleaned
up,
but
your
honor
has
before
him
judge
smith's
dissenting
opinion
and
he
very
clearly
said
that
from
this
opinion
it
must
appear,
majority
that
is,
that
now
on,
on
all
simple
issues
in
the
broad
field
of
naval
architecture
touching
on
anything,
we
must
now
have
an
expert
and
that
is
why
judge
--
mr.
robert
klonsky
the
kind
of
a
ladder
you
would
need,
yes,
i
would
think
you'd
need
an
expert
now
if
the
majority
opinion
stands.
it
is
very
broad
and
it
applies
to
things
which
are
not
complex
or
technical
because
certainly
a
hand
line
or
a
hand
hold
or
a
simple
rail
around
an
opening
is
not
complex
or
technical.
so
if
you
use
that
as
an
analogy,
it
must
pertain
to
any
other
appliance
or
pertinence
that
maybe
involved
in
any
case.
does
this
white
light
represent
my
time?
mr.
robert
klonsky
oh,
i
see,
sir.
mr.
robert
klonsky
and
this
mock
up
that
was
referred
to
by
mr.
connor
that
the
court
properly
did
not
allow
an
evidence.
it
was
made
of
wood.
it
was
deceptive
because
it
didn't
show
the
31-foot
drop.
it
had
certain
parts
in
it
which
were
not
the
same
as
the
original.
the
best
things
in
evidence
were
these
photographs
that
were
taken
by
the
defendant
and
the
diagrams.
i
know
they
don't
like
the
photographs
because
this
so
graphically
portrays
the
dangers
involved
here
and
the
need
for
the
use
of
all
sensory
perception
to
get
from
that
ladder
onto
the
platform.
i
ask,
your
honors,
to
look
at
these
photographs.
they
are
now
in
mr.
connor's
possession.
look
at
the
diagram
so
you
can
see
the
need
for
saying
that
under
these
obvious
conditions
of
danger,
there
was
no
necessity
for
an
expert.
mr.
robert
klonsky
yes
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
it
is.
i
assume
it
is.
mr.
robert
klonsky
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
you
do,
but
i
can't
be
sure.
should
i
check
later
with
the
clerk?
mr.
robert
klonsky
yes,
i
would
have
filed
it
through
the
court
of
appeals
everything
they
had
was
supposed
to
come
here.
if
they
have
sent
that,
i'm
not
sure
personally
because
i
didn't
send
it.
mr.
robert
klonsky
your
honor,
it's
unusual
for
any
other
ship
but
this
ship.
this
ship
is
a
record
breaking
speed
ship.
mr.
robert
klonsky
about
eight
and
a
half
years
before
the
accident
your
honor.
mr.
robert
klonsky
none
of
these
things
happened
before
--
you
mean
all
the
lights
going
out
at
once,
that
is
true
as
far
as
i
know
inside
the
radar
tower.
mr.
robert
klonsky
yes,
your
honor.
no,
for
all
trips
of
this
ship
has
compared
to
any
other
ship.
mr.
robert
klonsky
well,
all
of
them
didn't
go
out
previously
at
one
time.
previously
lights
went
out
constantly,
but
this
time
they
had
four
out
since
12:30
and
the
fifth
one
went
out
just
as
he
was
bridging.
mr.
robert
klonsky
not
for
this
trip,
no.
but
there
is
evidence
on
the
chief
porter
master
that
this
ship
had
more
vibration
than
any
other
because
of
its
speed.
mr.
robert
klonsky
perhaps,
your
honor,
yes
and
it
also
requires
certain
measures
that
they
did
not
take.
one
of
them
to
have
a
lifeline
or
a
hand
hold
so
the
man
could
safely
bridge
over
this
tower
which
is
right
in
the
forward
part
of
the
ship
and
it's
the
most
susceptible
to
this
vibration,
and
i
might
say
this.
mr.
connor
points
out
that
this
radar
tower
in
the
crow's-nest
is
unusual.
you
don't
find
it
in
other
ships.
well,
if
it's
so
unusual
then
the
only
expert
we
could
have
gotten
to
testify
about
it
would
be
an
expert
who
had
something
to
do
with
manufacturing
that
radar
tower
and
that
crow's-nest.
and
i
don't
think
that
he'll
come
and
say
that
the
mastermind
of
his
own
creation
should
be
the
subject
of
criticism
by
human
favoring
the
plaintiff
and
his
testimony.
now
if
we
--
mr.
robert
klonsky
(inaudible)
your
honor?
mr.
robert
klonsky
no,
i
have
no
known
case
before
martin
(inaudible).
this
is
the
recent
expression
of
the
recent
court
about
the
further
burdens
imposed
upon
a
plaintiff,
a
greater
burden
of
proof
negligence
than
they
ever
had
before
and
i
think
it
is
a
use
of
patient
of
a
jones
act
jury's
function
to
be
independent
in
their
determination
of
facts
in
a
lawsuit
and
when
you
impose
an
expert
to
tamper
their
judgment
while
you
have
done
away
with
one
of
the
fundamental
constitutional
rights
for
seaman.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
klonsky
i
have
no
objection,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
klonsky
oh,
i'd
like
it
very
much
to
see
them,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
klonsky
then
