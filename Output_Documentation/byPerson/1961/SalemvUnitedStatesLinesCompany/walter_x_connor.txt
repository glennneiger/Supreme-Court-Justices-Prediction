mr.
walter
x.
connor
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
can
see
that
i'm
here
on
two
questions
and
only
two,
other
matters
were
argued
to
your
honors
this
morning
many
of
which
i
am
in
disagreement
with
respect
to
what
the
facts
were
as
developed
on
the
trial,
but
as
i
understand
it,
i
have
to
argue
a
case
as
to
whether
or
not
in
the
seaman's
action
where
a
charge
is
made
that
the
ship
is
defectively
constructed,
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
an
expert
testimony
to
support
that,
or
to
say
it
in
other
way,
is
this
sufficient
where
a
shipowner
shows
that
over
a
period
of
eight
years,
its
particular
part
of
the
vessel
is
safe
that
the
plaintiff
may
come
in
without
any
evidence
with
respect
to
the
architecture
of
the
place
and
merely
say
that
there
was
no
railing
and
therefore,
have
a
jury
verdict.
now
the
other
point
of
course
is
the
maintenance
point.
to
deal
first
with
the
conditions
in
that
area,
i
think
if
i
may,
this
is
an
exhibit
which
we
had
on
the
trial,
it
maybe
somewhat
helpful
to
your
honors,
i
don't
know
whether
you
can
see
it
very
well,
but
in
any
event
it's
kind
of
a
bird's
--
mr.
walter
x.
connor
yes
sir.
it's
kind
of
a
bird's
eye
view
part
of
the
main
deck
and
as
your
honors
will
notice
that
this
area,
there's
a
silvery
column
which
arises
from
the
deck
and
that
is
the
radar
tower
at
the
very
top
of
it,
some
60
feet
off
is
the
radar
screen.
i
will
scope
and
further
down,
you'll
see
a
little
projection
from
the
tower
and
that's
where
the
crow's-nest
is
located.
now
the
crow's-nest
on
the
united
states
is
substantially
different
than
any
other
crow's-nest.
i
think
we're
all
familiar
with
the
type
of
crow's-nest
which
is
exposed
to
the
elements.
it's
on
the
forward
part
of
the
ship.
it's
attached
to
the
fore
mast.
there's
a
straight
up
and
down
ladder
that
leads
to
it
and
there's
usually
a
basket
light
that
lies
at
the
top
of
it
which
is
entered
through
a
trap
door.
now
contrary
to
that
on
the
united
states,
the
lookouts
could
go
to
their
lookout
station
without
having
to
face
the
elements.
now
bear
in
mind
that
in
the
first
type
of
ladder
that
i
described,
a
seaman
had
to
climb
that
in
the
dark
because
there's
no
lights
allowed
on
forward
(inaudible)
there
is
a
simple
iron
ladder
with
no
platforms,
no
rest
--
resting
places
where
the
seaman
of
the
–
of
the
–
if
there's
a
snow
on
the
ladder
or
if
rain
is
falling,
your
ship
is
rolling,
he
still
must
ascend
that
ladder.
now
on
the
united
states,
all
that
danger
was
removed.
there
was
a
ladder
enclosed.
the
seaman
was
not
affected
by
the
weather.
if
climbing
up
to
three
flights
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
or
the
separations,
the
first
platform
was
about
11
feet
off
the
deck
and
then
the
rest
of
them
a
little
better
than
5
feet.
if
he
chose,
he
could
step
off
there
and
rest
instead
of
climbing
the
30
somewhat
feet
which
would
bring
him
to
his
station.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
the
first
one
was
on
a
slant
from
the
deck
but
not
very
much
of
a
slant,
almost
vertical,
the
rest
of
it
is
vertical
and
these
platforms
are
steel
and
they
have
an
opening,
which
will
admit
a
human
being.
now
--
mr.
walter
x.
connor
i
have
some
here
your
honor.
yes
sir.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
yes.
now
i
have
to
say
however
that
i'm
not
very
happy
with
the
pictures
because
this
is
a
very
tight
space.
it's
only
46
inches
at
its
widest
part
and
its
only
36
inches
at
its
narrowest
part
and
it's
just
about
seven
feet,
fore
and
aft.
so
it
was
very
difficult
to
take
photographs
but
i
have
them
and
while
i
am
on
that
subject
i
might
mention
that
i
had
built
an
exact
size
mock
up
of
this
particular
area
of
the
crow's-nest.
in
other
words,
it's
exactly
the
size.
i
have
photographs
of
it
here
but
they
didn't
get
any
evidence
though
nor
did
the
mock
up
get
into
evidence.
in
other
words,
what
i
wanted
to
show
to
the
jury
and
i
was
forbidden
from
doing
so
by
the
court's
ruling
out
this
evidence,
although
on
the
prior
trial,
the
judge
had
allowed
it
in,
the
jurors
could
have
looked
at
this
mock
up
tower
and
seen
what
the
space
was
and
seen
what
there
was
in
that
area.
now
the
contention
is
made
here
that
in
this
vacuum
in
which
the
jury
was
acting,
it
could
make
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
should
have
been
some
handrails
and
that's
the
only
contention
the
plaintiff
made,
was
handrails.
the
safety
devices
got
into
the
case
on
the
charge
and
that's
one
of
the
things
to
which
i
took
objection
because
the
very
expression
safety
devices
implies
that
there
was
something
there
–
that
there
was
something
missing
that
would
have
made
this
man's
journey
safe.
now
let's
talk
about
the
lights
and
bulbs.
it's
not
part
of
this
case
at
all.
we're
not
dealing
with
it
here,
but
i
have
to
refer
to
it
only
to
point
out
that
it's
quite
true
that
the
light
at
this
particular
platform
went
out
just
prior
to
the
accident
but
it
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
–
with
the
plaintiff's
fault
and
i'll
explain
that
in
a
minute,
but
something
was
said
here
for
example
about
heavy
duty
bulbs
as
compared
to
ordinary
household
bulbs.
well,
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
case
whatsoever
that
any
other
type
of
bulbs
would
have
been
better
than
the
bulbs
which
were
being
used.
this
is
a
vessel
that
goes
to
sea,
it's
not
a
home
and
a
bulb
burn
out
as
the
testimony
showed,
but
in
any
event,
i
suspect
that
the
problem
arises
here
because
of
a
misconception
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
how
it
is
that
the
plaintiff
had
his
accident.
now
i
think
you
might
justify
and
may
be
infer
from
what
the
plaintiff's
counsel
said
to
you
this
morning
that
the
plaintiff
fell
while
he
was
stepping
from
this
ladder
in
the
dark.
well,
that's
not
so
at
all.
now
the
record
on
page
--
in
my
brief
rather,
on
pages
4
and
5
quote
the
testimony
of
exactly
what
happened.
the
plaintiff
testified
that
he
had
ascended
this
ladder
and
incidentally
he
had
done
it
hundreds
of
times,
he'd
been
doing
his
lookout
work
for
over
a
year
and
he
said
he
got
up
to
the
rung
of
the
ladder
from
which
he
normally
stepped
off
and
his
practice
was
to
back
off,
take
hold
of
a
radar
casing
which
was
right
at
hand
and
then
swing
around
and
walk
the
necessary
three
steps
to
the
crow's-nest,
that's
all
it
was.
it
was
no
more
than
about
three
steps.
so
he
–
as
he
was
taking
his
second
foot
off
the
ladder,
this
light
went
out
and
he
then
turned
around
and
was
facing
towards
the
crow's-nest
where
he
had
to
go
and
had
taken
one
step
forward
away
from
the
hole
and
he
was
about
to
take
the
second
step
when
for
reasons
which
do
not
appear
in
the
record,
he
fell
and
he
was
found
later
on
in
this
access
hole
to
the
ladder.
now
i
think
that
in
the
dissent
by
judge
smith,
he
conceived
that
the
accident
happened
as
the
plaintiff
was
stepping
from
the
ladder
onto
the
platform.
now,
in
that
crow's-nest,
at
shoulder
length,
at
shoulder
height
of
the
plaintiff
anyway,
there
was
a
steel
ledge
that
went
around
the
inside
and
all
that
mr.
salem
had
to
do
if
he
want
to
maintain
his
balance
and
he
doesn't
say
he
lost
it,
indeed,
he
said
he
never
had
any
trouble
with
this
area
before.
the
other
seaman
who
testified
before
him
said
that
they
never
had
any
trouble.
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
extend
his
arms
and
he
could
have
maintained
himself
and
walk
right
to
the
crow's-nest
where
there
was
another
man
in
there.
now
it's
true
it
was
dark
but
he
should
have
known
the
area
and
the
reason
it
was
dark
was
because
he,
among
other
things,
had
failed
to
perform
his
duty.
now
you
were
told
here
that
they
were
--
an
attempt
was
made
to
repair
the
electric
wires,
well
that
was
not
so
at
all.
there
was
a
–
there
was
a
repair
and
it
was
effective.
what
happened
here
were
these
lights
burned
out
as
bulbs
do
and
the
testimony
is
clear
enough,
but
i
should
say
that's
not
part
of
the
case
and
i
only
mention
it
to
indicate
that
--
or
to
reply
to
some
of
the
things
that
was
said
to
you
this
morning
and
i
certainly
don't
like
to
trespass
on
my
time
to
do
so.
but
in
any
event,
it
was
the
plaintiff's
duty
as
a
lookout
to
report
the
absence
of
any
lights.
now
he
says
that
when
he
started
to
work
at
midnight,
two
lights
were
out,
the
light
was
burning
up
at
the
level
of
the
crow's-nest.
he
served
two
hours
at
lookout.
he
went
down
the
ladder
and
the
two
lights
were
still
out
and
no
report
from
him.
he
has
a
telephone
right
there
in
the
crow's-nest,
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
telephone
the
bridge
and
the
bridge
would
telephone
the
engine
room,
the
engine
room
keeps
on
hand,
an
electrician
whose
job
it
is
to
replace
lights.
that's
his
–
that's
his
function.
so
the
plaintiff
merely
had
to
pick
up
his
telephone
and
notify
the
bridge,
there
are
some
lights
out
and
lights
would
have
been
furnished.
but
he
didn't
do
it
and
then
he
violated
his
duty
and
i
–
we
are
charged
that
he
was
guilty
of
negligence
because
it
maybe
brought
about
his
own
accident,
but
now
we
get
back
to
what's
really
an
issue
here.
is
it
enough
for
the
plaintiff
to
have
some
witness
say
in
a
particular
area
and
that's
unique,
there
was
no
handrail?
is
it
proper
in
the
circumstances
for
the
trial
judge
to
add
that
and
say
safety
devices?
now
you've
been
told
on
--
by
plaintiff's
argument
that
we
did
not
mentioned
the
matter
of
experts
on
the
argument
below
and
say
we
made
some
mention
of
it
in
our
brief.
well
that
was
really
the
important
things
of
the
brief
and
i
don't
think
i
did
get
to
argue.
i
was
allowed
20
minutes
to
argue
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
just
didn't
get
around
to
it.
i
was
stopped.
after
i
had
only
begun
my
argument.
i
think
that
in
this
case
there
were
some
80
prejudicial
ruling
as
against
the
defendant
on
the
admission
or
rejection
of
evidence
or
remarks
by
the
court
which
were
highly
prejudicial
to
the
defendant,
those
are
some
of
the
areas
that
we
complained
about
and
i
only
gotten
through
talking
about
them
when
the
presiding
judge
said
your
time's
up.
now
it's
also
said
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
brief,
in
this
court
on
page
25
--
mr.
walter
x.
connor
the
respondent
did
not
offer
an
expert
unable
architect
nor
was
there
any
contention
recorded
by
petitioner,
respondent
by
the
petitioner
was
so
recorded
on
clear
and
simple
issues
involved,
neither
did
the
trial
court
in
its
discretion.
now
on
page
111
of
the
record,
as
i
was
discussing
before
the
charge
was
actually
given,
so
many
aspects
of
what
the
court
said
he
was
to
say,
i
said
that
i
would
take
exemption
to
any
issue
of
being
submitted
to
the
jury
in
respect
of
handrails
or
hand
grips
or
lifelines
in
that
radar
tower
because
there
has
been
no
evidence
or
whatever
that
such
handrails
or
lifelines
are
proper
for
such
an
area.
it
is
a
small
enclosure
where
the
widest
part
is
four
feet,
the
narrowest
is
three
feet.
there
was
no
expert
that
has
been
called
here
to
testify
that
under
such
circumstances,
in
such
a
ship
as
this,
there
should
be
any
such
thing
as
handrails
and
lifelines.
so
there
isn't
any
question
about
the
fact
of
the
matter
of
the
lack
of
expert
evidence
was
right
there
in
the
trial
all
the
time
and
i
don't
understand
the
statement
made
that
we
did
--
it
wasn't
done.
now
the
court
of
appeals
determined
in
accordance
with
two
previous
decisions
of
it
that
with
respect
to
matters
dealing
with
naval
architecture,
if
a
plan
was
made
that
the
architecture
of
the
vessel
was
wrong
and
defective,
there
had
to
be
some
proof
of
it
and
that
the
jury
could
not
decide
that
matter
for
itself.
there
was
some
disparagement
of
experts
here
by
plaintiff's
counsel
but
he
himself
used
experts
and
i
don't
think
he
may
use
the
disparaged
experts
in
general
because
they
disagree
with
one
another
because
that's
what
happened
here.
he
introduced
two
expert
doctors,
(inaudible),
both
of
them
disagreed
as
to
whether
the
plaintiff
was
injured
or
not,
seriously
and
permanently
injured
i
mean.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
well,
it
happens
in
railroads
cases
which
i've
indicated
the
same
thing
if
your
honor
pleases
and
you
know
--
mr.
walter
x.
connor
well,
no.
they
said
this
and
i
have
--
i
haven't
--
i
don't
have
it
mentioned
in
my
brief,
if
your
honor
pleases,
but
since
you
asked
a
question,
i
can
say
that
there
is
a
case
of
davis
against
louisville
and
nashville
railroad
company
which
is
at
75
f.2d
849,
a
1935
decision
which
says,
reasonable
engineering
and
scientific
judgment
used
by
a
mast,
and
now
we're
talking
about
railroad,
is
not
the
subject
–
is
not
subject
to
a
review
by
a
jury
and
there's
another
case,
housen
against
southern
railway
to
the
same
effect.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
walter
x.
connor
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor,
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
matter
of
–
here
the
shipowner
has
proven
that
the
place
is
safe.
it
had
proven
that
over
eight
and
a
half
years
there's
never
been
an
accident
there.
there's
never
been
any
need
for
this
–
for
a
handrail
and
there's
never
been
any
need
for
whatever
safety
devices
or
i
don't
know
because
i
say
that's
what
the
trial
court
used
in
one
of
the
areas
which
we
charged
below.
i
don't
know
what
safety
devices
mean
but
is
it
enough
for
a
seaman
to
walk
in
the
court
and
say
there
wasn't
a
handrail?
well,
he
could
have
said
there
was
no
nurse
maid
there
too.
should
we
rent
a
nurse
maid?
it's
a
problem.
i
don't
mean
to
be
fictitious.
i'm
trying
to
be
precise
in
what
our
duty
is,
what
we
are
charged
with.
under
the
jones
act
where
a
plaintiff
is
required
to
prove
negligence,
well
how
does
he
prove?
he
got
to
establish
some
standard
of
care
and
if
he
doesn't
establish
a
standard
of
care
by
merely
saying
that
there
wasn't
something
there,
he
has
to
have
some
evidence,
the
matter
of
this
guy
particularly,
this
unique
structure
that
there
should
have
been
something
more
there
than
there
was
there.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
he
had
just
--
mr.
walter
x.
connor
yes
sir.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
yes
sir,
that
is
–
that
is
a
matter
which
might
go
to
the
jury.
yes.
in
other
words,
if
the
claim
was,
and
it
was,
that
the
platform
by
reason
of
wear
it
was
slippery
and
it
should
have
had
some
type
of
paint
on
which
might
tend
to
inhibit
slipping,
that
would
be
a
jury
question.
however,
that's
not
what
we
have
here
and
the
--
mr.
walter
x.
connor
no
sir,
not
in
this
court,
it
is
not.
the
only
thing
that's
here
is
the
matter
of
handrails
and
safety
devices,
that's
all.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
it
might.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
i
wouldn't
say
so
your
honor.
no.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
matter
of
--
it's
not
a
matter
of
architecture
which
is
all
we're
talking
about
here.
have
in
mind,
if
your
honor
please,
that
this
case
was
set
back
for
a
new
trial
that
the
judges
below
in
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
were
numerous
other
areas
which
were
charged
by
the
defendant
which
they
did
not
think
necessary
to
notice
because
they
were
setting
the
case
back
for
a
new
trial.
and
judge
waterman,
in
his
en
banc
decision
said
that
after
reviewing
the
record,
he's
ordered
it
to
go
back
for
a
new
trial.
i'm
not
going
to
discuss
those
areas
here
now.
i
don't
have
the
time
in
the
first
place
and
the
second
place
as
i
conceive
it
and
the
only
–
the
only
charge
of
error
that's
made
in
this
court
and
i
think
that
we
have
a
right
to
rely
on
that
because
i
haven't
done
anything
with
these
–
these
other
charges,
is
that
there
should
have
been
handrails
in
this
area.
yes
all
there
is
in
this
case
and
this
court.
now
it
could
very
well
be
that
a
jury
could
say
you
ought
to
have
some
kind
of
a
particular
substance
on
a
metal
deck,
lots
of
decks
of
ships
have
metals,
and
there
is
this
access
all
you
speak
off,
but
the
ship
is
full
of
such
access
holes,
not
only
in
the
quarters
where
the
seamen
are
and
where
they
have
to
do
their
work
but
in
the
passengers
accommodations.
there
are
hundreds
of
such
places.
you
come
up
a
stairway
and
there's
no
--
a
door
doesn't
suddenly
shut
behind
you
so
if
you
happen
to
lose
your
balance,
you
fall
back
in
the
stairway.
there's
any
number
of
such
stairways
throughout
the
ship
and
it's
not
sought
to
be
negligent
because
if
you
don't
have
the
–
the
opening
suddenly
shut
up
so
that
if
you
lose
your
balance,
you
won't
fall
back.
now
i
think
that
--
of
course
i
have
to
deal
with
this
maintenance
now
and
i'm
not
satisfied
and
i've
completed
my
argument
on
this
but
as
i
say,
i've
got
my
time
problems
and
i'm
going
to
go
over
now
to
the
maintenance
aspect
of
this
case
and
rely
upon
the
matter
stated
as
my
brief.
now
with
respect
to
maintenance,
as
i
said
before,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
repeat
the
details,
there
was
a
very
substantial
disagreement
among
the
plaintiff's
doctors
and
the
defendant's
doctors.
my
doctor
said
that
the
plaintiff
was
able
to
go
back
to
work
and
i
have
moving
picture
showing
him
doing
all
kinds
of
things
which
he
said
he
couldn't
do
in
court.
he
crawled
around
in
the
courtroom
and
i
have
to
walk
him
down
the
street
like
he
was
trying
to
do
a
mile,
i
had
him
jacking
up
an
automobile
and
so
on.
so
we
had
that
dispute
but
that's
one
of
the
things
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
determined
which
doctor
am
i
going
to
believe,
the
plaintiff
during
the
time
between
his
actions
and
the
trial
had
certified
to
the
new
jersey
motor
vehicle
bureau
that
he
was
well
and
strong
and
not
suffering
from
any
condition.
now,
under
the
rules
--
mr.
walter
x.
connor
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
no
sir.
the
only
stipulation
we
made
with
respect
to
maintenance
if
it
please
the
court,
is
that
the
trial
judge
could
determine
the
maintenance
count.
and
we
did
agree
that
when
the
court
said
i'm
going
to
allow
this
maintenance
to
date,
we
figured
out
what
that
was.
we
have
paid
them
a
lot
of
money
in
maintenance.
now
if
you
make
--
no,
as
a
matter
fact,
i
can
test
it
that
very
quickly.
he
gave
him
three
years
without
any
finding
that
he
was
entitled
to
three
years.
now
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
when
we're
talking
about
maintenance,
when
a
seaman
is
disabled
and
unable
to
work
or
under
treatment,
it
doesn't
mean
he
gets
maintenance.
first
of,
if
he's
in
a
hospital,
he
gets
his
maintenance
there.
so
there
would
–
should
have
a
determination
here
by
the
trial
judge
if
he
was
going
to
allow
three
years
maintenance
and
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
it
incidentally
that
he
would
have
to
take
his
treatment
outside
of
the
hospital.
if
he
took
any
of
it
inside
of
the
hospital
then
he
wasn't
entitled
to
any
maintenance
with
for
the
period
of
time
which
he
was
in
the
hospital.
now
under
the
rules
of
--
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
when
a
trial
judge
determines
an
issue
before
him,
he
must
make
findings
of
facts
and
conclusions
of
law.
the
trial
judge
did
not
do
that
here.
he
merely
made
a
short
statement
that
i
think
the
poor
man
needs
more
treatment
and
i'm
going
to
give
it
to
him.
there
were
some
things
said
about
him
in
getting
rehabilitation
treatment.
well
the
only
evidence
of
that
is
that
the
one
time
he
was
to
go
to
the
hospital
for
rehabilitation
treatment,
he
didn't
show
up.
now,
this
court
has
very
wisely
said
in
the
taylor-calmar
case
and
reiterated
in
the
farrell
case
and
it
doesn't
--
it
isn't
a
smart
thing
to
give
a
seaman
a
lot
of
money
in
advance
for
their
future
medical
treatment
because
they
are
said
to
be
spend
trips
and
you'd
give
him
a
huge
sum
of
money
like
here
$10,000
or
so
it
is,
he
go
out
and
spend
it
and
when
he
needed
a
treatment,
it
wouldn't
be
there
for.
so
the
--
this
court
had
decided
and
i
think
in
a
well
reasoned
statement
that
what
should
be
done
is
to
give
the
man
enough
for
the
immediate
future
providing
of
course
as
evidence
of
it.
and
then
at
the
end
of
that
period
of
time,
if
he
needs
more,
he
can
come
back
and
get
more.
and
in
this
instance
to
say
three
years
in
advance
and
he's
going
to
need
treatment
without
any
evidence
to
support
it,
the
plaintiff
had
to
qualify
doctors
neither
of
whom
said
he
needed
treatment.
if
your
honors
will
notice
the
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
have
pointed
out
what
the
evidence
was
with
respect
to
this,
that
there
was
plenty
of
a
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
he
needed
the
treatment
on
the
plaintiff's
own
testimony.
one
of
the
plaintiff's
doctors
indicated
that
perhaps
he
would
become
permanently
disabled
where
no
cure
could
be
of
any
help
to
him
if
he
ever
gets
to
that
stage.
that's
another
time
when
maintenance
ceases.
actually,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
made
a
determination
as
how
far
in
the
future,
maintenance
should
go.
back
in
the
--
in
the
early
case,
the
first
case
where
there
was
a
determination
of
it,
in
the
calmar-taylor
case,
it
was
then
–
it
had
to
be
decided
whether
or
not
maintenance
right
–
the
seaman's
right
to
maintenance
extended
beyond
the
end
of
the
voyage.
that's
what
the
state
of
the
law
was
then
and
the
second
circuit
made
a
decision
not
at
all
to
go
beyond
that
in
connection
with
harbor
worker
and
when
the
case
came
down
here,
this
court
made
an
examination
of
what
the
law
was
after
that
time
and
determined
that
seamen
should
get
maintenance
beyond
the
end
of
the
voyage
and
that
it
should
extend
through
reasonable
time
but
not
beyond
that
time
and
further
more
that
no
large
amounts
like
seven
years
which
was
allowed
in
that
case
should
be
permitted.
now
that's
the
only
case
i
know
of
which
has
ever
come
to
this
court
where
anytime
has
ever
been
fixed
for
the
length
of
maintenance.
and
it's
a
burden
which
is
imposed
upon
the
shipowner
along
with
all
the
other
burdens
that
has
to
face
now
and
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
be
likely
treated.
today,
a
seaman
has
a
right
to
indemnity
even
though
he
doesn't
prove
any
negligence
under
the
unseaworthiness
theory.
the
doctrine
of
negligence
is
to
the
point
now
where
there
is
some
negligence
then
he's
entitled
to
recover
damages
even
though
it's
not
the
specific
cause
of
its
injury
as
long
as
somebody
could
say
it
was.
so
i
say
we're
at
the
point
now
where
i
think
maintenance
ought
to
be
very
carefully
considered
and
that
these
outright
grants
of
three
years
of
maintenance
ought
not
to
be
permitted.
i
wanted
to
say
one
other
thing
and
i'm
going
to
suspend.
something
was
said
here
about
the
court
that
are
being
other
evidence
of
negligence
which
a
jury
could
have
attached
its
finding.
well
that's
very
true,
but
their
law
is
true
that
where
there
are
a
number
of
charges
of
negligence,
one
of
two
of
which
may
not
support
a
verdict
and
the
whole
thing
has
to
go
back
and
be
tried
again
and
that's
what
happened
here
and
there's
adequate
law
to
sustain
that
feature
of
the
case.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
i
have
to
say
this
to
you,
your
honor,
that
these
photographs
which
i
have
with
my
copies,
mr.
klonsky,
i've
given
a
copy
during
the
--
before
the
trial
and
he
introduced
his
evidence
that
he
will
say
that
the
pictures
i
have
and
i
didn't
say
that
there
was
these
copies
of
what
i
have
previously
given
on
what
was
on
the
trial.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
i
have
here
the
addition
to
that
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
and
i
submit
the
drawing
of
this
radar
tower.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
which
i'd
be
very
glad
to
leave
with
the
court
if
somebody
helps.
could
i
have
just
one
second
for
an
answer
to
one
of
your
questions,
your
honor?
you
asked
what
mr.
salem
is
doing
now.
he
is
still
outpatient
since
the
trial,
still
undergoing
rehabilitation.
he
made
two
attempts
to
go
back
to
work
and
it's
a
part
of
judge
ritter's
opinion
when
he
gave
three
years
future
maintenance.
that
was
unsuccessful.
he
spent
years
in
hospital,
years
out
of
the
hospital
and
he's
still
under
treatment.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
yes,
your
honor.
but
as
of
right
now,
he
is
still
not
fit
for
duty
at
the
marine
hospital.
mr.
walter
x.
connor
thank
you,
your
honor.
