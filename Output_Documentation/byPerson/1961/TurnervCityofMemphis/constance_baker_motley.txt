ms.
constance
baker
motley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
appellant
appealed
to
this
court
pursuant
to
title
28,
section
1253
from
an
order
entered
by
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
tennessee,
western
division
on
february
10th,
1961.
the
order
which
was
entered
after
a
trial
on
the
merits
state
all
further
proceedings
in
this
cause
pending
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
by
the
appellant
for
construction
of
the
state
statute
under
consideration.
in
this
case,
appellant
challenges
the
refusal
of
the
appellee,
city
of
memphis
and
its
lessee,
dobbs
houses
to
serve
negroes
in
the
main
dining
room
of
the
dobbs
houses'
restaurant
which
is
located
in
the
memphis
municipal
airport.
the
appellant's
claim
is
that
such
refusal
in
the
light
of
the
conceded
facts
in
this
case
and
set
of
law
violates
rights
secured
to
him
and
members
of
his
class
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
issuance
of
an
immediate
permanent
injunction.
however,
in
view
of
this
court's
decision
on
yesterday
in
the
case
of
bailey
against
patterson,
holding
that
three
judges
are
not
required,
when
as
here,
prior
decisions
by
this
court
make
frivolous
any
claim
that
a
state
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
appellant
request
this
court
to
dispose
of
this
case
in
the
same
manner
in
which
it
disposed
of
the
bailey
case
or
in
the
alternative
to
consider
the
papers
on
this
appeal
as
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
before
judgment
where
there
is
presently
pending
an
appeal
from
the
same
order
sought
to
be
reviewed
by
this
court.
and
in
support
of
this
request,
appellant
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
now,
we
have
not
filed
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
please
let's
go
down
the
line.
the
only
thing
which
is
here
is
the
appeal
from
the
order
entered
below.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir,
the
exact
same
order
and
the
same
record
is
now
before
the
court
of
appeals
because
we
had
some
doubt
that
this
was
properly
a
three-judge
court
case.
it's
to
protect
ourselves.
we
perfected
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right
sir.
however,
we
would
like
the
court,
as
i
indicated
to
treat
this
case
as
it
did
the
bailey
case
that
is,
to
determine
the
authority
of
the
district
court
which
we
say
in
this
case,
the
only
authority
the
district
court
had
in
view
of
the
fact
--
that
the
view
of
the
fact
that
the
facts
were
considered
and
the
law
was
settled
was
to
enter
permanent
injunction.
and
there
really
would
be
no
purpose
served
in
sending
this
case
or
sending
us
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
there
is
nothing
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
do,
we
say,
except
to
direct
the
entry
of
a
permanent
injunction.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
sir.
we
asked
the
court
of
appeals
to
stay
all
proceedings
pending
the
disposition
of
this
appeal
and
they
granted
that
motion.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir.
three-judge
court
was
complete.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
ci
--
the
circuit
judge
martin
and
judge
miller
from
nashville.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
i
think
it
is.
william
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
you
know,
the
regulation
here
on
its
face,
either
required
or
permitted
segregation
and
we
say
that
there
is
no
construction
which
the
state
court
could
give
to
that
regulation.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
we
would
still
have
the
constitutional
question
here
that
is
the
reference
of
the
state
court
would
not
dispose
of
a
constitutional
question
whether
this
lessee
is
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
so
that
we
say
there
was
no
need
to
refer
to
the
state
court
for
that
construction.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
--
yes,
the
constitutional
issue
would
be
not
be
mooted
or
eliminated
from
the
case
if
the
state
court
should
hold
that
the
regulatory
agency
was
without
power
to
issue
such
regulation
because,
you
see,
dobbs
houses
says,
quite
apart
from
any
state
order
or
statute,
we
segregate
on
our
own
as
a
matter
of
business
practice.
so
the
question
here
is
whether
they
can
being
this
kind
of
lessee.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
think
in
this
case,
they
conceded
in
effect
that
this
was
burton
because
they
conceded
that
this
was
a
restaurant
in
a
municipally
owned
airport,
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
serve
the
public.
there
was
no
question
here
that
the
public
was
served
in
this
restaurant.
they
attach
to
their
answer
a
copy
--
the
city
attached
to
its
answer
a
copy
of
the
lease
and
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
this
decision
was
rendered
before
burton,
i
believe.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir,
but
i
think
that
this
court's
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
because
it
was
--
the
decision
was
rendered
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
burton,
but
we
say
that
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
sir
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
the
state
co
--
well,
i
think
yes.
there
was
a
discussion
of
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
all
they
did
here,
well
they
might
have,
but
all
they
did
here
was
to
refer
to
state
court
for
that.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
think
here,
the
--
it's
like
bailey
because
this
court
had
decided
the
muir
case
which
again
was
a
lease
of
a
public
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
muir
versus
louisville
park
theatrical
association
in
the
same
circuit.
this
si
--
was
a
sixth
circuit
case
and
that
case
involved
the
lease
of
amphitheater
in
a
public
park.
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
lessee
in
that
case
was
not
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
court
in
1954
immediately
following
brown
reversed
or
vacated
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
and
sent
it
back
for
consideration
in
the
light
of
brown,
and
the
provisions
which
then
prevailed.
so
that
it
was
settled,
i
think
that
any
lease
of
public
property
used
for
public
purpose,
there
is
no
question
if
you
were
using
this
facility
for
public
purpose,
has
been
settled.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
in
bailey,
yesterday,
there
was
also
an
airport
restaurant
involved
and
the
lessee
and
this
court
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
did
the
same
thing.
you
see,
the
jackson
municipal
airport
is
a
party
defendant
in
bailey.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
they
have,
likewise,
leased
their
restaurant
to
a
private
lessee.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
think
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
think
bailey
dealt
with
transportation
facilities
and
this
is
transportation
facility,
also.
and
i
think
the
court
intended
to
say
that
any
state
enforced
segregation
in
any
transportation
facility
is
settled
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
party;
the
lessee
as
well
as
the
airport
authority.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
railroad,
that's
right.
the
air
--
the
terminal
facilities
in
these
cases
were
involved
not
just
the
carrier
facility.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
so
that
we
think
it
is
governed
by
bailey
because
bailey
had
the
same
facility
involved.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
believe
there
is
only
the
hendrik
case
and
the
coke,
district
court
decision.
in
the
coke
case
in
atlanta,
the
same
restaurant
was
involved
dobbs
houses
and
the
district
court
there
ruled
that
that
lessee
arrangement
was
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
the
hendrick
case
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
that
involved
an
airport
facility
in
south
carolina
in
which
the
court
ruled
that
we
were
entitled
to
an
immediate
injunction
in
that
case.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
we
ask
this
court
to
do
one
of
two
things;
either
refer
this
case
back
to
the
district
court
pursuant
to
its
power
to
determine
the
authority
of
the
district
court
and
say
to
the
district
court,
“your
only
authority
here
was
to
issue
the
injunction
prayed
for
because
the
facts
were
conceded.
this
was
a
public
restaurant
in
a
public
airport”
and
the
law
was
settled
that
where
or
is
now
settled
by
burton
that
where
you
have
a
public
facility
which
has
been
leased
for
public
purpose
or
public
use
concededly
then
that
lessee
is
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
think
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
bailey
yesterday,
although
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal,
it
does
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
authority
of
the
district
court.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
he
might
that
but
he
would
still
have
to
say,
in
addition,
i
think,
that
this
lessee
is
--
is
a
burton
case
that
wouldn't
be
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
true.
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
or
--
well,
yes,
if
the
court
didn't
do
that
pursuant
to
what
it
did
in
bailey
than
to
treat
the
papers
to
search
for
or
before
judgment
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
we
say
first,
that
this
court
under
--
as
they
did
in
bailey
should
determine
the
authority
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
i
sho
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that
--
that
--
that
is
true,
but
we
say
there's
nothing
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
in
this
case
and
that
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
let
me
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
but
we
say
that's
--
we
think
that
this
court
can
under
bailey,
direct
the
entry
of
a
judgment
which
is
all
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
doing
and
that
we
should
be
saved
the
necessity
of
going
through
an
appeal
through
the
sixth
circuit
because
there's
nothing
for
them
do.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir,
we
are.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
we
have
the
come
up
in
a
normal
cause.
we've
only
docketed
the
record
there
and
we
haven't
filed
any
briefs
and
they
haven't
sent
any
arguments.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
we
(voice
overlap).
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
yes,
we
appealed
on
the
ground
that
we
felt
that
there
was
some
doubt
but
then
we
thought
that
this
was
properly
an
appeal
from
a
one
judge
court.
but
since
there
was
some
question
and
we
had
taken
this
appeal,
we
ask
them
to
hold
it
and
see
what
this
court
would
do
with
it.
we
say
--
we
just
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
we
haven't
filed
any
brief
for
anything
but
the
reason
for
appealing
was
that
we
felt
that
this
court
might
rule
that
it
was
properly
a
single
judge
case.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
we
did
appeal
here
and
i
say
that
this
court
settled
that
matter
yesterday
with
the
bailey
case.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
our
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
when
we
filed
a
complaint,
we've
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
our
--
our
complaint
--
that
complaint
preceded
on
the
12
--
1343
(3)
an
alleged
that
acting
on
the
power
of
state
laws,
city
ordinances,
the
defendants
were
segregating
negroes
in
the
airport.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
we
did
not
set
out
in
the
complaint
that
there
was
statute
so
and
so
and
so.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
defendants
in
their
answer
said,
“we
rely
on
this
order
as
giving
us
the
authority
to
segregate
them.”
they
were
later
permitted
to
rely
on
another
statute
which
they
claim
authorized
the
segregation.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
it's
tennessee.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
sir.
i
do
not
know
what
i'm
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
object
to
this
--
this
proposal.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i'd
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
i
think
i
only
have
about
five
minutes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
summarize
the
appellant's
position
and
that
is
that
we
feel
that
this
case
is
governed
by
bailey
in
that
here
also
is
involved
a
transportation
facility
and
that
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
bailey,
its
prior
decisions
which
were
in
existence
when
this
answer
was
filed
made
clear
that
any
state
enforced
segregation
in
a
transportation
facility
was
unconstitutional.
so
that
we
think
that
the
law
was
settled
at
the
time
this
answer
was
filed
in
this
case
as
result
of
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
so
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
dispose
of
this
case
in
the
same
manner
in
which
it
disposed
of
the
bailey
case
by
sending
it
to
the
district
court
and
saying
your
own
--
your
only
authority
in
this
case,
in
light
of
our
prior
decisions
and
certainly
now,
in
the
light
of
bailey
and
burton
is
to
grant
the
criminal
injunction
requested
because
the
facts
are
conceded.
and
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
all
of
the
facts
which
we
think
make
this
case
almost
identical
with
burton.
these
are
the
facts
which
the
court
sees
from
the
lease
in
this
case
which
the
city
attached
to
its
answer.
and
when
the
city
attached
that
to
its
answer
we
moved
for
summary
judgment
that
there
was
no
dispute
that
this
was
a
public
restaurant.
now,
the
plaintiff
got
a
three-judge
court
in
this
case
over
his
objection.
the
record
makes
it
clear
that
we
argued
that
this
was
not
a
three-judge
court
case
and
the
argument
and
summaries
that's
in
the
record
and
we
pointed
out
that
we
--
we
thought
the
law
was
settled
that
no
three-judge
court
was
required
here
so
that
they
--
when
we
got
these
three-judge
court,
we
got
to
delay
in
the
enforcement
of
the
constitutional
right
involved
here
which
was
not
the
full
to
the
plaintiff.
and
we
think
that
they
require
us
to
now
pursue
the
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
question
here
is
well
settled
and
will
only
penalize
this
plaintiff
or
appellant
further
with
more
delay
which
was
not
caused
by
the
plaintiff
in
his
original
pleading.
we
argued
against
it.
we
did
not
ask
for
a
three-judge
court.
we
got
it
as
a
consequence.
we
got
this
long
delay
in
the
enforcement
of
a
simple
constitutional
right
which
i
think
was
clear
from
the
day
we
filed
this
complaint
that
this
appellant
was
entitled
to.
