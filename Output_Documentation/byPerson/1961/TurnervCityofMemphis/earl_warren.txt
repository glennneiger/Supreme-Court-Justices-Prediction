chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
motley,
do
you
--
do
you
know
whether
counsel
objects
to
hear
the
pro
--
procedure
you
now
propose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
do
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
can
i
ask
the
counsel
without
asking
for
your
argument,
now,
if
counsel
does
object
to
--
to
sending
it
back
under
bailey
to
the
district
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
we
won't
ask
you
to
make
your
argument
now.
we
--
i
just
thought
that
if
there
was
no
disagreement
that
we
probably
were
using
up
valuable
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
that's
alright.
excuse
me,
ms.
motley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
do
that.
mr.
gianotti.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
only
--
don't
usually
do
it
to
summary
case
but
we
will
do
it
in
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
has
--
you
may
divide
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
name
sir?
i
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heiskell,
you
may
--
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
i
notice
that
in
the
fourth
defense
in
the
city's
answer
and
the
third
defense
of
the
--
no,
fourth
defense
of
--
of
your
answer
on
behalf
of
the
restaurants
is
that
regardless
of
what
the
courts
of
tennessee
do
in
declaring
that
--
that
law
unconstitutional,
you
will
still
maintain
your
restaurant
in
this
manner
because
you
have
a
private
right
to
--
right
to
do
it
and
you
will
not
be
governed
by
that
by
any
subsequence
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
city
still
maintains
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
do
in
their
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
us
ask
--
let
us
ask
if
that
is
the
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
ask
you
specifically
then,
please,
whether
you
stand
on
--
on
your
fourth
defense
or
whether
you
are
prepared
to
withdraw
it
at
this
time.
that
fourth
defense
reads
as
follows,
“this
defendant
averse
that
even
if
the
above
cited
regulation
of
the
state
of
tennessee
should
be
voided,
dobbs
houses
incorporated
operates
the
restaurant
at
the
memphis
municipal
airport
as
a
private
ci
--
facility
to
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
apply
and
the
operator
has
the
legal
right
to
enforce
any
rules
and
policies
which
it
deems
desirable
in
regard
to
the
seating
of
patrons
including
the
right
to
seek
and
serve
patrons
in
separate
areas
because
of
race
and
color.
this
defendant
as
above
stated
is
advised
that
dobbs
houses
incorporated
does
maintain
separate
eating
areas
for
the
negro
and
white
races
in
its
dining
room.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you've
raised
it
as
the
defense.
i
asked
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
asked
you
if
you
waive
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you
waive
that
defense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
you
don't
say
advice.
you
say
this
defendant
averse
that
even
if
the
ordinance
is
voided,
that
dobbs
operates
the
restaurant
at
the
memphis
airport
as
a
private
facility
to
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
apply
and
the
operator
has
the
legal
right
to
enforce
any
rules
and
policies
which
it
deems
desirable
to
regard
in
the
seating
of
patrons
and
so
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
answers
it
all.
