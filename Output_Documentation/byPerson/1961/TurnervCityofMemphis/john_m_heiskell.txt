representing
the
--
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
the
dobbs
house
restaurants
operate
the
airport
restaurant
in
memphis
under
a
lease
from
the
city
of
memphis.
one
of
the
provisions
of
that
lease
provides
that
it
shall
be
used
--
both
portion
of
it
shall
be
used
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
in
the
third
offense
set
up
by
the
city
of
memphis
in
answer
to
the
complaint
filed
in
this
cause,
they
state
the
regulation
issued
pursuant
to
statute
by
the
department
of
state
government
which
requires
the
segregation
of
restaurants
in
tennessee,
which
regulation
may
not
be
constitutional
but
which
has
not
then
passed
on
at
this
point
by
any
court
with
regard
to
its
constitutionality.
the
city
sets
up
that
regulation
as
existing
state
law
and
says
as
a
part
of
their
defense
that
if
dobbs
houses
desegregates
their
restaurants,
they
will
consider
it
a
violation
of
clause
20
of
the
lease
which
is
the
unlawful
use
clause
and
that
the
lease
will
be
subject
to
forfeiture.
now,
we
have
sought
on
behalf
of
dobbs
houses
and
we
thought
the
doctrine
announced
by
the
three-judge
court
was
appropriate
in
that
the
constitutionality
of
that
regulation
should
be
decided
by
a
state
court.
we
are
still
at
that
opinion,
but
we
have
been
brought
in
--
in
the
position
and
are
in
the
position
that
if
we
desegregate
the
restaurant
without
having
that
regulation
passed
upon,
the
city
has
announced
in
the
formal
pleadings
filed
below
that
it
will
seek
a
forfeiture
of
the
lease
which
dobbs
houses
holds.
now,
we
have
said
that
we
think
it
is
appropriate
for
the
state
courts
to
pass
on
it.
the
ju
--
declaratory
judgment
procedures
are
available
to
these
plaintiffs
that
we
--
we
don't
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
litigating
with
the
city
or
being
prosecuted
in
the
state
courts
if
that
procedure
is
followed
then
it
has
been
declared
that
they
consider
it
violative
of
the
law
of
the
state
of
tennessee
if
we
permit
the
restaurant
to
be
operated
in
that
manner.
and
we
say
that
we
are
very
definitely
of
the
opinion
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
state
courts.
the
state
courts
of
tennessee
have
shown
no
reluctance
to
follow
the
mandates
of
constitutional
law
laid
down
by
this
court
and
other
cases
and
we
think
that
is
the
simple
and
expeditious
way
to
dispose
it.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
i
cannot
argue
that
in
view
of
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
that
we
have
that
right.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
i
think
that
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
these
court,
the
delaware
case
--
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
--
is
--
deprives
me
of
being
able
to
make
any
argument
to
that
effect
or
to
sue
it
by
as
my
client.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
i
can't
--
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
yes,
sir
but
i
say
we
--
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
all
of
the
answers
were
filed
before
burton.
we
did
not
have
it
--
i
cannot
persist
in
any
defense
that
has
been
made
other
than
the
dilemma
of
having
what
is
presumed
to
be
a
constitutional
statute
on
the
books
of
tennessee
which
the
city
has
said,
if
we
violate,
they
will
consider
it
a
forfeiture
of
our
lease.
now,
so
far
as
the
personal
right
to
determine
that
in
an
airport
restaurant,
we
do
not
persist
in
that
position
and
i
could
not
so
advice
the
point.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
i
would
say
thi
--
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
i
would
say
this
now
that
we
would
still
be
subject
to
arrest
by
state
authority
for
violating
what
is
on
the
books
as
a
valid
state
statute
until
judicially
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
we
thought
that
that
would
be
the
way
that
these
matters
should
be
handled
expeditiously
that
--
rather
than
burden
this
court
with
each
of
the
--
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
i
--
very
--
please
--[laughter]
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
yes.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
i
--
i
cannot
say
to
the
contrary.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
i
--
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
we
have
no
right
to
rely
on
that
statute.
the
city
of
memphis
does
not
have
that
in
its
defense.
that
is
his
defense
without
having
the
--
on
this
statute
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
but
i
said,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
that
should
be
determined
by
a
state
court,
--
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
except
the
burton
case
and
the
bailey
where
decisions
of
a
state
court
and
as
i
remember
the
well,
as
your
honor's
remarks
in
the
burton
case,
ms
motley
that
i
would
always
thought
to
defend
would
--
was
make
it
slowly
and
i
think,
your
honor
used
his
words
generally
to
that
effect
in
the
burton
case.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
on
the
state
statute,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
if
the
court
please
the
defense
that
we
have
in
there
is
the
regulation
of
the
department
of
conservation.
we
have
not
pleaded
in
the
other
section
that
mr.
heiskell
has
pleaded
because
that's
a
permissive
type
of
statute
though.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
not
applicable
to
the
city
of
memphis.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
i
used
brown,
may
it
please
your
honor
--
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
--
was
left
for
deliberate
speed
argument
only
not
with
the
other.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
that
was
the
first
question
that
chief
justice
asked
me
--
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
that's
correct.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
if
i
--
i
understand
your
honor,
i
think
that
do
what
dobbs
house
does
under
that
defense,
is
dobbs
house
business,
we
exercise
no
control
on
them.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
i
say,
what
dobbs
house
does
under
a
similar
defense
that
they
have
raised
is
a
choice,
it's
a
permissive.
the
city
of
memphis
can
exercise
no
control
over.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
well,
on
--
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
--
is
advised.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
well,
it's
--
it's
not
strictly
speaking
that
defense
may
it
please
your
honor
because
he
says
this
defendant
as
above
stated
is
advised
that
they
are
doing
it
under
the
1875
act.
it's
not
anything
that
the
city
of
memphis
does.
mr.
john
m.
heiskell
i'm
like
--
is
an
officer
to
this
court,
if
i
can
limit
my
position
that
way,
i
am
bound
by
the
same
statement
that
mr.
heiskell
is
bound.
of
course,
that
defense
was
raised
prior
to
other
decisions
of
this
court.
does
that
answer
your
honor?
