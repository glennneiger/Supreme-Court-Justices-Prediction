justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
stated
those
facts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
the
types
of
appeals
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
upon
the
same
order
that's
what
i'm
what
trying
to
point
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now,
i
gather
your
position
is,
therefore
our
decision
yesterday
is
satisfied
that
an
appeal
here
has
not
lied
that
should
have
been
a
single
judge
determination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore
the
proper
appeals
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
the
trial
judge
did
here,
i
gather,
was
to
abstain
and
send
it
to
the
state
court,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
position
is
that
there's
no
more
reason
for
a
state
court
determination
of
this
statute
and
ordinances
than
there
was
in
the
bailey
case
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
the
restaurant
that
the
airport
attack
in
mississippi
say
involved
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
party,
party
at
--.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
too,
you'd
be
long
while
getting
reach
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it'd
be
quite
a
while
getting
reached,
wouldn't
you
in
the
sixth
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
guess
it
wasn't
clear
to
a
lot
of
people
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand,
it
was
not
judicial
notice.
it
was
an
affirmative
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
either
the
defendants?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
mr.
heiskell,
if
the
city
were
now
to
say,
we
agree
burton
and
bailey
or
both
means
that
we
can't
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
regulation
and
therefore,
our
defense
--
your
defense
now
would
fall,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
everybody
concedes
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
want
a
court
decision
to
say
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
prefer
the
state
court
rather
than
a
federal
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
have
it
here
now.
we
have
the
burden.
