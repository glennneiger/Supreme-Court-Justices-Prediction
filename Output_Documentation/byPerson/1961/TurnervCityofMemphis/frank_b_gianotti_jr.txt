mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
as
your
honor
well
knows
the
city
attorney
had
available
authority
to
--
to
be
merely
seeing
anybody
and
after
that
it
was
not
tried
in
every
way
possible
could
be
helpful
but
i
just
don't
know
if
counsel
will
fully
explain
and
hand
down
just
exactly
what
their
position
is,
it
may
leave
with
their
answers
in
some
doubt
away
which
you
read
last
night
the
bailey
case.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
if
i
could
this
at
--
some
change
in
some
issue
in
this.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
may
it
please,
your
honor
and
members
of
the
court.
a
attention
has
been
called
to
the
rule
of
court.
perhaps,
we
should've
made
a
previous
application
since
mr.
heiskell,
who
represents
dobbs
houses,
and
i
who
represents
the
city
of
memphis,
while
in
some
respect,
we're
on
the
same
side,
he
still
has
his
position
and
the
city
of
memphis
has
its
position.
if
--
if
i
may
make
application
this
time
on
behalf
of
myself
and
also
mr.
heiskell,
we
can
arrange
a
division
of
time
anyway
that
will
suit,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
well,
we
will,
of
course,
concern
as
to
the
position
that
counsel
would
take.
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
--
i
fully
understand
it.
on
the
first
reading
or
second
reading
or
three
readings
of
the
bailey
case,
it
might
appear
that
--
that
part
of
the
ground
had
been
lifted
out
from
under
our
position.
on
the
other
hand,
we
would
like
briefly
to
make
this
statement,
in
an
attempt
to
point
out
the
difference
as
we
see,
as
indicated
already
by
justice
frankfurter
in
the
burton
case,
which
as
has
been
stated,
was
not
on
the
books
at
the
time
judges
martin,
boyd
and
miller
filed
the
decision
in
this
case
which
closely
followed
harrison
versus
naacp.
in
other
words,
the
district
court,
three-judge
court
felt
that
on
the
basis
of
the
expressions
contained
in
the
harrison
case,
the
fact
that
the
--
all
sides
of
the
case
were
apparently
fully
discussed
among
the
members
of
this
court,
that
the
premise
seem
to
be
present
to
the
three-judge
court,
that
harrison
should
be
followed.
we're
having
at
some
concern
frankly
in
--
in
trying
to
analyze
the
case
decided
on
yesterday
where
no
mention
is
made
of
harrison.
and
the
language
used
not
only
in
the
majority
opinion
but
also
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
harrison
case,
it
seemed
to
leave
no
doubt
but
that
where
you
had
statutes
that
had
not
been
authoritatively
decided
by
a
state
court
and
to
meet
the
test
usually
applied
in
abstention
cases,
some
three
or
four
are
member.
there
hasn't
a
friction
for
instance.
there's
one,
as
i
remember,
and
some
others
at
the
--
the
matter
should
be
decided
by
a
state
court.
if
i
may
digress
for
just
a
moment
--
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
sir?
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
i
necessarily,
your
honor,
it's
already
been
indicated
here.
may
it
please
your
honor
that
for
example,
it
might
well
be
contended
that
the
regulation,
you
see
there
two
statutes
involved.
originally,
it
was
a
city
ordinance
which
is
out
of
the
record.
well,
i
will
be
gladly
explaining
it
if
the
court
--
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
from
each
what?
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
yes,
it
takes
on
both
interstate
and
intrastate.
in
other
words,
the
rest
of
it
and
mr.
heiskell,
of
course,
will
speak
for
himself
on
that
but,
briefly,
patrons
use
it
who
are
not
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
it
is
an
attractive
place
for
people
who
go
and
dine
and
watch
airplanes
take
off
and
land.
so
--
this
complaint
made
no
point
that
the
plaintiff
turner
was
an
interstate
commerce.
there
is
no
statement
in
the
record
other
than
in
the
affidavit
in
connection
with
an
application
for
summary
judgment.
the
original
complaint
as
filed
made
no
mention
of
the
interstate
commerce
whatsoever.
now,
the
point
i
was
trying
to
get
to
in
order
to
develop
our
thinking
on
this
one
point
and
has
been
briefly
have
mentioned
i
think
by
justice
frankfurter
or
one
of
the
other
justices
when
they
talk
about
the
--
the
basis
for
the
regulation.
now,
it
could
very
well
be
that
this
regulation
as
adopted
by
the
department
of
conservation
in
the
state
of
tennessee
has
nothing
to
do
with
sanitation.
in
other
words,
it's
distinctly
unconnected
with
it
or
completely
unconnected
with
it
in
every
way
so
that
it
is
quite
possible
as
did
happen
in
the
streetcar
case
which
this
court
had
in
new
orleans,
evers
versus
dwyer.
the
facts
briefly
veiled
that
when
this
court
sent
in
it
back
because
of
this
standing,
and
by
the
way
evers
versus
dwyer,
as
your
honors
well
know
is
referred
to
in
the
bailey
case.
it's
one
of
the
points,
but
when
it
went
back,
the
transit
company
which
was
then
owned
by
a
private
operation,
decided
voluntarily
to
desegregate.
i
--
i'm
trying
to
point
out,
may
it
please,
your
honor,
just
how
quickly
sometimes
these
things
will
resolve
and
you
don't
have
quite
problem
that
you
think
you
do
but
you
have
to
do
it
under
a
judicial
manner.
as
elected
or
as
appointed
officials,
it
is
in
my
very
humble
opinion,
almost
impossible
to
take
a
position.
you
neither
agree
--
you
neither
satisfy
my
friends
on
the
left
nor
do
you
satisfy
your
friends
on
the
right.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
city
has
not
passed
the
regulation.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
and
if
the
state
law,
sir
that
--
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
yes,
the
state
--
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
department
of
conservation
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
yes.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
i
understand.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
on
that
particular
sta
--
statute,
the
answer
is
yes.
the
other
statute
involved
is
a
permissive
type
statute
which
gives
to
dobbs
house
its
right
to
serve
whomsoever
it
may
choose
to
serve.
now,
we
would
like
to
keep
in
mind
the
fact
that
the
cases
cited
in
counsel's
brief
and
the
cases
alluded
to
by
this
court,
the
boynton
case
and
the
burton
case
have
both
been
state
cases.
they're
going
up
through
the
state
processes
and
that
was
a
way
i
was
trying
--
a
point
i
was
trying
to
make
just
a
moment
ago.
when
the
criminal
courts
of
shelby
county
refused
to
issue
warrants
against
local
transit
officials
for
violating
the
segregation
bus
laws,
still
on
the
books
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
segregation
on
buses
automatically
ended
in
that
particular
case
much
quicker,
much
faster
than
the
method
suggested
by
ms.
motley
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
we
found
ourselves
in
an
entirely
different
position
that
is
the
city
of
memphis,
we
were
abiding
by
the
--
the
three-judge
court
of
martin
--
judges
martin,
miller
and
boyd
in
evers
versus
dwyer
which
also
was
an
abstention
ruling
and
an
order
to
that
effect
in
that
case.
it
is
out
of
the
picture.
it
has
since
--
the
case
has
since
been
disposed
off
by
a
motion
to
dismiss
it,
but
my
point
is
that
the
action
which
terminated
bus
segregation
in
memphis
came
about
as
the
result
of
the
action
of
a
state
court
rather
than
a
federal
court.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
well,
the
faith
--
no,
well,
in
action,
yes,
on
the
part
from
a
recommending
standpoint
on
the
office
of
the
city
attorney.
in
other
words,
if
i
may
briefly
say,
it
--
it
felt
--
we
felt
that
it
was
more
than
we
should
assume
to
say
to
the
chief
of
police
or
to
his
honor
or
anyone,
“yes,
you
have
a
right
to
issue
a
warrant
charging
x
with
viola
--
violating
the
segregation
laws
of
the
state
of
tennessee.”
we
would
not
make
such
a
statement.
when
we
refused
to
make
it,
those
who
have
different
ideas
from
the
ideas
expressed
and
contended
for
by
ms.
motley
and
her
clients,
they
went
into
and
attempted
to
get
warrant
issued
but
our
local
courts
refused
to
issue
the
warrant.
it's
been
the
policy
of
tennessee
in
numerous
cases.
judge
neill
in
the
old
united
artist
case
and
the
famous
curley
case,
which
came
to
this
court
by
a
certiorari,
certiorari
was
denied
but
judge
neill
in
that
case
specifically
point
out
that
color
was
not
a
factor
and
would
not
be
considered
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
in
a
very
recent
case
where
(inaudible)
which
was
cited
to
the
briefs
and
a
covenant
involving
the
sale
to
colored
people,
the
same
position
was
taken
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
so
i
think
we
should
have
no
fear
if
the
courts
of
tennessee
will
decide
these
statutes,
both
of
them,
the
permissive
type
statute
somewhat
similar
to
the
burton
statute
in
delaware
and
the
other
statute.
if
that
statute
on
its
face
is
--
is
bad,
then,
they
should
have
no
hesitancy
in
doing
what
the
three-judge
court
directed
that
they
do,
simply
file
the
suit
in
the
state
court.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
in
a
way,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
well,
the
point
that
we're
trying
to
make
is,
may
it
please
your
honor,
if
given
--
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
if
given
an
opportunity
--
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
if
given
an
opportunity,
we
say
that
the
public
officials
of
the
city
of
memphis
have
acted
in
good
faith
and
within
the
terms
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
brown
case.
now,
we
feel
that
--
that
is
officials
feel
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
consideration
based
on
the
leverage
field.
when
the
record
shows,
in
the
city
of
memphis,
that
there
has
been
desegregation
on
buses,
that
there
has
been
desegregation
on
the
school
placement
law
in
the
board
of
education,
there
has
been
desegregation
in
the
libraries,
there
has
been
a
plan
submitted
in
the
park
commission.
we've
had
some
six
to
seven
of
these
cases,
the
city
officials
have
moved
along
with
this
policy
in
mind
that
we
will
work
within
the
law
as
determined
by
the
courts.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
and
we
will
then
uphold
the
law
as
declared
by
the
courts.
yes,
sir?
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
on
the
face
of
it
--
on
the
face
of
it,
yes,
if
they
served
these
people,
they
are
disobedient
to
the
state
law.
mr.
heiskell,
i
don't
think
i
want
to
take
all
of
his
time
and
he
will
speak
for
that,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
it's
against
both
the
city
of
memphis
and
dobbs
house.
may
i
take
the
position
justice
frankfurter
that
they
are
sending
to
a
rare
--
mr.
frank
b.
gianotti,
jr.
--
if
they
op
--
if
they
operate
in
a
manner
not
authorized
by
the
state
law.
we
say
that
if
we
permit
them
to
operate
then,
we
are
being
subjected,
that
is
the
official
to
the
city
of
memphis
are
being
subjected
to
criticisms.
not
more
than
a
week
ago,
if
i
make
--
make
this
brief
(inaudible),
they
were
over
a
hundred
people
at
the
mayor's
office
asking
the
mayor
and
the
city
attorney
why
the
licenses
of
some
six
or
seven
large
department
stores
in
the
mem
--
in
the
city
of
memphis
who
have
--
which
had
opened
their
restaurants
on
a
non-segregated
basis
why
their
licenses
to
serve
food
were
not
revoked.
the
only
answer
we
could
give,
may
it
please
the
court
was
that
this
matter
set
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
next
monday
and
that
court
will
note
them
from
under
decision.
but
we
were
not
in
the
position
to
say
to
his
honor
or
to
the
city
commissioners,
“yes,
you
have
a
right
to
revoke
those
licenses,”
i
said
that
if
the
city
attorney's
office
said
that,
it
would
not
be
the
right
thing
to
do
in
--
in
my
opinion
and
we
have
not
said
it.
