justice
felix
frankfurter
mrs.
motley,
is
this
case,
in
your
view,
ruled
by
burton
against
the
wilmington
parking
association?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
had
assumed
and
in
that
regard,
the
difference
from
the
bailey
case
because
in
bailey
case
we
were
dealing
with
the
conceded
public
utilities.
in
the
burton
case,
the
court
had
to
go
through
an
examination
of
the
relationship
between
the
restaurant
and
(inaudible)
and
the
question
of
statutory
authorization
or
direction
was
--
did
not
trouble
the
majority,
it
was
not
involved
in
the
majority
but
court
ruled
in
that
case.
now,
in
this
case,
are
there
any
questions,
could
any
questions
arise
similar
to
those
which
had
to
be
canvassed
in
burton
before
the
decision
was
reached?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
court
of
--
the
district
court,
the
three-judge
court,
am
i
right,
doesn't
--
was
this
decided,
was
this
ruling
made
with
the
decision
of
the
district
court
before
or
after
the
burton
decision
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
there's
no
reference
--
there's
no
reference,
i'm
right,
am
i
not,
i
usually
look
through
that,
there's
no
reference
to
the
burton
decision
in
the
--
in
the
lower
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
then
--
i
said
it
--
there
was
no
reference
to
the
district
court
to
the
--
related
to
the
delaware
decision
is
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
state
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
all
we
know
--
for
all
we
know,
the
district
court
in
this
case
might
have
acted
otherwise
than
it
did,
if
it
had
the
burton-albertson
decision
before
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
and
therefore,
they
might
have
done
one
of
these
three
things.
they
might
have
done
what
they
did.
they
might
have
dobbs
--
burton
was
governing
or
they
might
have
thought
burton
was
not
governing,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
whether
this
is
like
bailey
in
that
--
the
starting
point
of
bailey
was
a
series
of
decisions
which
didn't
leave
the
question
open
that
deemed
to
be
open
by
the
district
court
in
mississippi.
now,
what
you
are
saying
is
the
same
situation
is
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
justice
harlan
pointed
out,
there
are
differences
and
i'm
pointing
out
some
more
differences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
say
the
court
--
when
you
say
the
court
sent
it
back
to
reconsider
in
the
light
of
brown,
you're
implying,
are
you
not,
that
this
court
didn't
say
this
is
so,
didn't
do
in
that
case
but
we
did
in
bailey
yesterday?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
that
was
said
in
bailey
unless
i'm
mistaken,
the
government
transportation.
i'm
not
saying
you're
not
right.
all
i'm
saying
that
--
that
one
does
have
to
establish
that
the
thing
is
had
been
so
established
that
--
that
--
is
a
fiction
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
fiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
railroad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it
that
you
--
you
ask
of
this
court,
mrs.
motley?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
hear
and
therefore
could
not
--
couldn't
understand
what
are
answer
was
to
justice
harlan's
question
that
if
the
district
court
now,
in
light
of
bailey
and
all
that
preceded,
might
pose
that
in
fact
memphis
didn't
have
power,
that
the
regulation
is
ultra
vires
to
specific
powers
and
go
on
that
ground
which
is
a
very
different
thing
from
striking
down
as
invalid
an
exercise
of
power.
so,
the
district
court
might
do
that,
would
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
--
i
(voice
overlap)
--
all
i
am
saying
it
doesn't
make
a
difference.
the
ground
on
which
the
court
goes
may
make
a
difference
though
the
result
maybe
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
--
there's
certain
that
another
thing
might
be
done
if
parties
on
both
sides,
if
there
is
a
consensual
withdrawal
of
this
appeal
then
your
--
your
appeal
because
the
court
of
appeals
would
go
forward,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
trying
to
manifest
litigation.
i'm
just
suggesting
all
possibilities
that
are
open.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
same
thing
that
you
are
asking
us
to
agree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mainly
to
reverse
what
the
district
court
has
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
are
right
to
the
district
court
--
didn't
give
you
the
injunction
your
declaration
you
prayed
for.
there
was
error
and
for
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
right.
the
point
is
that
if
your
starting
point
is
right,
this
appeal
is
improperly
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you,
in
fact,
have
an
appeal
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
must
suppose
that
the
ordinary
thing
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
do
or
it
properly
should
have
been
asked
to
do
and
you
did
ask
to
do
but
you
naturally
are
two
straight
steel
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
there
now,
aren't
you?
you're
there
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
you
should
do
this.
i'm
trying
to
explore
all
the
alternatives
that
confronted
court
when
an
appeal
is
improperly
before
it,
if
you
are
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
did
you,
in
your
appeal,
to
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
it
was
not
court
of
three-judge
court?
is
that
your
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
opened
your
brief
which
i
haven't
done
before
not
out
of
disrespect
but
i
don't
do
it
normally,
but
i
noticed
that
here
you
claim
that
is
a
proper
three-judge
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
am
saying
it
wasn't
clear
to
you
until
yesterday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
follow
that
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
claim
has
been
all
--
all
the
way
through
what
you
conce
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
remotely
criticizing
you
or
any
body
else,
but
as
a
tangled
procedure
or
situation,
for
me,
it's
--
it's
perhaps
it
goes
on
because
that
--
that
is
in
need
likes
to
understand
it
fully
without
disposing
of
it
quickly.
you
did
claim
the
basis
of
your
litigation
was
that
the
regulation
is
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
your
claim
now.
it
has
been
all
the
way
through.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
said
that's
a
three-judge
court
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
was
your
complaint?
tell
us.
don't
let
me
guess.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
did
not
--
that
--
the
statutory
materials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
me,
that
makes
no
difference.
not
that
i
don't
know
that
the
plaintiff,
the
complaint
determines
what
you
litigate,
but
since
the
state
--
the
federal
court
sitting
in
the
state
takes
judicial
notice
of
the
state
law,
they
would
know
that
the
state
law
is
against
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
underst
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i
understand
all
that.
it
isn't
too
obscure
for
me
to
understand
it.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
a
state
court
in
mississ
--
where
is
it,
in
georgia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
tennessee,
i
beg
your
pardon.
that
the
--
that
state
court
would
take
judicial
notice
of
the
local
law
and
the
federal
court
takes
judicial
notice
of
the
local
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
would
understand
what
you
did
just
as
to
whether
you
do
understood
it
namely
that
you
regard
the
state
law
as
non-existing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
it
subverts
the
federal
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
this
is
a
case
in
which
you
asked
for
a
declaration
of
rights
as
against
the
existing
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
let's
see
if
i
understand
you.
are
you
saying
that
if
state
officials
take
action
under
what
they
think
is
state
law
when
in
fact
the
action
they
take
is
violative
of
state
law,
does
not
give
a
right
of
--
of
--
does
not
bring
a
case
to
the
federal
court
because
the
state
as
a
state,
thinking
of
it
that
way,
and
apart
from
the
official
who
disregarded
the
--
the
governing
law
of
the
state,
the
state
has
not
deprived
anybody
of
anything,
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
--
we
--
to
me
--
i'm
afraid
--
i'm
afraid
that
the
decisions
of
the
court
in
that
argument
has
never
been
able
to
understand
the
answer
to
that
argument,
but
the
answer
has
been
made
by
controlling
decisions.
that
was
way
back
in
cases
in
which
i
have
dissented
in
which
if
state
officials
violate
what
is
deemed
to
be
state
law,
in
the
opinion
by
justice
holmes,
how
can
you
say
the
state
has
done
anything.
it's
--
because
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
get
your
right
recognized
but
i'm
afraid
that
has
ceased
to
be
the
law
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
give
a
fraction
of
knowing
that
you've
made
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
good
ordinance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
can
i
add
that
--
can
--
can
i
add
that
up
to
say
that
what
you're
saying
is
the
these
particular
officials
of
this
restaurant
--
these
officials
had
been
disobedient
of
your
state
law,
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
all
in
the
city
--
against
whom
is
this
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
are
you
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
answers
were
all
filed
before
burton,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
heiskell,
as
i
understand
it,
you
now
withdraw
your
claim
of
right
to
segregate
on
racial
lines
and
accept
the
burton
decision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
say
you're
within
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
it,
you
can't
defer
but
as
i
understood
you,
after
the
position
of
the
city
solicitor,
with
reference
to
the
city.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
but
as
i
understood
you,
as
i
have
listen
to
you
to
no
effect
and
no
avail,
as
i
understood
you,
it
was
your
position
that
in
view
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
responses
made
with
reference
of
them
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
it
is
your
position
that
segregation
on
racial
law
with
any
of
the
governmental
authorities
of
the
state
of
tennessee
are
no
longer
within
--
are
no
longer
defensible
by
state
law
--
under
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
--
but
you
are
not
here
to
argue
affirmative
defense
there.
you're
not
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
are
you
still
standing
on
the
defense
to
which
the
chief
justice
referred?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
--
you
defend
that
as
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
relevant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
relevance
and
as
before
the
--
the
references
you
made
to
the
various
decisions
by
your
supreme
court
accepting
brown
against
the
board
and
all
that
followed?
what
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
your
position
was.
