what
was
the
last
statement
you've
just
made
that

what
--

mr.

you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief

yes
of
course,
you
have
--
you
haven't
finished
your
time.
chief

because
he
couldn't
afford
to
pay
the
price
that
was
make
him
profit
in
the
ice
cream
business,
is
that
the
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenthal,
may
i
try
to
reduce
it
to
terms
that
seem
simple
to
me.
let
me
put
up
this
way.
the
--
the
fixing
of
the
blend
price
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
farmer
to
see
that
his
prices
are
--
are
stabilized
and
that
he
gets
a
fair
price.
the
establishment
of
the
fund
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
handlers
regardless
of
--
in
order
to
compensate
for
their
different
uses
that
they
make
of
the
milk
and
the
compelling
or
contribution
from
an
outsider
who
comes
in
to
the
district
and
who
is
not
a
pool
handler
is
to
compel
him
to
pay
into
this
fund
so
he
will
not
have
an
unfair
advantage
over
the
pool
handler.
chief
justice

warren
