justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wonder
if
that's
just
your
view,
but
it's
impossible
to
pass
that
you
stated
in
a
summary
about
a
minute
or
two,
why
this
is
essential
in
the
--
in
the
background
and
context
about
which
you're
speaking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
frankly,
i
have
not
been
quite
able
to
understand
some
of
the
arguments,
those
that
have
not
yet
been
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
(inaudible)
the
philosophy
behind
this
and
somewhat
to
seem
if
that
would
reference
to
lehigh
workers
who
do
not
belong
to
the
union,
they
do
not
belong
to
the
union,
they
do
not
contribute
to
the
dues,
they
claim
to
get
the
advantage
of
the
advance
prices
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
that
cooperation,
they
get
in
--
activities,
they
get
an
increased
price
of
stability
of
pool?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
basis
of
it
that
they
could
get
a
stabilized
price
and
an
increased
price
of
the
reason
of
cooperation
if
all
of
them
contribute
to
a
common
fund
called
the
pool?
justice
hugo
l.
black
again,
the
man
who
does
not
belong
to
that
pool,
as
you
pictured
it
out,
one
who
is
not
contributing
to
that
but
who
will
get
advantage
of
it
although
he
does
not
contribute
to
the
lawsuit,
is
that
your
principle?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
i
do
not
understand
yet
why
they
are
hurt?
as
i
gathered
it
in
view
it
was
because
his
occurrence,
the
other
people
contribute
to
and
he
doesn't.
he
gets
the
advantage
of
it
as
though
he
was
a
pool
contributor
when
he's
not.
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
into
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
did
it
fund
out
of
which
you'll
ultimately
comes
in
favor
to
the
compensation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
--
the
--
the
final
objective
of
it
is,
as
i
understand
you,
the
farmers
get
better
prices,
the
most
stable
prices
for
the
milk.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
and
here,
you
have
a
plan
where
about
upon
disputed
but
somewhat
will
do
something
which
would
be
a
loss
but
for
the
fact
that
they
also
recoup
some
other
from
a
pool.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
the
handler
who
doesn't
belong
to
that
and
therefore,
he
doesn't
contribute
to
that
fund.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
(inaudible)
why
this
man
who
is
non-pool
man
wanted
to
be
hurt,
that's
the
question
of
several
of
us
asked
and
maybe
you've
explained
fully
to
theri
satisfaction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
had
and
i
did
which
is
evidently
wrong
because
you
keep
returning
to
the
technical
term,
i
had
an
idea
that
you
have
a
fund
here.
it's
the
idea
of
a
cooperative
fund
for
the
purpose
of
stabilizing
prices.
people
pay
into
that,
they're
required
to
pay
sometimes
more
for
milk
then
--
then
its
worth.
but
they
put
it
in
there,
they
put
all
that
fund
in
there,
they're
going
to
share
them
in
the
benefits
of
these
cooperative
funds
and
this
non-pool
handler
claims
he's
entitled
to
do
that
even
though
he
does
not
contribute
to
that
--
make
the
same
payments
which
you
--
you
said
a
while
ago
that
he
didn't
make
the
same
payment.
i'm
not
talking
about
paying
directly
into
the
fund,
but
through
this
complicated
machinery
of
blended
and
non-blended
and
i,
ii
and
iii.
it
all
turns
out
to
be
a
pool.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
on
that
5
(g)?
i
want
to
ask
you
this
before
you
sit
down.
i
think
i
understand
your
position
and
that's
(inaudible).
it
says
no
marketing
agreement
or
other
order
happens
with
the
milk
and
its
products,
any
marketing
areas
still
prohibit
or
in
any
manner
to
limit
in
the
case
of
the
products
of
milk.
is
it
your
position
that
that
means
that
while
the
secretary
cannot
prohibit,
it
can
put
up
hurdle
to
the
movement
of
milk
in
area
to
another?
