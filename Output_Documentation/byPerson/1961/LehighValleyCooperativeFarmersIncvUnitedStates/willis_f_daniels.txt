mr.
willis
f.
daniels
mr.
chief
justice,
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
litigation
which
has
extended
over
a
long
period
of
time
starting
on
august
1,
1957,
now
comes
before
this
court
and
the
statute
involved
is
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937,
which
is
the
successor
to
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
as
amended
in
1935
following
the
schechter
and
the
panama
oil
case.
also
involved
is
order
27.
now,
order
27
is
an
order
issued
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
establishing
a
marketing
area
and
as
it
was
amended
on
august
1
or
as
of
august
1,
1957,
it
includes
metropolitan
new
york,
some
upstate
areas
and
11
north
jersey
areas.
i
deem
it
appropriate
this
time
to
outline
the
facts
surrounding
these
two
particular
petitioners
before
i
go
into
the
act
in
detail
and
the
order
in
detail.
but
i
might
say
at
the
outset
that
it
is
in
the
minds
of
a
lot
of
people
that
milk
is
a
very
complex
situation.
i
--
in
my
years,
pardon
the
first
pronoun,
do
not
find
it
as
complex
but
this
particular
situation
is
not
going
to
be
very
complex
as
i
see
it.
the
facts
that
i'm
going
to
recite
if
the
court
please,
are
facts
that
were
not
disputed
in
the
promulgation
hearing
or
in
the
review
hearing.
now,
the
review
hearing
is
under
section
15a
and
it
means
that
we
must,
if
we
are
to
agree,
we
must
go
to
the
administrative
agency
for
relief
before
we
can
go
the
court.
we
did
that
on
the
very
first
day
at
9
o'clock
when
the
order
became
effective,
as
soon
as
the
door
is
open
and
we
asked
for
--
for
interim
relief,
but
before
the
15a
was
acted
upon
or
even
heard,
the
government
moved
against
us
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
and
judge
corey
of
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
granted
the
injunction
which
required
us
to
file
reports,
but
made
this
exception
of
we
need
not
pay
the
money
into
the
administrator
or
to
be
distributed
among
the
producers
which
i'll
explain
later,
but
we
should
pay
it
into
the
registry
of
the
court,
that's
what
we
have
done.
as
of
july
31
when
our
briefs
were
filed,
lehigh
valley
had
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court
$617,454
and
suncrest
dairy
$108,767.
now,
how
do
these
petitioners
operate
and
what
is
their
situation?
number
one,
the
lehigh
valley
is
a
cooperative.
it
has
3,400
members,
900
of
whom
are
milk
producers.
lehigh
valley
accepts
all
the
milk
that
their
producers
produce.
they
sell
in
fluid
form,
they
manufacture
cottage
cheese,
they
manufacture
butter
and
they
manufacture
ice
cream.
at
no
time
and
the
record
does
not
dispute
it,
at
no
time
has
lehigh
valley,
since
it
was
organized
in
1935,
diverted
any
of
its
milk
into
the
marketing
area
of
order
27
except
the
milk
it
itself
sells
in
that
area.
lehigh
valley
had
been
doing
business
in
philipsburg
which
is
right
across
the
river
on
eastern
pennsylvania,
philipsburg,
new
jersey
a
short
bridge
of
less
than
a
half
a
mile
i
believe
since
1935.
it
built
its
business
there
and
has
been
there
continuously
ever
since.
lehigh
valley
and
suncrest,
if
the
court
please,
are
not
strangers
to
regulations,
nor
are
we
opposed
to
regulations
per
se,
but
we
do
insist
at
heart
that
the
statute
be
followed
and
the
standards
be
complied
with
and
the
chartered
course
followed,
and
we
do
resist
discrimination.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
mr.
justice
douglas
that
i
was
going
to
explain
when
i
come
to
the
order
that
we
don't
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
thank
you.
now
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
yes.
northern
new
jersey
as
of
august
on
1957,
north
jersey
--
the
marketing
area
of
27
which
was
previously
metropolitan
new
york
since
1938
was
extended
to
take
in
the
11
counties
of
northern
new
jersey,
and
philipsburg
is
one
of
those
counties.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
it
goes
just
on
--
just
north
of
trenton,
it's
the
11
northern
counties
and
comes
completely
over
in
to
the
pennsylvania
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
4,000,000
people.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
no
sir.
i
have
not
raised
that
question.
philipsburg,
new
jersey
has
been
considered
by
the
united
states
census
bureau
and
rightly
so
as
part
of
the
commercial
and
metropolitan
area
of
allentown,
bethlehem
in
eastern
pennsylvania
because
we
have
allentown,
a
few
miles
away
from
bethlehem,
a
few
miles
away
easton,
across
the
bridge,
we
have
philipsburg
and
we've
been
in
there
25
years.
i
just
want
to
establish
that
fact
or
over
25
years
since
1935.
suncrest
is
a
company
that
is
organized
by
combining
two
or
three
smaller
companies,
and
it
has
sold
milk
in
philipsburg
ever
since
or
for
the
last
12
years.
now
then,
how
do
these
two
petitioners
operate?
i
said
they
were
not
strangers
to
regulation.
the
testimony
shows
this
fact
that
we
pay
more
for
fluid
milk
which
is
called
class
1
throughout
this
argument
and
that
we
pay
more
for
fluid
milk
that
we
sell
in
pennsylvania
and
sell
in
new
jersey
than
the
order
27
of
class
1
prices,
fixed
by
the
secretary
and
why
do
we
pay
more
because
the
pennsylvania
milk
control
commission
which
is
in
existence
as
long
as
the
first
agricultural
adjustment
act
in
1933
fixes
the
prices
that
we
pay
for
that
milk
even
though
we
sell
it
out
of
state.
in
other
words,
if
we
bottle
the
milk
in
pennsylvania
and
sell
it
out
of
state,
we
pay
the
price
they
fix
which
is
historically
and
presently
higher
than
the
class
1
price
fixed
of
order
27.
milk
control
commission
of
pennsylvania
is
acting
under
the
authority
of
the
eisenberg
case
with
which
this
court
is
well
acquainted,
and
quoted
in
the
dumont
case,
wood
versus
dumont
with
approval
both
by
the
majority
and
the
two
minority
opinions
so
that
we
pay
more,
i
want
to
fix
that.
we
do
not
divert
any
of
our
milk
into
order
number
27.
those
are
the
salient
facts
concerning
our
operations.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
to
any
other
areas.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
the
ones
that
we
cover
ourselves.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
yes
sir.
well
philipsburg
is
--
the
reason
that
will
come
up
is
this.
an
argument
has
been
made
and
i'm
going
to
answer
it,
that
what
the
provisions
order
27
or
what
they
are,
because
order
27
producers
to
have
a
surplus
and
i
am
now
establishing
as
a
fact
that
we
handle
our
own
surplus
and
the
record
does
not
dispute
it
nor
does
the
government.
no
fact
that
i
have
mentioned
has
the
government
disputed.
the
hearing
examiner
has
found
this
to
be
a
fact.
that
was
the
first
tribunal
we
appeared
before.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
alright.
now
here's
why
they
can't
be,
here's
what
the
order
does.
i
think
i
will
skip
to
the
order,
everybody
knows
the
act,
here's
what
the
order
does.
well,
order
27
was
promulgated
to
become
effective
august
1,
1957
to
cover
northern
new
jersey
and
in
a
nutshell,
here's
what
it
does.
it
classifies
milk,
section
5a
says
it
can.
it
fixes
the
price
for
milk
that
--
and
section
5a
says
it
can
do
that
for
milk
in
the
various
classes,
minimum
prices.
if
the
order
in
answer
now
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question,
then
define
the
word
“handler”
and
then
set
a
pool
handler
--
is
one
--
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
who
has
55%
of
his
milk
sold
in
fluid
form
either
within
the
area
or
without
the
area,
provided
he
elects
to
be
a
pool
handler.
if
he
does
not
elect
to
be
a
pool
handler,
then
he
is
not
a
pool
handler.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
yes,
even
though
he
sells
the
same
amount.
that
was
the
situation
until
august
1
--
september
1,
1958.
then
on
september
1,
1958,
they
turned
the
coin
over,
the
government
did
and
tried
to
say
it
was
25
cent
a
quart.
when
heads
were
up,
when
they
turned
it
over
and
tails
are
up,
it's
no
longer
a
25
cent
quart.
now,
if
you
have
55%
in
class
1
either
in
or
out
of
the
area,
you're
the
pool
plant
unless
you
were
like
not
to
be.
now,
from
august
1,
1957
to
september
1,
1958,
lehigh
valley,
because
it
sold
more
milk
under
official
order
61
regulating
philadelphia
could
not
elect
to
be
a
pool
plant,
mr.
justice
douglas,
under
27
no
matter
what
percentage
of
its
milk
is
sold
in
fluid
form.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
from
august
1,
1957
to
september
1,
1958,
the
lehigh
valley
selling
more
milk
under
order
61,
the
philadelphia
order
than
it
was
selling
under
order
27,
could
not
elect
to
be
a
pool
plant
under
57
--
27
no
matter
if
all
of
its
milk
has
been
sold
in
fluid
form.
now,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
answer
to
your
question,
what
can't
we
do?
we
are
non-pool
plants.
we
have
not
elected
in
first
place
for
13
months
on
--
“i
couldn't
be
a
pool
plant”
and
since
that
time,
we
have
not
elected
to
be
a
pool
plant
or
in
other
words
we
elect
not
to
be.
now,
for
all
the
fluid
milk
that
we
sell
in
philipsburg,
new
jersey,
we
have
to
pay
for
distribution
among
other
producers,
not
our
producers,
the
difference
between
the
class
3
27
price
which
is
the
lowest
price
and
the
class
1
order
27
price
which
is
the
highest
price,
and
it
ranges
from
$2.50
to
$2.80
to
$2.90
or
5
cents
a
quart
so
that
we
can't
go
in
there
without
paying
this
internal
tariff,
tribute
or
whatever
term
you
might
apply
to
it.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
no
sir.
that
in
effect
makes
us
pay
$9
for
our
milk
because
they
give
no
consideration
to
what
we
do
pay
for
and
the
money
we
pay,
this
$700,000
to
july
1st
is
distributed
among
the
producers
who
ship
to
pool
plants,
not
our
producers,
and
they'd
never
had
the
market.
that's
what
we
can't
do.
now,
that's
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
exactly
sir.
and
the
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
of
course,
i
could
avoid
any
reg
--
i
can
--
yes,
yes
your
honor.
i
don't
--
if
i
didn't
sell
it
there,
i
wouldn't
be
regulated.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
definitely.
they
say
this
that
the
compensatory
payment
provision
is
to
compensate,
compensate
for
what?
what
do
they
say?
compensate
for
the
business
for
the
class
1
business
that
the
producers
shipping
to
pool
handlers
would
have
had,
had
we
not
been
there?
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
but
this
--
but
here,
we
didn't
go
in
the
market,
we
didn't
invade
the
market,
we
were
there
long
before
the
order
came,
25
years
before
the
order
was
extended,
we
were
there.
you
can't
compensate
someone
for
something
they
have
never
had.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
if
they
push
us
out
then
of
course
the
pool
handlers
will
pick
up
that
business.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
that's
shipped
to
the
pool
handlers
--
oh,
when
they
ship
as
far
as
20
or
400
miles
away,
we're
only
25
miles
away
or
27
miles
away.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
yes
sir.
section
5a
of
the
statute
says
this;
the
secretary
may
fix
prices,
minimum
prices
for
each
classification
after
he
classified
them.
they
must
be
uniform
and
each
handler
must
pay
those
prices.
the
prices
are
to
be
uniform
to
all
handlers.
well,
they
don't
try
to
stand
on
5a
except
the
lower
court
said
that
5a
didn't
apply
to
us,
so
nobody
tries
to
stand
on
5a,
it's
section
7
(d).
now
7
(d)
was
passed
upon
by
this
court
in
the
rock
royal
case
and
in
the
bernard
versus
stark
speaking
through
mr.
justice
clark.
and
both
courts
have
said
and
the
only
time
that
this
court
has
spoken
on
7
(d),
they
have
said,
“it
is
an
incident”
and
the
word
says
so.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
it's
7
(d).
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
7
(d).
7
(d)
is
the
one
they
rely
on,
and
it
reads
as
follows,
you'll
find
it
on
the
government's
brief
page
62.
incidental
to
that
these
terms
and
conditions,
incidental
to
and
not
inconsistent
with
the
terms
and
conditions
specified
in
subsections
(5)
through
(7)
of
this
section,
and
necessary
to
effectuate
the
other
provisions
of
such
an
order
that
might
be
read.
now
in
bernard
versus
stark
and
in
rock
royal,
it
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
yes
sir.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
i
have
seen
no
one
--
none
of
the
litigation
yet
do
they
claim
that
this
brings
about
uniformity?
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
well,
6
nothing
to
do
with
milk.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
i
say
is
--
the
united
states
district
court
said
and
as
the
hearing
examiner
said
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
section
5a
because
it
does
not
bring
about
uniformity.
uniformity
was
a
cornerstone
of
this
whole
statute.
that
was
the
cornerstone
of
this
whole
statute
because
we
all
know,
the
disruption
of
interstate
commerce,
the
various
prices
paid
as
the
congress
has
said,
any
old
prices
paid
to
get
milk
at
that
time
depending
on
what
the
cash
flow
that
a
particular
producer
needed.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
well,
i
think
i
will
say
that.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
well
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
this
court
--
this
court
sir
said
this
in
the
bernard
versus
stark
case
through
mr.
justice
clark.
he
struck
down
a
provision
which
--
which
disturbed
uniformity
with
this
expression.
we
cannot
find
that
it
is
not
--
not
inconsistent.
now,
these
are
conjunctives
and
it
must
satisfy
all
three
of
them
sir.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
yes,
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
if
there
is
authority
in
the
statute
to
do
it.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
that
case
is
pending.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
right
now.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
i
argued
that
case
as
amicus.
i
was
not
the
principal
but
it
is
still
pending.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
i
presume
--
i
presume
that's
--
i
do
not
know.
however,
the
second
circuit
has
passed
on
this
question
(voice
overlap)
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
this
morning,
i
should
like
not
that
be
misunderstood
in
the
statement
that
i
made
yesterday.
i
made
a
statement
yesterday
that
no
one
has
relied
upon
5
(a)
as
justification
for
this
compensatory
payment
provision.
and
when
i
made
that
statement,
i
was
referring
to
the
five
adjudications
that
have
been
handled
out
upon
this
matter
starting
first
with
the
promulgation
of
the
order
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
the
secretary
agriculture,
which
appears
in
page
700
(a)
of
this
record,
said
this.
“that
in
the
allentown
eastern
area,
the
milk
users
pay
more,
slightly
more
that
than
the
blend
price.”
now
the
blend
price
is
higher
than
the
class
iii
price,
the
class
iii
price
is
the
lowest
price
fixed,
and
the
purpose
of
this
case
is
what
we
called
the
manufacture
price.
now,
class
i-a
is
the
highest
and
the
compensatory
payment
provision
is
the
difference
between
the
class
iii
price
and
the
class
i-a
price
regardless
of
what
the
particular
handler
might
have
paid.
so
that
when
the
secretary,
in
the
promulgation
of
the
hearing,
thought
that
we
pay
more,
we
paid
the
blend
price
which
is
substantially
higher
than
class
iii
and
then
add
to
that,
the
compensatory
payment,
he
is
not
relying
on
uniformity
as
it
is
established
in
5
(a).
now,
the
independent
tribunal,
the
hearing
examiner
mr.
bay,
found
the
same
thing.
mr.
plagune
an
employee
of
the
department
of
agriculture
designated
as
judicial
officer
ignored
that
proposition
entirely
and
reversed
the
hearing
examiner
who
held
in
our
favor,
on
an
entirely
different
matter.
the
district
court
below,
at
pages
223,
224,
225
of
the
record,
held
and
found
as
a
fact
that
we
pay
more
than
the
blend
price
for
the
milk
that
we
purchased
in
the
allentown
eastern
area.
the
lower
circuit
or
the
lower
court,
the
third
circuit,
court
of
appeals,
ignored
5
(a)
entirely
and
said
you
are
not
a
handler
within
the
meaning
of
section
5
(a),
but
the
word
handler
in
5
(a)
means
pool
handler,
but
does
not
mean
a
non-pool
handler.
we
disagree
with
that.
it
might
be
surprising
that
we
do
not
agree
with
it.
if
we
agreed
with
it,
of
course
there'd
be
no
authority
in
the
statute,
in
any
section
to
regulate
non-pool
handlers
because
handlers
and
the
word
handler
appears
only,
not
non-pool.
the
circuit
court
held
that
non-pool
handler
and
pool
handler
were
synonymous.
that
just
can't
be.
if
it
is
then
we
are
not
subject,
pardon
me,
to
any
regulations
whatsoever.
we
contend
that
section
5
(a)
which
is
the
only
pricing
section
so
far
as
milk
is
concerned
in
the
entire
statute.
5
(a)
is
the
only
pricing
section,
and
section
5
(a)
which
is
page
2
of
our
brief,
in
case
of
milk
and
its
products
orders
issued
pursuant
to
this
section
shall
contain
one
or
more
the
following
terms
and
conditions
and
in
parenthesis
(except
as
provided
in
subsection
7
of
this
section
no
others)
no
others.
now,
the
court
must
recall
that
this
act
was
passed
after
the
schechter
case.
it
was
thoroughly
debated
and
it
was
thoroughly
considered
and
as
mr.
justice
clark
has
said
and
it
was
also
said
in
the
rock
royal
case,
the
authority
granted
to
secretary
is
minutely
set
up,
minutely
set
up,
and
set
up
particular
argument.
so
that
we
look
through
all
the
section
5
and
there
is
no
provision
authorizing
the
secretary
to
fix
prices,
except
section
5.
that
is
the
only
section
that
authorizes
price
fixed,
but
it
circumscribes
the
authority
of
the
secretary
because
it
says,
“such
prices
shall
be
uniform
as
to
all
handlers.”
not
uniform
only
as
to
pool
handler,
uniform
as
to
all
handlers.
now
i
shall
like
dwell
just
a
moment
on
this
proposition.
some
courts
previously
have
confused
in
my
opinion,
equal
costs
with
equal
prices.
now,
we
are
not
contending
that
when
the
price
--
when
our
costs
of
the
milk
are
all
totaled
up
that
that
should
be
equal.
we
are
saying
that
what
we
paid
the
producers
directly
or
through
anybody
must
be
equal
so
far
as
minimum
prices
are
concerned.
we're
not
interested
in
premiums
that
are
paid.
we
are
interested
in
what
the
law
says,
the
minimum
prices
and
such
price
shall
be
uniform.
now,
if
it
costs
us
more
after
we
had
paid
for
the
raw
product
then
it
costs
another
dealer,
we're
not
contending
that
the
cost
should
be
equal.
now,
in
the
kass
case,
the
second
circuit
went
further
than
we're
asking
this
court
to
go.
there,
the
court
held
that
the
cost
must
be
uniform,
the
cost
paid
the
producer
and
when
one
handler
bought
it
from
another,
the
cost
include
a
profit
to
that
first
handler.
justice
learned
hand
dissented
in
that
case,
because
he
said
equal
costs
are
not
guaranteed
but
he
did
not
say
equal
prices.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
said
one
method
of
equalizing
the
prices
to
producers
is
through
to
the
compensatory
payment
method,
but
that
compensatory
payment
method
must
bring
about
uniformity
and
that
he
feels
that
it
could
be
defended
only
on
that
graph.
his
position
does
not
differ
from
what
we're
asking
for.
the
third
circuit
said
if
uniformity
applies,
it
applies
with
more
parts
to
the
lehigh
valley
and
suncrest
than
it
applied
in
the
kass
case.
we
are
only
asking
one
thing
that
the
price
established
for
us
to
pay
for
the
raw
product,
be
equal
to
any
other
handler,
pool
or
non-pool.
now,
we're
not
saying
and
we're
not
here
trying
to
frustrate
this
regulation
or
the
statute,
i
said
yesterday,
we
only
want
the
secretary
to
comply
with
the
statute.
and
under
the
cloak
of
complexities,
the
administrative
agency
goes
a
great
ways,
but
we
contend
that
the
complexities
and
complication
arises
when
you
leave
the
basic
standards
established
by
a
statute.
the
secretary
here
fixed
two
prices
--
fixed
prices,
for
two
types
of
handlers
under
his
definition
of
handler
under
the
order
wherein
as
a
handler,
we
filed
reports
as
a
handler.
he
knows
the
amount
of
milk
we
get
and
he
knows
that
disposition
of
our
milk.
he
audits
our
books
and
he
can
determine
what
we
pay.
oh
i
met
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
oh
yes
sir,
oh
yes
sir,
all
of
the
milk
that
we
purchase,
and
we
purchase
it
all,
mr.
justice
harlan,
from
producers
and
we
file
those
reports
every
month.
he
knows
to
the
pound
the
milk
we
purchase
and
he
knows
to
the
ppound
how
we
disposed
of
that
milk
and
he
audits
our
records
that
he
can
find
what
we
pay.
(inaudible)
i'd
like
to
say
right
here
then
all
of
these
tribunals,
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
the
hearing
examiner,
the
lower
court,
the
district
court,
they
all
ignored
the
fact
that
the
pennsylvania
milk
control
commission
fixes
the
prices
that
we
pay
for
milk,
bottled
in
pennsylvania
and
sold
in
new
jersey
and
that
is
higher
than
in
the
class
i
price
fixed
by
order
27.
now
the
class
i
is
the
fluid
milk
what
we
commonly
know
of
as
the
milk
in
bottle.
now,
i
have
shown
it
i
believe
that
the
secretary
did
not
establish
a
uniform
price
for
the
raw
product.
it
is
argued
by
the
government,
he
didn't
fix
the
price
method.
he
did
fix
the
price.
he
fixes
the
price
for
the
pool
handlers
by
a
formula,
not
a
firm
price,
it's
a
formula
and
that
formula
is
made
up
of
10
factors,
wholesale
prices
the
relationship
between
class
i
milk
and
class
ii,
retail
sales
and
a
number
factors,
that
fixes
the
price
for
the
pool
handler.
now,
how
is
a
non-pool
handler's
price
paid?
it's
fixed
by
determining
what
we
pay
and
from
those
reports
and
from
our
books
that
they
audit,
they
can
determine
that
and
then
he
adds
to
that
this
enormous
sum
as
the
difference
between
the
class
iii
and
then
class
i
price
and
that
takes
us
when
they
audit
the
uniform
price
that
he
has
fixed
for
pool
handlers.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
suncrest
does
not.
they
are
not
under
61.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
lehigh,
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
credit
provision,
but
the
district
court
handled
that
situation
this
way
that
the
credit
provision
is
a
(inaudible)
so
to
speak,
i'm
paraphrasing
because
you
can't
buy
the
milk
for
the
class
iii
price.
if
we
take
any
credit,
it
means
that
we
have
to
pay
our
producers
the
class
iii
price
and
we
can't
buy
the
milk
for
class
iii,
and
the
secretary
found
we
couldn't,
and
the
examiner
found,
we
couldn't
and
the
district
court
found,
we
couldn't,
therefore,
he
says
if
amounts
to
nothing.
it
is
simply
a
(inaudible)
and
that
is
true.
we
cannot
buy
it
for
the
class
iii
price.
now
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
we
buy
something
higher
than
--
we
buy
it
something
higher
than
the
blend
price?
actually,
if
the
federal
government
would
have
recognized
this,
i
think
this
court
holds,
they
should
recognize
the
pennsylvania
milk
control
commission
orders
that
pennsylvania
milk
control
commission
orders
fixed
the
class
i
price
higher
than
the
class
i
price
under
article
27,
at
higher
than
the
blend
and
higher
than
the
blend
and
the
pennsylvania
milk
control
commission
does
not
recognize
the
credit.
it
doesn't
recognize
that
credit
for
the
provision,
that
it's
just
in
61
and
there's
grave
doubt
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
that
but
not
being
producers
if
we
can't
raise
that
particular
question.
now,
then
there
is
another
provision
i
must
speak
on,
and
that
is
g,
5
(g).
5
(g)
states
that
the
secretary
may
not
promulgate
an
order
or
promulgate
any
provision
in
an
order,
and
5
(g)
will
be
found
in
our
brief
at
page
26
and
27,
“may
not
promulgate
any
order
that
will
--
that
will
prohibit
the
movement
of
milk
into
any
marketing
area
from
any
production
area
in
the
united
states.”
that
amendment
was
added
after
much
debate,
a
lot
of
debate,
and
chairman
--
mr.
jones,
congressman
jones
who
was
the
manager
of
a
bill
stated
that
the
act
as
it
is
now
drawn,
prohibits
or
does
not
permit
the
secretary
to
write
a
provision
that
would
prohibit
the
flow
them
out.
now,
i
am
staying
out
of
the
milk
products
but
time
is
limited
and
i
have
to
stick
just
to
my
subject.
after
some
considerable
--
after
some
considerable
debate,
congressman
(inaudible)
grison
introduced
an
amendment
and
he
said,
“i
am
introducing
this
amendment
for
this
reason.
one
of
the
things
we
have
to
contend
with
is
the
fact
that
every
state
during
this
depression
period
has
been
setting
up
barriers
in
spite
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
prohibit
the
introduction
in
another
state
of
products
that
it
raises
in
its
own
state.
it
is
high
time
we
set
our
foot
down
on
that.
this
is
the
one
place
where
we
can
very
well
afford
to
put
an
end
to
it.”
now,
(inaudible)
and
the
chairman
said
it
is
much
as
that's
what
the
bill
has
done
already
--
sir?
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
page
26
and
27.
starting
on
page
26
and
27
is
the
statement
of
--
and
the
--
on
page
4
is
(g).
chairman
jones
said
well
i
think
the
bill
already
does
that,
but
for
clarity,
i
have
no
objection
from
the
amendment
being
adopted.
now
that
brings
me
to
what.
it
brings
me
to
this
position
that
the
secretary
cannot
as
a
matter
of
law
find
that
this
compensatory
payment
provision
is
consistent
with
or
it's
a
general
to
other
sections
of
the
statute,
why?
it's
inconsistent
and
cannot
be
found
to
be
consistent
with
(a),
5
(a)
because
it
does
not
bring
about
uniformity.
it
destroys
uniformity.
it
cannot
be
found
to
be
consistent
with
(g),
because
it
prohibits
the
movement
of
milk
from
this
production
area
of
allentown
in
the
phillipsburg
which
is
less
than
25
miles
away,
even
though
milk
comes
in
the
new
york
from
400
miles,
but
they
didn't
use
the
word
prohibit,
but
the
fixed
sets
a
differential
that
we
must
pay.
this
amounts
to
a
prohibition
and
this
court
passed
on
that
in
the
bowman
versus
(inaudible)
case
and
quoted
with
approval
in
the
dumont
case.
and
the
court
said
this
and
this
quote
is
not
in
my
brief.
such
a
power,
that
is
the
power
extrude
milk
by
a
reason
of
high
differentials
or
the
high
price,
if
exerted,
will
set
a
barriers
to
traffic
between
one
state
and
another
as
a
facto
--
as
it
custom
duties
equal
to
the
price
differential
has
been
laid
upon
the
things
transported
and
that's
exactly
what
happens
here.
now,
i
just
want
to
say
one
word
in
further
answer
to
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
yesterday,
our
way
here
attacking
the
authority
and
the
justification
for
the
expansion
of
the
territory
and
i
urged
that
we
were
not.
that
is
not
to
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
we
believe
that
the
extension
of
this
territory
is
proper,
but
it
is
not
raised
in
this
case
because
we
are
not
pool
plant.
being
a
non-pool
plant,
we
would
have
been
met
with
the
fact
that
you
do
not
have
to
be
a
pool
plant
if
you
don't
want
to
and
therefore
electing
to
be
non-pool
plant,
the
territorial
question
is
not
important.
there's
great
doubt
that
the
threes
eastern
counties
--
or
new
--
western
counties
new
jersey
which
belong
to
the
metropolitan
district
of
eastern
bethlehem
and
allentown
or
they
belong
to
the
metropolitan
district
of
phillipsburg
whichever
way,
whether
from
pennsylvania
or
new
jersey,
is
--
is
a
common
commercial
area
and
the
line
should
have
been
drawn
actually,
somewhat
west,
somewhat
east
of
those
three
counties
because
they
have
no
commercial
characteristics
common
to
new
york,
and
jersey
city.
i
like
to
impress
upon
the
court
that
here
are
two
petitioners
in
this
market
moreover
--
whatever
century
one
of
them,
the
other
for
12
years
and
never
has
been
elect
and
never
in
the
record
that
can
be
found
that
we
brought
cheap
milk
into
the
territory.
we
sell
milk
at
the
minimum
prices
fixed
by
omi,
which
is
a
milk
agency
in
the
state
in
new
jersey
as
does
other
happen.
we
always
have
and
now
in
violation
of
a
principal
announced
by
this
court,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
douglas
in
denver
stock
yard
case
a
domain
has
been
established
by
this
board
of
co-ops
that
are
in
here
and
(inaudible).
they
named
a
lot
of
other
co-ops
but
they
are
co-ops
that
go
to
make
up
the
big
ones.
they
say
you
will
leave
this
market
or
you
will
pay
us
the
difference
between
the
class
i
and
the
class
iii
price
so
that
we
may
distribute
it
among
the
producers,
shipping
to
pool
plants
as
though
they
sold
the
milk.
that
is
a
monopoly.
i
assert
for
this
court
of
all
respect
to
the
administrative
agencies
that
unless
they
follow
the
standard
established
and
unless
the
courts
check
them
here
and
--
every
now
and
then
unless
they're
checked.
it's
only
human
nature
that
they'll
go
further
and
further
and
further.
again,
we're
faced
with
this
charge,
leave
the
market
or
chaos
as
that
we
had
the
market
and
i
contend
that
that's
been
condemned
that
the
majority
opinion
in
the
denver
stock
yard
case
and
the
minority
opinions
in
the
denver
stock
yard
case
didn't
disagree
with
the
principal,
a
majority
opinion
written
by
--
the
long
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
joined
him
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
who
also
wrote
a
shorter
opinion
dissenting
opinion,
all
the
dissenting
opinion
said
was,
facts
should
be
established.
the
secretary
should
established
facts.
in
this
case,
the
facts
are
established.
we
took
the
witness
stand
we
testified,
the
testimony
that
i
--
the
facts
that
i
quoted
yesterday
are
all
in
the
record.
i
quoted
no
fact
that
has
not
been
found
in
the
record
some
place
in
a
102-day
hearing
and
found
as
a
fact
by
those
who
have
adjudicated
this
matter.
and
we're
not
asking
--
we're
not
asking
for
any
unfair
advantage.
we're
not
asking
for
a
special
price.
we're
not
asking
to
come
in
there
and
sell
our
milk
at
a
lower
price
that
is
purchasing
at
lower
price
than
our
competitor.
we
are
asking
to
be
permit
the
standard
market
that
we've
been
in
and
willing
to
have
impressed
upon
us,
the
same
rules
and
regulations
namely
uniformity
that
is
impressed
upon
the
pool
handler.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
our
problem
would
not
be
met
because
we
sell
such
a
large
percentage
of
our
milk
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
therefore,
our
utilization,
class
i
utilization
is
higher
than
the
class
i
utilization
of
the
market.
that
is
something
is
only
27
argument.
therefore,
we
even
have
to
contribute
the
difference
between
what
our
blend
was,
the
individual
blend,
and
was
the
market
wide
blend
is.
you
understand
that
the
settlement
pool
is
this,
settlement
upon
the
statute,
all
the
milk
brought
in
to
the
market
area
is
multiplied
to
the
various
class
prices,
that
is
total
up
and
that
is
divided
by
the
total
amount
of
milk
shipped
to
handlers
and
then
that's
a
blend
price,
it's
paid
all
producers.
if
my
individual
price
utilization
comes
higher
i
pay
in,
if
it
comes
lower
i
pay
up
and
they
have
gotten
such
an
abundance
of
milk.
things
cooperatively,
this
large
cooperative,
bring
it
in
from
300
and
400
mils
that
utilization
in
class
i
is
50
--
50%
on
that
slope.
now,
we
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
yes
sir.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
it
would
be
about
75%
to
80%.
in
our
particular
area
--
may
i
continue
your
honors?
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
i
got
a
red
light
and
i
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
alright.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
alright.
in
our
particular
area,
our
utilization
more
run
as
high
as
80%.
it
has
been
found,
that's
not
because
we
fill
milk
on
the
marketing
in
order
27.
that
is
dumped
milk,
triplets.
that's
not
why.
we
had
years
an
intelligent
broker
to
balance
our
supply
with
our
demand
and
when
this
statute
was
passed,
it
was
just
--
it
--
the
project
threatened,
but
then
in
adequate
supply
of
(inaudible)
milk.
today,
the
problem
is
different
and
not
buying
that
educational
program,
they
are
--
they
have
taken
on
so
much
milk
that
now
they
have
to
look
to
other
areas
in
order
to
attempt
to
build
the
utilization
and
they
have
to
build
the
monopoly.
i
don't
accuse
secretary
of
agriculture
of
wrongdoing.
i
accused
him,
however,
of
unwillingly
playing
in
to
the
hands
of
a
situation
which
does
create
a
monopoly
and
that
has
been
condemned.
i'm
sorry
your
honors
(inaudible).
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
attempt
to
answer
some
questions
that
arose.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
it
is
perfectly
true
and
we
have
not
contended
otherwise
that
the
milk
that
is
sold
in
the
area,
that
we
should
pay
the
same
price
for
it,
at
least
the
same
price
for
it
as
handlers,
pool
handlers.
chicago
has
no
compensatory
payment
provision.
anyone
who
sells
milk
in
the
chicago
marketing
area
is
a
pool
plant
and
whether
or
not,
in
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
secretary
could
have
extended
this
territory
to
take
in
part
of
pennsylvania,
would
depend
upon
the
facts
developed
at
the
time.
he
apparently,
as
the
district
court
said,
did
not
find
that
he
should
take
in
this
part
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
he
--
based
his
opinion
or
based
his
decision
on
the
facts.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
alright.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
he
has
--
he
has
a
statutory
authority,
but
of
course
we
must
comply
with
the
statute.
now
then,
the
compensatory
payment
provision
in
the
market
wide
pool
of
the
detroit
area
is
this
type
of
a
compensatory
payment
and
brings
about
uniformity.
the
difference
between
what
the
handler
pays,
the
non-pool
handler
pays,
actually
pays
and
the
price
that
he
would
be
required
to
pay
if
the
provisions
of
the
detroit
order
were
impressed
upon
it,
that
brings
about
uniformity.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
we're
not
quarreling.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
we're
--
we're
not
quarreling
with
that.
we're
not
quarreling
with
that
at
all
sir.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
yes
sir,
it
does.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
now,
in
rock
royal
case,
this
court
said,
“it
is
erroneous
to
suppose
that
the
buying
of
milk
at
less
than
the
minimum,
the
actual
price
paid
for
the
milk
sold
in
the
area
is
reduced.”
in
other
words,
they
say,
in
the
rock
royal
case,
they
said,
“if
you
pay
for
the
milk
equal
to
the
order
price
that
you
pay
that
you
sell
on
the
other
marketing
area
rather
but
you
have
complied
with
uniformity.”
now,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
perfectly
true
as
suggested
to
the
court
that
to
strike
this
provision
down
does
not
make
a
do
way
of
regional
orders.
we
have
regional
orders
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
13
up
and
utah
the
price
established
for
the
milk
according
to
the
area
in
which
you
sell
it
and
that
is
what
is
exactly
meant
in
the
federal
order.
he
can
in
his
regional
orders
but
all
milk
that
comes
in
must
be
treated
as
the
same
--
in
the
same
manner.
as
to
any
authority
to
define
farmers,
dairy
farmers
and
producers
differently,
this
court
in
the
royal
rock
case
and
this
court
in
vernon
versus
--
or
stewart
--
or
wickard
versus
--
stark
versus
wickard
and
again,
in
brandon
versus
stark
at
page
40
of
our
brief
deal
with
the
word
producer
and
milk
farmer
interchange
it
as
does
section
1
and
2
of
the
act.
now
then,
i'd
like
to
address
to
try
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question
how
are
we
hurt.
we
are
hurt
because
we
have
to
take
this
money
out
of
our
treasury,
making
the
milk
that
we
sell
in
phillipsburg,
new
jersey
and
we've
been
there
for
27
years,
i
keep
repeating,
$0.05
should
port
more
than
the
pool
handler
and
we
give
it
to
the
producer
settlement
fund
to
be
distributed
among
other
producers.
there
we're
hurt.
we
asked
and
there
seem
to
be
some
thought
that
we
were
asking
for
something
out
of
the
pool.
we
draw
nothing
out
of
the
pool.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
mr.
just
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
mr.
justice
--
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
the
judge
in
the
district
court
answered
that
rather
quickly.
he
said
it
isn't
the
question
here
of
lehigh
valley
and
suncrest
invading
a
marketing
area.
they've
been
there.
they
established
the
market.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
answered
this
way
by
saying
this
that
because
we're
there,
we
do
not
have
special
privileges.
we
have
to
subject
ourselves
to
regulation
but
the
regulation
that
we
are
willing,
the
regulation
that
we
are
subjected
to
and
the
only
regulation
we
can
be
subjected
to
is
valid
regulation.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
and
uniformity
is
what
that
is
sir.
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
i
don't
understand
what
such
of
a
provision.
what
do
you
mean
sir?
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
this
compensatory
payment
provision?
mr.
willis
f.
daniels
i
think
that
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
because
it
would
be
interfering
with
interstate
commerce
and
discriminating.
i
think
it
would
be
however,
i'm
not
arguing
that
process.
and
i
just
want
to
close
by
saying,
if
your
honors
please
that
this
argument
made
by
government
counsel
that
the
surpluses
drawn
on
the
new
york
market
in
the
flush
period,
since
1952,
a
class
i
utilization
and
new
york
marketing
area
has
been
70%,
the
lowest
or
the
highest
has
been
70%
or
a
little
less
and
the
testimony
shows
un-contradicted
that
we
have
(inaudible)
dropped
of
our
surplus.
and
the
blend
prices
mr.
justice
brennan
that
were
given
by
my
friend
would
of
course
vary
unrealistic
and
cannot
be
found
any
place
or
again,
as
an
actual
fact
they
are
not
the
blend
prices.
