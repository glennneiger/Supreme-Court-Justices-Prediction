mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
question
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
the
compensatory
payment
provisions
of
order
27
are
authorized
by
section
8c
(7)
(d)
of
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937,
as
first,
incidental
to
and
not
inconsistent
with
the
other
terms
of
the
act
and
second,
necessary
to
effectuate
the
other
provisions
of
the
order.
now,
i
would
wish
to
stress
at
the
very
outset,
that
every
administrative
and
judicial
tribunal
which
has
come
in
to
contact
with
this
case
has
had
no
difficulty
in
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
these
provisions
are
absolutely
essential
to
the
affective
operation
of
the
regulatory
scheme
in
--
the
order
27
marketing
area.
now,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
himself
has
made
detailed
findings
as
to
the
necessity.
none
of
these
findings
have
been
challenged
in
this
court
by
the
petitioners
as
like
in
support
in
the
evidence.
the
hearing
examiner,
while
following
the
kass
case
on
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
an
inconsistency
with
the
statute
agreed
that
these
were
desirable
and
even
necessary.
the
judicial
officer,
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
all
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
that
these
provisions
are
absolutely
essential
in
the
affective
operation
of
the
regulatory
scheme
in
the
order
27
area.
now,
where
the
difference
of
opinion
has
been,
and
it's
been
a
difference
largely
which
stems
from
the
kass
case,
has
been
over
whether
these
provisions
are
consistent
with
the
terms
of
the
other
terms
of
the
statute.
in
the
kass
case,
the
majority
of
the
second
circuit
held
they
were
not.
learned
hand
in
his
dissent
thought
that
they
were.
the
district
judge
in
this
case
held
obliged
to
follow
the
kass
decision
although
he
indicated
clearly
that
if
the
question
had
come
to
him
de
novo,
he
might
well
have
reached
the
different
conclusion,
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
did
reach
a
different
conclusion.
now,
we
think,
if
the
court
pleases,
that
the
compensatory
payment
provisions
necessarily
must
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
milk
industry
which
is
a
case
in
federal
regulation
and
the
manner
in
which
the
concededly
valid
provisions
of
order
27
operate
to
meet
the
troublesome
problems
with
which
this
industry
is
faced.
for
as
we
shall
see
the
requirement
of
compensatory
payments
is
rooted
in
many
of
the
same
factors
peculiar
to
the
marketing
of
milk
which
underlie
the
basic
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
can
state
a
summary
would
i
--
would
appreciate
this
if
the
court
would
indulge
me
then
in
a
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
think
if
your
honor
please
that
i
say
that
the
compensatory
payment
provisions
really
cannot
be
understood
unless
the
entire
background
is
--
is
understood.
now,
the
problem
if
i
may
start
and
proceed,
i
think
i
can
--
can
demonstrate
quite
quickly
the
--
fairly
quickly
the
essential
nature
here.
the
problem
with
which
the
milk
industry
is
faced,
of
course
is
the
problem
of
surplus.
and
the
problem
of
surplus
stems
from
the
fact
that
cows
unfortunately
produce
substantially
greater
quantities
of
milk
in
the
summer
time
than
they
do
in
the
winter.
this
means,
since
milk
is
a
highly
perishable
commodity,
that
in
order
to
ensure
a
sufficient
supply
of
fluid
milk
during
the
winter
months,
when
production
per
cow
is
low,
it
is
necessary
to
maintain
herds
which
will
produce
considerable
surplus
in
the
summer
months
particularly
in
june
which
is
the
most
flush
month,
when
production
is
high.
now,
this
surplus
which
necessarily
is
there,
if
you
are
going
to
ensure
that
there
is
enough
milk
to
meet
fluid
demands
in
the
winter
time
can
be
disposed
of
only
in
manufacturing
uses
such
as
butter,
cream,
cheese,
ice
cream.
when
it's
used
for
those
purposes,
it
has
a
very
much
lower
value.
now,
in
the
days
of
the
unregulated
markets,
the
producers
competed
eagerly
for
the
more
profitable
sales
in
the
fluid
milk
market.
and
the
resulting
cutthroat
competition
seriously
engendered
through
the
very
poor
business
practices
which
resulted,
seriously
endangered
the
public
interest
in
wholesome,
adequate
supply
milk
or
an
adequate
wholesome
--
the
supply
of
wholesome
milk
in
the
marketing
area.
now,
the
problem
there,
and
the
problem
today
is
to
find
some
way
of
equitably
distributing
the
burden
of
this
surplus,
that
necessarily
results
from
ensuring
sufficient
supplies
of
fluid
milk
in
the
winter
time,
equitably
distributing
the
burden
of
the
surplus
among
all
of
the
producers.
now,
as
the
court
knows,
state
regulation
and
the
voluntary
endeavors
of
cooperatives
proved
unsuccessful
and
congress
then
entered
the
field
first
in
1935
and
then
through
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937.
now,
insofar
as
this
act
relates
to
milk,
it
authorizes
regional
marketing
orders,
each
order
to
be
especially
adapted
to
the
conditions
of
the
area
in
which
it
is
to
be
effective.
now,
the
basic
function
of
these
orders,
and
this
is
the
function
of
order
27,
is
to
establish
minimum
use
prices
for
milk
and
to
assure
the
payment
of
uniform
minimum
prices
to
the
farmers
by
those
who
were
engaged
in
the
handling
of
milk.
now
to
this
end,
section
8c
(5)
provides
for
the
milk
order
shall
contain
one
or
more
of
these
certain
terms
and
conditions.
the
first
is
the
classification
of
milk
in
accordance
with
its
utilization
such
as
fluid
milk,
as
butter,
as
cheese,
as
ice
cream.
the
second,
the
fixing
or
the
providing
of
a
method
for
the
fixing
of
uniform
minimum
prices
for
each
of
these
used
classifications
which
each
handler
shall
pay
as
a
uniform
minimum
prices,
the
third,
the
payment
of
uniform
prices
to
the
producers
irrespective
of
the
ultimate
use
which
maybe
made
of
that
particular
milk
and
fourth,
the
adjustment
of
the
payments
by
the
handlers
so
that
the
total
sum
paid
by
each
handler
for
the
milk
which
he
purchases
will
not
be
less
than
the
value
of
that
milk
at
the
used
classification
prices,
which
are
established
by
the
marketing
administrator
under
the
order.
now
the
section
goes
on
to
state,
“an
order
shall
contain
no
terms
and
conditions
other
than
those
described
bearing
except
as
provided
in
subsection
7”
and
as
i
indicated
at
the
outsets,
subsection
7
authorizes
the
inclusion
of
auxiliary
provisions
which
are
incidental
to
the
terms
and
conditions
set
fort
in
section
8c
(5)
that
was
inconsistent.
now,
order
27
in
its
initial
form,
as
the
court
may
recall,
covered
new
york
city
and
these
three
suburban
counties,
westchester,
nassau
and
suffolk.
in
1957,
it
was
extended
to
north
new
jersey.
now,
at
the
outset,
the
order
provided
for
the
classification
pooling
and
pricing
of
the
milk
of
all
handlers
who
had
the
authority
--
who
have
the
approval
of
the
local
health
authorities
in
the
marketing
area
to
sell
milk
in
fluid
form
in
the
area.
now,
between
1938
and
1941,
this
was
the
period
of
the
rock
royal
case,
it
was
only
the
milk
of
those
handlers
which
was
actually
sold
in
the
marketing
area
or
which
passed
through
a
plant
in
the
marketing
area,
you
see
which
was
regulated.
all
kinds
of
problems
arose,
this
court
referred
to
some
of
them
in
the
rock
royal
case,
tis
problem
of
pool
price
milk
as
against
unpriced
milk.
in
1941,
the
order
was
amended
to
require
the
pooling
and
pricing
of
all
milk
disposed
off
by
handlers
who
possess
health
authority
approval,
sell
milk
in
new
york
city
or
these
three
suburban
counties,
irrespective
of
whether
the
--
they
actually
were
selling
milk
in
the
area
or
not.
they
had
a
pool
and
price
all
of
their
milk,
sold
inside
of
the
area
or
sold
outside
of
the
area.
this
regulatory
scheme
was
approved
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
titusville
case
but
proved
to
have
a
substantial
disadvantage
and
the
disadvantage
basically
was
this,
under
these
orders
of
course
the
--
this
order,
the
milk
is
classified
of
course
in
class
i,
class
ii
and
the
class
iii,
that's
the
present
form
of
order
27.
the
handler
accounts
under
the
order
as
the
statute
contemplates
for
his
uses
in
each
class.
the
milk
marketing
administrator
then
multiplies
the
amount
of
milk
which
the
handlers
accounted
for
in
each
class
by
the
price
which
has
been
established
for
that
class
and
he
gets
a
total
use
value
for
the
milk
of
this
handler
by
adding
then
the
amount
of
milk
of
each
of
the
three
classes
times
the
class
price.
then
he
does
the
same
thing
for
every
other
handler
and
he
obtains
then
an
overall
total,
you
see,
used
value
on
the
milk
of
those
handlers
whose
milk
is
being
priced
and
he
divides
that
by
the
total
amount
of
milk
that
is
being
priced
and
then
he
gets
around
the
figure
which
is
the
blend
price.
now
of
course
in
the
process,
there
are
certain
additions
and
subtractions
which
are
made
but
none
of
those
are
relevant
here.
now,
the
problem
was
this,
under
the
old
--
under
the
regulatory
scheme
as
it
existed
between
1941
and
1945.
you
might
have
a
plant
or
to
say,
we
take
a
hypothetical
plant
in
massena,
new
york
and
this
plant
is
disposing
of
virtually
all
of
its
milk
in
ice
cream
form
which
is
a
low
value
use.
now,
if
that
plant
--
you
see
we're
outside
of
the
pool,
it
would
have
very
grave
difficulties
in
getting
milk
supplies
because
it
would
be
competing
for
milk
supplies
with
the
producer
--
with
the
handlers,
you
see,
who
were
in
the
pool
and
who
were
paying
the
blend
price
which
of
course
is
higher
since
it's
based
on
a
market
wide
utilization
than
the
low
class
iii
price.
what
he
could
do
however
at
that
time
was
this,
he
comes
down
to
new
york
city
and
he
gets
the
authority
of
the
--
he
gets
the
approval
of
the
health
authorities
to
dispose
of
--
to
sell
milk
in
the
new
york
marketing
area.
does
he
sell
milk
in
a
marketing
area?
oh
no.
he
goes
on
his
business
the
same
way
as
he
was
before,
making
ice
cream,
not
contributing
anything
to
the
fluid
milk
needs
of
the
area,
but
all
of
his
milk
is
pooled
and
priced
because
he
had
the
health
authority
approval.
now,
then
what
he
could
do,
you
see,
is
he
pays
his
producers
the
blend
price
as
he's
required
to.
he
accounts
to
the
producer
settlement
fund
on
the
low
class
iii
utilization
which
he
actually
made
of
the
milk.
then
he
can
draw
out
of
the
producer
settlement
fund,
you
see,
the
difference
between
the
blend
price
and
the
low
class
iii
price
because
all
that
he's
accountable
for
is
the
class
iii
price.
so
the
result
was,
that
the
producers
in
the
area
who
actually
meeting
the
fluid
milk
needs
of
the
area
were
subsidized.
you
see
this
producer
--
this
handler
who
was
not
meeting
the
needs
of
the
area
at
all
and
this
was
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
meant
to
--
i
meant
to
say
the
handlers
were
subsidizing
this
handler
--
well
in
the
sense
it
would
be
subsidizing
the
farmer
too
but
he'd
really
be
subsidizing
the
handler
because
the
handler
probably
could
have
gotten
milk
you
see
at
the
low
class
iii
price
since
he
would
have
been
competing
in
the
area
with
these
other
producers
who
--
and
competing
with
these
other
handlers
who
were
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
well,
for
the
purposes
of
milk
regulation
and
we
will
see
a
--
a
producer
under
the
present
form
of
the
order
is
a
dairy
farmer
who
delivers
his
milk
directly
from
the
farm
to
a
pool
plant.
so
under
the
order
as
--
as
it
presently
constitute
--
is
constituted,
it
is
those
supplier
--
it's
the
supplier
of
the
pool
handler.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
statute,
if
the
court
pleases,
does
not
define
the
terms
producer
or
handler.
the
secretary
has
defined
--
does
not
define
--
secretary
has
defined
the
term
producer
and
we
think
as
we'll
show
correctly
so,
we
think
that
the
secretary's
definition
is
not
only
permitted
by
the
statute,
but
indeed
it
is
required
by
the
provisions
of
the
statute
relating
to
regional
marketer.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
correct,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
statute
contains
no
definition,
whatsoever.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
that
--
that
is
right.
i
may
have
inadvertently
used
the
term
when
i
meant
handler
but
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
certainly.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
he
becomes
under
the
present
order.
he
would
--
if
he
is
not
--
if
he
is
doing
what
he
was
doing
in
my
hypothetical,
no
he
would
not
be
a
pool
handler.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
he
may
or
may
not
that
he
would
--
i
would
suspect
in
depending
upon
the
area
in
which
he's
operating
that
today,
if
he
were,
again,
distributing
nothing
but
--
if
he
was
using
his
milk
nothing
but
ice
cream.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
he
would
find
considerable
difficulty
in
getting
milk.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
because
the
--
on
the
price
which
he
could
get
for
ice
cream
you
see,
he
wouldn't
have
enough
money
available
to
pay
his
farmers
you
see,
anything
around
the
blend
price
which
would
be
the
price
to
--
that
the
producers
participating
in
the
pool.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
and
this
was
this
--
yes,
because
he
you
see
didn't
stand
ready
to
--
at
any
point,
he
was
not
participating
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
fluid-milk
needs
of
the
area.
now,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
regulatory
scheme
is
to
ensure
that
at
all
times
there
will
be
an
adequate
supply
of
wholesome
milk
in
the
marketing
area.
now,
this
man
wasn't
contributing
to
this
hypothetical
plant,
wasn't
contributing
at
all
to
the
supply
of
milk.
now,
what
this
plant
would
have
to
do
today
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
under
this
--
he
would
--
he
would
as
a
matter
of
economics,
i'm
perfectly
certain
you
see,
during
a
--
the
periods
of
relatively
short
supply
of
milk
or
fluid-milk,
he
would
supply
his
milk
to
the
marketing
area
you
see,
and
where
he
was
in
time
of
milk
abundance,
he
might
use
substantial
portions
of
it
for
surplus
uses.
he'd
have
to
do
this
in
order
to
compete
with
the
other
handlers
in
seeking
milk.
now,
because
of
the
in
--
because
of
this
problem,
the
regulatory
scheme
was
changed
in
1945
to
its
present
basic
scheme
and
that
is
that
a
market
wide
pool
was
established
to
which
occasioned
the
regulation
of
a
class
of
handlers
which
have
been
defined
in
the
order
as
pool
handlers.
now,
these
pool
handlers
are
basically
the
handlers
who
are
largely
associated
with
the
marketing
area
and
with
the
fulfillment
of
the
needs
of
the
marketing
area
for
fluid-milk.
in
most
months
of
the
year,
any
handler
who
is
supplying
25%
of
milk
in
fluid
form
--
this
milk
in
fluid
form
to
the
marketing
area
is
required
to
be
a
pool
handler.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
not
--
not
under
the
hypothetical
that
i
establish.
i
would
suppose
again
that
my
massena
man
would
change
his
methods
of
operation,
presumably
too
qualifies.
now,
the
order
then
to
find
its
producers
in
turn
as
those
dairy
farmers
whose
milk
is
delivered
directly
from
the
farm
to
the
pool
plant.
now
--
well,
this
meant
that
no
longer
could
a
handler
who
did,
little
if
any,
business
in
the
marketing
area,
take
advantage
of
the
pool
structure.
a
new
problem
was
presented,
and
that
is
the
problem
of
the
handler
in
the
position
that
the
petitioners
have
occupied
since
the
marketing
area
was
expanded
to
include
new
jersey
in
1957.
this
is
the
handler
who
does
his
principal
business
outside
of
the
marketing
area,
and
therefore
is
not
required
to
become
pool
handler
and
to
price
and
pool
all
of
his
milk.
at
the
same
time,
as
the
petitioners
here,
he
is
selling
some
fluid-milk
in
the
marketing
area
in
competition
with
the
milk
of
the
pool
handler.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
your
honor
--
all
that
i
think
that
they
sell
fluid
–
they
sell
fluid-milk
only
and
in
any
of
event
of
course,
they
would
be
regulated
on
the
fluid
--
they
wouldn't
be
regulated
on
their
sales
of
dairy
products
you
see
in
the
marketing
area.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
class
ii,
they
would
have
to
--
they
would
be
partially
regulated,
yes.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
fluid
milk.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
just
fluid-milk.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
oh
yes
your
honor,
indeed
if
their
sales
were
--
in
most
months
were
25%
in
the
marketing
area,
they
would
be
automatically
pool
handlers
and
they
would
have
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
there
would
be
no
problem
now.
in
their
case,
they
can,
even
though
they
only
sell
4%
to
5%
of
their
milk
in
the
marketing
area,
if
they
want
to,
they
can
become
fully
regulated
pool
handlers
on
the
same
status
as
all
of
the
other
pool
handlers.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
they
don't
--
no,
they
--
they
don't
have
to,
they
can
elect
not
to.
they
are
automatically
pool
handlers
unless
they
make
the
election
not
to
be
pool
handlers.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
but
since
1958,
they
--
both
lehigh
until
1958
could
not
be
a
pool
handler
because
it
was
selling
more
milk
in
the
order
61
area
than
it
was
in
the
order
27
area
and
under
the
then
provisions
of
the
order,
it
did
not
qualify
but
that
restriction
was
removed
in
1958.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no
your
honor,
it
is
not.
the
effect
of
this
provision
is
not
to
make
them
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
secretary
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no
--
no,
they're
not
your
honor.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
be
very
glad
to
your
honor.
the
pool
handlers,
let
us
take
--
i
think
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
it's
not
the
effect.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
reason
it
is
the
consequence
of
this
your
honor.
let
us
take
the
pool
handler
who
--
in
new
jersey
who's
been
regulated
since
1957.
he
is
selling
25%
of
his
milk,
we'll
say
in
the
marketing
area,
75%
outside
and
we'll
say
he
has
got
an
entire
fluid-milk
disposition.
now,
on
every
single
drop
of
his
milk,
25%
in
the
area
or
75%
out
of
the
area
alike,
because
of
his
status
as
a
fully
regulated
pool
handler,
he
must
pay
not
only
the
blend
price
to
his
farmers,
but
he
must
make
a
payment
to
the
producer
settlement
fund
for
the
difference
between
the
blend
price
and
the
class
i
price,
every
drop
of
milk.
now,
this
is
why
lehigh
valley
finds
--
would
find
fully
regulated
pool
status
much
worse
from
an
economic
standpoint
than
the
compensatory
payment
provisions
which
are
provided
for
a
non-pool
handler
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
alright,
yeah.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
alright
i
would
--
well,
of
course
it
will
depend
upon
--
let
us
--
let
us
say
that
this,
that
if
they
are
a
--
back
in
1957,
i
wanted
to
just
get
the
prices
back
at
that
time
because
i
think
that
will
provide
the
--
the
best
manner
of
comparison.
alright,
in
19
--
well,
in
1956,
november
1956,
the
class
i
price
was
$5.81.
now
at
that
point,
you
see
the
class
ii
price
was
$3.90,
the
class
iii
price
was
$3.20.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
hundredweight.
now,
i
don't
know
at
that
juncture,
what
the
--
and
this
is
the
only
thing
in
the
record
--
what
the
blend
price
was.
now,
the
blend
price
will
vary,
as
you
understand,
considerably
from
month-to-month
in
the
summer
time
when
there's
much
more
surplus
milk
being
accounted
for,
the
blend
price
will
be
reduced.
i
could,
if
the
court
would
permit,
use
the
figures
that
--
for
the
present
time
as
well,
but
let
us
assume
which
is
i
think
is
the
fair
assumption
that
--
that
you
have
a
class
i
price
to
$5.81
and
will
make
it
june
perhaps,
at
the
time
with
the
great
deal
of
surplus
and
you
could
readily
have
a
--
have
a
uniform
blend
price
which
would
be,
say
$3.81
or
make
it
$4
roughly.
so
that
would
mean
that
on
every
--
for
a
$4
blend
price
would
mean
that
on
every
hundredweight
of
milk
that
this
pool
handler
in
new
jersey
sells
inside
or
outside
of
the
area
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
75%
and
25
%
alike,
he
would
have
to
pay
a
$1.81
into
the
producer
settlement
fund.
now,
let
us
take
the
non-pool
handler
now.
he
is
selling
as
lehigh
valley
about
4.5%
in
the
marketing
area.
it's
only
on
that
4.5%
of
his
milk
that
he
is
being
regulated
under
order
27.
on
that
4.5%
of
his
milk,
instead
of
the
100%
of
my
pool
handler,
he
will
pay
the
difference
between
then
class
i
price
which
was
$5.81
and
the
then
class
iii
price
which
was
$3.20.
now,
i
haven't
worked
it
out
in
my
head,
i'm
not
very
good
actually
at
mathematics
without
a
piece
of
paper,
but
i
think
it
--
it
becomes
abundantly
clear
from
that
example
that
the
--
it's
to
the
advantage
of
some
one
in
lehigh's
position
and
confronted
with
the
choice
between
fully
regulated
pool
status
and
compensatory
payment.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
percent,
as
opposed
to,
he's
would
pay
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
the
differential
is
larger
for
the
--
for
the
non-pool
handler
in
the
compensatory
payment,
but
that's
only
applying
to
4.5%
of
his
milk
and
the
pool
handler
it's
applying
to
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right,
on
any
milk
which
he
sells
in
fluid
form
in
the
marketing
area.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
well
--
i
think
it's
4.5%,
that's
right,
on
his
4.5%
in
the
marketing
area.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
he
would
pay
$1.81
but
on
the
100%
of
his
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
on
his
total
milk.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right
because
the
pool
handler
--
the
pool
handler
is
subject
to
the
complete
mechanism
of
the
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
this
is
the
non-pool
handler
--
the
non-pool
handler.
this
is
the
lehigh
valley
who
sells
4.5%
in
the
marketing
area
doesn't
need
to
become
a
member
of
the
pool
if
it
doesn't
want
to,
can
if
it
doesn't
one.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
what
happens
to
him
is
this,
on
the
--
and
he's
got
a
total
fluid-milk
disposition
on
--
if
he
is
a
non-pool
handler
on
the
4.5%
of
his
milk
which
he
sells
in
the
marketing
area
and
are
nothing
more,
he
pays
the
difference
between
class
iii
and
class
i
which
at
november
of
1956
was
about
$2.60,
$2.60
on
4%
of
his
milk.
if
he
is
a
pool
handler
fully
regulated,
he
pays
the
difference
each
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
he's
a
pool
handler
on
his
--
total
disposition
of
milk,
he
pays
the
difference
between
the
blend
price
which
in
my
hypothetical
i
think
was
about
$4
and
the
class
i
price
which
is
$5.81
at
this
time
on
all
of
his
milk.
now
the
--
actually
there
--
in
this
case,
it's
clear.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
he
is
a
--
how
--
excuse
your
honor.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
he's
not
better
off
by
becoming
a
fully
regulated
pool
handler
that's
why
lehigh
valley
elected
not
to
become
a
fully
regulated
pool
handler.
now,
the
sec
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
there
is
no
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
he
becomes
a
fully
regulated
pool
handler
under
order
27,
he's
not
under
order
61
at
all.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
at
all.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes,
he
could.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
he
could
make
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
he
could
look
--
yes
indeed,
and
he
could
--
that's
right,
he
could
extend
--
he
could
extend
the
area.
it
was
determined
at
this
time
by
the
secretary
that
the
order
should
be
extended
just
to
these
12
counties
known
in
jersey.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes.
well,
by
extending
--
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
compensatory
payment
provision
as
to
these
pennsylvania
handlers
if
the
order
was
extended
to
the
area
of
the
order
of
the
marketing
--
the
marketing
are
was
extended
so
as
to
embrace
their
principal
place
of
business
within
the
area.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
there
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
be
any
necessity
to
subject
them
to
compensatory
payments.
you
see,
compensatory
payments
are
only
for
the
non-pool
handler,
and
their
purpose
--
their
purpose
is
to
do
away
with
the
competitive
disadvantage
that
in
the
absence
of
compensatory
payments,
you
see,
the
pool-handler
which
is
the
main
stay
of
the
area
would
be
under.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
again
it
would
--
to
these
--
to
these
petitioners?
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
it
--
in
the
case
of
lehigh
valley,
it
would
make
this
difference.
lehigh
valley
is
subject
to
order
61
which
has
a
--
instead
of
a
market
wide
pool
as
does
order
27,
has
an
individual
handler
pool.
now,
the
handler,
unless
it's
a
co-op
and
which
is
exempt
from
doing
it
but
the
co-ops
would
do
it
anyway,
the
handler
does
not
require
to
pay
a
blend
--
the
handler
is
normally
required
to
pay
a
blend
price
to
his
farmers,
but
the
blend
price
in
the
case
of
individual
handler
pool
is
computed
just
on
the
basis
of
that
handler's
utilization.
now,
lehigh
valley
under
order
61
you
see,
the
way
it
now
operates,
it
is
required
to
account
you
see
on
the
basis
of
class
i,
class
ii,
class
iii
prices.
it
so
happens
that
the
philadelphia
class
i,
class
ii,
class
iii
prices
as
the
same
as
new
york
prices,
but
where
it
gets
the
advantage
is,
it
doesn't
have
to
take
in
any
of
the
surplus
of
any
other
handler.
it's
returned
to
its
producer.
it's
based
solely
upon
its
own
utilization
of
milk.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
well
as
to
the
statute
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
it's
burden
it's
--
no
--
the
economic
consequences
would
be
--
would
be
different.
what
it
would
be
doing
in
that
case
would
be
assuming
its
share
of
the
overall
surplus
you
see,
in
the
market
area.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right,
if
it
were
extended.
now,
they
gain
(inaudible)
that
they
have
that
option
now.
they
can
become
a
fully
regulated
pool
handler
if
they
want
to.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
philosophy
your
honor
is
--
is
this
i
think.
and
that
is
that
--
this
is
the
philosophy
underlying
the
compensatory
payment.
it
is
in
a
matter
of
a
really
of
a
club
or
association,
relationship
at
all,
what
you're
doing
--
you're
dealing
here
with
a
group
of
producers
who
stand
ready
willing
and
able
to
supply
the
fluid-milk
needs
of
the
area
in
the
time
of
shortage.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
it's
--
it's
--
they
get
the
advantages
you
see
which
stem
of
course
from
the
equalization
of
the
burden
of
the
surplus
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
he
goes
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
i
don't
think
your
honor
that
is
the
principle
--
what
the
--
what
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
the
advantage
in
the
--
the
advantage
to
the
non-pool
handler
in
the
present
situation
is
this,
the
pool
handler
you
see
cannot
--
on
his
milk
sales,
he
has
to
account
at
these
minimum
prices.
he
then
has
to
pay
into
the
producer
settlement
fund
the
difference
between
the
blend
price
which
she
has
paid
out
to
his
farmers
and
on
his
fluid
milk
sales,
difference
between
the
blend
price
and
class
i
price,
alright.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
into
the
producer
settlement
fund.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
out
of
that
fund
will
come
the
moneys
you
see
to
pay
the
handler
whose
milk
has
gone
for
a
manufacturing
use
you
see,
but
who
has
paid
his
farmer
or
his
producer
rather,
as
he
must,
the
uniform
blend
price.
see
the
objective
--
the
objective
of
this
regulatory
scheme
is
that
each
handler
should
pay
minimum
prices
based
upon
the
use
which
he
makes
of
the
milk.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
precisely,
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
the
--
the
producer
him
--
the
purpose
of
the
producer
settlement
fund
mr.
justice
black
is
to
really
equalize
the
accounts
as
between
handlers.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
now
the
handler
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
but
the
--
the
point
is
this,
that
the
blend
--
the
blend
price
which
is
what
the
producer
gets
you
see
and
which
is
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
used
values
of
all
of
these
handlers,
that
blend
price
reflects
the
utilization
which
is
made
of
milk
by
all
of
the
pool
producer,
by
all
of
the
pool
handlers.
now,
the
problem
is
this.
in
the
summertime
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
but
that
not
with
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right
sir.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
doesn't
--
well,
it
doesn't
keep
the
non-pool
member
out
your
honor.
the
secretary's
rationale
for
the
compensatory
payment
was
this.
he
said
that
if
the
non-pool
handler
did
not
sell
his
milk
in
the
marketing
area
in
fluid
form,
his
most
circumstances
he
would
be
required
to
dispose
of
it
outside
of
the
marketing
area
in
manufacturing
use
form.
now,
he
said
by
the
same
token,
when
the
milk
enters
the
area
there's
already
enough
fluid-milk
you
see,
to
meet
the
fluid-milk
needs
so
that
as
it
enters
the
area,
this
milk
has
and
so
far
as
the
marketing
area
is
concerned
a
surplus
milk
value.
now,
this
is
so
because
since
1953,
if
there
isn't
enough
fluid-milk
in
the
marketing
area
you
see
from
the
pool-handlers
to
meet
the
fluid-milk
needs
of
the
area,
no
compensatory
payments
are
due
from
the
non-pool
handler.
so
the
secretary
said
this.
he
said
that
it's
perfectly
fair
to
treat
this
milk
coming
into
the
marketing
area
as
surplus
milk
because
that's
what
it
could
have
been
disposed
of
outside
of
the
marketing
area,
that's
what
its
real
value
was
in
the
marketing
area.
now
he
said
i
don't,
“i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
and
indeed
i
can't
prohibit
milk
from
entering
the
area,
but
i
want
to
ensure
that
if
the
non-pool
handler
elects,
you
see,
to
sell
the
milk
in
the
marketing
area
as
fluid
instead
of
its
alternative
of
selling
it
outside
of
the
marketing
area
as
surplus
that
he
is
in
advantage
by
that
election
at
the
expense
of
the
pool
handler.
”now,
it
is
at
the
expense
of
the
pool
handler,
because
the
pool
handler
after
all,
he
is
the
one
who
is
bearing
the
surplus
which
is
necessary
--
necessarily
goes
along
with
the
fluid-milk
requirements
of
the
area
and
the
surplus
is
reflected
in
the
blend
price.
when
the
non-pool
handler
comes
into
the
marketing
area
and
sells
fluid
milk,
of
necessity
he
displaces
a
fluid
milk
sale
by
a
pool
handler.
and
equal
quantity
of
milk
has
to
be
diverted
by
a
pool
handler
from
a
class
i
use
and
a
class
i
accountability
to
a
class
iii
use
and
a
class
iii
accountability.
this
reduces
the
blend
price,
and
the
secretary
found
and
it
is
not
challenged
here
that
if
this
milk
is
permitted
to
come
in
without
this
compensatory
payment,
the
blend
price
is
going
to
be
reduced
and
there
is
going
to
be
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
a
pool
handler
to
breakaway
from
the
pool
operations.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
non-pool
handler,
that's
right
--
the
secretary
said
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
you
see
to
give
to
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right,
your
honor
pleases
i'd
like
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
absolutely
right
sir.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
that
is
correct
so
that
the
blend
price
is
preserved
your
honors.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
now,
if
i
may
address
myself
over
this--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right,
but
the
secretary
that
would
--
the
secretary
considered
that
alternative
and
rejected
it
on
the
ground
but
it
wouldn't
be
fully
compensatory
to
the
pool
handler.
it
wouldn't
preserve
the
--
the
blend
price.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
we
--
we
submit
if
the
court
pleases
that
for
some
reasons,
there's
neither
violation
of
8c
(5)
(a)
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
or
8
(5)
(g).
now,
the
--
with
respect
to
(a),
(a)
says
that
the
milk
received
from
producers
uniform
minimum
prices
shall
be
paid
by
each
handler.
now,
under
the
secretary's
definition
of
producer
you
see,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
not
handlers
receiving
milk
from
producers.
now
the
petitioners
say,
“you
cannot
read.”
the
secretary
had
no
authority
to
define
the
term
producer
as
meaning
just
those
farmers
who
are
supplying
to
pool
plants.
if
however,
we
read
the
term
producer
to
mean
all
dairy
farmers
throughout
the
united
states,
that
means
that
every
handler
throughout
the
united
states
must
pay
uniform
minimum
prices,
uniform
minimum
price
to
his
farmers.
in
other
words,
you
would
have
then
of
necessity
a
nationwide
pool
in
which
all
of
the
farmers
would
be
in
the
pool,
all
of
the
handlers
would
be
in
the
pool.
every
farmer
throughout
the
united
states
would
be
getting
this
uniform
minimum
price.
now,
this
would
run
direct
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
if
your
honor
pleases,
section
5
(a)
was
first
to
the
classification
of
milk
and
the
providing
of
the
method
for
the
fixing
of
minimum
prices
for
milk
purchased
from
producers,
such
prices
shall
be
uniformed
as
to
all
handlers.
this
means
the
prices
of
milk
received
from
producers.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
alright,
now
if
it
means
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
if
--
if
you
take
the
term
producer,
then
to
mean
as
anyone
who
is
selling
to
a
handler,
who
is
selling
in
a
marketing
area
to
be
sure
lehigh
valley
and
suncrest
are
in
those
circumstances,
a
handler
purchasing
milk
from
a
producer.
but
if
there
are
handlers
purchasing
milk
from
a
producer
that
means
that
they
must
pay
uniform
minimum
prices
and
account
to
the
producer
settlement
fund
on
all
their
milk.
in
other
words,
they
have
to
become
fully
regulated
handlers.
it
is
only
by
defining
the
term
producer
in
terms
of
the
farmer
whose
milk
is
delivered
to
the
pool
plant
that
there
is
any
possibility
in
the
view
of
the
terms
of
the
statute
of
permitting
handlers
such
as
the
petitioners
here
who
do
their
principal
business
outside
the
marketing
area
you
see,
from
permitting
them
to
remain
free
of
the
pool
regulation
otherwise
follows.
because
if
--
again,
if
lehigh
valley
is
a
handler
receiving
milk
from
a
producer,
then
it
must
under
order
21,
pay
a
uniform
price
to
all
of
its
producers.
you
can't
differentiate
between
the
producers,
you
must
pay
it
to
all
of
them
and
must
accounted
the
producer
settlement
fund,
must
go
through
all
of
the
other
procedures
required
by
the
order.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
if
your
honor,
if
that
is
the
--
if
that
is
the
case,
if
the
secretary
could
not
differentiate
between
the
pool
handler
and
the
non-pool
handler,
the
result
then
is
that
(inaudible)
handlers
purchasing
from
producers
then
he
must
be
treated
exactly
like
the
25%
fluid-milk
distributor
in
the
marketing
area
and
he
must
be
fully
regulated.
the
reason
that
the
secretary
differentiated
between
the
pool
handler
and
the
non-pool
handler
was
not
to
impose
some
large
extraordinary
burden
upon
handlers
in
a
petitioner's
position.
it
was
to
allow
them
to
stay
out
of
because
it
was
more
desirable
for
them
to
stay
out
of
the
scope
of
pool
regulation
and
to
just
--
now,
the
other
aspect
of
course
of
section
5
(a)
is
that
it
all
that
it
requires
is
that
the
minimum
prices
shall
be
uniform
as
to
all
handlers.
now,
as
this
court
itself
has
noted,
noted
in
the
stark
against
wickard,
there
is
no
proscription
in
the
act
against
the
handler
paying
more
than
the
minimum
price
and
indeed,
in
many
circumstances
because
of
economic
conditions
in
the
industry,
there
will
be
a
disparity
between
the
price
of
the
cost
of
milk
between
one
and
another
pool
handler.
for
example,
the
one
pool
handler
will
pays
the
uniform
blend
price
as
they
used,
required
to
do
pay
fine
that
he
cannot
get
milk
at
the
uniform
blend
price
because
of
the
particular
circumstances
which
will
pertain
in
his
area.
so,
he
pays
a
premium.
there's
no
question
at
all
then
under
this
order,
this
fully
regulated
pool
handler
must
still
account
for
the
difference
between
the
blend
price
and
the
class
i
price
even
though
the
effect
is
that
his
total
cost
exceeds
the
uniform
minimum
price
for
class
i
which
the
other
handler,
another
handler
because
he
isn't
forced
to
pay
premiums
does
not
have
to
meet
it.
now,
there
is
not
one
single
reference
any
where
in
section
8c
5
(a)
to
costs
or
to
the
equalization
of
costs.
all
in
it
says
is
that
uniform
minimum
prices
shall
be
paid
by
each
handler.
therefore,
even
if
the
petitioners
here
were
handlers
within
the
scope
of
8c
5
(a),
there
is
no
violation
of
the
--
of
the
statute.
now
with
respect
to
8c
5
(g),
the
section
is
very
careful
to
distinguish
between
milk
and
milk
products.
with
respect
to
milk,
it
only
deals
with
--
it
only
proscribes
the
prohibition
of
the
entry
of
milk
into
a
marketing
area
from
any
production
area.
in
the
case
of
milk
products,
it
proscribes
a
limitation
upon
any
importation.
now,
we
submit
that
by
no
prices
or
can
this
order
be
read
as
a
prohibiting,
the
importation
of
milk
from
anywhere
into
the
marketing
area.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
the
terms
of
this
order,
again
the
petitioners
can
become
fully
regulated
pool
handlers
on
an
absolutely
equal
status
with
all
of
the
other
regulated
pool
handlers
and
bring
their
milk
in.
even
without
becoming
fully
regulated
pool
handlers,
they're
perfectly
free
to
bring
their
milk
in
and
they
have
been
bringing
their
milk
in
over
the
period
of
the
last
few
years.
what
lehigh
does
simply
is
on
this
milk,
it
accounts
to
its
producers
at
the
--
in
figuring
out
the
blend
price
to
its
producers,
it
accounts
for
the
--
at
the
class
iii
price.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
virtually
all
of
the
market
wide
pools,
an
order
setting
up
market
wide
pools--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
as
compensatory
payments
of
this
type.
now,
there
are
33
marketing
orders
throughout
the
united
states
which
have
compensatory
payment
provisions
which
are
identical
to
the
provisions
of
this
order.
there
are
29
orders
throughout
the
country
which
have
compensatory
payment
provisions
which
are
somewhat
different.
in
other
areas,
the
secretary
has
formulated
a
different
basis
of
regulation
where
the
individual
handler
pool
for
example
on
existence
such
as
in
philadelphia.
it
was
found
to
be
no
necessity
for.
each
of
these
orders
is
formulated
after
an
extensive
promulgation
hearing
at
which
is
(inaudible)
the
circumstances
peculiar
to
the
area
involved.
now,
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
in
--
the
order
27
area,
the
secretary
has
found
compensatory
payment
provisions
of
this
type
essential.
the
reasons
for
these
are
set
out
in
detail
in
the
secretary's
findings
in
1953
which
is
set
forth
in
18,
federal
register
8444
at
sec
and
again
in
1957
and
appears
there
in
the
record,
its
pages
752
to
755.
now,
the
secretary's
findings
with
respect
to
what
the
situation
is
in
this
area
and
what
is
necessary
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
pool
in
this
area
are
not
challenged
by
the
petitioners
here.
and
again,
as
i
indicated
at
the
opening
that
everyone
who
has
come
in
to
contact
with
this
issue,
in
this
case,
in
this
context
has
been
in
agreement
--
agreement
that
these
provisions
are
essential
to
the
effectuation
of
this
regulatory
scheme.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
and
we
--
that's
correct
and
we
say
that
--
that
there's
no
violation
of
8
5
(a)
first
because
the
secretary's
differentiation,
in
his
definition
which
is
the
permissible
one,
second
because
8c
5
(5)
does
not
receive
--
require
uniformity
of
costs
but
merely
the
uniformity
of
minimum
prices.
and
there's
no
question
here
that
the
minimum
prices
are
uniform
and
finally
that
the
8c
5
(g)
similarly
is
not
violated
because
this
order
does
not,
by
any
stretch
of
imagination,
prohibit
the
entry
of
milk
into
the
marketing
area.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right
your
honor.
the
legislative
history
clearly
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
differentiate
in
this
regard
between
milk
and
milk
products.
i
would
refer
your
honors
to
a
colloquy
from
the
legislative
history
which
at
page
–
it
appease
at
page
64
of
the
amicus
curia
briefs
submitted
by
the
dairymen
league.
it
appears
therein
that
this
is
one
sentence
that
from
--
this
colloquy
from
mr.
hope,
congressman
hope
in
response
to
a
question
is
to
whether
he
could
prohibit
products
of
milk
being
brought
into
an
area.
he
said
no
but
he
can
prescribe
limitations
on
the
importation
of
fluid-milk
and
just
the
way
that
the
--
this
section
is
set
up
indicates
--
with
this
differentiation
indicates
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
proscribe
the
secretary's
--
prohibit
the
secretary
from
imposing
--
from
promulgating
orders
which
would
have
the
possible
effect
of
limiting
the
importation
of
milk
products
--
of
milk
as
distinguished
from
milk
products.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct
your
honor.
so,
amicus
curia
brief,
it's
at
page
64.
