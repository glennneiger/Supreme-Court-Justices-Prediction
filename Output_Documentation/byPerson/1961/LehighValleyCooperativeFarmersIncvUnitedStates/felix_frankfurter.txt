would
you
mind
restating
that?
justice

that
in
effect
makes
you
a
pool
plant?
justice
felix

what
(voice

that
it
forces
you
to
have
it
more
subsidized

the
producers
and
distributors
would
risk

with
whom
you
have
no
relation
--
justice

now,
would
--
justice
felix

would
you
mind
now
stating
the
statutory
provision
on
which
the
secretary
have
acted
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
what's
7
(a)
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
joined
justice
brennan,
don't
make
an
assumption.
i
remembered
it,
even
the
little
ones
knew.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
break
in
on
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
incidental
to
it
and
i
think
consistent
with
the
terms
and
conditions
specified
in
(5)
and
(7),
you've
just
said
that
everybody
agrees,
they
couldn't
do
this
under
(5),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
6?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
are
you
saying
that
they
issued
an
order
according
to
the
incident
which
you're
not
inconsistent
with
--
that
it
isn't
incidental
--
that
it's
either
incidental
to
and
it
is
inconsistent
with
because
it
is
not
authorized
by
those
other
sections.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
got
to
say
more
than
that
i
think
mr.
daniels,
when
you
get
around
this
tomorrow.
not
only
you
got
to
say
that
it
is
not
incidental
to,
but
i
think
you
have
to
say
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
couldn't
find
that
it
was
incidental
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
you
have
to
say
that,
namely
that
it
was
not
within
the
area
of
this
lawful
exercise
of
judgment
you'll
find
its
incidental.
that
is
that
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

don't
have
to
find.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
i
think
that's
just
the
same
thing
with
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
if
a
person
who
knows
about
these
things
can
say
it
is
incidental
to
or
not
inconsistent
with,
and
one
person
knows
about
these
things,
can
fairly
say
is,
although
another
person
might
say
it
isn't,
this
court
can't
overrule
the
judgment
of
the
secretary,
isn't
that
right?
anyhow,
you
deal
with
it
tomorrow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
exclusively
in
the
order
27.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
mr.
daniels
to
say
that,
the
larger
proportion
of
their
sales
are
in
the
non
27
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
have
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
take
me
up
mr.
rosenthal,
they
don't
have
to
become
pool
handlers
but
the
effect
of
this
--
the
provision
under
contest
is
to
make
them
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
it
doesn't
formally
to
make
them
that
but
the
consequences
are
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
consequences
of
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
please
clear
up
my
ignorance
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
that
that's
the
label
you
put
on
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
consequence
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
that
puts
us
in
sense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
actual
difference
in
sense
between
what
you
exacting
and
what
they
would
be
subjected
to
if
they
were
pool
handlers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
assumed
the
difference
is
not
really
the
amount
but
also
the
total
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
on
his
total.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
one
more
thing
in
connection
to
that.
if
he'd
become
--
if
he
chooses
to
become
a
pool
handler
on
this
non-required
quantity,
and
also
sell
them
--
61
order
61
areas,
is
he
subjected
in
under
the
61
area
to
putting
into
the
compensatory
payment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question,
does
the
secretary
of
agriculture
powered
to
extend
the
geographic
area
within
which
a
milk
order
is
operated,
in
other
words
it
can
be
extend
the
area
of
27
so
that
it
should
cover
pennsylvania?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
he
could
accomplish
the
same
result
by
extending
the
area.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
may
be
other
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
to
be
very
specific,
could
by
extending
the
area
of
order
27,
the
same
result
be
achieved
that
was
sought
to
be
achieved
by
--
by
the
provision
in
conduct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
be
subjected
to
the
things
they're
now
complaining
of
before
extend
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what
difference
in
economics
would
it
be
if
the
order
were
extended
to
embrace
pennsylvania?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
merely
because
the
order
was
so
shaped
by
that
(voice
overlap)
not
because
the
statute
requires
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
by
exercising
the
part
that
you
attribute
to
the
secretary,
he
could
subject
lehigh
to
the
same
economic
burden
of
which
it
is
now
complained
by
merely
extending
the
area.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
did
--
if
he
did
--
would
it
be
--
would
it
be
--
suppose
he
found
on
his
facts
balancing
all
the
consideration,
would
that
be
an
order
beyond
his
powers
in
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
his
judgment
of
what
the
fact
signifies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
facts
doesn't
itself
prove
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
the
question
of
drawing
--
it
isn't
the
question
of
drawing
things
out
of
the
pool
and
suppose
one
agrees
that
you're
hurt
but
the
point
you
have
to
meet,
that
i
take
it
is
that
if
by
being
allowed
to
come
in
as
the
statute
allows
you
to
come
in
on
your
terms,
you
have
a
depressive
effect
upon
the
totality
of
the
market
in
that,
by
nothing
required
to
pay
to
this
fund,
you
affect
those
who
do
have
to
pay
in
it
and
affect
the
market
structure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
real
problem
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
whether
the
secretary
has
the
right
so
define.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
that
an
answer?
why
is
that
an
answer
unless
by
the
implications
that
by
having
been
in
the
market
to
deprive
the
congress
of
the
--
suppose
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
such
a
specific
statute,
do
you
think
you'd
have
a
constitutional
right
to
claim?
you
have
been
there.
the
answer
is
no
and
so
the
question
here
is
whether
the
congress
has
given
this
exacting
power
to
the
secretary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
care
to
express
an
opinion
whether
such
a
specific
provision
by
the
congress
of
the
unites
states
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
means
the
precise
provision
which
you
are
now
attacking.
suppose
congress
passed
the
statute,
which
said
that
anybody
in
your
position
would
--
would
be
subjected
to
this
contribution
to
the
fund.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

unconstitutional
because
you've
been
there?
