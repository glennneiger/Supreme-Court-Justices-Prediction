justice
potter
stewart
mr.
daniels,
before
you
start
in,
i
--
i
noticed
in
reading
all
the
papers
that
in
the
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
it
was
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
case
pending
on
the
sec
--
second
circuit,
involving
this
basic
issue
and
i
wondered
if
you
could
tell
us
what's
become
on
that
case.
i
suppose
i'm
guessing
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
pending
case,
though.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
been
argued,
hasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
get
credit
for
that
charge
under
rule
61
in
your
area,
in
a
rule
61
area?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
the
le
-
lehigh.
justice
potter
stewart
would
your
problem
be
met
mr.
daniels
of
the
milk
that
your
people
sold
in
the
rule
27
area
were
simply
treated
as
pool
milk?
justice
potter
stewart
50%
in
the
order
of
27
area?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
in
the
order
26
area
--
61
area?
justice
potter
stewart
you
used
the
word
producer,
do
you
mean
dairy
farmer
or
do
you
mean
handler?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
be
not
on
--
that
i
follow
not
only
this
argument
but
your
whole
argument
because
there
are
some
in
the
briefs
and
so
far,
in
the
oral
arguments.
there's
been
some
confusion
for
me
at
least
as
to
pool
producer
as
i
thought
that
a
producer
and
a
dairy
farmer
is
the
same
man.
justice
potter
stewart
now
in
the
statute,
how
are
the
words
used?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
under
that
definition
of
producer
is
certain
kind
of
dairy
farmer.
justice
potter
stewart
a
kind
who
sells
to
a
pool
handler?
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
dairy
farmer
who
sells
to
a
handler
who's
not
a
pool
handler,
he's
not
a
producer,
he's
just
a
dairy
farmer.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
contains
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
any
of
that,
handlers
not
a
producers,
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
or
anybody
of
them?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
these
petitioners
sell
only
fluid-milk
in
the
order
27
area
or
do
they
sell
all
three
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
or
how
about
in
class
ii.
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
do
they
sell
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
all
three
classes
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
order
27.
justice
potter
stewart
but
one
of
them
for
doing
a
period
over
here
could
not
become
a
pool
handler.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
hundredweight?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
the
only
question
though,
you're
no
the
5
(a)
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
now
,
if
this
--
if
this,
if
the
milk
coming
to
the
order
27
area,
it
would
simply
treated
as
pool
milk
as
i
suggested
it
in
the
question
then
the
payment
of
the
differential
would
be
between
class
i
and
the
blend
price,
is
that
it,
rather
than
between
class
i
and
class
iii?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
might
--
but
it
might
conform
to
the
statute
whereas
(voice
overlap),
might
not?
justice
potter
stewart
oh
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
don't
get
that
at
all.
(inaudible)
but
i
don't
understand
your
argument
at
all.
this
statute
empowers
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
make
orders
for
various
regions,
for
various
areas.
justice
potter
stewart
subject
to
any
order
which
he
may
like
to
promulgate?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
whole
theory
that
is
that
these
orders
be
regional
and
nationwide.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rosenthal,
as
i
understand
it
at
least
in
many
areas
of
the
country,
the
secretary
in
promulgating
these
various
orders
has
not
found
it
necessary
to
follow
this
device
but
rather
has
treated
milk
to
the
kind
--
we're
talking
about
here
as
simply
as
pool
milk,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
detroit
--
detroit
and
the
chicago
area.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
well
they're
not
a
violation
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that,
you
would
concede
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
within
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
that
--
that
seems
to
at
least
comply
with
your
particular
objections
to
this.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
