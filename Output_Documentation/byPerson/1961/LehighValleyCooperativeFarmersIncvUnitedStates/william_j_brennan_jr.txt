(inaudible)
justice

so
we
were
waiting
for
them,
and
now
they
are
waiting
for
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
may
i
just
ask
one
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
this
massena
fellow
of
yours
now
become
a
pool
handler
by
reason
of
the
qualification
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
where
he
gets
his
milk?
i
thought
you
--
as
i
understand
what
you've
been
telling
me,
by
this
device,
he
has
--
he's
able
to
get
milk
that
otherwise
he's
not
be
able
to
get
because
he
would
pay
under
the
class
iii
price.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
he
is
able
to
get
it,
from
whom
does
he
get
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
your
hypothetic?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
afraid
you've
lost
me
for
a
minute,
maybe
for
good,
but
what
i
don't
quite
understand
is,
you
said
in
this
way,
he
pays
the
blend
price
and
then
actually,
he
gets
back
the
difference
between
what
he's
paid
and
the
class
iii
price,
and
you
characterize
that
as
subsequent
event
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
your
massena
man
couldn't
qualify.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fellow
with
25%
or
75%?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
i
follow.
my
arithmetic
is
not
very
good
either
but
that
sounds
to
me
like
$2.61
difference
on
the
4.5%.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
$1.81,
is
that
what
you're
telling?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
but
does
he
pay
--
he
pays
$2.81
for
hundredweight
on
4.5%
on
the
deduction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
we
were
assuming
this
was
all
class
i
fluid-milk.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
he'd
joined
the
pool,
you're
telling
us
he'd
actually
be
paying
$1.81.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
his
total.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wait,
wait
a
minute.
i
thought
you
said
order
27
regulates
among
these
to
the
4.5%
of
the
selling
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is
the
difference
between
what
happens
when
he
doesn't
want
to,
and
what
happens
and
when
he
does
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
he's
distributing
on
the
4.5%
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he's
not
better
off
but
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he's
not
better
off
but
i
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it
would
then
as
i
understand
it
would
be
--
if
you
did
that
would
not
lehigh
become
automatically
a
pool
handler.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
a
pool-handler,
lehigh
has
been
in
the
position
to
follow
the
$1.81
difference
(voice
overlap)
compensatory
$2.60.
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
that's
mine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
before
you
take
that
5
(a)
now,
let
me
see
i
--
what
my
brother
harlan
had
said,
finally
light
to
him.
was
this
in
effect
that
using
the
figures
you
used
earlier,
suppose
a
blend
price
in
those
56
figures
of
$4
that
without
this
4.5%
of
milk
coming
in,
it
would
be
$4.
with
the
4.5%
coming
in,
assume
it
goes
down
to
380,
these
compensatory
payments
bring
the
fund
back
up
to
the
plan
price
just
to
$4.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
last.
