justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
you
just
say
that
--
can
stipulate
it
that
the
endorsements
are
all
the
same
handwriting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
stipulation
that
the
handwriting,
as
to
each
name,
is
that
of
the
petitioner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so-stipulated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
in
what
more
are
we
going
to
get
examining
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
stipulation
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
government
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
concede
that
the
signatures
of
the
bartfields
are
in
the
petitioner's
handwriting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
different
payees
in
the
bottom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
patterson.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
a
little
puzzled
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
your
colloquy
with
me
and
justice
stewart.
do
i
understand
that
it
is
on
the
government's
position
that
all
three
signatures
were
made
by
the
petitioner
in
his
handwriting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
also
--
i
don't
quite
get
the
consistency
of
that
position,
although
i
think
you
said
to
justice
stewart
namely
that
you
can't
tell
from
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
looking
at
the
signatures,
but
they
are
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
a
little
stupid.
i
can't
follow
this.
if
it's
the
fact
that
one
can't
say,
just
glancing
at
it
is,
that
all
three
are
in
the
same
handwritings,
how
does
that
strengthen
the
government's
position
that
this
is
a
forgery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
follow
it
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
follow
it
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
state
of
the
authorities
where
that
doesn't
appear?
where
the
word
“by”
is
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
--
is
this
it
that
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
law
because,
on
the
facts
as
they
now
appear,
they
made
endorsements
without
the
word
“by”?
this
is
clearly
common
law
forgery
unless
the
signatures
of
the
bartfields
had
been
authorized
and
that
that
was
submitted
as
a
question
of
fact
to
the
jury
on
sufficient
evidence
and
resolved
against
the
petitioner
and,
therefore,
we
ought
to
dismiss
this
as
improvidently
granted?
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
law
is
the
thing
that's
bothering
me.
is
it
because
you
say
that
the
absence
of
the
word
“by”
before
his
signature
on
the
endorsement
makes
this,
if
a
forgery
at
all,
common
law
forgery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
reason
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
reason
you
say
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
forgery,
under
this
statute,
is
a
broader
concept
than
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then,
that
--
which
leaves
in
the
case
only
the
question
of
authority.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
the
jury
on
sufficient
evidence.
