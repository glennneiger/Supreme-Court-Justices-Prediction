mr.
okrand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
also,
mr.
okrand.
is
it
your
position
that
there
must
be
a
disguising
of
signature
before
it
can
be
a
forgery?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
if
i
lose
a
check
and
somebody
just
writes
my
name
without
an
attempt
to
disguise
it,
just
writes
her
own
name
on
it,
wouldn't
that
constitute
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
forgery?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that
position,
but
i
don't
quite
understand
how
far
you'd
go
when
you
say
that
the
three
signatures
were
obviously
the
same
person
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
protect
a
man
from
forgery
if
he
wrote
two
names
and
it
could
be
discernible
that
it
were
written
by
the
same
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
okrand,
they
did
--
they
did
testify
positively,
did
they
not,
that
they
had
not
acknowledged
their
signature
before
the
notary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
notary
was
not
produced.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
notary
was
the
wife
of
the
petitioner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
that
would
be
some
evidence
of
the
fact
that
they
didn't
--
that
they
did
not
sign,
wouldn't
it,
if
a
document
had
attached
to
it
what
purported
to
be
an
acknowledgment
before
the
--
before
a
notary
public
and
that
was
fraudulent,
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
that
--
on
this
part
of
your
case,
mr.
okrand.
do
you
lose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
we've
just
been
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
have
--
you're
not
going
to
argue
the
other
part
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
would
you
state
briefly
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
that
there
was
another
issue.
you
had
raised
another
issue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all,
also
as
to
whether
this
was
for
the
purpose
of
defrauding
the
government
or
not,
even
though
it
was
a
forgery.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
conceding
that
it's
a
forgery
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
that
it
was
your
position
that
it
was
not
defrauding
the
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
i
misunderstood
your
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
any
forgery,
whether
it's
to
defraud
the
government
or
not
come
within
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
it
--
that
is
not
due
from
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
it
--
is
there
--
is
that
issue
in
the
case
or
is
that
out
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
that's
all
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
doesn't
claim
that
the
bartfields
were
not
entitled
to
this
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
patterson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
patterson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
to
say
just
a
moment,
they
didn't
recall
appointing
him
their
attorney.
i
understood
mr.
okrand
to
say
that
they
testified
positively
that
they
did
not
appoint
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
correct.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
the
way
i
understood
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
might
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
misunderstood
you,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
mr.
patterson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
only
thing
that
--
in
the
whole
case
that
indicates
that
it
was
tried
on
the
theory
that
this
was
mr.
and
mrs.
bartfield
by
milo
gilbert
or
is
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
it
was
tried
on
the
theory
that
it
did
say
“by.”
now,
i
wonder,
is
there
anything
else
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
contrary
author
--
substantial
authority
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
not
necessary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
can't
hear
you,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
word
“by”
was
in
there,
are
you
clear
that
it
would
not
be
common
law
forgery?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
patterson,
may
i
ask
you
how
this
case
was
argued
in
the
court
below
that
if
some
--
in
the
trial
court
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
signed
as
trustee
or
whether
he
just
signed
trustee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
ask
is
i
see
there
are
two
defendant's
instructions
that
were
requested
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
of
them
is
a
check
endorsed
as
follows,
“name
of
payee
by
other
as
trustee,”
does
not
constitute
a
forged
instrument
under
usc
title
18
section
495.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
wonder
if
the
court
denied
that
instruction
because
it
didn't
say
“as
trustee”
or
“by
trustee”
or
whether
he
refused
it
because
he
thought
the
law
--
he
thought
it
was
immaterial
whether
it
was
that
way,
as
you
are
arguing
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
it
make
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
it
makes
a
great
difference
if
the
prosecution
considered
that
that
word
“by”
was
in
there
as
it
was
considered
on
appeal,
and
up
until
very
recently,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
jury
was
not
fairly
confronted
with
the
difference
between
the
situation
where
it
just
says
“bartfield,
bartfield,
gilbert,
trustee”
as
distinguished
from
“bartfield,
bartfield,
by
so
and
so,
trustee.”
and
i
think
we're
entitled
--
we
ought
to
be
entitled
to
know
that
because
the
jury
could
be
greatly
misled.
these
instructions
were
asked
and
here
is
another
one
that
was
requested,
the
endorsing
of
a
government
check
by
the
defendant,
by
writing
the
name
of
the
payee
on
the
check
and
below,
the
payee's
name,
the
defendants
name
as
trustee
does
not
constitute
an
offense
under
the
section.
and
another
one,
one
who
executes
an
interest
--
instrument
purporting
on
its
face
to
be
executed
by
him
as
agent
of
a
principal
name
therein
when,
in
fact,
he
has
no
authority
for
such
principal
to
execute
such
instrument
is
not
guilty
of
forgery.
now
to
me,
it
makes
some
difference
as
to
how
the
prosecution
approached
that,
whether
they
say
it
makes
no
difference
to
us,
whether
it
says
“by”
or
just
signs
it
trustee.
and,
the
court
--
i
saw
some
place
here
where
the
court
said
--
i
thought
i
saw
it
in
here
where
the
court
said
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
if
the
supreme
court
had
held
that,
in
such
circumstances,
it
was
a
forgery.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
trial
court?
yes,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
what
i'm
talking
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i'm
talking
about
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
here
it
just
--
this
is
what
i
had
in
mind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
--
the
court
said,
“the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
held
repeatedly
that
forgery
doesn't
mean
merely
adding
a
man's
name.
if
you
put
his
name
down
as
trustee,
when
you
are
not
trustee,
and
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
he
never
was
made
a
trustee
which
the
jury
believed,
that
is
sufficient
and
i
will
instruct
the
jury
as
requested
in
government's
instruction
20.”
now,
he's
telling
the
jury
there,
it
seems
to
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
is
telling
--
telling
the
parties
because
this
was
outside
the
hearing,
i
assume.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
it
doesn't
make
a
particle
of
difference
to
him
whether
the
--
where
the
word
“by”
is
in
there
or
whether
it
isn't,
that
this
court
has
held
that
it
is
not
forgery.
now,
if
the
prosecution
tried
it
on
that
theory
and
said
it
didn't
make
any
difference,
what
--
how
can
we
expect
the
jury
to
make
the
distinction
between
the
two,
as
you
do
here
in
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dorn?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
for
lunch
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dorn,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
available?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
the
complete
record
is
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dorn,
i
--
i
should
know
from
your
argument
but
you
said
there
were
about
8
or
10
checks
all
told,
didn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
some
--
and
that
the
others
--
those
other
than
these
two
saved
by
trustee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
did.
these
are
the
only
two
who
didn't?
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
--
and
all
ten
of
them,
if
there
were
ten,
were
treated
alike
in
the
argument
that
--
of
the
case
same
under
the
instructions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
