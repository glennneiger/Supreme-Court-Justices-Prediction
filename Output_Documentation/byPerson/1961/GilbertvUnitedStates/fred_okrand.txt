mr.
fred
okrand
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
patterson.
the
case
before
this
court
involves
two
counts
of
a
35-count
indictment
which
was
tried
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
two
counts
involved
identical
questions
which,
in
the
view
of
the
petitioner,
are
two.
one,
whether
or
not
the
act
done
by
the
petitioner
amounted
to
forgery
as
a
matter
of
law
and,
two,
whether
or
not
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
and
the
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
case
arose
when
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
petitioner
was
issued
by
the
commissioner
in
los
angeles,
charging
a
violation
of
18
usc
495,
for
the
forgery
of
one
check,
that
check
being
the
subject
of
what
is
now
count
22
of
the
indictment.
this
was
in
january
of
1959.
after
a
--
an
extensive
search
of
the
premises
of
the
petitioner,
numerous
documents
and
files
were
taken
and
a
suit
--
and
an
indictment
was
issued
in
may
of
1959,
charging
22
counts
of
violations
of
various
offenses,
violation
of
false
income
tax
returns
or
others,
forgery
counts,
and
violation
of
18
usc
1001.
thereafter,
in
august
of
1959,
a
superseding
indictment
was
issued,
charging
25
counts,
the
additional
13
--
there
being
--
13
additional
counts
added
to
the
first
indictment.
the
petitioner
was
found
guilty
of
31
of
the
35
counts
and
acquitted
of
4.
among
the
31
were
the
two
forgery
counts
involved
in
this
petition.
thereafter,
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
29
of
the
31
counts
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
obtained
have
been
the
subject
of
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
contrary
to
the
fourth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
2
counts
which
are
present
before
this
court,
namely,
counts
21
and
counts
22.
the
counts
are
identical
and
they
charge
a
violation
of
18
usc
495.had
the
case
been
tried
in
the
other
counts?
mr.
fred
okrand
no,
your
honor.
following
the
decision
by
the
ninth
circuit,
we
took
the
petition
here
and
the
matter
has
not
yet
gone
back.
among
the
counts
that
were
reversed,
however,
there
are
counts
which
are
similar
in
legal
import
to
the
two
which
are
present
here.
counts
21
and
22
which
are
on
page
11
of
the
record,
charge
in
simple
and
concise
language
a
violation
of
18
usc
1495
and
charge
that
on
or
about
a
certain
date,
the
defendant
knowingly
and
willfully
forged
on
two,
in
the
two
counts,
united
states
government
checks,
the
endorsement
and
the
signatures
of
the
payees,
daniel
h.
and
charlene
r.
bartfield.
now,
your
honors,
in
the
record
--
in
the
printed
record
which
is
before
you,
at
pages
83
and
87,
our
photostatic
copies
are
pictures
of
the
two
checks.
it
is
alleged
that
the
petitioner
forged.
when
the
--
we,
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
designated
to
a
--
for
the
purposes
of
the
printed
record,
these
two
checks
and
the
other
three
exhibits
which
are
in
the
record.
and
we're
informed
by
the
clerk
of
this
court
that
they
couldn't
find
the
--
or
that
the
--
these
two
checks,
31
and
32
which
are
on
page
83
and
87,
had
not
arrived
with
the
bunch
of
exhibits
which
had
come
from
the
court
of
appeals.
and,
efforts
were
made
to
locate
these
original
checks
without
success
except
as
i
shall
explain.
when
neither
the
clerk
of
the
court
below
could
find
the
original
exhibits
nor
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
in
los
angeles,
a
photostatic
copy
of
each
of
the
checks
was
obtained
from
the
internal
revenue
service
in
los
angeles
and
forwarded
to
this
court
via
the
district
court
clerk
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
here.
and
so,
the
pictures
that
appear
here
at
pages
83
and
87
are
pictures
of
a
picture.
mr.
dorn,
my
colleague,
arrived
here
early
last
friday
and
went
through
the
exhibits
in
the
exhibit
room
downstairs
and
i,
yesterday,
went
through
them,
and
i
don't
know
what
the
reason
was,
but
the
two
exhibits
are
there.
the
two
original
exhibits,
31
and
32
are
present
and
the
clerk
advises
me
that
they
are
in
the
room
where
the
exhibits
are
kept
for
the
use
of
the
--
of
the
justices.
and,
i
would
ask
that
when
the
court
is
considering
the
case,
if
it
would
please,
look
at
the
original
exhibits
31
and
32
which
are
present,
the
original
checks,
for
the
reasons
that
i
shall
explain.
it
is
our
contention,
number
one,
that
there
is
no
forgery
for
the
reason
that
forgery,
under
section
495
of
title
18,
means
forgery
in
the
usual
and
ordinary
way
that
people
understand
it
to
mean
namely,
a
coming
off,
a
representation
that
something
is
done
by
someone
else
and
not
done
really
by
the
person
who
is
doing
it.
now,
on
pages
83
and
87
of
the
record
are
the
two
checks.
and
if
your
honors
will
notice,
on
the
front
side
of
the
check,
they
are
made
out
with
--
one
of
them
has
two
inaccuracies
in
spelling
which
are
of
(inaudible),
are
made
out
to
daniel
h.
&
charlene
r.
bartfield
c/o
r.
milo
gilbert.
oh,
i
want
to
make
one
other
statement
before
i
discuss
this.
in
the
trial
court,
and
certainly
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
i
had
personal
knowledge,
it
was
the
view
of
everyone
concerned
that
the
endorsements
which
appeared
on
the
back
of
these
checks
were
--
had
the
word
“by”
in
front
of
the
word
“r.
milo
gilbert,”
so
that
it
was
considered
by
all
the
courts
and
the
parties,
in
our
view,
that
the
endorsements
read,
"daniel
h.
bartfield,
charlene
r.
bartfield.
by
r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee."
this
is
the
way
the
case
was
tried.
this
is
the
--
certainly
the
way
it
was
considered
in
the
court
of
appeals.
as
your
honors
will
note
on
the
picture
that's
on
pages
83
and
87
and
as
the
original
do
show
upon
more
careful
examination
by
me
and
mr.
dorn
yesterday.
there
is
no
word
“by”
in
front
of
the
endorsement.
in
our
view
of
the
law,
however,
this
makes
no
difference.
let
me
continue.
the
front
part
of
the
check
says,
"daniel
h.
&
charlene
r.
bartfield
c/o
r.
milo
gilbert,"
that
is
--
those
are
the
payees.
and
on
the
reverse
side
of
the
check,
the
endorsements
are,
"daniel
r.
bartfield,
charlene
r.
bartfield,
r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee."
the
reason
i
ask
the
court
to
examine
the
originals
of
the
checks,
exhibits
31
and
32
which
are
in
the
record
and
in
the
exhibit
5,
is
because
an
examination
of
the
endorsements
will
show
that
they
all
are
all
written
in
the
same
handwriting.
there
is
no
attempt
to
make
a
different
kind
of
a
signature
for
the
named
payees.
it
seems
to
us
clear,
that
any
one
who
looks
at
the
endorsements
can
see
that
they
are
made
by
the
same
person
and
of
course
when
the
case
was
tried,
it
was
stipulated
that
the
endorsements
were
by
the
same
person.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes,
they
were.
they
were
deposited
in
his
account,
an
account
which
is
labeled
"trustee
account."trustee
account.
mr.
fred
okrand
trustee
account,
which
he
--
and
he
deposited
them
in
his
account.
mr.
fred
okrand
there
is
no
difference.
the
two
checks
are
identical.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
we
think
--
mr.
fred
okrand
we
think
it
shows
its
--
it
adds
to
our
claim,
which
we
think
is
apparent
from
the
writing
itself,
that
the
signatures
are
in
the
handwriting
of
the
same
person
and
that
there
is
no
attempt
in
the
writing
itself,
to
palm
off
anyone
else's
handwriting,
which
is
our
view
of
--
of
what
forgery
is.
mr.
fred
okrand
oh,
yes.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
in
the
view
of
the
government
--
in
the
view
of
the
government,
the
--
the
writing
of
the
two
names,
daniel
h.
bartfield
and
charlene
r.
bartfield
was
not
authorized
by
mr.
and
mrs.
bartfield.
and
therefore,
their
view
of
the
law
is
that
if
one
writes
a
signature
of
another
one
without
authorization,
that
that
constitutes
forgery.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
mr.
fred
okrand
so-stipulated.
so-stipulated
to
by
the
--
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
let
me
--
may
i
explain?
perhaps
i've
been
--
i
haven't
been
as
clear
as
i
might.
our
view
of
the
law
is
that
when
a
person
signs
a
check,
endorses
a
check,
and
shows
on
the
check
that
the
payee
himself
is
not
signing
it
but
that
someone
else
is
signing
it,
that
this
does
not
constitute
forgery.
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
exactly
it,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
one
argument
on
one
point.
that's
the
chief
argument
on
one
point.
and,
we
think
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
yes?
mr.
fred
okrand
yes,
we
think
that
--
mr.
fred
okrand
yes,
oh
yes.
mr.
fred
okrand
that
is,
indeed,
forgery
because
it's
a
palming
off
of
somebody
else's
name.
but
if
he
should
write
your
name
and
--
if
i
may
use
my
own
name,
too
--
mr.
fred
okrand
which
would
never
happen,
“by
fred
okrand,”
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
then
it
is
not
a
forgery
because
it
is
not
an
attempt
to
show
that
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
mr.
chief
justice
earl
warren
wrote
that
name.
mr.
fred
okrand
and
anybody
who
looks
at
it
knows
that
fred
okran
wrote
the
name
earl
warren
and
he
acts
upon
my
representation
that
i
had
the
right
to
do
so.
mr.
fred
okrand
well
--
mr.
fred
okrand
if
it
is
very
clear,
and
perhaps
i'm
over
emphasizing
it.
if
it's
very
clear
that
the
last
man
wrote
the
first
man's
name
so
that
the
person
who
gets
it
knows
that
it's
the
last
man
who
wrote
the
name,
this,
in
our
general,
would
not
be
forgery.
but
that
is
really
not
necessary
to
our
case
and
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
sometimes
a
lawyer,
anxious
to
make
sure
that
some
little
point
is
not
overlooked,
overemphasizes
something.
we
say
that
on
this
check,
when
it
is
written
"r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee,"
taken
in
conjunction
with,
one,
the
way
the
check
is
made
out
"daniel
h.
&
charlene
r.
bartfield
c/o
r.
milo
gilbert,"
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
fact
that
the
handwriting
is
all
in
the
same
name,
that
that
shows
to
all
the
world
that
r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee,
wrote
the
endorsement
and
he
is
not
trying
to
tell
anybody
that
daniel
--
bartfield
or
that
charlene
bartfield
wrote
the
endorsements.
and,
in
our
view
of
the
law,
both
at
common
law,
we
think
is
very
clear
and
the
overwhelming
weight
of
authority
in
both
the
federal
and
the
state
courts,
as
we've
tried
to
emphasize
in
our
briefs,
is
to
the
effect
that
that
is
not
--
is
not
forgery.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
the
statute
means
what
it
says.
when
it
said
forgery,
that's
what
it
meant.
and,
the
government
has
attempted
to
say,
well,
it's
a
broad
statute.
it
tries
to
cover
frauds
against
the
government
and
therefore,
it
should
broadly
construe.
indeed,
they
agreed
that
we
correctly
state
what
the
majority
view
of
the
law
is,
and
they
agree
that
most
courts,
in
fact,
i
hesitate
to
say
but
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
a
single
court
which
has
said
that
a
--
an
endorsement
made
in
a
representative
capacity
so
as
it
--
so
as
to
be
shown
at
the
last
signer
is
signing
the
first
name,
i've
been
able
to
find
no
court
which
had
said
that
is
a
forgery.
there
have
been
cases
around
the
question,
but
not
that
specific
question,
and
all
the
cases
that
we've
been
able
to
find
have
all
been
to
the
effect
that
that
kind
of
a
representative
signature
does
not
constitute
forgery.
but,
as
i
say,
the
government
suggests
that
this
is
a
very
broad
statute.
it's
a
fraud
statute.
and
so,
if
he
didn't
have
the
authority
which,
for
the
purpose
of
my
argument
at
the
moment,
we
are
conceding,
but
i
will
get
to
it
--
that
question
a
little
bit
later.
if
he
did
not
have
the
authority,
then
since
this
is
a
fraud
statute,
it
should
be
so
interpreted
to
mean
forgery.
and,
as
i
say,
in
our
view,
it's
a
simple
question
of
what
is
forgery.
we
think
a
common
law
forgery
meant
a
palming
off.
we
think
the
over
palming
weight
of
authority,
statewide,
it
means
the
same
thing.
and,
of
course,
the
selvidge
case,
which
was
decided
just
a
week
before
the
court
below
denied
a
rehearing
to
us,
is
precisely
in
point,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
and
clearly,
it
states
that
to
be
the
law.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
mr.
fred
okrand
to
my
knowledge,
they
have
not.
the
charge
in
the
indictment
is
clear.
it
just
says
forgery.
and
i
think,
this
was
designed,
your
honor,
because
in
some
of
the
other
counts
--
earlier
forgery
counts,
we
--
for
example,
may
i
say
--
i
think
--
yes,
counts
12,
13,
14
--
no,
12
and
--
12,
13,
and
14,
on
pages
7
and
8
of
the
record,
do
use
other
words
in
the
statute.
they
say
"falsely
made,
forged,
and
altered"
in
those
three
counts
but
in
these
two
counts,
the
government
chose
to
state
very
clearly
"forged."
it
makes
no
other
allegation
of
any
kind
as
to
the
crime
by
which
they
are
charging
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
fred
okrand
there
are
numerous
statutes
dealing
with
forgery
in
various
specific
instances.
in
the
chapter
in
which
18
usc
1001
is
located,
there
are,
i
think,
some
half-a-dozen
statutes
which,
in
language
similar
to
this,
make
it
a
crime
to
present
a
false,
forged,
altered,
counterfeited
instrument
to
the
federal
housing
agency
into
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
and
various
specific
kinds
of
documents
which
are
to
be
presented
and
using
much
the
same
language.
but
congress,
of
course,
as
we
say,
knew
what
it
was
doing
when
it
said
forgery,
and
it
meant
forgery
as
everybody
understands
it
to
mean.
i
might
say,
although
i
don't
think
it's
important
and
necessary
for
the
petitioner
to
say
in
order
to
prevail,
that
there
is
no
problem
about
a
man
going
free,
if
he
should
do
something
as
charged
here
on
the
ground
that
there's
no
statute
to
cover
it.
in
fact,
there's
a
much
broader
statute
which
does
cover
various
kinds
of
frauds
which
probably
would
cover
this
sort
of
a
situation
and
18
usc
1001,
under
which
statute
the
government
also
charged
to
petitioner
in
two
or
three
counts
in
the
indictment.

counts
18,
19,
and
20,
the
government
charged
violation
of
18
usc
1001,
so
that
there
--
if
there
is
a
fear,
and
i
say
this
should
not
bear
any
weight
at
all
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
what
petitioner
did
to
violate
495.
but
if
there
is
a
fear
that
in
some
way,
someone
will
get
away
with
something,
providing
the
facts
are
there,
there's
no
cause
for
that
because
other
statutes
are
present
in
which
congress
obviously
intended
to
cover
other
situations.
there
is
one
more
argument
that
i
think
i
should
cover
before
i
conclude
with
this
point
and
that
is
the
argument
that
is
made
by
the
government
posited
upon
the
--
a
position
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals,
namely,
that
the
word
“r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee”
is
a
fictitious
person.
now,
in
our
view,
this
is
not
a
permissible
argument.
we
say
that
“r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee,”
is
not
a
fictitious
person
and
that
it
tells
to
the
casher
of
the
check
precisely
and
exactly
the
truth.
assuming
for
a
moment
and
the
facts
in
the
case
do
not
bear
this
out,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
petitioner
had
absolutely
no
right
at
all
to
this
check
and
no
right
at
all
to
the
money.
nevertheless,
the
endorsement
“r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee”
correctly
states
his
capacity.
this
is
particularly
emphasized
in
this
record
because
of
the
definition
that
was
given
by
the
court
to
the
jury,
if
we
are
to
accept
it
here,
as
to
what
a
trustee
is.
and,
the
court
told
the
jury
that
trustee
meant
one
and
trusted
with
the
property
of
another.
now,
of
course,
that's
exactly
what
the
petitioner
was
saying
here,
namely,
if
the
facts
were
such,
“i
have
the
property
of
somebody
else.”
now,
persons
can
become
involuntary
trustees,
persons
can
become
trustees
whether
they
want
to
or
not,
and
so
when
a
person
signs
a
check
in
this
way,
he
is
saying,
"this
is
not
my
money
and
i
am
--
i
am
the
one
who
is
signing
this
and
holding
to
somebody
else's
money.”
so,
on
that
ground,
we
think
that
the
judgment
below
is
erroneous,
that
this
is
not
a
fictitious
person.
but
this
is
only
an
additional
argument
to
our
other
one,
namely,
that
the
word
"trustee"
shows
that
the
petitioner
is
signing
in
a
representative
capacity,
so
that,
on
two
grounds,
we
think
that
forgery
is
not
shown
here.
mr.
fred
okrand
the
record
does
not
show.
the
only
inference,
and
it's
a
pure
inference,
is
that
it
went
into
the
bank
account
of
the
petitioner,
but
that's
all.
now,
since
your
--
since,
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
asked
that
that
question,
i
might
say
this.
oddly
enough,
these
counts
are,
i
don't
know
if
they're
the
only
ones
but
they're
certainly
among
the
only
ones
in
which
the
government
never
did
claim
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
income
tax
returns
that
were
filed,
anything
wrong
with
the
application
for
the
tax
refund
that
was
filed.
there
is
no
charge
in
the
record
and
no
charge
in
the
indictment.
there
is
no
claim
in
the
record
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
any
of
the
forms
that
were
filed,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
even
suggest
that
the
bartfield's
claim,
that
the
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
the
money.
now,
the
only
thing
that
comes
close
--
the
closest
thing
in
the
record
is
a
question
asked
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
which
he's
asked
mr.
bartfield,
"when
is
the
first
time
you
saw
these
checks,
saw
the
checks?"
and,
mr.
bartfield
answered,
"the
first
time
i
saw
them
was
when
--
when
the
government
men
came
and
showed
them
to
me.”
this
was
after
the
checks
had
been
deposited
and
had
been
cleared
by
the
various
banks.
but
at
no
time
did
mr.
bartfield
say
that
“i
didn't
get
the
money,”
at
no
time
did
mr.
bartfield
say
he
wasn't
entitled
to
the
money.
“he”
meaning
--
by
“he,”
i
mean
the
petitioner.
there
just
is
nothing
of
that
in
the
record
of
any
--
of
any
kind.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
mr.
fred
okrand
in
his
trustee
account.
that's
very
clear.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
the
precise
arrangement
--
i'm
trying
to
stay
away
from
the
evidence
that
the
petitioner
presented
to
make
it
so
very
clear
when
i
get
them
to
the
second
part
of
my
argument,
if
i
get
to
it.
i'll
make
it
so
very
clear
that
there's
no
evidence
against
him.
but
since
the
question
was
asked,
he
worked
on
a
contingency
basis.
if
he
obtained
a
refund
for
his
clients,
he
would
get
paid.
if
he
did
not,
he
would
not
get
paid.
how
much
was
due
him
in
this
case
is
not
in
the
record
at
all.
mr.
fred
okrand
maybe
he
gets
the
entire
or
maybe
he
gets
the
part.
there's
an
inference
that
he
gets
part
in
some
of
the
testimony
that
he
--
that
was
asked
to
him
by
the,
i
think,
by
the
government
attorney.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes,
yes.
there's
oral
testimony
that
the
bartfields
did
not
authorize
him
to
sign
their
names
to
the
check.
mr.
fred
okrand
there
is
oral
testimony
to
that
effect
and
that
come
--
brings
me
to
my
second
point.
this
is
an
interesting
situation,
your
honors.
and,
of
course,
i
suppose,
in
all
--
in
contest
cases
of
this
kind,
this
very
often
happens.
the
bartfields
--
i'm
going
to
my
second
point
now
that
there's
not
enough
evidence.
the
bartfields
testified
that
exhibit
m
which
is
in
the
--
which
is
printed
in
the
record
at
page
106
and
107,
and
a
picture
of
which
was
not
reproduced
in
the
record,
i
don't
know
why,
but
is
attached
to
the
government's
brief.
that
testimony
is
absolutely
clear
that
mr.
--
that
those
are
the
signatures
of
mr.
and
mrs.
bartfield
on
that
power
of
attorney,
a
written
power
of
attorney.
mr.
fred
okrand
on
page
106
and
107
of
the
record.
and,
if
your
honors
will
note,
it's
a
very
broad
power
of
attorney
giving
the
petitioner
the
right
to
take
all
the
steps
necessary
to
prepare
the
forms,
to
endorse
--
to
receive,
deposit,
endorse
and,
otherwise,
negotiate
the
said
refund
checks
at
his
sole
discretion,
including
the
right
of
offset.
so,
it
gives
him
the
absolute
right
to
deal
with
those
funds
and
in
accordance,
of
course,
with
his
disagreement
with
the
--
mr.
fred
okrand
the
body
of
the
power
of
attorney,
the
printing?
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
the
--
yes.
this
is
in
the
handwriting
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
fred
okrand
all
of
it
is
in
the
handwriting
of
the
petitioner
with
the
exception
of
the
signatures
under
“witness
this
hand.”
mr.
fred
okrand
and
the
notary,
that's
right.
now,
it
is
true
that
mr.
and
mrs.
bartfield
testified
in
various
ways
that
they
did
not
remember
signing,
that
they
did
not
remember
the
petitioner
asking
them
to
sign
a
power
of
attorney,
that
they
did
not
--
and,
of
course,
in
an
--
when
mr.
justice
black
asked
me,
and
they
orally
testified
that
they
didn't
appoint
him
trustee,
but
that's
another
point.
now,
it's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
when
an
individual
testifies
that
this
is
his
signature,
that
it
takes
some
little
evidence,
it
seems
to
us,
to
overcome
the
validity
of
that
document
which
he
signed.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
a
criminal
case,
it
isn't
enough
for
an
individual
to
say,
“i
don't
remember
to
signing
it.
he
didn't
ask
me
to
sign
it”
because,
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life,
this
happens
very
often
that
people
don't
remember
having
signed
documents
but
when
they
see
their
signature,
they
know
that
they
signed
it.
and
we
suggest
that
in
ordinary
business
transactions,
when
a
person
sign
a
document
that
they're
bound
by
it
and
they've
got
to
come
in
and
show
something
in
order
to
get
around
the
parole
evidence
rule.
they've
got
to
show
that
--
make
some
kind
of
a
showing
that
either
that
they
didn't
sign
it
and
there's
no
--
there's
just
no
question
about
that.
i
don't
--
i
just
don't
see
how
the
government
can
contend
that
it
was
not
their
signature.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes,
they
did.
there's
no
question
--
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
right.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
but
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
the
power
of
attorney
that's
involved
here
is
what
they
signed,
and
the
purpose
of
the
acknowledgment
is
merely
in
case
the
document
is
to
be
recorded.
mr.
fred
okrand
and
to
give
notice
to
the
other
persons
and
the
law
is
very
clearly.
the
government
doesn't
make
any
contention
otherwise
that
as
between
the
parties,
an
unacknowledged
power
of
attorney
is
valid.
mr.
fred
okrand
it
would
be
some
evidence.
i
think
of
this,
your
honor.if
the
--
if
it
were
a
verification,
rather
than
an
acknowledgment,
if
it
said
the
parties
appeared
of
--
the
ordinary
one,
“sworn
and
signed
in
my
presence”
or
whatever
the
language
is,
and
they
said
they
didn't
do
that,
that
would
be
a
little
stronger
than
our
case
here.
but
here,
is
what
we
--
here,
what
we
have
is
an
acknowledgment
which
is
a
different
kind
of
a
thing.
in
other
words,
very
often,
as
in
california,
a
person
signs
a
power
of
attorney
and
he
may
or
may
not
get
it
acknowledged.
and
then,
he
goes
to
a
notary
public
and
the
notary
public
acknowledges
that
he
said
that
he
signed
it,
you
see,
not
that
he
signed
it
in
my
presence.
and
it's
our
view
that
the
bartfields,
if
this
were
not
their
signature,
they
would've
certainly
said
so.
and
if
i
may
say
so,
having
had
experience
with
the
efficient
office
of
the
united
states
attorney
in
los
angeles,
if
there
were
any
question
at
all
--
any
question
at
all
as
to
whether
or
not
these
were
the
signatures
of
mr.
and
mrs.
bartfield,
the
handwriting
expert
would've
been
there
in
a
minute.
there
just
can't
be
any
question
that
these
were
the
signatures
of
the
bartfields.
now,
the
only
other
thing
then
is,
is
as
suggested
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
as
taken
on
by
the
government,
well,
then,
maybe
it
was
presented
in
blank
or
maybe
it
was
another
document
that
they
were
told
that
they
were
going
to
sign
or
something
like
that.
this
is
conjecture.
this
is
not
evidence
and
we
strongly
urge
that,
certainly
in
a
criminal
case,
that
this
is
not
enough
evidence
to
show
that
he
did
not
have
the
actual
written
authority.
now,
the
only,
the
only
instructions
that
were
given
on
the
question
of
forgery
in
this
case
were
three,
maybe
two-and-a
half.
on
page
71
of
the
record,
the
court
read
18
usc
495.
and
then,
at
page
75
of
the
record,
the
court
gave
these
two
--
these
two
instructions.
i
really
think
they
are
only
one
instruction
that
where
a
tax
account
represents
a
taxpayer,
gets
no
particular
authority
there
from
and
has
to
be
judged
by
the
rules
of
everyone
else.
and
then
this
one,
also
a
power
of
attorney,
which
apparently
the
court
considered
to
be
in
the
case,
to
prosecute
a
claim
against
the
government
giving
authority
to
receive
a
check
in
payment,
gives
the
agent
no
power
to
endorse
and
collect
the
check,
but
this
authority
maybe
given
either
written
or
orally.
well,
the
power
of
attorney
gives
much
more
than
the
power
to
receive
a
check,
one
parenthetical
matter.
the
court
of
appeals
also
suggested
and
the
government
agrees
that
perhaps
the
word
“endorse,”
which
is
inserted
by
way
of
a
little
carrot,
as
your
honors
will
see
in
the
copy
attached
to
the
government's
brief.
it
doesn't
appear
on
the
printed
part.
it
was
added
afterwards.
well
again,
this
is
just
conjecture
and
our
view
is
that
whether
it
was
put
in
afterwards
or
not
put
in
at
all
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
the
power
of
attorney
was
so
broad
that
it
would
covert
the
right
to
endorse
and
even
collect
the
check.
mr.
fred
okrand
we
asked
for
three
but
two
instructions
--
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
yes.
in
this
forum,
your
honor,
we
asked
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
for
this.
i'll
see
if
i
can
find
them.
we
asked
for
these
two
instructions
which
were
--
which
were
not
given.
mr.
fred
okrand
page
20,
at
the
bottom.
one
who
executes
an
instrument
purporting
on
its
face
to
be
executed
by
him
as
an
agent
of
a
principle.
no,
we
didn't.
no,
those
two
instructions
had
to
do
with
our
theory
of
viewing
--
mr.
fred
okrand
the
record
does
not
show
that.
and
so
on
the
two
points,
we
think
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
prevail.
one
that
there
is
no
evidence
because
we
think
that
this
kind
of
evidence
of
a
person
coming
in
and
saying,
“i
don't
remember”
would
throw
the
business
community
into
havoc,
it
seems
to
me
--
it
seems
to
us.
if
a
person
signs
a
document,
he's
bound
by
it
unless
he
can
show
some
overreaching
but
he
has
to
show
it,
and
we
just
don't
think
that
that's
shown
in
this
record.
and
of
course,
if
we're
wrong
on
that,
and
if
the
--
and
remember
this,
your
honors,
if
you
will
please,
this
is
not
a
question
of
conflict
in
evidence,
as
we
view
it
and
as
the
government
seeks
to
put
it.
this
is
the
evidence
of
the
bartfields
alone.
this
is
the
evidence
of
the
government's
witnesses,
their
testimony.
i
have
astute
relying
upon
the
evidence
as
testified
to
by
the
petitioner
which,
as
your
honors
can
well
imagine,
was
--
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
right,
as
trustee
but
the
question
of
the
power
of
attorney
part,
the
remembering
of
the
--
whether
they
signed
it,
the
remembering
of
whether
they
were
asked
to
sign
a
power
of
attorney,
that
was
--
that
was
equivocal.
that
was
ambiguous.
but
if
your
honor
is
quite
correct
that
as
to
whether
they
testified
with
--
very
quickly
that,
by
yes
or
no
answers,
that
they
did
not
give
him
the
authority
to
act
as
trustee
in
the
legal
sense.
mr.
fred
okrand
i
don't
think
the
government's
argument
to
the
jury
is
printed.
but
i
was
not
there
personally,
but
my
recollection
of
it
when
i
read
it
before
the
court
below
was
of
course
to
the
effect
that
--
well,
maybe
something
else
was
done.
i
really
ought
not
to
say
that
because
this
is
so
hazy
and
mr.
dorn
who
tried
the
case
would
know
better
than
i.
it's
not
printed
in
this
part
of
the
record.
and
so,
with
that,
your
honor,
we
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
remaining
time
we
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
fred
okrand
which
part,
your
honor?
the
--
mr.
fred
okrand
the
power
of
attorney?
mr.
fred
okrand
no,
oh
no.
mr.
fred
okrand
we
argue
--
i
thought
i
argued
it
at
the
beginning.
if
you
--
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
as
to
whether
or
not
the
power
of
attorney
can
be
given
effect
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
then,
we
still
win
in
our
judgment.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
because
the
endorsement
itself
on
the
backs
of
the
checks,
as
i
started
out
in
my
argument,
as
a
matter
of
law
is
not
forgery
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
because
it
is
not
a
palming
off,
an
attempted
--
an
attempt
to
say
that
somebody
else
did
this
signature.
it
is,
at
the
most,
a
misrepresentation
of
authority
to
sign
the
names
of
other
persons
which
is
not,
as
we
view
the
cases
and
which
we
have
outlined
in
our
briefs,
forgery
either
at
common
law
or
under
the
statute.
i
hope
i
made
myself
--
mr.
fred
okrand
no,
there
are
just
two.
mr.
fred
okrand
well
--
mr.
fred
okrand
no,
no.
mr.
fred
okrand
oh
no.
mr.
fred
okrand
oh
no.
no.
if
i
did,
i
misspoke
myself,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
okrand
if
it's
a
forgery,
if
as
a
matter
of
law
this
is
forgery,
they
have
--
they
indicted
him
for
forgery
under
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
commit
forgery
and
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
on
our
power
of
attorney,
then
forgery
was
committed
and
that's
it.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
the
way
this
particular
statute
reads,
the
forgery
must
be
for
the
purpose
of
getting
money
from
the
government.
mr.
fred
okrand
and
--
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
i
think
that's
what
it
means
and
--
mr.
fred
okrand
i
think
it's
out,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
say
that
it's
in,
but
i
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
it
hasn't
been
argued
that
way
all
the
way
through
and
we
can't
say.
mr.
fred
okrand
but
it's
--
however
--
however,
it
is
very
clear
though
that
there's
no
claim
that
this
was
as
a
result
of
any
fraudulent
income
tax
transaction.
there
just
is
no
claim
and
--
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
exactly
right,
and
the
bartfields
never
in
--
never
claimed
anywhere
that
mr.
gilbert
was
not
entitled
or
whatever
he
got,
although
what
he
got
is
not
shown
in
the
record.
we
don't
--
we
just
don't
know.
we
don't
know
whether
he
got
any
or
whether
he
got
all.
thank
you.
