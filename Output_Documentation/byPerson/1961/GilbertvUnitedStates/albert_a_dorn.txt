mr.
albert
a.
dorn
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
justices.
i
think
i'm
in
a
somewhat
fortunate
position
being
here
as
i
am
responsible
for
having
represented
the
defendant
in
the
trail
court
and
have
tried
the
case.
i
think
i
can
state
with
complete
fairness
and
categorically,
that
the
case
was
tried
by
the
prosecution.
it
was
considered
by
the
defense
and
by
the
trial
court
that
these
checks
were
signed
in
a
representative
capacity,
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
court
below
denied
the
defendant's
instructions
to
which
the
chief
justice
has
just
alluded
to,
that
the
court
--
the
trial
court
believed
the
law
to
be
that
when
a
check
shows
on
its
face
that
it
is
signed
in
a
representative
capacity,
that
that
constitutes
forgery
under
495.
mr.
albert
a.
dorn
if
it
pleases
the
court.
before
lunch,
i
indicated
to
the
court
the
theory
under
which
the
case
was
tried
in
the
trial
court.
that
the
theory,
the
factual
--
at
least
supposition
was
that
all
of
these
checks,
and
by
the
way,
i
think
we
had
possibly
8
or
9
or
10
other
checks
involved
in
separate
forgery
counts,
that
all
of
the
checks
were
signed
in
a
representative
capacity
but
that
the
trial
court
clearly
indicated
as
shown
by
the
record
that
the
trial
court
considered
that
nevertheless,
if
there
was
no
authority
either
oral
or
written,
that
that
constituted
forgery
under
the
appropriate
section
of
the
code.
in
the
arguments
to
the
jury,
the
question
was
always
considered
in
the
light
that
the
checks
were
signed
in
a
representative
capacity.
mr.
albert
a.
dorn
yes,
they
were.
mr.
albert
a.
dorn
they're
not
before
this
court.
mr.
albert
a.
dorn
yes.
i
believe
they're
in
the
record,
however,
in
the
transcript.
mr.
albert
a.
dorn
yes,
it
is.
mr.
albert
a.
dorn
yes
your,
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
dorn
these
two
checks
which
were
involved
now
before
this
court,
were
actually
considered
by
both
counsel
trying
the
case
as
the
least
important
of
all
counts
because
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried,
well,
shortly
prior
to
that
time,
the
government
had
possession
of
the
power
of
attorney
which
is
defendants
exhibit
m.
this
power
of
attorney,
along
with
many
other
powers
of
attorney
together
with
what
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision,
characterizes
as
thousands
of
documents
were
seized
and
characterized
by
the
circuit
court
as
illegally
seized
from
the
defendant
based
upon
the
--
a
complaint
issued
on
one
of
the
checks
which
is
now
before
this
court
so
that
the
government
had
the
power
of
attorney
in
its
possession
for
quite
some
time.
there
was
never
any
contention
that
the
power
of
attorney
itself
was
forged
or
illegally
procured
or
anything
else
of
that
nature.
the
power
of
attorney
was
simply
admitted
in
evidence
at
that
time
and
not
too
much
attention
was
paid
to
it.
the
question
of
these
two
counts,
i'm
sure,
were
intermingled
with
the
evidence
on
33
other
counts
involving
difficult
factual
questions,
involving
complicated
tax
returns.
and
these
two
counts,
as
indicated
by
the
record,
the
testimony
is
very
brief.
some
question,
i
think
is
made
by
counsel
as
to
whether
the
answer
of
the
bartfield's
was
equivocal
or
not.
actually,
he
says
that
he
did
sign
the
power
of
attorney.
he
said
the
signature
of
his
wife
looked
like
her
signature.
she
says
it
appears
to
be
her
signature.
and
there's
nothing
more
ever
said
about
it.
insofar
as
the
appearance
of
the
endorsement
of
the
check
itself,
although
in
the
trial
court
and
circuit
court
of
appeals,
it
was
considered
without
question
that
the
checks
on
their
face
indicated
they
were
signed
in
a
representative
capacity.
although
that
was
without
question,
nevertheless,
i
think
the
most
that
can
be
said
about
it
in
this
court
is
that
from
the
government's
standpoint,
it
presented
a
jury
question
and
i
think
the
jury
at
least
were
entitled
to
decide
whether
these
checks
were
signed
in
a
representative
capacity
or
not.
i
think
as
pointed
out
that
it
was
not
on
the
face
of
the
check
and
on
the
back
of
the
check
at
least
to
present
that
question
of
fact
which
should
have
been
given
to
the
jury.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
because
of
the
instructions
of
the
court
and
the
refusal
of
the
court
to
give
the
defendants
free
instructions
which
were
refused.
the
jury
could
not
decide
that
question
because
it
would
--
could
never
be
presented
to
the
jury
on
that
basis.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
i
think
the
common
law
is
clear
as
to
what
forgery
actually
means.
i
think
it
seems
apparent
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
palming
off
of
the
signature
of
the
payee
by
the
defendant.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
the
record
will
clearly
indicate
that
not
only
we
didn't
concede
the
signatures.
we
said
those
signatures
all
written
all
of
the
checks.
there
was
never
any
issue
made
about
it.
the
defendants
signed
all
those
names.
you
see
on
the
other
checks
and
those
checks
all
in
the
record,
they
are
in
--
they're
in
evidence
and
they
are
in
the
exhibit
file.
all
of
those
checks
show
the
same
pattern.
they
were
signed
by
the
--
the
payee,
defendants
signed
their
names
by
himself,
trustee.
all
of
these
checks
went
into
the
same
place.
they
went
into
the
defendants
trustee
account.
there
is
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
what
was
done
with
all
of
these
checks.
as
to
what
happened,
i
think
the
question
was
asked
here,
as
to
what
happened
with
the
funds
in
these
particular
two
checks.
the
only
evidence
which
is
in
the
record
is
that
these
funds
went
into
this
--
into
this
trustee
account
which
was
to
be
--
be
dispersed
in
the
regular
course
of
his
business.
the
evidence
does
not
disclose
whether
those
funds
were
ever
dispersed
to
the
payees
or
not.
but
nevertheless,
there
was
no
claim
ever
made
in
the
trial
court
that
those
funds
were
handled
improperly
by
the
defendant.
there
was
never
any
--
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
payees
ever
made
any
claim
to
anybody
at
anytime
that
the
funds
were
used
improperly
or
improperly
dispersed.
there
was
never
any
claim
made
that
a
second
claim
was
made
to
the
government
by
the
payees
for
payment
on
these
checks.
there
was
no
claim
ever
made
that
the
payees
never
received
any
of
their
--
the
proceeds
of
these
checks.
i
think
if
the
record
is
examined
as
to
the
defendant's
explanation
of
how
these
checks
were
handled
and
the
funds
dispersed,
they're
all
done
in
the
usual
course
of
his
practice
in
business.
and
there
was
never
any
claim
that
was
anything
proper
about
it.
there
was
never
any
claim
in
the
trial
court.
there
was
never
any
argument
concerning
this
--
these
particular
counts.
all
that
was
before
the
trial
court
insofar
as
these
two
counts
are
concerned
are
simply
the
two
checks
which
were
quickly
put
in
evidence,
quickly
stipulated
that
the
payees
did
not
sign
them,
that
the
defendants
signed
them
as
it
signed
all
the
other
checks.
so
that
the
checks,
in
our
view,
never
gave
nor
in
--
were
intended
to
give
the
appearance
of
containing
the
actual
signature
of
--
of
the
payees.
i
think
it's
apparent
from
the
whole
case
itself
that
was
never
the
intention.
and
therefore,
cannot
fall
within
the
classical
confines
of
forgery.
counsel
had
cited
various
cases
but
i
think
i
can
state
to
the
court,
there
isn't,
in
my
view,
one
case
that
i
know
of
which
says
that
a
case
of
this
nature
is
forgery
under
the
statute
such
as
its
involved
here
as
counsel
has
pointed
out.
england
had
amended
its
statute
to
specifically
put
into
their
statute
the
words
without
authority.
now,
i
think
it
ought
to
be
pointed
out.
there
were
two
types
of
endorsements
which
are
possible
if
a
man
has
authority.
he
may
either
--
if
he
has
authority,
he
may
either
--
either
sign
the
payees
name
with
nothing
more.
now,
if
he
has
authority,
that
is
not
a
forged
endorsement
and
that
authority
can
either
be
oral
or
written.
if
he
has
no
authority,
then
that
is
clearly
a
forgery
that
we
don't
question
about
it.
but
where
a
man
signs,
endorses
a
check
with
the
payees
name,
and
some
place
on
that
check,
it
is
indicated
that
he's
not
attempting
to
palm
off
the
signature
of
the
payee
as
the
signature
of
the
payee
but
indicates
that
he
is
signing
the
representative
capacity
classically
in
all
the
cases
we've
been
able
to
find,
it
clearly
indicates
the
forgery
statute
doesn't
encompass
that
kind
of
a
situation.
the
most
that
can
be
said
--
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that,
that
person
signing
that
check
in
that
fashion,
is
indicating
to
the
world
that
he
signed
the
payees
name,
not
that
the
payee
signed
it,
but
he
signed
it,
but
that,
he
then
puts
the
person
unnoticed
as
to
his
authority.
and
i
think
justice
stewart
raised
the
question
as
to
what
the
bank's
attitude
would
be
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
the
bank's
attitude
in
that
type
of
a
situation
when
it
receives
a
check
which
it
understands
is
side
in
a
rep
--
representative
capacity,
then
it
is
--
they
must
then
satisfy
themselves
as
to
the
authority
of
the
person
signing
that
check
because
if
they
are
wrong,
if
the
authority
doesn't
exist,
then
they
would
be
liable
to
the
next
endorsement
on
that
check.
they
would've
guaranteed
all
the
previous
endorsements.
but
i
submit
to
the
court
classically,
and
it
is
not
the
law
that
such
an
endorsement
constitutes
a
forged
instrument.
if
any
legislature
accuses
to
include
within
their
definition
of
forgery,
a
forgery
without
authority,
that,
i
submit
to
this
court,
would
have
to
be
a
matter
of
legislature
action
and
not
of
judicial
interpretation.
