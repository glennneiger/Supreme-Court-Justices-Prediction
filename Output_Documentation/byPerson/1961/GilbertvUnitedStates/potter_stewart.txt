were
these
checks
deposited
to
mr.
--
to
the
petitioner's
account?
justice
potter
stewart
the
several
verbs
in
the
statute,
in
addition
to
forge,
there's
“whoever
falsely
makes,
alters,
forges,
or
the
counterfeits
any”
and
then
it
goes
on.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
government
make
any
claim
that
any
of
those
other
verbs
are
applicable
here?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know.
these
checks
represented
refunds
to
the
bartfields
as
a
result
of
alleged
overpayment
of
their
income
tax.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
were
--
the
checks
were
cashed
by
the
petitioner
and
deposited
to
his
account.
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
it
--
doesn't
it
follow
that
he
was
not
entitled
or
is
it
your
theory
that
this
was
his
fee
for
making
up
their
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
kind
of
an
interesting
contingency
that
if
he
gets
a
refund
for
his
clients,
he
gets
the
entire
refund.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
notary
signature.
justice
potter
stewart
they
did
identify
these
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
pictures.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
nobody
questioned
them
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
no
evidence
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not
suggested
by
anybody
that
these
were
not
their
signatures,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
maybe
these
had
been
signed
in
blank
or
something.
i
didn't
know
there
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
any
suggestion
of
whether
these
were
not
their
signature
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
anybody.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
remember
that.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
first
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
first
opinion,
they
--
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
didn't
show
any
awareness
that
there
was
any
purported
power
of
attorney,
isn't
that
correct?
and
that's
had
to
be
called
to
their
attention
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
not
concede,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
--
that
it
is
apparent
on
the
face
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
the
back
of
the
check
that
these
were
all
three
in
the
same
handwriting.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
what
led
the
bank
to
put
these
funds
in
his
account.
the
payees
were
mr.
and
mrs.
,
what's
their
name?
justice
potter
stewart
bartfield?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
the
payees?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
endorsed
it,
purportedly,
that
is
their
names
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
back
of
it
in
blank,
and
that's
what
made
for
check
the
same
as
cash,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
came
his
name
as
trustee,
but
there
was
no
direction
to
pay
to
the
order
of
him
as
trustee
or
anything
else,
even
purportedly
signed
by
the
bartfields.
i
don't
know
what
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
probably
isn't
very
important
to
this
case,
but
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
may
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
converts
it
into
money.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
wasn't
all
here,
but
it
was
all
--
it
belonged
entirely
to
whoever
held
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
it's
your
basic
position
that
the
question
on
--
which
was
presented
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
not
really
here
in
this
case.
