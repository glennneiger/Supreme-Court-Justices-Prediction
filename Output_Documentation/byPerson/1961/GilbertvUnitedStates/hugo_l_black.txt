hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
now,
what
is
the
particular
significance
of
the
difference
between
the
two
checks
from
your
standpoint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
--
why
do
you
ask
that
we
look
at
the
original
which
i
have
in
my
hand?
what
do
you
think
that
shows
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
we
need
to
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt,
but
do
i
understand
you
--
what
your
argument
is
that
if
i
lose
a
check
payable
to
me
and
somebody
gets
it
or
they
steal
it
and
they
put
my
name
on
it
by
them,
that
that
would
not
be
forgery?
justice
hugo
l.
black

that
your
chief
argument
in
the
case?

there
testimony
that
the
bartfields
did
not
authorize
him
to
sign
their
names
to
the
check?

page
is
that?

black
did
you
ask

l.
black
did
you
ask,
on
this
particular
point
to
which
you
refer,
about
the
power
of
attorney?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
accept
to
that
charge
on
the
ground

did
not
include
the
other
words
that
you
say
should've
been
in
there?
