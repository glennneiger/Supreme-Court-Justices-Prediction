mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
view
this
case,
there
is
basically
one
question
presented
by
the
facts
and
that
is
simply
why
the
evidence
sustained
petitioner's
conviction
for
violation
of
18
usc
495.
that,
however,
subdivides
itself
into
two
further
questions,
whether
the
evidence,
viewing
certain
facts
and
certain
remarks
by
the
court
of
appeals,
is
sufficient
which
has
been
argued
partially
orally
and
partially
by
briefs
in
this
case,
sustained
the
evidence.
and
secondly,
the
legal
question
whether
this
form
of
an
endorsement
constitutes
a
forgery
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
now,
i
apprehend
that
the
court
is
interested
in
the
legal
question
rather
than
the
particular
factual
questions
presented
by
this
case,
and
which
has
yet
have
not
been
fully
argued
but
which
are
in
petitioner's
brief.
i
would
like,
however,
to,
first,
clear
the
path
as
to
the
factual
questions.
and
later
on,
i
will
discuss
the
legal
questions
because
there
will
of
course
be
no
opportunity
to
reply
anything
that
is
said
hereafter
on
these
factual
questions.
so,
let's
get
a
little
or
full
picture
of
what
the
facts
in
this
case
are.
the
only
counts
remaining
before
this
court
placed
are
counts
21
and
22
of
the
indictment.
count
21
charges
that
on
june
2,
1958,
the
petitioner
forged
a
certain
united
states
government
check
payable
to
the
--
to
charlotte
--
he
forged
the
names
of
daniel
h.
and
charline
r.
bartfield
to
a
certain
united
states
government
check
in
the
amount
of
$800,
first
obtaining
that
money
from
united
states
government,
its
officers
and
agents.
count
22
makes
similar
charge.
the
only
difference
is
the
amount
of
the
check
is
$500.
the
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
government
supporting
these
counts
was
fairly
brief.
the
only
witnesses
to
testify
for
the
government
were
the
two
bartfields
and
they
both
testified
substantially
the
same.
they
said
that
they
employed
petitioner,
who
is
a
tax
accountant
or
a
certified
public
accountant
who
does
that
kind
of
work
to
assist
them
in
preparing
their
1955
and
1956
income
tax
returns.
they
did
not
authorize
him,
to
their
knowledge
at
least,
to
collect
any
refunds.
they
did
not
constitute
him
their
attorney.
they
did
not
constitute
him
their
trustee.
the
government
started
to
show
mr.
bartfield
one
of
these
checks
and
ask
him
whether
the
endorsement
on
the
back
was
his.
at
that
point,
defense
attorney
said
that,
in
order
to
save
time,
it
would
be
stipulated
that
all
endorsements
on
the
back
of
both
checks
were
made
in
the
hand
of
the
petitioner.
so,
that
element
of
the
case
was
out
for
these
two
counts.
now,
the
real
issue
of
fact
came
up
on
this
power
of
attorney
which
was
shown
to
the
bartfields
by
defense
counsel
on
cross
examination.
we
have
set
forth
this
power
of
attorney
as
it
was
originally
written,
a
photostatic
copy
of
it,
as
an
appendix
to
our
government's
brief
in
this
case.
it
might
pay
to
spend
just
a
couple
of
minutes
looking
at
that
power
of
attorney
so
we
won't
have
to
go
back
at
--
to
it
any
further.
the
form
of
it
is
simply
this.
the
bartfields,
as
grantors,
named
petitioner
their
attorney
for
these
purposes,
which
is
written
in
the
hand
of
petitioner,
“for
all
matters
pertaining
to
our
federal
and
california
state
income
taxes
and
tax
returns
for
the
calendar
years
1954
to
1959
inclusive.
this
includes
the
filing
and
signing
of
tax
returns
and
all
of
the
necessary
forms
such
as
extension
of
time,
etcetera,
and
the
filing
of
necessary
refund
claims
and
receiving,
depositing,
endorsing,
which
of
course
appears
above
the
carat,
and
otherwise
negotiating
such
refund
checks
at
his
sole
discretion
including
the
right
of
offset.
furthermore,
to
make
any
compromises
and
settlements
at
his
sole
discretion
as
he
sees
fit
and
proper,
furthermore,
to
perform
any
further
act
as
he
may
deem
necessary
under
the
circumstances.
we
further
agree
to
hold
said
r.
milo
gilbert
harmless
for
any
and
all
acts
committed.”
the
signatures
purport
to
be
daniel
h.
bartfield,
charline
r.
bartfield.
they're
both
asked
as
to
their
signatures.
they
both
thought
that
looked
like
their
respective
signatures.
they
weren't
absolutely
positive
about
it
but
they
thought
it
looked
like
it.
now,
they
didn't
recall
having
signed
that
--
this
paper.
they
didn't
recall
having
constituted
petitioner
as
their
attorney.
the
whole
thing
was
new
to
them.
insofar
as
any
tax
refund
was
concerned,
they
didn't
know
they
had
any
tax
refund
coming
back.
they
never
knew
about
it.
the
only
thing,
apparently,
that
informed
them
of
this
tax
refund
was
when
government
men
came
around
and
showed
them
these
checks
and
asked
them
whether
or
not
those
were
their
signatures
on
the
endorsements.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir?
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
more
correct,
they
did
not.
that
is
correct.
they
positively
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
and
they
did
not
recall
having
signed
this
paper
here.
that's
the
reconciliation
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
correct.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
you
had
it
exactly
right
and
i
had
it
somewhat
jumbled
up.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
they
did
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
they
said
--
i'd
say
they
satisfactorily
identified
them
as
their
signatures,
although
they
were
not
positive
about
it.
they
thought
they
were
their
signatures.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
and
we
--
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
were
forgeries.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
they
--
most
of
the
signers
thought
they
were
their
signatures
but
they
weren't
sure
about.
they
were
rather
mystified
themselves,
if
you
read
their
testimony,
how
they
got
on
there.
now,
another
thing
we
might
observe
about
this
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
talking
about
the
evidence
in
this
case
says
that
the
jury
may
have
believed
that
they
were
forgeries.
nobody
ever
said,
apparently,
that
they
were
forgeries.
the
only
thing
is
that
the
bartfields
thought
they
looked
like
their
signatures.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
they
suggested
several
possibilities.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
both
of
which
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
correct.
they
suggested
that
and
they
suggested,
i
believe
if
i'm
not
mistaken
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
they
--
they
could
be
forgeries.
they
had
two
go-rounds
about
this,
one
on
the
original
hearing
and
one
on
their
motion
for
rehearing.
i
believe,
the
second
time,
they
suggested
that
as
possibility.
the
court
--
the
jury
might
have
believed
they
were
forgeries
since
bartfield
just
said
they
looked
like
their
signatures.
now,
another
thing
we
might
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir?
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
yes.
that's
right.
the
language
of
the
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
was
going
to
come
to
that
soon
because
i'm
sure
that
will
be
a
verdict
too
on
the
final
argument
here
about
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
the
court
of
appeals
language
was
rather
--
was
rather
sketchy
on
that.
they
said
that
it
didn't
appear
--
well,
let
me
see
what
was
their
language?
i
was
going
to
come
to
that.
they
said,
“there
being
no
proof
of
authority
in
writing.”
that's
what
they
said
on
their
original
opinion
and
then
it
was
pointed
out
to
them
that
they
were
inaccurate
in
that
statement,
and
they
amended
it
by
saying,
“there
being
no
adequate
or
convincing
proof
of
authority
in
writing,”
which
as
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment,
were
still
not
completely
accurate.
but,
that's
not
the
real
issue
in
this
case.
let
me
point
out,
before
we
fold
up
the
power
of
attorney
or,
of
course,
the
court
may
wish
to
keep
it
up
there,
but
the
acknowledgment
here
by
the
wife
of
the
petitioner
in
which,
as
i
observed
the
acknowledgment,
it
doesn't
bear
a
notarial
seal
but
bears
everything
else.
they
didn't
know
anything
about
that
acknowledgment.
they
didn't
remember
at
all
that
they'd
ever
told
mrs.
gilbert
or
anybody
else
that
this
was
their
free
act
indeed,
and
mrs.
gilbert
didn't
appear
as
a
witness.
now,
before
we
get
on
to
this
matter
which
your
honor
brought
up,
let
me
mention
what
the
petitioner
said
about
this
whole
thing.
now,
he
testified,
first,
generally
as
to
what
his
practice
was
and
he
said
he
always
required
of
his
clients
that
they
sign
powers
of
attorney.
and
that
when
the
refund
checks
would
come
in,
it
was
his
practice
to
deposit
those
checks
to
his
trustee's
account
and
he
would
keep
them
there.
he
said
he
wouldn't
immediately
notify
the
client.
he'd
keep
them
there
usually
until
about
december
because
the
government
might
want
part
of
that
money
back.
now,
he
wasn't
too
clear,
as
i
read
the
record,
as
to
exactly
what
happened
about
this
particular
power
of
attorney,
though
i
think
his
intent
was
to
say
that
on
april
10,
this
was
all
prepared
in
this
form.
he
read
it
all
over
to
the
bartfields
and
they
signed
it
at
that
time.
it
would
be
difficult
to
hold
him
of
a
forgery
charge
because
his
language
is
indefinite
enough
on
that
point
that
you
would
have
some
difficulty.
but
i
think
that
was
his
intent.
he
is
trying
to
say
that,
that
everything
was
in
order.
they
did
sign
this,
just
as
is.
they
knew
all
of
these.
there
was,
thus,
a
square
conflict
of
testimony
as
to
what
the
real
facts
were,
whether
there
was
really
a
knowing,
conferring
of
the
power
of
attorney
by
the
bartfields
to
the
petition.
the
court
submitted
this
thing
to
the
jury,
first,
as
has
been
stated
by
reading
the
statute
and
then
sets
the
execution
of
the
endorsements
by
petitioner
had
been
admitted.
the
only
really
substantial
question
which
remained
was
the
question
of
authority
and
that
was
submitted
by
the
court's
instruction.
i
think
a
little
sketchily,
if
i
may
say
so.
however,
no
objection
was
made
at
that
time
or
later
so
far
as
that
is
concerned
to
the
form
of
the
instructions,
so
that
is
not
really
in
the
case.
the
real
thing
which
the
jury
had
to
determine
was
did
or
did
not
the
bartfields
confer,
either
orally
or
by
this
writing,
a
power
on
the
petitioner
to
accept
these
checks
and
to
endorse
them
and
place
them
in
his
account,
or
perhaps
they
should
leave
out
that
last,
simply
a
power
to
endorse
them.
that
question,
the
jury
resolved
in
favor
of
the
government.
they
accepted
the
testimony
of
the
bartfields.
they
rejected
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner.
the
court
of
appeals,
reviewing
the
case,
said
it
was
a
clear
question
of
credibility
of
witnesses
which
was
determinable
by
the
jury.
if
the
court
had
stopped
right
there,
its
position
would've
been
absolutely
unassailable.
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
pointed
out,
they
went
on
and
said
more,
as
court
sometimes
make
a
mistake
of
doing.
they
said,
“there
being
no
proof
of
authority
in
writing”
and,
as
i
heretofore
mentioned,
it
was
pointed
out
on
motion
for
rehearing,
there
was
a
proof,
this
power
of
attorney.
and
so
they
interlined,
there
was
no
adequate
or
convincing
proof
of
authority
in
writing,
still
not
quite
filling
the
bill
because
whatever
is
adequate
or
convincing
was
not
for
the
court
of
appeals.
that
was
for
the
jury.
but
reading
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
altogether,
what
it
intended
to
say,
and
which
is
fairly
inferable
from
all
its
language
is
simply
this.
that
there
is
a
fact
question
here,
a
dispute
in
evidence,
and
there
is
no
admitted
writing
which
compelled
the
jury
or
the
court
as
a
matter
of
law
to
say
that
power
had
been
conferred.
there
was,
we
concede,
inaccuracy
in
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals.
that,
however,
does
not
call
for
reversal
of
the
judgment.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
further
went
ahead
on
the
motion
for
rehearing
and
said
another
thing
that
they
didn't
need
to
say,
and
which
i
think
was
inaccurate
and
correctly
called
inaccurate
by
the
petitioner.
they
refer
to
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
fraudulent
returns
which
were
the
basis
of
the
refunds
and
the
checks.
well,
there
was
evidence
to
support
the
fraudulent
nature
of
the
returns
--
returns
in
the
other
counts,
but
there
wasn't
on
this.
in
the
interim
between
argument
and
motion
for
rehearing,
the
court
had
forgotten
just
exactly
what
were
the
facts
and
was
slightly
inaccurate.
it
was
wholly
inaccurate,
but
it
was
unnecessary
to
the
decisions
on
that.
and
again,
we
can
throw
the
language
of
the
court
out
but
we
still
have
its
judgment
on
a
matter
of
disputed
facts
in
which
they
said
it
was
not
their
author
--
it
was
not
their
--
within
the
scope
of
their
authority
to
review
the
factual
finding
of
the
jury
and
of
course,
such
as
this
situation,
before
this
court.
now,
there
are
other
things
which
maybe
mentioned
that
they
also
said
in
that
motion
for
rehearing
judgment,
they
kind
of
turned
over
in
their
own
mind
some
of
the
things
that
might
have
been
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
when
they
accepted
the
bartfields'
version
rather
than
accepting
the
petitioner's
version.
and
petitioner
now
calls
that
speculation,
but
that
is
simply
a
recapitulation
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
factual
considerations
which
the
jury
may
have
well
considered.
it
wasn't
the
finding.
it
was
simply
a
consideration
of
things
which
could
support
the
jury's
finding.
so
as
we
see
the
factual
part
of
this
case
and
the
objections
to
the
court's
statements
can
very
well
be
resolved
by
this
court
in
a
few
words.
this
is
simply
a
question
whether
or
not
the
bartfields
knowingly
conferred
power
of
attorney
to
the
petitioner
to
accept
and
receive
these
checks.
now,
it
doesn't
--
it
isn't
shown
anywhere
definitely
in
the
record
about
what
happened
to
this
money,
except
this
one
thing
which
has
been
mentioned
to
both
of
us
that
it
went
into
this
account.
it
was
there
for
a
period
of
several
months,
we
don't
know
exactly
how
long.
the
bartfields
never
knew
about
it.
the
petitioner
had
it.
the
question
is
simply
whether
or
not
he
forged
their
endorsements.
we
come,
therefore,
the
primary
question
in
this
case
which
is
whether
or
not
the
endorsements
herein
constitute
forgery
especially
within
the
meaning
of
this
particular
statute.
now,
originally,
is
it
whether
or
not
a
question
presented
by
this
case
because
the
petition
filed
in
this
court
said
that
the
endorsement
was
in
this
form
on
both
checks,
“daniel
h.
and
charline
r.
bartfield
by
r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee.”
the
checks
themselves
were
not
before
us,
but
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that
was
the
language
of
the
endorsement.
the
government
brief
below
said
that
was
the
language
of
the
endorsement,
and
the
government
in
its
brief
and
our
position
herein,
saying
that
everybody
agreed
that
was
the
language,
assumed
such
to
be
the
case
and
our
brief
and
our
position
was
framed
on
that
basis.
now,
had
the
endorsement
been
in
that
form
by
r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee,
there
is
a
clear
showing
on
the
face
of
the
endorsement
that
the
foregoing
signatures
were
made
by
r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee.
and,
the
majority
holding
or
the
american
courts
is
at
such
an
endorsement
does
not
constitute
forgery,
as
it
is
generally
understood.
so
there
is
certainly
no
feeling
that
the
court
had
this
devote
in
anyway
when
it
grant
a
certiorari
in
this
case.
it
was
a
case
which
seemed
to
call
for
it,
but
those
don't
seem
to
be
the
facts
at
all.here
is
nothing
further
which
i
think
should
be
explained
to
the
court,
so
as
you
will
understand
the
briefs
that
both
parties
have
filed
in
this
case,
is
this.
that
following
the
grant
of
the
clerk
of
this
court,
by
his
deputy,
wrote
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
requested
that
the
original
to
these
documents
be
set
up,
saying
that
they
were
not
included
within
the
record
which
had
been
set
up
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
back
and
said,
“we
don't
have
them
but
we
have,
however,
inquired
from
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
and
he
has
obtained
photocopies
of
them
from
the
treasury
agent
in
los
angeles.
these
are
forwarded
here
with
and
with
the
--
without
objection
by
either
parties,
we
assume
that
the
photocopies
may
be
accepted
the
same
as
the
originals.”
those
were
set
up.
they
were
printed
in
the
record.
i
should
say,
they
were
copied
in
the
record
at
page
87
and
83
of
the
record,
and
it
was
only
quite
recently
that
it
was
discovered
for
reasons
which
nobody
seems
to
know
exactly
the
answer
that
the
original
of
these
checks
is
and
was
within
the
files
of
the
court
and
that
these
endorsements
are
in
this
form
“daneil
h.
gilbert
--
daniel
h.
bartfield
on
one
line,
charline
r.bartfield
on
the
second
line,
r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee,
on
the
third
line,”
no
“by”
there
at
all
in
both
the
original
brief
and
in
the
reply
brief.
there's
quite
a
bit
of
arguing
back
and
forth
about
whether
we
should
accept
these
photocopies
which
didn't
include
the
word
“by.”
now,
that's
not
in
the
case.
we
have
before
us
a
very
simple
case,
as
we
see
it,
whether
it's
nothing
on
the
face
of
these
endorsements
which,
on
its
face,
shows
that
the
petitioner
signed
for
the
bartfields
at
all.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
stipulation
was
simply
this.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
the
stipulation,
we
all
turn
to
that
just
to
give
it
in
--
mr.
bartfield
is
being
quizzed
by
the
government
counsel.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
page
is
--
i
was
going
to
look
and
see
whether
it
begins
on
this
page
or
the
next.
at
page
41
at
the
bottom,
we'll
start
right
there
to
get
the
--
no,
wait
a
minute.
start
at
the
bottom
of
the
following
page
42.
“mr.
bartfield,
i
show
you
government's
exhibits
31
and
32,
did
you
ever
authorize
mr.
gilbert
to
have
any
tax
refund
checks
made
payable
to
you
and
sent
to
him?”
answer,
“no.”
“i
call
your
attention
to
the
back
of
government's
exhibit
31.
is
that
your
signature
on
the
back
of
that
document?”
“no,
sir.”
mr.
dorn,
defense
counsel,
“the
court
please,
if
it
will
save
time,
i
will
stipulate
that
those
signatures
on
those
checks
are
signed
by
mr.
gilbert
in
mr.
gilbert's
handwriting.
this
witness
did
not
sign
them.”
in
other
words,
he
admitted
that
he
executed
the
signatures.
now,
how
that
takes
out
of
the
case
any
criminal
element,
i
fail
to
understand.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes?
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
we
not
--
not
only
concede
that,
we
allege
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
correct.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
--
that
is
entirely
correct,
mr.
stewart
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
yes,
sir.
now,
the
--
it
seems
to
me
though
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no.
i
--
my
answer
is
no
on
that.
here's
what
happened.
the
original
of
these
checks
was
before
--
were
before
the
jury
and
the
court.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
they
were
handed
to
the
witnesses.
presumably,
the
jury
as
well
saw
them.
there
is
no
“by”
on
those
checks
there.
the
only
thing
that
i
found
that
would
justify
that
assertion
on
the
part
of
petitioner's
counsel
is
that
prior
to
the
charge
to
the
jury,
there
was
a
colloquy
in
which
judge
yankwich
said
this.
i'm
trying
to
find
his
exact
language.
yes,
i
believe
it's
at
record
63.
no,
no,
pardon
me.
that's
not
it.
yes,
it
is
at
63
but
has
in
another
point.
“an
endorsement,”
this
is
judge
yankwich,
"is
fictitious
when
the
man
puts
the
name
of
somebody
else
by
himself
as
trustee
when
he
is
not
trustee.”
he
is
arguing
back
and
forth
with
the
counsel
at
that
time.
now,
the
basis
for
what
judge
yankwich
said
there
was
simply
this,
that
there
were
other
counts.
and
in
these
are
the
counts,
and
your
honors,
in
reviewing
the
exhibits
in
this
case,
we'll
see
that
this
is
true,
the
other
counts,
they
did
have
checks
which
were
signed
“payees”
followed
by
the
word
“by
r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee.”
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
different
payees.
yes,
sir.
that
was
it.
that
was
it
exactly.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir?
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir?
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
a
matter
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
a
matter
of
words
there,
a
matter
of
words
there,
sir.
i
should
perhaps
be
more
exact
to
say
it's
stipulated
they
were
in
the
hand,
you
could
put
it
that
way
to
explain
the
difference
in
meaning.
we
concede
or
we
all
agree
that
gilbert
--
gilbert
was
the
one
who
put
these
all
there,
but
we
don't
say
that
they're
all
in
substantially
the
same
kind
of
handwriting.
and
let's
us
just,
while
we're
on
that
point,
take
a
look
at
those
endorsements.
now,
first,
i'll
give
you
the
one
which,
to
some
extent,
supports
the
petitioner's
view.
that
is
the
one
that
in
support
of
count
20,
40
--
22,
and
it's
found
on
page
83
of
the
record.
this
is
not
too
clear.
your
originals
will
show
up
more
clearly.
but
i
think
you
can
quite
--
well,
get
the
idea
from
the
examination
of
these
copies.
now,
it
might
be
said,
as
mr.
okrand
has
suggested
to
the
court,
that
might
be
the
conclusion
of
some
people.
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
the
conclusion
of
all,
that
all
three
signatures
there
are
executed
on
their
face
by
one
man
in
one
handwriting.
now,
if
we're
through
with
that
one,
take
a
look
at
page
87,
the
one
supporting
count
21.
the
first
one
is
obliterated
forcedly
by
the
stand.
but
you
have,
first,
“daniel
h.
bartfield”
in
a
small
crimped
signature,
following
is
a
more
flowing
signature
“charline
r.
bartfield,”
then
you'd
find
in
an
oblique
and
large
free-flowing
handwriting,
the
signature
of
“r.
milo
gilbert,
trustee.”
now,
i
say
the
most
casual
glance
at
that
would
make
you
certainly
think
that
those
were
three
different
people
who
have
signed
that.
but
we
say
this.
it's
not
up
to
this
court
to
act
as
judge
into
that
matter.
it's
not
even
up
to
the
bank
clerks
to
be
sufficiently
expert
in
handwriting
to
say
that
on
the
face
of
it,
whether
or
not
those
were
executed
by
one
man.
but
we
say
is
simply
this.
that
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
these
endorsements
which
shows
that
one
man
executed
all
of
them
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
an
attempt
is
made
to
build
an
argument
on
the
fact
that
the
phase
which
has
reversed
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir,
before
we
leave
that?
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
because
there
is
intent
here
for
--
we
contend,
on
the
jury
is
so
final
that
gilbert
character
--
gilbert
simply
was
signing
all
these
three
signatures
on
there
and
putting
it
on
there
in
such
a
manner
that
the
bank
clerk
would
take
the
check
and
deposit
to
his
account.
and
thereafter,
he
was
free
to
do
anything
he'd
like
with
them
and
never
did
anything,
incidentally,
to
dispose
of
them
to
see
that
the
bartfields
got
any
part
of
it.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
he
executed
them
alright,
but
if
there
is
any
question
for
this
court
to
determine
about
whether
he
simulated
the
writing
of
another
person,
we
think
this
one
on
87
rather
clearly
indicates
that
he
was
trying
to
indicate
the
bartfields
had
signed.
those
are
very
genuine
signatures.
now,
this
is
it
because
he's
the
last
signer.
it's
all
that
it
is.
but
we
don't
think
actually,
your
honors,
that
you
have
to
determine
because
we
don't
think
you
have
to
act
as
judges
of
a
factual
question.
we
say
simply
that
on
the
face
of
this
endorsement,
there
is
nothing
which
shows
that
petitioner
signed
with
an
agency
relationship
there
so
as
to
give
notice
to
that
--
everybody
concerned
that
he
was
signing
with
authority
because
there
are,
as
i
say,
majority
cases
hold
that
signature
where
it
shows
on
its
face
that
the
bottom
signature
is
signing
the
others
and
it
representing
his
authority
to
do
so
on
its
face,
then
that's
not
forgery.
now,
we
come
to
how
that
crept
into
our
law
in
a
moment
and
see
why
it's
applicable
in
this
particular
statute.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
is
that
correct,
sir?
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i'll
help
you
clear
that
out.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
there
is,
yes,
sir.
there
are
and
we've
cited
that.
now,
we
--
the
contrary
authority
are
cases.
i'll
simply
cite
them
to
the
court
at
this
time.
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
where
they
appear.
they
--
if
i
can
find
that
page.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
there
are
--
there
are
authorities
but,
as
i
say,
the
weight
of
authority
is
his
in
favor.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
and
some
federal
cases,
some
state
cases
had
held
that
even
though
the
thing
shows
on
its
face
an
authority,
that
may
be
--
may
also
be
forgery.
incidentally,
while
we're
on
this
point
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well
now,
i've
never
found
any
case
for
exactly
this
situation
that's
presented
where
the
--
it's
ever
been
even
contended
that
you
can
get
by
without
the
word
“by”
or
something
similar,
and
you
can't
have
this
kind
of
a
situation.
you
can
have
a
per
b
or
something
like
that,
or
a
per
procuration
b
something
of
that
character,
or
you
can
have
this.
you
can
have
the
name
of
the
corporation
written
or
stamped
or
typewritten
followed
by
the
signature.
that
on
its
face,
shows
that
the
signer
at
the
last
is
signing
the
others.
that's
not
forgery
according
to
this
majority
view.
now
originally,
they
complained
everything
hinged
on
this
word
“by.”
since
the
word
“by”
is
out,
now
they're
shifting
around
on
the
use
of
word
to
somewhat
different
contentions
and
it's
contended
for
one
thing
that
the
face
of
the
check
there,
when
it
says
“daniel
h.
and
charlene
r.
bartfield
c/o
r.
milo
gilbert,”
followed
by
endorsements
on
the
other
side
shows,
looking
at
both
of
them
together,
that
gilbert
signed
for
all
three.not
at
all,
not
at
all
as
we
see
it.
all
that
happens
there
is
that
you
have
checks
made
to
the
barkfields
as
the
principal
payees
in
care
of
the
petitioner
who
had
also
have
to
sign,
but
he
hasn't
signed
“by”
or
he
hasn't
signed
“care
of”
or
anything
to
show
agents.
he
just
signed
“trustee”
and,
now,
they
claim
that
“trustee”
is
the
key
word
that
shows
that
they
were
signing
the
previous
signatures.
our
answer
to
that
is
not
at
all
also,
because
when
you
add
the
word
“trustee”
to
a
signature,
it
may
very
well
and
probably
have
been
that
it
was
simply
put
there
to
show
which
account
this
check
and
these
checks
were
to
be
--
to
be
deposited
to,
and
that
is
not
simply
our
position.
that
is
the
position
which
the
petitioner
has
taken.
in
his
petition
herein,
he
said
at
page
10
at
footnote
7
that
the
reason
was
undoubtedly
so
as
to
facilitate
the
bank
clerks
in
determining
into
which
account
to
deposit
the
check.
in
the
trial,
the
same
theory
was
advocated
by
defense
counsel
where
they
were
arguing
for
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
that's
at
page
63
and
mr.
dorn
said
there,
“i
think
it's
the
general
practice
to
put
down
in
endorsing
a
check,
the
name
of
the
account
to
which
the
check
is
to
be
deposited.”
the
court
says,
“that's
right.”
now,
that
was
their
theory
before.
that's
the
reason
“trustee”
is
on
there.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
simply
to
show
the
account.
yes,
sir?
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
bartfield.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
suppose,
my
answer
to
the
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i'd
say
that
you're
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
you're
right
on
this,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
prior
endorsement,
as
the
bartfields
being
in
blank
just
made
them
as
cash
and,
thereafter
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
--
on
face
of
it,
it
was
all
gilbert's.
he
could
put
it
anywhere
he
wanted.
he
wants
it
in
his
trustee's
account.
they
have
a
trustee's
account.
they
put
it
in
that
account
and
there
it
goes.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
right.
that's
currently
what
would
be
the
result.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well
now,
the
jury
there,
as
i
say,
the
instructions
are
somewhat
sketchy,
what
was
submitted
to
them
was
simply
whether
they
had
authority,
whether
petitioner
has
the
authority
to
make
this
endorsement.
if
he
didn't,
then
when
he
wrote
the
names
of
the
bartfields,
that
was
--
that
was
a
forgery,
that
seems
to
have
been
what
the
court
submitted.
and
as
i
say,
if
there
had
been
question
about
the
form
of
the
instructions
at
the
time,
then
the
court
probably
would
have
made
it
more
specific.
it's
pretty
--
a
pretty
sloppy
way
to
submit
the
case,
but
that's
not
really
in
the
case
as
we
see
it
now
because
no
issue
has
been
made
on
appeal
or
in
the
trial
court
as
to
the
form
of
instructions.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
we
say
they
don't
have
to
reach
that
third
question,
which
i
was
going
to
go
on
to
discuss
in
a
moment,
whether
495
is
broader
than
the
majority
view
holds
forgery
to
be.
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
--
that
question,
on
our
view
of
the
facts.
we
think
that,
actually,
the
court
say
that
in
view
of
the
error
here
about
the
--
what
the
form
the
endorsement
was,
the
court
could
say
this
simply
improvidently
granted,
the
improvidence
of
course
not
being
on
the
core
of
the
court
and
not
part
of
the
--
everybody
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
excuse
me,
sir.
i
didn't
mean
to
address
myself
entirely
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
we're
saying
that,
actually,
we
think
that
in
view
of
all
the
facts
as
they
had
been
revealed
by
the
full
record,
the
court
could
say
that
the
writ
was
improvidently
granted.
the
improvidence
not
being
on
the
core
the
court
but
simply
because
the
court
thought,
and
we
all
thought
before
this
matter
is
fully
revealed,
that
the
signatures
were
in
a
du
--
different
form
“by
r.
mile
gilbert,
trustee”
which
does
raise
a
non-illegal
question.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
correct,
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
what
was
the
colloquy
there
between
judge
yankwich
and
the
attorneys,
i
don't
subscribe
to
all
that
judge
yankwich
says,
but
he
points
out
that
this
statute
is
broader
than
the
usual
concept
of
forgery.
usually,
it
might
be
said
and
certainly
the
narrower
view
of
forgery
is
that
it's
merely
a
counterfeiting
of
the
signature
of
another.
if
you
take
that
narrower
view,
of
course,
this
would
not
be
forgery.
he
says
the
statute
is
broader
than
that
narrower
view
and
i
was
going
to
go
on
and
rather
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
as
i
see
it,
of
course
it
has
to
be
tried
on
these
other
counts,
assuming
the
government
wants
to.
ut
on
this
other,
we
say
that
it
was
--
that
the
only
real
question
which
a
jury
should
have
to
pass
on
is
simply
whether
or
not
authority
was
right
to
endorse.
if
no
authority
was
granted,
oral
or
written,
then
the
verdict
and
judgment
was
correct.
and
so,
we
say
there's
no
necessity
at
all
to
remand.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
believe
so.
i
didn't
follow
you
altogether,
but
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
it's
forgery
under
any
possible
concept,
common
law,
statutory,
or
any
other
concept.
we
say
if
the
word
“by”
is
out
there,
because
there's
nothing
on
the
face
of
this
endorsement
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
to
give
notice
to
the
casher
of
the
check
that
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
correct.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
correct.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir,
which
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
--
was
resolved
by
the
jury.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
what
i
was
going
to
come
to,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
now,
i
address
myself
to
that
question
at
this
time.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
now,
if
the
word
“by”
were
in
there
or
if
there
were
anything
which
we
are
unable
to
discern
which,
on
its
face,
shows
that
petitioner
was
endorsing,
citing
the
names
of
these
other
people
here,
under
the
majority
view
of
the
american
authorities,
at
the
present
time,
that
would
not
constitute
a
forgery.
that
would
constitute
merely
a
misrepresentation
of
authority
by
petitioner.
let
us
view,
for
a
moment,
how
that
crept
into
our
law
because,
as
we
will
tempt
to
show,
it
wasn't
originally
the
common
law
understanding.
the
first
case
which
took
such
a
view
was
decided
in
great
britain
in
1847,
queen
against
white.
the
facts
in
that
case
were
simply
this.
white,
a
former
employee
of
one
thomas
thomassen,
went
into
the
bank
with
a
bill
of
exchange
payable
to
thomassen
which
he
wish
to
present
and
get
the
money
for.
they
thought
he,
of
course,
was
still
an
employee.
the
clerk
wrote
on
the
face
of
the
bill
of
exchange
“per
procuration,
thomas
thomassen”
and
then
said
to
white,
“sign.”
he
signed.
the
jury,
observing
the
legal
question,
the
jury
found
that
he
was
guilty
and
the
legal
question
was
resolved
by
15
judges
of
the
court
--
king's
bench
court.
actually,
the
court
didn't
say
anything
to
justify
what
its
finding
was.
it
said
this
is
the
case
of
first
impression.
as
far
as
we're
able
to
find,
it
was.
there's
no
previous
case
that
we
have
located
of
which
has
been
cited
deciding
that
question.
but
it
just
said,
without
opinion,
that
this
is
not
forgery.
apparently,
i
would
say
that
the
reasoning
perhaps
was
that
of
the
petitioner's
counter
--
the
petitioner's
counsel
in
that
case,
which
was
that
the
bank
clerk
had
relied
not
on
the
signature
but
he'd
signed
on
the
--
he
relied
upon
the
signer.
why
did
he
sign
that
right
in
his
presence
there
and
reliance
was
placed
on
that
rather
than
on
the
representation
of
authority?
well,
that
was
the
law
established
in
1847
in
england.
how
did
it
get
over
here?
well,
in
1856
or
1857,
a
massachusetts
case
decided
this,
that's
the
baldwin
case
and
in
1861,
this
took
place.
parliament,
which
apparently
had
seen
the
mischievous
effects
of
this
kind
of
interpretation
of
forgery
on
the
business
community,
changed
the
law
and,
by
statute,
defined
forgery
so
that
it
included
anything
which
is
a
misrepresentation
of
authority.
now,
that's
1861.
in
1866,
there's
a
new
york
case
which
without
--
in
which
white
was
cited,
but
the
court
didn't
cite
anything.
it
just
decided
it
wasn't
forgery.
but,
how
regina
against
white
really
got
into
our
law,
as
i
see
it,
was
through
the
case
of
henry
tully,
decided
by
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
1884.
and
in
that
case,
which
was
in
extradition
case
of
an
englishman
who
had,
with
authority
in
that
case,
signed
certain
checks
on
his
bank.
he
was
employee
of
an
english
bank
there
and
he'd
signed
certain
checks
and
--
which
he
was
authorized
to
do,
and
then
he'd
claim
to
turnover
the
money
to
other
agents
of
the
bank
but
instead,
he
had
taken
the
money
and
fled
to
america,
$200,000
worthy.
when
he
got
over
here,
they
attempted
to
extradite
him
under
a
forgery
statute,
under
forgery
treaty
i
should
say.
and,
the
circuit
court
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
held
that
this
wasn't
forgery
because,
first,
and
this
was
its
holding,
because
tully
had
authority
to
withdraw
--
to
sign
those
checks
for
the
bank.
they
said,
“even
without
authority,
under
regina
against
white,
he
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
forgery
and
so,
were
not
going
to
send
him
back.”
now,
it
got
in,
as
you
see
there,
as
a
dictum,
not
knowing
that
england
itself
had
already
disavowed
regina
against
white
by
changing
in
its
statutory
form
the
definition
of
forgery.
well,
tully
and
white
had
been
the
progenitors
of
all
the
american
cases.
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find,
i
think
that's
great.
they
all
trace
back
to
an
english
case,
the
parent
country
of
which
had
disavowed
it.
in
which,
regarding
to
this
country,
largely
by
way
of
dictum,
it
is,
as
i
have
said,
been
largely
adapted
by
the
state
courts
and
by
--
and,
usually,
by
the
federal
courts,
although
there
had
been
dissenters
on
that,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief.
now,
should
we
apply
that
to
this
case
or
to
this
statute?
this
statute,
it
looks
bright
and
spanking
new
in
its
us
code
form,
but
it's
really
an
1823
statute
which
has
come
down
to
us
without
substantial
change.
so
really,
if
you
are
getting
right
to
the
beat
of
the
thing,
you
want
to
look
back
at
this
as
a
statute
enacted
50
years
before
--
or
25
years
before
white
and
50
years
before
tully.
and,
what
did
congress
mean
at
that
time?
well,
in
the
first
place,
they
entitled
the
act,
an
act
to
punish
--
let
me
get
it
exactly.
well,
i
believe
this
is
it.
i
don't
find
it.
an
act
to
punish
frauds
committed
against
the
government
of
the
united
states.
that
is
it,
exactly.
in
other
words,
at
least
in
the
title
of
the
act,
they
were
primarily
interested
in
preventing
fraud
and
that
is,
historically,
the
purpose
of
forgery
statutes.
and
what
was
the
meaning
of
forgery
at
that
time?
at
that
time,
there
were
no
american
cases
that
i
have
found
which
give
any
very
adequate
definition
that's
clarifying
on
this
particular
point.
but
let's
look
at
what
some
of
the
english
authorities
said.
if
i
may
read,
blackstone
said
that
forgery
is
the
fraudulent
making
or
alteration
of
a
writing
to
the
prejudice
of
another
man's
right.
that's
broad
enough
certainly
to
cover
it.
coke
said
that
forgery
is
property
taken
when
the
act
is
done
in
the
name
of
another
person.
well,
this
was
taken
in
the
name
of
another
person.
in
getting
more
directly
to
the
question
here,
whether
unauthorized
signatures
may
constitute
forgery,
let's
take
a
look
at
some
other
language
which
was
initially
--
initially
pronounced
by
sergeant
hawkins.
he
said,
“also,
the
notion
of
forgery
does
not
seem
so
much
to
consist
in
the
counterfeiting
of
a
man's
hand
and
seal,
which
may
often
be
done
innocently.”
you
see,
that's
what
we
are
talking
--
what
the
petitioner
is
talking
about
now,
it's
counterfeiting.
he
says
it
doesn't
consist
so
much
in
that
which
may
often
be
done
innocently,
but
in
endeavoring
to
give
an
appearance
of
truth
to
a
mere
deceit
and
falsity
and
either
to
impose
that
upon
the
world
as
a
solemn
act
of
another
which
he
is
in
no
way
privy
to,
and
that's
what
the
jury
found
here.
that
petitioner
was
not
privy
to
the
bartfields,
or
at
least
to
make
a
man's
own
act
hereto
have
been
done
at
a
time
when
it
was
not
done,
and
by
force
of
such
falsity
to
give
it
an
operation
which
in
truth
and
justice,
it
ought
not
to
have.
well,
now,
under
hawkins'
definition,
this
would
be
forgery,
i
say,
and
that
language
was
copied
by
baker,
almost
verbatim.
and
east
who
wrote
in
1803,
and
it
is
said
to
have
written
most
extensive
of
any
author
at
that
time
prior
to
1823
on
the
subject
of
forgery,
has
about
200
pages
on
the
subject
in
his
work.
he
says
this.
he
quotes
also
the
language
of
hawkins
and
baker,
and
he
adds
this,
“it's
a
making
(inaudible)
of
any
written
instrument
for
the
purpose
of
fraud
and
deceit,
and
wrestle
on
the
prize
which
is
a
very
old
text.
the
first
edition
came
out
four
years
before
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1819
and
the
recent
edition,
11th
edition,
came
out
1958
and
they
mentioned
--
the
author
there
mentions
the
generality
with
which
forgery
was
understood
in
the
early
18th
century.
so,
we
say
that,
actually,
if
you
get
right
down
to
the
legal
question,
which
we
initially
thought
was
presented
by
this
case
in
our
brief,
in
our
position,
whether
where
on
the
face
of
the
endorsement,
there
was
a
showing
that
the
previous
endorsements
were
by
another
person
as
agent,
we
say
that
even
if
that
situation
on
the
facts
are
presented,
looking
at
the
particular
statute
here,
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
how
this
later
concept
crept
into
the
law,
that
we
shouldn't
apply
that
rather
narrow
definition
of
forgery
to
this
case
because
there
is
a
fraud
on
the
government.
the
fraud
on
the
government
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
there
are
other
statutes
and
we
say,
actually,
if
the
court
were
rewriting
all
the
law,
forgery
--
the
forge
--
the
proper
understanding
of
forgery
is
really
the
common
law
understanding
of
it
and
that
which,
as
--
begin
with
regina
against
white,
is
in
its
presence
which
could
be
disregarded.
however,
as
this
particular
statute,
it
is
especially
clear
because
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1823
before
regina
against
white
ever
came
up,
and
that
theory
was
ever
advocated.
however,
our
basic
position,
as
we've
endeavored
to
point
out
to
the
court,
is
that
you
do
not
have
to
reach
that
it's
whether
not
a
legal
question
because
on
the
facts,
as
the
full
record
here
reveals,
there
is
nothing,
which
on
the
face
of
it,
shows
that
petitioner
signed
the
bartfields'
names.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
think
they
would,
if
they
had
raised
that
point
and
i
think
the
court
should
have
very
well
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
even
a
jury
would
be
authorized
to
pass
on
that
factual
question,
certainly
not
in
this
court.
i
have
perhaps
indicated
that
the
jury
should,
but
i
question
even
whether
the
jury
should.
i
say
that
the
jury
would
--
would
have
to
decide,
first,
the
question
of
authority
and
if
they
didn't
find
there
is
any
authority
to
execute
the
bartfields'
endorsements,
then
the
petitioner
was
guilty.
of
course,
if
there
is
anything
which,
on
its
face,
showed
as
a
matter
of
law
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
i
--
no,
as
a
matter
of
the
questions
instruction.
now,
if
it
had
been
admitted,
of
course,
that
this
power
of
attorney
was
executed,
then
there
would've
been
the
matter
of
law
for
the
court
to
instruct
the
jury
on
it.
but
absent
anything
of
that
character,
i
don't
see
what
the
jury
would
really
have
to
determine
in
this
case,
except
the
question
of
authority.
i
don't
think
they
would
look
at
this
and
say,
well,
bar
--
gilbert
didn't
have
authority
but
still,
he's
been
open
enough
that
when
he
went
to
sign,
he's
written
just
his
hand
that
he
ordinarily
writes
it.
i
don't
think
that
would
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no.
i
think
if
--
if
there's
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
document
which
shows
authority
that
he
was
signing
for
these
others
by
per
procuration,
or
anything
like
that,
then
the
only
way
they
can
get
around
the
forgery,
by
common
law
or
by
statute,
is
simply
by
showing
that
he
did
have
authority
to
sign
their
names.
now,
it
doesn't
help
--
it
doesn't
help
these
poor
taxpayers
one
with,
that
they
had
some
money
coming
to
them
which
this
man
got
simply
because,
on
one
of
these
checks
perhaps,
he
didn't
disguise
his
handwriting.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
would
still
be
forgery.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
can't
answer
that
because
it's
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
can't
answer
how
it
was
argued
because
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
see.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
apparently
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
--
he
thought
it
was
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
that's
the
trial
court.
i
think
that
said
something
to
that
effect.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
trial
court
says
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
and
now,
as
i
say,
the
trial
court
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
in
some
of
its
colloquy,
i
do
not
think
it's
entirely
accurate,
so
far
as
i
could
determine.
however,
remember
this,
if
i
may
suggest
this,
the
actual
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
as
is
i
see
it,
your
honor,
we
--
in
the
first
place,
we
indicated
we
don't
subscribe
to
everything
which
the
trial
judge
said
as
to
what
the
law
in
this
case
is.
when
he
quotes
the
supreme
court
there,
i
think
he's
inaccurate
because
i
don't
find
such
an
opinion
in
the
books.
i
do
think
this,
while
he
didn't
consider
that
as
critical,
some
of
these
counts
containing
the
word
“by,”
these
two
counts
not
including
it.
i
think
that
regardless
of
that,
the
actual
facts
in
this
case
and
the
actual
checks
which
were
before
the
jury
showed
that
there
wasn't
any
“by”
there,
so
there's
nothing
which
is
a
matter
of
law
which
took
this
question
away
from
the
jury,
and
the
jury
was
left
with
its
only
real
factual
issue
to
determine
which
was
a
question
of
authority.
that
was
to
be
determined.
did
they
believe
the
bartfields
or
did
they
believe
the
petitioner?
they
believed
the
bartfields.
and
let
me
point
this
out
further,
that
when
we
talk
about
affirming
the
court
of
appeals,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
the
government
apparently
and
did,
incur
in
this
mistake
before
that
court.
because
the
actual
facts,
which
revealed,
show
that
his
word
“by”
wasn't
in
there
and
so,
this
court
can
and
should
affirm
any
judgment
which
appears
upon
actual
facts
as
they
are
shown
by
the
record,
whether
by
any
assumed
facts
would
be
an
entirely
artificial
situation
to
determine
this
case
on
the
basis
of
facts
which
were
not
true
and
which
don't
form
the
basis
which
the
court
--
which
the
jury
determine
this
case
on,
which
was
the
actual
checks
themselves.
now,
as
i
say,
what
the
--
was
said
by
counts
and
argument,
i'm
unable
to
determine
because
that's
not
in
the
record.
