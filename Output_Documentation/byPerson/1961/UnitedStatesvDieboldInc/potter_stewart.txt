justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
first
point
is,
the
court
should
have
been
the
summary
judgment
in
your
favor,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
your
first
point.
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
that
just
one
point?
justice
potter
stewart
but
are
you
asking
us
here
to
render
a
summary
judgment
in
your
favor?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
all
you're
asking
for?
justice
potter
stewart
these
are
all
this
--
this
data
that
you're
giving
us
is
for
the
company's
books,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
basic
claim
of
the
respondents
that
these
books
were
only
that
they
didn't
show
the
correct
picture?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course
that
court
found
otherwise,
as
a
matter
of
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
did
find
that
the
books
did
not
give
a
--
that
the
books
gave
a
false
picture
of
the
correct
picture
of
the
actual
situation.
justice
potter
stewart
or
maybe
full
supply
is
the
word
but
full
is
certainly
would
be.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but
mr.
mcgovern
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
say
didn't
know
the
actual
condition
of
the
company
at
the
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
contracted
by
--
justice
potter
stewart
when
did
you
sign
the
--
were
you
ever
obligated
to
buy
before
the
closing
day?
justice
potter
stewart
he
just
didn't
give
you
an
option.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
a
period
of
time
that's
been
exercising,
between
the
time
you
were
bound
and
time
you
closed?
justice
potter
stewart
you
didn't
arrange
for
a
--
for
audits
prior
to
closing.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
didn't
know
the
addition
of
company
prior
to
closing
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
thought,
it
was
a
--
you
thought
it
was
a
company
in
reasonably
good
shape?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
realize
at
the
time
of
closing
and
it
was
in
a
--
that
it
was
insolvent
in
the
sense
that
you
speak
out?
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
he's
unable
to
pay
his
debts?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
thought
there
was
a
lot
better
shape
in
--
then
it
really
was?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
as
a
matter
fact,
this
company
was
insolvent
in
the
bankruptcies
that
his
assets
exceeded
his
--
or
his
liability
exceeded
in
his
assets?
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
meant
by
tangible
net
worth
in
those
findings,
could
tell
us?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mcgovern,
isn't
this
the
normal
situation
for
someone
to
seek
chapter
10
rather
than
straight
bankruptcy?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
friedman
your
basic
deposition
here
is
that
there
was
error
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
to
grant
a
summary
judgment
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
ask
you
--
let
me
say
it
that
we
seem
to
have
here
a
record
of
some
638
pages.
now,
i
ask
you
what
additional
evidence
the
government
would
have
or
could
have
adduced
for
their
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
so
why
make
any
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
motivation
make
any
difference?
