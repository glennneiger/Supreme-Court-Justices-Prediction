chief

warren
because,
what
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
except
this
current
cash
situation
of
the
company
and
the
slightly
decreasing
sales
last
year
or
so
that
would
tend
show
its
failing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
--
you
don't
have
to
make
that
case.
i've
just
asked
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you
see
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
--
okay.

when
was
that
audit
have
made
before
or
after
the
--
before
or
after
the
transaction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
that
audit
made
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before
or
after
the
transaction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
these
facts
that
you're
talking
about
now
known
to
diebold
at
the
time
they
purchased?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
mcgovern,
i'm
just
wondering
if
so
far
as
the
status
of
the
company
is
concerned
that
there'd
be
any
great
difference
between
this
little
black
box
situation
and
just
as
delaying
granting
checks
for
two
or
three
months?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
be
always
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
see
that.
well,
i
was
just
--
i
was
just
wondering
if
every
company
that
is
late
three
or
four
months
late
in
paying
his
bills
is
failing
company
in
the
sense
that
the
internationally
shoe
company
contemplated
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
times
of
depression,
in
times
of
depression
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
particularly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman
suggested
that
as
a
possibility,
he
may
have
had
financial
credit
that
would
have
unable
him
to
carry
over
but
then
he
did
this
in
order
to
keep
his
company
without
any
long
time
indebtedness,
is
there
any
--
what
is
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
response
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
finding
that
of
the
court
on
that
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcgovern,
would
you
mind
stating
your
opinion
as
to
--
as
of
what
date
we
should
judge
the
failing
condition
of
the
company?
