mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
hereon
appealed
to
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio
is
a
government
civil
antitrust
case
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
compliant
charged
of
the
acquisition
of
the
appellee
diebold
of
all
of
the
assets
have
a
firm
called
the
herring-hall-marvin
safe
company
was
in
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
because
the
effect
to
the
acquisition
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition
or
to
tend
toward
a
monopoly
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
and
selling
bank
vault
equipment
and
related
products.
the
question
on
this
appeal
is
the
propriety
of
the
action
of
the
district
court
in
granting
the
appellee's
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
dismissing
this
complaint
without
a
trial
on
the
merits
on
the
ground
that
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
company
by
diebold,
the
acquired
company
herring-hall-marvin
was
a
failing
company.
and
hence
that
under
the
doctrine
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
international
shoe
case
in
280
united
states
such
an
acquisition
in
not
subject
to
the
probations
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
just
by
way
of
brief
introduction,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
international
shoe
case
enunciated
the
doctrine
which
we
have
set
forth
at
page
21
of
our
brief.
that
were
a
corporation
is
in
failing
circumstances
with
resources
so
depleted
and
the
prospect
of
rehabilitation
so
remote
that
it
face
to
the
grave
probability
of
a
business
failure
with
the
resulting
loss
to
its
stockholders
and
injury
to
the
communities
were
its
plants
were
operated,
the
purchase
of
its
capital
stock
by
a
competitor
there
being
no
other
perspective
purchaser.
now,
with
the
purpose
to
lessen
competition
but
to
facilitate
the
accumulated
business
of
the
purchaser
and
with
the
effect
of
mitigating
its
seriously
injurious
consequences
otherwise
probable
is
not
in
contemplation
of
law
prejudicial
to
the
public
and
does
not
substantially
lessen
competition
or
restrain
commerce
within
the
intent
of
the
clayton
act.
i
think
it's
important
at
the
outset
to
emphasize
just
what
this
failing
company
exception
is.
it's
put
in
terms
of
the
failing
company
defense
to
a
section
7
case.
but
what
it
amounts
to
basically
is
this,
that
there
maybe
circumstances
where
because
of
the
condition
of
the
company,
it's
acquisition
by
a
competitor
maybe
lawful
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
without
regard
to
its
effect
upon
competition.
the
theory
as
we
understand
it
is,
that
if
the
company
is
failing
in
the
sense
that
without
the
acquisition
of
what
have
gone
out
of
business,
it
would
have
ceased
to
be
a
competitive
factor
anyhow.
and
therefore,
the
theory
seems
to
be
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
acquisition
by
a
competitor
will
not
have
be
condemn
adverse
effect
on
competition.
our
position
on
this
appeal
is
that
the
facts
before
the
district
court
affirmatively
showed
that
this
was
not
a
failing
company
contrary
to
the
district
court's
conclusion
and
that
in
any
event,
sufficient
factual
issues
were
raised
to
preclude
the
grant
of
summary
judgment
against
the
government
holding
that
the
failing
company
defense
had
been
established.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
that's
correct.
whereas
--
were
say
--
we
say
first
that
on
this
record,
the
district
court
should
have
held
that
the
failing
company
defense
was
not
applicable.
but
in
any
event,
we
don't
believe
that
on
this
record,
the
court
could've
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
appellee.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
not
summary
--
no
there
was
only
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
appellee.
we
have
had
no
trial
on
the
merits
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
--
that
on
the
showing
made,
the
district
court
should
have
rejected
the
failing
company
defense
and
going
to
a
trial
of
the
merits
of
this
case.
that
is
to
determine
the
effect
on
constitution.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
put
it
--
we
put
it
in
two
steps,
we
think
that
this
record
affirmatively
we
showed
there
was
no
failing
company
defense.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
no.
we're
asking
for
reversal
of
the
judgment
dismissing
this
compliant
and
sending
it
back
for
a
trial.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
we
hope
--
we
hope
that
this
court
will
agree
with
us
that
the
summary
--
that
the
failing
company
defense
was
not
established
on
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
what
we
hope.
but
in
the
event,
the
court
is
not
prepared
to
go
that
far.
we
think
certainly,
they
should
have
been
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
mr.
justice.
now,
the
company
that
was
acquired
the
herring-hall-marvin
company
--
safe
company
was
basically
a
one
man
operation
under
the
control
of
its
president
mr.
mosman,
who
had
88%
of
the
outstanding
stock.
beginning
around
1957,
mr.
mosman
made
several
attempts
to
dispose
of
a
company.
and
finally
in
may
of
1959,
mr.
mosman
entered
into
an
oral
agreement
with
the
diebold
company,
the
appellee,
to
sell
the
assets
of
herring-hall-marvin
to
diebold.
the
transaction
took
the
form
of
an
option
to
purchase,
to
which
there
was
attached
a
proposed
contract
purchase
and
sale.
the
option
agreement
was
signed
on
june
16th.
and
approximately
one
month
later,
the
17th
of
july,
the
contract
was
signed.
the
purchase
price
was
$3,000,000
in
cash
plus
the
assumption
by
diebold
of
all
the
liabilities
of
herring-hall-marvin
to
the
date
of
the
closing
in
this
case.
the
balance
sheet
was
submitted
as
of
the
30th
of
april,
and
diebold
undertook
to
paying
not
only
all
the
liabilities
shown
on
the
balance
sheet
but
all
liabilities
that
might
develop
between
then
and
the
closing.
the
government
filed
its
complaint
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
transaction.
a
motion
--
an
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction
was
denied.
and
on
september
11th
1959,
this
transaction
was
consummated.
there
were
various
pre-trail
proceedings
and
14
months
later,
the
contention
was
raised
for
the
first
time,
that
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
this
company
was
a
failing
company.
and
finally
on
january
19th,
1961
approximately
18,
17,
or
18
month
prior
to
the
acquisition,
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
based
on
the
failing
company
defense
was
filed.
the
motion
had
attached
to
a
number
of
papers.
there
was
an
affidavit
--
affidavits
of
the
president
and
vice-president
of
the
acquiring
company
diebold
and
there
was
a
special
audit
report
prepared
by
lybrand
brothers
ross
and
montgomery
the
regular
auditors
of
the
company.
basically,
the
primary
contention
of
diebold
was
it
is
this
company
was
a
failing
company
because
of
its
cash
shortages
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
and
for
period
of
approximately
eight
months
before
that.
now,
you
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
sir?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
of
the
shortages
of
cash
the
company
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
had
difficulty
paying
its
bills
of
short
of
cash.
now,
i
have
more
to
say
about
that
shortly.
after
this
motion
was
filed
on
january
19th,
on
the
1st
of
march,
about
six
weeks
thereafter,
the
government
filed
its
opposition
material.
this
consisted
of
two
affidavits
and
an
accountant
and
the
economist,
coupled
with
various
supporting
documents
and
schedules
which
in
the
view
of
the
accountant
and
the
economist
demonstrated
that
this
company
was
not
a
failing
company.
and
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
considerable
length
the
various
economic
factors
which
were
relied
upon
the
criteria
financial
analysis
to
show
that
this
company
was
not
failing
at
that
time.
i
just
like
to
infer
here
briefly
to
three
or
four
of
the
most
significant
ones.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
why
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
mr.
justice.
in
this
case
of
course,
we
sought
to
enjoin
it
that
before
the
acquisition
disputed.
i
would
think
the
critical
thing
would
be
as
of
the
time
of
the
acquisition
in
this
case.
but
we
think
that
in
making
that
determination,
you
must
look
behind
the
immediate
period
of
acquisition
and
trace
the
whole
history
of
the
company.
now,
the
first
factor
we
relied
on
is
that
this
company
had
a
remarkable
sales
growth
in
the
15
years
preceding
the
acquisition.
beginning
in
1944,
it
sales
were
a
little
over
million
dollars.
by
1949,
five
years
later,
it
sales
have
increased
to
$5,000,000.
the
following
five
years
later
in1954,
the
sales
was
$6,000,008.
and
by
1957,
these
company
sales
have
increased
to
$10,672,000.
now,
need
to
the
two
years
following
this
as
the
appellees
make
great
point
of,
the
sales
drop
to
up
by
$300,000.
but
1959,
the
last
full
year
before
the
acquisition,
i
might
mention
this
company
was
on
a
fiscal
year
basis
so
that
the
year
we're
talking
of
for
herring-hall-marvin
is
the
year
ending
30th
of
june.
and
the
last
full
fiscal
year
before
the
acquisition,
the
company
still
had
sales
of
$10,023,000,
the
third
highest
in
its
history
and
approximately
double
with
the
sales
had
been
13
years
before
1959.
and
we
think
that
while
there
has
been
some
drop
off,
the
company
still
showed
a
very
substantial
sales
at
that
period.
at
the
same
time
that
the
company
had
have
this
growth
in
sales,
it
had
a
history
of
successful
operations
for
the
five
fiscal
years
before
the
merge
in
1955
to
1959,
its
net
income
always
exceeded
$100,000.
in
one
year,
it
was
as
high
as
$250,000.
and
for
each
of
the
three
preceding
years,
it
was
better
than
$180,000
and
the
last
year,
1959,
it
was
$187,000,
a
few
thousand
dollars
higher
than
each
of
the
two
preceding
years.
and
this
net
income
of
the
company
showed
more
than
a
return
of
more
than
11%
after
taxes
for
the
five
average
years
and
almost
9%
after
taxes
for
the
year
1959.
now,
as
of
the
close
of
the
past
fiscal
year,
june
30th
1959,
this
company
herring-hall-marvin
had
no
long-term
debt.
it
had
previously,
in
1955,
had
a
mortgage
of
$325,000.
this
had
all
been
paid
off
by
june
30th,
1958.
that
is
one
year
before
the
closing
of
the
fiscal
year.
in
addition
to
that,
in
the
fiscal
year
in
1959,
the
company
had
reduced
its
liability
on
notes
and
loans
payable
from
approximately
$700,000
to
$300,000.
another
fact
that
we
think
is
significant
was
that
over
the
15-year
period,
the
company's
retained
earnings
had
grown
tremendously
starting
with
a
deficit
of
$300,000
in
1944.
they
rose
to
more
than
$2,000,000
in
1959.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
from
a
company's
published
financial
state.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
but
well,
there
are
two
claims.
the
first
claim
is
that
the
books
did
not
show
the
correct
picture.
in
the
sense,
they
fail
to
reflect
the
cash
shortage.
there
is
one
other
finding,
however,
which
i
would
like
to
infer
to.
the
district
court
found
and
finding
13
at
pages
564
to
565.
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke
myself,
it's
finding
20
at
page
567,
states
and
although
the
annual
balance
sheets
in
profit
and
law
statements
purported
to
show
a
modus
improvement
in
the
company's
financial
condition
from
year-to-year.
these
books
fail
--
figures
failed
completely
to
reflect
the
actually
insolvent
condition
of
the
company.
and
then
the
court
makes
the
statement,
“the
books
who
prepared
in
accordance
with
management
policy.”
now,
this
latter
statement
that
the
books
who
prepared
in
accordance
with
management
policy.
rest
exclusively
on
a
memorandum
set
forth
at
page
560
of
the
record,
which
was
a
confidential
memorandum
for
mr.
mosman,
the
president
of
the
company
to
the
treasurer
of
the
company,
in
which
he
suggested,
“i
would
like
the
following
things
to
be
done
before
the
end
of
june.”
and
he
sets
out
four
things
he'd
like
to
have
done
to
make
certain
payments
and
then
he
says,
“i
would
like
to
show
a
net
profit
after
taxes
of
at
least
$150,000.”
and
then
he
says,
“i
would
like
to
show
a
net
worth
of
approximately
$2,100,000.”
and
next
to
each
one
of
this
remarks
of
that
the
initial
is,
okay.
and
then
as
a
concluding
statement
of
the
end
of
thing
saying,
he
urges
mr.
(inaudible)
to
see
if
we
can
work
toward
these
goals.
now
this,
we
think
is
a
--
an
ambiguous
document,
we
don't
know
what
this
means.
there
was
no
testimony
as
to
what
this
means.
it's
of
course
susceptible
to
the
interpretation
given
it
by
the
district
court
that
the
books
were
adjusted
that
year
to
show
this
thing.
it
may
also
be
no
more
that
a
hope
and
expectation
by
mr.
mosman
to
the
treasurer
that
he
hopes
the
company
will
be
able
to
achieve
these
results.
furthermore,
this
relates
only
to
one
year,
and
certainly
affords
no
basis
for
the
court's
general
finding
that
these
books
are
defective
for
the
entire
period.
and
finally,
the
mere
facts
of
that
in
a
company
like
this,
there
were
some
adjustments
made
to
show
profit
after
taxes
for
$150,000
or
net
worth
of
$2,100,000
does
not
itself
prove
that
the
books
were
misleading
because
there
are
many
areas
in
which
adjustments
--
accounting
adjustments
maybe
made
in
one
year
or
the
other
in
which
would
affect
the
particular
showing
in
that
year.
now,
one
other
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
court
didn't
find
the
books
were
full
supplied.
the
court
found
that
these
books
did
not
reflect
the
true
status
of
the
company.
there's
one
other
fact
that
i
just
like
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
difference
is
that
if
the
books
have
been
full
supplied,
intentionally
full
supplied,
you
could
say
that
--
if
there
were
such
a
finding,
you
could
fairly
conclude
that
the
--
the
books
weren't
worth
anything
because
they
did
not
reflect
any
of
the
conditions.
but
where
the
finding
is
that
they
didn't
accurately
reflect
the
condition
of
the
company
where
that
finding
as
we
think
doesn't
rest
on
anything
that
supports
it,
we
think
in
that
circumstance,
the
books
of
the
company
do
show,
do
accurately
reflect
the
condition
of
the
company.
i
might
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
court
found
otherwise,
but
we
think
without
basis
in
this
record.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct,
but
we
think
that
finding
is
not
supported
by
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
finding?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
finding
as
far
as
i
can
tell
mr.
justice,
is
based
on
this
memorandum
that
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
read
to
you,
because
the
finding
quotes
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
are
statements
by
the
accountants
relating
to
the
shortages
of
cash.
and
there
is
the
evidence
that
at
the
time
when
the
transaction
was
ended
into,
mr.
mosman
gave
his
company
a
balance
sheet
which
showed
receivables
and
ca
--
showed
cash
of
$115,000
and
later
on
before
the
transaction
was
consummated.
he
advised
the
diebold
company
that
that
in
that
balance
sheet,
he
didn't
properly
shown
$100,000
of
cash
which
in
fact
were
receivables.
there
is
that.
but
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
--
that
is
there
basic
--
that
is
--
i
think
excellence
substance
of
their
case
basically.
their
case
turns
on
the
cash
shortage
and
then
i'll
explain
what
that
is
about.
this
company
we
concede
was
in
difficulties
in
1959
with
its
cash
position,
it
was
short
of
cash.
and
it
followed
a
practice
of
frequently
when
invoices
would
come
in
of
drawing
the
check
and
payment
of
the
invoice
and
withholding
the
dispatch
of
that
check
for
a
period
sometimes
two
or
sometimes
three
months.
now,
the
calculation
as
upon
which
diebold's
case
rests
assumes
that
all
of
these
checks
that
had
been
drawn
but
had
not
been
released
were
in
fact
presented
for
payment.
and
if
all
those
checks
have
been
presented
for
payment
as
of
the
date
on
which
they
withdrawn,
there
were
not
sufficient
funds
in
the
bank
at
that
time
to
pay
them
all.
of
course,
the
checks
were
not
always
presented
for
payment
at
that
time.
and
the
record
is
uncontradicted
that
at
no
time
during
this
alleged
critical
period
was
any
check
drawn
by
herring-hall-marvin
ever
refused
payment
by
the
bank.
in
other
words,
there
were
always
sufficient
funds
available
in
the
bank
to
permit
the
payment
of
the
checks.
and
we
just
don't
know
why
this
thing
was
done.
we
don't
know
for
how
long
this
practice
had
been
followed.
it
certainly
is
not
inconceivable
that
since
mr.
mosman
was
anxious
to
sell
this
company,
before
we
now
he
may
have
intended
to
conduct
his
operation
on
a
thin
cash
basis,
so
that
when
he
can
to
sell
the
company,
he
could
show
a
company
that
was
free
from
many
long-term
debt.
this
company
at
one
time,
it
had
a
mortgage
which
had
been
paid
off.
i
also
like
to
suggest
since
diebold
urges
that
there's
been
no
showing
of
any
in
way
in
which
this
company
could've
obviated
his
problems,
that
at
the
time
when
this
cash
shortage
become
critical,
we
think
that
diebold
at
least
could've
explored
the
possibility
of
seeking
to
put
on
some
long-term
in
debits.
we
don't
know
whether
mr.
mosman
could
or
couldn't
have
but
certainly
this
should
have
been
explored.
the
company
admittedly
had
barrowed
to
the
limit
of
its
possibilities
and
its
principle
depository
in
the
city
of
hamilton,
its
main
city.
it
could,
however,
at
least
have
sought
to
borrow
some
additional
funds
and
some
of
its
other
depository.
now,
there's
one
other
thing
which
we
think
here
is
quite
significant
on
dealing
with
the
problem
of
whether
this
was
a
failing
company.
and
that
is
the
content
of
the
seller,
mr.
mosman
during
this
entire
--
this
entire
transaction.
one
would
normally
think
that
if
you
had
a
company
that
was
failing
and
that
you
saw
the
end
rapidly
approaching,
you
would
be
anxious
to
try
to
sell
this
company
on
the
best
possible
term,
if
you
wouldn't
insist
of
tremendous
demands.
you'd
also
think
that
once
you
had
accomplished
a
sale
on
favorable
terms,
you
would
be
anxious
to
go
through
with
it.
mr.
mosman,
this
record
shows,
didn't
do
either
of
these
things.
first
of
all,
he
repeatedly
insisted
that
the
sale
be
only
for
cash
and
all
cash
sales
what
he
wanted.
secondly,
on
two
occasions,
first
after
the
option
had
been
executed
and
secondly,
after
the
contract
had
been
signed,
he
tried
to
get
out
of
the
contract.
in
the
first
occasion,
the
result
was
the
company
was
forced
to
improve
the
terms.
he
first
tried
to
get
out
of
the
contract
when
word
got
out
of
this
deal.
he
claimed
that
there'd
been
a
matter
that
you'd
be
kept
confidential.
and
when
word
got
out
of
this
deal,
he
tried
to
get
out.
he,
again,
tried
to
get
out
of
this
contract
when
both
companies
received
an
inquiry
from
the
department
of
justice.
and
finally,
at
the
time
the
government
sought
its
preliminary
injunction,
affidavits
were
filed
both
by
mr.
mosman
and
by
mr.
koontz,
the
president
of
diebold.
and
both
of
these
affidavits,
there
was
no
reference
at
all
to
any
claim
that
this
company
was
failing.
both
affidavits
indicated
that
mr.
mosman
had
stated
two
reasons
why
he
wanted
to
sell
this
company.
first,
he
needed
a
cash
to
pay
his
estate
taxes.
secondly,
he
was
concerned
that
there
was
no
available
management
personnel
to
takeover
the
company
if
he
should
retire
or
quit.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case,
we
think
stand
in
short
contrast
to
the
facts
in
the
international
shoe
case.
the
international
shoe
case,
the
court
concluded
that
without
regard
to
the
effect
on
competition,
the
acquisition
thereby
international
shoe
of
the
makwanyane
case
did
not
substantially
less
in
competition
and
hence
was
beyond
the
reach
of
section
7.
but
in
international
shoe,
the
acquired
company
was
truly
in
a
serious
predicament.
in
the
year
before
the
acquisition,
it
had
lost
$6,000,000
as
distinguished
from
this
company
wherein
the
year
before
the
acquisition
had
made
$187,000.
in
the
year
before
the
acquisition,
it
had
exhausted
a
$4,000,000
surplus
and
pilot
for
$4,000,00
deficit.
in
contrast
to
this
company,
which
in
the
year
before
the
acquisition,
it's
substantially
improved
its
current
surplus,
at
that
--
in
the
year
of
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
company
owed
$15,000,000
to
the
banks
and
$2,000,000
on
current
account.
here
again
in
the
present
case,
the
company
had
reduced
its
intendedness
to
the
banks
and
had
no
long-term
debt.
now,
in
the
another
important
fact
that
was
in
the
international
shoe
case,
this
court
emphasize
that
the
officers
of
the
acquired
company
after
a
long
and
careful
consideration
of
the
situation
had
concluded
that
the
company
was
faced
with
financial
ruin
and
that
the
only
alternatives
presented
were
liquidation
through
a
receiver
or
outright
sale.
we
have
referred
in
our
brief
to
the
record
in
the
international
shoe
case
in
which
the
officers
testified
that
day-after-day,
they
try
to
see
what
else
could
they
do
in
this
company
that
was
failing,
and
the
only
alternative
that
seemed
open
to
them
was
a
sale
to
the
international
shoe
company.
in
the
present
case,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
mr.
mosman
thought
his
company
was
failing,
that
he
studied
other
possible
methods
of
disposing
of
it,
or
indeed
as
i've
indicated
that
the
financial
difficulties
with
the
course
of
the
sale.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
don't
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
but
let
me
state
some
of
the
other
material
they
rely
on,
because
i
don't
want
to
get
the
thought
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
some
other
material
which
mr.
mcgovern
i'm
sure
will
allude
to
in
details.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
we
say
that
all
of
this
material
--
all
of
this
material
does
not
refute
our
showing
of
the
basically
healthy
condition
of
this
company.
and
i
just
want
to
emphasize
before
sitting
down.
once
again
the
context
in
which
this
issue
arises,
the
--
this
case
is
a
frequent
presented
as
a
narrow
issue
as
the
company
failing
or
isn't
it
failing.
it
sometimes
sounds
as
though
were
bankruptcy
proceeding.
this
was
a
broad
on
that.
the
basic
issue
in
this
situation
is
whether
the
condition
of
a
company
is
such
that
its
acquisition
by
a
competitor,
by
a
competitor
which
would
ordinarily
violates
section
7
other
things
being
equal,
may
nevertheless
to
be
held
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
and
that
the
case
maybe
dismissed
without
any
inquiry
as
to
the
actual
effect
on
competition.
and
we
think
that
before
such
a
dismissal
maybe
sanctioned,
it's
important
that
there'd
be
a
very
clear
and
definite
showing
that
the
company
is
truly
failing
in
the
sense
that
if
it
we're
not
for
the
acquisition,
the
company
could
not
continue
as
an
independent
competitor.
and
i
think
one
of
the
significant
factors
here
i
just
like
to
just
mention
is
that
in
this
situation,
there
were
other
perspective
purchases
for
the
company.
three
people
indicated
interest
in
this
company,
at
least
one
of
them
was
very
serious
about
it.
and
this
again
is
in
contrast
with
international
shoe
where
the
court
twice
stressed
that
they
were
no
other
purchases.
and
of
course,
if
there's
another
purchaser
who
may
be
available
to
acquire
as
a
company,
this
which
we
think
a
different
completion
on
the
case,
because
if
there's
another
purchaser
it
means
that
the
company
despite
its
adverse
condition
may
nevertheless
continue
as
a
competitor
if
it's
operated
by
this
other
person.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
because
it's
very
significant
in
considering
this
case
that
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
which
was
signed
on
july
17th.
from
then
on,
diebold
had
undertaken
to
pay
all
of
the
liabilities
of
this
company.
and
for
example,
mr.
mcgovern
made
a
great
deal
of
the
fact
that
the
company
had
piled
up
larger
amount
of
overdue
trade
bill.
but
most
of
this
overdue
trade
bills
from
the
past
bills
were
during
the
months
of
july
and
august
in
the
first
10
days
of
september.
and
similarly,
the
amount
of
money,
the
$300,00
that
mr.
mcgovern
that
pointed
out,
they
had
to
advance
almost
immediately
after
the
closing
again.
this
seems
to
us
is
merely
the
reflection
of
the
obligation
which
they
assumed
to
pay
all
the
indebtedness
of
this
company
as
of
the
date
of
the
closing.
now,
we
don't
dis
--
we
don't
deny.
we
can't
deny
on
this
record
that
this
company
had
a
great
deal
problems
and
many
problems
with
respect
to
its
cash
position.
but
the
fact
is
that
at
no
time,
at
no
time
during
this
history
had
this
company
ever
been
unable
to
meet
any
check
that
was
actually
presented
for
payment?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
is
this,
that
most
of
the
pre-trial,
the
depositions
that
were
refer
to,
were
taken
before
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
made.
and
that
the
depositions
were
not
focused
on
all
of
this
material
which
was
brought
out
in
the
lybrand
brother's
report.
i
think
for
example,
if
we
have
a
further
hearing,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
put
mr.
mosman
on
the
stand
to
find
out
from
just
why
he
was
doing
this,
how
long
these
practices
that
continued
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
think
the
motivation
maybe
significant
in
the
determining
the
basic
situation.
in
other
words,
was
this
really
a
company
that
was
getting
in
hot
water
or
was
this
something
that
mr.
mosman
was
doing
for
his
own
reasons
because
he
wished
to
keep
a
company
that
was
free
of
any
long
term
debt?
what
attempts
had
he
made?
it's
mentioned
here
that
the
company
had
paid
its
legal
limit.
if
i
may
just
point
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
the
company
--
it's
pointed
out
that
the
company
was
up
to
its
legal
limit
with
its
bank.
that
was
the
legal
limit
on
unsecured
demand
note.
and
i
--
i
think
it
would
have
been
relevant
to
determine
the
whole
history
of
this
company
in
the
light
of
what
of
the
record
show
on
its
previous
satisfactory
position.
thank
you.
