mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suggest
if
the
court
please
that
the
only
essential
difference
between
the
government
and
ourselves
here
is
really
one
of
perspectives.
the
government
points
to
the
long
range
fortunes
of
mr.
mosman
as
hhm
company
in
the
burgeoning
economy
that
followed
upon
the
demand
created
by
world
war
ii.
we
emphasize
the
rim,
short-run
factors
that
faced
him
with
the
slim
operating
capital
in
the
recession
market
of
1958,
1959.
it
is
the
fact
and
the
government
concedes
this
that
at
all
times
from
1946
down
through
the
sale
on
september
10th
of
1959,
hhm
was
extremely
short
of
working
capital.
this
factor
both
sides
concede.
it's
our
contention
that
that
being
the
case,
that
whatever
the
relative
merits
of
the
long
and
short
run
view
of
a
company's
economic
health
may
be
in
other
circumstances
that
where
you
are
trying
to
gage
the
survival
prospects
of
a
company
in
an
adverse
market
with
slim
working
capital
historically
and
at
that
very
time
that
then
the
only
relevant
critical
criteria
you
have
available
is
the
short
run
view,
will
he
survive?
the
long
run
view
we
suggest,
is
a
luxury
for
a
man
like
mosman
that
we
just
couldn't
afford
to
indulge.
it
wasn't
a
question,
if
the
court
pleases,
whether
mr.
mosman
would
be
alive
in
ten
years
hence.
the
question
was
would
he
be
alive
tomorrow,
next
week,
or
six
months
hence.
as
john
maynard
keynes
once
remarked,
“we'll
all
be
dead
in
a
long
run.”
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
on
this
record,
it's
pretty
clear
that
have
this
sale
not
taking
place
as
it
did.
on
september
10th
of
1959,
mr.
mosman
and
hhm
would
have
been
dead.
in
fact,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
most
government
fiscal
expert
themselves
is
almost
universally
agree
that
where
you
are
considering
the
survival
prospects
of
a
company
with
marginal
working
capital,
you
must
realize
that
that
marginal
working
capital
position
subjects
that
company
to
the
constant
jeopardy
of
insolvency
if
there
is
suddenly
an
adverse
turn
in
the
market.
and
i
should
like
to
address
the
court's
attention
to
the
united
states
department
of
commerce's
own
hand
book
for
businessmen,
guides
for
business
analysis,
which
contains
this
warning
about
the
very
situation
before
the
court
today.
i'm
quoting,
“it
should
be
emphasized
that
when
sales
are
supported
by
an
inadequate
working
capital,
the
very
delicate
balance
of
incoming
and
outgoing
funds
that
results
is
easily
upset
with
any
interruption
in
the
flow
of
funds
such
as
the
sudden
loss
of
sales
or
poor
collection
performance.”
now
as
mr.
friedman
mentioned,
whatever
the
historical
growth
of
this
company
over
a
period
of
14
years
have
been,
beginning
with
the
recession
of
1957,
in
the
next
two
succeeding
years
that
have
suffered
a
loss
in
sales
of
approximately
$300,000
in
each
of
those
years.
its
inventories
built
up
correlatively
and
operating
on
a
low
cash
margin,
it
began
to
be
in
grim
financials
grace.
and
it's
our
contention
that
when
the
business
recession
of
1957
through
1959
hit
that
hhm's
ability
to
survive
particularly
in
this
critical
period
in
1959
could
only
be
tested
by
the
short
run
factors
that
affected
his
constant
day-to-day
opportunity
to
be
alive
tomorrow.
now,
if
the
court
please,
what
were
those
critical
short-term
factors
that
the
district
court
found
so
persuasive
on
this
point?
the
first
fact
that
we
must
start
with
here
is
that
at
every
point
from
january
1
down
--
january
1
of
1959
down
through
april,
down
to
september
rather
of
1959,
the
date
of
the
actual
acquisition,
i
think
there
was
no
argument
on
the
phase
of
this
record
that
hhm
was
in
solvent
by
any
customary
test.
and
certainly
by
the
simplest
test
of
all
that
during
that
nine-month
period,
that
critical
period
before
the
court
for
determination
in
this
case,
during
that
entire
period,
hhm
was
unable
to
meet
its
debts
as
they
matured.
now,
if
the
curt
please,
that
is
set
forth
and
demonstrated
by
an
indisputable
showing
in
the
record.
at
235,
we
have
a
nagging
of
the
past-due
accounts
of
the
herring-hall-marvin
company,
made
mind
you
by
lybrand
ross
brothers
and
montgomery
who
were
herring-hall-marvin's
accountants.
they
were
not
diebold's
accountants
and
have
never
been
diebold's
accountants.
that
aging
schedule,
--
schedule
aging
at
235
of
the
record,
shows
that
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
on
september
10th,
he
had
244,000,
approximately
a
quarter
of
a
million,
past-due
accounts
going
back
to
sometime
prior
to
january
1,
1959.
now
over
and
above
that,
if
the
court
please,
he
also
had
$500,000
of
currently
due
accounts.
but
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
from
january
1,
1959,
right
down
from
the
closing,
he
was
insolvent
in
the
sense
that
he
could
not
pay
his
debts
as
they
matured.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i
beg
you
pardon
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
this
--
this
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
this
order
was
made
by
lybrand
ross
after
the
transaction.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
they
were
not
--
have
no
one
to
mr.
chief
justice.
and
we
regret
to
say
that
until
the
time
we
finally
had
discovery
of
the
company's
files,
during
the
course
of
the
pretrial
discovery
in
the
case
itself,
we
were
ourselves
completely
unaware
of
the
conditions
that
we're
going
on
in
back
of
the
formal
published
book
reports
of
the
company.
we
knew
the
company
was
in
some
difficulty,
after
all
most
companies
were
in
some
difficulty
during
that
period
of
time.
we,
ourselves,
were
primarily
concerned
about
getting
plant
space.
we
knew
he
had
plant
space,
and
i
want
to
underscore
this
proposition.
the
only
direct
intimate
knowledge,
first
hand
knowledge
we
had
of
a
company's
operations
or
assets
or
facilities
prior
to
the
sale
was
a
personal
viewing
of
the
plant.
our
treasurer
was
allowed
to
walk
through
the
plant,
see
the
facilities,
see
the
tools,
jigs
and
dice
and
see
the
inventory.
we
never
saw
a
book
of
any
kind
other
than
this
april
30th
balance
sheet
which
he
gave
us
which
as
mr.
friedman
has
pointed
out
was
phony.
that's
the
only
word
you
can
use
to
describe
it
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
but
i
should
like
to
point
out
the
over
and
above
this
aging
schedule,
which
reflects
on
the
face
of
the
data
itself
irretrievably
that
the
company
was
unable
to
meet
its
debts
as
they
matured.
we
also
have
a
schedule
of
checks
that
were
issued
by
the
company
and
that
board
cancellation
stamps
on
the
back
of
the
checks
ranging
from
anywhere
from
one
to
six
months
after
the
date
that
was
written
on
the
check.
now,
those
checks
are
set
forth
in
the
record
at
556.
and
i
would
like
to
come
to
just
one
of
those
checks
to
give
the
court
some
impression
of
the
incredible
nature
of
this
operation
prior
to
the
time
that
we
took
it
over.
at
page
556
to
the
record,
if
the
court
please,
there
are
set
forth
a
number
of
examples
of
checks
taken
at
random
from
the
--
the
various
checks
and
accounts
of
hhm.
we
could
have
larded
this
record
out,
let
me
say
in
passing
by
including
thousand
upon
thousand
of
these
checks,
but
this
due
the
purpose
as
well,
they
are
a
sample,
they
were
taken
at
random.
i
should
like
to
address
the
court's
attention
to
check
number
7
--
7
--
17471.
a
check
made
out
to
the
aluminum
company
of
america
in
the
amount
of
$16,494.
that
check
for
a
date
on
its
face
of
january
15th,
1959,
the
first
cancellation
stamp
on
the
back
of
the
check
is
april
10th,
1959.
now,
the
stableness
of
these
checks
resulted
from
a
rather
fabulous
practice
engaged-in
by
hhm
as
its
cash
got
shorter
and
shorter
and
its
predators
began
to
press
more
and
more.
the
company
through
mr.
mosman
and
his
treasure
were
compelled
to
resort
to
something
i
can
only
describe
as
an
extraordinary
piece
of
financial
leisure
demand.
they
employed
a
little
device
that
is
now
known
on
the
face
of
this
record
as
the
“little
black
box.”
as
predators
--
trade
predators
invoices
matured
and
were
approved
for
payment,
they
would
write
the
check.
but
the
treasurer
would
be
fully
aware
at
that
time
that
he
had
no
money
in
the
bank
to
cover
the
check
that
indeed
in
fact
at
that
very
time,
the
company
had
substantial
overdrafts
outstanding
against
its
existing
bank
balances.
therefore,
he
would
put
the
check
in
what
is
known
as
the
"little
black
box",
it
would
stay
in
that
little
black
box
for
periods
of
up
to
90
to
120
days
until
such
time
as
the
treasurer
felt
he
could
safely
predict
that
when
that
check
went
out
through
circulation
in
the
flotation
of
checks
he
had
going,
and
got
back
to
the
bank,
there
would
be
money
in
the
bank
to
cover
it.
now,
that
flotation
was
carried
on
during
most
of
the
entire
month
--
during
most
of
the
entire
first
nine
months
of
the
year.
it's
extraordinary
that
at
no
time,
if
one
of
those
checks
actually
get
refuse
payment
at
the
bank.
down
to
the
very
end,
there
was
always
at
least
a
small
cash
balance
in
the
bank
to
cover
the
checks
as
they
came
back.
however,
this
flotation
situation
was
audited
thoroughly
by
lybrand
ross
and
there
was
just
no
doubt
on
the
face
of
this
record.
and
indeed,
the
government
doesn't
really
dispute
this.
there
is
just
no
doubt
on
the
base
of
his
record,
that
it
was
this
flotation
of
checks,
this
dexterous
handling
of
the
circulation
of
the
checks
through
banks
for
all
across
the
country,
that
kept
this
company
of
float
for
an
additional
seven
or
eight
months
during
this
critical
period
in
1959,
when
frankly
the
company
was
financially
bleeding
to
death.
that's
what
the
record
compels
want
to
conclude.
with
respect
to
mr.
friedman's
suggestion
that
nobody
knows
how
many
checks
get
out
that
little
black
box,
i
will
concede
that
is
true.
nobody
does
and
nobody
ever
will.
but
what
lybrand
ross
did
was
look
only
at
the
cancelation
stamp
on
the
back
of
the
checks
and
they
certified
as
checks
in
float
on
any
given
date,
only
checks
would
have
a
bank
cancellation
stamp
on
the
back
of
them.
so
however
it
may
have
been
with
other
checks,
in
a
little
black
box,
we
know
conclusively
that
the
checks
to
get
out
in
float
and
got
a
bank
cancellation
stamp
had
actually
been
issue
because
they
were
in
circulation.
the
lybrand
ross
figures,
therefore
if
the
court
please,
we
submit
minimum
figures.
we
know
he
had
a
minimum
of
this
amount
outstanding
and
in
float.
we
never
will
know
the
maximum
of
course.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
they
did.
the
difficulty
mr.
justice
clark
is
that
of
course
we're
now
going
back,
trying
to
reconstruct
this
--
l
say
rather
incredible
picture
of
operations
in
1959.
the
black
box
is
long
since
gone.
we
cannot
be
sure
for
example
that
in
a
date
with
lybrand
ross
suggest
on
the
base
of
cancellation
stamps
from
the
back
of
the
checks
that
there
was
an
overdraft
outstanding
in
all
the
accounts,
let's
say
in
the
amount
of
$75,000.
we
cannot
be
sure
that
they
were
not
in
additional
$50,000
or
$60,000
of
checks
floating
around
that
have
not
yet
clear
the
bank
because
lybrand
ross
certified
only
with
respect
to
checks
that
had
a
bank
cancellation
stamp
on
the
back.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
no,
if
you
permit
me
mr.
justice
clark,
they
wouldn't
kick
the
check
out
of
the
box
into
float
until
they
could
predict
it
by
the
time
the
check
cleared
all
the
banks
that
have
to
clear
and
get
back,
there
would
be
funds
in
the
bank
at
time
to
cover
it.
they
have
no
funds
in
the
bank
at
the
time
it
was
issued
to
cover
it.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
that's
right.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
that's
right.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
they
would
not
have
had
enough
money
in
the
bank
to
cover
that
check
on
the
date
it
was
sent
out.
that's
absolutely
right.
the
lybrand
ross
reports
are
absolutely
clear.
that
as
of
a
given
day,
they
were
overdrafts
in
the
amount
as
high
as
$75,000
out
floating
around
in
circulation,
checks
to
banks
out
in
the
west
coast,
checks
to
credit
it
in
new
york,
maine,
elsewhere,
just
floating
around.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
they
all
paid
--
well,
after
the
closing
on
september
10th
of
1959,
i
regret
to
say
that
a
large
number
to
the
tune
of
about
300,000
were
paid
for
by
us.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
they
were
out
in
the
mails.
but
at
the
day
of
the
closing
on
september
10th,
mr.
mosman
informed
us
at
the
closing
they
could
not
give
us.
we
are
buying
the
assets
of
the
company.
he
informed
us
he
could
not
give
us
a
check
for
his
bank
balances
because
on
that
date,
he
had
overdraft
outstanding.
and
those
overdrafts
came
back
into
the
next
60
days
to
dug
our
own
efforts
to
try
to
put
the
company
back
on
its
feet.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
we
did
not
know.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
that's
right.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
yes,
we
are
obligated
to
buy
at
whatever
time
mr.
mosman
would
finally
convene
his
stockholders
and
got
their
approval
to
go
ahead
for
the
sale.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
well,
we
have
an
option
to
begin
what
the
option
was
exercised.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
the
record
shows
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
say
between
about
some
time
around
july
20th
and
the
actual
closing
was
on
september
10th.
the
difficulty
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
we
didn't
arrange
for
more
audits.
we
were
entitled
of
more
audits
either
under
the
contract
unfortunately.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
we
did
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
no,
we
didn't
think
the
company
was
in
reasonably
good
shape.
i
say
we
know
from
trade
scuttle
bug,
we
knew
my
wrong
difficulties
in
selling
at
time
that
the
--
there
was
recession
on,
there
were
adverse
conditions
effecting
the
market.
no
argument
about
--
that
everybody
knew
it.
steel
company's
knew
it,
we
knew
it,
everybody
knew
it.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
no.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
no
we
did
not.
except
insofar
as
one
could
now
look
back
on
this
situation,
say
we
should
have
been
alerted
to
the
fact
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
we
certainly
did
mr.
justice
white.
we
thought
we
were
buying
a
variable
company.
we
knew
i
say
that
they
were
--
they
were
having
some
difficulties
but
we
never
have
those
remorse
ideas
that
would
ever
in
cover
the
kind
of
a
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
but
this
thing
is
so
extraordinary,
i
don't
think
that
any
rational
person
ever
could've
conceived
of
it.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
no.
we
have
never
contended
that,
only
because
of
the
fact
that
so
difficult
to
figure
out
how
you
would
evaluate
his
liabilities
and
his
assets.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
if
you
take
all
this
floating
checks
outstanding,
if
you
take
his
demand
notes
to
the
bank,
you
see,
he
had
borrowed
the
limit
--
the
legal
limit
of
his
local
bank
to
lend
him
money
and
demand
notes
by
the
tune
of
about
$300,000
just
prior
to
the
closing.
we,
again,
had
to
pick
up
those
demand
notes
and
merely
upon
taking
over
the
company
because
the
bank
calls
to
their
payment.
the
bank
as
his
own
bank
has
testified
on
deposition
that
had
they
themselves
being
compelled
by
a
bank
examiner
to
cause
mr.
mosman
to
liquidate
anyone
of
those
notes
that
they
didn't
know
where
he
would
have
gotten
the
money.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
tangible
net
worth?
i
would
rather
not
tell
you
mr.
justice
white.
why
would
tangible
net
worth
is
only
because
the
factor
i
get
frankly
confused
with
these
accounting
concepts.
i
think
like
the
district
court,
i
myself
tend
to
deal
with
the
situation
that
is
tangible
for
me.
a
man
writes
a
check
and
hadn't
gotten
money
in
the
bank
that
covered
it,
i
figured
he's
in
bad
shaped
because
i
regard
that
as
a
strategy
of
desperation.
and
whatever
else
this
record
suggested
about
mr.
mosman,
it
doesn't
make
him
out
as
a
complete
charlotte.
i
think
quite
clear
these
practices
that
were
engaged
in
because
he
was
desperate
short
of
cash
and
he
had
no
choice.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
yes,
i
would
say
so.
yes,
i
say
mr.
justice
white,
all
we
emphasize
with
regard
to
our
first
major
proposition
here
is
that
certainly
the
man
was
insolvent.
in
the
equities
sense,
he
could
not
pay
his
debts
that
they
matured,
that
much
as
clear.
there
is
no
argument
about
that
on
the
record.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
it'd
be
the
slightest
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
the
only
significance
for
us
mr.
chief
justice
is
by
virtual
of
doing
the
way
he
did,
we
are
now
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
--
able
to
reconstruct
the
record,
because
we
see
the
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
--
dates.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
mr.
chief
justice
if
we
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
yes.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
nothing
more
in
this
record
than
simply
late
payment
of
bills.
i
would
be
inclined
would
to
agree
that
in
and
off
itself
perhaps
does
not
conclusively
established
anything.
but
i'm
saying
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
story
for
us
here.
that
is
the
beginning
of
the
story,
that
he
was
insolvent
in
the
sense
he
couldn't
pay
his
debts
as
they
matured.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
other
short-term
factors
that
i
suggest.
simply
forced
the
district
court
to
conclude
that
mosman
couldn't
have
survive,
not
for
an
additional
10
days
indeed
at
the
time
we
bought
him.
the
first
thing
was
the
fact
that
in
april
1959,
he
prepared
this
balance
sheet
which
mr.
friedman
has
adverted
to,
in
which
he
reclassified
$100,000
of
receivables
as
cash,
and
then
showed
a
balance
of
$115,000.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
he
was
actually
concealing
on
that
date.
he
wasn't
just
beating
up
a
narrow
cash
position
of
$15,000
to
$115.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
on
very
date,
he
was
concealing
the
fact
that
he
not
only
have
--
not
$15,000,
he
did
not
have
any
money
at
all
in
the
bank
in
terms
of
the
checks
outstanding
because
the
audit
shows
on
that
very
date,
he
was
over
drawn,
he
had
overdrafts
outstanding
in
circulation
in
the
amount
of
$12,650.
the
audit
also
shows
just
to
take
one
sample
month
because
we
couldn't
to
throw
these
tenths
of
thousand
of
checks
for
every
month.
but
to
take
a
sample
month,
the
month
of
may,
the
record
shows
at
page
233,
that
during
the
month
of
may,
he
disbursed
four
consecutive
payrolls
in
amounts
ranging
as
high
as
$56,000
at
a
time
when
he
didn't
have
the
funds
in
his
payroll
account
to
cover
them.
what
he
would
do
is
he
would
issue
$56,000
with
the
checks
on
friday.
and
then
experience
had
taught
him
that
it
took
some
of
those
checks
a
little
time
to
clear
around
town
other
banks
and
get
back.
on
that
date,
he
might
have
$6000
in
his
payroll
account
to
back
up
$56,000
worth
of
checks.
he
would
deposit
additional
$10,000
in
the
account
on
friday
making
a
$16,000
but
with
the
deficit
of
40,000
in
terms
of
those
outstanding
checks.
and
then
during
the
next
four
working
days
of
the
coming
week
monday,
tuesday,
wednesday,
and
thursday,
and
his
own
bankers
testified
on
this
on
record
on
deposition.
he
would
deposit
$10,000
each
day.
in
the
hope
of
highest
hope
that
that
money
would
get
in
there
in
time
to
cover
those
payroll
checks
outstanding.
now,
i
suggest
that
however
else
you
play
fast
and
loosing
the
checking
account
mr.
chief
justice,
you
don't
write
payroll
checks
without
funds
in
the
bank
to
cover
at
the
time
you
write.
that
is
a
crime
in
most
state
of
the
union.
now,
then
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
none
of
to
all
as
far
we
are
concerned
mr.
justice
harlan.
this
accounting,
the
vices
and
these
internal
working
arrangements
are
extraordinary
from
our
point
of
view.
we
have
never
heard
of
any
other
company
engaging
in
them
and
certainly,
we
do
not
and
would
never
think.
for
example
of
issuing
a
payroll
check
and
not
having
to
cash
in
the
bank
that
cover
then
the
day
it's
issued
because
the
employee
he
might
just
pass
and
walk
right
down
to
the
bank
and
try
get
his
check
cashed.
i
think
that
this
mechanism
that
was
established,
the
elaborate
extensive
check
floating
scheme,
the
simultaneously
deposit
of
checks
and
so
forth.
i
suggest
you
--
in
this
all
i
suggest
where
the
devices
of
desperation
forced
upon
on
man
who
was
desperate
to
keep
his
head
above
the
financial
orders.
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
there
was
any
fraud
of
any
kind
going
on
other
than
the
(inaudible)
set
forth
here.
have
in
mind
mr.
justice
harlan
that
this
was
almost
wholly
owned
company.
mr.
mosman,
i
suppose
in
one
sentence
of
the
word,
to
take
the
position
he
was
entitled
to
do
with
his
own
company
what
he
saw
it
did.
the
remaining
stockholders
were
largely
employees
as
wide-pose
so
as
if
he
is
in
company.
now,
these
payroll
checks
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
say
were
issue
without
funds
in
the
bank
at
the
time
where
there
issuance
to
cover
them.
those
deficits
in
the
payroll
account
were
themselves
reimbursed
on
the
following
four
days
of
the
week
by
other
checks
written
on
the
general
account
of
the
company
and
those
checks
themselves
representative
overdrafts
in
the
general
account
because
the
general
account
itself
overdrawn
during
all
this
period
of
time
in
the
sense
that
more
checks
were
outstanding,
there
were
funds
to
cover
them.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
well
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i
say
that
i
cannot
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
man
with
credit
at
the
bank
would
write
a
payroll
check
and
not
have
funds
in
the
bank
to
cover
it.
insofar
as
his
local
bank
is
concerned,
mr.
friedman
knows
better,
because
his
local
bankers
have
loaned
him
their
legal
limit
to
loan
$300,000.
the
record
shows
on
their
deposition,
they
were
pressing
him
to
turn
those
notes
over
because
they
were
concerned
that
a
bank
examiner
coming
through
might
ask
him,
"how
do
you
happen
to
have
these
demand
notes
outstanding
so
long?"
he
couldn't
have
borrowed
any
money
from
his
local
bank
that
is
for
sure.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
on
this
last
point
about
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
--
yes.
the
court
had
found
that
his
local
bankers
found
--
his
local
bankers
testified
that
they
didn't
know
where
he
could
get
the
funds
to
pay
off
his
demand
notes
outstanding
in
the
bank
at
that
time.
with
regards
to
the
implication
and
the
earlier
suggestion
you
made
mr.
chief
justice
as
to
whether
he
had
credit,
let
me
reminds
you
of
the
reference
to
the
record
at
556
where
i
showed
you
a
check
being
written
to
alcoa
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
--
that
check
we
now
know
was
withheld
in
the
little
black
box
for
about
90
days.
your
honor
in
the
record
at
558,
559,
you
will
find
an
exchange
of
correspondence
between
alcoa
and
hhm,
just
prior
to
this
particular
incident
in
january
of
1959
in
which
the
hhm
asked
alcoa
to
give
them
a
90-day
extension
on
credit
terms
and
alcoa
wrote
back
and
said,
"we're
sorry,
we
can't
do
it.
it
would
be
discriminatory
against
all
of
other
accounts.”
and
yet
through
the
practice
of
the
little
black
box,
alcoa
was
compelled
almost
involuntary
to
extend
the
90-day
extension
of
credit.
but
they
have
specifically
refused
at
very
request.
in
the
remaining
time,
may
i
just
advert
briefly
to
one
additional
practice
that
i
think
the
district
court
found
as
it
credible
as
we
did
and
yet
is
set
forth
indisputably
of
the
face
of
the
record.
during
much
of
the
nine
months
of
1959,
mr.
mosman
had
the
habit
of
depositing
simultaneously
in
three
or
more
banks
in
identical
check
representing
a
single
sum
of
money.
to
illustrate
that,
the
record
shows
at
55455
that
on
january
30,
if
he
received
a
check
for
$34,000
of
an
agent
out
in
california,
that
check
was
good
at
represented
a
fund
owing
to
him.
that
was
deposited
in
the
wells
fargo
bank
on
january
30th.
on
the
same
day,
january
30th,
the
company
wrote
three
additional
checks
for
$34,000.
one
upon
wells
fargo
for
deposit
in
the
peoples
--
the
national
of
pittsburgh
one
upon
the
peoples
national
for
deposit
in
the
irving
trust
in
new
york
and
one
upon
the
irving
trust
for
deposit
in
its
own
bank
in
hamilton.
a
single
--
sum
of
money
$34,000
now
appears
on
four
different
bank
statements,
the
result
of
which
was
that
had
an
auditor
try
to
get
a
telegraphic
confirmation
of
funds
on
deposit
on
february
1st,
2nd,
3rd,
or
4th.
they
would
have
shown
a
$136,000
in
the
bank.
well,
as
a
matter
of
actual
factual,
it
was
just
one
single
deposit
of
funds
that's
$34,000
available
in
the
walls
fargo
bank
out
in
california.
now,
as
a
result
of
this
situation,
it
began
to
snowball
out
all
them
as
of
course
your
honor,
will
conceive
that
must
have.
it
begin
to
get
tighter
and
tighter
and
in
september
of
1959,
just
prior
to
the
closing
on
september
13th,
his
bank
balance
in
the
bank
in
hamilton
fell
to
$13.92.
and
the
audit
shows
that
on
the
very
date,
september
3rd,
1959
instead
of
having
$13
even
in
the
bank,
he
had
overdrafts
outstanding
in
the
amount
of
$75,000.
now,
i
am
saying
the
thing
went
on,
operating
loss
is
begin
to
experienced,
beginning
in
july
1st,
so
the
separate
of
an
operating
loss
of
$206,000
between
july
1st
and
september
10th
the
closing,
$206,000
operating
loss,
larger
than
its
entire
net
profit
for
the
entire
preceding
fiscal
year.
now,
those
were
the
factors
among
others
that
cause
the
district
court
to
conclude
that
mosman
not
only
was
insolvent.
but
as
the
district
court
found,
he
was
hopelessly
insolvent
and
he
had
no
prospect
of
survival.
i
should
like
the
remaining
moments
to
come
just
briefly
if
the
court
will
permit
me,
to
the
government's
contention
that
summary
judgment
was
not
the
appropriate
mechanism
for
deciding
this
issue.
your
honors
will
have
in
mind
that
this
summary
judgment
was
entered
by
the
district
court
not
early
in
the
game
as
so
often
happens.
not
merely
upon
affidavits
as
was
the
case,
let's
say
in
dipolar
situation.
but
the
summary
judgment
here
was
entered,
18
months
after
the
suit
was
filed.
it
was
entered
after
the
government
had
had
a
broad
scale
discovery
on
the
rule
34
in
which
literally
thousands
upon
thousands
of
diebold
and
hhm
docs
returned
over
to
government.
that
is
set
forth
in
the
record
at
the
200.
there
were
depositions
taken
with
respect
to
all
the
principle
actors
and
the
drama
before
the
court
here.
they
have
taken
the
deposition
with
full
opportunity
from
cross-examination
of
mr.
warren
mosman,
president
of
hhm,
mr.
raymond
koontz
president
of
diebold.
all
of
the
executive
bosses,
the
most
for
safe
company
and
most
importantly,
they
have
taken
the
depositions
of
mr.
mosman's
own
bankers
in
hamilton.
the
bankers
i
suggest
confirmed
the
fact
that
mr.
mosman
was
in
(inaudible)
and
as
they
testified
and
they
call
upon
the
payroll
is
demand
notes
they
--
who
knew
him
best
of
all.
his
local
bankers,
they
didn't
know
were
he
would
procure
the
funds
to
do
so.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i
would
say
mr.
chief
justice
in
response
to
your
question,
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan
that
of
course
the
appropriate
date
is
the
date
of
the
actual
sale,
september
10th
1959.
now,
obviously
you
may
discover
your
facts
with
respect
to
that
subsequently
as
we
did
here.
but
i
think
that
the
critical
time
for
the
application
of
failing
company
doctrine
would
of
course
be
the
date
of
the
actual
merger.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
terms
of
trying
to
evaluate
what
is
condition
was
at
that
time
mr.
chief
justice,
you
cannot
afford
looking
what
he
was
doing
back
in
1954.
the
question
is,
what
was
he's
doing
during
the
preceding
nine
months.
this
is
the
critical
period
that
determines
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
survive
in
a
circumstance
where
you
have
limited
cash.
where
you've
got
$13
in
the
bank,
there's
no
point
of
looking
head
10
years
and
looking
back
10
years.
with
$13
in
the
bank,
a
$75,000
of
checks
outstanding,
the
question
is,
"will
i
be
alive
tomorrow?"
that
was
the
question
to
which
the
district
court
addressed
itself.
