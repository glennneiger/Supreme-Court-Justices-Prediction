and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
section
112
(c)
(1)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
the
so-called
“boot”
provision
limiting
recognition
of
taxable
gains.
and
also,
by
a
parallel
interpretation,
it
involves
the
interpretation
of
section
112
(e)
of
that
same
code
which
precludes
recognition
of
tax
losses
in
boot
situations.
these
are
the
facts.
the
taxpayer,
turnbow
owned
all
the
stock
comprising
5,000
shares
of
non-voting
common
stock
of
international
dairy
supply
company,
a
nevada
corporation
engaged
in
the
business
of
dehydrating
milk,
shipping
it
abroad,
reconstituting
it
as
fluid
milk,
chocolate
milk,
and
the
like
and
supplying
it
in
foreign
countries
to
the
united
states
armed
forces
in
those
countries.
foremost
dairy
company,
a
new
york
corporation
was
engaged
in
distributing
milk
and
dairy
products
in
this
country.
these
parties
entered
in
the
negotiations
culminating
in
a
so-called
a
mandatory
agreement.
under
these
terms,
turnbow
exchanged
or
transferred
all
of
the
voting
stock
of
supply
to
foremost
in
exchange
for
82,375
shares
of
the
voting
stocks
of
foremost
plus
$3
million
cash.
supply
was
then
to
continue
in
business
as
an
operating
subsidiary
of
foremost.
it
was
not
to
make
any
distribution
to
shareholders
either
under
the
plan
or
otherwise.
there
were
other
provisions
that
made
extensive
changes
in
the
management
of
the
two
companies.
the
number
of
directors
of
supply
was
to
be
changed
to
six,
so
that
turnbow
could
maintain
three
directors,
and
foremost
could
elect
three
directors.
an
executive
committee
of
three
was
created,
two
of
them
to
be
nominated
by
foremost.
turnbow
was
to
be
president
and
general
manager
of
supply,
while
the
president
of
foremost
was
to
be
vice-president
of
supply
and
chairman
of
its
executive
committee.
turnbow
was
the
--
a
director
of
foremost
and
to
have
the
right
to
nominate
to
other
directors
of
foremost.
turnbow
was
to
be
chairman
of
foremost's
executive
committee.
foremost's
business
was
to
be
divided
into
two
divisions,
an
eastern
division
and
a
western
and
international
division.
the
president
of
foremost
was
to
be
general
manager
of
the
eastern
division
and
turnbow
was
to
be
general
manager
of
the
western
and
international
division.
the
terms
of
this
mandatory
agreement
were
carried
out.
now,
the
mere
recital
of
these
facts
demonstrates
several
things.
first,
there
was
a
very
real
business
purpose
in
the
transaction.
there
was
a
real
reorganization
of
both
companies
in
the
corporate
sense
although
not
in
the
revenue
code
definitional
sense
as
i
shall
come
to
in
a
moment.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
yes.
that
is
true.
it
does
not
meet
the
definition
of
the
reorganization
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
no
party
has
ever
so
contended
and
no
court
in
the
case
has
ever
so
held.
secondly,
these
facts
demonstrate
that
there
was
full
continuity
of
the
business
enterprise.
and
third,
turnbow
continued
to
have
a
very
substantial
equity
interest
or
state
in
that
enterprise.
turnbow,
for
the
taxable
year
in
question,
reported
the
amount
of
cash
received,
$3
million
plus
the
expenses
of
the
transaction
as
capital
gain
and
he
paid
his
tax
thereon.
the
commissioner
determined
that
the
capital
gain
to
be
recognized
for
tax
purposes
was
the
sum
of
the
cash
plus
the
expenses,
plus
the
difference
between
the
value
of
the
foremost
stock
at
the
time
of
the
exchange
and
turnbow's
cost
of
the
supply
stock
which
he
transferred.
turnbow
petitioned
at
the
tax
court
for
redetermination.
the
tax
court
held
that
the
recognized
gain
was
limited
to
the
cash
boot
under
section
112
(c)
(1)
declaring
that
no
reason
appeared
for
departing
from
its
long
established
interpretation
of
that
section.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
holding
for
the
commissioner
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
view
of
the
conflict
of
decisions
with
that
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
howard
versus
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
decided
in
1956
which
accorded
with
the
decision
of
the
tax
court
in
the
case
bonham.
section
112
(c)
(1),
fits
into
an
easily-understood
tax
patent.
generally,
gains
and
losses
from
sales
or
exchanges
are
recognized,
that
is
made
subject
to
appropriate
tax
treatment,
at
the
time
of
the
transaction
under
section
112
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
and
its
predecessors
and
successors,
but
the
congress
made
exceptions
in
the
subsection
immediately
following,
certain
exchanges
solely
in
kind
to
use
the
statutory
phrase
wherein
inappropriate
for
immediate
tax
effect,
that
is
the
gains
and
losses
therefore
were
not
recognized
as
provided
in
section
112
(b).
but
this
did
not
mean
of
course
that
the
exchanges
were
tax
free
or
that
the
participants
escaped
taxation,
the
tax
effects
were
merely
postponed
until
the
taxpayer
made
a
more
radical
change
of
his
property
ownership.
until
then,
he
merely
held
a
paper
profit
or
a
paper
loss,
the
same
as
though
he
continued
to
hold
his
former
property
either
appreciated
in
value
or
depreciated
in
value
as
the
case
might
be.
the
next
three
subsections
of
section
112
dealt
with
exchanges
not
solely
in
kind.
that
is
those
which
would
be
“solely”
in
kind
types
of
exchanges,
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
money
or
other
property
that
is
other
than
the
kinds
described
in
section
112
(b)
and
commonly
called
boot
were
also
received.
section
112
(c)
(1)
provided
that
gain
in
such
a
transaction
should
be
recognized
but
not
in
excess
of
the
amount
of
the
boot.
at
the
same
time,
section
112
(e)
provided
that
loss
in
such
a
transaction
should
not
be
recognized
for
the
obvious
and
expressed
reason
that
otherwise,
it
would
be
too
easy
simply
by
adding
a
dollar
to
an
exchange
or
superficial
exchange
that
is
one
which
left
the
taxpayer
for
all
practical
purposes
still
holding
the
same
investment
in
the
enterprise,
to
transform
paper
loss
into
a
tax
loss.
parenthetically,
i
might
say
here
that
this
couldn't
work
in
the
opposite
direction
under
section
112
(c)
(1).
since
--
if
money
or
other
boot
has
added,
any
gain
would
always
be
immediately
taxed
to
the
full
extent
of
the
added
boot.
the
controversy
here
is
between
what
appears
to
be
the
natural
and
literal
reading
of
section
112
(c)
(1),
one
which
the
tax
court
has
applied
and
declared
for
many
years,
and
which
is
in
the
fullest
harmony
with
the
legislative
policies
in
the
pattern
of
the
tax
law
on
one
end,
and
a
strained
and
unnatural
reading
implicated
by
the
commissioner
which
is
out
of
step
for
these
things,
and
in
particular
opens
up
a
large
“loophole”
for
the
taking
of
paper
losses
as
tax
losses.
in
short,
in
this
case,
the
commissioner
seems
to
be
beating
of
the
little
fire
or
reflection
of
a
fire
in
front
of
him,
or
he's
starting
a
large
fire
in
his
rear.
the
words
of
the
statute,
section
112
(c)
(1)
are
simple
enough.
as
applicable
to
this
case,
it
says,
if
an
exchange
would
be
within
the
provisions
of
subsection
(b)
(3)
as
it
relates
to
this
exchange,
now
these
subsections
are
mentioned.
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that,
the
property
received
in
exchange
consist
not
only
of
property
permitted
by
such
paragraph
to
be
received
without
recognition
of
gain,
but
also
of
other
property
or
money,
then
the
gains
of
the
recipient
shall
be
recognized
within
an
amount
not
in
excess
of
such
money.
and
subsection
(e),
uses
parallel,
identical
language,
really.
it
says,
“if
an
exchange
would
be
within
the
provisions
of
subsections
(b)
(1)
through
(5),
and
here
(b)
(3),
or
with
--
of
this
section,
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
the
property
received
in
exchange
consists
not
only
of
property
permitted
by
such
paragraph
to
be
received
without
the
recognition
of
gain
or
loss,
but
also
other
property
or
money,
then
no
loss
from
the
exchange
shall
be
recognized.”
now
this
language
directs
us
to
section
112
(b)
(3)
which
says,
“no
gain
or
loss
shall
be
recognized
if
stock
or
securities
in
a
corporation,
a
party
to
a
reorganization
are,
in
pursuance
of
the
plan
of
reorganization
exchanged
solely
for
a
stock
or
securities
in
such
corporation
or
in
another
corporation
a
party
to
the
reorganization.”
and
reorganization
is
applicable
here
on
this
“would-be-within”
basis.
it's
defined
in
section
112
(g)
(1)
(b)
and
again
using
“solely”.
and
section
112
(g)
(1)
(b)
starts
as
follows,
the
term
“reorganization”
means
(a)
a
statutory
merger
or
consolidation,
(b)
the
acquisition
by
one
corporation
in
exchange
solely
for
all
or
a
part
of
its
voting
stock
of
at
least
80%
of
the
voting
stock
and
at
least
80%
among
the
total
number
of
shares
of
all
other
classes
of
stock
of
another
corporation,
or
(c)
the
acquisition
by
one
corporation
in
exchange
solely
for
all
of
its
voting
stock
and
essentially
all
the
properties
of
another
corporation,
and
so
forth.
and
by
the
way,
this
lettering
scheme
(a),
(b)
and
(c)
has
given
rise
to
the
practice
of
referring
to
various
transactions
as,
(a)
type
of
reorganizations,
(b)
type
of
reorganizations,
(c)
type
reorganizations,
and
so
forth,
which
will
be
a
convenience
in
this
case.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
no
sir,
it
is
not
a
reorganization,
but
it
is
a
“would-be”
(b)
type
of
reorganization
--
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
--
if
it
weren't
for
the
cash.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
now
one
thing,
it's
beyond
any
possibility
of
dispute
in
this
case.
if
turnbow
had
not
received
any
cash,
the
exchange
would
have
been
solely
for
stock
or
securities
as
specified
in
section
112
(b)
(3).
at
least
80%,
in
fact,
100%
of
the
stock
of
supply
would
have
or
was
transferred
and
solely
voting
stock
of
foremost
would
have
been
received.
therefore,
the
exchange
would
be
within
all
the
provisions
of
section
(b)
(3)
and
none
of
the
gain
would
be
recognizable.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
yes
sir,
because,
if
no
cash
has
been
received,
then,
solely
voting
stock
would
have
been
received
and
it
would
meet
the
definitional
requirements
of
reorganization
in
the
tax
code.
so
it
would
have
met
all
the
requirements
and
there
can
be
no
possible
doubt
of
that.
if
there
had
been
no
cash,
it
would've
met
all
the
requirements
of
solely
stock
or
securities,
solely
voting
stock
and
reorganization
because
they
all
hang
together
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
yes,
that
is
true.
it
would've
been
a
party
of
the
reorganization
in
the
tax
definitional
sense
if
that
fact
--
if
that
had
been
the
actual
fact.
no
cash
received.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
there
would
be
a
problem
of
the
amount
of
stock
received
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
if
the
amount
of
stock
received
were
such
a
sham
or
if
there
was
a
subterfuge
or
if
the
court
could
find
that
there
was
no
real
business
purpose
or
corporate
purpose.
but
where
the
amount
of
stocks
received
is
substantial
and
gives
turnbow
a
substantial
interest
in
the
continuing
enterprise,
then
i
think
we
lose
any
problem
with
mathematics
here.
we
are
simply
to
determine
if
he
did
have
a
substantial
interest
in
this
continuing
enterprise
--
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
no
sir.
i
answered
it
that
it
does
not
come
under
b
because
of
the
cash,
but
it
would
come
under
b
if
the
cash
were
not
there.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
yes
sir.
and
80%
in
fact,
100%
of
the
stock
of
supply
was
transferred.
so,
all
--
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
yes.
that
was
satisfied
anyhow.
in
fact,
we
again
come
to
this
blunt
fact
that
if
it
weren't
for
the
cash,
if
no
cash
were
received,
then
all
of
the
requirements
of
(b)
(3)
would
be
satisfied
and
the
exchange
would
be
totally
tax-deferred.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
totally
tax-deferred.
the
commissioner
himself
readily
agrees
that
the
“if
not”
language
of
section
112
(c)
(1)
removes
the
effect
“solely”
or
perhaps
it's
more
accurate
to
say,
hypothetically
restores
the
“solely”
as
the
word
is
expressed
in
(b)
(3),
but
then
he
says,
he
can
not
retain
this
effect
and
hypothetically
restore
the
“solely”
imported
into
(b)
(3)
in
the
reference
to
reorganization.
in
other
words,
where
(b)
(3)
has
three
requirements,
solely
for
stock
or
securities,
in
a
party
or
reorganization
which
in
this
case
means
--
in
this
context
would
mean
solely
for
voting
stock
and
a
plan
of
reorganization
which
in
this
context
again
would
mean
solely
for
voting
stock.
the
commissioner
freely
admits
that
the
“if
not”
hypothesis
operates
to
restore
the
“solely”
in
the
first
one,
but
then
he
says,
it
denies
that
it
restores
the
“solely”
which
is
repeated
in
the
other
two.
but
still,
i
say,
we
were
faced
with
the
fact
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
cash,
if
no
cash
were
received,
then
all
the
“solely's”
are
satisfied.
the
commissioner
arrives
at
this
position
by
a
curiously
inverted
reasoning
and
it's
all
more
strange
because
in
trying
to
cage
this
mouse,
he's
letting
all
the
animals
escape
under
section
(e).
the
point
he
is
trying
to
reach
is
the
transactions
which
“would-be”
(b)
type
or
(c)
type
reorganizations
but
for
cash
added
can
never
come
under
section
112
(c)
(1).
and
this
is
the
way
he
goes
about
it,
he
said
--
he
says,
let's
first
lay
to
one
side
all
these
--
if
it
“would-be”
if
not
hypothetical
business
and
see
what
we
have
in
fact.
there
was
cash
boot
received
hence,
there
was
no
reorganization,
hence,
there
was
no
property
permitted
to
be
received
without
recognition
of
gain,
hence,
(c)
(1)
can
apply.
but
this
reasoning
doesn't
stand
the
test.
for
example,
consider
a
statutory
merger,
an
(a)
type
reorganization
which
often
includes
cash
as
part
of
the
consideration
along
with
stock,
the
commissioner
concedes
that
such
a
transaction
comes
within
--
comes
in
for
a
limited
recognition
of
gain
under
section
112
(c)
(1),
that
is
if
the
stockholder
taxpayer
would
be
a
subject
to
recognition
of
gain
but
only
to
the
extent
of
the
cash.
but
suppose
we
now
apply
his
reasoning
to
that
situation
as
he
applies
it
in
this
case,
and
by
the
way,
this
is
a
course
of
reasoning
that
appears
to
have
been
developed
for
the
first
time
in
the
brief
filed
in
court.
he
compartmentalizes
the
two
categories
of
property
mentioned
in
(c)
(1)
without
regard
for
each
other.
that
is
first,
property
to
be
permitted
to
be
received
--
a
property
permitted
by
section
(b)
(3)
to
be
received
without
recognition
of
gain,
and
second,
cash.
then
he
says,
without
excluding
the
cash,
see
if
there
is
property
permitted
by
(b)
(3)
to
be
received
without
recognition
of
gain.
now
in
our
merger
situation
--
in
a
merger
situation
i'm
just
postulating,
there
is
stock
plus
cash.
so
to
find
out
if
there
is
property
permitted
by
(b)
(3)
to
be
received
without
recognition
of
gain,
we
turn
to
(b)
(3)
and
that
says,
“if
stock
or
securities
are
exchanged
solely
for
stock
or
securities.”
so
looking
squarely
at
the
cash,
we
cannot
find
that
stock
or
securities
are
exchanged
solely
for
the
stock
or
securities.
so
the
first
compartment
or
category
in
section
(c)
(1)
will
never
be
filled
and
(c)
(1)
can
never
be
fulfilled.
logically,
the
commissioner's
step-by-step
reasoning
was
compartmentalization
and
it
operates
equally
at
all
as
always.
this
shows
to
me
that
this
compartmentation
method
is
all
wrong.
the
two
categories
do
have
regard
for
each
other.
the
cash
doesn't
jump
out
of
the
exchange
to
get
rid
of
part
to
the
effect
of
“solely”
and
then
jump
right
in
--
and
jump
right
back
in
again
so
as
to
bring
“solely”
back
to
life.
this
illustrates
to
our
way
of
thinking
artificial
and
self-contradictory
nature
of
this
argument.
of
course,
in
fact,
“solely”
doesn't
appear
in
(c)
(1)
and
neither
does
“reorganization.”
the
actual
status
inherent
in
those
words
is
not
part
of
(c)
(1)
which
hypothesizes
a
contrary
status
by
the
“if
not.”
all
along,
congress
has
made
it
clear
that
as
to
a
stock
for
stock
exchange,
or
a
merger,
or
substantially
all
the
corporate
assets
for
stock,
or
recapitalization,
when
the
business
enterprise
is
continued
and
when
to
the
extent
that
the
investors'
interest
in
the
enterprise
is
continued,
in
other
words,
foremost
property
loss
is
rather
a
paper
profit
or
loss
in
the
continuing
business
enterprise
than
a
real
property
loss
in
the
terminal
transaction.
then,
in
order
not
to
hamper
legitimate
business
adjustments,
congress
is
satisfied
to
defer
present
tax
effects
and
require
a
tax
accounting
later
when
the
taxpayer
has
made
some
sort
of
a
terminal
transaction.
but,
when
cash
or
other
property
outside
the
continuing
enterprises
added
to
the
consideration,
congress
will
immediately
tax
any
gain
to
the
extent
of
the
boot.
but
not
to
any
greater
extent
lest
it
(inaudible)
the
policy
stated
just
before.
the
laws
of
the
legislative
policies
and
the
congressional
pattern,
a
longstanding
and
clearly
understood
by
the
congress,
and
they
are
fully
satisfied
in
this
case
by
taxing
turnbow
on
his
gain
to
the
full
extent
of
the
cash
received
as
has
been
done
in
deferring
the
tax
as
to
a
stock
interest
in
the
enterprise
until
he
has
made
some
final
disposition
of
it
as
the
tax
court
held.
when
congress
has
made
it
clear
that
when
a
shareholder
exchanges
his
voting
stock
in
one
corporation
or
voting
stock
in
another
and
there
are
in
fact
an
honest
business
purpose,
a
continuation
of
the
business
enterprise
and
a
continuing
substantial
interest
of
the
shareholder
in
that
enterprise,
the
time
is
not
then
appropriate
for
a
tax
accounting,
the
tax
reckoning
on
the
stock
received
in
the
transaction.
and
when
as
i
say
congress
has
made
that
clear,
then
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
that
time
is
anymore
appropriate
as
to
the
stock
simply
because
the
shareholder
has
received
a
dollar
in
addition
and
pays
his
tax
on
the
dollar
immediately.
that
is
what
section
112
(c)
(1)
takes
care
of
and
that
is
the
case
here.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
i
believe
so
mr.
justice
harlan,
because
in
the
howard
case
for
example,
the
commissioner
was
apparently
urging
that
section
112
(c)
(1)
apply,
so
as
to
tax
--
to
lay
a
tax
on
the
amount
of
cash
and
a
promise
to
pay
preferred
stock
in
that
case,
and
the
commissioner
was
on
the
other
side
of
that
case.
now
that
case
turned
also
upon
the
question
of
whether
the
transactions
preferred
by
stockholders
exchange
their
stock,
should
all
be
taken
together
or
whether
they
were
separable.
nevertheless,
the
commissioner
was
apparently
advocating
the
application
of
(c)
(1)
in
that
case.
more
than
that,
however,
the
fact
is
so
important
that
the
tax
court
ever
since
1934,
the
tax
court
of
16
expert
tax
judges
has
been
applying
this
interpretation
as
natural
interpretation
of
section
112
(c)
(1)
and
is
applied
originally
in
the
bruce
case,
and
the
bonham
case,
and
the
love
case,
that's
all
going
on
without
change.
the
taxpayer
--
the
tax
court
would
never
have
any
division
of
opinion
and
never
deviated
from
that
method
of
interpretation
which
is
simply
as
the
taxpayer
says
in
this
case,
eliminate
the
cash
and
then
see
what
you
have
here.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
yes
sir.
the
opening
brief
and
they're
also
dealt
within
our
reply
brief.
so
in
the
light
of
that
long
standing
rule
of
interpretation
of
the
tax
court
which
apparently
has
been
the
decided
law
until
for
the
first
time,
our
court
went
the
other
way,
when
the
ninth
circuit
court
reversed
the
tax
court
in
this
case.
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
there
hasn't
been
some
really
extreme
change
of
the
view
of
the
law.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
no
i
understand
that,
i've
never
been
able
to
find
any
other
deviation
in
the
court.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
no
sir.
it
does
not.
the
whole
pattern
of
this
section
112
(c)
(1)
is
a
hypothetical
contrary
to
facts
basis
and
that's
the
way
it
has
always
been
applied
and
looked
at.
it
is
the
very
idea
--
it
would
be
--
if
not
--
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
implies
a
contrary
to
facts,
so
we
don't
look
at
the
actual
effect,
we
look
at
the
situation
as
it
would
be
if
you've
eliminated
the
cash.
and
that
has
been
the
whole
pattern
ever
since
these
provisions
were
put
in
the
law
back
in
1924
and
1923.
now,
may
i
--
may
i
just
add
to
that
this
very
fact,
if
it
weren't
for
the
fact
that
cash
was
received,
then
again,
we
get
to
the
situation
where
all
the
requirements
including
reorganization,
including
solely
for
voting
stock
are
met.
they're
all
there.
so,
you
have
your
basic
pattern
and
then
when
you
have
your
cash
added,
the
congress
simply
says,
well,
“we
aren't
going
to
--
we
aren't
going
to
let
the
taxpayers
escape
taxation
on
any
gain
to
the
extent
of
the
boot,
but
we're
still
going
to
defer
his
tax
to
the
extent
of
the
stock
in
this
bona
fide
business
readjustments
until
he
makes
some
more
terminal
disposition
of
it.”
it
still
gets
back
to
the
undoubted
fact
that
without
the
cash,
all
of
the
requirements
of
these
three
are
met.
all
the
“solely's”
are
met.
reorganization
is
met.
it
would
then
be
a
reorganization,
it
would
be
within
the
terms
of
section
112
(b)
(3),
and
it
is
not
simply
because
there
is
cash
added
but
as
to
the
cash,
the
taxpayer
has
been
taxed,
he's
paid
his
tax
and
that
part
of
it
is
closed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
the
reply
if
the
court
please.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
in
this
very
few
minutes,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
should
like
to
make
these
two
points.
the
solicitor
general
has
remarked
this
morning
that
in
the
1934
committee
reports,
both
house
and
senate
agreed
that
there
shouldn't
be
any
entitlement
to
nonrecognition
of
gain
even
in
part
of
this
kind
of
transaction.
reading
the
house
and
senate
committee
reports,
they
make
no
reference
to
the
impart
situations
whatsoever
that
i
can
find.
there
was
reference
to
the
situations
where
a
total
nonrecognition
of
gain
or
loss
was
involved
and
that
is
all.
the
--
there
was
never
any
reference
to
the
boot
provisions
which
presumably
acted
as
they
always
have
by
taking
care
of
any
boot
added
--
by
nonrecognition
or
deferment
of
the
gain
or
loss,
whatever
it
might
be
until
there
was
a
more
terminal
transaction.
on
this
question
of
the
fact
--
on
the
revenue
which
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
yesterday
and
which
the
solicitor
general
answered
by
referring
to
the
base
provisions,
there
are
several
answers.
in
the
first
place
as
to
this
type
of
transaction,
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
government
gets
all
its
tax.
turnbow
has
already
paid
his
tax
on
the
$3
million
in
cash
and
as
soon
as
he
makes
some
terminal
transaction
affecting
his
stock
interest
in
the
continuing
enterprise,
then
the
government
will
get
its
tax
on
any
gain
resulting
there
from.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
it
is
--
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
no,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
it
will
not,
it
will
be
the
cost
basis
of
the
shares
which
he
transferred.
and
therefore,
all
of
his
gain
which
is
in
court
at
this
moment
in
his
stock
interest
in
the
continuing
enterprise
will
be
subject
to
tax
as
soon
as
he
makes
a
more
terminal
disposition
of
his
stock
interest
in
the
continuing
enterprise.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
he
is
talking
about
the
basis
for
the
acquiring
corporation
which
is
an
entirely
different
proposition
and
is
not
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
there
may
be
a
stepped
up
basis
or
a
stepped
down
basis
as
the
case
may
be.
in
the
south
--
helvering
versus
southwest
case
for
instance,
there
was
a
very
greatly
stepped
down
basis.
i
think
the
--
the
assets
have
gone
from
a
cost
basis
of
something
like
$9
million
down
to
something
like
$700,000.
but
in
--
that
is
a
different
kind
of
a
question
because
the
problem
that
we
have
is
the
gain
or
the
loss
for
the
particular
tax
there
transferor
and
that
is
what
is
covered
in
section
112
(c)
(1)
and
not
anything
else.
also,
it
has
been
showed
in
our
brief,
that
basis
is
not
irretrievably
with
it.
that
is
the
basis
of
the
corporation.
it's
not
irretrievably
wedded
to
the
basis
for
the
transferring
shareholder
which
is
the
question
here
and
the
only
question
here.
and
so
far
as
that
is
concerned,
there
is
no
question
because
the
shareholder
retains
his
old
basis
for
the
property
transferred,
and
all
of
his
gain,
ultimately
a
subject
to
tax
when
this
(inaudible)
gain
or
paper
profit
has
turned
in
to
an
actually
realized
profit
as
the
case
maybe
or
a
loss.
pardon
--
mr.
francis
n.
marshall
that
is
another
situation
mr.
justice
whittaker.
that
is
a
problem
that
runs
through
the
whole
tax
law
and
affects
anybody
and
everybody
and
it
affects
of
course
a
man
who
simply
holds
the
same
property,
appreciated
or
depreciated
as
the
case
maybe
or
who
holds
an
exchanged
stock
interest
in
the
continuing
enterprise
which
however
doesn't
change
the
actual
interest
in
the
enterprise
anymore
than
in
form.
therefore,
that
is
a
side
issue
that
runs
through
the
whole
tax
law
and
doesn't
affect
this
particular
problem.
i
think
the
answer
really
is
that
the
matter
always
works
in
both
directions
so
the
effect
on
the
revenue
is
up
or
down
as
the
case
maybe.
may
i
have
just
one
moment
please
mr.
chief
justice?
