brennan,
jr.
mr.
barnett,
this
may
not
be
too
relevant,
but
i'm
just
curious.
in
terms
of
the
revenue
whichever
way
this
comes
out,
does
it
matter
too
much?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
is
that
established
or
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
what
i
meant
was
the
federal
--
this
will
adjudicate
this
consequence
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
depreciation
only
or
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
the
new
basis
would
be
significant
appreciation
and
ultimate
sale?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
marshall
i
thought
mr.
barnett
took
the
different
position
as
to
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
agree
with
him
that
the
acquiring
corporation
does
acquire
different
places
for
appreciation
and
so
forth?
