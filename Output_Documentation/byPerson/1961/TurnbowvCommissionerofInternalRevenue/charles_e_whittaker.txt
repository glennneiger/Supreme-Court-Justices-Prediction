justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
concede
that
that
is
so,
that
there
is
no
reorganization
in
the
internal
revenue
sense.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
it
be
--
would
it
be
planning
--
maybe
i'll
just
ask
you
for
information
now,
112
(b)
(3)
says,
“no
gain
or
loss
shall
be
recognized
if
stock
or
securities
in
a
corporation
a
party
to
a
reorganization
are,”
and
so
forth.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
marshall,
the
words
of
how
you
described
(c)
(1)
pretty
clearly
fits
your
situation,
but
it
still
leaves
me
doubtful
about
the
meaning
of
this
word
“reorganization”
in
the
112
(b)
(3),
through,
if
--
as
how
you
developed
the
concept,
an
exchange
would
be
within
the
provisions
of
(b)
(3)
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact,
that
property
received
in
exchange
consisted
not
only
of
the
stock,
but
also
of
money,
then
the
gain,
if
any,
to
the
recipient
shall
be
recognized,
but
in
an
amount
not
in
excess
of
the
money,
yet
this
seemed
to
contem
--
it
contemplates
that
they're,
in
truth,
a
reorganization?
