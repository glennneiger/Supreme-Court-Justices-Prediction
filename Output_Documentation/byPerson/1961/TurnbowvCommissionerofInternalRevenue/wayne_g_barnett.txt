mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
first
like
to
correct
a
couple
of
matters
as
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
about
our
prior
position.
the
government
has
never
maintained
any
other
position
with
the
position
we
are
maintaining
now.
we
do
not
maintain
the
opposite
position
in
howard,
as
to
prior
decisions,
the
long
line
of
tax
court
decisions
to
which
the
petitioner
refers,
i
think
we
found
to
be
nonexistent.
just
through,
in
the
bonham
case
decided
in
1936,
under
the
revenue
act
of
1928,
there
is
a
reference
and
statement
of
the
question,
assuming
the
absence
of
the
cash
before
going
to
the
reorganization
definition.
but
the
reorganization
definition
under
the
1928
act
did
not
contain
the
solely
for
voting
stock
requirement
and
i
hope
to
show
that's
the
very
reason
that
requirement
is
added
was
to
prevent
qualification
of
this
very
kind
of
transaction.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
matters
a
great
deal,
primarily
as
i
will
try
to
show
in
the
interaction
with
the
basis
provisions.
i'll
have
to
develop
something
before
i
get
to
that,
but
i
think
i
could
(inaudible).
i
would
like
to
start
just
by
trying
to
simplify
and
clarify
the
structure
of
the
reorganization
provisions,
see
what
the
definition
is
there
for,
and
what
it
is
meant,
what
function
it's
meant
to
serve.
section
112
(g)
(1)
is
purely
definitional.
it
simply
says
which
transactions
are
reorganizations
and
which
are
not.
it
doesn't
prescribe
the
consequences,
the
consequences
that
qualify
as
reorganization
are
specified
elsewhere
and
they
are
two
in
number.
the
primary
one
is
that
described
by
section
112
(b)
(3)
and
(c)
(1).
that
is,
if
there
is
reorganization,
then
exchanges
in
pursuant
of
the
--
pursuance
of
the
plan
of
reorganization
are
tax-free
except
to
the
extent
of
boot,
i.e.
the
gains
or
losses
not
recognized
except
for
any
boot
received.
i
might
note
that
the
result
that
the
petitioners
contend
for
here
is
precisely
the
result
that
would
obtain
if
it
were
reorganizations.
so
this
argument
means
that
not
being
a
reorganization
has
no
effect
upon
the
recognition
for
gain.
the
other
consequences
of
being
a
reorganization
is
that
prescribed
in
the
basis
provisions,
the
provisions
governing
the
basis
of
property
for
purposes
of
depreciation
and
determining
gain
or
loss
on
subsequent
sale.
section
113
(a)
(7)
provides
that
if
a
corporation
acquires
property,
here
that
would
be
the
foremost
corporation,
the
acquiring
corporation,
acquires
property
in
a
reorganization.
it
does
not
get
a
new
cost
basis
for
the
property
unless
it
rather
takeover
the
basis
that
the
property
had
in
the
hands
of
the
transferor.
now,
those
are
the
only
two
consequences
for
reorganizations.
they
are
specified
in
the
1939
code,
that
is
nonrecognition
of
gain
to
the
transferor
and
carryover
the
basis
to
the
transferee.
now,
from
those
consequences,
i
think
the
basic
notion
of
what
a
reorganization
is
becomes
clear.
the
definition
simply
describe
transactions
on
which
congress
has
deemed
there
is
not
a
sufficient
change
in
the
nature
of
the
underlying
property
and
the
interest
in
it
to
justify
a
reckoning
up
of
gain
or
loss
to
the
transferor
or
the
creation
of
the
new
basis
to
the
transferee.
the
enterprise
ought
to
continue
on
and
the
tax
status
quo
should
be
maintained.
but
what
that
means
is
that
the
definition
of
a
reorganization
has
as
its
very
purpose
the
specification
of
the
kinds
of
transactions
in
which
the
exchanges
would
be
subject
to
the
nonrecognition
provision.
that's
its
only
purpose
in
as
much
as
the
basis
carryover
is
really
a
corollary
to
the
nonrecognition
of
gain.
now,
in
this
case,
as
i
say,
the
word
“reorganization,”
the
gain
would
be
taxable
only
to
the
extent
of
the
cash
which
is
the
result
to
which
the
petitioner
contends.
but
it's
admitted
that
there
is
not
a
reorganization
in
this
case
because
he
failed
to
satisfy
the
solely
for
voting
stock
requirement
in
the
definition
of
a
reorganization,
the
“would-be”
definition.
but
he
says,
it
makes
no
difference,
the
result
is
the
same
as
though
that
requirement
were
not
there.
now
i
think
a
complete
answer
is
that
his
argument
destroys
any
purpose
to
solely
for
voting
stock
requirement.
it
has
no
consonance.
now,
i
shouldn't
say
that
it
destroys
it
because
his
argument,
under
his
argument,
while
the
failure
to
satisfy
the
solely
for
voting
stock
requirement
doesn't
have
any
effect
upon
his
recognition
of
gain.
it
does
control
the
basis
consequence
to
the
transferee
in
this
case,
because
there
was
in
fact,
no
reorganization.
the
basis
carryover
provisions
does
not
apply
and
foremost
gets
instead
of
the
petitioner's
low
basis
for
the
supply
stock
that
it
had,
a
stepped-up
fair
market
value
basis
of
the
stock.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
there's
no
question
about
it.
section
113
(a)
(7)
says
the
basis
of
property
shall
be
cost
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
most
--
a
large
number
of
the
reorganization
cases,
helvering
v.
southwest
consolidated
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
a
basis
case.
and
it
goes
on
the
question
whether
or
not
it
is
a
reorganization.
a
lot
of
the
litigation
has
been
over
the
basis
consequence
rather
than
the
nonrecognition
of
gain
consequence
and
that's
always
implicit
in
those
cases.
now,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
what
that
means.
consider
a
corporation
that
has
assets,
business
assets
with
the
high
value
but
a
low
basis.
it
transfers
those
assets
to
a
new
corporation.
if
it
does
so,
solely
for
voting
stock,
it
is
a
(c)
reorganization.
the
transferor
corporation
recognizes
no
gain
but
also,
the
transferee
corporation
has
to
takeover
the
low
basis.
now,
on
the
petitioner's
view,
all
the
parties
need
to
do
is
add
a
little
cash
to
the
consideration
for
the
assets
and
the
results
would
be
that
the
transferor
corporation
still
doesn't
recognize
the
gain
except
for
the
nominal
amount
of
cash
itself,
but
the
transferee
corporation,
it's
a
brand
new
stepped-up
fair
market
value
basis
for
appreciation.
and
it's
that
consequence
of
petitioner's
argument
that
makes
the
case
so
important.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
also
on
the
case
of
stock
would
be
only
for
a
purpose
of
subsequent
sale
and
it's
that
consequence
that
makes
the
question
so
important.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
ultimately,
i
think
that
would
probably
be
right.
the
--
now,
i
think
simply
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
the
consequences
of
the
argument
upon
the
solely
for
voting
stock
requirement
even
there
was
no
--
no
understandable
purpose
at
all,
shows
the
policy
in
petitioner's
argument.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct,
in
a
case
in
which
the
property
has
a
high
basis
and
a
low
value,
not
the
--
in
that
case,
the
parties
would
not
put
in
the
nominal
cash
and
make
it
qualified
as
a
reorganization.
now,
i
would
like
briefly
to
say
that
the
history
of
the
solely
for
voting
stock
requirement
of
the
(b)
definition,
it
was
added
in
the
revenue
act
of
1934.
before
the
revenue
act
of
1934,
the
definition
of
assets
for
stock
acquisition
reorganization
is
open-ended.
literally,
it
only
requires
that
the
acquiring
corporation
acquire
substantially
all
the
properties
of
the
other
corporation
or
the
majority
of
the
stock.
it
did
not
say
anything
about
what
was
given
in
exchange.
but
the
treasury
argues
that
the
underlying
presuppositions
to
reorganization
definitions
require
that
the
transaction
partake
of
the
nature
of
a
merger
in
consolidation,
and
where
a
large
part
of
the
consideration
was
in
form
of
cash
or
short-term
notes.
it
did
not
have
that
nature
and
should
not
be
held
that
the
reorganization
was
more
like
a
sale.
those
are
the
terms
in
which
the
argument
is
cast.
that
argument
proved
only
partly
successful.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
tried
to
show
that
the
very
function
of
the
reorganization
definition
was
to
trigger
the
operation
of
the
nonrecognition
provisions.
and
as
to
the
petitioner's
argument,
the
boot
provision
permits
the
nonrecognition
of
gain
whether
or
not
there's
reorganization,
would
deprive
the
definitions
of
the
only
function
they
have.
i'd
like
to
turn
the
now
to
what
started
yesterday
to
the
history
of
the
solely
for
voting
stock
limitation
of
the
b
and
c
definitions.
those
were
added
in
1934.
before
that,
the
definitions
were
as
they
are
set
forth
at
page
61
of
our
brief
and
you
will
see
that,
what
is
now
the
a,
b
and
c
definitions
were
lumped
together
in
a
single
clause,
that
defined
as
a
reorganization,
a
merger
or
consolidation
and
then
(including
the
acquisition
by
one
corporation
of
at
least
a
majority
of
the
stock
or
substantially
all
the
assets
of
another).
now
that
parenthetical
clause
did
not
impose
any
limitation
upon
the
property
given
in
exchange
for
the
acquisition.
however,
because
it
modified
the
merger
or
consolidation,
the
government
argued
that
it
was
meant
to
include
only
those
transactions
that
were
in
practical
effect
essentially
of
the
same
nature
as
a
merger
or
consolidation,
and
therefore,
if
any
substantial
part
of
the
consideration
was
cash
or
short-term
notes
instead
of
the
continuing
interest,
that
was
in
practical
effect
a
sale
rather
than
a
merger
or
consolidation
and
not
covered.
now,
that
argument
was
successful
only
in
part
and
in
a
line
of
cases
which
culminated
in
a
group
of
decisions
by
this
court
in
296
u.s.
the
leading
one
which
is
helvering
against
minnesota
tea.
it
was
held
that
it
was
sufficient
to
qualify
as
reorganization
if
a
substantial
and
material
part
of
the
consideration
was
voting
stock
or
common
stock,
a
continuing
interest
of
the
enterprise,
even
though
the
rest
of
the
consideration
in
the
very
large
part
was
cash
and
in
fact,
the
minnesota
tea
that
was
held
to
be
a
reorganization
even
though
almost
50%
of
the
consideration
was
cash
and
therefore,
the
consequence
was
that
the
gain
was
recognizable
only
to
the
extent
of
the
cash
rather
than
as
the
government
argued
the
whole
gain
being
recognized.
now,
this
case,
the
transaction
in
this
case
is
a
blood-brother
to
minnesota,
the
transaction
in
minnesota
tea.
it's
in
fact
a
little
more
extreme
because
here,
over
70%
of
the
consideration
was
cash.
nevertheless,
under
the
pre-1934
act
under
the
rationale
of
minnesota
tea,
the
transaction
here
would
have
qualified
as
a
reorganization
with
the
consequence
that
the
gain
would
have
been
recognized
only
to
the
extent
of
the
cash.
now,
it
was
against
the
background
of
that
litigation
and
the
asserted
sale
reorganization
dichotomy
that
the
1934
act
was
inactive.
the
house
committee
about
the
prude
of
decisions
holding
the
transactions
to
be
reorganizations
where
no
money
passes
said
that
when
it
called
the
stoop
lawyers
had
been
successful
in
arranging
what
were
in
fact
sales
in
the
form
of
reorganizations
and
to
present
that,
it
recommended
eliminating
entirely
whether
or
not
the
b
and
c
definitions
and
restricting
the
statute
to
statutory
mergers
and
consolidations.
the
senate
committee,
although
agreeing
with
the
purposes
of
the
house
and
the
need
to
prevent
sales
from
qualifying
as
reorganizations,
pointed
out
that
a
lot
of
states
did
not
have
statutory
provisions
permitting
mergers
and
consolidations
and
that
no
states,
it
was
necessary
to
have
some
other
mechanism
to
achieve
necessary
business
readjustments
without
the
incident
attacks.
accordingly,
to
permit
that
while
at
the
same
time
preventing
sales
from
qualifying
as
reorganizations,
it
recommended
putting
back
the
b
and
c
definitions,
but
limiting
them
to
transactions
in
exchange
solely
for
voting
stock.
in
the
senate
committee's
view,
if
it
was
solely
for
voting
stock,
it
should
be
like
in
the
mergers
and
consolidations.
if,
however,
there
was
anything
but
voting
stock,
it
should
be
classified
as
a
sale
and
for
the
very
purpose
of
requiring
that
the
entire
gain
not
simply
the
cash
which
is
always
taxable
to
require
the
entire
gain
be
taxable.
now,
this
transaction
which
would've
been
a
reorganization
before
the
1934
act
and
therefore,
taxable
only
to
the
extent
(inaudible),
admittedly
which
it
has
to
admit
is
no
longer
a
reorganization
because
of
that
change.
the
anomaly
is
that
he
goes
on
to
argue
that
it
makes
no
difference
and
that
his
gain
is
taxable
precisely
as
it
would've
been
before
congress
added
that
limitation
and
he
argues
that,
even
though
this
transaction
in
an
aggravated
form
is
the
very
kind
of
transaction,
the
congress,
both
the
house
and
senate
agree
to
not
be
entire
to
the
benefits
of
nonrecognition
even
in
part.
now,
there's
also
one
subsequent
that
--
of
legislative
history
after
the
years
in
question
here
that
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention.
under
the
1939
code,
assets
and
acquisitions,
noted
under
the
c
definition,
had
to
be
solely
for
voting
stock
to
qualify
as
a
reorganization.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
when
c
would
cover?
i
mean
b
or
c
definitions?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
would
cover
--
it
would've
covered
this
case
if
all
that
he
had
received
have
been
voting
stock
and
that's
all
that
it
does
cover.
if
your
question
is
directed
towards
whether
there
can
ever
be
boot
in
a
b
or
c
reorganization,
i
would
like
to
say
that
isn't
open
question.
there
are
several
questions
and
interpretation
left
on
that
issue.
the
howard
case
itself
involved
the
transaction
that
quite
arguably
was
a
reorganization,
you
will
know
that
b
requires
only
that
80%,
at
least
80%
of
the
stock
of
the
acquired
corporation
be
acquired.
it's
therefore
arguable
that
if
you
acquire
at
least
80%
solely
for
voting
stock,
then
even
though
you
pay
cash
for
the
rest,
it
would
still
be
a
b
reorganization.
that
was
the
fact
in
howard
case.
there's
81%
of
the
stock
was
acquired
for
voting
stock
and
19%
for
cash.
the
seventh
circuit,
in
fact,
held
that
the
cash
aided
the
sitting
minority,
prevented
the
b
reorganization.
that's
the
only
decision
--
that
is
not
a
decision,
a
reduction
i
believe,
but
that
is
really
still
an
open
question
and
i
think
it's
a
very
good
argument
and
likely
to
have
argument
that
if
you
--
if
80%
of
the
stock
is
acquired
for
voting
stock,
the
fact
that
an
additional
--
a
necessarily
additional
amount
of
stock
is
acquired
for
cash
whatnot
disqualified.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
question
is
what
has
to
be
acquired
solely
for
voting
stock?
since,
all
you
have
to
acquire
to
be
a
reorganization
is
80%
of
the
stock
of
the
acquired
corporation.
if
you
acquire
that
much
solely
for
voting
stock,
the
argument
is,
why
should
it
make
any
difference
that
you
go
on
to
acquire
some
additional
stock
for
cash?
why
should
that
disqualify
what
otherwise
would've
(voice
overlap)
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
not
arguing
that.
i'm
only
saying
that
there
is
still
an
open
question.
it
has
never
been
precisely
resolved
in
the
assets
acquisition,
this
court's
decision
in
southwest
consolidated
in
315
u.s.
seems
pretty
conclusively
to
mean
to
say
that
there
can't
be
anything
at
all
besides
voting
stock.
but
those
definitions
were
changed
after
the
boot
provision
got
to
its
present
form.
the
boot
reasons
that
i'm
willing
to
show
is
simply
a
standard
mechanical
rule
and
the
reorganization
definitions
are
the
instrument
of
policy.
it's
by
them
that
the
congress
has
been
time
to
time
changed
its
mind
about
what
kinds
of
transactions
ought
to
qualify
for
nonrecognition
even
in
part.
now
i
think
the
history
that
if
it's
foretold
will
answer.
the
requirement
and
assets
acquisition
of
the
exchange
--
the
acquisition
would
be
solely
for
voting
stock
was
found
to
be
too
harsh.
in
the
1954
code
it
was
relaxed.
the
c
definition
in
the
1954
code
requires
only
that
at
least
80%
of
the
consideration
be
voting
stock
and
the
addition
--
and
the
rest
of
the
consideration
up
to
20%
can
be
cash
or
other
property
and
still
qualify
as
reorganization.
i
would
like
to
give
you,
read
to
you
the
senate
committee's
explanation
of
the
reason
for
that
change.
unfortunately,
this
isn't
cited
in
our
brief.
i
have
only
discovered
it
and
so
i
would
like
to
read
to
you
the
actual
text.
the
senate
committee
said
this,
“under
present
law,”
that's
1939
code,
“if
one
corporation
acquires
substantially
all
the
assets
of
another,
the
acquisition
must
be
made
entirely
for
voting
stock
or
the
transaction
will
not
be
subject
to
the
nonrecognition
rules
to
any
extent.”
that
is
to
say,
the
committee
reports
says
that
a
failure
to
meet
solely
for
voting
stock
requirement,
doesn't
simply
bar
characterization
as
reorganization
in
the
abstract.
it
bars
the
applications
of
the
nonrecognition
rules
that
is
(c)
(1),
the
boot
provision
to
any
extent
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
reason
making
the
change
is
so
that
you
can't
have
some
cash
and
still
be
entitled
to
partial
recognition.
the
statement
by
the
senate
committee
is
a
direct
and
explicit
answer
to
the
very
argument
made
by
the
petitioner
here.
petitioners
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
1954
code.
it's
the
senate
report
1622,
the
83rd
congress
second
session,
page
263.
now,
having
shown,
i
hope
that
the
petitioner's
construction
of
the
boot
provision
will
make
a
shambles
of
the
reorganization
definitions
and
the
functions
they
serve.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
boot
provision
itself
to
show
that
the
interpretation
producing
those
results
is
in
fact
not
even
colorable.
the
--
we
have
to
start
with
(b)
(3)
because
we
are
talking
about
the
interaction
of
(c)
(1)
with
(b)
(3).
section
(b)
(3)
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
15.
it
says,
that
no
gain
or
loss
shall
be
recognized
if
stock
or
securities
in
a
party
to
a
reorganization
are
exchanged
pursuant
to
the
plan
of
reorganization
solely
for
stock
or
securities
in
another
party
to
the
reorganization.
now,
as
you
point
out
on
page,
the
following
page,
page
16,
there
are
in
fact
four
requirements
to
be
under
(b)
(3);
(b)
(3)
is
the
basic
nonrecognition
provision.
the
first
requirement
is
that
the
exchange
be
pursuant
to
a
reorganization.
the
second
is
that
the
taxpayer,
the
stockholder
whose
exchange
is
involved,
transfers
stock
or
securities
in
the
party
through
reorganization.
the
third
requirement
is
that
he
receive
stock
or
securities
in
a
party
to
the
reorganization.
and
the
forth
requirement
is
that
he
receive
solely
such
stock
or
securities.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
first
three
requirements
are
all
satisfied
as
they
may
be
in
many
types
of
reorganization,
there
is
a
reorganization,
the
exchange
of
stock
or
securities
in
a
party
for
reorganization
and
he
receives
stock
or
securities
in
a
party
to
reorganization,
even
though,
those
are
satisfied,
if
he
receives
not
only
the
property
permitted
by
that
section
to
be
received
which
is
stock
in
a
party
through
reorganization,
but
also
other
property,
he
does
not
--
his
exchange
is
not
qualify
because
that
fourth
requirement
that
he
receive
solely
qualifying
property.
now,
with
all
that,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
boot
provision
itself,
section
(c)
(1),
and
that
is
set
forth
on
page
22
of
our
brief.
it's
a
very
--
a
difficult
section
to
read.
it
has
a
lot
of
negatives
and
one
has
to
read
it
very
carefully.
what
it
says
is,
if
an
exchange
would
be
within
(b)
(3),
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
the
property
received
in
exchange
consists
not
only
of
property
permitted
by
(b)
(3)
to
be
received
without
the
recognition
of
gain,
but
also
of
other
property.
then
gain
is
recognized
only
to
the
extent
of
the
other
property.
now
what
i
mean
to
show
is
that
that
is
expressly
in
reference
to
a
failure
to
satisfy
the
fourth
requirement
as
i
set
them
out,
the
basic
nonrecognition
provision.
now
i
think
that
can
be
seen
more
clearly
from
this
schematic
restatement
of
(c)
(1)
at
the
bottom
of
page
22.
we
have
set
it
forth
there
and
attempt
to
separate
the
various
steps.
and
what
it
sets
effectively,
this
is
our
recasting
of
it,
so
you
can
see
the
steps,
if
in
an
exchange
there
is
received
both
one
property
permitted
by
(b)
(3)
to
be
received
without
the
recognition
of
gain
and
to
other
property,
and
the
next
step,
if
the
exchange
would
be
within
(b)
(3)
if
only
the
permitted
property
had
been
received,
the
gain
is
taxed
to
the
extent
of
the
other
property.
now,
the
first
step
before
you
reach
the
hypothetical
question,
the
‘would
be'
question,
is
to
satisfy
that
requirement
that
some
of
the
property
received
be
property
permitted
by
(b)
(3)
to
be
received
without
the
recognition
of
gain.
you
have
to
have
some
property
independently
qualifying
under
(b)
(3)
before
you
reach
(c)
(1),
it
says
that
expressly.
now
the
only
property
permitted
by
(b)
(3)
to
be
received
without
the
recognition
of
gain
is
stock
or
securities
in
a
party
to
a
reorganization.
here,
there
was
no
reorganization,
foremost
is
not
a
party
to
reorganization
and
the
stock
in
foremost
was
not
stock
in
a
party
to
a
reorganization.
the
taxpayer
here
received
nothing
qualifying
under
(b)
(3).
none
of
his
property
was
property
permitted
by
(b)
(3)
to
be
received
without
the
recognition
of
gain.
it
was
all
other
property.
everything
he
got
was
boot
in
the
dichotomy
established
by
(c)
(1).
you'll
never
reach
the
hypothetical
question
whether
if
he'd
received
only
the
permitted
property,
it
would've
been
under
(b)
(3).
i
think
if
we
follow
through
the
statute,
i
realize
it's
a
very
difficult
thing
to
follow,
if
you
follow
through
this
page,
i
think
you
will
find
that
it
is
impossible
to
read
the
statute
the
way
the
petitioner
reads
it.
there's
one
other
independent
objection
in
the
petitioner's
reading
which
i
briefly
like
to
suggest
whether
it's
the
reorganization
definitions
themselves
talk
about
the
whole
transaction
which
normally
involves
a
lot
of
exchanges.
the
(b)
(3)
and
(c)
(1)
talk
about
the
individual
exchanges
pursuant
to
the
whole
plan
and
it
deals
specifically
with
each
individual
exchange
separately.
therefore,
(c)
(1)
when
it
talks
about
the
property
received
in
exchange
is
talking
only
about
the
property
received
in
exchange
by
the
single
stockholder
in
his
exchange.
it
doesn't
say
a
word
about
what
was
received
by
other
stockholders
in
other
exchanges.
now,
in
most
of
these
cases,
this
case
is
atypical
because
there's
only
one
stockholder,
in
most
cases
there
are
a
lot
stockholders
and
to
any
boot,
a
lot
of
stockholders
receive
part
of
it
if
there's
any
cash.
and
that
was
true
in
the
howard
case,
in
the
howard
case,
the
taxpayer,
howard,
had
in
fact
himself
received
only
voting
stock,
he
didn't
receive
any
cash.
another
stockholder
had
received
cash,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
howard
said,
that
under
(c)
(1),
he
could
assume
a
way,
the
cash
received
by
the
other
stockholder
in
order
hypothetically
to
qualify
as
a
reorganization
and
that
is
an
impossible
reading
of
(c)
(1).
it
talks
about,
only
about,
what
the
individual
stockholder
receives
in
his
exchange.
and
you
just
cannot
read
it
to
permit
you
to
assume
that
other
stockholders
didn't
receive
something
in
order,
hypothetically,
to
qualify
as
a
reorganization.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
last
argument
i
think,
is
a
red
herring.
first
of
all,
it's
always
been
true
that
by
not
being
a
reorganization,
you
can
avoid
the
nonrecognition
provisions
and
take
loss
and
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
congress
has
ever
attempted
to
avoid
that
consequence.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
answer
that
is
suggested
by
justice
stewart
yesterday,
if
you
avoid
being
in
a
reorganization
in
order
to
take
a
loss,
the
acquiring
corporation
gets
a
reduced
basis.
in
a
loss
situation,
you
have
a
high
basis
and
the
acquiring
corporation
would
normally
like
to
take
over
your
high
basis
for
depreciation
purposes
in
a
c
type
of
reorganization.
if
you
avoid
qualifying
as
a
reorganization
so
that
you
take
a
loss,
the
consequence
is
that
the
acquiring
corporation
has
to
take
a
mark-down
basis.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
you
always
want
it
to
be
in
the
loss
situation,
a
reorganization.
another
answer
is
that
the
loss
situation
usually
occurs
in
insolvency
type
reorganizations
and
insolvency
reorganizations
are
governed
by
other
provisions
(b)
(10)
and
section
(l).
i
would
like
to
say
--
well
i
think
what
i've
said
is
in
summary
if
i
may,
what
i've
said
is
enough
to
answer
the
argument.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
wrong
with
the
argument
which
we've
tried
to
spell
out
in
the
brief.
thank
you.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
that
is
to
say
that
this
question
is
not
what
congress
wrote
in
the
basis
provision,
but
what
congress
wrote
for
this
limited
recognition.
we
are
in
a
limited
recognition
provision
going
back
to
1924
and
on
that
question,
the
tax
court
has
always
held
at
the
same
interpretation
and
it
is
declared
as
it
is
held
in
this
the
same
interpretation.
going
back
to
1934,
bruce,
in
1936
bonham,
in
1939
love,
there
was
also
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
first
seattle;
all
of
those
are
mentioned
in
a
footnote
on
page
11
in
our
brief.
and
finally,
in
bonham
where
the
--
pardon
me,
in
turnbow
in
the
tax
court
where
the
court
itself
said,
thus
there
has
been
a
long
standing
and
continuous
construction
of
section
112
(c)
(1)
and
the
corresponding
section
in
the
earlier
revenue
acts
which
has
remained
unchanged
over
the
years
in
the
face
of
several
reenactments
of
the
statutory
provision.
and
in
the
light
of
the
tax
court's
own
declaration
without
any
division
of
opinion
throughout
all
this
years
that
that
was
an
interpretation
of
section
112
(c)
(1)
that
comes
as
somewhat
of
a
shock
for
the
attorney,
for
the
government
to
say
that
these
decisions
were
non-existent.
they
did
exist
and
the
taxpayers
had
a
right
to
rely
upon
them.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
