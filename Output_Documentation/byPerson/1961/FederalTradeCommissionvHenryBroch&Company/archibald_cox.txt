mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice.
the
broch
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
question
very
closely
related
to
the
question
which
i've
just
been
arguing
to
the
court.
the
writ
was
issued
to
review
a
decree
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
which
that
court
on
its
own
motion
modified
an
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
in
a
case
arising
under
section
2
(c)
of
clayton
act,
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
may
recall
that
this
is
the
second
time
that
the
case
has
been
here.
it
was
here
on
the
merits,
that
is
to
say,
on
the
question
of
whether
the
broch
company
had
violated
section
2
(c)
and
was
decided
in
an
opinion
mr.
justice
douglas
reported
in
363
united
states.
there
were
four
justices
who
dissented
but
the
merit,
as
i
take
it,
it
has
now
been
settled
and
the
case
is
here
on
the
question
concerning
the
scope
of
relief
which
is
certainly
parallel
and
we
think
virtually
identical
to
the
question
presented
in
the
ochoa
case
that
was
just
argued.
here,
there
are
two
questions.
the
first
is
whether
a
court
of
appeals
may
cut
down
the
scope
of
a
federal
trade
commission
order
on
the
ground
that
it
is
broader
than
the
proven
violation
warrant
where
the
respondent
had
the
opportunity
to
object
to
the
scope
of
the
order
before
the
commission,
but
raised
no
question
about
its
scope
at
that
time.
and
we
submit
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
--
i
don't
--
no
authority,
i
was
about
to
say,
i
was
hoping
the
jurisdictional
sense
as
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
cutting
down
the
scope
of
the
order.
assuming
that
the
court
decides
that
question
against
the
government,
then
the
second
question
is
raised,
which
is
whether
the
commission
upon
finding
that
a
seller's
broker
has
unlawfully
passed
on
part
of
his
commission
to
a
large
scale
buyer
as
way
of
producing
price
or
the
buyer's
cost
in
violation
of
section
2
(c).
then
has
the
federal
trade
commission
discretion
to
forbid
the
buyer
from
engaging
in
the
same
unlawful
practice
in
relation
to
other
buyers
and
sellers
or
must
the
federal
trade
commission
order
be
confined
as
a
matter
of
law
to
unlawfully
passing
on
the
brokerage
in
future
sales
between
the
same
seller
and
same
buyer,
leaving
in
freeze,
so
far
as
the
order
is
concerned,
to
repeat
the
unlawful
practice
in
sales
for
other
sellers
to
other
buyers.
the
facts
of
the
case,
they
recall,
although
i
think
i
need
to
do
it
only
briefly.
upon
the
usual
proceedings,
the
hearing
examiner
found
that
the
respondent
broch
was
a
broker
engaged
in
selling
food
products
for
canada
foods
with
the
understanding
that
his
commission
would
be
5%.
now,
canada
foods
had
fixed
the
price
of
a
$1.30
a
gallon
for
apple
juice.
a
large
scale
prospective
buyer,
smucker,
had
through
another
broker
offered
at
$1.25.
it
then
replied
the
price
was
$1.30
and
the
word
got
out
that
the
only
way
the
price
could
be
reduced
was
by
--
reduced
by
the
broker.
broch
then
arranged
two
sales
from
the
canada
foods
to
smucker
at
$1.25.
broch
agreed
to
reduce
his
commission
from
5%
to
3%
so
that
broch
absorb
two
and
a
half
cents
a
gallon
and
canada
foods
absorb
the
other
two
and
a
half
cents
a
gallon
in
order
to
make
the
sale
to
smucker.
the
initial
decision
as
it's
called
in
the
federal
trade
commission
the
trial
examiner's
report,
as
i
fear,
i
may
call
it
at
familiarity
with
the
labor
board,
found
these
facts
and
recommended
an
order
against
the
respondent.
the
proposed
order
is
significant.
it
appears
on
page
202
of
what
we
call
the
old
record
because
it's
the
record
that
was
used
when
the
case
was
here
on
the
merits
and
it's
somewhat
the
fatter
of
the
two
brown
volumes.
the
order
directed
--
the
order
proposed
that
respondent
be
directed
forthwith
to
cease-and-desist
from
paying,
granting
or
allowing,
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
j.m.
smucker
company
or
to
any
other
buyer
and
the
critical
words
in
this
case
are
the
words
“to
any
other
buyer”
or
to
anyone
acting
for
in
behalf
of
--
or
in
behalf
of
or
subject
to
the
direct
or
indirect
role
of
such
buyer,
what
is
forbidden
to
pay,
grant
or
allow
any
allowance
or
discount
in
lieu
of
brokerage,
or
any
part
of
percentage,
by
selling
any
food
products
to
such
buyer
at
prices
reflecting
a
reduction
from
the
prices
at
which
sales
for
such
food
are
currently
being
affected
by
respondents
for
canada
foods
limited
or
for
any
other
seller
principal,
and
the
words
“or
any
other
seller
principal”
are
in
controversy
as
the
case
maybe,
where
the
reduction
in
price
is
accompanied
by
a
reduction
in
the
regular
rate
of
brokerages
is
another.
and
then
paragraph
(2)
again,
orders
broch
to
cease-and-desist
from
in
any
other
manner
paying,
granting
or
allowing
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
j.m.
smucker
company
or
to
any
other
buyer,
anything
of
value
as
a
commission
brokerage
or
other
compensation
in
connection
with
any
sale
of
food
or
food
products
to
such
buyer
for
its
own
account.
in
other
words,
they
ordered,
proposed
that
the
respondent
be
directed
to
cease
from
unlawfully
passing
on
its
brokerage
commission
as
a
way
of
giving
the
buyer
a
lower
price
not
only
in
making
sales
on
behalf
of
canada
foods
to
smucker
but
in
making
sales
on
behalf
of
any
other
seller
to
any
other
buyer
of
food
products.
when
the
hearing
officer
made
his
initial
decision,
the
respondent
filed
a
notion
of
appeal
to
the
full
commission.
and
commission
has
rules
relating
to
the
way
in
which
appeal
should
be
taken
and
specifically
to
the
way
in
which
points
shall
be
raised
on
an
appeal.
the
pertinent
rule
appears
at
page
45
of
the
new
record.
down
at
the
--
below
the
heading
which
is
about
the
third
of
the
way
down
the
page.
you'll
notice
that
first
it
speaks
of
who
may
appeal
and
then
content
of
appealed
brief.
the
appeal
should
be
in
the
form
of
a
brief
and
shall
contain
in
the
order
indicated
below
the
following.
a
list
of
the
questions
involved
and
to
be
argued,
an
argument
presenting
clearly
the
facts
of
law,
in
fact
it
relied
on
in
support
of
a
position
taken
on
each
question.
respondent
filed
a
brief
in
that
form.
the
brief
made
no
objection
whatsoever
with
the
respect
to
the
scope
of
the
order.
in
other
words
also,
there
was
a
case
where
the
examiner
not
only
dealt
with
the
substantive
question
of
whether
there
was
a
violation
but
also
recommended
a
specific
order
so
the
respondent
had
full
warning
of
what
was
proposed.
his
brief
was
confined
to
arguments
that
he
hadn't
violated
section
2
(c)
and
there's
nothing
whatsoever,
which
even
suggest
any
objection
to
the
scope
of
this
order,
assuming
that
a
violation
of
section
2
(c)
was
found
to
occur.
the
federal
trade
commission's
decision
approved
in
general
the
theory
that
the
examiner
had
adopted.
and
specifically,
the
commission
entered
the
order
which
was
in
the
examiner's
proposed
--
in
the
examiner's
initial
decision.
the
case
was
then
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
again,
the
argument
went
to
the
substantive
questions
of
law
and
there
was
no
suggestion
that
if
the
substantive
questions
were
ruled
against
the
respondent
that
the
order
was
still
too
broad.
the
seventh
circuit
sustained
the
respondent's
position
on
the
merits.
your
honors
will
recall
that
it
held
at
section
2
(c)
was
not
applicable
to
a
seller's
broker
and
also
that
the
respondent,
broch,
did
not
make
any
allowance
in
lieu
of
brokerage.
that
decision
was
reversed,
as
i
said
earlier,
in
an
opinion
in
363
u.s.
written
by
justice
douglas
and
four
members
of
the
court
dissenting.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
comparable
to
10
(e).
i
shall
argue
that
the
same
rule
exists
as
a
matter
of
administrative
law
and
the
decisions
of
this
court.
there's
no
statutory
provision
that
is
comparable
with
the
respect
to
raising
questions
below.
when
the
case
got
back
to
the
seventh
circuit,
the
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
set
aside
or
modify
the
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
and
he
raised
what
i
think
we
can
conveniently
describe
as
three
kinds
of
questions.
first
is
the
court
to
find
that
the
allowance
in
that
particular
case
had
been
justified
by
various
economist
and
competitive
considerations
that
argued
that
that
was
a
question
that
hadn't
been
decided
by
this
court.
the
seventh
circuit
apparently
denied
that
argument.
his
second
request
before
the
seventh
circuit
was
that
it
modify
the
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
in
relation
to
the
kind
of
practice
that
it
prohibited.
the
argument
stated
very
shortly
was
that
the
order
forbad
the
respondent
to
do
certain
kinds
of
things
which
this
court
had
not
adjudicated
in
the
case
of
the
merits
and
then
it
was
to
-
i
think
in
vertical
direction,
it
covered
too
many
kinds
of
conduct.
it
was
phrased
in
the
words
of
2
(c).
the
seventh
circuit
was
apparently
persuaded
by
that
argument
because
it
didn't
modify
the
order
in
that
respect.
the
third
type
of
objection
raised
by
the
respondent
in
the
seventh
circuit
was
that
the
order
didn't
simply
forbid
him
not
to
engage
in
these
unlawful
practices
in
effectuating
sales
between
canada
foods
and
smucker
but
told
him
not
to
engage
in
the
unlawful
practices
at
all.
and
he
objected
to
that
on
the
ground
that
such
an
order
was
too
broad
because
the
only
sale
–
sales,
there
were
two
of
them,
proved
in
the
record
where
sales
from
canada
foods
to
smucker.
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
respondent's
motion
in
all
respects.
then
on
the
court's
own
motion,
it
entered
an
order
striking
out
the
words
“on
behalf
of
any
other
seller”
or
“in
sales
to
any
other
buyer”
so
as
to
confine
the
order
to
one
to
stop
passing
on
brokerage
unlawfully
when
you're
selling
goods
from
canada
foods
to
smucker.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
gave
no
explanation,
your
honor.
and
i
could
only
speculate.
this
was
the
same
court,
if
my
memory
is
correct,
that
had
decided
the
brandman
iron
case.
i
think
its
reasoning,
and
i
do
want
to
make
it
clear,
i'm
just
speculating.
i
think
its
reasoning
must
have
been
this
that
it
recognized
that
under
10
(e)
now,
i'm
now
speaking
of
the
labor
case,
the
respondent
had
no
right
to
raise
such
questions.
and
i
infer
that
it
assumed
that
the
same
rule
was
applicable
under
the
tucker
freight
lines
case,
other
decisions
even
so
there
was
no
such
provision
in
the
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
mistakenly,
i
think
the
court
felt
that
although
there
was
no
--
although
the
respondent
had
no
standard,
nevertheless
the
court
on
the
theory
in
justice
stone's
concurring
opinion
in
cheney
had
an
--
a
court
responsibility,
a
judicial
responsibility
for
the
order
and
that
on
its
own
motion,
it
had
power
to
change
it.
now,
of
course,
in
doing
that,
it
overlooked
several
decisions
by
this
court.
one
in
a
case
involving
the
united
mine
workers
written
by
justice
brennan,
another
in
a
case
coming
from
the
federal
power
commission
where
it
was
squarely
held
in
each
instance
in
the
federal
power
commission
case
after
some
discussion
that
the
same
statutory
provision
forbids
the
court
to
look
at
objections
that
were
not
raised
below
on
its
own
motion
because
indeed
the
language,
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
was
that
--
was
that
the
court
shall
not
consider.
it
wasn't
that
the
respondent
shall
not
raise.
now,
i'm
told
--
i
want
to
infer
that
i've
made
one
mistake.
i
was
under
the
impression
with
the
brandman
iron
case
was
a
seventh
circuit
case.
i
am
now
told
that
i
am
in
error
that
it
was
a
sixth
circuit
case
and
at
my
attempt
to
explain
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
on
the
basis
of
the
brandman,
the
court
said
they're
innovated
in
--
in
that
opinion,
maybe
a
nice
theory
but
it
doesn't
correspond
to
the
facts.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
--
the
order
in
this
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
entered
november
3,
1960,
it
followed
by
months
and
a
half
judge
aldrich's
opinion
in
the
first
circuit.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
which
they
had
acted
on
their
own
motion.
i
do
not
know
whether
that
case
has
been
called
to
the
seventh
circuit's
attention
by
mr.
rowe.
there
maybe
some
connection
there
obviously.
now,
that
the
case
is
here,
our
argument
is
two-fold.
first,
we
submit
that
the
court
below
erred
as
a
matter
of
law
in
cutting
down
the
scope
of
the
federal
trade
commission
order
in
a
case
where
the
respondent
had
the
opportunity
to
raise
a
question
concerning
the
scope
of
the
order
before
the
commission
and
failed
to
do
it
in
violation
of
the
commission
rule.
second,
we
say
that
if
the
court
considers
the
merits
of
the
order,
that
the
commission's
order
was
proper
and
then
it
was
not
required
to
limited
its
order
to
cease-and-desist
to
sales
made
on
behalf
of
canada
foods
to
smucker,
but
could
forbid
the
continuation
of
the
unlawful
practice
in
sales
between
any
buyer
and
so
on.
i
would
emphasize
first
that
petitioner
again
did
not
raise
the
contention
before
the
federal
trade
commission.
you'll
recall
that
the
hearing
examiner
did
recommend
this
precise
order
that
the
rules
concerning
appeals
to
the
commission
require
you
to
set
forth
what
your
exceptions
are
in
the
form
of
questions
presented
in
the
brief
and
that
this
was
not
done.
now,
the
respondent
offers
two
arguments.
first,
he
says,
“well,
the
government
says
in
its
brief
that
the
federal
trade
commission
that
does
consider
the
scope
of
orders
even
so
no
exception
is
made
by
the
respondent.”
and
of
course
that
is
true
up
to
a
point.
now
the
commission
has
a
responsibility
for
the
order
that
it
enters
and
as
i
understand
it
therefore,
it
does
consider
in
general
but
it
takes
the
scope
where
the
order
should
be
and
if
there's
nothing
that
appears
wrong
with
it,
as
proposed
by
the
examiner,
then
it
goes
out.
but
i
submit
that
that
is
an
altogether
different
kind
of
consideration
from
the
consideration
that
it
administered
in
agency
or
a
court
will
give
to
--
an
order
or
a
question
where
the
problem
is
raised.
it's
not
unlike
the
situation
with
respect
to
a
judge's
charge.
he
considers
what
he
instructs
the
jury
but
of
course
the
rules
required
the
party
who
objects
to
the
charge
to
point
out
to
the
parts
that
are
wrong
and
so
that
the
judge
may
really
concentrate
his
attention
on
it
and
consider
whether
a
change
should
be
made,
what
the
precise
facts
are
in
some
detail
and
so
it
is
with
an
administrative
agency
unless
the
point
is
raised,
the
type
of
consideration
is
bound
to
be
different
from
what
it
is
where
the
point
has
been
thoroughly
briefed
and
argued.
the
respondent's
other
proposition
as
i
understand
it
is
--
well,
we
challenge
the
order
at
every
turn.
that
of
course
is
true
but
a
challenge
to
the
order
of
the
merits
raising
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
or
questions
of
the
fact
on
the
record
is
quite
different
from
a
challenge
to
the
scope
of
the
order
which
is
to
be
entered
once
the
unlawful
practice
is
established.
respondent
suggests
that
after
the
case
went
back
from
this
court,
it
asks
for
administrative
consideration
of
the
scope
of
the
order.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
record
hardly
sustains
that.
what
the
respondent
did
was
to
request
the
court
of
appeals
to
summarily
set
aside
or
modify
the
commission's
order
or
to
remand
the
proceeding
for
appropriate
further
action
by
the
commission
itself.
this
was
not
in
any
sense
a
request
to
the
commission
and
indeed,
it
wasn't
any
primary
request
anyway.
it
was
a
sort
of
a
falling
back.
if
you
won't
give
me
what
i
want,
we'll
then
send
it
back
to
the
commission.
it
didn't
ask
the
commission
to
do
anything.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
further
proceedings
in
accordance
to
this
(inaudible).
mr.
archibald
cox
the
case
went
back
to
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
the
commission
responds
and
argues,
i
see
no
reason
to
challenge
it,
would
have
the
power
to
modify
its
order
under
those
conditions.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
guess
--
well,
i
thought
--
it
suggested
in
mr.
rowe's
brief
that
i
thought
no
reason
to
quarrel
with
him
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
the
commission
could
have
done
it
even
while
the
case
was
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
we
said
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
was
surprised
i
confer
this.
but
as
i
say,
i
saw
--
i
saw
no
reason
to
argue
and
indeed
without
any
disrespect,
may
i
suggest
that
it's
irrelevant
anyway
because
the
point
is
that
of
course
it
was
not
presented
to
the
commission.
i
don't
say
he
didn't
do
everything
he
could
at
that
stage.
but
he
hadn't
done
what
he's
required
to
at
the
time
he
was
required
to
do
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
and
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
the
first
time
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
wasn't
raise
here
in
a
petition
to
rehear
it,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
first
raised
on
the
--
in
the
motion
filed
by
the
respondent
in
the
court
below
when
the
case
went
back
on
remand
from
this
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
--
i
don't
recall.
i
don't
think
i
noticed
anything
in
this
court's
opinion.
it
would
suggest
that
the
--
this
order
should
leave
the
respondent
free
to
commit
this
--
this
unlawful
practices.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
certainly
a
narrow
opinion
and
it
put
aside
some
preference.
now,
with
respect
that
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
think
that
--
well,
perhaps
you
thought
of
it
before,
it's
quite
true
that
in
arguing
the
scopes
of
the
order
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
practices
forbidden
that
mr.
rowe
pointed
out
in
the
seventh
circuit
as
he
does
here
to
the
fact
that
the
court
has
not
ruled
in
this
case
upon
all
the
questions
that
might
arise
concerning
the
interpretation
of
section
2
(c).
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
court
below
did
not
adopt
that
theory.
it
didn't
modify
this
order
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
ways
of
passing
on
brokerage
that
would
be
forbidden.
it
simply
cut
it
down
with
respect
to
on
whose
behalf
you
could
engage
in
the
unlawful
practice.
so
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
terms
of
the
scope
of
the
order
with
respect
to
parties,
if
i
may
use
what
isn't
a
really
accurate
word
with
respect
to
person's
effect,
there
was
nothing
in
this
court's
opinion
to
justify
raising
a
point.
and
the
other
point
was
not
sustained
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
of
course,
there
was
no
cross-petition,
so
it
isn't
properly
here
because
if
there
were
merit
to
it,
which
we
denied,
it
would
require
a
modification
of
the
decree
at
that
kind
of
a
point
may
not
be
presented
to
the
court
unless
it
is
raised
by
the
respondent
on
a
cross-petition.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
it
won't.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
--
i
think
it
was
natural
that
it
was
raised
here
and
i
don't
hold
that
against
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
the
failure
to
raise
it
for
the
commission.
mr.
archibald
cox
(voice
overlap)
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
correct.
i
think
so
too.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
should
have
been
made
as
soon
as
the
hearing
examiner
made
what
they
call
an
initial
decision
or
a
proposed
decision,
setting
forth
the
report,
the
order
that
he
recommended
because
at
that
time,
the
respondent
had
fair
notice
of
what
kind
of
an
order
was
proposed.
if
he
had
any
objections,
he
should
have
set
them
forth
then
that
they
could
have
been
examined
and
any
additional
relevant
facts
could
have
been
put
in
the
record
and
that
i
think
indisputably,
he
failed
to
do.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
not
since
he
failed
to
raise
it
below.
i
think
he
could
have
raised
it
perhaps
but
we
don't
need
to
pass
on
this.
i
think
perhaps
he
could
have
raised
it
on
a
petition
for
reconsideration,
rehearing
before
the
commission
after
it
had
passed
on
the
main
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
raised
in
here
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
would
think
we
hadn't
presented
it
to
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
not
for
this
reason.
i
think
a
good
way
to
test
the
point
is
to
inquire
whether
when
he
first
went
to
the
seventh
circuit,
he
could
then
have
said
to
the
seventh
circuit,
point
one,
there
was
no
violation
of
section
2
(c);
point
two,
even
if
there
was,
the
order
was
too
broad.
and
i
would
say
that
he
could
not
--
that
that
indeed
is
the
very
state
that
the
rule
of
administrative
law
is
directed
to
and
that
while
we
can
get
it
more
complicated
by
bringing
different
courts
in,
that
they
all
come
back
to
that
fundamental
(voice
overlap)
mr.
archibald
cox
it
had
to
be.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
had
to
be.
now,
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
recognize
one
possible
distinction
in
going
through
these
cases,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
sometimes
this
situates
--
sometimes
this
situation
develops.
there
may
be
two
disputes
with
respect
to
the
substantive
meaning
of
the
statute.
for
example,
let's
assume
that
instead
of
one
kind
of
practice
here,
there
has
been
different
ways
on
passing
on
broker,
that
he
might
have
said,
point
one,
the
statute
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
a
seller's
broker
which
case
you
wouldn't
have
to
go
on
by
the
second
question.
he
might
say,
point
two,
leave
it
if
he
applies
to
me
and
practice
a
is
on
unlawful,
it
doesn't
forbid
practice
b.
now,
i
will
take
if
he
had
raised
that
substantive
question,
his
failure
to
raise
the
parallel
question
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
the
order
would
be
immaterial
because
he's
--
he's
attracted
attention
to
the
question.
but
here,
of
course,
the
underlying
question
is
whether
unlawfully
passing
on
brokers,
underlying
question
for
the
commission,
would
have
been
whether
unlawfully
passing
on
brokerage
to
smucker,
the
sales
from
canada
foods,
properly
gave
rise
to
an
inference
that
unless
restrained
respondent
would
give
way
to
pressures
from
big
buyer
--
other
big
buyers
in
similar
situations
or
was
there's
something
so
peculiar
about
the
relations
between
canada
foods,
respondent
to
smucker
that
the
fact
that
he'd
committed
the
unlawful
practice
in
that
instance,
gave
no
reason
as
supposed,
that
he
would
commit
the
unlawful
practice
on
behalf
of
that
another
seller.
now,
that
type
of
question,
there
was
nothing
in
his
presentation
before
the
commission
that
would
have
directed
its
mind
to
that
type
of
question.
so
i
do
think
that
some
of
the
general
statements
we've
been
made
permitted
that
distinction.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
before
the
recess,
i
had
pointed
out
that
the
respondent
did
not
raise
the
subjection
to
the
scope
of
the
order
when
it
was
before
the
federal
trade
commission
upon
the
initial
decision
or
the
hearing
examiner's
proposed
order.
having
failed
to
raise
the
question
there,
we
submit,
that
he
could
not
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
erred
not
only
in
permitting
him
to
raise
it
indirectly,
but
in
modifying
the
order
on
its
own
motion.
as
i
pointed
out
in
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
therefore
this
case
defer
from
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
preceding
case.
and
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
the
clayton
act
do
not
contain
any
express
provision
declaring
that
the
reviewing
court
shall
not
consider
a
question
which
was
not
called
to
the
attention
of
the
administrative
agency.
as
a
matter
of
history
and
language,
i
would
think
that
no
significance
could
possibly
be
attributed
to
the
distinction
because
the
fact
is
that
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
the
clayton
act
were
both
enacted
back
50
years
--
not
quite
50
years,
45
or
so
years
ago
before
our
present
notions
of
administrative
law
had
thoroughly
evolved.
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions
that
the
same
substantive
rule
of
law
governs
those
agencies
like
the
government
cases
coming
from
those
agencies
like
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
federal
trade
commission
even
though
their
basic
statutes
do
not
contain
the
same
words.
i
suppose
that
the
most
complete
and
authoritative
discussion
of
that
point
was
in
the
tucker
freight
lines
case
--
tucker
truck
lines
case
in
344
u.s.,
where
again
the
statute
did
not
contain
this
language.
the
court
said,
“we
recognized
in
more
than
a
few
decisions
that
congress
has
recognized
in
more
than
a
few
statutes
that
orderly
procedure
and
good
administration
require
that
objections
to
the
proceedings
of
an
administrative
agency
be
made
while
it
has
opportunity
for
correction
in
order
to
raise
issues
reviewable
by
the
courts.
and
that
doctrine
has
been
specifically
applied
to
orders
and
objections
to
the
form
or
scope
of
orders
of
the
federal
trade
commission
in
the
moog
industries
case
where
the
question
was
whether
the
effect
--
what
should
be
the
effective
date
of
an
order
in
order
to
avoid
alleged
unfair
substantive
advantages
and
the
court
squarely
held
that
since
the
point
respecting
the
date
of
the
order
had
not
been
raised
before
the
commission,
it
could
not
be
presented
to
a
reviewing
court.
i
think
i
also
pointed
out
in
the
ochoa
case
that
there
are
other
decisions
holding
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
court
considers
this
kind
of
question
on
the
request
of
a
party
or
on
its
own
motion
and
of
course
the
absurdity
of
such
a
distinction
is
brought
out
in
this
case
where
the
party
raised
it.
the
court
dismissed
his
motion
and
then
on
its
own
motion
changed
the
order.
one
can't
believe
that
what
really
happened
wasn't
that
party
raised
a
question
and
the
court
heeded
its
motion.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
--
i
would
think
not.
now,
as
said
to
justice
frankfurter
before
the
recess,
i
would
think
a
challenge
to
findings
or
rulings
with
the
respect
to
what
was
a
substantive
violation
of
the
statute
would
necessarily
imply
a
challenge
to
the
parts
of
the
order
that
were
based
upon
the
agency's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
then
let's
suppose
for
example
that
the
argument
in
this
case
had
been,
that
although
section
2
(c)
applies
to
seller's
brokers
and
forbids
the
broker
himself
to
pass
on
the
brokerage
to
the
buyer,
actually
hand
the
money
to
it
that
it
does
not
apply
where
the
broker
simply
reduces
his
brokerage
fee
and
what
is
passed
on
to
the
buyer
is
left
in
the
discretion
of
the
seller.
now,
i
would
think
that
if
mr.
rowe
had
raised
that
argument
before
the
commission
that
it
would
not
--
i
don't
think
it
had
any
merits,
but
assume
that
it
were
held
to
have
merit,
i
do
not
think
it
would
lie
in
the
commission's
mouth
to
come
before
the
court
and
say,
“well,
you
raised
that
substantively
but
you
didn't
object
to
an
order
that
covered
the
second
as
well
as
the
first,”
but
here
you
see,
as
i
suggested
to
justice
frankfurter
before
the
recess,
no
one
raised
the
question
--
no
one
raised
before
the
commission
the
factual
question
upon
which
the
issue
now
before
this
court
depends
if
it
gets
to
the
merit.
whether
the
order
should
include
references
to
other
sellers
or
other
buyers,
depends
before
the
commission
and
here
forgot
the
merit,
on
whether
passing
on
this
brokerage
fee
indicates
that
this
is
a
fellow
who
is
likely
to
pass
on
brokerage
fees
or
indicates
that
this
is
a
fellow
who
is
likely
to
pass
on
brokerage
fees
in
transactions
between
canada
and
smucker.
in
other
words
nothing
to
suggest,
there
was
no
objection
raised
that
would
suggest
there's
something
peculiar
about
the
transaction
between
canada
and
smucker
that
couldn't
repeat
itself
in
transactions
between
other
sellers
and
buyers.
and
therefore,
there
was
no
objection
raised
that
would
direct
the
board's
attention
to
that
question
which
was
the
--
one
underlying
i
think,
the
basic
scope
for
the
order.
so
i
would
think
that
a
blanket
objection
to
the
order
based
on
entirely
different
grounds
that
would
not
suggest
then
and
went
only
to
matters
of
substance,
it
couldn't
in
any
sense
be
said
to
include
an
objection
of
this
kind.
mr.
archibald
cox
your
--
there
is
a
difference
between
the
clayton
act
which
is
the
one
we're
dealing
with
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
the
national
labor
relations
act.
when
the
federal
trade
commission
makes
it
cease-and-desist
order
then
the
respondent
may
take
it
to
the
court
and
secure
review.
no
order
of
enforcement
which
is
punishable
by
contempt
could
be
made
under
the
original
clayton
act
at
that
stage.
therefore,
in
order
--
and
that
statute
incidentally
applies
to
this
case
so
that
in
order
to
proceed
for
a
violation
of
an
order
under
the
clayton
act,
the
commission
must
have
a
new
independent
proceeding
finding
that
the
order
had
been
violated.
now
that
if
there
was
no
petition
for
review
then
of
course
that
will
be
a
second
administrative
proceeding.
having
found
that
the
order
had
been
violated,
it
then
could
go
to
the
court
for
the
enforcement
of
that
order.
and
so
here,
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
these
cases
as
i
understand
it,
respondent
would
not
immediately
be
subject
to
citation
for
contempt
if
he
violated
this
order.
it
would
have
to
be
a
new
violation
proved
before
the
federal
trade
commission
and
then
it
could
go
to
the
court
getting
an
order
of
enforcement.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
wouldn't
think
it
should
because
i
would
think
that
the
underlying
reasons
were
basically
the
same.
as
i
see
it,
there
are
several
reasons
for
this
rule
which
i
submit
it's
a
rule
of
administrative
law
applicable
to
all
agencies
as
well
as
one
embodied
in
some
statutes.
certainly
one
reason
is
that
it's
--
it's
only
fair
to
the
other
people
concerned
that
you
give
the
agency
as
was
pointed
out
from
the
tucker
truck
lines
case
that
you
give
the
agency
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
point
before
you
go
to
court
and
attempt
to
undo
everything
that
was
done
below.
now,
the
second
reason
i
think
as
we've
pointed
out
on
several
occasions
is
that
the
question
on
which
the
scope
of
the
ordered
depends
is
essentially
a
question
of
fact.
if
the
question
is
raised
before
the
agency
so
that
it
knows
there's
some
controversy
about
the
scope
of
the
order
then
it
may
either
make
its
order
on
the
record
before
it
or
it
might
order
the
proceedings
reopened
to
take
new
testimony
on
this
point,
but
if
the
respondent
can
lie
back
and
not
present
it
and
then
raise
it
in
court,
it
may
say
the
opportunity
to
build
a
record
on
the
point
has
been
lost
unless,
of
course,
the
case
gotten
--
go
back
with
further
delays
and
various
motions.
then
there's
another
part
which
ties
in
with
an
observation
that
justice
frankfurter
made
during
the
last
case.
if
the
point
is
raised
before
the
agency,
then
the
agency
has
an
occasion
to
explicate
its
reasons.
it
has
some
--
the
case
had
been
argued,
it
has
some
reason
to
spell
out
why
it
did
what
it
did,
but
if
there's
no
indication
that
the
issue
was
in
controversy,
it's
all
too
easy
and
unfortunately
the
agency
do
have
to
grind
out
a
great
volume
of
work,
it's
all
too
easy
not
to
bother
to
set
it
down
because
apparently,
nobody
is
arguing
about
it
and
under
the
normal
rule,
having
failed
to
raise
the
question
for
the
agency,
it
wouldn't
come
up
in
court.
now,
i
submit
this
is
really
important
to
judicial
administration
as
well
as
agency
administration
because
if
as
justice
frankfurter
has
suggested,
the
reasoning
of
the
agency
is
fully
explicated,
it
gives
the
court
an
opportunity
to
pass
a
far
wiser
judgment
upon
the
question
on
review
and
the
thing
which
invokes
the
explication
is
raising
the
point
below
and
if
you
don't
raise
it
below,
there
is
no
reason
to
use
unnecessary
ink
and
paper
giving
reasons
for
things
that
are
requested.
then
there's
still
fourth
reason
i
think
that
if
the
party
is
able
to
lie
back
and
not
raise
the
question
before
the
agency,
then
if
the
order
is
too
broad,
it's
going
to
be
rewritten
in
the
court.
and
that
means
that
the
framing
of
the
final
order
will
not
be
done
by
the
expert
body,
the
body
that's
familiar
with
the
theory,
that
has
the
specialized
knowledge
which
this
court
is
often
said
was
important
to
take
in
to
account
in
writing
an
order
but
instead
will
be
done,
i
fear
too
often
in
a
somewhat
verbal
fashion
as
occurred
in
the
first
circuit
in
the
ochoa
instance
without
adequate
appreciation
of
the
differences
between
different
kinds
of
violations
of
relations
between
parties
who
have
different
institutional
arrangements
and
the
like.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
think
it
contemplated
that
the
modification
would
be
made
on
a
record
dealing
with
this
and
after
the
benefit
of
the
judgment
of
the
agency.
now,
surely
congress
didn't
remove
this
function
entirely
from
the
courts,
i
don't
think
that
the
thrust
of
my
argument
is
that
the
court
couldn't
ever
modify
an
order
and
neither
do
i
mean
to
imply
that
it
was
bad
--
so
bad
that
it
couldn't
be
done
in
any
instance
to
have
the
court
modify
it.
all
i've
been
saying
is
that
it's
desirable
in
the
greatest
number
of
cases
to
have
the
modification
of
too
broad
an
order
made
by
the
agency
and
that
in
order
to
gain
that
advantage,
it
is
sound
to
require
the
parties
to
present
the
question
to
the
agency.
now
of
course,
if
the
order
is
too
broad,
not
in
the
sense
that
it's
broader
than
it
ought
to
be
but
it
is
too
broad
in
the
sense
that
it
has
no
reason
--
could
not
reasonably
be
thought
to
have
a
relation
to
the
threatened
violations.
then
of
course,
the
court
must
do
the
cutting
down
and
the
disadvantage
i
would
mention
would
come
about,
but
the
rule
of
administrative
law
i
suggest
would
at
least
reduce
the
number
of
those
occasions
and
would
seem
to
me
to
be
sound
administration
from
the
standpoint
of
the
courts
as
well
as
the
agency.
i'd
like
to
pass
on
now
and
spend
a
few
minutes
discussing
the
case
on
the
assumption
which
i
hope
to
prove
unfounded
if
the
court
does
conclude
that
the
court
below
had
the
power
in
a
loose
end
to
reach
the
underlying
question
because
we
think
that
the
federal
trade
commission
order,
even
if
the
questions
were
opened
should
be
held
proper
here
that
it
was
certainly
within
the
scope
of
the
commission
discretion.
i
take
that
it's
common
ground
that
the
purpose
of
such
an
order
is
to
prevent
violations,
the
threat
of
which
in
the
future
is
indicated
because
of
their
similarity
or
relation
to
those
unlawful
acts
which
occurred
in
the
past.
i've
taken
the
language
from
mr.
justice
stone's
opinion
in
the
express
publishing
case
and
it
seems
to
me
a
task
which
has
been
applied
over
and
over
again.
in
asking
this,
we
should
remind
ourselves
that
the
commission
is
not
limited
to
prohibiting
the
illegal
practice
in
the
exact
form
in
which
it
was
found
to
exist
in
the
past,
that
it
maybe
somewhat
broader.
that
the
commission
has
wide
discretion
that
it
may
as
the
court
has
often
said,
“drawn
its
expert
knowledge
or
generalize
experience.”
and
the
question
is
whether
the
order
that
was
entered
has
no
reasonable
relation
to
what
the
purpose
of
the
order
should
be
to
the
--
preventing
the
reputation
of
the
kinds
of
conduct
which
one
has
reason
to
fear
because
of
what
occurred
before.
now,
in
the
instant
case
as
a
practical
matter,
the
federal
trade
commission
on
the
issue
now
before
the
court
had
only
this
choice.
it
could
issue
the
order
that
it
did
issue
forbidding
the
unlawful
passing
on
of
the
brokerage
in
relation
to
sales
on
behalf
of
any
seller,
to
any
buyer
or
it
could
have
made
an
order
which
said
don't
unlawfully
pass
on
brokerage
when
you're
acting
as
a
broker
for
canada
foods
in
selling
to
smucker.
there
was
no,
virtually
no
practical
in
between
ground
and
the
order
would,
in
this
respect,
have
to
be
one
or
the
other.
now,
i
submit
first
that
this
order
conforms
very
closely
to
what
the
statute
tells
the
commission
to
do.
it
says
that
where
the
commission
finds
that
there
have
been
violations
of
the
act
and
so
issue
would
caused
to
be
served
on
such
person
an
order
requiring
such
person
to
cease-and-desist
from
such
violations.
of
course,
the
violations
weren't
in
any
sense
personal.
there
were
violations
regardless
of
the
identity
of
smucker,
regardless
of
the
identity
of
canada
foods.
the
violation
was
unlawfully
passing
on
brokerage
and
what
the
order
entered
by
the
commission
is,
“don't
pass
on
brokerage.”
so
that
i
think
that
it
corresponds
very
closely
to
just
what
the
statute
told
the
commission
to
do
and
it's
very
close
to
what
justice
stone
said
in
the
express
publishing
case
with
respect
to
an
order
cease-and-desist
from
refusing
to
bargain
collectively.
there
was
an
objection
to
that
and
the
court
said,
“the
unfair
labor
practice
was
refusing
to
bargain
collectively”
and
the
statute
said,
“you
shall
enter
an
order
requiring
the
respondent
to
cease-and-desist
from
the
unfair
practice.”
i
point
out
further
that
this
is
the
kind
of
violation
which
is
just
as
likely
to
be
performed
in
relation
to
one
buyer
or
in
behalf
of
one
seller
as
any
other.
there
was
nothing
in
the
relations
as
i
said
before
between
canada
foods
and
the
broker
that
would
suggest
that
he
was
more
likely
to
do
it
with
canada
foods
or
in
the
relations
between
smucker
and
the
broker.
smucker
was
simply
a
big
buyer.
and
if
the
broker
was
going
to
yield
to
this
temptation
for
one
big
buyer,
it
was
just
as
likely
to
be
yield
to
the
temptation
for
another
big
buyer
in
the
future
as
that
he
would
yield
to
it
for
this
big
buyer
in
the
future.
the
record
showed
that's
--
that
respondent
dealt
in
food
on
behalf
of
other
sellers
and
on
behalf
--
and
in
sales
to
other
buyers.
there
have
been
cases
where
the
commission's
orders
were
narrower
because
the
broker
acted
only
for
a
particular
buyer.
in
that
event,
it
would
be
wrong
to
enter
a
broad
order
arguably
at
least
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
union
which
represents
only
the
employee's
one
employer,
you
don't
enter
a
broad
general
order.
here,
the
violation
was
certainly
delivered
in
the
sense
that
not
that
he
necessarily
that
he
knew
it
would
violate
the
statute
but
it
wasn't
the
sort
of
thing
you
do
negligently
or
accidentally.
neither
was
it
the
sort
of
saying
which
might
happen
in
the
labor
case
where
you
have
a
lot
of
foreman
or
straw
bosses,
who
may
do
acts
that
you
ultimately
are
held
responsible
for.
this
was
a
topside
type
of
decision
and
was
made
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
with
a
good
deal
of
talk
back
and
forth.
that
being
true,
we
think
that
this
case
is
entirely
different
from
the
communications
workers
case
and
that
it
is
far
more
like
the
situation
that
was
presented
in
the
mandell
case
where
the
court
said
that
the
order
the
cease-and-desist
by
cover
not
only
the
failure
--
the
misrepresentations
that
the
respondents
had
made
but
also
certain
similar
misrepresentations.
it
is
like
the
gypsum
case
where
also
the
violations
had
occurred
in
one
geographical
area.
the
order
covered
other
geographical
areas
or
like
the
cement
case
where
the
order
--
where
the
violation
was
a
conspiracy
between
certain
parties
and
the
order
also
forbade
them
to
conspire
not
only
among
themselves
again
but
with
other
parties
to
engage
in
the
same
unlawful
practices
and
for
either
reason
independently,
we
submit
that
decision
below
was
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
may
i
--
may
i
comment
on
that
first
and
in
a
slightly
larger
context
because
that
--
i
will
deal
with
it
specifically
but
that
was
the
part
which
i
rose
to
deal
with
anyway.
there's
been
a
suggestion
or
at
least
a
question
raised
as
to
whether
the
modification
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
attempt
to
conform
the
order
to
the
opinion
of
this
court
and
i
must
respectfully
submit
that
that
clearly
is
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
would
equally
say
that
the
effort
to
change
the
order
was
in
no
sense
an
effort
to
clarify
any
of
the
points
as
to
which
mr.
rowe
says
it
was
uncertain.
now,
let
me
be
specific.
in
the
opinion
of
this
court,
there
are
three
points
on
which
mr.
rowe
sees
this.
one,
in
the
course
of
his
opinion,
mr.
justice
douglas
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
was
an
ad
hoc
passing
on
of
brokerage
in
an
effort
to
get
a
single
big
sale.
and
mr.
rowe
says,
“well,
then
maybe
we
ought
to
be
able
to
pass
on
brokerage
in
connection
with
big
--
all
big
sales.”
and
that's
a
point
which
the
supreme
court
did
not
adjudicate
and
the
order
should
be
modified
to
clarify
that
issue.
second,
he
says
that
with
respect
to
cases
where
the
buyer
may
render
some
services,
that
if
that
--
the
court
held
that
situation
to
open
and
did
not
say
whether
brokerage
could
be
passed
on
in
that
situation,
i
would
most
effectively
disagree
with
him.
i
think
the
--
no,
in
that
case,
the
court
did
hold
that
situation
open.
it's
the
third
one
where
i
would
disagree
with
him.
third,
he
says
there
maybe
situations
where
their
economies
in
connection
with
the
sale
to
a
particular
buyer
and
that
those
savings
and
costs
might
justify
passing
on
of
brokerage.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
clearly
did
say
no
to
that
point.
in
any
event,
when
mr.
rowe
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
he
had
--
we've
--
would've
disagreed
but
possibly
had
a
plausible
argument
that
the
language
of
section,
paragraph
1
or
paragraph
2
of
the
order
was
broad
enough
to
forbid
passing
on
brokerage
under
those
three
circumstances
which
were
perhaps
held
--
which
were
held
open
in
two
cases,
perhaps
by
the
opinion
of
this
court,
but
those
are
modifications
that
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
make
and
the
order
--
the
mandatory
--
the
parts
of
the
order
dealing
with
what
kind
of
practices
you
can
follow
were
left
in
turn
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
didn't
change
those.
if
it
had
been
deforming
to
the
order
of
this
court
so
as
to
leave
it
open
whether
those
practices
were
permitted
or
forbidden,
it
would
have
changed
the
part
of
the
order
that
deals
with
what
it
is
that
broch
is
forbidden
to
do.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
not
as
far
as
you
would
have
cut
it
down
if
that
had
been
your
theory.
it
is
true
that
if
it
is
too
broad
in
these
respects
then
he
has
heard
somebody
order
it
is
now
issued
but
not
as
much
as
he
would
have
been.
but
the
point
that
--
the
point
of
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
is
the
point
that
was
never
raised
in
any
stage
before
was
simply
the
inclusion
of
the
words
to
any
other
buyer.
now,
second
with
the
respect
to
the
--
whether
this
--
the
order
is
uncertain
in
these
respects,
what
we
were
trying
to
say
in
our
brief
is
this,
add
a
little
preference.
first,
it
is
quite
clear
under
the
prior
decisions
cited
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion
and
under
the
commission's
ruling
that
the
fact
that
the
buyer
has
rendered
some
services
is
not
a
defense
in
a
case
under
section
2
(c).
it's
true
that
justice
douglas
did
not
pass
on
that
but
it's
been
passed
on
plenty
of
time
by
courts
of
appeals.
similarly,
it's
quite
clearly
the
commission's
view
that
the
fact
that
there
are
some
alleged
economies
in
connection
with
the
sale
is
not
a
defense
under
section
2
(c).
there's
no
question
about
what
the
order
means
and
what
it
forbids
in
the
commission's
view.
what
we
were
seeking
to
say
was
that
if
later
this
question
comes
up
and
it
turns
out
that
the
commission
is
wrong,
the
statute
has
some
exceptions
that
the
commission
didn't
foresee,
then
as
stated
by
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
ruberiod
case,
the
order
can
be
read
to
be
cut
down
and
that
it
won't
interpreted
to
cover
everything
conceivably
within
its
terms.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
he
won't
--
in
this
case,
he
would
not
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
this
case,
he
would
not
be
in
contempt
because
this
order,
a
violation
of
this
order
cannot
result
in
contempt.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
see
this
is
under
the
old
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
knows
perfectly
well
that
what
the
commission's
view
of
the
law
is
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
alright,
these
points,
what
the
commission's
view
is,
it's
perfectly
clear
your
honor.
there's
no
uncertainty
about
the
commission's
view.
there's
no
uncertainty
about
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
excuse
me.
i
think
that
it
is
not
fair
to
say
that
the
commission's
orders
are
boilerplate.
the
commission
--
the
suggestion
that's
made,
in
mr.
rowe's
brief,
this
is
a
recent
habit
of
issuing
much
broader
orders.
it
is
true
that
the
commission
feels
generally
speaking
that
the
inference
from
a
violation
of
section
2
(c)
is
that
the
likelihood
of
other
violations
of
section
2
(c)
is
so
great,
but
unless
something
special
appears,
the
prohibition
should
be
as
broad
as
that
provision.
i
point
out
that
it
is
itself
a
comparatively
specific
restriction.
mr.
archibald
cox
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
--
i
would
think
that
fairly
could
be.
i
speak
with
less
conviction
on
that.
in
one
case
i
feel
that
i
can
speak
with
something
approaching
the
expertness
of
the
board.
in
this
case,
i
feel
that
i
don't
have
the
knowledge,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
argument
would
be
a
rational
and
reasonable
one.
now,
as
i
understand
the
commission's
view
that
although
it's
a
normal
case,
it
would
feel
that
a
violation
of
2(a)
should
result
in
the
kind
of
order
--
2
(c)
should
result
in
the
kind
of
order
entered
here
that
if
there
were
some
special
circumstances,
it
would
consider
them
and
it
might
issue
a
narrower
order.
suppose
for
example
that
broch
were
buying
only
for
a
particular
firm
then
the
order
would
not
be
general
in
relation
to
these
purchases
and
there
are
cases
that
indicate
that.
equally
if
he
were
selling
only
for
a
particular
firm,
it
would
not
be
general
and
one
can
imagine
other
cases
where
there
were
special
facts.
so
i
don't
think
that
it
is
quite
true
to
say
that
they
are
invariably
boilerplate,
although
i
would
not
want
the
court
to
go
away
thinking
that
the
commission
held
a
review
other
than
that
a
violation
of
2
(c)
normally
should
result
in
an
order
of
that
scope.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
assuming
that
it
were
not
barred,
that
--
i
hesitate
to
comment
because
i
can't
--
i
would
like
--
i
don't
like
to
say
yes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
when
i
am
not
able
to
think
of
the
circumstances
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
might
be
developed
under
this
theory.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
can't
in
good
conscience
say
that
there
are
other
circumstances
that
might
be
developed.
there
may
well,
i
don't
feel
as
i
--
i'm
well
enough
advised
to
--
advice
the
court
on
that.
there
is
another
reason
mr.
justice
harlan
that
does
suggest
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
thoroughly
appropriate
course.
looking
at
this
problem,
a
problem
of
excessively
broad
orders
in
somewhat
broader
perspective,
i
am
persuaded
at
least
that
if
there
is
a
problem
in
this
area
and
the
communications
were
this
case
several
terms
goes
suggested
there
may
have
sometime
to
be
that
the
place
to
correct
it
is
before
the
agencies
and
that
the
one
--
and
that
is
partly
the
responsible
of
counsel
who
appeared
before
the
agency
because
what
you
are
to
do
is
to
get
the
agencies
to
direct
their
minds
to
this
problem.
and
then
one
of
the
first
ways
to
do
that
is
to
make
sure
that
the
rule
that
the
agency
must
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
is
enforced.
now,
sending
this
back
would
at
least
go
part
way
to
make
sure
that
the
agency
got
the
opportunity.
then
if
the
agency
is
issued
boilerplate,
well
of
course
it's
an
opportunity
for
the
courts
to
step
in.
but
the
thing
has
been
brought
back
to
the
critical
point
and
i
would
think
as
a
matter
of
general
judicial
administration
quite
apart
from
the
peculiarity
of
this
case
that
that
would
be
a
way
of
emphasizing,
that
the
things
must
be
raised
for
the
agency
rather
than
encouraging
counsel
to
drag
out,
especially
a
trade
regulation
proceeding
by
picking
it
up
piecemeal
at
various
stages
as
they
think
of
objection.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
i
think
the
total
dragging
out
overall
that
--
would
be
less
and
if
broch
is
as
good
as
mr.
rowe
says,
he
is
--
isn't
ever
going
to
violate
again,
there'd
be
no
great
harm.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
mean
by
a
petition
for
rehearing?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
my
case
will
be
quite
--
quite
different
then
the
question
would
be
whether
it
was
unreasonable
for
the
agency
to
stand
out
of
proposition
that
you
must
raise
such
a
point
the
first
time,
but
it
would
give
the
agency
all
the
opportunities
to
consider
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
--
that
really
ended
the
sentence.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
black,
maybe
i
misunderstood
him,
he
asked
me
to
consider
a
case
in
which
the
respondent
did
not
object
to
the
scope
of
the
order
at
the
time
the
hearing
officer
made
his
report.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
but
asked
me
to
consider,
asked
me
whether
i
would
be
making
the
same
arguments
here,
if
the
fact
were
that
broch
had
raised
this
question
before
the
commission
in
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
i
said
that
then
i
thought
that
many
of
the
arguments
that
i
made
here
would
not
be
applicable
that
then
would
be
--
i
still
make
the
argument
that
the
interest
of
orderly
administrative
process
required
him
to
conform
to
the
commission's
rule
and
the
commission
adopted
unfair
and
enforcing
its
rules,
but
the
argument
would
have
to
be
somewhat
different.
