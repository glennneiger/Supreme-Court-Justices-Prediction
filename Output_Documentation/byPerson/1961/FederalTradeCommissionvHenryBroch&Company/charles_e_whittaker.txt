justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
--
with
this
court's
opinion
in
the
broch
case
is
not
the
source
of
the
cities
felt
need
to
revise
its
order.
isn't
that
what
--
or
maybe
it
is
that
gave
rise
to
the
need?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
but
the
majority's
opinion
as
i
recall
finally
limited
the
decision
ad
hoc
really
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
a
basis
for
saying
that
one
does
challenge
the
breadth
of
the
order
when
he
challenges
the
whole
order
and
said
you
had
no
authority
to
make
it
at
all?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wonder
if
congress
didn't
make
that
a
function
of
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
when
it
said
it
might
modify
the
order.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
is,
he
may
not
do
so
under
the
order?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
may
he
do
so
under
the
court's
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
looking
at
this
language
on
page
175
of
363
u.s.
this
is
not
to
say
that
every
reduction
in
price
coupled
with
a
reduction
in
brokerage
automatically
compels
the
conclusion
that
an
allowance
to
a
new
brokerage
has
been
granted.
as
the
commission
itself
has
made
clear
for
this
--
such
of
reduction
is
tantamount
to
a
discriminate
--
discriminatory
payment
of
brokerage
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
each
case,
etcetera,
and
there
is
--
i'll
read
you
more
on
that
page
176.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
therefore
i'm
wondering
if
you're
arguing
that
the
order
is
broader
than
our
judgment
(voice
