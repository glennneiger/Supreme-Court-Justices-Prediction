well,
could
it
--
our
remand
went
to
the
--
what
was
the
judgment
of
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
case
went
back,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
only
if
the
case
where
remanded
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
commission,
wouldn't
that
be
true?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
should
i.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
â€“
the
usual
practice
is
--
you
already
told
us
this
but
if
so
i
missed
it,
was
the
--
was
this
point
ever
raised
in
this
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
any
other
case?
justice
potter
stewart
or
wasn't
raised
in
the
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
on
a
petition
for
rehearing
here,
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
raised
then,
was
it
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that
--
isn't
that
argument
gets
you
into
a
bit
of
trouble
because
the
--
you
say
that
the
order
was
an
exact
reflection
of
the
statutory
theory
which
the
commission
followed
and
that
theory
was
affirmed
by
this
court
and
therefore
it
would
affirm
the
reflection
of
the
theory.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
the
meantime,
in
the
meantime,
this
petitioner
will
be
in
contempt
for
actions
which
(voice

the
legality
of
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
yes,
yes.
