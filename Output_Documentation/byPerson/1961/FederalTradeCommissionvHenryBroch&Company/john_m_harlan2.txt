justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
this
point,
there's
no
provision,
general
provision
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question.
this
maybe
entirely
wrong,
but
i
have
dim
recollection
that
at
some
stage
along
the
line
the
federal
trade
commission
act
unlike
the
labor
act
provided
not
for
enforcement
of
the
order,
but
in
effect
for
a
--
of
the
commission's
order
but
in
effect,
the
entry
of
a
new
order,
an
independent
order
by
the
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
was
just
wondering
whether
that
made
any
difference
in
the
scope
of
the
authority
of
the
court
to
modify
the
order
as
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
--
where
is
that
sir?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
sure
whether
you
answered
or
met
the
solicitor
general's
basic
argument
here
that
--
by
comparing
the
rate
as
before
the
commission,
you're
out
of
court.
i
realize
what
you
said
before
that
you
can't
fragmentize
to
two
things,
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
very
persuasive
argument,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
commission
also
argue
alternatively
that
there
was
power
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
that
the
order
should
not
be
modified.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
stood
simply
on
the
so-called
jurisdictional
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
raise
one
more
question?
assuming
that
the
view
should
be
taken
that
the
court
was
not
barred
in
considering
(inaudible)
--
would
you
care
to
comment
on
the
questions
for
whether
there's
any
practical
use
in
sending
this
back
to
the
commission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
could
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
--
can
i
make
this
comment
and
then
see
whether
you
would
think
this
was
unreasonable
comment.
the
commission
has
been
defending
its
order
across
the
board
here,
to
use
a
colloquialism.
it's
done
in
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
stood
on
the
question
of
power,
it's
taking
the
same
position
up
here
through
you
because
you
argued
as
an
alternative
proposition
that
if
there
was
power,
the
order
was
alright.
therefore,
what
practicable
reason
would
there
be
assuming
that
one
would
disagree
with
you
on
the
question
of
power
in
sending
with
com
--
in
sending
the
order
back,
sending
it
both
back?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course,
the
other
side
as
a
dragging
out
is
if
there'd
be
considerable
dragging
out
of
that
conclusion.
that
of
course
is
--
fall
in
this
case.
