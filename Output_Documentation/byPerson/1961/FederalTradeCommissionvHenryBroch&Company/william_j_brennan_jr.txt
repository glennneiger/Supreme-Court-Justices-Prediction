william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
am
sorry.
when
was
it
first
raised?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
get
this
clear
mr.
solicitor,
your
position
here
is
the
same.
it
should
have
been
raised
before
the
commission
even
before
the
order
of
the
commission
order
to
review.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rowe,
do
i
get
this
--
our
remand
was
of
course
that
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
are
you
now
suggesting
that
the
--
that
in
effect
opened
up
the
order
without
regard
to
any
attention
you
may
have
given
to
the
form
of
a
--
when
it
was
before
the
commission
so
that
what
was
done
by
court
of
appeals
to
be
tested
here
without
reference
to
the
prior
history
before
this
but
only
in
respect
of
whether
what
we've
done
was
consistent
with
our
opinion.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
what
i
want
to
get
cleared.
at
least,
you're
arguing
alternatively
that
we
may
set
aside,
ignore
if
you
please,
the
whole
history
of
the
order
up
to
the
time
we
finally
dealt
with
it
here
and
then
remand
it
for
further
proceedings.
that
what
was
then
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
our
remand
by
virtue
of
the
remand
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
in
effect
an
open
order
now
that
we
treat
it
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
one
of
your
grounds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
you're
going
on
--
to
argue
that
in
the
event.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
satisfied
the
requirements.
