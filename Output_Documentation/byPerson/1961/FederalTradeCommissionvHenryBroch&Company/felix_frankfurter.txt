it's
very
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
–
don't
you
think
that
was
a
very
dubious
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
review,
the
order
as
such
--
i
mean
the
scope
of
the
order
wasn't
an
issue
at
all,
and
particularly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
original
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
naturally
enough,
the
federal
trade
commission
didn't
raise
it
and
they
will
contend
the
sweeping
decision
they
had
below.
isn't
that
the
truth
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
thinking
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
giving
debit
and
credit.
i'm
just
saying,
explaining
that
this
question
is
quite
out
of
the
case
when
it
was
new.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
he
was
foreclosed
at
that
point
that
in
as
much
as
this
was
a
broad
to
his
attack,
the
applicability
of
the
statute.
he
couldn't,
if
he
--
well,
if
he
attacks
that
before
the
commission
and
then
came
before
the
court,
he
certainly
weren't
open
for
him
to
raise
that
before
the
board
--
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
should
think
you
just,
do
you
think
he
could
have
raised
it
after
he
had
succeeded
in
his
main
play
that
the
whole
thing
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
if
he
--
he
challenges
the
statutory
applicability
to
this
situation.
he
succeeds
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
everything
what
was
he
concerned
with,
then
he
comes
here
and
losses,
do
you
think
thereafter,
he
couldn't
have
--
that
will
know
that
the
substantive
law
question
is
raised,
i
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
or
nothing
for
him
and
he
went
before
the
court
of
appeals.
his
position
was
all
or
nothing,
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rowe,
i
suppose
when
you
say
a
five-to-four
decision,
you're
stating
a
historic
fact
and
not
any
relevant
element
bearing
on
what
was
really
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
arguing
that
the
--
that
the
order
that
is
sought
here
to
be
sustained
travels
beyond
what
the
court
decided
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
really
arguing
is
that
the
court
below
conformed
to
the
mandate
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
gets
down
to
that
that
what
they
did
was
to
carefully
read,
it's
carefully
framed
in
the
court
opinion
and
then
accommodate
itself
to
its
requirements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
not
your
contention
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rowe,
these
--
the
commission
acted,
would
say
were
inconsistent
with
the
court
decision
in
broch?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
and
this
has
been
taken
since
broch?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
they
--
are
they
referred
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
commission
deal
with
broch?
justice
felix
frankfurter
discusses
broch?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
these
requisites,
mr.
rowe?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
you
say
also,
that's
the
heart
of
the
business,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
requiring
a
few
more
words
on
the
part
of
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rowe,
that's
[inaudible]
this
question,
but
i'm
puzzled
of
the
number
of
cases
to
which
this
is
one
in
which
solid
interest
as
i
assume
the
respondent
here
is,
the
swanee
paper
company
was
that
sizeable
interest,
interest
of
substantive
law
in
substance
represented
presumably
by
competent
counsel
to
lead
that
counsel
to
be
parsimonious
in
the
objection
they
raised
that
they
don't
use
a
second
arrow
and
the
content
of
self
of
a
single
arrow.
how
do
you
account
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
what
transpired
before
the
commission?
there
are
all
these
serious
num
--
quite
a
number
of
cases
of
this
sort,
aren't
they?
and
it
seems
to
be
almost
--
what
shall
i
say
--
a
habit,
if
you
forgive
me
for
repeating,
a
habit
of
parsimonious
objection.
now
that
isn't
usual
tendency
of
the
merit
and
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
saw
the
order
when
they
framed
it
against
your
client,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
didn't
go
on
and
say,
furthermore
this
is
so
isolated
in
instance
--
an
incident
in
our
view
that
the
commission
does
wrong
in
buck
shooting
this
--
in
making
a
comprehensive
universal
of
prohibition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rowe,
will
you
--
please
give
me
some
pleading
information
about
the
power
of
the
commission
to
review
its
order
in
relation
to
the
petition
for
review.
as
i
read
15,
the
59
amendment,
21
(b),
as
i
read
it
and
therefore
i
ask
you
if
i'm
right
about
that,
the
board
asked
the
--
the
commission
section
as
you
deal
generally
with
commissions
and
the
board,
but
the
commission
has
power
from
its
motion
to
reconsider,
do
i
suppose
to
reconsider
it's
order
prior
to
the
finding
of
a
review
in
the
court
of
appeals?
once
a
petition
for
review
is
filed,
i
should
think
the
commission
can't
inject
itself
in
the
situation,
can't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
reading
from.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
remand,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
remand,
but
if
there
is
a
--
but
may
it
--
may
it
take
any
action
after
there
is
a
petition
for
review
filed
during
the
statutory
theories.
do
you
say
yes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
read
it
to
you.
after
the
expiration
at
the
time
allowed
for
filling
a
petition
for
review,
if
no
such
petition
has
been
duly
filed
within
such
time,
the
commission
may
[inaudible].
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
solicitor
general
so
indicated
but
i
--
alright,
if
that's
what
the
statute
--
to
be
construed.
judge
moore
in
the
swanee
case
says,
swanee
did
object
to
that
and
at
the
time
this
was
filed,
the
commission
could
have
modified.
swanee
did
object
to
the
order,
however
in
its
petition
to
review
and
at
the
time
this
was
filed,
the
commission
could've
modified
its
order
if
it
had
so
wished
and
if
[inaudible]
15
u.s.c.a.,
21
(b).
so
i
went
to
15
u.s.c.
21
(b)
but
that
isn't
the
way
i
read
it.
in
reading,
i'll
be
wrong
with
it.
you
tell
me
the
practice
says
--
practically
says
the
opposite
wasn't
what
the
statute
said,
i'll
accept
your
word
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
read
(voice
overlap)
if
that
the
word
--
the
exact
words
were,
after
the
expiration
at
the
time
allowed
for
filling
a
petition
for
review,
after
the
expiration
of
that
time.
if
no
such
petition
has
been
duly
filed
within
such
time,
now
do
they
read
out
the
“if”
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
speaking
for
one
if
i
saw
something
like
that.
i
take
his
words
first
and
i
wouldn't
go
to
the
statute,
but
then
you've
taken
this
or
rather
judge
moore
has
taken
me
to
the
statute,
i
might
say
i'm
(inaudible)
by
having
it
get
some
more
doctrines
upon
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
how
that
wouldn't
--
doesn't
turn
--
determine
this
case
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
all
events,
you're
not
like
the
swanee
case
because
according
to
my
reading
of
it,
in
the
swanee,
there's
an
objection
to
the
order
upon
filing
of
the
petition
for
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
[inaudible]
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
your
objection,
isn't
that
it's
vague,
that
it's
too
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
put
you
to
my
problems
and
then
i'll
leave
you
alone.
one,
would
you
care
to
comment
on
the
repeated
suggestion
by
mr.
rowe
that
these
orders
are
boilerplate,
namely
that
they're
automatic,
mechanical
things,
secondly,
i
invite
your
comments
on
his
comment
on
your
footnote
on
page
31,
namely
that
this
order
put
them
to
jeopardy
in
finding
out
what
is
right
to
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
by
careful
conscientious
businessmen
pursue
restriction
from
doing
business
which
proceedings
may
show
are
not
within
the
contemplation
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
you
cut
down
the
incidents
of
the
applicability
of
what
this
court
had
forbidden
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
carried
out
then
you
necessarily
cut
down
the
area
of
applicability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
at
least
it
will
cut
down
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
at
least,
it
will
cut
down
his
freedom
of
business
action,
so
what
may
turn
out
then
in
a
law
of
freedom
of
action
under
the
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
he
is
doubtful,
he
will
--
a
careful
businessman
or
a
conscientious
businessman
might
(inaudible)
take
a
chance
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
that's
wrong
somewhere
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
can
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
argument
if
i
may,
that
is,
if
the
argument
that
you
made
in
reference
to
an
employer's
anti-union
buyer
to
be
analogized
to
this
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
wouldn't
--
i
didn't
gather
through
your
argument
that
you
thought
that
it
must
be
raised,
how
could
it
be
raised
before
the
hearing
officer?
i
mean
timing
up,
therefore
his
report
comes
to
the
commission.
