mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may,
place
the
issue
in
the
controversy
in
somewhat
broader
perspective
than
the
presentation
just
included
by
the
solicitor
general.
first,
let
me
say
it
is
important
to
realize
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
penalty
but
rather
a
cease-and-desist
order
by
an
administrative
agency
which
mirrors
and
reflects
the
words
of
the
statute.
it
is
highly
synthetic,
we
submit,
to
put
to
one
side
the
order,
put
the
statute
to
the
other
side
and
say,
“you've
only
attacked
the
statute.
you
never
said
anything
about
the
order”
and
then
to
proceed,
as
if
this
proceeding
had
been
conducted
before
the
commission
and
before
the
court
in
a
legal
vacuum.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
cease-and-desist
order
as
entered
by
the
commission
is
the
exact
reflection
of
the
statute
itself
and
that
every
contention
that
was
previously
raised
by
the
respondent
against
the
liability
that
was
adjudged
by
the
commission
was
precisely
applicable
to
the
terms
of
the
order
as
well
because
the
order
is
the
reflection
of
the
statutory
theory
which
the
commission
promulgated
in
this
case
and
which
was
at
issue
in
the
previous
proceedings
on
the
merits
at
the
commission
level
and
before
every
level
of
the
judicial
review.
let
me
say
at
the
onset
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
order
was
a
reflection
of
the
theory
sir,
but
it
went
beyond
what
this
court's
very
narrow
majority
opinion
sanctioned
and
precisely
the
trouble
that
arose
upon
the
remand
as
actuated
by
this
court's
very
narrow
decision
on
the
merits
was
whether
the
order
actually
respected
those
limitations
which
the
court
and
its
majority
opinion
wrote
into
section
2
(c)
or
went
beyond.
now,
the
situation
was
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
accept
this
attack
on
the
order
for
going
beyond
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court,
but
instead
took
another
attack
and
limited
the
order
in
another
respect.
i
might
say
if
the
court
please
that
the
subject
and
the
controversy
over
federal
trade
commission
orders
and
their
meaning
or
their
scope
is
not
a
new
issue
before
this
court.
it
is
a
recurrent
problem
that
has
played
judicial
review
in
this
court,
a
federal
trade
commission
orders
not
less
than
six
times
in
the
last
12
years.
the
problem
with
these
orders
by
the
federal
trade
commission
that
have
been
before
this
court
has
been
compounded
that
in
most
instances
they
have
arisen
out
off
and
have
reflected
the
prohibitions
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
have
inscribed
within
their
restrictive
injunctive
terms,
the
words
of
the
statute
itself
which
have
been
complexed
and
notoriously
obscure
and
animated
interpretations
and
conflicts
such
as
the
one
which
divided
this
court's
decision
in
the
broch
case
by
five
to
four
judgment.
these
orders
as
symptomized
by
the
order
in
the
instant
case
in
effect
present
two
major
facets
of
difficulty.
first
of
course
is
the
problem
of
the
fairness
to
the
respondent
who
is
forced
by
the
cease-and-desist
order
which
merely
reflect
the
terms
of
the
statute
to
fathom
the
meaning
of
the
order
and
to
ascertain
what
it
is
really
that
he
is
prohibited
from
doing
by
the
terms
of
the
order
--
for
the
orders
as
the
order
in
the
instant
case
in
–
in
essential
part
merely
reflects
the
words
of
the
statute
itself
and
does
not
explicate
and
go
on
to
detail
precisely
what
conduct
is
prohibited
apart
from
the
vague
and
difficult
proscription
of
the
statute
itself.
and
the
second
problem
which
is
generated
by
an
order
of
this
kind
as
was
noted
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
in
the
morton
salt
case
in
1948
which
was
the
first
time
one
of
these
orders
created
a
controversy
before
this
court.
the
very
vagueness
and
the
obscurity
of
the
prohibitions
in
the
order
in
effect
cast
on
the
courts
the
responsibility
which
congress
invested
in
the
commission,
namely
of
explicating
what
the
statute
means
and
of
telling
a
respondent
what
it
is
that
he
may
or
may
not
do
under
the
terms
of
the
cease-and-desist
order
entered
by
the
commission.
now,
with
respect
to
the
ochoa
case
which
preceded
the
court's
consideration
of
this
case,
may
i
say
just
two
things?
the
distinction
between
the
ochoa
case,
where
the
respondent
in
effect
was
happy
with
the
order
that
was
issued
by
his
stipulation
and
the
instant
case
which
has
been
in
litigation
for
four
years
as
manifest,
in
that
case,
there
was
complete
consent
between
the
administrative
agency
and
the
labor
union
as
well
as
the
employer
that
the
terms
of
the
order
which
was
being
entered
was
satisfactory
to
both
and
so
that
there
can
be
no
issue
in
relation
to
the
ochoa
case
as
to
whether
any
dictato
fairness
to
the
respondent
was
over
stepped
by
the
action
of
the
labor
board
in
entering
the
order
that
it
did.
the
only
issue
in
the
ochoa
case
as
we
see
it
from
the
argument
which
has
been
presented
the
solicitor
general
is
the
proper
role
of
the
courts
in
relation
to
the
labor
board's
responsibility
in
effectuating
the
national
labor
policy,
the
question
being
whether
the
court
may
in
effect
[inaudible]
itself
into
the
issue
where
the
board
has
made
its
peace
with
the
respondents.
in
that
case
too,
i
understood
from
the
solicitor
general's
brief
that
the
labor
board,
at
least
recently,
has
adopted
the
policy
of
entering
broad
orders
only
in
particular
factual
situations
where
a
broad
cease-and-desist
order
is
warranted
by
the
record.
there
is
no
comparable
policy
disclosed
so
far
as
the
federal
trade
commission
is
concerned
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
one
day
last
year,
the
commission
under
the
very
provisions
of
the
statute
here
at
stake
issued
more
than
40
orders
in
the
broad
language
of
section
2
(c),
the
brokerage
clause
of
the
act
and
addressed
to
trade
practices
by
the
affected
parties
with
all
the
world.
and
this
is
a
type
of
order
which
we
have
here
addressed
to
the
respondent
that
henry
broch
and
company
namely
that
in
effect,
in
the
words
of
section
2
(c),
in
the
words
of
the
brokerage
clause,
he
cease-and-desist
for
the
future
from
violating
section
2
(c).
the
first
part
of
the
order
gives
one
interpretation
of
what
the
commission
conceives
the
brokerage
clause
to
command
and
that
was
the
factual
controversy
before
this
court
namely
that
broch,
not
accept
a
lower
rate
of
commission
at
the
same
time
as
the
seller
reduces
his
price
to
a
buyer.
the
second
part
of
the
order
is
a
general
injunction,
which
declares
and
commands
the
respondent
to
desist
from
violating
the
brokerage
clause
in
any
other
manner
against
anybody
else
at
any
time
in
the
future.
we
respectfully
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
in
view
of
the
facts
and
the
history
of
this
case
as
reflected
in
the
administrative
proceedings
and
particularly
as
reflected
in
the
review
proceedings
which
culminated
in
this
court's
five-to-four
decision
on
the
merits
that
the
commission's
order
goes
far
beyond
the
necessities
of
the
case
and
reflects
a
blanket
prohibition
which
leaves
the
respondent
to
compete
forever
at
his
peril
and
in
effect
shifts
to
the
court
the
commission's
own
responsibility
of
explicating
just
what
it
is
that
the
respondent
is
prohibited
from
doing
by
the
terms
of
the
order
which
has
couched
in
the
vague
and
difficult
statutory
language
of
section
2
(c).
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
no
sir,
i
am
stating
a
status,
the
hard
fact
from
my
view
point
but
it
has
bearing
insofar
as
the
scope
of
the
majority
opinion
defined
the
law
as
applied
by
the
court
of
appeal
on
remand.
so
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned
which
gave
rise
to
this
proceeding
and
there
is
a
no
controversy
about
them
at
this
stage,
they
related
to
an
isolated
transaction
by
the
respondent,
broch,
relating
to
his
dealings
on
behalf
of
one
seller
in
relation
to
one
buyer,
canada
foods.
i
don't
know
what
inferences
were
suggested
in
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general
as
flowing
from
the
record
or
from
this
conduct
as
we
read
the
record
and
the
record
is
perfectly
clear,
the
respondent's
books
and
records
were
investigated
at
great
length
by
the
federal
trade
commission.
he
cooperated
in
the
investigation.
as
a
result
of
this
investigation,
the
commission
and
the
--
and
it
so
testified
on
the
record
of
this
case
decided
that
one
transaction
affecting
one
seller
and
one
buyer
out
of
the
multitude
of
business
transactions
reflected
in
the
respondent's
books
raised
a
legal
question
under
the
act.
the
commission
representative
who
checked
respondent's
books
testified
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
no
other
transaction
raised
any
question
under
the
act
in
his
mind.
he
further
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
on
old
record
sir,
beginning
at
19
and
running
over
to
21.
the
specific
reference
mr.
justice
harlan
is
on
page
21
in
the
middle
paragraph
where
the
witness
testifying
is
mr.
carmichael
who
is
the
assistant
chief
of
the
federal
trade
commission
office
in
chicago.
this
is
on
page
21
of
the
fact
record.
and
in
--
and
mr.
carmichael
stated
in
observing
the
different
invoices
etcetera,
it
appeared
that
throughout
the
year
there
was
no
violation
that
i
could
observe
in
the
case
of
the
different
suppliers
i
examined.
and
mr.
carmichael,
the
commission
representative,
also
testified
that
he
was
shown
by
the
respondent
everything
that
he
wanted
to
see
in
the
course
of
his
investigation.
and
mr.
carmichael,
the
commission
representative
further
testified
that
he
had
interviewed
respondent
at
the
time
the
respondent's
books
were
thrown
open
to
the
commission
and
that
he
was
told
by
the
respondent
that
he
felt
there
was
no
violation
of
the
act.
he
conceded
that
a
violation
of
the
section
until
a
broker's
splitting
his
commission
with
a
customer
or
passing
something
on
directly
to
the
customer
and
the
commission
representative
then
argued
with
the
respondent
and
told
them
that
there
was
a
violation
also
if
there
wasn't
any
payment
directly
by
the
broker,
but
merely
the
broker
had
received
a
smaller
commission
and
the
commission
representative
testified
that
mr.
broch
volunteered
that
he
saw
the
merit
of
this
argument
but
that
it
had
been
his
understanding
previously
that
to
violate
section
2
(c),
there
had
to
be
a
direct
passing
on
and
he
was
violently
against
such
a
practice
etcetera,
etcetera.
and
the
commission
representative
went
to
testify
on
page
20
and
said,
“i
do
not
believe
mr.
broch
felt
he
was
morally
or
legally
guilty
at
all
in
this
particular
transaction
with
smucker.
i
believe
he
thought
he
was
acting
entirely
within
the
so-called
robinson-patman
act.”
the
point
of
my
reference
to
this
commission
testimony
your
honor
is
to
make
perfectly
clear
that
there
is
no
controversy
in
this
case
about
any
scheme
or
any
longstanding
device
or
anything
course
of
conduct
of
brazen
violation
of
the
statute
but
that
what
we
have
in
the
record
at
bar
is
a
unique
and
isolated
transaction
on
the
part
of
this
respondent
who
in
good
faith
believed
as
he
certainly
had
reason
to
believe
in
view
of
what
previously
had
been
a
prevailing
understanding
of
what
the
commission
was
enforcing
in
this
provision
that
he
was
not
violating
the
act
by
the
single
transaction
which
subsequently
became
the
basis
of
the
commission's
charges.
what
is
more,
apart
from
in
effect
the
exoneration
of
the
respondent
of
other
violations
by
the
commission's
representative
as
reflected
in
this
record,
the
commission
in
its
complaint
limited
itself
expressly
to
the
one
arrangement
as
between
the
respondent
here
and
the
particular
seller
and
the
particular
buyer.
the
commission's
complaint
spelled
out
the
respondent's
business
that
he
represented
25
or
more
principals,
but
expressly
confined
itself
in
its
charges
to
the
respondent's
representation
of
canada
foods
and
sales
to
smucker
and
the
particular
commission
arrangements
which
existed
at
that
time,
which
the
commission
challenged
as
violating
section
2
(c).
the
fear
that
might
exist
in
some
other
case
on
another
record,
on
the
basis
of
the
conduct
charge
and
adjudicated
of
future
violations,
we
submit
that
it's
non-existent
in
this
case
and
is
affirmatively
refuted
by
the
evidence
as
reflected
in
the
record.
what
is
more,
again,
as
to
bearing
on
the
good
faith
or
the
proclivity
for
violations
on
the
part
of
this
respondent,
his
belief
that
he
was
acting
within
the
law
was
certainly
temporarily
validated
when
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
finding
of
violation
and
which
was
ultimately
reversed
by
a
five
to
four
decision
by
this
court.
i
might
say
when
the
case
was
before
this
court
on
the
merits,
it
was
subsequently
disclosed
by
one
of
the
federal
trade
commissioners
that
the
department
of
justice
or
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
had
recommended
that
no
review
be
sought
here
because
it
considered
the
federal
trade
commission
theory
erroneous
and
that
the
case
nevertheless
was
taken
before
this
court
by
the
solicitor
general
who
as
the
court
may
recall,
declined
to
take
a
position
on
the
merits
before
this
court
and
in
effect
merely
stated
that
he
was
presenting
the
commission's
arguments.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
relevant
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
relevance
of
that
your
honor
is
not
in
terms
of
what
positions
the
government
intramurally
took
but
rather
this
that
when
the
case
was
finally
decided
by
this
court
on
the
merits,
the
majority
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
was
a
very
carefully,
narrowly
framed
majority
opinion
which
limited
section
2
(c)
very
carefully
to
the
particular
facts
at
bar
and
to
the
particular
issue
at
controversy
with
express
reservations
of
other
theories
of
section
2
(c)
interpretation
which
this
court
in
its
majority
opinion
declined
to
reach
and
declined
to
condemn.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
precisely
sir
which
is
the
reason,
the
basic
reason
for
the
challenge
by
the
respondent
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
in
order
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
confine
the
order
within
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
perhaps
the
reason
for
stating
that
is
once
again
to
indicate
the
closeness
of
the
case,
the
difficulty
of
ascertaining
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
violation
involved
in
relation
to
the
respondent's
alleged
proclivity
for
misconduct
on
the
one
hand
and
also
as
responsible
perhaps,
and
we
can
only
speculate,
responsible
for
the
very
narrow
compass
of
the
majority
opinion
which
was
issued
on
the
basis
of
the
decision
on
the
merits
by
this
court
as
subsequently
reflected
in
the
order.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
we
certainly
arguing
mr.
justice
frankfurter
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
on
remand,
the
order
be
conformed
with
this
court's
decision
on
the
merit
and
mandate.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
accept
our
number
one
argument.
the
court
of
appeals
went
off
on
another
point.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
that
was
our
contention
before
the
court
and
i
believe
the
court's
judgement
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes,
it
is.
it
is
and
that
was
the
point
we
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
relation
to
the
majority
opinion
and
the
law
of
the
case
in
effect
as
declared
by
this
court.
to
be
specific,
in
several
places,
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
laid
great
stress
on
the
necessity
of
having
a
discrimination
in
favor
of
particular
buyers
in
order
to
constitute
a
violation
of
section
2
(c)
within
the
meaning
of
the
majority
opinion.
the
court
twice
pointed
out
that
the
vice
of
the
transaction
in
effect
was
the
reduction
of
the
commission
by
this
broker
to
commit
the
seller
and
the
broker
to
get
a
particular
order
from
a
buyer
out
of
a
discriminatory
price.
secondly,
the
majority
opinion
very
carefully
reserved
and
pointed
out
the
fact
that
in
this
case
the
buyer
was
not
shown
who
have
rendered
any
services
or
engaged
in
any
business
methods
which
were
deserving
of
recognition
in
the
form
of
a
lower
price
by
the
seller.
and
after
the
decision
by
this
court
and
upon
the
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
these
two
points
which
the
respondent
expressed
before
the
court
of
appeals
as
being
in
effect
defeated
by
the
commission's
blanket
prohibition
couched
in
the
language
of
section
2
(c)
which
did
not
require
any
presence
of
discrimination
which
in
effect
would
prohibit
conduct
not
discriminatory.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
that
is
part
of
it
mr.
justice
brennan
because
as
we
will
go
on
to
detail,
there
were
challenges
to
the
premises
of
the
order
and
there
will
be
of
course
some
question
about
whether
the
challenge
was
specific
on
our
part
before
the
court
of
appeals
the
first
time
around
and
before
the
commission
the
first
time
around.
however,
we
do
say
that
even
apart
from
how
precisely
or
specifically
our
challenge
was
the
first
time
around,
the
majority
decision
of
this
court
declared
the
law
of
the
case
at
that
time
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
oh
but
the
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
with
the
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes
sir,
that
there
were
challenges
a
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
--
a
prior
requirement.
that
satisfied
the
requirements
at
least
in
the
context
of
the
overall
proceeding
as
it
developed.
as
i
have
stated,
when
the
respondent
upon
the
remand
from
this
court
addressed
himself
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
sought
action
by
the
court
in
light
of
the
decision
pursuant
to
the
remand,
the
respondent
pointed
out
that
withstanding
the
careful
limitations
of
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court,
the
order
was
a
blanket
prohibition
which
in
effect
penalized
conduct
by
the
respondent
which
was
carefully
carved
out
by
the
limitations
of
the
majority
opinion
and
hence
in
effect
defeated
the
narrow
limitations
and
the
assurances
which
the
petitioner
drew
from
the
majority
opinion
as
it
was
finally
framed
and
handed
down.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
pointed
out
that
the
majority
opinion
stated
that
there
was
nothing
at
bar
at
the
time
which
indicated
that
the
buyer
rendered
any
services
for
which
he
might
be
complicated
in
a
form
of
a
lower
price.
this
very
reservation
of
a
situation
where
services
were
rendered
was
defeated
by
the
terms
of
the
order
which
cut
out,
which
excised
from
the
language
of
the
statute
which
the
order
in
effect
mirrored
which
cut
out
from
that
the
reservation
of
payments
made
for
services
rendered
and
so,
so
far
as
the
text
of
the
order
is
concerned,
even
though
services
were
rendered
which
according
to
the
majority
opinion
might
justify
a
lower
price
to
the
buyer,
that
would
not,
according
to
the
terms
of
the
order,
be
a
justification
for
the
price
reduction.
let
me
state
the
impact
of
that
order
on
the
business
of
the
respondent
in
its
present
form.
so
far
as
the
order
is
concerned,
this
respondent
cannot
lower
his
commission
fees
in
order
to
permit
a
seller
to
make
a
sale
to
a
buyer
at
a
lower
price
which
is
forwarded
simultaneously
with
his
fee
deduction.
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
where
the
respondent
represents
25
seller
principals,
this
means
that
the
seller
principal
can
lower
his
price
and
lower
a
broker's
commission
by
simply
going
to
someone
else.
he
can
make
such
an
arrangement
with
another
broker
so
long
as
the
basic
price
is
justifiable
under
the
statute.
and
yet,
this
respondent,
subject
to
the
terms
of
the
order
as
drafted
by
the
commission
cannot
reduce
his
own
commission
in
order
to
accommodate
himself
to
such
a
situation
and
in
effect
must
give
up
that
business
in
a
circumstance
of
that
time.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
he
may
not
do
so
under
the
order.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
as
we
read
the
court's
judgment
mr.
justice
whittaker
of
the
majority
opinion
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
--
we
stopped
at
the
reservation
that
the
particular
price
reduction
by
the
seller
was
made
in
order
to
get
a
particular
contract
to
favor
a
buyer
who
was
not
shown
by
services
or
otherwise
to
have
deserved
the
lower
price.
in
the
situation
which
i
posit,
i
have
assumed
that
the
buyer
was
deserving
of
a
lower
price
and
that
such
as
a
lower
price
was
available
to
him
under
the
statute
and
yet
under
the
order,
the
respondent
is
barred
from
accepting
a
lower
commission
in
that
situation.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
precisely
your
honor
because
under
the
opinion,
the
broker
may
well
do
this
legitimately
and
yet,
those
assurances
of
the
majority
opinion
are
defeated
by
the
order
which
says,
“without
qualification
and
without
regard
to
particular
facts
and
circumstances
that
the
broker
may
not
accept
a
smaller
commission
when
the
seller
lowers
its
price
to
the
buyer.”
and
to
that
extent,
among
other
points,
the
order
goes
beyond
what
this
court
approved
in
the
majority
opinion
as
being
a
boundary
upon
the
liability
established
by
section
2
(c).
what
is
more
as
i
--
to
illustrate
another
aspect
where
the
order
goes
beyond
what
the
court
approved
as
we
read
it,
we
do
not
see
in
the
majority
opinion
any
disapproval
of
the
practice
whereby
the
broker
makes
a
permanent
arrangement
to
accept,
like
stock
brokers
do,
a
lower
commission
rate
on
larger
transactions
because
the
majority
opinion
carefully
points
out
that
it
is
a
discrimination
made
to
get
a
particular
order
which
is
the
vice
of
the
transaction.
yet
so
far
as
the
cease-and-desist
order
is
concerned,
the
respondent
is
foreclosed
and
is
prohibited
from
entering
into
a
permanent
arrangement
whereby
he
would,
like
stock
brokers
do,
accept
a
smaller
rate
of
commission
on
more
economical
larger
transactions.
and
i
have
pointed
out
where
the
court's
majority
opinion
stressed
the
element
of
services
rendered
which
were
absent
in
the
case
when
it
was
here
on
the
merits,
and
yet
so
far
as
the
order
is
concerned,
the
presence
of
these
services
would
not
nevertheless
leave
the
respondent
in
violation
of
the
blanket
prohibition.
in
short,
because
the
order
goes
beyond
the
law
as
declared
by
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court,
the
respondent
at
that
stage
felt,
at
least
justified
that
the
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
before
the
commission
upon
remand
of
this
court's
decision
which
after
all
was
the
first
interpretation
in
the
history
of
section
2
(c)
by
this
court
was
an
issue
which
the
court
of
appeals
could
consider
and
would
certainly
the
federal
trade
commission
could
consider
at
that
stage
since
the
law
of
section
2
(c)
as
declared
by
this
court
in
its
majority
opinion
of
1960
was
certainly
not
precisely
the
law
as
it
was
understood
prior
to
that
majority
decision
in
1960.
i
think
what
we
have
pointed
out
about
the
orders
being
in
an
excess
of
a
judgment
of
this
court
which
codified
the
majority
opinion
is
borne
out
and
corroborated
by
the
fact
that
the
commission's
brief
before
this
court
now,
in
effect
gives
belated
assurances
that
the
order
doesn't
really
mean
what
it
says
in
so
many
words.
for
example
at
page
30
of
the
commission's
brief
in
a
footnote,
the
commission
takes
on
these
points
which
petitioner
has
raised
with
respect
to
the
order
and
the
footnote
goes
on
to
say
well,
“the
order
must
be
read
in
relation
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
hence,
it's
not
a
blanket
prohibition”
and
the
footnote
goes
on
to
explain
when
we
say
that
notwithstanding
services
rendered
by
the
buyer,
the
broker
would
still
be
violating
the
order.
to
that
we
brief
in
the
footnote
response,
there
is
nothing
in
the
order
that
such
circumstances
would
not
be
considered
if
the
proper
case
and
if
the
proper
occasion
arose.
we
respectfully
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
now
or
when
the
case
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
proper
occasion
to
state
what
the
order
meant
and
not
in
a
footnote
to
the
commission's
brief
which
gives
assurances
to
the
respondent
that
in
effect
he
shouldn't
really
worry
about
what
the
order
says
because
when
the
proper
time
comes,
it
might
not
really
be
so
prohibited
and
so
blanket
in
its
prohibition
as
the
text
of
the
order
promulgates.
indeed
the
very
assurances
in
the
footnote
of
the
commission's
brief
that
the
order
doesn't
really
constitute
this
kind
of
blanker
prohibition,
these
very
assurances
are
refuted
by
current
precedence
of
the
federal
trade
commission
which
take
the
position,
notwithstanding
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court,
in
this
case,
on
the
merit
that
you
really
don't
have
to
have
any
discrimination
in
order
to
have
a
violation
of
section
2
(c).
and
which
also
takes
the
position
that
services
performed
by
a
buyer
are
irrelevant
and
immaterial
as
a
matter
of
law
in
a
proceeding
alleging
a
violation
of
section
2
(c),
the
so-called
brokerage
clause.
and
in
view
of
this
current
commission
precedence,
which
in
effect
dispelled
the
footnote
assurances
in
the
footnote
of
the
commission's
brief
before
this
court,
we
feel
justified
in
taking
the
position
that
not
only
does
the
order
literally
go
beyond
the
judgment
of
this
court,
if
the
judgment
reflects
the
majority
opinion
and
its
limitations,
but
that
--
these
limitations
and
that
this
blanket
prohibition
in
the
order
is
not
qualified
by
any
extraneous
consideration
or
any
extraneous
assurances
which
the
commission
now
tenders
in
a
footnote
to
its
brief
before
this
court
to
the
effect
that
the
order
does
not
really
mean
what
it
says.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
this
has
been
taken
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
commission
deals
with
broch
as
i
see
it
in
a
rather
equivocal
way.
the
commission
cites
broch
in
a
situation,
which
approximate
the
factual
pattern
of
broch.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
but
does
not
apply
the
rationale
of
--
when
it
takes
the
position
as
it
did,
for
example
in
the
venus
foods
case
which
we
have
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
on
page
15,
we
have
cited
the
venus
foods
case,
page
15
of
our
brief.
in
that
case,
the
commission
took
the
position
that
discrimination
was
irrelevant
to
the
existence
of
a
violation
of
section
2
(c)
of
the
brokerage
clause.
i
believe,
although
i'm
not
sure
that
the
case
is
pending
in
the
channels
of
judicial
review
but
i
could
not
say
that
for
a
fact.
however,
that
was
the
rationale
of
the
venus
foods
case
that
discrimination
is
irrelevant
and
so
once
again,
the
assurances
that
are
contained
in
the
footnote
of
the
commission's
brief
that
perhaps
services
if
properly
rendered
would
be
considered,
although
it
doesn't
say
that
much.
it
just
said
there's
nothing
in
the
order
that
says
it
wouldn't
be
considered,
we
believe
that
are
vitiated
by
the
current
course
of
commission
precedence
which
do
not
regard
and
do
not
give
it
--
include
considerations
which
were
carved
out
by
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court.
i
might
say
that
the
very
necessity
for
the
ad
hoc
interpretation
in
effect
by
the
commission
of
its
order
and
its
brief
before
this
court
points
out
the
vice
of
this
kind
of
bifocal
order
where
the
commission
in
effect
throws
the
statute
at
the
respondent
and
says,
“do
not
violate
the
statute
anymore”
and
at
that
point,
the
matter
is
left
up
to
the
court
in
review
proceedings
to
really
fathom
what
the
terms
of
the
prohibition
are.
this
was
the
issue
before
this
court
in
1948
in
the
morton
salt
case
where
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
and
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
in
respect
to
one
aspect
of
the
order
that
the
order
was
conditional.
it
wasn't
open-ended
order
and
mr.
justice
black's
majority
opinion
pointed
out
that
this
type
of
thing
where
the
commission
leaves
an
order
open
in
effect
shifts
to
the
courts
the
responsibility
in
subsequent
proceedings
to
explicate
the
law
which
actually
is
the
responsibility
of
the
agency
itself.
and
i
might
say
the
morton
salt
decision
has
been
followed
within
the
recent
few
months
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
also
modified
a
federal
trade
commission
cease-and-desist
order
similar
to
the
broch
case.
in
that
case,
the
unanimous
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
the
swanee
paper
decision
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
said,
“we
disapprove
of
the
practice
where
the
commission
in
effect
throws
the
statute
at
the
respondent
and
at
the
court
and
leave
--
leaves
them
to
figure
out
what
meaning
is.”
and
by
reference
to
this
court's
morton
salt
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
swanee
paper
case
also
modified
a
federal
trade
commission
order,
in
that
case,
not
by
cutting
it
down
to
effect
particular
parties
only
but
rather
cutting
it
down,
you
might
say
horizontally
by
reducing
its
scope
so
as
to
reach
only
the
particular
type
of
trade
practice
which
had
been
adjudicated
before
the
commission
on
the
merits
rather
than
the
whole
statutory
prohibition
which
can
include
a
multitude
of
different
types
of
conduct.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i'm
coming
to
that
sir
and
i
would
like
to
explicate
that
in
some
detail
also.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
it
is
the
heart
of
the
business
your
honor
but
i
feel
i
should
outline
the
history
of
the
proceedings
before
exposing
what
the
nub
of
the
case
is
from
the
jurisdictional
point
of
view.
perhaps
related
to
the
question
and
i
will
come
to
the
jurisdictional
question
of
the
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
very
well
sir.
in
relation
to
the
relationship
of
the
courts
and
the
agency
and
that
is
the
jurisdictional
issue,
namely
what
is
the
proper
role
of
the
agency
and
what
is
the
proper
role
of
the
reviewing
court
on
review
of
an
administrative
cease-and-desist
order?
that
is
the
jurisdictional
issue.
collateral
to
that
is
the
question
really
of
whether
the
commission
by
issuing
blanket
or
boilerplate
orders
in
effect
shifts
to
the
court
its
own
responsibility
of
expertise
of
framing
orders
based
on
its
expert
administration
of
the
statute
and
based
on
its
expert
assessment
of
the
competitive
practices
reflected
by
the
record.
we
think,
and
again,
i
shall
go
on
to
detail
that
--
that
it
ill
behooves
the
commission
to
lay
such
exclusive
stress
on
its
right
and
on
its
power
and
on
its
prerogative
to
issue
these
orders
on
the
basis
of
its
expertise
when
in
effect
the
order
is
no
more
than
a
boilerplate
version
of
the
statute
that
shifts
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
meaning
of
the
prohibition
which
the
order
incorporates.
now
as
to
the
more
specific
jurisdictional
point
which
has
been
described
in
the
commission's
brief
by
reference
to
the
principle
of
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy,
the
point
that
the
petitioner
or
the
respondent
on
this
case
in
effect
didn't
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
and
more
or
less
comes
in
here
as
an
afterthought,
after
midnight
with
their
point
which
no
one
every
dreamed
really
existed
in
this
case.
in
regard
to
that,
as
i
started
out
by
saying,
it
must
realized
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
situation
where
we
can
separate
the
liability
from
the
judgment.
it's
not
a
matter
of
saying,
“well,
we
might
have
been
liable,
but
the
penalty
is
too
high,
$50,000
is
too
much”
and
whereby
then
someone
could
say,
“well,
you
should
have
thought
of
that
sooner.”
the
order
in
this
case
is
virtually
in
paragraph
2,
a
verbatim
copy
of
the
statutory
provision.
right
from
the
outset,
from
the
fact
--
from
the
time
that
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
respondent
resisted
that
allegation
and
resisted
that
theory
which
culminated
in
the
commission's
judgment
as
reflected
in
its
order.
the
respondent
contested
liability
when
the
issue
was
in
hearing
before
the
trial
examiner
of
the
commission.
the
respondent
stated
that
as
a
matter
law,
the
acceptance
of
a
lower
rate
of
commission
by
a
broker
at
the
time
the
seller
got
a
lower
price
was
not
an
offense
against
section
2
(c).
precisely
that
is
what
the
order
says.
perhaps
the
respondent
could've
drawn
a
picture
before
the
examiner
and
said,
“we
are
attacking
this
theory
of
the
commission,
not
only
as
respects
the
liability
but
we're
attacking
the
same
thing
as
respects
the
order.”
perhaps
in
retrospect
that
would
have
been
the
more
cautious
thing
to
do.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
however,
that
my
contesting
the
liability
before
the
examiner
and
before
the
commission
as
reflected
in
the
order,
the
respondent
in
effect
contested
--
he
reflects
on
that
liability
in
the
cease-and-desist
order.
what
is
more
again
in
relation
to
the
principle
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
which
is
a
sound
principle
and
there
is
controversy
about
that
here.
we
understand
that
principle
to
be
not
a
boggy
or
a
quibble
but
a
reasonable
instrument
for
ensuring
that
the
agency
gets
a
first
crack
at
the
issue
which
ultimately
goes
before
the
court
so
that
the
agency
can
apply
its
expertise
to
the
problem
and
can
avert
errors
before
there
is
any
necessity
for
the
court
to
get
in
to
the
picture.
there
is
no
controversy
about
that
aim
of
the
principle
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
it
here.
we
think
the
counterpart
of
that
principle
is
that
a
respondent
should
not
lay
back
or
hold
back
and
wait
till
midnight
before
he
comes
up
with
a
legal
argument
which
defeats
all
of
the
previous
administrative
proceedings
if
he
thinks
of
it
for
the
first
time
before
the
court.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
first
of
all,
when
we
came
before
the
court
of
appeal
the
first
time
around,
the
respondent
did
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
one
answer
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
a
god
or
an
adequate
answer
sir
is
that
before
the
commission,
the
practice
of
exceptions
did
not
exist
at
the
time
this
case
was
before
the
commission.
all
that
the
commission
required
was
a
statement
of
questions
involved
and
to
be
argued
on
the
appeal.
it
wasn't
a
matter
of
detailing
point
per
point
where
the
care
and
caution
of
the
responsible
counsel
could
then
--
could
come
into
play
to
be
complete.
it
wasn't
that
kind
of
thing
at
all
but
rather
a
statement
of
the
questions
involved
and
to
be
argued.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
we
saw
the
order
and
we
attacked
the
premises
of
the
order
and
each
ramification.
we
said
that
this
is
an
isolated
transaction
of
[inaudible].
it
does
not
warrant
a
commission
proceeding
in
the
public
interest
to
single
out
a
particular
transaction
on
the
part
of
this
respondent.
we
also
said
that
there's
no
violation
for
a
respondent
broker
who
accepts
a
lower
rate
of
commission
to
facilitate
the
reduction
in
price
by
the
seller
to
the
buyer.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
commission
your
honor
had
been
buck
shooting
in
this
area
for
some
years.
perhaps
in
retrospect,
it
might
have
been
more
imaginative,
more
cautious,
more
prudent
to
have
added
on
to
the
list
but
certainly
at
the
time
and
certainly
before
this
court's
decision
on
the
merits
in
this
case,
it
would
have
been
a
--
in
our
view,
a
feudal
gesture.
it
is
when
this
court
decided
this
case
on
the
merits,
when
section
2
(c)
was
interpreted
by
this
court
for
the
first
time
and
the
fashion
that
it
was
interpreted
that
it
was
not
a
matter
of
the
commission
being
completely
wrong
on
liability
which
we
certainly
thought
and
in
retrospect,
we
are
sorry
that
we
thought
was
an
evident
only
then
when
the
law
was
narrowed
by
the
majority
opinion.
it
became
clear
that
apart
from
what
the
statute
now
meant,
the
order
went
beyond
the
judgment
of
the
court
because
of
the
court
in
its
first
interpretation
of
section
2
(c)
had
construed
the
statute
to
be
of
a
narrower
import
than
the
commission's
order.
before
that,
the
order
was
the
same
as
the
statute,
only
then
was
the
order
larger
than
the
statute.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
well,
mr.
justice,
before
the
court
of
appeals,
we
did
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
commission's
order
was
vague,
exceeded
the
language
of
section
2
(c)
and
controvert
--
and
it
was
in
conflict
with
the
sherman
act.
we
stated
that
in
our
bill
of
exceptions
in
effect
before
the
court
of
appeals,
but
certainly
the
brunt
of
the
attack
is
and
was
that
the
commission
at
that
time
had
interpreted
the
statute
in
excess
of
the
congressional
language
and
purpose.
and
the
order
merely
doing
the
same
thing,
we
certainly
felt
was
not
a
separate
ground
of
challenge
except
as
we
did
list
it
in
our
list
of
exceptions,
but
rather
that
the
arguments
so
far
as
the
order
was
concerned
was
included
and
was
subsumed
within
the
argument
addressed
to
liability
which
at
that
time
was
the
same
as
the
order.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
can
only
speculate
as
the
solicitor
general
did
but
perhaps
i
can
speculate
a
little
better
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
did
not
give
petitioner
the
relief
which
the
petitioner
had
asked
for.
we
asked
for
a
complete
setting
aside
of
the
commission's
order
and
then
went
on
to
argue
that
apart
from
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
as
giving
effect
to
its
majority
opinion
was
an
independent
reason
for
limiting
the
order
and
so
perhaps
since
the
court
didn't
want
to
give
us
complete
relief,
it
gave
us
what
relief
it
did
give
on
its
own
motion.
i
have
no
other
explanation
than
this.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
that's
what
he's
saying.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
no
sir.
i
treat
the
fact
of
the
court's
acting
sua
sponte
to
not
create
any
significant
difference
for
purposes
of
this
court.
it
could
have
done
it
by
granting
in
part
the
respondent's
relief
rather
than
denying
it
in
its
entirety
and
then
coming
up
with
some
relief
of
its
own.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
we
didn't
reargue
the
merits.
we
did
say,
and
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
which
met
some
of
the
qualifications
expressed
in
this
court's
majority
opinion.
we
were
--
the
commission
said
we
were
rearguing
the
merits
but
i
think
that's
argument.
the
scope
of
the
order
was
the
principle
thing.
we
requested
that
the
order
be
set
aside
or
limited
in
relation
to
the
majority
opinion.
i
might
also
say
this
coming
back
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
point,
whether
the
principle
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
was
in
this
case
satisfied
or
flouted.
as
i
understand
the
principle,
it
is
that
the
agency
had
a
fair
chance
to
pass
on
the
issue
before
it
gets
to
the
court.
now
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
not
only
an
admission,
an
express
admission
by
the
commission
in
its
brief
that
it
did
consider
the
scope
of
its
order,
which
i
should
think
would
be
satisfying
the
point
that
it
didn't
have
a
chance,
but
in
addition,
the
commission
declined
on
two
occasions,
further
opportunities
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
remand
to
reconsider
its
order.
and
so
if
the
point
of
the
principle
is
that
the
agency
not
to
be
ambushed
by
a
surprising
legal
development
which
it
did
not
have
a
chance
to
consider,
certainly
in
this
case,
the
point
is
met
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
admittedly
did
consider
the
scope
of
its
order
in
light
of
the
evidence
and
number
two,
when
it
again
was
given
opportunities
before
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
order,
it
declined
these
opportunities.
and
i
would
like
to
refer
briefly
to
our
motion
before
the
court
of
appeals
because
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
in
his
argument
might
not
had
done
complete
justice
to
what
the
opportunity
was
that
the
commission
had.
we
stated
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
is
at
the
page
49
of
the
new
record,
the
small
record,
if
the
court
should
conclude
that
the
issues
tendered
by
petitioner
were
non-sufficiently
explored
by
the
commission
at
the
administrative
level,
the
proper
course
would
be
to
remand
to
the
commission
for
further
appropriate
consideration
rather
than
to
foreclose
all
opportunity
for
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
the
reason
we
said
that
your
honor
was
that
when
it
was
suggested
that
one
alternative
way
to
proceed
was
to
remand
for
further
commission
consideration.
the
commission
came
in
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
said,
“the
court
has
no
power
to
consider
this
issue.
it
is
all
closed
because
the
petitioner
didn't
raise
it
the
first
time
around
at
the
administrative
level”
and
it
was
in
response
to
that
argument
by
the
commission
namely
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
power
to
look
at
the
order
at
this
stage
that
we
came
forth
and
suggested,
“well,
if
this
is
so,
if
the
commission
itself
wants
to
consider
the
orders
or
more
in
light
of
the
majority
decision
here,
it
should
do
so.”
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
no
sir.
the
commission
had
no
time
before
the
court
of
appeals
defended
the
order
on
the
merits.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
they
stood
on
the
jurisdictional
ground,
yes
sir
and
so
actually,
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
views
of
the
commission
as
to
the
merit
before
it
at
the
time
he'd
made
his
modification.
and
one
additional
point
i
would
like
to
mention
in
that
connection,
the
commission
at
no
point
petitioned
the
court
of
appeals
for
reconsideration
that
its
order
was
modified.
to
be
sure,
the
order
of
the
court
is
rather
naked
and
delphic,
it
doesn't
have
any
opinion
attached
to
it
and
we
are
left
to
speculate
as
to
the
whys
and
wherefores.
but
unlike
the
labor
board
which
in
the
ochoa
case
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
secured
from
the
court
of
appeals
an
elucidation
and
an
explication
of
its
action,
the
federal
trade
commission
in
this
case
stood
fast
for
the
second
time.
and
so
what
is
before
this
court
is
necessarily
a
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
a
federal
trade
commission
explication
as
to
its
order.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
first
explication
by
the
commission
for
its
order
is
in
the
footnote
of
the
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
for
the
commission
before
this
court
in
which
we
are
sure
that
the
order
isn't
really
as
broad
as
the
text
that
might
dictate
because
some
of
these
other
considerations
might
be
taken
into
account
at
a
later
date.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
believe
i
have
an
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
that,
the
new
amendment
of
the
clayton
act
in
1959
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
--
makes
that
act
synonymous
with
what
the
federal
trade
commission
act
was
previously
and
that
act
has
been
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
to
the
effect
that
the
commission
upon
remand
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
--
upon
a
conclusion
of
--
of
a
review
proceeding
may
modify
its
order.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
it
may
and
it
has
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
commission
in
several
cases
during
the
pendency
of
judicial
review
voluntarily
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
even
before
this
court
modified
its
order
by,
you
might
say
voluntary
consent,
before
the
court,
during
the
pendency
of
the
case.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
if
your
honor
please,
without
having
the
exact
word
of
the
statute
before
me,
the
commission
before
the
courts
of
appeals
and
before
this
court
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
perhaps
the
solution
lies
in
what
the
word
modify
means.
perhaps
when
the
commission
comes
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
says,
“we
drop
this
part
of
this
order.”
that
isn't
the
modification
and
perhaps
that
maybe
the
answer
to
the
riddle
because
in
a
number
of
cases,
we
have
cited
some
in
our
footnote
the
commission
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
as
the
matter
of
fact,
before
this
court
only
three
years
ago
in
the
standard
oil
case
by
virtue
of
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
said,
“we
don't
want
this
part
of
the
order
anymore.
we
abandon
it”
and
in
effect,
that
works
the
modification
without
being
so
and
(inaudible).
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
after
this
stage
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
related
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
no
sir,
it
does
not
but
i
believe
it
points
out
that
the
commission
even
at
this
stage,
at
this
very
moment,
before
this
court
as
in
other
cases
if
it
were
inclined
to
do
so
could
modify
its
order
and
could
concede
that
part
of
its
order
was
not
valid
in
reference
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
on
this
record.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
as
in
--
in
our
case
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
upon
our
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
even
on
the
first
petition,
the
respondent
pointed
out
and
this
is
at
page
14
of
the
record,
the
order
of
the
commission
is
defective
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
fact
record
sir,
page
214
of
the
fact
at
the
very
bottom,
number
7.
the
order
of
the
commission
is
defective
and
that
it
is
vague,
exceeds
the
statutory
limits
of
section
2
(c)
and
is
applied
with
conflict
with
the
sherman
act.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
our
points
are
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
it
exceeded
the
limits
of
section
2
(c)
and
certainly
when
this
court's
majority
opinion
confined
the
limit
of
section
2
(c).
at
that
point,
the
breadth
of
the
order
which
went
beyond
what
the
majority
opinion
construed
section
2
(c)
to
be
was
the
principal
basis
for
our
challenge
before
the
court
of
appeals.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
this
and
this
is
perhaps
a
very
general
statement
but
--
of
applicability
to
cases
as
symptomized
by
the
instant
case.
the
federal
trade
commission
has
been
invested
with
tremendous
responsibilities
by
the
congress
to
regulate
the
area
of
competitive
practices
and
has
belonged
in
the
application
of
these
statutes
best
in
the
expertise
which
has
been
conceded
to

courts.
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
does
no
honor
to
the
commission's
expertise
to
issue
boilerplate
orders
in
the
words
of
the
statute
and
leave
the
respondent
in
the
dark
as
to
their
meaning
and
in
effect
shift
to
the
reviewing
courts
the
task
of
fathoming
the
meaning
of
the
order
in
the
context
of
review
and
enforcement
proceedings.
