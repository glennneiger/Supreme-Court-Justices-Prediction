what
is
the
relevance
of
that
namely?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
start
counting
judges,
you
had
more
judges
on
your
side
than
the
government
did.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
understand
the
argument,
but
i
don't
understand
the
argument
that
department
justice
had
trouble
making
up
his
mind
whether
to
take
review
or
to
seek
review.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
will
suppose
that
the
only
issue
left
open
by
our
decision
with
the
scope
of
the
decree.
did
you
reargue
the
merits
down
there
on
remand?
