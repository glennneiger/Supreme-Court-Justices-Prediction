justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
regulation,
as
i
understand
it,
merely
required
the
partner
director
to
report
to
the
commission
his
share
in
this
transaction.
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
problem
--
this
is
the
problem.
that's
the
prior
rule
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
exactly?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
say
appointed?
is
that
the
way
it's
done?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
i
see.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please,
did
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
you
consider
it
vital
to
your
case
that
we
consider
director
to
include
partnership
as
the
form
of
word
is
used
in
16
(b)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
suppose
that
a
partner
actually,
beneficially
interested,
had
such
equity
securities
taking
the
names
of
other
people.
it'd
still
be
his
transaction
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
now,
suppose
he
had
a
piece
of
it
and
somebody
else
had
a
balance,
would
it
be
different?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
would
all
be
directors?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
seymour,
are
those
findings
challenged
here
in
any
way
by
either
the
government
or
blau?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
can
you
enlighten
us?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
we
deciding,
if
i'm
quite
clear
of
my
thinking,
that
even
though
mr.
thomas
is
the
new
director
and
he
had
inside
information
in
the
past,
he
makes
a
deal
or
one
is
made
by
his
agents
or
his
principals,
that
it's
tainted
only
to
the
extent
of
his
participation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
though
it
was
as
a
general
partnership?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
gets
back
to
these
findings?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
going
to
discuss
that
later
when
you
get
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
part
of
--
is
it
part
of
their
business
to
serve
one
director?
i
hope
it's
in
the
record,
the
statement
--
rather,
approximately
100
directorates
are
filled
by
these
partners.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
part
of
their
business?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
please
sir,
at
that
point,
what
interest
did
lehman
brothers
have
in
tide
water
to
be
represented
at
the
time
that
the
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but,
they
bought
this
certain
types
of
shares
of
stock
afterwards?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
are
you
arguing
that
remedy
here
is
controlled
by
something
other
than
that
statute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
this
statute
allow
to
create
a
remedy
conversely
against
anyone
other
than
the
beneficial
partner,
officer,
or
director
of
the
issuer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wasn't
this
to
say
you
should
be
liable
for
the
profit
realized
by
him?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
does
that
mean
by
him
and
somebody
else?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
the
law
--
under
your
partnership
law,
this
is
something
that's
--
the
theory
that
each
partner
owns
it
all
and
he
belongs
to
the
