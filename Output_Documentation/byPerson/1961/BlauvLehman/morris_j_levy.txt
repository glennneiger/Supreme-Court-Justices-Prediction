mr.
morris
j.
levy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
presently
before
this
court
pursuant
to
its
order
which
granted
petitioner's
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
affirmed,
by
divided
court,
the
trial
court
judgment,
dismissing
the
complaint
as
to
the
respondents,
lehman
brothers,
and
affirming
the
judgment
as
against
the
respondents
thomas.
the
action
was
originally
commenced
by
the
petitioner,
a
stockholder
of
tide
water
associated
oil
company,
on
its
behalf,
to
recover
short-swing
profits
realized
by
lehman
brothers
from
its
transactions
in
the
stock
of
tide
water.
this
action
was
brought
pursuant
to
section
16
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
which,
in
substance,
provides
that,
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
unfair
use
of
information
which
may
have
been
obtained
by
a
director,
an
officer,
or
a
10%
stockholder,
any
profit
realized
by
such
person
shall
be
recoverable
by
the
issuer
or
if
the
issuer
fails
to
sue
by
a
stockholder
who
brings
such
action
on
its
behalf.
pursuant
to
the
man
upon
tide
water
and
its
failure
to
commence
such
suit,
the
petitioner
as
a
stockholder
did
commence
such
suit.
now,
the
issue
involved
here
is
the
interpretation
to
be
given
to
section
16
(b),
whether
or
not
the
congressional
purpose
expressly
stated
by
congress
should
be
carried
out
or
whether
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
should
be
followed.
another
issue
involved
here
is
whether
or
not
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
the
power
to
formulate
and
make
rules
which
congress
specifically
allowed
it
to
make
and
what
effect
the
court
should
give
to
such
rules
in
interpreting
the
purpose
of
section
16
(b).
now,
before
going
into
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
think
it
would
be
advisable
to
go
into
the
history
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
your
honors
will
recall
that,
in
1929,
there
was
a
stock
market
crash
and
which
vividly
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
the
fact
that
there
was
looseness
in
national
stock
exchanges,
there
were
manipulations
by
insiders,
and
there
were
gen
--
the
general
makeup
of
the
market
and
the
sale
and
purchase
of
securities
were
such
as
to
put
the
investors
generally
in
a
very
bad
position
as
compared
to
the
persons
who
are
in
the
inside
of
the
corporation.
extended
hearings
were
held
before
the
congressional
committees
and,
pursuant
to
such
hearings,
congress
decided
to
enact
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
and
its
general
purpose
was
to
protect
the
investors
to
prohibit
market
manipulation
and
to
maintain
fair
and
free
markets
so
that
investors
throughout
the
country
might
go
into
the
market
and
purchase
or
sell
securities
knowing
that
there
are
no
inside
manipulations
which
cause
the
prices
to
go
up
or
down.
now,
closely
alike
to
this
general
purpose
for
the
enactment
of
section
6
--
the
enactment
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
was
the
furnishing
of
reports
by
insiders.
congress
found
that
insiders
had
used
their
confidential
knowledge
of
the
corporation
to
manipulate
stock,
to
purchase
stock,
to
sell
stock
based
upon
such
knowledge
and
that
the
investors
were
at
a
great
disadvantage
because
of
that.
so,
congress
decided
to
require
these
insiders
such
as
officers,
directors,
and
principal
stockholders
who
could
have
use
of
such
inside
information
and
who
are
in
such
a
position
to
get
it
to
furnish
reports
of
their
purchases
or
sales
of
stock.
and,
in
order
to
deter
them
from
making
use
of
confidential
information,
they
inaugurated
a
plan
whereby
if
the
director
or
officer
or
principal
stockholder
purchased
and
sold
a
security
of
an
issuer
which
was
listed
upon
the
national
security
exchange,
if
such
transaction
occurred
within
a
period
of
less
than
six
months,
this
--
the
profit
realized
by
such
insider
was
recoverable
from
him
regardless
of
his
intention
--
as
stated
in
the
section,
regardless
of
his
intention
of
rep
--
of
not
repurchasing
the
securities
sold
or
of
not
selling
the
securities
purchased
within
a
period
of
six
months.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
yes,
sir?
mr.
morris
j.
levy
the
statute,
as
finally
enacted,
did
state
that
it
applied
only
to
directors.
it
didn't
state
the
word
“only.”
it
actually
stated,
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
use
of
unfair
information,
any
purchase
or
sale
by
a
director,
an
officer,
or
10%
stockholder.
it
should
be
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that's
right,
but
i
went
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
prevent
the
use
of
inside
information
which
might
be
obtained
by
an
officer,
director,
or
principal
stockholder.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
not
as
defined.
principal
stockholder
was
later
defined.
in
other
words,
they
used
a
rule
of
thumb.
originally,
they
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
wished
to
make
a
person
liable
who
owned
only
5%
of
the
stock.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
discussions
as
to
whether
or
not
a
person,
a
director,
an
officer
who
disclosed
confidential
information
to
a
third
party,
whether
or
not
he
should
be
held
liable.
and
of
course,
in
view
of
the
administrative
difficulties
in
proving
that
such
disclosure
was
made,
congress
dropped
that
end
of
it
and
merely
decided
to
incorporate
the
words
“director,
officer,
or
10%
stockholder.”
mr.
morris
j.
levy
no,
of
administrative
difficulties.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that
appears
in
--
on
page
18
of
my
brief.
in
the
course
of
congressional
hearings,
one
of
the
draftsmen
of
the
act
testified
that
section
16
(b)
is
designed
to
reach
an
insider
short-swing
profits
irrespective
of
any
intention
or
expectation
to
sell
the
security
within
six
months
since
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
prove
the
existence
of
such
intention
or
expectation.
and,
you
have
to
have
this
crude
rule
of
thumb
because
you
cannot
undertake
the
burden
of
having
to
prove
that
the
director
intended,
at
the
time
he
bought,
to
get
out
on
a
short-swing.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that's
right,
sir.
now,
i
refer
your
honors
to
section
2
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
whereby
congress
specifically
stated
its
purpose
for
enacting
the
statute
in
general
in
these
words,
and
it
said,
“transactions
in
securities
as
commonly
conducted
upon
securities
exchanges
and
over-the-counter
markets
are
affected
with
a
national
public
interest
which
makes
it
necessary
to
provide
for
regulation
and
control
of
such
transactions
and
of
practices
and
matters
related
thereto,
including
transactions
by
officers,
directors,
and
principal
security
holders,
to
require
appropriate
reports,
and
to
impose
requirements
necessary
to
make
such
regulation
and
control
reasonably
complete
and
effective,
and
insure
the
maintenance
of
fair
and
honest
markets
in
such
transactions.”
and,
of
course,
they
go
on
for
about
a
page
and
a
half
setting
forth
why
--
the
reasons
why
the
--
that
such
transactions
are
affected
with
a
national
public
interest.
now,
in
construing
section
16
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934,
the
courts
have
recognized
that
this
type
of
statute
is
a
remedial
statute
and
that,
in
order
to
give
it
the
meaning
which
congress
intended,
there
must
be
a
broad
application
of
its
terms.
and,
the
courts
have
gone
out
of
their
way
to
make
certain
that
there
would
not
be
any
loophole
wherein
an
insider
could
transcend
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
realize
for
himself
a
short-swing
profit
denied
to
other
investors.
under
section
16
(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act,
provision
is
made
that
an
insider
must
file
certain
reports
with
respect
to
his
transactions
showing
the
change
of
ownership.
section
16
(b),
as
i've
stated
before,
provides
for
the
recovery
of
short-swing
profits
realized
by
such
insider.
now,
it's
remarkable
to
note
at
this
point
that
there
were
certain
exemptions
from
the
operation
of
the
statute
which
congress
specifically
incorporated
in
the
act.
for
instance,
in
section
16
(b),
there
is
exempt
from
its
operation
any
acquisition
of
stock
received
in
payment
of
a
debt
contracted
in
good
faith.
otherwise,
the
person
who
has
contracted
a
debt,
who
--
to
whom
money
is
owed,
obtain
stock
for
the
payment
of
his
debt
and,
if
that
was
done
in
good
faith,
the
acquisition
of
the
stock
is
not
considered
a
purchase.
now,
section
16
(b)
further
provides
that
foreign
and
domestic
arbitrage
transactions
are
exempted
unless,
and
the
statute
specifically
says,
“unless
it
is
made
contrary
to
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
commission
may
make
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
purposes
of
this
statute.”
thus,
by
granting
this
automatic
exemption,
under
this
provision
of
the
act,
and
permitting
the
commission
to
make
rules
avoiding
such
exemption,
it
would
appear
that
the
commission
has
the
implied
authority
to
make
such
rules
as
it
deems
proper
to
carry
out
the
purposes
in
other
cases.
and,
this
is
what
the
commission
actually
did.
now,
about
15
years
ago,
the
commission
decided
to
promulgate
a
rule
whereby
a
director
who
was
a
partner
of
a
firm
who
had
traded
in
securities
was
required
to
report
his
proportionate
share
of
the
purchases
or
sales
effected
by
his
firm.
subsequently,
this
rule
was
changed,
and
this
rule
was
changed
by
the
commission
after
a
case
was
decided
by
the
second
circuit,
rattner
against
lehman,
which
is
in
direct
contravention
to
the
purposes
for
which
the
statute,
section
16
(b)
was
enacted.
i
think
i
can
get
now
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i
think
you
have
a
history
of
the
statute
in
general.
i
think
the
facts
now
will
show
that
in
its
application,
the
court
did
not
apply
the
proper
interpretation.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that's
right,
sir.
that
was
--
that
was
before
this
case.
when
this
case
was
in
existence,
he
was
required
to
report
all
the
transactions
of
his
partnership.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that's
right.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that's
right.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that's
right,
sir.
now
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
no,
it
was
not.
it
still
is
--
it
still
is
in
existence.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows,
lehman
brothers
is
a
new
york
partnership
composed
of
approximately
17
partners.
prior
to
august
of
1954,
mr.
john
hertz,
who
was
a
partner
of
lehman
brothers,
was
a
director
of
tide
water
associated
oil
company.
his
testimony
is
that
he
joined
lehman
brothers
in
1934
to
bring
business
to
lehman
brothers
and
that
he
joined
tide
water
as
a
director
to
bring
business
--
its
business
to
lehman
brothers.
and
he
further
testified
that
his
joint
--
his
being
a
director
certainly
did
bring
lehman
brothers
business.
he
further
testified
that,
during
the
course
of
his
being
a
director,
he
gossiped
about
the
affairs
of
tide
water
to
his
partners,
discussed
the
matters
with
them,
and
that,
of
course,
in
the
course
of
financing
which
lehman
brothers
did
for
tide
water,
he,
as
a
director,
was
the
person
in
charge
of
that
and
he
discussed
the
matters
with
his
partners
since
he
had
more
knowledge
of
its
affairs.
some
time
prior
to
august
of
1954,
mr.
hertz
decided
to
resign
his
directorship
from
tide
water
and
he
came
over
to
his
partner
--
his
fellow-partner,
mr.
thomas
and
said,
“mr.
thomas,
how
would
you
like
to
become
a
director
of
tide
water?”
mr.
thomas
said
he
would.
so,
mr.
hertz
called
up
the
president
of
tide
water
and
said
“mr.
staples,
i
have
a
smart
young
man
here
who
is
my
partner.
i'd
like
to
have
him
become
a
director
in
my
place.”
and,
within
a
short
time,
of
course,
mr.
thomas
was
appointed
a
director
of
tide
water
and
his
appointment
was
effective
as
of
the
date
when
mr.
hertz's
resignation
took
effect.
on
the
same
date,
one
went
in
--
went
out
and
the
other
went
in.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
he
was
the
one
--
he
was
appointed
at
that
time
because
the
--
it
was
an
interim
term.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
now,
mr.
hertz
testified
that,
before
his
resignation
had
become
effective
from
the
tide
water
board,
there
was
some
discussion
amongst
the
members
of
the
tide
water
board
concerning
the
issuance
by
tide
water
of
a
preferred
stock
which
could
be
converted
--
which
could
be
into
which
the
common
could
be
converted,
the
common
which
was
outstanding.
there
was
also
some
discussion
with
respect
to
the
refinancing
of
a
new
refinery
for
tide
water.
and
that
mr.
hertz
admitted
that
he
discussed
these
matters
with
his
partners
in
lehman
brothers.
now,
after
mr.
hertz
have
resigned
from
lehman
--
from
tide
water,
mr.
thomas
admitted
that,
on
several
occasions,
he
was
asked
by
his
partners
at
lehman
brothers
what
he
thought
of
the
business,
the
prospects
of
tide
water,
and
that
he
had
answered
them
and
told
them
that
the
prospects
were
very
good
and
that
it
should
be
a
good
investment.
and
his
testimony
indicated
that
he
had
spoken
in
this
fashion
to
at
least
six
of
his
partners
at
lehman
brothers,
including
one,
a
mr.
hammerslough
who
actually
gave
the
orders
to
lehman
brothers
to
purchase
--
to
commence
purchasing
tide
water
stock
involved
in
this
case.
now,
without
a
short
time
after
such
discussion
with
mr.
thomas,
mr.
hammerslough
told
his
office
to
start
purchasing
common
stock
of
tide
water
and,
when
mr.
thomas
saw
the
common
stock
being
purchased
and
asked
what
that
was
for,
he
was
informed
that,
“well,
we're
purchasing
the
stock
because
we
expect
to
convert
it
into
the
new
preferred
which
is
going
to
be
issued
by
tide
water
and
that
we're
going
to
sell
it
to
institutional
investors
because
it's
a
good
investment.
now,
mr.
--
these
--
50,000
shares
of
this
common
stock
of
tide
water
was
so-purchased
within
a
period
of
approximately
one
month.
subsequently,
the
directors
and
the
stockholders
of
tide
water
did
approve
a
resolution
granting
the
right
to
issue
the
preferred
stock
and
permitting
the
conversion
of
the
common
to
the
preferred
stock.
now,
after
the
resolution
was
passed,
lehman
brothers
converted
its
preferred
--
it's
prominence
preferred
and
immediately,
within
less
than
six
months,
a
matter
of
fact,
within
approximately
two
months,
sold
the
preferred
stock
to
investor,
realizing,
as
the
trial
court
found
a
short-swing
profit
of
approximately
$98,000.
the
court
--
the
trial
court
held
that
since
the
statute,
section
16
(b),
does
not
state
that
a
partner
must
--
or,
rather,
a
partnership
must
return
profit,
the
trial
court
decided
to
go
by
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute
said,
“a
director,
an
officer,
or
a
10%
stockholder”
and
the
trial
court
said,
“well,
lehman
brothers
is
not
a
director,
it
is
not
an
officer,
and
it
is
not
a
10%
stockholder,
therefore,
no
liability,
as
far
as
they're
concerned.
with
respect
to
thomas,
who
is
a
director,
well,
he
has
a
certain
percentage
of
interest
in
the
partnership.
we'll
only
award
judgment
against
him
for
his
proportionate
share
of
his
partnership
interest.
now,
on
the
course
of
examination,
on
the
course
of
the
trial,
it
came
out
from
the
mouth
of
mr.
thomas
that
he
had
waived
his
right.
after
the
first
purchases
of
common
stock
had
been
made,
he
had
orally
told
his
partners
at
a
luncheon,
“i
don't
want
to
have
any
part
of
this
transaction.
i
don't
want
any
profit.
i
don't
want
any
loss.”
further,
it
was
shown
that
--
on
other
occasions,
other
partners
of
lehman
brothers
have
similarly
waived
their
rights
to
transactions
or
to
profits
from
short-swing
transactions
in
corporations
of
which
they
were
directors.
and,
the
testimony
showed
that
during
every
time
which
these
profits
were
waived,
the
other
partners
of
course
received
more
than
their
proportionate
share
in
order
to
make
up
the
difference,
so
that
at
no
time
did
any
of
the
partners
actually
suffer
any
financial
loss
by
reason
of
their
having
waived
their
rights
to
such
profits.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
no,
what
i
said
was,
your
honor,
that
every
time
that
one
partner
waived
his
right
to
receive
his
share
of
the
profits,
his
share
of
the
profits
was
distributed
amongst
the
other
partners.
so,
instead
of
one
partner
getting,
say,
8%,
he'd
get
8.2%.
and
in
this
way,
it
was
a
round-robin
where
one
partner
would
give
up
his
profits
and
would
not
actually
be
paid
that.
he
would
make
it
up
from
another
transaction
where
another
partner
similarly
waived
his
rights
thereto.
now
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that's
right.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
but,
i
say
to
your
honor
that
even
if
there
were
no
other
transactions,
assuming
that
there
was
no
testimony
that
there
had
been
any
other
waivers
by
other
partners
of
profits
made
by
the
firm
and
corporations
in
which
they
were
directors,
that
that
still
would
not
excuse
the
return
or
the
recovery
from
lehman
brothers
in
this
particular
tide
water
transaction
because
you
cannot
disassociate
a
partner
from
his
partnership.
you
cannot
disassociate
what
information
a
partner
gives
to
his
partnership.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
the
partnership
law,
a
partnership
must
divulge
any
information
concerning
the
partnership
business
to
his
partners.
and,
thomas,
naturally,
would
be
under
a
duty
to
divulge
such
information
to
his
other
partners.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
well,
under
the--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
under
the
new
york
partnership
act,
your
honor,
each
partner
must
divulge
information
involving
the
partnership
business.
it
cannot
withhold
such
information
with
the
other
partners.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
apparently,
it
couldn't
happen
in
new
york
or
it
shouldn't
happen
in
new
york.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
well,
apparently,
your
honor,
at
this
moment,
all
i
can
find
is
section
23
of
the
partnership
act
which
provides
partnership
charged
with
knowledge
or
notice
to
partner
and
it
can
be
imputed
and
implied
that
if
a
partner
knows
something,
then
the
other
partners
must
know
that,
too.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
as
long
as
you--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
no,
i
don't
say
that.
i
say
if
it
reflects
upon
the
business
of
the
partnership,
if
it
involves
the
business
of
the
partnership.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
well,
the
question
is,
how
can
--
it's
actually
between
two
firms.
whether
he
has
to
disclose
information
to
his
partnership
of
anything
that
involves
partnership
business
and,
if
he's
under
a
duty
not
to
disclose,
because
he's
a
director,
confidential
information,
then
the
question
is
what
should
he
do?
but
i
don't
think
we're
confronted
with
this
problem
at
the
present
time.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
well,
here's--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
well,
section
42
of
the
partnership
act
provides
duty
of
partners
to
render
information.
partners
shall
render
on
demand
true
and
full
information
of
all
things
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
on
all
--
of
all
things
affecting
the
partnership
to
any
partner
or
the
legal
representative
of
any
deceased
partner
or
partner
under
legal
disability.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
now,
getting
back
to
the
case
of
--
at
hand,
your
honors,
judge
medina,
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
for
the
court
below,
recognized
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
would
provide
--
would
desire
that
the
partnership
be
held
responsible
for
all
the
short-swing
profits
realized
by
it
because
the
director
is
--
the
director
of
the
corporation
is
also
a
member
of
the
partnership
and
he
stated
there
is
only
one
way
to
prevent
stock
manipulations
by
insiders
to
whom
confidential
information
is
available
and
that
is
to
squeeze
every
possible
penny
of
profit
out
of
such
transactions.
this
has
been
held
to
be
the
clear
purpose
of
section
16
(b),
a
broadly
remedial
statute.
one
way
to
do
this
was
to
construe
section
16
(b)
to
include
the
partnership
because
of
the
unity
of
the
partnership
relationship
and
the
fact
that
one
of
the
partners
is
a
director.
he
decided
not
to
follow
this
because
of
a
case
previously
decided
by
the
same
court
in
rattner
against
lehman.
now
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
came
to
court,
asked
for
judgment
against
the
partnership
upon
the
bare
legal
assertion.
here,
you
have
a
partnership
that
realized
profits
from
its
short-swing
transactions.
the
director
--
a
partner
is
a
director
of
the
firm.
therefore,
the
partnership
is
responsible.
there
was
no
proof
of
any
information
being
given
to
any
of
the
partners
concerning
the
prospects
that
--
the
business
affairs
of
the
corporation.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
there's
an
--
the
undisputable
proof
that
mr.
thomas
and
mr.
hertz
discussed
the
matters
of
tide
water
with
their
partners,
that
the
lehman
brothers
advised
tide
water
with
respect
to
its
financial
operations,
and
of
necessity,
had
to
have
knowledge
of
its
business
affairs
was
in
it
of
itself
in
a
fiduciary
relationship
to
tide
water
because
of
that.
similarly,
as
if
an
attorney
who
represented
a
corporation
had
to
be
informed
about
serving
information
would
be
a
fiduciary.
from
an
addition
to
being
such
fiduciary,
there
was
--
the
partner
who
was
the
director
on
the
board
and
the
statute
says
that
any
short-swing
profits
realized
by
such
person
must
be
recoverable
or
may
be
recoverable
from
him.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
had
the
entity
theory?
mr.
morris
j.
levy
offhand,
your
honor--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
offhand,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
know.
i
couldn't
give
you
an
answer.
i
wonder,
your
honor,
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
on
this.
i
think
you
have
enough
of
my
argument.
i'd
like
some
--
the
additional
time
for
my
rebuttal.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question,
as
i
see
it
here
--
the
issue,
as
i
see
it
here,
is
the
interpretation
which
this
court
must
give
to
a
statutory
purpose
and
inherent
in
the
act.
congress
specifically
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
prevent
the
use
of
inside
information
in
specifying
the
three
categories
of
persons
who
are
in
such
relationship
to
an
issuer.
that
they
would,
in
the
course
or
the
nature
of
their
duties,
have
access
to
inside
information.
congress,
by
no
means,
meant
merely
to
stupefy
or
merely
to
limit
the
liability
under
that
section
to
those
three
types
of
persons
mentioned.
it
would
seem
from
the
purpose
--
from
the
statutory
purpose
that
any
person
who
has
access,
who
was
so
close
to
the
issuer,
that
he
would
have
access
to
inside
information
would
be
one
of
those
persons
against
whom
the
statute
would
apply.
now,
i
believe
that
a
partnership,
a
member
of
which
is
on
the
board
of
an
issuer,
who
deals
in
securities
of
the
issuer
and
who
is,
in
the
nature
--
in
the
very
nature
of
its
business,
an
investment
adviser
to
the
issuer
is
in
such
close
relationship
to
the
issuer
that
it
must
be
deemed
as
a
person
who
has
access
to
confidential
information
and
against
whom
the
statute
was
meant
to
apply.
this
court
has
on
several
occasions
held
that
it
would
not
--
it
will
not
be
limited
by
the
literal
statutory
words
of
a
statute
but
will
apply
the
statute
even
beyond
its
literal
wording
in
order
to
accomplish
the
purpose
which
congress
intended.
i
specifically
refer
your
honors
to
the
cases
of
the
united
states
against
american
trucking
association
where
this
court
held
that
there
is,
of
course,
no
more
persuasive
evidence
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute
than
the
words
by
which
the
legislature
undertook
to
give
expression
to
its
wishes.
often,
these
words
are
sufficient
in
and
of
themselves
to
determine
the
purpose
of
the
legislation.
in
such
cases,
we
have
followed
their
plain
meaning
when
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
--
that
meaning
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
has
led
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
sorry.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
--
when
that
meaning
has
led
to
absurd
or
futile
results.
however,
this
court
has
looked
beyond
the
words
to
the
purpose
of
the
act.
frequently,
however,
even
when
the
plain
meaning
did
not
produce
absurd
results,
but
merely
an
unreasonable
one.
plainly
at
variance
with
a
policy
of
the
legislation
as
a
whole,
this
court
has
followed
that
purpose,
rather
than
the
literal
words.
i
say
to
your
honor
that
the
accomplishments
of
the
statutory
purpose
can
only
be
effectuated
by
holding
in
this
case
a
partnership
liable
for
its
short-swing
transactions
because
of
the
fact
that
one
of
its
members
is
a
director
of
the
issuer,
has
--
definitely
has
access
to
inside
information
and,
apart
from
which,
the
partnership
itself
because
of
the
nature
of
its
business
with
the
issuer
also
has
the
same
access
to
inside
information.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
i'd
say,
your
honor,
that
it
would
apply
to
a
limited
partner.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
well,
i'm
assuming,
your
honor,
that
the
same
facts
--
you're
also
giving
me
the
same
facts
with
respect
to
the
partnership.
now,
the
partnership
is
also
an
investment
adviser
to
the
issuer.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
i
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
i'd
say
that
the
close
relationship
of
a
limited
partner
to
the
rest
of
his
partners
would
seem
that
--
to
make
him
liable
or
to
make
his
partnership
firm
liable
for
any
profits
realized
by
the
firm.
but
i
say,
in
this
case,
we
don't
have
to
come
to
that.
i
say,
your
honors,
that
the
court
below
--
the
trial
court
below
found
as
a
fact
that
there
was
no
deputation
of
mr.
thomas
by
lehman
brothers.
i
can't
see
how
as
a
legal
conclusion,
the
court
could
have
made
such
finding.
here
we
have
a
person
who
is
a
member
of
a
partnership,
mr.
hertz,
who
testified
that
he
joined
the
firm
of
lehman
brothers
to
bring
his
business,
that
he
joined
tide
water
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
business
to
lehman
brothers
--
the
tide
water
business
to
lehman
brothers,
that
he
recommended
mr.
thomas
--
that
he
asked
mr.
thomas
whether
he
wished
to
be
a
member
of
the
tide
water
board
and
that
his
purpose
of
asking
him
whether
he
wanted
to
be
a
member
was
to
--
for
him
to
further
the
interest
of
lehman
brothers,
that
pursuant
to
his
recommendation
which
was
tantamount
to
i
suppose
an
order
since
mr.
hertz
had
been
a
director
of
tide
water
for
approximately
20
years
and
he
was
sort
of
the
elder
statesman
there,
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
lehman
brothers
was
the
financial
adviser
to
tide
water,
how
there
could
be
a
legal
finding
that
lehman
brothers
did
not
deputize
mr.
thomas
to
be
--
to
represent
its
interest
on
the
board.
it's
most
difficult
to
see
judge
clark
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
the
only
interest
it
had
at
that
time
was
that
they
were
getting
the
business
from
tide
water
in
the
financing.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
afterwards,
yes,
sir.
and
then,
it's
also
interesting
to
note,
your
honor,
that
in
a
testimony
of
mr.
thomas,
he
testified
that
at
the
time
prior
to
his
joining
the
tide
water
board,
he
owned
approximately
4,000
shares
of
stock
in
monterey
oil
which
he
claimed
was
a
competing
company.
and
that
in
order
for
him
to
take
his
job
with
tide
water,
he
promised
to
give
up
his
directorship
in
monterey,
although
he
stated
he
didn't
own
one
share
of
stock
in
tide
water
which
apparently
assumes
that
here's
a
person
giving
up
a
directorship
in
a
company
which
he
has
a
large
investment
to
take
a
directorship
in
a
company
in
which
he
has
no
investment
whatsoever.
that
was
only
done
for
the
purpose
of
representing
lehman
brothers.
in
fact,
lehman
--
he
was
deputized
by
lehman
brothers
to
do
that.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
i
certainly
do,
your
honor.
i
say,
the
legal
conclusion,
the
finding
was
wrong,
and
judge
clark
apparently
sides
with
me
and
says
that
the
lily
was
gilded.
he
couldn't
see
how
--
how
the
court
could
find
that
there
was
no
deputation
there.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
my
basic
position
is
--
well,
actually,
my
basic
position
is
--
it's
two
things.
it
is
that
the
partnership
in
general,
as
a
legal
proposition,
should
be
held
liable
apart
from
any
deputation
but
that
there
was
deputation
there.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
yes.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
well,
i
differ
from
the
commission,
your
honor,
and
that
i
do
not
accept
the
findings,
respectfully
so,
of
the
courts
below
that
there
was
no
deputation.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
no,
that's
a
conclusion
by
judge
clark
from
the
evidence.
he
found
that
--
he
felt
that
the
--
there
was
deputation
that
there
couldn't
be
anything
but
--
anything
else
but
deputation
from
the
facts
and
he
couldn't
understand
how
a
court
could
find
otherwise.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
yes,
sir.
i
maintain
with
the
commission
that
the
partnerships
must
be
held
liable
(voice
overlap)
under
the
interpretation.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
now,
if
we
go
to
the
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
morris
j.
levy
because
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that's
my
point.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that's
right.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that's
exactly
what
i
meant
to
say
and
i
hope
i
have
made
my
argument
clear
with
respect
to
that.
i
say
it's
not
restricted
to
only
those
three
mentioned
that
congress
never
intended
to
restrict
that
merely
by
mentioning
it.
they
didn't
say
that
it
shall
only
apply
to
a
director
or
officer,
but
they
said
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
unfair
use
of
information.
any
profits
realized
by
a
director,
because
a
director,
officer,
or
10%-stockholder,
by
reason
of
his
relationship
to
the
issuer,
because
he
had
access
to
information,
should
be
recoverable.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
no,
i
say
the
remedy,
your
honor,
if
this
statute
is
not,
as
mr.
seymour
stated,
a
penal
statute,
it
is
a
remedial
statute.
all
the
courts
have
so
held
the
statute
from
the
history
to
be
a
remedial
statute,
and
that
the
courts
must
apply
its
operation
to
the
facts
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
carry
out
the
very
purpose
which
congress
intended
to
be
carried
out
and,
on
--
that,
unless
that
is
done,
the
statute
will
actually
fall
by
the
wayside
and
have
no
usefulness
whatsoever.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
yes,
sir.
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
the
statute
creates
a
right
against
a
person
whose
relationship
to
the
issuer
is
such
that
he
may
have
access
to
inside
information.
the
very
essence
of
the
statute
is
access
to
inside
information
so
that
he
isn't
able
to
use
such
information.
that
is
the
very
evil
against
which
the
statute
is
aimed.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
no,
realized
by
him,
specifying
those
three
types
of
persons
who
fall
within
the
category
of
persons
who
have
access
to
inside
information,
but
not
excluding
--
not
excluding
anybody
who
can
be
proved
to
be
in
such
relationship
to
the
issuer
that
he
has
indeed
such
access
to
inside
information.
i
believe
that,
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
actually
proven
that
there
was
inside
information
transmitted
to
the
partnership
by
the
partners.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
well,
i
say
we
have
two
--
two
ways
to
hold
the
partnership
and
that
is,
one,
to
actually
carry
out
the
congressional
purpose
and
we
say
that
congress
stated
that
anybody
who
has
access
to
inside
information
is
in
such
relationship
to
the
issuer
that
he
has
access
to
such
information
shall
be
held
liable,
or
we
can
go
on
the
proposition
that
there
was
deputation.
now,
if
your
honors
find
that
the
conclusions
of
the
court
below,
there
was
--
that
there
was
no
deputation,
of
course,
i'd
want
to
proceed
on
the
theory
that
the
purpose
of
congress
must
be
carried
out
and
that
the
only
it
can
be
carried
out
is
by
holding
the
partnership
liable
for
the
profits
because
a
director,
a
member
of
its
firm,
is
a
partner
--
is
a
director.
now,
going
to
the
partner
himself,
to
thomas
himself,
we
need
not
go
beyond
the
reaches
of
the
statute
in
his
case.
he
was
a
director.
there
was
no
doubt.
there's
no
doubt
of
that.
the
statute
reaches
him.
now,
why
should
his
profits
be
limited
to
a
proportionate
partnership
interest?
in
order
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
this
court
would
not
have
to
go
beyond
the
literal
meaning
of
the
words
but,
actually,
by
holding
him
liable
for
the
entire
profits,
the
congressional
purpose
would
be
carried
out
in
this
fashion.
of
course,
if
he
and
his
partnership
were
held
liable
jointly
and
severally,
i
think
that
would
be
--
that
should
be
--
that
should
be
the
congressional
--
it
should
be
the
attitude
of
the
court
in
carrying
out
the
purpose
of
congress,
but
if
the
court
sees
fit
not
to
hold
the
partnership,
i
say
only
by
holding
the
partner
himself
for
the
entire
profits
can
the
congressional
purpose
be
carried
out
in
this
case
and,
by
doing
so,
this
court
would
not
have
to
go
beyond
the
very
reaches
or
literal
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
well,
as
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
as
an
owner,
as
a
co-owner
of
the
partnership
funds,
the
partnership
realized
--
realized
the
profits.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
well,
realized
by
him.
“by
his
partnership”
is
him,
too.
i
say
that
his
partnership
is
him.
he
and
his
partnership
are
one
and
the
same.
he
cannot
be
disassociated
from
his
partnership.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
i
believe,
your
honor,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
that
each
partner
has
an
indivisible
interest
in
common
with
the
other
partners,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
that
is
the
law.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
now,
mr.
seymour
has
made
some
statement
here
with
respect
to
certain
of
the
facts
with
respect
to
waiver
not
being
properly
set
forth.
now,
i
refer
your
honors
to
pages
126
and
127
of
the
record
in
which
mr.
thomas
specifically
testified
that
there
had
been
cases
where
his
partners
have
waived
--
125
and
126
of
the
record.
we
have
had
a
number
of
transactions,
and
i'm
quoting,
“in
which
other
partners
have
waived
their
interests
of
short-swing
profits.”
there
were
the
facts
which
indicate
that
there
had
been
other
cases.
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
in
favor
of
the
other
partners
in
other
--
other
corporations.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
page
125
to
126
of
the
record.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
morris
j.
levy
yes.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
no,
125
(a)
and
125
--
126
(a).
that
was
an
--
that
was
not
an
offer
of
proof.
it
was
actually
testimony
by
mr.
thomas
in
which
he
was
asked
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
well,
no,
i
refer
your
honor
prior
to
that.
my
question
was
--
i
started
with
“now,”
and
he
answered
“i
might
tell
you,
mr.
levy,
that
we
have
had
a
number
of
transactions
in
which
other
partners
waived
their
interest,
primarily
cab
financing
whereby
a
lawyer
can't
participate.”
now,
question,
“were
a
partner
in
lehman
brothers
waives
his
interest
in
a
transaction,
is
that
partner's
interest
distributed
amongst
the
other
partners?”
answer,
“it
is
to
my
understanding,
yes.”
then,
of
course
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that
is
--
mr.
morris
j.
levy
that
is
true,
your
honor,
except
that
he
specifically
stated
cab
financing
primarily,
not
excluding
other
transactions,
he
did
not
exclude
other
transactions
and
said
--
and
say
they're
limiting
it
to
cash
transactions.
mr.
morris
j.
levy
i
don't
believe
i
did
pursue
that,
your
honor.
