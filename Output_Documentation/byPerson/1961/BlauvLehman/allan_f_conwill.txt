mr.
allan
f.
conwill
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would,
first
of
all,
like
to
clarify
a
view
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
concerning
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
to
counsel
for
the
petitioner
on
the
duty
of
a
partner
to
disclose
information
concerning
the
corporation
of
which
he
is
a
director
to
his
partnership.
i
think
section
42
of
the
new
york
partnership
law
may
very
well
be
read
to
indicate
a
duty
on
the
part
of
a
partner
to
disclose
his
partnership
or
disclose
to
his
partnership
confidential
information.
but
we,
at
the
commission,
very
strongly
feel
that
section
16
(b)
of
the
exchange
act
provides
a
paramount
duty
and
that
paramount
duty
in
the
federal
act
overrides
any
duty
that
he
might
have
to
disclose
under
section
42
of
the
new
york
state
partnership
act.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
it
has
nothing
to
say
and
disclosure
or
nondisclosure
is
irrelevant,
sir.
now
to
us,
at
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
there
are
only
four
basic
facts
with
which
this
court
need
to
concern
itself
in
order
to
render
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
position
we
urge.
in
this
connection,
perhaps
we
take
a
slightly
different
view
than
counsel
for
the
petitioner
but
to
us,
the
only
four
vital
facts
are,
first
of
all,
that
joseph
thomas
was
a
partner
in
lehman
brothers.
second,
that
he
was
a
director
of
tide
water.
third,
that
lehman
brothers
bought
and
sold
tide
water
equity
securities
within
a
period
of
six
months.
and
fourth,
that
lehman
brothers
realized
a
profit.
all
of
these
facts
are
admitted
and
it
is
our
contention
that
these
four
basic
facts
must
establish
liability
under
section
16
(b).
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
liability,
we
contend,
on
the
part
of
lehman
brothers,
the
partnership
for
the
full
amount
of
profits
which
were
realized.
liability
also
on
the
part
of
joseph
thomas
for
the
full
amount
of
profits
realized.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i
don't
think
it's
relevant
at
all
that
he
gave
his
brother
inside
information.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
it
does.
that
would
pose
a
difficult
question
for
us
at
the
commission
because
we
feel
that
section
16
(b)
should
be
interpreted
in
light
of
whether
or
not
the
relationship
or
the
transaction
gives
rise
to
the
danger
or
the
potentiality
of
the
use
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
--
of
inside
information.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i'm
sure
that's
correct.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
possibly,
sir,
although
i
would
say
that
the
relationship
of
partners
is
of
a
type
of
intimacy
that
sometimes
you
do
not
always
find
in
brothers.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
again--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
in
the
situation
of
the
wife,
the
partner
certainly
has,
i
would
say,
in
the
normal
case
of
beneficial
interest,
and
what
the
wife
does,
any
profit
she
realizes
in
the
ordinary
marriage,
i
would
say,
would
go
down
to
his
benefit.
and,
again,
the
danger
of
the
transmission
and
the
use
of
inside
information
is
there.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
it
is
in
this
case
because,
here,
of
course
we
are
considering
the
partnership.
i
might
say
that
we
can
do
apply
a
test
in
16
(b)
cases
similar
to
a
test
applied
by
a
distinguished
jury
as
happened
in
the
sixth
circuit
in
fredo
against
newman,
that
is,
you
look
at
the
transaction
and
the
relationship
and
determine
from
that
whether
or
not
there
is
a
danger
of
the
use
of
inside
information.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
it's
quite
a
different
issue,
i
agree,
but
the
basic
reasoning
to
us
is
relevant.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i
agree--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i
agree
that,
to
use
that
test
and
that
test
alone
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
--
would
not
be
sufficient.
we
need
something
more.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we
do
have
something
more.
we
have
the
relationship
of
the
director
and
the
partner.
the
partner
was
a
director.
the
partnership
act
was
his
act
under
conventional
and
under
new
york
partnership
law.
so,
we
tie
it
in
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
yes,
sir.
what
i
was
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
yes,
sir.
under
section
3
(a)
(9)
of
the
exchange
act,
“person”
includes
“a
partnership.”
therefore,
we
would
say
that
when
section
16
(a)
starts
off,
“every
person
who
is
a
beneficial
owner,
director,
or
officer,
that
the
person
--”
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
yes,
sir.
that
“person”
since
it
includes
partnership,
can
properly
include
the
partnership
as
a
director
in
this
situation
and,
indeed,
where
the
danger
is
so
clearly
present
or
the
potential
use
--
the
potential
unfair
advantage
to
be
gained
by
unfair
use
of
information
is
there,
we
believe
that
section
16
(b)
must
be
so
construed.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
it
is
not
in
section
16
(b).
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
the
definition
helps
us
in
this
way,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
section
16
(b),
in
referring
to
beneficial
owner,
director,
and
officer,
refers
back
to
the
reporting
requirements
of
these
categories
in
section
16
(a).
section
16
(a)
leads
up,
“every
person
who
is
a
director.”
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
we
take
that
position
that
for
purposes
of
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
we
take
that
position,
sir,
in
this
case.
we
feel
that--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
yes,
sir.
it
is
vital
to
the
case.
we
feel
that,
in
order
to
effectuate
the
statutory
purpose
of
section
16
(b),
that
it
is
necessary
to
consider
lehman
brothers
as
equivalent
to
a
partner
of
tide
water
associated
oil
company.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
that
is
correct.
we're
not
saying
really
“equal
to,”
we're
saying
that,
for
purposes
of
section
16
(b),
we're
urging
the
court
to
consider
lehman
brothers
as
a
director.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
well,
that
is
the
legal
rationale
by
which
we
arrive
at
the
result
which
we
urge,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
are
you
referring
now
to
the
partner
who
is
a
director?
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
yes,
it
would
be
the
partner's
transaction.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
no,
sir.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i
believe,
in
that
situation,
that
they
would
all
be
directors
because
they
form
what
is,
in
effect,
a
pool
or
perhaps
a
joint
venture
for
this
particular
purpose.
it's
something
like
a
partnership
in
this
situation
and
i
believe
that
if
a
director
engages
in
that
form
of
endeavor,
then
the
people
who
join
with
him
in
it,
because
of
the
danger
of
the
use
of
inside
information,
should
likewise
be
held
liable
under
section
16
(b).
this
danger,
i
cannot
overemphasize
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
yes,
sir.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
no,
we
would
not,
because
under
the
admittedly
arbitrary
test,
the
arbitrary
rule
of
thumb
is
16
(b),
that
would
be
irrelevant.
i
wonder
if
i
may
dwell,
for
a
few
moments,
upon
the
reality
of
this
danger
because,
to
us,
he
reality
of
the
danger
is
brought
into
very
sharp
focus
by
the
very
facts
of
this
case
and
its
predecessor,
rattner
against
lehman.
and
i
believe
counsel
for
petitioner
told
you
that,
in
rattner
against
lehman,
a
partner
of
lehman
brothers
was
held
liable
only
for
his
pro
rata
share
of
the
profits
of
a
short-swing
transaction
and
securities
of
the
corporation
at
which
he
was
a
director.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
1952
at
january,
i
believe.
now,
the
testimony
in
this
case
shows
that
when
joseph
thomas,
the
director
of
tide
water,
learned
of
the
lehman
brothers'
purchase
of
tide
water
equity
securities,
he
went
to
his
partner,
robert
lehman,
and
asked
him
the
purpose
of
the
transaction.
and
upon
being
told
the
purpose,
thomas
apparently
stated
that
it
might
prove
embarrassing
for
him
because
of
his
tide
water
directorate.
the
response
of
robert
lehman
is
very
interesting
and
quite
significant.
he
said,
“well,
you,”
meaning
thomas,
“had
better
do
something
about
it.”
robert
lehman
didn't
suggest
that
lehman
brothers
should
do
anything
about
it
and
indeed,
why
should
he,
because
he
had
rattner
against
lehman
as
a
precedent
before
him
only
approximately
three
years
before.
and,
under
rattner
against
lehman,
while
john
hertz,
his
partner,
was
forced
to
give
up
a
small
amount,
his
pro
rata
share
of
the
profits
in
the
consolidated
vultee
aircraft
transaction
which
was
the
subject
of
that
decision,
robert
lehman
made
money
and
as
did
every
other
partner
of
lehman
brothers,
including
joseph
thomas.
now,
he
has
the
tide
water
transaction
before
him
and,
this
time,
it's
joseph
thomas'
turn
to
lose
a
little
money.
but,
robert
lehman
makes
money,
as
do
all
of
the
other
partners
of
lehman
brothers,
including
john
hertz,
who
more
than
recoup
what
he
made
out
of
his
losses
in
the
consolidated
vultee
transaction
which
gave
rise
to
rattner
against
lehman.
now,
when
does
this
cycle
end?
who
is
to
say
it
will
ever
end?
if
this
court
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
in
the
first
place,
sir,
rattner
against
lehman
was
a
decision
of
the
second
circuit.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
we,
at
the
sec,
do
not
feel
compelled
to
run
to
congress
every
time
we
get
an
adverse
result
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
a
large
amount
of
it
has
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
certainly,
a
large
amount
of
it
has,
but
we
felt
it
was
proper
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
since
this
was
only
one
circuit,
to
wait
and
see
when
it
would
happen
again.
now,
as
to
our
reporting
to
congress,
we
did
report
the
results
of
rattner
against
lehman
in
our
annual
report
in
1952,
at
which
time
it
was
still
on
appeal
and
we
simply
reported
it
--
or,
rather,
1951.
in
our
annual
report
for
1952,
which
run
some-253
pages,
we
devoted
8
lines
to
explaining
simply
the
result
of
rattner
against
lehman,
which
is
what
we
normally
do.
all
the
divisions
in
the
commission
make
a
report
to
congress
which
is
included
here.
in
the
case
of
the
general
counsel's
office,
which
is
responsible
for
litigation,
they
simply
result
--
report
the
results
of
that
litigation.
they
do
not
go
ahead
and
make
recommendations
and
indeed,
on
the
basis
of
a
single
circuit
court
opinion
here,
it
would
have
been
highly
unusual
if
we
had.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
we
believe
the
evil
is
every
bit
as
portentous
as
i
have
told
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
will
say
this.
in
rattner
against
lehman,
our
hands
were
tied.
we
were
appearing
amicus
in
that
case
and
we
could
not
bring
it
up
to
the
supreme
court.
we
could
not
petition
that
for
cert
as
an
amicus.
now,
it
only
took
three
years
for
this
situation
to
develop
again
with
the
very
same
defendant.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
and
we
have
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i
believe
sir
that
it
is
not
safe
to
assume
that
the
danger
is
minimal
if
this
court
upholds
blau
against
lehman
because
if
this
court
upholds
blau
against
lehman,
you
are
going
to,
in
effect,
give
license
to
the
investment
bankers
and
any
other
kind
of
a
partnership
to
engage
in
this
type
of
transaction.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i
believe
we
might
well
regard
the
decision
of
this
court
as
something
more
significant
than
an
opinion
of
a
single
circuit,
sir.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i
repeat,
i
believe,
we
may
well
take
a
different
attitude.
but,
back
to
the
danger
again
because
that
is
important,
it
is
there,
we
got
robert
lehman
making
money
in
two
transactions
and
there's
no
indication
of
where
this
might
stop.
he
can
have
successive
transactions
or
his
partnership
can.
now,
it
may
well
be,
speaking
hypothetically,
that
they
will
continue
and
we
say
that
it
may
well
be
something
more
than
hypothetical
if
this
court
upholds
the
second
circuit
in
this
case.
but,
if
they
do,
there
can
be
a
succession
of
transactions.
maybe
in
one
of
them,
in
some
future
date,
robert
lehman
will
lose
money
if
lehman
brothers
trades
in
an
equity
security
of
a
corporation
of
which
he
is
a
director.
but,
that
won't
matter
to
him
because
it
will
be
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
bundle
of
money
that
he
has
made
in
prior
transaction
and
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
bundle
which
he
can
make
in
future
transactions.
we
say
that
the
type
of
result
which
the
second
circuit
decision
will
encourage
is
very
little
different
than
the
pooling
arrangements
which
were
so
roundly
condemned
by
the
senate
report
which
preceded
the
securities
exchange
act.
in
these
pooling
arrangements,
investment
bankers
and
insiders
were
often
involved
and
we
believe
that
the
senate
report
accurately
characterized
these
pooling
arrangements
as
vicious,
as
predatory,
and
as
flagrant
violations
of
fiduciary
duties.
it
is
true,
as
respondent's
brief
asserts,
that
the
when
section
16
(b),
or
what
ultimately
became
section
16
(b),
was
first
introduced
into
congress,
it
contained
a
provision,
first,
which
barred
any
insider
from
disclosing
confidential
information
and,
second,
impose
short-swing
liability
on
any
person
--
any
person
to
whom
that
disclosure
was
made.
now,
this
provision
was
sweeping
in
character,
and
plainly,
it
could
have
embraced
partners
or
directors.
but,
it
was
so
sweeping
that
it
could
have
embraced
friends,
relatives,
barbers,
bartenders,
bootblacks,
or
anyone
else
that
you
would
care
to
name.
and,
the
reason
it
was
deleted
is
because
it
would
have
required
proof
of
disclosure
and
that
proof
of
disclosure
made
it,
as
the
respondent's
brief
concedes,
a
dubious
administrative
practicality.
now,
the
respondent
argues
from
that
that
its
elimination
means
that,
obviously,
congress
intended
to
exclude
from
the
operation
of
section
16
(b)
partners
of
directors,
but
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
elimination
of
a
broad
provision
because
of
administrative
difficulties
of
enforcement
actually
reflects
a
congressional
intent
to
construe
what
remains
in
section
16
(b)
broadly.
and,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
conclusion
finds
ample
support
in
the
history
of
judicial
interpretation
of
section
16
(b).
in
fact,
you
have
filed
with
you
in
this
case
a
brief
amicus
from
the
american
society
of
corporate
secretaries
and
i
believe
a
reading
of
that
brief
and
the
cases
they
cite
will
clearly
indicate
that
the
cases
which
give
them
so
much
pain
prove
our
point,
namely,
that
never
--
nearly
every
court
which
has
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
section
16
(b)
as
recognized
that
it
is
necessary
to
construe
it
broadly
in
order
not
to
frustrate
its
plain
statutory
purpose.
i
might
add
that,
while
we
are
obviously
urging
a
broad
construction
on
you
today
suggesting
that
you
find
that
lehman
brothers
is
a
partner
within
the
meaning
of
section
16
(b),
that
we
don't
regard
this
as
an
extraordinarily
novel
or
startling
interpretation.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
is
a
director,
i
beg
your
pardon.
we
think
this
type
of
reasoning
find
support
in
other
cases,
notably,
those
consistently
rendered
under
section
249
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
i'm
sure
the
court
recalls
that
under
section
249,
no
compensation
shall
be
allowed
to
any
committee
or
attorney
or
their
person
acting
at
a
bankruptcy
or
reorganization
proceedings
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
who
buys
or
sells
stock
of
or
claims
against
the
debtor.
now,
the
statutory
purpose
behind
section
249
is
comparable
to
that
of
section
16
(b).
the
congress
recognized
that
active
participants,
in
say,
a
chapter
10
reorganization
proceeding
were
in
a
position
to
have
access
to
information
not
generally
available
to
the
public.
and
in
order
to
bar
the
use
of
that
inside
information,
they
enacted
a
arbitrary
standard,
a
rule
of
thumb,
if
you
will,
similar
to
that
in
section
16
(b)
saying,
“if
you
buy
or
sell,
you
can
receive
no
allowance.”
again,
under
249,
as
in
section
16
(b),
good
faith
is
irrelevant.
lack
of
use
of
inside
information
is
no
defense
and
the
cases
have
interpreted
this,
at
least
as
broadly
as
we
are
asking
you
to
interpret
section
16
(b).
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
or
other
fiduciary
capacity
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
--
which
means
anyone
who
has
entered
an
appearance
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
--
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
no,
sir,
although
i
don't
regard
that
as
exactly
a
catch-all
capacity.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
it
refers
to
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
other
fiduciary
--
well,
fiduciary
capacity
means,
we
believe,
a
participant
in
the
proceeding
who
is
neither
an
attorney
nor
a
member
of
the
committee.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
we
don't
have
one
precisely
comparable,
sir.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
that's
right.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
thank
you.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
at
the
close
yesterday,
i
was
discussing
section
249
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
has
an
underlying
statutory
purpose
comparable
to
that
of
section
16
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
mention
briefly
two
cases
which
are
cited
at
page
23
of
our
brief.
neither
of
these
cases
involves
the
phrase
“other
person
acting
in
the
proceedings
in
a
representative
or
fiduciary
capacity,”
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
regards
as
a
catch-all
and
i
do
not.
in
the
first
of
these
cases,
the
midland
united
case,
chief
judge
biggs
in
the
third
circuit,
although
he
was
there
sitting
on
the
district
court
for
the
state
of
delaware,
held
that
a
protective
committee
member
could
not
receive
an
allowance
because
a
corporation
which
he
was
president
bought
and
sold
the
debtor's
securities.
and,
the
court
made
this
holding
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
committee
member,
as
president
of
the
corporation,
had
no
interest
therein
which
would
entitle
him
to
share
the
profits.
and
in
the
los
angeles
lumber
products
company
case,
the
court
there
held
that
a
partnership
was
not
entitled
to
an
allowance
for
its
services
to
the
estate
because
a
partner
unconnected
with
the
chapter
10
reorganization
proceedings
there
concerned
had
traded
in
the
debtor's
securities.
and,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
court
in
that
case
observed
that
its
application
of
section
249
may
seem
harsh
and
may
work
a
hardship
on
innocent
persons,
but
the
court
held
that
the
rule
must
be
severe
in
order
to
be
effective
and
we
urge
upon
this
court
that
the
application
of
section
16
(b)
must
be
severe
in
order
to
be
effective.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i
would
answer
that
this
way,
mr.
justice
stewart.
if
lehman
brothers
incorporated,
as
you
know
some
investment
banking
firms
have
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
and
operated
in
the
same
way
that
it
now
operates
as
a
partnership,
the
commission
would
urge
upon
this
court
that
the
stockholders
of
that
corporation
who
would
hold
interest
comparable
to
the
partnership
interest
should
be
held
liable.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
the
corporation
would
be
a
director,
as
would
they.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i
think
that's
a
good
way
of
putting
it,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
want
to
observe
--
excuse
me,
mr.
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
well,
the
phrases
are,
sir
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
“committee
or
attorney
or
other
person
acting
in
the
proceedings
in
a
representative
or
a
fiduciary
capacity.”
now,
that
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
no,
sir.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i
believe
that
the
absolute
liability
imposed
by
section
16
(b),
in
effect,
makes
a
director
a
fiduciary.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
not
the
reverse
but,
in
this
case,
i
believe
that
joseph
thomas,
being
a
partner
of
lehman
brothers,
has
the
effect
of
making
the
partners
of
lehman
brothers
and
lehman
brothers,
the
partnership.
we'll
say,
fiduciaries
without
portfolio,
perhaps.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
not
precisely.
learned
hand,
in
the
rattner
case,
had
reservations
because
he
felt
that
if
it
were
shown
that
lehman
brothers
deputized
john
hertz,
deputized
him
to
go
on
the
board
of
directors,
he
might
reach
a
different
result.
our
position
here
today
is
that
deputisi
--
deputization
makes
no
difference.
we
say
the
mere
fact
that
he
is
a
director
and
is
a
partner
brings
the
partnership
within
the
scope
of
liability.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
i'm
saying
that
and
i'm
also
referring
to
the
fact
that
16
(a)
of
the
exchange
act
refers
to
any
person
who
is
a
director
and
section
3
(a)
(9)
defines
“person”
to
embrace
partnership.
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
because
section
16
(b)
refers
to
such
beneficial
owner,
director,
or
officer
and
the
“such”
relates
back
to
every
person
who
is
a
director
in
section
16
(a).
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
no,
sir,
it
would
not
be
broader.
it's
coextensive
with
16
(a),
but
“person”
obviously
has
to
mean
something
more
than
an
individual
because,
for
example,
in
magida
against
continental
can,
continental
can,
a
corporation,
was
a
beneficial
owner
of
more
than
10%
of
the
capital
stock
of
vulcan
detinning
company.
and
the
second
circuit
there
had
no
difficulty
holding
continental
can
a
person
for
purposes
of
section
16
(b).
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
to
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
two
courts
below
have
concluded
that
there
was
no
deputizing
and,
while
i
think
that
conclusion
is
somewhat
unrealistic,
we
are
willing
to
accept
it
because
we
don't
think
it's
necessary.
may
i
say
this,
that
we're
not
here
concerned
with
the
concepts
of
who
is
or
is
not
a
director
within
the
meaning
of
traditional
state
corporation
law.
what
we're
here
concerned
with
is
who
can
properly
be
included
within
the
term
“director”
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
statutory
purpose
of
a
provision
of
what
might
be
regarded
as
federal
incorporation
law
because
i
believe
the
court
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
--
is
aware
--
mr.
allan
f.
conwill
well,
i
believe
the
court
is
aware
that
it
has
been
judicially
observed
that
the
several
securities
laws
have,
in
effect,
created
a
sweeping
body
of
federal
statutory
corporation
law
which
brings
into
being
managerial
duties
and
liabilities
wholly
unknown
to
the
common
law.
and
we
say,
in
order
to
interpret
this
statute
properly,
in
order
to
carry
out
its
obvious
purpose,
that
it
is
proper
to
consider
lehman
brothers
the
partnership
as
a
director.
it
does
seem
to
us
also
that
basic
principles
of
fairness
would
demand
that,
in
this
type
of
situation,
a
partner
who
is
a
director
and
his
partnership
should
abstain
from
trading
when
he
is
in
this
position.
and,
we
believe
the
essence
of
this
basic
principle
of
fairness
has
been
codified
in
section
16
(b).
