mr.
levy.
justice
potter
stewart
this
legislation
did
not
apply
to
insiders
such
as
directors,
officers,
and
majority
stockholders,
did
it?
it
applied
specifically
and
expressly
and
exclusively
to
directors,
officers,
and
stockholders
who
held
10%
or
more
of
the
equities
--
securities,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
didn't
say
insider
such
as
these
people?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
i
just
--
you
told
us
that's
the--
justice
potter
stewart
as
defined?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
under
the
statute,
a
director
must
disgorge,
even
though
he
were
completely
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
also
under
the
statute,
a
stockholder
who
owns
only
9%
of
the
stock
is
not
affected
by
the
statute
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
no
matter
how
much
inside
knowledge
he
used?
justice
potter
stewart
what
16
(b)
have
--
or
the
exchange
act
have
to
say
about
disclosure
or
nondisclosure,
nothing,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
liability
on
whose
part?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if,
instead
of
telling
lehman
brothers
--
what
if
instead
of
lehman
brothers,
his
partners
purchased
and
sold
these
securities,
what
if
his
brother
had,
who
was
not
his
partner?
and
let's
assume,
if
you
think
it's
relevant
at
all,
that
he
had
given
his
brother
a
lot
of
inside
information.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
makes
that
entirely
irrelevant,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
more
people
have
brothers
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
than
have
partners,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
there
are
more
people
with
brothers
than
there
are
people
with
partners,
aren't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
probably,
the
danger
is
greater
telling
your
brother
than
it
is
of
telling
your
partner.
it
would
happen
more
often.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
instead
of
a
brother,
let's
take
a
wife.
what
if
he
told
his
wife?
justice
potter
stewart
and
his
wife
had
made
--
had
bought
--
had
been
in
a
position
to
buy
$50
million-worth
of
securities
and
turn
a
short-swing
profit
of
$100,000.
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
was
really
getting
at,
mr.
conwill,
was
only
this.
you
stated
these
four
conceded
uncontested
facts
and
acted
as
though
that
was
kind
of
a
qed
under
this
statute
and
i
just
was
wondering
if
it
was
a
qed.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
that
particular
case
has
got
quite
a
different
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
that
case
was
decided
about
10
years
ago.
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
think
--
to
answer
your
question,
don't
you
think
it's
for
congress
to
say?
rattner
has
been
on
the
books
for
10
years.
the
sec
makes
periodic
reports
to
congress,
tells
them
all
about
the
rattner
case.
don't
you
think
it's
for
congress
to
say
when
this
is
--
when
the
law
is
going
to
be
changed?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
hasn't
--
haven't
--
hasn't
about
90%
or
more
of
this
litigation
under
this
statute
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
precedence
i
could
find
were
second
circuit
precedence.
justice
potter
stewart
this--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
conwill,
what
if
lehman
brothers,
instead
of
being
a
partnership,
were
a
corporation
and
an
officer
of
the
corporation
were
in
the
position
of
mr.
thomas,
the
director
here,
would
all
the
stockholders
of
lehman
brothers
be
directors
of
the
tide
water
associated
oil
company
under
16
(b)?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
seymour,
is
lehman
brothers
all
--
are
lehman
brothers
also
investment
advisers?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
lehman
corporation
is
something
quite
different.
justice
potter
stewart
although
it
does
have
the
same
--
it
could
mean
the
same
personnel,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
co-owner.
