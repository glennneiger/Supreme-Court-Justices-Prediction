justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
point
that
he
made
it
up,
is
that
your
point?
suppose
there
hadn't
been
any
made
up,
just
in
this
tide
water
transaction,
and
mr.
thomas
forewent
his
share
in
the
partnership
--
in
the
distributed
shares
of
the
partnership.
he
said,
“in
lieu
of
my
relation
to
tide
water,
i'm
not
going
to
take
a
penny
of
profit
out
of
that
which
has
come
to
the
firm
out
of
tide
water's
dealing.”
therefore,
there'd
be
more
in
the
pool
left
to
be
distributed
among
those
partners
who
are
in
tide
water
oil
case.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow
that.
i
had
in
my
mind
the
recent
experience
of
one
of
the
most
pristine
investment
office
in
england,
one
of
the
partners
of
which
was
a
member
of
the
governors
of
the
bank
of
england.
he
was
under
obligations
to
make
no
revelation
to
--
to
his
other
partners.
in
this
country,
was
that
against
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know.
i'm
asking
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
situation
i
put
to
you,
in
that
troublesome
case
in
england,
it
couldn't
happen
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
specific
provision
in
the
new
york
partnership
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
reading
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
the
director
of
a
company
who
is
a
partner
in
a
firm
must
tell
all
his
fellow
directors,
his
fellow
partners,
business
of
the
firm
of
which
he
is
a
director.
is
that
what
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
he's
under
--
the
statutory
duty
is
not
to
make
that
disclosure,
not
to
give
off
confidential
information
in
his
director's
role,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
that
makes
some
differences.
there's
a
statutory
duty
of
one
partner
to
tell
all
the
inside
information--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
corporation
of
which
he's
a
director.
that
may
have
a
bearing
on
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
already
on
demand.
that's
already
a
qualification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
interpret
that
new
york
statute
in
this
case
in
its
fullness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
levy,
can
you
tell
without
arguing
it,
just
unequivocally,
can
you
tell
whether
new
york
has
the
entity
theory
of
a
partnership?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
is
the
new
york
law
based
on
an
entity
conception
of
a
partnership?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know,
is
it
capable
of
being
to
say
yer
or
no?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
can't
--
they
can't
be
quite
as
loose
that
you've
just
put
it
because
the
danger
in
the
hypothesis
given
by
justice
stewart,
if
it's
merely
a
question
of
danger,
then
you
could
be
with
the
brother
and
the
wife
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
look
at
the
specific
--
if
that's
the
test.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
you
have
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
do
have
to
go
back
and
consider
--
if
i
refer
--
if
i'm
tied
with
the
implication
of
the
remark
you
just
made
--
do
we
have
to
go
back
to
conceptions
of
the
partnership's
relation
and
to
see
the
general
condition
of
a
partnership?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
word
“person”
in
16
(b)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
how
does
that
definition
help
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
is
the
partnership
a
director?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
lehman
brothers
was
a
partnership
of
this
concern,
of
this
corporation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
vital
to
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
want
to
make
a
fine
point
of
it,
but
you
have
to
say
it
is
a
part
--
that
it
is
a
director,
not
equal
to,
but
a
director.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
if
the
evil
is
of
greater
(inaudible)
and
here
it
is.
that's
the
whole
point
of
having
an
adverse
decision
by
a
court
in
which
this
kind
of
litigation
dissented,
reaching
such
a
disastrous
result
and
not
asking
for
remedies,
and
i
think
it
foregoes
this
case.
all
i'm
saying
is
you
--
your
suggestion
that
you
don't
run
to
congress
every
time
you
have
an
adverse
decision,
i
commend
you
for
doing
that,
but
not
if
the
evil
is
as
portentous
as
you
tell
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
developed
at
the
time--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
is
it
developed
at
the
time,
and
presumably
it's
a
safe
rule
of
life
that
people
would
go
on
doing
the
same
thing.
that's
the
general
principle
which
i
have
been
curious
to
verify.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you,
again,
are
going
to
rest
that
it's
not
your
business
to
run
to
congress
every
time
you
get
an
adversed
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
merely,
the
second
circuit
by
the
judge's
dissent
in
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
had
a
generalized
catch-all
phrase
or
other
fiduciary
relationship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
any
such
catch-all
phrase
in
16
(b)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
on
any
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
fiduciary
capacity
meaning
we
have
to
construe
what
a
fiduciary
capacity
is
and
that
isn't
easily
fit
into
(inaudible),
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
comparable
phrase
is
there
in
16
(b)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
conwill,
the
claim
procedure
that's
not
--
have
talked
about
whether
the
thing
is
a
catch-all
or
not,
but
under
your
bankruptcy
act,
there
was
a
phrase
less
restrictive
--
there
was
a
phrase
that
isn't
as
restrictive
as
direct
inference.
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
phrase
in
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
very
well
that
--
who
is
and
who
isn't
a
fiduciary
in
the
subject
matter
that
your
commission
has
had
to
deal
with
and
this
court
has
had
to
deal
with.
in
the
(inaudible)
case
we
indicated,
if
the
commission
at
least,
were
clear
to
me,
if
the
commission
as
a
matter
of
its
own
cumulative
experience
could
say
that
a
protective
committee
is
in
a
fiduciary
relation,
that
gave
it
scope
--
that
should
gave
it
scope
so
to
hold.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
--
it
was
a
very
different
thing.
in
the
first
(inaudible)
case,
they
say
that
it's
established
by
a
credible
principle.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
there
is
in
this
statute
that
gives
that
leeway
of
construction
that
you
have
in
phrase
like
“in
a
fiduciary
relation”
or
“a
fiduciary
transaction.”
now,
when
congress
uses
words
like
“director,”
it
doesn't
mean
“or
anybody
else
having
a
fiduciary
relation,”
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
suppose
you're
contending
that.
you
contended
that
lehman
brothers,
on
partnership,
what
shall
i
say,
speculation
--
partnership
notions
or
the
--
is
that
the
partnership
was
a
director.
but,
you're
not
contending
that
there's
anything
comparable,
in
turn,
a
category
in
16
(b)
comparable
to
the
concept
of
a
fiduciary
relation.
there
are
instances
of
fiduciary,
but
is
there
a
category
of
fiduciary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
director,
of
course,
is
a
fiduciary,
but
is
every
fiduciary
a
director?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
that
that
is
the
consequence
to
the
legal
relation
of
partners
intercede?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
the
word
“person.”
it
doesn't
exist
in
16
(b).
how
do
you
bring
six
--
how
do
you
bring
the
definition
of
“person”
into
16
(b)
unless
they're
in
corporation
by
reference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
is
no
particularization
required
in
16
(b).
if
“person,”
as
defined
above,
include
almost
everybody
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
gather,
you
do
not
contend
that
on
this
record,
there
was
a
deputizing
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
deputizing
has
any
meaning
other
than
people
of
partners,
and
then
you
don't
have
to
talk
about
deputizing.
there
wasn't
that
something
difference,
was
there,
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means,
federal
incorporation
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
seymour
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you
this
question,
which
you
can
deal
with
whenever
it
fits
into
your
--
the
architecture
of
your
argument.
could
the
commission
explicitly
formulate
into
a
regulation,
under
implementing
powers
of
issuing
regulations,
a
prohibition
that
would
explicitly
take
care
of
this
situation
--
this
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
by
“kind,”
i
mean
a
class
of
precisely
this
type
of
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
it
can't
do
that,
but
would
it
be
--
in
other
words,
would
that
be
extending
the
term?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
the
commission
had
general
powers
of
regu
--
of
issuing
regulations
consistent
with
the
scope
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
therefore,
i
should
think,
within
limits,
i'm
speaking
quite
irresponsible
in
sense,
but
i
don't
know.
within
limits,
i
should
think
they
could
define
--
they
couldn't
say
that
the
counsel
for
the
--
for
a
firm
is
a
director
of
the
firm
and
he
isn't
a
director,
but
i
should
think
they'd
have
a
little
leeway
of
who
is
a
director
if
within
certain
corporate
relationships,
some
directors
can't
vote,
for
instance,
nonvoting
directors.
i
should
think
they
could
define
who
are
directors
without
offending
the
general
concept
of
what
a
director
is,
wouldn't
you
think
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
--
are
these
merely
financial
partnerships?
do
they
--
would
this
cover
legal
partnerships?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
members
of
the
law
firm
or
directors
of
a
corporation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
not
a
unique
phenomenon,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
that
regulation,
mr.
seymour?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
would
there
be
any
difference
in
the
consideration
between
a
law
firm
director
or
all
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
legal,
all
the
legal
implications
of
a
partnership,
would
there
be
any
difference
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
a
case
of
a
partner,
in
one
of
the
many
various
new
york
law
firms
who
have
hold
directorship?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
suggestion
was
it
would
be
his
duty
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
all
partnership
--
all
firm-partnership
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
seymour,
that
was
(inaudible)
element
in
view
of
justice
black's
interventions,
i
hope
i
did
not
imply
that
i
regard
that
as
the
most
desirable
aspects
of
their
legal
profession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
make
any
such
implications.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
irrelevant
to
say
something,
i
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
as
such
that
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
instructions
in
conflict
with
this
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
levy,
“the
lily
was
gilded,”
is
that
a
conclu
--
a
finding
of
facts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
frequently
the
fate
of
people
who
disagree
with
the
majority,
i
know
that
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
is
a
director.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
is
“a
director”
under
16
(b),
which
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
a
beneficial
owner?
is
it
a
director?
is
it
an
officer
by
reason
of
his
relationship
to
the
issuer?
which
one,
or
as
i
gather
from
your
argument,
though
i
for
myself
think
most
abstract
discussions
of
statutory
construction
and
not
very
profitable,
but
i
gather
in
your
argument,
it
was
that
the
purpose
behind
this
provision
is
so
important
to
the
public
interest
as
disclosed
by
the
disclosure
preceding
its
enactment
that
the
condemnation
and
the
right
to
sue
under
the
statute
isn't
restricted
to
those
three
categories.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't
restricted
to
what
the
statute
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
classified?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
are
you
reading?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
25
(a)
--
125?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that,
an
offer
of
proof?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
pursue
that
question
and
asked
--
did
you
pursue
that
question
and
make
clear
that
you
had
other
specific
transactions
in
mind
and
get
his
views
on
them
or
his
testimony
regarding
it?
