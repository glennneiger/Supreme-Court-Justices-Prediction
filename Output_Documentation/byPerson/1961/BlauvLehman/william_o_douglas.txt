was
the

regulation
enforced
when

justice
william
o.

the
one
that
was
enforced
when
this
transaction
took
place
is
the
one
that
you
printed
on
page
53
of
your
brief?
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
that
one
on
page
53
later
recalled?
justice
william
o.
douglas
partnership
under
the
act
is
a
--
is
it
a
person?
i
forget
the
definition.
justice
william
o.
douglas
meaning
“director”?
justice
william
o.
douglas
except
the
word
“such”
that
carries
you
back
to
16
(a)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
is
the
same
position
i
gather
with
learned
hand
took
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
rattner
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
16
(b)
wouldn't
be
broader
than
16
(a)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
i
understand
it,
mr.
seymour,
the
commission
has
nothing
--
no
function
to
perform
here,
has
it,
except
the
filing
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
filing
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
and
public
disclosure.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
--
the
sanction
of
16
(a)
and
16
(b)
were
--
lies
in
suits
by
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
they
did,
however
--
the
commission
couldn't
start
the
suit.
justice
william
o.
douglas
at
this
point,
mister,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
of
course,
this
whole
scheme,
16
(a)
and
16
(b),
is
pretty
arbitrary
in
many
respects
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
starting
it
off
at
9.9%
and
so
on.
in
terms
of
the
body
of
law,
either
at
the
administrative
level
or
at
the
court
level,
is
it
necessary
to
show
that
--
to
prove
that
the
inside
information
was
used?
isn't
there
or
is
there
a
presumption
or
a
conclusive
presumption?
justice
william
o.
douglas
even
though
he
got
the
--
made
the
purchase
as
a
result
of
a
ouija
boards?
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
do
you
deal
with
justice
jackson's
opinion
in
the
--
was
it
the
mosser
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
it
was
a
case,
i
think,
as
i
remember,
that
arose
under
the
bankruptcy
act
where
a
trustee
did
just
--
just
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
mr.
seymour.
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
i
might
have
to
assume
that
law
firms
these
days
are
taking
short-swing
profits?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
a
partner
--
law
partners,
i
assume,
keep
the
$50-fee
for
directors
and
they
keep
it
themselves,
so
