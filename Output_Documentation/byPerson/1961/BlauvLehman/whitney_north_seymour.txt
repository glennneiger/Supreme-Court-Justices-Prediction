mr.
whitney
north
seymour
do
i
precede
the
government
on
this,
your
honor?
the
government
is
here
as
amicus
curiae.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
rather
assume
the
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
--
government
would
go
next.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
problem
presented
by
this
case
is
a
simple
one
and
i
shall
not
take
much
of
the
court's
time.
the
question
posed
is
whether
the
court
should
extend
the
language
of
section
16
(b)
of
the
1934
act
so
as
to
embrace
the
partners
of
a
director
and
make
them
directors
so
that
the
profits
on
a
short-swing
transaction
are
recoverable
in
this
kind
of
an
action.
now,
the
decision
below
was,
i
think,
in
accord
with
the
--
both
the
judicial
and
administrative
construction
of
the
act
prior
to
that
time.
the
position
taken
by
my
friend
from
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
today
is
very
much
more
extreme
than
any
position
taken
before
and
i
think
inconsistent
with
the
administrative
construction
which
the
commission
has
followed
before.
indeed,
i
think
it's
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
was
taken
by
the
commission
in
its
brief
amicus
in
support
of
the
petition
here
because,
there,
they
said
it
is
not
necessary
to
urge
that
the
partners
become
a
director
and,
yet,
that
is
the
key
of
their
position
today.
now,
the
court
below
followed
a
decision
in
the
second
circuit
rendered
in
1952
in
rattner
against
lehman,
a
decision
by
a
strong
court
composed
of
hand
and
judge
swan.
prior
to
that
decision,
the
regulation
of
the
commission
under
this
statute
provided
that
partnerships
owning
securities
might
file
either,
in
effect,
a
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
they
might
file
either
the
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
the
director
might
file
either
on
the
basis
of
the
partnership
interest
or
his
interest
in
the
partnership,
and
the
rattner
case
was,
in
part,
predicated
upon
that
regulation.
after
the
rattner
case,
the
regulation
was
modified
to
the
extent
that
the
partner
was
required
to
show
the
partnership
interest.
he
might,
if
he
liked
to,
show
his
own
interest
in
the
partnership
but
in
a
release
issued
contemporaneously
with
the
regulation.
the
commission
indicated
that
it
was
not
departing
from
the
principles
in
rattner
against
lehman
and,
therefore,
until
the
commission
participated
below
or
sought
to
participate
below,
the
commission
then
adhered
to
an
acceptance
of
the
principle
of
rattner
against
lehman,
or
at
least
i
think
that's
a
fair
construction
of
their
administrative
procedure.
now,
below,
judge
clark
in
his
dissent
strongly
invited
the
commission
to
participate,
although
they
hadn't
participated
before,
and
they
sought
to
participate
on
rehearing
and
were
denied
that
opportunity,
and
then
joined
in
the
application
for
certiorari
here.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
should
now
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
should
very
much
doubt
if
the
commission,
by
regulation,
could
extend
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
would
think
so.
but
the
congress,
in
a
penal
statute
which
was
a
web
of
presumptions,
laid
it
down
that
certain
people
should
be
absolutely
liable
for
short-swing
profits,
directors,
officers,
and
stockholders
of
10%.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
sir,
to
lay
down
the
regulations
about
filing
and
public
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
--
disclosure.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
but,
it
was
in
that
connection
that
the
commission,
in
my
view,
accepted
the
decision
in
rattner
against
lehman.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that's
quite
correct.
now
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that's
right,
but
the
commission
did
have
a
function
about
the
--
those
who
must
disclose,
in
the
manner
of
disclosure,
and
was
in
that
connection
that
they
adopted
rattner
against
lehman,
i
submit.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
sir.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
perhaps
so,
but
the
statute
defines
who
is
a
director.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
now,
let
me
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it's
in
our
brief,
if
your
honor
pleases,
and
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
have
it
--
i
have
it
here.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i'll
give
you
the
page
in
just
a
second.
page
--
the
statement
appears
at
page
23
of
our
brief.
yesterday,
mr.
levy,
i
thought,
was
a
little
over
exuberant
in
his
statement
of
the
facts
here
and
he
made
no
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
were
findings
by
the
two
courts
below,
and
i'm
not
going
to
take
up
what
i
think
are
some
errors
in
the
facts
that
he
made
because
i
think
the
findings
were
--
the
things
the
court
will
be
concerned
with
here
and
my
friend
from
the
commission
has
correctly
said
that
among
those
findings
was
a
finding
that
there
was
no
deputization
to
mr.
thomas.
the
other
findings
--
the
other
main
findings
are
that
thomas
became
a
director
at
the
instance
of
tide
water.
while
his
name
had
been
originally
suggested
by
mr.
hertz,
the
retiring
director,
the
choice
was
made
by
tide
water.
furthermore,
the
transaction
which
gave
rise
to
these
profits
was
one
with
which
mr.
thomas
had
no
connection
whatever.
the
investment
committee
of
lehman
brothers
of
which
he
was
not
a
member,
reading
in
the
wall
street
journal
of
the
fact
that
tide
water
propose
to
have
an
exchange
of
common
stock
for
preferred
stock,
decided
to
buy
some
of
the
common
stock
with
the
objective
of
exchanging
it
and
selling
the
preferred
stock
to
institutional
investors.
it's
found
that
no
confidential
information
was
passed
on
by
thomas
to
his
partners,
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
decision
to
enter
into
this
transaction
and
did
not
know
of
it
until
the
purchases
began
and,
as
soon
as
he
learned
of
it,
he
disassociated
himself
entirely
from
the
transaction.
so
that,
the
case
before
the
court
involves
none
of
the
evils
at
which
this
statute
was
aimed.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
don't
know
quite
how
to
answer
you,
mr.
justice.
the
petitioner
pays
no
attention
whatever
to
the
findings
and
quotes
from
the
record
sometimes
correctly
and
sometimes
incorrectly
without
regard
to
the
findings.
the
commission
says
that
some
of
the
findings
include
conclusions,
and
they're
not
finding
on
the
court,
although
the
conclusions
that
they
refer
to
include
the
alleged
conclusion
that
there
was
no
deputies
--
deputization
and
now
they
accept
that
finding.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
don't
either.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
don't
either.
may
i
come
to
that
because,
at
the
end
of
my
argument,
i
want
to
discuss
the
learned
hand
dictum
in
the
rattner
case?
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
there's
a
conclusive
presumption
under
the
statute
that
if
you
got
the
right
person,
if
you're
suing
the
right
person,
if
he's
a
director
or
an
officer
or
a
10%-stockholder
and
he
made
short-swing
profits,
he's
liable
without
regard
to
whether
there
was
any
use
of
confidential
information.
the
reason
i
mentioned
the
finding
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
right,
but
the
reason
i
mentioned
it
is
to
satisfy
the
court
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
they
should
extend
the
statute,
unless
the
statute
requires
extension
by
its
plain
terms.
now
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
when
you
say
his
principals,
i
think
you
get
into
a
problem
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
particular
circumstance
which
should
give
rise
to
some
liability
on
an
agency
theory.
we
don't
have
anything
of
that
kind
here.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it's
a
general
partnership
and
the
partner
is
the
agent
of
the
partnership
for
certain
partnership
purposes,
but
not,
i
submit,
as
a
director
of
a
corporation.
and
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
yes.
and
the
findings
are
that
he
was
not
a
representative
of
lehman
brothers,
not
a
deputy
of
lehman
brothers
as
a
director.
he
was
not
chosen
that
way.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
am.
now,
counsel
for
the
commission,
i
submit,
is
quite
right
in
saying
that
the
only
way
liability
can
be
imposed
on
lehman
brothers
is
to
treat
it
as
a
director,
and
i
want
to
say
a
few
words
about
why
that
could
not
be
done.
first,
it's
very
odd
indeed,
whatever
body
of
federal
corporate
law
there
may
be,
to
treat
a
partnership
for
any
purpose
as
a
director
and
so
we
start
with
a
proposition
that
it's
a
very
odd
result.
and
then,
you
look
at
the
statute,
section
7
--
subdivision
7
of
section
3
(a),
appearing
at
page
2
of
our
brief
and
we
find
this
definition.
the
term
“director”
means
any
director
of
a
corporation
or
any
person
performing
similar
functions
with
respect
to
any
organization,
whether
incorporated
or
unincorporated.
so,
to
make
lehman
brothers
a
--
or
its
other
partners
a
director,
would
require
proof
that
they
were
performing
similar
functions
with
respect
to
tide
water.
now,
there's
no
such
proof
in
this
record.
there's
the
kind
of
proof,
one
would
think,
that
would
be
required
to
accomplish
even
that
rather
odd
result
would
be
proof
that
the
director
was,
in
effect,
the
dummy
director
carrying
out
instructions
or
at
least
consulting
as
to
corporate
decisions
with
those
whom
he
was
representing.
now,
there's
nothing
of
that
kind
in
this
record.
there's
absolutely
no
basis
for
concluding
that
lehman
brothers
was
performing
--
or
any
of
its
other
partners
were
performing
any
similar
function
to
that
of
a
director
and,
therefore
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
it's
not
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it's
not
quite
in
the
record,
i
think,
if
your
honors
pleases.
it's
something
that
counsel,
and
i
believe
the
commission,
have
referred
to
as
something
from
the
commission's
record.
lehman
brothers
are
an
investment
banking
firm.
they
provide
investment
banking
services.
their
partners
served
on
many
board
of
directors
and
the
companies
on
whose
boards
they
served
often
have
lehman
brothers
do
underwriting
business
for
them.
but
i
submit
that
that
does
not
make
lehman
brothers
a
director,
and
that's
the
point
that's
before
your
honors.
now,
it's
perfectly
clear
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that's
entirely
different,
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
but
it's
a
quite
separate
organization.
now,
it's
clear
from
this
record
that
it
was
thomas'
view
that
it
would've
been
quite
improper
for
him
to
discuss
with
his
partners
the
detail
of
the
corporate
business
of
the
corporation
of
which
he
was
a
director
and
that
he
did
not
do
so.
now,
counsel
on
the
other
side,
yesterday,
made
a
brief
reference
to
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision.
it's
clear
that
it
was
aimed
at
eliminating
the
evil
of
insider
manipulation,
but
congress
considered
quite
carefully
how
to
do
that.
and,
there
was
a
proposal
to
reach
way
beyond
what
the
present
statute
reaches
and
reach
those
who
got
unused
confidential
information
and
that
proposal
was
eliminated
after
consideration
of
the
difficulties
of
its
enforcement.
now,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it
was
eliminated
because
of
its
difficulties
or
for
other
reasons.
there
was
a
proposal
that,
in
order
to
recover,
there
should
be
proof
and
the
proof
was
regarded
as
a
difficulty.
and,
if
i
understand
my
friend
from
the
commission,
he
argues
that
when
congress
eliminates
such
a
provision
because
of
difficulty
of
enforcement,
the
court
ought
to
expand
the
construction
of
what
congress
left
where
there
is
no
problem
of
proof.
in
other
words,
expand
the
area
of
conclusive
presumption
because
congress
decided
it
ought
not
to
include
a
provision
where
proof
was
required,
and
i
submit
that's
an
extraordinary
result
of
the
elimination
by
congress
of
that
provision.
in
rattner,
the
court
considered
the
legislative
history
and,
on
that
ground
among
others,
decided
that
partners
had
been
excluded
as
a
result
of
the
congressional
determination.
now,
my
friend
on
the
other
side
says
on
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
i
think,
suggests
this
problem,
that
a
partnership
ought
to
be
regarded
as
a
director
but
if,
instead
of
doing
business
as
a
partnership,
the
banking
organization
decided
to
do
it
as
a
corporation
and
one
of
its
officers
was
a
director,
then
all
the
stockholders
would
become
directors.
well,
that's
a
pretty
extraordinary
result.
it's
very
unusual
to
have
a
corporation
act
as
a
director
and
still
more
unusual
to
have
that
kind
of
an
attribution.
but,
what
about
the
case
of
the
wife
and
the
brother
that
mr.
justice
stewart
put
yesterday?
if
the
court
ought
to
try
to
remedy
an
evil
here
by
extending
the
statute,
why
not
wives
and
brothers
and
uncles
and
everybody
else?
they're
all
the
people
that
congress
excluded,
and
i
submit
that
there's
no
stopping.
and,
here,
congress
passed
a
penal
statute
with
a
conclusive
presumption,
selected
those
who
were
to
be
liable,
and
i
submit,
there's
no
basis
for
extending
it
beyond
that.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
don't
know
that
i'm
prepared
to
deal
with
the
result.
i
don't
--
it
hasn't
been
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i'm
afraid
i
would
not
like
to
discuss
that
case
with
your
honors
(inaudible)
because
i'm
not
prepared
to
it.
now,
the
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes?
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
was
planning
to
come
to
that
in
a
moment
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
--
but
i'll
come
to
it
now,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i'll
come
to
it
right
now.
counsel
--
mr.
levy
said,
in
effect,
that
these
waivers
were
going
on
all
the
time
and
the
result
of
that
was
that
everybody
could
fill
their
nest.
counsel
for
the
commission
indicated
that
this
was
a
very
grave
evil
that
mr.
robert
lehman
and
others
were
always
back-scratching
in
getting
money
this
way,
and
so
on.
now,
there's
not
anything
in
this
record
to
sustain
anything
of
that
kind.
the
only
reference
to
any
other
waiver
is
a
reference
to
financing
for
airlines
where,
under
the
cab,
the
director
is
not
entitled
to
participate
in
underwriting
fees,
which
is
a
very
different
thing.
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
of
any
general
waiver
of
profits
made
by
insider's
transactions.
the
only
other
case
that
is
before
the
court,
perhaps,
is
the
rattner
case
where
mr.
hertz
had
a
profit
of
some
$900.
in
this
case,
the
profit
of
mr.
thomas
was
some
$3,000
or
thereabouts.
and,
mr.
hertz
turned
over
that
money
to
the
corporation.
there's
no
evidence
of
such
general
violation
and
i
submit
that
for
a
court,
in
the
teeth
of
these
findings
or
even
for
counsel
in
the
teeth
of
these
findings,
to
suggest
anything
to
the
contrary
is
quite
wrong.
furthermore,
the
sec
has
regularly
filed
with
it,
monthly,
statements
of
all
such
transactions
and
if
there
was
such
any
horrendous
evil,
as
counsel
has
suggested
to
your
honors,
the
commission
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
seeking
legislation
and
they
should
do
it.
and,
i
submit
the
fact
that,
since
1952
when
rattner
was
decided,
they
have
seen
no
occasion
to
go
to
congress
for
a
relief.
it
shows
on
its
face
that
there's
no
such
evil
and
the
fact
is,
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
that
in
my
view,
they
accepted
rattner
and
i
want
to
come
to
that.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
would
submit,
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
if
since
1952,
with
monthly
filings,
the
commission
is
unable
to
show
and
the
plaintiff
was
unable
to
show,
having
access
to
the
commission's
public
records,
that
there
was
such
any
evil,
the
evil
is
wholly
imaginary
and
if
there
is
an
evil,
it's
for
congress
to
cure
and
not
to
be
cured
by
distorting
the
language
of
the
statute.
now,
i
want
to
come
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
sir.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
my
recollection
is
that
those
paragraphs
of
the
notice
to
admit
which
were
rejected
as
an
offer
of
proof
by
the
court
below
and
i
don't
understand
that
that's
one
of
the
grounds
on
which
certiorari
was
sought
here.
those
paragraphs
concern
other
episodes
in
which
lehman
brothers'
partners
became
directors
of
other
corporations.
and,
the
court
below
correctly
rejected
that
as
wholly
irrelevant
to
this
case.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
shouldn't
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
now,
as
to
rattner,
very
briefly
and
i'm
almost
through.
as
i
told
your
honors,
prior
to
rattner,
the
regulation
contemplate
--
the
regulation
published
by
the
commission
contemplated
that
the
partner
could
file
showing
the
partners
--
the
partnerships,
as
investments,
or
his
own
investments
and
the
court
adopted
that
regulation
as
one
of
the
grounds
of
its
decision.
perhaps
i
better
read
the
precise
regulation
to
your
honor
because
i'm
going
to
read
the
next
one.
this
is
the
regulation
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
rattner
and
is
taken
from
the
rattner
opinion.
“a
partner
who
is
required
to
report
in
respect
of
any
equity
security
owned
by
the
partnership
may
include
in
his
report
the
entire
amount
of
such
equity
security
owned
by
the
partnership
and
state
that
he
has
an
interest
in
such
equity
security
by
reason
of
his
membership
in
the
partnership
without
disclosing
the
extent
of
such
interest,
or
such
partner
may
file
a
report
only
as
to
that
amount
of
such
equity
security
which
represents
his
proportion
of
interest
in
the
partnership
indicating
that
the
report
covers
only
such
interest.”
now,
that
was
surely
a
recognition
by
the
commission
of
the
appropriateness
of
treating
the
partner
as
only
“only
his
own
interest”
and
the
court
regarded
that
as
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
placed
some
reliance
on
it.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well
i
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
suppose
so.
i
suppose
so.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
and
it's
not
a
unique
phenomenon
to
have
a
law
firm
partners
as
directors
of
corporations.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
now
the
regulation
after
rattner,
i
submit,
really
in
effect
was
--
it
can
be
fairly
regarded
as
an
adoption
of
the
commission
--
of
the
principle
of
the
rattner
case
or
at
least
an
indication
that
the
commission
did
not
propose
to
quarrel
with
them,
and
the
release
is
--
the
release
with
reference
to
rattner
is
in
the
brief
at
page
21,
as
i
refer
to
the
chief
justice,
and
that
new
regulation
is
stated
to
be
a
regulation
in
the
interest
of
disclosure.
and,
the
commission
in
the
contemporaneous
release,
which
has
never
been
withdrawn
so
far
as
i
know,
said
it
is
not
intended
as
a
modification
of
the
principles
governing
liability
for
short-swing
transactions
under
section
16
(b)
as
set
forth
in
the
case
of
rattner
against
lehman.
but
it
is
based
upon
the
belief
that
full
disclosure
requires
a
report
of
all
partnership
transactions
when
an
officer,
director,
or
a
10%-stockholder
of
the
issuer
is
a
partner.
now,
i
submit
that
the
reason
the
commission
didn't
ask
congress
to
change
the
result
in
rattner
is
because
they
were
content
with
it
and
were
content
with
it
indeed
until
judge
clark
stirred
them
up
to
participate
in
this
case.
and,
if
they
had
any
quarrel
with
that
decision,
if
they
thought
there
was
any
evil,
they
should
have
gone
to
congress
to
correct
it.
now
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
regulation
is
september
--
that
release
is
september
24,
1952.
1952,
so
that,
until
the
decision
of
the
court
below
when
the
commission
first
busied
itself
in
getting
into
this
litigation,
it
did
not
busy
itself
about
it
when
judge
dawson
decided
the
case
against
the
petitioner,
but
only
after
the
dissent
in
the
court
below.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
page
21.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
beg
your
pardon,
page
24.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
sir?
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
i
don't.
i
don't.
well
now,
i'm
almost
through
and
i'll
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
wouldn't
think
so.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
wouldn't
think
so,
and
the
obligations
to
the
corporation
and
the
obligation
to
the
partnership
would
be
the
same,
i
should
think.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
but
i
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
--
i
think
the
bar
would
be
very
much
surprised
to
learn
that
it
had
an
obligation,
as
mr.
levy
suggested,
to
disclose
to
the
partners
everything
that
any
member
of
a
board
learn
as
a
director.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
--
and
there's
no
such
basis
--
no
basis
to
furnish
those
things.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
perfectly
obvious
and
i
--
i
should
submit
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
--
that
that
isn't
so.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
mr.
justice,
you're
a
survivor
of
a
day
which
is
a
happier
day.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
i
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think,
in
view
of
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think,
in
view
of
a
number
of
stockholder
suits
in
the
last
25
years,
most
lawyers
would
feel
that
way,
too.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
now
finally,
there
are
references
in
the
briefs
to
judge
medina's
decision
in
the
banker's
case,
a
very
long
opinion
in
which
he
deals
with
various
aspects
of
banking
in
new
york
and
petitioner
seeks
to
incorporate
by
reference
some
of
the
things
in
that
opinion
and
this
case
as
if
they've
been
proved
in
this
record,
and
judge
medina
correctly
said
below
that
that
was
irrelevant
to
anything
here.
they
refer
to
a
cab
statute
and
the
fact
that,
under
the
cab
statute,
a
lehman
brothers
partner
has,
for
certain
purposes,
been
regarded
as
a
representative
of
the
partnership.
now,
this
merely
points
out
the
fact
that
when
congress
wanted
to
use
a
word
to
describe
something,
it
knew
how
to
do
it
and
if
it
wanted
to
include
partners
or
representatives
or
anything
of
that
kind,
there
are
statutes
in
our
brief
which
show
that
they
could
do
it.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
such,
of
course,
doesn't
do
anything
except
to
refer
to
16
(a)
and
it
doesn't
expand
the
group
as
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
in
the
question
he
asked.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
my
understanding
is
that,
early
in
1961,
the
commission
passed
over
into
a
series
of
instructions
about
the
filing
of
reports
and,
whether
that
resulted
in
a
revocation,
i'm
not
quite
sure.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
sir,
i
think
not.
i
think
they're
in
accord
with
the
regulation
and
there's
a
reference
to
them
in
our
brief.
and
certainly,
down
to
1961,
when
the
commission
began
to
busy
itself
with
this
litigation,
there
wasn't
any
departure
from
the
principles
of
those
regulations
in
anything
i
know
of
that
the
commission
said
it
did.
now
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it
was
a
release
in
connection
with
the
regulation
which,
i
take
it,
states
the
basis
on
which
the
regulation
was
made.
and
i
take
it,
it's
an
explication
of
the
regulation.
certainly,
it's
an
official
act
of
the
commission.
now,
my
friend
mr.
levy
has
reserved
a
rather
more
than
usual
time
for
rebuttal,
and
i
want
to
anticipate
two
points
which
he
may
refer
to
on
rebuttal
in
the
course
of
this
extended
time
of
which
have
not
heretofore
been
mentioned,
i
think.
first,
there
was
some
suggestion
in
judge
clark's
dissent
that
maybe
the
--
thomas
--
thomas
could
be
held
liable
for
all
of
lehman
profits,
all
the
other
partners'
profits
because
he
was
a
co-owner
of
partnership
property.
now,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
get
into
the
complication
of
partnership
law
here,
but
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there's
a
distinction
between
ownership
in
specific
property
and
an
interest
in
the
partnership
and
the
partner,
under
the
uniform
partnership
act
which
is
in
effect
in
new
york,
is
a
co-owner
of
specific
partnership
property
but
he
can't
dispose
of
it.
it
is
not
subject
to
the
claims
of
his
creditors
and
obviously,
the
profits
of
the
partnership
are
not
on
that
category
--
they're
in
the
category
of
interest
in
the
partnership.
and,
his
interest
in
the
partnership
is
his
right
to
share
in
the
profits.
the
statute
refers
to
profits
realized
by
him.
it
cannot
refer
then
to
something
that
he
couldn't
possibly
deal
with.
it
must
be
when
the
profit
has
been
realized
by
him.
second,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
want
to
come
to
the
deputization
point
which
you
and
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
me
about.
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
rattner,
judge
learned
hand,
recognizing
that,
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
there
wasn't
any
possible
ground
for
holding
lehman
brothers
reserved
for
a
future
consideration
the
situation
which
might
exist
if
there
was
deputization
of
a
director
to
represent
the
partnership
interest,
and
he
didn't
define
what
he
meant
by
that
at
all.
the
court
below,
judge
medina
and
judge
swan,
said
there
wasn't
any
room
in
this
statute
for
any
conception
--
such
conception
as
that.
the
statue
doesn't
refer
to
deputies,
but
the
directors,
officers,
and
stockholders.
but
there's
a
specific
finding
of
fact
by
both
court
below
that
there
wasn't
any
deputization.
so
whatever
it
means,
it
didn't
exist
here.
now,
i
suppose,
what
it
must
mean,
if
the
doctrine
is
over,
is
a
case
where
a
stockholder
designates
somebody
to
represent
him
on
the
board
and
directs
his
conduct
in
that
event.
judge
hand
suggests
that
you
might
get
a
different
result.
i
don't
see
any
basis
for
it
under
the
statute
but,
in
any
event,
that
was
not
the
situation
here
and
that's
dispositive
of
the
--
of
the
case
on
that
point.
now,
i
submit,
the
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
sir.
the
judgment
against
thomas
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
judge
swann
thought
that
the
judgment
was
somewhat
larger
than
it
should've
been
and
we
haven't
sought
certiorari.
i
have
just
one
other
point.
the
court
below
denied
interest.
both
courts
below
denied
interest
upon
the
ground
that
thomas
was
being
charged
more
than
he
actually
realized
by
way
of
profit
and
the
question
was
a
difficult
one,
and
fairness
did
not
require
that
interest
should
be
imposed,
we
think
that
was
right.
