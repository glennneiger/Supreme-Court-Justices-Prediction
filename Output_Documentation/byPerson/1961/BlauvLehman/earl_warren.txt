petitioner,
versus
robert

et

mr.
levy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
seymour.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
whichever
order
--
whichever
order
you
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
agreed
before.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
conwill,
will
you
proceed
first,
yes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
conwill.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
mr.
seymour,
i
think
we
are
ready
for
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
seymour,
is
that
statement
that
was
contemporaneous
with
the
regulation
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
bother
to
find
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'll
find
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
seymour,
while
we're
on
that
general
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
subject,
may
i
ask
this
question.
counsel,
yesterday,
suggested
that
in
this
case,
the
director-partner
did
not
return
to
the
corporation
the
share
that
he
would
be
liable
for,
but
he
put
it
into
partnership
funds
and
all
the
rest
of
the
partners
profited
from
his
action,
concededly,
as
in
violation
of
the
--
of
the
law.
now,
there
being
100
directors
in
other
corporations,
as
is
suggested,
and
that
each
of
them
does
the
same
thing
and
that
money
is
always
distributed
between
the
partners
other
than
the
single
one
who
you
concede
is
liable
for
his
part
that,
in
the
end,
they're
doing
exactly
what
the
--
what
the
law
prohibits
and
all
of
them,
including
the
director-partner
in
this
case,
would
be
obtaining
a
benefit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
wait.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
it
in
your
own
time.
i'm
in
no
hurry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
question
was
not
directed
at
what
was
in
the
record,
but
we
were
discussing
what
such
an
interpretation
would
lead
to
under
certain
circumstances.
you
said
suppose
it's
a
husband
and
wife,
suppose
it's
a
brother
and
a
sister,
suppose
it's
some
other
relationship,
and
my
question
was
only
to
this.
suppose
this
practice
was
done,
as
they
say,
would
that
not
give
some
substance
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
levy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
waived
in
favor
of
the
other
partners?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
