justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
lead
us
thus
far?
suppose
mr.
thomas
had
been
killed
over
a
period
--
over
the
period
when
all
these
transactions
occurred.
in
consequence,
he
was
not
able
to
give
any
attention
either
to
his
duties
as
director
or
as
partner,
yet
resigned
from
neither
position,
would
you
be
taking
any
different
position
for
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
is
a
“partner,”
is
a
“director.”
