justice
john
m.
harlan
does
it
appear
that
they
dropped
it
because
of
administrative
difficulties
or
because
they
didn't
approve
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
does
that
appear?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
understand
that.
you
say
that
they
got
some
extra
volume
from
their
partnerships
as
the
substitute
for
what
would
have
been
their
interest
in
the
short-swing
profit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
10%

owner?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
in
the

what?

justice
john
m.
harlan
directors
without
portfolio,
so
to
speak.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
judgment
against
thomas
is
not
involved
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
swan
dissented
on
--
judge
swan
dissented.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
your
argument
apply
to
a
limited
partner?
justice
john
m.
harlan
even
though
he
had
no
interest
in
the
profits
of
the
firm,
that
they
it
might
represent
the
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
limited
partner
is
excluded
from
--
the
limited
partner-director
is
excluded
from
all
such
business
under
the
terms
of
its
limited
partnership.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
even
carry
that
far?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
do
you
con
--
do
you
attack
the
findings
of
the
two
lower
courts?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
sort
of
a
secondary
argument.
in
other
words,
your
basic
position
is
consistent
with
accepting
the
fact,
do
you
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
just
wanted
to
make
it
clear
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
myself
clear.
your
basic
position
is
the
same
as
the
commission,
is
it
not?
they
say
they
accept
the
findings
and
(inaudible)
that
it
should've
been
in
the
judgment
against
the
partnership.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
if
your
attack
on
the
findings
is
rejected,
the
findings
of
two
courts
are
rejected,
are
you
still
in
the
court
with
all
your
concerns?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
court
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
wanted
to
get
at.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood.
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
you've
got
the
hurdles
of
--
the
findings
of
facts
which
were
against
you
on
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
do
with
“realized”?
justice
john
m.
harlan
profit
realized?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
realized
by
him.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
said
that
the
question
is,
“it
couldn't
be
possible?”
and
he
said,
“yes,
it
couldn't
be
possible.”
and
then,
he
ends
up
and
says,
“yes,
it
occurred
right
here.”
so,
you
end
up
saying
that
this
meant
--
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that,
so
far
as
testimony
is
concerned,
except
this
transaction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
different
kind
of
a
transaction
than
the
one
that
you're
referring
to
at
the
bottom.

john
m.
