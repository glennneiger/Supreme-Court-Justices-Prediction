justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
probable
cause
questions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
an
argument
in
this
case,
don't
you?
this
is
silber,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
point
3,
are
you
going
to
argue
on
that?
you
better
look
and
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gathered
the
government's
position
as
whatever
meaning
it
had
does
not
have
the
meaning
it
has
in
fourth
amendment
cases
or
in
arrest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
it
does?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
when
you
say
he
ran
for
office
on
the
communist
party
ticket,
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
i
know,
both
mr.
davis
and
amter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
in
those
days,
it
was
quite
legal
for
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
communist
party.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
rabinowitz,
i
gather
you're
not
arguing
or
perhaps
you
are
when
i
ask
the
question.
are
you
arguing
that
whatever
their
information
was,
they
had
to
make
known
that
--
make
that
information
known
to
the
petitioner
before
they
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
they
subpoenaed
him,
they
must
in
fact
have
had
information
which
would
constitute
whatever
probable
cause
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
before
they
could
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
follow.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
shelton
may
have
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
shelton
who
has
just
been
anonymous
letter
in
the
file.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
mr.
terris,
if
--
i'm
starting
this
with
if
the
fourth
amendment
standards
for
probable
cause
were
applicable
here,
if
they
were,
is
the
government's
position
that
the
information
in
this
memorandum
will
satisfy
those
standards
of
probable
cause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
why
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
it
could
start
with
if,
i
would
say,
if
they
were.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
trying
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
the
(voice
overlap)
--
documents,
the
sentence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what
you've
just
read
from
oklahoma
case
that
you
have
reasons
to
(inaudible)
reasonable
cause
for
belief
that
the
contents
of
the
documents
are
relevant.
now,
if
you're
going
to
apply
that
test
in
the
case
of
a
person
whose
testimony
you
want
then
you
ought,
i
would
suppose,
also
we
required
to
have
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
he
can
tell
you
something,
is
that
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
upon
the
inquiry.
and
what's
the
test
of
whether
he
may
have
reason
to
believe
he
can
testify
in
a
way
which
will
be
relevant
to
the
inquiry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
what
the
court
was
saying
in
the
barenblatt
case
but
what
i
was
trying
to
find
out
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
thought
what
we
were
discussing
mr.
terris
is,
what
is
if
the
committee
has
to
know
about
a
prospective
witness
before
properly,
they
may
subpoena
him
under
that
testimony
of
the
barenblatt
case
that
you've
been
repeating
to
it
over
and
over
all
day.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
mr.
terris
what
mr.
arens
testified
too
that
it
had
information
and
it's
filed
as
to
the
communist
party
of
membership
petitioner,
is
that
which
later
will
develop
in
cross-examination,
is
it
not
the
information?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
(inaudible)
from
the
new
york
times
in
this
report
of
mr.
russell
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
all
that
--
that's
all
he
was
referring
to,
was
it
at
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
maybe,
my
memory
doesn't
serve
me
but
i
thought
what
they
were
after
there
where
the
--
in
effect
the
registry
of
the
hotel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
all
with
the
background
of
much
correspondents
between
dr.
uphause
and
the
other
people.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
he
was
relying
on
what
--
on
that
same
statement
from
barenblatt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
as
i
recall
the
shelton
argument,
i
think
the
government's
position
there
was
that
even
an
anonymous
letter
he
said
somebody
by
the
name
of
shelton
at
the
new
york
times
we
think
as
a
communist,
was
sufficient
test
--
to
support
subpoenaing
shelton
to
come
down
and
testify.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
have
--
we
don't
have
reliable
informant
here,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
you
don't
rely
on
the
one
but
his
son
whose
first
name
was
unknown
was
also
identified
at
new
york
times.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
all
there
was,
you
wouldn't
think
he
was
a
member?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
was
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
let's
see,
we
know
that
if
they
pick
him
up
off
the
street
that
isn't
enough
and
that
if
they
merely
say
that
the
son
was
a
member,
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
we're
getting
somewhere.
