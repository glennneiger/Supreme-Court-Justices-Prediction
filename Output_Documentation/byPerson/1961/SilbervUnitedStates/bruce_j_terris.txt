mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
at
the
start,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
just
what
the
questions
were,
which
petitioner
refused
to
answer
because
they're
almost
identical
with
the
kind
of
questions
which
mr.
justice
white
suggested
with
the
kind,
it
could
be
answered
yes
or
no.
the
first
question,
and
this
is
our
page
3
of
the
record,
was
he,
and
now
that
you
have
brackets,
[the
person
who
recruited
defendant
in
the
communist
party]
of
communications
worker.
the
answer
to
that
is
yes
or
no.
it's
not
the
name
of
a
person.
now
the
fact
that
the
next
question
might
have
asked
the
name
of
the
person,
he
should've
--
if
he
was
going
object
to
identifying
people,
that
was
the
time
to
object.
you
can't
start
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
and
say,
“well,
i
know
what
you're
aiming
at
ultimately
and
that
therefore,
i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
questions
even
though
the
objection
i've
raised
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
questions
you're
now
asking.”
in
count
3,
where
any
of
the
officers
of
their
union,
members
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
you
were
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
answer
that
yes
or
no.
it's
not
--
nobody's
name
could
possibly
be
a
direct
answer
unless
you're
going
to
elucidate
the
answer.
in
count
4
it's
the
same
thing
where
any
of
the
present
officers
of
your
union,
members
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
that
you
were
in
the
party.
so
none
of
these
--
none
of
these
questions
involved
the
naming
of
names.
now,
it's
true
for
pertinency
purposes,
it's
arguable
that
we're
bound
by
the
explanation.
we
have
an
argument
that
we're
not
bound.
but
for
first
amendment
purposes
at
least,
we're
bound
by
what
the
questions
asked
for.
the
questions
did
not
ask
for
names.
the
first
amendment
issue
here
is
whether
a
committee
can
ask
a
witness
concerning
other
persons
after
all,
they're
barely
few
questions
that
don't
concern
other
persons
unless
you're
going
to
ask
the
man,
are
you
a
communist?
that's
just
about
the
only
question
you
could
ask
him.
if
you
ask
him,
“what
group
you
were
a
member
of
in
the
communist
party?”
that
concerns
other
persons.
if
you
ask
him,
“what
are
the
plans
of
the
communist
party?”
it's
almost
impossible
to
think
of
any
questions
other
than
his
personal
membership.
and
that
kind
of
a
question
if
it
were
the
only
thing
that
the
committee
was
interested
in
might
well
be
just
exposure
for
the
sake
of
exposure.
now,
the
context
of
petitioner
silber's
refusal
to
answer
is
the
same
as
that
of
petitioner
grumman.
and
therefore,
i
will
not
repeat
it.
the
committee
was
investigating
communist
activities
in
the
communications
industry
at
large
amounts
of
evidence
seduced
at
this
hearing
about
the
danger
from
this
kind
of
--
from
communist
in
the
industry.
petitioner
silber's
contentions
concerning
the
first
amendment
are
extremely
similar
to
those
of
petitioner
grumman
and
petitioner
yellin.
therefore,
the
government's
answer
is
virtually
the
same.
the
facts
are
virtually
the
same
as
those
in
barenblatt
and
braden
and
wilkinson
and
therefore,
we
submit
that
those
three
cases
are
controlling.
government
is
obviously
an
important,
vitally
important
interest
of
protecting
the
communications'
network
of
this
country
from
communist
subversion.
petitioner
silber
was
not
pillory.
the
questions
are
clearly
relevant.
now,
petitioner
silber's
main
contention
and
it's
hard
to
say
whether
it's
under
the
first
or
under
the
fourth
amendments
is
that
he
was
called
as
the
result
of
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures,
lacking
in
probable
cause
to
put
--
to
put
his
argument
into
the
terms
of
the
barenblatt
case,
and
i
assume
that
means
in
the
terms
of
the
first
amendment
and
not
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
may
say
at
the
start,
the
petitioner,
i
believe,
is
wrong
when
he
says
that
no
other
case
which
is
been
decided
by
this
court
involves
the
witness
which
who
had
not
been
identified
before
a
committee
and
sworn
testimony
as
a
communist.
my
reading
of
the
braden
case,
both
the
--
and
i
don't
have
the
record
here
but
the
government's
brief
certainly
relied
on
no
explicit
testimony
before
the
committee
stating
that
the
witness
was
a
communist
and
there's
nothing
in
the
opinion
which
says
that
there
was
any
such
testimony.
nevertheless,
this
court
stated
the
subcommittee
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
that
he
even
actively
engaged
in
propaganda
efforts.
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain
now,
that
statement
is
based
on
the
sworn
testimony
of
committee
counsel
after
witness's
trial.
and
we
not
only
have
that
testimony
here
but
we
have
additional
corroborative
documents
which
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
wilkinson
i
think
was
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
believe
that
so
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
believe
that
so.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
to
(inaudible).
now,
that
would
have
in
the
record
--
i
can't
positive
but
certainly
the
government
didn't
rely
at
any
sworn
testimony.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
very
briefly,
first
to
the
fourth
amendment
contention.
now,
this
is
argued
very
extensively
in
our
brief
just
as
it
was
in
the
shelton
case.
the
government's
contentions
are
essentially
and
very
briefly
three-fold.
first
of
all,
the
petitioner
did
not
raise
the
fourth
amendment
before
the
committee
and
therefore,
we
submit
that
he
cannot
raise
it
in
this
court
anymore
than
he
raise
the
first
amendment
issues,
pertinency
issues,
quorum
issues,
any
of
the
other
kinds
of
issues
which
he
may
might
have
made
before
the
committee.
he
did
raise
the
first
amendment
issue
and
therefore,
if
he
was
summoned
as
the
result
of
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures
lacking
in
probable
cause,
i'm
willing
to
assume
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
is
the
last
two
of
the
three
arguments
that
we
have.
our
second
argument
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
subpoenas
to
testify
at
all
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
and
if
it
does
apply.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
okay.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
it's
hard
to
know
what
if
you
say
that
it
applies
but
doesn't
have
any
content.
well,
i'm
going
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
third
--
the
third
argument.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
it
applies,
we
submit
that
the
standard
is
the
same
as
subpoena
duces
tecum.
this
court
has
held
in
the
oklahoma
press
publishing
company
case
versus
walling,
not
too
long
ago
in
327
united
states
that
the
requirement
of
probable
cause
supported
by
ought
to
reformation
literally
applicable
in
the
case
of
a
warrant
is
satisfied
in
that
of
an
order
for
production
by
the
court's
determination
if
the
investigation
is
authorized
by
congress
is
for
a
purpose
congress
can
order,
and
the
document
sought
are
relevant
to
the
inquiry.
now,
we
can
think
of
no
reason
why
congress
is
to
be
treated
worse
than
executive
agencies
or
that
the
standard
should
be
stricter
for
subpoenas
to
testify
the
subpoena
duces
tecum.
now,
applying
that
standard
here,
it
could
be
almost
--
it
almost
seems
that's
beyond
argument
that
it
says
so.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
okay,
investigation
is
authorized
by
congress.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
was
the
decision
in
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
is
for
a
purpose
congress
can
order,
that's
again
satisfied
by
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson.
the
document
sought
a
relevance
to
inquiry.
now,
i
have
to
substitute
it
for
documents
of
course
that
the
testimony
sought
is
relevant
to
the
inquiry
and
that
of
course
means
--
that
means
pertinency.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
okay
well,
i'm
going
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that
isn't
what
the
sentence
--
that
isn't
what
the
sentence
says
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
wait.
no,
it
doesn't
say
that
he
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
has
documents
which
are
relevant
to
the
inquiry.
it
says
the
documents
sought
are
relevant.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
i
--
i
think
i
cannot
agree
but
i'm
not
sure
--
i'm
not
sure
that
it
makes
a
difference
because
as
i've
said,
i'm
going
to
accept
under
the
first
amendment,
and
a
witness
can't
be
subpoenaed
if
that
is
the
result
of
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures
lacking
a
probable
cause.
it
seems
to
be
the
most
you
can
read
into
oklahoma
press
case
is
that
sentence
that
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
most.
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
oklahoma
press
stands
for.
it's
certainly
if
the
whole
opinion
is
taken
instead
of
just
the
sentence
that
i
read,
that
it
doesn't
--
there's
no
indication
there
that
you
have
to
have
any
elements
of
proof.
after
all,
you
could
--
you
could
have
had
a
requirement
there
of
proof.
you
could've
required
some
kind
of
a
showing
that
this
particular
man
and
after
all
subpoena
runs
to
a
man,
just
like
it
runs
to
a
man
here
doesn't
run
the
documents
that
you
could've
require
proof
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
as
i
see
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
as
i
see
your
honor,
i
want
to
get
into
a
sterile
argument
because
in
the
sense
that
i'm
not
sure
that
what
you've
said
is
any
different
than
what
really
the
court
was
saying
in
the
barenblatt
case
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
that
is
the
wording
of
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
let
me
say
this
sentence,
the
very
wording
of
the
barenblatt
case
is
not
too
far
from
what
you
said.
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
what
you
said
came
out
of
oklahoma
press.
after
all,
when
you're
asking
for
documents,
you're
specifying
particular
documents.
those
documents
are
relevant
to
the
inquiry.
you
don't
know
that
that
guy
has
the
documents,
why
do
you
ask
him
without
any
reasonable
ground
for
believing
he
has
some.
oklahoma
press
doesn't
say
that
the
executive
branch
has
to
have
that
kind
of
cause
to
ask
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
if
he
--
and
if
a
witness
doesn't
have
the
information
he
says,
“i
can't
answer.”
the
response
your
honor
is
precisely
the
same.
the
question
is
do
you
bother
somebody?
that's
really
the
argument
not
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right,
i'm
--
preliminary,
all
i've
meant
to
say
is
that
oklahoma
press
establishes
that
under
the
fourth
amendment
the
committee
doesn't
have
to
know
very
much.
under
barenblatt,
however,
i
would
--
as
i'd
indicated
before,
they
could
not
call
somebody
else
off
the
street
and
therefore,
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
specific
information
which
the
committee
had.
i
might
say
the
start
that
this
issue
comes
before
this
court
with
the
finding
by
the
district
court
on
all
the
evidence
that
there
was
good
cause
to
issue
the
subpoena
had
call
the
witness
before
the
committee
and
this
finding
was
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
all
we
have
to
establish
in
this
court
is
if
that
finding
wasn't
so
erroneous,
that
there
was
enough
evidence
in
this
record
for
our
committee
to
reasonably
believe
that
the
petitioner
had
information
to
contribute
to
the
committee's
investigation.
now,
committee
counsel
testified
at
the
petitioner's
trial.
if
the
committee
had
information,
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
engaged
in
the
communications
field.
that
is
the
kind
of
statement
with
somewhat
more
detailed
which
this
court
said
in
the
braden
case,
be
sufficient
to
call
a
witness.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
braden
case
stands
squarely
in
the
way
petitioner's
argument.
i
might
say
it
also
--
another
case
which
stands
in
a
ways
is
uphause
and
wyman.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
would
assume
that
so
i
--
in
braden
what
happened
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
sir
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
there
--
there
are
four
things
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
assume
that's
right.
in
braden
--
the
reason
i
say
in
braden,
there
was
less,
is
that
in
braden
all
you
have
is
the
conclusion.
you
had
no
idea
where
it
came
from.
here,
you
have
the
conclusion
and
i
assume
most
if
not
all
of
the
underlying
information
if
i
might
say
uphause
and
wyman
which
this
court
upheld
a
conviction
under
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
attack
that
there,
there
was
many
information
that
mr.
uphause
was
a
communist
at
all.
all
there
was,
is
an
indication
and
i
don't
think
even
that
--
and
there's
assuming
that
from
the
opinion
one
cannot
tell
that
this
was
sworn
before
committees,
but
there
was
information
that
communist
or
people
that
were
involved
in
communist
fun
activities,
well
of
course
may
not
even
be
communist,
had
been
guest
at
the
summer
camp.
yet,
this
court
held
that
there
was
ground
to
call
mr.
uphause
to
say
who
these
people
were.
i
may
say
that
there,
they
were
asking
--
they
were
asking
for
names
which
they
were
not
asking
for
here.
the
government
doesn't
think
there's
any
difference.
we've
argued
that
both
in
whitman
and
in
--
in
the
whitman
case
but
i
don't
--
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that's
right
your
honor.
i
will
say
that's
a
much
broader
kind
of
inquiry
than
is
involved
here.
particularly
of
a
man
who
wasn't
--
that
nobody
has
even
charged
this
far
as
i
know
at
least
and
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
case
indicates
with
being
a
communist
himself.
mr.
silber
is
not
only
charged
but
he
admitted
that
he
was
a
communist.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
think
--
i
think
probably
it's
a
technical
matter
that
it
is
not
eliminated,
that
the
essential
inquiry
is
what
the
committee
knew
prior
to
the
time.
just
as
in
the
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
case,
the
fact
that
you
find
narcotics,
it
doesn't
prove
that
you
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
premises.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
yes.
i
don't
think
its
--
put
it
way,
let's
say
they
just
talk
--
walk
up
to
a
guy
in
the
street
and
they
said,
“we'd
like
to
talk
to
you,
you
come
in”
and
they
announce
to,
“we
don't
have
a
slightest
idea
you're
a
communist,
are
you?”
he
said
“yes,
i'm
a
communist.”
i
would
think
that
in
that
case
under
what
barenblatt
says
that
there
was
an
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedure.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that's
of
course
a
difficulty
which
in
the
fourth
amendment
area
you
don't
have
because
in
the
fourth
amendment
area,
you
can
say
that
the
evidence
can't
be
--
can't
be
admitted.
here,
you
are
not
out
for
the
admission
unless
you're
trying
to
find
out
what
the
facts
are,
right?
i
agree
your
honor
that
it
would
be
hard
to
draw
a
rule
of
what
then
the
committee
would
be
expected
to
do.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
not
--
insofar
as
this
is
under
the
first
amendment
and
it's
very
--
it's
a
little
bit
hard
for
me
to
know
exactly
what
the
petitioner
is
raising
in
his
brief.
he
doesn't
mention
in
the
amendment.
he
doesn't
mention
what
legal
provision
he's
relying
on.
his
case
has
seemed
to
go
both
first
and
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
it's
not
quite
that
clear
from
the
brief.
i
think
now
he's
relying
both
on
the
fourth
amendment
and
barenblatt
which
i
read
is
the
first
amendment.
it's
not
slightest
mentioned
in
barenblatt
of
the
fourth.
if
that's
what
he's
relying
at,
we
don't
argue
this
without
standing
to
raise
the
first
amendment
issue.
he
raised
it
before
the
committee.
and
we
don't
think
that
you
could
require
a
witness
to
raise
all
the
particulars
of
your
first
amendment
issues.
so
insofar,
if
this
is
the
first
amendment
contention,
it's
--
we
believe
that
it's
properly
before
the
court.
we
do
not
think
his
fourth
amendment
contention
if
that's
what
he's
making
is
before
the
court
since
he
never
told
the
committee
about
this.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
one
additional
fact
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
the
letter
came
from
an
informant
who've
been
previously
found
to
be
reliable.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
don't
know
whether
he's
reliable.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
collaboration
which
we
did
not
have
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
collaboration
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
two
things
that
he
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
let
me
tell
the
fourth
state,
the
four
documents
in
which
we
rely.
the
first
is
the
petitioner
handled
the
government
including
secret
government
messages.
that
means
that
if
he
was
a
communist,
certainly
some
reason
to
call,
that
doesn't
help
as
some
whether
he
was
a
communist.
second,
the
second
one
was
the
petitioner
--
document
showing
the
petitioner
he
participated
in
the
nominating
process
of
a
person
on
the
communist
party
ticket.
now,
we
did
it
--
the
committee
didn't
call
12000
people.
he
called
a
person
that
had
participated
in
the
nominee
in
process
of
which
it
had
other
information
that
he
was
a
communist.
the
third
or
the
second
document
which
goes
to
whether
he
was
a
communist
was
this
news
article
from
new
york
times
stating,
i
assume
nobody
has
challenged
its
correctness
so
i'd
rather
not
deal
with
the
--
we're
dealing
with
the
new
york
times.
i
assume
we're
dealing
with
the
fact
that
a
lawsuit
was
filed
by
the
american
labor
party
against
petitioner
and
others
to
oust
them
from
the
american
labor
party
on
the
ground
that
they
were
allied,
that
they
were
affiliated
with
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
don't
rely
on
the
fact
that
his
son
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
but
i
rely
in
the
fact
that
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
that
--
i
mean
if
his
son
was
a
member,
that
isn't
of
course
what
it
might
--
the
emphasis
your
honor
of
the
sentence
that
you
read,
i
would
put
rather
differently,
it
was
also
identified.
i
assumed
that
means
for
the
confidential
source,
it
also
identified
mr.
silber
as
well
as
the
--
as
well
as
the
son
your
honor.
i
don't
--
if
it
just
said
his
son
was
identified
as
a
communist
then
i
wouldn't
rely
at
all
of
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
wouldn't
even
rely
in
there
for
collaboration.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
your
honor,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
with
all
--
with
all
respect,
i
don't
think
that
there
ever
has
been
a
case
in
which
the
committee
has
done
either
one
of
those
two
things.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
find
nothing
in
barenblatt,
wilkinson
or
braden.
however,
i
understood
mr.
rabinowitz,
if
i'm
correct
to
say
that,
that
isn't
his
contention
that
the
committee
did
not
err
in
failing
to
state
its
grounds
to
him.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'd
like
to
state
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
our
view,
the
committee
has
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
either
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
that
he
was
closely
allied
to
the
communist
party
and
we
think
it
would've
certainly
been
enough
if
he'd
even
been
closely
affiliate
with
the
communist
party,
surely
likely
he
would
had
information
about
communist
activities.
the
government
has
its
second
contention.
we
believe
that
even
if
the
committee
did
not
have
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
the
petitioner
was
a
communist,
it
certainly
could
reasonably
believe
that
he
had
information
to
contribute
to
its
investigation,
which
is
all
that
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
required.
the
petitioner
was
admitted
a
long
time
member
of
the
american
communications
association
and
a
long
time
communications
worker,
41
years.
the
committee
had
overwhelming
evidence
that
the
president,
secretary
treasurer,
vice
president,
newspaper
editor
and
other
high
officials
of
the
american
communications
association
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
and
therefore,
we
think
he
was
reasonable
for
the
committee
to
subpoena
petitioner
even
if
he
hadn't
been
a
communist
to
testify
about
what
he
knew
about
communist
control
of
the
american
communications
association.
this
isn't
an
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedure.
i
suppose
if
there's
any
--
that
this
man
as
much
as
anyone
would
know
whether
the
communist
party
was
directing
and
controlling
the
american
communications
association.
and
it
seems
to
us,
that's
all
that
barenblatt
requires,
that
the
person
reasonably
have
information,
so
even
if
he
hadn't
turned
out
to
be
a
communist,
the
committee
certainly
was
reasonable
in
subpoenaing
him
because
of
what
he
could
expect
was
his
knowledge
of
the
american
communications
association
and
the
industry.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
he
was
not
an
officer,
he
was
a
long
time
member.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
and
there's
no
--
and
there's
no
indication
that
he
--
that
he
was
ignorant
of
the
affairs
of
the
american
communications
association.
after
all,
the
committee
had
before
it
indications,
well
the
cio's
expulsion
order
for
that
matter,
indications
that
the
--
american
communications
association
followed
the
communist
line.
its
high
officers
were
communist.
somebody
who
was
long
time
in
the
association
certainly
would
be
likely
to
have
something
to
contribute,
that
at
least
he
might
have
--
he
might
be
able
to
answer
the
two
questions
involved
in
counts
three
and
four
that
he
know
of
--
essentially,
that
he
know
of
any
of
the
person
officers
of
the
association
were
--
they'd
been
communist.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
petitioner's
contention
that
the
first
amendment
was
violated
because
the
committee
was
seeking
information
concerning
other
persons.
i've
indicated
briefly
at
the
start
of
my
argument
that
we
think
this
intention
is
without
any
merit
at
all.
in
brief,
our
argument
is
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
but
it
wasn't
raised
in
this
court.
so
that
i
assume
therefore
the
--
the
issue
was
not
before
the
court.
it
wasn't
raised
either
in
the
petition
or
in
the
briefs
in
the
merits.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
but
it's
not
before
this
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
form
yes
sir
--
yes
your
honor.
but
in
form,
the
indictment
is
the
same
with
almost
every
other
indictment
in
this
field.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
not
yellin
--
not
yellin
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
--
i
think
the
six
and
the
four
all
have
the
same
form.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
it's
a
defect,
they
have
the
same
defect
and
it
was
properly
raised
unlike
by
petitioner
silber
and
it's
properly
before
the
court,
yes
your
honor.
i
think
it
isn't
only
the
district
of
columbia.
i
think
that
the
indictment
in
the
wilkinson
case
is
also
substantially
similar.
and
in
the
braden
case,
it
was
the
same
except
for
this
other
issue
your
honor
about
willfulness
versus
the
refusal
being
unlawful.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
yes.
and
it
made
--
well,
i
guess
watkins
came
(inaudible).
the
government's
position
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pertinency
was
raised.
two
issues
as
to
pertinency
are
before
the
court.
i
haven't
got
any
dealt
of
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
rabinowitz
is
a
much
more
skillful
counsel
then
that
your
honor.
in
all
these
cases,
we
have
seven
clear
issues
raised
as
to
having
the
requirement
that
you
state
the
subject
under
inquiry
in
the
indictment,
this
case,
it
is
not
raised.
i
don't
know
the
reason
why
it
isn't
raised,
but
it
isn't.
it's
hard
to
believe
that
mr.
rabinowitz
meant
his
contentions
as
to
actual
pertinency
in
a
price
of
a
pertinency
to
go
to
the
indictment.
if
he
did
it,
it's
unusually
unskillful
such
able
counsel.
petitioner
silber
in
our
view
has
no
special
first
amendment
rights
because
he
was
questioned
about
other
persons,
his
rights
are
still
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
association
which
this
court
held
in
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
do
not
allow
a
witness
to
refuse
to
testify
concerning
communist
activities.
and
in
addition,
petitioners
own
first
amendment
rights
could
not
have
been
infringed
here,
because
he
testified
concerning
his
own
activities.
therefore,
petitioner
silber
is
candid
in
admitting
that
it's
essentially
his
argument
rest
on
the
fact
that
his
self-respect
and
self-esteem
require
he
claims
that
he
not
act
as
an
informer.
the
government
submits
that
this
moral
scruples
worthy
as
they
maybe
in
some
circumstances,
in
some
particular
circumstances
have
never
been
recognized
by
this
court
or
as
far
as
we've
been
able
to
ascertain
by
any
other
court
as
a
legal
defense
under
the
first
amendment.
on
the
contrary,
there's
a
well-established
part
of
our
jurisprudence
that
a
citizen
has
a
legal
and
civic
duty
to
testify
before
properly
constituted
authority
as
to
matters
within
his
knowledge
even
if
the
expense
of
his
friends.
and
we
submit
that
it's
frivolous
even
to
suggest
that
a
witness
whether
it's
before
a
grand
jury,
in
a
criminal
trial
or
before
a
congressional
committee
can
simply
refuse
to
discuss
the
activities
of
other
persons
because
he
does
not
want
to
be
what
he
calls
an
informer.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
would
think
so
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
would
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
suppose
that
our
argument
that
was
broad
--
maybe
broader
than
this.
if
self-esteem
we're
talking
about
and
self-respect,
i
suppose
that
if
you
see
a
friend
of
yours
commit
murder
and
they
asked
you
to
testify
at
the
trial
you
say,
“i
don't
pitcher
my
friends.
i
don't
like
being
an
informer.”
well,
a
lot
of
us
would
think
that
there's
something
hits
this
wrong
about
having
to
testify
about
our
friends
and
sending
under
them
into
perhaps
to
his
death
but
that
isn't
--
never
been
a
legal
right.
thank
you
your
honor.
