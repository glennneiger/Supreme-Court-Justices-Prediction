i
think
--
are
you
now
arguing
within
the
corners
of
the
barenblatt
opinion
or
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
that?
justice
potter
stewart
aren't
you
--
are
you
also
making
an
argument
that
within
the
framework,
within
the
context
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
that
opinion
that
applying
the
--
your
concept
of
the
balancing
test,
that
the
balance
here
should
be
struck
to
favor
the
petition?
justice
potter
stewart
also
in
--
in
that
sense,
you're
not
asking
us
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
--
do
you
construe
these
questions
as
requesting
the
names
of
people?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly.
justice
potter
stewart
how
else
can
you
look
at
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
was
it
wasn't
who
recruited
him
but
just
whether
the
person
who
have
had
recruited
him
was
a
communications
person?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
this
is
perhaps
a
collateral
issue
but
i
had
in
some
witness
in
california
identified
--
was
that
--
that
was
the
wilkinson's
case.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
they're
having
at
the
committee
a
witness
in
california
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
had
identified
at
wilkinson
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
you
say
that
you've
got
a
probable
cause
rule
or
some
kind
or
simply
some
question
about
raising
it
in
some
--
based
in
the
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice

--
of
the
new
york
times?
justice
potter
stewart
or
one
of
the
other
is
one
collaboration
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
an
officer
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
member,
long
time
member.
justice
potter
stewart
this
--
and
i
don't
want
to
delay
you
for
this
question
as
to
what
indictments
--
indictment
must
contain,
you
say
it's
not
in
this
case.
it's
the
same
indictment
as
in
the
last
case
has
tried
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
there
is
in
the
record
of
motion
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
certainly
for
the
trial
court
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
in
the
record
a
motion
striking
it
unless
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
quash
it.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
actually
contrasting
with
the
yellin
case
which
we
have
per
se
of
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
the
principle
would
apply
in
a
civil
trial,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
all
employer's
--
liability
act
case
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
the
plaintiff
had
been
in
a
communist
meeting
or
something,
that
became
relevant
to
the
