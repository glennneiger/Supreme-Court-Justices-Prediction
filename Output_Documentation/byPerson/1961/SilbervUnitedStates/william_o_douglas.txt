well,
assume
--
well,
assume
that
it
wasn't
the
next
question
though
and
you
really
would
make
a
different
argument,
would
you,
meaning
if
the
name
thing
was
really
out
of
it
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
(voice

--
the
same
argument.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh
i
understand
that
so
you
would
make
--
but
you
would
make
the
same
kind
of
an
argument.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
assume
we
said
--
assume
that
the
question
was
like
one
of
the
other
questions
was,
were
there
any
other
communists
in
your
establishment
(voice

justice
william
o.
douglas
how
many

there
of
your

communists?
how
many
of
them?

and
apply
it
to
that

justice
william
o.
douglas
okay.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
now,
wait
a
minute.
the
testimony
sought
is
relevant
(inaudible)
i
believe
that
you
put
it
to
forge
the
documents
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
irrelevant
to
the
inquiry.
and
that
we
need
it
for
a
substitution
for
this
person
what
he
knows
is
definitely
relevant
to
the
inquiry.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
you
should
--
you
should
have
some
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
he
knows
something
relevant
to
the
inquiry
that
you
can
see
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh
yes,
but
the
document
sought
--
they
believe
that
the
reasonable
cause
with
the
documents,
the
contents
of
the
document
relevant
to
the
inquiry.
justice
william
o.
douglas

if
you
don't
produce
it
in
the
response
to
the
subpoena.

william
o.
douglas

you
think
this
whole
issue
is
eliminated
by
the
fact
this
gentleman
sort
of
a
trial
or
sort
of
the
hearing
then
everyone's
a
communist?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
the
issue
is
different
here.
the
question
is
whether

justice
william
o.

all
you
would
do
then
--
all
you
would
then
is

to
your
idea
