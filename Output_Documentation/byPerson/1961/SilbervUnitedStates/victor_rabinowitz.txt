mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
silber
is
another
one
of
those
cases
that
came
between
the
decisions
in
wilkinson
and
barenblatt.
he
was
called
in
the
same
inquiry,
same
investigation
as
mr.
grumman
in
the
immediate
preceding
case.
he
was
represented
by
me
at
the
congressional
committee
hearing
and
at
his
trial.
he
was
tried
a
week
or
two
after
the
allen
case,
although
his
testimony
before
the
committee
was
some
months
before
allen's
testimony.
he
was
convicted
for
violation
of
section
192
on
three
counts
for
refusal
to
answer
three
questions
and
received
a
sentence
of
four
months.
the
subject
under
inquiry
as
announced
by
the
committee
was
communist
penetration
into
the
communications
industry.
it
has
been
discussed
by
previous
counsel
on
the
previous
case
and
i
might
add
that
this
was
the
fourth
hearing
held
by
congressional
committees
on
this
very
same
subject.
the
petitioner
appeared
subject
to
the
subpoena.
he
said
that
he
had
been
employed
by
western
union
for
41
years.
he
said
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
that
he
had
joined
the
communist
party
in
1948,
that
he
had
--
that
hearing
was
in
1957,
that
he
had
been
a
member
for
about
a
year,
that
he
had
attended
meetings
he
said
rarely
during
that
period
of
time
and
then
he
dropped
out
because
he
found
that
he
wasn't
much
interested
and
that
he
was
interested
in
other
things.
now,
one
would
have
thought
that
if
this
committee
was
interested
in
sabotage,
espionage,
communist
control
of
the
communications
industry,
this
man
would
have
been
affined.
he
was
a
man
who
admitted
having
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
for
a
period
of
a
year
in
the
communications
industry,
employed
by
western
union
presumably
in
a
position
to
give
the
very
kind
of
information
that
the
committee
was
interested
at.
no
questions
with
relation
to
espionage,
sabotage,
communist
control
were
asked.
instead,
the
committee
following
its
incessant
and
unremitting
quest
for
names
moved
immediately
into
that
area.
the
first
question
which
is
the
subject
of
the
indictment
here
count
1
was,
“was
the
person
who
recruited
you
a
communications'
worker?"
and
mr.
silber
had
answered
the
questions
up
to
that
time
but
at
least
he
bought
and
he
said
he
must
decline
to
answer
this
question.
i
might
say
that
mr.
silber
was
an
elderly
gentleman,
now
on
pension,
not
very
articulate.
and
when
he
said
i
must
decline,
the
committee
counsel
asked
him
why.
and
he
said
on
the
basis
of
the
watkins
and
sweezy
decisions
and
also
that
mr.
grumman
who
had
testified
two
weeks
before
had
filed
a
long
statement
with
the
committee
and
he
said,
“i
want
to
rely
on
all
of
the
grounds
that
was
stated
by
mr.
grumman
in
his
testimony
which
include
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
committee,
rights
under
the
first
amendment
of
vagueness
of
the
resolution
setting
up
the
committee,
the
lack
of
a
pertinency
of
the
question.”
all
of
those
grounds
which
had
been
suggested
by
the
watkins
decision
which
is
i
say,
had
come
down
six
weeks
before.
and
counsel
at
this
point
said
to
him,
counsel
for
the
committee
said
to
him,
asked
leave
to
--
“explain
to
the
witness
why
this
question
was
pertinent.”
and
he
said,
“this
committee
is
considering
legislation
to
safeguard
this
nation
from
possible
espionage
or
sabotage
facilities
by
congress.”
if
the
person
who
enlisted
you
which
of
the
communist
party
was
engaged
in
the
communications
field,
that
person
undoubtedly
would
have
some
information
which
will
be
of
used
to
this
committee
in
developing
facts
and
respecting
communist
penetration
of
the
communications
facilities
of
this
country.
and
the
witness
was
directed
to
answer
the
question
again
and
i
mean
--
and
witness
said,
“i'm
very
sorry.
my
conscience
prohibits
me
from
answering
this.”
and
on
three
or
four
other
occasions
during
the
course
of
the
hearing
when
other
questions
of
a
similar
nature
were
asked,
he
repeated
the
grounds
that
had
previously
been
given
summarizing
in
a
layman's
fashion
when
he
conceived
to
be
the
hauling
for
the
watkins
case,
conceived
i
regret
to
say
incorrectly.
he
said,
“i'm
sorry
but
i
have
a
conscience.”
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
said
the
same
thing
at
sentence
that
his
conscience
prohibited
from
--
him
from
naming
other
person.
count
2
was
stricken.
count
3
was,
“were
there
any
officers
of
your
union,
members
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
you
were
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
and
3,
“were
any
of
the
present
officers
of
your
union,
members
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
you
were
in
the
party?”
although,
there
was
an
explanation
of
pertinency
with
respect
to
count
1,
there
was
no
explanation
of
pertinency
with
respect
to
counts
2
and
4
except
that
after
he
had
answered
the
question
and
had
--
after
he'd
refused
to
answer
the
question
and
had
been
directed
to
do
so
by
the
committee
and
he
had
refused
to
do
so,
mr.
shera,
a
member
of
the
committee
said,
“and
these
questions
were
asked
you
for
the
same
reason
that
mr.
arens,
our
counsel
gave
you
for
asking
the
other
questions.
they
are
pertinent
for
the
same
reasons
that
he
advanced,
namely
that
it
would
give
the
committee
an
opportunity
to
cost
deal
other
people.
now,
this
is
an
illustration
i
think
of
the
committee's
never
ending
quest
for
names.
the
witness
was
not
asked
about
his
activities
in
the
communist
party.
he
was
not
asked
about
espionage
or
sabotage
or
any
of
the
other
subjects
the
committee
is
allegedly
interested
in.
all
he
was
asked
for
was
the
names
of
other
persons
and
although
he
expressed
a
perfect
willingness
and
said,
“i
am
perfectly
willing
to
tell
you
everything
about
myself.
my
conscience
does
not
permit
me
to
give
the
names
of
other
persons.”
the
name
of
other
persons
was
the
only
subject
that
the
committee
was
interested
in.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
suppose
not
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
think
there
are
many
reasons
in
the
first
place
and
one
of
the
considerations
is
that
a
grand
jury
investigation
is
by
law
subject
to
secrecy.
what
a
witness
says
at
a
grand
jury
investigation
is
not
a
matter
of
public
knowledge.
i
think
further
that
well
i
--
perhaps
i
was
wrong
in
saying
that
the
question
would
not
have
been
--
the
objection
would
not
necessarily
have
been
relevant
--
have
been
improper
--
the
objection
were
not
necessarily
have
been
proper
before
a
grand
jury.
i
suppose
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
it
were
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
it
were
sufficiently
relevant
to
lawsuit,
perhaps
--
if
it
were
relevant,
perhaps
he
could
not
have
answered
on
these
grounds
or
he
would
be
more
accurate,
have
had
the
opportunity
of
taking
risks
of
not
answering
and
answering.
but
this
was
not
a
lawsuit,
this
was
a
legislative
investigation.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
because
the
purpose
of
a
congressional
committee
had
always
understood
was
to
secure
information
for
legislative
purposes,
and
not
to
engage
in
a
program
of
exposure
for
exposures
sake
if
i
may
quote
language
from
--
i
am
sure
some
decisions
of
this
court
either
majority
or
minority.
this
committee
asked
this
witness
no
questions
about
his
activities
in
the
communist
party.
it
was
apparently
not
interested
in
anything
that
he
did
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
it
said
nothing
to
him
about
espionage,
sabotage,
or
anything
else.
all
that
was
interested
in
was
the
never
ending
quest
for
names
and
names
and
more
names.
and
i
submit
that
the
purpose
of
this
committee
and
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
this
has
been
called,
i
am
sure
for
the
attention
of
this
court
is
not
in
my
opinion,
although
i
regret
to
say
not
the
opinion
of
the
court,
a
true
legislative
purpose
but
as
a
purpose
of
exposure,
a
purpose
of
publishing
as
many
names
and
more
names
and
more
names.
this
matter
has
been
considered
by
the
court.
it
was
considered
by
the
court
in
many
of
these
decisions
and
this
is
a
perfect
illustration.
he
was
a
witness
who
admitted
membership
in
the
communist
party,
was
asked
no
questions
at
all
about
his
activities
in
the
communist
party,
was
asked
no
questions
about
espionage
or
sabotage
or
all
of
those
other
things
that
we
are
told
are
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
here.
all
he
was
asked
for
are
what
are
the
names
of
other
persons?
he
even
indicated
their
willingness
and
said,
“i'm
willing
to
tell
you
anything
about
myself,
my
conscience
does
not
permit
me
to
tell
you
about
other
persons.”
this
it
seems
to
me
is
a
perfect
illustration
of
the
lack
of
true
legislative
purpose
of
this
committee.
now,
i
realize
that
this
court
has
--
majority
of
this
court
at
least,
has
passed
on
this
subject
before
and
i'm
not
going
to
repeat
the
argument
that
i
made
in
the
yellin
case
because
among
other
reasons,
i
don't
have
the
time
for
it
and
i
don't
want
to
go
through
the
same
the
thing
twice.
but
here
is
a
perfect
illustration
as
i
say
of
the
committee's
never
ending
quest
for
names
and
names
and
names
and
more
names.
and
when
it
does
get
a
witness
who
is
prepared
to
say,
“yes,
i
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
i'll
tell
you
everything
i
want
to
know
about
myself
but
i
cannot
in
good
conscience
answer
about
others,”
they
don't
ask
him
about
himself
but
they
only
ask
about
others.
at
the
close
of
the
hearing,
mr.
doyle
who
was
chairing
a
meeting
complemented
the
petitioner
on
his
frankness
in
admitting
his
membership
in
the
communist
party.
he
complemented
him
on
his
good
sense
and
getting
out
of
the
communist
party
when
he
did
and
he
invited
him
to
help
the
committee
and
the
witness
said,
“i'm
sorry,
i
have
a
conscience
to
protect.”
the
case
was
tried
a
few
weeks
after
the
yellin
case
and
it
likewise
resulted
in
the
conviction
this
time
in
the
sentence
of
only
four
months,
the
yellin
conviction
had
been
for
a
year.
the
petitioner
urges
several
grounds
for
reversal
here,
and
i
am
not
going
to
--
oh
incidentally,
let
me
add
one
more
thing.
at
the
close
of
the
case,
i
offered
the
same
testimony
that
professor
emerson
had
given
in
the
yellin
case
as
an
offer
of
proof
in
this
case
for
the
purpose
of
proving
that
the
--
well,
the
same
purposes
i
had
--
as
i
had
in
the
yellin
case
namely,
issue
that
went
to
the
question
of
just
a
cause
for
a
congressional
investigation
and
a
balance
of
--
a
balance
of
--
and
the
matter
of
whether
there
was
balance
of
the
interest
involved
in
the
situation.
the
court
refused
to
accept
the
offer
of
proof,
however,
it
is
--
it
is
printed
in
the
record
as
it
is
in
the
yellin
record
that
was
submitted
in
writing
and
the
same
issues
are
raised
here
as
were
raised
in
the
yellin
--
in
the
yellin
case.
i'm
not
going
to
reargue
those.
we
do
contend,
however,
as
we
did
in
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
probable
cause
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh
yes,
of
course
sir.
that
relates
really
to
the
question
that
was
discussed
to
some
extent
in
the
previous
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i'll
get
to
that
very
shortly.
my
first
argument
is
that
the
questions
here
were
not
pertinent.
this
man
had
been
out
of
the
communist
party
for
nine
years
at
the
time
he
was
testifying.
he
could
offer
no
testimony
as
to
the
relevance
of
any
matter
that
had
been
before
congress
at
the
time
that
he
was
testifying.
he
had
no
contact
with
the
communist
party
for
eight
or
nine
years.
the
only
questions
he
was
asked
were
questions
which
related
to
the
membership
of
other
persons.
the
committee
showed
a
complete
disinterest
in
his
own
activities
in
the
communist
party
and
asked
him
no
questions
concerning
him.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
because
of
the
remoteness
of
his
membership
and
because
mere
listing
of
names
cannot
be
pertinent,
it's
a
sort
of
a
discovery
proceeding
and
not
a
legislative
investigation
that
the
questions
were
not
pertinent
to
the
subject
matter
under
inquiry.
on
the
question
that
judge
brennan
asked
namely
the
probable
cause
for
the
issuing
of
a
subpoena
to
the
witness.
now
in
the
barenblatt
case,
you
will
recall
that
the
court
said,
and
this
was
referred
to
in
the
previous
case,
nor
did
petitioner's
appearance
as
a
witness
followed
from
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures
lacking
in
probable
cause
for
belief
that
he
possessed
information
which
might
be
--
might
be
helpful
to
the
subcommittee.
now,
it
is
my
contention
that
the
words
probable
cause
have
a
meaning.
they
have
a
meaning
in
our
law
and
it's
a
meaning
which
is
found
in
many
fourth
amendment
cases
and
the
meaning
which
is
found
in
our
criminal
law
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that's
true.
i
can
attend
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
contend
that
it
does.
i
can
send
--
contend
that
the
court
used
the
words
probable
cause.
it
didn't
use
other
words.
these
are
words
of
art
and
they
have
a
meaning.
now,
let
us
see
what
the
"probable
cause"
was
in
this
case.
they
did
not
ask
--
mr.
justice
stewart
had
suggested
a
little
while
ago,
pick
up
every
tenth
--
tenth
men
off
the
street,
that
is
true.
but
we
inquired
at
the
trial
at
some
length
as
to
why
mr.
silber
was
called
and
we
found
that
the
following
were
the
reasons
that
were
given
for
calling
him.
in
the
first
place,
he
had
access
to
the
messages
and
facilities
of
western
union
which
would
present
sabotage
and
espionage
possibilities.
his
position
would
be
considered
important.
he
signed
communist
party
petitions
on
behalf
of
israel
amter
and
benjamin
davis.
now,
there's
no
indication
in
the
record
as
to
when
he
signed
those
petitions
for
benjamin
davis
and
israel
amter.
amter
had
a
last
run
for
political
office
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
in
the
year
1939,
so
that
was
the
last
time
he
could
have
signed
the
petition
for
israel
amter,
1939
would
have
been
20
years
prior
to
his
testimony.
davis
had
run
for
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
on
a
communist
party
ticket
and
had
run
for
other
offices
on
the
communist
party
ticket
in
new
york.
but
the
last
time,
he
ran
was
1946,
so
that
was
12
years
prior
to
the
date
that
he
ran
for
office.
the
next
reason
was
that
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
mr.
davis
ran,
not
the
witness.
the
witness
had
signed
anonymity.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
indeed.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
both
amter
and
davis
ran
for
office
and
davis
was
for
a
number
of
years,
a
member
of
the
city
council
of
new
york
on
the
communist
party
ticket.
the
next
reason
was
that
in
1940,
the
new
york
times
had
listed
his
name
as
the
name
of
a
person
whom
someone
had
called
a
red
in
the
course
of
inter
--
a
factional
dispute
in
the
american
labor
party
that
was
the
other
--
another
reason
for
calling
this
witness.
and
finally,
his
son
whose
first
name
is
unknown,
was
also
identified
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
by
a
confidential
source.
this,
i
suppose
is
the
reverse
of
the
sins
of
the
father
being
visited
on
the
son.
we
contended
and
still
contend
that
this
was
not
within
the
meaning
of
the
barenblatt
decision,
probable
cause
for
calling
this
witness.
the
words
“probable
cause”
have
a
meaning
in
the
law,
and
i
cannot
believe
that
the
court
used
the
words
probable
cause
merely
to
mean
that
there
was
some
sort
of
a
reason.
it
seems
to
me
on
the
contrary
that
this
was
precisely
and
indiscriminate
dragnet
proceeding.
thousands
of
people
had
signed
communist
party
nominating
petitions
on
behalf
of
amter
and
davis.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
i
am
arguing
that
this
was
the
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedure.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
right.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
exactly.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
let
me
make
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
almost
every
other
case
that
has
come
before
the
court.
i
think
that
whitman
maybe
an
exception.
there
is
an
exception
of
one
of
the
cases
that
was
argued
this
year.
in
almost
every
other
case
that
has
come
before
the
court,
there
has
been
from
somebody,
sworn
testimony
that
the
man
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
this
was
true
in
braden.
you
may
not
have
thought
much
of
the
testimony
but
there
was
by
somebody,
sworn
testimony
that
he'd
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
there
had
been
sworn
testimony
by
--
in
wilkinson,
there
had
been
sworn
testimony
as
to
barenblatt.
there
had
been
sworn
testimony
as
to
yellin.
there
had
been
sworn
testimony
as
to
grumman.
there
had
been
sworn
testimony
as
to
almost
all
of
these
persons.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
may
have
been
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
may
have
been
the
case.
i
don't
remember
which
one
of
the
ones
who
were
heard
earlier
this
term
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
a,
"indiscriminate
dragnet
procedure."
now
so
far
as
the
signing
of
the
petition
for
davis
and
amter
were
concerned,
under
the
new
york
state
law,
a
nominating
petition
for
davis
would
have
required
12,000
signatures.
that
means
that
if
the
government
is
right,
anyone
of
those
12,000
persons
could
have
been
called
before
the
committee
and
questioned
or
can
be
called
before
the
committee
and
questioned
as
to
whether
he
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
if
this
is
not
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedure,
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand
what
those
words
could
have
meant.
i
will
not
repeat
here
the
constitutional
issues
that
i
argued
a
little
earlier
in
the
--
in
the
yellin
case,
i
think
all
of
those
constitutional
issues
are
equally
relevant
in
this
case
and
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
issues,
i
am
asking
you
to
overrule
the
barenblatt
and
wilkinson
and
braden
decision.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
i
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
in
that
sense,
i
am
asking
you
follow
what
i
conceived
to
be
the
ruling
in
the
barenblatt
and
wilkinson
and
braden
cases.
the
testimony
of
professor
emerson
which
was
incorporated
in
the
yellin
case
in
which
i've
discussed
this
morning
was
relevant
in
this
case
as
well.
and
was
as
i
say,
admitted
in
the
--
or
it's
in
the
record
in
this
case.
furthermore,
what
was
the
testimony
which
petitioner
was
being
called
on
to
give?
there
had
been
four
or
five
investigations
over
a
period
of
years
into
so
called
communist
activity
in
the
communications
industry.
there
had
been
several
hundred
pages
of
testimony
taken
over
this
subject
and
the
naming
of
over
a
hundred
persons
in
the
industry
who
were
alleged
to
have
been
communists.
many
names
were
repeated
over
and
over
and
over
again.
the
petitioner's
membership
in
the
communist
party
had
been
nine
years
before.
it
had
been
casual
in
significance
and
remote
in
time.
suppose
he's
been
able
to
name
two
or
three
more
people,
suppose
he
had
been
able
to
say
that
instead
of
there
having
been
a
hundred
persons
in
the
communications
industry
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party,
there
had
been
106
who
had
been
members
of
the
communist
party
of
what
legislative
significance
would
this
conceivably
have
had
to
the
congressional
committee
which
has
been
investigating
this
union
now
for
a
period
of
i
think
11
years.
we
have,
on
the
other
hand
i
think,
very
substantial
rights
of
the
petitioner
and
i've
discussed
this
in
the
petitioner
and
also
very
substantial
rights
on
the
part
of
the
public
to
--
well
as
i
said
in
the
yellin
case
this
morning,
substantial
rights
on
the
part
of
the
public
to
hear
issues
discussed
and
to
engage
in
this
public
debate
which
is
a
debate
that
is
proceeding
throughout
the
world.
the
petitioner
here
was
in
effect
being
asked
to
be
an
informant.
he
was
not
being
asked
--
he
was
asked
as
to
any
of
his
own
activities
and
in
our
opinion,
the
remoteness
of
the
testimony
being
at
best
nine
years
old,
the
lack
of
probable
cause
here
within
the
barenblatt
decision
and
the
balancing
problem
which
i
have
referred
to
a
few
moments
ago
all
add
up
to
the
same
thing.
there
had
been
three
prior
hearings
held
by
congressional
committees
on
the
problem
of
so
called
communism
in
the
communications
industry.
hundreds
of
names
had
been
recited,
dozens
of
witnesses
have
been
testified,
this
thing
has
been
going
on
for
11
years,
congress
still
hasn't
passed
any
legislation
on
the
subject
and
there
must
be
a
time
when
congress
--
it
seems
to
me
and
this
committee
must
be
told
that
enough
is
enough.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
so
the
counsel
at
the
--
the
pertinency
that
was
explained
to
him
at
the
hearing
was
that
he
--
the
pertinency
that
was
explained
by
counsel
was,
“we
want
to
know
so
that
we
can
call
these
people
and
they
may
be
able
to
give
us
information.”
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
will
concede
that
these
questions
do
not,
on
their
face,
call
for
names.
it's
quite
correct.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
you
can
look
at
the
question
by
examining
the
reason
for
pertinency
given
by
the
--
by
counsel
at
the
time
that
the
question
was
asked
and
the
government
is
bound
by
its
explanation
of
pertinency.
the
reason
given
by
counsel
was
if
the
person
who
enlists
--
the
first
question
was
who
recruited
you?
if
the
person
who
enlisted
you
into
the
communist
party
was
engaged
in
the
communications
field,
that
person
undoubtedly
would
have
some
information
which
would
be
of
used
of
this
committee
in
developing
facts,
respecting
communist
penetration
of
the
communication's
facilities
of
this
country.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
but
the
explanation
of
pertinency
was
that
this
would
supply
the
committee
with
the
names
of
persons.
i
assumed
that
the
next
question
was
--
would
have
been
who
and
the
witness
must
have
assumed
that
too.
otherwise,
there
is
no
sense
to
counsel's
explanation
of
pertinency.
and
i
submit
that
as
i
have
been
pointed
before,
the
committee
is
bound
by
its
own
explanation
of
pertinency
and
i
read
again,
and
this
appears
at
page
28
of
the
record.
if
the
person
who
enlisted
you
in
the
communist
party
was
engaged
in
the
communications
field,
that
person
undoubtedly
would
have
some
information
which
would
be
of
used
to
this
committee
in
developing
facts,
respecting
communist
penetration
of
the
communications
facility
of
this
country.
now,
it's
true
that
the
government
now
claims
that
in
addition
to
the
naming
of
names,
in
addition
to
asking
him
to
be
an
informant
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
they
didn't
yet.
i
will
concede
that
they
didn't
yet
but
i
also
submit
that
counsel
in
explaining
pertinency
had
pointed
out
that
that
was
going
to
be
the
next
question.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
the
person
who
enlisted
you
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
the
person
who
enlisted
you
into
to
the
communist
party
was
engaged
in
the
communications
field.
well
i'm
sorry,
the
question
was,
was
the
person
who
recruited
you
a
communications
worker?
if
there
had
been
another
explanation
of
pertinency,
i
don't
know
what
the
other
explanation
of
pertinency
--
pertinency
might
have
been.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
is
quite
possible
if
the
witness
would
have
answered.
the
witness
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
his
conscience
prohibited
him
from
naming
names.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
question
could
have
been
answered
yes
or
no
without
naming
names.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
suspect
that
if
that
had
been
the
explanation
of
pertinency
--
touch
me
to
go
back
now
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
can't
say
what
would
have
happened
if
that
had
happened.
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
mr.
arens,
who
was
conducting
this
--
this
examination
had
said,
“i'm
not
asking
you
for
the
names.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
he
was
a
communications
worker.”
i,
who
was
his
counsel
at
the
time,
might
very
well
have
advised
him
to
answer
the
question
but
that
isn't
what
mr.
arens
said
when
he
explained
pertinency.
what
mr.
arens
said
was,
“if
the
person
who
enlisted
you
in
the
communist
party
was
engaged
in
the
communications
field,
we
could
call
him
too”
and
this
would
be
possible
only
if
he
were
--
if
their
names
were
to
be
given.
apparently,
silber
so
understood
the
question
because
he
said,
“i
can't
do
this
because
it's
against
my
conscience”
and
at
the
close
of
the
testimony
likewise,
he
said,
“i
cannot
name
the
names
of
other
people
because
it's
against
my
conscience.”
it's
true
that
now
the
government
says,
possibly
there
would
have
been
other
relevance.
it
doesn't
say
what
that
other
relevance
would
have
been.
but
at
the
hearing,
the
relevance
urged
was
that,
“if
you
answer
this
question,
we
can
call
that
person
because
he
maybe
able
to
give
you
the
names
of
--
he
may
be
able
to
give
you
information”
and
i
quote
“which
would
be
of
used
to
the
committee
in
developing
facts
to
respecting
communist
penetration
of
communications
facilities
of
the
country.”
now
since
mr.
arens
wanted
these
people,
wanted
this
question
answered
so
that
he
could
call
witnesses,
it
must
have
been
for
the
--
it
must've
one
of
their
names.
otherwise,
the
explanation
of
relevancy
is
totally
meaningless.
