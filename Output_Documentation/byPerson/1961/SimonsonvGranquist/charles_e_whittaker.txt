justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
excuse
me
please,
i
did
not
understand
--
did
you
say
that
the
tax
lien
had
been
filed
in
the
harris
case
in
advance
of
the
bankruptcy?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
medalie
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
medalie,
may
i
ask
you
in
that
connection
if
at
that
stage
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
the
trustee
had
paid
the
principle
sum
of
the
debt,
leaving
only
the
penalty,
would
not
that
have
ended
the
secured
claim?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
i
may
be
wrong
about
this.
this
has
been
my
understanding
that
the
lien
is
only
a
security
for
the
debt.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
yes
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
in
bankruptcy
to
be
allowable
the
debt
must
be
provable,
isn't
that
so?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
(inaudible)
--
under
57j
is
that
a
prohibition
against
the
provability
of
penalties?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
of
course
that's
what
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
mean
not
provable?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
let
me
speak
of
provable
debts
and
bankruptcies,
we
speak
of
those
that
maybe
allowed,
do
we
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
would
be
so
and
it
would
not
(inaudible)
this
debt
in
the
bankruptcy
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
now
before
he
can
get
possession
of
the
property
to
file
a
petition
for
reclamation
in
the
bankruptcy
court
and
get
possession
of
it
before
he
can
sell
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
trustee.
