mr.
donald
a.
schmechel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
concerned
here
in
these
two
cases
which
are
consolidated
in
a
single
petition
before
the
court
with
two
aspects
of
the
bankruptcy
law
which
relate
also
to
the
laws
of
taxation.
in
the
two
cases,
both
the
harris
case
which
is
a
chapter
10
pre-organization
under
the
bankruptcy
statute,
and
the
simonson
case
which
is
an
ordinary
bankruptcy
proceeding,
in
both
of
these
cases,
there
is
presently
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
a
tax
penalty
which
is
a
subject
of
a
lien,
whether
the
lien
be
recorded,
whether
the
notice
of
lien
be
recorded
prior
to
bankruptcy
or
not
recorded,
is
a
valid
tax
lien
with
respect
to
the
penalty
so
that
it
can
be
recovered
despite
the
language
in
57j
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
this
part
--
this
issue
which
involves
and
could
determine
both
the
simonson
and
the
harris
case,
will
be
argued
by
me.
there
is
a
second
issue
which
is
present
only
in
the
simonson
case,
an
ordinary
bankruptcy
case,
primarily
arising
under
section
70c
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
section
6323
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
basically
it
is
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
is
a
judgment
creditor
or
entitled
to
exercise
some
of
the
rights
of
a
judgment
creditor
as
against
an
unrecorded
tax
lien.
in
the
simonson
case
the
notice
of
a
tax
lien
had
not
been
recorded
prior
to
the
inception
of
the
bankruptcy.
this
second
issue
which
is
present
only
in
the
simonson
case,
would
be
argued
by
my
colleague
and
who
is
the
counsel
in
that
case.
now
briefly
the
facts
of
these
two
cases
should
be
observed
because
they
do
have
some
light
upon
both
the
general
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
statute
and
the
effect
which
should
be
given
to
them.
the
simonson
case
as
indicated
is
an
ordinary
bankruptcy
wherein
upon
liquidation
of
the
assets,
the
trustee
realized
some
$8000
which
was
sufficient
to
pay
all
tax
claims
and
expenses
of
the
administration
and
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
as
indicated,
the
government
had
a
tax
lien
represented
by
its
assessment
procedures
but
no
notice
of
the
tax
lien
was
on
file.
the
united
states
filed
its
claim
in
the
simonson
case
as
a
secured
creditor,
relying
on
the
lien,
both
as
to
the
principle,
post
petition
interest
and
as
to
penalties.
the
trustee
paid
both
the
entire
principle
of
the
taxes
involved
and
all
pre-petition
interest.
the
trustee
and
the
court
below
disallowed
post
petition
interest
and
some
$1442
in
penalties
and
it
is
this
amount
which
is
involved
in
the
simonson
case.
the
harris
case
somewhat
by
contrast
is
a
proceeding
under
chapter
10
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
a
corporate
reorganization
of
a
small
operating
telephone
company.
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
--
initially
a
chapter
11
proceeding
which
was
soon
converted
into
the
chapter
10
proceeding,
various
tax
liens
against
the
bankrupt
--
or
insolvent
telephone
company
had
been
filed,
notices
of
the
tax
lien
were
on
file
unlike
in
the
simonson
case.
also
prior
to
the
inception
of
the
proceeding
as
appears
in
the
record,
the
taxpayer
had
made
an
offer
in
compromise
to
the
government
as
against
to
all
these
taxes
in
the
sum
of
some
$57,000
of
which
$40,000
was
actually
being
held
pursuant
to
that
offer
in
compromise
at
the
time
that
the
chapter
10
proceeding
was
instituted.
mr.
donald
a.
schmechel
that
is
correct
your
honor
in
the
harris
case
some
year
or
two
before
the
inception
of
the
reorganization,
the
notices
of
the
tax
lien
were
recorded
and
filed.
mr.
donald
a.
schmechel
now
in
the
harris
case,
the
government
came
in,
as
shown
in
the
record,
and
again
filed
a
claim
as
the
secured
creditor,
claiming
not
only
the
principle
of
their
taxes
slightly
less
than
$57,000
but
claiming
also
pre-petition
interest,
post
petition
interest,
and
penalties
with
no
mention
being
made
with
the
$40,000
then
being
held
by
the
government.
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
as
the
record
shows,
the
court
finally
ordered
the
government
to
return
the
$40,000
to
the
trustee,
and
subsequently
in
the
course
of
the
chapter
10
proceedings
a
plan
of
reorganization
was
submitted
in
the
manner
contemplated
by
the
statute.
the
plan
of
reorganization
provided
as
part
of
its
very
equitable
and
just
provisions
that
a
payment
of
$57,000
representing
all
of
the
principle
of
the
taxes
to
united
states
should
be
paid
in
cash
to
the
united
states.
the
united
state
acting
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
under
section
199
of
chapter
10
declined
that
to
acquiesce
in
the
acceptance
of
that
amount
which
would
have
been
payment
in
full
of
the
principle
of
the
taxes,
the
court
then
proceeded
as
permitted
on
chapter
10
to
confirm
and
approve
the
plan
and
make
separate
provision
in
effect
with
respect
to
any
claims
of
about
which
there
was
a
dispute
including
this
particular
one
with
reference
to
the
penalties
and
post
petition
interest.
as
a
result
of
this,
the
trustee
filed
objections
to
the
claim
of
the
united
states
for
penalties
and
to
the
claim
of
the
unites
states
for
post
petition
interest
and
the
referee
in
the
district
court
both
granted
the
contention
of
the
trustee,
disallowing
any
penalties
and
disallowing
any
post
petition
interest.
the
united
states
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
only
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
penalties,
not
seeking
any
review
of
the
issue
on
post
petition
interest.
now
as
a
result
of
the
action
taken
in
the
proceedings,
of
course
and
the
order
of
the
court
below,
the
district
court
directing
payment
of
the
full
principle
the
taxes
of
$57,000,
they
have
been
paid
so
that
in
both
the
simonson
and
then
the
harris
case,
all
principle
of
the
taxes
have
been
paid
and
any
pre
petition
interest
that
was
involved
has
been
paid
or
would
be
paid
as
provided.
the
only
issue
before
the
court
is
then
with
respect
to
the
--
whether
or
not
the
penalties
can
be
recovered
in
both
of
those
instances.
now
as
to
both
of
these
issues
the
issue
on
penalties
present
in
both
cases
and
the
issue
with
respect
to
the
status
of
the
trustee
as
a
judgment
creditor,
neither
of
these
issues
have
been
directly
before
this
court
before
as
far
as
counsel
can
discover.
now
turning
first
to
the
argument
on
the
question
of
penalties
which
applies
as
indicated
to
both
cases,
in
our
--
it
is
our
contention
that
a
straight,
simple
statutory
interpretation
of
section
57j
and
67b
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
possible,
and
that
it
gives
a
reasonable
effect
to
both
of
those
sections
and
prohibits
the
recovery
of
a
tax
penalty
as
part
of
a
lien
in
both
the
simonson
case
and
in
the
harris
case.
57j
is
a
fairly
short
provision
and
is
set
forth
in
petitioner's
brief
and
in
the
government's
brief.
it
provides
briefly
as
follows
that
debts
owing
to
the
united
states
or
any
state
or
any
subdivision
as
a
penalty
or
forfeiture
shall
not
be
allowed
except
for
the
amount
of
pecuniary
loss
sustained
by
the
act,
transaction
or
proceeding
are
to
which
the
penalty
or
forfeiture
arose
with
reasonable
and
actual
costs
occasioned
thereby
and
such
interests
may
have
accrued
in
the
amount
of
such
loss
according
to
law.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
there
has
never
been
any
contention
in
either
of
the
simonson
case
or
the
harris
case
by
the
government
that
any
--
particular
loss
has
been
occasioned
by
reason
of
which
latter
part
of
this
section
would
have
any
applicability.
it
is
the
contention
in
effect
to
the
united
states
and
once
a
tax
lien
arises,
whether
or
not
the
notice
of
a
tax
lien
is
on
file
that
the
associated
tax
penalties
merge
with
and
in
effect
become
a
part
of
the
tax,
that
consequently
under
section
67b
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
such
a
lien
is
preserved
not
only
with
respect
to
the
principle
of
a
tax
but
with
respect
to
the
penalties,
and
despite
the
express
language
which
i
have
cited
to
the
court
in
section
57j.
now
tax
penalties
of
course
do
not
compensate
for
a
loss
sustained
by
the
united
states
and
of
course
none
is
claimed
here
under
this
special
provision
of
the
statute
as
indicated
and
it
is
once
apparent
the
penalties
are
not
allowable
of
course
in
the
case
of
ordinary
tax
claims.
it
has
long
been
decided
since
1924
in
new
york
versus
jersawit
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
that
where
there
is
not
a
lien
--
where
there
is
not
a
lien
supporting
the
tax
that
no
penalty
can
be
recovered
in
the
face
of
section
57j.
the
government
harbor
--
asserts
that
in
the
case
of
a
lien
tax
where
there
is
an
adequate
lien
prior
to
bankruptcy,
that
section
67b
in
effect
bars
the
bankruptcy
court
from
it
--
from
examining
this
otherwise
invalid
component
of
a
tax
claim.
section
67b
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
directed
to
the
preservation
of
statutory
liens
including
tax
liens
as
against
other
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act
applicable
to
other
categories
of
liens
and
reads
in
part
briefly
as
follows.
the
provisions
of
section
60
of
this
act
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
statutory
liens
or
taxes
and
debts
owing
to
the
united
states
or
to
any
state
maybe
valid
against
the
trustee
even
though
arising
or
perfected
while
debtor
is
insolvent
and
within
four
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy.
section
60
referred
to
as
the
court
may
recall,
deals
with
preferences
and
also
with
various
requirements
as
to
recording
in
another
that
certain
other
types
of
liens
may
be
perfected
and
preferences
may
not
be
recovered
and
so
forth.
now,
since
--
even
though
than
a
perfected
lien
may
exist
to
support
a
penalty
of
the
time
of
adjudication
in
bankruptcy,
whether
by
virtue
of
section
67b
or
otherwise,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
bankruptcy
court
is
not
free
to
disregard
the
imperfect
substance
of
the
obligation
upon
which
the
lien
claim
is
based.
mr.
donald
a.
schmechel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
in
the
midst
of
my
summary
argument
with
respect
to
the
penalty
issue
which
is
common
to
both
the
harris
and
the
simonson
cases
and
had
cited
to
the
court
portions
of
the
two
statutes
involved
57j
and
67b,
both
of
which
are
cited
to
be
full
in
the
briefs
of
the
government
and
the
petitioner.
a
comparison
of
these
two
sections
67b
and
57j,
in
our
opinion,
discloses
no
congressionally
intention
that
the
two
should
be
construed
in
conflict.
the
provisions
of
67b
as
i
previously
indicated
are
framed
primarily
to
accept
certain
otherwise
belated
liens
including
tax
liens
from
the
defeating
operation
of
section
60
and
there's
no
apparent
reason
in
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
why
section
67b
need
become
disharmonious
with
the
clear
prohibition
against
the
allowance
of
tax
penalties
which
is
contained
in
section
57j.
even
if
there
were,
it
is
still
a
principal
statutory
construction
as
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
specific
terms
covering
a
given
subject
matter
will
prevail
over
general
language
of
another
statute
which
might
otherwise
prove
controlling.
and
as
also
been
held
that
where
a
statute
general
in
terms
is
a
later
enactment
in
a
special
statute,
the
special
statute
will
control
unless
repealed
by
necessary
implication,
as
indicated
in
the
briefs
both
for
the
government
and
petitioner,
section
57j
the
special
statute
which
is
here
involved
has
existed
substantially
in
its
present
form
since
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1898
while
67b
is
a
creation
of
the
chandler
act
of
1938.
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
indication
to
the
contrary
in
the
language
of
67b
there
is
no
reason
why
this
court
should
find
or
hold
that
these
two
sections
must
be
read
in
conflict.
in
addition
and
for
an
equally
important
reason,
the
bankruptcy
court
of
course
sits
as
a
court
of
equity,
and
it
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
permit
and
duty
to
avoid
any
inequitable
distribution
of
the
bankrupt
estate
which
is
conflict
with
the
clearly
defined
policy
of
the
act
itself.
that
policy
under
section
57j
and
many
other
pertinent
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
aimed
to
preserve
the
bank
of
the
state
from
the
imposition
of
penalties
which
would
tend
to
further
away
its
assets
and
to
bring
about
any
equitable
distribution
of
the
bankrupt
estate
among
creditors
holding
just
demands
based
upon
adequate
consideration.
as
a
court
of
equity,
a
bankruptcy
court
also
has
power
and
obligation
to
look
behind
the
bare
fact
of
a
lien
claim
and
determine
the
provability
or
invalidity
in
bankruptcy
of
the
indebtedness
or
claim
which
is
in
subject
of
the
lien.
thus
in
pepper
versus
litton
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
the
--
this
court
held
that
the
--
that
a
bankruptcy
court
to
which
a
claim
based
on
a
judgment
lien
of
a
state
court
is
presented
for
allowance
has
full
authority
to
determine
the
validity
and
priority
of
the
claim
underlying
the
judgment.
it
would
seem
to
us
beyond
argument
that
a
court
which
is
vested
with
jurisdiction
to
look
behind
a
judgment
of
another
court
to
question
the
probability
or
provability
of
an
underlying
claim
is
equally
empowered
to
determine
the
provability
of
a
debt
secured
as
here
by
an
ex
parte
statutory
lien
for
taxes.
accordingly
we
think
the
claim
for
penalties
in
both
the
simonson
and
the
harris
case
must
file
--
must
fall
with
the
underlying
debt
itself.
the
lien
cannot
in
our
opinion
directly
lift
into
an
area
of
provability
and
indebtedness
by
origin
in
nature
which
is
unprovable
directly.
a
penalty
no
matter
what
it
may
be
called
by
the
government
in
the
various
cases
where
this
issue
has
come
up
still
remains
a
penalty.
to
hold
otherwise
would
inequitably
punish
general
creditors
as
well
as
creditors
who
were
entitled
to
various
priorities
under
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
creditors
who
have
contributed
a
consideration
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
bankrupt
estate
by
enforcing
a
punitive
provision
directed
at
the
bankrupt,
namely
the
punitive
provisions
of
the
penalty
and
in
effect
levying
them
upon
or
collecting
them
from
the
creditors
and
others
who
in
good
faith
have
dealt
with
the
taxpayer.
we
think
that
the
purpose
and
mandate
of
the
bankruptcy
act
generally
is
and
foremost
to
accomplish
a
fair
and
just
apportionment
of
available
assets
among
the
victims
of
the
bankrupt's
insolvency.
the
application
of
60
--
of
57j
under
these
circumstances
is
in
aid
of
that
purpose
and
ought
not
to
be
circumvented
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
direction
in
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
to
the
contrary.
neither
the
bankruptcy
act
itself
nor
the
internal
revenue
laws,
we
suggest,
are
should
be
construed
or
can
be
construed
to
give
any
such
direction
or
light
as
would
require
that
the
penalty
provisions
of
57j
be
disregarded.
now
in
essence
this
the
argument
of
petitioner
with
respect
to
the
penalty
issue
come
to
both
cases
and
as
the
court
will
note
from
my
brief
this
is
basically
the
position
which
the
--
which
was
taken
both
by
the
fourth
and
fifth
circuits
unanimously
on
this
issue
and
was
taken
in
a
very
searching
dissent
by
judge
simons
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
case
which
is
cited
on
page
11
of
our
brief
and
i
would
like
to
read
just
a
portion
of
judge
simons'
descent
in
the
commonwealth
kentucky
case
which
was
cited
with
approval
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
philips
case.
judge
simons
said
that,
and
incidentally
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
case
involved
a
state
penalty
rather
than
a
federal
one,
judge
simons
said
a
lien
is
a
charge
upon
property
for
the
payment
or
discharge
of
a
debt.
it
is
therefore
dependent
upon
the
existence,
the
amount
of,
and
the
provability
of
the
debt.
the
debt
has
been
paid
or
otherwise
expunged
as
per
fraud
or
by
set
off,
the
lien
is
extinguished.
an
in
court
lien
does
not
write
into
security
until
a
debt
comes
into
existence.
in
case
of
private
liens
it
may
be
permissible.
it
may
be
impermissible
to
prove
a
debt
because
of
the
statute
of
frauds
or
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
“i
am
unable”
said
judge
simons
to
see
how
a
lien
however
valid
it
may
be
under
state
law
will
breathe
life
into
an
unprovable
debt
in
the
face
of
section
57j
which
deals
expressly
with
debts
owing
to
any
state
or
subdivision.
the
two
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act
are
not
irreconcilable.
the
tax
lien
is
preserved
to
the
extent
that
it
does
not
include
a
penalty,
and
the
tax
debt
other
than
the
amount
of
a
penalty
is
provable
to
the
extent
the
debt
is
not
provable
in
bankruptcy
the
lien
sees
these
for
all
practical
purposes
to
exist.
judge
simons
then
went
on
to
point
out
the
lack
of
uniformity
which
you
would
have
in
the
--
applicability
the
bankruptcy
act
throughout
the
country
as
different
states
had
varying
provisions
with
respect
to
this
and
if
the
law
or
otherwise
and
as
he
argued
it
should
be.
now
that
is
the
--
is
basically
the
position
with
respect
to
the
penalty
issue.
we
submit
that
the
language
of
57j
and
67b
can
be
read
together
and
when
so
read
together
in
a
manner
indicated,
we
suggest
that
it
comes
out
with
a
result
which
is
eminently
equitable
and
fair
to
all
of
the
parties
in
bankruptcy
proceeding.
i
think
the
court
might
also
take
note
of
the
fact
that
--
and
that
this
is
peculiarity
of
problem
in
all
bankruptcies
as
indicated
in
our
petition
and
brief
in
--
as
the
government
admitted
in
its
answering
memorandum,
some
$2.5
million
approximately
and
some
thousands
of
cases
are
currently
pending
alone
involving
this
penalty
issue.
and
the
suggested
reading
of
the
two
sections
of
the
statute
which
we
find
harmonious
would
not
really
seriously
affect
the
government
because
it
would
leave
them
with
respect
to
their
lien
for
taxes
as
to
entire
principal
of
their
taxes,
it
would
leave
undisturbed
in
a
pre
petition
interest.
the
question
of
post
petition
interest
which
the
government
still
contends
for
in
many
cases
as
they
did
in
these
cases
below
is
not
yet
before
this
court,
but
we
suggest
that
the
effect
of
the
reading
which
we
have
urged
upon
the
court,
57j
and
67
is
not
to
completely
do
away
with
any
distinction
in
the
bankruptcy
act
between
lien
claims
and
non
lien
claims.
it
leaves
the
lien
claims,
a
valid
and
subsisting
with
respect
to
the
principal
of
the
taxes
but
it
does
give
full
effect
as
it
should
to
the
letter
and
spirit
of
57j
to
look
into
that
tax
lien
and
to
the
extent
the
tax
lien
includes
a
penalty
to
knock
out
that
penalty.
now
i'd
like
to
turn
very
briefly
to
part
of
the
judicial
history
of
this
problem
which
i
think
has
bearing
and
particularly
upon
the
argument
which
the
government
has
made
as
to
the
probable
intention
of
congress
and
the
amendments
to
the
chandler
act
in
1952.
this
issue
first
arose
appropriately
enough
in
the
ninth
circuit
from
which
we
come
with
these
cases
with
the
decision
in
knox-powell-stockton
in
1939.
that
was
the
first
circuit
court
decision
with
respect
to
this
penalty
issue
and
curiously
enough
and
as
a
matter
of
history,
in
that
case
it
was
a
california
tax
penalty
which
was
involved
and
the
united
states
government
at
that
time
in
that
case
was
contending
for
the
very
position
which
petitioners
here
are
contending
for
today.
in
that
case
it
was
of
course
to
the
advantage
of
the
united
states
to
try
and
upset
the
penalty
which
the
state
of
california
was
trying
to
collect.
they
were
unsuccessful
in
that
decision
in
a
fairly
short
decision
insofar
as
it
related
to
this
penalty
issue
and
the
knox-powell-stockton
case
in
1939
was
the
first
case
on
this.
the
issue
next
came
up
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
case
in
1943
in
the
sixth
circuit
to
which
i've
already
referred
and
that
case
which
is
a
very
brief
page
and
a
half
decision
again
involving
a
state
tax
penalty
rather
that
a
federal
tax
penalty
both
the
knox-powell-stockton
and
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
cases
were
state
tax
penalties,
in
a
very
brief
page
and
a
half
decision,
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
case
the
majority
of
the
two
in
effect
cited
in
section
57,
they
quoted
very
briefly
from
knox-powell-stockton
and
then
in
effect
recited
the
usual
matter
that
with
respect
to
giving
due
deference
to
the
opinion
of
other
circuits
in
trying
to
maintain
uniformity
particularly
in
tax
matters.
the
dissent
by
justice
simons
is
much
more
in
detail
and
as
a
much
clearer
in
lengthier
analysis
of
the
problem
actually.
the
only
other
decision
which
occurred
prior
to
1952
and
as
the
government
points
out,
section
57
was
amended
with
respect
to
some
minor
matters
the
only
other
decision
was
in
re
burch
which
was
a
1948
district
court
case
in
kansas,
which
went
the
--
went
against
the
government
in
favor
of
petitioners,
noting
among
other
things
that
since
knox-powell-stockton
had
been
decided,
that
the
chandler
act
had
been
amended
and
accordingly
they
didn't
think
that
the
knox-powell-stockton
decision
was
binding
and
of
course
it
was
in
another
circuit
as
well
and
in
addition
they
apparently
were
impressed
by
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
simons,
so
as
of
1952
when
congress
was
making
its
minor
amendments
to
the
statute
contrary
to
the
suggestion
made
by
the
government
and
its
brief,
the
law
if
anything
was
at
perhaps
unclear.
knox-powell-stockton
and
commonwealth
of
kentucky
with
a
divided
decision
in
that
second
case
had
indicated
only
with
respect
to
state
taxes
that
penalties
were
recoverable,
but
on
the
other
hand
of
the
--
at
least
this
one
district
court
case
said
--
indicated
to
the
contrary.
now
after
1952
a
series
of
decisions
came,
first
of
all
in
the
tenth
circuit,
the
grimland
case
which
is
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs
and
later
in
the
same
circuit,
the
mighell
case,
both
of
which
first
in
1953
and
1959
followed
the
lead
of
knox-powell-stockton,
but
again
without
any
very
lengthy
discussions
both
in
the
grimland
case
and
in
the
mighell
case,
the
tenth
circuit
in
effect
more
or
less
relied
upon
the
earlier
lead
of
knox-powell-stockton
and
commonwealth
of
kentucky
with
very
little
discussion
of
the
impact
of
this
penalty
problem
and
no
reference
in
the
grimland
case
for
example
to
the
gardner
case
which
i'll
refer
to
shortly.
when
the
matter
came
up
in
1959
in
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
mighell
case,
and
by
that
time
of
course
the
--
at
least
either
the
phillips
or
the
harrington
case
in
the
fifth
and
fourth
circuit
had
been
decided
and
the
court
failed
--
said,
“we
will
not
reconsider
this
issue
because
now
it
is
apparent
there
is
split
between
the
courts
which
can
only
be
resolved
by
this
--
by
the
supreme
court”,
so
actually
they
didn't
reexamine
the
matter.
in
the
harrington
and
the
philips
case
however,
the
harrington
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
philips
in
the
fifth
as
i
previously
indicated,
they
basically
took
exactly
the
position
which
petitioners
are
urging
here
today
which
allows
for
an
interpretation
of
both
57
and
--
57
and
the
other
sections
of
the
statute
and
reconciles
them
and
throws
out
the
penalty.
i
think
it
might
be
of
interest
also
to
note
that
in
connection
with
the
philips
case
and
the
harrington
case
both
of
which
were
decided
adversely
to
the
government,
and
no
certiorari
was
sought.
and
in
the
philips
case
for
example
the
penalty
which
was
involved
in
that
case
of
some
$2000
was
even
a
penalty
on
a
tax
which
had
been
paid
by
taxpayer
some
six
months
prior
to
the
bankruptcy
and
the
government
was
in
the
position
of
coming
in
to
assert
and
try
to
collect
the
penalty
in
the
bankruptcy
with
respect
to
a
tax
which
have
been
paid
long
before
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
then
in
addition
after
these
decisions
of
the
harrington
and
philips
case,
a
number
of
district
court
cases
followed
and
actually
at
the
present
time
district
court
cases
in
the
third,
second
and
eighth
circuit
as
cited
in
our
briefs
have
sustained
the
position
taken
by
petitioner
and
only
one
in
affect
or
two,
but
one
of
those
is
in
a
circuit
where
it
was
already
decided
to
followed
the
position
of
the
government.
now
i
mention
this
only
because
i
think
it
brings
out
two
points.
first
of
all
that
it
is
not
at
all
clear
as
the
government
has
suggested
that
when
congress
amended
the
section
57j
in
1952
that
it
somehow
must
have
taken
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
law
was
in
the
state
and
was
apparently
happy
to
leave
it
in
that
state
with
penalties
being
recoverable.
the
decisions
were
by
no
means
consistent
and
they
could
just
as
well
have
concluded
that
the
law
in
this
area
of
bankruptcy
as
in
others
was
a
little
bit
in
doubt
and
there
was
certainly
opportunity
that
a
judicial
decision
would
straighten
this
out
without
the
necessity
of
actual
change
in
the
statute
itself.
of
course
subsequently
congress
did
amend
the
statute
with
respect
to
making
penalties
non-recoverable
very
specifically
but
that
as
the
reports
indicate
that
was
--
was
vetoed
and
accordingly
did
not
change
the
law.
i
would
like
to
close
then
very
briefly
with
only
two
comments
with
respect
to
the
gardner
case
and
the
goggin
case,
both
of
which
had
been
cited
by
the
government.
the
gardner
case,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
as
authority
for
the
fact
that
was
the
unanimous
decision
with
the
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
douglas
in
1946,
in
which
the
court
discussed
in
a
railroad
reorganization
this
whole
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
penalties
were
recoverable
and
the
--
and
other
issues
and
specifically
the
court
discusses
and
recognizes
that
the
--
that
the
bankruptcy
court
in
this
case,
a
reorganization
court
can
look
into
what
--
what
lies
behind
a
tax
lien,
there
was
a
tax
lien
of
new
jersey,
and
among
other
things
if
they
find
it
in
includes
penalties
which
are
not
permissible
or
not
recoverable,
to
look
into
that.
now
we
concede
as
we
do
in
our
brief
that
the
gardner
case
is
dicta
because
of
the
procedural
manner
in
which
in
came
up
but
nevertheless
we
suggest
that
it
is
very
persuasive
dicta
and
it
deals
and
discusses
in
considerable
detail
and
with
specific
mention
of
tax
penalties,
this
very
question
with
which
we
are
concerned
here
today.
now
the
government
has
made
much
in
its
brief,
and
in
the
other
courts
of
the
goggin
case
which
followed
some
two
years
later
by
the
very
same
court,
and
where
the
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
burton
has
some
general
discussion
about
the
status
of
lien
claims
with
which
we
do
not
disagree,
but
i
like
to
remind
the
court
only
of
this
one
additional
point
about
the
goggin
case.
if
the
gardner
case
was
dicta,
certainly
the
goggin
case
was
equally
so
for
what
that
is
worth
because
in
a
footnote
on
page
3
of
100
page
--
of
footnote
3
on
page
124
of
the
decision,
we
find
the
following
language,
there
is
no
issue
here
as
to
the
amount
of
penalties
or
interest
included
in
the
collector's
claim
for
taxes
or
as
to
the
data
--
date
to
which
interest
on
such
claim
should
be
computed,
in
fact
the
amount
of
money
involved
--
excuse
me
your
honor
--
mr.
donald
a.
schmechel
i'm
reading
from
the
goggin
case
your
honor.
mr.
donald
a.
schmechel
g-o-g-g-i-n.
in
fact
in
the
goggin
case
the
total
amount
of
money
which
the
bankruptcy
court
had
was
less
than
the
principle
amount
of
the
taxes
which
the
government
--
which
were
being
claimed
so
it
really
never
was
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
any
penalties
were
to
be
included
or
not.
and
the
real
issue
of
the
goggin
case
which
is
decided
as
they
say
by
the
same
court
that
decided
the
gardner
case,
the
real
issue
there
was
simply
the
one
whether
or
not
where
the
government
had
taken
possession
as
they
have
there
a
personal
property
prior
to
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
being
started
whether
or
not
under
those
circumstances
with
possession
prior
to
bankruptcy
whether
the
government
would
prevail
as
against
certain
wage
claimants
under
the
priority
section
of
the
statute.
and
the
court
held
we
think
quite
properly
on
a
very
narrow
issue
that
the
rights
were
determined
as
of
the
time
of
the
filing
of
bankruptcy
and
that
as
of
that
time
the
government
having
possession
of
the
personal
property
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
they
later
came
in
and
allowed
the
trustee
to
sell
it
that
they
were
not
to
be
placed
below
the
wage
claimants
under
section
64
of
the
act.
mr.
donald
a.
schmechel
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
i'm
not
surprised
if
there
is
confusion
in
the
bankruptcy
laws
and
the
law
of
no
regulation
apparently
and
there
are
many
reasons
for
this
and
i
--
in
all
the
sincerity
and
the
seriousness
would
say
that
there
--
two
of
the
reasons
for
these
areas
of
doubt,
not
only
referred
to
us
of
penalty
but
other
areas
the
bankruptcy
law
as
well
relate
to
this
fact
that
over
a
long
period
of
years
in
the
courts
of
this
land
including
the
supreme
court,
the
position
of
the
government
with
respect
to
taxes
insofar
as
they
relate
to
bankruptcy
has
been
generally
within
this
context.
they
started
out
basically
in
insisting
that
regardless
of
the
absence
of
specific
language
in
the
bankruptcy
act
at
some
point
or
not
that
the
general
language
of
the
internal
revenue
codes
superseded
are
superior
to
the
bankruptcy
act.
and
secondly,
throughout
their
efforts
to
collect
is
a
practical
matter
in
the
bankruptcy
actions
over
the
years,
the
one
thread
that
runs
through
there
more
than
anything
else
is
that
the
government
as
in
other
tax
cases
has
been
very
considerably
influenced
by
which
position
will
bring
it
most
revenue
and
i
fully
recognize
does
this
court
a
necessity
is
the
revenue
necessities
to
the
government.
but
this
is
the
reason
in
part,
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
has
been
difficult
to
resolve
that
in
early
stage,
some
of
these
problems
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
and
i
again
remind
the
court
that
in
1939
on
the
knox-powell-stockton
case
came
before
the
ninth
circuit,
the
first
circuit
court
opinion
on
this
matter
of
penalty
that
although
these
provisions,
57j
had
been
in
the
bankruptcy
statute
since
1898,
some
41
years
the
initial
position
of
the
government
in
that
case
was
to
say
the
state
of
california
cannot
recover
a
tax
penalty
because
it's
precluded
from
doing
so
under
57j.
and
the
next
two
cases
that
came
up
as
i
indicated
were
actually
state
court
cases
where
the
government
admittedly
did
--
take
the
other
position
this
court's
following
knox-powell-stockton.
now
i
cited
to
the
court
the
gardner
case,
but
i
did
not
read
the
language
from
it
and
i
want
to
come
back
to
that
because
i
think
it
may
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
this
court
has
had.
reading
and
its
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
14,
reading
from
page
580
of
the
gardner
case
and
the
decision
by
mr.
justice
douglas.
this
was
a
case
incidentally
where
new
jersey
was
asserting
under
its
statutes
a
generalized
tax
lien
against
all
the
properties
of
the
bankrupt
railroad
including
not
only
principle
of
taxes
and
interest,
but
penalties
as
well
in
very
substantial
amounts
and
granted
it
is
dicta
and
nevertheless
here's
what
the
court
said
and
i
am
quoting,
“the
reorganization
court
may
also
adjudicate
questions
pertaining
to
the
amount
of
a
tax
claim
secured
by
a
lien.”
we're
not
crossing
the
forbidden
line
marked
by
arkansas
corporation
commission
versus
thompson,
313
us
132.
there
is
for
example
the
question
whether
the
amount
of
the
claim
is
topping
now
by
the
security
tax
claim,
whether
the
amount
of
the
claim
has
been
swollen
by
the
inclusion
of
a
forbidden
penalty
and
thus
to
that
extent
does
not
meet
the
bankruptcy
requirements
for
proof
and
allowance
of
claims.
section
57j
of
the
bankruptcy
act
provides
that
debts
owing
estate
as
a
penalty
or
forfeiture
shall
not
be
allowed
and
then
the
court
in
its
footnote
cites
section
57j
of
the
bankruptcy
act
as
is
it
today
in
full.
now
granted
that's
dicta,
nevertheless
it
comes
precisely
to
the
point
that
is
before
the
court
here
today.
and
it
applies
not
only
in
the
reorganization
proceedings
where
if
anything
the
powers
of
the
court
are
broader
or
in
addition
to
what
they
are
in
the
bankruptcy,
but
it
comes
right
down
to
an
ordinary
bankruptcy
proceedings
as
well.
the
machinery
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
this
was
urged
to
the
court
of
the
gardner
case
is
the
machinery
for
the
handling
of
secured
as
well
as
unsecured
claims.
despite
the
language
that
the
government
has
used
in
this
argument,
in
a
secured
claim
the
government
does
come
in,
it
files
the
claim,
it
asks
for
an
order
which
whether
you
use
the
word
allowance
or
denying
or
granting
it's
claim
in
part,
the
court
goes
behind
that
claim
to
determine
whether
the
amount
of
the
tax
claim
is
correct
with
reference
to
its
principal,
with
reference
to
its
interest
and
we
say
under
57j
and
along
with
other
things
love
to
see
whether
any
part
of
the
lien,
the
tax
lien
is
for
penalties
and
if
so,
disregard
that
part
of
it,
but
give
full
respect
and
accord
to
the
lien
of
the
taxes
for
the
principal.
now,
i
submit
that
the
language
in
the
gardner
case
is
directly
in
point
with
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
that
it
applies
not
only
in
the
reorganization,
but
it
applies
in
the
ordinary
bankruptcy
as
well
and
if
the
goggin
case
which
followed
it
--
follows
it,
it
seems
to
me
is
explainable
as
i
indicated
as
on
a
very
narrow
point
that
there
they
were
concerned
with
the
priorities
under
section
64
of
the
act
where
expenses
of
administration
and
secondary
wage
claimants,
congress
has
given
a
priority
even
over
tax
lien
to
some
extent,
but
said
that
with
respect
to
tax
liens
on
personal
property
that
they
shall
not
take
precedence
over
labor
of
claims
under
64,
unless
accompanied
by
possession.
in
the
goggin
case,
the
government
had
possessions
of
the
personal
property
and
under
a
valid
tax
lien
prior
to
the
bankruptcy,
so
really
that
decision
does
no
more
than
to
say
yes
under
those
circumstances,
there
rights
must
be
treated
as
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
they
had
a
possession,
they
had
a
lien
on
the
personal
property,
therefore,
they
are
not
subordinated
to
the
claims
of
labor
under
section
64.
the
goggin
case
in
effect
does
in
our
opinion,
no
more
than
that.
now,
the
government
in
its
brief
and
its
argument
has
made
the
fair
amount
out
of
this
matter
of
reading
of
section
57j
in
its
context.
the
suggestion
is
because
the
general
context
of
just
that
area
of
the
bankruptcy
act
has
to
do
with
proof
and
allowability
of
claims
and
they
argue,
this
means
only
unsecured
claims
that
therefore
it
can
have
no
effect
in
--
with
reference
to
section
67.
now
that
argument
is
good
for
the
government
in
that
respect
seems
to
me
we
are
open
to
raise
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
section
67
as
i
tried
to
indicate
before.
when
you
get
the
67b,
the
thing
which
the
section
starts
out
with
that
it
is
primary
concerned
with
is,
"the
provisions
of
section
60
of
this
act
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
statutory
liens"
and
it
goes
on
in
various
ways.
this
is
the
context
of
this
provision
of
67b,
if
the
court
please,
following
the
attack
of
the
government
in
analyzing
57j,
it
is
to
try
and
protect
the
tax,
secured
tax
claimant
and
other
lien
claimants
against
certain
hazards
which
it
would
be
exposed
to
under
section
60
which
deals
--
section
60
dealing
with
preferences
and
fraudulent
transfers
and
various
things
of
that
kind.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
is
to
be
the
test
of
how
you
analyze
these
two
sections
of
the
statute,
well
then
we're
just
as
entitled
as
the
government
if
not
more
so
to
that
benefit,
but
i
would
say
that
it
is
more
important
for
this
court
in
analyzing
both
section
67
and
57j
to
look
to
the
general
purpose
and
tenor
of
the
bankruptcy
act
in
what
it's
seeking
to
accomplish
and
certainly
if
you
look
to
the
purpose
and
tenor
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
decisions
under
it,
then
i
suggest
indeed
that
this
court
in
interpreting
any
one
single
section
of
a
very
complex
related
act
to
that
kind
should
come
out
with
the
result
which
a
result
petitioners
urge
here
which
gives
effect
to
both
sections
and
is
consistent
with
the
general
purposes
of
the
act
and
consistent
with
the
thought
that
penalties
are
peculiarly
something
which
should
not
be
recovered
in
bankruptcy.
now,
the
government
has
also
made
considerable
contention
about
this
matter
of
possession.
of
course
it's
not
an
unusual
thing
in
the
law
for
the
courts
to
find
that
someone
in
possession
property
may
find
the
rights
are
little
greater
or
little
easier
to
defend
and
when
he
doesn't
have
possession.
i
will
say
this
that
after
all
possession
even
as
to
non-secured
creditor
with
the
bankruptcy
act
is
an
important
thing.
an
insolvent
can
pay
even
a
general
creditor
and
accept
to
the
extent
that
it
may
be
a
preference
within
a
four-month
period
under
the
statute
or
fraudulent
transfer
or
something
and
he
will
be
entitled
to
keep
his
money.
and
in
the
same
way
a
secured
creditor
whether
it's
a
secured
creditor
with
the
lien
for
taxes
or
otherwise
if
he
gets
payment,
whether
it's
by
attaching
and
getting
property,
whether
its
money
or
whatever
it
is
of
course,
the
fact
that
possession
has
certain
consequences.
and
if
the
property
in
case
for
example
is
not
worth
any
more
than
the
principal
of
these
taxes,
you
wouldn't
even
get
to
the
issue
of
penalty.
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer
completely
what
the
effect
would
be
under
all
circumstances
and
the
court
raised
this
question
as
to
whether
if
a
person
had
possession
of
property
that
this
would
preclude
a
reorganization
trustee
or
an
ordinary
bankruptcy
trustee
from
bringing
the
government
or
any
other
lien
claimant
into
court
to
determine
the
extent
or
circumstances
if
any
under
which
it
might
be
necessary
for
--
to
reclaim
possession.
of
course,
in
many
cases
the
amount
of
the
tax
might
be
such
that
it
exceeds
the
value
of
the
property
that
the
issue
wouldn't
be
before
it.
but
in
connection
with
reorganizations
which
are
basically
governed
by
the
same
law
here
as
your
ordinary
bankruptcy
and
ours
is
a
corporate
reorganization
of
the
utility,
i
want
to
remind
the
court
that
if
the
various
state
and
the
local
authorities,
the
taxing
authorities
pursuant
to
liens
which
might
include
penalties
or
the
federal
government
itself
proceed
to
take
possession
of
property,
in
particular,
if
there's
a
real
debate
as
to
the
value
of
their
property
being
in
access
of
the
amount
of
the
taxes,
obviously,
there
could
be
a
frustration
of
the
purposes
of
the
reorganization
statutes.
and
i
myself
think
that
there
may
be
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
reorganization
trustee,
for
example,
or
bankruptcy
trustee
might
bring
them
before
the
court
and
under
certain
circumstances,
the
property
might
be
turned
in.
of
course,
frequently
the
government
as
they've
indicated
voluntarily
to
a
property
and
other
lien
claimants
too
because
there're
advantages
to
them,
they
can
--
it
can
be
sold
more
readily
in
the
machinery
of
the
bankruptcy
court
taking
clear
of
liens
and
they
may
realize
more
for
their
money.
so
frequently,
the
problem
resolves
itself
at
a
practical
level.
now,
the
court
asked
a
question
with
regard
to
the
--
whether
or
not
this
taxes
generally
and
the
penalties
are
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy.
now
we
have
raised
this
question
in
our
brief,
and
i'd
like
to
comment
a
little
further
on
it
also.
now,
keep
in
mind
that
the
penalty
is
the
penalty
against
the
taxpayer,
because
he
doesn't
filed
his
return
on
time
or
paid
his
tax
on
time
or
something
else.
the
government
whether
its
state
or
federal
has
not
lost
anything
in
the
normal
sense
if
they
get
their
tax
plus
interest
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
and
the
person
who
has
defaulted
is
the
taxpayer,
but
if
you
allow
the
penalty
to
be
collected
as
part
of
a
lien
in
bankruptcy,
why
then
of
course
you're
penalizing
the
labor
claimants
and
the
cost
of
administration
under
some
circumstances
and
in
most
cases,
the
general
creditors.
now,
actually
the
government
does
try
to
collect
the
penalty
tax
under
section
17
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
language
just
says
that
taxes
are
not
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy
without
defining
what
is
included
in
taxes.
so
there's
no
question
for
that
as
to
the
principal
of
taxes
that
the
government
can
and
does
try
to
collect
from
the
bankrupt
even
after
his
discharge.
now
in
the
u.s.
versus
michelle,
a
tenth
--
the
tenth
circuit
case,
273
f.2d
682
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
is
the
second
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
which
they
decided
on
this
penalty
issue,
this
was
actually
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
collect
that
tax
penalty
after
bankruptcy,
after
discharge
from
the
bankrupt.
now
this
is
the
only
case
of
that
kind,
but
i
suggest
we
can
well
assume
that
the
government
will
in
other
circuits
as
far
as
possible,
or
at
least
until
there's
a
decision
by
this
court
will
attempt
to
collect
tax
penalties
from
the
bankrupt
after
a
discharge.
and
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
we
say
that
that's
where
they
should
try
to
collect
it
rather
than
seeking
to
collect
it
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
where
it
necessarily
penalizes
the
other
creditors
and
corrupts
in
many
ways
the
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
act
itself.
take
for
example
in
the
reorganization
such
as
the
reorganization
in
the
harris
case
of
a
small
telephone
company
and
keep
in
mind
as
the
record
shows
that
before
bankruptcy,
the
government
had
an
offer
and
compromise
and
was
apparently
giving
consideration
to
accepting
57,000
of
principle
of
the
taxes
and
(inaudible)
end
of
it.
what
happens
in
the
reorganization
is
exactly
this?
if
the
reorganization
is
successful
to
the
extent
it's
successful
and
the
government
begins
to
see
that
the
chances
are
so
good
and
after
all
they
should
ride
along,
and
they
should
collect
not
only
the
principal
of
their
taxes,
but
the
interest
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy
and
the
penalties
that
they're
supported
by
a
lien
and
they're
also
as
they
did
in
this
case,
seeking
to
recover
post
petition
interest
as
well.
this
was
denied
under
a
recent
ninth
circuit
decision
and
the
harrington
case
also
denied
it
to
them
in
another
circuit
so
there
are
now
two
circuit
court
decisions
saying
they
can't
get
post
petition
interest
in
a
reorganization
or
bankruptcy
even
though
its
supported
by
a
lien,
but
that
issue
has
not
been
before
this
court
for
settled.
and
this
is
merely
illustration
again
of
my
point
that
the
one
consistent
thread
through
all
this
is
that
indeed
bankruptcy
cases
at
the
practical
level,
in
the
district
court
and
circuit
court,
the
government's
basic
position;
first
with
reference
to
the
interest
on
non
lien
tax
claims
which
they
finally
lost
in
the
safer
case,
then
with
respect
to
penalties,
next
with
respect
to
post
petition
interest
on
lien
claims
and
so
it
go,
the
one
thread
running
through
all
of
it
is
that
the
government
consistently
tries
to
take
the
position
which
will
net
it
the
most
revenue.
and
this
unfortunately
has
not
easy
before
the
trustees
or
the
bankruptcy
courts
to
resolve
these
issues.
now,
let
me
close
by
only
one
other
comment.
i
think
that
in
addition
as
i
mentioned
to
the
fact
that
the
language
of
the
statute
we
think
can
be
read
to
disallow
these
penalties
or
deny
them,
whatever
phrase
you
want
to
use.
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
and
that
this
is
the
real
--
the
only
really
sensible
construction
in
our
opinion
of
these
sections
of
the
statute.
in
addition
to
that,
if
the
court
feels
that
the
languages
57j
is
--
leaves
something
to
be
desired
and
i
don't
pretend
that
it's
as
clear
as
it
might
be,
i
think
the
court
still
can
rely
upon
the
general
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
and
the
fact
that
where
there
is
a
conflict
between
it
and
a
revenue
act
that
it
ought
to
prevail
and
take
cognizance
of
this
matter
and
the
equity
power
of
the
court
with
respect
to
penalties.
and
this
for
example
is
cited
by
professor
moore
in
his
bankruptcy
treaties
and
which
he
says
in
effect
that
disallowance
theory
needs
talking
about
the
disallowance
of
penalties
can
also
be
supported
without
resort
to
either
section
of
the
act
exclusively
but
rather
upon
established
equitable
principles
applicable
to
individual's
rights
which
prohibit
enforcement
of
penalty
or
forfeiture
clauses
in
context,
(inaudible)
6307.
in
other
words,
if
there
is
in
the
court's
mind
any
thought
that
the
language
of
57j
is
perhaps
a
little
inept,
nevertheless,
the
court
use
that
as
an
additional
reason
to
sustain
our
contention
that
the
penalty
should
not
be
recovered
or
payable
in
the
bankruptcy.
thank
you.
