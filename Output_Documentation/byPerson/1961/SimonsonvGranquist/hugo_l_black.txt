a
heavy
priority

indicated
in
some
kind
of
an
act
it
didn't
enact.

a
lien
on
something
that
is
owing
i
guess.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
owing
so
far
as
the
bankrupt
is
concern
than
57j
is
valid,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
get
it
into
a
bankruptcy
court
out
of
that
security.
that
is

(inaudible)
the
whole
thing
in

was
passed?

1898.
justice
hugo

they're
not
affecting

they're
affecting
it
as
a
penalty

purpose
to
do
and
waive
a
collection
of
--
justice
hugo

black
why
do
you
think
congress
wanted
to
protect
a
bankrupt
estate
against
the
collection
government
liens
(inaudible),
what
was
its
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
protect
what?
justice
hugo

black
or
any
other
creditor?
justice
hugo
l.

it
didn't
want
them
subjected
to

the
effect
of

they
didn't
(inaudible)
tried
to
invalidate
penalties
as
a
general
(inaudible)

but
they
were
entered
as
(inaudible)
protecting
the
estate
of
the
bankrupt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
the
status
of
the
claim
remains
the
same
but
the
status
of
the
penalty
doesn't.
somehow
the
penalty
has
changed
the
status.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
say
it
was
so
much
ensured?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
curious.
i
don't
(inaudible).
that
is
the
government
had
possession
of
the
property
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
bankrupt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
could
sell
that
property
and
wouldn't
have
to
make
them
count
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
the
penalty
that
it
--
they
took
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
be
so
sure
that
it
be
allowed
to
hold
that
penalty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
statute
should
be
held
to
mean
that
the

against

justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
i'll
tell
you
where
you
bother
me.
i
have
somehow
been
brought
up
to
assume
and
that
is
you
didn't
find
penalties
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
law
is
not
seeking
and
searching
for
penalty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
here
is
the
statute
which
says
that
you
can't
be
allowed
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
want
us
to
find
by
implication
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
said
you
should
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
language
--
it
says
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
point
that
to
me
in
some
language
where
i
can
see
that
congress
has
said
that
so
far
as
penalties
are
concerned
they
can
be
collected
by
the
government
against
bankrupt
if
they
flied
it
so
as
we
get
a
lien
under
an
ordinary
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
you
attempt
to
get
(inaudible)
--
maybe
the
court
has
decided
against
you
but
it's
certainly
a
penalty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
must
say
that
i
would
think
if
you
have
a
heart
for
the
government
(inaudible)
in
that
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
you
are
right
on
your
interpretation
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
proportionately
diminished
unless
the
court
took
the
position
that
the
bankrupt
estate
was
entitled
not
to
have
that
penalty
ii
court
with
regard
to
where
the
property
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
construed
--
what
i'm
saying
is,
if
you
construe
this
as
meaning,
direct
unequivocal
which
you
could
say
--
you'd
raise
the
question
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
construed
as
meaning
(inaudible)
on
the
part
of
congress
that
in
an
estate,
bankrupt
estate
not
(inaudible)
burdened
by
the
collection
of
a
tax
penalty.
then
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
who
had
possession
of
the
property,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
i
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
with
that
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
(inaudible)
differently
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
--
one
might
express
that
as
being

if
you
refused
to
read
into
the
act
that
is
--
that
it
intended
to
exempt
--
secured
debt
(inaudible)
rather
than
the
other
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
think
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
don't
of
course
eliminate
what
congress
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
say
it's
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
its
broad
enough
to
include
them,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
sometimes
i
have
an
inclination
to
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
anything
involved
in
this
one
except
the
penalty?
justice

(inaudible)
the
intention
of
congress.
justice
hugo

well,
you
find
the
facts
where?
