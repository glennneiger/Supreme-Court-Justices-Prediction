mr.
fred
a.
granata
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
concerned
here
only
with
the
one
issue
found
in
the
simonson
case
and
that
issue
stated
briefly
is
whether
the
language
of
section
70c
of
the
bankruptcy
act
gives
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
the
status
of
a
judgment
creditor
so
that
under
section
6323
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
he
prevails
to
invalidate
an
unrecorded
tax
lien.
i
emphasize
that
although
the
tax
lien
arose
prior
to
bankruptcy
by
virtue
of
a
demand
the
notice
of
the
lien
was
not
recorded
until
subsequent
to
the
bankrupt
filing
his
involuntary
petition
or
his
voluntary
petition.
the
government
has
contended
that
this
lien
is
valid
against
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
because
he
is
not
one
of
the
classes
of
persons
mentioned
in
section
6323
which
in
part
reads
that
the
lien
imposed
by
section
6321
shall
not
be
valid
against
any
mortgagee,
pledgee,
purchaser
or
judgment
creditor
until
notice
thereof
has
been
filed.
the
trustee
contends
that
section
70c
of
the
bankruptcy
act
in
effect
makes
him
a
judgment
creditor
or
gives
him
all
the
rights,
remedies
and
powers
of
a
judgment
creditor.
section
70c
reads
in
part
that
the
trustee
as
to
all
property,
whether
or
not
coming
into
possession
or
control
of
the
court
upon
which
a
creditor
of
the
bankrupt
could
have
obtained
the
lien
by
legal
or
equitable
proceedings
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy
shall
be
deemed
divested
as
of
such
date
and
with
all
the
rights,
remedies
and
powers
of
a
creditor
then
holding
a
lien
thereon
by
such
proceedings,
whether
or
not
a
creditor
actually
exists.
the
plain
meaning
of
this
section
is
that
the
trustee
has
the
rights,
remedies
and
powers
of
a
judgment
creditor.
it
could
not
be
any
more
definitive
in
its
language.
the
statute
does
not
say
that
he
is
a
judgment
creditor,
but
it
says
that
he
has
the
rights,
powers
and
remedies
of
a
creditor
holding
a
lien
which
is
in
the
effect
what
a
judgment
creditor
is.
logically
then,
the
trustee
should
prevail
over
an
unrecorded
tax
lien
because
he
has
such
rights,
in
fact
he
has
all
the
rights,
remedies
and
powers
of
a
judgment
creditor.
if
he
does
not
so
prevail
then
we
must
conclude
that
he
does
not
have
all
the
rights,
remedies
and
powers
given
to
him
by
section
70c.
now
this
court
has
never
precisely
ruled
on
this
question.
it
did
skirt
it
in
united
states
versus
gilbert
associates
in
345
u.s.
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
the
language
of
the
internal
revenue
section
6323
meant
judgment
creditor
only
in
the
usual
conventional
sense
of
those
terms,
but
we
submit
that
this
instant
case
is
distinguishable
from
the
gilbert
case.
the
gilbert
case
was
not
deciding
a
bankruptcy
question.
it
was
not
concerned
with
whether
the
trustee
was
a
judgment
creditor
within
the
purview
of
section
6323
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
it
was
deciding
priorities
between
the
lien
of
a
city
in
new
hampshire
whose
tax
was
found
by
the
state
court
in
new
hampshire
to
be
in
the
nature
of
a
judgment
and
the
federal
government's
unrecorded,
but
antecedent
tax
lien.
further,
the
gilbert
decision
was
predicated
by
a
desire
to
procure
uniformity
of
tax
law
among
the
states.
at
page
364
the
court
said,
the
cardinal
principle
of
congress
in
its
tax
scheme
is
uniformity
in
as
far
as
maybe.
in
this
case,
the
simonson
case,
there
could
be
no
danger
of
such
non-uniformity
because
it
involves
the
construction
of
federal
law
by
federal
courts.
in
the
gilbert
case,
there
could
possibly
be
construction
of
law
by
state
courts
which
would
interfere
with
the
federal
tax
lien.
now
all
lower
federal
courts
that
have
decided
this
precise
question
have
ruled
adversely
to
the
trustee
--
oh,
there's
one
exception
to
that
in
i
believe
the
second
circuit
but
they
later
after
the
decision
in
the
gilbert
case
took
a
contrary
position.
however
in
the
simonson
case
judge
hamley
while
concurring
with
the
rest
of
the
court
expressed
that
he
would
have
ruled
otherwise
had
it
been
the
case
of
first
impression.
in
the
in
re
fidelity
tube
corporation
decided
by
the
third
circuit
in
1960,
judge
kalodner
joined
by
judge
hastie
wrote
a
very
exhaustive
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
cited
various
cases
concerning
the
interpretation
of
70c.
now,
when
congress
passed
section
70c
it
made
it
abundantly
clear
what
it
intended.
the
report
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
which
considered
and
eventually
--
which
considered
the
amendment
to
bankruptcy
act
is
quoted
in
our
brief
at
page
21.
briefly
the
intention
was
to
protect
general
creditors
of
the
bankrupt
from
secret
liens,
and
to
give
all
creditors
rights
they
might
have
acquired
under
state
law
have
there
been
no
bankruptcy
and
rights
from
which
they
are
debarred
by
bankruptcy.
once
a
petition
in
bankruptcy
is
filed
the
creditors
may
not
seek
to
become
judgment
creditors.
they
can
only
pursue
their
rights
if
the
bankruptcy
law
gives
them.
to
rule
that
the
government's
lien
is
inferior
to
the
rights
of
the
trustee
would
in
no
way
hurt
the
government
because
if
they
wish
to
be
secured,
then
you'd
only
file
their
lien
duly.
the
revenue
sources
could
be
protected
in
this
manner.
now
in
its
brief
the
government
has
made
reference
to
section
67b
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
in
effect
would
allow
perfection
of
a
lien
subsequent
to
bankruptcy
where
it
arose
prior
to
bankruptcy
but
was
not
perfected
prior
to
bankruptcy.
now
this
statue
and
i
quote
in
part
reads,
“whereby
such
laws,
such
liens
are
required
to
be
perfected
and
arise
but
are
not
perfected
before
bankruptcy
they
may
nevertheless
be
valid
if
perfected
within
the
time
permitted
by
and
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
such
laws.”
now,
first
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
language
here
is
permissive
not
mandatory
since
they
may
be
nevertheless
valid.
now
this
has
been
interpreted
by
authorities
such
as
collier
on
bankruptcy
to
mean
that
where
the
applicable
lien
law
would
hold
the
statutory
lien
inferior
to
the
rights
of
a
creditor
with
a
judicial
lien
which
we
contend
are
rights,
powers,
and
remedies
given
to
the
trustee
by
70c,
then
the
judicial
lien
or
the
trustee
shall
prevail.
in
other
words
the
trustee
may
invoke
section
70c
to
(inaudible)
a
lien
unperfected
under
the
law
if
such
lien
is
not
valid
against
any
other
judgment
creditor.
now
the
importance
of
the
defeating
of
the
lien
is
this
that
if
there
is
no
lien
then
section
57j
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
specifically
prohibits
payment
of
penalties
to
the
united
states
comes
into
play.
the
government
has
not
contented
that
if
it
has
a
non-lien
tax
claim
that
it
is
entitled
to
penalty.
their
contention
is
only
that
if
the
claim
is
lien
that
they
are
entitled
to
collect
penalty
from
the
bankrupt
estate.
