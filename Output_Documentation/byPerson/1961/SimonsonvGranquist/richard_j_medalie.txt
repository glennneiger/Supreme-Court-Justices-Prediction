mr.
richard
j.
medalie
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
pleases
the
court.
the
government
is
in
perfect
agreement
with
the
petitioners
that
section
57j
does
operate
to
disallow
unsecured
claims
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
state
for
penalties.
wherein
we
disagree,
of
course,
is
in
the
petitioner's
contention
that
57j
also
operates
to
disallow
secured
claims.
it
is
our
contention
that
57j
has
no
such
effect.
now,
before
going
into
the
detailed
reasons
for
support
of
the
judgments
below,
i
should
just
like
to
make
one
point
with
respect
to
petitioner's
argument
on
the
equities.
we
don't
dispute
petitioner's
contention
that
a
secured
claim
for
tax
penalties
may
create
some
harmful
effect
on
unsecured
creditors.
indeed
congress
itself
has
indicated
time
and
time
again
that
it
is
concerned
with
the
possible
deleterious
effect
of
allowing
liens
to
come
before
unsecured
creditors
and
therefore
leaving
the
unsecured
creditors
without
sufficient
funds
in
the
bankruptcy
of
estate
to
pay
out
their
claims.
but
while
it
has
recognized
these
injustices,
it
has
made
specific
provision,
and
indeed
it
has
amended
the
statute
time
and
again,
in
order
to
deal
with
or
in
order
to
subordinate
specific
liens
or
invalidate
specific
liens,
nullifying
or
void
specific
liens,
but
in
none
of
these
instances
that
has
congress
seem
fit
to
nullify
or
invalidate
a
federal
or
state
tax
lien.
in
fact
quite
the
contrary,
congress
in
67b
has
stated
that
state
and
federal
tax
liens
shall
be
or
may
be
invalidated
as
against
the
trustees.
in
the
‘may'
is
with
respect
to
the
particular
laws
which
create
these
liens.
in
other
words,
if
these
liens
are
not
perfected
in
accordance
with
these
laws
then
of
course
the
trustee
prevails.
if
they
are,
so
says
congress
or
at
least
the
way
we
interpret
67b
then
the
lien
shall
prevail
as
against
the
trustee.
now
this,
therefore,
when
we
come
to
the
question
of
whether
a
specific
federal
tax
lien
for
penalties
is
valid
or
invalid
in
bankruptcy,
the
government
believes
that
that
question
cannot
be
decided
on
the
equities.
now
mind
you,
i'm
not
using
the
term
in
the
sense
that
a
bankruptcy
court
being
a
court
of
equity
cannot
operate
to
investigate
the
nature
of
the
lien
but
it
cannot
determine
it
on
the
equities
in
the
layman's
sense.
it
must
look
to
the
specific
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
it
must
look
to
the
particular
powers
of
the
trustee
in
the
court
in
order
to
establish
whether
that
lien
is
or
is
not
valid.
now
–
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
we
do
not
--
yes?
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh,
it's
constantly
recurring.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
the
--
as
we've
seen
there
is
a
considerable
split
of
a
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
and
district
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right
and
the
district
court
said
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i'm
getting
that
just
in
a
minute.
for
many
years
according
to
my
expert
here,
referees
have
been
granting
penalties
as
a
matter
of
course
along
with
the
tax
liens
and
it's
only
been
--
well,
when
this
problem
specifically
arose
before
the
particular
courts.
at
some
time,
at
one
time,
this
began
to
be
questioned
and
therefore
we've
now
had
the
split
of
authority.
i
should
point
out
as
petitioners
now
that
in
the
goggin
case
itself
in
which
the
government's
lien
was
validated,
that
was
a
lien
for
penalties
as
well
as
taxes.
now
we
agree
that
that
issue
was
not
in
the
case,
but
the
fact
that
the
issue
was
not
in
the
case
indicated
that
both
parties
and
indeed
the
referee,
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
as
well
as
the
supreme
court,
i
imagine,
didn't
really
consider
that
this
was
a
crucial
issue.
the
crucial
issue
was
whether
when
we
were
in
possession
of
the
property,
we
should
be
subordinated.
so
it
has
been
a
matter
of
course
and
it
has
only
been
in
recent
years
and
i
speak
of
recent
years
advisedly
it
does
go
back
to
the
1940s
that
this
problem
has
come
up
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh
the
difference
--
yes,
in
section
57j
says
that
that's
for
penalties
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
state
shall
not
be
allowed
in
bankruptcy.
our
contention
is
that
that
refers
to
unsecured
claims
only
without
--
in
other
words
a
claim
which
does
not
have
a
lien
attached
to
it.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
for
example
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
that's
the
effect,
i
--
what
i
--
but
we
don't
say
that
you
have
to
read
this
in.
our
position
is
that
this
is
the
effect
of
57j
because
if
you
will
look
at
the
context
of
57j
namely
section
57,
that
deals
exclusively
with
the
proof
and
allowance
of
unsecured
claims
and
of
the
unsecured
portion
of
secured
claims.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
only
in
--
well,
only
insofar
as
67b
gives
general
validity
to
federal
and
tax
--
federal
and
state
tax
liens.
now
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
it.
perhaps
an
example
may
clarify
this.
in
270
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
if
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it's
specifically
silent.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
precisely
so
and
if
you
will
allow
me
i
shall
try
to
explain
why
we
come
to
this
conclusion.
before
doing
so
or
as
the
preliminary
in
this
argument,
let
me
give
you
an
example,
an
example
that
this
court
itself
said
of
and
in
fact
decided
in
the
case
of
security
mortgage
company
versus
powers
which
is
at
278
u.s.
and
which
we
cite
at
footnote
--
or
in
one
of
the
footnotes
in
our
brief
at
page
14.
the
question
there
was
dealt
with
a
lien
for
a
contingent
claim.
now
there
is
no
question
that
a
contingent
claim
in
bankruptcy
is
unprovable
under
section
63d
and
because
it
is
unprovable
the
act
states
that
under
section
57d,
mind
you
another
subsection
of
our
general
section
57,
under
section
57d,
an
unsecured
claim
for
unsecured
contingent
claim
shall
not
be
allowed.n
ow,
the
problem
in
this
security
mortgage
company
case
was
that
there
was
an
un
--
there
was
a
claim,
a
contingent
claim,
but
it
was
secured
by
a
lien.
in
this
court
found
no
problem
with
the
case
at
all.
they
said,
“there
is
such
a
distinction
of
status
between
secured
and
unsecured
claims
that
while
an
unsecured
contingent
claim
will
be
disallowable
under
section
57d,
a
secured
claim,
a
claim,
a
contingent
claim
secured
by
a
lien
is
perfectly
valid.
it
is
perfectly
collectible
in
bankruptcy
and
we
say
that
applying
this
analogy
to
257j
which
is
again
within
the
same
structure,
while
an
unsecured
claim
for
penalties
is
quite
disallowable
under
bankruptcy,
a
lien
for
those
secured
penalties
must
be
considered
valid
and
must
be
considered
therefore
collectible.
and
to
carry
our
argument
one
step
further
and
i
think
that
this
will
really
highlight
the
--
what
we
really
are
talking
about,
when
we're
discussing
disallowance
of
claims
as
opposed
to
invalidity
of
liens,
we
do
not
disagree
with
petitioner
that
this
court
or
i
should
say
a
bankruptcy
court
has
complete
powers
as
a
court
of
equity
to
look
behind
the
lien,
to
inquire
into
the
validity
of
the
lien
itself
as
well
as
the
validity
of
the
debt
underlying
the
lien.
they
have
full
powers
to
do
that.
the
peculiarity
of
this
case
is
that
petitioners
do
not
question
the
validity,
the
validity
of
our
lien,
nor
do
they
question
the
validity
of
our
debt
nor
can
they,
because
after
all
the
debt
is
validated
by
the
statute
which
creates
the
tax
lean
statute
which
is
referred
into
67b,
a
debt
for
penalties
specifically
validated.
what
petitioners
says
is
that
a
valid
lien
for
a
valid
debt
must
be
disallowed
if
the
debt
underlying
debts
--
underlying
debt
is
for
penalties,
but
we
submit
that
pepper
v.
litton
cannot
be
used
as
a
basis
for
doing
that.
it
doesn't
stand
for
this
proposition.
what
in
effect
the
petitioners
want
to
do
is
strip
away
the
lien
itself
and
then
disallow
the
un
--
the
claim
underlying
as
an
unsecured
claim.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no
question
about
it.
congress
has
ex
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it
said
it
in
specific
language
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no
--
that's
right,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
that's
right,
they
--
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
the
difference
is
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
the
difference
is
the
lien
itself.
i
meant
the
fact
of
matter
is
that
dating
back
to
the
even
english
practice
the
whole
history
of
bankruptcy
has
been
this
fundamental
distinction
of
status
between
secured
claims
on
one
hand
and
unsecured
claims
on
the
other.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh
yes.
well,
the
problem
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
except
for
one
thing,
in
very
rare
cases
does
the
--
is
the
government's
lien
unsatisfied
by
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
57j
only
relates
to
government
debt
--
penalties,
state
and
federal
penalties.
it
relates
to
nothing
else.
i
mean
for
example,
i
think
i
can
highlight
this
but
i
do
make
that
a
contractual
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
for
the
--
for
an
unsecured
claim,
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
that's
--
well,
it
depends.
let's
say
the
government,
sorry,
the
government
may
come
into
bankruptcy
and
let's
say
its
lien
for
$5000
which
is
$3000
taxes
and
$2000
penalties,
that
disproportion
could
be
possible.
but
the
bankrupt
status
is
for
--
the
bankrupt
estate
involves
only
$4000.
now
the
government
if
it
comes
in
on
a
first
prior
or
--
well,
first
of
all,
you
would
have
administrative
expenses
paid
and
you'd
have
wage
claims
paid
and
then
the
government
will
have
its
lien
to
be
satisfied.
now
it
may
only
satisfy
its
lien
perhaps
there's
only
$2000
left
of
that
estate.
it
may
then
get
the
$2000.
and
i
suppose
then
the
question
is
well
now
--
well
it
can't
get
no
more
you
see
because
there
is
nothing
left
in
the
estate,
so
that's
the
extent
of
it.
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
course
by
government
lien
is
that
in
attaches
to
all
property
of
a
bankrupt,
not
only
for
a
specific
part
of
property.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it
is
a
very
heavy
priority,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
the
--
but
congress
--
but
our
position
is
that
although
congress
has
indicated
that
it
does
not
like
penalties,
on
the
other
hand
it
has
said
that
a
lien
is
a
--
it
should
be
considered
a
valid
lien
and
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
the
--
certainly
the
penalties
are
owing--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
perhaps
i
can
try
and
explain
it
this
way.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
57j
was
in
the
original
act
of
1898.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
i
should
men
--
i
should
mention
that
in
the
original
act
of
1898
there
was
67d
as
well
which
said
that
that
a
lien,
a
valid
and
existing
lien
shall
not
be
affected
by
the
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
reason
for
this
is
very
clear
because
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
but
the
whole
--
here
we
get
into
the
question
of
pepper
v.
litton
again
i
suppose.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no
well
--
alright,
here
we
get
into
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
right.
here
we
get
into
the
problem
at
least
what
is
--
what
may
have
bankruptcy
court
do
when
it
is
faced
with
the
lien
for
penalties
and
our
fundamental
position
is
that,
while
it
may
investigate
the
validity
of
the
lien
as
such
and
the
validity
of
the
underlying
debt
and
we
make
this
distinction
that
a
debt
for
penalty
is
a
valid
debt.
all
that
--
57j
does
not
say
that
a
debt
for
penalty
shall
be
invalided.
it
says
that
that
a
debt
for
penalty
shall
be
disallowed.
in
the
very
language
there
is
a
fundamental
distinction
between
the
concept
of
disallowance
on
the
one
hand
and
invalidation
on
the
other.
the
term
disallowance
only
relates
to
unsecured
claims,
you
cannot
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
in
order
to
protect
the
unsecured
creditors
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
the
unsecured
creditors
so
that
could
get
a
higher
pro
rata
share
of
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
or
any
other
creditors,
that's
to
be
sure.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no
question.
well
let
me
get
back
to
this
example
i
gave
at
the
beginning
again.
congress
made
perfectly
clear
that
a
contingent
claim
shall
not
be
allowed
in
bankruptcy
just
as
it
made
absolutely
clear
that
it
was
against
penalties
for
unsecured
claims
for
penalties
yet
this
court
had
no
difficulty
in
saying
that
a
lien
for
contingent
claim,
a
lien
on
--
that
secured
a
contingent
claim
was
perfectly
valid,
despite
the
fact
that
congress
made
specific
mention
in
57d
that
contingent
claim
shall
not
be
allowable.
this
--
incidentally,
this
argument
has
continuously
come
up
before
this
court.
for
example
in
the
city
of
richmond
versus
berg,
the
government
itself
at
that
stage
said
that
we
have
a
first
priority
as
far
as
taxes
are
concerned.
at
that
time
of
the
governments
tax
on
--
even
and
unsecured
claim
was
first
priority,
therefore,
since
taxes
are
taxes
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
liens
are
first
or
unsecured
claims
are
first,
we
should
come
first
because
of
our
priority.
yet,
this
court
had
no
difficulty
in
saying
that
a
lien
for
a
contingent
rent
claim
was
perfectly
valid
as
against
our
priority,
even
though
a
contingent
rent
claim
if
it
had
not
been
secured
by
a
lien
would
of
course
have
been
unprovable
under
63d
and
disallowable
under
section
57j.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
no
--
no.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
(inaudible)
--
it's
discharged,
except
for
a
--
as
section
17
allows
of
the
claims
to
continue.
for
example
a
government's
claims
for
taxes
whether
or
not
its
--
it
may
realize
it
in
bankruptcy
that
continues.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that
survives
bankruptcy,
as
those
liens
survive
bankruptcy
if
it
cannot
be
realized.
but
a
claim
that
is
unprovable
and
disallowable,
that
is
discharge
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
it
is
--
so
long
--
well
for
example,
i
think
perhaps
you're
thinking
of
a
--
perhaps
a
preferential
lien
or
judicial
lien.
now,
those
liens
are
avoided
in
bankruptcy
but
the
lien
holders
at
that
stage
might
--
may
come
in
as
unsecured
creditors
in
order
to
try
to
get
their
claims
realized
as
an
unsecured
creditor.
in
other
words
the
fact
that
a
bankruptcy
court
may
disallow
a
lien
--
i'm
sorry,
not
just
avoid
the
lien.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it
reduces
them
to
general
credit.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
their
allowable
claims
in
the
bankruptcy
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
but
there
are
--
sir
for
example,
a
contingent
claim
is
not
allowable
under
any
circumstances
because
under
63d
it
is
unprovable.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it
is
discharge.
absolutely
discharge
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
if
it
is
unsecured
by
a
lien
and
that
was
precisely
the
distinction.
that
was
the
precisely
the
distinction
that
this
court
made
in
the
powers
case
in
278
us.
the
reason
why
we
have
this
distinction
between
disallowance
of
unsecured
claims,
its
invalidation
of
liens
is
because
a
lien
is
a
charge
on
the
property
which
comes
in
to
bankruptcy.
for
example,
if
a
valid
and
preexisting
lien
exists
--
if
property
which
has
a
valid
and
preexisting
lien
passes
to
the
trustee
its
virtually
black
letter
law
that
it
passes
as
they
say
(inaudible)
passes
subject
to
the
lien
and
this
is
why
section
67b
of
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1898
which
was
incidentally
the
predecessor
of
67b.
this
is
why
67b
stated
that
a
valid
lien
shall
not
be
affected
by
bankruptcy
and
indeed
this
is
why
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
knox-powell
case
specifically
stated
that
since
an
adjudication
in
bankruptcy
does
not
affect
the
valid
lien
section
57j
cannot
be
operative
to
disallow
--
disallow
a
lien
for
penalties
and
indeed
this
court
goggin
and
i
might
point
out
which
we
stated
did
involve
a
lien
for
penalties
although
that
was
not
an
issue,
this
court
in
goggin
did
cite
the
knox-powell
case
with
authority
and
did
say
that
the
chandler
act
amendments
did
nothing
to
harm,
destroy
or
changed
the
congressional
purpose
of
maintaining
the
vitality
of
claims
which
are
secured
by
liens.
perhaps,
i
can
highlight
this
in
a
slightly
different
way.
we
have
to
approach
it
from
different
directions
to
try
to
perhaps
overcome
as
i
see
it
a
very
perfectly
normal
idea
in
your
mind
that
when
congress
does
say
liens
are
--
penalties
are
invalid,
they're
invalid,
but
let
me
highlight
it
from
this
point
of
view.
let
us
contrast
the
secured
creditor
on
the
one
hand
and
the
unsecured
creditor
on
the
other.
the
procedures
to
which
they
must
go
before
they
may
realize
on
their
claim.
now
it's
clear
that
if
an
unsecured
creditor
wishes
to
even
get
a
pro
rata
share
of
his
claim,
he
must
come
into
bankruptcy
and
file
and
prove
his
claim
under
section
57.
this
is
just
a
pro
forma
thing.
this
is
what
he
must
do.
on
the
other
hand,
a
secured
creditor
has
a
variety
of
choices.
for
example,
if
the
secured
creditor
has
the
property,
solely
and
properly
in
his
possession,
he
can
ignore
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
entirely.
he
can
decline
to
file
his
claim
and
rely
solely
on
his
security.
thus
for
example,
if
the
government
had
possession
of
this
property
prior
bankruptcy
and
indeed
this
was
an
example
which
this
court
discussed
in
the
goggin
case.
if
it
have
possession,
it
could
have
refused
to
enter
bankruptcy
and
realized
on
its
claim
and
no
section
of
the
bankruptcy
act
including
section
57j
could
have
harmed,
could
have
influ
--
could
have
affected
the
government's
claim
whatsoever.
the
government
may
have
--
could
have
sold
the
property
and
realized
out
of
that
--
the
proceeds
of
that
sale,
its
claim,
and
its
secured
claim
for
penalties
as
well
as
taxes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
because
the
secured
claim
would
also
have
attached
to
the
penalties
of
the
tax
--
under
the
bankrupts
--
under
the
federal
tax
statute,
under
the
income
tax
act,
i
think
it's
63596371
or
well
we
cite
it
anyway
in
our
brief,
a
penalty
is
as
integral
a
part
of
the
lien
as
the
tax
which
that
lien
secures.
in
other
words,
they
are
part
and
parcel
of
it.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right
but
the
debt
is
also
for
penalties.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes
if
--
well
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
no,
no,
no.
no,
no.
we
could
prove
our
debt
for
penalties.
the
only
thing
that
57j
says
is
that
it's
disallowable.
in
other
words
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
yes
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes
it
does.
there
is
a
distinction
between
provability
and
allowability.
one
may
prove
a
claim
but
not
allow
it.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
not
necessarily
although
i
will
grant
you
that
for
practical
purposes
i
suppose
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
but
again,
i
think
what's
happening
from
our
interchanges
that
again
you
are
discussing
an
unsecured
claim.
now
it's
whereas
a
lien
which
secures
that
claim
maybe
realized
and
what
i'm
trying
to
differentiate
is
the
secured
creditor
in
possession
and
the
secured
creditor
out
of
possession
because
if
we
were
in
possession
of
our
--
of
the
pro
--
of
property,
not
all
of
the
property
but
of
some
of
the
property,
we
would
not
have
had
to
come
into
bankruptcy.
we
could
have
sold
that
property.
we
could
have
received
--
we
could
have
realized
our
claim
for
penalties
and
taxes
out
of
that
property
and
the
trustee
could
not
have
done
a
single
thing
about
it
outside
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
--
well,
that's
right
but
my
--
our
position
is
that
when
a
secured
creditor
comes
into
bankruptcy,
he
does
not
prove
his
debt.
what
he
does
is
he
files
his
secured
claim
or
an
intervening
petition
in
order
to
preserve
his
secured
status
but
he
doesn't
prove
it
in
the
sense
that
he
proves
an
unsecured
claim.
he
proves
his
lien
if
--
or
he
shows
that
this
is
a
valid
lien
which
has
arisen
and
as
we
know,
a
tax
lien
arises
on
the
assessment
and
is
perfected
on
the
demand
for
payment.
so
that
he
doesn't
prove
it
has
an
unsecured
creditor
proves
his
unsecured
claim.
he
comes
into
bankruptcy
but
the
nature,
the
change
in
the
proceeding
does
not
or
should
not
change
the
nature
that
lien.
the
status
of
the
lien
remains
the
same
because
the
status
depends
not
on
possession
of
the
property.
the
status
depends
on
the
lien
on
that
property
entirely,
that
is
the
decisive
factor.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
sure,
that's
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
that's
--
it's
not
case
of
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
i
say
it
with
assurance
it
must
of
course
make
an
accounting
for
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
--
for
the
surplus
over
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
so
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh
well,
now
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
i
simply
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh,
well.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
i
suppose
that
that
puts
different
slant
on
it
i
suppose.
we
don't
disagree
that
if
the
statute
itself
had
said
that's
for
penalties
secured
as
well
as
unsecured
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
oh,
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
but
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i
think
wher
--
as
i
--
i
think
from
the
beginning
to
the
end,
we
do
approach
this
from
two
different
points
of
view.
i
don't
want
you
to
find
anything
by
implication.
what
we're
trying
to
say
is
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
the
only
thing
i
can
point
out
to
you
is
--
if
we
were
in
possession
of
this
property,
the
trustee
would
have
absolutely
no
power
and
i
say
this
really
unequivocally,
the
trustee
would
have
absolutely
no
power
to
get
--
to
attempt
to
get
to
that
portion
of
our
lien
claim
for
penalties.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh,
he
may
attempt
but
he
--
but
what,
of
course
what
we're
saying
is
you
can
try
anything.
the
question
is,
does
the
law
allow
--
does
the
law
allow
you
to
do
anything?
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
i
don't
think
so.
for
example,
the
only
powers
that
a
trustee
has
was
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
the
only
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
the
only
powers
that
the
trustee
has
in
bankruptcy
are
given
with
respect
to
liens
in
possession
are
in
--
is
in
section
23b.
23b
first
of
all
gives
the
trustee
the
right
--
gives
him
the
same
rights
as
he
bankrupt
himself
would've
had.
if
the
bankrupt
may
have
brought
a
plenary
suit
against
the
government,
so
to
--
may
the
trustee.
also
the
trustee
has
certain
powers
under
sections
60,
67
and
70
which
deal
with
liens
specifically
for
example,
partly
with
liens,
partly
with
transfers,
preferences
etcetera
to
bring
plenary
suits
in
order
to
get
a
turnover
or
in
order
to
have
the
court,
take
the
property
and
return
it
to
the
trustee
and
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
trustee
has
no
right,
however,
to
bring
any
other
type
of
suit
in
order
to
get
our
--
if
our
lien
is
valid
an
indeed
it
is
a
valid
lien
at
least
for
--
well,
for
analytical
purposes
outside
the
bankruptcy
at
least
when
we
are
in
position,
our
lien
is
valid
and
our
debt
is
valid
because
it's
given
a
specific
validity
in
the
income
tax
code
of
19
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
--
well
yes,
that's
right.
they
create
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
--
in
other
words
the
penalties
really
are
a
creation
of
the
statute
and
the
statute
which
creates
those
penalties
and
creates
the
lien
for
the
penalties
has
specifically
validated
that.
now,
to
be
sure
in
bankruptcy
again
we
combine
that
57j
disallows
as
we
say
unsecured
claims
but
a
lien
has
that
fundamental
difference
from
an
unsecured
claim.
for
example,
contrast
--
consider
if
you
will,
what
would
happen
if
you
were
to
hold
that
57j
were
to
knock
out
liens
itself,
a
lien
for
penalties?
what
you
would
do
i
think
in
the
first
place
would
create
a
discordance
between
the
secured
creditor
in
possession
and
the
secured
creditor
not
in
possession
when
the
property
is
before
the
bankruptcy
court.
well,
maybe
that's
perfectly
alright,
but
at
least
it'll
create
that
discordance
but
more
importantly
and
this
was
something
that
this
court
expressed
grave
concern
about
in
goggin,
more
important,
you
would
create
or
allow
--
what
i
would
term
in
unseemly
race
between
the
trustee
and
the
lien
holder
in
order
to
gain
possession
of
the
property
and
under
those
circumstances
far
from
aiding
the
unsecured
creditors,
i
should
--
the
very
holding
of
57j
as
a
applicable
--
applicable
to
secured
claims
would
operate
as
a
detriment
to
the
unsecured
creditors
and
i
--
at
this
stage
i
conclude
exactly
what
you
said
in
goggin
in
page
131.
it
would
--
because
it
would
compel
a
lien
holder
to
retain
his
actual
possession
of
the
property
in
order
to
be
sure
of
his
priority
in
payment
of
this
tax
claims.
thus,
the
actual
amount
of
property
which
would
be
available
for
general
distribution
would
be
proportionately
diminished
and
this
is
precisely
the
--
what
you
said
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
whether
or
not
it's
in
possession
or
out
of
possession?
well,
i
suppose
--
no
question
about
it.
if
you
were
to
interpret
it
--
if
you
were
to
interpret
the
bankruptcy
act
to
say
that
regardless
of
where
the
property
was
the
trustee
would
have
the
powers
to
attack
the
property
for
the
penalty.
i
suppose
this
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
if
you
read
into
the
actual
act.
however,
i
really
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
i
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
i
submit
--
naturally
if
you
read
into
the
act
the
intention
of
congress
to
say
that
secured
as
well
as
unsecured
claims
maybe
knocked
down
if
they're
penalties
and
that
the
trustee
may
have
the
power
of
knocking
it
down
whether
the
property
is
in
possession
or
out
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
pardon?
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
there
is
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
there
is
nothing,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
alright.
there's
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
what
i'm
talking
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
a
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
it's
a
--
there
is
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
--
not
as
--
well,
there's
nothing
--
there's
not
a
single
sentence
in
the
bankruptcy
act
which
indicates,
i
suppose
either
for
or
against.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
no
and
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
right
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i
think
--
precise
--
what
we
have
to
do
is
approach
this
problem
from
i
suppose
a
historical
from
--
from
a
historical
perspective
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
we
don't
eliminate
what
congress
said
but
--
but
you
see,
the
thing
is
facts.
my
feeling
is
that
facts
are
entirely
neutral
that
one
must
give
a
slam
to
this
facts
if
--
depending
on
what
you
read
into
it.
i
mean,
what
congress
said
is
not
that
it
is
for
secured
claims.
indeed,
if
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
that's
right,
but
i
mean
--
i
think
you
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
if
we
are
dealing
with
claim
and
natural
meaning,
if
we
go
on
that
ground
itself,
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
(inaudible)
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
supposing
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
alright,
supposing
i
--
thank
you
--
thank
you
mr.
justice
black,
on
your
word
and
say
let's
approach
this
from
a
plain
and
natural
meaning.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right
and
my
--
our
opposition
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
context,
first
of
all
when
you
look
at
the
context,
the
57j
itself,
there
is
not
a
single
–
the
whole
context
of
section
57
and
chapter
6
and
which
chapter
57
deals
generally
almost
exclusively
with
unsecured
claims
and
the
unsecured
portion
of
secured
claims.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
secured
claims.
in
fact,
historically
the
concept
of
provability,
the
concept
of
allowability
only
related
to
unsecured
claims
because
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
it
was
proof
in
allowance
of
claim
is
because
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
i
mean,
i
should
think
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
i
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
but
he
--
if
you
go
back
to
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
the
proof
and
allowance
of
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
the
proof
and
allowance
of
claims
however
has
always
historically
meant
a
proof
and
allowance
of
unsecured
claims.
when
you
discuss
the
concept
of
liens,
you
discuss
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh,
i
can
document
it
in
this
way.
for
example,
originally
secured
creditors
where
never
even
considered
--
the
legislators
never
considered
it,
concerned
themselves
with
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
1803.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
i
could
establish
that
whatever
--
first
of
all,
the
original
act
did
have
--
didn't
--
said
nothing
about
secured
claims,
whatsoever.
the
secured
creditor
was
left
to
his
common
law
remedies
of
it
because
this
was
the
natural
thing.
a
lien
or
property
was
a
charge.
he
had
his
lien
regardless
of
what
happened
to
it.
so
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it
wasn't
the
proper
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
the
bankrupt
--
the
bankruptcy
estate,
it
was
never
a
concerned
--
it
was
never
considered
relating
to
liens.
the
liens
were
to
be
realized
first
and
then
we
dealt
with
the
bankrupt
estate.
and
therefore,
the
concept
of
disallowance
or
allowance
only
concerned
those
claims
which
were
relating
to
the
bankrupt's
estate,
but
because
a
lien
was
a
charge
upon
property,
because
it
--
if
it
was
valid
before,
it
was
--
it
had
to
be
valid
after
even
though
it
passed
through
the
hands
of
the
trustee.
that
was
the
end
of
it.
indeed,
a
similar
concept
was
given
by
this
court
in
the
safer
case
dealing
with
interest
when
the
government
had
its
original
priority
on
taxes,
this
court
in
the
safer
case
said
that
the
priority
for
taxes
was
not
a
claim
on
the
estate
whatsoever.
that
had
to
be
realized.
that
had
to
be
paid
off
before
the
claims
of
the
bankrupt
estate
were
to
be
allowed
or
disallowed
and
if
you
turn
to
the
pages
of
safer,
this
was
made
perfectly
clear
by
this
court.
now
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
this
never
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
57j
--
there
are
--
no,
these
early
acts
only
dealt
with
unsecured
claims
and
it
was
only
at
1898
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it
was
the
--
no,
1898
was
the
first
bankruptcy
act
in
which
57j
found
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
1803,
1843,
1874,
we
point
out,
at
page
20
of
our
brief,
we
point
out
that
in
the
early
acts,
congress
did
indicate
that
secured
claims
should
be
preserved
and
protected
and
the
rights
denies
(inaudible)
should
not
be
impaired.
now
that
doesn't
necessarily
help
our
argument
one
way
or
the
other,
but
it
does
indicate
that
the
congress
has
always
been
aware
of
this
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
that's
quite
true.
our
fundamental
position
--
as
far
as
this
portion
of
the
argument,
i
think
that
there's
no
point
in
prolonging
this
discussion,
because
i
think
the
issue,
the
line
has
been
drawn.
the
government
contends
that
there
is
fundamental
distinction
of
status
between
secured
and
unsecured
claims,
that
if
57j
were
to
apply
to
secure
claims,
there
would
be
created
this
discordance
between
the
lien
holder
in
possession
and
out
of
possession
and
that
the
whole
structure
of
the
act
and
all
concept
of
proof
and
allowance
of
claims
clearly
indicates
that
57j
being
part
of
a
section
dealing
only
with
unsecured
claims
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
indeed.
yes,
they
–
it
goes
all
the
way
to
the
n.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
a
to
n.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right,
that's
right.
for
example,
i'll
quote
in
--
there
are
about
three
or
four
that
deal
with
secured
claims,
but
only
to
the
extent
of
the
unsecured
portions
of
those
claims.
in
other
words,
they
deal
with
secured
creditors.
they
say
that
secured
creditors
may
come
in
and
they
may
file
their
claims
and
so
on.
and
the
priority
is
temporarily
allowed,
for
example,
57e
participate
in
the
proceedings
of
creditors
leading
so
prior
to
determination,
but
shall
be
temporarily
allowed
for
such
sums
only
as
to
the
courts
which
the
court
seemed
to
be
owing
over
and
above
the
value
of
the
securities
and
priorities.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
no,
it's
--
57
does
mention
secured
creditors.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
but
it
mentions
only
in
terms
of
their
--
the
unsecured
portion
of
their
claims.
when
they
come
in,
they
may
file
their
claim,
their
secured
claim
and
realize
that
nevertheless
come
in
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it
would
be
in
a
disadvantage
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right.
there's
no
--
then
it
would
be
no
advantage
seems
to
come
in
at
all.
you
may
as
well
just
keep
the
security
and
try
to
realize
as
much
as
possible
out
of
that
security.
the
reason
why
a
secured
--
really,
the
reason
why
a
secured
creditors
comes
in
the
bankruptcy
at
all
is
because
when
the
trustee
sells
the
property,
he
generally
can
get
more
money
for
it
than
when
the
secured
creditor
sells
it
and
again,
in
goggin
you
pointed
this
out
and
this
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
if
he
has
possession
already
or
what
i
meant
is
--
if
he
has
possession
right,
he
doesn't
have
to
file
a
petition
at
all.
it's
just
--
when
the
--
are
you
talking
about
the
trustee
or
the
secured
creditor?
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh,
yes.
he
must
get
permission
to
sell
the
property
and
then
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
oh,
yes.
well,
if
he
were
out
of
possession,
what
the
--
the
usual
manners
that
he
comes
in,
the
bankruptcy
court
allows
the
trustee
to
realize
the
proceeds
and
then
indeed
57,
g
or
h
i'm
not
sure
which,
deals
with
the
sale
by
the
trustee
of
these
proceeds
in
parceling
out
of
the
liens
and
then
the
unsecured
claims
depending
on
how
much
proceeds
come
to
the
bankruptcy
court.
that's
quite
true.
now
even
if
section
57j
were
to
be
held
to
apply
to
--
not
to
apply
to
secured
creditors.
the
trustee
in
simonson
makes
one
additional
argument,
namely
in
simonson
it
should
be
pointed
out,
the
government
--
the
notice
of
the
government's
lien
was
filed
after
bankruptcy
and
the
trustee
then
makes
the
contention
that
therefore
that
federal
tax
lien
should
be
disallowed
as
to
him
because
the
notice
was
not
filed.
now,
our
argument
is
two-fold.
first
of
all,
we
say
that
section
67b
again
of
this
statute,
only
the
other
provision
of
67b
is
a
complete
answer.
67b
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes,
is
a
complete
answer
to
this
problem
because
67b
says
that
even
if
a
federal
or
state
tax
lien
arises
but
is
not
perfected
before
bankruptcy,
that
lien
nevertheless
maybe
valid
as
against
the
trustee
if
perfected
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
which
creates
it.
now,
what
is
the
statute
that
creates
it?
what
does
it
do?
first
of
all,
it
says
that
the
lien
arises
when
the
assessment
is
made.
that's
section
63,
21
and
63,
22
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
lien
arises
when
assessment
is
made
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
that's
true.
it
doesn't
say,
if
we
read
it,
you
will
see
that
in
the
first
sentence
of
67b,
it
says,
valid
as
against
the
trustee
with
respect
to
federal
and
state
tax
liens
and
as
you
go
to
the
second
sentence,
it
says
it
shall
be
valid
and
we
read
elliptically
as
against
the
trustee.
now,
collier
in
his
analysis
of
this
does
discuss
the
section
and
he
says,
“well,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
as
against
the
trustee,”
but
then
goes
to
say,
“well,
grammatically
speaking,
it
is
elliptical
and
i
suppose
you
could
read
it
that
way.”
the
government
contends
that
this
does
mean
as
against
the
trustee.
that
in
fact
it
has
to
--
and
in
one
second,
i'll
show
why.
so,
that
the
lien
therefore
arises
at
assessment
and
is
perfected
upon
demand
for
payment.
thereafter
notice
of
the
lien
maybe
filed
and
once
perfected
that
lien
relates
back
to
the
time
of
assessment.
this
is
the
normal
law
on
tax
liens.
now,
what
happened
in
the
present
case?
the
lean
arose
at
assessment
about
a
full
month
a
half
before
bankruptcy
and
the
demand
was
made
indeed
10
days
thereafter,
so
the
notice
and
demand
were
made
prior
to
bankruptcy.
then
the
notice,
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
our
lien
was
made
after
bankruptcy
but
this
is
entirely
within
the
scope
of
the
lien
provision
because
then
our
argument
goes
--
the
lien
was
perfected
in
accordance
with
the
statute
which
created
it.
it
related
back
as
of
the
time
of
assessment
which
was
a
month
and
a
half
prior
to
bankruptcy
and
therefore
it
has
to
be
considered
as
against
the
trustee
whose
rights
only
arise
at
the
time
the
petition
for
bankruptcy
is
filed.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
nothing
is
involved
and
indeed
--
if
you
decide
against
the
government
in
the
first
case,
you
needn't
get
to
this
--
you
needn't
get
to
this
argument.
if
you
decide
for
the
government
on
this
case,
you
must
get
to
this
second
issue
and
decide
this
issue
either
for
or
against
the
government
and
it
only
relates
to
the
penalty
in
simonson
because
if
--
as
you'll
note
at
record,
page
7
of
simonson,
the
trustee
paid
the
amount
of
the
taxes
and
the
only
--
the
lien
for
penalties
is
contention
here.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
as
of
the
time
--
as
of
the
time
of
assessment.
it's
been
held
and
you'll
notice
in
our
brief,
we
cite
the
(inaudible)
case
and
indeed
in
the
in
re
fidelity
tube
case
which
was
a
third
circuit
case,
there's
a
discussion
of
this
and
it
again,
virtually
black
letter
law
that
when
a
lien
is
perfected
it
relates
back
as
of
the
time
of
the
assessment
so
that
--
as
against
the
rights
of
the
trustee,
we
maintain
that
under
67b
itself
we
should
take
precedence.
any
other
holding
would
create
a
very
peculiar
situation,
because
what
it
would
do
would
be
to
grant
a
state
tax
lien
which
may
in
fact
be
junior
to
the
government's
federal
tax
lien,
but
nevertheless
give
it
priority
over
the
government,
not
only
over
the
government's
lien,
but
knock
out
the
government's
lien
and
allow
all
the
state
tax
liens
to
be
realized
on
first
prior
to
the
trustees'
rights.
if
the
statutes
which
create
the
state
tax
liens
allow
perfection
prior
--
subsequent
to
bankruptcy.
clearly
it
would
seem
that
congress
did
not
have
this
intention
in
mind.
it
didn't
have
the
intention
of
allowing
the
state
tax
lien
to
come
over
the
federal
tax
lien.
now
our
second
argument
deals
with
the
particular
--
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
under
section
6
--
under
section
70c,
the
judgment
creditor
is
given
the
rights
of
a
--
the
trustees
are
given
the
rights
of
a
judgment
creditor
for
purposes
of
the
tax
lien
statute,
and
since
notice
is
filed
subsequent
to
bankruptcy,
he
should
take
priority
because
the
tax
lien
statute
says
that,
our
tax
lien
is
not
valid
as
against
a
purchaser,
mortgagee,
pledgee
or
judgment
creditor
if
notice
has
not
been
filed.
we
believe
that
this
court's
opinion
in
gilbert
associates
really
the
complete
answer
to
this
problem.
in
other
words,
there
it
said
that
a
judgment
creditor
must
be
one
in
the
usual
conventional
sense
namely
having
a
judgment
of
a
court
of
record
before
it
may
realize
this.
and
every
court
of
appeals
which
has
followed
gilbert
associates
--
which
has
considered
gilbert
associates
in
relationship
to
the
bankruptcy
have
said
that
although
section
70c
gives
the
judgment,
gives
the
trustee
the
rights
of
hypothetical
judicial
lien
creditor,
he's
not
a
judgment
creditor
for
purposes
of
this
statute.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that's
right,
all
the
cases
which
have
followed
gilbert
and
in
relationship
to
trustees
as
--
have
said
so.
now
we
agree
that
gilbert
only
related
the
state
tax
liens
and
the
reasons
why
the
gilbert
case
was
decided
the
way
it
was
may
very
well
be
said
to
relate
to
state
liens
and
the
requirement
of
uniformity.
and
we
also
agree
that
when
it
comes
to
the
concepts
of
uniformity
between
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
tax
lien
statute,
there
is
no
virtually
no
problem.
so
that
on
one
hand,
you
could
say
that
gilbert
associates
under
those
circumstances
would
not
necessarily
apply.
but
we
think
that
the
perfect
answer,
in
face
a
conclusive
proof
that
gilbert
associates
must
apply,
even
though
it
is
a
federal
statute,
was
given
in
--
is
given
in
the
legislative
of
history
of
the
federal
tax
lien
statute
itself.
because
when
--
in
the
1954
code,
when
congress
passed
the
--
when
the
house
version
of
code
was
pending,
the
house
had
a
subsection
c
which
stated
that
the
tax
lien
statute
shall
not
be
extended
to
a
judgment
creditor
who
does
not
have
a
valid
judgment
obtained
in
the
court
of
record.
and
the
house
committee
in
its
report,
we
cite
these
but
we
don't
quote
it
and
that's
why
i
would
like
to
quote
some
of
this
language
now,
because
we
feel
that
it
highlights
really
the
intention
of
congress
there.
that
the
house
committee
in
its
report
explained
that
the
subsection
was
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
here
--
well,
one
should
--
if
the
congress
has
made
its
intention
clear.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
that's
right.
i
mean
one
--
when
congress
directs
itself
to
a
particular
problem,
one
may
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
pardon?
did
it
direct
itself
to
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
in
the
tax
act
statute,
it
had
reference
to
the
bankruptcy
act
when
it
was
discussing
the
survivability
of
the
lien.
i'm
just
about
certain.
it
said
that
protection
of
the
statute
to
categorize
a
person
is
now
denied
protection
under
existing
court
decisions,
should
not
--
that
the
lien
should
not
be
extended
there
and
presumably,
this
had
to
mean
to
gilbert
associates.
but
it
went
on
to
make
it
smoothly
clear,
and
this
is
the
language
which
we
feel
is
very
crucial
here,
it
went
on
to
make
clear
of
that,
particular
persons
shall
not
be
treated
as
judgment
creditors
because
state
or
federal
law,
artificially
provides
or
concedes
such
person's
rights
or
privileges
of
judgment
creditors
or
even
designates
them
as
such
when
they
have
not
actually
obtained
a
judgment
in
the
conventional
sense.
now,
when
that
provision
went
to
the
senate,
the
senate
did
knock
it
out
and
the
question
is
why
did
they
knock
it
out?
they
knocked
it
out
as
unnecessary
because
they
said
that
the
rules
which
it
sets
up
with
respect
to
tax
liens
had
“already
been
developed
under
existing
law
by
judicial
construction.”
and
then
went
on
to
say
as
under
existing
law,
a
person
who
is
in
fact,
a
mortgagee
or
pledgee,
purchaser
our
judgment
creditor
will
be
entitled
as
such
for
the
protection
of
the
statute.
finally
in
the
conference,
the
house
agreed
to
the
deletion
of
subsection
c.
it's
own
subsection
c
only
after
satisfying
itself
that
in
any
event,
the
existing
law
as
to
judicial
liens
under
the
statute
and
i
presume
this
had
to
mean
to
gilbert
associates
case,
would
continue
in
effect
by
the
passage
of
the
present
subsection
c.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
but
congress
read
into
the
tax
lien
statute
the
general
language
of
gilbert
associates
to
mean
that
even
though
the
state
law
--
even
though
federal
law
were
to
give
the
trustee
or
to
give
anyone
the
rights
and
remedies
of
a
judicial
lien
or
a
judgment
creditor,
nevertheless
that
was
not
sufficient
under
6323
because
the
trustee
has
not
received
a
judgment
of
a
court
of
record.
now,
it
is
conceivable
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
it
talked
about
state
or
federal
law
which
artificially
provides
or
concedes
such
persons'
rights.
it
didn't
refer
to
bankruptcy
law
at
such
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
but
the
crucial
thing
--
but
i'd
say
that,
it
couldn't
have
been
clearer
by
implication
that
it
had
to
be
--
because
there's
only
one
statute
in
all
the
federal
enactments
that
do
create
this
type
of
situation
by
which
a
person
who
is
not
a
judgment
creditor
has
nevertheless
given
the
powers
and
rights
of
the
judgment
creditor.
they
had
to
refer
to
this
and
when
they
refer
to
existing
court
decision
and
incidentally,
when
i
say
gilbert
associates
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
no,
that's
right,
but
i
should
point
that
prior
to
the
1954
code
there
were
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
decisions
which
rightly
or
wrongly
had
related
gilbert
associates
to
the
bankruptcy
act
and
those
two
were
the
existing
judicial
construction.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
well,
it
maybe.
all
i
request
in
this
court
is
that
if
you
do
read
the
language
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
i
think
that
the
language
is
perfectly
clear
that
this
is
precisely
with
congress.
at
any
rate,
because
as
we
feel
that
liens
are
valid
and
timely,
the
judgments
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it
wouldn't
have
to,
no.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
it
was
denied.
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
the
other
side
as
he
said
had
petitioned
and
it
was
denied.
that
was
previous
i
think
to
this
--
mr.
richard
j.
medalie
that
did
involve
the
second
point,
but
that
was
denied.
