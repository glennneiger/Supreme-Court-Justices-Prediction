justice
felix
frankfurter
february
16th,
excuse
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
just
say
--
the
last
page
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
november
23?
justice
felix
frankfurter
september
27,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
september
27,
19
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
september
27.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
could
you,
may
i
ask
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
to
--
i'm
right
in
inferring
that
there
is
no
improprieties
suggested
by
you
regarding
the
lateness
of
the
government's
coming
forward
with
the
suggestion
that
the
--
regarding
that
the
destruction
are
non-existing
to
destruction
of
the
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
whether
you
--
whether
you
make
the
point
not
of
dilatoriness
or
lateness
but
that
--
that
there's
something
reprehensible
in
this
late
disclosure
for
what
the
government
concedes
to
be
either
the
truth
or
the
--
or
circumstances
indicating
that
the
subject
matter
that
are
ought
to
be
canvassed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
--
i'm
not
questioning
that
--
that
you
have
a
right
to
take
a
legal
position
because
of
that.
but
it
may
make
a
difference
at
least
to
me
whether
the
lateness
that
the
government
only
now
comes
forward
in
itself
to
your
mind
has
implications
of
--
of
whatever
it
is,
misconduct,
i
think
justice
harlan
asked
you
about,
misconduct
or
negligence
or
dilatoriness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
not
be
irrelevant,
i
just
want
to
know
what
you're
position
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
government
--
is
the
government
contravening
the
question
that
justice
har
--
black
put
to
you,
namely
if
it
had
--
if
--
that
if
there
was
destruction
of
documents
usable
for
whatever
purpose
in
a
case
whether
for
substantive
uses
as
bearing
on
either
proving
or
disproving
some
relevant
issue
or
to
discredit
a
witness,
i
don't
care
which,
that
the
fact
of
destruction
of
the
document
in
itself
is
a
proper
consideration
for
the
jury
as
bearing
upon
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
because
it
bears
upon
behavior
of
one
party
or
the
other
with
reference
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
raised
that
point?
have
you
raised
the
point
regarding
which
in
your
briefs,
i
haven't
looked
that
and
i
haven't
looked
the
briefs
of
the
either
side.
have
you
raised
the
question
that
justice
harlan
or
justice
black
interrogated
you
on,
namely
the
--
the
allowable
inferences
drawable
by
a
jury
because
of
the
destruction
of
documents
that
are
usable
in
a
trial,
i
don't
care
for
what
purposes
so
long
as
relevantly
usable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
is
it
fair
to
say
that
we
haven't
--
this
court
has
not
before
it
either
to
the
verbatim
printing
of
the
documents
which
have
been
destroyed
evidently
or
a
statement
as
to
what
they
contain,
can
this
court,
on
the
agreement
between
the
parties
of
the
concession
of
one
other
parties,
tell
the
subject
matter
contained
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
documents
in
controversy,
have
i
made
my
question
clear?
can
we
tell,
like
of
either
of
the
whole
of
statement
or
what
is
in
the
documents
or
concessions
to
what
they
--
is
in
them
or
what
purpose
they
may
have
served
the
defendant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
next
question
i
want
to
know
is
there
agreement
is
--
can
we
tell
from
this
record
the
circumstances
of
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
the
documents
called
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
--
let
me
--
i
want
to
ask
a
final
question
but
to
make
clear
the
basis
of
it.
if
i
understood
your
answers
to
--
to
a
question
as
to
--
of
mine,
we
cannot,
from
this
record,
know
what
the
subject
matter
or
the
contents
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
documents
that
you've
called
for,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
know
the
circumstances
under
which
the
content
of
the
document
was
derived,
the
question
that
justice
stewart
asked
a
little
while
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
whether
they
do
or
do
not
fall
within
3500
or
rather
we
have
no
basis
for
judging
that,
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
an
--
that's
an
answer
that
you
--
that
you
say
we
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
meet
your
claim
that
you
ask
for
documents
not
produced
by
the
government
and
not
accounted
for
by
saying
they
do
not
exist,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
have
the
relevance
which
we
say
come
within
section
3500
and
which
you
further
say
are
relevant
to
your
right
and
i
should
say
almost
duty
to
cross-examine
the
credibility
of
a
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
(inaudible)
about
it
but
what
if
they
come
within
3500?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
can
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
pardon
me,
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
think
you
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rothstein
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
what
justice
black
read,
on
the
basis
of
what
he
read,
can
you
say
--
why
do
you
say
they
couldn't
be
personal
notes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
denying
it.
i
just
want
to
know
why
you
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
personal
notes
in
the
sense
of
section
3500
doesn't
mean
that
it
has
to
--
that
he's
on
a
joyride.
justice
felix
frankfurter
personal
notes
in
that
sense
mean
the
notes
he
took
place
purposes
that
are
not
to
be
attributed
under
section
3500
to
the
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
very
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
no
more
than
justice
stewart
inquired
of
a
little
while
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
that
there
isn't
a
basis
for
cross-examination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out
is,
i'm
in
the
dark,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
whether
you
say
the
record
substantiate
of
a
concession
by
the
government
that
we
have
here
the
non-production
of
documents
which
incontrovertibly
fall
within
section
3500.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
want
to
clarify
this.
suppose
there'd
been
merely
an
account,
account
for
affiliation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
you
have
grounds
to
complain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that's
the
very
(inaudible)
what
i
get
out
of
your
statement
is
that
the
charge
is
--
is
insupportable
--
unsupportable
because
the
jury
did
not
get
adequate
guidance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
what
--
what
the
---
it's
so
cloudy
and
so
confused
that
the
jury
wasn't
properly
guided
that
it
should
be,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
on
your
theory
of
the
equation,
not
under
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
the
concession
of
the
government
is
immaterial,
from
your
point
of
view,
they
claim
that
the
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
got
more
than
you
were
entitled
to.
you
challenge
that
because
you
say
what
you
are
entitled
to
was
a
clear
guiding
charging
and
you
didn't
get
that
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
whether
it
is
more
or
less,
it
wasn't
enough
because
it
didn't
guide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
stating
--
calling
attention
to
the
specific
language
that
you
think
is
so
cloudy
that
the
jury
even
of
conscience
of
intelligent
jury
wouldn't
know
what
--
had
to
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
think
that's
a
good
defense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
pollitt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i'm
very
sympathetic
to
claims
of
unclear
charges
and
that
they
fail
in
the
most
essential
thing
from
my
point
of
view
is
the
jury
and
--
and
the
effectiveness
in
the
jury
trial,
namely
proper
guidance
from
the
trial
judge
because
you've
concerned
yourself
with
this
problem.
have
you
--
what
--
what
decisions
are
there
of
this
court
in
which
we
reverse
convictions
because
the
charges
are
too
muddy
and
too
cloudy
into
one
guidance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least,
i
know
that
case.
i
happen
to
know
that
case.
that
is
a
very
--
that
was
a
very
specific
thing.
in
there,
there
was
a
charge
--
well
alright,
i
accept
that.
any
other
that
you
know
of?
that
was
a
--
that
was
a
flagrant
case
where
the
jury
had
been
out
a
long
time
and
then
they
were
called
back
and
the
final
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
impact
of
the
court's
charge
was
all
muddy
when
he
said,
“no
juries
could
understand
what
they
were
talking
about”.
any
others?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
we've
been
very
nitwit
but
merit
in
courts
had
been
very
relaxed
in
enforcing
what
i
regard
as
a
prerequisite
of
effective
juries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
when
the
question
is
raised
as
you
raise
it
now,
the
question
as
i
understand
that
you're
raising
is,
never
mind
how
favorable
it
was,
it
wasn't
favorable
because
it
didn't
give
the
jury
proper
guidance
particularly
in
the
field
of
prosecution
where
guidance
is
most
essential.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
an
inconsistency?
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
tell
the
appellant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
tell
a
jury
it
isn't
conclusive
but
you
may
consider
it.
i
suppose
that's
start
--
that's
a
start
factor
of
--
of
almost
any
litigation.
the
way
you
got
incompetent
--
way
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
interfering
of
events
or
occurrences
or
so
on
that
you
--
that
you
may
use
it
but
it
isn't
the
last
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
deduction
i
draw
from
your
statement,
is
it
--
one
has
to
read
the
whole
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
we
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
there
in
the
record
which
justified
the
court
in
making
from
charging
that
recognition
by
the
parties
that
he
was
a
member,
was
that
just
taken
out
of
the
blue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
--
my
question
was
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
was,
what
was
there
before
the
juries
which
justify
the
court
in
saying,
"recognition
charge
is
ought
to
be
abstract”,
one
of
the
great
vices
of
american
charges
so
that
they
are
most
of
them
just
mumbo
jumbo
abstractions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
was
there
in
the
record
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
that
isn't
objective
and
you
got
more
than
a
mere
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
appealing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
a
charge
is
directed
to
what
the
jury
had
heard
the
day
before
or
the
two
days
before,
charges
on
the
abstraction,
their
comments
on
what
took
place
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you,
may
i
trouble
you
at
the
outset,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
the
environment
of
the
circumstances
in
which
this
question
arose
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
not
have
us
started,
at
least,
haven't
started
in
its
brief,
what
preceded
this
that
was
relevant
to
--
to
understanding
the
full
context
of
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
made
by
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
motion
to
produce
all
the
documents
of
those
two
witnesses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
relation
to
the
defendants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
reading
that
again,
what
the
counsel
urge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
not
the
full
text
but
what
you
regarded
as
the
crucial
demands?
you
see
we
haven't
got
printed
record
of
these
statements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
previously
defined,
does
that
the
one
that
were
deemed
too
broad?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
as
previously
defined,
it
made
in
this
motion
or
in
a
prior
motion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
was
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
cutting
through
all
the
ticket
of
words?
what
it
is
regarding
the
disbursements
made
by
the
government
to
an
informing
witness?
what
it
is
that
the
--
that
the
defendants
asked
and
that
the
government
was
ready
to
give
and
what
he
receives
for
duty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
total
of,
as
the
chief
justice
just
brought
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
itemized?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
bulk
item,
bulk
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
it
the
defendants
wanted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
controversy
or
any
overt
controversy
between
the
government
and
the
defendant
that
the
disclosures
that
the
government
was
ready
to
make
as
to
the
moneys
it
paid
at
the
informers,
both
for
salary
and
for
expenses
differed
from
that
for
which
receipts
were
obtained?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
suggested
by
the
defendant,
did
they
call
into
question
the
--
the
truthfulness,
of
the
completeness
of
the
government
readiness,
the
figures
that
the
government
are
ready
to
give
or
did
give?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
the
controversy
about
just
whether
they
were
in
fact
receipts
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
deposited
with
the
f.b.i.
or
some
other
agency
for
the
moneys
which
in
a
month
the
government
disclosed,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
government
--
did
the
government
deny
such
hypothesis
that
the
chief
justice
put
to
you?did
the
government
say
that
the
receipts
are
just
as
much
in
the
large
total
as
the
figures
he
had
given
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
you
can't
say
it's
right
because
i'm
asking
a
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
a
minute
ago,
mr.
maroney,
that
the
--
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
for
the
production
of
these
receipts,
you
don't
know
for
what
reason.
now,
i
suppose
the
reason
you
--
the
reason
you
asked
this
court
to
send
it
now
back
is
because
that
certainly
because
its
an
easy
assumption
that
he
might
have
ruled
otherwise
had
he
known
that
9
out
of
123,
but
you
said
9
out
of
--
and
i
don't
question
the
figures
before
us,
that
9
out
of
123
receipts
did
particularize.
and
it's
the
most
plausible
assume
that
--
not
assumption
but
most
plausible
consideration
that
he
might
say,
“well,
i
know
bibliophiles
who
collected
a
manuscript,
as
a
rule
where
there
are
some
manuscripts
get
some
more”.
and
so,
if
there
are
nine
and
these
were
overlooked
in
the
first
call,
well
how
do
you
know
of
more
careful
pseudonym
might
deduce
small
or
what
you
call
cryptic
disclosures
might
--
this
defendant
counsel
might
find
cryptic
--
some
cryptic
signs
on
their
receipts,
they're
not
suggesting
that.
now
in
relation
to
that
since
we're
dealing
here
with
a
--
with
a
trial
in
the
federal
court
with
all
the
so-called
"supervisory
authority"
we
are
at
to
meet
the
irrelevant
to
inquire.
how
do
you
--
how
does
it
come
about
that
such
an
error
was
made?
is
it
that
--
well,
you
have,
in
view
with
a
lot
of
documents
that
out
of
the
district.
would
the
district
attorney
phone
down
and
probably
or
write
to
the
f.b.i.
and
slipped
the
general's
office
(inaudible)
the
criminal
division
whatever
it
is
and
search
would
be
made
here
and
they
would
then
be
advised,
can
u.s.
attorney
would
have
a
right
to
rely
on
that?
could
you
shed
some
light
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
these
things
happen
apart
from
the
facts
of
human
(inaudible)
explains
a
lot
in
this
world?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
receipts
--
of
the
receipts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
that
could
be
at
some
point
by
somebody,
reference
to
the
documents
deposited
in
washington,
isn't
that
right?
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
they're
kept
in
the
field
office,
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
many
are
somewhere
these
are
deposited
and
u.s.
attorneys
and
his
assistants
must've
conferred
with
the
responsible
person
in
charge
of
these
documents,
isn't
that
right?
well,
if
not
elucidating.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
finish
to
this
mr.
maroney,
he
would
ask
a
field
office
to
prepare
these
and
fit
you
as
you
said
a
minute
ago,
the
attorneys
would
regard
this
as
peripheral,
he
wouldn't
actually
say,
"let
me
see
all
these
receipts,
may
it
be
deposited
in
the
field
office,"
and
he
probably
would
have
some
verbal
or
telephonic
exchange
with
the
field
office
and
say
what
of
--
what
do
these
receipts
show
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
way
the
thing
would
happen
and
the
field
officer
would
tell
him,
"they
just
show
the
amounts”.
and
he
may
have
gone
through
--
i'm
speculating
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
may
have
gone
through
20
and
30
and
saw
nothing
but
the
totals
and
therefore
assume
the
other
hundred
had
the
same
total,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
chronologically
for
that?
you
mean,
whoever
went
through
in
these
receipts
went
through
a
hundred
and
whatever
nine
(inaudible)
--
114
and
calmed
down
and
sort
of
got
tired
and
stopped,
(inaudible)
in
chronological
or
in
physical
order
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
maroney,
i
take
it
you're
just
the
--
the
contents
of
the
f.b.i.
and
what
you
tell
us
about
their
practice,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you've
read,
i
take
it
as
what
they
have
furnished
you
as
your
--
that
it
were
your
instructions
or
your
--
as
their
--
as
the
basis
of
your
response
to
any
question
that
might
be
asked
or
any
argument
that
you
might
make,
is
that
right?
what
you've
read
a
little
while
ago,
10
minutes
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
the
course
of
that,
you
said
the
notes
or
the
practice
of
destroying
the
notes,
would
you
mind
referring
to
that?
it's
on
the
second
page
i
think
if
you
turn
to
page
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
something
about
destroying
notes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
that
--
is
that
--
that
--
about
that,
what
i
asked
you,
does
that
mean
merely
ad
hoc
with
reference
to
this
case
or
does
that
--
is
that
intended,
as
you
understand
it,
as
an
expression
of
what
the
course
of
business
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
course
of
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
other
question
i
want
to
ask
you
is
that
--
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
the
director
of
the
f.b.i.
must
state
as
other
government
official's
statement
that
come
before
appropriations
committee
that
--
that
permitted
appropriations
committee
the
--
the
expenditures
made
for
informant
--
informants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
does
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
true
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
true
of
the
f.b.i.
and
the
c.i.a.,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
addressed
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
government
and
the
president's
private
fund,
so-called
“private
fund”,
the
public
credit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
adopted
by
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
you
at
the
trial,
mr.
pollitt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can
tell
me
--
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
there
a
consecutive
--
was
there
a
charge
by
the
trial
court
other
than
granting
of
request
respectively
by
the
--
by
the
defense
and
the
prosecution?
did
you
make
a
consecutive
charge
with
the
jury
at
anytime?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
part
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
my
question
was
whether
apart
from
submissions
for
request
to
charge,
apart
from
request
to
charge,
some
of
it
he
granted,
some
of
which
he
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
the
things
that
he
granted,
did
the
judge
make
any
--
give
any
charge
of
his
own?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
they
--
none
of
them
originated
from
him,
they
were
all
submitted
by
the
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
nothing
originated
from
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
just
have
charged
about
circumstantial
evidence,
the
next
about
affiliation
and
the
next
about
informer
and
they
wholly
unrelated
tidbits,
pieces
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
but
he
didn't
weave
it
into
one
charge,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
it's
bits
and
pieces,
bits
and
pieces
and
nothing
of
his
own.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
nothing
of
his
own
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
he
did
not
--
he
--
i
seem
to
have
difficulty
in
making
myself
clear.
both
sides
handed
up
request
to
charge.
he
denied
some
and
granted
some.
but
apart
from
the
grants
that
he
made,
nothing
originated
with
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
that's
the
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
been
requested
and
i
grant
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
be
clear
about
this
because
the
document
that
is
on
file
with
this
court
contains
no
consecutive
elocution
by
the
judge
to
the
jury.
it
merely
give
respective
bits
that
there
was
submitted
respectively
by
the
--
by
the
prosecution
and
by
the
defense,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
but
just
look
at
the
document.
why
do
you
--
do
we
have
in
your
arms
up
on
a
memory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
--
without
any
relation
of
the
different
parts
to
one
another
except
that
is
they
all
have
to
do
with
the
case.
at
least
that's
the
way
they
appear
in
the
stenographic
minutes.
i
don't
know
what
--
that's
why
i'm
asking
counsel
what
present
--
what
took
place.
