justice
potter
stewart
now,
with
--
were
these
notes
meet
the
definition
of
a
statement
under
the
statute,
the
so-called
“jencks
statute”?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
it
--
is
it
indicated
that
they
were
signed
or
otherwise
adopted
by
the
witness?
justice
potter
stewart
indicated
that
they
were
substantially
verbatim
report?
justice
potter
stewart
verbatim
transcription
of
what
he
said?
justice
potter
stewart
are
those
the
two
tests,
i
--
i
don't
have
the
statute
in
front
of
me
that
those
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
that's
what
i
remember
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
an
important
and
is
an
important
question
here,
isn't
it?
whether
or
not
these
so-called
“personal
notes”
which
a
--
a
characterization
with
which
i
understand
you
to
disagree,
whether
or
not
these
notes
are
statements
under
the
terms
of
section
3500
of
the
criminal
code.
justice
potter
stewart
substantially
verbatim,
i
think
is
what
it
constitutes.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
your
position
is
it
that
--
that
these
statements
could
have
been
used
as
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
as
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
for
your
--
for
your
use
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
the
counsel
that
for
cross-examination
purposes?
justice
potter
stewart
never
as
evidence,
isn't
it
right?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
anything
in
--
in
the
jencks
case
or
in
the
statute
that
suggest
that?
justice
potter
stewart
or
anything
in
the
rule
--
ordinary
law
of
evidence
that
suggest
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you
--
you
have
the
witness
on
the
stand
and
he's
presumably
of
the
prosecution
or
of
witness
in
you're
cross-examining?
justice
potter
stewart
using
his
prior
inconsistent
statement,
assuming
it
is
inconsistent,
for
the
purposes
of
cross-examination.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
made
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
isn't
the
government's
position
and
perhaps
i'm
mistaken
about
this
that
if
there
was
error,
it
was
an
error
favorable
to
the
defendant.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
the
conviction
was
on
both,
was
in
--
on
each
--
justice
potter
stewart
--on
each?
justice
potter
stewart
and
concurrent
sentences
were
imposed,
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
consecutive?
consecutive
sentences?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
they
were
concurrent?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
they
were
concurrent
were
they
not?
conviction
on
each
account,
concurrent
sentences
imposed,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
government
does
not
certainly
concede
that
there
was
any
error
in
the
charge
as
to
membership,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that
you
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
there
was.
justice
potter
stewart
but
we're
not
talking
about--
justice
potter
stewart
--
government
concede.
justice
potter
stewart
the
portion
has
two
affiliations.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i'll
be
interested
in
hearing
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
he
didn't
--
after
all,
i'm
sure
you'll
agree
that
--
that
item
number
11
which
appears
on
page
39
of
your
brief
and
which
i
gather
counts
in
the
statute,
he
made
that
that
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
his
instructions.
and
he
very
clearly
said
that
the
very
most
that
they
might
take
that
into
consideration,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
as
if
this
--
you
would
agree
that
it's
important
to
read
the
entire
instructions
i'm
sure,
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
particularly
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
comes
before
this
itemized
list
of
12
factors
and
the
paragraph
becomes
afterwards.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
quarrel
at
--
now,
is
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
was
excised?
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
this
issue
was
not
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
count
upon
payment
and
the
witness
ondrejka
would
sign
a
receipt,
would
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
subjected
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
fact
is
not
a
--
prior
to
the
matter
of
records
in
that
stage?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
even
if
related,
it
was
not
prejudicial
error
to
exclude.
justice
potter
stewart
but
these
are
arguments
that
you
want
to
make
to
the
district
court
as
i
understand
it,
which
court,
we
--
well
unlike
us,
have
the
--
all
these
statements
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it's
on
page
24
of
your
brief,
mr.
maroney,
the
first
whole
paragraph,
the
last
couple
of
sentences
i
think
is
(inaudible)
