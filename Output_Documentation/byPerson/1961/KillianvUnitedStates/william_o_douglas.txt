involved.
justice
william
o.
douglas
may
i
ask
at
the
beginning
that
you
can
answer
this
at
any
time
you'd
like.
i
don't
see
a
discussion
in
your
brief
why
we
should
adopt
here
a
different
test
of
membership
under
this
statute
than
the
court
adopted
in
scales
case
that
was
foreshadowed
by
yates
neither
of
which
are
discussed
in
your
brief,
you
can
come
at
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
why
--
what
the
court
was
--
what
it's
paying
in
the
scales
to
indicate
that
your
nominal
membership,
passive
membership
could
not
have
been
within
the
purview
of
the
smith
act
and
there
were
passages
indicating
the
constitutional
overtones
of
--
that
were
present
there
and
i
--
i
wondered
why
--
why
that
isn't
discussed
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
maybe
so
but
i
mean
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
but
it
isn't
obvious.
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
statement
statute
but
it
rests
on
sta
--
stating
that
you're
not
a
member
when
you
are.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it
come
back
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
come
back
to
the
question
of
what
is
membership.
is
it
active?
is
it
passive?
is
it
any
kind?
is
it
nominal?
would
nominal
membership
be
sufficient?
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
a
member
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
a
membership
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
suppose
you're
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
suppose
you
--
suppose
you
had
proof
that
a
membership
--
the
--
the
membership
of
a
particular
individual
was
membership
because
of
his
--
his
belief
in
some
wholly
lawful
activity
of
the
party
and
his
renunciation
of
illegal
activities
in
the
party,
would
that
be
enough?
we
--
we
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
government
had
presented
in
the
scales
case
too,
but
didn't
succeed
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
the
same
party
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
the
same
part
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
it's
the
same
party
though,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
how
about
the
oath
provisions
of
the
--
of
this
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
while
--
the
ones
that
(voice
overlap)
the
one
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
one
that
we
--
one
that
we
have
in
the
douds
case.
you
construe
the
oath
provisions.
it's
not
parallel
to
the
membership
provisions
of
this
act?
these
are
large
questions.
i
don't
think
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
how
about
--
how
about
subdivision
(11)
of
section
5,
"has
indicated
by
word,
action,
conduct,
writing,
a
willingness
to
carry
out
in
any
manner
and
to
any
degree
of
plan,
of
objectives
or
designs"?
justice
william
o.
douglas
those
designs,
objectives
may
not
be
unlawful
that
they
may
have
lawful
objectives,
is
not
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
they
denied
instructions.
the
court
denied
instructions
that
would
have
as
taken
out
of
the
jury's
purview
the
issue
of
nominal
membership
or
passive
membership.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
(voice
overlap)
not
--
not
precisely
the
phraseology
of
scales
but
in
substance
whether
or
not
it
was
--
it
was
active
or
whether
they
were
--
they
merely
adhere
to
lawful
activities.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
--
you
find
it,
i
just
read
that
it's
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
was
that
--
there
was
that
also.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
read
the
record,
they
were
handed
up
of
separate
sheets
and
he
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
he
rejected
some
and
took
others
and
--
and
read
them
all
to
the
jury.
