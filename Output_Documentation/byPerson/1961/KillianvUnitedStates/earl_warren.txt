chief
justice
earl

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
same
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what

chief
justice
earl

--
they
produce?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
sullivan,

chief
justice

everything

chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
schedule,
mr.
maroney,
break
down
the
expenses
as
to
date
and
so
forth
or
did
it
just
say
so
much
--
so
much
for
salary
and
so
much
for
expenses?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
didn't
say
so
many
dollars
expenses
for
--
for
the
day
he
was
visiting
with
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
x
or
y
or
anything
that
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
though
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
though
if
the
--
if
the
witness
had
said
to
the
f.b.i.
agent,
"now,
i
--
i
expended
$25
on
one
day
because
i
was
--
i
was
attending
this
convention
and
$20
the
next
day
because
i
was
in
some
other
place‚Äù.
and
there
was
something
in
the
testim
--
in
his
testimony
that
conflicted
with
the
--
with
that.it
would
be
very
important
to
the
defendant
to
know
that,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
might.
well
it
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
just
got
the
--
if
you
just
got
the
--
the
totals
of
the
items
that
he
gave
to
the
agent,
he
wouldn't
be
getting
very
much,
would
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
maroney,
may
i
ask
this.
according
to
your
latest
brief,
do
i
understand
that
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
it
is
normal
practice
for
an
informer
of
this
kind
to
state
to
an
agent
of
the
f.b.i.
what
his
expenses
are,
itemized
--
itemizing
them
for
him
and
then
the
--
the
agent
turns
that
amount
in
and
immediately
destroys
the
--
the
record
which
would
show
what
the
informer
told
him
were
his
expenses.
do
i
understand
that's
the
normal
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
that's
the
same
as
any
--
any
officer
when
he
gets
a
--
when
he
gets
a
voucher
when
he's
paid
for
either
his
salary
or
his
expenses,
it
comes
in
a
bulk
amount.
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
itemized
but
i
don't
know
of
any
--
any
expenditure
by
any
employee
or
the
officer
of
the
government
that
doesn't
require
some
itemization
to
be
--
that's
retained
by
the
government
as
evidence
of
the
fact
that
--
that
he
actually
made
those
expenditures.
and
i
just
want
to
know
now
if
maybe
their
--
the
way
they
deal
with
undercover
agents
but
i'm
just
asking
you
if
it
is
the
practice
to
--
for
the
agents
to
--
to
ask
them
what
their
expenses
are
and
--
and
for
what
purpose
and
then
when
he
gets
the
information,
destroys
records
immediately
so
there'd
be
no
records
available
in
the
government
of
that
fact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
only
reason
i
asked
you
that
is
because
you
say
according
to
the
regular
factors,
it
was
done
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
so
--
i
so
understood
the
--
your
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
talking
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i'm
not
talking
about
receipts.
i'm
talking
about
the
--
the
information
that
the
government
gets
of
what
his
expenditures
are
and
you
say
that
the
only
evidence
the
government
gets
is
what
he
told
the
agent.
and
then,
after
the
--
the
agent
makes
a
memorandum
of
it
and
turns
the
gross
amount
in,
he
immediately
destroys
the
--
the
information
that
he
got.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
certainly
would
be
some
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
i
was
trying
to
find
out
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
all
i
was
trying
to
find
out,
what
is
the
practice?
you
stated
what
the
practice
was
and
you
stated
that
these
--
these
notes
were
destroyed
in
accordance
with
practice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
yes.
now,
where
--
where
he
does
itemize
it?
is
he
supposed
to
keep
it,
the
agent,
keep
the
--
keep
the
notes?
make
--
the
record
he
makes
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
no,
just
tell
me
the
practice.
i
know
i
don't
--
not
being
(voice
overlap)--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
didn't
your
brief
say
that
this
was
done
in
accordance
with
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
what
--
what
do
you
base
that
on?
just
tell
us
what
you
based
that
statement
on
and
i
won't
go
any
further
with
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
the
period
in
dispute
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
were
those
--
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
period
--
the
period
where
there
was
no
itemization
was
not
in
--
was
not
in
question
here
was
it?
and
the
--
and
the
indictments
say
that
he
was
--
he
was
a
--
a
member
of
the
party
from
such
and
such
a
time
to
such
and
such
a
time
and
wasn't
that
in
the
1950's?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
1952,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
just
one
more
question
and
i
won't
take
anymore
of
your
--
any
more
of
your
time.
but
i
would
like
to
ask
you
if
these
--
if
these
notes
that
were
taken
by
the
agent
itemizing
the
expenses
of
--
of
this
witness
are
the
notes
that
you
referred
to
as
the
personal
notes
of
the
agent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
that
would
make
it
personal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
he
use
--
what
would
he
use
that
information
for?
he'd
use
it
to
pay
the
man,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
--
how
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
why
do
--
why
do
you
classify
that
as
personal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
personal
duties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they're
--
and
they're
made
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they're
made
as
the
basis
for
paying
a
man
government
money,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
come
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
pay
the
money
out
and
destroyed
the
notes
which
left
him
with
no
verification
of
any
kind
as
to
why
he
paid
this
money
to
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
here
that
he
destroyed
the
notes,
the
personal
notes
in
a
normal
course
of
operation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
maroney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pollitt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
maroney,
do
you
--
do
you
agree
with
counsel
that
the
--
that
the
instructions,
as
they
appear
in
their
transcript,
reflect
what
actually
happened?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
that's
all
we
could
answer.
