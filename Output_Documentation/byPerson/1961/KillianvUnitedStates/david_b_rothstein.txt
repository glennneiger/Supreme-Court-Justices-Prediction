mr.
david
b.
rothstein
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
proceeding
comes
on
to
be
heard
upon
the
grant
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
limited
to
two
questions.
the
questions
as
we
conceive
of
them
are
set
forth
in
the
petitioner's
brief
on
page
2.
briefly,
question
number
one
is
whether
it
is
within
the
discretion
of
a
trial
judge
to
excuse
production
of
documents
of
expenditures
made
by
informer
witnesses
a
foundation
for
such
production
having
been
laid
in
accordance
with
title
18
section
3500.
and
the
government
having
offered
in
lieu
thereof
a
schedule
of
amounts
received
or
paid
to
the
witnesses
and
the
dates
of
payments.
second
question
is
whether
jury
instructions
properly
define
membership
and
affiliation
--
membership
in
an
affiliation
to
the
communist
party
because
the
two
questions
lend
themselves,
we
think,
very
nicely
to
a
division
of
argument.
i
propose
to
discuss
the
first
question,
my
associate,
mr.
pollitt,
will
discuss
the
second
question.
the
proceeding,
if
the
court
please,
was
initiated
by
the
filing
of
a
two-count
indictment
in
november
1955
in
the
district
court
seating
in
chicago,
illinois
alleging
a
false
swearing
in
violation
of
title
18
section
1001
by
the
filing
of
a
false
non-communist
affidavit
in
the
chicago
office
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
december
11,
1952.
count
i
alleges
that
the
defendant
was
in
fact
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
count
ii
alleges
that
the
defendant
was
in
fact
affiliated
to
that
party.
as
the
government
suggests
in
its
brief,
section
9
(h)
pursuant
to
which
the
affidavit
was
filed
has
been
repealed
and
a
substitute
bill
enacted
it,
i
think
having
a
similar
purpose
for
which
the
maximum
penalty
at
least
in
terms
of
imprisonment
he
violated
his
one
year.
the
defendant
in
this
proceeding
has
been
convicted
twice.
each
time
he
was
sentenced
to
serve
a
term
of
five
years
upon
the
membership
count
and
three
years
upon
the
affiliation
count
of
the
sentences
to
run
concurrently.
the
first
conviction
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
upon
the
petition
of
the
defendant
for
rehearing,
specifically
upon
the
authority
of
jencks
versus
the
united
states
without
further
comment
by
the
court
of
appeals,
jencks
having
comedown
while
the
appeal
was
pending.
the
second
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
as
we
view
the
record,
the
case
for
the
government
rested
in
a
large
part
upon
the
testimony
of
witnesses,
sullivan
and
ondrejka.
each
was
employed
by
the
government
to
join
the
communist
party
for
the
purpose
of
reporting
their
activities
and
the
activities
of
those
with
whom
they
would
become
associated
therein
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
for
their
service,
each
was
paid
with
a
monthly
salary.
in
addition,
sullivan
received
a
monthly
expense
allowance
and
some
reimbursement.
he
signed
receipts
for
the
moneys
received
by
him
for
the
expense
allowance
salary
and
reimbursement.
ondrejka
reported
his
expenses
to
an
agent
orally,
who
at
the
time,
he
made
the
reports,
made
written
memoranda
of
the
saying.
by
ruling
of
the
trial
court,
the
defendant
at
the
trial
was
precluded
from
inquiring
it
to
the
contents
of
the
receipts
signed
by
sullivan
from
ascertaining
whether
ondrejka
signed
receipts
when
he
was
paid
or
the
contents
of
the
saying.
because
ondrejka
was
the
only
government
witness
who
testified
concerning
defendant's
alleged
connection
with
the
communist
party
from
april
1951
through
august
1953
including
the
affidavit
period,
his
testimony,
we
believe,
was
crucial
to
the
government
--
case
for
the
government.
at
the
trial,
if
the
court
please,
the
defendant
moved
for
production
of
witness
statements.
in
addition,
defendants
specifically
moved
for
its
production
of
statements
of
expenditures
made
by
ondrejka
the
government
agents
orally
and
noted
by
these
agents
at
the
time
and
receipts
if
any,
given
by
the
witness
in
payment
thereof.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
no,
sir.
with
respect
to
sullivan,
the
only
motion
made
was
the
production
of
statements.
the
government
failed
to
produce
the
receipts
signed
by
sullivan
and
with
respect
to
ondrejka,
he'd
offered
only
a
schedule
of
payments
made
to
ondrejka
showing
only
the
dates
of
payment
and
the
amounts
received
as
we
understood
the
government
offer
there
as
we
understand
the
record.
in
the
face
of
the
government
opposition,
the
trial
judge
did
not
order
a
production
of
the
documents.
with
respect
to
ondrejka,
the
government
never
produced
the
receipts
signed
by
sullivan.
it
was
on
this
date
of
the
record
that
we
came
to
this
court.
now,
for
a
number
of
years
as
again
as
we
read
the
record
and
i
think
has
conceded
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
government
attorneys
had
read
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
believe
that
all
of
the
requested
documents
existed
was
specifically
the
documents
requested
with
respect
to
ondrejka
existed.
there
was
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
receipts
signed
by
sullivan
existed
because
they
was
--
they
were
in
the
record.
and
that
the
receipt
signed
by
ondrejka
did
not
itemize
the
expenses
reimbursed.
the
problem
of
their
production
has
been
decided
in
two
courts
upon
these
assumptions.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
the
representation
insofar
as
it
was
made
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
assigned
to
the
case,
who
is
now
by
the
way
and
incidentally
a
district
judge
of
the
united
states,
was
other
than
in
good
faith.
now,
i
confine
my
statement
to
the
attorneys
in
the
case.
and
i
--
and
again,
i
should
add
another
reservation.
i
make
no
statement
with
respect
to
personnel
other
than
the
attorneys
because
i
have
no
factual
basis
upon
in
which
to
base
anything
other
than
to
say
that
the
facts
were
not
disclosed.
am
i
being
clear,
sir?
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
--
i'm
afraid
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
no,
no.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
let
me
try
it
again,
sir.
i
--
i
am
not
suggesting
nor
do
i
intend
to
suggest
that
the
assistant
district
attorney
assigned
to
the
case
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
assigned
to
the
case
did
not
make
the
statements
that
they
made
to
the
court
in
good
faith.
and
i
confine
my
statements
to
exactly
those
two
gentlemen.
the
government
now
concedes
that
the
statement
of
expenditures
written
by
the
agents
from
ondrejka's
oral
reports
could
be
and
that
the
receipts
given
by
sullivan
and
ondrejka
are
statements
within
the
meaning
of
section
3500
of
the
title
18,
i
believe.
in
addition
however,
in
its
brief
file
within
the
past
two
weeks,
the
government
also
states
for
the
first
time
that
the
statements
no
longer
exist,
that
is
to
say
the
memorandum
made
by
the
agents
who
made
them
contempt
--
contemporaneously
with
the
time
they
took
the
oral
statements
from
the
witness
ondrejka.
the
solicitor
general
tells
us
that
he
is
told
that
the
agents
made
handwritten
personal
notes
of
amounts
reported
to
them
by
ondrejka
that
the
notes
where
destroyed
immediately
after
the
receipts
were
prepared
in
the
normal
of
course
of
operations.
hence,
contrary
to
representations
previously
made
for
the
lower
courts,
we
are
know
--
now
told
that
it
--
no,
no,
no.
in
contrary
to
the
representations
previously
made
to
the
lower
courts,
we
are
now
also
told
that
the
receipts
or
at
least
some
of
them
are
itemized
in
the
trial
court,
the
assistant
district
attorney
or
then
assistant
district
attorney
said
that
he
was
under
the
impression
that
the
receipts
were
not
itemized.
and
i
think
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
within
the
past
two
weeks,
sir,
when
they
filed
their
brief.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes,
sir.
it's
in
the
brief.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
it's
on
page
26
of
the
government
brief.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
page
26.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
it
couldn't
have
been,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
a
week
ago,
wednesday
was
when
the
government
brief
was
filed.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
the
gray
copy.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
now,
that's
right.
about
two
weeks
ago.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
in
consequence,
we
are
now
confronted
with
two
new,
we
suggest
and
separate
problems.
one,
the
effect
of
the
destruction
of
the
statements.
two,
the
effect
of
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
order
production
of
the
receipts
in
the
light
of
the
concessions
and
new
disclosures
by
the
government.
it
purported
aid
of
a
solution
to
the
problems
presented
as
we
can
concede
the
problems.
the
government
now
suggests
the
limited
remand
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
trial
court
committed
irreversible
error
by
refusing
to
order
the
production
of
the
receipts,
an
error
for
which
the
government
is
in
part
responsible
and
to
determine
the
fact
as
to
the
destruction
of
the
statements.
we
disagree.
and
our
disagreement
is
predicated
upon
the
following
reasons.
we
assume
that
the
solicitor
general
is
now
accurately
stating
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
destruction
as
told
him
by
others.
this
suppression
of
evidence
by
destruction
however,
may
not
lightly
be
passed
over
by
characterizing
these
notes
as
the
solicitor
general
does
in
his
personal
notes.
we
suggest
that
notes
of
an
interview
made
by
an
investigating
agent
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
and
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
are
not
personal
notes,
they
are
government
records.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
according
to
the
statement
made
in
its
--
in
his
brief
by
the
solicitor
general,
the
notes
were
destroyed
before
jencks
and
that
is
to
say,
immediately
after
the
receipts
were
prepared
and
that
would
be
necessarily
before
jencks.
however,
may
i
suggest,
sir,
that
that
would
not
excuse
to
their
destruction
in
our
view
because
even
before
jencks,
it
seems
to
us
that
a
--
the
government
was
obliged
to
preserve
those
records
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
i
wouldn't
pretend
to
be
able
to
guess
the
reasonable
period
of
time
they
accept
to
suggest
that
the
minimum
time
would
be
the
period
of
--
of
the
statute
of
limitations
during
which
any
person
who
is
mentioned
in
those
notes
and
who
might
possibly
had
convicted
a
--
might
possibly
charged
with
the
commission
of
a
crime
might
have
been
indicted.
because
even
before
jencks,
as
i
understand
the
law,
if
--
on
cross-examination
upon
the
trial
of
such
an
indictment,
a
conflict
could
have
be
developed
in
the
testimony
of
the
witness
where
he
would
then
be
entitled
to
the
production
of
those
documents,
as
i
understand,
gordon
versus
the
united
states.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
investigating
agency
should
unilaterally
decide
that
these
notes
are
no
longer
valuable
or
that
they're
valueless.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
believe
they
would
in
accordance
with
the
representations
made
in
this
brief,
the
brief
we're
talking
about.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
it
is
not
indicated
that
they
were
signed
or
otherwise
adopted
and
is
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
of
the
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i'm
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
that's
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
the
--
it
is
indicated
in
the
government
brief
that
they
are
substantially
verbatim
and
that
the
government
in
its
brief
says
that
they
were
there
after
transcribed
to
typewritten
receipts.
now,
i
don't
know
what
precisely
is
meant
by
that
--
by
transcribed
in
the
government
brief.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
i
believe
they
are.
the
government
concedes
that
they
could
be.
and
according
the
record
made
in
the
trial
court,
the
witness
said
that
he
made
oral
reports
which
were
written
down
by
the
agent
as
he
made
them.
now,
that's
as
far
as
the
record
discloses
the
facts.
based
on
that,
i
--
i
would
suggest
that
they
are.
they
don't
have
to
be,
as
i
understand
the
law,
literal
--
the
literal
verbiage
of
the
agent
but
the
substantial
verb
--
literal
verbiage
of
the
witness
but
the
substantial
verbiage
of
the
witness.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
as
i
suggested,
these
are
government
records
not
personal
notes.
and
i
don't
think
you
can
have
this
kind
of
transmutation
of
a
government
record
by
simply
characterizing
them
as
government
--
as
personal
notes
into
something
other
than
a
government
record.
for
example,
if
the
witness
had
deliberately
overstated
his
expenses
in
his
oral
report
to
the
agent,
he
might
very
well
have
been
charged
with
making
a
false
statement
under
the
very
same
section
for
violation
in
which
the
defendant
before
the
bar
in
this
court
now
stating
his
charge.
he
might
then
demand
the
production
of
those
notes
in
his
own
behalf
if
he
was
so
charged.
i
think
that
the
defendant
in
this
proceeding
is
similarly
entitled
to
make
a
similar
demand.
nor
can
we
understand
that
the
production
of
these
notes
ought
to
be
excused
because
they
were
destroyed
in
the
normal
course
of
operations
and
that's
the
language
in
the
government
brief
on
page
24.
if
they
were
destroyed
as
a
matter
of
departmental
policy,
we
believe,
and
not
as
a
result
of
a
mistake
of
an
office
clerk
there
that
--
then
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
the
defendant
to
inspect
these
documents
is
not
less
substantial
but
only
highlighted.
the
second
circuit
has
--
will
--
recently
held
that
when
a
suppression
of
evidence
is
caused
by
negligence
as
distinguished
through
a
policy
of
conviction
may
not
be
upheld
in
a
consolidated
(inaudible)
case.
the
government
now
asserts
that
even
if
the
receipts
are
statements
then
it
will
argue
in
the
trial
court,
if
limited
remand
the
order,
that
they
were
unrelated
to
the
testimony
of
the
witness
since
they
could
only
be
used
by
the
witness
for
the
purpose
of
testing
the
credibility
of
the
witness
upon
an
issue
collateral
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
assuming
that
i
have
stated
this
part
of
the
government
argument
correctly,
there
were
at
least
several
answers
to
this
assertion
in
our
judgement.
first,
every
time
a
litigant
places
a
witness
upon
the
witness
stand,
we
think
that
he
places
the
whiteness's
credibility
as
a
witness
in
issue
without
more.
second
place,
may
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
credibility
is
very
important.
that
in
a
little
novel
“star
wormwood”
judge
curtis
bok,
if
i
pronounced
his
name
correctly,
it
disperse
the
story
of
a
murder
trial
which
took
place
in
pennsylvania
with
his
own
comments
concerning
the
nature
of
a
trial
in
which
he
said
among
other
things
in
his
comments
that
the
lawyers
stock
and
trade
his
credibility.
but
i
think
perhaps
that's
an
exact
statement
of
the
fact,
credibility
is
important.
and
defendants
are
entitled
in
criminal
emphases
to
test
that
credibility
to
the
--
through
the
use
of
statements
as
defined
in
3500
because
only
the
defense
is
adequately
equipped
to
determine
the
use
that
maybe
made
of
such
statements.
as
we
read
cases,
we
find
that
reviewing
courts
are
gen
--
generally
refused
to
speculate
as
to
whether
such
documents
could
have
been
used
effectively.
prosecutors
it
seems
to
us
should
do
no
less.
furthermore
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
if
i
had
known
that
those
papers
were
destroyed,
i
think
i
would
have
gone
a
lot
further
than
the
trial
court.
i
would've
moved
on
the
basis
of
their
destruction
in
addition
to
other
grounds
that
i
did
move
to
strike
what's
the
testimony
of
the
witness
ondrejka
and
of
course
its
two
and
a
half
years
ago
and
i
try
to
think
through
an
answer
now.
and
i
think
now
since
--
that
i
might
have
stood
right
by
that
motion
assuming
it
was
overruled.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
without
that
by
having
briefs
--
brief
to
subject
sir
and
if
you'll
forgive
an
answer
right
off
the
top
of
my
head,
i
think
that
could
be
shown
in
evidence.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
no.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
the
government
--
no,
the
government
has
asked
--
knows
--
was
asking
that
the
matter
be
sent
back
to
determine
whether
or
not
(a)
the
papers
were
in
fact
destroyed
and
(b)
whether
or
not
we
were
prejudiced
by
the
failure
to
produce
the
receipts.
and
as
i
understand
the
government's
brief,
that's
all
the
government's
asking.
but
i
think
if
i
may
suggest
at
this
point,
they
ask
too
much.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
it
is
our
position
that's
in
this
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
as
evid
--
no
--
no,
pardon
me,
sir.
it's
our
position
that
we're
entitled
to
the
production
of
these
statements
assuming
they
existed.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
for
argument.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
don't
know.
we
might
offer,
it
depends.
i
think
we
have
a
right
to
offer
them
if
we
desired
to.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
think
there
--
i
think
that
the
ordinary
law
of
evidence,
we
may
offer
statements
that
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
certainly,
so
if
the
record's
clear,
we
have
to
identify
what
were
cross-examinee
(inaudible)
so
we
offer
the
statement
of
defendant's
exhibit
1
for
example
for
identification
and
then
we
proceed
to
cross-examine
from
the
statement.
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
would
suggest
again
without
any
brief
to
the
subject
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
--
particularly
that
it
would
be
--
i
could
introduce
those
statements
on
trial
because
certainly
a
demonstrative
piece
of
evidence
is
--
has
a
more
compelling
effect
than
oral
testimony
enhanced
in
personal
injury
cases,
i'm
told
they're
bringing
all
sorts
per
--
purview
of
the
charge
in
maps
and
graphs
and
pictures
and
everything
else.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
the
purpose
in
asking
for
the
statements
was
so
they
would
be
available
to
our
use
to
determine
what
use
we
might
make
of
them.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
in
the
government's
brief,
filed
september
27th.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
just
here
two
weeks
ago,
never
heard
of
it
before.
now,
incidentally
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
all
i
attempted
to
suggest
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
reprehensible
or
not
sir
but
i
think
it
certainly
have
been
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
thought
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
thought
that
mr.
justice
harlan
referred
to
advertent
misstatements
and
i
--
no
such
thought.
i
think
there
was
some
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
government
because
there's
a
lot
of
people
working
for
the
government
to
come
up
with
this
late
page.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
so
far
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
they
have
not
commented
upon
that.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
believe
not,
sir.
but
that
sir
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
we
have
insisted
that
we're
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
the
government
what
--
what
--
when?
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
no,
no.
no,
pardon
me
sir,
i
think
they
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
no
sir.
i
--
i
realized
that
i
was
answering
your
question
wrong.
the
government
has
not
admitted
what
the
contents
of
the
destroyed
documents
are.
but
the
government
has
set
forth
part
of
the
content
of
two
of
the
documents
in
existence
that
is
to
say,
the
government
set
forth
the
content
of
--
of
two
receipts,
a
part
of
one
and
all
of
another
at
least
in
their
brief.
but
the
government
makes
no
statement
as
to
what
this
--
what
was
contained
in
the
destroyed
memoranda.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
think
not,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
we
can
tell
from
this
--
from
the
record
itself?
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
apart
from
the
briefs?
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
from
the
record
itself,
you
cannot
tell
except
to
--
except
to
say
that
the
records
exist.
the
record
--
the
record
itself
indicates
that
the
writ
--
that
the
documents
do
exist.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
now
we
know
that
the
documents
reflect
payments
to
the
witnesses
and
that's
all.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
we
don't
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
i
think
we
have
to
say
that
the
receipts
forward
in
3500
based
on
the
record
made
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
do
say
so,
sir,
that
we
--
that
fact
can
be
determined
from
this
record.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
think
not
as
to
their
receipts,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
that
is
as
i
understand
the
situation,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes,
sir
and
that
they
could
not
be
personal
notes.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
no,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
or
at
least
i
didn't
--
pardon
me.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
at
least
i
didn't
intend
to.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
excuse
me.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
i
--
it's
utterly
inconceivable
to
me
that
an
--
an
agent
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
that's
simply
on
a
basis,
he
demands
--
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
when
he
take
--
when
he
makes
these
notes
and
supposing
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
i
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
--
i
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
--
i
think
i
understand
what
your
honor
is
saying.
but
again
i
say
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
but
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
said
earlier.
supposing
in
the
course
of
this
interview,
the
witness
had
said,
“i
had
spent
$400
on
some
item
for
which
i
seek
reimbursement”
when
in
fact
he
had
spent
$40.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
--
i
believe
it
does,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
the
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
--
the
oral
notes
taken
by
the
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
at
one
with
it,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
there's
nothing
in
the
record
as
such.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
have
to
admit
such
possibility,
sir.
but
of
course,
i'm
in
the
dark
also
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
think
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
again
without
having
to
brief
the
subject,
i
think
not.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
make
one
more
suggestion
and
then
sit
down
in
favor
of
mr.
pollitt.
the
--
finally,
the
procedures
suggested
by
the
government
in
its
brief
are
the
limited
remand
with
an
analysis
of
a
700-page
record
to
square
off
the
denied
statements
with
the
700-page
record
as
--
plus
some
of
the
exhibits
would
place
a
--
would
be
a
torturous
procedure
and
would
place
a
great
--
greater
burden
upon
the
trial
court
than
a
new
trial
particularly
if
i
may
suggest
that
it
may
not
be
important
and
in
fact
it's
maybe
unimportant,
since
the
trial
judge
who
heard
two
of
--
the
trial,
both
trials
is
now
sitting
the
court
of
appeals
permanently
and
it
would
probably
have
to
go
to
a
new
trial
judge
whose
--
before
whom
the
record
was
not
made
and
who
has
not
understand
from
the
cold
face
of
the
record,
some
of
the
nuisances
that
go
into
any
trial.
may
i
--
would
that,
sir,
retire?
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
mr.
chief
justice,
now,
i
just
want
to
summarize
in
a
few
minutes
the
--
what
we
feel
we
could
show
if
the
case
were
to
be
remanded
in
district
court
conducted
a
hearing.
we
think
that
we
show
generally
the
facts
that
have
been
discussed
earlier
with
respect
to
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
any
statements
or
reports
and
in
addition,
the
receipts
themselves
which
we
concede
our
statements
but
which
we
contend
are
too
remote
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
to
be
held
to
relate
to
the
direct
testimony
of
the
witness.
now,
these
receipts
would
only
show
two
things,
most
of
them
would
only
show
amounts
of
money
paid.
the
nine
would
show
amounts
paid
and
in
addition,
certain
itemizations.
now,
the
amounts
paid
on
all
the
receipts
would
be
reflected
and
is
reflected
in
the
schedule
that
the
government
offered
to
produce
and
which
was
refused
by
the
defense.
moreover,
all
the
testimo
--
all
that
would
be
shown
by
these
receipts,
as
to
payments
received,
was
already
in
the
record
in
the
form
of
the
direct
testimony
or
the
cross-examination
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
both
of
whom
had,
as
we
indicated
earlier,
readily
acknowledged
that
they
had
been
paid
for
services
and
expenses
and
they
gave
the
amounts
that
they
had
been
paid.
so
that
the
receipts,
insofar
as
they
reflect
money
received,
could
not
be
further
used
to
impeach
the
impeaching
testimony
already
given
by
the
witnesses.
now,
in
addition,
as
we've
also
indicated,
we
--
we
feel
that
--
that
we
can
show
and
that
there
is
substantial
reason
to
believe
that
the
trial
court
upon
examination
of
the
itemizations
would
agree
that
considering
the
overall
testimony,
considering
the
nature
of
these
receipts
and
the
itemizations
listed,
would
agree
that
the
items
do
not
relate
sufficiently
directly
to
the
matters
testified
about
--
by
the
witness
on
the
--
on
his
direct
examination.
moreover,
even
if
in
the
two
respects
in
which
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief,
at
pages,
and
we've
discussed
them
at
pages
33
and
34,
that
two
or
three
of
the
itemizations
in
these
receipts
might,
in
a
very
general
sense,
be
considered
to
have
related
to
direct
testimony
to
matters
about
which
the
witness
testified.
we
feel
that
there
is
good
ground
for
the
argument
that
any
error,
if
there
was
error,
in
that
turning
these
itemizations
over,
was
harmless
and
that
there
was
no
possible
prejudice
to
the
defendant
in
not
having
had
access
to
these
particular
itemizations.
and
of
course,
the
reason,
primary
reason
for
that
is
that
he
had
the
narrative
reports
that
the
witness
had
furnished
to
the
f.b.i.
concerning
these
very
activities.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes,
sir.
now,
for
those
reasons,
we
think
that
the
court
should
remand
to
the
district
court
so
that
a
full
record
can
be
developed
with
respect
to
these
matters
and
of
course,
the
petitioner
again
as
or
would
have
recourse
in
the
event
of
an
adverse
decision
in
the
district
court
to
the
appellate
process.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
court's
definition
or
instruction
to
the
jury
of
membership,
what
constituted
a
mem
--
membership?
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
you
mean
the
activity
fact?
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
purposes
and
effects
of
the
statute
are
different
and
bring
into
play
different
considerations
on
the
first
amendment.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
but
i
think
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
--
basically,
basically,
the
fundamental
distinction
is
that
under
the
smith
act,
the
--
the
membership
with
the
other
elements
is
the
--
is
a
criminal
offense.
whereas,
this
statute
that
we
have
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
that's
--
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
but
the
statute
itself,
the
statute
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
--
that
a
--
that
a
definition
of
membership
similar
to
that
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
--
do
it
in
no
way
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
--
would
be
the
appropriate
(voice
overlap).
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
i
think
if
he
was
knowing
purposeful
membership
that
would
be
enough
under
the
statute.
it
was
his
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
i
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
that's
right,
sir.
scales
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
yes.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
that's
right,
sir.
and
of
course,
the
statute
does
not
say
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
--
(voice
overlap)
membership
in
the
communist
party.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
the
statute
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
that's
--
that's
right,
sir.
but
the
statute
--
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
impeach
so
far
as
possible
the
communist
party
as
an
organization
from
exercising
influence
in
labor
unions
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
put
it
in
a
position
to
interfere
with
interstate
commerce.
the
statute
is
not
directed
primarily
and
its
purpose
is
not
against
the
individual
member.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
the
oath
provisions,
of
course,
refer
to
an
organization
that
teaches
and
advocates
the
overthrow.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
so
that
you
would
have
to
show
knowledge
one
part
of
the
person.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
the
statute
deals
with
two
things,
membership
and
the
party,
for
our
purposes
anyway,
membership
and
the
party
or
membership
in
an
organization
which
teaches
and
advocates
a
violent
overthrow.
now,
the
congress
found
that
the
communist
party
had
reason
to
find
it.
communist
party
was
of
--
of
such
a
nature
that
it
likely
would
interfere
with
interstate
commerce
through
exercising
its
influence
over
its
members
who
were
union
officers.
that
is
the
--
is
the
legislative
basis
for
the
statute.
in
a
situation
where
you
had
an
organization
which
teaches
and
advocates
the
overthrow
and
--
and
the
member
signing
the
affidavit,
of
course,
it
would
be
a
question
of
proof,
you
would
have
to
show
knowledge
that
the
person
executing
the
affidavit
had
knowledge
that
the
organization
of
which
he
was
a
member
did
teach
and
advocate.
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
so
where
the
communist
party
is
concerned
with
respect
to
section
9
(h).
now,
i
--
i
think
the
problem
that
you
can't
show
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
the
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
the
--
these,
of
course,
are
only
some
of
the
criteria
which
the
court
instructed
the
jury,
can
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
--
or
should
be
taken
into
consideration.
i
don't
think
that
--
i
mean,
many
of
these,
standing
along,
would
not
support
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
the
person
was
a
member
because
he
did
one
of
these
things.
but
these
are
certainly
rational
criteria
to
take
into
consideration
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
of
whether
or
not
an
individual
was
or
was
not
a
member
of
a
particular
organization.
the
fact
that
he
attended
meetings,
the
fact
that
he
was
an
officer,
the
fact
that
he
executed
orders,
the
fact
that
he
submitted
himself
to
discipline
of
the
organization,
all
those
things,
i
think
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
logic,
should
be
taken
into
consideration
by
any
fact
finder
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
particular
defendant
was
a
member
of
the
party.
and
of
course,
i
think
contrary
to
what
has
been
argued
by
--
for
the
petitioners
and
in
certain
respects
by
the
amicus,
the
court
did
not
permit
the
jury
to
conclude
that
membership
was
proved
by
anyone
of
these
elements.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
they
didn't
--
they
didn't,
as
i
understand,
they
didn't
ask
for
that
instruction,
your
honor.
they
asked
for
an
instruction
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
well,
as
i
understand
their
requested
instruction,
it
was.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
it
was
to
the
effect
that
they
wanted
the
court
to
charge
the
jury
that
they
had
to
find
that
he
was
devoted
to
the
unlawful
objectives
of
the
communist
--
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
--
party,
the
teaching
and
advocacy
of
overthrow.
mr.
david
b.
rothstein
and
we
don't
know
the
statute
requires
that,
un
--
under
this
court's
decision
in
douds.
i
think
that
it
--
it
must
be
a
meaningful
knowing
full
membership.
it
can't
be
at
nominal
membership.
i
think
the
(inaudible)
principle
is
probably
more
comparable
to
this
situation
than
is
this
court's
decision
interpreting
the
smith
act
under
scales.
thank
you.
