mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
may
it
please
the
court.
the
trial
court's
instructions
to
the
jury
which
define
membership
and
affiliation
are
set
out
on
page
38
to
40
of
our
brief.
our
first
comment
on
these
instructions
is
that
they
completely
confused
the
two
issues
before
the
jury
whether
or
not
defendant
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
whether
or
not
defendant
had
been
affiliated
to
the
communist
party.
because
the
trial
court
charged
on
page
40
of
our
brief
briefly
stated
affiliation
is
charged
in
the
second
count
of
the
indictment
means
a
relationship
which
is
equivalent
or
equal
to
that
of
membership
in
all
but
name.
now,
the
government
concedes
that
this
is
error.
it
concedes
that
affiliation
and
membership
are
not
the
same
thing.
so
that
as
far
as
we
can
see
this
concession
in
and
out
of
itself
advice
requires
that
there
be
a
reversal.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
as
far
as
the
affiliation
charge
was
concerned,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
--
when
the
government
concedes
that
affiliation
and
membership
are
different
and
the
trial
judge
charged
the
--
the
same
thing
then
i
think
they're
conceding
far
more
than
they
realize.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
the
conviction
was
on
both.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
now,
the
jury
was
in
the
position
and
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
no,
five
years
for
membership,
three
years
for
affiliation.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
concurrent
but
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
(inaudible)
that
point.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes,
sir.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
they
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
no.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
no.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
they
concede
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
--
that
this
portion
of
its
instructions
with
error
and
i
say
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
that
affiliation
and
membership
were
equivalence.
it
occurs
in
the
apportion
as
to
affiliation.
but
i
say
it
doesn't
matter
where
it
occurred
in
that
instruction.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
because
when
the
jury
was
instructed
that
membership
was
equal
to
affiliation
or
rather
than
affiliation
was
equal
to
membership,
they
are
two
sides
but
it's
one
equation.
they
were
also
instructed
the
reverse
that
membership
was
equal
to
affiliation.
so
in
effect,
the
jury
was
given
no
fundamental
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
two
crimes
and
they
could
have
convicted
the
defendant
of
affiliation
on
evidence
and
membership
or
they
could
have
convicted
the
defendant
membership
on
evidence
of
affiliation.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes,
sir.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes,sir.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes,
i
would,
your
honor,
on
the
following
basis
that
this
trial
involved,
what
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult
issue
in
the
criminal
courts,
to
get
a
clear
thinking,
straight
thinking
jury
which
is
the
issues
of
communism.
and
when
the
--
although
the
government
concedes
that
the
charge
may
have
been
erroneous,
the
government
contends
that
it
was
--
we
were
helped
by
it.
apparently
--
and
my
summary
is
they
say
it
was
confused
but
not
confusing.
we
think
that
in
--
that
under
any
event,
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
jury
that
is
not
confused.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
that's
right,
one
minute
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
no,
no,
but
particularly,
it's
--
we
regard
that
affiliation
--
one
minute
the
jury
is
sitting
there.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
it
simplifies
my
arg
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
what
we're
entitled
to
is
the
law.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
right.
our
next
question
in
these
instructions,
if
the
trial
court
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes.
on
page
40
in
the
first
paragraph
of
our
--
of
our
--
of
our
brief,
the
trial
court
charged
the
jury
that
affiliation
was
short
of
membership.
then
the
trial
court,
and
i
must
add
your
honor
in
defense,
the
trial
court
he
had
the
--
this
(inaudible)
suggesting
of
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
that
these
instructions
were
suggested
by
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
then
the
--
two
paragraphs
about
ten
lines
down,
he
charged
them
it
was
the
equivalent
of
membership.
so
you
have,
in
one
breath
he
is
telling
them
they're
short
of
membership
and
the
next
breath,
he's
telling
them
the
same
thing
of
membership.
now,
there's
another
point
on
this.
not
only
that
this
confuse
the
status
of
affiliation
but
the
jury
now
is
confused
as
to
what
is
membership
because
the
guide
that
they
were
given,
the
measuring
stick
turns
out
to
be
a
telescope.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
i
find
that
hard,
your
honor,
but
i'll
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
well,
your
honor,
fundamentally
in
a
two-count
indictment
such
as
this,
the
jury
has
two
statuses
before
them
which
are
--
they
will
inevitably
contrast
and
compare.
that's
why
i
referred
to
the
affiliations
charge
as
--
which
incorporate,
by
the
way
the
definition
of
membership,
that's
why
i
referred
to
the
instruction
on
affiliation
as
a
measuring
stick.
but
the
fact
is
that
this
measuring
stick
which
the
jury
was
bound
to
use
was
the
telescope
going
in
up
and
down
like
this,
short
of
membership,
close
to
membership,
equivalent
to
membership.
and
back
again
because
the
jury
doesn't
forget
everything
they
hear.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
well
yes,
if
they
are
told
that
affiliation
--
that
membership
is
diluted
membership,
i
certainly
it
affect
--
think
it
affects
the
membership
charge,
things
equal
to
the
same
thing
or
equal
to
each
other,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
this
was
in
a
real
sense
of
any
kind
of
guidance
to
the
jury
at
all.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
but
the
one
that
comes
to
mind
i
believe
is
(inaudible)
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
well,
i
believe
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
i
have
none.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
well,
part
of
it
is
inevitable
that
it's
hard
to
reaffirm
error
on
an
appellate
record.
it's
very
rarely
that
we
have
such
a
(inaudible)
and
it
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
well,
your
honor,
i'll
say
on
this
that
a
--
a
trial
with
an
issue
of
communism
differs.
ordinarily,
defendant
in
criminal
trial,
his
counsel,
whether
he
is
guilty
or
innocent,
is
hoping
that
he
can
appeal
to
the
humanitarian
instincts
of
the
jury
and
the
equity
of
the
jury.
and
here
however,
where
this
issue
is
involved,
we
have
to
rely
on
clear
thinking
because
if
it
gets
muddled,
all
the
prejudices
of
the
community
come
pouring
in.
turning
briefly
to
the
definition
of
membership,
we
have
two
principle
of
objection
--
two
principal
objections
to
this.
one
is
the
indicia
which
the
trial
court
gave
the
jury
as
to
memberships.
we
maintain
that
these
indicia
which
are
taken
from
section
5
of
the
communist
control
act
of
1954,
that
this
indicia
set
forth
in
38
--
page
38
and
39
our
brief,
open
the
door
to
guilt
by
association,
the
whole
doctrine
of
parallelism,
and
a
doctrine
which
i
consider
even
more
evil,
the
doctrine
that
because
an
act
made
in
the
opinion
of
the
jurors
have
a
tendency
to
advance
communism.
therefore,
the
defendant
is
a
communist.
so,
most
particularly,
you
honors,
these
comes
from
indicia
number
11
whether
or
not
the
defendant
has
indicated
any
--
to
any
manner,
there
is
a
nice
precise
instruction
to
give
the
jury,
and
to
any
degree,
a
willingness
to
develop
or
advance
the
objectives,
not
the
communist
party,
but
the
objectives
of
the
communist
party.
in
other
words,
if
the
communist
party
is
for
public
school
integration
for
whatever
reason
and
the
defendant
is
for
public
school
integration
and
a
jury
man
is
against
public
school
integration
and
thinks
that
the
communist
advised
to
support
our
traditional
american
principles.
then
by
those
facts,
the
jury
man
is
permitted
to
derive
that
the
defendant
is
a
communist.
now,
i
say
that
this
is
a
--
an
invalid
inference
and
the
trial
court
had
no
right
to
permit
the
jury
by
the
instructions
to
make
such
an
inference.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
that's
right,
they
said
--
all
he
said
one
isolated
act,
isolated
act.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
of
course,
i
would.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
well,
in
paragraph
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes,
and
i
think
the
paragraph
becomes
before
and
the
paragraph
become
--
after
it,
terrible.
because
he
told
them
that
although
isolated
acts
weren't
conclusive,
they
could
be
used
at
some
evidence.
so
then
you
have
the
whole
question
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
it's
--
it's
a
practical
inconsistency
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
--
your
honor
when
you're
dealing
with
the
jury.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
well,
i
--
you
can
say,
you
can
examine
all
the
evidence
to
which
is
the
normal
duty
of
a
juror.
i
say
by
emphasizing
to
the
jury
that
they
could
pick
and
choose
some
of
these
evidences
as
--
even
if
isolated,
even
if
isolated
as
evidence
of
guilt
that
the
judge
--
particularly,
in
the
circumstances
of
that
instruction.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes,
your
honor,
and
what
i
haven't
given
you
in
my
brief,
i
am
sure
that
the
government
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
--
has
given
to
in
theirs.
one
more
point,
and
then
i'll
try
to
reserve
some
time,
which
is
--
that
the
definition
of
membership
in
a
communist
party
was
couched,
your
honors,
as
a
purely
subjective
relationship.
it's
described
as
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
individual
that
belong
to
the
party.
and
a
recognition
by
the
party
that
he
is
a
member
with
no
requirements
of
any
external
acts
of
belonging.
in
other
words,
the
jury
was
directed
to
inquire
solely
into
a
state
of
mind.
and
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief
that
this
was
a
subjective
definition.
and
they
--
well,
first
of
all,
at
the
subjective
definition,
as
showing
the
required
--
element
for
mutuality
which
every
membership
has,
its
deficient
because
even
if
the
person
desired
to
be
a
member,
then
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
have
achieved
a
state
of
mutuality
until
he
was
informed
or
knew
that
the
communist
party
recognized
him
as
a
member.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
no,
we
submit
it's
this
form
--
it's
a
form
of
instruction
which
is
submitted
by
the
government
in
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
i'm
sorry.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
there
was
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
there
was
some
evidence
in
the
record
your
honor
of
acts
of
membership
at
one
time
or
another.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
(voice
overlap)
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
as
far
as
the
evidence
but
the
jury
doesn't
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
if
you
have
a
purely
subjective
definition
and
we
have
the
same
problem
but
we
do
with
condition
number
11.
again,
you're
not
tying
the
thing
down
in
time
and
space
here,
constructing
the
sort
of
can't
be
in
the
thing
in
itself,
and
the
jury
is
left
completely
free
to
attach
any
factual
objective
circumstances
to
membership,
which
as
i
said
before
in
the
circumstances
of
today's
world,
it
means
you
open
the
door
to
a
verdict
based
on
prejudice
and
hypothesis.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
no,
i
wasn't,
your
honor.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
i
know
this
record
are
used
to
pretty
well
before
i
stopped
there.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
no,
the
various
request
for
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
--
but
there
was
no
--
i
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
i
had
to
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
apart
from
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
i
think
it
would
be
a
fair
statement
that
outside
of
some
of
the
foreign
books
of
charges,
instructions
that
concur
at
every
charge
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
i
believe
so.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
i'm
informed,
that's
correct.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
it's
a
reasonably
disjointed
charge,
your
honor.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
it
appeared
to
me
that
reading
it
in
the
record
that
it
was
--
is
disjointly
charged.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
well
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
that's
--
that's
not
quite
fair,
nothing
of
his
own
composition.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
the
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
nothing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
it's
in
the
minutes.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
past
the
request
to
charge.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
well
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
well,
it
appears
--
it
appears
that
he
would
read
the
following
charge
was
submitted
by
--
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
yes,
it
was
requested
and
i
grant
it.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
i'm
informed
that's
not
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
basil
r.
pollitt
with
brief
reference
to
section
--
to
number
11
of
the
indicia
which
we
used
in
argument
to
highlight
a
pervading
error
of
all
the
indicia,
i'd
simply
like
to
say
in
response
to
the
government's
argument
that
it's
my
understanding
of
the
stromberg
case,
the
herndon
case
and
the
winters
case
that
when
first
amendment
--
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
defendant
maybe
entrenched
upon,
the
question
is
not
whether
or
not
there
is
evidence
which
supports
the
verdict
but
whether
or
not
under
the
instructions,
the
jury
could
have
rested
its
verdict
on
those
first
amendment
rights,
which
i
think
is
the
case
here.
turning
briefly
to
the
question
of
section
9
(h),
the
purpose
and
the
meaning
of
membership
in
that
section,
the
forepart
of
the
oath
seems
on
it's
face
provide
for
guilt
by
association
and
that
was
argued
before
your
honors
at
one
time.
and
to
violate
the
doctrine
that
guilt
is
personal
because
members,
all
members
of
the
communist
party
seemed
to
be
denominated.
but
as
i
read
the
opinion,
the
various
opinions
in
douds,
if
the
oath
is
to
be
upheld
at
all,
it
can
only
be
upheld
because
the
kind
of
membership
and
the
kind
of
affiliation
involved
involves
a
personal
commitment
to
the
political
strike.
that
was
what
we
ask
the
court
to
give
and
that
was
refused
and
we
submit
that
the
definition
of
membership
and
i
might
add
the
definition
of
affiliation,
both
of
which
fall
short
of
that
personal
commitment.
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
don't
mean
personal
--
i
mean
personal
and
organizational
commitment,
organizational
involvement
which
means
that
personal
commitment.
and
if
it
fall
short
of
that,
it
doesn't
meet
the
standards
laid
down
by
any
of
the
six
justices
on
this
court
who
voted
to
uphold
the
forepart
of
the
oath.
turning
now
to
the
notes,
the
memoranda
of
which
were
destroyed,
first
of
all,
we'd
like
to
clarify
any
doubts
that
maybe
about
--
as
to
our
position.
this
was
evidence.
this
was
produceable
evidence
before
jencks,
produceable
evidence
after
jencks.
in
the
argument
of
(inaudible)
which
requested
in
your
opinion,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
the
one,
the
government
conceded
that
we
could,
at
all
times,
have
called
the
f.b.i.
agent
who
took
these
memoranda.
and
since
these
memoranda
were
made
in
the
regular
course
of
business,
it's
his
duty
and
his
practice
to
make
such
memoranda.
we
could
have
subpoenaed
those
memoranda.
so
that
it
was
evidence
that
the
government
destroy
even
before
jencks.
of
course,
under
section
3500,
the
government
concedes
that
these
notes
could,
these
memoranda
could
have
been
within
this
section.
and
once
that
concession
is
made,
under
the
campbell
case
decided
last
term,
if
those
notes
had
existed,
it
would've
been
the
duty
of
a
trial
judge
to
have
--
to
conduct
a
judicial
inquiry
into
whether
or
not
they
can
within
the
scope
of
section
3500.
so
that
what
the
government
destroyed
here
was
evidence
whether
it
was
before
or
after
the
jencks
decision,
and
by
the
way
your
honors,
we
raised
this
position
before
jencks.
this
was
not
afore
to
in
this
alliance
--
reliance.
we
insisted
from
the
word
"go"
in
his
first
trial
that
we
were
entitled
to
un-break
his
memoranda.
so
that
what
the
government
has
done
here
is
destroy
and
the
police
agency
is
to
destroy
potential
evidence.
our
position
is
very
simple,
they
have
no
rights
or
to
do.
