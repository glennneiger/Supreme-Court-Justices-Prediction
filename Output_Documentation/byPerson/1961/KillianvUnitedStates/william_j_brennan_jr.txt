j.
brennan,

and
that
is
not
the
fact
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
the
government
however,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
now
concedes
that
for
the
purposes
of
production
of
the
statute,
this
form
of
receipt
is
a
statement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
irrelevant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
understood
it.
and
the
reason
you
suggest
sending
it
back
for
a
hearing
before
the
district
judge,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
is
that
you
want
the
opportunity
to
show
that
while
these
are
statements
within
the
statute,
they
are
not
related
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
witnesses'
testimony
and
for
that
reason
and
not
for
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
isn't
as
simple
as
that
mr.
--
just
--
just
(inaudible)
that
receipts
of
the
kind
that
you
illustrate
in
that
but
might
be
have
a
very
important
bearing
on
the
whereabouts
of
the
government
witness
on
a
particular
day
when
he
says
it
was
on
a
certain
place
that's
following
about
a
certain
thing.
and
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand
why
even
if
that
was
the
procedure
which
kept
the
originals
from
the
--
whoever
tried
the
case,
was
it
why
something
wasn't
done
about
it?
why
it
was
before
the
court
of
appeals?
certainly,
you
--
you
had
to
know
this
issue
was
going
to
be
before
the
court
of
appeals.
