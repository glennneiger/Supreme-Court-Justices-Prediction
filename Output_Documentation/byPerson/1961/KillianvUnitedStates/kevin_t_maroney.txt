mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
just
to
preliminarily
take
three
or
four
minutes
to
outline
how
the
general
production
of
document
problem
was
handled
at
the
trial.
three
witnesses
testified
on
behalf
of
the
government
concerning
the
petitioners'
membership
in
the
communist
party.
two
of
those
witnesses
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
the
witnesses,
sullivan
and
ondrejka,
both
concluded
the
direct
examination,
motions
were
made
for
production
of
all
statements.
in
those
motions,
there
were
several
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
made
by
the
defense.
there
were
several
such
motions.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
all
the
statements.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
motions
were
overly
broad
as
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
points
out
in
its
opinion.
they
took
the
position
that
they
were
entitled
to
all
statements
made
by
the
witnesses
to
the
f.b.i.
or
to
any
government
agency
during
the
period
covered
by
the
testimony
of
those
particular
witnesses.
moreover,
they
requested
at
the
trial
court
to
turn
over
all
such
statements
to
the
defense
on
excised.
the
trial
court
rather
than
grant
such
a
broad
motion,
order
that
the
government
turnover
to
the
defense
all
statements
which
have
anything
to
do
with
their
direct
testimony
and
that
was
done.
i
think
we
can
limit
our
discussion
primarily
to
the
witness
ondrejka
because
i
think
this
--
will
be
apparent
from
my
discussion
that
whatever
disposition
is
made
by
the
court
as
to
the
situation
with
respect
to
ondrejka
will
also
control
the
situation
with
respect
to
sullivan.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
they
--
they
have
slight
variances,
your
honor.
for
example,
with
respect
to
sullivan,
there
was
no
motion
specifically
made
for
the
production
of
his
receipts
whereas
with
respect
to
ondrejka,
there
was
a
specific
motion
for
production
of
the
receipts.
at
the
conclusion
of
sullivan's
direct
testimony
and
during
cross-examination
on
three
different
occasions,
they
moved
generally
for
the
production
of
all
statements
that
he
had
made
to
the
f.b.i.
for
the
period
covered
by
his
testimony.
the
trial
court
however,
ordered
the
government
to
produce
all
statements
which
have
anything
to
do
with
his
direct
testimony.
now,
with
res
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
now,
with
respect
to
ondrejka
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
government
--
they
did
produce,
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
statements
which
related
to
the
direct
testimony.
and
with
respect
to
ondrejka
at
the
conclusion
of
his
direct
examination
and
upon
order
of
the
court,
the
government
produced
24
statements
--
reports
that
he
had
made
to
the
f.b.i.
concerning
the
activities
about
which
he
had
testified
on
direct
examination.
those
statements,
all
24
of
them
were
submitted
to
the
court,
in
camera,
the
court
examined
the
statements
and
excised
in
--
in
certain
instances,
i
think
with
respect
to
most
of
the
reports,
certain
items
which
were
not
related
to
the
direct
testimony.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
--
this
court
--
no,
sir,
this
court
denied
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
that
respect.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
now
for
the
first
time
then,
this
is
--
the
government
has
complied
with
the
order
of
the
court
to
produce
these
statements.
the
court
has
excised
and
they've
been
turned
over
to
the
defense
then
cross-examination
commenced.
and
for
the
first
time,
it
was
elicit
from
the
witness
ondrejka,
the
fact
that
he
had
been
paid
while
he
was
working
in
connection
with
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
and
while
he
was
making
reports
to
the
bureau
concerning
his
communist
party
activities.
he
acknowledged
readily
that
he
received
payment
for
services
and
that
he
received
payment
for
certain
of
his
expenses.
he
specified
the
amounts
that
he
was
paid.
he
also
related
on
cross-examination
the
types
of
expenses
for
which
he
would
be
reimbursed
such
as
the
purchase
of
party
literature,
travel
expenses
in
connection
with
attending
certain
communist
party
meetings
that
were
out
of
town,
contributions
to
communist
party
fund
drives,
that
type
of
thing.
he
itemized
those
upon
cross-examination.
he
also
stated,
in
response
to
cross-examination,
that
he
would
report
these
expenses
or
certain
of
the
expenses,
the
principal
expenses
to
the
agent
of
the
f.b.i.
orally.
it
was
his
recollection
that
the
agent
would
jot
them
down
on
a
pad,
the
expenses
and
that
at
a
subsequent
time,
apparently
a
few
days
or
week
later,
the
agent
would
then
pay
him
what
the
expenses
had
been
and
on
occasion
for
where
the
--
the
services
had
been.
i
think
with
respect
to
ondrejka,
he
received
generally
for
in
the
beginning,
$25
a
month
plus
expense
money
and
later
on
i
think
he
was
getting
$50
a
month
for
his
services.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
that
is
so,
we
--
we
--
we
know
that.
however,
that
question
was
asked
on
cross-examination,
did
you
sign
receipts
in
the
trail
courts?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
was
subjected
to
and
the
trial
court
sustained
the
objection
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
now
upon
the
witness
giving
that
information,
the
defense
asked
the
trial
court.
they
made
another
general
motion
for
production
of
additional
statements
that
concerned
the
subject
matter
of
the
cross-examination
of
the
witness,
some
additional
matters
that
had
been
brought
out
on
cross-examination.
this
is
in
the
record
in
the
tran
--
transcript
of
the
546
and
547.
and
as
part
of
this
general
motion
which
again
asked
for
more
narrative
statements
a
move
for
an
order
to
produce
the
report
of
expenditures
by
this
witness
for
which
he
received
reimbursement
and
the
receipts
which
this
defendant
states
he
signed
to
evidence
payments
of
those
expenditures.
defendant
request
that
these
reports
be
delivered
to
counsel
for
the
defendant
on
excised
for
further
use
in
further
cross-examination
at
the
election
of
the
defendant.
the
government
objected
to
the
--
to
the
motion.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
if
i
--
actually,
your
honor
the
motion
runs
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
for
almost
three
pages.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
"the
--
the
defendant
now",
this
begins
on
546
and
it
--
and
it
goes
over
to
548
and
i'll
be
skipping
as
i
go
a
little
bit,
"the
defendant
now
moves
for
an
order
upon
the
government
to
produce
for
the
inspection
of
the
defendant,
all
statements
in
the
form
as
we
have
previously
defined
it,
whether
they
be
handwritten
or
typewritten
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
i
think,
what
they're
referring
to
there
is
all
statements
whether
mechanically
recorded
or
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
prior
motions.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
granted
in
part?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
“whether
written
or
typewritten
or
results
of
interviews
with
the
agents
of
the
federal
bureau
relating
to
the
testimony
of
this
witness
upon
cross-examination
insofar
as
he
testified
that
he
reported
to
the
federal
bureau
concerning
the
activity,
he
says
his
wife
engaged
in
and
other
people.”
that
was
elicited
on
cross-examination.
now
then
defendant
moves
further
for
an
order
upon
the
government
to
produce
for
the
inspection
of
the
defendant
for
using
further
cross-examinations.
the
report
of
expenditures
by
this
witness
for
which
he
received
reimbursement
and
the
receipts
which
this
defendant
states
he
signed
to
evidence
payments
of
these
expenditures.
i
think
that's
inaccurate
that
he
stated
he
signed.
it
is
a
fact,
but
of
course
he
was
subjected
to
and
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
concluding
part
of
this
--
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
--
in
his
motion,
he's
--
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
he
signed
statements
of
some
kind
to
evidence
payments.
my
observation
was,
and
i
think
that
was
an
error
because
it
did
not
so
state
the
court
having
objected
or
the
court
having
sustained
an
objection
to
the
question,
"did
you
sign
receipts?"
on
--
on
the
other
hand,
i
state
that
it
is
the
fact.
he
did
sign
receipts.
then
the
motion
concluded
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh,
no,
sir.
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir,
not
yet.
defendant
request
that
these
reports
be
delivered
to
counsel
for
the
defendant
on
excised
and
for
further
use
to
cross-examination.
the
government
objected
to
the
motion
on
the
basis
that
--
that
receipts
were
administrative
records
of
the
government
that
they
weren't
statements
within
the
meaning
of
the
jencks
statute
since
they
had
no
content.
they
didn't
speak.
i
think
the
idea
was
as
that
they
were
narrative
statements
of
the
witness.
that
they
didn't,
that
they
were
remote,
they
didn't
relate
to
his
direct
testimony.
however,
the
government
offered
to
produced
to
the
defense
a
schedule
of
payments,
schedule
which
had
been
prepared
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
which
itemized
month
by
month
the
amounts
paid
and
whether
for
services
for
expenses.
the
defense
counsel
upon
that
proper
by
the
governor
inquired,
and
this
is
on
551
in
the
transcript,
with
the
schedule
contained,
if
i
may
ask,
the
items
for
which
reimbursement
was
made.
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
replied,
"i
do
not
believe
that
they
do
and
it
is
my
impression
that
neither
do
the
receipts.
i
know
that
the
schedule
contains
the
dates
of
payments
and
the
amounts
from
the
beginning
to
the
end”.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
was
in
that
form
your
honor
and
i
think
it's
broken
down
month
by
month.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
other
words,
april
1951
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
$25
salary
under
the
salary
column
or
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
salary
and
maybe
$15
under
the
expenses.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
government
was
ready
to
give
a
--
a
compilation
that
had
been
prepared
which
stated
how
much
money
had
been
paid
month
by
month
to
each
of
these
witnesses.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
itemized
and
indicating
whether
or
not
the
particular
payment
was
for
services
or
for
expenses.
now,
the
expense
listing
did
not
say
that
$5
of
the
$15
was
for
attendings
of
the
c.p.
convention
or
what
--
whatever.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
a
bulk
items.
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now,
the
defendants
wanted
any
reports
that
the
witness
had
made
concerning
his
expenditures
and
the
receipts
signed
by
the
witnesses
for
moneys
received
from
the
f.b.i.
for
services
and
for
expenses.
now,
the
government
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
there
was
no
--
no
suggestion
that
there
was
a
difference.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir,
there
was
no
suggestion
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
--
and
as
to
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
and
--
and
the
defense
reasoning
for
refusing
to
reject
the
preferred
schedule
was
that
it
didn't
itemize
the
particularized
expenses.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
--
it
might
in
the
circumstances
of
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
particular
case.
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
in
your
hypothetical
situation
or
a
--
a
case
that
it
would.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
not
--
not
if
there
were
documents
which
in
fact
were
statements
or
our
statements
and
which
would
do
what
your
honor
supposes
in
--
in
the
hypothetical
would
be
accomplished.
in
other
words
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
the
government
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
well,
the
government
stated
in
reply
to
a
question
from
defense
counsel
that
the
schedule
is
not
itemized
and
neither
do
the
receipts.
and
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
--
and
that
we
now
find,
unfortunately,
is
not
the
fact.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
primarily.
and
--
and
the
reason
that
with
the
record
in
that
state,
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion,
i
don't
know
that
he
did
it
because
of
that
fact.
and
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
or
affirmed
the
conviction
believing
that
could
be
the
fact.
now,
we
now
know
in
preparing
our
brief
on
the
merits
here
that
9,
9
of
the
123
receipts
that
are
in
existence
and
that
are
involved
here
do
itemize
in
a
cryptic
form
and
we
have
tried
to
give
the
court,
now
in
page
26,
i
think,
of
the
brief,
an
example
of
the
nature
of
those
nine
receipts.
now,
all
the
nine
--
all
those
nine
receipts
are
ondrejka
receipts.
there
are
a
total,
i
think,
of
61
receipts
that
ondrejka
signed,
most
are
in
a
standard
receipt
form.
it
says,
"received
from
special
agent”,
so
and
so
“$25
for
services
during
the
month
of
april,
signed,
michael
j.
ondrejka”.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
we
concede
that
it
is
a
statement
your
honor.
we
do
not
concede
that
these
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
particular
statements
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
sufficiently
relate
to
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
the
direct
testimony
--
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
plus
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
if
--
if
related
in
--
it's
possible
that
in
two
or
three
particulars,
as
we
pointed
out
here
for
example,
a
reference
to
an
l.y.l.
meeting,
might
be
said
in
a
re
--
remote
sense
to
have
been
related
to
his
testimony
concerning
an
l.y.l.
meeting
that
if
the
court
were
to
decide
that
it
did
relate
in
that
narrow
or
--
or
very
broad
sense,
our
argument
is
that
there
was
no
prejudice
thereby
to
the
defendant
because
of
the
fact
primarily
that
he
had
the
narrative
reports
that
the
witness
made
to
the
f.b.i.
concerning
the
activities
about
which
he
testified
on
cross-examination.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct.
we
don't
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
we
don't
make
those
arguments
here
your
honor
to
--
in
an
effort
to
ask
the
court
to
affirm
here.
we
think
that
the
state
of
the
record
is
such,
that
it
can
only
be
fully
developed
and
we
think
that
in
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
particular
case,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
remand
to
permit
full
develop
of
the
record
with
respect
to
the
situation
in
this
particular
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
is
--
it
is
normal
practice
in
--
in
this
type
of
case
where
there
are
informants
testifying
that
the
f.b.i.
will
prepare
in
advance
a
trial,
one
of
these
schedules
of
payments.
and
in
addition,
the
--
the
bureau
will
ordinarily
also
prepare
photostatic
copies
or
at
least
one
photostatic
copy
of
the
original
receipts.
usually,
they
will
be
maintained
more
or
less
in
--
in
readiness
just
in
case
they
should
be
called
for
because
i
think
that
it's
clear
to
all
of
us
that
these
are
fairly
peripheral
types
of
statements.
in
other
words
--
of
course,
the
narrative
statements,
the
reports
that
the
witness
has
made
concerning
his
--
his
activities
in
the
party
and
about
which
is
going
to
be
called
upon
to
testify,
those
are
prepared
by
the
trial
attorneys
in
advance
and
they
--
they
confer
with
the
f.b.i.
on
what
should
be
exci
--
what
the
government
should
ask
for
excisions
on
and
the
concentration
is
on
the
narrative
statements.
however,
i
understand
that
here
as
in
the
usual
case,
the
f.b.i.
had
prepared
these
photostatic
copies.
and
that
they
were
in
the
f.b.
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
of
the
receipts
--
of
the
receipts.
and
that
they
were
in
the
f.b.i.
field
office.
i
understand
they
were
not
in
court.
they
didn't
have
in
court,
the
--
the
government
attorneys.
and
when
this
arose
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
made
this
representation,
he
was
doing
it
on
the
basis
of
information
that
he
had
received,
i
suppose,
in
conversations
with
other
attorneys
perhaps
and
maybe
some
f.b.i.
agents
working
on
the
case.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
these
are
usually
kept
in
the
field
office.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
they
probably
asked
the
f.b.i.
maybe
even
in
memorandum
form
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
to
procure
or
make
photostatic
copies
in
case
we
need
them.
now,
in
this
particular
instance,
i
understand
from
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
could
happen,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
i
--
i
think
that
--
if
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
of
course
if
you
weren't
careful
here,
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
it
would
be
easy
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
to
--
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
these
are
straight
receipts
all
the
way
through.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
your
honor,
in
--
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government's
brief
was
prepared
i
think
partly
here
in
washington,
partly
in
chicago
and
the
attorneys
who
worked
on
the
brief
relied
strictly
on
the
record
as
we
did
in
the
brief
in
opposition
in
this
court.
and
it
was
only
when
the
court
grant
a
certiorari
limited
to
these
questions.
i
--
i
think
we,
in
our
brief
in
opposition,
we
hardly
mentioned
receipts.
well,
i
think
our
argument,
first
of
our
argument
on
the
production
concerned,
the
narrative
reports
of
the
witness
and
--
and
the
questions
that
were
raised
thereon,
the
excisions
and
so
forth.
and
it
was
--
in
preparing
the
brief
on
the
merits,
that
the
attorney
preparing
the
original
draft,
prepared
a
memorandum
requesting
from
the
f.b.i.
copies
of
the
receipts
that
are
involved
--
were
involved
in
the
case.
and
it's
--
it
was
then
and
going
through
the
receipts,
it
was
found
out
that
some
of
the
receipts
do
itemize.
i
--
i
might
say
that
from
my
own
experience,
i
think
that
it
is
a
fairly
unusual
thing
that
receipts
of
informants
do
itemize
in
--
in
this
respect.
now,
i
--
i
think
this
is
one
thing
that
possibly
the
trial
court
might
inquire
into
and
might
take
into
consideration
with
respect
to
the
obligation
that
the
government
had
at
the
trial
here.
he
might
inquire
as
to
the
general
practice
as
to
the
prevailing
situation
and
possibly
taking
into
consideration
the
--
the
diligence
of
the
government.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
on
this
point,
i
think
that
essentially
is
the
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
where
he
is
called
upon
to
itemize
to
the
agent
or
where
he
does
is
a
practice
itemized
to
the
agent.
it
may
be
that
the
same
procedure
that
was
followed
here
is
followed.
but,
for
example,
take
sullivan's
receipts,
he
testified
that
his
arrangement
with
the
f.b.i.
was
that
he
received
a
certain
amount
of
money.
i
think
--
let's
say
$75
and
the
understanding
with
him
was
that
$10
of
that
amount
would
be
deemed
to
cover
his
expenses
so
that
all
of
sullivan's
receipts
or
everyone
of
them
just
says
received
of
special
agents
so
and
so
$75
for
services.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
that
this
type
of
thing
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
according
to
the
regular
practice?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
said
that
according
to
my
experience,
it
would
be
more
unusual
to
have
itemized
receipts.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
quite
unusual
to
have
itemized
receipts.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course
here
where
the
--
where
the
informant
apparently
was
called
upon
to
itemize,
the
agent
did
make
a
few
notes
which
--
which
we
think
clearly,
in
the
nature
of
things,
would
not
amount
to
a
statement
under
the
--
under
3500.
and
on
the
basis
of
those
notes,
he
would
incorporate
it
in
the
receipts.
now,
that's
seems
apparently
what
happened
here
so
that
there
isn't
a
destruction
of
the
records
in
a
situation
where
the
agent
was
asking
and
requiring
the
informant
to
itemize.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
what
--
what
i
--
what
i
meant
to
point
out
was
that
--
that
it's
probably
the
more
usual
procedure.
i
hate
to
generalize
because
i
don't
know
how
many
informants
there
are
or
what
the
practices
in
--
in
these
respects
in
all
cases
are
but
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
certainly,
this
is
a
very
usual
type
of
receipt.
the
--
the
sullivan
receipt,
it
--
it
says,
“i
received
$75”
and
he
is
supposed
to
absorb
if
he
has
to
pay
$2
for
literature
or
pay
50
cents
for
dues,
he
is
supposed
to
absorb
those
ordinary
expenses
out
of
his
--
out
of
his
money
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
his
$75.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
notes?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
this
--
in
--
in
this
particular
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
your
honor
as
i
said,
i
hesitate
to
generalize
an
--
an
appeal
in
which
i
certainly
necessarily
have
a
limited
amount
of
knowledge
which
would
only
go
to
informants
and
witnesses
with
whom
i
have
--
have
--
have
been
acquainted.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes.
we
--
we
based
it
on
the
information
that
we
have
--
that
we
received
from
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
asking
what
the
procedure
was
with
respect
to
these
two
witnesses
as
to
the
method
of
reporting
expenses
--
the
method
of
recording
expenses
whether
or
not
any
oral
or
any
notes
of
agents
of
expenses
have
been
retained
or
what
the
situation
is
actually
here
with
respect
to
the
existence
and
non-existence
of
any
statements
or
notes.
and
the
f.b.i.
advised
us
that
neither
ondrejka
nor
sullivan
submitted
written
expense
accounts.
they
also
stated
that
in
some
instances,
ondrejka
orally
furnished
the
contacting
agent
with
a
breakdown
of
his
expenses
incurred
during
the
pertinent
period
prior
to
the
date
of
payment.
the
agent
then
prepared
a
receipt
and
in
some
instances,
the
breakdown
of
expenses
was
incorporated
into
the
receipt
and
in
some
instances,
the
expenses
were
shown
only
as
a
lump
sum.
after
the
receipts
were
prepared,
any
notes,
the
contacting
agents
may
have
had
were
destroyed.
in
the
case
of
sullivan,
no
breakdown
of
expenses
was
maintained.
and
your
honor,
what
--
what
i
have
been
trying
to
say
is
that
in
the
usual
situation,
the
informant
receiving
so
much
money
per
month
is
called
upon
to
absorb
his
ordinary
expenses.
in
--
in
--
with
respect
to
ondrejka,
he
was
apparently
at
a
later
time
--
his
--
his
early
receipts
don't
show
any
breakdown.
they
just
show
“received
$25
for
expenses”.
there
is
no
breakdown.
it's
only
the
last
nine
receipts
covering
about
a
two-year
period.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
--
well
actually,
that
covers
the
period
from
june
of
1950
to
may
of
1953.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir,
large
--
largely
that
period.
the
early
receipts
of
ondrejka
prior
to
1950
don't
show
an
itemization.
now,
that
runs
for
a
--
during
the
year
or
beginning
at
september
1949
until
may
of
1950.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
then
--
then
apparently
in
june
of
1950,
he
started
itemizing
and
the
agent
incorporated
the
itemizations
in
the
receipt
were
had
he
--
had
not
done
as
prior
there,
too.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
on
december
11,
1952.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
day
they
executed
the
(inaudible)
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
have
to
say
that
the
whole
period
was
involved
because
the
government's
proof
was
that
he
had
been
a
member
for
a
few
years
prior
to
1952
and
he
continued
to
be
a
member
until
1953.
and
ondrejka
in
his
testimony
spent
that
--
that
crucial
date
of
the
execution
in
filing
of
the
affidavit.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
they
would
be
--
as
we
understand
the
situation,
the
ondrejka
might
be
talking
to
an
agent
on
the
phone
several
days
before
they
were
--
they
would
get
together.
and
he
would
mention
that
he
had
the
following
expenses
and
the
agent
would
jot
down
a
few
notes
as
to
what
those
expenses
were.
and
those
expenses
apparently,
were
incorporated
into
the
receipt
that
was
prepared.
now
sometimes,
too
apparent
and
of
course,
your
honors
will
appreciate
that
these
facts
even
we
have
not
fully
developed
because
there
are
many
details
that
--
that
could
be
developed
here
i
think.
sometimes
that
they
would
meet
and
ondrejka,
at
that
point,
would
tell
the
agent
what
his
expenses
had
been
and
the
agent
would
let
on
the
spot
prepare
a
receipt,
pay
him
the
money
and
ondrejka
would
sign
the
receipt.
now,
we
--
we
think
that
in
--
in
the
nature
of
thing,
the
--
the
notes
that
an
agent
may
have
made
while
ondrejka
was
listing
or
telling
him
what
expenses
he
had
incurred
would
only
be
what
--
what
i
call
a
cryptic
itemization.
l.y.l.
party
and
the
witness
probably
would've
said
in
the
--
in
the
middle
of
august,
i
went
to
a
labor
youth
league
party
and
we
all
had
to
contribute
$2
and
we
had
to
buy
this
or
that.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
certainly.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he'd
use
it
to
pay
him
and
to
later
incorporate
into
the
receipt
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
in
certain
instances
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
which
he
did.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i'd
--
it's
personal
in
the
sense
your
honor
that
he
is
not
making
it
to
become
a
government
record.
in
other
words,
if
in
the
course
of
an
investigation,
a
detective
jots
down
a
telephone
number
that
he
gets
from
a
--
from
somebody
he
interviews
or
he
jots
down
a
license
plate
or
he
makes
a
few
notes
as
to
some
leads
he
wants
to
follow,
they're
--
they're
notes
--
he
certainly
acting
as
a
government
agent
but
they're
--
they're
not
made
to
become
a
part
of
a
government
file.
they're
--
they're
notes
that
he
makes
for
his
--
for
the
performance
of
his
personal
duty.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
personal,
i
mean
they're
--
they're
on
behalf
of
the
government
but
i
mean
they're
his
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
personal
obligation.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
but
i
--
but
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
that
they
are
made
much
as
if
an
attorney
seating
in
a
court,
would
jot
down
a
few
notes
that
he
wants
to
--
to
mention
and
argue
something.
certainly,
he
is
not
making
notes
to
go
back
and
put
in
a
file.
and
ordinarily,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
argument,
he
will
probably
throw
them
in
a
waste
basket.
they're
--
they're
notes
that
he
makes
to
remind
him
of
something.
in
--
in
this
--
in
this
case,
i
think
it's
clear
that
he
probably
made
notes
and
then
from
the
notes,
he
made
these
itemizations
on
receipts.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
your
honor,
on
--
on
these
nine
receipts,
there
is
a
verification
that
these
--
these
itemizations,
l.y.l.
party,
party
literature,
things
of
that
sort,
this
is
the
verification
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
that
he
secured
from
the
informant.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
what
i
have
--
what
i
have
read
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
--
the
agent
then
prepared
a
receipt
and
in
some
instances,
the
breakdown
of
expenses
was
incorporated
into
the
receipt.
and
in
some
instances,
the
expenses
were
shown
only
as
a
lump
sum.
after
the
receipts
were
prepared,
any
notes
the
contacting
agents
may
have
had
were
destroyed.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
i
understand
it
your
honor,
it's
the
course
of
business.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
this
kind
of
a
note,
especially
the
agent's
original
notes
would
not
be
normally
retained.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
to
my
understanding,
he
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it's
--
it's
my
understanding,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
money
appropriated
which
does
not
have
to
be
accounted
for.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
law
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
congress
--
congress
has
appropriated
it
for
that
purpose
so
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
accounted
for.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
probably
most
law
enforcement
agency
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
at
least
after
they
were
prepared
the
--
in
other
words,
the
notes
might
be
used
so
that
the
--
just
so
the
agent
him
--
for
his
only
information
as
it
did
with
ondrejka.
now,
if
this
were
his
particular
practice
with
his
particular
informant
that
when
the
informant
itemized
for
him,
he
would
--
he
then
as
he
did
here,
trans
--
transposed
those
original
notes
to
the
receipt
itself
and
it
became
a
part
of
the
receipt.
apparently,
with
respect
to
other
instances
and
other
informants,
there
was
no
itemization
possibly
in
some
instances,
none
was
requested.
for
example,
sullivan's
arrangement
whereby
he
understood
that
$10
of
the
money
he
received
was
to
cover
his
ordinary
expenses
as
--
as
an
informant
or
as
a
--
going
around
to
the
party
meetings
and
buying
literatures
and
so
forth.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
not
with
respect
to
--
i'm
not
sure
of
the
precise
practice
on
notes
of
the
expense
--
expenses
such
as
this.
i'm
sure
that
policy
is
to
retain
notes
of
interviews
and
things
of
that
sort,
as
that
--
whereas
that
--
that
may
not
usually
have
been
done
in
the
past.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh,
this
--
this
entire
situation
is
pre-jencks.
this
case
was
tried
prior
to
the
--
first
tried,
prior
to
the
jencks
decision
and
had
been
affirmed
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
court
of
appeals
on
rehearing.
on
the
basis
of
jencks
reversed
the
first
conviction
so
that
everything
that
is
involved
here
with
respect
to
statements
had
to
occur
prior
to
the
jencks
decision.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
we
--
we
concede
that
these
are
his
statements
because
they're
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
assigned
by
the
witness.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
if
it
were
not
signed
by
the
witness.
in
other
words,
or
--
or
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
had
adopted
or
signed
that
he
had
accepted
it
as
his
own
words
then
i'd
make
the
definition
of
the
jencks
statute
that
it
would
have
to
be
substantially
verbatim
would
--
would
apply.
that's
--
that's
why
i
said
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
that
i
don't
think
that
the
agents'
notes
would
be
statements
because
they
--
they
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
i
don't
think
they
would
be
substantially
verbatim.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
if
they
were
not
signed?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
if
they're
not
signed
by
the
witness
then
i
think
the
statute
requires
that
the
statement
be
substantially
verbatim.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
to
be
substantially
verbatim.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
or
--
or
adopted.
and
--
and
--
in
other
words,
if
they
are
just
few
notes
of
summarizing
in
keywords
a
conversation,
that
is
not
a
statement
under
the
jencks
statute.
i
think
this
court
has
so
held.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
important
in
this
particular
case
to
--
to
understand
that
--
that
these
reports,
if
you
want
to
call
them
reports,
to
the
agent
concerning
expenses
were
not
made
with
--
with
the
view
in
mind
that
the
--
the
informant
was
thereby
reporting
some
activity
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
which
would.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
would
be
incorporated
into
an
investigative
file.
that
--
that
part
of
his
--
those
parts
of
his
reports
would
be
submitted
in
the
form
of
a
written
statement.
i
think
the
witness
is
here,
both
of
them
testified
that
they
reported
on
every
activity
they
went
to.
that
when
they
would
go
to
a
communist
party
meeting,
when
they
went
to
a
convention,
that
they
would
submit
to
the
f.b.i.
a
written
report,
sometimes
handwritten,
sometimes
they
would
orally
report
to
the
agent.
the
agent
would
then
make
a
summary
of
what
he
--
the
witness
had
told
him.
those
are
the
narrative
statements
which
were
produced
here.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
--
i
think
in
the
context
in
which
we
are
now
that
probably
in
examination
by
the
trial
judge
would
be
the
appropriate
way
for
that
determination.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
an
examination
of
the
statements
themselves
will
show
that
they
do
not
relate
to
the
subject
matter
of
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
they
--
that
they
don't
concern
--
well
they
don't
touch
upon
the
activities
about
which
he
has
testified
on
direct
examination.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
if
that
is
my
memory,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
specifically
we
did
not
inform
the
crowd
or
did
not
inform
the
jury
that
i
have
allowed
this
one
or
rejected
that
one.
we
read
them
one
after
the
other.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
--
i
--
i
trust
the
minutes
accurately
reflect
this
fact.
and
my
memory
--
if
my
memory
actively
reflects
the
fact
but
i
would
want
(inaudible)
i
suppose.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i've
--
i've
no
reason
to
think
otherwise,
your
honor.
