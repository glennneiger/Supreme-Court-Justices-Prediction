did
he
make
that
motion
also
with
respect
to
sullivan?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
claim
that
nondisclosure
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
at
that
representation
was
made
as
a
result
of
bad
phase
in
the
part
of
the
government
or
any
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
you
say
the
attorney,
you
mean
the
assistant
of
the
united
states
attorney
representing
the
government?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
you
made
no
statement
other
than
with
respect
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
the
attorneys?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
it
appear
in
the
record
whether
the
destruction
was
before
or
after
jencks?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
clarify
my
mind
on
one
thing.
we've
got
two
classes
of
documents
here.
number
one,
the
reports
which
were
destroyed,
the
government
says
it
were
made
by
these
informers
or
witnesses
to
the
f.b.i.
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
notes
taken
by
the
f.b.i.
or
the
agent
representing
the
witnesses'
reports
of
expenditures.
justice
john
m.
harlan
one
with
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
second
class
of
document
is
a
matter
of
the
receipts.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
nothing
to
show
at
the
present
time
whether
or
not
the
information
that
would
have
been
in
the
reports
was
all
included
in
the
receipts
which
are
still
in
existence,
am
i
correct?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
might
develop
from
a
further
showing
that
although
the
reports
are
destroyed,
still
the
receipts
that
are
in
evidence
contain
the
identical
information
as
to
the
character
of
expenditure
--
the
date
of
expenditure
that
would
have
been
found
in
the
reports.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
just
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
assume
that
the
membership
charge
was
alright
and
that
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
assume
it
--
assuming
you
haven't
invest
yourself
to
that
yet.
but
that
the
affiliation
charge
if
it
was
stood
alone
as
ambiguous,
i
don't
understand
how
anything
that
said
there
could
affect
the
membership
charge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
the
--
as
to
the
first
part
of
the
charge
of
--
the
affiliation
is
something
--
is
diluted
membership,
that
doesn't
affect
that
membership
charge
assuming
that
its
effect,
and
if
you
take
the
second
part
of
the
charge
which
internally
may
be
inconsistent,
and
assume
that
membership
and
that
the
affiliation
is
no
different
from
membership,
that
doesn't
confuse
the
membership
charge,
does
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
(inaudible)
of
the
issue
between
you
and
your
adversaries
on
this
jencks
find
is
simply
this,
isn't
it?
but
you
say
it
ought
to
go
back
so
that
the
court
--
whatever
the
district
court
does,
it
comes
back
to
this
court
ultimately
and
the
district
attorney
doesn't
grant
a
new
trial
that
we
can
then
decide
the
case
knowing
what
the
facts
are.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
your
adversaries
saying
now,
that
kind
of
a
--
investigation
is
not
necessarily
ought
to
reverse
(inaudible)
of
the
trial
now.
that's
the
whole
issue
between
you,
isn't
it
on
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
happen
to
know
from
a
--
whether
there's
any
difference
on
the
practice
on
these
notes
now
as
between
pre-jencks,
post-jencks
period
is
--
is
what
you
read
there
from
the
f.b.i.
related
to
pre-jencks
or
post-jencks?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
as
you
understand
it,
everything
that
we've
been
talking
about
here
is
pre-jencks.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
different
kind
of
a
statutes
in
scale,
is
that
your
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
scales
had
do
to
with
membership
in
an
organization
that
was
devoted
and
only
that
kind
of
membership,
it
had
(inaudible)
government
by
enforcing
violence
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it
does
membership
in
the
communist
party
hearing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
whole
charge
printed
however
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
characterized?
no,
not
printed,
is
it
in
the
--
in
the
minutes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
didn't
he
start
off
by
--
i
haven't
looked
at
it
yet
but
isn't
it
a
charge
in
the
conventional
form
when
you
agree
with
the
charge
or
not?
as
you
say
now
it's
my
review,
instruct
the
jury
and
then
go
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
he
does
not?
