justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say
is
the
date
of
this
last
statement
filed
by
the
solicitor
general?
justice
hugo
l.
black
informer
of
the
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
of
the
last
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
the
one
file,
september
27.
if
that's
the
one
you're
seeking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
had
known
that
the
papers
had
been
destroyed,
would
you
had
a
right
to
offer
that
fact
to
the
jury
on
your
evidential
principle
as
the
destruction
of
evidence
can
be
considered
by
them
in
determining
the
truth
of
what
the
witness
were?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
it
is
your
ruling,
is
in
your
judgement
in
the
--
is
an
evidential
rule
which
would
have
made
the
destruction
of
those
papers,
evidence
to
be
offered
by
the
jury
which
had
the
right
to
determine
his
guilt
or
his
innocence,
the
destruction
of
papers,
are
they
relevant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
government
asking
here,
that
the
matter
be
sent
back
to
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
determine
whether
or
not
demand
guilty
or
innocent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
your
purpose
in
asking
for
the
evidence,
these
statements
merely
to
read
it
or
to
read
it
with
the
view
if
it
justified
it
from
submitting
to
the
jury
of
trial
statements
that
were
not
consistent
of
what
had
been
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
other
point
i
have
in
mind
is
this.
i
had
thought
many
times
of
the
charges
to
the
jury
to
dissipate
that
if
you
believe
that
the
destruction
of
evidence
was
relevant
you're
entitled
to
consider
that
in
connection
with
the
fact
of
the
case
to
determine
the
credibility
of
the
witness
or
any
other
purpose
for
which
it
was
admissible.
when
where
you
first
informed
that
these
papers
had
been
destroyed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
27.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
simply
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
objected
to
--
insisted
that
you're
entitled
to
a
new
trial
rather
than
to
sending
it
back
to
the
jury
or
to
the
judge
to
pass
on
these
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
objected
that.
and
has
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
government
admitted
that
if
evidence
has
been
destroyed
which
is
the
contents
of
which
you
set
out
in
its
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
show?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
--
had
--
have
they
admitted
as
to
what
the
contents
of
any
of
those
papers
were?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
page
24,
the
government
says,
in
fact
we
have
been
informed
by
the
f.b.i.
agents
involve
no
such
written
reports
exist
today
and
nor
did
they
exist
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
agent,
we
are
told,
merely
made
handwriting
personal
notes
of
the
amount
spent
by
ondrejka
or
expenses
which
they
have
transcribed
to
the
receipts
later
signed
by
ondrejka
when
he
received
reimbursement.
personal
notes
were
destroyed
immediately
in
the
normal
course
of
operation
or
the
personal
notes
he
is
talking
about
there
is
a
personal
note
that
shows
what
this
man
had
put
down
with
reference
to
expenditures
of
witness,
ondrejka?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
it
your
contention
that
those
are
relevant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
now
you're
waiving
here
by
you
objecting
to
the
--
sending
this
case
back
to
the
judge
instead
of
the
jury?
are
you
waiving
your
right
--
any
right
to
argue
that
this
case,
if
it's
sent
back
at
all,
it
should
be
sent
back
to
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
the
destruction
of
relevant
papers,
would
be
high
limit
to
you
(inaudible)
are
you
waiving
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
they
did,
would
that
bar
you
from
showing
to
the
jury
that
they
have
destroyed
these
records
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
was
relevant
and
for
inferences
could
be
drawn
one
way
or
the
other
by
the
jury
of
whether
they
had
been
lawfully
destroyed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
a
fact
brought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
did
not
attempt
to
say
that
it
is
in
fact
simple.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
quite
understand
what
you're
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
the
ones
that
are
lost
or
destroyed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't
come
to
that
yet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
law
--
i
--
i
was
mentioning
that
--
i
think
that
some
special
law
probably,
as
i
judged
on
what
you
said,
which
authorizes
the
f.b.i.
to
pay
out
mo
--government
money
to
informants
who
claim
they
have
expended
in
various
places
without
having
any
record
of
it
at
all?
that
can
be
used
by
anybody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
law
authorizes
this?
i
may
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
may
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
from
your
(inaudible)
and
i
think
i
gather
and
maybe
it's
right,
maybe
that's
what
our
opinion
held
that
no
statement,
no
--
no
evidence,
written
evidence
from
a
government
record
which
is
not
a
"statement"
within
the
meaning
of
the
jencks
rule
can
ever
be
summoned
and
brought
into
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
seem
to
have
concluded
that
each
time
with
the
statement
with
--
with
this
argument
that
is
not
a
statement
within
the
jencks
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
part
of
it?
you
said
it
would
not
be
unless
certain
things
could
be
shown
to
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
their
statement
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
that
they
were
not
signed
by,
what
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
all
be
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
still
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
understand
even
though
papers
may
not
be
kept
as
they've
known
that
they
are
going
to
be
a
witness,
why
statement
relating
to
what
they
have
done
in
connection
with
the
activities
which
they
will
testify
should
be
habitually
destroyed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
wanted
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
wanted
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
statement
--
what
evidence
do
you
think
could
show
that
this
particular
statement
were
not
relevant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
weight,
i'm
talking
about
what
do
you
think
could
be
introduced
that
would
show
they
were
not
relevant
if
you
had
relate
to
expense
that
he
have
incurred
which
he
reported
what
he
was
doing
in
connection
to
this
examination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
not
relate
in
what
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
jus
--
justify
that
it's

on
the
point
(voice

appear.
