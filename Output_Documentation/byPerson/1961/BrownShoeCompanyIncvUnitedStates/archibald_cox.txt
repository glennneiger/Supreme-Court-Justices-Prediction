mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
archibald
cox
my
reaction
was
that
in
this
equity
appeal
it
didn't
have
to
be
a
final
judgment
and
that
i
am
told
although
i
haven't
checked
cases
myself
that
there
are
some
cases
justice
harlan,
the
hartley
paramount
case
and
others
which
have
come
to
the
court
in
substantially
this
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
we'll
verify
that
during
the
noon
recess.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it's
very
common
but
i
think
the
answer
is
this
is
an
equity
appeal,
interlocutory
decrees
--
interlocutory
injunctions
would
be
appealable,
and
that
takes
care
of
the
problem.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
would
be
our
position.
in
this
case
if
it
please
the
court,
the
brown
shoe
company,
a
third
or
fourth
depending
of
the
measure,
largest
shoe
manufacturer
in
the
country
and
the
major
factor
in
the
retail
markets
because
of
--
on
their
controlled
outlets
has
bought
up
the
nation's
largest
independent
chain
of
the
retail
shoe
stores.
for
many
years,
the
shoe
industry
was
characterized
by
small
manufacturers
and
by
small
independent
retailers
and
by
a
very
great
number
of
each,
so
that
one
had
a
condition
approaching
very
closely
to
the
economist's
classical
free
market.
in
recent
years,
as
the
district
court
found,
a
trend
toward
concentration
set
in,
so
it
is
now
a
danger
at
both
the
wholesale
or
manufacturer
sales
level
and
also
at
retail
level
that
the
former
classical
free
market
will
give
way
to
a
condition
of
oligopoly
such
as
we
associate
with
autos,
rubber,
some
electrical
products
and
the
like.
the
trend
toward
domination
by
the
large
companies
encompasses
three
developments.
first,
the
big
manufactures
are
beginning
to
get
more
factories
at
a
larger
share
of
the
factories.
the
large
chains
are
beginning
to
dominate
retail
and
growing
and
the
big
manufactures
are
now
acquiring
in
increasing
numbers,
the
big
chains
of
retail
stores.
the
process
had
not
gone
so
far
up
to
the
time
of
this
merger
that
the
statistics
showing
the
trends
towards
concentration
are
very
startling
in
combination
contrast
to
the
auto
industry
or
steel
or
the
like,
but
the
facts
found
by
the
district
court
make
it
plan
that
the
trend
is
all
to
evident.
in
practical
terms
therefore,
we
think
that
the
basic
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
the
essential
character
of
the
shoe
industry,
as
it
had
been,
will
be
preserved
or
the
dominant
firms
like
brown
will
be
allowed
to
lead
it
through
mergers
down
the
road
to
domination
by
biggies.
in
legal
terms,
the
question
arises
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
it
prohibits
one
business
firm
from
acquiring
the
stock
or
assets
of
another
when
the
effect
in
any
line
of
commerce,
in
any
section
of
the
country
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
so
here
the
ultimate
question
of
course
is
whether
under
the
circumstances
of
this
industry,
it
may
substantially
lessen
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce,
in
any
section
of
the
country
for
the
third
or
fourth
largest
manufacturer
and
the
largest
important
chain
of
retail
stores
to
be
combined.
we
think
that
brown's
acquisition
of
kinney's
assets
violates
section
7
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
vertical
combination
of
brown's
manufacturing
facilities
with
kinney's
outlets
deprives
other
manufacturers
of
a
fair
opportunity
to
compete
for
kinney's
purchasers.
this
aspect
to
the
merger
in
principal
that
is
as
to
the
kind
of
thing
leaving
the
quantitative
question
aside
is
no
different
of
course
between
--
from
the
dupont-general
motors
case
where
you
have
a
supplier
and
the
outlets
being
combined
and
therefore
creating
a
tendency
to
foreclose
other
suppliers
from
selling
in
those
companies.
mr.
archibald
cox
kinney
also
is
a
manufacturer
and
indeed
a
substantial
manufacturer
as
i
shall
point
out
in
a
moment.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
what
mr.
dean
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
what
mr.
dean
said
was
that
no
manufacturer
testified
that
he
had
been
displaced
by
brown's
acquisition
of
kinney.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
the
reason
i
say
that,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
a
number
of
manufacturers
testified
that
they
feared
that
this
would
displace
them
and
referred
the
past
instances
in
which
the
acquisition
of
a
retail
chain
by
a
manufacturing
company
had
displaced
their
sales.
so
that
in
terms
of
their
expectations,
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
question,
but
that
there
is
such
testimony
from
a
three-four
or
half
of
dozen.
i
couldn't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
don't
think
anyone
said
it
had
happened.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
hasn't
happen
yet
but
remember
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox
two
or
three
years
but
two
or
three
years
in
which
the
case
is
on
trial.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there's
a
specific
finding
that
that
would
be
likely
to
happen,
yes
sir,
by
the
district
judge
and
he
based
that
finding
like
most
of
his
other
finding
upon
the
testimony
of
live
witnesses
that
he
saw
as
well
as
heard.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
unusual
if
i
might
just
say
one
word
more.
this
unusual
antitrust
case
in
that
respectably
at
least
in
my
limited
experience
that
a
very
large
part
of
the
testimony
is
from
live
witnesses,
especially
with
respect
to
these
retail
markets.
retailers
came
in
and
told
what
the
competitive
situation
was
in
their
town
so
that
it's
peculiarly
a
case
in
--
at
least
in
respect
to
subsidiary
findings
for
applying
the
rule
with
respect
of
finality
of
the
district
court's
findings.
now,
excuse
me
justice
brennan.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
proceeding
was
begun
before
the
merger
was
actually
put
through.
it's
begun
late
in
1955
if
my
memory
is
right
and
the
merger
was
put
through
in
1956.
we
applied
for
a
temporary
injunction.
it
was
denied
on
condition
that
the
books
and
assets
be
kept
separate
and
not
physically
intermingled
so
that
the
divestiture
would
be
possible.
now,
i
was
outlining
the
three
grounds
on
which
we
contend
that
this
violates
section
7.
the
first
was
the
vertical
combination
of
the
manufacturer
with
the
outlet.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
combination
of
kinney's
manufacturing
facilities
with
brown's
manufacturing
facilities
standing
alone
substantially
lessens
competition.
we
think
its
part
of
the
picture
of
concentration,
but
we
don't
specifically
rely
on
that
because
the
district
court
didn't
find
for
us
in
that
respect.
our
second
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
did.
we
didn't
press
it
too
hard
that
it
was
--
but
it
was
part
of
our
case.
you
see
kinney
is
the
12th
largest
manufacturer.
it's
four
or
five
times
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
as
big
as
the
average
manufacturer.
mr.
archibald
cox
brown
is
third
or
fourth,
it
was
fourth
by
most
measures.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
--
oh,
one
of
the
--
yes
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
district
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
district
judge
was
apparently
more
impressed
and
i
think
rightly
by
the
effects
of
the
vertical
combination,
perhaps
this
thing
i'd
normally
speculate.
perhaps,
his
thinking
was
this,
that
the
problem
in
one
sense
will
be
that
putting
two
manufacturers
together
would
not
affect
the
market,
the
structure
of
the
market
nearly
as
much
as
foreclosing
a
large
part
of
the
area
in
which
you
could
sell,
which
would
of
course
for
a
short
time
intensify
the
competition
among
the
remaining
manufacturers
until
some
of
them
were
forced
out
of
business.
mr.
archibald
cox
its'
assert
--
and
i
think
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
the
district
judge
took
it
into
account
with
respect
--
oh,
i
meant
the
trend
in
the
market,
you
meant
the
tendency
under
the
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
think
it
remains
a
relevant
fact
your
honor
and
so
we
accept
the
finding.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
said
that
it
had
but
slight
effect.
i
don't
quite
know
--
i
wouldn't
say
that
was
against
us
but
it
doesn't
help
us
very
much.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
guess
so,
i
guess
so.
our
second
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
(voice
overlap)
all
i
aim
to
do
is
to
outline
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
points
then
i'm
going
to
develop
each
of
these
three
findings
in
some
length.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
total
became
4.4%.
mr.
archibald
cox
brown
was
getting
a
somewhat
larger
shares
of
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
number
had
dropped
to
900
and
some.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
number
of
manufacturers
in
this
industry
for
all
mr.
dean's
ease
of
entry,
from
1947
to
1954
had
dropped
10%
and
from
1954
to
1958
dropped
another
10%,
not
at
the
lower
figure
but
at
the
higher
of
total
of
20%
in
11
years.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
there
was
nobody
--
the
ease
of
entry
is
purely
theoretical.
no
one
could
name
anyone
who
entered
except
back
in
the
1940s.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
depends
a
little
on
the
exact
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
universe
you
--
you
select.
it
depends
whether
you
include
the
slippers.
it
depends
whether
your
sales
or
pairs
but
it
ranges
from
4.5%
to
5%.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
but
i'd
rather
had
--
well,
i
didn't
tend
to
dispute
that.
my
point
was
that
it
--
one
must
be
careful
before
concluding
that
there's
an
inconsistency
in
being
sure
that
he's
using
comparable
measures
and
there's
a
quite
number
of
cases
where
there's
a
--
a
superficial
inconsistency
explainable
on
that
ground.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
think
it
was.
mr.
archibald
cox
there's
--
there
is
one
erroneous
figure
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh.
our
second
point
of
attack
on
the
merger
in
showing
that
it
violates
section
7
is
that
we
think
that
the
horizontal
merger
of
brown's
and
kinney's
retail
outlets
will
lessen
competition
between
them
in
men's,
women's
and
children's
shoes
in
about
140
existing
retail
trade
areas
and
prospectively
in
additional
retail
trade
areas
especially
in
the
new
suburban
areas.
under
the
first
point
--
under
the
first
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
real
question,
so
perhaps
i
can
focus
the
argument
a
little,
is
whether
the
tendency
is
substantial,
whether
the
figures
are
big
enough
to
meet
the
test
of
substantial.
under
this
head,
i
would
think
there
were
two
main
points
to
keep
in
mind.
one
is
the
question
whether
brown's
franchise
dealers
should
be
counted
as
we
think
as
brown's
outlets
in
determining
whether
the
merger
may
lessen
retail
competition
between
brown
and
kinney
and
i'll
explain
the
reasons
we
think
they
should
be
counted
in
a
moment.
and
second,
there's
a
technical
question
whether
the
138
cities
in
their
environment,
having
a
population
in
excess
to
10,000
in
which
competition
will
be
substantially
lessen,
constitute
either
singly
or
collectively
a
section
of
the
country
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
our
third
argument
is
in
substance
that
even
if
we
should
not
prevail
on
either
of
the
first
two
or
both
standing
alone
that
they
are
sufficient
together
to
find
a
violation
of
section
7.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
the
merger
of
the
fourth
largest
manufacturer,
with
a
largest
retail
chain
plus
the
combination
of
their
retail
outlet
will
so
increase
the
relative
size
of
the
enterprise
as
to
give
it
a
decisive
advantage
over
small
competitor,
thus
concentrating
undue
economic
power
in
violating
section
7.
under
this
head
i
think,
again
the
only
serious
question
although
others
are
raised
is
the
question
of
substantiality.
each
of
these
three
central
propositions
is
incorporated
in
the
ultimate
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
district
court.
each
of
those
ultimate
findings
and
conclusions
rest
upon
subsidiary
area
findings
effect
and
there
we
think
in
turn
are
supported
by
the
evidence.
as
i
said
earlier,
the
evidence
comes
chiefly
from
live
witnesses
and
is
therefore
of
a
character
which
--
on
which
the
district
court's
finding
are
entitled
to
decisive
weight
unless
clearly
erroneous.
now,
i
tend
to
develop
my
argument
under
the
three
main
heads,
and
to
deal
with
the
question
line
of
commerce
section
of
the
country
when
i
come
to
it
under
each
of
those
three
main
heads
because
then
we
talk
about
it
not
in
the
abstract
but
were
denied
to
the
purpose
or
function
of
the
concept
in
the
development
of
the
law
and
the
decision
of
this
case.
before
i
come
to
developing
those
three
propositions
however,
it
seemed
appropriate
to
me
since
this
was
the
first
major
case
to
come
before
the
court
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
to
say
something
about
the
meaning
of
that
section
and
its
legislative
history
so
that
there
maybe
a
legal
background
against
which
to
appraise
these
quite
complicated
and
detailed
facts.
it
its
original
form
as
enacted
in
1914,
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
you'll
recall,
prohibited
corporation
from
acquiring
a
whole
or
any
part
of
the
stock
or
other
share
capital
of
two
or
more
corporations
where
the
effect
of
such
acquisition
maybe
to
substantially
lessen
competition
between
such
corporations,
then
it
went
on
with
other
provisions
not
relevant
here.
the
legislative
history
of
the
original
section
7
makes
it
quite
plain
that
congress
thought
--
sought
even
then
to
halt
the
trend
toward
concentration
by
preventing
mergers
that
might
substantially
lessen
competition,
even
though
the
degree
of
market
control
resulting
did
not
reach
such
a
stage
that
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
the
aim
as
it
was
stated
at
the
time
was
to
check
restraints
of
competition
in
their
incipiency.
as
matters
developed,
section
7
had
three
short
comings.
first,
it
did
not
reach
corporate
mergers
like
this
one
which
were
accomplished
through
the
acquisition
of
assets.
second,
since
section
7
prohibited
one
corporation
from
acquiring
stock
to
the
second
corporation
where
the
effect
of
such
acquisition
maybe
to
substantially
lessen
competition
between
such
corporations,
it
was
widely
but
erroneously
assumed
that
section
7
did
not
apply
to
vertical
combinations,
but
only
apply
it
to
a
combination
between
competitors.
third,
this
in
terms
very
strict
prohibitions
against
stock
acquisition
where
the
effect
of
such
acquisition
might
be
to
lessen
competition
between
the
competer
--
competitors
between
the
acquiring
and
acquired
corporations
was
so
strict
that
there
was
a
tendency
to
read
into
it
limitations
similar
to
those
applied
in
interpreting
the
sherman
act,
notions
of
market
control
or
unreasonable
restraints
or
restraints
in
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
world
war
ii
set
off
a
new
wave
of
corporate
mergers.
economists,
i
think
i
should
say
are
still
debating
their
true
impact,
but
it's
quite
plan
that
they
gave
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
congress
very
grave
concern.
that
concern
led
directly
to
the
amendment
of
section
7
in
an
effort
to
halt
economic
concentration
and
to
preserve
the
opportunities
of
small
businessmen.
the
effort
came
to
a
climax
when
section
7
was
amended.
more
particularly,
the
amendments
read
against
the
committee
reports
and
the
legislative
debate
had
two
main
general
purposes.
first,
many
american
industries
had
even
then
have
been
transformed
by
the
emergence
of
a
handful
of
dominant
firms.
in
those
industries,
the
markets
no
longer
were
free
at
least
in
the
sense
of
the
classical
economist.
they
were
dominant
--
there
was
--
they
characterized
by
price
leadership
by
large
dominant
firms
and
either
by
an
absence
of
opportunities
by
small
--
for
small
businessmen
or
by
a
small
businessman
who
operated
under
the
shelter
of
the
umbrella
of
the
large
firms
as
long
as
they
kept
their
proper
place
in
the
hierarchy.
in
other
industries,
notably
in
textiles,
apparel,
and
some
branches
of
food
and
the
like,
the
older
classical
condition,
the
ideal
of
small
business
continued
to
prevail.
now,
section
7
quite
clearly
was
intended
to
do
what
congress
could
to
preserve
the
latter
condition
in
those
industries
where
it
still
existed.
thus
the
senate
committee
said
then
i
think
that
it's
worth
imposing
a
quotation
upon
the
court,
the
type
of
problem
to
which
the
bill
was
addressed
was
described
by
the
federal
trade
commission
in
these
words.
“where
several
large
enterprises
are
extending
their
power
by
successive
small
acquisitions,
accumulative
effect
of
their
purchases
maybe
to
convert
an
industry
from
one
of
intense
competition
about
many
enterprises
to
one
in
which
three
or
four
large
concerns
produced
the
entire
supply.
this
latter
pattern,
which
economists
called
oligopoly,
is
likely
to
be
characterized
by
avoidance
of
price
competition
and
by
respect
on
the
part
of
each
concern
for
the
vested
interest
of
its
rival.
in
district
remember,
is
what
the
committee
said
was
the
type
of
problem
to
which
the
bill
was
directed.
and
i
may
say,
it
seems
to
us
to
be
the
very
type
of
small
acquisition
that
has
taken
place
in
this
industry,
in
this
case.
second,
it
should
be
emphasized
that
congress
was
not
motivated
solely
by
considerations
of
economic
efficiency.
it
was
moved
by
a
social
philosophy.
it
was
distressed
that
the
small
businesses
and
small
industries
were
being
forced
under,
were
being
wiped
out
by
mergers,
that
the
little
fellow
no
longer
had
the
opportunity
he
had
once
had
in
america.
judge
pope
stated
the
point
very
effectively
in
the
crown
zellerbach
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
a
few
months
ago,
“as
the
legislation
was
under
consideration
by
congress,
it
was
duly
appreciated
that
decentralized
and
deconcentrated
markets
are
often
uneconomic
and
provide
higher
cost
and
prices.
all
this
it
--
it,
meaning
congress
laid
aside
in
its
concern
over
the
curse
of
bigness
and
the
concentration
of
power,
the
nation's
market
which
congress
thought
advantaged
the
big
man
and
disadvantaged
the
little
one.
to
achieve
these
two
broad
purposes
partly
economic
and
partly
social,
congress
made
three
changes
in
section
7
which
corrected
the
three
inadequacies
or
omissions
that
i
pointed
out
earlier.
in
the
first
place
section
7
was
explicitly
extended
to
cover
acquisition
of
assets.
second,
it
was
made
applicable
to
vertical
combinations
by
eliminating
the
requirement
that
the
acquisition
be
shown
to
substantially
lessen
competition
between
the
acquired
and
the
acquiring
firms.
instead,
section
7
now
pro
--
now
prohibits
acquisitions
whereas
i
said
before
in
any
line
of
commerce,
at
any
section
of
the
country,
the
effect
of
such
acquisition
maybe
to
substantially
lessen
competition.
it
doesn't
say
between
whom,
just
competition
in
the
market.
the
effect
of
the
latter
change
as
congress
fully
realized
was
to
eliminate
any
possibility
that
the
sherman
act
rule
of
reasoning
or
notions
of
market
control
or
market
dominance
would
apply
under
section
7
that
the
aim
was
to
eliminate
any
chance
if
that
would
happen.
here
again,
the
senate
committee
report
and
the
house
committee
report
make
this
indisputably
clear,
“by
eliminating
the
provisions
of
the
existing
section,
which
would
appear
to
read
situations
of
little
economic
significance,
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
to
ensure
a
broader
construction
of
the
more
fundamental
provisions
that
are
retained
that
has
been
given
in
the
past.”
the
intent
here
as
in
other
parts
of
the
clayton
act
is
to
cope
with
monopolistic
tendencies
in
their
incipiency
and
well
before
they
have
attained
such
effects
as
would
justify
a
sherman
act
proceeding.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
certainly
addressed
--
i
think
it
was
addressed
to
two
changes.
it
was
addressed
to
the
dropping
of
the
words
in
any
community
and
focusing
in
on
any
section
of
the
country
which
i
perhaps
improperly
slid
over
because
it
wasn't
part
of
my
main
theme.
it
was
also
quite
clearly
addressed
to
the
elimination
of
the
requirement
that
to
be
--
or
rather
i
should
say
to
the
pro
--
to
the
proscription
of
all
mergers
which
would
substantially
lessen
competition
between
the
acquired
and
the
acquiring
firm
but
as
you
see,
would
prohibit
practically
any
merger.
and
congress,
it
wasn't
really
--
the
courts
to
get
over
that
had
begun
to
read
qualifications
in
it
and
it's
quite
clear
that
the
aim
was
to
get
rid
of
those
qualifications
by
setting
up
not
quite
so
strict
a
test
but
one
which
was
not
as
strict
as
the
test
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
find
this
over
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
well,
it
was
--
the
aim
was
to
loosen
somewhat
in
these
directions
or
the
aim
to
tighten
it
–
tighten
in
others.
i
take
again
on
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
concentrate
on,
it
was
stated
in
the
house
report
as
well
and
also
frequently
on
the
floor
that
the
result
of
the
changes
was
to
frame
a
bill
which
reaches
far
beyond
the
sherman
act.
it
wouldn't
do
it
i
suppose
in
the
sense
in
words
alone
because
the
words
that
proscribe
any
merger
that
eliminated
any
competition
between
the
two
firms
would
proscribe
all
mergers
but
that
had
been
watered
down
by
reading
things
into
it
and
the
court
--
that
congress
that
was
concerned
about
backtracking
it,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way
on
the
watering
down.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
--
it
didn't
use
the
words
backtrack
on
watering
down.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
all
--
i
changed
the
words
and
changed
the
words
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they
do,
so
quite
clearly.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
it
was
tightening
geographically.
i
meant
to
suggest
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
it
was
tightening
in
terms
of
the
degree
of
the
fact
on
the
structure
of
the
market
or
the
quantity
of
competition.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
tightening
when
you
took
the
judicial.
in
the
words
of
the
original
statute
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
as
judicially
interpreted.
mr.
archibald
cox
again
--
mr.
archibald
cox
less
--
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
on
the
face
of
them,
they
were
less
restrictive
provided
you
had
competition
between
the
acquired
and
acquiring
company.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
it
relieved
the
occasion
which
had
produced
the
gloss.
congress
had
gone
manifestly
in
the
words,
the
court
thought,
manifestly
too
far.
mr.
archibald
cox
thus
far
--
thus
far
your
honor,
it
hasn't.
the
courts
--
short
of
this
court
could
have
considered
it
reading
these
change
in
the
light
of
the
previous
judicial
interpretation
of
section
7
and
the
committee
reports
and
the
natural
meaning
of
words
of
the
amended
statutes
have
precluded
that
it
does
lay
down
a
stricter
test
one
falling
far
short
of
the
--
one
far
more
strict
than
that
which
would
be
imposed
under
the
sherman
act.
now,
there's
another
but
i'll
proceed
to
another
point
which
i
think
bears
on
this
so
far
as
the
exact
words
go
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
there
is
--
there
are
two
farther
points
that
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
and
the
first
of
them
at
least
bears
directly
on
this.
it
wasn't
chance
that
congress
used
the
words
where
the
effect
may
be
to
substantially
lessen
competition.
section
3
of
course
had
long
prohibited,
tying
clauses
and
requirements
contract
where
the
effect
in
the
same
words
except
that
the
infinitive
split
where
the
effect
maybe
to
substantially
lessen
competition
and
a
clause
had
a
very
--
just
before
the
1950
amendment
had
been
written
on
those
words
in
the
standard
service
station
case
at
337
u.s.
where
the
court
specifically
refused
to
embark
on
the
kind
of
broad
economic
inquiry
that
would
be
pertinent
under
the
rule
of
reason
under
the
sherman
act
referring
to
the
chicago
board
of
trade
case,
and
said
that
the
sole
question
was
whether
the
qualifying
clause
of
section
3
and
it
held
that
the
qualifying
clause
of
section
3
is
satisfied
by
proof
that
competition
has
been
foreclosed
in
a
substantial
share
of
the
line
of
commerce
effectively.
and
so
here,
it
seems
plain
to
us
that
when
congress
used
to
very
words
that
had
--
had
that
clause
put
upon
them
in
section
3,
only
a
year
or
two
before.
and
when
congress
stated
that
section
7,
the
new
language
of
section
7
was
intended
to
be
given
an
interpretation
similar
to
those
which
the
courts
would
apply
in
interpreting
the
same
language
in
other
sections
of
the
clayton
act
that
it
must
have
meant
to
interpret
the
attitude
or
gloss
that
had
been
written
on
those
words
in
the
standard
stations
case,
and
that
essentially
is
the
meaning
that
we
claim
that
should
have
here.
the
one
further
point
in
the
legislative
history,
it
does
show
with
unusual
specificity
i
think
the
kinds
of
mergers
which
would
have
the
unwanted
effect
upon
the
market.
the
committee
listed
three,
i
won't
read
the
passage,
but
which
are
particularly
applicable
to
this
case.
first,
it
spoke
of
combinations
which
establish
relationships
between
buyers
and
sellers,
which
deprived
the
rivals
of
a
fair
opportunity
to
compete
and
of
course,
that
is
a
reference
to
the
kind
of
vertical
integration
that
we
have
in
the
present
case.
second,
it
spoke
of
eliminating
activity
which
had
previously
been
a
substantial
factor
in
competition.
we
think
that
eliminating
kinney
as
an
independent
concern
in
the
retail
markets
eliminates
as
we
shall
show
what
was
a
substantial
factor
in
competition.
and
third,
congress
made
it
very
clear
that
it
was
concerned
about
increases
in
the
size
of
an
enterprise,
making
the
acquisition
to
such
a
point
that
its
advantage
over
its
competitors
threatens
to
become
decisive
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
district
court
found
in
virtually
those
words
was
happening
as
a
result
of
this
merger.
i
turn
first
then
to
the
effect
of
the
merger
of
brown
and
kinney,
judged
vertically
its
effect
in
the
manufacturers'
market
where
we
submit
that
the
result
of
combining
the
third
or
fourth
largest
manufacturer
with
the
largest
independent
retail
chain
will
be
to
substantially
lessen
competition
in
the
manufacturers
nationwide
markets
for
men's,
women's
and
children's
shoes.
it's
important
to
remember
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
that's
what
the
distinct
court
found
and
that's
the
way
we
refer
to
it,
and
i
shall
specifically
deal
with
that.
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
this
is
an
industry
in
which
four
firms
or
manufacturers
have
already
become
dominant.
brown
is
ranked
third
or
fourth
of
the
--
whether
you
measure
it
by
its
assets,
its
net
sales
or
its
total
production.
in
1956
--
1955,
brown
had
37
factories
and
it
ranked
fourth
in
production
by
volume
and
third
by
sales.
the
big
four
had
a
quarter
roughly
of
the
national
production
in
volume
and
30%
in
sales.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
volume,
24.6%.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
brown
had
--
mr.
archibald
cox
brown's
percentage
was
about
4%.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
--
well,
the
big
two,
they
came
down,
the
endicott-johnson
and
the
international
--
they're
bigger
than
brown.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
the
third
and
fourth
were
much
closer
than
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir.
in
pairage,
brown
was
in
fourth,
so
that
you
had
three
bigger.
the
figures
are
in
the
record.
they
ranged
up
to
4%
or
4
plus
percent,
6%,
7%
and
10%
or
something
like
in
figures
in
my
mind.
brown's
production,
i
should
emphasize
was
two
and
a
half
times
that
of
the
fifth
ranking
firm.
in
1955,
brown
was
five
times
and
in
1956
six
times
the
size
of
the
11th
ranking
firm,
this
pairs
on
its
relative
position
in
the
industry
and
the
effect
of
giving
in
any
added
preference
in
the
market.
in
19
--
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
manufacturing
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
measured
by
pairs.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
kinney
was
12.
i
was
going
on.
brown
in
1956,
brown's
production
was
equal
to
the
total
production
of
the
ten
firms
ranking
11
through
20.
one
last
figure
in
1955
or
1956,
brown
was
48
times
the
size
of
the
average
manufacturer
in
the
industry.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
comparison
to
brown
was
small
in
manufacturing,
i'm
speaking
only
of
manufacturing.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
--
on
the
other
hand,
kinney
you
see
was
four
times
the
average,
so
kinney
was
small
compared
to
brown.
kinney
was
--
is
big
too
strong
a
word
in
relation
to
the
average,
four
times
in
any
event,
so
that
it
was
hardly
unimportant.
brown
did
not
achieve
this
position
simply
by
manufacturing
and
selling
more
shoes.
the
list
of
brown's
acquisitions
is
important
in
measuring
the
trend
in
the
industry.
brown
in
1946
acquired
entry
in
footkind,
in
1948,
milius,
in
1950,
spalsbury-steis,
in
1952,
bourbeuse,
1953,
monogram,
o'donnell,
and
kaut,
lauman
and
winter,
in
1954,
regal
and
then
in
1955-1956,
it
wanted
to
and
did
acquire
kinney.
so
this
has
been
a
matter
of
successive
--
mr.
archibald
cox
regal
was
1954.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
these
are
other
manufacturers.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
speaking
exclusively
of
manufacturing
involved
--
mr.
archibald
cox
retail,
well
--
but
i'm
talking
--
speaking
of
regal's
manufacturing
facilities.
regal
had
very
considerable
manufacturing
facilities.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
acquired
both.
this
was
just
--
i
didn't
intend
to
mislead.
it's
just
a
selective
process
because
i
was
concentrating
on
the
effect
in
the
manufacturer's
market.
mr.
archibald
cox
(inaudible)
college.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
1950
--
i
turn
now
to
the
retailer.
in
1951,
brown
begun
to
move
directly
under
retailing
by
the
purchase
of
the
wohl
shoe
company
which
brown's
president
described
as
the
first
really
big
acquisition
by
one
of
the
leading
shoe
manufacturers
and
he
went
on
to
point
out
that
this
brought
together
one
of
the
largest
manufacturers
with
the
largest
operator
of
leased
departments
in
the
country.
wohl
was
a
very
considerable
retail
outlet.
it
leased
shoe
departments
and
department
stores.
there
were
250
outlets
in
1951,
379
in
1955,
457
in
1958.
these
are
after
brown's
acquisition
an
increase
of
80%
in
seven
or
eight
years.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
wohl.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
department
store
outlet.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
no.
well,
wohl
is
also
a
wholesaler.
mr.
archibald
cox
one
of
the
few
wholesalers
in
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
except
possibly
one
or
two
stores.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
essentially
an
operator
of
leased
outlet.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
this
is
for
the
wholesale
division.
it
--
it
sets
them
up
if
i
may
say
with
strings
attached
to
buying
their
shoes
through
wohl.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
gets
an
increasing
percentage
of
them
from
brown.
it
does
not
--
it
does
not
get
all
it
shoes
by
any
means
all
it
shoes
from
brown.
the
figures
show
that
wohl's
purchases
in
19
--
let
me
give
you
the
figures,
1950
and
1957.
wohl
purchased
from
brown
in
1950
that
was
the
year
before
the
acquisition,
two
million-eight,
in
dollars.
in
1957,
it
purchased
just
over
12
million
in
dollars.
that's
a
320%
increase
in
brown
sales
to
wohl
following
the
acquisition.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
recess,
i
attempted
to
describe
the
manufacturers
in
the
industry
and
brown’s
position
as
one
of
the
dominant
form
in
an
industry
dominated
by
four
concerns.
and
then
i
began
to
go
on
to
point
out
that
even
before
acquiring
kinney,
brown
had
begun
to
tie
up
retail
outlets
because
we
think
that’s
a
relevant
circumstance
in
determining
whether
this
tying-up
more
of
it
was
a
substantial
factor
in
lessening
competition.
i
pointed
out
already
that
brown
had
acquired
wohl,
the
largest
operator
of
leased
outlets
and
department
stores.
it
acquired
regal's
98
stores
as
well
as
the
manufacturing
facilities
in
1954,
where
the
wetherby-kayser's
four
los
angeles
stores
and
independents
in
four
texas
cities
and
in
columbus,
ohio.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but,
primarily
yes.
but
we
wouldn't
say
that
--
i
think
i
would
disagree
with
what
seems
to
me
be
the
implication
that
you
take
what
someone
is
primarily
in,
then
narrow
to
that
and
say
that
is
the
line
of
commerce.
mr.
archibald
cox
regal
is
a
seller
of
men's
shoes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
the
acquisition
of
regal
looked
at
vertically
would
simply
tie
up,
a
part
of
the
market
for
men's
shoes,
not
part
of
the
market
for
manufacturer
selling
women's
shoes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
i
was
thinking
of
price
--
mr.
archibald
cox
they're
not
competitive
with
each
other.
in
addition
to
the
owned
outlets
on
through
these
firms
that
it
acquired,
brown
also
had
584
franchise
dealers
at
the
time
of
the
merger.
firms
which
were
received
assistance
from
brown
in
various
forms
and
in
return
for
which
they
committed
themselves
at
one
time
not
to
purchase
from
other
competing
manufacturers.
on
advice
of
counsel
as
the
record
puts
in,
that
was
eliminated
from
the
written
contract
and
was
watered
down
to
a
commitment
not
to
carry
any
conflicting
lines.
and
if
a
brown
franchise
dealer
were
to
carry
a
conflicting
line,
unless
it
was
a
casual
incident,
he
would
be
cut
off
as
a
brown
franchise
dealer.
there
were
a
number
of
advantages
in
being
a
brown
franchise
dealer.
one
was
that
you
were
able
to
purchase
rubber-soled
canvass
shoes
at
a
discount
from
goodrich
and
otherwise
that
you've
got
the
benefits
and
certain
advantages
in
the
form
of
insurance,
both
group
life
insurance
and
also
buyer
casualty
insurance.
still
another
advantage
as
i
understand
it
was
that
also
some
of
the
outlets
might
get
occasional
health
and
merchandising
and
inventory
control
in
planning
their
stocks
and
architectural
design.
there
is
testimony
quoted
in
that
brief
to
the
effect
that
you
got
this
far
more
regularly
and
successfully,
if
you
are
a
brown
franchise
dealer
which
carried
with
it,
i
emphasize,
the
obligation
not
to
use
--
not
to
--
to
concentrate
in
brown
shoes
and
therefore
to
exclude
conflicting
lines.
now,
it's
true
you
could
quit
at
anytime,
but
the
bait
was
there,
if
i
may
it
colloquially.
you
got
certain
advantages
that
you
gave
up
if
you
quit
and
as
long
as
you
were
a
brown
franchise
dealer,
this
was
an
outlet
which
was
wholly
or
which
was
partially
foreclosed
at
least
so
far
as
shoes
competing
with
brown
were
concerned.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
there
was
turnover,
and
the
brown
franchise
dealers
sold
other
shoes
--
shoes
that
didn't
compete
with
brown.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
a
number
of
them
--
a
number
of
them
quit.
but
the
total
number
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
total
number
was
constantly
growing.
there
were
470
in
1950,
584
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
647
in
1958,
so
that
this
is
an
increasing
part
of
the
market.
the
kinney
shoe
company,
we
discussed
it's
less
important
manufacturing
facilities
before.
as
a
retailer,
it
was
in
that
capacity
that
it
was
important
to
brown
and
is
significant
here
and
has
its
major
significance
here
in
this
case.
it
was
the
largest
retail
chain
of
family
shoe
stores.
it
had
352
stores
in
312
cities
and
it
too
was
rapidly
growing.
for
example,
from
the
time
of
the
merger
until
1958,
its
stores
increased
to
418,
an
increase
of
80%.
if
you
look
at
its
outlets
and
shopping
centers,
too,
there
were
50
in
1955,
a
118
three
years
later
and
136
--
an
increase
of
a
136%.
in
1955,
kinney's
sales
were
6,400,000
pairs
of
shoes
purchased
from
outside
sources.
and
is
other
than
in
addition
to
its
own
manufacturer.
it
sold,
lumping
them
all
together,
1.3%
of
the
national
total.
broken
down
into
the
three
categories,
kinney
sold
1.7%
of
children's
shoes,
1.4%
of
women's
shoes,
there
was
a
much
smaller
factor
in
the
men's
shoe
market,
only
3%.
so
that
to
pull
this
together,
the
merger
combined
the
fourth
and
13th
largest
manufacturers.
the
fourth
largest
manufacturer
in
the
market
with
the
most
aggressive
and
largest
of
the
independent
retailers
having
1.7%
of
the
children's
market
and
1.4%
of
the
women's
and
less
than
one-half
of
1%
of
the
market
for
men's
shoes.
and
we
come
to
the
question
whether
the
vertical
effect
of
this
merger
would
substantially
lessen
the
competition
--
might
substantially
lessen
the
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce,
in
any
section
of
the
country.
our
argument
which
i
think
i
outlined
before
is
that
brown's
capture
of
kinney's
outlets
violates
section
7
because
its
tendency
will
be
to
foreclose
competition
and
send
--
selling
shoes
to
kinney
and
that
this
segment
of
the
market,
the
kinney
segment
under
all
the
circumstances
of
this
industry
is
substantial.
so
that
the
three
elements,
we
must
attend
to.
first,
we
must
define
the
market
in
terms
of
the
section
of
the
country
and
the
product
or
line
of
commerce.
second,
i
have
to
address
myself
to
the
question,
is
there
a
reasonably
likelihood
that
the
acquisition
will
lessen
the
competition.
and
then
third,
i
must
show,
of
course,
that
the
substantial
share
of
the
market
is
affected.
geographically,
the
market
is
a
matter
of
common
agreement,
so
far
as
manufacturer's
market
is
concerned
that
that's
what
we're
now
talking
about.
geographically,
we
all
agree
that
it's
nationwide.
and
there's
no
reason
to
discuss
that
any
further.
in
terms
of
the
product
or
line
of
commerce,
the
district
court
found
that
the
relevant
market
was
for
men's
shoes,
women's
shoes
and
children's
shoes.
and
i
turn
to
the
question
in
a
moment
whether
those
findings
are
supported
by
the
elements.
it
seems
to
me
important
first
to
direct
our
minds
and
little
bit
to
the
question
of
what
are
we
looking
for
and
why
are
we
looking
for
it.
when
we
talk
about
line
of
commerce
or
market,
as
i
see
it,
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
it
could
be
the
test,
if
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
you
must
have
to
make
the
case
a
substantially
--
a
tendency
to
lessen
competition
in
the
line
of
commerce
and
in
the
section.
i
don't
know.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes.
but,
i
would
also
think
that
if
you
had
the
whole
country,
a
fortiori
you
had
it
in
the
section.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
but
if
one
has
a
nationwide
manufacturer's
market,
then
he
has
satisfied
the
“section
of
the
country”
required.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
might
ask,
your
honor,
to
defer
that
until
we
come
to
talk
--
about
the
retail
markets
because
it
makes
more
sense
in
connection
--
if
we're
talking
about
retail
competition,
i
will
address
myself
to
it
at
the
end.
i'm
now
talking
--
mr.
archibald
cox
to
sell.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suggest
that
if
you
have
a
market
defined
in
a
term
of
line
of
commerce
that
extends
to
every
section,
it
necessarily
is
a
line
of
commerce
in
some
section.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
my
answer,
your
honor,
which
i
think
meets
the
point
is
that
we
have
agreement
here
that
so
far
as
manufacturers
are
concerned,
they
are
competitors
in
selling
all
around
the
country.
and
that
therefore,
we
don't
need
to
consider,
so
far
as
the
manufacturers
are
concerned,
the
question
that
you
raised.
now,
we
do
need
to
consider
it
in
terms
of
retailing
but
i
wonder
if
i
might
--
can
take
it
up
to
that
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
it's
a
matter
of
--
it's
a
matter
of
fact
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
would
say
--
we
would
say
that
this
case
does
not
involve
that
question,
but
yes,
it
would
be
within
the
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
we
would
say,
following
the
implicit
holding
in
the
maryland-virginia
milk
producers
case
that
a
metropolitan
area,
such
as
you
mentioned,
may
be
a
section
of
the
country.
their
holdings
under
the
sherman
act
saying
that
tying
up
movie
chains
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
metropolitan
areas.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
quiet
true.
now,
in
the
retailing
and
in
this
case,
we
have
the
further
fact
that
there
are
--
not
15,
but
a
141
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
wonder
when
one
considers
whether
what
congress
was
concerned
with,
was
getting
something
of
national
importance,
then
it
does
not
become
material
unless
one
puts
a
very
literal
meaning
on
the
word
“section”
that
you
have
cities
scattered
all
over
the
country.
the
alternative
as
justice
stewart
suggested
earlier
would
be
to
say
that
section
7
does
not
apply
to
retail
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
because
all
the
markets
are
retail
markets.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i've
--
again
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
sir.
the
only
difficulty
i'm
having
frankly
is
that
this
is
irrelevant
to
the
point
we're
talking
about,
manufacturers
because
they
don't
sell
in
single
cities.
when
we
come
to
the
retail
combination,
then
they
do
and
while
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
rude
or
presuming.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
would
progress
far
more
clearly
if
we
could
talk
about
manufacturing
for
while,
the
issues
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
let
me
defer
my
argument
with
respect
to
manufacturing
then
and
turn
to
the
retailing
portion
of
it
and
then
try
to
deal
with
this
point
because
i
think,
we
should
deal
with
it
in
the
context
in
which
it
arises.
now,
here
i
pointed
out
earlier
that
brown
had
become
a
significant
factor
in
the
retail
market.
and
that
kinney
was
also
the
largest
and
most
aggressive
independent
retail
chain.
kinney
had
the
eighth
largest
volume
of
sales
in
the
entire
industry.
it
had
as
i
said
before,
352
stores
in
315
cities.
the
district
court
found
that
kinney
and
brown
were
competitors
in
the
retailing
of
shoes.
and
perhaps,
i
should
emphasize
again
that
i
have
turned
to
the
retail
market
and
the
horizontal
effects
of
the
merger.
i
hope,
i
will
have
time
to
come
back
to
the
other.
that
testimony
that
kinney
and
brown
were
competitors
in
the
retailing
of
shoes
is
supported
by
a
large
number
of
detailed
facts.
there's
evidence
that
there
were
138
cities
of
over
10,000
population
in
which
brown
and
kinney
both
had
stores.
in
the
123
of
those
138
cities,
the
stores
were
located
within
two
blocks
of
each
other.
in
58
cities,
there
was
a
kinney
store
and
the
wohl
department
within
two
blocks.
and
in
eight
cities,
kinney
and
regal
had
stores
within
two
block
of
subject,
of
course,
to
qualification
that
you
make
that
they
weren't
competitors
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
would
--
so
they
would
be
competitors
in
men's
shoes,
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
that's
true.
yes.
the
product
--
and
so
far
as
the
evidence
showing
the
competition
in
addition
to
location,
they
sell
generally
men's,
women's
and
children's
shoes
in
these
stores.
there
are
some
specialists
but
in
general,
in
all
stores,
either
shall
sell
men's
shoes,
women's
shoes,
or
children's
shoes.
there
was
testimony,
for
example,
that
in
the
men's
line,
that
brown's
pedwin
and
kinney's
men's
shoes
were
very
similar
in
price,
style,
and
appearance
and
very
competitive.
i
point
out
that
48%
of
brown's
sales
of
men's
shoes
and
42%
of
kinney's
sales
were
in
the
$7
to
$10
price
bracket.
with
respect
to
women's
shoes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
48%
of
brown's
sales
of
men's
shoes
and
42%
of
kinney's
sale
of
men's
shoes
were
in
to
$7
to
9.99
price
bracket,
i
think
i
said
$10.
similarly,
there
were
lines
of
brown's
women's
shoes
--
air
steps,
life
strides,
glamour
debs,
which
were
competitive
with
the
shoes
sold
by
kinney.
27%
of
brown's
women's
shoes
and
35%
of
kinney's
were
within
the
$3
bracket,
about
$4
to
$7.
and
among
children's
shoes,
the
figures,
without
taking
time
to
read
them
were
substantially
the
same.
in
addition
to
the
overlap
on
prices,
one
of
the
most
persuasive
testimonies
in
my
mind
was
the
repeated
testimony
from
my
--
string
of
retailers
in
perhaps
40
of
the
--
or
more
of
these
cities,
testifying
from
their
actual
experience
that
their
stores
were
competitive
with
brown
and
kinney's.
sometimes,
it
would
be
a
brown
retailer
and
he
testified
that
kinney
was
his
competitor.
one
finds
such
expressions,
as
i
took
kinney
shoes
off
the
soles
of
my
customer.
people
told
me
that
they
had
been
shopping
down
at
kinney
and
they
were
coming
up
in
the
street
and
shopping
here.
there
was
testimony
from
the
brown
and
kinney
executives
which
corroborates
this.
brown
said
that
it
aimed
to
the
middle
income
and
what
we
call
the
lower
price
market.
and
kinney
defined
its
market
as
the
middle
income
and
lower
income
group
of
america.
and
the
--
mr.
dean
in
his
brief,
stresses
wide
divergence
in
merchandising
methods,
style,
advertising,
and
the
like,
but
of
course,
when
you're
selling
differentiated
products
today,
those
are
the
heart
of
competition
rather
than
evidence
of
a
lack
of
competition.
now,
i
come
to
the
application
of
section
7.
and
again
to
the
key
phrase,
first,
whether
the
effect
of
the
acquisition
maybe
to
substantially
lessen
competition.
at
first,
it
seems
to
me
necessary
to
find
the
market,
both
geographically
and
in
terms
of
the
product
or
line
of
commerce.
in
terms
of
the
line
of
commerce,
the
district
court
found
that
the
retail
products
were
or
lines
of
commerce
were
men's,
women's
and
children's
shoes.
now,
i
point
out
that
the
evidence
shows
that
this
is
the
way
the
trade
is
organized.
this
is
the
way
retailers
speak
to
themselves,
they
sell
men's
shoes,
they
sell
women's
shoes.
the
stores
are
either
men's,
women's
or
children's
or
family
shoe
stores.
again,
showing
the
way
the
industry
is
organized.
and
brown's
own
organization
heads
up
to
executives
in
charge
of
those
branches.
it's
true
that
there
can
conceivably
be
finer
divisions
by
style
and
price
but
the
district
court
found,
following
the
testimony
that
they
were
quite
impracticable.
in
the
first
place,
he
had
testimony
from
retailer
witnesses
--
live
witnesses
that
the
high
prices
do
compete
with
the
low
prices.
he
had
evidence
of
an
interchangeability
of
users
nor
is
this
one
dramatic
instance
was
the
president
of
brown
came
in
to
testify
one
day,
wearing
what
were
called
dress
shoes
and
the
next
day,
he
came
in
to
testify
wearing
casual
shoes
which
underscored
the
point
that
these
classifications
do
not
really
indicate
the
uses
or
lack
of
competition.
they
are
manufacturers'
selling
gadgets
for
the
most
part.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
trust
that
it
wasn't
the
casual
when
he
wore
the
second.
there
was
also,
as
i
said,
before
direct
testimony
from
the
retailer
witnesses,
all
of
which
is
outlined
in
our
brief.
now
the
district
court
found
that
geographically,
the
market
at
retail
is
the
city
and
the
immediate
surrounding
and
contiguous
area.
there,
again,
he
had
testimony
of
witnesses
describing
what
was
the
market,
and
there
are
40
out
of
the
138
cities.
and
i
think
that
this
is
indisputably
a
fair
sample.
anyone
who
suggests
that
the
others
of
the
138
or
somehow,
that
unique,
surely
has
the
burden
to
do
it
and
the
appellants
called
that
no
--
called
one
live
retailer
witness.
there
were
good
many
experts
and
many,
many
statistics
but
only,
if
my
memory
is
right,
one
live
witness.
the
government's
expert
testified
that
normally
you
find
85
to
90
of
the
sales
in
marketing
concentrated
in
the
city.
and
the
court
reviewed
the
detailed
evidence
about
saint
louis
and
found
that
there,
also
of
course,
a
retailer
on
one
side
of
the
city
does
not
compete
with
a
retailer
way
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
but
still,
they're
in
competition
with
each
other
all
the
way
along
the
line
with
theirs
in
the
middle
in
competition
with
those
on
either
side
of
him
and
that
therefore,
the
most
practical
line
was
the
city.
the
question
then
arises
whether
despite
the
fact
that
the
practical
market
is
the
city
and
it's
immediately
surrounding
area.
this
qualifies
as
a
“section
of
the
country.”
as
i
understand
the
appellant's
argument
to
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
adverting
or
the
question
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
mentioned,
it
is
in
two
parts.
first,
is
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggesting
the
statute
did
take
out
the
word
“in
any
community”
and
uses
simply
the
term
“in
any
section
of
the
country.”
and
the
contention
is
made
that
that
signifies
that
a
city
cannot
be
qualified
as
a
section
of
the
country
and
as
the
justice
said,
“well,
you
can't
add
a
lot
of
separate
discrete
cities
and
get
a
section.”
then
the
other
point
on
which
appellant
relies
in
this
connection
is
the
testimony
of
mr.
kelley
who
was
general
council
of
federal
trade
commission
who
at
one
point
said
the
combination
of
department
stores
in
new
york,
this
was
in
testifying,
would
not
violate
the
proposed
bill.
he
later
indicated
that
new
york
city
might
be
a
market.
this
was
only
testimony
and
it
seems
to
me
that
no
very
firm
conclusions
can
be
predicated
about
it
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
--
that
is
true
and
it
is
also
--
i
can't
direct
myself
to
significant
--
mr.
archibald
cox
all
i
meant
to
dispose
of,
if
i
may
put
it,
is
this
kelley's
testimony.
now,
i'm
coming
to
the
change
in
the
language.
it's
unquestionably
true
that
this
was
intended
to
make
possible
some
mergers
between
little
fellows
that
section
7
would
have
forbidden
before.
and
the
day
the
example
was
given
in
the
senate
report,
that
the
use
of
the
term
“community”
stirred
a
storm
of
controversies
since
it
was
argued
the
act
was
worded
might
go
so
far
as
to
prevent
any
local
enterprise
in
the
small
town
from
buying
up
a
local
enterprise
the
same
time.
as
the
consequence,
the
word
“community”
was
dropped
from
subsequent
versions
of
the
bill.
now,
i
think
that
one
way
of
stating
the
question
is
whether
there
to
indicate
that
any
combination
in
a
town
or
a
city
or
even
in
a
succession
of
towns
or
cities
is
exempt
from
the
bill.
we
say
not.
we
say
first,
that
one
must
consider
the
substantial
and
meaningful
problem
that
is
addressed
to
not
only
in
the
terms
of
the
congressional
amendment
in
1950
but
that
we're
considered
with
here.
we're
concerned
with
actual
markets
reflecting
business
dealings.
market
such
as
that
economists
or
businessmen
would
choose
regardless
of
the
verbal
geographical
definition
as
the
area
of
effective
competition.
and
one
of
our
troubles
is
--
well,
let
me
back
up
just
a
little,
we
think
this
is
entirely
clear
not
only
for
the
common
sense
that
you've
got
to
deal
with
business
markets,
business
practice
but
also,
is
--
it's
revealed
that
this
is
a
question
from
a
legislative
history
in
the
right
approach.
the
reported
sales
said,
“what
constitutes
a
section
will
vary
with
the
nature
of
the
product
owing
to
the
differences
in
size
and
character
of
markets.
it
would
be
meaningless
from
an
economic
point
of
view
to
attempt
to
apply
for
all
products
a
uniform
definition
of
section,”
but
such
definition
were
based
on
miles,
population,
income
or
any
other
unit
of
measurement.
the
section
which
would
be
economically
significant
for
a
heavy
durable
product
such
as
large
machines
tools
might
be
meaningless
for
a
light
product
such
as
milk
which
certainly
sounds
in
terms
of
a
retail
consumers
market.
and
of
course
was
so
applied
although
this
court
didn't
pass
on
the
point
in
the
virginia-maryland
milk
producers
case.
then
it
went
on
as
the
supreme
court
stated
in
standard
oil
company
against
u.s.
since
it
is
the
preservation
of
competition
which
is
at
stake,
the
significant
proportion
of
coverage
is
that
within
the
area
of
effective
competition.
and
it
did
went
on
in
the
report
in
very
much
those
terms,
so
that
we
think
our
practical
businessman
or
economist
as
the
expert
put
it,
definition
of
market,
is
the
decisive
thing
here.
now,
someone
may
say
in
reply,
“well,
what
effect
are
you
giving
then
to
taking
the
word
“community”
out?”
and
i
would
say,
“we
were
giving
two
effects”.
one
is
that
the
bill
would
longer
be
applicable
to
a
merger
between
two
little
fellows
in
a
single
little
town,
that
before
a
city
can
qualify
as
a
section,
it
must
be
sizable
enough
to
have
some
interstate
or
national
significance.
mr.
archibald
cox
when
i
said
interstate,
i
didn't
mean
that
i
should
have
confined
myself
to
national
and
not
used
the
word
interstate.
it
wasn't
--
i
didn't
mean
to
emphasize
across
state
line.
i
meant
that
it
was
of
national
importance.
second,
we
think
in
this
case
that
it
is
permissible
to
consider
the
fact
that
not
just
one
retail
trade
area
is
included
but
that
a
number
of
retail
trade
areas
are
included.
the
138,
by
our
computation
and
according
to
the
evidence
because
the
question
after
all
must
have
been
whether
the
lessening
of
competition
in
a
line
of
commerce
was
of
enough
importance
for
congress
to
take
note
of
it.
the
argument
that
a
single
city
and
its
environment
cannot
be
a
section
would
prove
too
much.
it
would
prove
that
there
was
no
intention
to
have
this
amendment
applied
to
retailing
at
all.
and
that
is
of
the
slightest
evidence
that
that
was
the
--
in
the
mind
of
congress
or
was
the
purpose.
in
other
words,
i
think
in
what
my
argument
comes
to
in
the
obstacle
i
have
to
get
over
is
that
if
you
can
add
these
together,
the
section
is
not
something
with
a
single
outline
on
the
map.
it
becomes
more
a
functional
concept,
a
concept
of
importance
to
the
whole
country
rather
than
a
matter
of
drawing
a
line
on
the
map
that
could
be
called
a
section.
mr.
archibald
cox
they're
scattered
all
over.
mr.
archibald
cox
they're
scattered
all
over
the
country
whether
they're
--
and
every
one
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
depend
a
little
bit
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
they're
all
over
the
country.
there's
no
--
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
in
the
--
it's
--
the
expression
is
in
the
passage
i
read
just
a
minute
ago.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
report
says
two
things.
first,
it
said
that
it
did
not
wish
to
impede
mergers
between
two
little
concerns
in
a
single
town.
mr.
archibald
cox
second,
it
goes
on
as
set
forth,
i
read
it
at
pages
79,
80
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
on
pages
79
and
80
of
our
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
like
now,
if
i
may,
because
i
think
that
is
simply
a
point
that
i
can't
add
to
the
test
that
we
got
over,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
say
is
consistent
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
in
light
of
its
purposes.
i
would
like
now,
if
i
may,
to
go
back
to
the
question
of
the
vertical
combination
between
one
of
the
dominant
firms,
manufacturing
facilities
and
the
major
independent
remaining
outlet
in
the
country.
i
had
pointed
that
the
outlet
buys
1.7%
of
all
men's
shoes,
1.5%,
i
think
it
is
of
all
the
children's,
and
a
smaller
percentage
of
--
no,
i
got
it
wrong
--
1.7
of
women's,
1.5
of
children's
and
a
much
smaller
percentage
of
all
men's
shoes.
the
claim
is
that
by
putting
these
together,
brown
is
foreclosing
selling
opportunities
for
other
manufacturers
and
thus,
substantially
lessening
competition
in
the
manufacturer's
market.
now,
they
sell
all
over
the
country,
this
problem
about
“section
of
the
country”
does
not
arise
in
connection
with
the
manufacturers'
market.
with
respect
to
what
is
the
appropriate
line
of
commerce,
i
suggest
that
before
looking
at
the
evidence,
we
consider,
why
does
one
look
at
the
line
of
commerce?
and
the
reason
as
i
see
it
is,
is
that
it
bears
out
of
the
section
of
substantiality.
substantiality
is
a
matter
of
relative
as
well
as
absolute
size.
and
to
determine
the
relative
size
of
the
kinney
market,
you
have
to
decide
in
what
line
of
commerce
or
what
market
set
kinney
sells.
so
that
the
--
so
the
question
of
line
of
commerce
in
this
part
of
the
case
boils
down
to
the
question,
“what
is
the
market
in
which
kinney
purchases?”
the
similarities
and
differences
between
brown's
production
and
kinney's
production
which
cover
pages
of
the
appellant's
brief
are
utterly
irrelevant
because
we're
concerned
with
the
vertical,
not
a
horizontal
merger.
now,
this
one
other
respect
in
which
the
distinctions
between
brown's
production
and
kinney's
purchases
in
terms
of
style,
price
and
so
forth,
may
be
important.
the
differences
may
bear
on
the
extent
to
which
brown
can
fill
kinney's
needs.
and
that
in
turn,
of
course,
would
bear
on
the
question
whether
this
may
substantially
lessen
competition.
but
in
terms
of
the
market
in
which
kinney
buys,
i
simply
submit
that
if
you
look
at
the
range
in
which
kinney
buys,
which
you
will
conclude
that
the
only
possible
way
of
describing
it
is
men's,
women's
and
children's
shoes
that
it
covers
such
a
broad
price
range,
the
figures
are
in
the
brief,
that
there
isn't
any
other
way
of
putting
it
and
that
the
propriety
of
doing
that
is
emphasized
by
the
testimony
i
mentioned
earlier
about
what
ultimately
happens
on
the
retail
and
after
the
shoes
were
passed
through
kinney.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
you
would
find
that
kinney
buys
1.3.
indeed,
the
government's
original
argument
was
that
you
should
take
shoes
in
general.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
rejected
and
it
was
narrow.
of
course,
i
should
say
that
i
don't
quite
understand
why
mr.
dean
wishes
to
narrow
the
line
of
commerce.
if
he
does,
he
hasn't
ever
stated
what
his
line
of
commerce
is
because
the
more
you
narrow
the
line
of
commerce,
while
you
may
find
that
this
little
effect
in
some
lines,
you
will
find
that
there's
a
much
bigger
effect
in
others.
for
example,
if
you
said
that
the
line
of
commerce
involved
here
was
women's
shoes
to
the
middle
and
low
income
groups,
that
kinney's
proportion
would
rise
a
great
deal,
so
would
brown's
because
neither
of
them
sells
the
expensive
shoe.
and
if
you
narrow
it
down
to
a
particular
price
line,
you
will,
without
taking
the
time,
find
some
price
line
in
which
kinney
has
not
1.7%
of
the
women's
shoes
but
3%
of
the
women's
shoes,
and
brown
could
make
them.
and
the
statute
says,
“in
any
line
of
commerce”
so
that
while
we
think
that
the
district
court's
findings
were
right,
we
think
that
any
narrowing
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
we
had
a
stronger
case
with
respect
to
some
particular
line
although
not
to
others.
so
i
come
then
to
the
question
whether
the
combination
is,
one,
the
effect
of
which
maybe
to
lessen
competition.
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
this
is
in
terms
of
function
just
like
the
du
pont
general
motors
case,
and
the
thesis
here
is
much
like
the
thesis
in
the
du
pont
general
motors
case,
it
rest
as
was
in
the
columbia
steel
case
upon
the
very
high
probability
that
a
subsidiary
will
deal
only
with
its
parent
for
goods
that
the
parent
could
fragment.
and
what
the
other
manufacturers
in
the
industry
are
concerned
about,
the
government
is
considered
about
is
that
brown
will
take
over
these
markets.
now,
can
brown
manufacture
the
shoes
needed
by
kinney?
in
the
first
place,
i
should
point
out
that
the
tables
in
the
back
of
the
appellant's
briefs
are
highly
misleading,
if
they
are
intended
to
bear
on
this
point
--
if
you
would
turn,
for
example,
to
page
7
(a),
the
next
to
the
last
page
in
mr.
dean's
main
brief,
you
will
find
that
he
has
set
forth
the
percentage
distribution
of
brown's
production
--
using
brown's
at
the
various
price
ranges,
using
brown's
production
as
the
total
universe
and
the
percentage
distribution
of
kinney
purchases
using
all
kinney's
purchases
as
the
total
universe.
with
comparing
percentages
with
percentages,
doesn't
give
you
any
indication
worthwhile
at
least
of
the
extent
to
which
brown's
volume
of
production
are
types
of
shoes
it
produces
are
such
as
kinney
would
normally
find.
take
for
example,
just
about
in
the
middle
of
the
chart,
the
manufacturers'
price
range,
--
$5.40
down
to
$4.81.
and
the
figures
set
forth,
there
are
18.9%
of
brown's
production
is
in
that
range
and
31%
of
kinney's
purchases
are
in
that
range.
now,
if
you
use
absolute
numbers,
brown
produces
640,000
pairs
of
shoes,
men's
shoes
other
than
work
in
that
range
and
kinney
buys
113,000.
so
brown
can
make
all
the
shoes
kinney
would
want
in
that
price
range
so
far
as
price
range
is
bare
on
this,
without
any
convergence
or
change
whatsoever.
this
is
one
illustration.
others
are
equally
dramatic,
others
show
that
brown
could
make
only
part.
measured
by
the
existing
overlap
at
1955
prices,
brown
could
supply
35%
of
the
men's
shoes
needed
by
kinney,
30%
of
the
women's
shoes
and
50%
of
the
children's.
but
we
think
the
figures
should
be
pushed
a
great
deal
higher
than
that.
in
the
first
place,
brown
can
adapt
its
production
to
kinney's
needs.
it's
makeup
division,
which
mr.
dean
tells
us
he's
losing
money,
sold
19,000,000
shoes
in
1950
and
34,000,000
shoes
in
1956.
apparently
there,
he
could've
possessed
in
losing
money
as
they
thought
it
would.
the
makeup
division
is
the
one
that
sells
manufacturers'
other
brands.
brown
opened
18
new
factories
between
1945
and
1955.
when
you
open
a
new
factory,
of
course,
you
have
a
chance
to
put
in
new
machinery
and
to
hire
a
new
work
force
and
this
problem
of
piece
rates
doesn't
get
involved
at
all.
it
made
13
major
changes
in
machinery
in
the
five
year
period,
1951
to
1955,
again,
this
sort
of
thing
that
lends
itself
to
the
adaptation
of
your
production
facilities
to
your
market.
and
there
was
from
manufacturers,
a
great
deal
of
--
well,
there
was
testimony
--
ample
testimony
that
supports
for
the
district
court's
finding
that
manufacturers
are
able
to
convert
their
production
to
somewhat
different
lines
up
or
down.
it
is
true
that
the
habits
of
workers
in
working
at
a
certain
piece
rate
tend
to
impose
some
restraint
provided
you
don't
open
a
new
factory
or
put
in
entirely
new
machinery.
but
at
the
same
time,
as
these
manufacturers
explain,
there
are
ways
and
terms
of
the
kind
of
material
you
used,
the
way
you
have
cut
it,
and
other
ways
of
manufacturing
for
a
particular
market.
furthermore,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
drawing
together
to
train
brown's
price
ranges
at
kinney's
because
kinney
was
beginning
to
upgrade
as
it
went
into
the
suburban
markets.
and
brown
was
also
seeking
to
emphasize
the
new
markets
in
the
suburban
areas.
and
in
those
areas,
their
lines
would
naturally
tend
to
merge
without
any
convergence
of
the
machineries.
would
brown
take
over
kinney's
purchases?
well,
we
know
something
about
what
would
happen
from
the
past.
brown
had
acquired
other
firms.
the
appellants
at
page
188
of
their
brief
make
a
good
deal
of
the
fact
that
when
brown
purchased
wetherby-kayser,
wetherby-kayser
kept
on
purchasing
from
other
manufacturers.
they
set
forth
their
purchases
from
other
manufacturers.
no,
i
guess
their
total
purchases
and
down
below
it,
the
purchases
from
other
manufacturer.
you
might
be
interested
in
writing
in
under
the
purchases
from
all
manufacturers.
the
purchases
from
brown,
28,801
in
1951,
before
the
merger,
23,144
in
1952,
the
year
of
the
merger,
137,958
in
1953,
after
the
merger,
1954,
i
can't
find,
1955,
282,000
in
1957.
in
other
words,
wetherby-kayser's
purchases
from
brown
in
those
five
years
increased
10
fold
whereas
the
purchases
as
a
total
had
only
doubled,
so
that
there's
a
marked
tendency.
i
pointed
out
just
before
the
recess
in
answer
to
a
question
from
justice
whittaker
that
this
same
kind
of
thing
had
happened,
when
brown
took
over
wohl.
wohl's
total
purchases
between
1950
and
1957
increased
60%.
wohl's
purchases
from
brown
increased
from
2,800,000
to
12,000,000
or
320%.
brown
had
been
in
1950,
doing
it
quickly,
something
more
than
10%
of
wohl's
total
purchases
and
it
increased
to
something
more
than
33%
of
wohl's
total
purchases.
in
our
brief,
we
have
pointed
out
that
there
was
the
same
drawing
together
of
purchases
and
sales
between
companies
within
the
unit
when
brown
took
over
regal.
now,
so
far
as
kinney
is
concerned,
brown
is
taking
over
the
kinney
purchases.
and
i
think
that
in
measuring
their
effect,
one
should
note
first
that
this
isn't
the
beginning
of
the
merger
and
second
that
this
has
been
a
litigation
all
the
time.
nevertheless,
brown
had
made
no
sales
to
kinney
prior
to
the
merger.
the
next
year,
8%
of
all
kinney's
purchases
came
from
brown.
brown
had
already
become
kinney's
largest
single
supplier.
adding
what
had
happened
in
the
case
of
other
firms,
to
what
had
happened
in
the
beginning,
in
the
case
of
kinney,
and
to
the
probabilities
that
a
manufacturer
would
use,
so
far
as
possible,
it's
own
captive
outlet.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
certainly
fair
to
conclude
here
that
there
will
be
a
tendency
for
brown
to
foreclose
the
kinney
market
to
other
manufacturer.
now,
this
is
isn't
just
something
that
we've
thought
of.
the
president
of
brown
in
buying
kinney
had
this
very
thing
in
mind.
he
was
asked
when
he
was
testified
that
what
was
your
primary
purpose
in
acquiring
the
stock
of
kinney's.
it
was
our
feeling
in
addition
to
getting
a
distribution
into
a
field
of
crisis
which
we
were
not
covered,
was
also
the
feeling
that
if
kinney
moved
into
shopping
centers
in
these
freestanding
stores,
they
were
going
into
a
higher
income
neighborhood.
and
they
would
probably
find
the
necessity
of
upgrading
and
adding
additional
lines
to
their
very
successful
operation
that
they
have
been
doing.
and
it
would
give
us
an
opportunity
we
hope
to
be
able
to
sell
them
in
that
category.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
page
1323
of
the
record.
we
hope
to
be
able
to
sell
them
in
that
category,
and
this
was
stated
in
answer
to
the
question,
“why
did
you
acquire
kinney?”
it's
on
that
evidence
that
we
think
that
the
court
was
amply
justified
in
finding
that
this
may
tend
to
lessen
competition
in
manufacturers'
selling
opportunities.
then
we
come
to
the
question
whether
the
segment
of
the
market
is
foreclosed.
1.7%
in
the
case
of
women's
shoes,
about
that
for
children,
and
less
for
men's,
is
substantial.
what
is
substantial
is
of
course
not
simply
a
quantitative
method.
but
i
think
that
it's
worth
pointing
out
that
we
are
talking
about
6.4
million
pairs
of
shoes
a
year
at
a
cost
of
$16,000,000
almost
$17,000,000.
this
acquisition,
since
substantiality
is
a
matter
of
relative
size
as
well
as
absolute
size,
was
an
acquisition
by
one
of
the
giants.
it
would
have
a
considerable
effect
at
other
manufacturers.
kinney's
purchases,
just
to
indicate
this,
equal
to
the
total
output
of
the
seventh
ranking
firm.
it's
the
production
--
it
equals
the
production
of
12
average-size
manufacturers
in
the
industry.
now,
of
course,
that
isn't
the
way
the
sales
were
distributed
and
it
doesn't
take
the
loss
of
all
your
production.
virtually,
to
ruin
a
manufacturer.
if
you
assume
that
the
sudden
loss
from
a
tenth
to
a
fifth
of
the
manufacturers'
market
we're
enough
to
a
very
seriously
injury,
and
that
kinney's
sales
were
distributed,
somewhat
that
way,
the
number
affected,
if
all
kinney's
purchases
were
taken
over
by
brown
would
come
into
at
least
65
or
100
of
the
remaining
manufacturers
in
the
industry.
note
too,
that
this
is
in
an
industry
in
which
the
market
is
already
trending
to
our
concentration.
the
number
of
plants
operated
by
the
big
four
went
up
35%
in
the
period
1950
to
1956.
the
number
of
plants
operated
by
brown
rose
62%.
the
five
largest
manufacturers
had
already
acquired
19
independent
manufacturers.
between
1947
and
1954,
the
number
of
independent,
i
guess
i
pointed
this
out
this
before,
had
declined
10%,
and
from
1954
to
1958,
another
10%.
this
easy
entry
to
the
industry
is
theory.
it
was
an
unanswered
question,
the
united
shoe
company
witnesses
were
not
able
to
testify
to
more
than
one
or
two
people
who
had
entered
and
they'd
been
backed
before
1950.
i
wonder,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
might
have
just
two
minutes
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
finish
off
this
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that's
all
it
will
take.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
processes
of
vertical
integration
were
already
narrowing
the
market
for
independent
manufacturers.
between
1950
and
1955,
the
big
six
manufacturers
had
purchased
13
retail
chains
with
13,000
outlets.
between
1948
and
1954,
i'm
sorry
these
jumped
around
so
in
the
years
but
those
were
the
figures
that
were
available,
the
percentage
of
stores
owned
by
chains
with
101
stores
or
more
increased
62%
so
that
by
the
time
of
the
merger,
they
constituted
33%
of
all
shoe
stores,
again,
evidence
of
the
concentration
of
buying
power
in
the
manufacturer's
market.
the
franchise
program
was
growing
very
rapidly,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier.
between
1945
and
1956,
the
big
six
manufacturers
increased
their
own
owned-and-operated
outlets
and
this
leaves
out
the
franchise
dealers
from
14,000
to
38,000,
a
170%
increase.
other
manufacturers
were
pursuing
this
same
policy.
indeed,
one
of
the
basic
problems
is
that
this
is
a
self-feeding
reaction.
when
brown
who
had
been
selling
shoes
in
los
angeles
through
the
(inaudible),
found
that
the
(inaudible)
had
been
bought
up
by
one
of
the
other
big
manufacturers,
brown
rushed
in
and
bought
wetherby-kayser.
when
florsheim
was
brought
up
by
one
of
the
other
three
big
manufacturers,
brown
rushed
in
and
bought
up
regal.
and
indeed,
the
nature
of
this
interplay
or
chain
reaction
was
explained
by
brown's
president
in
a
statement
in
1955,
which
i
think
chose
that
this
process
is
likely
to
continue
unless
it
is
stopped
here.
my
view
point
can
pretty
well
be
summed
up
like
this,
“one
of
our
objectives
in
acquiring
retail
stores
is
to
protect
and
guarantee
distribution
of
our
products
in
areas
where
independent
retailers
could
not
give
our
brands
adequate
distribution
because
of
their
affiliations
with
other
branded
manufacturers.”
the
gist
of
the
case,
as
we
see
it,
is
that
when
you
take
this
trend,
that
if
is
allowed
to
continue
that
this
market
will
cease
to
be
open
and
competitive
to
all
manufacturers
and
characterized
by
a
lot
of
small
manufacturers
and
that
in
this
industry,
the
opportunities
for
the
small
businessmen,
as
unhappily
they
have
in
others,
will
be
lost.
now,
i
would
just
stress
one
sentence
and
that
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
other
point
which
i
won't
take
time
to
emphasize
in
full,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
when
you
note
the
effect
through
the
vertical
integration
in
the
manufacturers'
market
and
note
the
effect
of
the
horizontal
integration
in
the
retail
market,
and
add
them
together,
that
they
then
concentrate
economic
power
and
give
the
combination
a
leverage,
a
power
in
the
market
that
puts
everyone
else,
those
independent,
at
such
a
disadvantage
that
even
if
they
were
not
a
violation
of
section
7,
looking
at
these
things
independently,
the
total
effect
would
most
surely
be
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition.
and
all
we
have
to
show
is
that
it
may
substantially
lessen
competition.
now
those
advantages
are
outlined
in
our
brief,
and
i
think
really,
i
shouldn't
address
this
any
longer
on
the
court's
time.
thank
you.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
you're
correct.
