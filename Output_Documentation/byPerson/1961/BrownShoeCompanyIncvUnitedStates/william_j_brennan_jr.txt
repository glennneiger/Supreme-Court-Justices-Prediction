mr.
dean,
have
you
suggested
yet
what
were
the
economic
motivations
for
brown's
acquisition
of
kinney?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
that
sense
then,
was
acquisition
to
hedge
against
possible
loss
of
the
markets
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
independent
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
that
the
composition
meet
at
--
by
which
i
mean
the
material
to
go
to
make
up
the
product
that
kinney
sells
quite
different
from
the
material
which
ought
to
make
up
the
product
that
brown
sells.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
i
may
rephrase
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
then
you
would
say
there
never
could
be
a
violation
of
section
7
unless
at
least
they
were
within
the
same
price
range.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
dean
but
is
--
but
there's
an
outright
order
of
the
--
or
an
order
of
outright
divestiture.
i
thought
the
reservation
was
in
respect
with
nothing
except
details
of
the
plan
of
the
divestiture,
isn't
it,
the
reservation
from
more
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
construction
or
carrying
out
of
this
final
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
construction
or
carrying
out
of
the
final
judgment
which
in
paragraph
4
is
an
order
--
a
decree
of
divestiture.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
when
in
relation
to
the
merger
where
this
proceeding
begun?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
wasn't
(inaudible),
it
was
careful.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

is
now
only
of
production,
manufacturing?

stopped

justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
it's
that
whole
list
of
retailers?
is
that

william
j.
brennan,

manufacturers.
