mr.
arthur
h.
dean
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
brown
shoe
company,
the
appellant
from
a
judgment
of
the
eastern
district
court
in
missouri
rendered
by
the
late
judge
webber
in
december
1959.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
he
passed
away
mr.
judge
--
justice
whitaker
just
a
week
or
so
ago.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
he
died
very
suddenly
just
about
a
week
or
10
days
ago.
the
brown
shoe
company
which
is
--
i
will
describe
--
whose
business
i
will
describe
in
just
a
moment,
acquired
by
merger
the
g.r.
kinney
company.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
was
that
the
acquisition
by
brown
of
kinney
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
as
was
amended
in
1950.
section
7,
as
the
court
is
well
aware
provides
that
if
as
a
result
of
any
acquisition
and
any
line
of
commerce,
in
any
section
of
the
country
or
the
effect
maybe
to
substantially
lessen
competition
depends
--
the
acquisition
is
in
violation
of
the
statute.
we
believe
that
the
district
court
was
in
error
in
regard
to
the
lines
of
commerce,
it
selected.
the
sections
of
the
country
it
concluded
existed
in
shoe
retailing
and
it's
appraisal
of
the
effect
of
the
acquisition
upon
the
lessening
of
competition.
i
would
like
first
to
describe
to
the
court
the
operations
of
the
two
firms
and
the
type
of
business
in
which
each
of
them
were
engaged,
the
results
on
competition
as
set
forth
in
the
evidence
and
then
go
to
the
--
what
the
district
court
held.
some
of
you
who
--
many
years
ago
who
read
funny
papers
may
recall
buster
brown
and
his
dog
tige.
this
was
for
many
years,
the
trademark
of
the
brown
shoe
company,
although
the
company
itself
has
founded
under
the
name
of
brown
in
1878.
the
--
most
of
the
evidence,
most
of
the
--
of
the
statistical
evidence
in
the
record
is
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
october
31,
1955.
in
that
year,
the
brown
shoe
company
produced
some
25,600,000
pairs
of
shoes.
the
national
production
was
642,507,000
so
that
brown
had
roughly
4%
of
the
national
production
in
pairs
of
shoes.
for
that
period,
it
was
the
fourth
largest
manufacturer
in
the
united
states
in
leather
shoes.
as
the
court
will
see
as
i
go
on
i
am
going
to
draw
some
of
distinction
between
leather
shoes
and
rubber
soled
upper
--
where
the
uppers
are
made
of
canvass
which
is
also
a
very
fast
growing
part
of
the
shoe
business.
the
kinney
company,
the
company
that
was
acquired
by
brown
in
this
period
ending
in
1955
produced
2.9
million
pairs
out
of
the
642
odd
million
pairs.
in
other
words,
the
kinney
company
had
four-tenths
of
1%
of
the
national
production
of
shoes.
so
that
together,
as
far
as
the
production
of
leather
shoe
is
concerned,
after
the
acquisition,
brown
and
kinney
produced
4.4%
of
the
national
production.
the
district
court
conceded
that
as
far
as
the
manufacturing,
effects
on
competition
of
the
manufacturing
was
concerned,
it
was
only
slight
and
i
believe
that
the
government
in
its
brief
has
conceded
that
the
effect
on
competition
as
far
as
production
is
concerned
is
very
slight.
let
me
turn
now
to
--
to
go
from
the
production
of
shoes
to
the
shoe
retailer.
brown
has
been,
for
many
years,
primarily
a
manufacturer
of
shoes.
starting
some
time
in
this
country
before
--
after
the
turn
of
the
century,
there
began
to
be
experienced
by
local
merchants,
a
competition
in
various
cities
of
the
so-called
chain
store.
so
that
the
big
function
of
the
chain
store
as
far
as
the
consumer
is
concerned
is
to
try
it
to
give
a
good
quality
merchandise,
not
necessarily
at
least
in
the
merchandising
field,
but
the
highest
quality,
in
tremendous
volume
could
cut
out
the
wholesaler,
cut
out
the
jobber,
could
cut
out
the
middleman
to
try
to
carry
on
his
--
the
business
at
a
very
low
rate
of
profit
per
unit
of
sale
and
to
try
to
pass
these
benefits
on
to
the
consumer.
brown
had
built
up
its
manufacturing
business
in
the
medium
price
field,
which
i
will
tell
you
in
dollar
terms
in
just
a
moment.
they
bought
the
highest
grade
materials
in
every
respect.
they
taught
their
workman
to
produce
the
highest
quality
shoes
in
every
respect
and
they
advertised
their
shoes
under
national
brand
names
in
national
magazines
and
they
sold
and
still
continue
to
sell
the
bulk
of
their
production
through
some
7000
independent
dealers
to
whom
they
sell
these
shoes
at
wholesale.
now
brown
has
endeavored
to
help
all
of
these
7000
independent
dealers
to
compete
with
the
so-called
retail
chains
by
advising
them
with
respect
to
their
inventories,
their
methods
of
merchandising,
their
methods
of
stocking
shoes,
their
methods
of
advertising
and
their
methods
of
pricing.
they
have
tried
to
bring
to
these
7000
independent
local
retail
dealers
by
advising
them
how
to
compete
with
these
retail
shoe
chains.
now
the
most
successful
of
the
retail
shoe
chains
are
not
integrated
with
any
manufacturer.
the
three
largest
and
most
successful,
the
sears
roebuck
in
its
retail
store,
it
also
sells
shoes
by
mail
order
but
in
in
its
retail
stores,
shoes
--
sears
does
not
own
any
manufacturing
facilities.
the
second
largest
is
edison
brothers,
again,
does
not
own
any
manufacturing
facilities.
j.c.
penney
then
there
are
very
large
--
the
largest
outlet
west
to
the
mississippi
is
in
the
famous
bar
and
store
in
st.
louis,
again,
it
does
not
own
manufacturing
facilities.
then
there
are
great
outlets
in
new
york,
in
macy's
and
marshall,
chicago,
marshall
field
and
other
leading
department
stores,
but
the
most
successful
of
the
chain
stores
selling
at
retail
are
not
themselves
integrated
with
the
manufacturer.
brown
found
that
it
could
not
sell
its
manufactured
shoes
where
it
used
only
the
best
quality
materials
and
tried
to
have
only
the
best
quality
workmanship
because
the
chains
wanted
to
sell
their
own
brand
of
shoes
and
they
weren't
interested
in
the
national
brands
and
they
also
wanted
to
sell
shoes
at
a
price
so
that
the
--
these
big
retail
chains
buy
their
shoes
made
up
to
their
own
specifications.
they
select
the
materials,
select
the
workmanship
and
buy
these
shoes
to
sell
at
a
price.
now
in
order
to
help
some
of
these
7
odd
thousand
independent
dealers
to
whom
brown
sold
in
an
effort
to
help
these
independent
merchants
compete
better
with
these
retail
chains,
brown
set
up
the
so-called,
“brown
franchise
plan.”
now,
each
of
the
people
operating
on
this
brown
franchise
plan
are
completely
independent
dealers.
they
have
their
own
capital.
they
select
their
own
store.
they
hire
their
own
employees.
they
buy
their
own
stock.
they
handle
their
own
merchandiser.
they
run
these
stores
entirely
for
their
own
account,
for
their
own
profit
and
loss
account.
what
brown
does
is
to
send
out
experts
in
order
to
help
these
people
in
the
display
of
shoes
in
the
window,
in
the
layout
of
the
store.
they
teach
these
independent
retailers
that
in
order
to
compete
with
the
retail
chains
that
you've
got
to
render
service
and
that
you
have
to
lay
in
a
complete
stock
in-depth
of
each
style
of
shoe
and
you
have
to
be
able
to
sell
the
customer
in
each
size
and
in
each
width.
one
of
the
ways
that
some
of
the
chains
are
able
to
cut
down
on
their
operating
expenses
is
that
they
don't
stock
12
months
out
of
a
year
all
shoes.
they
buy
these
shoes
from
these
manufacturers
to
meet
their
specifications
and
some
of
the
chains
only
stocked
shoes
in
the
most
popular
sizes
or
they
may
stock
them
only
in
two
widths
whereas
brown
tries
to
teach
its
dealers
that
the
way
to
compete
is
to
have
a
stock
of
each
style
in-depth,
in
each
size
and
in
its
width
and
to
pay
attention
to
the
fitting
and
the
comfort
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
--
of
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
these
--
there
are
some
11,000
manufacturers
of
shoes
in
the
united
states
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
some
of
these
people
on
contract
supply
shoes
to
these
retail
chain
stores
according
to
their
specifications.
these
--
most
of
these
retail
chain
stores
sell
this
out,
as
i
come
to
you
in
a
minute
and
give
you
the
dollar
prices,
selling
what's
called
the
popular
price
field.
most
of
the
independent
retailers
to
whom
brown
sells,
sell
in
a
price
above
the
popular
price
field
and
what's
called
the
medium
price
fields.
there's
about
--
at
various
community
here,
there's
about
10%
to
15%
of
brown's
business
which
has
not
been
profitable
for
it
where
it
make
shoes
to
specifications.
and
i
think
that
to
that
where
they
make
shoes
to
specifications,
those
shoes
come
at
competition
on
a
manufacturing
level
where
the
shoes
are
sold
to
these
retail
chains.
it
is
our
contention
as
i
shall
try
to
develop
that
the
shoes
--
that
brown
manufactures
and
sells
to
these
independent
dealers
in
this
medium
price
range
are
not
in
competition
with
the
shoes
in
the
popular
price
range
which
is
ranging
almost
entirely
in
which
kinney,
the
company
that
brown
acquired
sold.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well,
in
the
popular
price
range
in
--
which
is
the
--
which
is
the
price
range
that
most
of
the
retail
shoes
sell
in,
the
popular
price
range
for
men's
is
$8.99
retail
and
down.
for
women's
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
that
--
no,
i'm
getting
you
the
popular
price,
brown
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
--
the
independent
dealers
to
whom
brown
sells
sell
in
the
medium
price
range
which
i
will
give
you
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
--
in
a
minute.
if
i
may,
i'll
give
them
to
you
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
--
in
terms
of
men's,
women's,
and
children's
popular
price
and
then,
men's,
women's,
children's
medium
price.
and
the
popular
price
range
for
men's
is
$8.99
and
down,
in
women's,
it's
$5.99
and
down,
in
children's,
it's
$3.99
and
down
and
the
medium
price
range
which
is
range
that
brown
sells
the
bulk
of
its
shoes,
the
men's
shoes
are
$8.95
and
above,
roughly
to
$14.95.
the
women's
are
$5.99
and
above
or
$7.95
and
above
and
the
children's
are
$5.45
and
above.
i
shall
describe
later
the
--
we
have
some
testimony
on
the
record
where
we
took
the
medi
--
the
medium
prices
of
the
shoes
sold
in
the
brown
independent
dealers
and
those
sold
in
the
kinney
popular
price
and
will
show
you
that
in
a
large
number
of
these
cities,
the
prices
of
the
--
these
independent
dealers
to
whom
brown
had
sold
are
anywhere
from
150%
to
200%
higher
than
the
medium
prices
in
kinney
and
by
medium
prices
is
you
take
the
gross
sales
and
divide
half
in
the
lower
half
and
the
other
in
the
upper
half.
i
might
just
say
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
the
number
--
the
evidence
is
somewhat
varying
in
the
record
as
to
the
actual
number
of
shoe
manufacturers
in
the
united
states,
the
united
states
shoe
manufacturing
company
which
is
you
know
leases
shoe
(inaudible),
testified
that
it
had
about
a
thousand
customers
on
its
account.
according
to
the
census
figures,
these
--
although
we
i
think
these
figures
are
inaccurate
there
has
been
some
decrease
in
the
total
number
of
shoe
manufacturers.
now,
in
addition
to
selling,
if
i
may
go
back
to
describe
the
brown's
retailing
again,
in
addition
to
selling
to
this
--
about
85%
of
its
shoes
that
it
manufactures
are
sold
at
wholesale
to
these
some
7000
dealers,
it
sells
about
20%
of
this
85%,
these
independent
dealers
on
the
franchise
plan.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
there's
635
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
--
franchise
dealers
out
about
7000
independent
dealers.
now
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes,
it
does
sir.
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
--
it's
been
up
to
650,
625.
i
think
in
1955,
it
was
about
635
but
it
fluctuates
every
week.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
they're
--
they're
cancellable
at
any
times
and
anybody
can
leave
the
brown
franchise
plan
but
almost
invariably,
the
records
shows
that
they
--
they
remained
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
--
customer
of
brown's.
there
is
no
requirement
that
an
independent
dealer
stay
on
the
brown
franchise
plan.
there
is
no
--
some
of
them
buy
as
much
as
40%
of
their
shoes
from
others,
i
think
the
average
is
about
25%
shoes
from
others.
what
brown
does
is
to
attempt
to
get
these
people
to
concentrate
on
a
single
line
of
shoes,
brown's
in-depth,
so
that
they
won't
have
--
be
charging
two
or
three
lines
and
then
have
to
mark
it
down
at
the
end
of
the
season
then
suffer
loss.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
they're
not
tied
to
brown
shoes
in
the
sense,
they
agreed
that
they
will
concentrate
on
brown
shoes
but
they're
free
to
leave
the
brown
plan
at
anytime.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
some
of
them
buy
as
much
as
40%.
i
think
on
the
average,
they
buy
about
25
%
from
the
others,
other
manufacturers.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
they
are.
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
brown
retails
it
shoes
in
--
in
three
other
ways.
in
order
to
help
young
men,
young
men
who'd
been
generally
speaking,
the
assistant
managers
or
managers
in
other
stores
who
want
to
start
out
on
their
own,
brown
through
its
wholly
own
subsidiary,
the
wohl,
it's
w-a
--
w-o-h-l
shoe
company
has
the
so-called
wohl
plan
and
there
a
young
man
who
has
from
$30,000
can
open
up
a
shoe
store
and
brown
will
set
him
those
shoes
on
consignment
and
he
remits
after
he
takes
out
his
salary,
the
proceeds
of
those
shoes
sold
after
expenses.
that
constitutes
about
2%
of
brown's
wholesale
sales.
that's
called
the
wohl
plan.
those
shoes
are
sold
at
wholesale
to
this
young
man
starting
out
in
business
as
independent
dealers.
now,
in
addition,
the
wohl
shoe
company
and
this
is
a
fairly
common
thing
in
the
merchandising
of
shoes
in
department
stores,
many
department
stores
find
that
the
merchandising
of
shoes
is
a
very
complicated
business
and
they
lease
their
shoe
departments
so
that
they're
not
operated
by
the
store
itself
and
wohl
operates
100
departments
and
some
163
independent
department
and
specialty
stores
throughout
the
united
states.
the
--
in
these
department
stores
or
wohl
generally
speaking
has
no
written
agreements.
they
are
cancellable
at
anytime
by
the
department
store
owner
and
the
merchandising
policy
has
to
conform
to
the
department
store.
in
these
leased
departments,
wohl
concentrates
on
women's
shoes
and
generally
in
both
the
medium
price
line
and
in
lines
higher
than
the
medium
price
line,
that
is
higher
than
$14.95.
some
of
the
shoes
sold
by
wohl
in
these
leased
departments
grow
up
as
highest
$25
--
$32.
in
addition
wohl
itself
operates
some
18
family
shoe
stores
and
nine
women's
shoe
stores.
brown
has
one
other
subsidiary
the
regal
shoe
company
which
both
manufactures
shoes
as
plan
as
equipment
massachusetts
and
has
a
retail
store
mostly
on
the
eastern
seaboard.
these
two
subsidiaries,
the
wohl
shoe
company
and
the
regal
shoe
company,
both
subsidiary
of
brown,
together
sold
about
1.1%
of
the
$37
million
combined
sales
of
shoe
--
of
footwear
sold
at
retail
in
this
year
1955
out
of
$3,464,000,000.
now
let
me
turn
from
a
moment
to
kinney,
the
company
that
was
acquired.
kinney
was
primarily
a
retailer.
it
did
some
manufacturing,
but
its
manufacturing
was
not
very
important.
kinney
was
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
so-called
integrated
manufacturing
and
retail
shoe
stores
and
in
1929
to
1930,
it
got
into
great
financial
difficulties
because
as
i
shall
develop
later,
it
is
quite
impossible
for
a
manager
of
a
shoe
store,
especially
a
shoe
store
selling
women's
shoes
which
are
--
where
the
styles
change
very
rapidly
and
where
you
have
to
be
completely
au
courant
of
what
perhaps
may
be
the
latest
style
of
shoe
worn
and
the
latest
texture
by
the
most
prominent
star,
apparently
manufacturing
part
of
kinney
is
trying
to
force
on
the
retail
stores
the
shoes
that
they
manufacture
and
they
almost
went
bankrupt
in
trying
to
do
it.
as
a
result,
kinney
decreased
the
emphasis
on
manufacturing
and
tried
to
build
up
generally
in
family
areas
and
generally
in
the
very
low
price
field
lower
than
this
medium
field
in
which
the
brown
sells
and
they
developed
stores
in
some
315
cities.
now,
kinney
is
a
family
shoe
store,
by
that
i
mean
it
caters
to
all
members
of
the
family
and
pairs
it
sold
in
1955
in
children
shoes
51%,
in
women's
shoes
35%,
and
in
men
40%,
in
other
words
it
has
sold
in
that
year
about
1.2%
of
the
national
retail
footwear
sales.
as
i
had
just
said
wohl
and
regal
sold
about
1.1,
sold
at
retail,
brown
and
kinney
sold
together
about
2.3%
of
the
national
footwear
retail
sales.
now,
i
want
to
be
clear
that
the
lower
court
found
that
these
brown
franchise
dealers,
some
635
out
of
the
7000
independent
dealers,
all
he
found
that
they
used
their
own
capital
and
--
and
run
these
stores
for
their
own
profit
and
loss,
nevertheless,
in
his
finding
to
which
we
take
exception,
he
included
the
retail
sales
of
these
brown
franchise
dealers
and
these
wholesale
sales
on
this
wohl
plan
account,
he
included
those
as
though
they
were
actually
retail
outlets
of
brown.
now,
from
a
competitive
standpoint,
they
are
not.
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
companies
like
edison
brothers,
one
of
the
most
successful
of
women's
retail
chains
is
that
they
separate
their
stores
into
three
classes.
but
if
they
find
that
sales
are
depressed
in
one
area
because
of
economic
conditions,
they
can
move
shoes
from
say
philadelphia
to
washington
or
washington
to
boston
or
boston
to
chicago.
you
cannot
do
that
with
these
independent
dealers.
each
of
these
independent
dealers
buy
themselves
as
he
pleases
with
his
own
capital
at
his
own
profit
and
loss.
so
we
believe
and
i
think
the
economic
evidence
supports
us
that
the
retail
sales
of
these
independent
dealers
should
not
be
regarded
as
retail
sales
to
brown.
they
also
think
that
to
do
so,
completely
distorts
the
economic
evidence
because
otherwise
the
wholesale
sale
of
brown
to
these
independent
dealers
is
included
and
then
the
retail
sales
are
included
so
--
and
then
the
factory
sales
will
be
included
twice.
these
sales,
combined
sales
of
wohl
and
regal
would
be
$78
million
out
of
3.5
billion.
as
i
said,
brown
started
primarily
as
a
manufacturer,
it
sold
to
these
independent
retailers
in
this
medium
price
range
which
the
men's
were
$8.95
to
$14.95,
women's
$7.95
to
$14.95
and
children's
$5.45
to
$7.95
and
they
tried
it
every
way
to
help
these
sales
to
independent
dealers.
now,
there
is
no
difference
in
the
terms
on
which
brown's
sales
are
made
to
these
7000
independent
dealers
and
those
on
the
franchise.
those
on
the
franchise
get
no
better
credit
terms.
they
got
no
greater
discounts.
they
get
no
greater
payrolls
than
any
independent
dealer
buying
from
brown.
there
is
at
one
time,
brown
tried
to
organize
a
group
life
insurance
for
some
of
these
franchise
dealers.
and
i
think
about
400
of
the
635
still
have
it,
although
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
because
of
the
vast
extension
of
group
life
to
whether
its
--
practically
any
organization
has
it
today
that
there's
any
benefit
in
having
it
and
then
in
the
wohl
plan,
these
--
the
insurance
features
of
the
wohl
plan
were
cancelled
because
they
couldn't
prove
any
economic
benefit
to
dealer,
either
from
the
group
life
or
the
fire
insurance.
brown
is,
as
a
retailer,
through
its
wohl
subsidiary,
sells
80%
of
women's
shoes,
and
sells
men's
shoes
through
its
regal
subsidiary.
the
regal
subsidiary
has
never
been
profitable.
in
contrast
to
the
brown
independent
dealers,
selling
these
nationally
advertised
branded
shoes,
so
when
the
customer
comes
in,
he
having
had
a
pair,
being
satisfied
with
them,
he
asks
for
that
pair
of
shoes
which
he's
had
before
and
which
he
knows
by
name.
in
the
kinney
outlets,
they
do
not
have
any
national
advertising.
they
do
not
sell
national
brands.
in
contrast
to
the
--
to
the
wohl's
operations
in
leased
departments
where
there
are
charge
accounts,
where
there
is
delivery,
where
there's
a
liberal
plan
of
return.
in
the
kinney
retail
outlets,
it's
entirely
cash
and
carry.
there
is
little
service.
the
shoes
are
carried
generally
only
in
the
popular
sizes
and
then
only
in
two
widths.
they're
the
popular
or
low
priced
family
shoes.
for
the
men
shoes,
i
say
again,
they're
$8.99
and
down,
for
the
women's
$5.99
and
down
and
children's
$3.99
and
down.
80%
of
the
shoes
sold
in
the
kinney
retail
stores
are
made
by
independent
manufacturers.
starting
about,
shortly
after
the
end
of
world
war
ii
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware,
there
was
a
great
trend
from
the
cities
where
many
of
the
shoe
store
outlets
were
located
to
in
the
suburbs
and
about
this
same
time
with
the
passage
of
the
40-hour
week
law
banks
and
a
great
many
business
establishments
closed
their
offices
on
saturdays.
prior
to
that
time
there
was
a
very
common
occurrence
or
families,
the
wife
and
the
children
to
come
in
and
have
lunch
with
the
husband
on
saturday
and
do
the
shopping
in
the
downtown
city
areas
on
a
saturday.
with
this
great
access
to
the
suburbs
with
this
40-hour
a
week,
the
husband
no
longer
in
many
instances
comes
in
to
town
on
a
saturday.
as
a
result,
there
has
grown
up
in
the
united
states
several
types
of
shopping
centers.
some
of
these
shopping
centers
are
very
vast,
they're
very
large.
they
have
free
parking.
you
can
get
practically
anything
from
medical
service
or
dental
service
or
optical
service
or
clothes
to
shoes.
others
are
--
are
neighbor
--
neighbor
parking
centers
within
three
or
four
minutes
driving.
these
centers
have
revolutionized
the
merchandising
of
shoes.
the
shoe
store
that
brown
had
near
the
stock
exchange
that
used
to
do
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
the
business
per
annum.
with
the
stock
exchange
and
banks
and
offices
closed,
they
were
doing
practically
nothing.
so
that
kinney
went
--
decided
to
try
to
go
out
and
get
locations
in
these
suburban
shopping
centers.
they
also
have
built
what's
called
free
standing
stores.
there
is
one,
a
kinney
store,
northeast
of
washington
in
rockville,
maryland
where
they
build
these
stores
right
out
on
the
highways,
but
no
buildings
on
either
side
as
parking
lot
and
where
you
can
--
put
your
shoes
out
on
the
racks
and
the
customer
selects
the
shoes
and
the
clerk
just
fits
them
and
wraps
them
up.
so
kinney
started
in
on
this
--
trying
to
get
these
outlets.
in
order
to
get
these
outlets,
you
have
to
contract
for
them
several
years
ahead
because
the
insurance
companies
make
the
loans
to
the
buildings
and
they
want
a
lease
signed
at
that
time.
kinney
didn't
have
the
necessary
capital
because
of
some
restrictions
in
the
step
financing.
the
common
stock
was
owned
by
a
relatively
small
group
who
wanted
no
more
common
sold
and
brown,
which
did
not
previously
had
any
outlets
in
this
lower
price
field
and
which
was
becoming
concerned
about
whether
there
could
be
a
re-urbanization
of
the
urban
centers,
felt
that
these
retail
outlets,
especially
on
these
suburban
centers
offered
a
possibility
of
going
in
to
this
field.
now
let
me
be
clear
brown
did
not
think
that
it
was
going
to
sell
any
of
the
shoes
that
it
manufactured
to
kinney.
now,
the
reason
for
that
is
very
clear.
once
you
have
trained
your
work
to
do
--
use
the
best
possible
workmanship
as
the
evidence
shows
brown
does
and
once
you
have
graduated,
a
workman
to
hire
quality
workmanship,
smaller
stickers.
they
get
paid
more
as
they
go
up
in
the
quality
of
their
work
and
the
wages
go
up,
it
is
almost
impossible
to
teach
a
workman
whom
you've
trained
for
several
years
to
do
the
best
quality
of
workmanship,
to
do
medium
quality
of
workmanship
and
also
it
means
that
he
lowers
his
pay
so
that
in
a
few
times
that
brown
and
its
like
business
carriers
has
tried
to
take
orders
for
the
manufacturing
of
a
lower
price
shoe,
not
with
the
brand
name.
it
--
have
they
have
not
been
profitable,
they
have
had
difficulty
with
their
workmen
and
brown
now
knows
that
it
is
utterly
possible
for
it
to
manufacture
in
its
factories
a
kind
of
shoe
which
kinney
can
have
manufactured.
now
there
is
an
almost
constant
entry
into
the
shoe
manufacturing
business.
you
can
lease
your
equipment.
you
can
get
contracts
from
this
retail
chains
who
don't
have
manufacturing
facilities
of
their
own.
there
are
many
communities
which
will
build
you
or
give
you
a
factory,
tax
free
for
some
period
of
time.
there
is
a
great
ease
of
entry
into
the
shoe
manufacturing
business
and
therefore,
kinney
wants
to
be
free
in
its
retailer,
that's
to
be
able
to
buy
where
--
were
it
leases,
whatever
styles
it
wants
and
at
whatever
prices
economic
conditions
might
make
necessary
at
the
time.
so
that
there
is
no
possibility
i
believe
on
an
economic
standpoint,
any
feasible
economic
standpoint
of
brown
being
able
to
increase
its
sales
of
manufactured
shoes
to
kinney.
that
was
not
the
intent
of
the
merger.
it's
economic
--
not
the
economic
purpose
of
the
merger
and
i
think
the
economic
evidence
will
clearly
show
that
that
cannot
come
about.
now,
there
had
been
some
small
sales
of
brown
to
kinney,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
sales
of
kinney
from
outside
people
have
increased.
there
wasn't
a
single
witness
who
testified
that
he
believed
that
he
--
a
single
manufacturer
who
testified
that
he
believed
that
he
would
be
displaced
as
a
supplier
of
kinney
by
brown,
not
a
single
one.
there
isn't
--
there
isn't
one
word
of
evidence
in
the
entire
record
from
anyone
indicating
any
possibility
that
the
present
suppliers
of
kinney
or
the
suppliers
of
kinney
in
the
future
will
be
displaced
by
brown.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
--
yes
please
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
as
far
as
the
--
there
is
a
--
which
i
think
the
government
would
admit
that
we
--
we
say
that
the
court,
there
--
there
are
several
figures
that
the
court
uses
and
i
think
there's
a
typographical
error
in
the
court's
opinion
because
the
evidence
is
quite
clear
that
brown
manufactured
4%
and
the
kinney
manufactured
four-tenths
of
1%.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well,
let
me
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
let
me
come
to
that
specific
point
the
exception
that
we
take
to
the
findings.
it
is
our
contention
that
at
retail
shoes
are
retailed
in
different
communities.
i
think
you
would
readily
agree
that
a
woman
or
a
person
living
in
falls
church
would
not
normally
go
to
hyattsville
to
purchase
their
shoes.
i
mean
they
normally
go
to
some
place
that's
within
five
or
ten
minutes
or
certainly
20
minutes
driving
time
from
where
they
live.
the
court
took
some
141
cities.
there
isn't
anything
in
the
evidence
to
indicate
why
he
took
those
41
cities
--
141
cities.
he
took
cities
of
over
10,000
and
the
immediately
contiguous
area.
he
--
it
isn't
clear
from
his
opinion
whether
each
of
the
141
cities
and
the
immediately
contiguous
area
is
a
section
of
the
country
within
the
meaning
of
section
7
or
whether
the
141
cities
and
the
immediately
contiguous
area
in
the
aggregate
is
the
section
of
the
conflict.
there
is
no
--
that's
not
clear
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
his
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
we
--
we
contend
mr.
chief
justice,
we
introduced
evidence
from
the
census
that
what
the
census
calls
the
standard
metropolitan
area
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
--
which
is
derived
by
statistics
from
place
that
has
common
--
people
commonly
go
to
market
without
regard
to
political
bounds
and
the
government
contended
that
you
should
take
only
the
political
boundaries
of
a
particular
place
without
regard
to
where
that
particular
city
do
trade
from
the
county
or
the
surrounding
area.
the
court
apparently
didn't
take
either
one.
the
court
said,
he
took
cities,
these
141
cities
and
this
immediately
contiguous
area,
but
he
didn't
say
what
he
meant
by
the
immediately
contiguous
area.
as
far
his
finding
is
concerned,
you're
quite
correct
for
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
he
said
that,
“wherever
there
was
a
kinney
retail
outlet
or
a
--
anybody
operating
on
the
brown
franchise
plan
or
the
wohl
plan
in
the
city
of
new
york,
they
were
in
competition
with
each
other.
thus
a
store
in
staten
island,
its
11
miles
by
ferry
and
subway
from
a
store
in
the
bronx
would
be
in
competition
with
each
other
because
they'd
be
within
the
same
city.”
we
maintain
that
the
entire
evidence
is
to
the
contrary.
we
had
professor
joe
dean.
i
wish
i
could
claim
him
as
a
relative
but
i
can't,
of
columbia
who
testified
as
to
the
economic
significance.
his
--
none
of
his
testimony
is
mentioned.
we
had
a
mr.
apple,
who
was
a
well-recognized
authority
on
marketing
often
used
by
the
united
states
government
who
testified
that
there
were
various
areas
in
the
city
of
st.
louis
where
kinney
itself
didn't
have
a
retail
outlet.
he
said
that
he
had
to
divide
these
areas
up
for
those
within
five
minutes
driving
time
or
20
minutes
driving
time
where
the
larger
shopping
centers
and
that
something
at
one
end
of
the
city
of
st.
louis
as
far
as
retail
was
concerned
would
not
be
in
competition
with
another.
the
court
disregarded
all
of
that
testimony
and
held
that
every
retail
outlet
was
in
competition
with
every
other
retail
outlet.
he
disregarded
style,
price,
quality
or
type
of
merchandise
and
he
simply
divided
all
shoes
into
three
classes,
men's
shoes
women's
shoes
and
children's
shoes.
he
lumped
apparently
in
the
children's
shoes,
infant's
shoes
which
brown
manufactured
and
kinney
did
not.
young
miss'
shoes
and
boy's
shoe,
although
obviously
a
growing
boy
couldn't
wear
a
growing
girl's
shoes.
he
lumped
in
to
this
--
there's
half
a
dozen
categories
in
boy's
shoes,
youth
shoes,
growing
girl's
shoes,
miss'
shoes
and
the
shoe
trade
that
are
well-recognized.
he
threw
those
all
apparently
in
the
children's
shoe.
he
completely
disregarded
all
of
the
economic
testimony
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
people
rarely
go
out
of
the
price
range.
he
--
we
also
and
we
believe
the
economic
evidence
supports
us
in
this
that
in
determining
your
line
of
commerce
that
you
have
to
determine
it
realistically
on
the
basis
of
the
purpose
for
which
a
person
is
going
to
buy
a
shoe
at
the
time
he
purchases
it.
he
disregarded
that
because
he
said
a
person
could
one
day
buy
a
shoe
as
a
dress
shoe
and
several
years
later
after
it
was
worn
out
it
might
be
used
for
gardening,
but
we
submit
that
on
the
evidence
and
from
a
standpoint
of
determining
what
is
proper
competition
that
you
have
to
determine
the
use
as
between
the
two
types
of
shoes
as
of
the
time
of
purchase
and
not
what
you're
going
to
do
with
it
when
you
wear
it
out.
he
therefore
disregarded
all
of
the
--
of
the
different
classes
of
shoes
which
are
very
common
and
well-standardized
and
well-understood
in
shoe
retailing
and
which
are
fundamental
part
of
shoe
retailing.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
sir.
yes,
i'd
be
very
glad
to
give
that
to
you.
if
i
may
go
back
just
a
minute
more
on
these
prices
in
these
retail
areas,
this
is
covered
in
our
main
brief
at
page
88
and
to
90.
testimony
was
introduced
with
respect
to
some
58
cities
and
the
merchandising
of
these
shoes
of
retail
was
broken
down
in
age
and
sex
categories
that
is
men's
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
no
sir,
we
took
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
our
expert
took
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
our
expert
took
58
cities
which
he
regarded
as
representative.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
and
we
took
again
this
standard
metropolitan
area
of
the
census
and
we
broke
them
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
they
raised
--
mr.
justice
clark
in
--
from
medium
sized
cities
up
to
fairly
large
cities.
i
can
give
you
the
list
of
the
cities
if
you'd
like.
they
were
regarded
by
this
merchandising
expert
as
fairly
representative
cities
where
you'd
find
the
representative
competition
in
these
--
between
these
various
categories.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
the
judge
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes,
judge
weber
took
a
141,
each
city
of
over
10,000
and
the
immediately
contiguous
or
surrounding
area.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
sir.
other
than
this
qualification
of
10,000
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
--
and
above
yes
--
yes.
well
let
me
say
he
took
these
141
cities
where
he
thought
there
was
competition
in
that
there
was
a
kinney
retail
outlet
and
any
independent
dealer
operating
under
the
brown
franchise
plan
or
city
where
wohl
was
operating
a
leased
department
store.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
that
is
right.
i
think
i
can
give
you
in
the
transcript
of
the
record
in
volume
14
at
page
7317
there
is
an
alphabetical
listing
of
the
overlapping
areas.
they
start
out
with
altoona.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
7317
in
volume
14
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
you'll
see
that
those
cities
go
from
such
cities
as
altoona,
pennsylvania,
decatur,
illinois,
glens
falls,
new
york,
little
rock,
arkansas,
meridian,
mississippi,
muncie,
indiana,
pottsville,
pennsylvania,
south
bend,
indiana,
tulsa,
oklahoma,
williamsport,
pennsylvania
and
fort
worth,
texas.
wherever
there
was
an
overlap,
i
understand
you
to
say
the
judge
found
that
that's
perceived
through
competitions.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes,
he
said
that
--
he
said
that
--
to
be
precise,
he
said
that
they
sold
in
varying
percentages
but
he
said
these
percentages
are
or
could
become
substantial
and
he
said,
“if
you
take
--”
--
he
said
anything
in
effect
over
--
the
2%
is
more
than
1%
and
therefore,
he
said
anything
that
adds
to
that
which
you
have
is
or
could
be
substantial.
now,
i
don't
think
anybody
would've
disagreed
that
2%
is
more
than
1%
but
i
think
the
issue
before
the
court
is,
doesn't
meet
the
test
of
substantiality
in
section
7.
to
give
you
the
precise
figures
mr.
justice
frankfurter
on
the
number
of
manufacturing
firms
in
the
transcript
page
1637,
this
is
according
to
the
census.
in
1947,
they
were
1077.
in
1954,
they
were
970
and
in
1958,
there
were
872,
but
there
has
been
an
increase
of
well
over
--
from
506,000,000
pairs
in
1947
to
643,000,000
pairs
in
1955.
from
1939
through
1956,
the
production
share
of
the
largest
four
has
been
constant.
it's
been
23.2%,
that's
in
a
table
in
our
main
brief
at
page
50.
now,
the
share
of
the
next
largest
(inaudible)
above
the
four
to
the
largest
45
have
declined,
but
the
shares
of
the
smaller
manufacturers
above
these
eight
to
--
up
to
the
largest
50
have
increased
by
5.8%.
now
the
court
seemed
to
feel
--
the
lower
court
seemed
to
feel
that
there
was
an
inexorable
trend
towards
mergers
or
inexorable
trend
towards
manufacturers
acquiring
retail
outlets,
but
the
evidence
is
quite
contrary.
furthermore,
if
you
would
take
into
consideration
the
growth
in
canvass-upper
rubber
soled
shoes
which
has
increased
from
24
million
pairs
in
1947
to
125
million
pairs
in
1961,
the
four
largest
shares
would
be
way
down.
now,
there'd
been
various
shifts
within
these
groups
but
within
the
first
four,
their
aggregate
has
been
about
23.2
and
brown
has
changed
from
3.86
to
3.99.
now,
there
has
been
a
great
--
on
this
question
of
ease
of
entry
there
were
two
companies
that
entered
the
shoe
manufacturing
business
for
the
first
time
in
1940,
the
sudbury
company
which
has
become
the
ninth
largest.
they
started
in
1940
and
today
they're
ninth
largest
and
the
georgia
which
started
in
1940
and
is
today
the
25th
largest.
now,
there
is
no
economy
or
manufacturer
in
these
--
in
these
large
factories.
some
of
the
companies
including
brown
set
up
factories
of
20,000
a
day
and
they
found
that
they
had
to
go
back
to
more
medium
sized
establishments
that
they
were
more
efficient
and
that
again
is
something
that
makes
free
of
entry.
you
can
lease
your
machinery
and
there
are
no
patents
or
technological
barriers
and
there
really
isn't
a
competitive
production
challenge.
there's
also
been
an
enormous
increase
in
shoe
imports.
some
--
from
1954
of
6
million
they've
gone
in
1960
to
121
million
in
pairs,
from
$10
million
to
115
millions
of
dollars.
and
this
question
of
the
--
that
seemed
to
concern
the
court
so
much
below
that
the
independent
retailer
would
not
be
able
to
compete
with
the
retail
outlets
owned
by
manufacturers,
our
brief
shows
on
that
table
23,
that
--
that
type
of
distribution
is
only
7%
in
dollars
and
5%
in
pairs.
now,
there
are
some
70,000
outlets
--
shoe
outlets
in
retail
in
the
united
states,
some
70,000.
you'll
find
through
the
testimony
the
figure
22,000
shoe
stores
that's
because
in
the
census,
they
only
include
for
statistical
purposes
a
shoe
store
something
which
has
over
50%
of
its
sales
in
shoes.
as
i
said
earlier,
the
big
retailers
of
sears
with
$104
million,
edison
brothers
with
87,
and
penney
with
85
and
montgomery
(inaudible)
at
41,
are
retail
chains
but
they
don't
have
manufacturing
facilities
and
the
department
stores
again
which
don't
have
manufacturing
facilities
sell
11%
and
these
independent
stores,
the
independent
retailers
still
sell
about
49%
of
the
shoes
sold
in
the
united
states
at
retail
so
that
no
single
shoe
retailer
has
any
large
share
of
the
market.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well,
actually
i
think
the
evidence
is
mr.
judge
frankfurter
that
these
big
retail
stores
who
don't
have
manufacturing
facilities
at
least
set
the
pace
in
style.
the
big
people
in
the
shoe
retailing
are
sears
and
edison
brothers
and
penney
and
western
mississippi
river,
famous
bar
in
st.
louis
and
macy's,
marshall
field
or
jordan
marsh,
people
like
that,
they're
the
one's
who
really
set
the
pace.
now,
bro
--
brown
has
been
a
--
brown
has
been
a
middle
of
the
road,
honest
material,
honest
workmanship,
good
quality
for
the
money
shoe
manufacturer.
it
is
not
trying
to
cheapen
its
shoe
to
go
on
the
low
price
field
and
it
hasn't
tried
to
go
on
the
high
price
field.
it's
trying
to
give
an
honest
product
for
an
honest
dollar.
and
it
has
strived
to
help
the
vast
bulk
of
the
independent
retailers
who
buy
from
it
at
wholesale
to
continue
to
sell
this
type
of
shoe
to
the
american
public
in
competition
with
these
chain
stores
who
can
buy
from
any
manufacturer
at
a
price
or
any
style
or
by
a
certain
number
so
that
i
think
it's
--
as
far
as
the
styling
is
concerned
and
as
far
as
the
vast
amount
of
the
merchandising
it
is
concerned,
i
think
it
is
these
chain
retail
stores
without
manufacturing
connections
who
probably
set
the
style.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
many
of
them
are.
international
as
manufactures
under
brands.
some
of
their
famous
brands
are
florsheim.
there's
nettleton
and
nunn
bush
and
various
others
who
sell
--
endicott-johnson
sells
under
its
own
name.
general
shoe
company
sells
under
--
their
trademark
is
the
jarman
shoe.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
sir.
the
district
court
did
not
refer
to
that
at
all
in
his
opinion.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
many
years
ago
it
was
mr.
justice
stewart
and
then
it
gave
up
their
retail
store
is
un
--
as
unprofitable.
they
bought
wohl
--
this
wohl
on
the
leased
department
and
shoe
stores
and
this
wholesale,
wohl
plan
account
and
then
they
later
bought
regal.
regal
--
wohl
is
primarily
women's
shoes.
regal
is
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
--
men's
shoes.
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
it
had
sell
--
sold
to
these
independent
retailers
on
the
brown
franchise
plan
but
it
had
no
retail
outlets
of
its
own.
it
was
--
it
was
i
think
this
competition
in
this
shoe
retailing
has
changed
enormously
by
the
advent
of
the
chain
retail
shoe
stores,
by
the
movement
to
the
suburbs
and
the
population
growth
and
by
the
40-hour
week
and
the
development
of
these
suburban
shopping
centers
and
the
--
or
relative
decrease
and
importance
of
the
downtown
shopping
areas.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
no.
they
--
they
were
--
they
started
before
world
war
ii
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
they
--
this
--
the
chain
retail
stores
started
well
before
world
war
ii
but
they
came
into
prominence
in
the
earliest
1930's
because
with
the
decrease
in
the
economic
income
and
the
fact
that
they
were
selling
shoes,
perhaps
of
lower
quality,
but
nevertheless
selling
shoes
at
the
vast
reduction
in
price
meant
that
the
sales
of
the
chain
stores
went
up
and
they
--
for
the
quality
that
they
sold
were
rendering
a
great
service
to
the
consumer
and
taking
a
far
or
less
percentage
of
--
of
the
consumer's
dollar
in
merchandising
methods.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
sir.
we
were
--
when
we
were
a
--
a
manufacturer
in
this
medium
price
field
with
85%
of
our
sales
at
wholesale
from
our
manufactures
to
these
independent
retailers.
we
were
doing
our
level
best
to
encourage
our
independent
retailers
to
modernize
their
stores,
to
change
their
locations
but
since
we
didn't
control
them,
they
had
their
own
capital,
we
couldn't
control
what
they
did.
many
of
these
independent
shoe
dealers
were
men
of
middle
age
or
sometimes
older.
we
tried
to
encourage
some
of
them
to
go
out
and
take
leases
in
these
suburban
shopping
centers
but
that
meant
before
the
insurance
company
made
the
overall
loan,
they
had
to
sign
up
several
years
in
advance,
many
of
them
were
reluctant
to
do
it.
we
were
concerned
just
to
what
the
future
of
shoe
retailing
might
bring.
we
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes,
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
but
--
but
not
with
the
--
not
with
the
idea
that
we
thought
we
can
downgrade
our
own
manufacturing
facilities
with
the
idea
of
selling
our
manufacturing
products
of
these
suburban
outlets.
we
--
we
did
feel
that
it
was
a
--
an
appropriate
and
a
proper
thing
for
us
to
do
take
cognizance
of
the
changes
in
the
merchandising
of
shoes
that
were
--
that
was
taking
place
and
that
this
was
something
which
we
felt
we
should
study
and
work
with
and
we
have
advanced
this
capital
to
the
kinney
people
and
they
have,
i
think
developed
some
118
of
these
suburban
outlets
or
this
free
standing
store.
it's
a
type
of
thing
which
without
any
reference
to
try
to
lessen
competition,
i
would
think
that
any
management
cognizant
of
his
fiduciary
relations
to
its
stockholders
would
study
and
would
hope
to
be
able
to
have
it
workout
and
in
a
manner
not
contrary
to
the
section
7
and
i
can't
possibly
see
how
there's
any
tendency
of
monopoly
here.
i
mean
it's
4%
manufacturing
for
brown
and
four-tenths
of
1%
for
kinney
and
the
retail
level
approximately
1.3
plus
1%.
so
we
--
we
feel
that
--
that
if
you
examine
this
from
an
economic
standpoint
and
look
at
it
realistically
from
the
manner
in
which
shoes
are
marketed
that
it
is
conclusive
that
there
--
it
can't
be
competition.
and
in
these
studies
that
we
put
in
on
this
question
of
medium
--
medium
prices
or
as
you
take
the
prices,
divide
them
up
in
a
half,
those
selling
in
the
lower
range
and
those
in
the
upper
range
and
we
go
in
the
great
detail
on
that
in
our
brief
of
the
--
in
almost
every
instance,
the
medium
price
levels
at
retail
of
the
retail
outlets,
the
independent
dealers
or
wohl
are
150%
to
200%
of
the
kinney
prices
at
retail.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
no.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
i
think
it
has
sold
some
of
the
--
kinney
sells
a
large
number
of
children's
shoes
and
i
think
that
brown
is
a
lower
price
range
than
the
buster
brown
children's
shoe
of
brown
is
the
robin
hood
shoes
and
i
believe
that
brown
has
sold
some
of
the
robin
hood
brand
kiddie
--
robin
hood
brand
brown
shoes
to
kinney.
they
may
have
been
a
few
other
sales
but
they
have
not
been
--
i
think
my
--
if
my
memories
serves
me
correctly,
since
1955
sales
had
gone
up
about
a
billion
two
from
brown
to
kinney
but
at
the
same
time,
the
sales
of
kinney
from
outside
purchasers
have
increased
much
more.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
--
the
brown
in
almost
every
instance
buys
the
highest
grade
leather.
they
buy
the
highest
grade
lines,
highest
grade
soles,
highest
grade
heels.
in
every
instance,
there
--
they
buy
the
top
quality.
there
are
practically
no
common
suppliers.
kinney
tries
to
render
a
very
good
value
for
the
money
in
this
lower
pocket
or
price
field.
but
they
don't
--
where
brown
would
buy
first
grade,
they
would
buy
third
or
fourth
grade
or
where
brown
would
buy
a
very
high
quality
synthetic
rubber
sole
they
would
buy
a
much
lower
quality.
they're
very
few.
they
buy
very
little
at
the
same
manufacturers
and
even
where
they
buy
from
the
same
manufacturers
they
do
not
buy
the
same
quality.
mr.
justice
--
judge
webber
found
also
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
they'd
be
a
listing
of
competition
would
be
because
there
would
be
added
advantages
in
buying
more
materials,
but
that's
not
--
the
evidence
shows
that
that's
not
true.
there'd
be
absolutely
no
advantage
in
the
merger
from
buying
these
additional
materials.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
it
does,
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
reclaimed
that
you
can't
--
the
shoes
are
not
sold
in
the
line
of
commerce
men's
shoes,
women's
shoes
and
children's
shoes
as
such.
you've
got
to
--
we
--
we
think
you've
got
to
examine
the
--
in
each
city,
we
think
you
got
to
examine.
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
as
to
how
shoes
were
sold
in
these
141
cities.
the
only
place
in
st.
louis
where
he
completely,
we
believe,
misread
the
testimony
and
kinney
didn't
have
an
outlet
in
st.
louis,
but
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
whatsoever
with
respect
to
this
141
cities
that
he
took
as
to
how
shoes
are
merchandized
in
those
cities.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
no
sir.
no
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
would
say
that
if
you
were
--
if
you
were
in
the
same
line
of
business
or
in
the
same
price
range
or
you're
competing
with
each
other
in
the
price
range,
there
possibly
could
be
a
violation.
but
we
were
--
these
--
these
studies
of
medium
prices,
these
studies
on
overlaps
showed
that
in
practically
every
category
that
there
has
been
no
overlap.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
that
is
precisely
correct
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
and
then
look
up
the
answer
to
your
question
on
these
findings
and
then
close.
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well,
there
is
that
possibility,
yes
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
the
--
there
is
the
final
judgment
in
addition
to
the
judgment
of
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well,
i
hadn't
considered
that
but
may
i
call
your
attention
to
page
79
of
volume
1
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
where
we
made
a
motion
because
of
the
wording
which
you
just
read,
we
made
a
motion
on
behalf
of
brown
shoe,
to
stay
execution
of
the
final
judgment,
and
we
supported
it
by
an
affidavit.
and
on
the
december
the
28th,
judge
webber
ordered
that
our
motion
--
that
the
defendant's
motion,
that's
the
government's
motion
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
that
our
motion
be
stayed.
the
final
judgment
was
entered
on
december
--
and
the
final
judgment
entered
on
the
december
the
8th
was
stayed
until
the
disposition
of
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
provided
that
the
defendant
prosecutes
its
appeal
with
due
diligence.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
at
subdivision
5
on
page
78
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
i
think
--
i
believe
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
it's
further
ordered
to
judge
in
decree
that
jurisdiction
is
retained
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
parties
to
apply
to
the
court
for
such
further
orders
and
directions
as
maybe
necessary
for
the
enforcement
of
compliance
and
for
punishment
of
violations.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes
and
may
i
call
your
attention
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well
in
--
if
am
i
may
call
your
attention
mr.
justice
harlan
to
the
final
judgment
at
page
77
where
he
--
in
paragraph
1,
he
ordered
in
decree
that
the
acquisition
from
brown
--
by
brown
of
kinney
was
in
violation
and
he
ordered
brown
to
relinquish
and
dispose
of
the
stock.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well,
may
i
reserve
and
ask
you
on
that
in
my
remaining
time
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
realized
that
the
figures
in
this
case
are
very
large.
and
i
realized
they
are
very
difficult
to
carry
in
your
mind
by
understanding
--
the
solicitor
general
said
that
the
manufacturers
acquired
some
13,000
outlets.
i
believe,
according
to
their
brief,
it
should
be
1,300.
and
that
the
manufacturer's
own
increase
should
go
from
1,400
and
not
14,000.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
it's
very
difficult,
i
realized
to
carry
all
these
figures.
i
would
like
to
reply
if
i
may
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
inquiry
to
me
as
to
the
specific
findings
of
the
district
court
to
which
we
take
exception.
other
than
the
judgment,
and
the
final
judgment,
there
were
no
specific
detailed
findings.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
we
challenge
the
opinion.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
they
are
scattered
in
the
opinion.
according
to
the
undisputed
evidence
between
the
government
and
ourselves,
the
brown's
percentage
in
manufacturing
(inaudible)
and
pairs
in
1955
was
4%
and
kinney
was
four-tenths
so,
1%.
the
court
used
the
figures
of
five
and
a
half
of
1%.
although
there
was,
as
i
said
earlier,
a
detailed
evidence
by
merchandising
witnesses
--
merchandising
experts,
the
court
made
no
effort
whatsoever
to
analyze
the
impact
of
the
retail
competition
in
market
by
market.
there
was
no
attempt
to
analyze
what
the
market
was
in
any
particular
situation
as
to
where
people
shop,
as
to
how
they
shopped,
as
to
the
whether
--
our
witnesses
testified
that
they
stayed
in
the
same
price
ranges
and
that
they
did
not
normally
go
beyond
certain
areas.
the
court,
without
analyzing
that
evidence
in
any
of
the
cities,
without
going
into
it
any
detail,
without
attempting
to
find
what
the
actual
practices
were
merely
said
conclusory
that
with
every
shoe
store
in
the
same
city
was
in
competition
with
every
other
shoe
store
in
the
same
city,
and
that
every
shoe
store
without
regard
to
price
or
quality
or
use
of
merchandize
was
in
competition
with
every
other
shoe
in
the
categories
of
men's,
women's
and
children's.
we
believe
that
it
is
required
by
in
any
economic
analysis
or
any
legal
analysis
or
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
to
what
is
a
line
of
commerce,
and
i
believe
it
must
be
a
line
of
commerce
and
in
the
“section
of
the
country”
that
there
must
be
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
impact
of
competition
in
a
line
of
commerce
found
from
the
evidence
in
a
community.
now,
there
isn't
anything
--
there
isn't
anything
in
the
court's
opinion
that
indicates
any
connection
whatsoever
between
this
141
cities
of
10,000
or
over
and
yet
they're
immediately
contiguous
in
any
other
state
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
they're
not
made
nationally.
retail
sales
are
not
made
all
over
the
united
states.
it
depends
upon
your
climate.
the
same
type
of
shoe
is
not
sold
in
florida
as
is
sold
in
maine,
the
same
price
range
is
not
sold
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
no,
i
said
you
had
to
have
a
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
you
had
to
have
both.
but
i
believe
that
the
testimony
is
very
clear
that
there's
a
vast
difference
in
the
economic
incomes
of
the
various
cities
and
the
prices
ranges
in
these
various
cities.
the
type
of
competition,
the
type
of
shoes
that
will
be
bought
in
fort
worth,
texas
would
be
quite
different
than
the
type
of
shoes
that
would
be
bought
in
wilshire
boulevard
in
hollywood.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well,
it
isn't
clear,
mr.
justice
clark.
he
takes
these
141
cities
in
which
fort
worth
is
included
and
simply
says
that
he
takes
each
of
the
141
cities
of
10,000
or
over
and
immediate
or
contiguous
area.
but
there's
nothing
further.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
it
could
be.
i
believe
that
there
were
proper
evidence
given
to
it,
but
there
was
no
analysis
of
it.
there
wasn't
any
attempt
whatsoever
made
in
the
opinion
to
analyze
the
impact
of
competition
in
any
one
of
these
cities
or
how
the
competition
in
any
one
of
these
cities
related
to
the
other
140.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well,
i
think
--
i
think
what
congress
meant
from
the
testimony
was
what
we
contented
for
and
i
believe
what
most
people
thought
that
they
meant
was
in
a
standard
metropolitan
area
in
which
there
would
be
normal
competition,
that
is
the
government
separates
out,
for
example,
the
city
of
texarkana
and
gives
all
of
its
figures
for
that
political
boundaries
of
that
city.
now,
everyone
knows
that
texarkana
is
within
the
general
shopping
range
of
--
of
another
larger
city
in
texas,
just
as
they
know
that
the
(inaudible)
is
within
the
larger
shopping
center
of
omaha.
so
that
if
you
take
all
these
figures
for
a
very
small
political
unit,
as
the
government
tries
to
do,
ignoring
the
fact
that
it's
right
next
to
a
very
large
metropolitan
area,
you
can
get
some
terrific
distortions
as
they
do
in
these
appendices
that
they
put
in
their
reply
brief.
in
their
appendices,
they
rely
on
the
1958
census
which
were
not
available
till
1961
and
were
not
introduced
into
evidence.
and
they
tried
to
take
peerage
figures
without
any
regard
to
the
discrepancies
in
income
throughout,
and
then
they
get
some
terrific
distortions
which
we
point
out
at
considerable
length
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
i
believe
that
in
certain
types,
it
could
be
in
10,000
population,
but
i
would
think
it
also
have
to
have
evidence
as
to
whether
that
city
was
primarily
a
shopping
area
all
onto
itself
or
whether
withdrew
a
certain
percentage
of
its
shopping
from
a
surrounding
area.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
there
were
some
--
there
were
some
14
witnesses,
not
one
who
testified
as
to
retailers.
and
they
all
testified
that
depending
upon
each
city,
they
testified
as
to
the
roads
and
the
bridges
and
the
highways
as
to
where
the
shopping
came
from.
and
they
--
i
think
the
evidence
is
very
clear
that
you
cannot
use
the
political
boundaries
of
the
city.
now
unfortunately,
we
don't
know
precisely
what
judge
weber
meant
by
the
immediately
contiguous
area.
so
therefore,
we
don't
know
whether
the
figures
--
their
old
figures
are
--
the
figures
for
the
political
boundaries
and
their
figures
for
the
standard
metropolitan
area,
but
we
don't
quite
know
what
figures
you
would
use
for
this
rather
indefinite
area
of
the
immediately
surrounding
and
contiguous
area.
you
can
get
some
--
some
very
astounding
figures
if
you
try
to
average
your
national
sale.
we
point
out
that
--
that
part
of
the
government's
own
figures
in
a
town
twice
the
size
of
dodge
city,
they
get
fewer
sales
of
shoes
per
capita.
we
also
point
out
some
other
probably
fantastic
distortions
that
they
get
from
these
appendices
that
put
it
in
their
reply
brief.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
well,
on
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes,
it
would.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
it
would
for
certain
type
of
shoes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
there
are
certain
people
in
the
shoes,
let's
say,
1295,
1495,
1695
would
go
long
distance
as
for
their
shoes.
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
however
that
for
people
who
shop
within
the
popular
price
stores
of
kinney
that
they
generally
don't
go
more
than
a
few
blocks
for
the
purchases
of
their
shoes.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas,
it's
on
page
54
of
the
--
of
the
government's
main
brief.
in
the
second
paragraph
on
page
54,
“appellant
treats
the
case
chiefly
in
terms
of
the
manufacturing
the
market.
it
seeks
to
show
that
brown
and
kinney
do
not
compete
because
they
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
different
lines
of
shoes.
this
now
just
as
might
be
appropriate,
if
there
were
any
issue
concerning
the
effect
of
the
combination
upon
competition
for
brown
and
kinney
as
manufacturers.
the
district
court
found
however
that
the
merger
would
only
slightly
affect
that
kind
of
competition.
the
government
accepts
that
finding.
since
there
wasn't
any
finding
of
any
substantial
lessening
of
competition
of
manufacturing,
i
assumed
that
the
government
accepts
that
finding
of
the
district
court.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
when
i
was
discussing
the
--
the
difference
between
the
sales
to
mostly
to
these
younger
dealers
who
started
in
the
business
on
this
wohl
plan
account
with
a
minimum
amount
of
capital
and
where
they,
after
taken
out
their
salaries
and
expenses,
remitted
the
weekly
proceeds.
i
used
the
term
“sales
on
consignment.”
i
should
not
have
used
that
term
because
i
find
that
title
actually
passes
in
the
sales
to
those
dealers
on
the
wohl
plan
account.
on
the
question
of
this
increase
of
kinney
--
of
brown
sales
to
wohl
after
it
acquired
wohl,
i
like
to
say
that
most
of
the
acquisitions
prior
to
wohl
were
very
minor
and
in
many
instances
were
caused
by
debts
or
some
cases
bankruptcy
and
where
the
manufacturing
plants
were
taken
over
with
request
of
chambers
of
commerce
or
labor
people.
but
on
page
185
of
our
main
brief,
second
full
paragraph,
i
point
out
that
wohl's
purchasers
from
its
outside
shoe
suppliers
other
than
brown
have
risen
from
20,900,000
in
1951,
and
23,886,000
in
1957
so
that
wohl's
purchasers
from
its
outside
shoe
suppliers.
several
years
later
replaces
much
as
its
shoe
purchasers
from
brown
and
it's
during
this
same
period,
wohl's
purchasers
from
outsiders
increased
from
160
to
167.
one
further
fact
and
that
is
that
kinney
purchases
most
of
its
shoes
in
as
very
low
price
range
for
the
sale
in
its
price
range.
and
the
wohl
however,
in
these
leased
departments,
sells
not
only
in
the
medium
grade
fields
but
in
the,
some
cases,
the
higher
grade
fields.
although
it's
very
minimal,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
could
be
even
about
4%
of
the
sales
of
men's
shoes
in
the
leased
departments,
it
possibly
could
be
that
some
of
them
might
be
selling
in
the
same
price
range
as
regal.
i
think
it
would
be
minimal
but
it
might
be
possible.
from
the
total
number
of
outlets,
70,000,
all
shoes,
kinney
and
--
and
brown
combined
would
only
be
0.91%
of
these
total
70,000
outlets.
there
were
no
witnesses
who
testified
as
to
any
possibility
of
their
being
--
their
sales
to
kinney
being
displaced
by
brown.
the
sole
and
only
witness,
there
was
only
one
is
in
government's
exhibit
251.
that
question
was
not
asked
by
the
government.
and
there
isn't
testimony
of
any
witness
or
of
any
implication,
incidence
of
any
such
testimony.
i
just,
again,
to
put
kinney
into
perspective,
its
sales
and
retail
were
41,000,000.
now,
it
is
in
this
lower
the
price
field.
but
the
serious
sales
at
retail
were
104,000,000.
edison
brothers,
all
women's,
87,000,000.
kinney
was
85,000,000
and
there's
testimony
that
the
famous
bar
store
was
the
largest
--
with
eleven
departments,
the
largest
retail
outlet
west
of
the
mississippi
river,
and
the
montgomery
ward
was
41,000,000.
all
of
these
are
larger
than
kinney's.
the
court,
seemed
to
us,
erred
in
using
the
substantive
measure.
as
the
court
knows
this
was
not
used
by
judge
higgs
(ph)
in
the
american
crystal
sugar
case
or
the
transamerica
case
or
by
the
federal
trade
commission
in
the
pillsbury
case.
it
answered
one
question,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
on
these
wholesale
sales
of
wohl
--
75%
of
wohl's
wholesale
sales
are
made
to
dealers
who
are
not
on
the
wohl
plan
or
were
not
on
the
wohl
plan
and
25%
are
made
to
those
on
the
wohl
plan.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
in
conclusion
to
our
reply
brief
in
answer
to
these
appendices
of
the
government
and
to
the
fact
that
we
believed
that
these
appendices
include
what
are
wholesale
sales
to
the
independent
dealers
and
the
retail
sales
of
those
same
dealers
and
to
what
they're
trying
to
--
therefore
the
numerators
and
the
denominators
are
in
inconsistent
basis
and
they're
trying
to
compare
apples
and
bananas
with
oranges.
in
conclusion,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
submit
that
there
was
complete
failure
to
analyze
the
evidence
on
the
part
of
the
district
court.
the
government
has
accepted
the
fact
that
there
was
no
substantial
lessening
of
competition
in
manufacturing.
and
we
believe
that
our
briefs
and
the
evidence
will
conclusively
show
that
there
was
no
substantial
lessening
of
competition
in
the
retail
field
or
in
the
manufacturing
and
retail
field
combined.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
dean
we
would
be
very
happy
to
submit
a
memorandum
on
that
point.

arthur
