while
they're

justice

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
you
sit
down,
i
have
a
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
for
you
mr.
dean.
the
district
court
erred
in
finding
this,
the
question
(inaudible)
in
terms
of
the
decree
it
said
--
he
said
in
his
opinion,
he
said
he
can't
find
any
and
the
judgment
itself
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
thought
(inaudible)
answer
to
it
that
medium
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
there
maybe
another
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
--
my
troubles
is
that,
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
hypothesis
is
simply
this,
a
practical
one,
assuming
that
the
(inaudible)
loss
of
the
case
and
it
goes
back,
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
that
question
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
hope
you're
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
rejected?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
wonder
if
i
could
restate
it
because
the
solicitor
general's
answer
doesn't
satisfy
me,
that
is
the
answer.
my
problem
is
this,
whether
or
not
in
view
of
the
fact
of
this
decree,
although
in
paragraph
1,
undertook
to
order
an
unqualified
divestiture,
nevertheless,
goes
on
to
say
in
paragraph
4
that
the
divestiture
is
to
be
subject
to
approval
of
the
court
on
notice
by
parties
in
submission
of
the
plan,
whether
an
appeal
at
this
stage
satisfies
the
particular
requirements
of
15
u.s.c.
in
section
29.
it
is
perfectly
true
and
what
the
court
said
as
to
the
purpose
of
that
section
at
page
558
of
279
u.s.
united
states,
california.
while
it
is
perfectly
true
as
the
solicitor
general
says
that
ordinarily
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
equity
case
is
reviewable
whether
--
even
though
its
interlocutory,
that
is
by
reason
of
the
particular
provisions
of
section
28
992
(a)
and
section
15
u.s.c.
29
which
lays
the
foundation
for
this
appeal
excludes
in
government
antitrust
cases
the
application
of
that
section
which
the
solicitor
general,
i
presume
had
in
mind,
in
appeal
to
government
in
antitrust
cases.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
is.
that's
my
problem.
