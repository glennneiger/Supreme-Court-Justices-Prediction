on

mr.

asked
you
the
question
as
to
jurisdiction

whether
--
whether
you
thought
this
case
was
properly
here
under
--
under
25
u.s.c
section

and
i
wondered
if
you

would
be
willing
to
submit
a
memorandum
to
us
on
that
score.
chief
justice
earl

would
you
that
please?
chief

that

won't
be
any
misunderstanding,
i'm
going
to
ask
mr.
justice

if
you
will
restate
the
question
because
he'd
like
it
to
have
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
justice

would
like
to
add
an
addendum
to
