doesn't
that
number
fluctuates
all
the
time?
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
contracts
are
cancellable
on
very
short
notice,

--

customers.
justice
potter
stewart
was
brown
a
retailer
before
the
acquisition
of
regal
and
wohl?
justice
potter
stewart
primarily
men's
shoes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
before
the
acquisition
of
regal
and
wohl
with
the
exception
of
this
unsuccessful
experience
many
years
ago,
brown
was
not
a
seller
or
retailer
but
i
suppose
did
have
the
brown
franchise
plan,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
the
record
show
that
chain
retail
shoe
stores
are
not
a
new
--
are
not
a
new
phenomenon,
they
go
back
before
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
regal
itself
for
instance,
i
--
regal
itself
goes
back
to
the
1930's
at
least.
justice
potter
stewart
before
the
--
before
this
merger,
did
brown
sell
to
kinney?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
does
now?
justice
potter
stewart
all
this
--
or
most
of
what
you've
said
that
is
an
attack
on
the
--
on
the
district
court's
finding
of
the
--
what
was
the
line
of
commerce,
isn't
it?
all
of
which
of
--
most
of
what
you've
told
us
so
far
adds
up
to
an
attack
on
the
district
court's
finding
of
what
was
the
line
of
commerce?
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
you're
right,
then
am
i
correct
in
saying
that
the
logical
conclusion
of
your
position
is
that
in
the
retail
shoe
business
there
can
never
be
a
violation
of
section
7?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
while
you're
right
on
this
aspect
of
your
argument,
let
me
ask
you
two
questions.
i
--
i'm
right
at
remembering,
am
i
not,
that
kinney
also
is
a
manufacturer?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
secondly,
a
different
question.
mr.
dean
told
us
as
i
understood
him
that
no
witness
during
this
extensive
trial
testified
--
no
manufacturer
testified
that
he
had
any
fear
that
he
would
be
displaced
as
a
supplier
of
kinney
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
the
act
--
but
its
acquisition
by
brown.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
him
to
say
what
i
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
as
you
tell
us
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
also
a
testimony
--
that
it
hasn't
happened
yet?
justice
potter
stewart
two
or
three
years,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
on
litigation.
justice
potter
stewart
slightly
means
it
was
not
substantial
i
suppose.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
just
again
--
but
i'm
sorry
to
keep
you
holding
up
but
i'm
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
argument.
it's
true
is
it
not
with
the
respect
to
this
--
to
the
manufacturing
merger,
the
merger
--
the
merger
of
the
manufacturers
that
after
this
was
all
over
brown
still
manufactured
--
what
was
it,
4.4%
of
the
shoes
in
the
country
or
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
4.4.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
had
been
4%
then
became
4.4%
as
among
what,
700
manufacturers?
justice
potter
stewart
dropped
to
900
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
was
still
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
still
somewhere
between
900
to
1000
manufactures
in
that?
justice
potter
stewart
now
to
which
specific
one
of
the
three
amendments
was
that
language
addressed?
justice
potter
stewart
just
--
so
you
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
elimination
of
community
was
a
–not
a
tightening
but
a
loosening
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
third
amendment
wasn't
tightening
either
because
the
words
used
to
read
in
such
a
way
that
as
you've
just
said,
they
would
literally
forbid
any
--
if
you've
read
literally,
they
would
forbid
any
merger,
any
conceivable
merger,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
words
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
words
were
made
much
less
restrictive,
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
statutory
mergers.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
used
men's,
women's
and
children's
shoes
as
three
lines
of
commerce,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
big
four
had
a
quarter
of
the
total
national
production?
justice
potter
stewart
and
brown
had
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
four
percent.
justice
potter
stewart
four
percent.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
big
--
and
the
big
two
must
have
been
very
big?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
together
a
20%
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
then
i
misunderstood
you
mr.
solicitor.
justice
potter
stewart
which
brown
is
third
or
fourth?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
this
argument
in
which
you're
making
the
point
that
brown
was
very
big
also
makes
the
point
that
kinney
was
quite
small,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
solicitor,
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
wohl.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
this
is
only
the
department
store
outlet.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
all
wohl
does,
isn't
it?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
at
retail,
that
is
the
way
it
will
--
operates
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
departments.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes,
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
wohl
and
regal
by
your
own
definition
were
in
different
lines
of
commerce,
weren't
they?
wohl
made
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
primarily
in
ladies'
shoes
and
regal
primarily
in
men's
shoes,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
it
true
that
regal's
retail
stores
is
only
one
--
sells
one
shoe,
no?
didn't
they
have
an
unsuccessful
experience
with
women's
shoes,
or
no?
justice
potter
stewart
men's
shoes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
are
separate
lines
of
commerce,
you
told
us.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
they
are
not
competitive
with
each
other.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
considerable
turnover
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
turnover
every
year.
justice
potter
stewart
and
lot
of
them
did
quit
as
you
call
it,
every
year.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
would
have
--
become
new.
justice
potter
stewart
well
kinney,
as
i
understand,
it
sells
men's,
women's,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
children's
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
would
be
competitive
of
both
--
justice
potter
stewart
regal
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
wohl
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
although
wohl
and
regal
are
not
competitive
in
most
places.
justice
potter
stewart
he
used
as
direct
testimony
one
day,
and
cross-examination
in
the
next.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it's
true,
mr.
cox,
that
the
statute
as
it
used
to
be
worded
would
by
its
literal
terms
have
absolutely
prohibited
the
acquisition
of
one
small
shoe
--
shoe
store
in
peoria,
illinois
by
another
small
shoe
store
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
peoria,
illinois.
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
that
also
men's
shoes.
justice
potter
stewart
are
these
138
cities
in
--
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
located
in
--
located
in
every
geographic
region
of
the
country?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
would
be
a
matter
of
definition,
but
they
are
all
over?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
nature
of
things,
mr.
dean,
retailed
sales
are
made
in
metropolitan
communities?
they're
not
made
out
in
the
woods
or
in
the
farms
somewhere?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
will
go
to
the
line
of
commerce
point.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
i'm
--
i
thought
you
were
now
addressing
yourself
to
the
“section
of
the
country”
point.
justice
potter
stewart
both.
you
had
to
have
both.
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
there
would
be
the
dodge
city
draws
on
a
large
area
for
its
customers
and
some
other
suburb
in
new
york
which
maybe,
too,
twice
the
size
of
dodge
city
draws
on
a
much
more
compact
group
of
people?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
in
certain
--
in
certain
lines
of
commerce,
denver,
colorado
draws
on
the
entire
area,
the
entire
rocky
mountain
area.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
that
whole
section
--
