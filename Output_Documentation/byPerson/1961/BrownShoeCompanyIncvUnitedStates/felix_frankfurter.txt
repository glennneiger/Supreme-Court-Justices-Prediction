justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
all
--
as
you
know,
i
want
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
dean,
may
i
ask
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
the
manufacturers,
it
supply
the
chains
--
have
that
as
an
exclusive
market
although
they
compete
with
brown
as
to
--
in
other
market?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
dean,
may
i
interrupt
you
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
indicated
a
minute
ago
when
you
challenged
the
finding,
that
leads
me
to
ask
whether
when
you
do
not
say
challenge
it
--
when
you
do
not
indicate
that
what
you
are
telling
us
is
contradicted
by
findings
which
you
object
to
or
which
you
take
exception
to,
are
we
to
assume
what
you've
said
also
is
reflected
in
the
findings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
as
to
this
last
statement
of
yours,
but
generally
as
i
follow
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
am
i
to
infer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
in
their
rate
is
supported
by
findings
except
when
you
specially
say
it
isn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
dean,
i
do
not
want
to
interrupt
or
divert
the
order
of
your
argument
in
your
mind
because
you
thought
a
lot
about
this,
but
even
now
if
it's
appropriate
or
sometimes
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
how
many
findings
in
number
--
how
many
findings
of
fact
the
court
below
may
and
which
of
those
findings
you
take
exceptions
to?
i
ought
to
have
that
mind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
i
do
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you've
said
he
took
those
out
of
the
blue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
mean
apart
from
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
did
i
also
understand
you
to
say
that
these
--
as
to
these
141,
the
issue
wasn't
either
focused
or
even
directed
at
the
client,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
page
mr.
dean
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
that
you
feel
with
the
suggestions
of
the
fee,
finding
of
the
court
that
it
isn't
merely
a
question
of
percentage
control
of
manufacturing
but
that
the
big
fellows
in
the
large
mass
of
manufacturers
set
the
pace
and
it
was
psychologically
rather
than
merely
quantitatively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
the
manufacturing
competitive
of
brown
as
they
all
--
is
there
output
or
named
output
by
brown?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
way
if
any
did
the
district
court
give
to
the
momentum
of
good
will
that
comes
from
a
brand
name
or
from
what
--
have
you
indicated
brown
has
a
goodwill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that's
relevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is
that
this
is
no
different
from
your
point
of
view
then
if
brown
had
decided
not
to
go
also
in
the
lingerie
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
turns
on
--
i
should
think,
(a)
what
the
findings
of
the
court
were,
(b)
the
justifications
of
those
findings
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
necessarily
limited
review,
would
you
agree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
that
point
of
view,
what
do
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
dean,
isn't
the
short
answer,
it
doesn't
have
to
be.
isn't
that
the
short
answer?
i
should
think
if
--
on
the
subject
to
correct
you
by
my
brother
or
others,
but
i
think
if
we
had
no
more
then
paragraph
1
would
be
properly
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
you
like
(inaudible)
of
these,
they're
very
often
in
a
minute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
tell
me
i'm
wrong
but
wouldn't
--
if
we
had
only
paragraph
1,
would
be
properly
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
specific
finding
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
asked
them
--
the
government
asked
them
to
find
for
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
going
to
ask
why
--
that
puzzled
me
a
little
bit.
is
brown
--
is
one
of
the
--
is
the
third
biggest
of
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
third
--
fourth,
one
of
the
leaders?
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
kinney
is
substantial,
but
wasn't
there
a
finding
that
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
marriage
was
illicit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
that,
i
think
it's
--
it
shouldn't
be
or
it
ought
to
bear
on
what
is
called
a
tendency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
time
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
point.
i
was
thinking
5%
instead
of
4%,
5
from
(inaudible)
on
a
nationwide
scale,
5%
to
5.5%.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
figures
are
important
at
this
domain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting,
it's
very
important
for
the
district
court
to
have
been
careful.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
puzzled
me
by
saying
it
didn't
do
it
in
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
word
--
the
word
must
accomplish
your
tightening.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
--
as
justice
stewart
has
just
pointed
out
to
–
prior
to
change
from
--
in
any
community,
from
any
section,
it'd
be
certainly
tightened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
how
–
how
does
--
please
explain
in
a
word,
how
does
lessening
--
liberalizing
the
language
tightening
the
gloss,
i
don't
understand
that.
[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
would
lead
to
new
liberalizing
gloss.
if
you
liberalize
--
if
you
liberalize
the
basis
of
construction,
you
liberalize
the
basis
for
interpreting
what
the
words
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
break
in
to
ask
whether
you
can
break
up
where
in
any
line
of
commerce
in
any
section,
are
those
distributed
terms
or
is
that
a
unified
collective
terms.
in
other
words,
it
must
have
been
a
line
of
commerce
in
any
section
in
any
section
or
is
any
line
of
commerce
to
be
detached
from
that
next
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
any
lines
of
commerce
in
the
abstract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
must
it
mean
any
line
of
commerce
in
any
section?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
the
section,
conjunctively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
that
the
line
of
commerce
relates
to
a
single
community
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
i'd
like
to
get
laid
down
is
whether
unrelated
15
cities
constitute
a
“section
of
the
country.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
now
talking,
are
you
now
talking
between
--
are
you
not
talking
competition
between
shoe
manufacturers
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
sell
throughout
the
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
as
to
them,
must
it
not
be
in
any
line
of
commerce
in
any
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it
a
question
of
arithmetic
or
geography,
but
let
me
be
specific.
suppose
you
have
two
powerful
shoe
companies
competing
for
a
very
specialized
fancy
movie
star
shoe
market
in
the
city
of
new
york
exclusively
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suppose
that's
the
only
city
that
is
an
outfit
as
between
two
competing
manufacturers,
that
new
york
women
or
enough
of
them
care
for
particular
kind
of
too
thick
heeled
of
a
special
kind,
so
thin
that
almost
invisible
to
the
eye,
yet
giving
gravitation
support.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
i
can
say
is
you
can
by
agreement,
you
had
a
difficulty
out
of
my
head.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't.
i
just
want
to
get
enlightened
at
the
outset.
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
my
case
of
two
powerful
manufacturers
as
competing
for
a
specialized
new
york
market
in
particular
kind
of
shoe,
will
that
be
within
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
i
don't
understand
the
act.
but
may
well
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
--
i
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
that
answer.
that
implies
that
it
is
a
section
of
the
country
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
because
there
are
15
unrelated
discrete,
separate
communities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
think
if
you
multiply
discreteness,
it
makes
it
a
compound.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
troubles
to
me
is
when
congress
changes
a
phrase
which
has
limited
geographic
connotation,
the
one
which
has
wider
geographic
connotation,
i
must
face
a
need
to
that.
i
can't
ride
off
on
general
vague
intentions
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
maybe
all
wrong
but
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
this
business
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
see
you
have
--
neither
before
lunch
nor
now
dealt
with
what
to
me
is
a
troublesome
thing
that
congress
for
reasons
of
its
own
has
changed
from
the
phrase
in
any
community
to
--
in
any
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
could
have
an
interstate
if
it
isn't
--
in
relation
to
interstate
commerce,
it
isn't
within
the
statute
anyhow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cox,
you've
told
us
a
lot
about
congressional
history
and
you've
talked
about
the
mind
of
congress.
does
congresses
mind
express
or
tell
us
from
the
legislative
history
on
this
change
in
the
face
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
did
the
report
say
anything
why
they
made
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
meant
the
specific
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it
was
your
extrapolation
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
challenging
the
opinions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
scattered
in
the
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
like
to
add
if
considered
whether
assuming
it
cannot
be
brought
here
under
section
29
directly,
whether
it
can
be
brought
to
--
whether
the
case
can
be
transferred
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
record,
or
whether
neither
this
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction.
