where
did
the
money
on
the
north
half
go
of
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
general
use.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question?
the
solicitor
general,
a
former
solicitor
general
was
invited
by
the
court
to
file
a
memorandum
on
this
question
and
he
came
up
with
a
memorandum
on
the
petition
agreeing
with
the
petitioner
that
this
was
part
of
an
indian
reservation,
did
you
--
i
assume
you've
seen
this
memorandum.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
disagree
with
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you,
you
finish
your
sentence.
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
only
when
you're
through.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
i
want
to
ask
you
is
whether
the
act
of
1906
which
i
think
you're
referring,
it's
a
very
long
and
i
haven't
read
it,
does
that
undertake
to
define
new
boundaries
of
the
indian
territory?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
specific
terms,
in
other
words,
the
essence
of
your
argument
is
that
when
you
add
all
these
together,
it
is
as
if
congress
had
said
from
hereafter
the
boundaries
of
the
indian
territory
what
remains
will
be
doesn't
so
which
would
exclude
east
omak,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
essence
of
your
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
there's
nothing
expressed
in
the
act
that
undertakes
to
do
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
