mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
by
virtue
of
an
order
of
this
court
granting
a
motion
for
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
in
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
for
the
state
of
washington.
the
facts
if
the
court
please,
are
these,
paul
seymour,
the
petitioner
is
an
american
indian.
he
is
an
enrolled
member
of
the
colville
tribes
of
the
colville
indian
reservation
in
the
state
of
washington.
on
or
before
august
25,
1956,
the
petitioner
with
others
burglarized
and
i
will
assume
during
all
of
my
statement
that
the
facts
of
the
burglary
are
true,
burglarized
the
market
in
the
village
of
east
omak,
in
the
state
of
washington.
i
should
like
to
refer
the
court
at
this
point
to
appendix
b
of
our
opening
brief
which
contains
a
sketch
of
the
colville
indian
reservation
as
it
existed
prior
to
1892.
if
the
court
please,
you
will
note
that
the
northern
boundary
is
the
canadian
boundary.
the
eastern
and
southern
boundaries
are
the
columbia
river.
the
western
boundary
is
the
okanogan
river.
you
will
note
that
inside
the
boundary
on
the
west
--
on
the
east
side
of
the
okanogan
river
is
the
village
of
east
omak.
on
august
27,
1956,
seymour
was
arraigned
in
the
superior
court
in
and
for
the
county
of
okanogan.
he
was
charged
with
the
state
crime
of
burglary
in
a
second
degree.
he
pleaded
not
guilty.
on
october
09,
1956,
not
quite
two
months
later,
he
appeared
in
the
court
with
appointed
counsel
and
counsel
asked
to
leave
under
the
washington
procedure
to
withdraw
the
plea
of
not
guilty
to
the
crime
of
burglary
in
the
second
degree
and
to
enter
a
plea
to
the
crime
of
attempt
of
burglary
in
the
second
degree.
that
request
was
granted.
the
court
sentenced
petitioner
to
a
term
of
not
to
exceed
seven
and
a
half
years
in
the
state
penitentiary.
apparently,
under
the
washington
state
procedure
that
is
in
referred
to
the
appropriate
administrative
body
and
that
body
took
action
to
set
seven
and
a
half
years
as
the
minimum
punishment.
after
confinement,
seymour
applied
to
the
supreme
court
to
the
state
washington
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
among
other
allegations,
he
alleged
that
the
crime
committed
was
within
indian
country
as
defined
by
section
1151
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
and
that
therefore,
the
states
of
washington
had
no
jurisdiction
to
try
or
sentence
him.
to
return
an
answer
of
the
superintendent
of
the
washington
state
penitentiary
according
to
the
washington
supreme
court
raised
factual
issues
which
it
referred
to
the
superior
court
in
and
for
the
county
of
okanogan.
it
was
to
determine
among
other
things
whether
the
locus
of
the
crime
was
within
indian
country.
the
superior
court
held
a
hearing,
took
testimony
and
it
made
a
study
of
the
statutes
involved.
it
held
that
the
situs
of
the
crime
was
not
indian
country
and
that
therefore,
the
courts
of
the
state
of
washington
had
jurisdiction.
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
it
followed
the
prior
ruling
of
its
own
at
1919
relating
to
the
same
reservation
and
concluded
that
since
the
precise
track
of
land
upon
which
the
crime
was
committed
had
passed
from
indian
travel
ownership
to
a
trust
a
lot
in
status
to
an
individual
member
and
then
to
a
non-indian
in
fee
simple.
the
area
was
not
within
indian
country
as
defined
by
the
federal
criminal
code.
on
brief,
this
is
the
issue
which
is
before
this
court
today
namely,
was
the
locus
of
the
crime
within
indian
country
as
defined
by
section
1151
(a)
of
the
federal
criminal
code,
title
18.
that
section
reads,
“all
land
within
the
limits
of
any
indian
reservation
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
government
notwithstanding
the
issuance
of
any
patent
is
indian
country
and
as
to
indian
country
federal
jurisdiction
is
exclusive.”
we
say
the
washington
supreme
court
committed
error
to
show
that
it
did
--
it's
necessary
to
review
a
series
of
four
activities
relating
to
the
colville
indian
reservation.
the
first
concerns
the
period
prior
to
1872.
prior
to
that
date,
colville
tribe
and
the
tribes
which
are
affiliated
with
it
and
now
still
occupied
the
colville
indian
reservation
occupied
a
considerably
larger
area
generally
in
the
northeastern
section
of
the
state
of
washington.
on
july
02,
1872,
an
executive
order
was
promulgated.
that
set
forth
the
boundary
of
the
reservation
as
i
previously
indicated
to
the
court
namely,
the
canadian
border
on
the
north,
the
columbia
river
on
the
east
and
south
and
the
okanogan
river
on
the
west.
the
next
step
which
is
pertinent
is
an
act
of
congress
of
july
01,
1892,
that
act
related
and
affect
--
related
to
and
affected
only
the
north
half
of
the
colville
reservation.
as
the
court
will
see
the
north
half
has
been
indicated
on
the
sketch
mark
appendix
b
to
our
opening
brief.
that
act
provided
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
the
1892
act
related
only
to
the
north
half
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
the
crime
occurred
in
the
south
half.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
which
we've
called
here
the
diminished
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
--
reservation.
the
act
of
1892
which
dealt
only
with
the
north
half
vacated
and
restored
to
the
public
domain;
all
lands
within
that
north
half
except
for
allotments
which
had
been
made
to
individual
indians.
in
addition,
it
described
as
paralleling
the
49th
parallel
of
latitude
that
marked
--
the
line
we've
marked
in
the
center
of
our
sketch
as
the
center
limit
of
the
area
vacated
and
restored
to
the
public
domain.
in
addition,
it
provided
the
proceeds
and
the
sales
or
entries
of
lands
and
the
north
half
should
be
deposited
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
to
be
used
for
public
use.
the
next
and
last
act
that's
necessary
to
refer
to
is
the
act
of
congress
of
march
22,
1906.
this
act
related
to
the
south
half,
what
we've
called
the
diminished
reservation
and
which
includes
the
town
of
east
omak.
that
act
after
providing
for
allotments,
to
members
of
colville
tribes
and
some
reservations
for
administrative
purposes
through
open
the
settlement
and
entry
under
the
homestead
laws,
the
surplus
land.
the
proceeds
of
these
sales
were
to
be
deposited
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
to
the
threat
of
the
colville
tribes.
that's
one
distinction
between
that
and
the
act
of
1892.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
went
to
the
public
treasury
for
appropriation
for
the
general
public
use.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
under
the
1906
act,
it
was
deposited
in
the
treasury
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
the
other
distinction
between
the
act
of
1892
and
the
act
of
1906
is
that
the
act
of
1892
drew
a
new
boundary,
tracks
it
with
midway
through
the
reservation.
the
1892
act
in
effect
separated
the
north
half
from
the
reservation.
the
1906
act
drew
a
new
boundary
for
the
south
half
or
diminished
reservation.
now,
the
position
of
the
state
and
as
we
understand
it
is
that
the
act
of
1906
by
opening
the
south
half
to
settlement
under
the
homestead
laws
diminished
if
not
dissolved
the
colville
reservation.
we
say
on
the
basis
of
many
cases
decided
by
this
court
and
on
the
basis
of
reasoning
and
taking
into
account
the
history
which
has
developed
into
the
present
reading
of
section
1151
(a)
of
the
criminal
code,
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
to
the
state
of
washington
must
be
rejected.
i
have
seven
reasons,
i
would
like
to
recite.
the
first
is
a
distinction.
it's
already
pointed
out
with
respect
to
the
1892
act
and
the
1906
act.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
if
it
was
held
in
fee
patent
by
a
non-indian
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
to
the
benefit
and
the
credit
of
the
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes
sir,
under
the
section
1151
(a)
that
is
land
still
within
the
limits
of
an
indian
reservation
and
that
section
defines
indian
country
as
all
land
within
the
limits
of
an
indian
reservation
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
not
--
not
withstanding
the
issuance
of
any
patent.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it
remained
such
until
congress
takes
action
to
change
(voice
overlap)
boundaries
of
that
reservation,
yes
sir.
now,
that
fit
your
seven
reasons
why
we
think
the
action
of
the
washington
supreme
court
must
be
reversed.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
one
is
a
distinction
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
one
is
a
distinction
i've
already
pointed
out
between
the
act
of
1892
and
1906.
we
say
that
the
1892
act
did
redefine
the
boundaries.
it
separated
the
north
half
in
the
reservation.
the
1906
act
did
not
do
that.
the
united
states
was
merely
acting
as
trustee
for
the
indians
and
until
congress
redefines
or
diminishes
that
reservation,
it's
still
indian
country.
second,
this
conclusion
is
supported
by
an
uninterrupted
series
of
congressional
actions
between
the
period
1906
to
1956.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
that
is
my
position,
of
course,
that
did
not
happen
here
a
small
amount
only
with
(inaudible).
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
you're
speaking
of
public
law
28
(o)
of
the
83rd
congress
which
transferred
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
federal
jurisdiction
to
central
states.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes
sir
and
the
washington
state
legislature
in
1957
took
action
to
assume
jurisdiction
over
indian
reservations
where
indians
consent
the
indian
tribes
of
the
colville
reservation
have
not
consented
to
state
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
the
last
figure
shows
that
approximately
half
of
20
similar
indian
tribes
in
the
state
of
washington
have
consent.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
i'm
not
certain
(voice
overlap)
here
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
there
are
approximately
3600.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
well,
there
are
3600
enrolled
members,
they
live
on
the
reservations,
some
lived
in
the
north
half
and
some
live
elsewhere
something
more
than
a
half
live
on
the
reservation.
in
addition,
my
second
point
is
that
over
a
period
of
50
years,
congress
has
shown
the
recognition
of
the
continuing
existence
to
colville
reservation
occurred
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
this
crime
act
happened
approximately
one
month
after
the
1956
act
which
i
assume
you
realized
restored
to
tribal
ownership
those
lands
which
have
not
been
disposed
off
under
the
homestead
and
other
public
land
laws
and
that
represented
in
excess
of
800,000
acres,
the
south
half
or
diminished
portion
of
the
reservation
approximates
a
1,365,000
acres.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
if
i
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
if
i
understand
your
question
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes
sir.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
that's
correct.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
no
sir,
oh,
the
only
effect
to
the
1956
act
is
rather
indirect
when
namely
that
over
800,000
acres
have
been
restored
to
tribal
ownership
within
the
diminished
reservation
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
sir?
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
--
but
i
don't
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
i
don't
think
it
does
except
as
the
history
of
that
act
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
--
shows
that
further
recognition
by
a
congress.
in
addition
to
congress,
the
executive
branch
over
the
same
period
of
time
and
that
is
from
1892
to
1956
has
taken
action
issued
rulings
through
its
solicitor
which
show
continuing
recognition
that
the
colville
reservation
has
existed
for
the
period
involved.
my
fourth
point
related
to
the
action
of
the
washington
state
legislature
and
i
said
in
answer
to
question
early
from,
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
in
order
for
the
boundaries
of
reservation
to
be
changed,
it
takes
action
by
congress
to
do
that.
i
think
that's
apparent
from
the
celestine
case
in
215
u.s.
and
i
think
that
principle
has
been
enunciated
by
this
court
as
recently
as
william
against
lee
in
358
u.s.
next,
the
washington
supreme
court
itself
has
correctly
interpreted
a
similar
law
that
is
similar
to
1906
act
here
which
applies
to
the
yakima
reservation.
in
appendix
e
of
our
brief,
we
have
shown
less
than
a
parallel
column,
the
yakima
act,
the
colville
act
and
i
submit
there's
no
substantial
distinction
between
those.
yet,
in
interpreting
the
yakima
act,
the
washington
supreme
court
has
freed
at
least
six
indian
citizens
because
it
decided
correctly
that
the
state
had
no
jurisdiction.
apparently,
it
has
not
seen
this
similarity
between
that
act
and
the
act
which
relates
to
the
colville
reservation.
finally,
to
emphasize
my
last
point,
under
the
clear
language
of
section
1151
(a)
which
confines
indian
country
as
all
lands
within
the
limits
of
any
indian
reservation
under
the
jurisdiction
of
united
states
government
notwithstanding
the
issuance
of
any
patent,
that
land
is
indian
country
and
the
federal
jurisdiction
is
exclusive.
in
conclusion,
we
submit
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
should
be
reversed
then
that
the
petitioner
seymour
must
be
released
in
custody.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
if
the
court
please.
as
i
understand
mr.
way's
addressed
during
the
argument
it
is
this,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
after
his
proclamation
of
1916
which
he
issued
pursuant
to
the
act
of
1906
set
aside
the
townsite
of
east
omak
and
that
by
doing
so,
he
redefined
and
excluded
the
townsite
of
east
omak
from
the
colville
reservation.
first,
that's
not
possible
without
act
of
congress
as
this
court
itself
has
held
not
even
this
court
could
redefine
the
reservation
in
that
manner.
now,
there
are
principles
in
this
field
where
you
seem
to
be
going
one
way
at
one
time,
in
one
way
in
another.
but
i
just
like
to
go
briefly
through
section
1151
and
demonstrate
to
this
court
the
congress
when
finally
amended
this
act
knew
precisely
what
it
was
doing.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
the
date
of
the
amendment
which
includes
the
phrase
notwithstanding
the
issuance
of
any
patent
was
in
1948.
and
that
amendment
was
recommended
by
the
department
of
the
interior
as
you
can
see
from
61
interior
decisions
298,
in
1942
when
it
was
precisely
to
meet
this
situation.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
as
i
understand
it
and
there's
a
serious
factual
error
in
that
opinion
which
i
believe
makes
it
difficult
to
understand.
you
alluded
to
mr.
justice
when
you
mentioned
their
phraseology
south
half
of
the
diminished
reservation.
that
has
no
meaning
and
indicates
to
me
only
that
they
were
confused
with
the
term
“south
half”
and
“diminished”.
actually
those
terms
are
synonymous
and
they
both
referred
to
what
we've
shown
in
our
sketch
in
appendix
b
as
the
diminished
reservation.
in
the
whole
history
of
this,
except
for
the
two
opinions
that
washington
supreme
court
nowhere
is
their
phrase
south
half
of
the
diminished
reservation.
now,
as
i
understand
that
opinion,
they
say
that
the
act
of
issuance
of
fee
patent
to
non-indians
acts
to
exclude
those
tracks
from
within
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
reservation
and
that
those
particular
tracks
are
therefore
no
longer
indian
country.
and
i
say
that's
contrary
to
the
clear
language,
intention,
and
purpose
of
section
1151.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
your
honor,
i'm
not
certain
but
i
would
have
to
express
some
doubt
whether
it
could
be
retroactive.
but
i
think
that
even
taking
the
cases
and
the
definition
which
was
then
in
both
governing
the
10
major
federal
crimes
that
those
tracks
would
have
been
within
the
limits
of
indian
reservations
which
was
the
language
in
the
law
at
that
time
and
that
it
would
still
be
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
but
i
would
like
to
go
on
now
very
briefly
if
i
may
just
go
through
the
section
1151
and
reminds
the
court
where
all
of
the
phrases
in
this
come
from.
first,
as
i
start
to
indicate,
the
1948
amendment
which
is
the
language
in
section
8
notwithstanding
the
issuance
of
any
patent
was
adopted
in
1948
was
recommended
to
the
attorney
general
by
the
department
of
the
interior
in
1942
and
it
eventually
got
to
congress
and
it
was
enacted
and
included
within
this
section
for
the
specific
purpose
of
covering
the
situation
like
we
have
here.
the
solicitor
of
the
department
of
the
interior
and
others
had
said
that
if
we
don't
have
all
inclusive
boundaries
surround
an
area
of
indian
country,
it
means
the
law
enforcement
officers
are
going
to
have
to
carry
track
books
around
where
they
find
out
whether
this
man's
patent
is
in
fee
or
just
what
the
situation
is.
to
make
it
crystal
clear
that
all
area
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
reservation
was
indian
country,
congress
included
this.
now,
the
phrase
“rights
of
way
running
through
the
reservation”
which
follows
that
was
1932
amendment
by
congress.
nothing
more
than
the
codification
to
get
around
to
this
court's
ruling
in
the
clairmont
case
in
225
u.s.
where
indian
trip
--
indian
liquor
laws
were
involved.
the
man
was
arrested
on
a
right
of
way,
railroad
right
of
way
where
they
have
a
fee
patent.
this
court
said
that
was
no
longer
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
the
subsection
(c)
of
section
1151
is
nothing
more
than
a
codification
of
united
states,
pelican
--
against
pelican
232
u.s.
which
involved
the
north
half
of
this
precise
reservation
and
where
this
court
decided
that
was
on
an
indian
trust
allotment
that
that
was
still
federal
jurisdiction.
the
rest
of
the
north
half
became
state
jurisdiction
and
in
substance
if
the
court
say
--
the
court
please,
an
answer
to
one
question,
it's
my
opinion
that
this
court
must
decide
whether
the
situs
of
the
crime
within
the
townsite
of
east
omak
was
indian
country.
if
it
was
indian
country,
the
petitioner
has
been
deprived
of
due
process.
he
is
being
held
by
ruling
of
a
court
which
had
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
i
can't
point
to
any
your
honor
but
i'm
positive
in
my
own
mind
that
is
happening.
and
certainly,
you
see
from
our
brief
that
i
think
about
page
20
that
the
state
has
this
claim
or
the
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
the
state
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
or
the
yakima
reservation
which
is
situation
identical
with
colville.
thank
you.
