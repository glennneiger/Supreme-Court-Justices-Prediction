it's
in
the
north
or
the
south?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
the
particular
place
that
we
had
--
we
have
under
consideration
of
this
case
had
this
crime
occurred?
justice
hugo

black
south?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
how
minimum
was
of
this
particular
tribe?
justice
hugo

black
on
this
reservation?
justice

black
on
this
reservation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
in
that
and
see
if
i
can
understand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
position
that
the
land
that
have
been
sold
even
within
this
that
the
reservation
are
no
longer
within
the
reservation,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

or
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
no
reservation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
would
have
island
inside
the
reservation
which
was
not
a
part
of
the
reservation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
whether
that's
right
or
wrong,
i
was
just
trying
to
get
your
position
squarely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it
were
in
an
island
you
would
say
it
was
in
the
reservation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
it's
only
on
the
boundary
line
then
where
the
land
has
been
sold
on
the
boundary
line
under
that
1906
act
if
you
say
it's
not
part
of
the
indian
reservation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
where
did
this
happen
on
east?
justice
hugo
l.
black
omak?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
all
that
land
--
has
all
the
land
in
east
omak
been
sold
to
non-indians?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
would
we
know
then
whether
--
whether
this
is
on
the
boundary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
don't
like
to
--
i
don't
want
to
bother
you
but
i
do
want
to
get
absolutely
clear.
is
it
your
position
that
all
of
the
lots
in
this
town
that
had
been
sold
to
non-indians
seized
to
be
a
part
of
the
reservation
that
those
that
indians
have
kept
are
part
of
the
reservation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
he
done
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
the
secretary
formally
created
a
new
reservation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
he
though
formally
create
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
where
we
can
find
that
spelled
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i'm
a
little
confused
because
it
seems
to
me
your
state
supreme
court
decided
the
case
on
a
different
ground,
am
i
wrong
with
that?
the
last
paragraph
said,
what
is
still
known
as
the
south
half
or
the
diminished
colville
indian
reservation
is
no
longer
an
indian
reservation
by
virtue
of
the
act
of
congress
and
president
of
the
united
states
by
a
proclamation
restored
all
of
the
south
half
or
diminished
colville
indian
reservation
to
the
public
domain
subject
only
to
the
reservation
and
allotment
of
lands
in
several
to
it
to
the
individual
indians.
i
understood
that
you
--
your
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
that
there's
a
certain
part
of
the
margin
of
this
reservation
that
is
not
--
that
have
been
excluded
from
the
reservation
that
i
understand
your
court
to
have
held
that
there
is
no
reservation
at
all,
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
read
it
as
merely
saying
it's
diminished
but
it's
saying
there's
no
longer
exist
but
even
if
that
is
true
what
you
say
is
true
it
certainly
have
as
the
most.
that
the
only
part
of
the
indian
reservation
left
that
148
or
342,000
acres
which
had
not
been
allotted,
which
had
not
been
sold
to
the
public
and
that
none
of
that
was
a
part
of
the
reservation.
that's
what
your
what
you're
holding,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
go
on
the
ground
you
are
arguing
to
us,
that
it's
just
as
marginal
cost
that
he
did
hold
that
there
are
islands
within
this
area,
that
was
not
part
of
the
reservation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
am
i
wrong
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
years
ago,
when
i
first
came
on
the
court,
when
i
knew
less
than
possible
about
indian
reservation
than
i
do
now,
i
recall
it
we
had
a
case
from
nevada
where
they
were
just
one
or
two
or
three
little
lots
down
there
and
then
was
arrested
and
tried
for
selling
liquor
but
the
question
was
whether
they're
indian
country.
as
i
recall
it,
the
court
held
unanimously
that
--
that
was
indian
country.
i
don't
see
that
case
cited.
do
you
know
what
that
case
that
was?
i
should
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
i
can't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
forgot
whether
it's
49,
i
meant
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
it
been
changed
now
that
the
general
--
that
idea
of
indian
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
so
because
i
didn't
know
enough
to
create
one.
i
thought
i'm
following
what
the
court
has
held
before
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
disturb
you
before
you
go
about
going
with
that.
i
think
it
helped
me
understand
it
better.
you
understand
the
basis
on
which
the
state
supreme
court
reads
its
conclusion
that
this
was
not
indian
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
do
either
one
that
you
show
whether
the
federal
government
has
been
prosecuting
crimes
committed
in
that
town
before
this?
