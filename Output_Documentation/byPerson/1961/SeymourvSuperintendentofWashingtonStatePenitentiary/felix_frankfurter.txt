does
the
taking
of
the
1953
act,
qualify
your
act
to
the
district
term?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1952?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
state
if
it
expressly,
focused
so
to
do
by
appropriate
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
--
contracted
in
the
north
half?
3600
in
the
north
half?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
1956
act
made
no
--
did
not
qualify
the
conditions
under
which
impediment
of
the
statute
said
was
--
was
removable
by
states,
by
the
1953
act,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
i
make
my
question
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
50
--
let's
see
if
i
get
this.
by
the
act
of
1953
some
names
states
could
remove
the
impediment
binding
their
juris
--
limiting
their
jurisdiction,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
toward
the
end,
there's
a
section
or
two
in
which
any
state
might
do
that
provided
the
state
affirmatively
make
such
accommodation
even
if
constitution
or
its
statute.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
washington
has
not
done
so
because
it
has
not
received
the
consent
of
the
colville
tribes,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
the
1956
act
doesn't
affect
that
problem,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
touch
the
problem,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
not
touch
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
problem
before
this
court
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
the
adversary
of
the
secretary
of
interior,
there
are
funds
derived
from
the
sale
of
this
property,
are
there
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
they
--
they
held
in
trust
funds
for
indian
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
happen
to
know
the
account
under
which
they
deposit
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there's
in
a
mingled
indian
fund
if
they
are
specified,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fees
are
attributable
to
funds
derived
from
properties
within
indian
territory
or
indian
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
we
hold
or
would
it
--
would
it
be
rational
or
consonant
with
general
direction
of
indian
law
to
hold
that
even
though
you
--
even
though
authorization
is
made
for
the
erection
of
townsites
to
be
treated
it
for
non-indian,
to
be
acquired
by
non-indian
and
yet
the
territory
within
that
townsites
with
the
territory,
within
which
that
townsite
exists
is
still
within
the
quote
“indian
territory”
“indian
country”
could
we
do
both
for
the
--
is
it
necessary
in
order
to
conclude
that
this
is
not
within
indian
country
to
agree
with
you
that
it
follow
from
agreeing
with
your
self-contained
townsites
therefore,
territory
within
which
it
existed
no
longer
indian
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that
if
you
duly
regard
as
i'm
sure
you
do
the
evolutionary
policies
of
--
of
withdrawing
entirely
from
a
policy
of
restrictive
indian
withdrawal
from
responsibility
and
jurisdiction
of
the
state
which
the
regulation
exists.
the
whole
tendency
has
been
to
absorb
the
indians
into
the
community
of
the
united
states.
that's
the
general
proposition,
you
would
agree
with
that,
wouldn't
you?
now,
therefore
for
that
means
the
eventual
breakup
of
reservation,
i
mean
tomorrow
but
that's
the
direction.
now,
why
can't
you
have
these
in
congress
except
your
(inaudible).
why
don't
you
have,
why
can't
you
have
this
--
we
talked
about
a
mixed
economy,
why
there's
a
mixed
indian
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
subject
to
the
governing
statute
that
there
isn't
surrender
the
(inaudible)
drawn
over
the
horse
of
the
indian
horse
so
that's
all
turn
over
to
state
jurisdiction.
that
statute
is
still
there,
isn't
it?
and
you
have
to
wipe
out
that
it
isn't
perhaps
i
think
the
chief
justice
asked
this
question.
i
think
we
do
have
to
conclude
this
is
not
indian
country
any
longer,
don't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
can't
just
say
it's
so
confused
that
in
view
of
the
confusion
that
both
either
jurisdiction
to
take
hold.
we
couldn't
decide
that,
could
you,
in
the
phase
of
the
statute
or
could
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
the
amendment,
mr.
wilkinson?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
proceed
on
the
argument
on
which
you've
been
embarked
so
i
do
not
want
to
interrupt
you.but
will
you
absorb
this
difficulty,
this
question
of
mine.
i
was
a
little
surprised
that
something
--
something
raising
a
question
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
could
then
track
what
is
within
indian
country
by
any
issue
of
any
patent
but
assume
that
that
is
so,
assume
he
could
do
that,
assume
it's
the
way
the
argument
prevails,
and
it
was
done
could
the
amendment
of
1948,
the
negro
act
can
then
undo
what
he
purported
to
do
lessen
your
strive,
would
you
take
that?
