mr.
stephen
c.
way
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
stated
very
well
the
facts
of
this
case
and
with
one
exception
i
don't
feel
it's
necessary
to
elaborate
on
it.
now,
i
think
in
order
to
have
a
full
understanding
of
this
case,
there
must
be
some
explanation
of
the
geography
involved
here.
the
town
of
omak
is
an
incorporated
town
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
washington.
the
town
of
omak
travels
the
okanogan
river.
part
of
the
town
is
on
the
west
side
of
the
okanogan
river,
the
other
portion
known
as
east
omak
where
the
crime
at
issue
in
this
case,
was
involved,
was
committed.
now,
east
omak
was
created
by
a
government
townsite
which
was
selected
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
under
the
provisions
of
section
11
of
the
act
of
march
22,
1906.
and
east
omak
shares
the
same
boundary
as
--
does
the
original
as
the
boundaries
were
drawn
by
the
executive
order
of
president
grant
in
1872.
now,
the
questions
presented
by
this
case,
the
ultimate
question
of
course
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
here
was
denied
due
process
of
law
by
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
washington
for
okanogan
county.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes,
i
have
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
--
he
relies
somewhat
on
the
same
ground
as
the
petitioner
here
that
a
continuation
of
acts
by
congress
recognizes
a
continuing
existence
and
extent
to
the
reservation.
now,
number
one,
congress
has
never
defined
what
it
means
by
a
reservation,
an
indian
reservation
at
least,
in
the
indian
law
or
the
laws
relating
to
indian
criminals
jurisdiction.
]number
two,
each
one
of
these
acts,
the
subsequent
acts
deals
not
with
the
subject
of
criminal
jurisdiction
and
at
least
two
of
those
acts,
the
act
of
march,
1918
and
the
one
in
1920
to
which
i
will
refer
later
speaks
of
the
former
colville
indian
reservation.
now,
that
certainly
does
not
show
an
intention
of
a
continuing
recognition.
and
on
those
grounds
your
honor,
we
feel
that
that
has
a
little
substance.
now,
due
process,
the
due
process
question
has
depended
of
course
on
whether
or
not
the
united
states
court
or
the
state
courts
had
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
and
this
is
dependent
upon
an
interpretation
principally
of
section
1151
and
1153
of
title
18.
1153
is
the
so-called
major
crimes
act
which
let's
say
number
of
crimes,
one
of
which
is
burglary
which
no
doubt
includes
the
lesser
--
included
offense
of
attempted
burglary
which
was
committed
here.
now,
1153
in
order
for
jurisdiction
to
best
in
the
united
states
court,
the
crime
must
have
been
committed
in
indian
country.
now,
i
believe
it
is
clear
that
even
a
crime
is
committed
by
an
indian
on
lands
clearly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
that
there
is
no
question
as
to
whether
or
not
that
court
might
assume
the
jurisdiction.
now,
section
1151
provides
indian
country
a
means
all
land
within
the
limits
of
any
indian
reservation
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
government.
now,
as
i
pointed
out,
congress
has
not
indicated
what
it
means
by
an
indian
reservation.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
definition
is
a
subject
for
judicial
determination.
now,
the
act
of
march
22,
1906,
opened
to
sale,
entry,
and
settlement
by
non-indians
large
portions
of
the
colville.
now,
we
submit
your
honors
that
it
is
inconsistent
to
maintain
that
the
lands
so
sold
and
settled
upon
can
be
set
aside
for
the
use
and
occupancy
of
indians
and
at
the
same
time
for
the
use
and
occupancy
of
non-indians.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes
your
honor
that
is
our
position.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
we
contend
this
your
honor
that
the
act
of
march
22,
1906
which
opened
the
reservation
to
sale
and
entry
and
those
lands
which
were
sold
and
entered
upon
cannot
be
longer
indian
country
or
within
indian
reservation
and
the
act
had
the
effect
of
separating
those
lands
so
sold
and
settled
upon
and
they
no
longer
were
a
part
of
the
reservation
and
the
act
had
the
effect
of
redefining
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
submit
your
honor
that
under
the
language
of
section
1151,
if
there
is
an
island
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
submit
your
honor,
if
the
redefinition
of
the
boundaries
and
there
is
a
land
settled
upon
by
a
non-indian
which
sort
of
creates
island
then
it
would
be
within
indian
country.
but
it's
my
understanding
that
most
of
this
land
lies
on
the
perimeter
of
the
reservation
along
the
okanogan,
along
the
shores
of
the
columbia
and
the
san
poil
rivers.
now,
(voice

especially
as
i
pointed
out
the
town
of
east
omak
or
that
portion
of
the
town
of
omak
which
is
east
omak
shares
the
same
boundary
as
originally
described
in
the
executive
order
therefore,
it
could
not
create
an
island.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
would
your
honor,
yes.
under
the
language
of
congress
(voice

--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
east,
east
omak
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
cannot
answer
that
with
(inaudible)
certainty
that
all
of
the
land
was
sold
to
non-indians
no,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
well,
as
i
said
earlier,
and
i
will
come
to
this
later,
section
11
of
the
act
are
required
the
or
authorized,
might
i
say,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
create
townsites
for
the
quote
“future
public
interest”
and
to
make
such
reservations
or
parts
or
other
survey
in
to
lots
and
blocks,
sell
the
same
under
his
regulations
that
money
so
received
to
be
paid
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
under
section
6
of
the
act.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
its
population
is
probably
300
people.
it
comprises
an
area,
i
would
say,
of
two
square
miles.
it
has
within
its
boundaries
two
groceries
stores,
two
restaurants,
a
large
lumber
mill,
a
fruit
warehouse,
a
railroad,
the
city
park,
the
rodeo
grounds,
a
public
school.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
no,
it
is
not
mr.
justice
black.
in
section
11
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
certainly
not.
but
here
under
section
11,
there's
authority
in
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
create
another
reservation
for
the
future
public
interest,
not
the
indian
interest,
the
future
public
interest.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes,
he
has
your
honor
and
the
townsite
plot
has
been
filed
with
the
auditor
of
--
the
county
auditor
of
okanogan
county.
and
when
it
was
so
filed,
it
became
dedicated
to
the
future
public
interest.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
--
your
honor
it's
been
filed
as
an
exhibit
in
this
case
along
with
the
original
deed
to
the
land
in
question
here
and
that
is
lot
9,
block
118
of
the
government
townsite
of
omak.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
that
is
in
essence
what
the
section
11
provides.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
(voice

he
formally
had
consent
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes
mr.
justice
black
he
did.
it
was
cert
--
no,
by
survey
lots
parcels
even
like
you
have
in
the
city
of
washington
d.c.
allot
100

wide,
number
nine,
300
feet
long,
streets
--
streets
are
set
out.
mr.
stephen

yes
he
had.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
no,
it's
laid
out
as
a
community
with
streets,
alleyways,
places
for
sidewalks
and
lots
individually
numbered
(voice

within

mr.
stephen
c.
way
the
--
a
copy
of
the
plot
has
been
filed
as
an
exhibit
here.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
the
lots
were
sold
in
both
1916
and
1919,
i
believe.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
believe
it
was
1960
and
i
don't
accurately
recall
of.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
well,
i
maintain
your
honor
and
we
maintain
that
the
act
on
march
22
in
its
entirety
and
in
particular
section
11
has
the
effect
of
redefining
the
boundaries.
now,
if
for
chance
it
--
it
should
create
or
there
should
be
an
island,
the
language
of
section
1151,
all
land
within
the
limits,
now,
if
the
limits
are
re-described
and
it
happens
that
there
is
an
island
then
it
would
be
within
the
re-described
boundaries.
so,
that
is
my
conclusion
of
after
study
of
this.
but
your
honor.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
stephen
c.
way
now,
the
petitioner
and
both
--
and
the
solicitor
general
as
well
in
their
briefs
submit
that
the
subsequent
acts
of
congress
recognized
a
continuing
existence
and
extent
of
the
reservation.
two
of
these
acts,
the
act
of
march
11,
1918
and
the
act
of
march
19,
1920
in
their
titles
refer
to
the
former
colville
indian
reservation.
both
of
these
acts
extended
the
times
for
the
payments
to
be
made
by
persons
who
have
purchased
lands
under
the
opening
of
the
reservation
by
the
act
of
march
22,
1906.
certainly,
this
is
not
a
--
an
expression
of
congressional
intent
of
a
continuing
existence
and
extent
of
the
reservation.
it
would
seem
to
be
a
contrary
expression
that
there
is
an
intention
or
an
expression
that
the
colville
does
not
continue
to
the
same
extent
as
prior
to
the
more
--
act
of
march
22.
now,
(voice

further
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes,
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
do
not
know
with
certainty
but
i
presume
that
they
do
refer
to
the
colville
indian
agency
on
the
colville
reservation
such
language
of
that.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes,
they
do.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
they
are
under
the
act
to
be
expended
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
for
per
capita
payments.
the
money
is
received
for
the
sale
of
these
lands
or
to
be
deposited
in
this
--
in
the
treasury
and
to
be
expended
by
the
secretary
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
no
i
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
--
well,
i
have
no
knowledge
of
what
account
it
might
be.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
well,
it's
--
the
money
is
received
from
the
sale
of
the
lands
under
the
act
of
march
22
or
to
be
deposited
and
expended
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
and
to
make
for
per
capita
payments
to
the
indians.
now,
an
additional
act
of
congress,
the
act
of
august
31,
1916
amended
the
act
of
march
22,
1906,
prohibiting
the
introduction
of
intoxicants
into
the
land
sold
and
disposed
of
under
the
act
in
the
townsites
created
under
section
11.
now,
if
congress
by
this
act
intended
to
make
an
expression
of
continuing
existence
of
the
reservation,
this
amendment
was
completely
superpose
for
the
indian
liquor
laws
already
covered
the
subject.
and
certainly,
this
is
not
an
expression
of
congressional
intent
of
a
continuing
existence
of
the
reservation.
now,
there
is
also
confusion
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
united
states
government
concerning
this
continuing
existence
of
the
colville.
in
a
memorandum
dated
september
28,
1939
from
the
acting
secretary
of
the
interior
to
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
which
is
found
on
page
41
of
the
petitioner's
brief
states
in
part,
“in
my
opinion,
the
act
authorizing
the
sale
of
surplus
land
of
the
colville
indian
reservation
has
the
effect
of
redefining
boundaries
of
the
reservation.”
this
demonstrates
that
the
issue
was
not
quite
so
clear
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
would
appear
to
contend
at
least
on
that
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
think
it
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
--
could
be
sustained
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
think
it
could
be
if
you
should
base
your
decision
on
the
fact
that
section
11
creates
a
reservation
within
the
reservation
and
it
must
have
been
congress'
intention
to
separate
townsites
created
under
this
authority
then
i
think
that
it
could
be
held
that
the
remainder
of
the
reservation
still
exists
or
that
subject
does
not
have
to
be
touched.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
it
does
seem
to
me
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
it
would
be
possible
to
say
at
one
and
the
same
time
that
we
have
here
a
reservation
created
for
the
future
public
interest
and
the
same
time,
a
reservation
for
the
use
of
indians.
the
proposition
is
in
congress.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
presume
you
can
have
mr.
justice
frankfurter
those
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
maintained
that
that
conclusion
seems
to
follow
from
what
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
well,
i
think
it
--
it
must
presumed
that
congress
intended
the
results
that
is
achieved
its
acts
and
the
results
and
consequences
of
the
act
of
march
22,
1906,
i
think
it
must
be
interpreted
that
they
so
intended
that
the
result
would
be
the
separation.
and
i
find
that
no
other
interpretation
of
the
act
then
a
--
an
intention
upon
the
part
of
congress
to
separate
these
lands
and
as
a
result,
making
a
redefinition
of
the
--
of
the
boundaries.
now,
taking
a
look
at
the
act
of
march
22,
1906,
the
secretary
--
the
act
affects
every
piece
of
ground
within
the
colville.
it
requires
the
secretary
to
sell
and
dispose
of
all
unreserved
and
unallotted
lands,
requires
him
to
survey
every
piece
of
land
on
the
colville
to
classify
the
lands
as
to
whether
there
are
irrigable
area
or
grazing
and
so
forth.
and
upon
the
completion
of
the
classification
to
appraise
the
land
as
to
their
value
and
thereafter
to
make
allotments
of
land
to
every
member
of
the
tribe
having
tribal
related
and
they
have
to
issue
patents.
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
reserve
lands
for
school,
religious
and
other
indian
purposes.
the
proceeds
of
the
sales
are
to
be
expended
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
and
for
per
capita
payments,
and
as
i
have
referred
to
earlier
to
reserve
lands
for
townsite
purposes
for
the
future
public
interest.
this
act
makes
a
very
obviously
fundamental
and
basic
change
to
the
colville
reservation.lands
formally
devoted
to
the
use
and
occupancy
of
indians
are
now
and
have
become
lands
devoted
to
the
use
and
occupancy
of
non-indians.
how
then
can
the
visitation
upon
these
lands
of
such
a
fundamental
transformation
by
the
force
and
effect
of
this
act?
mr.
stephen
c.
way
--
enable
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
well,
the
--
how
can
this
transformation
of
the
lands
by
the
force
of
this
act
enable
the
lands
to
retain
their
character
as
indian
reservation
lands
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
congressional
definition
in
the
criminal
laws
and
convincing
such
a
change
as
it's
found
here.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
not
in
specific
language
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes
sir.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
there
is
no
specific
portion
of
it
redefining
geographically
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
--
new
boundaries.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
the
decision
of
the
washington
supreme
court
does
hold
as
i
understand
it
that
the
act
of
march
22,
1906
diminished
the
reservation
to
the
extent
with
the
exception
of
those
lands
reserved
for
indian
purposes
and
allotments
and
severalty
to
the
indians.
now,
i
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes
sir,
judge
wicks
appear
to
hold
that
way.
the
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
am
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
--
trying
to
take
it
from
two
--
in
two
--
two
directions.
one,
that
the
act
itself
had
the
effect
of
diminishing
the
reservation
subject
only
to
those
lands
reserved
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
colville
indian
tribes
and
the
lands
that
which
were
allotted.
and
secondly,
that
in
any
event,
the
creation
of
this
reservation
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
the
future
public
interest
in
which
this
reservation
of
the
townsite
of
omak,
within
which
the
crime
was
committed
in
any
event
was
a
creation
of
another
reservation
for
the
future
public
interest
and
by
that
alone,
a
separation
of
the
situs
of
this
crime
from
the
reservation.
i
think
attacked
two
ways.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
well,
no
but
i
can
recall
the
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
--
which
i
remember
the
ninth
circuit
court
called
49
bottles
of
sour
mash
whisky
which
sounds
to
be
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
sounds
to
be
that
sort
of
case
but
i
didn't
think
it
was
appropriate
for
the
reasons
it
was
involved
the
indian
liquor
laws
and
the
definition
at
that
time
was
substantially
different
than
what
is
found
in
1151.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
the
indian
country
definition
there
i
thought
was
more
of
the
creation
by
this
court
rather
than
--
now,
it's
defined
by
statute
where
(voice

--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
i
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
within
the
town
of
east
omak
which
is
apart
of
the
town
of
omak
itself
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
--
the
incorporated
town.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
all
of
the
services
are
provided
which
are
provided
to
the
persons
who
live
on
the
other
side
of
the
realm.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
on
the
west
side.
mr.
stephen
c.
way
that's
not
--
mr.
stephen
c.
way
yes.
all
the
fire
protection,
police
protection,
there
is
a
public
school,
the
public
park
is
in
east
omak,
all
of
the
services
which
the
people
on
the
other
side
of
river
get
also
are
given
to
the
people
who
reside
in
east
omak.
