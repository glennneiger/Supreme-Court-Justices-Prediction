mr.

may

mr.
ralph
e.
moody
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
--
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
a
certain
factual
situation
that
was
discussed
here
by
counsels
for
the
appellant
metlakatla
indian
community.
i
think
we
should
clear
it
up
from
the
standpoint
as
the
state
sees
it,
that
is
relative
to
the
matter
of
support
to
schools
and
a
matter
of
health
in
the
state.
now
as
indicated
in
previous
argument
here,
the
state
does
operate
the
schools
and
also
furnishes
health
facilities
in
the
village
in
metlakatla
and
on
the
island.
and
now,
in
one
of
the
exhibits
to
the
reply
brief
of
the
appellants
metlakatla,
there
is
a
letter
from,
i
believe
the
department
of
--
united
states
department
of
education
which
indicated
that
practically
all
of
the
moneys
for
the
operation
of
the
school
in
metlakatla
and
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
in
kake
and
--
and
angoon
were
furnished
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
or
under
the
--
the
–
o'malley
act.
i
believe
it's
another
prefix
term
in
(inaudible).
now
that
is
true
–that
is
true
in
metlakatla,
that
is
true
kake
and
angoon,
that
is
true
in
regard
to
many
of
the
areas
of
alaska,
though
practically
all
of
the
school
moneys
are
furnished
by
the
federal
government
based
upon
the
impact
of
--
of
people
in
the
federal
service
such
as
military
personnel
that
are
on
anchorage
in
fairbanks
and
the
employees
living
on
federal
lands.
as
the
court
realizes
until
statehood
not
more
than
99%
of
all
the
lands
of
alaska
that
was
federally
owned,
even
after
--
even
after
the
land
is
selected
by
the
state,
it
was
granted
to
us
under
the
statehood
act
in
which
we
have
a
period
of
25
years
to
select
in
excess
of
100-million
acres
of
land.
almost
75%
of
the
state
was
still
owned
by
the
federal
government.
so,
this
is
not
unusual
in
the
fact
that
metlakatla
and
in
kake
and
angoon
which
are
on
federal
lands
furnished
practically
all
of
the
school
moneys
by
the
federal
government
under
an
act
that
also
allows
the
federal
government
to
furnish
mo
--
money
to
own
bay
schools
in
anchorage
area
and
to
the
--
which
are
also
run
by
the
state,
they
are
federal
--
federal
military
reservations,
schools
were
run
by
the
state.
and
the
--
the
money
is
furnished
by
the
federal
government
because
it
is
of
the
impact
to
the
federal
people
who
are
temporary
in
alaska.
now,
in
the
city
of
the
anchorage,
we
have
many
families
who
were
living
off
of
the
(inaudible)
and
who
are
living
on
–
they're
maybe
living
on
the
federal
lands,
that's
not
privately
owned,
in
those
--
such
as
the
alaska
railroad
own
--
owned
land,
people
were
living
on
that.
the
money
is
contributed
to
the
federal
government
to
run
the
schools.
so
there's
nothing
unique
in
the
--
in
the
situation
that
the
federal
government
either
through
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
are
--
on
a
similar
legislation,
furnishes
money
to
the
state's
schools,
but
they
are
all
run
under
the
--
on
direction
of
the
state
department
of
education.
now
i
believe
also,
in
--
in
his
opening
statement
that
the
counsel
for
the
appellants
of
metlakatla
indicated
that,
when
metlakatla
reservation
is
set
aside
that
--
that
was
set
aside
only
for
indians,
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
believe,
set
aside
also
on
certain
--
set
aside
for
eskimos
and
aleuts
who
--
who
may
join
the
indians
from
time
to
time.
there
are
a
few
--
have
been
a
few
eskimos
and
aleuts
on
metlakatla
--
some
of
them
in
fact
served
on
the
--
on
the
counsel
of
the
community.
now,
as
indicated
--
indicated
by
the
appellants,
the
claim
of
the
metlakatla
indian
community
is
based
upon
three
--
two
acts
of
congress
and
one
presidential
and
executive
order;
the
1891
act,
the
presidential
proclamation
of
1916,
the
reaffirmance
of
this
proclamation
of
1916
by
an
act
of
congress
in
1934.
a
question
was
asked
a
few
moments
ago
relative
to
the
effect
of
the
white
act
upon
the
presidential
proclamation
of
1916,
i
think
it
could
very
well
have
been
--
have
been
argued
that
in
absence
of
the
act
of
1934
which
reaffirmed
the
presidential
proclamation
of
1916
setting
aside
the
3,000
reservations
around
metlakatla,
that
the
white
act
would
have
done
with
the
reservation.
state
is
not
contending
that.
i
think
--
i
think
it's
very
reasonable
that
--
that
it
can
be
argued
and
rightly
so
that
under
the
1934
act
which
have
ratified
the
presidential
proclamation
of
the
(inaudible).
there
--
there's
no
question
that
that
is
still
an
existence
because
the
subsequent
act
(inaudible).
traditionally,
the
indians
of
alaska
have
been
treated,
as
all
other
alaskans.
they
have
and
i
am
speaking
her
now
particularly
metlakatla
the
--
the
following.
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
we're
not
conceding
that.
i
am
saying
that
the
--
i'm
saying
it's
possible
to
argue
that
it
--
that
it
made
--
that
it
may
have
been
extinguished
by
the
white
act,
but
it
could
also
be
very
possibly
argued
that
the
1934
act
would
have
reinstituted
it
and
--
and
kept
it
in
to
--
in
effect.
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
well,
of
course
the
position
that
we
take
–
that
we
take
on
this
point
is
that
even
if
the
reservation
is
still
in
existence
and
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
we're
conceding
it
may
still
be
in
existence,
but
only
--
but
the
reservation
is
only
an
area
reservation
which
gives
them
the
exclusive
right
to
fish
but
does
not
give
them
--
does
not
give
the
federal
government
the
exclusive
right
to
regulate,
in
other
words,
an
area
in
which
only
the
metlakatlas
can
fish.
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
yes,
it
--
it
would
depend
upon
the
interpretation
of
section
4.
we
contend
however
that
the
--
that
the
matter
of
--
that
the
rights
reserved
under
section
4
in
the
statehood
act
is
a
right
to
fish
exclusively
in
there
as
against
anyone
other
than
the
members
of
the
metlakatla
tribe,
but
that
it
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
preserved
their
method
and
means
of
fishing.
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
well,
i
think
this
--
i
think
there
are
similar
factors
we
can
consider
there
to
sustain
the
state's
view.
first
is
that
before
statehood,
all
territorial
laws
which
were
passed
to
the
territorial
legislature
as
distinguished
from
acts
of
congress
were
enforced
against
the
metlakatlans,
criminal
and
civil,
without
any
distinction,
not
only
the
major
crimes
act,
but
all
crimes,
misdemeanors,
and
felonies
were
enforced
under
that.
now,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
section
60
of
the
statehood
act
also
and
look
at
the
intent
of
congress
in
this
matter
of
what
was
fishing
rights
--
what
they
had
in
mind
with
these
fishing
rights
at
the
time
they
passed
the
statehood
act.
under
section
6
(e)
of
the
statehood
act,
congress
turned
over
to
this
new
state
of
alaska
all
equipment
used
in
the
co
--
in
the
regulation
and
conservation
of
the
fisheries
which
they
then
had.
it
appears
to
me,
we
could
not
reasonably
say
that
congress
would
have
turned
over
all
their
necessary
equipment
to
conserve
and
regulate
the
fisheries
if
they
were
going
to
retain
half
of
the
fisheries
in
the
state,
or
any
portion
of
the
fisheries,
but
they
turned
over
all
of
the
equipment.
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
that
--
that
is
true.
however,
that
would
--
that
would
limit
it
--
speaking
only
of
metlakatla,
that
would
limit
the
effect
of
turning
over
all
the
equipment
but
by
the
same
token,
we've
got
several
thousand
square
miles
of
--
of
area
to
be
policed
to
keep
up
out
third
parties
as
against
the
--
as
against
the
metlakatlans,
plus
you've
got
that
area
to
regulate
as
to
whether
they're
fishing
in
there
was
other
type
of
the
--
what
the
types
of
equipment
they're
fishing
with.
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
do
you
mean
the
regulation
of
the
--
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
do
you
mean
the
--
the
regulation
of
the
--
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
oh,
the
water
area?
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
apparently,
that
is
obviously
one
of
the
questions
--
one
of
the
questions
involved
here
because
we
have
--
we
have
tried
to
eliminate
the
fish
trap.
now,
the
other
--
another
question
that
came
up
is
to
the
other
type
of
fishing,
insofar
as
i
know
--
insofar
as
i
know
they
have
–
the
state
has
been
regulating
the
other
types
of
fisheries
in
there.
there's
been
--
no
question
has
been
raised.
in
fact,
this
is
not
for
the
court
within
the
last
two
years,
we
have
had
a
couple
of
metlakatlans
for
fishing
wi
--
without
licenses
in
the
area
before
the
state
courts.
there
are
no
--
no
question
has
been
raised,
so
far
that
question
may
be
raised.
i
mean,
i'm
not
saying
it
won't
be
--
but
to
the
present
time,
it
hasn't
been
raised.
we
have
--
we
have
complete
jurisdiction
both
civil
and
criminal,
and
always
have
had
prior
to
the
statehood
and
have
at
the
present
time.
they've
never
questioned
it.
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
that
is
correct
and
we
think,
mr.
justice,
it's
a
very,
very
valuable
right,
a
very
valuable
right
in
the
economic
standpoint
of
metlakatla
and
we
think
that's
all
that
congress
intended.
now,
we
concede
they
could
have
gone
further
but
we
--
but
we
--
we
contend
this
that
congress
had
intended
to
give
them
--
give
them
more,
they
should
have
set
it
out
clearly
and
would
have
set
it
out
clearly.
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
over
all
rights,
that's
--
that's
the
question
we
are
here
to
determine,
as
i
understand,
as
to
what
the
right
is.
where
--
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
well,
that's
right
but
the
--
but
the
--
i'm
assuming
here
that
the
only
right
granted
was
a
right
--
the
right
to
--
for
them
to
fish
exclusively
and
not
the
right
that
congress
did
not
reserve
the
right
to
regulate.
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
that's
exactly
right.
and
of
--
of
course,
as
indicated
in
the
previous
arguments
here,
the
secretary
of
interior
has
never
made
any
distinction
in
the
past
whether
it's
in
this
area
of
metlakatla
or
whether
it's
in
the
area
of
kake
and
angoon,
wherever
it
might
be
as
to
the
method,
the
times
and
--
of
fishing,
but
whether
be
by
indians,
non-indians,
or
whoever
they
might
be.
and
we
think
its
--
that
we
think
that
--
that
our
proposed
interpretation
to
what
a
fishing
right
is
in
this
regard
relative
to
the
fish
traps
is
consistent
with
the
long
interpretation
or
the
long
policy
of
congress
with
department
of
interior,
in
connection
with
the
indians
and
their
fishing
rights
in
alaska.
now,
going
little
more
into
the
background
as
to
the
relationship
of
the
metlakatla
community
in
the
state
of
alaska,
and
we
have
set
this
out
in
our
--
our
brief,
i
may
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
again
is
the
fact
that
traditionally,
the
alaska
legislature,
because
of
depressed
areas
in
the
state
have
set
--
have
set
aside
to
the
executive
at
each
legislative
session
certain
funds
for
depressed
areas
to
be
given
up
by
the
executive
as
the
situation
arises.
in
the
year
1961,
the
appellant
community
was
granted
$8,000
economic
aid
from
state
general
funds
and
there
were
some
20
communities
involved
and
metlakatla
was
approximately
1,000
inhabitants,
got
this
second
highest
allotment
of
--
of
any
of
the
communities
in
alaska.
so
they've
been
treated
by
the
legislature,
by
the
executive
all
along
on
equal
footing
from
the
standpoint
of
economic
aid,
from
the
standpoint
of
citizens,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
courts,
and
their
jurisdiction
over
them.
and
this
is
the
first
time,
this
is
first
time
under
territorial
status
or
under
states
status
that
the
metlakatla
which
we
have
conceded
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
is
a
reserve,
has
never
raised
the
question
of
any
state
jurisdiction
in
regards
to
civil
or
criminal
matters
of
whatever
nature
and
it
appears,
to
me,
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
--
the
long
policy
of
the
federal
government
and
the
department
of
interior
by
the
position
they
are
now
taking.
as
indicated
previously,
we
--
we
concede
that
federal
government
has
power
to
treat
indian
reservations
in
the
state
or
territory
which
we
feel
are
all
regula
--
regulatory
authorities,
but
in
this
case,
we
feel
that
the
congress
does
not
seem
fit
to
go
the
full
distance
on
the
merit.
that
that
they
have
only
set
aside
an
area
exclusively
for
the
use
of
these
people
in
fishing,
but
they
left
the
matter
of
regulation
with
the
state
which
have
been
through
in
many
instances,
and
many
phases
of
economic
and
social
life
in
alaska
throughout
the
years.
mr.
ralph
e.
moody
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
(inaudible).
there
was
no
question
ever
raised,
it
would
always
had
full
jurisdiction
over
it.
as
i
understand
the
1953
act,
only
gave
that
right
to
take
jurisdiction
where
it
never
existed
before.
we've
are
always
had
--
we
always
had
that
authority.
it's
never
been
questioned.
so
no
action
has
been
taken.
in
the
answering
brief
of
the
appellant
metlakatla
community
in
this
case
on
page
2
and
3
of
their
reply
brief,
they
asked
the
state
to
indicate
what
federal
authorities
has
made
the
decisions
that
fishing
within
reserves
to
be
regulated
on
a
uniform
system
of
regulation.
although,
we
do
not
feel
that
this
is
incumbent
upon
us,
the
appellees
in
the
matter,
we're
certainly
be
glad
to
indicate
our
--
our
thoughts
in
the
matter.
we
point
to
the
presidential
proclamation
of
1916
which
is
number
1332,
set
out
in
39,
statute
1777
where
it
was
stated
that
lands
were
reserved
for
the
benefit
of
the
metlakatlans
and
such
other
alaskan
natives
as
of
--
joined
them
or
may
join
them,
and
residents
on
these
(inaudible)
to
be
used
by
them
under
the
general
fisheries
laws
and
regulations
of
the
united
states
as
administered
by
the
secretary
of
commerce,
of
course
which
was
changed
under
the
reorganization
by
the
secretary
of
interior.
and
the
--
then
the
act
of
1934
which
in
part
says,
“and
any
reservation
heretofore
made
by
any
act
of
congress
or
executive
order
or
proclamation
for
the
benefit
of
said
indians,
shall
continue
in
full
force
and
effect
and
shall
continue
to
be
subject
to
modification,
alteration,
or
appeal
by
congress
or
the
president,
respectively.”
now,
the
--
the
--
this
president
proclamation,
this
act
of
1934
is
still
in
effect
and
it's
--
if
you
will
look
at
the
--
on
page
20
--
43
of
the
appellants
reply
in
--
in
their
brief,
not
the
reply
brief,
but
in
their
original
brief,
they
state,
“moreover,
the
congressional
ratification
of
the
proclamation
in
1934,
most
clearly
placed
executive
action,
our
statute
on
par
with
the
1891
law.”
we
agree
with
this
statement
and
we
agree
that
the
act
of
1934
confirmed
the
presidential
proclamation
of
1916
which
said
that
the
fishing
in
these
waters
would
be
on
--
on
par
with
all
other
fishers
--
fishermen
in
the
area.
now
they've
indicated
--
the
appellants
have
indicated
that
they're,
“we
may
not
regulate
fisheries
in
reserve
on
the
doctrine
of
preemption.”
they
suggest
an
irreconcilable
conflict
has
arisen
between
the
two
sovereigns,
and
as
a
result
the
state
power
must
yield
to
federal
authority.
the
fallacy
of
this
argument
is
–
the
will
--
the
secretary
of
interior
does
not
constitute
the
will
of
government.
the
secretary
has
not
based
his
regulation
on
his
own
desire
he
says,
but
in
the
way
he
believes
to
be
the
will
of
congress
that
is
expressed
in
section
4
of
the
statehood
act.
now
as
to
his
own
authority,
he
said
he
has,
section
4
of
the
statehood
act
as
to,
in
regard
to
any
rights
that
they
might
have
been
established
under
white
act.
mr.
gross
has
covered
that
and
we
contend
no
right
was
established
under
the
white
act.
the
only
thing
that
was
established
under
white
act
in
connection
with
these
fishers
were
that
they
fish
on
par
with
everyone
else
in
the
alaskan
waters.
if
the
state
suggests
interpretation
of
section
4
of
statehood
act
is
correct,
that
only
congress
preserved
the
status
quo,
that
is
the
only
the
right
(inaudible)
exclusive
use
of
the
waters
to
fish
in,
subject
to
statehood
act
to
regulate
the
manner
and
means
of
taking
its
--
taking
it
on
the
on
the
general
fisheries
law,
it
follows
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
invalid,
and
no
question
of
preemption
arise.
there
must
be
clear
and
equivocal
expression
of
congressional
will
by
congress,
if
state
power
is
to
be
preemptive
and
we
submit
that
there
has
been
no
clear
congressional
action
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
the
policy
of
congress,
the
secretary
of
interior
prior
to
statehood
has
just
--
has
been
just
opposite
to
what
the
secretary's
action
was
in
this
case
in
allowing
along
the
fish
trap.
and
we
contend
therefore
that
the
--
any
regulation
he
has
promulgated
to
allow
fish
traps
is
invalid
and
of
no
effect
and
therefore,
the
state
has
a
right
to
regulate.
we
therefore
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judge's
dismissal.
