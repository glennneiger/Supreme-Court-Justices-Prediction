justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
that
(inaudible)
small
blue
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
an
earlier
one
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
last
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
statute
apply
merely
to
these
three
indian
communities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
prohibitions
against
the
use
of
traps.
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
these
three?
are
there
any
other?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
have
a
hard
time,
don't
you?
do
you
have
a
hard
time
in
this
crossfire,
don't
you?
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
is
the
text
of
that
statute
set
forth
please?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
enactment
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
the
original.
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
1953
and
this
is
19
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
that
any
rights
under
federal
treaty,
agreement
or
statute
would
cover
such
discretionally
power
that
the
secretary
has
on
the
statute
if
it's
their
right
to
recognize
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
says
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
--
where
is
that
set
forth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
--
i
notice
that
the
statehood
act
was
prior
in
time
for
the
amendment
of
the
right
--
that
is
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
if
one
has
to
go
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
becomes
a
material
the
statehood
act
proceeding,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
drawing
inferences.
i
just
want
to
follow
this
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that's
--
isn't
the
adjective
absolute
rather
unusual
in
these
reservation
clauses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
all
the
statehood
act,
really?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
burden
of
this
case
is
the
native
man,
but
would
you
mind
in
--
for
instance
is
to
say
what
--
what
was
left
because
that's
--
with
reference
the
public,
the
governmental
domain
other
than
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
we're
not
concerned
with
the
--
just
curiosity,
would
that
mean
that
so
called
police
power
of
alaska
can
extend
--
extend
to
government
land?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
once
an
amendment
does
really
amend,
doesn't
it?
i
say,
for
once
an
amendment
does
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
a
territory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
ought
to
know
but
i
don't
mr.
schifter,
what
is
the
indian
population
relation
in
total,
for
the
white
population
so
called
white
population?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
37,000
out
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
but,
there
was
very
distinguish
men
partaking
of
this
oversize,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
here,
it
was
over
the
whole
of
alaska
into
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
as
to
alaska;
that
was
all
governed
from
the
interior
department.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
never
get
it
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
far
is
the
central
government,
the
united
states
government
and
oversize
of
alaska,
it
was
the
positive
(inaudible)
secretary
of
interior.
justice
felix
frankfurter
again
an
organized
community
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
refresh
my
recollection,
what's
your
total
population?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
are
there
rights
strictly,
closely
restricted
from
your
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

existent
at
the
time
of
the
act.
in
other
words,
could
he
oppose
--
suppose
some
other
fishing
devices
were
invented?
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
electronic
device,
could
the
--
could
the
secretary
of
the
interior
confer
new
opportunities
to
your
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
power
to
fix
to
the
land.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

fix
to
the
land.
i
think
that's
your
view
that
sets
the
land
shall
be
remain
under
(inaudible)
jurisdiction,
so
within
its
territory,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
the
master
because
united
states
is
the
master.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cragun,
may
i
hold
you
up
for
one
more
second
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
have
you
to
tell
me
that
what
to
relation
of
the
catch
of
these
three
communities,
traps
catches
is
the
total
fish
economy
of
alaska?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
did
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
2%
of
the
total?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
you'll
have
time
enough
left
to
say
your
piece
about
equal
footing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
more
important
point
mr.
cragun?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this
question.
there
were
no
treaties
between
and
these
communities,
were
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
i
would
like
to
ask
you,
what
is
the
transcending
authority,
constitutional
authority
of
the
united
states
in
relation
to
have
a
regular
indians
in
alaska
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
he
can
go
beyond
the
number
within
the
territorial
limits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well,
now
just
go
beyond
that
--
beyond
the
21
fixed
sites.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
include
also
the
question
i
put
to
mr.
cragun,
a
change
in
the
method
even
at
those
fixed
sites
electronic
as
justice
douglas
(inaudible)
changed,
that's
not
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
question
has
not
stirred
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
why
you're
saying
not
vested.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
vested
against
alaska?
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
true
of
metlakatla.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
of
your
argument
is
you're
trying
to
fix
that
established
what
interest
they
enjoyed
as
of
the
date
of
statehood.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
at
large,
you
might
not
be
able
catch
it.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis
--
mr.
davis,
in
fishing
rights
broadly
speaking,
the
opportunity
to
catch
fish,
i'm
not
offering
this
for
technical.
let's
say
an
indication
then
whether
traps
other
deemed
at
the
interior's
instruments
(inaudible)
for
instance,
having
conservation
instrument
are
means
for
enabling
(inaudible)
fish
would
--
would
be
raised
on
this
--
on
the
basis
of
ultra
vires
of
the
secretary
would
implement
that
authority
that
he
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
could
be
done
either
if
the
court
take
judicial
notice
that
traps
are
destructive
implements
all
by
proof?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
you
are
syaing
congress
considered
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
broad
statue
--
unlimiting
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
leaving
his
conduct
subject
to
attack
in
a
way
which
authorized
conduct
by
executive
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
that
--
am
i
going
to
refer
from
that,
that
although
there
is
no
regulation
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
alaska
would
be
without
power
evoked
by
under
its
police
power
to
be
with
the
proper
--
with
a
problem
like
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
absence
of
it
and
his
appeal
is
free
until
the
--
either
congress
or
secretary
acts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
date
mr.
gross?
what's
the
date
of
the
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
that
extent,
that
was
an
amendment
of
the
white
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
get
into
trouble,
don't
you?
i
think
(inaudible)
construe,
alright,
go
on
so
let's
see
the
rest
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
it
say
the
salmon
fishery?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
tell
me
that's
outside
the
white
act
for
different
reason?
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
commercial
--
is
that
a
commercial
fishery?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
a
monopoly
was
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
is
that
contesting
with
the
white
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
â€“
there
was
an
implied
amendment
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
assume
you
would
avoid
getting
in
to
that
conclusion
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
very
case,
section
4
that
we
have
got
a
white
act
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
--
but
it
--
but
it
withheld
that
repeal
in
order
to
keep
within
federal
authority,
protection
of
the
indians.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
the
government
said
not
only
in
the
same
area,
not
only
that
this
a
geographic
term
--
geographically
bounded,
but
also,
there
would
have
to
be
an
existence
of
the
term
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
only
--
they
thought
certainly
not
more
than
21
sites
and
they
quoted
the
department
of
interior
as
construing
it
to
mean
the
existing
available
types.
justice
felix
frankfurter
less
than
21.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
there's
no
more
than
21
under
any
construction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
vise-versa,
or
vise-versa
or
the
reverse
is
equally
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
not
reserved,
then
we
can't
scrutinize
whether
your
right
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
well
i'm
certain,
i
can
infer
from
that
that
if
these
claims,
they
are
sustained
as
fishing
rights
in
half
the
industry
of
the
state,
there
will
similar
claims
of
fishing
rights?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
mentioning
that
into
actuality,
does
that
mean
that
there
are
outstand
--
there
were
outstanding,
as
of
1959,
rights
comparable
to
these
rights
in
regard
to
half
of
the
industry
of
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
does
the
state
say
that
in
fact
there
were
in
use,
frozen
by
the
claim
of
the
government
now,
fishing
rights
that
would
make
the
kind
of
divisions
in
--
if
i
may
use
the
word
again,
natives
and
the
non-natives?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
what
i'm
asking
you
is
whether
there
are
--
there's
a
factual
basis
per
se
that
if
these
claims
are
recognized,
then
there
are
claims
to
the
extent
of
half
the
fishing
industry
of
alaska,
outside
of
the
control
of
alaska.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
hypothetically,
not
argumentatively
--
but
in
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
those
--
are
those
outlawed
â€“
would
those
be
otherwise
outlawed
by
the
state
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
by
native,
you
mean,
established
communities
like
these?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
just
an
indian?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
individual
indian
roaming
in
alaska?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
claim
of
the
government
was
not
--
was
the
operative
of
any
fishermen
who
happens
to
be
an
indian
has
protected
right.
i
understood
that
was
precisely
not
the
claim
that
was
disavowed,
but
you're
saying
that
if
indian
--
indian
means
--
an
individual
indian,
that
means
half
the
fishing
industry
and
that
means
half
the
fishing
industry
can
be
withdrawn
from
the
state
control?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
relation
of
an
indian
community
to
the
federal
government
is
a
very
different
thing
in
the
long
course
of
indian
history
--
an
indian
law
history,
than
the
relation
of
an
emancipated
individual
indian?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
but
we
are
talking
about
a
community
entity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
there's
nobody
knows,
as
you
know,
as
well
as
i
do,
that
that
was
better,
that
that
was
a
very
important
measure
in
the
evolution
of
indian
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
fully
follow
your
argument
and
i
think
i
appreciate
it.
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
the
basis
from
your
argument
in
drawing
the
difference
between
an
established
community
under
the
wheeler-howard
act
and
an
individual
indian?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
--
it
may?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
wipes
out
all
the
other
any
legal
differentiation
between
the
two
kinds
of
indian
associations
(a)
an
individual,
an
indian
lawyer
practicing
in
juneau
or
(b)
an
editor
who
happens
to
be
an
indian
and
these
organized
or
establish
communities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
you
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
bother
about
me,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
to
what
your
position
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
summarize
quickly
with
us,
concluding
on
the
general
stand,
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
present
range
of
authority
of
the
federal
government
for
the
exercise
through
the
secretary
of
the
interior
over
indians
in
alaska.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
--
not
fishing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
range,
the
scope
of
authority,
if
any,
over
indians?
does
that
include
an
individual
indian
who
practices
law
in
juneau
or
some
editor
or
does
it
relate
only
to
organized
communities,
organized
not
in
a
technical
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
--
how
about
the
non-tribal
collectivities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
about
if
these
are
the
organizers
of
wheeler-howard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
tribes,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
sandoval
case
this
court
said
that
the
federal
government,
secretary
of
interior
can
bring
together
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
and
call
it
an
indian
tribe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right,
but
would
--
would
this
control
be
over
the
individual
who
might
take
it
for
granted
the
individual
indian
lawyer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
lawyer
of
indian
extraction
in
juneau
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
these
subject
to
(inaudible)
control?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that,
of
course,
certainly
operates
on
some
changes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
one
must
make
a
general
decision
out
of
that.
i'm
not
saying
the
50
claims,
etcetera.
that's
a
generalize
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
indian
rights,
but
therefore
it
must
have
some
generalized
content.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
takes
more
than
two
â€“
it
does
two
specifics?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
though
those
subsistence
rights
may
cut
heavily
into
police
power
regulation
by
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
state
may
have
a
different
mode
of
dealing
with
those
subsistence
needs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
gross,
we've
been
recently
reading
a
good
deal
about
different
methods
of
relief.
evidently
--
evidently
created
a
very
serious
question.
alaska
may
have
a
social
stream
of
relief,
greatly
interfered
with
by
what
you
recognized
could
be
the
regulation
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
and
might
undercut
their
own
needs
program?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
all
depends
what
the
--
what
the
conflict
is
between
the
two
measures.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
this
--
i
gather,
i
know
nothing
about
it
except
what
you've
just
told
us,
but
this
claim
by
this
tribe,
what's
the
name
of
it,
tlingos?
justice
felix
frankfurter
tlingit
tribe,
is
like
the
claim
we've
had
before,
decided
on
this
court,
by
other
tribes
who
claimed
the
extinction
of
rights,
which
they
claim
for
compensable
rights
and
on
which
the
court
(inaudible)
divided,
it's
one
of
those
cases,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
tribal
claim
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
extinction
of
what
was
deemed
to
be
vested
or
at
least
compensable
property
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
court
has
--
divided
on
whether
you
make
out
such
a
case
or
not.
i
don't
quite
to
be
fair
enough
for
this
case.
