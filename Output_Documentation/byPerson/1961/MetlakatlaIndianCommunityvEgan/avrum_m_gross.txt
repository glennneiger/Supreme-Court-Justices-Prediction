mr.
avrum
m.
gross
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
early
in
the
appellant's
argument
that
the
real
question
here
is
the
interpretation
of
section
4
of
the
statehood
act
and
that
section
4
deprives
alaska
of
authority
to
regulate
any
indian
fishing
rights.
the
real
issue
for
this
court
today
is
whether
these
appellants
have
fishing
rights.
now,
i
don't
believe
this
court
can
decide
that
question
without
understanding
what
the
regulatory
scheme
in
alaska
was
prior
to
the
statehood
act
because
all
parties
to
this
litigation
are
agreed
that
no
rights
were
created
in
the
statehood
act,
only
rights
were
preserved.
so
the
question
is,
what
rights
that
indians
have
prior
to
statehood?
prior
to
1924,
regulation
of
the
alaska
commercial
fisheries
was
nearly
non-existent
although
the
power
did
exist
in
the
federal
government,
but
in
1924,
congress
adopted
the
white
act.
now,
the
white
act
perhaps
remains
a
model
for
most
state
conservation
programs
today.
under
that
act,
the
secretary
of
the
--
or
secretary
of
commerce
was
subsequently
transferred
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
authorized
to
do
several
things.
first
of
all,
he
was
authorized
to
set
up
areas
in
alaskan
waters
over
any
area
in
alaska,
over
which
the
united
states
had
jurisdiction
through
(inaudible).
it
sets
these
areas
of
any
waters
of
alaska.
now,
once
he
set
up
these
areas,
he
could
regulate
the
fishing
within
them.
by
that
i
mean
that
he
could
prescribe
methods,
means,
times
of
fishing,
seasons
of
fishing.
now,
under
the
white
act,
traps
were
allowed
in
alaska,
but
there's
been
confusion
raised
here
and
i
want
to
clear
it
up
as
quickly
as
possible.
the
appellants
say
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
authorized
them
to
use
fish
traps.
now
that
is
simply
not
true.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
passed
regulations
which
allowed
anyone
to
use
fish
traps
in
a
particular
area,
just
as
a
particular
any
other
type
of
equipment
was
authorized,
nets,
hook
and
line,
anything.
traps
were
one
of
the
types
of
equipment
which
were
authorized
to
be
used
in
a
particular
area
of
water.
no
particular
community
or
person
was
ever
authorized
to
use
traps
in
alaska.
i
think
that's
crucial
because
--
because
all
through
this
litigation,
i
think
the
impression
has
been
given
that
the
secretary
specifically
designated
this
community
to
use
traps,
he
did
not.
areas
were
permitted
and
these
individuals
used
traps
in
the
area.
now,
in
fact
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
exactly
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
in
fact,
the
records
show
that
the
very
traps
which
were
used
by
kake
and
angoon
in
this
litigation
were
actually
used
by
the
p.e.
harris
company
prior
to
1948
and
1950
in
the
exact
place
where
they
are
now
being
fished
today,
so
anyone
could
use
them.
now,
when
we
talk
about
a
native
fishery
in
alaska,
it's
actually
a
misnomer.
in
the
commercial
fisheries,
there
was
no
native
fishery.
the
white
act
made
no
distinctions
between
alaskans,
white
alaskans
and
native
alaskans.
this
is
quite
reasonable
if
the
court
will
--
will
think
fishing
is
perhaps
the
only
industry
of
alaska.
it
certainly
was
back
to
turn
of
the
century
except
for
gold
which
is
now
extremely
(inaudible),
but
it
was
--
would
have
been
impossible
for
people
to
come
to
the
territory
if
they
could
not
have
fished
on
at
least
an
equal
basis
with
the
natives
that
were
there.
now
in
this
litigation,
the
natives
aren't
only
claiming
the
right
to
fish
on
an
equal
basis
with
white
citizens
in
alaska,
they're
claiming
it
on
a
privilege
basis.
but
the
white
act
specifically
said
that
no
exclusive
right
of
fishery
shall
be
given
to
any
group
in
alaska.
and
this
court
held
in
hynes
against
grimes
that
that
specific
clause
applied
to
natives
as
well
as
anybody
else
that
no
rights
could
be
given
to
natives
under
the
white
act,
absolutely
none.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
your
honor,
i
--
i
will
answer
question
but
the
fully
discussion
of
this
will
be
undertaken
by
mr.
attorney
general
moody.
i
wish
to
restrict
myself
mainly
to
kake
and
angoon,
but
i
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
correct.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
right.
and
i
believe
that
the
1924
statement
in
the
white
act
which
says
that
no
citizen
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
fish
in
alaska,
in
any
area
where
fishing
is
permitted
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
which
is
the
last
sentence
of
section
1,
may
have
will
abolish
the
metlakatla
water
reservation.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
hold
that,
to
uphold
alaska's
right
to
regulate
the
metlakatla
reservation.
but
i
--
and
i
do
raise
the
point
that
congress
may
well
have
meant
to
exclude
the
metlakatla
reservation
which
had
--
it
had
specifically
set
up,
but
you
do
raise
the
point
which
may
well
be
valid
and
it
may
well
indeed
have
abolished
the
water
reservation,
the
specific
declaration
of
equal
rights
to
all
fishermen
in
all
waters
of
alaska.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
this
is
debated
between
justice
rutledge
in
hynes
against
grimes
packing
company,
seem
to
view
that
the
legislative
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
white
act
did
imply
that
congress
meant
to
exclude
the
white
act
from
applications
to
validly
created
indian
reservations.
now,
the
court,
the
majority
of
the
court
at
that
time
disagreed.
it
did
say
and
i
think
the
hynes
case
is
extremely
important
here,
because
--
and
perhaps
i
can
answer
your
question
best
by
reviewing
the
two
holdings
of
the
cases
that
have
been
pointed
out
here.
hynes
said
first
of
all
that
the
secretary
for
the
president
could
reserve
areas
in
alaska
for
exclusive
rights
of
fishing
under
the
wheeler-howard
act,
which
was
a
later
passed
act
than
the
white
act.
it
also
said
that
the
white
act
could
not
be
used
to
protect
those
areas
and
it
also
held
that
the
white
act
could
apply
to
those
areas.
now,
a
number
of
things
i
think
are
important.
first
of
all,
assuming
that
the
area
thereby
set
aside
in
the
hynes
case
became
and
exclusive
right,
it
only
became
exclusive
as
to
area.
the
secretary
was
given
full
authority
to
regulate
the
means
of
fishing
within
the
area.
now,
so
you
have
this
distinction,
the
areas
retained
but
the
regulation
is
not.
now
in
metlaktla,
metlakatla
was
established
before
the
white
act
was
passed.
now,
it
may
--
here,
you
get
little
interplay
of
two
reservations
created
and
an
act
between
them.
the
act
may
well
have
cut
off
the
first
and
yet,
it's
superseded
by
the
second,
but
in
any
case
the
regulation
--
the
regu
--
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
white
act
extends
to
those
reservations,
the
regulation
of
the
fishing
within
the
reservations.
this,
the
hynes
case
did
hold
that
the
area
could
be
set
aside,
but
the
means
of
fishing
within
it
was
subject
to
general
regulatory
authority.
there
was
never
any
right
to
be
free
of
general
regulatory
authority
in
any
reservation
in
alaska.
now,
this
then
was
the
status
of
fishing
prior
to
the
statehood
act
and
the
statehood
act
reserved
for
state
control,
all
indian
fishing
rights.
now
first
of
all,
i
want
to
make
absolutely
clear
the
position
of
the
statehood.
we
will
concede
for
argument
that
if
congress
had
wished
to,
it
could
have
reserved
the
control
of
all
indian
fishing
to
the
federal
government.
the
effect
might
well
had
been
disastrous
in
alaska,
but
it
might
well
have
done
so,
but
congress
didn't.
congress
only
reserved
indian
fishing
rights.
those
are
the
words
of
the
statute.
it
could
have
used
the
fishing
but
it
did
not.
so
then
the
question
becomes,
looking
back
into
alaskan
history
by
the
--
by
the
test
laid
down
by
this
court
as
to
what
constitutes
indian
rights,
whether
indians
really
had
rights
in
alaska.
well,
this
court
has
already
heard
from
the
appellants
in
this
case,
and
i
refer
now
to
kake
and
angoon
that
there
is
no
treaty
between
the
indians
of
kake
and
angoon
and
the
federal
government.
it
has
also
heard
taken
angoon
state
that
there
is
no
reservation
in
kake.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
correct.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
correct.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
if
they
do
have
indian
fishing
rights
as
defined
by
this
court
then
the
state
of
alaska
would
not
have
the
power
to
regulate.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
sir!
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
well,
section
--
but
what
i
--
what
i
wish
to
make
clear
mr.
justice
whittaker
is
that
rights
have
a
--
have
a
defined
meaning
in
alaska
and
have
defined
meaning
under
--
under
the
terms,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
term
was
not
used
in
advisably.
so
i
mean
it's
not
a
new
concept
of
right.
now,
there
are
no
treaties
and
there
are
no
reservations
for
the
kake
and
angoon
indians.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
that
--
that
there
are
two
basic
kinds
of
indian
title
recognized
and
unrecognized
indian
title.
as
there
are
no
reservations
and
no
treaties,
and
no
statute
creating
rights
for
kake
and
angoon
specifically,
we
don't
have
recognized
rights
and
kake
and
angoon
freely
admit
this.
so
the
question
is
where
they
have
unrecognized
rights
and
those
would
be
of
course
rights
protected
against
third
parties,
in
this
case
the
state
of
alaska
being
the
third
party.
now
recognized,
unrecognized
rights
could
be
broken
down
in
two
categories
again.
those
rights
which
are
preserved
or
aboriginal
rights,
historical
indian
title
it's
called
or
those
rights
which
are
created
by
statute,
a
temporary
right
which
does
not
create
compensation,
a
right
to
compensation
upon
termination,
but
which
is
nonetheless
a
right
against
third
parties.
now,
we
are
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
aboriginal
title
is
normally
a
question
of
fact,
but
we
contend
to
this
court
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
these
indians
has
no
aboriginal
title
and
cannot
have
aboriginal
title.
now,
in
buttressing
this
claim,
i
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
last
two
sentences
of
section
1
of
the
white
act.
you
will
find
that
printed
in
full
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix
on
page
53
and
54
sentences
that
we
are
particularly
interested
in.
now,
first
of
all,
the
secretary
was
empowered
to
regulate
fisheries
all
through
alaska
and
it
said
that
when
the
secretary
did
regulate
fisheries,
his
regulations
could
not
be
made
exclusive.
they
must
apply
to
all
equally.
now,
this
court
recognized
in
hynes
that
it
could
not
be
exclusive
as
to
natives
too.
it
is
specifically
applied
to
native
as
well
as
others.
so
in
short,
this
part,
this
sentence
is
exclusive
--
no
exclusive
right
forbade
the
secretary
of
the
interior
through
his
regulations
to
protect
any
aboriginal
rights
which
existed.
he
had
through
his
regulations,
to
open
up
any
area
in
alaska,
if
it
was
opened
up
to
natives,
it
had
to
be
opened
up
to
whites
as
well.
so
he
could
not
protect
aboriginal
claim,
any
exclusive
right
of
possession
of
natives.
he
could
not
protect
it
with
that,
but
the
next
sentence,
the
next
sentence
of
the
white
act
is
most
crucial.
there
it
says
that
no
citizens
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
fish
in
any
area
of
water
in
alaska
where
--
where
fishing
is
permitted.
now,
here
is
the
clearest
and
most
unequivocal
statement
that
could
made
that
no
person
shall
have
an
exclusive
right
in
waters
of
alaska,
that
whether
he
be
native
or
white
or
corporation
or
individual.
he
has
no
exclusive
right.
if
he
had
one,
it
is
now
gone.
everyone
can
fish
there
and
everyone
did
fish
there.
i
wish
--
i
can't
make
this
too
strong
for
the
court.
these
very
natives,
kake
and
angoon
purchased
their
sites,
purchased
their
cannery
from
a
private
company
which
was
fishing
in
the
very
area
they
now
--
now
claim.
all
through
alaska,
canneries
are
set
up
on
the
biggest
salmon
streams
quite
obviously
and
these
are
very
areas
where
these
native
tribes
or
native
people
fished
in
past
years.
again
quite
obviously,
people
clustered
where
the
fish
were.
now,
in
regard
to
whether
aboriginal
rights
exists
such
as
kake
and
angoon
claim,
i
should
like
to
make
reference
to
the
solicitor
general's
opinion
which
kake
and
angoon
cite
in
their
brief
as
holding,
that
no
--
that
aboriginal
fishing
rights
do
exist
in
alaska.
i
should
like
to
take
--
to
take
this
into
consideration
in
conjunction
with
the
claim
in
the
metlakatla
brief
which
we
agree,
with
which
we
agree
that
this
solicitor's
opinion
should
be
given
some
weight
in
this
case.
we
recognized
this,
his
interpretation
of
what
the
white
act
meant
for
instance.
well,
first
of
all,
the
solicitor's
opinion
held
that
aboriginal
fishing
rights
do
exist
in
alaska
in
spite
of
the
white
act,
but
certain
things
are
curious.
first
of
all,
from
1924
to
1942,
no
action
was
ever
taken
by
the
solicitor
to
enforce
these
aboriginal
rights.
in
1942,
he
gave
his
opinion.
the
1942
to
1959
again,
exactly
nothing
was
ever
done
to
claim
aboriginal
rights
except
one
thing,
a
bill
was
introduced
by
the
solicitor
in
congress
which
would
have
protected
what
the
solicitor
considered
aboriginal
--
department
of
interior
considered
aboriginal
rights
and
that
bill
was
rejected,
and
you
will
find
that
in
the
kake
and
angoon
brief.
but
most
important
is
the
opinion
of
the
solicitor
on
why
he
thought
there
were
aboriginal
rights
in
alaska.
he
considered
the
last
sentence
of
the
white
act,
the
one
i
have
already
discussed
with
this
court
regarding
the
exclusive
that
--
that
every
citizen
must
be
allowed
to
fish
in
an
area
where
any
fishing
is
permitted
and
he
said,
“it's
true.
this
sentence
certainly
does
look
like
it
extinguishes
aboriginal
rights.”
but
he
said
and
the
court
must
remember
that
this
was
1942
and
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
tee-hit-ton
case,
“but”
the
solicitor
said,
“that
taking
by
congress
of
aboriginal
title
is
forbidden
under
the
fifth
amendment,
and
therefore
we
cannot
read
this
act
as
unconstitutional
interpretation.”
therefore,
the
solicitor
avoided
that
interpretation.
this
court
of
course
subsequently
in
1954
i
believe
it
was
in
the
tee-hit-ton
case
held
specifically
the
opposite,
that
it
was
not
indeed
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
terminate
aboriginal
title
in
anyway
saw
fit,
without
any
liability
arising
whatsoever
unless
congress
saw
fit
to
give
that
liability.
so
i
merely
point
this
out
to
show
two
things.
first,
the
opinion
of
the
department
of
the
interior
as
expressed
through
its
actions
in
alaska
has
consistently
been
that
no
aboriginal
title
exists
and
second
that
even
in
his
written
opinion,
the
solicitor
recognized
that
there
was
no
aboriginal
title
in
alaska
and
would
have
held
so
except
for
the
fact
that
he
believed
this
interpretation
would
have
been
unconstitutional,
and
that
assumption
has
been
proven
incorrect
by
this
court.
now
so
much
for
aboriginal
title,
there
also
remains
the
question
as
to
whether
any
other
kinds
of
rights
were
created
for
these
indians
unrecognized
rights,
but
rights
nonetheless.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes
i
am,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
but
if
any
of
the
justices
wished
to
question
me
on
any
relation
between
the
two,
of
course
i'm
prepared
to
answer
on
them.
now,
so
much
for
aboriginal
title,
but
we
still
recognize
that
congress
could
create
through
statutes
right
--
rights
in
these
natives
and
if
they
did
so,
even
though
those
rights
were
unrecognized,
they
were
preserved
by
the
statehood
act.
we
fully
concede
this
point.
the
question
is,
was
the
right
to
use
traps,
was
it
a
right?
now,
the
only
act
under
which
fishing
in
alaska
was
conducted
was
the
white
act.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
well,
when
i
say
property,
special
individual
property
right,
i
do
not
mean
by
this
that
it
must
be
recognized
as
against
the
government
and
therefore
compensable
upon
on
taking.
when
i
say
a
right
or
a
property
right,
i
simply
mean
a
claim
against
any
one,
meaning
a
third
party,
an
individual
or
the
state
or
the
federal
government,
anyone.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
a
public
right
of
fishery
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
--
and
this
act
specifically
speaks
of
native
rights
and
this
is
not
--
this
is
a
very
different
thing
in
the
public
right
of
fishery
i
believe.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
correct.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
correct.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
believe
that
is
correct.
i
believe
that
is
--
that
is
very
correct,
but
i
am
--
i
am
now
trying
to
adjust
--
this
goes
a
trifle
further
than
our
argument.
this
gives
an
even
more
restricted
view
i
think
and
i
am
trying
to
recognize
that
any
kind
of
fishing
right,
even
unconnected
to
property
was
not
preserved
to
these
natives,
but
the
fishing
right
by
the
way
that
you
are
speaking
of,
i
point
this
out
mr.
justice
whittaker,
a
fishing
right
connected
to
property.
this
is
the
very
issue
which
was
just
taken
off
in
the
court
of
claims
in
which
these
very
indians
have
sued
and
--
and
received
a
judgment
that
there
is
a
liability
against
the
government
for
a
taking
of
fishing
rights
connected
to
land.
they
did
so.
this
–
they
got
the
claim
for
the
entire
portion
of
southeastern
alaska
which
they
now
claim.
the
traps
which
are
in
this
case
are
in
that
area,
these
very
indians
have
just
received
a
claim
for
compensation
for
this
that
the
lands
were
taken
and
the
court
of
claims
based
this
decision
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
just
i
was
getting
to
justice
black,
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
active
taking
in
this
case,
they
did
not
go
up
to
the
white
act.
they
took
historical
acts
and
got
as
far
as
i
think
it
was
190
--
it's
in
--
before
1920
i
believe
in
which
congress
reserved
from
the
public
domain
the
tongass
natural
forest
in
southeastern
alaska
which
comprises
all
the
land
which
is
involved
here
and
even
more
and
the
court
of
claims
felt
that
this
reservation
was
inconsistent
with
the
indians'
exclusive
right
of
possession
and
they
further
pointed
out
that
the
indians
had
lost
their
fishing
rights
connected
to
the
land,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
in
fact
the
compensation
in
that
case
according
to
the
court
of
claims
will
be
granted
as
of
the
date
the
land
was
taken
because
the
court
assumed
in
that
case
as
i
think
you
do
now
that
these
fishing
rights
were
nothing
more
than
easements
connected
to
the
land.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
right.
and
the
date
that
the
land
was
taken,
these
fishing
rights
were
taken.
this
is
the
court
of
claims
viewpoint.
and
i
believe
that
perhaps
that
one
of
the
reasons
the
court
of
claims
didn't
reach,
didn't
go
to
white
act
to
destroy
these
fishing
rights
which
i
think
the
white
act
clearly
did,
was
because
by
1924,
the
value
of
these
fisheries
are
astronomical
and
--
and
it's
going
to
be
astronomical
enough
at
the
date
of
taking
of
the
tongass
natural
forest.
but
i
think
the
court
of
claims
was
quite
satisfied
and
happy
with
terminating
these
rights
at
the
earliest
date
possible,
if
there
were
alternative
basis
and
i
think
they
saw
it
--
they
do
not
mention
the
white
act
but
they
do
not
need
to
because
they
have
terminated
the
rights
before
the
white
act
has
ever
even
passed.
now
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no
--
no
that
is
not
my
distinction,
mr.
justice.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i'd
be
happy
to
tell
the
court.
first
of
all
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
want
a
one
thing
clear,
we
do
not
argue
here
that
metlaktla
was
abolished
by
the
white
act.
it
may
have
been,
and
i
grant
this,
but
we
do
not
view
that
it
is
necessary
to
our
case.
one
thing
is
quite
clear,
karluk
in
the
hynes
case
for
instance
was
not
abolished
for
simple
reason
it
was
created
after
the
white
act,
that
much
we
know,
but
let
me
list
for
the
court
some
fishing
rights
that
there
are
in
alaskan
perhaps
it
can
understand
the
difference
then
between
what
we
are
talking
about
here
and
what
legitimate
fishing
rights
are.
there
are
statutes
in
alaska
out
of
the
federal
statutes
--
excuse
me
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
which
forbid
any
citizen
of
alaska
as
well
as
any
where
else
to
take
fur
seals.
this
is
a
seal
fishery
by
the
way
and
that's
the
proper
terminology.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
fur
seals,
that's
correct,
but
the
natives,
living
along
the
coast
of
alaska
are
permitted
this
right
for
subsistence.
they
are
--
they
are
the
only
ones
allowed
to
take
the
seals.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
by
an
expressed
statutory
provision
(voice
overlap)
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
1944
i
believe
justice
frankfurter.
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
well,
i
do
not
think
if
you
consider
seals
a
commercial
fishery,
since
white
act
was
directed
for
the
regulation
of
the
commercial
fishery
and
seals
have
never
been
considered
in
that
same
manner.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
don't
think
so
because
where
seals
fishery,
the
white
act
was
directed
at
the
salmon
fishery
in
alaska,
if
you
look
at
the
commercial
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no
it
said
the
commercial
fisheries
of
alaska
but
seals
are
not
a
commercial
fishery
of
alaska
because
they
were
banned.
they
were
--
the
treaty
which
stopped
all
fishing
from
seals
antedated
the
white
act.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
correct.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
correct.
now,
also
we
have
the
karluk
reservation
set
up
and
which
in
hynes
--
in
hynes
against
grimes
packing
company
was
upheld,
an
exclusive
right
of
fishery,
an
area
of
water
in
which
no
other
alaskan
can
fish
but
natives,
this
is
all.
now
this
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes
it
was.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
a
monopoly
was
granted
to
the
natives
as
to
the
area
of
fishery;
that
is
right.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
the
act
under
which
the
karluk
reserve
was
set
up
was
passed
in
1936,
12
years
after
the
white
act.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes,
there
was.
well
it
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
in
what
--
in
what
case?
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
think
section
4
in
effect
mr.
justice
frankfurter
literally
repeals
the
white
act
as
applied
to
alaska
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
protection
of
the
indian
fishing
rights.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
right.
and
if
they
were
fishing
rights,
the
white
act
is
still
operative
as
to
those
fishing
rights.
that
is
correct,
but
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
recess,
i
was
trying
to
indicate
to
this
court
the
nature
of
some
genuine
native
rights
in
alaska,
which
were
truly
rights
and
to
compare
them
with
the
rights
in
quotes
which
are
claimed
in
this
case.
now
first,
i
pointed
out
that
the
seal
fishery
was
specially
set
up
by
statute
and
natives
had
a
--
an
exclusive
right
to
take
seals
for
subsistent.
no
other
person
was
allowed
this
right.
now
secondly,
there
is
the
karluk
reservation
which
this
court
sustained
in
hynes
against
grimes
packing
company.
now,
it
sustained
it
as
to
which
exclusiveness
that
no
other
alaskan
or
anyone
else
could
fish
within
the
confines
of
the
karluk
reservation.
now
thirdly,
the
white
act
only
pertained
to
commercial
fishing.
now,
it
did
not
affect
subsistence
fishing.
now,
along
the
yukon
and
kuskokwim
rivers
in
alaska,
they
have
always
--
the
natives
of
that
area
have
always
fished
for
king
salmon
on
the
subsistence
basis
and
in
doing
so,
they
have
used
small
hand
traps
and
fish
wheels
and
if
the
court
will
note
chapter
17
as
amended
of
the
alaska
session
laws,
which
is
the
statute
in
issue
in
this
case,
you
will
see
that
it
excludes
hand-driven
fish
traps
and
fish
wheels,
which
is
the
means
of
subsistence
fishing
along
those
rivers
in
alaska.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
a
fish
wheel,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
a
--
is
a
wheel
which
is
turned
by
the
current,
much
as
a
windmill
would
be
turned
by
the
wind
and
salmon
are
not
very
intelligent.
they
come
into
the
wheel
and
the
wheel
just
literally
picks
them
right
up,
carries
them
around
and
dumps
them
into
a
trawl.
they
slide
down
the
trawl
into
a
box
where
they're
kept
until
the
native
takes
them
out.
it's
an
aboriginal
means
of
fishing.
it's
hundreds
of
years
old,
or
as,
i
might
point
out
that
the
fish
traps
in
this
case
are
extremely
recent
developments.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
fish
wheels
or
fish
traps,
your
honor?
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
oh,
fish
wheels,
maybe
--
oh,
they
may
extend
for
10
or
15
feet
above
the
water.
it's
difficult
to
say
because
there
are
pipes
leading
various
ways.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
not
in
comparison
with
the
fish
trap?
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no,
and
their
--
their
--
the
effect
on
the
salmon
runs
is
almost
negligible
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
--
but
they
take
very
few.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
now,
i
want
to
stress
to
the
court
where
these
rights
i
have
--
there
only
three
or
four
rights
that
i've
told
this
court
about,
but,
i
don't
want
to
minimize
their
importance.
these
are
tremendously
important
fishing
rights.
let
me
show
why.
the
karluk
river
reservation
gives
the
natives
of
karluk
an
exclusive
right
to
fish
the
area
around
the
karluk
river.
now,
this
court
will
recall
in
hynes
and
grimes
packing
company,
it
recognized
that
the
karluk
river
fishery
was
perhaps
the
most
important
fishery
in
that
area
of
alaska.
it's
an
enormous
fishery.
they
--
they
take
millions
of
red
salmon
that
come
up
the
karluk
river
each
year.
now
--
and
don't
--
this
right
cannot
be
minimized.
it's
very
important.
as
far
as
subsistence
or
the
kuskokwim
is
concerned,
this
may
not
be
terribly
important
to
the
fish
runs,
but
it's
terribly
important
to
the
natives
on
the
kuskokwim.
this
is
their
way
of
life.
they
eat
this
fish.
these
are
subsistence.
they're
not
using
them
to
make
money
with.
they
--
they're
using
to
feed
their
wives
and
children
and
to
them,
it's
an
important
right.
there's
no
question
about
that
and
these
are
aboriginal
natives.
these
are
people
that
have
not
developed
in
the
interior
of
alaska.
these
are
the
backward
tribes.
we
are
not
talking
about
that
kind
of
a
tribe
in
this
case,
right.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
not
literally
millions,
your
honor.
i
would
guess
the
--
the
number
is
closer.
i'm
not
into
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
on
the
karluk
river
commercial
fishery,
your
honor.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
it
--
that
was
upheld
in
hynes
against
grimes.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
now,
in
these
cases,
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
we
have
a
statute
or
a
practice
which
has
distinguished
natives
from
the
rest
of
the
population.
in
fact,
i
might
use
the
solicitor
general's
words.
these
indians
are
fishing
as
indians,
not
as
citizens.
they
are
fishing
as
indians.
this
is
something
connected
to
their
specific
status
as
indian,
but
under
the
white
act,
under
the
white
act
now
which
is
talking
about
the
commercial
fisheries
in
alaska,
under
that
act,
indians
fished
as
equals
with
everyone.
they're
not
only
were
treated
equally,
they
were
treated
in
common.
there
was
no
distinction
made
in
any
regulation
between
indians
and
non-indians.
they
were
just
speaking
of
citizens
and
indians
were
citizens.
everyone
was
treated
exactly
the
same.
now,
the
question
then
comes
up,
and
this
is
specific,
whether
the
use
of
a
fish
trap
under
the
white
act
created
any
kind
of
a
right
whatsoever.
now,
for
one
thing
we're
talking
about
common
treatment.
everyone
is
using
--
everyone
has
the
same
power
to
use
a
fish
trap
because
the
regulation
permits
it
in
a
certain
area.
anyone
can
move
into
that
area
and
set
up
a
fish
trap.
so,
once
this
is
done,
did
it
create
a
right?
and
this
court
doesn't
have
to
be
in
the
dark
on
this
question
because
there
are
federal
cases
in
alaska.
they
hold
series
of
federal
cases,
which
you
will
find
cited
at
page
21
of
our
brief,
which
spec
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
exactly
correct.
as
the
solicitor
general
would
say,
“we
are
speaking
of
their
indian
right
as
indians”.
this
is
a
very
different
thing
than
the
general
public
right
of
fishery
which
is
normally
spoken
of
in
abstract
terms.
we
are
speaking
of
an
individual
or
a
community
for
that
matter,
right
against
any
other
party
or
against
the
government
itself.
and
--
and
the
cases
in
alaska
cited
at
page
21
of
our
brief,
federal
cases
in
alaska
have
an
equivocally
held
that
the
use
of
a
trap
under
the
white
act
created
rights
against
no
one,
absolutely
no
one.
it
could
be
appropriated
by
third
parties.
third
parties
could
come
in
and
set-up
a
trap
right
next
door.
it
could
be
--
it
couldn't
be
enforced
against
the
government.
the
government
could
stop
to
use
of
traps
in
the
area
in
the
moment
and
did
often
times.
now,
with
these
decisions
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
exactly,
exactly.
the
--
these
traps
were
regulated
not
by
individuals
but
by
areas
and
the
--
just
like
--
it
would
speci
--
you
will
see
in
our
--
our
brief
--
by
the
way
mr.
justice
whittaker,
on
page
19
and
20,
a
typical
regulation
under
which
traps
were
allowed.
now,
i
picked
this
regulation
because
it
is
the
regulation
under
which
the
kake
and
angoon
traps
were
fished
and
you'll
see
that
it
opens
areas
to
trap
fishing
and
defines
them
by
degrees
of
longitude
--
latitude.
now,
in
this
area,
anyone
could
use
a
fish
trap,
absolutely
anyone.
just
like
--
the
only
--
the
only
limitation
was
areas
--
physical
limitations.
two
nets
can't
fish
in
the
same
water
at
the
same
time.
there
is
just
isn't
enough
room
and
the
same
thing
goes
for
traps.
there
has
to
be
a
--
a
distance
between
traps.
there
always
was
a
distance
between
traps
in
alaska,
but
it
could
be
anyone,
anyone
could
fish
the
traps.
it's
just
a
particular
form
of
fishing
gear
like
anything
else
as
a
particular
form
of
fishing
gear.
now,
along
with
the
fact
that
the
white
act
treated
these
natives,
that
we're
talking
about
here
as
completely
equal
citizens
in
every
regard
and
gave
them
no
native
rights
in
the
commercial
fishery,
i
wish
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
this
was
entirely
consistent
with
the
entire
congressional
policy
all
through
alaska.
natives
were
not
segregated
from
the
rest
to
the
population.
we
had
no
treaties
in
the
alaska,
none
whatsoever.
we
had,
except
for
the
metlakatla
in
karluk,
no
reservations
in
alaska
whatsoever
and
these
are
limited
reservations
as
--
as
this
court
will
see
from
--
from
observing
the
statutes
under
which
they
were
established.
now,
indians
in
alaska
have
always
paid
all
taxes
in
alaska,
always.
they've
no
distinction
between
them
and
other
citizen.
they've
always
been
tried
by
territorial
which
were,
in
those
cases,
federal
courts,
along
under
territorial
law.
they
never
had
a
tribal
law
under
which
these
indians
were
--
were
tried,
always
the
same
--
tried
in
the
same
manner.
they
have
always
been
completely
full
citizens.
there
has
been
no
distinction
made
between
them
and
the
rest
to
the
citizens
in
alaska
and
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
but
i
want
reiterate
to
this
court
how
completely
amalgamated
the
natives
are
in
alaska.
now,
for
instance,
natives
vote.
now,
you've
heard
--
you've
heard
the
estimate
here
of
how
many
natives
there
are
in
the
--
in
the
state.
that's
approximately,
i
believe,
12%
or
something
to
that
effect.
now,
the
alaska
legislature,
on
the
other
hand,
is
composed
15%
of
natives.
so
i
think
quite
obviously
that
these
natives
are
not
only
drawing
there
support
from
there
native
brethren,
they're
being
elected
by
whites.
the
president
of
the
senate
in
alaska
is
a
tlingit
indian,
who
was
elected
from
an
election
district
nearly
80%
white.
these
are
indians
which
are
completely
integrated
into
the
society.
we
have
been
very
fortunate
in
alaska.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
all
of
them.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
everyone.
in
--
this
court
recognized
years
ago
in
the
kagama
case
when
it
was
upholding
a
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
they
do
not.
the
bia,
i
--
i
should
say,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
does
run
rural
schools
in
indian
communities
where
whites
may
not
live
and
in
that
sense,
there
are
--
it
is
segregated
in
fact,
but
all
states
schools
are
open
for
indian
and
non-indian
alike
and
the
schools
in
metlakatla,
kake,
and
angoon
are
states
schools,
all
of
them.
now,
in
the
kagama
case,
this
court
recognized
in
upholding
the
federal
power,
that
the
reason,
one
of
the
reasons
is,
it
was
so
important
to
uphold
federal
power
was,
and
i
--
i
think
use
almost
the
court's
identical
words,
the
citizens
of
the
state,
their
neighbors
in
the
state
are
often
they
worst
enemies.
there's
a
real
problem.
there
was
friction
between
indians
and
other
citizens
in
the
state.
we've
been
very
fortunate
in
alaska,
we
don't
have
that.
indians
and
white
are
equal
in
alaska,
as
indeed,
they
must
be
if
the
state
is
going
to
grow.
we
can't
afford
to
segregate
people
all.
we
need
every
citizen
we
have
to
develop
the
state.
now,
there
is
--
i
--
you
may
not
take
my
word
for
this.
there
is
a
number
of
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
federal
court
cases
which
have
recognized
consistently
the
complete
amalgamation
of
the
natives
in
southeastern
alaska
into
the
white
population.
certainly,
they
live
in
towns
which
are
--
these
various
communities
kake
and
angoon.
they
lived
in
the
towns
of
kake
and
angoon.
those
aren't
all
native
villages.
there
are
whites
living
in
kake
and
angoon.
these
are
element
--
these
are
--
these
are
alaska
cities.
they
are
incorporated
under
municipal
law
--
under
state
law
and
they
exercise
municipal
powers.
these
are
just
typical
cities
in
which
inhabitants
are
native.
this
is
--
this
is
race
were
talking
about
here.
now
--
now
that
the
--
i
want
to
point
out
--
i
point
out
as
not
to
claim
that
--
that
the
federal
government
has
lost
its
jurisdiction
over
natives
in
alaska
as
the
--
as
the
federal
government
itself
points
out
in
its
brief,
we
do
not
wish
to
confuse
the
existence
of
a
power
with
its
exercise.
we
recognized
that
natives
in
alaska
may
well
be
subject
to
federal
control.
we
don't
con
--
we
don't
contend
that
they
are
not.
what
we
do
contend
is
that
the
federal
government
has
never
sought
in
the
past
to
distinguish
these
races
and
especially
not
in
alaska's
largest
industry
and
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
past
federal
policy
to
hold
that
section
4
did
so
now,
that
where
the
federal
government
made
distinctions
in
the
past
for
subsistence
or
for
a
seal
fishery
or
a
specific
reservation,
that
makes
sense.
that
makes
sense
for
the
federal
government
to
continue
this,
but
it
is
entirely
inconsistent
with
past
federal
policy
to
suddenly
take
one-half
of
an
entire
industry,
segregate
them
on
the
basis
of
race
where
they
never
had
any
legal
rights
and
say,
“these
indians
are
now
different
from
the
rest
of
the
citizen.”
they
are
not
subject
to
state
regulation.
they
are
subject
to
federal
regulation
exclusively.
it
just
--
it
--
it's
just
completely
inconsistent
with
the
whole
history
of
federal
--
federal
policy
in
alaska.
what
--
what
that
section
means,
as
--
as
we
see
it,
is
that
where
congress
made
distinctions,
those
distinctions
were
preserved,
and
they
are
important
distinctions,
but
they
did
not
make
distinctions
all
through
the
commercial
fisheries
and
not
in
relation
to
traps
and
those
distinctions
that
never
existed
should
not
and
were
not
created
by
section
4,
that
is
essentially
our
argument
on
that
point.
now,
as
a
last
argument
regarding
the
interpretation
of
section
4,
we
wish
to
point
out
the
effect
that
the
various
interpretations
posed
here
today
will
have.
now,
i
do
not
say
this
because
i
want
this
court
to
pass
on
the
wisdom
of
an
act
of
congress.
obviously,
it
cannot
do
that,
but
we
do
want
to
point
out
that
the
interpretations
urged
here
today
will
result
in
an
absurd
conclusion
and
it
is
a
settled
point
of
statutory
construction
that
the
court
will
not
attempt
to
make
an
act
of
congress
into
an
absurd
--
give
it
an
absurd
construction.
now,
i
want
--
i
want
to
point
out
these
various
--
these
various
interpretations
suggested
and
show
to
court
what
will
happen
under.
now,
let
me
first
take
the
government's
view.
now,
the
government
really
has,
it
seems,
two
views.
the
view
in
their
brief
was
that
--
that
the
department
of
the
interior
has
full
authority
over
indian
fishing
to
do
with
as
it
sees
fit.
it
can
authorize
traps
or
not
authorize
traps.
it
can
authorize
11
traps
or
it
can
authorize
111
traps
if
it
wants
to
and
i
quote
from
the
governments
brief,
“the
secretary
has
full
authority
to
do
what
he
considers
proper
for
the
protection
of
the
indian
fishing
rights
including
enlargement
of
fishing
rights
beyond
those
now
enjoyed
subject
to
his
consideration
of
other
pertinent
factors
including
--
including
conservation.”
this
was
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
exactly.
but
the
government
in
its
brief,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
said
that
it
could
expand
these
rights.
this
is
what
i
was
getting
at.
if
--
if
the
government
is
correct
in
its
interpretation
and
--
and
we
are
talking
about
traps,
it
could
theoretically
authorize
111
traps
or
1111
traps.
the
fact
we
have
11
traps
now
is
of
no
effect
under
the
government's
interpretation.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
not
what
the
government's
brief
says.
that
is
what
kake
and
angoon
have
argued
here
today,
aboriginal
area.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
what
the
government
said
today
in
its
oral
argument,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
absolutely
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
frankfurter,
and
it's
quite
clear
that
that
justice
department
and
the
department
of
the
interior
vary
on
their
interpretations
on
this
act.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
not
under
the
government's
brief
construction,
mr.
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
it's
in
--
it's
--
in
their
brief,
they
make
it
unlimited.
before
the
court,
they
have
limited
it
to
the
21
sites,
that's
true.
i
merely
pointing
out
that
there's
two
interpretations
the
government
has
urged
and
i
want
to
discuss
both
of
them
to
show
the
court
what
will
happen,
but
before
i
do,
i
want
to
make
the
court
aware
of
one
thing.
under
the
white
act,
as
i
pointed
out,
there
were
regulations
authorizing
areas
for
traps.
now,
these
regulations
occupied
no
special
status
under
the
white
act.
they
had
no
more
legal
affect
than
a
regulation
permitting
next
in
a
particular
area
or
a
regulation
closing
an
area
to
fishing,
or
a
regulation
forbidding
a
particular
stream
from
being
fished
in
a
particular
manner.
in
short,
there
is
no
legal
difference
between
the
use
of
fish
traps
and
the
use
of
any
other
equipment
under
the
white
act,
now
i'm
speaking
of,
or
any
other
regulation
promulgated
under
the
white
act.
if
fish
traps
are
a
right
protected
by
section
4,
all
control
of
indian
fishing
was
con
--
was
protected
under
section
4.
i
cannot
urge
this
too
strongly,
but
the
fish
traps
are
no
special
device.
they
are
just
like
any
other
thing
that
was
used
under
the
white
act.
this
controversy
has
arisen
over
fish
traps
and
perhaps,
it's
--
it's
ironic
that
it
has
because,
the
fish
traps,
of
course,
have
been,
as
i've
been
pointed
out
for
various
reasons,
go
in
the
alaskan
throat,
not
only
in
the
white
alaskan's
throat,
as
you
will
see
in
our
brief,
the
natives
have
constantly
opposed
fish
traps
in
alaska,
too,
through
their
authorized
spokesman.
alaskans
dislike
traps
intensely
and
i
--
i'm
not
going
to
go
in
the
--
the
conservation
aspects
of
this.
the
statute
recites
it's
a
conservation
measure.
there
is
evidence
to
--
to
indicate
that
it
is
and
no
evidence
except
an
opinion
to
indicate
that
that
is
not
--
it's
not
on
us
to
prove
the
conservation
measure
on
--
of
the
statute,
it's
for
them
to
disprove
it,
and
there
is
no
evidence
on
that
of
any
kind.
but,
of
course,
as
to
the
legal
relevance
of
this
matter,
according
to
the
claims
made
here
today
whether
it's
a
conservation
measure
or
not,
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
difference
if
it
was
preserved
under
the
federal
government
the
state
has
no
power
to
regulate
it
in
any
case.
so
i
--
i
may
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
if
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
exactly
correct.
that's
true.
now,
so
let
me
--
let
me
consider
this
question
of
the
results
of
the
interpretations
that
have
been
suggested
today
on
the
basis
that
we're
not
only
talking
about
traps,
we're
talking
about
all
regulations
promulgated
under
the
white
act
because
there's
no
distinction
between
them.
now,
let
me
take
an
example
of
first,
the
broadest
interpretation,
which
has
been
suggested
today
that
the
gover
--
if
that's
in
the
government's
brief,
if
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
authority
over
all
natives
fishing
in
alaska
and
can
do
what
it
considers
proper
for
them,
well,
then
you
have
one
sovereign
state
regulating
the
white
fishermen
and
you
have
the
other
sovereign,
the
government
regulating
the
native
fishermen.
now,
this
can
be
disastrous
in
a
situation
and
i'll
give
you
a
perfect
example
of
it.
in
bristol
bay,
alaska,
which
is
the
largest
salmon
fishery
in
the
world,
millions
of
salmon
come
into
that
bay
in
one
week,
and
they
are
all
caught
during
that
period.
now,
the
state's
fishing
is
--
if
the
state
proposes
its
fishing
time
on
the
basis
that
a
certain
amount
of
days
will
be
kept
free
of
fishing
so
the
salmon
can
get
up
--
up
the
streams.
it
generally
allows
four,
five
days,
perhaps,
in
fishing
and
then
closes
it
for
another
two.
well,
suppose
they
embark
on
this
program
and
then
with
the
two
days
remaining
in
the
week,
they
close
down
their
fishery
and
the
federal
government
decides
that
the
natives
haven't
caught
enough,
so
they
open
it.
then
what
happens?
you
have
half
the
fishermen
in
the
state
fishing
in
bristol
bay
and
half
the
fishermen
not.
the
state's
carefully
plan
program
of
five
days
and
two
days
close
goes
right
down
the
drain
to
the
detriment
of
everybody.
now,
it's
true,
that
--
that
--
it's
been
pointed
out
that
the
federal
government
will
undoubtedly
be
guided
by
thoughts
of
conservation.
this
is
--
this
is
been
--
been
reiterated
in
the
briefs,
but
the
trouble
is
with
this
that
the
claims
are
conflicting.
the
real
matter
--
the
reason
this
--
these
traps
are
been
authorized
is
because
the
secretary
wants
the
metlakatla
cannery
along
with
those
in
kake
and
angoon
to
have
more
fish
than
they
would
have
otherwise.
that's
been
made
quite
clear.
he
wants
them
to
make
--
be
in
economic
successes.
well,
that's
just
the
point
in
alaska.
too
many
people
have
made
economic
successes,
and
there
are
not
enough
fish
any
more.
so
they
are
trying
to
close
it
down.
they
are
trying
to
close
it
down
either
in
stages
or
whole
areas,
but
if
we
can't
do
this,
if
--
if
the
only
consideration
is
the
economic
benefit
of
this
particular
alaskan
communities,
who
are,
as
i
say,
full
alaskan
citizens,
what
can
we
do?
this
is
half
the
fishermen
of
the
state
we're
talking
about
now,
not
--
not
of
little
isolated
indian
community
off
in
some
place,
we're
talking
about
half
the
fishermen
of
the
state.
now
that's
--
that's
the
broadest
interpretation.
the
second
interpretation
is
taken
in
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
if
you
sustain
these
claims
as
fishing
rights,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
any
action
taken
by
the
federal
government
to
regulate
indian
fishing
whether
it's
a
trap
or
closing
an
area,
opening
an
area
will
be
equally
an
indian
fishing
right.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
there
are
--
half
of
the
industries
of
the
state
are
natives
and
half
of
the
industry
of
the
state
can
claim
that
they
were
using
some
form
of
equipment
under
the
white
act
in
1959.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
we
do
not
admit
that,
your
honor.
that
is
what
the
government
claims.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
the
--
yes,
this
is
essentially
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
in
fact.
because
and
--
and
this
is
what
i'm
saying,
because
the
regu
--
the
use
of
fish
trap
was
no
different
than
the
use
of
any
other
form
of
gear
and
we
know
that
half
the
fishermen
in
the
state
were
using
some
form
of
gear,
half
the
fishermen
are
natives.
so,
if
this
right
is
--
is
a
right
--
if
this
is
a
right
that
we're
talking
about
here,
so
was
the
use
of
nets?
this
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
other
--
other
particular
forms
to
fishing
equipment?
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
they
have
not
been
now,
but
they
maybe
--
they
--
in
fact
they
are
from
a
time
to
time
basis.
for
instance,
in
--
in
various
areas
of
the
state
nets
of
only
one
length
are
allowed.
they
are
not
allowed
to
use
larger
nets,
you
see.
now,
if
--
if
we're
talking
about
a
frozen
claim,
theoretically
the
natives
could
go
back
in
1959,
any
native
fishermen
now
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
no,
by
native,
i
mean
native
fishermen,
any
native
fishermen.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
any
indian
or
for
that
matter
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
it
could
be
that
or
for
that
matter,
it
could
be
a
native
community.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
it
--
well,
to
us
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
true
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
true,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
let
me
explain
why
i
take
this
position.
the
federal
government
in
its
brief
restricted
its
claim
to
indian
communities.
it
did,
but
the
reason
i
don't
feel
this
claim
can
be
sustained
is
because
it's
inconsistent.
we're
talking
about
a
right
held
by
natives
or
the
federal
government
for
natives.
now,
whether
an
individual
or
a
community
or
a
corporation
or
any
organized
body
under
the
white
act
used
a
trap
or
any
other
fishing
gear,
it
did
not
give
them
any
right.
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
was
an
individual
or
a
community
or
anything.
so
what
i'm
saying
is
if
you
sustain
it
for
a
community
you
have,
in
a
sense,
sustained
it
for
an
individual,
too.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
entirely
correct,
your
honor,
but
we're
not
speaking
here
today
about
any
indian
--
aboriginal
indian
tribe
as
i
understand
it.
the
decisions
of
--
of
every
court
that
has
ever
passed
on
this
subject
has
--
has
decided
that
we
are
not
talking
about
a
tribal
entity.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
you
mean
a
community
under
the
wheeler-howard
act?
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
well,
this
is
--
of
course,
when
we
speak
of
a
community
under
the
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
very
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
wheeler-howard
act
provided
that
indians
could
organize
into
corporations,
which
these
appellants
have
done,
but
it
was
never
said
in
their
--
to
their
economic
benefit
that
these
corporations
could
fish
free
of
the
general
regulations
in
alaska.
and
they
did
not
fish
free
of
them
and
any
corporation
private
or
governmental
that
was
fishing
under
these
regulations
did
not
gain
a
right
through
use
of
a
fish
trap.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
well,
as
i
understand
the
doctrines
of
indian
law,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
an
indian
is
no
longer
a
member
of
a
tribe,
does
not
make
a
crucial
difference.
the
power
over
tribes
also
extends
to
individual
indians.
now
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
--
that's
true,
but
these
indians
in
southeastern
alaska,
if
you
are
going
to
classify
them,
any
form
of
tribe
whatsoever
for
powers
of
federal
indian
law,
all
of
the
appellants
belong
and
every
indian,
perhaps,
well,
i
shouldn't
--
i
shouldn't
say
every
indian,
i
can't
--
i
can't
make
a
definite
statement
as
to
the
percentage
of
indians
that
belong
to
this,
what
you
would
term
loosely
family
groups
connected
into
what
we
would
term
a
tribe.
i
cannot
--
(voice
overlap)
i
think
i
see
what
you're
asking
for.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes,
but
i
need
not
take
that
position,
justice
frankfurter
and
if
it
raises
the
question
in
you
mind,
i
need
not
--
i
won't
–
won't
do
so.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
if
it
were
an
indian
community,
it
would
make
no
difference.
if
we
take
a
stream
in
southeastern
alaska,
in
which
the
fish
come
and
the
state
program
is
regulated
on
the
basis
of
how
many
fish
get
into
that
stream,
and
kake
as
a
native
community
under
the
wheeler-howard
act,
is
allowed
to
fish
free
of
state
regulation
or
for
that
matter
the
government
decides
to
give
it
an
additional
privilege
in
relation
to
the
stream,
the
state
program
is
of
no
avail
whatsoever
and
can't
be
planed
at
all.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
are
not
reachable
by
the
state
law?
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
true.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
think
that
term
exclusive
right
in
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
government
can
mean
nothing
else.
i
--
i
agree
with
you
completely,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
alright.
now
finally,
i
wish
to
point
out
one
last
thing,
i
wish
to
let
mr.
--
attorney
general
moody
conclude
the
argument,
but
i
do
want
to
talk
about
kake
and
angoon's
claim
for
one
last
minute.
kake
and
angoon
came
--
claim
aboriginal
rights
in
an
area.
now,
i've
already
pointed
out
to
this
court
why
i
believe
that
aboriginal
rights
were
extinguished,
but
let's
assume
for
a
moment
that
they
were
not.
i
want
to
show
the
court
the
effect
of
this.
now,
they
have
minimized
their
claim
to
aboriginal
rights.
if
the
court
will
look
in
the
tlingit
and
haida
cases
which
in
--
in
the
court
of
claims
which
maxed
out
the
area
claimed
by
these
indians,
they
will
find
that
it
occupies
all
of
southeastern
alaska.
this
isn't
small
area.
this
is
all
of
southeastern
alaska.
now
those
of
you
who
have
seen
a
map
of
alaska
or
been
in
alaska
will
realize
the
vast
expanse
of
area
this
really
is.
and
it's
a
tremendous
fishery
down
there,
too.
now,
if
kake
and
angoon
are
right,
in
the
area
where
kake
and
angoon
fish,
in
that
whole
southeastern
alaskan
area,
aboriginal
area
we're
talking
about,
they
can
fish
free
of
state
regulations
of
any
kind
and
if
they
can,
i
point
out
that
the
states'
power
now
in
southeastern
alaska
is
--
is
nothing.
it
can't
regulate
if
they
can
only
regulate
half
of
it
--
the
people.
this
court
recognizes
in
missouri
against
holland
when
it
was
talking
about
migratory
birds.
now,
it
--
if
i
can
--
if
i
can
draw
an
analogy
here
in
--
the
court
said
that
missouri
can't
regulate
migratory
birds
because
everybody
has
to
be
bound
by
a
scheme
of
conservation
when
you're
talking
about
migratory
animals.
because
anyone
person
could
destroy
the
whole
program,
but
we're
talking
about
migratory
salmon
here.
these
salmon
pass
hundreds
of
miles
of
coastline
before
they
enter
the
streams.
now,
how
is
the
state
to
plan
its
fishing
effort
along
those
hundreds
of
miles
of
coastline
if
it
doesn't
know
how
the
federal
government
is
going
to
run
its
programs
in
regard
to
these
aboriginal
claims.
in
summary,
i
just
want
to
say,
that
if
the
court
upholds
this
right
today,
this
claimed
right,
alaska's
fight
to
gain
control
over
its
fisheries
is
gone.
we
--
we
have
gained
nothing.
we
have
gained
a
power
to
regulate
one-half
of
the
fishing
population
and
that
is
next
to
nothing,
if
we
can't
regulate
the
other
half.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
certainly.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
what
to
--
over
all
indians?
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
oh!
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
would
say
this
justice
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
there
is
no
question
that
the
federal
government
retains
plenary
power,
as
it
does
in
other
areas
over
all
indian
tribes.
that
much
is
clear.
as
to
individual
indians,
we
will
be
faced
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
non-tribal
collectivities
organized
under
federal
law?
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
well,
i
would
venture
to
say
that
--
that
it
probably
would
be
impossible
for
non-tribal
indians
to
be
organized
under
federal
law
as
indians.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
they
are
--
this
is
a
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
this
is
a
different
kind
of
organization,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
it
is
unique
to
the
indian
groups,
but
it
is
a
different
type
of
tribe
when
we
speak
of
it
in
the
state.
i
would
concede
that
--
that
a
wide
leeway,
in
fact
almost
complete
leeway,
is
giving
the
federal
government
in
determining
what
shall
be
termed
a
tribe
and
if
they
decide
that
even
indians
which
i
or
--
or
perhaps
this
court
might
determine
are
non-tribal
indians
or
nonetheless
tribal
indian
–
indians,
it
has
been
the
policy
of
this
court
in
the
past
to
not
argue
the
point
with
them
--
with
the
federal
authority.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
but
in
--
in
the
kagama
--
in
the
sandoval
case,
it
also
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
it
did
not
mean
the
congress
could
make
an
arbitrary
determination
of
who
belong
to
a
tribe.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
the
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
do
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
would
doubt
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
there
comes
of
point
where
the
federal
exercise
of
control
becomes
arbitrary
within
the
meaning
of
the
kagama
case
and
there
--
and
the
sandoval
case
and
at
this
point,
it
must
cease
and
i
think
this
court
could
so
holds.
but
what
i
am
indicating
here
is,
we're
not
--
under
our
interpretation
of
section
4,
congress
did
not
retain
control
over
the
indian
fishing
in
alaska.
the
only
person
that
disclaimed
this
is
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
if
his
interpretation
is
incorrect,
we
are
not
faced
with
the
problem
of
--
to
what
extent
congress
could
control
the
indians,
because
they
have
expressly
not
done
so.
now,
if
in
the
future
they
pass
a
statute
which
does
so,
then
the
question,
i
think,
which
you
have
posed
would
arise.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
it
most
certainly
does.
it
operates
on
--
on
various
rights
which
i
have
mentioned
here
and
certainly,
the
subsistence
rights
on
the
kuskokwim
river
are
held
by
tribal
indians.
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
karluk
reservation
is
for
the
karluk
tribe
of
indians
and
--
and
the
hynes
case
points
this
out.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that's
true.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
well,
i
think
if
there
were
--
but
two
rights,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
clause
would
be
satisfied.
there
would
be
two
indian
rights
and
they
are
--
and
they
are
of
the
enormous
importance.
when
you
say
a
generalized
term,
i
think
you
mean
it
takes
more
than
one
and
--
and
it
does.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
well,
there
are
not
--
there
are
--
i
believe
i
gave
three
specifics,
but
subsistence
fishing,
as
you
have
just
pointed
out,
is
a
generalized
thing.
and
every
tribal
indian
and
alaska
which
possesses
--
which
--
which
--
which
has
aboriginal
subsistence
fishing
rights,
i
believe,
would
probably
be
entitled
to
retain
them
under
this
act,
free
of
state
regulation.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
subsistence
fishing
rights
could
not
do
so,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
it
may.
it
may
indeed,
but
you
have
i
–
i'm
--
this
--
to
my
of
thinking
would
be
a
valid
interpretation
of
section
4.
i
would
be
happy
to
see
this
court
say
that
these
were
not
rights
that
were
preserved
under
section
4,
but
--
but
i
recognized
that
there
maybe
a
valid
claim
if
there
are.
and
this
is
important
i
think,
because
subsistence
fishing
rights
are
at
least
limited
by
the
needs
of
the
population.
the
needs
of
the
natives
in
alaska,
there
food
needs,
but
on
the
other
hand,
commercial
fishing
rights
aren't
limited
by
anything,
except
the
desire
to
make
money.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
--
in
this
case,
i
believe
it
would
only
supplement
it,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
well,
there
maybe
instances
it
is
true
in
which
--
in
which
some
program
of
the
state
may
interfere
with
the
subsistence
fishing
rights
of
natives
or
vice
versa,
i
should
say.
and
in
--
in
cases
were
valid
retentions
of
federal
power
conflict
with
state
police
power,
we
would
certainly
recognize
that
the
state
police
power
must
yield.
but
that
i
believe,
this
is
a
future
question
whereas
today
our
only
problem
is
whether
we
can
regulate
our
biggest
industry
or
not.
at
this
point,
i'd
like
to
let
mr.
moody
conclude
the
argument.
thank
you.
