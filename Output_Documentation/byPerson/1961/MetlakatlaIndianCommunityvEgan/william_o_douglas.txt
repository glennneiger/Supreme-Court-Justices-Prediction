justice
william
o.
douglas
how
about
(inaudible)
in
this
legal
question
though?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
we
--
if
we
were
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
we
have
authority
to
regulate
these
things,
those
things
would
be
very,
very
relevant,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
secretary
of
interior
now
has
anymore
authority,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
suppose
you
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
these
rights
of
the
indian
and
such
whatever
they
may
be
is
contensible,
are
contensible?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
going
to
talk
about
section
16?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
that's
--
is
that
all
relevant
to
our
problem?
because
apparently,
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
reason
i
mention
this
because
you
refer
to
the
department
of
the
interior
and
its
regulations,
but
under
section
6
(e)
as
i
understand
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
6
(e)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
that's
not
there
--
that's
not
the
problem
of
6
--
of
6
(e)
is
whether
as
i
understand
it,
whether
not
the
certificate
issued
pursuant
to
section
6
(e),
it
give
or
should
have
given
the
state
of
alaska
full
jurisdiction
over
--
says
fish
and
wildlife
resources,
doesn't
it?
are
those
the
words?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
that's
possible
because
that's
one
of
the
questions
we
have
to
decide.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
section
4.
i
was
wondering
--
i
was
wondering,
the
laws
adopted
by
--
alaska
adopted
laws
in
1959
after
statehood
to
regulate
fishing
generally,
isn't
it,
by
everybody?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
the
secretary
thereupon
made
this
certificate
as
--
that
the
effect
of
alaska
had
taken
over
the
field
of
regulation
of
wildlife
and
fishing,
didn't
he?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
precludes.
i
just
want
to
kind
of
run
out
the
picture
of
what
happened.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
quite
say
that.
it
says
it
has
made
adequate
provision
for
the
administration
management
in
conservation
of
fish
and
wildlife.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
certainly
the
words
administration
management
and
conservation
of
fish
would
include
the
regulation
--
i
would
assume
it
would
include
regulations
concerning
trapping
of
fish.
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
--
you're
covered
also
by
the
secretary
of
interior's
regulation?
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
in
1960?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
within
the
--
was
it
a
technically
reservation
also?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
treaty
still
enforced?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
seems
to
as
far
what
it
says
is
concerned,
seems
to
react
against
the
use
of
the
trap,
i'm
reading
on
page
29
(a)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
in
the
number
two
case,
which
says,
“under
the
power,
it
has
not
been
unusual
for
a
single
trap
to
catch
as
many
as
600,000
fish
in
a
single
season
as
compared
to
a
season's
catch
of
gillnet
or
purse
seine
fisherman
to
the
10,000.
it
--
the
prejudice,
it
seems
in
this
opinion,
be
not
--
the
traps
were
the
budge
colonialism
but
the
traps
were
the
way
for
massive
extermination
of
fish.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
whatever
that
maybe,
as
i
read
the
legislative
history
was
left
for
legislative
--
future
legislative
and/or
judicial
determination,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i've
been
able
to
find
anything
that
describes
with
clarity
with
which
you
plead
what
these
fishing
rights
were.
justice
william
o.
douglas
keep
coming
back
in
legislative
history
to
the
phrase
or
such
as
a
legislature
or
congress
or
the
courts
show
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
could
have
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
secretary
then
can
abolish
all
these
traps
for
next
season
if
he
wanted
to
do.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
the
--
the
view
of
the
interior
department?
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course
there
are
some
--
the
fishing
resources
as
i
gather
in
alaska
had
been
so
seriously
depleted
that
some
had
even
able
talked
about
stopping
all
fishing.
justice
william
o.
douglas
for
year
or
two.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
that's
whether
you
applied
fisherman
or
–
[laughter]
justice
william
o.
douglas
to
exercise
indian
fishing
rights,
you
have
to
fish
with
the
trap,
i
gather.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
any
of
them
use
dynamite
or
explosives
to
kill
fish?
justice
william
o.
douglas
some
people
say
that's
--
that's
the
way
of
getting
rid
of
the
fish?
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
many
of
them
are
--
have
become
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
all
of
them?
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
have
segregated
schools
for
indians
there
now?
