justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
can
you
just
state
shortly,
you
only
have
five
minutes
left.
what
the
switch
in
position
is?
i
haven't
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
it's
so
--
it's
narrow
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
significance
you've
just
suggested
of
federal
aid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
this
was
the
reason
for
the
shift
of
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
curiosity
but
why
did
the
united
states
invite
to
come
to
british
columbia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
white
man,
although
born
in
alaska
currently
is
not
a
native
man.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
wrong
that
6
(e)
had
as
primary
purpose,
provided
opportunity
to
the
state
of
alaska.
they
passed
regulatory
laws
which
satisfactory
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
would
then
make
possible
certification
which
he
did
make
after
the
1959
laws
were
adopted
which
became
effective
90
days
after
something
like
that,
wasn't
that
idea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
(voice
overlap).
i
just
have
some
recollection
at
the
time
that
application
per
se
was
before
me
that
there
was
a
suggestion
that
this
transition
was
necessary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
part
to
allow
the
secretary
to
be
satisfied
with
the
laws
that
in
--
were
adopted,
would
not
be
in
consistent
with
the
general
pattern
of
regulation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
but
wasn't
it
to
some
idea
that
the
enforcement
apparatus
before
the
certificate
would
be
granted
had
to
be
satisfactory
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
had
to
be
satisfied
that
they
were
consistent
with
the
protection
of
--
of
wildlife
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
indeed,
what
was
the
name
of
the
chap
whose
name
was
given
to
this
proviso?
it
was
called
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
westland
proviso
and
he
was
--
he
was
very
concerned
that
alaska
might
do
things
which
were
not
in
the
national
interest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
matters
of
conservation
and
such,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
he
a
great
sportsman
or
something
i
forgot.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
the
national
golf
champion
â€“
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
--
that
was
the
set
of
facts
mr.
davis,
before
me
on
the
application
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
certification
had
not
yet
become
effective
as
i
recall?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
there
are
21
fixed
sites.
that's
the
point.
he
can't
move
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
21,
helter-skelter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
whether
it's
11
or
21,
in
any
event,
they
are
fixed
site?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
pinpoint
territorially
whether
they
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
you
can
never
catch
one
of
those
salmons
of
that
size
on
the
fly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
this
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
does
that
mean
this
too
that
if
the
secretary
now
may
change
his
mind
and
not
authorize
use
of
any
these
traps,
but
indians
went
ahead
nevertheless
and
used
it
and
any
sanctions
would
have
to
be
imposed
under
some
federal
law
could
not
in
any
event
permit
alaska
to
impose
its
criminal
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
has
the
provisions
of
the
white
act
too,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
first
time,
i
just
asked
two
questions,
has
the
secretary
of
the
interior
yet
promulgated
the
authorization
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
coming
season?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
my
second
question
is,
there's
presently
outstanding
stay
against
the
enforcement
of
the
alaskan
statutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
view
with
the
appellants
here
prevails,
what's
your
view
of
the
remedies,
should
that
stay
made
permanent
or
is
a
new
declaration
sufficient?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
--
the
request
for
release,
i
haven't
check
it
again,
but
am
i
not
right
initially
before
the
territorial
court
it
was
for
injunctive
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
have
affirmatively
dissolved
the
outstanding
stay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
its
customary
not
to
grant
injunction
but
take
for
granted
which
what
you've
said
(inaudible)
or
any
others.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
difference
here
though
and
that's
the
reason
i
raised
the
question
is
that
they
have
an
outstanding
stay
against
the
governor
and
the
other
officials
of
alaska.
we
have
affirmatively
dissolved
the
outstanding
stay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
--
do
i
understand
the
concession
goes
this
far,
if
in
fact
rights
include
the
use
of
traps,
alaska
now
raises
no
constitutional
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
section
of
the
power
of
congress
who
reserved
the
right
to
regulate
the
use
of
fish
trap,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
really
we
do
in
both
cases
that
before
us
now
based
on
the
state's
concession,
only
the
question
of
what
is
meant
--
the
congress
means
by
rights.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
acts,
i
assume
you're
coming
to
it,
do
i
get
your
argument
in
effect
in
this
that
under
the
white
act
provision
no
exclusive
for
several
right
of
fishery
shall
be
granted
etcetera,
effectively
destroyed,
whatever
it
was
either
of
this
may
have
had
and
that
all
the
section
4
did
was
the
--
including
indian
fishing
rights
was
to
save
a
lawsuit
and
to
confirm
your
view
that
they
had
nothing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
and
then
what
i
do
hope
you're
going
to
get
to
that
is
what
was
it
that
including
indian
fishing
rights
(voice

reserved?

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
