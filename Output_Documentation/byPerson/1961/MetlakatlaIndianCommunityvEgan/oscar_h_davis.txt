mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government
in
support
of
the
position
of
the
appellants
that
the
state
of
alaska
has
no
power
to
impose
its
fish
trap
regulations
upon
these
appellants,
but
rather
that
the
continued
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
over
these
matters
still
resides
within
the
control
of
federal
government
acting
through
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
perhaps
before
i
begin
my
affirmative
argument
in
support
of
the
appellant's
position,
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
try
to
--
in
my
answer
to
a
several
of
the
particular
questions
which
had
been
raised
by
members
of
the
court.
first,
with
relation
to
section
6
(e)
which
is
--
and
the
westland
proviso,
the
statehood
act
itself
provided
that
for
--
that
fisheries
and
wildlife
resources
should
not
be
transferred
to
the
state,
but
continue
on
the
federal
control
where
they've
been
since
alaska
become
a
territory
until
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
satisfied
that
alaska
has
provided
appropriate
fishing
and
wildlife
resource
legislation
in
the
broad
national
interest
and
then
it
provided
for
certification
and
in
--
if
he
was
so
satisfied
and
then
the
--
the
resources
and
the
enforcement
machinery
will
be
turnover
to
alaska.
now,
the
secretary
did
make
the
certification
on
april
1959,
shortly
after
alaska
became
a
state,
alaska
became
a
state
on
january
3,
1959.
but
i
think
it's
important
mr.
justice
brennan
to
point
out
that
at
the
time
the
secretary
made
that
certification,
two
things
were
in
existence.
one,
he'd
already
proposed
to
continue
his
fishing
regulations
with
relation
to
these
appellants.
he
had
issued
a
proposed
regulation
permitting
these
appellants
to
continue
and
two,
the
alaska
statute
which
was
then
in
effect,
the
alaska
statute
prohibiting
fish
traps
said
nothing
in
this
statute
shall
be
construed
to
violate
section
4
of
the
statehood
act
which
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
certification
did
not
become
effective
until
january
1,
1960.
but
what
i
just
want
to
point
out
is
that
the
secretary
did
not
file
the
certification,
assumed
that
the
alaska
fish
traps
statutes
applied
to
these
appellant
indians
because
he
himself
had
continued
to
regulate
them
and
the
statute,
the
alaska
statute
which
was
then
in
effect
contained
a
section
which
said,
“nothing
in
this
statute
shall
contravene
anything
in
section
4
of
the
statehood
act.”
now,
we're
precluded
from
arguing
on
the
basis
of
the
alaska
statute
because
the
alaska
supreme
court
has
since
that
the
time
construed
it
to
apply
to
these
appellants'
fish
traps.
now,
as
to
what
the
power
of
the
secretary
would
be
as
to
these
indians
or
other
indians
in
the
future,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
in
point
of
view
of
the
federal
government,
he
does
not
have
power
at
large.
section
4
refers
to
fishing
rights
held
at
the
time
of
statehood,
held
at
the
time
of
statehood.
and
as
we
construe
section
4,
if
i
may
intervene
to
go
back
just
a
minute,
section
6
(e)
was
in
the
statehood
act.
that's
the
transfer
of
jurisdiction
over
wildlife
and
fishing
to
the
state,
but
section
4
was
also
on
the
statehood
act,
the
very
same
act
provided
for
reservation
of
indian
fishing
rights
and
so
that
section
4
read
in
pairing
material
with
section
6
(e)
reserved
fishing
rights
whatever
that
maybe.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right
mr.
justice
douglas,
with
this
exception
that
they
did
not
want
to
make
any
change.
they
wanted
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
they
very
clearly
did
not
want
to
grant
any
rights
to
indians
or
take
away
weight.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
will
try
in
a
moment
to
reach
that.
i
was
just
trying
to
--
to
answer
some
of
the
specific
questions
and
the
burden
of
my
argument
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
i
will
try
to
deal
with
that
mr.
justice
douglas
but
before
i
do,
i
just
wanted
to
answer
the
--
the
question
as
to
what
the
power
of
the
secretary
was
in
our
view
with
relation
to
these
indians
or
other
indians.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
kake
and
angoon.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
while,
i
think
it's
--
it's
even
more
precise
than
that
mr.
because
the
sec
--
at
the
time
of
statehood,
the
secretary
had
said
that
there
were
21
fish
traps
sites
as
a
whole
for
all
three
groups,
21.
he
only
authorized
11
traps,
but
there
were
21
sites
as
a
whole,
all
within
the
same
general
area.
in
our
view,
he
can
extend
to
the
21
sites,
that
is
he
can
increase
the
number
of
fish
traps
from
11
to
21,
which
were
at
that
time
in
existence
for
these
groups.
he
can
decrease
it.
he
cannot
go
beyond
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
number
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
he
cannot
go
beyond
the
21.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
yes
sir,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
now,
i
should
make
it
clear
to
the
court
that
this
is
the
view
of
department
of
justice,
the
department
of
the
interior
thinks
he
can't
go
beyond
the
11
which
were
in
actual
existence
at
the
moment
of
statehood.
well,
he
hasn't
tried
to
go
beyond
the
11
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
decide
that
issue
because
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right
and
he
cannot
move
them
around.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
a
difficult
question
mr.
justice.
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
he
could
not
make
a
change
and
at
the
time
of
statehood,
they
were
fish
traps
and
that
was
--
that
was
the
fishing
right
they
had,
but
--
but
i
don't
wish
to
give
a
--
a
definitive
answer.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right
mr.
justice.
now,
the
--
as
mr.
schifter
pointed
out
yesterday,
there's
a
very
great
difference
between
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
and
the
position
taken
by
the
state
in
its
brief
which
was
filed
a
week
ago.
if
i
may,
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
be
with
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alaska,
which
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
has
not
thought
it
necessary
to
support
in
his
brief
because
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
to
the
court
that
in
our
view,
the
propositions
--
the
legal
propositions
announced
by
the
supreme
of
alaska
are
wrong,
and
--
and
should
be
repudiated
by
this
court
because
they
have
a
--
well
radiation
beyond
this
particular
case
with
relation
to
the
indians
of
alaska.
i
do
not
intend
unless
the
court
should
wish
me
to
stand
a
great
deal
of
time
on
--
on
--
on
these
issues
because
the
state
does
not
seek
to
support
them,
but
i
would
like
to
state
our
position
on
it.
and
the
first
position
is
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
said
that
the
indian
power
of
congress
does
not
extend
to
alaska.
it
may
extend
to
the
rest
of
the
continental
united
states
but
it
does
not
extend
to
alaska.
that
is
refuted
by
any
--
by
three
or
four
decisions
of
this
court
which
the
alaska
pacific
fisheries
case
and
(inaudible)
case
and
hynes
against
grimes
packing
and
decisions
in
the
lower
courts
which
have
held
that
--
that
the
indian
power
of
congress
does
extend
to
alaska.
it's
--
it's
refuted
by
the
consistent
legislative
congress
from
the
time
it
began
rarely
to
legislate
for
alaska
in
1884
and
the
organic
act
of
1884
in
which
made
special
provision
for
--
for
alaska
indians.
it's
refuted
by
the
metlakatla
legislation
by
the
extension
of
the
wheeler-howard
act,
the
indian
reorganization
act,
one
of
the
great
charters
of
indian
progress
in
this
country
to
alaska.
it's
--
it's
even
refuted
by
the
provisions
of
the
19
--
1953
statue
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
asking
about,
extending
criminal
jurisdiction
to
alaska
but
excluding
fishing
plan.
so
i
think
there's
really
nothing
to
that
point.
and
the
second
point,
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
makes
or
suggests
is
that
equal
footing
prevents
a
reservation
by
the
federal
government
as
we
think
it
tried
to
do
in
section
4
of
the
statehood
act,
of
rights
with
relation
to
indians
and
alaska
and
again
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
mr.
cragun
has
indicated
consistently
hold
otherwise.
what
the
court
has
held
is
that
in
a
statehood
act,
the
federal
government
can
reserve
rights
which
it
would
have
the
power
to
exercise
under
the
regular
granted
provisions
of
the
constitution.
in
coyle
against
oklahoma,
the
case
which
said
oklahoma
couldn't
--
could
not
be
prevented
from
moving
its
capital
from
guthrie
to
oklahoma
by
prohibition
in
the
oklahoma
city
by
prohibition
in
statehood
act,
the
court
three
times
when
out
of
its
way
to
indicate
that
with
respect
to
those
matters,
particularly
indian
matters
which
the
federal
government
have
granted
powers
on
the
commerce
clause,
of
course
it
could
reserve
powers.
and
--
and
this
was
repeated
in
the
sandoval
and
other
cases.
and
i
think
almost
every
statehood
act
since
the
1880's
or
1870's
has
contained
a
reservation
with
relation
to
indians
except
hawaii
which
has
no
indians
and
they've
contained
a
reservation
with
relation
to
hawaiian
natives
in
that
statute.
and
so
that's
the
second
point
of
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
which
i
think
it's
just
wrong
if
may
say
so
with
respect
to
the
court.
then
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
seem
to
think
that
the
reservation
in
section
4
which
reserves
to
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
federal
government
land
and
property
held
by
for
the
indians
including
fishing
rights,
reserve
that
--
that
that
failed
because
the
--
there
wasn't
a
meeting
of
their
minds
between
the
state
of
alaska
and
congress.
now,
we
spell
at
the
answer
to
that
in
our
--
in
our
brief
and
i
think
for
the
short
answer
that
i
may
say
is
that
the
alaska
statehood
act
provided
that
the
people
of
alaska
would
have
to
take
a
vote
on
the
entire
statement
under
--
under
disclaimer
provision,
the
one
we
have
here
and
if
they
adopted
it,
as
they
did,
the
constitution
of
alaska
shall
be
deemed
to
be
amended
in
pursuance
thereto.
so,
i
think
there's
nothing
to
that
point.
then
the
last
point
made
by
the
--
by
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
in
this
respect
is
that
the
omnibus
act
amendments,
that's
the
amendment
which
--
which
said
that
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
united
states
didn't
continue
for
federally
owned
lands
generally
and
only
for
lands
which
were
held
by
for
the
natives,
but
that
was
invalid
because
it
was
passed
after
statehood.
the
state
does
not
rest
on
that
because
i
think
it
would
not
want
that
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
that
it
received
under
that
act
over
federal
lands
generally
to
be
invalidated,
but
i
think
that
legally
speaking,
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
was
erroneous
there
to.
because
first,
it's
very
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
thought
it
was
correcting
an
error.
it
says
in
the
--
in
the
reports,
we
intended
to
limit
this
after
jurisdiction
and
control
only
to
native,
to
indian
lands
and
we
inadvertently
did
more
and
of
course
there's
a
tremendous
area
of
alaska
which
--
in
alaska
would
be
deprived
of
the
police
power
if
the
words
were
taken
literally,
and
that's
why
they
amended
it.
i
should
say
--
i
think
there
were
questions
asked
about
public
lands
in
alaska.
the
statehood
act
does
contain
provisions
for
setting
aside
of
defense
area
of
alaska
in
which
the
federal
government
would
have
exclusive
provision
--
exclusive
authority
completely
but
that's
in
a
separate
section
with
its
own
powers
and
authority.
as
to
the
other
public
lands
and
--
and
this
defense
area
was
limited
geographically
to
a
certain
section
of
alaska,
as
to
the
others,
commerce
has
made
it
clear
that
the
normal
civil
and
clinical
jurisdiction
extends
to
the
federal
lands.
now,
i
think
i
would
like
to
turn
to
what
i
consider
in
which
i
think
the
state
considers
now,
the
really
basic
issue
in
this
case
which
is
--
what
is
meant
by
the
term
fishing
rights
in
section
4?
i
wish
to
make
it
clear
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government
that
fishing
rights
that
i
espoused
here,
we
do
not
think
of
vested
or
compensable
as
against
the
federal
government.
that
is
we
don't
think
the
court
has
to
decide
this
issue
in
this
case
at
all.
i
just
wish
to
make
it
clear
so
that
there
be
no
misapprehension
as
to
position
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
sometimes
we
found
that
--
that
--
it
must
be
make
it
clear
counsel
thinks
that
(voice
overlap)
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear
that
--
that
we
think
that
these
are
fishing
rights
which
are
protected
us
against
the
state
of
alaska
and
are
protected
in
which
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can
control
and
regulate.
they're
contestable
in
the
sense
that
if
the
secretary
should
refuse
to
continue
them
or
congress
should
say
that
secretary
stop
fishing
traps
in
alaska
or
if
this
court
should
hold
against
us
and
say
that
alaska
can
regulate
that
they
would
be
no
suit
in
the
court
of
claim
saying
that,
“by
section
4
we
gave
up
these
rights.”
but
with
that
disclaimer
which
i
think
the
court
may
not
reach
at
all
in
this
case.
we
do
think
that
--
that
the
fishing
rights
which
were
protected,
which
are
protected
by
section
4
are
involved
in
this
particular
case.
what
is
our
view
of
what
a
fishing
right
within
the
meaning
of
section
4?
our
feeling
is
that
if
say
a
permission,
a
license,
a
privilege,
a
right
on
actual
fishing
by
or
in
behalf
of
indians
as
indians
under
the
aegis
of
the
federal
government.
now,
those
are
general
words
and
i
will
try
to
fill
them
out
with
relation
to
the
particular
groups
here.
as
mr.
schifter
has
pointed
out,
from
1891,
the
metlakatla's
have
been
subject
to
the
supervision
and
jurisdiction
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
both
congress
and
the
president
have
made
very
clear
that
they
have
fishing
rights
in
--
in
their
reserve.
they
are
spelled
out
in
the
president's
executive
order.
it's
made
very
clear
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
alaska
pacific
fisheries
case.
it's
assumed
and
confirmed
by
congress
in
the
various
statutes.
so
these
fishing
rights
come
under
a
federal
statute.
they
come
under
complex
of
federal
statutes
with
relation
to
metlakatla.
they
are
not
vested
we
think
and
the
metlakatla's
do
not
claim
they're
vested,
but
they
are
fishing
rights
under
a
federal
statute,
which
were
in
existence
at
the
time
of
statehood.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
what
i
mean
by
not
vested
is
that
if
the
congress
repealed
the
statutes,
they
could
not
sue
the
united
states.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
are
not
vested
as
against
united
states.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
as
against
alaska,
as
against
private
parties
not
as
against
the
united
states.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
that's
right.
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
true.
now,
to
go
on
to
the
kake
and
angoon,
which
are
in
a
little
different
situation
but
we
think
basically
not
dissimilar
mr.
justice
whittaker
because
the
situation
in
those
cases
is
this.
both
of
those
indian
communities
which
existed
as
any
to
communities
for
a
long
time
were
charted
under
the
wheeler-howard
act,
the
indian
reorganization
act.
and
that
we
think
is
a
terribly
significant
factor
because
the
wheeler-howard
act
provided,
and
i'd
like
--
if
i
could
to
give
the
tone
of
the
act
just
to
read
to
the
court
its
--
its
title
because
it's
very
important.
the
wheeler-howard
act
was
an
act
to
conserve
and
develop
indian
lands
and
resources,
to
extend
to
indians
the
right
to
form
business
in
other
organizations,
to
establish
a
credit
system
for
indians,
to
grant
indian
certain
rights
of
home
rule
provide
for
vocational
education
for
indians
and
this
was
extended
to
alaska.
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
encourage
these
indian
communities
to
develop
businesses
so
they
could
become
self-sufficient
and
self-sustaining
and
have
a
viable
community.
that
was
very
purpose.
under
it
--
under
it
the
secretary
of
the
interior
loaned
money
to
kake
and
angoon.
he
purchased
on
their
behalf
the
indian
canaries
which
they
operated.
those
indian
canaries
in
the
case
of
kake
and
angoon
are
held
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
indian
groups.
he
supervises
their
finances.
it's
all
part
of
the
--
of
the
purpose
of
the
wheeler-howard
act
to
encourage
these
indian
communities
to
become
viable
communities.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
but
i
mean
the
kake
and
angoon
do
not
have
the
special
statutes
referring
to
them
particularly
by
name
which
exist
in
metlakatla.
metlakatla
has
statutes
which
refer
to
them
by
name.
kake
and
angoon
do
not
have
statutes.
i'm
trying
to
point
out
that
though
kake
and
angoon
do
not
have
statutes
which
refer
to
them
by
name,
they
are
basically
in
the
same
position
that
as
general
statutes
which
congress
passed
and
which
congress
directed
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
use
for
indian
tribes
in
alaska,
he
used
for
these
two
groups.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
depends
upon
the
fact
that
they
were
exercising
under
federal
statutes
and
under
executive
orders
a
fishing
right
at
the
time
of
statehood.
and
i
think
that
kake
and
angoon
were
exercising
a
fishing
right
under
the
wheeler-howard
act
and
under
the
--
the
designation
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
they
could
use
fish
traps.
he
meant
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
further
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i'm
trying
to
share
that
this
was
pursuant
to
statute
of
congress
and
not
something
at
large
in
the
air.
that
was
a
pursuant
to
statute
of
congress
and
that
a
fishing
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
that
if
where
pursuant
to
statute
or
executive
order
or
long
used
and
occupation
recognized
by
congress,
that's
the
kind
of
fishing
right
which
congress
intended
to
protect
under
section
4.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
the
view
of
the
department
of
justice,
i
have
to
make
it
clear
that
the
interior
department
thinks
that
he
is
stuck
with
the
11
traps
and
that
he
cannot
himself
abolish
them.
but
in
the
view
of
department
of
justice,
he
can
abolish
that
he
has
the
right
in
our
view.
the
interior
department
as
indicated
in
our
brief
thinks
that
he
has
--
he
cannot
neither
nor
decrease
the
11
traps
which
were
in
existence
at
the
moment
of
statehood.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
the
view
of
the
interior
department.
we
do
not
take
that
view.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh
yes,
there's
no
doubt.
and
interior
has
no
doubt
that
congress
could.
i
mean
they
don't
have
any
examine
about
that.
now,
i
will
confess
that
there
isn't
very
much
in
the
legislative
history
which
bears
directly
of
the
meaning
of
the
term
fishing
rights
that
is
specifically.
there
is
this
background
that
congress
was
very
well
aware
of
how
important
fishing
rights
was
to
these
and
other
indians
in
alaska,
that
congress
was
very
much
aware
of
that.
congress
was
also
aware
of
the
--
of
the
great
antipodally
of
the
people
of
alaska
to
fish
traps
generally.
it
was
aware
of
and
even
though
it
was
of
that,
it
did
pass
section
4.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that
is
true.
but
there
is
--
there
is--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
as
you
know
mr.
justice,
though
the
people
of
alaska,
as
indicated
by
senator
gruening
in
--
on
the
floor
congress
and
(inaudible)
think
that
fish
traps
are
anti-conservation
devices,
the
interior
department
fish
and
wildlife
people
do
not
think
so.
they
think
that
a
fish
trap
appropriately
regulated
can
be
just
as
a
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
anyway,
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
no
evidence
on
this
issue
--
on
this
issue.
and
i
--
and
congress
was
fully
aware
of
the
--
of
the
conservation
claims
of
people
of
alaska.
they
were,
there's
--
i
think
two
or
three
surveys
of
this
and
congress
never
decided
the
issue
that
is
it
never
found
that
fish
traps
were
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
not
that
kind
of
sportsman
mr.
justice
brennan.
[laughter]
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right!
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
and
i
think
the
court
cannot
take
judicial
notice
of
it
and
there
has
been
no
proof
of
that
and
this
was
a
matter
that
congress
considered,
but
(voice
overlap)
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
a
sense
no,
that
congress
has
been
aware
of
the
claim
of
the
people
of
alaska
that
fish
traps
are
anti-conservation
devices,
and
knowing
that
claim
nevertheless
passed
this
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
and
i
would
think
that
mr.
justice
to
go
one
step
further
that
even
if
the
secretary
had
no
power
to
allow
fish
traps
one
reason
or
another,
that
would
not
give
authority
to
the
state
of
alaska
to
enforced
its
criminal
statutes.
you
would
have
to
sue
the
secretary
in
the
usual
way
and
have
to
set
aside
his
regulations.
the
state
of
alaska
would
not
have
power
to
enforce
its
criminal
statutes
and
that's
what
this
case
is
about
where
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
i
would
say
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
say
that.
i
would
say
that
--
the
secretary
did
have
--
of
course
had
a
regulation
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
say
that.
and
i
would
point
out
mr.
chief
justice
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
or
this
court,
always
this
court.
[laughter]
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
i'm
not
sure
of
that
mr.
justice
for
this
reason
that
in
his
present
regulations
the
secretary
in
many
other
respects
adapts
the
alaska
regulations
that
isn't
relation
to
under
things.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
right.
i
think
the
white
act
provisions
would
apply
and
that
that
federal
sections
would
--
would
also
apply.
i'm
not
certain
with
the
secretary
by
adoption
of
the
alaska
game
laws
or
fish
laws
couldn't
also
make
those
applicable.
in
the
--
as
i
mentioned
before,
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
point
you,
nothing
very
substantial
that
can
i
can
point
to,
defining
what
the
term
fishing
rights
is
in
section
4,
but
there
are
some
indications,
in
addition
to
the
general
history
of
the
background
of
this
case.
and
one
of
the
important
things
that
i
would
like
to
stress
is
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
importance
of
fishing
to
these
indian
communities
and
others
in
alaska.
that
was
a
very
important
factor
that
congress
was
aware
of
generally.
i
think
it
was
aware
perhaps
not
specifically
of
--
of
all
the
fishing
by
these
indian
groups,
certainly
they
aware
of
the
metlakatla
of
what
they've
been
doing.
they
--
i
think
congress
was
aware
the
fact
that
in
the
felix
cohen's
handbook
in
1940
and
his
handbook
on
indian
law
published
by
the
interior
department,
under
this
chapter
on
alaska
natives,
alaska
indians
under
the
rubric
fishing
and
hunting
rights,
he
discusses
this
along
with
others
that
is
--
i
think
the
attorney
general
will
indic
--
will
talk,
say
that
the
statute
is
limited
to
certain
specific
ceiling
rights
which
congress
gave
to
the
indians
that
very
--
and
natives
at
various
times.
but
what
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
in
1940,
felix
cohen
in
the
authoritative
handbook
talking
about
fishing
and
hunting
rights
in
alaska
for
alaska
indians,
refer
to
these
fish
trap
types
of
--
of
commissions
as
part
of
the
--
of
the
fishing
rights
of
the
indians
in
alaska
as
well
as
the
others.
now,
governor
heintzleman
of
alaska
who
was
the
governor
in
1954
at
a
hearing
and
this
is
not
spelled
out
in
our
brief
and
that's
why
i
take
time
to
mention
it,
governor
heintzleman
in
alaska
--
of
alaska
talked
about
fishing
rights
before
congressional
committee
as
rights
which
were
exercised
for
a
long
time
under
used
on
occupation
by
the
indians.
he
used
the
term
fishing
rights
and
it
was
quite
clear
from
the
context
that
he
wasn't
talking
about
a
kind
of
right
that
you
have
to
--
have
a
deed
for
or
--
because
he
said
there
were
no
written
papers
indicating
what
fishing
had
been
done
by
these
indians
that
you
could
find
it
out
by
--
by
--
by
evidence
and
proof.
now,
all
these
we
think
really
add
up
to
the
fact
that
when
congress
used
the
word
fishing
rights,
it
used
in
the
sense
of
the
fishing
which
was
done
by
indians
as
indians.
now
of
course,
we
don't
claim
that
every
indian
in
alaska
is
controlled
by
the
federal
government
because
most
of
the
indians
in
alaska
who
do
fishing
are
not
under
aegis
of
the
federal
governments.
one
of
my
colleagues
pointed
out
to
me
if
an
indian,
who
happens
to
be
a
drugstore
(inaudible)
alaska
goes
out
fishing
on
sunday,
he
of
course
is
not
under
the
control
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
interior
department.
or
if
an
indian
happens
to
be
a
member
of
a
fishing
crew
in
some
other
part
of
alaska
but
he
is
not
fishing
as
indian.
an
indian
who
happens
to
be
fishing
in
alaska
and
the
--
the
indians
that
we
are
concerned
with
and
there,
the
only
ones
concerned
with
here
are
the
indians
who
has
special
treatment,
special
rights,
special
history
under
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
under
the
legislation
which
covers
as
enacted
for
the
metlakatla,
specifically
for
kake
and
angoon
under
the
wheeler-howard
act
as
it
was
applied
to
alaska
couple
of
years
later.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
they
are
--
no,
there
are
other
indian
fishing
rights
and
perhaps
i
should
make
that
clear
mr.
justice
douglas.
there
are
other
fishing
rights
which
are
not
involved
in
this
case,
which
involved
special
use
of
special
equipment
on
the
yukon
and
kuskokwim
rivers.
they
were
seal
fishing
in
the
--
of
the
pribilof
and
there
--
in
the
coquille
reservation,
they
have
a
right
to
use
bigger
kind
of
gear,
not
a
fish
trap
but
(voice
overlap)
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
not.
i
mean,
i
think
as
i've
indicated
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
without
taking
a
definitive
position
on
it
that
the
secretary
is
limited
to
the
kind
of
fishing
that
these
people
did.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
that
was
an
anti-conservation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
coming
season.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
1960
mr.
justice
brennan,
he
made
a
continuing
regulations.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
not
--
he
doesn't
do
it
year-by-year
anymore.
he
said
that
from
here
on
out,
they
can
fish
at
these
11
traps
unless
i,
otherwise
order,
so
that
continues
in
effect.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
with
due
deference
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
the
representation
of
the
attorney
general
of
alaska.
if
he
--
if
alaska
will
--
will
abide
by
the
decision
of
this
court
as
i'm
sure
it
will,
i
would
think
that
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
but
one
--
at
least,
i
checked
one
of
the
complaints.
i
did
not
have
the
time
to
check
the
others.
one
of
complaints
also
asked
for
declaratory
relief,
maybe
they
do.
in
any
case,
i
think
that
the
court
could
(inaudible)
an
injunction
against
the
governor
of
the
state
if
was
it
satisfied
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
that
if
the
court
should
decide
that
they
were
the
appellants'
issue
or
declaratory
judgment
or
order
the
lower
court,
i
presumed
that
the
state
of
alaska
would
abide
by
that
and
the
stay
could
be
dissolved.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
in
a
later
answer
to
a
similar
question
asked
by
another
justice,
i
qualified
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
said
that
i
thought
probably
the
secretary,
as
he's
done
with
respect
to
other
rights,
could
provide
that
fishing
rights,
if
he
wished
to
abolish
fish
traps,
he
could
say,
“they
shall
be
govern
by
the
alaska
regulations.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
has
done
in
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
alaska
would
have
no
jurisdiction
but
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
white
act
which
provides
for
fishing
by
anybody
in
--
in
contravention
of
the
authority
of
the
secretary
and
if
the
secretary
withdrew
the
permission
to
fish
--
to
use
these
fish
traps,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
white
act
which
has
very
severe
penalties,
i
think
severer
than
the
state
of
alaska.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
a
much
harder
question,
mr.
justice
--
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
yes
i
mean
to
answer,
i
mean
to
answer
but
i
just
want
to
indicate
that
in
my
view,
it's
a
much
harder
question
than
the
--
than
the
question
you
had
me
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
of
the
fact
that
congress
has
authorized
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
take
action
with
respect
to
kake
and
angoon.
that
is
in
the
wheeler-howard
act,
congress
authorized
him
to
foster
a
fishing
--
an
economy.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there's
nothing
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
but
they
didn't
limit
and
he
--
and
they
knew
when
--
certainly
when
they
extended
the
act
to
alaska
as
they
did
in,
and
i
think
in
1936,
that
fishing
was
the
major
occupation
which
the
indians
of
alaska
would
be
able
to
get
into,
that
was
a
major
one.
and
so,
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
mr.
justice
is
that
congress
did
authorize
him
to
take
this
action,
providing
canaries
and
to
give
money
and
so
therefore
that
this
is
not
something
at
large
or
something
which
even
the
indians
had
been
doing
on
their
own.
it's
something
authorized
by
congress
through
its
delegate,
the
secretary.
now,
to
get
back
to
your
other
question,
if
they
had
been
no
such
that
if
these
indians
had
been
just
fishing
with
fish
traps
because
the
secretary
had
allowed
them
along
with
all
the
others
to
fish
with
fish
traps.
i
think
that
question
would
be
whether
they
could
long
continued
use
an
occupation
of
these
particular
sites,
and
if
they
could
then
i
think
that
--
it
was
a
fishing.
i'm
not
certain
that
they
could,
but
i
mean
if
they
could
that
i
think
would
be
fishing
wholly
apart
from
the
authorization
given
by
congress
through
the
wheeler-howard
act
and
the
mechanism
that
it's
--
thank
you.
