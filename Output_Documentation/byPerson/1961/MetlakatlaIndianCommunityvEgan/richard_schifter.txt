mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
controversy
was
before
this
court,
was
before
at
the
1959
term,
at
that
time
on
appeal
from
the
interim
district
court
for
the
state
of
alaska.
this
court
noted
at
that
time
that
another
appeal
from
the
same
trial
court
decision
was
pending
in
the
alaska
supreme
court
and
ordered
appellants
to
pursue
their
remedies
in
the
alaska
supreme
court.
this
has
been
done.
the
alaska
supreme
court
has
affirmed
the
district
court
and
we
are
now
on
appeal
from
the
alaska
supreme
court.
as
we
return
to
this
court,
the
substantive
record
is
identical
with
the
one
that
was
before
the
court
in
1959.
what
has
been
added
is
the
opinion
of
the
alaska
supreme
court.
as
i
shall
try
to
point
out
later
on
with
regard
to
this
opinion,
the
opinion
of
the
alaska
supreme
court,
as
far
as
metlakatla
is
concerned,
the
state
of
alaska,
one
week
ago,
when
it
filed
its
brief
in
this
court,
stopped
defending
the
theory
of
law
on
which
the
alaska
supreme
court
decided
the
case
and
has
advanced
now
a
new
theory
for
the
first
time
in
this
litigation.
and
in
this
context,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
call
your
particular
attention
to
our
reply
brief,
which
is
now
addressed
to
the
alaska
--
to
the
state
of
alaska’s
new
theory
as
distinct
from
our
opening
brief
addressed
to
the
decision
below
which
is
no
longer
defended
by
the
state
of
alaska
as
far
as
metlakatla
is
concerned.
mr.
richard
schifter
the
green.
mr.
richard
schifter
the
green
brief.
i
filed
it
yesterday,
your
honor.
i
had
only
six
days
in
which
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
schifter
that
was
last
time
--
mr.
richard
schifter
three
years
ago.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
your
honor.
the
alaska
supreme
court
decided
this
case
on
--
by
holding
certain
federal
statutes
invalid
either
because
of
some
defect
in
them,
in
the
statute
itself
namely
the
1891
act
which
established
the
reservation,
the
presidential
proclamation
of
1916,
section
4
of
the
alaska
statehood
act
and
all
the
way
through
--
entered
as
unconstitutionality
of
the
statutes,
incidentally,
even
--
even
though
this
court
in
1918
sustained
the
1891
act.
the
alaska
--
state
of
alaska
under
the
new
theory
no
longer
challenges
the
constitutionality
or
validity
of
any
of
these
statutes
and
now
says
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
question
of
congressional
intent
as
i
understand
the
--
the
argument
when
congress
passed
section
4
of
the
alaska
statehood
act.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
is
much
narrower
now.
as
a
matter
fact,
the
way
the
alaska
supreme
court
decided
this
case
and
my
theory
of
it
is
that
alaska
might
go
back
wrapped
under
it
because
it
would
pull
out
the
reasons
for
federal
financial
support
to
indians
in
alaska.
the
way
the
alaska
supreme
court
decided
the
case,
conceivably
this
reservation,
the
metlakatla
reservation
no
longer
exists.
this
is
no
longer
suggested
by
the
state
of
alaska
and
as
a
matter
fact
in
their
brief
they
say
that
they
don't
have
to
go
as
far
as
the
alaska
supreme
court
did.
so
we
have
two
theories,
one
the
theory
of
the
alaska
supreme
court,
the
other
one
a
much
narrower
one.
mr.
richard
schifter
if
it
--
if
the
alaska
supreme
court
was
right
and
metlakatla
for
example
is
no
longer
a
federal
reserve,
to
be
quite
specific,
it
would
not
be
entitled
to
federal
assistance
for
school
as
it's
now
is
at
a
very
substantial
rate.
subs
--
there
are
not
heath
services
rendered
by
the
federal
government
to
natives
of
alaska.
the
constitutionality
of
any
kind
of
special
federal
aid
for
indians
or
natives
of
alaska
would
be
questioned
under
the
alaska
supreme
court
decision.
and
--
mr.
richard
schifter
i
wonder
whether
they
haven't
recognized
that,
yes,
your
honor.
the
basic
question
involved
here
is
the
fact
that
these
three
indian
fishing
communities
in
alaska
have
been
authorized
many
years
and
continued
to
be
authorized
by
the
secretary
of
interior
to
maintain
a
fishing
device
known
as
a
fish
trap.
the
state
of
alaska
has
attempted
to
outlaw
the
use
of
fish
traps
and
has
under
the
decision
of
the
alaska
supreme
court
now,
applied
that
statute
to
the
fish
traps
maintained
by
the
three
fishing
communities
involving
this
case,
metlakatla,
kake
and
angoon.
the
controversy
is
therefore
one
in
which
the
indian
communities
and
the
united
states
find
themselves
on
one
side
and
the
state
of
alaska
on
the
other.
there
is
a
distinct
difference
in
the
way
the
rights
of
metlakatla
on
one
hand
and
kake
and
angoon
were
arrived
at
and
for
the
rest
of
my
argument,
i
would
confine
myself
to
the
matter
in
which
metlakatla
derived
its
rights.
mr.
richard
schifter
which
statute,
your
honor,
the
1891?
mr.
richard
schifter
no,
to
everyone
--
to
everyone.
mr.
richard
schifter
only
these
three
maintain
fish
traps.
only
these
three
have
been
authorized
by
the
secretary
of
interior
to
maintain
fish
traps.
they're
all
together
and
only
11
fish
traps
involved,
four
for
metlakatla
and
seven
for
kake
and
angoon
combined.
metlakatla,
as
a
community,
was
first
organized
in
18
--
and
you
may
trace
the
background
of
it,
they're
first
organized
in
1887.
at
that
time,
the
annette
islands
were
completely
uninhabited.
the
metlakatla
group
was
invited
by
the
united
states
government
to
settle
on
the
annette
islands,
and
after
some
search,
did
select
this
particular
group
of
islands.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
assume
that
there
was
a
special
interest
at
that
time
in
attracting
stable
people
to
settle
in
the
general
area.
i'm
going
to
assume
that
this
was
--
mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
last
question
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
brennan
is
the
matter
which
i
would
like
to
discuss
a
little
bit
more
fully
than
i
did
yesterday.
the
background
relating
of
the
metlakatla
community
is
the
following.
the
tsimshian
indians
of
british
columbia
and
of
an
area
of
british
columbia
which
actually
spilled
over
in
the
southeast
alaska
had
been
the
recipients
--
or
a
group
of
them
had
been
the
recipients
of
the
benefits
of
a
missionary
by
the
name
of
william
duncan
in
the
second
half
of
the
19th
century.
mr.
duncan,
the
late
missionary,
had
organized
a
community
of
metlakatla
in
british
columbia,
but
had
run
into
difficulties
with
the
dominion
government
and
with
the
missionary
society
which
he
represented
and
had
led.
at
that
time,
dr.
henry
ward
beecher
and
other
outstanding
personalities
in
the
united
states
became
very
much
interested
in
the
matter
and
interested
president
grover
cleveland
in
the
situation
at
metlakatla.
father
duncan
came
to
washington
and
presented
his
case
--
his
problems
to
the
united
states
government
and
the
invitation
to
this
group
to
come
to
alaska
resulted
from
it.
as
indicated,
father
duncan,
with
a
group
of
members
of
the
metlakatla
indian
community
in
british
columbia
then
moved
--
and
moved
on
a
short
distance,
70
miles
to
southeast
alaska
and
established
the
community
on
the
annette
islands
reserve.
the
annette
islands
were
originally
set
aside
by
executive
action
but
because
a
question
as
to
legality
of
that
arose,
the
congress
in
1891
had
an
act
which
set
aside
the
annette
island
specifically
by
congressional
action
as
a
reservation,
as
a
united
states
reservation
for
the
metlakatla
indians
and
such
indians
as
may
join
them
later
which
incidentally
it
was
typical
language
for
a
good
number
of
indian
reservation
statutes
in
the
law
code
of
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
was
originally
--
i'm
not
certain
--
first
of
all
it
was
not
by
an
act
of
congress
initially.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
was
not
by
an
act
of
congress.
these
people
settled
in
1887,
four
years
prior
to
the
first
action
by
congress.
because
of
an
attorney
general's
opinion
which
raised
a
question
as
to
whether
all
of
these
can
be
done
by
executive
action,
congress
then
passed
this
1891
act.
the
--
as
far
as
this
1891
act
is
concerned
and
there
is
certain
language
in
it
that
is
absolutely
crucial
to
the
discussion
that
we
--
of
that
the
state
of
alaska,
well,
made
later
on,
the
language
of
the
act
specifically
provides
that
the
use
of
this
reservation
shall
be
subject
to
the
rules
and
regulations
and
restrictions
imposed
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
following
the
passage
of
1891
act,
this
community
developed
at
metlakatla.
father
duncan
was
extremely
active
in
strengthening
its
commercial
--
strengthening
the
economy
of
the
group.
he
got
this
indian
group
very
quickly
involved
in
commercial
fishing
which
just
began
around
the
1890s
as
a
commercial
fishing
exploitation
of
alaska.
it
was
started
there
and
this
particular
group
really
got
in
on
the
ground
floor
and
one
of
the
first
things
that
happened
and
this
was
in
the
1890s,
a
cannery
was
established
in
alaska
--
in
--
at
metlakatla
owned
by
the
community.
this
cannery
has
continued
in
existence
since
then
on
and
off,
it
burned
down
at
one
time
in
the
early
20th
century
and
was
rebuilt
and
has
--
un-interruptibly
in
existence
since,
i
believe,
around
1915
or
roughly
46
years.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes.
mr.
richard
schifter
your
honor,
the
--
the
actual
area
was
uninhabited.
i
believe
that
it
is
part
of
--
considered
part
of
the
aboriginal
area
of
the
haidas
which
is
--
or
the
tlingits
which
is
somewhat
different
from
the
tsimshians.
the
tsimshians
were
the
next-door
neighbors
--
mr.
richard
schifter
--
right
over
there.
the
--
as
i
indicated
the
cannery
became
one
of
the
key
elements
in
economic
development
of
the
community
and
this
is
really
is
of
great
significance
in
connection
with
the
fish
trap
situation.
the
fact
is,
that
fishing
alone
by
and
large
has
not
been
able
to
sus
--
to
sustain
a
village
or
any
community
in
alaska
on
an
economically
sound
basis.
the
reason
why
metlakatla
as
distinct
from
other
communities
has
been
able
to
develop
a
viable
economy
has
been
this
interaction
between
fishing
and
the
cannery.
this
cannery
has
always
been
owned
by
the
metlakatlans.
the
members
of
the
community
first
of
all
work
in
the
cannery
and
thereby,
the
community
is
therefore
--
the
income
from
fishing
is
supplemented
by
the
income
from
the
payroll
at
the
cannery.
and
furthermore,
its
profit
is
derived
from
cannery
and
this
is
really
the
most
substantial
benefit
of
this
fishing
economy,
the
profit
in
cannery
and
that
has
been
over
the
years
plowed
back
into
the
community
through
various
community
projects
which
the
community
engages
in
the
off
season.
in
other
words,
the
fishermen
are
then
employed
in
building
roads
and
doing
various
other
things
during
the
off
season
and
the
profit
of
the
cannery
is
used
in
this
manner
and
it
is
in
this
fashion
that
the
metlakatla
indian
community
as
distinct
from
some
other
fishing
communities
in
alaska
was
able
to
establish
a
viable
economy.
now,
one
of
the
--
mr.
richard
schifter
your
honor
i
--
it
relates
to
a
question
which
was
in
the
court's
opinion
in
to
the
1950
--
in
1959
term
namely
the
relevant
factors
of
a
--
concerning
--
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
trying
to
explain
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
made
the
secretary
--
i
believe
at
the
last
argument
justice
frankfurter
made
the
point
that
i
have
not
put
in
a
flesh
on
the
legal
bones
of
the
argument
and
i
wanted
to
--
mr.
richard
schifter
the
fact
that
the
united
states
government
was
aware
of
the
--
of
this
economic
problem
is
illustrated
then
by
the
specific
action
of
the
president,
president
wilson
in
1916,
in
spelling
out
the
boundaries
of
the
reserve
with
particular
reference
to
the
fishing
area.
and
the
specific
decision
that
was
made
in
by
the
president
in
1916
is
to
define
the
boundaries
as
extending
3000
feet
into
the
ocean.
this
was
an
exclusive
fishing
reserve
as
spelled
out
by
president
wilson's
proclamation
in
1916.
if
there
ever
was
any
question
as
to
the
president's
power
to
issue
this
proclamation,
it
was
later
addressed
--
addressed
in
1934
when
the
congress
passed
a
specific
statute
which
specifically
confirmed
previous
presidential
action
in
this
matter.
what
was,
therefore,
done
was
the
setting
aside
of
a
--
of
a
water
reservation
of
fifty-six-and-a-half
square
miles
subject
to
the
control
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
this
reservation
was
considered
by
this
court
in
the
alaska
pacific
fisheries
case
in
1918
and
it
was
at
that
time
confirmed.
it
was
also
mentioned
in
the
case
of
hynes
versus
grimes
by
the
supreme
court
in
1949
and
as
mr.
justice
douglas
raised
the
question
at
the
last
argument
concerning
hynes
versus
grimes,
i
just
want
to
emphasize
that
there
were
two
distinct
holdings
in
hynes
versus
grimes.
the
first
holding
was
that
and
that
was
in
connection
with
the
karluk
reservation
that
reservations
of
this
type
are
valid
that
they
may
be
established
and
this
particular
reservation
of
metlakatla
reservation
was
referred
to
in
the
decision
of
the
court
at
that
time.
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
criminal
sanctions
of
the
white
act
do
not
protect
such
a
reservation
that
this
second
holding
of
the
hynes
--
in
hynes
versus
grimes
has
no
real
bearing
on
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
first
holding,
namely
that
the
reservation
maybe
maintained
is
crucial.
since
hynes
versus
grimes,
the
congress
had
acted
in
two
ways
which
may
have
bearing
on
the
--
mr.
richard
schifter
i'm
not
suggesting
it
in
this
case
and
in
this
instance.
congress
has
acted
twice
since
hynes
versus
grimes.
in
the
first
instance,
it
amended
public
law
280
of
the
83rd
congress
which
was
discussed
yesterday
in
another
case
in
1958,
to
include
alaska
as
one
of
the
states
subject
to
the
state
jurisdiction.
but,
when
it
took
this
action,
one
has
to
note
that
the
public
law
280
specifically
provides
that
indians
are
not
to
be
deprived
of
right,
privileges
or
immunities
afforded
under
federal
statutes
with
respect
to
fishing
or
the
control,
licensing
and
regulation
thereon.
and
this
is
a
very
crucial
section
in
all
this
public
law
280
situation
that
is
that
with
regard
to
indian
reservations
that
are
covered
by
public
law
280,
hunting
and
fishing
is
maintained
under
federal
(voice
overlap)
in
the
case
maybe.
mr.
richard
schifter
i've
set
out
the
specific
section
in
our
replied
brief,
the
green
brief,
bottom
of
page
3,
going
over
to
page
4.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right,
bottom
of
page
3
and
continuing
to
page
4.
mr.
richard
schifter
the
amendment
was
in
1958
extending
it
to
alaska.
mr.
richard
schifter
1953
act.
mr.
richard
schifter
1958.
the
other
congressional
action
and
this
is
the
one
i
presume
the
state
bases
its
argument
on
or
at
least
it
hopes
that
this
is
the
time
when
the
state
actually
obtained
authority
to
move
in,
is
the
statehood
act.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
1891
act
says
that.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
statehood
act
and
specifically
to
section
4
of
the
statehood
act.
what
the
court
may
wish
to
note
is
that
there
are
two
distinct
clauses
in
this
statehood
--
in
section
4.
one
is,
a
disclaimer
by
the
state
of
alaska
as
to
any
right
and
title
to
native
properly
including
fishing
rights
and
then
second,
the
provision
--
mr.
richard
schifter
the
entire
--
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
about
the
same
time,
both
in
1958.
mr.
richard
schifter
a
few
days.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
preceded
but
bring
into
effect
later.
congress
adopted
the
statehood
act,
i
believe
a
few
weeks
prior
to
the
amendment
of
public
law
280,
but
public
280
immediately
went
into
effect
and
statehood
had
to
ratified
and
--
mr.
richard
schifter
section
4
of
the
statehood
act
your
honor
is
set
forth
in
our
grey
brief
pages
58,
59.
as
i
say,
there
are
two
distinct
clauses,
one
the
disclaim
of
right
and
title,
the
other
one
--
and
this
is
a
crucial
in
its
connection,
the
reservation
to
the
united
states
of
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
over
these
property
rights,
including
fishing
rights.
i
would
like
to
cite
the
--
i
would
like
to
cite
six
reasons
for
the
contention
that
the
phrase
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
united
states
supports
the
secretary
of
interior's
action
in
this
case
in
outlawing
--
in
refusing
to
admit
the
outlawing
of
fish
traps
on
the
metlakatla
reservation.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
believe
your
honor
is
also
in
the
--
in
the
other
--
in
the
clauses
in
the
other
statehood
act.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes.
the
--
first
of
all,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
words
themselves
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
indicate
the
power
that
the
united
states
intended
to
exercise.
second,
if
we
--
that
we
want
to
examine
the
omnibus
act
passed
by
congress
a
year
later,
in
1959,
to
correct
this
particular
section.
it
took
a
specific
step
to
reemphasize
the
meaning
of
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
as
far
as
reservation
--
as
far
as
reserving
rights
to
the
united
states
with
regard
to
indian
land
is
concerned
and
that
is
this.
section
4
as
initially
phrased
applied
both
to
indian
land
and
to
the
government's
own
land
--
u.s.
government
land.
when
congress
amended
the
statehood
act
through
the
omnibus
act
of
1959,
it
went
out
of
its
way
to
emphasize
that
the
phrase
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
shall
not
--
shall
not
apply
to
its
own
land,
but
only
to
indian
land.
mr.
richard
schifter
the
--
it's
on
page
47
of
the
main
brief,
the
grey
brief
and
the
legislative
history
is
explained
here
and
the
--
and
a
quotation
from
the
senate
report
and
the
house
report
it
says,
“this
is
to
make
clear
that
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
united
states
does
not
apply
generally
to
land
held
by
the
united
states
in
alaska,
but
only
land
and
property
held
by
natives
or
by
the
united
states
and
trust
of
natives.”
mr.
richard
schifter
right
and
title.
in
other
words,
as
far
as
public
domain
land
was
concerned,
the
united
states
made
it
clear
in
section
4
had
right
and
title
but
not
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
correct.
that's
the
way
i
understand
it
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
yes.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
was
the
very
reason
why
this
clarification
took
place
in
the
omnibus
act
to
make
--
make
certain
that
the
police
power
would
extend
over
the
--
over
united
states
land,
but
make
it
quite
clear
that
it
does
not
apply
to
the
up
--
to
these
rights
reserved
by
the
second
clause
of
section
--
mr.
richard
schifter
well
it
was
oversized--
mr.
richard
schifter
it
was
oversight
perhaps
your
honor
in
the
first
kind
of
was
drafted
and
being
too
all
inclusive
and
then
they
narrowed
it.
i've
also
set
forth
citations
from
the
legislative
reports
over
the
eight
years
which
indicated
very
clearly
the
intention
of
congress
to
reserve
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
over
these
fishing
rights
to
it.
the
problem
before
congress
as
explained
by
the
legislative
history
was
that
the
united
--
that
the
congress
did
not
want
to
see
itself
burdened
at
the
time,
it
was
legislating
with
regard
to
statehood
with
the
problem
of
indian
rights.
it
did
not
want
to
change
it
in
anyway
and
there
was
this
very
strong
insistence
by
the
congress
to
freeze
everything
regarding
indian
rights
in
status
quo
and
let
the
matter
of
indian
rights
be
determined
after
the
statehood
had
been
obtained.
advocates
of
statehood
at
the
same
time
recognized
go
well
that
if
they
did
get
themselves
embroiled
in
argument
over
indian
rights,
statehood
might
possibly
be
defeated
both
in
congress
and
possibly
in
the
state
itself.
as
far
as
action
in
congress
is
concerned,
we
have
quoted
in
particular
a
statement
by
senator
anderson
who
emphasized
that
the
members
of
the
committee
that
wrote
the
legislation
all
came
from
the
state
with
substantial
indian
populations
and
therefore
we're
aware
of
the
political
reality
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
in
making
sure
that
indian
rights
were
protected.
and
throughout
this
period,
there
was
a
strong
pro-indian
lobby
which
saw
it
that
section
4
was
in
no
way
weakened
and
we
have
a
citation
in
--
mr.
richard
schifter
of
alaska?
mr.
richard
schifter
the
figure
which
the
state
office
with
regard
to
fishermen
is
42%.
i
presume
it's
less
with
regards
to
others.
i
believe
there
about
30,000
to
35,000
natives
in
alaska
and
--
and
the
total
population
37,000
out
of
226,000.
mr.
richard
schifter
--
out
of
226,000.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
schifter
indian,
eskimos
and
aleuts
all
put
together
and
in
that
connection,
may
i
emphasize
that
we
claim
no
right
as
far
as
metakatla
is
concerned,
no
special
right
outside
the
reserve,
as
state
hasn't
briefed
occasionally,
suggested
that
we
might
be
claiming
rights
all
over.
we
do
not.
we
claim
only
within
these
fifty-six-and-a-half
square
miles.
finally
in
terms
of
statutory
interpretation,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior's
immediate
action
following
the
passage
of
the
statehood
act
in
promulgating
--
promulgating
regulations
which
specifically
authorized
the
use
of
fish
traps.
and
this
is
particularly
important
again
against
the
background
to
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
instrumental
in
the
drafting
of
not
only
the
statehood
act
but
particularly
section
4.
and
we
have
a
statement
by
senator
anderson
in
the
brief
emphasizing
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
his
representatives
react
–
they
participated
in
drafting
the
section
4.
so
there
in
the
department,
there
was
no
doubt
immediately
after
the
statehood
act
passed,
they
promulgated
regulations
which
permitted
the
operation
of
these
fish
traps.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
of
the
statehood
act
your
honor?
mr.
richard
schifter
no
i'm
not.
mr.
richard
schifter
oh,
6
(e)
i'm
sorry.
i
understood
16.
mr.
richard
schifter
6
(e),
yes.
that
referred
to
fishing
--
the
one
unique
feature
about
alaska
fishing
your
honor
was
that
both
indian
and
non-indian
fishing
was
under
the
control
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
under
section
6
(e),
the
sec
--
the
secretary
of
interior
transferred
to
the
new
state
control
over
non-indian
fishing.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes.
but
your
honor,
in
some
other
states
though,
the
territorial
government,
they
--
mr.
richard
schifter
there
was
some
self-government.
mr.
richard
schifter
and
but
not
with
regard
to
fishing.
fishing
was
handled
directly
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
that
--
mr.
richard
schifter
but
these
were
--
these
did
not
--
the
way
the
congress
always
made
it
clear
in
its
legislative
history
was
that
this
section
6
(e)
was
to
accept
indian
resources.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes.
i
just
want
to
emphasize
your
honor
that
the
legislative
history
makes
it
quite
clear
whenever
they
explained
section
6
(e)
and
its
--
and
its
connection
to
section
4
in
the
reports,
they
made
it
clear
that
there
is
a
transfer
of
all
fishing
rights
except
those
reserved
to
indian
and
the
specific
phrase
is
you
know,
our
green
brief
on
page
6
to
accept
from
transfer
to
the
state
those
fisheries
and
wildlife
which
are
included
within
the
reserve
of
native
right.
this
is
in
both
in
--
in
the
senate
report
in
1950.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right
sir.
mr.
richard
schifter
your
honor,
when
that
--
that's
correct
but
when
the
state
passed
that
law,
it
said
it
shall
not
be
construed
to
conflict
with
section
4.
now,
that
was
one
of
the
questions
which
was
still
open,
which
the
alaska
supreme
is
not
closed.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
the
basic
intention
of
congress
was
to
provide
through
a
transition
period.
mr.
richard
schifter
--
and
make
certain
though
that
after
that
period,
the
state
of
alaska
(voice
overlap)
responsibility.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
believe
it
--
mr.
richard
schifter
i
rather
assume
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
intention
was
to
permit
the
state
of
alaska
to
get
its
--
its
enforcement
apparatus
set
up.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
the
enforcement
apparatus
not
necessarily
regulations
but
the
enforcement
apparatus,
yes
that
the
people
are
ready
to
start
enforcing.
mr.
richard
schifter
as
far
as
enforcement
apparatus
is
concerned.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
believe
these
words
your
honor
do
mean
that
the
--
do
reflect
the
intention
of
congress
to
delay
only
until
the
secretary
of
the
state
of
alaska
is
able
to
--
to
carry
on
a
system
of
conservation.
i
do
not
think
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
have
the
secretary
of
--
of
the
interior
dictate
in
a
way
that
the
state
of
alaska
exactly
what
enforcement
--
what
enforcement
(inaudible)
to
pass
but
mainly
to
have
a
--
mr.
richard
schifter
westland,
westland
proviso.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
correct,
yeah.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes
and
of
state
of
washington.
mr.
richard
schifter
yeah,
that's
right.
