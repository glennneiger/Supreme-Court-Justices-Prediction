mr.
john
w.
cragun
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
here
for
the
organized
village
of
kake
and
the
angoon
community
association.
unlike
the
metlakatla
people
who
came
from
canada,
these
are
the
people
who
were
always
there.
the
court
acclaims
tells
us
in
a
suit
they
filed
there
that
they
have
been
there
since
time
immemorial
that
they
lived
by
fishing
and
that
they
traded
in
fish,
weighing
up
surplus
goods
was
an
important
feature
of
their
economy.
now,
these
people
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
that's
correct.
there
are
several
trap
sites
which
belong
to
kake
and
to
angoon
which
were
purchased
along
with
cannery
equipment
from
white
operators
in
1948
and
1950
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
no
sir.
the
only
thing
that
these
indians
can
point
to
is
that
they
have
always
been
fisherman.
they've
always
lived
in
this
area.
they're
in
their
aboriginal
area
and
they
only
have
the
protection
with
such
things
as
the
trading
with
russia
guaranteed
to
be
accorded
to
natives
in
their
own
property.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes.
it's
never
been
the
denounced
that
i
know
of.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes.
both
are
organized
under
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934
both
also
have
corporate
charters
in
accordance
with
section
16
and
17
of
that
act.
those
charters,
i
was
able
to
get
only
a
couple
of
--
a
copy
of
each,
were
handed
up
to
the
court
in
previous
argument
and
i
suppose
are
with
the
clerk.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
the
total
population
of
kake
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
to
be
400.
the
total
population
of
angoon
--
this
is
1959
that
this
complaint
was
filed,
there
maybe
some
change
since,
was
stated
to
be
306.
these
people
have
only
the
throb
left
of
their
original
rights,
which
represents
their
continuous
fishing.
white
people
have
been
in
there.
they
have
exploited
the
fisheries
and
the
indians
have
left
only
what
is
covered
by
the
secretary's
regulations.
now,
the
posture
of
this
case
comes
down
to
this.
alaska
says
that
its
statute,
in
spite
of
what
i
thought
were
pretty
plain
reservations,
prohibit
this
indian
trap
fishing.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
by
his
regulation
says
they're
entitled
to
fish
there
and
one
or
the
other
has
got
to
fall.
this
court
has
no
alternative
and
neither
to
say
section
4
of
a
statehood
act
which
says
that
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
these
indian
fishing
rights
shall
be
and
remain
with
the
united
states
until
dispose
by
it
is,
is
out,
it's
unconstitutional
because
as
alaska
says,
the
conflict
with
the
equal
footing
doctrine
or
for
some
of
the
other
reasons
i
guess
or
you
must
hold
that
those
alaska's
statutes
fall
before
the
federal
act
of
congress
reserving
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control.
the
fact
is
that
when
this
complaint
was
filed,
when
the
alaska
statehood
act
was
passed,
these
people
were
fishing
there
under
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
united
states
in
section
4
of
the
statehood
act
gave
to
the
new
state
the
power
and
jurisdiction
over
fishing
subject
to
they're
getting
regulatory
machinery
and
shape
under
section
6
(e)
which
had
been
adverted
to
and
then
they
said
that
excludes
indian
property
rights
including
fishing
rights
which
are
reserved
under
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
united
states.
i
submit
that
the
unites
states
have
the
power
to
make
that
provision
at
the
time
notwithstanding
the
state
court's
views
as
to
the
invalidity
of
section
4.
now
before
i
pass
on
to
whether
section
4
is
invalid,
i
would
like
to
associate
myself
with
something
i
was
sorry
mr.
schifter
didn't
get
to
deal
with
in
his
brief.
i
--
i
thought
it
was
quite
a
lended
credence
as
to
the
obvious
anxiety
with
which
matters
of
fish
traps
are
dealt
with
by
alaska
and
its
supreme
court.
you
will
find
better
hostility
in
this
long
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
towards
the
fish
trap.
mr.
schifter
has
documented
that
beautifully
in
his
brief.
the
fish
trap
in
alaska
is
hated
symbol
of
colonialism,
alaska
colonialism.
freight
operators
out
of
seattle
mostly
running
these
big
fish
traps,
recruiting
their
crews
in
alaska,
alaska
didn't
even
get
the
cigarette
money
that
that
the
crews
spent.
it
is
an
intense
emotional
issue
with
alaska
and
it
does
enable
us
to
understand
the
--
the
attitude
and
approach
of
state
officials
and
state
court.
now,
to
pass
that
because
it
is
fully
covered
and
fully
documented
by
mr.
schifter,
i
would
like
to
go
to
the
reasons
which
the
state
court
gives
in
this
lengthy
opinion
for
the
invalidity
of
section
4.
it's
--
section
4
has
got
to
fall,
it
reaches
the
point
directly.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
certainly.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
these
--
these
people
never
had
rights
outside
their
own
area
and
these
rights
are
within
that
extremely
limited
area.
it's
mapped
by
the
court
of
claims.
it's
in
the
federal
supplement.
i
regret
the
big
fold-out
map
that's
in
the
pamphlet
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims
sprightly
reduced
but
it
can
be
seen
with
a
magnifying
glass.
no,
they
have
no
rights
outside
their
aboriginal
area
and
they
have
no
rights
except
those
which
are
accorded
by
federal
regulation.
they
were
accorded
by
federal
regulation
at
the
time
the
statehood
act
was
passed
and
that
is
what
was
reserved
to
these
people
and
all
it's
reserved
to
the
notion
that
is
advanced
in
the
state
brief
that
somehow
rather
while
the
secretary
could
say,
“alright
fellows,
you
can
range
all
over
alaska”
is
i
think
reading
far
too
much
into
our
argument.
what
was
done
was
reserved
something
to
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
united
states
and
what
was
reserved
was
what
there
and
what
was
there
was
set
forth
in
federal
regulations
which
are
set
out
in
the
complaint.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
very
much
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
electronic
device.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
it's
within
his
area.
it's
the
old
problem
i
have
--
mr.
justice
van
devanter
had
a
phrase
for
it
in
the
--
i
believe
it
was
the
sandoval
case.
the
fact
that
a
combine
harvester
is
invented
neither
enlarges
nor
reduces
the
right
for
the
indian
in
his
land.
i
think
within
these
areas
which
are
set
out
by
federal
regulation,
they
can
fish
if
the
secretary
says
so
perhaps
only
with
a
hook
and
line
or
with
gillnets
or
purse
seines
or
traps
or
if
a
new
device
is
invented
electronically
beats
the
trap.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
cragun
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
believe
not
sir
and
here
is
the
reason.
there
were
nine
trap
sites
which
where
set
forth
in
the
federal
regulation
as
pertaining
to
kake
and
there
were
four
trap
sites
pertaining
to
angoon
when
the
statehood
act
was
passed.
now,
these
with
trap
sites,
you
might
say
which
were
bought
and
paid
for
by
the
indians
because
the
united
states
put
up
the
money
and
they
--
they
purchased
traps
and
canneries.
and
there
is,
as
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
says
a
moral
priority
to
the
owner
to
go
in
there.
now,
i
don't
think
the
--
the
secretary
can
take
that
and
give
back
to
other
indians.
i
don't
believe
it's
possible.
he
hasn't
permitted
kake
or
angoon
to
fish
all
of
those
trap
sites.
out
of
the
nine
trap
sites
which
he
had
authorized
when
he
left
some
big
fish
for
kake,
he's
permitted
only
four
to
be
fished.
out
of
the
four
for
angoon's,
he
has
permitted
only
three
to
be
fished,
but
i
think
that
marks
the
limits
on
it
and
i
don't
think
he
can
give
the
right
of
kake
and
angoon
a
way
the
other
indians
anymore
than
can
he
could
authorize
taking
angoon
to
go
to
other
indian
preserves
and
fish
them.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
an
indian
tribe,
of
course
this
is
quite
a
ways
away
from
my
case.
i
--
i
don't
want
to
argue
somebody
else
his
rights,
but
if
--
if
you
got
to
try
up
there
that
can
show
the
continuous
link
of
fishing,
i
suppose
under
the
reservation
of
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
over
that
right,
the
secretary
might
convert
to
a
trap.
i
would
assume
that
so,
it's
merely
in
another
way
of
fishing.
it
is
a
regulation
of
the
method
of
the
fishing
and
traps
are
far
more
satisfactory
from
a
conservations
standpoint
then
other
method
of
fishing
according
to
reputable
testimony
from
the
department
of
interior
before
congress.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
it's
set
forth
with
degrees
of
latitude
and
longitude
in
the
regulations
and
i
did
not
calculate
it.
i
regret
that
i
can't
give
the
--
i
don't
know
that
i
could
calculate
it.
i
didn't
have
it
calculated.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
believe
not
sir.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
these
are
set
forth
lying
between
so
many
degrees,
minutes
and
seconds
and
there
isn't
much
difference
in
the
seconds
and
i
don't
know
what
to
seconds
of
longitude
are
in
that
area.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
it's
perfectly
true
that
this
is
rationalized
by
the
supreme
court
of
alaska.
they
did
not
send
us
back
to
reopen
this.
i
would
have
been
prepared
to
put
competent
fish
biologists
on
to
prove
that
the
problem
is
how
many
fish
are
taken
and
how
well
they
are
handled
and
not
when
you
take
them
hook
and
line
or
by
some
dynamite
or
some
other
destructive
means.
the
traps
now
catch
only
an
infinite
testimonial
part
of
the
salmon
catch
in
alaska
because
they're
so
greatly
restricted.
there
state
brief
puts
in
as
its
final
appendix,
a
tabulation
showing
what's
happened
in
the
last
two
or
three
years
in
comparison
with
earlier
years
and
shows
us
way
done.
mr.
justice
douglas,
may
i
call
your
attention
to
the
talk
of
the
state
court,
at
the
bottom
of
page
5
(a)
and
running
the
6
(a)
of
its
opinion.
the
top
of
6
(a),
they
give
the
argument.
i
don't'
think
they
give
it
adequately
but
they
give
the
argument
of
the
proponents
of
fish
traps.
they
--
they
talk
on
both
sides
of
it,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
was
meant
to
do
more
than
claim
of
the
state
police
power
refers
to
the
regulation
of
fishing
which
i
think
we
would
all
agree.
they
haven't
squarely
put
this
on
a
conservation
basis.
they
give
him
both
sides
sir.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
sure.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
i
--
i
can't
do
better
than
accept
the
state's
--
it
comes.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
cannot
find
my
brief,
i
somehow
mislaid
it.
i
did
calculate
it.
this
is
not
the
one
on
which
i
had
calculated
but
it
runs
to
less
than
2%.
it's
practically
(inaudible)
even
with
an
outstanding
season
such
as
they
have
this
year.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
of
the
total
in
alaska,
yes.
it's
on
page
63
appendix
d
of
the
state's
brief.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
does
--
the
state
him
to
power
to
prohibit
traps.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
oh
yes,
i
think
he
does
because
he
has
the
regulation
and
control
of
the
indian
fishing.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
no.
i
think
that
unfortunately
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
they
can't
pin
it
on
the
constitution
so
ruled
in
the
tee-hit-ton
case.
they
have
an
aboriginal
right
which
is
a
true
right
and
a
legal
right
and
one
on
which
they
can
recover,
but
because
of
the
political
nature
of
that
right,
it
requires
further
action
of
congress
before
they
can
come
in
and
assert
it
against
the
united
sates.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
it
is
a
matter
of
grace.
it's
a
legal
right,
but
there
without
a
remedy
until
the
congress
gives
it.
congress
did
give
it
to
them
in
the
court
of
claim
case.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well
i
had
hoped
so.
i
have
had
a
one
--
well,
i
might
as
well
take
it
even
the
expensively
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
cragun
no,
i
haven't
more
important
point.
i
don't
suppose
that
neither
did
the
supreme
court
of
alaska.
supreme
court
of
alaska
says
that
this
statute
is
invalid,
section
4
reserving
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
united
states
is
invalid
because
it
violates
the
equal
footing
done.
now,
equal
footing
is
something
that
congress
accords
but
it
has
apparently
by
this
court
been
treated
as
on
the
level
of
a
constitutional
right
of
the
state
to
be
on
an
equal
footing
or
the
other
states.
but
this
court
has
repeatedly
sustained
reservations
of
indian
rights
and
indian
fishing
rights,
both
on
and
off
the
reservation
where
treaties
provided
for
off
reservation
rights
under
similar
reservations.
not
all
of
them
have
been
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
although
the
limits
referred
to
in
the
sandoval
case
was
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control,
the
very
words
we
have
here.
the
winans
case
i
think
is
the
--
probably
the
outstanding
example
of
what
i'm
talking
about.
there,
they
met
the
equal
footing
doctrine
squarely
and
they
met
shively
against
bowlby
which
is
also
relied
upon
by
the
state
supreme
court
which
held
that
tideland
that
passed
the
state
as
part
of
its
being
admitted
on
an
equal
footing.
the
(inaudible)
brothers
case,
dick
case,
ex
parte
webb
and
sandoval,
but
i
have
mentioned
two
or
three
times
are
further
examples
of
reservations
and
statehood
acts
like
this,
of
rights
to
the
indians
or
a
power
over
the
indians,
some
of
them
such
as
ex
parte
webb
is
reserving
a
power
over
the
indians
to
prohibit
the
introduction
of
liquor,
they
had
been
repeatedly
sustained
by
this
court
and
there
is
simply
nothing
to
the
equal
footing
point.
now,
i
think
the
other
ground
given
that
this
conflicts
with
the
state's
police
power.
federal
statute
must
give
way
before
the
police
power
has
been
plainly
ruled
on
by
this
court.
if
the
federal
government
has
power,
reservation
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
control
then
under
the
supremacy
clause
that
overrides
the
state
statute
and
i
take
it
therefore
that
there
is
no
basis
or
saying
that
it's
in
valid.
they
made
not
a
point.
they
say,
“well,
it's
any
factor.”
they
say
that
there's
a
distinction
between
in
the
statehood
act,
between
the
rights
of
indians
at
--
the
property
including
fishing
rights
of
indians
and
fishing
itself.
maybe
the
federal
government
has
power
to
regulate
fishing
rights,
but
here
what
these
people
are
doing
is
fishing
and
let
alaska
have
control
over
there.
it's
a
somatic
distinction
which
frankly
i
cannot
follow
and
i
believe
that
congress
did
not
commit
a
mere
meaningless
act
in
what
it
did.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
none
whatever,
there
never
been
treaties
with
alaskan
indians.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
it
has
been
set
forth
many
times.
the
greatest
length
or
list
of
the
source
of
power
was
given
in
the
kagama
case
by
this
court,
k-a-g-a-m-a.
it's
also
adverted
to
in
the
sandoval
case
to
which
i
have
referred
a
number
of
times,
but
fundamental
--
the
main
basis
in
the
commerce
clause
because
this
commerce
not
just
between
the
states
and
with
foreign
nations
but
with
the
indian
tribes
and
here,
you've
got
an
important
element
of
commerce.
that
alone
would
support
it
as
this
court
has
said
but
there
are
other
sources
of
power
to
particularly
the
power
in
international
affairs
to
deal
with
the
continent
people.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
may
it
please
the
court.
because
of
calculated
risk,
i
find
myself
with
more
things
to
respond
to
than
i
have
time,
but
i
would
like
to
answer
a
few
things.
one
questions
from
the
court,
mr.
justice
douglas,
taking
up
the
statement
from
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
that
a
fish
trap
catches
up
to
600,000
fish
whereas
a
seiner
takes
some
2,000
to
10,000,
comes
from
a
1918
opinion
of
this
court.
things
have
changed
since
then.
i
asked
the
manager
of
the
kake
cannery
about
it.
the
average
catch
of
a
trap
is
65,000.
the
average
catch
of
big
seiner
is
45,000
a
season.
maximum
possible
for
a
fish
trap
is
about
150,000
of
fish
and
for
a
big
seiner
about
75,000
fish.
this
is
not
the
‘big
against
the
small'
anymore.
it
might
have
been
at
one
time.
with
respect
to
the
argument
of
alaska,
i
take
it
that
the
--
yes,
the
federal
government
does
have
powers
in
indian
affairs
to
grant
them
money.
i
should
say
that
mr.
schifter's
client,
metlakatla,
gets
aid
from
the
federal
government
for
indian
schools
under
the
impacted
areas
statute,
he
has
quoted
the
letter
in
the
appendix
to
his
brief,
on
the
ground
that
these
are
indians.
this
is
a
federal
area.
the
state
comes
in,
wants
money
on
that
ground
because
this
is
an
exclusive
problem
under
federal
government.
with
regard
to
kake
and
angoon,
they
got
money
under
a
different
act,
the
johnson-o'malley
act
which
applies
solely
and
exclusively
to
indians
so
that
in
both
cases,
they
are
getting
money
from
the
federal
government
because
these
are
indians
in
indian
community.
mr.
gross
thought
that
the
right
to
use
fish
traps
was
not
given
to
the
indians.
it
was
given
to
just
anybody,
but
if
we
take
that
shore,
both
whites
and
indians
have
the
right
to
use
fish
traps
if
they
have
the
wherewithal
to
do
it,
and
the
indians
ordinarily
didn't
until
congress
have
told
them,
the
united
states
bought
these
few
traps
for
them.
they
were
using
them
as
the
matter
of
right.
when
statehood
came,
what
they
were
using
was
not
wrongful
at
all.
it's
more
than
--
i
was
thinking
last
night,
i
should
have
thought
of
it
earlier,
professor
(inaudible)
in
his
lecture
on
fundamental
legal
conceptions
said
that
a
bare
oral
license
to
walkover
blackacre
is
an
interesting
land.
it's
a
right.
he
uses
it
as
an
example
of
a
right
in
land.
now,
here,
these
indians
have
a
right
in
the
use
of
those
fish
traps,
and
the
united
states
said
that
it
reserved
to
itself
the
exclusive
--
no,
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
until
disposed
of
by
congress.
many
of
the
other
arguments
i
take
to
be
ad
hominem,
about
how
difficult
it
would
be
for
alaska
to
reduce
--
regulating
here
if
a
number
of
fishermen
are
not
subject
to
its
jurisdiction.
but
that
is
not
an
argument
to
make
to
this
court,
but
they
should
go
to
congress
with
that
and
ask
congress
to
terminate
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
which
congress
retained
that
--
with
the
consent
of
the
state.
the
form
that
i've
attempted
to
go
into
this
question
of
what
aboriginal
rights
there
are,
i'd
like
to
say
that
kake
is
a
tribe
so
as
angoon.
they
are
tribes
of
tlingit
indians
who
were
a
very
closely
related
people,
but
kake
and
angoon
are
just
little
islands
in
this
whole
southeast
alaska.
we
do
not
assert,
and
i
take
it,
we
could
not
assert
that
we
could
go
over
all
tlingit
territory
simply
because
we
are
members
of
the
larger
tlingit
ethnography.
we
are
kake
--
the
kake
tribe
was
so
described
in
this
charter
which
was
obtained
from
the
united
states.
the
kake,
a
tribe
of
indians
back
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes,
it's
correct
that
kake
and
angoon
have
brought
an
action,
a
suit
to
the
court
of
claims,
and
have
been
impelled
and
entitled
to
recover
for
the
taking
of
all
their
aboriginal
rights,
but
that's
only
as
part
of
the
tlingit
group.
congress
authorizes
by
the
tlingit
and
the
ida
the
overall
of
groups
and
the
overwhelming
bulk
of
their
land
was
taken
not
later
than
the
time
of
the
establishment
of
the
congress
national
(inaudible),
so
the
court
of
claims
held.
and
with
that,
of
course,
vanished
their
rights
to
the
over
overwhelming
bulk
of
their
aboriginal
lands.
kake
is
a
little
village,
it's
got
a
little
property.
angoon
has
a
little
village.
they
are
aboriginal
sites,
it's
all
that's
left,
together
with
their
fish
traps
of
what
once
was
a
very
vast
aboriginal
holding.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes,
to
the
extent
that
white
people
took
over
the
fishing
rights
that
have
been
exclusively
those
of
the
tlingit
and
haida
indians.
the
claim
did
embrace
them
and
it
was
found
that
white
people
had
with
the
permission
of
congress
taken
them,
that
they
have
lost
their
--
their
exclusive
right
of
fisheries
in
the
whole
southeast
of
alaska.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
i
think
we
can
get
compensation
for
what
we
lost.
we
can
get
for
no
more
than
what
we
have
lost.
i
say
that
here,
there
is
a
thread
which
never
has
been
lost.
it's
trifling
by
the
side
of
our
aboriginal
right,
trifling
indeed.
it's
merely
of
thread
left
of
what
once
was
the
vast
fishery
that
has
been
taken
from
the
exclusive
use
and
control
of
tlingit
indians.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
the
thread
is
a
pitiful
11
fish
traps
out
of
their
whole
vast
southeast
alaskan
exclusive
use
and
occupancy
when
the
white
men
arrived.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
the
court
of
claims
we
sued
--
i
say
we,
i'm
not
the
attorney
in
that
case,
the
tlingit
indians
--
the
tlingit
and
haida
indians
sued
for
what
was
lost
and
that,
at
least,
is
the
overwhelming
--
they
claim
that
everything
was
lost.
the
court
of
claims
did
say
that
they
have
lost
their
valuable
right
of
fisheries.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
but
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
these
seven
fish
traps,
its
seven
not
11
and
i
erroneously
mentioned
that
these
seven
fish
traps
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
claims,
they
are
really
de
minimis
in
the
terms
of
the
overall
aboriginal
picture.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
the
--
not
officially
published
this
yet.
it's
--
appears
in
federal
supplement
--
177
federal
supplement
452.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
the
tlingit.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes
it's
a
tribal
both
claim
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
or
it's
like
a
tribal
claim.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
they
--
the
point
i
believe
that
which
have
been
made
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
is
that
if
you
lost
clearly
you
didn't
have
anything
here
for
congress
to
retain
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
over.
am
i
misreading
your
honor's
question?
mr.
john
w.
cragun
oh,
no,
it
hasn't
gone
to
final
judgment
and
when
they
get
to
(inaudible)
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
department
of
justice,
mr.
davis'
colleague
will
come
in
and
say,
“ah,
but
here
is
a
little
that
you
didn't
lose
and
we're
not
going
to
pay
for
it.”
