mr.

chief
justice
earl

may
i
ask
you,
how
about
the
invitational
was
extended,
was
the
--
extended
by
the
president
or
was
it
through
an
act
of
congress?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
not
by--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
interrupt
just
once
more
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
question
is
prompted
by
the
fact
you
said
they
came
from
so
close
a
distance
from
canada,
70
miles
as
i
understand
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
say,
i'm
wondering
if
in
this
land
they
were
brought
to,
and
this
reservation
was
a
part
of
their
ancient
lands
that
they
roamed
or
used
or
in
some
other
manner
occupied?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cragun.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cragun,
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
this
question.
if
you
prevail,
is
there
any
territorial
limit
at
all
to
the
right
of
your
people
to
establish
these
fish
traps?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
that
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
approximate
size
of
this
area,
of
this
land
in
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
a
great
area?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
then
as
i
understand
mr.
davis,
so
far
as
the
metlakatla
indians
are
concerned
their
fishing
trap
rights
or
rather
rights
are
limited
to
the
reservations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
the
--
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
kake,
as
to
their
ancient
lands,
whatever
those
ancient
lands
might
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
cannot
go
beyond
those
territorial
limits.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
i
have
one
question.
i
understood
you
say
to
say
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
--
that
even
if
it
was
decided
not
to
have
these
traps
that
under
circumstances
would
the
state
have
any
criminal
jurisdiction
over
these
fishing
rights.
now,
did
you
make
any
distinction
between
is
because
of
their
different
situations
between
the
kake
group
and
the
other
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
in
the
absence
of
--
in
the
absence
of
some
set
regulations
by
the
--
the
secretary,
alaska
would
have
no
jurisdiction,
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
one
other
question.
did
i
understand
counsel
correctly
that
these
fish
traps
amount
to
only
about
2%?
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
moody.
chief
justice
earl
warren
motion
will
be
granted,
mr.
gross?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
anyone
else
could
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
what
congress
intended
in
that
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
because
the
attorney
general
is
to
argue
the
other
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gross,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
large
are
they,
mr.
gross?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
fish
wheels.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
they
are
rather
larger,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
no,
no,
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
take
millions
of
them
just
for
subsistence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
millions,
literally
millions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
--
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
moody.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
your
legislature
formally
accepted
jurisdiction
under
the
1953
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cragun.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
