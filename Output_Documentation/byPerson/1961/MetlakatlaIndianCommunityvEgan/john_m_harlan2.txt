m.

where
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
put
that
question
to
you
in
no
difference
form?
supposing
a
new
tribe
of
indians
moved
in
with
the
territory
that
you're
talking
about
which
were
subject
to
the
permissive
authority
given
by
the
secretary
of
interior,
would
that
be
under
the
statehood
act
reser
--
the
protection
under
reservation
clause?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
he
create
some
more
traps,
some
more
trap
rights
that
were
given
to
a
new
indian
tribe
that
might
move
in
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down
on
your
broad
judicial
(inaudible).
assuming
that
there'd
been
no
wheeler-howard
act,
no
action
by
the
interior
with
respect
to
kakes
and
angoons,
would
you
still
say
--
would
you
still
argue
that
their
rights
are
protected
on
restriction
for
the
state
of
alaska?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
question
i
want
to
put
to
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
becomes
is
harder
in
alaska,
because
of
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
economy,
no
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
nothing
else.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
are
talking
in
all
this
here,
limiting
yourself
to
the
case,
angoon?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
--
your
position
i
gather
under
section
4
is
that
the
only
effect
of
it
was
to
prevent
alaska
from
giving
fishing
rights
in
the
metlakatlans
--
metlakatlan
territory
to
anybody
except
metlakatlan.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
citation,
the
court
of
claims
opinion
(inaudible)?
