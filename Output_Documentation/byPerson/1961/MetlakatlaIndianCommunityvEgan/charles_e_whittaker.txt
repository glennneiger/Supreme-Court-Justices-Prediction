congress
might
be
able
to
change
it
but
presently,
they
do
have
some
fixed
vessel
rights,
wouldn't
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
mr.
solicitor,
vested
on
not
against
the
united
states,
it's
part
of
the
larger
problem
of
indian
rights
against
him
(voice
overlap)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
that
done
to
the
metlakatla
also?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
right
hand
upon
the
fact
that
it
was
an
indian
community
or
ban
this
specific
grant
to
produce
in
proclamation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
whether
he
could
not
(inaudible)
premises
right
with
reference
to
have
adopted
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please
sir?
did
that
provision
of
the
white
act
have
any
effect
to
cancel
the
earlier
1916
grant
of
exclusive
fishing
rights
in
these
thousand
foot
--
300,000
feet
kilometer
(inaudible)
and
metlakatla?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
white
act
was
passed
in
1924.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
grant
to
the
metlakatla
since
1916?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
one
more
thing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
would
mean
indian
fishing
rights
as
to
--
within
the
terms
on
section
4?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
not
the
source
of
the
policy.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
when
you
right
in
that
sense,
if
i
may
--
you're
just
--
you're
treating
with
a
right
as
a
special
individual
property
right,
are
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
mean
something
different
than
the
right
of
every
citizen
as
a
citizen?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
act
if
i
recall
it
says
that
(inaudible)
absolute
jurisdiction
as
control.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
of
them.
all
lands
and
property,
(inaudible)
including
fishing
right,
all
lands
and
other
possible
inferences
including
fishing
rights
held
by
native
or
by
the
united
states
for
them.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
fishing
rights
in
that
kind
of
(inaudible)
have
some
relationship
to
lands
or
other
property,
doesn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
taken
by
what?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
pertinence.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
--
that
depends
on
the
(inaudible)
rights,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
see
if
i
understood
you
in
that
opinion
you
made.
is
that
the
(inaudible)
does
not
distinguish
by
the
white
act
(inaudible)
that
still
exists?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
position
(inaudible)
is
taking
on
the
point?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
right
to
regulate
depends
on
what,
section
4
of
the
statehood
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
if
the
language
reserved
(inaudible)
absolute
control
over
the
jurisdictions
(inaudible)
over
the
land
of
other
property
including
fishing
rights
done
by
angoons,
then
that
wouldn't
leave,
does
it,
any
power
at
all
to
have
jurisdiction
(inaudible)
on
the
part
of
alaskans?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
you
were
talking
only
however
about
metlakatla
now
and
not
this
indian
fishing,
but
fishing
rights
in
the
sense
of
comity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
there
any
dispute
here
between
the
parties
of
that
matter
is
exclusively
within
state
jurisdiction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
is
not
the
third
party
that
you
mentioned
about?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wonder
if
you
would
just
suggest,
how
congress
could
more
(inaudible)
expressed
its
will
than
to
say
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
is
reserved?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
–
whatever
the
rights
are
that
made
it
–
and
this
is
a
question
about
(inaudible)
but
whatever
they
are,
they
are
reserved
exclusively
to
the
united
states?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
they
are,
alaska
has
no
power
over
them,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then
we
get
down
to
a
question
of
always
as
to
what
is
meant
by
fishing
rights
in
the
context
used
by
congress
in
section
4?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
cragun,
i
think
that
the
time
you
have
is
little,
but
i
would
like
to
have
you
tell
us
whether
i
correctly
understood
mr.
gross'
dissent
that
these
rights
are
kake
and
angoon
had
been
sued
for,
the
taking
of
them,
and
the
judgment
had
been
recovered
in
the
court
of
claims,
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
did
the
claim
advanced
in
the
court
of
claims
embrace
the
same
rights
as
here
reasserted
by
kake
and
angoon?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
i
would
be
interested
to
hear
you
say
how
you
can
have
compensation
for
that
right
to
the
court
of
claims
and
yet
rely
on
it
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
is
that
thread?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
was
embraced
as
i
understood
you,
i
maybe
misunderstood
you,
in
the
claim
you've
made
for
the
court
of
claims.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
that
mean
--
