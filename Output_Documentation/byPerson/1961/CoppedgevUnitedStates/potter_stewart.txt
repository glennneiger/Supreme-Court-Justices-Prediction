justice
potter
stewart
well
the
fact
the
matter
is,
mr.
boskey,
as
i
think
you
point
out
in
your
brief
that
in
the
--
in
the
ordinary
procedure
in
--
in
appeals
in
which
the
case
has
been
made,
the
court
has
no
occasion.
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
occasion
to
consider
whether
it
not
that
appeal
is
frivolous
until
it
is
set
for
argument.
it's
a
very
rare
case,
is
it
not
in
which
the
appellee
would
move
--
move
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
the
appeal
was
frivolous
--
justice
potter
stewart
rarely,
it
has
the
exhaustive
property
in
the
--
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events.
the
court
doesn't
have
any
occasion
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
appeal
is
frivolous
until
it
is
set
and
until
the
arguments
heard.
and
in
that
case,
what
the
court
often
does
instead
of
dismissing
it
who
agree
to
affirm
it
but
with
the
briefest
kind
of
a
per
curiam
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
general
manner
of
doing
business
in
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
--
this
was
an
offense
of
the
character
that
could
be
prosecuted
only
by
indictment
rather
than
information.
justice
potter
stewart
submission
--
submission
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
after
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
all
i
got
to
do
with
this.
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
a
habeas
corpus
or
2255
proceeding
where
something
might
turn
on
whether
or
not
he
is
serving
the
sentence
which
he
is
now.
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
see
your
point.
you're
arguing
to
the
--
the
fact
that
there
is
no
great
urgency
in
this
case
and
that
i
suppose,
therefore,
that
if
we
decide
that
a
part
of
this
case
to
mr.
boskey's
favor,
we
should
deal
no
great
compulsion
to
decide
the
merits
as
against
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
remanding
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
the
merits
because
in
the
meantime,
this
fellow
is
serving
about
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
this
180
were
--
were
denied
by
the
district
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
denied
by
the
district
courts
and
that
--
that
denial
by
the
district
courts,
he
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
out
of
180,
the
court
of
appeals
obviously
granted
a
sizeable
number
but
not
all.
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
some
43
were
direct
appeals
of
criminal
conviction
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
can't
be
denied
by
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
right
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
had
been
denied
by
the
district
court
and
then
what
was
the
fate
of
these
43
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
we're
concerned
here,
in
this
case,
only
with
the
problem
which
arises
when
the
district
court
does
deny
the
right
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let
see
if
i
get.
what
you're
telling
is
that
in
fact
there
has
been
103,
60
plus
43
direct
appeal
applications
were
made
from
the
district
court
were
lead
to
appeal.
in
60,
this
leave
would
granted
and
43
had
been
denied.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
only
in
direct
appeal
and
that
--
how
would
you
mind
--
i
think
you
suggest
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i'm
--
answer
to
me.
now
you
said
that
there's
no
relevancy
as
the
collateral
is
(inaudible)
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
sorry.
i
missed
that
figure.
how
many
a
year?
how
many
each
year?
justice
potter
stewart
convictions
in
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
potter
stewart
are
all
these
362
its
convictions
after
not
guilty
pleas?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
a
--
convictions
based
on
guilty
pleads
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
the
very
point
that
mr.
bazelon
makes
is
that
you
don't
have
this
(inaudible)
efficient
streamline
procedure
in
the
case
of
appellants
who
can
afford
to
pay
the
fee.
