justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
this
one
thing
that
these
figures,
mr.
boskey
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
alaska
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
know.
i'd
still
don't
want.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
secondary
sources
are
good
enough
for
me,
but
what
is
it?
april
1961?
justice
john
m.
harlan
at
minimum
security?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
was
once
a
codefendant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
point
is
that
taken
to
judge
holtzoff
though
he
was
betided
from
searching
his
own
mind
to
see
whether
he
prioritized
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
hope
you
always
devote
sometime
at
the
question
that
you
raised
in
your
brief
mainly
assuming
that
these
questions
are
not
frivolous
whether
what
was
done
here
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
an
adequate
substantive
record
that
would
raise
appeal.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
in
connection
with
that,
i
wish
to
deal
with
the
lurk
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
good.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
the
memoran
--
the
memorandum
that
he
--
or
the
briefs
that
he
filed
in
support
of
his
application
--
informal
application
here
in
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
how
was
the
procedure
here
different
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
difference?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
is
there
--
the
lurk
case,
decided
in
what
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
lurk
case,
as
a
fact,
the
(inaudible)
consideration
of
the
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
for
some
instance
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
going
back
to
your
first
position,
is
this
the
fair
statement
of
what
it
is
that
--
we
should
look
at
this
as
if
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
final
submission
of
this
matter
on
the
briefs
had
said,
“motion
for
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
granted
in
view
of
the
extensive
briefing
that
this
case
has
received
we
find
that
oral
argument
as
unnecessary
and
therefore
the
case
need
be
docketed,
the
appeal
is
dismissed
or
the
appeal
is
affirmed.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
essence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
more
question
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice's
permission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
you
have
been
advised
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
were
treating
this
application
in
a
way
the
government
says
that
they
affect
(inaudible),
apart
from
any
protest
that
you
might
have
had
that
you
are
being
deprived
with
that
course
of
procedure
of
oral
argument,
was
there
anything
more
that
you
would
have
wished
to
submit
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
way
of
briefs
or
authorities
than
what
you
had
submitted?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
stated
in
your
memorandum?
