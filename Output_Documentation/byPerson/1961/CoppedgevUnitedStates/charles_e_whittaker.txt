all
were
denied
but
the
court

appeals?
justice
charles

whittaker
(inaudible)
was
granted
in
the
court

appeals?
justice
charles

whittaker
mr.
boskey,
would
not
this
matter
be
more
constantly
handle
simply
by
the
dismissing
of
the
case
on
its
appearance
on
the
testimony
brought
back
rather
than
to
permit
disruption
of
an
indictment
simply
because
the
witness
before
the
grand
jury
recaps?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
wonder
that
quite
very
statement
of
judge
holtzoff.
didn't
he
say,
“here,
we
tried
cases
for
them”?
and
if
this
evidence
continuation
of
the
court
in
full,
we
don't
apply
cases
just
direct.
didn't
what
he
meant
was?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
what
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
belcher.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask,
what
if
(inaudible)

charles

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
kind
of
a
statement
would
be
admissible.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
can
see
how
it
would
be
a
ground
for
a
motion
to
continue
the
case
to
give
an
opportunity
to
take
this
man's
deposition
where
both
sides
would
have
an
opportunity
to
examine
it.
but
could
it
be,
assuming
even
that
it's
later
than
his
original
testimony
on
the
first
trial,
could
it
be
competent
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
because
if
that
were
competent,
then
all
one
would
have
to
do
to
render
incompetent,
prior
trial
testimony
would
be
to
get
a
statement
of
the
witness
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
let's
see
if
i
understand,
is
that
to
say
that
a
judge
who
was
trying
a
case
the
second
time
is
under
a
duty
when
testimony
of
the
witness
is
being
read
on
the
second
trial,
is
under
a
duty
to
give
to
the
jury
his
impression
of
the
witness
who
had
testified
in
the
former
trial?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
that's
applicable
to
this
situation
for
(inaudible)
simply
ex
parte,
awkward
for
receiving
evidence
a
signed
statement
to
impeach
the
testimony
given
in
a
former
trial?
