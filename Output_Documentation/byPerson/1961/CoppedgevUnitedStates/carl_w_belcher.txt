mr.
carl
w.
belcher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
does
indeed
characterize
these
arguments
as
frivolous
but
it
does
not
do
so
in
any
personal
sense.
we
perhaps
has
do
not
need
any
personal
slur
on
this
opponent.
we
are
simply
using
the
term
which
this
court
has
itself
imposed
as
the
legal
standard
in
the
ellis
case.
i
am
pleased
to
note
that
my
opponent
does
not
slur
me
or
the
system
that
is
invoked
here
because
he
does
not
accuse
us
upstanding
path
since
the
ellis
case.
he
does
not
say
that
there
has
been
no
effect
or
no
reaction
as
a
result
to
the
ellis
case
but
he
does
of
course
say
is
that
there
has
been
a
change
and
in
proceeds
to
argue
to
the
effect
that
these
changes
meaningless
or
at
least
it
does
not
handle
the
problem.
i'm
also
pleased
to
note
that
he
conceives
that
there
is
no
simple
solution
to
the
problem.
the
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia,
as
the
courts
everywhere
--
federal
courts
do
have
this
problem
that
was
alluded
to
in
the
last
few
minutes
that
the
statute
passed
by
congress
is
there
and
must
be
given
difference.
and
of
course,
the
opinions
of
this
court
must
also
be
given
difference.
and
it
place
the
court
--
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
the
state
from
the
other
federal
courts
have
their
own
special
problem
because
of
certain
figures
and
statistics,
which
i
hope
to
bring
to
your
attention
in
a
moment.
the
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
has
attempted
to
solve
these
problems
as
who
made
those
attempts
since
the
ellis
case.
and
this
system,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
i
prefer
it
not
call
it
system,
this
manner
of
handling
cases
is
an
honest
attempt
to
handle
this
problem.
and
may
it
please
your
honors
as
counsel
for
the
government
to
some
10
years
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
had
tried
to
make
it
work
honestly
not
on
the
basis
of
an
indigent
si
--
situation
but
also
in
non-indigent.
we
have
attempted
to
make
the
calendar
in
the
court
of
appeals
a
robust
calendar
because
the
non-indigent,
the
wealthy
are
attached
by
counsel
for
the
appellee
with
motions
to
dismiss,
with
motions
to
affirm,
with
motions
that
the
court
orders
a
given
party
to
show
cause
why
the
rules
of
the
court
have
not
been
followed
and
in
every
instances
in
which
rule
75
of
the
civil
rules
requires
a
concise
statement
of
the
points
which
are
being
brought
forward
on
appeal.
that
concise
statement
is
screened
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
if
the
issues
to
be
raised
by
the
appellant
can
be
delineated
so
that
a
motion
to
affirm
or
dismiss
can
be
formulated.
and
if
that's
possible,
a
motion
is
found.
now,
as
to
this
petitioner,
we
need
to
consider
him.
at
the
moment,
he
is
in
lorton
as
counsel
had
said.
he's
serving
two
sentences.
the
one
in
this
case
is
consecutive
and
depend
upon
a
prior
sentence
in
another
case
and
an
assault
of
a
dangerous
weapon
conviction.
and
in
that
prior
case,
he
was
sentenced
to
two
to
seven
years.
that
seven
years
has
not
expired.
in
the
present
case,
he
was
sentenced
to
serve
20
months
to
5
years.
and
the
combination,
the
way
they
are
treated
is
that
he
has
a
minimum
sentence
of
two
years
and
20
years
--
20
months
as
a
minimum,
almost
three
years
is
the
minimum,
and
a
maximum
of
12
years.
he
is
now,
at
the
moment,
is
eligible
for
parole.
he
has
not
applied
for
parole.
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
consider
this
individual
for
parole.
when
he
does
apply,
he
will
certainly
be
considered
in
the
normal
processes.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i
only
--
only
bring
that
up
your
honor
because
it
is
has
been
referred
to
by
counsel.
and
i
point
out
that
during
the
times,
this
court
considers
what
i
--
i
think
is
a
serious
problem
that
counsel
agrees
with
it.
you
do
not
have
an
individual
who
is
waiting
at
the
door
to
walk
out.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
and
my
main
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
a
proper
sentence.
he
has
--
he's
now
serving
a
sentence
on
another
case
entirely
separate
from
this
case
and
the
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i
believe
that
under
the
system
that
--
is
being
utilized,
he
is
not.
there
is
some
conflict
between
counsel.
my
information
comes
from
the
bureau
of
prisons.
it
is
to
the
indrawn
effect
that
this
petitioner
is
now
eligible
to
apply
for
parole.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
under
a
merger
of
the
two
sentences,
the
way
they
are
treated
considering
both.he
is
eligible
to
apply
for
parole.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
i
simply
say
your
honor
that
he
has
not
applied
for
parole.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no
sir,
because
his
sentence
in
the
first
case
is
a
seven
year
maximum.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
his
sentence
in
the
first
case
was
a
seven
year
maximum
and
he
perhaps
to
serve
this
good
time
on
the
minimum
sentence
which
is
some
two
years.
if
he
applies
for
parole,
it
is
possible
and
he
be
considered
favorably
and
would
be
great.
but
as
far
as
a
mirror
mechanical
running
of
time,
this
man
has
a
long
way
to
go.
on
the
other
case,
not
just
this
case
but
not
on
the
other
case,
so
that
the
thing
which
is
keeping
him
where
he
is
now,
the
first
barrier
is,
his
application
in
consideration
for
parole.
he
can
do
it.
it
maybe
considered
favorably
but
so
far,
he
has
not
even
applied.
my
major
point
in
bringing
that
up
that
all
was
simply
that,
irregardless
of
whether
or
not
it
is
felt
that
one
more
of
these
issues
which
the
government
frivolous
within
the
legal
standard
of
ellis
are
considered
to
this
court
to
be
not
frivolous.
there
is
still
is
a
system
of
--
i
don't
like
the
word
of
--
but
a
method
which
is
a
serious
attempt
to
work
out
a
very
serious
problem
so
that
even
if
that
issue
is
to
cause
a
remand
to
this
case,
it
is
requested
and
is
possible
that
this
--
the
method
can
itself
be
considered
substantively
by
the
court
in
separate
report.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
great.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
we
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
even
if
you
would
have
proceed
to
say
that
the
method
is
a
reasonable
method
for
the
local
situation
in
the
district
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that
is
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
your
honor,
the
particular
points
are
involved
in
this
case.
they're
part
of
the
case.
they
do
have
to
be
praised
as
against
the
ellis
standard
or
standard
of
testing
against
the
motion
to
affirm
or
dismiss.
they
do
have
to
be
tested
and
that's
a
part
of
the
contentions.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that
is
correct.
and
of
course,
we
can
say
that
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
and
it's
interesting
to
note,
i
will
just
going
to
get
in
a
minute,
that
the
part
of
the
problem
here
is
the
volume
of
cases
that
some
80%
of
the
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia
are
under
the
district
of
columbia
code.
and
in
that
sense,
they
are
local
peculiar
in
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
there
is
one
--
one
new
question
which
has
been
brought
forward
in
this
court
for
the
first
time.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
involves
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
2314,
transportation
of
stolen
property
beyond
the
state.
now,
that
one
question,
newly
added
in
this
court,
involves
a
statute
of
the
united
states
code
in
--
for
that
reason
is
not
local
or
the
opponent
will
immediately
bring
up
of
these
are
evidentiary
problems
which
could
across
both
codes
and
any
kind
of
a
statute.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
it
-
it
would
rise
very
often
in
the
criminal
cases
on
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i
intend
to
go
directly
at
that.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i
will
be
glad
to
your
honor.
that
is,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
principle
reason
this
case
is
here
and
that's
exactly
what
i
intended
to
proceed
now.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
may
it
please
the
court.
this
petitioner
was
given
his
rights
under
the
general
principles
of
the
statute
invoked
section
1915
of
title
28
is
interpreted
by
this
court
in
several
cases
beginning
with
johnson,
farley
and
the
ellis
cases.
he
has
had
these
things.
he
has
said
counsel
assigned
to
him,
very
bad
counsel
who
did
act
as
effortless
as
he
properly
should
have.
secondly,
he
was
furnished
a
transcript
to
the
proceedings
at
government's
expense
to
a
full
and
complete
adequate
transcript,
and
as
i
will
show
is
we
proceed
along
counsel
himself
has
said
that
all
the
documents,
all
the
testimony,
everything
you
didn't
do
consider
this
case
properly
was
use
his
terms
at
hand
so
that
there
was
no
deficiency
in
that
sense.
thirdly,
he
has
had
the
benefit
of
extended
written
argument.
your
honors
will
see
that
printed
in
the
pages
of
this
record
in
this
court
in
the
closely
space
tight
that
these
records
are
printed.
they
initially
filed
a
20
page
that
is
20
of
these
record
pages
document.
this
was
after
the
materials
were
available
to
him.
and
thereafter
filed
a
document
of
some
23,
24
of
this
closely
printed
pages
so
that
thirdly,
he
did
have
the
benefit
of
extended
written
argument,
and
fourthly
is
we
will
show
he
was
given
at
all
of
these
things
were
given
adequate
and
consideration
of
the
issues
raised
by
a
three
judge
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
purport
of
the
argument
i'm
about
to
make
is
to
the
effect
that
is
if
he
is
entitle
to
ignore
more
than
these
which
he
did
have.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
they're
all
here
your
honor.
and
i
intend
to
take
them
to
you
one
by
one.
i
think
that's
the
best
way
i
can
show
what
this
system
or
procedures
are
about.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
we
think
it's
exactly
the
same.
we
think
it
is
exactly
the
same
as
if
a
motion
to
affirm
or
dismiss
have
been
made
and
granted
in
his
case
in
the
full
record
and
everything
to
come
to
this
court
be
considered
in
exactly
the
same
way.
his
case
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
your
honor.
frankly,
that
in
my
opinion
is
a
secondary
issue
here.
the
primary
issue
is
the
way
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
same
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i
think
he
does
have,
your
honor,
exactly
the
same.
this
court
has
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
this
court
has
the
full
record
here.
and
as
any
court
--
this
court,
when
it
sees
an
error
which
is,
an
error
which
can
not
be
further
elucidated
by
briefing
and
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
counsel
cannot
give
anything
more
to
and
the
court
sees
the
error
of
this
court
as
in
the
other
courts
sort
of
funny
noting
or
plainer
can
say
so.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i
think
it's
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
i
think
you
can.
the
only
difficult
between
the
two
cases,
as
i
see
it,
is
in
one,
a
difference
is
paid
to
a
local
law
and
the
court
is
exercising
some
restraint
to
where
the
end
run
result
of
giving
difference
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
of
columbia
to
work
on
its
own
solutions
as
to
local
law.
but
anytime
this
court
sees
a
problem,
local
laws
are
not
local
law,
which
it
thinks
it
should
act
upon
because
of
the
nature
of
the
error.
i'm
sure
this
court
would
no
longer
feel
restrained
and
that
he
would
act
upon
the
error
which
was
disclosed
in
the
record,
be
it
local
law
or
some
other
types
of
law
if
the
need
were
the
court
would
act.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
indeed,
there
is
not
your
honor.
this
case
is
representative
of
one
--
one
type
of
case
as
distinct
from
three
other
types
of
cases.
in
his
case,
the
appellant
process
did
not
include
oral
argument.
it
includes
the
other
facets
that
i've
mentioned
but
they
did
not
include
oral
argument.
the
three
types
that
i'm
about
to
describe
and
distinguish
do
--
do
include
oral
argument
as
a
routine
matter
but
not
as
many
escapable
part
of
the
appellant
processes.
and
that
would
the
escape
would
be
at
motion
to
affirm
and
dismiss
show
cause
why
appeal
should
not
be
granted
for
various
reason.
those
things
would
take
any
case,
wealthy
cases,
indigent
case,
any
type
of
case
from
the
end
run
result
of
oral
argument.
now,
these
are
the
three
types
of
cases
that
are
different.
all
of
the
non-indigent
cases
as
a
routine
but
not
inescapable
end
run
objective
would
get
oral
arguments.
a
second
type
of
case,
as
a
normal
routine,
but
not
inescapable
result,
we
get
oral
argument.
it's
the
forma
pauperis
cases
granted
by
the
district
court.
and
thirdly,
there
are
cases
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals,
petitions
for
forma
pauperis
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
where
the
court
of
appeals
does
itself
put
it
in
the
processes
for
attaining
oral
argument
as
a
normal
routine.
those
were
the
three
types
of
cases
which
are
different
from
the
type
of
case
that
we
have
here.
now,
there
are
no
statistics
available
that
i
know
of
but
considering
the
court
of
appeals
in
and
on
itself,
it
is
probably
true
that
as
many
forma
pauperis
petitions
from
direct
appeals
do
obtain
oral
argument
as
there
are
forma
pauperis
cases
from
direct
appeals
from
the
court
of
appeals
that
do
not
know
whereas
the
oral
argument
thing
as
it
should
finally
given
in
cases
is
approximately
evenly
balanced.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
the
court
of
appeals
has
coming
before
it
petitions
in
the
fiscal
year
1960,
same
year
that
my
opponent
is
referred
to
had
indirect
appeal
cases
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
criminal
conviction.
43
of
those
and
the
court
of
appeals
granted
13
of
those
petitions.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
right.
now,
some
of
those
13,
under
this
system
–-
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
these
are
direct
appeal
cases.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
in
forma
pauperis.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
these
are
petitions
in
forma
pauperis
and
direct
appeal
cases
of
a
--
very
peculiar
type.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
now,
some
of
the
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
now
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
43
total.
direct
appeal
case.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
reason
for
that,
there
are
some
differences
in
our
figures.
i
have
slightly
different.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
but
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
there
were
a
total
of
180.
we
agree
on
that
but
there
was
approximately
137
of
those
that
were
not
direct
appeal
cases.
they
were
collateral
type
cases.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
collateral
type
cases.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
and
i
might
say
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
right.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
but
the
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
--
the
significant
thing
is
that
out
of
the
180
that
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
137
were
not
the
type
that
were
interested
in.
they
were
collateral
type
cases.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
and
i
might
say,
the
question
that
are
raised,
i
think
by
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
were
petitions
then
would
--
and
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
they
have
been
denied.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
fate
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
13
granted
and
30
denied
according
to
my
statistic.
i
think
mr.
boskey
would
be
more
favorable
to
them.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
13
granted.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
30
denied.
i
want
to
thank
mr.
--
mr.
boskey.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
the
collateral
cases,
i'm
not
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
now,
your
honor,
this
--
this
figure
of
43
in
direct
appeal
cases
is
characterized
properly
as
cases
in
which
the
district
court
had
denied
forma
pauperis.
now,
the
figure
in
which
the
district
court
did
grant
forma
pauperis,
it's
greater.
it's
60.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
60.
so
that
there's
no
imbalance,
one
--
from
that
does
not
get
the
picture
that
the
district
court
is
being
arbitrary.
and
it's
--
it's
denying
more
than
the
grants.
are
grants
more
than
the
denial?
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
--
that's
very
true
except
i
bring
this
--
this
point
out,
i
think,
it's
a
part
of
my
opponent's
position
that
the
ellis
case
has
no
impact.
it's
just
--
has
been
of
no
meaning
to
the
district
of
columbia.
the
district
court
has
founded.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i
think
in
the
district
court,
too.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
in
the
district
court.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well
collateral
attack
--
this
court
has
--
has
indicated
and
it's
clearly
understood,
presented
a
different
problem.
a
direct
appeal
is
coming
from
the
conviction.
this
is
the
one
review
that
everyone's
interested
in
the
case.
the
feeling
is
should
get
a
very
careful
handling
at
this
posture.
but
once
his
head
had
careful
handling
or
at
least
the
opportunity
present
a
careful
handling,
then
when
it
comes
up
later
on
the
collateral
attack.
it
does
not
present
the
same
problems.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
right.
now,
a
part
of
the
understanding
that
this
system
is
that
it
is
not
in
this
case
it
had,
perhaps
has
been
in
another
cases.
a
problem
of
the
indigent
versus
the
wealthy
but
rather
the
--
the
heart
of
this
case
is
the
way
in
which
the
indigent
cases
themselves
are
considered
so
that,
in
this
understanding,
the
full
nature
scope
of
the
problem,
the
court
should
also
get
the
still
bigger
picture
in
the
district
of
columbia,
which
is
that
there
are
some
1200
indictments
returned
--
criminal
indicmtments
in
that
jurisdiction
each
year,
approximately
100
indictments
each
month.
some
two-third
of
those
were
disposed
off
without
going
to
trial
but
of
one-third,
approximately,
do
go
to
trial
and
then
in
fiscal
year
1961,
this
was
a
disposition
of
those
cases.
373
went
to
trial.
they
involve
some
455
defendants.
and
the
convictions
were
in
310
cases
that
362
defendants
were
convicted.
this
is
the
potential
for
direct
appeals
each
and
every
year
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
alright.
in
--
in
fis
--
on
fiscal
year
61
figures,
it
would
be
362.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
right.
individuals.
this
is
a
potential.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
this
is
a
gross
total.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
this
is
a
gross
total.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
every
kind
of
defense
each
except
the
municipal
court
work
which
is
the
misdemeanor
jurisdiction.
this
is
the
felony,
the
end
run
result.
this
is
like
a
picture.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
how
many
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
in
--
in
this
court,
this
section
that
does
this
kind
of
work,
it'll
run
between
10
to
12
and
other
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
yes.
they
do
those
cases
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
those
are
convictions.
this
is
the
end
run
result.
they
--
the
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
it
would
run
some
890
in
that
area.
because,
let's
just
say
the
gross
--
the
gross
product
is
some
1200
per
year.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
after
not
guilty
pleas
and
after
the
trial,
either
both
of
the
court
by
the
jury
and
after
the
termination
of
any
motion
to
set
aside
the
verdicts
and
motions
for
new
trial
and
everything
else.
all
--
all
proceedings
throughout
the
way.
this
is
the
rebind
product
if
you
will
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
none
of
it?
no,
none
of
it.
this
is
a
trial.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i
assume
not,
your
honor.
it's
--
it
roughly
a
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
there
are
the
house
breakings
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
it
could
well
be
considered
in
that
light,
your
honor.
but
the
problem
here
and
the
reason
out
here
in
reading
this
case
here
is
because
we
do
not
have
that
type
of
legislation.
in
its
place
we
do
have
this
section
of
national
coverage
starting
in
district
of
columbia
section
1915
in
which
the
congress
has
provided
the
system
which
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
it
is.
it's
a
national
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
it's
been
a
good
number
of
years
but
the
exactly
what
its
origin
is,
i
don't
know.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
sir.
in
the
federal
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
they
are
placed
these
figures
to
that
then
referring
to.
you
can
directly
glean
from
the
brief
in
the
lurk
case
in
the
1960
term
and
that
was
669.
and
--
i
see,
it's
time
for
recess.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
before
the
recess,
i
was
just
concluding
the
coverage
of
certain
statistics
and
i
would
just
like
to
add
to
that,
that
these
figures
are
available
to
the
court
from
independent
means,
that
is
from
the
annual
reports
of
the
administrative
office
of
the
federal
courts,
also
from
the
annual
report
of
the
attorney
general
would
give
an
appraisal
to
this
problem
and
in
addition,
the
brief
in
the
lurk
case
in
the
last
term
do
contain
these
very
particular
figures
that
i
have
referred
to,
the
60
figure
of
being
granted
to
the
district
court
to
43
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
those
figures.
now
this
petitioner,
of
course,
was
denied
forma
pauperis
for
the
court
of
appeals.
but
the
issues
in
this
case
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
granted
column
as
opposed
to
the
denied
column
because
many
of
the
cases
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
initially
considers
under
the
processes
here
do
eventually
go
on
to
become
cases
in
which
oral
argument
is
granted
so
that
there
is
a
difference
to
be
made
in
just
a
column
choice.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
answer
is
he
would
have
had
oral
argument
and
nothing
else.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
procedure
here
is
substantially
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
lurk
case
as
i
know
it.
in
the
lurk
case,
there
was
no
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no
difference
that
i
could
care
to
point
to
at
this
time.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
if
the
lurk
decides
that
question
and
--
my
argument
on
this
procedure
is
no
longer
valid.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
as
we
understand
the
lurk
case,
there
were
new
issues
presented
to
this
court
which
had
not
been
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
considered
the
judge
that
presided
at
the
trial
is
a
judge.
the
issues
raised
in
this
court
were
in
terms
of
the
court
of
custom
and
patents
appeals
as
a
court
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
those
new
issues.
as
i
understand
it,
the
lurk
decision
was
rendered
and
it
was
basically
a
decision
that
that
new
question
which
had
been
injected
in
the
case
in
this
court
should
first
be
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
so
that
in
the
government's
view,
the
lurk
case
in
no
way
passed
upon
the
questions
which
are
involved
here.
and
indeed,
to
support
that
proposition
is
noteworthy,
i
believe
that
it
is
the
same
day,
your
honor,
that
the
lurk
case
was
decided
in
a
way
that
i
suggested
it
was,
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case,
and
i
suggest
that
the
court
would
not
have
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
if
it
felt
that
the
lurk
case,
the
decision
at
the
same
day
was
dispositive
for
the
issue
which
i'm
espousing
here.
so
that
i
believe
the
issue
is
still
here
before
the
court
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
i
make
the
assumption,
your
honor,
that
the
court
would
not
do
a
useless
thing
of
having
this
case
come
off
for
oral
argument.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
and
it's
sent
back
--
the
difference
is,
your
honor,
it
sent
back
a
bigger
issue
--
a
different
issue
really.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
and
for
my
purposes,
it's
not
worthy
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
got
this
new
issue,
court
of
appeals
did
allow
forma
pauperis
in
that
case
and
they
did
come
off
for
oral
argument,
i
believe,
before
all
nine
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals,
sending
it
back,
so
that
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
--
it
was
considered.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
procedure
in
lurk
was
briefed
and
i
believe
argued
by
counsel
in
lurk,
but
at
almost,
the
outset
of
the
consideration
by
the
court
in
the
lurk
case,
we
were
confronted
with
this
proposition
that
there
was
entirely
new
issue
being
presented
for
the
first
time
to
you,
and
that
new
issue
had
not
been
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.
as
i
understand
the
lurk
opinion,
it
is
to
the
effect
that
that
new
--
new
issue
first
presented
here
should
be
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
was
the
purpose
on
the
remand.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
we
do
have
as
a
fifth
issue
of
--
of
merit.
we
do
have
the
claim
that
the
trial
judge
failed
to
instruct
the
jury
properly.
that
issue
was
not
raised
first
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
all
these
issues
can
be
considered
by
the
court
here
and
be
found
to
be
frivolous
as
the
government
suggests
that
they
are
--
that
procedure
can
be
fully
reviewed
and
sustained.
the
matter
--
the
matter
of
select
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
they
have
exactly
the
same
procedures.
they
do
come
up
on
a
calendar.
it's
a
calendar
which
is
called
amongst
the
attorneys,
the
motions
calendar
in
the
sense
that
it
comes
up
distinctive
from
the
oral
argument
calendar
and
this
calendar,
for
these
cases,
is
considered
by
the
court
in
chambers
without
oral
argument
in
it.
as
a
result
of
this
mechanical
distinction
being
made,
and
because
of
the
efficiency
built
into
the
processes,
the
actual
results
in
the
court
of
appeals
are
altered
more
expeditious
in
this
kind
of
case
than
they
are
in
a
regular
appeal.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
he
does.
he
does
and
often
it
is
quicker,
more
--
more
efficient.
indeed
that's
the
principal
reason
for
this
--
this
system,
is
its
efficiency,
its
enabled
to
handle
a
greater
number
of
petitions
and
cases
in
a
more
expeditious
way.
now,
as
a
matter
of
selecting
cases
for
review,
if
your
honors
have
noticed,
some
cases
do
not
go
through
this
review
that
the
court
--
this
particular
case
did.
the
matter
of
deciding
which
cases
will
get
the
review
by
the
transcript
of
proceedings
is
the
heart
of
the
issues
in
this
case,
and
that
process
is
best
identified
and
understood
by
the
record
in
this
case.
as
i
suggested
to
mr.
justice
whittaker
earlier,
the
record
is
entirely
here
every
pleadings
of
note
that
was
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
put
forth
in
a
sequence
here
in
this
record.
and
on
page
1
of
the
record
is
the
prisoner's
own
pre
se
petition
for
forma
pauperis,
and
it's
a
well-done
petition.
it's
much
better
than
the
normal
petition.
on
the
basis
of
that
petition
at
record
page
5,
the
court
of
appeals
without
waiting
for
the
time
to
elapse
for
the
government
to
oppose
the
prisoner's
petition,
did
appoint
him
counsel,
mr.
boskey
was
appointed
by
the
order
appearing
on
page
5.
as
a
result
of
his
appointment,
mr.
boskey
prepared
a
petition
in
support
of
the
memorandum
and
support
of
the
petition
which
begins
on
page
5
and
which
continues
on,
for
some
20
of
these
record
pages
to
record
page
27.
and
as
i've
suggested
to
the
court
earlier,
he
was
given
a
full
opportunity
to
discuss
the
issues
which
were
involved.
record
page
27
is
the
conclusion
of
the
memorandum
by
mr.
boskey
and
this
conclusion
i
think
is
in
support
of
the
process
which
eventually
followed.
and
he
concludes
and
i
quote,
“in
the
foregoing
presentation,
it's
a
substantial
question
to
which
appeared
to
exist
on
appeal
so
far
as
such
a
matter
can
be
assessed
in
the
absence
of
a
transcript,
but
there
may
be
various
other
substantial
questions
disclosed
for
the
transcript.
also,
the
transcript
may
well
lead
to
a
somewhat
different
evaluation”
and
he
proceeds
to
say
that
different
evaluation
may
result
to
the
benefit
of
his
client.
implicit
in
the
statement
i
would
add
is
also
the
contrary
to
the
effect
that
that
evaluation
might
react
contrary
to
his
client.
and
this
is
the
basic
proposition
to
the
system
that
we're
discussing,
which
is
that
criminal
cases
do
have
their
roots
so
deeply
embedded
in
the
patch
of
the
case
as
distinct
from
distinguishing
cases,
presslor
cases
and
that
sort
thing,
the
question
of
whether
the
facts
support
the
legal
arguments
are
so
altered,
determinative
of
the
processes
and
issues,
determined
indeed
whether
or
not
this
particular
process,
the
review
by
transcript,
as
i
term
it,
is
a
valid
process
or
not
a
valid
process,
because
that
is
the
rock
bottom
of
the
consideration
here.
passing
onto
this
record
though,
to
show
that
full
and
complete
consideration
was
given
to
this
matter
by
the
court,
after
mr.
boskey's
statement
was
filed,
the
government
on
page
31,
filed
a
very
short
document
in
which
it
conceded
that
the
transcript
was
needed,
but
the
concession
was
limited
in
it's
purport
to
one
of
the
three
issues
which
mr.
boskey
raised.
government
in
effect
said
that
the
indictment
is
not
a
valid
issue
that
the
disqualification
of
judge
holtzoff
is
not
a
valid
issue,
but
the
matter
of
(inaudible)
and
admissibility
were
his
testimony
is
something
that
we
do
need
to
look
at
the
transcript
and
suggested
that
the
entitlement
to
an
appeal
be
based
rock
bottom
on
what
that
transcript
showed
on
that
one
issue,
and
suggested
that
mr.
boskey
after
he
received
the
transcript
should
again
present
a
memorandum
to
the
court
based
on
that
transcript
of
proceedings,
having
received
it.
mr.
boskey
came
back
in
the
next
several
pages
in
which
he
talks
about
delay
in
the
judicial
process
and
suggests
amongst
other
things
that
his
client
was
entitled,
as
of
the
moment,
to
go
to
oral
argument
with
his
case
despite
the
contention
that
the
back
record
might
well
show
to
the
contrary.
he
also
complained,
of
course,
that
he
should
not
have
to
come
forward
at
that
point
with
the
transcript
himself.
now
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
note
worthy.
it
grants
a
transcript
and
in
that
sense
it
complies
at
least
in
part
with
the
rule
of
the
ellis
case,
but
the
court
of
appeals
ordered,
which
appears
on
page
34,
is
a
response
to
this
situation
which
it
was
confronted
with.
it
did
not
ask
mr.
boskey
to
come
forward
for
the
transcript.
instead,
it
said
to
the
government,
“you
come
forward
with
your
transcript
--
with
your
memorandum
based
on
the
transcript.”
now,
as
i
construe
these
proceedings,
terminology
is
not
there,
but
in
effect,
the
government
was
put
to
burden
of
showing
cause
in
its
next
move
after
the
transcript,
showing
cause
based
on
that
transcript
why
this
case
should
not
go
to
oral
argument,
and
that
of
course
is
exactly
what
the
government
proceeded
to
do.
but
this
one
order,
insignificant
though
it
appears
on
its
face,
this
order,
on
page
34
of
the
record
which
grants
a
transcript
is
the
beginning
and
indeed
the
heart
of
this
process
which
is
challenged
by
my
opponent.
he
says,
“instead
of
getting
only
a
transcript,
i
should've
gotten
forma
pauperis
which
allowed
me
immediately
to
proceed
to
the
in
rem
result
of
oral
argument”
and
that
which
he
did
not
want
to
have
his
case
reviewed
in
the
light
of
the
transcript.
he
wanted
and
instead
to
go
into
a
posture
where
the
implicit
order
of
forma
pauperis
would
put
him
in
a
position,
put
it
in
a
route
where
it
might
not
be
looked
at
any
further
until
the
turn
--
time
of
oral
argument
and
he
wanted
his
case
in
that
position
where
it
would
not
be
looked
at
any
further
until
the
time
of
oral
argument.
one
other
fact,
i
think,
is
significant
about
this
order
on
page
34
that
appears
on
its
face,
the
final
disposition
in
this
case
was
a
split
decision
of
three
judges
in
the
sense
that
judge
bazelon
did
note
his
dissent,
no
opinion
but
he
noted
this
dissent.
the
same
panel
that
ultimately
decided
this
case
had
entered
this
order.
this
order
which
is
at
the
heart
of
the
process
here
in
question
is
a
unanimous
order.
there
is
no
dissent.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
in
forma
pauperis?
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
i'm
speaking
about
the
same
panel
which
had
acted
at
this
earlier
stage.
at
later
stage,
there
was
a
split
but
at
the
earlier
stage
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
--
which
is
the
heart
of
the
screening
review
--
transcript
review
process.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
this
was
a
unanimous
panel
and
there
was
no
split
decision.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
practice
is
that
they
can
do
either
two
things.
simply
note
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
in
fact,
they
are
doing
it
two
ways.
they
simply
note
their
dissent
or
they
are
at
liberty
to.
and
it's
not
unusual
that
there
is
a
printed
opinion
at
--
in
the
nature
of
a
dissent
which
is
attached
to
such
an
order.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
he
does.
he
does
note
his
dissent
at
that
time
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
in
this
particular
case,
he
did
but
not
always,
does
he?
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
in
this
particular
case,
that
he
did.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that
is
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
he
did.
at
the
entry
of
judgment,
he
did
not
--
had
not
at
this
earlier
stage
when
the
transcript
was
granted.
in
other
words,
judge
bazelon
was
in
agreement
with
the
process
which
is
here
in
question.
he
agreed
to
it.
he
did
not
dissent
from
that
process
--
the
process
being
a
transcript
review
process.
he
agreed
that
this
case
was
a
case
of
such
nature
and
such
facts.
the
issue
was
raised
where
such
that
it
indeed
should
go
to
a
screening
consideration
by
the
court
based
on
the
transcript
itself.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
he
did
agree
to
that.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
he
did
agree.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
it
would
go
on
the
oral
argument
calendar
and
that
would
be
to
reassign
it
to
entirely
new
panel
depending
on
the
judges
assigned
at
the
given
time.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
the
record
is
certainly
there,
and
any
illumination
of
the
issues,
the
question
on
authority,
all
of
that
would
be
there
in
the
record
and
would
be
useful,
i'm
sure,
for
the
court
to
have
regardless
to
the
fact
that
they
--
one
or
all
of
the
judges
in
the
case
were
new,
the
case
would
be
epitomized
in
such
a
way
that
a
judge
could
understand
it
in
a
ready
fashion.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
the
basic
spade
work
would
have
been
done
by
this
process.
in
the
regular
appeal
coming
on
for
not
having
gone
through
this
process,
the
spade
work
would
have
to
be
done
initially.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
in
terms
of
dollars
and
cents,
the
money
--
the
bulk
of
the
money
as
was
suggested
earlier
has
been
spent
because
that's
involved
in
the
preparation
of
the
court
reporter's
transcript.
but
what
is
not
considered
in
that
evaluation
is
the
time
of
the
court,
the
time,
for
instance,
of
the
oral
argument
such
as
we're
having
here,
the
matter
that
you
do
have
court-appointed
counsel,
and
you
do
have
to
give
at
least
some
differences
to
having
them
available
for
oral
argument.
the
system
here
is
based
upon
a
--
chambers
--
in
chamber's
consideration
of
things
which
can
be
efficiently
organized
and
the
cases
can
be
considered
in
a
--
in
a
way
which
is
more
susceptible
to
handling
the
volume
of
petitions
in
cases
which
they
do
have
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
difference
is,
in
the
nature
of
cases
and
it's
in
the
nature
of
a
judicial
decision
based
on
those
cases.
some
of
the
indigent
cases
that
mr.
boskey
talks
about
don't
go
through
this
process.
it
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
issues
which
are
raised
and
the
appraisal
of
those
issues
by
the
judges.
the
judges
seeing
some
issues
and
say
that
they're
not
dependent
on
transcript
and
they
--
they
may
not
probably
be
shown
frivolous
on
--
on
the
basis
of
transcript
and
immediately
set
over
for
the
oral
argument
calendar
in
passing
that
way.
in
other
cases,
the
court
looking
at
the
issues
based
upon
the
advocacy
of
counsel
can
say
that
these
issues
look
as
if
they
may
well
be
disposed
off
in
--
in
the
reading
of
the
transcript
and
it's
on
the
basis
of
a
judicial
decision
in
a
particular
case
as
to
what
the
probabilities
are
as
to
a
need
for
oral
argument
and
a
need
for
consideration
of
the
case
through
counsel's
oral
--
orally
arguing
the
case
that
a
decision
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
--
is
made.
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
the
system.
the
only
thing
in
this
--
well,
that
--
that's
correct.
i'll
stop
there.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
full
case
is
open,
your
honor,
because
from
here
--
have
only
gone
part
way
in
this
process,
from
here
on
in,
it's
based
on
the
transcript
that
counsel
does
take
an
advocate's
view,
the
government
takes
a
contrary
view
and
the
decision
is
made
which
is
exactly
the
same
decision
as
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
or
any
court
makes
when
it
passes
on
motion
to
affirm,
dismiss,
or
to
reverse
or
any
kind
of
summary
motion,
all
of
which
are
provided
for
in
--
in
this
court's
rules
and
in
every
court's
rules.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
they
on
occasion
do
write
very
likely
opinions
in
forma
pauperis
cases.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
in
a
normal
case,
it's
certainly
not
as
great
a
volume
of
opinions
in
this
type
of
work
as
there
are
in
the
other
kind
of
work.
the
issues
are
different.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
it
can
indeed.
it
can
know
because
counsel
and
the
government
by
the
adversary
process
have
come
to
grips
on
each
of
these
issues
in
a
way
which
is
as
meaningful
as
any
case
whether
it
was
orally
argued
or
not,
because
if
a
case
is
orally
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals,
there's
no
court
reporter
present.
it's
not
taken
down
in
the
stenographic
fashion.
it
does
not
add
to
an
understanding
of
the
record.
each
and
every
court
has
to
come
back
and
look
at
the
record,
the
same
type
of
record
which
is
here
in
this
case.
what
the
position
of
the
advocates
was
in
the
court
and
what
the
decision
was
in
the
court
in
response
to
those.
and
this
record
is
a
meaningful
record
in
that
sense.
counsel
for
the
government
came
back
in
response
to
the
order
of
the
court,
which
as
i
have
suggested,
was
in
a
nature
of
a
show
cause
processes
and
did
attempt
to
show
cause
in
two
pages
while
these
issues
in
this
particular
case
based
upon
the
transcript
of
proceedings
which
everyone
had
before
them
were
not
issues
of
a
substantial
merit,
that
the
record
transcript
of
proceedings
had
indeed
cast
a
new
light
on
them
as
counsel
have
previously
forecasted
it
might.
and
in
response
to
the
government's
two
pages,
mr.
boskey
came
back
himself
and
said
in
a
document,
which
begins
on
page
40
and
goes
for
some
23
pages
in
this
printed
record
and
on
these
printed
pages,
what
his
issues
were,
how
he
took
a
different
view
of
this
transcript.
now,
for
my
purposes
i
must
point
out
that
on
record
page
40
is
this
concession
that
i
appointed
to,
because
my
opponent
has
referred
to
it
several
times
and
he
says
on
record
page
40,
these
last
document
filed,
accordingly
the
documents
are
now
at
hand
for
an
adjudication
of
this
appeal
on
it's
merits
in
the
same
manner
as
if
petitioner
were
an
appellant
not
indigent.
he
asked
for
this
summary
process
in
these
terms
and
repeated
in
later
phrase
(inaudible)
later
time.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
record
page
40,
near
the
bottom.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
your
honor.
i'll
be
glad
to
come
to
that
issue
immediately.
the
artis'
testimony
in
the
first
trial
was
sworn
testimony
and
it
was
taken
under
oath.
artis
was
physically
unable
to
appear
in
the
second
trial.
at
the
second
trial,
counsel
took
a
position
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
he
was
certainly
physically
incapacitated
and
the
–
the
jury
was
told
that
his
medical
history
did
show
the
mental
picture
also.
the
jury
was
told
that
fact
in
connection
with
the
presentation
of
this
argument.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
schizophrenic
condition.
now,
the
counsel's
position
at
the
trial
level
was
i
believe
different
than
it
is
here.
at
the
trial
level,
he
did
not
want
artis'
testimony
to
come
in
at
all.
and
as
i
understand
him
now,
he
--
he's
not
making
the
same
argument.
he's
not
saying
that
artis'
first
testimony
should
not
come
in
because
of
its
merits
or
demerits.
they
say
in
perhaps
in
a
total
record
of
the
case,
considering
many
and
factors
that
they
should
not
come
in,
but
that's
not
the
argument
he
advanced
in
--
in
the
trial.
the
trial
was
he
said
is
a
pure
and
simple
direct
proposition
of
law.
artis'
testimony
should
not
come
in
because
i
don't
have
the
opportunity
of
giving
it
the
second
go
around
cross-examination
and
the
district
court
says,
“the
cases
are
against
you”
and
indeed
they
are.
the
mattox
case
in
this
court
is
directly
against
that
proposition
and
counsel
doesn't
really
argue
against
the
mattox
case
at
this
time.
now,
the
second
reason
which
was
offered
in
a
trial
level
for
rejection
of
artis'
testimony
was
the
fact
that
this
document,
which
i
have
in
my
hand
and
which
on
record
page
22,
was
now
in
counsel's
position.
and
it's
signed
twice
as
counsel
said
by
artis.
now,
the
proposition
advanced
at
the
trial
level,
as
distinct
from
here,
was
that
because
of
this
document,
artis'
sworn
testimony
at
first
trail
should
not
come
in,
the
earlier
testimony
should
not
come
in.
as
i
understand
his
argument
now,
his
main
argument
is
to
the
effect
well,
the
first
trial
testimony
should
come
in
but
this
document
also
come
in.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
he
offered
this
document
in
this
way,
he
said
to
the
court,
“i
have
here
a
document
which
is
signed
by
artis”
and
the
court
in
effect
said,
“where
did
you
get
it?”
and
he
said,
“well,
i'm
not
sure
how
i
got
it.
i've
found
it
in
the
records
and
files
which
i
got
from
one
of
the
several
attorneys
which
had
represented
this
petitioner
on
an
earlier
trial
--
in
the
earlier
trial,
or
earlier
proceedings,
but
i
don't
know
which
file
it
was.
i
don't
know
which
attorney
gave
it
to
me,
but
i
have
found
it
here.”
now,
this
was
about
the
sum
and
total
of
the
statements
made
by
counsel.
now
the
--
the
initial
decision
by
judge
holtzoff
was
to
the
effect
that,
“well,
if
it's
written
up
in
artis'
handwriting
and
if
it
is
a
valid
document
and
all,
i'll
let
them
both
go
in,
i'll
let
the
sworn
testimony
before
the
jury
in
the
first
trial.
i'll
let
your
document
go
in
to
the
evidence
also.”
but,
later
on,
judge
holtzoff,
in
actually
looking
at
the
document,
found
that
it
was
--
number
one
and
that
no
continuity
was
shown
for
the
document.
it
just
suddenly
appeared,
so
to
speak.
some
question
but
at
least
it
could
have
perhaps
been
shown
whether
artis
signed
it
or
not,
but
it's
not
a
dated
document.
no
tab
appears
on
it.
it
could
well
have
been,
we
suggest,
and
have
in
our
brief,
that
this
document
was
signed
by
artis
before
artis'
trial
in
the
first
testimony
in
the
first
trial,
so
that
his
testimony
represents
the
latest
and
the
best.
and
if
it
were
indeed
in
the
files
of
one
of
the
other
counsel's,
it
perhaps
could
have
been
used
if
they
had
saw
fit
to
do
so
to
impeach
and
discredit
artis
in
the
first
trial.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
exactly
the
position
that
the
government
takes
here,
that
under
no
circumstances
could
it
be
admitted
and
this
is
a
--
the
impediment
in
the
argument
of
counsel.
he
relies
on
the
dissent
in
the
mattox
case
and
the
mattox
case
says
that
it
has
to
be
a
valid
and
proper
document
and
this
doesn't
qualify
even
under
the
dissent
because
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor
and
that's
a
--
basic
position
of
the
government
that
this
document
ought
to
have
something
to
back
it
up,
something
to
support
this
thing.
so
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
signature
appears
on
something
that's
not
even
holographic,
it
doesn't
entitle
to
weight
--
actually
a
weight
given
to
such
documents
or
not.
the
will
case,
the
mere
fact
of
signature,
for
instance,
does
not
qualify
it
on
the
federal
shop
book
rule.
it
doesn't
qualify
under
any
system
that
i
know
for
the
admission
of
evidence.
so
that
the
document
as
such
is
--
is
first
of,
not
admissible
on
its
own
weight,
but
even
if
it
is
admissible
on
its
own
weight,
it
certainly
doesn't
have
end
run
result
that
counsel
contended
for
in
the
trial
court
as
distinct
from
here,
which
his
contention
be
to
exclude
the
sworn
testimony
of
artis
in
the
first
trial.
even
if
it
goes
to
the
first,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
second
and
the
second
and
latter
which
was
the
barring
of
artis'
testimony
in
the
first
trial
was
what
counsel
sought
in
the
first
trial.
and
that
matter
was
disclosed
by
the
transcript
of
proceedings
and
as
i
say,
this
is
an
example
in
support
of
the
transcript
review
process
which
is
the
main
issue
i
think
in
this
case,
a
look
at
the
transcript
of
proceedings
and
not
a
very
hard
look.
it
doesn't
take
very
long
to
ascertain
the
fact
that
counsel,
when
he
said
to
the
court,
number
one,
he
want
to
put
up
--
to
exclude
artis'
sworn
testimony
in
the
first
trial,
but
counsel
immediately
at
the
--
almost
the
outset
of
his
introduction,
he
said
to
the
court,
“i
can't
vouch
for
this
document
or
in
effect
said
that
i
can't
vouch
for
it
because
i
don't
know
where
it
came
from.
i
don't
know
how
i
got
it.
i
just
--
i
can't
say
anything
about
it
except
that
it's
here
and
scrolled
on
it
in
two
places
are
--
what
appears
to
be
or
at
least
what
might
be
the
signature
of
artis.”
now,
those
matters
appeared
from
almost
a
cursory
reading
from
the
transcript
of
proceedings.
and
this,
i
think,
is
a
point
and
a
strong
point
that
does
support
this
preliminary
screening
by
a
look
at
the
transcript
and
that's
the
system
or
the
process
or
the
--
the
way
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
does
attempt
to
handle
its
volume
of
cases.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
exactly
right
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
exactly
the
essence
of
it
and
one
may
wonder
or
why
isn't
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
as
your
honor
phrased
it,
rather
than
being
in
terms
of
a
“denial
of
forma
pauperis.”
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
i
think
what
is
likely
to
happen
upon
seeing
the
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
i
think
the
result
of
--
the
knowledge
of
this
question
would
be
that
--
it
would
be
said
that
the
problem
is
being
understood
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
endeavoring
to
give
weight
to
this
statute
of
congress,
section
1950
has
felt
that
it
must
--
in
giving
weight
to
that
statute
and
yet
following
the
ellis
case
and
earlier
cases,
later
cases,
merged
those
two
propositions
together
so
that
the
order
which
it
enters
is
in
terms
of
the
denial
forma
pauperis,
rather
that
summary
affirm
or
summery
reversal
as
counsel
asked
for
in
this
case.
it's
--
it's
the
middle
ground
and
it's
caused
and
compelled
by
the
statute.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
it
has
indeed.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
if
your
honor
please,
the
problem
that
ellis
was
presenting
was
whether
or
not
clearly
frivolous
would
have
the
affect
of
--
of
clogging
its
calendars,
putting
such
burden
on
it
that
it
could
not
handle
it.
this
system
that
we've
been
discussing
is
the
response
to
ellis.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor
insofar
as
the
--
the
question
deemed
simply
with
the
statements
of
the
judge,
i
point
that
in
this
case
the
--
the
best
thing
that
counsel
could
hope
for
or
would
want
in
this
direction
would
be
the
cross-examination
of
artis
in
the
first
trial
because
this
is
the
rock
bottom
of
the
foundation
from
which
the
--
the
judge's
statement
flowed
and
if
there
are
proper
statements,
then
the
same
response
would
flow
from
any
reading
or
hearing
of
that
testimony.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
and
--
and
in
that
cross
examination
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
now
that
cross-examination
did
come
in,
the
jury
heard
it
linked,
all
of
it.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
so
that
i
would
say
that,
if
the
--
if
the
remark
is
something
that
should
be
told
to
the
jury,
the
jury
would
have
had
the
exactly
the
same
reaction
from
having
heard
the
testimony
itself,
the
cross-examination,
and
it
did
in
the
prosecution.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
i
do
think
it's
frivolous
and
my
reasons
and
i
concede,
your
honor,
does
have
a
very
valid
point
that
coming
from
the
judge
or
at
least
someone
who
has
seen
the
personal
appearance
of
the
witness
does
make
a
difference,
but
they
have
both
here.
on
page
39
--
139
of
this
record,
is
the
trans
--
is
a
testimony
and
statements
of
one
who
did
see
this
witness
testify
and
the
person
--
the
witness
who
testified
before
the
jury
and
described
it
is
the
attorney
for
this
petitioner
in
the
first
trial.
the
attorney's
name
is
mr.
deats,
mr.
deats
is
testifying
and
he
goes
at
some
length
to
describe
what
type
of
witness,
and
what
type
of
the
individual
artis
was.
now
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
attorney
for
this
defendant
as
i
recall
in
the
first
--
first
trial,
but
he's
testimony
only
goes
to
the
--
to
the
effect
of
what
type
of
witness
artis
was.
what
is
his
personal
appearance
was?
and
mr.
deats
goes
at
some
length
that
he
--
he
certainly
crystallizes
it
on
page
139,
and
justice
clearway
as
clear
way
as
judge
holtzoff
did
in
the
first
trial
and
mr.
deats'
crystallization
is
this,
“i
couldn't
honestly
say
that
i
believed
artis
--
i
wouldn't
believe
artis
under
any
circumstances.”
now
that
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
he
--
he
is
the
attorney
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor
the
observation
for
the
judge
comes
in
which
supports
this
proposition,
i
think,
is
the
equivalent,
it's
not
the
same,
but
it's
the
equivalent,
when
the
judge
and
the
--
and
instruction
to
the
jury
in
the
second
trial
says
that
all
accomplices,
and
artis
is
one,
“you
should
scream
with
care
and
caution.”
and
when
a
judge
in
instructing
the
jury
this
is
not
comment
--
as
correlate
(inaudible)
amongst
other
facts
and
matters
that
occurred
during
the
course
of
trial,
this
is
the
supreme
moment,
as
far
as
the
jury
is
concerned
here
in
the
judge
and
when
in
that
moment,
and
the
judges
--
the
court
--
the
jury
rather
in
all
of
them
are
giving
all
of
their
attention
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
says,
“a
fellow
like
artis
who
is
an
accomplice,
you
should
look
out
with
care
and
caution.”
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
he
certainly
does
follow
it.
i
--
i
would
only
take
exception
with
the
word
“peculiar”
because
i
think
counsel
in
arguing
that
point
in
his
brief
points
out
in
a
footnote
that
each
and
every
numbered
circuit,
and
he
goes
to
circuit
number
one,
second
circuit,
third
circuit
and
right
on
down
through
the
tenth
circuit,
as
i'm
understanding
from
he's
own
footnote
and
in
petitioner's
own
brief,
is
to
the
effect
that
every
circuit
comes
to
the
same
conclusion.
the
judge
certainly
followed
with
the
comment,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
every
circuit
without
exception
as
i
know
is
following
that
--
that
situation.
