mr.
bennett
boskey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
group
of
contempt
cases
which
the
court
has
been
hearing
during
the
past
few
days
has
dealt
with
a
rather
broad
range
of
subjects
on
the
federal
criminal
law
and
its
relationship
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
case
to
which
we
now
task
coppedge
against
the
united
states
deals
with
many
other
aspect
of
the
relationship
between
the
federal
criminal
law
and
the
constitution.
and
the
range
of
the
subject
is
broad
and
the
subjects
are
important.
the
subjects
include
the
very
difficult
and
perplexing
problem
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
in
forma
pauperis
cases
in
the
federal
court
and
the
assurance
that
equal
justice
on
the
law
shall
be
rendered
to
the
poor
as
well
as
to
the
rich.
it
includes
problems
as
to
the
responsibilities
of
the
grand
jury
of
the
court
of
the
prosecutor.
it
includes
questions
of
evidence
and
charges
to
the
jury.
it
includes
questions
of
prejudicial
summation
as
the
petitioner
view
with
the
case.
now,
as
the
governor
--
government
views
the
case
according
to
its
brief
in
this
court,
all
of
the
petitioner's
contentions
are
frivolous.
the
government
says
this
in
53
pages
of
its
preventive
brief.
for
this
reason,
i
should
like
just
to
pause
a
moment
on
the
procedure
which
is
taken
place
in
the
efforts
of
this
petitioner
to
obtain
an
appellant
review
on
the
merits.
and
then
i
shall
test
to
the
subsequent
questions
involved
in
the
case.
the
case
involved
in
attempt
by
this
petitioner
to
obtain
a
direct
appellant
review
from
a
criminal
conviction
in
the
court
of
--
in
the
district
of
--
columbia
district
court.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
charges
of
attempting
to
utter
--
uttering
and
transporting
an
interstate
commerce,
three
separate
forged
money
orders
which
had
been
stolen
shortly
before
they
were
used
in
the
manner
charged
in
this
case.
this
in
fact
was
not
his
first
trial
but
his
second.
his
conviction
at
the
first
trial
having
been
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
because
prejudicial
newspaper
articles
had
appeared
during
the
course
of
the
trial
and
because
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
judge
holtzoff,
who
had
acted
as
the
trial
judge
in
the
first
trial
of
the
case,
had
not
taken
sufficient
steps
to
assure
that
the
prejudice
would
not
affect
deliberations
of
the
jury.
when
the
case
was
remanded,
it
was
tried
again.
and
at
the
second
trial,
petitioner
was
represented
by
court
appointed
counsel.
after
the
jury's
verdict
was
brought
in
and
a
verdict
to
guilty
on
count
three
through
10,
the
petitioner
having
been
acquitted
by
the
jury
on
the
so-called
housebreaking
and
blartney
charge.
after
the
verdict
was
brought
in,
petitioner
was
sentenced
by
judge
holtzoff
and
then
he
sought
in
the
usual
course
to
take
an
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
stating
an
indigent.
judge
holtzoff
denied
his
application
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
and
in
addition
certified
that
the
appeal
was
frivolous
and
not
taken
in
good
faith.
this,
as
i
am
sure,
the
court
knows
from
other
cases
which
have
come
to
you
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
is
something
which
happens
over
and
over
again
in
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
as
happens
almost
in
all
of
these
cases.
the
petitioner
here
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
bennett
boskey
mr.
justice
brennan
has
now
--
the
court
appointed
counsel
with
relieved
of
his
appointment
by
the
court
and
from
the
date
on
which
he
was
relieved,
it
might
not
the
100%
certain
whether
he
did
or
did
not
play
any
part
in
the
attempt
to
get
an
appeal
allowed
by
judge
holtzoff.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
would
suggest
that
he
provided
any
subsequent
help
to
the
petitioner
in
the
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
that
looks
as
though
would
entirely
approach
the
operation
although
one
cannot
be
quite
that
sure.
in
any
of
them,
counsel
did
obtain
from
judge
holtzoff
an
order
relieving
on
of
his
first
(inaudible)
from
the
case.
and
i
--
this
certainly
is
not
in
criticism
of
counsel
because
this
is
the
custom
or
has
been
until
about
a
month
ago
in
the
district
of
columbia.
there
is
some
implication
that
with
the
legal
aid
agency
which
congress
created
beginning
to
get
the
work
in
this
area
that
more
encouraged
than
to
give
them
to
lawyers
who
are
appointed
from
the
district
court
to
provide
some
help
in
connection
with
the
initial
application
in
the
district
court.
in
any
of
that
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
what
--
do
you
mean
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes.
mr.
bennett
boskey
without
distinguishing
between
direct
appeals
and
collateral
effect
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes.
the
number
is
substantial.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
--
i
think,
i
have
the
number
for
the
fiscal
year
1960
and
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
that's
fiscal
year
1960.
mr.
bennett
boskey
about
180
petitions
believed
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
were
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
fiscal
1960
as
of
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
after
it
has
been
denied
in
the
district
court.
yes.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bennett
boskey
no,
by
the
district
court.
and
then
they
come
up
after
the
denial
by
the
district
court.
they
come
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
new
application,
as
the
court
of
appeals
allowed,
on
a
new
application
to
the
court
of
appeals
believed
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
to
be
granted.
now,
the
procedure
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
when
we
it
receives
such
an
application
if
the
case
is
a
direct
appeal,
as
this
one
was.
when
it
received
such
an
application
it
then,
in
all
cases
appoint
counsel
if
the
petitioner
is
unrepresented
unless
he
affirmatively
indicated
if
does
not
wish
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
and
the
task
of
counsel
is
then
to
write
initially
--
to
write
a
memorandum
in
support
of
the
petition
believed
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
that
was
the
procedure
which
was
followed
in
this
case.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
mr.
justice
whitaker.
and
in
the
fiscal
year
1960,
there
were
24
granted
by
the
court
of
appeals
out
of
the
one
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
out
of
the
180.
mr.
bennett
boskey
those
figures
i
don't
have
because
such
statistics
as
i
have
--
i
obtained
from
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
just
would
have
know
whether
it
knowing.
mr.
bennett
boskey
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
--
you
embarrass
me
because
i'm
going
to
have
to
cite
an
article
which
i
wrote
at
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
--
in
the
university
of
minnesota
law
review
for
april
1961.
but
the
question
is
where
did
i
obtain
for
the
article?
mr.
bennett
boskey
and
i
obtained
them
from
the
article
--
for
the
article
by
consulting
records
in
the
court
of
appeals
clerk's
office
where
the
clerk's
office
keeps
on
cards
a
record
of
what
type
of
case
it
is
and
what
happened
to
the
killer.
mr.
bennett
boskey
the
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
the
general
statistics
of
the
courts,
i
think,
would
not
furnish
the
kind
of
figures
we're
now
are
discussing.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
although
it
just
appeared.
mr.
justice
douglas
converted
forward
to
them.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
would
think
not
now
and
hope
not,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
bennett
boskey
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
dealt
with
that
question
on
page
33
of
my
brief
and
here
is
what
i
find.
it
is
not
easy
to
make
an
exhaust
search
of
miscellaneous
unpublished
order.
but
within
the
limits
of
reason,
i've
made
the
search
in
the
court
of
appeals
extending
back
over
the
last
six
to
seven
years.
during
that
period,
i
could
not
find
and
i
can
only
say
the
government
has
not
produced
a
single
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
a
paid
appeal
as
frivolous
until
a
case
decided
in
may
1961,
which
is
while
this
case
was
pending
here
on
petition
for
certiorari,
which
is
cited
in
the
footnote
on
page
33
of
my
brief.
and
in
that
one
single
case
which
i
had
found,
the
dismissal
took
place
only
after
there
was
full
briefing
and
full
oral
argument
on
the
merits
of
the
case
so
that
whether
the
disposition
--
the
ultimate
disposition
be
called
a
dismissal
or
affirmant,
the
fact
is,
that
in
that
one
case,
the
paid
appellant
had
full
briefing,
sold
oral
argument
before
the
court.
and
now
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
during
the
sign
period
--
this
was
denied
from
mr.
coppedge,
my
client
and
not
only
was
it
denied
to
him.
during
the
fiscal
year
1960,
there
are
30
of
the
case
were
indigent
criminal
appellants
on
direct
appeals
which
not
exactly
the
same
thing
or
more
that
this
petitioner
was
guide
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
would
make
just
that
statement
that
the
figures
that
i
have
cited,
i
think,
are
in
refreshers
as
figures
alone.
i
must
say
that
as
a
member
of
the
bar,
i
have
read
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
criminal
cases
now
for
ten
years,
i
think,
without
exception.
i
think
its
perfectly
clear
that
the
questions
which
the
court
of
appeals
passes
on
or
writes
opinions
about
in
paid
appeals
by
far
or
less
weighty
than
many
of
the
questions
involved
in
this
in
forma
pauperi
cases
in
which
their
denial
leads
to
appeal.
and
i
do
say
that
a
good
city
even
a
good
system
cannot
be
a
system
which
works
one
way
of
the
rich
and
one
way
of
the
poor.
and
i
say
it
further
that
this
system
as
it
is
now
working
is
not
a
good
system.and
i
come
to
why
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
now,
on
the
question
whether
it's
a
good
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
well
apparently,
it
is
something
that
has
almost
never
happened
in
the
government
and
its
brief
says,
“well,
it
could
happen.”
and
the
--
the
fact
that
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
bennett
boskey
perhaps,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
they
should,
although
i
have
to
say
that
i
think
a
great
view
of
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
think
a
great
deal
of
the
trouble
in
effect,
the
presences
from
the
procedure
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
government
as
well
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
way
in
which
these
cases
are
half
of
--
on
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
as
well
as
the
court
of
appeals
is
paying
no
attention
to
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
ellis
case
is
using
the
word
“frivolous”
as
the
semantic
device
to
describe
traditions
with
the
government
had
to
disagree
with
and
this
--
in
the
long
run
causing
much
more
a
time
to
be
spent
on
these
cases.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
think
that's
perfectly
clear
then
--
it's
not
just
from
the
burden
on
the
bar.
i
assure
you
it
is
that
it's
a
problem
at
the
bar
and
the
judges
who
share
together.
and
the
burden
has
become
almost
intolerable.
and
the
system
is
not
worth
it.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
in
this
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
as
in
the
lurk
case,
which
came
before
you
last
term,
most
of
the
money
was
paid
out
the
transfer
it
was
paid
for
--
the
transcript
frequently
has
paid
for.
the
only
thing
that
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
think
that
has
become
evident
from
the
experience
of
those
who
have
to
tried
live
with
this
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
i'm
quite
prepared
now
to
talk
about
where
the
mr.
mark
coppedge
floated
the
docket
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
bennett
boskey
that's
really
what
i
--
the
in
forma
pauperis
problem
is
one
that
is
with
all
of
these.
there
isn't
any
simple
solution
to
it.
by
hindsight,
i
think
perhaps
if
this
court
in
some
of
the
eight
or
nine
cases
where
it
has
per
curiam
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
in
these
cases
and
authenticates
fact.
if
this
court
in
one
or
two
more
after
ellis
had
written
some
sort
of
opinion
which
would
explain
and
over
again
to
the
court
of
appeals.
what
this
court
meant
when
it
wrote
the
ellis
opinion,
possibly
that
would
have
done
from
good.
mr.
bennett
boskey
to
me,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it's
clear
its
can
be.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
think
it
might
--
would
be
mighty
helpful
and
perhaps
in
this
the
government
would
give
a
hand.
now,
as
i
say,
in
this
case,
the
government
in
53
printed
pages
says
all
my
arguments
are
frivolous.
if
they're
right,
i'm
wasting
my
own
time
as
i
wasted
time
with
the
two
courts.
and
it
would
be
an
active
mercy
for
the
court
to
tell
me
so.
petitioner
doesn't
think
the
government
is
right.
petitioner
thinks
that
the
only
frivolous
aspect
to
this
case,
if
the
government's
contention,
this
case
is
frivolous.
and
if
i
may,
i
want
to
go
in
to
the
merits.
there
is
--
there's
a
problem
about
the
--
the
merits
and
namely,
suppose
i
am
right,
what
should
this
court
do
about
it,
i
dealt
with
this
in
the
brief,
should
the
court
pass
on
the
merits
or
should
the
court
vacate
the
judgment
and
send
the
case
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
pass
on
the
merit
initial.
and
in
my
brief,
i
have
given
examples
of
cases
where
this
court
has
have
a
little
bit
each
way.
i
think,
in
this
case,
there
are
fairly
compelling
consideration
to
this
court
to
pass
on
the
merits
and
let
me
imagine
what
they
are.
first,
this
petitioner
was
convicted
of
this
crime
in
march
1960
which
is
getting
on
to
be
almost
two
years
ago.
mr.
bennett
boskey
this
petitioner
is
lorton
reformatory,
serving
his
sentence,
he
didn't
begin
to
serve
the
sentence
until
about
five
weeks
ago
because
he
was
there
on
a
prior
sentence.
but
he
is
now
serving
his
sentence.
the
indigent,
his
prospects
for
being
released
on
bail,
i
think,
are
zero.
mr.
bennett
boskey
what
is
lorton
reform
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
it's
for
adult.
it's
--
it's
not
a
juvenile
or
youth.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it's
a
minimum
security.
i
think
it's
something
like
denver
is.
maybe
even
a
grade
below
down.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it's
a
present.
mr.
bennett
boskey
no,
it's
a
penitentiary.
it's
a
--
you're
in
cell
blocks
mr.
bennett
boskey
now,
as
i
say,
the
petitioner
is
now
serving
his
sentence.
the
long
delay
in
his
getting
an
appellate
review
of
this
case
is
no
fault
his.
and
as
i
shall
hope
to
show
in
a
moment,
the
questions
that
are
arise
in
this
case
arrives
largely
in
connection
to
the
meaning
and
application
of
this
court's
decision
in
three
or
four
cases.
and
therefore,
the
clarification
of
the
meaning
and
application
of
those
decisions
could
more
properly
come
from
this
court,
i
think,
that
it
could
from
the
court
of
appeals.
in
any
event
by
arguing
the
merits
in
my
brief,
as
i
have,
i
have
put
the
case
before
you
so
that
the
court
will
have
no
difficulty
coming
to
its
own
conclusion
on
whether
the
contentions
are
frivolous.
there
are
several
groups
of
contentions.
the
first
has
to
do
with
a
problem
as
to
the
validity
of
the
indictment.
this
problem
is
one
which
the
briefs
deal
with
at
length.
but
despite
that,
i
want
to
say
a
say
a
few
words
about
it
on
oral
argument.
what
happened
was
that
after
the
case
was
sent
back
was
remanded
by
the
court
of
appeals
after
the
first
conviction
was
reversed.
the
new
account,
new
counsel's
who
was
been
appointed
to
represent
petitioner
at
the
second
trial,
made
a
motion
in
the
district
court
attacking
the
validity
of
the
indictment.
and
attached
to
that
motion,
there
was
bundle
of
papers.
one,
a
signed
statement
by
a
man
named
tompkins,
who
had
testified
before
the
jury,
two,
a
letter
from
tompkins,
and
three
and
four,
two
documents
which
had
been
prepared
for
tompkins
signature
but
had
not
been
signed.
all
four,
together
with
the
motion,
were
placed
before
the
jury
--
that
--
were
placed
before
the
district
court.
and
the
motion
came
up
for
argument
before
judge
mcguire.
now,
the
transcript
of
the
argument
appears,
it
is
reproduced
and
it's
entirely
in
the
record
in
the
case.
it
isn't
very
long.
its
pages
65
to
72
of
printed
record
here.
the
petitioner's
contention
is
that
two
questions
were
raised
by
these
papers
presented
on
the
motion.
first,
the
claim
that
tompkins
had
given
substantial
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
that
this
substantial
evidence
was
what
resulted
in
--
in
the
indictment
filed
the
petitioner
by
the
grand
injury
and
that
tompkins
now
repudiated
his
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
said
that
he
was
a
liar
in
the
perjury
and
had
given
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
in
order
to
receive
third
consideration
for
himself,
which
he
was
promised
so
that
the
first
question
raised
by
the
motion
and
preserved
here
on
the
briefs
is
whether
when
there
is
substantial
perjured
testimony,
which
has
resulted
in
the
indictment
of
the
defendant
and
where
the
issue
is
properly
raised
before
trial,
not
after,
but
before
trial.
mr.
bennett
boskey
at
the
second
trial.
but
before
the
trial
took
place.
mr.
bennett
boskey
and
was
entertained
by
the
judge.
so,
there's
no
question
about
funds.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
was
here
in
fact
and
the
motion
was
entertained.
mr.
bennett
boskey
and
passed
on.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes.
in
such
a
case,
whether
the
mere
--
the
mere
fact
that
there
may
have
been
other
competent
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
automatically
tell
the
gist
in
the
indictment.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i'll
come
to
that
at
second
issue
here.
it
is
our
position
that
the
papers
sufficiently
raised
exactly
that
claim.
that
the
papers
sufficiently
articulated
a
claim
that
this
testimony
had
been
induced
by
an
fbi
agent
named
woods
and
by
the
prosecutor
mr.
flanery
and
that
it
was
induced
with
considerations
promised
to
tompkins.
and
tompkins
was
made
available
to
the
court
to
be
heard
as
a
witness
if
the
court
so
a
fit
the
column
on
this
motion
which
the
court
did
not.
mr.
bennett
boskey
he
was
at
that
time
in
jail.
mr.
bennett
boskey
he
was
a
codefendant
that
he
--
and
he
would
--
he
also
had
been
convicted
on
another
charged.
and
i
believe
--
i'm
not
sure
at
that
date
which
sentence
he
would
serve.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
at
that
time,
the
charge
--
yes,
he
was
awaiting
disposition
of
the
charge.
but
the
charge
had
informally
been
made
in
the
indictment.
he
was
named
in
the
same
indictment.
and
a
--
a
plea
was
accepted
of
guilty
to
one
count.
mr.
bennett
boskey
oh
yes.
mr.
bennett
boskey
and
he
implicated
petitioner.
mr.
bennett
boskey
he
implicated
petitioner.
mr.
bennett
boskey
precisely.
now,
the
government
says
in
his
brief
in
this
court
that
the
question
you
just
asked
me
about
mr.
justice
harlan
namely
whether
the
government
was
implicated
in
this.
the
government
says
this
was
never
seriously
urged
below.
we
say
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
transcript
where
judge
mcguire
makes
it
perfectly
plain
with
judge
mcguire
understood
the
papers
to
raise
that
question
--
that
precise
question.
and
that
coming
now
two
years
and
two
courts
later,
the
contention
of
the
government
that
this
was
never
seriously
raised.
it
doesn't
square
with
the
record.
mr.
bennett
boskey
judge
mcguire
rejected
the
motion
in
an
opinion
which
relied
largely
on
the
--
this
court
opinion
in
the
costello
case
and
said,
as
i
was
just
about
to
tell
you
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
judge
holtzoff
presided
in
both
trials
and
one
of
the
issues
here
is
whether
he
should
have
disqualified
himself
for
prejudice.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
cannot
answer
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
it
may
possibly
be
that
the
case
has
been
firmly
assigned
to
judge
holtzoff
to
try
at
the
time
the
motion
came
out.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
have
been
told
that
after
an
assignment
is
firmly
made
where
judge
to
try
a
case
that
is
so
prior
to
that
time,
it
is
not.
we
say
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
point
was
fully
understood
by
judge
mcguire.
when
petitioner's
counsel
started
to
elaborate
the
grounds
of
that
hearing
the
court
said
--
judge
mcguire
said
here,
“when
woods
promised
to
a
witness
to
go
before
the
grand
jury,
he
wouldn't
be
prosecuted
if
he
testified
against
coppedge
is
that
it.
and
the
petitioner's
counsel
said,
“yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.”
and
then
the
court
said,
as
i
understand
the
gist
of
the
affidavit,
“it
is
to
the
effect
that
the
witness
who
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
was
promised
if
he
went
before
the
grand
jury
and
testified
falsely
against
the
defendant
in
this
case,
he
would
himself
not
be
prosecuted.
is
that
it?”
and
counsel
said,
“well,
if
not
prosecuted,
he
would
be
given
certain
consideration?”
“yes.”
there
is
no
any
doubt
that
judge
mcguire
understood
this
issue
was
raised
by
the
government
being
implicated.
and
we
say
it
was
raised
enough
to
create
an
issue
of
fact
which
should
not
have
been
tried
and
heard.
now,
what
is
the
obstacle
to
it?
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
didn't
really
deal
to
this
point
very
much,
but
it
said
that
the
costello
case
just
created
the
complete
bar
to
any
inquiry
into
what
evidence
the
grand
jury
did
or
didn't
interfere.
i
would
say
to
that
as
i
have
been
in
the
reply
brief,
the
costello
case,
which
very
carefully
traced
the
history
of
the
grand
jury
as
an
institution.
the
costello
decision
carefully
stated
that
the
question
before
the
court
was
whether
hearsay
could
be
used
before
the
grand
jury.
and
the
--
the
court
unanimously,
and
i
think
quite
obviously,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
rules
of
evidence
were
not
to
be
technically
applied
in
grand
jury
proceeding
and
that
whether
evidence
was
or
was
not
hearsay
was
not
a
proper
subject
for
inquiry
by
the
court.
the
court
did
not
in
that
case
or
in
the
later
lawn
case
or
on
the
prior
fault
case
where
mr.
justice
holmes
wrote
the
opinion.
the
court
never
dealt
with
--
has
never
dealt
so
far
as
i've
been
able
to
ascertain
with
the
perjury
question.
what
do
you
do
if
you
have
substantial
perjury
that
was
used
before
the
grand
jury
to
obtain
the
indictment?
now
we
say
first,
if
the
government
is
implicated
in
the
perjury,
it's
a
perfectly
clear
case.
you
cannot
have
a
system
of
justice
where
an
overzealous
or
a
dishonest
or
an
evil
minded
prosecutor
could
deliberately
take
perjured
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
and
detain
an
indictment
and
then
have
a
rule
of
law
that
said
this
shall
never
been
inquired
into
by
any
court.
we
say
that
that
was
the
contrary
to
the
whole
spirit
of
this
court's
decisions
on
the
knowing
use
or
knowing
allowance
of
perjured
prosec
--
testimony
by
a
prosecution.
and
apart
from
the
constitution
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
was,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
was
prosecuted
by
indictment.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
mr.
chief
justice
whitaker,
i
was
dealing
with
the
other
case
first
where
the
prosecutor
clearly
and
crucially
had
deliberately
brought
perjured
testimony
before
a
grand
jury
in
order
to
secure
an
indictment.
now,
we
say
if
that
kind
petition
appears
that
is
an
abused
of
the
courts.
it's
an
abused
of
the
grand
jury
system
and
to
allow
that
indictment
to
stand
deprive
a
defendant
of
the
protection
of
this
court
has
said
in
the
grand
jury
system
it
supposed
to
provide.
it's
to
protect
him
against
that
kind
of
oppression
by
the
prosecutor.
not
to
have
the
grand
jury
act
as
a
rubber
stamp
for
the
prosecution
or
become
unwillingly
an
accomplice
of
the
prosecuted
who
does
such
a
thing.
now,
that's
the
first
case
whether
is
knowing
complicity
by
the
prosecution.
and
we
say,
we
should
have
had
a
hearing
on
that
point
here.
and
the
failure
to
give
us
the
hearing
was
erroneous.
now,
i
come
to
the
second
case
which
i
think
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
think,
you
have
to
have
a
satisfactory
inquiry,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
bennett
boskey
and
was
not
had
here.
and
that
the
witness
tompkins
was
available
to
the
court.
he
could
have
been
called.
the
prosecutor
was
available.
the
fbi
agent
mr.
--
mr.
woods
was
available
all
within
the
confine
of
that
building.
they
could
have
had
all
the
hearing
they
wanted
on
this
issue
on
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
never
said
that.
a
hearing
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
--
i
would
say
that
hearings
maybe
of
many
types.
there
are
many
types
of
hearings
where
affidavits
are
useful,
helpful,
admissible,
competent.
they
weren't
used
here.
the
government
filed
no
written
affi
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes.
mr.
bennett
boskey
and
there
was
not
enough
left
anyway.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
i
was
suggesting
that
as
one
easy
convenient
way
for
the
judge
to
have
gotten
the
truth
without
taking
two
years
to
find
out
what
it
was
but
to
take
an
hour.
that
was
the
easiest
thing
he
could
have
done.
and
i'm
saying
he
should
have
done
it.
and
his
failure
to
do
it
means
that
this
petitioner
has
been
deprived
of
the
kind
of
hearing
his
entitled
to
whether
by
hearing
the
witnesses
personally
by
affidavits
or
by
anything
else.
the
government
filed
knowing
after
to
this
motion.
it
filed
no
written
answer.
it
didn't
controvert
any
with
this.
it
just
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
under
the
costello
decision
and
that
is
not
what
the
costello
decision
has
ever
been
said
to
me
in
before.
now,
i
have
one
other
point.
i'm
reminded
out
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
summary
of
judge
mcguire's
decision
mainly
that
judge
mcguire
said,
"well,
i've
looked
at
the
grand
jury
minutes.
and
there's
enough
further
evidence
here."
the
petitioner's
trial
counsel
tried
his
best
to
get
hold
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
because
he
wasn't
satisfied
with
judge
mcguire.
he's
the
only
one
who
has
looked
at
them.
and
see
what
there
was
to
that.
and
he
was
denied
access
to
the
minutes.
and
when
i
try
to
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
rethought,
i
said
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
was
hard
to
have
denied
access
to
the
grand
jury
minutes
--
petitioner's
counsel
but
in
any
event,
even
if
you
are
going
to
do
that.
at
the
very
minimum,
the
court
of
appeals
has
an
obligation
to
look
in
camera
at
the
grand
jury
minutes
to
see
whether
judge
mcguire
was
right
but
whether
the
perjured
evidence
was
the
entire
evidence
in
implicating
petitioner.
so
far
as
i
know
and
so
far
as
any
available
record
show,
the
court
of
appeals
has
never
look
at
the
grand
jury
minutes,
never
passed
on
this
point.
the
point
remains
open
in
the
case
here.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
was
not
given
any
such
opportunity.
mr.
bennett
boskey
this
case
--
and
in
these
case
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
certainly
did.
i
suggest
that
it
was
such
bigger
as
i
possess.
and
the
government's
answer
to
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
they
should
also
said
there
weren't
enough
subs
--
the
case
was
not
substantial
to
--
to
warrant
an
in
forma
pauperis
appeal.
the
government
answer
was
that
on
the
costello,
no
such
examination
of
the
grand
jury
transcript
by
the
court
was
required.
mr.
bennett
boskey
he
made
a
motion.
he
didn't
just
say
he
would
like
to
see.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
was
after.
what
happen
was
that
the
very
end
of
the
trial
colloquy
and
before
judge
mcguire,
the
government
said,
well,
they
make
the
grand
jury
transcript
available.
then
apparently
what
happened
was
that
the
petitioner's
counsel
tried
to
get
the
same
transcripts
from
the
prosecutor
that
the
prosecutor
was
giving
to
the
judge.
and
he
was
totally
unsuccessful.
he
then
made
a
motion
saying
in
the
motion
that
he
had
tried
to
get
transcript.
he
couldn't.
he
felt
he
had
a
right
to
see
it
to
be
able
to
argue
whatever
the
transcript
showed
on
this
whole.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i've
given
you
the
sum
total
of
my
knowledge,
your
honor
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
on
page
72
of
the
record,
at
the
very
end
of
the
colloquy
before
judge
mcguire.
it
says
as
follows,
“the
court
--
the
court,
well,
i
think
i
should
have
it
if
it's
written
off”,
mr.
flaner,
prosecutor.
part
of
this
is
written
off.
i
will
check
my
file
on
that
and
if
all
isn't
written
off,
i
will
get
it
written
up
and
submit
it
to
your
honor.
and
your
honor
can
clearly
see
what
occurred
before
the
grand
jury.
the
court,
i
will
take
it
under
advisement.
that's
all
i
know
about
it.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes.
and
i
assume
in
some
way
they
are
after.
the
--
the
document
was
passed
to
the
judge
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
bennett
boskey
your
honor,
i've
been
with
this
case
only
since
april
of
1960.
mr.
bennett
boskey
one
always
has
second
thoughts
about
what
might
have
been
done
and
it's
nearly
a
siege.
but
the
point
really
to
be
made
is
that
this
lawyer,
who
represented
coppedge
in
the
district
court,
was
quite
vigorous
on
--
on
all
these
point
i
have
been
talking
about.
conceivably
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
bennett
boskey
he
made
a
motion.
mr.
bennett
boskey
and
the
motion
was
denied
by
judge
holtzoff
when
it
later
came
on
and
that
also
is
in
the
transcript
and
as
a
matter
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
the
--
the
motion
to
see
the
transcript
then
got
a
sign
of
judge
holtzoff.
mr.
bennett
boskey
one
every
knows
because
a
motion
to
reconsider
judge
mcguire's
decision
was
filed
and
was
denied
by
judge
mcguire.
and
then
a
motion
to
--
for
access
to
the
transcript
was
also
made,
which
came
up
in
a
certain
bundle
of
confusion
as
the
transcript
shows
and
before
judge
holtzoff.
and
it
was
on
that
occasion
in
addition
to
denying
the
access
to
the
transcript.
it
was
on
that
occasion
that
judge
holtzoff
made
the
remarks
which
petitioner
contend
should
have
resulted
in
his
recusing
himself
in
the
trial
of
this
case
and
that
perhaps
this
is
the
best
time
to
advert
to
that
just
briefly.
what
have
had
happened
--
i've
set
this
forth
at
length
in
my
brief.
the
issue
is
when
--
whether
the
remarks
made
by
judge
holtzoff
on
this
case
showed
the
kind
of
prejudice
that
(a)
would
have
made
it
necessary
or
(b)
would
have
made
it
desirable
in
the
interest
of
the
administration
of
justice
for
judge
holtzoff
to
disqualify
himself.
now,
the
motion
--
a
motion
was
made
at
the
outset
of
the
trial
that
judge
holtzoff
to
disqualify
himself.
and
it
was
renewed
right
after
the
jury
has
been
sworn
in
the
opening
have
been
started.
judge
holtzoff
never
allowed
the
grounds
of
the
motion
to
be
stated
on
the
record.
counsel
has
reshowed
in
the
record
and
in
my
brief.
counsel
attempted
to
state
the
grounds.
and
judge
--
for
the
record,
and
judge
holtzoff
said,
“in
my
court,
we
don't
try
cases
for
the
record.
sit
down.”
and
counsel
sat
down.
the
prejudice
complained
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
are
there
what?
mr.
bennett
boskey
there
are
voluminous
records.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
was
a
little
different,
i
think,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
it's
set
forth
at
page
13
of
my
brief
that
the
court
said
that
you
have
already
brought
that
up
at
the
bench
conference.
“i've
disposed
of
the
matter.
you
may
not
bring
it
up
again.
you
may
proceed.
mr.
collins,
for
the
record,
if
i
may
give
the
reasons
to
the
court,
no
you
may
not.
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
when
you
say
for
the
record.
cases
are
tried
before
the
court
and
the
jury.
they
are
not
tried
for
the
record.
you
may
resume
your
sit
sir.”
mr.
bennett
boskey
that's
what
the
colloquy
is.
now,
what
were
the
grounds
on
which
judge
holtzoff
should
have
recused
himself?
the
grounds
were
that
in
the
hearing
on
the
prior
motion
in
referring
to
an
episode
which
had
occurred
during
the
first
trial,
judge
holtzoff
said
he
remembered
the
episode
very
well
where
this
man,
tompkins,
had
refused
to
testify
at
the
first
trial.
he
said
he
was
just
terrorized
by
coppedge.
and
then
he
went
on
when
there
was
call
to
his
attention,
tompkins'
statement
that
he
had
perjured
himself
before
the
grand
jury.
judge
holtzoff
said
he
asserts.
i
imagine
that
statement
was
induced
by
coppedge.
now,
there
wasn't
anything
in
the
record
of
the
prior
trial.
and
there
wasn't
anything
that
ever
occurred
in
the
record
of
this
trial.
it
would
suggest
or
show
that
the
recantation
of
tompkins
was
induced
by
coppedge.
for
the
judge
to
have
such
a
set
conviction
about
the
matter,
before
the
trial
began,
put
petitioner
had
a
serious
disadvantage.
it
put
him
before
a
judge
who
seem
to
have
made
up
his
mind
on
the
truthfulness
or
lack
of
truthfulness
appoints
not
yet
induced
an
evidence,
which
might
or
might
not
be
induced
an
evidence.
he
seem
to
have
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
accept
any
view
petitioner
might
testify
to
in
some
of
these
advantages
if
petitioner
should
elect
to
testify.
and
we
say
that
under
these
circumstances,
judge
holtzoff
should
have
excused
himself.
now,
the
problem
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
not
quite
as
severe
as
it
might
be
in
some
districts
where
this
only
judge.
there
are
many
judges
all
quite
busy
but
there
are
many
judges
in
the
district
of
columbia.
and
when
a
problem
of
this
kind
arises,
it
is
not
a
very
difficult
matter
for
a
judge
to
pass
the
case
on
to
another
judge
for
assignment.
judge
holtzoff's
basic
misconception
here,
i
think
is
disclosed
in
the
part
of
the
transcript
quoted
on
12
--
page
12
as
my
brief.
where
--
when
the
question
was
raised,
he
said,
“i
don't
think
i
have
the
choice
in
the
matter.
it
would
be
unethical
for
me
to
disqualify
myself.”
as
if
he
were
--
would
be
doing
something
improper
to
take
himself
out
of
the
case.
i
think
this
really
comes
down
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
on
the
disqualification
point
that
judge
holtzoff
had
such
a
narrow
view
of
the
duties
and
responsibilities
and
discretion
of
the
judge
in
withdrawing
from
the
case
that
he
exercised
whatever
discretion
he
might
have
had
as
if
there
wasn't
any
discretion.
he
regarded
their
--
the
situation
as
one
in
which
no
discretion
existed
in
which
even
he
was
legally
disqualified
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
covering
affidavits
or
prejudice
or
else.
he
wasn't
disqualified.
and
he
must
sit
because
the
case
have
been
assigned
to
him
surely
isn't
the
law.
mr.
bennett
boskey
not
in
the
abstract.
but
any
says
no
judge
should
ever
disqualify
himself
unless
he
is
legally
disqualified.
then
he
had
just
said
i
don't
think
i
have
the
choice
in
there.
so
taken
in
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
no,
i
--
i
would
argue
differently.
this
is
not
a
case
where
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
let
me
explain.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
let
me
explain.
mr.
bennett
boskey
an
--
if
an
affidavit
of
prejudice
is
filed
which
meets
the
requirement
of
the
statute
as
i
understand
the
statute,
it
is
then
the
judge's
obligation
to
disqualify
himself
whether
the
facts
are
true
or
not,
whether
at
heart
he
feels,
he
let
to
be
disqualified
or
not.
the
statute
gives
him
no
choice.
mr.
bennett
boskey
this
is
not
such
a
case.
the
affidavit
wasn't
filed.
the
affidavit
is
not
the
soul
root
toward
the
judge's
recusing
himself
in
a
case.
what
we
say
is
that
under
all
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
judge
holtzoff
should
have
disqualified
himself.
and
he
was
wrong
in
thinking
he
had
no
choice
from
there.
he
did
have
a
choice.
mr.
bennett
boskey
that
is
certainly
a
large
apart
of
my
point.
mr.
bennett
boskey
in
--
in
the
entirely
in
the
absence
of
an
affidavit.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes.
mr.
bennett
boskey
so,
i
understand
what
you
said
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
actually
i
carried
on
this
point
longer
than
i
expected
to.
we
have
a
very
substantial
evidence
point
in
the
case
which
they're
almost
just
not
time
to
elaborate
orally.
it
involves
the
problem
of
the
unavailable
witnesses
second
trial
is
testified
in
the
first
trial.
there
was
a
witness
in
this
case
that
--
weak
--
man
of
probably
low
intelligence
as
his
testimony
at
the
first
trial
shows.
a
witness
who
had
implicated
petitioner
most
seriously
at
the
first
trial
who
at
the
time
of
the
second
trial
had
become
subject
to
such
a
series
of
illnesses
that
he
was
not
unavailable
--
was
not
available
and
actually
perhaps
was
on
the
virtue
of
death.
he
had
a
mental
condition.
he
had
leukemia
and
various
other
things.
so,
the
government
came
in
and
said
we
want
to
read
his
testimony
that
was
given
at
the
first
trial.
there
is
any
question
of
the
seriousness
of
the
testimony
in
--
in
pinning
the
crime
on
to
this
petitioner
the
jury
believed
the
testimony.
and
petitioner's
trial
council
made
recently
valued
effort
to
persuade
judge
holtzoff
not
to
admit
the
testimony.
and
he
offered
many
reasons.
one
was
that
there
was
a
recantation
statement
filed
this
very
witness
saying
giving
a
version
of
the
event
that
exculpated
instead
of
implicated
petitioner.
and
in
view
of
that,
he
said
the
testimony
was
clearly
unreliable.
another
wise
that
if
now
appeared
from
the
kind
of
schizophrenia
diagnosis
that
had
been
reported
that
this
witness
artist
now
had
schizophrenia.
that
was
an
illness
started
some
time
ago
and
very
possibly
affected
by
this
even
at
the
time
of
the
first
trial.
another
wise
that
during
the
course
of
the
first
trial,
judge
holtzoff
had
made
some
comments
about
this
witness
that
went
right
to
the
unreliability
point.
he
had
--
he
had
himself
told
the
jury
something
about
artist's
unreliability.
and
in
addition
to
that,
in
a
colloquy
with
counsel,
which
appears
in
the
record
at
the
first
trial,
he
has
said
this
prosecutor.
now,
maybe
i
can
save
a
lot
of
time
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
how
much
would
you
going
to
rely
on
artist's
testimony
because
i
want
to
tell
you
right
now
that
there
isn't
any
judge
who
would
send
the
man
on
the
penitentiary
on
the
basis
of
artist's
testimony.
that's
in
the
record
of
the
first
trial
so
that
there
were
surrounding
this
event.
there
were
all
the
hallmarks
of
unreliability.
you
have
a
problem
of
confrontation.
it
is
true
that
this
court
has
said
and
most
courts
have
said
that
the
constitutional
requirement
of
confrontation
is
met
if
in
a
second
trial,
the
unavailable
witnesses'
testimony
is
brought
forward
and
read
provided
he
had
testified
as
the
witness
at
the
first
trial
and
there
had
been
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
there's
nothing
in
the
cases
that
i
have
been
able
to
find.
it
says
that
there
is
any
absolute
right
on
the
part
of
the
government
introduced
this
testimony.
and
i
must
say,
i've
never
found
a
case
that
had
so
many
hallmarks
of
unreliability
detaching
to
the
testimony
as
appeared
in
this
case.
nevertheless,
judge
holtzoff,
and
here
we
come
back
again
to
this
problem
of
absolutes
versus
discretion.
judge
holtzoff
said,
“i
don't
think
i
have
any
discretion
in
the
matter.”
he
testified
before
i
must.
the
government
has
a
right
to
introduce
his
testimony
and
after
many
pages
of
colloquy,
he
uttered
objection
admitted
the
testimony.
not
--
not
only
did
he
admit
the
testimony
but
the
efforts
which
the
defense
made
to
show
that
the
testimony
was
rendered
unreliable
by
other
extraneous
items
of
evidence
were
rejected.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
they
call
it
the
principal
colloquy.
mr.
bennett
boskey
excuse
me.
against
the
what?
mr.
bennett
boskey
alright.
the
principal
colloquy
is
relating
to
this
appear
at
pages
--
what
are
here
--
pages
90
to
97
of
the
printed
record
in
this
court.
they
are
not
so
references
and
others
appear
in
my
brief.
mr.
bennett
boskey
in
addition
to
the
surrounding
fact,
what
was
the
new
evidence?
mr.
bennett
boskey
there
were
two
things,
mr.
justice
black.
the
first
was
a
statement,
which
is
reproduced
at
page
22
of
the
printed
record
here,
signed
in
two
places
by
artist
which
is
entitled
“united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia”
and
which
purports
to
be
a
statement
made
to
clear
my
own
conscience
and
for
the
benefit
of
clearing
my
conscience
and
which
says
“i
had
no
connection
with
any
of
the
other
defendants
in
this
case.”
the
only
one
he
says
he
had
a
connection
with
this
one
named
quinsey
--
a
man
named
“quincy
mccall”.
mr.
bennett
boskey
this
is
directly
contrary
to
the
testimony.
mr.
bennett
boskey
this
is
--
trial
counsel
offered
a
recantation
statement.
it
is
not
notarized.
so,
i
cannot
say
there's
an
affidavit.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
is
signed
in
two
places.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
reports
to
be
signed
by
adam
artist.
the
judge
said
when
he
first
saw
this
turned
it
over
to
the
fbi
for
handwriting
comparison.
and
petitioner's
counsel
said
certainly
turned
it
over
to
them
for
handwriting
comparison.
he
said,
“i've
already
looked
at
the
handwriting
because
it
signed
in
two
places.
and
we
have
artist's
signature
on
some
of
the
money
orders
in
this
case.
and
it
looks
genuine
to
me
but
i'll
give
it
to
the
fbi.
let
them
look
at
it.
mr.
bennett
boskey
that
was
rejected
in
--
and
on
a
series
of
colloquies
beginning
on
page
90
and
ending
on
page
97.
and
as
you'll
see
in
my
replied
brief,
the
government
in
its
brief
says,
well,
maybe
they
didn't
really
want
to
introduce
this
thing
at
the
trial.
mr.
bennett
boskey
the
final
ground
of
rejection,
although
various
other
things
were
stated.
the
final
ground
of
--
of
rejection
with
judge
holtzoff's
statement
that
“i
will
not
admit
it
because
it
is
not
in
his
handwriting.”
you
see,
only
the
signatures
were
in
his
handwriting
and
the
rest
was
in
the
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
that
statement
appears
at
page
97,
at
the
top,
“i
am
not
going
to
admit
it
in
due
the
fact
that
it
is
not
in
his
handwriting.
and
judge
holtzoff
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
holtzoff
said
that
the
rest
of
it
appeared
to
be
in
the
writing
of
some
other
gentleman
who
was
an
inmate
of
the
penitentiary
from
whom
he
got
frequent
document.
mr.
bennett
boskey
some
brief
reference
was
made
to
that
in
passing.
i
do
not
see
how
it
could
affect
the
legal
admissibility
of
that.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
would
be
a
matter
of
wait
for
the
jury
and--
mr.
bennett
boskey
plainly
contradictory.
mr.
bennett
boskey
and
judge
holtzoff
four
times
in
this
colloquy
said
he
would
not
admit
it
in
evidence
and
the
government
yet
says
it
isn't
clear
that
the
petitioner
really
wanted
to
get
it
in.
now,
in
any
courtroom,
four
times
probably
exceeds
by
two
the
limited
times
you
can
urge
a
judge
to
receive
an
exhibit
he
has
refused
to
receive.
in
this
case,
pretty
vigorous
effort
was
made.
there
was
other
evidence
also
rejected
and
effort
was
made
to
bring
in
the
testimony
of
a
man
named
“bush”,
another
inmate
of
lorton
that
on
--
at
a
certain
time
things
possibly
here
was
an
error
as
for
the
date
but
in
anyway
rate,
he
said
he
was
in
the
cell
at
lorton
with
both
artist
and
petitioner
and
he
heard
artist
make
some
statements
about
this
case.
and
an
effort
was
made
then
through
this
witness
to
introduce
those
statements
the
extent
that
there
would
be
in
direct
contradiction
of
artist's
testimony.
judge
holtzoff
said,
“i
was
not
going
to
listen
to
argument
on
this”.
he
said,
“you
can't
introduce
those
statements
because
there's
been
no
opportunity
to
cross-examine
artist's
sworn”.
and
they
went
on.
so,
that
--
that
was
the
other
evidence
mr.
justice
balck.
now,
we
have
in
the
case
many
other
points,
which
obviously
there
isn't
time
to
develop
on
oral
argument.
there
are
points
about
what
the
rules
should
be
for
the
corroboration
of
accomplice
testimony
that
not
are
fully
developed
in
the
brief.
there
is
a
point
about
in
connection
again
with
artist
matter
about
the
government's
failing
to
produce
the
original
of
the
document
which
it
was
required
to
produce
under
the
(inaudible).
there
are
points
about
the
charge,
which
i
think
are
adequately
developed
in
the
brief.
and
there
are
points
also
about
the
prejudicial
comments
of
the
prosecutor
in
expressing
his
own
opinions
on
who
was
telling
the
truth
and
who
wasn't
telling
the
truth.
something
that
i
think
is
prohibited
by
the
counts
of
ethics.
and
it's
a
matter
of
how
you
read
what
he
said.
the
government
said
that
it
was
just
fair
comment
on
the
evidence.
we
say
that
the
proper
reading
of
it
shows
that
it
went
partly
on
that
and
expressed
to
the
jury
his
own
personal
belief
and
the
truthfulness
of
the
fbi
agent,
which
is
a
very
different
thing
from
just
saying
the
evidence
showed
that
the
fbi
agent
testified
such.
well,
the
two
or
so
minutes
remaining,
i'll
save
for
it
by.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes.
the
sentence
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
the
change
has
to
do
with
how
this
is
handled
in
the
district
court.
mr.
bennett
boskey
its
certainly
one
of
the
important
place.
mr.
murray,
who
is
the
director
of
the
legal
aid
agency
established
by
the
congress,
tells
me
that
now,
the
attorneys
whom
they
assigned
the
cases
do
discuss
with
defendants
the
problem
of
what
time
of
the
submission
to
make
to
the
trial
judge.
and
he
says
where
they
get
outside
attorneys
to
agree
to
serve
in
these
cases
--
in
the
trial
cases.
they
also
recommend
the
outside
attorney
that
he
discussed
with
the
defendant
in
the
preparation
of
any
such
paper
to
the
trial
judge.
now,
i
don't
know
how
the
system
is
actually
working
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
the
submission
of
an
application
to
the
trial
judge
believed
to
proceed
an
in
forma
pauperis.
mr.
bennett
boskey
the
kind
of
questions
in
my
feel
normally
deal
with
what
are
the
questions
you're
going
to
read
on
appeal.
mr.
bennett
boskey
this
is
after
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
no,
i
--
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i'm
sorry.
it's
a
hoax.
i
have
the
hoax
but
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
i
think
it
couldn't
be
justified
in
drawing
the
inference
first.
the
statute
creating
this
agency
does
not
give
any
jurisdiction
over
the
representation
of
indigent
that's
on
appeal.
it
is
confined
in
a
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
that's
first.
second,
the
appropriations
for
this
agency
have
been
so
negative
that
the
agency
hasn't
been
able
to
hire
a
staff
to
do
the
kind
of
job
that
they
are
ought
to
do
in
that
(inaudible)
murray.
third,
it
isn't
clear
yet
what
the
initial
efforts
are
doing
in
the
way
of
working
some
of
reforms.
we
all
hope
they
were.
mr.
bennett
boskey
to
the
trial
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
think
it
maybe
--
i
think
it
is
probably
outside
the
responsibility
that
something
intuitively
is
helping
to
improve.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
--
but
--
and
maybe
that
they
can
do
something
about
improving.
mr.
bennett
boskey
that's
the
hope
we
all
share.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
it's
not
just
the
quality
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
bennett
boskey
but
their
perception
of
what
this
court
really
means
in
the
ellis
and
that's
what
they
don't
understand.
mr.
bennett
boskey
that's
a
tremendous
number
of
cases.
mr.
bennett
boskey
now,
many
of
them
are
2255
cases
which
have
a
different
kettle
of
fish
because
i
would
say
far
more
of
those
are
in
fact
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
think
there
are
ways
of
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
i
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
think,
in
fact,
your
honor,
that
if
that
were
done,
this
system
would
work
more
economically.
it
would
save
the
time
of
the
judges.
it
would
save
the
time
of
the
bar.
mr.
bennett
boskey
there
--
there
is
indeed
and
--
and
while
that
statute
is
on
the
books,
i
think
it
behooves
all
of
us
to
see
if
there
is
not
some
way
of
applying
a
statute
sensibly
so
that
it
doesn't
cripple
the
courts
and
cripple
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
way
that
it
is
now
happening.
mr.
bennett
boskey
he
may
not
be
required
automatically
the
grant
of
certificate
but
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
but
he
--
he
ought
to
be
given
some
increased
understanding
and
appreciation
of
the
criteria
involved.
and
i
feel
that
there
are
hopes
for
passing
on
that
kind
of
understanding.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
i
appreciate
the
compliment.
i
hope
that
that
isn't
just
what
i've
done
here
because
the
questions
in
this
case
aren't
working
cases.
mr.
bennett
boskey
and
they
deserve
attention.
mr.
bennett
boskey
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bennett
boskey
thank
you.
mr.
bennett
boskey
mr.
chief
justice
to
take
the
last
point
first,
this
court
many
times
has
commented
on
the
difficulty
of
seeing
something
from
a
cold
record.
now,
in
a
criminal
case,
when
you
read
the
cold
testimony
from
a
prior
trial
to
the
jury,
all
those
difficulties
are
present.
this
judge
had
been
present
in
the
courtroom.
this
judge
had
seen
the
demeanor
of
the
witness.
this
judge
had
formed
an
impression
very
unfavorable
to
the
witness
and
that
--
that
it's
highly
prejudicial
to
this
petitioner
that
the
judge's
impression
not
be
given
to
the
jury
if
this
testimony
was
to
be
admitted
at
all.
mr.
bennett
boskey
mr.
justice
whittaker,
it
depends,
i
think,
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
in
this
case,
where
the
judge
was
the
same,
where
safeguards
were
essential
to
protect
the
right
of
confrontation,
where
the
hallmarks
of
lying
was
so
apparent
and
untrustworthy,
where
the
judge
had
formed
such
a
fixed
impression
from
the
first
trial,
he
fell
short
of
his
duty
and
not
condemning
that
impression
to
the
jury.
now,
it's
conceivable
than
onto
other
circumstances,
in
other
cases
where
these
facts
aren't
present,
one
might
reach
a
different
result.
but
that
isn't
this
case.
this
is
a
most
compelling
case.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i'm
not
answerable
for
what
happens
in
other
criminal
proceeding
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
--
and
other
criminal
fields.
this
is
not
such
a
case
and
the
burden
of
my
argument
has
been
that
this
is
not
such
a
case.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
one
--
one
of
them
he
did
not
make
to
the
jury.
mr.
belcher,
i
think
too
willingly
exceeded
to
chief
justice's
statement
on
that
point.
the
one
in
which
he
said
at
the
first
trial,
“i
wouldn't
send,
no
judge
would
send
this
man
to
the
penitentiary
on
the
basis
this
testimony
was
not
the
statement
made
to
the
jury.”
the
statement
he
made
to
the
jury
at
the
first
trial
was
that
the
witness
was
confused
on
the
witness
stand.
neither
statement
would
he
make
the
jury
in
this
trial
even
though
expressly
by
counsel
and
even
though
in
this
far
the
specific
said
references
of
the
transcript
of
the
first
trial
where
he
had
made
the
remarks
were
brought
to
his
attention.
there
was
nothing
inadvertent
about
this.
it
was
expressly
brought
to
his
attention.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
was
made
in
a
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
was
made
in
connection
with
a
colloquy
with
counsel
when
i
think
the
judge
was
trying
to
speed
up
the
trial
of
the
first
case
a
little.
he
thought
it
was
going
slowly
and
he
was
trying
to
find
out
how
much
the
government
was
really
going
to
rely
on
in
artis'
testimony
in
the
first
trial.
mr.
bennett
boskey
oh
yes.
mr.
bennett
boskey
in
the
course
of
the
trial
after
he
have
heard
the
witness.
mr.
bennett
boskey
because
he
was
trying
to
move
the
trial
on
and
it's
in
the
record,
there
isn't
any
question
that
he
said.
mr.
bennett
boskey
the
other
within
his
instruction
to
the
jury
at
the
case
trial.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
think
a
considerable
leeway
and
i
think
also
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
think
a
considerable
leeway
that
in
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
he
had
a
very
special
kind
problem
that
doesn't
arise
very
often
about
the
unavailable
witness.
so
he
--
he
personally
knew
he
is
not
a
good
witness.
and
he
didn't
do
a
thing
to
protect
the
defendant's
rights
here
even
tough
repeatedly
asked.
oh
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
have
one
more
thing
i
did
want
to
say.
mr.
bennett
boskey
the
point
question
was
raise,
i
think,
during
mr.
belcher's
argument
concerning
whether
all
these
are
questions
of
local
law
and
i
would
say
in
response
for
that
that
most
of
them
are
not
questions
of
local
law
at
all.
if
you
look
at
the
table
of
contents
of
this
brief,
you'll
see
that
the
grand
jury
points
are
not
points
of
the
local
law
at
all.
the
evidence
points
are
largely
points
not
of
local
law
with
some,
i
would
admit,
had
mixture
of
local
law.
but
at
the
same
time,
they
stem
out
of
decisions
of
this
court,
which
i
think
have
gotten
the
law
of
--
on
the
wrong
track.
the
mattox
--
old
mattox's
decision
in
156
u.s.
which
mr.
belcher
i
think
in
response
to
justice
whittaker's
decision
said
the
government
supports
that
decision.
the
fact
is
the
government
doesn't
say
a
word
in
its
brief
in
support
of
that
decision.
and
if
that's
the
government
position,
it
hasn't
given
the
court
the
slightest
help
on
why
there's
any
rationality
on
that.
and
in
my
brief,
i
said
that
the
dissent
of
the
mattox
case
is
correct.
i
say
that
furthermore
that
the
uniform
rules
of
evidence
bears
out
on
that
the
--
which
had
been
approved
by
the
national
conference
and
commissioners
on
uniform
state
laws
by
the
american
bar
association
and
by
the
american
law
institute.
and
specifically
mr.
justice
whittaker,
in
answer
to
the
question
you
have
raised,
why
under
what
circumstances
this
document
could
have
been
admissible
anyway.
rule
65
of
the
uniform
rules
of
evidence
cited
in
reply
brief
is
clear
and
explicit.
it's
dealing
with
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule
and
first
trial
testimony
is
such
an
exception.
and
it
says,
“evidence
of
the
statements
or
other
conduct
by
a
declarant
inconsistent,
with
a
statement
received
in
that
evidence
under
exception
to
rule
63,
is
admissible
for
the
purpose
of
discrediting
the
declarant
though
he
had
no
opportunity
to
deny
or
explain
such
inconsistent
statement”
and
it
says
this
is
the
modern
rule
in
the
comment
accompanied.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
think
it
is
clearly
applicable
that
if
they
wanted
to
go
ahead
with
the
fbi
check
of
the
handwriting,
counsel
give
them
every
opportunity
to
had
any
other
effort
in
one
--
have
wanted
to
make
any
other
effort
to
check
the
source
of
the
statement
it
could
easily
have
been
done,
but
that
was
cut
off
because
four
times,
judge
holtzoff
said,
“i
won't
admit
it.”
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
i
would
have
wanted
to
submit
an
argument
more
on
the
merits
on
the
grand
jury
point
where
i
have
said
in
my
memorandum
several
times
that
it
was
clear,
i
had
a
substantial
question
that
the
development
of
it
could
have
wait
the
argument
on
the
merits
and
the
briefs
on
the
merit.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes
and
there
were
the
things
i
would
have
wanted
to
do.
mr.
belcher
said
counsel
had
come
to
grips
on
all
the
points.
the
government
never
dealt
with
two
of
these
points
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
corroboration
point
came
up
afterwards.
it
was
in
my
memorandum
to
which
the
government
never
filed
a
reply.
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
never
dealt
with
the
point
relating
to
views
or
comments
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
shall
be
glad
to,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
he's
been
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
designate
a
record
which
would
be
on
orderly
record
on
appeal.
you
can't
do
that
until
you
get
an
order
allowing
you
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
because
the
district
court
won't
receive
your
designation
and
send
the
record
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
does
that
matter
or
doesn't?
there
are
some
cases
where
you
have
a
very
simple
record,
it
won't
matter.
the
government
says
in
the
footnote
what
doesn't
matter
because
the
court
of
appeals
goes
and
gets
the
record
anyway.
well,
i've
seen
some
of
the
records
they
get,
i
don't
what
they
do
with
them,
but
there
are
bundles
of
papers.
they
are
full
of
subpoenas
and
other
irrelevant
documents.
there's
been
no
effort
made
at
that
stage
to
sort
them
out,
designate
them,
and
put
before
the
court
of
appeals
where
they
ought
to
be
there,
that's
just
the
beginning.
second,
we
were
deprived,
as
we
made
clear
of
the
full
briefing
on
the
merits.
now,
it's
true
there
are
two
preliminary
memorandums
here,
neither
was
to
be
conclusive,
neither
involves
the
development
of
these
points
as
they
should
have
been
developed
in
the
full
brief
on
the
merits,
although
steps
were
made
in
that
direction.
i
might
say,
if
counsels
feel
that
they
are
under
a
burden
to
write
full
brief
at
a
preliminary
stage
it
seems
to
me
a
very
difficult
burden
to
impose
on
counsels
and
directly
contrary
to
what
ellis
says
which
is
the
no
preliminary
showing
of
merits
required.
third,
we
were
deprived
of
full
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
fact
we
were
deprived
all
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals.
this
motion,
as
i
think
it's
now
become
quite
customary
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
not
put
on
the
argument
calendar.
so
we
never
had
our
argument
on
the
court
of
appeals.
we
never
came
to
grips
with
the
judges
who
were
passing
on
the
case.
we
didn't
know
how
they
where
looking
at
the
documents.
what
was
on
their
minds?
what
kind
of
a
case
we
can
make
to
it?
fourth,
we
were
deprived
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
don't
know
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided.
we
don't
know
what
they
considered.
we
don't
how
they
considered
it.
we
don't
know
whether
they
considered
it
in
concert
or
singling.
that
is
not
the
treatment
which
have
(inaudible)
appeal
gets
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that's
what
we
are
entitled
to.
so
that
if
after
all
of
that
and
we
had
that
kind
of
treatment
on
the
merits,
we
then
wanted
to
file
a
petition
for
certiorari.
this
court
then
wouldn't
have
had
any
difficulty
knowing
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
and
hadn't
done.
