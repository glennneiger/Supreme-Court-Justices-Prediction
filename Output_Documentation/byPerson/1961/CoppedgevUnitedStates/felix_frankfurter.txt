justice

mr.
bennett
--
mr.
boskey
do
you
have
your
reference
to
the
many
cases
that
have
come
up
at
this
sort?
have
you
gotten
it
begins
even
if
not
accurate
one
to
make
sure
the
magnitude
of
cases
go
up
that
are
sought
to
be
brought
from
a
conviction
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
informal
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
exclusively
in
the
district.
is
that
the
special
problem
with
that
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
roughly,
what
range
of
value
this
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
--
i
mean
distinguishing
in
which
the
district
court
refuses
to
give
us
certificate
you're
indicate
convicted.
they
are
substantial,
aren't
they
mr.
boskey?
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
do
me
(inaudible).
so
what
year
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1960?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
after
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
those
180?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
have
you
--
are
there
figures
as
to
the
number
that
have
been
--
that
are
applied
before
--
certificate
applied
for
in
the
district
court
denied
by
the
district
judge
--
court
judges
and
drop
of
further
move
made
to
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
substantial
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
no
annual
statistical
report
for
the
court
of
appeal
for
the
district
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
general
judicial
business.
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
vague
mr.
boskey
are
you
well-known
but
i
take
that
you
were
not
so
comfortable
that
the
fact
that
courts
of
appeal
or
for
the
matter
of
my
point
of
view
as
this
court
isn't
it
more
robust
in
dismissing
appeals
as
frivolous
in
vague
counsel
cases?
you
are
just
going
to
make
that
statement
from
a
mathematical
embarrassment
to
sit
down
and
denying.
i'll
show
you
a
proof
of
equal
denial
of
these
executives
alone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more
that's
why
put
in
the
word
that's
why
i
passed
right
the
court
is
not
being
adequate
be
robust
in
dismissing
frivolous
appeal
even
though
(inaudible)
appear
before
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
i
ought
to
have
mr.
boskey,
the
pre
consul
for
appellee
should
be
more
of
robust.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
are
the
great
deal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
have
any
idea
mr.
boskey
is
really
a
way
to
hit
the
note
just
likes
me
that
this
cumbersome
procedure
there
as
much
me
in
giving
the
one
of
these
forma
pauperis
patience
of
much
more
time
and
retention
in
the
way
of
judicial
manpower
and
everything
else
then
is
given
to
the
appellate
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
due
process,
we
let
your
--
be
found
at
your
argument
that
--
mr.
justice
--
just
mr.
justice
brennan
points
out
the
difference
in
responsibility
between
not
being
able
at
justice
--
would
do
it
for
just
not
being
able
to
determine
issues
of
revolving
and
that's
the
matter
count
before
the
court
and
having
the
positive
responsibility
of
paying
out
government
money
and
time
in
hearing
for
this
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
really
a
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
that
the
very
point,
mr.
boskey
in
terms
of
paying
out
government
money
and
time,
much
more
squander
done
under
this
procedure
than
this
is
required
and
in
the
case
of
appellate
review?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
also
talking
about
bloated
dockets.
there's
no
better
way
of
bloating
the
docket
then
have
the
frivolous
subpoenas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
that
--
that's
what
i
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
lorton
reform
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
what
--
what's
the
nature
of
the
penal
institution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
old
is
this
petition
is
valid?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
reformatory
is
a
misleading
firm?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
open
and
all
around.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
--
maybe
i
should
go
and
visit
the
penal
institution
in
this
neighborhood.
justice
felix
frankfurter
made
at
the
second
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay.
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
was
it
paid?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
passed
on
the
merit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
tell
us
what
tompkins
stated
the
position
of
relation
was
at
the
time
of
the
recanting
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
at
the
time
of
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
he
was
awaiting
disposition
of
the
charge
against
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
a
codefendant.
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury
before
he
was
indict.
he
was
a
called
suspect
at
the
stage.
i
think
he
was
a
suspect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
test
--
he
testified
against
the
alleged
partner
in
crime
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
implicated
petitioner.
subsequently,
he
was
indicted
and
convicted
and
he's
in
jail
announced
what
he
said
before
the
grand
jury
was
a
fact
of
lie.
uttered
because
of
expected
favor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
--
did
judge
mcguire
--
i'm
sorry
i'm
a
little
confused.
did
judge
mcguire
passed
and
reject
this
motion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
rightly
that
judge
holtzoff
presided
in
both?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
didn't
just
as
a
matter
interesting
in
the
administration
of
justice
into
this
case,
why
--
why
shouldn't
a
motion
on
the
indictment
attacking
the
affirmative
the
indictment
have
gone
to
judge
holtzoff?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
getting
the
cause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
tell
me
i'm
sure
whether
the
practice
in
this
district
that
matters
depending
for
a
single
case
are
already
third
subject
to
injure
witness,
accepted
the
--
accepted
the
--
the
same
judge.
is
that
the
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
wouldn't
say
that
you
always
have
to
have
a
oral
hearing.
and
this
was
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
said
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
going
to
be
on
the
need
of
your
case?
i
think
you
do
not
have
to
say
that
affidavits
are
ruled
out
here
after
un-american
proceedings
of
this
kind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
just
said
that
you
have
the
witness
is
available
and
that
you
could
have
put
him
on
the
stand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
weren't
used
here
because
of
judge
went
on
some
legal
consideration
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
which
that
he
examined
the
grand
jury
minutes.
he
excised
all
the
issue
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
was
not
enough
evidence
left
any
anyway.
the
conception
of
the
grand
jury
as
a
charging
body
and
the
relation
of
the
grand
jury
justice
whittaker
pointed
out
that
one
of
those
in
the
trial
court.
i'm
not
saying
his
wrong.
i
think
his
right.
and
i
think
i
agree
with
it.
all
i'm
saying
that
your
suggestion
if
there
were
oral
witnesses
available
is
not
sufficiently
circumscribing
from
my
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
did
you
argue
this
case
although
it
was
before
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
it
was
on
you
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
the
justices
in
your
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
--
the
--
what
you
said
a
minute
ago
namely
that
trial
counsel
that
he
like
to
see
the
grand
jury
minute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
really,
he
made
a
motion.
was
this
before
judge
mcguire
handed
down
his
memorandum
or
after
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
said
something
that
interests
me
very
much
namely,
ex-party
practice
in
the
but
of
prosecutor.
how
does
the
grand
jury
minute
get
to
judge
mcguire?
or
this
--
just
tell
me
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
counsel
was
counsel
of
the
corpus
government
has
declaimed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you'd
been
there,
i'm
sure
you
would
not
sit
down
like
with
those
means
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
quite
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
about
on
the
appellee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
issue
come
before
judge
holtzoff?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
with
the
view
to
off
real
indication
determined
by
justice
mcguire?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
record
in
that
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
record
in
that
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
no
offense
to
judge
holtzoff.
that
is
what
he
said.
it
is
unethical
for
a
judge
to
decline
the
trial
case
because
it
is
unpleasant.
and
he
imposed
an
extra
burden
to
some
other
judge.
he
wouldn't
use
affidavit
that
after
they
taken
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
it's
an
affidavit
of
disqualification,
court
not
to
be
granted
by
a
judge
and
any
other
choice
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
argue?
this
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
my
--
take
my
--
be
sure
you
--
that
i
stated
what
i
wanted
to
state.
if
an
affidavit
of
disqualification
under
the
construction
by
this
court
of
that
statute
should
not
leave
the
judge.
does
not
call
for
taking
himself
out
of
the
case
then
i
think
i
would
--
i
might
not
use
the
word
probably
worth.
and
it
is
unethical
because
of
ease
or
prudence
or
comfort
or
a
politically
dioramic
sense
of
--
of
conscience
to
take
himself
out
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
said
all
this
as
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
but
--
but
the
reverse
of
justice
harlan
says,
of
course,
if
he
says
i
can
search
my
conscience
and
such
a
self-righteous
feature
that
i
don't
have
to
examine
the
--
all
the
complexity
of
mystery
to
the
human
mind
and
conscience
at
another
thing
but
if
having
done
that,
he's
clear
in
his
mind
that
it
is
duty
to
sit
and
not
as
the
matter
of
choice
to
recuse
himself.
i'm
not
saying
the
facts
are
--
within
or
without
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
no
point
was
made
of
the
fact
that
it
was
notarized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
i
hope
about
taking
your
time
asking
this.
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument,
mr.
boskey,
you
said
you
thought
that
within
the
last
month,
if
i
recall
correctly,
in
view
of
the
congressional
legislation
giving
the
legal
aid
in
the
district
that
the
changes
and
since
this
problem
isn't
just
one
case
but
a
system.
would
you
mind
telling
us
more
of
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
that's
what
the
important
place,
if
i
may
say
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
question
is
to
be
raised?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
go
inference
in
what
you
said
that
the
important
thing
is
that
there
is
no
general
oversight
by
some
responsible
body
of
--
of
the
position
of
the
indigent
defendant
not
in
a
particular
case
but
more
pervasively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
i
write
that
letter
hoax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
talking
about
still
restricting
it
to
the
discharge
trial
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
boskey,
the
reason
that
i
had
hoped
is
that
the
right
for
my
appealing
that
if
the
district
court
--
if
district
judges
are
more
alike
to
the
nature
of
the
problem,
then
they
would
shut
off
the
refusal
and
we
do
not
have
to
go
upstairs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
and
that
depends
as
the
most
of
these
things
depend
on
the
quality
of
the
judges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
say
just.
that's
the
most
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
we
do
know
that
on
your
figures
a
district
judge
is
actually
shed
off
at
least
a
180
degrees,
i
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
with
one
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
mr.
boskey,
it
isn't
what
this
court
need.
but
justice
brennan
suggested.
you
would
think
that
there
is
--
the
content
of
their
mind
would
be
different
from
this
court
knows
is
effort
--
and
we
mean
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
depends.
it
dep
--
we
can
say
that
or
can
say
the
same
thing
in
--
in
three
pages
or
30
pages.
it
depends
on
the
attitude
and
understanding
and
perhaps
the
pressure
or
the
absence
of
pressure
of
time
on
the
bottom
district
judges
no
matter
how
it
can
be
saved.
the
conscience
this
judge
will
face
that
a
point
is
frivolous.
he
will
so
determine
which
raises
the
question
that
you
haven't
discussed
at
all.
in
my
point
of
view,
i
could
use
the
deal
or
have
this
canvass
for
the
next
two
hours.
you
don't
tolerate
the
question
whether
the
odd
in
the
answers
automatically
grant
appeal
in
every
indigent
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
what
it
gets
the
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
depends
on
the
statute
of
congress
also
to
be
respected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
those
are
a
lot
of
words.
but
does
it
get
down
to
that
a
district
judge
who
doesn't
want
to
be
in
adverse
will
automatically
grants
a
certificate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
only
psychologically
do
it
automatically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
isn't
--
there
is
no
law
of
durability
who
can't
make
every
--
every
question
that's
raised
in
a
criminal
case
appears
important
with
respect
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
quite
agree
with
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody
wants
--
nobody
wants
it
so
then
i.
this
is
a
very
serious
problem
but
you
can
find
it
at
the
memo
as
i
am
that
you
--
you
have
a
different
job,
i
am
whether
the
answer
is
to
say
in
effect
or
have
a
--
have
a
say
something
which
in
effect
will
make
every
district
judge
automatically
grant
the
certificate
and
chloroform(ph)
an
act
of
congress
--
a
constitutional
act
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
belcher,
this
court
at
least
have
--
by
way
of
assumption
though
contingently,
better
word,
contingently,
we
will
have
to
consider
the
merits
of
the
questions
raised
by
mr.
boskey.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can't
escape.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nor
in
order
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
method?
i
mean
--
i
mean
the
--
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
points
that
he
urges
by
which
he
--
on
the
basis
of
which
he
was
disallowed
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
are
of
a
quality
legal
solidity
as
to
be
called
frivolous
and
that
means
at
least
on
the
surface,
under
the
--
the
law
that
surfaced
considering
the
merits
of
this
question.
i'm
not
going
beyond
that.
i'm
--
that
doesn't
mean
we
should
actually
decide
with
what
you
say.
we
do
have
to
say
that
there's
a
specific
gravity
and
--
and
that
thing
on
the
specific
gravity
of
these
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
it
--
does
a
good
reason
for
not
deciding
them,
any
of
the
certainly
evidentiary
questions
that
one
would
have
to
decide
whether
this,
in
the
first
place,
what
is
their
universal
--
like
well
there
is
but
--
but
i
don't
know.
one
have
to
decide
whether
they
are
local
questions
govern
by
local
law
and
if
they
are
certain
to
this
court,
would
embark
on
search
inquiries
and
not
the
testing
any
of
these
questions
are.
i
don't
know.
but
the
determination
of
whether
they
are
or
not
in
itself
a
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
court
has
again
and
again
and
hardly
anything.
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
matter
of
plea
or
bargain
cases
as
--
as
this
court
of
conflict
has
in
effect
on
local
district
court
of
columbia.
question
local.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
question
whether
--
whether
the
testimony
--
to
my
testimony
in
the
first
try
should
be
read
then
in
the
sentence
that
surely
a
local
question
for
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
invoked
in
the
same
statement.
they
may
have
their
oath
to
do
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
don't
quite
understand
the
suggestion.
that's
just
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
criminal
conviction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
different
view
between
informant
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
all
informant?
are
these
43
all
informants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
but
in
forma
pauperis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
soon
as
apparent,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--they'd
have
--
if
they
are
the
informers,
they
must
have
granted
the
right
to
appeal.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
were
43
such?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
got
a
figure
of
the
remand
confused.
i
thought
mr.
boskey
gave
us
a
figure
that
out
of
180
applications,
only
28
were
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
different
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
23
and
28
is
substantial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
collateral
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
the
size
of
the
number
of
28.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
weren't
there?
is
they
were
--
the
43
were
appeals
to
be
merged
by
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
13
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
13.
and
how
many
denied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
15
must
have
been
granted
in
collateral
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
total
is
28
out
of
180,
had
you
break
it
down
as
between
direct
and
collaterals
and
13
direct
were
granted,
that
means
50
collateral
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
60.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
proportionately
--
proportionately,
according
if
you
take
the
gross
figures
of
mr.
boskey,
only
one
intent
a
little
over,
10%
of
the
cases
were
granted
who
has
and
you
take
one
picture
direct
appeal
figures
a
little
less
than
33%
appeal
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
leaves
that
a
substantial
proportion
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
cover
all
prosecutions
on
the
either
title
18
us
code
or
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
all
murders
down
to
at
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
every
kind
of
offence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
(voice
overlap)
in
the
us
attorney's
office
in
the
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
deal,
how
many
assistance
do
the
us
attorney's
office
dealing
with
criminal
trial
matter?
could
you
give
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
do
the
300
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
--
are
those
convictions
after
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
pleas
of
guilty
in
the
district?
do
you
have
in
mind?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
happen
to
know
what
the
potential
burden
statute
is
when
the
congress
certified
the
certification?
well,
that's
--
that's
true
for
us
affecting
it
as
a
matter
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
national
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
will
that
have?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
same
in
ohio,
in
california,
in
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
--
is
there
any
light
you
would
know
as
to
whether,
after
they
pass
on
motion
in
rem
it
comes
to
the
final
decree
or
judgment,
the
final
judgment.
the
judge
who
would
vote
--
who
had
voted
to
grant
the
petition
to
take
the
appeal
just
acquiescence
in
the
judgment
when
the
note
is
--
is
(inaudible)
judgment.
i'm
asking
what
they
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
can't
--
not
what
they
can
do.
i
want
to
know
what
in
fact
is
being
done
in
this
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
my
next
--
my
question
is,
when
it
comes
to
the
formal
final
judgment
that
judge
bazelon
note
that
he
dissented
in
the
formal
decree,
in
the
formal
judgment
which
is
the
judicial
(inaudible)
of
the
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
time,
he
doesn't
(inaudible),
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it's
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
guess
i'm
confusing
you
by
my
obscurity.
i
thought
you've
told
us
that
he
noted
his
dissent
in
the
denial
from
the
motion
to
grant
--
to
take
the
appeal.
he
would
have
granted
the
motion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
told
us
when
it
came
to
the
entry
of
the
judgment
on
that
disposition,
he
did
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
well,
i
misunderstood.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
i
suppose
--
suppose
now
on
suppose
this
is
sent
back,
suppose
mr.
boskey
prevailed
and
sent
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
for
all
i
know,
(inaudible)
may
have
taken
down
mr.
justice
harlan
question
which
he
just
put
to
you
as
a
part
of
elucidation,
i'd
better
assume
that
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
they
unlikely
read,
when
i
say
(inaudible)
and
say,
“well,
let's
wait
to
deal
with
it
in
the
future”,
and
the
only
remedy
open
to
this
court
would
be
say
--
would
be
to
say
that
court
of
appeals
is
evasive
about
that.
and
they
must
have
a
full
dress
further
argument,
further
briefs
(inaudible)
etcetera,
unlike
what
this
court
does
in
dealing
with
icc
and
other
cases
on
jurisdictional
statement
and
disposing
of
it
on
the
jurisdictional
statement,
is
that
right?
did
i
make
a
correct
analysis
of
what
is
likely
to
happen,
or
it
may
happen
i
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
on
the
assumption,
all
in
the
assumption
that
i
followed
what
you've
said,
that
you
say
in
effect,
yes
to
the
question
that
justice
harlan
put
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely,
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
fact
canvassed
this
ground
and
in
taking
this
formula
disposable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
indicated
early
in
your
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
been
responsive
to
this
court's
opinion
in
ellis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
i
wish
you
would
tell
us,
what
if
--
what
its
conception
was
before
ellis
and
what
you
concede
to
be
its
conception
now
after
ellis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
boskey
the
rule
that
invoke
quite
rightly
that
it's
one
thing
to
have
trial,
a
like
trial,
it's
another
thing
to
get
it
and
see
to
cover
this
subject,
brown
paper
book,
that's
(inaudible)
because
what
--
what
it
amounts
to
is
very
often
--
because
i'm
concerned
in
the
criminal
fields
in
most
of
time,
things
have
blown
up
all
out
of
perspective
in
relation
to
the
live
proceeding,
concentrated,
and
give
the
significance
and
color
and
eloquence,
and
form,
that
this
entitles
him
to
undercut
everything
else
to
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
your
not,
but
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
leeway
do
you
think
it's
proper
for
us
or
perhaps
is
unwise
--
i
don't
regard
those
judge
as
my
model
of
(inaudible),
even
an
unwise
judge
telling
the
jury
his
impression
so
long
as
he
doesn't
confine
them
or
encourage
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
and
the
federal
courts,
i
know
what
state
rule
is.
