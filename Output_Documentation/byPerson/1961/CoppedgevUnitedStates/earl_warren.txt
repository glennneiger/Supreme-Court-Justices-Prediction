mr.
boskey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
and
all
of
those
were
denied?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
boskey,
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
if
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
boskey,
may
i
ask
you
if
--
if
you
have
any
figures
on
as
to
how
many
motions
for
dismissal
on
the
grounds
of
frivolity
were
made
in
the
district
court
here
in
regular
case
not
informed
of
paupers
--
paupers
cases
in
--
but
in
the
same
year.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
doing
that
to
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
he
in
--
is
he
in
jail
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
a
claim
that
the
government's
part
is
a
prejudiced?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
did
ask
to
see
the
--
the
minutes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
boskey,
if
there
was
no
affidavit
or
no
suggestion
of
bias
at
all,
if
he
felt
in
his
own
conscience
that
he
couldn't
be
paired
of
the
man
because
he
had
some
kind
of
a
prejudice.
it
would
be
his
duty
to
retire.
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
boskey,
your
time
was
expired
but
in
as
much
as
we've
taken
up
frankly
all
your
time
with
questions
so
you
may
have
five
minutes
in
rebuttal
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you
wish
to
summarize
your
argument.
you
may
have
five
minutes
also,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
belcher.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
get
that
last
end
point
because
he
is
serving
what
i
-
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
thought
counsel
said
he
--
he
started
five
weeks
ago
to
serve
this
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
--
under
this
conviction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
he
is
eligible
to
--
to
apply
for
parole,
under
these
convictions,
he
must
be
serving
--
he
must
be
serving
some
time
under
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.
but
suppose
--
suppose
we
descended
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
end
--
by
the
time
he
should
get
back
here.
he
long
seems
to
serve
these
20
months,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
all
of
the
questions
in
this
case,
local
law
in
the
--
of
the
district
of
columbia?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
is
one
thing
--
one
thing
you
didn't
mention
that
they
have
the
same
right
of
petitioning
here
for
assert
with
the
same
scope
of
review
that
he
would
have.
have
they
considered
his
appeal
and
determine
it
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
--
but
here,
on
this
kind
of
review,
it's
your
contention
isn't
it
that
we're
--
we're
limited
only
to
the
question
as
to
whether
his
--
whether
his
appeal
is
frivolous?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
scope
of
our
review
here
than
its
present
time
in
this
--
in
this
case?
you
--
you
say
that
we
shouldn't
reach
the
merits
of
the
--
of
the
case
and
--
and
if
we
think
that
the
petitioner
is
correct
in
his
--
his
representations
find
him
a
new
trial
because
you
say
that's
a
local
law.
now,
if
this
was
a
paid
case
and
it
had
been
heard
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
merits,
it
would
be
right
for
our
consideration
on
certiorari,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
now,
in
that
--
in
that
sense,
does
--
does
this
man
have
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
rights
and
all
the
remedies
that
another
man
would
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
have
you
explain
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
may
i
ask
this
one
more
question.
you
have
--
you
have
indicated
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
frankfurter
that
the
evidence
requested
is
one
solely
of
local
law.
now,
it's
your
position,
i
think,
that
--
that
even
though
we
--
we
feel
that
--
that
we
should
take
some
action
in
this
case
that
the
limit
of
our
actions
would
--
should
be
to
return
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
direct
them
to
give
the
man
a
hearing,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
but
if
this
man
had
been
--
had
paid
the
fees
and
had
been
a
--
a
regular
appellee,
he
would've
have
a
hearing
and
the
court
would've
decided
that
question
with
local
law.
and
it
would've
come
here
to
us
on
sort.
and
we
could
then
review
the
action
of
the
court
when
it
comes
to
us
in
this
posture
but
we
can't
review
it
in
the
same
way,
can
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
it's
your
position
that
there
is
nothing
of
that
kind
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
belcher
in
the
--
in
the
large
number
of
the
states
and
in
some
of
the
very
largest
states
of
the
union,
there's
an
absolute
right
to
appeal
and
without
the
payment
of
any
fees
of
any
kind
either
for
filing
an
appeal
or
for
--
or
preparing
a
transcript
which
automatic
with
--
with
the
appeal.
may
i
ask
if
in
the
district
of
columbia,
you're
faced
with
any
problems
that
are
greater
than
those
states
are
faced
with?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
many
states
had
have
that
for
generations
as
to
and
i
just
wonder
why
it
would
be
so
such
a
terrible
problem
to
the
district
of
columbia,
if
that
possible
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
speak
to
the
state
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
federal
law.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
belcher,
may
i
trouble
just
one
--
once
more
about
the
procedure.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
do
--
do
these
hearings
such
as
petitioner
got
in
this
case
come
up
on
the
regular
calendar,
and
that
--
do
they
have
the
--
the
same
priorities
and
--
and
the
same
procedures
that
the
cases
on
appeal
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
--
in
other
words,
when
a
man
filed
a
petition
such
as
this,
he
gets
a
hearing
and
the
decision
as
quickly
as
--
as
a
person
would
on
the
appeal
calendar
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
you
get
another
panel
to
decide
that?
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
a
split
decision
on
whether
he
was
entitled
to
appeal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
then
you
say
there
was
another
panel
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
belcher,
i
was
wondering
if
in
this
case
instead
of
--
of
denying
the
appeal
they
had
--
had
granted
it
would
the
same
panel
automatically
hear
the
appeal
or
--
or
would
have
then
go
on
some
other
calendars
subject
to
--
to
assignment
to
--
to
any
panel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
work
that
had
been
done
between
counsel
and
the
--
and
the
court
on
this
special
proceeding
would
probably
be
of
no
avail
because
it
would
go
to
another
conference
and
he
would
have
to
--
counsel
would
have
to
write
briefs
and
and
argue
again
to
the
--
to
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
epitomized
the
same
as
any
other
appeal
then,
wouldn't
it
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
i
see.
but
so
far
as
the
time
and
the
court
is
concerned
and
the
(inaudible)
of
the
court,
it
would
be
just
as
costly
to
the
government
to
have
this
appeal
after
this
hearing
as
it
would
in
an
ordinary
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
if
they
take
--
if
they
come
to
this
court
on
--
on
certiorari,
what
is
open
to
us
to
decide?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
write
--
write
opinions
in
these
matters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
normally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
this
court
know
all
of
the
issues
that
this
court
has
passed
on
and
--
and
how
they
have
passed
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
belcher,
i'm
afraid
we've
taking
too
much
time
on
procedure.
i
wonder
–
i
wonder
if
you
could
get
now
or
soon
through
the
questions
to
whether
--
whether
this
aaren
--
the
issue
on
the
aaren
testimony
is
frivolous
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
reason
for
it?
was
he
mentally
incapacited
--
incapacitated
he
had
a
deteriorated
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
schizophrenic?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
did
offer
that
document?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
--
i'd
like
to
ask
one
more
--
one
more
question
mr.
belcher.
i'm
interested
in
–
in
this
aaren's
testimony
to
this
extent.
the
--
the
authority
that
the
prosecution
has
to
read
the
testimony
of
witness
at
a
former
--
former
trial
is
an
exception
to
the
general
--
general
rule,
and
i
just
wonder
if
there
are
no
circumstances,
where
there
is
no
way
of
testing
the
credibility
of
the
witness
at
the
second
trial,
if
counsel
didn't
have
a
right
to
have
the
judge,
who
was
the
same
judge
trying
the
--
the
second
case
to
insert
in
the
record
the
same
comments
concerning
the
credibility
of
the
witness
that
he
made
at
the
first
trial.
now
at
the
first
trial,
judge
holtzoff
said
that,
he
called
it
very
confusing
so
forth
and
then
he
ended
up
saying
that
no
jury
or
no
judge
would
convict
any
man
on
the
testimony
of
aaren
and
in
the
second
trial,
we
have
just
a
testimony
of
aaren
but
no
such
comment
by
the
judge
and
no
opportunity
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
attack
the
credibility
of
aaren.
do
you
think
that
it's
frivolous
for
--
for
a
defendant
to
insist
on
a
review
that
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
belcher
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
we'll,
you
go
ahead
finish
please
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
but
mr.
belcher,
the
judge
have
the
right
to
view
the
witness
on
the
stand.
he
did
view
the
witness
on
the
stand
saw
the
manner
in
which
he
testified,
his
attitude,
and
so
forth
and
having
seen
that,
he
--
he
said
to
the
jury
in
that
first
case,
that
no
jury
or
no
judge
would
ever
convict
a
man
on
the
testimony
of
--
of
this
fellow.
now,
it
may
not
--
if
--
his
--
his
judgments
might
not
have
been
formed
by
the
precise
words
that
the
man
used
in
answering
the
questions,
it
might
have
been
used
by
his
demeanor
or
his
attitude
and
the
various
other
things
that
can
come
into
consideration,
none
of
which,
none
of
which
the
defendant
could
probe
on
the
second
trial
and
here
you
have
a
man
who
--
who
has
deteriorated
since
the
first
trial
to
such
an
extent
that
he's
in
a
mental
--
mental
hospital
and
do
you
think
it
frivolous
for
the
defendant
to
raise
that
on
his
appeal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
is
an
attorney
for
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he's
the
attorney
for
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
hardly
--
you
can
hardly
equate
that
to
--
to
an
observation
by
the
judge,
could
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
also
follows
that
with
another
instruction
which
is
peculiar
--
somewhat
peculiar
to
the
district
of
columbia
in
which
he
says
that
they
may
if
they
believe
the
accomplices
convicted
defendant
without
any
corroboration
whatsoever.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
boskey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
the
other
statement
made,
mr.
boskey?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
connection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
going
in
the
course
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
statement
of
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
--
do
you
have
one
more
statement
to
make
that
to
--
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
may
raise
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
boskey,
may
--
may
i
ask
you
and
just
to
briefly
recapitulate,
if
you
will,
the
things
that
a
defendant
in
the
position
of
your
petitioner
here
has
been
deprived
of
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
didn't
have
a
--
an
appeal
granted
to
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
