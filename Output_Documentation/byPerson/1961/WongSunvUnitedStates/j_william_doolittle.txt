mr.
j.
william
doolittle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
for
all
the
drama
of
this
case
some
of
it
quite
real,
some
of
it
less
clearly
so,
it
is
easy
to
lose
sight
of
the
precise
questions
involved.
petitioners'
primary
contentions
are
two
in
number.
first,
that
most
of
the
evidence
on
which
the
government's
conviction
rested
was
attained
as
a
result
of
one
or
more
unlawful
arrests.
secondly,
that
the
detailed
confessions
of
the
two
defendants
were
not
sufficiently
corroborated
by
outside
evidence.
now,
the
first
of
these
points
relates
to
a
course
of
events
that
can
be
very
briefly
summarized
in
this
way.
first,
petitioner
toy
was
arrested,
illegally,
as
the
petitioners
contend
and
at
that
time
made
a
statement
implicating
one
yee,
then
yee
was
arrested
surrendered
a
quantity
of
narcotics
and
made
a
statement
implicating
wong
sun,
then
wong
sun
was
arrested
again
illegally
according
to
the
petitioners.
and
then
subsequently
after
arraignment
both
yee
--
both
he
and
toy
made
the
confession
that
i've
heard
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
wong
sun
is
the
same
as
sea
dog.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right.
that
is
very
similar.
i
may
go
into
this
in
a
more
detail
and
i'll
certainly
cover
that
point.
but
toy
statement
implicating
yee
and
the
narcotics
surrendered
by
yee
and
then
the
admissions
or
the
confessions
of
toy
and
wong
sun
after
arraignment
were
all
admitted
into
evidence
and
in
each
instance
over
the
objections
of
petitioners.
so
petitioner's
first
point
raises
two
questions;
first,
whether
the
arrests
of
petitioners
were
lawful
and
if
not
whether
the
evidence
to
which
petitioners
objected
or
was
the
product
of
that
unlawfulness
so
as
to
render
them
inadmissible.
now,
the
legal
standard
for
a
narcotics
agent
to
arrest
without
warrant
as
established
by
26
u.s.c.
7607
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
person
to
be
arrested
has
committed
or
is
committing
a
narcotics
offense.
this
court
in
the
draper
case
in
358
u.s.
ruled
that
the
reasonable
grounds
of
that
statute
is
the
equivalent
of
the
probable
cause
for
the
fourth
amendment.
this
standard
has
been
articulated
by
the
courts
to
mean
that
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
taken
together
must
be
sufficient
to
warrant
a
reasonable
and
experienced
peace
officer
in
believing
that
an
offense
has
been
or
is
being
committed.
and
that
it
is
in
these
terms
we
submit
that
this
case
must
be
approached.
the
conduct
we're
inquiring
into
is
that
of
federal
law
enforcement
officers
doing
their
conscientious
best
to
control
a
vicious
and
elusive
vice,
a
narcotics
traffic,
and
as
we
consider
the
events
that
took
place
on
the
morning
of
june
4th,
1959,
at
each
stage
of
the
way
we
must
ask
ourselves,
“what
was
it
reasonable
for
this
men
to
do?”
indeed,
i
urged
each
member
of
this
court
to
ask
himself
at
each
stage
what
he
would
have
done,
what
alternatives
he
would
have
seen
as
available
to
him.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
wong
sun
had
been,
yes.
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
that's
right.
that
was
stipulated.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
there
is
none.
no
direct
indication
of
that,
your
honor.
between
5:30
and
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
on
this
particular
morning,
a
federal
narcotics
agent
was
told
by
an
informant
that
he
had
purchased
narcotics
the
previous
day
from
blackie
toy
at
a
laundry
on
leavenworth
street.
now,
this
was
not
an
anonymous
phone
--
phone
call,
it
wasn't
a
whispered
tip
on
a
street
corner.
it
was,
we
submit,
information
with
substantial
indicia
of
reliability.
it
was
given
at
the
narcotics
bureau
office
by
one
hom
way
who
was
then
under
arrest
having
been
found
in
the
possession
of
narcotics.
although
--
though
this
was
the
first
he
had
ever
given
information
on
narcotics
traffic
to
the
agent,
the
agent
had
known
him
for
six
weeks
and
the
agent
testified
a
trial
to
his
belief
that
hom
way
was
reliable.
the
fact
that
hom
way
was
under
arrest
meant
of
course
as
he
no
doubt
knew
that
the
information
would
be
checked
out,
and
he
would
be
confronted
with
any
inconsistency
and
we
submit
that
this
element
provides
a
substantial
element
of
reliability
to
hom
way's
information.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
government
hasn't
taken
a
position
on
that
as
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
because
it
doesn't
feel
it
has
to.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
indicia
that
i'm
now
suggesting,
that
it
might
have
been
that
--
it
might
have
been
reasonable
for
the
agents
to
try
but
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
the
only
thing
we
can
suggest
as
far
as
that
concern
is
that
this
agent
had
been
cautioned,
felt
that
he
didn't
have
enough
to
go
on.
i'll
cover
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
at
this
point
it
was
about
5:30
or
6:00.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
would
guess
it's
probably
around
8:30
or
9:00,
but
i
don't
know
that
for
sure.
now,
i'd
like
to
suggest
one
other
element
that
must
be
taken
into
account
in
assessing
the
reliability
of
hom
way
and
that's
the
fact
that
he
was
actually
found
in
the
possession
of
narcotics.
this
corroborated
a
story
that
he'd
gotten
these
narcotics
from
blackie
toy.
if
an
informant
is
found
and
makes
a
statement
that
he
buys
narcotics
from
someone
and
has
no
narcotics,
of
course
that
is
that
much
more
likely
that
he's
just
doing
this
out
of
spite
or
for
some
other
such
reasons.
now,
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
certainly
not
as
a
matter
of
law,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
we
submit
that
the
agent
who
was
able
to
watch
him,
in
fact
had
been
watching
him
for
six
weeks,
certainly
had
to
take
this
information,
that
it
will
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
assumed
that,
yes
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
the
record
doesn't
show.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
he
still
was
able
to
watch
the
agent
--
watch
the
individual
and
see
what
kind
of
people
he
associated
with,
and
it's
difficult
to
know
or
just
exactly
on
what
the
agent
based
his
feeling
that
the
individual
was
reliable.
these
things
are
highly
intangible.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
wouldn't
say
it
would
establish
his
reliability
or
i'd
say
that
those
were
things
that
the
agent
should
take
into
account
among
all
of
the
circumstances
to
decide
whether
he
should
act
on
this
information.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that
will
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
and
nothing
more
than
what
i've
indicated,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
the
extent
of
it.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
considering
the
ways
in
which
we
think
it
was
corroborated,
yes.
we
think
that
it
might
have
been
probable
cause.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i
--
i
just
referred
to
two
items.
the
fact
--
well,
it's
corroborated
in
his
possession.
he's
saying
that
he
got
the
narcotics
from
a
certain
source.
it
is
tends
to
be
corroborated
by
his
possession
of
narcotics.
and
secondly,
the
fact
that
he's
under
arrest
and
knows
that
that
agent
is
going
to
go
out,
check
up
the
information
and
come
back
and
then
presumably
it
will
go
so
much
the
worst
for
him,
that
hasn't
checked
out.
now,
we
submit
that
this
adds
a
significant
measure
of
reliability.
but
as
i
say,
we're
not
--
it's
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
contend
and
i
prefer
not
to
contend
that
this
did
constitute
--
constitute
a
probable
cause.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
we
can't
eliminate
it.
and
that's
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
your
honor,
our
point
as
i
would
develop
further
is
that
you've
got
to
take
the
sum
of
the
circumstances
and
that
this
information
plus
what
happened
later
gave
the
agent
probable
cause.
you
mustn't
take
each
item
in
isolation.
you
must
take
the
sum
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i
--
i
do
believe
that
the
government
had
probable
cause,
that
the
agent
had
probable
cause
to
force
the
door
of
the
--
toy's
premises.
and
i'll
show
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
will
show
why
that
is
true
and
i'm
simply
saying
that
because
it
is
the
additional
things
that
took
place
later
that
call
for
a
decision
on
the
part
of
the
agent,
that
it
is
really
unnecessary
stop
at
this
point
to
say
was
there
probable
cause.
actually,
the
question
i'd
like
to
ask
at
this
point
your
honor
is
just
what
should
the
agent
have
done
at
that
point,
we
submit
that
whatever
he
did,
he
had
to
do
it
rather
quickly.
i
think
it
was
reasonable
for
agents
engaged
in
trying
to
control
narcotics
traffic
would
fear
that
the
news
of
hom
way's
arrest
might
get
back
to
his
alleged
supplier.
and
that
that
alleged
supplier
might
escape,
might
warn
the
confederates,
might
destroy
or
conceal
narcotics,
which
is
of
course
a
particularly
difficult
problem
when
you're
dealing
with
narcotics
traffic.
now,
should
he
seek
an
arrest
warrant?
apart
from
the
delay
that
would
be
involved,
of
course,
there
would
be
a
delay
involved
considering
that
this
happened
at
6:30
in
the
morning
that
the
information
actually
was
at
5:30
or
6:00
in
the
morning,
perhaps
the
prudent
cautious
agent
would
not
be
fully
satisfied
that
this
was
probable
cause.
looking
at
it
from
the
agent's
point
of
view,
not
from
the
(inaudible)
of
the
courtroom,
but
from
where
he
stood,
perhaps,
he
felt
that
wasn't
quite
enough
to
go
on
and
that
perhaps
he'd
better
he'd
check
the
information
out.
it
was
then
daylight,
only
about
two
hours
before
business
establishments
open
for
the
day,
and
so
it
was
decided
that
the
agents
would
investigate
further
and
they
were
dispatched
to
the
premises.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
your
honor
that
that
would
have
added
a
great
deal
and
considering
the
risk
that
that
delay
would
involve
of
escape
for
a
destruction
of
contraband,
we
submit
that
it
was
certainly,
entirely
reasonable
for
the
agent
to
do
what
he
did
namely
to
undertake
an
investigation
for
the
circumstances.
now,
the
question
has
been
raised
as
to
how
the
information
that
hom
way
gave
to
the
agent
was
sufficient
to
lead
them
to
petitioner
toy's
laundry.
and
the
record
as
mr.
williams
has
indicated,
does
not
clearly
indicate.
i
go
further
that
record,
it
simply
does
not
indicate
the
answer
to
that
question.
and
the
reason
that
the
record
does
not
indicate
is
that
neither
at
trial
nor
even
on
appeal,
did
the
petitioner's
whatever
question
the
sufficiency
of
the
information
to
lead
to
toy.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
record
doesn't
show
that.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
record
does
clearly
show
that
petitioners
only
attack
on
the
information
given
by
hom
way
was
as
to
its
reliability.
and
they
plainly
assumed,
if
you
read
the
record,
you'll
see
that
they
plainly
assumed
that
the
information
was
sufficient
to
lead
the
agents
to
hom
way
--
to
petitioner
toy
rather,
not
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
to
make
an
investigation
at
least,
yes
sir.
directly
in
point
is
the
heitner
case
which
is
cited
at
page
31
of
our
brief.
there,
the
defendants
had
contested
the
existence
of
probable
cause
for
our
--
for
an
arrest.
but
only
on
appeal,
they
first
questioned
whether
the
information
was
actually
in
itself
sufficient
to
lead
the
agents
to
the
officers
to
the
defendants.
the
second
circuit
speaking
through
judge
learned
hand
held
that
if
the
question
had
been
raised
at
trial,
the
government
might
have
been
able
to
prove
that
the
officers
did
have
enough
to
go
on
and
that
it
was
too
late
to
raise
the
issue
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
that's
at
149
f.2d
at
107.
so
here,
if
petitioners
had
raised
any
question
in
this
regard,
the
government
could
have
established.
the
government
could
have
established
that
there
was
a
positive
link
between
the
information
and
petitioner
toy.
but
in
fact
the
question
was
not
raised,
and
we
submit
that
any
deficiency
in
the
record
in
this
regard
must
be
charged
to
the
petitioners
not
to
the
government.
now
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir.
now,
a
group
of
several
agents
went
to
petitioner
toy's
laundry
but
only
one,
a
chinese
agent
went
to
the
door
and
the
other
stayed
as
the
records
indicates
half
a
block
away.
agent
alton
wong
rang
the
door,
rang
the
doorbell
and
then
knocked
and
then
toy
appeared.
now,
apparently,
in
order
to
get
toy
to
come
to
the
door
the
agent
asked
for
his
laundry
and
toy
then
opened
the
door
and
told
him
to
come
back
when
the
laundry
opened
at
eight
o'clock.
now
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
the
count
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
record
i
think
indicates
it's
something
that
isn't
set
forth
in
specific
detail
but
i
think
the
record
fairly
indicates
the
order
that
i've
suggested.
he
said
here's
an
answer
given
by
petitioner
toy,
the
chinese.
and
the
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i'm
sorry,
it's
on
page
38
of
the
record.
the
chinese,
and
there
he
is
referring
to
the
chinese
agent.
“the
chinese
rang
the
bell
and
i
answered
it
and
he
said
he
wanted
his
laundry.
after
i
opened
the
door
and
i
told
him
i
didn't
open
until
8:30.”
perhaps
that's
an
unduly
close
reading
of
the
record
but
we
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
that
is
that,
you
see
this
is
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
this
was
a
--
these
were
glass
--
glass
door,
the
inference
one
might
draw
from
that
is
that
the
agent
rather
saw
petitioner
toy
at
the
back
of
the
business
part
of
the
laundry
which
is
the
front
part
of
the
building.
that
he
--
well,
he
had
a
questioning
look
on
his
face.
he
called,
“i
want
my
laundry”.
and
that
he
--
that
the
petitioner
then
came
to
the
door
and
said
come
back
at
eight
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
oh,
that
might
have
been
what
he
did.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
it
might
have
been
what
he
did?
he
might
have
held
up
any
piece
of
paper
saying
i
want
my
laundry
but
we
don't
know
exactly
what
he
did.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
after
i
opened
the
door
and
i
told
him
i
didn't
opened
until
8:30,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
perhaps
the
--
perhaps
the
inference
could
be
drawn
either
way.
i
don't
--
i
don't
feel
that
it's
particularly
crucial,
your
honor
and
--
and
i
--
it
could
have
been
either
way.
obviously,
as
i
said
perhaps
my
reading
is
an
unduly
close
reading
of
it
and
i
don't
think
it's
material.
now,
counsel
has
referred
to
the
language
problem.
now,
i
must
take
issue
with
his
statement
that
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
record
is
that
the
conversation
took
place
in
english.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggests
that,
and
as
you
know,
both
participants
in
the
conversation
were
themselves
chinese.
furthermore,
apart
from
that
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
would
guess
that
chinese
agents
in
san
francisco
do,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
would
guess
that
from
general
experience.
i
--
i'm
not
testifying
but
i
would
guess
that,
yes.
but
furthermore,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
this
point
need
be
or
should
be
allowed
to
become
crucial
at
any
stage.
but
again
to
clear
up
the
record,
the
record
makes
it
quite
clear
that
petitioner
toy
did
speak
quite
adequate
english.
and
the
interpreter
was
there
not
for
toy
but
for
wong
sun.
the
record
on
page
16
is
where
the
explanation
of
why
the
interpreter
is
there
appears
and
there's
just
no
question
considering
the
record
taken
as
a
whole
that
toy
speaks
good
english.
in
fact,
he
testified
in
english
as
the
record
on
page
39
clearly
indicates.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
record
indicates
and
it's
again
not
completely
clear
that
at
that
--
and
right
at
that
point
that
i
just
cited
at
39,
that
he
would
discuss
the
questions
with
the
interpreter
and
then
answer.
that's
--
that's
what
the
record
appears
to
indicate
but
he
did
answer
in
english.
now,
at
the
point
to
which
i
have
read
--
the
point
i
have
reached
namely
that
petitioner
toy
said
“come
back
when
the
laundry
opens
at
eight”,
the
agent
showed
his
badge
and
said
that
he
was
a
federal
narcotics
agent.
at
that
point,
toy
slammed
the
door
and
ran
to
the
rear
of
the
laundry
an
exodus,
which
as
i've
indicated,
was
in
full
view
of
the
agent
because
the
door
of
the
laundry
was
made
of
glass,
he
could
see
what
was
happening.
now,
toy
never
offered,
nor
does
the
record
suggest
at
any
point
at
any
reason
for
this
hasty
departure.
there
are
no
hints
in
the
record
that
it
was
out
of
fear
of
anything
except
perhaps
of
the
discovery
of
his
illicit
activities.but
whatever
the
real
reason
for
the
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
i
wouldn't
contend
that
at
all,
your
honor.
i'm
just
saying
that
under
these
circumstances,
i
think
we
must
ask
what
it
was
reasonable
for
this
agent
to
do.
and
i
ask
was
it
unreasonable
for
him
to
conclude
that
toy's
flight
reflected
a
consciousness
of
guilt
and
a
purpose
to
escape
or
to
destroy
narcotics.
and
again
i
ask
each
member
of
this
court
to
consider
what
a
conscientious
law
enforcement
officer
having
substantial
although
perhaps
not
conclusive
information
that
a
suspect
was
dealing
in
narcotics
should
do
when
that
suspect
upon
learning
of
the
officer's
identity
suddenly
takes
flight,
should
he'd
gone
off
and
obtain
an
arrest
for
a
search
warrant?
surely,
the
risk
of
the
suspect
of
escaping
and
notifying
confederates,
destroying
narcotics
was
too
great
for
that.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
absolutely,
your
honor.
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no.
the
probable
cause
that
must
occur
to
the
--
must
appear
i
should
say
to
the
commissioner
is
certainly
the
same
probable
cause
that
must
appear
to
the
agent.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right.
it's
the
same
thing.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
and
--
i
would
certainly
say
that
as
i
meant
to
say
if
i
didn't
say
that
the
situation
would
really
be
the
same
no
matter
what
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
but
your
honor
i
would
--
i
would
certainly
agree
with
you
that
that
--
where
circumstances
permit
that
is
certainly
the
desirable
way
to
proceed.
but
the
law
clearly
recognizes
the
possible
existence
of
exigent
circumstances,
and
of
course,
here,
we
are
attempting
to
show
exigent
circumstances
that
reasonably
indicated
to
the
agent
that
following
the
normal
and
desirable
course
would
jeopardize
the
success
of
this
particular
investigation.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
certainly
not,
your
honor.
and
i
not
meant
to
suggest
and
i
certainly
do
not
suggest
that
the
comfort
of
the
commissioner
should
figure
importantly
in
the
agent
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
route
him
out
of
bed.
the
question
is
the
amount
of
time
that
that
would
entail
plus
of
course
the
questions
and
i've
suggested
as
to
whether
the
agent
felt
that
he
at
that
time
had
probable
cause.
now,
many
federal
and
state
decisions
substantiate
the
judgment
that
the
agent
adopted
holding
that
reasonably
founded
suspicions
plus
the
element
of
flight
constitute
probable
cause
for
an
arrest.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
31
and
32
a
number
of
those
cases.
as
an
example,
i
might
again
refer
to
the
heitner
case
which
i
have
already
cited
and
that
is
cited
at
page
31
of
our
brief.
there,
the
record
indicated
only
that
the
officers
had
been
instructed
by
their
superiors
to
watch
a
particular
building
that
was
suspected
of
containing
an
illegal
steel.
two
people
who
had
come
out
of
the
building
appeared
to
recognize
the
officers
as
officers
and
they
took
flight.
judge
hand
held
that
the
information
plus
the
flight
suffice
to
make
out
a
--
make
out
probable
cause
for
an
arrest.
and
we
submit,
that
in
this
case,
the
combination
of
the
information
the
agent
had
plus
the
element
of
flight
clearly
constituted
probable
cause
and
that
the
agent
therefore
justified
in
forcing
toy's
door
and
pursuing
him
and
arresting
him.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
by
and
large,
your
honor,
these
cases
do
involved
instances
in
which
the
person
is
perhaps
in
an
automobile.
none
of
them
immediately
comes
to
mind
where
a
person
was
brought
from
his
bed.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
your
honor
under
the
circumstances
it
seems
to
me
this
is
flight.
there's
no
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
there's
no
suggestion
that
he
never
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i'm
sorry?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
not
direct
authority
for
that
particular
proposition,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
these
--
the
cases
naturally
involved
such
a
wide
variety
of
individual
circumstances.
it
is
difficult
to
draw
absolute
ironclad
principles
and
we're
simply
saying
that
that
this
element
combined
with
the
other
element
of
information
has
very
often
been
have
held
to
justify
that
one
can
do
very
little
more
than
--
and
examine
the
cases
and
see
where
that
balance
brings
in.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
am
aware
of
none.
i
would
suppose
that
there
would
be
some
but
i'm
unaware.
the
court
below,
as
the
counsel
has
pointed
out
disagree,
the
court
below
held
that
the
--
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
toy's
arrest,
but
we
believe
that
its
basis
for
so
ruling
is
erroneous
on
its
face.
as
the
opinion
discloses
at
page
139
and
40
of
the
record,
the
court
considered
these
two
elements
of
probable
cause
information
and
flight
separately,
finding
either
one
alone
sufficient
to
constitute
probable
cause.
it
included
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
but
as
the
cases
make
it
clear
we
have
cited
the
cases
for
this
proposition
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
probable
cause
is
to
be
determined
by
the
combination
of
relevant
circumstances
and
we
submit
that
the
sum
of
the
facts
on
which
the
agent
here
acted
was
plainly
sufficient.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
no.
not
--
he
merely
admitted
the
evidence
and
counsel
certainly
entitled
to
argue
that
he
could
have
done
so
because
he
--
he
adopted
our
second
argument.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
that's
right.
the
agents'
failure
to
announce
his
purpose
we
submit
did
not
affect
the
validity
of
the
arrest.
there's
well
recognized
exception
to
the
rule
requiring
the
announcement
of
purpose
which
exists
where
an
officer
has
reason
to
believe
that
an
announcement
is
useless
or
that
it
will
facilitate
escape
for
the
destruction
of
contraband.
this
exception
was
acknowledged,
if
not
adopted,
by
the
miller
case.
and
we
submit
that
the
exception
is
clearly
applicable
here.
as
to
the
uselessness,
we
submit,
that
when
somebody
flees
because
he
has
seen
your
badge
he
knows
why
you're
there.
and
secondly,
we
do
contend
that
the
--
any
delay
at
all
might
reasonably
have
been
viewed
by
the
agent
as
risking
the
possibility
that
the
contraband
would
be
destroyed
as
you
know,
narcotics
can
be
destroyed
very
quickly
by
simply
running
them
down
the
sink
or
down
the
drain.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir,
basically.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
i
mean
at
this
point
because
of
the
character
of
narcotics.
and
obviously,
the
agent
had
foremost
in
his
mind,
the
information
that
he
had
no
doubt
narcotics
agents
are
very
much
--
very
acutely
aware
of
the
ease
of
destruction
of
narcotics
and
that
certainly
figures
into
their
thinking,
no
doubt.
now,
we
submit
that
there
can
be
no
serious
question
as
to
the
legality
of
petitioner
wong
sun's
arrest.
we
believe
that
the
agents
had
more
than
ample
cause
to
arrest
him.
after
johnny
yee
had
surrendered
the
narcotics,
he
said
that
he
had
received
them
from
toy
and
from
one
sea
dog.
now,
this
statement
was
hardly
corroborated
again
by
the
fact
that
he
had
narcotics.
this
wasn't
a
statement
that
he
was
just
making
for
the
fun
of
it
or
spite.
there
was
some
corroboration
from
the
fact
that
he
actually
had
narcotics
himself.
it
was
further
corroborated
by
the
fact
that
toy
had
already
disclosed
his
familiarity
with
yee
by
the
fact
that
toy
had
correctly
specified
the
amount
of
narcotics
that
the
agents
could
expect
to
find
at
yee's
place.
and
toy
thereupon
identified
wong
sun
as
sea
dog.
now,
this
fact
is
an
important
fact
because
it
also
corroborates
yee's
statement
because
it
indicates
that
toy
and
wong
sun
were
familiar
with
one
another.
and
of
course
this
was
further
corroborated
and
an
additional
bit
of
information
which
developed
when
toy
actually
went
along
with
the
agents
and
showed
them
where
wong
sun
lived.
we
believe
that
it's
really
difficult
to
imagine
what
more
could
be
asked
for
in
the
way
of
probable
cause
for
an
arrest.
moreover,
substantially
the
same
factors
that
require
the
agents
to
move
quickly
with
respect
to
toy
obtained,
we
submit,
with
respect
to
wong
sun.
two
of
the
persons
with
whom
he
was
dealing
in
narcotics
had
now
been
arrested,
toy
and
yee.
and
since
yee
had
identified
him
as
a
supplier,
the
agents
could
reasonably
suppose
that
he
had
narcotics,
and
upon
learning
of
these
arrests
that
he
might
well
destroy
them
nor
we
submit
as
the
record
disclosed
anything
improper
about
the
manner
in
which
the
arrest
took
place.
now,
of
course,
if
as
we
contend
that
the
petitioner's
arrest
were
lawful,
the
petitioner's
challenges
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
fall
at
the
outset.
we
believe,
however,
that
even
if
the
arrests
were
unlawful,
the
challenged
evidence
was
admissible.
now,
of
course,
the
silverthorne,
in
nardone
cases
have
established
beyond
any
questions
drawn.
the
evidence
which
is
the
product
of
an
illegal
governmental
action
is
not
admissible
in
a
federal
prosecution.
however,
both
of
those
decisions
recognized
that
there
are
reasonable
limits
to
the
reach
of
this
doctrine.
nardone,
the
court
said
that
the
connection
between
the
governmental
action
and
the
evidence
that
i
quote
“may
have
become
so
attenuated
as
to
dissipate
the
taint.”
perhaps
the
most
notable
class
of
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
found
the
connection
to
attenuate
it
for
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
are
those
involving
a
voluntary
statement
made
shortly
after
an
illegal
arrest
with
surprising
consistency,
both
state
and
federal
courts
generally
held
that
genuinely
voluntary
statements
made
in
the
course
of
an
unlawful
arrest
cannot
be
regarded
as
the
product
of
that
arrest.
we've
set
forth
some
of
those
cases
on
pages
42
and
43
of
our
brief
and
a
complete
list
is
to
be
found
in
the
article
by
professor
kamisar
which
we
have
cited
and
that's
at
page
81
of
his
article.
this
court
has
never
ruled
directly
on
the
point
although
such
cases
as
the
bayer
case
in
331
u.s.
seemed
to
us
to
proceed
on
the
same
essential
assumptions
as
these
lower
court
cases.
there,
the
defendant
had
made
a
confession
that
was
unlawful
under
the
mcnabb
rule,
and
thereafter
he
made
a
second
one
based
on
the
first.
the
court
although
recognizing
and
i
quote,
“a
later
confession
always
maybe
looked
upon
as
fruit
of
the
first”
still
held
the
exclusionary
rule
to
be
inapplicable.
we
believe
that
the
rationale
of
these
cases
particularly
as
i
say,
the
state
and
federal
lower
court
cases
that
have
developed
the
position
i've
suggested,
is
that
a
genuinely
voluntary
statement
constitutes
an
intervening
independent
act
of
a
freewill
that
breaks
the
chain
of
causation
between
the
arrest
and
the
evidence.
that
these
cases
recognized
that
when
the
police
acquired
voluntary
statements
such
as
that
involved
in
this
case,
it's
purely
fortuitous.
and
therefore,
it's
relatively
unlikely
that
the
police
are
going
to
make
an
unlawful
arrest
in
order
to
obtain
voluntary
statements.
thus,
the
minimal
deterrent
effect
of
excluding
such
statement
is
outweighed
by
the
public
interest
in
convicting
the
guilty.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
don't
believe
there
was,
your
honor.
i'll
develop
that
in
a
little
more
detail.
but
that's
right,
we
don't
believe
that
there
was
any
measurable
element
of
coercion
present.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i'll
--
again,
in
developing
that
point
a
little
more
detail
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
suggest
--
i
believe
that
in
this
case
very
clearly
so
considering
the
character
of
the
statement,
very
clearly,
so
of
course
anybody
who
is
--
is
brought
in
conflict
with
law
enforcement
officials
is
obviously
less
at
ease
than
he
might
otherwise
be.
but
remember
we're
talking
about
voluntary
statements
and
i
certainly
agree
with
your
honor
in
a
suggestion
that
we
must
certainly
be
certain
of
the
voluntariness
of
any
such
statement.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor,
considering
the
circumstances
as
i'll
spell
them
out
in
a
little
more
detail.
now,
i
believe
that
these
cases
that
i've
been
discussing
recognized
too
that
if
an
intervening
act
of
free
will
does
not
bring
about
the
attenuation
referred
to
in
nardone,
then
it's
difficult
to
imagine
what
will.
in
short
if
there
are
limits
to
the
doctrine
and
surely
we
feel
this
must
be
it.
now,
of
course
in
enforcing
this
rule
the
courts
have
been
careful
to
insist
that
the
voluntary
statements
be
voluntary
in
fact,
thus
in
a
nueslein
and
the
(inaudible)
cases
which
petitioners
cite,
the
defendant's
appeared
to
be
intoxicated
when
they
gave
the
evidence
in
question.
such
acts
could
of
course,
scarcely
be
held
to
be
voluntary.
also,
when
an
illegally
arrested
defendant
is
confronted
with
illegally
obtained
evidence,
the
courts
have
often
held
that
that
does
not
present
a
sufficient
level
of
voluntariness
as
to
allow
the
admission
of
the
evidence.
now,
in
this
background
let
--
let
us
turn
to
the
challenged
evidence
in
this
case.
the
first
item
is
of
course
the
first
--
the
toy's
implication
of
johnny
yee
made
at
the
scene
of
arrest
and
of
course
from
that
stem
petitioner's
various
other
contentions.
now,
we
submit
that
a
reading
of
the
record
clearly
discloses
that
this
statement
was
completely
unsolicited.
and
that
we
submit
is
an
important
element
to
take
into
account
in
determining
just
how
voluntary
it
was.
it
was
not
an
answer
to
a
question.
toy
was
informed
by
the
agents
as
the
record
shows
on
page
63.
he
was
informed
by
the
agents
that
he
had
been
named
by
hom
way
as
possessing
narcotics.
petitioner
said,
“no,
i
haven't
been
selling
narcotics
at
all.”
then
he
said,
“however,
i
do
know
somebody
who
has”
and
we
submit
that
there
was
nothing
about
his
arrest
that
caused
--
that
made
the
petitioner
accuse
yee.
no
evidence
was
found
at
his
place
and
no
doubt
he
knew
no
evidence
was
going
to
be
found
in
his
place.
so
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
explain
a
way.
as
the
court
below
found
nothing
in
the
record
so
much
as
hints
at
coercion
or
involuntariness
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
neither
a
trial
nor
an
appeal
that
the
petitioner
ever
so
contend,
the
contention
was
simply
that
as
a
matter
of
law
if
there
is
an
unlawful
arrest
that
the
statement
would
fall.
indeed,
we
suggest,
that
it
is
an
even
more
clearly
admissible
than
the
ordinary
voluntary
statement
because
here
toy
deliberately
sought
to
divert
suspicion
from
himself
by
sidetracking
the
agents
in
the
direction
of
yee.
no
doubt
he
was
quite
hopeful
that
yee
would
have
by
then
destroyed
the
evidence
or
that
he
may
have
used
it
up
by
then
in
any
event
it
seems
quite
clear
and
i
think
counsel
recognized
this
that
toy
certainly
was
not
intending
to
implicate
himself.
and
we
suggest
this
case
as
quite
analogous
to
cases
in
which
offers
of
bribes
to
officers
had
been
held
to
be
--
had
been
held
to
be
admissible
even
though
made
in
the
course
of
an
unlawful
arrest.
we've
cited
a
couple
of
those
cases
on
page
48
of
our
brief.
now,
the
second
challenged
item
of
evidence
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
he
said
he
saw
it
last
night.
he
--
when
he
was
asked
how
much
was
there,
he
said
there's
been
about
a
piece.
i
supposed
you
could
argue,
your
honor
that
--
because
he
withheld
this
argue
--
this
information
very
much
longer.
he
might
be
thought
to
be
improperly
withholding
evidence.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
your
honor
that's
--
that's
a
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
49,
it's
a
summary
by
the
--
by
counsel.
the
testimony
--
the
only
place
for
the
conversation
actually
appears
at
page
63.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
i
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i
hope
he
wasn't
purporting
to
testify
though.
now,
the
second
challenged
item
of
evidence
is
the
narcotics
itself
that
yee
voluntarily
delivered
to
the
agents.
this
is
basically
a
derivative
challenge
based
on
the
alleged
inadmissibility
of
this
tip
on
the
part
of
toy
that
i've
referred
to.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
this
had
--
this
is
where
the
conversation
is
set
forth
in
detail
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
in
the
same
way.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
that
comes
quite
a
bit
after
he
had
actually
made
the
statement,
volunteered
the
statement
that
he
knew
where
there
was
some.
but
you're
quite
right
in
suggesting
that
there
are
certainly
is
--
that
there
certainly
are
the
elements
of
a
violation
of
the
act
in
that
statement.
now,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever
for
a
challenge
to
the
admissibility
of
the
narcotics
themselves
here
to
taint
any
unlawful
arrest
was
attenuated
by
not
one
but
two
voluntary
independent
acts.
toy's
implication
of
yee
and
then
yee's
voluntary
surrender
of
the
narcotics,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
nothing
at
all
to
suggest
that
the
surrender
of
the
narcotics
by
yee
was
anything
but
completely
voluntary.
we
submit
that
there's
no
basis
in
law
or
indeed
in
common
sense
for
stretching
the
exclusionary
rules
so
far
as
to
cover
the
narcotics
surrendered
by
yee.
finally,
the
petitioners
of
course
challenged
the
admissibility
of
the
confessions
that
they
made.
each
of
these
statement
--
statements
was
made
after
petitioners'
had
been
arraigned
and
freed
on
their
own
recognizance
--
recognizance
and
each
of
the
petitioners
was
fully
advised
at
the
time
he
made
the
statement
of
his
rights
--
his
right
to
counsel
and
his
right
not
to
make
any
statement,
in
fact
that
any
statement
might
be
held
against
him.
now,
the
challenge
to
toy's
confession
would
seem,
we
think,
to
fall
by
virtue
of
the
bayer
case
where
at
the
very
worst,
it
was
only
a
second
confession
made
after
an
unlawfully
obtained
statement.
and
as
to
petitioner
wong
sun's
confession
and
indeed
as
to
all
of
the
evidence
that
corroborated
it,
we
are
unable
to
proceed
any
basis
for
the
exclusion
of
that
evidence.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
forms
even
the
most
tenuous
link
between
wong
sun's
arrest
and
any
of
the
evidence
that
was
used
against
him.
his
confession
was
made
four
days
after
he'd
been
arraigned
and
freed
on
his
own
recognizance
and
the
narcotics,
which
constitute
the
principal
corroboration
were
of
course
surrendered
before
he
was
even
arrested.
and
as
to
the
possibility
that
wong
sun's
confess
--
confession
was
the
product
of
toy's
unlawful
arrest.
no
court
has
ever
suggested.
indeed,
i
wonder
if
any
court
has
even
been
asked
to
rule
that
the
silverthorne
and
nardone
doctrine
could
be
stretched
so
far.
between
toy's
arrest
and
wong
sun's
arrest
were
at
least
five
intervening
acts,
voluntary
acts,
toy's
implication
of
yee,
yee
surrender
of
the
narcotics,
yee's
later
implication
of
wong
sun,
toy's
identification
of
wong
sun
and
then
toy's
later
guiding
the
agents
to
wong
sun's
house.
as
i
said,
there's
no
basis
for
any
link
between
that
arrest
and
the
confession
four
days
later.
we
believe
it
would
make
a
mockery
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
say
that
the
evidence
of
wong
sun's
guilt
was
in
any
legally
relevant
sense,
a
product
of
toy's
arrest.
now,
we
submit
that
only
the
detailed
confessions
of
the
petitioners
voluntarily
made
and
fully
admissible,
but
today
were
sufficiently
corroborated
by
outside
evidence.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
evidence
corroborating
the
various
elements
of
the
offense.
that's
at
pages
54
and
63.
but
i
do
wish
to
deal
briefly
with
the
point
that
counsel
has
raised
here.
petitioners
contend
that
there
was
no
corroboration
for
their
knowledge
that
the
heroin
had
been
unlawfully
imported.
now,
of
course
this
element
of
the
offense
is
applied
by
the
statutory
presumption
arising
out
of
unexplained
possession
of
the
narcotics.
that's
in
21
u.s.c.
174,
plainly,
the
presumption
which
itself
arises
outside
of
the
confession
does
not
need
corroboration.
it
had
to
be
corroborated.
we
question
what
would
be
the
point
of
having
the
presumption
in
the
first
place,
it
assumes
that
evidence
of
that
character
is
virtually
impossible
to
develop.
and
we
submit
the
element
of
possession
itself
was
adequate
--
adequately
corroborated.
the
corroboration,
and
of
course
the
corroboration,
as
the
smith
case
pointed
out,
does
not
have
to
be
in
itself
a
complete
statement
of
the
particular
element
of
the
offense.
it
must
merely
support
the
believability
of
the
element
in
the
confession.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
there's
--
you
were
certainly
right
in
your
suggestion
to
counsel
that
it
is
the
possession
of
that
narcotic
that
that
is
in
question
here.
now,
of
course,
those
narcotics
were
surrendered
and
they
were
introduced
in
evidence.
and
we
submit
that
those
narcotics
when
taken,
in
connection
when
the
--
the
element
of
possession
is
proved
through
the
confessions
of
these
two
defendants
provides
adequate
corroboration,
they
had
both
confessed
to
having
participated
in
the
bringing
of
narcotics
to
yee.
they
both
indicated
their
knowledge
of
the
precise
amount
that
he
had.
counsel
has
suggested
that
petitioner
toy
didn't
confess
to
any
possession,
but
he
did
confess
to
possession
of
enough
to
have
a
smoke
and
we
submit
that
the
statute
doesn't
say
it
has
to
be
possession
of
substantial
amount
that
that
possession
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
there
was
sufficient.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
my
point
--
my
point,
your
honor
is
that
the
narcotics
themselves
when
proved
through
the
various
statements
not
only
the
statements
of
possession
but
the
various
statements
made
by
the
petitioners
in
their
detailed
confessions
do
adequately
corroborated.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
alright,
toy
confessed
that
on
a
number
of
occasions
he
had
driven
wong
sun
to
yee's
house.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
for
$10
or
$15
as
he
said,
and
that
on
at
least
one
occasion
and
the
inference
clearly
is
on
each
occasion
wong
sun
delivered
heroin
to
yee
and
he
gave
toy
some
of
it
to
smoke.
he
also
testified
that
on
last
tuesday,
may
26th
in
his
language
they
made
such
a
trip
and
that
on
june
3rd,
he
had
smoked
some
heroin
at
yee's.
now,
we
believe
that
the
primary
corroborations
of
the
fact
--
oh,
i
might,
i
might
add
one
additional
point
and
that
is
of
course
that,
as
you
pointed
out
mr.
justice
brennan,
at
the
time
he
actually
turned
over
the
narcotics
to
--
at
the
time
he
implicated
yee,
he
made
an
additional
statement
indicating
his
knowledge
of
what
yee
had
and
so
on.
the
surrender
of
the
narcotics
by
yee
is,
we
believe,
is
the
most
persuasive
element
of
this.
at
his
own
establishment,
he
had
indicated
his
knowledge
of
the
quantity
that
yee
had.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i'm
endeavoring
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir.
the
amount
seized
was
of
course
a
little
shorter
of
an
ounce.
and
this
was
--
the
absence
of
an
ounce
was
in
fact
an
element
corroborating
this
because
toy
in
his
confession
stated
that
on
the
occasions
of
these
deliveries,
“we've
been
smoking
a
little
bit
ourselves.”
and
then
of
course
he
also
said
that
on
the
third
of
june
which
was
the
night
before
he
was
arrested,
he
had
gone
again
and
smoke
some,
so
that
would
account
for
the
missing
gram
of
narcotics.
now,
his
familiarity
with
yee's
house,
we
submit,
was
an
important
element
of
corroboration.
he
very
carefully
described
just
where
the
house
was.
the
agents
went
there
unerringly.
and
yee's
testimony
that
yee
and
toy
had
known
one
another,
this
is
testimony
at
trial,
that
yee
and
toy
had
known
one
another
for
seven
or
eight
years,
corroborated
the
whole
course
of
confession
that
he
had
made
these
many
visits
to
yee's
house
in
which
they
brought
narcotics
on
each
occasion.
the
fact
that
he
knew
as
i
say
how
much
was
there,
it
was
an
important
corroboration
and
the
fact
that
he
had
been
there
the
night
before.
we
submit
that
this
spelled
out
in,
perhaps
more
articulate
more
complete
detail
in
our
brief.
we
believe
that
all
of
that
quite
adequately
corroborated
the
confession
of
toy.
we
do
emphasize
toy
attempted
to
be
fairly
clever
in
his
confession.
he
didn't
actually
come
out
and
state,
i
did
it.
he
didn't
come
out
and
really
admit
every
--
every
element
except
the
one
provided
by
the
statutory
presumption
as
wong
sun
did.
but
we
believe
that
without
any
question,
the
various
elements
of
corroboration
notably
the
actual
surrender
of
narcotics
by
yee,
provided
complete
corroboration
to
cover
every
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i've
indicated
--
we
feel
very
strongly
that
--
that
the
narcotics
themselves
did
not
--
could
not
in
any
reasonable
way
be
said
to
flow
from
the
arrest.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
if
we
think
in
terms
of
but-for
causation
that
--
that
they
would
never
have
gotten
to
yee's
house,
but
for
their
engaging
in
the
original
arrest.
perhaps
that
it's
true.
but
if
we
adopt
that
sort
of
causation,
then
the
very
rule
that
counsel
has
disclaimed
namely
that
once
you
have
an
unlawful
arrest
that's
the
end
of
it.
you
might
as
well
dismiss
the
defendant
because
you're
never
going
to
be
able
to
do
anything
against
him.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i'm
just
saying,
i'm
just
saying
--
he
wouldn't
even
go
that
far.
he
recognized
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
that
there
are
reasonable
limits
and
we
urged
as
i
argued
that
the
narcotics
were
surrendered
again
voluntarily
by
yee,
a
third
person,
that
there
had
been
--
that
there
--
it
was
that
independent
voluntary
act
coupled
with
yee
--
with
toy's
own
independent
completely
unnecessary
implication
of
yee.
we
do
believe
that
that
corroboratory
evidence
was
completely
divorced
from
the
arrest.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
our
contention
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no.
we
believe
not,
your
honor.
because
we
believe
that
even
the
very
statement
that
he
made
in
the
course
of
the
arrest,
very
shortly
after
the
arrest,
the
voluntary
statements
saying
i
know
somebody
who
has
narcotics.
we
believe
that
that
was
not
the
product
of
the
arrest.
we
believe
that
was
not
the
fruit
of
the
poison
tree.
if
the
--
even
if
the
arrest
be
invalid
which
we
don't
believe
it
is.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
