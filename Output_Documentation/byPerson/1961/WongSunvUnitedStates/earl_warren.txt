mr.

you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
we
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
this
the
arrest
that
came
at
6:30
in
the
morning?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
--
when
the
man
closed
the
door
and
then
went
back
to
the
room
where
his
wife
and
baby
were
in
--
in
bed
and
where
the
police
came
in
and
drew
a
revolver
on
him
and
put
him
under
arrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
might
be
an
element
of
coercion
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
very
little
but
i'll
--
i'll
give
you
five
minutes
more
to,
if
--
if
you
desire.
mr

chief

--
whatever.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
have
the
next
five
minutes
if
you
desire.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
court
below
found
that
it
was
illegal,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
of
appeals
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
found
that
it
was
illegal,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
appoint
an
interpreter
for
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
officer
told
two
different
stories
to
--
to
wah
toy,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
came
he
--
would
he
came,
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
lied
to
him
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
he
lied
to
him
and
said
he
was
there
for
the
laundry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
did
they
--
did
they
have
the
right
to
arrest
him
at
the
time
they
went
to
the
door?
chief
justice

we'll
recess

mr.
williams.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
in
--
what
was
in
the
drawer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
what
was
done
with
toy
in
the
meantime
after
the
search
of
his
place
and
others
who
were
searched?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
happened
to
yee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
place
in
the
government's
brief
where
they
do
specifically
claim
that
the
information
given
by
hom
way
was
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
the
only
thing
they
have
to
say
about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doolittle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
consider
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
fact
that
police
found
this
man
to
be
a
narcotic
violator
and
in
possession
of
narcotics
makes
him
a
reliable
informer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
was
it
besides
that
fact
that
that
would
make
him
a
reliable
informer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
count?
watching
him
if
he
was
a
narcotics
violator?
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
that
tend
to
increase
his
reliability?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
just
take
the
record
which
we're
dealing
with
here
with
the
fact
that
this
man
had
been
suspected
of
being
a
narcotic
violator
for
six
weeks
by
this
officer
and
then
he
was
arrested
and
found
to
be
a
narcotic
violator
with
narcotics
in
his
possession,
would
all
of
that
established
his
reliability
as
an
informer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
tell
us
if
you
please
--
tell
us
if
you
please
what
else
there
is
in
the
record
to
establish
the
reliability
of
this
hom
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then,
if
that
is
all
there
is
in
the
record,
you
would
not
say
that
that
constituted
a
probable
cause,
would
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
telling
us
in
what
ways
it
was
corroborated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we
can
eliminate
that
part
from
the
case
then,
can't
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why?
why
can't
we,
if
you
refuse
to
take
the
position
that
it
is
sufficient.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
although
the
government
is
unwilling
to
take
the
position
that
they
have
probable
cause
to
break
into
this
man's
place
based
upon
this
information
from
hom
way
that
we
ought
--
we
ought
to
assume
that
it
was
a
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
wasn't
because
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
didn't
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
the
answer
that
he
gave
say,
“after
i
opened
the
door
and
i
told
him,”
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
read
it
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
is
there
in
that
to
indicate
that
he
told
him
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
told
him
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
usually
--
do
narcotic
agents
usually
talk
in
chinese?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
guess
that
from
the
records?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
interpretation
either
to
or
from
him
in
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
it
be
the
same
--
doesn't
the
law
contemplate
that
before
a
search
or
seizure
is
made
that
under
all
normal
circumstances
that
it's
a
judicial
act
to
determine
the
credibility
of
the
witness
on
the
issue
of
the
search
warrant
and
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
the
man
--
if
the
man
was
brought
before
the
commissioner
and
made
his
affidavit
and
the
commissioner
had
a
right
to
observe
him
and
cross-question
him
and
do
the
other
things
that'
quite
been
necessary
to
establish
credibility.
and
he
then
swore
to
it
when
the
commissioner
issued
a
warrant,
wouldn't
that
be
essentially
different
from
--
from
accumulating
these
little
things
that
you've
been
talking
about
then,
and
the
officer
making
up
his
mind
and
breaking
down
a
door
and
chasing
a
man
into
his
bedroom.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
--
is
there
--
in
any
of
those
cases,
is
there
anything
comparable
to
this
case
where
a
man
is
feasibly
at
home
and
he
is
accustomed
in
the
way
he
was
and
fled
as
you
choose
to
call
it
from
his
front
door
to
his
bedroom
considered
flight
in
a
legal
sense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
normally,
you'd
hardly
consider
flight
as
a
man
running
from
his
front
door
to
his
bedroom
where
his
wife
and
baby
are,
would
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
authority
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
authority
for
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
asked
if
any
of
these
cases
were
authority
for
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
arrive
at
that
conclusion,
mr.
doolittle,
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
narcotics?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
question
or
because
of
the
reliability
of
the
information
that
they
had?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
there
is
no
coercion
involved
where
a
man
during
the
time
he
normally
sleeps
is
aroused
out
of
bed
and
is
arrested
in
his
own
bedroom
in
front
of
his
wife
and
baby
and
he's
handcuffed
and
then
he's
talked
to.
do
you
maintain
there's
no
coercion
involved
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
a
man
is
in
the
state
--
same
state
of
mind
as
any
free
person
would
be
in
making
a
statement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
believe
this
--
this
case
brings
certainty
to
the
mind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
detailing
just
what
corroboration
there
is
of
toy's
guilt
--
or
his
confession
rather.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
are
you
--
you're
detailing
the
--
the
corroborated
reference
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
against
toy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
against
toy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
--
any
of
that
corroborated
evidence
against
toy
that
did
not
flow
from
his
statement
made
at
the
time
of
this
arrest.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
a
--
it's
the
fruit
of
the
investigation.
i
mean
fruit
of
the
statement
that
toy
made
to
you,
was
it
not,
that
they
would
find
this
at
yee's
house?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
think
he
went
that
far,
did
he?i
thought
you
specifically
said,
“i
just
saw
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
goes
back
--
all
goes
back
to
the
validity
of
the
arrest,
does
it
not?
if
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
the
arrest
was
--
if
the
arrest
was
illegal
and
he
made
this
statement
as
a
consequence
of
that
arrest,
then
that
would
be
fruit
of
poison
tree,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
williams.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
--
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
williams
before
you
sit
down
i
want
to
express
appreciation
of
the
court
to
you
for
having
accepted
this
assignment
and
particularly
for
the
double
duty
he
had
been
compelled
to
make.
the
court
is
always
appreciative
of
the
efforts
of
counsel
that
gives
us
great
confidence
and
all
of
the
members
of
the
bar
who
are
willing
to
take
these
assignments
without
compensation
to
themselves
and
with
great
effort
on
their
part.
mr.
doolittle
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
want
to
thank
you
also
for
the
fair
way
that
you
presented
the
case
of
the
government.
it's
always
covering
to
see
counsel
act
as
you
two
have
in
this
case.
