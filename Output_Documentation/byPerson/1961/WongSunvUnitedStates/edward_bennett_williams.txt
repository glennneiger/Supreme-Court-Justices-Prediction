mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
i
think
that
i
can
best
be
helpful
to
the
court
at
the
outset
by
reviewing
in
a
cursory
way
the
factual
background
against
which
the
legal
issues
holds
here
are
raised.
the
place
in
which
the
events
germane
here
occurred
was
san
francisco.
the
time
was
june
4,
1959
and
the
hour
was
2
a.m.
at
that
time,
a
chinese
named
hom
way
was
arrested
by
federal
narcotics
officers
and
in
his
possession
was
found
an
ounce
of
heroin.
he
was
taken
to
federal
narcotics
headquarters
in
san
francisco
and
there
began
a
systematic
interrogation
of
hom
way.
at
5:30
in
the
morning
of
the
same
day
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
at
2
a.m.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
--
at
--
he
was
taken
forthwith
to
headquarters.
his
arrest
was
made
at
2
a.m.
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
he
was
then
interrogated.
and
at
5:30
a.m.,
he
identified
the
source
of
his
heroin
as
being
one
“blackie
toy”
who
operated
a
laundry
on
leavenworth
street
in
the
heart
of
chinatown
in
san
francisco.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that
is
never
cleared
off
by
the
record,
mr.
justice
harlan.
he
was
identified
by
hom
way
as
the
source
of
his
heroin.
the
name
given
was
“blackie
toy”
and
it
was
stated
by
hom
way
that
he
operated
a
laundry
on
leavenworth
street
and
forthwith
a
posse
was
formed,
a
posse
of
seven
agents
from
the
federal
narcotics
bureau
who
immediately
went
to
leavenworth
street
in
san
francisco.
and
they
stopped
at
a
laundry
known
as
“oye's
laundry”,
o-y-e-s
laundry.
now,
hom
way,
if
the
court
please,
had
never
before,
as
the
record
shows,
given
information
to
federal
narcotics
authorities
and
so
his
reliability
was
wholly
untested.
the
agents
went
to
leavenworth
street
without
a
warrant,
search
or
arrest.
one
agent
named
alton
wong,
likewise
a
chinese,
went
to
the
door
of
oye's
laundry
at
6:30
a.m.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
daylight
as
the
record
shows,
yes
sir.
the
other
agents
lurked
off
on
the
sidelines
at
positions
invisible
to
occupants
of
the
laundry.
alton
wong
rang
the
bell
and
then
he
knocked
on
the
door.
the
occupant
of
oye's
laundry
came
to
the
door.
he
is
petitioner
james
wah
toy.
petitioner
james
wah
toy
opened
the
door.
at
this
point,
agent
alton
wong
said
to
him,
“i
have
come
for
my
laundry
and
dry
cleaning.”
and
petitioner
james
wah
toy
said,
“the
laundry
doesn't
open
until
8
a.m.”
he
undertook
to
close
the
door
whereupon
agent
wong
took
out
his
badge
of
authority
and
said,
“i
am
a
federal
narcotics
officer.”
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
believe
that
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
the
record
is
not
completely
consistent
on
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
is
clear
that
petitioner
james
wah
toy
regarded
the
incident
as
closed
that
the
time
he
told
him
that
the
laundry
did
not
open
until
8
a.m.
and
it
was
at
that
juncture
that
agent
wong
flashed
the
badge
of
authority
and
petitioner
james
wah
toy
slammed
the
door
closed.
at
this
point,
the
record
shows
giving
it
the
most
favorable
inference
to
the
government
that
petitioner
toy
ran
back
through
the
laundry
to
his
living
quarters,
which
were
in
the
back
of
the
laundry
where
he
occupied
rooms
with
his
wife
and
child.
the
agent
at
this
point
broke
open
the
door,
breaking
the
lock
on
the
door,
hurried
to
the
laundry,
into
the
living
quarters
of
petitioner
toy,
into
the
room
where
his
wife
and
child
were
in
bed.
and
at
this
juncture,
james
wah
toy
reached
to
open
the
drawer
of
a
night
table
whereupon
the
agent
pulled
his
gun,
his
handcuffs
and
placed
the
petitioner
under
arrest.
now
at
this
juncture,
none
of
the
other
agents
was
present
in
the
laundry.
they,
thereafter,
came
into
the
laundry
and
the
search
was
made
of
the
laundry.
and
the
search
was
fruitless.
nothing
was
found
of
interest
to
the
narcotics
agents.
now
at
this
juncture,
i
think
i
should
also
point
out
if
the
court
please,
that
petitioner
toy
at
the
time
that
he
opened
the
door
and
at
no
time
thereafter
insofar
as
this
whole
record
shows
was
the
“blackie
toy”
referred
to
by
hom
way
because
hom
way's
role
is
completed.
and
we
never
hear
again
of
hom
way
in
this
whole
case.
he
didn't
testify
at
trial.
we
hear
his
name
not
once
more
in
the
whole
record.
and
there's
no
showing
that
the
agent
who
rang
the
bell,
who
knocked
on
the
door
had
even
been
given
the
information
that
hom
way
had
identified
“blackie
toy”
as
the
source
of
his
heroin.
and
of
course,
there
is
no
equation
of
“blackie
toy”
with
james
wah
toy
in
this
whole
record.
when
the
agents
began
interrogation
of
james
wah
toy,
the
petitioner,
in
his
bedroom,
he
was
told
that
hom
way
had
identified
him
as
the
source
of
one
ounce
of
heroin.
he
immediately
denied
his
guilt
and
responded,
“but
i
can
tell
you
where
there
are
some
narcotics.”
they
showed
interest,
the
agent
showed
interest
when
he
said,
“i
know
a
man
named
johnny
who
has
narcotics
in
his
room.”
and
he
told
the
agents
where
johnny
lived.
and
he
told
the
agents
precisely
where
the
room
in
the
house
was
which
johnny
occupied.
and
the
agents
immediately
went
to
the
place
indicated
by
petitioner
toy
where
they
arrested
one
johnny
yee.
johnny
yee,
as
the
record
shows,
immediately
surrendered
about
an
ounce
of
heroin.
and
he
was
interrogated.
this
was
at
8
a.m.
of
the
same
morning.
and
he
was
asked
with
respect
to
the
source
of
the
heroin
found
in
his
possession.
and
he
said,
“i've
got
this
heroin
from
toy”,
petitioner
toy.
“and
one
known
to
me
only
as
“sea
dog.”
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
“sea
dog.”
they
asked
him
who's
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it's
an
english
name,
yes
sir.
that's
an
anglo-saxon
version
of
a
chinese
name
as
it
turns
out,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
he
was
asked
who
“sea
dog”
was
and
he
said
he
knew
him
by
no
other
name.
and
so
the
agents
then
went
back
to
headquarters
and
they
asked
petitioner
toy
if
he
knew
a
man
named
“sea
dog.”
he
said,
“yes,
i
know
a
man
named
“sea
dog.
his
--
his
real
name
is
wong
sun.”
and
so
with
that,
the
agents
went
off
with
petitioner
toy
to
franklin
street
in
san
francisco
to
make
the
arrest
of
wong
sun.
all
of
these
arrests
of
course
being
accomplished
without
warrants
of
arrest
and
without
search
warrants.
they
went
to
the
home
on
franklin
street,
indicated
by
petitioner
toy.
they
made
entry.
they
went
to
the
bedroom
of
wong
sun.
they
found
him
sleeping.
they
arrested
him.
they
searched
and
again
the
search
was
fruitless.
now,
if
the
court
please,
petitioner
toy
and
wong
sun
were
indicted.
they
were
indicted
in
two
counts.
they
were
indicted
first
for
a
conspiracy
to
violate
title
21
of
the
united
states
code
section
174,
which
is
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
felony
to
transport
or
conceal
narcotics
or
to
facilitate
the
transportation
or
concealment
of
narcotics
knowing
the
same
to
have
been
illegally
imported.
and
they
were
likewise
indicted
for
the
substantive
violation
of
the
same
statute.
they
came
on
for
trial
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
record
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
record
shows
your
honor
that
johnny
yee
was
indicted
in
another
case
and
pleaded
guilty.
and
the
government
undertook
to
use
johnny
yee
as
a
witness
in
this
case
at
trial.
the
case
came
on
before
a
judge
without
a
jury
and
johnny
yee
was
called
as
the
government's
prime
witness.
it
was
obviously
the
intention
of
the
prosecutors
can
be
gleaned
from
this
record
to
prove
his
case
by
calling
johnny
yee
who
was
going
to
give
evidence
so
the
prosecutor
thought
against
these
petitioners
and
then
he
went
off
for
the
narcotics
inquisition
and
had
his
prima
facie
case.
however,
johnny
yee
proved
to
be
a
recalcitrant
witness.
in
fact,
he
stated
that
a
statement
that
he
had
therefore
given
was
entirely
false.
and
he
did
not
testify
against
wong
sun
or
of
petitioner
toy
in
any
respect
material
to
the
indictment
which
was
brought
against
him.
and
so
he
was
dismissed.
and
so
the
prosecutor
then
had
to
take
another
course
in
proving
this
case.
so
he
undertook
to
prove
his
case
this
way.
he
put
in
the
arrest
of
petitioner
toy
at
his
home,
combination
of
laundry
and
home.
he
showed
the
purportedly
exculpatory
statement
that
petitioner
toy
made
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
“i
have
no
narcotics
but
i
can
tell
you
where
you
can
find
some.”
then
he
showed
the
arrest
of
johnny
yee
and
he
offered
physically
into
evidence
the
narcotics
which
were
taken
at
johnny
yee's
home.
and
then,
he
offered
in
evidence
two
statements
given
by
these
petitioners
subsequent
to
their
arrest,
one
statement
by
petitioner
toy
which
was
begun
on
june
5
the
day
after
his
arrest
and
completed
on
june
9,
another
statement
which
was
made
by
wong
sun
which
was
given
on
june
9,
both
of
which
contained
incriminatory
admissions.
the
record,
if
the
court
please,
is
totally
silent
with
respect
to
any
arraignment
procedure
with
respect
to
the
two
petitioners
in
this
case.
now,
the
trial
judge
after
admitting
all
of
this
evidence
over
the
timely
and
appropriate
objections
of
trial
counsel
announced
that
he
--
it
was
his
inclination
to
find
these
petitioners
guilty
under
the
first
count
which
was
the
conspiracy
count
and
to
find
them
not
guilty
on
the
substantive
count.
but
government
counsel
quickly
pointed
out
to
the
trial
judge
that
the
government
would
feel
more
sanguine
about
its
record
on
appeal
if
he
inverted
his
verdict
and
found
the
petitioners
not
guilty
on
the
conspiracy
count
and
guilty
on
the
substantive
count
and
the
trial
judge
deferred
to
the
government's
wishes
in
this
respect
and
entered
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
on
the
conspiracy
count
and
guilty
on
the
substantive
count.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
substantive
count
your
honor
was
a
violation
of
21
u.s.c.
174
which
is
the
concealment
or
transportation
of
a
narcotic
knowing
the
same
to
have
been
illegally
imported.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
only
narcotic
in
evidence.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
were
convicted
of
the
substantive
offense
of
concealing
and/or
transporting
or
facilitating
one
or
either
with
knowledge
that
the
heroin
was
illegally
imported.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
they
were
charged
jointly
both
in
the
conspiracy
and
substantive
counts.
now,
if
the
court
please,
since
--
it
was
imposed
and
they
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
unanimously
found
that
the
arrests
of
both
petitioners
were
unlawful.
but
two
of
the
judges
refused
to
attach
any
evidentiary
consequence
to
these
unlawful
arrests.
one
judge
dissenting
from
the
majority
felt
that
the
evidence
gained
as
a
result
of
the
unlawful
arrests
should
have
been
excluded
and
that
therefore
the
convictions
should
have
been
reversed.
now,
the
government
in
this
court
undertakes
to
go
behind
the
finding,
the
unanimous
finding
of
the
ninth
circuit.
and
it
seeks
to
have
this
court
validate
those
arrests
and
therefore
obviate
the
necessity
for
deciding
the
evidentiary
question.
the
government
devotes
a
great
portion
of
its
brief
to
arguing
that
the
arrests
of
both
toy
and
wong
sun
were
lawful
and
so
to
say
that
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
and
there's
no
need
to
touch
the
evidentiary
questions.
and
therefore
it
becomes
necessary
to
discuss
these
arrests.
i
think
that
the
government's
attempt
to
validate
these
arrests
is
a
very
dramatic
attempt
at
bootstrap
levitation
because
the
government
in
its
brief
practically
concedes
that
at
the
time
that
the
agents
went
to
petitioner
toy's
premises,
they
had
no
probable
cause
for
arresting
him.
the
government
doesn't
argue
that
at
the
time
they
went
to
his
premises
at
6:30
in
the
morning
on
june
4
that
they
then
and
there
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
they
argued
that
the
events
which
took
place
at
the
premises
provide
the
link
necessary
to
support
a
finding
of
probable
cause.
they
say
that
from
the
fact
that
the
agents
went
there
that
one
of
them
knocked
on
the
door
of
petitioner
toy
at
6:30
in
the
morning
that
thereafter
when
he
attempted
to
deceive
petitioner
toy
as
to
his
purpose
for
being
there
and
that
thereafter
went
petitioner
toy
closed
the
door
and
left
that
his
hurried
departure
constituted
sufficient
to
warrant
probable
cause
for
his
arrest
at
that
juncture.
i
think
it's
significant
to
note
at
this
point
that
at
the
trial,
petitioner
toy's
use
of
the
english
language
was
so
circumscribed
that
it
was
necessary
to
use
an
interpreter
for
him
at
trial.
but
the
government
would
argue
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
the
government
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
government
argues
that
at
the
time
that
he
ran
that
there
then
arose
a
probable
cause
for
his
arrest.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
government
arg
--
the
government's
argue
--
argument
certainly
hinges
on
the
fact
that
the
departure
was
caused
by
his
identification
as
a
narcotics
agent.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
right
sir.
that's
true.
now,
of
course,
what
the
government
is
in
effect
arguing
here
is
that
the
erratic
or
emotional
behavior
of
a
victim
of
an
unlawfully
intrusion
or
an
invasion
of
rights
supplies
a
missing
link
that
was
otherwise
not
present
at
the
time
that
the
invasion
of
the
rights
took
place.
in
other
words,
the
government
is
arguing
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
this
man
reacted
first
to
the
gover
--
to
the
agent's
attempt
to
deceive
him
and
then
to
his
subsequent
state
with
that
he
was
a
narcotics
agent,
the
fact
that
he
reacted
at
6:30
in
the
morning
and
hurried
back
to
his
living
room
gives
probable
cause
for
his
arrest
where
it
theretofore
did
not
exist.
i
think
it's
most
significant
however,
to
look
at
what
the
agent
who
made
the
arrest
says
about
the
arrest
because
certainly
what
he
says
is
a
basis
for
influence
that
he
did
not
regard
that
he
had
a
probable
cause
for
arresting
toy
until
such
time
as
toy
reached
for
the
drawer
of
his
night
table
inside
of
his
bedroom.
at
page
53
of
the
record,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
colloquy,
first
at
the
top
of
the
page,
“do
you
recall
breaking
the
lock
or
breaking
the
door
in
anyway?”
he
says,
“i
did
not
break
the
door,
sir.
however,
it
was
necessary
for
government
counsel
to
stipulate
at
the
trial
that
the
door
was
broken
and
that
the
lock
was
broken.”
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
but
the
government
stipulated,
your
honor,
that
the
lock
was
broken
and
then
it
was
broken
at
the
time
that
he
went.
thereafter,
the
question
was
propounded,
“you
chased
him
down
the
hallway
into
his
bedroom?”
“yes
sir.”
“put
handcuffs
on
him
and
placed
him
under
arrest,
is
that
right?”
“not
until
he
put
his
hand
into
the
nightstand
drawer.”
“then
you
put
the
handcuffs
on
him
and
placed
him
under
arrest
and
had
drawn
your
pistol
just
before
that,
is
that
right?”
“i
had
drawn
a
pistol
because
he
reached
into
the
drawer.
i
didn't
know
what
he
had.”
now,
if
the
court
please,
over
and
above
that
there
was
clearly
a
violation
here
of
section
3109
of
title
18
which
makes
it
a
requirement
for
federal
officers
before
they
break
a
door
to
announce
the
nature
of
their
authority
and
the
purpose
of
their
visit.
not
only
did
the
officer
who
made
the
arrest
here
not
announced
the
purpose
of
his
visit,
the
purpose
of
his
presence
there
before
he
broke
the
door
but
he
actively
attempted
to
deceive
a
man
whom
he
did
not
know
to
be
the
“blackie
toy”
for
whom
he
was
looking,
a
man
who's
identity
he
did
not
know,
he
not
only
didn't
comport
with
the
statute
but
he
specifically
and
directly
violated
the
statute
by
attempting
to
perpetrate
a
ruse
on
the
occupant
of
the
premises
when
the
door
was
opened
at
6:30
in
the
morning.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
certainly
this
case
falls
within
the
purview
of
miller
against
the
united
states
decided
in
1957
by
this
court,
wherein
an
arrest
was
invalidated
because
of
failure
to
comply
with
the
statutory
requirements
imposed
upon
federal
officers
before
breaking
doors
and
entering.
again,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
ever
there
was
a
case
which
required
the
procuring
of
an
arrest
warrant
before
an
arrest
was
attempted
this
is
it,
no
reason
is
advanced
why
those
agents
after
they
listened
to
the
tale
of
hom
way
did
not
take
him
to
a
commissioner
of
the
city
of
san
francisco,
have
him
swear
to
the
state
in
which
he
had
made
to
the
officers,
get
an
arrest
warrant
and
go
to
the
premises
in
question
in
de
facto
an
arrest
with
a
warrant
on
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
toy
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
i
think
it
also
falls,
your
honor,
within
the
language
of
this
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
falls
within
the
language,
your
honor,
of
this
court.
in
fact
of
an
opinion
on
which
your
honor
wrote
the
majority
opinion
for
this
court,
jones
against
the
united
states
wherein
you
articulated
the
premise
for
the
majority
that
simply
because
an
arrest
would
have
been
lawful
had
a
warrant
been
procured
and
the
facts
were
such
that
a
warrant
could
have
been
procured
does
not
validate
that
same
arrest
when
it
is
made
without
a
warrant.
otherwise
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
otherwise
rule
4
for
his
meaningless
and
has
no
purpose
in
the
statutory
law
of
the
united
states
if
the
police
can
arrest
every
time
without
a
warrant
wherein
they
could
arrest
if
they
had
taken
the
time
to
procure
a
warrant
under
factual
situations
where
they
could
get
one.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
unders
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
feel
--
if
the
court
please,
that
if
that
statutory
requirement
has
any
meaning,
if
it
has
application
to
any
case,
certainly,
it
most
have
application
in
the
case
at
bar
because
no
reason
can
be
advanced
for
not
getting
an
arrest
warrant.
here
is
the
classic
case
for
the
submission
of
facts
to
a
judicial
or
quasi-judicial
officer
who
is
a
buffer
between
the
citizen
and
the
police.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
now
in
this
case,
the
arrest
of
wong
sun
was
accomplished
in
the
same
way.
wong
sun,
if
the
court
please,
was
arrested
upon
the
statement
of
johnny
yee,
so
far
as
the
record
goes,
johnny
yee
was
theretofore
had
known
by
the
police.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
think
that
is
quite
--
must
be
putted
in
its
frame
of
reference
and
the
frame
of
reference
embraced
in
these
facts
we're
dealing,
number
one,
with
a
man
who
finds
a
stranger
at
his
door
at
6:30
in
the
morning
who
says
he
wants
his
laundry.
we're
dealing
secondly
with
a
man
whose
illiteracy
is
demonstrated
by
the
record
here
and
whose
fluency
with
the
english
language
is
so
meager
that
it
was
necessary
to
employ
an
interpreter
before
him
at
the
trial.
thirdly,
we're
dealing
with
this
situation
that
a
badge
is
flashed
upon
him
by
a
man
theretofore
unknown
to
him
who
has
said
that
he
was
there
for
his
laundry
at
6:30
in
the
morning.
then
the
door
was
shut
giving
the
government
the
most
favorable
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
record
and
giving
it
again
the
most
favorable
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
record,
he
hurries
back
to
his
living
quarters
where
his
wife
and
child
are
sleeping.
now,
the
government
would
contend
that
his
hurrying
back
from
the
door
adds
what
is
necessary
to
supply
probable
cause.
but
they
overlooked
completely
the
fact,
if
the
court
please,
that
never
at
any
time
is
the
man
who
answered
the
door
equated
with
“blackie
toy”
who
was
named
by
hom
way,
never
at
anytime
is
this
laundry
equated
with
the
laundry
referred
to
by
hom
way.
in
fact,
the
record
shows
that
this
was
not
blackie
toy's
restaurant
or
so
designated,
it
was
oye's
restaurant
in
the
heart
of
china
town
were
presumably
there
are
many
chinese
laundries
on
a
long
street
in
the
city
of
san
francisco,
leavenworth
street.
this
happened
to
be
1733
leavenworth
street
as
the
record
shows.
so
i
say
that
it
is
bootstrap
levitation
because
they
are
engaging
in
a
wholly
gratuities
assumption
that
the
man
who
answered
the
door
against
whom
they
attempted
to
perpetrate
a
ruse
was
one
and
the
same
man
who
was
referred
to
by
hom
way
and
we
do
not
have
the
benefit
at
any
point
in
this
record
of
hom
way's
testimony
because
he
is
--
completely
disappears
once
reference
is
made
to
him
by
the
narcotics
agents.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
sir.
it's
the
same
street.
but
this
is
a
long
street
in
chinatown.
and
the
record
shows
that
this
particular
number
was
1733
of
that
street.
and
there
is
no
tie
up
here,
your
honor.
there's
no
showing
that
we're
dealing
with
one
and
the
same
person.
now,
the
government
engages,
if
the
court
please,
in
an
even
more
specious
argument
in
an
effort
to
support
the
arrest
of
wong
sun
because
they
say,
“true,
we
have
the
word
of
an
untested
informant
here
but
this
is
different
from
toy's
arrest
because
we
have
two
informants
with
respect
to
wong
sun.”
now,
who
were
those
two
informants?
one
of
them
is
johnny
yee.
johnny
yee
said
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
“i
secured
the
narcotics
from
a
fellow
known
as
“sea
dog.”
then
they
go
back
to
headquarters
and
they
asked
toy,
“do
you
know
a
man
named
“sea
dog”?”
and
he
said,
“yes,
i
know
wong
sun.”
“do
you
know
where
he
lives?”
“yes,
he
lives
in
franklin
street.”
“will
you
take
us
to
him?”
“yes.”
and
so
they
go
to
him.
they
roused
him
out
of
bed
and
arrested
him,
searched
his
premises,
find
nothing
and
the
government
says,
“this
arrest
was
alright
because
they
had
two
informants.”
they
had
one
man
who
has
said
"sea
dog"
sold
the
narcotics
and
they
had
another
man
who
said
“sea
dog”
was
wong
sun.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
makes
two,
your
--
it
makes
two,
your
honor.
and
again
i
say
this
is
of
--
this
is
an
argument
from
bootstrap
because
one
merely
identifies
as
your
honor
readily
observes
the
person
known
as
“sea
dog”
who
was
--
whose
real
name
was
unknown
to
johnny
yee.
petitioner
toy
never
said
your
honor
that
wong
sun
was
the
source
of
any
heroin
or
narcotics.
but
he
was
only
asked
who
“sea
dog”
was
so
there's
really
only
one
witness
here
which
the
government
attempts
to
argue
is
a
basis
for
a
lawful
arrest
because
the
testimony
is
in
two
parts.
now,
for
these
reasons,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
arrest
was
unlawful.
and
it's
further
our
contention
that
this
arrest
constituted
the
violation
of
the
petitioner's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
because
the
fourth
amendment
protects
persons
as
well
as
things
from
unreasonable
seizures.
and
it's
our
contention
that
this
arrest
violated
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
this
court
has
so
stated
in
both
giordenello
case
in
1959
and
in
the
hendricks
case
in
1960.
now,
since
1914,
this
court
has
attached
a
very
significant
evidentiary
cons
--
consequence
to
the
seizure
of
physical
evidence
during
an
unlawful
search.
it
has
struck
down
that
evidence
as
inadmissible
as
being
the
result
of
unlawful
police
action.
now,
i
think
that
the
basic
reason
behind
the
federal
exclusionary
rule,
the
basic
reason
for
which
it
was
adopted
was
to
discourage
and
deter
lawless
law
enforcement
because
we
recoil
at
the
concept
of
the
--
in
justifying
the
means
and
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
and
i
suppose
that
the
communist
form
of
that
thinking
is
to
forget
what
we're
trying
to
do
sometimes.
what
we're
trying
to
do
by
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
is
to
strike
down
lawless
law
enforcement
illegal
police
action.
now,
if
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
isn't
accomplished
in
that
purpose,
if
it
doesn't
accomplish
that
purpose
then
we're
paying
too
high
a
price
for
it
when
we
reverse
convictions
that
would
otherwise
have
stood.
now,
if
benefits
are
allowed
to
the
police
when
they
violate
the
legal
and
constitutional
rights
of
the
citizenry,
we
cannot
expect
that
lawless
law
enforcement
will
cease
because
it's
elementary
that
there's
no
penalty,
there's
no
sanction
that's
impose
upon
the
policeman
for
breaking
the
law
in
this
area.
the
only
thing
the
court's
can
do
is
to
make
it
unprofitable
for
them
to
do
this.
and
the
only
way
that
the
court's
can
make
it
unprofitable
for
the
policeman
to
do
this
is
to
strike
down
both
the
indirect
and
the
derivative
benefits
that
flow
from
invasion
of
constitutional
rights
and
from
the
invasion
of
the
lawful
rights
of
the
citizenry.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
but
if
we
take
an
inconsistent
position
and
we
allow
verbal
evidence
which
is
secured
as
the
result
of
an
unlawful
arrest
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
articulated
over
the
past
16
years
in
the
line
of
cases
that
we
referred
to
as
the
mcnabb,
upshaw
mallory
line
of
cases.
the
fact
that
notwithstanding
a
confession
maybe
voluntarily
made
if
it
is
caused
by
illegal
federal
police
action
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
it
is
inadmissible.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
so
that
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
so
that
notwithstanding
there
may
be
a
free
exercise
of
the
volitional
facet
of
the
arrested
party's
mind.
that
is
struck
down.
now,
the
government
would
argue
that
because
toy
didn't
have
to
speak
because
he
spoke
freely
that
the
evidence
should
go
in,
when
i
say
this
is
at
war
with
the
whole
line
of
cases
wherein
this
court
has
struck
down
voluntarily
made
statements
because
the
police
violated
the
statutory
right.
then
i
say
the
reason
has
far
more
force
and
cogency
when
you
have
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
as
you
have
here.
and
that's
what
we
have
here,
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
and
a
statement
made
by
petitioner
toy
at
the
threshold
of
his
detention.
and
of
course,
we
must
recognize
that
the
mcnabb,
upshaw
and
mallory
cases
have
created
a
pressure
on
the
federal
police
to
get
threshold
confessions
on
the
premise
that
confessions
obtained
thereafter
maybe
inadmissible
because
of
the
statutory
breach.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
do
rely
on
the
fruit's
doctrine,
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
i
do
rely
on
the
fruit's
doctrine.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
referred
to
the
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
mcnabb-mallory
line
of
cases
in
this
frame
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
argument
that
voluntariness
of
the
victim
necessarily
--
it
breaks
the
causal
niche
of
police
illegality
doesn't
hold
because
this
court
has
given
birth
to
a
line
of
cases
where
the
voluntariness
of
the
victim
in
the
phase
of
the
violation
of
his
legal
rights
has
not
caused
him
to
forfeit
his
legal
position
because
government
argues
in
its
brief
that
the
fact
that
toy
didn't
have
to
speak,
the
fact
that
he
could've
remained
silent
and
that
he
chose
to
speak
and
exculpate
himself
in
the
phase
of
this
arrest
breaks
the
chain
of
causality
between
the
illegal
action
of
the
police
and
the
evidence
which
is
sought
to
be
admitted
and
that
can't
be
squared
with
mcnabb,
upshaw,
mallory
line
of
cases.
but
i
do
rely
on
the
fruit
doctrine,
mr.
justice
harlan
because
as
a
result
of
the
nardone
cases,
the
federal
courts
throughout
the
land
have
taken
the
position
that
evidence
which
is
secured
as
the
result
of
wiretaps
may
not
offered
in
a
federal
courtroom
so
that
if
police
tap
my
wire
and
hear
my
discussion
with
x.
and
as
a
result
of
hearing
my
discussion
with
x,
they
learnt
the
identity
of
y
and
they
therefore
find
that
y
is
a
witness
who
can
give
evidence
against
me.
they
have
no
other
source
of
--
to
y
except
the
wiretap,
the
court's
have
consistently
struck
down
the
testimony
of
y
as
being
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
notwithstanding
mr.
justice
stewart
that
y
voluntarily
agrees
to
testify
after
he
is
found.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
has
this
to
do
with
my
argument
that
i
think
it
completely
again
says
what
the
government
says
in
its
brief
and
what
i
assume
it
will
argue
in
this
court
that
the
voluntariness
of
a
victim's
action
necessarily
breaks
the
chain
of
causality
between
the
government's
illegal
action
and
the
statement
that
he
makes
because
in
all
the
mcnabb
line
of
cases,
the
statement
is
voluntary
yet
it's
inadmissible.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i'm
saying
that
the
same
philosophical
rationale
applies
here.
the
reason
as
i
understand
the
mallory
line
of
cases
is
to
discourage
the
police
from
illegally
detaining
the
arrested
victims
and
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
recessed
on
last
thursday,
we
were
discussing
the
evidentiary
consequences
of
the
unlawful
arrest
of
petitioner,
toy.
specifically,
we
were
discussing
the
admissibility
of
the
oral
statement
which
he
made
immediately
after
his
arrest
in
his
home.
that
statement,
you
will
recall,
was
a
denial
of
the
fact
that
he
had
sold
narcotics
to
one
hom
way,
and
a
further
statement
to
the
narcotics
officers
that
he
knew
were
there
was
some
heroin
namely
in
the
home
of
one
johnny,
whom
we
later
learned
to
be
a
johnny
yee.
it
is
our
contention
if
the
court
please,
that
since
the
arrest
of
petitioner
toy
was
unlawful,
his
detention
was
unlawful
ab
initio.
and
since
his
detention
was
unlawful
ab
initio,
the
statement
which
was
offered
against
him
at
his
trial
was
a
statement
made
during
his
unlawful
detention.
this
court,
in
a
line
of
cases
since
1943,
has
held
that
statements
made
by
an
accused
during
a
period
of
unlawful
detention
are
inadmissible
against
him
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
they
were
obtained
in
violation
of
a
statutory
right.
it
is
our
contention
if
the
court
please,
that
a
fortiori
statements
made
during
a
period
of
illegal
detention
brought
about
by
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
should
be
rendered
inadmissible
by
this
court.
now,
just
as
physical,
tangible
and
visible
evidence
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
had
been
held
to
be
inadmissible
by
the
court
so
too
unequivocally,
this
court
held
last
year
in
the
case
of
silverman
against
the
united
states
that
verbal,
oral
evidence
is
likewise
protected
within
the
fourth
amendment.
and
if
this
evidence
has
seized
in
violation
of
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
rights,
it
is
likewise
excludable.
now,
our
research,
if
the
court
please,
has
found
only
two
cases
in
all
of
federal
jury's
prudence
that
are
apposite
to
the
case
at
bar,
none
from
this
court.
in
1940,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
had
before
in
a
case
on
all
force
with
this.
the
decision
was
written
by
judge
vinson
for
unanimous
court
including
chief
judge
groner
and
judge
edgerton.
the
facts
were
these.
a
taxi
cab
at
1
o'clock
in
the
morning
struck
a
parked
car.
the
taxi
cab
was
abandoned
by
its
driver.
the
police
came
on
the
scene.
they
found
the
registration
in
the
taxi
cab,
and
they
went
to
the
home
of
the
appellant.
they
made
an
unlawful
entry
into
his
home.
they
went
to
the
second
floor,
they
found
him.
and
he
immediately
admitted
that
he
had
been
driving
the
car
which
was
involved
in
the
accident.
the
question
before
the
appeals'
court
was
whether
that
statement,
that
oral
statement
made
as
the
result
of
an
unlawful
entry
might
be
admitted
against
him
in
his
trial
for
drunk
and
driving.
and
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
held
that
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
exclusionary
rule,
which
came
into
being
in
1914
in
the
weeks
case,
rendered
that
oral
statement
inadmissible
against
him
and
struck
down
the
evidence
as
having
been
obtained
through
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
again,
in
a
case
exactly
in
point
with
the
case
at
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
bar
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
turned
out
if
the
court
please
that
in
this
case,
of
course,
that
statement
made
by
the
petitioner
was
used
as
one
of
the
most
cogent
pieces
of
incriminatory
evidence
against
toy
because
that
is
the
precise
statement
upon
which
the
government
relies
as
corroborative
of
a
subsequent
alleged
confession.
so
i
feel
if
the
court
please
that
that
was,
as
used
by
the
government,
an
incriminatory
statement
within
the
purview
of
the
fifth
as
well
as
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
because
of
the
use
to
which
it
was
put
by
the
government
at
his
trial
and
the
use
to
which
it's
put
before
this
court
what
it's
argued
by
the
government
that
it
is
corroborative,
corroborative
evidence
of
a
subsequent
confession.
now,
the
case
of
somer
against
the
united
states
is
even
closer.
that
case
was
decided
in
1943
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
judge
learned
hand
wrote
for
unanimous
court.
the
facts
were
these.
agents
of
the
alcoholic
tax
unit
entered
the
apartment
of
one
somer
in
brooklyn,
new
york.
they
found
there
his
wife
and
they
found
a
steel
in
operation.
his
wife
said
to
the
officers
who
arrested
her
that
her
husband
would
be
home
in
20
minutes.
and
so
they
went
downstairs
and
stood
in
front
of
the
building
and
awaited
the
return
of
appellant
somer.
somer
came
along
in
his
car
20
minutes
later,
and
there
was
whiskey
in
the
backseat.
he
was
arrested
and
the
whiskey
was
seized.
he
went
to
trial.
a
motion
was
filed
to
suppress
the
evidence.
the
trial
judge
did
in
fact
suppress
the
evidence
found
in
the
apartment
on
the
ground
that
it
was
gained
as
a
result
of
an
unlawful
entry
and
unlawful
arrest.
but
the
trial
court
refused
to
suppress
the
evidence
found
outside
in
the
automobile
of
--
of
appellant
somer.
when
the
case
went
to
the
second
circuit,
judge
hand
writing
for
unanimous
court
found
that
if
the
police
had
gone
down
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
waited
for
somer
because
of
the
information
which
they
received
from
mrs.
somer
resulting
from
their
unlawful
entry
that
it
could
not
be
admitted
against
the
appellant
somer.
and
it
sent
the
case
back
to
the
lower
court
for
determination
as
to
whether
that
was
the
sole
motivating
force
which
impelled
the
police
to
go
downstairs
and
wait
for
his
return.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
feel
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
feel,
if
the
court
please,
that
on
this
record,
there
is
causal
relationship
between
the
unlawful
entry
and
the
statement.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
am
not
attacking
as
its
being
coerced
expect
insofar
as
an
unlawful
arrest
as
elements
of
coercion
in
it.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
true.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that
is
true
your
honor
but
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
of
course,
have
to
say
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
say
two
things
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
number
one,
that
the
police
should
not
profit
from
their
own
wrongdoing
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
the
--
and
this
would
be
profiting
from
their
own
wrongdoing
because
it
is
caused
by
an
illegal
arrest.
i
say
secondly
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
is
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it's
the
end
of
the
sentence
but
it's
not
the
end
of
my
thought,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it's
an
argument
by
itself
but
i
rely
upon
an
additional
argument,
sir
because
i
will
not
waive
the
fact
that
in
arrest
has
elements
of
coercion
when
the
arrest
is
unlawfully
made.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
am
saying
exactly
that
mr
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
justice
frankfurter
unless
the
effect
of
the
involuntarily
arrest
is
terminated
in
one
of
three
ways
that
occurred
to
me,
by
his
arraignment,
by
representation
of
counsel
or
by
his
release.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
understand,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
why
i
haven't
abandoned
that
mr.
chief
justice.
i
haven't
abandoned
that
argument.
i
feel
very
strongly
that
that
is
another
element
which
must
be
considered
as
a
factor
in
determining
whether
this
statement
should
be
excluded.
but
i
do
say
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
yes,
sir
that
is
my
position.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that
if
it
is
made
during
illegal
detention,
it
goes
out
on
the
same
rational
as
it
went
out
under
the
edict
of
this
court
in
the
mallory
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
too
as
far
as
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
subscribe
to
that
on
that
view.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
now,
the
government,
if
the
court
please,
has
cited
three
cases
as
supporting
its
position,
presumably
a
counsel
has
combed
the
whole
field
of
federal
decisions
in
an
effort
to
bolster
his
position
here.
and
he
cites
three
cases,
smith
against
the
united
states
decided
in
this
circuit
in
1958.
i
refer
to
the
district
of
columbia.
that
case
does
not
support
the
government's
position
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
smith
case
found
the
arrest
to
have
been
lawful,
and
it
distinguished
the
smith
case
from
the
nueslein
case.
it
specifically
said
the
arrest
is
lawful
in
any
consolation
that
the
government
may
get
in
this
case
comes
from
dictum.
the
case
of
united
states
against
walker
which
came
out
of
the
second
circuit
in
1952
is
cited
by
the
government.
again,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
specifically
said
that
the
appellant
had
failed
to
prove
that
the
arrest
was
illegal,
and
so
i
say
that
that
case
likewise
is
not
apposite.
and
finally,
he
cites
a
case
in
1945
which
likewise
came
out
of
this
circuit
called
gibson
against
the
united
states.and
the
government
fails
to
distinguish
between
two
counts
in
an
indictment.
one
of
which
was
struck
down
and
one
of
which
was
not.
the
one
which
was
not
struck
down,
which
was
affirmed,
was
supported
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
after
the
appellant
had
been
unlawfully
arrested
and,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
after
he
had
been
released,
he
--he
then
made
a
statement
to
the
police
when
he
came
to
headquarters
the
next
day
and
said,
“i
have
more
marijuana
in
another
apartment.”
and
of
course
since
a
release
had
terminated
the
effect
of
the
illegal
detention,
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
circuit
permitted
it.
now,
we
likewise
say
that
the
narcotic
seized
in
the
apartment
of
yee
was
in
admissible
as
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
within
the
purview
of
the
nardone
decision
and
the
silverthorne
decision.
and
finally
we
say
that
the
confessions
which
were
given
on
the
fifth
and
ninth
of
the
month,
some
days
after,
were
inadmissible
because
the
record
is
absolutely
salient
with
respect
to
any
arraignment
in
this
case.
the
only
thing
that
appears
about
an
arraignment
is
the
statement
made
on
page
6
of
the
government's
brief
where
the
government
says
that
the
petitioners
were
arraign
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
it.
now,
in
that
statement
appeared
in
government's
brief,
since
it
was
unsupported
by
the
record,
we
wrote
to
san
francisco
to
determine
the
facts
of
the
arraignment.
the
facts
of
the
arraignment
time-wise
are
as
represented
by
the
government.
but
the
facts
of
the
arraignment
show
that
at
the
time
of
the
arraignment,
warrants
of
arrest
were
issued
on
complaints
by
the
officers.
i
think
that
that
is
the
demonstrative
of
the
fact
that
at
least
in
the
arresting
officers'
minds,
they
did
not
have
valid
basis
for
those
arrest
without
a
warrant,
which
had
been
consummated
many
hours
before.
finally,
there
is
one
question
which
i
think
is
dispositive
of
the
case
apart
from
the
evidentiary
consequences
of
the
unlawful
arrest.
and
that
is,
that
it
has
been
hornbook
law,
articulated
by
this
court
many
times
that
a
confession
cannot
support
a
conviction
standing
alone.
it
must
be
corroborated.
each
element
to
the
offense
must
be
corroborated.
there
is
no
corroborative
evidence
in
this
record
with
respect
to
these
petitioners
because
the
only
evidence
apart
from
the
confession
is
number
one,
toy's
statement
that
there
were
narcotics
in
the
possession
of
yee,
number
two,
the
narcotics
found
in
yee's
possession
and
number
three,
yee
statement
that
he
knew
toy
and
sun.
but
there
is
no
evidence,
number
one,
that
either
petitioner
concealed
the
narcotic,
transported
the
narcotic,
knew
that
the
narcotic
was
illegally
imported
or
that
either
petitioner
possessed
the
narcotic.
the
statute
says
that
possession
alone
will
support
a
conviction.
that
is
true,
a
conviction
against
the
possessor
but
not
against
someone
who
is
not
the
possessor
and
he
--
who
is
not
related
to
the
possessor
in
a
conspiratorial
relationship
and
these
men
were
acquitted
on
the
count
of
conspiracy.
and
so
i
say
for
that
reason,
these
convictions
cannot
stand
under
smith
against
the
united
states
which
made
it
a
requisite
that
a
confession
be
corroborated
with
respect
to
every
element
of
the
offense.
now,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
there
is
one
fatal
flaw
in
the
argument
made
by
the
government
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
petitioner
toy's
arrests.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
nowhere
in
the
record
is
there
an
equation
of
blackie
toy
who
was
mentioned
by
hom
way
with
petitioner
toy.
the
solicitor
conceded
that
if
alton
wong
was
at
the
door
of
oye's
laundry
at
6:30
in
the
morning
without
reason
then
the
flight
of
the
men
who
opened
and
response
to
his
knock
would
be
meaningless
insofar
as
probable
cause
is
concerned.
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
there
was
no
reason
nor
could
there
have
been
for
alton
wong,
the
narcotics
agent
to
believe
that
the
man
who
opened
the
door
of
oye's
laundry
at
6:30
in
the
morning
was
the
man
who
was
mentioned
by
hom
way.
he
was
told
by
hom
way
and
in
fact
he
was
the
agent
who
was
so
told
another
was
that
the
narcotic
was
bought
at
a
laundry
on
leavenworth
street
from
blackie
toy.
i
think
this
court
can
judicially
notice
because
it
is
the
fact
demonstrable
from
a
map
that
leavenworth
street
is
several
miles
long
and
it
runs
through
the
heart
of
chinatown
in
the
northeast
section
of
san
francisco.
the
laundry
was
not
known
as
toy's
laundry
but
oye's
laundry.
when
he
rang
the
bell
and
a
man
opened
the
door,
he
had
no
reason
in
the
world
to
believe
that
the
man
who
opened
the
door
in
response
to
his
knock
and
ring
was
the
blackie
toy
mentioned
by
hom
way.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
record
is
silent
on
that
and
i
don't
think.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don't
think
we
can
reason
from
hindsight
as
the
solicitor
attempted
to
do
to
the
validity
of
the
arrest.
he
says
that
fact
that
the
defendant
ended
up
as
the
petitioner
ended
up
as
the
defendant
would
justify
there
going
there.
i
don't
think
that
can
be
made.
and
the
record
also
shows,
if
the
court
please
that
james
wah
toy,
and
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
36,
testified
through
an
interpreter.
again,
if
the
court
please,
the
solicitor
said
that
the
facts
as
they
confronted
alton
wong,
the
agent,
should
be
the
decisive
in
this
matter.
well,
the
fact
as
they
confronted
alton
wong
are
well
revealed
at
page
53
in
the
record
where
he
testified
that
the
arrest
and
the
seizure
and
the
taking
into
custody
of
the
petitioner
was
accomplished
after
he
got
into
the
room,
and
certainly
it
is
a
reasonable
and
i
think
the
only
reasonable
inference
that
the
arrest
was
made
was
because
the
petitioner
reached
for
his
nightstand.
now,
finally,
if
the
court
please,
the
solicitor
said
that
an
arraignment
took
place
in
this
case.there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
an
arraignment.
it
is
absolutely
silent.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
believe
that
that
is
so.
i
believe
an
arraignment
took
place.
the
record
is
silent
on
it.
but
if
we
are
going
to
accept
the
fact
that
the
arraignment,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
we
must
accept
all
of
the
facts
concerning
the
arraignment
and
when
he
made
the
representation
in
his
brief
that
an
arraignment
took
place,
we
secured
the
records
and
the
records
of
the
arraignment
showed
that
the
arrest
of
these
two
men
were
accomplished
by
warrant
issued
by
the
commissioner.
now,
the
solicitor
says,
this
lands
itself
to
one
of
two
inferences,
either
that
there
was
no
arrest
made
in
toy's
bedroom,
and
that
the
arrest
was
not
made
until
he
was
taken
before
the
commissioner
or
alternatively
that
an
arrest
was
made
there
and
a
new
arrest
was
made
at
the
commissioner's.
if
there
was
no
arrest
made
or
the
warrants
didn't
issue
until
they
appeared
before
the
commissioner,
if
the
court
please,
and
complaints
were
sworn
to
by
the
narcotics
agents.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
had
already
been
of
course
early
that
morning
and
they've
taken
this
man
into
custody
insofar
as
the
record
shows.
in
other
words,
the
agents
here,
the
testimony
of
the
agents,
i
think
is
certainly
contradictory
to
the
record
of
the
commissioner.
now,
if
it
is
the
fact
that
they
were
not
arrested,
if
toy
was
not
arrested,
then
how
in
the
name
of
reason
can
the
breaking
in
of
his
door
be
justified
at
6:30
in
the
morning?
and
the
solicitor
concedes
that
the
papers
on
the
arraignment
are
ambiguous
with
respect
to
whether
the
arrest
was
accomplished
on
his
premises
or
thereafter
at
the
commissioner's
office
where
a
warrant
was
issued
because
these
arraignment
papers
clearly
show
that
the
arrest
was
accomplished
with
a
warrant
and
not
without
a
warrant
contrary
to
the
testimony
given
at
the
trial
by
the
agents
in
justifying
the
admissibility
of
all
the
evidence
which
went
in.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
concede,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
if
an
arraignment
took
place
and
if
we
accept
this
extra
record
fact
that
the
confessions
were
admissible.
i
will
concede
that,
because
i
believe
that
an
arraignment
or
representation
of
counsel
or
the
release
of
the
defendants
breaks
the
chain
of
causality
between
the
illegal
police
act
and
the
subsequent
evidence
that
is
obtained.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
is
not
this
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
is
not
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
you
accept
the
fact
that
the
agents
went
through
a
meaningless
act
in
front
of
the
commissioner.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
oh,
there
would
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
validity
of
arrest
after
the
warrant
was
issued
but
it
doesn't
remove
the
cloud
of
doubt
over
the
question
with
which
we
are
concerned
here
as
to
whether
or
not
the
detention
of
these
men
was
legal
prior
to
their
appearance
before
the
commissioner.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
i
think
if
the
court
please
that
there
has
been
no
answer
to
our
position,
no
answer
to
our
position
that
where
you
have
unlawful
detention
here
in
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
as
we
contend
there
was
here.
certainly,
there
is
stronger
reason
for
the
exclusion
of
evidence
obtained
during
that
detention
than
there
is
in
the
mallory
line
of
cases
where
there
was
a
violation
of
statutory
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
narcotics
would
not
have
been
admitted
nor
would
the
statement
of
toy
that
either
narcotic
could
be
found
at
his
house.
and
there
would
then
be
no
corroboration
whatsoever.
our
contention
is
now
there
is
not
corroboration
sufficient
to
stand
a
conviction
but
all
corroboration
would
be
gone
under
that
hypothesis.
we
don't
concede
for
the
purpose
of
this
that
there
was
an
arraignment
because
the
record
is
silent
on
it,
but
if
the
fact,
they
represented
by
the
government,
and
i
don't
again
say
that
for
a
moment
that
they
are
making
their
statement
in
good
faith.
if
that
is
accepted
as
a
fact
and
i
think
all
of
the
facts
must
be
accepted
with
respect
to
the
arraignment
namely
that
an
arrest
was
perpetrated
at
this
time.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
ask
that
the
--
the
convictions
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
be
reversed.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
this
morning
for
reargument.
i
think
it
would
be
useful
and
helpful
to
the
court
if
i
reset
the
factual
backdrop
against
which
the
legal
issues
are
framed
at
the
very
outset.
on
june
4
of
1959,
in
the
city
of
san
francisco,
federal
narcotics
agents
arrested
one
hom
way
at
2
a.m.
in
the
morning.
he
was
found
to
be
in
possession
of
one
ounce
of
heroin.
he
was
taken
to
federal
narcotics
headquarters
in
the
city
of
san
francisco
in
the
date
of
night
and
he
was
interrogated
there
through
the
night
until
at
5:30
a.m.
he
stated
that
he
had
obtained
the
heroin,
which
was
found
in
his
possession,
from
a
man
named
“blackie
toy”
who
operated
a
laundry
on
leavenworth
street
in
the
city
of
san
francisco.
federal
narcotics
agents
then
left
narcotics
headquarters
accompanied
by
local
police,
they
were
altogether
seven
in
number.
and
they
went
to
leavenworth
street.
while
six
of
them
worked
off
in
the
distance,
the
federal
agent
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
they
were
in
different
positions,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
some
were
as
far
as
100
yards
away
but
they
were
not
within
hearing
of
what
took
place
subsequently
at
the
door
of
the
laundry
if
that's
the
thrust
of
your
question.
federal
agent
alton
wong
went
to
the
door
of
a
laundry
designated
as
oye's,
o-y-e-s
laundry
at
1733
leavenworth
street.
he
rang
the
bell,
and
he
beat
on
the
door
and
he
aroused
the
occupant
who
used
the
back
of
the
laundry
as
his
living
quarters.
the
occupant
came
to
the
door
at
approximately
6:30
in
the
morning
and
agent
alton
wong
said,
“i
have
come
for
my
laundry.”
the
occupant
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
daylight
in
san
francisco,
yes
sir.
the
occupant
of
the
premises
who
turned
out
to
be
petitioner
james
wah
toy
in
this
case
said
to
agent
wong,
“the
laundry
opens
at
eight
o'clock,
come
back
then.”
at
which
point
agent
wong
flashed
a
badge
and
said,
“i'm
a
federal
narcotics
agent.”
petitioner
toy
slammed
the
door
and
the
record
shows
he
hurried
through
the
laundry
back
to
his
living
quarters
behind
the
laundry,
at
which
point
agent
alton
wong
broke
in
the
door
and
followed
him
in
hot
pursuit.
they
ran
back
into
the
bedroom
which
was
occupied
by
petitioner
toy,
his
wife
and
infant
child,
and
there
petitioner
toy
reached
into
a
night
table
opened
the
drawer
at
which
point
alton
wong
pulled
his
pistol,
pulled
out
handcuffs,
and
placed
petitioner
toy
under
arrest.
this
arrest
was
effected
without
a
warrant.
no
warrant
was
issued
in
this
case,
search
or
arrest.
the
other
agent
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
was
nothing
in
the
drawer,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
fact,
the
other
agents
then
began
a
systematic
search
of
the
premises
and
the
search
uncovered
no
contraband
of
any
kind.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
weapons,
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
at
this
juncture,
petitioner
toy
was
confronted
with
the
accusation
that
had
theretofore
been
made
by
him
a
--
against
him
by
hom
way,
and
i
think
it's
a
worthy
of
mention
in
passing
that
this
significantly
enough
is
the
last
we
hear
of
hom
way
in
this
whole
record.
he
never
appears
as
a
witness.
there
is
no
further
reference
to
him
in
the
trial
transcript
or
at
any
stage
in
the
record.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
harlan,
to
support
an
inference
either
way
with
respect
to
that
fact.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
make
no
argument
with
respect
to
hom
way's
arrest.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
sir.
the
sole
witness
produced
by
the
government
at
the
trial
was
one
johnny
yee
who
turned
out
to
be
a
recalcitrant
witness
testified
to
nothing
incriminatory
against
the
petitioners
and
was
excused
by
the
prosecutor.
now,
after
petitioner
toy
was
confronted
with
these
accusations,
he
denied
that
he
had
sold
any
heroin
to
hom
way
but
he
immediately
stated,
“i
know
where
you
can
find
some
heroin.
there's
a
man
named
johnny
--”
and
he
described
his
premises
on
eleventh
avenue
in
the
city
of
san
francisco.
he
says,
“he
had
some
heroin
in
his
apartment.
whereupon
the
agents
left
the
laundry
on
leavenworth
street
and
they
went
to
eleventh
avenue
to
the
place
indicated
by
petitioner
toy
and
they
entered
those
premises
at
approximately
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning.
they
went
to
the
room
in
which
johnny
yee
was
sleeping.
they
placed
him
under
arrest
and
they
recovered
there
27
grams
of
heroin.
yee
was
then
taken
to
federal
narcotics
headquarters
and
yee
was
interrogated
by
narcotics
agents
with
respect
to
his
source
of
supply
whereupon
yee
stated,
“i
received
this
heroin
from
james
wah
toy
and
from
a
man
known
to
me
only
as
“sea
dog.”
the
agents
then
went
back
to
petitioner
james
wah
toy
and
they
asked
him
if
he
knew
anyone
known
as
“sea
dog”
and
he
said,
“yes,
i
know
a
man
named
wong
sun,”
who
is
referred
to
as
“sea
dog”
whereupon
he
led
the
officers
to
the
residence
of
wong
sun
on
franklin
street
in
the
city
of
san
francisco.
the
agents
entered
wong
sun's
house
went
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
where
has
was
sleeping,
he
was
placed
under
arrest,
a
systematic
search
was
made
at
his
dwelling
house
and
no
contraband
was
found.
this
arrest
was
likewise
effected
without
a
warrant
although
it
was
effected
in
this
instance
at
10:30
in
the
morning.
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
they
were
held
under
arrest
and
yee
was
interrogated
and
of
course
it
was
his
interrogation
which
produced
ultimately
the
arrest
of
wong
sun.
now,
the
record
is
absolutely
silent
with
respect
to
an
arraignment
of
these
petitioners.
because
of
the
fact
that
the
government
made
a
statement
in
its
brief
wholly
without
record
foundation
that
an
arraignment
had
been
made,
when
we
were
appointed
in
this
case,
we
undertook
to
find
out
if
there
had
been
an
arraignment.
and
if
the
court
will
recall
at
the
end
of
the
argument
last
april,
we
were
asked
to
submit
such
documents
as
we
had
been
able
to
recover
which
reflected
the
arraignment
of
toy
and
sun,
and
those
were
presented
to
the
court
and
i
will
have
reference
to
them
later
on
in
my
discussion
of
the
evidentiary
question
here.
sufficed
to
say
at
this
time
that
statements
were
made
by
petitioner
wong
sun
and
by
petitioner
wah
toy,
they
were
transcribed
by
narcotics
agents
and
they
were
presented
to
the
petitioners
for
signature.
the
petitioners
refused
to
sign
the
statements,
but
ultimately,
they
became
evidence
at
the
trial,
offered
orally
by
the
agents
who
took
them.
now,
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
wasn't
necessary
for
them
to
break
in
because
an
occupant
of
those
premises
permitted
them
to
enter,
yes
sir.
but
they
did
go
to
his
bedroom
where
he
was
sleeping
and
placed
him
under
arrest
and
then
made
a
systematic
search
of
his
premises.
there
was
not
a
breaking
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
stewart.
now,
the
petitioners
were
indicted
for
violation
of
title
21
section
174
of
the
united
states
code
which
is
that
section
which
makes
it
a
felony
to
conceal,
to
transport,
to
facilitate
transportation,
to
buy
or
sell
narcotics
knowing
them
to
have
been
illegally
imported.
they
were
indicted
in
the
first
count
for
a
conspiracy
to
commit
this
offense,
toy
and
sun,
and
in
the
second
count
for
the
substantive
offense
itself.
the
case
came
on
for
trial
and
it
was
the
intention
of
the
prosecutor
to
prove
his
case
by
calling
the
witness
yee
and
using
the
viva
voce
testimony
of
yee.
yee
was
caught.
yee
took
the
stand
and
yee
proved
to
be
a
recalcitrant
witness.
he
testified
to
nothing
whatsoever
incriminatory
vis-à-vis
either
petitioner
whereupon
he
was
confronted
with
a
statement
that
he
had
purportedly
made
previously
and
he
was
asked
whether
or
not
the
facts
as
contained
in
that
statement
were
true
and
he
rejected
them
and
described
them
as
a
pack
of
lies.
he
was
then
excused
from
the
stand
and
so
it
was
necessary
for
the
prosecutor
to
take
a
different
tack
to
make
a
prima
facie
case.
he
then
undertook
to
make
a
prima
facie
case
this
way.
he
showed
the
fact
of
the
arrest
of
petitioner
toy.
he
showed
the
statement
made
on
the
threshold
of
that
arrest
namely
that
narcotics
could
be
found
in
yee's
apartment.
he
then
showed
the
arrest
of
yee
and
the
recovery
of
the
narcotics
in
yee's
apartment.
he
placed
those
narcotics
physically
in
evidence
and
offered
two
statements
made
subsequently
by
the
then
defendants
now
petitioners
which
were
offered
as
incriminating
admissions
and
he
rested.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
statements,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
have
printed
in
our
supplemental
brief.
in
essence,
james
wah
toy
conceded
that
on
several
occasions
he
had
driven
petitioner
wong
sun
to
the
premises
of
johnny
yee
and
he
conceded
that
narcotics
were
handed
from
sun
to
yee
and
that
he
himself
had
smoked
some
heroin
on
those
visits.
with
respect
to
petitioner
sun,
sun
conceded
that
he
had
transported
narcotics
to
yee
and
had
sold
narcotics
to
yee
and
that
after
the
sale
was
consummated
on
each
of
several
occasions
that
they
had
participated
in
a
friendly
smoke.
now,
with
respect
to
the
finding
by
the
trial
judge,
he
indicated
that
it
was
his
disposition
first
of
all
to
find
the
defendants
guilty
of
the
conspiracy
count
and
not
guilty
of
the
substantive
count
but
because
the
prosecutor
represented,
he
would
be
more
sanguine
for
purposes
of
appeal
if
the
converse
were
done,
the
judge
obliged
--
obliged
and
he
found
them
guilty
of
the
substantive
offense
and
not
guilty
of
the
conspiracy
offense
and
ultimately
that
case
was
taken
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
and
that
court
unanimously
found
that
both
arrests
were
effected
unlawfully.
but
two
of
the
judges
refused
to
attach
any
evidentiary
consequences
to
the
illegal
arrest
and
so
the
convictions
were
affirmed.
and
it's
in
that
posture
that
the
case
is
before
this
court
this
morning.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
not
a
jury
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yee
was
named,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
conspiracy
count
but
not
as
a
defendant,
as
a
coconspirator.
and
the
record
shows
that
he
was
indicted
in
a
separate
--
in
a
separate
case
and
that
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty.
that's
all
that
appears
in
the
record
on
that
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
arrests
of
both
petitioners
were
unlawfully
effected.
there
is
no
finding
by
either
lower
court
that
the
arrests
were
lawful.
even
the
trial
judge
avoided
that
finding
because
you
can
search
the
record
and
you
find
no
rationale
for
his
admission
of
the
contested
evidence
into
the
record
at
no
point
does
he
say
the
arrest
were
lawful.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
found
unanimously
that
the
arrests
were
unlawfully
affected.
now,
the
government
seeks
to
go
behind
those
findings
and
have
the
arrest
validated
by
this
court
so
that
the
evidentiary
question
may
be
avoided.
now,
with
respect
to
the
arrest,
the
government
does
not
contend
or
indeed
couldn't
contend
reasonably
that
on
the
mere
statement
of
hom
way
federal
agents
had
the
right
to
go
place
petitioner
toy
under
arrest.
the
record
is
very
clear
that
hom
way
was
an
untested
informant.
he
had
never
before
given
information
to
federal
narcotics
agents.
he
made
a
statement
when
he
was
in
custody.
and
the
government
does
not
allege
that
this
constituted
a
probable
cause
for
arrest.
what
does
the
government
say?
the
government
contends
that
probable
cause
arose
when
alton
wong
went
to
the
door
of
oye's
laundry,
knocked
on
the
door
and
when
the
occupant
of
those
premises
fled
through
the
laundry
back
to
his
living
quarters.
that
contends
the
government
provided
the
indispensable
link
to
making
probable
cause
for
an
unlawful
arrest.
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
at
page
28
of
the
government's
brief,
i
believe
that
the
language,
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
second
paragraph,
is
a
basis
for
what
i've
said
that
they
are
not
making
the
contention
that
hom
way's
statement
standing
alone
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
arrest.
now,
i
think
it's
necessary
to
look
at
this
episode
in
its
proper
frame
of
reference.
first
of
all,
at
the
time
that
the
agents
went
to
leavenworth
street,
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
laundry,
which
alton
wong
approached,
was
the
laundry
referred
to
by
hom
way,
it
was
a
different
name,
it
was
oye's
laundry.
hom
way
had
not
given
the
address.
leavenworth
street
is
one
of
the
longest
streets
in
san
francisco,
presumably,
insofar
as
this
record
is
concerned,
those
agents
were
engaged
in
a
systematic
investigation
of
chinese
laundries
on
leavenworth
street.
and
so
when
they
knocked
at
the
door
and
the
occupant
came,
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
man
who
opened
that
door
was
the
‘blackie
toy'
referred
to
by
hom
way
and
they
didn't
ask.
alton
wong
didn't
asked
are
you
--
are
you
‘blackie
toy'
or
are
you
mr.
toy?
instead
of
that,
not
knowing
that
he
was
at
the
premises
referred
to
by
his
untested
informant,
not
knowing
that
the
occupant
who
answered
the
door
was
the
‘blackie
toy'
who
was
referred
to
by
his
untested
informant,
he
undertaken
--
undertook
immediately
to
perpetrate
a
ruse
on
him.
and
instead
of
saying,
“are
you
blackie
toy?
i
have
come
here
to
ask
you
questions.
i'm
a
narcotics
agent.”
he
said,
“i've
come
here
to
get
my
laundry
at
6:30
in
the
morning.”
the
record
shows
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
as
i
read
this,
the
government
says
whether
or
not
it
would
constitute
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
the
information
given
by
hom
way
to
the
agent
was
entitled
to
be
given
considerable
weight.
it
had
sufficient
earmarks
of
credibility
indeed
to
require
investigation.
what
i
said
mr.
justice
goldberg
was
that
the
government
does
not
contend
that
this
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
arrest
and
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement.
they
do
not
contend
that
that
standing
alone
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
arrest.
they
say
that
something
else
provided
the
sine
qua
non
of
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
and
they
do
not
contend
or
i
think
they
could
not
contend
in
logic
and
reason
that
hom
way's
statements
standing
alone
was
sufficient.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
they
don't
stand
on
it.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
the
illegality
of
toy's
arrest.
and
i've
said
that
at
the
time
that
toy
opened
the
door,
they
didn't
know
he
was
the
‘blackie
toy'
referred
to
as
hom
way.
they
didn't
even
know
they
were
at
the
right
laundry.
they
didn't
ask
him,
they
attempted
to
perpetrate
the
ruse
on
him
and
this
was
a
man
about
whom
the
record
shows
he
had
little
fluency
in
the
english
language,
that
so
little
fluency
in
the
english
language
that
it
was
necessary
through
the
course
of
the
trial
to
have
an
interpreter
present.
he
had
so
little
fluency
in
the
english
language
that
it
was
necessary
for
a
chinese
agent
to
take
the
statement
and
to
advise
him
with
respect
to
its
meaning.
now,
it
was
this
man
first
of
all
who
was
made
the
object
of
a
ruse
by
an
agent
knocking
at
his
door
at
6:30
in
the
morning.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
agent
was
likewise
chinese,
yes
sir.
but
the
--
the
records,
mr.
justice
clark
indicates
the
conversation
at
the
door
was
a
conversation
in
english.
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
wong
was,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that
he
knew
the
man
that
he
was
talking
to
was
toy
and
he
didn't
ask
him.
he
simply
broke
in
the
door
and
went
through
when
the
door
was
slammed.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
day
or
the
week
is
not
shown
in
the
record.
it
was
june
4,
1959.
i
--
the
previous
june
2nd
was
identified
as
a
tuesday,
so
was
it
was
thursday
morning.
now,
i
think
it's
useful
to
look
at
the
record
and
see
the
state
of
mind
of
the
man
who
made
the
arrest
because
i
think
it's
readily
inferable
that
he
didn't
think
he
had
probable
cause
for
making
arrest
when
he
went
to
that
door
that
morning.
the
fact
is
he
testified
as
follows
at
page
53
of
the
record.
at
the
top
of
the
page
he
says
do
you
recall
--
he's
asked,
“do
you
recall
breaking
the
lock
or
breaking
the
door
in
anyways?”
he
says,
“i
didn't
break
the
lock.
”of
course,
that
has
rather
mendacious
characteristic,
i
think,
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
government
subsequently
stipulated
that
the
door
was
broken
opened
that
morning
and
that
appears
as
a
stipulation
footnoted
in
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
page
136.
then
he's
asked,
“you
chased
him
down
the
hallway
into
his
bedroom?”
“yes
sir.”
“put
handcuffs
on
him
and
placed
him
under
arrest,
is
that
right?”
“not
until
he
put
his
hand
into
the
nightstand
drawer.”
“then
you
put
the
handcuffs
on
him
and
placed
him
under
arrest
and
had
drawn
your
pistol
just
before
that,
is
that
right?”
“i
had
drawn
the
pistol
because
he
reached
into
the
drawer.
i
didn't
know
what
he
had
in
it.”
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
right.
but
i
--
but
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
undertake
i
think
it's
inferable
from
the
record
that
his
basis
for
arrest
in
his
mind
came
at
such
point
as
there
was
an
overture
made
to
the
nightstand
by
petitioner
toy.
now,
i
get
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i'm
sorry?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
he
went
after
him
then
but
he
doesn't
say
at
any
point
mr.
justice
clark
that
he
was
going
after
him
to
arrest
him
at
that
time.
in
fact,
when
he's
asked
about
the
arrest
he
says,
“yes,
i
arrested
him
when
he
reached
for
the
nightstand
drawer.”
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that
before
an
arrest
can
be
made
without
a
warrant
by
a
federal
agent
that
the
statement
given
by
the
informant
must
have
indicia
of
credibility
whether
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
agent
has
had
prior
experience
with
the
informant
or
whether
there
are
some
other
criteria
of
reliability.
in
the
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don't
think
it's
just
one
facet
but
there
is
no
facet
here
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
to
support
in
this
record
the
fact
that
the
informant
was
worthy
of
belief
in
this
frame
of
reference.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
all.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
from
blackie
toy
and
blackie
toy
--
and
no
place
in
this
record
is
equated
with
james
wah
toy,
no
place.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
the
appropriate
method
of
procedure
in
this
case
where
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
petitioner
toy
would
flee
where
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
there
would
be
suppression
of
evidence
because
way
was
arrested
at
2
a.m.
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
that
intelligence
had
been
communicated
to
toy.
the
proper
way
to
proceed
in
this
case
was
for
the
agents
to
have
taken
hom
way
before
a
commissioner
and
had
him
swear
to
a
complaint
on
the
basis
of
which
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
blackie
toy
could
have
issued.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that
if
there
was
a
statement
sworn
to
by
hom
way
that
that
would
be
a
probable
cause
for
issuing
a
warrant
against
blackie
toy
who
i
presumed
could
have
been
appropriately
described
by
hom
way.
i
think
it
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
oh,
i
think
that
adds
a
very
important
factor
to
what
is
--
is
here.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
in
this
--
in
this
case,
i
think
it
does,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
if
a
warrant
could
reasonably
have
been
issued
against
blackie
toy
described
by
hom
way,
i
do
not
suggest
for
a
moment
that
i'm
conceding
that
that
was
an
appropriate
warrant
for
the
man
who
is
subsequently
arrested
without
other
identifying
marks.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
what
i
think
--
what
i
think
mr.
justice
white
is
that
they
did
what
any
good
investigator
would
do.
they
investigated
every
chinese
laundry
in
leavenworth
street,
and
there
are
many.
and
they
ended
up
in
oye's
laundry
and
they
found
a
man
whose
name
is
toy
and
never
identified
as
blackie
toy
in
this
whole
record.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
alright,
i
don't
know
what
was
in
their
minds.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i'm
--
i
have
to
argue
this
case
from
the
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
way.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
6:30
a.m.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
5:30
to
6:30.
i
--
i
don't
know
how
many
laundries
they
went
through,
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record
but
they
certainly
--
the
records
supports
the
inference
that
they
were
engaged
in
a
systematic
investigation
of
the
laundries
because
the
record
is
very
clear
that
way
was
unable
to
say
where
on
leavenworth
street
the
laundry
was.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
6:30
a.m.
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
oh,
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
before
the
last
question,
that
under
the
miller
decision
this
court
in
1957,
this
court
applied
the
standards
that
set
out
in
3910
of
title
xviii
with
respect
to
the
right
of
breaking
to
serve
a
search
warrant.
it
applied
the
same
criteria
to
the
right
of
breaking
to
arrest
without
a
warrant.
and
it
said
that
it
is
necessary
first
of
all
to
state
the
authority
and
the
purpose
of
the
man
who
is
about
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
authority
was
stated
and
the
purpose
was
misstated.
it
was
not
only
not
stated,
it
was
deliberately
misstated
because
instead
of
advising
the
occupant
of
these
premises
that
they
were
--
that
he
was
a
narcotic
agent
there
to
investigate
a
charge.
he
said,
“i'd
come
for
my
--
to
get
my
laundry.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
he
did,
first
of
all,
he
said
i've
come
to
get
my
laundry.
toy
replied
the
laundry
opens
at
eight
o'clock
and
undertook
to
close
the
door
and
he
showed
his
badge
of
authority
and
said,
“i
am
a
narcotics
agent.”
toy
slammed
the
door,
hurried
through
the
laundry.
no
statement
was
ever
made
with
respect
to
his
purpose.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
had
a
clear
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
had
a
clear
opportunity
to
say
why
he
was
there,
when
he
aroused
the
occupant
by
knocking
at
the
door
and
ringing
the
bell
at
6:30
in
the
morning.
he
had
a
chance
to
say,
“i'm
a
narcotics
agent,
here
to
investigate
an
accusation
or
some
information
that
we
have.”
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
the
door
was
opened.
he
had
a
chance
to
say
it
when
the
door
was
opened,
instead
of
perpetrating
of
a
ruse
on
the
occupant
at
6:30
in
the
morning
if
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
he
had
a
chance
to
communicate
readily
with
the
occupant
of
the
premises.
now,
the
government
with
respect
to
wong
sun's
arrest
makes
this
argument.
insofar
as
the
record
shows
johnny
yee
was
likewise
wholly
untested
informant.
he
made
a
statement
with
respect
to
sea
dog
subsequently
an
investigation
revealed
that
sea
dog
is
wong
sun
and
the
arrest
was
made
and
the
government
says
we
had
two
witnesses
with
respect
to
wong
sun.
we
had
johnny
yee
and
we
had
petitioner
james
wah
toy.
well,
of
course
i
think
the
suspicious
--
the
suspiciousness
of
this
argument
can
be
demonstrated
from
a
simple
analogy.
it's
as
though
the
government
has
one
witness
who
says
a
equals
b,
and
they
have
another
witness
who
says
b
equals
c,
and
they
contend
that
they
have
two
witnesses
who
say
that
a
equals
c.
no
warrant
was
obtained
here.
there
was
certainly
no
lack
of
opportunity
to
obtain
a
warrant
at
10:30
in
the
morning.
his
premises
were
invaded,
he
was
placed
under
arrest
and
he
was
taken
off
in
what
we
contend
was
unequally
illegal
arrest.
now,
what
are
the
consequences
that
flow
from
this?
this
court
has
held
time
and
again
that
a
non-lawful
arrest
effected
by
federal
law
enforcement
officer
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
a
violation
of
the
right
of
the
citizen
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
seizures
of
this
person,
it
held
us
in
the
line
of
cases
most
illustrative
of
which
were
the
giordenello
and
the
henry
cases.
again,
this
court
for
almost
a
half
a
century
has
attached
an
evidentiary
consequence
to
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
beginning
in
the
weeks
case
that
held
that
any
physical
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
should
be
excluded.
now,
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
has
for
its
purpose
the
deterrence
of
the
lawless
law
enforcement.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
so
long
as
any
derivative
benefits
or
fruits
are
allowed
to
law
enforcement
officers
for
lawless
conduct,
that
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
cannot
be
expected
to
work
because
there
will
be
no
--
there
will
be
no
reason
for
compliance
because
no
other
sanctions
are
ever
imposed
with
respect
to
violations
of
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
citizens.
and
i
suggest
that
if
in
fact
the
federal
police
as
a
result
of
an
illegal
arrest
may
get
threshold
statements
from
the
accused
which
can
be
admissible
in
the
federal
proceeding,
later
on
a
criminal
proceeding,
there'll
be
no
reason
not
to
continue
unlawful
arrest.
the
court
has
been
consistent
in
striking
down
physical
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
it
has
been
consistent
in
striking
down
visual
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
last
year
in
silverman
against
the
united
states,
this
court
struck
down
audible
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
and
it
was
following
what
i
contend
was
an
unbroken
chain
of
federal
jurisprudence
on
this
subject
because
in
1940
when
this
question
first
arose
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
judge
vinson
and
chief
judge
groner
and
judge
edgerton
unanimously
agreed
in
nueslein
against
the
united
states
at
115
f.2d,
that
where
a
police
made
an
illegal
entry
on
the
premises
and
interrogated
the
accused
and
got
an
incriminatory
admission
from
him
on
his
own
premises
that
that
statement
could
not
go
into
evidence
in
the
subsequent
criminal
prosecution.
prior
to
that
time
in
a
decision
by
judge
learned
hand
speaking
for
the
second
circuit
in
somers
against
the
united
states,
we
had
an
almost
identical
factual
situation.
agents
of
the
alcohol
tax
unit
entered
the
apartment
of
somers.
he
was
not
there.
the
entry
was
illegal.
they
interrogated
his
wife
as
a
result
of
that
interrogation,
they
found
somers'
whereabouts
where
he
would
be
in
20
minutes,
they
went
--
they
found
him
with
alcohol,
they
arrested
him.
second
circuit
speaking
through
judge
hand
found
that
statement
to
have
been
inadmissible
because
made
as
the
result
of
an
illegal
arrest
and
struck
down
the
subsequent
evidence
as
being
fruit
from
the
poisonous
tree.
now,
how
does
the
government
respond
to
this
line
of
cases?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
government
contends
that
the
chain
of
causality
becomes
so
attenuated
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
statement
of
toy
made
on
his
premises
on
the
threshold
of
his
arrest
was
a
voluntary
statement,
that
it
becomes
admissible
notwithstanding
the
decisions
in
this
line
of
somers.
now,
i
think
we
have
to
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well
whatever
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
makes
no
difference
so
long
as
the
statement,
which
the
government
seeks
to
offer
at
a
subsequent
time
in
a
criminal
prosecution
is
incriminatory
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
in
the
admission.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
may
take
it
out
of
the
case,
yes
sir.
in
this
instance,
may
i
say
to
you
in
response
to
your
direct
question,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
this
court
as
you
will
know
has
held
in
the
mallory,
mcnabb,
upshaw
line
of
cases.
that
where
a
statement
is
made
during
a
period
of
illegal
detention
and
that
case
as
a
result
of
a
violation
of
rule
5
prolonged
detention
without
taking
the
accused
before
a
magistrate.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
statement
might
be
voluntary
or
involuntary,
it
struck
down,
why,
because
there
has
been
a
violation
of
a
statutory
right
of
an
accused.
now,
i
think
consistency
demands
that
where
you
have
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
namely
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
you
had
illegal
detention
ab
initio
because
the
very
fact
of
the
arrest
shows
that
the
detention
from
the
beginning
was
unlawful
that
a
statement
made
during
that
unlawful
detention
should
be
struck
down
as
being
inadmissible
especially
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
this
particular
statement
was
made
right
on
the
threshold
of
the
arrest
when
the
coercive
influences
of
an
unlawful
arrest
certainly
cannot
be
regarded
as
having
been
broken
and
there
was
no
demonstration
by
the
government
or
attempt
to
demonstrate
by
the
government
that
the
coercive
influence
of
an
unlawful
arrest
consummated
at
6:30
a.m.
in
the
morning
at
pistol
point
with
handcuffs
in
the
bedroom
of
a
man
where
his
wife
and
child
were
present
did
not
have
a
coercive
influence
on
his
statement
or
his
subsequent
expression.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
dealing
here
with
a
constitutional
right
which
makes
the
argument
even
stronger
than
the
argument
that
was
advanced
and
sustained
by
this
court
in
mallory,
upshaw
and
mcnabb.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
designed,
i
think,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
be
exculpatory.
as
it
turned
out
it
is
the
major
piece
of
evidence
upon
which
the
government
relies
to
support
the
conviction
in
this
case
so
that
i
have
to
say
that
it's
taken
on
the
characteristic
in
the
government's
mind
as
being
a
very
inculpatory
statement.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that's
true.
but
the
--
but
the
fact
is
that
the
statement
which
was
made
was
a
statement
to
this
effect.
number
one,
johnny
has
narcotics.
i
saw
them
there
last
night.
and
johnny
lives
and
the
designation
was
made
as
to
the
place
of
his
residence.
so
that
regardless
of
what
the
intent
of
the
speaker
may
have
been
it
was
an
incriminatory
statement
and
so
used
by
the
government
in
the
subsequent
proceeding.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
used
--
they
offered
this
as
evidence
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it's
why
i'd
say
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
might
very
well
be
incriminatory
and
that
it
did
as
it
did
in
this
case
lead
to
a
chain
of
evidence
which
produced
his
indictment
and
subsequently
his
conviction.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
an
evidence
in
the
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that
statement?
no
sir.
no
sir
because
it
was
not
throughout
under
your
hypothetical
question.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
sir.
the
language
which
authorizes
their
arrest
statutorily
recites
that
they
have
a
basis
for
arresting
without
a
warrant
when
they
have
as
i
recall
the
statutory
--
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
a
felony
has
been
committed
and
that
the
arrested
party
has
committed
a
felony.
it's
language
that
differs
from
the
constitutional
language
of
probable
cause,
reasonable
grounds
but
i
think
it's
been
equated
with
the
--
with
probable
cause.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
a
private
car.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
all
he
said
at
the
time
of
the
illegal
entry
into
his
premises
is
that
he
was
driving
the
cab.
he
didn't
concede
anything
with
respect
to
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
give
him
a
test
subsequently
back
at
the
station.
but
he
didn't
make
any
concession
with
respect
to
alcohol.
now,
i
don't
contend
that
the
mere
fact
of
an
unlawful
arrest
makes
everything
that
flows
from
it,
thereafter
--
all
evidence
unearth,
thereafter
inadmissible.
what
we
say
is
that
where
there
is
an
unlawful
arrest,
the
burden
shifts
to
the
government
to
show
that
the
chain
of
causality
was
broken
and
it
can
be
broken
on
a
number
of
ways
as
i
would
see
it
by
release,
by
conference
with
counsel,
by
arraignment.
but
there
was
no
showing
in
this
record
that
there
was
ever
a
release
or
conference
with
counsel
or
that
there
was
an
arraignment
except
insofar
as
it
was
unearth
at
the
last
argument.
and
that
the
last
argument
of
this
case,
we
presented
these
documents
which
purport
to
show
an
arraignment
but
there's
no
showing
here
that
there
was
any
proper
arraignment
because
there's
no
showing
that
there
was
an
interpreter
present,
as
was
necessary
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
so
that
there
was
some
communication
to
this
man
of
their
rights
which
is
the
sole
purpose
of
the
arraignment.
and
of
course
there
is
no
showing
that
there
was
counsel
present
and
most
significant
with
respect
to
these
documents,
there
is
a
showing
on
the
face
of
the
documents
that
after
the
petitioners
were
taken
to
narcotics
headquarters,
and
before
a
commissioner,
then
a
warrant
for
their
arrest
was
issued
which
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
most
unorthodox
and
unusual
if
the
arrest
had
been
consummated
lawfully
in
the
first
instance.
there
was
no
need
to
go
through
a
meaningless
act
back
at
the
commissioner's
office
of
issuing
a
warrant
for
their
arrest
on
the
statement
of
federal
narcotics
agents.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
no
sir.
i
don't
--
i
think
in
the
first
instance
where
you
have
an
arrest
and
the
defendant
comes
forward
and
challenges
the
validity
of
the
arrest,
of
course
it's
necessary
for
him
to
produce
evidence
to
show
that
the
arrest
was
then
invalid.
that
was
done
here
and
it
was
done
at
the
trial.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
was
then
illegal
in
the
first
instance.
the
burden
still
remains,
of
course,
i
think
if
we're
talking
about
the
burden
of
proof
as
distinguished
from
the
burden
of
proceeding
with
the
evidence
on
the
government
to
validate
the
arrest.
but
now,
in
this
instance,
there
was
a
showing
of
the
illegality
of
arrest.
now,
the
government
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
believe
that
the
evidence
showed
that
the
arrest
was
illegal,
mr.
justice
black.
i
believe
that
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
proper
that
the
arrest
to
both
wong
sun
and
james
wah
toy
were
illegal.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
if
you
start
off
with
the
premise,
mr.
justice
black,
that
you
have
an
unlawful
arrest
that
any
statements
made
by
the
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
the
arrest
was
lawful,
then
the
evidence
would
be
admissible.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
unless
we
get
into
this
problem
of
statements
made
vis-à-vis
the
arraignment
and
the
time
of
arraignment,
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
if
this
court
finds
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
that
the
arrest
were
lawfully
made
of
wong
sun
and
toy,
then
certainly
i
could
not
contend
in
logic
that
the
statement
made
by
toy
in
his
premises
and
the
subsequent
follow-up
investigation
which
produce
the
narcotics
at
yee's
would
be
inadmissible.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
i
haven't
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
withhold
--
if
all
the
evidence
were
admissible,
that
argument
still
obtains,
yes
sir,
and
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
in
the
last
few
moments
i
have.
but
the
point
that
i
have
tried
to
make
here
is
that
we
aren't
contending
that
the
mere
unlawfulness
of
the
arrest
thereby
makes
all
the
evidence
produced
by
the
defendant
thereafter
for
all
times
sacrosanct
and
inadmissible
because
that
chain
of
illegal
activity
can
be
broken
by
as
released
by
his
arraignment
or
by
conference
with
counsel.
now,
with
respect
to
the
statements
that
were
offered,
it's
been
axiomatic
in
our
jurisprudence
that
an
uncorroborated
confession
cannot
support
a
conviction.
likewise,
axiomatic
that
in
any
criminal
case
all
of
the
elements
that
the
offense
must
be
proven
and
they
must
be
proven
by
extrinsic
evidence
of
by
corroborated
admissions.
now,
in
this
particular
case
assuming
arguendo
that
all
of
the
evidence
was
admissible,
there
is
still
no
corroboration
in
this
case
of
possession
by
either
wong
sun
or
by
petitioner
wah
toy
apart
from
their
own
statements
in
the
matter.
now,
possession
becomes
the
heart
of
this
case
because
it
is
on
de
facto
position
that
the
statute
creates
a
presumption
and
possessions
unexplained
that
there
was
transportation,
sale,
concealment
and
purchase
and
if
there
is
no
possession,
there
is
no
basis
for
inference
or
presumption
that
any
of
these
elements
of
the
offense
were
present.
now,
with
respect
to
petitioner
toy,
there
is
not
only
no
independent
evidence
of
the
fact
that
he
ever
possessed
a
narcotic.
in
fact,
the
confession
doesn't
concede
possession
of
a
narcotic.
the
confession
simply
concedes
a
transportation
of
wong
sun
to
the
home
of
johnny
yee.
in
the
case
of
wong
sun,
there
is
no
independent
evidence
in
this
whole
record
to
support
an
admission
of
possession
of
narcotics.
the
possession
was
found
in
johnny
yee,
the
presumption
that
is
created
by
statute
authorizing
the
inference
of
the
other
elements
of
the
offense,
works
against
johnny
yee
certainly
but
there
cannot
be
such
an
inference
or
a
presumption
made
against
either
petitioner
james
wah
toy
or
petitioner
wong
sun
because
there
is
no
evidence
apart
from
their
own
statements
in
the
manner
that
they
ever
possessed
and
accordingly,
that
they
ever
transported,
that
they
ever
concealed,
that
they
ever
sold,
that
they
ever
purchased,
and
a
fortiori
that
they
had
any
knowledge
of
illegal
importation
of
the
heroin
in
question.
and
so
apart
from
the
fourth
amendment
question,
on
the
illegality
of
the
arrest,
apart
from
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
of
question,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
these
convictions
must
fall
because
of
the
failure
of
the
government's
proof
to
support
the
admissions
with
sufficient
extrinsic
evidence
aliunde
confessions
in
the
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
the
court
please.
i
don't
like
to
get
into
an
argument
that
the
government
held
so
with
respect
to
what
the
record
says
but
i
fear
that
it
is
necessary
here
because
i'm
afraid
that
an
erroneous
impression
has
been
left
with
respect
to
the
state
of
the
record
as
a
result
of
some
questions
that
have
been
propounded.
i
believe
that
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan
who
this
morning
asked
the
question
whether
or
not
alton
wong
said
through
a
close
door
i've
come
here
for
my
laundry
or
whether
the
door
was
open
at
that
time.
and
i
understood
government
counsel
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
perpetrate
this
ruse
on
mr.
toy
in
order
to
get
him
to
open
the
door.
well,
the
record
is
to
the
contrary
on
that,
the
record
at
page
38
is
as
follows:
“mr.
toy,
the
first
time
you
saw
the
chinese
narcotics
agent
was
in
the
morning
when
he
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
laundry,
is
that
right?”
“he
rang
the
bell.”
“oh!
he
rang
the
bell
then
you
opened
the
door?”
“yes.”
question:
“and
then
the
agent
showed
you
a
badge,
didn't
he?”
“no,
he
just
asked
for
the
laundry.”
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
page
38
of
the
record
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
bottom.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
so
that
i
think
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
the
door
had
been
opened
by
the
occupant
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
attempt
any
ruse
on
him
in
order
to
get
him
to
open
the
door.
now
secondly,
the
question
has
been
raised
with
respect
to
petitioner
toy's
fluency
with
the
english
language.
and
the
suggestion
was
made
to
the
court
that
the
necessity
for
an
interpreter
arose
not
because
of
toy's
lack
of
fluency
with
the
english
language
but
because
of
sun's
lack
of
familiarity
with
the
language.
i
think
that
the
record
as
to
the
contrary.
at
page
39,
when
toy
was
on
the
witness
stand
testifying,
the
following
colloquy
took
place
and
i
quote
from
the
top
of
page
39,
mr.
abrams
who
was
the
trial
counsel
for
the
defense
in
this
case
outside,
“alright,
may
i
ask
that
the
interpreter
make
that
clear
to
the
witness
where
this
conversation
had
taken
place?”
government
counsel,
mr.
rearton
(ph),
“he
is
answering
in
english.”
the
court:
“yes,
he
is
answering
in
english
and
as
i
understand
it
he
and
the
interpreter
are
discussing
these
things
together.”
in
addition
to
this
record
reference
at
pages
11,
16,
68,
and
72,
there
is
further
demonstration
of
the
need
for
an
interpreter
during
the
course
of
the
trial
for
both
of
the
petitioners.
again,
in
response
to
a
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
brennan
also
this
morning
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
anything
incriminating
in
the
threshold
statement
made
by
toy
immediately
on
his
arrest.
i
responded
that
he
had
admitted
his
presence
in
yee's
premises
the
night
before.
then
during
interrogation
of
government
counsel,
it
was
suggested
that
the
only
supporting
record
reference
for
that
was
a
statement
by
the
district
attorney
who
of
course
was
not
qualified
to
testify
with
respect
to
the
facts.
but
at
page
63
of
the
record,
agent
nicolov
is
testifying
to
the
statement
made
by
petitioner
toy
immediately
upon
his
arrest
in
his
bedroom
on
the
morning
of
june
4th.
and
what
does
he
say?
and
i'm
reading
from
almost
the
center
of
the
page
at
page
63.
he
said
it
was
--
he
described
the
house
to
us,
it
was
a
remodeled
front
of
the
house
with
a
white
trim,
sort
of
beige
color
and
he
said
he
had
been
there
the
night
before.
and
we
asked
him
how
much
stuff,
i
asked
him
how
much
stuff
johnny
had.
and
he
said
he
had
about
a
piece
and
that
johnny
had
a
bedroom
here,
it
was
his
folk's
house
and
the
bedroom
was
upstairs.
so
the
record
does
show
that
petitioner
toy
on
the
very
threshold
of
his
rest
--
arrest
admitted
his
presence
in
yee's
premises
the
night
before.
now,
counsel
said
that
at
pages
42
and
43
of
the
government's
brief,
there
is
cited
a
line
of
authority
to
verge
in
from
that
to
which
i
call
the
court's
attention
suggesting
that
evidence
oral
in
nature
on
the
threshold
of
an
illegal
arrest
is
admissible
or
has
been
held
admissible
by
the
federal
court.
i
respectfully
disagree
with
counsel.
he
cites
three
cases
there.
he
cites
the
case
of
smith
against
the
united
states,
united
states
against
walker,
and
gibson
against
the
united
states.
in
smith
against
the
united
states,
the
court
used
this
specific
language,
it
said
the
difference
between
the
facts
in
the
nueslein
case
and
the
instant
cases
are
apparent.
in
nueslein
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
arrest
of
nueslein
up
to
the
time
the
search
was
made.
here,
probable
cause
existed
to
believe
a
felony
had
been
committed
and
that
smith
had
committed
it.
so
the
court
of
appeals
validated
that
arrest
and
that's
why
the
statement
was
allowed
in
evidence.
again,
in
united
states
against
walker,
likewise
cited
by
the
government
in
supporting
its
theory
on
the
federal
exclusionary
rule,
the
court
specifically
said
this,
and
i
quote,
“in
our
opinion
appellant
has
not
established
his
arrest
was
illegal.”
so
that
neither
of
these
case
support
what
the
government
contends
for
in
this
instance.
now
they
cite
a
file
case,
gibson
against
the
united
states,
a
district
of
columbia
case.
in
that
case,
there
was
an
illegal
arrest.
there
was
a
threshold
admission,
incriminatory
in
nature.
that
admission
was
allowed
in
evidence
by
the
trial
court
but
the
fact
was
that
after
the
threshold
admission
o'kelly,
the
appellant
was
released.
he
returned
the
next
day
and
repeated
the
incriminatory
statement
voluntarily,
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
see
the
prejudicial
error
in
allowing
in
the
first
instance.
but
for
whatever
that
case
may
hold
that
gives
consolation
to
the
government,
on
thursday
last,
the
court
of
appeals
emasculated
this
decision
in
killough
against
the
united
states
by
holding
that
an
immediately
subsequent
confession
after
a
violation
of
rule
5,
a
subsequent
confession
made
not
during
the
period
of
illegal
detention,
must
be
regarded
as
fruit
of
the
poison
tree
and
they
struck
it
down
on
thursday,
october
4,
1962.
finally
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
yes
your
honor.
finally,
it
was
suggested
to
the
court
that
there
was
corroboration
of
the
so-called
confession
and
when
counsel
was
put
to
developing
the
corroboration,
he
cited
a
statement
that
toy
had
made
immediately
after
his
arrest.
but
i
think
as
i
think
it's
axiomatic
that
you
cannot
corroborate
an
admission
with
another
admission.
the
corroboration
must
be
with
evidence,
extrinsic
in
nature.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
the
statement
said
about
a
piece.
now,
the
fact
is
i
believe
that
it
was
27
grams,
which
was
found
in
yee's
house.
but
there
is
no
possession.
there
is
no
evidence
of
possession
on
the
part
of
wong
sun
or
on
the
part
of
toy
aliunde
the
so-called
confessions.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that
they
ever
possessed.
now,
possession
is
not
the
offense
here,
if
the
court
please.
possession
is
merely
a
basis
for
presumption
of
the
other
elements
of
the
offense.
in
order
for
that
presumption
to
operate
and
make
a
prima
facie
case
--
of
a
violation
of
the
statute,
it's
necessary
that
the
possession
be
shown
in
the
defendant.
but
there
isn't
any
possession
shown
by
any
statement
of
wah
toy
nor
is
there
any
possession
shown
by
evidence
apart
from
his
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
statement
because
the
possession
was
in
yee.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
statement
of
wah
toy
was
that
the
last
piece
had
been
delivered
to
johnny
yee
on
last
tuesday,
may
26.
but
the
significant
thing,
mr.
justice
brennan
is
that
this
statement
was
either
made
on
june
5
or
june
9,
and
last
tuesday,
it
would
have
had
to
be
june
2.
so
that
there's
no
correlation
between
the
allegation
charging
a
substantive
violation
of
the
statute
purportedly
on
june
1,
with
the
date
to
which
he
referred,
may
26.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that
they
had
to
prove
this
case
the
way
that
the
prosecutor
conceive
that
he
had
to
prove
this
case
when
he
began
the
trial.
he
needed
johnny
yee's
testimony.
he
didn't
get
it.
and
not
only
he
didn't
get
his
testimony,
he
got
a
complete
repudiation
of
the
statement
that
was
allegedly
given
by
yee
to
narcotics
agents.
and
i
think
that
when
that
testimony,
that
viva
voce
of
testimony
went
out
that
they
didn't
have
sufficient
corroboration
within
the
purview
of
the
smith
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think,
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
at
10:30
that
morning
when
the
government
could
readily
have
gone
to
a
commissioner,
they
had
gone
and
they
had
taken
a
sworn
statement
from
johnny
yee
saying
that
the
narcotic
which
i
had
in
my
possession
last
night
and
the
narcotic
which
is
now
in
the
possession
of
the
government,
i
took
from
johnny
yee,
from
--
i'm
sorry,
from
wong
sun.
in
fact,
he
said
from
sea
dog,
and
if
they
had
supporting
affidavits
to
equate
sea
dog
with
wong
sun,
then
i
think
that
a
commissioner
sitting
as
a
quasi-judicial
officer
with
the
opportunity
to
evaluate
the
credibility
of
that
evidence
could
have
issued
a
valid
arrest
warrant
for
wong
sun
but
they
didn't
do
that.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
that's
the
way
rule
4
provides
it.
it'd
be
done,
but
it
does
give
the
commissioner
an
opportunity
to
test
the
credibility
of
the
affiant
interrogation.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
thank
you
sir.
