was
daylight,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
williams,
i
think
the
chronology
there,
in
my
point
of
view
if
you
please,
there
might
be
of
some
importance.
you
said
that
he
undertook
to
close
the
door?
justice
potter
stewart
before
agent
wong
told
him
he
was
a
federal
narcotics
agent?
justice
potter
stewart
when
does
the
--
can
you
refer
us
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
was
the
substantive
count
again?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
then,
this
was
concealment
of
or
some
connection
with
the
concealment
of
the
heroin
taken
from
johnny
yee?
that's
the
only
narcotics
as
i
understand
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
so
its
relation
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
which
proceeds
from
johnny
yee?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
convicted
then
of
what?
concealment
or
otherwise,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
toy?
justice
potter
stewart
let
see
if
i
get
this.
this
is
based
on
the
fact
that
he
shut
the
door
in
agent
wong's
faces
and
ran
back
to
the
living
quarters?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
doesn't
--
excuse
me.
i
didn't
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
have
interrupted
you.
but
doesn't
the
argue
--
that
the
government's
arguments
depend
upon
its
reading
the
evidence
as
showing
that
he
didn't
run
until
the
agent
identified
himself
as
an
agent
that
so
long
as
they
were
just
talking
about
when
the
laundry
was
going
to
open,
he
stood
there
first
and
perhaps
not
very
happily
because
he'd
been
waken
up
but
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
it
didn't
happen
until
he
had
identified
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
himself
as
an
agent?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
said,
“i
was
only
using
the
force
necessary
to
open
the
door.”
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
see
how
this
verbal
evidence
was
secured
as
the
result
of
unlawful
arrest
if
this
was
verbal
evidence
which
was
volunteered.
justice
potter
stewart
it
didn't
result
from
the
legality
of
the
arrest,
that's
the
part
i
--
that's
the
step
i
can't
seem
to
take
into
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
mallory
--
justice
potter
stewart
mallory-mcnabb
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
made
during
any
period
of
guilty
plea.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
you
leave
that
first
case
mr.
williams,
as
you
explain
it
to
us,
it
strikes
me
that
that
case
involved
these
overtones
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
well
as
the
fourth
amendment
which
makes
it,
in
some
ways
unlike
the
case
now
before
us,
doesn't
it,
where
here,
we're
not
talking
about
self-incriminatory
statements
so
much
as
statements
by
one
person
allegedly
wrongly
arrested
which
incriminated
another
person?
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
say
they
did
arraign,
do
you
mean
they
--
they
appear
before
united
states
commissioner?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
happened
there?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
let
him
to
go
to
that
laundry.
justice
potter
stewart
but
certainly
--
justice
potter
stewart
daylight,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
were
the
circumstances
under
which
the
home
of
wong
sun
was
entered?
they
didn't
break
in
there,
did
they?
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
--
this
was
not
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
--
just
a
few
minutes
earlier
and
testified
that
he
assumed
and
thought
that
what
he
was
reaching
for
was
a
gun
in
that
night
table?
justice
potter
stewart
now
doesn't
--
i
think
you've
said
it
but
you
haven't
emphasize
it.
the
admission
or
confession
has
to
be
the
result
of
the
illegality
of
the
arrest,
does
it
not,
under
those
cases?
and
nueslein
case
was
a
drunk
and
driving
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
there
have
to
be
a
showing
that
the
--
that
the
confession
or
the
admission
was
--
resulted
from
the
illegality
of
the
--
of
the
personal
seizure
or
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
--
implication
of
somebody
else
that
if
we
say,
“well,
i
haven't
got
any,
but
john
smith
has
it.”
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
a
confession,
that's
not
an
admission.
justice
potter
stewart
it
certainly
makes
a
difference
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
under
the
self-incrimination
insofar
as
the
fifth
amendment
is
applicable
and
i'm
--
i
have
in
mind
that
mr.
justice
black's
concurring
opinion
in
mapp,
for
example
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
insofar
as
what
the
statement
does
is
to
implicate
somebody
else
that
takes
the
fifth
amendment
out
of
the
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
the
equating
blackie
toy
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
wah
toy?
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that's
the
deficiency
to
which
you
refer?
justice
potter
stewart
the
district
court
didn't
make
any
clear
ruling
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
simply
not
clear.
