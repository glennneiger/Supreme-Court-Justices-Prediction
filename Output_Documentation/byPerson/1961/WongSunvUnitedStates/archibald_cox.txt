mr.
archibald
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
at
first
blush,
this
case
is
undoubtedly
a
troublesome
and
indeed,
for
me,
it
was
a
wearisome
case.
the
government
is
not
less
concerned
in
the
court
i
think
with
accusations
that
federal
agents
in
making
arrest
and
searches
have
acted
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
--
or
the
kind
of
first
general
impression
one
gets
upon
looking
at
this
back
quickly
certainly
lay
some
basis
for
thinking
that
perhaps
that
occur
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
meant
the
fourth,
yes.
upon
examining
the
exact
issues
and
upon
looking
at
exactly
what
happened
here
with
care
and
precision
and
particularly
upon
looking
at
the
facts
as
they
appeared
to
the
arresting
officers
at
the
critical
point
in
times,
then
i
think
the
court
will
get
as
i
did,
a
conviction
that
there
was
no
violation
of
law,
despite
the
superficial
appearances,
that
the
agents
acted
with
propriety
and
that
there
was
no
error
in
the
court
below.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
court
--
there
was
no
--
that
there
was
no
error
in
the
trial
court's
finding
that
the
arrest
was
lawful
and
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
now,
the
trial
court
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
found
that
the
--
to
the
trial
court
didn't
find
that
the
arrests
were
illegal.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
think
that
it
erred
in
that
--
in
that
statement.
no
error
in
the
judgment
below
it.
now,
one
can
get
at
the
probably
most
accurately
here,
by
looking
at
the
objections
that
were
raised
at
trial.
petitioner's
principal
objection
was
to
the
admission
of
evidence.
they
asked
the
district
court
to
exclude
three
things.
first,
their
confessions
which
were
given
voluntarily
at
the
police
station,
four
or
five
days
after
the
arrest
and
after
they
had
been
released
on
their
own
recognizance.
there
was
no
bail
there
when
they
were
released
upon
arraignment.
second,
they
seek
to
have
excluded
this
ounce
of
heroin
have
found
not
at
the
premises
of
wah
toy
but
a
lot
--
quite
long
distance
way
in
the
city
of
san
francisco
sometime
later.
there
was
nothing
illegally
seized
at
wah
toy's
premises.
and
third,
they
seek
to
have
excluded
the
directions
given
by
wah
toy
as
to
where
the
agents
would
find
this
heroin.
the
argument
of
course
is
that
the
arrestment
of
wah
toy
was
unlawful,
that
the
illegality
of
his
arrest
by
the
agents
from
following
that
lead
to
get
the
narcotics,
that
the
narcotics
therefore
should
be
excluded
from
evidence.
and
even
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
they
say
that
since
the
defendants
confess
four
days
later,
those
voluntary
confessions
after
arraignment
and
release
should
also
be
excluded
under
the
logical
conclusion
their
argument.
now,
manifestly
the
whole
house
of
cards
collapses
if
this,
we
submit
to
be
the
case,
the
original
rest
--
arrest
was
lawful.
in
this
respect,
we
think
the
district
court
was
correct.
the
facts
clearly
must
be
taken
as
the
district
court
presumably
found
them
and
we
think
that
the
court
below
erred.
this
question
involves
no
legal
issue
that
is
in
any
way
debated.
what
it
caused
for
is
a
simple
matter
of
fact
appraisal
of
the
circumstances
that
confronted
agent
wong
at
the
time
that
he
went
into
the
house.
and
we
think
and
i
shall
argue
them
in
some
detail,
that
those
circumstances
constituted
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
the
--
well,
it's
a
legal
conclusion.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
--
i
was
really
attempting
to
contrast
this
question
with
what
i
take
to
be
the
second
issue
in
the
case
where
there
is
a
noble
point
of
law.
and
the
all
i
was
really
trying
to
is
to
contrast
the
two
in
that
respect.
our
second
position
is
that
the
evidence
was
properly
admitted
even
if
the
arrest,
contrary
to
what
i
believe,
was
unlawful.
and
petitioner,
of
course,
to
get
a
reversal
must
--
must
persuade
the
court
on
both
points.
if
we
prevail
on
either,
then
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
at
the
conclusion
of
my
argument,
i
direct
myself
very
briefly
to
this
question
about
whether
the
confessions
were
properly
corroborated.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
brinegar
case,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
possibility,
that's
in
that
category.
but
i
don't
--
except
for
that
case,
i
don't
recall
any
with
assurance
where
the
--
before
the
court
charged
with
finding
what
happened
had
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
then
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
in
finding
the
ultimate
fact,
they're
applying
for
general
standard
to
facts.
this
court
was
asked
to
revert
it.
brinegar,
i
think,
had
an
off
head
guess
involved
at.
my
first
point
then
as
i
said,
is
that
the
arrest,
although
without
warrant,
were
lawful
because
based
upon
probable
cause.
the
legal
standard
for
determining
the
legality
of
an
arrest
without
warrant
is
well-settled.
the
criminal
codes
specifically
give
narcotic
agents
the
authority
to
make
arrest
without
warrant
for
violations
of
any
law
of
the
united
states
relating
to
narcotic
drugs,
where
the
person
making
the
arrest
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
person's
to
be
arrested
--
person
to
be
arrested
has
committed
or
is
committing
such
violation.
the
reasonable
grounds
required
by
the
statute
are
equivalent,
the
court
has
said
to
the
probable
cause
required
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
probable
cause
is
reasonable
ground
for
belief
of
guilt.
it
certainly
something
less
than
evidence
that
would
justify
a
conviction,
it's
evidence
that
permits
of
some
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
arresting
officer,
provided
that
the
mistake
was
a
reasonable
one
made
by
a
man
acting
on
facts
leading
sensibly
to
the
conclusions
of
probability,
to
quote
from
this
court's
opinion
in
the
draper
case.
so
the
issue
here
is
whether
at
the
time
agent
wong
went
into
the
house,
he
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
wah
toy
had
committed
or
was
committing
the
crime
of
concealing
unlawfully
imparted
narcotics.
and
i
would
like
to
take
the
court
first
through
the
facts
with
respect
to
wah
toy's
arrest
and
then
with
the
facts
with
respect
to
wong
sun's
arrest
which
i
think
will
show
as
i've
said
that
the
agent
had
ground
for
this
reasonable
belief.
let's
take
wah
toy
first.
the
agent
had
first
information
given
him
by
hom
way
would
certainly
seems
to
us
to
have
justified
questioning
toy.
and
while
perhaps
not
probable
cause
by
itself,
appointed
suspicion
and
was
a
fact
that
the
agent
would
properly
keep
in
his
mind
as
he
proceeded
with
his
duties.
hom
way,
the
informer
was
believed
by
the
agent
to
be
reliable.
he
testified
to
that
both
on
direct
and
cross-examination,
and
he
had
known
him
for
six
weeks.
there's
not
the
slightest
hint
contrary
to
mr.
williams'
suggestion,
that
there
was
any
protracted
interrogation
of
hom
way.
we
do
know
there
was
a
period
of
time
between
his
arrest
and
the
time
when
he
gave
the
information,
but
we
don't
know
anything
about
what
happened
to
him.
that
hom
way's
statement
was
hearsay
and
would
not
be
admissible
in
evidence,
of
course
does
not
derogate
from
the
fact
that
it
would
be
one
circumstance
supporting
probable
cause
as
this
court
held
in
the
draper
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
couldn't
say
whether
it
is
the
usual
practice.
i
know
it
very
commonly
occur.
i
know
too,
that
the
--
there
is
great
pressure
in
narcotics
cases
to
act
quickly
but
there's
no
narcotic
is
so
easily
disposed
of.
i
think
that's
one
of
the
important
factors
here.
but
in
terms
of
any
statistical
rule
one
way
or
another,
i
couldn't
say
justice
harlan.
this
evidence,
i
think
that
is
the
evidence
that
they
had
information
from
hom
way
certainly
shows
that
the
evidence
acted
properly
in
going
to
blackie
toy
to
question
him.
mr.
archibald
cox
hom
way
simply
said
that
there
was
laundry
on
leavenworth
street.
the
agents
then
went
to
oye's
laundry
at
733
leavenworth
street.
mr.
archibald
cox
oye's
laundry.
o-y-e'
-
s.
the
agent
did
testify
that
hom
way
did
not
give
an
exact
address.
and
that
is
all
we
know
because
no
argument
was
made
in
the
district
court
where
the
evidence
could
have
been
developed
to
suggest
that
there
was
any
doubt
as
to
whether
james
wah
toy
was
blackie
toy
or
whether
the
agents
had
proper
reason
to
go
to
oye's
laundry.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
fact
that
they
went
to
oye's
laundry
was
the
best
proof
in
the
world
that
they
knew
either
from
the
general
description
of
--
although
not
an
exact
address
or
perhaps
because
the
agents,
some
of
whom
were
themselves
of
chinese
descent,
were
confident
agents
and
knew
the
area
and
knew
that
it
was
blackie
toy
who
run
the
laundry
or
perhaps
hom
way
gave
them
a
description
of
the
premises
without
telling
them
the
exact
address.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
sir.
there
were
two
wong's,
william
wong
and
alfred
wong.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
doesn't
appear.
and
for
all
we
know
that
may
have
been
in
chinese.
i
don't
say
it
was.
i
know
that
the
agent
was
chinese.
we
also
know
so
far
as
the
conversation
goes
justice
brennan
that
james
wah
toy
had
been
to
school
in
this
country
from
which
we
should
infer
that
he
lived
in
the
country
for
a
long
time.
we
know
that
he
testified
it
in
english.
we
know
that
he
was
able
to
read
his
confession
in
english
and
understood
and
could
--
understood
all
of
the
words
and
could
pronounce
all
but
one.
and
we
also
know
from
another
witness
who
had
known
him
back
to
1953
or
1954
i
think
it
was.
so
that
--
there's
really
not
the
slightest
reason
that
i
can
see
to
doubt
that
he
understood
the
events
i'm
about
to
come
to
that
happened
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
at
the
door.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
--
he
certainly
suggested
this.
he
was
drawing
inferences.
i
think
wild
speculative
inferences
from
the
fact
that
their
interpreter
is
present
at
the
trial.
but
if
you
read
what
happened
is
a
remark
at
the
trial
that
he's
testifying
in
english.
and
as
i
said,
there's
explicit
testimony
that
he
was
able
to
read
and
pronounce
all
the
words
in
his
statement
in
english,
and
there's
also
testimony
that
he
said
he
had
had
a
few
years
of
school.
and
there's
a
further
evidence
that
one
of
the
witnesses
knowing
back
as
i
say
round
1953
or
1954.
so
in
the
light
of
those
facts,
it
seems
to
me,
there
is
no
basis
for
assuming
that
he
didn't
understand
what
the
agent
meant
when
he
said
i'm
a
narcotics
agent
and
that
he
didn't
understand
the
badge
of
course
the
fact
that
he
then
slammed
the
door
and
then
turned
around
and
run.
it's
most
persuasive
that
he
understood
only
too
well.
it
--
i've
returned
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
agents
going.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
court
had
an
interpretive
presence.
there
were
several
members.
there
were
three
chinese
here.
and
it
does
appear
that
an
interpreter
was
appointed
for
the
trial.
it
also
appears
that
there
were
occasions
in
--
there
was
the
comment
during
the
examination
of
wah
toy
on
voir
dire
that
he
and
the
interpreter
we're
talking
back
and
forth.
and
i
think
it
was
the
court
that
it
may
have
been
counsel,
who
said
he's
testifying
in
english
but
they're
discussing
it
in
chinese.
apparently,
no
one
in
the
room
knew
what
was
said
in
the
chinese.
that's
the
full
evidence
on
what
happened
in
the
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
it
does
not.
it
does
appear
that
they
understood
each
other
well
enough
to
ask
for
the
laundry
and
to
be
told
to
come
back
later.
and
as
i
say,
it
appears
that
in
our
view,
he
knew
when
to
run.
i
come
back
to
the
point
of
the
propriety
of
the
agents
conduct
enduing
to
this
laundry.
they
went
at
6:30
in
the
morning
which
i
submit
under
the
circumstances
was
not
an
unreasonable
hour.
it
was
daylight.
8
o'clock
is
a
common
time
for
opening
businesses
in
that
community.
indeed,
wah
toy
was
going
to
open
his
day
at
8
o'clock.
there
was
some
urgency
about
pursuing
this
lead
there
and
there.
hom
way
had
been
arrested.
when
one
close
to
a
narcotics
group
has
been
arrested,
his
--
the
word
of
his
disappearance
spreads
rather
rapidly.
narcotics
are
very
easily
disposed
of.
if
you
took
too
long
in
pursuing
the
point,
they
might
be
disposed
of
in
the
interim.
now,
i
don't
suggest
that
hom
way's
information
taking
a
--
taking
alone
would
constitute
probable
cause.
we
do
submit
that
it
was
certainly
a
sufficient
reason
to
go
to
the
laundry
and
to
pursue
the
investigation
further.
so
the
laundry
went
--
so
the
investigator
went
to
the
laundry,
knocked
on
the
door,
i
emphasize
that
alton
wong
went
to
the
door
alone,
there
was
no
(inaudible)
at
the
door.
there
was
one
agent
thereby
himself
and
attempted
to
draw
the
man
who
came
to
the
door
into
conversation.
when
the
--
wah
toy,
as
it
turned
out
to
be,
attempted
to
break
off
the
conversation.
the
agent
took
out
his
badge,
said,
“i'm
a
narcotics
agent.”
and
at
that
point
and
only
then
that
wah
toy
slammed
the
door
and
run
down
the
hall
so
that
there
may
be
no
doubt
about
this.
let
me
ask
the
court
to
turn
to
the
relevant
passage
in
the
record.
on
page
51,
bottom
of
the
page
on
the
right
hand
side,
they
brought
the
witness
up
to
the
time
where
he
--
where
wah
--
wah
toy
told
him
to
come
back
and
the
witness
finished
there.
“and
at
that
time,
he
got
the
door
halfway
open
and
i
pulled
my
badge
out”,
describe
what
you
mean
by
halfway
open.
“he
get
the
door
one
hand
on
the
door.
the
door
is
open
about
--
i
would
say
about
30
degrees
open.
and
he
was
talking
to
me
through
the
door.
and
he
told
me
to
come
back
at
8
o'clock.
i
told
him
i
pulled
my
badge
out
and
told
him,
"i
am
a
federal
narcotics
agent.
and
at
that
time,
he
slammed
the
door
and
started
running.”
in
other
words,
after
he
pulled
his
badge
out,
the
agent
has
pulled
his
badge
out
and
after
he
had
said,
“i
am
a
narcotics
agent”.
running
where?”
“running
inside
his
living
quarter.”
“could
you
see
it?”
“yes,
sir.”
“what
is
it,
a
glass
door?”
“yes,
it
is
glass
door.”
“no
obstruction,
that
is
correct?”
“no,
sir.”
so
they
further
declaimed
that
this
wasn't
a
bursting
in,
simply
on
the
strength
of
what
hom
way
has
said.
it
was
a
bursting
in
after
a
man
who
had
fled
as
soon
as
he
was
informed
that
there
was
police.
and
bursting
in
after
a
man
as
to
whom
the
agent
already
had
some
information
tending
to
link
him
with
a
narcotics
violation.
at
this
point,
he
had
the
two
things.
he
had
the
statement
of
hom
way
that
wah
toy
has
been
dealing
in
narcotics
which
was
given
by
a
man
he
believed
to
be
reliable,
although
conceitedly
he
had
never
had
information
coming
before.
but
he
said
he
believed
him
to
be
reliable.
and
he
had
the
fact
that
the
minute
--
although
the
man
was
willing
to
talk
to
him,
open
the
door
when
he
knocked
on
it,
that
the
minute
he
said,
“i'm
a
narcotics
agent”
and
showed
his
badge
then
the
man
turned
and
ran.
we're
now
adding
the
information
from
hom
way
--
hom
way.
and
this
turning
and
running
together,
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
was
a
clearest
ground
for
the
evidence
to
conclude
--
for
the
agent
to
conclude
that
this
man
is
running
to
destroy
his
narcotics.
experience
as
a
narcotics
agent
would've
demonstrated
over
and
over
again
that
when
a
--
a
man
--
the
narcotics
train,
is
approach
of
by
an
agent
and
learns
that
he
is
an
agent.
the
first
thing
he
attempts
to
do
is
to
get
rid
of
the
narcotic
and
to
escape
perhaps
if
he
can
but
narcotics
can
so
easily
disposed
of
that
this
invariably
an
effort
to
slap
it
off
in
some
manner.
and
certainly,
the
agent
could
rationally
conclude
that
this
is
what
happened
here.
let
me
look
at
it
in
another
way.
why
else
would
the
man
have
run?
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
agent.
it's
certainly
no
reason
to
suppose
--
for
him
to
suppose
that
the
law
in
agent
was
a
burglar.
the
agent
himself
was
of
chinese
descent
like
wah
toy
so
i
do
not
think
one
can
present
a
picture
even
if
he
otherwise
could
to
be
a
stranger
in
the
city
confronted
with
a
lot
of
people
who
were
not
likely
to
be
sympathetic
to
him.
the
agent
had
identified
himself
before
wah
toy
ran.
and
so
again,
there
was
--
this
would
destroy
the
notion
of
the
burglary.
mr.
williams
says,
“well
this
was
the
erratic
behavior
of
a
victim
of
unreasonable
intrusion.
but
there
had
been
no
intrusion.
it's
only
when
you
jumble
the
facts
all
up
together
and
don't
take
the
situation
as
it
confronted
the
agent
at
that
time
which
is
the
decisive
question
that
you
can
say
that
this
was
the
result
of
the
erratic
behavior
resulting
from
an
unreasonable
intrusion
because
there'd
simply
been
none.
now,
i
would
concede
of
course
that
a
citizen
has
a
right
to
break
off
a
conversation
with
a
police
officer.
there
was
no
reason
why
wah
toy
shouldn't
have
simply
said,
“i
don't
care
to
talk
to
you,”
have
shut
the
door
and
gone
quietly
back
to
bed.
but
i
submit
that
one
would
not
--
who
is
a
that
frame
of
mind,
who
is
standing
on
the
sanctity
of
his
health,
wouldn't
suddenly
turn
at
the
moment
it
was
--
he
learn
this
man
was
a
narcotics
agent,
slam
the
door
and
run
back
to
the
other
part
of
the
house.
it
does
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
would
be
the
normal
way
to
react.
no
i
can't
think
of
any
other
explanations
that
the
agent
could
have
put
on
this
conduct.
there's
no
suggestion
that
he
--
that
wah
toy
had
smelled
his
breakfast
burning
and
runaway
for
that
reason
or
something
like
that.
toy
didn't
suggest
any
explanation.
toy
simply
said,
“it
didn't
happen
that
way.”
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
first
he
said
he
didn't
run
then
he
said
he
was
--
he
was
pushed
into
saying
he
was
taking
long
steps
but
i
take
it
that
the
district
judge
didn't'
believe
that
and
certainly
didn't
have
to
believe
it
ended
on
the
--
this
court
should
at
this
stage
take
the
fact
as
to
what
happened
in
the
terms
most
favorable
to
the
government.
wah
toy
told
several
difference
stories
about
this
incident
in
other
respect.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
officer
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
officer
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
first
asked
the
laundry.
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
later
entry.
and
it
hasn't
yet
been
held
that
an
officer
commits
any
wrong
if
he
uses
his
rules
to
draw
a
man
into
conversation.
indeed,
it
hasn't
yet
been
held
that
obtaining
entry
into
a
house
by
a
rules
is
a
--
if
the
entry
is
otherwise
--
if
the
search
is
otherwise
proper,
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
let
me
make
it
clear,
we
don't
have
that
here.
and
i
don't
think
the
propriety
of
the
attempted
rules
to
draw
the
man
into
conversation
in
anyway
takes
the
right
upon
probab
--
finding
a
probably
cause
to
go
into
the
building
and
to
make
the
arrest.
i
don't
want
to
stress
the
point
too
much
but
let's
look
at
this
from
the
agent's
point
of
view
and
say
what
else
should
he
have
done
because
i
think
when
you
ask
that
question,
it
becomes
even
clearer
that
it
was
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest.
and
certainly
at
this
stage,
he
shouldn't
trap
the
man.
i
take
it
nobody
would
say
that
he
should
have
gone
away
and
said,
well
that's
not
a
very
coro
--
cooperative
citizen
but
we
will
forget
the
whole
thing.
should
he
have
gone
and
try
to
get
arrest
with
search
warrants
then
and
there?
if
he
had,
he's
certainly
risk
the
distraction
of
the
contraband.
as
i
said
before,
there
is
one
sure
thing
that
anybody
engage
in
the
narcotics
trap
attempts
to
do
is
to
get
rid
of
the
morphine
or
heroin
or
whatever
it
is
when
the
police
come
close,
and
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
can
be
done
very
quickly.
it's
something
to
be
washed
right
down
the
drain.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i'm
aware
that
it
has
but
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
that
issue
was
presented.
mr.
archibald
cox
here,
there
was
no
opportunity.
and
here
too,
if
he
hadn't
acted
quickly,
there
was
an
opportunity
for
wah
toy
to
warn
any
co-conspirators
and
for
wah
toy
to
escape.
now,
some
of
those
possibilities
could
have
been
minimized
by
calling
the
agents
half
a
block
away
and
posting
them
at
the
doors
of
the
house.
but
i
suppose
they
would
have
had
no
more
right
to
arrest
wah
toy
when
he
came
out
than
the
agent
had
to
arrest
him
then
and
there
when
he
fled.
and
certainly,
posting
the
man
outside
would
not
have,
in
anyway,
prevented
the
destruction
of
the
heroin
or
prevented
warning
co-conspirators
of
the
appellant.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
make
no
such
argument.
we
stand
and
all
i
--
the
two
combinations
of
the
two
bits
of
evidence.
to
this
extent
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
differ
very
strongly
with
the
court
below.
we
think
that
the
attempt
to
lay
down
a
--
sort
of
a
subordinate
rule
about
probable
cause
applicable
to
informers
by
the
court
below
where
it
says
that
if
the
informer
has
previously
given
the
information
that
proved
reliable
then
his
tip
constitutes
probable
cause.
but
if
he
hasn't,
it
isn't
probable
cause.
we
think
that
is
a
very
grave
mistake,
and
we're
much
concern
about
that
as
a
general
proposition
because
we
think
that
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
there
is
probably
cause
that
whether
a
--
information
from
an
informer
constitutes
probable
cause,
depends
on
many
things
other
than
just
whether
he
has
given
the
information
before.
it
depends
on
who
he
is,
his
station
in
the
community,
what
is
known
about
him
or
what
kind
of
evidence
he
gives.
indeed
in
the
draper
case,
if
the
court
will
recall,
was
given
in
great
detail
and
it
was
possible
to
verify.
so,
i
do
want
to
say
that
we
are
concerned
about
the
court's
declaration.
we
think
that
it
made
a
basic
mistake
there.
but
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
come
back
again
to
a
direct
answer
to
your
question.
no,
i
do
not
assert
that
on
the
basis
of
hom
way's
statements
alone,
the
agents
would
have
been
justified
in
making
the
arrest.
we
think
more
important
than
that
was
this
flight
and
flight
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
was
the
flight
from
the
agent
the
minute
the
man
learned
the
retreat
if
that's
a
more
acceptable
word
but
turning
and
running
which
is
what
he
did
and
over
and
over
again
in
cases.
the
court's
have
held
almost
without
exception
that
running
away
from
one
known
to
be
a
--
an
officer
investigating
a
crime
is
itself,
the
strongest
kind
of
evidence
furnishing
probable
cause.
now,
i
don't
say
that
that
alone
would
have
constituted
reason
to
breakthrough
the
door
and
to
make
the
arrest.
but
here,
there
was
the
two
together
and
the
two
together
and
taking
the
agent's
position,
we
think
certainly
gave
him
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
this
man
was
concealing
or
had
concealed
heroin
and
that's
enough
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
there's
one
illustration
that
is
very
close
indeed,
i
don't
want
to
bother
the
court
of
precedents
because
this
case
is
on
probable
cause
turn
very
much
on
their
own
fact.
but
there
is
a
case
decided
in
california
where
the
agents
were
somewhat
more
information
from
an
informer
than
there
was
here
and
some
other
confirmatory
evidence
went
to
a
house
where
they
thought
narcotics
were
concealed
and
knocked
on
the
door
and
when
the
man
came,
he
discovered
they
were
police
officers.
he
slammed
the
door
in
their
faces
and
they
could
hear
his
steps
running
into
the
inside
of
the
apartment.
the
california
courts
held
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
go
in
under
those
circumstances
and
they
did
see
is
the
narcotic.
under
such
circumstances,
the
court
said
the
act
of
the
man
in
slamming
and
locking
the
door
indicated
that
the
man
was
fleeing
from
and
attempting
to
prevent
the
officer
from
apprehending
him.
the
information
which
the
officer
had
received
and
the
conduct
of
the
appellant
in
the
presence
of
the
officer
constituted
probable
cause
to
arrest
appellant.
we
think
the
basic
mistake
of
the
court
below
was
in
taking
these
two
things
each
separately.
it
may
well
have
been
true
that
the
information
given
by
hom
way
alone
did
not
constitute
probable
cause.
it
might
well
have
been
that
if
this
had
happened
with
the
officer
who
had
gone
up
to
the
door
with
no
reason
to
go
there
and
other
lack
of
information
and
the
man
turned
and
fled
that
that
alone
wouldn't
constitute
probable
cause.
but
i
submit
that
anyone
in
the
position
of
this
officer
when
he
had
the
two
bits
of
information,
who
has
had
--
who
had
to
face
the
question,
“what
do
i
do
now?”
would
have
answered
by
saying,
“it
is
my
duty
to
arrest
this
man.”
so
he
went
in
and
followed
him.
now,
if
--
if
he
did
have
probable
cause
in
that
stage
then
of
course
the
arrest
is
lawful
and
the
whole
of
the
petitioner's
case
collapses.
there
is
one
other
point
which
i
should
--
with
which
i
should
deal
before
leaving
this
matter
of
probable
cause
to
arrest
wah
toy.
the
agent
pushed
through
and
broke
the
lock
on
the
door,
broke
the
door
right
around
the
lock
one
or
the
other,
immediately
that
he
heard
wah
toy
--
saw
wah
toy
attempt
to
slam
the
door
and
saw
through
the
glass
door,
he
couldn't
miss
any
of
this,
wah
toy
running
down
the
hallway.
the
agent
did
not
stop
and
say
again,
“we
are
police.
i
have
come
to
arrest
you.
i
asked
admission.”
in
other
words,
the
argument
is
made
to
the
court
that
there
was
a
failure
to
conform
with
the
various
statutory
rule
laid
down
in
miller
against
the
united
states.
but
note
that
this
was
not
a
case
of
coming
and
breaking
into
the
door
or
climbing
into
the
window
without
any
previous
announcement
to
the
occupant.
indeed,
there
was
an
announcement
and
it
was
the
announcement
that
led
the
occupant
to
try
to
slam
the
door
and
run.
the
court
in
the
miller
case
or
this
case
we
submit
comes
within
the
well-recognized
exception
that
announcement
is
unnecessary
where
the
officer
has
reason
to
believe
that
it's
useless
or
that
it
will
result
in
the
destruction
of
evidence
or
the
destruction
of
contraband.
in
the
miller
case
itself
acknowledged
that
there
were
state
decisions
holding
the
justification
for
noncompliance
exist
in
exigent
circumstances.
as
for
example,
when
the
officers
may
say
in
--
may
in
good
faith
believe
that
the
person
arrested
is
fleeing
or
attempting
to
destroy
evidence,
plainly,
this
is
such
a
case.
the
same
rule
has
been
recognized
by
the
california
courts,
and
the
same
rule
has
been
announced
by
the
american
law
institute
in
the
restatement
of
torts.
so
that
i
think
there
is
really
nothing
here
to
the
point
that
some
further
announcement
was
necessary
to
make
this
arrest
proper.
i
turn
now,
although
mr.
williams
do
not
stress
it
in
argument,
to
the
point
that
he
argues
in
his
brief
to
it
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
of
wong
sun.
in
this
instance,
it
seems
to
us
that
there's
really
no
merit
to
the
argument
at
all.
when
the
officers
went
to
arrest
wong
sun,
they
had
the
statement
of
johnny
yee.
johnny
yee,
you'll
remember
is
the
man
to
whom
wah
toy
had
appointment,
and
said
he
has
the
narcotic,
he's
the
man
who
sells
narcotics.
and
it
was
in
johnny
yee's
house
that
the
agents
found
something
less
than
the
ounce
of
heroines.
johnny
yee
said
that
he
got
the
heroin
from
"sea
dog.”
and
--
but
he
couldn't
say
who
"sea
dog"
was.
he
just
knew
him
as
a
man
named
"sea
dog.”
here
is
one
item
that
the
agents
had
when
they
went
to
arrest
wong
sun.
and
this
statement
by
johnny
yee
was
certainly
supported
by
the
fact
that
johnny
yee
did
have
narcotics.
they
no
longer
just
a
tip,
it
was
a
tip
by
somebody
who
had
the
narcotics
which
gave
some
support
to
it.
furthermore,
this
information
fitted
in
with
toy's
assertion
that
yee
had
the
narcotics.
and
it
was
corroborated
that
toy's
statement
was
corroborated
by
his
close
description
of
the
inside
of
johnny
yee's
house
and
of
the
habits
of
johnny
yee's
friend.
in
addition,
the
agents,
before
they
went
to
arrest
wong
sun,
had
toy's
identification
of
“sea
dog.”
they'd
identified
him,
they
told
where
his
house
was
and
indeed
he
took
him
to
the
house
and
pointed
it
out.
so
that
this
--
this
corroborated
but
yee
had
said
still
further,
“you
had
two
men
giving
information”,
according
to
wong
sun.
i
think
the
agents
were
also
entitled
to
take
into
the
account
although
it
was
fairly
remote
that
hom
way's
original
story
had
put
them
on
this
trail
although
it
did
not
work
out
exactly
as
hom
way
has
said.
and
finally,
the
record
does
contain
that
some
indications
that
the
agents
knew
“sea
dog”
have
awe.
one
of
the
agents
when
they
we
--
went
to
make
the
arrest
and
greeted
sea
dog's
wife
by
her
first
name.
she
apparently
knew
him.
and
we
know
that
“sea
dog”
had
had
a
prior
conviction.
so
that
again
while
this
is
slate
and
i
think
the
information
from
yee
and
toy
are
the
crucial
thing,
this
still
more
gave
reasonable
grounds
for
believes
that
wong
sun
was
guilty
of
concealing
narcotics.
now
in
his
case,
there's
no
argument
directly
that
the
manner
of
making
the
arrest
of
the
agents'
testimony
meant
as
it
is
plain
that
they
were
admitted
by
his
wife
and
sister
and
that
the
wife
said
that
he
was
in
a
certain
room
that
they
then
went
in
and
arrest
him.
so
i
submitted
in
conclusion
upon
this
point
that
as
in
the
case
of
wah
toy,
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
of
wong
sun
and
that
the
case
the
petitioner
made
for
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence,
the
foundation
is
called
out
from
under
and
that
the
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
below
without
ever
reaching
the
question
of
whether
the
exclusionary
rules
would
keep
this
out
--
evidence
out
if
the
arrest
were
unlawful.
i
would
like
now
to
go
on
and
consider
that
point
since
it
was
in
the
opinion
below
and
the
ground
on
which
that
court
rested
and
has
been
briefed
and
argued
here.
we
submit
that
even
if
the
entry
into
wah
toy's
house
and
his
arrest
were
unlawful,
nevertheless,
the
narcotics
found
in
another
house
pursuant
to
toy's
direct
and
the
confessions
made
five
days
later
when
these
men
weren't
even
in
custodies
were
properly
admitted
in
evidence.
and
we
make
the
same
contention
with
respect
to
the
statement
by
wah
toy
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
that
narcotics
would
be
found
in
johnny
yee's
house.
now
of
course,
i
concede
that
there
is
a
well-established
general
rule
that
excludes
from
admission
in
evidence
after
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure
all
physical
evidence,
seized
as
the
result
of
the
unlawful
search,
all
observations
made
by
the
police
while
unlawfully
in
the
premises,
any
conversation
overheard
by
the
police
while
unlawfully
in
the
building
and
in
addition,
any
other
evidence
which
is
the
direct
product
of
the
government's
unlawful
action.
plainly,
the
first
three
categories
that
we
can
set
aside
as
irrelevant
here,
there
was
nothing
tangible
seized
at
wah
toy's
house.
and
there's
no
claim
that
there
was
an
unlawful
search
or
indeed
any
search
at
johnny
yee's
house
because
he
voluntarily
handed
over
the
narcotics.
there
was
nothing
observed
at
wah
toy's
house.
there
are
no
conversations
overheard
as
in
the
spyke
case
which
were
improperly
obtained
by
the
agents.
the
confessions
of
the
heroin
was
taken
from
yee's,
the
confessions
as
i
say
came
five
days
later
and
the
statement,
“you
can
go
to
yee's
to
get
the
narcotics,”
we
contend
was
voluntarily
given
and
related
only
by
coincidence
in
time
to
the
assumed
to
be
unlawful
arrest
and
that
no
sense
a
product
of
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
shall.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
it
does.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i've
--
i
submitted
that
it
was
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
there
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
yes
--
yes,
i
--
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
it's
found
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
it
took
place
in
--
i
would
state
accurately,
the
statement
was
made
while
they
were
there
unlawfully
on
the
premises.
there
was
certainly
a
coincidence
in
point
of
time.
and
i
suppose
that
one
would
not
have
occurred
but
for
the
other
thing
--
but
for
an
action
would
certainly
satisfy.
the
fruit
of
the
poison
tree
doctrine,
we
submit,
does
not
bar
from
evidence
everything
that
comes
into
the
possession
of
the
government
that
is
found
in
the
sense
that
justice
frankfurter
was
just
using
the
word
after
an
unlawful
search
seizure.
the
original
case
silverthorne
was
of
course
one
where
the
connection
was
very
mediate.
the
government
was
seeking
to
put
in
an
evidence
photostats
of
materials,
they
never
would
have
known
existed
but
for
the
unlawful
entry.
in
nardone,
the
court
held
that
it
was
error
to
prevent
inquiry
into
whether
the
government's
other
evidence
had
been
achieved
as
a
result
of
the
original
unlawful
wiretapping.
the
case
was
reversed
for
the
purposes
of
making
that
affirmed.
even
in
nardone,
the
court
said
that
as
a
matter
of
good
sense,
however,
such
connection
may
become
so
attenuated
as
to
dissipate
the
tape
--
tape.
what
we
have
i
suggest,
is
a
question
of
proximity
and
degree.
the
aim
here
is
certainly
to
eliminate
the
incentive
for
misconduct
by
the
police.
it's
to
avoid
stultifying
and
debasing
the
court
by
convicting
man
of
crime
on
the
basis
of
evidence
obtained
through
crime.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
also
been
--
has
also
been
the
effort
of
the
court,
it's
clear
in
this
on
several
occasion,
to
avoid
the
mistake
of
immunizing
those
who
may
be
guilty
of
simply
because
of
the
misconduct
of
the
government
agent.
there's
a
balance
to
be
struck.
and
i
would
say
that
the
way
to
strike
it
was
in
terms
of
appraising
the
relationship
between
the
misconduct
and
the
evidence
sought
to
be
used.
now,
i'd
like
next
to
illustrate
to
the
court
--
put
to
the
court
a
number
of
illustrations
in
support
of
those
general
observations.
i
do
not
contend
that
they're
on
all
force
with
this
case
but
i
will
come
closer
to
this
case
as
i
go
through
in
the
sense
the
preposition
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
a
man
who
has
been
the
victim
of
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure
may
nevertheless
be
prosecuted.
i
suppose
that
his
plea
of
guilty
may
in
some
remote
sense
be
stimulated
by
the
fact
that
the
agents
walked
in
on
him
when
he
was
in
possession
of
the
--
of
the
contraband
or
the
instruments
of
crime.
nevertheless,
the
mere
fact
that
such
a
guilty
plea
follows
after
an
unlawful
search
that
does
not
make
it
legally
irrelevant
and
of
course
the
conviction
based
on
such
a
plea
withstand.
there's
an
interesting
case
here
in
the
district
circuit
which
illustrates
the
point.
in
(inaudible)
against
the
united
states
as
the
name
of
the
case,
in
this
case
the
man
was
unlawfully
detained
at
the
police
station.
during
the
period
of
unlawful
detention,
one
of
the
victims
of
the
crime
came
in
and
identified
him.
and
later,
the
victim
testified
at
the
trial
that
this
was
the
man.
he
argued
that
since
he'd
brought
to
the
victim's
--
brought
to
the
witnesses'
attention
during
the
unlawful
detention
that
this
testimony
should
not
be
admitted
but
the
court
held
that
it
was
admissible
and
deferring
conviction.
again
in
the
bynum
case,
a
man
was
fingerprinted
during
an
unlawful
detention.
it
was
held
that
those
fingerprints
could
not
be
used
as
evidence
to
compare
with
the
fingerprints
left
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
and
the
original
conviction
was
reversed.
but
when
the
case
came
back
based
upon
evidence
of
the
man's
fingerprints
taken
from
the
fbi
files
compared
with
those
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
the
court,
the
same
court
held
that
conviction
was
proper
even
though
in
the
sense
the
original
fingerprint
and
original
comparison
had
led
to
the
idea
that
they
should
get
out
bynum's
prints
from
a
standing
fbi
file.
perhaps
a
closer
case
in
point
is
united
states
against
bayer
where
the
court
will
remember
that
it
was
held
with
only
one
justice
dissenting
that
a
second
confession
given
by
a
man
who
had
already
confessed
during
a
period
of
unlawful
detention
was
nevertheless
admissible
in
evidence
if
it
was
indeed
voluntary.
and
the
court
recognized
that
the
original
confession
undoubtedly
played
some
part
in
the
later
decision
to
confess
but
said
that
this
is
too
remote
from
the
wrong
by
the
police
and
permitted
the
conviction
to
stand.
finally,
there
are
a
very
considerable
number
of
cases
holding
that
confessions
given
after
an
unlawful
arrest
are
admissible
in
evidence.
this
is
--
i
don't
mean
confessions,
during
an
unlawful
detention,
i
--
i'm
not
saying
anything
inconsistent
with
the
mcnabb
case.
i'm
speaking
simply
of
a
confession
made
immediately
after
an
arrest
without
probable
cause
or
a
confession
made
sometime
later
where
the
original
arrest
is
challenged
but
there
has
been
no
unlawful
detention.
in
those
cases,
the
second,
fifth,
ninth,
tenth
and
district
of
columbia
circuits
have
all
held
the
confession
to
be
admissible
in
evidence.
and
there
a
fair
number
of
state
court
cases
even
in
states
that
had
followed
the
exclusionary
rule
of
silverthorne
which
have
held
that
such
confessions
are
admissible.
now,
let
me
apply
that
latter
rule
to
some
of
the
evidence
that
petitioner
seeks
to
have
excluded.
the
confessions
here
were
made
four
days
after
the
arrest.
by
that
time,
the
man
had
been
arraigned
that
originally
bail
had
been
set
and
then
on
the
motion
of
the
united
states,
they
had
been
released
on
their
own
recognizance.
they
weren't
even
in
custody
at
the
time
they
made
the
confession.
mr.
archibald
cox
they've
been
before
united
states
commissioner.
they
were
taken
on
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
before
the
united
states
commissioner.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they
were
charged
with
narcotics
violations.
the
bail
was
set.
and
then
later
in
that
day,
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
at
the
request
of
the
narcotics
bureau
went
back
and
asked
the
commissioner
to
reduce
them
on
their
own
recognizance.
and
they
did
it.
i
will
be
happy
to
see
that
it
gets
to
the
clerk
one
photostats
of
the
record,
of
the
proceedings
before
the
commissioner.
if
i
can
have
ten
made,
i
will
do
it
but
this
is
a
photostatic
copy
and
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
can
be
recopied.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
seems
to
me
utterly
irrelevant.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
all
i
can
tell
is
that
the
--
the
record
shows
that
on
the
june
5,
this
is
for
wong
sun
a
warrant
was
issued
to
the
united
states
marshal.
there
is
no
return.
i
think
that
they
were
all
right
there
at
the
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
anymore
about
it.
it
appears
here.
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
no
return
from
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
which
i
infer
--
from
which
infer
that
wong
sun
was
physically
present
in
the
proceeding
before
the
commissioner
when
the
warrant
was
issued.
but
that
is
purely
inference
from
this
doctrine.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
there
were
two
proceedings,
the
one
--
the
one
for
james
wah
toy
and
johnny
yee.
there
was
one
proceeding
involving
johnny
yee
and
james
wah
toy
dated
june
4.
that's
the
day
they
were
at
the
laundry.
and
again,
a
warrant
that
shows
that
a
warrant
was
issued
for
the
arrest
of
johnny
wee
--
johnny
yee
and
james
wah
toy,
the
u.s.
marshal
or
rather
authorized
officer.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
--
there
are
only
two
possibilities
and
i
can't
tell
you
how
--
which
is
the
correct
one.
one
is
that
they
had
not
been
arrested
and
that
wah
toy
on
the
fourth
after
questioning
him
at
his
house
had
not
been
immediately
taken
down
to
the
narcotics
office
and
that
later,
they
got
warrant
for
his
arrest.
the
other
possibility
is
that
he
was
detained
and
held
until
he
was
released
on
his
own
recognizance
at
--
well,
it
doesn't
say
--
it
doesn't
say
the
exact
hour
or
at
least
it's
not
legible.
it
simply
says
that
the
$5000
bail
was
reduced
to
order
releasing
each
defendant
on
his
own
recognizance.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
--
we
don't
have
any
additional
information.
i
do
--
mr.
williams
made
something
of
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
utterly
irrelevant.
i
doubt
very
much
whether
any
inference
adverse
to
the
agents
could
be
thought
at
the
time
they
went
before
the
commissioner.
anyway,
the
arrest
was
completed
at
that
point.
the
question
is
what
they
thought
they
were
doing
and
what
they
did
do
back
at
the
time
they
went
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes,
sir.
they
were
given
on
june
9
long
after
they
have
been
re
--
long
after
eight
hours
--
three
days
after
they
have
been
released
on
their
own
recognizance.
and
there's
elaborate
testimony
on
the
record,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
you.
there's
elaborate
testimony
in
the
record
that
they
came
down
to
the
narcotics
office
and
there's
the
usual
description
of
what
the
agent
said
to
them
and
that
they
voluntarily
signed
this
statement.
there
was
three
days
in
between.
by
any
irregardless
of
what
the
question
is
as
to
their
status
between
the
arrest
and
the
formal
release
on
their
own
recognizance.
there
were
three
additional
days.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
it
--
it's
my
position
that
it
fits
in
for
the
exception.
but
of
course,
my
view
of
the
law
is
not
quite
the
same
as
his.
i
would
say
that
not
on
--
that
this
--
i
would
say
first
that
the
mcnabb
rule
to
what
he
says
creates
an
exception
is
not
a
rule
dealing
with
arrests
at
all.
it's
a
rule
dealing
with
unlawful
detention.
and
so
far
as
i
know,
there
has
never
been
a
decision
in
this
court
or
indeed
any
other
court
except
to
possibly
the
nueslein
case
in
which
the
mere
fact
that
(inaudible)
was
unlawfully
arrested
was
held
to
be
grounds
for
excluding
a
voluntary
confession,
such
scattered
law
as
there
is
dealing
with
confessions
made
during
improper
searches
and
seizures
are
moved
from
the
unlawful
arrest.
the
search
and
seizure
such
laws
there
is,
is
entirely
in
our
favor
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
nueslein
case.
now,
i
want
to
suggest
this
very
important
distinction
to
your
honors.
i
think
cases
that
i
referred
to
and
we've
cited
in
our
brief
are
consistent.
there
are
certainly
some
statements
made
during
an
unlawful
search
or
seizure
which
i
properly
excluded
from
evidence.
the
best
illustration
perhaps,
the
clearest
illustration
is
the
case
in
mississippi,
harris
against
the
state.
in
the
first
case,
quan
against
the
state
which
we
refer
to,
the
court
had
held
although
they
had
the
exclusionary
rule
like
the
federal
rule
that
a
confession
or
a
statement,
an
admission
made
during
an
unlawful
search
was
admissible
in
evidence
if
it
was
truly
voluntarily.
it
said
there
was
no
necessary
or
essential
connection
between
an
illegal
search
and
statements
freely
and
voluntarily
made
to
the
officers,
and
it
went
on
to
like
in
the
making
of
such
statement
to
a
consent
to
a
search.
now,
this
later
case
came
up
in
which
the
police
had
unlawfully
seize
a
man's
suitcase.and
then
they
ask
the
man,
what's
in
it?
and
the
man
said
whiskey.
it's
within
a
dry
area.
and
the
court
held
that
the
admission
as
to
what
was
in
the
suitcase
that
the
police
were
obviously
going
to
open
and
look
at
was
--
that
that
was
as
inadmissible
in
evidence
as
if
they
had
opened
the
suitcase.
and
i
choose
the
mississippi
cases
because
it
contrast
the
harris
case
with
the
earlier
case
found
against
the
state
which
makes
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
and
that
is
that
the
question
is
whether
the
admission
or
confession
just
happens
to
be
coincident
with
the
search
in
point
of
time
but
it's
really
the
product
of
a
voluntary
exercising
will
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
or
whether
it
is
in
some
way
the
result
of
the
pressure
put
on
him
by
the
unlawful
search.
now,
in
the
suitcase
case
is
obviously
it
is.
the
nueslein
case
comes
close
to
ours
but
i
think
it's
rather
distinguishable
on
that
same
ground.
the
officers
in
nueslein
went
in
to
the
taxi
driver's
house
either
opening
the
door
or
the
door
was
opened,
i
don't
know
which
it
was.
there
was
no
one
there,
somehow
rose
people
upstairs,
and
the
taxi
driver
was
upstairs
in
the
bathroom,
and
he
came
down
the
stairs
10
or
15
minutes
later.
and
in
that
stage,
he
made
admissions
about
driving
the
car
it
was
evidently
and
visibly
intoxicated.
now,
there
are
two
factors
i
think
which
go
to
suggest
that
he
--
this
was
not
a
free
and
voluntary
statement.
one
was
that
he's
been
drinking.
it
was
a
statement
obtained
from
him
while
he
was
under
the
influence
of
intoxicant.
another
was
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
is
one
where
he
was
under
considerable
pressure
to
explain
his
condition.
for
example,
as
the
case
cited
by
the
petitioners
in
delaware
case
and
brinegar
against
the
state
in
which
the
officers
had
unlawfully
arrested
a
man.
he
was
later
tried
for
some
offense
where
there
had
to
be
proofs
that
he'd
been
drinking
whether
it
was
a
driving
under
the
influence
of
liquor
or
manslaughter
or
something
like
that.
i
don't
know.
and
the
agents
testified
about
his
conduct
during
the
period
of
the
unlawful
arrest
and
detention.
there
wasn't
any
admission.
i
think
nueslein
that
comes
very
close
to
that.
the
only
additional
fact
is
that
he
did
attempt
to
give
us
some
explanations
about
himself,
but
it
seems
to
me,
there
were
pressures
to
try
and
explain
a
way
what
the
officer
had
unlawfully
obtained.
now,
here
in
our
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
on
first
place
the
only
offense
was
a
misdemeanor
and
it
wasn't
commented
in
their
presence.
and
therefore,
there
was
no
right
to
make
an
arrest
without
warrant
at
all.
they
did
go
into
the
man's
house
whether
to
arrest
him
or
to
search
or
to
ask
questions.
no
one
knows.
it
was
an
unlawful
entry.
they
had
no
permission
--
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
remember,
he
was
taking
down
to
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
police
station
later.
afterwards,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
know
if
he'd
been
told
--
oh
when
he
first
shouted
down,
there
hasn't
been
any
arrest.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
think
that
the
police
officers
to
walk
in
to
his
house
was
an
illegality.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
that
i
--
i
quite
agree
because
one
of
the
--
it's
a
question
whether
the
agents
have
gone
in
for
the
purpose
of
getting
unlawful
evidence
or
whether
they
have
been
called
on
to
make
the
judgment
often
in
closed
questions
and
then
to
attribute
this
interim
consequences.
they
really
don't
serve
the
purpose
at
all.
the
--
well,
to
--
to
try
and
pull
--
try
and
pull
this
together,
our
position
with
respect
to
these
oral
statements
is
first
that
the
confession,
as
i
think
i've
shown,
were
frightfully
remote
both
in
terms
of
intervening
events,
in
terms
of
the
time
and
in
terms
of
the
exercise
of
freewill
--
of
a
exercising
freewill
by
the
man
who
confessed
from
any
even
arguably
unlawful
entry.
the
statement
made
by
wah
toy,
i
would
point
out,
was
not
even
a
confession.
it
certainly
wasn't
an
effort
to
explain
away
something
the
agents
had
found.
there
was
no
pressure
of
that
conduct.
it
was
an
effort
perhaps
to
divert
suspicion
from
himself.
he
said,
“no,
i've
never
done
anything
wrong
but
go
over
johnny
yee
house.”
so
that
it's
quite
different
from
the
case
in
which
--
or
the
arrest
has
caused
the
search,
has
uncovered
something
which
the
owner
of
the
house
feels
impelled
to
try
to
explain
a
way.
it's
rather
like
a
--
other
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
a
man
was
arrested.
it
was
alleged
that
there
was
not
probable
cause.
as
soon
as
he
was
arrested,
he
produced
a
small
quantity
of
narcotics
and
turned
it
over
to
the
agent.
later,
they
searched
him
and
found
a
large
quantity
of
narcotics.
and
the
circuit
court
here
held
that
the
small
quantity
was
admissible
in
evidence
whereas
if
he
turned
over
the
whole
thing
because
he
says,
“there
was
no
use.
you're
rampaging
through
my
clothes.
i'll
give
it
to
you.”
of
course,
it
wouldn't
have
been
admissible
in
evidence.
and
i
think
the
significant
difference
is
that
the
way
he
did
it
showed
that
this
was
a
calculated
act
which
he
had
--
had
chose
to
do
or
not
to
do
and
not
of
the
result
of
something
forced
upon
him
by
the
illegal
conduct
of
the
police.
and
so
here,
yee's
statements,
that
was
the
kind
of
statement,
it
was
in
the
clearance
so
far
as
anything
in
his
housewife,
was
the
kind
of
calculated
effort
to
get
the
police
to
go
somewhere
else
and
think
well
of
him
which
cannot
be
regarded
as
the
product
of
any
overpowering
influence
by
the
presence
of
the
officers.
now,
the
remaining
question
in
the
case
is
whether
the
confessions
were
sufficiently
corroborated
by
other
efforts.
we've
dealt
with
this
in
detail
in
our
briefs.
the
chief
corroboration
here
just
to
devote
a
sentence
or
two
to
it
is
of
course
the
finding
of
the
narcotic.
there
they
were
and
you
will
note
if
you
examine
it
with
the
care
that
the
exact
quantity
of
narcotics
found
tallies
very
closely
with
the
confession
saying
that
we
took
one
piece,
one
ounce
of
heroin
to
johnny
yee's.
and
then
later,
we
smoked
some
of
it
because
the
amount
that
was
gone
was
a
small
amount,
just
about
equivalent
to
what
they
might
have
smoked
on
the
two
nights
in
question.
again,
the
interplay
of
the
knowledge
of
each
of
these
two
men
and
so
far
as
johnny
yee
testified
his
knowledge
in
the
others
tends
to
show
that
the
confessions
were
trustworthy
that
they
were
not
the
product
of
a
disordered
mind
or
one
pressured
into
erratic
behavior
by
the
fact
that
he
was
arrested
and
charged
with
crime.
we
submit,
therefore,
your
honor
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed
but
on
the
first
ground
i
argued
with
the
second
left
i
think
more
wisely,
although
we
believe
we're
right
to
some
future
occasion.
