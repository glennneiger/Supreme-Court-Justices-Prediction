l.

mr.
williams,
you
said
when
the
--
an
unlawful
arrest
is
shown,
the
burden
shift
to
the
government,
are
you
saying
by
that
that
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
the
arrest
was
unlawful?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
arrest
was
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
was
evidence
that
tended
to
show
or
do
you
mean
a
presumption
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
other
questions
that
crucially
supported
your
concern
except
that
one,
as
to
whether
circumstances
here,
shown
in
the
evidence,
the
arrest
was
legal
or
illegal,
does
that
settle
your
controversy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
finding
by
anyone,
is
that
the
crucial
element
in
deciding
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
the
evidence,
like
i
said,
there
can
be
an
inference
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
should
be
an
inference
found
that
the
arrest
was
unlawful.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
starting
back
behind
in
the
statement.
is
it
--
suppose
this
arrest
was
not
unlawful
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
your
case
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
it,
it's
the
only
issue
in
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
two
o'clock
in
the
morning,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
time
did
the
united
states
commissioner
opened
their
office?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this?
you
have
indicated
that
you
do
not
want
to
decide
or
to
take
a
position
on
whether
the
evidence
after
that
time
would
have
justified
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant.
suppose
he
had
gone
to
the
officer
then,
is
it
your
position
now
that
by
the
joint
information,
collective
information
in
terms
from
hom
way
plus
the
man
running,
would
that
justify
the
issuance
of
search
warrant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
understand
you
to
take
the
position
to
either
you
can
arrest
a
man
on
the
ground
that
has
probable
cause
when
the
evidence
would
not
support
the
finding
issued
to
the
search
warrant
by
a
magistrate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
not
be
less
or
more?
it
doesn't
have
to
be
less
or
more?
