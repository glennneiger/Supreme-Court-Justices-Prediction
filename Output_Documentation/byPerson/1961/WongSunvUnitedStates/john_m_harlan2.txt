justice
john
m.
harlan
is
he
the
gentleman
whose
name
is
on
the
papers?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
before
you
leave
the
other
gentleman
mr.
toy.
you
don't
refer
at
all
to
the
impact
whether
the
word
of
wei
hom's
original
information
upon
the
character
or
the
acts
of
this
defendant
when
they've
hurried
to
pursue
him
down
the
hall,
weren't
the
agents
entitled
to
take
that
into
account
in
assessing
the
--
for
drawing
inferences
on
what
is
quite
meant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
address
of
this
laundry
was
not
--
that
cannot
be
tied
up
to
the
restaurant
which
hom
way
gave?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
rely
on
the
fruit's
doctrine
and
of
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
got
thrown
off
by
your
reference
to
mcnabb.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
fruit's
doctrine
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
something
different
from
the
mcnabb
line
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
thing
that
confuses
me
is
i
don't
understand
what
mcnabb
and
mallory
got
to
do
with
your
argument.
i
understand
that
he
--
i
understand
the
fruit's
doctrine
alright,
and
i
would
suppose
that
was
the
essence
of
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
mcnabb
and
mallory
is
simply
a
prophylactic
rule
that
the
courts
laid
down
under
its
supervisory
powers
and
you're
saying
that
that
should
be
extended
to
this
kind
of
a
case,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
i
understand
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
this
maybe
a
little
awkward
be.
do
you
know
whether
it's
the
usual
practice
in
narcotic
enforcement
to
arrest
that
out
of
warrant
in
view
of
the
statute
--
in
view
of
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
said
he
was
taking
long
steps?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
claim
on
your
part
that
hom
way
was
illegally
arrested?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
--
it's
not
part
of
your
argument
in
other
words.
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
hom
way,
as
for
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
the
--
i
thought
they
conceded
that
he
might
be
his
guest.
i
thought
you
said
that
a
fortiori
when
the
(inaudible)
happened.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
they
say
--
that
they
don't
have
to
stand
on
that
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
said
that,
is
that
wrong?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
your
real
contention
is
the
absence
of
an
oath
makes
a
difference.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
as
i
understand
justice
clark,
that
as
long
he
brought
the
commissioner
out
of
bed,
to
wake
him
out
of
bed
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning,
he
would
have
had
hom
way
swear
everything
he
said
or
he
has
told,
that
he
told
the
agent,
it
would
have
been
the
duty
of
the
commissioner
to
issue
the
warrant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
court
of
appeals
deal
with
that
contention?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
overruled
you
on
that,
didn't
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
does
go
down
this
chain
reaction
names,
is
wong
tang
the
same
as
sea
dog?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that's
wong
sun?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
anything
in
the
record
indicating
whether
or
not
these
two
petitioners
had
been
convicted
in
narcotic
offenses
before?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
anything
to
show
that
the
agents
knew
that
back
before
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
this
gentleman
known
generally
in
the
business
as
blackie?
the
record
doesn't
show
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
doesn't
show
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
doolittle,
are
there
any
published
figures
as
to
the
number
of
narcotic
arrests
compared
--
with
the
warrant
as
against
to
those
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
put
a
question
to
you
on
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
probable
cause
again?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
agent
had
gone,
this
relates
to
the
arrest
of
wong
sun,
supposing
the
agent
had
gone
to
a
commissioner
with
an
affidavit
that
set
forth
the
string
of
events,
what
would
be
your
view
as
to
whether
the
warrant
should
have
issued?
