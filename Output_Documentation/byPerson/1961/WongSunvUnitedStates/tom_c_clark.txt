tom
c.
clark
the
agent
was
chinese,
wasn't
he?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
that
knowing
he
had
the
right
man
and
knowing
he's
at
the
right
laundry
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
does
the
record
shows
that
he
went
to
any
other
laundry?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
day
of
the
week
was
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
thought
it
was
when
he
flee?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
though
it
was
when
he
flee,
it's
when
he
went
after
him?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'd
like
to
ask
you,
if
we
go
back
in
a
moment,
do
you
mind?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
it
just
one
facet
or
is
that
the
total
ground?
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
told
then
that
he
thought
he
was
toy.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
your
contention
that
the
--
he
told
him
that
he'd
bought
it
from
blackie
toy
and
he
had
no
right
to
go
to
toy's
place?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
wonder
if,
under
your
contention,
maybe
summon
could've
been
issued
then.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
understood
you
to
say
that,
at
5:30,
hom
way
--
is
that
hom
way?
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
who
made
a
statement
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
that
they
looked
through
all
the
laundry
shops
at
six
o'clock.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
just
an
hour,
i
think.
justice
tom
c.
clark
toy
was
arrested
at
6:30?
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course,
the
door
was
never
opened.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
thought
they
use
it
as
a
lead.
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
narcotics
agents
have
any
--have
any
statutory
power
of
arrest
under
these?
justice
tom
c.
clark
suppose
he
had
taken
way,
with
the
information
that
(inaudible)
with
this
agent,
would
that
be
sufficient
information?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
why
it's
whether
or
not
the
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
then,
what
are
these?
