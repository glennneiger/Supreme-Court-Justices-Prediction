justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that's
basically
what
you
rely
on.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
--
did
hom
way
give
them
address,
post
address?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
agent
wong
a
chinese?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
conversation
with
toy
was
an
english,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
mr.
williams
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
suggest
on
--
on
friday
with
there
was
something
about
that
conversation
to
indicate
that
toy
might
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
it
does
not
affirmatively
appear
either
from
toy
or
from
agent
wong
whether
their
conversation
that
morning
was
in
english
or
in
chinese.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
one
of
the
point
mr.
williams
makes
that
at
this
time
there
has
been
warrants
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what's
the
--
what's
the
chronology
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
when
the
warrant
was
issued,
were
they
actually
in
custody?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
you
were
saying
was
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
that
to
suggest
that
the
proceedings
before
the
--
there's
only
one
proceeding
and
that
involve
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
only
--
only
thing
i'm
trying
to
get
clear
is
were
they
in
fact
under
arrest
and
detain
at
the
time
the
warrant
issued?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
any
of
that,
is
it
your
position
that
the
confessions
admission
to
which
objection
is
taken
were
given
after
they
had
been
released
on
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
williams
as
i
gather,
(inaudible)
see
that
there
is
an
exception
in
respect
of
a
confession
given
after
release
from
an
unlawful
detention.
and
is
it
your
position
that
this
fits
in
the
exception
that
mr.
williams
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
weapons?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
substantive
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
prior
to
the
conviction
as
i
understand,
you
once
said
before,
was
that
in
respect
of
the
grams,
you
say,
of
heroin
found
in
yee's
bedroom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
make
any
point
of
(inaudible)
in
relation
to
the
narcotics
agent
entry,
carrying
on
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
about
'the
authority'?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
after
that,
was
it
not
--
that
he
identified
himself,
was
it
not?
that's
he's
investigating,
he's
a
narcotics
agent
or
is
that
the
way
he
just
asked
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
the
record
show
after
the
(inaudible)
did
he
had
any
opportunity
to
say
why
he
was
there?
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
door
was
really
slammed
in
yee's
place.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
believe
the
actual
statement
he
made
at
that
time,
however,
standing
alone
was
exculpatory
not
inculpatory,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
led
to
a
chain
of
things.it
then
it
led
to
the
search
of
these
premises
and
the
subsequent
statements,
i
gather,
that
those
some
--
both
these
petitioners
ultimately
made.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
--
you
have
to
stand
or
fall
on
its
admini
--
inadmissibility
if
you
know
of
other
things,
which
followed
in
its
wake,
were
also
to
be
inadmissible,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see
--
that
is
evidence,
“i
saw
them
there
last
night
that
that
wouldn't
involve
participation
by
the
speaker
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
a
crime.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
that,
standing
alone,
have
been
evidence
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
before
the
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
because
that
difference
from
nueslein,
isn't
there?
there's
that
difference
between
the
statement
--
the
nueslein
statement,
as
i
remember,
that
was
a
collision
of
a
taxicab
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
question
that
the
statement
there
taken
was
in
effect
the
confession
of
drunk
and
driving,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
given
then
--
gave
him
a
drunk
and
dri
--
drunkenness
test
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
wait
a
minute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
doolittle?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
difference
between
you
and
mr.
williams
as
to
what
mr.
williams
said
that
the
question
wong
said,
“i
want
my
laundry”
only
after
toy
had
opened
the
door.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
it
is
a
rather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
how
was
toy
supposed
to
hear
him
through
the
closed
door?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
he
did
hold
up
a
laundry
ticket,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
saying
mr.
doolittle,
i
think
mr.
williams
suggested
that
when
he
said,
“i
saw
it
there
last
night”,
he
said
something
which
might
be
incriminatory
of
himself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
he
say
substantially
that,
“i
saw
it
there
last
night”
or
whatever
it
was,
that's
the
way
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
course
of
where
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
just
a
minute,
at
63,
what
--
is
this
which
tell
us
as
the
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
asked
him
how
much
stuff
johnny
had
and
he
said
he
had
about
a
piece
that
johnny
had
a
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
substantially
the
same
thing?
if
there
is
anything
incriminatory
about,
“i
saw
some
last
night”,
is
there's
also
something
incriminatory
about
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
say,
mr.
doolittle,
this
has
the
reference
i
gather
to
that
which
was
taken
from
yee,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
these
petitioners'
possession
of
that
particular
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
all
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
all
of
--
everything
you've
mentioned
so
far
has
been
something
that
a
petitioner
stated
as
that
his
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
about
the
government's
argument
on
--
what
they
discovered
at
yee's
house
was
something
less
than
an
ounce
and
that
(inaudible)
now,
that's
what
was
in
his
statements
about
it,
they
find
in
yee's
house
a
piece
(inaudible)
to
smoke,
well,
why
was
it
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wasn't
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
--
wasn't
the
statements
that
(inaudible)
is
the
last
piece
that
was
delivered
to
johnny
yee
the
night
before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
