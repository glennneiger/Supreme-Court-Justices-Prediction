may
it
please
the
court.
the
clerk
has
informed
us
of
the
time
of
situation
and
both
attorneys
are
agreeable
to
divide
the
--
the
remaining
45
minutes
or
whatever
it
may
(voice

--
mr.
jay
e.
darlington
the
--
i
am
here
mainly
to
serve
the
court
and
to
answer
any
questions
with
no
set
--
a
stereotyped
speech
to
make
but
if
it's
agreeable
i
would
like
to
state
what
were
appealing
from
what
i
think
the
question
is
and
briefly
the
facts
as
to
how
the
question
arises
and
what
i
feel
is
the
applicable
law
that
the
petitioner
was
the
plaintiff
in
a
personal
injury
case
in
the
district
court
based
upon
diversity.
i
was
his
attorney
there.
it
was
--
and
the
district
court
in
the
fall
of
1960
dismissed
the
case
in
my
absence
on
a
court
sought
motion
without
any
motion
for
dismissal
by
opposing
counsel
and
the
dismissal
was
not
purportedly
based
upon
rule
41
(b)
of
civil
--
of
civil
procedure
or
upon
any
local
rule.
but
upon
--
and
asserted
inherent
power
so-called
of
the
district
court
to
make
the
dismissal.
and
that
so-called
inherent
power
was
affirmed
on
appeal
by
a
two-to-three
decision.
the
facts
underlying
that
i
think
can
be
very
briefly
stated.
this
case
was
filed
in
1954.
in
the
spring
of
1955,
the
defense
counsel,
my
distinguished
opponents
erred
--
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
case
for
alleged
failure
of
the
complaint
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
and
in
the
fall
of
1955
after
six
months
consideration,
the
district
court
sustained
that
motion.
i
appealed
from
it
successfully
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
complaint
good
in
order
to
do
--
reinstate
it.
that
meant
--
and
instantly
by
opponent's
petition
for
certiorari
which
took
some
more
time
and
was
denied.
so
they
mandate
that
back
to
the
district
court
in
the
spring
of
1955
but
after
a
delay
of
a
couple
of
years
caused
by
the
defense.
following
that
in
the
summer
of
1957,
there
was
a
trial
setting.
i
moved
too
far
and
obtained
a
continuance;
the
general
continuance
with
the
consent
of
my
opponent.
in
the
summer
of
1959,
the
situation
was
reversed,
it
was
against
that
for
trial
and
my
opponent
moved
for
continuance
to
which
i
consented.
then
in
the
spring
of
1960,
my
opponent
filed
some
additional
interrogatories
which
i
answered.
and
the
next
step
in
the
case
was
that
late
in
september
of
1960,
the
district
court,
acting
under
the
--
this
local
rule
12
on
pretrial
which
simply
says
that
the
court
may
hold
pretrial
conference
upon
notice
to
the
attorney
of
the
case.
it's
really
a
short
restatement
of
rule
16
of
civil
procedure
adds
nothing
to
it.
that
notice,
a
mimeograph
form
of
notice,
went
out
to
both
counsel,
i
received
it.
it
was
set
for
a
1
p.m.
on
october
12,
columbus
day,
fell
on
a
wednesday.
beginning
monday
morning,
i
was
engaged
as
the
record
shows,
in
preparing
urgent
papers
of
an
undescribed
nature
to
be
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
--
i
was
--
at
indianapolis,
a
160
miles
distance
from
the
seat
of
this
district
court.
and
the
record
shows
that
my
opponent
conceded
that
--
that
on
tuesday
the
11th,
i
called
him
on
the
telephone,
told
him
what
i
was
doing
and
that
i
thought
i
could
make
that
pretrial
conference
the
next
afternoon
and
i
expected
to
be
there.
it
turned
out
wednesday
forenoon
that
i
couldn't
make
it.
i
--
like
some
lawyers
maybe
i
was
(inaudible)
i
had
--
unable
to
finish
this
job,
these
papers
that
we're
committed
to
the
supreme
court
of
--
at
indianapolis.
and
while
they're
not
described,
i
think
it
can
be
assumed
that
--
that
i
was
acting
in
good
faith
in
completing
that
job
but
there's
no
affidavit,
no
showing
to
the
contrary.
at
any
rate,
the
--
the
record
shows
that
on
that
forenoon;
that
wednesday
forenoon,
i
called
the
judge
of
the
district
court,
and
being
able
to
reach
and
talk
to
his
secretary,
i
told
her
that
i
was
still
working
on
papers
for
the
supreme
court.
i
couldn't
get
there
that
afternoon.
i
would
be
there
the
next
afternoon,
24
hours
later
or
the
day
after
that
or
any
day
that
was
convenient
for
the
court
or
counsel.
mr.
jay
e.
darlington
the
next
--
mr.
jay
e.
darlington
(voice

--
mr.
jay
e.
darlington
what's
that?
mr.
jay
e.
darlington
if
your
honor
please,
the
--
the
--
the
pretrial
hearing
was
set
for
1
p.m.
on
wednesday
afternoon.
mr.
jay
e.
darlington
i
telephoned
--
the
record
shows
i
telephoned
the
secretary
about
at
10:45
a.m.
or
--
or
thereabouts
and
asked
to
speak
to
the
judge
but
he
was
on
the
bench.
i
talked
to
her,
asked
her
to
please
inform
the
court
also
to
inform
opposing
counsel.
i
told
her
for
i
thought
the
--
he
was,
and
she
did
that;
she
performed
that
task,
affirmed
it
before
noon.
so
--
so
by
noon
of
wednesday,
the
message
had
reached
his
honor
and
had
reached
my
opposing
counsel
by
the
--
well
--
mr.
jay
e.
darlington
what's
it?
mr.
jay
e.
darlington
oh,
yes.
yes
your
honor
and
the
--
was
not
going
--
i
didn't
think
it
was
appropriate
to
go
into
detail
with
the
secretary
as
to
the
nature
or
the
necessity
of
the
work
i
was
doing.
i
told
her
i
was
preparing
for
the
papers
for
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
indiana.
actually
they
were
committed
to
be
filed
that
day
but
i
didn't
go
into
that.
that
at
any
rate,
that
afternoon
after
waiting
for
sometime,
the
--
before,
i
--
i
don't
know
why
because
it
was
known
i
couldn't
be
there
but
anyway,
at
3
p.m.
that
the
matter
was
called
for
pretrial
conference
and
a
pretrial
conference
was
held
ex
parte
the
--
between
the
district
judge
and
my
opponent
that
at
which
my
opponent
said,
"yes,
i
had
called
him
the
day
before",
and
said,
"i
thought
i
could
make
it,
i
expect
you
to
be
there",
and
the
--
the
secretary
was
called
in
and
related
substantially
of
what
i
have
stated.
and
then
his
honor
said
to
my
opposing
counsel
that
--
that
--
if
i
may
read
one
short
paragraph,
"under
the
circumstances,
what
is
your
thinking
mr.
bodle?"
there
was
no
motion
then
by
my
opponent
or
at
any
time
during
that
hearing,
written
or
oral
to
dismiss
this
case.
mr.
bodle
announced
this
legal
doctrine
to
the
court
which
was
adopted
by
the
district
court,
substantially
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
yet
the
question
here
is
substantial
whether
the
doctrine
is
right
or
not,
whether
its
dangerous
or
not.
rest
of
it
is
at
the
bottom
page
13
of
the
transcript.
"mr.
bodle,
i
would
certainly
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
has
an
inherent
authority
to
dismiss
cases
not
only
under
its
own
local
rule
concerning
prosecution
but
it
has
an
inherent
power
without
any
specific
rule
by
virtue
of
federal
rule
83
and
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
dismiss
where
the
court
fix
if
necessary
under
the
particular
situations
not
provided
for
by
any
specific
local
rule."
well
the
--
after
some
discussion
about
the
--
my
being
to
blame
for
not
being
there
which
is
not
important.
i
don't
consider
i'm
one
the
trial
particularly
except
to
say
that
i
never
have
conceded
below
that
--
that
if
i
did
any
wrong.
i
don't
think
i
did
--
i
think
that
i
did
my
best
but
that's
not
the
point.
the
proceeding
ended
with
this
statement;
this
directive
of
the
district
court.
the
court
now
directs
the
clerk
to
enter
in
order
to
this
effect
pursuant
to
the
inherent
--
this
is
page
68,
pursuant
to
the
inherent
powers
of
the
court
and
upon
failure
of
plaintiff's
counsel
to
appear
at
pretrial
which
was
scheduled
for
the
day
and
so
on,
pursuant
to
notice
under
rule
of
12.
counsel
having
failed
to
give
any
good
and
sufficient
reason
for
not
appearing
at
that
pretrial,
the
cause
is
now
dismissed.
and
we
go
over
to
the
majority
opinion
at
page
21
and
we
find
the
paragraph
which
i
think
is
embedded
in
a
little
confused
argument
in
the
opinion
if
i
may
say
so,
but
the
crux
of
it
is
there
at
the
bottom
of
page
21.
if
i
may
i
read
it,
"the
plaintiff
argues
that
there
was
no
motion
by
defendant
for
a
dismissal
since
the
trial
court
did
not
base
its
dismissal
on
local
rule
11
or
on
rule
41
(b)
of
federal
rules
civil
procedure
for
want
of
prosecution.
no
such
motion
was
required."
it
is
quite
clear
to
us
that
the
district
courts
have
ample
authority
to
regulate
their
practice
in
any
manner
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
rules
so
on
as
provided
in
rule
83.
this
case
comes
within
the
purview
of
that
rule.
the
court
then
goes
on
to
say
that
my
argument
to
the
contrary
as
to
sheer
sophistry
to
--
and
that
the
trial
court
has
inherent
power
to
do
what?
to
enforce
its
rules,
orders
or
procedures.
i
call
attention
to
procedures;
it's
a
pretty
broad
loose
term
and
to
impose
appropriate
sanctions
for
failure
to
comply.
the
authorities
are
all
against
me
the
court
says.
judge
schnackenberg
dissented.
he
points
out
that
the
dismissal
was
not
based
upon
want
of
prosecution
that
as
indeed
the
majority
opinion
had
said,
"if
it
has
been
the
defendant
wouldn't
have
been
in
the
very
good
position
because
the
defendant
had
caused
two
years
of
delay
in
the
case,
much
expense
to
my
client
and
myself
by
causing
that
unnecessary
appeal
to
get
back
in
court
again."
and
at
the
last
time
the
case
was
set
for
trial.
it
was
postponed
generally
at
his
request
to
which
i
consented.
i
had
offered
and
conveyed
to
the
judge
my
desire
to
be
there
the
next
afternoon
24
hours
later.
now
the
--
that
raises
questions
which
depend
not
on
any
federal
statute.
it
does
involve
the
fifth
amendment
if
this
court
cares
to
invoke
it
because
if
my
accusation
is
going
to
be
correct,
i
think
the
plaintiff
has
been
deprived
of
his
property
that
is
his
cause
of
action
without
the
presence
of
law.
i
think
the
court
has
the
option
to
reverse
on
that
ground
if
it
thinks
the
case
shouldn't
be
reversed.
i
think
the
court
likewise
has
the
option
to
bypass
the
constitutional
question
and
decided
on
an
interpretation
of
the
rules.
at
least
the
division
of
power
between
the
courts
and
the
extent
to
which
district
courts
can
go
unrestricted
by
anything
definite
either
in
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
or
anything
in
their
own
rules
just
for
their
inherent
power
on
the
spur
of
the
moment.
as
counsel
announced
to
the
court
and
this
was
upheld.
our
contention
is
that
the
--
that
is
a
dangerous
doctrine
that
if
allowed
to
persist
and
it
will
persist
as
a
precedent
that
unless
reversed
here
that
it
would
make
the
--
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
--
a
hollow
shelf
that
no
lawyer
could
rely
on.
the
same
would
be
true
of
the
local
rules.
you
couldn't
even
rely
on
the
local
rules.
you'll
find
in
my
brief,
i
quoted
that
on
--
the
court's
own
local
rule
7th
which
says
on
page
6
of
the
brief,
"motions
to
dismiss
for
summary
judgment
for
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings
shall
be
accompanied
by
a
brief
and
adverse
party
shall
have
15
days
to
file
an
answer
and
so
on."
in
that
respect,
the
protection
that
was
given
to
me
and
other
parties
by
that
local
rule,
it's
greater
than
is
spelled
out
on
rule
41
(b)
did.
now
the
--
i
have
studied
my
opponent's
cases
as
well
as
i
can
and
particularly
the
two
decisions
of
this
court
that
he
refers
to
in
the
text
(inaudible)
moore's
that
he
refers
to
and
the
other
cases.
incidentally,
mr.
moore's
text
is
based
--
cites
only
the
wisdom
case.
the
district
court
case
in
alabama
where
the
--
the
dismissal
was
under
rule
41
(b)
and
the
defendant
had
made
a
motion
for
dismissal.
now,
in
that
case
as
in
many
others
which
counsel
cites,
there
are
some
dicta,
there's
some
loose
language
about
the
inherent
powers
of
courts
to
dismiss
cases
and
to
apply
sanctions.
and
i
don't
deny
the
sanctions
but
how
about
dismissal,
how
about
final
disposal,
final
judgement
that
had
some
serious
matter
that
(inaudible)
--
there
is
not
a
single
solid
holding
that
i
know
of
by
this
court
or
certainly
not
by
this
court
or
by
any
other
court
except
the
dicta
that
i
have
mentioned
which
is
--
supports
this
doctrine.
and
if
there
were
below,
it
certainly
wouldn't
bind
this
court.
that's
what
this
court
seats
for.
and
i
haven't
time
to
elaborate.
i
don't
need
to
elaborate.
just
please
consider
the
--
what
shape
the
practice
is
going
to
be
in
and
all
of
the
confusion
like
of
uniformity,
all
the
aggrieved
parties
coming
up
here
for
relief
the
same
as
i
am
that
should
the
procedure
be
tightened
up,
should
that
--
or
should
it
be
left
the
way
this
precedent
leaves
it.
