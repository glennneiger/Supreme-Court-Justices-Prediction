justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
do
i
understand
--
how
long
--
how
much
of
a
notice
are
you
setting
on
that
day
of
the
pretrial
that
each
of
you
had?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
this
setting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
date
of
the
pretrial
was
what
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
october
12?
so
that's
about
10-12
days
notice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
do
i
understand
that
the
--
you
and
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
had
a
conversation
on
the
afternoon
of
the
11th?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
many
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
conversation
was
if
he
would
not
produce
the
plaintiff
for
the
deposition
but
that
he
would
be
at
the
pretrial
the
following
day?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
when
did
you
first
learn
that
he
would
not
attend
the
pretrial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
did
not
hear
it
directly
from
mr.
darlington?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
just
went
to
the
pretrial
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
when
was
the
pretrial
notice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
that
--
that
was
nothing,
i
take
it
in
which
either
of
you
had
any
part
that
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
--
whatever
the
processes
are
in
the
clerk's
office.
the
clerk's
office
sent
out
the
notice
of
pretrial,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
dismissal
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
not
the
last
they
intended,
maybe
the
last
thing
that
happened.
but
after
your
consent
to
the
continuance,
your
adversary
sent
the
continuance.
then
there
was
action
by
the
court
for
notice
of
pretrial,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
aren't
you
really
suggesting
that
he
was
holding
it
over
your
head
in
hopes
that
the
railroad
would
pay
substantive
settlement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
under
the
federal
rules,
if
you
have
followed
the
motion
route
on
his
none
appearance,
would
there
have
been
any
requirement
under
the
rule
that
you
served
a
notice
of
motion
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
i'm
getting
at
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
you
know
that
you
had
a
motion
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
did
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
not
file
but
had
you
filed
it
and
judge
swygert
chose
to
proceed
under
it,
there
could
not
have
been
any
action
of
dismissal
that
day,
there
would've
had
to
be
a
service
of
the
motion
on
your
adversary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
incidentally,
was
--
was
there
a
motion
before
judge
swygert
to
set
aside
the
order
of
dismissal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
60
(b)
motion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
it
the
court
said
in
the
situation
--
cover
this
situation
in
their
rules.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
the
rules
of
this
district
court
do
not
well
provide.
