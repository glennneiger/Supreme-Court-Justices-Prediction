mr.
john
bodle
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
although
not
in
oral
argument
today
has
asserted
that
there
is
no
power
in
the
federal
district
courts
to
dismiss
actions
of
their
own
volition
for
disobedience
of
court
orders
or
court
settings
or
court
rules.
this
is
not
the
case.
the
rule
of
law
is
well
established
to
the
contrary.
we
have
the
cases
or
some
of
the
more
recent
cases
outlined
in
our
brief
at
pages
11
through
14.
and
it's
simply
indisputable.
this
court
has
recognized
in
passing
that
the
trial
courts
still
has
sua
sponte
powers
to
enforce
sanctions
including
dismissal
of
their
own
motion.
the
federal
rules
have
certainly
not
removed
those
powers
and
federal
rule
83,
the
situation,
the
rule
which
allows
the
court
to
govern
itself
in
unusual
situations
where
there
is
no
standing
rule
is
applicable
here.
and
of
course
rule
41
(b)
which
talks
about
motions
by
defendants
for
dismissals
also
contains
within
itself
a
reference
to
other
dismissals
not
provided
for
herein.
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
would
have
the
courts
strike
down
these
long-recognized
and
frequently
exercised
powers.
there
is
nothing
new
or
nothing
noble
on
what
was
done
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case.
on
behalf
of
the
respondents,
we
submit
that
the
preservation
of
this
powers
of
trial
court
is
necessary
to
the
efficient
operation
of
the
courts
in
the
scheduling
of
their
procedures
and
their
settings
that
their
application
in
this
case
was
justified
by
the
facts
which
i'll
consider
in
a
moment.
and
that
this
court
accordingly
should
affirm
the
dismissal
which
was
granted
below
and
which
was
approved
by
the
seventh
circuit.
there's
no
constitutional
question
here
since
the
basic
power
to
act
in
the
manner
in
which
the
trial
court
did
act
is
well
established
by
the
cases.
the
only
possible
question
is
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
trial
court,
was
it
within
its
discretion
to
grant
the
dismissal
sua
sponte
as
it
did
on
--
and
was
entitled
to
do
so
under
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case.
now,
of
course
any
case
involving
exercise
of
discretion
will
stand
and
fall
on
its
own
facts.
nevertheless,
we
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
our
brief
clearly
recognizing
the
propriety
of
dismissing
actions
sua
sponte
for
disregard
of
pretrial
settings.
i'll
now
refer
to
those
cases
in
a
moment.
we
submit
that
to
affirm
the
result
below
will
be
to
follow
the
existing
state
of
the
law
and
will
not
be
part
from
more
effect,
the
present
state
of
the
law
in
any
regard.
but
then
on
the
other
hand,
a
reversal
would
have
serious
consequences
and
that
it
would
impinge
upon
the
powers
of
the
trial
courts
to
regulate
their
business
which
would
be
most
unfortunate
view
of
the
continuing
congestion
problem
in
our
courts.
turning
to
the
facts,
i'd
like
to
reexamine
very
briefly.
we
have
for
purposes
of
this
case
and
action
that
was
filed
in
march
of
1957
since
that's
when
the
court
--
the
trial
court
got
the
case
back
on
remand.
now
at
no
time
since
march
1957
and
indeed
at
no
time
prior
to
the
first
appeal
did
the
plaintiff
ever
make
any
move
to
carry
this
case
forward
by
the
smallest
step.
there
was
never
a
request
for
a
setting.
there
were
never
any
interrogatories
spelled.
there
was
never
any
action
taken
by
the
plaintiff
on
the
record
in
this
case
to
move
the
case
along.
now
two
years
after
the
remand
in
the
spring
of
1959,
and
this
is
the
point
which
my
opponent
omits
from
his
brief
and
from
his
argument
today.
the
trial
court
brought
the
matter
up
of
its
own
volition
for
possible
dismissal
for
failure
to
prosecute
under
its
one
rule,
under
the
20-year
rule.
after
keeping
that
matter
under
advisement
for
a
couple
of
months,
the
court
did
decide
to
leave
the
case
on
the
docket
which
i
certainly
think
and
submit
to
the
court
shows
that
the
trial
judge
was
not
dead-set
against
this
case
and
was
not
determined
to
get
rid
of
the
case.
there
have
been
absolutely
no
activity
for
two
years
and
still
he
let
us
stay
on
the
docket.
now
another
year
and
four
months
went
by
and
still
there
was
no
action
whatsoever
by
the
plaintiff.
finally,
in
october
of
1960
or
actually
at
the
end
of
september
1960,
the
trial
court
sent
out
notices
of
the
pretrial.
this
was
done
pursuant
to
a
valid
local
rule
based
upon
federal
rule
16
and
accordingly,
as
this
court
said
many
years
ago
in
weil
versus
neary
having
any
force
and
effect
of
law.
nothing
happened
and
until
about
two
hours
before
the
pretrial
when
this
telephone
call
came
from
indianapolis.
plaintiff's
counsel
talking
to
the
secretary
said
in
the
fact
that
he
was
staying
on
in
indianapolis
to
take
care
of
some
other
unspecified
business
and
an
unrelated
manner
--
matter.
now
it's
obvious
i
submit
that
on
these
facts,
petitioner's
counsel
was
not
the
innocent
victim
of
some
unforeseen
circumstance
created
by
someone
else
which
prevented
his
attendance.
that
is
an
imaginative
version
but
it
will
not
fit
within
the
framework.
we
--
all
of
us
have
many
different
cases
to
work
on
but
we
--
all
of
us,
as
officers
of
the
court
or
allegiance
to
the
court
and
to
its
trial
settings.
the
trial
courts
and
not
trial
counsel
are
in
charge
of
the
trial
dockets
and
trial
schedules.
there's
no
contention
here
by
the
petitioner
that
the
court
was
obligated
to
grant
its
continuance.
and
of
course
only
the
trial
court
knew
when
its
affairs
would
again
permit
the
matter
to
be
brought
on
for
pretrial.
the
petitioner's
counsel
is
not
entitled
to
bargain
with
the
court
by
telephone
to
say,
"well
i
--
i
just
can't
make
it
today,
i've
got
something
more
important
on.
now,
i'll
just
show
up
in
the
next
day
or
two
and
we
can
take
care
of
it
then.
mr.
john
bodle
counsel
for
defendant,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
bodle
i
was
that
counsel.
i
was
present
at
the
time
the
dismissal
was
entered.
mr.
john
bodle
yes
sir,
i
believe
the
portions
that
mr.
darlington
read
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
showed
that.
mr.
john
bodle
well,
that's
true.
mr.
john
bodle
it
was
dismissed
by
the
court
of
his
own
motion.
mr.
john
bodle
he
called
me
on
the
telephone.
you
see,
as
also
appears
in
the
record.
i
had
noticed
the
deposition
of
his
plaintiff
and
the
reason
for
his
phone
call
and
i
think
this
was
in
the
record,
i
wouldn't
say
it,
is
that
he
was
calling
to
tell
me
that
he
wasn't
going
to
produce
his
plaintiff
and
he
wasn't
going
to
be
there
at
the
deposition
but
that
he
didn't
tell
me
to
go
to
the
pretrial.
mr.
john
bodle
your
honor,
the
fact
is
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
that
is
that
i
had
a
motion
and
i
never
had
the
reason
or
the
opportunity
to
present
because
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
it
felt
there
been
on
the
front
to
its
processes
after
this
long
delay
by
the
plaintiff
showing
complete
indifference
to
his
cause
of
action.
and
the
--
the
court
moved
forward
of
its
own
motion.
so,
there's
no
need
for
me
to
present
a
37
(d)
motion.
mr.
john
bodle
well,
you
mean
the
darlington
versus
studebaker-packard
case?
no
your
honor,
that's
judge
robert
grant.
this
is
not
the
same
judge.
mr.
john
bodle
this
is
judge
swygert
who
is
now
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
seventh
circuit.
mr.
john
bodle
well,
it
was
the
day
before
the
pretrial.
mr.
john
bodle
the
judge
was
seating
in
hammond
mr.
justice
clark.
it's
approximately
160
or
165
miles
away.
mr.
john
bodle
the
notice
was
sent
out
as
the
record
shows
on
september
30th
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
and
was
timely
received
through
the
mails.
mr.
john
bodle
october
12th.
mr.
john
bodle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
bodle
afternoon
or
evening
of
the
11th,
i
have
forgotten
when
it
was,
the
record
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
may
show.
mr.
john
bodle
that
was
the
gist
of
the
conversation.
mr.
john
bodle
when
i
was
in
the
gary,
at
the
office
of
the
attorneys
where
the
deposition
of
the
plaintiff
was
to
have
taken
place.
i
received
a
phone
call
from
the
judge's
secretary
subsequent
to
the
time
that
she
had
had
this
telephone
call
from
mr.
darlington.
mr.
john
bodle
i
never
had
any
direct
correspondence
with
or
any
phone
calls
from
mr.
darlington
about
that
note
sir.
mr.
john
bodle
i
went
to
the
pretrial
at
the
notice
of
time.
mr.
darlington
was
not
there
and
the
court
informed
me
again
of
what
had
happened
and
said,
"let's
wait
a
while
and
see
whether
he
comes",
and
of
course
he
did
not.
mr.
john
bodle
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
record
does
not
show
any
such
efforts
your
honor.
and
i
would
like
to
reply
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
need
to
do
that
because
of
two
things.
first
of
all,
we're
all
acquainted
with
the
(inaudible)
clause
of
agency
and
of
attorney
and
client
and
in
--
and
that
the
inaction
of
attorney
is
attributable
to
his
client.
but
secondly,
i
think
that
application
of
that
rule
is
entirely
just
in
this
case
because
if
--
a
perfectly
reasonable
inference
from
the
long
delay
and
long
inaction,
the
plaintiff
never
once
tried
and
move
his
case
ahead
and
if
he
treasured
the
case
and
thought
it
was
valid
and
valuable
i
think
he
would've
done
so
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
--
mr.
john
bodle
the
--
i
have
had
stated
them
just
generally
in
my
brief,
"the
automobile
driven
by
the
plaintiff
ran
into
the
side
of
a
train
of
the
wabash
railroad."
i
think
it
hit
about
53
cars
back
in
the
engine
or
some
such
figure.
the
--
mr.
john
bodle
yes
sir.
mr.
john
bodle
oh
no,
this
is
a
--
mr.
john
bodle
just
a
railroad
crossing
case
your
honor.
mr.
justice
douglas
where
the
plaintiff
was
driving
a
car
down
the
road
and
didn't
stop
and
ran
into
the
train.
mr.
john
bodle
well,
i
have
sent
a
notice
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
john
bodle
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
bodle
yes,
it
had
you
honor.
this
is
not
the
first
effort
that
had
been
made
on
those
lines.
mr.
john
bodle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
bodle
no,
sir.
i
live
in
lafayette,
indiana.
i
travel
about
110
miles
to
hammond
for
the
pretrial.
mr.
john
bodle
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
cross
over
but
he's
already
mentioned
it,
let
me
go
back
to
it.
in
the
spring
of
1959,
the
trial
court
had
the
matter
of
--
of
its
own
volition
to
consider
dismissing
for
his
this
lack
of
diligence.
on
the
same
day
that
he
decided
to
keep
the
case
on
the
docket,
he
made
this
trial
setting.
mr.
john
bodle
he
made
the
trial
setting
at
that
same
time.
mr.
john
bodle
it
happened
to
be
a
very
bad
time.
the
record
does
not
show
it
but
of
course
in
asking
for
a
continuance,
we're
not
asking
that
never
be
reset
but
it
was
a
very
immediate
thing
for
us
in
a
very
bad
time
and
it
was
--
although
the
volition
came
from
us,
it
was
instantly
agreed
in
or
agreed
to
by
the
plaintiff.
and
then
they
--
mr.
john
bodle
it
was
made
at
my
or
not
mine
personally
but
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
on
our
side
of
the
case
and
consented
to
by
plaintiff.
mr.
john
bodle
well,
in
the
meantime
we
had
filed
some
additional
interrogatories
which
is
on
the
record
and
we've
done
some
other
the
things
that
don't
appear
in
the
record
but
the
last
action
on
the
record
where
the
interrogatories
which
we
filed
to
update
the
information
we
got
by
our
original
set
of
interrogatories
some
years
early.
mr.
john
bodle
pretrial
was
noticed
september
30th,
1960.
mr.
john
bodle
this
was
done
by
the
court.
mr.
john
bodle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
bodle
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
judge
makes
up
his
pretrial
docket
as
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
the
court
sent
out
the
notice.
mr.
john
bodle
yes,
sir.
that
--
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
john
bodle
well
no,
he
didn't
ask
for
the
last
continuance.
mr.
john
bodle
yes.
mr.
john
bodle
well,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
it
doesn't
matter
--
mr.
john
bodle
striking
a
defense
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
entering
a
default
judgment,
this
would've
been
perfectly
within
the
powers
of
the
court.
mr.
john
bodle
and
--
mr.
john
bodle
no,
sir.
you
then
must
look
at
the
surrounding
circumstances
and
the
fact
that
although
the
court
had
allowed
the
case
after
a
two
year
delay
to
stay
on
the
docket.
plaintiff
had
done
nothing
further
and
had
evidence
to
complete,
disregard
for
his
claim.
and
i
submit
that
the
lack
of
importance
which
plaintiff's
counsel
attached
to
it
was
merely
a
reflection
of
the
plaintiff's
own
attitude
because
trial
orders
as
we
know
as
a
practical
matter
you
don't
and
you
can't
let
a
case
drag
that
way
if
your
client
is
interested
and
it
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
just
doesn't
happen.
mr.
john
bodle
he
would
have
that
power
your
honor
if
he
wanted
to
adopt
theory
of
contempt.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
might
be
somewhat
harsh
on
the
counsel
when
you
consider
that
what
he
was
doing
here
probably
merely
reflected
the
fact
of
plaintiff's
personal
lack
of
great
interest
in
the
case
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
as
shown
by
this
long
delay.
mr.
john
bodle
this
is
--
mr.
john
bodle
this
is
found
only
--
i
suggest
to
the
court
by
the
fact
that
he
had
never
taken
the
least
initiative
to
attempt
to
move
the
case
forward.
mr.
john
bodle
yes
your
honor
that's
exactly
what
i'm
suggesting.
mr.
john
bodle
the
district
court
has
a
one
year
rule
permitting
dismissal
where
a
case
has
been
inactive
for
that
amount
of
time.
incidentally,
of
course
that's
only
one
type
of
lack
of
prosecution,
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
border
or
a
setting
is
a
pacific
type
of
failure
to
prosecute
which
we
had
involved
here.
mr.
john
bodle
a
motion
which
originates
with
the
defendant,
of
course
i
would've
had
to
file
a
motion
and
notice
of
that
would've
gone
to
the
party.
but
here
where
the
trial
court
moves
sua
sponte
it
has
already
exercised
its
discretion
and
it
knew
from
the
telephone
conversation
of
counsel
of
the
secretary
where
he
alleged
the
facts
to
be
and
the
door
of
the
trial
court
was
opened
under
the
rule
60
(b).
if
the
counsel
for
petitioner
felt
that
he
had
not
explained
all
the
facts
and
that
he
had
meritorious
facts
to
present
that
would
have
made
the
trial
court
exercise
its
discretion
in
the
opposite
manner
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
he
could've
--
mr.
john
bodle
which
i
had
--
mr.
john
bodle
--
rushed
out
and
did
not
file.
mr.
john
bodle
that's
correct.
that's
right
mr.
justice
brennan.
by
the
same
talking,
the
courts
often
have
power
to
make
a
decision
and
then
a
notice
period
is
granted
and
of
additional
facts
are
desired
to
be
presented.
they
are
presented
as
in
a
case
where
a
third
party
complaint
is
filed
or
counterclaim
is
filed.
the
party
can
be
heard
and
the
action
set
aside.
this
is
the
whole
purpose
of
rule
60
(b).
mr.
john
bodle
no,
your
honor
and
this
is
the
last
point
i
want
to
make.
i
think
this
is
of
greatest
significance
because
if
there
had
been
any
facts
which
the
counsel
wanted
to
bring
before
the
trial
court
to
try
to
explain
exactly
what
is
undisclosed
alleged
work
in
another
city
was
and
he
never
filed
any
affidavit
or
anything
about
that.
he
could
have
and
we
submit
should
have
in
fairness
to
this
court
come
before
the
trial
court
and
said,
"now
here
are
my
facts.
i
want
a
complete
hearing."
he
had
the
right
to
ask
for
that
complete
hearing
and
he
failed
to
do
so.
mr.
john
bodle
now
he
didn't
--
mr.
john
bodle
this
would've
been
a
60
(b)
motion,
i
submit,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
had
he
done
that
then
there'd
be
no
worry
here
as
to
what
actually
happened
that
day
in
indianapolis.
now,
he
didn't
have
to
proceed
that
way,
i
don't
contend
for
that
for
the
moment
but
i
do
say
that
if
he
chooses
not
to
then
let
him
not
complain
that
he
had
no
opportunity
for
a
hearing
because
the
opportunity
was
there
and
he
elected
not
to
take
advantage
of
it.
there
had
been
many
cases
in
which
the
power
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
appear
at
a
pretrial
has
been
--
has
been
recognized
and
applied.
the
wisdom
versus
texas
case,
(inaudible)
versus
eastern
airlines
where
apparently
very
serious
personal
injury
counter
claim
was
dismissed
for
that
sole
reason.
the
case
of
the
(voice
overlap)
awaits
--
mr.
john
bodle
some
of
district
courts
which
may
have
had
more
frequent
trouble
with
this
have
passed
pretrial
rules
which
specifically
state
dismissal
may
follow
forthwith.
mr.
john
bodle
the
rules
of
this
--
this
district
court
where
i
don't
think
this
type
of
disobedience
or
disregard
has
been
a
matter
of
concern.
had
never
had
occasion
to
enact
any
such
rule.
and
that
is
why
of
course
federal
rule
83
permitting
the
court
leeway
to
act
in
unusual
situations
not
provided
for
in
the
rule
is
so
important.
