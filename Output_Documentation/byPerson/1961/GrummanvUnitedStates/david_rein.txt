mr.
david
rein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
here
was
indicted
for
refusing
to
answer
four
the
questions
put
to
him
by
a
subcommittee
of
the
committee
on
un-american
activities
on
july
18th,
1957.
prior
to
trial,
petitioner's
motion
to
dismiss
counts
1,
2
and
4
of
this
indictment
was
granted
and
therefore,
petitioner
went
to
trial
only
on
the
remaining
count,
count
3.
this
count,
i
would
like
to
read
it
briefly
from
brief
as
it
appears
at
page
4,
alleged
the
refusal
to
answer
the
following
question.
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
when
he,
mignon,
was
in
the
communist
party,
he
said,
"with
you”,
and
in
local
term,
he
said
that
he
sat
in
closed
communist
cell
meetings
with
you.
now,
i
will
ask
you
whether
or
not
he
was
telling
the
truth
or
was
he
telling
a
falsehood.
i
would
like
to
repeat
again
that
this
is
the
only
count
upon
which
petitioner
went
to
trial
and
on
which
he
was
convicted.
i
repeat
what
would
appear
to
be
obvious
and
repeat
it
again
because
this
point
seems
to
have
escaped
the
court
below
completely
which
thought
it
was
reviewing
apparently
a
conviction
on
the
counts
which
dismissed
and
i
don't
think
the
point
is
yet
permeated
to
the
government,
at
least
as
far
as
i
can
see
from
its
brief.
and
i
contend
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
we
only
have
this
count
before
the
court
for
review
and
these
contentions
really
are
we
--
web
into
one
another
that
this
count
3
question
was
not
pertinent
to
the
announced
subject
under
inquiry
that
the
petitioner
was
given
no
explanation
of
the
pertinency
of
that
count,
even
though
they
objected
to
the
pertinency
of
the
count
and
finally
related
to
these
other
points,
the
question
had
no
legitimate
legislative
purpose
and
that
there
was
no
sufficient
justification
for
the
invasion
of
petitioner's
privacy
in
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
david
rein
oh,
yes,
he
did.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
he
--
mr.
david
rein
--
he
made
a
pertinency
objection
by
saying,
"i
don't
think
that
the
question
is
pertinent".
that
appears,
and
if
your
honor
would
permit
me,
i
would
like
to
go
into
the
context,
the
full
context
of
the
case
and
i
will
get
to
that
point
and
read
the
exact
language
if
i
may
defer
that
for
a
minute.
now
first,
i
like
to
point
out
that
these
hearings
were
being
held
pursuant
to
a
formal
resolution
which
was
adopted
by
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities
committee
on
july
10th
of
1957.
and
we
have
here
what
we
do
not
normally
have
in
inquiries
by
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities
and
perhaps
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
watkins
case
because
these
hearings
were
held
shortly
after
it,
we
have
an
exact
frame
of
reference
as
to
what
was
that
the
committee
was
concerned
with.
i
have
set
out
for
easy
reference
in
my
brief
at
page
4
the
exact
language
of
that
resolution.
and
you
will
note
that
the
purpose
of
the
resolution
was
to
investigate
whether
or
not
members
of
the
communist
party
or
persons
subject
to
its
discipline
are
employed
in
various
media
of
communications
and
it
goes
on
with
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
we
need
remedial
legislation
at
the
present
time
to
combat
dangers
of
espionage
or
sabotage
in
the
communications
industry.
according
to
the
staff
director
of
the
committee,
mr.
arens,
who
testified
at
the
trial,
was
the
only
witness
of
the
trial,
petitioner
had
been
subpoenaed
as
a
witness
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
information
the
committee
had
obtained
from
a
mr.
michael
mignon.
mignon,
according
to
mr.
arens,
was
one
of
several
to
use
the
parlance
of
the
committee,
they
have
great
deal
of
parlance
which
is
peculiar
to
the
committee,
was
one
of
what
is
called
a
friendly
and
cooperative
witness.
mr.
david
rein
well,
that's
their
terminology.
i
don't
say
he's
sapient.
i
think
it
means
friendly
and
cooperative.
i
don't
think
there's
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
rein
well,
it's
peculiar
because
i
don't
know
that
they
have
a
classification.
some
witnesses
are
classified
as
friendly
and
cooperative
and
others
--
it's
not
peculiar
but
it's
peculiar
in
the
sense
that
they
used
this
as
their
regular
parlance.
i
don't
know
that
other
people
regularly
describe
witnesses
in
a
formal
classification,
some
being
friendly
and
cooperative
as
mignon
was
and
as
our
particular
petitioner
here
was
described
as
unfriendly
and
uncooperative.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct,
in
advance.
according
to
the
staff
director,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
witness
mignon,
prior
to
these
hearings
had
been
interviewed
in
several
times
by
the
staff.
and
it
was
only
after
that
he
was
fully
satisfied
that
he
was
a
reliable
witness,
one
who
which
they
would
have
full
confidence
that
they
decided
to
put
them
on
the
witness
stand.
now,
mignon
testified
on
the
first
day
of
the
hearing,
these
hearings
opened
up
on
july
17th.
he
testified
that
he
and
mignon
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
from
late
1936
to
sometime
in
1940
and
that
during
most
of
this
time,
he
had
also
been
an
officer
of
the
american
communications
association,
which
is
a
labor
union
in
this
communications
field.
and
during
the
course
of
his
testimony,
he
repeated
for
the
public
record
a
list
of
names
which
he
had
supplied
to
the
committee
in
executive
session
as
people
whom
he
had
known
as
communist
during
this
period
and
he
included
on
that
list
the
name
of
the
petitioner.
now,
the
petitioner
was
the
first
witness
to
go
onto
the
stand
on
the
following
day,
that
is
july
18th.
and
although
the
committee
had
never
had
any
contact
with
the
petitioner
before,
he
was
classified
in
this
pigeonhole
as
being
an
unfriendly
and
uncooperative
witness.
the
petitioner
relying
on
what
was
then
the
recent
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
watkins
and
sweezy,
i
believe
they
had
been
decided
maybe
six
weeks
before.
this
hearing
was
in
july
of
1957.
he
refused
to
answer
questions
as
to
whether
he
was
a
communist
or
knew
of
communist
in
the
communications
industry.
now,
the
staff
director
and
the
chairman
of
the
committee
both
pressed
petitioner
to
answer
to
these
questions,
to
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
he
was
now
a
communist.
and
they
went
at
some
length
to
explain
the
pertinency
of
that
particular
question.
and
i
think
it's
important
in
the
light
of
the
context
and
the
fact
that
we
have
a
different
question
before
us,
to
read
to
you
why
the
committee
said
it
wanted
an
answer
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
was
now
a
communist.
well,
i
like
to
read,
it's
set
out
briefly
at
my
brief
at
page
67
what
he
was
told
by
the
staff
director,
mr.
arens,
namely,
“mr.
grumman,
if
you
are
now
a
communist,
you
could
tell
this
committee
at
all
probability
of
directives
from
the
communist
party
to
communist
respecting
the
vital
communications
facilities
of
this
nation”
--
mr.
david
rein
6
to
7.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
sorry.
“if
you
are
now
a
communist,
you
could
tell
this
committee
of
the
techniques
proposed
by
the
communist
party
to
cease
the
communications
industry
to
intercept
messages
to
sabotage
communications
in
the
event
of
war”.
then
the
chairman
of
the
committee
added
the
following
note,
he
said,
he
wanted
to
bring
to
the
witnesses'
attention
the
then
recent
decision
of
judge
youngdahl,
district
judge
youngdahl
in
the
district
court
of
columbia
in
your
case
of
united
states
against
peck,
in
which
he
said
that
--
judge
youngdahl
there
he
said
that
the
communist
movement
now
constitutes
a
criminal
conspiracy.
in
the
peck
case,
judge
youngdahl
had
made
a
sharp
distinction
between
questions
dealing
with
what
he
said
was
the
past,
pre-1950,
which
he
said
were
not
permissible
questions
to
put
to
a
witness
but
he
said
that
the
situation
being
roughly
post-1950
might
be
different
because
since
1950,
the
patents
of
the
internal
security
act,
the
communist
movement
was
now
a
criminal
conspiracy.
now
after
considerable
colloquy
back
and
forth,
the
petitioner
made
the
point
clear
and
he
said
he
wanted
to
respond
to
the
committee
and
make
it
perfectly
clear
and
he
said
as
follows.
he
says,
"i
have
no
knowledge
or
information
whatever
of
anybody
who
does
or
wants
to
conduct
sabotage
and
espionage
or
illegal
interceptions
and
so
forth.
i
know
of
no
directives
of
anyone
at
all
to
do
this
kind
of
thing".
he
also
told
the
committee
he
never
heard
or
knew
of
no
directives
of
the
communist
party
to
obtain
control
of
the
american
communications
association.
at
that
point,
the
staff
director
announced
that
the
staff
interrogation
of
the
witness
was
concluded.
there
was
some
further
colloquy
at
which
point,
a
prepared
statement
which
the
witness
have
been
prepared
or
the
aide
of
counsel
was
then
read
into
the
record
although
prior
to
that,
the
committee
have
made
a
big
point
of
refusing
to
let
him
refer
to
it.
mr.
david
rein
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
believe
i
carried
the
statement
of
facts
to
the
point
where
the
staff
director
had
announced
that
the
staff
interrogation
of
the
witness
had
been
completed.
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
congressman
doyle,
then
inquired
of
the
two
other
members
of
the
subcommittee
whether
they
had
any
questions
to
put
to
the
petitioner.
both
answered
in
the
negative.
one
member
of
the
committee
mr.
scherer
added,
"have
a
motion
to
make
is
the
witness
excused".
the
staff
director
again
said,
"i
have
no
further
questions".
and
then
it
appears
in
the
record
that
the
conference
was
held
by
the
members
of
the
subcommittee
and
the
staff,
off
the
record
and
the
subject
of
that
conference
does
not
appear
on
the
record
of
the
transcript.
and
it
was
immediately
following
that
conference,
after
the
staff
director
had
said,
“the
staff
interrogation
was
concluded",
and
after
the
witness
had
said
that
he
had
no
information
on
any
of
the
subjects
which
were
the
stated
subjects
of
inquiry
as
set
forth
in
the
resolution.
it
was
after
all
that
happened
that
we
get
to
a
colloquy
which
lead
to
what
is
now
count
3
in
the
basis
of
the
indictment
and
the
conviction.
i
have
set
that
out
and
i
like
to
refer
the
court
to
follow
me
now,
my
brief
from
page
9
to
10.
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
mr.
doyle
said,
"witness
and
witness
counsel,
i
am
calling
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
believed
i
quoted
verbatim
the
testimony
of
mr.
mignon.
you
are
acquainted
with
him,
are
you?
you
know
who
he
is."
mr.
grumman,
"i
have
certainly
met
mr.
mignon."
mr.
doyle,
"certainly
met
him,
well
he
said
he
met
you."
now
on
yesterday,
he,
a
former
admitted
communist
for
several
years
in
the
same
union
of
which
you
are
now
secretary-treasurer
and
at
least
you
were
one
term
president
according
to
your
own
testimony,
voluntarily
named
a
number
of
the
officers
of
the
union
before
this
committee
and
he
named
you
frank
grumman,
secretary-treasurer
of
a.c.a.
local
10
and
mr.
fraser
was
another
member
of
the
subcommittee
and
dispersed
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
mr.
doyle
took
on,
"as
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
when
he
was
in
the
communist
party,
he
said
with
you
and
in
local
term,
he
said
that
he
sat
in
closed
communist
cell
meetings
with
you.
now,
i
will
ask
you
whether
or
not
he
was
telling
the
truth
or
was
he
telling
falsehood."
now,
that
big
mouthful
or
rather
long
discussion
is
what
the
indictment
claims
to
be
the
question
and
which
is
the
basis
for
the
question,
which
formed
the
conviction.
the
petitioner
replied,
"i
decline
to
answer
that
question
sir
on
the
same
grounds
as
previously
set
forth
in
the
statement"
and
as
i've
indicated,
the
statement
by
this
time,
it
included
in
the
record
and
the
statement
among
other
grounds
objected
to
the
lack
of
pertinency
of
some
questions.
mr.
scherer
said,
"i
asked
that
you
direct
the
witness
to
answer
the
question".
and
mr.
doyle
presumably
recognizing,
that
the
witness
had
objected
on
the
ground
of
pertinency,
and
recognizing
the
requirements
of
the
watkins
case,
went
to
answer
as
follows,
"i
direct
you
to
answer
the
question,
it
is
certainly
pertinent.
the
testimony
of
mr.
mignon
and
others
has
already
shown
before
this
committee
that
the
union
was
at
that
time
controlled
by
the
principal
officers,
by
identified
communists
in
control
of
the
policies
of
the
union
of
which
you
are
now
a
member
and
secretary-treasurer
in
the
field
of
international
cable
communications,
which
is
certainly
an
area
involving
the
secure
--
security
of
our
nation,
i
direct
you
to
answer
the
question."
the
petitioner
again
replied,
"sir,
i
decline
to
answer
the
question
on
the
grounds
of
lack
of
committee
jurisdiction
under
the
watkins
decision
and
on
the
grounds
of
the
lack
of
pertinency".
his
last
objection
went
unanswered
because
the
chairman
of
the
committee
then
went
on
to
something
else.
now,
we
submit
first,
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
that
the
government
failed
to
carry
its
burden
of
proof
to
show
the
pertinency
of
this
question,
whatever
it
may
have
showed
with
regard
to
the
inquiry
itself.
and
we
proceed
on,
which
i
believe
is
the
premises
established
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
a
conviction
of
contempt
may
be
sustained
only
if
the
particular
question
which
forms
the
basis
for
the
conviction
is
pertinent
to
the
subject
under
inquiry,
not
of
some
other
question
which
is
not
in
the
case.
and
it
is
not
enough
to
support
a
conviction
to
show
that
there
is
a
general
valid
subject
of
inquiry,
now,
and
also
under
the
doctrine
of
this
court,
if
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
prove
the
pertinency.
now,
the
particular
question
here
or
though
rather
obscurely
worded
input,
inquired
whether
or
not
the
witness
mignon
was
telling
the
truth
when
he
testified
that
he
had
attended
communist
cell
meetings
with
the
petitioner
at
some
undefined
period
between
1936
and
1940.
i
don't
know
when
it
was
but
we
know
it
was
certainly
no
later
than
1940
because
that's
when
mignon
left
the
communist
party.
now,
the
subcommittee's
authorizing
resolution
directed
an
inquiry
into
current
conditions
in
the
communications
industry.
furthermore,
by
the
time
this
question
had
been
put
to
the
witness,
the
witness
had
already
testified
that
he
had
no
knowledge
or
information
to
give
to
the
committee
concerning
these
subjects
of
espionage,
sabotage,
interception
of
communications
or
alleged
communist
control
of
the
union.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
give
them
some
testimony
to
the
effect
that
he
didn't
see
that
was
possible
for
anybody
to
engage
in
espionage
or
sabotage
and
under
current
conditions
but
the
committee
indicated
that
they
were
not
interested
in
that
type
of
testimony.
they
were
only
interested
in
testimony
which
said
that
there
would
be
a
danger
and
they
were
not
interested
in
any
witnesses'
testimony
that
said
there
was
no
danger.
these
were
the
subjects
that
fell
within
the
mandate
of
the
subcommittee.
and
petitioner
had
been
told
by
the
staff
director
earlier
during
the
colloquy
that
these
were
the
subjects
with
which
the
committee
was
concerned.
now,
this
particular
question
in
count
3
was
both
remote
in
time
and
seemingly
off
the
subject
of
the
inquiry.
it
certainly
has
no
a
priori
legitimate
connection
between
this
question
and
the
state
of
subject
under
inquiry.
now
despite
this,
the
government
wanted
to
prove
pertinency
although
it
doesn't
appear
from
the
face
of
the
matter.
if
the
government
burden
to
make
that
showing
at
trial.
at
the
trial,
they
showed
nothing
other
than
the
actual
transcript
of
the
case,
the
transcript
of
the
hearing.
so,
we
gained
nothing
other
than
what
i
have
already
read
to
your
honors
with
regard
to
the
question
of
pertinency.
now,
the
government
here
in
its
brief
offers
three
separate
grounds
of
pertinency
for
this
particular
question.
before
discussing
the
government's
grounds,
i
like
to
note
preliminarily
that
since
none
of
these
grounds
were
communicated
to
the
petitioner
at
the
hearing
itself
when
he
objected
to
pertinency,
i
do
not
believe
the
government
can
rely
upon
them
here
at
all.
i
think
that
principle
was
best
set
forth
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justices
harlan
and
frankfurter
in
deutch,
even
though
it
was
a
dissenting
opinion
that
spoke
i'm
sure
on
this
point
for
the
unanimous
court.
and
i
like
to
quote
very
briefly
from
that
because
it
--
it
expressed
it
quite
heavily.
it
said,
"the
government
must
stand
or
fall
upon
the
explanation
of
pertinency
given
at
the
legislative
hearing
since
it
would
obviously
unfair
to
allow
the
government
at
trial
to
prove
pertinency
on
a
different
theory
than
was
given
to
the
defendant
at
the
time
he
testified
and
on
the
basis
of
which
he
presumably
determined
that
it
need
not
answer
the
questions
put".
i
like
to
also
note
parenthetically
that
not
only
are
the
three
grounds
which
the
government
advances
for
pertinency
here
not
grounds
which
will
communicate
it
to
the
petitioner
at
the
hearing
but
they
were
not
grounds
which
apparently
occurred
to
anybody
either
at
the
trial
or
at
the
court
below
and
have
come
forth
from
the
government
for
the
first
time
in
the
brief
in
the
case
here.
the
government
contends
first
that
the
question
was
pertinent
because
the
government
says
it
tested
the
credibility
of
the
witness
mignon.
now,
we
submit
that
if
the
--
if
the
question
had
any
purpose,
it
is
certainly
was
not
to
test
the
credibility
of
the
witness
mignon.
not
only
was
the
petitioner
not
told
that
that
was
the
purpose
but
on
the
contrary,
after
he
refused
to
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
mignon
was
telling
the
truth
or
the
falsehood,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
reasserted
his
confidence
in
mignon's
testimony
and
he
said,
"mignon's
testimony
on
the
testimony
of
the
others
have
already
established
this
matter
to
our
satisfaction”.
it's
a
--
i
don't
see
how
anybody
could
possibly
conclude
from
that
that
the
committee
was
interested
in
testing
the
credibility
of
a
witness
whom
they
had
satisfied
themselves
was
a
reliable
witness
and
whom
they
had
classified
as
a
friendly
cooperative
witness
in
contrast
to
the
witness
--
to
the
petitioner.
further,
there
is
an
additional
objection
here.
furiously
enough
although
the
trial
court
never
bothered
to
state
why
he
considered
the
question
to
be
pertinent,
he
gave
no
reasons
at
all.
he
did
make
an
expressed
finding,
as
acknowledged
by
the
government
here,
that
the
question
was
not
put
to
the
petitioner
for
the
purpose
of
testing
mignon's
credibility.
now,
the
government
argues
here
that
the
trial
court
was
mistaken
on
that
point
and
this
court
can
disregard
the
trial
court's
finding.
i
suggest
the
matter
is
not
that
simple.
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
a
number
of
cases
particularly
in
sacher,
the
question
of
pertinency
and
particularly
the
explanation
of
pertinency
must
appear
to
the
petitioner
or
to
the
witness
while
he
is
on
the
witness
stand
with
what
has
been
described
as
undisputable
clarity
in
the
language
of
this
court.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
one
tribunal
says
that
the
question
does
not
have
that
meaning
or
significance
to
suggest
that
you
might
reject
and
overrule
that
it
seems
to
me
at
any
event,
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
question
does
not
indisputably
clear,
its
--
its
argument.
and
we
can
dispute
what
it
might
or
might
not
be.
and
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
the
principle
of
justice
harlan's
concurring
opinion
in
sacher
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
the
question
was
there,
it
cannot
be
set
to
be
indispu
--
indisputably
--
clearly
pertinent
to
the
subject
under
inquiry
when
the
lower
tribunals
below
had
differed
as
to
the
meaning
and
significance
of
the
questions.
secondly,
the
government
argues
that
the
question
was
pertinent
because
it
was
preliminary.
i
submit
that
certainly
that
suggestion
is
really
unpardonably
inaccurate.
the
question
was
put
to
the
witness
and
if
we
want
to
look
just
at
pages
in
the
transcript
in
the
record,
the
interrogation
was
commenced
and
the
printed
record
at
page
69,
this
particular
question
was
not
put
to
him
until
page
97.
it
was
put
to
him
almost
at
the
close
of
the
hearing.
it
was
after
the
staff
interrogation
had
been
concluded.
it
was
after
two
members
of
the
three-man
subcommittee
had
announced
that
they
had
no
further
questions.
one
of
them
actually
thought
that
the
witness
had
been
excused.
moreover,
the
witness
had
already
testified
that
he
had
no
information
as
to
the
announced
subjects
of
inquiry
and
yet
the
government
suggest
that
this
question
was
pertinent
because
it
was
preliminary.
preliminary
to
what?
i
do
not
know.
it
has
some
suggestion
here
that
if
he
had
answered
the
question,
the
committee
would
doubtless
of
going
on
and
done
several
other
things.
i
submit
that
--
mr.
david
rein
it
didn't
allege
anything,
your
honor.
the
indictments
never
alleged
as
one
of
the
points
in
our
brief.
mr.
david
rein
well,
we
have
briefed
in
our
brief
and
i
won't
have
time
to
get
into
it,
that
the
government
in
the
district
of
columbia
has
adopted
the
practice
of
never
alleging
the
subject
under
inquiry
or
never
alleging
pertinence.
and
i
think
as
i
say
at
my
brief,
and
it's
a
point
i
don't
think
i'd
be
able
to
brief,
i
think
they
do
it
decidedly
so
that
when
they
get
into
court,
particularly
on
appellate
court,
they're
free
to
move
around
and
think
of
different
subjects
under
inquiry
or
different
grounds
of
pertinency.
and
also
because
sometimes
when
these
cases
come
from
the
committee,
it's
very
hard
to
know
of
what
the
theory
of
the
committee
was
and
i
suppose
they
solved
--
mr.
david
rein
--
both
of
those
problems.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
what
the
theory
of
anybody
is
here
except
that
it
seems
to
me
this
question
clearly
is
not
pertinent.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
i
did
your
honor.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
well,
it's
not
--
i'm
sure
it's
preserved
in
the
record
without
the
necessity
of
taking
exception
under
our
procedure.
finally,
the
government
contends
that
the
question
and
this
is
a
contention
that
they
made
for
the
first
time
in
its
brief
here
although
they
did
not
even
have
in
the
opposition
to
assert
that
although
remote
in
time,
it's
pertinent
because
remote
questions
are
pertinent.
well,
i
just
suggest
that
that
only
begs
the
question
but
to
say
that
it's
pertinent
because
they
believe
it's
pertinent.
i
want
to
turn
now
to
my
second
prime
in
may
argument
and
that
is
the
failure
to
give
within
the
language
of
watkins
a
meaningful
explanation
of
the
pertinency
of
the
question
once
there
was
an
objection
on
the
ground
of
pertinency
and
to
quote
very
briefly
from
watkins
as
to
the
burden
placed
upon
the
committee,
i
think
on
occasion
when
there
is
an
objection,
to
be
meaningful,
the
explanation
must
describe
what
the
topic
under
inquiry
is
and
the
connective
reasoning
whereby
the
precise
questions
asked
relate
to
it.
now,
petitioner's
pertinency
objection
was
met
first
with
the
statement
of
congressman
doyle
that
the
question
was
certainly
pertinent.
now,
that
of
course
is
not
an
explanation.
he
followed
with
what
i
have
read
to
your
honors
and
i
have
set
out
again
at
page
30
of
my
brief,
simply
a
statement
that
they
were
satisfied
from
the
testimony
of
mignon
and
other
witnesses
that
they
really
had
all
the
information
they
needed
on
this
subject.
now,
that
would
only
raise
the
additional
problem
it
seems
to
me
as
to
--
it's
rather
right
for
the
subcommittee
to
decide
or
press
a
question
when
they
were
already
satisfied
that
they
had
all
the
information
they
needed
on
the
subject.
but
in
any
event,
whatever
view
one
might
take
of
congressman
doyle's
remarks,
it
certainly
does
not
contain
any
connective
reasoning,
connecting
count
3
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
and
least
of
all,
doesn't
suggest
any
of
the
reasons
given
by
the
government
here
to
support
pertinency.
i
have
only
a
brief
minute
or
two.
now,
i
like
to
just
suggest
if
i
may,
the
application
of
the
balancing
test
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
now,
the
court
below
and
i
believe
the
government
here
conceives
that
the
balancing
test
must
be
met
but
it
says
that
the
balancing
test
must
be
met,
and
i
want
to
take
it
from
a
different
point
of
view
not
so
much
the
rights
of
the
petitioner,
but
what
was
the
interest
of
the
government.
and
they
say
the
interest
of
the
government
was
to
preserve
the
communications
industry
against
disaster.
now,
i
would
like
to
submit
only
this
one
particular
question
to
your
honor
and
i
believe
it's
supported
by
the
language
of
these
cases.
what
connection
can
there
be
with
obtaining
an
answer
from
this
witness
to
this
question
as
to
whether
or
not
mignon
was
telling
the
truth
about
some
communist
meetings
in
1936
to
1940
with
a
security
of
the
nation.
and
i
think
it
is
important
--
mr.
david
rein
i
don't
concede.
mr.
david
rein
in
fact
but
let's
assume
that.
let's
assume
that.
mr.
david
rein
let's
assume
--
mr.
david
rein
the
question
--
mr.
david
rein
whether
he
was
at
communist
meetings
in
1936
to
1940.
i
say
we
have
the
same
problem.
what
is
that
going
to
help
particularly
in
the
context
already
established
of
a
witness
who
has
told
this
committee
that
he
had
no
information
on
all
of
these
espionage
and
sabotage?
more
than
that
let
me
indicate
--
mr.
david
rein
the
committee
is
not
bound
by
it,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
--
it
wasn't.
mr.
david
rein
well,
let's
put
it
this
way,
if
the
committee
is
not
interested
and
--
and
the
staff
director
there
has
made
it
perfectly
clear,
not
only
under
the
annual
report
reflects
that.
when
they
wrote
up
this
case,
they
resided
the
testimony
of
a
number
of
witnesses
who
said
that
there
was
a
great
danger
of
espionage
and
sabotage.
this
witness
and
other
witnesses
including
witnesses
from
the
industry,
who
said
that
the
nature
of
the
manner
in
which
the
messages
were
sent
was
such
that
espionage
was
almost
impossible.
it
was
let
completely
out
of
the
annual
report.
and
i
asked
mr.
arens
about
that
on
the
witness
stand
and
he
said,
"well,
we
did
not
include
in
our
conclusions
any
testimony
from
witnesses
in
whom
we
had
no
confidence,
we
did
not
interpose
much
confidence”.
now
if
they
want
to
disregard
his
testimonies,
they
were
going
to
disregard
it
anyway.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
but
this
is
--
the
purpose
of
this
question
is
not
to
cross-examine
him.
the
purpose
of
this
question
was
perfectly
clear
to
me
to
harass
him.
but
i
don't
know
or
much
more
likely
if
one
may
give
another
and
there's
a
good
bit
of
wisdom,
in
a
quotation
i
have
made
from
debrow's
case
and
i
think
one
must
was
recognized
that
even
where
there
is
a
valid
subject
of
inquiry
before
a
committee,
congressmen
have
a
tendency,
very
often,
to
ask
questions
from
either
curiosity
or
from
interest.
now
not
every
one
of
those
questions
has
a
great
bearing
on
the
subject
and
most
congressional
committees
i
believe
that
they
get
into
a
dispute
with
the
witness
or
something
rather
will
drop
the
matter.
i
can't
see
how
any
committee
can
seriously
believe,
who
is
seriously
interested
in
the
state
of
subject
of
inquiry,
can
seriously
believe
that
an
answer
to
this
question
would
have
been
of
any
assistance
to
it
or
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
of
such
importance
that
the
petitioner
here
is
entitled
to
go
--
should
be
sent
to
jail
for
four
months
for
refusing
to
answer.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
