he
is
sapient?
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
--
why
was
it
peculiar
about
the
language?
is
it
ordinary?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
have
pigeonholes
in
which
they
put
witnesses
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
advance.
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
indictments
alleged
that
the
subject
under
inquiry
was?
justice
potter
stewart
well
on
the
previous
case,
in
the
yellin
case,
the
indictment
did
allege
in
some
specific
detail
of
the
subject
under
inquiry.
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
this
case
you
don't
know
what
the
theory
of
the
grand
jury
was,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
let
me
just
--
you
--
you
were
to
concede
with.sure
that
was
just
an
indirect
way
of
asking
him
whether
he'd
been
in
those
conference
meetings.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
it's
an
--
justice
potter
stewart
alternate
way
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
stating
that
question.
justice
potter
stewart
all
those
are
three
separate
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
noticed
on
footnote

on
page

of
brief
that
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
exchanged
your
positions?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
what
markham
case
holds?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
in
shelton,
it
was
represented
to
us
that
was
a
holding
and
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
markham
case,
it
was
not.
justice
potter
stewart
instead,
you've
given
us
the
two
tests
by
which
the
sufficiency
of
an
indictment
isn't
measured
according
to
your
position,
would
they
be
any
different
with
respect
to
an
information?
would
they
be
the
same
--
those
two
tests
applied
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
well
then
what's
the
deference
between
--
what's
--
what's
the
purpose
then
in
requiring
an
indictment?
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
there
any
further
additional
test
applicable
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
an
indictment
which
are
not
applicable
to
an
information?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
grand
jury
supposedly
indicts
somebody
for
his
specific
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
his
first
argument
is
that
the
indictment
should
--
that
the
grand
jury
should
have
said
what
the
subject
was.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
this
--
his
first
step
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
be
based
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
should
have
said
identified
the
subject.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
take
that
to
mean
that
requirement
if
it
is
one
that
the
committee
must
not
utilize
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures
on
some
of
the
witnesses?
justice
potter
stewart
would
they
be
very
likely
to
do
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
alleged
in
the
shelton
case
that
they
did
something
fairly
close
to
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
couldn't
that
be
a
legitimate
inquiry?
all
our
gallup
--
gallup
poll,
let's
say
they
send
their
men
out
to
pick
up
every
tenth
man,
get
a
pair
of
sample
and
has
--
each
one
of
them
whether
or
not
he's
a
communist
then
they
get
how
many
--
how
many
--
what
the
percentage
of
communist
was
in
new
york
city.
