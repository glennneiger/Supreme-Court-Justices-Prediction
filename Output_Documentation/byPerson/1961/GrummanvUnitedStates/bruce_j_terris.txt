mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
in
the
grumman
and
silber
cases
were
convicted
for
refusing
to
answer
questions
during
an
investigation
of
communist
activities
in
the
communications
industry.
that
is
the
cable,
telegraph
and
radio
companies
which
transmit
messages
both
government
and
private
messages,
both
within
the
united
states
and
between
the
united
states
and
overseas.
the
american
communications
association,
a
leading
union
in
the
communications
industry,
had
been
expelled
from
the
c.i.o.
in
1950
for
following
communist
policies.
in
addition
to
this
information,
the
committee
had
considerable
information
that
principle
officers
of
the
association
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
was
to
discover
whether
these
officers
were
members
of
the
communist
party
and
whether
the
existence
of
communist
in
the
communications
industry
endanger
national
security.
if
such
a
danger
existed,
the
committee
indicated
that
it
will
--
that
it
would
propose
corrective
legislation.
therefore,
throughout
the
hearing,
the
committee
repeatedly
asked
witnesses
what
legislation
could
be
used
to
lessen
the
danger
from
communist
activity
in
the
communications
industry.
before
petitioner
grumman
appeared
before
the
committee,
and
of
course
also
before
petitioner
silber
appeared
since
he
was
subsequent
to
petitioner
grumman,
committee
heard
five
witnesses.
three
of
these
witnesses
were
leading
officials
of
large
companies
in
the
communications
industry.
the
other
two
witnesses
were
members
of
the
american
--
were
former
members
of
the
american
communications
association,
long
time
workers
in
the
communications
industry
and
former
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
latter
two
witnesses
testified
that
present
principle
officers
of
the
american
communications
association
had
at
least
at
the
time
that
the
witness
--
witnesses
had
been
in
the
communist
party,
been
members
of
the
communist
party.
petitioner
grumman,
like
petitioner
yellin,
had
been
publicly
identified
at
a
committee
hearing
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
michael
mignon
testified.
the
petitioner
grumman
and
he
had
been
members
of
local
10
of
the
american
communications
association
and
of
the
communist
party
together
and
that
they
had
attended
close
meetings
of
the
communist
party
together.
these
five
witnesses
further
testified
that
communist
in
the
communications
industry
posed
an
extremely
serious
danger
to
american
security
for
three
reasons.
the
first
reason
they
said
is
that
communist
could
intercept
secret
government
messages.
for
these
messages
were
generally
in
code,
they
thought
that
if
the
messages
were
copied
down
and
taken
away
from
the
--
particular
place
where
they
--
the
communications
place,
the
code
could
well
be
broken.
the
second
way
of
the
communist
posed
a
great
danger
was
that
in
a
time
of
crisis,
even
one
or
two
communist
could
easily,
in
a
few
minutes,
sabotage
key
components
necessary
to
send
important
government
messages.
and
the
third
reason,
that
communist
in
the
industry
post
a
great
danger,
was
that
during
an
emergency,
they
could
use
the
communication
system
to
send
messages
between
themselves.
when
petitioner
grumman
appeared
before
the
committee,
he
told
the
committee
that
he
was
a
long
time
officer
of
local
10
of
the
american
communications
association,
secretary-treasurer
to
be
exact
and
a
long
time
worker
in
the
industry,
25
years
in
r.c.a.
he
refused
to
answer
numerous
questions.
however,
his
conviction
was
based
solely
on
his
refusal
to
answer
a
single
question.
after
petitioner
had
refused
to
answer
questions
concerning
current
communist
activity
including
whether
he
was
currently
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
who
has
knowledge
about
current
communist
activity
in
the
communications
industry.
the
committee
went
back
to
advance
on
which
it
had
definite
information.
in
essence,
it
went
back
to
the
beginning
with
the
information
which
indicated
to
with
the
petitioner
grumman
did
have
information
concerning
the
subject
under
inquiry.
the
committee
therefore
asked
petitioner
whether
michael
mignon
was
telling
the
truth.
when
he
testified,
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
along
with
the
witness
of
the
communist
party
and
local
10.
and
the
petitioner
had
been
in
closed
communist
cell
meetings
with
the
witness.
this
question
we
submit
was
in
effect
whether
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
that
time,
which
was
between
1936
and
1940.
now,
before
i
turn
to
the
first
amendment
arguments
and
to
the
arguments
centering
on
pertinency,
i
would
like
to
consider
this
briefly.
the
question
was
--
which
mr.
rein
suggested,
whether
the
indictment
was
insufficient
because
it
did
not
state
the
subject
under
inquiry
in
specific
terms
and
did
not
state
the
relationship
of
the
particular
questions
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
and
in
addition,
a
subject,
an
argument
which
he
did
--
did
not
mention
whether
the
indictment
was
insufficient
because
it
alleged
that
the
refusal
to
answer
was
unlawful
but
did
not
state
that
it
was
willful.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
first
two
are
quite
--
are
--
are
really
--
are
really
the
same
thing.
well,
i
--
i
won't
--
i
wont
debate
that.
it
doesn't
really
--
i
think
the
answer
is
the
--
is
--
is
the
same
if
it
--
the
question
whether
you
have
to
state
the
subject
under
inquiry
in
the
specific
relationship
to
the
questions
to
that
subject,
the
--
the
government's
answer
at
least
is
--
it
--
is
the
same
for
both.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
but
the
--
the
content
of
our
answer
is
the
same,
that's
right.
all
these
questions,
all
three
of
them
broken
down
into
pieces
are
in
the
six
cases
that
were
in
the
--
that
were
submitted
to
this
court
in
the
fall
involving
contempt
of
congress.
now,
the
indictment
which
petitioner
attacks
is
identical
in
form
with
that
which
has
been
repeatedly
before
this
court,
in
watkins,
in
barenblatt,
in
wilkinson,
in
deutch
and
almost
every
one
of
the
other
cases
which
has
been
here.
yellin
is
an
exception,
braden
is
an
exception
insofar
as
willfulness
is
specific
but
i
believe
that
the
subject
under
inquiry
is
not
specific.
and
both
the
petitioner's
contentions
have
been
repeatedly
rejected
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
in
fact,
there
is
no
decision
that
we
know
of
which
supports
petitioner's
contention,
any
one
of
the
three
contentions.
now,
turning
more
specifically
to
petitioner's
contention
that
the
indictment
should
have
specified
the
particular
subject
under
inquiry
in
the
particular
pertinency
of
the
questions
to
this
subject.
rule
7
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
states
that
the
indictment,
and
i'm
quoting,
"shall
be
a
plain
concise
and
definite
written
statement
of
the
essential
facts
constituting
the
offense
charged".
the
federal
courts,
including
this
court,
have
repeatedly
held
that
the
rule
7
requires
no
more
than
the
indictment
and
charge
the
essential
elements
of
the
offense
in
terms
--
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
so
that
the
defendant
can
adequate
--
adequately
prepare
his
defense
and
prevent
a
second
prosecution
for
the
same
offense.
and
i
may
say
that
rule
7
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
under
it
and
the
decisions
to
that
matter
of
the
court
--
courts
of
appeals
have
indicated
that
--
that
there
are
--
that
increasingly,
the
idea
of
indictments
is
to
be
a
simple
and
as
brief
as
possible.
if
--
the
whole
trend
of
the
cases
has
been
in
this
direction,
petitioner's
quite
technical
argument,
it
seems
to
us
to
ask
--
to
go
back
at
least
in
part
to
the
old
rules
of
technical
and
complicated
and
very
full
indictments.
in
the
markham
case
even
as
long
ago
as
160
united
states,
however,
this
court
stated
that
an
allegation,
that
a
false
statement
was
material
to
an
inquiry
then
pending,
and
i'm
quoting
"was
material
to
an
inquiry
then
pending".
an
allegation
which
is
virtually
identical
to
that
made
and
the
indictment
here
was
sufficient
to
charge
perjury.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
was
not
a
holding.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
that
is
not
a
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
that
is
not
a
holding.
but
the
dic
--
but
the
dictum
is
showing
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
was
a
mistake.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
was
a
mistake,
your
honor.
it
was
--
it
is
not
a
holding
because
the
court
went
on
in
markham
after
stating
quite
fully
that
this
was
sufficient,
that
it
went
on
to
say
that
you
can
interpret
from
that
indictment
what
the
subject
under
inquiry
was.
however,
there's
full
paragraph
--
in
fact,
i
think
at
the
point
that
you
mention
at
the
footnote,
we
said
our
--
most
to
their
paragraph,
although
not
all,
in
which
the
court
with
--
with
obvious
approval
set
forth
numerous
statements
by
authorities
saying
that
all
that
had
to
be
stated
in
the
indictment
was
that
that
the
inquiry
was
material
without
specifying
the
particular
subject
to
the
inquiry.
and
this
court
stated
in
the
sinclair
case
that
the
pertinency
of
questions
to
the
subject
under
inquiry,
in
a
contempt
case
is
not
essentially
different
from
the
question
as
to
the
materiality
of
false
testimony
charged
this
perjury
in
prosecutions
for
that
crime.
now,
turning
from
perhaps
what
is
the
--
the
technical
rules
of
what
an
indictment
must
charge
to
the
purpose
for
which
the
indictment
is
required
to
charge
var
--
various
elements
to
the
offense,
this
court
in
the
debrow
case
and
in
--
and
in
another
recent
cases
have
--
has
said
that
indictment
must
charge
the
elements
of
defense
for
two
purposes.
first,
in
order
to
give
the
defendants
sufficient
information
to
defend
himself
and
second,
to
prevent
a
second
prosecution
for
the
same
offense.
now,
the
indictment
here
gave
petitioner,
we
submit,
ample
information
to
prevent
any
possibility
of
a
second
prosecution
for
the
same
offense.
it
has
specified
the
subcommittee
which
held
the
hearings,
the
date
of
the
hearings
and
the
questions,
the
particular
questions
which
petitioner
refuse
to
answer.
therefore,
we
--
we
believe
that
there
is
no
possibility
that
he
could
be
tried
again
for
this
offense.
now,
the
only
serious
argument
really
the
petitioner
has,
that
the
failure
of
the
indictment
to
specify
the
subject
under
inquiry
and
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
to
the
subject
under
inquiry,
was
that
it
deprived
of
a
fair
chance
to
defend
himself.
that
is
--
i
hope
to
your
time
to
show
petitioner
as
this
court
is
required
was
specifically
apprised
at
the
hearing
of
the
subject
under
inquiry
and
the
relationship
of
the
question,
the
questions
which
he
refused
to
answer
to
that
subject.
this
transcript
as
a
public
document,
that
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
he
understood
the
subject
under
inquiry,
if
there
is
doubt,
if
he
was
not
apprised,
then
of
course
quite
outside
of
the
--
of
the
indictment
question,
he
could
not
have
been
convicted
under
this
court's
rule
in
the
barenblatt
and
in
--
in
deutch
cases.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
would
think
so.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
you
go
to
a
grand
jury.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
there's
--
there's
one
of
course
additional
protection
for
the
defendant.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
goes
--
they
go
to
a
grand
jury
and
the
grand
jury
supposedly
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
but
it
the
--
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
clear
that
all
that
it
has
to
do
is
set
forth
the
elements.
now,
it
set
forth
the
elements.
it
said
that
the
questions
were
pertinent.
now,
petitioner's
argument
is
what
should
have
said
why
they're
pertinent.
in
order
to
do
that,
it
would
have
--
it
would
have
to
say
that
they're
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that's
part
of
why
they're
pertinent.
you
state
what
the
--
the
subject
and
then
you
give
the
connective
reasoning
between
the
questions
to
the
subject.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
okay.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
okay.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
okay.
that
is
not
an
essential
element
of
the
offense.
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
in
the
--
in
the
statute.
if
the
statute
requires
that
the
--
that
the
questions
be
pertinent,
the
grand
jury
charged
the
petitioners
and
actually
this
issue
only
comes
up
in
these
three
cases
in
the
grumman
case.
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
pertinent
questions.
now,
as
we
read
this
--
this
court's
decisions,
that's
all
that's
necessary.
for
example
in
the
debrow
case,
which
was
a
--
which
was
a
perjury
prosecution,
the
court
held
that
it
was
enough
to
charge
that
the
--
that
the
person
before
whom
the
perjury
committed
was
authorized.
he
didn't
have
to
give
the
authority.
he
didn't
have
to
specify
what
the
authority
was.
that
was
a
part
--
that
was
a
question
of
proof.
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
question
which
has
to
be
in
indictment.
now
this,
as
i
have
said
before,
is
part
of
the
--
we
believe
that
the
whole
trend
of
decisions
recently
which
is
the
indictments
are
supposed
to
be
extremely
simple.
they're
just
supposed
to
set
out
the
elements
of
--
of
the
crime
and
suggest
insufficient
detail
to
prevent
a
second
prosecution
and
to
give
the
--
the
defendant
enough
information
to
defend
himself.
as
i've
said,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
had
this
information
here
because
he
was
specifically
told
that
at
--
at
--
by
the
committee
himself
--
by
itself.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
it
was
--
it
was
raised
before
trial,
your
honor.
we've
--
we
make
contention
that
it
wasn't
--
that
it
wasn't
timely.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i've
--
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
--
i
assume
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
would
--
yes
--
yes,
i
--
i
--
just
because
we
don't
have
it
--
the
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
testimony,
i
don't
know.
but
i
assume
that
--
yes,
indeed,
i
--
i
assume
that
the
hearings
were
submitted
to
it
and
that
of
course
is
where
we
rely
on
to
show
pertinency,
the
subject
under
inquir
--
inquiry
and
the
connective
reasoning
between
the
question
and
the
subject.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
you
honor,
i
submit
that
that's
a
danger
which
the
--
this
court's
--
the
trend
of
this
court's
decisions
leave
possible,
the
idea
that
you
don't
have
to
specify
every
detail
that
has
--
that's
going
to
be
proved.
now,
every
time
you
leave
out
a
detail,
this
--
this
--
it's
essential
to
the
proof
then
there's
a
possibility
that
the
grand
jury
guessed
wrong
just
as
your
honor
suggest.
it
found
one
subject
when
in
--
in
fact
the
government
was
going
to
rely
at
the
trial
at
another
subject.
yes,
there
is
that
danger.
in
the
debrow
case,
there
was
a
danger
that
--
that
the
grand
jury
there
found
one
basis
of
authority
and
it
was
wrong
then
another
basis
of
authority
was
proved
by
the
government
in
the
trial.
but
we
submit
that
if
rule
7
is
to
be
taken
on
its
face
value
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
interpreting
it
that
that
--
that
that
danger
is
inevitable.
and
they
say
that
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
a
charge
made
in
an
indictment,
important
as
the
--
as
the
indictment
is,
an
actual
trial
on
the
issues
of
guilt
and
innocence.
i
think
your
honor
that
i
--
your
honors
that
i
leave
the
issue
of
willfulness,
whether
the
indictment
must
--
must
charge
that
the
refusal
was
willful
rather
than
charging
that
it
was
unlawful
to
our
brief,
i
don't
think
it's
a
very
serious
contention
and
that
it
is
rather
technical
and
is
better
left
to
the
brief.
as
to
petitioner
grumman's
first
amendment
contentions,
they,
like
the
first
amendment
contentions
of
the
other
petitioners,
we
believe
are
controlled
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson.
the
interest
of
the
witness
in
silence
is
the
same
as
the
interest
--
the
interest
of
the
witnesses
in
those
cases
in
silence.
petitioner
was
not
pilloried
by
the
committee,
did
not
appear
as
a
result
of
indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures
since
he
was
specifically
identified
in
sworn
testimony
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
would
think
that
they
cannot
call
somebody
off
the
street
and
say,
"dude,
what
do
you
know
about
communism?"
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no,
they
wouldn't.
but
i
don't
--
the
--
the
fact
that
committees
unlikely
to
abuse
its
power,
doesn't
mean
that
the
--
that
the
limitation
on
its
power
is
not
a
--
a
meaningful
one.
no,
i
hope
they
wouldn't
and
i
don't
know
cases
in
which
they
have
done
that
kind
of
thing.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
was
alleged,
your
honor
but
i
think
that
--
but
the
government's
position
at
least
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
was
that
the
facts
were
quite
different.
they
would
--
that
the
government
did
have
information
which
shows
that
--
that
the
person
who
was
subpoenaed
to
testify
was
the
person
who
knew
something
about
communist
activities.
if
a
defendant
show
that
the
committee
had
just
called
him
off
the
street,
i
--
i
would
think
that
barenblatt
means
that
the
--
the
first
amendment
has
been
violated.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
don't
want
to
say
that
that's
the
full
extent
but
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
barenblatt
and
the
other
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
--
that
this
court
and
the
other
federal
courts
have
to
presume
that
congress
of
the
united
states
is
--
is
acting
lawfully
and
that
they
will
not
have
a
full
scale
inquiry
into
whether
it
had
justification,
probable
cause
as
you
will
or
--
or
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
did
i
--
i
tried
to
answer
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
by
saying
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
to
say
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
clear
cases
if
they
have
no
information.
let's
just
assume
they
say,
"we
have
no
information.
we
think
that
there's
a
lot
of
communist
activity
in
new
york
city.
we're
going
to
ask
the
new
yorkers,
what
do
you
know
about
it?"
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
as
i
read
the
--
the
barenblatt
and
the
--
and
of
course
this
is
picked
up
to
some
extent
in
wilkinson
and
braden
that
although
that
might
have
reasonableness
that
this
may
--
might
well
be
how
an
investigator
would
proceed,
that
the
important
first
amendment
rights
which
are
being
weighed
and
i
think
contrary
to
petitioners
that
--
that
this
court
in
those
three
cases
gave
very
great
weight
to
the
first
amendment
right
and
weighing
those
important
rights
that
--
that
there
had
to
be
some
more
basis
than
the
fact
that
anybody
in
that
stables.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
i'd
rather
take
with
the
--
the
court's
phrasing
your
honor.
the
court
said
in
barenblatt
that
the
witness
had
not
been
subpoenaed
as
a
result
of,
and
i
quote
"indiscriminate
dragnet
procedures
lacking
improbable
cause
for
belief
that
he
possessed
information
which
might
be
helpful
to
the
subcommittee".
now,
insofar
as
--
the
way
i
read
that,
that
means
that
a
reasonable
man
has
to
think
if
the
person
has
information
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
one
of
the
difficulties
is
that
--
that
words
often
mean
something
--
different
words
than
their
--
depending
on
their
context.
it
seem
--
i
will
be
willing
to
agree
with
you
if
you
--
if
you
suggest
by
that
the
probable
cause
means
something
quite
different
in
this
context
than
for
arrest,
searches
and
seizures
and
--
and
the
like.
they
have
to
have
a
reasonable
ground
to
think
that
the
person
has
information
of
value
to
me.
i
don't
think
they
have
to
have
probable
cause
that
he's
a
communist.
for
example,
if
they
have
--
if
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
associated
with
communist
or
he
was
an
officer
in
a
--
in
a
group
that
was
heavily
--
that
was
--
that
--
that
was
heavily
unfiltered
--
infiltrated
by
communist
so
that
he
would
likely
know
about
his
fellow
officers
or
the
like.
i
may
say
that
this
issue
is
not
in
this
case.
it
is
in
the
silber
case,
it
is
in
the
shelton
case
and
a
few
of
the
others
that
were
argued
in
the
false.
it's
not
in
this
case.
i
assume
for
the
reason
that
michael
mignon
on
this
--
before
the
committee
swore
that
this
defendant
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
which
is
the
same
type
of
information
which
this
court
relied
on
in
barenblatt.
actually,
in
barenblatt,
the
court
didn't
even
rely
on
the
sworn
testimony.
it
relied
on
the
statement
of
committee
counsel
that
he
had
information,
the
kind
of
statement
which
was
in
the
shelton
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
i
--
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
the
basic
principle.
now,
the
way
i
read
barenblatt,
braden
and
wilkinson
is
that
to
some
very
limited
extent,
the
prin
--
the
principle
is
limited
by
the
important
first
amendment
rights
which
are
involved.
but
i
think
if
--
i
think
you're
--
you're
absolutely
right.
the
basic
principle
is
that
a
committee
can
call
anybody
it
wants
to.
now,
if
first
amendment
rights
weren't
involved
here
at
all,
it
didn't
have
any
basis,
any
first
amendment
rights
whatsoever,
i
think
they
can
call
anybody
right
off
the
street.
now,
because
the
first
amendment
rights
are
involved,
i
read
those
three
cases
to
indicate
that
part
of
the
balance
is
whether
they've
indiscriminately
called
the
witness.
but
i
think
that's
a
very
limited
exception
to
the
general
principle.
and
i
think
that's
--
and
that's
--
but
i
think
that's
quite
clear
from
the
three
opinions.
because
of
the
limited
time
i
have
left,
i
--
i
would
--
i
think
i
would
rather
turn
to
the
pertinency
contentions
made
by
petitioner
grumman
since
they
are
essentially
the
only
contentions
which
he
makes
which
are
different
from
those
made
in
the
yellin
case.
now,
it's
perfectly
clear
the
subject
that
the
question
on
which
petitioner
was
convicted
was
in
law
pertinent
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
the
resolution
of
the
committee
authorizing
the
hearings,
the
statement
of
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
at
the
start
of
the
hearings
and
repeated
statements
during
the
hearings
said
that
the
subject
under
inquiry
was
communist
activity
in
the
communications
industry
and
the
question
which
petitioner
refused
to
answer
on
its
phase
considering
the
fact
that
petitioner
admitted
that
he
was
a
long
time
worker
in
the
industry
and
a
member
of
the
american
communications
association
was
on
its
phase
pertinent
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
now,
petitioner
grumman's
main
contention
seems
to
be
that
there's
an
exception
to
this
obviously
close
connection
because
the
question
concerned
events
between
1936
and
1940
and
it
was
therefore
remote
in
time
to
the
subject
under
inquiry
which
was
current
communist
activities
in
the
communications
industry.
now,
the
government
submits
that
there
are
three
ways
that
the
question
which
petitioner
refused
to
answer
was
pertinent
in
law.
first,
we
submitted
--
tested
the
credibility
of
our
previous
witness,
michael
mignon.
but
though
the
trial
court
did
not
think
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
question,
we
submit
that
this
is
not
a
determination
of
fact.
and
on
its
phase,
the
question
tested
the
credibility
of
michael
mignon
before
it
explicitly
asked
petitioner
whether
mignon
was
telling
the
truth.
and
the
second
way
that
the
question
--
the
information
sought
whether
question
would
be
useful
was
that
if
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1940,
he
could
provide
information
about
communist
party
activities
at
that
time
and
such
information
would
be
important,
we
submit,
in
understanding
the
present
and
future
activities
of
the
communist
party.
it
is
particularly
necessary
in
investigating
the
communist
party
just
largely
conspiratorial
in
secret
and
in
the
early
1950's,
went
almost
entirely
underground,
perhaps
more
than
any
other
subject
to
question
witnesses
about
earlier
communist
party
activities.
and
therefore,
this
court
in
the
communist
party
case
specifically
held
that
evidence
of
communist
party
activities
20
or
even
30
years
ago
was
pertinent
to
the
party's
current
activities
and
character.
and
the
third
way
that
this
question
sought
information
which
was
pertinent
was
that
the
question
on
which
petitioner
was
convicted
was
a
preliminary
question.
i
may
say
that
in
wilkinson,
this
court
upheld
under
both
--
a
tax,
both
on
the
grounds
of
pertinency
and
the
first
amendment,
an
inquiry
which
it
said
was
a
preliminary
question.
committee
told
petitioner
that
the
purpose
of
questions
as
to
its
membership
in
the
communist
party
was
to
provide
a
basis
on
which
to
question
petitioner
concerning
current
party
activities
in
the
communications
industry.
now,
turning
to
the
second
half
of
the
--
of
the
pertinency
issue
whether
petitioner
was
apprised
of
the
subject
under
inquiry
and
the
pertinency
of
the
questions,
petitioner
claims
that
there
were
--
that
the
three
reasons
which
i
have
just
given,
why
the
question
was
not
too
remote,
was
not
conveyed
to
him
by
the
committee
at
that
time
that
he
refused
to
answer
and
that
therefore,
he
was
not
apprised
of
the
pertinency
of
the
questions.
he's
--
it
is
important
to
remember
at
the
start
that
a
congressional
committee
need
only
state
the
connective
reasoning
between
the
question
and
the
subject
under
in
quarrel
--
inquiry.
surely,
the
statement
need
not
have
the
subtlety
or
the
fullness
of
a
brief
or
argument
in
the
supreme
court.
the
fact
that
the
government
has
spelled
out
in
greater
detail
the
pertinency
of
the
question,
it
does
not
seem
to
us
that
the
committee
wasn't
--
was
required
to
give
the
page
on
page
of
our
argument
to
the
witness
in
that
kind
of
detail.
petitioner
could
not
have
failed
to
understand
the
pertinency
of
the
questions.
the
committee
repeatedly
told
him
the
subject
under
inquiry
was
communist
activities
in
the
communications
industry.
the
question
as
to
whether
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
with
michael
mignon
was
on
its
phase
clearly
pertinent
to
this
subject.
and
this
court
so
held
in
the
barrenblatt
and
in
the
wilkinson
cases
that
a
question
as
the
communist
party
membership
was
on
its
phase
pertinent
to
an
investigation
of
communist
activities.
and
in
addition,
the
committee
told
petitioner
that
the
questions
as
to
his
membership
in
the
communist
party
were
pertinent
because
they
were
intended
to
ascertain
whether
petitioner
could
provide
information
concerning
communist
activities
in
the
communications
industry.
the
committee
did
not
specifically
state
why
the
question
was
not
too
remote
since
petitioner
never
suggested
that
the
question
concerned
events
which
were
too
remote.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
yes.
and
i'm
--
i
may
say
your
honor
that
the
right
of
the
witness
to
be
represented
by
a
counsel
and
to
advise
his
client
and
only
to
advise
his
client
is
not
just
a
practice
of
the
committee,
it's
in
the
rules
of
the
committee
and
the
rules
are
all
in
the
back
of
the
--
of
the
yellin
record.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
may
not
ask
questions.
in
fact,
he
--
he
cannot
engage
in
public
debate
with
the
committee.
he
is
confined
to
advising
his
client
as
to
his
rights.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
he
--
he
is
entitled
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
to
whisper
in
his
--
in
his
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
rules
say
not
but
--
but
it
is
so
--
as
long
as
the
--
the
colloquy
doesn't
go
on
too
long
if
that
the
--
the
rules
seems
to
be
--
not
to
be
honored
too
well.
the
initial
argument
seems
to
take
place
and
when
it
gets
too
long
then
it
--
then
--
then
it's
cut
off
if
the
rules
say
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that's
the
normal
thing
and
occasionally
gets
into
--
into
open
debate.
in
conclusion
your
honor
on
this
issue
and
--
and
by
argument
in
general,
the
committee
clearly
indicated
the
petitioner
that
was
interested
in
current
communist
party
activities.
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
all
the
questions
on
current
party
activities
then
the
committee
went
back
to
the
beginning,
to
the
source
of
its
information.
and
at
that
point,
it
asked
petitioner
if
he
had
been
a
communist
in
effect
in
1940.
we
submit
that
this
question
was
clearly
pertinent.
thank
you,
your
honor.
