justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
lives
there.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
the
charge
in
the
complaint
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
he
alleges
that
he
regularly
practices
in
both
states?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
of
whether
--
i
don't
understand.
you
have
to
get
down
to
a
factual
determination
of
whether
it
is
true
that
he
regularly
practices
in
both
states?
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
we
not
here
and
did
not
the
kansas
court
here
have
to
take
this
through
the
unchallenged
affirmance
of
this
complaint?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
there
isn't
any
factual
issue
on
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
far
as
we
now
stand.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
see
why
in
factual
determination
except
--
because
no
other
man
was
regularly
practicing
in
both
states.
if
you're
regularly
practicing
in
both
states,
i
assume,
that
if
one
state
didn't
say
that
you
have
to
hire
a
lawyer
in
the
other
state,
so
could
you
in
its
neighbor.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
say
that
mr.
martin
or
one
in
his
class
may
do
office
work
counseling
and
the
like,
but
he
is
stopped
only
at
the
courthouse
door,
is
that
too
your
understanding?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
what
does
that
do
to
the
kansas
conclusion
of
competence,
saying
that
he
doesn't
have
competence
to
handle
one
class
of
law
business
when
they
admit
he
has
competence
to
handle
law
--
other
classes
or
law
business.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
on
this,
if
martin
had
competence
to
do
the
latter,
is
to
try
cases,
the
day
before
this
rule
was
passed
like
kansas,
did
he
lose
it
by
the
rule?
therefore,
is
the
really
basis
for
the
so-called
cause
judicial
knowledge
which
judge
bassler
took.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
legality
as
opposed
to
illegality.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
talking
about
competence.
i
assume
that
you'll
not
be
less
competent
tomorrow
than
you
are
today,
and
i
would
think
that
the
rule
which
simply
barge
you
on
the
basis
of
competence
between
today
and
tomorrow
would
be
wholly
arbitrary.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
i
just
think
it's
our
business
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
basis
for
them
to
do
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
if
kansas
--
has
kansas
ever,
in
any
way,
impaired
except
by
this
rule,
keith
martin's
license,
its
certification
of
his
competence
to
practice
law
in
kansas?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
can
he
use
it
today?
can
he
use
it
today?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
can
use
if,
can
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
he
gets
another
local
lawyer
to
associate
with
him,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright,
now
i
can
ask
you
then,
why
is
it
he
cannot
use
the
license,
his
kansas
license,
to
practice
law
in
kansas
without
associating
with
someone
else
with
him,
why?

charles
