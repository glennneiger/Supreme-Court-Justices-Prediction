mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
answer
a
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
correct
answer
to
with
was
not
given
with
regard
to
the
number
of
affected
sir,
at
page
27
of
the
record
appears
this
statement,
of
that
number,
an
estimated
300
are
kansas
licensed
attorneys
who
reside
in
kansas
but
who
regularly
practice
in
missouri.
so,
we
have
a
somewhat
larger
group.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
some
300,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
now,
this
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir?
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
if
i
may
answer
that
in
this
way,
your
honor,
the
rule
--
and
i
want
to
get
to
that
next,
the
rule
talks
about
those
and
the
criterion
is
made,
those
attorneys
who
are
licensed
in
kansas
but
who
regularly
practice
in
another
jurisdiction,
that
is
the
touchstone.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
cannot
answer
as
to
those
who
regularly
practice
in
kansas,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
but
i
thought
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
attempting
to
get
at
the
size
of
the
group
which
is
within
the
scope
of
rules
41
and
54,
with
which
we
are
here
concerned.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
somewhere
along
the
line
would
be
a
factual
determination
which
in
this
case
has
been
pleaded
by
mr.
martin
that
he
regularly
practices
in
missouri,
and
i
don't
think
that
mr.
payne,
his
attorney,
will
stand
before
this
court,
and
tell
this
court
that
mr.
martin
spent
anywhere
near
one-half
of
his
time
in
any
office
in
kansas.
it's
just
a
name
on
the
door,
he
keeps
regular
office
hours
in
missouri
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
we
have
here
in
this
petition,
mr.
martin,
it
was
drawn
by
his
counsel
not
by
me,
your
honor.
he
alleges
that
he
regularly
practices
in
missouri
and
therefore
puts
himself
within
the
category.
we're
not
here
on
a
factual
question
as
to
whether
mr.
martin
is
or
is
not
within
the
category
embraced
by
these
rules.
that
has
been
determined
by
mr.
martin.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
it
has
not
been
taken
down
to
the
point,
your
honor,
of
so
many
hours,
no.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
the
only
standard
is
the
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
is
the
rule
itself,
regularly
practicing
in
missouri.
there
are
kansas
decisions
heretofore
on
what
constitutes
law
practice.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
for
instance,
and
this
applies
if
it
please
you,
your
honor,
to
only
--
to
appearances
before
the
courts,
commissions,
and
boards
in
the
state
of
kansas,
mr.
martin
can
examine
abstracts,
he
can
draw
bids
all
he
wants
in
the
state
of
kansas
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir,
i'm
coming
to
that.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
all
of
these
--
all
of
these
things
would
be
embraced,
every
act
within
the
practice
of
law.
that
is
those
things
which
are
considered
to
be
the
practice
of
law
whether
it
is
trial
work,
whether
it
is
examination
of
abstracts,
preparation
of
the
contracts,
those
things
that
are
limited
by
what
the
court
shaped
by
excluding
the
practice
of
law
from
those
who
are
not
licensed
attorneys.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
no
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
because
he
is
not
regularly
engaged.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
there
is
no
further
definition
that
--
than
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
the
word
“regularly”
but
i
submit
to
your
honor,
without
putting
into
an
equation
of
hours,
that
no
more
self-explanatory
definition
could
be
given.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
regularly.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
is
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
think
not.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
because
he
is
not
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
regularly
engaged
in
the
practice
in
missouri.
i
frequently
go
to
missouri.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
no,
sir,
because
i
do
not
regularly
engaged
in
the
practice
of
law
in
missouri.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
if
that
is
not
a
standard,
then
there
is
none,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
that
is
what
i
am
saying.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
would
say
maybe
the
law
itself,
maintains
an
office
in
a
bank
building
in
kansas
city,
missouri
and
i
believe
he
has
his
name
on
and
off
his
door
out
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
has
been
changed.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
was
so,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
think
he
is
not
your
honor,
because
he
maintains
that
office
in
kansas
city
missouri,
and
during
regular
office
hours,
he
is
in
the
office
in
kansas
city
missouri,
you
can
anymore
find
him
in
mission,
kansas
during
what
we
consider
regular
office
hours
than
anything.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
live
in
johnson,
practice
in
wyandotte,
yes,
sir?
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
think
not,
i
think
when
you
reach
that
point,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
at
that
time,
the
factual
termination
would
be
made
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
which
we
do
not
have
here.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
somewhere
along
the
line,
where
you
draw
the
line.
this
man
says
that
he
regularly
practices
in
missouri,
that
is
what's
before
this
court.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
--
that
is
the
appellant's
petition
filed
in
the
trial
court,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
but
in
one
place,
he
says,
he
regularly
practices
in
missouri
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
and
if
we
ever
get
down
to
that
point,
then
there
would
--
there
have
to
be
a
factual
determination.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
no.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
but
if
he's
--
if
missouri
pass
such
a
law,
and
then
we
came
up
on
the
question
of
which
of
these
two
statues
controls
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
sir?
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
but
it
has
not
been
done
today.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
do
not
argue,
your
honor,
that
he
could
not.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
do
not
make
that
argument.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
so
assume
also.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
he
would
take
an
entrance
examination.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
a
foreign
lawyer
who
comes
in
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
to
appear
before
a
court,
board
or
commission
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
in
the
state
of
kansas?
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
there
was
a
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
well
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
mr.
justice
black,
i
cannot
answer
that.
i
came
into
this
case
in
august
of
this
year.
i
do
know,
and
i
will
say
this
to
you,
i
do
know
that
there
was
interest
shown
by
the
bar
associations
after
the
rules
were
passed
and
when
the
pinch
was
felt.
i
cannot
tell
this
court,
yay
or
nay,
whether
that
interest
was
displayed
in
the
promulgation
of
these
rules.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
no,
sir.
this
--
i
do
not
know
of
other
situations
in
the
united
states.
this
and
we
have
been
speaking
here
this
morning
of
only
the
borderline
between
kansas
and
missouri.
kansas
also
borders
on
oklahoma.
there's
a
case
from
that
jurisdiction
in
my
brief
showing
what
can
have.
we
border
on
colorado
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
we
border
on
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
all
right,
here,
your
honor,
is
this
situation
--
there
was
a
lawyer
licensed
to
practice
in
kansas,
practice
regularly
in
oklahoma,
he
resided
in
oklahoma,
but
to
me,
residence
doesn't
mean
a
lot.
it
is
one
criteria
and
one
thing
demanded
at
many
states.
but
to
me,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
professional
competence.
a
carpenter
can
live
80
years
in
kansas,
and
not
be
qualified
to
practice
law.
this
lawyer,
relying
upon,
apparently,
upon
his
knowledge
and
everyday
usage
of
the
law
of
oklahoma,
came
in
to
kansas,
and
he
filed
his
action
in
the
wrong
court.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
do
not
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
do
not
say
that
this
is
a
cure
all
and
end
all,
your
honor.
but
i
do
say
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
that
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
has
a
right
to
expect
that
beneficial
effects
will
flow
from
requiring
that
lawyers
who
regularly
practice
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
will
have
associated
with
them,
counsel
who
regularly
practice
in
the
judicial
district
in
which
that
case
is
pending.
for
this
reason,
it's
mere
human
nature,
but
human
nature
is
why
we
need
laws.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
am
not
admitted
to
practice
in
missouri.
anytime
i
go
to
missouri,
i
associate
local
counsel
in
missouri.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
is
right.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
is
right.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
i
don't
shy
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
don't
shy
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
because
what
we
have
in
this
case,
and
two
or
three
places
in
the
appellant's
brief,
the
client
call
was
supposed
ex
post
facto
judicial
notice
of
the
supreme
court
of
kansas.
but
in
the
opinion
of
that
court,
what
the
court
says
is,
that
prior
to
the
promulgation
of
these
rules,
we
took
judicial
notice,
they
could
not
only
take
judicial
notice.
they
could
do
as
any
other
court
does,
have
judicial
conferences
and
take
actual
notice
of
those
things
that
were
obstructing,
hindering
or
having
a
detrimental
effect
on
the
administration
of
the
law
in
kansas,
that
was
done
--
these
rules,
as
your
honor
asked
before,
these
are
legislative
in
nature.
i
don't
question
that
at
all.
and
i
don't
question
that
they
are
subject
to
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clause.
being
legislative
in
nature
and
being
promulgated
as
rules
by
the
court,
and
not
as
a
decision
of
the
court
on
a
matter
before
that
court,
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
not
only
had
the
right,
but
in
my
opinion,
have
the
duty
to
ascertain
all
they
could.
then,
in
the
opinion,
they
set
out
their
reasons
why
they
felt
that
the
promulgation
of
these
rules
was
necessary,
and
a
question
was
asked
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
no,
it
has
not,
your
honor.
no,
it
has
not.
there
is
no
requirement
in
that
regard
though.
when
i
go
to
mr.
payne's
county,
i
sometimes
ask
mr.
payne,
because
i
think
it's
to
the
advantage
of
my
client.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
but
this
is
not
mandatory
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
or
the
door
of
boards
and
commission,
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
made
that
distinction
in
our
opinion,
if
the
court
please,
on
this
reason.
they
say
the
trial
work
demands
instant
decisions
and
your
honor
has
tried
so
many
lawsuits
that
i
think
you
can
understand
the
difference
between
being
before
that
jury,
a
new
question
arising
and
you
must
make
your
decision
like
that,
and
examining
an
abstract
or
drawing
a
contract
and
office
where
you
can
take
two
weeks
if
you
want,
too,
to
look
up
what
the
law
actually
is
on
the
subject
if
you
don't
know.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
your
honor,
any
law
or
most
law,
shall
we
say,
are
enacted
to
cure
a
situation
which
has
come
to
the
attention
of
the
body,
whether
it
be
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
they
pass
a
law
which
forbids
an
act,
which
may
have
been
perfectly
legal
three
months
before.
the
law
makes
it
illegal.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
no.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
think
not,
your
honor.
if
the
body
studying
those
rules
has
studied
them
and
this
legislation,
the
original
legislation
on
this
subject
goes
back
to
1935,
and
has
been
changed
up
until
this
rule
was
promulgated
december
15
of
1958.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
sir?
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
in
1935,
general
statute
7104
was
enacted
by
the
kansas
legislature.
that
applied
to
foreign
attorneys
who
had
not
been
admitted
to
the
bar.
that
was
amended
in
1947.
in
1958,
these
rules
were
adopted.
subsequently,
an
attempt
was
made
in
the
kansas
legislature
to
avoid
the
effect
of
these
court
rules.
a
bill
which
was
presented
to
the
kansas
legislature
is
set
out
in
the
appellee's
brief
in
this
case.
the
legislature
refused
to
enact
that
bill
after
hearings
which
included
testimony
from
trial
court
judges
of
kansas,
as
to
what
the
situations
were
that
these
rules
were
designed
to
prevent.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
not
necessarily
your
honor.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
under
the
constitution
of
kansas
had
the
inherent
part
to
pass
these
rules
regardless
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
of
what
the
legislature
is.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
sir?
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
no.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
other
than
--
excuse
me.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
is
correct
except
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
that
obviously,
the
court
went
on
and
broadened
that,
because
of
its
experience.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
and
those
who
are
not
admitted
to
the
--
not
licensed
to
practice
law
in
kansas,
yes,
sir?
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
a
question
to
mr.
payne
about
the
difficulty
of
securing
attendance
of
counsel.
and
mr.
payne
answered
that
the
missouri
employers
were
not
dilatory.
i've
placed
no
as
such
blame
on
the
man
because
he
practices
in
missouri
at
all.
but
you
have
the
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
of
a
man
with
two
masters.
he
maintains
most
of
this
group
now.
there
are
only
a
few
within
this
group
of
300
who
go
through
the
pretence
of
maintaining
the
law
in
kansas.
the
rest
of
them
had
only
one
office.
they
are
in
missouri
during
all
regular
office
hours.
and
when
there
is
conflict
between
a
setting
in
the
circuit
court
of
jackson
county
missouri
or
a
setting
in
the
district
court
of
wyandotte
or
johnson
county,
kansas,
the
kansas
court
settle.
our
first
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
judge,
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
before
promulgating
these
rules
studied
these
things,
it's
set
out
in
their
opinion.
they
took
notice
of
it.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
for
this
court
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
to
make
up
its
mind
whether
it
should
or
should
not
take
judicial
notice
of
certifying.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
his
license
is
still
enforced
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes
sir,
he
can
use
it

mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
subjects
to
the
limitation
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
established
in
these
rules.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
if
he
gets
a
lawyer
as
defined
by
statute
who
resides
and
maintains
his
office
in
the
judicial
district
in
which
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
will
answer
that
in
this
manner,
if
the
court
please.
experience
shows
that
kansas
court
has
set
out
in
there,
in
their
opinion
that
too
often,
these
lawyers
who
practiced
regularly
in
missouri,
nebraska,
oklahoma,
or
colorado
came
into
the
courts
of
kansas,
and
to
use
a
colloquialism,
if
your
honor
will
excuse
it,
they
played
it
by
year.
they
regularly
practiced
over
there.
they
were
accustomed
to
the
procedure
over
there,
so
when
they
came
in
to
kansas
court,
they
wouldn't
look
up
to
see
what
the
proper
procedure
was,
but
assume
it
was
the
same
as
their.
and
with
regard
to
this
appellant
if
it
please
your
honor,
while
mr.
payne
says
that
he
is
without
fault,
there
is
no
question
of
any
blemish
on
him.
that,
we
are
here
on
a
motion
to
quash
so
the
facts
submitted,
the
facts
in
well-pleaded
in
his
petition
in
mandamus
are
admitted.
but
there
is
a
kansas
reported
case
in
which
this
appellant
failed.
he
went
up
on
appeal
in
a
criminal
case,
his
client
was
convicted.
he
failed
to
tender
some
motion
to
--
some
evidence
that
has
been
rejected
by
the
trial
court
on
his
motion
for
new
trial.
now,
that's
just
an
oddity
we
have
in
kansas,
but
if
you
don't
do
it,
there
isn't
anything
before
appellate
courts.
he
complained
that
the
trial
court
hadn't
given
an
instruction
to
the
jury.
no
instruction
was
tendered.
now,
i
don't
know
under
the
procedural
law
of
missouri,
if
you
must
present
at
your
motion
for
new
trial,
any
evidence
which
is
excluded
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
and
regularly
practice.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
and
devoted
his
full
time
to
kansas
practice,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
don't
think
you
can
make
it
quite
that
simple,
your
honor.
and
the
question
is
and
i
was
amused
that
the
question
asked
here
before,
is
this
to
be
dealt
with
regard
to
only
keith
martin
or
with
the
group
which
falls
within
the
rules
promulgated
by
the
court.
i
myself
have
had
just
a
little
bit
of
difficulty
in
following
an
appellant's
brief
just
which
we
are
here
with.
at
times,
he
finds
fault
and
says
that
the
group
established
is
unreasonable.
well,
that
would
apply
to
the
entire
group.
and
then
at
other
places
in
his
brief,
he
says,
“well,
maybe
these
rules
are
necessarily
for
some
of
these
fellows,
but
i
am
a
man
of
superior
ability.”
and
he
is,
there's
no
question
about
that.
“and
therefore,
they
should
not
be
applied
to
me.”
well
that,
if
this
court
please,
and
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
set
out
to
establish
a
standard
on
individual
ability,
i
think
that
would
be
first
thing
this
court
would
strike
down.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
no.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
overstate.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
your
honor
is
correct.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
the
only
criterion,
the
only
standard
is
the
regular
practice
of
law
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
in
other
jurisdiction
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
your
honor
is
correct.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
sir?
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
no,
there
is
a
statutory
definition
that
goes
back
behind
that,
your
honor,
in
7104,
that
the
local
counsel
must
both
reside
and
maintain
his
office
and
i
think
that
has
been
extruded
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
--
his
sole
office
in
the
judicial
district
--
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
i
think
that
has
been
so
construed.
and
i
think
that
mr.
martin
in
his
brief
admitted
that
in
substance,
he
was
not
authorized
to
local
--
to
serve
as
local
counsel
under
that
rule,
under
that
statute.
the
statute
itself
does
not
use
that
word,
but,
i
think
that
the
appellant
himself
has
taken
the
position
that
that
cannot
be.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
there
is
statute
which
is
pointed
on
in
my
brief,
60
days,
3825
of
the
1949
general
statutes
which
goes
back
in
substantially
its
present
form
to
1923,
your
honor,
which
gives
the
supreme
court,
the
power
to
make
and
amend
rules
or
itself
and
all
inferior
courts.
i
see
my
time
has
expired,
gentlemen.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
sir?
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
rules
are
(voice
overlap),
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
donald
lysaught
yes,
sir.
i
think
so.
