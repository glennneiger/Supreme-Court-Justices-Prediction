when
you
say
rules
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
referred
“the
rules”
that's
the
question
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you
a
while
ago,
you
referred
to
nothing
except
the
schedule
taken
by
the
private
bar
association
or
the
public,
whichever
one
you
want
to
call
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
which
has
no
legal
sanctions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
the
same
effect
as
i
understand
as
a
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
fees
do
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
that
i
assume,
at
least
it's
been
my
observation
about
minimum
fees,
that
if
you
go
to
approve
a
fee
before
a
court,
what
is
a
reasonable
fee,
and
you
have
a
standard
of
that
kind
fixed
by
the
bar,
i
assume
that
would
rarely
ever
be
a
fee
fixed
below
the
minimum.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
practice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
is
--
that
is
the
practice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
he
is
required
to
hire
and
he
did
not
fix
a
fee,
that
would
have
to
be
cut
out
on
the
basis
of
--
you
have
a
quantum
myriad
action
there,
they
call
it
action
for
the
value
of
the
services?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
that
case,
lawyers
testified
to
what
is
the
reasonable
fee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
the
judge
would
rarely
ever
fix
a
fee
as
below
the
minimum,
that's
the
reason
(voice

--
justice
hugo

but
there's
no
law
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
something
like
a
minimum
wage
fixed
by
labor
unions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
definition
yet
by
your
court
of
what
is
meant
by

in
the
practice
of
law
in
another
state?

practice

justice

so
far
as
your
client
is
concerned,
is
he
regularly
engaged
in
the
practice
of
both
states,
does
he
have
an
office
in
both
states?
justice
hugo

black
although
he
resides
--
he
resides
in
kansas
and
has
a
citizenship
and
voting
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
why
you
emphasize
the
fact
that
this
law
was
passed,
the
rule
that
was
promulgated
by
your
court,
whichever
you
would
say,
after
he
went
into
the
practice
in
both
states,
why,
what
do
you
think
that
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
weight
would
that
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it
have
to
be
both,
why
couldn't
both
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
one
--
i
don't
understand
why
you
have
to
choose
between
them,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
meant
was
that
--
i
don't
see
why
there's
a
which,
if
one
could
do
it,
i
suppose
the
other
could
do
it,
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
but
he's
asking
you
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
he
could,
and
i
frankly
do
not
see
why
it
couldn't,
if
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
give
us
the
history
of
this
rule
or
if
it
was
a
law,
a
statute
passed,
if
you
have
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume,
it
seems
to
me
like
it's
being
argued
on
reasons
that
probably
not
the
main
reasons,
and
i
don't
see
why
the
main
reason
shouldn't
be
presented,
lawyers
and
their
fee
--
and
it
might
be
that
the
state
would
be
interested
in
their
fees
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
preserving
their
right
to
get
their
part
of
representation.
who
backed
this
movement
before
it
was
–
rule
was
promulgated,
who
asked
for
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
that
--
if
they
have
motive
of
lawyers
to
do
something,
it
would
necessary
to
invalidate
your
law,
but
i
was
asking
because
i
think
i've
noticed
recently
that
there
are
quite
a
number
of
places
where
the
lawyers
have
been
backing
movements
of
this
kind,
i
think
right
here,
and
in
the
city
of
washington.
with
reference
to
having
people
register
or
not
register,
but
divide
up
their
fees,
which
is
a
very
understandable
motive
or
desire
on
the
part
of
the
bar.
but
it's
not
limited,
is
it,
to
your
section
on
the
contrary,
this
kind
of
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
justice
hugo

what
is
it
they
can
have?
justice
hugo

that
sometimes
happened
in

reference

the

rules

justice
hugo

i
thought
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
shy
away
from
the
argument
that
the
state
could
classify,
make
a
classification
in
order
to
protect
its
lawyers
and
their
rights
to
fees,
on
the
basis
that
that's
not
in
the
case
because
you
think
the
others
found
them.
the
rules
of
referenced
to
--
or
the
standards
used
in
determining
what
denies
equal
protection,
are
pretty
broad.

am
not
saying
that
that
wouldn't

(voice

wouldn't
be
a
denial,
but
--
justice
hugo

suppose
they
extend
it
to
the
county,
i
suppose,
there's
ample
reason
to
believe
that
if
the
man
being
tried
for
defense
in
a
county
a
hundred
miles
away
from
a
good
lawyer
of
his
own
county,
said
they'll
get
a
better
jury
trial
and
a
better
trial
as
a
whole,
if
they'd
get
a
man
located
--
local
man,
wouldn't
it?
has
this
been
extended
to
the
county?
justice
hugo

yes,
that's
frequently
(voice

i
agree
with
you.
justice

was
there
legislation?

had
there

this

had
hired

for

procedure,
is

not?
justice

for
the
regulation

procedure

in

court.

you're
citing
here
