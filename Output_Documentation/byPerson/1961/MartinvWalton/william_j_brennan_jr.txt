justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
payne,
have
you
any
comment
on
the
ground
taken
by
your
supreme
court
that
it
was
difficult
often
in
connection
with
the
processing
of
cases
or
appearances
before
a
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
secure
the
attendance
of
these
lawyers
who
also
had
offices
in
the
missouri
side?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
this
doesn't
go
to
the
competency,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
rather
administration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
take
that
the
posture
of
the
cases
before
us,
we
have
to
take
this
finding
of
your
supreme
court,
do
you
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know.
what
is
this
based
on
some
evidence
that
was
taken
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lysaught?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that
your
supreme
court,
in
the
opinion
said
and
gave
reasons
why,
at
least,
in
conclusion,
that
it
had
power
to
promulgating
this
rule,
constitutional
power.
but
apart
from
that,
is
there
any
special
rule
with
less
than
the
supreme
court,
powers
of
administration
of
the
judicial
grist
in
the
lower
courts
of
kansas?
