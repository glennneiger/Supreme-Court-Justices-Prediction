mr.
howard
e.
payne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
this
appeal,
presenting
a
matter
involving
an
attorney
admitted
to
the
bar
of
the
state
of
kansas
and
the
question
that
is
presented
to
the
court
is
whether
or
not
under
the
due
process
and
the
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
may
an
attorney
who
has
been
regularly
admitted
to
practice
in
the
state
of
his
residence,
in
this
instance,
kansas.
and
who
also
maintains
an
office
and
in
active
practice
in
that
state
since
the
date
of
his
admission
be
denied
by
a
subsequently
promulgated
court
rules
the
right
to
appear
as
counsel
in
the
courts
of
kansas
and
the
boards
and
commissions
of
that
state
unless
he
associates
with
him,
a
local
lawyer,
a
local
kansas
lawyer.
the
same
as
if
he
were
a
nonresident,
non-admitted
attorney
for
the
sole
reason
that
mr.
martin,
the
appellant
in
this
case,
in
addition
to
maintaining
an
office
and
a
practice
and
being
admitted
to
the
kansas
bar,
also
maintains
an
office
and
a
practice
in
the
sister
state
of
missouri.
that
is
essentially
the
question
which
we
have
here
before
the
court
today.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
he
is
a
citizen,
your
honor,
a
resident
of
kansas,
and
maintains
an
office
in
kansas.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
and
lives
in
kansas,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
the
missouri
bar
as
according
to
the
judicial
findings
of
our
supreme
court,
is
approximately
1800.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
no,
in
the
kansas
city
--
kansas
city
missouri
bar.
the
whole
state,
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
it
applies
to
mr.
martin
practicing
anywhere
within
any
other
state
so
long
as
he
maintains
an
office
in
kansas,
our
court
has
said
that
if
he
practices
in
a
foreign
state
also,
then
he
must
associate
with
him
when
he
practices
in
kansas,
a
local
lawyer
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
in
the
whole
state
of
missouri?
mr.
howard
e.
payne
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
i
think
that
probably
within
the
so-called
classification
that
is
affected
by
these
rules,
there
are
approximately
25
to
40
lawyers
who
reside
in
kansas,
who
maintain
an
office
in
kansas
and
who
are
admitted
to
the
bar
in
kansas,
but
who
also
practiced
over
in
kansas
city,
missouri
or
in
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
it
would
be
25
to
40.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
25
to
40,
who
are
affected
by
these
rules
so
far
as
the
area
that
we
are
concerned
about
is
concerned.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
probably,
if
your
honor,
if
the
court
rather
understood
the
geographics
of
this
thing,
primarily,
this
situation
arose
because
of
johnson
county
kansas
having
a
largely
residential
population
and
having
about
90
members
of
the
bar
at
johnson
county,
wyandotte
county,
kansas,
which
adjoins
johnson
county,
having
approximately
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
having
approximately
all
400
or
500
members
of
the
bar,
and
then
over
across
to
the
east
of
the
state
line
is
jackson
county,
missouri
and
that
is
where
kansas
city,
missouri
is
located,
and
there
is
approximately
1800
lawyers
in
jackson
county,
missouri
or
kansas
city,
missouri.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
in
the
rules?
mr.
howard
e.
payne
not
in
the
rules
adopted,
your
honor,
by
the
supreme
court.
but
each
of
the
local
bar
associations,
the
wyandotte
county
bar
and
the
johnson
county
bar,
and
probably
through
as
far
as
jackson
county,
although
we
need
not
necessarily
be
concerned
about
that,
but
johnson
county
and
wyandotte
county
have
local
rules
with
regards
to
fees
varying
from
one-third
to
50%.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well
that
is
the
rule,
but
actually
i
think
most
of
the
counsel,
most
of
the
attorneys
are
guided
more
or
less
by
the
canons
adopted
by
the
american
bar
association,
in
other
words
it
is
not
an
inflexible
thing.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
the
american
bar
association
rules,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
yes,
and
i
think
that
is
predicated
upon
the
--
or
time
consumed
in
the
extent
of
the
services
and
value
of
the
services
that
may
have
been
rendered.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
that
--
that
is
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
not
actually,
of
course,
it
depends
upon
the
circumstances
and
the
lawyer
involved.
but
if
a
lawyer,
a
local
counsel
so-called,
insisted
that
he
be
paid
a
minimum
fee
as
adopted
by
the
standard
or
by
the
local
bar
committee,
i
suppose
there
would
be
matter
of
negotiation
between
he
and
the
so-called
foreign
attorney.
but
he
could
insist
and
probably,
the
courts
would
require
the
payment.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
all
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
i
know
there
was
some
testimony
to
that
effect
given
by
my
client
in
the
hearing
in
the
taylor
versus
taylor
case.
but
actually
no
lawyer
who
is
compelled
to
hire
a
local
lawyer
expects
a
local
lawyer
to
sit
there
and
incidentally,
i
would
say
to
the
court
now,
that
when
i
talk
about
a
local
lawyer
being
associated,
i
do
not
mean
a
lawyer
who
merely
signs
the
pleadings
in
the
clerk's
office,
and
then
goes
back
to
his
office.
under
these
rules,
that
local
lawyer,
if
a
case
takes
a
day
or
10
days,
must
be
in
constant
presence
of
the
court
in
the
court
room,
and
not
back
at
his
office.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
pardon
me,
sir.
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
not,
not
as
far
as
fees
is
concerned.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
no.
your
honors,
here
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
--
here
is
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
here
is
our
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
of
course,
actually
the
fees
that
are
fixed
by
the
local
bar
associations
of
the
kansas
counties,
do
not
have
any
reference
to
fees
that
are
charged
over
in
missouri,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
correctly.
but
it
is
only
in
those
instances
where
a
so-called
foreign
lawyer
that
is,
let's
say
a
missouri
lawyer,
comes
over
into
kansas
and
under
the
rules
is
compelled
to
hire
in
association
in
that
lawsuit
a
kansas
lawyer.
then
under
the
rules
of
the
county
in
which
he
--
this
litigation
is
pending,
he
must
pay
to
the
local
counsel
a
fee.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
the
bar
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
the
bar
associations
of
each
of
the
two
counties
that
we're
talking
about,
wyandotte
and
johnson.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
it
has
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
it's
never
been
tested,
your
honor.
no
one
has
ever
attempted
to
say
that
they
could
or
could
not.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
which
is
an
ordinary
thing,
i
think,
among
many
of
the
local
bar
associations
through
--
not
only
kansas,
but
other
states.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
i
will
agree
with
your
honor
on
that
statement.
but
nonetheless,
there
are
in
the
two
counties
involved
and
in
most
counties,
i
believe,
a
local
schedule
of
minimum
fees.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly.
if
a
so-called
foreign
lawyer
is
compelled
in
this
instance,
it's
mr.
martin,
the
appellant
here,
who
as
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court,
ought
not
be
characterized
as
a
foreign
lawyer.
but
if
he
hires
a
local
attorney
and
he's
required
to
do
it
under
the
present
rules,
he
of
course
becomes
obligated
to
remunerate
that
local
attorney,
he
could
not
expect
a
local
lawyer
to
even
just
sit,
as
your
honor
has
suggested,
and
not
be
paid.
now,
how
much
he
ought
to
be
paid
is
of
course
regulated
so
far
as
the
regulation
can
go
by
the
minimum
schedule
of
fees
adopted
by
the
local
bar
association.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
minimum
fee?
mr.
howard
e.
payne
no,
none
that
i
know
off,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
no,
sir.
it
is
a
suggested
minimum
and
of
course
some
lawyers
exact
it,
if
that
is
the
proper
term,
and
others
negotiate
with
the
foreign
--
so-called
foreign
lawyer,
and
say,
“well,
i've
been
here
two
days
and
my
service
is
worth
$150
a
day,”
it
is
not
an
exact
thing,
it
is
only
a
suggestion
of
minimum
fee.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
but
in
any
event,
there
is
of
course
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
foreign
lawyer
to
pay
a
local
lawyer
for
his
time.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
yes,
your
honor.
go
ahead.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well
of
course,
i
would
not
want
to
speculate
your
honor,
about
that,
it
has
never
occurred,
and
i
hope
that
it
never
does.
but
i
suppose,
as
i
suggested
a
while
ago,
that
if
the
local
lawyer
said
to
the
so-called
foreign
lawyer,
now
we
have
adopted
a
minimum
fee
schedule
here
in
johnson
county
or
wyandotte
county
or
in
doniphan
county
or
wherever
it
is.
and
if
i
associate
with
you,
my
fee
will
be
the
minimum
of
a
third
or
50%,
i
suppose
that
the
foreign
lawyer
would
have
no
alternative,
if
he
wanted
that
lawyer
other
than
to
--
and
of
course
the
local
lawyer
would
be
as
far
as
the
schedule
is
concerned,
would
be
within
his
rights
in
saying
that.
now,
whether
our
supreme
court
would
say
that
was
exacting
tribute
rather
than
compensation,
i
would
not
argue.
now,
if
the
court
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
i
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
your
honor,
i
hope
we're
not
confused
on
the
rules
with
regarding
fees
and
the
rules
that
are
in
controversy
in
this
case.
now
the
rules
that
we
challenge
in
this
case
is
not
the
local
bar
rules
with
regards
to
fees,
the
rules
that
we
challenge
here
are
rules
which
we're
adopted
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
december
of
1958.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
and
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
that
is
correct,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
that's
in
practice.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
in
practice,
your
honor
is
correct
about
that.
i
believe
that
can
be
said
as
true.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
value
of
the
services
rendered.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
that's
correct.
that
frequently
happens
in
matters
of
all
probative
states
and
things
of
that
kind
that
the
lawyers
are
called
upon
to
give
expert
testimonies
to
the
value
of
services
rendered
to
the
administrator
or
the
executor
state.
but
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor
is
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
most
of
the
local
judges
are
cognizant
of
the
fees
that
are
fixed
by
the
local
bar
association
and
in
most
instances
with
their
approval
or
at
least
pass
an
approval
and
sanction
and
so
they
don't
ordinarily
go
below.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
yes
sir.
but
the
thing
which
i
am
not
so
much
concerned
myself,
at
least,
with
the
fee
proposition,
although
that
is
important
in
this
case.
is
that
in
1958,
december
the
15th,
i
believe
it
was
in
1958
or
about
10
years,
after
the
appellant
in
this
case
had
been
admitted
to
practice
in
kansas
and
had
practiced
in
kansas
incidentally
for
all
of
that
period
of
time.
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
amended
certain
rules,
rules
designated
in
the
brief
as
rule
41
and
rule
54.
now,
in
the
amendment
of
those
rules,
the
effect
of
it
was
that
any
lawyer
although
admitted
to
the
bar
in
the
state
of
kansas
and
although
residing
in
the
state
of
kansas,
and
although
maintaining
an
office
in
the
state
of
kansas,
if
he
also
engaged
in
practice
of
law
in
another
state
to
which
bar,
he
was
admitted,
then
that
lawyer
that
i'm
talking
about,
and
it's
the
appellant
in
this
case,
must
hire
a
local
lawyer
to
associate
with
him
whenever
he
tries
a
lawsuit
or
appears
before
any
commission
or
tribunal.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
none,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
none,
your
honor
and
i
had
hoped
to
urge
that
upon
this
court,
that
their
--
and
it's
a
little
out
of
context,
but
it
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
difference.
the
term
regularly
engaged
in
the
practice
of
law
is
a
confusing
thing
not
only
to
the
appellant
in
this
case,
but
obviously
to
all
who
would
think
about
the
term.
now,
would
that
mean
that
if
mr.
martin
tried
two
cases
a
year,
or
ten
cases
a
year
in
missouri
under
his
missouri
license,
that
a
court
would
say
that
he
was
regularly
engaged
in
the
practice
of
law,
that
is
one
of
the
imponderables
of
this
rule
and
we
think
for
reason
of
being
so
indefinite
and
ambiguous
and
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
--
none
of
certain
of
ascertainment
that
it
ought
to
vitiate
and
strike
down
these
rules
that
have
been
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
--
adopted
by
the
court.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
my
client
has
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
my
client
resides
in
kansas,
he
maintains
a
law
office
in
kansas,
he
practices
in
kansas,
and
had
for
10
years
prior
to
the
promulgation
of
these
rules.
now,
he
also
maintains
an
office
or
in
the
state
of
missouri,
which
is
only
six
to
eight
miles
from
where
he
lives.
he
lives
at
mission,
kansas
and
kansas
city,
missouri
and
he
maintains
an
office
in
the
bryant
building
over
there,
a
matter
of
six
or
eight
miles
to
go
to
his
office
over
there.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
from
where
lives.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
in
this
respect,
your
honor,
for
10
years
at
least,
for
10
years
from
1940
to
1950,
if
these
rules
have
any
basis
at
all,
it
must
--
a
necessity
be
predicated
upon
the
competency
of
the
lawyer
in
an
attempt
to
make
lawyers
more
competent
in
kansas.
now,
for
10
years,
there
was
no
question
with
regards
to
the
competency
of
the
qualifications
of
my
client
mr.
martin
to
practice
law
in
kansas.
and
then
almost
overnight,
mr.
martin
by
the
promulgation
of
these
rules,
and
law
was
placed
in
the
same
category
as
in
lawyer
who
had
no
license
to
practice
in
kansas
who
had
no
residence
in
kansas,
and
who
had
no
office
in
kansas,
he
was
placed
in
that
same
category.
and
i
say
in
the
brief
i'm
--
that
i
have
left
that
when
they
do
that,
take
away
the
competency
and
the
qualification
after
10
years
of
no
complaint
about,
and
indeed,
there
isn't
any
complaint
in
anywhere
here
about
mr.
martin's
competency.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
and
says
on
page
2,
as
to
his
professional
qualifications
and
his
personal
character,
there
is
no
question.
but
when
they
take
it
away
your
honor,
in
that
fashion
and
manner,
that
is
the
thing
that
forms
the
basis
for
much
of
the
appellant's
complaint.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
very
well.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
very
well.
well,
as
i
have
said
to
the
court
previously,
they
are
saying
that
we
are
complaining
about
here
is
that
the
court
passed
these
rules
and
disqualified
or
put
mr.
martin
in
a
classification
that
we
think
is
not
real
nor
not
warranted.
and
what
i
have
said
about
mr.
martin
would
go
to
those
other
attorneys
if
i
may
speak
briefly
upon
classification
in
the
little
time
that
i
have
left
here.
i
think
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
you
cannot
have
a
wholly
arbitrary
standard
or
a
consideration
that
offends
the
dictates
of
reason
and
that
there
must
be
some
rational
connection
with
a
person's
fitness
and
capacity
to
practice
law.
now,
weighing
these
rules
in
the
light
of
those
general
statements
that
has
governed
this
court
in
other
decisions,
surely
it
cannot
be
said
that
after
all
of
the
years
of
practice
that
mr.
martin
either
had
the
privilege
or
the
right
to
indulge
in,
and
i'm
not
so
concerned
about
that,
surely
can
it
be
said
that
now
simply
because
mr.
martin
continuing
in
the
same
method
and
mode
that
he
followed
previously
also
engages
in
the
practice
of
law
in
the
state
of
missouri
has
now
become
incapacitated,
incompetent,
or
not
qualified
to
practice
law
in
kansas
without
being
associated.
and
having
associated
with
him
a
local
lawyer
with
all
of
the
incidents
of
pay
or
economics
or
whatever
may
be
concerned
with
that.
we
think
that
any
classification,
mr.
martin
upon
that
score
is
an
unreal
thing
and
of
course,
it
not
only
offends
the
dictates
of
reason
but
it
is
an
unsubstantial
and
not
a
logical
classification.
to
say
that
here
is
a
kansas
lawyer
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
even
being
a
local
lawyer
that
is
as
to
admission
of
the
bar,
residency,
and
maintenance
of
an
office,
and
to
say
now,
he's
different,
he
is
different,
and
he
has
counsel
in
this
case
and
i
practice
only
in
johnson
county,
except
occasionally,
that
he
is
different
now
than
his
counsel
merely
because
he
goes
two
or
three
miles
over
into
the
state
of
missouri,
where
his
office
is
located
in
kansas
goes
over
two
or
three
miles
into
the
state
of
missouri
and
practices
law
over
there.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well
of
course,
i
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
no.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
it
goes
to
the
administration
of
the
courts,
of
course,
i
never
--
in
no
event
could
apply
it
to
the
appellant
in
this
case
for
the
reason
that
he
has
got
an
office,
he's
a
member
of
the
kansas
bar,
and
he
actually
practices
over
in
the
state
of
kansas,
in
the
courts
of
that
state.
now,
a
personal
observation,
pardon
me,
personal
reference,
i
have
practiced
adjacent
to
kansas
city,
missouri,
and
the
missouri
lawyers
for
35
years.
i
have
never
known
the
missouri
bar
or
attorneys
in
the
state
of
missouri
to
be
more
dilatory
and
recreating
their
attendance
upon
the
court
than
many
kansas
lawyers.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
well,
if
it
is
based
upon
something
substantial
and
reasonable.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
no,
it
was
based
upon
the
judicial
finding,
taking
judicial
notice
they
have
said
of
that,
and
some
--
there
is
no
evidence
taken
in
the
case
your
honor,
but
in
any
event,
they
do
not
ascribe
any
of
those
things
that
are
spelled
out
by
what
your
honor
has
mentioned.
they
do
not
ascribe
any
of
those
things
to
the
appellant
in
this
case,
mr.
martin.
there
is
no
indication
at
all,
either
in
judicial
notice
of
the
court
or
in
any
testimony
or
on
the
record,
anywhere
that
mr.
martin
has
ever
failed
to
respond
to
the
call
of
the
docket
of
the
court
in
kansas
or
otherwise.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
he
is
still
a
member
of
course
of
the
kansas
bar
on
any
malfeasance
or
misfeasance
on
the
part
of
mr.
martin
would
be
subject
to
disciplinary
action
or
to
disbarment.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
should
it
be
decided
solely
upon
his
status,
your
honor?
mr.
howard
e.
payne
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
of
course
--
mr.
howard
e.
payne
of
course,
the
court
has
said,
i
think
in
probably
some
of
the
dissents
involving
some
of
these
lawyer
cases
that
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
factual
situation
with
regard
to
that
particular
individual
in
determining
whether
or
not
his
constitutional
rights
had
been
violated.
but
actually
your
honor,
this
case
does
go
far
beyond
just
mr.
martin.
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
payne
if
the
court
could
do
this,
go
this
far
with
these
rules,
then
of
course,
how
far
more
can
they
go?
that's
it.
thank
you.
