justice
felix
frankfurter
your
reference
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
subsequently
promulgated
regulation
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
statute,
leads
me
to
ask,
approximately
what
is
the
size
of
the
missouri
bar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
applied
to
the
whole
state,
does
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
get
the
incidence
of
this
statute
or
regulation.
for
the
whole
state,
you
have
given
out,
i
guess,
the
size
of
the
bar,
roughly
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
the
18
--
within
the
immediately
affected
area,
out
of
the
18,
how
many
have
a
practice
both
in
kansas
and
in
missouri?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
hitting
or
suggesting
that
numbers
make
the
difference,
i
was
just
curious
to
know
how
many
lawyers
are
affected
by
this
--
by
this
restrictive
provision?
you
know,
out
of
15
or
20,
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
25,
30
to
40.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
where
--
where
the
shoe
pinches
most,
doesn’t
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
payne,
i
know
awfully
a
little
about
being
–
never
had
any
roughly
speaking,
i
don't
understand
how
private
arrangement
within
the
bar
of
kansas
can
determine
the
fees
enforceable
in
missouri
practice,
i
don't
understand
that,
except
by
agreement
of
party,
sure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
this
involves
missouri
practice,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
a
missouri
lawyer
must
associate
himself
with
a
--
that
a
kansas
--
who
has
office
in
both
states,
can't
practice
in
kansas
without
associating
himself
with
a
missouri
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
what
i
thought,
but
i
was
corrected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
i
do
not
see
how
the
internal
agreement
among
the
bar
association
of
one
state
can
affect
legal
business
done
in
another
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that
is
by
arrangement
within
the
bar
association.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
governing
--
is
that
--
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
does
that
bind
your
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
sustaining
those
fees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
point
is
that
if
association
of
a
local
lawyer
for
nominal
reasons,
does
that
follow
that
your
supreme
court
will
also
say
that
if
a
fellow
says,
“yes,
i'll
hire
a
kansas
lawyer
to
sit
there
or
sign
his
name,
but
do
nothing,”
it
is
a
coercive,
an
unfairly
coercive
thing
for
me
to
be
influenced
by
or
guided
by
the
local
fees
which
implied
fees
for
doing
business
and
not
merely
phenomenal
requirement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
that
our
problem
isn't
tied
to
the
necessity
of
assuming
that
this
fee
scheme
also
follows
from
sustaining
this
promulgated
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
everything
you
said
except
the
last
sentence.
i
do
--
do
not
think
--
i
do
not
think
until
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
says
that
any
service,
any
service
falls
within
this
minimum
fee
scheme
of
the
two
counties
in
question,
any
service,
the
most
nominally
subject
to
it
until
that
is
done,
i
do
not
think
i
have
to
read
this
promulgation
as
assimilating
the
fee
scheme
of
these
two
counties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
one
more
question,
real
quick.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
your
client
comes
into
kansas
to
practice
law
as
he
could,
at
least,
and
under
this
regulation
he
has
to
retain
somebody.
suppose
everybody
recognizes
that
he
is
such
a
master
of
a
particular
litigation
in
question,
if
he
doesn't
need
any
assistant,
he
has
to
comply
with
the
law.
but
he
says,
“i
will
retain
you,
but
not
for
the
minimum
fee.”
and
no
lawyer
in
kansas,
in
either
of
these
counties,
is
ready
to
associate
himself
on
that
basis.
and
he
then
goes
before
your
court
and
said,
“i've
done
my
best
to
comply
with
your
rule,”
but
no
lawyer
will
serve
you
except
on
the
basis
of
an
extortion
of
the
fee,
what
would
your
supreme
court
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
payne.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
case
should
be
dealt
with
or
decided
with
reference
to
the
particular
honorific
facts
relating
to
mr.
martin,
as
though
we
had
the
individual
case
of
mr.
martin
before
us,
a
case
that
you
picture,
a
case
to
fake
hardship
or
unfairness,
colloquialism,
or
call
it
of
what
you
will?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
his
status,
but
his
--
his
special
circumstances?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
naturally
taking
a
very
flagrant
case
properly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lysaught.
justice
felix

this
(inaudible)

justice

well,
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
factors
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
these
rules
derived
from
--
or
justified
as
based
on
or
authorized
by
the
47
statute,
weren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
could
they
--
could
your
supreme
court
--
your
supreme
court
--
is
this
the
subject
matter
as
to
which
legislation
could
control?
justice

but
if
you
take
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
rules
were
in
conflict
with
the
47
statute,
did
it?
justice
felix

it
did
not
think
that
its
rules
went
beyond
or
in
conflict
with
the
47
statute.
justice

let's
move
on,
by
foreign
lawyers
and
the
47th
statute,
did
they
mean
french

an
english
barrister?
