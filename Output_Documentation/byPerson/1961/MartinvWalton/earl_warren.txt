must

chief

not

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
payne,
we've
taken
most
of
your
time
answering
questions.
i'm
going
to
give
you
five
more
minutes
to
make
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
of
course,
i'll
give
the
other
side,
equal
amount
of
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
finish
your
--
finish
your
thought.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lysaught.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
number?
chief
justice
earl
warren
300.
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
the
statute,
what
is
the
standard
for
regular
practice
in
another
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
standard
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
are
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
isn't
the
question
i
was
asking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
required
--
this
practice
in
the
foreign
state
to
constitute
practice
there
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
much
of
that
work
do
they
have
to
do
in
the
foreign
state
to
bring
themselves
--
to
be
brought
under
this
rule?
now,
as
i
understood
mr.
payne,
he
said
that
he
occasionally
tries
a
case
over
in
missouri.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
say
whether
he
had
an
office
or
not,
but
he
said
he
occasionally
tried
a
case
over
there.
now,
does
he
have
to
just
because
of
that,
does
he
have
to
acquire
a
kansas
lawyer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
now,
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
what
is
the
standard
under
this
law
that
defines
regularly
engaged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
pretty
vague?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
doesn't
say
that
if
he
maintains
his
principal
place
of
business
or
if
he
has
a
regular
place
of
business
or
anything
else,
if
he
just
practices
over
there,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
lives
on
half-a-mile
on
the
kansas
side
of
the
line,
and
his
clients
have
some
business
over
in
missouri,
he
maintains
his
office
in
kansas
but
his
clients
have
business
over
in
missouri
quite
regularly
and
he
goes
over
there
to
take
care
of
them,
then
he
loses
his
right
to
practice
freely
in
kansas,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
what
i'm
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
and,
do
you
have
to
associate
anyone
in
kansas
with
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well,
i
understand
that,
but
really
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out
is
if
there
is
any
standard
at
all
to
determine
what
is
meant
by
regularly
practicing
over
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
requirement
for
a
foreign
lawyer
who
has
no
connection
with
the
state
of
kansas
when
he
comes
into
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
no,
i
mean
for
a
specific
piece
of
business.
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
can
he
do
it
by
--
can
he
do
it
by
doing
the
same
thing
that
this
lawyer
does
by
associating
with
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
can?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
make
no
distinction
then
between
foreign
lawyers
and
lawyers
who
are
admitted
to
practice
in
kansas
and
who
operate
as
this
practitioner
does.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
put
them
all
on
the
same
basis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
what
i
saw,
do
you
--
you're
admitted
to
practice
in
both
states,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
kansas
and
missouri.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
are
not
associated
--
you're
not
admitted
to
practice,
you
would
have
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
in
any
circumstances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
couldn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lysaught.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
47
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
it
wouldn't
appear
to
have
any
bearing
on
this
case
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
because
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
foreign
lawyers
and
they
have
no
right
to
come
in
to
your
state
and
practice
law
at
all.
so,
that
wouldn't
hardly
bear
on
this
subject,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
question
was
asked
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they'd
be
in
the
same
position,
wouldn't
they,
before
your
courts?
they
wouldn't
have
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
