mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
is
a
private
action
under
the
antitrust
laws,
that
was
tried
in
the
district
court
in
san
francisco
before
a
jury.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
defendant
and
the
court
ended
its
judgement
on
that
verdict.
we
contended
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
that
verdict
was
the
product
of
manifest
errors
that
had
certainly
been
manifested
by
the
time
the
court
got
to
the
--
the
time
the
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals.
notably,
the
defendants
in
that
case,
the
respondents
here,
had
gambled
and
lost
on
what
this
court
was
going
to
do
in
the
klor
case.
may
i
ask
the
court
to
give
the
klor
instruction
at
time
that
that
case
was
before
the
ninth
circuit?
addition
to
that,
when
we
asked
the
trial
judge
to
give
the
bigelow
instruction,
the
trial
judge
stated
in
all
seriousness
that
somebody
has
to
start
reversing
the
supreme
court
and
he
didn't
propose
to
give
the
bigelow
instruction
because
he
didn't
agree
with.
he
thought
that
the
--
a
more
stringent
rule
should
apply
in
antitrust
cases
and
even
in
most
cases
with
respect
to
the
measurement
of
the
damages.
in
addition
to
that,
the
court
held
that
the
respondents
here,
acting
through
a
canadian
subsidiary,
have
a
right
to
eliminate
the
petitioners
from
their
canadian
business
to
takeaway
their
canadian
business
entirely
because
the
subsidiary
of
the
respondents
was
acting
as
a
purchaser
under
authority
of
the
canadian
government,
and
it
was
felt
that
the
american
banana
doctrine
in
some
way
permitted
them
to
do
this
with
impunity.
in
this
posture
of
the
case,
the
court
of
appeals
completely
avoiding
--
avoided
having
to
meet
this
problem
by
stating
that
it
would
consider
all
of
the
evidence
even
that
that
was
excluded
under
the
american
banana
theory.
but
that
taking
all
of
the
evidence
in
its
best
like,
it
felt
that
it
would
grant
the
conspiracy
to
monopolize
had
been
proved
and
grant
there
was
economic
evidence
in
the
case,
relevant
economic
data
to
justify
a
measurement
of
damages,
and
grant
there
was
a
failure
here
of
petitioners
to
get
a
foothold
in
this
business,
that
with
all
of
that
the
evidence
didn't
establish
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
could
have
gone
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
respondents
had
caused
this
failure.
and
so,
it
said
on
that
basis
that
since
there
was
no
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
legal
causation
that
it
didn't
have
to
consider
the
manifest
errors
that
were
in
this
record.
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
the
questions
we
are
here
to
discuss
is
whether
or
not
under
the
circumstances
where
a
violation
and
a
rather
flagrant
violation
as
in
this
case
is
admitted
and
where
the
respondents
in
this
case
directly
said
that
they
intended
to
eliminate
these
petitioners
and
to
prevent
them
from
getting
a
foothold
in
this
industry,
there
was
direct
evidence
on
that,
when
that
is
the
situation
whether
the
court
can
takeaway
from
a
jury
the
question
of
legal
causation.
the
second
question
we
have
here
on
certiorari
is
whether
or
not
the
court
was
correct
in
the
--
in
excluding
the
evidence
predicated
upon
the
american
banana
case
and
third,
whether
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
deprived
these
petitioners
of
a
right
to
trial
by
jury.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
case
went
to
the
jury
and
the
verdict
was
in
favor
of
the
respondents
in
this
court.
we
contended
it
was
the
product
of
these
errors
that
we
had
mentioned.
the
court
of
appeals
avoided
meeting
these
errors
of
all
by
this
device
that
saying
there
was
no
legal
causation.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
would
think
under
the
circumstances
particularly
with
respect
to
the
american
banana
theory
that
was
employed
by
the
court
of
the
case
could
be
sent
down
to
the
district
court
directly.
but
this
i
think
is
an
unresolved
question
under
the
law.
the
closest
we
get
to
that
is
the
story
parchment
situation
where
it
was
contended
that
that
case
should
have
been
sent
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
supreme
court
said
that
under
the
circumstances,
it
had
enough
of
the
record
before
it
to
see
that
there
was
error,
they
couldn't
be
handled
in
that
fashion,
that
it
was
simply
send
it
--
simply
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
send
it
back
to
the
district
court.
now,
the
difference
between
the
cases
is,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
in
the
story
parchment
case,
the
petitioners
won
the
jury
verdict.
in
this
case,
they
lost
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
it
is
a
difference,
if
your
honor
please.
however,
when
you
--
when
you
analyze
what
has
been
done
here,
i
think
it's
perfectly
plain
that
it's
not
necessary
to
send
this
case
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
that
this
court
in
fact
overruled
the
klor
case
and
the
klor
instruction
was
given
in
this
case,
and
it
got
the
series
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
harlan.
you
recall
the
klor
doctrine
as
it
was
being
handled
in
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
you
can
deliberately
eliminate
a
competitor.
but
that,
if
after
you
eliminate
him,
the
public
still
can
be
served
by
what
remains
in
the
industry
that
that
didn't
constitute
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
this
case,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
since
two
respondents
had
100%
of
this
industry,
it
meant
that
they
could
with
impunity
eliminate
a
competitor
so
long
as
they
themselves
still
have
enough
to
serve
the
general
public.
now,
on
the
context
of
this
case,
i
think
it
will
be
an
idle
act
to
send
this
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
go
directly
to
the
district
court.
however,
if
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
it's
clear.
they
would
have
to
say
that
the
klor
case
was
error
and
that
the
trial
court's
contempt
of
this
court
in
its
statement
that
it
didn't
--
it
proposed
to
start
reversing
the
supreme
court
in
refusing
to
give
the
bigelow
doc
--
the
bigelow
instruction
that
in
view
of
that
situation,
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
would
be
more
practical
under
the
circumstances
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court.
now,
when
the
court
of
appeals
decided
if
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
on
causation
to
send
this
case
to
the
jury,
it
still
hadn't
closed
the
entire
gap
because
it
had
the
manifest
elimination
of
the
canadian
business,
a
petitioner's
canadian
business.
and
so,
it
said
with
respect
to
that,
that
since
the
business
was
eliminated
and
since
this
business
was
taken
away
from
petitioners
by
a
subsidiary
of
one
of
respondents
which
was
acting
at
the
time
as
a
purchasing
agent
for
canada,
that
since
that
was
done,
this
court's
decision
in
the
noerr
case
prevented
any
antitrust
liability
from
arising
from
that
set
of
facts.
so,
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
we
respectfully
submit,
was
first
of
all,
take
away
the
case
from
the
jury
when
there
was
manifestly
a
factual
conflict.
and,
secondly,
it
misapplied
this
court's
decision
in
the
noerr
case
to
hold
it
under
no
circumstances
can
a
governmental
agency
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
furthering
the
objectives
of
a
monopoly
as
distinct
from
serving
the
very
purposes
of
the
agency
itself.
now,
after
this
case
came
down
from
the
ninth
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
with
modification
certain
judgements
in
companion
cases.
we
bring
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court
because
i
think
it
supports
our
view
that
manifestly,
there
were
two
inferences,
that
there
was
some
resolutions
of
facts
that
had
to
be
made
by
a
trier
of
the
facts
because
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
in
affirming
the
judgements
in
the
companion
cases
is
inconsistent
with
the
view
that
under
no
circumstances
could
you
find
antitrust
liability
here.
there
was
in
this
case,
and
it's
admitted
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
or
assumed
by
it
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
a
comprehensive
scheme
to
monopolize
every
facet
of
the
vanadium
industry.
the
commodity
involved
was
vanadium-bearing
rock
which
also
contained
uranium
in
the
ratio
of
six
to
one
and
the
locale
of
these
things,
the
locale
of
the
mining
was
on
the
colorado
plateau.
there
were
three
forms
of
the
commodity
involved
in
the
action,
first,
the
ore
itself,
secondly
the
vanadium
oxide
and
third,
the
ferrovanadium.
there
was
direct
evidence,
indeed
a
confession
by
a
former
vice
president
of
the
united
states
vanadium
corporation
that
the
corporations
here
intended
to
monopolize
every
face
of
the
industry
and
they
were
instructed
to
fair
about
competition
wherever
it
might
arise
or
to
determine
what
claims
or
determine
what
business
might
form
the
nucleus
for
a
competitive
operation
and
to
remove
it
and
pursuant
to
this,
they
did.
it
was
a
remarkably
successful
conspiracy
to
monopolize,
resulting
in
100%
of
the
ferrovanadium
industry,
the
respondents
acquiring
90%
of
the
domestic
industry
on
vanadium
oxide,
and
the
respondents
milling
in
their
mills
90%
of
the
ore
from
their
own
properties.
there
is
no
dispute
in
the
evidence
that
the
respondents,
by
simple
agreement,
fixed
the
price
that
they
were
to
pay
to
the
miners
for
the
ore.
there's
no
dispute
in
the
evidence
that
they
fixed
the
price
of
the
vanadium
oxide
and
no
dispute
that
they
fixed
the
price
of
the
ferrovanadium.
there
was
a
division
of
markets
between
them
based
on
percentages
and
based
on
specific
customers.
there
was
an
agreement
not
to
solicit
each
other's
customers.
they
cooperate
in
connection
with
the
exploitation
of
certain
claims
to
the
extent
that
one
respondent
mine
the
claims
of
the
other
respondent,
and
there
was
an
agreement
between
them
that
they
would
eliminate
all
competitive
threats.
now,
so
far
as
these
petitioners
are
concerned,
these
petitioners
or
the
principal
petitioner
involved
here
is
a
man
named
henry
j
leir,
who
came
to
this
country
in
1938
from
germany
and
from
europe
where
it
had
an
extensive
experience
in
connection
with
the
purchase
of
raw
materials
for
manufacturing
ferroalloys.
in
that
european
experience,
he
had
developed
certain
processes
which
produced
a
superior
type
vanadium.
this
all
has
to
be
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
this
--
for
the
purposes
of
the
--
hearing
this
motion.
his
vanadium
contained
approximately
80%
of
the
vanadium
content
of
80%.
in
addition
to
that,
he
had
developed
a
vanadium
oxide
with
certain
other
agents
which
could
be
introduced
directly
into
the
steel
bath.
the
principal
uses
of
vanadium
were
in
the
steel
industry
for
the
purpose
of
toughening
the
product.
so,
he
came
in
1938
and
made
certain
contracts
for
the
production
of
ferrovanadium
in
this
country.
the
evidence
in
the
case
disclosed,
and
this
was
from
a
former
vice
president
of
the
united
states
vanadium
corporation,
that
both
union
carbide
and
the
vanadium
corporation
of
america,
the
two
respondents
in
this
action,
that
both
of
them
directly
intended
to
keep
these
petitioners
from
gaining
any
kind
of
a
position
in
the
vanadium
industry.
the
evidence
on
this
was
direct.
it
is
the
vice
president
of
the
united
states
vanadium
company
admitted
it
and
he
admitted
to
a
conversation
with
the
president
of
the
vanadium
corporation
of
america
when
a
certain
project
was
being
discussed
to
take
uranium
from
the
ore
without
having
the
vanadium
milled
at
the
same
time
and
the
president
of
the
vanadium
corporation
of
america,
one
of
the
respondents,
says
that
that
would
permit
this
petitioner
to
get
into
business,
and
this
is
exactly
what
we
have
been
trying
to
prevent.
the
evidence
discloses,
too.
a
joint
refusal
by
these
folks
who
have
100%
of
the
ferrovanadium
industry
and
90%
of
the
vanadium
oxide
industry,
a
joint
refusal
to
deal
to
petitioner
or
to
sell
to
petitioner
and
this,
in
times
when
burdening
circumstances
were
being
handled
by
both
organizations.
in
addition
to
that,
they
interfered
with
his
source
of
supply,
one
of
the
millers
on
the
colorado
plateau,
named
nisley
&
wilson.
now,
since
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
has
affirmed
a
judgement
in
favor
of
nisley
&
wilson
and
that
judgement
had
implicit
in
it
the
fact
that
they
were
eliminated
by
these
respondents
pursuant
to
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
the
industry.
nisley
&
wilson,
as
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
discloses
for
the
chief
source
of
supply
for
these
petitioners.
so,
it
was
found
by
the
jury
in
salt
lake
and
affirmed
by
the
court
in
denver
that
they
had
been
eliminated
and
there
were
sufficient
facts
to
sustain
that
judgement.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that
was
a
private
antitrust
action
by
nisley
&
wilson
and
the
private
antitrust
action
also
by
the
miners
resulted
in
a
judgement
for
the
miners,
which
even
upon
modifications
for
something
like
$1.5
million,
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
in
the
government
action
which
preceded
this,
the
action
was
brought
in
1946
and
tried
sometime
in
1956.
the
delay
was
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
it
was
alleged
that
national
security
was
somehow
involved
because
of
the
presence
of
uranium
in
the
vanadium-bearing
ore,
and
that
government
action
resulted
in
the
acquittal
of
these
defendants
but
the
government
action,
stayed
--
under
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
stayed
the
statute
of
limitations
for
enough
time
so
that
we
could
go
back
to
these
earlier
acts
and
the
jury
found
for
the
miners
in
salt
lake
city,
found
for
nisley
&
wilson
and
found
for
certain
of
a
--
certain
members
of
the
class.
it
was
all
those
who
mined
on
the
colorado
plateau.
and,
we
say
that
the
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
proves
--
on
suspectedly
the
same
record,
proves
that
there
is
a
factual
conflict
that
candid
--
that
ought
to
be
resolved
by
a
fact-finder,
a
trier
of
the
fact,
rather
than
by
the
court.
now,
in
addition
to
all
of
these
things,
the
court
of
appeals
admitted
some
concern
with
the
fact
that
where
you
prove
an
intent
to
eliminate
a
particular
competitor,
followed
by
the
elimination
of
that
competitor,
that
under
bigelow
and
story
parchment
and
eastman
kodak
that
that
would
have
to
be
determined
by
a
jury,
that
that
was
circumstantial
evidence
from
which
a
jury
could
make
the
finding
as
to
whether
or
not
legal
causation
existed.
it
admitted
some
misgivings
with
those
cases
and
simply
went
on
to
distinguish
the
bigelow
case
on
the
theory
that
bigelow
involved
the
defection
of
a
great
number
of
customers
and
this
involved
a
more
limited
number
of
suppliers,
a
more
limited
number
of
customers
with
whom
these
petitioners
were
working.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
no
distinction
at
all.
but
furthermore,
the
court
didn't
even
try
to
distinguish
the
story
parchment
case
and
the
kodak
case
when
it
recognized
that
this
principle
existed.
then
it
went
on,
as
i
say,
without
being
able
to
close
the
gap
entirely
to
hold
that
the
canadian
transaction,
the
elimination
of
these
petitioners
from
the
canadian
market
was
done
by
the
respondents.
it
admitted
it
was
done
for
the
purpose
--
it
assumed
it
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
entrenching
the
monopoly
which
existed
but
said,
because
of
the
noerr
case,
it
was
unable
to
find
or
to
predicate
any
antitrust
liability
upon
that
situation.
it's
a
little
different
than
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
had
granted
them
impunity
from
this
action,
this
total
elimination
from
the
canadian
market
on
the
basis
of
the
american
banana
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
placed
it
on
the
basis
of
the
noerr
decision.
now,
here's
a
factual
situation
so
far
as
that
canadian
market
is
concerned.
no
canadian
official
was
made
a
defendant
in
this
action.
no
canadian
official
was
being
proceeded
against.
the
defendants
did
have
a
canadian
subsidiary.
it
was
a
commercial
subsidiary.
during
the
war,
this
commercial
subsidiary
was
appointed
by
the
canadian
government
as
an
agent
to
purchase
vanadium.
we
alleged
and
we
offer
to
prove,
and
the
offer
of
proof
was
rejected,
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
would
--
and
retain
or
regard
or
consider
the
offer
of
proof
in
connection
with
this
decision.
we
alleged
that,
immediately
upon
being
appointed
the
agent
for
the
canadian
government,
that
the
canadian
subsidiary
or
the
respondent,
union
carbide,
joined
with
union
carbide
and
vca
and
they
agreed
they
will
cut
the
petitioner
off.
the
petitioner,
in
the
meantime,
had
developed
a
rather
substantial
business
on
shipments
from
long
island,
new
york
into
canada
with
the
atlas
steel
company
and
other
companies.
he
was
forbidden
under
this
arrangement,
except
for
a
few
shipments
after
he
had
established
the
business.
he
was
forbidden
to
sell
them
to
canada
at
all.
instead,
the
agent
for
the
canadian
government
which
was
a
subsidiary
of
these
respondents,
that
agent
purchased
the
vanadium
from
the
two
respondents.
in
other
words,
they
split
the
orders
that
he
had
in
canada,
the
business
he
had
in
canada
between
these
two
respondents.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
felt
that
the
noerr
case
somehow
compelled
this
result.
now,
that
same
question
came
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
and
it
went
just
the
other
way.
the
trial
court
in
the
tenth
circuit
case
--
cases
rather,
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
that
if
a
governmental
agency
were
used
in
a
commercial
transaction
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
or
furthering
the
objects
of
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize,
that
no
immunity
was
gained
by
the
governmental
agent
if
he
joined
that
conspiracy
in
effect
or
used
his
powers
to
further
that
conspiracy.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
considered
the
question
in
two
different
categories
and
in
two
different
factual
situations
and
it
analyzed
it
in
this
fashion.
it
said
that
if
the
government
agent
had
a
discretionary
power
to
buy
from
any
number
of
people
or
had
discretionary
power
to
engage
in
commercial
transactions
and
that
government
agent
exercised
his
discretion
so
as
to
assist
a
monopolization
or
a
restraint
of
trade,
then
the
government
agency
gained
no
immunity
or
the
government
agent
gained
no
immunity
by
reason
of
that
government
agency.
now,
here's
a
factual
situation
they
were
talking
about
in
that
situa
--
in
that
case.
union
carbide
was
appointed
as
a
procuring
agency
by
the
united
states
government
for
vanadium
and
uranium
at
a
certain
period
of
time.
union
carbide
was
authorized
--
the
respondent,
union
carbide,
was
authorized
to
pay
the
miners
anything
up
to
50
cents
a
pound.
union
carbide
and
vanadium
corporation
of
america
have
agreed
among
themselves
in
private
meetings,
as
so
far
as
their
own
purchases
were
concerned
for
their
own
account
that
they
would
pay
the
miners,
first,
21
cents
and
then
they
fixed
a
base
price
of
31
cents.
they
were
authorized
in
buying
for
the
government
in
the
war
program
to
pay
up
to
50
cents.
so,
the
evidence
proved
and
this
was
accepted
the
tenth
circuit
and
affirmed
by
the
tenth
circuit,
the
evidence
proved
that
they
took
their
governmental
power
and
fixed
the
price
in
accordance
with
their
private
agreement,
with
the
agreement
that
they
had
made
privately
among
themselves.
and
so,
the
court
of
appeals
says
that,
by
using
that
discretion
to
get
into
a
combination
to
restrain
trade
to
fix
prices
in
this
case,
that
the
governmental
agency
afforded
them
no
immunity
whatever,
and
this
is
the
analysis
which
the
court
has
made.
in
another
action
where
certain
claims
were
taken
away,
this
again
is
in
the
tenth
circuit,
certain
claims
were
taken
away
containing
valuable
uranium
lands,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“in
that
case,
the
government
directed
union
carbide
to
take
those
very
claims
and
therefore
the
governmental
agency
could
not
be
used
as
a
basis
for
predicating
antitrust
liability.”
now,
we
when
get
back
to
the
factual
situation
we
have
in
this
case,
this
is
what
developed.
the
petitioner
was
shipping
a
product
called
van-ex,
that's
a
vanadium
oxide
for
direct
introduction
into
the
steel
bath,
from
new
york
--
a
little
factory
it
had
in
new
york
to
canada
to
the
atlas
steel
company.
when
the
shipment
was
cut-off,
the
petitioner
protested
in
canada.
in
canada,
he
was
told
to
see
a
union
carbide
agent
in
new
york
city,
a
managing
agent
--
admittedly
a
managing
agent
of
new
--
of
union
carbide
in
new
york
city.
so,
he
went
to
see
this
managing
agent
in
new
york
or
rather
he
was
called
by
another
man
in
union
carbide
who
was
not
an
officer
and
told
to
appear
at
an
office
in
union
carbide
for
a
discussion
of
the
matter.
when
they
got
there,
this
agent
of
union
carbide
told
the
petitioner
that
they
had
no
right
in
the
vanadium
business
in
canada
or
the
united
states,
and
he
also
told
them
he
had
heard
they
were
making
certain
arrangements
with
the
climax
molybdenum
company
and
that
he
should
stay
away
from
climax
and,
if
he
didn't,
that
union
carbide
would
use
some
of
its
molybdenum
which
it
had
in
california
and
surplus
supply
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
reprisals
on
climax.
now,
all
of
this
was
excluded
by
the
trial
judge
on
the
theory
that,
somehow,
canadian
sovereignty
inter
--
intervened,
and
the
american
banana
decision
compelled
this
exclusion
of
evidence.
and
the
trial
judge
also
instructed
the
jury
that
the
--
that
no
act
done
on
behalf
of
the
government
of
canada
could
possibly
predict
--
could
possibly
be
the
basis
for
antitrust
liability.
let's
say
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
put
it
on
this
basis,
but
put
it
on
the
basis
of
the
noerr
case.
now,
another
factual
--
we
insist
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
actually
did
here
was
to
waive
facts
to
appraise
inferences
and
to
make
a
resolution
of
both
facts
and
inferences.
but
one
of
the
things
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
this,
"we
will
grant
that
90%
of
this
industry
may
have
been
monopolized
by
these
two
defendants
and
we
will
grant
that
these
two
defendants
by
agreement,
jointly
refused
to
supply
the
petitioners
for
vanadium
oxide
to
manufacture
ferrovanadium
or
to
export
as
vanadium
oxide
or
to
manufacture
their
van-ex,
which
was
a
vanadium
oxide
for
direct
introduction
into
the
steel
bath.
we
will
grant
that.
but
if
10%
was
on
the
outside
and
he
could
have
had
access
to
that
10%
and
didn't
take
the
10%
on
the
outside
then
there
can
be
no
question
of
causing
the
damage
to
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
caused
the
damage
to
himself
by
not
taking
that
10%.”
the
problem
about
that
is,
that
part
of
that
10%
was
being
supplied
by
nisley
&
wilson
who
at
the
very
time
were
being
proceeded
against
were
the
victims
of
a
campaign
to
eliminate
them
and
they
were
eliminated.
and
the
evidence
is
in
the
record
that
they
were
eliminated
as
a
result
of
this
campaign.
as
i
say
in
nisley
&
wilson's
private
suit,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
said
there
was
a
factual
foundation
for
this
elimination.
i
think
that
that
proves
on
its
face
that
there
was
a
factual
conflict
which
a
trier
of
the
fact
should
have
resolved
instead
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
addition
to
that,
this
other
portion,
this
other
10%
was
in
--
was
an
undependable
supply.
it
was
a
supply
that
was
supposed
to
come
from
africa
instead
of
the
united
states
or
a
supply
that
was
supposed
to
come
from
flue
dust
on
ships
when
and
if
they
ever
arrived
in
port,
and
this
was
1944
that
this
activity
was
going
on.
so,
i
submit
to
the
trier
or
the
fact
has
a
perfect
right
to
find
from
all
the
evidence
in
the
case,
and
there
was
direct
evidence
as
well
as
export
evidence
upon
this
matter
that
this
10%
was
not
only
an
undependable
supply.
but
in
addition
to
that,
it
was
being
attacked
by
the
monopolist
who
eliminated
--
who
eliminated
the
millers
of
oxide
about
three
months
after
the
court
said
it
should
have
taken
it
from
them.
and
that,
under
these
circumstances,
a
jury
could
have
found
that
the
failure
of
petitioners
was
directly
caused
by
the
violations
which
were
alleged.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
under
erroneous
instructions.
one
of
the
instructions
being
that
they
have
the
absolute
right
to
eliminate
this
petitioner
if
there
was
still
enough
vanadium
left
in
their
hands
to
supply
the
general
public.
this
was
the
klor
instruction
which
was
reversed.
in
addition
to
that,
the
court
refused
to
give
the
bigelow
instructions.
it
said
it
didn't
believe
in
it
and
said
that
somebody
has
to
reverse
the
supreme
court.
it
went
on
to
state
exactly
why
it
didn't
believe
in
it.
so,
it
was
submitted,
mr.
justice
harlan,
but,
as
i
say,
under
patently
erroneous
instructions.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
there
is
another
matter,
if
your
honor
please.
the
court
of
appeals
conceded
that
there
was
one
element,
the
elimination
of
petitioners
from
the
canadian
market
which
could
not
be
covered
by
his
analysis
of
causation
--
of
legal
causation
but
was
covered
by
this
court's
decision
in
noerr.
now,
if
this
court
holds
that
the
noerr
case,
as
you
know
is
a
combination
to
lobby
legislation,
doesn't
cover
a
commercial
situation
such
as
we
have
here,
then
even
under
the
court
of
appeals'
notion,
there
was
something
that
might
have
gone
to
a
jury
and
i
just
wonder
why
it's
necessary
to
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
act
on
these
other
things
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
had
that
element
that
must
go
to
a
jury.
so,
it's
something
more
than
that.
but
those
are
the
two
issues
we're
asking.
first
of
all,
that
there
were
the
facts
to
justify
cause
and
secondly,
that
the
noerr
case
can't
possibly
cover
a
commercial
arrangement
such
as
the
one
that
we
spoken
of
here.
now,
when
we
get
down
to
analysis
of
these
cases,
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
made
it
very
clear
in
noerr
that
it
was
talking
only
about
a
combination
to
lobby
legislation
and
that
manifestly,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
situation
where
a
petitioner
or
where
a
defendant
is
able
to
get
itself
appointed
as
a
procuring
officer
for
a
government
and,
in
connection
with
that
procurement,
instead
of
exercising
its
discretion
to
buy-in
the
open
market
or
to
buy
competitively.
it
instead
joins
that
power
to
purchase
with
a
preexisting
conspiracy
to
monopolize
and
to
restraint
the
trade
of
a
--
of
another
competitor.
all
of
which
has
the
effect
and
the
purpose
of
eliminating
that
competitor
from
the
canadian
market.
i
submit
that
that
has
no
reasonable
relationship
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
people
may
combine
for
the
purpose
of
lobbying
through
legislation
or
having
legislation
pass
even
though
that
legislation
does
have
an
anticompetitive
effect.
and
i
would
like
to
point
on
this
connection
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
refused
to
follow
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
on
this
matter.
it
held
that
the
noerr
case
didn't
--
didn't
authorize
a
government
agent
to
join
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
or
conspiracy
to
monopolize
trade.
it
further
held
that
the
--
that
the
noerr
case
was
simply
--
simply
held
that
a
combination
to
instigate
legislation,
even
though
it
might
have
anticompetitive
effects.
it's
certainly
not
a
combination
to
persuade
a
government
agent
that
he
should
use
his
agency
powers
for
the
purpose
of
furthering
the
interest
of
a
preexisting
conspiracy
to
monopolize.
i
submit,
if
your
honor
please,
that
those
are
the
issues
in
the
case
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
simply
overlooks,
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
story
parchment,
eastman
kodak,
and
bigelow.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
evidence
--
the
actual
evidence
that
was
adduced
in
the
story
parchment
case
by
comparison
to
the
evidence
that
was
produced
in
this
case
and
in
this
court,
pales
almost
into
insignificance.
all
you
have
in
story
parchment,
if
you
recall,
was
the
fact
that
after
the
low
prices
by
the
defendants
in
that
action,
the
worth
of
the
plant
which
petitioner
had
in
that
case
decreased
in
value.
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
that
petitioner
would
have
failed
anyway
because
he
didn't
have
any
business
knowhow
and
he
was
undercapitalized.
the
supreme
court
said
that
that
wasn't
the
question
for
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
a
question
for
the
jury.
as
i
say,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
the
story
parchment
case
presented
some
difficulties
as
in
bigelow
and
eastman
kodak,
but
didn't
go
on
to
distinguish
those
two
cases.
i
submit
they
can't
be
distinguished.
in
addition
to
that,
we
submit
that
the
noerr
case
can't
possibly
cover
a
commercial
arrangement
such
as
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
do
want
me
to
report
on
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i'll
look
for
more
tonight.
it's
--
you
asked
for
admissions
by
the
plaintiffs
here
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
record
on
page
1237
shows
an
admission
regarding
the
1939
to
1940
period.
record
page
1177
shows
an
admission
early
in
1942.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
1177
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
mr.
justice
black,
and
1196
shows
the
statement
in
--
regarding
1943.
and,
in
the
brief
of
petitioner,
page
56,
the
statement
is
made
in
november
1943,
the
emergency
shortage
of
vanadium
oxide
was
over
--
vanadium
oxide
was
in
oversupply.
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
pardon
me?
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
56.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
they
don't,
your
honor,
because
of
the
entire
period.
however,
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
they
do
make
a
state.
they
don't
use
the
word
“reliable.”
they
say
“regular
and
adequate.”
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no.
they
--
these
three
cover
the
--
the
first
one
i
gave
you
covers
39
to
40.
the
second
one
is
in
february
of
1942.
the
third
one
is
in
1943
and
the
fourth
one
in
the
brief
is
in
november
of
1943.
now,
the
record
shows
that
there
were
no
requests
made
of
either
defendant
for
1942
and
for
about
half
of
1941.
for
a
period
of
almost
two
years,
they
requested
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
if
your
honor
please,
requests
were
made
beginning
in
1939
right
down
to
1943,
and
requests
were
uniformly
denied.
the
one
or
two
and
jointly,
and
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
they
were
denied
jointly
as
a
result
of
the
conspiracy
in
connection
with
its
--
its
decision.
they
were
denied
with
the
statement
direct
evidence
on
the
stand
if
they
were
denied
because
they
wanted
to
keep
mr.
leir
out
of
the
business.
that's
the
basis
for
the
denial.
in
november
of
1943,
the
last
request
was
made
to
both
defendants
for
10,000
or
15,000
pounds
a
month
for
any
term
of
years
they
would
give
them.
they
uniformly
turn
them
down
at
the
time
when
there
was
a
burdensome
surplus
of
vanadium
oxide
and
the
reasons
assigned
for
turning
them
down
was
they
wanted
to
keep
him
out
of
the
business.
now,
in
the
light
of
that
kind
of
record,
it's
just
of
course
--
it
just
isn't
so
to
say
that
there
was
ever
any
admission
that
we
had
a
steady
dependable
supply.
our
contention,
uniformly
made
in
all
court
below
has
been
that
we
didn't
have
that
kind
of
a
supply
and
that's
what
we
were
complaining
of.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
if
your
honor
please,
not
at
all.
when
we
asked
them
in
1939
for
a
supply,
they
both
uniformly
denied
it
to
us
and
then
sold
a
million
pounds
to
the
germans.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
want
very
briefly
announce
to
refer
to
three
of
the
points
made
yesterday
by
counsel.
first,
with
respect
to
the
offer
of
proof,
that
offer
of
proof
related
as
you
recall
to
the
canadian
elimination
and
this
to
the
elimination
of
the
petitioner
from
the
canadian
market.
the
shipments
we
were
talking
about
in
connection
with
that
elimination
were
shipments
which
originated
in
new
york
city
or
in
long
island
rather
and
were
shipped
from
there
to
the
canadian
border.
we're
talking
about
the
american
commerce
and
we're
talking
about
a
conspiracy
which
had
the
situs
in
america,
formed
in
america
and
executed
in
america.
now,
in
connection
with
the
offer
of
proof,
we
submitted
and
that's
being
tag
here,
we
submitted
some
29
letters
and
these
letters
were
exchanged
of
correspondence
between
the
petitioners
in
this
case
and
the
union
carbide
company
and
its
wholly
owned
affiliate
electro
met
at
canada.
with
electro
met
at
canada,
its
wholly
owned
affiliate,
its
wholly
owned
subsidiaries
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
the
agent
for
the
metals
controller
of
canada.
now,
there
isn't
any
question
about
the
fact
of
the
actual
eliminations.
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
they
were
eliminated
from
that
market
and
the
only
thing
we're
talking
about
is
why
they
were
eliminated
from
that
market.
when
they
were
eliminated
from
the
market
and
they
have
very
substantial
costumers
in
canada,
when
they
were
eliminated
from
that
market,
their
business
was
split
between
the
two
respondents,
so
it
literally
taken
away
from
them
and
given
to
the
respondents.
their
business
was
taken
from
them
by
electro
met
of
canada
which
was
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
union
carbide.
when
they
complained
about
it
under
the
offer
of
proof
and
then
documents
that
we
submitted
in
connection
with
that
offer
of
proof
which
were
marked
for
identification
and
which
were
excluded
by
the
lower
court,
when
they
complained
about
it,
they
didn't
go
to
canada
to
complain
about
it.
they
went
to
new
york
city
at
the
office
of
union
carbide
and
they
saw
a
man
named
mr.
walker
who
was
--
wrote
to
a
man
named
mr.
walker
who
was
admittedly
an
authorized
agent
of
union
carbide.
and
they
complained
about
the
fact
that
they
were
excluded
and
that
their
business
was
divided
between
the
two
american
companies
who
under
the
assumptions
of
the
court
were
engaged
in
this
conspiracy
to
monopolize
the
business.
then
the
authorized
agent
under
the
offer
of
proof
had
another
man
named
arroway
called
the
petitioners
to
talk
about
this
thing.
now,
as
this
man
named
arroway
that
mr.
archer
yesterday
called
the
court
who
made
certain
admissions,
they
were
in
jury
as
to
the
interest
of
the
corporation.
but
under
our
offer
of
proof,
we
offer
to
prove
and
it's
explicit
that
mr.
arroway
far
from
being
a
clerk
was
the
confidential
agent
of
union
carbide
in
connection
with
this
international
business
that
he
was
a
liaison
man
of
union
carbide
in
connection
with
relations
with
the
european
cartels
that
he
was
an
important
man,
a
high-salaried
man
in
the
union
carbide
office,
and
specifically
that
mr.
arroway
was
directed
to
contact
petitioners
by
those
who
were
admittedly
authorized
agents.
now,
we
submitted
to
your
honor
please
of
that
offer
of
proof.
the
court
please
that
offer
of
proof
is
sufficient,
it
clearly
set
out
the
issue
and
the
trial
court
rejected
it
on
the
theory
of
the
american
banana
case
and
he
wasn't
going
to
get
into
the
acts
of
canada
at
all.
when
it
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
admitted
was
willing
to
assume
that
what
was
done
in
connection
with
eliminating
these
petitioners
from
the
canadian
market
was
done
for
the
very
purpose
of
entrenching
the
monopoly
which
he
was
also
assuming.
but
he
said
that
the
noerr
case
prevented
him
from
giving
any
antitrust
implications
to
this
obvious
elimination
in
the
canadian
market.
we
submit
that
the
offer
which
is
set
out
in
pages
438
to
468
of
the
record
so
far
as
the
actual
correspondence
is
concerned
and
the
full
oral
offer
made
before
the
court
at
some
length
set
out
in
pages
817
to
839
of
the
record
that
the
offer
is
sufficient
and
its
rejection
and
that
alone
justifies
sending
this
case
back
for
a
retrial.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
438
to
468
mr.
justice
harlan
of
the
actual
correspondence,
29
pages
of
correspondence
that
we
have
marked
for
identification
offered
in
the
evidence
in
connection
with
this
offer
of
proof
was
rejected.
then
pages
817
to
839
of
the
oral
offer
made
to
judge
--
the
late
judge
vaught
in
the
trial
court
in
which
he
rejected
on
the
american
banana
decision
that
this
was
a
canadian
situation
of
the
final
act
was
performed
by
canada
even
though
we
pointed
out
to
him
that
we
were
talking
about
american
shipments,
the
american
conspiracies
and
then
the
action
which
obviously
affect
the
united
states
exports.
so,
we
think
it
obviously
sufficient.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
reason
i
think
not,
justice
stewart,
is
because
in
the
court
of
appeals
admitted
that
this
was
one
gap,
it
couldn't
reach
by
its
notion
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
legal
causation.
other
words,
if
they
could
--
if
they
could
handle,
if
they
could
take
cognizance
of
this
under
the
sherman
act,
then
admittedly
there
was
direct
causation,
they
stopped
the
shipment
of
these
petitioners
and
took
them
out
of
the
canadian
market
because
since
that's
the
gap,
he
couldn't
reach
on
the
matter
of
legal
causation.
and
if
the
court
is
satisfied
that
the
lower
court's
theory
of
the
--
based
on
the
american
banana
opinion
was
wrong,
i
see
no
reason
why
we
can't
go
back
for
a
trial
and
--
and
i
don't
have
to
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
court
of
appeals
by
implication
rejected
the
american
banana
contention
because
it
said
i
am
willing
to
assume
that
what
was
done
in
connection
with
the
canadian
shipments
was
done
to
entrench
the
american
monopoly.
so,
while
it
didn't
mention
the
american
banana
opinion,
it
implicitly
rejected
it
in
that
statement.
but
then
went
on
to
say
that
this
court's
opinion
in
noerr
prevented
it
from
doing
anything
about
it.
the
court
of
appeals
endeavor
on
the
contrary
said
that
there
was
a
manifest
difference
between
instigating
a
government
agent
to
inhibit
commercial
activities
as
against
instigating
a
legislature
to
pass
a
law
which
has
any
competitive
effects.
we
submit
that
that
distinction
is
valid.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
if
your
honor
--
if
we
lose
on
the
matter
causation,
no
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
much
of
it,
if
that
much
of
it
was
caused
by
this
monopolization
that
that
would
somehow
affect
the
other
operations
of
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
is
the
worldwide
trading
organization
of
considerable
substance.
it
was
the
time
of
trial.
and
they
if
it's
found
that
the
monopoly
affected
the
petitioner's
business
at
that
extent,
and
then
it
seems
to
me
that
that
inspects
the
entire
record
and
all
of
the
other
activities.
the
petitioner
was
basically
engaged
in
exporting
ferrovanadium
and
vanadium
oxide
in
manufacturing
under
association's
ferrovanadium
in
procuring
a
vanadium
oxide
source
and
so
i
don't
think
that
we
would
be
limited
on
retrial
to
just
that
issues.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
if
--
if
our
position
on
causation
is
--
if
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
on
causation
is
accepted
totally
for
the
five
episodes
or
the
five
transactions
which
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned.
i
assume
that
we
would
be
out
on
that
matter.
but
there
is
a
great
deal
more
on
that
record
besides
those
five
transactions.
this
was
a
general
business
which
these
petitioners
have
in
vanadium
oxide,
vanadium
ore
and
ferrovanadium,
and
there
was
a
good
deal
more
on
that
record
than
just
those
five
transactions
that
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at.
so,
i
don't
think
in
the
light
of
that
that
the
retrial
i
think
it
would
be
limited
necessarily
to
just
that
one
transaction.
for
example,
these
petitioners
bought,
when
they
were
able
to
get
the
government
to
foresee
spokes
to
sell
to
them,
these
petitioners
bought
vanadium
oxide
at
the
fixed
prices.
now,
the
fixed
prices
were
approximately
30
cents
a
pound
above
what
they
dealt
with
as
between
themselves.
when
they
were
dealing
between
themselves,
they
dealt
at
30
cents
below
the
price
that
they
sold
to
these
petitioners
and
submitted
the
evidence
if
that
price
was
fixed.
now,
that
transaction
for
example
would
obviously
be
in
a
lawsuit.
but
if
your
honor
means
where
there's
specific
transactions
found
not
to
have
been
caused
by
the
conspiracy,
should
the
court
hold
that
there
isn't
any
countervailing
evidence
in
connection
with
the
question
of
legal
causation.
i
assume
that
the
court
approves
that
that
we
be
barred
from
going
into
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
that's
--
that's
correct
mr.
justice
clark.
however,
if
this
court
approves
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
to
the
effect
that
we
should
never
have
gotten
to
a
jury
on
these
things
and
that's
how
the
court
of
appeals
avoided
meeting
the
issue
of
the
obviously
erroneous
instructions.
so
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
we
objected
to
the
klor
instructions
for
example.
at
the
time
we
were
arguing
the
instructions,
the
klor
case
was
midway
between
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
supreme
court.
they
gambled
that
this
court
was
going
to
affirm
the
ninth
circuit,
so
they
lost
their
gamble
when
this
court
unanimously
reversed
on
the
klor
case.
so
that's
an
obvious
one.
and
then
the
context
of
this
case,
there
has
some
significance
mr.
justice
clark
because
the
effect
of
the
klor
decision
giving
the
klor
instruction
to
this
jury
was
to
say
to
the
jury
that
union
carbide
and
vca
may
with
impunity
directly
intend
to
eliminate
this
petitioner
and
actually
eliminate
this
petitioner
so
long
as
they
themselves
have
enough
left
to
serve
the
public
generally.
that
was
the
effect
of
the
klor's
instruction.
it
went
that
far
in
the
context
of
this
case,
so
it's
obviously
erroneous.
when
we
ask
the
court
to
give
the
bigelow
instruction,
that's
when
the
court
openly
said
that
they
proposed
to
stop
reversing
the
supreme
court.
it
didn't
believe
in
the
bigelow
instruction.
it
wouldn't
give
it
and
didn't
give
it.
then
the
court
directly
instructed
that
any
acts
that
were
done
while
union
carbide
or
any
of
its
agents
were
acting
as
government
agents
to
purchase
vanadium
oxide
were
totally
immunized
by
the
antitrust
laws,
which
we
believed
is
also
a
mistaken.
those
three
standout
particularly,
those
three
i
think
are
rather
obvious,
but
under
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
that
was
never
reached
because
it
held
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
should
have
been
granted
on
the
ground
that
weren't
--
didn't
have
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
causation.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
there's
no
question
about
it.
they
bought
it
at
80
cents,
your
honor
please,
we
bought
it
a
dollar
10
cents
a
pounds
and
they
try
to
charge
it
at
a
dollar
15
cents
a
pound.
after
a
squabble,
we're
able
to
get
down
to
a
dollar
and
10
cents
a
pound.
now
on
that,
we
asked
the
lower
court
to
instruct
that
we
were
entitled
to
recover
under
any
circumstances
the
difference
between
those
two
prices
or
the
difference
between
what
we
paid
and
what
the
market
would
have
been
in
the
essence
of
conspiracy.
the
court
wouldn't
even
submit
that
issues
to
the
jury
even
though
it
was
in
the
record
and
clearly
in
the
record,
we
made
a
serious
point
of
it
and
that
wasn't
even
taking
cognizance
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
it's
obviously
no
question
about
causation
there.
i
mean,
we
paid
a
30
cent
higher
price.
obviously,
we
were
injured
and
that
injury
was
caused
by
the
price
fixing
conspiracy.
the
lower
court
simply
wouldn't
instruct
the
jury
on
it,
wouldn't
even
let
the
jury
decide
the
issue
and
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
it
entirely.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
you
think
it
will
be
clearly
reversible
to
give
the
klor's
instructions
because
the
jury
couldn't
found
just
that
that
they
did
throw
them
out,
they
intended
to
throw
them
out
and
they
did
do
it
as
the
result
of
this
conspiracy
to
monopolize
but
since
they
themselves
may
have
had
enough
material
to
otherwise
service
the
public,
there
was
no
injury
in
the
course
that
was
rejected.
and
this
folks
directly
gambled
on
it
and
lost.
as
i
say
they're
gambled.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
specific
instruction
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i'll
get
those
pages.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
i'll
continue
and
meanwhile
mr.
saveri
will
get
those
pages
for
us.
now
yesterday,
some
statement
was
made
that
if
it
wasn't
true
that
prices
were
actually
fixed
by
agreement.
the
statement
was
made
at
the
opa
fixed
prices.
now
obviously,
the
opa
didn't
fixed
prices
for
--
for
competitors.
what
happened
was
that
the
price
fixing
conspiracy
under
the
evidence
and
under
the
acknowledgement
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
place
before
the
opa
was
even
passed.
and
all
the
opa
did
was
to
free
that
sealing,
those
conspiratorial
prices
which
had
been
fixed
by
agreement,
and
they
would
fixed
as
simply
--
as
simply
meeting
in
hotel
rooms
in
fixing
those
prices,
meeting
in
lunch
rooms
in
fixing
those
prices.
now
yesterday,
mr.
justice
black
asked
one
--
one
of
the
counsels
for
respondents
whether
there
was
any
claim
by
the
petitioners
that
there
was
some
evidence
in
the
case
other
than
the
intention
to
eliminate
these
petitioners
followed
by
the
elimination
of
the
petitioners.
and
counsel
answered
that
that's
pretty
much
the
contention
being
made
there.
well
now
of
course,
it's
not
the
contention
being
made
here.
what
we
are
contending
is
that
on
the
story
parchment,
under
eastman
and
under
bigelow,
if
there
is
the
type
of
violation
which
has
a
tendency
to
inflict
the
harm
which
actually
follows
that
then
the
jury
determines,
the
jury
determine
--
can
determine
from
those
circumstances
that
there
was
legal
causation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
took
cognizance
of
the
ruling
in
those
three
cases
to
stop.
the
bigelow
case
was
distinguishable
and
didn't
even
attempt
to
distinguish
the
other
two.
now,
we
make
that
argument,
however,
we
have
a
good
deal
more
than
that
in
this
record.
we
start
out
with
a
general
conspiracy
to
monopolize
which
was
assumed
by
the
court.
and
then
there
is
a
specific
term
of
that
conspiracy
that
all
competition
whenever
it
rates
it
had
would
be
eliminated
and
there
were
series
of
events
which
took
place
in
the
elimination
of
some
eight
oxide
mills
and
the
agents
for
the
--
and
these
mills
were
sources
or
supplied
for
these
petitioners.
and
the
chief
managing
agent
in
this
connection
for
union
carbide,
the
man
named
burwell
testified
at
the
trial
that
they
eliminated
these
mills
or
they
took
over
certain
production
for
the
specific
reason
of
keeping
them
off
the
american
market
and
for
the
specific
reason
of
preventing
them
to
be
used
as
a
nucleus
for
a
competitive
operation.
we
have
that
kind
of
evidence
in
this
case.
now,
in
addition
to
that
and
in
addition
to
the
intent,
the
general
intent
to
eliminate
competition,
we
have
statements
that
both
of
these
respondents
stated
that
they
directly
intended
to
eliminate
these
petitioners.
it's
a
specific
intent
to
eliminate
directed
against
these
petitioners,
and
there
was
a
joint
refusal
to
sell
by
these
respondents
at
the
time
when
they
were
burdening
surpluses.
and
in
the
connection
with
the
joint
refusal
to
sell
and
these
sales
were
on
the
basis
of
a
steady,
dependable
supply
over
series
of
years
so
that
they
could
predicate
a
manufacturing
operation
on
--
on
that
supply,
the
specific
evidence
was
that
the
refusal
to
sell
was
because
they
wanted
to
keep
the
petitioners
out
of
the
vanadium
business
and
these
came
from
both
sides,
both
from
union
carbide
and
from
the
vanadium
corporation
of
america.
in
addition
to
that,
they
interfered
with
their
sources
of
supply.
they
eliminated
nisley
&
wilson
which
was
their
chief
vanadium
oxide
supplier.
nisley
&
wilson
as
i
say
filed
his
suit
in
salt
lake
city,
he
won.
and
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
said
that
he
was
eliminated
pursuant
to
the
conspiracy
and
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient.
now,
it's
the
identical
record
in
san
francisco
and
in
salt
lake
on
the
issue
of
nisley
&
wilson.
therefore,
it
seems
that
apparent
that
reasonable
men,
it
seems
obvious
that
reasonable
men
can't
disagree
about
an
interpretation
of
this
evidence
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
said
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
sustain
the
verdict
and
the
judgment
that
nisley
&wilson
who
were
the
petitioner's
principal
supplier
was
eliminated
pursuant
to
that
conspiracy.
so,
there
was
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
we
don't
have
to
go
to
that
extreme
of
proposition.
for
example,
if
they
induce
the
government
of
canada
as
a
legislative
matter
to
adopt
the
--
by
english
policy
or
by
commonwealth
policy
and
that
legislation
was
validly
packed,
and
as
a
result
of
that
valid
--
that
legislation,
they
weren't
able
to
ship
as
they
had
been
in
the
past
from
america
to
canada.
i
think
that
that's
situation
would
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws
but
we
aren't
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
we
accept
that
but
we
say
we
have
a
lot
--
we
have
--
we
have
something
here,
the
justices
of
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
evidence
is
much
broader
and
we
see
the
noerr
case,
it
simply
permitted
a
combination
--
a
combination
to
lobby
or
combination
to
induce
the
passage
of
legislation.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
man
who
is
the
--
who
was
a
company
which
is
the
wholly
own
subsidiary
of
one
of
the
respondents,
union
carbide.
the
union
carbide
at
this
time
had
standing
alone,
75%
of
all
the
outside
produced
in
america
standing
alone
together,
they
had
90%.
union
carbide
alone
had
75%
of
this.
the
canadian
government
appoints
this
subsidiary
to
act
as
a
purchasing
agent
and
it
doesn't
say,
“you
mustn't
buy
from
this
person
to
that
person
or
the
other
person.”
and
simply
says,
“you
buy
vanadium
oxide
for
us,
so
you
buy
ferrovanadium
for
us.”
then
the
new
york
officials
under
our
offer
of
proof
direct
the
subsidiary,
the
canadian
subsidiary
to
refuse
to
deal
with
the
petitioners
at
all
and
to
divide
the
petitioners
pre-existing
business
between
the
two
conspirators
which
it
does.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
mr.
justice
black.
in
connection
with
our
offer
of
proof,
we've
been
offer
to
prove
that
the
canadian
government
and
the
canadian
metals
controller
was
oblivious
to
what
was
going
on
in
connection
with
eliminating
petitioner
and
the
court
accepted
that
as
far
as
the
offer
and
went
on
to
say
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
because
of
the
american
banana
case.
this
is
the
manner
in
which
was
handled
by
the
lower
court.
what
you
have
here
was
a
discretionary
power
to
purchase
which
these
folks
wedded
to
a
pre-existing
conspiracy
to
monopolize
or
which
they
use
for
the
purpose
of
furthering
the
objectives
of
that
monopolization,
and
we
think
that
noerr
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
and
the
tenth
circuit
made
this
type
of
a
distinction
in
connection
with
these
other
cases.
now,
in
addition
to
the
actual
intent
to
eliminate
the
joint
refusal
to
supply,
the
interference,
the
sources
supply,
they
also
interfered
with
petitioner's
manufacturing
contract
with
the
apex
smelting
company.
this
is
the
contract
to
manufacture
ferrovanadium
which
was
the
only
competitive
ferrovanadium
to
that
manufactured
by
respondents,
the
only
competitive
ferrovanadium
in
the
entire
period
of
time.
vca
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
apex
manufacturing
company
that
have
a
14-year
contract
with
petitioners,
beginning
in
1938.
the
vca
entered
into
negotiations.
and
as
a
result
of
negotiations,
they
bought
the
equipment
and
the
plant
was
dismantled.
now,
vca
said
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
but
on
the
identical
evidence,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
and
its
opinion
on
the
identical
evidence
on
this
point
said,
“this
is
undisputed
that
apex
approached
vca
to
sell
its
equipment
and
stock
pile
but
this
is
also
inferable
that
vca's
interest
in
the
apex
equipment
and
stock
pile
was
generated
by
the
plan
to
discourage
independent
milling.
i
say
again,
while
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
says
that
reasonable
men
couldn't
possibly
disagree
with
respect
to
what
these
facts
shows.
here,
we
have
tenth
circuit
finding
that
the
elimination
of
apex
to
purchase
of
its
equipment
of
dismantling
of
that
plant
which
petitioners
used
to
produce
ferrovanadium
was
done
pursuant
to
this
scheme
to
monopolize
the
industry
and
to
eliminate
competition.
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
a
possibility
the
petitioners
were
going
to
set
up
a
mill
in
the
area.
the
durango
mill
which
had
been
built
by
the
government
and
which
was
taken
over
by
the
petitioners
at
the
time
when
they
admitted,
they
didn't
need
another
mill
because
they
closed
down
some
of
their
own
mills.
and
then
in
their
office,
the
memorandum
of
the
petitioners
states,
“that
we
must
get
our
hands
on
this
mill
--”
of
the
respondents
rather
states,
“that
we
must
get
our
hands
on
this
mill
to
prevent
competition
in
the
post-war
era."
and
the
evidence
shows
that
these
petitioners
and
other
various
substantial
mining
companies
at
that
time
were
negotiating
to
acquire
this
mill.
in
addition
to
that,
they
fixed
prices
on
the
vanadium
oxides
sole
and
these
petitioners
bought
that
vanadium
oxide.
so
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
yesterday
should
have
been
that
in
addition
to
the
intent
to
eliminate
--
in
addition
to
this
specific
intent
to
eliminate
these
petitioners,
there
was
all
of
these
evidence
that
interference
with
the
sources
supply,
joint
refusal
to
supply
the
acquisition
of
the
apex
manufacturing
facilities
and
the
acquisition
of
the
mill,
they
get
the
need.
i
don't
know
actually
how
much
more
evidence
you
can
produce
in
the
case
of
this
type
so
i
think
the
evidence
was
manifestly
sufficient
to
permit
a
jury.
now,
a
jury
might
have
found
against
us.
the
jury
was
never
permitted
to
find
against
this
based
on
adequate
instructions.
for
this
reason,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
for
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed
and
this
case,
we
send
back
in
trial
court.
