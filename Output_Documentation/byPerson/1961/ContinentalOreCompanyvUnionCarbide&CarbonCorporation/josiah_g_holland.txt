mr.
josiah
g.
holland
mr.
chief
justice
and
this
honorable
court.
i
represent
the
respondent,
vanadium
corporation
of
america.
mr.
archer
who
represents
the
union
carbide,
respondents,
will
cover
the
question
of
the
canadian
situation
and
i
will
cover
the
other
questions
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
i
think
i
should
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
just
what
kind
of
a
case
this
is
and
just
why
it's
here
because
so
much
of
the
brief
of
petitioner
and
so
much
of
his
questions
has
taken
up
with
trying
to
show
what
a
terrible
conspiracy
this
was
when
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
rendering
its
decision
and
for
the
purposes
of
its
decision
assumed
that
a
conspiracy
had
been
proved.
and
it's
under
that
assumption
that
we
come
--
that
the
case
comes
here
on
the
one
question.
assuming
a
conspiracy
and
assuming
that
there
was
evidence
or
really
not
discussing
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
of
the
amount
of
damage,
nevertheless
must
a
plaintiff
in
an
antitrust
case
prove
causation?
must
he
prove
that
the
acts
of
the
defendants
which
are
assumed
to
have
been
done
pursuant
to
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
and
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
must
those
acts
have
caused
his
injury
and
must
the
plaintiff
prove
that
either
by
direct
evirence
--
or
evidence
from
which
a
reasonable
inference
can
be
drawn
as
in
the
bigelow
case.
now,
mr.
alioto
has
spent
considerable
time
arguing
the
cases
which
were
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
would
assume
because
there,
the
judgment
and
the
verdict
were
for
the
plaintiffs
rather
than
from
the
defendants.
but,
on
this
question
of
causation,
those
cases
are
not
in
point
at
all.
we
have
an
industry
here,
the
vanadium
industry,
which
starts
with
raw
ore.
that
ore
is
converted
into
oxide
by
mills.
the
oxide
is
in
turn
converted
into
ferrovanadium
for
introduction
into
the
steel
bath,
and
practically
all
or
mostly
all
of
it
is
sold
to
the
steel
industry.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
cases
in
the
--
in
the
tenth
circuit,
we
were
involved
with
the
ore
miners
and
we
were
involved
with
a
mill,
the
nisley
&
wilson
mill,
which
made
the
oxide.
we
were
involved
with
two
other
steps
in
this
process
of
making
vanadium,
and
proof
of
causation
in
those
cases
furnishes
no
analogy
whatever
to
proof
of
causation
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
mr.
leir,
whose
name
can
be
used
interchangeably
with
the
continental
ore
corporation
because
he
and
his
immediate
family
owned
it,
came
to
this
country
in
1938.
he
had
had
experience
in
the
ferroalloy
business
in
europe
and
he
determined
to
go
into
the
ferroalloy
business
here,
not
as
a
fully
integrated
company
and
not
with
the
expenditure
of
a
large
sum
of
money
to
set
up
the
business,
but
he
wanted
to
come
in
at
the
last
step
in
the
business.
he
wanted
to
buy
the
oxide
from
--
mostly
produced
by
these
respondents,
although
varying
amounts
of
it
at
least
10%
and
during
the
certain
periods
more
than
that
were
produced
by
independent
producers
--
other
producers.
he
wanted
to
get
in
at
that
stage,
buy
oxide,
take
it
to
someone
such
as
the
apex
smelting
company,
whom
he
did,
have
that
company
convert
it
into
ferrovanadium
and
then
in
turn,
sell
the
ferrovanadium.
now,
the
--
judge
magruder,
sitting
in
the
tenth
circuit,
after
stating
the
proposition,
simply
said,
“you
still
have
to
prove
causation,”
this
is
not
the
bigelow
case,
and
i
shall
discuss
that
later.
“here,
i'm
going
to
assume
that
this
conspiracy
existed
and
that
the
acts
complained
of
were
done
but
did
those
acts
in
anyway
damage
or
injure
this
plaintiff?”
and,
the
judge
in
that
case
made
a
very
careful
factual
analysis.
he
took
a
long
time
to
write
his
opinion.
and
after
examining
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
record,
both
the
evidence
that
was
admitted
by
the
lower
court
and
the
evidence
which
was
excluded
by
the
lower
court
and
assuming
it
to
be
admissible.
after
all
that
he
said,
“well,
now,
here's
the
complaint.
this
man
comes
into
this
business
at
the
level
of
buying
oxide
and
he
says
that
the
plaintiff's
had
a
conspiracy
and
they
damaged
him
because
they
shut
off
his
sources
of
supply.
they
wouldn't
sell
to
him
and
they
shut
off
his
sources
of
supply.
he
couldn't
get
oxide.
and
therefore,
he
had
to
go
out
of
the
business.”
but,
the
circuit
court
found
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
record,
that
admitting
all
--
everything,
a
careful
--
examination
of
the
record
clearly
disclosed
that
at
all
times,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
had
plenty
of
oxide
and
could
have
had
plenty
of
oxide
and
that
at
the
time
he
went
out
of
business
in
1944
or
at
least
he
says
he
did
although
there's
no
real
proof
that
he
went
out
of
business
then.
at
that
time,
there
was
a
lot
of
oxide
and
he
was
offered
large
quantities
of
it
but
he
wouldn't
take
it.
so,
it's
--
it
boils
down
to
a
simple
proposition
as
that.
now,
the
first
venture
that
continental
ore
went
in
was
with
the
apex
smelting
company,
and
that
was
its
more
serious
venture.
apex
was
a
melter
of
secondary
aluminum
in
chicago
and
continental
ore
made
a
contract
with
apex
under
which
continental
ore
was
to
procure
oxide
for
apex
and
apex
was
to
procure
it
too.
they
were
to
make
ferrovanadium
from
it,
according
to
mr.
leir's
process
which
was
owned
by
a
french
company
named
fred
a.
coleman,
and
they
were
to
deliver
the
ferrovanadium,
the
finished
product
to
customers
that
mr.
leir
was
to
obtain
and
he
was
to
get
a
sales
commission.
all
of
the
money
of
the
venture
was
to
be
put
up
by
apex.
now,
apex
--
that
contract
was
in
1938.
it
was
a
period
of
about
two
years
before
apex
made
its
first
batch
of
ferrovanadium,
caused
largely
by
the
fact
that
the
french
company
that
was
to
instruct
it
from
the
process
was
unable
to
do
so
due
to
the
oncoming
of
the
war.
but
in
any
event,
during
that
period
of
two
years,
mr.
leir
made
certain
applications,
for
example,
the
vanadium
corporation
of
america,
my
client,
to
purchase
oxide.
but
at
that
time,
all
he
wanted
to
do
is
take
the
oxide
and
sell
it
abroad
at
a
higher
price.
they
refused
to
sell
it
to
him
so
that
during
that
period,
certainly,
his
entry
into
the
vanadium
business
here
could
not
have
suffered.
now,
after
apex
started,
they
made
oxide
up
until
the
fall
of
1941
for
a
period
of
about
a
year.
at
that
time,
they
had
a
fire
in
their
ferroalloy
plant
and
were
shutdown.
and
at
that
time
or
shortly
after
that,
they
decided
that
they
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
business
and
they
wanted
to
stop
this
contract
with
mr.
leir
and
they
wrote
a
letter
in
which
they
cited
many
reason
for
why
--
as
to
why
they
wanted
to
get
out
of
it
and
not
one
of
them
was
lack
of
oxide.
there
were
a
number
of
reasons
set
forth
such
as
the
fire
that
they
had
had,
that
the
process
had
been
unsatisfactory,
that
they
couldn't
control
their
dust
and
their
labor
was
making
a
fuss
that
they
were
dissatisfied
with
being
in
business
with
continental
anyway,
and
that
the
melting
of
secondary
aluminum,
which
was
a
very
important
part
of
the
war
effort
should
get
their
full
and
undivided
attention.
and
they
went
out
of
business.
now,
there
is
no
--
no
evidence
on
which
a
reasonable
inference
can
be
based
that
these
companies,
in
any
way,
contributed
to
the
apex
going
out
of
business.
for
example,
they
had
50,000
pounds
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
--
of
oxide.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
yes,
entirely
lack
of
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
i'm
arguing
lack
of
causation.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
in
other
words,
that
these
companies
did
not
cause
apex
to
go
out
of
business,
apex
being
mr.
leir's
supplier.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
and
we're
not
involved
in
causing
that.
after
apex
went
out
of
business,
mr.
leir
started
the
business
which
comes
into
this
canadian
situation.
i
won't
go
into
the
canadian
part
of
it.
but
that
was
the
--
he
tried
to
make
what
he
called
van-ex.
now,
van-ex
was
supposed
to
be
vanadium
oxide
which
could
be
introduced
directly
into
the
steel
bath
and
without
going
through
the
step
of
making
ferrovanadium.
but
the
undisputed
fact
showed
that
in
most
instances,
he
simply
bought
oxide
at
$1.10
and
incidentally,
these
defendants
never
fixed
the
price
of
oxide
during
all
this
period.
the
price
of
oxide
is
fixed
by
the
opa
and
the
ceiling
price
was
$1.10.
mr.
leir
bought
this
oxide
at
$1.10,
ground
it,
repackaged
it,
added
nothing,
although
in
several
instances,
he
added
a
little
fluorspar.
mostly,
he
added
nothing
and
resold
it
at
$1.34
or
24
cents
above
the
opa
ceiling
price
for
oxide.
that
was
the
van-ex
operation.
now,
during
the
entire
van-ex
operation,
as
the
court
below
found,
the
plaintiff
never
applied
to
the
defendants
for
oxide.
he
never
asked
for
any.
and
apparently,
he
had
money
because
he
carried
on
his
operations
in
van-ex.
then,
after
he
ceased
making
van-ex,
he
then
turned
to
climax
molybdenum
corporation
and
asked
them
--
made
a
contract
with
them
to
convert
20,000
pounds
of
oxide
into
ferrovanadium
for
him
for
him
to
sell,
and
climax
did
that.
they
carried
out
that
contract
and
obtained
the
oxide,
half
of
it
from
one
of
these
respondents
and
half
of
it
from
another
source.
and
then
the
last
venture
that
he
went
into
and
remember,
these
ventures
are
specifically
alleged
in
the
complaint
as
being
what
he
did
in
the
vanadium
business.
and
the
--
so,
that
he
--
in
the
last
venture,
he
tried
to
interest
a
company
called
imperial
paper
&
color
corporation
into
producing
oxide
and
ferrovanadium
and
this
was
in
1944.
early
in
1944,
he
made
this
contract
and
he
--
but
imperial
had
the
right
not
to
go
ahead
with
the
operation
unless
they
were
satisfied
that
their
primary
sources
of
raw
material
would
be
sufficient.
and
about
a
year
later,
they
decided
that
they
were
not.
there's
no
evidence
that
the
plaintiffs
caused
any
damage
in
that
instance.
now,
to
get
around
to
the
basic
legal
question
involved
in
two
of
the
questions
raised
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
proposition
put
forward
by
mr.
alioto
is,
if
you
have
evidence
or
if
you
prove
a
conspiracy
under
section
2
or
if
you
prove
a
violation
of
sections
1
or
2
of
the
sherman
act.
and
if
you
established
that
someone
who
is
in
the
business
got
out,
you
have
conclusively
proved
causation.
you
have
conclusively
proved
that
that
person
was
put
out
of
the
business
by
the
acts
of
those
defendants.
in
other
words,
assuming
a
monopoly
or
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
and
assuming
that
a
competitor
leaves
the
business,
that's
conclusive
proof
of
causation.
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
or
any
court
has
ever
gone
that
far.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
that's
approximately
what
they
argue
and
what
their
questions
pose,
your
honor.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
they
are
arguing
that
they
have
enough
evidence
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
--
to
go
to
a
jury,
but
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
no,
i
don't
think
they're
arguing
that
they
have
enough
evidence
of
causation
to
go
to
a
jury,
except
they
say
where
you
show
a
100%
control
or
a
dominating
control
of
an
industry,
you
show
that
the
defendants
wanted
to
put
the
--
you
introduce
some
evidence
that
the
defendants
wanted
to
put
the
plaintiffs
out
of
the
industry,
and
the
plaintiffs
go
out
of
the
industry.
you
don't
have
to
show
that
they
went
out
because
the
plaintiffs
put
them
out,
because
the
plaintiffs
caused
them
damage.
i
think
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
the
--
their
theory
and
the
way
they
tried
their
case
and
their
evidence
was
that
they
made
certain
ventures
into
the
vanadium
business,
that
all
of
those
who
were
forwarded
because
they
couldn't
get
vanadium
oxide.
now,
the
circuit
court,
judge
magruder
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
pardon
me?
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
well,
they
say
we
--
said
we
interfered
with
their
suppliers,
for
example,
and
they
couldn't
get
vanadium
oxide.
but
the
court
below
found
that
they
didn't
prove
any
damage
because
they
always
had
plenty
of
oxide
or
could
have
gotten
that.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
they
say
that
--
what
i
have
said,
that
they
don't
have
to
prove
that
the
fact
that
we
proved
then
that
the
only
evidence
and
the
evidence
of
the
plaintiffs
themselves
was
that
they
had
or
could
have
gotten
plenty
of
oxide
at
all
times,
that
that
fact
makes
no
difference.
that
they
don't
have
to
prove
causation.
they
simply
have
to
prove
a
monopoly
situation
and
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
went
out
of
the
business
and
it
will
be
assumed
because
there
was
this
monopoly
situation.
the
reasonable
assumption
is
they
went
out
of
the
business
because
that
was
the
situation.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
not
as
i
see
it,
your
honor,
and
not
as
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
they
claim
that
--
their
claim
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
they
claim
that
there's
this
evidence
that
we
--
that
there
is
evidence
that
we
conspired
to
monopolize,
that
one
of
the
objects
of
the
monopoly
was
to
put
plaintiffs
and
people
like
him
out
of
the
industry,
and
then
they
claim
he
went
out
of
the
industry.
they
say
if
you
have
that,
that's
all
you
need
to
prove.
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
we
caused
him
to
go
out
of
the
industry.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
they
claim
that
--
well,
they
--
or
nothing
except
the
plaintiff's
very
statement
that
that's
the
reason
he
went
onto
it.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
and
they
claim,
of
course,
that
we
refuse
to
sell
them
oxide.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
the
theory
that,
if
the
jury
found
that
a
violation
of
the
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act
--
1
or
2
of
the
sherman
act,
and
if
the
jury
found
that
that
had
an
impact
on
the
defendants,
a
similar
instruction
to
bigelow
was
given
by
the
lower
court,
then
they
were
to
find
--
they
could
find
for
the
plaintiffs.
i
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
first
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
that's
correct.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
that's
correct.
he
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
not
complete,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
90%
is
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
the
--
judge
magruder
so-found
after
an
examination
of
the
record.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
that
is
the
argument
here
and
he
so-found
after
an
examination
of
the
record,
because
he
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
undisputed
facts
in
the
record
show
that
the
plaintiffs
at
all
times
had
all
the
vanadium
oxide
they
wanted
or
could
have
had.
therefore,
we
couldn't
have
caused
him
to
go
out
of
business.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
well,
that's
--
that
is
an
inference
that
i
suppose
could
be
drawn.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
and
the
judge
in
the
court
below
said
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
he
had
plenty
of
oxide
and
we
didn't
cause
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
well,
i
think
perhaps
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
if
you
take
bigelow
where
the
plaintiff
was
refused
first-run
movies.
in
the
first
place,
the
first-run
movie
is
a
different
thing
from
a
tangible
product
like
vanadium
in
other
words,
movies
got
from
one
source
and
maybe
very
different
from
movies
gotten
from
someone
else.
but
assuming
you'd
take
bigelow
and
assume
you
were
dealing
with
a
tangible
product
like
vanadium
oxide
which
is
the
same
no
matter
where
you
buy
it
and
assume
that
contrary
to
bigelow,
the
plaintiff
at
all
times
had
or
could
have
had
all
the
vanadium
oxide
he
wanted
then
you
have
bigelow.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
he
couldn't
buy
it
or
he
claims
he
couldn't
buy
it
for
--
from
the
defendants,
but
the
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
the
evidence
showed
that
he
had
all
that
he
needed
and
had
plenty
of
sources
of
supply.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
well,
i
assume
that
he
was
trying
to
buy
it
anywhere
he
wanted
to.
but
he
certainly
had
plenty
of
sources
of
supply
and
plenty
of
them
were
available
to
him,
and
the
--
that
was
the
finding
of
the
circuit
court.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
i
would
say
if
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
--
if
several
other
flour
suppliers
were
driving
up
to
his
door
and
offering
him
flour
and
he
was
keeping
his
bins
full
or,
at
times,
he
was
saying
he
didn't
want
any
and
refusing
to
take
it,
that
they
could
find
that
that
wasn't
the
reason
he
went
out
a
of
business.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
if
he
--
if,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
could
get
what
he
wanted.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
the
fact
showed
that
he
had
plenty
of
flour
at
all
times.
that
is
the
point
of
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
that
the
--
that
one
element
of
causation
is
missing.
now,
also,
there
was
very
little
evidence
of
--
offered
as
to
his
major
damages
but
the
court
doesn't
even
go
into
that.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
essentially,
yes,
and
on
--
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
well,
i'll
have
to
--
can
i
supply
you
with
that
from
the
record?
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
i
certainly
shall.
yes
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
i
think
the
finding
of
the
lower
--
of
the
tenth
circuit
is
that
the
effect
showed
that
he
did
have
a
reliable
and
sufficient
source
of
supply
and
that,
at
the
time
he
alleged
he
went
out
of
business,
he
had
offers
of
ample
supplies.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
yes,
your
honor.
i'll
supply
a
memorandum
after.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
i
can't
find
it
right
now.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
if
the
court
will
permit
me
to
turn
the
argument
over
to
mr.
archer.
at
this
point,
i've
argued
about
half
the
time.
i
will
look
for
it
while
he's
arguing
and
try
to
give
it
to
you.
mr.
josiah
g.
holland
if
that's
satisfactory.
