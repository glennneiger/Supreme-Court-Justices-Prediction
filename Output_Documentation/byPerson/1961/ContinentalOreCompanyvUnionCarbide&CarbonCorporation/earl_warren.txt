mr.

chief

mr.
holland.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
ask
if
you're
--
if
you're
still
arguing
lack
of
causation
or
whether
you're
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
you're
arguing
if
there
was
no
conspiracy
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
lack
of
causation,
still,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
they
conceive
that
there
is
no
proof
of
causation,
no
evidence
of
causation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
they
claim
that
there
is
any
evidence
of
causation
in
this
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
i'm
talking
as
you
see
it,
but
do
they
claim
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
of
causation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
because
of
that
one
fact
and
nothing
else,
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
they
contend
that
there
is
any
evidence
in
there
to
show
that
they
were
put
out
of
business
in
this
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
the
petitioner
admit
that,
at
all
times,
he
had
ample
supply
of
vanadium?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
holland.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
can
you
find
a
portion
in
the
record
where
they
admit
that
they
have
a
reliable
supply
of
vanadium?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
couldn't
we
have
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
couldn't
we
have
it
during
the
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
a
very
important
thing.
one
of
your
associates
could
find
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
yes,
you
may.
mr.
archer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
archer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
why
is
it
hypothetical?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
have
to
assume
it
here
then,
don't
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
the
--
his
assumption
which
was
the
basis
of
his
conclusion
must
be
assumed
here
also,
must
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
i'm
talking
just
about
the
relationship
of
us
to
the
assumptions
of
the
court
of
appeals.
did
the
court
of
appeals
assume
something
to
be
a
fact
and
then
based
its
conclusion
on
that
assumption?
must
we
not
accept
that
assumption
also?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
archer,
as
i
understood
mr.
alioto,
when
he
went
to
this
electro
metallurgical
company
in
canada
and
tried
to
arrange
for
sales
of
this
vanadium,
that
he
was
referred
to
the
defendant,
union
carbide,
and
representative
of
that
company
called
him
up
and
said,
"now,
if
you
want
to
discuss
this
matter,
the
place
to
do
it
is
at
the
agent
of
the
union
carbide
in
new
york.”
and,
that
he
went
there
and
the
agent
of
union
carbide
said,
"now,
you
have
no
business
in
the
--
this
kind
of
business,
either
in
the
united
states
or
canada”
and
then,
went
on
to
indicate
to
him
some
reprisals
that
might
be
affected
if
he
did
continue
in
the
business.
now,
do
you
claim
immunity
from
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
may
--
and
i
may
have
misstated
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
may
have
misstated
it,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
still
understood
mr.
alioto.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
of
appeals
assume
that
that
part
of
the
plaintiff's
evidence
was
true
for
the
--
perhaps,
the
decision.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that
but
i'm
just
talking
about
the
assumption.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
it's
a
klor
case
to
decide
on,
but
we've
got
the
case.
it's
here,
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
point
is
simply
this.
unless
you
have
another
independent
ground
upon
which
it
can
be
decided,
if
the
judge
says,
“i
assume
that
such
and
such
is
the
fact
in
the
case
and
basing
my
judgment
on
that
assumption,
i
conclude
that
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
no
relief.”
when
it
comes
to
us,
are
we
not
--
are
we
not
bound
to
take
that
same
assumption
that
he
took
and
determine
whether
his
conclusion
on
that
point
was
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
if
there's
another
ground,
i
would
think
you
could.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
i
understand
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
alioto.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes,
if
you
will,
please.
just
a
moment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
we
were
talking
about,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
these
so-called
admissions
cover
the
entire
period
as
reliable
sources
supply
throughout?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
just
as
mr.
justice
white
was
asking
you
about
a
reliable
supply
and
whether
there
wasn't
a
difference
between
being
able
to
pick
up
some
--
maybe
in
here
and
some
there,
out
of
the
10%
that
they
don't
monopolize
and,
on
the
other
hand,
have
a
reliable
and
permanent
supply.
and
i
understood
you
to
say
that
they
had
admitted
that
they
did
have
a
reliable
permanent
supply.
chief
justice
earl
warren
throughout
the
whole
period?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
would
you
mind
responding
to
that
one
point
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
i
think
we'll
have
to
recess,
mr.
alioto.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
