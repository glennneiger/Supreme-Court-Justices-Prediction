was
it
a
private
antitrust
action?
justice

stewart
is
there
some
admission
in
the
record
that
the
petitioner
thought
he
had
a
reliable
supply
for
the
future
or
was
it
just
every
now
and
then
he
could
buy
from
somebody
else?
wasn't
--
isn't
the
reliability
of
a
future
supply
fairly
significant
element
in
the
business?

sending
this
case
back
to
the
district
court,
wouldn't
another
way
to
deal
with
it,
be
to
send
it
back
if
we
--
if
we
assume
that

it
back
to
the
court
of
