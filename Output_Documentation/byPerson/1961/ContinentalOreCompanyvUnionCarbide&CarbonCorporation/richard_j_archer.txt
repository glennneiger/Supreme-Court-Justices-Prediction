mr.
richard
j.
archer
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
i
represent
the
defendants,
respondents,
union
carbide
corporation
and
united
states
vanadium
corporation.
as
a
preliminary
matter,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
although
in
some
of
the
papers
there
are
several
companies
named
as
respondents
which
our
union
carbide
subsidiaries,
which
are
in
the
group,
are
the
electro
metallurgical
companies,
these
companies
were
never
served.
there
was
no
judgment
against
them,
of
course,
and
they
are
not
respondents
here.
i
really
want
to
discuss
two
things
having
to
do
with
what
occurred
in
canada.
first,
this
is
question
five
in
the
petition,
in
the
writ
of
certiorari
which
has
been
granted,
and
it's
our
posi
--
position
that
this
question,
as
it
arises
on
the
record
is
purely
hypothetical
in
this
case.
our
second
position
is
that
assuming
the
hypothetical
question
which
has
been
posed,
there
is
--
that
the
law
is,
under
--
on
the
basis
of
parker
against
brown,
olsen
against
smith,
rock
royal
and
noerr
motor
freight,
that
the
question
of
law
was
correctly
decided
below.
i
would
like
to
go,
first
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
that's
the
first
point
i
want
to
take.
this
arises
--
let
me,
first,
state
what
the
claim
is.
the
claim
is,
in
1942,
the
plaintiff
was
selling
vanadium
oxide
to
atlas
steels,
a
customer
in
canada.
in
1943,
the
metals
controller
of
canada
took
over
all
metals.
there
were
chemical
controllers
and
so
forth.
as
part
of
this,
he
appointed
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada,
which
is
not
a
defendant
here,
his
agent
to
receive
allocations
of
vanadium
from
the
war
production
board
in
the
united
states
and
allocate
them
in
canada
according
to
the
orders
of
the
metal
controller.
now,
this
is
in
the
plaintiff's
offer
of
proof.
this
isn't
anything
we
proved.
this
is
in
the
offer
of
proof
that
plaintiff
made
below.
then,
the
claim
is
that
after
he
appointed
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada,
first,
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada
was
a
union
carbide
subsidiary.
it
was
a
canadian
corporation.
after
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada
made
its
arrangements
to
get
vanadium
into
canada,
then
it
refused
to
buy,
after
the
first
shipment
from
the
plaintiff
here.
now,
the
point
i
--
the
reason
why
i
say
this
is
hypothetical
is
because
there's
nothing
in
the
offer
of
proof
that
connects
these
respondents
with
the
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada.
there
is
no
evidence
that
union
carbide
exerted
any
domination,
control,
or
influence
other
--
over
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada
other
than
the
fact
that
it
was
wholly
own
subsidiary.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
court
below
assumed
--
it
assumed
--
it
actually
made
it
into
two
assumptions
before
reaching
this
point.
but
it
did
assume
that
the
defendants
had
control
union
--
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada
but
it
said
it
was
making
that
assumption.
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
that
assuming
that
to
be
the
case,
there
is
still
no
liability
because
of
noerr
motor
freight.
i
think
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
on
any
ground.
it
may
be
that
it
has
to
be
assumed.
but
the
basic
question
is,
it
seems
to
me,
was
the
trial
court
correct
in
excluding
this
evidence?
mr.
richard
j.
archer
well,
i
--
the
--
when
--
i
objected
to
this
evidence
in
the
trial
court
under
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
well,
as
i
understand
the
cases,
this
is
not
necessarily
true
that
if
and
i
pose
this
situation.
one
of
my
transfer
to
--
of
objecting
to
all
these
was
that
it
was
hearsay,
although
it's
been
stated
that
the
man
who
made
this
conversation
was
a
managing
agent,
this
is
not
admitted.
there
was
no
authority.
he
was
not
connected
with
union
carbide.
there's
no
evidence
that
he
had
any
authority
to
speak
for
union
carbide.
the
only
evidence
was
that
he
had
an
office.
so
it
would
seem
to
that
if
the
court
would
say,
"well,
we
will
make
the
same
assumption
and
send
it
back
down
for
trial.”
and
it
turns
out
that
all
the
evidence
is
inadmissible
hearsay
then
it
would
seem
to
be
a
waste
of
time.
now,
let
me
put
it
just
a
little
bit
differently.
if
the
trial
court,
when
an
offer
of
proof
is
made,
is
able
to
reject
it
on
any
other
traditional
grounds
that
evidence
is
rejected
in
the
court,
as
well
as
on
this
point,
and
he
does
reject
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
decision
is
right,
and
we
can
affirm
it
on
the
ground
that
the
decision
was
right.
we
refer
to
story
parchment
and
several
cases
along
this
line
in
our
brief.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
it
should
consider
upon
the
merits
respondents
additional
ground
for
sustaining
the
judgment
below
which
was
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
an
antitrust
violation.
that's
a
different
kind
of
point.
but
although
we
have
not
petitioned
here,
we
oppose
this
point
in
our
response
to
the
petition
on
the
ground
that
this
point
was
not
merely
raised.
i
think
it
has
another
aspect
to
it
because
when
you
get
to
noerr
motor
freight
and
that
kind
of
case,
and
the
record
in
this
case
is
so
sparse,
it
shows
no
communication,
for
instance,
from
union
carbide
to
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada.
and
unless
this
court
desires,
for
instance,
to
reexamine
noerr
motor
freight
and
parker
against
brown,
it
would
have
to
have
some
basis
in
the
record
for
distinguishing,
it
seems
to
me
what
happened
in
canada.
and
in
as
much
as
the
proof,
as
we
say,
the
issue
that's
here
is
purely
hypothetical.
the
communication
here
is
general
from
the
--
between
the
respondents
and
the
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada
which
was
not
a
respondent
or
even
with
the
metals
controller
of
canada,
which
would
certainly
not
be
binding,
in
any
sense,
upon
the
defendants
in
this
case
who
was
all
inadmissible
hearsay,
but
assuming
that
all
to
be
admissible,
it
still
does
not
prove
the
final
point
that
these
respondents
communicated
with
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada.
accordingly,
it
seems
if
the
court
is
going
to
face
a
difficult
problem
like
this,
it
should
have
a
more
complete
record.
something
that
it
could
reach
a
decision
on
and
that's
--
well,
that
is
fundamentally
our
point
there.
and,
as
i
say,
we
set
out
the
cases
in
the
brief
and
say,
as
a
matter
of
supreme
court
procedure,
it
is
proper
to
raise
a
defense
like
this.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
yes.
i
would
say
it
in
this
way,
mr.
justice
black.
we
say,
first,
we
take
the
question,
does
the
act
of
elec
--
is
the
act
of
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada,
in
canada,
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
we
examine
that
in
several
other
cases
and
then,
we
come
to
the
conclusion
in
our
brief
that
it
does.
then,
in
replying
to
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
pardon?
mr.
richard
j.
archer
the
sherman
act.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
in
other
words,
this
just
--
let's
take
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada,
acting
as
agent
for
the
metals
controller.
there
is
no
question
about
what
they
had
a
--
a
monopoly
of
the
purest
sort.
they
not
only
--
they
had
the
government
behind
them,
the
war
production
board.
the
only
vanadium
that
went
into
canada
was
allocated
there
by
the
war
production
board.
when
it
got
there,
it
was
allocated
according
to
the
orders
of
the
metals
controller,
who
is
a
government
official.
now,
if
i
may
say
that
the
offer
of
proof
in
the
court
below
was
in
this
--
i'd
like
to
state
the
facts
a
little
bit
so
i
can
answer
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
in
the
lower
court,
counsel
for
the
petitioners
made
this
contention,
"the
crux
of
my
contention
is,
it
comes
down
to
this,
that
this
defendant,
as
an
agent
for
the
canadian
government,
used
that
agency
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
trade
and
participating
in
a
conspiracy
to
eliminate
the
continental
ore
company
from
the
canadian
market."
mr.
richard
j.
archer
well,
it
really
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
yes,
well,
there
was
only
one
defendant
that
was
an
agent
for
the
canadian
government.
that
was
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada,
and
that's
why
i
say
that
the
title
of
the
court
lists
all
these
people
as
defendants
but
they
really
weren't
defendants,
and
then
you'll
find
some
further
discussion
with
the
trial
judge
about
this.
the
trial
judge
says,
"well,
if
the
defendant
wasn't
served
or
the
company
wasn't
served,
you
can't
call
him
a
defendant.”
this
was
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada.
so
then,
we
say
that
this
court
has
decided
in
such
cases
as
parker
against
brown,
u.s.
against
rock
royal,
olsen
against
smith,
that
the
agent
itself
or
the
private
agent
for
the
government
does
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
we
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
yes.
yes,
exactly.
we
would
say,
we
do
not
claim
any
immunity
for
what
happened
in
the
united
states.
we
claim
no
immunity
for
what
happened
in
the
united
states.
as
mr.
holland
says,
we
say
anything
we
did
in
united
states
just
didn't
injure
the
plaintiff.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
suppose
the
shot
came
across
the
border
that,
your
honor,
would
be
a
case
we
don't
have
to
decide
here
because
the
contention
was,
in
the
court
below
in
the
offer
of
proof
was
that
the
canadian
subsidiary
refused
to
buy
vanadium
form
the
plaintiff.
it
isn't
a
question
of
a
shot
coming
across
the
border,
so
then
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
of
union
carbide.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
that's
right.
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada
was
a
subsidiary
of
union
carbide.
it
was
asked
by
the
government
to
act
as
its
agent.
now,
when
it
refused,
the
petitioners
here
wrote
to
the
metals
controller
and
protested
and
said,
"it
is
not
the
intent
of
this
program
to
create
a
monopoly
in
canada."
now,
in
reply
to
that
letter,
i
think
the
metals
controller
wrote
to
the
plaintiff
here
and
it
referred,
first,
to
mr.
davis,
i
say
so
the
letter
is
clear,
a
letter
of
mr.
davis
of
one
of
the
steel
mills
had
written.
and
then,
as
i
say,
after
this
charge
had
been
--
monopoly
had
been
made
by
the
petitioners
here
to
the
canadian
government,
the
me
--
metals
controller
of
the
department
of
munitions
and
supply
said,
"in
mr.
davis'
reply
to
you
of
the
24th,
it
is
not
made
evident,
possibly
it
is
not
known
to
mr.
davis,
that
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada
was
requested
by
the
metals
controller
to
place
its
facilities
at
the
disposal
of
canada.
by
the
arrangement
now
in
being,
electro
metallurgical
company
is
required
to
finance
and
to
purchase
vanadium
products
allocated
to
canada
by
the
war
production
board
and
to
store
and
distribute
this
allocation
as
desired
by
the
metals
controller.
this
is
done
at
no
cost
to
canada.”
now,
then,
it
is
our
position
that
the
sherman
act
does
not
apply
to
this
kind
of
activity.
we
cite,
in
addition,
the
other
line
of
cases
which
involved
other
kinds
of
activity
which
might
otherwise
be
torts
that
the
rule
where
this
court
will
not
sit
or
american
courts
do
not
sit
in
judgment
of
the
acts
of
other
governments
done
within
their
territories.
now
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
i
would
say
that
they
probably
could
that
it
would
have
no
application
in
our
case.
the
only
immunity
we
are
claiming
is
a
private
company
that's
acting
as
an
agent
for
the
government
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
not
for
the
private
contractors.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
well,
to
--
the
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
this.
they
say,
"no,
we
are
not
seeking
it."
now,
again,
electro
--
against
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada,
they
say
that
because
union
carbide
and
this
is
where
i
say
it's
hypothetical,
because
union
carbide
and
vca
supposedly
influenced
the
governmental
agent
to
do
this
kind
of
thing.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
this
is--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
this
is
a
position
we
take
in
our
brief
that,
insofar
as
it's
the
governmental
act
which
does
the
injury,
it's
the
resulting
act
of
the
government
which
does
that
injury,
and
it's
--
that
the
influencing
of
the
government
doesn't
do
the
injury,
and
that's
not
alleged
here,
that
if
we
say
there
is
no
liability
in
that
situation
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
that's
right.
we
say
that
if
it's
a
political
act,
in
other
words,
we
read
noerr
as
involving
not
only
legislative
lobbying
but
attempt
--
attempts
to
influence
state
tax
commissions,
road
commissions,
directors
of
highway
and
even
the
governor.
and,
the
court
said
that
because,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
because
this
was
a
political
matter,
that
when
these
--
when
the
people
influenced
these
various
administrative
officials,
an
injury
there
--
damages
would
not
be
awarded
there
from
because
it
was
not
covered
by
the
sherman
act,
that
it
didn't
intend
to
create
it.
to
me,
it
would
be
just
exactly
as
though
forgetting
the
act
of
state
cases
during
world
war
ii
if
several
companies
had
come
to
donald
nelson
and
had
convinced
him
that
they
deserved
perser
--
preserved
treat
--
preferred
treatment
and
received
it.
i
would
not
think
this
would
be
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
i
don't
think
that
the
sherman
act
was
intended
to
apply
to
this
kind
of
thing.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
it
would
be
completely
unworkable
because
particularly
in
a
private
treble-damage
action,
because
in
order
to
cover
--
recover
damages,
understand
we
claim
immunity
only
for
what
results
from
that
government's
act.
in
other
words,
if
donald
nelson
then,
thereupon,
went
and
did
something
and
somebody
claimed
injury
from
that,
in
order
to
recover
in
a
treble-damage
action,
he
would
have
to
impugn
the
integrity
of
the
particular
governmental
official
and,
in
effect,
invalidate
the
act.
and,
to
me,
this
would
result
in
a
--
in
applying
the
sherman
act
to
a
kind
of
activity
to
which
had
historically
has
not
been
applied.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
claim
that
that
occurred.
i
do
not
agree
that
that
occurred.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
i
think
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
i
think
it
--
well,
this
offer
of
proof,
your
honor,
consists
of
a
series
of
correspondence
and
if
you'll
--
if
the
court
will
look
at
cor--
series
of
correspondence,
the
reference
from
canada
is
a
letter
by
the
plaintiff
here
which
says
his
lawyer,
mr.
edmond
cole,
went
to
the
metals
controller,
mr.
bateman
of
canada
who
--
mr.
bateman
told
mr.
cole
to
tell
mr.
leir
to
go
to
electro
metallurgical
company
in
new
york.
this
was
in
january
1943
when
it
first
started.
so,
this
is
double
hearsay
to
begin
with.
in
other
words,
this
reference
to
electro
metallurgical
company
in
canada
was
made
through
mr.bateman
to
mr.
cole,
neither
of
whom
i
could
ever
cross-examine
because
i
feel
strongly
about
this,
naturally.
but,
what
the
result
was,
the
next
letter
from
mr.
leir
then
refers
to
the
conversation
he
had
and
says,
“you
referred
me
to
welland,”
which
is
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada.”
in
other
words,
the
conversation
he
had
referred
him
to
welland.
the
next
letter
he
gets
from
electro
metallurgical
company
in
welland
says,
“electro
metallurgical
company
in
new
york
has
referred
to
me
your
correspondence.”
and
then,
your
honor,
there
is
six
months
correspondence
on
this
whole
subject
between
the
plaintiff,
continental
ore
and
electro
metallurgical
company
in
welland
for
all
this
complaint
is
made.
they
have
this
letter
from
the
metals
controller
saying
that
this
is
just
what
occurred,
and
it
was
after
that
the
alleged
conversation
was
offered
as
to
this
clerk
in
new
york
who
had
originally
referred
them
up
there,
and
we
say
this
clerk
in
new
york
had
no
authority
to
speak
for
electro
metal
in
welland,
electro
metal
in
canada,
much
less
the
respondents
in
the
case,
union
carbide
and
united
states
vanadium
corporation.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
yes,
expressly.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
expressly,
although
we
had
argued
in
both
ways
and
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
--
and
to
make
it
clear,
i
had
objected
in
the
trial
court,
too
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
--
on
the
ground,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
that's
right,
but
it's
--
that's
why
i
say
i
think
that
this
--
of
course
this
is
--
it's
a
matter
of
supreme
court
procedure,
i
know,
as
to
how
these
are
handled.
but
it
seems
to
me
that,
with
this
factual
background,
it's
a
very
poor
case
to
decide
something
which
may
have
so
much
importance.
these
act
of
state
cases
for
instance,
are
involved
here.
it
goes
back
to
american
banana.
and,
as
i
say,
if
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
that
i
pose
that
assuming
that
the
communications
were
in
existence,
if
two
companies
had
gone
to
donald
nelson
during
the
time
of
war,
the
war
production
board
got
favored
act.
whether
this
would
have
violated
the
sherman
act,
i
think,
is
a
difficult
question,
and
maybe
it's
an
important
question.
i
don't
think
it's
difficult
in
view
of
the
cases
which
have
been
decided.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
well,
that's--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
it
was
--
as
i
read
the
cases,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
--
i
don't
think
you
have
to,
that
i
think
that
i
can
sustain
a
ruling
of
a
trial
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
even
though
it
was
given
for
the
wrong
reason,
and
--
in
other
words,
there
may
--
he
--
the
court
of
appeals--
i
may
have
think--
of
course
i
think
he
was
right
in
his
conclusion.
but
i
can
sustain
it
on
any
ground
that
it's
supportable
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
well,
as
i
say,
i
think
i
--
that
a
ground
in
the
record,
not
necessarily
in
the
opinion,
and
i
think
it
is
in
the
record.
this
offer
of
proof
is
all
in
the
record,
and
i
think
if
it
is
raised
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
it
is
both
incompetent
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
--
and
does
not
prove
what
it
is
supposed
to
prove.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
nothing
of
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
in
1944,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
i
do
not
know
if,
at
that
time,
they
still
had.
i
do
know
that
the
man
mr.brevin
who
handled
this
was
not
a
union
carbide
employee.
whether
there
were
other
directors
in
common
at
the
--
the
record
doesn't
show.
i'm
sure
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
or
officers.
there's
no
--
i'm
--
that
the
only
evidence
on
the
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada
is
briefly
what
i've
recited
here
and
it's
all
in
this
offer
of
proof
and
in
these
letters.
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
--
in
other
words,
none
of
the
traditional
ways
that
show
me
domination
or
controller
alter-ego
appear
in
the
record
or
even
--
mr.
richard
j.
archer
as
far
as
the
act
of
injury
is
concerned.
mr.
richard
j.
archer
the
act
of
injury
that
the
lost
of
the
canadian
business
was
due
solely
to
this,
your
honor.
that's
what
i
say
the
record
shows.
that
there
was
nothing
else
having
to
and
--
there
was
no
other
communication
between
any
of
the
respondents
and
the
petitioner
with
regard
to
canada
other
than
this
refusal
of
electro
metallurgical
company
of
canada,
as
agent.
i
believe
i
quoted
the
crux
of
the
offer
of
proof
as
--
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument.
and
that,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
they
refused
to
buy
as
agent
for
the
canadian
government.
i
believe
that's
all,
mr.
holland
has
