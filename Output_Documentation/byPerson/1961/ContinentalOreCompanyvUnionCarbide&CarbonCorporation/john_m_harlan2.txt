the
case
went
to
the
jury
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

what
happened
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
a
difference?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
ourselves
over
impart
of
the
errors
and
instructions
contemplated
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
deal
with
the
american
banana
contention
i
think.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would
mean
if
you
take
that
theory
--
assuming
you
lose
on
the
rest
of
the
case
that
will
mean
that
the
retrial
be
confined
simply
to
the
america
--
to
the
canadian
exclusions
so
far?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
afraid
i
don't
follow
that
because
the
premise
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
been
in
this
that
the
conspiracy
monopolize
that
you
assert
is
accepted
as
the
premise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
it
reversed
because
they
said
on
the
element
of
--
of
causation
on
the
living
out
canadian
business,
you
have
proved
the
case.
i
don't
know
if
we
should
reverse
on
this
canadian
business.
i
don't
see
how
that
brings
revivifies
the
causation
--
your
position
on
causation,
assuming
that
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
do
we
find
in
these
rather
massive
briefs,
the
discussion
on
both
sides
as
to
the
in
instructions
of
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
all
the
instructions
that
you
say
that
you're
complaining
about
the
court
of
appeals
bypass.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
continue.
