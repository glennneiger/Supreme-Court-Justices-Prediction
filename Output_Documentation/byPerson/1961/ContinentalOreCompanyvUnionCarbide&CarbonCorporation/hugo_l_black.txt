justice

do
they
argue
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
they
argued
it
was
a
--
they
had
enough
evidence
to
go
to
a
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
differed
in
it
this
to
between
argument
inclusiveness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
that.
what
you're
saying
is
that
they
didn't
have
enough
evidence
to
submit
to
the
jury
the
question
of
whether
what
was
done
--
what
they
had
done
entitled
the
jury
to
find
that
that
was
the
reason
they
went
out
of
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
else
did
they
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
else
was
decided
that
they
couldn't
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
theory
then
did
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
theory
was
submitted
to
the
jury
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
--
if
what
they
say
was
that
proof
in
page
8
of
their
brief
is
quite
different
to
what
you
say
they're
depending
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
i
gather
it,
that
they
say
that
there
was
evidence
from
several
people
that
carbide
said
they
didn't
want
to
sell
him
vanadium
because
they
want
to
keep
him
out
of
business,
that
they
refused
to
sell
him
vanadium?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
refuse
to
sell
it
to
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
they
had
complete
control
of
the
monopoly
in
the
field?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
90%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
that
wouldn't
be
enough
evidence
for
a
jury
to
find
that
the
cause
of
their
being
put
out
of
business
was
the
effort
of
the
carbide
company
to
put
them
out
of
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
argument
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
he
trying
to
buy
it
from
the
carbide
company?
why
was
he
trying
to
buy
it
from
the
carbide
company
and
why
did
the
carbide
company
refuse
to
sell
it
to
him
on
the
grounds
they
want
to
put
him
out
of
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
is
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
quotes
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
question
here
is
not
what
the
judge
below
in
the
court
of
appeals,
whether
that's
enough
evidence
to
go
to
a
jury
for
them
to
find
that
they
were
put
out
of
business
because
the
people
that
said
they
were
trying
to
put
him
out
of
business
refused
to
sell
him
the
product.
they
didn't
sell
them
to
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
assume
that
though
if
he
was
trying
to
buy
a
vanadium
and
couldn't
buy
it
because
they
wouldn't
sell
it
to
him
because
they
want
to
put
him
out
of
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then,
how
can
you
assume
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
could
was
the
indic
--
is
there
indication,
is
there
argument
that
he
was
trying
to
buy
it
from
carbide
although
he
didn't
need
it
and
didn't
want
it
for
his
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
a
merchant
in
a
city
wanted
to
buy
flours
and
he
showed
that
someone
who
had
90%
of
the
flour
refused
to
sell
to
him
and
continued
to
refuse
to
sell
to
him,
and
that
was
the
evidence.
finally,
he
kept
on
trying
to
buy
from
them
and
they
refused
to
sell
to
him
and
then
he
went
broke.
would
you
say
that
a
jury
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
infer
from
that?
he
couldn't
--
because
he
couldn't
get
flour
that
they
couldn't
find
that
he
had
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
cause
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
suppose
it
showed
that,
during
that
time
that
he
was
constantly
trying
to
buy
from
this
company
and
couldn't
get
it.
wouldn't
a
jury
have
a
right
to
find
something
from
that
with
reference
to
he's
not
being
able
to
get
what
he
wanted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
would
mean
that
the
jury
would
have
to
find
that
he
was
not
acting
in
earnest
when
he
was
trying
to
buy
this
because
he
didn't
need
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i
mean,
that's
very
important.
i
think
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
very
vital
part
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
exactly
why
--
what
it
is
you
claim
noerr
on
how
it
controls
this
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
not
violation
of
the
law
of
what
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
not
violate
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
wanted
to
hear.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
defendant
was
that
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
defendant?
he
says
this
defendant,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
mean
that
the
private
company
can
combine
with
an
agent
of
that
kind
and
that
he's
immunized
from
his
violation
to
the
antitrust
act
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he's
combined
with
an
agent
of
canada?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
asking
you,
try
to
find
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
shot
came
across
the
border?
justice
hugo
l.
black
canadian
subsidiary
of
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
a
subsidiary
of
union
carbide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
to
find
out
how
far
this
goes.probably
this
is
altogether
different,
that's
the
reason
i'm
asking
you.
number
of
companies
have
contract
with
the
federal
government
to
produce
certain
things
for
the
government.
they
have
rather
large
contracts
among
them.
suppose
they
would
combine
with
outside
companies
to
violate
the
sherman
act,
that
is
to
prevent
competition,
would
--
could
they
be
prosecuted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
asking
for
a
judgment
against
that
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you.
you
start
out
by
saying,
as
we
held
that
governmental
action,
where
the
government
has
a
right
to
act
in
territory
where
it
has
the
right
to
act,
does
not
violate
the
sherman
act
even
though
it
may
result
in
the
suppression
of
trade.
and
you
say
that
there's
nothing
in
this
offer
or
proof
that
has
been
made,
nothing
except
something
that
would
tend
to
show
the
government
of
canada
has,
by
reason
of
persuasion
of
for
some
other
cause,
decided
that
vanadium
in
canada
should
be
sold
only
on
certain
conditions
even
though
it
suppresses
somebody
right
to
trade
in
canada.
and
you
say
there's
nothing
in
the
offer
of
proof
except
that.

justice

the
what?
justice

black
what
was
the
page
of
that
brief?
justice
hugo
l.

is
there
any
evidence
in
all
of
that
shows
they
refused
to
do
it
on
the
ground
that
would
violate
the
rules
or
regulations
or
the
laws?
justice
hugo

black
are
you
arguing
--
are
you
arguing,
i
do
not
quite
understand
your
answer
to
his
argument.
are
you
arguing
that
if
they
conspired
together
to
abuse
the
government
of
canada
to
act
validly
under
its
laws
in
a
way
that
require
you
from
getting
what
you
wanted
but
that
would
violate
our
antitrust?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
accept
--
do
you
accept
then
the
holding
of
noerr
as
meaning
that
you
cannot
sue
them
for
a
conspiracy
simply
to
abuse
canada
to
pass
valid
laws
or
promulgate
valid
regulations
which
would
injure
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
evidence
is
broader
than
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
brief
you
--
in
the
brief
you
say
that
your
offer
of
proof
and
your
evidence
establishes
the
fact,
not
that
canada
barred
forced
them
to
do
what
they
did,
what
did
the
company
and
its
officials
through
that,
and
by
all
motions
free
from
the
canadian
compulsion
under
valid
law
took
the
step
they
did
that
interferes
with
new
competitors.
