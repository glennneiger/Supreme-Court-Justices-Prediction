justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
have
others
hired
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
do
what
the
people
is
going
to
afford
us
--
are
permitted
to
have
counsel
on
appeal
(inaudible),
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
have
any
agents
preparing
the
brief,
although
people
would
--
had
been
afforded
to
that,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
other
defendants
reported
have
--
have
counsel
to
help
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
evidence
of
the
record
that
the
one
defendant
ever
saw
the
briefs
that
were
filed
or
ever
saw
the
record
or
ever
knew
what
could
be
said
on
his
behalf?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
douglas
sign
that
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
no
evidence
he
ever
saw
the
brief
or
ever
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
is
being
said
on
his
behalf.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
record
says
it
doesn't
–
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
you
represented
meyes,
and
he's
not
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you're
saying
that
the
--
these
two
people
should
not
only
have
had
counsel
but
they
should
have
had
a
separate
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
didn't
have
any
counsel
at
all
during
the
trial
after
a
certain
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
also
saying
that
they
should
have
had
counsel
on
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
you're
right
in
the
latter
point,
doesn't
it
make
these
other
points
irrelevant
here
in
the
sense
that
there
should
have
been
an
appeal
in
the
state
courts
with
the
assistance
of
counsel
who
had
considered
these
and
the
california
courts
themselves
might
correct
these
other
errors
that
you're
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
an
affirmance
of
the
conviction
in
an
appellate
process
where
these
two
defendants
had
no
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
saying
that
they
should
have
had
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
saying
they
should
have
had
counsel
because
it
would
have
had
them
more
chance
in
getting
the
conviction
reversed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
it
be
for
both
of
them?
you're
saying
that
there
should
have
been
separate
counsel
but
both
of
them
discharged
them
--
discharged
the
lawyer.
it
looks
to
me
like
the
--
the
first
fellow
who
discharged
them
--
one
of
the
other
of
them
hasn't
got
a
point
on
that.
he
was
certainly
--
you
have
to
get
to
some
other
point
besides
conflict
to
say
that
--
that
the
public
defender
wasn't
qualified
to
represent
one
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
do
you
agree
or
not
that
the
conflict
point
only
goes
to
one
of
the
other
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
meyes
did
the
discharge
here
except
for
another
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
other
three?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently,
you're
saying
that
the
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
mean
the
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
counsel,
there's
going
to
be
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
point
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
the
point
is
there's
going
to
be
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
counsel
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
the
public
defender
has
to
ask
the
judge,
does
he,
to
get
an
outside
counsel
appointed?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
public
defender
--
the
public
defender
can't
just
say,
“i
am
withdrawing
from
representation
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know,
but
the
judge
automatically
--
this
does
not
automatically
take
his
word
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
your
point
--
your
point
is
that
there
was
a
review
on
the
merits
and
a
full
review
on
the
merits
and
the
fact
that
the
defendants
did
not
have
a
counsel
on
appeal
is
relevantly
insignificant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
(voice
overlap)
says
the
appellate
court
went
through
was
not
just
a
process
of
deciding
whether
or
not
the
points
were
frivolous
or
ordinary
appeal.
these
points
that
were
raised
didn't
merit
the
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
consider
--
you
don't
make
any
point
that
these
points
were
frivolous,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
these
were
points
of
narrative
review.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
the
appellate
court
really
treated
these
appeals
as
on
behalf
of
both
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
the
state
supreme
court
do
the
same
thing
on
the
request
for
certiorari
in
that
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
on
behalf
of
both
of
them?
