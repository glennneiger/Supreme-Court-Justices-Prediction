justice
potter
stewart
mr.
james,
am
i
right
in
my
understanding
that
california
prepares
a
record
on
appeal
for
appellants
of
criminal
cases
whether
or
not
they're
indigent?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
expense
of
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
done
automatically
when
--
when
a
notice
of
appeal
is
filed?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
done
upon
motion,
i
suppose
you
should
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
trial
court.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
one
of
these
men
was
(inaudible)
and
the
other
was
in
folsom.
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
they?
119
miles
apart?
isn't
that
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
neither
one
was
represented
by
counsel?
and
under
your
rule
35,
there
is
only
one
copy
of
the
record
made
available
to
both
to
these
men
together?
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
fact
the
matters.
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
they
have
point
--
they
appeared
jointly
as
petitioners,
there
one
whole
concept
of
their
cases
if
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
between
them.
justice
potter
stewart
the
claim
it's
traditionally
made
in
the
trial
of
a
case
with
a
--
criminal
defendant
is
not
represented
by
a
lawyer,
if
the
claim
was
made
then
well,
you
have
a
very
fair
judge
who's
going
to
protect
all
the
defendants'
rights.
that's
basically
the
same
thing
you're
making
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
you're
on
appeal,
on
a
review
of
a
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
review
of
a
criminal
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
man
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
did
these
petitioners
request
counsel
on
their
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
fairly,
they
did
request?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
mitchelson,
that
was
the
appeal
from
the
murder
trial,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
that
trial,
the
statement
that
you
read
had
to
do
with
dispute
between
the
two
as
to
who
had
been
the
--
who
has
pulled
the
trigger.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
that
trial,
each
was
represented
by
separate
counsel,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
these
are
what
burglary
or
robbery.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
because
there
was
a
conflict
in
that
case
and
they
did
have
separate
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
but
how
does
that
bear
on
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
this
burglary
and
robbery
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
get
that
into
a
burglary
around
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
court
directs
itself
only
to
that
question
and
you
prevailed
the
result
would
be
only
that
i
suppose
that
california
would
allow
an
appeal
with
counsel
and
there's
no
--
there's
no
guarantee
at
all
that
the
--
that
the
california
supreme
court
or
district
court
of
appeal
would
not
still
affirm
the
conviction,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you'd
be
back
here
again
with
your
first
point.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
isn't
that
quite
possible
from
that?
justice
potter
stewart
probably.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
a
week
later,
he
comes
back
and
says,
“i'm
still
not
prepared,
your
honor”?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
almost
100
judges
in
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles.
justice
potter
stewart
about
20
of
them
assigned
to
criminal
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
rotate
--
i
mean
they're
not
--
are
they
permanent
criminal
judges
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
understand
it
under
california
law,
if
the
court
had
appointed
a
separate
lawyer
from
the
public
defender's
office
for
meyes
or
for
douglas,
in
other
words,
it
had
appointed
two
different
lawyers
but
both
of
them
from
public
defender's
office,
that
would
have
been
--
that
wouldn't
have
solved
the
problem
at
all
because
their
cases
would
say
that's
the
same
law
firm.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
fully
reviewed
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it
follows
what
you
say,
i
think,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
court
--
this
court
goes
through
that
in
a
couple
of
dozen
cases
every
week.
we
have
petitions
for
certiorari
filed
by
people
in
the
penitentiary,
that
don't
have
any
help
of
counsel
at
all
and
we
dispose
those
petitions
one
way
or
the
other,
but
no
argument
and
there's
no
counsel
representing
the
petitioner.
justice
potter
stewart
and
everybody
does
have
a
right
to
appeal
including
a
pauper,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
they
haven't
done
any
earlier
continuances.
justice
potter
stewart
alibis
of
murder
trials
would
have
been
quite
different.
there
maybe
an
entirely
different
witnesses
perhaps,
because
the
murder
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
lying
in
wait.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
to
what
witnesses
testified.
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
it
be
cheaper
to
give
them
separate
trial
than
to
appoint
private
counsel
that
kind
of
thing?
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
this
case
but
that
is
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
these
are
the
alibi
witnesses
for
the
robberies.
justice
potter
stewart
the
robbery
victims.
justice
potter
stewart
the
prosecution
witnesses.
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
say
its
appeal
is
not
automatic,
you
don't
mean
that
there
--
there
is
not
an
absolute
right
to
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
this
paid
for
by
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
of
whether
the
appellant
is
indigent?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
every
case,
there's
an
absolute
right
to
appeal
upon
--
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
an
automatic
preparation
of
the
record
statement
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
the
practice
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
to
make
a
reference
to
the
local
bar
association
to
evaluate?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
second
trial
for
meyes,
am
i
right?
justice
potter
stewart
hung
jury
as
to
both.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
