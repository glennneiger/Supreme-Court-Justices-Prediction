mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
associate
justices,
let
me
state
this
as
to
the
court's
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
a
conflict
of
interest.
i
have
the
occasion
to
represent
mr.
douglas
in
two
murder
trials.
one
was
a
hung
jury.
one
was
an
acquittal
in
his
behalf.
now,
all
these
witnesses
that
testified
in
this
robbery
trial
and
these
witnesses,
they
were
cross-examined
by
anyone.
they
all
testified
in
those
murder
trials
and
they
were
thoroughly
cross-examined
your
honors.
and
it's
even
admitted
in
the
transcript,
we
have
before
us,
by
mr.
carr,
the
prosecuting
attorney
that
all
of
these
witnesses
were
thoroughly
cross-examined.
and
i
state
to
this
honorable
court
that
many
of
these
witnesses
were
impeached.
now,
mr.
carr's
theory
that
there
was
no
conflict,
mr.
carr,
the
prosecutor
that
is,
and
he
was
also
the
prosecutor
in
the
three
murder
cases,
is
that
both
of
the
defendants
denied
participation
in
any
of
the
robberies.
well,
they
both
denied
the
murder
charges,
too,
your
honors.
but
yet,
they
were
separate
of
counsel
for
each
defendant.
and
one
received
an
acquittal
and
the
other
one
received
a
conviction.
now,
i
say
to
you,
your
honors
that
the
conflict
simply
is,
that
the
stigma
of
meyes'
conviction
for
murder
rubs
off
on
douglas.
and
i
know
from
my
own
12
weeks
experience
in
trial
that
many
of
the
witnesses
identified
one
party
but
they
did
not
identify
the
other.
now,
he
did
the
same
thing
in
these
robbery
trials.
so
perhaps,
douglas
might
want
to
find
himself
in
this
situation
where
he
de
--
denies
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
meyes.
i'm
not
trying
to
prejudge
meyes'
guilt
but
maybe
his
testimony
is
just
like
it
was
in
the
murder
cases
that
--
that
he
could've
--
he
had
alibi
witnesses
for
example
in
the
murder
cases
on
the
date
that
the
robberies
were
supposed
to
be
committed.
judge
rhone
even
has
this
in
the
transcript
as
your
honors
have
seen.
so
therefore,
if
he
can
produce
an
alibi
witness
for
example
at
the
robbery
trial
and
meyes
cannot,
how
can
an
attorney
representing
both
of
these
people
be
arguing
and
advocate
for
one
of
them
when
he
can't
do
it
for
the
other
one?
the
case
is
cited
here
and
i
believe
it's
the
matson
case
and
also
the
robinson
case,
state
that
an
attorney
must
have
his
mind
free
and
cluttered
--
free
and
uncluttered,
excuse
me.
he
must
not
be
worried
about
being
embarrassed
when
he
argues
for
a
second
party.
and
if
he
can
be
embarrassed
in
his
argument,
he
cannot
effectively
represent
both
men.
now,
this
is
exactly
the
situation
we
have
here.
how
can
both
meyes
and
douglas
be
effectively
represented
by
the
same
man
when
in
a
--
in
a
proceeding
earlier
in
two
proceedings,
one
of
them
has
received
an
acquittal
for
heinous
crime
that
involved
as
a
motive
all
these
robberies
and
the
other
has
been
convicted?
so
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
is
conflict.
if
i
ever
seen
conflict
in
a
case.
now,
earlier,
chief
justice
warren,
you
inquired
to
mr.
marks
as
did
some
of
the
other
justices
about
the
lack
of
preparation
and
i
would
like
to
state
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
i
can
point
that
out
to
you.
page
36
would
be
one
instance.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
at
the
top
or
the
starting
at
the
top
of
the
page,
“i
do
not
see
why
counsel
cannot
bring
to
the
court's
attention
where
any
beliefs
a
conflict
will
occur",
mr.
atkins.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
oh,
no,
36,
your
honor,
in
the
transcripts
of
records.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
and
this
--
mr.
--
where
mr.
atkins
begins
to
speak
about
line
four.
first
off,
i
may
make
something
clear.
i'm
not
asking
for
dismissal.
i'm
asking
for
continuance.
past
history
proves
that
no
conflict
appears.
this
is
what
mr.
carr
said,
"what
has
happened
since
then?"
said
mr.
atkins.
“well,
something
has
happened
since
then
your
honor.
douglas
was
acquitted
and
bennie
meyes
was
convicted.
now,
i
can
defend
both
of
them
but
i
am
in
a
disadvantage
in
that
if
i
defend
both
of
them,
the
stigma
of
the
murder
conviction
as
to
bennie
meyes,
i
have
to
talk
out
of
one
side
of
my
mouth
as
to
bennie
meyes
and
out
of
the
other
side
of
my
mouth
is
to
mr.
douglas.”
and
the
court
says,
"i
don't
know
why."
well,
how
obvious
can
anything
be?
and
this
is
certainly
brought
up
in
the
record.
now,
mr.
atkins
goes
on
as
your
honors
can
see
that
he
feels
mr.
douglas,
he
should
have
an
attorney
who
would
represent
him
and
him
alone
who
can
make
the
best
use
of
the
fact
that
an
acquittal
was
earned
on
his
behalf
in
the
murder
trial.
that
is
a
conflict.
i
submit
that
that
this
a
conflict
present
in
this
case
which
should
be
obvious
to
anyone
that
two
lawyers
are
necessary.
then
again,
on
page
67,
at
the
top
of
the
page
in
the
transcript,
there
is
a
discussion
that
is
taking
place
in
the
impaneling
and
the
board
hearing
of
the
jury
that
concerns
--
again,
he
really
brings
up
this
question
of
conflict
because
you
can
see
that
there's
going
to
be
a
conflict
again
between
a
prior
conviction
that
meyes
is
(inaudible)
going
to
not
have
to
take
the
stand
and
sit
mute
and
douglas
might
like
to
get
up
and
defend
himself
and
you
know
state
that
he
have
nothing
to
do
because
he
doesn't
have
to
fear
being
impeached
by
having
a
conviction
of
a
prior
felony.
but
he
can't
--
but
they
want
to
see
an
attorney
going
to
argue
for
both
of
the
petitioners
at
the
end
of
the
trial.
why
did
one
get
up
and
testify?
why
did
the
other
one
sit
still
and
not
say
anything?
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
this
is
my
inference
from
--
from
the
apparent
problem
that
is
brought
right
up
in
the
transcript.
now,
i
--
i
think
i
can
point
out
to
the
court
numerous
other
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
67.
one
moment,
your
honor.
well,
the
court
says
the
only
problem
that
worried
me
in
all
juries
when
the
jurors
asked
whether
or
not
they
would
consider
the
testimony
of
this
one
or
that
one
any
differently.jury
has
not
seen
or
heard
any
testimony.
well,
mr.
atkins
talks
--
i
think
the
question
is
perfectly
proper
because
the
consideration
of
a
previous
conviction
by
the
defendant
shouldn't
no
way
influence
their
determination
weighing
the
evidence.
the
point
is
mr.
atkins
there
is
where
during
the
juror
on
previous
conviction
because
he
knows.
he
knows
he
has
to
bring
it
up
as
to
meyes
if
he
allows
meyes
to
get
up
and
take
the
stand.
but
he
doesn't
have
to
do
as
to
douglas.
now,
the
same
attorney
representing
both
men
here
asking
a
question
like
this,
about
--
would
the
fact
that
are
--
it
was
a
previous
conviction,
the
previous
felony
conviction
prevents
you
from
--
you
know
even
considering
that
are
giving
a
just
verdict
and
they,
of
course,
they
answered
that
it
wouldn't
but
either
fact
that
even
brings
it
up
because
he
knows
that
this
is
what
is
going
to
happen
as
soon
as
he
starts
conducting
the
trial.
this
stigma
which
is
clearly
pointed
out
to
the
court
because
it
is
a
colloquy
between
mr.
atkins
and
the
court
is
going
to
reverberate
against
mr.
douglas.
and
mr.
douglas
says,
"i
don't
want
to
have
any
of
that
stigma."
he
doesn't
want
to
have
a
lawyer
talking
about
a
man
who
has
a
felony
conviction
and
at
the
same
time
talking
about
a
man
who
has
a
clean
record,
who
has
an
acquittal
for
--
in
the
murder
case.
now,
i
say
that
mr.
atkins
can't
properly
and
with
full
heart
as
the
robinson
case
asked
him
to
do,
talk
for
both
of
these
men
at
the
same
time.
now,
that
i
--
i
submit
to
you
as
ample
evidence
of
a
conflict
between
these
petitioners.
now,
going
onto
the
questions
that
were
directed
as
to
the
preparation,
well,
i'm
just
wondering
your
honors
but
i
don't
put
these
in
the
form
of
a
question.
your
inquiries
were
directed
as
to
how
much
time
was
available
for
the
public
defender
to
prepare
his
case
and
some
39
or
40
days
i
think
was
available.
well,
are
the
defendants
to
be
charged
with
the
lack
of
preparation
by
the
public
defender?
what's
the
first
thing
this
public
defender
says
when
he's
called
for
trial?
he
says,
"we
are
not
ready.”
is
that
all
he
says?
judge
rhone
have
us
believe
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
i'm
reading
from
page
31
in
the
transcripts.
excuse
me
your
honors,
i
go
back
--
i
start
page,
earlier,
29.
the
first
words
of
mr.
atkins,
"we
are
not
ready
for
trial.”
now
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
that's
on
page
29
in
the
transcript
above
the
one,
two,
three,
four
sentence
down,
your
honor.
now,
judge
rhone
have
us
believe
that
all
the
public
defender
wasn't
prepared
for
was
the
fact
that
he
didn't
cross
index
the
earlier
transcripts.
your
honors,
i
submit
to
you,
this
is
an
untruth
because
mr.
--
mr.
atkins
has
consistently,
i'm
going
to
point
out
to
you
page-by-page
now,
stated
that
he
was
unqualifiedly
unprepared.
now,
i
refer
your
honors
to
the
following
statements
by
mr.
atkins.
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
not
cross
indexing
your
honors
and
before
i
point
that
out,
i
just
want
to
say
that
that
is
no
small
task.
there
were
12
weeks
of
murder
trials.
there
were
several
hundred
pages
of
transcripts.
so
that
--
that
was
a
considerable
job
that
not
had
done
prior
to
coming
into
court
that
morning.
now,
first,
he
says
that
he
is
not
prepared,
on
page
29,
and
he
goes
on
to
be
more
ex
--
explicit.
he
says
that
he
hasn't
had
a
time
to
make
a
complete
investigation.
that's
in
the
fifth
sentence
down,
the
next
sentence
down.
he
says,
"for
that
reason,
we
have
not
been
able
to
complete
the
investigation,
contact
these
people,
these
robbery
witnesses
and
interrogate
them,
asking
their
reasons
for
remembering
dates."
well,
he
has
stated,
"this
is
a
lot
different
than
not
cross
indexing
prior
transcripts",
is
it
not
your
honors?
when
a
man
says
“i've
not
investigated.
the
matson
case,
and
i
refer
you
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
page
12,
the
footnote,
matson
--
people
versus
matson
and
this
is
so
important
where
a
federal
due
process
requires
appointment
of
counsel,
the
state
court's
appointment
must
be
effective.
it
must
afford
counsel
time
and
opportunity
and
impose
upon
him
the
duty.
now,
here's
the
crux
of
this
case.
there
is
a
duty
on
this
public
defender
to
be
ready
for
trial.
are
we
going
to
charge
the
defendants,
meyes
and
douglas
with
the
fact
that
their
counsel
wasn't
ready
just
because
he
had
29
days
to
prepare?
your
honors,
these
two
men
are
sitting
up
on
the
county
jail.
they
can't
walk
into
the
courtroom
earlier
to
make
a
motion,
much
is
made
of
the
fact
that
they
made
a
delayed
motion
on
the
time
actually
set
for
trial.
i'll
point
out
to
the
justices
that
there
was
no
prior
continuance
of
this
case
at
all?
this
was
a
cumulative
impact
on
the
defendants.
they
realized
just
as
time
drew
near
for
trial
that
their
counsel
wasn't
getting
them
any
attention.
that
he
hadn't
come
up
to
see
them.
he
admitted
that
he
says
he
came
up
for
three
hours.
they
say
it
was
less
than
that.
three
hours,
your
honors,
are
not
enough
to
prepare
a
case
that
involves
almost
a
thousand
pages
of
earlier
transcript
plus
the
other
investigation.
so
here,
the
court
talks
about
the
matson
case
imposed
a
duty
upon
this
counsel
to
investigate
and
prepare
for
this
trial.
what
duty
is
the
court
imposed
upon
him?
now,
if
he
says
that
he
was
unprepared
and
later
qualified
to
say
that
i
could
go
ahead
and
try
this
case
but
i
haven't
done
certain
things,
he
said
much
more
than
that.
here's
what
he
said,
on
page
29.
now,
let's
turn
to
page
31.
i
refer
you
to
renewal
for
motion
for
continuance
and
denial
thereof.
that's
drop
down
to
the
sentences.
since
now,
in
talking
to
these
two
defendants,
there's
a
problem
arouse
only
yesterday
amongst
other
problems
when
i
discussed
with
them
the
final
--
talking
to
them
to
prepare
to
come
in
to
court
today.
he
speaks
there
about
the
fact
that
these
problems
just
arouse
the
day
before
the
trial
which
is
a
very
good
indication
of
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
prepared
to
go
to
trial.
now,
page
32,
now,
listen
to
this
statement.
i
never
heard
a
more
statement
that
contradicts
itself,
on
top
of
page
32,
“on
my
own
part
i
feel
that
i'm
prepared.
however,
i
have
not
been
able
to
state
in
the
transcripts
of
the
previous
trials
which
are
voluminous
and
through
the
press
of
all
the
other
businesses
that
our
office
handles,
i
have
been
handling
a
case
today
like
every
other
deputy.
i
have
not
been
able
to
give
this
the
time
that
i
think
i
should
devote
to
it
at
present.
so,
for
that
reason,
i,
myself,
feel
that
would
like
some
more
preparation.”
now,
you
can't
equivocate
your
statements
like
that.
you
can't
say
“i'm
prepared,
i'm
not
prepared”.
an
attorney
is
prepared
or
he
is
not
prepared.
and
it
--
again
i
say,
it
was
the
duty
of
the
court
to
--
to
see
if
this
man
was
ready
for
trial
before
he
sent
these
two
defendants
on
the
--
have
tried
the
case
alone
and
the
record
being
replete
with
objections
give
us
a
week
continuance,
give
us
more
continuance.
now,
let's
turn
to
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
it
might
make
a
difference
--
it
might
not,
your
honor.
i
say
to
your
honor
that
the
court,
if
the
defendants
are
standing
vicariously
objecting
to
the
fact
that
their
lawyer
is
unprepared
to
try
their
case
and
they
are
not
ready
to
go
to
trial
then
had
no
previous
continuances,
the
court
would
have
a
duty
to
give
them
some
kind
of
a
continuance
be
it
ever
so
short
to
remedy
this
problem.
but
we
must
take
all
the
circumstances
here.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
not
necessarily.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
all
the
circumstances
particularly
the
way
the
defendants
themselves
would
react
to
this
sort
of
a
situation.
i
think
most
defendants
unfortunately
sit
mute.
i
mean,
they
don't
--
they
don't
get
up
and
say,
“i
want
to
dismiss
my
attorney”,
because
after
all
they
give
that
attorney
money
and
they
go
along
with
them
and
now,
they're
too
embarrassed
to
get
up
and
--
and
they
feel
their
attorney
knows
what
he's
doing.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
in
these
circumstances
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
--
you're
asking
me
up
your
honor?
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
i
don't
think
that
can
receive
a
categorical
answer,
yes
or
no.
i
think
it
depends
on
all
the
circumstances.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
it
makes
a
great
difference
because
we're
talking
about
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
effective
appointment
of
counsel.
we're
talking
about
two
defendants
incarcerated
in
the
county
jail
with
no
opportunity
to
come
into
the
courtroom
and
to
raise
the
motion
and
say,
“i
want
to
change
my
counsel.”
we're
talking
about
a
cumulative
situation
here
when
you
take
all
the
facts
into
consideration
that
dawned
on
them
as
they
were
going
to
--
to
trial.
there
--
they
realized
the
last
moment,
the
last
two
or
three
days,
it
would
be
impossible
because
their
man
hadn't
come
up
to
talk
to
them
long
enough.
he
told
them,
“i
never
read
the
transcripts.”
i
see
your
point
your
honor
and
i
do
not
mean
to
deviate
from
giving
you
a
direct
answer
but
i
feel
that
it
would
depend
on
all
the
circumstances
and
we
must
take
these
two
defendants
and
the
circumstances,
we
find
them
in
the
county
jail
with
an
appointment
of
a
public
defender
who
unequivocally
states
that
he
is
not
prepared.
now,
i
--
i
turn
to
page
36
again.
i
just
want
to
point
in
the
transcript
at
the
bottom
of
the
--
the
page,
the
court
says,
“well,
this
matter
has
been
on
calendar
before
and
there
have
been
three
continuances
before,
three
motions
working
on
this
before.
i
cannot
hear
these
matters
piecemeal.”
there
has
been
no
motions
for
continuance
before.
this
is
a
misstatement
by
the
court.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
and
this
is
the
first
time
this
man
had
ever
asked
for
a
continuance.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
the
bottom
of
the
page
your
honor.
the
word
says,
“the
court”.
the
last
four
lines
from
the
bottom
of
page
36
of
the
tra
--
of
the
transcript.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
the
court
is
saying
that
this
matter
has
been
in
the
calendar
before.
there
has
been
three
continuances
before
and
there
has
never
been
one
continuance
before.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
it
certainly
is.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
there's
a
record
here
in
--
in
the
record,
your
honor,
of
--
of
all
the
motions
that
have
gone
up
before
the
court.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
on
page
9,
on
the
arraignment
and
the
plea
on
page
10,
sets
the
date
for
trial,
so
there's
been
no
continuances
whatsoever.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
even
if
counsel
didn't
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
the
court
has
erred
by
its
own
record
in
--
in
seeing
that
there
had
been
no
continuances
whatsoever
brought
before
this
court
before.
now,
your
honor,
i
--
i
might
say
this
to
you,
i
think
that
some
place
in
this
transcript,
he
does
call
to
the
judge
of
the
court.
i
just
like
saying
he
does
and
then
start
searching
the
record
and
taking
valuable
time.
but
i
think
that
he
brings
it
up
because
he
set
over
and
over
again.
they
we're
just
asking
for
one
continuance.
this
is
the
first
continuance
and
words
to
that
effect.
but
perhaps,
i
will
come
upon
that.
now,
i
direct
your
honors'
attention
to
page
38
and
39.
let's
take
page
38,
about
two
thirds
through
the
page.
mr.
atkins,
this
is
following
--
mr.
atkins
says,
“i
am
not
prepared
to
go
to
trial,
your
honor.”
well,
what
more
of
a
--
an
equivocal
statement
can
that
be?
“i
am
not
prepared
to
go
to
trial”,
page
39.
what
is
mr.
atkins
say,
following
words
in
the
middle
of
the
page
where
he
says,
“discussion
at
bench
between
the
court
and
the
counsel?”
i
express
the
feeling
to
the
court,
for
lines
down,
that
i,
myself,
wish
more
time
to
prepare
this
case.
he
has
taken
that
to
me
that
i'm
unprepared
and
the
manner
of
speaking,
i,
myself
would
like
to
have,
would
rather
be
a
good
deal
more
prepared
than
i
am.
well,
you
see
if
this
stays
again,
your
honor,
there's
a
lot
of
pressure
being
put
upon
this
public
defender.
his
clients
now
are
just
standing
up
practically
screaming
and
saying,
“we
don't
want
him.
he
hasn't
read
the
transcripts.
he's
unprepared.”
well,
upon
this
time,
any
men
is
going
to
defend
themselves
and
this
is
exactly
what
he's
attempting
to
do
at
this
time.
he
is
trying
to
say,
“well,
i'm
somewhat
prepared
and
i'm
not
prepared.”
but
he
unequivocally,
several
times
in
his
transcript,
states
he's
not
prepared.
page
43
is
probably
his
strongest
statement,
“i
have
certainly
gone
through
them
a
little
at
this
point”,
meaning
the
transcript.
this
is
about
halfway
down,
“but
not
sufficiently
in
my
own
mind”.
page
45,
this
is
perhaps
his
strongest
statement,
right
at
the
top
of
the
page,
mr.
atkins
starts
talking,
about
three
lines
down,
“it
is
my
opinion
that
i
do
not
and
have
not
had
enough
time
devoted
to
this
case
to
adequately
prepare
me
for
trial.”
now,
your
honors,
if
two
defendants
don't
have
a
right
at
that
stage
in
the
proceedings
to
stand
on
their
constitutional
right
as
annunciated
by
the
pal
case
and
a
hundreds
of
cases
since
that
time
to
have
effective
counsel
appointed,
prepared
counsel
appointed
and
say,
“well,
we
cannot
have
this
man
represent
us
because
he
states,
he
isn't
prepared
to
try
this
case."
i
don't
know
how
much
greater
they
could
protect
the
record
nor
how
much
more
their
constitutional
rights
should
be
enforced
in
that
statement.
now
--
excuse
me?
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn't
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
the
specific
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
he
just
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
justice
black,
he
was
unprepared
and
he
cited
the
reasons
that
he
had
not
read
nor
study
nor
investigated
the
transcripts
of
the
prior
murder
trials
as
to
the
portion
that
concern
themselves
with
every
witness
had
testified
at
this
trial.
then
he
doubtedly
didn't
read
them
and
didn't
have
in
my
mind
the
cross-examination
that
i
have
--
so
laborious
gone
through
for
12
weeks
but
he
did
not
make
an
investigation
as
to
the
alibis
that
were
brought
up
as
to
those
robberies
and
as
to
every
other
thing
that
concern
those
robberies.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
undoubtedly,
your
honor,
and
even
more
because
you
see
in
the
other
case,
we're
merely
preparing
for
--
you
know
this
is
a
motive
question
that
was
brought
up,
and
the
main
issue
was
the
murder
trial
itself,
so
undoubtedly,
we
would
have
put
greater
preparation
into
defending
the
robbery
case
when
this
would
become
the
main
issue.
but
there
was
so
much
material.
there
were
800
pages
of
cross-examination.
i
can
still
hear
myself
referring
to
the
jury.
i've
never
seen
a
collection
of
witnesses
like
this.
they
--
one
of
them
couldn't
see
15
feet,
didn't
have
their
glasses
on
it
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
robbery.
it
--
they're
talking
about
an
incident
that
happened
200
feet
from
her,
positively
refuse
to
identify
douglas.
there
are
so
many
things
that
were
brought
up
there
that
if
a
man
had
prepared
and
had
read
those
transcripts
and
it
gone
out
and
investigated,
your
honor,
ask
him
what
didn't
they
do?
they
didn't
investigate,
he
didn't
read,
he
didn't
talk
to
any
witnesses
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
--
he
didn't
have
any
witnesses
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
some
investigations
have
been
made.
there
were
no
witnesses
under
subpoena,
your
honor.
there
was
a
one
witness
under
subpoena.
there
was
no
investigation.
he
says
so
himself.
there
was
no
preparation.
there
was
no
reading.
he
had
been
in
trial
everyday.
he
wasn't
ready
for
trial.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
carr
had
a
great
number
of
witnesses.
that
is
true.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
your
honor,
let
me
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
--
let
me
back
track
slightly.
he
didn't
--
that
he
didn't
make
any
but
i
interpret
that
statement
that
after
he
says
we
have
not
been
able
to
complete,
he
says
what
he
didn't
do.
contact
these
people,
interrogate
them,
ask
them
their
possible
reasons
for
remembering
certain
days.
i
think
he's
saying
there
that
he
didn't
do
any
of
these
things.
it
isn't
that
he
didn't
do
anything
at
all,
of
course,
not
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
again,
i'll
say
to
your
honor
that
taking
all
of
the
public
defender
statements.
and
there
are
many
in
this
transcript.
there
are
so
many,
there
are
unequivocal
that
state
that
he
wasn't
prepared,
that
he
didn't
feel
ready
to
go
trial,
that
he
couldn't
do
his
best
for
these
two
boys
under
the
circumstances,
that
he
needed
more
time
to
read
and
study.
could
not
the
court
have
granted
him
one
week
continuance
on
his
first
motion
for
continuance?
even
douglas
stated
that
he
said,
“i
would
go
for
it
if
i
--
he
--
i
had
a
week.
i'm
prepared,
he
isn't.”
if
he
had
a
week,
he'll
be
gladly
to
have
the
public
defender
represent
him.
so
i
say
to
your
honor
that
when
you
take
this
record
as
a
whole,
it
is
a
most
complete
record
and
it
replete
so
many
times
stating
lack
of
preparation
with
continuous
objections
by
the
defendants.
you
know,
the
respondents
urged
the
court
to
--
to
think
that
they're
trying
to
--
stole
this
case.
well,
what
motive
would
they
have
for
that?
they
are
in
the
county
jail.
it
isn't
like
they're
buying
a
few
more
days
of
freedom.
douglas
wasn't
serving
anytime
at
all
except
he
--
after
he
was
acquitted
on
the
murder
case,
he
would
have
been
able
to
go
out
to
the
court,
the
streets
of
freeman.
mr.
carr
brings
up
something
about
being
him
on
probation
from
a
check
but
that's
not
true
because
the
court
at
the
end
of
murder
trial
said
that
he
already
done
his
time
while
being
in
custody
for
the
murder
trial
as
a
violation
of
probation.
so
he
was
perfectly
free.
so
there's
no
reason
why
douglas
want
to
continue
this
case
and
want
to
delay
it.
on
the
contrary,
they
want
it
heard.
they
just
wanted
their
counsel
to
be
prepared
for
their
case
and
give
their
full
benefit
of
their
advocacy.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
--
(voice
overlap)
--
good
criminal
lawyer.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
they
were,
your
honors.
there
were
on
the
stand
at
a
great
while
and
there
were
--
but
there
were
two
trials,
also.
so,
it
was
not
just
267
page
in
the
transcript,
it
was
500
because
there
were
two
trials
and
there
was
different
testimony
in
each
trial.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
i
might
say
the
second
trial
took
about
8
weeks,
i
think
your
honor.
the
first,
it
took
about
6,
somewhere
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
just
to
briefly
summarize,
this
is
of
course
a
case
for
reargument.
it's
a
case
where
two
admittedly
indigent
defendants
went
through
a
criminal
trial
which
involved
13
felony
counts,
all
of
a
rather
complicated
nature.
one
of
the
felony
counts
being,
an
assault
with
an
attempt
to
commit
murder
that
were
reasons
to
be
discussed,
counsel
was
dismissed
by
the
two
defendants
at
the
inception
of
the
trial.
both
defendants
sat
mute
through
the
entire
trial.
it
raises
questions
of
due
process
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
effective
appointment
of
counsel
and
also,
what
is
raised
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
as
a
matter
of
right
on
an
appeal
an
indigent
defendant
should
have
the
absolute
right
to
have
counsel
appointed.
now,
since
our
last
hearing,
there
has
been
a
supplemental
brief
filed
by
both
the
petitioners
and
respondents'
answer
to
that
supplemental
brief,
and
my
brother
goertzen
to
my
right
here
has
pointed
out
in
his
supplemental
brief,
has
made
an
offer
to
lodge
the
murder
trial
record
with
this
court.
your
honors
may
recall
there
were
two
murder
trials,
one
was
a
hung
jury.
then
there
was
a
second
murder
trial
in
which
the
defendant,
douglas
was
acquitted
and
meyes
was
convicted
of
second
degree
murder.
after
that,
there
was
an
indictment
of
both
defendants
as
to
robberies,
these
13
counts
of
robberies,
and
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
in
this
regard
that
these
13
robberies
that
were
testified
to
at
this
trial
--
at
this
appeal
that
we're
considering
here
were
extensively
discussed
in
the
earlier
two
murder
trials.
by
that,
i
mean,
that
the
same
witnesses
virtually,
the
entire
cast
of
witnesses
who
appeared
to
testify
against
the
defendants
in
this
matter
here
testified
at
both
murder
trials.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
it
was
a
murder
charge
of
the
killing
of
a
police
officer.
now,
i
will
come
to
my
brother
goertzen's
suggestion
to
lodge
that
transcript
with
the
court,
because
if
the
court
would
be
interested
to
look
at
that
transcript,
although
we
don't
wish
to
overburden
the
court
of
matters
outside
the
record,
in
a
way,
it's
inextricably
tied
up
into
this
case,
because
i
believe
that
that
record
will
indicate
to
this
court
the
following
information
that
really
hasn't
come
before
the
court.
the
judge
in
the
first
murder
case,
judge
roth
was
the
judge
who
tried
these
defendants
in
this
matter
here,
the
same
judge
who
refused
or
--
dismissed
counsel
after
defendants
indicated
that
they
didn't
want
counsel
to
represent
them.
the
same
judge
that
refused
to
recognize
the
conflict
of
interest
and
denied
all
of
the
defendants'
motions.
we'll
also
indicate
to
this
court
that
the
judge
who
tried
the
first
murder
trial,
the
same
judge
in
this
case,
disqualified
himself
to
hear
the
second
murder
trial.
that's
an
interesting
fact
because,
obviously,
he
felt
that
there
was
some
conflict
that
he
should
hear
this
matter
a
second
time,
so
by
the
time
he
came
to
these
robbery
trials,
he
felt
that
there
was
no
conflict
despite
a
motion
being
made
by
the
public
defender
atkins
that
they
should
be
disqualified
under
170.6,
which
is
our
statute
for
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
in
california,
we
don't
have
to
state
the
reason
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
he
just
filed
a
general
disqualification
that
he
had
heard
--
that
he
should
disqualify
himself
under
--
right.
now
it
would
also
reveal
--
you
see
there's
been
much
talk
of
whether
or
not
there
could
be
any
possible
conflict.
now,
i
say
to
the
court
that
i
happen
to
try
the
--
both
murder
trials.
i
represented
douglas
and
i
gained
an
acquittal
for
him.
and
having
some
personal
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
there
were
over
266
pages
of
cross-examination
on
the
second
trial
and
on
the
first
two,
of
all
these
witnesses,
i
can
state
to
this
court
not
because
of
the
meritorious
job
that
i
might
have
done
or
did
not
do,
but
they
were
thoroughly
impeached
these
witnesses
and
very
badly
discredited.
and
i
feel
quite
frankly
in
all
earnestness
that
this
cross-examination
of
these
witnesses
helped
gain
an
acquittal
for
douglas.
so
when
a
statement
is
made
by
the
judge
who
tried
the
first
case
and
knows
the
testimony
from
these
witnesses
and
the
prosecutor
who
was
the
same
prosecutor
on
both
murder
cases
that
there
was
no
conflict
that
both
defendants
were
positively
identified
by
all
these
witnesses
in
almost
every
respect,
that
just
is
not
the
truth
of
the
matter.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
they
were
very
much
discredited,
and
of
course,
in
this
particular
trial
when
those
13
--
when
those
witnesses
are
unopposed
and
there
is
no
one
there
to
cross-examine
them
in
any
regard,
of
course,
their
testimony
at
first
blush
may
seem
very
powerful
and
very
damaging,
but
i
can
assure
you
if
counsel
had
been
there
to
point
out
the
ways
that
that
very
same
testimony
had
been
impeached
prior
to
that
time,
there
might
have
been
a
different
result
in
this
case.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
no,
i
did
not,
your
honor.
much
to
my
regret,
i
was
out
of
the
country
at
the
time
and
that's
why
i've
been
here
twice
because
i
wish
i
had
represented
him,
but
i
might
point
out,
your
honor,
that
meyes
received
very
adequate
representation
by
public
defender
breckenridge,
and
i
might
say
this
to
your
honors
that
mr.
breckenridge
is
a
far
more
competent
attorney
than
i
am
and
had
a
vastly
more
experiences
as
a
trial
lawyer
and
i
think
that
he's
represented
douglas
and
i
represented
meyes,
the
result
would
have
been
the
same.
now
i
point
that
out
because
i
think
it's
very
important
in
this
regard
that
i
would
ask
my
brother
goertzen
who
he
would
rather
have
represented
when
we
talk
about
no
conflict
between
these
two.
here
is
the
man
on
one
hand
who
has
four
prior
felonies,
and
douglas
who
has
a
clean
record
has
no
felonies.
douglas
who
had
just
received
an
acquittal
for
murder,
meyes
who's
been
convicted
of
a
murder
and
these
two
were
thrown
into
a
trial
together
and
almost
naively
the
prosecutor
says
their
judicial
conflict
and
the
court
says,
“well
tell
me,
where
is
your
conflict?”
and
atkins
--
defender,
atkins
said,
“i
submit
to
this
court
that
it
is
a
conflict
that
any
lawyer
should
be
able
to
see.
obviously,
there's
a
conflict.”
now,
how
could
--
and
atkins
says,
“i
would
--
attorney
should
be
in
the
position
to
bring
out
the
best
phases
of
douglas'
case
as
opposed
to
meyes.”
well,
how
could
he
do
that?
it's
a
question
that
that
could
even
be
brought
up.
it
could
be
done
very
simply.
let's
take
officer
bitterolf
who
is
the
crime
testifying
officer
in
both
matters,
all
three
matters
in
these
robbery
cases.
in
other
words
bitterolf
testified
to
show
that
there
was
a
motive
to
resist
arrest
on
the
part
of
the
defendants
that
they
admitted
these
robberies
after
they
had
been
shot.
this
was
around
the
time
of
the
murder,
of
course,
but
they
brought
this
testimony
back
into
the
robbery
trial.
now
you
could
say
that
sergeant
bitterrolf,
when
he
took
the
stand,
“sergeant
bitterolf,
are
you
biased
in
this
case?”
i'm
talking
about
the
present
case,
the
robbery
case
and
he
says,
“no,
i'm
not
biased.”
well,
the
fact
that
a
brother
officer
had
been
killed
in
a
case
where
douglas
had
been
acquitted,
it
could
be
a
perfectly
proper
question,
i
submit
to
the
court,
to
show
whether
or
not,
there
was
bias.
your
honors,
there
isn't
any
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
whole
proceeding
is
a
result
of
the
bias
by
the
los
angeles
police
department.
this
is
a
tragic
event,
the
death
of
a
brother
officer,
but
here
they
have
two
trials
where
finally
douglas
is
acquitted.
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
there
was
a
hung
jury.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
there
was
a
hung
jury.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
as
to
both
as
to
both.
and
then
on
the
second
trial,
of
course,
you
know
the
result,
but
let
me
say
this
to
you.
meyes
is
found
to
be
a
habitual
criminal.
that
means
he's
--
he
can't
give
a
man
more
than
life.
what
was
the
necessity
of
bringing
meyes
back
to
the
robbery
trial?
he's
a
habitual
criminal.
he's
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
after
the
second
murder
trial,
the
result
is
the
same.
he'll
be
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life
unless
the
matter
is
ultimately
reversed.
so
why
do
you
bring
him
in
a
robbery
trial?
it's
so
obvious
because
they
want
to
put
him
back
together
with
douglas.
they
want
the
tape
of
bennie
meyes
to
rub
off
under
douglas.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
there
was
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
i
can
tell
you
what
has
happened.
what
has
happened
is
that
the
conviction
has
been
sustained
and
i
think
there
is
further
appeal.
now,
they
asked
him
was
there
any
conflict?
there's
no
conflict
between
meyes
and
douglas.
your
honors,
i'll
just
read
to
you
one
sentence
from
california
reporter,
18
california
reporter,
page
326.
this
is
the
case
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
just
asked
me
about.
and
this
is
to
show
the
continual
conflict
between
meyes
and
douglas
through
their
entire
proceedings.
commencing
at
the
top
of
page
326
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
this
is
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
pardon
me,
the
district
court
of
appeals,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
the
police
officers
brought
the
two
defendants
together
in
their
wheelchairs
in
the
hospital,
and
at
that
time,
officer
filbert
asked
defendant
douglas,
if
it
was
not
true
that
in
a
previous
statement,
he,
douglas
have
told
the
officers
that
he
was
lying
on
the
floor
in
the
front
bedroom
beside
the
bed,
that
there
was
a
gun
fired
in
the
room,
that
he
had
observed
meyes
shoot
at
the
officer
and
the
officer
shoot
at
meyes
in
exchange
of
gun
fire.
meyes
then
turned
to
douglas
in
his
wheelchair
and
said
to
him,
“are
you
going
to
let
me
go
like
that?”
douglas
then
stated
to
meyes,
you
are
going
to
fry
bennie
and
you
are
not
going
to
take
me
with
you.
tell
them
the
truth.
tell
them
you
pulled
the
trigger.
meyes
then
stated,
who
went
back
to
get
the
gun.
douglas
stated
to
meyes,
“if
i
have
done
it,
i
would
tell
the
truth.
tell
them
bennie
the
truth.
tell
them
you
pulled
it.
meyes
then
made
no
further
reply.
now,
i
just
bring
this
up
to
show
you
what
a
conflict
there
have
always
been
between
meyes
and
douglas.
indeed,
your
honors,
when
we
were
granted
the
honor
and
privilege
of
coming
before
this
court,
i
even
felt
the
necessity
to
have
co-counsel,
mr.
marks,
because
i
don't
even
think
in
advocating
an
appeal
that
--
you
see
i'm
talking
out
of
the
one
side
of
my
mouth
as
to
douglas
and
the
other
side
is
to
meyes.
i
don't
want
to
hurt
meyes,
but
i
was
so
much
able
to
present
a
better
case
in
a
murder
case
because
i
represented
one
man
only.
and
i
must
say
to
your
honors
that
i'm
only
sorry,
i
did
not
bring
it
with
me
but
i
will
gladly
lodge
it
with
an
exhibit
for
this
court.
i
had
my
final
argument
in
the
murder
--
second
murder
trial
--
pardon
me,
the
first
murder
trial
--
well,
the
second
murder
trial.
i
had
that
transcribed.
now,
i
can
still
clearly
recall
and
i
will
lodge
it
with
this
court
in
case
they
want
to
see
it,
i
can
recall
how
i
would
gather
to
argue,
i
had
to
compare
meyes
and
douglas
in
order
to
show
how
much
cleaner,
so
to
speak,
douglas
was,
that
he
had
no
prior
record
and
that
he
didn't
have
the
parole
officer
after
him
and
he
did
not
have
all
these
problems.
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
the
case
from
which
i
just
read.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
it
--
well
it
is
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
let
me
say
this
to
your
honor
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
i
will.
it
is
cal
--
18
california
reporter,
page
326.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
since
it
was
referred
in
the
respondents'
supplemental
brief,
that's
the
reason
i'm
commenting
on
it
now.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
burglaries
and
robberies
involving,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
very
same
witnesses
who
testified
in
two
earlier
murder
trials,
and
i
bring
up
these
other
trials
to
show
that
there
was
a
necessity
then
to
have
separate
counsel.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
it
would
bear
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
it
would
bear
on
this
case
because
you
recall
that
public
defender
atkins
stated
to
the
court
when
asked
the
very
same
question
that
you're
now
asking
me,
what
douglas
should
have
a
counsel,
he
should
be
able
to
make
the
most
of
the
fact
that
he
was
acquitted
in
these
previous
trials
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
you
would
get
it
in,
in
the
manner
--
the
one
of
the
ways
this
manner
i
just
described.
let
me
say
that
prosecutor
carr
got
it
in,
in
this
very
trial
by
referring
to
the
killing
of
a
police
officer
“and
they
killed
the
police
officer”.
now
he
allegedly
got
it
in
just
to
try
to
show
motive
on
the
part
of
resisting
arrest
that
they
are
more
likely
to
have
committed
the
burglaries.
well,
you
could
get
it
in
by
asking
sergeant
bitterolf
when
you
go
to
cross-examine
him
whether
or
not
he's
biased
for
one
thing,
because
of
the
fact
that
douglas
was
acquitted
of
killing
a
brother
police
officer.
this
would
be
a
perfectly
proper
question.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
it
would,
because
it's
a
bias
question.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
proper
to
show
bias
on
the
part
of
anyone
testifying.
and
i
think
--
i
represent
to
the
court
with
all
the
earnestness
i
can
muster
that
the
police
officers
were
most
bitter
at
the
death
of
a
brother
officer.
and
this
was
shown
in
the
demeanor
of
bitterolf
throughout
both
trials
and
i
believe
that
i
have
made
a
point
to
the
jury
by
showing
that
there
was
a
--
they
were
trying
to
get
both
of
these
fellows.
now
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
of
course,
yes
it
is.
that's
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
exactly,
mr.
justice
white.
that
is
the
point
i'm
making.
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes
sir.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
i
will.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
very
briefly?
this
is
how
they
came
in.
they
offered
these
robberies
to
show
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
alright.
the
police
officers
came
to
douglas'
apartment.
they
were
investigating
robberies,
alleged
robberies.
they
came
without
a
search
warrant.
they
came
into
the
premises.
there
were
some
people
whom
they
asked,
“where
is
bill
douglas?”
and
one
of
the
parties
said,
“he's
not
at
home.”
in
fact,
douglas
and
meyes
were
in
the
back
bedroom.
officer
nash
went
down
the
hall
opening
doors
and
came
into
this
bedroom,
in
this
darkened
bedroom,
there
was
gun
fire.
douglas
was
almost
mortally
wounded.
the
officer
died
and
meyes
was
wounded
and
jumped
out
the
window
and
escaped.
now,
they
brought
in
the
--
to
show
that
the
reason
they
were
resisting
the
arrest
is
because
they
were
--
had
committed
all
these
robberies.
this
is
the
point
there.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
have
done
that
and
i
realize
there's
sort
of
a
complicated
intertwined
set
of
three
matters
and
it
certainly
would
be
a
special
circumstance
under
betts
versus
brady,
i
think.
but
of
course
california
has
a
different
--
we
have
appellate
defender
system
so
we're
not
really
concerned
with
that
particular
portion.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
i
misinformed
you
and
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
you.
it's
not
the
felony
murder
rule
per
se.
it
was
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
it
was
a
charge
of
premeditated
murder.
yes.
now
lying
in
wait
killing
is
what
they
charged
that
they
were
lying
back
in
the
bedroom
waiting
for
police
officers
to
come
in.
of
course,
the
jury
rejected
as
to
both
defendants
that
--
that
it
has
found
a
second
degree
as
to
meyes
and
they
found
an
acquittal
as
to
douglas.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
they
should
have
had
separate
counsel.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
that
is
correct.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
do
agree
with
you
that
on,
of
course,
either
basis,
i
feel
that
the
california
appellate
review
or
the
appellate
situation
wherein
they
have
the
right
to
review
the
transcript
and
decide
whether
or
not
defendant
should
have
counsel,
i
believe
that
is
an
error
of
course
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
they
should
have
had
counsel.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
absolutely.
they
went
through
a
trial
without
any
representation
at
all.
so
i
believe
that
have
they
had
counsel,
they
could
have
certainly
made
a
record
and
there
would
have
been
something
to
go
by
except
a
one-sided
situation
as
we
now
have.
now,
turning
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
no,
there
is
not
a
guarantee
to
that.
but
of
course,
this
is
a
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
quite
possibly.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
i
think
it's
possible.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
now,
i
would
point
this
out
to
the
court.
now
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
an
effective
point
--
appointment
of
counsel,
this
brings
us
into
the
arguably
rather
thoroughly
the
last
time
but
i
would
only
point
out
there
that
they're
just
--
i
don't
see
how
there
could
be
any
question
that
this
was
ineffective
appointment
of
counsel.
much
has
been
stated
about
the
public
defender
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
that's
just
a
point
of
getting
to,
mr.
justice
white.
of
course,
the
big
point
here,
of
course,
i
think
there's
three
big
points
but
certainly
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
yes,
i
do.
i
do
agree
with
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
i
think
it
goes
to
--
it
could
go
to
either
counsel.
in
other
words,
douglas
dismissed
first,
so
therefore,
meyes
could
have
had
mr.
atkins
represent
him.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
except
for
another
reason.
now
--
and
that
is
just
what
we're
getting
to.
was
mr.
atkins
prepared?
now,
here
is
counsel
appointed
by
this
--
by
the
state.
this
is
not
a
free
choice
of
counsel.
these
two
men
are
in
jail.
they're
appointed
counsel.
on
the
day
of
the
trial,
it's
so
clearly
indicated
to
them
that
mr.
atkins
is
not
prepared.
as
i
pointed
out
to
the
court
last
time,
on
13
--

this
is
the
transcript,
31,
32,
36,
38,
39,
43,
45,
and
76.
mr.
atkins
stated
to
the
court,
“i
am
not
prepared.”
now
under,
i
think
pressure,
one
or
two
other
times,
he
stated
that
he
thought
he
could
go
through
and
do
a
good
job
that
for
his
own
part,
he
thought
he
might
be
prepared.
but
i
ask
this
honorable
court,
at
what
point
does
the
client
lose
the
confidence
in
his
attorney.
if
my
attorney
stands
up
and
says,
“i
am
not
prepared
to
go
to
trial,
can
there
be
anything
equivocal
about
that?”
it's
a
statement
that
he's
not
prepared.
and
mr.
atkins
came
into
that
courtroom
that
morning
and
he
started
out
by
stating
that
he
was
not
prepared,
he's
been
trying
a
case
a
day
like
all
the
other
deputies.
he
wasn't
prepared
to
go
to
trial.
there
is
nothing
equivocal
about
that.
he
held
to
that
position
until
considerable
palaver
between
the
prosecutor,
the
judge
and
finally
some
place
in
the
middle
there,
he
sort
of
backtrack
his
ground
a
little
bit,
but
he
ultimately
stated
he
was
not
prepared.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
he
was
appointed
six
weeks
prior
to
the
trial.
now,
i'd
like
to
correct
one
statement
that
my
brother
goertzen
has
made.
he
said
the
public
defenders
office
had
this
case
for
10
months.
well,
they
didn't
have
this
case
for
10
months.
for
10
months,
the
vast
public
defender
system
have
well
over
100
attorneys
was
in
some
way
connected
with
the
two
defendants.
this
is
not
a
small
law
firm
where
each
attorney
has
intimate
knowledge
in
the
other
attorneys'
cases.
the
public
defender
system
is,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
know,
is
a
system
where
they
appoint
two
or
three
defenders
to
each
court
room,
they
send
them
out
on
the
circuit
so
to
speak
to
various
branch
courts
while
the
very
fact
that
they
had
three
different
public
defenders
for
the
arraignment,
for
the
preliminary
hearing
and
for
the
trial
itself
indicates
that
there
was
a
complete
total
lack
of
communication
among
the
public
defender's
office
as
to
what
these
cases
were
all
about.
tell
me.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
no,
he
does
not.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
that
is
correct.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
i
think
they
have
close
to
a
hundred
and
i
might
say
that
whoever
has
happened
to
be
the
public
defender
in
that
courtroom
is
one
who
receives
the
appointment.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
no,
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
that
way
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
logical
thing
to
have
done
in
this
case
were
to
have
been
to
assign
mr.
breckenridge
who
have
thorough
knowledge
of
all
these
witnesses'
testimonies
and
to
prior
murder
trials
who
did
an
excellent
job
for
mr.
meyes
and
it
would
have
been
more
logical
to
have
allowed
him
to
represent
these
petitioners
at
that
trial.
perhaps,
it
would
not,
well
i
say,
he,
representing
one
of
them,
but
at
least
he
would
have
had
enough
knowledge
having
to
examine
all
these
witnesses
on
prior
occasions.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
i
think
they
could
have
been
prepared
for
that
trial.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
your
honor
posed
the
same
question
to
me
last
time.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
and
my
answer
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
very
true,
and
i
would
answer
it
this
way.
this
is
a
different
situation
in
private
counsel.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
because
they've
been
appointed
by
the
state
and
they're
not
counsel
of
free
choice.
in
other
words,
if
a
man
has
nothing
to
say
about
the
appointment
at
his
attorney,
if
i
have
chosen
attorney
who
came
into
court
and
said,
i'm
not
prepared,
i
might
be
bound
by
that,
because
i
will
have
waived
the
problems
that
come
up
so
to
speak.
i
have
chosen
the
attorney
and
i
am
bound
by
what
i've
done,
but
this
is
not
a
voluntary
act
on
the
part
of
either
meyes
or
douglas.
they
did
not
choose
this
attorney.
they
had
this
attorney
assigned
to
them.
this
attorney
admitted
at
the
most
that
he
spent
three
hours
with
these
two
men.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
the
only
difference
--
he
might
have
the
same
status
because
he's
going
to
conduct
the
case
in
the
same
manner,
but
he
might
have
a
different
status
when
we
retrospectively
look
back
and
we
see
what
has
happened
and
we're
trying
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
bound
by
his
appointment.
this
is
an
appointment
that,
as
i
say,
has
been
put
upon
them.
this
is
not
of
their
own
choosing.
they're
locked
up
in
the
jail.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
they
certainly
did
and
they
asked
repeatedly.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
the
only
difference
is
that
the
man
stands
in
and
says
i
do
--
i'm
indigent
and
i
cannot
get
an
attorney.
and
the
court
says,
“we
will
appoint
a
public
defender
for
you”,
because
that's
exactly
the
circumstance
to
which
a
public
defender
is
appointed
to
represent
a
man.
so
it's
either
a
case
of
having
the
representation
over
not
having
representation.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
no,
i
don't
say
that
they
should
apply
a
different
rule,
but
i
do
say
that
when
a
public
defender
comes
into
a
courtroom,
and
states
in
an
unequivocal
language
to
a
court
that
he
is
not
prepared
to
properly
represent
a
defendant,
then
it
is
the
duty
of
the
court
to
grant
a
short
continuance
perhaps
a
week
or
two,
and
allow
that
man
to
be
properly
represented.
in
the
face
of
a
man
saying
13
times,
“i'm
not
prepared”
that
means
exactly
what
it
says
and
i
think
there
is
no
longer
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
judge.
it
is
the
duty
upon
the
judge.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
well,
there
would
be
a
limit
to
everything,
but
this
has
never
happened
before
in
this
case.
there
was
no
motion
for
any
continuance
in
this
case.
at
any
time,
prior
to
this
day,
and
that
was
what
was
wrongfully
cited
to
the
court
also.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
it
is
--
your
honor,
i
have
to
answer
by
saying
it
is
really
a
question
of
fact.
i
think
that
there
comes
a
time
when
a
judge
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
right.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
the
court
could
have
compelled
them
to
proceed,
but
i
believe
that
under
these
circumstances,
it
would
have
been
an
abusive
discretion
even
with
a
paid
counsel.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
with
the
one
exception
that
in
the
case
of
a
public
defender,
it
is
a
court
state
appointed
counsel,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
free
choice
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
and
i
think
that
in
certain
circumstances,
the
defendant
would
be
less
bound
because
he
has
counsel
appointed
for
him
than
if
he
had
chosen
his
own
counsel.
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
your
honor,
i'm
not
--
i
think
i've
answered
your
question
and
i
note
your
statement.
at
this
time,
i
have
--
mr.
marks
and
i
were
going
to
divide
the
argument
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
and
i
would
like
to
give
him
--
mr.
marvin
m.
mitchelson
--
an
opportunity
to
perhaps
continue.
