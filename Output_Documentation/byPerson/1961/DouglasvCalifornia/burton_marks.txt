mr.
burton
marks
thank
you,
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
this
honorable
court.
this
case
involves
a
dual
question
of
the
denial
of
effective
--
of
consistence
of
counsel
to
two
indigent
defendants
at
trial
and
at
the
appellate
level,
and
as
our
contention
that
the
petitioners
were
denied
assistance
of
counsel
and
thus
due
process
of
law
and
equal
protections
of
the
law
at
both
stages.
now,
there
are
two
different
problems
arising.
and
as
far
as
i'm
concern,
only
one
problem
as
to
each
defendant
as
were
arise.
i
think
the
ultimate
question
which
is
going
to
be
involved
is
whether
or
not
appellate
justices
are
lawyers.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
in
the
sense
that
i
might
define
lawyer
would
be
no.
to
go
back
to
the
original
premises
that
at
the
trial,
there
was
a
very
--
and
i'm
just
going
to
go
through
that
situation
very
briefly.
an
attorney
who
is
appointed
for
both
the
defendants
stood
up
and
announced
to
the
court
that
number
one,
he
was
not
prepared
to
go
to
trial.
he
had
interviewed
the
defendants
twice.
i
believe
these
were
13
felony
accounts
charged
against
the
defendant.
and
secondly,
he
declared
that
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest,
i
believe
the
--
mr.
mitchelson's
explanation
of
why
there
was
a
conflict
of
intere
--
interest
at
a
later
date,
well,
he
illuminated
to
the
court.
however,
i
think
there's
no
argument
in
the
court
that
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
of
amend
--
amendments
of
the
constitution
as
they
include
the
sixth
amendments
define
what
effective
assistance
of
counsel
means.
one
is
that
you
must
be,
as
a
counsel,
prepared
to
defend
your
client.
and
i
think
that
was
enunciated
in
our
california
courts,
people
versus
madison,
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
and
second
is
that
you
are
--
to
be
effective
counsel,
you
must
be
able
to
devote
your
entire
zeal,
energy
and
devotion
to
the
cause
of
a
single
client
and
if
there
--
if
you
cannot
do
that
then
you
cannot
give
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
now
--
mr.
burton
marks
my
understanding
is
that
he
had
approximately
45
days.
it
was
went
from
the
18th
of
one
month
to
the
30th
of
the
next,
if
i'm
correct
about
the
arraignment.
mr.
burton
marks
i
would
see
that
it
isn't
--
not
an
abnormally
short
time.
however,
it
is
not
a
very
long
time
considering
what
the
amount
of
cases
at
the
public
defender's
office
has
and
i
--
i
am
not
a
public
defender
but
i
have
--
i
have
pretty
close
connection,
association
with
their
office.
i
do
know
that
they
are
constantly
in
court
each
and
everyday.
they
do
have
at
least
one
case
a
day
if
not
at
trial
a
day.
after
they
are
finished
with
their
trials,
they
go
to
the
county
jail
and
interview
their
clients
for
the
next
day.
that's
about
the
best
they
can
do.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
i
don't
know
whether
the
question
of
--
whether
to
question
of
having
ample
time
to
prepare
or
the
statement
that
he
is
not
prepared.
now,
if
the
attorney
is
not
prepared
and
has
a
good
and
valid
excuse
then
i
think
a
reason
for
not
being
able
to
be
prepared
and
that
is
an
extraordinary
case
load
then
i
think
that
it
would
be
an
abusive
discretion
for
the
court
to
say
that
he
was
prepared.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
as
i
say
that
each
situation
is
different
but
with
the
public
defendant
--
mr.
burton
marks
yes.
mr.
burton
marks
i
would
say
it
was.
but
i
--
let
say
it
was
--
is
an
--
of
discretion
that
is
--
wouldn't
be
very
easily
abused.
mr.
burton
marks
very
definitely.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
i
think
the
evidence
is
there's
no
conflict.
mr.
atkins,
who
was
the
public
defender,
did
a
very
extraordinary
thing
as
far
as
this
counsel
is
concern
in
defending
or
representing
his
client's
statement.
the
first
statement
he
made
to
the
court
was
i'm
not
prepared.
i've
seen
them
twice
and
there
are
certain
defenses
which
we
have
not
been
able
to
develop
certain
witnesses
which
we
have
not
yet
been
able
to
investigate.
and
he
also
stated
there's
a
conflict
of
interest.
now,
this
is
at
the
outset
--
mr.
burton
marks
--
but
he
didn't
back
off.
mr.
burton
marks
correct.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
his
only
statement
that
i
--
that
he
has
had
a
case
today,
that
he
saw
the
defendants
twice.
mr.
burton
marks
now,
two
times
on
an
interview
to
see
two
clients
who
were
charged
and
with
13
felony
counts
which
involved
eyewitness
identification
and
possible
alibis
to
meet.
it's
not
seemed
to
be
adequate
amount
of
preparation
for
a
case
regardless
of
whether
or
not
there
were
transcripts
available
of
prior
trials
where
the
prior
evidence
was
introduced.this
--
mr.
burton
marks
this
is
los
angeles
county.
mr.
burton
marks
they
have
--
i
think
about
60
public
defenders.
mr.
burton
marks
approximately.
and
i
think
that
the
average
number
of
cases
that
a
public
defender
handles
everyday
is,
for
each
deputy,
is
about
three
or
four,
perhaps
more
depending
on
whether
they're
in
a
calendar
court
or
in
a
trial
court.
but
they
obviously
have
to
be
expeditious
in
trying
to
dispose
of
cases
the
best
way
they
can
when
in
their
opinion,
they
have
a
guilty
situation
and
you're
trying
to
work
a
deal
just
like
any
private
attorney
would
be
to
get
a
lesser
offense
or
--
mr.
burton
marks
they're
above
equal.
i
think
there
are
few
less
public
defenders
than
there
are
prosecutors.
and
of
course,
the
public
defenders
have
a
multitude
of
jobs
as
to
the
prosecutors
but
the
public
defenders
have
a
few
more.
they
have
--
in
civil
cases,
they
may
retain
and
defend
an
interest
--
defendant
where
he's
being
sued
and
he
doesn't
have
any
money
or
where
--
where
he
needs
to
sue
somebody
to
get
money
and
he
makes
less
than
$100
a
month.
i
think
that's
part
of
the
requisites.
but
in
any
case,
the
public
defender
also
appears
in
arraign
--
arraignment
mis
--
misdemeanor
--
i'm
sorry,
the
municipal
court
where
the
preliminary
hearings
are
held.
and
it
takes
some
of
their
trial
time
away
from
the
various
deputies.
in
any
case,
whether
or
not
--
in
my
opinion,
i
think
it
is
a
bad
record
for
the
fact
that
mr.
atkins
backed
off.
i
think
it
was
a
natural
human
thing
to
do
because
he
stated
that
he
wasn't
prepared
and
then
the
defendants
jumped
on
him,
stating
they
didn't
want
counsel
who
was
not
prepared,
which
i
think
they
would
have
the
right
to
say.
and
thereupon,
he
backed
down
and
came
around
the
other
way
and
said,
“i
am
prepared
but
i'm
not.”
in
other
words,
i
could
go
to
trial
and
be
prepared
as
i
go
to
trial.
and
i
don't
--
that
wasn't
satisfactory
explanation
to
me.
i
don't
think
it
was
satisfactory
to
the
defendants
as
seen
from
the
record
because
this
is
--
was
one
of
their
constant
arguments
that
they
were
not
prepared.
and
of
course,
there
was
the
argument
by
the
prosecutor,
mr.
carr
that
time
that
--
well,
they've
been
through
two
trials
already,
the
defendants,
not
the
attorney.
and
this
is
the
third
time
around
with
the
same
witnesses
and
the
same
cases,
so
obviously
they
must
be
prepared.
but
this
isn't
so
obvious
because
--
and
i
wasn't
going
to
discuss
it
but
this
--
the
first
two
trials
were
murder
case,
where
both
defendants
were
tried
on
a
charge
of
murder.
and
these
13
robberies
or
good
number
of
them
were
very
subsidiary
to
the
issue
of
murder.
they
were
introduced
for
the
sole
purpose
of
showing
motive,
lying
in
wait
so
that
they
could
produce
a
first-degree
murder
charge
against
the
defendants.
now,
if
you're
going
to
defend
the
murder,
you
can't
go
in
and
also
try
it
and
produce
all
your
alibi
witnesses
or
whatever
you
might
have
to
defend
13
other
miscellaneous
felony
charges
which
are
throwing
in
for
just
one
specific
point.
mr.
burton
marks
no.
mr.
burton
marks
no.
mr.
burton
marks
there
was
one
unsuccessful
hung
jury.
the
second
one
was
successful
as
to
meyes
and
not
as
to
douglas.
mr.
burton
marks
meyes
got
second-degree,
right.
mr.
burton
marks
right.
mr.
burton
marks
right.
mr.
burton
marks
the
assaults
were
offenses
of
--
the
three
assaults
or
the
two
assaults
with
an
attempt
to
commit
murder,
as
my
understanding,
are
offenses
which
--
mr.
burton
marks
non-capital.
however,
they
were
associated
with
the
--
couple
of
the
robberies,
two
or
three
of
the
robberies,
but
there
were
a
period
of,
i
think,
eight
or
nine
robberies
which
were
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
burton
marks
about
four
or
five
months,
six
months
prior
to
the
murder.
mr.
burton
marks
four
months
prior
to
the
murder
which
is
--
another
subsidiary
point
is
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
reading
of
the
testimony,
the
assault
to
commit
murder
is
a
charge
with
--
which
i
believe
they
threw
in
it.
to
me,
there
would
be
nothing
here
more
serious
than
assault
with
a
dangerous
weapon
or
deadly
weapon
because
i
believe
it
was
a
hitting,
no
--
no
firing
of
any
gun,
i
think,
at
the
victims.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
the
procedure,
and
i
could
check
the
record,
they
--
the
defendants
were
arraigned
on
august
18th,
1959.
and
on
the
date
of
arraignment,
ordinary
procedure
is
to
continue
the
matter
for
plea
for
about
three
days
for
the
public
defenders
so
they
can
read
the
transcript.
mr.
burton
marks
yes.
mr.
burton
marks
not
this
particular
public
defender
but
the
public
defender
of
the
county
was
appointed
and
his
deputy
was
there
in
the
court
and
the
public
defender
was
appoi
--
appointed.
then
the
case
was
continued
over
for
plea,
i
believe,
for
--
to
august
21st,
three
days
and
at
that
time,
it
was
set
for
trial
on
september
30th.
mr.
burton
marks
that
would
be
39
days.
mr.
burton
marks
39
days.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
as
i
see,
it
is
the
case
load
of
the
public
defender.
each
individual
deputy
is
assigned
to
a
court
and
they
--
ordinarily,
there
are
two
deputies
to
each
court.
now,
the
number
of
cases
assigned
to
that
particular
court
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
number
of
public
defenders
and
there's
just
the
number
of
courts
that
are
available
so
--
because
each
defendant
must
be
brought
to
trial
within
60
days
unless
he
waives
time
for
trial.
so
the
--
in
the
calendar
court,
the
court
assigns
each
a
trial
date
into
a
particular
court
on
a
particular
date.
now,
the
public
defender
who
is
in
that
trial
court
is
the
trial
deputy
who
picks
up
the
case.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
i
would
say
from
the
record,
and
this
is
just
on
my
own
personal
experience,
that
mr.
atkins
may
have
looked
at
the
transcript
of
the
trial
of
the
preliminary
hearing
and
maybe
the
previous
transcripts,
something
like
five
days
before
the
trial
because
he
had
each
and
every
date
other
cases
which
were
set
in
the
same
department
which
he
not
necessarily
would
have
to
devote
his
attention
to
of
those.
mr.
burton
marks
this,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
burton
marks
i
also
don't
know
mr.
atkins'
personal
background.
i
do
not
believe
he
had
been
in
too
long.
he's
now
on
private
practice.
mr.
burton
marks
and
i
--
mr.
burton
marks
that
is
correct.
mr.
burton
marks
i've
had
that
experience
myself
to
go
and
try
a
case
on
the
day
be
--
before
i've
never
seen
the
--
the
trial
and
there
is
no
question
that
it
can
be
done
although
it's
not
good
practice.
in
some
cases,
it
must
be.
mr.
burton
marks
with
very
busy
lawyers,
i'm
sorry
to
say
this,
a
constant
practice
and
i
know
some
of
the
attorneys
in
los
angeles
who
do
practice
in
wait.
they
can't
help
it.
it's
just
one
of
those
things
that
must
be
done
because
they
have
no
way
that
it's
impossible
to
prepare
for
one
trial
interrogation
of
the
rights
of
another
clients,
so
you
have
to
--
what
you
do
is
allot
your
time
and
do
the
best
you
can
for
them
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
burton
marks
what
was
peculiar
about
this
case
was
the
--
as
i
understand
from
mr.
mitchelson
was
the
fact
that
the
13
robbery
counts
which
were
alleged
against
the
defendants
were
counts
which
involved
witnesses
of
not
the
greatest
repute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
robberies
were
supposed
to
have
been
--
of
crap
games.
in
other
words,
the
--
if
the
defendants
did
do
these
robberies
which
--
at
this
point,
they
are
judged
guilty
of
them,
they
were
gamblers
who
playing
craps
and
they
--
they
would
come
in
and
take
the
crap
players
moneys
away.
and
then
these
people
were
found
out
by
the
police
and
came
in
and
testify
then
some
of
their
testimony
was
not
too
reputable.
and
as
i
understand
from
mr.
michelson,
a
great
deal
of
cross-examination
was
involved
in
these
witnesses
to
discredit
them
and
impeach
them.
and
it
seems
to
be
supported
by
the
fact
that
the
prosecution's
theory
of
murder
by
lying
in
wait
because
of
these
enormous
number
of
prior
robberies
and
the
defendants
knew
they
were
going
to
be
apprehended
and
therefore,
they
were
lying
in
wait
to
kill
the
police
officer
didn't
materialize.
apparently,
the
jury
just
didn't
buy
that
theory
of
--
the
prior
robberies.
now,
if
you're
going
to
go
into
these
new
13
felonies
and
you're
going
to
have
to
be
very
well-acquainted
with
the
prior
cross-examination
of
the
witness
is
in
also
the
fact
of
alibis
if
the
defendants
have
them
and
how
you
could
confirm
the
alibis
by
other
independent
witnesses.
and
that's
why
i
say
it's
more
difficult
because
there
were
13
counsels
altogether,
different
things
--
different
robberies
of
different
occasions.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
it's
not
usual,
it's
not
unusual.
each
case
must
be
separate,
done
separately.
mr.
burton
marks
i
will
say
this.
the
court
knows
there
wasn't
much
said
about
this
170.6
motion
which
was
made
and
which
is
very
new
to
california
in
which
it
was
the
first
motion
made
where
they
approached
the
bench,
on
page
29,
and
170.6
is
a
new
code
of
civil
procedure
--
proceeding
which
is
called
an
affidavit
of
prejudice
in
which
you
can
disqualify
any
judge,
one
side
and
disqualified
any
judge
immediately
without
any
reason
consisted.
you
just
sign
an
affidavit
or
the
defendant's
suit
of
the
judge's
prejudice.
mr.
burton
marks
criminal
as
well
as
civil.
now,
at
that
--
that
time,
it
had
to
be
a
written
motion
made
five
days
in
advance.
that
has
been
changed
now.
now,
mr.
atkins,
we
assumed
he's
a
very
good
lawyer,
the
respondents
admit
that.
now,
if
--
apparently
he
didn't
come
to
the
defendants
within
five
days
because
he
didn't
present
the
affidavit
or
the
motion
for
continuance
until
the
date
of
trial.
and
i
assume
that
he
knew
the
law
so
that
means
he
must
not
have
presented
that
motion
in
time
otherwise
the
--
judge
rhone
who
tried
the
--
the
first
murder
case
would
never
had
been
sitting
in
the
robbery
case.
but
they
couldn't
get
him
disqualified
because
of
this
technicality
that
they
hadn't
noticed
the
motion
at
that
time
within
five
days
nor
file
the
affidavit
of
prejudice.
so,
i
--
this
maybe
some
indications
to
the
court
that
mr.
atkins
had
not
seen
the
defendants
or
prepare
for
the
case
within
five
days
prior
to
date
of
trial.
and
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
for
sure.i
would
like
to
get
on
to
the
--
mr.
burton
marks
thought
of,
what
sir?
mr.
burton
marks
well,
that
was
the
first
motion
made,
the
very
first
motion
that
mr.
atkins
made
was
to
disqualify
the
judge.
he
asked,
“may
we
approach
the
bench?”
and
page
29,
mr.
atkins,
“your
honor,
we
have
filed
the
affidavit.”
and
that
is
the
very
first
motion
he
made
so
it
couldn't
have
been
a
secondary
thought.
i'm
sure
it
was
a
first
thought
in
the
defendant's
mind.
when
they
talked
to
mr.
atkins,
they
didn't
want
to
have
judge
rhone
try
the
case
because
judge
rhone
had
tried
the
first
murder
case
and
i
understand
that
there
had
been
some
sort
of
conflict
going
on
between
prosecution
and
defense
at
that
time.
now,
getting
to
the
second
portion,
our
judges,
appellate
judges
and
lawyers,
i
referred
to
mr.
goertzen,
the
respondent's
brief
where
he
states
on
page
46,
“the
safe
to
assert
that
counsel
for
petitioners
would,”
that's
me,
“if
you
were
an
indigent
defender
rather
have
his
trial
record
reviewed
for
possible
error
by
a
group
of
experienced
appellant
justices
where
conscience
is
to
a
fault.”
that
was
my
words.
and
have
the
said
record
assigned
to
a
private
practicing
counsel
whom
he
treats
as
court
appointment
with
irritation
and
undue
hazed
as
many
do.
now,
i
take
great
--
i'm
abridging
that
and
i
disagree
greatly
because
i
sincerely
believe
that
i
would
rather
have
a
novitiate
attorney
review
my
record
on
appeal,
if
i
were
in
that
position,
than
any
appellate
justice.
the
reason
for
that
is
because
appellate
justices
are
not
advocates.
they
are
not
out
to
look
at
the
record
to
determine
error
and
find
the
error.
they
are
there
to
--
they
--
there's
a
different
slant.
they're
judges
and
they
don't
advocate
a
cause.
and
i'll
also
--
i
will
take
another
abridge
of
the
fact
that
private
practicing
counsel
treat
a
court
upon
with
irritation
because
in
los
angeles
county,
we
volunteer
into
the
appellate
courts,
so
we
submit
our
names
and
we
are
appointed
from
this
list
and
the
situation
which
occurred
is
this.
a
court
will
--
a
court
clerk
will
call
us
up
and
say,
“would
you
like
to
take
a
look
at
a
particular
case?”
and
you
say,
he's
certainly
send
over
the
record.
so,
either
we
pick
up
the
record
or
they
send
it
over
and
then
we
spent
some
time
or
eye
view.
i
look
over
the
record
very
carefully
to
see
whether
or
not
i
can
find
any
error
which
i
think
might
be
risk
and
i'm
not
looking
for
suspicious
error
and
i'm
not
trying
to
--
if
there
is
anything
which
i
think
could
be
raised,
i
will
then
write
to
the
court
and
say,
“please
appoint
me
because
i'm
going
to
take
it”
or
just
call
the
clerk
as
it
maybe.
if
i
think
that
the
record
is
error
free
or
if
i
think
that
there
is
possibly
part
of
the
record
that
isn't
apt
that
might
contain
error,
i
may
ask
for
that.
in
any
case,
if
i
don't
think
there
is
any
error,
i
will
so
inform
the
court
and
ask
that
i'd
be
relieved
as
appointed
counsel
and
ask
for
no
fee.
if
i
think
there's
error,
i
write
a
brief
and
maybe
i'm
wrong,
which
i
usually
am,
and
it's
affirmed
however
then
you
will
ask
for
reasonable
fees
to
be
paid.
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
same
practice
is
employed
by
an
appellate
justice
no
matter
how
conscientious
he
maybe
in
reviewing
a
record
because
he
is
looking
at
it
from
a
judges'
view
point.
he
isn't
looking
for
error.
and
i
think
an
outstanding
example
of
that
fact
is
that
error
which
to
me
was
patent
and
egregious
that
is
a
conflict
of
interest,
it's
denial
of
counsel.
on
that
ground
alone
was
--
was
completely
passed
over
by
the
appellate
justice
who
reviewed
the
court
--
review
the
record
and
only
brought
up
by
the
attorney
general.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
after
it
was
brought
up
by
the
attorney
general,
never
mentioned
the
end
of
the
decision
of
the
court.
and
again,
when
the
defendant
took
his
petition
for
review
up
to
the
california
supreme
court,
i
know
that
he
didn't
have
this
specification
of
the
error
in
it.
perhaps,
the
supreme
court
might
have
reviewed
it
on
that
ground
but
it
wasn't
there
--
it
wasn't
presented
in
a
proper
form.
it's
true
that
the
brief
covered
practically
everything,
every
legal
point
that
you
want
to
consider
but
it
was
a
hodgepodge
of
legal
justification
such
as
a
grand
jury
indictment
which
is
not
applicable
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
the
practice
of
--
of,
as
far
as
i
know,
of
appointing
counsel
has
been
quite
recent
about
five
years,
five
to
six
years.
now,
that's
all
they've
been
practicing.
mr.
burton
marks
right.
mr.
burton
marks
that's
all
i've
been
practicing
and
as
i
recall
in
the
first
year
of
practice,
i
did
not
get
any
assignments.
mr.
burton
marks
although
the
--
the
statute
is
old,
so
far
as
i
know,
in
allowing
compensation,
there
just
wasn't
this
practice
of
appointing
counsel.
i
think
it
really
came
into
full
bloom
after
the
griffin
decision
and
the
hyde
decision
of
the
supreme
court
where
they,
our
supreme
court,
where
they
decided
to
either
let
a
lawyer
review
it
or
a
judge
decide
if
a
lawyer
was
not
needed.
and
it's
a
second
advice
which
i
think
is
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law
because
if
you
are
going
to
grant
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
have
a
transcript
on
appeal,
if
you're
going
to
grant
the
right
he
has
the
--
needs
effective
assistance
of
counsel
then
the
two
go
hand
in
glove.
you
can't
have
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
--
or
--
or
the
transcript
is
worthless
unless
you
have
somebody
looking
at
the
record
who
knows
what
an
appeal
is
all
about
and
how
to
raise
error.
many
times,
you
can
look
in
an
appeal
and
find
to
your
chagrin
that
there's
a
beautiful
error
there
but
it
was
never
preserved
for
the
record
as
far
as
the
appellate
court
and
you
have
to
pass
it
up,
unless
it's
so
patent
and
egregious
that
they
say
you
waived
either
pay
or
to
object
was
waived.
i
--
mr.
burton
marks
which
man?
there
were
two
defendants.
mr.
burton
marks
they
dismissed
their
public
defender
after
he
stated
that
he
was
not
prepared,
after
he
stated
that
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest.
now,
we
have
two
different
situations.
we
have
mr.
douglas
who
had
previously
been
represented
by
a
private
attorney
and
then
ran
--
assume
ran
out
of
funds,
who
would
obviously
have
the
right
to
have
a
private
counsel
appointed
for
him
if
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest.
i
don't
think
that
the
inquiry
should
go
any
further
than
that.
now,
assuming
that
he
had
the
right
to
have
a
private
counsel
appointed
for
him
and
meyes
didn't,
still,
meyes
and
douglas
would
have
the
right
to
have
a
short
continuance
and
they
weren't
asking
for
a
long
continuance.
i
don't
think
anywhere
in
the
record
that
shows
that
they
--
these
tactics
were
dilatory
because
in
one
portion
of
the
record,
they
said
one
week
would
be
alright
but
give
us
a
chance
to
prepare
or
give
us
--
our
attorney
a
chance
to
prepare.
and
so
they
were
asking
for
a
short
continuance
in
order
to
prepare.
and
nowhere
in
the
record
could
i
find
any
place
where
the
people
were
objecting
that
the
continuance
would
put
them
to
a
disadvantage
because
already
this
case
had
been
going
out
as
i
believe
over
a
year
and
a
half
since
the
first
inception
of
the
murder
trial.
so
a
short
delay
wasn't
going
to
effect
their
prejudice
to
people's
point
and
that
was
never
the
argument
of
mr.
carr.
his
argument
was
not
that
we're
going
to
be
pre
--
prejudiced
but
the
--
the
defendants
are
trying
to
be
dilatory
and
they're
raising
these
suspicious
motions
for
defense.
i
think
the
judge
just
--
maybe
he
took
abridge
of
the
fact
that
an
affidavit
of
prejudice
was
filed
against
them.
although,
it's
never
intended
that
specific
way
some
judges
do
but
maybe
his
back
was
up.
in
any
case,
with
re
--
the
last
point
is,
with
respect
to
the
transcripts
on
appeal,
again,
we
have
a
very
peculiar
situation
and
especially,
with
respect
to
the
appellate
review
and
how
it
happened.
now,
mr.
meyes
was
filing
briefs.
they
both
asked
for
counsel
on
appeal.
they
both
asked
--
well,
douglas
asked
for
a
separate
transcript.
and
he
was
119
miles
away
from
meyes.
now,
if
he
had
been
given
counsel,
the
counsel
could
have
got
the
transcript.
he
could
have
gone
up
to
the
appellate
court
and
taken
their
transcript.
or
if
he'd
been
given
the
transcript,
maybe
he
could
have
prepared
his
own
brief.but
he
wasn't
given
any
either.
and
he
was
a
119
miles
away
in
a
different
prison.
and
although,
respondent
is
very
blight
to
say
they
--
there
wasn't
much
trouble
in
getting
transcripts,
i
submit
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
a
prison
to
get
anything.
and
there's
no
way
that
you
can
demand
it.
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
write
out
letters
and
make
petitions
and
make
prayers
for
things.
in
the
meantime,
meyes
was
very
busy
preparing
his
own
appeals
with
--
and
which
douglas
said,
“i
don't
want
to
adopt”
which
itself
indicate
some
sort
of
conflict
between
these
two
defendants.
and
that's
all
he
could
do
was
petition
the
court
for
this
additional
transcripts.
now,
as
far
as
an
additional
transcript
is
concerned,
in
the
beginning,
it
--
it
only
means
that
a
--
the
reporter
need
insert
an
additional
page,
copy
in
his
typewriter
in
order
to
produce
another
copy.
now,
they
both
filed
separate
appeals.
and
it
would
seem
that
they
both
have
the
right
to
transcripts
on
appeal.
and
as
i
say,
taking
griffin
versus
illinois
at
its
full
meaning,
it
has
no
meaning,
unless
you
say
that
the
transcript,
if
a
defen
--
indigent
defendant
has
the
right
to
a
transcript
where
an
opulent,
defendant
would
--
then
the
same
manner,
he
must
have
to
have
the
right
of
counsel
because
the
transcript
has
no
meaning
without
the
use
of
the
counsel.
i
suggest
that
the
holding
in
the
hynes
case
which
is
a
federal
case
that
the
sixth
amendments
affords
to
write
a
counsel
that
even
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
forma
pauperis
appeal
would
be
available.
it
is
more
inline
with
this
court's
decision
than
--
than
the
--
our
supreme
court's
decision
that
a
--
an
appellate
justice
can
look
at
the
record
and
by
looking
it
over,
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
need
for
counsel
on
appeal
because
after
all,
he
only
has
the
appellate
record
there
that
is
sent
up
in
the
ordinary
course.
now,
if
you
need
additional
record,
he
is
not
going
to
go
any
problem
--
trouble
to
move
the
court
for
additional
record
to
see
the
instructions
for
instance
that
were
given
whereas
a
private
counsel
would
if
he
were
at
all
conscientious.
and
i
don't
think
that
any
counsel
who
is
appointed
by
the
court
is
irritated
by
that
appointment
because
we
actually
volunteered
for
the
appointment
and
that
finishes
--
mr.
burton
marks
the
record
--
as
i
see,
this
was
mr.
mitchelson's
first
of
the
argument
but
i
do
state
this
--
mr.
burton
marks
he
--
he
was
going
to
unrebuttal
because
we
understand
that
the
--
the
one
of
the
major
portions
of
the
brief
of
the
respondent
is
that
they
--
there
was
no
showing
of
conflict
of
interest,
point
out
to
the
court
the
various
aspects
of
conflict
because
mr.
mitchelson
was
the
trial
counsel
for
douglas
in
the
murder
case.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
i
--
mr.
burton
marks
very
briefly,
the
conflict
of
interest
is
this.
if
i
were
an
attorney
for
a
defendant,
the
--
the
major
conflict
that
appears
is
that,
one
defendant
is
going
in
there
with
a
record,
prior
robberies,
prior
murder
charge
involving
the
same
situation
and
one
defendant
who
is
free
and
clear
of
any
charges
whatsoever.
now,
they've
both
been
through
the
same
trial.
i
can
think
of
--
one
situation
is
that
the
defendant
need
not
take
the
stand
in
a
murder
case
or
in
any
case
to
testify.
now,
in
california,
you
have
the
comment
rule.
now,
if
i'm
sitting
here
with
two
defendants,
one
on
my
right
and
one
on
my
left,
i
may
decide
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
have
defendant
meyes
take
the
stand
because
if
he
takes
the
stands,
he
can
be
impeached
and
quite
seriously,
by
the
murdered
conviction
and
the
prior
robberies
and
defendant
douglas
can't.
now,
how
can
i,
as
a
counsel,
who
must
conscientiously
devote
myself,
my
entire
zeal
and
energy
in
devotion
to
one
client,
stand
there
and
talk
about
mr.
douglas
as
being
a
nice,
clean
young
man
who
really
has
no
record
and
say,
“but
look,
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
meyes,
i
--
you
just
can't
do
it.”
you
cannot
say
this
man
is
good
and
is
bad
and
represent
them.
it
is
a
conflict
of
interest.
the
--
mr.
burton
marks
defendant
douglas
had
no
prior
criminal
record.
i
understand
he
had
a
misdemeanor
conviction
for
insufficient
funds.
mr.
burton
marks
insufficient
funds,
checks
which
is
--
mr.
burton
marks
right.
mr.
burton
marks
bad
check
in
which
on
misdemeanor
may
either
mean
under
$50
or
may
mean
that
the
court
made
a
misdemeanor
by
sense.
mr.
burton
marks
i
can
point
to
the
fact
that
mr.
carr
and
his
direct
examination
of
the
--
well
--
may
i
ask
mr.
mitchelson
to
take
over
that
portion,
if
it
would
be
alright.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
that
--
that's
true,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
your
honor,
i
only
can
say
that
i
see
no
reason
to
serve
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
why
they
didn't
want
to
delay
this
case.
prosecutor
talks
about
their
grant
standing
for
a
newspaper.
well,
that's
sort
of
ridiculous
because
what
could
be
gain
by
that?
i
see
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
then
i
better
sit
down.
mr.
burton
marks
mr.

justice
and
members
of
the
court.
going
to
the
chief
justice's
last
question,
i
think
it's
a
very
interesting
situation
that
the
court
might
be
informed
of
how
the
courts
do
work
in
los
angeles
county.
i'm
sure
the
chief
justice
has
an
intimate
acknowledge
and
i
know
that
i
have
a
very
intimate
knowledge.
the
fact
is
we
have
a
master
calendar
system,
and
the
--
a
person
is
arraigned
in
department
100.
he
is
then
assigned
to
one
of
approximately
20
superior
court
trial
calendars
and
each
trial
court
has
maybe
five
to
six,
i've
seen
as
many
as10
trials
scheduled
for
the
same
date.
now,
on
the
date
for
trial
--
mr.
burton
marks
yes,
but
only
--
mr.
burton
marks
about
20
are
assigned
to
criminal
--
mr.
burton
marks
permanent
for
a
year
and
generally
the
same
judges
request
assignment
to
the
superior
court
criminal
bench.
they
either
have
the
very
old
season
judges
or
the
very
new
appointees
who
get
criminal
assignments
because
they
were
not
suppose
to
be
the
most
desirable.
mr.
burton
marks
for
one
year.
mr.
burton
marks
now,
these
judges
have
an
extensive
calendar
and
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
a
criminal
case,
when
you
go
into
the
time
after
they'd
set
for
trial,
you
should
either,
as
private
counsel,
be
prepared
or
you
have
discussed
it
with
a
district
attorney
and
you
make
some
disposition
of
the
matter.
in
any
case,
it
generally
comes
down
to
the
fact
that
there
may
be
two
or
three
trials
scheduled,
and
then
--
that
are
going
to
definitely
go
ahead.
and
within
that,
the
ambit
of
that,
there
is
more
wheeling
and
dealing
because
there
are
sometimes
priors
alleged
and
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
prior
struck
if
you
waive
jury
and
you
might
also
be
able
to
get
a
submission
on
the
transcript
and
you
might
want
a
different
judge.
this
is
done
in
the
normal
course
of
business.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
it's
done
openly
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
working
done
between
counsel
and
the
public
defender
--
now
the
--
i
mean
the
prosecuting
attorney.
now,
the
interesting
thing
is
that
the
counsel
both
the
public
defender's
office
and
the
district
attorney's
office
are
assigned
to
each
particular
court.
so
the
defendant,
when
he
is
assigned
to
a
trial
court,
automatically
picks
up
the
public
defender
and
the
prosecutor
that's
assigned
to
that
court
unless
it's
a
very,
very
special
case.
now,
there
may
have
been
coincidence
in
our
case
or
there
may
have
been
a
plan
to
shoot
the
case
back
to
judge
ronword,
where
deputy
district
attorney
carr
was
sitting
anyway
department
104
so
he
would
be
familiar
with
the
case
at
hand.
now,
this
goes
directly
to
chief
justice
warren's
question.
now,
getting
one
step
further,
and
i
suppose
we
have
two
or
three
trials
in
one
court,
it
may
be
another
court
that
has
no
trials.
they
dispose
of
their
entire
calendar
perhaps
they
had
a
probation
sentence
calendar
that
morning
and
they
finish
it
early.
now,
we
have
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
earl
osatche
who
was
a
very
amiable
person
and
he
sits
up
there,
he
is
a
coordinator
and
he
has
every
case
down
in
every
court,
and
again,
there
is
a
sort
of
wheeling
and
dealing.
you
go
and
see
mr.
osatche
and
you
ask
him
what
courts
are
open
and
you
--
if
you
are
experienced
in
the
criminal
field
there,
you
know
which
judges
favor
certain
cases,
don't
favor
certain
cases,
and
you
try
and
get
your
client
the
best
possible
deal
by
getting
him
into
a
certain
judge,
if
that
court
is
open
and
if
you
can
get
in
there.
some
courts
will
open
say
for
just
half
an
hour
or
an
hour
and
if
you
can
state
that
your
trial
will
only
take
that
long,
you
will
get
transferred
into
that
matter.
so
therefore,
i
want
--
this
comes
down
to
the
conclusion
or
the
question,
was
there
any
prejudice
to
the
prosecution
or
the
people
or
to
the
courts
by
denying
a
continuance,
the
request
for
a
short
continuance
by
the
defendant's
counsel
who
was
then
counsel.
i
think
the
answer
must
be
‘no',
because
of
the
volume
of
business
that
extended,
none
of
the
courts
would
have
been
prejudiced.
there
are
always
two
or
three
cases
waiting
to
go
to
trial.
they're
always
continuing.
many
times
they
have
to
open
up
a
civil
court
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
business
for
a
criminal
trial.
so
--
mr.
burton
marks
for
continuance?
well
--
mr.
burton
marks
that's
true
but
assuming
that
the
request
for
continuance
was
proper
and
i
might
discuss
that
a
little
bit
later.
mr.
burton
marks
and
the
other
three
were
proper,
the
only
thing
that
would
happen
is
that
there
are
60
other
cases
ready
to
go
to
trial
that
day
and
they
will
fill
the
void
very
easily.
mr.
burton
marks
under
what
sir?
mr.
burton
marks
well
there
are
specific
causes
or
reasons
for
continuance
in
the
penal
code.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
prohibitions
in
the
penal
code
says
that
a
continuance
shall
not
be
granted
except
for
good
cause.
now,
what
is
good
cause
is
obviously
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
as
chief
justice
warren
indicated,
however
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
i
might
say
that
i
don't
believe
that
public
defenders
nor
private
counsel
for
the
most
part
and
this
represent
to
the
court
for
any
reason.
now,
there
are
many
reasons
why
you
--
you
aren't
prepared,
it's
mere
dilatoriness
on
your
part.
that's
--
i
think
the
court
can
reject
your
claim
of
not
being
ready.
they
also
--
there's
many
factors
a
court
has
to
take
into
consideration
in
granting
continuance.
one
is
convenience
of
witnesses.
well,
in
this
case,
there
obviously
were
several
private
witnesses
but
it
might
note
that
in
the
first
place,
they
were
--
had
already
been
called
to
court
twice.
and
this
was
at
--
on
this
case,
the
third
time,
for
reasons
--
let's
put
it
this
way.
for
reasons
known
only
to
the
district
attorney's
office,
they
preferred
to
charge
these
two
defendants
with
murder
and
not
the
robberies.
they
never
--
in
the
first
cases,
they
never
had
the
substantive
counts.
so
the
district
attorney's
office
charged
these
people
with
murder,
uses
the
facts
of
the
robbery
to
prove
the
lying
in
wait
or
a
consciousness
of
guilt
on
behalf
of
the
defendants
and
after
there
has
been
an
acquittal
of
one
of
the
defendants
files
the
13-robbery
counts
as
substantive
counts.
now
the
--
i
don't
think
that
the
district
attorney
can
stand
up
and
properly
say,
“we're
prepared
and
our
witnesses
are
here
so
you
can't
give
these
defendants
a
chance”.
and
i
also
think
that
under
the
circumstances
explained
by
mr.
mitchelson,
the
district
attorney
could
not
say
to
the
court
in
all
propriety
that
he
did
not
think
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
between
the
defendants.
one
of
the
--
going
into
conflict
situations,
i
--
the
attorney
general,
my
brothers
have
indicated
to
the
court
that,
for
some
reason
they
feel
that
conflict
exists
only
in
a
trial
in
the
factual
matter
consistent
with
the
actual
facts
of
the
case,
and
this
is
not
the
essence
of
conflict.
conflict
in
an
attorney
is
a
very
serious
thing.
we
have
a
canons
of
professional
ethics.
we
have
--
i
wanted
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
study
on
--
by
the
subcommittee
and
constitutional
rights,
the
united
states
senate,
that's
a
1961
printing,
68-881
and
they
cite
there
from
the
equal
justice
for
the
accused,
the
things
that
they
picked
should
be
provided
for
indigent
counsel.
number
one,
they
stated,
it
should
provide
for
every
indigent
person
who
faces
the
possibility
that
you
provide
counsel
for
every
indigent
person
who
faces
the
possibility
of
the
deprivation
of
his
liberty
or
rather
serious
criminal
sanctions.
and
the
system
should
afford
representation
which
is
experienced,
competent,
and
zealous.
i
think
that's
very
important.
the
system
should
provide
the
investigatory
and
other
facilities
necessary
for
a
complete
defense.
the
system
should
come
into
operation
of
a
sufficient
early
stage
of
the
proceeding
so
it
can
fully
advise
and
protect
and
it
should
continue
throughout
the
appeal.
and
the
system
should
assure
the
undivided
loyalty
by
defense
counsel
to
the
indigent
defendant.
and
that
is
the
one
main
thing
that
is
lacking
in
this
case
as
far
as
conflict
is
concerned
where
the
counsel
could
not
give
undivided
loyalty
to
both
defendants.
now
--
mr.
burton
marks
yes,
sir.
mr.
burton
marks
yes,
sir.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
i
was
going
--
i
would
sort
of
wrapping
it
in
because
when
we
get
to
the
other
questions
which
i
will
get
to
that
question
in
just
a
quick
minute.
what
i
wanted
to
state
was
this.
just
as
far
as
conflict
is
going
that
--
it
does
not
have
the
factual
situation.
i
might
refer
the
court
to
its
own
decision
that
sort
of
ties
in
connelly
versus
cochran
which
is
a
very
recent
decision.
when
you
come
to
the
situation
of
whether
or
not,
counsel
should
be
provided,
then
you
don't
ask
whether
or
not
the
man
has
made
an
intelligent
waiver
or
whether
he
requested
counsel,
and
i
think
this
goes
into
the
situation
of,
when,
myself
for
instance,
comes
in
front
of
the
court
and
i
say,
your
honor,
i
find
the
conflict
of
interest.
i
am
representing
as
an
officer
of
the
court
to
the
trial
judge
that
there
is
a
conflict
and
this,
i
do
not
believe
as
the
attorney
general
would
have
the
court
think
that
you
can
inquire
at
that
time
into
counsel's
reasons
for
stating
that
there
is
a
conflict.
i
don't
think
you
could
question
the
defendant
as
to
why
there
is
a
conflict.
i
think
that
the
minute
that
a
counsel
states
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest
that
ipso
facto
a
conflict
has
been
raised
--
mr.
burton
marks
i
think
it
does
because
the
judge
cannot
inquire
into
--
there's
--
first
of
all,
there
is
a
privilege
of
--
there
is
a
privileged
communication.
now,
counsel
may
have
received
a
privilege
communication
from
one
or
the
other
defendants,
which
he
cannot
reveal
to
the
court
so
the
court
cannot
inquire
that
counsel
what
that
privilege
communication
is,
and
the
only
thing
the
court
can
do
is
take
the
word
of
his
court
officer
that
there
is
a
conflict.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
to
any
counsel.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
he
would
still
have
to
make
a
motion
to
be
relieved,
and
i
think
that
the
court
should
obviously
grant
it
without
question
or
inquiry.
mr.
burton
marks
correct.
mr.
burton
marks
that's
correct.
now,
ordinarily
--
sir,
i'm
sorry
justice
harlan.
you
would
have
to
get
your
client's
permission
obviously
but
you
still
--
mr.
burton
marks
--
the
court's
permission
to
withdraw,
but
once
you
stated
to
the
court
there's
a
conflict
of
interest
and
you
stated
to
the
client
there's
no
question
that
you're
going
to
be
relieved.
now,
the
circumstances
in
this
case
are
that
the
public
defender
who
went
in
and
represented
that
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest,
was
only
there
a
few
minutes
prior
to
the
--
the
day
or
two
prior
to
the
trial
and
he
had
been
engaged
in
trial
and
obviously
was
quite
busy
as
the
entire
public
defender
system
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
burton
marks
the
stage
of
the
proceeding
as
shown
by
this
record
was
the
day
of
trial.
mr.
burton
marks
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial
within
the
scope
and
framework
of
these
various
motions
he
was
making.
mr.
burton
marks
for
continuance,
preparation,
and
also
conflict
of
interest,
and
i
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
in
between
some
of
the
motions
he
was
again
conferring
with
his
clients
and
he
--
mr.
burton
marks
perhaps
it
was
before
the
jury
was
sworn
or
called
--
mr.
burton
marks
--
which
is
another
thing
that
our
juries
are
not
sitting
there
in
the
court.
they
are
in
a
main
jury
room
and
when
they're
needed,
they're
called
out.
now
--
mr.
burton
marks
not
only
is
there
a
case
but
there's
a
specific
statute
and
i
think
it's
987a
which
provides
that
the
public
defender
cannot
serve
for
any
reason
then
a
private
counsel
should
be
appointed
and
compensation
is
given
by
the
court
at
its
discretion,
a
reasonable
compensation
which
is
taken
out
of
the
county
fund.
now,
getting
to
the
question
that
justice
stewart
and
justice
white
asked;
what
about
the
effect
of
the
appeal
if
you
should
find
that
counsel
should
be
appointed
on
appeal?
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
the
answer
in
our
case
because
if
you
reverse
it
merely
to
the
stage
of
the
post-conviction
point,
i
think
we've
already
gone
through
that
procedure
because
a
very
interesting
situation
arose.
mr.
goertzen
who
is
a
deputy
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
california
has
a
duty
to
represent
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
on
appeal,
and
also
being
very
conscientious
in
performing
his
duties
zealously,
he
raised
the
very
point
which
in
my
opinion
would
be
the
reversible
error
in
this
case,
and
that
is
to
with
the
conflict
of
interest.
now,
if
mr.
goertzen
raised
the
conflict
of
interest
in
his
brief,
and
he
cited
to
the
court
orally,
although
there
was
no
specific
argument,
he
did
refer
the
court
to
the
kerfoot
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
is
just
been
decided
a
few
days
later,
and
they
completely
ignored
this
issue
then
wouldn't
it
be
an
idle
act
to
reverse
the
case
to
the
--
only
to
the
appeal
stage
to
allow
the
california
court
to
review
something
which
it
has
already
reviewed.
mr.
burton
marks
it
has
fully
reviewed
it
in
the
sense
that
it's
been
briefed
but
it
never
reviewed
it
in
its
opinion.
it
completely
ignored
the
conflict
area.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
that
isn't
what
i
say.
i
think
counsel
would
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
practically
speaking,
if
this
case
was
reversed
down
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
and
counsel
was
then
appointed,
i
think
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
district
court
of
appeal
would
be
alerted
to
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
conflict
and
that
possibly
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
certiorari
had
been
granted
in
this
case
and
that
therefore
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
the
cert
has
been
--
a
petition
for
hearing
was
denied
in
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
burton
marks
yes,
very
definitely.
but
--
mr.
burton
marks
no,
it
was
never
argued
on
behalf
of
the
defendants.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
i
always
feel
that
if
my
opponent
raises
a
point
then
it's
pretty
--
and
it
almost
concedes
the
point,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
it's
pretty
well
raised
that
i
don't
--
can
feel
like
arguing
at
his
behalf,
but
this
is
--
this
is
one
of
those
peculiar
cases
where
it
just
passed
unnoticed
which
goes
--
now
very
briefly,
in
the
few
minutes
i
have
left,
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
appellate
judge
should
review
in
the
first
instance
as
the
california
rule
has
stated.
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
a
proper
rule.
i
don't
think
it's
constitutional.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
under
the
federal
law,
this
court
has
rejected
that
as
a
matter
of
due
process
of
law.
i
think
that
the
coppedge
case
recently
decided
is
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
it's
--
it's
due
--
i
interpret
it
as
a
semi
due
process
question
of
whether
or
not
the
indigent
has
a
right
to
get
into
court
before
he's
knocked
out
of
court.
and
in
this
case,
the
difference
here
is
we
have
the
record
prepared
and
the
court
made
a
decision
which
in
effect
was
saying
if
the
attorney
general
moved
to
dismiss
the
appeal
as
frivolous,
we
would
have
dismissed
it.
but
then
they
went
one
step
further
and
said,
“well
we're
not
going
to
dismiss
it
as
frivolous
but
we're
going
to
discuss
the
points
which
are
raised
in
their
brief
because
they
raised
the
brief
without
counsel
and
then
completely
missed
the
point
which
i
think
were
meritorious”.
i
don't
think
a
judge
who
is
sitting
as
a
judge,
and
this
was
discussed
yesterday
can
--
could
advocate
either
for
the
defense
or
for
the
prosecution.
he
sits
there
as
a
judge.
i
think
that
counsel,
one
of
the
functions
of
counsel
is
to
help
the
court
by
presenting
cases
to
the
court
and
arguments
and
propositions
of
law
which
then
the
court
decides
whether
true
or
false
or
applicable
or
not
applicable.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
the
function
of
this
court
is
a
little
bit
different
than
our
appellate
courts
because
the
difference
between
our
appellate
courts
and
this
court
is
that
everybody
has
a
right
to
appeal
in
california
--
mr.
burton
marks
right.
but
--
and
everybody
of
course
has
a
right
to
file
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
but
the
rules
of
court
are
somewhat
different.
in
california,
the
appellate
court
must
write
an
opinion
on
any
appeal
that's
filed
unless
the
appeal
is
dismissed.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
burton
marks
there
was
briefs
by
the
defendant's
pro
se
and
brief
by
the
respondent,
attorney
general
and
--
mr.
burton
marks
no,
the
rules
of
the
court
do
not
require
that
they'd
be
present.
the
rules
of
the
court
do
not
require
that
the
defendants
be
present
and
counsel
may
actually
submit
it
if
they
wish
unless
the
courts
have
any
question.
so
the
situation
--
mr.
burton
marks
i
would
say
that
in
a
situation
where
they're
in
prison
that
it
would
be
very
unlikely
that
they
would
be
present
although
they
might
be
permitted,
they
might
be
ordered
present.
i
don't
think
any
request
was
made.
i
think
by
the
time
that
the
matter
of
argument
came
up,
they've
been
pretty
well
decided.
there's
no
reason
to
ask
to
argue
because
they
--
that
would
have
been
denied
along
with
their
request
for
counsel
and
request
for
transcript.
the
--
my
time
is
up.
mr.
burton
marks
yes
sir.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
when
you
say
they
discharged
him,
i
think
--
mr.
burton
marks
i
don't
think
that
that
was
really
the
reason
because
it's
sort
of
intertwined.
at
first,
he
said
he
wasn't
prepared
and
then
he
said
he
was
and
i
think
at
that
point,
they
lost
confidence
in
the
counsel
not
because
of
this
particular
counsel
but
merely
because
he
wasn't
prepared
and
they
would
have
taken
any
counsel
who
was
prepared.
does
that
answer
your
question
and
perhaps
--
mr.
burton
marks
yes.
mr.
burton
marks
right.
and
they
have
just
no
choice
being
in
prison
or
confined
to
do
anything
else
but
assert
their
rights
which
i
think
they
did
very
effectively.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
it's
not
ley
de
situs
to
mr.
douglas.
i
wouldn't
--
i
would
certainly
--
mr.
burton
marks
no,
i
don't
think
he
would
have
--
he
would
--
if
he
had
been
given
a
counsel,
they
never
would
have
--
the
point
is
that
he
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
he
said
he's
not
prepared
but
the
conflict
question
is
inextricably
intertwined
immediately
before
you
even
come
to
the
preparedness
question.
i
think
that's
the
most
important
question
that
exists.
and
that
the
counsel
should
have
been
dismissed
regardless
of
whether
he's
prepared
or
not
prepared.
and
i
--
my
brother
counsel
points
out
that
douglas
stated
that
he
wanted
separate
counsel
at
the
beginning
--
mr.
burton
marks
may
i
look
at
in
the
record?
mr.
burton
marks
i
will
reply
it
in
rebuttal.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
after
the
--
when
the
appointment
--
the
appointment
is,
that's
a
peculiar
phraseology
because
the
appointment
of
counsel
actually
took
place
at
the
time
--
the
date
--
three
days
after
arraignment
when
the
judge
--
or
at
arraignment
when
the
judge
says,
do
you
have
a
counsel,
and
they
say
no.
he
says,
“do
you
have
money
to
employ
counsel?”
and
they
say,
no
he
says
appoint
the
public
defender
and
the
public
defender
is
appointed,
but
which
public
defender
is
appointed,
they
don't
have
any
idea.
mr.
burton
marks
it's
going
to
be
one.
mr.
burton
marks
right.
mr.
burton
marks
right,
but
they
--
mr.
burton
marks
they
didn't
see
the
public
defender
that
they
were
--
he
was
going
to
be
appointed
for
the
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
how
could
they
raise
it?
they
don't
have
conflict.
the
public
defender
raised
the
conflict.
mr.
burton
marks
i
say
it
was
important
as
a
matter
of
right.
thank
you.
