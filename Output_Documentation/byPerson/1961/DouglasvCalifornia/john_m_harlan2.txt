justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
this
man
dismissed
the
public
defender,
this
is
his
lawyer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
petitioner
who's
up
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
at
what
stage
was
the
--
mr.
atkins
asked
or
did
the
defendants
indicate
they
wanted
--
they
didn't
want
to
be
represented
by
mr.
atkins.
what
stage
were
all
these?
justice
john
m.
harlan
after
the
motion
for
the
continuance
or
denial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
affidavit
of
prejudice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
after
the
motion
for
continuance
had
been
denied,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
old
are
these
two
defendants?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
actual
case
we
--
we're
concerned
with?
the
september
30
--
i
--
i
believe
three
days.
the
jury
came
in
on
october
7th.
justice
john
m.
harlan
12
weeks,
i
believe,
mr.
mitchelson
said.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
recall
this,
justice
black.
it
really
was
a
subsidiary
case.
they
--
the
bulk
of
the
witnesses
called
at
the
murder
trial
were
actually
witnesses
in
the
apartment,
police
officers
and
everything
to
establish
the
circumstances
of
the
--
of
the
actual
arrival
there
by
the
police,
the
--
the
attempt
to
find
these
--
these
two
men.
what
--
what
the
officer
surviving
recalls
is
that
the
officer
going
down
the
hall
and
this
and
that.
there
were
ambulance
attendants
called
and
then
there
--
there
was
lengthy
evidence
on
admissions
and
confessions
given.
and
i
believe
mr.
mitchelson
can
vouch
for
this
that
that
aid
up
quite
a
bit
at
the
trial,
the
actual
admissions
on
the
--
on
the
murder
case
itself.
the
robberies
were
just
that
offered
on
that
specific
theory
to
show
that
that
was
why
the
officers
were
going
there
and
that
the
defendants
knew
of
it.
in
fact,
meyes
made
damaging
admissions
at
the
murder
trial
that
he
did
know
or
equivocally
but
from
the
record,
you
--
you
got
feeling
that
he
did
know
that
was
why
they
were
there
and
things
like
that.
but
that
was
all
the
robberies
were
offered
for.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that
rule
quoted
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that
rule
quoted
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
(voice
overlap)
--
number
of
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
35?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
i'll
find
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
suppose
the
public
defender
of
the
--
request
had
been
honored
would
have
the
counsel
or
would
been
appointed
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
murder
charged
of
felony
murder?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
same
felony?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
a
disagreement
on
the
first
murder
trial
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
hung
jury.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
still
a
little
confused.
i
thought
you
said
the
murder
charge
was
a
felony
murder
charge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
--
what
i
mean
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
not
a
charge
of
killing
in
the
course
of
the
commission
of
an
independent
felony.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know.
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
premeditated
murder.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
spend
any
time
on
the
question
that
justice
white
asked
your
colleague
questionably
whether
these
people
were
entitled
to
counsel?
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
appeal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
haven't
gotten
with
that
yet.
nobody
has
discussed
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
a
lawyer
goes
before
a
state
court,
says
i
think
there's
a
conflict
of
interest
that
forecloses
any
exercise
of
discretion,
any
appraisal
of
the
situation
by
the
judge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
he
would
have
to
get
the
court's
permission.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court's
permission.
justice
john
m.
harlan
page
what
please?
justice
john
m.
harlan
very
well.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
also
true
in
the
middle.
he
says,
for
that
--
he
talks
about
douglas
thinking
there
might
be
a
conflict
but
then
he
puts
his
weight
behind
it,
perhaps
not
very
heavily
but
he
says
for
that
reason
amongst
others,
i
think
that
perhaps
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
for
the
well
founded
reason.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
one
more
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
don't
you
have
to
distinguish
between
the
conflict
that
existed
which
your
adversary
admits
on
the
murder
trial,
and
the
conflict
as
you
claim
that
existed
on
the
case
with
which
we're
here
concerned.
what
you
have
been
talking
about
relates
to
the
murder
trial,
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
conflict
that
is
claimed
to
have
existed
in
this
case,
relates
to
two
things:
(1)
the
fact
that
douglas
was
acquitted
on
the
murder
trial,
and
(2),
the
fact
that
meyes
in
contradistinction
to
douglas
had
a
long
criminal
record.
isn't
that
the
only
elements
--
aren't
those
the
only
elements
of
conflict?
