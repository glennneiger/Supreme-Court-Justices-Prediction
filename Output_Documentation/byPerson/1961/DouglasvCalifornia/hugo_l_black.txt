they

now,
i

know
how
the
time
that
the

use
compared
in
the
two
cases.
justice
hugo

black
well,
i
was
asking
you
the
question
on
this
basis.
they
claimed
that
they
were
not
properly
represented.
and
here,
you
have
a
case
where
(inaudible)
referred
to
as
being
very
much
the
same,
took
8
weeks
--
4
weeks
to
try
the
two
murder
cases.
three
days
to
try
their
robbery
cases
where
the
defendants
did
not
have
lawyers.
does
the
fact
that
they
did
not
have
lawyers
have
anything
to
do
with
that?
justice
hugo

black
what
you
really
have
is,
isn't
it
that
they
declined
to
take
this
man?
justice
hugo

black
and
they
insisted
that
they
want
to
continue
it.
justice

i
mean,
they
declined
to
let
him
continue
the
reference
(voice

--
justice

and
the
court
exercised
this
judgment
and
decided
that
they
could
take
him
and
have
nobody.

about
like
people
without

would.
they

the
case,
isn't
it?
justice

black
--
(voice

--
no
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
regards
to
that,
it
violated
due
process,
is
it
not?
i
presume
looking
at
it
in
this
difference
having
happen.
it
might
have
been
better
if
he'd
waited
few
days
and
see
if
they
can
get
a
lawyer,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo

is
what
the
judge
said
they're
correct?
had
there
been
three
continuances?

page
36,
right
after
that
statement
you
read.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
we
have
to
believe
from
the
record,
they
were
not
from
all
his
words,
they
didn't
want
this
man
and
they
wanted
to
transfer
and
get
somebody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
that
decides
your
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
he
had
--
had
been
a
motion
to
disqualify
which
he
denied
on
the
ground,
they
were
too
late,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
it
have
to
be
put
on
that
sole
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
--
would
that
not
be
enough
to
consider
along
with
other
circumstances
in
reaching
the
conclusion
where
there's
been
denial
of
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
meant
was
if
you
say
we
--
we
want
to
transfer
the
federal
rule
of
conflict
directly
there
but
that
would
assume
that
the
conflict
is
the
only
thing
which
would
justify
a
holding
that
maybe
these
people
had
not
given
the
count
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
right
the
count.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
when
one
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
which
ruled
out
of
the
identical
transaction
which
the
two
are
being
tried
on
their
second
trial
and
the
counsel
claimed
was
that
the
man
who
represented
the
one
who
had
then
acquitted
but
suddenly,
they've
tried
to
use
that
for
the
decided
advantage
of
proving
the
purity
of
his
witness
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
defendant
is
against
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
seen
you
that
for
this
reason,
that's

i
don't
know
how
much
we
have
a
right
to
consider
our
own
views,
dispute.
justice
hugo

but
i
was
hesitated
about
taking
a
case
for
both
defendants
under
those
circumstances
whether
that
rises
to
due
process
or
to
different
thing.

justice

justice

black
as
a
lawyer,
what
would
be
your
main
argument
if
you
are
representing
the
man
who
has
been
acquitted?
you
were
standing
up
before
the
jury
representing
him
alone.
what
would
you
drive
on
the
most
physical?
would
you
ignore
the
fact
that
he
has
been
acquitted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
emphasize
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
did
there.
justice

black
that's
a
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.

suggestion
if
you
defended
it.
you
would
emphasize
that
thereby
in
your
--
justice
hugo

--
defense
of
him
alone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
couldn't
do
it
if
you
represented
both,
could
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
court
could
keep
that
effect
if
one
had
been
acquitted
and
one
of
them
convicted?
justice
hugo

black
you
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
true.
that
would
make
a
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presumed
that
there
had
been
many
questions
asked
in
the
cross-examination.
did
you
testify
the
murder
trial
against
these
people
or
would
you
say
there,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
could
escape
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
strenuously
argued,
didn't
he
that
there
would
be
a
conflict
and
he
didn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he,
as
a
public
official,
a
public
defender,
did
not
want
to
try
to
represent
both
of
them
at
the
same
time.

well,

i'll

word.
justice

that,
wasn't
it?
justice

you
don't
have
to
be
a

lawyer

all
that.

(inaudible)

does
the
record
show
who
wrote
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
time
is
up
but
i
want
to
ask
just
two
brief
questions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
record
shows
that
douglas
asked
the
court
after
he'd
been
convicted
by
the
jury
and
before
he
was
sentenced
to
appoint
him
a
lawyer
in
order
to
make
a
motion
for
new
trial
and
that
the
judge
refused,
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
asked
for
the
court
to
appoint
a
lawyer
to
prepare
a
motion
for
new
trail,
he
said
he
wanted
to
make
one
but
he
didn't
know
how
to
do
it.
and
he
asked
the
court
to
appoint
him
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
statutory
grounds,
what
--
what
do
say
about
that
court's
refusal
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
give
him
a
lawyer
to
make
the
motion
for
new
trial?
do
you
think
his
insistence
that
he
didn't
what
atkins
carried
over
to
that
time
so
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
court
still
refused
to
appoint
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
didn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
did
at
that
time,
asked
him
unequivocal
to
appoint
him
a
lawyer
if
the
judge
told
him
he
had
--
he
had
one
and
he
had
discharged
that
lawyer
and
he
said
he
wanted
a
lawyer
to
have
him
prepare
motion
for
a
new
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
lawyer
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
that's
the
lawyer
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
did
not
wanted
to
try
that
case
because
he
was
not
prepared.
but
i
judge,
he
would
have
been
prepared
to
make
a
motion
for
new
trial.
i
see
no
reason
why
he
wouldn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo

black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
a
lawyer
could
do
it
better
than
a
layman
of
course.
now,
one
other
question,
i
notice
in
the
argument
to
the
jury,
the
state's
attorney
referred
to
the
fact
that
they
murdered
the
policeman,
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
page
162
in
the
argument,
the
state's
attorney
to
the
jury
said
that
evidence
was
introduced
in
the
brief,
show
consciousness
of
guilt
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
the
officer
comes
to
arrest
him
for
crime.
they
shoot
the
officer
and
only
be
considered
by
you
for
that
specific
and
particular
purpose.
i'd
understood
that
the
murder
trial
played
no
part
in
the
robbery
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
jury
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
jury
told
that
douglas
has
been
acquitted
or
that
meyes
has
been
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.

is
that
case
from
which
you
read
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
it.
well,
i
--
what
is
it?
will
you
give
it

what
i

justice

i
guess
his
strongest
statement
is
on
page
32,
isn't
it,
right
at
the
end
of
that?
justice
hugo

black
with
all
those
reasons,
he
thought
it
would
be
manifestly
unfair
