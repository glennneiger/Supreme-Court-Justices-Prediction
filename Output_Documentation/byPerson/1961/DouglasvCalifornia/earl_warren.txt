meyers
or

petitioners,
versus
california.
mr.
marks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
--
how
long
did
this
public
defender
have
to
prepare?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
wouldn't
say
that
was
an
abnormal
time,
would
you,
so
far
as
shortness
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
in
the
absence
of
a
gross
--
gross
--
abuse
of
discretion,
but
that
is
a
discretionary
matter
with
the
court,
is
it
not
to
--
to
say
whether
a
man
is
--
is
that
ample
time
to
prepare?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
a
pretty
--
pretty
common
thing
for
lawyers
to
say
they
haven't
had
time
to
prepare.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
that's
what
i
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
was
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
--
for
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
the
evidence
here
is
such
that
it
was
abused?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
let's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
let's
just
don't
take
the
conflict
of
interest.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
let's
just
take
everything
on
whether
or
not
he
was
in
--
the
court
was
entitled
to
put
him
to
trial
the
counsel
in
--
in
the
situation
he
was.
is
there
anything
else
besides
after
he
said
he
wasn't
prepared?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
los
angeles
county?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
rather
large
office
there,
don't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
about
60?
chief
justice
earl
warren
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
unusual
in
los
angeles
county
to
try
a
defendant
within
39
days
of
his
arraignment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
criminal
case
as
well
as
a
civil
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
that
they
opened
this
to
another
inference
too
that
--
that
they
just
thought
of
that
when
they
couldn't
get
a
continuance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
disqualifying
the
judge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask,
just
a
matter
of
information?
how
long
has
the
state
been
compensating
the
assigned
counsel?
is
it
quite
recent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
compensating
--
but
compensating
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
what
i
(inaudible).
i
thought
it
was
quite
recent?
i
didn't
remember
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
stating
to
us
what
the
record
shows
about
conflict
of
interest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
was
mr.
mitchelson
involved?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
--
isn't
it
rather
an
order
to
have
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
file
rather
than
rebuttal
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
these
defendants
have
any
other
criminal
records?
chief
justice
earl
warren
insufficient
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
passing
a
check
without
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
bad
check.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
in
the
reason
that
--
that
you've
been
point
to
as
--
on
conflict
of
interest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
you
may
have
it.
mr.
mitchelson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
we
get
--
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
we
get
to
that,
would
you
please
point
out
to
me
in
the
record
how
the
conflict
was
presented
to
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
--
what
was
said
to
the
court
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
36,
right.
what
part
of
the
page
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
35?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
oh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
articulated
to
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
is
this
just
your
--
your
argument
to
(voice
overlap)--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
where
--
where
in
is
that
pointed
up
to
the
court
in
that
citation
there
on
page
67?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
are
you
reading
from
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
this
--
suppose
this
was
a
private
counsel
employed
by
--
by
the
defendants,
will
it
make
any
difference
in
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
no
matter
how
much
time
they'd
have
--
the
lawyer
had
to
prepare
before
hand.if
he
hadn't
prepared
and
came
in
to
court
and
said
that
he
was
not
prepared
that
the
judge
would
be
obliged
to
give
him
a
continuance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let's
say
that
they
did
want
to
get
--
they
did
want
a
continuance
and
--
and
even
though
they
had
paid
for
this
counsel,
would
the
court
be
obliged
in
these
circumstances
to
--
to
give
us
continuance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
a
public
defender
or
a
private
counsel?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
are
you
reading
from
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
counsel
say
that
--
that
there
never
has
been
a
motion
for
continuance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
where
--
where,
right
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
we
know
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
counsel
didn't
call
up
the
attention
of
the
court
or
did
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think
he
said
it
made
no
investigation.
i
think
on
page
29,
he
said
that
--
that
we
have
a
great
number
of
witnesses
for
which
subpoenas
were
issued
--
no,
that's
--
that's
carr.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
said,
“there
are
so
many
that
it
is
difficult
to
check
each
one
and
develop
the
people
who
might
have
known
these
men
and
who
might
for
one
reason
or
another
be
able
to
remember
certain
days.
for
that
reason,
we
have
not
been
able
to
complete
the
investigation,
contact
these
people
and
interrogate
them,
asking
them
their
possible
reasons
for
remembering
certain
days.
we
have
just
not
been
able
to
complete
that
investigation.”
he
didn't
say
he
never
made
an
investigation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
least
there,
he
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
says,
“there
are
so
many
that
it
is
difficult
to
check
each
one,
each
one.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
james.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
pardon
me.
yes,
mr.
goertzen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
what
--
he
went
a
little
further,
didn't
he?
and
then
--
then
he
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
august
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
the
two
trials
took
12
weeks?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
james.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
didn't
asked
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
william
douglas
and
bennie
will
meyes,
petitioners,
versus
california.
mr.
mitchelson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
disqualify
himself
for
any
stated
reason
or
just
to
recuse
himself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
represent
douglas
in
this
robbery
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
court
is
this
speaking?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mitchelson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
telling
us
very
briefly
how
these
robbery
cases
came
into
the
murder
case
just
the
factual
situation
so
you
have
to
connect
with
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
very
briefly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
did
the
facts
developed?
where
--
where
was
this
man
arrested
and
under
what
circumstances
and
what
brought
the
robbery
--
robbery
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
puts
it
in
perspective
for
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
he
appointed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
your
judge
--
when
your
judge
appoints
a
public
defender,
he
doesn't
appoint
john
jones
of
the
public
defender's
office
to
represent
him,
does
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
represents
the
public
defender's
office
of
los
angeles
county.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
as
you
say,
they
have
about
100
deputies.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
--
that's
a
matter
of
circumstance
only
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
that
way,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
suppose
that
in
all
events,
it
could
not
be
said
that
the
public
defender's
office
as
an
institution,
could
not
reasonably
have
been
prepared
for
that
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
alright.
in
those
circumstances,
isn't
it
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
judge
to
determine
whether
there's
going
to
be
continuance
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
any
--
can
any
lawyer,
whether
he's
paid
or
whether
he's
public
defender
just
walk
in
and
say,
you
honor,
this
--
i
came
in
the
case
six
weeks
ago,
but
i'm
just
not
prepared
and
not
ready
to
go.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
my
mind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
after
--
after
he's
been
appointed
by
the
court
and
accepted
by
the
defendant,
is
there
--
does
he
have
any
different
status
before
the
court
than
a
paid
attorney?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
this
was
--
this
was
paid
counsel
who
made
exactly
the
same
representations
to
the
court;
you
believe
then
that
the
court
could
have
compelled
him
to
proceed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
don't
change
any
facts
except
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
change
a
single
fact
except
that
in
one
case,
the
man
is
--
the
public
defender,
he
was
here,
and
in
the
other
case,
we
would
have
been
paid
a
lawyer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
then
whether
he's
a
paid
counsel
or
public
defender,
they're
both
in
the
same
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
having
some
knowledge
of
the
calendar,
criminal
calendar
in
los
angeles
county,
i
would
say
that
the
courts
would
be
in
a
rather
weak
position
to
get
their
work
done
if
every
time
the
public
defender
came
in
and
said,
“i'm
not
prepared,”
to
be
entitled
to
a
continuance
as
a
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
marks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
assigned
normally
for
a
year
at
a
time,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
what
stage
of
the
proceedings
did
counsel
raise
the
conflict
of
interest
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
beginning
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
didn't
get
into
the
middle
of
taking
of
testimony
and
then
--
then
the
issue
being
raised.
it
was
done
before
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
normally,
they
are
not
permitted
to
request?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
--
begin
--
when
do
you
refer
to
as
the
beginning?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
so
you
mean
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
or
when
he
was
--
when
they
were
appointed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
goertzen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
still
don't
--
i
still
don't
get
the
sequence
on
the
conflict
of
interest
issues
to
when
it
was
raised
and
how
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
you
--
would
you
please
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
allowed,
you
say
the
preemptory
challenge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
the
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
timeliness.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
these
men
also
had
been
in
jail
ever
since
they
had
been
charged
with
the
murder.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
had
that
been
before
this
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
counts
of
robbery
were
there
in
this
information?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
how
many
--
how
many
witnesses
were
essentially
tried
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
mr.
goertzen,
that
takes
us
back
to
mr.
justice
white's
original
question.
will
you
state
specifically
what
the
public
defender
represented
to
the
trial
court
on
the
question
of
conflict
of
interest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
will
--
will
we
find
it
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
goertzen,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
anything
that
developed
in
the
murder
trials
themselves
to
indicate
a
conflict
between
these
two
defendants
so
far
as
their
defense
was
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
was
there
an
actual
conflict
in
the
evidence
so
far
as
the
defense
was
concerned
and
the
defense
--
for
instance,
did
douglas
give
the
testimony
that
was
recounted
in
that
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
did
he
in
that
--
say
that
meyes
was
the
fellow
who
did
the
shooting
and
so
forth
in
the
trial
court
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
about
the
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
this,
mr.
goertzen,
how
about
the
incident,
the
time
they
were
arrested
and
the
time
of
the
shooting
took
place.
did
either
of
them
in
the
trial
tried
to
blame
it
on
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
reconcile
or
reconcile
the
testimony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
james.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
james,
what
happens
--
what
happens
when
a
man
does
not
have
counsel
on
appeal
and
he's
in
the
penitentiary?
what
are
the
proceedings
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
we
take
--
i'm
taking
the
position
where
--
where
he
doesn't
have
counsel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
us
say
he
does
request
it
and
the
court
says
it
isn't
necessary
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
before
we
get
--
before
we
get
to
that,
i'd
like
to
clear
up
this
procedural
matter.
meyes
and
douglas
were
denied
counsel
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
were
permitted
to
write
their
own
briefs.
meyes
did
write
his
own
brief.
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now
what
procedure
do
you
have
in
the
court
of
appeals
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
waived
by
who?
waived
by
who
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
attorney
general,
so
how
about
meyes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
let
me
stick
with
the
procedure
a
moment.
now,
when
the
briefs
were
filed
and
it
was
set
for
hearing,
the
attorney
general
waived
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
about
meyes,
was
he
permitted
to
be
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
did
he
waive
argument
or
they
just
proceeded
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
his
absence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
now,
would
that
same
procedure
--
could
that
same
procedure
be
followed
if
a
man
had
a
paid
lawyer?
could
they
proceed
without
their
lawyer,
without
the
man's
lawyer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it's
provided
for,
but
now,
let's
suppose
that
the
man
had
a
paid
attorney
and
the
court
said,
“well,
we're
going
to
the
--
the
attorney
general
has
waived
the
argument
so
you
cannot
have
a
hearing
for
this
so
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned.
we
won't
listen
to
any
argument
from
you.”
is
that
--
is
that
in
accordance
with
the
california
system?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
what
distinction
there
is
in
the
consideration
the
court
gives
to
a
case
where
the
defendant
on
appeal
has
no
lawyer
and
in
the
case
where
he
does
have
a
lawyer.
in
one
case,
as
i
understand
you
now,
the
court
must
hear
the
lawyer
if
he
wants
to
be
heard.
in
the
other
case,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
man
wants
to
be
heard
or
not
he
isn't
heard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
if
he
is
in
jail,
they
just
don't
do
that,
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
my
experience.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
james,
we're
going
to
recess
now
but
this
afternoon,
i'm
going
to
ask
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
although
their
time
is
up,
if
they
will
point
out
to
us
in
the
trial
transcript
of
the
murder,
what
testimony
there
was
on
behalf
of
the
defendants
to
show
a
conflict
in
defenses
as
between
them,
do
i
make
myself
clear
on
that?
alright,
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
james,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
they
both
claim
that
it
was
whatever
was
done
by
either
of
them
was
done
as
self-defense
because
the
officer
shot
first.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
wouldn't
you
have
anything
to
add
to
what
mr.
goertzen
has
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes
that's
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
at
the
murder
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
which
you
read
to
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
that
get
--
how
did
that
get
into
the
appeal
if
it
wasn't
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
that
was
a
statement
that
some
police
officer
took
from
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
made
any
such
statements?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
douglas
deny
that
he
had
made
the
statement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
the
question
was
answered
for
me
anyway.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
excuse
me,
justice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
the
questions
had
been
answered
now.
that's
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
