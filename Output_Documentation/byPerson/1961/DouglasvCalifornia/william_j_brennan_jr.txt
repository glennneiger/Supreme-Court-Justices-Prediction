(inaudible)
justice

and
all

are
of
all
the
(inaudible)
which
had
been

remind
the
way
police

is
good.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

then
the
way
the
subject
was
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
when
on
that
where
the
offenses,
13,
were
they
offenses
over
a
period
of
time
or
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
they
had
non-capital
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
months
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
they
--
they
were
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.

--
(voice

--
at
page
81?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apparently
--
whatever
the
justifications
were,
they
have
it
very
clear
from
the
very
beginning
they
want
to
have
contracts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
right
about
this?
looking
at
this
transcript,
it
appears
to
be
about
58
pages
of
trial
testimony
at
this
trial
after
atkins
had
been
dismissed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
am
i
right
that
these
defendants
virtually
stood
mute
for
the
rest
of
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
did
(voice
overlap)
after
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
didn't
cross-examine
the
witnesses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
didn't
summon
up
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
offered
no
witnesses
of
their
own?
they
didn't
expand?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
that's
why
you
took
apparently
about
9
or
10
witnesses
here
and
their
testimony
takes
only
about
58
pages.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
even
the
three
days
includes
all
of
the
proceedings
up
to
the
time
of
atkins
dismissal,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
trial
itself,
when
they
finally
got
--
they're
taking
testimony,
took
how
long?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
doesn't
follow.
they
knew
how
to
defend
themselves.
the
counsel
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
thought
--
like
i
thought
could
be
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
brennan?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
start
to
say
something
an
explanation
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
judge's
statement
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
have
any
suggestions
of
severance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they're
also
i
think
it
will
make
an
afford
counsel
and
may
argue
even
frivolous
appeals,
are
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
in
that
sense,
i
gather
the
examination
by
the
judges
were
they
decide
no
purpose
of
reserving
appointing
counsel
must
be
on
the
ground.
i
suspect
that
just
no
merit
in
any
points
raise
on
the
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
of
this
paid
counsel,
paid
counsel
may
take
up
the
time
to
the
court
arguing
a
frivolous
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
my
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
he
may
--
he
will
be
heard
in
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whether
or
not,
it's
constitutionally
discrimination.
certainly,
it's
discrimination
in
the
sense
that
the
indigent
does
not
have
this
case
orally
argued
before
the
appellate
judges,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
a
signature?
