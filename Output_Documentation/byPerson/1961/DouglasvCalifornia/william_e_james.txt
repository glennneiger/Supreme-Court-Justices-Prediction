mr.
william
e.
james
honorable
chief
--
mr.
william
e.
james
honorable
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
i
will
devote
what
is
left
of
the
argument
to
point
number
two
which
has
been
advanced
by
these
petitioners.
mr.
goertzon
has
covered
the
aspect
of
due
process
and
the
claim
of
denial
thereof
at
the
trial.
these
petitioners
also
complained
that
they
were
denied
due
process
and
equal
protection
on
the
appeal
because
the
appellate
court
did
not
appoint
counsel
to
them
and
therefore,
they
were
discriminated
because
of
their
poverty.
we,
of
course,
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
or
substance
to
this
claim
and
that
these
defendants
as
are
all
indigent
defendants
in
the
state
of
california
are
accorded
a
full
effective
appellate
review,
required
both
by
the
state
constitution
and
the
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution.
now,
the
claim
in
this
regard
is
presented
in
two
aspects.
the
first
aspect
is
the
claim
that
one
of
these
petitioners
did
not
get
himself
an
individual
copy
of
the
reporter's
transcript
and
the
clerk's
transcript.
and
therefore,
he
was
denied
some
right
to
present
anything
to
an
appellate
court.
and
1the
second
aspect
is
that
both
of
these
petitioners
were
denied
appointment
of
counsel
by
an
appellate
court
and
therefore,
because
of
their
indigency,
they
were
denied
a
right.
well,
inherent
and
implicit
in
this
particular
attack
upon
the
judgments
of
the
california
court
is
the
claim
that
california's
appellate
procedure,
as
it
relates
to
defendants
both
indigent
and
those
who
are
wealthy,
is
discriminatory
because
of
the
particular
financials
status
of
the
appellant.
and
as
we
will
point
out
in
the
time
remaining,
the
entire
appeal
procedure
in
the
states
was
thoroughly
in
accordance
with
state
law.
and
it
is
only
be
by
holding
that
the
rules
of
appeal
in
the
state
of
california
and
the
provisions
of
the
penal
code
of
that
state
are
a
denial
to
indigent
defendants
of
equal
protection
that
we
can
strike
down
these
particular
judgments
on
the
basis
of
this
claim.
first,
we
should
perhaps
examine
just
what
happens
in
california
when
an
appeal
is
taken
by
the
--
by
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
from
a
judgment
of
conviction
in
the
superior
court.
in
california,
a
--
an
appeal
is
instituted
by
filing
a
written
notice
of
appeal
within
10
days
after
the
judgment
or
order
from
which
the
appeal
is
taken
with
the
clerk
to
the
superior
court.
there's
no
fee
required
for
the
filing
of
this
notice.
it
can
be
a
handwritten
document
as
where
the
documents
in
this
particular
case,
delivered
to
the
clerk.
california,
in
aid
of
indigent
defendants,
while
the
rule
is
generally
that
this
10-day
period
is
mandatory
and
jurisdictional
has
held
that
where
an
indigent
is
in
prison
and
because
of
the
mailing
conditions
of
the
prison
is
unable
to
timely
file
his
notice
of
appeal.
it
will
be
presumed
that
there
was
a
constructive
filing
and
he
is
allowed
his
appeal
regardless
of
the
timeliness
of
the
filing
of
the
notice.
now,
this
institutes
the
appeal.
and
certainly,
this
is
not
a
denial
to
an
indigent
defendant
of
any
right.
now,
when
the
appeal
is
instituted,
there
is
prepared,
as
a
matter
of
course,
what
is
denominated
a
normal
record
on
appeal.
and
these
consist
of
the
clerk's
transcript,
consisting
of
the
pleadings,
the
motions,
the
clerk's
minutes,
the
judgment
and
the
notice
of
appeal.
in
addition,
there
is
a
reporter's
transcript
which
is
prepared
at
county
expense,
not
at
the
expense
of
the
particular
appealing
party
but
prepare
at
the
expense
of
the
county.
this
contains
the
oral
proceedings
on
the
taking
of
evidence,
objections
made
and
the
rulings
of
the
court
on
the
objections
to
introduction
of
evidence
and
it
also
contains
the
oral
proceedings
taking
at
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
in
addition,
the
appellant
may
request
that
if
he
shows
good
cause
for
an
additional
or
augmented
record
and
this
was
done
in
this
case.
these
particular
petitioners
requested
an
augmented
record
and
their
request
was
honored
and
granted
and
the
court
made
an
order
granting
these
defendants
more
than
the
normal
record
on
appeal
so
that
they
could
have
an
effective
appellate
review
of
the
proceedings
that
took
place
in
the
trial
court
and
it
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
james
at
the
expense
of
the
county.
and
that
has
been
in
effect
for
quite
some
while
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
james
it's
done
--
automatically,
the
normal
record
is
prepared
in
a
capital
case.
in
addition
to
the
normal
record,
there
is
the
automatic
appeal
where
the
entire
record
of
the
proceedings
at
the
trial
court
has
prepared.
in
the
non-capital
case
as
such
as
this
one,
it's
the
normal
record,
unless
the
trial
court
authorizes
the
preparation
of
an
augmented
or
additional
record.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
that's
done
upon
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
regular
motion
in
the
trial
court.
and
as
a
result
to
that
motion
in
this
particular
case,
these
appellants
received,
in
addition
to
the
normal
clerk's
transcript,
a
transcript
of
the
clerk
containing
the
instructions
given
by
the
trial
court.
in
addition
thereto,
in
the
reporter's
transcript,
they
obtained
and
received
a
copy
of
the
boarder
examination,
the
jurors,
the
opening
statement
of
the
district
attorney
and
the
argument
of
the
district
attorney
to
the
jury.
so
obviously,
the
--
this
is
not
comparable
to
other
cases
where
access
to
in
a
court
of
an
appeal
is
foreclosed
indigent
defendant.
these
defendants,
these
petitioners
were
accorded
access
to
the
courts.
in
addition
to
that,
they
were
furnished
a
complete
transcript,
additional
transcript
from
the
normal
transcript
so
that
they
could
present
to
an
appellate
court
for
review
the
proceedings
in
the
lower
court.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
means
whereby
indigent
defendants
are
effectedly
--
are
effectively
granted
adequate
appellate
review.
and
so
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
has
been
a
denial
by
the
state
of
california
of
any
effective
appellate
review
to
indigent
defendants.
now,
as
to
the
preparation
of
a
record,
in
other
than
a
capital
case
in
california,
there
is
the
original
record
that
is
prepared
and
filed
with
the
district
court
of
appeal,
the
reviewing
court.
in
a
capital
case,
the
original
record
is
prepared
and
filed
with
the
supreme
court.
and
in
the
capital
case,
each
individual
appellant
receives
a
copy
of
the
transcript.
in
a
non-capital
case,
only
one
copy
to
a
side
is
prepared.
and
this
is
provided
for
in
rule
35
and
in
rule
10
of
the
rules
on
appeal.
and
it
provides
that
the
appealing
parties
or
their
counsel
can
make
arrangements
for
the
exchange
if
it's
required
of
the
transcript
of
the
party
for
the
preparation
of
any
documents
or
appeal
briefs.
and
--
mr.
william
e.
james
pardon?
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
recall
that
is
quoted
in
the
brief.
but
i
have
a
copy
of
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
rules
on
appeal
and
i'm
referring
to
rule
35.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
could
large
my
copy
of
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
rules.
they're
reported
in
50
cal.2nd
at
page
1
and
the
--
those
were
the
rules
on
appeal
in
effect
in
1959
when
these
proceedings
were
hand
in
the
trial
court.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
petitioner
meyes
who
received
a
copy
of
the
transcript
on
appeal
and
petitioner
douglas
complains
that
he
didn't
get
a
copy,
although
he
made
no
showing
of
why
any
effort
on
his
part,
if
he
made
an
effort,
to
obtain
the
copy
of
--
of
the
defendants.
the
record
on
appeal
was
not
hand
from
his
co-defendant,
his
co-appellant
who
--
with
whom
he
had
presented
a
joint
trial
strategy
in
the
trial
court
and
with
whom
he
presents
a
joint
appeal
in
this
court.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct.
meyes
was
in
folsom.
mr.
william
e.
james
about
approximately
119
and
120
miles
apart.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
correct.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
if
there
was
a
conflict,
they
had
great
difficulty
in
presenting
it
in
the
trial
court
as
we've
already
presented.
and
i
believe
on
this
appeal,
their
presentation
is
joint.
they
have
no
conflict.
and
as
it
will
be
evidence
from
the
brief
such
we
have
copies
of
here
were
filed
--
the
opening
brief
was
filed
presumably
by
--
prepared
by
petitioner
meyes.
but
it
indicated
that
it
was
also
on
behalf
of
petitioner
douglas
and
though
at
a
later
time,
he
--
douglas
attempted
to
renounce
the
filing
of
brief
on
his
behalf,
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
as
well
as
the
petition
for
hearing
in
the
supreme
court.
its
fair
by
meyes
on
behalf
of
himself
and
on
behalf
of
his
co-defendants
so
that
on
the
appeal
in
the
state
court,
there
was
this
joint
effort
and
these
petitioners
presented
their
matter
and
douglas
was
not
denied
any
effective
appellate
review.
now,
there
has
been
some
statement
made
by
counsel
today
that
what
he
--
you
need
is
an
advocate
apparently
not
only
at
the
trial
but
on
the
appellate
level.
well,
we
submit
that
on
the
appellate
level,
it's
the
review
and
that's
what
this
court
referred
to
in
--
in
griffin
versus
illinois
as
i
recall
that
it
was
affording
indigent
--
indigent
defendants
in
effective
appellate
review.
and
certainly,
an
effective
appellate
review
is
provided
when
there
is
a
record
prepared
and
file
with
the
district
court
of
appeal,
the
appellate
court.
the
review
is
in
the
appellate
court.
the
review
isn't
done
by
the
counsel
or
by
the
particular
individual
defendants.
mr.
william
e.
james
except
that
there
--
there,
you
had
a
trial.
and
there'd
be
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
here,
your
honor,
review
--
mr.
william
e.
james
and
the
review
was
made
by
an
appellate
court.
and
i
feel
that
the
judges
are
lawyers.
and
that
they
may
examine
a
record
and
as
they
did
in
this
case
and
this,
they
do
another
case
with
a
--
in
a
conscientious
manner,
“conscientious
to
a
fault”,
i
believe,
was
the
term
used
by
the
petitioners
herein.
when
there
is
a
conscientious
review
of
a
record
by
an
appellate
court,
we
submit
that
there
has
been
no
denial
to
a
petitioner
or
to
an
appellant
of
an
effective
appellate
review.
and
an
examination
of
these
briefs
will
disclose
that
there
is
a
full,
an
adequate
disposition
and
full
and
adequate
presentation
of
all
of
the
points.
and
in
addition,
we
have
here
in
this
case
a
full
and
adequate
review
by
the
district
court
of
appeal.
must
be
remembered
that
this
--
this
district
court
of
appeal
first
examine
the
record
to
make
a
determination
whether
there
should
be
appointment
of
counsel.
and
then
in
the
court
with
the
provisions
of
1241
and
also
the
rule
announced
in
people
versus
hyde
to
which
reference
has
been
made,
the
district
court
of
appeal
determined
on
a
basis
of
the
record
presented
to
it
and
it
would
serve
no
purpose
either
to
the
defendants
or
to
the
court
to
appoint
counsel.
and
as
a
consequence
and
as
they're
permitted
to
do,
they
denied
the
appointment
of
counsel.
and
we
submit
that
this
was
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
laws
to
these
particular
defendants
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
that
they
had
a
--
pardon
me.
mr.
william
e.
james
they
may
appear
by
counselor
in
person.
mr.
william
e.
james
but
--
mr.
william
e.
james
if
--
of
recent
years,
there
are
probably
been
a
closer
to
50-50
break
on
the
appearances
of
counsel
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
i
think
that
actually
what
we
are
looking
for
here
is
we
can't
get
equality
and
the
state
doesn't
require
to
make
everyone
equal.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
he
would
has
--
his
reputation
before
the
court
if
it
is
was
an
actual
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
frivolous
appeal
and
they've
probably
be
disposed
of
either
summarily
or
by
dismissal.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
in
these
cases,
the
district
courts
of
appeal
have
examined
the
record
and
they
write
opinions.
and
i
think
that
if
you
have
that
the
state
affords
an
effective
appellate
review
by
an
appellate
court
and
doesn't
discriminate
in
giving
that
review
as
to
those
who
are
in
(inaudible)
that
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
if
you'll
examine
the
briefs
in
this
particular
case,
you'll
find
that
these
are
well-prepared
briefs,
and
they're
well-document.
and
so
these
particular
appellants
did
get
an
opportunity
to
present
their
matters
to
the
appellate
court.
they
had
an
appellate
court
that
had
the
advantage
of
a
full
and
complete
record
before
it
to
make
its
review.
they
were
recorded
the
rights,
accorded
to
other
defendants
to
have
an
access
to
the
court
without
any
necessity
of
a
counsel.
mr.
william
e.
james
that
is
true.
but
is
it
a
requirement
of
due
process
that
a
state
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
afford
that
a
--
that
a
state
afford
to
an
indigent
defendant
--
mr.
william
e.
james
and
counsel
on
appeal
in
order
that
it
may
afford
to
that
appellant
equal
and
effective
appellate
review.
we
submit
that
there
was
effective
appellate
review
accorded
to
these
particular
petitioners.
and
they
were
denied
nothing
because
of
the
fact
that
were
indigent
because
the
state
furnished
them
with
the
means
of
getting
before
the
appellate
court
with
the
record
to
present
their
case
to
the
appellate
court
and
with
a
review
of
their
record
by
that
appellate
court
as
demonstrated
in
the
opinion.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
know
that
there
was
communication
as
to
these
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
petitioners.
mr.
william
e.
james
my
time
is
up.
mr.
william
e.
james
as
i
understand
the
record
doesn't
show
anything
except
that
there
were
briefs
filed
that
the
--
there
was
a
brief
on
behalf
of
the
appellants,
denominated
as
an
opening
brief
which
was
signed
by
meyes
and
also
contained
douglas'
signature
that
the
appellate
court
treated
the
matter
as
being
presented
to
it
jointly
by
these
particular
petitions.
mr.
william
e.
james
his
name
was
on
it.
it
was
prepared
by
meyes.
and
there
was
douglas'
name
on
the
brief.
mr.
william
e.
james
there
was
no
signature
except
meyes.
mr.
william
e.
james
no.
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
it
--
it
bears
the
address
of
--
of
petitioner
meyes,
as
i
recall.
and
i
believe
it
contains
his
signature,
the
opening
brief
as
well
as
the
reply
brief
and
the
re
--
rehear
petition
on
rehearing
and
also
the
petition
in
the
states
supreme
court.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
that
--
he
asked
i
believe
as
did
meyes
for
the
public
defender.
and
it
--
mr.
william
e.
james
of
course,
this
was
--
as
i
recall,
the
motion
was
considered
on
all
statutory
grounds
under
1181.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
think
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
this
was
all
a
part
of
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
this
was
all
part
of
the
trial
proceedings,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
trial
court
was
under
any
obligation
that
this
time
as
--
because
of
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
the
public
defender
had
been
specifically
dismissed.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
defendants
then
proceeded.
mr.
william
e.
james
it's
my
recollection
that
they
both
asked
for
the
appointment
of
the
public
defender
again.
and
of
course
that
was
the
only
lawyer
that
the
court
could
have
appointed
and
that's
the
lawyer
of
the
court
did
appoint
and
that's
the
lawyer
they
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
specifically
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
discharge.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
he
didn't
participate
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
he
didn't
participate
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
in
any
of
the
trial
after
the
voir
dire
of
the
jury.
so,
he
wouldn't
have
been
prepared
--
mr.
william
e.
james
i
would
have
to
refer
my
--
refer
to
that
portion
of
the
transcript
again.
it
is
my
recollection
that
there
had
been
references
to
this
possible
con
--
this
possible
conviction.
it
had
been
raised
in
the
voir
dire
of
the
jury
by
the
public
defender
anticipating
of
course
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no
except
that
--
of
course
one
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
as
i
recall
here,
one
of
the
police
officers
was
the
companion
or
fellow
officer
with
sergeant
nash
who
went
to
effect
the
arrest
of
these
particular
defendants.
and
it
was
at
this
time
that
douglas
made
the
particular
admissions
to
the
officer.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
believe
so.
it's
not
my
recollections.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
your
honor,
they
requested
in
the
court
as
it's
indicated
in
the
record
i
think
at
page
192
to
193,
which
is
a
copy
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
recites
the
proceedings
and
the
determination
made
by
the
presiding
justice
of
the
district
court
to
deny
the
counsel.
mr.
william
e.
james
on
the
appeal?
not
necessarily.
the
public
defender
under
the
statute
does
not
have
to
accept
these
appeals
and
particularly
would
not
where
he
did
not
try
the
matter.
and
in
this
case,
there
would
have
been
appointment
of
counsel
if
the
court
had
determined
there
was
going
to
be
any
merit
or
any
benefit
to
defendant
or
the
court
to
appoint
counsel
would
have
appointed
other
counsel.
mr.
william
e.
james
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
remaining
to
respond,
i
will
attempt
to
cover
the
counsel
on
appeal
point.
the
question
which
has
been
presented
in
essence
is,
“was
appointment
of
counsel
in
this
case
on
appeal
necessary
in
order
to
have
a
fair
and
meaningful
review?”
implicit,
we
feel
in
this
claim
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
is,
“does
the
california
appellate
procedure
discriminate
against
defendants
who
are
poor.”
we
submit
that
it
does
not
and
perhaps
in
order
to
apprise
the
court
of
just
what
happens
in
this
case
and
what
happens
in
all
cases
in
california
might
be
well
to
very
briefly
summarize
what
happens
in
a
capital
case
in
california
following
a
judgment
of
conviction.
appeal
is
not
automatic
in
california
except
in
capital
cases.
appeal
is
commenced
by
the
filing
of
a
written
notice
of
appeal
within
10
days
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
from
which
the
appeal
is
to
be
taken,
10
days
from
the
judgment
order
from
which
the
appeal
is
to
be
taken.
now,
this
is
commenced
without
the
filing
of
any
necessary
fee.
all
that
has
to
be
done
is
a
written
notice
of
appeal.
in
this
case,
there
were
two
handwritten
documents
which
were
denominated
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
william
e.
james
there's
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
william
e.
james
it's
not
automatic
unless
there
is
this
handwritten
notice
of
appeal
or
a
written
notice
of
appeal.
now,
upon
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal,
a
record
--
a
normal
record
on
appeal
is
commenced
to
be
prepared.
there's
nothing
further
to
be
done
in
order
to
prepare
a
normal
record,
and
this
comprises
the
clerk's
transcript
containing
the
pleadings,
the
minutes
of
the
court,
the
judgment
and
order
and
the
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
is
paid
for
by
the
state.
mr.
william
e.
james
regardless
of
whether
he
is
indigent
or
rich
--
mr.
william
e.
james
it
probably
benefits
more
the
defendant
of
limited
means
who
isn't
an
indigent
who
would
be
hard
pressed
if
he
wanted
to
challenge
his
conviction
to
pay
for
a
request.
mr.
william
e.
james
of
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
william
e.
james
--
of
the
court's
transcripts
and
a
reporter's
transcript
which
contains
the
oral
proceedings
at
the
trial
as
well
as
any
oral
proceedings
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
this
of
course
was
done
in
this
case.
there
is
provision
for
the
preparation
of
an
augmented
record
which
is
also
prepared
at
no
cost
to
the
defendant.
in
this
case,
the
particular
defendants
requested
an
augmented
record
and
got
it.
in
addition
to
the
normal
record,
a
reporter's
transcript
which
contained
the
voir
dire
of
the
jury,
a
reporter's
transcript
which
contained
the
arguments
of
the
district
attorney,
and
in
the
clerk's
transcript,
there
was
contained
the
instructions
given
to
the
jury
and
these
are
prepared
without
cost
to
the
defendants.
now,
upon
the
completion
and
preparation
of
this
transcript,
it
is
filed
with
the
district
court
of
appeal
which
has
jurisdiction
in
all
cases,
but
capital
cases
which
go
automatically
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
this
is
filed
without
any
cost.
and
there
is
placed
before
the
reviewing
court
a
transcript
of
the
trial
proceedings
and
this
happened
to
this
case
and
all
indigents
are
entitled
to
that.
now,
there
is
no
cost
to
the
defendants
and
obviously
there's
no
fee
for
the
filing
or
docketing
of
any
such
record.
california
recognizes
that
inappropriate
cases,
counsel
may
be
appointed
on
appeal.
now,
counsel
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
have
a
review.
a
defendant
whether
he's
indigent
or
wealthy
can
appear
himself
in
proper
person
and
argue
or
waive
arguments,
and
he
gets
a
review,
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
there
was
a
review
by
the
appellate
court
and
adjudication
as
to
the
merits
of
the
appeal.
and
we
submit
that
california's
procedure
in
regard
to
appeals
is
not
discriminating
against
indigent
defendants
and
did
not
discriminate
against
these
defendants.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
if
in
the
court
of
appeals,
if
he
requests
counsel
and
in
some
instances,
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
he
doesn't
have
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
there
may
be
a
number
of
instances
as
we
handle
quite
a
volume
of
appeals
in
pro
per.
frequently
defendants
do
not
request
the
appointment
of
the
counsel
and
in
prison
prepare
their
own
documents,
their
own
briefs
and
i'm
sure
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
prison
prepared
petitions
and
briefs.
mr.
william
e.
james
now,
if
he
does
want
counsel
and
if
he
does
request
the
counsel,
the
rule
in
california
which
we
submit
is
a
fair
ruling
in
accord
with
due
process
and
gives
to
a
defendant
a
fair
and
meaningful
review
of
these
proceedings
is
contained
in
people
versus
hyde
to
which
reference
has
been
made
in
the
briefs
on
file.
there,
the
supreme
court
laid
down
the
rule
which
has
been
followed
in
the
district
courts
of
appeals
since
1955
as
i
recall
it,
that
when
an
indigent
defendant
requests
the
appointment
of
counsel
on
appeal
to
represent
him,
the
court
has
two
alternatives;
it
may,
one,
appoint
counsel.
it
may
also
--
if
it
doesn't
appoint
counsel,
it
must
then
make
an
independent
examination
of
the
record
itself,
and
then
make
a
determination,
one,
would
appointment
of
counsel
be
of
advantage
to
the
defendants
or
helpful
to
the
courts.
and
if
it
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court
or
of
the
--
advantage
or
helpful
to
the
defendant,
appointment
of
counsel
is
made.
now,
if
it
determines
that
the
--
there
is
no
apparent
basis
under
this
rule
for
appointment
of
counsel,
counsel
is
not
appointed,
the
defendant
is
advised
that
he
may
file
his
own
briefs
or
--
and
in
this
--
as
in
this
case,
there
were
briefs
filed.
mr.
meyes
filed
a
brief.
the
first
opening
brief
was
signed
by
him,
post
marked
from
post
imprisonment
where
he
was
located.
it
purported
to
be
on
behalf
of
both
douglas
and
meyes.
a
reply
brief
was
filed.
it
was
a
well
prepared
brief.
somewhere
along
the
line,
appellant
douglas
tried
to
disown
mr.
meyes'
brief
and
claimed
that
he
wanted
to
file
his
own
brief.
no
brief
of
his
was
filed
and
on
the
petition
for
hearing
in
the
state
supreme
court
signed
by
the
defendant
petitioner
meyes
and
purported
beyond
behalf
of
meyes
as
well
as
upon
behalf
of
his
codefendant,
the
petitioner
douglas.
now,
there
has
been
some
contention
raised
that
douglas
did
not
get
a
copy
of
the
transcript.
the
original
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
opening
brief
was
filed
and
as
it
was
indicated
on
behalf
of
both
douglas
and
meyes
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
a
respondent's
brief
prepared
by
mr.
goertzen,
my
associate
here,
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
and
a
reply
brief
was
filed
by
bennie
meyes.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
court
then
scheduled
it
for
oral
argument.
the
argument
was
waived
although
at
oral
argument
by
--
mr.
william
e.
james
waived
by
the
respondent,
the
attorney
general.
mr.
william
e.
james
however,
at
that
time
as
i
recall,
cite
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
the
very
recent
case
of
people
versus
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
james
no.
mr.
william
e.
james
just
proceeded
on
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
on
the
briefs
on
file.
mr.
william
e.
james
oral
argument
isn't
a
requirement
in
order
to
have
a
review
of
any
conviction
in
california
on
appeal.
it
is
provided
for.
mr.
william
e.
james
if
the
man
had
a
paid
attorney?
mr.
william
e.
james
the
court
would
undoubtedly
in
that
case
hear
only
the
attorney
and
not
--
mr.
william
e.
james
but
they
would
hear
the
attorney
if
he
could
--
mr.
william
e.
james
ordinarily
not
unless,
of
course,
if
you
were
incarcerated
and
in
proper
person
unless
there
was
an
order
of
the
court
bringing
him
down
to
orally
argued
or
if
you
were
at
large
on
bail,
he
could
argue
in
person.
mr.
william
e.
james
they'd
ordinarily
do
not,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
however,
as
i
point
out,
oral
argument
isn't
the
requirement
in
order
to
have
a
review
and
it
is
not
regarded
as
highly
as
oral
argument
is
in
this
court.
and
frequently,
on
the
calendars
in
the
district
courts
of
appeal,
a
high
percentage
of
the
criminal
matters
are
submitted
without
oral
argument
and
frequently
without
appearance
on
behalf
of
appellant's
attorneys.
so
it's
not
a
requirement
in
order
to
have
a
review.
we
submit
that
the
requirements
of
due
process
are
that
there'd
be
a
fair
and
meaningful
hearing
or
review
by
an
appellate
court,
and
we
submit
that
it
was
had
in
this
case
and
that
it's
had
in
all
cases
in
california
whether
the
appellant,
the
indigent,
or
wealthy
or
a
person
of
means.
mr.
william
e.
james
it
didn't
prevent
them
from
having
a
review
by
the
appellate
court
of
the
trial
(voice
overlap)
district
court.
mr.
william
e.
james
well
the
court
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
considered
the
points
that
were
raised
and
it
reviewed
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
we
don't
make
any
point.
mr.
william
e.
james
in
fact,
the
appellate
court
in
this
case
as
to
appellant,
meyes
--
petitioner
meyes,
gave
him
the
advantage
of
section
669,
as
i
recall,
which
prevented
sentences
running
consecutively
to
a
life
sentence
which
modifies
the
judgment
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
if
my
recollection
is
correct.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
james
on
the
petition
for
hearing,
they
had
the
briefs
filed
there
before
them.
there
was
a
very
well
prepared
petition
which
was
filed
by
defendant
meyes
--
mr.
william
e.
james
he
purported
to
be
on
behalf
of
himself
and
on
behalf
of
douglas.
i
have
a
copy
of
that
which
we
would
lodge
with
the
court.
mr.
william
e.
james
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
continue
just
for
a
few
minutes
and
if
i
may,
mr.
goertzen
would
like
to
make
one
remark
touching
on
the
question
which
your
honor
asked
prior
to
the
lunch
hour.
mr.
william
e.
james
as
i
was
stating
california,
we
contend
that
the
procedure
adopted
by
statute
and
by
court
decision
to
handle
appeals
is
not
discriminating
against
indigents
but
accords
to
them
a
fair
and
meaningful
review
of
their
trial
conviction.
and
even
in
cases
where
briefs
are
not
filed
by
indigents
who
have
previously
requested
of
appointment
of
counsel,
the
appellate
courts
in
california
have
gone
ahead
and
reviewed
the
record
and
rendered
a
written
opinion
in
regard
to
the
matter.
now,
there
were
some
remarks
made
at
the
argument
last
time
that
judges
aren't
lawyers.
well
we
don't
subscribe
to
that.
we
feel
that
this
review
had
by
the
justices
of
the
appellate
court
which
is
different
than
a
review
had
by
the
trial
judge
as
to
the
question
of
whether
he
should
allow
an
appeal
from
his
particular
rulings
and
the
like.
this
is
the
review
made
by
judges
who
are
experienced
on
the
appellate
courts
and
we
feel
that
they
can
certainly
make
a
determination
whether
appointment
of
counsel
should
be
made
and
where
it
would
aid
the
defendant
or
aid
the
court
to
appoint
counsel
and
were
not
to
go
ahead
and
review
the
record
as
they
do
in
california.
certainly,
there
isn't
an
unlimited
supply
of
qualified
lawyers
to
appoint
in
every
case
and
the
courts
certainly
can
make
discrimination.
i'm
sure
this
court
has
encountered
the
problem
many
times
when
there
are
petitions
for
certiorari
by
indigent
defendants
who
have
or
appealing
from
convictions
in
federal
courts.
certainly,
this
court
can
make
appointment
to
counsel
in
every
case
and
we
certainly
feel
that
the
state
procedure
here
does
not
discriminate
against
indigents
but
it
accords
them
the
rights
to
which
they're
entitled.
pardon
me.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
one
or
two
of
the
divisions
of
the
second
appellate
district
has
panel,
i
believe,
of
the
l.a.
bar
association
to
which
they
make
reference
and
obtain
recommendations.
however,
they
still
have
to
make
an
independent
investigation
themselves
of
the
transcript
to
determine
whether
appointment
should
be
made
under
the
rule
of
the
supreme
court
in
people
versus
hyde,
and
they
do
that,
however,
they
are
aided
by
the
panel
of
lawyers
and
volunteers
to
examine
records.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
recall.
there
is
a
footnote
to
the
main
opinion
where
the
presiding
justice
did
refer
to
the
procedure
they
used.
he
pointed
out
that
there
had
been
an
independent
investigation
made
by
the
court.
it's
my
recollection
that
there
was
a
reference
to
the
l.a.
bar
association
also.
but
i
know
that
the
presiding
judge
and
the
court
reviewed
the
record
initially
in
this
case
to
make
the
determination
whether
it
aids
the
defendants
or
the
court
to
appoint
counsel.
now,
at
this
time,
i
will
reserve
a
minute
for
mr.
goertzen.
we
have
made
an
offer
to
lodge
with
this
court
if
the
court
desires
the
briefs
filed
by
these
petitioners
in
the
california
court
as
well
as
the
brief
filed
by
respondent
and
the
petition
for
hearing
if
the
court
desires.
mr.
william
e.
james
as
far
as
you're
talking
about
review
the
record?
mr.
william
e.
james
we've
checked
the
13
transcripts
very
hurriedly.
just
briefly,
i
believe
that
mr.
douglas
testified
as
far
as
the
facts
of
the
murder
were
concerned
when
they
heard
the
man
coming
down
the
room.
he
lay
down
on
the
floor
and
put
his
hands
over
his
head
and
didn't
see
anything
although
he
heard
shots
and
this
was
corroborated
by
mr.
meyes.
mr.
william
e.
james
as
far
as
the
robberies
were
concerned,
both
defendants
made
denials.
i
might
mention
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
douglas'
gun
that
meyes
had
fired.
mr.
william
e.
james
and
the
conflict
which
probably
does
not
show
in
the
record
as
far
as
the
murder
trial
was
concerned
was
apparently,
as
mr.
mitchelson
might
explain
to
you
if
you
want,
is
the
fact
that
these
people
were
very
bitter
at
one
another
during
the
trial
especially
with
reference
to
this
alleged
charge
by
douglas
to
meyes
that
“you
did
it,
don't
hang
it
on
me
and."
mr.
william
e.
james
this
is
at
page
--
mr.
william
e.
james
at
the
murder
trial,
page
2170,
mr.
mitchelson
is
cross-examining
mr.
meyes
and
with
regard
to
the
murder
--
the
meeting
at
the
hospital
after
the
act
and
he
says,
“now,
do
you
recall
--
actually
startled
when
you
saw
bill
douglas?”
and
he
answers,
“yes,
i
was
surprised.”
now,
the
reason
he
was
surprised
was
because
the
police
had
informed
him
that
bill
douglas
was
dead,
and
he
was
going
to
take
the
rap.
and
he
says,
“do
you
recall
being
somewhat
hostile
towards
bill
of
that
meeting?”
answer,
“yes.”
“what
was
the
reason
for
that?”
then
there
was
an
objection
by
the
prosecution
attorney
which
is
sustained
by
the
court
as
to
his
reason
for
being
hostile
so
that
it
was
never
brought
out,
but
as
indicated
in
the
appeal
of
the
exact
wording
of
what
--
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
that
was
read
to
you?
mr.
william
e.
james
it
was
in
the
record.
it
was
somewhere
back
in
the
record.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
this
is
the
state
--
mr.
william
e.
james
this
is
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
relating
the
conversation
held
between
meyes
and
douglas
at
the
hospital,
and
he
said
that
douglas
told
him
that
--
or
douglas
said
to
meyes,
“don't
hang
it
on
me,
you're
not
going
to
--
you
fired
the
trigger
and
i
don't
--
i'm
not
going
to
be
this
--
take
the
rap
for
you.”
then
the
police
officer
of
course
--
the
two
defendants
as
i
recall
denied
that
they
had
made
any
statement.
certainly,
meyes
did
in
the
record,
denied
that
he
--
that
was
said
by
douglas.
mr.
william
e.
james
he
did
--
meyes
denied
that
that
was
said
to
him
by
douglas.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
remember
that
douglas
denied
--
he
made
the
statement.
mr.
william
e.
james
perhaps,
i
could
perhaps
speak
myself
for
moment.
douglas,
they
never
denied
those
statements
were
made.
in
the
beginning,
the
police
were
trying
to
play
one
against
the
other
so
they
brought
them
together
and
these
all
came
out
in
every
bit
of
this
in
the
record.
that's
precisely
the
point
i
think
you're
asking.
it
is
in
the
record.
they
brought
them
together
and
then
they
started
fighting
amongst
themselves,
because
one
had
told
meyes
that
douglas
had
died
so
when
meyes
saw
douglas,
he
said,
well,
what
are
you
trying
to
do
to
me?
so
they
started
accusing
each
other
and
every
bit
of
that
is
in
the
record.
and
therefore,
in
answer
to
your
question,
there
certainly
was
a
conflict.
you
see,
douglas'
theory
of
defense
was
simply
that
he
was
shot
and
he
was
in
a
corner
and
he
doesn't
know
what
happened.
now,
meyes
finally
admitted
that
he
did
do
the
shooting
and
he
used
the
self-defense
theory.
you
cannot
say
if
they're
not
in
conflict
with
one
another
just
because
they
have
entirely
different
theories.
douglas
in
no
way
supports
meyes'
theory
because
douglas
says
i
was
shot
and
i
was
practically
dead
and
i'm
in
the
corner.
i
don't
know
what
happened.
if
you
mean
that
he
actually
knocked
into
the
trial,
he
did
not
do
that,
but
there
was
that
conflict
--
mr.
william
e.
james
thank
you,
your
honor.
