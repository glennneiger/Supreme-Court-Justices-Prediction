mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
mr.
goertzen
first,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
honorable
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i'll
address
myself
to
the
points
of
the
trial
error
and
mr.
james
will
reserve
argument
on
the
right
to
counsel
on
appeal
as
a
part
of
due
process.
now,
mr.
--
mr.
marks
and
mitchelson
collectively
have
talked
at
great
length
on
the
preparation
and
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
black
comment
on
this
preparation,
so
i'd
like
to
turn
to
that
first
off.
california
has
penal
code
1050
which
states
the
over
--
overall
philosophy
i
think
of
many
states
that
these
people
of
the
state
of
california
are
all
interested
in
speedy
trials
and
criminal
cases
and
for
continuance.
the
judge
will
not
allow
a
continuance
unless
there
is
affirmative
proof
of
cause
and
on
reasonable
notice.
now,
we
turn
to
this
case
where
the
first
notice
of
the
continuance
was
on
the
very
day
of
trial.
and
frequently,
both
counsels
can
vouch
for
this.
defense
counsel,
when
they
-
when
they
know
they're
going
to
hit
for
a
trial
unprepared,
if
they
are,
and
really
in
good
faith,
continue
it,
they
can
advance
the
cause
on
the
calendar
and
so
move
if
that
was
done
in
the
kirkwood
(ph)
case
cited
by
mr.
--
mr.
marks
in
his
brief.
now,
let's
look
to
the
actual
preparation.
was
atkins
himself
prepared
or
did
he
feel
himself
prepared?
well,
i
think
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
that
when
counsel
is
--
desires
to
put
off
a
case
a
little
bit,
he
--
he
can
tend
to
try
to
bluff
the
judge
so
to
speak
and
--
and
advance
reasons
here
and
there.
and
the
judge
is
on
the
burden,
the
trial
judge
of
making
a
decision,
well,
does
he
really
have
good
reason
for
continuance?
and
it
submitted
that
judge
rhone
did
put
into
this
test.
and
the
only
reason
that
is
in
this
record
for
the
desire
on
the
part
of
mr.
atkins
for
continuance
was
so
that
he
could
cross
index
those
prior
trail
records
and
preliminary
to
the
instant
case.
and
i'd
--
i'll
have
more
to
say
about
those
records
in
a
minute.
in
support
of
this,
at
pages
75
and
76
of
the
record,
i
wrote
this
out
so
i
don't
know
exactly
what
--
starting
at
the
bottom
four
lines,
“i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
through
no
fall
on
my
own
to
prepare
this
case
in
the
manner
which
i
would
like
to
be
prepared."
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
starting
at
page
75
bottom
four
lines,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
“i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
through
no
fall
on
my
own
to
prepare
this
case
in
the
manner
in
which
i
would
like
to
be
prepared.
i
have
at
this
point
not
have
the
opportunity
to
cross
index
all
of
two
trials
and
one
preliminary
transcript
of
all
the
witnesses
who
will
appear
in
this
trial.
for
that
reason,
i
feel
i
would
like
to
be
better
prepared
than
i
am
now.”
now,
let's
look
at
those
transcripts
and
look
at
that
reason.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
oh,
right.
well,
this
brings
up
another
point,
your
honor.
he
said
that
--
in
other
words,
there
was
an
illusion
made
by
mr.
marks
in
the
record
that
he
felt
that
he
could
prepare
as
he
went
along
the
whole
trial.
that's
not
true
at
all.
he
felt
that
as
the
trail
progressed,
he
could
cross
index.
he
could
sit
there
and
pull
the
record
of
the
--
the
witnesses
testifying.
and
as
your
honors
know,
trial
judges
frequently
after
a
witness
has
testified
on
direct,
allow
5,
10-minute
break.
the
--
a
lot
of
times,
they
take
their
recesses
right
then
in
there
and
that's
when
counsel
usually
orients
his
--
impeaching
testimony
if
any
there
be.
but
we'll
--
we'll
get
to
that
point
also
on
whether
or
not
mr.
atkins
should
have
or
was
actually
prepared
on
that
--
on
those
prior
records.
mr.
--
getting
back
to
mr.
atkins'
statements,
true,
he
made
various
equivocal
statements
about
the
preparation.
but
at
page
81,
when
they
had
already
dismissed
unqualifiedly
the
public
defender,
mr.
atkins
was
under
no
more
pressure
so
to
speak
that
was
supplied
if
you
please
by
the
defendants
themselves.
and
he
said
at
page
81,
after
mr.
carr,
the
prosecutor,
offered
or
offered
a
thought,
why
not,
the
trial
judge
says
they
dismissed
mr.
atkins,
why
not,
he
asked
the
trial
judge,
appoint
mr.
atkins
in
an
advisory
capacity
which
had
been
done
in
a
prior
case,
the
chessman
case.
and
mr.
atkins
was
not
happy
about
this
thought.
he
was
under
no
pressure
so
to
speak
by
anybody
really
at
this
time.
he
said,
at
page
81,
mr.
atkins'
last
speech
at
the
bottom,
“your
honor.
i
oppose
that
motion.
i
do
so
for
this
reason.
if
these
defendants
want
an
attorney
to
represent
them,
i
am
here
qualified
and
ready
to
try
their
case
for
them.”
a
little
further
down,
the
bottom
three
lines,
they
have
an
opportunity
to
get
an
attorney
who,
and
my
humble
estimation,
is
equal
to
the
task.”
he
of
course
was
speaking
of
himself.
i
referred
in
my
brief
to
several
of
the
--
of
the
or
other
quotes
that
i've
been
going
into.
also,
at
page
70
--
page
75
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
think
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
they
first
had
a
motion
--
they
--
they
first
had
an
affidavit
under
170.6.
that
was
the
very
first
order
of
business.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right,
against
the
trial
judge.
the
second,
that
was
the
time
they
filed,
the
second
one
was
the
motion
for
continuance
for
more
time
to
investigate
the
alibi
witnesses.
then
the
third
--
the
third
motion
was
the
conflict.
the
conflict
was
not
developed
fully
at
that
time
or
the
argument.
they
went
back
to
the
170.6.
i
think
mr.
atkins
voir
dire
the
jury,
let's
see,
i
think
at
page
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
oh,
mr.
--
yes,
mr.
douglas,
at
page
37
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
okay,
right,
that's
true
but
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
that's
right.
they
started
--
they
started
opposing
the
--
the
objection
right
away.
i
didn't
mean
to
mislead
you.
mr.
atkins
was
in
fact
kept
on
until
after
voir
dire.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
about
page
77
but
as
we'll
develop,
your
honor,
there
was
absolutely
no
reason
for
them
to
discharge
this
man.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
that
--
at
page
30
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
but
i
think
as
i
develop
my
argument
both
on
the
risk
of
preparation
and
on
conflict,
your
honors,
they
weren't
entitled
to
dismiss
this
man.
also,
recall
this.
this
man
had
been
--
first
of
all
is
in
the
state
attorney
general's
office
and
district
attorney's
offices
and
--
and
lot
of
public
offices,
a
deputy
--
when
they
say
the
public
defender,
the
deputy
speaks
as
a
pubic
defender.
when
they
appoint
the
public
defender's
office
or
when
the
attorney
general's
office
comes
in
on
a
case,
the
deputy
handle
that
speaks
at
that
person.
now,
the
public
defender
was
appointed
in
august
18,
no
objection.
august
21st,
they
were
back
in
court
for
arraignment,
no
objection.
september
30,
there
had
been
no
advancement
of
the
cause
or
attempt
to
advance
the
cause
for
trial
to
raise
any
objections.
they
come
walking
in
and
hit
--
hit
the
judge
with
these
motions.
now,
another
thing
i'd
like
to
bring
up
at
this
time,
your
honors,
it
was
alluded
to
in
the
briefs
and
this
is
more
or
less
a
good
faith
offer
of
proof.
we
found
out
after
our
briefs
which
maybe
a
confession
of
some
negligence
on
our
part,
we
found
out
that
--
that
mr.
carr,
the
prosecutor,
had
a
copy
of
the
preliminary.
that
preliminary
i
--
i
brought
along.
we
are
prepared
the
logic
with
the
court.
that
shows
that
on
august
34th,
prior
to
the
18th,
they
were
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
at
august
34th
of
1959
prior
to
the
18th,
they
had
the
preliminary
hearing.
every
one
of
these
witnesses
was
called.
the
public
defender
represented
both
of
them.
it
was
a
227
page
document.
141
pages
as
cross-examination
of
every
--
any
possible
kind
you
could
want.
they
--
he
did
everything
in
his
power
to
impeach
the
witnesses
etcetera.
and
then
the
--
the
information
was
filed
on
august
11th
and
then
on
august
18th,
they
had
the
formal
appointment
of
the
public
defender.
but
the
--
the
public
defender's
office
was
not
new
to
this
case.
also
recall
the
public
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
that
was
a
public
defender
by
the
name
of
salter,
also
from
the
same
office.
also
recall
this
mr.
justice
black
that
the
public
defender's
office
was
not
strange
to
this
case
because
mr.
brackenridge,
defended
meyes
throughout
the
two
murder
cases
on
court
appointment
and
he's
from
the
very
same
office.
now,
let's
turn
to
the
murder
case.
this
has
been
brought
up
in
--
in
counsel's
briefs.
and
there
was
much
made
of
these
voluminous
transcripts
of
the
murder
case.
the
murder
case,
i
handled
the
appeal
from
the
attorney
general's
office
on
a
murder
case
and
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
--
of
mr.
marks'
brief,
a
hearing
was
still
open.
and
hearing
has
since
been
denied
in
that.
there
was
3819
page
document.
now,
of
that
document
or
of
that
transcript,
267
pages
dealt
with
these
robbery
witnesses,
evidence
of
11
of
the
13
counts
in
the
instant
case
were
submitted.
now,
mr.
mitchelson
has
stated
there
was
no
reason
to
cross-exam
or
there
was
no
reason
to
really
get
worked
up
and
find
alibis
for
those
particular
witnesses
at
that
time,
it's
only
at
this
time.
however,
your
honor,
the
only
theory
of
the
prosecution
in
that
murder
case
of
that
police
officer
was
that
these
defendants
knew
they
were
being
--
they
were
being
sought
after
for
the
--
for
the
--
being
sought
after
for
these
instant
robberies
in
this
case.
and
that
when
the
officers
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
apartment,
the
--
the
defendants
ran
into
the
room,
hit
out
and
when
the
officer
walked
in,
they
shot
him
and
killed
him.
now,
i
submit
that
mr.
mitchelson
would
be
acknowledging
negligence
on
his
part
as
a
practitioner.
if
he
didn't
hammer
out
every
possible
alibi
he
could
for
those
robberies
where
that's
the
sole
theory
of
--
of
the
prosecution
eminent.
and
i
submit
that
mr.
mitchelson
did
a
whale
of
a
job
in
cross-examining
these
witnesses,
bringing
out
the
fact,
their
-
their
bookmakers
and
their
--
their
inability
to
or
their
perceptive
ability
to
identify.
much
the
same
thing
as
mr.
salter
did
at
the
preliminary
hearing
later
on
the
robberies
themselves.
there
was
every
motive
to
develop
every
possible
thing
they
could
at
those
murder
trials
to
--
to
exploit
those
robberies.
they
did
offer
one
alibi
witness
for
douglas.
and
meyes
categorically
deny
involvement
and
he
--
he
handled
his
alibi
via
his
own
testimony
by
stating
that
he
had
jobs
at
those
times,
his
working
nights.
that
would
have
conflicted
with
the
possibility
of
committing
those
robberies.
he
offered
no
outside
alibi
witnesses.
but
there
was
time,
there
was
--
there
was
ample
warning
of
--
of
or
ample
identification
of
the
type
of
offenses
that
might
later
have
been
lodged
and
which
were
lodged.
and
the
public
defender's
office,
having
been
in
all
stages
of
this
case
prior
to
the
instant
case
and
being
one
office,
these
transcripts
were
available.
and
as
i
say,
there
was
only
267
pages
of
that
3800
page
document
that
were
really
material.
now,
mr.
marks
in
his
argument
stated
--
he
argued
--
now,
the
first
two
trials
were
murder
case.
the
robberies
were
really
subsidiary
to
a
murder.
mr.
mitchelson
expand
--
expand
on
this
theme
also.
now,
we're
saying
this,
the
murder
or
the
bulk
of
that
3800
page
document
is
subsidiary
to
the
robberies.
see,
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
and
all
mr.
atkins
really
had
to
be
familiar
with
was
that
267
pages
plus
a
short
preliminary
transcript
and
he
was
ready
for
trial
on
the
robberies
because
that's
all
it
was
charged.
now,
mr.
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe,
asked
mr.
marks
if
it
was
not
a
fact
that
--
that
these
defendants
had
dismissed
the
public
defender,
it
was
true.
and
that
time,
mr.
marks
in
his
--
in
his
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
"all
they
really
wanted
was
a
continuance.
they
weren't
asking
for
much
a
week
try
to
get
another
--
another
counsel.”
right,
so
the
counsel
could
be
prepared
was
one
of
the
other
things.
at
page
78,
mr.
atkins'
last
speech
at
the
bottom
of
that
page,
“well,
now,
suppose
that
this
case
were
continued
until
monday”,
recalling
this
is
september
30th,
a
wednesday
prior
to
that
monday,
“and
i
had
that
much
time
to
prepare,
would
you
still
desire
to
have
me
relieved
as
your
counsel?”
defendant
meyes,
“yes,
mr.
atkins.”
and
he
went
on
to
say,
"well,
if
he
can
have
his
own
counsel,
he'd
be
satisfied."
there
was
no
indication
in
this
record
that
these
men
in
really
good
faith
felt
atkins
wasn't
prepared.
at
page
77
also,
your
honors,
mr.
atkins
ex
--
expressly
denied
that
he
ever
told
these
defendants
he
wasn't
prepared
or
told
him
that
he
hadn't
read
the
transcripts
for
which
they
were
basing
all
their
complaining
about.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
meyes,
i
believe,
was
about
20,
21
or
2
at
the
time
of
trial
and
i
mean
douglas
was
22
or
3
at
the
time
of
trial
and
meyes
was
34.
and
education-wise,
douglas
had
gone
through
the
11th
grade
and
meyes
had
gone
through
--
he's
finished
high
school
in
the
marines
and
--
and
came
back
and
had
a
year
and
half
with
l.a.
state
college
of
social
sciences.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
the
bulk
of
the
evidence
was
in
the
murder
itself.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well,
the
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
--
the
defendants
offered
no
evidence
at
all
in
the
--
in
this
robbery
trial,
the
instant
case.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
at
the
murder
trial,
the
witnesses
were
thoroughly
cross-examined.
and
i
might
say
in
--
at
that
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
on
the
robberies?
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
oh,
both
the
--
both
defendants
took
the
stand
and
testified
at
great
length
in
the
--
in
the
murder
case.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
oh,
i'd
--
i
would
say
this
that
i
think
mr.
mitchelson
can
vouch
for
that
that
both
meyes
and
douglas
testified
at
very
great
length
in
the
--
in
the
murder
trial.
they
were
on
the
stand
quite
a
while.
i
think
he
can
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
oh,
i
didn't
know
that
myself.
i
thought
the
second
trial
took
12
weeks.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
no,
your
honor,
i
submit
this.
in
the
two
murder
cases,
recall,
they're
trying
them
for
murder.
there
was
no
count
as
to
the
robbery.
the
murders
were
being
offered
solely
as
or
the
robberies
were
being
offered
solely
as
motive.
and
therefore,
i
think
if
you
--
if
you
--
in
other
words,
if
you
divorce
the
robbery
try
--
the
robbery
testimony
from
the
two
murder
cases,
you
would
have
transcripts
about
as
long
as
the
instant
case
if
--
if
the
defendants
say
had
testified
at
the
--
in
the
instant
case.
in
other
words,
the
robbery
--
the
--
the
actual
physical
length
of
the
robbery
testimony
in
--
in
the
--
offered
in
the
two
murder
cases
is
very
short.
the
murders
of
course
took
--
took
a
great
deal
of
length
because
as
i
say,
there
were
--
there
were
numerous
confessions,
there
were
all
kinds
of
post-arrest
activities
that
were
--
that
came
into
focus.
the
robberies
were
offered
solely
for
that
motive
purpose.
and
if
you
laid,
i
--
i
would
offer
that
if
you
lay
the
--
the
--
extracted
the
robbery
testimony
from
the
two
murder
trials
separately
in
the
preliminary
and
assuming
meyes
and
douglas
had
both
testified
unless
you'd
probably
have
about
four
equal
transcripts.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
and
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well,
of
course
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
oh,
yes,
you're
definitely
right.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
after
they
got
rid
of
atkins
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right,
they
didn't
do
a
thing.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
they
didn't
do
a
thing.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
absolutely
nothing.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
and
they
did
absolutely
nothing,
nothing.
and
our
--
our
whole
basic
contention
is
they
had
no
right
to
dismiss
that
public
defender.
and
i
submit
that
--
that
the
--
the
citations
in
the
record
that
i
have
given
your
honors,
adequately
support
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
yes,
the
three
days
include
everything.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
believe
that
took
a
day,
maybe,
there
is
a
--
a
trial
day,
let's
say.
now,
i
like
to
say
this
in
respect
to
your
questions
or
your
com
--
comments,
mr.
justice
brennan.
these
men
were
inarticulate
defendants.
i
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
--
submit
you
read
that
record
and
patently
these
men
might
be
able
to
get
--
there
were
just
kind
of
show,
a
t
least
amaze.
he
used
some
pretty,
pretty
large
words
there.
and
he
--
he
knew
what
--what
he
was
doing,
i
submit.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
no,
i
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
--
if
judge
rhone
was
right
in
insisting,
they
had
no
grounds
for
continuance,
insisting
they
had
no
right
to
separate
counsel
or
--
or
stop
the
trial
and
get
new
counsel.
then
judge
rhone
had
no
other
course.
he
said
that
they
were
adequately
warned.
i
submit
that
at
or
about
page
77
through
81,
judge
rhone
impressed
upon
them,
their
counsel
took
them
into
lock-up
and
impressed
upon
them.
the
counsel
set
for
the
record,
“i
implore
these
men
not
to
go
to
trial.
it
--
it'll
be
a
parse
or
it
would
be
a
parse.”
we're
not
saying
these
men
are
lawyers
by
any
stretch.
although,
mr.
james
may
have
some
proof
for
that
when
he
offers
the
briefs
they
filed.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
they
didn't
decline
to
take
him.
they
took
him
on
august
18th.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
at
the
day
of
trial,
that's
when
they
started
to
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
that's
about
the
complexion
of
things.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
no,
they
didn't.
every
time
they
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
every
time
our
witness
was
finished,
they
jump
off
and
yell
they
wanted
counsel
and
that
they
were
being
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well,
he
had
this
in
the
record,
your
honor.
he
had
mr.
atkins
represent
at
page
36
at
the
behalf
of
mr.
douglas.
oh,
at
page
--
yes,
page
36,
mr.
atkins
stated,
“your
honor,
on
behalf
of
mr.
douglas,
he
has
asked
me
to
make
a
motion
for
a
continuance
so
that
he
may
retain
the
attorney,
which
he
talked
to,
whose
name
is
leo
brennan
and
has
made
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
brennan.
i'm
sorry.
we
found
out
later
that
that
should
have
been
an
a,
sir.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
leo
brennan.
and
has
made
arrangements
to
have
him
come
in
and
defend
him.
and
he
wishes
me
to
bring
that
up
and
bring
that
to
your
honors'
attention.
he
has
been
in
touch
with
leo
brennan
and
has
made
arrangements
to
have
leo
brennan
defend
him.
now,
i
submit
that
if
--
if
on
that
basis,
i
--
i
wou
--
would
go
along
with
you,
justice
black,
at
that
time
or
--
or
later
on.
he
should
have
said,
“well,
maybe
this
guy
did
have
brennan.”
but
later
on
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
no,
i
--
i'd
like
to
clear
that
up.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
finishing
that
other
--
just
that
one
other
item.
i
was
going
to
say
that
later
on,
douglas
stated
he
had
talked
to
brennan
on
the
phone
and
that
brennan
had
promised
to
come
in
and
see
him.
in
other
words,
you
can
glean
from
the
record
that
there
was
no
actual
arrangement
of
any
representation
for
douglas
at
all.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
think
we
can
believe
that
but,
your
honor
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
i'm
submitting
that
there's
--
there's
numerous
state
cases.
i
don't
know
what
the
--
the
federal
--
i
don't
think
there's
a
federal
case
on
course
with
these.
but
there's
numerous
state
cases
in
california
by
our
supreme
court
that
say,
“a
man
doesn't
have
a
right
to
come
into
court
and
change
counsel
in
a
middle
of
a
trial
or
at
the
beginning
of
a
trial
where
witnesses
have
been
subpoenaed
and
--
and
things
are
all
set
to
go.
if
there
hasn't
been
a
good
showing
or
--
or
there
is
an
adequate
reason
to
dismiss
this
counsel,
there
is
an
adequate
reason
for
preparation.”
i
submit
that
--
that
judge
rhone
obeyed
the
state
penal
code
in
--
in
this
case
by
going
ahead
in
the
manner
he
did.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
now,
on
--
on
relation
to
that
motion,
mr.
--
mr.
marks
stated
that
apparently,
this
is
some
reflection
on
his
--
on
--
on
atkins'
preparation.
well,
first
of
all,
i
answered
your
question.
i
don't
think
that
the
evidence
that
they
wanted
to
exercise
a
preparatory
challenge
in
and
off
itself
supports
any
legal
reason
that,
any
legal
reasoning
so
to
speak
or
--
or
law
that
--
that
judge
rhone
was
--
was
unfair
with
them.
i
really
don't.
they
--
in
other
words,
they
knew
rhone
advanced
through
the
--
the
first
mistrial
murder
case
with
them.
and
they
--
they
had
reason,
apparently,
from
that
that
they
wanted
to
dismiss
him
on
the
other
hand
after
--
once
they
have
--
understand
this
that
170.6
is
a
preparatory
challenge.
you
can
do
that,
period.
you
don't
have
to
have
any
cause.
170
in
california
penal
code
is
still
in
effect
for
cause.
you
can
dismiss
the
judge.
anytime
you
--
you
can
show
cause.
now,
apparently,
there
was
no
great
discrepancy
between
this
man
and
judge
rhone
or
they
or
having
laws
on
170.6.
mr.
atkins
would
have
turned
around
and
try
the
170
and
--
and
spell
out
to
the
court.
the
difference
that
to
me
is
in
170.6,
you
don't
have
to
allege
any
reason
at
all.
you
can
just
orally
state,
“i
--
i
don't
want
you.”
on
the
other
hand,
on
170,
you
have
to
tell
a
court
why
you
don't
want
him
to
sit,
why
you
think
he
is
prejudice.
now,
atkins
apparently
didn't
have
any
reasons
for
that
because
he
at
least
didn't
advance
him.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
on
a
continuance
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
yes,
sir.
i
think
you'll
find
it
--
well,
this
matter
has
been
on
the
calendar
before.
and
there
had
been
three
continuances
before
and
then
he
corrects
himself,
three
motions
for
continuance
before.
i
can
adhere
these
matters
piecemeal,
a
motion
is
denied.
in
other
words,
at
this
time,
atkins
came
back
with
a
suggestion
that
he
had
leo
brennan
and
--
and
that
--
that
morning
already
judge
rhone,
who
by
this
time
was
probably
getting
a
little
hurried,
had
heard
three
other
mixed
motions
for
continuance
on
various
grounds
including
douglas'
mother
illness
and
--
and
things
like
that.
he
meant
that
morning.
there'd
been
three
motions
for
continuance.
there
had
not
been
any
continuances.
now,
i
think,
unless
your
honors
have
other
questions
on
the
preparation
point,
i
might
turn
to
the
conflicts.
as
a
spearhead
for
this,
mr.
marks
stated
that
some
evidence
of
atkins'
lack
of
preparation
was
the
fact
that
he
should
--
he
undoubtedly
knew
or
should
have
known
that
five
days
prior
to
the
day
of
trial,
you
had
the
file
list
preparatory
challenge
under
170.6
or
it
wasn't
timely
and
which
was
so
held
in
this
case.
therefore,
if
mr.
atkins
knew
that,
he
also
knew
that
the
highest
court
in
our
state,
state
supreme
court,
has
held
that
where
two
defendants
desire
to
--
whe
--
where
defendant
desires
to
dismiss
the
judge
under
170.6
where
a
codefendant
has
dismissed
the
judge
under
170.6,
the
code
--
the
--
the
defendant
then
desiring
to
exercise,
it
much
show
a
conflict
of
interest
or
an
adverse
interest
to
the
one
exercising
it.
what
i'm
saying
is
this,
that
in
--
in
california,
as
i've
submitted
in
the
other
state,
there
are
numerous
judges
that
either
defendants
or
plaintiffs
or
--
or
both
don't
particularly
desire
to
have
their
case
heard
in
front
of
or
the
feeling
they're
summoned
to
prejudice
of
some
kind.
mr.
atkins
had
available
here,
two
challenges,
if
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
between
meyes
and
douglas.
he
could
have
had
meyes
execute
this
--
this
one
and
then
save
the
other
one
in
case
he
got
into
some
other
judges'
court
he
didn't
like
then
douglas
could
have
done
it.
he
would
have
had
two
shots,
he
didn't.
they
filed
a
joint
affidavit
of
prejudice.
and
i
submit
that
--
that
this
launches
us
into
a
discussion.
i'm
not
saying
that's
a
lot
of
evidence
at
all.
i'm
just
saying
that
utilizing
mr.
marks'
argument
about
that
170.6.
it
is
a
good
focal
point
to
turn
into
the
actual
conflict.
now,
assuming
this
court
desires
to
impose
the
rule
of
--
the
federal
rule
of
glasser
upon
the
states,
they
will
--
they
can
do
so
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
hold
at
any
given
set
of
facts,
the
denial
of
separate
counsel
and
analogizing
to
the
betts-brady
type
situation.
in
a
given
situation
if
the
facts
are
there,
denial
of
separate
counsel
where
there's
a
conflict
of
interest
might
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
is
this
such
a
case?
i
submit,
no.
and
for
the
following
reasons.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
are
you
referring
--
you
mean
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
oh,
no,
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
ju
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
--
justice
black.
what
i'm
saying
is
now
turning
from
the
preparation
point
and
i
submit
that
the
record
su
--
supports
judge
rhone's
valid
exercise
of
his
discretion.
i
am
just
isolating
the
point
of
conflict
for
argument
only,
of
course
not.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that.
but
if
--
if
there
are
no
other
circumstances
and
we're
left
with
a
conflict,
let
--
i'd
like
to
address
myself
just
to
that
conflict
point
alone
and
see
whether
there's
any
substance
to
it.
now,
what
is
mr.
atkins
showing
for
a
conflict
and
the
only
showing,
remembering
the
principle
or
remembering
the
--
in
the
facts
in
the
glasser
case
where
mr.
stewart
showed
or
stated
orally
and
stated
that
he
had
filed
an
affidavit
that
there
had
been
conversations
where
glasser
wasn't
present.
there
were,
in
other
words,
witnesses
that
would
--
would
have
testimony
that
wouldn't
affect
glasser
but
would
affect
kretske,
in
other
words,
a
substantial
trial
tactical
conflict
between
the
interest
of
kretske
and
glasser.
let's
turn
to
our
case.
mr.
atkins
made
only
one
real
statement
and
that
all
he
did
was
bring
up
the
murder
trials.
he
said,
“what
has
happened
since
then
after
mr.
carr
asking
to
show
what
the
conflict
is?”
recalling
that
mr.
carr
had
told
the
judge,
“our
evidence
will
be
related
to
the
--
relating
to
the
13
counts
that
these
men
both
rob
so
and
so,
both
rob
so
and
so,
both
the
solid
so
and
so
(inaudible).”
and
then
later,
he
said
--
he
said,
“as
to
the
robbery
transactions,
i
enumerate
in
the
court,
that
evidence
was
introduced
on
both
of
these
homicide
matters.”
the
defendants
testified
concerning
those
robberies
and
their
testimony
made
a
general
and
categorical
denial
as
any
participation
of
those
robberies.
they
didn't
try
to
throw
the
blame
on
the
commission
of
the
robberies.
douglas
didn't
attempt
to
throw
it
on
meyes.
meyes
didn't
attempt
to
throw
it
on
douglas.
they
got
up,
offered
independent
alibis.
douglas
offered
one
--
one
witness
only
as
to
one
of
the
dates
and
otherwise
just
categorically
denied
and
meyes
did
likewise
offering
no
other
witnesses.
now,
that
is
all
the
showing.
he
just
says,
“now,
i
can
defend
--
what
has
happen
since?
well,
something
has
happened
since
then,
your
honor.
douglas
was
acquitted
and
bennie
meyes
was
convicted
of
this
murder.
and
that's
all
really,
subs
--
substantively
that
he
--
he
brought
up.
now,
go
--
going
back
to
what
mr.
marks
stated,
he
--
he
has
stated
that
in
--
in
talking
about
another
point
that
the
--
the
robberies
were
subsidiary
to
the
murder.
and
we
say
here,
this
murder
is
subsidiary
to
the
robberies.
those
men
were
tried
on
a
murder.
one
was
acquitted
and
one
was
convicted.
but
getting
--
staying
away
from
the
prior
record
aspects,
first,
going
right
to
the
actual
trial
conflict,
the
tactical
trial
conflict,
there
was
non-showing
from
that
as
in
glasser.
i
submit
that,
there
--
there
was
none.
the
only
conflict,
and
i'll
turn
to
that
in
a
minute,
that
mr.
mitchelson
raises
it
all
is
the
--
is
the
fact
that
these
two
men
were
--
had
to
go
to
trial
and
one
had
some
--
one
had
three
priors
and
one
had
an
allegedly
clean
record.
we
submit
and
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
the
only
thing
i
can
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
think
he'd
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
think
he'd
be
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well,
i
think
he'd
be
a
heck
of
a
magician
if
he
could
on
that
basis
alone,
your
honor.
he
had
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
alright,
fine.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well,
the
--
the
only
point
is
and
--
and
again
with
our
offer
of
the
--
of
the
preliminary
transcripts,
we
can
also
offer
if
--
if
it
gets
down
to
that
point
as
you've
just
stated
to
lodge
this
murder
transcripts
also.
the
point
is
this,
that
these
witnesses
as
to
the
robberies
were
tied
down
as
to
what
their
testimony
is.
and
i
submit
that
while
there's
--
there's
variances
here
and
there
as
to
what
one
was
wearing
and
one
wasn't
wearing
and
this
and
that
and
other
thing.
substantially,
their
testimony
in
the
crucial
particulars
in
the
robberies,
in
--
in
the
second
murder
trial
and
the
preliminary
and
in
the
instant
case
is
across
the
board.
there
is
--
there
is
nothing
like
existed
in
glasser.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
okay.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well,
your
--
no,
i
wouldn't
your
honor
but
on
the
other
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
think
i
would
but
on
the
other
hand,
remember
this,
that
the
murder
trial,
the
murder
trial
can
only
come
in
here
in
a
very,
very
limited
way.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
yes,
but
in
--
it's
such
a
very
limited
way.
in
other
words
--
first
of
all,
the
only
reason
that
--
that
the
murder
could
be
offered
in
respect
to
these
robbery
trials
at
all
was
just
to
show
that
at
the
time
they
were
arrested,
they
attempted
to
evade
arrest
as
a
reflection
on
their
--
their
feeling
of
guilt.
and
also
douglas,
at
that
time,
acknowledged
that
he
committed
these
robberies
along
with
meyes.
and
in
--
in
other
words,
that
was
--
that
was
the
sole
point.
the
main
point
they're
going
to
have
to
get
around
is
regardless
of
--
of
the
acquittal
and
the
conviction,
what
about
these
eight
--
eight
witnesses
who
has
combined
total
is
eyewitness
identification
of
these
fellows
as
perpetrators
of
the
instant
crimes
charged
all
the
way
down
the
line
as
--
is
joint
an
equal
participants.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well,
i
think
you're
right,
sir.
but
on
the
other
hand,
what
i'm
attempting
to
show
is
that
--
that
the
murder
aspect
of
it
was
still
--
is
still
a
very
minor
part.
and
i
don't
see
how
a
counsel
can
really
--
in
other
words,
you're
not
--
i
--
i
don't
think
if
you
got
that
case,
you're
going
to
say
because
it
was
acquitted
of
the
murder
automatically,
jump
for
joy
and
say
that,
“i'm
getting
off
these
robberies
easy”
because
he
wasn't
acquitted
of
the
murder
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
think
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well,
there's
some
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
--
as
to
how
much
--
whether
they
could
really
and
truly
get
the
murders
in
--
in
that
degree
where
you'd
be
able
to
tactically
take
advantage
or
not
take
advantage
of
them
really.
i
don't
think
you
could
get
enough
for
that
murder
trial
in
that
it
would
give
you
a
true
conflict
and
--
and
a
true
advantage
or
disadvantage
and
--
and
either
having
them
convicted
or
acquitted.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
think
so.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
sincerely
do
the
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
alright,
in
one
--
there's
--
with
--
with
one
--
with
one
qualification
if
--
if
meyes
has
offered
as
a
witness
then
they
can
bring
out
a
prior
murder
conviction
but
not
that
--
i
don't
think
they
can
identify
it
as
that
murder
conviction
for
killing
police
officer
nash
who
--
who
shot
him
when
they
were
arrested.
they
can
only
bring
out
the
name
of
the
felony
for
purposes
of
impeachment,
the
--
what
the
felony
was
and
whether
he
served
time
on
or
something
like
that.
and
that's
all.
they
can't
identify
that
felony.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well,
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
don't
know
if
they
--
no,
i'm
--
i'm
not
too
familiar
in
this
aspect
because
i'm
not
a
trial
lawyer
per
se.
but
i
--
i
think
--
i
don't
think
they
could
identify
as
a
murder
trial.
i
think
they
could
say,
“did
you
formally
testify
in
court
and
give
the
date?”
and
--
and
the
--
the
court
and
--
and
then
read
--read
his
testimony
or
let
him
read
it
and
then
say,
“how
does
square
with
your
version
now
so
to
speak?”
but
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
that's
another
point.
anytime
you
go
to
trial
and
this
gets
--
this
gets
in
to
the
idea
of
trying
two
men,
one
with
a
clean
record
and
one
with
a
bad
record,
this
is
in
grounds
for
severance.
and
i
--
i
can't
see
that
it's
a
grounds
for
a
--
also,
excuse
me,
one
minute.
i
just
thought
of
something
--
mr.
justice
black,
in
relation
to
your
question,
don't
forget,
i
--
i
don't
think
mr.
--
mr.
atkins,
the
public
defender,
really
spelled
out
the
conflict
when
you
look
at
this
record
to
--
to
judge
rhone.
he
--
one's
being
convicted
and
one's
being
acquitted,
i
--
i
don't
think
he
really
went
in
--
went
in
to
it
and
attempted
to
--
to
demonstrate
as
--
as
mr.
stewart
did
in
the
glasser
case,
just
what
the
ramification
to
this
worried,
just
at
once
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
oh,
he
strenuously
argued
a
conflict.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
yes,
he
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well,
now,
i
don't
know
how
strenuous
that
--
that
is
because
of
the
various
things
i
couldn't
prepara
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
and
in
other
words,
he
--
he
was
pretty
equivocal
about
that.
and
then
on
page
81
as
i
read,
he
said,
“no,
as
my
humble
opinion,
they've
got
a
lawyer
who's
ready,
willing
and
able
to
try
their
case
for
him.”
that's
not
very
equivocal.
but
in
any
rate
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
maybe.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i'll
try
--
i'd
like
to
try
and
close
and
leave
mr.
james
some
time
on
this
right
to
counsel
on
appeal.
and
i'll
close
with
this.
the
only
other
--
the
only
other
point
brought
out
it
--
that
might
--
we
--
we
might
examine
as
a
possible
conflict
is
what
about
this,
where
a
man
is
put
to
trial
with
another
man
and
they
both
have
priors.
i
submit
that
there
are
many,
many
types
of
people
that
are
put
to
trial
together
and
--
and
may
have
one
counsel,
may
have
two
counsels.
they
probably
just
didn't
even
want
to
be
--
be
in
trial
with
that
person.
in
other
words,
the
fact
that
a
man
has
priors
alone
is
enough
reason
to
say
not
to
want
on
your
own
prior
as
a
defendant
to
be
tried
with
him
because
even
if
he's
got
separate
counsel,
there's
a
chance
that
that
might
rub
off
or
if
he
stays
up
the
stand,
the
jury
is
going
to
draw
a
bad
anyway
any
way
against
him.
and
i
don't
think
that
--
that
this
in
and
off
itself
either
as
a
matter
of
due
process
or
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law
is
enough.
now,
i
will
say
this
that
this
record
shows
adequately
that
the
trial
judge,
mr.
atkins,
too,
before
he
was
dismissed
and
the
prosecutor
drove
home
to
the
jury
and
on
the
basis
that
mr.
atkins
undoubtedly
intended
to
place
mr.
meyes
on
the
stand,
drove
home
the
effect
that
this
jury
should
pay
those
prior
convictions.
i
have
reference
to
page
65
by
mr.
atkins.
no
excuse
me,
page
65,
mr.
atkins.
he
stated
if
it
came
to
your
knowledge
that
one
of
these
defendants
had
been
convicted
of
a
very
serious
felony
in
the
past,
first,
i
will
ask
you
that
part.
first,
would
you
be
able
to
keep
that
felony
conviction
separate
and
apart
from
the
other
defendant
in
the
case?
again,
i'm
going
to
go
down
the
line
on
it.
by
that
question,
i
mean
i
am
just
asking
you
if
you
think
you
would
be
capable
of
not
letting
that
conviction
taint
the
other
person
in
anyway,
in
other
words,
the
“birds
of
a
feather
attitude”.
the
judge
inter
--
interrupting
at
this
point
said,
“well,
before
you
do
that,
i
think
that
those
who
have
not
set
on
a
jury
case
before
should
understand
that
a
witness
maybe
asked
if
he
has
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony
and
it
can
be
--
that
can
be
asked
only
in
one
basis
and
that
is
for
the
possible
impeachment
of
him
as
a
witness
and
that
could
be
the
only
basis
it
can
be
considered.
it
cannot
be
considered
for
any
other
purpose.
all
12
jurors
answering
they
could
keep
that
fact
of
mine.
and
it
might
be
added
that
it's
--
it's
a
standard
ins
--
instruction.
and
if
mr.
meyes
had
actually
taken
the
stand
in
this
trial
and
had
not
--
never
denied
his
prior
as
if
he
did
not
or
if
he
had
never
admitted
his
priors,
if
he
admits
his
priors,
they
won't
be
brought
up
again
except
on
the
impeachment
basis.
but
if
he
took
the
stand
and
they
came
up
on
that
basis
then
the
--
the
judge
would
have
instructed
the
jury
later
that
evidence
has
been
received
of
other
crimes
and
he
had
told
them
exactly
what
they
were
supposed
to
consider
it
for.
and
we
can
only
assume
and
hope
that
jurors
follow
those
instructions.
and
with
that,
i'll
turn
the
argument
over
to
mr.
james.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court's
indulgence,
mr.
james
and
i
will
utilize
the
same
split
we
did
at
the
last
argument;
that
is,
i'll
address
myself
to
the
matter
of
the
discretion
on
the
continuance
motion
and
the
conflict
point,
mr.
james
will
discuss
the
right
to
counsel
on
appeal.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
by
way
of
introduction,
however,
i
would
like
to
just
make
a
conclusionary
statement
to
a
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is,
that
meyes
filed
a
complete
brief
raising
fully
the
matter
of
the
continuances
and
also
raising
the
grounds
that
he
should
have
had
counsel
on
appeal
which
is
one
of
the
points
we're
here.
and
i
have
an
eight-page
argument
in
citation
of
cases,
lanigan,
robinson,
glasser,
kerfoot
case
in
california,
but
i
didn't
concede
the
point.
that
was
an
over
generous
statement
on
the
part
of
my
brother
counsel,
i
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
offer
these
briefs
and
this
court.
i
don't
think
if
i
had
conceded
it
but
we
raised
it
merely
because
the
point
was
there
and
frequently
we
do
have
these
in
pro
probates
in
our
briefs
in
our
office
and
when
we're
reviewing
them,
if
we
find
anything
in
the
record
that
hasn't
been
touched
on
by
their
briefs,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
our
office
raises
the
point,
discusses
it,
distinguishes
cases
etcetera.
so
the
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
no,
it
was
raised
by
myself
in
absence
of
any
comment
on
it,
however,
in
the
lower
appellate
opinion
does
not
mean
that
they
may
very
well
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief,
i
just
felt
there
was
no
substance
to
it
and
i
commented
on
it.
but
i
think
a
reverse
on
point
right
to
counsel
on
appeal
and
the
remand
is
going
to
--
along
would
raise
a
lot
of
problems
because
i
think
the
matter
has
been
reviewed.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i'll
cover
that
right
to
my
argument
now,
sir.
the
conflict
was
raised,
i
believe,
at
about
page
30
or
31
of
the
record.
the
first
thing
that
happened,
atkins
was
--
or
the
public
defenders
office
was
appointed
for
purposes
of
these
crimes,
these
13
counts
on
--
formally
on
august
18th,
1959.
on
august
21st,
public
defender's
office
was
again
represented
by
deputy
in
court
and
the
defendants
were
arraigned.
on
september
30th,
the
opening
day
of
trial,
mr.
atkins
comes
in
and
he
first
goes
--
filed
a
motion
under
civil
code
of
procedure
--
california
code
of
procedure
170.6
which
is
a
preemptory
challenge
to
the
trial
judge,
which
for
obvious
reasons,
has
to
be
filed
sometime
in
advance
if
the
trial
judge
is
known
beforehand.
otherwise,
it's
going
to
interfere
with
the
due
administration
of
justice
if
we
could
just
come
in
on
opening
day
of
trial
and
hand
this
in,
so
that
was
disallowed.
then
atkins
said,
“well
i'm
not
--”
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
yes,
sir.
it
was
not
filed
timely.
in
other
words,
judge
ronnie
had
been
sitting
in
this
court,
a
couple
of
months
at
least,
minimum
and
it
was
known
long
beforehand.
it
was
known
since
--
more
than
10
days
before
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
--
the
motion
had
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
so
well,
it
would
--
it
would
serve
to
prevent
mr.
carr,
the
prosecutor
from
doing
what
he
did,
having
all
his
witnesses
in
court
ready
to
go
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
--
on
september
30.
this
--
this
point
also
goes
to
the
matter
of
continuance
for
preparation
and
other
grounds
which
i'll
discuss.
now,
one
thing
that
my
brother
marks
left
out
is
procedurally,
and
this
is
done
all
the
time
and
it's
--
it's
before
this
court
by
way
of
citation
of
the
kerfoot
case
in
california
in
our
briefs.
the
public
defender,
when
he
comes
up
with
a
conflict
or
an
idea
of
lack
of
preparation
or
needs
more
time,
he
can
go
to
the
court
and
get
an
advancing
date,
and
the
court
will
put
aside
a
few
minutes
and
he'll
come
in
as
he
did
in
kerfoot,
the
case
was
set
for
trial
in
kerfoot
on
september
14th
and
on
september
1st,
at
the
request
of
the
public
defender,
the
cause
was
advanced,
then
he
came
in
and
he
said,
your
honor,
i've
had
a
problem
with
my
clients
here.
i've
talked
to
him
just
once.
i
think
there's
a
conflict.
i'm
not
prepared.
we
don't
even
have
the
transcript
yet.
we're
going
to
need
more
time.
and
the
court
made
a
ruling.
so
it's
not
uncommon
for
--
and
in
harmony,
with
due
administration
of
justice
to
advance
these
causes
and
make
known
in
advance
the
particular
reasons
you
might
want
a
conflict
or
a
continuance
for
more
preparation
time.
so
that
was
not
done
here
and,
of
course,
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
atkins
preparation
apart
from
the
conflict
and
in
keeping
with
--
or
in
sort
of
a
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
last
questions
of
my
brother
marks,
at
page
80,
when
meyes,
who
was
the
first
one
to
--
this
is
so-called
palaver
about
dismissal
of
counsel,
this
judge
was
not
going
to
dismiss
the
counsel
unless
these
men
made
an
unqualified
dismissal.
that
is
they
full
well
knew
that
when
they
dismiss
them,
they
were
on
their
own.
now,
the
conflict
figures
into
this,
but
i'll
cover
that
later,
but
he
wanted
an
unqualified
dismissal.
he
won't
let
counsel
go
unless
these
men
fully
understand
that
they're
going
to
have
to
board
out
the
jury,
argue
to
the
jury,
cross-examine
witnesses,
they're
going
to
be
on
their
own.
and
at
page
80,
meyes
said,
“i
don't
want
you
under
any
circumstances”
to
atkins
and
that
was
the
ultimate
qualification.
then
the
judge
turned,
judge
ron
turned
to
douglas
and
says,
“what's
your
feeling?”
and
he
says
the
same
thing.
it's
right
at
page
80.
now,
the
basic
california
penal
code
section
on
continuances
and
it's
certainly
a
reasonable
one
and
in
harmony
with
mr.
justice
black's
expression
of
this
type
of
procedure
in
avery
versus
alabama
is
penal
code
section
1050.
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
state
of
california
requires
that
all
proceedings
and
criminal
cases
shall
be
set
for
trial
and
heard
and
determined
at
the
earliest
possible
time.
no
continuance
of
a
criminal
trial
should
be
granted
except
on
affirmative
proof
in
open
court
upon
reasonable
notice.
therefore,
in
our
case,
since
these
motions
were
all
made
on
the
opening
day
of
trial,
that's
certainly
not
reasonable
notice.
therefore,
we're
going
to
have
to
have
an
awfully
strong
showing
to
get
around
an
abuse
of
--
to
get
around
in
exercise
of
the
discretion
that
judge
ron
did
utilize
in
this
case.
so
let's
--
let's
look
at
the
facts
of
our
case
before
this
court
now
forgetting
the
murder
cases
for
the
present
moment,
except
insofar
as
they
may
apply
--
implied
by
this
point.
why
did
atkins
want
a
continuance?
page
29
says,
“there
are
13
counts.
the
defense
is
not
ready
because
we
have
not
been
able
to
complete
the
investigation
as
to
certain
offenses
which
we're
trying
to
develop
as
to
these
many
dates”.
however
the
facts
show
that
the
--
and
this
was
the
only
purpose
counsel
before
you
offers
to
lodge
the
murder
trial
transcripts
because
in
that,
there
are
11
of
the
13
counts
in
our
case
before
us
were
gone
into
thoroughly,
the
same
witnesses,
the
same
testimony
was
offered.
it
comprises
approximately
287
pages
of
the
3819
page
murder
transcript
of
cross-examination
and
examination
of
these
witnesses.
these
trials
were
had
in
may
and
february
of
the
prior
year
or
of
the
same
year;
may
1959
and
february
1959,
and
remember
--
recalling
our
trials
in
september
1959
on
these
cases.
and
the
deputy
public
defender
breckenridge
had
handled
this
case
and
as
mr.
mitchelson
says,
he
did
a
very
competent
adequate
job.
after
all
his
men
were
charged
with
killing
a
police
officer,
second
degree
in
acquittal
is,
i
think,
an
excellent
tribute
to
their
endeavors.
now,
mr.
breckenridge
is
in
the
same
office
as
atkins
and
also
ancillary
to
this,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
on
august
3rd
and
4th,
a
preliminary
hearing
was
handled
in
this
matter
and
deputy
public
defender's
sought
there,
represented
both
to
these
men.
nothing
was
raised
of
the
conflict
at
that
time,
almost
60
days
prior
to
the
date
of
trial.
nothing
was
raised
about
any
conflict
on
august
18th
when
the
deputy
public
defender
was
formerly
appointed
for
purposes
of
this
case.
nothing
was
raised
on
august
21st
when
they
were
back
in
court
for
arraignment.
no
advance
whatsoever
in
dates
for
raising
any
lack
of
preparation
or
conflict
or
anything.
this
is
done
--
all
done
september
30th,
the
opening
morning
of
trial.
now
getting
back
to
the
continuance,
the
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
no
there
had
not.
there
had
not,
but
i
still
say
to
that.
this
was
the
opening
day
of
trial,
the
witnesses
were
all
there,
and
they
had
many
occasions.
these
judges
in
los
angeles,
they're
not
hesitant
about
any
continuances
of
criminal
cases.
if
they
get
any
kind
of
reasonable
notice,
they'll
grant
10,
12,
14
of
them,
but
on
opening
day
of
trial,
it's
a
little
bit
different
situation.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
they
had
been
incarcerated,
that's
true.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
would
assume
they
had
been
incarcerated
from
the
time
of
their
arrest
in
november
of
or
latter
part
of
1958
when
they're
arrested
for
the
police
killing,
which
--
the
sequence
of
events
where
the
robberies
all
antedated
the
killing
of
the
officer
and
these
--
these
robberies
were
offered
for
--
in
a
very
important
aspect
of
this
case.
now
recall
--
in
one
of
atkins
grounds
that
he
want
to
continue,
is
he
hadn't
have
time
to
investigate
the
alibis.
well,
these
crimes
occurred
in
the
middle
of
1958,
and
they
were
offered
to
show
motive
as
to
why
douglas
and
meyes
would
lie
and
wait
in
his
back
bedroom
for
this
officer
having
heard
him
at
the
front
door
and
knew
he
--
knowing
he
was
coming
back,
lying
in
wait,
and
when
the
officer
walked
in
shoot
him.
now
since
that
was
such
an
important
part
of
the
--
of
the
prosecution's
theory,
we
would
submit
that
there
--
the
very
ample
reason
why
public
defender
breckenridge
and
mr.
mitchelson
do
all
they
could
to
produce
whatever
alibis
for
those
dates
they
could
to
negate
that
element
and
in
fact,
mr.
mitchelson
did
offer
on
behalf
of
douglas
a
--
an
alibi
for
the
july
25th
charge.
i
believe
he
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
and
his
sister
testified
that
he
was
home
painting
her
bedroom
or
something
on
that
day.
and
otherwise,
as
to
all
other
dates,
both
categorically
denied
the
commission,
but
there
is
reason
they
would
want
to
develop
these
alibis.
and
so,
to
that
extent,
mr.
breckenridge,
and
i'm
sure
that
he
would
share
anything
he
had
with
mr.
solar
who
would
share
it
with
mr.
atkins.
in
our
office,
in
the
attorney
general's
office,
it's
true.
the
attorney
general
as,
your
honor
knows,
is
the
attorney
general
but
he's
got
deputies
running
all
over
the
state.
now,
we
get
a
criminal
case
like
on
appeal,
the
douglas-meyes
case
comes
to
me
but
i
don't
just
pick
it
up
on
the
day
before
on
the
file
of
brief
and
that
out
of
brief.
i
have
the
case
in
advance
with
all
my
other
cases,
and
i
have
to
organize
my
time
to
put
--
put
in
time
on
the
matters
that
i've
been
working
in
including
douglas
and
meyes
and
then
if
i'm
really
pressed,
i
can
go
into
court
and
in
this
case
would
be
the
appellate
court,
i
can
file
an
affidavit
for
an
extension
of
time,
but
i
doing
it
--
do
it
in
advance.
i
don't
let
the
court
calendar
the
case
for
oral
argument,
so
it's
not
unreasonable.
these
logs
are
very
harmonious
with
the
fast
and
due
administration
of
justice
which
would
be
thwarted
if
on
the
day
of
--
opening
day
of
trial
a
man
could
come
in
and
say
i
want
a
new
counsel,
i
want
this,
i
want
that.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
there
were
10
counts
of
robbery,
two
counts
of
assault
and
one
count
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
murder.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
believe
there
were
probably
--
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
this
record
does.
it
has
all
of
the
witnesses
that
were
called
in
the
murder
cases.
i
believe
there
are
approximately
10
in
number
give
or
take
one
or
two.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
that
--
the
very
same
question
was
asked
at
the
last
argument,
justice
goldberg
and
what
i
think
the
judge
was
referring
to,
judge
ron
is
that
day.
in
other
words,
they
came
out
and
asked
for
the
continuance.
i
believe
he
asked
for
continuance
because
douglas'
mother
was
ill.
he
also
asked
for
a
continuance
so
he
could
get
a
hold
of
an
attorney
named
leo
brandon,
the
record
shows
leo
brandon
and
so
--
i
think
he
was
referring
strictly
to
that
the
same
day,
right.
now,
just
a
few
closing
remarks
on
this
preparation
point,
i'll
get
right
to
the
conflict.
i
think
the
record
also
shows
that
--
well,
let's
--
let's
put
it
this
way.
a
trial
judge
is
faced
with
the
same
type
of
problem
as
the
jury
is
faced
when
they're
appraising
the
truth
or
credibility
of
a
witness
on
the
stand,
when
an
attorney
stands
before
him
and
asks
for
a
continuance.
and
remember
that
this
was
the
day
of
the
trial.
the
judge
looks
at
the
attorney.
he
has
to
use
his
judgely
intuition
if
such
a
word
exists
and
decide,
is
this
man
really
in
trouble,
i
mean,
can
he
be
prepared
to
go
now
or
is
he
really
in
bad
shape
and
his
clients
will
suffer.
judge
ron
made
a
decision.
he
listened
to
the
very
meager
showing
on
the
part
of
--
on
the
matters
of
continuance
for
preparation
and
alibis
of
judge
--
of
public
defender
atkins.
and
he
made
a
decision.
now
the
showing
was
--
he
needed
more
time
for
the
alibis
and
of
course
these
crimes
were
long
antedated.
there
have
been
two
murder
trials
in
which
there
had
been
ample
need
for
these
men
to
produce
alibis
if
they
had
them.
so
he
denied
that
part
of
it.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
no,
no
alibis
for
the
robberies
that
were
introduced
in
the
murder
trial
which
are
the
same
robberies,
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
other
words,
they
had
every
reason
to
produce
alibis
for
these
particular
robberies
because
these
robberies
were
introduced
to
show
that
the
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
lying
in
wait
theory.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
and
therefore,
they
should
have
had
a
--
if
they
had
alibis,
they
would
have
a
record
of
those
alibis
right
in
september
30th,
1959
when
he
walked
in.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
now,
what
was
the
other
grounds
he
said
he
wasn't
prepared
on.
he
said
--
he
said,
“well,
i
haven't
cross
index
or
he
said
i
haven't
prepared
the
prior
transcripts
as
much
as
i'd
like.
well,
the
judge
recognized
at
page
44,
the
trial
judge
recognized
that
those
robberies
formed
a
very
small
part
of
the
total
transcript
and
this
murder
transcript
was
a
big
transcript
and
there
were
only
287
to
300
pages
of
that
transcript
that
went
to
the
robbery
counts.
so
--
and
also,
the
preliminary,
he
had
the
preliminary
and
everything
and
he
just
felt
that
on
this
point
alone,
there
was
no
reason
for
that.
he's
vindicated
later
in
this
judgment
by
the
record
when
--
well,
he's
vindicated
throughout
the
record
later
and
i
submit
--
well
i
quote
these
points
out
of
context.
i
still
--
i
still
say
that
they
reflect
a
feeling
on
atkins'
part
that
he
could
go.
at
page
32,
he
makes
the
statement
on
my
own
part.
i
feel
that
i'm
--
i
am
prepared.
i'd
like
--
i
believe
he
goes
on.
i'd
like
to
work
over
the
transcripts
a
little
bit
more
and
the
other
thing.
on
page
75,
he
makes
the
statement.
i
prepared
this
case
so
that
i
can
defend
it
now.
he
again,
goes
back
i
believe
and
refers
to
the
record.
he'd
like
to
go
over
these
prior
records
again.
later
on
when
prosecutor
carr
suggests
that
these
two
men
--
that
atkins
stay
on
and
advised
these
men
during
their
--
during
their
presentation,
they're
on
defense.
public
defenders,
like
any
other
lawyer,
do
not
like
this
procedure
and
absolutely
tried
to
avoid
it
and
mr.
atkins
did
here.
he
said,
“i
prepare
this
case
so
i
can
defend
it
now,”
and
he
later
on
--
as
to
page
75
and
page
80
--
no,
at
page
81
going
to
what
i
just
said,
if
these
defendants
want
an
attorney
to
represent
them,
i'm
here
qualified
and
ready
to
try
their
case
for
them.
he
--
and
then
he
told
the
judge,
he'd
like
not
to
do
it
in
an
advisory
capacity.
page
81
again,
he
says,
“they
have
an
opportunity
to
get
an
attorney
who
in
my
humble
estimation
is
equal
to
the
task”.
this
does
not
sound
like
an
unprepared
man
to
me
and
i
think
the
judge
was
fully
vindicated
in
his
earlier
denial
of
the
continuance
for
preparation
and
alibis.
now,
let's
turn
to
the
conflict.
in
view
of
the
mr.
fortas'
kind
compliment
paid
to
the
chief
yesterday
for
california's
system
on
indigence,
i
think
it
would
be
of
interest
to
this
court
as
an
introduction
to
this
point
to
point
out
some
figures
that
we
just
got
last
night
over
the
phone
from
the
superior
court
--
los
angeles
superior
court
commissioner's
office
and
we
could
later
corroborate
these
figures
by
certified
letter
from
that
office.
in
19
--
fiscal
year
1960,
1961,
los
angeles
county
paid
to
a
private
appointed
counsel
where
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest,
disqualification
of
the
public
defender's
office,
$102,352.41.
the
public
defender's
los
angeles
operation,
los
angeles
county
operation
for
that
year,
cost
of
attorneys
and
running
the
office
was
$748,973.68
or
a
total
of
$851,326.09.
for
fiscal
year,
1961-1962,
the
los
angeles
county
paid
the
private
counsel
appointed
because
of
the
same
reason,
disqualification
of
the
public
defender,
$214,240.16
or
more
than
double
the
year
earlier
and
the
public
defender's
operation
costs
$917,501.12,
a
total
cost
to
los
angeles
county
for
indigents
of
$1,131,741.28.
these
figures
are
not
offered
to
put
a
price
on
due
process
in
this
particular
case.
they're
offered
strictly
for
information
and
on
the
--
to
show
that
a
lawyer
like
--
a
judge
like
judge
ron,
when
he
has
a
man
standing
in
front
of
him,
asking
for
private
counsel
because
he's
got
a
conflict
with
his
brother
in
crime
so
to
speak,
he's
got
a
--
he's
got
a
heavy
cost
factor
and
i
think
that
this
cost
factor
is
reasonable.
in
other
words,
this
is
the
expense
of
almost
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
for
private
attorneys
where
there's
a
conflict,
it's
reasonable
for
judge
ron
to
look
down
and
say,
“let's
have
a
showing.
what
is
your
conflict?”
i
don't
think
that
due
process
compels
the
conclusion
that
the
lawyer,
the
public
defender
can
merely
say,
“i've
got
a
--
these
men
have
got
a
conflict”.
i
think
that
a
pro
forma
showing
can
be
made.
now
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
it's
hard
to
say,
i
don't
know.
they're
going
to
be
calling
the
same
witnesses
at
second
trial
trying
to
martial
the
evidence.
the
public
defender's
office,
if
they
represent
them
in
both
cases.
that
would
present
a
real
problem.
i
think
it
could
present
a
cost
problem
also.
now,
i
offer
these
--
as
i
say,
these
figures
to
show
that
judge
ron
was
with
--
i
think
entitled
to
a
showing.
now,
whether
or
not
there
was
efficient
showing
existed
in
this
case,
that's
why
we're
here,
but
that
is
the
only
reason
i
offer
those
figures
and
for
whatever
additional
information
the
court
might
glean
from.
now,
let's
--
let's
look
at
the
conflict
of
interest.
now,
mr.
mitchelson
spent
a
considerable
time
on
the
murder
cases.
i
offered
the
--
i
offer
--
they're
sitting
on
the
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right,
right.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
exactly.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
well,
mr.
mitchelson
spent
considerable
time
on
these
murder
cases
and
i
lodge
them
or
i
offer
to
lodge
them
with
this
court
merely
to
show
that
the
witnesses,
the
same
witnesses
except
one,
jenny
bucker,
all
the
other
witnesses
testified
in
this
murder
case
or
at
least
murder
trial
number
two
and
one,
and
their
testimony
is
substantially
the
same
except
they
were
subjected
in
the
murder
case
to
a
rigorous
cross-examination.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
no,
no,
these
are
the
robbery
victims.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right,
and
they
were
vigorously
cross-examined
but
their
testimony
has
offered
to
show
that
it's
substantially
the
same
as
it
appears
in
this
record
although,
of
course,
in
this
record
because
of
the
dismissal
of
counsel,
there's
no
cross.
now,
what
was
the
showing
that
mr.
atkins
made?
first
of
all,
remember,
he
--
is
this
conflict
a
burning
issue
in
mr.
atkins
chest
when
he
comes
in?
first
thing
he
says;
he
files
the
170.6
and
no
quarrel
with
that.
then
he
comes
up
with
this
continuance,
he
needed
to
develop
more
alibis.
i
think
that
this
is
somewhat
of
a
reflection
upon
his
own
adjudication,
if
he
really
--
if
he
really
felt
this
conflict
was
that
serious,
i
sincerely
offer
that
he'd
be
urging
that
right
off
the
bat
after
he
challenged
the
judge,
it
may
have
been
refused
but
he
offers
this
as
motion
number
two
and
it's
mixed
in
with
the
motion
for
continuance
because
of
the
sickness
of
douglas'
mother,
things
like
this.
what
is
the
precise
showing?
he
says,
“your
honor,
this
man
went
through
a
murder
trial
and
one
was
convicted
and
one
was
acquitted.
and
i
submit,
and
i
attempted
to
go
into
this
at
length
in
my
brief,
this
murder
trial
is
not
one
of
the
counts.
it
is
true
that
to
a
degree
of
--
a
part
of
this
is
going
to
come
in
--
we
have
the
benefit
of
the
record
to
show
what
part
that
came
in.
mr.
carr
offered
only
sergeant
bitterolf
who
testified
to
the
arrest
of
these
men
and
to
the
fact
that
his
brother
officer
was
shot
and
he
learned
he
later
passed
away
and
that
he
arrested
these
two
men.
they
did
not
call
the
ambulance
drivers
that
were
called
in
the
murder
trial
as
to
possible
admissions
or
the
personnel
in
the
police
force
that
attempted
to
elicit
admissions
and
confessions
for
this
murder
at
the
hospital.
they
did
not
go
into
approximately
3,600
pages
of
the
murder
case
that
--
or
3,700
pages
of
the
murder
case
that
went
before.
as
far
as
the
california
cases
and
mr.
marks
came
to
the
sharp
conclusion
that
that
mere
suggestion
of
a
conflict
should
be
sufficient
by
a
counsel
before
the
court,
the
california
cases
do
not
go
that
far.
there
are
two
cases
that
are
almost
in
all
force
with
glasser
where
they
do.
that
--
those
are
cases
where
the
man
had
counsel
at
the
trial
through
a
mix
up
or
the
other
counsel
getting
out
of
the
case
or
dismissing
and
perhaps
he
did.
they
--
the
judge
says,
“well,
listen.
we
got
to
get
this
case
going.
you,
who
have
been
representing
in
the
--
these
cases
lanigan
or
in
robinson
are
going
to
represent
your
codefendant
as
the
judge
did
with
moyer
stewart
in
glasser
and
kretske
situation.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
in
--
i'll
even
be
more
specific
than
your
question,
justice
white.
in
this
case,
what
would
have
happened
had
judge
ron
felt
there
was
an
ample
showing
of
conflict,
he
would
have
--
he
would
have
said,
well,
there
is
a
conflict
here
–-
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
you
represent
meyes
and
then
we
will
--
i
will
appoint
an
outside
counsel
at
that
time
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
yes.
it's
--
it's
--
it's
usually
always
done
on
request.
i
mean
in
other
words,
that
the
judge
is
under
no
duty
to
ascertain
that
a
conflict
might
arise.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
no,
even
--
even
a
private
counsel
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well,
no.
he
asked
for
the
showing
--
i
mean
he
asked
for
a
showing,
that's
all
what
he
did
here.
and
in
here,
he
made
an
appraisal
that
the
showing
wasn't
sufficient.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
well,
i
don't
want
to
vouch
for
something
i
don't
have
personal
knowledge
of.
i
would
assume
that
it
might
be
in
an
orderly
situation
such
as
that
and
that
in
this
case,
since
it
was
presented
on
the
first
day
judge
ron
was
attempting
to
go
a
little
further
because
he
knew
that
if
he
didn't
call
that
there
was
a
substantial
conflict
and
the
--
he
probably
would
have
had
to
grant
a
continuance
to
get
an
outside
counsel
and
then
give
him
time
to
prepare.
so
therefore,
i
think,
that's
a
--
that's
a
fair
assumption.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
that's
a
very
correct
assumption.
i
do
go
further,
however,
and
say
--
in
looking
at
this
record,
in
saying
or
analyzing
this
record
that,
in
fact,
the
record
bears
out
his
exercise
of
this
discretion.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i'll
quote
the
words,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
oh
yes.
let's
see.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
believe
it's
at
page
32,
right.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
31.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
yes.
he
says,
the
judge
at
the
bottom
of
30
denies
the
motion
for
continuance
on
the
preparation
point
and
mr.
atkins
raises
the
--
i
would
renew
my
motion
for
continuance
for
the
following
reason
and
then
this
time,
he
says,
mr.
douglas
feels
he
would
like
to
have
an
attorney
of
his
own
to
represent
him.
he
feels
that
there
maybe
during
this
trial,
conflict
which
will
arise
in
which
case
he
would
want
an
attorney
of
his
own
to
be
arguing
and
representing
him
alone
apart
from
meyes.
this
seems
to
show
that
not
being
successful
in
the
earlier
motion
for
continuance
douglas
himself
practically
suggested
this,
the
way
the
record
reads
and
then
later
on,
atkins
does
heat
up,
there
are
some
more
pages
of
showing
by
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right,
i'm
sorry.
i
should
have
continued.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
yes,
then
the
judge
asked
for
more
comment
on
the
--
on
that
and
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
yes,
he
is
referring
both
to
the
possible
conflict
and
the
time
to
go
over
the
transcripts
and
prepare
alibis.
he
kind
of
mixes
the
motions
together
there
and
there's
the
--
there's
another
showing
here.
then
the
judge
asked
again
for
a
more
showing
on
the
conflict.
this
is
what
has
happened
since
then.
well,
something
has
happened
since
then
your
honor.
douglas
was
acquitted
and
bennie
meyes
was
convicted.
now,
i
can
defend
both
of
them
but
i'm
in
a
disadvantage
of
--
ought
to
talk
out
of
one
side
of
an
office
one
and
the
other.
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
fair
for
mr.
douglas.
he
should
have
an
attorney
to
take
advantage
of
the
acquittal
and
etcetera.
in
other
words,
the
showing
is
all
as
to
douglas
and
douglas
being
the
one
injured.
this
is
in
response
to
an
earlier
statement
by
mr.
justice
white
or
a
question
regarding
the
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
--
who
fired
first
and
who's
entitled
for
the
benefit.
that's
at
page
36,
mr.
justice
harlan.
now,
i
queried
in
my
brief,
my
respondents
--
my
reply
brief
to
the
--
or
supplemental
reply
brief.
the
man
raises
a
murder
case
that
at
the
most
has
a
very
small
part
in
the
instant
case.
it
goes
only
to
the
arrest,
the
where
and
when
and
how
the
man
was
--
these
two
men
were
arrested.
the
actual
crimes
charged
the
robberies,
the
assaults,
these
witnesses,
we
submit,
testified
side
by
side,
douglas
and
meyes
coming
in.
in
some
case,
douglas
was
kind
of
the
leader
and
in
some
case,
meyes
was
kind
of
the
leader,
but
one
or
the
other,
the
witnesses
place
them
side
by
side
in
all
of
these
establishments
in
the
perpetuation
of
all
of
these
counts.
the
only
--
mr.
carr,
the
prosecutor,
did
in
fact
point
out
to
the
judge
in
his
own
showing
and
i
--
and
it's
somewhere
between
32
and
36,
he
does
make
a
statement
and
read
the
continuance,
well,
i
don't
understand
what
the
conflict
will
be,
and
he's
referring
to
the
defenses,
they
both
categorically
denied
the
commission
of
these
earlier
crimes,
that
was
his
own
comment.
he
was
restricting
himself
to
any
possible
defense
conflict.
that
is
one
man
attempting
to
blame
the
other
for
him.
and
i
would
like
in
a
few
brief
seconds
remaining
to
me
because
mr.
james
wants
to
get
at
the
appellant,
i'd
like
to
point
out
something
that
was
not
touched
on
in
oral
argument
before
and
i
think
it
reflects
a
showing
somewhat
of
atkins'
preparation
in
the
fact
that
atkins
himself
had
prepared
a
defense
within
the
narrow
limitations
of
what
these
men
really
had
available
as
a
defense
and
that
is
attempting
to
hit
at
the
prosecution's
case,
and
i
refer
to
this.
in
the
preliminary
--
in
the
preliminary
hearing,
neither
defendant,
of
course,
takes
the
stand.
that's
just
a
hearing
on
the
evidence
very
generally
and
all
these
witnesses
were
called
and
the
municipal
court
judge,
the
committing
magistrate
binds
them
over
if
there's
adequate
evidence
if
not.
however,
it
submitted
that
in
this
record
of
this
preliminary
of
some
287
or
267
pages,
mr.
solar
occupies
--
he
is
the
deputy
public
defender
that
handled
it
for
both
of
them,
141
pages
cross-examining
these
witnesses.
and
in
that
time,
he
took
him
over
the
--
virtually
the
identical
calls
of
mr.
mitchelson
and
mr.
breckenridge
in
the
earlier
murder
cases
had
--
as
to
perceptive
ability
to
identify
these
witnesses,
attempting
to
show
that
because
of
their
fear,
because
of
eyesight
or
lighting
conditions,
they
couldn't
really
identify
these
men
or
they
might
have
made
some
mistakes
in
identification
of
these
men
as
perpetrators.
now,
at
the
murder
case,
at
least
the
second
murder
case,
mr.
mitchelson
--
mr.
mitchelson's
cross-examination
and
mr.
breckenridge's,
the
deputy
public
defender's
cross-examination
went
further.
of
course,
they're
in
trial
and
that's
another
reason
this
record
was
offered
to
be
lodged.
that
cross-examination
shows
and
recalling
that
no
alibi
witnesses
say
one
where
it
offered
the
murder
case
as
to
these
robberies,
but
that
cross-examination
shows,
attempts
to
commit
a
possible
police
pressure
on
these
witnesses
to
identify
these
men
sort
of
a
police
revenge
theory
type
of
thought.
again,
he
goes
over
to
the
perceptibility
of
the
victims
under
the
theory
and
lighting
conditions
to
identify
them
and
there's
in
fact
an
impeachment
of
the
character
of
these
witnesses
being
in
bookmaking
establishments
possibly
and
being
gamblers
and
that.
of
course,
judge
ron
said
that
even
gamblers
and
bookmakers
are
entitled
not
to
be
robbed
and
i
think
he's
right.
but
that
was
the
attack
used
as
to
this
robbery
evidence
and
the
prior
murder
case
and
then
the
preliminary.
now,
let's
go
to
the
instant
record
and
look
at
atkins'
tact
that
he
used.
remember,
he
did
get
to
actually
start
dowering
the
jury.
he
wasn't
dismissed
until
page
80
and
i
think
his
voir
dire
is
approximately
58
to
page
70.
he
says
to
the
jury,
can
you
visualize
yourself
and
i
will
address
you
all,
can
you
visualize
a
situation,
this
is
at
page
64,
involving
a
policeman
at
the
police
force,
those
involved
in
that
homicide,
he
brings
up
the
homicide,
those
police
officers
involved
in
that
homicide
can
get
themselves
so
worked
up
that
they
would
choose
to
take
the
vengeance
they
think
should
be
done
to
the
perpetrators
of
the
homicide
under
their
own
hands
toward
building
other
cases
against
those
that
they
feel
responsible
for
the
homicide.
there's
a
police
revenge
theory
which
the
judge
--
judge
ron
later
says
--
sustained
an
objection
of
the
question
on
the
grounds
that
this
was
brought
down
and
he
couldn't
be
advancing
his
theories
of
defense
at
this
stage,
but
he
was
attempting
to
educate
the
jury.
he
says
later
on
at
page
--
pages
69
says,
“do
you
believe
that
eyewitnesses
to
events
can
be
wrong?”
and
later,
he
reversed
the
question,
“do
you
believe
that
it
is
possible
that
an
eyewitness
to
an
event
can
make
a
mistake
as
to
the
defendant?”
in
other
words,
whether
it
is
possible
that
a
person
seeing
something
can
then
relate
it
and
believe
he
is
telling
the
truth
and
be
mistaken,
that's
at
page
69.
the
weaknesses
in
the
prosecution's
eyewitness
identification
case,
that's
the
second
theory
of
defense
for
these
men
and
he
is
obviously
going
to
pursue.
i
submit
the
record
also
shows
that
mr.
atkins
had
definitely
decided
to
put
mr.
meyes
on
the
stand
as
well
as
douglas
because
he
does
asked
--
he
asked
the
jury
at
page
65,
if
it
came
to
your
knowledge
that
one
of
these
defendants
had
been
convicted
of
a
very
serious
felony
in
the
past.
first,
i
will
ask
that
part.
first,
would
you
be
able
to
keep
that
felony
conviction
separate
and
apart
from
the
other
defendant
in
this
case?
again,
i'm
going
to
go
down
the
line
out
of
it.
by
that
question,
i
mean,
i
am
just
asking
you
if
you
think
you
would
be
capable
of
not
letting
that
conviction
taint
the
other
person
in
any
way,
in
other
words,
the
birds
of
a
feather
attitude.
and
then
he
goes
on
at
page
65
to
also
ask
the
question,
would
you
let
meyes'
felony
convictions
so
prejudice
you
that
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
appraise
the
prosecution
evidence
against
him,
himself.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
that
was
in
page
--
at
page
65,
i
believe,
voir
dire
questions
of
the
jury
by
mr.
atkins.
now,
i
submit
those
thoughts
merely
to
show
that
there
was
an
awfully
narrow
limitation
within
which
any
counsel,
two
counsels
and
four
counsels,
or
one
counsel
could
work
with
this
case,
and
mr.
atkins
was
in
fact
attempting
to
pursue
that.
the
fact
that
he
was
attempting
to
pursue
that
showed
that
he
certainly
knew
those
prior
records.
he
certainly
knew
the
limitations
under
which
he
was
offered
to
these
men
and
for
any
of
the
reasons
i've
stated
here
and
for
the
analysis
provided
in
the
brief
--
briefs
which
i
have
not
touched
on
here
orally,
i
think
there
was
no
real
conflict
and
that
judge
ron
made
a
proper
exercise
on
the
day
of
trial
and
denied
a
continuance
and
appointment
of
separate
counsel.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
don't
want
to
--
in
other
words,
i
definitely
want
the
record
straight
on
that.
there
is
--
there
was
a
conflict
of
the
murder
trial.
meyes
is
the
one
who
did
the
shooting
and
douglas
was
found
crouched
in
the
corner
and
got
shot
in
the
tail
so
to
speak,
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
--
what
they
were
attempting
to
show
is
that
they
were
both
present
at
this
murder.
they
both
have
the
motive
for
resisting
arrest
and
they
were
called
principals
really.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
but
douglas
and
mr.
mitchelson
did
a
marvelous
job
in
that
case.
douglas
was
--
did
none
of
the
gun
work
in
the
case.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
meyes
went
out
the
window
after
shooting
the
officer
and
they
found
him
a
block
away
and
we
would
submit
that
in
that
particular
case
on
that
--
those
facts
not
related
to
the
robberies,
there
was
a
conflict.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
but
there
--
there
in
fact,
i
don't
know
--
i
didn't
mean
to
gloss
over
our
record
certainly.
that
is
in
this
record
that
sergeant
bitterolf,
when
he
puts
--
when
he
clamps
--
i
guess
when
he
cuffed
or
attempted
to
arrest
douglas,
douglas
said,
“i
was
in
a
lot
of
robberies
with
meyes
and
meyes
has
got
my
gun.
that's
the
one
he
used
to
shoot
the
officer
with
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
they
both
testified
at
the
murder
trial.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
right.
and
they
both
categorically
denied
the
instant
robberies
but
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
oh
no.
i
may
be
subject
to
correction.
mr.
mitchelson
would
have
that
opportunity.
i
read
the
record
and
if
i
recall
correctly,
mr.
meyes,
they
offered
--
oh
wait,
what
happened
is
meyes
attempted
to
defend
on
self-defense
that
the
officer
came
in,
if
i'm
correct,
and
it
was
a
self-defense.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
and
douglas
just
denied
having
anything
to
do
with
it.
he
corroborated
meyes'
self-defense.
i
mean
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
he
attempted
to
make
out
the
officer
the
aggressor
type
of
thing
and
he
tended
to
corroborate
all
of
the
--
many
of
the
factual
statements
meyes
made
about
whether
he
knew
that
this
was
a
police
officer
coming
down
the
hall,
things
like
that,
but
as
far
as
putting
the
blame
on
each
other,
i
don't
think
douglas
stood
up
and
said,
“i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
that
man
killed
him,”
so
to
speak.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
they
attempted
to
bridge
their
defense
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
think
so.
well
i'm
subject
to
correction
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
no
absolutely
not.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
merely
make
this
quick
statement
to
correct
or
not
correct
but
make
sure
you
understand
our
position
on
this
prior
murder
case;
(a)
it's
our
position
as
the
briefs
and
argument
of
events
that
there
was
no
conflict
in
the
receipt
of
evidence
in
this
trial
and/or
possible
defenses
available
by
speculating
through
the
voir
dire
i've
done.
now,
as
to
the
murder
trial,
there
--
it's
my
distinct
remembrance
subject
to
any
correction
these
gentlemen
will
make
that
there
is
absolutely
no
conflict
in
the
receipt
of
the
same
evidence
at
the
murder
trial
on
the
motive
element
and
that
their
defenses
were
consistent
insofar
as
both
categorically
denied
participating
in
these
robberies
with
the
--
and
one
alibi
was
offered
by
douglas
as
to
one
date
that
he
was
at
her
sister's
painting,
but
in
no
attempt
to
blame
the
other.
as
to
the
actual
murder
itself,
we
make
no
contention
that
there
wasn't
an
ample
or
sufficient
conflict
in
the
receipt
of
evidence
and
that
meyes
may
have
been
and
ultimately,
was
found
by
the
jury
to
be
more
culpable
or
culpable
for
the
crime
and
douglas
wasn't,
and
they
attended
advantages
--
disadvantages
of
separate
counsel
in
arguing
this
particular
case
but
there
was
in
fact
no
attempt
by
meyes
or
douglas
to
cast
blame
for
the
crime
of
the
other
to
put
himself
up
or
hoist
himself
up
by
his
own
bootstraps.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
i
think
--
douglas
--
meyes
claimed
a
self-defense.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
because
meyes
was
stuck
with
the
fact
that
he
had
the
gun
and
the
bullet
came
from
his
gun.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
and
douglas,
insofar
as
he
could
corroborate
or
lend
credence
to
anything
meyes'
claimed
did
so
but
by
and
large,
as
i
recall,
he
was
--
he
was
in
the
corner
and
he
had
been
shot
himself
and
for
most
of
the
events,
he'd
been
stuck
that
he
didn't
know
what
exactly
happened,
but
no
defense
conflict
so
to
speak.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
no,
they
both
went
through
two
murder
trials.
the
first
one
was
a
hung
jury
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
--
was
to
both
of
them.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
and
then
the
second
trial
was
the
second
degree
as
to
meyes,
acquittal
for
douglas
and
then
the
robbery
case.
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
there
is
one
additional
mr.
justice
harlan.
and
that
is
the
most
important.
my
brothers
keep
saying
in
the
opposite
side
that
they
both
--
there's
no
conflict
as
to
all
these
robberies.
there's
a
categorical
denial.
well,
indeed,
that
is
where
the
most
conflict
is
because
i
catalog
--
my
final
argument
just
to
answer
your
question,
the
last
--
the
111
pages,
i
devoted
38
pages
of
my
argument
to
showing
how
these
robberies
never
could
have
taken
place
as
to
douglas,
because
there
was
such
a
lack
of
positive
identification
of
douglas
and
there
was
almost
in
all
instances
a
positive
identification
of
meyes
and
i
went
through
great
lengths
to
contrast.
now,
what
could
have
an
attorney
do
in
this
case
at
bar?
he
could
stay
up
and
stand
up
after
he
has
cross-examined
all
these
witnesses
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
and
say,
“ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
they've
identified
meyes
but
they
were
--
they
never
identified
douglas.
look
how
they
were
impeached
as
to
douglas,
look
how
it
impeached
them
in
the
past
two
trials.”
that
is
where
the
conflict
is
aside
--
in
addition
to
the
two
points
that
you
mentioned
--
mr.
jack
e.
goertzen
thank
you.
