(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
--
would
you
say
that
it's
unreasonable
to
sell
below
cost
where
you're
merely
lowering
your
cost
to
meet
the
price
of
the
competitor?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
thought
it's
saying
that
the
competitor's
business
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
absolutely
that
they
go
to
either
keep
your
business
or
take
away
some
business
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
lower
your
price
below
cost
to
meet
the
price
of
the
competitor
even
though
you're
after
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
say
you
are
doing
it
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
will
you
say
it's
an
unreasonable
--
unreasonably
low
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you're
meeting
his
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
there
were
two
elements
that
were
necessary.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
we
still
have
to
decide
whether
it
was
an
unreasonably
low
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
suggesting
that
it
is
even
though
it's
--
it's
lowered
only
to
meet
the
competitor's
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
these
things
can't
be
kept
in
this
kind
of
categories
when
you're
meeting
some
competitor's
price.
that
just
isn't
a
descriptive
term
or
just
an
isolated
purpose
that
may
very
well
be
for
destroying
the
competitor,
that's
why
you're
meeting
its
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
both
of
them
are
perfectly
consistent
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
him
price
--
meeting
his
price
and
destroying
him
is
perfectly
consistent.
justice
byron
r.
white
especially
if
you
--
in
this
case
--
does
this
record
show
whether
there
was
some
differential
between
the
--
between
the
major's
price
and
the
independent's
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
have
a
--
that
short
circuited
in
communication.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what's
your
final
conclusion
that
you
are
lowering
a
price
below
cost
to
meet
the
price
of
a
competitor
is
reasonable.
that's
an
--
that's
a
reasonable
price,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
combine
it
with
the
purpose
of
destroying
a
competitor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
then
it's
unreasonable
and
violates
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
i
do
not
lower
my
prices
below
cost
but
i
just
have
a
price
that's
a
bit
a
long
way
above
cost,
if
i
combine
that
with
the
purpose
to
destroy
competition,
that
price
--
that
violated
the
section
3
also.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
set
it
on
the
basis
that
i
want
to
destroy
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
going
to
destroy
my
competitor.
let's
assume.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
perhaps
our
difference
really
is
that
when
the
antitrust
division
would
or
wouldn't
say
something
as
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
a
competitor.
you
would
normally
assume
that
someone
intended
the
consequences
of
his
act,
i
suppose.
and
if
you
lower
the
price
to
meet
the
price
of
the
competitor
and
it
destroys
them,
i
would
think
you
might
have
some
trouble
with
your
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
say
that
--
that
--
you
say
that
hard
core
of
this
statute
is
that
this
is
unreasonably
low
--
is
below
cost
and
everyone
knows
that
this
would
be
unreasonably
low,
would
you
also
argue
that
a
--
that
a
fair
measure
of
unreasonableness
is
--
if
the
price
is
discriminatory?
if
you
lower
a
price
and
it
becomes
discriminatory
under
the
robinson-patman
act
that
that
is
a
an
unreasonably
low
price
without
relation
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
let's
assume
that
you
add
to
that
the
purpose
to
destroy
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
discriminatory
price
and
it
violates
section
2
and
it's
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
says
in
one
section
in
another
section
of
the
country,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
was
talking
about
the
same
--
right
the
same
city.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
i
prove
--
if
the
government
proved
its
case,
it
proves
that
a
--
proves
that
there's
a
discriminatory
price,
not
the
same
price
as
the
--
that
they're
selling
across
the
street
for
and
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
that
it's
way
above
the
cost.
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
chadwell.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
you
don't
suggest
that
section
3
hasn't
been
an
important
consideration
in
counseling
the
businessmen
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
lawyers
and
businessmen?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
it
probably
has
been
a
very
important
matter
in
counseling
business
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
can
you
say
--
and
you
suggest
that
selling
below
this
statute
really
gives
no
businessman
or
no
lawyer
a
clear
message
that
selling
below
cost
for
no
reason
of
it
and
to
destroy
competition
is
a
crime.
does
it
--
you
say
that
you
get
no
notice
out
of
the
statute
that
that
is
banned?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
just
--
but
that
isn't
my
question.
my
question
is
--
just
what
i
said
it
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
similar
to
the
question
i
asked
about
meeting
the
price
of
the
competitor.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
so
your
answer
to
the
question
is
apparently
that
the
statute
does
not
give
you
ample
notice
that
selling
below
cost
for
the
single
and
only
purpose
of
destroying
a
competitor
is
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
your
answer
is
that
it
gives
you
no
ample
notice.
