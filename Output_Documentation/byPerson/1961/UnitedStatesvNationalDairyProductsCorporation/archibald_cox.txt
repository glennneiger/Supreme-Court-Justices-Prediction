mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
this
case
is
here
on
a
direct
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
to
the
western
district
of
missouri
dismissing
in
its
seven
counts
of
an
indictment
on
the
ground
that
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
is
so
vague
as
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
provisions
of
section
3
are
set
forth
most
conveniently
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
the
relevant
portions
are
the
first
two
lines
and
then
the
last
three
lines
in
that
big
paragraph.
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
engaged
in
commerce,
in
the
course
of
such
commerce,
to
sell
or
contract
to
sell
goods
at
reasonably
low
prices
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
or
eliminating
a
competitor.
the
indictment
which
was
based
partly
on
that
statute
and
partly
on
the
sherman
act
charged
national
dairy's
one
of
its
officers
with
a
number
of
monopolistic
activities
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
national
dairy
is
the
world's
largest
dairy
concern.
it
has
assets
of
something
over
555
million
and
gross
annual
sales
of
over
a
billion
and
a
half
dollars.
to
conciliate
under
the
sherman
act,
charged
a
continuing
conspiracy
to
restrain
train
by
fixing
prices,
by
excluding
competitors
from
the
market
and
by
fixing
differentials
on
the
prices
for
sales
of
various
kind
of
milk,
that
is
milk
in
containers
as
oppose
to
milk
in
bottles,
milk
in
stores
as
imposed
to
home
deliveries.
those
counts
aren't
before
us,
but
where
a
part
of
the
indictment
and
part
of
the
general
background.
the
seven
counts
under
the
robinson-patman
act
with
which
we
are
immediately
concerned
are
exemplified
by
count
2
on
page
9
of
the
record.
the
offense
charged
leaving
out
the
introductory
allegations
is
set
forth
in
paragraphs
22
and
23
on
page
9.
they
alleged
first
in
the
general
words
of
the
statute
that
national
sold
milk
to
its
distributor
in
the
paola-osawatomie,
kansas
market
at
unreasonably
low
prices
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
in
the
paola-osawatomie
kansas
market
in
violation
of
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
that
paragraph
2
goes
on
and
particularizes
the
event
by
setting
forth
the
facts
of
which
it
consisted.
pursuant
to
an
effect
--
an
effectuation
of
the
offense
charged
from
paragraph
22,
national
utilized
the
advantages
it
posses
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
operates
in
a
great
many
different
geographical
localities.
in
order
to
finance
and
subsidise
the
price
war
against
small
dairies
selling
milk
in
competition
with
it
--
its
distributor
in
the
paola-osawatomie,
kansas
market,
by
intentionally
selling
its
milk
to
its
distributor
market
at
prices
below
national's
cost.
the
latter
paragraph
of
course
limits
the
general
charge
adjust,
as
bill
of
particulars
with
limited
indictment
and
it
framed
in
the
general
terms
of
the
statute.
if
the
government
fails
to
prove
sales
below
cost
then
of
course
at
the
trial,
the
respondent
must
be
acquitted.
so
that
we
deal
here
not
with
the
bear
words
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
abstract
hypothetical
situations
that
with
the
application
of
the
statute
to
sell
at
prices
below
the
seller's
own
cost
made
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition.
the
district
court
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss
upon
the
ground
that
the
relevant
portions
of
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
were
so
vague
and
indefinite
that
they
violate
the
constitutional
provisions
relating
to
due
process.
the
judge
delivered
no
opinion.
his
few
oral
remarks
simply
state
that
conclusion.
a
contrary
decision
i
may
say
was
rendered
by
judge
alger
fee
in
f
&
a
ice
cream
company
against
arden
farms,
the
citation
appears
in
our
brief
and
that
i
believe
is
the
only
other
reported
case
of
the
subject.
the
essence
of
this
case,
as
we
said,
is
very
simple
indeed
and
can
be
put
in
very
few
words.
laying
the
statute
entirely
aside
for
the
moment,
let's
think
of
this
simply
as
a
business
proposition.
suppose
that
this
vast
concern
named
a
manager
for
the
kansas
city
area.
and
later,
the
officers
in
reviewing
prices
observed
that
he
was
selling
milk
and
other
milk
product
at
prices
below
the
cost
of
production.
i
suggest
that
the
officers
of
the
concern
would
have
no
difficulty
in
concluding
just
as
a
business
proposition
that
those
prices
were
unreasonably
low
and
that
unless
the
manager
could
point
to
some
pretty
specific
market
condition,
or
business
exigency
that
explain
this
that
they
would
say
that
prices
were
unreasonably
low.
now,
let's
suppose
he
replied,
“well,
unreasonably
low,
that's
an
awfully
vague
term,
that's
terribly,
terribly
vague.
how
can
you
tell
that
these
prices
are
unreasonably
low?”
if
that
was
his
only
answer,
i
suggest
that
national
would
still
soon
be
looking
for
another
kansas
city
manager
and
that
the
manager
would
soon
be
looking
for
another
job.
all
that
this
statute
does,
now
coming
to
the
legal
question,
is
to
judge
national
by
the
same
terms
that
it
would
judge
its
manager
in
the
kansas
city
area
or
the
chicago
area
or
anywhere
else.
to
put
the
specific
illustration
in
general
words,
we
say
that
the
critical
question
under
this
statute
would
be
whether
the
seller
fix
the
price
in
which
he
sell
the
good
so
low
with
the
specific
intention
of
destroying
competition
or
eliminating
a
competitor
that
the
price
has
no
rational
foundation
in
the
seller's
cost,
or
in
market
conditions,
or
in
any
other
business
exigencies
of
facing
the
seller
of
a
kind
of
a
businessman
without
predatory
intent
would
consider
relevant
in
fixing
his
prices.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
benchmark
the
--
i
would
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
correct.
i'll
explain
the
reason
as
i
go
along.
but
i
would
say
that
the
point
of
view,
if
i
may
put
it
in
those
terms,
because
we
tackle
the
point
of
view
in
determining
negligence
is
from
the
standpoint
of
the
act.
so
the
point
of
view
here,
i
think,
is
from
the
standpoint
of
the
seller,
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that
narrows
the
range
of
this
term
reasonable.
it's
the
seller's
point
of
view
and
the
seller's
own
cost
and
the
standard
would
be
that
of
a
reasonable
businessman
in
the
position
of
the
seller.
of
course,
it's
also
necessary
to
have
the
predatory
intention
is
just
--
not
just
a
matter
of
the
cost
level
alone.
the
government
to
succeed
would
have
to
prove
that
there
was
a
specific
intent
to
destroy
competition
or
eliminate
a
competitor.
i
don't
want
to
leave
out
that
element
which
i
think
confuses
the
whole
statute.
in
--
mr.
archibald
cox
correct.
the
--
going
on
in
more
detail,
the
constitutional
requirement
of
definiteness
in
criminal
statute,
serves
two
familiar
purposes.
first,
it
insures
that
citizens
will
have
an
adequate
opportunity
to
know
what
conduct
is
forbidden
before
they
are
charged
with
crime.
and
second,
it
requires
congress
or
the
legislature
in
the
case
of
the
state
to
resolve
the
questions
of
policy
and
provide
the
court's
juries
with
adequate
rules
by
which
they
can
judge
on
whether
one
is
guilty
or
innocent.
now,
both
elements
are
plainly
met
in
the
present
case.
surely,
no
businessman
reading
section
3
could
have
any
doubt
about
whether
the
prescription
of
sales
at
unreasonably
low
prices
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
or
eliminating
a
competitor,
forbidding
to
sell
goods
at
prices
below
his
own
cost
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
or
eliminating
a
competitor.
here,
as
in
so
many
other
statutes,
the
requirement
of
a
specific
evil
intention
eliminates
any
danger
that
one
would
be
convicted
simply
because
the
jury
or
judge
thought
that
the
prices
were
too
low.
one
who
has
a
purpose
so
at
war
without
historic
antitrust
policy,
certainly
cannot
claim
surprise
innocence
if
the
government
later
proceeds
against
him
for
violating
section
3.
in
this
respect,
i
suggest
the
case
is
exactly
like
united
state
against
regan
where
the
court
held
that
the
term
reasonable
compensation
in
making
deductions
from
the
--
from
one's
gross
income
for
income
tax
purposes
was
not
too
vague
because
the
statute
required
a
proof
of
a
specific
intent
to
defeat
or
evade
the
payment
of
the
tax.
and
similarly
in
hygrade
provision
company
against
sherman
where
the
language
might
otherwise
have
been
too
vague
and
uncertain,
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
saved
by
the
fact
that
there
was
required
proof
of
a
specific
intent
to
defraud.
and
here
we
think
to
repeat
that
the
requirement
of
proof
of
a
specific
intent
to
eliminate
a
competitor
or
to
destroy
competition.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
--
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
it
would,
but
i
think
it's
a
closer
case
than
this
one
because
it
seems
to
me,
what
was
done
here
was
that
instead
of
simply
saying
that
predatory
pricing
should
be
unlawful.
the
congress
put
in
an
additional
safeguard
as
i
see
it
because
it
requires
the
government
--
it
--
it
avoids
or
certainly
reduces
if
not
avoids
entirely,
any
possible
confusion
between
fixing
a
price
which
attracts
business
to
you
and
therefore
away
from
competitor,
and
which
might
standing
alone
give
rise
to
arguments
about
whether
your
purpose
was
to
destroy
competition
or
simply
to
do
business.
this
statute
by
setting
up
another
element
that
the
price
set
must
be
unreasonably
low,
must
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
an
abnormal
price
would
make
it
harder
for
the
government
to
prove
its
case
and
avoid
that
possible
dilemma.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
would
seem
to
be
--
to
be
much
the
same
as
my
second
reason
that
i
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
it
was
--
it
is
desirable
to
have
it
in
order
to
provide
a
rule
by
which
the
finders
of
fact
and
the
judge
shall
make
their
determination
instead
of
simply
leaving
it
to
them
to
decide
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
what's
undesirable.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
standard
which
we
think
would
be
controlling
here
in
each
instance
is
the
standard
of
the
business
community
that
the
statute
refers
as
so
many
statutes
do
to
the
standard
of
the
people
concerned
in
this
line
of
activity.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
but
reading
--
reading
the
statute
were
denied
in
what
it's
seeking
to
achieve
and
in
the
light
of
its
historic
purposes.
it
seems
to
me
that
quite
plainly
is
the
direction
in
which
it
looks
as
i've
indicated
in
answering
justice
stewart
and
the
standard
which
it
incorporates
just
as
the
income
tax
law
incorporate
such
a
standard
in
--
in
dealing
with
deductions
just
as
the
california
statute
dealing
with
driving
in
an
unreasonable
rate
of
speed,
incorporates
the
standard
of
the
ordinary
man
driving
a
motor
vehicle.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
the
shortest
practicable
route
is
the
standard
of
the
trucking
industry
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true
but
i
suggest
here
that
they
are
narrowed
very,
very
considerably.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
certainly
as
--
and
certainly
as
applied
to
this
case,
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
a
price
less
than
cost
with
no
explanation
--
it
could
be
explanations
but
a
price
less
than
cost,
there's
no
explanation
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
is
an
unreasonably
low
price.
mr.
archibald
cox
one
must
find
the
standard
in
the
statute.
but
the
possibility
that
some
other
hypothetical
case
might
raise
difficulties
of
interpretation
is
not
one
that
should
prevent
the
court
from
applying
it
in
the
situation
where
from
the
standpoint
of
the
defendant
the
meaning
was
clear
and
where
in
the
terms
of
the
court
of
jury
applying
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
meaning
was
sufficiently
clear.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
reading
the
statute
in
the
light
of
its
background
and
in
the
light
of
its
subject
ground
even
in
the
cohen
grocery
case.
mr.
chief
justice
taft
clearly
recognized
that
if
the
statute
could
be
given
meaning
by
reference
to
the
practices
of
industry,
or
by
particular
industry,
or
could
be
drawn
--
the
meaning
could
be
drawn
out
of
the
subject
matter
then
that
was
--
it
might
make
sufficient
of
what
simply
as
a
matter
of
etymology
or
an
exercise
--
academic
exercise
in
cost
counting
was
vague.
all
statutes
must
be
read
with
reference
to
their
background
and
purposes.
here,
i
think
that
if
one
looks
at
the
background
and
--
before
i
go
on,
mr.
justice
harlan
have
a
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
have
been
very,
very
few,
very,
very
few.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
have
been
very
--
there
have
been
very,
very
few.
there's
a
case
brought
against
safeway
stores
where
there's
some
dispute
between
the
appellees
and
ourselves
as
to
whether
it
was
based
partly
on
section
3,
but
they
certainly
could
be
counted
on
the
fingers
in
one
hand.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
there
was
a
play
of
nolo
in
this
case
to
which
i
refer.
both
situations,
not
all
mr.
justice
harlan
in
which
section
3
might
be
invoked,
a
prosecution
can
also
be
founded
on
the
sherman
act
and
i
think
that
--
plus
the
fact
that
this
was
noble
and
there
are
somewhat
problems.
i
wouldn't
deny
that
in
the
application
of
section
3,
has
led
the
department
not
to
use
it
widely.
i
would
also
doubt
whether
there
were
many
instances
in
which
one
could
find
sales
at
prices
below
cost
in
circumstances
quite
as
extreme
as
those
charged
in
this
indictment
or
as
we
expect
to
prove.
mr.
archibald
cox
of
course,
the
size
of
the
company
does
not
fix
a
limit
on
who
can
be
prosecuted
and
who
cannot
be
prosecuted.
it's
significant
i
think,
however,
as
part
of
the
background
and
one
of
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment
because
it
helps
us
look
at
what
this
statute
is
aiming
to
do.
this
is
a
statute
which
is
directed
at
dealing
within
historic
problem
for
many,
many
years,
large
concerns
with
sufficient
assets
to
conduct
such
a
campaign
have
found
cutting
prices
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
competitors
or
teaching
those
who
are
unwilling
to
follow
its
price
leadership
a
lesson
so
that
they
will
adhere
to
its
price
leadership
in
--
in
the
future
and
effective
way
of
eliminating
competition.
the
history
of
the
standard
oil
and
tobacco
trust
was
replete
with
instances
of
this
kind.
now,
to
a
considerable
extent
where
you
have
a
combination
in
restraint
of
trade
or
had
monopolization
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
these
problems
were
dealt
with
under
--
under
the
sherman
act.
but
the
sherman
act
contains
no
specific
provision
directed
at
--
and
its
specific
anti-competitive
prac
--
practices
before
that
degree
of
monopoly
or
restraint
had
been
achieved.
then
came
the
clayton
act
which
is
your
honor
of
course,
the
members
attempted
to
particularize.
and
one
of
the
things
that
it
was
directed
at
was
on
a
discriminatory
price
cutting
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
competition.
this
provision
turned
out
to
have
--
to
be
inadequate
in
the
eyes
of
congress.
and
in
1936,
the
robinson-patman
act
attempted
to
tighten.
and
again,
to
feel
more
specifically
with
this
predatory
price
cutting,
some
of
the
provisions
as
the
court
recognized
in
moore
against
mead's
fine
bread
were
drawn
so
as
to
prevent
a
big
company
like
this,
from
using
the
profits
that
it
made
in
interstate
sales
to
finance
local
price
wars,
and
they
--
they
designed
to
eliminate
small
businessmen.
discriminate
not
all
the
instances
of
this
kind,
fall
under
the
rubric
discrimination.
for
example,
there
are
many
markets
dealt
is
typically
one
of
them
in
which
the
price
is
so
affected
by
local
conditions
that
one
could
in
fact
sell
at
a
lower
price
in
a
particular
market
and
subsidize
that
as
sales
below
cost
in
that
market
out
of
the
profits
he
made
and
some
others
without
it's
being
possible
to
prove
discrimination.
or
he
might
produce
his
price
on
a
single
product,
adds
the
low
cost
as
it's
charged
here
and
subsidize
the
loss
by
the
profits
he
made
on
the
other
product.
those
practices
are
just
as
predatory,
just
as
anti-competitive
and
i
submit
just
as
easily
identifiable
as
the
predatory
practices
involving
price
discrimination.
it's
evident
that
this
is
what
congress
was
seeking
to
deal
with.
and
that
the
--
the
knowledge
of
the
evil
that
it
was
seeking
the
remedy
not
only
helps
to
identify
the
general
area
in
which
the
statute
falls
but
i
suggest
that
it
does
fix
the
point
of
view,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
it
does
make
it
plain
that
we
come
at
this
from
the
standpoint
of
the
fact
--
the
problems
facing
the
seller.
certainly,
we
don't
as
in
--
might
have
been
argued
in
the
cases
under
the
labor
act,
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
prices
--
of
the
situation
facing
the
buyer.
after
all
and
accept
as
he
may
see
through
the
eyes
of
others,
no
price
from
his
standpoint
is
unreasonably
low.
i
think
it
is
also
plain
that
we're
not
interested
in
some
average
cost
because
the
theory
of
the
antitrust
laws
of
which
this
is
apart
is
that
the
effect
is
to
encourage
a
firm
if
it
--
to
reduce
its
prices
and
give
the
consumers
the
best
buy
for
their
money,
even
if
this
does
hurt
some
marginal
firm.
it's
one
when
--
one
gets
an
artificially
low
price,
a
price
which
has
no
business
justification
and
that
price
coupled
with
the
predatory
intent
that
the
policy
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
violated
because
of
the
long
run
damage.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
might
even
be
selling
somewhat
above
cost.
mr.
archibald
cox
is
abnormal
--
is
so
small
that
no
business
could
long
be
surviving.
now,
there
may
be
instances
where
selling
below
cost
would
be
justified.
my
contention
stated
more
precisely
is
that
sales
below
cost
for
this
purpose
without
some
business
explanation
are
clearly
unreasonably
low.
but
the
business
explanation
are
readily
identifiable
to
go
back
to
my
hypothetical
case
of
the
manager
if
he
were
able
to
show
his
employers
that
by
selling
it
what
was
below
his
current
cost,
he
was
getting
rid
of
a
spoiled
milk
and
--
which
he
otherwise
would
have
to
throw
away,
this
would
make
the
price
reasonable.
if
he
were
showing
that
he
had
reason
as
judge
merrill
recognized
in
one
of
the
private
suits
before
the
carnation
milk
case.
if
he
were
selling
at
a
price
which
was
below
his
current
cost,
but
which
he
could
show
at
a
reasonably
anticipated
volume
would
then
be
--
would
then
yield
him
a
reasonable
profit
and
that
he
had
reduced
the
price
to
raise
his
volume
and
spread
his
overhead
cost
over
a
larger
number
of
units,
that
too
in
the
eyes
of
a
businessman
and
the
position
of
the
seller
would
make
this
reasonable.
and
we
think
it
would
make
it
reasonable
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
not
bringing
our
brief
your
honor.
i
must
confess
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
5
--
i'm
afraid
i
just
can't
comment
on
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
the
reasonable
--
mr.
archibald
cox
(voice
overlap)growing
wage
in
--
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'd
--
i
do
remember
the
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
not
cited
--
it's
not
cited
in
either
brief.
and
when
i
read
it,
i
had
doubt
frankly
whether
the
case
was
the
one
that
would
be
followed
today.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
i
do
think
that
there
is
this
that
this
is
a
question
of
which
involves
a
knowledge
of
what
are
wages
--
what
are
wages
in
the
community.
it
may
be
much
harder
to
identify
the
wage
in
a
community
that
it
is
to
identify
the
--
well,
but
this
is
often
true
with
all
difference
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
does
it
prevail,
well
--
just
excuse
me,
i
simply
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what
is
a
--
the
prevailing
rate
of
wage
does
not
put
this
in
terms
of
anybody's
point
of
view.
now,
if
you
go
in
to
the
wages
in
the
construction
industry
of
the
philadelphia
locality,
you
may
find
that
for
operating
--
well
operating
engineers
--
many
classifications
for
carpenters
that
there
are
10
different
wage
rates
being
paid
by
different
concern
which
is
the
prevailing
one.
there
may
be
--
this
happens
all
the
time.
there
may
be
20%
of
the
employers
are
paying
carpenters
$2.75.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
no,
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
excuse
me,
i
took
carpenters
because
this
is
not
a
trade
in
which
they
are
divided
in
terms
of
skill.
carpenters
for
the
most
part
are
carpenters.
and
the
same
thing
would
be
true
of
laborers
or
qualified
electricians
where
you
have
a
lot
of
small
employer.
you
have
--
under
the
devastation
act.
this
is
frequently
a
very
difficult
problem.
and
you
have
a
lot
of
different
prevailing
wages.
the
coming
of
unions
has
of
course
tended
to
stabilize
it
at
a
particular
rate.
but
here,
it
decides
which
is
prevailing.
the
economist
had
never
--
as
a
matter
of
theory
been
able
to
work
this
out.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
devastation
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
--
both
of
those
provide
--
both
of
those
provide
for
a
determination
by
an
administrative
authority.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
oh,
i'm
not
seeking
to
defend
the
ruling
in
the
connally
case.
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
i
am
trying
to
suggest
that
the
problem
of
selecting
which
of
perhaps
half
a
dozen
or
eight
different
rates
are
paid
in
no
case
to
as
many
as
the
majority
of
the
employees
is
prevailing.
it's
quite
different
from
deciding
whether
a
sale
at
a
price
below
the
seller's
own
cost
is
unreasonably
low,
especially
when
it
is
coupled
with
the
intent
to
destroy
competition.
i
submit
that
the
cases
are
readily
distinguished
book
on
the
--
on
the
ground
of
practicalities
of
the
kind
of
judgment
called
from.
might
i
say
just
one
thing
further
that
the
--
in
this
case,
the
logical
conclusion
of
the
appellee's
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
the
congress
is
powerless
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
predatory
activity.
neither
the
appellee
nor
anyone
else
has
suggested
any
formulation
more
precise
than
the
one
in
the
statute
here.
and
this
is
the
one
which
the
canadian
parliament
followed
and
others.
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
take
into
account
therefore
if
to
be
any
doubt
what
mr.
justice
black
said
in
the
petrillo
case
and
that
is
that
the
constitution
does
not
raise
impossible
hurdles
to
legislation.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
on
its
face
has
two
different
meanings
which
is
important
to
distinguish
here.
i
think
ought
to
the
extent
that
on
its
face,
means
that
one
must
find
the
standard
in
the
statute
itself
or
in
some
business
standard
of
the
business
community,
the
relevant
community
or
that
the
statute
incorporates,
then
it
must
be
judged
that
way.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
is
reasonably
plain
as
applied
to
this
defendant
and
the
conduct
in
which
he
engaged
and
that
the
hypothetical
cases
about
somebody
else's
conduct
that
somebody
else
might
engage
in
are
not
before
the
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
then
the
government
would
be
bound
to
that
and
the
court
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
you
would
judge
it
in
the
later
bill
of
particulars.
and
i
think
this
expressions
that
we
determine
the
meaning
of
the
statute
on
its
face
which
are
very
common
in
the
opinion
means
that
the
standard
as
applied
--
that
the
standard
must
be
found
to
the
statute.
that
--
but
standard
as
applied
to
something
and
i
say
that's
the
--
as
applied
to
the
case
made
in
the
indictment
and
that
is
the
case
named
the
indictment
is
exactly
the
one
that
your
honors
followed.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
essentially
what
was
done
by
the
court
in
the
harris
case,
the
one
involving
the
lobbying
act
wherein
some
of
its
applications
the
anti-lobbying
act
might
have
been
unconstitutionally
vague,
limited
to
direct
approaches
to
congressmen.
it
was
held
sufficiently
to
decide.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
had
been
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
this
is
the
first
one,
but
it
is
very
nearly
the
first.
