suppose
--
suppose
the
statute,
instead
of
being
in
its
present
term
left
out
at
unreasonably
low
prices,
simply
made
it
a
crime
to
sell
goods
at
a
price
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
--
at
any
price
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition.
what
i
have
in
mind,
suppose
a
concern
comes
into
a
market
in
which
it
hasn't
been
theretofore
and
sells
it
as
a
--
what
might
be
called
an
unreasonably
high
price
in
order
to
make
people
feel
that
the
true
value,
if
you
want
this
kind
of
goods,
you
got
to
pay
a
price
for
it
and
that
people
are
now
selling
it
at
a
much
lower
price
are
really
as
it
were
skimping
or
cheating
you
or
otherwise
giving
you
less
--
giving
you
meretricious
commodity,
would
that
be
alright?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
as
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
take
it
as
a
third
reason
against
vagueness
in
criminal
statute
and
that
is
that
you
shouldn't
leave
too
much
room
for
variance
determination
by
juries
throughout
the
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
third
suggestion
is
different.
the
vagueness
maybe
the
juries
wouldn't
know
what
to
do.
but
my
third
suggestion,
my
third
reason
against
vagueness
is
that
you'd
have
a
jury
in
--
in
boston,
make
one
--
have
one
standard
in
its
head
and
the
jury
in
pittsburgh
another
standard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
say
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
depends
on
how
many
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
depends
on
how
many
variant
factors
are
implied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
statute
itself
is
vague
and
you
resend
this
particular
case,
there's
no
trouble?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no
hypothetically
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
hypothetical
harsh
case,
but
the
standards
must
be
drawn
from
the
terms
of
the
statute
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
be
vindicated
by
the
specific
fact
for
the
particular
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
speak
--
you
lay
the
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
vast
organization.
what's
the
relevance
of
that?
if
the
statute
had
said
in
case
of
enterprises
having
a
turnover
of
x
hundred
millions
or
$20,000,000,
i
could
see
that
would
be
a
hedging
in.
that
would
tell
you
some
implications
with
it,
namely
that
you
have
means
of
comparison.but
this
statute
isn't
so
restricted
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr
solicitor
general,
i
like
to
--
i
have
it
of
disclosing
my
difficulty
in
this
case
--
and
my
difficulty
in
this
case
is
a
case
to
which
you
don't
even
refer
your
belief,
connally
commission
against
general
construction
company.
i
might
say
i
was
surprised
at
the
time
that
sitting
with
--
that
case
was
decided,
but
i
shall
think
you
have
a
good
hurdle
to
get
over
in
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
closest
case
that's
involved
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
in
269
u.s.
385.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
read
you
the
statute
which
as
i've
said,
i've
indicated.
i
thought
that
was
strange
decision.
there,
imposed
punishments
upon
contractors
who
pay
their
workmen
less
than
(voice

justice
felix

the
current
production
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
current
on
wages
in
the
locality
where
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
rest
had
performed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
cited
in
the
brief
to
my
great
surprise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
going
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
not
referring
to
it,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

wages
in
the
locality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
unreasonable
below?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
you
equate
--
equate
working
function
to
working
function
--
in
working
function.
in
other
words,
the
prevailing
rate
of
wages
of
carpenters
is
one
thing
and
particular
kind
of
carpenters
of
any
rate
of
wages
of
plumbers
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
--
professor
is
another
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
there's
a
statute
which
now
--
what
is
it,
the
miller
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
walsh-healey
act
--
the
walsh-healey
act
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
but
if
it
can't
be
determined,
how
can
he
determine
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
he
better
than
a
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
defend
it
but
you
have
to
meet
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
we
decided
the
contrary
in
screws?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
the
solicitor
general
argued
is
that
unreasonably
low
means
having
no
economic
or
business
justification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
whole
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
price
leader,
the
whole
--
the
whole
--
whole
of
fair
trade
statute
on
that
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
suppose
the
department
gives
you
the
comfort
that
--
justice
holmes
gave
comfort
in
the
nash
case
that
would
--
well
that's
what
a
fair-headed
reasonably
minded
juries
will
take
care
of.
