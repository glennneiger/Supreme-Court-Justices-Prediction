i
thought
that
you
answered
mr.
justice
white
to
the
effect
that
a
price
which
was
lower
to
meet
a
competitors
price
and
which
was
below
cost
and
which
i
have
behind
that
in
the
purpose
of
destroying
that
competitor's
competition
would
not
violate
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
practice
that
the
generation
so
ago,
henry
ford
adopted
if
have
it
right,
he
reduced
his
prices
below
cost.
this
was
considered
by
the
traditional
conventional
business
community
as
something
not
only
highly
unreasonable
but
radical
and
unheard
of
and
revolutionary
and
he
did
so
in
order
to
increase
the
volume
which
would
end
up
if
he
succeeded
as
in
fact
he
did
succeed
by
making
the
big
profit
but
he
reduced
his
current
prices
below
their
current
cost.

and

the
jury
would
have
thought
he
was
crazy.
the
business

did.
justice

i
think
--
don't
you
think?
well,
i
don't
know
the
history
and
perhaps
you
know
it
better
than
i
do.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
he
was
not
doing
this
in
order
to
help
his
competitors.
