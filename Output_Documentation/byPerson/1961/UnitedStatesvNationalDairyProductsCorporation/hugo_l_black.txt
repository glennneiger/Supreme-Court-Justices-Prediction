justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
that
not
applicable
to
the
antitrust
law
as
construed
in
the
standard
oil
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
have
to
have
fraud?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
make
in
a
more
definite
--
accurate
definition
of
it
than
it's
made
here
with
reference
to
prices?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
--
what
would
--
what
--
what
would
you
suggest
would
be
the
difference
in
the
court
charged
to
the
jury
in
defining
what
--
asking
him
to
decide
whether
it's
been
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade,
and
asking
him
to
decide
it
whether
there's
been
unreasonable
price?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
i
was
just
trying
to
see
if
we
could
capture
the
idea
here,
the
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
maybe
there
is
--
maybe
it's
enough
just
to
say
common
law
used
a
lot
of
words
about
what
was
restraint
of
trade.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
tell
a
layman
on
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
that's
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
distinguished
from
telling
him
whether
there's
been
an
unreasonable
price.
now,
my
--
my
question
that
i
asked
you
is
indicating
any
view
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
intend
it
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you
buy
in
some
groceries,
let
it
be
known
that
they
are
charging
you
200%
profit
on
items
that
--
not
much
trouble
to
handle.
would
that
--
would
you
say
it's
impossible
for
you
to
bring
about
--
think
about
what's
an
unreasonable
price?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you're
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
to
the
difficulty.
i
was
asking
you
if
there's
any
similar
difficulty
in
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
either
way,
you
don't
have
to
meet
that
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
problem
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
could
say,
couldn't
it,
below
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you've
been
arguing,
below
cost.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
think
it
contains
much
more
difference
as
my
brother
harlan
is
suggesting
below
cost.
i
would
think
probably
that
the
--
to
meet
the
standards,
that's
not
what
we
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
have
to
look
--
do
they
have
to
determine
much
of
the
general
attitude
about
competitors
or
special
competitors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
an
idea
that
at
least
in
country
merchants,
the
dream
of
all
of
this
to
reduce
a
competitor
as
much
as
they
can,
that
they
would
not
be
unhappy
if
their
competition
reduced
their
competitors
to
a
lower
number.
you
have
--
you
have
quite
a
problem
there
when
you
start
at
that
mode
because
maybe
one
of
the
objects
of
competitive
system
is
if
the
other
--
one
man
will
try
to
do
so
good
and
do
so
well
that
he'll
drive
the
others
out
of
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
we
hope
he
can't
do
it
and
that's
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
motive
of
--
motive
of
all
revenue
is
very
much
alike,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
you're
--
you're
putting
them
on
that
much
of
parody,
do
you?
you
may
be
shaking
some
of
your
followers.
if
you
say
it's
just
as
definite
to
say
that
it's
unreasonable
as
it
is
to
say
that
it's
below
cost.
now,
i
understand
you
put
them
on
a
parody.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
do
so
in
my
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
law
wouldn't
have
to
--
it
could
pass
the
law
saying
you
shall
not
sell
at
below
cost.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
also
that
that
is
declared
unreasonable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
constitution
requires
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
merchant
goes
out
to
buy
a
lot
of
clothing
and
he
at
least
some
of
them
did
it
and
they
pay
so
much
per
suit
of
clothes.
that's
what
the
suit
or
clothes
cost
him.
you're
not
talking
about
the
cost
of
that
during
business
but
the
suit
or
clothes
cost
them
$40.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
now
about
the
merchant
who
has
bought
it
and
it's
cost
him
$40
per
suit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
the
law
have
said
that
if
he
sold
it
below
cost
that
wouldn't
be
--
couldn't
be
held
to
that
$40
that
he
paid
for
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
just
what
he
paid
for.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
intend
to
divert
you
because
we
don't
have
that
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
here,
i
think
we
have
quite
a
different
case.
