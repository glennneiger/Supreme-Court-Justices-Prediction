mr.
john
t.
chadwell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
not
a
word
in
this
statute
which
is
before
the
court
or
consideration
about
sale
below
cost.
i
think
it
well
at
the
outset
of
my
remarks
to
remind
the
court
of
that
fact.
the
statute
provides
against
sales
at
unreasonably
low
prices.
those
are
the
words
of
the
statute.
now,
we
contend
and
of
this
urge
in
our
brief
that
if
the
unreasonably
low
price
provision
of
the
statute
is
considered
on
its
face
in
line
with
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
obviously
is
unconstitutional
under
a
long
line
of
decision
starting
with
cohen
--
the
cohen
grocery
case.
the
term
unreasonably
low
price
or
the
unreasonably
high
price
or
unreasonable
price,
the
latter
of
which
was
held
unconstitutional
in
the
--
in
the
cohen
case
is
indefinite
now
as
it
was
when
those
cases
was
--
were
decided.
the
term
unreasonably
low
price
has
no
ascertainable
meaning.
it
has
no
definition
in
law,
in
custom
or
in
the
business
society
which
gives
it
any
meaning
whatsoever.
now
the
court
said
that
in
the
cohen
case.
they
repeated
it
in
cline
against
frink
dairy
company.
they
referred
to
it
again
as
a
rule
of
law
in
the
connally
case
to
which
incidentally
our
brief
refers
four
different
times.
the
solicitor
general
was
in
error
in
that
case.
we
do
rely
in
part
on
the
connally
case
as
well
as
these
other
cases.
and
i
strongly
urge
that
upon
the
face
of
the
statute
and
the
decided
cases
of
this
court,
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
the
district
court
held.
now
as
the
solicitor
general
said,
“this
is
the
first
time
the
statute
has
been
before
this
court
in
the
criminal
case.”
this
is
a
criminal
case.
mr.
wise,
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
case,
an
individual
defendant,
was
entitled
to
notice
in
the
statute
not
for
the
first
time
in
the
indictment
that
doesn't
satisfy
the
vagueness
requirements
of
the
constitution.
he
was
entitled
to
notice
in
the
statute
as
to
what
he
had
to
do
to
comply
with
the
law.
that
is
the
due
process
clause
in
the
fifth
amendment.
that
is
the
notice
requirement
in
the
six
amendment
and
as
this
court
has
said
a
number
of
times
and
as
the
solicitor
general
virtually
admits
here
today,
he
must
find
that
standard
and
that
definition
in
the
statute.
and
if
he
gets
it
for
the
first
time
in
the
indictment,
which
is
what
the
solicitor
general
is
arguing
here
today,
the
provisions
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment
are
a
sham
in
a
delusion.
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
the
cardiff
case,
he
is
entitled
to
it
in
the
statute
itself.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
say
that
not
only
is
the
unreasonably
low
price
clause,
unconstitutional
or
indefiniteness
and
vagueness
as
this
court
had
said,
but
it
cannot
be
saved
by
the
intent
provision
of
the
statute.
if
these
were
saved
by
the
intent
provision
of
the
statute
as
the
solicitor
general
has
argued,
then
you'll
read
the
first
requirement
right
out
of
the
act.
the
act
provides
two
elements
of
an
offense.
the
first
element
of
an
offense
is
to
sell
at
unreasonably
low
prices.
now,
what
standard
is
set
up
by
that
provision?
i
say
there
is
no
standard
set
up
by
that
provision
and
so
as
the
court
so
held.
now,
what
does
the
solicitor
general
argued?
he
argues
oh
well
--
oh
well,
i'm
not
--
don't
want
to
talk
too
much
about
the
unreasonably
low
price
clause.
but
there
is
an
anticompetitive
intent
requirement
in
the
statute.
but
this
court
has
held
--
all
seven
justices
held
when
the
subject
of
intent
was
discussed
in
the
--
in
the
screws
case.
all
seven
justices
are
writing
separate
opinions
in
this
case
held
that
the
element
of
definiteness
required
by
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
cannot
be
supplied
by
intent.
if
so,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
indicated
in
his
question
to
the
solicitor
general,
all
you
need
to
say
would
be
“any
act
done,
any
act
done
by
a
person
with
the
intent
our
purpose
of
hindering
or
lessening
competition
would
be
sufficiently
valid
under
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment,”
and
no
court
has
ever
held
that.
now,
what
does
the
government
say,
and
i
might
before
passing
on
to
this
next
point,
i
want
to
make
this
observation
that
the
government
apparently
at
the
time
this
appeal
was
taken,
thought
that
this
case
should
be
determined
as
it
was
in
the
lower
court
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
not
through
any
limitation
--
limitation
in
the
indictment,
for
in
the
notice
of
appeal
in
this
case
after
we
want
it
in
the
lower
court.
the
question
stated
by
the
government
to
be
presented
by
the
appeal
was
whether
or
not
the
unreasonably
low
price
provision
of
section
3
was
a
violation
of
--
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
to
the
constitution.
it
was
not
until
they
filed
their
jurisdictional
statement
and
briefed
the
subject
that
they
tried
to
narrow
the
issue
before
this
court
to
the
cost
question.
now,
let
us
discuss
the
cost
question.
the
solicitor
general
argues
in
effect.
we
don't
have
to
defend
this
statute
on
its
face.
we
don't
have
to
defend
the
statute
on
the
word
that
congress
chose
to
enact
namely
unreasonably
low
prices.
we
defend
the
statute
on
a
ground
that
at
least
--
at
least
such
language
means
sales
below
cost.
at
least,
it
prohibits
sales
below
cost.
well
now,
in
the
first
place,
we
deny
that
you
can
equate
the
term
unreasonably
low
prices
with
the
term
sales
below
cost.
there
are
many,
many
instances
as
in
and
aside
the
solicitor
general
stated
in
his
oral
argument.
there
are
many
instances
when
no
one
could
possibly
say
that
a
sale
below
cost
could
be
predatory
in
any
sense,
could
be
unreasonable,
it
could
be
an
unreasonably
low
price.
many
instances
as
they
admit
in
their
brief
such
as
sales
of
excess
inventory,
such
as
sales
of
merchandise
is
not
going
very
well,
all
sorts
of
things
of
that
kind.
but
there
are
many
others
of
prices
fixed
in
advance
of
the
fact.
you
don't
know
what
your
cost
are
until
the
transaction
is
completed.
every
cost
and
every
accounting
system
in
the
land
is
based
upon
cost
after
the
transactions
have
occurred.
there's
no
one
who
knows
in
advance
what
his
cost
is
going
to
be,
why?
it
happens
constantly
with
an
efficient
operation.
it
happens
constantly
with
efficient
operations
that
after
a
sale
has
been
made,
it
is
then
determined
for
the
first
time
that
the
sale
was
below
cost.
let
us
assume
that
a
business
organization
projects
a
certain
volume
over
a
certain
period,
and
upon
the
basis
of
that
project
--
projection,
they
established
a
certain
price,
would
it
develops
during
the
course
of
the
--
of
the
period
of
sale
that
they
were
wrong
and
how
much
they
were
going
to
sell
or
and
if
their
volume
fell
way
below
what
they
anticipated.
or
that
they
were
wrong
in
what
their
cost
were
going
to
be,
because
of
efficiencies
or
inefficiencies
that
develop
in
the
course
of
operation
or
manufacture.
that
sale
turns
out
to
be
below
cost.
could
anyone
say
that
that
act
was
an
unreasonable
act?
that
that
price
was
an
unreasonable
price?
and
the
only
way
the
solicitor
general
suggests
to
this
court
that
you
could
save
that
situation
is
by
the
intent
clause.
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
you
held
over
and
over
again
that
you
can't
save
an
act
by
the
intent
clause
where
--
where
it
submits
or
--
or
outlines
or
states
any
indefinite
standard
in
the
first
place.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
your
honor,
i
--
i
recognize
the
--
the
--
the
force
of
your
honor's
comment
but
i
said
this,
that
in
screws,
both
in
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
douglas
and
in
the
opinion
written
by
your
honor,
in
which
seven
--
in
both
of
which
seven
justices
joined,
i
think
you
will
find
and
i
can
stop
and
read
--
read
the
portions
out.
but
they're
cited
in
our
brief.
i
think
you
will
find
that
in
both
opinions,
all
seven
justices
agreed
to
the
statement
that
i
have
just
made
that
a
--
an
unreas
--
that
an
indefinite
standard
or
the
lack
of
the
--
of
the
standard
cannot
be
supplied
by
intent.
and
your
honor
did
distinguish
a
number
of
cases
which
have
been
cited
to
the
contrary
effect
on
the
ground
that
the
language
used.
there
were
makeweight
--
it
was
makeweight
language
that
the
court
had
held
in
already
that
there
was
a
sufficiently
definite
standard
and
pointed
out
in
addition
that
there
was
a
predatory
intent
or
criminal
intent
required.
why
your
honor,
if
--
if
intent,
if
intent
could
supply
a
needed
deficiency
in
an
indefinite
standard,
the
cohen
case
wouldn't
have
been
decided
the
way
it
was
because
that
required
willful
intent
to
sell
at
unreasonable
price.
the
frink
case
would
not
have
been
decided
the
way
it
was,
because
it
is
also
requiring
sale
at
an
--
with
a
wilful
intent.
the
same
thing
was
true
in
the
--
in
the
cramp
case
which
the
court
decided
only
last
december
as
--
as
an
invalid
statute,
because
of
a
failure
to
define
the
acts
forbidden.
and
that
was
the
case
in
which
intent
was
specified,
a
wilful
intent
to
violate
the
law,
and
that
did
not
save
that
statute.
i
think
that
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
has
made
that
very
clear
if
the
court
please
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
in
screws
to
the
contrary.
in
fact,
i
contend
as
i
have
said
that
all
seven
justices
in
the
two
opinions
to
which
i
refer
are
recognized
that
fact
as
a
rule
of
law.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
say
they
can
legislate
in
this
field
if
they
desire
to
do
it,
if
the
court
please,
and
i
--
and
i
want
to
--
and
i
want
to
state
this
which
the
solicitor
general
has
ignored
and
which
their
brief
ignores
although
we
have
covered
the
point
at
quite
some
length.
30
different
states,
30
different
states
have
adopted
sales
below
cost
statutes.
now,
assuming
that
the
congress
desired
to
legislate
in
the
sales
below
cost
field,
they
could
easily
say
sales
below
cost.
they
wouldn't
have
to
say
unreasonably
low
pricing.
the
legislative
history
shows
they
didn't
mean
to
say
sales
below
cost.
they
didn't
say
sales
below
cost,
but
30
different
states
of
legislation
in
that
field.now,
what
have
they
done?
they
have
prohibited
sales
below
cost
and
they
have
defined
what
cost
means.
now,
these
definitions
vary,
i
must
say
that
greatly
between
the
various
states.
but
there
has
been
a
standard
of
definition.
they
have
state
adjust
--
just
what
--
just
how
cost
should
be
computed.
now,
the
very
fact
that
those
statutes
had
varied
greatly
as
between
the
various
state
is
proved,
it
seems
to
us,
that
there
is
no
ascertainable
standard
from
the
word
cost
itself.
and
that
if
you
get
by
the
point
which
i
have
strongly
urged
to
the
court
that
you
cannot
equate
unreasonably
low
prices
and
--
and
sales
below
cost.
if
you
get
by
that
and
say,
“well,
we
will
interpret
the
statute
as
meaning
sales
below
cost”
then
i
say,
“you've
got
no
better
standard
than
you
have
before.”
the
solicitor
says
“well,
anybody
knows
he
shouldn't
--
shouldn't
sell
below
his
own
cost,
and
certainly
the
statute
at
least
means
that.”
well,
the
indictment
says
that,
but
congress
didn't
say
that.
the
indictment
or
congress
either
one,
doesn't
supply
or
indicate
what
cost
means
if
we
go
to
the
literature
and
define
what
cost
means,
we
find
the
cost
being
defined
every
which
way
and
great
disagreement
on
the
subject
according
to
the
--
the
authorities
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
and
this
court
in
the
automatic
canteen
case
recognized
the
illusory
nature
of
the
term
and
referred
to
it
in
connection
with
that
case
which
was
of
course
justification
case
under
section
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
now,
let
us
assume
that
the
--
that
the
term
unreasonably
low
prices
should
be
considered
to
mean
sales
below
the
defendants
cost
--
the
defendants
cost.
let's
narrow
it
that
much.
so,
although
the
statute
does
not
do
so,
no
definition
of
cost
does
so.
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
question,
“does
cost
mean
the
defendants
cost
or
does
it
means
average
cost?”
we
will
look
to
the
statute
in
vain
for
an
answer
to
that
question
because
the
statute
doesn't
even
say
cost.
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
department
of
justice
was
called
upon
by
the
house
committee
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
just
in
1960,
to
advice
with
them
concerning
a
bill
pending
before
congress
which
have
been
introduced
by
representative
patman
in
an
effort
to
define
the
term
unreasonably
low
cost
--
unreasonably
low
price
which
was
in
that
bill,
which
would
have
given
to
the
federal
trade
commission
the
right
to
determine
unreasonably
low
prices
and
a
--
and
the
trouble
damage
plaintiff
to
sue
for
damages
resulting
from
sales
at
unreasonably
low
prices.
in
effect,
it
was
a
bill
to
send
aside
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
nashville
milk
case.
and
in
that
--
in
that
bill
which
was
introduced
by
representative
patman
in
1960,
there
was
an
attempt
made
to
define
the
term
unreasonably
low
price
and
among
other
definitions
in
there
was
selling
below
cost
and
then
the
--
the
sales
below
cost
was
defined.
and
it
was
defined
in
this
way.
it
was
defined
to
say,
first
it
means,
cost
is
defined
in
any
state
sales
below
cost
statute
which
might
be
applicable
in
the
state
where
they
say
it
was
made.
second,
in
the
absence
of
such
a
statute,
it
should
be
defined
as
a
sale
at
a
price
less
than
the
cost
of
manufacturing,
packaging
and
selling
a
commodity
with
the
payment
of
such
transportation
cost
as
they're
born
for
the
producers
and
then
they
go
on
plus
overhead
and
other
cost
of
the
vendor
doing
business.
well,
the
department
of
justice
was
called
upon
to
comment
upon
this
bill.
and
the
department
said
that
it
carries
overall
of
the
ambiguities
and
uncertainties
of
the
unreasonably
low
price
cost
of
section
3.
we
quote
this
letter
in
our
brief.
and
furthermore,
that
the
--
that
the
definition
is
given,
gives
rise
to
a
great
many
ambiguities
and
uncertainties
and
there
will
be
great
dispute
over
what
this
terms
mean,
which
i
urged
to
the
court
is
an
admission
by
the
department
of
justice
itself
that
even
if
you
try
to
define
cost
a
little
more
than
just
saying
cost
and
in
the
matter
that
was
done
in
the
patman
bill.
that
man
of
intelligence
as
stated
the
connally
case.
man
of
intelligence
must
guess
as
to
its
meaning
and
differs
to
--
as
to
its
application.
and
since
that
is
necessary,
there's
no
standard
for
this
--
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
now,
i
might
say
that
we
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
--
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
your
honor,
it
was
decided
in
nash
of
course,
that
the
term
unreasonably
low
--
or
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
furnished
a
sufficient
standard
through
the
common
law
meaning
of
the
term
to
satisfy
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
and
the
--
and
this
court,
the
supreme
court
in
cline
against
frink
dairy
distinguished
the
nash
case
from
the
unreasonable
profit
case
which
was
submitted
to
the
court
there
up
on
that
ground.
there's
no
doubt
that
words
that
have
a
general
meaning
of
the
common
law
such
as
restraint
of
trade
or
a
general
meaning
through
custom
or
through
business
--
business
ethics
as
in
the
regan
case
which
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to
which
the
court
equated
with
fraud.
there's
no
doubt
that
is
sufficient
standard
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
it
doesn't
have
to
have
fraud
your
honor
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
unreasonable
rest
--
no,
no,
i
was
saying
as
a
second
--
as
a
second
element
or
second
category
of
cases.
no,
the
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
statute,
sherman
act,
was
upheld
in
the
nash
case
on
the
ground
that
restraint
of
trade
or
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
was
well-enough
known
at
the
common
law
for
a
sufficient
standard.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
say
to
the
court,
mr.
justice
black,
that
there's
quite
a
difference
between
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
which
has
a
common
law
meaning
and
a
well-accepted
meaning,
and
unreasonably
low
prices
which
has
no
meaning
at
the
common
law,
in
business
or
custom
or
society
at
all.
and
it
was
--
because
of
that
difference
which
i
have
just
stated
that
the
court
in
the
--
in
cline
against
frink
held
to
be
invalid.
the
statute
there
which
provided
for
permissible
--
which
provided
against
combinations
in
restraint
of
trade
provide
that
reasonable
profits
or
satisfaction
would
not
be
illegal,
the
only
combination
which
resulted
in
a
reasonable
profit.
the
court
said
reasonable
profits
is
meaningless
and
they
distinguished
the
antitrust
or
the
nash
case
on
the
ground
that
in
that
case
there
was
a
--
an
established
common
law
meaning.
but
i
say
permissible
general
terms
can
be
put
in
statutes
of
course
even
if
they
have
no
common
law
meaning
if
they
have
a
well-accepted
business
meaning,
or
well-accepted
meaning
otherwise
such
as
fraud
--
a
faking
of
--
or
patting
of
business
expenses.
the
court
said
in
regan,
“everybody
knows
whether
he
has
truly
stated
his
expenses
or
not,
and
what
is
forbidden
in
the
act
is
falsifying
expenses.”
there
is
--
that
furnishes
a
sufficient
standard
and
that
--
and
the
--
the
act
was
upheld.
i
say
it's
a
very
different
thing
for
the
reasons
which
i
have
stated
from
the
--
from
a
unreasonably
low
price
prohibition
when
there's
absolutely
no
standard
of
any
kind
which
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
think
the
very
easy
restraint
--
charge
a
jury
on
unreasonably
restraint
of
trade
on
the
basis
of
many,
many
instructions
has
been
given
over
a
period
of
many
years.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
there
is
a
very
well-accepted
meaning
for
restraint
of
trade.
there's
no
question
about
that.
there
is
no
well-accepted
meaning
for
unreasonable
price
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
how
can
you?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
understand
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
understand
sir.
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
to
--
to
instruct
the
jury
as
to
what
is
the
meaning
of
an
unreasonably
low
price,
because
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
law
or
custom
that
would
enable
you
to
do
so.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
don't
know
that.
i
say
that
the
--
that
under
the
decided
cases
in
this
court,
we
are
entitled
to
have
that
standard
set
forth
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
and
this
--
and
the
statute
is
--
and
the
standard
is
not
set
forth
in
the
statute.
and
i
say
that
there's
no
way
that
i
can
think
of
to
the
advice
and
instruction
on
unreasonably
low
prices,
unless
you
just
arbitrarily
say
it's
a
matter
of
dollars
and
cents,
how
are
you
going
to
arrive
at
it?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
the
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
instructions
can
be
based
upon
the
--
the
common
law.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
have
to
meet
that
here.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
but
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
the
distinction
is
a
--
is
a
valid
one
that
for
an
unreasonably
low
--
for
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
instruction,
you've
got
ample
authority
in
the
law
already
established
starting
with
the
common
law
as
was
stated
in
cline
against
frink.
you
don't
have
that
for
unreasonably
low
prices
or
indeed
you
don't
have
it
for
sales
below
cost
unless
you
define
cost.
and
that
gets
back
to
the
question
as
to
what
congress
could
have
done,
and
i
say
they
could
have
done
what
the
state
legislatures
did
if
they
really
mean
to
forbid
sales
below
cost
and
it's
not
at
all
clear
from
the
legislative
history
or
from
the
words
unreasonably
low
prices
that
they
did.
in
fact,
as
i've
argued,
unreasonably
low
prices
and
below
cost
are
no
sense
the
same.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well
in
petrillo,
if
the
court
please,
the
--
the
court
held
first
that
you
must
decide
the
--
the
case
on
the
face
--
on
the
basis
of
the
face
of
the
statute.
and
the
court
did
decide
it
on
the
basis
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
and
having
made
that
decision,
recently
conclusion
that
it
was
sufficiently
dealt
with.
the
statute
there
of
course
made
it
a
crime
for
a
--
for
a
union
leader
to
require
and
an
--
an
employer
to
have
more
employees
than
necessary
words
to
that
effect.
and
the
court
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
certainly
think
it
is
your
honor.
i
certainly
think
it
is
because
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
it
was
a
term
that
had
meaning
--
that
had
meaning
in
business
that
--
that
is
ascertainable
for
that
reason.
and
--
but
it
--
but
it
went
right
to
the
face
of
the
statute
and
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
of
that
term
used
in
the
statute
rather
than
upon
any
narrower
construction
of
the
--
of
the
statute
itself.
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
but
i
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
there
is
no
way
to
determine
whether
it
has
an
economic
or
business
justification.
there
are
many,
many
prices
that
are
below
cost
--
that
are
be
low
cost
which
could
have
and
do
have
an
economic
and
business
justification
as
i
have
tried
to
--
and
i
have
tried
to
point
a
few
of
them
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
--
in
my
argument.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
another
--
that's
another
example,
if
your
honor
please.
under
--
the
department
has
prosecuted
--
has
prosecuted
businessmen
for
trying
to
prevent
loss
leader
sales
or
two
for
one
sales
or
one
cent
sales
or
these
other
sales
promotions
which
are
all
below
cost,
have
prosecuted
them
on
the
ground
that
that's
normal
competitive
activity,
that's
perfectly
proper.
those
sales
were
below
cost.
how
is
the
government
going
to
say
that
sale
a
which
is
below
cost
like
the
loss
leader
sales
or
like
the
erroneous
projected
volume
sales,
that
sale
below
cost
is
alright
or
as
some
other
sale
is
all
wrong.
the
fact
that
there
may
be
a
below
defendant's
cost
as
finally
ascertained
after
the
returns
are
all
in
and
the
--
and
the
figures
are
entered
in
the
books
does
not
necessarily
make
it
unreasonable
or
uneconomic
or
on
business
alike
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes
--
yes
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
i
say
we
are
entitled
of
this
notice
and
this
definition
and
this
standard
in
the
statute.
and
that
it's
not
enough
merely
to
have
an
instruction
after
we're
told
by
the
--
in
indictment
to
what
it
means
to
have
an
instruction
that
enables
the
jury
to
pass
upon
it.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
if
your
honor
please,
i
can
only
--
in
doing
so,
i
can
only
use
the
--
the
words
of
the
court
which
i
think
were
applicable
in
that
--
in
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
--
that
case.
and
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
didn't
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
court
helds
that
in
that
--
and
i
--
i
think
properly
so,
in
that
case,
there
were
--
there
were
means
of
common
understanding
and
common
practice,
so
that
the
standard
was
ascertainable.
that's
what
the
court
held
there.
i
say
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
argued
to
the
court,
the
words
below
cost
have
no
general
meaning,
are
not
ascertainable,
a
great
many
sales
can
be
below
cost
that
are
in
no
sense
unreasonable,
and
that
makes
the
standard
indefinite
and
contrary
to
the
fifth
amendment.
and
i
say
in
the
second
place,
there's
nothing
in
this
statute
that
prohibits
sales
below
cost
in
--
in
terms
anyway.
it's
unreasonably
low
prices.
and
that,
likewise,
has
no
meaning
in
the
law,
has
no
meaning
in
common
understanding,
and
i
distinguished
petrillo
on
that
ground.
i
--
i
want
to
say
in
--
in
conclusion,
if
the
court
please,
that
we
have
argued
a
number
of
other
points
in
the
brief,
which
i
shall
not
have
time
to
argue
in
my
oral
argument.
the
first
one
being
that
this
indictment
does
not
limit
the
charge
to
sales
below
cost,
because
it
charges
in
the
general
words
of
the
statute.
we
argue
that
and
explain
our
position,
beginning
on
page
6
of
our
brief.
i
do
not
have
time
to
discuss
it
at
this
time,
and
we'll
rely
upon
our
brief
position
there.
although
i
repeat,
that
we
do
not
depend
entirely
by
any
means
upon
that
construction
argument,
but
upon
the
fundamental
proposition
that
i
have
--
i've
tried
to
argue
to
the
court,
that
the
term
unreasonably
low
prices
is
in
--
too
indefinite
as
well
as
the
term
below
cost
if
the
indictment
--
if
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
to
be
limited
to
below
cost.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
should
remind
the
court
--
i'm
sure
it's
unnecessary
to
do
so
but
i
think
i
should
remind
the
court
at
the
outset,
there
is
not
one
word
in
this
statute
about
cost.
sellers
cost
or
anybody
else's
cost
or
the
word
cost.
the
statute
says
it
shall
be
an
offense
to
sell
at
unreasonably
low
prices
for
the
prescribed
intent.
that's
what
the
statute
says
and
that's
all
the
statute
says.
now,
the
government
has
made
a
halfway
admission,
what
i
think
they
must
and
should
admit
mainly
that
this
statute
has
two
separate
and
distinct
elements
of
which
would
--
which
must
constitute
the
offense.
first
is
selling
below
cost
and
the
second
is
with
the
intent
to
destroy
competition.
now,
each
must
be
proved,
the
government
admits
that,
and
yet,
and
yet,
the
government
contends
in
effect
that
though
they
are
separate
and
distinct,
though
they
are
separate
and
distinct,
selling
below
cost
which
isn't
even
mentioned
in
the
statute.
selling
below
cost
proves
at
least
prima
facie,
both
that
the
sale
at
the
price
was
unreasonable
and
that
the
price
--
and
that
the
intent
was
anticompetitive.
now,
i
think
in
order
to
straighten
out
this
situation
in
the
light
of
the
words
of
the
statute
itself,
i
should
have
the
temerity
to
start
by
reminding
the
court
of
the
cohen
grocery
case,
of
cline
against
frink
dairy
and
of
the
many
cases
which
have
followed.
they
have
held
expressly
and
explicitly
that
the
term
‘unreasonably
high
price'
or
‘unreasonably
low
price'
or
‘unreasonable
price',
or
‘unreasonable
profit'
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
now,
those
decisions
are
expressed
and
there
they
are
and
the
cohen
case
has
been
woven
into
the
firm
fabric
of
the
law
of
this
nation
and
it
has
been
referred
to
by
this
court
over
and
over
again,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
--
a
situation
which
the
government
has
not
referred
to
in
its
brief
or
in
the
record
when
this
very
clause,
the
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
was
before
this
court
in
the
nashville
milk
case.
this
court
referred
to
the
unreasonably
low
price
clause
as
a
vague
provision.
and
in
the
footnote
in
the
decision,
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
lower
court
had
indicated
that
it
would
give
rise
to
constitutional
difficulties
if
the
matter
had
to
be
faced
citing
both
cohen
and
cline
against
frink
dairy
and
those
cases
have
not
been
referred
to
by
the
government
and
nashville
has
not
been
referred
to
the
government.
now,
mr.
friedman
spent
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
rely
upon
the
footnote
except
for
this
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
and
i
will
say
this
mr.
justice,
and
i
will
say
this,
that
in
making
that
observation,
the
court
whether
--
whether
going
into
it
fully
or
not
on
that
occasion,
i
do
not
know,
but
the
court
certainly
was
following
intensely
or
not
the
legislative
history
of
these
things.
why
if
your
honor
please,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
which
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief,
there
is
not
one
word
in
any
statement
by
any
member
of
the
house
or
representatives
or
by
the
senate
with
respect
to
this
unreasonably
low
price
cost.
not
one
word.
it
is
not
construed,
it
is
not
stated
to
mean
below
cost,
there
is
not
--
there
was
no
committee
report
on
it
except
the
conference
report.
there's
no
committee
report
that
mentions
unreasonably
low
--
the
unreasonably
price
clause.
it
isn't
referred
to
or
interpreted
by
a
member
of
congress
nor
is
it
referred
to
or
interpreted
in
a
committee
report
and
there's
not
one
word
in
it
about
selling
below
cost.
now,
the
government
can
get
no
comfort
whatsoever
out
of
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
insofar
as
supplying
meaning
to
this
vague
term
‘unreasonably
low
prices'
is
concerned.
and
i
say
on
the
basis
of
the
decided
authorities
that
that
clause
itself
has
been
decided
by
this
court
in
--
in
cases
i
--
which
i
contended
directly
in
point
to
be
too
vague
to
stand
the
test
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
may
it
please
your
honors,
i
want
to
make
this
additional
observation.
mr.
justice
holmes
did
say
in
the
nash
case
that
law
is
full
of
instances
where
a
man's
faith
and
--
on
estimating
rightly
some
matter
of
degree,
but
mr.
justice
holmes
said
that
in
the
context
of
the
nash
case
in
which
the
court
held
of
course
that
the
--
unreasonably
that
the
--
that
the
sherman
act
was
constitutional
against
the
--
an
attack
of
vagueness.
and
after
mr.
justice
holmes
made
that
observation
in
the
nash
case,
he
concurred
in
the
cohen
grocery
case,
he
concurred
and
cline
against
frink
and
prior
to
that
time,
he
had
ripped
in
the
international
harvester
case
and
certainly
he'd
not
--
did
not
mean
by
that
observation
and
the
court
did
not
mean
by
that
observation
that
a
statute
need
not
to
have
an
ascertainable
standard
of
guilt.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
would
say
if
the
court
had
--
if
the
statute
had
explicitly
--
had
explicitly
outlawed
selling
below
cost
and
have
used
those
terms,
the
court
--
the
statute
should
have
defined
cost
in
order
to
make
it
sufficiently
definite.
it
should
have
defined
cost
as
30
states
have
done
when
they
have
enacted
selling
below
cost
statutes
as
has
been
done
and
in
almost
every
instance
--
in
every
instance
that
i
can
now
think
of,
we
referred
to
them
in
our
brief.
the
state
has
defined
what
cost
means
and
in
answer
your
honors
question,
they
have
some
time
said,
it
shall
mean
cost
of
production.
with
respect
to
a
retailer,
they
have
sometimes
said
it
shall
mean
the
invoice
cost
of
the
merchandise.
we
sell
above
that
your
honor
as
to
a
retailer.
in
other
instances,
they
have
said,
it
shall
be
the
invoice
cost
of
the
merchandise
plus
a
markup
of
2%,
4%,
8%
some
of
them
have
gone
up
as
high
as
12%.
some
of
them
have
said
--
have
separated
retailers
from
manufacturers
and
have
specified
a
certain
definition
of
cost
for
the
one
and
a
somewhat
different
definition
of
cost
for
the
other.
i
say
mr.
justice
harlan
that
it
is
necessary
to
supply
some
meaning
for
the
term
cost
or
else
the
statute
would
fall
as
vague
for
vagueness
just
as
much
as
the
unreasonably
low
price
would.
let
me
illustrate
it,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
said
that
if
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
oh
no
sir,
i
didn't
mean
to
put
them
below
on
the
same
parody
at
all.
i
--
perhaps,
i
misspoke
what
i
meant
to
convey
to
the
court.
what
i
say
is
this,
the
unreasonably
low
price
clause
is
clearly
invalid
and
under
cohen
and
the
other
cases.
it
cannot
be
equated
with
the
term
below
cost.
there
are
two
reasons
why
it
cannot
be.
in
the
first
place,
below
cost
is
not
necessarily
unreasonable.
there
are
many
instances
where
below
cost
is
perfectly
reasonable,
some
have
been
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
white,
others
occurred
to
us
all.
it
is
very
possible
that
a
sale
will
be
below
cost
under
the
circumstances
where
the
costs
are
lowered,
are
increased
rather
during
a
period
of
production.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
prices
are
set
before
the
sale
is
made
of
course.
certain
prices
are
set
if
period
goes
by
during
which
production
takes
place,
the
manufacturer
does
not
sell
a
volume
that
he
thinks
he's
going
to
or
else
other
circumstances
contribute
to
increase
cost
and
it
ends
up
that
he
sells
below
cost
as
it
finally
determined
on
the
books
of
the
company.
i
say
that
since
there
are
so
many
instances
and
other
instances
were
given
by
the
government.
there
are
so
many
instances
whereas
sales
below
cost
could
under
no
circumstances
be
considered
unreasonable
that
you
cannot
equate
the
term
unreasonably
low
prices
with
the
term
below
cost
because
they're
not
--
the
two
are
not
synonymous
in
any
sense.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
oh,
no.
no,
no.
i
didn't
mean
that,
your
honor.
i
meant
if
this
--
if
the
court
--
if
congress
saw
fit
to
outlaw
sales
below
cost
explicitly
which
certainly
they
might
do
in
following
the
state
statutes,
then
i
think
a
mere
provision
that
selling
cannot
be
below
cost
should
be
further
defined
in
some
manner
so
that
a
businessman
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes
sir,
because
i
think
the
term
cost
by
itself
is
not
sufficiently
definite.
the
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
we're
talking
about
the
sellers
cost
now
your
honor
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
would
say
that
there's
no
determination
merely
by
using
the
term
cost
that
he
would
be
in
the
clear
in
selling
above
only
his
invoice
cost
because
it
cost
him
to
do
business.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
he
has
many
other
costs.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
friedman,
in
answer
to
the
question
of
one
of
the
justices,
indicated
that
he
would
have
to
go
above
his
direct
cost
and
above
his
overhead
or
just
--
or
general
cost.
now,
there's
a
very
serious
question
in
a
businessman
be
he
a
retailer
or
a
be
he
a
manufacturer
as
to
whether
his
cost
for
purposes
of
the
selling
below
cost
statute,
if
there
were
one,
would
be
invoice
cost,
as
your
honor
just
stated
so
he'd
be
in
the
clarity
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes
sir,
what
he
paid
for.
if
he
merely
pay
--
if
he
merely
resells
at
a
price
above
what
he
paid
for,
it
is
true
that
he
is
above
his
material
cost.
but
he
is
not
above
his
cost
at
the
time
that
the
merchandise
goes
out
of
his
place
of
business
because
he
has
got
many
other
costs.
in
the
event
of
a
--
of
a
manufacturer,
he
has
his
--
let
us
say
a
dairy
company
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
think
we
do
have
it
here,
your
honor.
that
is
true,
but
i
say
that
even
if
the
court
should
construe
this
in
spite
of
the
legislative
--
complete
absence
of
legislative
history
justifying
it,
even
if
the
court
construe
--
should
construe
this
as
say
--
as
--
meaning
selling
below
cost
contrary
to
our
contention,
i
still
think
there
would
be
a
very
serious
problem
and
that
the
statute
would
not
be
safe
but
that
court,
i
contend,
does
not
have
to
reach
that
point
because
this
statute
does
not
say
cost
in
the
first
place,
and
in
the
second
place,
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
legislative
history,
not
one
word
that
would
justify
the
court
in
construing
the
statute
to
mean
selling
below
cost.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
i
think
i
should
call
this
to
the
attention
of
this
court,
the
only
word
in
the
debates
in
the
congress,
the
only
thing
that
was
said
about
this
unreasonably
low
price
cost,
and
to
me
this
is
very
significant,
where
statements
made
by
two
well-known
congressmen
supporting
the
antitrust
laws,
congressman
patman
and
congressman
celler.
congressman
patman
said
that
it
is
very
indefinite
as
to
what
unreasonably
low
price
means,
so
as
congressman
patman
said,
it's
in
our
brief,
and
it
is
not
further
elaborated.
congressman
celler
in
commenting
upon
section
3
as
a
part
of
the
robinson-patman
act
which
also
covered
the
--
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
risk
discrimination
provisions
of
the
robinson-patman
act
said
that,
“the
congressman's
colorful
language,
the
courts
will
have
to
double
its
own
time
with
it.
and
it
we'll
be
herculean
task
to
make
it
yield
at
any
sense”.
now,
that's
the
legislative
history
of
this
clause
and
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
--
and
i
--
and
i
say
that
the
words
of
congressman
celler
and
of
congressman
patman
were
as
indicated
i
think
quite
prophetic.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
has
to
be
construed
on
the
statute
itself.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
now,
we
are
indicted
under
this
statute
that
contains
this
unconstitutionally
vague
language
and
this
--
and
the
indictment
charges
us
in
the
words
of
the
statute
with
selling
at
unreasonably
low
prices.
that
is
the
indictment
and
that
is
as
mr.
friedman
stated
is
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
charging
clause.
that
is
the
charge
against
us.
now
it
says,
pursuant
to
and
in
effectuation
of
the
offense
charged
in
paragraph
22
confining
the
charge
to
that
in
paragraph
22.
we
are
--
we
have
intentionally
sold
below
cost.
now,
the
lower
court,
and
i'm
not
going
to
labor
at
this
point
in
the
oral
argument
but
the
lower
court
construed
this
statute
--
this
indictment
to
mean
not
only
selling
below
cost
but
also
--
but
otherwise
--
otherwise
selling
at
unreasonably
low
prices
was
not
confined
to
selling
below
cost.
the
lower
courts
so
construed
it.
the
government
lawyer
in
presenting
this
matter
to
the
lower
court
so
argued
the
matter
and
that
is
the
record
before
this
court.
now,
i
say
under
those
circumstances
that
this
court
must
construe
this
as
the
lower
court
did,
as
charging
an
offense
and
must
pass
upon
this
statute,
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
on
the
basis
of
the
words
of
the
statute
itself
must
do
so
on
the
face
of
the
statute
namely
construing
the
words
unreasonably
low
price
to
be
charged
--
construing
indictment
as
the
lower
court
did
to
charge
unreasonably
low
price
sales.
and
so,
i
contend
that
the
court
does
not
have
to
apply
it.
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
a
trial
here
to
determine
what
the
cost
were
or
to
determine
what
the
facts
were
because
as
the
court
will
know,
mr.
wise,
who
was
indicted
here
was
entitled
to
have
the
statute
under
which
he
is
indicted,
entitled
to
have
that
statute
specific,
have
--
and
contain
within
itself
in
the
words
of
the
statute
an
ascertainable
standard
of
guilt
the
statute
must
do
so.
it
does
not
protect
his
rights
under
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
to
be
advised
for
the
first
time
in
this
indictment
as
to
what
the
statute
means.
the
congress
didn't
advise
him,
the
words
of
the
statute
don't
advise
him
and
i
say
he's
entitled
to
be
advised
by
the
statute
itself
or
we
ignore
the
requirements
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
and
he
was
not
informed
in
the
words
of
the
statute
itself
as
to
what
unreasonably
low
prices
mean.
and
i
think,
therefore,
that
the
lower
court
was
amply
justified
and
should
upon
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
counts
of
the
indictments
based
upon
the
statute
for
that
reason.
now,
i
don't
know
that
i
have
been
directly
responsive
to
your
honor's
question.
i've
tried
to
explain
our
position
on
it.
perhaps
i've
gone
too
far.
but
if
your
honor
means
--
if
your
honor
meant
to
inquire
whether
we
--
whether
there's
got
to
be
a
trial
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
because
if
your
honor
please,
i
do
not
think
that
this
statute
bears
any
relation
whatsoever
to
the
term
cost.
let
us
assume
--
let
us
assume
that
there
might
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
may
or
may
not
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
it
may
or
may
not.
the
--
there
could
be
circumstances,
i
would
say,
under
which
he
would
be
amply
justified
in
selling
at
2
cents
instead
of
50
cents
taking
the
extreme
case.
there
certainly
could
be.
they
would
not
necessarily
be
unreasonable
low
--
unreasonably
low.
let
us
assume,
let
us
assume
that
he
was
--
that
he
found
it
necessary
to
do
so
in
order
to
meet
competition
of
the
defendant.
let
us
assume
that
--
our
competitor,
let
us
assume
that
he
found
it
necessary
to
do
so
in
order
to
close
out
a
line.
let
us
assume
that
he
had
founded
--
that
he
found
it
necessary
to
do
so
in
order
to
make
any
sales
at
all.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
no
sir.
i
believe
that
it
goes
to
the
question
of
notice
because
i
think
we're
entitled
to
have
the
statute
specified
that
if
you
sell
below
a
defined
cost
that
you
then
are
violating
the
first
element
of
the
offense
and
i
don't
think
the
statute
does
this.
and
i
urge
--
(voice
overlap)
excuse
me.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
should
necessarily
mean
a
code
of
common
practices.
let
us
assume
that
contrary
to
the
legislative
history,
the
congress
did
want
to
legislate
in
this
field
of
selling
below
cost,
i
think
that
congress
should
establish
some
kind
of
a
standard
as
to
the
meaning
of
cost
which
a
businessman
would
be
enabled
to
follow
intelligently
in
determining
whether
he
was
violating
the
law
or
not.
now,
your
honor
knows
cost
as
well
better
than
i
am
and
your
honor
knows
very
well
that
there
are
so
many
debatable
arguments,
debatable
points
as
to
whether
certain
indirect
cost
should
be
allocated
and
how
they
should
be
allocated.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
your
honor,
it
is
certainly
not
a
well-settled
practice.
let
me
take
an
illustration.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
adjournment,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
was
attempting
to
comment
upon
the
question
that
your
honor
asked
or
a
comment
which
your
honor
made
which
was
in
effect
that
the
congress
doesn't
have
to
write
a
detailed
code
of
accounting
in
the
statute,
and
of
course
i
think
that
is
correct.
we
do
have
--
i
do
--
i
would
like
to
make
two
or
three
comments
on
that.
first
is
that
if
congress
meant
to
outlaw
below
cost
selling,
they
didn't
do
so,
that
is
they
didn't
specifically
refer
to
below
cost
selling
at
any
time
nor
does
the
legislative
history
indicate
that
they
meant
to
do
so.
and
the
second
is
that
if
the
congress
did
mean
to
outlaw
below
cost
selling,
i
think
we're
entitled
to
some
specification
as
to
what
is
meant
by
a
cost.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
in
any
way
a
detailed
specification
of
course,
that
would
be
out
of
place
in
the
statute.
but
assuming
that
it
is
meant
seller's
own
cost
which
is
what
the
government
contends
over
here,
seller's
own
cost
even
if
you
look
just
at
the
seller's
books
and
nothing
else,
doesn't
define
what
the
congress
meant
by
cost
but
for
the
reason
that
got
into
my
answers
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
that
is,
it
is
very,
very
questionable
as
to
what
cost
should
mean
or
would
mean
unless
congress
defines
it
in
a
situation
of
this
sort
as
was
said
in
this
small
case.
there
is
no
general
understanding
as
to
what
a
reasonable
or
unreasonable
price
is
so
that
the
lever
act
will
struck
down
both
in
its
civil
aspects
and
in
its
criminal
aspects
in
the
small
case
for
that
reason.
likewise,
we
say
here,
there
is
no
general
business
understanding
as
to
what
a
sale
of
below
cost
would
mean.
does
it
mean
the
invoice
price
that
the
seller
paid
for
the
goods?
does
it
mean
production
cost
in
the
case
of
a
manufacturer
who
has
labor
cost,
material
cost
and
all
the
rest
in
his
plant?
does
it
mean
in
addition
to
that
that
the
seller
should
include
overhead
cost
of
the
type
that
are
quite
controversial
which
would
include
general
administrative
and
the
like?
now,
the
congress
would
not
have
to
specify
all
that
but
we
say
they
could
give
some
guidelines
that
would
make
it
reasonably
clear
what
the
statute
was
meant
to
cover
as
indeed
the
states
have
done
and
the
states
had
have
sales
below
cost
provisions.
but
basically,
i
want
to
state
and
reiterate
that
our
position
is
that
there's
no
word
--
nothing
about
cost
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
yes
sir,
it
does.
and
if
your
honor
please,
on
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
our
brief,
pages
82
to
83
in
which
we
have
collected
all
of
the
cases
that
have
raised
the
question
of
vagueness
of
the
statute
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
and
we
state
there
that
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
determine
in
every
case
brought
to
this
court,
on
direct
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
after
the
district
court
had
held
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
for
vagueness.
this
court
has
looked
to
the
face
of
the
statute
and
has
determined
the
matter
on
the
face
of
the
statute
otherwise,
otherwise
and
we
list
the
cases
in
there.
the
constitutional
doctrine
of
vagueness,
it
seems
to
us,
could
never
be
decided
except
after
trial
and
that
has
not
been
the
case
because
we
are
entitled
we
say
to
a
specification
in
the
statute
rather
than
in
the
indictment
as
to
what
we
must
do
to
comply
with.
and
following
what
i
said
to
mr.
justice
goldberg
a
moment
ago
when
a
client
consults
counsel
on
a
matter
of
this
kind,
you're
unable
to
tell
him.
well,
you've
got
to
go
below
production
cost.
i
mean
you've
got
to
stay
above
production
cost
but
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
fully
distributed
cost
and
all
of
these
problems
of
allocating
to
particular
products.
it
is
true
as
mr.
friedman
said
that
many
corporations
make
a
great
variety
of
products.
what
sort
of
overhead
must
be
allocated,
some
specification
in
the
statute
as
in
the
statutes
of
the
states,
we
contend,
should
be
specified
if
the
congress
meant
to
outlaw
sales
below
cost.
i
would
also
like
to
comment
for
a
moment
on
the
rule
of
reason
question
which
i
believe
was
brought
up.
i
think
mr.
justice
goldberg
referred
to
it.
+inclined,
the
court,
cline
against
frink
dairy,
the
court
there
distinguished
the
holding
of
the
nash
case
which
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
sherman
act.
from
cohen
and
the
price
cases,
holding
that
the
there
has
been
no
ascertainable
business
standard
for
the
meaning
of
unreasonably
low
prices
or
as
there
has
been
a
standard
for
many
years
both
in
the
common
law
and
of
course
in
the
statute
law
or
--
and
the
case
law
here
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
rule
of
reason
in
antitrust
cases.
that
distinction
was
pointed
out
clearly
in
the
cline
case
and
we
think
it
is
applicable
of
course
to
the
situation
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
unreasonably
low
price
clause
requires
the
alleged
transgressor
to
know
from
the
statute
what
his
price
ought
to
be
in
dollars
and
cents.
he
must
be
able
to
determine
it
whereas
under
the
rule
of
reason
the
question
is
whether
competition
has
been
reduced
and
that
is
an
ascertainable
matter
which
of
course
is
submitted
to
the
jury
in
those
cases
where
the
rule
of
reason
is
invoked.
i
think
the
problem
we
have
here
on
this
cost
question
is
illustrated
by
the
position
the
government
has
taken
here.
the
contrary
positions
they
have
taken
with
respect
to
cost
in
their
brief.
they
say
at
one
point,
the
government
brief
40,
all
appellees
had
to
do
was
to
sell
above
cost
being
the
question
as
to
the
meaning
of
cost,
if
so
they
would
be
safe.
at
another
point,
at
government
brief
page
37,
they
say
that
certain
borderline
cases
may
arise
where
the
selling
price
is
above
the
seller's
cost.
but
it
is
argued
that
the
property
is
too
small
for
the
price
to
be
reasonable
which
would
indicate
that
the
government
itself
is
uncertain
as
to
whether
there
could
be
situations
arise
where
a
sale
above
cost
would
be
claimed
by
the
government
to
be
at
an
unreasonable
price.
i
think
i
should
--
i
would
like
to
comment
in
closing
that
the
nonuse
of
this
statute
for
the
26
years
since
it
has
been
in
effect
is
it
seems
to
me
noteworthy.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
is
the
first
case
contested
in
the
courts
that
has
been
brought
under
this
statute,
the
second
indictment
that
has
been
brought
under
the
statute
in
the
26
years
of
its
existence.
the
first
one
having
been
settled
and
having
been
brought
in
1959,
23
years
after
the
statute
was
adopted.
to
say
the
least,
the
fact
if
its
nonuse
would
indicate
that
it
has
not
been
an
important
part
of
the
antitrust
law.
i
also
want
to
make
this
observation
in
closing
that
the
cases
upon
which
we
rely
starting
with
cohen,
required
seems
to
us,
that
this
statute
should
be
determined
on
its
face
to
be
invalid,
to
violate
the
rule
against
vagueness
and
that
we
and
mr.
wise,
the
individual
defendant
here
as
well
as
the
corporation,
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
having
that
action
taken
so
that
he
will
not
be
put
to
trial
on
an
indict
--
on
a
statute,
the
meaning
of
which
at
this
time
and
at
no
time
had
been
made
clear
to
him
or
to
anyone
else.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it
hasn't
been
an
important
consideration
to
the
department
of
justice
or
in
courts.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
are
you
referring
to
the
third
clause?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
think
that
anyone
has
been
able
to
counsel
very
well
on
it.
i
know
i
haven't
been
because
it
has
been
very
uncertain
as
to
what
it
means.
that
has
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
we've
had
to
do
our
best,
as
your
honor
knows.
i
--
of
course
we
do.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
department
of
justice
hasn't
considered
it
to
be
an
important
part
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
my
position
because
they
haven't
filed
proceedings
under
it.
it
hasn't
been
an
important
part
of
the
antitrust
enforcement
procedures
since
its
adoption
in
1926.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
get
no
notice
that
selling
below
cost
is
in
and
of
itself
a
violation
of
the
first
clause
of
this
clause
three,
the
first
element
of
this
clause
three,
because
there
are
so
many
instances
where
selling
below
cost
is
perfectly
prosecuted.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that
is
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
but
i
am
following
what
i've
just
said,
if
your
honor
please.
let
us
assume
that
a
businessman
is
--
wants
to
do
a
number
of
these
things
which
anyone
would
say
in
and
of
themselves,
a
perfectly
innocent
sales
below
cost
such
as
selling
a
large
stock
of
merchandise
of
below
cost
and
let
us
assume
he
is
doing
so
for
the
purposes
--
for
the
purpose
alleged
in
the
--
in
the
statute
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
the
competitor.
can
he
be
sure
under
the
statute
or
is
he
--
does
he
receive
reasonable
notice
under
the
statute
that
the
sale
below
cost
is
an
unreasonable
--
is
an
unreasonably
low
price
under
those
circumstances.
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
another
case,
that's
another
instance
where
he
could
go
below
cost
for
the
purpose
of
--
for
the
predatory
purpose
and
yet
could
he
say
that
that
is
an
unreasonably
low
price.
he
must
be
enabled
to
say
that
in
order
to
form
a
judgment
as
to
whether
he
has
violated
the
statute.
and
i
say
that
he
cannot
say
that
under
so
many
instances
including
the
one
of
meeting
competition,
which
your
honor
suggests,
that
the
first
clause
which
has
to
be
separated
from
the
intent
clause
in
determining
its
constitutionality
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
because
there
are
so
many
instances
where
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
correct.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
thank
you,
your
honor.
