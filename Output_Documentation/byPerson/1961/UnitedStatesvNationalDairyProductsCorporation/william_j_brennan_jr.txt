justice
william
j.
brennan,

we
say
one
statute
as
i
remember
in
this
screws
case
by
requiring
the
presence
of
requisite
intent.
but
here
even
though
you
have
the
requisite
intent,
you
don't
violate
the
statute
unless
the
price
is
unreasonably
low.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
your
--
i
don't
think
you
have
come
up
--
flashed
with
the
problem
under
our
other
cases
to
whether
or
not
unreasonably
the
low
satisfies
the
standard
for
a
definite
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
can
sell
on
this
statute
at
a
low
price
to
eliminate
a
competitor,
to
get
rid
of
him
and
still
not
violate
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
look
at
you're
brief
on
page
6
near
the
bottom,
you
defined
what's
unreasonably
low.
it
has
no
rational
justification
existing
or
foreseeable
business
condition
other
than
this
seller's
desire
to
destroy
competition.
but
i
would
think
that
under
the
statute,
his
desire
to
destroy
competition
or
eliminate
a
competitor
would
be
wholly
legitimate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
it's
quite
the
opposite
that
they
were
two
distinct
things.
