mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
direct
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
to
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri,
presents
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
provision
in
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
sell
goods
at
unreasonably
low
prices
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition.
the
district
court
in
this
case,
dismissed
the
number
of
counts
under
that
section,
on
the
ground
that
the
statutory
provision
is
so
vague
and
indefinite
as
to
violate
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
the
appellee,
national
dairy
company,
is
a
large
company
engaged
in
the
business
of
purchasing,
processing,
distributing
and
selling
milk
throughout
the
united
states.
the
violations
involved
in
this
indictment
involved
the
area
of
kansas
and
missouri
which
is
served
by
national's
plant
in
kansas
city.
now,
in
this
big
two-state
area,
national
sells
directly
to
customers
in
the
kansas
city
area
itself.
and
in
the
rural
areas
throughout
these
two
states,
it
sells
through
distributors
and
the
indictment
alleged
that
in
such
sales,
national
competes
both
with
other
large
dairies
and
also
with
a
number
of
small
dairies.
the
indictment
was
in
15
counts
and
it
charges
national
dairy
in
parallel
counts.
that
is
a
count
under
the
sherman
act
followed
by
a
count
under
the
robinson-patman
act
relating
to
various
activities
in
numerous
markets.
more
specifically
under
the
robinson-patman
act,
national
and
in
one
count
a
mr.
wise,
its
vice-president
and
director,
are
charged
with
selling
at
unreasonably
low
prices
for
destroying
competition
in
each
of
seven
different
areas.
the
counts
are
basically
identical
under
all
the
robinson-patman
act
charges.
and
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
first
of
the
robinson-patman
act
charges
at
page
9
of
the
record.
this
is
typical
of
the
robinson-patman
act
counts.
the
offense
charged
is
stated
in
paragraphs
22
and
23.
the
first
paragraph,
paragraph
22
begins,
and
in
the
language
of
the
statute
said
that
national
are
engaged
in
the
foresaid
interstate
commerce
sold
milk
to
its
distributor
in
the
paola-osawatomie,
kansas
market
at
unreasonably
low
prices
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
in
that
market
in
violation
of
section
3.
then
the
second
paragraph,
paragraph
23
goes
on
and
particularizes
the
sales
of
unreasonably
low
prices
charged
in
the
statutory
language
in
paragraph
22.
it
alleged
--
pursuant
to
an
effectuation
of
the
offense,
national
utilized
the
advantages
it
possesses
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
operates
in
a
great
many
different
geographical
localities
in
order
to
finance
and
subsidize
a
price
war
against
small
dairies
selling
milk
in
competition
with
it
and
its
distributor
in
the
paola
market.
by
intentionally
selling
milk
to
its
distributor
martin
at
prices
below
national's
cost.
so
what
we
have
in
this
indictment
is
a
charge
that
in
this
particular
market
and
there's
seven
of
them,
national
sold
at
unreasonably
low
prices
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
and
the
particularization
without
the
sales
at
unreasonably
low
prices
here
charged
where
sales
below
cost.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way
if
i
may,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
statute
first
to
see
whether
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
exactly.
but
then
all
that
the
court
has
to
do
to
sustain
the
statute
in
this
case
is
to
say
that
at
least,
as
applied
to
the
sales
charged
in
this
case,
selling
below
cost,
the
statute
clearly
does
provide
a
sufficiently
definite
standard.
but
i
shall,
in
my
argument,
first
argue
generally
as
to
what
the
statutory
standard
is
and
then
go
on
to
show
that
without
having
to
reach
what
maybe
a
more
difficult
problems
in
other
cases,
it
certainly
is
constitutional
to
decide
the
violation
here
charged.
now,
the
statute
is
set
forth
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief
on
re-argument
and
the
statute
contains
three
subsections.
the
first
two
of
them
deal
with
discrimination
in
price
and
the
third
subdivision
which
is
the
one
on
which
we
are
here
concerned
which
is
on
lines
four
to
seven
of
page
3,
makes
it
a
crime
to
sell
or
contract
to
sell
goods
at
unreasonably
low
prices
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
or
eliminating
a
competitor.
so
the
statute
is
composed
of
two
elements
in
addition
to
the
sale
of
the
goods
that
must
be
at
unreasonably
low
prices
and
it
must
be
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
or
eliminating
a
competitor.
now,
while
i
said
that
these
are
separate
elements
and
the
government
must
prove
both
of
them,
we
think
the
elements
are
interrelated.
and
we
think
that
the
‘unreasonably
low
prices';
the
meaning
of
that
phrase
draws
its
meaning
and
has
helped
in
interpretation
by
the
second
clause,
the
specific
purpose.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
the
frame
of
reference
within
which
the
meaning
of
‘unreasonably
low
prices'
is
to
be
determined
is
the
second
section
requiring
for
conviction
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition.
we
think
as
i
shall
now
demonstrate
that
this
clause
from
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute
from
its
legislative
history
and
from
our
entire
antitrust
experience
of
more
than
half
a
century
dealing
with
predatory
pricing,
what
the
statute
is
directed
at.
now,
a
major
purpose
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
and
when
i
say
the
robinson-patman
act
here,
i'm
not
limiting
it
just
to
section
3.
i
also
include
the
civil
price
discrimination
provisions
contained
in
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
was
to
prevent
predatory
pricing.
that
is
pricing
which
is
designed
to
destroy
competition
or
eliminate
a
competitor.
this
statute
was
written
against
the
history
of
many
years
of
our
experience
under
the
antitrust
laws
with
the
devices
by
which
monopolists
and
powerful
firms
have
been
able
to
destroy
their
competition
to
put
competitors
out
of
business,
to
force
weaker
firms
into
cooperation
with
it.
and
this
history
had
shown
that
one
of
the
favorite
devices
which
these
large
firms
and
monopolists
employed
was
cutting
prices
in
warfare
against
a
smaller
firm,
and
in
most
instances
of
course,
what
was
done
was
using
the
profits
in
one
area
when
they
were
not
competing
in
order
to
attack
a
weaker
competitor
and
another
but
not
all
and
this
history
is
shown
in
some
of
the
early
landmark
sherman
act
cases
which
we
have
described
in
our
brief,
for
example,
this
court's
decision
in
the
american
tobacco
case,
the
decision
of
judge
learned
hand
as
the
district
judge
in
corn
products
case
and
both
of
these
leading
cases,
sales
below
costs
were
a
very
effective
method
by
which
these
tremendous
combinations
were
put
together
in
which
competition
was
suppressed
and
by
which
recalcitrant
smaller
firms
were
driven
to
the
war.
and
in
1914,
when
congress
passed
the
original
clayton
act,
it
referred
to
this
practice
and
the
house
committee
report
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
stated
that
it
was
a
common
practice
of
great
and
powerful
combinations
to
lower
prices
of
their
commodities
oftentimes
below
the
cost
of
production
in
certain
communities
and
sections
where
they
had
competition
with
the
intent
to
destroy
and
make
unprofitable
to
the
business
of
their
competitors.
and
similarly,
as
we've
set
out
in
our
brief,
the
legislative
history
of
the
robinson-patman
act
shows
congressional
concern
with
this
predatory
price
cutting.
now,
most
of
the
legislative
history
dealing
with
the
robinson-patman
act
related
again
to
discrimination
and
it
was
in
many
instances,
this
was
what
being
discussed
but
not
all
of
it
there
is
evidence
for
example
that
people
were
terribly
concerned
about
the
practice
of
this
large
firms
cutting
prices.
now,
in
terms
of
the
effect
on
competition,
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
the
large
firm
is
cutting
prices
in
one
area
and
using
its
profits
in
another
area
to
subsidize
them
or
whether
it's
big
enough
that
it
can
afford
to
take
a
loss
in
a
particular
area.
in
both
instances,
the
smaller
firm
that
is
faced
with
this
price
cutting
find
itself
in
the
position
that
it
can't
hold
up
very
long,
it's
either
going
to
go
out
of
business
or
it
may
find
that
it
just
has
to
give
in.
it's
going
to
stop
its
price
warfare.
much
of
this
price
warfare
in
these
areas
is
designed
not
to
put
someone
out
of
business
but
to
get
them
to
bring
their
prices
up
to
the
level
of
the
large
firm
thinks
appropriate.
and
all
these
experience
in
history
to
us
illuminates
what
the
congress
was
driving
at
in
this
third
clause
of
section
3.
we
think
that
what
we
have
in
section
3
is
this,
we
have
the
first
two
clauses
which
deal
with
price
discriminations
and
those
are
made
crimes.
we
have
the
third
clause
which
then
goes
on
to
make
it
a
crime
to
sell
at
unreasonably
low
prices
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition.
we
think
what
congress
intended
to
reach
by
that
clause
was
the
same
type
of
predatory
practices
that
history
have
shown,
were
frequent
methods
by
which
large
economic
firms
throw
their
competitors
to
the
wall
and
which
however
did
not
come
within
the
precise
boundaries
of
the
discrimination.
i'd
like
to
illustrate
that.
first
of
all,
many
large
firms
may
sell
multiple
products.
so
they
have
for
example
a
firm
selling
milk
at
unreasonably
low
prices
in
a
particular
area.
it
would
necessarily
have
to
make
that
up
on
selling
milk
in
other
areas
at
higher
prices.
it
could
make
it
up
by
selling
butter
or
cheese
or
some
other
dairy
products.
in
that
situation,
there
would
not
be
discrimination
than
the
meaning
of
section
3.
similarly,
products
such
as
milk,
there
are
frequently
local
variations
in
price.
the
nature
of
the
milk
industry
as
such
that
milk
is
sold
at
different
prices
so
that
the
mere
proof
that
a
company
sold
milk
at
one
price
in
the
kansas
city,
missouri
market
and
at
another
price
in
the
chicago
market
might
not
itself
be
sufficient
to
establish
discrimination
and
therefore
we
think
what
congress
did
was
to
go
on
and
prohibit
sales
at
unreasonably
low
prices
the
same
kind
of
predatory
sales
which
did
not
however
have
the
particular
element
of
discrimination
which
is
condemned
by
section
2.
and
we
think
in
the
light
of
this
experience
and
this
purpose
that
the
phrase
to
sell
unreasonably
low
prices
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
means
that
a
price
is
unreasonably
low
when
it
lacks
any
rational
foundation
in
the
seller's
normal
business
methods
which
would
justify
it
being
said
other
than
a
purpose
to
destroy
competition.
let
me
illustrate
if
i
may.
ordinarily,
a
seller
operates
at
a
profit.
now,
if
a
seller
is
selling
a
product
at
a
price
which
could
not
be
justified
by
the
business
considerations,
the
exigencies
of
the
business
which
a
reasonable
man
would
rely
on
in
setting
his
prices.
and
if
you
add
to
that,
the
further
specific
intent,
the
predatory
purpose
the
intention
to
destroy
competition,
we
think
that
is
selling
at
unreasonably
low
price
for
this
purpose.
and
we
think
certainly,
at
least
where
the
product
is
priced
below
cost
with
the
predatory
purpose.
this
is
plainly
an
unreasonably
low
price.
there
may
be
situations
of
course
in
which
selling
below
price,
below
cost
has
a
legitimate
business
purpose
for
example
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
for
example
let
me
give
the
case
of
a
businessman
who
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
surplus
merchandise
or
merchandise
which
is
spoiled
now
which
is
obsolete,
he
may
find
that
the
appropriate
business
method,
the
normal
practice
of
getting
rid
of
this
merchandise
is
to
sell
it
below
cost
to
clear
it
out.
but
in
that
situation,
in
that
situation,
he
would
not
have
the
intent
to
destroy
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
not
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
the
normal
process
of
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
trying
to
take
away
business
from
a
competitor.
every
seller
is
trying
to
take
business
away
from
the
competitor
but
this
statute
goes
beyond
that
fact.
this
statute
requires
a
purpose
to
destroy
competition
or
to
eliminate
a
competitor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
even
though
you're
after
him
provided
--
provided
mr.
justice,
you're
not
doing
this
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
him
or
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
you
were
doing
it
for
the
purpose
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
it's
below
cost.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
well,
you're
meeting
his
price
but
it
seems
to
me
--
meaning
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
meeting
his
price
--
meeting
his
price
is
--
happens
to
be
the
case
but
it
seems
to
me
the
basic
question
is
whether
it
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
yes
and
i'm
suggesting
that
if
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
mr.
justice,
sir.
if
i'm
not
--
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
if
it's
done
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
a
competitor's
price
then
we'd
say
that
would
not
be
an
unreasonably
low
price.
in
other
words,
it
would
not
prove
the
first
element
because
in
that
situation
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
--
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
doesn't
so
show
but
the
allegation
of
the
sherman
act
counts
as
one
of
their
purposes
was
to
eliminate
a
differential
between
the
price
charged
by
the
small
dairies
to
selling
milk
and
glass
containers
in
the
price
these
people
charge
for
selling
milk
in
paper
cartons
so
this
is
apparently
what
is
involved
in
the
case.
the
record
does
not
show
that
as
i
say
because
it
comes
up
on
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
will
address
myself
to
that
right
now.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
we
--
as
i
say,
we
think
that
the
statutes,
the
words
‘unreasonably
low'
have
to
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
the
basic
purpose
and
we
think
that
when
it's
interpreted
in
light
of
the
purpose
that
a
price
is
unreasonably
low
when
its
level
cannot
be
justified
except
in
terms
of
attempting
to
destroy
competition
or
eliminate
a
competitor.
we
then
think
it
does
come
within
the
cases
which
this
court
has
previously
upheld
statutes
of
this
type
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'd
say
you'd
just
deal
with
it
as
applied
and
let
me
explain
why.
the
basic
theory
of
the
rule
of
definiteness
is
to
enable
a
person
to
know
when
he
acts
whether
he
is
violating
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
notice,
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
the
question
that
seems
to
us
in
terms
of
this
case
is
whether
this
appellee
or
these
appellees
were
fairly
unnoticed
when
they
did
the
things
charged
in
the
indictment
that
is
selling
below
cost
for
a
predatory
purpose
that
they
were
violating
this
statutory
prohibition
against
selling
unreasonably
low
prices
for
that
purpose.
and
we
think
that
whatever
may
be
the
difficulties
in
other
cases,
certainly,
a
businessman
who
sells
below
cost
for
this
stated
purpose
of
destroying
competition
can
have
no
doubt
that
he
is
violating
the
unreasonably
low
prices.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
--
in
this
case,
the
indictment
allegedly
sold
intentionally
below
cost.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
we
--
we
believe
we
can
prove
that
they
sold
below
cost
as
shown
on
their
books.
now,
we
would
say
ordinarily
that's
not
i
have
to
say
not
so
alleged
in
the
indictment
but
we
think
it
falls
intentionally.
but
we
think
going
a
little
beyond
that
that
costs
means
basically
the
costs
as
shown
on
their
books.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
can
tell
i
think
mr.
justice
because
the
indictment
here
alleges
that
the
sales
we're
below
cost.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
its
terms
intentionally
selling
below
cost
not
inadvertently
that
in
that
situation
as
--
i
suggest
that
they
knew
they
were
selling
below
cost
and
therefore,
if
it
can
be
shown
that
they
were
selling
below
cost
are
shown
in
their
books
or
if
it
can
be
shown
that
they
gave
some
indication
they
knew
they
were
selling
below
cost
then
we
think
clearly
that
meets
the
standard.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
point
--
the
exact
point
i
have
in
mind.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
be
wholly
legitimate
he
was
not
selling
it
at
an
unreasonably
low
price.
in
other
words,
we
think
the
two
are
interrelated
we
think.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they're
two
separate
things
but
i
think
the
one
borrows
meaning
from
the
other.
in
other
words,
what
is
unreasonably
low
has
to
be
related
to
the
basic
purpose
for
which
the
sales
are
made
that
is
whether
they
are
a
legitimate
business
activity,
a
pricing
practices
which
a
reasonable
seller
would
normally
follow
absent
an
intention
to
destroy
competition
or
whether
they
are
in
fact
intended
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
the
competition.
and
may
i
suggest
that
there
are
going
to
be
many
cases
where
this
is
like
so
many
other
areas
of
the
law
that
it's
a
matter
that
will
have
to
be
resolved
for
the
jury.
the
jury
will
get
all
of
this
evidence
and
the
jury
will
have
to
make
the
value
judgment
as
question
of
decree
really,
whether
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
almost
certainly.
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
more
precise
than
that
and
i
think
it's
as
precise
as
such
phrases
as
requiring
a
broadcaster
to
hire
more
than
the
number
of
employees
he
needed
prohibition
against
adopting
more
than
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation.
just
unreasonable
charges,
unreasonable
waste
of
natural
gas,
a
host
of
standards
which
this
court
has
adopted
and
i
think
mr.
justice
holmes'
statement
in
the
nash
case
many
years
ago
in
upholding
the
sherman
act
is
very
pertinent
here
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
the
law
is
full
of
instances
where
a
man's
fate
depends
upon
its
estimating
rightly
that
is
as
the
jury
subsequently
estimates
at
some
manner
of
degree.
and
also,
in
the
regan
case
in
which
this
court
upheld
a
criminal
indictment
involving
charges
of
deducting
more
than
a
reasonable
allowance
for
compensation
pointed
out
that
the
mere
fact
that
appeal
statute
is
so
framed
as
to
require
a
jury
upon
occasion
to
determine
a
question
of
reasonableness
is
not
sufficient
to
make
it
too
vague
to
afford
a
practical
guide
to
permissible
conduct.
now,
i
just
like
to
say
one
thing
with
respect
to
the
cases
upon
which
our
opponents
rely
and
which
this
court
has
struck
down
statutes
as
unduly
vague.
the
leading
case
of
course
is
the
cohen
case
which
said
that
a
prohibition
on
willfully
charging
unjust
or
unreasonable
prices
for
necessaries
was
bad.
we
think
the
basic
distinction
between
that
case
and
the
other
cases
that
they
rely
on
--
and
this
case
is
that
in
those
cases,
the
standards
of
unreasonable
prices
were
just
up
in
the
air.
it
was
not
tied
to
any
specific
thing
by
which
you
could
identify
it.
there's
no
basic
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
in
this
case,
we
think,
that
the
statute
does
get
meaning
after
two
facts.
first,
it
appears
not
just
unreasonable
prices
but
unreasonably
low,
and
unreasonably
low,
we
think
in
the
light
of
our
antitrust
history
discloses
a
basic
concept
here,
predatory
prices.
and
in
addition
to
that
here,
in
contrast
to
the
cone
case
where
the
only
intent
was
the
requirement
of
willfulness.
in
this
case,
we
have
the
specific
intent.
and
in
conclusion,
i
just
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
really
how
the
congress
could
draw
a
more
definite
standard.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice,
it
could
say
below
cost
but
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
below
cost
in
this
case
but
the
statute
is
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
well,
we
have
two
things
mr.
justice.
we
have
a
broader
standard
which
we
think
below
cost
is
clearly
an
unreasonably
low
price
but
we
suggest
that
may
be
other
areas
where
the
sales
even
not
below
cost
may
violate
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i'm
sorry.
i
misspoke
myself.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
would
violate
the
statute
if
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
a
competitor.
that
is
nearly
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
this
competition.
again,
it's
basically
a
question
of
the
intent
with
which
these
price
cuts
were
met.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
this
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
would
be
not
violating
the
statute
because
there,
it
would
be
--
this
would
be
arguable
certainly,
but
certainly
a
legitimate
business
justification.
this
is
one
way
of
increasing
your
volume.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
there
was
--
i
think
in
that
situation,
there
wouldn't
have
been
the
requisite
intent
to
destroy
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
not
to
help.
he
was
doing
this
to
get
more
business
but
not
to
put
them
out
of
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
say
that
i
think
cost
means
one
of
two
things
as
used
in
the
indictment.
either
the
cost
as
shown
by
their
books
or
if
they
did
not
have
books
which
showed
cost
whatever
their
normal
sound
accounting
practice
has
shown.
in
other
words,
if
a
seller
did
not
show
cost
on
his
books
but
under
his
accounting
system,
the
price
is
reflected.
that
would
be
the
situation
because,
again,
it's
the
seller's
cost
and
again,
it's
the
question
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
it
includes
both
direct
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
of
course,
i
might
point
out
the
--
strangely
enough
that
this
is
a
peculiar
situation
that
it's
to
the
defendant's
interest
to
show
that
their
cost
are
as
low
as
possible
and
presumably
to
the
government's
interest
in
proving
below
cost
to
show
that
their
cost
are
as
high
as
possible.
but
i
would
say
that
if
their
books,
their
regular
books
show
that
their
sales
were
below
cost,
that
would
meet
the
standard
if
conversely
they
show
that
their
sales
were
above
the
cost
on
their
books
under
this
indictment,
we
haven't
proven
our
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
but
this
statute
with
the
intent
and
with
the
whole
history
gives
this
businessman
fair
warning
as
to
what
conduct
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
and
particularly,
if
i
may
just
add,
when
he
sells
below
cost.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
necessarily.
that
would
depend
on
the
basis
upon
which
you
set
your
price.
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
there
were
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you're
going
to
destroy
your
competitor
but
there's
the
further
qualification
that
this
price
could
not
be
justified
on
any
of
the
other
normal
business
exigencies.
in
other
words,
let
me
put
it
--
i
will
see
if
i
can
put
it
--
perhaps
put
it
this
way,
mr.
justice.
if
i
set
a
price
which
a
normal
reasonable
businessman
would
feel
was
a
fair
price
under
all
the
circumstances
and
if
in
setting
that
price,
i
still
have
the
intention
to
destroy
competition,
that
does
not
violate
the
statute
because
the
second
--
the
first
element,
the
element
of
unreasonably
low
that
there'll
be
no
other
rational
justification
for
the
price
other
than
the
intent
to
destroy
competition
is
lacking.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
think
--
i
suggest
to
things
mr.
justice.
first,
that
we
think
this
requires
something
more
than
merely
intending
the
normal
consequence
of
an
intent,
we
think
there
has
to
be
something
more
--
there
has
to
be
some
showing
of
purpose.
but
certainly,
of
course,
this
is
a
question
for
the
jury
in
this
kind
of
case.
in
other
words,
the
jury
will
have
to
draw
the
inference
from
all
of
the
evidence
before
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
mere
--
not
the
mere
fact
that's
it's
being
discriminatory
alone.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
was
--
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
covered
--
that
is
covered
by
--
that
is
a
provision
of
section
3.
there
are
other
provisions
which
specifically
deal
with
price
discrimination.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
one
of
them
does,
yes.
now
i
would
--
i
would
say
again
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice.
i
would
think
the
discrimination
that
you
suggest
would
be
significant
in
determining
what
the
basic
purpose
of
the
price
was.
in
other
words,
if
a
seller
--
it
was
found
that
a
seller
discriminated
between
two
customers
in
the
same
city.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
not
think
that's
enough.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
did
you
have
question?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
because
it
would
be
a
legitimate
business
practice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
of
course
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
essence
of
the
competitive
system
is
that
if
you're
more
efficient
than
i
am,
the
chances
are,
you're
going
to
profit
and
i'm
going
to
fail
and
perhaps
this
may
have
the
consequence
of
driving
me
out.
but
this
it
seems
to
me
is
something
quite
different.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
motive
maybe
a
matter
of
degree
first
of
all,
and
secondly,
i
think
one
difference
is
the
--
i
mean
this
is
just
what
they
do
in
terms
of
their
pricing.
how
well
they
go?
what
the
circumstances
are?
what
other
explanations
there
may
be
for
this?
thank
you.
