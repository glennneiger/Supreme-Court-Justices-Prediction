justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
going
to
ask
you.
how
many
prosecutions
did
the
government
brought
under
this
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
i
asked
was
because
when
i
wrote
an
opinion
some
years
ago
in
nashville,
i
couldn't
find
that
i
ever
used
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
there
been
any
convictions
under
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
should
we
judge
a
statute
on
its
face
or
is
it
supplied?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
all
i
was
taking
with
you
is
this.
supposing
this
indictment
as
it
might
have
simply
charge
the
offense
and
the
terms
of
the
statute.
and
then
the
--
the
defendants
should
answer
a
bill
of
particulars
and
what
is
now
in
the
indictment
has
been
supplied
by
way
of
bill
of
particulars.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
how
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
then,
would
you
judge
the
statute
if
you
have
the
case
up
here
in
that
posture,
would
you
judge
it
in
light
of
the
bill
of
particulars
or
would
you
judge
it
extra
bill
of
particulars?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
you
say
that
the
solicitor
general's
argument
that
if
this
statute
is
struck
down
for
vagueness
it's
in
effect
saying
that
congress
cannot
legislate
in
this
field?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
of
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
the
thrust
of
your
argument
that
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
the
statute
is
good
or
bad
except
in
the
context
of
this
indictment,
is
that
your
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
charged
from
the
beginning.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
should
we
deal
with
the
statute?
odd
states
do
not
apply,
you
can
produce
cases
on
both
sides
of
the
question
that's
one
of
the
most
mixed
up
fields
of
law
that
i
know.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
question
of
notice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
trouble
is
that
when
you
put
in
costs,
that's
got
--
that's
about
as
vague
as
unreasonable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
your
position?
is
it
out
of
pocket
cost?
what
are
you
going
trying
to
prove
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
my
trouble
is
that
if
you
take
the
premise
that
you
are
to
treat
the
question
of
vagueness
and
turns
that
the
statute
is
applied,
how
can
we
tell
from
this
record
until
there
has
been
a
trial
to
know
how
it's
going
to
be
applied.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
cost
still
got
that
element
of
vagueness
in
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
that's
arguing
is
that
the
second
element
of
intention
and
you
call
it
intention
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition,
infuses
definiteness
either
into
unreasonably
low
prices
or
which
seems
to
me
to
be
equally
indefinite
cost
--
internal
cost.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
that's
i
gather
your
problem
now
at
this
stage
at
least.
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
ask
you
this.
when
you
say
below
cost,
you
say
we
should
take
the
statute
as
applied.
and
by
applied,
you
say,
you
should
read
the
statute
in
relation
to
the
indictment
which
refers
to
cost.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
do
you
take
the
next
step
and
say,
the
cost
in
the
indictment
means
cost
as
reflected
on
the
books?
how
do
you
define
cost?
how
should
we
read
cost
in
the
indictment
assuming
that
we
should
read
the
indictment
into
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
concept
embrace
direct
cost
only?
does
it
include
undistributed
cost?
justice
john
m.
harlan
everything.
justice
john
m.
harlan
really,
what's
your
argument
all
comes
down
to
if
i
get
it
is
that
in
the
context
of
this
practice
in
the
antitrust
atmosphere
a
reasonable
businessman
would
know
what
he's
up
against
in
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
really
what
it
comes
down
to.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
argument
would
go
whether
it's
--
i
would
suppose
without
regard
to
whether
you
read
cost
into
the
statute
or
just
take
the
statute
on
its
face.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
way
that
businessman
knows
that
price
cutting
with
predatory
purposes
is
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
always
has
been
and
therefore
he
takes
a
calculated
risk
that
what
he
does
is
going
to
be
--
he's
going
to
be
able
to
sell
it
to
the
jury
but
as
far
as
notice
is
concerned,
that's
enough.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
really
the
essence
of
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
after
all
you
can't
rely
too
heavily
on
that
footnote.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
simply
presents
us
to
the
problem
that
we
have
flushed
there.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
part
of
this
indictment
had
charged
that
you
sell
below
cost,
and
by
cost,
meaning
below
the
price
that
you
paid
for
the
raw
milk.
how
would
you
say
then
as
to
vagueness?
justice
john
m.
harlan
prophetic.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
would
you
take
two
or
three
minutes?
i
know
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
anymore.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
should
we
do
if
it's
one
thing
to
construe
this
statute
on
its
face
that
presents
one
set
of
problem?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
government
shies
away
from
it
in
their
argument.
it's
another
thing
to
construe
the
statute
as
applied
and
my
ultimate
question,
if
that
is
the
approach
we
should
take,
how
in
the
world
can
we
construe
this
problem
of
vagueness
at
all
on
this
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
this.
why
is
congress
into
--
you
were
a
lawyer
and
he
says,
here
is
the
statute
and
am
i
violating
the
law
if
i
do
this?
and
then
he
says,
i
want
to
put
this
fellow
out
of
business
and
i'm
going
to
sell
at
2
cents
where
my
cost
--
direct
cost
is
50
cents.
is
that
illegal?
and
any
lawyer
would
tell
him
of
course
it
was
under
the
statute.
now,
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
if
the
statute
is
a
question
of
notice
we're
dealing
with.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
the
proof
in
the
trial
shows
that
extreme
situation.
why
hasn't
he
had
sufficient
on
this
that
what
he's
doing
is
illegal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
includes
it
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
hypothetical
case
would
certainly
fall
within
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
isn't
that
the
risk?
that
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
notice,
that's
the
risk
that
mr.
justice
holmes
is
talking
about
when
he
said
you're
going
to
take
--
calculate
the
risk
of
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
this
case
comes
up
in
the
merits
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
lose
it,
it
comes
up
in
the
merits.
you
said,
this
still
be
in
front
of
the
(inaudible)
congress
meant.

john
m.
harlan
