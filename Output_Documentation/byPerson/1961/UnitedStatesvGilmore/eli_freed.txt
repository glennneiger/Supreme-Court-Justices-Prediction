mr.
eli
freed
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
this
court.
i
would
like
to
give
some
attention
to
the
question
passed
by
mr.
justice
harlan
of
counsel
of
which
the
counsel
didn't
have
the
time
to
answer.
the
question
was
that,
as
i
understood
it,
that
if
an
--
if
a
husband
and
wife
before
any
divorce
action,
should
become
engaged
in
litigation
to
dissolve
or
partition
the
community
property
whether
the
legal
expenses
of
the
husband
in
such
a
case
would
be
deductible
expenses.
the
case
of
kornhauser
against
united
states
discussed
by
counsel,
touches
directly
on
this
subject,
i
believe.
in
kornhauser
which
is
one
of
the
leading
cases,
there
was
a
suit
by
two
lawyers
who
had
formerly
been
law
partners.
the
plaintiff
claimed
that
if
the
part
--
law
partner
had
received
some
fees
during
the
partnership,
the
fees
consisted
of
shares
of
stock
and
that
the
defendant
or
partner
have
failed
to
account
for
those
fees.
the
legal
expense
of
defending
that
action
was
deducted.
the
deduction
was
disallowed
and
the
question
that
was
at
issue
on
that
subject
was
whether
those
expenses
were
personal.
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
they
were
capital
in
nature,
but
as
i
read
the
case,
i
understood
that
the
principal
contention
was
that
they
should
be
disallowed
primarily
because
they
were
personal
because
the
partnership
no
longer
existed
and
the
court
--
this
court
held
that
since
these
legal
expenses
that
were
incurred
were
approximately
related
to
a
partnership
and
a
dissolution
of
the
partnership,
they
were
deductible
because
expenses
should
be
just
as
deductible
if
they
incurred
in
the
pursuit
of
income
as
to
defend
income
and
retain
such
(inaudible).
now,
in
the
case
of
a
husband
and
wife
at
california,
in
addition
to
the
marital
obligations
that
they
have
to
each
other,
they
have
a
distinct
and
well-recognized
property
relationship.
the
community
property
relationship
of
the
husband
and
wife,
they
in
some
sense
--
in
a
sense
to
be
regarded
this
as
substitute
for
what
rights
that
the
wife
has
against
the
husband
and
non-community
property
states.
those
are
the
property
rights
that
are
well-established.
they've
been
even
criticized
as
we
put
it
out
in
our
brief
that
is
the
relationship
has
been
criticized
as
too
much
of
a
business
relationship,
but
in
this
day
and
age,
i
think
we
can
readily
understand
that
the
addition
to
the
marital
obligations
of
husbands
and
wives
has
to
each
other
that
they
--
they
regard
that
they
--
the
husbands
and
wives
in
california
regard
each
other
as
partners
insofar
as
the
earnings,
that
is
the
income,
the
gains
and
the
losses
of
the
community
here
concerned.
it's
my
understanding
that
counsel
contends
that
--
that
generally
expenses
that
are
incurred
to
conserve
property
held
for
the
production
of
income
are
deductible,
but
that's
not
so
in
the
case
of
a
husband
and
wife.
in
a
situation
where
they
become
engaged
in
the
dispute
which
is
initiated
by
a
divorce
action,
it's
our
view
that's
unrealistic
and
unfair.
that
in
california,
particularly,
and
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
the
husband
and
wife
have
this
so-called
partnership
relationship
as
well
as
this
marriage
relationship
and
there
can
be
more
than
one
issue
between
them
in
an
action
which
is
termed
a
divorce
action.
in
this
case
--
there
was
a
divorce
action,
but
there
was
also
a
distinct
controversy
recognized
by
the
court
below
as
being
the
most
important
controversy
over
the
question
of
whether
there
was
community
property
and
that
there
is
was
--
a
community
property
and
the
community
property
had
to
be
dissolved
which
is
one
of
the
incidence
of
that
type
of
proceeding,
namely,
if
there
is
community
property
in
that
same
action,
there
was
this
partition
or
dissolution
of
the
community
that
has
been
referred
to.
now,
if
there
had
been
--
if
the
wife
in
the
gilmore
case
had
succeeded
in
proving
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
trial
court
that
there
was
community
property,
and
she
had
a
reason
to
expect
that
she
would
get
a
portion
of
it
whether
she
win
or
lost
the
divorce
action
and
mr.
gilmore,
the
taxpayer
could
expect
whether
he
won
or
loss
the
divorce
that
his
wife
could
reasonably
expect
a
substantial
portion
of
the
community
property.
mr.
eli
freed
i
would
like
to
explain
that.
mr.
eli
freed
there
are
i
believe
five
grounds
for
divorce
in
california.
two
of
the
grounds
are
involved
in
this
case,
adultery
and
extreme
cruelty,
the
other
grounds
i
may
mention
as
i
remember,
desertion,
habitual
temperance
and
insanity.
in
the
case
of
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery,
when
the
court
finds
that
there
is
community
property,
the
court
is
required
by
law
to
award
upon
the
dissolution
of
the
community
property
more
than
50%
to
the
innocent
spouse.
mr.
eli
freed
yes,
just
community.
there
is
no
obligation
at
all
in
--
mr.
eli
freed
50%
or
more
than
50%.
mr.
eli
freed
entirely
discretionary,
maybe
51%
and
conceivably
it
could
be
all.
mr.
eli
freed
if
the
court
had
found
that
there
was
community
property.
mr.
eli
freed
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
deny
mrs.
gilmore
any
of
the
community
property
because
she
was
found
to
be
the
guilty
party.
mr.
eli
freed
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
eli
freed
yes,
the
court
could
have
granted
her
as
much
as
49%.
mr.
eli
freed
up
to
50%.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
now
the
crux
of
this
tax
case
is
found
in
the
finding
of
the
court
of
claims
that
80%
or
more,
and
i
believe
i
should
emphasize
those
words
or
more.
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
the
court
of
claims
that
it
should
be
at
least
80%,
that
80%
or
more
of
the
legal
expenses
involved
were
incurred
for
services
to
defeat
the
efforts
of
the
wife
to
establish
that
there
was
community
property
and
to
that
--
in
her
claim
that
she
was
entitled
to
at
least
50%
of
it.
the
consequences
to
mr.
gilmore
in
case
she
had
succeeded
or
apparent
in
the
findings,
the
other
findings,
he
was
exposed
to
the
risk
in
case
she
secured
any
of
the
community
property
upon
dissolution
of
the
community
which
consists
of
stock
and
these
automobile
corporations,
he
was
exposed
to
the
risk
of
having
the
franchises
of
the
automobile
dealerships
cancelled.
there
are
other
reasons
such
as
the
fact
that
the
dealerships
were
required
to
maintain
minimum
capital
standards
and
the
record
shows
that
that
could
not
have
been
done
if
she
had
secured
any
substantial
part
of
the
community
property.
that
finding
of
the
court
of
claims
as
i
understand
it,
(inaudible)
is
conclusive
here.
i
also
understand
that
from
my
reading
of
the
case
of
being
in
the
crest
of
this
court
that
mr.
--
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
chief
justice
stone
was
held
that
--
that
the
question
of
whether
the
expenses
involved
in
such
dispute
as
this
are
proximately
re-enlightened
to
the
question
of
whether
these
services
and
expenses
were
--
that
is
the
expenses
were
incurred
for
the
conservation
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income,
but
that
question
of
proximity
is
for
the
trier
of
fact
ordinarily.
and
i
submit
that
the
court
below
found
as
an
ultimate
fact
that
the
expenses
in
the
case
of
barr
are
proximately
or
were
proximately
related
to
the
conservation
of
mr.
gilmore's
stock,
property
which
held
for
the
production
of
income,
a
property
which
was
i
can
say
with
the
nominal
exception
was
his
entire
source
of
income
and
it
was
the
policy
of
congress
as
i
understand
it
and
the
intent
of
congress
that
in
adding
section
or
subdivision
2
to
section
23
(a)
of
the
1939
code
to
remove
the
inequity
that
had
existed
between
situations
where
expenses
if
incurred
in
business
approximately
related
to
the
production
of
income
were
deductible
but
expenses
that
were
of
an
on
business
nature
although
likewise
proximately
incurred
or
incurred
proxi
--
approximately
in
relation
to
the
conservation
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income
were
not
deductible
and
i
don't
see
any
sound
reasoning
for
discriminating
the
dispute
between
the
husband
and
wife
where
if
the
--
a
similar
--
somewhat
similar
dispute
that
is
related
to
--
as
much
related
to
property
held
for
the
production
of
income
as
in
this
case
why
there
should
be
discrimination
could
be
disallowed
in
the
case
of
a
husband
and
wife
is
because
they're
married.
now
in
california
but
it's
not
unusual
for
husbands
and
wives
to
actually
go
into
a
partnership
together.
they
have
that
right
under
our
law
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
they
can
reach
any
agreement
they
see
fit
in
regard
to
property.
i
think
that
this
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
are
such
partnerships.
like
i
am
a
member
of
such
a
partnership,
my
wife
is
a
lawyer
and
in
such
a
case
if
there
was
a
divorce
action
and
there
should
also
be
dissolution
of
a
community
partnership.
as
i
understand
it,
the
rule
intended
for
by
counsel
would
be
extended
to
such
a
case
and
expenses
incurred
to
preserve
property
held
production
of
income
or
expenses
incurred
in
the
dissolution
of
such
a
marital
partnership
should
not
be
allowed
because
they
got
married
and
that
was
the
origin
that
continues
to
run
through
all
of
their
activities
thereafter
it
would
seem.
mr.
eli
freed
that
happens
to
be
my
view
although
i
don't
think
that
that
view
must
necessarily
be
adopted
in
our
case.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
i
would
be
very
sympathetic
to
that
view
that
there
should
be
no
discrimination
against
a
husband
who
knowingly
and
deliberately
incurs
expenses
and
it
pains
him
as
much
as
anyone
else
to
go
out
of
pocket
to
defend
and
conserve
his
rights
in
property
which
he
holds
for
the
production
of
income.
i
see
no
reason
for
distinguishing
between
a
husband
and
wife
and
between
people,
two
persons
who
are
not
husband
and
wife.
mr.
eli
freed
i
don't
think
they
can
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
eli
freed
a
divorce
action
cannot
be
tried
before
a
jury
--
mr.
eli
freed
for
a,
say
an
account
--
dissolution
in
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
eli
freed
yes,
a
refund
case.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
mr.
eli
freed
yes
sir,
i
certainly
believe
that
if
i
were
in
a
jury
case,
i
think
the
jury
should
have
the
right
to
determine
as
a
fact
whether
the
expenses
were
incurred.
mr.
eli
freed
not
for
the
divorce
itself
but
whether
they
were
incurred
for
services
that
were
rendered
directly
in
connection
with
the
property
controversy.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
mr.
eli
freed
not
always,
your
honor.
in
california,
the
--
there
--
it's
quite
possible
for
them
to
try
the
divorce
action
and
not
dissolve
or
dispose
of
their
property
relationship.
mr.
eli
freed
no.
mr.
eli
freed
most
of
the
time
your
honor.
mr.
eli
freed
no.
mr.
eli
freed
i
should
think
so.
it
would
affect
the
deduction
of
expenses
which
people
will
incur
in
these
kinds
of
cases
that
they
--
mr.
eli
freed
but
you
still
have
to
determine.
mr.
eli
freed
i've
given
a
lot
of
thought
to
that
problem
and
i
concluded
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
trier
of
fact
to
determine
and
it
could
determine
whether
the
primary
purpose,
and
i
use
the
words
primary
purpose
knowingly
because
it's
often
used
in
tax
cases,
primary
business
purposes
is
a
common
expression,
the
primary
purpose
is
to
consider
a
property
held
for
production
of
income.
i
think
that
can
be
determined
as
a
question
of
fact
and
if
the
record
supports
it,
that
fact
should
be
conclusive,
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
claims
did
here.
they
had
a
hearing
commissioner
who
have
heard
the
facts,
he
reported
the
facts
and
the
findings
and
the
court
of
claims
accepted
it
as
a
fact
that
the
expenses
were
incurred
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
defending
and
conserving
the
property
that
was
held
for
the
production
of
income
and
not
primarily
for
any
other
purpose
and
the
same
what
--
and
this
--
and
by
the
--
that
finding,
the
court
also
determined
as
a
corollary
that
20%
or
less
of
the
total
expenses
were
incurred
for
matters
proximately
related
to
or
pro
--
for
things
proximately
related
to
personal
matters
such
as
the
divorce
itself
such
as
alimony
which
is
personal
and
houses.
but
that
was
before
the
trier
of
fact,
they
can
see,
there
was
testimony
that
i've
referred
to
some
of
it
in
our
brief
to
show
it
realistically
that
it
is
for
the
trier
of
fact.
now,
there
can
be,
i
can
understand
some
questions
of
mixed
fact
of
the
law
here
but
after
thinking
about
it
very
carefully,
that
was
my
conclusion.
mr.
eli
freed
your
honor,
i
submit
--
mr.
eli
freed
i
submit
that
the
american
people
as
jurors
are
sufficiently
experienced
in
marital
matters
and
in
property
matters
to
exercise
a
fair
judgment
on
the
matter
of
that
kind.
certainly,
you
make
speeches
but
it's
up
to
counsel
in
term
of
what
kind
of
speech
would
be
most
persuasive
in
a
matter
of
that
kind.
mr.
eli
freed
based
upon
evidence
that
is
introduced
before
the
jury
testimony,
there
are
testimonies
in
those
days,
yes,
i
do
think
that
on
the
testimony
in
the
record
of
this
case
for
example,
we
have
one
juror
as
the
commissioner
of
the
court
of
claims.
now,
we
made
arguments
to
him
and
the
fact
that
there'd
be
12
people
that
should
make
a
better
difference
in
my
mind.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
mr.
eli
freed
of
course
that's
an
accepted
procedure.
i
find
that
to
be
a
very
good
way
of
dealing
with
the
problem
of
this
kind.
it
shouldn't
be
left
to
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
i
think.
mr.
eli
freed
i
don't,
your
honor,
add
the
word
primary
to
the
statute.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
mr.
eli
freed
i
used
the
word
primarily
your
honor
in
the
sense
of
dominance
as
the
fact
if
the
trier
of
facts
determines
that
all
of
the
expenses
could
conceivably
be
allocated
to
--
for
example,
the
divorce,
the
trier
of
fact
determines
that
primarily
that
isn't
--
that
the
dominant
motive
and
purpose
of
the
expense
--
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
mr.
eli
freed
yes,
in
that
field,
yes.
it's
not
uncommon
as
your
honor
well
knows
that
expenses
that
are
alleged
to
have
incurred
in
business
that
have
no
business
purpose
and
are
primary
purpose
are
not
allowed.
mr.
eli
freed
not
if
that
was
the
only
issue
between
the
two
but
if
there
were
some
collateral
issue
between
them
as
to
whether
a
--
i
can't
imagine
what
it
might
be
that
it
could
simply
join
two
causes
of
action
together,
some
other
action
in
the
same
procedure.
mr.
eli
freed
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
eli
freed
i
use
it
just
to
take
aim
at
the
target,
i
suppose,
that
it
helps
me
in
--
i
think
it
will
throw
a
little
more
light
on
the
problem.
the
counsel
--
for
the
government
claims
that
these
expenses
should
be
regarded
as
personal
and
because
they
relate
more
to
the
divorce
than
they
do
to
the
property
honestly,
well,
they
relate
primarily
to
the
property
more
than
the
property
--
mr.
eli
freed
--
they
do
with
divorce.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
mr.
eli
freed
the
statute
is
very
simple
just
as
mr.
justice
white
said.
mr.
eli
freed
i
can
agree
with
that.
mr.
eli
freed
i
think
the
statute
--
mr.
eli
freed
i
see
the
red
light.
mr.
eli
freed
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
eli
freed
of
course
not.
mr.
eli
freed
you're
absolutely
right.
we
wouldn't
claim
that
at
all.
mr.
eli
freed
right.
mr.
eli
freed
correct.
mr.
eli
freed
that's
what
the
trier
of
fact
felt
then
i
think
it's
--
mr.
eli
freed
based
on
the
income
--
mr.
eli
freed
the
testimony
--
mr.
eli
freed
your
honor,
i
found
no
reference
in
this
type
of
situation
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
eli
freed
that
of
course
if
for
the
trier
of
fact
that
they
did
--
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
mr.
eli
freed
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent
has
tried
to
emphasize
that
in
california
where
this
case
came
from,
the
husband
and
wife
have
sort
of
a
dual
relationship.
they
have
a
very
definite
and
well-defined
relationship
in
respect
to
their
community
earnings
and
community
property.
it's
like
a
partnership.
and
the
authorities
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief
have
said
so
time
and
again.
the
husband
and
wife,
like
partners,
share
the
gains
and
profits
and
losses
of
the
community
equally.
they
made
contracts
with
each
other
just
as
strangers
may
do
and
may
terminate
their
community
property
relationship
without
terminating
their
marriage.
now,
in
a
divorce
case
such
as
the
one
at
bar,
the
court
had
the
--
they
had
this
at
the
trial
court,
had
before
it
a
number
of
issues
and
one
of
the
things
brought
before
the
court
was
the
accounting
for
the
community
property
of
the
husband
and
wife.
it
wasn't
necessary
that
that
accounting,
preceding,
be
included
in
the
divorce
case.
but
as
i
see
it
because
the
divorce
court
is
a
court
of
equity
and
an
order
to
avoid
the
multiplicity
of
sins,
that
was
the
time
and
place
to
adjudicate
the
community
property
or
marital
partnership,
if
you
will,
relationship
of
the
husband
and
wife.
and
the
findings
of
the
court
of
claims
show
very
clearly
that
there
were
considerable
accounting
procedures
involved.
it
was
the
residue
of
that
accounting
that
mrs.
gilmore
(inaudible)
her
begins
that
because
that
was
the
major
part
of
the
assets.
those
were
the
major
assets
and
that
of
course
is
what
the
case
was
about
as
my
worthy
opponent
had
said.
she
claimed
that
the
increase
in
value
that
is
the
gain
which
would
ultimately
be
taxable,
if
the
court
please,
if
and
when
that
court
--
the
stock
were
disposed
of.
that
gain
comprised
community
property.
it
was
attributable
to
the
skill
and
efforts
of
the
husband
and
that
she
was
entitled
to
half
of
it.
and
it
has
been
conceded
by
the
petitioner
that
finding
30
of
the
court
of
claims
is
to
be
unquestioned.
there's
no
attack
on
it.
and
that
finding
very
clearly
states
and
i
have
referred
to
it
in
the
brief
that
80%
or
more
of
the
amounts
which
don
gilmore
paid
to
his
attorneys
and
his
accountant
were
for
services
rendered
by
them
to
defeat
dixie
gilmore's
claim
to
one-half
of
the
value
of
the
increase
of
the
stock.
that
is
her
claim
that
the
increase
was
community,
and
a
work
community
of
course
she'd
be
entitled
to
one-half
of
it.
now
then
of
course
with
the
--
that
stock
was
properly
held
for
the
production
of
income.
now,
i
have
time
and
time
again
in
studying
this
case,
come
back
to
the
statute.
and
i
think
the
statute
contains
certain
keywords
which
to
me
are
like
needles
of
a
compass
pointing
the
way
to
a
solution
of
this
case.
i
would
like
to
read
the
statute,
the
applicable
words
of
the
statute
here.
section
23
states
that
in
computing
that
income
there
shall
be
allowed
as
deductions
in
the
case
of
an
individual,
all
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
paid
or
incurred
during
the
taxable
year
for
the
production
or
collection
of
income
or
for
the
management,
conservation
or
maintenance
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income.
the
keywords
of
the
statute
in
my
opinion
are
all
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses,
conservation
and
property
held
for
the
production
of
income.
mr.
eli
freed
the
latter
part,
the
--
mr.
eli
freed
--
management
conservation.
yes,
there
was
the
case,
higgins
against
commissioner
in
which
the
--
this
court
had
disallowed
expenses
which
were
incurred
in
relation
to
the
management
of
investments
and
was
regarded
as
inequitable
expenses
which
related
to
definite
income
would
not
be
deductible
in
such
a
case
whereas
expenses
related
to
income
business
would
be
deductible
so
the
statute
was
added
to
correct
that
inequity.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
i'm
in
agreement
and
i
believe
that
that
very
--
that
the
philosophy
and
purpose
of
adding
that
portion
to
the
statute
is
quite
significant
here.
congress
saw
that
would
--
that
it
would
be
inequitable
not
to
allow
the
deduction
of
expenses
which
relate
not
only
to
the
production
of
income
but
relate
to
the
conservation
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income
because
when
one
conserves
property
held
for
the
production
of
income,
actually,
you're
conserving
the
income
which
will
be
taxable.
so
that
is
a
cohesive
statute
as
i
see
it.
and
this
court
has
laid
down
a
rule
which
can
be
followed
in
this
case
and
i
think
should
be
followed
in
this
case
and
in
the
case
of
trust
against
bingham
--
trust
--
bingham
trust
often
cited
--
the
trust
of
bingham
or
bingham's
trust,
and
i
referred
to
it
in
the
briefs.
objections
were
made
in
the
bingham's
trust
case
that
certain
attorney's
fees
that
were
incurred
to
defend
against
the
proposed
income
tax
deficiency
were
not
deductible
because
those
expenses
were
not
incurred
to
produce
income.
it's
very
interesting
that
of
that
juncture
in
the
history
of
the
statute,
that
the
internal
revenue
service
gave
way
so
--
they
gave
way
reluctantly.
they
insisted
that
--
that
in
order
for
expenses
to
be
deductible
they
had
to
be
not
only
for
the
conservation
or
management
of
property
held
production
income
but
also
they
had
to
produce
income.
the
tax
court
disagreed
with
the
commissioner
for
internal
revenue.
the
second
circuit
reversed
the
tax
court,
agreeing
with
the
commissioner
and
this
court
ruled
otherwise
and
affirmed
the
tax
court.
and
mr.
chief
justice
stone
speaking
for
the
court
stated
that
the
objections
made
by
the
commissioner
failed
to
take
proper
account
of
the
plain
language
of
23
(a)
(2).
and
the
purpose
of
the
section
disclosed
by
the
statutory
setting
and
the
legislative
history
referred
too
here.
i'd
like
to
quote
from
the
opinion,
“the
requirement
of
section
23
(a)
(2),
the
deductible
expenses
be
“ordinary
and
necessary”
implies,
and
those
are
the
keywords
ordinary
and
necessary,
implies
that
they
must
be
reasonable
in
amount
and
must
bear
a
reasonable
and
proximate
relation
to
the
management
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income”.
and
to
me,
if
the
court
please,
that's
an
understandable
rule
of
law.
they
are
the
words
that
are
often
used,
often
followed
by
the
courts.
and
they
have
a
standard
of
understanding
that
can
be
followed.
that
is
that
all
ordinary
and
necessary
in
place
of
the
--
must
be
reasonable
in
amount
and
must
bear
a
reasonable
and
approximate
relation
to
the
management
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income.
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
ordinarily,
questions
of
reasonableness
and
proximity
are
for
the
trier
of
fact.
and
it's
very
hard
to
lay
down
a
rule
in
a
case
of
this
kind
that
doesn't
that
again
go
back
to
the
reliance
upon
the
trier
of
fact,
in
this
case,
the
court
of
claims
and
other
cases
of
the
tax
court.
and
the
counsel
interestingly
enough
has
referred
to
the
case
of
kornhauser
against
the
united
states
in
sustaining
his
position
and
we
regard
it
as
being
very
strong
authority
supporting
our
position.
mr.
eli
freed
kornhauser
against
the
united
states,
decided
by
this
court
in
1928.
now
we
have
gone
to
some
things
to
point
out
the
parallelism
of
the
two
cases
in
our
brief
and
i
have
even
pointed
out
that
a
case
of
that
kind
could
occur
in
a
divorce
case
that
husband
and
wife
being
law
partners,
as
visible
partners
were
could've
--
had
it
--
have
been
involved
in
a
litigation,
involved
in
the
accounting
for
community
earnings
that
had
been
stock.
and
i
think
it's
not
too
difficult
to
see
that
on
the
fact
that
the
cases
are
quite
parallel
and
that
the
law
partner
who
sued
the
other
claims
that
the
--
that
the
stock
held
by
his
former
partner
consisted
of
these
earnings
received
for
services
performed
by
the
partnership.
that
is
while
this
man
was
a
partner.
and
the
attorney
--
the
law
partner
who
sued
to
be
successful
in
that
case,
he
incurred
attorney's
fees
and
he
deducted
them
from
his
income
and
the
internal
revenue
service
at
that
time
claimed
that
since
the
partnership
terminated
the
expenses
that
were
incurred
were
personal
in
character.
and
that
therefore
they
were
not
deductible.
this
court
held
--
as
the
court
held
in
bingham's
trust
as
i
see
it,
that
the
expenses
of
attorney's
fees
incurred
in
kornhauser
proximately
related
to
the
partnership
and
we
think
that
the
attorney's
fees
in
the
case
of
baer
were
attorney's
fees
that
approximately
related
to
the
community
partnership,
the
marital
partnership.
mr.
eli
freed
i'm
thinking
about
that.
i
couldn't
conclude
that
it
would
happen
in
every
case.
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
each
case.
mr.
eli
freed
yes,
even
though
--
mr.
eli
freed
in
a
--
i
would
like
to
answer
that
in
the
context
of
this
case.
in
the
community
property
dispute
between
a
husband
and
wife
which
is
included
in
the
divorce
action.
if
the
services
that
were
rendered
by
attorneys
could
be
identified
as
services
to
protect
the
income
producing
property
that
the
peculiar
--
a
future
nature
of
the
property
was
such
that
a
court
could
clearly
conclude
that
they
were
rendered
to
conserve
such
property,
i
would
say
that
they
were
clearly
deductible
and
that
was
the
intent
of
the
statute.
mr.
eli
freed
yes,
i
would
say
that
in
most
instances
the
--
when
the
marriage
is
finished
so
to
speak,
they
go
to
court
and
what
they
fight
about
is
the
property,
that's
true.
mr.
eli
freed
yes,
that's
inevitably
the
case.
now
in
common
law
states,
the
rule
might
be
--
the
result
might
possibly
be
different
because
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
case
with
united
states
against
davis
decided
by
this
court
in
june
of
this
year
that
the
situation
could
be
different
in
common
law
states
although
the
issue
in
that
case
was
not
like
this
one
here,
nevertheless
it's
pointed
out
that
when
the
wife
makes
a
claim
against
the
husband
in
certain
states,
i
think
that
was
the
state
of
delaware.
she
is
attempting
to
burden
the
husband's
property
with
an
obligation
similar
to
the
obligation
of
support.
now
if
that
is
so
since
the
husband
has
an
obligation
to
support
his
wife
because
of
his
marital
relationship,
purely
because
of
the
marital
relationship.
in
other
words,
when
he
con
--
when
he
marries
her,
he
contracts
a
supporter,
and
that's
personal
i
believe.
and
if
that
is
so
that
she
is
claiming
for
this
property
to
satisfy
that
kind
of
an
obligation,
i
think
that
would
be
personal.
whereas
in
the
community
property
state
like
california
and
others
as
such
states,
the
wife
is
the
--
ask
the
husband
to
account
for
her
share
of
the
community.
she
is
not
attempting
to
burden
his
share
of
the
community
at
least
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
in
respect
to
the
finding
which
the
counsel
concedes
that
she
was
merely
80%
or
more
of
the
attorney's
fees
were
incurred
to
defeat
her
claims
to
one-half,
not
more
than
one-half.
in
other
words,
she
wasn't
claiming
more
than
one-half
and
she
wasn't
attempting
to
burden
his
property.
mr.
eli
freed
yes,
the
--
yes,
the
wife
assumed
that
the
court
of
claims
considered
that
very
carefully.
and
the
--
they're
--
it's
a
mature
learned
court
and
they
concluded
that
the
attorneys
had
made
quite
an
accomplishment
in
defeating
her
claim
to
the
community
and
that
80%
or
more
of
the
fees
was
justifiably
attributable
to
such
services.
mr.
eli
freed
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
eli
freed
that's
right.
and
in
this
particular
case,
these
securities
were
of
a
peculiar
nature.
they
had
incidents
which
could
have
deprived
him
of
income,
not
of
--
we
might
go
and
step
further
as
a
practical
matter
and
(inaudible)
--
deprive
this
government
of
revenue.
because
he
didn't
have
the
income,
he
wouldn't
have
taxes
to
pay.
and
that's
how
--
that's
the
philosophy
of
the
internal
revenue
law,
trying
to
tax
income
and
allow
deductions
from
income
when
proximately
related
to
the
production
of
such
income
either
by
the
services
or
by
the
property
which
produces
such
income.
that's
the
way
i
see
it.
mr.
eli
freed
in
other
words,
would
he
had
lost?
mr.
eli
freed
lost
the
property,
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
i
don't
see
why
not.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
so
long
as
he
(inaudible)
--
he
actually
--
and
the
court
--
the
trial
court
finds
that
he
actually
did
incur
those
expenses
to
conserve
his
income
producing
property,
well,
i
think
that
is
for
--
if
the
trier
of
fact
so
found,
i
think
we
should
follow
that.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
mr.
eli
freed
surely
do.
and
we
--
mr.
eli
freed
yes,
i
think
the
government
--
the
commissioner
is
actually
admitted
to
that
--
that
regulation
that
your
honor
referred
to.
mr.
eli
freed
yes,
that's
a
clear
admission
--
mr.
eli
freed
its
23
(a)
--
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
it's
a
23
(a)
(2)
expense
that
is
incurred
and
that
referred
to
in
that
regulation.
oh,
wait
a
minute
now
--
well,
if
(inaudible)
of
income,
if
the
wife
tries
to
collect
alimony
through
her
attorney
and
incurs
attorney's
fees.
in
a
divorce
case,
she's
allowed
to
deduct
those
attorney's
fees.
mr.
eli
freed
yes.
that's
right.
and
it
isn't
the
source
and
nature
of
the
--
that
isn't
the
source
at
least,
of
the
claim
that
she
makes
that
determines
that
whether
such
expense
is
deductible
because
obviously
the
source
there
is
the
divorce,
because
the
alimony
and
the
divorce
go
together.
but
in
the
case
that
--
in
my
argument,
i'm
trying
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
separate
in
this
between
the
community
property
relationships.
there's
a
great
separateness
not
entirely
so
but
there
is
the
very
substantial
and
practical
separateness
between
the
community
property
relationship
and
the
marital
relationship
that
i've
pointed
out
in
the
brief
that
california
has
been
criticized
or
that
is
to
say
people
have
been
criticized
--
have
criticized
community
property
states
for
enacting
statutes
which,
in
fact,
create
a
business
relationship
between
the
husband
and
wife
which
later
contends
as
a
sort
of
a
violation
of
the
holy
sacrament.
but
nevertheless
it
exists
that
the
statute
has
created
that
situation
in
california
with
baer
(inaudible).
now
in
relation
--
in
regard
to
the
capital
expenses,
i
think
that
kornhauser
is
also
authority
our
way,
(inaudible)
they
point
them
out
withstanding.
in
kornhauser,
the
law
partners
sued
his
former
law
partner
for
a
part
of
the
stock
that
which
he
claimed
had
been
received
for
services
rendered
by
him
as
a
law
partner.
and
the
internal
revenue
service
claimed
in
the
kornhauser
case
that
that
expense
was
deductible
not
only
because
it
was
personal
because
--
but
also
because
of
this
capital
that
was
for
the
protection
of
the
ownership
of
the
stock.
and
this
court
held
against
that
and
other
cases
have
thrown
light
on
that
subject
by
saying
that
if
the
primary
purpose
of
the
litigation
is
in
accounting
in
a
nature
of
a
disclosure
and
a
reporting
of
income
and
expenses
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
certain
result
as
to
what
share
the
--
say
the
party
--
what
shares
the
party
should
have
in
the
particular
property
that
is
not
a
suit
to
acquire
a
title,
it's
not
a
suit
--
and
when
the
defender
is
not
a
suit
to
defend
the
title,
it
has
indirect
incidence
with
titles
but
that's
not
the
purpose
of
it.
and
the
regulation
i'd
like
to
point
out
which
is
referred
to
time
and
again
a
number
of
ways
under
different
sections.
the
regulation
state
that
expenses
in
defense
of
title
or
to
establish
title
are
not
deductible.
we
don't
have
that
situation
here.
thank
you.
