the
latter
case
that
would
not
have
been
community
(voice

--
justice

justice
potter
stewart
--
nature
of
argument
there.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
claim
or
cross
complaint
or
whatever
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
right
in
my
understanding
that
under
the
involved,
california
is
actionable
if
the
court
had
found
that
the
advantage
of
divorce
based
upon
the
husband's
aggression
then
the
wife
is
entitled
to
at
least
50%
of
any
community
property?
did
i
understand
that
correctly
from
the
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
please
do.
justice
potter
stewart
50%
of
the
community
property.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
more
than
50.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
was
that
discretionary
with
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
divorce
is
granted
as
it
was
upon
the
basis
of
the
--
on
the
grounds
of
wife's
strong
doing
then
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
court,
is
it,
whether
or
not
to
grant
any
--
grant
her
anything,
any
of
the
community
property
or
is
he
limited
in
what
he
can
grant?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
he
--
could
he
--
could
the
court
in
his
discretion
have
granted
even
though
based
upon
her
fault,
even
though
the
divorce
has
been
based
upon
her
fault
or
guilt
or
aggression,
could
the
court
in
his
discretion
even
so
have
granted
her
some
or
all
of
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
up
to
50
%.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
