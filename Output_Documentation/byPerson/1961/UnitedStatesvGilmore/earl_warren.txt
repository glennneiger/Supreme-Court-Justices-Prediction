mr.

--
mr.
freed,
does
your
theory
carry
to
this
conclusion
that
in
litigation
of
this
kind,
the
jury
is
called
upon
to
determine
how
important
the
divorce
is
to
the
parties
and
how
important
the
division
of
property
is
in
order
to
determine
this
question?

may
answer
it

mr.
barnett,
yesterday
afternoon,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
a
question
that
--
concerning
something
that
i
think
it
was
not
in
your
--
in
your
briefs.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
thought
it
might
possibly
call
for
a
memorandum
and
i
wonder
if
justice
harlan
would
repeat
the
question
to
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course,
mr.

you
may
reply
to
the
memorandum
if
you
desire.

just
one
minute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barnett,
would
you
state
just
very
briefly
again
what
you
ask
us
to
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
ask
us
to
hold
it
that
none
of
it
was
deductible.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
i

understand
that.

justice
earl
warren
mr.

justice
earl
warren
mr.
freed,
if
this
case
had
been
decided
either

if
the
wife
had
been
exonerated
and
the
divorce
had
been
granted
because
of
the
respondent's
adultery,
would
your
position
be
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
--
if
he
lost
--
lost
the
--

justice
earl
warren
