mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
patrick
case
that
follow
it
are
income
tax
cases.
they
--
they
involve
the
deductibility
by
husband
of
the
expenses
of
resisting
or
compromising
a
wife's
claims
against
him
for
property
in
a
divorce
proceeding.
in
both
cases,
deductions
were
allowed
by
the
lower
courts
under
section
23
(a)
of
the
1939
code
and
the
corresponding
provisions
of
the
1954
code.
those
provisions
allow
a
deduction
for
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
paid
or
incurred
in
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business
or
for
the
production
or
collection
of
income
or
for
the
management,
conservation
or
maintenance
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income.
the
ground
for
allowing
the
deductions
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
the
gilmore
case,
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i'm
--
my
introduction
is
to
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes,
rate
the
two
together.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
ground
for
allowing
the
deductions
was
that,
unless
the
wife's
claim
was
defeated
and
the
husband
was
required
to
pay
what
the
wife
sought,
he
would
have
to
dispose
of
his
income
producing
property
in
order
to
be
able
to
pay
her.
now,
our
position
is
that
the
characterization
of
an
expense,
of
resisting
a
claim
depends
upon
the
nature
and
source
of
the
claim
asserted
and
not
upon
the
consequences
of
having
to
satisfy
it
if
a
judgment
--
an
adverse
judgment
should
be
entered.
that
is
if
the
claim
arises
out
of
the
business
transaction,
the
cost
of
that
depend
in
it
is
deductible
even
though
the
judgment,
if
granted,
will
expend
itself
on
personal
assets,
just
your
home
or
life
insurance
policies.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
claim
asserted,
arises
out
of
the
personal
transaction,
the
cost
is
not
deductible.
it's
a
personal
expense
even
though
the
judgment
might
expend
itself
on
business
assets.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
absent
--
something
that
i
can't
foresee,
but
i
--
i
am
prepared
to
say,
no
expenses
in
a
divorce
proceeding.
this
case,
the
gilmore
case,
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
claims.
it
involves
a
divorce
proceeding
in
the
courts
of
california.
the
--
mr.
gilmore
and
dixie
gilmore
were
married
in
1946.
in
1952,
after
six
years
of
marriage,
mrs.
gilmore
filed
a
suit
for
divorce
and
mr.
gilmore
counterclaimed
for
divorce.
so
there
was
no
issue
between
the
parties
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
this
is
the
automobile
dealer.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
marriage
should
be
terminated.
the
only
dispute
between
the
parties
which
is
true
in
virtually
all
divorce
cases
is
over
the
money
questions.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
--
i
think,
certainly,
all
of
those
that
have
come
up
in
the
tax
area
that
has
been
true
and
i
--
i
come
from
nevada.
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i
--
well
i
--
i'll
withdraw
the
statement.
at
least
in
many
divorce
cases,
the
main
issue
is
not
about
terminating
the
divorce
but
terminating
the
marriage
by
about
tax
property
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
yes,
that
certainly
is
true.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
one
of
the
elements
of
the
court
of
claims
justification
for
allowing
the
expense
was
that
the
charge
is
made
against
him,
if
not
refuted,
would
tarnish
his
reputation,
general
motors
might
be
led,
because
of
that,
cancels
his
franchise.
let
--let
me
spell
out
the
facts
of
it
before
i
--
i
come
to
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
that
is
a
more
indirect
consequence
of
the
assertion
of
the
claim
upon
his
income-producing
capacity.
i
suppose
it's
true
that
there
are
--
are
--
a
great
many
jobs
in
which
your
income-producing
capacity
will
be
affected
by
personal
challenges
to
your
moral
character.
well,
the
property
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
if
i
may
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
didn't
work
this
out.
this
is
thought
out.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
let
--
i
will
try
to
separate
the
elements
involved
in
the
litigation.
his
property,
besides
a
yacht
and
two
homes,
consisted
almost
entirely
of
his
stock
and
controlling
interest
varying
between
60%
and
100%
in
three
corporations.
each
corporation
was
a
franchise
dealer
for
general
motor
--
motors'
automobiles.
don
gilmore-san
francisco
and
don
gilmore-hayward
were
chevrolet
dealers
and
don
gilmore-riverside,
the
third
corporation,
was
a
pontiac
dealer.
he
was
also
the
president
and
managing
officer
of
the
three
corporations.
he
was
paid
for
his
services
compensations
from
the
three
corporations
averaging
about
$67,000
a
year.
he
got
dividends
in
three
corporations
averaging
about
$83,000
a
year.
his
total
compensation
from
the
three
corporations,
both
dividends
and
salary,
average
about
$150,000
a
year.
now,
the
main
issue
in
the
case
was
the
fight
about
community
property.
when
mr.
gilmore
and
dixie
gilmore
were
married
in
1956,
mr.
gilmore
was
then
56
years
of
age
and
had
been
in
the
automobile
business
for
about
30
years
and
already
owned
the
stock
in
these
three
corporations.
admittedly,
at
that
time,
they
were
separate
property
and
not
community
property
under
california
law.
mrs.
gilmore,
however,
asserted
that
since
--
well,
the
stock
at
--
at
the
time
of
marriage
worth
only
$200,000.
that
was
1946.
by
1952,
largely
because
of
the
postwar
boom
in
the
automobile
business,
the
stock
was
worth
$800,000.
dixie
gilmore
claimed
that
the
appreciation
in
the
stock
was
attributable
to
the
husband's
personal
services
and
therefore
part
of
it
constituted
community
property.
the
husband
resisted
that
claim.
the
settlement
negotiation
actually
never
really
got
under
way.
mrs.
gilmore
demanded
half
of
the
total
appreciation
$300,000
in
cash.
mr.
gilmore
was
advised
by
his
attorneys
that
he
was
on
solid
ground
and
he
countered
by
offering
her
$10,000
for
everything
and
that's
where
the
negotiation
began
and
stopped.
the
case
then
went
to
trial.
now,
the
issues
of
the
trial
were
first,
this
issue
about
community
property.
there
--
there
is
a
doctrine
in
california
law,
as
i
understand
it
--
basically
community
property
is
the
--
the
proceeds
of
the
personal
efforts
of
the
parties
during
the
marriage.
there
is
a
doctrine
that
you
can
go
behind
the
stockholdings
of
a
closely
held
corporation
to
make
sure
that
the
appreciation
and
the
value
of
the
stockholdings
isn't
really
due
to
the
personal
efforts
of
the
husband
which
he
hasn't
been
adequately
compensated
for
by
--
in
--
by
way
of
salary.
so,
there
are
--
one
of
the
disputes
was
about
how
you
made
this
determination
whether
there
was
a
community
property
held
back
in
the
corporation.
mrs.
gilmore
contended
that
you
first
attribute
a
fair
return
to
the
investment
and
treat
everything
else
as
resulting
from
his
personal
efforts.
his
position
was
that
you
simply
determine
whether
the
salary
paid
him
was
more
than
ample
compensation
for
his
personal
efforts
and
treat
the
rest
of
the
appreciation
as
the
product
of
a
fortunate
investment.
he
was
ultimately
sustained
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
that
case,
i
don't
think
there's
any
real
dispute.
the
salary
that
he
was
paid
was
in
fact
more
than
ample
for
--
for
the
fairly
nominal
services,
at
least
the
court
of
claims
has
now
so
found.
they
don't
think
it
was
really
--
he
was
paid
tidy
sum
and
that
left
all
the
other
appreciation
attributable
to
simply
the
postwar
inflation
of
his
--
his
original
investment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
was
a
separate
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct
but
for
--
that
is
what
the
california
supreme
court
held
in
this
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
no,
no,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
was
just
trying
to
explain
what
the
nature
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
nature
of
the
dispute
was.
secondly,
if
there
was
community
property,
there
was
a
question
how
it
would
be
divided.
under
california
law,
it's
divided
equally
only
if
the
parties
are
equally
at
fault.
if
only
one
party
is
at
fault,
the
court
is
required
to
award
the
innocent
party
more
than
50%
and
may
award
all
of
the
community
property
to
the
innocent
party.
so
it's
important
in
the
trial
also
to
establish
that
the
wife
was
at
fault
in
case
there
was
community
property.
the
other
--
the
other
money
issue
was
alimony
and
that
depended
entirely
on
the
question
of
who
is
at
fault.
if
the
wife
was
granted
a
divorce,
she
would
be
entitled
to
alimony.
the
husband
was
granted
divorce
and
the
wife
was
not
granted
a
--
a
divorce,
she
would
not
be
entitled
to
alimony
and
if
she
got
alimony,
the
amount
of
alimony
would
of
course
depend
upon
their
relative
equities.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right,
cross-complaint
for
divorce
by
the
husband.
so
the
--
the
case
went
to
trial
with
those
issues
being
drawn
between
the
parties.
i
don't
want
to
dwell
at
length
in
the
nature
of
the
trial
which
was
described
by
the
intermediate
appellate
court
as
one
of
the
most
sorted
and
revolting
that
that
court
ever
dealt
with.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
you
might
ask
my
opponent.
i
--
i
don't
know.
the
--
however,
the
main
expense
involved
here
is
the
expense
of
running
that
trial
and
in
addition,
this
element
of
the
necessity
to
protect
his
reputation
was
offered
as
one
of
the
justifications
below
so
i
think
--
i
should
suggest
very
briefly
what
the
nature
of
the
trial
was.
what
was
it
all
about?
the
wife
charged
the
husband
with
numerous
acts
of
adultery
with
various
other
women
and
also
with
--
with
physical
and
verbal
abuse.
the
husband
charged
the
wife
of
having
become
an
alcoholic
during
the
marriage
and
with
--
in
public
often
calling
him
by
all
names
and
hitting
him
and
so
forth.
the
wife
admitted
her
alcohol
--
addiction
to
alcohol,
but
attributed
to
--
to
her
(inaudible)
at
suggestions
made
by
him
that
she
engage
in
abnormal
sex
acts
with
other
women
in
his
presence.
he
countered
that
--
that
she
did
that
on
her
own
and
his
role
was
solely
that
of
a
bystander
or
observer.
it
was
--
these
charges
and
countercharges
that
took
up
24
days
of
trial
and
filled
3000
pages
of
transcript
with
the
--
that
included
the
formal
proof
on
the
community
property
show
cause.
the
outcome
--
the
outcome
of
the
trial
was
a
complete
victory
for
mr.
gilmore.
he
was
granted
a
divorce.
his
wife
was
denied
divorce.
the
judge
first
awarded
the
wife
$9000
a
year
alimony,
but
on
--
on
mr.
gilmore's
motion,
he
acknowledged
that
having
denied
the
wife
a
divorce,
he
couldn't
award
her
alimony.
the
wife
was
held
--
have
a
joint
interest
in
the
two
houses.
they're
held
in
joint
tenancy.
in
fact,
they
were
heavily
mortgaged
and
she
had
no
money
to
pay
the
--
the
payments
on
and
it
was
soon
foreclosed
and
the
husband
bought
back
the
houses
and
the
foreclosure.
so
the
wife
ended
up
with
nothing.
on
the
wife's
appeal,
the
court
of
--
the
intermediate
court
--
appellate
court
in
california
reversed
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial
because
it
thought
the
trial
court
did
not
gave
an
adequate
weight
to
the
proven
adul
--
adultery
of
her
husband.
the
california
supreme
court
on
the
--
mr
gilmore's
further
appeal,
however,
reinstated
the
judgment
since
the
adultery
occurred
after
the
initial
filing
of
the
divorce
suit,
the
lower
court
hadn't
abused
its
discretion
in
weighing
all
the
factors
and
not
giving
a
divorce
also
to
mrs.
gilmore.
so
the
final
result
was,
mr.
gilmore
got
--
got
the
divorce
and
mrs.
gilmore
got
not
--
not
a
cent.
in
1953
and
1954
in
carrying
on
this
litigation,
mr.
gilmore
paid
out
as
attorney's
fees
and
other
court
costs
of
$40,600.
he
claimed
the
deduction
for
those
payments
on
his
return
as
ordinary
necessary
expenses
of
conserving
income-producing
property.
the
commissioner
disallowed
it.
he
brought
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
for
refund.
the
court
of
claims
held
that
80%
of
the
total
fees
could
be
deducted
under
section
23
(a)
(2).
i
might
explain
what
the
80%
is.
the
costs
were
all
lump
together.
they
weren't
segregated,
i
mean,
services
or
anything
else.
the
allocation
was
arrived
at
by
judging
the
relative
importance
of
the
several
objects
sought
to
be
achieved
in
the
trial.
now,
there
are
perhaps
five
objects
to
be
--
to
be
achieved
in
the
trial.
the
two
were
treated
as
not
being
the
basis
for
a
deduction,
were
the
object
of
terminating
the
marriage
relationship
and
the
object
of
defeating
the
wife's
claims
to
alimony.
the
purposes
at
the
trial
that
it
thought
warranted
a
deduction
for
the
expenses
allocated
to
them
was
the
purpose
to
establish
that
there
was
no
community
property
to
establish
that
if
there
was
community
property,
the
wife
being
at
fault
should
be
awarded
only
a
minor
part
of
it.
and
finally,
the
purpose
at
the
trial
by
refuting
the
wife's
charges
against
him
to
minimize
the
impact
on
his
reputation
which
he
allegedly
feared
might
cost
general
motors
to
cancel
his
franchises.
so
we
have
a
finding
in
$32,000
of
the
total
was
allocable
to
the
purposes
of
defeating
the
claims
to
community
property
and
to
protecting
his
reputation
against
these
charges
that
had
been
made.
the
court
of
claims
in
allowing
the
deduction
doesn't
deny
that
the
origin
of
the
claims
being
having
originated
entirely
from
the
marriage.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
$40,600,
i
--
i
drop
the
$600.
$40,000
total
for
the
two
years
involved
here.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
court
of
claims
said
80%
across
the
board,
80%
of
the
$40,000
is
$32,000.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
allocation
made
among
the
objects.
it
wasn't
a
matter
of
identifying
expenses
but
just
allocating
the
purposes
sought
to
be
served.
in
finding
the
--
that
the
expenses
were
deductible,
the
court
of
claims
did
not
deny
that
the
wife's
claims
having
arisen
for
marriage
relationship
were
personal
in
origin.
the
nexus
it
found
between
the
expense
and
the
income-producing
property
was
this.
if
the
wife
succeeded
in
her
claims
and
if
the
wife
were
awarded
$300,000,
which
was
her
initial
claim
either
in
cash
or
in
stock,
either
way
he
would
have
to
dispose
a
large
part
of
his
controlling
interest
in
these
corporations
either
directly
to
her
or
by
selling
to
raise
the
money
to
give
to
her.
that
further
created
the
risk
that
the
change
of
the
capital
ownership
might
cost
general
motors
to
cancel
the
franchise
if
indeed
it
hadn't
already
cancelled
the
franchise
because
of
the
publicity
given
to
the
trial.
therefore,
he
would
be
out
of
the
job,
this
very
lucrative
and,
by
his
own
assertion,
overpaid
job
as
president
of
the
three
corporations.
in
short,
because
the
--
the
--
the
assertion
of
the
claim,
if
it
were
upheld
then
adverse
judgment
entered
would
have
expended
itself
upon
property
that
he
held
for
the
production
of
income.
the
fact
that
the
property
--
the
only
property
had
yet
was
income-producing
property
may
be
expensive.
now,
i
would
first
very
briefly
like
--
like
--
well
let
me
--
let
me
simply
say
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
established
that
23
(a)
(1)
and
(a)
(2)
really
served
no
different
purposes.
23
(a)
(1)
is
trade
or
business
expenses.
trade
or
business
was
limited
by
some
earlier
decisions
of
the
court
to
a
very
narrowly
defined
time
of
activity.
you
had
to
be
engaged
in
a
full
time
occupation
to
be
allowed
expenses
of
any
profit
making
activities.
not
all
business
transactions,
the
court
said
were
deductible
under
23
(a)
(1)
alone.
23
(a)
(2)
was
added
in
1942
for
the
purpose
of
removing
that
limitation.
any
income-producing
activities
even
though
sporadic
such
--
or
not
of
a
kind
formerly
thought
to
be
a
true
trade
or
business,
such
as
managing
your
own
investments
are
now
a
basis
for
deduction.
in
fact,
the
court
of
claims
since
it
relies
upon
the
threat
to
his
job
and
since
the
job
is
a
trade
or
business
its
decisions
might
as
well
be
placed
under
23
(a)
(1)
as
under
(a)
(2).
i
will
talk
of
all
of
the
expenses
as
business
expenses
without
distinguishing
between
the
two
subsections.
the
question
is
how
you
decide
whether
an
expense
is
resisting
a
liability
or
compromising
it,
is
personal
on
the
one
hand
or
business
on
the
other
hand.
what
is
the
aspect
of
the
expense
that
determines
its
characterization?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
would
like
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
explain
that.
the
regulations
1
(11)
--
this
--
this
history
by
the
way
is
not
on
our
brief.
i
just
discovered
it
apparently
in
the
oral
argument.
regulations
1
(11)
issued
in
1943
had
provided
flatly
that
attorney's
fees
paid
in
a
suit
for
separation
are
not
deductible
from
gross
income
and
that
with
no
exceptions,
there
was
no
qualifications.
in
two
tax
court
decisions,
gale
v.
commissioner,
13
tax
court
and
lamont
v.
commissioner
also
a
13
tax
court,
the
full
tax
court
said,
“well
in
case
of
the
wise
expenses
of
getting
an
agreement
to
pay
her
periodic
payments
as
alimony,
her
expenses
allocatable
to
that
are
deductible
because
the
statute
makes
periodic
payments
of
income
to
the
wife,
that's
section
23
(k),
taxes
to
the
wife
periodic
payments.
therefore,
her
--
her
extent
in
getting
periodic
payments
has
to
be
allowed
as
a
deduction
under
section
23
(a)
(2)
as
an
expense
incurred
for
the
production
or
collection
of
the
income
since
the
statute
makes
alimony
income
to
her,
solely
that.
then
–“
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
--
well
i
--
i've
got
--
i
--
it's
a
little
more
precise
than
that.
the
commissioner
acquiesced
in
those
--
he'd
opposed
that
construction,
he
acquiesced
in
those
issued
treasury
decision
5889
1952-1
cumulative
bulletin
31
which
says
this.
“in
order
to
conform
regulations
1
(11)
to
the
decision
of
the
tax
court
in
those
cases,
it
is
amended
as
follows
and
it
puts
in
that
generally
they're
not
allowable
as
to
however
to
take
care
of
the
alimony
problem
in
the
tax
court
case”
and
that's
the
only
qualification
ever
intended
to
the
disallowance
of
divorce
suit.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
respondent's
litigation
cost,
the
nature
and
character
which
i
described
yesterday,
are
to
be
treated
as
the
cost
of
his
marriage
or
the
cost
of
his
business
or
the
relationships
of
his
marriage
or
the
cost
of
his
business.
the
relationships
to
each
are
clear.
the
claims
asserted
arose
out
of
the
marriage.
they
depended
entirely
upon
the
marriage
relationship
and
came
from
the
marriage
relationship.
the
claims,
if
successful,
would
extend
themselves
on
the
business
either
by
taking
his
business
assets,
causing
him
to
lose
his
franchise
or
his
job.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
quarrel
with
--
we
did
not,
we
did
not
raise
a
question
about
the
allocation.
there
--
it's
a
rather
defective
allocation
in
our
view
but
--
now,
the
question
is
which
aspect
of
the
claim,
its
source
or
its
consequence
controls
this
characterization
as
personal
business
and
we
contend
that
it's
the
source
of
the
claim
that
makes
no
difference
on
how
it's
going
to
be
paid
if
you
happen
to
lose
the
lawsuit.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
i
understand.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
wish
to
distinguish
a
claim
by
her
that
there
is
community
property
and
litigation
over
that
claim
and
conceded
community
property
and
the
litigation
over
the
partition
of
it.
the
first,
i
would
say
is
personal
and
it's
not
deductible
for
that
reason.
she
is
asserting
a
claim
arising
from
her
status
as
being
a
wife
that
there
is
community
property
to
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
the
assertion
that
there
is
community
property
is
in
this
case
and
i
say
that's
personal.
that
derived
from
the
marriage
relationship.
if
you
can
see
that
there
is
community
property
which
is
true
in
the
fifth
circuit
case,
the
owens
case
and
that
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
dividing,
i
would
say
the
expenses
are
capital
not
that
that
they're
nondeductible
because
they're
capital
and
not
because
they're
personal.
they're
nondeductible
either
way.
actually,
i
think
you'll
find
that
the
patrick
case
involves
more
of
the
capital
problem
than
this
case.
now,
i
think
the
principle
that
you
look
to
the
source
and
nature
of
the
claim
and
not
to
the
consequences
is
as
firmly
established
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
is
possible
for
any
doctrine
of
tax
law
to
be
established.
one
of
the
earliest
tax
cases
on
business
expenses
is
the
kornhauser
case
decided
back
in
278,
i
believe,
u.s.
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
that
involved
the
converse
situation.
a
--
the
taxpayer
was
formerly
the
partner
of
a
law
office.
after
he
resigned
from
the
partnership,
he
was
sued
by
his
former
partner
claiming
that
he'd
received
fees
for
services
that
perform
--
during
the
partnership
for
which
he
was
required
to
account
to
the
other
partner
that
he
has
been
receiving
in
a
form
of
a
stock.
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
argued
that
he
was
no
longer
in
the
business
and
that
he
was
really
just
defending
some
property
he
happened
to
own,
the
stock
and
therefore,
the
expense
is
capital
or
personal.
i'm
happy
to
say
that
the
solicitor
general
disassociated
himself
from
that
argument
and
filed
a
brief
taking
the
other
view.
the
court
held
that
since
the
claim
asserted
arose
from
his
former
business
activities,
the
expense
of
defending
it
were
deductible
and
the
fact
that
the
claim
would
expend
itself
only
what
--
on
what
was
now
personal
assets
was
irrelevant.
now,
more
directly
in
point
is
the
recent
decision
in
the
lykes
case
which
involved
this
side
of
the
coin
--
lykes,
that's
in
343
u.s.,
a
gift
tax
deficiency
was
asserted
against
mr.
lykes.
mr.
lykes
is
the
president
of
a
family
owned
corporation.
he
made
gifts
of
stock
in
that
corporation
to
his
wife
and
children
and
reported
them
for
gift
tax
purpose.
the
commissioner
thought
he'd
under
valued
the
stock
and
asserted
a
deficiency
of
$150,000
based
on
the
issue
evaluation.
the
issue
evaluation
went
to
the
tax
court
and
is
finally
settled
by
agreement
by
paying
the
$15,000
additional
deficiency.
now,
mr.
lykes
claimed
the
deduction
under
the
same
provision
involved
here.
one
of
his
arguments
was
that
if
he'd
have
to
pay
$150,000,
he
would've
had
to
liquidate
his
remaining
holdings
in
the
family
corporation
which
was
the
main
source
of
income
and
therefore,
it's
a
direct
and
immediate
threat
on
his
income
producing
property.
this
court
said
in
an
unmistakably
clear
terms
that
it
is
solely
the
source
and
nature
of
the
claim
and
it
makes
no
difference
that
if
you
just
--
the
defense
is
unsuccessful,
it
will
consume
income
producing
property.
i
might
say
that
this
seems
to
me
--
obviously
necessary
result.
once
you
consider
the
corollary
problem
which
you
have
a
claim
arising
from
business
transaction,
does
it
make
a
difference
that
you've
retired
and
all
of
the
property
you
have
is
personal
property
like
home,
life
insurance
policies,
there
is
no
threat
to
your
income
producing
activities.
of
course
you
can
deduct
the
expense
of
descending
a
claim
that
arose
from
your
business
transactions.
i
would
--
just
to
distinguish
the
case,
as
you
might
assume
a
tort
claim
against
due
for
personal
injuries.
if
the
tort
claim
is
for
injuries
caused
by
a
former
employee
of
yours
while
you're
engaged
in
business,
defending
the
claim
is
equally
attributable
to
the
business
activities
and
is
deductible
whether
or
not
the
judgment
will
be
paid
out
of
income
producing
or
non-income
producing
asset.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
tort
claim
is
--
arises
from
your
driving
an
automobile
for
pleasure,
i
can't
see
how
it
can
possibly
make
a
difference
that
the
judgment
is
going
to
expend
itself
on
income-producing
assets
rather
than
upon
personal
property.
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
reserve
my
--
rest
of
my
time
for
a
rebuttal.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
about
the
regulation
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir.
i
will
supply
a
memorandum
fee
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
to
solve
this
question
about
the
question
of
the
fact,
i
would
like
to
stipulate
that
80%
of
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
like
to
stipulate
that
80%
of
the
fees,
$32,000
would
pay
for
the
sole
reason
of
saving
his
property.
there's
no
question
about
that.
we
don't
deny
that.
there's
no
--
there's
no
question
about
that
in
any
case.
the
reason
you
defend
a
tort
suit
is
to
save
your
property.
you
have
no
other
interest
at
stake.
and
if
your
property
happens
to
be
an
income
producing
property,
the
property
you're
saving
is
income
producing
property.
it's
not
a
question
about
how
direct
the
relationship
is
or
what
the
facts
are.
the
question
is
whether
the
question
turns
up
on
that
relationship
or
upon
the
source
of
the
claim.
they're
entirely
different
things.
it's
a
direct
conflicting
fact
about
the
same
thing.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
patrick
case
which
follows
it,
were
argued
at
the
last
term
and
were
set
for
reargument
by
order
of
the
court.
they
are
income
tax
cases.
they
involved
the
deductibility
as
business
expenses
of
legal
fees
incurred
by
husband
in
connection
with
divorce
litigation,
resisting
or
settling
his
wife's
financial
or
property
claims.
the
deductions
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
or
settling
his
wife's
claims.
her
--
they
vary
--
the
two
cases
vary
a
bit
on
the
nature
of
claims,
i
will
deal
with
those
specifically
later.
the
claims
were
for
deduction
was
claimed
under
section
23
(a)
of
the
1939
code
and
successor
provisions
of
the
1954
code
which
in
all
material
respects
the
same.
section
23
(a)
allows
a
deduction
for
all
the
ordinary
necessary
expenses
incurred,
one,
in
carrying
on
any
trade
or
business
or
two,
for
the
production
or
collection
of
income
or
for
the
management
conservation
or
maintenance
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income.
specifically,
the
deductions
here
claimed
for
expenses
incurred
for
the
“conservation
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income”.
the
deductions
were
allowed
in
both
cases
on
broad
theory
that
since
the
husband
owned
income
producing
property
and
since
he
incurred,
he
is
to
keep
the
property
away
from
his
wife,
he
had
therefore
spent
the
moneys
for
the
purpose
of
conserving
income
producing
property.
and
very
broadly
our
position
in
opposition
to
that
is
that
the
deductibility
of
expenses
of
resisting
a
financial
claim
turns
not
upon
the
consequence
that
the
claim
would
have
if
you
fail
to
successfully
defeat
it,
namely
that
it
will
consume
income
producing
property.
but
rather
it
turns
upon
the
source
and
nature
of
the
claim,
the
transaction
from
which
the
claim
arose.
the
clearest
example
to
sharpen
that
difference
would
be
the
case
of
tort
litigation
for
personal
injuries
caused
in
automobile
accident,
let's
say
a
suit
for
$200,000.
the
rational
of
the
courts
in
these
cases
is
that
the
deductibility
of
the
expense
of
defending
that
tort
suit
would
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
property
that
the
defendant
happens
to
own
on
the
date
that
he
is
sued.
if
he
then
owned
income
producing
property,
then
the
expense
of
defeating
the
claim
would
allegedly
be
at
expense
of
conserving
that
property
because
if
he
lost
the
suit,
the
plaintiff
would
get
his
property.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
date
he
was
sued,
all
that
he
owned
happened
to
be
a
home
or
art
treasures
or
other
non-income
producing
property,
presumably
the
cost
of
defending
the
tort
suit
would
not
be
deductible.
now,
we
say
that
is
a
wholly
irrational
basis
upon
which
to
make
the
deductibility
of
defending
a
tort
suit
term.
it
turns
in
our
view
rather
upon
whether
the
accident
was
caused
by
an
employee
while
he's
making
deliveries
in
the
course
of
business
or
whether
the
accident
was
caused
by
--
in
driving
the
automobile
on
a
personal
trip
or
a
vacation
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
and
that
is
the
basic
dichotomy
whether
one
looks
to
the
threatened
consequence
of
the
claim
or
if
you
look
back
to
see
the
source
and
nature
of
the
claim.
this
case
in
the
gilmore
case
now
specifically
involves
a
litigated
divorce
proceeding
in
the
california
state
courts.
it's
uncomplicated
somewhat
by
the
presence
of
a
community
property
issue
which
distinguishes
this
case
from
most
of
the
cases
involved
the
question.
that
was
not
a
relevant
factor
in
the
court
of
claims
grounds
for
decision
and
i
propose
to
argue
the
case
more
broadly
in
the
terms
in
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
claims
first
and
then
deal
later
with
the
peculiar
problems
created
by
the
community
property
aspect.
at
the
time
of
the
divorce,
it
was
1952
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
the
gilmore
case,
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
claims.
as
i
said
yesterday,
it
involved
a
litigated
divorce
action.
the
deduction
claimed
is
for
the
cause
of
conducting
the
litigation
in
the
california
state
courts.
the
respondent
and
dixie
gilmore
were
married
in
1946.
in
1952,
after
six
years
of
marriage,
they
sued
each
other
for
divorce.
at
the
time
of
the
divorce
proceedings,
mr.
gilmore
owned
a
controlling
stock
interest
varying
from
60%
to
100%
and
three
corporations,
each
of
which
was
a
licensed
general
motors
automobile
dealer,
either
chevrolet
or
pontiac
dealerships.
he
was
the
president
and
the
managing
officer
of
each
of
the
corporations,
and
he
received
compensation,
salaries
from
the
three
corporations
totaling
approximately
$67,000
a
year
of
which
$15,000
came
from
don
gilmore-san
francisco
which
was
the
name
by
one
of
the
corporations
and
the
one
of
which
he
owned
100%.
his
dividends
in
the
three
corporations
averaged
about
$83,000
a
year
so
that
his
total
income
from
the
corporations
came
to
a
$150,000
a
year.
he
had
virtually
no
other
sources
of
income.
his
other
income
was
nominal.
one
of
the
issues
in
the
divorce
action
was
whether
the
stock
of
those
three
corporations
was
in
part
community
property.
mr.
gilmore
had
owned
the
stock
at
the
day
of
the
marriage
so
it
started
out
as
his
separate
property.
however,
during
the
six
years
of
the
marriage
from
1946
to
1952,
the
corporations
had
retained
some
$600,000
out
of
current
earnings.
and
mrs.
gilmore
claimed
that
those
earnings
in
excess
of
the
fair
rate
of
return
from
the
invested
capital,
the
corporations
should
be
attributed
to
the
personal
services
of
mr.
gilmore
and
therefore
were
community
property.
and
it
would
follow
from
that
that
by
leaving
the
earnings
in
the
corporations,
he
in
effect
made
a
contribution
to
capital
of
community
property
and
that
would
convert
the
stock
pro
tanto
to
the
extent
that
it
represented
the
retained
earnings
into
a
community
property.
mr.
gilmore
contended
that
he
had
been
paid
salaries
that
were
more
than
adequate
for
his
services
and
that
the
extraordinary
earnings
during
those
years
were
attributable
rather
to
the
good
fortune
of
the
corporations
in
having
the
chevrolet
and
pontiac
franchises
during
the
immediate
post-war
period.
now
that
issue
in
the
case
is
entirely
separate
in
terms
of
the
matters
of
proof
involved
from
all
the
other
issues.
the
other
issues
were
first
to
which
party
the
divorce
would
be
awarded.
dixie
gilmore
had
prayed
for
divorce
on
the
grounds
of
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery.
and
mr.
gilmore
had
counterclaimed
for
divorce
on
grounds
of
extreme
cruelty.
the
next
issue
was
whether
alimony
was
to
be
given
to
the
wife.
that
turned
upon
whether
she
got
the
divorce
or
not
because
in
the
california
law,
she
can
be
given
alimony
only
if
she
was
awarded
a
divorce.
and
the
third
issue
remaining
was
how
the
community
property,
if
there
was
any
community
property,
was
to
be
divided
between
the
parties.
now
under
california
law,
a
divorce
based
upon
extreme
cruelty
or
adultery
in
such
a
case,
the
court
is
required
to
divide
the
community
property
unequally
giving
more
than
half
and
up
to
all
of
the
property
to
the
innocent
spouse.
now
those
three
issues,
mainly
divorce,
alimony
and
division
of
community
property
all
involved
a
common
litigation
effort.
they
all
turned
on
the
same
thing,
namely,
which
party
got
the
divorce,
which
party
was
the
innocent
or
less
wrong
one
or
more
wrong
one.
the
case
went
to
trial,
turned
out
to
be
a
rather
sensational
trial
that
lasted
24
trial
days,
occupied
about
3000
pages
of
transcript
in
many
headlines
in
the
local
newspapers.
a
--
only
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
it
is
not.
it's
a
trial
to
the
court
as
i
understand
it.
the
main
bulk
of
the
trial
was
concerned
with
the
charges
and
the
counter
charges
of
misconduct;
adultery,
alcoholism,
physical
and
verbal
abuse,
a
charge
against
the
wife,
proof
or
that
she
engaged
in
abnormal
sex
acts
with
other
women,
charged
by
her
that
he
has
encouraged
her
to
do
so,
his
defense,
that
he
was
simply
an
onlooker.
it
was
described
by
appellate
court
as
one
of
the
most
sorted
cases
that
ever
had
to
deal
with
and
this
was
the
substance
of
the
trial.
and
it's
not
an
overstatement
to
say
that
the
question
here
is
whether
mr.
gilmore
can
deduct
his
business
expense,
the
cause
of
proving
that
his
wife
was
a
morally
defrayed
alcoholic.
that's
really
what
this
case
is
about.
the
outcome
of
the
trial
was
a
complete
victory
of
mr.
gilmore.
he
was
awarded
a
divorce.
his
wife
was
denied
a
divorce.
she
was
--
there's
got
to
be
no
community
property.
the
judge
initially
awarded
alimony
of
$9000
a
year
to
mrs.
gilmore
notwithstanding
that
he
denied
her
divorce
but
when
it
was
pointed
out
that
he
couldn't
do
that.
that
was
vacated.
she
appealed
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
california
which
reversed
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial
because
it
thought
the
judge
had
not
given
adequate
weight
to
the
proven
adultery
by
mr.
gilmore
in
the
period
following
the
divorce
complaint.
on
mr.
gilmore's
appeal
then
to
the
supreme
court
of
california,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
--
of
the
trial
court
was
reinstated.
and
the
final
result
was
that
mr.
gilmore
got
the
divorce
and
mrs.
gilmore
got
nothing.
in
1953
and
1954,
mr.
gilmore
had
expended
about
$40,000
in
conducting
this
litigation.
that's
attorney's
fees,
records,
transcripts,
and
the
like.
he
claimed
the
deduction
of
80%,
some
$32,000
of
those
--
of
the
total
cost
as
a
expense
deductible
under
23
(a)
(2)
of
the
1939
code.
that
is
to
say
an
ordinary
and
necessary
expense
incurred
for
the
management
conservation
for
maintenance
of
income
producing
property.
the
court
of
claims
accepted
the
allocation
of
the
expenses,
the
80%-20%
allocation
attributing
80%
of
the
fees
to
his
--
to
the
ultimate
purpose
of
protecting
his
interest
in
the
corporations.
this
is
a
factual
matter.
now
since
the
court
admitted
that
only
a
small
part
of
the
trial
was
directly
concerned
with
the
existence
of
community
property,
it
justified
that
80%
allocation
on
the
ground
that
as
a
second
line
of
defense,
it
was
necessary
to
prove
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
divorce
so
that
if
there
were
community
property,
it
can
be
awarded
to
him
nonetheless
and
could
not
--
or
be
awarded
to
the
wife
and
most
of
it
to
the
wife.
and
it
also
added
as
a
further
basis
to
support
the
allocation.
the
fear
of
mr.
gilmore
that
the
charges,
if
not
disproved
made
by
his
wife,
would
harm
his
reputation
and
cause
general
motors
to
cancel
the
corporation's
franchise.
now
on
the
--
taking
all
those
considerations
into
account,
it
accepted
the
allocation
that
80%
of
this
total
effort
was
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
his
interest
in
the
corporations
and
we
do
not
challenge
that
allocation.
now,
the
basis
on
which
the
court
held
that
that
part
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
do
not
here
challenge
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
said
--
i
don't
think
we
really
took
an
exception
to
the
total
allocation
in
the
court
of
claims
except
to
the
impossibility
of
making
the
application
but
in
any
event
here,
we
do
not
challenge.
there
is
a
question
about
what
it
represents,
what
the
80%
represents?
we
say
that
it
represents
only
in
part
the
cost
of
litigating
whether
there
was
community
property
because
that
was
only
a
small
part
of
the
trial
and
that
--
and
also
includes
a
large
part
of
the
expenses
of
litigating
the
misconduct
allegations
which
were
held
to
be
attributable
to
protecting
the
stock
interest
indirectly
and
namely
through
the
effect
on
the
division
of
community
property
and
through
the
effect
upon
reputation.
but
we
don't
challenge
if
--
we
properly
understand
the
findings
of
the
court
of
claims.
i
think
they're
quite
clear
on
that.
we
don't
challenge
them
at
all.
we
accept
that
80%,
$32,000
was
spent
solely
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
his
interest
in
the
corporations.
that's
why
he's
been
it.
that's
what
the
case
is
about.
we
accept
that.
now,
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
claims
held
that
that
amount
was
deductible,
how
it
qualified
under
23
(a)
(2)
was
not
looking
at
all
that
the
nature
of
the
claims
asserted
by
the
wife
but
solely
at
the
consequences
of
those
claims
if
they
were
not
defeated.
it
reasoned
that
if
the
wife
were
successful
in
her
claim,
she
was
entitled
for
$300,000.
that's
half
of
the
retained
earnings.
mr.
gilmore
would
be
required
to
dispose
of
the
large
part
of
his
stock
in
the
corporations,
either
to
sell
it
to
raise
the
money
or
give
it
to
her
in
kind.
in
that
event,
he
very
likely
would
have
lost
control
of
the
corporations
and
would
then
lose
his
overpaid
job
as
president
of
the
corporation.
and
indeed,
general
motors
might
cancel
the
franchises
because
of
the
change
of
ownership
if
it
hadn't
already
canceled
the
franchises
because
of
the
damage
of
his
reputation.
now,
because
of
these
disastrous
consequences
might
follow
from
her
claims
if
they
were
successful
the
court
said
resisting
them
and
avoiding
those
consequences
was
conservation
of
income
producing
property,
namely,
his
stock
and
his
job
in
the
corporations.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
i
mean
23
(a)
(2)
is
the
only
provision
under
which
they
could
be
claimed
that
i'm
aware
of.
there
is
another
provision
litigating
tax
liabilities
which
was
involved
in
the
davis
case
last
year
if
you
remember.
but
here,
the
only
relevant
provision
is
23
(a)
(2)
or
23
(a)
(1)
which
is
the
trade
or
business
expenses.
now,
our
position
as
i
suggested
yesterday,
is
that
the
aspect
that
you
look
to,
to
determine
the
character
of
the
expenses
is
not
of
the
consequences
that
will
follow
from
the
claim
--
from
the
judgment.
the
judgment
will
expend
itself
on
income
producing
property,
but
rather
the
source
of
the
claim,
the
transaction
from
which
the
claim
arose.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
considering
the
language
of
23
(a)
(2)
which
speaks
of
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
for
the
management,
conservation
or
maintenance
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income.
now
the
premise
of
the
decision
here
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
what
i
hope
to
prove.
i
think
that's
quite
clear
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
the
code
is
not.
the
code
--
the
caption
of
the
code
which
i
will
try
to
explain
later
is
really
a
misnomer,
calls
the
non-trade,
non-business
expenses.
this
is
23
(a)
(1).
the
23
(a)
(1)
allows
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
of
carrying
on
any
trade
or
business.
and
23
(a)
(2),
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
for
the
production
or
collection
of
income
or
for
the
management
conservation
or
maintenance
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income,
it's
our
position
and
this
is
all
one
ball
of
wax.
they're
all
of
business
expenses
but
i
would
develop
that
in
terms
of
the
history
of
23
(a)
(2).
but
there
was
some
concern
at
the
last
argument
about
the
literal
wording
of
23
(a)
(2)
and
how
we
deal
with
that.
i
would
like
to
start
out
by
considering
the
literal
wording
which
is
incurred
for
the
conservation,
for
the
management
conservation
and
maintenance
of
property
held,
the
production
of
income.
now,
the
premise
of
the
court
is
that
an
expense
incurred
to
avoid
a
liability
that
would
require
you
to
sell
property
that
happens
to
be
income
producing
to
raise
the
money
to
pay
the
liability
this
conservation
of
income
producing
property.
now,
i
suggest
that's
a
--
quite
an
awkward,
far
from
being
literal,
an
awkward
reading
of
conservation
of
property.
for
one
thing,
the
statute
speaks
of
property
and
not
of
an
interest
in
property.
now
what
mr.
gilmore
was
doing
here,
he
was
trying
to
keep
his
ownership
of
the
property
and
not
conserving
the
thing
itself.
conservation
equally
implies,
i
suggest,
a
physical
safeguarding,
a
protecting
of
the
thing.
the
--
for
--
in
terms
of
stocks
and
bonds,
the
conservation
would
be
the
fee
paid
for
the
safe
deposit
box
in
which
you
keep
them
so
they
don't
get
stolen,
and
equally
when
that
term
is
used
in
connection
with
management
and
maintenance
which
also
relate
to
the
operations
performed
with
respect
to
the
asset
of
the
thing
itself.
i
think
the
natural
reading
of
conservation
is
of
the
same
order
of
things.
there's
another
difficulty
with
the
literal
reading.
it
speaks
of
incurred
for
these
objects.
and
the
court
of
claims
says
that
since
these
objects
will
be
the
result
of
the
expense,
it
is
for
the
object.
but
that
uses
for
in
the
sense
of
the
result
achieved
prospectively
by
the
expense.
but
what
if,
for
example,
an
employee
hired
to
do
some
repairs
on
minimal
property,
negligent
and
causes
injury
and
you're
sued
for
that
and
you
try
to
deduct
the
fees
for
that,
that
the
fees
in
court
don't
achieve
maintenance
of
the
property,
there,
a
result
of
past
maintenance
efforts.
and
so
before
there,
you
have
to
turn
around
to
say
the
cost
of
maintenance
and
not
as
it
had
been
achieved
by
the
expenditure.
now
all
i'm
trying
to
really
suggest,
i
don't
--
we
aren't
arguing
that
you
should
read
the
statute
that
way,
and
i
think
purely
you
shouldn't.
all
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
that
our
argument
is
not
contrary
to
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
and
the
statute
is
so
broad
and
so
--
and
self-defining
that
we
have
to
look
elsewhere
for
its
meaning.
and
i
think
the
main
source
of
its
meaning
is
the
history
of
23
(a)
(2).
before
1942,
23
(a)
was
limited
--
limited
deductions
to
those
incurred
in
carrying
on
any
trade
or
business.
the
treasury
gave
that
from
a
narrow
construction
and
said
not
all
income
producing
activities
qualified
as
“trade
or
businesses”.
and
in
1941,
this
court
in
the
hagan's
case
and
two
other
cases
basically
adopted
that
construction.
they
held
that
simply
holding
stocks
and
bonds
is
not
a
trade
or
business.
and
therefore,
the
taxpayer,
mr.
higgins,
could
not
deduct
the
expenses
and
maintaining
the
staff
office
to
handle
his
investments,
his
portfolio
of
securities.
he
had
very
large
investments
and
a
full
time
office
staff,
just
having
the
dividend
checks
and
things
such
as
that.
it
was
held
that
he
could
not
deduct
those
expenses
because
it
didn't
qualify
as
a
trade
or
business.
congress
properly
responded
by
adding
23
(a)
(2).
and
the
committee
reports
say,
it
was
added
because
of
the
inequity
revealed
by
the
higgins
case,
a
tax
in
the
income
from
such
activities
for
not
allowing
the
deduction
of
the
ordinary
expenses
turning
them
on.
and
the
committee
reports
made
perfectly
clear
that
the
only
purpose
was
to
expand
the
kinds
of
activities
the
expenses
of
which
are
deductible
to
eliminate
the
distinction
between
the
technical
or
trade
or
business
and
other
kinds
of
income
producing
activities.
now
any
kind
of
income
producing
activity
whether
it'd
be
withholding
property
or
running
a
grocery
store
is
equally
entitled
on
a
subject
matter
for
deduction
of
expenses.
now
what
we
say
is
that
the
difference
between
23
(a)
(1)
and
(a)
(2)
is
little
--
concerns
solely
with
expanding
that
category
of
activities
and
does
not
affect
the
question
what
relationship
must
exist
between
an
expense
and
the
income
producing
activity
to
qualify
the
expense
as
an
expense
of
the
activity.
and
that's
the
question
in
this
case.
maybe,
i
can
put
it
this
way.
the
expense
here
is
claimed
as
an
expense
of
his
holding
of
stock.
now
before
1942,
expenses
of
stockholding
were
deductibleso
he
wouldn't
even
qualify
at
that
point.
23
(a)
(2)
says,
“yes,
expenses
of
stockholding
are
deductible”,
and
we're
left
with
the
question,
“is
this
an
expense
of
stockholding?”
or,
“is
this
an
expense
of
his
marriage?”
and
that's
the
question
in
this
case
and
that
question
23
(a)
(2)
is
not
directed
towards.
and
for
our
purposes,
we
can
call
23
(a)
(1)
and
23
(a)
(2)
as
both
providing
for
the
deduction
of
business
expenses,
ignoring
the
technical
distinctions
between
kinds
of
business
activity.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
he
is
sued
in
fact
for
damages
for
a
oral
contract
that
he
didn't
complete.
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
affecting
his
reputation
and
therefore
his
future
income
earning
capacity.
i
think
that
is
a
difficult
question.
i
think
the
answer
should
be
that
it's
not
deductible.
the
difficulty
rises
to
my
mind
not
because
of
the
impact
upon
his
income
earning
capacity
that's
going
to
hurt
his
future
business.
but
because
the
charge
rose
out
of
prior
business
activities,
i'm
assuming
that
it's
because
of
his
past
action
act
as
a
businessman
in
the
course
of
business
that
prompted
the
charge
and
that
was
really
the
generating
source.
now
actually,
let
me
say
that
my
main
point
is
simply
--
you
have
to
look
to
the
source
and
nature
of
the
claim
to
make
the
characterization.
now
once
you
look
there,
there
are
still
a
lot
of
problems
and
we
really
meet
them
in
this
case
because
of
the
community
property
aspect
of
the
case.
but
my
main
point
is
that
what
you
look
at
is
the
source
and
nature
of
the
claim
and
not
simply
the
effect
a
judgment
is
going
to
have.
now,
i
think
that
as
we
conclusively
decided
by
two
decisions
of
this
court,
the
kornhauser
case
and
the
lykes
case.
now,
the
kornhauser
case
involved
the
converse
situation,
a
claim
that
arose
from
a
business
transaction
but
threatened
only
personal
assets.
mr.
kornhauser
was
sued
by
an
ex-law
partner
of
his
who
claimed
that
some
fees
he'd
received
really
belonged
to
the
partnership
because
they
were
for
services
performed
while
the
partnership
was
in
existence.
he
successfully
defended
on
the
ground
that
he'd
earned
this
later.
and
that
this
court
held
that
the
expenses
were
deductible,
the
expenses
of
defending
that
lawsuit,
approving
a
line
of
ruling
that
had
held
deductible
the
expense
of
defending
malpractice
suits
and
suits
of
that
kind
and
saying
they
established
the
principle
that
if
it
results
from
the
conduct
of
the
business
is
deductible.
the
effect
of
the
judgment
is
not
the
question.
the
lykes
case,
i
think,
really
reads
directly
on
this
case
because
it
involves
a
claim
personal
in
origin
and
business
and
threatened
consequences.
that
was
involved
--
mr.
lykes'
may
give
large
flock
of
stock
to
members
of
his
family,
reported
them
for
gift
tax
purpose
of
stated
valuation.
the
commissioner
thought
the
valuation
too
low
and
his
litigation
about
what
the
value
of
the
stock
was
for
getting
tax
purposes.
it
was
ultimately
settled
by
his
paying
and
agreed
upon
decision.
he
claimed
the
deduction
for
the
expense
of
litigation
on
the
ground
that
had
the
original
petitions
he
had
been
sustained,
it
would
have
required
him
to
sell
all
of
--
the
rest
of
his
stock
which
was
his
sole
income
producing
property
and
therefore
resisting
the
deficiency
was
protecting
his
other
stock
and
it
was
a
conservation
of
income
producing
property.
in
this
court
and
words
which
i
think
is
directly
applicable
to
this
case,
said,
that
the
mere
fact
that
your
existing
liability
to
keep
income
producing
property
doesn't
make
any
expense
of
conserving
income
producing
property.
i
think
that
governs
this
case.
i
should
say
that
--
those
were
not
dealt
with
the
community
property
aspect
of
this
case.
very
briefly,
i
would
like
to
suggest
what
that
is.
first,
you
have
to
distinguish
the
two
kinds
of
expenses
involved
here,
those
litigating
the
misconduct
issues
and
those
for
litigating
the
existence
of
community
property.
as
in
this
conduct
issues,
the
suit
really
amounts
to
a
claim
for
a
remedy
for
personal
wrongs.
the
wife
is
claiming
that
she's
entitled
to
some
of
his
half
of
the
community
property
because
of
the
wrong
done
to
her
and
he
says
he's
entitled
to
some
of
her
half
because
of
the
wrong
done
him.
that's
simply
like
tort
suits
arising
from
the
wrongs
and
that's
the
genesis
of
the
rights
asserted.
that
we
say
follows
automatically
from
the
basic
principle
i'm
suggesting.
the
remaining
question,
the
small
part
of
the
fees
went
--
(inaudible)
specifically
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
part
of
the
stock
was
community
property.
we
acknowledge
this
poses
a
much
more
difficult
question.
even
if
you
looked
at
the
nature
of
the
claim,
you
still
have
a
problem
characterizing
it.
is
it
personal?
is
it
capital?
or
is
it
a
deductible
current
expense?
we
say
as
well
in
our
brief
that
if
you
reach
that
question,
we
think
it
is
clearly
--
quite
clearly
capital
and
it
probably
ought
to
be
treated
us
personal.
well
primarily,
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
you
don't
need
to
get
into
that,
that
isn't
quite
the
cases
here.
the
case
is
here
to
resolve
the
basic
dispute
about
whether
the
threat
to
income
producing
property
is
a
basis
for
deduction
if
that's
what
the
conflict
was
about
between
the
baer
case
and
the
second
circuit
case,
and
that's
why
we
brought
the
case
here
and
we
suggest
that
you
--
when
you
get
to
the
tail
end
of
the
case
in
achieving
this
community
property
issue,
you
can
properly
just
remand
that
for
consideration
by
the
court
of
claims
rather
than
in
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
right.
most
of
the
expenses
will
be
as
i
say
are
--
will
be
taken
care
of.
you
will
have
held
that
most
of
the
expenses
are
not
deductible.
mainly
those
incurred
in
litigating
the
misconduct
issues
are
not
deductible.
you
hold
back
and
you
hold
that
ground
for
the
broad
decision
the
court
of
claims
is
reversed.
that
leaves
a
further
problem
with
characterization.
we'd
fill
this
out
at
some
length
in
our
brief
which
was
not
dealt
with
by
court
of
claims.
now
logically,
you
could
decide
it.
to
me
it's
even
a
much
more
difficult
question
than
the
main
when
the
case
was
brought
here
to
decide
and
i
don't
see
why
the
court
should
get
into
it
and
simply
--
improperly
leave
that
to
the
court
of
claims
on
remand,
how
to
treat
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
hopefully.
hopefully,
thank
you.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
how
you
divide
them?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
part
allocable
to
the
issue
of
the
existence
of
the
community.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
you
decide
that
the
characterization
of
expenses
of
resisting
a
financial
claim
turns
upon
the
nature
and
source
of
the
claim.
therefore,
it
follows
that
the
claims
to
an
unequal
division
of
community
property
in
this
case
just
based
on
the
personal
wrongs.
the
expense
of
resisting
that
is
not
deductible
and
the
part
of
the
fees
which
were
allowed
that
are
attributable
to
that
part
of
the
litigation,
the
judgment
is
reversed
as
to
that
part.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
wouldn't
really
appear
in
terms
of
the
transcript
of
the
divorce
trial,
five-sixth
of
the
case
was
devoted
to
misconduct
issues,
only
one-sixth
to
the
existence
of
community
property.
that
would
mean
about
three
quarters
of
the
fees
allowed
would
be
nondeductible
under
what
we
are
suggesting
that
you
decide.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
just
a
number
of
pages
of
transcript.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
that's
an
accurate
measure
or
should
by
any
means
be
controlling.
the
court
of
claims
itself
did
find
that
the
major
part
of
expenses
were
concerned
with
litigating
this
conduct.
so
that
would
take
care
of
the
(inaudible)
--
the
larger
part
of
the
expenses
for
which
a
deduction
was
allowed.
and
that
would
leave
open
the
question
about
actually
make
this
allocation,
this
further
allocation
whether
the
amounts
allocated
specifically
litigating
whether
there
was
community
property
just
that
the
--
whether
the
stock
--
any
part
of
the
stock
was
community
property
--
existence
of
community
property
that
would
leave
open
that
question
whether
that
part
of
fees
would
be
deductible.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
no,
no,
no.
we
ask
you
to
--
you
can't
tell
what
part
it
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
because
that
allocation
hasn't
been
made.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now
we're
asking
you
to
decide
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
a
major
problem.
this
is
really
on
the
tail
end
fees
of
--
they
were
suggesting,
you
don't
need
to
decide.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
i
don't
believe
so.
the
--
our
regulations
--
say
generally,
expenses
in
connection
with
divorce
proceedings
are
not
deductible.
it
follows
--
there
follows
a
sentence
however,
the
part
of
the
wife's
fees
for
obtaining
alimony,
periodic
payments
of
alimony
which
are
taxable
to
her
as
income
are
deductible.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that's
alimony.
the
reference
of
22k
is
periodic
payments
of
alimony.
the
history
of
that
exception
is
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
on
page
45.
it's
specific
that
the
qualification
was
specifically
to
take
care
of
some
tax
court
decisions
that
it
held
that
when
congress
made
alimony
taxable
to
the
wife
as
income,
it
then
followed
that
the
expenditures
by
the
wife
in
giving
alimony,
that's
going
to
be
taxed
to
her
as
income
are
the
expenses
of
producing
income
and
therefore
deductible.
and
that's
the
sole
exception
met
by
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
believe
not
sir.
thank
you.
