justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
freed,
a
minute
ago,
you
said
that
it
should
be
a
trier
of
fact
to
determine
what
the
cause
of
relation
of
the
proximity.
that
means
that
if
the
trier
of
fact
as
a
jury
or
these
cases
may
come
before
jury
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
might
be
assuming
in
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
i
didn't
mean
the
divorce
action
but
this
allows
subsequently,
could
come
before
a
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
not
--
the
--
the
disallowance
of
the
commissioner
of
the
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
refund
case
and
that
may
come
before
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
that
an
appropriate
charge
have
been
made
to
a
jury
saying
it's
for
you
gentleman
of
the
--
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
to
find
how
closely
connected
this
is
and
whatever
they
find
would
control
under
decisions
of
this
court,
is
that
right?
if
this
is
a
jury
question,
if
this
a
matter
put
to
the
jury
on
a
general
charge,
that
the
determination
of
the
closeness,
the
consequences
and
therefore,
let
me
take
this
course
to
simplify
the
matter
before
the
congress
--
before
a
judge
of
a
trier
of
fact
and
this,
as
i
find
that
this
is
closely
connected
with
the
proper
consolation
of
property.
another
jury,
another
judge
sitting
alone
might
take
a
contrary
view
and
these
findings
would
be
sustained,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
connection
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
in
every
case
in
which
--
in
every
case
of
this
sort
in
which
there's
a
rundown
between
the
two
spouses
and
their
lawyers
with
reference
to
making
the
best
kind
of
a
settlement,
the
property
interest
would
be
involved
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
but
if
--
whenever
there
is
a
controversy
about
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
don't
reach
a
settlement,
there
would
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
anyhow
for
a
sufficient
number
of
time.
this
is
in
the(inaudible),
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
we
really
--
what
this
court
will
do
in
this
case
will
affect
a
lot
of
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
done
too
rare
these
days
unfortunately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now,
all
these
leads
up
to
what
i
would
ask
you.
is
this
--
is
it
fare
to
say
that
this
is
a
question
of
fact,
for
the
trier
of
fact,
leading
to
these
inevitable
and
appropriately
leading
to
these
diversities
of
judgment
or
is
it
one
of
these
cases
which
we,
lawyers
call
questions
of
law
in
the
sense
that
it
isn't
a
question
for
the
jury
that
a
line
has
to
be
drawn,
namely,
whether
you
take
one
view,
whether
the
expenditures
relate
directly
and
indirectly
and/or
contingent
ego
is
a
well-known
concepts
of
the
law.
isn't
it
that
kind
of
a
problem
rather
than
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
leading
to
all
these
diversities
on
exactly
the
same,
not
assessment
of
evidence,
not
judgment
of
more
or
less
but
a
guiding
line?
is
it
necessary
here
to
establish
a
guiding
line
and
that's
what
we
mean
by
rule
of
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
--
i
was
just
imagining
that
in
my
limited
imagination
the
kind
of
speeches
that
will
be
made
to
juries
in
this
case,
the
kind
of
a
speech
that
one
man
would
make
that
he
really
didn't
care
about
her,
he
tried
to
get
rid
of
her
but
he
didn't
want
to
have
this
much
money
as
against
the
fact
that
he
--
to
get
rid
of
her
implied
or
may
involve
some
publicity
and
that
may
jeopardize
his
license
from
general
motors.
i
can
imagine
a
wonderful
kind
of
oratory
before
juries
on
this
question
of
whether
it's
primary
or
secondary
or
whether
there's
a
--
there's
a
condominium,
a
juncture
of
motives,
i
think
the
wonderful
thing
to
embark
on
speculation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
stimulation
and
we
lawyers
indulge
in
that
with
pleasure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
be
better
for
the
12
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
dilute
a
different
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
have
a
co-mingling
of
factors
and
forces,
one
of
which
is
--
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
conserving
the
property
and
some
of
which
may
have
to
do
--
you
to
deal
some
--
you
have
to
deal
with
the
statute
whether
the
statute
allows
you
to
just
have
a
little
infusion
of
conserving
property,
remotely
or
as
a
distant
consequence
or
whether
that
statute
says
you
must
have
that
or
you
mustn't
use
the
word
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
the
real
trouble
that
in
some
--
in
one
sense,
there
is
conservation
of
property
in
one
sense.
ultimately,
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
to
the
total
asset
or
to
the
potentiality
with
future
earnings,
but
is
that
what
the
statute
goes
out
--
and
we
go
out
to
something
else
but
you
can't
escape
this
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
a
word
you
used,
your
word
primary,
whatever
word
you
may
use,
you
are
confronted
with
the
question,
does
the
statute
of
conserving
property
relate
to
have
it
or
threats
(inaudible)
demolition
or
actual
demolition
of
property
in
the
first
line
of
fire
or
way
beyond
it.
that's
really
what's
involved
in
here,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
question
is
whether
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
whether
--
on
what
basis
the
trier
--
the
trier
of
fact
went.
the
trier
of
fact
doesn't
grab
anything
out
of
the
sky
and
says
this
is
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
some
kind
of
considerations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
to
determine
what
the
statute
means
and
what
does
it
direct
towards.
you've
got
an
entangled
situation
means
we
have
to
disentangle
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
hear
you.
