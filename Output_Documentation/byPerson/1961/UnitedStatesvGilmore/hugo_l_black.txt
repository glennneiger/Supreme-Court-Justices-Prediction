justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
not
weaken
your
position
on
the
fact
that
it
has
been
--
you
add
the
word
primarily
to
the
words
of
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
each
time
you've
said
--
the
statute
says,
all
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
paid
or
incurred
during
the
taxable
year
for
the
production
and
selection
of
income
or
for
the
management
and
conservation
and
maintenance
of
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
each
time
you
say,
so
long
as
you
primarily
for
this
management
conservation
and
so
forth
of
the
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
have
to
get
to
motive
and
purpose
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
field.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
somebody
who's
knocked
this
man's
life,
had
sued
him
for
this
property
that
he
owned,
would
you
have
to
prove
that
his
dominant
purpose
in
defending
it
or
primary
purpose
in
defending
it
would
keep
the
other
person
from
getting
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
different
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
about
his
fighting
to
conserve
his
income
producing
property.
i
don't
see
why
your
word
primary
gets
you
far
in
your
direction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
assume.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
your
answer
to
that
if
there
is
an
answer,
if
you're
right,
it
would
be
not
lifted.
if
you're
to
get
something,
you
can
collect
the
fee
but
so
far
as
it
was
paid
for
the
purpose
of
(inaudible)
rather
than
to
fight
over
the
property.
it
may
be
that
you
can't
divide
those
up.
i
can
understand
an
argument
like
that.
i
don't
understand
why
you'd
look
--
see
whether
its
primary
purpose
was
to
find
a
service
for
the
property
whether
its
primary
purpose
was
to
concern
his
property.
the
problem
would
be
a
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
that
is
a
fact
he
paid
this
fee
for
the
purpose
of
conserving
his
interest
in
this
income
producing
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
had
--
if
you
had
a
lawsuit
by
one
count,
it
had
nothing
to
do
whatever
in
conserving
property
but
another
one
did,
i
do
not
suppose
that
you
would
be
barred
from
recovering
part
of
the
fee
that
is
attributable
to
the
conservation
of
property
merely
because
somebody
was
afraid
of
the
idea
of
co-mingling.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
if
you
would
--
has
done
nothing
here
except
the
suit
to
divorce,
you
wouldn't
be
claiming
that
--
you
could
get
it
for
trying
to
conserve
your
property,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
nothing
but
a
personal
lawsuit
for
divorce
between
these
people,
you
wouldn't
be
claiming
you
could
deduct
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
claiming
is
that
the
state
of
fee,
a
part
of
which
was
for
conserving
estate
had
income
bearing
for
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
statute
says
that
you
can
deduct
maintenances,
management
conservation
or
maintenance
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income,
i
presume
you're
saying
if
--
you
shouldn't
be
barred
because
one
fee
was
paid
for
both
purposes.
one
part
--
part
of
it
didn't
--
wasn't
deductible
from
your
standpoint
and
one
for
the
(inaudible),
you're
claiming
it
for
the
part
of
the
fee
that
was
attributable
to
the
conservation
of
the
income.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
that
put
in?
do
you
know
of
any
particular
reason
given
by
adding
that
law?
is
that
part
of
the
second
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
is
that?
