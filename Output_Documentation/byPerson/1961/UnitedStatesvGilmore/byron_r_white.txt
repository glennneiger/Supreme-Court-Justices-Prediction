justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
a
jury
trial
in
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless
you
leave
rather
a
narrow
area
from
divorce
proceedings
where
the
deductibility
of
any
attorney's
fees
arising
out
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
divorce
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
does
--
don't
the
regulations
themselves
contemplate
to
saving
23
(a)
(2)
expenses
in
a
divorce
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
39
--
24
(a)
(1)
says,
however,
the
part
of
the
attorney's
fees
paid
in
the
divorce
for
separate
maintenance
proceeding
which
is
properly
attributable
to
the
production
or
collection
of
amounts
and
equitable
in
gross
income
under
22k
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
deductible
under
23
(a)
(2).
justice
byron
r.
white
--
none
of
that
element
in
here
--
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
gilmore?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
basically
--
do
you
basically
dispute
the
government's
contention
that
the
solution
should
rest
upon
the
source
of
the
--
rather
than
the
character
of
the
expenditure.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
take
it,
the
government
is
saying
that
if
--
that
this
generally,
attorney's
fees
and
divorce
actions
are
nondeductible
as
the
regulation
says
but
the
sole
exception,
that
is
carved
out
in
as
--
in
that
last
sentence
of
that
regulation.
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
since
it
--
that
--
since
22
--
an
item
of
23
(a)
(2)
expenses
is
saved
by
the
regulation
so
are
others.
justice
byron
r.
white
actually,
this
is
the
23
(a)
(1)
expense
that
is
saved
and
you
say
that
if
23
(a)
(1)
expenses
are
saved
so
are
23
(a)
(2)
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
a
23
(a)
(2),
that's
right.
