you
said
that
there
could
be
no
deduction
in
respect
to
the
attorney's
fees
in
connection
with
the
divorce
proceeding.

in

or

regul

regulation
seems
to
contemplate
that
there
are
some
kinds
of
expenses,
attorney's
fees

justice

(voice

with
the
divorce
proceedings
which
are
deductible
which
is

justice

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
in
the
first
case,
gilmore,
the
suit,
the
petition,
immunity
of
property
has
been
brought
during
the
existence
of
the
marital
relationship.
in
other
words,
supposing
that
you
have
the
situation
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
gilmore
is
existing
during
the
marital
--
justice
john
m.
harlan

relationship.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
those
expenses
had
been
deductible?
justice
john
m.
harlan
take
the
situation
that
the
--
perhaps
it's
the
most
familiar
one,
the
reno
divorce,
a
so-called
friendly
divorce.
there
are
two
steps
in
that
always,
one
is
--
really
only
one
step
actually.
lawyers
negotiate
a
separation
agreement
which
is
in
fact
a
property
agreement.
is
it
your
view
that
irrespective
of
whether
it's
a
community
property
estate
or
not
that
if
the
separation
agreement
involves
dealing
with
income
producing
property
that
the
attorney's
fees
are
--
in
that
case
are
deductible?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
realize
that
but
i
--
your
view
would
stretch
to
that
standard.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
whether
congress
had
in
mind
one
way
or
the
other
the
--
this
kind
of
a
situation
when
they
enacted
2382?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
problem
that
confronts
you
would
be
greatly
simplified
that
the
lawyers
stood
up
their
bill
and
said
so
much
in
this
financial
settlement
by
representation
and
so
much
as
to
the
divorce
angle
and
then
all
you
have
question
--
the
only
question
you
have
assuming
the
statute
covers
it
at
all
is
whether
the
--
that's
a
bona
fide
allocation
of
this
or
whether
it's
an
unreasonable
fee
then
you
don't
get
tangled
up
with
the
problem
that
concerns
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
second
case,
you've
got
that
allocation
by
the
lawyers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
the
regulation
(voice

to
be.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
was
just
observing
but
i
think
that's
a
very
sensible
position
for
you
to
take.
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
the
only
basis
that
exist
or
(inaudible)
attorney
fees?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
not
deciding
whether
that
sort
of
expense
is
deducted.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
just
a
question
on
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
you
divide
it?
the
ultimate
question
was
whether
that's
deductible.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
in
agreement
with
mr.
barnett's
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
mr.
gilmore
had
had
nothing
but
cash
instead
of
securities
or
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
wouldn't
be
here,
would
you?
