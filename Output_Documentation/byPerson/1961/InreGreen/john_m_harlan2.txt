the
substance
of
your
position
as
i
understand
it
is,
that
what
realistically
happened
here,
do
view
the
record,
is
that
he
committed
--
this
young
man
committed
a
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the
court
on
june
1
and
june
3,
and
that
the
record
should
be
taken
as
if
the
judge
had
said,
“we
are
now
in
contempt.
you
turn
on
june
7th
for
sentencing.”

you're

that
your
position?

suggesting
it.
