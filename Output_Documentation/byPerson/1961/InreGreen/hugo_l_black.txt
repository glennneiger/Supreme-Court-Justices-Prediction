where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
june
7th.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
court
released
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
gave
the
bond?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
supreme
court
say
about
the
oliver
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
they
rely
on
for
finding
if
this
lawyer
had
violated
him
justice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
evidence
did
they
rely
on
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
he
had
violated
the
order?
what
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
treat
that
as
a
confession
of
valid
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
oliver,
we
said,
this
court
has
said
that
knowing
the
knowledge
required
from
the
testimony
of
others
or
even
from
the
confession
of
the
accused
were
not
just
a
fact
conviction
without
a
trial
in
which
there
was
an
opportunity
to
present.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
here?
justice
hugo

black
is
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
docket
sheet
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
where
is
it
so
we
can
see
the
order
he's
given?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
yet,
when
you
take
it
up
to
the
judge
i
suppose,
it
sounds
like
practicing
and
take
it?
take
it
up
with
the
judge,
signing
up,
file
a
motion,
dissolve
a
restraining
order
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

be
and
then
he
would
say,
“well,
i'll
hear
you
next
saturday.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
you'd
notified
the
counsel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
a
writ
issued
on
the
order
that
you
say
is
on
the
docket
sheet,
an
actual
paper
that
was
written
or
issued
that
the
sheriff
served
on
the
union?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
if
we
could
have
be
--
be
agreeable
if
we
had
the
original
paper?
it
seems
this
record
doesn't
have
the,
for
my
purposes,
the
papers
that
are
necessary
to
decide
the
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
copy
of
the
papers
in
the
or
rather
the
written
notes
in
the
injunction
sue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
which
this
contempt
arose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
include
the
--
i
suppose
the
petition
and
any
papers
that
were
issued
on
a
petition
or
any
notation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
perhaps
this
writ,
we
would
call
it
had
some
notation
whether
it
was
a
restraining
order,
whether
it
was
an
attempt
for
injunction
or
whether
this
is
what
it
was,
what
he
thought
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
agreeable
to
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
there
was
a
contempt
here,
where
it
was
committed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
it
committed
if
it
was
committed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
and
what
was
it?
was
it
committed
in
open
court?
justice
hugo

black
it
was
something
(voice

--
justice

were
something
said
to
the

that
(voice

justice

did
he
give
an
order
to
the
union
men
to
--
to
disobey
the
court's
order
in
the
court's
presence?
justice
hugo

black
where
did
he
if
he
gave
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
outside
the
courtroom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
--
is
it
your
view
that
a
man
who
commits
the
contempt
outside
the
courtroom
engages
in
conduct
outside
the
courtroom
can
be
brought
out
by
a
judge
inside
without
a
charge,
serve
no
name
with
notice,
and
without
producing
evidence
and
that
having
a
hearing
to
determine
not
merely
what
the
evidence
was
against
him,
but
what
were
the
excuses
if
he
had
it
so
that
he
is
given
a
hearing
in
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
--
in
your
judgment,
does
--
does
the
law
permit
such
a
conviction
of
contempt
committed
outside
the
court
where
it
requires
evidence
outside
the
court
--
from
outside
the
court,
a
witness,
without
a
notice,
without
a
charge
and
without
a
hearing
of
witness,
a
chance
for
the
defendant
to
put
on
his
witness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
show
me
--
show
me
that,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that
you
could
try
that
way
--
have
you
read
oli
--
oliver
and
murchison
cases
and
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
think
that
in
ohio,
they
can
without
violating
due
process
of
law
under
those
cases,
try
a
man
for
conduct
committed
outside
the
courtroom,
without
a
charge,
not
him
being
allowed
to
come
in
and
hear
the
witnesses
against
him
and
to
let
the
witnesses
be
heard
by
him,
merely
because
the
court
said
that
he
heard
he
make
a
statement
somewhere
that
he
had
done
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
--
would
that
--
not
that
more
likely
called
but
trial
by
different
judge
on
our
opinion
rather
than
to
let
the
judge
depend
on
what
he
says
he
heard
about
what
a
man
had
done
outside
the
courtroom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
think
so.
justice
hugo

i
say
i
would
think
so
if
you
refer
to
our
case
the
court's
restraining
order.
justice

what
date
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
was
that
the
date
where
you
say
the
contempt
proceeding
would
be
done
and
finished
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't?
justice

i
understood
you
to
say
it
was
on
contempt,
was
i
wrong?
justice

what
date
did
you
say
the
contempt
proceeding
was
started
against
green?
justice

where

where
are
the
charges
that
were
made
on
june
the
6th,
if
you
say
he
was
charged
for
contempt?
justice

where
is
that?
justice
hugo

black
well,
how
could
that
have
been
shown
except
by
showing
what
he
told
them
by
witnesses
in
the
courtroom?

he
said
so?

i'm

he

what

it

justice

what
page
is
that
on?
i
like
to
read
the
sentence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whenever
it's
put
in
the
(inaudible)
the
court
solemn,
he
would
not
let
them
testify
to
those
facts,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
connection
with
finding
whether
he
was
guilty
of
contempt
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
merits,
you
--
and
it's
about
the
merits
i
guess.
is
it
your
position
that
if
a
lawyer
honestly
believes
that
his
clients
can
only
get
a
test
by
appeal
by
violating
an
order
temporarily
to
get
that
test?
and
he
communicates
that
information
to
them
that
he
is
a
bad
man
or
guilty
of
a
contempt
or
(inaudible)
man,
if
that's
what's
done,
is
it
your
judgment
that
he
should
restrain
himself
from
seeing
what
he
honestly
believes
as
the
law
when
he
talks
to
his
clients?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
cannot
then
get
anything,
can
you,
from
the
fact
that
he
told
his
clients
as
he
said
over
the
phone
or
somewhere
in
chicago,
that
the
only
way
he
saw
it
could
be
raised
was
for
them
to
picket?
you
do
not
think
that
was
contempt,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
he
told
them
that
was
the
only
way
he
saw
to
raise
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
--
would
you
put
a
lawyer
in
to
jail
for
contempt
who
advises
his
clients
what
he
honestly
believes
to
be
the
law,
when
he
says
that
the
only
one
way
that
i
see
you
can
raise
it,
and
that
is
by
picketing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
well,
do
you
--
i
--
i'm
taking
that
part
of
it
because
it
has
to
be
based
on
that.
there
has
been
no
--
no
hearing
to
determine
how
much
further
he
went
from
that
in
his
statement,
as
i
read
it,
said
he
went
no
further.
and
you
continue
to
say
that
he
acted
bad
before
the
court
when
all
frankly
i
can
see
that
he
did
was
to
continue
to
take
the
position.he
had
told
him
that
and
that
was
the
only
way
he
saw
to
raise
it,
and
you
think
he
should
go
to
jail
for
that,
do
you?
i
continue
to
take
the
position
that
he
did
not
merely
advise
them
that
the
order
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
then
that
you
cannot
rest
your
contempt
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
he
gave
his
lawyer
honest
advice
that
in
his
best
judgment,
the
only
way
to
raise
it
was
by
picketing.
you
do
not
rest
your
case
of
convic
--
base
your
conviction
on
that,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that,
just
that
alone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
--
if
you
assume
that
he
honestly
advised
his
clients
that
in
his
best
judgment,
seems
to
me
like
there's
plenty
of
room
for
argument
because
you've
been
arguing
it
once
you
said,
the
only
way
to
raise
this
was
by
picketing
and
he
told
them
that,
would
you,
if
that
was
all
he
did,
say
that
the
con
--
the
conviction
was
justified?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
asking
you
if
he
told
them
that
the
only
way
as
he
use
to
get
away
from
particular
words,
if
he
told
them,
gave
them
honest
advice
that
in
his
judgment,
that
was
the
only
way
this
question
could
be
raised,
and
that
was
all
you
had
and
he
believes
that,
would
you
say
that
he
could
be
convicted
for
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
so
--
if
so
than
a
lawyer
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
cannot
give
his
law
--
his
clients
advice,
if
--
if
there's
been
an
injunction
issued
against
him
which
he
thinks
is
bad,
is
there,
you
--
you
would
say
that
he
can't
advise
his
clients
that
“i
have
--
i'm
sorry
but
there's
no
way
i
can't
raise
this
except
for
you
to
commit
contempt”.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
not
talking
about
--
i
don't
understand
non
sequitur.
what
i'm
asking
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
if
you
say
that
a
lawyer,
that
in
ohio,
a
lawyer
can
be
sent
to
jail
for
contempt
of
court
who
does
no
more
to
give
his
client,
who's
been
in
joint,
he
advised
honest
view
which
he
honestly
entertained
in
which
is
disputable
as
shown
here,
that's
all
he
does,
that
your
court
could
convict
him
for
contempt
instead
of
(inaudible).
justice

would
you
say
that
you
could
or
would
not?
just
on
that.
justice

black
i
--
no,
i
want
to
ask
--
i
want
you
to
answer
this
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'll
say,
yes,
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that's
a
dispute
in
fact,
why
would
--
why
didn't
they
--
didn't
they
have
a
hearing
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
chance
--
what
chance
does
this
judge
have,
give
him
to
go
into
the
merits
of
what
he
had
advised
his
clients
an
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
listen
to
your
argument
on
that
here,
and
i
must
say
that
i
cannot
agree
that
you
are
authorized
to
say
after
this
argument
that
an
honest
lawyer
couldn't
have
honestly
given
his
view.
as
i
understand
you,
he
had
to
go
before
this
judge
who
had
issued
this
injunction.
he
was
already
impatient.
you
say
he
had
--
he
could
have
gone
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
might
in
his
discretion
have
--
have
decided
it.
supposed
he
honestly
believe
that
the
judge
wouldn't
do
it,
should
he
have
told
him
that
he
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
judge
was
not
going
to
dissolve
that
injunction
and
not
going
to
act
on
it
until
the
time
had
passed
within
which
they
would
lose
their
right
to
test
it
out
in
the
upper
court.
justice
hugo

where
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
that
mean
about
the
court?
what
had
the
court
told
him?
how
long
did
the
court
tell
him
it
would
take?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
did
he
say
--
did
he
guarantee
it
would
take,
a
week
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo

black
(inaudible)
justice

but
do
you
agree
to
this
agreement?
justice

black
may
i
ask
you,
and
then
a
contempt
motion
was
filed
after
that?
justice

no,
i'm
not
against
you
