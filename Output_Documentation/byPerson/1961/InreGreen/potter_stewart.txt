is
something
else.

pending
a
hearing
on
a

everything

everything
can
handle
a
county
or

be
view
--
viewed
as
a
contempt
committed
in
the
presence
of
the

rather
than
as
indirect
contempt.
and
i
think
you
were
not

didn't
have
it
to
pursue
that
this
way.
justice

answering
a
question
that
i
asked
you

i
appreciate

authority,
perhaps
what
you
mean
is

of
that.

didn't
consult
any
people.
